1
00:02:43,406 --> 00:02:44,288
Madame.

2
00:02:44,906 --> 00:02:46,901
My boyfriend, he's gone.
Someone took him.

3
00:02:47,026 --> 00:02:48,125
A kidnapping?

4
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:50,198
Did you see anyone or anything?

5
00:04:09,518 --> 00:04:12,826
That that hot little number you was with
at that frog restaurant?

6
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:15,337
If she was hot,
how come you didn't nab her too?

7
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,995
- Not telling you anything.
- So that's a yes.

8
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:19,856
<i>Sayonara</i>, Sookie.

9
00:04:22,374 --> 00:04:23,596
Who the hell are you?

10
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:26,296
How about you just call us
the Fuck You Crew.

11
00:05:47,264 --> 00:05:49,306
AB+ Team

12
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,924
.:: La Fabrique ::.

13
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:04,538
So he proposes to you,
and you said what again?

14
00:06:04,663 --> 00:06:06,582
That I needed a minute to think.

15
00:06:09,377 --> 00:06:12,891
Aren't you gonna stop her
from trampling all over the crime scene?

16
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:15,603
Why aren't you taking this seriously,
Kenya?

17
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:18,377
- My boyfriend's been kidnapped.
- It is Deputy Jones.

18
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:21,518
And I'd appreciate
you addressing me as such.

19
00:06:21,643 --> 00:06:24,383
- How long were you in the bathroom?
- No more than a minute or two.

20
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,082
- Was it one minute or two?
- What difference does it make

21
00:06:27,207 --> 00:06:28,971
when every second
you spend questioning me,

22
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:31,007
these bastards are getting
further away?

23
00:06:31,132 --> 00:06:33,034
What if there were no bastards?

24
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:35,978
What if, while you were in the
bathroom for a minute or two,

25
00:06:36,213 --> 00:06:38,939
your vampire friend realized
he didn't want to be humiliated anymore

26
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,067
- and took off?
- Why the tables are turned-over?

27
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,286
Because that looks like
evidence of a struggle.

28
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,656
To me, it looks like a man
lost his temper.

29
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:48,131
With good reason.

30
00:06:48,869 --> 00:06:49,869
Come on.

31
00:06:50,537 --> 00:06:53,187
Just file a missing persons
report for me.

32
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,016
- Please?
- 48 hours, that's the rule.

33
00:06:56,141 --> 00:06:58,025
You want a lift back to town or not?

34
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:01,795
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

35
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:04,357
<i>Merci beaucoup</i> for nothing.

36
00:07:05,618 --> 00:07:07,875
Because then... Then I just
walked outside and...

37
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,750
I ran outside,
and then he was laying there.

38
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:13,182
And I heard Tara coming up
behind me,

39
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,796
and I didn't want her to see that.
I tried to stop her,

40
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,721
but she busted on through.

41
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,939
And she threw herself on him,
and it was just so sad.

42
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
Hey, coz.

43
00:07:32,336 --> 00:07:33,869
I know what you're going through.

44
00:07:35,616 --> 00:07:36,916
That first kill,

45
00:07:37,133 --> 00:07:40,716
it's got a way of making you feel
like that's all you are.

46
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,480
But you've got to know

47
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:47,591
that you are still a man
that is capable of goodness

48
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:51,884
and of heartbreak
and generosity of spirit.

49
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:54,300
And if you can cling to that

50
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,560
with everything you got,

51
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,380
you gonna be all right.

52
00:08:00,595 --> 00:08:01,522
I promise.

53
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:04,196
Thank you...

54
00:08:06,006 --> 00:08:07,011
for that.

55
00:08:09,664 --> 00:08:11,782
- I love you, coz.
- I love you too.

56
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:15,494
From now on,
let's tell each other that more.

57
00:08:16,316 --> 00:08:18,413
All right, Andy.
Ready for your statement now.

58
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,057
I hope I was helpful,
Sheriff Dearborne,

59
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,063
because last time we did this,
after Rene, I know I wasn't.

60
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:29,671
But I have the utmost respect
for y'all,

61
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,390
because without law enforcement,

62
00:08:32,515 --> 00:08:35,226
we would be nowhere as a society.

63
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:37,021
What the fuck, Arlene?

64
00:08:37,506 --> 00:08:39,101
This ain't a goddamn beauty pageant.

65
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:43,560
The only man I ever loved
was just zipped up in a bag,

66
00:08:43,714 --> 00:08:46,590
and you don't even have the decency
to pretend you give a fuck.

67
00:08:46,715 --> 00:08:48,152
I give a fuck.

68
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:51,594
But I don't know what I expect.
Trash is as trash does.

69
00:08:51,719 --> 00:08:54,639
I'm sorry you fell in love
with a serial killer, all right?

70
00:08:54,764 --> 00:08:56,491
But honestly, who here hasn't?

71
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,106
- Bitch, Eggs wasn't no killer!
- He confessed.

72
00:08:59,231 --> 00:09:01,373
Please.
This is a murder investigation.

73
00:09:01,683 --> 00:09:03,314
I don't care what he confessed to.

74
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:06,555
- He ain't responsible for it!
- Why? Because of society?

75
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,360
- Because of slavery?
- Sweetheart...

76
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,966
- You fucking redneck!
- I'm gonna take Tara to Sookie's.

77
00:09:11,251 --> 00:09:13,733
Bud, if you want to talk to her,
you can meet us over there.

78
00:09:13,858 --> 00:09:16,104
And we're gonna steal
this tequila over here,

79
00:09:16,229 --> 00:09:19,057
but I doubt that'd surprise
any of y'all. Come on. Come on.

80
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:21,518
Stupid-ass racist dyed haired bitch.

81
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:26,148
I hate
when they make everything about race.

82
00:09:28,363 --> 00:09:29,234
Come on.

83
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,747
Come on. No, you stay with me, okay?

84
00:09:32,705 --> 00:09:33,705
Come on.

85
00:09:34,027 --> 00:09:35,027
Hosp...

86
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:37,449
pital.

87
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:41,747
No, I'm sorry.
I can't take you to the hospital.

88
00:09:42,357 --> 00:09:44,107
Just wait here.
Come on.

89
00:09:46,441 --> 00:09:48,394
You're a fucking whore.

90
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,700
I know.

91
00:09:53,295 --> 00:09:54,395
I know I am.

92
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:01,449
Fuck.

93
00:10:05,027 --> 00:10:06,027
Hey, there.

94
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:10,192
- Is Bill here?
- No, it's just me hanging out.

95
00:10:10,425 --> 00:10:12,360
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, totally.

96
00:10:13,323 --> 00:10:14,523
I mean, I'm...

97
00:10:14,648 --> 00:10:18,199
Things are so fucked up with Hoyt,
so I've been crying, but I'm fine.

98
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:21,190
- Bill's been kidnapped.
- What?

99
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,497
I thought y'all were gonna dinner.

100
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,431
We were, but he proposed and...

101
00:10:25,556 --> 00:10:27,304
Oh, my God. Wait, Sookie.

102
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:28,876
I didn't say yes.

103
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,611
You rejected him?

104
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,790
It's not like that.
Just...

105
00:10:33,058 --> 00:10:35,960
If he does come home for any reason,

106
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:39,204
call me and let me know,
even if he commands you not to.

107
00:10:39,329 --> 00:10:40,389
You know I can't.

108
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,707
I don't care.

109
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:43,517
Just do it.

110
00:10:48,334 --> 00:10:50,205
Shit.
Fuck. Shit.

111
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:56,680
Whatever-your-name-is,
wake up, okay?

112
00:11:17,683 --> 00:11:19,133
Maybe this'll work.

113
00:11:38,991 --> 00:11:42,372
I can't tell whether my skin
is burning up or if it's freezing,

114
00:11:42,497 --> 00:11:44,979
but it feels so fucking good.

115
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:47,622
Pull over, Jimmy.

116
00:11:47,818 --> 00:11:49,624
I gotta get me a drag
off of this fuck.

117
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,732
Nope, we ain't stopping.

118
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,128
I'm dying over here.

119
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,339
Spit some in his mouth.

120
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,451
What?

121
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:57,841
That's gay.

122
00:11:58,009 --> 00:12:01,011
And playing with your own titties
in a car full of dudes ain't?

123
00:12:01,952 --> 00:12:03,764
It's the only way
you're getting any V.

124
00:12:04,711 --> 00:12:05,611
Come on.

125
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:08,727
Can't fucking believe
I'm doing this.

126
00:12:21,535 --> 00:12:23,806
You're the one in charge,
is that correct?

127
00:12:23,931 --> 00:12:24,904
Oh, shit.

128
00:12:25,029 --> 00:12:28,032
I got vamper juice
all over my good touring gloves.

129
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:33,960
If you have any kind of orders
to keep me alive,

130
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:36,137
you are about to fail.

131
00:12:36,684 --> 00:12:38,533
At the rate that you're draining me,

132
00:12:38,658 --> 00:12:39,708
I will die.

133
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:55,065
- Where do you come from?
- I didn't want anybody to see me,

134
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:58,279
so I parked around back.
Came in through your window.

135
00:13:00,064 --> 00:13:01,721
What the hell's going on here?

136
00:13:02,366 --> 00:13:03,416
How's Tara?

137
00:13:04,745 --> 00:13:05,992
She's a fucking mess,

138
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,516
that's how she is.

139
00:13:07,857 --> 00:13:09,496
Jesus fucking Christ.

140
00:13:10,138 --> 00:13:11,968
Don't you freak out on me.

141
00:13:12,169 --> 00:13:13,539
I killed a man.

142
00:13:13,664 --> 00:13:15,335
No, Stackhouse, I killed him.

143
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:19,813
That's what I told Bud, and that's
what both of us have to stick to

144
00:13:19,938 --> 00:13:22,346
because there's holes in our story.
Big gaping ones.

145
00:13:22,471 --> 00:13:25,582
- Like?
- If he was all up in my face,

146
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:28,890
then how come the gun that killed him
was fired from over 20 feet away?

147
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:30,450
Well, shit, man.

148
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:32,686
Why'd you tell him a story
with holes in it?

149
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,503
- We gotta go and tell him the truth.
- You tell anybody anything,

150
00:13:35,628 --> 00:13:38,123
we are both gonna spend
the rest of our lives in jail.

151
00:13:38,248 --> 00:13:40,931
- I don't want to go to jail.
- Then I need less conscience

152
00:13:41,056 --> 00:13:44,306
and a lot more <i>cojones</i>,
and I need to see them pronto.

153
00:13:46,044 --> 00:13:47,047
All right.

154
00:13:47,172 --> 00:13:48,172
Now listen.

155
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,604
Bud Dearborne's a good man,
he's a good cop,

156
00:13:50,729 --> 00:13:52,956
but he is tired and he is old
and he don't see the holes

157
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:54,160
like he used to.

158
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:55,709
We'll get through this

159
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,545
so long as we both act like
everything's perfectly normal.

160
00:14:00,252 --> 00:14:02,132
I ain't even sure
what normal is anymore.

161
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:04,593
For you, normal's going out
and getting tail,

162
00:14:04,761 --> 00:14:07,491
- so I suggest you start there.
- No, that's the old Jason.

163
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:09,014
I wanna be new Jason.

164
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:10,760
When this thing blows over,

165
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:12,779
you can go out and not get laid,

166
00:14:12,904 --> 00:14:16,689
but for now, you gotta be
the Jason Stackhouse everybody knows.

167
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,940
So conscience off, dick on,

168
00:14:19,307 --> 00:14:21,041
and everything's gonna be all right.

169
00:14:22,241 --> 00:14:24,216
- Fine.
- Say it with me.

170
00:14:24,739 --> 00:14:26,304
Conscience off.

171
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:27,741
Conscience off.

172
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,201
- Dick what?
- Dick on.

173
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,328
- And everything's...
- Gonna be all right.

174
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:36,790
All right, then.
That's more like it.

175
00:14:37,655 --> 00:14:39,905
I wasn't here tonight, Stackhouse.

176
00:14:53,813 --> 00:14:57,435
Now, I don't remember telling you
lavender was my favorite color.

177
00:14:57,939 --> 00:15:00,255
I'm in no mood
for lesbian weirdness tonight, Pam.

178
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,530
Where's Bill?

179
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,485
I have no idea.

180
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:07,703
- Then where's Eric?
- He's indisposed at the moment.

181
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,892
Indisposed doing what?

182
00:15:13,097 --> 00:15:15,147
Sookie, stop. Don't. Come back.

183
00:15:15,658 --> 00:15:17,508
I know he's in here.
Bill!

184
00:15:18,953 --> 00:15:20,043
Holy S.

185
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:27,421
See anything you like?

186
00:15:27,755 --> 00:15:28,844
I do.

187
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:31,763
I take it
Sookie couldn't be stopped.

188
00:15:32,749 --> 00:15:35,225
What can I say?
She overpowered me.

189
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:36,693
Off you go, Pam.

190
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:38,283
Fine.

191
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,986
Sookie, meet my new dancer,
Yvetta, from Estonia.

192
00:15:46,855 --> 00:15:48,355
Yvetta, meet Sookie,

193
00:15:48,787 --> 00:15:49,787
from here.

194
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:03,014
So,

195
00:16:03,567 --> 00:16:05,505
what brings you here
on this balmy summer night?

196
00:16:05,992 --> 00:16:07,841
Bill's been kidnapped,
and I think you did it.

197
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,134
I didn't.

198
00:16:10,131 --> 00:16:13,376
- Any other theories?
- I'm still on this one, thank you.

199
00:16:13,501 --> 00:16:16,600
- Where were you tonight around 11:00?
- Here, with Yvetta.

200
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:17,922
Doing this?

201
00:16:18,744 --> 00:16:20,020
For the last six hours?

202
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:22,563
You seem surprised.

203
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:25,900
Is Bill's stamina not up to snuff?

204
00:16:26,356 --> 00:16:29,404
Tell me where I can find Lorena.
If you don't have him,

205
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:30,470
she does.

206
00:16:30,595 --> 00:16:31,745
Solid theory,

207
00:16:32,846 --> 00:16:35,155
but given the tenor of your last run-in
with Miss Krasiki,

208
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:38,109
- It's better if I dealt with her.
- How do I know you will?

209
00:16:38,234 --> 00:16:41,748
Because if Bill was, in fact,
kidnapped, by human or vampire,

210
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,044
I am duty-bound as sheriff
of the area

211
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:46,114
in which he resides to find him.

212
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,058
Even if I do want what is his.

213
00:16:53,936 --> 00:16:54,936
Then do it.

214
00:16:57,742 --> 00:17:00,352
By the way, you owe me $10,000.

215
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:10,737
Run, dummy!
I feel so strong!

216
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:14,033
- Stop or you're gonna get yourself...
- Killed.

217
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:28,543
You feeling all floaty yet?

218
00:18:29,745 --> 00:18:30,659
Kind of.

219
00:18:30,969 --> 00:18:31,819
Good.

220
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,343
Tequila...

221
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:37,798
and Klonopin, baby girl.

222
00:18:38,061 --> 00:18:40,336
A steady diet of that,
and it'll keep them thoughts away

223
00:18:40,461 --> 00:18:42,961
till you is more equipped
to deal with them.

224
00:18:55,203 --> 00:18:56,663
It's Eggs.

225
00:18:57,614 --> 00:18:58,614
Come here.

226
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,254
What happened?

227
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:02,544
- They shot him.
- What? Who?

228
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,895
Said Eggs came at him with a knife

229
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:10,218
confessing to killing them women
and cutting out their hearts.

230
00:19:10,343 --> 00:19:12,316
The fuck he know any of that?

231
00:19:16,334 --> 00:19:18,534
Tara, he came to me earlier today,

232
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:21,826
said he needed help remembering
what Maryann made him do.

233
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:23,703
So...

234
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,872
So I helped him.

235
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,075
- You fucking did not.
- I'm sorry.

236
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,185
You're sorry. You signed his death
warrant and that's all you got?

237
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,171
Fuck you!

238
00:19:34,535 --> 00:19:36,382
Get off her! Get off her!

239
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,259
Stop it, Tara!

240
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:40,762
Is you crazy?

241
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,895
We're in the same boat!
Bill's gone too!

242
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,350
What the fuck? That's Sookie.

243
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:48,010
- She's your best friend.
- He didn't need to know!

244
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,145
Get out of here!

245
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,070
I was just fucking leaving.

246
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,661
- You remember our conversation?
- <i>Of course.</i>

247
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:00,448
I asked you to do one thing for me.

248
00:20:01,449 --> 00:20:03,049
Bring me Bill Compton.

249
00:20:03,946 --> 00:20:05,370
And you said, "Done. "

250
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,064
So why wasn't it done, Mr. Rubin?

251
00:20:08,189 --> 00:20:10,998
<i>I already told you, sheriff.
By the time we got to the restaurant,</i>

252
00:20:11,123 --> 00:20:13,090
<i>he was gone
and there was a cop car...</i>

253
00:20:13,215 --> 00:20:14,415
You failed me.

254
00:20:15,586 --> 00:20:17,882
How could you fail me?

255
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:22,529
Find him, Mr. Rubin,

256
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:26,026
or tomorrow's sunset
will be your last.

257
00:20:26,642 --> 00:20:28,468
<i>But sun-up's in a couple of minutes.</i>

258
00:20:28,593 --> 00:20:32,012
Then I recommend you find a day walker
you can trust to find him for you.

259
00:20:36,518 --> 00:20:38,418
- What?
- You're losing it.

260
00:20:40,137 --> 00:20:41,531
How is that helpful, Pam?

261
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:45,129
You need to call the queen.

262
00:20:45,254 --> 00:20:47,370
The queen is the last person
I need finding out.

263
00:20:47,642 --> 00:20:50,565
You're not the only one whose
fate hangs in the balance here.

264
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:52,826
And what will she do
if I tell her I've lost

265
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:56,581
the one vampire who could link her
to the dealing of vampire blood?

266
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,008
And that I have no idea where he is?

267
00:21:01,228 --> 00:21:04,137
And what do you think she'll do
if she finds out from someone else?

268
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:08,086
Call the queen.

269
00:21:09,341 --> 00:21:11,723
There are times
when I seek your counsel.

270
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:15,323
Now is not one of those times.

271
00:21:17,392 --> 00:21:19,542
Fine. I'm going to ground, then.

272
00:21:36,687 --> 00:21:38,564
Bill Compton. I need your help.

273
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,309
How'd you find me
all the way up here in Arkansas?

274
00:21:51,577 --> 00:21:54,228
You've had my blood, remember?
Quite a bit of it.

275
00:21:54,518 --> 00:21:55,368
Right.

276
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,529
Come on in.

277
00:22:09,621 --> 00:22:11,221
May I use your shower?

278
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:13,365
Of course.

279
00:22:16,961 --> 00:22:19,273
There's plenty of towels
in the bathroom.

280
00:22:20,075 --> 00:22:22,090
If you could spare a shirt,
I'd be much obliged.

281
00:22:22,349 --> 00:22:24,346
I really didn't pack anything.

282
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:27,470
It's kind of an impromptu
road trip I'm on.

283
00:22:29,703 --> 00:22:30,598
But...

284
00:22:31,182 --> 00:22:33,184
You could have the shirt off my back

285
00:22:33,634 --> 00:22:35,269
I'll take what I can get.

286
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,740
Right.

287
00:22:39,076 --> 00:22:39,899
Nice.

288
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:49,283
I'll take that shower now.

289
00:22:53,365 --> 00:22:55,315
Unless you'd care to join me.

290
00:23:00,915 --> 00:23:03,045
- I think I would.
- Good.

291
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:06,300
We're gonna have a nice time.

292
00:23:07,726 --> 00:23:10,078
I hear the water in Arkansas

293
00:23:10,969 --> 00:23:12,098
is very hard.

294
00:23:15,045 --> 00:23:15,895
Come.

295
00:23:17,377 --> 00:23:18,777
Don't answer that.

296
00:23:36,085 --> 00:23:38,185
<i>Am I speaking with Sam Merlotte?</i>

297
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,271
You can just call me Sam.

298
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:44,148
<i>This is Audrey Bishop
with the Magnolia Chamber of Commerce.</i>

299
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:46,073
<i>I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

300
00:23:47,336 --> 00:23:49,212
I'm really glad you did, Audrey.

301
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:51,929
<i>Regarding you inquiry
into Melinda and Joe Lee Mickens,</i>

302
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:55,372
<i>unfortunately, our records show
no current address on them.</i>

303
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:57,651
<i>But I can tell you</i> <i>they were evicted</i>

304
00:23:57,776 --> 00:24:00,462
<i>from their last residence
over three years ago.</i>

305
00:24:00,587 --> 00:24:01,737
Evicted, huh?

306
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:06,215
- So you reckon they've moved on, then?
- <i>I didn't say that.</i>

307
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:09,079
<i>I'm not supposed to give out
this kind of information,</i>

308
00:24:09,204 --> 00:24:11,804
- <i>but, you know, their boy?</i>
- Wait, wait.

309
00:24:12,906 --> 00:24:14,031
They have a son?

310
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:17,413
<i>He works over at Cornejo Tires
right off the 79.</i>

311
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:18,720
<i>Name's Tommy.</i>

312
00:24:18,845 --> 00:24:21,967
<i>A couple weeks ago,
I bought a set of new radials from him.</i>

313
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:24,420
<i>Turns out they were used,</i>

314
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,588
<i>as in bald as a baby's behind.</i>

315
00:24:27,207 --> 00:24:29,007
Thank you so much, Audrey.

316
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:32,845
Remind me never to mess
with the Magnolia Chamber of Commerce.

317
00:24:34,404 --> 00:24:36,170
If I know my mama,
she's probably out there

318
00:24:36,295 --> 00:24:39,623
telling that she did me a favor
by lying to me for all these years.

319
00:24:40,411 --> 00:24:41,961
I just feel betrayed.

320
00:24:42,528 --> 00:24:44,774
I don't know, Bubba.
I'm with Big Maxine on this one.

321
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:46,345
Take that back

322
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,945
or I'm gonna stick a branch up
your butt, prickly end first.

323
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,748
Weren't you happier before?

324
00:24:50,873 --> 00:24:53,116
When your daddy was shot
by a robber instead of by hisself?

325
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:54,334
Not really,

326
00:24:54,531 --> 00:24:57,244
because before I belonged to her
24/7, 365.

327
00:24:58,036 --> 00:24:59,580
But now... It's like they say,

328
00:24:59,749 --> 00:25:01,549
the truth has set me free.

329
00:25:03,978 --> 00:25:05,980
That sounds
like the same religious dog muck

330
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:08,543
Steve Newlin was trying
to sell me on.

331
00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:10,897
I'm starting to think the truth,

332
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:12,884
it's poison.

333
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:17,166
- You don't really believe that.
- Yes, I do.

334
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,209
People are always trying

335
00:25:19,334 --> 00:25:22,266
to fuck up other people's lives
by telling lies about them.

336
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:25,046
You want to really
fuck somebody's life up?

337
00:25:25,171 --> 00:25:26,971
Tell the truth about them.

338
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:29,944
They ain't never gonna be the same.

339
00:25:40,489 --> 00:25:43,206
Somebody must have told
the truth about me, then.

340
00:25:43,706 --> 00:25:46,377
My whole life's gone from happy to hell
inside just a couple days.

341
00:25:47,111 --> 00:25:49,546
I got no girlfriend,
I got no roof over my head,

342
00:25:49,671 --> 00:25:51,757
unless you count my car,
which is where I slept.

343
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:54,552
- I've been there.
- Good to know I got friends, though.

344
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,205
- Friends are good.
- Because I need a place to stay.

345
00:25:57,503 --> 00:25:58,598
I reckon you do.

346
00:26:02,121 --> 00:26:03,978
Can I crash at your place
for a little while?

347
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:05,807
Of course, man.

348
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:07,773
That's a nasty way to ask.

349
00:26:20,206 --> 00:26:21,256
How is she?

350
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:23,970
Sleeping finally.

351
00:26:24,246 --> 00:26:26,392
So keep it down.
I don't wanna wake her up.

352
00:26:27,122 --> 00:26:28,793
Thank you for calling me.

353
00:26:29,812 --> 00:26:31,195
This ain't about you and me

354
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,922
building a bridge
into our future together, all right?

355
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:35,968
You shot a gun at me.

356
00:26:36,939 --> 00:26:39,555
I don't even have the time.
I got two jobs,

357
00:26:39,914 --> 00:26:41,377
both of which I need,

358
00:26:41,502 --> 00:26:44,566
one of which I already
didn't even show up for today.

359
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,355
- Tara been asking for you nonstop...
- She has?

360
00:26:47,742 --> 00:26:50,399
Like a moth to flame.
Poor thing just want her mama.

361
00:26:51,128 --> 00:26:53,193
That's because she knows
in times of trouble,

362
00:26:53,318 --> 00:26:56,168
a mama's the only person
her baby can turn to.

363
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,631
Thank you, God,
for this opportunity to heal my baby.

364
00:26:58,756 --> 00:26:59,951
Please, none of that.

365
00:27:00,194 --> 00:27:02,233
Do everybody a solid
and instead of looking up

366
00:27:02,358 --> 00:27:04,163
at a God
that let all this shit happen,

367
00:27:04,288 --> 00:27:06,824
you need to keep your eyes
on your fucking daughter,

368
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,881
because she ain't right to be alone.

369
00:27:11,445 --> 00:27:12,338
I promise.

370
00:27:12,684 --> 00:27:13,632
Good.

371
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:17,727
I'll be back around midnight.

372
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,009
I'm late.

373
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:21,503
I'm sorry about shooting
your gun at you.

374
00:27:22,323 --> 00:27:23,323
Bitch,

375
00:27:24,339 --> 00:27:27,394
you-me bridge, it ain't gonna never
motherfucking happen.

376
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:36,025
I take it you heard
what happened last night with Bill.

377
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,400
Kenya told me.

378
00:27:37,525 --> 00:27:40,401
She also told me you got a hint
out of line with her.

379
00:27:40,526 --> 00:27:42,159
If anyone was out of line,
it was her.

380
00:27:42,715 --> 00:27:45,951
The man I'd be engaged to right now
if I'd gotten a chance to say yes

381
00:27:46,076 --> 00:27:47,400
was kidnapped last night,

382
00:27:47,525 --> 00:27:49,542
and she wouldn't even file
a missing persons report.

383
00:27:49,842 --> 00:27:51,320
How the hell could she,

384
00:27:51,445 --> 00:27:53,796
when the person that's missing
ain't even a real person?

385
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,950
Tell me you did not just say that,
because if you did,

386
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,303
I might have to forget that I was
brought up to respect my elders.

387
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:03,159
We are all supposed to respect
our elders,

388
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:05,981
and since Bill Compton's got
about a hundred years on you,

389
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:09,352
he deserves at least
a hint of your respect.

390
00:28:12,694 --> 00:28:14,144
There's... a woman.

391
00:28:14,435 --> 00:28:15,893
A vampire, actually.

392
00:28:16,018 --> 00:28:18,738
Her name's Lorena Krasiki,
and I think she's the one who took him.

393
00:28:19,089 --> 00:28:20,239
Help me to find her.

394
00:28:21,439 --> 00:28:23,489
You have to understand, Sookie.

395
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,829
I got dead bodies piling up on me.
Dead human bodies.

396
00:28:27,261 --> 00:28:30,272
So I can't be spending this
department's limited resources

397
00:28:30,397 --> 00:28:33,291
following up on hunches
about vampire nappings.

398
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:35,788
See, I don't think I should
have to understand that.

399
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:38,165
Because I love Bill
just like you love your wife

400
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,790
and your children
and your grandbabies.

401
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:44,638
So to my mind, that makes him
worth following up on.

402
00:29:07,105 --> 00:29:08,105
Excuse me.

403
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:13,334
- You Tommy?
- Congrats, bro. You can read.

404
00:29:14,357 --> 00:29:15,649
Tommy Mickens?

405
00:29:18,068 --> 00:29:19,173
Family name's Harmon.

406
00:29:23,336 --> 00:29:24,929
You're not Melinda
and Joe Lee's boy?

407
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,531
Because somebody told me
he's working here.

408
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:31,059
The Tommy you're looking for,
Tommy Mickens,

409
00:29:32,592 --> 00:29:34,737
He quit about six, seven months ago.

410
00:29:34,862 --> 00:29:37,126
Said he was leaving town.
Didn't say where to.

411
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,209
A real piece of shit if you ask me.

412
00:29:44,802 --> 00:29:47,905
From what I'm hearing,
pretty much all the Mickens are.

413
00:29:50,401 --> 00:29:52,929
Can't speak to that.
He's the only one I ever met.

414
00:29:54,823 --> 00:29:56,635
Sorry I couldn't be more help.

415
00:29:57,564 --> 00:29:58,764
Thanks anyway.

416
00:30:00,992 --> 00:30:02,692
You got some nice tires.

417
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:04,868
Maybe...

418
00:30:05,506 --> 00:30:08,055
I'll come back and get me some
on my way back out of town.

419
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,349
Give you good deal if you do.

420
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:12,699
I'll think about it.

421
00:30:14,371 --> 00:30:17,231
Name's Sam, by the way.
Sam Merlotte.

422
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:26,824
God works in mysterious ways,
Tara Mae.

423
00:30:28,869 --> 00:30:31,120
Keep talking to her, Reverend Daniels.
It's helping.

424
00:30:32,608 --> 00:30:34,758
And this devil woman came to you.

425
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:36,625
She introduced you to a man,

426
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,921
and together, they tried
to pull you down into the pits of hell.

427
00:30:41,317 --> 00:30:44,800
But all of it was part of God's plan
to lead you back to your mama.

428
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:49,279
And I'm so glad you're back.

429
00:30:50,943 --> 00:30:54,093
Ain't nobody ever gonna
get to you again, baby girl.

430
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:58,320
It's just you and me now.

431
00:31:44,594 --> 00:31:45,594
Fuck.

432
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,330
Didn't fucking work.

433
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:51,097
It stinks.

434
00:31:58,896 --> 00:32:00,417
Did you get my flowers?

435
00:32:03,397 --> 00:32:05,130
<i>I hope I didn't wake you.</i>

436
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,008
I miss you.

437
00:32:09,773 --> 00:32:11,744
- I miss you too.
- You do?

438
00:32:12,462 --> 00:32:14,431
That's great.
So when I can I see you again?

439
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,100
I got a haircut you'll like.

440
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:19,677
- This is just a really bad time.
- I think I look kind of badass.

441
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,567
Your Highness.
Magister.

442
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:08,120
Mr. Northman.

443
00:33:08,723 --> 00:33:11,279
I haven't seen you
since the Bill Compton trial.

444
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:13,532
Yes, it's been... too long.

445
00:33:15,788 --> 00:33:17,674
May I ask what brings you
to Fangtasia?

446
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:18,787
We need to talk.

447
00:33:20,353 --> 00:33:22,875
- You should probably close up.
- We can just use my office.

448
00:33:23,542 --> 00:33:24,642
It's bugged.

449
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:27,421
- How do you know this?
- I'm the one who bugged it.

450
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:31,436
It's how I know I can trust you.

451
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:34,314
All right,

452
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,380
everyone out now!

453
00:33:41,483 --> 00:33:43,312
Except she can stay.

454
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:48,192
No humans.

455
00:33:49,421 --> 00:33:52,154
I need both of you
at full attention.

456
00:33:56,496 --> 00:33:59,495
Trouble abounds in your fair state.

457
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:01,048
Tell me.

458
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:03,306
It would seem
your idyllic little home

459
00:34:03,431 --> 00:34:06,392
is competing to become
the V capital of the world.

460
00:34:06,708 --> 00:34:08,158
Can you believe it?

461
00:34:09,162 --> 00:34:10,339
I am so embarrassed.

462
00:34:10,912 --> 00:34:12,383
Naturally, I told the Magister

463
00:34:12,688 --> 00:34:16,011
that you were the only vampire
in my kingdom that could be trusted.

464
00:34:17,038 --> 00:34:18,677
Anything I can do to be of service.

465
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,350
Our blood is sacred.

466
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:23,945
Wasting it on anything
other than procreation

467
00:34:24,241 --> 00:34:25,187
is blasphemy.

468
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,704
- Madness.
- Desecration.

469
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:30,246
Have you noticed an uptick
in users in your neck of the woods?

470
00:34:30,371 --> 00:34:32,171
Maybe even here in your...

471
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:34,105
club?

472
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,364
I haven't, no.

473
00:34:36,245 --> 00:34:38,184
See, that's surprising to me,

474
00:34:38,309 --> 00:34:40,452
as every other sheriff
to whom I've spoken has.

475
00:34:41,214 --> 00:34:43,205
The amounts are so great, in fact,

476
00:34:43,374 --> 00:34:45,957
we can only assume
a vampire is responsible.

477
00:34:46,997 --> 00:34:49,559
An act of self-loathing so shameful

478
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:53,177
that whoever is responsible
should fall on his own stake.

479
00:34:55,813 --> 00:34:58,303
Respectfully, Magister,
I'm not sure I follow your logic.

480
00:34:59,626 --> 00:35:03,436
If your average run-of-the-mill
drainers were behind this,

481
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:06,167
it would stand to reason
said drainers would need

482
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:07,692
vampires to drain,

483
00:35:08,438 --> 00:35:10,601
which means there
would be missing vampires

484
00:35:10,726 --> 00:35:11,941
and plenty of them.

485
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:15,487
How many vampires have gone
missing in your area?

486
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:19,158
None, Magister.

487
00:35:19,691 --> 00:35:23,078
So now do you follow my logic?

488
00:35:23,594 --> 00:35:24,594
I do.

489
00:35:25,507 --> 00:35:27,217
And I will look into the matter.

490
00:35:27,507 --> 00:35:28,507
Good.

491
00:35:29,587 --> 00:35:31,387
And I will expect results.

492
00:35:32,166 --> 00:35:33,297
You will have them.

493
00:35:40,213 --> 00:35:43,033
- The chili is different tonight?
- Actually, yeah.

494
00:35:43,158 --> 00:35:46,185
It was tasting kind of flat,
so I put a pinch of cinnamon in it.

495
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,822
How the hell you smell that?

496
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:52,058
I put a half a teaspoon
in the whole pot.

497
00:35:53,763 --> 00:35:54,763
Shit.

498
00:35:55,450 --> 00:35:56,900
I'm pregnant again.

499
00:35:58,988 --> 00:36:01,325
- You forgot your rings.
- Fuck my rings.

500
00:36:04,741 --> 00:36:06,288
Hoyt, where you been, Bubba?

501
00:36:06,844 --> 00:36:07,944
Been crying.

502
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:11,627
Dude, shut up. I want you to meet
our new friends. Missy and Jen.

503
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,797
Recent graduates
of New York University,

504
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,270
currently driving across
the South out to California

505
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:20,093
where they're gonna start up
in veterinary school in the fall.

506
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:22,206
Ladies,

507
00:36:22,828 --> 00:36:24,640
this here is Hoyt Fortenberry.

508
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:28,020
He just moved out
of his mother's house.

509
00:36:28,145 --> 00:36:30,147
I like you.
You're like a big puppy.

510
00:36:30,272 --> 00:36:32,105
Oh, my God, you're so right.

511
00:36:32,415 --> 00:36:33,982
Sit down, pup.
Pour yourself a beer.

512
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:37,865
- I'm not really gonna stay...
- Sit down, pup.

513
00:36:40,699 --> 00:36:42,201
So veterinary school?

514
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,744
- With an emphasis in canine psychology.
- Like shrinks for dogs?

515
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:49,487
- Don't knock it.
- Yeah, don't. Don't knock it.

516
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:51,269
The thing is, is dogs' feelings

517
00:36:51,394 --> 00:36:53,717
and people's feelings aren't
really all that different,

518
00:36:53,842 --> 00:36:55,753
except theirs are harder
to figure out.

519
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:57,703
Because dogs can't talk.

520
00:36:58,748 --> 00:37:00,132
Exactly.

521
00:37:01,388 --> 00:37:03,841
See, if Hoyt here really were a dog,

522
00:37:04,177 --> 00:37:06,348
he wouldn't be able to tell us
why he's so sad right now.

523
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:08,725
Actually, it's because
my girlfriend and I...

524
00:37:11,432 --> 00:37:14,022
What kind of dog would you say I am?

525
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:17,860
- You're no puppy, that's for sure.
- You got that right, Missy.

526
00:37:18,532 --> 00:37:19,532
I'm Jen.

527
00:37:19,906 --> 00:37:22,119
- That's Missy.
- Yeah, I know.

528
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,535
I was looking at you,
but talking to her.

529
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,452
Something we do here in the South,

530
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:30,285
but if you don't wanna learn
about our culture, I'm...

531
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:33,041
- I'm happy to do it your way.
- You're a Lab.

532
00:37:33,346 --> 00:37:34,846
Correct. I am a Lab.

533
00:37:36,412 --> 00:37:38,362
But now for the hardest part.

534
00:37:40,175 --> 00:37:42,425
What am I thinking about right now?

535
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:44,577
You know, in my brain.

536
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,827
I bet you're wondering

537
00:37:48,587 --> 00:37:51,110
if you're gonna be able to get us
back to your place tonight,

538
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:52,644
and if so,

539
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,521
how out of control
are things gonna get?

540
00:37:57,751 --> 00:38:00,152
You girls are gonna make great vets.

541
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,703
What do you think?

542
00:38:05,828 --> 00:38:07,451
What the hell? I'm in.
Let's go.

543
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,368
Sweet.

544
00:38:08,966 --> 00:38:10,616
We'll follow you there.

545
00:38:12,537 --> 00:38:13,599
Yo, J.

546
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,910
You know,
I ain't all that comfortable with this.

547
00:38:16,035 --> 00:38:17,035
What?

548
00:38:18,078 --> 00:38:20,720
If we are gonna be roommates,
there's a certain amount of...

549
00:38:20,845 --> 00:38:23,599
pussy overflow you just have to get used
to dealing with.

550
00:38:23,724 --> 00:38:24,724
Come on.

551
00:38:28,338 --> 00:38:29,838
Attaboy, Stackhouse.

552
00:38:30,872 --> 00:38:34,552
When we do find
the vampire who's responsible,

553
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:37,411
- how will you punish him?
- Or her.

554
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:39,608
And will it be in public?

555
00:38:40,288 --> 00:38:42,560
Of course,
one who is proven guilty of such a crime

556
00:38:42,685 --> 00:38:44,535
must be made an example of.

557
00:38:45,474 --> 00:38:48,158
This kind of moral anarchy
cannot be allowed.

558
00:38:48,474 --> 00:38:49,474
Agreed.

559
00:38:50,108 --> 00:38:51,352
To a speedy resolution.

560
00:38:51,477 --> 00:38:53,288
- The speedier, the better.
- Magister.

561
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,172
Is it just me, or is he really dull?

562
00:39:04,922 --> 00:39:05,908
Your Highness.

563
00:39:06,033 --> 00:39:08,834
I mean,
isn't moral anarchy kind of the point?

564
00:39:08,959 --> 00:39:10,180
I can't think of anything

565
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,725
more depressing
than living by the law forever.

566
00:39:12,934 --> 00:39:13,910
Your Highness.

567
00:39:14,035 --> 00:39:15,035
Yes?

568
00:39:16,475 --> 00:39:19,888
Forgive me, but I don't feel
the same sense of relief you do.

569
00:39:20,013 --> 00:39:21,274
He doesn't believed us?

570
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:22,609
Not entirely, no.

571
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:26,896
Then I suggest
you sell everything you have

572
00:39:27,115 --> 00:39:28,975
- as soon as possible.
- Excuse me?

573
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,719
The pigs at the IRS
are breathing down my neck,

574
00:39:31,844 --> 00:39:33,245
and I need money now.

575
00:39:33,824 --> 00:39:35,601
Sell blood at half price
if you have to.

576
00:39:35,726 --> 00:39:37,351
I don't care what it takes.

577
00:39:37,476 --> 00:39:40,376
Just move the product
and then cover our tracks.

578
00:39:41,634 --> 00:39:43,527
All due respect, Your Highness,

579
00:39:43,652 --> 00:39:45,424
you're not considering
all the angles.

580
00:39:47,661 --> 00:39:50,148
All due respect, Mr. Northman,

581
00:39:50,674 --> 00:39:53,024
I'm due a lot more respect
than that.

582
00:39:53,662 --> 00:39:56,059
And I'm sorry to compromise
your manhood like this,

583
00:39:56,466 --> 00:39:59,466
but hell hath no fury
like a vampire queen broke.

584
00:40:00,662 --> 00:40:03,650
Move the blood.

585
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,830
I couldn't tell you this
in front of the Magister.

586
00:40:17,844 --> 00:40:19,572
Bill Compton has gone missing.

587
00:40:19,697 --> 00:40:20,876
Kidnapped, perhaps.

588
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:22,251
I don't care.

589
00:40:23,249 --> 00:40:26,214
- Move the blood.
- He is the one vampire that knows.

590
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,550
My side of it, at least.

591
00:40:28,718 --> 00:40:31,414
Then I don't understand why
we're even talking about him.

592
00:40:32,585 --> 00:40:33,685
Let him rot.

593
00:40:35,662 --> 00:40:36,850
I'll show myself out.

594
00:40:42,228 --> 00:40:44,287
Anything you can find out
is more than I got.

595
00:40:44,412 --> 00:40:45,971
All right, talk to you soon.

596
00:40:47,912 --> 00:40:48,912
May I?

597
00:40:50,286 --> 00:40:51,336
Come on in.

598
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,790
Now, why'd you have to go
and kill that Maenad?

599
00:40:58,915 --> 00:41:00,661
She's a terrific decorator.

600
00:41:00,786 --> 00:41:02,036
Any news about Bill?

601
00:41:02,752 --> 00:41:04,597
Just making my nightly rounds,

602
00:41:04,722 --> 00:41:07,422
and Eric wanted me to give you this.

603
00:41:09,356 --> 00:41:11,927
- It's too much. It's supposed to be 10.
- We know.

604
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:14,763
Eric wanted to give you a bonus
for going above and beyond.

605
00:41:14,975 --> 00:41:17,099
Well, tell him thanks, I guess.

606
00:41:17,726 --> 00:41:20,726
I'll say you sounded
more appreciative than that.

607
00:41:22,537 --> 00:41:23,662
What was that?

608
00:41:23,787 --> 00:41:25,437
It was Eric calling me.

609
00:41:25,562 --> 00:41:27,025
I should probably check in.

610
00:41:27,538 --> 00:41:28,838
He can call you?

611
00:41:40,451 --> 00:41:41,651
There you are.

612
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:48,241
You remember how we talked about
doing something after work tonight?

613
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,008
Are we still on or...?

614
00:41:52,996 --> 00:41:53,927
I don't know.

615
00:41:54,101 --> 00:41:55,956
I have to focus on my kids.

616
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,101
Peculiar.

617
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,400
A half-off sale on V.

618
00:42:02,894 --> 00:42:04,825
Even though part of the allure
of this shit

619
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,690
is how expensive and exotic it is.

620
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,038
Well, then sell it for twice the price.
We don't care.

621
00:42:10,163 --> 00:42:13,697
Just so long as it's all gone
by the time we wake up tomorrow evening.

622
00:42:14,127 --> 00:42:15,157
Tomorrow?

623
00:42:15,477 --> 00:42:17,409
- Is there a problem?
- No, hooker.

624
00:42:17,577 --> 00:42:20,820
Look, I can't sell all this shit
by tomorrow.

625
00:42:20,989 --> 00:42:22,330
I got a cousin in trouble.

626
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:23,932
She needs...

627
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:26,324
I don't know what it is about me

628
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:28,461
that makes people think
I want to hear you.

629
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:30,875
Maybe I smile too much.

630
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,849
Maybe I wear too much pink.

631
00:42:32,974 --> 00:42:34,176
But please remember,

632
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:36,664
I can rip your throat out
if I need to.

633
00:42:36,789 --> 00:42:39,786
And also know
that I am not a hooker.

634
00:42:40,287 --> 00:42:43,059
That was a long time, long time ago.

635
00:42:43,492 --> 00:42:44,478
All right.

636
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,772
You picking up
what I'm putting down?

637
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:48,690
I is.

638
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:49,850
Good.

639
00:42:49,975 --> 00:42:52,117
I'll be back tomorrow
to pick up the money.

640
00:43:21,025 --> 00:43:23,918
You might wanna start letting me know
when you're gonna be swinging by.

641
00:43:24,043 --> 00:43:26,231
- It'd be considered polite.
- Has Bill called you?

642
00:43:26,708 --> 00:43:29,356
- I told you I would tell you if he did.
- Not that kind of call.

643
00:43:29,794 --> 00:43:32,234
I was just with Pam
and she got all shivery,

644
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:35,628
and then she told me that Eric
had just called her and she had to go.

645
00:43:35,753 --> 00:43:37,781
- She was shivering?
- You ever felt that?

646
00:43:38,167 --> 00:43:39,167
Last night.

647
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:40,694
It came like a wave,

648
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:43,240
and it made me feel sick too,
like when I drank Kahlúa.

649
00:43:43,365 --> 00:43:45,038
This isn't about underaged drinking.

650
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:48,416
Bill is missing, and without your help,
he might never come back.

651
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,981
Now, other than sick,
what else did you feel?

652
00:43:51,106 --> 00:43:54,047
I don't know. Maybe...
Maybe I felt a place.

653
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,294
- What place? Where?
- I don't know.

654
00:43:56,419 --> 00:43:57,425
Come on.

655
00:43:58,105 --> 00:43:59,302
Where are we going?

656
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,939
You gotta find that place.

657
00:44:03,419 --> 00:44:05,183
And what the hell is that smell?

658
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,626
A possum died under the house.

659
00:44:10,108 --> 00:44:11,108
Come on.

660
00:44:40,691 --> 00:44:41,803
Stanley,

661
00:44:42,203 --> 00:44:43,930
is that you, my boy?

662
00:44:44,196 --> 00:44:47,183
Ma'am, my name is Bill Compton,
and I am badly in need of assistance.

663
00:44:48,881 --> 00:44:50,061
You're not my son?

664
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,520
No, I'm sorry.

665
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:53,690
And you look hungry.

666
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:56,321
I am.

667
00:44:57,319 --> 00:44:58,669
Well, come on in.

668
00:44:59,194 --> 00:45:00,864
I'll fix you something.

669
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:06,869
May I trouble you to use your phone?

670
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,371
I don't have one.

671
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:11,458
I had to choose between my oxygen

672
00:45:12,162 --> 00:45:13,850
and my phone,

673
00:45:14,566 --> 00:45:17,005
and since no one calls me anyhow,

674
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,190
I chose my oxygen.

675
00:45:21,247 --> 00:45:23,247
What can I get you to eat?

676
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,542
I don't know
if I can ever thank you enough

677
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:29,710
for what you done today,
Reverend Daniels,

678
00:45:29,835 --> 00:45:31,735
for my baby girl and for me.

679
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,628
You don't have to thank me.

680
00:45:33,753 --> 00:45:36,983
You're a part of my congregation,
and my congregation...

681
00:45:37,703 --> 00:45:39,084
is like my family.

682
00:45:39,444 --> 00:45:40,694
Still, can I...

683
00:45:48,131 --> 00:45:49,329
Like my family.

684
00:45:49,927 --> 00:45:51,227
You're so funny.

685
00:45:51,631 --> 00:45:53,931
I could conversate with you forever.

686
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,087
Can you thank you to the Reverend
for coming to see you?

687
00:45:57,384 --> 00:45:59,133
Thank you, Reverend Daniels.

688
00:45:59,258 --> 00:46:00,465
Thank you, Tara,

689
00:46:00,836 --> 00:46:03,636
for reminding me
of the healing power of God.

690
00:46:07,672 --> 00:46:09,599
I'm gonna go take shower, all right?

691
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,601
Of course, baby.
Wash it all away.

692
00:46:17,197 --> 00:46:19,401
Lettie Mae.
Do you think Tara could...?

693
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,180
- Mama.
- That you, boy?

694
00:47:23,086 --> 00:47:24,336
Where you been?

695
00:47:55,591 --> 00:47:56,414
That's it.

696
00:47:57,766 --> 00:48:00,627
Obviously, it's not. This thing
is softer than when I started.

697
00:48:02,161 --> 00:48:03,909
I'm sorry.
It's just...

698
00:48:04,597 --> 00:48:07,550
I mean, you're hot and all,
but this is so underwhelming.

699
00:48:09,284 --> 00:48:10,348
Let's just...

700
00:48:10,473 --> 00:48:12,473
Let's just power through this.

701
00:48:12,598 --> 00:48:14,349
How about I do you?

702
00:48:15,164 --> 00:48:16,164
All right.

703
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,441
Can I join you?

704
00:48:24,053 --> 00:48:26,819
Hoyt's so hung up on his ex
he won't even watch me play with myself.

705
00:48:27,513 --> 00:48:30,414
It's all right with me,
if it's all right with you.

706
00:48:31,017 --> 00:48:32,962
I can't believe
I'm doing this again.

707
00:48:48,289 --> 00:48:49,639
Did he already...

708
00:48:50,608 --> 00:48:51,808
Did you try...

709
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,849
This is what I've been dealing with
for the last half-hour.

710
00:48:58,442 --> 00:49:00,192
How about you two just...

711
00:49:00,999 --> 00:49:03,149
focus on each other for a minute.

712
00:49:05,032 --> 00:49:06,734
- He's weird.
- Whatever.

713
00:49:13,693 --> 00:49:15,851
- What's his problem?
- It's not you.

714
00:49:15,976 --> 00:49:16,869
It's just...

715
00:49:21,756 --> 00:49:23,551
Every time I look at you,

716
00:49:23,676 --> 00:49:27,380
I keep seeing these big old bullet holes
in your heads.

717
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:30,607
We're out of here.

718
00:49:34,447 --> 00:49:35,646
Y'all leaving?

719
00:49:35,771 --> 00:49:37,821
It was real nice meeting y'all.

720
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:45,917
Who are you?

721
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:48,819
That doesn't matter.

722
00:49:49,881 --> 00:49:51,946
- What's your name?
- Olivia.

723
00:49:52,506 --> 00:49:54,056
That's a lovely name.

724
00:49:55,693 --> 00:49:57,193
Now, listen, Olivia.

725
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:00,380
I was never here tonight.

726
00:50:02,192 --> 00:50:04,542
You will have no memory of me
or what I've done to you.

727
00:50:05,434 --> 00:50:06,753
What did you do to me?

728
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:08,068
Good girl.

729
00:50:10,069 --> 00:50:12,869
Now, before I go,
can you tell me where I am?

730
00:50:13,141 --> 00:50:14,456
In my house.

731
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,737
And what parish do you live in?

732
00:50:16,862 --> 00:50:19,188
I live in Copiah County.

733
00:50:20,256 --> 00:50:21,256
Mississippi?

734
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:29,966
I want you to have this.

735
00:50:31,904 --> 00:50:33,195
It's from Stanley.

736
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,770
He came to see you.

737
00:50:35,257 --> 00:50:36,257
He did?

738
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,338
He wanted you to have it to show you

739
00:50:39,463 --> 00:50:41,788
how much he appreciates
everything you have done.

740
00:50:42,755 --> 00:50:45,968
He's a good boy, my Stanley.

741
00:50:49,605 --> 00:50:50,880
I have to go now.

742
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,091
Goodbye, Olivia,

743
00:50:53,561 --> 00:50:54,676
and thank you.

744
00:51:08,514 --> 00:51:10,380
- Where Tara?
- In the shower.

745
00:51:10,505 --> 00:51:11,505
Alone?

746
00:51:12,005 --> 00:51:15,363
Reverend Daniels came over to talk.
Said she's gonna be just fine.

747
00:51:18,313 --> 00:51:19,867
Damn it, Tara. Open up!

748
00:51:20,035 --> 00:51:21,235
Open the door!

749
00:51:25,944 --> 00:51:27,894
We're getting close, I think.

750
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,818
I'm feeling nauseous,
like I got last night when Bill was...

751
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,030
That's Bill's car!

752
00:51:35,397 --> 00:51:37,707
I am a freak of fucking nature.

753
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:48,169
There's a body in here,
but it's not Bill.

754
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,772
Give me a hand!

755
00:51:52,881 --> 00:51:54,777
Check him for a wallet or phone,

756
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,239
anything that might tell us
who this fucker is.

757
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:00,366
No wallet.

758
00:52:02,894 --> 00:52:03,894
No phone.

759
00:52:12,189 --> 00:52:13,954
What is that?

760
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,123
Find it yet?

761
00:52:19,465 --> 00:52:22,192
- I found something that looks like it.
- What's it say it is?

762
00:52:22,317 --> 00:52:25,201
Well, it says it's got something to do
with Operation Werewolf.

763
00:52:27,256 --> 00:52:28,256
Werewolf?

764
00:52:48,005 --> 00:52:49,405
I should warn you.

765
00:52:50,828 --> 00:52:51,709
I've fed.
