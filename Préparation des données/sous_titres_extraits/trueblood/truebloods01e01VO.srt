1
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:24,111
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm bored.

2
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,487
You get bored pretty easily.

3
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:29,148
Only with you, darling.

4
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:39,376
Holy shit, V. Stop.

5
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,716
<i>We're citizens. We pay taxes.</i>

6
00:00:55,836 --> 00:00:57,948
<i>We deserve basic civil rights,
just like everyone else.</i>

7
00:00:58,068 --> 00:00:59,152
<i>But... Come on.</i>

8
00:00:59,272 --> 00:01:03,166
<i>Doesn't your race have
a rather sordid history or exploiting</i>

9
00:01:03,286 --> 00:01:05,402
<i>and feeding off innocent people?</i>

10
00:01:05,562 --> 00:01:07,592
<i>- For centuries?
- Three points:</i>

11
00:01:07,905 --> 00:01:10,192
<i>Number one, show me documentation.</i>

12
00:01:10,469 --> 00:01:11,533
<i>It doesn't exist.</i>

13
00:01:12,256 --> 00:01:15,963
<i>Number two, doesn't your race
have a history of exploitation?</i>

14
00:01:16,384 --> 00:01:20,250
<i>We never owned slaves, Bill,
or detonated nuclear weapons.</i>

15
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:22,168
<i>And most importantly,
point number three,</i>

16
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:24,554
<i>now that the Japanese
have perfected synthetic blood</i>

17
00:01:24,674 --> 00:01:26,447
<i>which satisfies {\all of }our nutritional needs,</i>

18
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:29,300
<i>there is no reason
for anyone to fear us.</i>

19
00:01:29,883 --> 00:01:32,679
<i>I can assure you
that every member of our community</i>

20
00:01:32,839 --> 00:01:34,751
<i>is now drinking synthetic blood.</i>

21
00:01:34,871 --> 00:01:37,038
<i>That's why we decided
to make our existence known.</i>

22
00:01:37,158 --> 00:01:39,337
<i>We just wanna be
part of mainstream society.</i>

23
00:01:49,144 --> 00:01:49,842
Hi.

24
00:01:50,684 --> 00:01:52,454
Y'all have Tru Blood.

25
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,711
For real.

26
00:01:54,749 --> 00:01:56,013
You get vamps in here?

27
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,954
I didn't even think
we had any in Louisiana.

28
00:01:58,114 --> 00:01:59,287
You didn't know

29
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:01,369
that New Orleans

30
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:04,461
- is a Mecca for the vampire?
- Seriously?

31
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:05,991
I mean, New Orleans?

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,548
Even after Katrina?
Didn't they all drown?

33
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:10,553
Vampires cannot drown.

34
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:13,386
Because we do not breathe.

35
00:02:17,025 --> 00:02:17,832
Dude,

36
00:02:18,084 --> 00:02:19,309
no harm intended.

37
00:02:21,749 --> 00:02:24,022
- We're just a little drunk.
- Nice.

38
00:02:24,289 --> 00:02:26,191
I could use a cocktail.

39
00:02:32,784 --> 00:02:33,626
Score.

40
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:35,552
I totally had you guys.

41
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:39,536
- That wasn't funny.
- Yeah, it was

42
00:02:39,697 --> 00:02:41,660
No, Kelly, that was pretty funny.

43
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:44,007
- I didn't think it was funny.
- What?

44
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:45,710
We don't care what you think.

45
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:49,718
Dude, you know
where we can score any V-juice?

46
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:51,132
Gross. Brad, no.

47
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:53,510
- How much you need?
- I knew a girl who knew this girl,

48
00:02:53,671 --> 00:02:55,673
who did vamp blood during Greek Week.

49
00:02:55,793 --> 00:02:57,815
She, like, clawed her own face off.

50
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,499
Seriously, I can pay good money.

51
00:03:02,521 --> 00:03:04,312
You two need to leave.

52
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:06,481
All right. Fuck you, Billy Bob.

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,959
Fuck me?

54
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:10,902
I'll fuck you, boy.

55
00:03:11,184 --> 00:03:14,073
I'll fuck you, and then I'll eat you.

56
00:03:35,559 --> 00:03:38,450
You ever pretend to be
one of us again,

57
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:41,901
and I'll kill you

58
00:03:43,336 --> 00:03:44,191
Got it?

59
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:49,854
Have a nice day, now.

Although I kind of enjoyed it.</i>

<i>I cannot wait to get the hell out
of this Podunk town.</i>

76
00:06:09,815 --> 00:06:11,624
Make sure you do,
and before it's too late,

77
00:06:11,784 --> 00:06:14,544
because every year you wait,
you just get more and more stuck here.

78
00:06:14,704 --> 00:06:17,449
- Believe me, I know.
<i>- How'd she know what I was thinking?</i>

79
00:06:17,726 --> 00:06:20,223
<i>That's weird.
Did she hear my thoughts?</i>

80
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,814
I'll get y'all some ketchup.

81
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:50,945
Welcome to Super Sav-A-Bunch.

82
00:06:51,065 --> 00:06:54,823
Hi. I'm looking for that thick,
translucent plastic sheeting.

83
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:58,753
The kind they hang in front of the doors
of walk-in refrigerators.

84
00:06:58,873 --> 00:07:01,924
We don't sell that here.
You could try Home Depot.

85
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,844
I tried them already.
They sent me here.

86
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:07,972
Now, I cannot believe
you don't have that stuff.

87
00:07:08,186 --> 00:07:09,974
I don't even know what it's called.

88
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:10,970
Sorry.

89
00:07:11,844 --> 00:07:15,384
- You're supposed to have everything.
- Well, we don't have that stuff,

90
00:07:15,613 --> 00:07:17,599
that you don't even know
what it's called.

91
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,607
Your website says that this is the most
well-stocked store in five parishes.

92
00:07:21,727 --> 00:07:24,670
Now, I just drove over an hour
from Marthaville.

93
00:07:25,925 --> 00:07:28,609
Does our website have a phone number?

94
00:07:28,925 --> 00:07:31,609
- Well, I suppose it does, but...
- So it never occurred to you,

95
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:34,404
before you drove an hour,
to pick up the phone and call us,

96
00:07:34,524 --> 00:07:36,793
to see if we stocked {\whatever the hell it is that}
what you're looking for?

97
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:40,046
Well, I think that if a business
chooses to classify itself as

98
00:07:40,206 --> 00:07:43,537
Why didn't you just find it online
and have it delivered to your house?

99
00:07:43,657 --> 00:07:46,969
Or were you just looking for an excuse
to wear them ugly-ass clothes?

100
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,054
I would like to speak to your manager.

101
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,748
Fine.

102
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:06,065
Trust me, you are not gettin' me fired.
I am quittin'.

103
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,659
You were just the fuckin' catalyst,
and for that, I ought to thank you.

104
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,209
- You are a very rude young woman.
- Oh, this ain't rude.

105
00:08:13,756 --> 00:08:15,044
This is uppity.

106
00:08:16,534 --> 00:08:18,292
That's for pattin' my ass too much.

107
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:21,003
I'm a get my baby daddy,
who just got out of prison,

108
00:08:21,163 --> 00:08:24,248
- to come and kick your teeth in.
- Jesus, Tara. Please don't do any...

109
00:08:24,368 --> 00:08:25,584
Oh, my God.

110
00:08:25,902 --> 00:08:28,478
I'm not serious, you pathetic racist.

111
00:08:28,755 --> 00:08:30,368
I don't have a baby.

112
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:32,348
Damn.

113
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:36,160
I know y'all have to be stupid,
but do you have to be that stupid?

114
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:38,345
Shit. Fuck this job.

115
00:08:43,129 --> 00:08:44,369
Evening. Merlotte's.

116
00:08:45,997 --> 00:08:47,044
Hey, Tara.

117
00:08:47,962 --> 00:08:49,623
Yeah, she's right here.

118
00:08:50,769 --> 00:08:53,501
I'm so sorry, Sam.
She knows not to call me at work.

119
00:08:53,621 --> 00:08:56,831
Sookie, it's okay. You don't abuse
a privilege like Arlene does.

120
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,876
- I heard that.
- Well, I wish you would hear that.

121
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:01,885
Please. Sam, I have kids.

122
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:04,130
This had better be an emergency.

123
00:09:04,792 --> 00:09:06,368
I just quit my job.

124
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:07,367
<i>Again?</i>

125
00:09:07,644 --> 00:09:09,135
I can't work for assholes.

126
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:12,447
I'm glad you can afford to be so picky,
Miss Say-Hello-To-The-Rest-Of-Us.

127
00:09:12,567 --> 00:09:13,347
<i>Shut up.</i>

128
00:09:13,715 --> 00:09:16,100
Sam is not an asshole
and he's totally in love with you.

129
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,169
Tara, he is my boss.

130
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:22,171
Jesus. Look, you need to lighten up.

131
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,746
You know I hate it
when you use the J word.

132
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:25,860
Now, I gotta go.

133
00:09:26,907 --> 00:09:29,254
I'm coming over. I need a margarita.

134
00:09:29,555 --> 00:09:30,518
A big one.

135
00:09:30,722 --> 00:09:31,432
Bye.

136
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:39,881
Mack and Denise Rattray are just about
to sit down in your section.

137
00:09:42,436 --> 00:09:43,580
What the fuck?

138
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,809
Don't let 'em get to you, <i>chère</i>.

139
00:09:49,146 --> 00:09:50,374
They're not worth it.

140
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:54,388
Two Tecates.

141
00:09:54,549 --> 00:09:57,770
<i>Hell, there ain't nothing on this menu
ain't gonna give me the runs.</i>

142
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:00,250
Damn son of a...

143
00:10:01,146 --> 00:10:03,902
- What can I do for y'all tonight?
<i>- You can wrap your sweet lips</i>

144
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:06,445
<i>around my slim reaper,
that's what you can do.</i>

145
00:10:06,565 --> 00:10:09,358
Why don't we just start out
with a pitcher of Bud?

146
00:10:09,478 --> 00:10:11,948
You can hop aboard the Mack express

147
00:10:12,108 --> 00:10:14,485
- and ride all the way to heaven.
- Alrighty.

148
00:10:14,605 --> 00:10:16,670
- Anything else?
<i>- What the hell is wrong with her?</i>

149
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,288
<i>She's pathetic like a dog
that's been kicked too many times,</i>

150
00:10:19,448 --> 00:10:22,041
<i>- and keeps coming back for more.</i>
- Coming right up.

151
00:10:26,997 --> 00:10:28,422
I think she's retarded.

152
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:32,275
Honey, if Rene tells you you're
too young to watch a scary movie on HBO,

153
00:10:32,395 --> 00:10:33,996
then I'm siding with him.

154
00:10:36,156 --> 00:10:37,492
I know he's not your daddy,

155
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:40,935
but your daddy does not wanna live
with us anymore. Remember?

156
00:10:48,809 --> 00:10:50,003
Onion rings.

157
00:10:50,123 --> 00:10:52,697
And if you drop a few of them
on the floor, that's fine with me.

158
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:53,831
Got it.

159
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,977
Sookie. Chicka-chicka-bow-wow.

160
00:10:59,447 --> 00:11:01,603
You're lookin' like a porn star
with that tan.

161
00:11:01,723 --> 00:11:03,264
And pink lipstick.

162
00:11:04,016 --> 00:11:04,959
You got a date?

163
00:11:05,119 --> 00:11:07,795
No. When I wear makeup,
I get bigger tips.

164
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,124
Yes, girl, that's it.

165
00:11:11,244 --> 00:11:13,723
These damn rednecks
are suckers for packaging.

166
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:17,665
And I get even bigger tips when I act
like I don't have a brain in my head.

167
00:11:17,785 --> 00:11:19,964
But, if I don't,
they're all scared of me.

168
00:11:20,084 --> 00:11:22,648
They ain't scared of you, honey child.

169
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:25,062
They scared
of what's between your legs.

170
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,920
Lafayette. That's nasty talk.
I won't listen to that.

171
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,694
Do you even know
what's between a woman's legs?

172
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:33,812
I know every man,
whether straight, gay,

173
00:11:33,932 --> 00:11:37,783
or George ma-fuckin' Bush
is terrified of the pussy.

174
00:11:39,186 --> 00:11:40,955
- What are we talking about?
- Pussy.

175
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,474
Listen, not everybody is gay, okay?

176
00:11:43,594 --> 00:11:45,712
Not everybody wants
to have sex with you.

177
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:48,502
You would be surprised, Arlene.
People you know.

178
00:11:50,861 --> 00:11:52,269
That's all I'm saying.

179
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:54,496
- I don't wanna have sex with you.
- Me neither.

180
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:57,059
Shit. Y'all bitches don't know
what you're missin'.

181
00:11:57,179 --> 00:11:59,376
I got six gears on these hips.

182
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:01,784
No, baby.
You don't know what you're missing.

183
00:12:01,904 --> 00:12:04,134
You can watch her walk away.
Make you wanna slap it?

184
00:12:04,254 --> 00:12:06,276
- You wanna slap it?
- Everybody knows that.

185
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:08,814
Everybody been there. Ain't that right?
John's been there.

186
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,400
Take these, baby. Peaches and cream.

187
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,903
I'll give you a little cocoa.
Little cocoa.

188
00:12:14,063 --> 00:12:16,238
Ain't that right, John? Shit.

189
00:12:17,006 --> 00:12:20,027
<i>Look, I'm a pretty nice guy, but I have,
like, a little bit of an edge to me.</i>

190
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,244
<i>Got started at a young age.</i>

191
00:12:22,404 --> 00:12:24,337
<i>Started getting into fights...</i>

192
00:12:24,457 --> 00:12:26,748
<i>- Really?
- Used to get into a lot of trouble.</i>

193
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,335
Got kicked out of a couple schools,
type of thing.

194
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:32,458
Partying in high school.

195
00:12:50,424 --> 00:12:51,913
What the fuck is this?

196
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,211
It's... just, a

197
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,352
mosquito bite.

198
00:12:59,285 --> 00:13:01,117
You had sex with a vampire?

199
00:13:03,847 --> 00:13:04,578
Once.

200
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:08,755
I went to that vampire bar,
down in Shreveport.

201
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:11,908
Look. I was broke

202
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:14,797
and he paid me a lot of money.

203
00:13:21,751 --> 00:13:23,222
You a hooker, Maudette?

204
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:26,183
Because I don't pay for it.
Never have, never will.

205
00:13:26,538 --> 00:13:28,789
I don't charge for it, neither.

206
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,485
I mean, he offered me
a thousand dollars to bite me.

207
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:34,316
What was I gonna do?
Say no to a thousand bucks?

208
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:39,200
What was it like?

209
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,116
Scary.

210
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,864
You know, I read in Hustler

211
00:13:47,336 --> 00:13:50,332
everybody should have sex with a vampire
at least once before they die.

212
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:53,258
Once was enough for me.

213
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:55,030
He was way too rough.

214
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,426
I mean, I like to be rough

215
00:13:57,751 --> 00:13:58,858
sometimes.

216
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:00,988
- But...
- You like it rough?

217
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:04,307
Why not?

218
00:14:05,631 --> 00:14:07,750
You know, it's not like
it's gonna kill me.

219
00:14:08,189 --> 00:14:09,874
And if it does, well, then

220
00:14:10,404 --> 00:14:12,293
I won't care, will I?

221
00:14:22,316 --> 00:14:23,339
Right. Well...

222
00:14:26,384 --> 00:14:27,953
I videotaped it.

223
00:14:30,019 --> 00:14:30,664
What?

224
00:14:31,427 --> 00:14:32,991
With the vampire.

225
00:14:38,781 --> 00:14:40,309
You wanna watch?

226
00:14:48,425 --> 00:14:49,953
My life sucks.

227
00:14:50,073 --> 00:14:52,102
Tara, don't you be feeling sorry
for yourself.

228
00:14:52,523 --> 00:14:54,605
- That's just lazy.
- Why can't I keep a job?

229
00:14:54,765 --> 00:14:56,649
Maybe because you can't keep
your mouth shut.

230
00:14:56,809 --> 00:14:58,385
Bitch, who asked you?

231
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,481
How you doing?

232
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,099
I've had better nights.

233
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:07,758
Anything I can do
to improve this one for you?

234
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:48,867
Oh, my God.

235
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,579
I think Merlotte's just got
its first vampire.

236
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:53,455
I think you're right.

237
00:15:53,615 --> 00:15:56,444
Can you believe it?
Right here, in Benton?

238
00:15:57,097 --> 00:15:58,364
I've been waing for this{\to happen}

239
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:01,069
since they came out
of the coffin two years ago.

240
00:16:08,105 --> 00:16:10,464
Hi, and what... What can I get
for you tonight?

241
00:16:12,122 --> 00:16:15,251
Do you have any
of that synthetic bottled blood?

242
00:16:17,412 --> 00:16:20,818
No, I'm so sorry.
Sam got some a year ago, but

243
00:16:21,035 --> 00:16:23,152
nobody ever ordered it,
so it went bad.

244
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,218
You're our first.

245
00:16:28,398 --> 00:16:29,252
Vampire.

246
00:16:32,129 --> 00:16:33,610
Am I that obvious?

247
00:16:33,856 --> 00:16:35,372
I knew the minute you came in.

248
00:16:35,951 --> 00:16:37,958
I can't believe nobody else
around here seems to.

249
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,084
He does.

250
00:16:42,372 --> 00:16:43,756
Don't worry about, he's cool.

251
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,342
I know for a fact he supports
the Vampire Rights Amendment.

252
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,272
How progressive of him.

253
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,120
Anything else you drink?

254
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:02,330
Actually, no.

255
00:17:05,159 --> 00:17:08,947
But you can get me a glass of red wine
so I have a reason to be here.

256
00:17:13,401 --> 00:17:15,062
Whatever the reason...

257
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:18,408
I'm glad you are.

258
00:17:20,451 --> 00:17:22,605
Don't mind Sookie none, mister.

259
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,181
She's crazy as a bedbug.

260
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:28,262
I'll just get your wine for you.

261
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,050
My name's Mack Rattray

262
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:39,612
and this here's my wife, Denise.

263
00:17:40,738 --> 00:17:41,592
Hello.

264
00:17:44,704 --> 00:17:45,811
Good evening.

265
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:39,796
What a bitch.

266
00:18:40,849 --> 00:18:44,063
You really think
that she's gonna let him bite her?

267
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:47,761
You know how many people
are having sex with vampires these days?

268
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:50,336
And sometimes those people disappear.

269
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:54,928
- He's not like that.
- You spoke to him for, like, a minute.

270
00:18:55,088 --> 00:18:57,119
You ignore how many people
he sucked the blood out

271
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:59,701
over the last however many centuries
he's been alive.

272
00:18:59,821 --> 00:19:03,459
- But he's so not scary.
- Sweet Jesus, he is a vampire.

273
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,553
Yeah, but the synthetic blood
has everything...

274
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:08,129
Are you willing to pass up
all your favorite foods

275
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:10,681
and spend the rest of your life
drinking Slim-Fast?

276
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:17,075
I mean, people have always
discriminated against me.

277
00:19:17,235 --> 00:19:19,161
Oh, boy, have they ever.

278
00:19:19,321 --> 00:19:23,308
And just because I never felt like being
what society wanted me to be,

279
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,284
- you know?
- Me neither.

280
00:19:25,651 --> 00:19:26,638
Me neither.

281
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:29,804
So we know what it's been
like for you.

282
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:35,969
Can I get y'all anything else?

283
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:38,972
<i>He's probably got 11
or 12 pints in him.</i>

284
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:41,768
<i>Holy shit, that's almost 200 ounces.</i>

285
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:45,562
<i>I bet we could get 500 an ounce
in Dallas. Fuck me, that's $10,000.</i>

286
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:46,649
<i>Sweet Jesus.</i>

287
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,649
I'm gonna bring y'all
a free round of beer.

288
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:51,072
<i>What the hell is your problem,
dimwitted...</i>

289
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,445
- Don't you go anywhere.
<i>- I guess you are retarded.</i>

290
00:19:53,605 --> 00:19:55,790
<i>Just like everybody says you are.</i>

291
00:19:59,816 --> 00:20:01,682
- We have to stop them.
- Stop who? Why?

292
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:04,119
The Rattrays. They're gonna drain him
and sell his blood.

293
00:20:04,239 --> 00:20:06,069
- We have to stop them.
- No, we do not.

294
00:20:06,189 --> 00:20:08,126
We don't have to get
anywhere near that vampire.

295
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:12,190
I am very disappointed in you
and your small-mindedness.

296
00:20:13,411 --> 00:20:15,927
The vampire can take care of himself.
I promise you.

297
00:20:18,822 --> 00:20:19,700
Shit.

298
00:20:22,217 --> 00:20:24,226
- Tara, you know how to tend bar?
- No.

299
00:20:24,722 --> 00:20:25,712
Fake it.

300
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:27,646
Shit.

301
00:20:38,795 --> 00:20:40,938
<i>Look at this. This is so thick.</i>

302
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:42,900
Damn, this is gonna bring
a pretty penny.

303
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,675
We should keep some for ourselves.

304
00:20:44,795 --> 00:20:47,720
If Mack freaks out on me again,
I am so through with him.

305
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,548
You like this?

306
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:18,989
Being punished?

307
00:21:21,595 --> 00:21:24,740
You're a sick little vampire fucker.

308
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,320
You like that, Pickens?

309
00:21:29,141 --> 00:21:30,149
Come on.

310
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:32,783
You look at me.

311
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:36,904
- You let a dead man fuck you?
- Yeah.

312
00:21:37,313 --> 00:21:38,649
Fuckin' disgust me.

313
00:21:42,055 --> 00:21:44,056
It's too bad I don't have fangs, huh?

314
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:46,340
Rip your fuckin' throat out.

315
00:21:59,899 --> 00:22:00,681
Hurry.

316
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:04,183
- We should've taken him home.
- Too dangerous.

317
00:22:04,303 --> 00:22:06,495
Where are we gonna hide
a dead vampire in our trailer?

318
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:09,599
Well, at least we wouldn't be out
in the fuckin' open like this.

319
00:22:10,592 --> 00:22:12,566
I just need some V-juice.
I need it bad.

320
00:22:12,686 --> 00:22:15,370
My body is starting to hurt
and I just need to get it in me.

321
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:18,173
Goddamn it, Mack, you're a fuckin'
drug addict, do you know that?

322
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:21,418
Woman, would you
just shut the fuck up?

323
00:22:21,737 --> 00:22:24,951
Sometimes, when you talk,
this is what I hear:

324
00:22:25,215 --> 00:22:26,974
A-yada-yada-yada...

325
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,522
You crazy bitch.

326
00:22:49,688 --> 00:22:51,540
This ain't your business,
you stupid cunt.

327
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:55,293
Now, see, that just proves
how low-rent you really are.

328
00:22:56,365 --> 00:22:58,977
You have any idea
who you're messing with?

329
00:23:00,536 --> 00:23:02,634
You don't wanna be on my bad side.

330
00:23:02,794 --> 00:23:05,302
I'm not so sure you
even have another side,

331
00:23:05,422 --> 00:23:07,806
you no-account, backwoods trash.

332
00:23:15,182 --> 00:23:17,868
Do not even think about
taking that blood.

333
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,857
I will kill you for this.

334
00:23:24,055 --> 00:23:24,994
Get out.

335
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:26,222
Now.

336
00:23:28,352 --> 00:23:29,411
Come on, Mac.

337
00:23:34,063 --> 00:23:35,447
This ain't over. Come on.

338
00:23:38,475 --> 00:23:39,534
Get up, Mack.

339
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:41,845
Why can't you take
that fuckin' thing off?

340
00:23:42,097 --> 00:23:44,050
I ain't got time
for a fuckin' cripple,

341
00:23:44,212 --> 00:23:46,502
because I'm getting out of here
one way or the other.

342
00:23:46,622 --> 00:23:48,247
You... how else am I gonna...

343
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,488
Shut up.

344
00:24:23,842 --> 00:24:26,442
- Quick, with your feet.
- I'm gonna get you, bitch!

345
00:24:32,057 --> 00:24:33,391
Oh, bless your heart.

346
00:24:34,236 --> 00:24:37,148
I am so sorry
I didn't get here faster.

347
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,224
You'll be okay in a minute, right?

348
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:46,079
- Do you want me to leave?
- No.

349
00:24:48,577 --> 00:24:50,575
They might come back
and I can't fight yet.

350
00:24:55,546 --> 00:24:57,040
Hey, there, dog.

351
00:25:09,167 --> 00:25:10,516
He's checkin' on you.

352
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:13,825
That's just some old dog
that hangs around the bar sometime.

353
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,475
He must live nearby.

354
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:18,068
Well, no doubt.

355
00:25:24,474 --> 00:25:27,529
I reckon you're not too happy
about being rescued by a woman.

356
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,449
Thank you.

357
00:25:46,424 --> 00:25:48,008
I can't hear you.

358
00:25:49,584 --> 00:25:50,510
Thank you.

359
00:25:50,825 --> 00:25:53,289
No, no, no.
I can hear you, but I can't...

360
00:25:59,661 --> 00:26:01,673
Oh, my stars.

361
00:26:04,287 --> 00:26:07,541
Aren't you afraid to be out here alone
with a hungry vampire?

362
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:14,402
Vampires often turn on those
who trust them, you know.

363
00:26:15,587 --> 00:26:18,496
We don't have human values like you.

364
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:21,791
A lot of humans turn on those
who trust them too.

365
00:26:25,170 --> 00:26:26,824
I'm not a total fool.

366
00:26:28,693 --> 00:26:31,239
But you have other
very juicy arteries.

367
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:38,308
There's one in the groin
that's a particular favorite of mine.

368
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:40,055
Just shut your nasty mouth, mister.

369
00:26:40,175 --> 00:26:42,280
You might be a vampire,
but when you talk to me,

370
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,481
you will talk to me
like the lady that I am.

371
00:26:54,455 --> 00:26:57,018
You wanna drink the blood
they collected?

372
00:26:57,957 --> 00:27:00,629
I understand it makes humans
feel more healthy.

373
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:04,501
Improves their sex life.

374
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,485
I'm as healthy as a horse.

375
00:27:06,605 --> 00:27:09,047
And I have no sex life
to speak of, so...

376
00:27:12,524 --> 00:27:14,305
You can just keep it.

377
00:27:18,984 --> 00:27:20,308
You could always sell it.

378
00:27:21,716 --> 00:27:23,191
I wouldn't touch it.

379
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,573
What are you?

380
00:27:41,429 --> 00:27:43,090
I'm... I'm Sookie Stackhouse

381
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:45,786
and I'm a waitress.

382
00:27:50,359 --> 00:27:51,719
What's your name?

383
00:28:05,149 --> 00:28:08,675
I thought it might be Antoine
or Basil or...

384
00:28:09,635 --> 00:28:12,885
Or, heh... Or, like, Langford, maybe.

385
00:28:14,937 --> 00:28:16,724
Vampire Bill.

386
00:28:17,585 --> 00:28:18,367
Oh, my.

387
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:25,141
So...

388
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,078
Silver, huh?

389
00:28:29,245 --> 00:28:30,962
I thought that only affected
werewolves.

390
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,779
I... I... I'm not implying
that werewolves exist.

391
00:28:35,668 --> 00:28:37,968
I mean, that's just
what you always see in the movies.

392
00:28:38,167 --> 00:28:41,073
I'd appreciate it if you didn't share
this information with anyone.

393
00:28:43,523 --> 00:28:46,387
We don't like for our weaknesses
to be made public knowledge.

394
00:29:04,065 --> 00:29:05,101
See ya, Bill.

395
00:29:06,731 --> 00:29:08,164
I gotta get back to work.

396
00:29:27,993 --> 00:29:28,956
Thank God.

397
00:29:33,587 --> 00:29:35,633
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

398
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:37,764
And, for your information,

399
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:40,712
not all vampires
can take care of themselves.

400
00:29:58,165 --> 00:30:00,135
- Night, Sam.
- Night.

401
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:01,282
Night.

402
00:30:05,477 --> 00:30:07,114
Thanks for helping me out tonight.

403
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:10,231
How much you gonna pay me?

404
00:30:12,864 --> 00:30:13,694
20 bucks?

405
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:17,161
How do you expect me to work here
for 20 bucks a night?

406
00:30:17,281 --> 00:30:20,031
I don't expect you to work here.
You only covered tonight

407
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,633
- for what, an hour at the most?
- Yeah, but Sam. If I did work here

408
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:26,280
It'd be a matter of time before you
went off on somebody.

409
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,746
I don't wanna drive
my customers away.

410
00:30:28,907 --> 00:30:30,415
I only go off on stupid people.

411
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:32,542
Most of my customers are stupid people.

412
00:30:33,453 --> 00:30:34,512
Yeah, but...

413
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:37,347
I could help you keep
an eye on Sookie.

414
00:30:37,853 --> 00:30:40,128
You see the way
she was looking at that vampire?

415
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:42,844
That is just trouble looking
for a place to happen.

416
00:30:43,446 --> 00:30:46,648
And she means too much to both of us
to let anything happen to her.

417
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,688
Be here tomorrow at 6.

418
00:30:55,215 --> 00:30:56,949
And learn this on your own.

419
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,486
I don't have time to train you.

420
00:30:59,646 --> 00:31:02,702
I was mixing whiskey sours for my mama
when I was in first grade.

421
00:31:02,822 --> 00:31:05,501
- It's just like riding a bicycle.
- That's fucked up.

422
00:31:05,621 --> 00:31:06,699
You think?

423
00:31:07,904 --> 00:31:09,274
My mama crazy.

424
00:31:09,611 --> 00:31:10,646
Damn, girl.

425
00:31:11,652 --> 00:31:13,380
Hey, Sam, is my sister here?

426
00:31:13,823 --> 00:31:15,364
No, Sookie already went home.

427
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:23,468
My name is Tara. Been your sister's
best friend since kindergarten?

428
00:31:23,628 --> 00:31:26,471
I used to sleep over
at your house for, like, years.

429
00:31:27,466 --> 00:31:29,952
- I know who you are.
- You better know who I am.

430
00:31:33,749 --> 00:31:34,953
Hello, stranger

431
00:31:41,747 --> 00:31:42,770
Come here.

432
00:31:45,851 --> 00:31:47,633
Look at you. You look great.

433
00:31:49,182 --> 00:31:50,578
- How you been?
- Fine.

434
00:31:51,012 --> 00:31:52,059
Partyin'.

435
00:31:52,264 --> 00:31:53,515
So you ain't mad at me?

436
00:31:55,345 --> 00:31:57,933
- Why would I be mad at you?
- Well, for not calling. You know.

437
00:31:58,122 --> 00:31:59,145
The usual.

438
00:32:00,457 --> 00:32:03,299
I ain't got no expectations of you.
I'm not an idiot.

439
00:32:06,542 --> 00:32:08,263
What time do you get off work?

440
00:32:08,423 --> 00:32:09,779
Well, I don't know.

441
00:32:11,326 --> 00:32:12,141
Right now.

442
00:32:14,887 --> 00:32:16,489
You want to go somewhere?

443
00:32:17,013 --> 00:32:18,794
Well, yeah, I do.

444
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:21,238
I want to go home.

445
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:24,975
Good night, Tara.

446
00:32:26,154 --> 00:32:27,226
Oh, my God.

447
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:31,113
You are a gigantic parody of yourself
and you don't even know it.

448
00:32:31,487 --> 00:32:33,400
Great seeing you, Tara, good luck.

449
00:32:34,875 --> 00:32:35,958
"Good luck"?

450
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:37,703
Good luck with what?

451
00:32:38,798 --> 00:32:39,533
Shit.

452
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:56,871
Hey, Gran.

453
00:32:57,713 --> 00:32:58,605
Hi, honey.

454
00:32:59,091 --> 00:33:00,398
Guess what happened tonight?

455
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,401
You got a date.

456
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,364
A vampire came into the bar.

457
00:33:10,062 --> 00:33:11,495
Did he have fangs?

458
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:14,537
Yeah, but most of the time
they stayed put away.

459
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:16,789
- Did he bite anybody?
- No.

460
00:33:17,088 --> 00:33:19,062
He just had a glass of wine.

461
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:21,298
He ordered it, but didn't drink it.

462
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:23,838
I think he just wanted some company.

463
00:33:24,271 --> 00:33:25,381
Did you like him?

464
00:33:27,015 --> 00:33:29,302
He was real interesting.

465
00:33:35,092 --> 00:33:36,816
I'll let you get to bed.

466
00:33:38,464 --> 00:33:42,160
Okay, honey, I just stayed up
until you got here.

467
00:33:42,767 --> 00:33:43,887
Come on, Tina.

468
00:34:49,131 --> 00:34:50,069
Hello.

469
00:34:56,668 --> 00:34:59,798
I never thought
I would be having sex with you.

470
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:02,205
At least...

471
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,316
not so fast.

472
00:35:06,875 --> 00:35:09,125
Who said anything about sex?

473
00:35:28,455 --> 00:35:30,851
How come you didn't tell me
you beat up the Rattrays last night?

474
00:35:30,971 --> 00:35:33,483
- I haven't even seen you since then.
- Where's Gran?

475
00:35:33,603 --> 00:35:36,685
Hanging the laundry out back.
And you keep your voice down.

476
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:38,647
I don't want her
to know about any of this.

477
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:42,101
Fortenberry couldn't wait till I got
to work{\ this morning} to tell me all about it.

478
00:35:42,221 --> 00:35:44,340
Hoyt Fortenberry?
How the heck does he know?

479
00:35:44,574 --> 00:35:47,023
He went over to the Rats last night
to buy some weed.

480
00:35:47,184 --> 00:35:50,219
And Denise drove up like she wanted
to kill somebody she was so mad.

481
00:35:50,463 --> 00:35:52,260
The only way she would sell him
any weed was

482
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,906
if he would drive Mack
to the hospital in Monroe.

483
00:35:55,777 --> 00:35:58,159
Did Hoyt tell you that Mack
came after me with a knife?

484
00:35:58,678 --> 00:36:01,287
Motherfucker.
You want me to kick his ass?

485
00:36:01,447 --> 00:36:03,414
I already took care of that,
thank you.

486
00:36:05,257 --> 00:36:06,942
What are you doing {\messing}with him anyway?

487
00:36:07,062 --> 00:36:09,337
Did you know that in addition
to dealing drugs,

488
00:36:09,457 --> 00:36:11,547
the Rats also happen to be
vampire drainers?

489
00:36:13,652 --> 00:36:15,635
One of my customers
last night was a vampire,

490
00:36:15,795 --> 00:36:18,045
and they were draining
him out in the parking lot.

491
00:36:18,165 --> 00:36:19,806
I couldn't have that.

492
00:36:19,967 --> 00:36:22,180
You do not want to get mixed up
with vampires.

493
00:36:22,619 --> 00:36:24,310
- Trust me.
- Oh, shut up.

494
00:36:24,470 --> 00:36:26,121
Even if you hate vampires,

495
00:36:26,241 --> 00:36:28,473
you can't let trash like the Rats go
and drain them.

496
00:36:28,593 --> 00:36:30,579
It's not like
siphoning gas out of a car.

497
00:36:30,699 --> 00:36:32,360
They would have left him {\in the woods to }die.

498
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,278
Who fucking cares?
He's already dead.

499
00:36:34,439 --> 00:36:35,935
That's not his fault.

500
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:41,828
What did he look like?

501
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:44,362
Handsome

502
00:36:44,987 --> 00:36:46,185
in a sort of...

503
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:50,628
Sort of old-fashioned,
like from a movie on TCM.

504
00:36:50,789 --> 00:36:52,474
- Was he bald-headed?
- No.

505
00:36:52,775 --> 00:36:54,605
- He had really nice hair.
- Tattoos?

506
00:36:54,725 --> 00:36:56,602
None that I could see.

507
00:36:59,271 --> 00:37:02,473
Sakes alive, boy, where have you
been keeping yourself?

508
00:37:02,774 --> 00:37:04,351
You get on over here and hug my neck.

509
00:37:04,471 --> 00:37:06,171
You get here, Gran.

510
00:37:06,677 --> 00:37:07,940
How's my girl?

511
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:10,197
- You're all sweaty.
- I know.

512
00:37:10,317 --> 00:37:12,761
- You want some ice tea?
- I would love some ice tea.

513
00:37:13,663 --> 00:37:14,819
Here, I got it.

514
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,629
- Want the rest of that?
- Yes.

515
00:37:21,027 --> 00:37:22,158
Thank you.

516
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:28,655
If you're gonna wear that suit, you
might want to {\start watching}watch what you eat.

517
00:37:31,378 --> 00:37:32,497
You look nice.

518
00:37:33,713 --> 00:37:35,386
That was Evalee Mason.

519
00:37:36,815 --> 00:37:40,303
Guess who was found strangled
to death in her apartment.

520
00:37:41,196 --> 00:37:44,157
- Maudette Pickens.
- Oh, my Lord.

521
00:37:46,077 --> 00:37:49,351
She didn't show up for work.
Wasn't answering her phone.

522
00:37:49,471 --> 00:37:52,035
And so her boss called Bud Dearborne,

523
00:37:52,155 --> 00:37:55,151
he rode over, got the manager
to let him in,

524
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:56,665
and they found her

525
00:37:57,604 --> 00:37:59,614
I went to high school with Maudette.

526
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:01,979
Can you believe it?

527
00:38:02,353 --> 00:38:03,821
A murder in Benton.

528
00:38:03,941 --> 00:38:07,246
Why are you surprised
now that we got ourselves a vampire?

529
00:38:07,406 --> 00:38:10,082
Just because he's a vampire
doesn't mean he's a murderer.

530
00:38:10,345 --> 00:38:13,306
Fang-bangers go missing all the time
in Shreveport, New Orleans.

531
00:38:13,426 --> 00:38:16,622
They never find them but everybody
knows the vampires are killing them

532
00:38:16,742 --> 00:38:20,245
- and then disposing of the bodies.
- What's a fang-banger?

533
00:38:20,615 --> 00:38:21,987
A vampire groupie.

534
00:38:23,191 --> 00:38:26,115
Men and women who like to get bitten.

535
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:27,716
My stars.

536
00:38:28,035 --> 00:38:29,792
Maudette was a fang-banger?

537
00:38:31,044 --> 00:38:32,464
How do you know that?

538
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,636
I don't know, Sookie.

539
00:38:35,756 --> 00:38:38,055
The way that you
just know things sometimes.

540
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:52,011
There's also hookers

541
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:54,093
who specialize in vampires.

542
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:56,416
They drink Tru Blood
to keep their supply up,

543
00:38:56,633 --> 00:39:00,611
and they keep a bodyguard there in case
the vamp gets a little too frisky.

544
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,131
I read that in a magazine.

545
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:11,155
Wonder how much one would charge
for something like that.

546
00:39:11,275 --> 00:39:12,311
A thousand bucks.

547
00:39:12,942 --> 00:39:15,108
See, now that just makes me sick.

548
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:16,661
I know.

549
00:39:17,146 --> 00:39:19,944
What kind of cheap woman
could ever do something like that?

550
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:22,830
No, it makes me sick
that they're getting a thousand bucks

551
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:26,801
to lay there and do nothing while I bust
my ass for 10 bucks an hour plus tips.

552
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:29,345
I don't think they just lay there.

553
00:39:29,854 --> 00:39:31,510
I think they're expected to,

554
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,689
you know,

555
00:39:32,809 --> 00:39:34,041
participate.

556
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:47,888
Thanks for lunch.

557
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:52,437
What?

558
00:39:53,629 --> 00:39:54,448
What?

559
00:39:54,568 --> 00:39:57,815
<i>This can't be happening to me.
How could I lose control like that?</i>

560
00:39:57,975 --> 00:40:00,340
<i>- How come she...</i>
- Don't try that with me, goddamn it.

561
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,544
I'm your brother.

562
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,208
Back to work.

563
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:18,763
Please?

564
00:40:21,093 --> 00:40:23,674
Come on, Dawn,
I'm having a really bad day.

565
00:40:23,933 --> 00:40:27,553
- That is not my responsibility.
<i>- Didn't we have a good time?</i>

566
00:40:27,861 --> 00:40:29,619
And don't you want to have
that again?

567
00:40:29,739 --> 00:40:33,205
I'm sorry to break it to you, but you
are not my only source for a good time.

568
00:40:33,783 --> 00:40:36,034
No, but I am the best one.

569
00:40:36,846 --> 00:40:38,616
Oh, my God, you're so full of shit.

570
00:40:39,699 --> 00:40:41,859
<i>- But I'm hot.</i>
- So am I.

571
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,872
Yeah, I know, I know.

572
00:40:47,327 --> 00:40:49,033
That's why I'm on the phone with you.

573
00:40:49,824 --> 00:40:51,365
All right, I give up.

574
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:53,315
You can meet me after work.

575
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,581
<i>I gotta go. I'll call you back.</i>

576
00:41:06,142 --> 00:41:07,176
Sheriff Dearborne.

577
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,171
Afternoon, Jason.

578
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:19,605
- There something I can help you with?
- You know Maudette Pickens?

579
00:41:19,815 --> 00:41:20,898
Sure, I know her.

580
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:23,526
I buy stuff at the Grabbit Quik.
She works there during the day.

581
00:41:23,784 --> 00:41:26,320
How would you characterize
your relationship with Maudette?

582
00:41:27,155 --> 00:41:28,178
Relationship?

583
00:41:28,406 --> 00:41:31,242
I didn't have a relationship with her.
I barely even knew her.

584
00:41:31,578 --> 00:41:33,828
So you're aware
she was murdered last night?

585
00:41:38,685 --> 00:41:40,626
I mean, yeah. Yeah. I did know that.

586
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:42,633
My grandmother told me at lunch.

587
00:41:43,038 --> 00:41:44,420
Somebody called her.

588
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:47,634
What's up with Jason and the law?

589
00:41:48,711 --> 00:41:51,347
Maybe they think he knows
something about Maudette.

590
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:53,848
You ever visit Maudette
at her apartment?

591
00:41:54,504 --> 00:41:55,454
Me? No.

592
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:57,248
Ever?

593
00:41:59,396 --> 00:42:02,398
Boys, I could do a lot better
than Maudette Pickens, believe me.

594
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,997
You weren't there last night?

595
00:42:08,092 --> 00:42:09,103
Last night.

596
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,533
Okay, yeah, I was there last night.

597
00:42:13,611 --> 00:42:15,898
- Then why didn't you say so?
- What?

598
00:42:16,018 --> 00:42:17,535
Then why didn't you say so?

599
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:19,650
Because I know she got killed,

600
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:22,501
and I thought it would look bad
me having been at her place.

601
00:42:22,816 --> 00:42:26,077
- Well, it does look bad, Jason.
- It looks real bad.

602
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:27,744
Okay, look.

603
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:31,886
I hooked up with Maudette
last night, we had sex.

604
00:42:32,469 --> 00:42:33,443
That's all.

605
00:42:34,599 --> 00:42:37,141
How would you characterize the sex?

606
00:42:39,383 --> 00:42:42,021
- Tt was okay.
- Nothing out of the ordinary?

607
00:42:45,832 --> 00:42:47,860
Because we've already seen
the videotape.

608
00:42:55,262 --> 00:42:56,827
You didn't know she was taping it?

609
00:43:00,022 --> 00:43:01,334
But I should have.

610
00:43:01,936 --> 00:43:03,753
You need to come with us, Jason.

611
00:43:06,094 --> 00:43:08,261
Just let me tell Rene to take over.

612
00:43:09,218 --> 00:43:10,466
I'll be right back.

613
00:43:12,335 --> 00:43:14,011
I hate that little shit.

614
00:43:19,804 --> 00:43:22,478
I gotta go into town for a while.
You'll take over?

615
00:43:24,431 --> 00:43:27,134
- Everything all right?
- Yeah. No, it's nothing to worry about.

616
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:28,457
Everything's fine.

617
00:43:30,684 --> 00:43:32,526
Don't tell my sister. Okay?

618
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:37,493
What'd you do, Jason?

619
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:41,493
Let's go. Move.

620
00:43:44,598 --> 00:43:45,982
What the fuck, huh?

621
00:43:55,611 --> 00:43:56,827
What's up, Gran?

622
00:44:00,058 --> 00:44:02,622
I was just wondering how old you
think the vampire is.

623
00:44:02,742 --> 00:44:04,463
The one you met last night.

624
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:06,458
I have no idea.

625
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:07,480
Why?

626
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:11,294
You think he might remember the war?

627
00:44:13,581 --> 00:44:14,814
The Civil War?

628
00:44:18,277 --> 00:44:19,240
Could be.

629
00:44:21,070 --> 00:44:22,150
If he does,

630
00:44:22,667 --> 00:44:24,518
I would love to have him come speak

631
00:44:24,638 --> 00:44:27,126
to the Descendants
of the Glorious Dead.

632
00:44:27,286 --> 00:44:29,158
You think he might want to?

633
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:32,708
I think he might have a hard time
showing up at the public library

634
00:44:32,828 --> 00:44:34,133
at noon on a Thursday.

635
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,031
We could have a special
meeting at night,

636
00:44:39,301 --> 00:44:42,697
or he could just come talk to me
and I could tape his recollections.

637
00:44:43,468 --> 00:44:47,319
I am sure the other members
would find it so interesting.

638
00:44:48,149 --> 00:44:51,108
I'll ask him next time
he comes in to Merlotte's.

639
00:44:51,688 --> 00:44:52,992
If he comes in.

640
00:44:58,078 --> 00:44:59,569
For all the beans.

641
00:45:00,016 --> 00:45:02,068
- Oh, baby.
- Oh, baby.

642
00:45:02,188 --> 00:45:04,454
- You can do better than that.
- Oh, baby.

643
00:45:21,623 --> 00:45:24,044
- How you doin'? What you doin' here?
- I work here.

644
00:45:24,164 --> 00:45:25,476
The hell you don't.

645
00:45:25,636 --> 00:45:28,090
Oh yes, the hell I do too,
you ugly bitch.

646
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:30,798
- You need to make peace with that.
- Shit.

647
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:32,900
Sam must have lost his damn mind,

648
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:36,078
because you should not be allowed
to work in no situation

649
00:45:36,198 --> 00:45:38,948
where you actually
got to interact with people.

650
00:45:39,221 --> 00:45:40,743
That is so no true.

651
00:45:41,148 --> 00:45:42,854
Do... Do not snap at me.

652
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,984
I have a name.
And that name is Tara.

653
00:45:46,988 --> 00:45:48,263
And isn't that funny?

654
00:45:48,383 --> 00:45:50,432
Black girl being named
after a plantation.

655
00:45:51,388 --> 00:45:54,171
I don't think it's funny.
In fact, it really pisses me off

656
00:45:54,331 --> 00:45:57,572
That my mama was either stupid
or just plain mean,

657
00:45:58,008 --> 00:46:01,695
which is why you better be nice
if you plan on getting a drink tonight.

658
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:03,363
Sorry, ma'am.

659
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,736
Do you know if Sookie found out
anything about her brother

660
00:46:10,856 --> 00:46:13,755
- getting arrested this afternoon?
- Jason got arrested?

661
00:46:14,097 --> 00:46:15,650
- For what?
- I ain't sure,

662
00:46:15,811 --> 00:46:18,667
but Maudette Pickens
did get found murdered.

663
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,462
Are you serious?

664
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:22,607
Jason couldn't kill anybody.

665
00:46:22,727 --> 00:46:25,202
And he can do a hell of a lot better
than Maudette Pickens.

666
00:46:25,362 --> 00:46:28,247
- {\Look at you.}You still got a thing for him.
- I do not.

667
00:46:28,533 --> 00:46:30,339
He's too damn stuck-up for me.

668
00:46:30,459 --> 00:46:32,668
That boy is sex on a stick.

669
00:46:32,924 --> 00:46:36,489
I don't give a good damn
how stuck-up he is. How you doin'?

670
00:46:36,891 --> 00:46:39,216
Look at you. Scaring that white boy.

671
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:43,119
Ain't nobody scaring him.
He too big to be scared.

672
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:45,787
I likes a big man.
Look at that belly.

673
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:48,156
Don't you have something to fry?

674
00:46:48,276 --> 00:46:50,125
You can be my Santa Claus.

675
00:46:53,527 --> 00:46:56,617
I'll see you later.
I'm in the phone book.

676
00:46:57,102 --> 00:46:58,976
Arrested? For what?

677
00:46:59,096 --> 00:47:02,309
- I don't know.
- Sorry about your brother.

678
00:47:03,328 --> 00:47:05,909
How come everybody knew
about this before I did?

679
00:47:06,029 --> 00:47:08,818
I was there, baby girl.
I saw him get carted away.

680
00:47:08,938 --> 00:47:11,255
I was complaining to Arlene
about Jason hanging up on me

681
00:47:11,375 --> 00:47:15,322
when we were making a date, not calling
me back, that's when she told me.

682
00:47:15,609 --> 00:47:17,953
- How does she know?
- I guess Rene told her.

683
00:47:18,356 --> 00:47:20,574
Besides, we figured you'd just...

684
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:25,348
I just what?

685
00:47:27,505 --> 00:47:30,392
Sweetie,
didn't you just know already?

686
00:47:31,405 --> 00:47:33,620
I am not... psychic.

687
00:47:37,601 --> 00:47:38,948
Damn, you suck.

688
00:47:41,008 --> 00:47:41,971
Quiet you.

689
00:47:42,288 --> 00:47:45,073
I cannot believe
I am here on my night off.

690
00:47:45,484 --> 00:47:49,428
Just pouring my hard earned money
back into Sam Merlotte's pocket.

691
00:47:51,569 --> 00:47:53,248
What happened to my brother?

692
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,586
Hell. I promised him
I wasn't going to tell ya-you.

693
00:47:57,913 --> 00:47:59,158
What happened?

694
00:48:01,997 --> 00:48:04,696
Bud Dearborne and Andy Bellefleur,

695
00:48:05,495 --> 00:48:07,188
they asked him some questions,

696
00:48:07,308 --> 00:48:10,019
and then they just threw him
in the back of the squad car.

697
00:48:10,139 --> 00:48:12,747
So you don't even know for
a fact that they arrested him?

698
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:17,558
- They didn't cuff him or nothin'.
- Sookie, I am so sorry.

699
00:48:18,308 --> 00:48:20,182
For what? Y'all are already acting

700
00:48:20,302 --> 00:48:22,924
like Jason's been convicted
of killing Maudette,

701
00:48:23,044 --> 00:48:25,659
we don't even know what
they were talking to him about.

702
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:27,971
Bud Dearborne just made a mistake.
That's all.

703
00:48:29,012 --> 00:48:31,994
It has to be, because Jason's
a real standup guy.

704
00:48:32,785 --> 00:48:34,253
No, he's not, Hoyt.

705
00:48:34,605 --> 00:48:37,292
He is selfish, egotistical,
and a complete horndog,

706
00:48:37,452 --> 00:48:38,794
but he is not a killer.

707
00:49:01,351 --> 00:49:03,986
<i>Now, just look at that,
like she's walking down the aisle</i>

708
00:49:04,146 --> 00:49:07,072
<i>on her goddamn wedding day.
Honey, just 'cause...</i>

709
00:49:07,881 --> 00:49:09,254
It's that vampire.

710
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:16,915
<i>He's got her in his sights.
I need to protect her.</i>

711
00:49:17,075 --> 00:49:19,779
<i>That's that vampire
she saved last night.</i>

712
00:49:19,899 --> 00:49:21,774
<i>Sookie, please do not...</i>

713
00:49:21,894 --> 00:49:23,890
Good evening, Miss Stackhouse.

714
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,217
<i>It ain't right, him being
here with normal people.</i>

715
00:49:27,337 --> 00:49:28,885
<i>She's going to sit...</i>

716
00:49:31,519 --> 00:49:33,899
<i>I always thought she was nice,
but I just wonder</i>

717
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:37,058
<i>what kind of a good Christian girl
would even look at a vampire...</i>

718
00:49:37,178 --> 00:49:39,294
<i>I don't think he looks
that kind of scary to me.</i>

719
00:49:39,473 --> 00:49:42,899
<i>Looks like she likes 'em tall, dark,
and dead...</i>

720
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,953
<i>Stackhouse family
ain't nothing but trash.</i>

721
00:50:07,316 --> 00:50:09,051
Your hand is cool.

722
00:50:10,157 --> 00:50:10,991
Yes...

723
00:50:12,742 --> 00:50:15,807
I'm afraid I'm not as warm as the men
that you must be accustomed to.

724
00:50:15,967 --> 00:50:16,979
What men?

725
00:50:28,368 --> 00:50:30,280
What can I get for you tonight?

726
00:50:33,332 --> 00:50:34,541
What are you?

727
00:50:36,573 --> 00:50:38,545
I told you. I'm a waitress.

728
00:50:42,549 --> 00:50:44,616
You're something more than that.

729
00:50:46,674 --> 00:50:48,298
You're something more than human.

730
00:50:48,458 --> 00:50:49,923
I beg your pardon?

731
00:50:57,943 --> 00:50:59,726
That's an unusual name.

732
00:51:01,929 --> 00:51:03,480
Is it short for something else?

733
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,201
Nope.

734
00:51:08,035 --> 00:51:09,528
Just plain Sookie.

735
00:51:12,249 --> 00:51:14,152
May I call on you sometime?

736
00:51:16,337 --> 00:51:17,452
Call on me?

737
00:51:21,650 --> 00:51:24,266
May I come and visit
with you at your home?

738
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:25,940
Sure.

739
00:51:27,455 --> 00:51:29,256
My grandmother
would love to meet you.

740
00:51:31,076 --> 00:51:34,082
That reminds me.
Can I talk to you after work?

741
00:51:34,522 --> 00:51:36,138
I have a favor to ask you.

742
00:51:38,035 --> 00:51:40,716
Of course.
After all, I am in your debt.

743
00:51:40,836 --> 00:51:42,384
Not a favor for me.

744
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,448
For my grandmother.
If you'll be up...

745
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,542
I guess you will be. Would you mind
meeting me around the back of the bar

746
00:51:51,662 --> 00:51:54,544
when I get off at...
probably around 1:30?

747
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,053
I'd be delighted.

748
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:09,209
Do you realize that every person
in this establishment

749
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:11,211
is staring at us right now?

750
00:52:19,661 --> 00:52:21,939
They're just staring at me
because...

751
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:25,415
my brother's in some kind of trouble
with the police.

752
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:30,999
But Bill,
did you know Maudette Pickens?

753
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:32,302
I did not.

754
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:36,895
They are staring at us
because I am a vampire.

755
00:52:38,964 --> 00:52:39,997
And you...

756
00:52:43,015 --> 00:52:44,072
are mortal.

757
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,957
Who cares what they think?

758
00:52:52,065 --> 00:52:54,601
I want to make
this town my home, so...

759
00:52:57,078 --> 00:52:57,886
I do.

760
00:53:03,519 --> 00:53:05,104
I'll see you at 1:30.

761
00:53:11,602 --> 00:53:14,325
<i>Run away as fast
as your legs can take you.</i>

762
00:53:15,146 --> 00:53:17,030
<i>- I guess...
- This is wrong. It's wrong.</i>

763
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:20,992
<i>I shouldn't be feeling like this.</i>
<i>I just want to watch them do it. Damn.</i>

764
00:53:21,152 --> 00:53:23,495
<i>He hypnotized her.
I heard they can do that</i>

765
00:53:23,655 --> 00:53:26,332
<i>just by looking at you.
She's gonna let him fired.</i>

766
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:28,108
<i>I'm telling Reverend...</i>

767
00:53:34,011 --> 00:53:35,734
You're being a very stupid girl.

768
00:53:35,854 --> 00:53:38,038
Who asked you?
I can take care of myself.

769
00:53:38,158 --> 00:53:40,346
I don't think so.
Mack could have cut you up last night.

770
00:53:40,466 --> 00:53:43,388
- How do you know what he'd have done?
- You settin' up a date with a vampire?

771
00:53:43,508 --> 00:53:45,679
What do you have, a death wish?
I don't have one.

772
00:53:45,799 --> 00:53:48,814
I happen to think judging
an entire group of people based

773
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:52,396
on the actions of a few individuals
within that group is morally wrong.

774
00:53:52,516 --> 00:53:55,703
I will not let you put yourself
or this bar in danger. I won't.

775
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:00,808
Am I fired?

776
00:54:02,463 --> 00:54:06,097
No, but next time you think somebody's
being harmed in the parking lot,

777
00:54:06,217 --> 00:54:07,914
pick up the phone
and call the police.

778
00:54:08,074 --> 00:54:11,169
Do not go out there alone
like a goddamn vigilante!

779
00:54:18,007 --> 00:54:19,029
<i>Oh, chère.</i>

780
00:54:26,404 --> 00:54:28,350
Don't you know
I couldn't stand to lose you?

781
00:54:28,553 --> 00:54:30,623
<i>Feels so warm, I can't help it.
I want you. Damn.</i>

782
00:54:30,743 --> 00:54:33,391
<i>You smell so good.
I love the way you smell.</i>

783
00:54:33,511 --> 00:54:36,381
<i>I love you and I always have.</i>
<i>I want to tell you the truth...</i>

784
00:54:36,501 --> 00:54:39,799
Are you out of your ever-loving mind?
That vampire wants you for dinner.

785
00:54:39,919 --> 00:54:42,930
I won't let you just walk into his trap.
Ma'am, over my dead body.

786
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:45,327
You mean too much to me.
<i>Don't you look at me like that</i>

787
00:54:45,487 --> 00:54:48,046
<i>when I'm looking out for you.</i>
<i>I never noticed how much, you and Jason</i>

788
00:54:48,166 --> 00:54:49,286
<i>have the same eyes.</i>

789
00:54:49,406 --> 00:54:51,408
<i>Such sweet eyes.
He could never kill anybody.</i>

790
00:54:51,528 --> 00:54:53,203
Oh, for heaven's sakes,

791
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,875
Jason is never going to care about you
the way you care about him.

792
00:54:55,995 --> 00:54:57,431
What the fuck y...?

793
00:54:57,991 --> 00:55:00,050
You made a promise.
You stay out of my head.

794
00:55:00,210 --> 00:55:02,680
<i>I know how hard
for her it's got to be...</i>

795
00:55:03,023 --> 00:55:06,281
<i>Maybe Jason will get shook up
by this whole Maudette...</i>

796
00:55:06,935 --> 00:55:09,559
Shut up, the both of you,
and stop bossing me around!

797
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:13,480
I am a grown woman and I am the one
who decides what I do, not one of you.

798
00:55:58,315 --> 00:56:01,367
- You want me to wait with you until...
- Go home, Sam.

799
00:56:03,657 --> 00:56:04,738
Good night.
