1
00:00:24,384 --> 00:00:26,205
If you have any silver on you,

2
00:00:27,685 --> 00:00:29,569
now would be the time to reveal it.

3
00:00:31,187 --> 00:00:33,281
No way.
I ain't that stupid.

4
00:00:33,627 --> 00:00:34,777
Yes, you are.

5
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,295
Is there blood in my hair?

6
00:00:48,066 --> 00:00:50,804
- What?
- Is there blood in my hair?

7
00:00:51,874 --> 00:00:54,220
I don't know,
I can't see in this light.

8
00:00:56,414 --> 00:00:57,528
How about now?

9
00:00:57,936 --> 00:01:00,313
Yeah, there's a little bit
of blood there.

10
00:01:00,978 --> 00:01:02,145
This is bad.

11
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:04,355
Pam is gonna kill me.

12
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,606
Who the fuck is Pam?

13
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,201
- Why, do you wanna meet her?
- No.

14
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:13,148
No. I'm good.

15
00:01:13,885 --> 00:01:14,990
You're going to.

16
00:01:23,346 --> 00:01:26,297
- Where are you taking me?
- To find out what you know.

17
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:29,846
I wouldn't try anything rash
if I were you.

18
00:01:31,272 --> 00:01:32,578
I'm still hungry.

19
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:00,346
Sync: mpm, Arrow
for the Sub Factory.

20
00:03:06,035 --> 00:03:07,593
Another first.

21
00:03:10,286 --> 00:03:11,490
How do you mean?

22
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:14,578
We've never had make-up sex before.

23
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:18,989
How does it compare to
"You thought I was dead" sex?

24
00:03:19,353 --> 00:03:21,051
That was pretty great too,

25
00:03:21,696 --> 00:03:23,785
but I wouldn't want to
go through that again.

26
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:26,539
I hate the feeling I can lost you.

27
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,958
And yet you like fighting with me.

28
00:03:29,353 --> 00:03:31,251
I don't like it.
It's just...

29
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:33,401
Let's not get too used to it then.

30
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,089
We don't want to be
one of those couples.

31
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:37,309
Yeah, right.

32
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:42,862
Holy! I am so embarrassed
I could die.

33
00:03:43,735 --> 00:03:44,785
What is it?

34
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,040
I completely forgot she was here.

35
00:03:49,334 --> 00:03:51,065
- Think she heard us?
- No.

36
00:03:51,855 --> 00:03:55,108
If she had, she'd have no compunction
about letting us know it.

37
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:57,862
You know, you might want to try
going a little easier on her.

38
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,361
It's hard enough being
a teenage girl without...

39
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:03,283
- She is a vampire, Sookie.
- So are you.

40
00:04:03,453 --> 00:04:06,615
And yet parts of your former
self are still in there, right?

41
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:09,886
I wouldn't be with you
if they weren't.

42
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:15,522
But I've had to work extremely hard

43
00:04:15,647 --> 00:04:17,912
at finding my way
back to my humanity.

44
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:21,092
Fragile as it may be.

45
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,138
When a vampire's
as new as Jessica is,

46
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:27,973
she has no humanity.

47
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:32,619
She's in the grips
of an overwhelming number

48
00:04:32,744 --> 00:04:34,129
of transformations.

49
00:04:36,118 --> 00:04:39,597
There will be times when she cannot
control even a single impulse.

50
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:42,483
Believe me, she has many.

51
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:46,653
How is that any different
from being a teenage girl?

52
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:49,050
No humanity, check.

53
00:04:49,621 --> 00:04:52,436
In the grips of overwhelming
transformations, check.

54
00:04:52,561 --> 00:04:55,006
Cannot control impulses, check.
All right.

55
00:04:55,716 --> 00:04:57,061
How is that different?

56
00:04:57,186 --> 00:04:59,486
All right, so,
what do you suggest I do?

57
00:05:00,374 --> 00:05:01,750
Just spoil the girl?

58
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,048
Give in to her
every whim and desire?

59
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:07,063
After all, that is
what every teenage girl wants, isn't it?

60
00:05:07,188 --> 00:05:09,939
You don't have to be sarcastic
with me, Bill Compton.

61
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:12,090
And you should at least
think about what I'm saying,

62
00:05:12,215 --> 00:05:15,160
if for no other reason than
what you're doing right now

63
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,066
isn't working out so hot.

64
00:05:21,213 --> 00:05:22,406
Kind of ironic.

65
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:26,116
We promised each other
we weren't gonna fight anymore,

66
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:28,390
and yet here we are.

67
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:32,548
This isn't a fight.

68
00:05:35,806 --> 00:05:36,925
Yes, it is.

69
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:43,805
Prepare to be made up to.

70
00:05:57,937 --> 00:06:00,872
This is a disaster. We'll have to go
much shorter than I planned.

71
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:03,121
Yeah, well, I said I was sorry, Pam.

72
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,752
But he took silver to me.

73
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,199
You were there. You saw it.
Defend me.

74
00:06:07,875 --> 00:06:10,910
I don't know what it is you wanna know,
but point me in the direction,

75
00:06:11,035 --> 00:06:12,413
and I give to you.

76
00:06:14,578 --> 00:06:16,670
I've seen your website.
It's quite,

77
00:06:17,225 --> 00:06:18,225
low rent.

78
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:21,058
But your clients miss you.

79
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:23,590
They're wondering
if you're ever coming back.

80
00:06:25,315 --> 00:06:26,315
Am I?

81
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,561
Look, I'm here because
of the V, right?

82
00:06:33,686 --> 00:06:35,880
How'bout I give you the names
of everybody I ever sold to?

83
00:06:36,005 --> 00:06:38,689
And all this time I thought prostitutes
were good at keeping secrets.

84
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:41,194
Don't get it twisted,
honeycomb, I'm a survivor first,

85
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:44,333
a capitalist second, and a whole bunch
of other shit after that.

86
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:46,071
But a hooker, dead last.

87
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:49,199
So if I got even a Jew
at an al Qaeda pep rally shot

88
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,305
at getting my black ass up out
this motherfucker,

89
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,662
I'm taking it.
Now, what you wanna know?

90
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:57,497
The vampire you had
your little arrangement with.

91
00:06:57,622 --> 00:06:58,782
Eddie Fournier.

92
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:01,583
What happened to him?

93
00:07:02,078 --> 00:07:03,147
I don't know.

94
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:05,043
I swear to God I don't.

95
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,518
Last time I saw him
he was doing real good.

96
00:07:10,495 --> 00:07:11,741
But I think

97
00:07:12,282 --> 00:07:13,515
he may have been taken

98
00:07:13,885 --> 00:07:14,919
by somebody.

99
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:16,875
By whom?

100
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:19,561
I don't know.
I mean I ain't sure.

101
00:07:21,212 --> 00:07:23,244
That's not very forthcoming of you.

102
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:26,903
- Chow, you're up.
- No, chill out. Shit.

103
00:07:32,264 --> 00:07:34,358
I think it... I think

104
00:07:35,315 --> 00:07:37,886
it was... Jason Stackhouse.

105
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:40,320
Jason Stackhouse?

106
00:07:40,445 --> 00:07:43,337


107
00:07:44,622 --> 00:07:47,198


108
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:50,193


109
00:07:50,318 --> 00:07:51,414


110
00:07:52,094 --> 00:07:53,972
Sadly, this information
is of no use to me.

111
00:07:54,633 --> 00:07:55,933
Not now, anyway.

112
00:07:56,823 --> 00:07:58,477
I understand dealers
of vampire blood

113
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:02,031
sometimes trade product
with one another across state lines.

114
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:05,484
Any buyers in the Dallas area?

115
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:07,982
One.

116
00:08:08,107 --> 00:08:11,296
He never gave me his name though.
I have an e-mail address.

117
00:08:11,754 --> 00:08:14,397
pussylover9@shemail.com

118
00:08:17,826 --> 00:08:19,498
A friend of mine in the Dallas area,

119
00:08:19,667 --> 00:08:21,866
his name is Godrick,
has gone missing.

120
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:25,507
Now, while the circumstances
of his disappearance are unclear,

121
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:27,964
it stands to reason
his blood would be very valuable,

122
00:08:28,765 --> 00:08:30,425
as he's over twice my age

123
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,707
and ten times the vampire
I will ever be.

124
00:08:32,832 --> 00:08:34,550
Eric, you don't do humble well.

125
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:36,598
I was not being humble.
This happens to be true.

126
00:08:38,563 --> 00:08:41,373
Your associate, this "pussylover".

127
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:45,315
Has he or she mentioned
any new product coming on the market?

128
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:50,635
And I would tell you.
You know that.

129
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:53,444
Take our guest
and lock him back out, will you?

130
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:55,534
Fuck, I ain't going back
down there. I gave you...

131
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:58,995
- You gave me nothing!
- I'm not going back.

132
00:08:59,446 --> 00:09:00,680
Chow, now.

133
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,210
I gave you every...

134
00:09:05,864 --> 00:09:07,657
I gave you everything!

135
00:09:08,338 --> 00:09:10,507
I ain't going back down!

136
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:34,658
Luke McDonald. No relation
to the restaurant.

137
00:09:36,408 --> 00:09:38,013
Any relation to the farm?

138
00:09:39,284 --> 00:09:40,284
What farm?

139
00:09:41,762 --> 00:09:42,812
Never mind.

140
00:09:43,186 --> 00:09:45,299
Jason Stackhouse.
Nice to meet you.

141
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:46,624
You play ball?

142
00:09:48,552 --> 00:09:49,615
What position?

143
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,090
QB one, actually.

144
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,303
Tight end.
Second team all-American.

145
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:55,803
I don't doubt it, man.

146
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,052
Look at you. You'd
make one hell of a target.

147
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,581
I'd have liked throwing to you.

148
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,077
You would have.

149
00:10:01,202 --> 00:10:03,008
Blew my knee out.
Freshman year at college.

150
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,185
Texas A&M.

151
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:07,708
You had the scholarship
and everything?

152
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,350
Everything happens for a reason.

153
00:10:10,949 --> 00:10:14,259
If it weren't for my knee,
I'd have never found my true calling.

154
00:10:14,384 --> 00:10:18,010
And it might have taken me
three solid years of Bible study

155
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:20,448
and abstinence and applying
and reapplying to do it,

156
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:22,205
but it was all worth it.

157
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:24,386
It all led me to
this moment, right here,

158
00:10:24,511 --> 00:10:26,123
getting on this here bus.

159
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:33,507
How about you?

160
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,538
When'd you set your heart on
going to leadership conference?

161
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,746
Two days ago.

162
00:10:41,703 --> 00:10:43,057
Two days ago.

163
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:44,961
I didn't know about it till then.

164
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:47,239
I was having breakfast
with Steve and Sarah,

165
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:49,314
and they asked me
if I wanted to come.

166
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,442
You had breakfast
with Steve and Sarah?

167
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,817
- What?
- I'll tell you what.

168
00:10:58,942 --> 00:11:01,272
With luck like yours,
maybe some of it will rub off on me.

169
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:03,996
- You wanna bunk together?
- Shit, yeah.

170
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:05,455
Don't say "shit".

171
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,498
- Shit? Oh, no.
- It's okay.

172
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,973
- Right.
- It's okay. Forgive yourself.

173
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:11,887
Let's sing.

174
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,038
I was wondering when you would wake up.
Come here.

175
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,342
- What?
- You smell nasty and nice,

176
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:36,432
all at the same time.

177
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:42,242
So, as I was trying
to sleep last night,

178
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,884
I realized I don't know
that much about you.

179
00:11:45,219 --> 00:11:47,039
And I'd kind of like to, or...

180
00:11:51,908 --> 00:11:53,845
When it comes to men,
I've got a long history

181
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,149
of putting the cart so far out in front
that the horse can't see it.

182
00:11:57,274 --> 00:11:58,924
So now I'm just trying
to get it right.

183
00:11:59,533 --> 00:12:00,783
You like me, Tara.

184
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:02,596
No, I know you do.

185
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:04,222
Of course I like you.

186
00:12:04,347 --> 00:12:06,652
Take a shower
in your sweat, if I could.

187
00:12:08,158 --> 00:12:11,271
I mean, we've known each other
for what now, couple weeks?

188
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:15,281
I mean, people usually take
years unloading their baggage,

189
00:12:15,406 --> 00:12:17,194
so I'm trying to figure out
what's the rush?

190
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,481
The rush is I was just curious.

191
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,477
Now I see how bad
you want to avoid it,

192
00:12:21,602 --> 00:12:23,989
I ain't just curious
anymore. I'm worried.

193
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,456
- I don't have a job.
- I already figured that out.

194
00:12:30,229 --> 00:12:31,728
Get to the good stuff.

195
00:12:35,544 --> 00:12:37,855
The day we met, remember I told you

196
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,964
I was worse off than you
when Maryann found me?

197
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:42,719
The truth is I was...

198
00:12:43,608 --> 00:12:46,180
living under a freeway overpass
without a penny in my pocket.

199
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:49,045
And that's a penny
I still don't have today, by the way.

200
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,786
I don't care about money.

201
00:12:53,258 --> 00:12:54,937
I've spent some time in prison.

202
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,209
What for?

203
00:12:58,359 --> 00:12:59,359
Drugs.

204
00:13:01,298 --> 00:13:02,823
Possession or dealing?

205
00:13:03,768 --> 00:13:05,065
I gotta pick one?

206
00:13:08,022 --> 00:13:09,022
Colorful.

207
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,960
And I also served
some time for armed robbery

208
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,229
and assault.

209
00:13:18,674 --> 00:13:21,465
But I got out early on the assault
charge for good behavior, so...

210
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:23,229
That's a plus.

211
00:13:24,572 --> 00:13:25,782
You oughta know.

212
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:35,121
<i>Our own Mary Simmons
spoke to the parents</i>

213
00:13:35,246 --> 00:13:37,757
<i>at their home in Shreveport
earlier today.</i>

214
00:13:38,244 --> 00:13:40,026
<i>If anyone has seen our daughter,</i>

215
00:13:41,308 --> 00:13:43,745
<i>or even if you're the person
who took her,</i>

216
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,332
<i>she's our first-born.</i>

217
00:13:45,457 --> 00:13:46,950
<i>And she's a goodhearted,</i>

218
00:13:47,357 --> 00:13:50,120
<i>smart girl who's never done anything
to harm anybody.</i>

219
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:52,674
<i>So please just bring her home.</i>

220
00:13:53,873 --> 00:13:55,906
<i>We just want to see our baby again.</i>

221
00:13:56,748 --> 00:13:59,828
<i>Another harrowing appeal
from young Jessica Hamby's mother...</i>

222
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:40,445
And so it is with open arms
that Steve and I welcome all of you

223
00:14:40,776 --> 00:14:43,298
to the Light of Day
leadership conference.

224
00:14:43,636 --> 00:14:45,856
Tomorrow's leaders today.

225
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:49,804
Amanda will be coming around
with your ring of honesty.

226
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:53,044
Your ring symbolizes the promise...

227
00:14:53,558 --> 00:14:54,558
Welcome.

228
00:14:55,013 --> 00:14:56,561
- ... to us...
- Thank you.

229
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,251
... and to yourselves.

230
00:14:58,575 --> 00:15:02,201
That you will always be
completely honest and open

231
00:15:02,326 --> 00:15:04,264
while here on this campus.

232
00:15:04,389 --> 00:15:05,899
Also, bear in mind,

233
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:09,282
that your ring is made out
of real silver.

234
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:11,968
So protect it with all your heart.

235
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:15,988
And maybe one day,
your ring will protect you.

236
00:15:16,392 --> 00:15:17,736
Die, fangers!

237
00:15:19,476 --> 00:15:21,456
Now, some of you already
have friends here,

238
00:15:21,581 --> 00:15:23,133
but most of you probably don't.

239
00:15:23,258 --> 00:15:25,175
And this is nothing to worry about.

240
00:15:25,521 --> 00:15:27,676
Because you will all
be fast friends,

241
00:15:28,382 --> 00:15:31,740
as you all have one thing in common.

242
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:34,905
Because for every one of you,

243
00:15:36,164 --> 00:15:37,993
today is the day

244
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:41,606
His Holy Light begins
to shine on you.

245
00:15:46,495 --> 00:15:47,803
Amen, brother!

246
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:50,532
- Amen.
- That's right.

247
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:54,229
Whoopsy daisy.

248
00:15:55,192 --> 00:15:57,529
- You'll get the hang of it.
- Sure.

249
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,014
- You're late.
- Sorry.

250
00:16:02,137 --> 00:16:04,045
How about me? Am I on time?

251
00:16:04,391 --> 00:16:06,006
I'm gonna go punch you in.

252
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:10,265
I was in and out of here fast last night
I barely got a look at the place.

253
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:11,136
It's...

254
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:12,679
It's so...

255
00:16:17,006 --> 00:16:17,889
Vibrant.

256
00:16:18,014 --> 00:16:21,075
Thanks for your concern,
but there's a big rodeo on Monroe today.

257
00:16:21,718 --> 00:16:23,185
So that's why we slow.

258
00:16:23,578 --> 00:16:26,020
Tara says the food here
is wonderful,

259
00:16:26,145 --> 00:16:29,222
so let's see
what I'm in the mood for.

260
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:35,158
- It's my first table. Wish me luck.
- I got this one.

261
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:36,393
Are you sure?

262
00:16:36,518 --> 00:16:39,132
You just focus
on one thing at a time.

263
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,758
Stop fucking with me.

264
00:16:51,773 --> 00:16:54,554
Tableside visit from the owner himself.
I must be important.

265
00:16:55,085 --> 00:16:56,522
I want you to leave.

266
00:16:57,713 --> 00:17:00,649
You're not really gonna
refuse me service, are you?

267
00:17:00,774 --> 00:17:03,464
I mean after I forgave you
a hundred thousand dollar loan,

268
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:06,566
the least you could do is
let me buy myself some lunch.

269
00:17:10,495 --> 00:17:11,723
What can I get you?

270
00:17:12,271 --> 00:17:14,266
I think I will go

271
00:17:14,391 --> 00:17:16,920
with the stuffed snapper

272
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:19,303
with the crawfish topping,

273
00:17:19,428 --> 00:17:20,734
the blackened rib eye,

274
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:23,885
the red beans and rice,
the fried catfish,

275
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,671
and... dear,

276
00:17:25,896 --> 00:17:28,860
now, would it be possible
to get the smothered pork chops

277
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:31,298
for lunch, even though it's here
on the dinner entrées?

278
00:17:33,019 --> 00:17:34,792
Now, how are your...?

279
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:47,615
That's how you capture the flag.

280
00:18:15,831 --> 00:18:16,981
Capture that.

281
00:18:27,445 --> 00:18:29,816
All right, show us your muscles.

282
00:18:30,198 --> 00:18:32,504
I wanna see the flag you captured.

283
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,157
Here comes Stackhouse.
He's back.

284
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,012
- I see you.
- Nice hair.

285
00:19:06,071 --> 00:19:08,049
That's what I'm talking about

286
00:19:08,722 --> 00:19:09,773
right there.

287
00:19:20,923 --> 00:19:23,034
What are you doing here?
I thought it was your day off.

288
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:24,063
It is.

289
00:19:24,188 --> 00:19:26,206
How many times do I tell you
that coming in to work

290
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,804
when you don't have to is pathetic?
It's like going back to school

291
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:31,127
- and visiting your teachers.
- I didn't come to see them.

292
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:33,195
I came to see you. So come on.

293
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:35,840
- Take a break.
- Sam will be pissed.

294
00:19:36,174 --> 00:19:37,759
He's always pissed.

295
00:19:38,735 --> 00:19:40,926
- I'm losing it, Sam.
- Terry, come on. What is this?

296
00:19:41,051 --> 00:19:43,598
It ain't my fault. How the hell
am I supposed to read her writing?

297
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,681
Motherfucker.

298
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:23,215
So, basically, you're like
a stepmother to a vampire?

299
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:25,258
Okay, you did not just call me that.

300
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,297
What about you?
How've you been?

301
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,552
I'm confused.

302
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,813
About what?

303
00:22:34,139 --> 00:22:37,016
I've been living over at Maryann's
for the last couple weeks?

304
00:22:37,141 --> 00:22:38,141
I do.

305
00:22:38,266 --> 00:22:40,399
In a lot of ways,
I don't ever wanna leave.

306
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,890
I mean, everything is taken care of
for me there.

307
00:22:43,015 --> 00:22:45,329
My bed gets made,
my laundry gets done,

308
00:22:45,454 --> 00:22:47,740
there's breakfast on the patio
served to you by a chef.

309
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,106
- Can I move in?
- Seriously, right?

310
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:52,078
But it scares me too.

311
00:22:52,517 --> 00:22:55,769
And maybe that's just 'cause
I'm not used to taking and not giving,

312
00:22:55,894 --> 00:22:58,673
but something inside me says,
"This is weird, Tara.

313
00:22:58,958 --> 00:23:00,301
"Don't trust it. "

314
00:23:00,957 --> 00:23:02,212
What do you think?

315
00:23:02,394 --> 00:23:04,770
Does all this sound
too good to be true to you?

316
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:07,754
I think before I answer that,
I have to tell you

317
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:10,430
I may have a conflict
of interest in all this.

318
00:23:11,209 --> 00:23:12,672
Conflict of interest?

319
00:23:14,044 --> 00:23:17,276
The main reason
I came to see you today was...

320
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,205
Tara Thornton,

321
00:23:21,921 --> 00:23:23,916
would you like to move in with me?

322
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:26,774
Really?
Are you serious?

323
00:23:26,899 --> 00:23:28,948
Of course I'm serious.
It would be so much fun.

324
00:23:29,506 --> 00:23:31,325
And we know we get along.
When we were kids,

325
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,213
you slept over more often
than you didn't,

326
00:23:33,338 --> 00:23:35,652
and we never wanted to pull each
other's hair out or anything.

327
00:23:35,777 --> 00:23:38,778
That's where you're wrong. I was always
jealous of your long blond hair.

328
00:23:38,903 --> 00:23:40,816
More than once I thought
about cutting it.

329
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:42,926
- You did not.
- Yes, I did.

330
00:23:45,143 --> 00:23:46,282
So, what do you think?

331
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:48,759
'Cause I've been trying
to get my act together,

332
00:23:48,884 --> 00:23:50,906
to move into Gran's room
for the past couple weeks,

333
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:54,819
and your moving in might be
the kick in the butt I need to do it.

334
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:02,721
That's right on my feet.
How am I supposed to ignore that?

335
00:24:02,846 --> 00:24:04,066
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,782
If you wanna make it to Bill's tonight,
you better get out of here

337
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:09,551
- before Sam asks you to stay.
- You're probably right.

338
00:24:15,947 --> 00:24:18,337
Is this the infamous Sookie?

339
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,894
- It's nice to meet you.
- Oh, likewise.

340
00:24:24,524 --> 00:24:26,380
You're very special, you know.

341
00:24:26,976 --> 00:24:29,300
I mean, to have been through
everything you have in your life,

342
00:24:29,879 --> 00:24:31,375
not to mention the last few weeks

343
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,371
and to emerge through all of it
walking, let alone smiling.

344
00:24:35,815 --> 00:24:37,529
It's simply astonishing.

345
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:41,813
I see what you mean about her, Tara.

346
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:48,026
She has an old soul, doesn't she?

347
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:55,171
Sorry. I'm usually good
at placing people's accents,

348
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,829
but yours I can't get a handle on.
Where are you from?

349
00:24:59,045 --> 00:25:00,122
Cape Cod.

350
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:03,918
Best potato chips in the world.

351
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,737
I'd love to stay and chat,
but I'm running late.

352
00:25:11,336 --> 00:25:14,525
Let me know what you decide
about moving in, all right? 'Cause...

353
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,726
I think it'd be really great.

354
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:24,828
She asked you to move in with her?
That was awfully nice.

355
00:25:26,302 --> 00:25:27,357
Yeah, but...

356
00:25:28,678 --> 00:25:30,319
I don't know wha'm doing, so-

357
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,719
- Who the fuck are you?
- Shit.

358
00:26:01,969 --> 00:26:02,852
Well?

359
00:26:04,503 --> 00:26:07,136
It's daytime.
Thank you, Jesus.

360
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:09,150
Thank you, God.
You're human, right?

361
00:26:09,687 --> 00:26:13,279
Kind of. But I ain't letting you go.
If that's what you're thinking.

362
00:26:14,455 --> 00:26:15,555
Look at you.

363
00:26:16,566 --> 00:26:18,113
Not only is you sexy,

364
00:26:18,871 --> 00:26:20,315
but you can read minds too.

365
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,817
That getting me all riled up
in my nether regions.

366
00:26:22,942 --> 00:26:24,992
Don't you try and flirt with me.

367
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,941
They told me to pay
special attention

368
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:29,045
to the faggot drag queen
in the basement.

369
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:31,443
Skank ass bitch,
you gonna let me up outta here!

370
00:26:31,568 --> 00:26:33,216
I do that, I'm good as dead.

371
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:35,006
And you know it.
Don't you move.

372
00:26:35,131 --> 00:26:37,506
You ain't gonna shoot me,
not with them shaky-ass hands.

373
00:26:37,631 --> 00:26:39,283
You ain't got the stomach for it.

374
00:26:41,148 --> 00:26:42,085
Bitch.

375
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,381
Holy fucker.

376
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:46,437
I'm sorry.

377
00:26:48,482 --> 00:26:50,135
I'm so fucking sorry.

378
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:55,507
I hate guns!

379
00:26:58,725 --> 00:27:00,668
I'm the one who got shot.
Will you quit screaming

380
00:27:00,793 --> 00:27:02,787
and go get me a doc
before I bleed the fuck out?

381
00:27:04,334 --> 00:27:05,748
Goddamn.

382
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:06,993
Hurry up.

383
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:08,760
Motherfucker.

384
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:12,879
- These are all dirty.
- Just give me the fucking towel.

385
00:28:42,437 --> 00:28:43,939
Jesus, everybody.

386
00:28:44,351 --> 00:28:45,376
Honesty.

387
00:28:46,394 --> 00:28:47,307
Honesty, babe!

388
00:28:47,757 --> 00:28:51,381
Let's hear it again
for our very own Amanda James!

389
00:28:53,251 --> 00:28:54,695
You did very good, honey.

390
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,988
- Definitely.
- Honesty.

391
00:28:57,322 --> 00:28:59,820
That was "Jesus Asked Me Out Today",

392
00:29:00,401 --> 00:29:03,573
and it's on her new album,
which drops next Tuesday,

393
00:29:03,698 --> 00:29:04,825
is that right?

394
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:07,286
Look for it at Wal-Mart,
Target, Cosco,

395
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,327
and of course the single's already
available for download on iTunes.

396
00:29:10,452 --> 00:29:11,812
So check it out.

397
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:15,953
I love you, Amanda!

398
00:29:17,571 --> 00:29:19,328
You hate to have to follow that.

399
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,015
All right.
Go on, go on, sit down.

400
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,847
Now finally tonight, we're gonna
wind things down with a little game,

401
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:30,731
which, while fun,
should also be instructive.

402
00:29:31,572 --> 00:29:34,250
Because as each of you heads out
into the world,

403
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:35,954
at some point,

404
00:29:36,345 --> 00:29:37,591
you will be faced

405
00:29:37,716 --> 00:29:41,237
with real life encounters
with vampire sympathizers.

406
00:29:45,034 --> 00:29:46,835
And we want to make
sure that you're ready.

407
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,349
So, Sarah, honey,
can you come on up here, please?

408
00:29:50,603 --> 00:29:52,692
Now, I'm gonna ask
my beautiful bride

409
00:29:52,817 --> 00:29:54,375
to play the part of a sympathizer.

410
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,021
Oh, come on, y'all,
it's just pretend.

411
00:30:00,146 --> 00:30:03,274
And... Jason Stackhouse.

412
00:30:03,684 --> 00:30:06,558
Why don't you come on up
and play the part of the good guy?

413
00:30:06,756 --> 00:30:07,596
Me?

414
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:10,498
You captured the flag, didn't you?

415
00:30:12,414 --> 00:30:13,864
You the man, Jason!

416
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,526
Go, Shreve, go!

417
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:37,417
I just saw my parents on TV.

418
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:39,060
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

419
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,363
I finally get why they never wanted me
to watch it in the first place.

420
00:30:42,488 --> 00:30:43,674
It's horrible.

421
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:48,018
- Where's Bill?
- I have no idea.

422
00:30:48,517 --> 00:30:51,522
All he told me was,
"Jessica, I have errands to run.

423
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:53,601
"Errands which do not require
your presence.

424
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:57,605
"So remain here and do your best
to stay out of trouble while I'm gone."

425
00:30:58,788 --> 00:31:02,077
And I hate it here.
I hate it so much.

426
00:31:13,853 --> 00:31:14,679
I...

427
00:31:17,189 --> 00:31:19,639
- I think I miss them.
- Your parents?

428
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:24,293
And my little sister.

429
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:25,518
I was always

430
00:31:26,457 --> 00:31:28,344
totally horrible to her.

431
00:31:31,186 --> 00:31:33,376
I was just such a brat...

432
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:39,688
- What's wrong?
- Sweetie,

433
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:42,006
vampires don't cry regular tears.

434
00:31:42,454 --> 00:31:44,735
So when you cry,
you're gonna cry blood from now on.

435
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:47,441
Why do you know that and I don't?

436
00:31:47,566 --> 00:31:49,714
Don't you think
I should know this about myself?

437
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:52,383
Bill should probably have told you.

438
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,877
Jeez, you think?

439
00:31:56,378 --> 00:31:57,828
Here's some tissue.

440
00:31:59,036 --> 00:32:01,091
Look, I don't know
if it helps at all,

441
00:32:01,216 --> 00:32:03,611
but I think I kind of know
how you feel. At least a little.

442
00:32:03,736 --> 00:32:04,755
No, you don't.

443
00:32:05,027 --> 00:32:07,281
I'm not saying it's the same,

444
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,655
but I lost my gran a few weeks ago,

445
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,370
and she was everything to me.

446
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,073
Everything I knew,
and now she's gone.

447
00:32:17,223 --> 00:32:20,443
But grandparents are supposed to die,
and you're still alive.

448
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:23,230
I mean, with me,
I'm the one that's dead.

449
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:25,109
It doesn't really matter who's dead.

450
00:32:25,941 --> 00:32:27,620
When people love each other,

451
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:30,327
and then suddenly one of them
isn't there anymore,

452
00:32:30,452 --> 00:32:32,640
it's the distance that hurts.

453
00:32:33,043 --> 00:32:36,161
And the distance is the same
no matter who's doing the leaving.

454
00:32:38,304 --> 00:32:41,547
What do you do when you feel
so far away you can't stand it?

455
00:32:42,391 --> 00:32:43,669
Well, sometimes

456
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,387
I'll go into her room

457
00:32:46,192 --> 00:32:47,631
and just sit there a spell.

458
00:32:48,731 --> 00:32:49,781
That helps?

459
00:32:49,997 --> 00:32:51,093
I don't know why,

460
00:32:51,382 --> 00:32:53,283
but just being someplace

461
00:32:54,402 --> 00:32:55,752
where she's been,

462
00:32:57,399 --> 00:33:00,185
it makes me feel better,
at least a little bit.

463
00:33:04,947 --> 00:33:05,947
You think

464
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,068
you could drive me
to my parents' so...

465
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,820
Okay, I did not mean to...
You know I can't do that.

466
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:13,753
Please. I would just
sit in the car. I swear.

467
00:33:14,919 --> 00:33:17,494
All I'm asking
is to sit across the street

468
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,663
and catch a glimpse of them
through the window.

469
00:33:20,518 --> 00:33:22,556
Just so I can say goodbye.

470
00:33:22,795 --> 00:33:25,226
I'm sorry.
It's just not my place.

471
00:33:25,968 --> 00:33:27,898
But if you explained it
to Bill the same way

472
00:33:28,023 --> 00:33:31,115
you just explained it to me,
I'm sure he'd take you.

473
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,290
Are you really sure about that?

474
00:33:33,576 --> 00:33:35,676
'Cause I'm not so sure he would.

475
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,531
Really?

476
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,861
But we're just driving by
and that's it.

477
00:33:51,175 --> 00:33:54,093
And we should swing by my place
and get you a change of clothes,

478
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,841
because I am not taking you
out in public dressed like that.

479
00:33:56,966 --> 00:33:59,009
Thank you, Sookie.
Thank you so, so, much.

480
00:33:59,134 --> 00:34:00,590
Don't mention it.

481
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,123
To Bill.

482
00:34:03,857 --> 00:34:04,667
Ever.

483
00:34:17,569 --> 00:34:20,126
You look positively lost.

484
00:34:20,856 --> 00:34:23,813
Yes, I do feel a little... at sea.

485
00:34:25,194 --> 00:34:27,952
I can help you pick
something out if you'd like.

486
00:34:28,681 --> 00:34:31,336
You're looking for your daughter?

487
00:34:33,532 --> 00:34:35,511
My daughter, Jessica.

488
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:37,541
Such a pretty name.

489
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:40,016
What do you think

490
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:41,855
of this?

491
00:34:43,395 --> 00:34:45,748
It's very nice,
but I don't think so.

492
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,751
My, we are conservative, aren't we?

493
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:52,095
No, not really.
Just old-fashioned.

494
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:54,131
Don't be silly.

495
00:34:54,301 --> 00:34:56,433
You don't look old enough
to be old-fashioned.

496
00:34:56,558 --> 00:34:57,678
Not by a long shot.

497
00:34:58,099 --> 00:34:59,577
You'd be surprised.

498
00:35:00,728 --> 00:35:01,807
You're funny.

499
00:35:02,732 --> 00:35:04,059
And cold.

500
00:35:07,419 --> 00:35:08,647
Well, you're not...

501
00:35:09,502 --> 00:35:11,584
I am vampire. Yes.

502
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:16,443
Tell you what.

503
00:35:16,912 --> 00:35:19,291
Why don't you come with me

504
00:35:19,416 --> 00:35:22,977
to the dressing room
and I could model this for you?

505
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:25,349
That's very kind of you,

506
00:35:25,822 --> 00:35:27,172
but no thank you.

507
00:35:29,307 --> 00:35:30,584
You sure, now?

508
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:31,847
I am.

509
00:35:35,114 --> 00:35:36,758
Good evening, old sport.

510
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,063
It's the new me.

511
00:35:43,392 --> 00:35:44,485
You like?

512
00:35:45,657 --> 00:35:47,646
I do. Very much.

513
00:35:59,026 --> 00:36:00,326
We need to talk.

514
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:03,592
Listen, lady, if you're gonna
give them all the rights

515
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:05,139
that normal people have,

516
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:08,310
then how am I supposed
to protect my sweet little girl

517
00:36:08,435 --> 00:36:10,501
from any vampire who wants to just

518
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,521
fly on in and marry her?

519
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:14,838
- You have a daughter?
- Well,

520
00:36:15,717 --> 00:36:18,452
I was a pretty bad boy up until

521
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:20,676
the Light of Day
leadership conference.

522
00:36:22,213 --> 00:36:23,010
So yeah.

523
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,456
It's entirely possible that I could.

524
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:28,375
Well, I don't give a hoot
about your daughter.

525
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,378
In fact, nothing you say
about vampire rights

526
00:36:31,503 --> 00:36:33,497
is gonna change my mind.

527
00:36:33,622 --> 00:36:34,733
Because...

528
00:36:39,514 --> 00:36:41,156
I am a vampire.

529
00:37:12,828 --> 00:37:13,856
I'm so sorry.

530
00:37:15,676 --> 00:37:16,676
It's okay.

531
00:37:22,521 --> 00:37:24,790
- It's okay.
- You all right?

532
00:37:33,261 --> 00:37:35,919
I got another deluxe,
I can't guarantee that it's cooked.

533
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,659
Honey, you are sweating
like a ice-water pitcher.

534
00:37:40,153 --> 00:37:43,300
I'm feeling the pressure, Arlene.
I don't like feeling the pressure.

535
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:45,002
When was your last break?

536
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,054
I ain't taking one.

537
00:37:47,224 --> 00:37:48,924
I'm coming around there.

538
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:50,977
Daphne! Order up!

539
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:55,824
Fucking...

540
00:37:58,781 --> 00:38:00,267
- Give me your tongs.
- I'm fine.

541
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:01,842
Give me your tongs.

542
00:38:03,361 --> 00:38:04,781
Taking a break.

543
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,663
Be a doll, take that out
to table four.

544
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,996
Which one's table four again?

545
00:38:13,922 --> 00:38:16,290
Well, I... I'll find it.
I'll find it.

546
00:38:17,092 --> 00:38:18,937
She ain't working out.
Nope.

547
00:38:20,437 --> 00:38:21,506
It's funny.

548
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:24,176
Most of these orders
are going out to table four.

549
00:38:24,728 --> 00:38:27,301
What the hell's
going on at table four?

550
00:38:33,008 --> 00:38:35,187
Miss! Miss?
I think you're looking for me.

551
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,347
I'd have stood there all night
if you hadn't noticed me.

552
00:38:39,472 --> 00:38:41,485
- So, thanks.
- Are you new here?

553
00:38:43,017 --> 00:38:46,073
- How could you tell?
- Because you care about doing good.

554
00:38:46,475 --> 00:38:50,274
Now you just keep on caring and one day
you'll be the best at what you do.

555
00:38:50,508 --> 00:38:51,916
That's my advice.

556
00:39:05,575 --> 00:39:08,735
- Don't you think you've had enough?
- I know what you're thinking.

557
00:39:09,537 --> 00:39:11,151
Nine years sober.

558
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,356
Why give it all up?

559
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:15,625
Well, what I got to say to that is:

560
00:39:16,832 --> 00:39:18,212
why the hell not?

561
00:39:18,337 --> 00:39:21,316
Lots of people in this town
don't need to see you this way.

562
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:25,723
The people in this town
don't see me.

563
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,805
Not for what I really am.

564
00:39:28,113 --> 00:39:30,315
Well, how about you quit
feeling sorry for yourself

565
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,690
and suck it up?

566
00:39:32,829 --> 00:39:35,496
You want respect from people,
start by respecting yourself.

567
00:39:35,942 --> 00:39:38,215
Bud took me off a case, Sam.

568
00:39:38,649 --> 00:39:42,087
I don't know about you, but in my book
that's a capital D motion.

569
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:44,488
I'm sorry, I didn't know that.

570
00:39:44,613 --> 00:39:47,175
I'll get back on the right path
tomorrow but tonight...

571
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:49,510
Don't cut me off, all right?

572
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:50,921
No problem.

573
00:39:54,638 --> 00:39:57,721
One of the things I set out to do
when I opened up here,

574
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:01,038
was to have a place where you
could come, get a drink,

575
00:40:01,163 --> 00:40:03,414
and nobody would bother you to dance.

576
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:05,816
I am with you there.

577
00:40:06,563 --> 00:40:07,863
I hate to dance.

578
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:10,549
This one time,

579
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,400
I was in a club in Shreveport,

580
00:40:13,925 --> 00:40:16,270
and I actually had a woman tell me

581
00:40:16,395 --> 00:40:18,790
I looked like an epileptic on meth.

582
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,400
Never again, Sam.

583
00:40:23,992 --> 00:40:24,921
Never again.

584
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:23,490
The sheriff of Area 9
in Texas has gone missing.

585
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:25,706
Have you heard about that?

586
00:41:25,831 --> 00:41:28,091
I hadn't, but I know
the vampire of whom we speak.

587
00:41:28,216 --> 00:41:30,718
- His name is Godrick, correct?
- Indeed.

588
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:34,813
Now it goes without saying
he needs to be found.

589
00:41:35,438 --> 00:41:37,557
Which is where Sookie comes in.

590
00:41:39,549 --> 00:41:41,305
As she's yours,
I'm asking your permission

591
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,223
to take her with me to Dallas.

592
00:41:44,254 --> 00:41:46,069
Eric, you can do
whatever you want with me,

593
00:41:46,194 --> 00:41:49,229
but I am not putting her
in this position anymore.

594
00:41:49,354 --> 00:41:52,050
I cannot and I will not allow you
to bring her into these matters.

595
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,401
We made a deal, your human and I.

596
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,693
That if I didn't kill, she would work
for me as often as I like.

597
00:41:59,781 --> 00:42:02,726
Now, you remember this, don't you?
You were there.

598
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,995
Taking her cross state lines
is a far cry

599
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:07,023
from taking her
to Fangtasia for the evening.

600
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,625
I'm only asking
your permission out of respect.

601
00:42:11,308 --> 00:42:13,864
If I want her,
I can simply take her.

602
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:19,369
Is "no" your final answer?

603
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,880
It is.

604
00:42:23,605 --> 00:42:25,105
Poorly played, Bill.

605
00:42:33,315 --> 00:42:34,665
Here, this is it.

606
00:42:34,937 --> 00:42:36,337
Across the street.

607
00:42:43,742 --> 00:42:45,592
My daddy won't be home yet,

608
00:42:46,843 --> 00:42:49,343
but my mama and sister
should be there.

609
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,164
I'm sorry.

610
00:43:07,766 --> 00:43:09,516
Well, why are you crying?

611
00:43:09,946 --> 00:43:12,029
Because I did this to you.

612
00:43:14,442 --> 00:43:16,056
If Bill hadn't...

613
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,036
I took your life away,

614
00:43:19,375 --> 00:43:22,272
and I know there's no way
you'll ever be able to forgive me.

615
00:43:22,397 --> 00:43:23,850
It's not even right to ask.

616
00:43:25,518 --> 00:43:26,998
But I had no idea

617
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,236
it was gonna lead to this.

618
00:43:32,791 --> 00:43:34,584
I don't blame you, Sookie.

619
00:43:35,808 --> 00:43:37,558
How's that even possible?

620
00:43:38,491 --> 00:43:39,574
There's my sister.

621
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:46,179
Get back in the car!

622
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,025
You promised.

623
00:43:50,225 --> 00:43:51,225
<i>Fault</i>

624
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,628
<i>front door.</i>

625
00:43:54,957 --> 00:43:55,816
Mom?

353
00:43:57,558 --> 00:43:58,928
Don't cry.

626
00:44:05,476 --> 00:44:06,518
Where were you?

627
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:08,902
It doesn't matter.
Just call your father.

628
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,509
And... And tell him
that Jessica's home.

629
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:16,196
Momma, I'd like to introduce you
to my...

630
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,447
my friend.
This is Sookie.

631
00:44:23,625 --> 00:44:25,917
Thank you so much
for bringing her back.

632
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:27,080
You're welcome.

633
00:44:30,543 --> 00:44:34,547
- Aren't you gonna invite us in?
- What?! No, no. We can't stay.

634
00:44:35,044 --> 00:44:36,894
Honey, your arm's like ice.

635
00:44:37,499 --> 00:44:39,733
Come on in
and I'll make you some tea.

636
00:44:39,858 --> 00:44:41,052
Come on.

637
00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:56,605
What just walked through that door?

638
00:44:57,158 --> 00:44:58,158
Trouble.

639
00:44:59,704 --> 00:45:01,811
- Eggs, I'm working.
- I know. I'm sorry.

640
00:45:01,936 --> 00:45:04,379
I got something to say, and I want you
to hear me out, all right?

641
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:06,953
- I'll hear you out.
- Jane Bodenhouse.

642
00:45:07,121 --> 00:45:10,764
You are a crazy-ass drunk, but normally
you wait for some loser to hit on you.

643
00:45:10,889 --> 00:45:12,727
What the hell has gotten into you?

644
00:45:13,665 --> 00:45:14,815
I don't know.

645
00:45:19,475 --> 00:45:20,383
What?

646
00:45:24,255 --> 00:45:25,638
All right. Listen.

647
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,930
My dad left us
when I was a little kid.

648
00:45:28,055 --> 00:45:30,250
So I don't remember shit
about him except this:

649
00:45:30,375 --> 00:45:33,203
he used to always say,
"You can't get what you want in life,

650
00:45:33,328 --> 00:45:35,993
"so in order to get it,
you have to appear not to want it."

651
00:45:37,243 --> 00:45:38,882
Well, I say fuck that.

652
00:45:40,887 --> 00:45:43,948
I wanna be with you, Tara,
and I refuse to pretend I don't.

653
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:50,303
Detective Bellefleur,
you come dance with me.

654
00:45:50,428 --> 00:45:51,628
I don't dance.

655
00:45:52,154 --> 00:45:54,835
With me you do.
Come on! Come on!

656
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:56,600
What the hell!

657
00:45:57,206 --> 00:45:58,986
It's my last night drinking.

658
00:46:04,943 --> 00:46:07,243
Think you walk on water, don't you?

659
00:46:09,376 --> 00:46:11,851
I'm pretty sure that was Moses.

660
00:46:12,551 --> 00:46:13,901
No, it was Jesus.

661
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,563
Moses parted the Red Sea.

662
00:46:16,569 --> 00:46:19,859
And what was the deal with you snapping
the American flag in half like you some

663
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,829
Muslim Buffy with a dick?

664
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,237
That's all kinds of messed up.

665
00:46:24,813 --> 00:46:27,659
I'm sorry you didn't like it, Mac,
but everyone else...

666
00:46:27,827 --> 00:46:30,954
Your being here
is a joke, Stackhouse.

667
00:46:31,798 --> 00:46:34,165
They may not see it now,
but they will.

668
00:46:34,529 --> 00:46:36,466
Day one might have went to you.

669
00:46:36,591 --> 00:46:39,059
Day two belongs to the Luke-inator.

670
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,557
<i>Die, fangers!</i>

671
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:52,873
<i>Jason Stackhouse,
you're a tool of Satan.</i>

672
00:46:53,908 --> 00:46:55,558
He probably tripled it.

673
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:57,045
<i>Traitor.</i>

674
00:46:58,414 --> 00:46:59,464
Just drink.

675
00:47:01,883 --> 00:47:04,318
<i>They may not see it now,</i>
<i>but they will.</i>

676
00:47:07,055 --> 00:47:08,360
Goddamn it.

677
00:48:13,173 --> 00:48:16,833
- The fuck is going on out there?
- What you're talking about.

678
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,612
The dancing and the gyrating

679
00:48:18,737 --> 00:48:20,980
and the people nearly
having sex on the pool table?

680
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,233
I don't know what to tell you.
People came back in a good mood.

681
00:48:24,403 --> 00:48:27,076
Damn it, Maryann, this is my bar,
these are my people.

682
00:48:27,201 --> 00:48:28,595
This is my town!

683
00:48:30,306 --> 00:48:31,282
Don't do that.

684
00:48:31,473 --> 00:48:33,471
I've seen you do that before.

685
00:48:38,096 --> 00:48:39,096
Stop it.

686
00:48:55,339 --> 00:48:57,684
What I just did to you,
I can do anytime,

687
00:48:57,852 --> 00:48:58,708
anywhere.

688
00:48:58,833 --> 00:49:01,636
So unless you want your customers
to know your little secret,

689
00:49:01,761 --> 00:49:04,063
you better think twice
before you threaten me ever again.

690
00:49:04,188 --> 00:49:05,897
Do we understand each other?

691
00:49:07,183 --> 00:49:08,778
I don't normally cuss, but you have

692
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,220
completely fucked me.

693
00:49:10,345 --> 00:49:13,973
I know and I'm sorry, but I swear
it was like it wasn't even me doing it.

694
00:49:14,098 --> 00:49:16,760
It must be those new vampire
impulse control issues.

695
00:49:16,885 --> 00:49:18,478
Fuck your impulse control issues.

696
00:49:18,603 --> 00:49:20,832
Here some sandwiches,
Mom's making tea.

697
00:49:21,346 --> 00:49:23,668
Oh, thanks, Eden.
Thank you.

698
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:26,139
You already had dinner.
Don't touch those sandwiches.

699
00:49:26,264 --> 00:49:27,380
You're pretty.

700
00:49:27,562 --> 00:49:29,739
Why, that's awful nice of you.

701
00:49:29,864 --> 00:49:31,925
And you're very pretty yourself.

702
00:49:33,608 --> 00:49:35,612
I'm not.
Got a problem with hair.

703
00:49:35,737 --> 00:49:37,778
<i>Fault: front door.</i>

704
00:49:54,595 --> 00:49:56,576
- How could you do this?
- Daddy.

705
00:49:57,072 --> 00:49:59,454
Do you have any idea what
you put your mother through?

706
00:49:59,922 --> 00:50:02,247
Why, Jessica?
You tell me why?

707
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:04,542
- Mr. Hamby!
- Or I will make you tell me!

708
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:07,348
Go ahead, Daddy.
Get your belt.

709
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:14,237
But this time,
I'll be ready for you.

710
00:50:19,731 --> 00:50:21,858
How much blood
do you think he's lost?

711
00:50:21,983 --> 00:50:23,977
Oh, I still think
he has something to offer.

712
00:50:24,278 --> 00:50:26,606
I hate to let it all
go to waste like this.

713
00:50:26,788 --> 00:50:29,810
- Seems a shame we have to wait for him.
- Maybe one day you'll be sheriff

714
00:50:29,935 --> 00:50:31,367
and you can make the rules.

715
00:50:31,492 --> 00:50:33,341
- I doubt that.
- Me too.

716
00:50:35,263 --> 00:50:37,360
Sorry to keep you
waiting for so long.

717
00:50:37,876 --> 00:50:39,076
How's the leg?

718
00:50:39,542 --> 00:50:41,442
Shitty.
Thanks for asking.

719
00:50:41,970 --> 00:50:44,273
After all your proclamations
about what a model prisoner

720
00:50:44,398 --> 00:50:45,936
you were going to be,

721
00:50:46,061 --> 00:50:47,634
you had to try to escape.

722
00:50:47,759 --> 00:50:49,675
You were going to
kill me anyway, right?

723
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:51,172
Now you'll never know.

724
00:50:51,987 --> 00:50:53,966
So, what's it gonna be, Lafayette?

725
00:50:54,232 --> 00:50:57,512
Would you like the leg to kill you,
or would you prefer us to do it?

726
00:50:57,702 --> 00:50:59,452
I'm gonna go with plan C.

727
00:51:01,017 --> 00:51:02,350
There's a plan C?

728
00:51:02,995 --> 00:51:04,395
Make me a vampire.

729
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:07,396
I beg your pardon?

730
00:51:07,744 --> 00:51:09,691
And you can put me to work
in the bar.

731
00:51:10,434 --> 00:51:13,084
I'm a good dancer.
You seen it on my site.

732
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:16,227
Shit, I get up there

733
00:51:16,728 --> 00:51:19,074
and move Earth and heaven,
go-go style.

734
00:51:20,302 --> 00:51:23,386
You are aware there's
a gaping hole in your leg?

735
00:51:23,511 --> 00:51:24,706
You're damaged goods.

736
00:51:24,879 --> 00:51:26,329
Not if you turn me.

737
00:51:27,272 --> 00:51:28,807
I'll be good as ever.

738
00:51:29,726 --> 00:51:30,726
Look, I...

739
00:51:31,662 --> 00:51:33,162
I'm already a person

740
00:51:33,388 --> 00:51:35,648
of poor moral character,

741
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:37,635
so I'll hit the ground running.

742
00:51:38,143 --> 00:51:40,876
And I damn near
glamour people already.

743
00:51:41,892 --> 00:51:44,157
Give me what y'all got,

744
00:51:44,282 --> 00:51:45,982
and it's on me, cracker.

745
00:51:47,318 --> 00:51:50,231
Not only will I be a badass vampire,

746
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:54,675
but I'll be your badass vampire.

747
00:51:55,819 --> 00:51:56,738
Interesting.

748
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:01,098
I'll take it under advisement.

749
00:52:04,936 --> 00:52:05,788
Chow?

750
00:52:08,189 --> 00:52:09,189
Chowtime.

751
00:52:18,017 --> 00:52:20,219
How could you let some bloodsucker
bite you like that?

752
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:23,638
I didn't let anybody do anything me.

753
00:52:24,706 --> 00:52:26,666
But, am I glad he did.

754
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,835
'Cause now, I get to homeschool you

755
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,610
in what it's like to be scared.

756
00:52:33,081 --> 00:52:35,650
Jesus Christ, Sookie.
Would you shut the fuck up?

757
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:37,660
- You okay?
- Baby, please.

758
00:52:37,785 --> 00:52:38,821
This isn't you.

759
00:52:38,989 --> 00:52:40,615
You don't know anything about me.

760
00:52:40,788 --> 00:52:42,283
You're too dumb to know anything.

761
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:47,371
What? She is dumb. She's dumber
than a sack full of hammers,

762
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,123
and he's as mean as a snake.

763
00:52:49,532 --> 00:52:52,382
And that's the way
it's always gonna be around here.

764
00:52:57,372 --> 00:52:58,633
So I am ending it.

765
00:52:58,970 --> 00:53:00,844
Right here, right now.

766
00:53:01,324 --> 00:53:03,262
And I am doing it with your belt.

767
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:09,227
Daddy?

768
00:53:09,434 --> 00:53:10,775
It's okay, baby.

769
00:53:16,622 --> 00:53:17,810
Don't worry.

770
00:53:18,054 --> 00:53:20,204
This will only hurt for a minute.

771
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,076
Jessica, let him go.

772
00:53:25,249 --> 00:53:27,543
- But...
- As your maker I command you.

773
00:53:27,668 --> 00:53:28,768
God help us.

774
00:53:30,124 --> 00:53:31,791
- Thank God you're here.
- Shut up.

775
00:53:32,567 --> 00:53:33,567
Now,

776
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,628
someone who lives here
must invite me in.

777
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:38,046
Don't, he's one of them.
He'll kill us all.

778
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:41,884
- He won't. He's not like that.
- You. Little girl.

779
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:43,954
Come here.

780
00:53:45,551 --> 00:53:47,701
- Come back here!
- Eden, don't.

781
00:53:51,309 --> 00:53:52,270
Good girl.

782
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,522
Now, you listen to me.

783
00:53:55,202 --> 00:53:56,732
I'm here to protect you.

784
00:53:57,771 --> 00:54:00,270
You and your mother and your father.

785
00:54:01,736 --> 00:54:03,086
I am your friend.

786
00:54:04,425 --> 00:54:06,125
So you just invite me in

787
00:54:07,164 --> 00:54:09,264
and I can make everything stop.

788
00:54:11,224 --> 00:54:12,224
You can?

789
00:54:17,315 --> 00:54:19,189
Won't you please come in, sir?

790
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:23,174
- I'm sorry.
- Get the hell outta here.

791
00:54:23,357 --> 00:54:24,719
So I can clean up your mess.

792
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:26,769
- Please don't kill them.
- This is your fault.

793
00:54:26,894 --> 00:54:28,723
Now get the hell outta here.
