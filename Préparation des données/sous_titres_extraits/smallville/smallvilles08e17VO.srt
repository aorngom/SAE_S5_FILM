1
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,667
You shouldn't have.

2
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,267
Uh, clark's sorry
he couldn't make it.

3
00:00:24,301 --> 00:00:26,468
He and bart are off ...
yeah.

4
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,001
Dealing with a crisis
in keystone.

5
00:00:29,034 --> 00:00:31,967
I know.

6
00:00:32,001 --> 00:00:34,834
Well, come on. Let's, uh ...
let's see what you got.

7
00:00:42,334 --> 00:00:44,667
I haven't seen this
in ages.

8
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,167
You okay?

9
00:00:53,201 --> 00:00:56,201
Yeah.

10
00:00:57,734 --> 00:01:01,867
Birthdays just make me
a little reflective.

11
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,934
What do you say we get you
out of your head

12
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:05,067
and into the party, huh?

13
00:01:05,101 --> 00:01:07,334
Come on.

14
00:01:11,134 --> 00:01:13,934
See? Case in point.

15
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:16,067
That was supposed to
be my life.

16
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:18,034
Ollie,
when did this happen?

17
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:21,101
One day i'm on the fast track
for my dream career

18
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:23,468
as the intrepid reporter,
and then i blink.

19
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,234
And all of a sudden,
i'm this underqualified shrink

20
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:27,567
for meteor-infected kids

21
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,067
who will probably wake up
to be psycho killers,

22
00:01:30,101 --> 00:01:32,401
while lois and clark
are walking the beach

23
00:01:32,434 --> 00:01:34,900
with matching press passes
together.

24
00:01:34,934 --> 00:01:37,401
Oh, and did i mention
that i was actually able to

25
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:39,101
hold on to
"happily ever after"

26
00:01:39,134 --> 00:01:43,101
for about 2.3 seconds
before my marriage imploded?

27
00:01:43,134 --> 00:01:45,533
Is this the part where you
belt out the soprano's aria

28
00:01:45,567 --> 00:01:47,267
and drive a dagger
into your corset?

29
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:53,134
Right.
Sorry for the operetta.

30
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:55,867
It's just, i would love to know
how she does it.

31
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,500
You know, chloe,
if i didn't know you any better,

32
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,800
i'd say there was a hint
of jealousy in there.

33
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:02,767
No.

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,334
It's just...

35
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:07,167
with all these debbie ups
and downers lately,

36
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:09,667
i guess it would be really nice
to leave it all behind

37
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,767
and be back
in the bullpen.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,334
Hey!

39
00:02:15,934 --> 00:02:19,234
One year closer to
the sweet release of death.

40
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:21,301
How wonderfully morbid.

41
00:02:21,334 --> 00:02:22,900
Chloe, i am so sorry.

42
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,500
There's been a factory workers
revolt in mexico city,

43
00:02:25,533 --> 00:02:28,667
and the planet is flying me down
el primero classo,

44
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,101
wheels up in 30.

45
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:34,101
Don't do anything
i wouldn't do.

46
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:36,134
Love you.

47
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:53,867
Oh, chloe, i got to ...

48
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,334
duty calls.
It's fine.

49
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:58,867
I'm ...  i'm sorry.

50
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,967
Happy birthday, chloe.

51
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:05,401
Now, there's a man who looks
like he needs a little magic

52
00:03:05,434 --> 00:03:06,700
in his button-up life.

53
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:07,767
Uh, you know what?

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
I wouldn't want to steal
the hocus-pocus away

55
00:03:09,834 --> 00:03:10,900
from the birthday girl.

56
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:12,700
How about
a little something special

57
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,600
for the someone
who truly deserves it?

58
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:17,934
Okay?

59
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:24,533
Rough birthday, huh?

60
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:27,934
You ever seen the napalm scene
in "apocalypse now"?

61
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:30,667
More fire, less cake.

62
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,867
Let's make sure
tomorrow's a better day, hmm?

63
00:03:35,468 --> 00:03:37,867
Make a wish.

64
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:31,867
Oh, my god. I'm lois.

65
00:04:49,034 --> 00:04:55,967
Smallville 817

For seriessub.com

68
00:05:32,567 --> 00:05:35,567
So, everything's okay with you
in mexico, lois?

69
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,201
Everything's great!

70
00:05:37,234 --> 00:05:39,534
Except for government oppression
and slave labor. Why?

71
00:05:39,567 --> 00:05:42,534
Uh...it's just...

72
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,801
you're sure?
Nothing weird?

73
00:05:46,834 --> 00:05:48,034
No.

74
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:51,400
Chlo, what is going on?
You don't sound like yourself.

75
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:55,234
No, uh, me?

76
00:05:55,268 --> 00:05:58,367
Just got a frog
in my throat.

77
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,067
Okay.
Well, you take care.

78
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:04,934
You, too.

79
00:06:12,634 --> 00:06:16,634
Nice job on that
city-hall piece, lane.

80
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:20,400
Dry cleaning and
your morning coffee, miss lane.

81
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:24,567
Thanks. Um...

82
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,767
oh, don't worry,
miss lane.

83
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,467
You'll remember my name
one of these days.

84
00:06:34,168 --> 00:06:36,967
Right.

85
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:19,268
Thank god. Clark.

86
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,600
You couldn't have been deported
that quickly.

87
00:07:20,634 --> 00:07:21,634
Why aren't you in mexico?

88
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:25,600
Isn't there a limit
to how tight a shirt can be

89
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:27,534
to meet dress code?

90
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:30,967
Really? Even you?

91
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:32,268
Well...

92
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,567
here's the thing.

93
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,700
I never made it
to mexico.

94
00:07:35,734 --> 00:07:37,834
Right, can this wait till
until after your post-lunch,

95
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,567
predinner,
after-coffee snack break?

96
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:43,567
I can't imagine you having any
more to say after last night.

97
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,634
Last night?

98
00:07:46,667 --> 00:07:48,567
Yeah, you called me five times
from the airport,

99
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,667
one from the airplane.

100
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,300
You had time to answer
six phone calls,

101
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:55,201
and you couldn't call chloe
on her birthday?

102
00:07:55,234 --> 00:07:58,134
Chloe knows sometimes
i get hung up at the...farm.

103
00:07:58,168 --> 00:07:59,834
And if this not-so-hidden
attitude is because

104
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:01,333
you still think
that i'm taking jimmy's side

105
00:08:01,367 --> 00:08:02,634
on the whole
breakup thing,

106
00:08:02,667 --> 00:08:05,867
it's because i believe there
are two sides to every story.

107
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:10,667
Really?
Exactly what two sides?

108
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:14,134
Look, he may have
gone overboard on the whole...

109
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,634
davis bloome
serial-killer thing,

110
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:17,934
but it's got to be tough

111
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,234
when the person that you're
trying to build your life with

112
00:08:20,268 --> 00:08:23,268
doesn't believe in you.

113
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,567
Lois, are you all right?

114
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:31,667
No, i am definitely
not all right.

115
00:08:33,034 --> 00:08:35,333
Well, this should help ...
police standoff, main and 5th.

116
00:08:35,367 --> 00:08:37,201
Grab your jacket.

117
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:43,001
Isn't this the part
where you tell me to saddle up?

118
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:48,700
Start your engines...
smallville.

119
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,867
Now,
why do i get the feeling

120
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:23,600
you're not my 10:00
from the steel union?

121
00:09:23,634 --> 00:09:25,234
Zatanna.

122
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,333
We weren't
properly introduced.

123
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:30,934
"Zatanna."
Lose a bet with that name?

124
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:33,168
It's a family thing.

125
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:34,667
Okay.

126
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,500
So, uh, zatanna...
is it? Right.

127
00:09:37,534 --> 00:09:40,168
...you mind telling me what
drives a lovely young woman

128
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,767
such as yourself to track down
an unsuspecting c.e.o.

129
00:09:42,801 --> 00:09:45,001
At a nightclub
and then again at his office?

130
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:46,767
I need your help.

131
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:48,801
You don't scream
"charity case."

132
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:51,901
My father left me an estate
in shadowcrest,

133
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:54,500
so money isn't an object.

134
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:59,967
Shadowcrest.

135
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:06,333
John zatara,
the maestro of magic ...

136
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:07,467
he was your father?

137
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:11,201
Well, i'm sorry.

138
00:10:11,234 --> 00:10:13,467
I know what it's like
to lose family.

139
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,134
Yeah.

140
00:10:15,168 --> 00:10:17,500
I lost more than my father.

141
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,234
I lost his entire legacy,
recorded in a book

142
00:10:20,268 --> 00:10:22,967
that's been passed down
through generations.

143
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:26,467
There's a bible's worth
of my heritage in those pages.

144
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,901
When my father died,

145
00:10:27,934 --> 00:10:30,801
mr. Luthor acquired that book
at auction.

146
00:10:33,634 --> 00:10:36,101
Well, no offense,
zatanna,

147
00:10:36,134 --> 00:10:37,433
but, uh,
you're the daughter

148
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:38,967
of the world's
greatest magician.

149
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:40,967
Can't you just ...
i don't know ...

150
00:10:41,001 --> 00:10:42,967
wiggle your nose and pull it out
of a hat or something?

151
00:10:44,834 --> 00:10:47,801
You're cute. And, no.

152
00:10:47,834 --> 00:10:49,467
My father refused
to teach me much

153
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,700
beyond practical
parlor tricks.

154
00:10:55,268 --> 00:10:57,534
Well, i'm sorry.
I really wish i could help.

155
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,101
Queen industries

156
00:10:59,134 --> 00:11:01,234
may have absorbed
all of luthorcorp holdings,

157
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,534
but i'm afraid
lex's lawyers

158
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,967
won't let me anywhere near
his private collection.

159
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,067
I thought i was gonna have to
use a little incentive.

160
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:13,901
See, i have the ability
to grant one wish.

161
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:16,333
Big or small, whatever you wish
for in that moment,

162
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:17,834
it can be yours.

163
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:24,934
Well,
that's very tempting.

164
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:26,234
But as you can see,

165
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:28,534
i'm pretty comfortable
with my life the way it is.

166
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:30,667
Well, there has to be
somebody you've lost,

167
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,168
something
that you've done

168
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,600
that you wish
you could take back.

169
00:11:35,734 --> 00:11:39,201
Get me my book,
and i'll make it happen.

170
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,433
Offer expires
at midnight.

171
00:11:55,417 --> 00:11:57,317
You haven't insulted me
once yet today.

172
00:11:58,251 --> 00:12:00,518
And you actually crossed
at the crosswalk.

173
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,783
Did jeff not bring you
your coffee today?

174
00:12:02,817 --> 00:12:07,351
Uh...let's just say i rolled out
of bed on the right side.

175
00:12:07,384 --> 00:12:11,184
It's amazing how much more
you can see with fresh eyes.

176
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:14,117
So, anything else
you want to tell me ...  oh, ooh.

177
00:12:18,551 --> 00:12:20,618
What's the look for?

178
00:12:22,484 --> 00:12:27,650
You just never looked at me
that way before.

179
00:12:34,084 --> 00:12:35,917
There's our story calling.

180
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:52,217
Technically,
it still is a standoff.

181
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,384
All right, lane.

182
00:12:56,417 --> 00:12:57,850
This squares us up before
friday night's poker game.

183
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:01,817
And, by the way, i've been
working on my bluff, okay?

184
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,683
Right. Keep up the good work,
there, tough guy.

185
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:09,584
So, what's the deal

186
00:13:09,618 --> 00:13:11,351
with our sophoclean
town crier up there?

187
00:13:12,884 --> 00:13:14,817
Yeah, well,
here's the situation.

188
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,850
Nutjob up there
on the fire escape ...

189
00:13:16,884 --> 00:13:20,683
he owns yuri's antiques
over on main street.

190
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,984
He's been babbling in latin
like this all day.

191
00:13:24,584 --> 00:13:26,850
I'll see you on friday.

192
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:34,717
"Woman...magic cursed on.

193
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,117
Book brings death."

194
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:38,783
Since when did you
speak latin?

195
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:41,884
Zatanna! Zatanna!

196
00:13:41,917 --> 00:13:44,251
Zatanna.

197
00:13:45,584 --> 00:13:49,050
I bet it is that same
witchy woman who did this to me.

198
00:13:49,084 --> 00:13:51,284
Now, i know where
she's performing tonight.

199
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:53,850
Maybe you can superspeed
over to this antique shop

200
00:13:53,884 --> 00:13:55,184
and dust off any leads.

201
00:13:55,217 --> 00:13:58,884
"Superspeed"?
We didn't even bring a car.

202
00:13:58,917 --> 00:14:01,050
What?

203
00:14:01,084 --> 00:14:03,884
It's okay.
I'm chloe.

204
00:14:06,284 --> 00:14:08,817
"Stood her up at formal"
chloe?

205
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,084
"Planted one on you

206
00:14:10,117 --> 00:14:12,884
because zod was ending
the world" chloe?

207
00:14:12,917 --> 00:14:14,950
"Krypton, jor-el, fortress,
brainiac" chloe!

208
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,551
Chloe.
Bingo.

209
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:20,151
And just like that raving
wardrobe malfunction over there,

210
00:14:20,184 --> 00:14:22,783
some magician showed up
at my birthday party

211
00:14:22,817 --> 00:14:24,217
in fishnets
and hexed me!

212
00:14:24,251 --> 00:14:25,950
But you'd know that
if you hadn't skipped it

213
00:14:25,984 --> 00:14:27,317
to answer voice mails
from lois.

214
00:14:29,284 --> 00:14:31,284
Not that i'm dwelling.

215
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,984
Not exactly hiding out,
is she?

216
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:40,783
You just woke up
like this?

217
00:14:40,817 --> 00:14:42,950
How did i not pick up
on it sooner?

218
00:14:42,984 --> 00:14:44,284
Forget about it.

219
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,817
This is my shakespearean
nightmare, not yours.

220
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,184
Although it has been
awfully illuminating.

221
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:53,451
Listen,
what i said about jimmy...

222
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:55,184
you're an
equal-opportunity good guy.

223
00:14:55,217 --> 00:14:56,217
I get it.

224
00:14:56,251 --> 00:14:58,050
I guess i'm just
not used to seeing you

225
00:14:58,084 --> 00:14:59,284
from this perspective.

226
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:03,317
By the way, "tales of the weird
& unexplained"...

227
00:15:03,351 --> 00:15:05,151
nice callback.

228
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,084
I thought it might bring you
back to a time

229
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:08,518
when, you know,
things were...

230
00:15:08,551 --> 00:15:10,184
weird and unexplained?

231
00:15:10,217 --> 00:15:13,618
You sound like
you miss it.

232
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:16,084
Oh, i don't know.

233
00:15:16,117 --> 00:15:18,251
It's just there's a whole half
of my life

234
00:15:18,284 --> 00:15:22,584
where this happens
every day.

235
00:15:22,618 --> 00:15:26,217
Weird has become so normal,
it's not even weird anymore.

236
00:15:26,251 --> 00:15:29,518
Honestly, i like what i'm doing
at the planet now.

237
00:15:29,551 --> 00:15:31,984
But i would be lying if i said
that there weren't days

238
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:33,850
when i wish i could forget
about saving the world

239
00:15:33,884 --> 00:15:35,084
and just be
a normal reporter.

240
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:40,850
Well, for now, how about you
not stick to your day job?

241
00:15:50,084 --> 00:15:52,217
It won't be much longer,
father.

242
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:54,251
Much longer for what?

243
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:01,184
I'm sorry.
Have we met?

244
00:16:02,584 --> 00:16:04,817
Does an enchanted cupcake
ring any bells?

245
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,650
You were
the birthday girl.

246
00:16:07,683 --> 00:16:11,151
You need to reverse the curse
that you put on chloe.

247
00:16:11,184 --> 00:16:13,317
Curse?

248
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:15,750
Is that what
you think happened?

249
00:16:15,783 --> 00:16:18,117
You kind of got things
backwards.

250
00:16:18,151 --> 00:16:19,584
I granted you a wish.

251
00:16:21,084 --> 00:16:24,551
And why on earth would
i wish myself into this?

252
00:16:24,584 --> 00:16:25,917
Beats me.

253
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,351
I don't write the magics, honey.
I just use them.

254
00:16:28,384 --> 00:16:32,151
Now, i'm not saying this is
your heart's deepest desire.

255
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:34,884
But in that moment...

256
00:16:34,917 --> 00:16:36,451
this is what you wanted.

257
00:16:38,451 --> 00:16:40,584
Okay,
just for a second,

258
00:16:40,618 --> 00:16:43,417
maybe i was a little jealous
of lois living my dream life

259
00:16:43,451 --> 00:16:45,451
with clark
at the planet.

260
00:16:45,484 --> 00:16:48,618
But i didn't literally
want her life.

261
00:16:48,683 --> 00:16:50,451
Not like this.

262
00:16:50,484 --> 00:16:51,817
Well, don't worry.

263
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,084
It will wear off as soon
as you don't want it anymore.

264
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:03,084
Fine.

265
00:17:03,117 --> 00:17:05,417
I don't want it.

266
00:17:08,184 --> 00:17:10,850
You keep telling
yourself that.

267
00:17:12,917 --> 00:17:15,950
Do you really think that man
from the antique shop

268
00:17:15,984 --> 00:17:18,950
wanted to end up rambling on
like a crazy person?

269
00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:24,151
Maybe he wanted
a better understanding

270
00:17:24,184 --> 00:17:25,484
of dead languages.

271
00:17:25,518 --> 00:17:28,017
I wanted an heirloom
of my father's.

272
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:30,650
We helped each other out.
Fair trade.

273
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,217
About that heirloom ...

274
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:34,551
what did yuri mean
when he said

275
00:17:34,584 --> 00:17:37,817
the book you were after
would bring death?

276
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:41,650
Some people can be a ...
a little superstitious.

277
00:17:41,683 --> 00:17:44,284
And that makes it okay
to use them.

278
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,618
Use them?

279
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:50,884
I give people
what they want.

280
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:56,351
Look, everybody has something
they're hoping for...

281
00:17:56,384 --> 00:18:00,217
something ...  something
they wish they could change.

282
00:18:02,518 --> 00:18:05,950
Even you.

283
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:09,050
I wonder what
your little wish would be.

284
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:14,984
Clark!

285
00:18:15,017 --> 00:18:16,484
Oh, no, clark.

286
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,451
Are you okay?

287
00:18:23,484 --> 00:18:27,084
Yeah, i'm fine.

288
00:18:27,117 --> 00:18:28,817
Really?

289
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:33,484
Something
has to be different.

290
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,284
I never should have
brought you along.

291
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:43,551
I forgot that magic affects you
just like the rest of us.

292
00:18:43,584 --> 00:18:44,917
Are you sure
you're all right?

293
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:46,284
Yes, lois.
Stop asking me that.

294
00:18:46,317 --> 00:18:48,017
And what do you mean
by "the rest of us"?

295
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,351
It's just that ...

296
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:51,217
wait.

297
00:18:52,584 --> 00:18:54,683
What did you just call me?

298
00:18:54,717 --> 00:18:56,618
Help!

299
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,151
Aren't you gonna
do anything?

300
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,251
You're absolutely right,
lois.

301
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:13,451
911?

302
00:19:13,917 --> 00:19:15,850
How gullible
do you think i am, lois?

303
00:19:16,384 --> 00:19:17,917
I'm chloe.
Right.

304
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,351
At first i had trouble
telling you two apart, as well.

305
00:19:20,384 --> 00:19:21,484
But lois is the tall one.

306
00:19:21,517 --> 00:19:23,117
You just acknowledged
i was chloe

307
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,651
before our run-in
with zatanna.

308
00:19:24,684 --> 00:19:26,351
She bippity-boppity-booed
you, too!

309
00:19:26,384 --> 00:19:28,217
Lois, there's no
such thing as magic.

310
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,784
It's all trapdoors
and wires.

311
00:19:29,818 --> 00:19:31,284
Okay, clark,
think about it.

312
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:32,983
Right before
we walked in there,

313
00:19:33,017 --> 00:19:35,150
you were just complaining
about how easy it would be

314
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:36,718
if you could just
forget the whole

315
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:38,950
hero-alien-everything-weird
side

316
00:19:38,983 --> 00:19:40,818
and were jusust a regular,
mundane reporter

317
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,050
living a normal life.

318
00:19:42,084 --> 00:19:45,184
If something seems too weird
to be true, it usually is.

319
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:49,084
That's rule number 4.

320
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:51,584
What?

321
00:19:55,317 --> 00:19:57,718
"Lois lane rules
of reporting."

322
00:19:57,751 --> 00:19:59,883
Come on.
Like you never let me forget.

323
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:04,818
And you framed this?

324
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:09,818
Look, you said you wanted
only one of your double lifes.

325
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,917
And whether you meant it or not,
the spell thought you did.

326
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:15,284
Exactly what other life

327
00:20:15,317 --> 00:20:17,384
is it i'm supposed to have,
lois?

328
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:29,384
Lois, what has gotten
into you?!

329
00:20:29,417 --> 00:20:30,651
Now, wait a second.

330
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:33,150
We're not allowed
to be up here, lois.

331
00:20:33,184 --> 00:20:35,883
Clark...

332
00:20:35,917 --> 00:20:37,284
snap out of it.

333
00:20:38,751 --> 00:20:41,818
You're a hero.

334
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:44,684
I'm a regular green arrow.

335
00:20:44,718 --> 00:20:48,084
Lois, i don't make the news.
I just report it.

336
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:52,150
You are the biggest news
there is.

337
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:55,084
You're a superhuman being
from another planet.

338
00:20:55,117 --> 00:20:57,850
Okay. Just don't tell
human resources, all right?

339
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:59,784
Now, i have a deadline
to meet.

340
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,250
Did you just
lock us up here?

341
00:21:09,284 --> 00:21:11,117
Open the door, clark.

342
00:21:12,351 --> 00:21:14,751
Lois, it's locked!
We need a key!

343
00:21:14,784 --> 00:21:16,017
Open the damn door,
clark.

344
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,718
Lois, if you don't ...

345
00:21:21,818 --> 00:21:24,451
now do you believe me?

346
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:28,284
What i believe is that this door
needs better maintenance.

347
00:21:28,317 --> 00:21:29,983
Look at the rust in here.

348
00:21:30,017 --> 00:21:32,017
No wonder it just pulled off
like that.

349
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,883
Okay.
Now we're gonna be stuck
up here ...

350
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:34,917
how about this?

351
00:21:37,517 --> 00:21:41,150
Listen.
Really listen.

352
00:21:41,184 --> 00:21:43,517
What do you hear?

353
00:22:11,184 --> 00:22:13,883
That's amazing.

354
00:22:15,684 --> 00:22:18,084
The acoustics up here
are incredible.

355
00:22:18,117 --> 00:22:22,184
It's like there's some perfect
echo point right here.

356
00:22:24,517 --> 00:22:26,217
Have you completely
lost your mind?

357
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,651
That could have
really hurt!

358
00:22:27,684 --> 00:22:29,184
No, it...

359
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,883
no, it wouldn't, clark.

360
00:22:35,917 --> 00:22:38,484
You've got superspeed
and superstrength

361
00:22:38,517 --> 00:22:40,784
and superhearing
and x-ray vision!

362
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,351
And i have a deadline,
lois.

363
00:22:42,384 --> 00:22:44,250
Now, please,
if you would excuse me,

364
00:22:44,284 --> 00:22:46,417
i need to find a way
to get off this roof.

365
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:50,417
Unless my superpowers
include an ability...

366
00:22:50,451 --> 00:22:52,718
to fly.

367
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:58,184
I didn't think so.

368
00:22:58,217 --> 00:23:01,117
Now...

369
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:31,751
sorry, guys.

370
00:23:31,784 --> 00:23:35,517
I'll make sure you get
a nice christmas bonus.

371
00:24:10,184 --> 00:24:12,850
Thanks, lex.

372
00:24:23,084 --> 00:24:24,784
Bravo.

373
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:27,983
You found my book
and pulled it off in style.

374
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:31,417
I wish i could say
i've had the pleasure.

375
00:24:31,451 --> 00:24:34,917
Oh, please, oliver.

376
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,384
Ask a billionaire
for help,

377
00:24:36,417 --> 00:24:40,117
and then a vigilante
steals exactly what i ask for?

378
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:42,883
You need to work
on your sleight of hand.

379
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:50,684
Yeah.

380
00:24:53,917 --> 00:24:55,551
Now...

381
00:24:55,584 --> 00:24:59,384
give me my book,
and i'll give you your wish.

382
00:24:59,417 --> 00:25:01,117
A deal's a deal.

383
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,684
You know, this isn't just
a how-to guide

384
00:25:03,718 --> 00:25:05,718
on upping
your stage presence.

385
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:08,684
There's some really dark stuff
in here, zatanna.

386
00:25:08,718 --> 00:25:10,184
You don't get it.

387
00:25:10,217 --> 00:25:12,084
The sick irony
of my ability

388
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:14,417
is that i can grant
so many wishes ...

389
00:25:14,451 --> 00:25:17,584
everyone's but mine.

390
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,684
No.

391
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:27,684
Please? Don't.

392
00:25:27,718 --> 00:25:31,050
It's the only way
i can bring my father back.

393
00:25:36,584 --> 00:25:38,417
I'm sorry.

394
00:25:43,818 --> 00:25:44,784
Not good.

395
00:25:55,784 --> 00:25:58,017
You don't
want to do this.

396
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:01,184
You can't just bring someone
back and change fate!

397
00:26:01,217 --> 00:26:06,983
I'm sorry.
I've waited too long for this.

398
00:26:08,484 --> 00:26:10,751
I'm coming, father.

399
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:26,151
I'll handle this, lois.

400
00:26:32,884 --> 00:26:34,850
Do you speak english?

401
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,151
Yes.

402
00:26:36,184 --> 00:26:38,217
You mind telling me
who you are?

403
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:41,650
Lois lane,
daily planet.

404
00:26:41,684 --> 00:26:43,184
I'm sorry.

405
00:26:43,217 --> 00:26:46,318
We thought you were
under some kind of...spell?

406
00:26:46,351 --> 00:26:48,017
Well, she did.

407
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,951
You know.

408
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,017
We know zatanna
gave you a wish

409
00:26:53,051 --> 00:26:55,684
in exchange for
some information on a book.

410
00:26:55,717 --> 00:26:58,017
I never should have told her
how to find that book.

411
00:26:58,051 --> 00:26:59,951
I'm afraid she's too blinded
by her grief

412
00:26:59,984 --> 00:27:01,583
to see the danger
that she's in.

413
00:27:03,784 --> 00:27:05,550
Say this woman
does know magic,

414
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:07,850
what sort of danger
are you talking about?

415
00:27:07,884 --> 00:27:09,750
She must be stopped
from using that book

416
00:27:09,784 --> 00:27:11,650
to resurrect her father.

417
00:27:11,684 --> 00:27:14,084
She isn't prepared
to make the sacrifice.

418
00:27:14,117 --> 00:27:15,583
What kind of sacrifice?

419
00:27:15,617 --> 00:27:17,917
From what i could decipher,

420
00:27:17,951 --> 00:27:19,750
the incantation
to bring a life back

421
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:22,450
required the taking of a life
in return.

422
00:27:22,483 --> 00:27:24,151
So, in order to bring
her father back,

423
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,184
someone else must die.

424
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:28,884
A life for a life.

425
00:27:30,583 --> 00:27:34,217
A soul for a soul.

426
00:27:50,617 --> 00:27:54,951
As life is lived
from front to back,

427
00:27:54,984 --> 00:27:59,284
let death be turned
back to front.

428
00:27:59,318 --> 00:28:01,784
Grant me my wish.

429
00:28:01,817 --> 00:28:05,450
Resurrect john zatara.

430
00:28:14,217 --> 00:28:16,184
That guy really sounded
like he believed

431
00:28:16,217 --> 00:28:17,284
in what he was saying.

432
00:28:17,318 --> 00:28:18,750
That's because
it was true.

433
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:20,450
Now we just need to
find zatanna

434
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:23,051
before she tries to give
dear old dad one final encore.

435
00:28:24,418 --> 00:28:26,084
It looks like
we may be too late.

436
00:28:29,817 --> 00:28:32,318
Clark, you're the only person
who can get up there

437
00:28:32,351 --> 00:28:34,084
and put an end to this
right now.

438
00:28:34,117 --> 00:28:36,151
I know what
you're about to say, but ...

439
00:28:36,184 --> 00:28:39,318
no, clark.
There are no buts with you.

440
00:28:39,351 --> 00:28:41,017
No exception to the rule.

441
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:44,418
Now, superleap up there
and stop her.

442
00:28:47,717 --> 00:28:49,418
Look, i don't know.
It ...

443
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:52,084
yeah, okay. Okay, clark,
you don't have to know.

444
00:28:52,117 --> 00:28:53,850
If you won't believe
in yourself,

445
00:28:53,884 --> 00:28:55,384
then let me
believe in you.

446
00:28:55,418 --> 00:28:57,117
Okay?

447
00:28:57,151 --> 00:28:59,850
I know that deep inside,

448
00:28:59,884 --> 00:29:02,384
you don't want to just
be a normal guy

449
00:29:02,418 --> 00:29:05,483
sitting behind a desk
reporting on disasters

450
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:07,984
while you could be out there
stopping them.

451
00:29:08,017 --> 00:29:13,151
Now, use the power
you feel.

452
00:29:15,184 --> 00:29:19,517
The world needs you.

453
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:31,917
Wait, that's ...

454
00:29:31,951 --> 00:29:34,951
impossible?
Only in your mind.

455
00:29:34,984 --> 00:29:37,084
Sometimes you just need
a little leap of faith.

456
00:29:37,117 --> 00:29:41,284
Come on, clark.
You can do this.

457
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:44,817
Up, up, and away.

458
00:29:59,717 --> 00:30:01,184
Daddy?

459
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,817
You need to stop
this spell.

460
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,483
Don't move.

461
00:30:06,517 --> 00:30:08,284
I need to bring
my father back.

462
00:30:08,318 --> 00:30:09,850
At what cost?

463
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:14,717
Are you willing to sacrifice
your life for him?

464
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,483
It's what he did for me.

465
00:30:16,517 --> 00:30:19,817
He wasn't meant to die.

466
00:30:19,850 --> 00:30:24,917
I owe him this.
I know the rules.

467
00:30:24,951 --> 00:30:26,951
A life for a life.

468
00:30:26,984 --> 00:30:30,217
I have to make it right.

469
00:30:32,084 --> 00:30:34,284
I'm not afraid.

470
00:30:34,318 --> 00:30:36,117
Do you really think your father
would want you

471
00:30:36,151 --> 00:30:38,051
to give up the life he gave you
to bring him back?

472
00:30:38,084 --> 00:30:39,750
What would you know
about losing the one man

473
00:30:39,784 --> 00:30:41,217
who made you
who you are?!

474
00:30:41,251 --> 00:30:43,583
Everything.

475
00:30:43,617 --> 00:30:45,617
The day
that i lost my father,

476
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:48,384
i thought my world
would never be the same.

477
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:54,151
It felt like something had been
ripped away from me forever.

478
00:30:54,184 --> 00:30:56,483
But i had to let him go.

479
00:31:06,284 --> 00:31:07,418
No.

480
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:09,650
No, it was supposed to
be me.

481
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:11,550
We don't get to choose.

482
00:31:11,583 --> 00:31:14,217
But we do get to choose
how we live the life

483
00:31:14,251 --> 00:31:15,784
that we've been given.

484
00:31:17,251 --> 00:31:21,550
I'm finally the man that
my father wanted me to be.

485
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:24,251
What does your father
want you to be?

486
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:35,583
I'm sorry.

487
00:31:46,151 --> 00:31:48,984
Close the door.

488
00:32:26,234 --> 00:32:30,133
Peace offering
for missing your party.

489
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:33,033
Casualties
of being a hero.

490
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,501
Not everyone could have punched
through zatanna's whammy

491
00:32:35,534 --> 00:32:37,133
and saved the day.

492
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:39,467
I couldn't have done it
without you.

493
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:42,200
Thank you for reminding me
who i really am.

494
00:32:42,234 --> 00:32:44,968
Yeah, i guess rebooting
your superhero o.s.

495
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,100
Rekindled the chloe fire.

496
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,133
Looks like,
uh, hero support

497
00:32:50,167 --> 00:32:52,300
isn't just a day job
anymore.

498
00:32:52,334 --> 00:32:54,133
And for that...

499
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:56,501
we eat bagels.

500
00:32:56,534 --> 00:32:58,701
Do you remember
everything?

501
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:00,300
If you're
referring to my

502
00:33:00,334 --> 00:33:01,701
"just the facts,
ma'am" routine...

503
00:33:04,434 --> 00:33:07,100
it did feel as though
a weight had been lifted.

504
00:33:08,501 --> 00:33:10,767
It must have been hard
to harness up again.

505
00:33:10,801 --> 00:33:12,000
To be honest,

506
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:14,734
a life without responsibility
kind of felt empty.

507
00:33:14,767 --> 00:33:16,901
I mean,
this is who i am, chloe.

508
00:33:16,934 --> 00:33:18,767
Every morning,
i wake up with a purpose.

509
00:33:20,334 --> 00:33:21,834
Yeah,
you're not the only one

510
00:33:21,868 --> 00:33:24,133
who saw the world
through irony-colored glasses.

511
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,367
Why did you wait so long
to tell me what was going on?

512
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:34,601
Well,
let's face it, clark.

513
00:33:34,634 --> 00:33:38,167
My life has been a little less
than desirab lately.

514
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,734
I mean,
with jimmy and everything.

515
00:33:41,801 --> 00:33:44,234
And i can't deny
there's an appeal

516
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:46,734
to the dynamic duo's
weekly adventures.

517
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:48,801
Well, you haven't
missed much.

518
00:33:48,834 --> 00:33:52,234
Things haven't exactly
been smooth between us lately.

519
00:33:52,267 --> 00:33:54,133
Look, i know
you don't want to open

520
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,801
a can of kryptonian worms
by telling her your secret.

521
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,934
But whether
you like it or not,

522
00:33:58,968 --> 00:34:02,701
lois lane is a part
of your life now.

523
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:06,400
And considering the nonstop
puppy-dog eyes you give her,

524
00:34:06,434 --> 00:34:10,100
i'm guessing
you don't mind much at all.

525
00:34:12,834 --> 00:34:15,467
Clark...just because
you were burned once

526
00:34:15,501 --> 00:34:18,734
doesn't mean that you
can't give it a second chance.

527
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:23,334
Are we still talking
about me?

528
00:34:23,367 --> 00:34:25,901
Or are we talking
about you and jimmy?

529
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:31,934
Touché.

530
00:34:31,968 --> 00:34:33,601
Okay.

531
00:34:33,634 --> 00:34:36,601
I'm talking about neither of us
living in the past.

532
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:39,901
You can never be
who you want to be

533
00:34:39,934 --> 00:34:41,467
if you're always looking
over your shoulder

534
00:34:41,501 --> 00:34:44,300
at what could have been.

535
00:34:47,067 --> 00:34:49,901
Cheers to that.

536
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:04,300
What is this? You drop by
to kick my ass again?

537
00:35:04,334 --> 00:35:06,534
So much fun for me
the first time.

538
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:08,934
I came to apologize.
I just ...

539
00:35:08,968 --> 00:35:10,734
"bound by steel," right?

540
00:35:10,767 --> 00:35:12,567
That's what you said
to me backwards ...

541
00:35:12,601 --> 00:35:13,601
"bound by steel"?

542
00:35:13,634 --> 00:35:15,300
I had plenty of time
to mull that over

543
00:35:15,334 --> 00:35:16,801
when you, uh ...
you left me there

544
00:35:16,834 --> 00:35:19,834
strung up to either die
or have my identity revealed.

545
00:35:19,868 --> 00:35:23,767
I can't ever totally make it up
to you or your friends,

546
00:35:23,801 --> 00:35:25,501
but i would like to try
to make sure

547
00:35:25,534 --> 00:35:27,634
that something like this
doesn't happen again.

548
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:30,534
Here's a thought ...
don't do it again.

549
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,934
Hold on.
Just a second.

550
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,868
It's...

551
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,634
i know how difficult

552
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:46,467
the sacrifices you made
must have been...

553
00:35:46,501 --> 00:35:48,434
especially considering
how hell-bent you were

554
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:49,767
on getting
what you wanted.

555
00:35:49,801 --> 00:35:52,968
Well, anyway, in the end,
you made the tough choice,

556
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,133
and, um...

557
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,801
i can respect that.

558
00:36:00,501 --> 00:36:03,367
Just know that there are
far more dangerous people

559
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,434
out there in the world
than me ...

560
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:07,434
people with much
greater control

561
00:36:07,467 --> 00:36:09,834
of the genuinely nasty magics
than i do.

562
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:12,200
So...

563
00:36:12,234 --> 00:36:17,300
if you ever run into my kind
of mischief again...

564
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:18,834
call me.

565
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:23,734
And wherever i am,
this time, i'm on your side.

566
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:26,834
So i guess this means you're
taking your show on the road.

567
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:29,400
Thinking about taking
a little bit of time off

568
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:31,834
to do some light reading.

569
00:36:31,868 --> 00:36:35,267
If i'm ever gonna do
my father proud...

570
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,200
i've got a lot
of catching up to do.

571
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:45,667
Uh, so...

572
00:36:45,701 --> 00:36:47,601
what ...
what is this, exactly ...

573
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:49,634
some kind of magic spell
to summon you?

574
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,067
I just hold it up,
say your name a couple times,

575
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,701
and, uh, poof,
you appear?

576
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:57,734
It's my phone number.

577
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,667
Of course it is.

578
00:37:31,834 --> 00:37:34,868
Is there something
on your mind, lois?

579
00:37:34,901 --> 00:37:37,901
So, how long did it take
for you to realize

580
00:37:37,934 --> 00:37:40,567
that i wasn't
my usual charming self?

581
00:37:40,601 --> 00:37:42,000
Well, i have to admit,

582
00:37:42,033 --> 00:37:44,367
i should have picked up
on it sooner.

583
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,434
You weren't as bossy
as usual.

584
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:51,167
And chloe let me drive.

585
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,868
Well...

586
00:37:52,901 --> 00:37:54,767
little blond sources
tell me

587
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:57,267
that you don't mind
my assertive flair.

588
00:38:02,334 --> 00:38:04,267
Let me see it.

589
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,767
Lois, i don't know
what you're talking about.

590
00:38:09,934 --> 00:38:13,434
You have a terrible
poker face, smallville.

591
00:38:17,734 --> 00:38:18,801
Gimme, gimme.

592
00:38:33,934 --> 00:38:36,400
Who would have known
you were this sentimental?

593
00:38:38,467 --> 00:38:40,767
I think we should...
hang it up

594
00:38:40,801 --> 00:38:43,133
so that everyone
can see it.

595
00:38:43,167 --> 00:38:46,667
This is a memento
from my first day on the job.

596
00:38:48,801 --> 00:38:52,467
And a constant reminder
there's only one lois lane.

597
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,834
You better believe it.

598
00:39:00,734 --> 00:39:03,133
Big night?

599
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,167
Mm, yeah. This guy
in first class asked me out,

600
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,067
and i figured
why the hell not, right?

601
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,133
Yeah.

602
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:14,667
What about you?
Big plans?

603
00:39:14,701 --> 00:39:16,100
Oh, i'm just gonna
hang around here,

604
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:17,567
you know,
follow up on a few things.

605
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:19,834
You want me to call
you if anything comes
through the wire

606
00:39:19,868 --> 00:39:21,000
to see
if you're available?

607
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:23,267
You mean if you want to
stand me up again?

608
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:27,234
Lois, that was ...
a mistake. Agreed.

609
00:39:27,267 --> 00:39:29,133
Why don't we just
table this whole

610
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:30,367
"office thrown together

611
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,334
in the trenches sparks"
thing, okay?

612
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:35,167
Back to basics.
Keep the game on the field.

613
00:39:36,968 --> 00:39:39,634
Yeah,
that's a good rule.

614
00:39:41,834 --> 00:39:44,834
You should add that
to the list.

615
00:40:00,901 --> 00:40:02,534
Ready?

616
00:40:02,567 --> 00:40:04,400
Ready as you are.

617
00:40:04,434 --> 00:40:05,734
Yeah.

618
00:40:08,434 --> 00:40:10,968
This will mean leaving your old
life as a reporter behind.

619
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,868
You sure you want to say goodbye
to that forever?

620
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:15,467
You know, yesterday

621
00:40:15,501 --> 00:40:17,300
i wouldn't have been able to
answer that question.

622
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:19,334
But after spending the day
at the daily planet,

623
00:40:19,367 --> 00:40:21,567
i realized...

624
00:40:21,601 --> 00:40:23,501
that's someone
else's life.

625
00:40:25,934 --> 00:40:27,033
It's interesting.

626
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,934
Every one seems to have
so much clarity

627
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:31,534
after a dose
of the zatanna dust.

628
00:40:31,567 --> 00:40:32,634
It almost makes me wish

629
00:40:32,667 --> 00:40:34,400
i had my turn
at the magic lamp, too.

630
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:39,300
I'll save you
the heel blisters.

631
00:40:39,334 --> 00:40:41,367
You already know
what you really want.

632
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,234
We all do.
We just don't listen.

633
00:40:46,968 --> 00:40:49,767
And you're sure
this is it.

634
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:54,434
This is where i belong.
