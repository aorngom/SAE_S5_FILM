1
00:00:07,627 --> 00:00:11,580
I didn't mean to cut your head off.
I'm just under a lot of pressure here.

2
00:00:11,581 --> 00:00:13,134
Who wants cake?

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:16,993
Another glass of bubbly?

4
00:00:17,134 --> 00:00:20,355
And throw in a shirley temple
for the lady.

5
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,323
Lois, don't you think you might
want to pace yourself?

6
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:27,493
Believe me, smallville, i am
a lot more obnoxious sober,

7
00:00:27,518 --> 00:00:32,150
And the last thing anyone wants is me
making a scene at this blessed event.

8
00:00:33,808 --> 00:00:35,977
Chloe is barely legal,

9
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:39,051
And she is getting herself
hitched to the first guy

10
00:00:39,094 --> 00:00:42,876
Who's shown her any attention,
present company excepted.

11
00:00:42,877 --> 00:00:45,390
I have suffered
enough heartache

12
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:49,450
To know real love when i see it,
and looking at those two...

13
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:51,517
I don't know.

14
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:54,267
I don't see it.

15
00:00:55,233 --> 00:00:57,196
Are you sure
you're not just jealous

16
00:00:57,197 --> 00:00:59,419
That your little cousin's
beating you to the altar?

17
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:03,151
This isn't a competition.

18
00:01:03,152 --> 00:01:04,812
Then why are you keeping score?

19
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:10,234
Listen, lois, it may not kill you
to just show a little support.

20
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,522
You want support?

21
00:01:14,903 --> 00:01:17,241
I'll show you support.

22
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:21,840
Good idea.

23
00:01:26,206 --> 00:01:29,783
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is lois lane.

24
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:32,006
Most of you know me
as chloe's cousin,

25
00:01:32,007 --> 00:01:34,431
A.K.A., the maid of honor.

26
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,252
When chloe and i were little girls,
we made a promise...

27
00:01:42,253 --> 00:01:46,700
Neither of us would get married
until we found our soul mates...

28
00:01:47,797 --> 00:01:50,558
... the one person
in the whole wide world

29
00:01:50,656 --> 00:01:52,987
That we were destined to be with...

30
00:01:54,235 --> 00:01:57,174
Which is why you can't take
a 10-Year-Old on their word.

31
00:01:59,024 --> 00:02:00,733
Okay, come on.

32
00:02:03,154 --> 00:02:08,347
What i think lois is trying to say
is that you can't predict

33
00:02:08,363 --> 00:02:11,415
When you will find
that special someone.

34
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:17,415
And jimmy is, without a doubt,
that special someone for chloe.

35
00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:24,017
I've known chloe
since the eighth grade, and...

36
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:26,569
We've been through a lot together.

37
00:02:27,283 --> 00:02:30,842
In all those years, the truth is
i've never seen her so happy.

38
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:37,500
Congratulations. To jimmy and chloe.

39
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:39,311
To jimmy and chloe.

40
00:02:43,516 --> 00:02:45,366
So, we'll see you guys in a few months.

41
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,056
Thank you so much.
You guys are great.

42
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:48,798
- Thanks.
- Bye.

43
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:52,300
You know, it's a shame your parents
couldn't be here tonight.

44
00:02:52,301 --> 00:02:55,829
I would have really loved to celebrate
your impeccable taste with them.

45
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,424
Well, they send their love.

46
00:02:57,425 --> 00:03:00,436
Dad is this close to closing
a big deal in london.

47
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:03,600
His, um, priorities are a little
out of whack, but he means well.

48
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:06,163
Oh, well, i still hope
you enjoyed yourself tonight.

49
00:03:06,164 --> 00:03:08,595
You know what was my favorite
part of the evening?

50
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:10,922
If you say lois' toast,
i'm getting a prenup.

51
00:03:10,923 --> 00:03:12,219
God, no.

52
00:03:12,998 --> 00:03:15,571
When clark was toasting us,
i looked over at you,

53
00:03:15,572 --> 00:03:18,452
And you had the most wonderful
smile on your face.

54
00:03:18,986 --> 00:03:22,676
You know, it really means a lot to me
that you're finally okay with clark.

55
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:26,543
Me being uptight about you
and clark is yesterday's news.

56
00:03:26,544 --> 00:03:29,408
There may be a textbook's worth
of history between the two of you, but

57
00:03:29,755 --> 00:03:32,465
The future is all chloe
and jimmy's story.

58
00:03:38,701 --> 00:03:40,373
You know, i think it's about time

59
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:42,851
We head upstairs for some
much-Needed alone time.

60
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,223
Oh, i think that is a fantastic idea.

61
00:04:06,781 --> 00:04:10,108
Smallville 805

62
00:04:11,612 --> 00:04:15,029
Synchro : flolo

63
00:04:50,197 --> 00:04:51,709
For seriessub.Com

64
00:05:19,389 --> 00:05:21,089
Smallville?!

65
00:05:21,429 --> 00:05:23,391
Good afternoon, lois.

66
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:26,194
I thought you might need one of these.

67
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:37,021
Please tell me we didn't...

68
00:05:46,928 --> 00:05:49,595
You're hysterical
when you're hung over, lois.

69
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:52,120
Don't worry.

70
00:05:52,526 --> 00:05:54,977
You got changed all by yourself...

71
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,767
In the middle of the kitchen
for like an hour.

72
00:06:05,802 --> 00:06:08,853
I take it i took a little drive
on the porcelain highway.

73
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:11,587
It was more like
a cross-Country trip.

74
00:06:14,687 --> 00:06:16,528
You know, i...

75
00:06:19,538 --> 00:06:21,623
You didn't have to take care
of me last night.

76
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:24,283
I would have been perfectly fine
on my own at the talon.

77
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:26,100
I don't think jimmy and chloe
would have been up

78
00:06:26,101 --> 00:06:28,037
For the white snake sing-Along.

79
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:33,169
Chloe!

80
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:37,540
I was supposed to meet her

81
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:39,534
For a dress fitting
first thing this morning.

82
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:42,007
- Do you need a ride?
- You may have held my hair,

83
00:06:42,008 --> 00:06:45,247
But i don't need you
to hold my hand, smallville.

84
00:06:45,248 --> 00:06:48,175
This may shock you,
but i can still drive a car.

85
00:06:48,176 --> 00:06:49,887
Not if it's not here.

86
00:06:51,116 --> 00:06:53,340
This may shock you,
but you were in no condition

87
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:55,482
To get behind the wheel
last night, lois.

88
00:06:57,994 --> 00:06:59,835
Thanks for the ride.

89
00:07:06,329 --> 00:07:09,042
What do you mean
you can't find the i.P. Address?

90
00:07:09,043 --> 00:07:11,133
The e-Mail came
through a ghost router.

91
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:13,946
As soon as we saw it, the router
vanished from the grid.

92
00:07:13,947 --> 00:07:17,512
At the very least, this could prove
mr. Luther is still alive.

93
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:20,123
Or it could prove that someone
is toying with me.

94
00:07:20,124 --> 00:07:23,615
Find out who took the crystal,
or find a new line of work.

95
00:07:27,344 --> 00:07:29,475
You know what's amazing to me?

96
00:07:30,052 --> 00:07:32,293
That you can't find time
to return my calls,

97
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:34,333
But you do manage to fit it
into your busy schedule

98
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:37,175
To buy the star city towers
right out from under me.

99
00:07:38,295 --> 00:07:40,389
Business is business.

100
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,321
Well, this is not about business.

101
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:47,976
And to be honest with you,
revenge is not your best color.

102
00:07:48,192 --> 00:07:50,201
Don't flatter yourself.

103
00:07:50,202 --> 00:07:52,948
One of the most important things
that lex taught meis you can't afford

104
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:54,662
To live in the past.

105
00:07:54,663 --> 00:07:57,573
Did professor luther also teach you
a thing or two about deception?

106
00:07:57,574 --> 00:08:00,651
Or how about obsession? I hear his
class in murder's an easy "a."

107
00:08:00,687 --> 00:08:03,278
He's done more for this world
than you ever will, oliver.

108
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,028
He dedicated his life
to making it a safer place.

109
00:08:09,279 --> 00:08:11,842
You know, mercy, it seems to me

110
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:14,556
Like lex may have been a little
bit more than a mentor.

111
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:21,390
If you're done wasting my time,
i have phone calls to make.

112
00:08:26,862 --> 00:08:30,797
Look, uh, i'm sorry.

113
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:34,113
Really, okay? I didn't come here
to battle with you.

114
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:36,878
Actually, i came here
to raise the white flag.

115
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,902
How civil.

116
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,885
What do you propose...
a... a truce?

117
00:08:42,069 --> 00:08:44,717
Well, truce, yeah...

118
00:08:44,718 --> 00:08:46,475
Over dinner.

119
00:08:48,805 --> 00:08:51,231
You haven't changed one bit.

120
00:08:51,232 --> 00:08:53,924
Oliver always wants
what oliver can't have.

121
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:57,580
You know, sometimes a meal's
just a meal.

122
00:09:01,191 --> 00:09:03,097
You pick me up at 7:00.

123
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:05,767
7:30 it is.

124
00:09:16,695 --> 00:09:18,342
Chloe?

125
00:09:19,064 --> 00:09:20,566
Jimmy?

126
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:23,069
You know what lois likes to see
when she comes home...

127
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,617
Pants... pants on everyone.

128
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,301
I had no idea jimmy
was so romantic.

129
00:09:43,121 --> 00:09:46,258
Guess the olsen's
not so wholesome.

130
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,400
Chloe! It's your coz!

131
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:02,567
Guess who came to my rescue...
not oliver queen.

132
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:04,463
Clark kent.

133
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:07,321
He's just the sweetest boy
i have ever known.

134
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:10,065
Chalk that one up
to alcohol poisoning.

135
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,902
This is smallville p.D., impound for
a chloe sullivan and a james olsen.

136
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:18,852
Your vehicles were just brought in
for obstructing a street cleaner.

137
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,429
You have ni...

138
00:10:20,430 --> 00:10:22,498
They didn't even come home last night?

139
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:25,556
Then where the hell are they?

140
00:10:37,234 --> 00:10:40,154
Chloe! Are you okay?

141
00:10:40,155 --> 00:10:43,558
I think so. Where are we?

142
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:47,476
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

143
00:10:47,477 --> 00:10:50,982
To find out if these two
were truly meant to be.

144
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:10,886
Lois, i checked the metropolis
and the smallville hospitals,

145
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:13,615
As well as the airport...
no sign of jimmy or chloe.

146
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:15,003
You covered a lot of ground.

147
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,829
We need to find the right people to ask.
Did you find anything?

148
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:20,381
Chloe and jimmy aren't the only
couple that's gone missing, clark.

149
00:11:20,382 --> 00:11:23,556
At least three couples in the last two
weeks have vanished without a trace.

150
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:26,395
- All engaged.
- Credit cards haven't been touched.

151
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,390
Phone records show no sign of activity.

152
00:11:28,391 --> 00:11:31,644
The list goes on and on. So unless
oprah said eloping was in for fall...

153
00:11:31,645 --> 00:11:33,295
They've all been abducted.

154
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:38,522
I called the police. They won't even declare
jimmy and chloe missing for 24 hours.

155
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:46,269
What kind of person would prey on people
during the happiest time of their lives?

156
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:49,429
You know, if i hadn't been
too drunk to go home last night,

157
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:52,462
- I would have been there to stop it.
- Or you would have been missing, too.

158
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:57,008
Don't worry, lois. We'll find them.

159
00:11:57,398 --> 00:11:59,472
We should cross-Reference
jimmy and chloe

160
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:02,356
With the other two victims, see if
they have anything in common.

161
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:05,531
One step ahead of you.
Jimmy, chloe, and the other couples

162
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:08,686
All visited the same wedding
vendors within the last 10 days.

163
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:11,465
A bakery, a jewelry store,
and a stationery shop.

164
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:12,676
To name a few.

165
00:12:12,677 --> 00:12:14,779
That stationery shop
is right around the corner.

166
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,712
I'm gonna check it out.
I'll call if i find anything.

167
00:12:16,713 --> 00:12:18,649
No way am i putting
my cousin's life

168
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,339
In the hands of a mild-Mannered copyboy.
Try to keep up.

169
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,599
The art of abduction is
surprisingly difficult.

170
00:12:44,801 --> 00:12:47,290
It's easier
when i find couples together.

171
00:12:47,812 --> 00:12:49,718
It saves time.

172
00:12:50,259 --> 00:12:52,569
Well, we'd hate
to inconvenience you.

173
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:55,775
It's no trouble at all.
It's my duty.

174
00:12:57,347 --> 00:12:58,737
What...

175
00:12:58,738 --> 00:13:01,027
- What is that?
- This is a lie detector.

176
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,867
It's fairly harmless
and not complicated at all.

177
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,949
In fact,
when you get right down to it,

178
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:09,855
It's really quite simple.

179
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,611
All it does is listen to your heart.

180
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,759
I guess you expect us to believe
that that's harmless, too.

181
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,539
No. This is electricity.

182
00:13:18,869 --> 00:13:20,897
Electricity hurts.

183
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:25,034
Is this how you get your kicks...

184
00:13:25,035 --> 00:13:27,062
Torturing innocent people?

185
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:33,629
It's not torture.
I'm doing you a favor.

186
00:13:35,673 --> 00:13:38,105
Not everyone is meant to be married.

187
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:42,249
Countless couples rush
headlong into marriage,

188
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:45,133
Ignorant to responsibility
of the burden of truth

189
00:13:45,134 --> 00:13:47,836
That comes with that level
of commitment.

190
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:56,771
Those that are truly dedicated
have no secrets.

191
00:14:03,258 --> 00:14:05,755
Let's warm up with an easy question.

192
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,456
James...

193
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:13,737
Have you ever cheated
on your fiancée before?

194
00:14:21,051 --> 00:14:22,438
No.

195
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,936
Stop! Don't hurt her!
I'm the one that lied! You hurt me!

196
00:14:28,937 --> 00:14:32,761
Lies don't hurt you!
Lies hurt the ones you love!

197
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,498
You be honest.

198
00:14:39,401 --> 00:14:40,928
Chloe...

199
00:14:41,356 --> 00:14:43,300
Look, it wasn't really cheating.
I mean, this...

200
00:14:43,344 --> 00:14:45,435
This crazy woman... she kissed me,

201
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:48,322
And i had a freakin' heart attack,
and i wound up in the hospital.

202
00:14:48,323 --> 00:14:51,096
I know. I know it wasn't your fault.

203
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:54,125
You are the only girl...

204
00:14:55,092 --> 00:14:57,007
That i've ever loved.

205
00:14:58,756 --> 00:15:00,765
That will do for now.

206
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:05,868
Let's see what the bride has to say.

207
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,022
I wonder.

208
00:15:11,851 --> 00:15:14,471
How many lies is she hiding behind?

209
00:15:23,415 --> 00:15:26,579
If this were the last place on earth
and i had to write an s.O.S.,

210
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,661
- I wouldn't come here for a nib or a quill.
- Thank you for your time.

211
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:31,883
Lois, we're not gonna get anywhere

212
00:15:31,884 --> 00:15:34,118
If you shake down
every single person we talk to.

213
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:37,730
He was stone walling us. You have to put the
screws to a perp when the clock is ticking!

214
00:15:37,731 --> 00:15:39,914
He was 70 years old, lois.
He spent the night in the hospital.

215
00:15:39,915 --> 00:15:41,416
He still had his bracelet on.

216
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:44,093
Clark, my cousin,
your best friend, is missing.

217
00:15:44,094 --> 00:15:46,457
She could be hurt or dying or worse.

218
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:48,639
Which is exactly why we can't
waste any more time.

219
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:51,510
Okay, genius,
what do you want to do?

220
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,834
You should go back to the daily planet,

221
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:56,014
See if those background checks
we ordered came in.

222
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:59,197
And just what do you plan on doing
alone that we can't do together?

223
00:15:59,198 --> 00:16:00,580
A lot.

224
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,921
Wait a minute. The guy is preying
on couples, right?

225
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,748
Don't even go there.

226
00:16:09,749 --> 00:16:12,422
So, if we walk in there
pretending to be the bait,

227
00:16:12,423 --> 00:16:14,208
We'll have him
eating out of our hands.

228
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:16,612
No one will believe it, lois,
not even for a second.

229
00:16:18,217 --> 00:16:19,719
Clark kent...

230
00:16:20,783 --> 00:16:22,680
Will you marry me?

231
00:16:28,603 --> 00:16:31,321
A smile every now and then
wouldn't kill you.

232
00:16:31,322 --> 00:16:33,776
In short supply, lois.
I wouldn't want to waste one.

233
00:16:33,777 --> 00:16:35,345
May i help you?

234
00:16:35,518 --> 00:16:39,124
Well, we are finally out ring shopping.

235
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,993
Who's the luckiest girl in the world? I am.

236
00:16:41,994 --> 00:16:43,683
Some friends of ours said
that your store

237
00:16:43,684 --> 00:16:45,683
Is the best place in town
to find engagement rings.

238
00:16:45,684 --> 00:16:48,074
Is there a certain piece
that you'd like to see?

239
00:16:48,212 --> 00:16:49,658
Well...

240
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,198
What about this one, pumpkin?

241
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:54,857
Anything you want, muffin.

242
00:16:54,893 --> 00:16:58,315
Must be great seeing so many happy
couples come through here every day.

243
00:16:58,316 --> 00:16:59,570
It certainly is.

244
00:16:59,571 --> 00:17:03,576
It's very fulfilling helping to solidify
the bond between husband and wife.

245
00:17:03,577 --> 00:17:05,898
Excellent craftsmanship...

246
00:17:06,104 --> 00:17:09,419
A perfect circle,
no beginning and no end.

247
00:17:10,561 --> 00:17:12,589
Try it on. See how it looks.

248
00:17:15,494 --> 00:17:17,685
Don't get stage fright, poodle.

249
00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:19,186
You're gonna have to do this
center stage

250
00:17:19,187 --> 00:17:21,316
In front of a packed house
sooner than you think.

251
00:17:21,972 --> 00:17:24,620
He has performance anxiety.

252
00:17:27,978 --> 00:17:30,551
Look at that... perfect fit.

253
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:42,839
What are you two doing here?

254
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:46,402
Oliver, you didn't get
the invitation yet?

255
00:17:47,089 --> 00:17:49,052
My invitation to what?

256
00:17:50,209 --> 00:17:52,050
Tell him, cupcake.

257
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,148
Lois and i are...

258
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:01,883
... we're getting married.

259
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:14,298
You're just full of surprises
lately, aren't you, clark?

260
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:15,823
I know, right?

261
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:17,410
I mean, we've been friends for so long,

262
00:18:17,411 --> 00:18:20,179
But we just had
this one magical night,

263
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,734
And we couldn't deny
our feelings any longer.

264
00:18:25,484 --> 00:18:27,193
Is this true?

265
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:30,045
I'm afraid so.

266
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:39,412
See you at the wedding.

267
00:18:47,163 --> 00:18:50,435
She has great taste.
You're a very lucky man.

268
00:18:50,436 --> 00:18:52,115
You have no idea.

269
00:18:53,012 --> 00:18:55,381
I swear, if you're this afraid
of pretend commitment,

270
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:57,153
What's gonna happen
when some poor girl

271
00:18:57,154 --> 00:18:59,416
Makes the mistake of actually
falling for you?

272
00:18:59,417 --> 00:19:01,708
This isn't working, lois.
We need to split up.

273
00:19:01,709 --> 00:19:04,010
We can track down more leads
if we go in opposite directions.

274
00:19:04,011 --> 00:19:06,813
- And what if you get into trouble?
- I think i'll be okay.

275
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:09,677
You know, you're drifting
dangerously close to cocky.

276
00:19:09,954 --> 00:19:13,306
What, no snarky comeback
from the peanut gallery?

277
00:19:19,483 --> 00:19:20,904
Please don't do this.

278
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:23,222
You should be pleading with me
to continue.

279
00:19:23,223 --> 00:19:26,226
If only someone had taken the time
to do this for my wife and i.

280
00:19:26,227 --> 00:19:28,040
Did you hook her up
to your little machine?

281
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,833
Something tells me
she didn't walk out of here.

282
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:32,400
I cherished her, james.
I honored her.

283
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,282
I did everything that i promised
when i took my wedding vows,

284
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:39,230
And how does she reward me?
With one lie after another.

285
00:19:41,725 --> 00:19:43,772
She never knew, but...

286
00:19:44,337 --> 00:19:46,628
I could smell him on her.

287
00:19:48,073 --> 00:19:50,101
So you killed her.

288
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:56,842
You see, the heart and the mouth
are not always on the same page.

289
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:04,496
Get the hell away from her.

290
00:20:05,562 --> 00:20:07,214
Chloe...

291
00:20:08,435 --> 00:20:11,243
Have you ever cheated on your fiancé?

292
00:20:12,386 --> 00:20:13,624
No.

293
00:20:16,352 --> 00:20:18,953
Excellent. Next question.

294
00:20:21,468 --> 00:20:24,519
Are you in love with anyone else?

295
00:20:26,112 --> 00:20:29,425
Look, don't answer him, chloe.
Don't give him the satisfaction.

296
00:20:31,687 --> 00:20:32,793
No!

297
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:41,328
Your fiancé is not the best person
to be taking advice from at this moment.

298
00:20:43,706 --> 00:20:46,466
Now i'm gonna ask you
one more time.

299
00:20:49,099 --> 00:20:52,790
Are you in love
with anyone else?

300
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:01,603
No.

301
00:21:14,297 --> 00:21:18,163
Only you, jimmy, forever.

302
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,970
Congratulations, james olsen,
chloe sullivan.

303
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:34,219
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

304
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,074
Mercy?

305
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:46,468
We got dinner reservations
at hobbs bay in just under an hour.

306
00:21:49,436 --> 00:21:51,445
I like to work up an appetite.

307
00:21:57,518 --> 00:21:59,742
You used to be better at this.

308
00:21:59,743 --> 00:22:01,856
What happened to not being
interested in revenge?

309
00:22:03,371 --> 00:22:05,221
This is not revenge.

310
00:22:05,222 --> 00:22:06,792
This is just practice.

311
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:09,898
Weak men like you make me stronger.

312
00:22:17,907 --> 00:22:21,756
So, you learn that lionel kills
your parents, and what do you do?

313
00:22:21,815 --> 00:22:25,120
You drink yourself onto the society
page for, what, like a month?

314
00:22:25,153 --> 00:22:28,327
Well, you know me.
I like to keep myself busy.

315
00:22:28,328 --> 00:22:31,103
You still can't take anything
seriously, can you?

316
00:22:31,104 --> 00:22:33,329
Just like our relationship.

317
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,725
You know how much
you meant to me.

318
00:22:36,726 --> 00:22:39,989
Yeah, that became clear when
i caught you with the waitress.

319
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:44,375
Or was she a hostess?

320
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:49,283
- How many times do i have to apologize?
- I don't want an apology!

321
00:22:51,346 --> 00:22:53,233
I want an explanation.

322
00:22:59,428 --> 00:23:01,609
What the hell were you so afraid of?

323
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:08,848
You.

324
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:26,875
Clark, it's lois.
I spoke with the police.

325
00:23:27,063 --> 00:23:29,655
They told me
that they think i should...

326
00:23:30,337 --> 00:23:31,902
Do you mind?

327
00:23:31,903 --> 00:23:34,909
Your high beams are burning
holes into my skull!

328
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,167
Look, i don't know
what to do anymore,

329
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:40,923
So can you give me a call
as soon as you get this? Bye.

330
00:23:41,073 --> 00:23:43,956
You'll be seeing
your fiancé soon enough.

331
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,976
Son of a bitch.

332
00:24:09,611 --> 00:24:11,165
Oh, my god.

333
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,078
Jimmy?

334
00:24:13,349 --> 00:24:15,105
Jimmy, wake up.

335
00:24:16,322 --> 00:24:17,782
We're okay.

336
00:24:18,187 --> 00:24:19,802
What the hell happened?

337
00:24:19,811 --> 00:24:22,350
The last thing i remember,
that guy pulled out that gun,

338
00:24:22,351 --> 00:24:25,604
- And then everything went black.
- I told you we'd make it out.

339
00:24:30,227 --> 00:24:34,133
Is this that masked man's idea
of some kind of a twisted joke?

340
00:24:35,887 --> 00:24:39,340
I'm gonna have to take
the credit for this one.

341
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:44,123
And for the record, it was
a lot less creepy yesterday.

342
00:24:45,311 --> 00:24:47,366
You know, i don't think
i'd still be alive

343
00:24:47,367 --> 00:24:49,969
If i was sitting across
anyone else in that room.

344
00:24:52,048 --> 00:24:54,326
Because we're meant to be together.

345
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:59,170
'Cause... things like that don't
happen to people by accident.

346
00:25:00,552 --> 00:25:01,858
No.

347
00:25:02,722 --> 00:25:05,434
Because you don't have any secrets.

348
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:18,111
We should call the sheriff.

349
00:25:20,407 --> 00:25:21,825
Okay.

350
00:25:32,296 --> 00:25:34,220
I'm glad you two are okay.

351
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:36,933
- Clark, what is it?
- It's lois. I can't find her.

352
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:39,476
She left me a voice mail, and then she
never made it back to the planet.

353
00:25:39,477 --> 00:25:41,309
She was saying something
about car headlights.

354
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,751
Headlights? That's what he used
when he took us.

355
00:25:43,752 --> 00:25:46,002
- Why would he want lois?
- It's a long story,

356
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:48,434
But if there's anything you can
remember, it might help me find lois.

357
00:25:48,435 --> 00:25:50,976
This guy, he's a certifiable
whack job, c.K.

358
00:25:50,977 --> 00:25:55,205
He was talking about how secrets
kill, and, our bond.

359
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:58,530
Stuff about... lies begetting lies.

360
00:25:58,763 --> 00:26:00,711
What did he say about your bond?

361
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:04,977
I don't know. He was talking about
how important it is to

362
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:08,550
Solidify the bond
between husband and wife.

363
00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:13,832
I know who has lois.

364
00:26:21,077 --> 00:26:24,626
Tell me right now.
What'd you do with my cousin?

365
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,667
Where is she?

366
00:26:33,597 --> 00:26:34,902
Lois?!

367
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,984
Lois.

368
00:26:37,985 --> 00:26:41,415
Clark, you got to find
chloe and jimmy.

369
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,408
He let them go. Listen, i'm gonna
get you out of here,

370
00:26:43,409 --> 00:26:44,984
But you need to tell me...
where is he?

371
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:46,335
Right behind you.

372
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:48,752
Clark!

373
00:27:01,061 --> 00:27:02,178
Clark?

374
00:27:03,252 --> 00:27:04,604
Wake up.

375
00:27:08,723 --> 00:27:10,216
Clark.

376
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:12,125
Clark.

377
00:27:13,498 --> 00:27:14,860
Wake up.

378
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:31,039
I know who you are!

379
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:38,175
Then i suppose i won't
be needing this anymore...

380
00:27:39,567 --> 00:27:41,464
Now that we're all acquainted.

381
00:27:42,164 --> 00:27:43,826
Let's begin.

382
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,597
What's the point?

383
00:27:45,598 --> 00:27:48,762
Now that we've both seen your face,
you're gonna kill us anyway.

384
00:27:48,763 --> 00:27:50,403
Don't be so certain.

385
00:27:51,787 --> 00:27:55,947
You must really care about her,
storming in here.

386
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,912
That's very gallant of you.

387
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:01,559
Yeah, he's stupid that way.

388
00:28:04,317 --> 00:28:07,538
- Let her go.
- After her turn, you'll get yours.

389
00:28:07,539 --> 00:28:08,988
My turn?

390
00:28:09,487 --> 00:28:11,853
What is this, some kind of game?

391
00:28:12,576 --> 00:28:13,772
No.

392
00:28:13,773 --> 00:28:15,757
No, it's a test,

393
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:19,188
To reveal how much you two have
been hiding from one another.

394
00:28:20,414 --> 00:28:24,057
If you pass, you'll want
to invite me to your wedding.

395
00:28:25,518 --> 00:28:27,227
If you fail...

396
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:32,337
Well, the guest list will be
the least of your worries.

397
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:37,100
Ladies first.

398
00:28:38,029 --> 00:28:40,780
Have you ever cheated
on your fiancé?

399
00:28:46,158 --> 00:28:48,449
Of course not. Don't be ridiculous.

400
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,964
What are you doing?!

401
00:28:52,561 --> 00:28:54,157
You're killing him!

402
00:28:56,384 --> 00:29:00,995
- No. Your lies are.
- Okay, okay, i take it back, then.

403
00:29:00,996 --> 00:29:04,234
I'm sorry! Just...
just don't hurt him again!

404
00:29:18,706 --> 00:29:20,368
Killing us...

405
00:29:21,133 --> 00:29:23,790
It won't take away the pain
that pushed you here.

406
00:29:23,791 --> 00:29:26,195
I'm doing this for you.

407
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:27,571
What?

408
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:31,019
The broken hearted
are the walking dead.

409
00:29:31,609 --> 00:29:36,454
Either way, i'm saving you both
a lot of unnecessary pain.

410
00:29:36,455 --> 00:29:39,769
Okay, crazy, this is the deal.

411
00:29:40,061 --> 00:29:42,746
We're not even really a couple.

412
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,433
So this twisted test
doesn't mean anything.

413
00:29:50,818 --> 00:29:52,592
Next question.

414
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,982
Deep down, underneath it all,
do you love this man?

415
00:30:03,145 --> 00:30:05,183
Answer the question, lois.

416
00:30:07,066 --> 00:30:08,944
Don't out think it.

417
00:30:10,634 --> 00:30:12,428
Just tell the truth.

418
00:30:23,826 --> 00:30:25,648
Do you love him?

419
00:30:31,477 --> 00:30:33,486
Tell the truth.

420
00:30:40,891 --> 00:30:43,586
Do you love him?

421
00:30:54,043 --> 00:30:55,318
Yes.

422
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,981
And you... do you love this woman?

423
00:31:25,909 --> 00:31:29,651
Speak up. She can't hear you
if you don't speak up.

424
00:31:59,265 --> 00:32:00,901
Lois.

425
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:05,296
- Clark?
- Lois, are you okay?

426
00:32:06,713 --> 00:32:08,300
I'm not sure.

427
00:32:11,861 --> 00:32:13,733
Let's get you out of here.

428
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:32,163
The one person in the whole wide world
that we were destined to be with,

429
00:32:32,164 --> 00:32:33,910
Which is i guess why you can't
take a 10-Year-Old...

430
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,295
Yeah, that's pretty much how i felt.

431
00:32:36,693 --> 00:32:39,688
Oh, my god, chloe, i am so sorry.

432
00:32:39,689 --> 00:32:42,363
I mean, i know my face is under
"faux pas" in the dictionary,

433
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:44,377
But this is a whole new low.

434
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:46,974
I would say that this is
a close second,

435
00:32:46,975 --> 00:32:49,706
Behind the time you crashed
lana's engagement party.

436
00:32:49,707 --> 00:32:53,745
In fact, you may want to start
avoiding engagement parties all together.

437
00:32:55,760 --> 00:33:00,033
Chloe, it's not funny.
I ruined your special night.

438
00:33:00,154 --> 00:33:02,407
Lois, considering
how the night ended,

439
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:04,868
I'd say that the party
was a rousing success.

440
00:33:04,869 --> 00:33:06,654
Besides, you were just being honest,

441
00:33:06,655 --> 00:33:09,588
Though you could he been
a little less public about it.

442
00:33:10,695 --> 00:33:14,019
Lois, why didn't you just tell me
that this is how you felt?

443
00:33:15,646 --> 00:33:17,111
I don't know.

444
00:33:17,709 --> 00:33:20,272
Look, clark and lana went south.

445
00:33:20,849 --> 00:33:23,534
Things fell apart
between me and ollie.

446
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:28,683
Just knowing that i had everything
that i wanted right in front of me...

447
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,102
And having it slip away.

448
00:33:33,493 --> 00:33:37,418
I just didn't want to see you
have that kind of heartache.

449
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:43,174
Lois, you are the most wonderful big
cousin in the world for thinking that.

450
00:33:44,014 --> 00:33:45,751
But trust me.

451
00:33:45,752 --> 00:33:49,280
I wouldn't have said yes if
i didn't know it was meant to be.

452
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,493
How can you be sure?

453
00:33:52,877 --> 00:33:57,055
Because when i look at jimmy,
i can just feel it...

454
00:33:57,163 --> 00:33:58,994
In my heart.

455
00:33:59,392 --> 00:34:02,406
I mean, sunset or dungeon, he's my guy.

456
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:07,156
Color me jealous.

457
00:34:09,095 --> 00:34:11,066
Clark was right after all.

458
00:34:12,445 --> 00:34:15,403
He usually is. Get used to it.

459
00:34:15,555 --> 00:34:17,136
Get used to what?

460
00:34:28,696 --> 00:34:30,882
To being a member of the family.

461
00:34:30,883 --> 00:34:33,153
Congratulations, jimmy.

462
00:34:34,686 --> 00:34:36,526
What was that all about?

463
00:34:36,584 --> 00:34:39,076
You and me, oddly enough.

464
00:34:39,288 --> 00:34:42,180
Speaking of which, i have
something you need to see.

465
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,220
After the spanish inquisition,

466
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:48,686
I was thinking we deserve
an extra-Long honeymoon.

467
00:34:48,797 --> 00:34:53,280
- So, maybe bora bora, st.Tropez?
- Chloe...

468
00:34:54,484 --> 00:34:57,400
Before you start booking anything,
there's something you need to know.

469
00:34:59,987 --> 00:35:02,588
As insane as that guy was,
he made a great point.

470
00:35:03,013 --> 00:35:07,384
If we're gonna make it, we can't
have any secrets from each other.

471
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:13,857
Yeah. It's that we don't have much
left to hide.

472
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,662
Yeah. There is.

473
00:35:20,882 --> 00:35:23,239
I'm not who you think i am.

474
00:35:26,804 --> 00:35:28,968
The sudden knot
in my stomach tells me

475
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:31,715
This isn't you embracing
your inner nietzsche.

476
00:35:35,411 --> 00:35:37,721
My parents aren't coming
to the wedding.

477
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:40,208
They...

478
00:35:41,396 --> 00:35:43,640
Well, they actually don't exist.

479
00:35:44,004 --> 00:35:47,769
Well, i mean, they do. Of course
they do. They exist. It's just that...

480
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:51,793
My dad's not an investment
banker in manhattan.

481
00:35:54,445 --> 00:35:58,069
He's a part-Time mechanic
and full-Time alcoholic in oklahoma city.

482
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:02,014
I never even really met my mom.

483
00:36:05,818 --> 00:36:08,541
Why would you keep something
like this from me?

484
00:36:12,056 --> 00:36:14,953
This city... it's huge.

485
00:36:14,954 --> 00:36:17,708
It's the top of the world
coming from where i come from.

486
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:20,115
And the only way
i could fit in was to...

487
00:36:21,732 --> 00:36:23,572
... be someone else.

488
00:36:26,873 --> 00:36:28,816
Why didn't you trust me?

489
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:33,048
I know.

490
00:36:33,732 --> 00:36:35,835
I'm sorry. I'm...

491
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:38,191
So sorry.

492
00:36:39,714 --> 00:36:41,527
I screwed up big-Time.

493
00:36:41,528 --> 00:36:44,827
And i totally understand if you
need some time or even if...

494
00:36:45,041 --> 00:36:46,863
If you want out.

495
00:36:49,392 --> 00:36:51,288
A guy like me...

496
00:36:52,638 --> 00:36:54,813
Doesn't get a girl like you, chloe.

497
00:36:57,706 --> 00:37:00,974
Life... it doesn't work like that.

498
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:07,781
Yeah, it does.

499
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:44,717
So much for breakfast in bed.

500
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:48,236
I'm late for a meeting in metropolis.

501
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:51,003
You know, some of us still have
corporations to run.

502
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:54,492
Oh, that's right. I forgot about that,
although i've got this really funny feeling

503
00:37:54,493 --> 00:37:56,905
That you could probably find
somebody else to answer your phones.

504
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:59,468
I'm thinking more like...

505
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:03,067
Dinner in malibu in time for the sunset.
What do you say?

506
00:38:04,492 --> 00:38:07,197
Is that a hint of romance i detect?

507
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:11,345
I can't stop myself.

508
00:38:22,787 --> 00:38:26,834
Save it, in case you want
to tip another hostess.

509
00:38:29,925 --> 00:38:32,789
There was nothing romantic
about last night, oliver.

510
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,812
I had an itch. You scratched it.

511
00:38:42,126 --> 00:38:43,961
Tess, what happened to you?

512
00:38:48,707 --> 00:38:50,545
I grew up.

513
00:38:51,953 --> 00:38:55,418
And you left right when things
started to get interesting.

514
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:59,010
You know the way out.

515
00:39:20,272 --> 00:39:22,526
You're not avoiding me, are you?

516
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,899
Me? Why would i be avoiding you?

517
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,303
I was just shopping for wedding
gifts for chloe and jimmy.

518
00:39:29,548 --> 00:39:32,036
So you're finally on board
with the happy couple.

519
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:36,950
Yep. All it took was them passing a madman's
electro-Cosmic death quiz,

520
00:39:36,951 --> 00:39:38,442
And i am sold.

521
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,044
In or out?

522
00:39:43,864 --> 00:39:47,732
You know, all things considered,
the stairs are better for cardio.

523
00:39:48,014 --> 00:39:51,395
Come on. Statistically,
this is the safer way to travel.

524
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:08,696
He confessed... the jeweler.

525
00:40:09,104 --> 00:40:11,179
I heard. Five couples?

526
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:19,631
So, about that test...

527
00:40:26,275 --> 00:40:28,772
Who would have thought
you were such a good liar, huh?

528
00:40:28,977 --> 00:40:31,681
You even beat that machine.

529
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:36,112
Even though i'm a natural master
of deception, i needed a little help.

530
00:40:36,113 --> 00:40:39,396
I mean, that machine was a piece
of kaiser-Era junk.

531
00:40:40,917 --> 00:40:44,147
Well, it did work the first time,
you know, when you electrocuted me.

532
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,064
Exactly.

533
00:40:47,753 --> 00:40:50,142
So while he was off
playing game-Show host,

534
00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:52,701
I slipped the sensor off my finger.

535
00:40:52,702 --> 00:40:54,361
Pretty crafty?

536
00:40:56,896 --> 00:40:59,112
So you weren't telling the truth.

537
00:41:00,854 --> 00:41:04,412
Please. I mean,
we do make a good team,

538
00:41:04,413 --> 00:41:07,305
But don't let our cover go
to that big old head of yours.

539
00:41:09,064 --> 00:41:10,660
I didn't.

540
00:41:12,526 --> 00:41:14,488
- Good.
- Great.

541
00:41:21,131 --> 00:41:24,512
Let's just be happy that i was
under the gun and not you.

542
00:41:24,684 --> 00:41:26,374
And why's that?

543
00:41:26,826 --> 00:41:29,784
Smallville, everyone knows
you're a terrible liar.

544
00:41:29,785 --> 00:41:32,657
Who knows where we'd be if you'd
answered that question?

545
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:43,933
