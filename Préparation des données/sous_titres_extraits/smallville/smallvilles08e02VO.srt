1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,606
Previously on "smallville"...

2
00:00:01,607 --> 00:00:03,887
- Who do you think you are?
- Tess mercer.

3
00:00:03,934 --> 00:00:06,169
I'm now the acting c.E.O.
Of luthorcorp

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:07,723
And all its subsidiaries.

5
00:00:07,724 --> 00:00:09,189
Will you marry me?

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,471
Don't move!

7
00:00:10,472 --> 00:00:12,176
Chloe sullivan,
you're under arrest.

8
00:00:12,177 --> 00:00:13,940
Jimmy, get clark!

9
00:00:13,941 --> 00:00:17,136
Chloe sullivan was never arrested
by the department of domestic security.

10
00:00:17,509 --> 00:00:21,058
He's got a research compound
in montana called black creek.

11
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:25,080
This was retrieved
from the excavation site.

12
00:00:25,081 --> 00:00:27,809
- And the montana facility?
- Completely dismantled.

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:29,828
And the guests
have been re-Assimilated.

14
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,148
I'm so glad you're okay.

15
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,379
Yes.

16
00:00:38,428 --> 00:00:41,940
I've been holding on to a life on
this farm that hasn't existed for years.

17
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,559
I'll see you bright and early
monday morning.

18
00:00:44,594 --> 00:00:47,026
You're looking at the newest
recruit tothe daily planet.

19
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:49,241
Looks like we're gonna be
neighbors, lane.

20
00:01:27,313 --> 00:01:30,590
Well, big points
for punctuality, smallville. But...

21
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:32,917
What's with
the wardrobe malfunction?

22
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:34,025
What?

23
00:01:35,017 --> 00:01:36,604
This is a nice shirt.

24
00:01:38,155 --> 00:01:40,606
Human resources is gonna be
down here any minute,

25
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:42,699
And you do not want to meet them
looking like...

26
00:01:42,706 --> 00:01:44,613
The brawny lumberjack.

27
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,257
Hold on.

28
00:01:51,689 --> 00:01:54,978
Hey! Personal space, lane!
Remember?

29
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:58,256
Gq here needs
some roadside assistance.

30
00:01:58,345 --> 00:02:00,002
Let me borrow your spare.

31
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:01,897
Come with me.

32
00:02:02,107 --> 00:02:03,884
Don't tell me
i have to wear a tie.

33
00:02:03,885 --> 00:02:06,088
Always dress for success.
No time for the men's room.

34
00:02:06,089 --> 00:02:07,493
Let's change in here.

35
00:02:07,698 --> 00:02:11,449
- A phone booth is not exactly pri...
- Burning daylight hours, clark! Change!

36
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,593
Lucky for you it's a slow
news day and i was at my desk.

37
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,297
Otherwise, you could have
spent your entire career

38
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:19,866
Being nicknamed "farm boy"
or "flannel man."

39
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:23,649
Trust me, the news game
can be brutal.

40
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,082
You do not want to bomb
on your first day. Hi.

41
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,528
So, how do i look?

42
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,289
Good.

43
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:52,857
So much for the slow news day.

44
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:54,665
Get out! Get out! Get out!

45
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:27,349
Get away from the bus.

46
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:02,801
Guess this must be
my stop.

47
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:11,497
Smallville 802

48
00:04:12,802 --> 00:04:18,457
Synchro : flolo

49
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:54,777
For seriessub.Com

50
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:28,868
Are you okay?

51
00:05:28,869 --> 00:05:31,157
Can somebody help us
over here, please?!

52
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,553
Over here!

53
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,783
- Was she on the bus?
- I don't know.

54
00:05:42,415 --> 00:05:45,166
I need you to, uh...
hold on to this for me.

55
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:46,685
What's your name?

56
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,205
Bette.

57
00:05:48,206 --> 00:05:51,405
You inhaled a lot of smoke, bette.
We're gonna give you a little fresh air.

58
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:53,766
Take slow,
deep breaths.

59
00:05:53,869 --> 00:05:55,773
Try to stay calm,
okay?

60
00:05:56,561 --> 00:05:59,345
I'm gonna check you over.
Tell me if anything hurts.

61
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,222
Just hang in there,
bette.

62
00:06:05,108 --> 00:06:06,488
It's okay.

63
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,069
You're doing great.

64
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:11,221
You too.

65
00:06:11,774 --> 00:06:13,558
Thank god you heard me.

66
00:06:14,143 --> 00:06:17,103
You were hard to miss. Look at me.

67
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:19,444
Well, bette, apart from
breathing in all that smoke,

68
00:06:19,445 --> 00:06:22,129
You're gonna be okay. We should still
get you to met general just to be sure.

69
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:23,616
You think you can make it
to my rig?

70
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:27,890
- Can you grab my bag?
- Yeah, of course.

71
00:06:27,891 --> 00:06:29,523
- Thanks, uh...
- Chloe.

72
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:32,846
Davis. You make a good wingman,
chloe... or wing person.

73
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:34,340
Thank you
for your help.

74
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,634
Straight to the hospital.

75
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,998
You're gonna be okay.

76
00:06:40,256 --> 00:06:41,543
You'll be all right.

77
00:06:41,544 --> 00:06:43,149
- Excuse me. Mind taking a look?
- Yeah.

78
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,166
There was a woman with red hair.

79
00:06:46,174 --> 00:06:48,174
I helped her get out of the bus,
and the paramedics took her.

80
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,282
Do you know if she's all right?

81
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:51,068
A lot of people
have been coming in and out,

82
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:53,137
But the most seriously injured
are at the hospital.

83
00:06:53,211 --> 00:06:54,563
You should try there.

84
00:06:54,564 --> 00:06:55,717
Thank you.

85
00:06:55,718 --> 00:06:57,205
Hey. Clark.

86
00:06:57,349 --> 00:06:58,621
Chloe?

87
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:01,662
- You all right?
- Yeah.

88
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:02,837
I just got here.

89
00:07:02,838 --> 00:07:05,188
I just helped this girl
who was on the bus.

90
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:07,261
- What happened?
- Well, i heard there was a bomb on the bus,

91
00:07:07,262 --> 00:07:08,961
But i haven't had a chance
to check it out.

92
00:07:09,378 --> 00:07:11,848
Even a dress shirt can't hide
the hero in you, huh, clark?

93
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:14,254
- Heck of a first day at the office.
- Well, that's why i'm there...

94
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:15,770
So i can be around
to help more people.

95
00:07:15,823 --> 00:07:19,054
Working at the daily planet, i'll hear
about every cris as it happens.

96
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:21,042
I just wish that
you were there with me.

97
00:07:21,381 --> 00:07:24,467
You know, now that lex
isn't running things...

98
00:07:24,468 --> 00:07:25,395
Yeah.

99
00:07:25,518 --> 00:07:28,955
I've spent almost my entire life
praying to the gods of journalism.

100
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,349
It might be kind of nice
to try something new, you know?

101
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,724
See how it feels.

102
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:34,530
Now you're ready for a change?

103
00:07:35,885 --> 00:07:37,594
Actually, uh...

104
00:07:38,198 --> 00:07:40,433
There's pretty big changes.

105
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,899
Apparently the goddess of journalism
is wondering where i am.

106
00:07:45,275 --> 00:07:47,569
With lois on the case,
it's gonna get harder

107
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,438
To duck away to save the day.

108
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:53,012
If i could hide my secret from you,
i think i can handle your cousin.

109
00:07:53,109 --> 00:07:54,714
Good luck with that.

110
00:07:55,468 --> 00:07:56,773
I got to go.

111
00:07:57,433 --> 00:08:00,180
Uh, tell lois that i said
to take it easy on you.

112
00:08:12,963 --> 00:08:15,357
Whoa, clark. What happened?
Are you okay?

113
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,292
Why? Were you worried about me?

114
00:08:17,293 --> 00:08:20,123
Uh, no. I'm trying to chase down
a lead on this story.

115
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,982
I don't want to have to
chase after you, too.

116
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,353
Hey, did you happen to hear anything
while you were out there

117
00:08:25,354 --> 00:08:27,311
- Making your ash angels?
- Actually, i did

118
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:30,544
The police think the bomb misfired
since there weren't any casualties.

119
00:08:30,545 --> 00:08:32,522
Didn't feel like a misfire
to me.

120
00:08:33,283 --> 00:08:35,452
All right. Who's your source?

121
00:08:37,217 --> 00:08:39,358
I'm sorry, lois. I didn't get a name.

122
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,944
I was too busy...
you know, helping people?

123
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,706
Rule number one...

124
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:46,901
Always know your source.

125
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:48,780
I understand.

126
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,942
Look, if you're gonna teach a class
on lois lane's rules of reporting,

127
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:54,774
I think i'd rather read
the cliff notes.

128
00:08:55,195 --> 00:08:57,111
Boss wants to
see you... now.

129
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:01,759
Okay, my first official meeting
with our latest leader.

130
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,269
Not you... kent.

131
00:09:05,734 --> 00:09:07,697
Well, you're gonna want
to clean yourself up.

132
00:09:07,823 --> 00:09:10,769
Uh, rule number two... always
make a good first impression

133
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,525
And don't screw up
with the boss.

134
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:15,202
I think
that's two rules.

135
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:17,215
Whatever.

136
00:09:17,216 --> 00:09:19,325
Try not to get fired
on your first day, okay?

137
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:33,174
Mr. Kent. Go right in.

138
00:09:37,305 --> 00:09:39,070
Have a seat, mr. Kent.

139
00:09:49,869 --> 00:09:52,948
Tess mercer,
acting c.E.O. Of luthorcorp.

140
00:09:53,735 --> 00:09:55,181
You're my boss?

141
00:09:55,287 --> 00:09:57,964
You weren't this shy when i was
the damsel in distress, kent.

142
00:09:58,549 --> 00:10:00,972
Don't tell me you're intimidated
by a powerful woman.

143
00:10:00,973 --> 00:10:04,114
No, i just... i'm surprised to see you
back at work so soon.

144
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:05,719
I have big shoes to fill.

145
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,616
And the paramedics said
that i was fine.

146
00:10:08,963 --> 00:10:10,578
It's unusual, isn't it...

147
00:10:10,579 --> 00:10:13,384
For the new c.E.O. Of luthorcorp
to be taking the bus to work?

148
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:15,061
I'm going green.

149
00:10:15,062 --> 00:10:17,540
You know, doing what i can
to save the planet.

150
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,569
But, for the sake
of the shareholders,

151
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,397
Let's keep that
between ourselves, hmm?

152
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,369
Seems we were destined
to meet.

153
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,612
I already had you
on my to-Do list today.

154
00:10:32,115 --> 00:10:34,434
Lex told me
all about you.

155
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,568
Well, not much to tell, really.

156
00:10:42,139 --> 00:10:44,843
He said you have a thing
for saving people?

157
00:10:45,124 --> 00:10:47,377
And after this morning,
i'd say that's true.

158
00:10:47,846 --> 00:10:49,987
Ever since
lex's disappearance,

159
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:53,109
I have used all of luthorcorp's
resources to find him.

160
00:10:53,138 --> 00:10:54,490
Do you have any leads?

161
00:10:54,491 --> 00:10:56,183
The world's a big place.

162
00:10:56,657 --> 00:10:59,425
I was hoping his good friend
could tell me where to look.

163
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:05,494
The lex luthor that i knew
disappeared years ago.

164
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:08,344
It's been a long time
since we were friends.

165
00:11:10,053 --> 00:11:11,950
I don't know
what happened to him.

166
00:11:14,252 --> 00:11:15,379
Fair enough.

167
00:11:16,819 --> 00:11:19,662
But if you do think
of something, please give me a call.

168
00:11:20,335 --> 00:11:21,791
And, clark...

169
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:25,428
You were extraordinary
out there.

170
00:11:26,828 --> 00:11:28,903
Thank you
for saving my life.

171
00:11:36,676 --> 00:11:39,624
I saw how this job
consumed lex's life.

172
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:43,181
I'd hate to see the same thing
happen to yours.

173
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:56,877
- Handsome.
- And a liar.

174
00:11:57,056 --> 00:11:58,557
He's hiding something.

175
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,208
I'll have someone
watch him.

176
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:04,079
No. I'll keep an eye
on this one personally.

177
00:12:25,643 --> 00:12:26,835
Hi.

178
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:28,125
Doc says i'm okay,

179
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:30,913
But i feel like i just threw
down with a carton of cloves.

180
00:12:30,914 --> 00:12:32,251
Well, i figured
you'd be hungry,

181
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:34,066
So, unfortunately,
it's meat-Loaf mondays,

182
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,730
But i did score you
some curly fries.

183
00:12:35,731 --> 00:12:38,780
Are you kidding? Hot food's good
any day of the week.

184
00:12:38,889 --> 00:12:40,091
Thanks.

185
00:12:40,603 --> 00:12:43,630
I, uh, i'm surprised
your parents aren't... here.

186
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,420
Look, it's really cool what
you did for me and everything,

187
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:51,117
But it doesn't mean i have
to tell you my life story.

188
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:53,678
I wasn't asking.

189
00:12:55,915 --> 00:12:57,956
I haven't seen them
in years.

190
00:12:57,957 --> 00:13:01,151
I'm kind of in between homes
right now.

191
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:08,027
You know, why don't i grab you
a soda to wash that down?

192
00:13:16,101 --> 00:13:18,190
- Davis. Hi.
- How's she doing?

193
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:20,349
Uh, she got
a clean bill of health.

194
00:13:20,763 --> 00:13:24,238
But, um, i just found out
that she's a street kid.

195
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,816
So i was gonna drop her off
at the city shelter tonight.

196
00:13:29,623 --> 00:13:31,719
She's a 15-Year-Old girl,
chloe.

197
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,198
You really think she's gonna be safe
at the metropolis shelter?

198
00:13:34,297 --> 00:13:36,110
Not too streetwise,
are you?

199
00:13:36,238 --> 00:13:38,088
I was just trying
to help.

200
00:13:38,553 --> 00:13:42,743
If you have any ideas,
please, step up. Do something.

201
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:55,075
So, i hear that you need
a place to stay?

202
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,491
Not really.

203
00:14:03,805 --> 00:14:06,115
But if you did,
i have a friend,

204
00:14:06,116 --> 00:14:08,613
And she runs a home,
and it's pretty nice.

205
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:12,010
Is she some kind of religious nut?
'Cause i don't really roll with the holy.

206
00:14:12,011 --> 00:14:15,462
It's not like that. She helps girls learn
some skills, score a job.

207
00:14:15,463 --> 00:14:17,077
I can get you
an application.

208
00:14:17,738 --> 00:14:20,479
Or... you can forget it.
It's your choice.

209
00:14:21,765 --> 00:14:24,481
Look, bette, you can
stay with me tonight if you need to.

210
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:30,398
You're nice, chloe.
Kind of like a girl scout.

211
00:14:30,429 --> 00:14:32,786
I don't want to be
your latest merit badge.

212
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:37,117
I'm gonna take my thin mints
and head home.

213
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:39,756
I thought you might want
a safe place to stay tonight.

214
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,053
But would i still be
a free agent?

215
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:47,692
As long as you promise
to think about davis' offer.

216
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:54,429
Okay, i'm in.

217
00:14:54,895 --> 00:14:56,360
Great. Let's go.

218
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,706
That new boss, she really
came out of nowhere, huh?

219
00:15:04,767 --> 00:15:07,556
You tell me. You're the one who just spent
quality time with her.

220
00:15:07,614 --> 00:15:09,685
She just wanted
to welcome me aboard.

221
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:12,045
Don't try to keep secrets
from me, clark.

222
00:15:12,046 --> 00:15:13,744
Tess mercer is
a pit bull in prada.

223
00:15:13,745 --> 00:15:15,525
There's no way she'd roll out
the welcome mat

224
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:18,157
For a copyboy, no matter
how charming his smile is.

225
00:15:18,158 --> 00:15:19,580
You think i have
a charming smile?

226
00:15:19,886 --> 00:15:23,384
I think you're about to lose some teeth
if you don't tell me what she said.

227
00:15:23,385 --> 00:15:25,434
Lois, you sound like
a jealous girlfriend.

228
00:15:25,435 --> 00:15:27,623
Jealous. Of you?

229
00:15:27,624 --> 00:15:31,320
Please, that would be like willie mays
being jealous of a batboy.

230
00:15:32,295 --> 00:15:33,863
Watch and learn.

231
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,213
Hi.

232
00:15:39,757 --> 00:15:42,057
Lois lane...
daily planet.

233
00:15:42,229 --> 00:15:44,804
- Care to show me around?
- No press allowed.

234
00:15:50,401 --> 00:15:51,925
Swing and a miss?

235
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,667
I'm just getting started.

236
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,312
Excuse me.

237
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:03,417
Do you like baseball?

238
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,124
Who's your
favorite player?

239
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,501
Because i can get you a signed
photograph of anyone you want

240
00:16:08,502 --> 00:16:10,479
If you just do me
this little favor.

241
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,413
Sorry, ma'am.
No one's allowed in.

242
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:14,470
What's your name,
officer?

243
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,133
Officer derek.

244
00:16:19,073 --> 00:16:20,677
It's got to be
a mistake.

245
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,085
No mistake, sir.

246
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:24,468
We haven't found one shred
of explosive material.

247
00:16:24,514 --> 00:16:27,433
No residue. There's no
detonator. There's nothing.

248
00:16:27,434 --> 00:16:29,105
I'm telling you...
there was no bomb on that bus.

249
00:16:29,106 --> 00:16:30,570
Wake up, smallville.

250
00:16:30,571 --> 00:16:32,769
Our cop's about as stiff
as his starched uniform.

251
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,849
- Let's move on.
- Lois

252
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,746
I just heard
there was no bomb.

253
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,458
That doesn't look like
the engine overheating.

254
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,667
Look, we need to talk
to somebody who was on the bus.

255
00:16:45,506 --> 00:16:48,586
Chloe called. She's helping
a homeless girl who was there.

256
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:50,886
Maybe you could ask her what she saw,
and i'll track down the others.

257
00:16:50,887 --> 00:16:52,715
The thing is,
not so good with the kids.

258
00:16:52,716 --> 00:16:54,883
Why don't you take little orphan annie
and i'll do the rest?

259
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:07,788
Bette!

260
00:17:07,945 --> 00:17:09,410
Thank you so much.

261
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:11,627
It's just a grilled cheese.
No big.

262
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:14,347
All this take-Out, i thought you could use
something home-Cooked.

263
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,825
It's okay. It's just my friend clark.
Don't worry about it.

264
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:22,050
What's up?

265
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:25,375
Wait. I remember you.
You helped me get off the bus.

266
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:27,266
Yeah, i'm glad
you're okay, bette.

267
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,867
Do you mind if i ask you
a few questions?

268
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,971
Did you see anything
before the blast?

269
00:17:32,972 --> 00:17:35,530
Anything unusual?
Anything strange?

270
00:17:36,307 --> 00:17:38,824
- What are you, like a cop or something?
- Clark,

271
00:17:39,462 --> 00:17:41,884
She's been through a lot today.
What's going on?

272
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:44,085
The police say
there's no evidence of a bomb.

273
00:17:44,434 --> 00:17:47,621
I think someone with a meteor power
may have caused the blast.

274
00:17:49,742 --> 00:17:51,423
What's a meteor power?

275
00:17:52,828 --> 00:17:56,705
Uh, sometimes,
people develop special abilities

276
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,591
After being exposed to
a certain type of meteor rock.

277
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:01,606
Tommy.

278
00:18:02,447 --> 00:18:04,240
Another street kid.

279
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:06,981
He told me he found this
weird rock a couple days ago,

280
00:18:06,982 --> 00:18:10,127
And now whenever he gets angry,
things heat up.

281
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,610
I thought
he was messing with me.

282
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,304
We got into a fight today.

283
00:18:14,305 --> 00:18:17,307
He was being a jerk, so i ran on
to the bus to get away from him.

284
00:18:17,308 --> 00:18:19,815
- Do you know where i can find him?
- I know where he hangs.

285
00:18:19,816 --> 00:18:21,259
I think i can remember
how to get there.

286
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:24,204
Wait, bette. This guy sounds
dangerous. I don't think you should go.

287
00:18:24,382 --> 00:18:27,427
Well, i'll wait in the car.
I can point him out to you.

288
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:39,094
He's over there,
sitting down.

289
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:42,511
I saw him earlier.

290
00:18:42,563 --> 00:18:44,225
He was running away
from the bus.

291
00:18:49,816 --> 00:18:51,195
Tommy!

292
00:18:52,884 --> 00:18:54,780
It's all right.
I just want to talk.

293
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,980
Tommy, it's okay.

294
00:19:00,246 --> 00:19:01,562
Stay here!

295
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:05,715
Tommy!

296
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,259
Tommy!

297
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:10,502
- Don't be afraid!
- Get away from me!

298
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:13,653
It'll be okay, tommy.
I promise.

299
00:19:13,654 --> 00:19:15,777
No! No!
No, you're lying!

300
00:19:15,778 --> 00:19:18,130
Just be calm, all right? There's no
reason for anyone to get hurt.

301
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:19,638
Get away from me!

302
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:21,565
Bette, stay back.
It could be dangerous.

303
00:19:22,136 --> 00:19:24,071
How could you
do this to me?!

304
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,056
Just stay away
from me, okay?!

305
00:19:31,195 --> 00:19:32,408
Tommy!

306
00:19:46,403 --> 00:19:47,981
He was scared, lois.

307
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:49,851
I don't think
he meant to hurt anyone.

308
00:19:49,852 --> 00:19:51,526
He just couldn't control
his powers.

309
00:19:51,527 --> 00:19:54,692
He blew up a bus, clark,
almost killed a lot of people.

310
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,726
I'd say
this was textbook karma.

311
00:20:00,317 --> 00:20:01,371
Thanks.

312
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:03,843
Hey, you didn't tell me
that you were recording that.

313
00:20:03,844 --> 00:20:05,755
Don't get your tights
in a twist, smallville.

314
00:20:05,756 --> 00:20:07,801
I'll just refer to you
as "sources say."

315
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:10,082
Besides, if i'm gonna write
"tommy was a human bomb,"

316
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,437
I need scientific proof.

317
00:20:12,503 --> 00:20:14,334
We could check
the autopsy report,

318
00:20:14,335 --> 00:20:16,175
See how much meteor rock
was in his system.

319
00:20:16,176 --> 00:20:19,475
The coroner won't release it if it's part
of an on going investigation.

320
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:24,669
But i bet we could find a copy
lying around the hospital.

321
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:27,442
By "find,"
i'm assuming you mean "steal."

322
00:20:27,443 --> 00:20:30,447
Rule number three... do whatever
it takes to get the story.

323
00:20:30,448 --> 00:20:32,276
You really should be
writing these down.

324
00:20:32,277 --> 00:20:34,546
Lois, be careful. There's some lines
you shouldn't cross.

325
00:20:34,547 --> 00:20:37,606
The only line
i'm worried about is a byline.

326
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:39,204
And so should you, clark.
We're in this together.

327
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,900
You want to share a byline
with me?

328
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:42,110
Oh, god, no.

329
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,017
But i got you the obit.

330
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,824
Tommy's obituary?

331
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,799
Absolutely. You helped
break the story,

332
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,531
So you get to commemorate
the kid in 10 lines or less.

333
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:55,127
Don't be so squeamish. Most of us
got started writing want ads.

334
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,509
You know what there was a time
when i would have killed for an obit.

335
00:21:00,277 --> 00:21:01,967
Are you coming?

336
00:21:14,853 --> 00:21:16,299
Shoot.

337
00:21:18,714 --> 00:21:21,691
You know, if you just reach
a little bit higher,

338
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,884
You'd definitely need
an ambulance.

339
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:26,255
Guess i'm lucky there's
a paramedic in the building.

340
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:30,135
Yeah, well, you asked me
to bring over this application.

341
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:35,908
Gimme.

342
00:21:36,999 --> 00:21:39,070
Oh, i did talk
to my friend.

343
00:21:39,399 --> 00:21:43,294
And she says that there's a spot
open at the home for bette.

344
00:21:44,601 --> 00:21:45,943
That's great!

345
00:21:49,752 --> 00:21:52,588
She could really use
some good news right now.

346
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:55,478
Her day got even worse
a little while ago,

347
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,866
And she needed some space,
so i came here.

348
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:05,506
Thank you.

349
00:22:05,668 --> 00:22:07,621
At least she had a place
to stay, thanks to you.

350
00:22:10,459 --> 00:22:11,717
Thanks.

351
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,834
Isis foundation. So, what...

352
00:22:18,835 --> 00:22:21,567
Adopt a pyramid, save a sphinx,
that kind of thing?

353
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:23,163
Cute.

354
00:22:23,252 --> 00:22:26,005
Uh, actually, it's more like
a counseling center.

355
00:22:26,006 --> 00:22:29,009
I'm housesitting for a friend of mine
till she finds someone to take it over.

356
00:22:29,205 --> 00:22:32,344
I'm surprised i haven't heard of it.
The hospital sends out updates

357
00:22:32,345 --> 00:22:34,004
On all the mental-Health
facilities.

358
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,610
Well... she has
very specific clients...

359
00:22:36,736 --> 00:22:39,572
People with special skills
that are sometimes

360
00:22:39,605 --> 00:22:41,367
A little dangerous.

361
00:22:41,368 --> 00:22:43,667
What, you mean like...
meteor types?

362
00:22:44,698 --> 00:22:47,994
I drive an ambulance in metropolis, chloe.
I've seen a lot of things...

363
00:22:47,995 --> 00:22:50,407
At least enough to know
that they could use the help.

364
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:54,990
Have you ever thought
about helping them?

365
00:22:55,399 --> 00:22:56,759
No, i don't...

366
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,270
I saw you with bette today.

367
00:22:58,271 --> 00:23:01,079
You cared enough to take her
under your wing. That's rare.

368
00:23:01,678 --> 00:23:04,975
And think how hard it must be
for these meteor people

369
00:23:04,976 --> 00:23:06,631
To find someone
they can trust.

370
00:23:06,903 --> 00:23:08,866
But am i
streetwise enough?

371
00:23:09,101 --> 00:23:11,455
Okay, forget
what i said earlier.

372
00:23:11,456 --> 00:23:13,899
I can come off
a little strong.

373
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,043
It's okay. At least now i
understand where it comes from.

374
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,284
Understand how?

375
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,740
Well, i googled you.

376
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:23,479
And i read an interview
that you gave

377
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,375
About running away
from foster homes as a kid.

378
00:23:25,376 --> 00:23:27,014
You researched me?

379
00:23:28,584 --> 00:23:31,363
Well, you know, i always
kind of wanted my own stalker.

380
00:23:31,439 --> 00:23:33,233
No.
It isn't like that, davis.

381
00:23:33,234 --> 00:23:35,991
It's just that... no, really,
i used to be a reporter,

382
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:39,862
And so i have a serious...
curiosity complex.

383
00:23:41,097 --> 00:23:42,455
And i'm engaged.

384
00:23:45,574 --> 00:23:47,912
You're the first person
i've told about that.

385
00:23:47,957 --> 00:23:50,126
Well, um,
congratulations.

386
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:53,102
That's... a very unique
engagement ring.

387
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:56,622
Uh, well, you know,
it's the story behind the ring

388
00:23:56,623 --> 00:23:58,162
That really
makes it special.

389
00:23:58,802 --> 00:24:01,796
I went away for a little while,
and he never gave up on me.

390
00:24:04,207 --> 00:24:08,470
Well, chloe, i grew up hearing
a lot of four-Letter words,

391
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:10,906
And "love" wasn't exactly
one of them.

392
00:24:11,455 --> 00:24:14,159
If you found it,
real love,

393
00:24:15,667 --> 00:24:17,263
Hold on to it.

394
00:24:22,945 --> 00:24:26,737
And if anyone tells you that's a cliché,
i'll personally kick their ass.

395
00:25:00,543 --> 00:25:02,174
Did you find her?

396
00:25:02,175 --> 00:25:03,923
She's gone off the grid
again.

397
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,426
Don't come back
until you do.

398
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:15,927
- Is there something else?
- The girl's dangerous.

399
00:25:15,928 --> 00:25:18,715
You tried to approach her
on the bus, and she blew it up.

400
00:25:19,298 --> 00:25:22,594
Mr. Luthor would have had us
terminate the problem on-Site.

401
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:26,391
I'm your boss now.

402
00:25:26,495 --> 00:25:28,423
And since
we've never worked together,

403
00:25:28,424 --> 00:25:31,209
I can't trust that you'll see
this through to my satisfaction.

404
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:34,662
Bring her here.
I'll handle her.

405
00:25:35,647 --> 00:25:37,087
End of story.

406
00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:55,743
Lois, you can't just walk in
and steal a file.

407
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:57,521
It's a crime.
You'll go to prison.

408
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,158
I have a plan, clark.

409
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,390
Would you like to share it?
'Cause i'm having doubts.

410
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:03,753
When in doubt...

411
00:26:04,216 --> 00:26:05,549
Charge it.

412
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,625
City hall... 13th precinct...
15th precinct...

413
00:26:10,414 --> 00:26:12,179
Metropolis general.

414
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:17,224
If i could just get mileage points
on these things, i'd see the world.

415
00:26:17,225 --> 00:26:19,066
Cover me, smallville.

416
00:26:30,475 --> 00:26:33,844
Uh, you know, patients are
on an entirely different floor.

417
00:26:33,845 --> 00:26:36,390
You know, i thought i got off
the elevator a little early.

418
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:40,564
Wait. You're one of the rescue workers
from the bus, right?

419
00:26:40,696 --> 00:26:42,630
I thought
i recognized you.

420
00:26:42,631 --> 00:26:45,344
For a guy without a uniform,
you helped a lot of people.

421
00:26:45,345 --> 00:26:46,720
Oh, i didn't do anything.

422
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:49,190
I mean,
you're the real hero.

423
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,945
You help people
for a living.

424
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,608
I'm clark kent.

425
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:55,534
Davis bloome.
I met your fiancée.

426
00:26:55,535 --> 00:26:58,246
Clark, congratulations.
She's a real catch.

427
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:00,024
I'm getting married?

428
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:03,560
Well, i thought that... 'cause
i saw you and chloe together,

429
00:27:03,561 --> 00:27:05,485
And you seemed pretty close.
When she said she was engaged...

430
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:06,987
Chloe's engaged?

431
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:10,863
Oh, man. Okay, my brain's
gone completely d.O.A.

432
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:13,447
Clark, she said
she hadn't told anyone yet.

433
00:27:13,911 --> 00:27:17,679
Do me a favor.
Don't tell her i said anything.

434
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,761
I won't reveal my source.

435
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,050
Hey, bette!

436
00:27:29,051 --> 00:27:31,057
Davis, the paramedic
we met on the street,

437
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:32,944
Came by
with the paperwork.

438
00:27:32,945 --> 00:27:34,529
His friends
want to meet you.

439
00:27:34,571 --> 00:27:37,454
Change of plan, chloe.
I'm leaving metropolis.

440
00:27:37,455 --> 00:27:39,481
Don't you think that
you should read this first?

441
00:27:39,482 --> 00:27:41,438
I mean, this place
sounds really great.

442
00:27:41,439 --> 00:27:44,198
Maybe it is,
but this city's gone sour...

443
00:27:44,199 --> 00:27:45,913
Like, way past
its shelf life.

444
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,090
I have to go.

445
00:27:47,091 --> 00:27:49,200
Look, i know what happened
with tommy was awful,

446
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:51,346
But running away
is not the answer.

447
00:27:51,489 --> 00:27:54,944
Besides, it's not safe out there
for you by yourself.

448
00:27:54,945 --> 00:27:56,700
You think the streets
are dangerous?

449
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:59,339
Try a locked door with
someone else holding the key.

450
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,359
- No, thanks.
- They're not gonna lock you in.

451
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,981
Look, tell you what...
i'll call them for you.

452
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,158
Chloe, stop.

453
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,699
I don't need a den mother,
and i won't go see those people.

454
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,060
Then they'll come here
to see you.

455
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,404
You're not listening
to me!

456
00:28:09,405 --> 00:28:10,995
I'm just trying
to help you, bette.

457
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:19,573
I wish you hadn't
made me do that.

458
00:28:31,672 --> 00:28:34,067
There's nothing in here
about a meteor infection.

459
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:35,678
Here.
Let me take a look.

460
00:28:35,902 --> 00:28:37,470
Knock yourself out.

461
00:28:37,471 --> 00:28:39,376
I'm not sure we're
on the right track, lois.

462
00:28:39,377 --> 00:28:41,160
Tommy's death
seems suspicious.

463
00:28:41,161 --> 00:28:42,298
Of course
it's suspicious.

464
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,879
The guy blew himself up just by
rubbing his hands together

465
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,418
Or wrinkling his nose
or whatever he did.

466
00:28:46,419 --> 00:28:48,185
They didn't find
any meteor rock in his system,

467
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:50,144
But they did find metal shrapnel
from the barrels.

468
00:28:50,157 --> 00:28:52,598
Lois, if tommy's responsible
for the blast,

469
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,298
Then the barrels would have
blown away from him,

470
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,482
Not into him, right?

471
00:28:55,483 --> 00:28:57,061
Don't clear his name
just yet, sherlock.

472
00:28:57,062 --> 00:28:59,042
That kid was dangerous,
a real live wire.

473
00:28:59,043 --> 00:29:00,526
Check his rap sheet
at the back.

474
00:29:00,527 --> 00:29:02,938
Armed robbery, b&e,
and carjacking.

475
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:05,713
Basically, that firecracker was
a major menace to metropolis.

476
00:29:05,714 --> 00:29:08,493
But there's no mention
of explosives in any of these crimes, lois.

477
00:29:08,494 --> 00:29:11,296
If you were a criminal
with these abilities,
wouldn't you use them?

478
00:29:11,435 --> 00:29:13,810
Well, if tommy didn't
kill himself, then who did?

479
00:29:14,441 --> 00:29:16,296
Bette claimed that tommy
blew up the bus.

480
00:29:18,238 --> 00:29:20,013
But she was there
for both of the blasts.

481
00:29:21,183 --> 00:29:24,240
Oh, my god. My cousin's
babysitting psycho spice.

482
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:28,104
Clark, what if...

483
00:29:29,624 --> 00:29:30,817
Oh, come on.

484
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:34,282
Believe me,
i understand.

485
00:29:34,623 --> 00:29:36,255
It can be tough
to control your powers

486
00:29:36,256 --> 00:29:38,153
When you're angry
or afraid...

487
00:29:38,535 --> 00:29:41,948
Like on the bus
or...with tommy.

488
00:29:41,949 --> 00:29:43,713
Those weren't accidents!

489
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:45,748
I knew what i was doing!

490
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,704
There are some bad people
chasing me.

491
00:29:48,705 --> 00:29:51,569
They cornered me on the bus.
I had to fight back.

492
00:29:51,883 --> 00:29:54,353
So you set up tommy
to take the blame?

493
00:29:55,655 --> 00:29:56,480
Bette...

494
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,454
You killed him.

495
00:29:59,064 --> 00:30:00,649
He helped them find me.

496
00:30:02,288 --> 00:30:03,232
Three years ago,

497
00:30:03,233 --> 00:30:05,934
Some corporate types locked me
in their private prison.

498
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,418
It was a nightmare.
They ran tests on me every day.

499
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,842
Last week, something happened,
and we were all let go.

500
00:30:15,218 --> 00:30:16,978
They tagged us
on the way out.

501
00:30:17,853 --> 00:30:20,144
I ran before they could
do it to me.

502
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:22,962
This place... were there lots
of people there with powers?

503
00:30:22,972 --> 00:30:24,041
Yeah.

504
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,177
I told tommy
all about it.

505
00:30:26,538 --> 00:30:30,053
And you know what he did?
He sold me out.

506
00:30:30,498 --> 00:30:32,314
He led them
straight to me.

507
00:30:32,676 --> 00:30:34,130
He got
what he deserved.

508
00:30:35,826 --> 00:30:37,882
The prison was in montana,
wasn't it?

509
00:30:37,883 --> 00:30:39,056
Black creek?

510
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,848
How did you know that?

511
00:30:43,776 --> 00:30:45,618
Because i was there.

512
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:50,130
I had a meteor power, too.
I could heal people.

513
00:30:50,131 --> 00:30:51,907
I know
how awful it was there.

514
00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:54,154
Then you know i had to do
whatever it took to get away.

515
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:56,159
They had me
backed into a corner.

516
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,840
No matter what they do to you,
bette, you don't kill people.

517
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:03,674
Sometimes
i don't have a choice!

518
00:31:04,421 --> 00:31:06,111
Chloe, i'm sorry,

519
00:31:06,484 --> 00:31:08,775
But i can't risk you
turning on me, too.

520
00:31:13,974 --> 00:31:15,242
Goodbye, chloe!

521
00:31:17,724 --> 00:31:18,581
No!

522
00:31:37,277 --> 00:31:39,531
Stay away from me!
I'll hurt you!

523
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,610
No. You won't.

524
00:31:42,178 --> 00:31:43,575
You're not afraid of me?

525
00:31:43,689 --> 00:31:44,650
No.

526
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:47,027
I just want to help you.

527
00:31:47,855 --> 00:31:49,787
After everything
i've done,

528
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:52,667
Why would you want to help
a monster like me?

529
00:31:52,903 --> 00:31:54,411
Because you're not
a monster.

530
00:31:54,984 --> 00:31:57,042
You've just been led
down the wrong path.

531
00:31:59,452 --> 00:32:01,584
Whenever people find out
about me,

532
00:32:01,955 --> 00:32:04,163
They get afraid
and they try to hurt me.

533
00:32:05,306 --> 00:32:08,024
So i have to lie.
I have to hide what i am.

534
00:32:10,693 --> 00:32:12,122
You don't have to anymore.

535
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:14,698
Not from me.

536
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:28,683
We all have something
we think we need to hide.

537
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:32,168
It's hard.

538
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,682
But it does get better.

539
00:32:49,686 --> 00:32:51,274
It's a good thing
you called lois

540
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:52,700
And told her
you were okay.

541
00:32:52,908 --> 00:32:55,058
She was about to call out
the national guard.

542
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,190
Bette almost killed me,
clark.

543
00:33:01,693 --> 00:33:04,886
Chloe, there's no way
you could have known
how dangerous she was.

544
00:33:04,887 --> 00:33:06,250
Her power was hidden.

545
00:33:07,096 --> 00:33:09,163
Some sort of
high-Frequency energy blast?

546
00:33:09,164 --> 00:33:10,580
She fooled everyone.

547
00:33:10,581 --> 00:33:12,490
That's because
she didn't trust anyone.

548
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:14,850
I mean, i was only in that cell
for a few weeks.

549
00:33:14,851 --> 00:33:18,006
I can't imagine being in there
for three years.

550
00:33:18,423 --> 00:33:20,737
Hopefully, she'll find the help
she needs at belle reve.

551
00:33:20,738 --> 00:33:22,998
Yeah, i seriously doubt
that being locked away

552
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:24,728
In another cell
is gonna do any good.

553
00:33:26,161 --> 00:33:27,845
Do you think
if you knew her sooner,

554
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:29,467
You could have helped her
deal with her power?

555
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:31,496
Chloe, sometimes people
who need help the most

556
00:33:31,497 --> 00:33:33,609
Are the ones
who push it away the hardest.

557
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:36,567
Which is why someone
should be talking to
them from day one.

558
00:33:44,328 --> 00:33:45,494
Looking for this?

559
00:33:47,803 --> 00:33:49,054
I found it downstairs.

560
00:33:49,055 --> 00:33:51,455
You must have lost it
when bette was chasing you.

561
00:33:56,856 --> 00:33:58,658
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

562
00:33:59,359 --> 00:34:00,740
I was...

563
00:34:01,158 --> 00:34:04,101
On my over here this morning
to tell you, but...

564
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:09,538
How did you find out?
Did jimmy call you?

565
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:14,552
Well,
it's rule number... 11...

566
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,158
Always protect
your source.

567
00:34:19,661 --> 00:34:22,104
But i would like
the whole story.

568
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:25,880
How long
have you been engaged?

569
00:34:27,743 --> 00:34:29,183
A week.

570
00:34:29,626 --> 00:34:32,456
I said "yes" the night
i came back from montana.

571
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:38,030
You could have called...
anytime.

572
00:34:39,538 --> 00:34:41,065
It's just that...

573
00:34:42,681 --> 00:34:45,855
We've been friends
for such a long time.

574
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:48,000
We're more
than just friends, chloe.

575
00:34:52,985 --> 00:34:54,976
When jimmy and i
get married,

576
00:34:55,805 --> 00:34:58,181
Things will
probably change...

577
00:34:58,717 --> 00:35:00,176
Between us, i mean.

578
00:35:03,616 --> 00:35:06,165
And i don't know if i'm ready
for that just yet.

579
00:35:08,169 --> 00:35:09,376
Are you?

580
00:35:15,963 --> 00:35:17,587
I know that your happiness

581
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:19,512
Is one of the most important
things in the world to me...

582
00:35:20,472 --> 00:35:22,970
And that you and jimmy will have
a wonderful life together.

583
00:35:29,063 --> 00:35:30,998
Don't worry
about anything else.

584
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:07,216
Hello, bette.

585
00:36:09,432 --> 00:36:12,012
You should have died
on that bus.

586
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,177
The last time we met,
things did get a little fiery.

587
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:19,883
Lucky for me, i ducked.

588
00:36:22,925 --> 00:36:25,807
So, they're taking you
to belle reve.

589
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:29,304
I'm sure after a few years
of good behavior,

590
00:36:29,305 --> 00:36:30,891
They'll let you
see the sun again.

591
00:36:31,905 --> 00:36:33,755
Or you could come
with me.

592
00:36:34,686 --> 00:36:36,328
I'd rather
be a prisoner there

593
00:36:36,329 --> 00:36:38,392
Than your lab rat
in montana.

594
00:36:38,957 --> 00:36:40,888
Go push your cheese
somewhere else.

595
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,641
I didn't build
that place, bette.

596
00:36:53,769 --> 00:36:56,686
And after i heard about
all the terrible things
happening there,

597
00:36:56,952 --> 00:36:58,521
I closed it down.

598
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:00,626
I tried to tell you.

599
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:02,904
If you shut down
the thunderdome,

600
00:37:02,905 --> 00:37:05,137
Then why are you still
coming after me?

601
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,140
Because you're
a very powerful person.

602
00:37:12,267 --> 00:37:14,311
And i think
it's about time

603
00:37:14,312 --> 00:37:15,752
The world started
treating you accordingly.

604
00:37:16,189 --> 00:37:17,712
Don't you?

605
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:20,344
Listening.

606
00:37:21,947 --> 00:37:26,096
I want to introduce you...
to some people like you.

607
00:37:27,275 --> 00:37:28,834
A sort of team.

608
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:31,317
But only if you want.

609
00:37:31,627 --> 00:37:34,424
A team?
Take a look at my file, lady.

610
00:37:34,425 --> 00:37:36,194
I don't play well
with others.

611
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:40,495
I think once you meet everyone,
you may finally feel like you it in.

612
00:37:42,017 --> 00:37:44,721
I remember what it was like
to be your age...

613
00:37:45,312 --> 00:37:46,679
Alone...

614
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:48,787
Angry...

615
00:37:50,242 --> 00:37:51,262
Trapped.

616
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,623
The injustice of it all.

617
00:37:56,462 --> 00:37:58,452
I can help, bette.

618
00:38:02,387 --> 00:38:04,711
A team is only as good
as its weakest link.

619
00:38:05,718 --> 00:38:08,037
And look what happened to me
on the bus.

620
00:38:09,232 --> 00:38:10,807
Why scout out somebody

621
00:38:10,808 --> 00:38:12,845
Who's just gonna choke
on their own smoke?

622
00:38:13,761 --> 00:38:16,165
Don't be so hard
on yourself.

623
00:38:20,755 --> 00:38:23,150
We'll make a hero
out of you yet.

624
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,280
Looking good, smallville.

625
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,718
Clothes make the man who helped
me make the front page.

626
00:38:49,305 --> 00:38:51,643
Wow. Try to hold back
the journalistic fervor.

627
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:53,661
I'm glad you got
your story, lois,

628
00:38:53,662 --> 00:38:55,592
But it took a few more turns
than i would have liked.

629
00:38:55,593 --> 00:38:58,217
So did you, houdini. You're there one minute,
gone the next.

630
00:38:58,218 --> 00:38:59,505
We were standing
next to an elevator.

631
00:38:59,506 --> 00:39:00,737
I don't know why
you had to take the stairs.

632
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:02,993
Well, i'm sorry
that you can't keep up.

633
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,520
The important thing is

634
00:39:04,521 --> 00:39:06,861
That chloe figured it out
on her own and she's okay.

635
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,496
Yeah, tell me about it.

636
00:39:08,497 --> 00:39:10,834
If she hadn't defused
little miss land mine,

637
00:39:10,873 --> 00:39:13,371
We'd be fitting her for a coffin
instead of a wedding dress.

638
00:39:14,765 --> 00:39:16,425
When did you hear
about the wedding?

639
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,041
She just called.

640
00:39:18,712 --> 00:39:20,900
I can't believe
my cousin is getting married.

641
00:39:21,456 --> 00:39:22,952
To jimmy olsen.

642
00:39:24,516 --> 00:39:27,721
They're in love, lois.
You should be happy for them.

643
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:31,864
Well, at least
the rest of us have work.

644
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,111
Here. I finished
proofing the obit.

645
00:39:36,921 --> 00:39:39,084
Wow, lois.
Don't hold anything back.

646
00:39:39,215 --> 00:39:41,312
Those aren't notes
of discouragement.

647
00:39:41,313 --> 00:39:42,448
They're notes
of encouragement.

648
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,052
You've got talent,
smallville.

649
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:45,353
What?

650
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:48,104
Look, when i first srted out
at the inquisitor,

651
00:39:48,105 --> 00:39:51,296
All i cared about was
getting the best stories
on the front page.

652
00:39:51,297 --> 00:39:53,155
Well, it seems like
a dream come true.

653
00:39:53,823 --> 00:39:56,920
Sure, but sitting here now
with you,

654
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:59,520
I think i'm more proud
that we uncovered the truth

655
00:39:59,528 --> 00:40:01,331
Than i am
over having a headline.

656
00:40:06,512 --> 00:40:08,616
Thanks for helping me
break the story, clark.

657
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:13,938
Keep up the good work.

658
00:40:14,352 --> 00:40:17,033
You've got a long career ahead
of you at the daily planet.

659
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:51,992
Hey, this is davis.
Leave me your story.

660
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:53,133
I'll call you back.

661
00:40:54,282 --> 00:40:57,034
Hi, davis.
It's chloe sullivan.

662
00:40:57,035 --> 00:41:00,713
I, uh, i just wanted
to call and say thanks

663
00:41:00,714 --> 00:41:02,497
For helping out with bette.

664
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:06,206
It's too bad that
that didn't, uh, work out.

665
00:41:06,207 --> 00:41:08,568
But i also wanted
to let you know

666
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:12,220
That i've decided
to reopen the isis foundation,

667
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:15,073
And a few things that you said
helped me make that decision.

668
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:17,111
So... thanks.

669
00:41:18,174 --> 00:41:20,144
Okay, well...

670
00:41:20,475 --> 00:41:22,906
Stay safe out there.
Take care.

671
00:41:24,417 --> 00:41:30,125
