1
00:00:18,158 --> 00:00:19,935
This is clark.
Please leave a message.

2
00:00:20,275 --> 00:00:22,274
And i'll get back to you
as soon as i can.

3
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:25,383
This is chloe with
message number one-too-many.

4
00:00:25,508 --> 00:00:28,790
I know trying to lead
a contingent of kryptonians

5
00:00:28,915 --> 00:00:31,957
looking for a new lease on life is putting
a lot of weight on your shoulders

6
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,592
and i don't want to add to that
but i'm still trying to set up

7
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:36,761
an official meeting
with our supergang.

8
00:00:36,886 --> 00:00:39,131
We're playing too fast and loose.

9
00:00:39,256 --> 00:00:41,915
We need to start taking this
more seriously.

10
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:14,573
Who are you?

11
00:01:14,698 --> 00:01:16,801
My name's sylvester pemberton.

12
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:19,369
You and i share something in common.

13
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,495
We're both trying to bring
a team together.

14
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:23,492
I don't know
what you're talking about.

15
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,709
You're the one they call watchtower.

16
00:01:26,403 --> 00:01:28,937
Watchtower?

17
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,784
Technology today makes hiding
a whole lot harder, miss sullivan.

18
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:38,293
When someone like you reaches out
and plugs into so many outlets

19
00:01:38,418 --> 00:01:40,852
someone else is bound to pull
out one of those cords

20
00:01:40,977 --> 00:01:43,461
and follow it back to the source.

21
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:45,530
You're lucky a friend did it first.

22
00:01:45,655 --> 00:01:47,256
Friends?

23
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,394
Friends don't sneak up
on each other in a dark alley.

24
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,162
Is it just me, or did it get
really cold really fast?

25
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,268
Stay down, miss sullivan.

26
00:03:07,806 --> 00:03:10,658
Help! Somebody, help!

27
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,952
They came after us.

28
00:03:14,077 --> 00:03:16,955
They'll come after all of you.

29
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,780
Wha...

30
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:20,425
check.

31
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:23,828
What? Check what?
Check what?!

32
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:27,232
Who are you?

33
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:29,201
Who's coming?!

34
00:03:34,498 --> 00:03:37,798
Smallville 911

35
00:03:41,431 --> 00:03:44,571
synchro: flolo

36
00:04:21,178 --> 00:04:23,512
for seriessub. Om

37
00:04:42,446 --> 00:04:44,348
- are you okay?
- Yeah.

38
00:04:44,473 --> 00:04:47,652
Just some moderate frostbite
and a little sleep deprivation.

39
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:51,056
Nothing a cup of hot cocoa
and a nap won't fix.

40
00:04:51,181 --> 00:04:53,558
<i>But the real question is,
are you okay?</i>

41
00:04:53,683 --> 00:04:57,061
- I haven't heard from you in days.
- Yeah, we've been playing phone tag.

42
00:04:57,186 --> 00:05:00,765
No, phone tag implies two people.
I've been playing phone solitaire.

43
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,668
- Not nearly as much fun.
- I'm sorry. I've been meaning to call.

44
00:05:03,793 --> 00:05:06,238
It's okay.
No apology is needed.

45
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:09,625
Protecting the streets
of metropolis and chasing down lois lane

46
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,416
is more than enough to juggle.

47
00:05:11,541 --> 00:05:14,579
Add to that you're now leading
the secret city of kandor.

48
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:16,881
I'm only helping them
find their place here.

49
00:05:17,006 --> 00:05:20,337
They're trying to make earth
their home, like john jones did

50
00:05:20,462 --> 00:05:23,065
when he got a job in the police
department and became a detective.

51
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,151
What? You're expecting
the kandorians

52
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:27,626
to just become firemen
and short-order cooks?

53
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:30,683
They need to make their own lives
and then move on from there.

54
00:05:39,262 --> 00:05:41,101
Who was he?

55
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:44,322
His name was sylvester pemberton,

56
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:47,169
but other than that,
i haven't got a clue.

57
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,147
But i'm gonna get one.

58
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,758
Hi, again. I just want to make sure
you have all my contact info

59
00:05:59,883 --> 00:06:02,694
- in case you need anything else.
- I think i'm all set, miss sullivan.

60
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,515
Thank you.

61
00:06:05,918 --> 00:06:07,018
No!

62
00:06:09,092 --> 00:06:11,302
What do you mean?!
He can't be dead!

63
00:06:11,427 --> 00:06:13,127
Don't.

64
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:22,129
Are you all right?

65
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:29,377
My friend was murdered.

66
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:31,390
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:37,789
I don't know what to do.

68
00:06:38,951 --> 00:06:40,965
I don't know
what i'm supposed to do.

69
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:43,063
Do you want to sit down?

70
00:06:48,764 --> 00:06:50,909
What is wrong with you people?

71
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:53,864
- Us people?
- The press.

72
00:06:53,989 --> 00:06:55,887
Haven't you vultures
done enough to sylvester?

73
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:57,600
I wasn't looking for a quote.

74
00:06:57,725 --> 00:06:59,808
Just stay the hell away from me.

75
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,889
What was that drama about?

76
00:07:05,014 --> 00:07:07,596
She obviously has a problem
with reporters.

77
00:07:07,721 --> 00:07:09,718
She's friends
with sylvester pemberton.

78
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:14,112
Pemberton knew about watchtower.
He wore some kind of weird uniform.

79
00:07:14,237 --> 00:07:16,897
He had a weapon
that could control light.

80
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:18,995
He was killed by ice

81
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,272
from someone or something.

82
00:07:21,876 --> 00:07:25,067
I'm getting some serious wall
of weird flashbacks here.

83
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:28,579
I know that you have a lot
of things pressing right now,

84
00:07:28,704 --> 00:07:31,050
but this is a job for clark kent.

85
00:07:32,075 --> 00:07:34,827
His final phone call
lasted 30 minutes.

86
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,246
It was with a guy named
wesley dodds.

87
00:07:38,324 --> 00:07:40,448
You need to go check it out.

88
00:09:03,263 --> 00:09:06,098
You dreamt about me,
didn't you, mr. Dodds?

89
00:09:06,427 --> 00:09:08,398
But that's what you do.

90
00:09:08,523 --> 00:09:11,106
You dream about killing.

91
00:09:14,577 --> 00:09:17,430
It's time for the sandman
to finally have

92
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:19,547
a good night's sleep.

93
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,250
- You got my message.
- I got all 10 of them.

94
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:33,893
- Where are the other superfriends?
- Still waiting for them to ping me back.

95
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:36,106
See, this is why i keep asking
everybody to come up

96
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:39,074
with some sort of standardized trouble
alert. The team needs structure.

97
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:42,466
Is that what we're lacking?
You're really on a kick lately.

98
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:44,994
Personal phone conversations...

99
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,952
bank records...
amazon wish list.

100
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:50,454
Big sister's watching.

101
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:52,758
<i>Is that my e-mail?</i>

102
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:55,348
I'll have you know
that those messages

103
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:57,719
between me and canary
were purely platonic.

104
00:09:58,988 --> 00:10:02,391
Can we skip your virtual love life
and actually focus on the job here?

105
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,495
- Gladly.
- Great.

106
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,686
Our victim's name
is sylvester pemberton,

107
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:10,770
and he had a long criminal record.

108
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:14,178
Fraud, embezzlement,
and assault. He didn't have any family

109
00:10:14,303 --> 00:10:16,804
but he did have a friend
show up at the hospital.

110
00:10:24,847 --> 00:10:27,792
Courtney whitmore. She's a sophomore
at blue valley high,

111
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:31,029
and, she gets a big old
d- plus for her attendance.

112
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:33,295
She hasn't been to school
in the last three weeks.

113
00:10:33,551 --> 00:10:36,009
You don't think blondie's
our killer, do you?

114
00:10:36,691 --> 00:10:39,870
No, but i do think
she knows something.

115
00:10:39,995 --> 00:10:42,269
I want to take a closer look

116
00:10:42,394 --> 00:10:45,920
at this glowing staff the police
have in evidence. We need to get it.

117
00:10:47,403 --> 00:10:49,976
"We" meaning "me," right?

118
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:00,048
Hello?

119
00:11:05,672 --> 00:11:07,501
Mr. Dodds?

120
00:12:00,268 --> 00:12:03,124
No bullets. Just residual ice again.

121
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:07,623
So, minus the patriotic
hoodie plus one gas mask,

122
00:12:07,748 --> 00:12:09,767
and dodds was killed the
same way as pemberton?

123
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:12,903
With what? Some kind of ice weapon?

124
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:16,212
Evidence would suggest that weapon
is more of a who than a what.

125
00:12:16,337 --> 00:12:18,637
The ice samples we pulled
from the first victim's wounds

126
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:20,368
have human dna.

127
00:12:20,808 --> 00:12:24,283
So the killer was some kind of
meta-human with an icy touch?

128
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:28,264
Well, that explains my arctic
ride in the dumpster of doom.

129
00:12:31,714 --> 00:12:33,990
Well, he certainly

130
00:12:34,115 --> 00:12:37,052
has interesting taste in victims.

131
00:12:38,086 --> 00:12:41,003
But clark said that the
assailant left the letters j-s-a.

132
00:12:41,128 --> 00:12:43,818
You have any idea what that means?

133
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:46,737
Maybe it's a calling card.

134
00:12:46,862 --> 00:12:49,020
Our cold-blooded cryo-killer

135
00:12:49,145 --> 00:12:51,368
definitely seems to
have a score to settle.

136
00:12:51,493 --> 00:12:53,362
What was clark able to dig up?

137
00:12:55,371 --> 00:12:58,382
Nothing yet. When he checked
in, he was still knee-deep

138
00:12:58,507 --> 00:13:00,451
<i>in excavation at the
daily planet archives.</i>

139
00:13:00,576 --> 00:13:02,854
Right. Let me run a
few more tests on this.

140
00:13:02,979 --> 00:13:05,038
And i'll see if i can help clark

141
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:08,026
unearth some answers
about the elusive jsa.

142
00:14:19,017 --> 00:14:21,165
Didn't think we'd
have to dig this deep.

143
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,167
I couldn't find anything online

144
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:26,068
beyond sylvester
pemberton's rap sheet.

145
00:14:28,484 --> 00:14:30,841
Maybe they didn't want
anyone else finding it.

146
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,343
They?

147
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:34,168
"They" who?

148
00:14:34,293 --> 00:14:37,857
Sylvester pemberton worked with 12 other
known criminals including wesley dodds.

149
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:41,075
He mentioned bringing
a team back together.

150
00:14:41,782 --> 00:14:44,632
Back together? That means, at
some point, they broke apart.

151
00:14:57,006 --> 00:14:59,739
They were systematically
caught and taken down.

152
00:15:02,064 --> 00:15:05,309
- For what?
- The crimes don't match who they are.

153
00:15:05,434 --> 00:15:08,536
Yeah, but they were called
"con men" for a reason.

154
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,958
That's sylvester pemberton.

155
00:15:21,557 --> 00:15:24,166
He was accused of embezzling
from his own company.

156
00:15:34,763 --> 00:15:37,608
That's wesley dodds
international business.

157
00:15:37,733 --> 00:15:40,229
He had no prior criminal record

158
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:44,081
until he was arrested at a student
demonstration that turned violent.

159
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:46,194
A young woman was killed.

160
00:15:53,616 --> 00:15:55,164
Who's that?

161
00:15:58,961 --> 00:16:01,899
Al pratt. Physics
professor at calvin college.

162
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:06,381
Arrested for assaulting police
officers when they went after dodds.

163
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,020
Wait a minute. I know
that guy. That's ted grant.

164
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,454
He's a heavyweight champion, but...

165
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,922
how is he involved with these guys?

166
00:16:27,049 --> 00:16:29,822
Jay garrick, a research scientist.

167
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:32,820
He's charged with fraud
and resisting arrest.

168
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,794
Alan scott, the c. E.o.
Of a broadcasting company?

169
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,396
Arrested for aiding and abetting.

170
00:16:42,521 --> 00:16:45,096
They have no connections
besides their arrests.

171
00:16:45,221 --> 00:16:47,504
They don't even
sound like criminals.

172
00:16:57,985 --> 00:17:00,246
I got to say that abigail hunkel

173
00:17:00,371 --> 00:17:02,499
doesn't exactly strike
fear in this hero's heart.

174
00:17:02,624 --> 00:17:04,161
Talking about these arrest reports,

175
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:06,597
each one of them tried to
take the fall for the other,

176
00:17:06,722 --> 00:17:09,919
- and they tried to protect one another.
- I guess during the golden age

177
00:17:10,044 --> 00:17:13,036
of robbery and racketeering,
there was honor among thieves.

178
00:17:13,161 --> 00:17:15,187
This goes beyond honor.

179
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:19,125
There were missing witnesses,
circumstantial evidence,

180
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,435
accusations of jury tampering.

181
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,653
They stood by one another, in the end,
none of the convictions held up.

182
00:17:29,778 --> 00:17:32,119
Almost sounds like you admire them.

183
00:17:33,548 --> 00:17:35,316
I admire their loyalty.

184
00:17:36,884 --> 00:17:39,138
I'll stay here and
finish downloading the 411

185
00:17:39,263 --> 00:17:41,045
on the mystery men
the old-fashioned way.

186
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:43,547
You need to go and warn carter hall.

187
00:17:43,672 --> 00:17:46,037
He's the next name on
pemberton's call list.

188
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:48,690
He called him over a dozen
times in the last two days.

189
00:18:01,877 --> 00:18:04,545
What kind of a team was this?

190
00:18:45,087 --> 00:18:47,523
The museum is closed...

191
00:18:51,093 --> 00:18:52,760
permanently.

192
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:57,092
- The door was open.
- Wasn't supposed to be.

193
00:18:57,634 --> 00:18:59,586
Mr. Hall?

194
00:19:01,603 --> 00:19:05,006
<i>Mr. Hall, i'm clark kent
from the daily planet.</i>

195
00:19:07,743 --> 00:19:09,252
What do you want?

196
00:19:09,377 --> 00:19:11,753
I came by to talk to you
about a few of your friends.

197
00:19:11,878 --> 00:19:14,182
Sylvester pemberton, wesley dodds.

198
00:19:14,555 --> 00:19:16,548
They were both murdered.

199
00:19:18,216 --> 00:19:21,031
Red, white, and blue. Two betrayed.

200
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:25,059
Stars and stripesy,
stars and stripe.

201
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:29,707
Sandman doesn't dream anymore.
Is mister terrific still terrific?

202
00:19:29,832 --> 00:19:32,363
- I don't think so.
- Who's that?

203
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,111
Who is that? Who is that?

204
00:19:34,236 --> 00:19:37,167
Kent nelson. Dr. Kent nelson.

205
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:40,618
But the doctor is
out. He's gone bowling.

206
00:19:40,743 --> 00:19:43,399
My friend is very sick.

207
00:19:44,012 --> 00:19:47,314
Now, i haven't spoken to
pemberton or dodds in years.

208
00:19:48,098 --> 00:19:50,167
Sylvester pemberton
called your phone

209
00:19:50,292 --> 00:19:53,502
- several times over the last few days.
- I didn't answer.

210
00:19:54,543 --> 00:19:58,196
I understand that you'd be reluctant
to talk to the police, given your past.

211
00:19:58,364 --> 00:20:00,323
You don't know anything
about my past, kid.

212
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:04,374
No, he doesn't. Ticktock.
The hourman's run out.

213
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:07,756
The atom is split. No, he doesn't.

214
00:20:08,492 --> 00:20:11,305
He doesn't, nabu,
so stop whispering.

215
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:22,249
We have nothing else to say.

216
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,807
Thank you for your time.

217
00:20:34,921 --> 00:20:37,041
The helmet has something to say.

218
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,043
He whispers. He whispers.
He could help.

219
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:46,846
We only help ourselves, nelson.

220
00:20:49,044 --> 00:20:51,521
Like we've always had to.

221
00:20:51,646 --> 00:20:53,376
Maybe...

222
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,746
maybe not.

223
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,814
Oh, yeah,
i got a peek inside lockup.

224
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:09,951
Pemberton's glow stick is m. I.a.

225
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:12,469
Oliver, we have to track it down.

226
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,440
Call you back.

227
00:21:20,452 --> 00:21:22,877
Excuse me. Miss whitmore?

228
00:21:24,570 --> 00:21:27,178
- Do i know you?
- If i had to take a guess,

229
00:21:27,303 --> 00:21:29,512
i'd say that golden rod
doesn't belong to you.

230
00:21:29,637 --> 00:21:31,323
It belongs to me now.

231
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:33,353
Don't want to get the
police involved in this?

232
00:21:33,478 --> 00:21:35,520
It'd be a shame to miss
your junior junior prom.

233
00:21:35,645 --> 00:21:37,513
Breaking and entering
into police lockup

234
00:21:37,638 --> 00:21:40,214
gets you more
than a slap on the wrist.

235
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,807
Come any closer and i'll give you
my version of a slap on the wrist.

236
00:21:43,932 --> 00:21:46,298
Let me just cut to
the chase, lite-brite.

237
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:49,146
Two people were murdered,
including a friend of yours.

238
00:21:49,271 --> 00:21:50,280
Two?

239
00:21:50,405 --> 00:21:52,434
I'm trying to figure out
who's behind all this,

240
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,532
but i need you to
be straight with me.

241
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:57,755
We help ourselves.

242
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,680
Hey, wait!

243
00:22:14,117 --> 00:22:17,396
If someone's killing criminals
from the past, why kidnap courtney?

244
00:22:17,521 --> 00:22:19,331
Maybe she knew
what sylvester pemberton

245
00:22:19,456 --> 00:22:22,757
had hidden up his star-covered sleeve.
His car received a handful

246
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:26,316
of parking tickets in this lot
so it should be easy to spot.

247
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,595
You could say that.

248
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,350
All right.

249
00:22:38,475 --> 00:22:41,420
Just give me a sec
to get this door open.

250
00:22:41,545 --> 00:22:43,913
Or you could just try the handle.

251
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:49,328
Clark's at the daily
planet trying to track

252
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,579
pemberton's home address right now

253
00:22:51,704 --> 00:22:54,355
but it looks like
he may have been living here.

254
00:22:54,848 --> 00:22:58,197
If he knew someone was after
him maybe he was on the run.

255
00:22:59,863 --> 00:23:03,199
His choice of transport
doesn't exactly blend in.

256
00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,149
"Star rocket racer."

257
00:23:11,274 --> 00:23:13,990
What do you suppose this was
their getaway car?

258
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:23,219
He knew about us.

259
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:27,487
He knew our identities.

260
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:31,193
That means
courtney probably does, too.

261
00:23:34,177 --> 00:23:37,342
You shouldn't have dragged
sylvester's sidekick into this, nelson.

262
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:39,244
I'm not his sidekick.

263
00:23:39,369 --> 00:23:41,680
I'm his protege.

264
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,315
You're a little girl.

265
00:23:44,534 --> 00:23:47,144
Your stepfather
must be worried sick.

266
00:23:48,211 --> 00:23:50,088
Go home.

267
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,491
I read sylvester's coroner report.

268
00:23:52,616 --> 00:23:55,694
There was frostbite
around the bullet wounds but no bullets.

269
00:23:55,819 --> 00:23:57,529
It's him, isn't it?

270
00:23:57,654 --> 00:23:59,588
Jack frost nippin' at our toes.

271
00:24:00,957 --> 00:24:03,335
Oliver queen said
that there are two dead.

272
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,368
Wesley dodds, the sandman.

273
00:24:06,763 --> 00:24:09,498
We have to do something.

274
00:24:15,605 --> 00:24:18,407
Look at kent nelson, courtney.

275
00:24:21,912 --> 00:24:24,586
He spends most of his days
wandering the streets,

276
00:24:25,136 --> 00:24:29,140
searching for the secrets to the
universe at the bottomof trash cans.

277
00:24:30,002 --> 00:24:32,197
So, doctor fate is incapacitated.

278
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:35,279
The sandman and
the star-spangled kid are both dead.

279
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:38,015
You were their leader.

280
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,464
What's your excuse?

281
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:48,547
Please don't make me ask
another team for help.

282
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:52,074
The kids out there
playing hero are hardly a team.

283
00:24:53,376 --> 00:24:55,354
They don't know how to lace up
their own boots.

284
00:24:55,578 --> 00:24:58,557
Maybe if you had laced up your boots
when sylvester had asked you to,

285
00:24:58,682 --> 00:25:01,498
- he might still be alive!
- Don't waste your breath.

286
00:25:01,623 --> 00:25:04,487
I have enough guilt to last
20 lifetimes.

287
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:10,794
What would shiera have done?

288
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:28,934
Oliver's searching all over
the city for any sign of courtney.

289
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:32,178
- How did they know our identities?
- They've been tracking us a long time.

290
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:35,096
Let's just hope the prime murder
suspect hasn't. Did you find one?

291
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:39,001
Temperature dropped 40 degrees
right before pemberton was attacked.

292
00:25:39,689 --> 00:25:42,200
You said that the skin
around pemberton's wounds

293
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:44,436
was covered with ice,
just like wesley dodds'.

294
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:47,392
This is what led me to joar mahkent.

295
00:25:49,174 --> 00:25:50,809
Back in pemberton's day,

296
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:53,578
he was a cryo-kinetic hit man
that was called the icicle

297
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:56,217
- where's the icicle now?
- He's still recovering

298
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:59,384
from some serious injuries he sustained
several years ago.

299
00:25:59,509 --> 00:26:02,665
He's in the psych ward
at metropolis general.

300
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,415
<i>At least he's supposed to be.</i>

301
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:24,376
We're gonna need him, nelson.

302
00:26:24,584 --> 00:26:25,684
No.

303
00:26:26,536 --> 00:26:27,636
No.

304
00:26:27,938 --> 00:26:29,014
No, no.

305
00:26:29,139 --> 00:26:32,050
No. I'm not good enough.

306
00:26:32,175 --> 00:26:34,718
My morality might have wavered

307
00:26:35,115 --> 00:26:37,010
yours never did.

308
00:26:57,671 --> 00:27:00,145
You don't realize...

309
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:03,155
how badly i wish
i could remember, carter.

310
00:27:05,442 --> 00:27:08,982
I wish i could remember what
my life was like before doctor fate.

311
00:27:11,915 --> 00:27:14,040
I think i had a wife.

312
00:27:15,284 --> 00:27:17,873
Her name was inza.

313
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,429
And i had a family.

314
00:27:21,162 --> 00:27:24,193
But i don't know
where they are anymore.

315
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:28,497
I scared them away.

316
00:27:31,501 --> 00:27:34,103
Not all of them, my friend.

317
00:27:51,021 --> 00:27:54,560
Please, nabu,
don't whisper too loudly.

318
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:58,427
Don't show me what can be or not be.

319
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,067
Fate is a fatal thing.

320
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:31,260
Greetings, hawkman.

321
00:28:31,798 --> 00:28:33,832
Doctor fate?

322
00:28:50,347 --> 00:28:53,615
It's been a long while
since i made someone bleed.

323
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,668
Time to go hunting.

324
00:29:19,871 --> 00:29:23,146
Can't help but wonder what happened
to these people. They were so close.

325
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:25,682
They were criminals, and they were
caught. That's what happened.

326
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,518
Carter hall's definitely
hiding something else in that museum.

327
00:29:28,643 --> 00:29:30,998
- Reporter's intuition?
- Clark kent's.

328
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,459
What is it, chloe?

329
00:29:36,584 --> 00:29:38,361
Dead end.

330
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:41,397
The icicle's been in a vegetative
state for the last decade.

331
00:29:41,522 --> 00:29:43,842
If that's true, there's no way
he can be our killer.

332
00:29:54,168 --> 00:29:55,904
What are you doing to him?

333
00:30:06,914 --> 00:30:10,003
Your fate is utterly binding.

334
00:30:10,604 --> 00:30:13,419
You are invaluable, clark kent.

335
00:30:14,136 --> 00:30:16,032
But you...

336
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:18,982
you walk the same path i do,
chloe sullivan.

337
00:30:24,098 --> 00:30:25,665
Who are you?

338
00:30:25,973 --> 00:30:28,268
Let me show you, my friend.

339
00:30:39,691 --> 00:30:41,296
- What's wrong?
- Clark's gone.

340
00:30:41,516 --> 00:30:44,360
- What do you mean, "he's gone"?
- Like one of pemberton's old gang

341
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:45,862
somehow teleported him away.

342
00:30:45,987 --> 00:30:48,261
He said he had to show him something.
Called him his friend.

343
00:30:48,489 --> 00:30:50,533
Where would they take him?

344
00:30:50,658 --> 00:30:52,502
I think the same place
they took courtney.

345
00:30:52,627 --> 00:30:54,655
Another twist to the mystery.

346
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,374
Satellites caught the glow of that staff
over the metropolis sky 10 minutes ago.

347
00:30:58,499 --> 00:31:02,127
I followed it. Wherever goldilocks went,
she got a change of clothes.

348
00:31:07,341 --> 00:31:10,758
- It's getting stranger.
- Stranger how?

349
00:31:10,883 --> 00:31:14,273
It's in the middle
of the night in suicide slum.

350
00:31:14,682 --> 00:31:16,726
She's standing under a streetlight.

351
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:18,895
She's all dolled up
with no place to go.

352
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,810
Looks like she's making
herself a target.

353
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,468
What the hell are you doing here?!

354
00:31:29,764 --> 00:31:31,064
Me?!

355
00:31:31,332 --> 00:31:33,056
What are you doing?!
Get out of here!

356
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:39,365
Red, white, and blue.
Loud and proud to be an american. Nice.

357
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,065
At least i'm proud of
something other than myself.

358
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:45,333
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I know what kind of hero you are.

359
00:31:45,813 --> 00:31:49,025
Is the masked cheerleader
really talking down to me?

360
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,034
Where's my friend?
Where's clark?

361
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:58,951
Anyone up for some ice cream?

362
00:32:02,096 --> 00:32:04,007
Who are you supposed to be, sweetie?

363
00:32:04,132 --> 00:32:05,942
The new star-spangled kid?

364
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:08,174
- It's stargirl.
- Say "cheese."

365
00:33:32,253 --> 00:33:35,031
You jaded jerk!
You've just ruined everything!

366
00:33:35,156 --> 00:33:36,866
This was my chance.

367
00:33:36,991 --> 00:33:40,231
I was supposed to get the first shot
at sylvester's killer!

368
00:33:41,295 --> 00:33:43,526
- He promised me.
- He?

369
00:33:43,651 --> 00:33:45,063
He who?

370
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:12,635
You okay?

371
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,637
He'll live.

372
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,512
Now, stay the hell
out of our business.

373
00:34:20,368 --> 00:34:23,226
The next time,
i won't ask so nicely.

374
00:34:45,098 --> 00:34:48,710
10 to 1 says pigeon man's got clark
locked up in a birdcage somewhere.

375
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:51,767
I don't know who the hell these people
are but they sure don't like us.

376
00:34:51,892 --> 00:34:54,282
- I thought you said it didn't hurt.
- I lied.

377
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:56,985
You're lucky he didn't drop
you from 10 stories up.

378
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,865
I don't feel lucky.
As much as i hate to admit it,

379
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:02,490
these people really know
what they're doing.

380
00:35:02,615 --> 00:35:06,287
Don't you think it's sad that a secret
society of retired supervillains

381
00:35:06,412 --> 00:35:09,508
can actually come out of the mothballs
and tear us apart like this?

382
00:35:09,633 --> 00:35:11,519
They know everything about us.

383
00:35:11,644 --> 00:35:13,368
Yeah, we don't know
anything about them.

384
00:35:13,493 --> 00:35:16,294
Maybe it's time i gave up
on bringing the band back together.

385
00:35:16,419 --> 00:35:18,996
Maybe this has all been
a lost cause.

386
00:35:19,365 --> 00:35:21,276
Don't give up on us yet.

387
00:35:21,401 --> 00:35:24,382
We may be a bit dysfunctional
and hard to wrangle at times,

388
00:35:24,507 --> 00:35:27,166
but when the chips are down,
we're always there.

389
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,284
They took clark
out from under our noses.

390
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:32,790
And i took this off the winged wonder
when he yanked me into the sky.

391
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:42,236
Looks like an antique...

392
00:35:42,789 --> 00:35:45,175
from a museum.

393
00:35:46,292 --> 00:35:48,736
I say we get some reinforcements,

394
00:35:48,861 --> 00:35:52,464
get clark, throw them
through some windows.

395
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:58,053
Detective john jones.

396
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:56,711
Why did you bring me here?

397
00:39:56,836 --> 00:40:00,521
Doctor fate says you're a big deal.
I don't see it.

398
00:40:01,112 --> 00:40:04,125
Clark kent is not like the others.

399
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:06,866
His path is righteous.

400
00:40:07,553 --> 00:40:09,862
If doctor fate says he's okay,

401
00:40:09,987 --> 00:40:12,391
that means he's okay, right?

402
00:40:13,701 --> 00:40:16,170
Why have you been watching us?

403
00:40:16,971 --> 00:40:20,241
Sylvester wanted to bring together
a new justice society...

404
00:40:20,366 --> 00:40:23,111
one with the surviving members
and us new kids.

405
00:40:23,811 --> 00:40:27,515
It wouldn't have worked, courtney.
People never learn.

406
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,618
This generation will make the
same mistakes the last one did...

407
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:32,955
like the one before that.

408
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:36,390
Obvious by how you've skipped
your homework,

409
00:40:36,726 --> 00:40:38,726
you don't even know who we are.

410
00:40:39,596 --> 00:40:42,230
You don't know who we are either.

411
00:40:42,355 --> 00:40:45,156
But none of us here
are the bad guys.

412
00:40:47,002 --> 00:40:49,344
You sure about that?

413
00:40:49,902 --> 00:40:52,440
The winged warrior here
threw me through a window.

414
00:40:52,565 --> 00:40:55,630
I hope i didn't make you cry.

415
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:59,663
- Drop the mace, conan.
- I will on your head.

416
00:41:00,493 --> 00:41:04,218
Bring it, big bird.
Just for the record, you started it.

417
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:06,220
I'll finish it.

418
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:11,833
Hawkman, no!

419
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:19,691
I hope it's not too late to say,
"we come in peace."

420
00:41:26,415 --> 00:41:29,108
This is our responsibility.

421
00:41:29,233 --> 00:41:32,445
The people being murdered
were our teammates, our friends.

422
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,414
Once we find the icicle,
we'll fade back away.

423
00:41:35,539 --> 00:41:37,783
We're not asking you to.

424
00:41:37,908 --> 00:41:40,553
All we want is justice.

425
00:41:40,678 --> 00:41:44,547
Justice? Everything we've heard
about you guys is a little blurry

426
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:47,426
<i>- when it comes to justice.
- You mean what you've read.</i>

427
00:41:47,551 --> 00:41:49,462
Do you even know
who you're working with here?

428
00:41:49,587 --> 00:41:52,175
These old men have criminal records
longer than that staff of yours.

429
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:55,601
- They made those up!
- It's none of their business.

430
00:41:55,726 --> 00:41:58,723
With all due respect,
we're making it our business.

431
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:02,541
Even when i had the power to
leave earth, i chose not to,

432
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:05,545
for one reason, hope.

433
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:07,747
Hope for the future.

434
00:42:07,872 --> 00:42:11,117
Humanity's capacity
for violence is great,

435
00:42:11,242 --> 00:42:13,386
but their capacity for hope

436
00:42:13,511 --> 00:42:16,079
is greater than any
i've ever encountered.

437
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,009
There's a murderer on the loose.

438
00:42:20,134 --> 00:42:23,289
As long as you know something
about it, we're not going anywhere.

439
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,273
I'm sorry i was late for breakfast,

440
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:34,613
but you would not believe
the morning i just had.

441
00:42:34,738 --> 00:42:38,277
On my way to interviewing nobel
prize-winning tech guru michael holt,

442
00:42:38,402 --> 00:42:40,046
my taxi ran out of gas.

443
00:42:40,171 --> 00:42:43,549
So i got out, like
a good soldier, and i pushed.

444
00:42:43,674 --> 00:42:45,384
Then a bus ran through a mud puddle.

445
00:42:45,509 --> 00:42:48,821
Not that i don't mind a good mud
bath but i prefer mine without clothes.

446
00:42:48,946 --> 00:42:51,529
So by the time i got to met u.,
i was interviewing the cleanup crew

447
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:54,365
about how to get the stains
out of this jacket.

448
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:00,323
Thanks, lane.

449
00:43:04,295 --> 00:43:07,206
What could possibly be more important
than a morning date

450
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:09,132
with the great lois lane

451
00:43:13,604 --> 00:43:15,271
what is this?

452
00:43:46,370 --> 00:43:48,679
Mud wrestling again, lois?

453
00:43:55,055 --> 00:43:57,623
What brings the big boss all the way
downtown

454
00:43:57,748 --> 00:44:00,426
to the little newspaper that could?
I thought the daily planet

455
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:02,795
was slipping off your priority list.

456
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,600
- Print is dead.
- So is privacy.

457
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,649
I'm expecting a package myself.

458
00:44:12,818 --> 00:44:16,180
And you know the mailroom here.
They can get things a bit mixed up.

459
00:44:16,776 --> 00:44:19,263
My name in print.

460
00:44:21,572 --> 00:44:24,340
I guess i haven't been having
many problems.

461
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:27,310
No.

462
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:31,214
Not yet.

463
00:44:47,298 --> 00:44:49,208
What they did to you

464
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:52,177
was an injustice, dad.

465
00:44:53,174 --> 00:44:56,639
They took the only family
i have left away.

466
00:44:57,999 --> 00:45:01,513
I've only just begun to take
away them.

467
00:45:10,888 --> 00:45:12,865
The justice society of america

468
00:45:12,990 --> 00:45:15,922
was cleaning up the streets
before you were in diapers.

469
00:45:16,287 --> 00:45:18,938
We tried our best to stay out
of the public eye but

470
00:45:19,063 --> 00:45:22,434
a government task force got wind of
our

471
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,444
extracurricular activities.

472
00:45:25,569 --> 00:45:28,016
They wanted us to work for them.

473
00:45:28,141 --> 00:45:30,226
They wanted us to unmask.

474
00:45:30,574 --> 00:45:32,952
And you said no.

475
00:45:33,077 --> 00:45:34,981
We refused to play ball,

476
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:37,662
so they went after us hard.

477
00:45:37,787 --> 00:45:40,683
One by one,
they uncovered our identities.

478
00:45:41,865 --> 00:45:44,700
They had us arrested...

479
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,561
and institutionalized.

480
00:45:48,058 --> 00:45:51,027
They forced us out of the skies
and off the streets.

481
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:56,658
We were ripped away
from our families.

482
00:45:57,011 --> 00:45:59,578
While trying to protect them.

483
00:45:59,703 --> 00:46:02,133
Then why didn't you fight back?

484
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:04,158
We did.

485
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:07,543
For as long as we could.

486
00:46:09,613 --> 00:46:11,481
<i>As i could.</i>

487
00:46:13,988 --> 00:46:16,926
I wasn't the leader
they thought i was.

488
00:46:17,358 --> 00:46:19,744
I made too many mistakes.

489
00:46:24,094 --> 00:46:25,865
I've made mistakes,
but i haven't quit.

490
00:46:26,196 --> 00:46:29,853
<i>Haven't quit?
You haven't started.</i>

491
00:46:30,346 --> 00:46:32,163
Not as a team, anyway.

492
00:46:32,469 --> 00:46:34,457
You're making this too personal.

493
00:46:35,089 --> 00:46:38,776
That is our strength,
not our weakness.

494
00:46:39,209 --> 00:46:41,253
Carter, please.

495
00:46:41,378 --> 00:46:44,841
There's over a dozen members
of the justice society still out there.

496
00:46:45,182 --> 00:46:47,092
Jay, ted, alan.

497
00:46:47,217 --> 00:46:49,395
If we don't team up
and stop the icicle,

498
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,797
he'll go after them next.

499
00:46:51,922 --> 00:46:55,061
It's obvious
you still care about this team.

500
00:46:55,392 --> 00:46:57,503
If you didn't,

501
00:46:57,628 --> 00:47:00,096
you wouldn't have kept watch
over all of this.

502
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:06,710
This is a temporary alliance.

503
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:09,826
Do you have any idea
where we can find icicle?

504
00:47:10,615 --> 00:47:12,752
I've got one or two.

505
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:17,167
Unless this is costumes only.

506
00:47:17,481 --> 00:47:21,081
- Who's this... your secretary?
- Our eyes and ears.

507
00:47:21,385 --> 00:47:24,466
There's a couple possibilities
where icicle might show next.

508
00:47:24,788 --> 00:47:28,211
Security cameras caught him at the hospital
visiting his father last night target one.

509
00:47:28,336 --> 00:47:31,837
And if he's anything like his father he
is gonna need to replenish his abilities

510
00:47:31,962 --> 00:47:34,964
with some liquid nitrogen.
Target two.

511
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,105
Do you know where
the nearest nitrogen depot is?

512
00:47:39,274 --> 00:47:42,497
No, but i can find it.
I just need to look at their computer.

513
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,470
Got one?

514
00:48:46,204 --> 00:48:48,999
So, this is where you guys operate?

515
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:51,468
More or less.

516
00:48:51,742 --> 00:48:53,631
Mostly less.

517
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,983
I guess it's everything you could ever
ask for to fight the good fight, right?

518
00:49:05,184 --> 00:49:07,512
It's missing something.

519
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,801
Where are the pictures...

520
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:14,418
or, you know, a place
to sit down and eat?

521
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:20,407
Sylvester always told me
that the jsa's brownstone

522
00:49:20,532 --> 00:49:23,324
was considered a second home
for everyone.

523
00:49:23,449 --> 00:49:25,607
They'd even spend
thanksgivings there

524
00:49:25,732 --> 00:49:27,942
with their spouses and kids.

525
00:49:28,067 --> 00:49:30,633
- It was like a family.
- Yeah.

526
00:49:30,987 --> 00:49:33,205
<i>I mean, it was a family.</i>

527
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,211
How did you get involved
with the justice society?

528
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,394
My, stepfather, pat,

529
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:47,228
was sylvester pemberton's
sidekick years ago.

530
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:50,604
The star-spangled kid and stripesy.

531
00:49:50,729 --> 00:49:52,391
Stripesy?

532
00:49:52,516 --> 00:49:55,201
It was like
the worst code name ever.

533
00:49:55,683 --> 00:49:59,176
I found sylvester's
old equipment, and...

534
00:49:59,484 --> 00:50:02,734
at first, i put it on,
just to annoy pat.

535
00:50:04,771 --> 00:50:06,471
But...

536
00:50:07,331 --> 00:50:09,057
i don't know.

537
00:50:09,182 --> 00:50:11,841
The first time
i ever saved someone...

538
00:50:12,010 --> 00:50:14,052
you were hooked.

539
00:50:14,662 --> 00:50:16,162
Yeah.

540
00:50:16,506 --> 00:50:19,263
- Line and sinker.
- Yeah.

541
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,478
So, you're not actually related
to any of them?

542
00:50:24,286 --> 00:50:27,568
Family is not just about blood.

543
00:50:27,693 --> 00:50:29,393
And...

544
00:50:29,518 --> 00:50:32,991
watching people doesn't make
them a part of your life.

545
00:50:36,506 --> 00:50:38,654
I don't know.

546
00:50:38,779 --> 00:50:41,176
Maybe yur team would operate better

547
00:50:41,301 --> 00:50:43,478
if you didn't get together only
when there was trouble.

548
00:50:43,603 --> 00:50:47,555
And if you made it a little more
"home, sweet home"

549
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:50,675
and a little less nuclear war room.

550
00:50:54,304 --> 00:50:57,389
<i>Incoming communication green arrow.</i>

551
00:51:04,864 --> 00:51:07,463
Hey, oliver, what do you got?

552
00:51:07,588 --> 00:51:10,525
<i>I heard my wingman. Did you put
the call into the snow miser?</i>

553
00:51:10,891 --> 00:51:13,407
I rerouted the call through the hospital
and left a message that said

554
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:15,378
that his father's taken a turn
for the worst.

555
00:51:15,503 --> 00:51:18,519
If icicle is checking in as often
as he has been, we should be able

556
00:51:18,644 --> 00:51:20,952
<i>- to catch him at met gen.
- Thanks.</i>

557
00:51:24,127 --> 00:51:25,869
God, i hate waiting.

558
00:51:25,994 --> 00:51:29,012
But you love talking. Shut up.

559
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:36,205
Why did they have to team us
up together?

560
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:38,573
I asked them to...

561
00:51:38,698 --> 00:51:40,888
so i could keep you in line.

562
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,890
What are you my chaperone?

563
00:51:43,059 --> 00:51:46,436
Think of me as your parole
officer but with a mace.

564
00:51:48,599 --> 00:51:50,962
I don't know what that means.
But this whole thing is bad news.

565
00:51:51,087 --> 00:51:54,315
You want to know why? 'cause no
one's been able to answer "why."

566
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,883
Why what, green punching bag?

567
00:51:58,008 --> 00:52:00,087
Frosty's kid's going after you

568
00:52:00,212 --> 00:52:03,170
for putting dear old
in traction, right? But why now?

569
00:52:03,295 --> 00:52:05,663
It's been decades.

570
00:52:05,832 --> 00:52:09,015
Because revenge is a dish
best served cold.

571
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,863
We're telling jokes now?

572
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:16,659
Right.

573
00:52:24,164 --> 00:52:27,414
Why did you ask me to stay behind?
What is it we need to talk about?

574
00:52:27,539 --> 00:52:31,543
The hope for tomorrow that
your alien friend spoke of.

575
00:52:31,668 --> 00:52:34,043
You are that hope.

576
00:52:34,168 --> 00:52:36,230
I have seen it.

577
00:52:36,355 --> 00:52:38,922
Because you see the future?

578
00:52:39,458 --> 00:52:42,045
I see everyone's fate...

579
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:44,408
but my own.

580
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:47,113
Sometimes that scares me.

581
00:52:47,238 --> 00:52:51,099
But when i see the future
of someone such as yourself,

582
00:52:52,530 --> 00:52:55,550
i believe in tomorrow again.

583
00:52:55,675 --> 00:52:58,719
When you saw my fate,
what did you see?

584
00:52:58,844 --> 00:53:01,816
You will lead this generation

585
00:53:01,941 --> 00:53:04,992
as hawkman once led ours.

586
00:53:05,117 --> 00:53:08,742
You sound like a group
i met from the future.

587
00:53:09,246 --> 00:53:12,063
They hinted at my destiny
but they were as vague as you are.

588
00:53:12,232 --> 00:53:14,667
Then let me be specific.

589
00:53:14,792 --> 00:53:17,473
Although lex luthor
is your ultimate opponent,

590
00:53:17,598 --> 00:53:19,836
you will triumph over him.

591
00:53:22,068 --> 00:53:24,246
Lex is dead.

592
00:53:26,485 --> 00:53:29,793
And when you show yourself
to the world,

593
00:53:30,318 --> 00:53:33,585
it will be a different age
than ours.

594
00:53:34,176 --> 00:53:37,278
A silver age of heroism

595
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,860
that will start when
they look up into the sky at you

596
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:43,696
with hope for tomorrow.

597
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,858
You will help everyone embrace it.

598
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:51,048
Hello?
Hello?

599
00:53:51,962 --> 00:53:55,135
What's she doing here?
She shouldn't be in the middle of this.

600
00:53:56,335 --> 00:53:57,969
She is the key.

601
00:54:08,841 --> 00:54:10,329
Hello?

602
00:54:19,488 --> 00:54:21,357
Hello?!

603
00:54:32,577 --> 00:54:35,719
Careful, lois. This is the part
where the doomed girl

604
00:54:35,844 --> 00:54:38,671
runs into the guy
with the hockey mask.

605
00:54:38,796 --> 00:54:40,829
Greetings.

606
00:54:41,847 --> 00:54:43,613
What the...

607
00:54:48,174 --> 00:54:50,889
what is this...
reverse halloween?

608
00:54:51,775 --> 00:54:54,332
- Nice helmet.
- Thank you.

609
00:54:55,242 --> 00:54:57,441
I was looking for carter hall.

610
00:54:57,566 --> 00:54:59,434
He's not here.

611
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:02,430
Apparently, he was part of
a group of masked mystery men

612
00:55:02,555 --> 00:55:05,203
that were railroaded
out of business.

613
00:55:06,972 --> 00:55:08,721
I'm guessing you were one of them.

614
00:55:09,038 --> 00:55:12,043
I see your fate, lois lane.

615
00:55:12,488 --> 00:55:14,420
You are the one he will need.

616
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:16,896
He is the one you will need.

617
00:55:17,257 --> 00:55:20,008
- What?
- The savior...

618
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:22,494
the one who will lead us all...

619
00:55:22,619 --> 00:55:24,742
the sentient power.

620
00:55:33,616 --> 00:55:36,102
I wonder if he does horoscopes.

621
00:55:49,002 --> 00:55:52,249
You're taking this assignment
too personally.

622
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:56,543
<i>That's because it is personal,
waller.</i>

623
00:55:56,668 --> 00:55:59,023
<i>Agent waller.</i>

624
00:56:01,675 --> 00:56:03,985
Hawkman and the justice society

625
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:07,099
left my father brain-dead.

626
00:56:07,224 --> 00:56:10,784
And your mother died
in childbirth from hypothermia.

627
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:14,913
She froze from the inside out 'cause you
inherited your father's frosty touch.

628
00:56:15,229 --> 00:56:17,623
Who do you blame for her death?

629
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,152
Don't try and twist me around,
waller.

630
00:56:23,605 --> 00:56:26,009
Maybe you pulled me out of juvie,

631
00:56:26,134 --> 00:56:28,929
but the only reason i agreed to go
on these little missions of yours

632
00:56:29,054 --> 00:56:31,856
was to get a shot
at the justice society.

633
00:56:31,981 --> 00:56:34,370
I grew up in chicago, icicle.

634
00:56:34,495 --> 00:56:36,959
The cold doesn't bother me.

635
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:45,316
I killed everyone you asked me to...

636
00:56:45,879 --> 00:56:48,325
people i didn't know.

637
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:52,006
Maybe they had families.
Maybe they didn't deserve to die.

618
00:56:52,483 --> 00:56:56,954
i did it anyway.
I did you a favor.

639
00:56:57,694 --> 00:57:00,672
Let's be crystal-clear, icicle.

640
00:57:00,797 --> 00:57:03,252
No one's doing anyone a favor.
This is business.

641
00:57:03,421 --> 00:57:05,857
They took my father!

642
00:57:09,086 --> 00:57:10,894
If it wasn't for them,

643
00:57:11,019 --> 00:57:13,865
i wouldn't have all this blood
on my hands.

644
00:57:14,912 --> 00:57:17,295
<i>This is personal.</i>

645
00:57:17,420 --> 00:57:21,206
You don't like it, find someone els
to clean up your mess.

646
00:57:22,641 --> 00:57:24,280
You're right.

647
00:57:24,405 --> 00:57:27,288
This job should have been
finished years ago.

648
00:57:27,413 --> 00:57:30,224
It's a black mark
on checkmate's board.

649
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:33,084
Then let me finish it.

650
00:57:53,877 --> 00:57:56,096
How's everyone else doing?

651
00:57:56,221 --> 00:57:58,192
John and fate are
scouring the nitrogen depots.

652
00:57:58,317 --> 00:58:00,554
Hawkman and green arrow,
a.k.a. The new b.f.f.s,

653
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:03,370
are looking for ice boy.
Any luck on your end?

654
00:58:03,495 --> 00:58:06,827
I checked lois's car and apartment.
Someone led her to the museum.

655
00:58:06,952 --> 00:58:09,597
Someone who wants her to get caught
in the middle of all this.

656
00:58:09,722 --> 00:58:11,910
It's just a question of who.

657
00:58:23,395 --> 00:58:26,124
Should i even bother asking?

658
00:58:27,721 --> 00:58:31,180
You can either hand those to me
or i can take them from you.

659
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:34,547
It sounds like fun but given
our last few encounters,

660
00:58:34,672 --> 00:58:37,513
i should probably stay out
of the sandbox.

661
00:58:41,574 --> 00:58:43,308
Suspicious much?

662
00:58:45,115 --> 00:58:47,822
Maybe you two really
are perfect for each other

663
00:58:47,947 --> 00:58:49,958
you were smarter
when you were leaving.

664
00:58:50,083 --> 00:58:52,247
I always thought
it would be hard for you.

665
00:58:52,372 --> 00:58:55,022
Being boyfriend-girlfriend
with someone so nosy.

666
00:58:56,489 --> 00:58:59,200
Maybe you're not the only one
with a secret.

667
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,670
- What do you know about this?
- Not much.

668
00:59:03,256 --> 00:59:06,799
Just that your girlfriend
is in way over her head.

669
00:59:24,373 --> 00:59:27,229
And to think i was
actually looking forward

670
00:59:27,354 --> 00:59:31,108
to breakfast with the daily planet's
mild-mannered no-show.

671
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,440
Late night?

672
00:59:34,565 --> 00:59:37,573
I heard you were working on
some kind of murder case.

673
00:59:37,742 --> 00:59:40,178
<i>Cases. Plural.</i>

674
00:59:40,303 --> 00:59:43,781
And i've got my hands on a case
full of classified intel.

675
00:59:43,906 --> 00:59:46,571
Like double super-classified.

676
00:59:47,345 --> 00:59:50,429
- Mind if i take a look?
- Usually, we're a great team,

677
00:59:50,554 --> 00:59:53,890
but you already decided to go it
solo today so i just followed suit.

678
00:59:54,015 --> 00:59:56,457
I'm sorry that i was out, lois,
but maybe i can assist you.

679
00:59:56,582 --> 00:59:58,572
We could be like
woodward and bernstein.

680
00:59:58,697 --> 01:00:00,328
Lois and clark.

681
01:00:00,453 --> 01:00:04,067
If it's so double super-classified.
How did you get on the case, lois?

682
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:09,173
I was handpicked
by an aonymous source.

683
01:00:09,298 --> 01:00:12,825
The two people that were murdered
had criminal records

684
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:15,125
but it's all fabricated.

685
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:19,173
They were vigilantes like the blur.
Part of an underground group

686
01:00:19,298 --> 01:00:22,684
of honest-to-goodness
spandex-sporting superheroes.

687
01:00:22,809 --> 01:00:25,829
I met one of them. He was wearing
a gold-plated helmet and a cape,

688
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:28,613
whih actually looked pretty good.

689
01:00:29,298 --> 01:00:31,526
And that's all you know?

690
01:00:31,651 --> 01:00:32,751
No.

691
01:00:33,659 --> 01:00:37,398
Their leader...
a man named carter hall.

692
01:00:37,523 --> 01:00:40,710
Almost killed one of their enemies.
Someone named the icicle.

693
01:00:41,054 --> 01:00:44,138
He had a son,
and here's the weird thing.

694
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:49,505
And he was plucked from juvie
by someone very high up.

695
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:52,108
Sealed records.

696
01:00:54,099 --> 01:00:56,273
Now, i'm not supposed to
know this...

697
01:00:56,398 --> 01:00:58,513
but there were other bad guys

698
01:00:58,638 --> 01:01:01,469
that these underground heroes
fought and every single one of them

699
01:01:01,594 --> 01:01:03,647
was released from prison secretly.

700
01:01:03,772 --> 01:01:06,933
They and their records, m.i.a.

701
01:01:10,307 --> 01:01:12,657
Someone's collecting them.

702
01:01:16,787 --> 01:01:20,127
- I appreciate the assist.
- I'm interested in you.

703
01:01:20,252 --> 01:01:24,256
You are not a human,
but you are forced to be.

704
01:01:24,588 --> 01:01:27,185
I used to have special abilities
like clark.

705
01:01:27,310 --> 01:01:30,165
But you sacrificed them
to save clark kent.

706
01:01:31,537 --> 01:01:34,622
You see what i see in clark kent

707
01:01:34,747 --> 01:01:37,091
but without the aid
of the helmet of nabu.

708
01:01:37,216 --> 01:01:39,327
It's magic.

709
01:01:39,452 --> 01:01:42,600
Reveals the fates
of people around me.

710
01:01:43,489 --> 01:01:46,238
I look into the window of the future

711
01:01:46,363 --> 01:01:49,728
and witness what might be.

712
01:01:52,398 --> 01:01:56,210
But, eventually, it became too much.

713
01:01:56,335 --> 01:01:58,919
I saw too much.

714
01:02:00,740 --> 01:02:03,657
Before your people were destroyed,

715
01:02:03,782 --> 01:02:05,876
did you have a wife, john?

716
01:02:07,326 --> 01:02:09,391
And a daughter.

717
01:02:10,274 --> 01:02:12,860
You miss your family...

718
01:02:13,994 --> 01:02:15,905
as do i.

719
01:02:48,179 --> 01:02:50,307
We're too late.

720
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,227
He's already been here.

721
01:02:53,396 --> 01:02:56,561
It is not your fate to die
this day, martian.

722
01:03:09,137 --> 01:03:11,586
You've been out of the game
too long, doc.

723
01:03:11,711 --> 01:03:13,927
You're way out of practice.

724
01:03:14,546 --> 01:03:16,971
Your heyday...

725
01:03:17,586 --> 01:03:19,686
is over.

726
01:03:19,869 --> 01:03:22,349
But i'm still in my prime.

727
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:50,791
Courtney, i'm sorry
about doctor fate.

728
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:53,644
I know. When hawkman heard,
he flew off. Green arrow went after him.

729
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:56,356
- And john?
- This doctor named emil had him

730
01:03:56,481 --> 01:03:58,206
transfebred to a secured room.

731
01:03:58,331 --> 01:04:01,126
Dr. Emil, what do you think?

732
01:04:01,756 --> 01:04:04,728
John seems to be undergoing
some kind of incubation,

733
01:04:04,853 --> 01:04:08,133
but the end result,
we can't begin to guess.

734
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:13,657
Excuse me.

735
01:04:25,008 --> 01:04:28,521
Part of me wishes hawkman
would find icicle first.

736
01:04:29,434 --> 01:04:31,858
He'd do what i wouldn't.

737
01:04:34,752 --> 01:04:37,080
I know it's wrong.

738
01:04:38,466 --> 01:04:40,865
<i>It is wrong, courtney.</i>

739
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,670
Sylvester said that.

740
01:04:47,393 --> 01:04:50,947
The jsa has always done
the right thing.

741
01:04:51,777 --> 01:04:55,781
And in the end when everything
got turned upside down,

742
01:04:56,472 --> 01:04:59,493
hawkman began crossing the line
so many times

743
01:04:59,618 --> 01:05:01,495
that the line disappeared
altogether.

744
01:05:02,549 --> 01:05:04,878
Then it's up to you
to make it right.

745
01:05:05,003 --> 01:05:07,292
You're the next generation.

746
01:05:08,395 --> 01:05:11,096
Sylvester said that, too.

747
01:05:12,591 --> 01:05:14,999
You're a lot like him.

748
01:05:17,093 --> 01:05:19,395
When this is over,

749
01:05:19,520 --> 01:05:21,902
don't let the torch
that he kept burning.

750
01:05:22,027 --> 01:05:25,012
The one that he literally passed
on to you. Go out.

751
01:05:26,255 --> 01:05:29,338
Keep his legacy alive,
and you keep him alive.

752
01:05:45,064 --> 01:05:47,365
Those are classified.

753
01:05:50,456 --> 01:05:53,280
I was wondering how they got here.

754
01:05:53,405 --> 01:05:56,384
They were left for you, miss lane.

755
01:05:56,509 --> 01:05:58,719
Who are you?

756
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:03,704
If i'm going to give you
a front-page story, does it matter?

757
01:06:04,337 --> 01:06:06,384
Okay, then.

758
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:11,508
- Why me?
- I've read your work.

759
01:06:11,975 --> 01:06:14,969
You pull more skeletons
out of closets

760
01:06:15,094 --> 01:06:17,836
than the organization i work for
have hidden.

761
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,466
You embrace the truth.

762
01:06:23,036 --> 01:06:25,856
And the truth will set you free.

763
01:06:26,868 --> 01:06:29,073
Your point is?

764
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,023
I'll be in touch.

765
01:07:01,894 --> 01:07:04,277
This is it, dad.

766
01:07:09,074 --> 01:07:12,403
This is gonna help me
finish them off.

767
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:23,372
Now i'm ready.

768
01:07:28,586 --> 01:07:30,935
Goodbye, father.

769
01:07:41,344 --> 01:07:43,248
I love you.

770
01:08:10,650 --> 01:08:12,777
I'm thinking we should regroup
with the others

771
01:08:12,902 --> 01:08:16,547
- before we go after icicle jr.
- You go back to sherwood, robin hood.

772
01:08:16,672 --> 01:08:19,674
I'll turn the icicle
into slush myself.

773
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:27,567
It's not what happened to you
that destroyed this team, is it?

774
01:08:27,949 --> 01:08:29,961
It's what happened to her.

775
01:08:30,086 --> 01:08:32,496
Right? Hawkgirl?

776
01:08:32,621 --> 01:08:34,932
Who was she...
your partner?

777
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:38,212
My wife.

778
01:08:38,337 --> 01:08:40,822
You were married?

779
01:08:42,142 --> 01:08:44,400
Hard to believe?

780
01:08:44,525 --> 01:08:47,445
What would someone like me
know about love?

781
01:08:47,570 --> 01:08:50,181
I only know it ends.

782
01:08:50,306 --> 01:08:53,317
But it always ends,

783
01:08:53,442 --> 01:08:56,883
in every one of my lives,
past and present.

784
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:01,152
Past lives?

785
01:09:04,854 --> 01:09:08,289
Shiera and i were born
over 1,000 years ago.

786
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:12,603
We were cursed
by one of our enemies.

787
01:09:12,728 --> 01:09:16,732
Destined to fall in love,
only to watch each other die,

788
01:09:17,099 --> 01:09:20,034
lifetime after lifetime.

789
01:09:23,874 --> 01:09:26,874
The sooner this life is over,

790
01:09:27,946 --> 01:09:30,699
the soner i see my wife again.

791
01:09:35,117 --> 01:09:37,309
I've never had a connection
like that.

792
01:09:37,434 --> 01:09:41,327
- At least, not one that lasted.
- Because you hide it.

793
01:09:43,376 --> 01:09:45,472
Hide what?

794
01:09:46,973 --> 01:09:49,774
You don't want anyone to know
how important they are to you,

795
01:09:49,899 --> 01:09:52,343
so you act like a jackass.

796
01:10:00,748 --> 01:10:03,397
I do know what it's like to feel
like the only thing

797
01:10:03,522 --> 01:10:06,152
left to do with your life is throw
it away. But you didn't, did you?

798
01:10:06,277 --> 01:10:08,089
You stuck around for doctor fate.

799
01:10:13,689 --> 01:10:16,246
He needed my help.

800
01:10:16,371 --> 01:10:19,403
He did. He needed your help,
and now there's a young girl out there,

801
01:10:19,528 --> 01:10:21,975
and she's counting on you.
The rest of your team is out there.

802
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:25,441
So why don't you take
the death wish and shelf it?

803
01:10:37,913 --> 01:10:40,160
Thing's heavier than it looks.

804
01:10:44,954 --> 01:10:47,055
You get used to it.

805
01:10:59,201 --> 01:11:01,345
You really got to work
on your landings.

806
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:03,729
It would have been a lot
smoother if you hadn't thrown up.

807
01:11:03,854 --> 01:11:06,600
- Send me your dry-cleaning bill.
- Send me your dinner bill.

808
01:11:14,595 --> 01:11:16,155
How's john?

809
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:18,496
There's not much more
they can do for him.

810
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:20,829
Then i guess
we'll just have to wait.

811
01:11:20,954 --> 01:11:22,813
No more waiting.

812
01:11:23,072 --> 01:11:25,020
No more pairing off.

813
01:11:25,145 --> 01:11:27,428
We should have stuck together
from the beginning.

814
01:11:34,904 --> 01:11:37,396
Your fate is in my hands.

815
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:41,087
Or i guess i should say,
it's on my head.

816
01:12:43,473 --> 01:12:45,999
I killed you.

817
01:12:46,124 --> 01:12:48,986
I'm mars' sole survivor.

818
01:12:49,111 --> 01:12:51,282
There's a reason for that.

819
01:13:42,117 --> 01:13:44,624
I'm sorry about your friend.

820
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:49,569
So am i.

821
01:14:01,984 --> 01:14:04,902
You're not like the others, are you?

822
01:14:05,027 --> 01:14:07,197
Kids who are in it for the thrills

823
01:14:07,322 --> 01:14:10,070
or because they have a chip
on their shoulder?

824
01:14:10,378 --> 01:14:13,628
You don't do this
for glory or vengeance.

825
01:14:16,131 --> 01:14:17,832
I guess not.

826
01:14:21,374 --> 01:14:23,917
Your team is better
than i thought, too.

827
01:14:24,867 --> 01:14:27,374
Even i have to admit,

828
01:14:27,499 --> 01:14:30,044
green arrow has pretty good aim.

829
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:36,721
We're not a team. Not like yours.

830
01:14:37,119 --> 01:14:38,419
Why?

831
01:14:39,054 --> 01:14:41,159
Because of you?

832
01:14:42,103 --> 01:14:43,870
They're the best friends that i have

833
01:14:43,995 --> 01:14:46,894
but i don't know if we'll
ever be what the jsa was.

834
01:14:51,355 --> 01:14:53,367
You have to trust them.

835
01:14:55,701 --> 01:14:57,201
I do.

836
01:14:58,628 --> 01:15:02,060
You have to remember
they're people, too.

837
01:15:02,632 --> 01:15:05,180
They'll make mistakes.

838
01:15:06,011 --> 01:15:08,004
We all do.

839
01:15:14,704 --> 01:15:17,355
We all have to keep trying.

840
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:22,093
Isn't that what you said

841
01:15:22,218 --> 01:15:23,718
yeah.

842
01:15:28,804 --> 01:15:30,714
You know, i only learned to fly

843
01:15:30,839 --> 01:15:33,945
after my kingdom was attacked
and taken from me.

844
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:36,053
It was only then that i realized

845
01:15:36,178 --> 01:15:39,197
it wasn't the throne
that was important. It was my people...

846
01:15:46,355 --> 01:15:48,209
my wife.

847
01:15:51,858 --> 01:15:55,072
You have the capacity
to break the chains

848
01:15:55,197 --> 01:15:57,774
that are holding you down.

849
01:15:57,899 --> 01:16:01,783
And when you do, what doctor fate
envisioned will come to pass.

850
01:16:04,072 --> 01:16:07,475
You will soar higher
than any one of us.

851
01:16:09,248 --> 01:16:11,321
What about you?

852
01:16:11,446 --> 01:16:13,701
You gonna keep your wings locked up?

853
01:16:15,987 --> 01:16:17,087
No.

854
01:16:18,912 --> 01:16:20,012
No.

855
01:16:20,512 --> 01:16:23,367
No, i am putting people under them.

856
01:16:23,492 --> 01:16:25,205
Chloe helped courtney and i

857
01:16:25,560 --> 01:16:28,487
locate the remaining members
of the jsa,

858
01:16:28,612 --> 01:16:32,426
their children, and their protgs.

859
01:16:32,551 --> 01:16:34,745
I think the coming generation

860
01:16:34,870 --> 01:16:37,614
could stand to learn a thing
or two from...

861
01:16:37,739 --> 01:16:40,479
from those of us
that have done it before.

862
01:16:40,604 --> 01:16:43,048
Some of us already have.

863
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,441
The justice society lives again.

864
01:16:56,024 --> 01:16:58,492
So, what do you call
your team, anyway?

865
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:06,801
A work in progress.

866
01:17:19,790 --> 01:17:23,125
Those are some real party
animals you have as friends.

867
01:17:23,553 --> 01:17:25,848
If it isn't my favorite martian.

868
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:28,398
Looks like you're enjoying
the return of your powes.

869
01:17:28,523 --> 01:17:30,118
At a cost.

870
01:17:30,243 --> 01:17:33,428
Doctor fate's final act
was to restore my martian abilities

871
01:17:33,553 --> 01:17:36,016
instead of saving his own life.

872
01:17:36,141 --> 01:17:37,940
What happens to the helmet now?

873
01:17:38,065 --> 01:17:41,207
According to hawkman,
someone worthy will be drawn to it.

874
01:17:41,332 --> 01:17:43,449
They'll become the next doctor fate.

875
01:17:43,805 --> 01:17:45,756
What's next for you?

876
01:17:45,881 --> 01:17:49,286
My time as a detective
has allowed me to protect humans

877
01:17:49,411 --> 01:17:52,143
on a very personal
and individual level.

878
01:17:52,451 --> 01:17:54,280
I've enjoyed that.

879
01:17:55,171 --> 01:17:58,227
So i will continue to protect
and serve using every tool i've got.

880
01:17:59,121 --> 01:18:01,021
Me too.

881
01:18:03,772 --> 01:18:05,969
Doctor fate was inundated

882
01:18:06,094 --> 01:18:09,976
with a constant flow
of visions and inormation,

883
01:18:10,332 --> 01:18:12,729
but there is a limit to how
much knowledge someone can have.

884
01:18:13,941 --> 01:18:16,407
It drove him to the edge of sanity,

885
01:18:16,532 --> 01:18:18,515
and he fell off.

886
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:21,404
I don't need my telepathy
to know you run that risk yourself.

887
01:18:21,573 --> 01:18:23,954
A golden helmet
possessed by ancient spirits

888
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,556
and the watchtower are
two entirely different things.

889
01:18:26,681 --> 01:18:28,536
I can handle it.

890
01:18:30,770 --> 01:18:34,160
I only say because i care.

891
01:18:34,923 --> 01:18:38,101
You and clark, oliver...

892
01:18:41,213 --> 01:18:43,731
you're my family here.

893
01:18:46,453 --> 01:18:48,478
Anyone home?

894
01:18:48,603 --> 01:18:50,260
What's up?

895
01:18:52,073 --> 01:18:54,479
Nothing, actually.

896
01:18:56,272 --> 01:18:59,656
I thought i'd stop by
and see if anyone was hungry.

897
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:02,043
I could use some dinner.

898
01:19:07,656 --> 01:19:09,156
Sure.

899
01:19:10,038 --> 01:19:11,868
You're buying, mr. Queen.

900
01:19:11,993 --> 01:19:14,371
Don't look at me.
I'm living off a policeman's salary.

901
01:19:14,496 --> 01:19:17,614
- Fin. Dessert's on you.
- On mars, we never had dessert,

902
01:19:17,943 --> 01:19:20,449
but i have grown especially fond
of cookies.

903
01:19:35,712 --> 01:19:37,494
Front page, clark.

904
01:19:37,619 --> 01:19:39,763
Hey, congratulations.

905
01:19:39,888 --> 01:19:41,798
It's hard to believe
that a group of underdogs

906
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,634
- can be swept under the rug like that.
- At least, thanks to you,

907
01:19:44,759 --> 01:19:46,852
the world now knows
who these heroes are.

908
01:19:46,977 --> 01:19:49,400
Hopefully, we'll be seeing
more of them.

909
01:19:49,525 --> 01:19:53,325
The byline could have read,
"lois lane and clark kent."

910
01:19:54,035 --> 01:19:57,247
- Next time.
- Maybe.

911
01:19:57,372 --> 01:19:59,282
It's not every day
that you get an exclusive

912
01:19:59,407 --> 01:20:01,838
with a elmet head
that can tell you your fate.

913
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:09,511
So...

914
01:20:09,818 --> 01:20:12,319
he told you your fate?

915
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,460
Yeah.

916
01:20:17,729 --> 01:20:21,138
He was just babbling about
how i'd be there for him

917
01:20:21,263 --> 01:20:22,945
and he'd be there for me.

918
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:25,736
It just sounded like
a valentine's day card.

919
01:20:26,101 --> 01:20:28,347
Who's the him?

920
01:20:29,117 --> 01:20:31,110
It's ridiculous.

921
01:20:31,235 --> 01:20:34,809
I-i quote, "savior/sentient power."

922
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:41,215
Do you believe in fate, lois?

923
01:20:48,623 --> 01:20:50,970
Only the kind you make happen.

924
01:20:57,467 --> 01:21:00,210
I was already transferred
to three different prisons

925
01:21:00,335 --> 01:21:03,336
before i got here today!
Haven't eaten, haven't slept,

926
01:21:03,461 --> 01:21:05,749
and i'm burnin, damn it!

927
01:21:05,874 --> 01:21:08,409
I want to speak to her... now!

928
01:21:12,234 --> 01:21:13,924
The helmet.

929
01:21:14,049 --> 01:21:17,205
It messed with my mind.
It screwed me up.

930
01:21:17,552 --> 01:21:20,063
I'm well aware of the capabilities

931
01:21:20,188 --> 01:21:22,608
of doctor fate's helmet.

932
01:21:22,733 --> 01:21:26,015
Let me go back out there after
the justice society, agent waller.

933
01:21:26,140 --> 01:21:28,905
I can finsh what i started...

934
01:21:29,030 --> 01:21:31,441
what checkmate started.

935
01:21:31,566 --> 01:21:34,335
I can still take down the jsa
single-handedly.

936
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:36,813
You knocked on their door.

937
01:21:36,938 --> 01:21:39,416
You got them back into the game,

938
01:21:39,541 --> 01:21:41,384
back into the public eye.

939
01:21:41,509 --> 01:21:44,055
That's mission accomplished, icicle.

940
01:21:46,147 --> 01:21:49,359
That's all i needed you to do.

941
01:21:49,484 --> 01:21:50,984
What?

942
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:54,033
You don't have the talent to
take a team like that out.

943
01:21:55,627 --> 01:21:58,257
There's an army of heroes growing.

944
01:21:58,382 --> 01:22:01,216
This generation and the last
are coming together,

945
01:22:01,341 --> 01:22:05,188
and i'm gonna need them if we're
going to survive the apocalypse

946
01:22:05,313 --> 01:22:07,901
that's coming this way.

947
01:22:09,054 --> 01:22:11,370
Apocalypse?

948
01:22:12,018 --> 01:22:15,009
This is not what i signed up for.

949
01:22:15,703 --> 01:22:17,860
Oh, but is.

950
01:22:19,481 --> 01:22:22,770
Welcome to the suicide squad.

951
01:22:23,482 --> 01:22:25,689
Come on, then.

952
01:22:32,526 --> 01:22:34,561
Agent mercer.

953
01:22:38,526 --> 01:22:40,955
It's been a long time.

954
01:22:43,618 --> 01:22:45,906
We have a lot to catch up on.
