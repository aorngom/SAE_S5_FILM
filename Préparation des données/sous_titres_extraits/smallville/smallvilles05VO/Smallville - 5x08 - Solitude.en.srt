1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,193
Thank you for the lift.

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:16,954
With any luck, my car will be
out of the garage tomorrow.

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:18,917
Oh, bummer.
I love being your chauffeur.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,550
We can chat, and I get to spend
quality time with my new best friend.

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,994
I'm proud of you, Lois.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,720
Living in your own apartment,
buying a brand-new car.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,474
- You've really grown up.
- Oh, let's not get carried away.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:30,914
The car's my safety net.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,958
When I lose my job and apartment,
I'll need somewhere to sleep.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,239
- Thanks again.
- See you. Bye.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,038
Bye.

12
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,112
Shelby?

13
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,879
Mom? Mom. Mom.

14
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,189
Mom, wake up.

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,956
- Are you okay? Mom?
- L... I must have fainted.

16
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,952
I haven't eaten anything today.

17
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,479
That sound, flash of light,
what was that?

18
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,510
What are you talking about?

19
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,674
According to the Weather Bureau,
at 10:35 last night...

20
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,718
...other than a little rain,
there was nothing over Smallville.

21
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:52,758
- That doesn't rule out heat lightning.
- Nothing was reported.

22
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,276
Clark, most people are interested
in the forecast, not the past-cast.

23
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,749
- What's going on?
- Last night I heard a sound.

24
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,229
It sounded like thunder.
Then I saw a bright light.

25
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,630
Outside, I found my mom
unconscious in the field.

26
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,189
- Oh, my God.
- I thought she was struck by lightning.

27
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,555
- Is she all right?
- Fine, like nothing happened.

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,995
- That's the weird part.
- Maybe she passed out.

29
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,878
- Has she seen a doctor?
- This morning.

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,237
- They couldn't find anything wrong.
- Then why are you so worried?

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,994
I wanna know where that sound
and that light came from.

32
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,152
Maybe someone was setting off
fireworks in the field next to you.

33
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,517
Maybe your super hearing picked up
a car backfiring two counties away.

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,958
What does it matter? Your mom's fine.
You don't have anything to worry about.

35
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,789
All right, why do I feel like I'm getting
the abridged version of this story?

36
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,639
I think Jor-El might have
something to do with this.

37
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,597
Your biological father?

38
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,832
When I died and he brought me back,
he made a deal.

39
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,476
He's come back to collect.

40
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,918
Don't take this the wrong way,
but after 800 pictures...

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,548
<i>...you</i> don't get any prettier.

42
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,190
That's enough. Thanks, guys.

43
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,031
How about a latte?

44
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,397
Don't you find this just a tad <i>sleazy...</i>

45
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,677
...holding a campaign photo shoot
where Martha Kent works?

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,549
You might as well, I don't know,
go out to their farm and milk their cows.

47
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,111
In case you don't know where your
paycheck comes from, I own the Talon.

48
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,319
What don't you own? I guess now
you wanna own the government.

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,074
Why are you so angry, Lois?

50
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,673
What have I ever done to you?

51
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,718
You just remind me of
the pseudo-politicians I grew up around.

52
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,996
You know, men who bought their
way into office.

53
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:43,628
But do you really think
you can beat Jonathan Kent?

54
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,156
There must be enough dirt on you
to create a landmass the size of Texas.

55
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,039
Please, grab a shovel
and start digging.

56
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,430
I have nothing to hide.

57
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,956
Let me give you a little friendly advice:

58
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,668
Bow out of the race...

59
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,355
...before a pesky little squirrel
digs up one of your rotten acorns.

60
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,551
Well, thanks, Lois.

61
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,031
You know,
there's nothing more <i>valuable...</i>

62
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:13,115
...than the savvy political advice
of a muffin-peddling college dropout.

63
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,909
Speaking of, do you have
banana blueberry today?

64
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,393
Well, many humans believe
that Earth was created in seven days.

65
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,279
Surprised it took you that long
to trust me.

66
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,234
I wanna know more about Jor-EI.

67
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:38,433
What son doesn't wanna learn more
about his absentee father?

68
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,431
But like all great figures in history...

69
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,909
...he can only be understood
in the proper context.

70
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,799
- We must start at the beginning, Kal-EI.
- I don't have time.

71
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,758
I'm worried.
He's done something to my mother.

72
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,391
Is your concern based on the bargain
Jor-El made with you?

73
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,279
- How do you know about that?
- I know more than you imagine.

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,034
I've been keeping an eye on you
for months.

75
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,794
Does your mother have any
markings on her skin?

76
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,913
No.

77
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,389
Why? Does that have
something to do with Jor-EI?

78
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,993
All in due time.

79
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,628
He's my father.
I have the right to know about him.

80
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,588
- I agree. When you're ready.
- I'm ready now!

81
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,999
Impatience is
such a pathetic human trait.

82
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,352
I suppose it's to be expected from
someone raised by such a primitive race.

83
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,915
I happen to care a great deal
about this primitive race.

84
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,150
A lot more than I do about Krypton.

85
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,151
Waiting. Patiently.

86
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,790
A Kryptonian is teaching history
at Central Kansas University?

87
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,350
I didn't believe it either
until I saw him use his powers.

88
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,953
He can do everything I can.

89
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,759
You've seen meteor-infected people
do all kinds of things.

90
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,399
It doesn't mean he's Kryptonian.

91
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,836
He calls me Kal-EI.

92
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,479
And he knows about Krypton.

93
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,555
Clark, I want you
to steer clear of this fellow.

94
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,431
- Clark.
- I didn't have a choice.

95
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,037
What do you mean?
You always have a choice, son.

96
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,636
- I wanted to learn more about Jor-EI.
- I'll tell you what you need to know.

97
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,792
Every Kryptonian has been
hell-bent on death and destruction.

98
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,589
You can't judge an entire people by
the acts of a few. Clark is Kryptonian.

99
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,878
Kryptonian raised by human beings
with strong values.

100
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,589
Clark, we don't have any idea
who this professor really is.

101
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,398
He's done nothing but help so far.

102
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,710
He told me the truth about Lex.
He saved Lana.

103
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,758
- He took the Silver Kryptonite out of me.
- But why, Clark?

104
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,117
We have no idea
what his motives really are.

105
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,475
- I'Il...
- I'll get it, sweetheart.

106
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,433
Mom!

107
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,517
I can't feel my hand.

108
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,151
Oh, God. My shoulder's burning.

109
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,592
Dad, what did the doctor say?

110
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,479
They don't know what it is.
They gave us some antibiotics...

111
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,234
...and said I should call
if anything got worse. Come on.

112
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,470
They're just gonna
let her come home?

113
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,599
Clark, the doctor said
her vital signs are perfectly normal.

114
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,149
Normal? I found her unconscious
in the driveway.

115
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,311
That's anything but normal.

116
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,595
Is there something
you're not telling me, son?

117
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,833
I'm just worried about Mom.

118
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,230
Me too. But don't worry,
she's gonna be fine.

119
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,078
Come on.

120
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,392
Miss Sullivan.

121
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,717
Mr. Luthor. What are you doing here?

122
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,030
You have made it
to the major leagues.

123
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,833
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

124
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,713
Very, very nice.

125
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,152
You've done quite well for yourself.

126
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,072
I am certain that sooner than later...

127
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,472
...you're gonna be working upstairs
under the Tiffany lamps.

128
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,549
A big story certainly would
accelerate the process.

129
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,837
Not that obituaries...

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,436
...and wedding announcements
don't inspire scintillating journalism.

131
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,831
If you're trying to feed me
some sort of self-promoting fluff piece...

132
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,592
<i>...I'm</i> not interested.

133
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:18,435
You can put a tuxedo on the fiddler but
he's still gonna play the same old tune.

134
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,672
That's good. You should jot that down
and add it to your calendar.

135
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,114
I gotta go.

136
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:29,239
Your creative passion will always be
for the bizarre and the inexplicable.

137
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,233
That's why I think you're
the perfect reporter for this story.

138
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,790
You have one minute.

139
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,311
The clock is ticking.

140
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,235
It seems there is someone
at Central Kansas University...

141
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:51,191
...who has the astounding ability
to run at virtually the speed of light.

142
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,158
Have you ever heard of such a thing?

143
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,279
The school is located in Smallville,
meteor-freak capital of the world.

144
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,115
This person can lift an automobile
with one hand.

145
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,272
Can create fire
with the blink of an eye.

146
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,192
It's extraordinary.

147
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,115
It sounds like a bit of a stretch,
even for me. Do you have any proof?

148
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,989
If we had proof there wouldn't be
any need for investigative reporting.

149
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,154
The person's name is Milton Fine.

150
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,039
He is a professor of world history.

151
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,838
Why did you come to me?

152
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,593
Frankly?

153
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:30,028
I didn't think <i>TIME</i> magazine
would be interested.

154
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,435
Good day, Miss Sullivan.

155
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,199
Professor.

156
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,271
Are you shaking me down
for lecture notes?

157
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,431
Or are you ready to begin
independent study?

158
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,195
A mark showed up on my mom.
The doctors don't know what it is.

159
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,558
- Describe it to me.
- It's like a bruise with veiny strands.

160
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,792
- Did it start on her left shoulder?
- Yes.

161
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,752
Your father tortured his dissidents
on Krypton the same exact way.

162
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,512
What?

163
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,470
I don't suppose I can
hide the truth from you any longer.

164
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,798
He was a violent dictator.

165
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,191
He ruled over Krypton with an iron grip
of fear and intimidation.

166
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,592
Anybody who spoke out against him
was locked away.

167
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,554
Even the great
hero of the people, Zod.

168
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,399
If he hadn't been <i>captured...</i>

169
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,791
...Zod could have stopped your father
from eviscerating the planet.

170
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,838
My father destroyed Krypton?

171
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,951
Billions of people died.

172
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,473
But he made sure
his only son survived.

173
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,711
All so that one day
you could conquer the human race...

174
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,433
...and re-create Krypton on Earth.

175
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,911
Why should I believe you?

176
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,196
Believe what you will.

177
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,316
My concern is for your mother's health.
I need to see her immediately.

178
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,118
My wife needs medical attention.
You're obviously not a doctor.

179
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,714
Make this easier on both of us,
and get out of my way.

180
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,269
Dad, the doctors couldn't help.
Let him look at her.

181
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,557
- It's been a day and a half since you fell?
- Yes. Exactly.

182
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,392
Clark, go out and get the truck.

183
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,279
Martha, I'm taking you
back to the hospital. Come on.

184
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,635
The doctors can't treat her, Mr. Kent.
Trust me.

185
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:39,156
If they puncture her skin or
use medication it could kill her instantly.

186
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,357
- Why should I trust you?
- Because he's Kryptonian.

187
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,594
- This could be a Kryptonian disease.
- Clark.

188
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,437
- Mom? Mom?
- What's happening?

189
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,160
She needs a meteor rock.
Do you have a meteor rock?

190
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,115
- Dad, in the closet!
- Yeah.

191
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,508
It's on the top shelf.

192
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,113
Martha?

193
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,710
Hold it to her forehead.

194
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:07,236
Martha, Martha.
Breathe, Martha.

195
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,470
That's it. It's me.

196
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,154
It's working.

197
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,595
In this case,
appearances are deceiving.

198
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,471
There is no cure.

199
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:21,473
The meteor will only help
ease her pain.

200
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,315
- No.
- I'm sorry, Kal-EI.

201
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,677
Within a matter of hours,
your Earth mother will be dead.

202
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,914
Sweetheart.

203
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,478
- Where are you going?
- To see Jor-EI.

204
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,029
- Don't. He'll only feed you more lies.
- I don't care!

205
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,792
Hey, wait a minute.

206
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,872
Are you telling me
Jor-El is responsible for this?

207
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,433
What's going on, clark?

208
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,759
When Jor-El brought me back...

209
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,151
...he warned me someone close to me
would have to die.

210
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,949
So he is going after your mother.

211
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,388
And why didn't you
tell me about this before?

212
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,676
I didn't want you and Mom to worry.

213
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,190
You're the only one that has a chance
of stopping this, so do something.

214
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,591
I won't let him kill her.

215
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,312
Don't.

216
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,676
<i>Kal-EI, why have you come?</i>

217
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,432
Please...

218
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,712
...do whatever you want to me.

219
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,757
Leave my mother alone!

220
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,798
<i>I have caused your mother no harm.</i>

221
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,520
No! Don't lie to me!

222
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,955
If I'd have known
someone close to me would die...

223
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,599
<i>...I'd</i> have given up my life.

224
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,079
<i>It was you...</i>

225
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,357
<i>... who chose to give up your powers</i>
<i>and turn your back on me.</i>

226
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,715
Please let her live!

227
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:02,475
<i>I am sorry, my son.</i>

228
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,675
<i>The wheel of fate</i>
<i>has already been set in motion.</i>

229
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:10,391
<i>Even you cannot alter destiny.</i>

230
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,709
So, what am I looking at here?

231
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,029
It started 48 hours ago, and it's been
continuing on and off since.

232
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,599
What is it, a video glitch?

233
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,228
More like an electromagnetic
tidal wave.

234
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,868
- Good afternoon, Lex.
- Thank you.

235
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:45,635
Dad, if you've come to dispense a dose
of political advice, save your breath.

236
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,074
I know. I know, Lex.

237
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,630
You have a cadre
of top-shelf professionals for that.

238
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,677
I wonder...

239
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,716
...do they know of the sorts of things
you keep hidden behind closed doors?

240
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,077
You must be referring
to our deep, dark family secrets.

241
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,151
Don't worry, I won't embarrass you.

242
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:06,232
I'm talking about what you keep
in Warehouse 15.

243
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,831
If you wanna make up stories,
you won't be the first.

244
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,274
Just make it original.

245
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,193
It's not your campaign
I'm worried about, it's your legacy.

246
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,079
You don't want to end up an eccentric
like Howard Hughes...

247
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:23,916
...remembered more for his 10-inch
toenails than his contributions to society.

248
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:27,268
I'm afraid
you're the eccentric in the family, Dad.

249
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,829
Yes, but I'm not the one
running for public office.

250
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,912
Believe me, Lex,
the electorate has little patience...

251
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:36,038
...for candidates
obsessed with little green men.

252
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,637
It's time to get
your house in order, Lex.

253
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,229
Where's my smile?

254
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:46,790
Are you okay, Mom?
Can I get you anything?

255
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,558
Your father told me
about Jor-EI, Clark.

256
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,073
I want you to know...

257
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:58,755
<i>...I'm</i> more than ready to give up my life
for the life of my child.

258
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,116
Don't talk like that, Mom.

259
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:12,151
You've given me
so much happiness, Clark.

260
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,231
I don't know what I would've been
without you.

261
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,876
Without me, none of this
would have happened.

262
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,431
Don't ever feel guilty about this.
Do you hear me?

263
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,554
I wouldn't have it any other way.

264
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,990
You're gonna be fine.

265
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,190
Look at you.

266
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,155
You're a man now, clark.

267
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,680
A wonderful man.

268
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,872
My...

269
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,470
My job is done.

270
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,396
No, it's not, Mom.

271
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,471
You can't say that.

272
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,911
You have to fight this.

273
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,997
I love you, Clark.

274
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:13,559
And just because I'm <i>gone...</i>

275
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,520
<i>...it</i> doesn't mean
my love goes with me.

276
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,835
I will always be in your heart.

277
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,274
Always.

278
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,790
I'm not gonna let you die.

279
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,312
I won't let you.

280
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,198
Baby.

281
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:56,479
I don't mean to stop the presses,
but I have a favor, Chlo.

282
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,471
What else are cousins for? Shoot.

283
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,712
You once mentioned that Lex Luthor
spent time in the cuckoo's nest.

284
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,074
Why not write an exposé...

285
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,993
...on the mental stability
of the great bald hope of Kansas?

286
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,639
That would make a great story...

287
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:10,997
...if I could find any shred of evidence
or a source that would talk.

288
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,354
There has to be something.

289
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,193
There's lots of sex, lies and videotapes
in Lex's vault.

290
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,557
The problem is, he sleeps
with the key under his pillow.

291
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,631
Why the sudden urge
to take down Lex?

292
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,109
I'm just sick and tired
of rich powermongers...

293
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,999
...who think they can win an election
with their checkbook.

294
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:29,232
Not to mention the fact
that he called me a "muffin peddler."

295
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:35,350
- Oh, so basically he hurt your feelings.
- Sort of. But that's beside the point.

296
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,717
You have to have something
on that little hard drive of yours.

297
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,717
Actually clark's professor at cKU was
doing some investigating on LuthorCorp.

298
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:52,835
- Clark's professor?
- Yeah. He's writing a book.

299
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,878
I actually followed him
to a LuthorCorp warehouse downtown.

300
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,553
And what did you see?

301
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:01,190
Nothing. Thanks to a little thing
called security, I couldn't get near it.

302
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,918
Well, now you have your trusty sidekick
along for the ride.

303
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,269
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

304
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,158
Let's go.

305
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,758
- Hey.
- Maybe you can help me.

306
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:33,036
I'm trying to find the highway
and I'm lost.

307
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,031
Hold on. I got a map.

308
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,399
Go.

309
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,478
- You know, this is a really nice car.
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

310
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,031
You know, you can't fully appreciate
a car like this unless you sit in it.

311
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,509
- Really?
- Come on. Yeah.

312
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:03,194
- Okay.
- Just for a minute.

313
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,588
Go ahead.

314
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,513
Yeah.

315
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,799
- Ready for this? It's amazing.
- Yeah.

316
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,236
If you look there,
there's all sorts of really cool buttons.

317
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,436
Okay, you have a pop-up thingy.

318
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:24,115
Have a look. Yeah, you can put
things, like, I don't <i>know...</i>

319
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,716
...breath mints and all sorts of stuff.

320
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,749
Put coffee mugs.

321
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,151
- How's the stereo?
- It's fantastic. Turn it up.

322
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,709
And, yeah, well...

323
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:58,678
You know,
I really gotta get back to work.

324
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,596
Right. Okay.

325
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,269
I love a man in uniform.

326
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,554
Hey, how'd you get in here?

327
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,228
Attention. Cobra Niner.

328
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,832
<i>This is Three-four-niner, come in.</i>

329
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,554
Hey.

330
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,914
Thank you, Miss Andretti.

331
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,514
Hold it!

332
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,830
There's gotta be a way
to save my mom.

333
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,359
There must be. I'll do anything.

334
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,635
There is one option,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

335
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,398
What is it?

336
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,953
No matter how malevolent he is...

337
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,759
...Jor-El represents
your only connection with your past.

338
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,554
Just tell me what it is.

339
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,231
The only way to save your mother
is to destroy the Fortress.

340
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,479
Jor-EI's will is controlling her virus
through the crystals.

341
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,950
If you bring down his Fortress,
you will save your mother from his grip.

342
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,720
All he's ever done
is try to ruin my life.

343
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,798
Sadly, that was his legacy
on Krypton as well.

344
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,551
I want him gone.

345
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,912
If anyone is strong enough
to get through this...

346
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,235
<i>...it's</i> you, sweetheart.

347
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,311
You can't give up.

348
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,390
You can't give up.

349
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,354
I'll be right back.

350
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,554
Mr. Kent, I'm so sorry,
but I have to find Clark.

351
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,954
He's not here, chloe.

352
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,998
- He's with his professor, is he?
- Yeah, they went to the cave.

353
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:53,075
I've gotta get to him. Okay,
Milton Fine is not your ordinary Ph.D.

354
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,430
I know about him.
He's trying to help Martha.

355
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:00,277
I don't know how helpful
he's actually gonna be.

356
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,079
I'll tear this place down
piece by piece.

357
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,238
Just tell me where to start.

358
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,158
Right here.

359
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,312
Stab it into the console.

360
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,431
It'll trigger
a self-destruct mechanism...

361
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,149
...and Jor-El and his Fortress
will be forever gone.

362
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:48,399
- What is it?
- It was created to defeat your father.

363
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,870
But Zod was a man of peace.
He would only use it as a last resort.

364
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,832
There was never a chance.

365
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,358
There is now.

366
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,598
You will never hurt my family again.

367
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,315
I couldn't have done it without you.

368
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,755
You're the only one
who could affect the Fortress.

369
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,236
Now that you've accomplished your task,
you're just a petty annoyance.

370
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,591
The meteor rock.
You're not even Kryptonian, are you?

371
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,360
I was created by Kryptonians...

372
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,757
<i>...but</i> I'm a whole lot smarter.

373
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:36,713
You are free, General Zod.

374
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,758
Zod?

375
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,512
The one true Kryptonian.

376
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,998
Finally he will rid this fertile planet
of the scourge of humans...

377
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,833
...and create Krypton here on Earth.

378
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,951
Everything you said to me was a lie.

379
00:28:55,160 --> 00:29:01,474
When you were talking about Jor-EI,
you really were talking about Zod.

380
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:06,313
Jor-El didn't infect my mother, did he?
You did!

381
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,717
To think that you would sacrifice
your Kryptonian heritage...

382
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,950
...for a single <i>Homo sapien.</i>

383
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,833
You are a pitiful disgrace.

384
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,713
Goodbye, Kal-EI.

385
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:30,598
Welcome to our new home,
General Zod.

386
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,954
Clark?

387
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,714
Clark?

388
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,233
Chloe.

389
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,190
Oh, my God!

390
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,199
It's gone.

391
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:17,549
Hey, you.

392
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,513
Mom, you okay?

393
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,315
Yeah. It's amazing how wonderful
a rainstorm smells...

394
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,914
...after you think
you'll never smell one again.

395
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,631
I can't imagine what it would be like
if you were gone.

396
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,713
The hardest thing in life
is losing the people you love.

397
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,389
But you'd learn to move on.
We all do.

398
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,636
It wouldn't be easy.

399
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,436
Dad's given me so much,
I could never measure it.

400
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,390
But you're my heart. My soul.

401
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,674
Well, I...

402
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,316
I don't plan on going anywhere
for a long, long time.

403
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,954
Good.

404
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,949
You know, next time I head up north,
I've got to remember to pack a parka.

405
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,832
How'd you get up there, anyway?

406
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,239
You left your key in the cave.

407
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,875
Seriously, Clark,
you've gotta be more careful.

408
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,072
I mean, if I can get up there,
anyone can.

409
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:41,437
You know, Professor Fine said
that human beings were insignificant...

410
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,511
<i>...and</i> couldn't be depended on.

411
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:48,553
- He obviously didn't know you very well.
- Please.

412
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:52,275
Robo-professor knows as much
about human nature as R2-D2.

413
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,311
What was he, anyway?

414
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,034
I saw him materialize from a bunch of
nuts and bolts...

415
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,918
...that spilled out of the spaceship.

416
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,275
Some sort of Kryptonian
artificial intelligence.

417
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,192
And what did he want with you?

418
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,399
He wanted me to help him free
a rebel Kryptonian named Zod.

419
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,553
What I still don't understand
is how you got onto Fine's trail.

420
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,955
You're not gonna like this very much.

421
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,350
Lionel Luthor gave me the lead.

422
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,794
Lionel?

423
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,758
- How'd he know about Fine?
- I have no clue.

424
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,871
I hope he doesn't know
about the spaceship.

425
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,430
You should get ahold of that thing
before somebody else beats you to it.

426
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,874
There's a problem.

427
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,470
I checked out that warehouse
you told me about. The ship's gone.

428
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,234
Well, the master of the shell game
must have moved it.

429
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,357
- Or...
- Or what?

430
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,509
Or I have bigger problem
than I thought.

431
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,437
Lex.

432
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:58,319
Your message sounded urgent.

433
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,277
You all right?

434
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,599
I thought you were past
your kleptomania stage, Dad.

435
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,034
But I guess old habits die hard.

436
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,594
If you are accusing me
of some sort of thievery...

437
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:17,038
...I assure you, son, I have no interest
in your little baubles and trinkets.

438
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,515
You seemed interested
in what was in my warehouse.

439
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,037
What'd you do? Pay off my security?
Bribe my scientists?

440
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,313
You're telling me you misplaced
your most prized possession?

441
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,994
Oh, Lex, Lex.
How many times have I told you.

442
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,073
If you don't keep an eye on the things
you value, they will disappear.

443
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,236
I want it back now!

444
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,628
I wish I could oblige...

445
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:42,389
...but, sadly, I had nothing to do
with this unfortunate heist.

446
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:45,751
I don't know what happened to you
in that meteor shower, Dad.

447
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,469
But you're more connected to what was
in that warehouse than I ever realized.

448
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,638
Please be careful, Lex.
You're a fragile man.

449
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:56,276
I don't wanna see you shattered again
by your delusions.

450
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,272
Tell me you've managed to dig up
at least a speck of dirt on Lex.

451
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,670
I'll take an unpaid parking ticket
at this point.

452
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,350
I told you, Lex keeps his dirty laundry
in a cast-iron hamper.

453
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,869
I might have done this at first
because of pride...

454
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,712
...but then I started to worry...

455
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,679
...what would Lex Luthor do
with the power of public office?

456
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,871
He's gonna try to rule the world.

457
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,873
- Lf you're that worried, do something.
- I plan to.

458
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,749
But the one thing I plan on not doing
is poking around inside his warehouses.

459
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,434
I can't believe after that
<i>Charlie's Angels</i> escapade...

460
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,229
...all you found in there was fertilizer.
- It wasn't a complete waste of time.

461
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,676
No? What did we manage to do
besides put a scratch on my new car?

462
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,230
You got to experience
the chills and thrills of journalism.

463
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,312
Thanks, but no, thanks.

464
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,833
I don't know how you do it.

465
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,912
Chasing story after story
that only leads to dead ends.

466
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,553
I'd never be able to let go.

467
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,271
That's usually how it starts.

468
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,119
Hey.

469
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,114
I know how hard all this has
been on you. How you holding up?

470
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,519
I just don't know
how I could be so gullible.

471
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,911
- I believed everything he said.
- I would've done the same thing, son.

472
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:53,270
You were trying to save your mother.

473
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:56,354
Luckily, she's safe now.

474
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,637
I think the best thing we can do
is just put all this behind us...

475
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:02,075
...and move on with our lives,
don't you?

476
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,196
I'm not so sure.

477
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,193
Jor-EI's warning is still out there.

478
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,632
Clark...

479
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,878
<i>...your</i> mother's virus was caused
by Fine, not by Jor-EI.

480
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,599
He hasn't done anything yet.

481
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,832
And for all we know,
he might never do anything.

482
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,238
Dad, we both know that Jor-EI's
not the type to just let things go.

483
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:33,480
Clark, when it comes down to it,
none of us are gonna be around forever.

484
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,678
Now, we can't dwell on that.

485
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:40,590
I think the trick is to just
live your life to its fullest.

486
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,590
Make sure you spend as much time
as you possibly can...

487
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,631
...with the people you love.

488
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,679
You're right.

489
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,998
Yeah.

490
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,631
