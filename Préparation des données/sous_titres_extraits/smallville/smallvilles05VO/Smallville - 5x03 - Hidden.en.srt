1
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,877
Take out your key.

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,758
You're out of your mind.

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,952
I wouldn't expect you to understand.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,393
Look, just take out your key.

5
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,154
- No. No.
- Do it!

6
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,872
Tom.

7
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,150
- No.
- You know what to do.

8
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,151
Don't do it, Tom.

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,399
- I'll kill him.
- Don't listen to him.

10
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,350
We can't let this happen.

11
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,315
Tom, no!

12
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,789
On three.

13
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,794
- One, two, three.
- Don't do it! Don't do it!

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,996
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,399
Hey, Gabriel. I'm surprised MIT
even lets you converse...

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,790
...with us pedestrian
Met-Uers so early.

17
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,589
- <i>Chloe, you have to get out of town.</i>
- I've been trying since yesterday.

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,150
I had no idea "just the necessities"
would take so long to pack.

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,312
Listen to me, Chloe.
Pretty soon, it's all gonna be over.

20
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,038
I know it sucks to say goodbye.

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,714
But if Smallville managed
without their cyberwizard...

22
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,440
<i>...I'm</i> sure they'll survive
without their star reporter.

23
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,639
Chloe, you're the one person
who will understand why I had to do it.

24
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,238
<i>You have to make people realize</i>
<i>it wasn 't my choice.</i>

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,479
It's the only way.

26
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,156
Gabriel, what are you talking about?

27
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,239
How much time did I spend at the <i>Torch</i>
helping you chase the big story?

28
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,514
<i>In one hour,</i>
<i>you're finally gonna get it.</i>

29
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,591
What happens in an hour?

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,432
Smallville's finally
gonna be gone forever.

31
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,559
<i>DEFCON 1. Countdown commencing.</i>

32
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,159
Hi.

33
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,593
Hi.

34
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:56,629
That was the best night's sleep
I've had in weeks.

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,514
<i>Thanks for listening.</i>
<i>It's just about 6:30 on a sunny...</i>

36
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,955
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

37
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,355
How did we fall asleep?

38
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,431
I told you we should've
gone to the Talon.

39
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,357
How can that hurt so much?

40
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:17,432
All right, look. Okay, my dad's
not gonna be up for 15 minutes.

41
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,194
Then we gotta get out of here.
You gotta get out of here.

42
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,510
Sticking around
for breakfast sounds like fun.

43
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,755
What?

44
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,629
Pass me my shoe.
"We won't fall asleep, I promise."

45
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,234
What else are we gonna do
at 2:00 in the morning?

46
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,789
- Look, you're not mad, are you?
- I'm furious.

47
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,398
Come on.

48
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,797
Hey, Clark, what...?

49
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,916
Mr. And Mrs. Kent.

50
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,874
I can explain.

51
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,996
Clark and I made
this decision together...

52
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,631
<i>...so</i> if you're angry,
you should be angry at both of us.

53
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,159
We... We're not mad.

54
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,630
It... But this is an...

55
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,068
You're <i>both...</i>

56
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,193
...in new territory.

57
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,152
Lana, this is about a whole lot
more than just you.

58
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,074
So if you don't mind, I'd like
to speak to my son alone, please.

59
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,990
You sit down.

60
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,993
Just... Just remember, I am 18.

61
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:03,119
I've been in love with Lana since I was 7,
so it's not like we rushed into something.

62
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,431
Please tell me you were at least safe.

63
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,349
- Yeah, Mom.
- Safe?

64
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,158
Safe has got nothing
to do with this.

65
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,039
You shouldn't be doing anything
like this under our roof.

66
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,077
- Like you didn't do it?
- Clark.

67
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,435
There's a lot of conversations
we didn't have.

68
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,398
- I didn't think we needed to.
- You guys think I'm not normal.

69
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,471
No, no. It... It...
It's just that...

70
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,551
You're just so much
more vulnerable now...

71
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,239
...without your powers.

72
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,799
Knock, knock.

73
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,996
Okay, I just passed Lana
flying out of here.

74
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,835
What would she be doing here
at 6:30 in...?

75
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,518
So, chloe, clark said you're...
You're off to Met U today.

76
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,240
Looks like you're getting an early start.

77
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,869
Not without one last
"why me?" moment, though.

78
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,235
I got a cryptic call
from Gabriel Duncan.

79
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,793
The tech guy from the <i>Torch?</i>

80
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,195
Yeah, well, I guess
today's my lucky <i>day...</i>

81
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,119
...because he said that Smallville
is going to be history...

82
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,477
...in exactly 53 minutes.

83
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,989
Have you spoken to Sheriff Adams
about this, Chloe?

84
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,514
I think I've used up my limit
of "cry wolfs" with her.

85
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,876
Why don't you find Gabriel.

86
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,349
I'll speak to the sheriff myself.

87
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,556
Early morning or late night?

88
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:40,154
What the hell are you doing here?

89
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,715
I've been admiring your sketches.

90
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,395
I didn't mean to pry.

91
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,312
No, of course not.

92
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,358
You were just going through my things
to get better acquainted.

93
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,239
- You can't just come in here.
- I didn't mean to rattle you.

94
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,039
There was no answer,
so I started to get concerned.

95
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,037
Lex, I'm fine.

96
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,915
Are you sure about that?

97
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,517
Look, I just wanna talk about
what you saw that day.

98
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,274
Weren't you the person who told me
I was hallucinating...

99
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,034
...last time I mentioned a spaceship?

100
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,439
Lana...

101
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,156
...I might have appeared skeptical,
but I still believed in you.

102
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,237
That's why I sent
an expert to the site.

103
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,358
Whatever caused that crater
was not a meteor.

104
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,269
Have you talked
to anyone else about this?

105
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,759
Like Clark?

106
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,799
You know, when you start rambling
about spaceships and aliens...

107
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,428
...people kind of look at you funny.

108
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,872
Well, they must not have
the same faith in you that I do.

109
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,757
You're not crazy.

110
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,314
Sheriff Adams,
can I speak to you for a minute?

111
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,074
It's nothing to worry about.
It's just a routine drill.

112
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,356
It's a routine drill
at the Hamstead farm, huh?

113
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,748
What...?

114
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,037
Wouldn't have anything to do
with the missile silo in their field?

115
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,270
Why don't you go on
back to your truck.

116
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,040
It's no secret the government
put these things out here.

117
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,077
I just thought
they decommissioned them.

118
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,670
Mr. Kent, thank you, we've got it
all under control. Thank you very much.

119
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,469
Why don't you just relax, sir,
and let us do our job.

120
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,674
Officers can stand down.

121
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,194
There isn't even a missile in here.

122
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,952
This is a false alarm.

123
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,394
Not exactly.

124
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,199
That signal did not come from
in here. It was rerouted.

125
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,352
There are at least 15 silos
that are still active in the county.

126
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,033
He could be in any one of them.

127
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,992
<i>Missile tracking unlocked. Enter revised</i>
<i>coordinates for new point of impact.</i>

128
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,312
Gabriel.

129
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,396
It's locked.

130
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,118
We call it "plan B."

131
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,989
It's for those of us who can't
crush metal with our bare hands.

132
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,838
Hello.

133
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,035
Gabriel? Colonel Duncan?
Is anybody here?

134
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,152
Find anything?

135
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:27,555
Does the fact that Gabriel's father was
a not-so-retired military colonel count?

136
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,790
These briefs are only a few weeks old.

137
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,959
A colonel with an aerospace
engineering degree from Purdue?

138
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,474
Do you think that he might be
the lighthouse keeper...

139
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,312
...for the local nuclear missiles?

140
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,351
Wall of Weird times 100.

141
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,476
Well, looks like Gabriel was giving you
a run for your money.

142
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,950
Yeah, I'd say he lapped me
a few times.

143
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,351
Why would he be so obsessed
with meteor freaks?

144
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,239
Oh, come on.
Now, journalistic curiosity is one thing...

145
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,836
...but papier-mâchéing your walls
with them is another.

146
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,753
Call me conventional, but shouldn't this
have been a red flag for Gabriel's dad?

147
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,795
I just... If Gabriel was so determined
to go atomic on the meteor epidemic...

148
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,518
<i>...why</i> didn't his dad stop him?

149
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,557
Looks like he tried.

150
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,679
I expected results by now.

151
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,432
- Mr. Luthor...
- Why isn't this open?

152
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,511
That laser uses technology
so cutting edge...

153
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,240
<i>...even</i> the military doesn't
know about it. We've tried.

154
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,516
Luthorcorp doesn't believe
in finite solutions.

155
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,318
I'm not sure you understand, sir.

156
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,710
We've used every
chemical compound that exists.

157
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,110
Every alloy of metal,
every method known to man.

158
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,477
Which would clearly suggest
that this craft isn't known to man.

159
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:11,713
So I recommend you and your team
start thinking out of the box.

160
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,111
- I'm... I'm trying to explain...
- For every question, there is an answer.

161
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,995
Now, if you find
that task too challenging...

162
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,594
<i>...I'll</i> recruit someone who doesn't.

163
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,111
Find a way in.

164
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,192
Wait.

165
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,110
I didn't see this before.

166
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,031
That's because it wasn't there.

167
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,480
I don't know how they'll check
15 silos in 40 minutes.

168
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:46,155
Well, neither can you anymore, Clark,
if that's what you're thinking.

169
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,909
- It's rough being regular flesh and blood.
- Never stopped you.

170
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,872
Of all the people in Smallville,
you're the only one he warned.

171
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,869
- He just wants me to tell his story.
- Either way, he trusts you.

172
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,793
Maybe we don't need
to search every silo.

173
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,038
- Hello.
- <i>Gabriel. Hi, l... I need your help.</i>

174
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,431
I started to leave town, then I was
freaked out when I was driving.

175
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,398
And then this dog
ran out on the road and l...

176
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,232
Chloe, slow down. What happened?

177
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,949
L... I guess I must have overcorrected,
and I ran my car into a ditch.

178
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,396
And I can't get it started now.
I'm really scared.

179
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,516
- Can you help me?
- Where are you?

180
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,598
<i>Route 87, near the old mill.</i>

181
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:34,951
Okay, just hang on.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

182
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,278
Tell me what the symbols mean.

183
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,439
I'm not buying it, Dad.

184
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,231
You're in there.

185
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,591
You've been obsessively
drawing these for weeks.

186
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,955
They're identical
to the markings on the ship.

187
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,956
You'll never open it.

188
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,710
Only he can open it.

189
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,595
Gabriel, I'm sorry.
Everything happened so fast.

190
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,274
- I didn't know who to call.
- It's all right. Come with me.

191
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,317
- You'll be safe there.
- Gabriel.

192
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,030
Which silos did you activate?

193
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:36,558
I trusted you.

194
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,638
Whatever your reasons for doing this,
killing's not the answer.

195
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,151
You're wrong, clark.

196
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,117
It's the only answer.

197
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,708
Clark! Clark! No!

198
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,713
- You can't just leave him, he's gonna die!
- Don't fight me.

199
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,711
- Clark! No!
- Chloe, you have to trust me!

200
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,154
No!

201
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,911
Farmer heard the shot
and found him on 87.

202
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,593
Male, 18, gunshot wound to chest.

203
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,478
Massive bleeding.
Vitals are unstable.

204
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,677
We need to intubate now.
Prep him for the OR immediately.

205
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,318
- Clark?
- How serious is it, doc?

206
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,870
Can't tell until I open him up.
It looks like the bullet pierced his lung.

207
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,076
- Bullet?
- Sorry, I'm gonna have to ask <i>you...</i>

208
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,992
...to stay in the waiting area.

209
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,397
Gabriel, Clark could die out there.

210
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,070
In 20 minutes none of it
will matter, Chloe.

211
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,268
<i>Missile trajectory locked.</i>

212
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,908
<i>Latitude 37 north.</i>

213
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,275
You're gonna kill
everyone in Smallville.

214
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,317
How could you do that?

215
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,630
It's not that difficult.

216
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,800
The fail-safes were programmed
back in 1979.

217
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:21,155
It only takes a moderate genius
to bypass them.

218
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,675
You don't watch your dad
do the same drill for 10 years...

219
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,558
...and not pick up a thing or two.

220
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,036
Don't look at me like that, chloe.

221
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,157
You're safe here, okay?

222
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,833
With me.

223
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,753
Besides, you're getting
what you always wanted.

224
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,592
The story of a lifetime.

225
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,876
You actually think
I care about that right now?

226
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,957
You should care.

227
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,317
The last meteor shower left 10 times
as much rock to infect people...

228
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,799
...than the last one.

229
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,350
Pretty soon, there's gonna be
more psychos running around this town.

230
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,590
This is the only way to end it.

231
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,432
It's my one chance to be a hero.

232
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,996
So you're exterminating
a few meteor freaks...

233
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,799
...by sacrificing
the lives of innocent people?

234
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,791
Innocent?

235
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:24,033
Every single one of those mutants
was innocent before the meteor showers.

236
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,316
My dad warned me
to stay away from the rocks...

237
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,313
...because they turned
people into mutants.

238
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,111
Your dad?

239
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,834
Were those his articles
on the wall?

240
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,550
He tried to warn people.

241
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,473
He said the meteors were
destroying the town.

242
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,836
No one would listen.

243
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,196
Then during the last one...

244
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,670
...he became one of them.

245
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,596
You know, a lot of people think
special abilities are a gift.

246
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:01,233
You didn't have to kill him
just because he wasn't normal anymore.

247
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,157
He asked me to.

248
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,476
No one wants to live like that, Chloe.

249
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,149
Pretty soon, no one will have to.

250
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,473
I don't even know
if you can hear me...

251
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,831
...but I need you to know...

252
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,315
...that from the first moment
that I saw you...

253
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:12,634
...I knew that no one could
make me happier than you.

254
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,353
But I also knew
that you'd never change.

255
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,718
You'd... You'd always be running around,
trying to save the day.

256
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,873
All those times I pulled away...

257
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,516
<i>...it's</i> because I knew
this day would come.

258
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,748
- You're not supposed to be in here.
- Please, you need to clear the room.

259
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,070
Charging 200. Clear.

260
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,432
Charging 300. Clear.

261
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:20,549
Charging 300. Clear.

262
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:29,515
Three-fifty. Clear.

263
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,871
Okay, I'm calling it.

264
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,469
Time of death, 7: 18 a.m.

265
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,669
Oh, my God.

266
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,395
Miss Lang. Miss Lang.

267
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,792
Oh, no.

268
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,111
Mr. And Mrs. Kent...

269
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,830
...we did everything we could...
- No.

270
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,638
...but we lost him.

271
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:27,677
Doctor, we have a problem
with the Kent boy.

272
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,520
<i>Two minutes to launch.</i>

273
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,271
<i>Lockdown initiated.</i>

274
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,951
<i>Seal outer doors.</i>

275
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,756
<i>Security level four.</i>

276
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,230
<i>Warning systems on.</i>

277
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,909
<i>Access denied.</i>

278
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,833
<i>Final launch sequence initiated.</i>

279
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,359
<i>Access denied.</i>

280
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,310
<i>Lockdown complete.</i>
<i>Sixty seconds to ignition.</i>

281
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,390
Oh, God.

282
00:24:56,920 --> 00:25:00,196
Why couldn't you understand?
This is the only way!

283
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:12,188
<i>Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...</i>

284
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:18,276
<i>... five, four, three, two, ignition.</i>

285
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,759
Hello, Kal-EI.

286
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,079
How do you know to call me that?

287
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,151
You're my son.

288
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,152
Jor-EI?

289
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:10,040
And I hope the time is coming when
you will call me father.

290
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,959
I was...

291
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,111
I was just at the hospital. How did...?

292
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:17,713
How did you get me here?

293
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,632
The portal in the cave.

294
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,510
When this body was activated
by the crystal, it became a...

295
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,716
An oracle of Kryptonian knowledge.

296
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:34,635
A vessel for me to inhabit
if ever you should need me.

297
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,199
That time was now.

298
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,557
Am I dead?

299
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,197
Your mortal journey is over, yes.

300
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,035
But your imminent destiny
is too important to be sacrificed.

301
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,997
You will return...

302
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,913
...with all your natural gifts.

303
00:26:54,760 --> 00:27:00,995
Unfortunately, this rectification
does not come without a price.

304
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,396
The life of someone close to you
will be exchanged for yours.

305
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,519
No.

306
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,636
No, I would never ask for that.

307
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,510
You already did when you decided
to relinquish your powers and disobey me.

308
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,193
It was your choice.

309
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,836
Then just don't bring me back.

310
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,317
It's too late.

311
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,070
For everything in nature,
there is a balance.

312
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:52,079
The life force that has been returned
to you will soon be taken from...

313
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,359
From someone you love.

314
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,508
You're about to face
your darkest hour, my son.

315
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,834
But remember...

316
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,719
...the lessons
that we learn from pain...

317
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,713
...are the ones
that make us the strongest.

318
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:24,477
Always know that I love you.

319
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,469
Clark.

320
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,919
The hospital lost our son.

321
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,992
If I had any idea what happened...

322
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,469
<i>...I</i> wouldn't have to call the police,
now would I?

323
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,838
Listen, I want you to get ahold of
Sheriff Adams and send her over there.

324
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,594
- I have to call you back.
- Clark.

325
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:17,078
Oh, Clark. Clark.

326
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,834
Son. They told us you were dead.

327
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,509
Yeah...

328
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,838
I was.

329
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,829
- Jor-EI?
- Yeah.

330
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,269
He returned your powers, didn't he?

331
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,230
I'm not human anymore.

332
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:54,315
It was the only way
I could come back.

333
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,791
We heard about a missile malfunction.

334
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,793
You stopped it, didn't you?

335
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,074
It's not easy to sacrifice
the thing you want the most...

336
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,992
...to save other people.

337
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,720
We're so proud of you, clark.

338
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,989
The real sacrifice would've been
not coming back at all.

339
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,113
Son.

340
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,074
After all those threats...

341
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:39,710
...Jor-El just decided to offer
to give you your powers back?

342
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,510
He didn't ask for anything in return?

343
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,559
No.

344
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,830
Mr. And Mrs. Kent?

345
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,278
Clark.

346
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,549
Lana.

347
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:21,234
I heard about clark's resurrection.

348
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,034
You know, I've... I've never
really believed in miracles...

349
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,192
<i>...but</i> I've certainly done my share
of asking for them today.

350
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,191
Me too.

351
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,158
But I think that
we have different reasons.

352
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,275
It's clark's medical file.

353
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,317
That's confidential.

354
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,994
I heard you asked for it at the hospital.

355
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,557
All of his test results
came back normal.

356
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:59,317
When are you gonna realize, Lex,
that he is just like the rest of us?

357
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,278
Do you really believe that?

358
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,955
Or is that what you have to tell yourself
to stay in a relationship with him?

359
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,509
You've had doubts about him too.
You can't deny it.

360
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:13,318
I was wrong.

361
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:18,111
Believe me, there's nothing
unusual about Clark...

362
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:21,875
...except his ability to see the good
in people who don't deserve it.

363
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,753
I think you're
forgetting something, Lana.

364
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,154
Whatever new lie he told you...

365
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,914
...however he swept it under the rug...

366
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,517
...a normal person
doesn't rise from the dead.

367
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,673
Aren't you gonna
give your old dad a hug?

368
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,399
I was told you were missing
from Belle Reve.

369
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,516
Man, I don't understand.
You've been nearly catatonic for weeks.

370
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,280
Didn't I just overhear you say
you'd been looking for miracles all day?

371
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,751
Looks like I'm it.

372
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,276
So maybe now
you can tell me why you've...

373
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,032
You've been wandering <i>around...</i>

374
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,158
...mumbling things like
"Krypton" and "Kal-EI."

375
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,551
Krypton? Kal-EI? I <i>don't...</i>

376
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,669
The last thing I remember
is standing here arguing with you.

377
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,676
That was weeks ago.

378
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,234
Okay.

379
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,595
You don't recognize these?

380
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,954
Looks like something from the cave.
What is it?

381
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,351
I found you carving them
with a corkscrew.

382
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,557
Oh, wasn't I creative.

383
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,917
I wish that I could unlock
the labyrinth of my subconscious.

384
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,150
I'm sorry to disappoint you, son.

385
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,476
I have my father back.

386
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,676
What's to disappoint?

387
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,277
If anything, I'd say
this is cause for celebration.

388
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,796
When Kansas didn't merge
with Oklahoma today...

389
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,110
...I kind of guessed you were involved.

390
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,951
Looks like you're okay.

391
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,557
You don't look too bad yourself.

392
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,438
For a dead guy.

393
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,668
I heard what happened at the hospital.

394
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:49,113
You went and got your powers back,
didn't you?

395
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,915
I didn't have a choice.

396
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,231
I know how much
you've dreamt of <i>having...</i>

397
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,029
...a bland, mundane, generic life...

398
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,873
...but being normal is highly overrated.

399
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,069
And besides, it makes my whole
sidekick role a lot easier...

400
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,674
...if you can bring super-duper
strength to the table.

401
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:23,709
I mean, not that we didn't make
a great team out there today...

402
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,350
...minus the whole part where
I was kidnapped and you were shot.

403
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,239
So...

404
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,394
...are you healing,
or how does that work exactly?

405
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,035
Unscathed on the surface.

406
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,397
But that's not what's going on
underneath, is it, Clark?

407
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,556
I guess I'll never be able
to escape who I really am.

408
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,836
Back to the lies...

409
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,872
...and hoping no one
will ever ask to see the scar.

410
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,996
Namely, Lana?

411
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,198
- We've never talked about Lana...
- That's because we don't need to, clark.

412
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,396
I'm a big girl now.

413
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,788
I do have one confession.

414
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:39,836
I really liked being
the only one who knew all about...

415
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,878
...you know, you.

416
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,752
For lack of a cheesier word,
it just made it...

417
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,959
...special.

418
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,909
But if you honestly believe that you can
stay with Lana and not tell her...

419
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,150
<i>...I</i> think you're
seriously kidding yourself.

420
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,996
I don't have a choice.

421
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,074
I can't expect her to react like you did.

422
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,318
But don't you think
you owe her the choice?

423
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,276
I can't take that risk.

424
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,394
I've risked too much already.

425
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:34,632
And now someone else
is gonna have to pay for it.

426
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,876
Clark, is everything okay?

427
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,792
What's going on?

428
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,599
I never should've given up my powers.

429
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,638
Why didn't I listen to him?

430
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,673
Chloe, I think
I've made a terrible mistake.

431
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,511
