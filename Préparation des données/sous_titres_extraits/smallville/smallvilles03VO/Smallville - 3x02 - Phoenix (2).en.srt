1
00:01:22,506 --> 00:01:24,531
Looks like the old man
has been working out!

2
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,075
Jor-El and I have an understanding.

3
00:01:27,244 --> 00:01:28,541
I'm taking you home.

4
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:31,773
I don't care what he's done to you.
You're not taking me anywhere.

5
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:49,930
Clark!

6
00:01:53,037 --> 00:01:57,269
You don't realize how dangerous you are
when you're wearing that ring.

7
00:01:58,342 --> 00:02:00,810
It's not the ring. I was born that way.

8
00:02:00,978 --> 00:02:03,139
You just can't accept it.

9
00:02:53,831 --> 00:02:56,766
What in the hell did Jor-El
do to you, Clark?

10
00:02:56,934 --> 00:03:00,995
He made sure I'd never forget
who my real father is.

11
00:03:17,188 --> 00:03:18,450
Go on.

12
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:21,285
Do it.

13
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:27,193
If I could raise a son
that could kill, then kill!

14
00:03:48,452 --> 00:03:49,783
Dad.

15
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:53,781
Dad? Dad.

16
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:57,588
Clark.

17
00:03:57,761 --> 00:03:59,251
Dad.

18
00:05:10,501 --> 00:05:12,526
-Clark.
-Mom.

19
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,671
Oh, Clark!

20
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,198
Mom.

21
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:22,208
I am so sorry, Mom, for everything.
For the baby--

22
00:05:22,379 --> 00:05:24,973
We never blamed you.

23
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:30,777
-Oh, my God!
-Dad.

24
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,719
-What happened?
-Whatever Jor-El did...

25
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,052
...must've been too much
for his body to handle.

26
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:39,684
The important thing is that Clark is
back home with us now.

27
00:05:52,142 --> 00:05:56,511
Abraham threw lsaac on the pyre
to prove his faith to God.

28
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,340
What was your excuse?

29
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:03,383
Lex?

30
00:06:06,223 --> 00:06:08,088
Son.

31
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,389
Disappointed I'm not basking
in the fires of hell?

32
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:12,824
Lex...

33
00:06:13,797 --> 00:06:15,264
...put the gun down.

34
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:17,400
Sorry I screwed up your plan.

35
00:06:18,035 --> 00:06:21,334
Why would I murder
my own flesh and blood?

36
00:06:21,972 --> 00:06:23,599
Son...

37
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:28,545
-...you're not yourself.
-I'm feeling more like myself than ever.

38
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:30,873
What the hell did you do with Helen?

39
00:06:31,048 --> 00:06:33,209
She's living very comfortably
in your mansion.

40
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:35,215
Why don't you ask her.

41
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,120
-She's alive?
-Yes.

42
00:06:39,289 --> 00:06:42,486
And she told a truly harrowing
tale of survival...

43
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:45,686
...that left you
quite the posthumous hero.

44
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,957
She said the pilot took your money
and bailed out.

45
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:52,034
-Lex, we're going down!
-There must be parachutes!

46
00:06:54,571 --> 00:06:57,404
There's only one. Come on!

47
00:06:57,574 --> 00:06:59,303
I'm not going without you!

48
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:04,743
Count to three and pull.
They'll send a rescue plane for you.

49
00:07:05,015 --> 00:07:06,846
Lex.

50
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:08,446
I love you.

51
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:14,081
Now, go.

52
00:07:15,459 --> 00:07:17,552
Quite a story, don't you think?

53
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,596
A sacrificial death that would make
any father proud.

54
00:07:21,765 --> 00:07:26,202
But something tells me that's not
what really happened, Lex.

55
00:07:28,205 --> 00:07:32,198
-I warned you not to trust her, Lex.
-Don't turn this on Helen!

56
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:35,304
You had my name carved into a tombstone!

57
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,505
I had search parties scouring
half the world for you.

58
00:07:38,782 --> 00:07:41,148
Looks like you picked the wrong half.

59
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:44,720
What would I have to gain from your death?

60
00:07:46,156 --> 00:07:47,418
Lex.

61
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:52,392
As your widow, Helen just became
one of the richest women in the world.

62
00:07:52,563 --> 00:07:54,155
Helen never cared about the money.

63
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:57,459
Oh, but she did, Lex.

64
00:07:58,802 --> 00:08:03,899
Ask her what happened to the vial with the
blood sample after you returned it to her.

65
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,240
Dad, I just don't get it.

66
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,715
Why would Jor-El help bring me back...

67
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:17,217
...when he's the one
who wanted me to leave?

68
00:08:21,158 --> 00:08:23,786
You made a deal with him, didn't you?

69
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,223
Clark...

70
00:08:25,863 --> 00:08:30,800
...the most important thing right now
is that my son has his life back.

71
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,404
I'm not sure I want it back.

72
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:42,040
And being Kal-El,
I could just do whatever I wanted.

73
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:45,181
It was like this huge weight
had been lifted off me.

74
00:08:45,349 --> 00:08:49,285
Look, I'm not saying that staying
is gonna solve all your problems...

75
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:53,048
...but at least this way we can face it
together as a family.

76
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,726
I wish it were that easy.

77
00:08:59,329 --> 00:09:00,694
What is that?

78
00:09:00,864 --> 00:09:02,525
I don't know.

79
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:06,330
This guy, Morgan Edge,
hired me to steal it.

80
00:09:06,503 --> 00:09:10,098
-Clark, you gotta take this thing back.
-Dad...

81
00:09:10,274 --> 00:09:12,970
...I stole it from Lionel Luthor.

82
00:09:18,816 --> 00:09:22,308
We better find out exactly what it is
we're dealing with.

83
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:33,324
That's my blood, isn't it?

84
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:49,204
It's your blood.

85
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,075
Do you think Lionel knows?

86
00:09:52,249 --> 00:09:56,982
Helen told me she never labeled it
before somebody stole it from her office.

87
00:09:57,154 --> 00:09:59,213
Why would Lionel want my blood?

88
00:10:01,425 --> 00:10:02,915
It doesn't matter now.

89
00:10:05,128 --> 00:10:07,528
I'm starting to wonder
what he really knows about me.

90
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:10,758
We've managed to stay
one step ahead of Lionel Luthor so far.

91
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:14,631
Why don't you just focus on people
closer to home, okay?

92
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,245
I like Scotch.

93
00:10:23,413 --> 00:10:27,850
-What's this?
-It's our old special. A Suicide.

94
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:32,678
I hope your tastes haven't changed.

95
00:10:33,857 --> 00:10:36,587
Nothing ever changes, Lionel.

96
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:42,093
Not even when you dress it up
in a designer suit or a penthouse office.

97
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:46,828
Yeah, it's sad the same thing
can't be said about friendship.

98
00:10:48,372 --> 00:10:53,241
I kind of suspected you had an inside
contact, but I gotta hand it to you.

99
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,241
Very creative.

100
00:10:57,915 --> 00:11:00,110
Buying off my daughter-in-law...

101
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,275
...that's even low for you, Morgan.

102
00:11:02,786 --> 00:11:04,276
Oh, well.

103
00:11:07,591 --> 00:11:10,583
All right, all right,
let me guess, let me guess.

104
00:11:10,761 --> 00:11:14,629
The idea was to steal the vial
and sell it back to me...

105
00:11:14,798 --> 00:11:17,323
...at a healthy markup, right?

106
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:20,732
What are you gonna do, have me
charged with breaking and entering?

107
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:25,500
Why settle for breaking and entering?
I can have you put away for good.

108
00:11:26,376 --> 00:11:28,344
I'd be careful, Lionel.

109
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:32,806
-You've got a lot further to fall.
-Yeah.

110
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,008
But I'm the one who's got the evidence.

111
00:11:35,185 --> 00:11:41,488
And remember, the statute of limitations
on murder never runs out.

112
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:45,624
You got 24 hours to get that vial
back to me.

113
00:11:58,809 --> 00:12:01,243
-Hi.
-Hi?

114
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,507
I don't even know
what to say to that, Clark.

115
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,789
I'm sorry...

116
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:18,018
...for the way I acted in Metropolis.

117
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,629
I really messed things up.

118
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:26,496
I keep telling myself that it wasn't you.

119
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,932
But...

120
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:32,439
...then I think back on all the things
that have happened, and I realize...

121
00:12:32,609 --> 00:12:35,510
...that I don't know who you really are.

122
00:12:40,984 --> 00:12:44,044
I know you need an explanation.

123
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,189
No, I don't.

124
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,548
You warned me there were things
about you that I wouldn't understand.

125
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:55,658
I guess I just didn't want to believe it.

126
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,568
I was protecting you.

127
00:13:02,739 --> 00:13:04,604
From what?

128
00:13:05,475 --> 00:13:07,943
That's the part I can't figure out,
because, Clark...

129
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:12,172
...the only thing
that keeps hurting me is you.

130
00:13:19,122 --> 00:13:22,489
After everything you said
before you left...

131
00:13:26,863 --> 00:13:29,161
...did you even miss me?

132
00:13:32,836 --> 00:13:35,031
I missed you every second.

133
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:45,304
But I can't keep doing this to you.

134
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,613
Then don't.

135
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:03,596
Lana, I'm not sure if I'm even gonna stay.

136
00:14:11,775 --> 00:14:15,006
Well, when you decide, let me know.

137
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,448
Home sweet home.

138
00:14:53,049 --> 00:14:57,008
Lex. Oh, thank God!

139
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,711
Trust me, I've done that already.

140
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:02,882
He seems to be the only one
on my side lately.

141
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:07,792
But the rescue, it was called off. How...?

142
00:15:07,964 --> 00:15:10,262
Small fishing boat spotted the smoke
from my fire.

143
00:15:10,433 --> 00:15:12,901
I never gave up hoping.

144
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,995
Just in case, it was certainly generous
of you to make me out to be a hero.

145
00:15:17,174 --> 00:15:20,200
I'm so sorry, Lex.
I shouldn't have lied to everyone.

146
00:15:21,278 --> 00:15:23,576
-So why did you?
-I just couldn't face...

147
00:15:23,747 --> 00:15:26,079
...what really happened up there.

148
00:15:29,452 --> 00:15:32,285
I woke up to find the pilot parachuting
from the plane...

149
00:15:32,455 --> 00:15:35,390
...just like I told everyone.
I couldn 't wake you.

150
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,221
Lex! Lex!

151
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,659
I realized you drank a whole glass
of champagne...

152
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,027
...and I only had a sip.
We must've been drugged.

153
00:15:45,035 --> 00:15:48,163
The plane was going down, and I panicked.

154
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:53,872
You always think that you're gonna be
brave in a situation like that...

155
00:15:54,044 --> 00:15:59,448
...but when it really happens, I guess,
your survival instincts kick in.

156
00:15:59,616 --> 00:16:01,584
Survival of the fittest.

157
00:16:02,452 --> 00:16:05,046
I guess you really are a Luthor now.

158
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,651
You don't believe me?

159
00:16:10,827 --> 00:16:12,920
I know you worked for my father.

160
00:16:14,331 --> 00:16:17,858
After I gave you the blood back
and apologized...

161
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:20,400
...you turned around and sold it to him.

162
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,767
Your father said if I gave him the blood,
he'd leave us alone forever.

163
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,340
He's playing us against each other.

164
00:16:27,344 --> 00:16:30,074
We seem to do a good job
of that on our own.

165
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:37,552
If you want to annul this marriage,
I'll get out of your life.

166
00:16:46,796 --> 00:16:49,060
But for what it's worth...

167
00:16:52,002 --> 00:16:54,766
...I do love you.

168
00:17:25,835 --> 00:17:30,863
I must admit, this is the last place
I expected you to show up.

169
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,407
How'd you find me?

170
00:17:33,576 --> 00:17:37,376
-Where's my package?
-I don't have it.

171
00:17:40,183 --> 00:17:43,209
I wonder if the cops want to know
where you are.

172
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:49,017
I don't think you heard me!

173
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:53,428
The package is gone!

174
00:17:53,596 --> 00:17:56,326
Luthor doesn't know who took it,
so forget about it!

175
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:58,558
Take your hands off of him right now!

176
00:17:58,735 --> 00:18:00,225
I said, now!

177
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:08,707
Take your sorry ass down the road
back to Metropolis.

178
00:18:09,412 --> 00:18:12,404
I don't want to see you
in Smallville again. Ever.

179
00:18:47,283 --> 00:18:49,843
Kind of far from your new hood,
aren't you, Clark?

180
00:18:53,022 --> 00:18:55,388
I just came to say thank you.

181
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:56,957
Oh, it's one of those days.

182
00:18:57,127 --> 00:19:02,565
Because I can never tell with you whether
it's gonna be an apology or an accusation.

183
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,900
Chloe, I gave you absolutely no reason
to stand by me.

184
00:19:08,805 --> 00:19:11,205
But you knew where I was
all summer and didn't tell.

185
00:19:11,374 --> 00:19:14,172
Yeah, well, that's what friends
do for each other, Clark.

186
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:18,006
Talk to Lana yet?

187
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,014
I tried.

188
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:27,489
That's it?

189
00:19:28,591 --> 00:19:32,960
After two years of nonstop Lana-lusting,
that's the best you can do? Come on.

190
00:19:33,963 --> 00:19:35,555
I think it's for the best.

191
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:41,362
You're not staying, are you?

192
00:19:43,406 --> 00:19:45,169
I haven't made up my mind yet.

193
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:47,502
You can't keep running away, Clark.

194
00:19:47,677 --> 00:19:49,167
We all do things we regret.

195
00:19:49,345 --> 00:19:53,179
Sometimes you have to stop
and face your demons.

196
00:20:10,099 --> 00:20:12,795
Am I too early for the farm auction?

197
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,200
Lex?

198
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,334
Three months on a deserted island
was almost worth it...

199
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,978
...to see the look on your face right now.

200
00:20:27,784 --> 00:20:29,081
Oh, man!

201
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:33,115
Lex, we thought you died.

202
00:20:33,289 --> 00:20:35,723
Well, apparently, fate has
bigger plans for me.

203
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:39,390
I heard about the farm.

204
00:20:39,562 --> 00:20:41,154
Anything I can do?

205
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:43,731
No, Lex, you know my dad.

206
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:49,102
It's good to see you.

207
00:20:50,173 --> 00:20:52,334
What happened?

208
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,807
Something I didn't know I was capable of.

209
00:20:55,845 --> 00:21:00,373
It's ironic. In the most remote solitude,
I still manage to find an enemy.

210
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:04,216
I suppose I was just hallucinating
from malaria.

211
00:21:04,387 --> 00:21:06,685
But the enemy I found was real.

212
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,885
I got a good look at myself.

213
00:21:10,059 --> 00:21:12,857
Or at least the part
I've always tried to ignore.

214
00:21:16,132 --> 00:21:17,531
Lex, l--

215
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,500
I guess we all gotta take a look
at our dark side sooner or later.

216
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,168
The problem is,
if you stare at it long enough...

217
00:21:27,343 --> 00:21:29,743
...it can get hard to tell the two sides apart.

218
00:21:39,222 --> 00:21:40,553
Hey.

219
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:45,953
-You can't keep avoiding me, Lana.
-I'm not avoiding you.

220
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:48,256
I worked late,
and I ran errands this morning.

221
00:21:48,431 --> 00:21:50,160
At 5¡G30 in the morning?

222
00:21:51,367 --> 00:21:54,962
You want to cut the pretenses? Fine.
You lied to me about Clark.

223
00:21:55,138 --> 00:21:57,698
Something we have in common, then.

224
00:21:57,874 --> 00:22:02,436
I have apologized to you 1 00 times
for not telling you about Clark and me.

225
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,079
You're right, and I'm over it.

226
00:22:04,247 --> 00:22:06,306
So let me say I'm sorry.
We can call it even.

227
00:22:06,482 --> 00:22:09,940
Chloe, this is so much bigger than me.
How could you let everyone worry?

228
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:13,054
Because the more pressure I put on him,
the more he pulled away.

229
00:22:13,222 --> 00:22:14,484
I mean, you saw him, Lana.

230
00:22:14,657 --> 00:22:18,354
He wasn't the charming flannel king we
all know and love. It was like he was--

231
00:22:18,528 --> 00:22:20,155
A different person.

232
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:21,797
Yeah.

233
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:26,368
Let's face it, Lana,
Clark has more issues than Rolling Stone.

234
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:34,266
Look, I know what I did was wrong.

235
00:22:34,677 --> 00:22:36,611
And as much as I hate to admit it...

236
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:41,045
...it felt really good being
the person he confided in again.

237
00:22:43,419 --> 00:22:47,150
Clark's always been more comfortable
talking to you.

238
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:49,382
It's because he's not in love with me.

239
00:22:55,031 --> 00:22:57,090
That didn't take long.

240
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,698
I thought I'd leave for a while,
give you some space to think things over.

241
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:04,134
Hey.

242
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:09,543
I've had more than enough space
the last few months.

243
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,379
I'd rather share it with someone.

244
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,680
I thought we can give the honeymoon
a second try.

245
00:23:18,454 --> 00:23:20,854
You don't let go of things, Lex.
I know you.

246
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,686
Yes, you do.

247
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,819
You and I understand each other
because we're similar creatures.

248
00:23:27,997 --> 00:23:30,397
We've both done our share
of maneuvering.

249
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:34,726
In a twisted way, I guess that's
why we're perfect for each other.

250
00:23:34,904 --> 00:23:37,839
I want to be with you, Lex.

251
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,940
But you know your father
will never leave us alone.

252
00:23:43,112 --> 00:23:45,012
Don't worry.

253
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:49,379
I have a feeling he won't be
interfering in our lives anymore.

254
00:23:55,758 --> 00:23:59,091
-Hey, Mom! Dad!
-Yes, Kal.

255
00:24:01,798 --> 00:24:03,925
Didn't I tell you not to ever
come back here?

256
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:08,503
I wanted to meet the parents.
Nice people.

257
00:24:09,605 --> 00:24:13,803
-Mom.
-I wouldn't do that if I were you.

258
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,770
Clark! Son.

259
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:20,314
Don't do anything. It's okay.

260
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:24,852
I know you're quick, but you can't
get to both of them at the same time.

261
00:24:29,692 --> 00:24:32,058
I don't have what you're looking for.

262
00:24:32,228 --> 00:24:36,028
Do you want me to explain that
to Lionel Luthor?

263
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,194
-No, Clark--
-Wait!

264
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:42,968
Stop.

265
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,500
Clark!

266
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,871
What the hell is this?

267
00:26:00,616 --> 00:26:03,050
It's what you're looking for.

268
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,619
It better be.

269
00:26:28,077 --> 00:26:30,705
Extraordinary how the smell
of creosote and algae...

270
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,508
...can take you back 30 years, isn't it?

271
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:39,086
-A lot of memories buried here.
-Yeah, where they belong.

272
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:44,652
Don't tell me I've come
all the way out here for nothing.

273
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:50,532
Intriguing presentation.

274
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,069
It's not the packaging that is important.

275
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:57,673
-Unless you don't trust me.
-Trust you?

276
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,606
Trust has never had anything
to do with our friendship.

277
00:27:25,534 --> 00:27:27,058
It's identical.

278
00:27:27,236 --> 00:27:29,170
Excellent.

279
00:27:35,244 --> 00:27:39,078
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think the blood was liquid gold.

280
00:27:40,149 --> 00:27:43,118
I can't imagine what the real source
would be worth to you.

281
00:27:43,653 --> 00:27:45,814
Unfortunately,
the source is a mystery to me.

282
00:27:45,988 --> 00:27:50,789
My contact turned out to be,
let's say, uncooperative.

283
00:27:51,394 --> 00:27:53,555
They were holding out on you.

284
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:08,133
What if I were to tell you that this is
not the sample I stole?

285
00:28:10,046 --> 00:28:12,947
I got this straight from the source.

286
00:28:28,564 --> 00:28:30,293
Jonathan!

287
00:28:33,436 --> 00:28:34,733
Yeah.

288
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,431
Yes, sir.

289
00:28:37,907 --> 00:28:41,673
That was Edge. He wants us
to bring the kid to him.

290
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:09,694
Do you know where the Kents are?

291
00:29:11,774 --> 00:29:13,105
Move it!

292
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,610
Lana.

293
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:20,407
Please leave her out of this.

294
00:29:54,383 --> 00:29:55,816
Lana.

295
00:30:01,724 --> 00:30:04,158
To a second chance.

296
00:30:06,295 --> 00:30:07,728
You're not drinking?

297
00:30:07,897 --> 00:30:11,025
Well, I sort of lost
my taste for champagne.

298
00:30:11,767 --> 00:30:13,894
Did you sleep well last night?

299
00:30:14,403 --> 00:30:17,668
The first good night's sleep
I've had since the accident.

300
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,171
I'm glad.

301
00:30:19,341 --> 00:30:23,573
Because it is our honeymoon,
and I'd hate for you to doze off.

302
00:30:25,181 --> 00:30:28,014
You never know.
You might wake up to find me gone.

303
00:30:30,719 --> 00:30:32,550
Lex, that's not funny.

304
00:30:34,356 --> 00:30:36,517
I guess you had to be there.

305
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:41,495
You know what?

306
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,427
I am gonna have a drink.

307
00:30:45,601 --> 00:30:47,535
What's going on?

308
00:30:49,505 --> 00:30:53,236
I was so relieved when you forgave me
for stealing the blood...

309
00:30:53,409 --> 00:30:58,870
...that I failed to realize
no rational person would've done that.

310
00:30:59,582 --> 00:31:02,176
I did it because I love you.

311
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:09,185
You still think I tried to kill you?

312
00:31:11,293 --> 00:31:13,887
Why can't you see what's
right in front of your eyes?

313
00:31:14,063 --> 00:31:17,362
It was your father's plane.
He's always been threatened by you.

314
00:31:17,533 --> 00:31:23,130
You're right. You see, I haven't been able
to stop thinking about the accident.

315
00:31:23,305 --> 00:31:26,934
And there is something that's been
right in front of my eyes.

316
00:31:29,311 --> 00:31:33,577
If my father wanted me dead,
he wouldn't have failed.

317
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:38,511
You're experiencing residual delusions.
It's a common aftereffect of the malaria.

318
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:42,418
I'm afraid I've been delusional
a lot longer than three months.

319
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:46,019
But I think I have a pretty clear
picture of things now.

320
00:31:47,096 --> 00:31:51,260
You had my father's pilot killed
and snuck your own on board.

321
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,568
You had the pilot touch down
on a small island and drop you off.

322
00:31:57,006 --> 00:32:01,568
You paid him a prearranged sum to take
the plane up again with me still inside.

323
00:32:05,181 --> 00:32:07,809
He flew out far enough
to cover your tracks...

324
00:32:07,983 --> 00:32:11,384
...and then he took a little skydive.

325
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:15,991
I'm guessing he had a pretty ugly surprise
when he tried to open his parachute.

326
00:32:17,726 --> 00:32:21,628
Believe me, I prefer your version,
where I'm the gallant hero...

327
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:24,595
... but that' s not giving you
enough credit, is it?

328
00:32:24,767 --> 00:32:26,166
Lex, you're scaring me.

329
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:28,326
The area where we crashed
was unreachable...

330
00:32:28,504 --> 00:32:32,497
...given the amount of fuel we started with.
I checked all the islands in the vicinity.

331
00:32:32,675 --> 00:32:36,736
You touched down on St. Croix
at 7:59 that night.

332
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:40,405
You know what the most
twisted part of all this is?

333
00:32:43,953 --> 00:32:47,081
Is the reason you didn't get a bullet
in your head that day...

334
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,748
...was because I really did
fall in love with you.

335
00:32:52,628 --> 00:32:54,118
But don't worry.

336
00:32:54,363 --> 00:32:56,126
I learn from my mistakes.

337
00:33:01,937 --> 00:33:03,234
Go ahead.

338
00:33:04,473 --> 00:33:07,033
I've become quite adept
at cheating death.

339
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:12,480
In fact, I have no doubt
that I'll rise from the ashes again.

340
00:34:33,228 --> 00:34:35,196
I hate mysteries.

341
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,832
-Or did you forget that?
-You're gonna like this one.

342
00:34:47,242 --> 00:34:48,937
This had better be worth it, Morgan.

343
00:35:05,361 --> 00:35:07,556
We gotta get you out of here.

344
00:35:07,996 --> 00:35:09,463
You set me up!

345
00:35:09,631 --> 00:35:12,794
-You set me up!
-Lionel, I don't know what happened!

346
00:35:12,968 --> 00:35:14,629
You set me up!

347
00:35:14,803 --> 00:35:18,899
There was nobody in that truck!
There was nobody in that truck!

348
00:35:36,525 --> 00:35:38,584
Mr. Luthor, I gotta get you out of here.

349
00:35:39,128 --> 00:35:41,528
-Morgan.
-Let's go, Mr. Luthor!

350
00:35:41,697 --> 00:35:43,164
I've gotta get you out of here!

351
00:35:43,332 --> 00:35:46,859
Where is he? Where's Morgan?

352
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:48,730
Go!

353
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:19,031
Well done, Lex.

354
00:36:19,201 --> 00:36:20,691
Well done.

355
00:36:21,303 --> 00:36:25,501
That was a Machiavellian maneuver
worthy of a Luthor.

356
00:36:25,674 --> 00:36:28,734
I appreciate the kudos, but I don't
know what you're talking about.

357
00:36:28,911 --> 00:36:34,406
Come on, Lex, do you think I'd neglect
to put surveillance on my planes?

358
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:38,444
Poor Helen.

359
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,350
Should we be sending out
a search party for her?

360
00:36:41,523 --> 00:36:43,423
I have someone on it.

361
00:36:44,326 --> 00:36:48,695
But if Helen survived, I doubt anyone
will find her until she wants them to.

362
00:36:49,331 --> 00:36:54,769
You know, Lex, I never imagined
that you would fall in love with Helen.

363
00:36:55,137 --> 00:36:58,766
I'm sorry it happened, son,
but don't be too hard on yourself.

364
00:37:01,043 --> 00:37:02,772
You know the sick thing?

365
00:37:05,247 --> 00:37:09,650
Of all people, I knew you'd understand.

366
00:37:09,818 --> 00:37:11,080
I do.

367
00:37:11,253 --> 00:37:13,653
Survival is what matters in life.

368
00:37:13,822 --> 00:37:15,790
I know that now.

369
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:21,557
If I was anybody's else son,
I would've died on that island.

370
00:37:22,664 --> 00:37:24,689
All the tests you put me through...

371
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,927
...made me a survivor.

372
00:37:29,771 --> 00:37:33,298
If I can keep my pride in check,
I know there's more to learn from you.

373
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:41,214
I was hoping your offer still stands
to run LuthorCorp together.

374
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:50,416
I don't want you making
a hasty decision, Lex.

375
00:37:50,592 --> 00:37:53,254
You've just been through
an incredibly traumatic ordeal.

376
00:37:53,428 --> 00:37:55,123
No.

377
00:37:55,297 --> 00:37:58,357
I've learned to trust my instincts.

378
00:38:09,811 --> 00:38:11,836
Good to have you back.

379
00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:14,881
Son.

380
00:38:29,731 --> 00:38:32,029
It won't seem right
calling any other place home.

381
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,828
It's not the place
that makes the home, Dad.

382
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:36,903
Does that mean you're coming with us?

383
00:38:37,072 --> 00:38:40,508
I've kind of closed the door
on my time in Metropolis.

384
00:38:42,678 --> 00:38:46,512
I called the police and told them
where the money is that I stole.

385
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:52,413
You can't run away from the problem
when the real problem is in your blood.

386
00:38:53,155 --> 00:38:54,588
Hey.

387
00:38:54,756 --> 00:38:57,122
Clark, don't be so hard on yourself.

388
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,059
Hi, Lex.

389
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:05,995
You missed the garage sale. But we have
tons of these macrame plant holders left.

390
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:09,069
Thanks, Clark, but I'm actually
doing my own share...

391
00:39:09,237 --> 00:39:11,262
...of purging around the mansion.

392
00:39:20,582 --> 00:39:23,346
-You bought our farm?
-I put your names in the deed.

393
00:39:23,518 --> 00:39:26,612
-We can't accept this.
-Accept nothing but my gratitude.

394
00:39:26,788 --> 00:39:29,951
-Lex--
-After the plane went down...

395
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:32,992
...I made my way onto
one of the broken wings.

396
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:38,796
This compass, your wedding present...

397
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:40,935
...guided me to safe harbor.

398
00:39:41,203 --> 00:39:44,468
The least I can do is help you
keep your farm.

399
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:52,440
We will find a way to pay you back.

400
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:55,948
I'm not worried about that, Mr. Kent.

401
00:39:56,118 --> 00:39:58,313
If it's not too presumptuous...

402
00:40:00,122 --> 00:40:03,091
...I hope you'll just consider me
part of the family.

403
00:40:26,214 --> 00:40:27,579
Hi, Lana.

404
00:40:31,153 --> 00:40:34,122
Glad your parents are getting
a second chance.

405
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:39,084
Yeah, I think I'll be earning every cent
of my allowance this year.

406
00:40:39,261 --> 00:40:40,888
So you're staying?

407
00:40:42,564 --> 00:40:46,898
I think I wanna try to put all the stuff
that happened in Metropolis behind me.

408
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,936
Probably be a good idea if we put
a lot of things behind us.

409
00:40:50,772 --> 00:40:52,467
I was just thinking that too.

410
00:40:54,276 --> 00:40:59,213
Clark, I know there are things about you
that you try to shield me from...

411
00:41:00,716 --> 00:41:03,378
...but you don't have to protect
me anymore.

412
00:41:06,955 --> 00:41:09,287
Whatever it is, I can handle it.

413
00:41:11,126 --> 00:41:13,651
I really want to know you.

414
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:24,398
Lana, the way you looked
at me in Metropolis....

415
00:41:24,573 --> 00:41:27,736
-You were disgusted.
-No, I was confused.

416
00:41:27,909 --> 00:41:31,140
-You can't blame me for that.
-I don't blame you.

417
00:41:33,081 --> 00:41:35,982
But I can't stand for you to ever
look at me that way again.

418
00:41:36,151 --> 00:41:38,779
You weren't yourself.

419
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:41,786
Yes, I was.

420
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:50,462
Lana, I chose to let that part of me out,
and it's always gonna be there.

421
00:41:50,999 --> 00:41:54,662
Trust me, you don't want to know me
the way you think you do.

422
00:41:55,637 --> 00:41:58,401
Clark, that's my decision to make.

423
00:42:01,877 --> 00:42:03,504
Lana, I'm sorry.

424
00:42:06,515 --> 00:42:07,777
I wanted this so much.

425
00:42:07,949 --> 00:42:11,885
All last year, I tried so hard
to be the right guy for you.

426
00:42:19,227 --> 00:42:20,592
But I'm not.

427
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:24,631
This will never work.

428
00:42:43,518 --> 00:42:46,544
Clark, you never had to try.

429
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:55,000
