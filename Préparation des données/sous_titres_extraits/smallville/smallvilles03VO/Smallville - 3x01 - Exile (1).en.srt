1
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,567
I like this car. How much is it?

2
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,331
If you have to ask, you can't afford it.

3
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:14,768
Try me.

4
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,043
Two hundred and forty thousand.

5
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:20,540
This should cover it.

6
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:26,982
Why don't we take it for a test drive?

7
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,566
Cool ride, Kal.

8
00:01:45,371 --> 00:01:46,838
You like it?

9
00:01:47,006 --> 00:01:48,997
It's yours.

10
00:01:49,175 --> 00:01:50,472
Keep it.

11
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:11,253
So, Kal, where are you from?

12
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,991
Someplace I'm trying to forget.

13
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:17,298
Me too.

14
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,847
What is that?

15
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:30,676
It's a birthmark.

16
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,580
-It's pretty big for a birthmark.
-Don't touch.

17
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,154
That hurt. Jerk.

18
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:43,692
What's the deal, Kal?

19
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:47,526
Every night you roll in here with a babe,
and you always leave empty-handed.

20
00:02:47,767 --> 00:02:49,701
What are you, a monk or something?

21
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:54,169
What's the point of starting something
if it's just gonna end badly?

22
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,379
Hello?

23
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,616
Clark, is that you?

24
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,258
Please come home.

25
00:05:16,282 --> 00:05:17,840
Everyone on the floor now!

26
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:21,513
-Stay down!
-Don't move!

27
00:05:21,688 --> 00:05:24,054
You too! What?
What, you got a problem?

28
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,257
I said get the hell down!

29
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:28,758
-We gotta go!
-Hit the floor! Get down!

30
00:05:30,596 --> 00:05:33,497
Stay down, face down!
Hit the floor!

31
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,175
Get that bastard!

32
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,065
Stick to balloon animals.

33
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,806
Sorry, Krusty, I saw the bank first.

34
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,091
Come out with your hands in the air.

35
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,969
-Drop the bag!
-Put your hands up!

36
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,835
Drop the bag!
This is your final warning!

37
00:07:45,164 --> 00:07:47,962
-His crimes keep getting bigger
-We can't be sure it's Clark.

38
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:51,399
Look, I know you don't
wanna believe it, but....

39
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,232
It's him.

40
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,340
-What will we do?
-There isn't anything--

41
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,444
Yeah. You get in the truck.
I'm gonna get my coat.

42
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,773
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to get him.

43
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:08,520
He knows what red kryptonite does.
He can take that ring off anytime--

44
00:08:08,688 --> 00:08:12,146
-Martha, I don't know that.
-The phone calls, they're the first step.

45
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,260
I can't just sit around this farmhouse
and do nothing anymore.

46
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:19,228
Even if you find him, how exactly
do you plan on bringing him home?

47
00:08:19,398 --> 00:08:21,161
It's been three months.

48
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,792
We've been searching all that time.
We filed a missing person's report.

49
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,962
-We have done everything we can.
-Martha--

50
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:31,405
The fact is,
Clark doesn't want to be found.

51
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,840
He'll come home to us
when he's ready.

52
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,711
We just have to have faith.

53
00:08:41,754 --> 00:08:44,382
-Okay?
-Yeah.

54
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:58,303
Hey. I haven't seen you in a week.
I wondered if we still lived together.

55
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,802
I'm swamped here.

56
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,964
Your dad said you spent
the afternoon at the Daily Planet.

57
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,077
As far as my editor is concerned,
picking up his dry cleaning...

58
00:09:06,245 --> 00:09:09,408
...is more of a priority than meeting
with a junior columnist.

59
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,709
I thought maybe we could have lunch.

60
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:12,942
I can't.

61
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:17,316
With Lex gone, the Talon's been relegated
to LuthorCorp accountants...

62
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,926
...who have no interest
in a coffee shop in Smallville.

63
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,187
Okay. Well, if you need
a ride to Lex's funeral...

64
00:09:24,363 --> 00:09:27,491
...I'm always available
for chauffeuring and moral support.

65
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,128
Thanks. I'm going with the Kents.

66
00:09:31,637 --> 00:09:33,036
Have you heard from Clark?

67
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:36,441
I was thinking of staying
in Metropolis with Nell for a few days.

68
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:40,010
I feel guilty I haven't spent
more time searching for him.

69
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,340
He's not lost, Lana.

70
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:44,506
You may have written him off...

71
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:46,208
...but I can't give up hope.

72
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:49,113
Clark ran away.
He made a conscious decision...

73
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:53,952
...to leave his friends, his family
and the girl he claimed to love.

74
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:59,727
I know we've said our piece
about what happened...

75
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,029
...and we can keep avoiding each other,
but the fact is, I'm worried about you.

76
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,398
I'm the last person
you need to worry about.

77
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,034
Pining over Clark
only leads to personal misery.

78
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:10,505
Trust me, I wrote the book.

79
00:10:10,676 --> 00:10:13,338
Now you need to move on.
He obviously has.

80
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,640
I don't believe that.

81
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,377
I just think he's waiting
for the right person to find him.

82
00:10:59,892 --> 00:11:01,553
-Who sent you?
-I did.

83
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,229
Morgan Edge.

84
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:13,369
That's a hell of a scar.
How'd you get it?

85
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,038
My dad's a real bastard.

86
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:22,573
What do you want?

87
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:27,116
You came to my club flashing money...

88
00:11:27,286 --> 00:11:30,187
...and then you interrupt
my guys at the bank.

89
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:33,357
I take it that was not a coincidence.

90
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:36,818
Those clowns? They work for you?

91
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:41,828
You've made
quite a reputation for yourself.

92
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:44,902
I set up this test
so I could see with my own eyes...

93
00:11:45,071 --> 00:11:46,800
...if you were man or myth.

94
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:48,269
And clearly...

95
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,965
...you're both.

96
00:11:50,142 --> 00:11:52,406
Well, I'm glad I could
clear it up for you...

97
00:11:52,578 --> 00:11:54,478
...Mr. Edge.

98
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,647
I'd like to talk about
a job opportunity.

99
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,017
Thanks, but I'm really not looking
for work right now.

100
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:08,023
I like to fly solo.

101
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:13,063
No matter how many bullets bounce
off you, Kal, you're still a kid...

102
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,998
...and I'm the biggest
crime boss of Metropolis.

103
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:21,204
Well, I would think
you could afford better help.

104
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:25,700
That's why we're talking.

105
00:12:26,946 --> 00:12:29,506
I've got this one job.

106
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:31,149
It'll make you Midas rich.

107
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:39,214
So when you are tired
of playing in the little league...

108
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,120
...you know where to find me.

109
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,934
Mr. Luthor?

110
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,340
Mr. Luthor.

111
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:07,342
Mr. Luthor.

112
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,885
I got your message.

113
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:12,888
I was surprised you wanted to meet
today, considering tomorrow is Lex's--

114
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,357
My son is gone, Miss Sullivan,
and there is nothing I can do now...

115
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:20,397
...but put his memory to rest
and get on with the business of living.

116
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:26,132
You remember there used to be
an octagonal keyhole here.

117
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,933
Vaguely. I didn't spend
much time in this cave.

118
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:34,102
Trust me, it was right here.
It disappeared the same day as that...

119
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,149
...inexplicable explosion
on the Kent farm.

120
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:43,084
The same day
that our young friend Clark...

121
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,689
...went into exile.

122
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:48,917
You haven't seen him...

123
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,593
-...have you?
-After the fight that Clark and I had...

124
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:55,199
...I'd be the last person he'd call.

125
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:02,098
I've enjoyed reading
your column, Miss Sullivan.

126
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,832
You're a good writer.

127
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:10,244
"The worst sin of age
is to forget the trials of youth."

128
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,981
I just wish that report you did for me on
Clark Kent had the same kind of insight.

129
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:17,486
I gave you everything I had.

130
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:20,921
But you came to me with such vigor,
and now it seems your enthusiasm...

131
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:23,926
...for our arrangement is waning.

132
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:27,755
It's kind of hard to find information
when the subject is MlA.

133
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:33,200
It might help you to view that
as a test of your reporter's mettle.

134
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,203
You're such a promising young talent.

135
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,638
I'd hate to see an opportunity
like this vanish...

136
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:41,644
...Iike the keyhole on this wall here.

137
00:14:42,781 --> 00:14:46,615
Threatening me, Mr. Luthor, isn't going
to make Clark magically reappear.

138
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,814
"All decisions have consequences."

139
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,487
Clark chose to run away from his.

140
00:14:53,659 --> 00:14:57,288
You going to run away
from yours, too, Miss Sullivan?

141
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,359
Whoa, easy there, Lex.

142
00:15:33,532 --> 00:15:34,863
Where am l?

143
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:37,502
Same place you've been
the last three months.

144
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,035
Paradise.

145
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,338
You had another fever dream.

146
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,943
Malaria's still got you.

147
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:51,039
You were calling her name again.

148
00:15:52,551 --> 00:15:54,041
Who?

149
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,252
That bitch who set you up.

150
00:16:01,093 --> 00:16:02,560
Louis...

151
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:05,720
...I appreciate everything
you've done for me...

152
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,799
...but if you ever refer to my wife
that way again...

153
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,198
...I won't be held responsible
for my actions.

154
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:16,638
See, I was just sitting here running
through your story in my head.

155
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,802
Now, you wake up. Helen and the pilot
are gone, and you're left to die.

156
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:23,178
You've got to consider the possibility.

157
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,340
Do you have anything else
to talk about?

158
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:29,112
All these years alone on an island?
Not really.

159
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:30,980
Why don't you go work on the raft?

160
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,216
Because I am not going to let you
commit suicide.

161
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:37,294
You could drift for weeks and die alone.
Is that what you want?

162
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,556
I want to get off this island...

163
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,700
...and find out the truth.

164
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,630
Oh, the truth.

165
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:47,697
See, the way I figure it,
either your father set you both up...

166
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:51,707
...Helen managed this on her own,
or the two of them were in league.

167
00:16:51,877 --> 00:16:55,472
Why are you in such a hurry
to get back to a family that twisted?

168
00:16:56,415 --> 00:17:00,476
-Because my life is not here.
-lt doesn't sound so great back there.

169
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,953
You've got to stop looking
at this place as a curse.

170
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:05,954
-Shut up!
-lt is a gift!

171
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,959
Your life has been stripped down
to its bare essence.

172
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,861
To the outside world,
you're already dead.

173
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,695
Why not let your old self rest in peace?

174
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:26,473
I think the cruelest fate
that a parent can suffer...

175
00:17:27,446 --> 00:17:28,811
...is to lose a child.

176
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,173
Lex was touched with greatness.

177
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:37,521
We'd only just begun
to see that potential.

178
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:41,750
I can only imagine the heights
he would've soared to if his life...

179
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:45,223
...hadn't been...

180
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,762
...cut short so tragically.

181
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:56,101
These rituals are meant
to bring closure...

182
00:17:56,275 --> 00:18:00,041
...but there are so many unanswered
questions about Lex's disappearance...

183
00:18:00,212 --> 00:18:03,704
...questions I hope
that will someday be answered.

184
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,078
But those answers
won't bring him back.

185
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:11,083
I would've searched for a thousand years
if I thought he could be found.

186
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:13,224
We can't hold on to the past.

187
00:18:15,127 --> 00:18:19,291
In my heart, I will be searching
for my son forever.

188
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,057
So will l.

189
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:36,706
If you're here
to grandstand for the paparazzi...

190
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:38,349
...I will have you escorted out.

191
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,484
I wish to pay my last respects
to my husband.

192
00:18:41,653 --> 00:18:46,113
Then, Mrs. Luthor, allow me to leave
before the hypocrisy begins.

193
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:06,738
Clark, I need to talk to you about--

194
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:09,472
Chloe, I told you
to never come back here again.

195
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:13,774
-Who else knows I'm here?
-No one. Your secret's safe with me...

196
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,510
...but we need to talk.

197
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:17,720
I'm busy.

198
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,290
Well, I'm coming in.
Now, what's your deal?

199
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,121
You come to Metropolis,
and you're completely different.

200
00:19:23,295 --> 00:19:25,229
Maybe it's the real me.

201
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:29,891
Well, if it is, then I definitely
prefer the country Clark. Now....

202
00:19:30,068 --> 00:19:32,536
How did you afford all of this?

203
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:37,207
Why, Chloe? So you can put me in your
column or write a big story about me?

204
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:41,369
-Maybe that's why you kept my secret.
-I kept your secret because you asked me to.

205
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:44,539
I was hoping you'd get a grip
and come home.

206
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:47,310
Some people in Smallville
haven't given up on the search.

207
00:19:47,486 --> 00:19:49,511
I've erased Smallville from my past.

208
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,714
Really? Is that why
you're still wearing your school ring?

209
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:57,225
Sooner or later someone else
is gonna find you.

210
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,795
-You were lucky.
-Maybe so.

211
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,559
But what are you gonna do if Lana
shows up on your doorstep? Or your dad?

212
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:06,135
-How will you explain this to them?
-I'm done explaining myself to anyone.

213
00:20:06,305 --> 00:20:09,968
Clark, Lana is a wreck,
and your parents are losing the farm!

214
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:12,303
What do I care?
I'm never gonna go back, anyway.

215
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,536
Clark, you were not forced into exile.

216
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,649
You ran away from your problems. You are
not being noble. You're being a coward!

217
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,282
Chloe, get out.

218
00:20:21,453 --> 00:20:25,549
You tell anyone where I am, I'll go so far
away that no one will ever find me!

219
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,789
I don't even know who you are anymore.

220
00:20:28,527 --> 00:20:29,721
Get out!

221
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:11,966
The highlight of the somber affair was
the performance of the grieving widow...

222
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:14,503
...played to perfection
by Dr. Helen Bryce...

223
00:21:14,673 --> 00:21:19,269
...in her first public appearance
since her dramatic rescue.

224
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:22,310
I want you out of my house.

225
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:25,944
You can drop the act, Helen.
You're among family.

226
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:28,279
And it's not your house. Yet.

227
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,921
I'm sure you didn't come here
for a condolence call.

228
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,149
-I won't give condolences to a murderer.
-I didn't murder Lex.

229
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:35,725
Oh, that's right.

230
00:21:35,894 --> 00:21:41,127
Let me see if I can remember
your account of the harrowing event.

231
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,200
You woke up having been robbed...

232
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:47,737
...found the pilot jumping out of the
airplane with only one parachute left...

233
00:21:47,906 --> 00:21:52,206
...Lex valiantly offered to give it to you
and went down to his death...

234
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:53,969
...in the crippled aircraft.

235
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,046
That's a wonderful piece of fiction.

236
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:02,681
I think the police would find it interesting
that you hired me to spy on Lex.

237
00:22:02,854 --> 00:22:04,253
You murdered my son.

238
00:22:04,423 --> 00:22:07,358
I won't rest until I've brought
your duplicity to light.

239
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:15,929
You know, Helen, black widows
may be powerful predators...

240
00:22:16,101 --> 00:22:17,830
...but every predator is...

241
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:22,568
...somebody else's prey.

242
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,000
Louis!

243
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,067
Louis!

244
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:59,403
Louis! Louis!

245
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:02,308
There's a plane! Did you hear it?

246
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:04,540
-I heard it.
-What's your problem?

247
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:07,116
That's the first one
that's flown over in months!

248
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,753
It's too late now. It's long gone.

249
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:14,952
That's great! That's just great!

250
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:17,357
You're wasting your time.
They'll never see it.

251
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,464
Son of a bitch.
I need to get off this island!

252
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:25,596
You know in your heart
this is where you belong.

253
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,730
Now, you can rage against it,
but ultimately you'll have to accept it.

254
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,474
You stay away from me, you freak.

255
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:03,701
I spoke to the bank.
They still want us out before the auction.

256
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:09,313
You know, it's amazing how you can fit your
whole life into the back of a pickup truck.

257
00:24:11,917 --> 00:24:15,546
Is Bill Ross still okay with us
storing our stuff in his garage?

258
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,985
Yeah. He said as long as we need it,
it's fine with him.

259
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,718
Oh, Lana gave me the keys
to the apartment over the Talon.

260
00:24:22,894 --> 00:24:25,761
-Great.
-Yeah, it's-- It's small.

261
00:24:25,931 --> 00:24:27,455
Yeah.

262
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,032
It's okay. Martha, Martha.

263
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,537
It's just not fair.

264
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:43,079
This farm has been in your family
for three generations. Four, counting Clark.

265
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,311
It's sad.

266
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,114
Since when have our lives
been fair anyway, huh?

267
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,724
Do you remember the day...

268
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:56,827
...we found out
we couldn't have children?

269
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:02,893
You grabbed my hand,
and you told me not to worry.

270
00:25:04,102 --> 00:25:07,469
You said that we would have
happy days again.

271
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:11,468
And you were right.
We have had happy days.

272
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:13,508
With Clark.

273
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,041
But even though
he's not here with us anymore...

274
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:21,015
...Martha Kent, I am here to tell you
that we will have happy days again.

275
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:34,656
Clark!

276
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,299
Clark! Clark!

277
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,567
Clark.

278
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:49,805
Clark!

279
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,146
Clark.

280
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,763
Thank you.
Lana, hey, the other day, l....

281
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:10,493
I didn't mean to push my own
personal brand of self-denial on you.

282
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:14,500
It's okay, Chloe. We're all dealing
with Clark in our own way.

283
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:19,372
Yeah. And my way is to pull the emotional
ripcord and pretend like it didn't happen.

284
00:26:19,544 --> 00:26:22,274
It's a force of habit
when people walk out of my life.

285
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,609
I can't give up on him without a fight.

286
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:28,013
I already blew it once.

287
00:26:29,287 --> 00:26:30,777
Blew it? How?

288
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:35,217
When Clark was leaving,
he asked me to go with him.

289
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:38,089
I said no, but I can't help thinking
that if I had gone...

290
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,254
...I could've convinced him
to come home.

291
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,533
Lana, you can't save someone
who doesn't want to be saved.

292
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,038
I love him.

293
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,339
It's okay.

294
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:57,345
Your feelings for Clark
aren't exactly breaking news.

295
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:03,978
I saw him yesterday.

296
00:27:04,155 --> 00:27:06,623
-Just for a second, at Lex's funeral.
-Are you sure?

297
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,548
Positive.

298
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:11,855
But he took off right away.
I'm gonna go back up there...

299
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,964
...and post these.

300
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:17,930
Could you give me a lift?

301
00:27:18,103 --> 00:27:20,936
Sure, but you don't need the fliers.

302
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,734
-I know where he is.
-What?

303
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:28,105
Yeah. Okay, you're going to totally hate me
for this, but I found him two months ago.

304
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,840
Some of my friends from the Planet
snuck me into a club, and there he was.

305
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:35,180
I couldn't believe it, so I followed
him back to his apartment.

306
00:27:35,353 --> 00:27:38,720
You've known where he's been, and
you haven't said anything to anybody?

307
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:42,417
He said if anyone found out, he'd run
away to somewhere nobody'd find him.

308
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,030
-I can't believe you've told me to give up.
-He's not acting like himself.

309
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:48,222
-He could be dangerous.
-Give me the address.

310
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,892
-Well, I'll take you.
-No, I think you've done enough already.

311
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:09,446
What are you doing here?

312
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,549
Looking for you.

313
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:17,192
-Clark, you need to come home.
-Smallville's not my home anymore.

314
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:26,968
I am not letting you
ride out of my life again.

315
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,974
Then get on.

316
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,812
Lex, I'd like you to meet my dad.

317
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:50,315
You killed your father.

318
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,814
Yeah, it was inevitable.

319
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,357
I had to do it.
Only one of us could survive.

320
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,861
See, back there,
he was a rich and powerful guy.

321
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:06,701
He was always criticizing me...

322
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,997
...never thinking I was good enough.

323
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,809
It just kept chipping away.

324
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,673
Chipping away.

325
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:17,838
Until there was nothing left.

326
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,689
I thought you and I were kindred spirits.

327
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,530
No, Louis...

328
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:38,725
...you're a psychopath.

329
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,973
Well, there's one in all of us.

330
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,776
I just let mine out.

331
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,440
Lex!

332
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:20,404
Hey, what's up, Kal?

333
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,907
Why'd she call you "Kal"?

334
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,276
It's my secret identity.

335
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:29,181
Clark. Clark! I have been worried
about you for three months...

336
00:31:29,354 --> 00:31:31,652
...and you've been
hanging around in nightclubs?

337
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,155
You're so cute when you're angry.

338
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:40,727
Lana, if you keep talking about Hicksville,
you're gonna be on the next bus going back.

339
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,594
I thought you were here to have fun.

340
00:31:42,767 --> 00:31:45,258
-What's up, Kal?
-Hey, what's up?

341
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:48,701
You're right, I'm sorry.
I'll go freshen up.

342
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:50,500
Hey, why?

343
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,972
I think you look great.

344
00:32:03,855 --> 00:32:05,186
I'm glad you're here.

345
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,756
Me too.

346
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,368
Well, if she is the one
you've been saving yourself for...

347
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,094
...I can understand the wait.

348
00:32:24,809 --> 00:32:27,175
-Hello.
-Mr. Kent, I found Clark.

349
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,710
Lana, where are you?

350
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,907
Nightclub in Metropolis called Atlantis.
He's acting really strange.

351
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,985
Lana, listen to me.
Clark is not himself right now.

352
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,519
I want you to be very careful.

353
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,658
I'm on my way, but if he wants
to leave, don't try and stop him.

354
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,190
Okay.

355
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,658
Who you talking to?

356
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,688
-Who's this?
-Oh, Clark.

357
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:48,889
Clark, it's me.

358
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:51,993
Jonathan.

359
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,663
How's the farm?

360
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:56,065
Clark.

361
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,471
Your mother and I love you very much,
and we want you to come home.

362
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,906
Is that right?

363
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,243
Hey, what about not dwelling on the past
and making a fresh new start?

364
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,351
Come on, you can admit it.
You're happier I'm gone.

365
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,510
-Clark....
-Son, that's not true.

366
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,883
I'm not your son,
and you're not my parents.

367
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:15,525
You never have been.
You never will be!

368
00:33:19,230 --> 00:33:21,892
Clark, what is the matter with you?
Your parents love you.

369
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:27,832
-I love you.
-Do you always betray people you love?

370
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:35,412
I've gotta go get him.

371
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,979
How, Jonathan?

372
00:33:37,148 --> 00:33:40,311
He could either run, or if he's
angry enough, he could hurt you.

373
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,945
-You can't stop him.
-Martha, if I don't go and get him now...

374
00:33:45,123 --> 00:33:47,489
...we may lose him forever.

375
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:18,646
I'm glad you decided
to consider my offer.

376
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,291
But why the change of heart?

377
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,755
My past is catching up to my present.

378
00:34:27,932 --> 00:34:29,763
I need to disappear.

379
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,333
Free tonight?

380
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:39,407
My calendar just opened up.

381
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:42,609
This is an account in Grand Cayman.

382
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,947
Here's how much is waiting for you.

383
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:52,781
That's a serious amount of zeros.

384
00:34:54,258 --> 00:34:56,055
It's a serious job.

385
00:34:56,861 --> 00:34:59,386
I need you to break into a secure building.

386
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:04,026
The office on the 60th floor
has a very valuable package.

387
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:08,199
It's in a titanium-reinforced steel safe.

388
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,574
Not a job for mere mortals.

389
00:35:13,744 --> 00:35:15,405
Sounds like easy money.

390
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,808
I haven't told you
where you're going yet.

391
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,620
LuthorCorp Plaza.

392
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,853
You want me to break into
Lionel Luthor's office.

393
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:32,427
Will that be a problem?

394
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,560
No.

395
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,668
It'll be my pleasure.

396
00:35:39,604 --> 00:35:41,538
Lex.

397
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,231
Lex.

398
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,469
Lex.

399
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,046
Lex!

400
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:54,677
I know every inch of this island.

401
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,612
Where are you going?

402
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,104
You can't kill me.

403
00:36:21,379 --> 00:36:22,869
Hey, man.

404
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,583
What happening?

405
00:36:28,786 --> 00:36:30,811
No, no.

406
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,922
I had to do it.

407
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,455
He was crazy.

408
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,718
I had no choice. I had to kill him.

409
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,854
Kill who?

410
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:42,997
Him!

411
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,733
There ain't nobody there, man.

412
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,810
No. No!

413
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,415
Louis!

414
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:03,142
These islands can mess with your head,
play tricks, man.

415
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:06,855
You're lucky my captain saw your fire.

416
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:12,853
It wasn't a trick. He was real.

417
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,964
You have to believe me.

418
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:16,929
He was real!

419
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,106
He wasn't ready!

420
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,215
But you had to keep pushing
him anyway, didn't you?

421
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:10,147
What kind of a race are you people? !

422
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,093
No wonder you destroyed yourselves.

423
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,965
I am Jor-El.

424
00:39:05,476 --> 00:39:07,535
The true father of Kal-El.

425
00:39:08,612 --> 00:39:10,978
His name is Clark Kent.

426
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:14,174
I am his father. I raised him.

427
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,879
You have fulfilled
your function in Kal-El's destiny.

428
00:39:18,055 --> 00:39:20,649
His destiny is whatever he makes of it.

429
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,885
His destiny is too great
for you to comprehend.

430
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:29,590
This was Kal-El's first test to see
if he was ready to begin his journey.

431
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,701
He's too young.
He needs more time.

432
00:39:33,471 --> 00:39:36,929
This phase of Kal-El's journey
is almost complete.

433
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:40,839
It will be of no consequence
if he returns to you, for now.

434
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:45,509
You'll bring him home?

435
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:49,175
If you want him,
you must retrieve him yourself.

436
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,046
I can ' t. He' s too powerful.

437
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:56,091
Are you willing to sacrifice
anything to get him back?

438
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,522
Yes.

439
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:00,722
For my son, I'll do anything.

440
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54,242
Hello, Clark.

441
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:00,280
Jonathan Kent.

442
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:03,220
Isn't it a little past your bedtime?

443
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,488
How'd you find me?

444
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,399
Your biological father.

445
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,837
You two are working together now, huh?

446
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,036
That's cute.

447
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,942
But I didn't listen to him, and I'm
certainly not gonna listen to you.

448
00:41:24,114 --> 00:41:25,479
Clark...

449
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,979
...you need to put all this
behind you, son.

450
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,984
Come on home to the people
who love you.

451
00:41:40,431 --> 00:41:43,298
You should've stayed in Smallville.

452
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,146
Son...

453
00:41:57,314 --> 00:41:59,214
...you're coming home with me.

454
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,117
Now.

455
00:43:05,148 --> 00:43:07,139
Previously on Smallville¡G

456
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:08,579
Smallville's not my home anymore.

457
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,585
The longer he's on the red kryptonite,
the worse he gets.

458
00:43:11,755 --> 00:43:14,690
-You've known where he's been?
-He's not acting like himself.

459
00:43:14,858 --> 00:43:18,123
Either Helen managed this on her own,
or your father set you up.

460
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,992
Clark, what's the matter with you?
Your parents love you. I love you.

461
00:43:22,165 --> 00:43:24,429
If I don't get him now,
we may lose him forever.

462
00:43:24,601 --> 00:43:26,694
I need you to break into a secure building.

463
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:29,737
The office on the 60th floor
has a very valuable package.

464
00:43:29,906 --> 00:43:33,342
Are you willing to sacrifice
anything to get him back?

465
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,772
Yes.

466
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:36,674
Son...

467
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,246
...you're coming home with me.

468
00:43:38,415 --> 00:43:39,939
Now.

469
