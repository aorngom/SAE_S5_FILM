1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,530
Double expresso straight out.

2
00:00:11,289 --> 00:00:13,173
Okay, where's my waitress?

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:16,151
Double cap, no foam...

4
00:00:16,903 --> 00:00:18,941
skim milk, light whip, and the

5
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:21,393
double americano, old school.
Who's next?

6
00:00:21,416 --> 00:00:22,540
- Oh, yes, $6.50, thank you.
- Okay,

7
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:26,728
there's your change.

8
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:30,079
All right,

9
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:34,467
got your chocolate mint...
and yours. Thank you.

10
00:00:36,657 --> 00:00:39,293
Hi. You did not just do that.

11
00:00:42,224 --> 00:00:43,314
What can I get you?

12
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:46,404
Uh, thanks, I've already
been helped.

13
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:47,394
Great.

14
00:00:47,659 --> 00:00:48,434
Next?

15
00:00:48,551 --> 00:00:50,371
University of miami?

16
00:00:50,406 --> 00:00:51,143
Yeah.

17
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:55,934
I just don't see you trading
in your flannels for flip-flops.

18
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:59,703
Well, I figure, if you've got a chance to start over,
why not start over where there's a beach?

19
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:04,483
I am feeling a bit guilty leaving my parents
to run the farm without me.

20
00:01:04,518 --> 00:01:06,465
Yeah, I guess you would be
really hard to replace,

21
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,640
with all your skills and everything.

22
00:01:08,696 --> 00:01:09,400
Skills?

23
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:10,809
Um, lois, hey,

24
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:12,418
can I get a double cappuccino?

25
00:01:12,453 --> 00:01:13,557
Yeah, just a sec.

26
00:01:15,929 --> 00:01:16,985
Oh, my god.

27
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:18,422
We've just been robbed.

28
00:01:57,238 --> 00:01:57,907
Clark?

29
00:01:58,729 --> 00:01:59,549
Clark?

30
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:05,325
What happened?

31
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,639
Who's clark?

32
00:02:16,964 --> 00:02:22,461
Smallville - Saison 4 Episode 19

Merci à Malone

www. forom. com

36
00:03:42,198 --> 00:03:45,967
it must be kind of weird seeing the house
you grew up in for the first time.

37
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,587
Do you recognize anything?

38
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:52,475
I mean, the house or the cows...

39
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,506
the tracto, anything?

40
00:03:55,105 --> 00:03:56,514
You sure this is where I live?

41
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,584
Yeah.

42
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,823
Um, you spend most of
your time over there.

43
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,531
In a barn?

44
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:10,208
Well, normal was never really
your style, clark.

45
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,079
That was my attempt at humor.

46
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:17,462
Sometimes I crash
and burn. Sorry.

47
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:32,973
Clark.

48
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,125
It's your house.

49
00:04:37,414 --> 00:04:38,236
Right.

50
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,234
I... it was

51
00:04:50,138 --> 00:04:51,524
it was stuck.

52
00:04:52,569 --> 00:04:54,753
Actually, I think it was locked.

53
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:13,540
Mr. Kent!

54
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:15,865
Mrs. Kent!

55
00:05:18,143 --> 00:05:19,883
What the hell
happened to the door?

56
00:05:19,918 --> 00:05:20,961
You know, I tried to open it...

57
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,639
yeah, and then some freak wind came
and blew it right off.

58
00:05:25,552 --> 00:05:26,503
Right.

59
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,415
So, lois, do you know
where the kents are?

60
00:05:30,013 --> 00:05:32,667
They're in metropolis
for mr. Kent's heart exam.

61
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,499
Clark, you know that.

62
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:36,283
Well, not so much.

63
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,361
He has amnesia,
and he's havinga hard time...

64
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,136
again?

65
00:05:39,418 --> 00:05:40,721
What do you mean "again"?

66
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:46,404
Well, at least this time,
you got clothes on.

67
00:05:46,439 --> 00:05:48,494
Lois, we need to get
his parents back home.

68
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:49,790
Well, that's gonna bea little hard.

69
00:05:49,825 --> 00:05:52,655
Mr. Kent has a one-way ticket
on the ambien express.

70
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:55,062
He's gonna be out of
commission for a few days.

71
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:57,457
So, what happened?

72
00:05:58,538 --> 00:06:01,788
Well, the last thing I remember,
I woke up in the alley. I was with...

73
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:02,610
chloe.

74
00:06:02,774 --> 00:06:06,649
I'm thinking he caught up to whoever
was behind the "robbery in plain sight" incident.

75
00:06:07,001 --> 00:06:09,889
And, what, we have a thief
with memory repo?

76
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:15,323
I guess that could explain why,
in some weird smallville an way,

77
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:18,329
I zoned on eight coffee orders
before I found the till was empty.

78
00:06:18,364 --> 00:06:20,642
I'm gonna go to the torch and see
what I can find out about amnesia.

79
00:06:20,677 --> 00:06:24,517
Yeah, just leave mr. Memory reboot to me.
I'm getting to be a pro at this.

80
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:29,567
But you know what? You're gonna have to put up with pb&j
because that's the extent of my culinary skills.

81
00:06:30,929 --> 00:06:31,833
Okay?

82
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:35,401
Uh, please tell me I'm not related to her.

83
00:06:35,483 --> 00:06:37,467
No. I am. You live with her.

84
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:38,407
Clark.

85
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:42,175
Uh...

86
00:06:43,454 --> 00:06:44,452
you know what?

87
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:48,726
I'm gonna take him up to the barn,
see if anything up there jogs his memory.

88
00:06:49,313 --> 00:06:50,758
All right, suit yourself.

89
00:06:51,463 --> 00:06:52,719
We need to talk.

90
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:03,396
What's with the cheshire cat routine?

91
00:07:04,547 --> 00:07:07,224
A little something from central kansas.

92
00:07:07,965 --> 00:07:09,116
Congratulations.

93
00:07:09,233 --> 00:07:12,376
I think if they were gonna reject you,
they probably wouldn't have sent you a novella.

94
00:07:12,423 --> 00:07:14,407
No, probably not.

95
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:17,892
Hey, I was thinking that we could go check out
the dorms on campus this weekend.

96
00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:21,473
Jason, I'm not sure that
I'm gonna go to central kansas.

97
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:24,641
I'm not even sure
if I'm gonna go to college at all.

98
00:07:26,426 --> 00:07:28,375
I've actually given this a lot of thought.

99
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,338
Which part...

100
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:32,670
the part that we've been planning
this for an entire year?

101
00:07:33,304 --> 00:07:34,846
Lana, I thought this was our one chance

102
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:38,007
to put everything that's happened
over the past couple months behind us.

103
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:40,431
It would be like paris all over again.

104
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:41,246
How?

105
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,435
Jason, last summer was incredible.

106
00:07:46,682 --> 00:07:48,514
But we have to face it.

107
00:07:48,983 --> 00:07:50,742
We haven't been able to recreate that here,

108
00:07:50,777 --> 00:07:52,808
not with everything that's happened,

109
00:07:52,891 --> 00:07:56,131
not with the stones or your mom
and all of the lies.

110
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,564
How long have you known?

111
00:07:59,172 --> 00:08:03,322
I mean, your feelings don't just change overnight,
so you've obviously been thinking about this a while.

112
00:08:03,392 --> 00:08:04,684
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

113
00:08:05,494 --> 00:08:07,772
Ever since this turned into the same relationship

114
00:08:07,795 --> 00:08:10,343
I was trying to leave
behind when I went to paris.

115
00:08:10,447 --> 00:08:11,738
Oh, so this is about clark.

116
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:14,228
No, it's not about clark.

117
00:08:14,345 --> 00:08:16,118
Jason, it's about us.

118
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:19,018
There are too many secrets.

119
00:08:20,348 --> 00:08:24,351
I kept wishing that we could wipe
the slate clean, but we can't.

120
00:08:25,901 --> 00:08:27,181
A chance like that...

121
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:31,033
maybe it only comes
around once in a lifetime.

122
00:08:42,948 --> 00:08:46,600
You were the one part of my life
that made me forget what I've turned into.

123
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:48,116
What are you talking about?

124
00:08:48,155 --> 00:08:49,598
Just don't give up on me.

125
00:08:50,085 --> 00:08:50,790
Jason...

126
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:54,312
okay? You have no idea
how much I've been protecting you.

127
00:08:55,169 --> 00:08:55,991
Do you?

128
00:09:13,477 --> 00:09:14,287
Here.

129
00:09:14,558 --> 00:09:15,673
Bend this.

130
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:20,370
This is metal. I can't bend this.

131
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,820
Just like you can't pull
a door off its hinges, right?

132
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:24,982
Try it.

133
00:09:37,931 --> 00:09:39,246
How did I do that?

134
00:09:42,945 --> 00:09:46,693
Why did I always picture myself
on the other end of this conversation?

135
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:51,378
Um, here, come here, sit.

136
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:58,073
Smallville was hit with the world's biggest
meteor shower when you were little.

137
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:01,619
Now, I know this sounds
way out there, but

138
00:10:01,912 --> 00:10:04,505
some of the meteor rockshave had an...

139
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:08,203
an extraterrestrial effect on
certain people in the town.

140
00:10:08,802 --> 00:10:11,982
And it's my theory that
you were one of them.

141
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:15,786
Extraterrestrial powers?
You mean I'm some sort of alien?

142
00:10:15,821 --> 00:10:17,535
No, of course not.

143
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,837
A mutant?

144
00:10:21,724 --> 00:10:22,594
Uh...

145
00:10:23,714 --> 00:10:24,754
yeah.

146
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:28,704
Who has saved my life
on more than one occasion.

147
00:10:29,355 --> 00:10:30,893
See, you've sort of

148
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:34,956
taken it up on yourself
to be smallville's self-appointed hero.

149
00:10:35,531 --> 00:10:37,506
And if you ask me, I...

150
00:10:37,542 --> 00:10:40,442
I think that that is... amazing.

151
00:10:55,014 --> 00:10:58,082
We must've been pretty good friends
if I trusted you with all this.

152
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,528
Yeah, well, actually...

153
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,809
you didn'T.

154
00:11:09,134 --> 00:11:11,658
It's okay. I mean, you were just
protecting yourself.

155
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:14,464
A lot of people would be
tray you if they knew.

156
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:17,994
But you wouldn't...

157
00:11:19,168 --> 00:11:20,025
would you?

158
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:24,134
Never.

159
00:11:32,228 --> 00:11:35,926
So, lois said that she was standing
right here the whole time.

160
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:38,860
I don't know why we just
don't call the police.

161
00:11:39,552 --> 00:11:43,075
The same reason why I didn't just
take you to the hospital. Clark...

162
00:11:43,134 --> 00:11:46,905
...the last thing we want is to get you on the radar
of smallville's friendliest authorities.

163
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:50,357
Now, can you see if you can find anything?

164
00:11:59,868 --> 00:12:00,760
Chloe.

165
00:12:01,406 --> 00:12:03,214
Is there something there?

166
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,772
Back behind the... near your feet.
Under the mat.

167
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:09,740
Okay, how'd you know that was there?

168
00:12:10,503 --> 00:12:11,818
Well, I... I could...

169
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:13,626
I guess...

170
00:12:14,119 --> 00:12:16,010
I... I can see through things.

171
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:21,366
Hold on a minute, are you telling me that
you can see through solid objects?

172
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:26,037
I guess that's one you didn't know about, huh?

173
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:27,763
No, uh,

174
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,859
and, uh, that might be one of those abilities
you're gonna want to keep a lid on.

175
00:12:32,893 --> 00:12:34,654
You know, I've been thinking about that.

176
00:12:34,924 --> 00:12:35,640
You know,

177
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,517
I don't know why I was worried
so much about what people think.

178
00:12:39,564 --> 00:12:42,206
I don't know why I let it ruin my life.
I mean, you understood.

179
00:12:42,241 --> 00:12:44,963
Yeah, but, clark, unfortunately,

180
00:12:44,986 --> 00:12:48,617
some people in smallville aren't as progressive...
as your post-amnesia tour guide.

181
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:50,552
That should be their problem, not mine.

182
00:12:50,576 --> 00:12:55,857
Look, I understand how eager you are
to throw an impromptu coming-out party.

183
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:59,600
I mean, I've only spent the last couple of hours
blocking for the man behind the mask,

184
00:12:59,635 --> 00:13:01,913
and it's not as easy as I thought it would be.

185
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,956
But, please, just sleep on it.

186
00:13:04,003 --> 00:13:05,339
I know. It's just...

187
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,155
I mean, how can anyone ever get
to know me if I'm never myself?

188
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,963
I know it's hard,

189
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,998
but I imagine that if you didn't tell people,
you must've had a lifetime of reasons for not doing it.

190
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,838
So that's why we need
to get your memory back.

191
00:13:20,117 --> 00:13:21,374
So I can do what...

192
00:13:21,421 --> 00:13:22,667
get back to lying to everyone?

193
00:13:22,702 --> 00:13:23,277
Clark...

194
00:13:23,313 --> 00:13:24,555
chloe, I'm not sure
I want that life back.

195
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,115
At least wait until you can talk
to your parents, okay?

196
00:13:33,796 --> 00:13:34,562
Clark?

197
00:13:36,007 --> 00:13:36,864
Clark?

198
00:13:57,284 --> 00:14:00,677
Premature combustion.
That's one I didn't need to know about.

199
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:07,361
Who is that?

200
00:14:10,003 --> 00:14:10,707
T hat...

201
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:13,629
is lana lang.

202
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:22,800
The love of your life.

203
00:15:05,256 --> 00:15:07,757
looks like one more thing you don't remember.

204
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,611
You usually hide all those emotions.

205
00:15:14,843 --> 00:15:17,837
I came to ask if you were doing okay.

206
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,527
But...

207
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:22,369
it looks like I got my answer.

208
00:15:22,968 --> 00:15:25,511
My life is a complete void.
How would you feel?

209
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:28,794
Oh, pity party... these are fun.

210
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,528
Look, chloe's very protective of me.

211
00:15:33,955 --> 00:15:36,256
I guess there's a lot
of people that I can't trust.

212
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:38,699
And you can't tell who they are.

213
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:43,783
Look, you may not remember
all the players on the board,

214
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,154
but you can still play the game.

215
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:49,641
Are you gonna tell me
how I'm supposed to do that?

216
00:15:50,357 --> 00:15:51,614
Trust your gut.

217
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,386
Like, what's it say about me?

218
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,552
We don't like each other very much.

219
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:06,051
You're on the right track.

220
00:16:06,828 --> 00:16:08,037
Keep it up, smallville.

221
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:48,603
hi, clark.

222
00:16:50,165 --> 00:16:50,928
Hi.

223
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:53,335
I heard about what happened to you.

224
00:16:55,202 --> 00:16:58,520
Oh, I'm sorry. I suppose you
don't even know who I am.

225
00:16:58,555 --> 00:16:59,506
Lana.

226
00:17:07,655 --> 00:17:09,790
I was gonna come by later.

227
00:17:09,826 --> 00:17:11,916
I didn't think I'd see you here.

228
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,358
I actually came here to see you.

229
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:19,718
Chloe... she...

230
00:17:21,104 --> 00:17:23,276
she told me that we used to, uh...

231
00:17:23,299 --> 00:17:24,192
Yeah,

232
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:25,812
Yeah, we did.

233
00:17:28,783 --> 00:17:29,924
What happened?

234
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,935
Please, I just...

235
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,394
I'd really like to know.

236
00:17:40,216 --> 00:17:41,519
So would I.

237
00:17:44,971 --> 00:17:46,134
It was me?

238
00:17:56,277 --> 00:17:57,721
I don't understand.

239
00:17:59,764 --> 00:18:02,897
If I felt anywhere near like I feel now...

240
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,314
you know, don't tell me.

241
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:08,685
I don't want to know.

242
00:18:09,613 --> 00:18:11,729
I don't want to know,
because this time,

243
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:14,147
it'll be different.

244
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,278
This time?

245
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:22,978
Um...

246
00:18:24,998 --> 00:18:27,522
I don't think we should talk
about this right now.

247
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,863
When can we talk about this?

248
00:18:39,781 --> 00:18:41,155
How did he get here?

249
00:18:43,786 --> 00:18:46,311
Looks like the heart remembers
more than the brain.

250
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:50,680
Com'on, cuz,

251
00:18:50,715 --> 00:18:54,554
don't give one more second of thought
to those vacant baby blues.

252
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:56,421
Hey,

253
00:18:56,653 --> 00:18:57,569
good news. Uh,

254
00:18:57,616 --> 00:19:01,033
we traced that day pass we found...
to grand view motocross park.

255
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:03,017
It belongs to a guy
named kevin grady.

256
00:19:03,417 --> 00:19:06,738
He lives in smallville, so we thought
we'd go check out the address.

257
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:07,900
Coming?

258
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,626
Kevin?

259
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:30,137
What are you doing here?

260
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:32,508
Look, I'm sorry, dad,
but i couldn't stay there any longer.

261
00:19:32,532 --> 00:19:35,113
Kev, you have to go back.
You're in the middle of your treatment

262
00:19:35,136 --> 00:19:36,428
It's not working.

263
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:39,575
Look, I know you want to keep
what I did to dylan a secret,

264
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,640
but no matter what they do
to try to make me forget it,

265
00:19:43,109 --> 00:19:44,518
I'll always know the truth.

266
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:45,117
Kev...

267
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:46,303
don't worry about me,

268
00:19:46,326 --> 00:19:48,510
okay? I've got money together.
I'll be fine.

269
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:53,016
After what I did, I can't expect you
to look at me every day.

270
00:19:54,449 --> 00:19:55,964
Kevin, please let us help you.

271
00:19:55,999 --> 00:19:57,379
You can'T.

272
00:19:58,359 --> 00:20:00,993
That place turned me into
some kind of freak.

273
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:02,893
What do you mean?

274
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:04,734
This.

275
00:20:16,867 --> 00:20:17,760
Yes?

276
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:19,051
Hi.

277
00:20:19,227 --> 00:20:21,717
I'm here to collect on a little
spontaneous line of credit

278
00:20:21,752 --> 00:20:23,570
your son decided to take out
with the talon,

279
00:20:23,605 --> 00:20:25,413
along with two minutes
of my memory.

280
00:20:25,437 --> 00:20:27,139
Uh, you must be mistaken.

281
00:20:27,163 --> 00:20:29,558
Well, actually, mr. Grady,
we found this

282
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:31,824
by the register at the talon.
It's kevin's.

283
00:20:31,847 --> 00:20:33,201
We just want to talk to him.

284
00:20:34,235 --> 00:20:36,736
I'm afraid that's not possible.
My son is out of town at the moment.

285
00:20:36,771 --> 00:20:38,741
And by "out of town",
I'm guessing you're meaning

286
00:20:38,776 --> 00:20:41,724
undergoing some kind of treatment
at summerholt institute.

287
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:47,282
I'm sorry, I couldn't help but notice
the parking pass on your windshield.

288
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,306
I believe that's nobody's
business but ours. Excuse me.

289
00:20:53,329 --> 00:20:54,809
Look, we're not saying he did it.

290
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:57,110
We just need to find out what he knows.

291
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:08,992
All right.

292
00:21:10,731 --> 00:21:13,913
Yes, my son is a patient at summerholt.

293
00:21:14,817 --> 00:21:17,318
Last fall, I took both my boys hunting

294
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,478
at audrey clearing.

295
00:21:20,476 --> 00:21:21,815
There was an accident.

296
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:25,607
Kevin was loading his gun, and, uh...

297
00:21:28,285 --> 00:21:29,893
I lost my son dylan.

298
00:21:35,012 --> 00:21:36,527
Mr. Grady, I'm sorry.

299
00:21:38,735 --> 00:21:41,216
Kevin couldn't live with himself.
He was, uh...

300
00:21:42,907 --> 00:21:44,950
and I didn't know which way to turn,

301
00:21:45,408 --> 00:21:46,277
so I...

302
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:50,031
well, we thought that if summerholt

303
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,505
could help erase those memories, well, then

304
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,759
maybe kevin could get on with his life.

305
00:21:57,935 --> 00:21:59,239
Excuse me, uh,

306
00:21:59,426 --> 00:22:01,106
I need to try and find my son.

307
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:01,892
Thank you.

308
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:10,682
Look, it tugs at the heartstrings, but

309
00:22:10,717 --> 00:22:12,431
I'm not sure I totally buy it.

310
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:14,193
I'm gonna go have a look around.

311
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:23,726
Clark, are you okay?

312
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:26,262
I can hear someone running.

313
00:22:26,884 --> 00:22:27,554
What?

314
00:22:27,636 --> 00:22:30,428
And the super wheaties abilities
just keep coming.

315
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:31,532
Where are they?

316
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:33,035
They're on the side of the house.

317
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,033
Well, go get them.

318
00:22:34,068 --> 00:22:36,229
It sounds like he'son a motorcycle now.

319
00:22:37,309 --> 00:22:38,666
Trust me on this one, clark. Run.

320
00:22:38,701 --> 00:22:40,450
- Chloe...
- Just run, clark!

321
00:23:10,502 --> 00:23:13,426
I guess the whole castle thing
didn't take off in the neighborhood?

322
00:23:13,848 --> 00:23:15,750
I can't believe I'm friendswith a billionaire.

323
00:23:15,786 --> 00:23:18,439
Funny. You never seemed
that impressed before.

324
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:22,929
Mr. Luthor.

325
00:23:25,289 --> 00:23:26,299
Lex.

326
00:23:26,768 --> 00:23:31,042
I'm guessing you don't remember it, but we kind of
dropped the formalities the day I ran you off a bridge.

327
00:23:31,295 --> 00:23:34,113
Look, as much as I'm sure we're all
enjoying this little icebreaker,

328
00:23:34,149 --> 00:23:35,875
we did come here for a reason.

329
00:23:35,898 --> 00:23:38,822
I was hoping that you still had your contact
at the summerholt institute.

330
00:23:38,857 --> 00:23:41,382
Chloe mentioned that they had done
some experiments on you.

331
00:23:41,558 --> 00:23:43,709
Yeah, we were guessing that
the guy that did this to clark

332
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:46,933
is undergoing some sort of treatment
to have his memory wiped.

333
00:23:47,755 --> 00:23:51,489
Probably not too far of a leap, given
their unnerving advancements in the field.

334
00:23:51,712 --> 00:23:54,584
Look, I'll make a few calls,
see what I can find.

335
00:23:55,229 --> 00:23:57,202
Chloe, if you don't mind, uh,

336
00:23:57,249 --> 00:23:58,905
I'd like to have a word with clark.

337
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:02,732
Well, I promised his parents
that I would get him home.

338
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:05,044
Well, I think I can manage that.

339
00:24:06,524 --> 00:24:08,931
It's all right, chloe. You could use
a break from chaperone duty.

340
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:10,067
I'll be okay.

341
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:13,014
Okay.

342
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:21,538
Clark...

343
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:23,229
be careful.

344
00:24:29,523 --> 00:24:32,662
Clark, I think I might know something
that could jog your memory.

345
00:24:38,615 --> 00:24:40,306
I found these caves?

346
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:43,244
And ever since, the two of us
have been working together

347
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,299
trying to solve its mysteries.

348
00:24:45,816 --> 00:24:47,682
But that's just between you and me.

349
00:24:49,831 --> 00:24:51,405
What do all these symbols mean?

350
00:24:52,413 --> 00:24:55,853
I know it'll probably sound strange,
but we think they're about you.

351
00:24:58,918 --> 00:24:59,775
Wait.

352
00:25:00,738 --> 00:25:03,181
There should be a two-headed
monster over here.

353
00:25:06,023 --> 00:25:07,972
Then you remember this place.

354
00:25:08,077 --> 00:25:10,684
No, I recognize it
from the drawings in the loft.

355
00:25:12,997 --> 00:25:15,160
We were, uh, documenting them.

356
00:25:16,475 --> 00:25:17,250
Wait.

357
00:25:18,647 --> 00:25:20,585
This wall shouldn't be here.

358
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,604
What do you mean?

359
00:25:22,733 --> 00:25:25,945
Well, in the drawings,
it shows a room behind this wall.

360
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,839
Clark, maybe we should head back to the loft
and take a closer look at the pictures.

361
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,589
I could help explain them to you.

362
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:41,196
No, I should probably get back.
I don't want my parents to worry.

363
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:43,274
Of course.

364
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:05,998
- Hello?
- Lois.

365
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,157
Hey, chloe, are you in?

366
00:27:07,214 --> 00:27:09,306
Yeah, Incoming. Check my e-mail.

367
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,484
I've got it.

368
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,245
Chloe...

369
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:18,042
lois.

370
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,756
Clark, you've got to look at this.

371
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:22,650
Chloe called and told me
to download some files

372
00:27:22,697 --> 00:27:24,282
she e-mailed from summerholt.

373
00:27:24,317 --> 00:27:25,374
How'd she get in?

374
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:29,119
I've learned never tounder estimate chloe,
especially when it comes to helping you.

375
00:27:30,446 --> 00:27:31,674
You don't have to do this.

376
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:33,553
I won't tell anyone, I promise.

377
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:35,011
I won't tell them what happend.

378
00:27:35,786 --> 00:27:37,218
I know it was an accident.

379
00:27:37,664 --> 00:27:39,195
I know you didn't mean to.

380
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,144
Kevin didn't kill his brother.

381
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:44,607
Whoever erased kevin's memories
must've planted a few new ones.

382
00:27:44,643 --> 00:27:46,333
Why would someone do that...

383
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,222
let kevin walk around thinking
he killed his own brother?

384
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:51,976
Someone who obviously
can't live with themselves.

385
00:27:52,856 --> 00:27:54,465
I need to find kevin.

386
00:27:54,864 --> 00:27:56,273
And where are you gonna find him?

387
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,927
Where his brother died.
It seems like a pretty good place to start.

388
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:01,132
Wait a minute.
Didn't his dad say

389
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,693
that the accident happened at...

390
00:28:03,503 --> 00:28:04,760
audrey clearing?

391
00:28:06,815 --> 00:28:07,801
Clark?

392
00:28:30,265 --> 00:28:31,087
Kevin.

393
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:32,449
No, it's okay.

394
00:28:32,649 --> 00:28:34,809
Listen, I came here
to talk to you about summerholt.

395
00:28:38,132 --> 00:28:39,682
You're the guy from the talon.

396
00:28:40,962 --> 00:28:42,416
How do you remember me?

397
00:28:42,885 --> 00:28:43,848
I don't.

398
00:28:44,388 --> 00:28:46,619
Whatever you did to me
erased all my memories.

399
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,005
All of them?

400
00:28:49,825 --> 00:28:52,171
Everyone else... it just wiped out
the last few minutes.

401
00:28:52,222 --> 00:28:54,073
I guess I'm not like everyone else.

402
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:58,875
Look, kevin, I know it's gonna be hard,
but I need to talk to you about the accident.

403
00:29:03,006 --> 00:29:04,521
Is this where it happened?

404
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:08,419
Somewhere here.

405
00:29:11,718 --> 00:29:14,513
I know. It was somewhere here.

406
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:17,389
Just tell me what happened that day.

407
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:34,842
Do you have any real memories
from that day?

408
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:49,871
Kevin, what is it?

409
00:29:51,925 --> 00:29:53,076
I'm not sure.

410
00:29:54,236 --> 00:29:56,384
I've been trying to block
the memories out.

411
00:29:56,748 --> 00:29:58,016
Or maybe

412
00:29:58,275 --> 00:30:00,306
someone has already blocked
them out for you.

413
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:06,983
No.

414
00:30:07,394 --> 00:30:10,201
No. I was loading my gun.
It was right here.

415
00:30:10,236 --> 00:30:11,974
But do you actually remember that?

416
00:30:12,009 --> 00:30:13,171
Do you remember loading your gun,

417
00:30:13,206 --> 00:30:14,954
or do you remember
someone telling you that?

418
00:30:39,646 --> 00:30:40,938
I didn't do it.

419
00:30:44,413 --> 00:30:45,714
It was my dad.

420
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,489
How could he do that to me?

421
00:30:55,612 --> 00:30:57,045
I'm sorry, kevin.

422
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:04,219
I don't get it.

423
00:31:05,064 --> 00:31:08,271
I robbed the talon,
and I 86'd your memory.

424
00:31:09,186 --> 00:31:11,300
I mean, why would you go
through all this trouble for me?

425
00:31:13,719 --> 00:31:15,233
I guess I just know what it's like

426
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:16,875
to lose a part of your life.

427
00:31:22,311 --> 00:31:24,377
I'm sorry, there's nothing
I can do for you.

428
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:27,486
I mean, our only chance is
to break into summerholt, but

429
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:29,611
there's no way
I can get you in there.

430
00:31:30,729 --> 00:31:31,680
Maybe I can.

431
00:31:39,093 --> 00:31:43,766
Look, this guy's kid robbed me, then plucked the last
forget-me-not petal from my friend's brain.

432
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:47,370
You will let me back there, and
you can do it with or without handcuffs.

433
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,776
Like I said, if you would sign in,
I'll let someone know that you're here.

434
00:31:51,163 --> 00:31:53,300
What part of this isn't
getting through to you?

435
00:31:53,335 --> 00:31:55,648
The last time I spoke
to my cousin, she was here.

436
00:31:55,684 --> 00:31:58,490
And I'm sure the psycho
is holding her back there somewhere.

437
00:31:59,652 --> 00:32:00,721
Ms. Lane.

438
00:32:03,224 --> 00:32:05,279
Maybe they pay you enough to be rude,

439
00:32:05,314 --> 00:32:08,379
but I doubt they pay you enough
to do time in the county jail.

440
00:32:16,354 --> 00:32:17,916
Wait. Wasn't it locked?

441
00:32:18,761 --> 00:32:20,100
I think it was broken.

442
00:32:34,965 --> 00:32:37,407
We should be able to reach
the main office from down here.

443
00:32:42,926 --> 00:32:43,771
Clark.

444
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:46,488
Clark, are you okay?

445
00:32:47,357 --> 00:32:49,048
You go ahead. I'll catch up.

446
00:33:09,804 --> 00:33:12,598
I wish I could erase your memories
from just the last three days,

447
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:14,735
but I'm afraid I can't take that chance.

448
00:33:15,029 --> 00:33:17,091
I'm gonna have to go back
much further than that.

449
00:33:17,138 --> 00:33:18,888
Mr. Grady, please don't do that.

450
00:33:18,923 --> 00:33:20,450
Think of it as a gift.

451
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:24,090
Do you realize how many experiences in life

452
00:33:24,277 --> 00:33:26,262
would be so much less painful

453
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:30,372
if we didn't have the memories to haunt us?

454
00:33:44,565 --> 00:33:47,312
Dad! What, were you just gonna lie
to me my whole life, huh?

455
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,929
To make me think I killed my own brother.

456
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:51,126
Kevin, calm down.

457
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,144
You're obviously having a psychological
reaction to your treatment.

458
00:33:56,514 --> 00:33:58,898
No one regrets what
happened more than I do.

459
00:34:56,743 --> 00:34:57,530
Chloe!

460
00:35:22,338 --> 00:35:23,570
Wow.

461
00:35:23,934 --> 00:35:25,813
Dear god in heaven.

462
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,818
Lois, sheriff.

463
00:35:44,262 --> 00:35:47,021
I guess I shouldn't
call you smallville anymore.

464
00:36:07,490 --> 00:36:09,087
Clark, what are you doing?

465
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:11,926
Are you just gonna stand there all day,
or are you gonna untie her?

466
00:36:15,155 --> 00:36:16,094
Hi.

467
00:36:16,294 --> 00:36:17,198
Thanks.

468
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:27,615
You said how'd you come across
those tapes, miss sullivan?

469
00:36:27,863 --> 00:36:29,624
Well, I was being led into the data room...

470
00:36:44,456 --> 00:36:45,407
Hey.

471
00:36:47,696 --> 00:36:49,220
You're that kid from the alley.

472
00:36:50,911 --> 00:36:52,719
I tried to pull you out of your car,

473
00:36:53,036 --> 00:36:56,112
and that's the last thing I remember
before what just happened in the lab.

474
00:36:57,169 --> 00:37:00,345
Yeah, I'm sorry about that again, clark.
That was kind of my fault.

475
00:37:01,214 --> 00:37:03,680
I don't know what you did
back there or why,

476
00:37:04,866 --> 00:37:06,333
but I get the feeling I owe you one.

477
00:37:06,427 --> 00:37:09,571
I like to see it as
a "now we're even" situation.

478
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,951
Something tells me
I shouldn't stop you from leaving.

479
00:37:13,975 --> 00:37:16,499
It's better if people don't ask
too many questions about me.

480
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,813
Thanks for the chance
at a clean slate, clark.

481
00:37:44,865 --> 00:37:45,710
Clark...

482
00:37:46,638 --> 00:37:48,246
I was just looking for you.

483
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:52,546
Congratulations.
I heard you got full retrieval.

484
00:37:53,109 --> 00:37:54,166
Everything.

485
00:37:57,465 --> 00:37:59,732
Everything except the last 24 hours.

486
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:02,092
Well, you didn't miss much, but

487
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:04,957
I wanted to come in person
to see the old clark back.

488
00:38:08,045 --> 00:38:08,820
Lex...

489
00:38:10,159 --> 00:38:13,190
chloe said she left me at the mansion
because you wanted to talk.

490
00:38:14,012 --> 00:38:15,867
What is it you wanted to talk about?

491
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:20,646
I just told you about
my own memory loss.

492
00:38:21,073 --> 00:38:22,740
I thought it might be comforting.

493
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:28,611
I'm lucky to have so many
good friends watching out for me.

494
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:32,004
Nothing you wouldn't
haved one for me, clark.

495
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:37,042
hi, I'm early, I know. I'm sorry.

496
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:43,761
I guess I'm just a little nervous.

497
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:45,499
What are you nervous about?

498
00:39:48,563 --> 00:39:50,724
Were we supposed to do something?

499
00:39:53,319 --> 00:39:56,031
Lana, I'm sorry. I don't remember
anything from the last day.

500
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:58,180
Oh.

501
00:39:59,977 --> 00:40:02,044
But everything else you remember now.

502
00:40:04,862 --> 00:40:06,083
It's probably for the best.

503
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:11,074
Were our plans,

504
00:40:11,215 --> 00:40:13,387
like, date kind of plans?

505
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:17,661
Because what about jason?

506
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:24,094
Clark, you just wanted to talk.

507
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:26,220
It's nothing that can't wait till later.

508
00:40:30,963 --> 00:40:32,197
Lana, wait.

509
00:40:35,461 --> 00:40:37,081
I can't do this.

510
00:40:39,793 --> 00:40:41,990
I can't let you walk out, not again.

511
00:40:44,855 --> 00:40:45,958
It's okay.

512
00:40:46,463 --> 00:40:48,177
We both know better than this.

513
00:40:48,224 --> 00:40:49,164
I know.

514
00:40:53,505 --> 00:40:55,666
That's why this time it'll be different.

515
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,532
This time?

516
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,112
"Summerholt memory Lane shut down. "

517
00:41:31,258 --> 00:41:32,502
Are you chloe?

518
00:41:35,896 --> 00:41:37,070
That's funny.

519
00:41:37,316 --> 00:41:39,148
It's not hilarious, but it's funny.

520
00:41:40,228 --> 00:41:43,528
My parents told me that you clark-sat
and you called them home from metropolis.

521
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:45,629
I want to say thanks.

522
00:41:46,627 --> 00:41:49,668
Well, you could still use some help
with your comedy routine,

523
00:41:49,704 --> 00:41:52,696
but it's not like I taught you
to eat solid foods again.

524
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:54,023
Still.

525
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:55,420
You're welcome.

526
00:41:58,496 --> 00:42:02,223
So it must've been kind of strange
to have a zombie best friend walking around.

527
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:07,366
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I never really realized how

528
00:42:07,563 --> 00:42:10,017
complicated that zombie's life was.

529
00:42:12,002 --> 00:42:13,211
Complicated.

530
00:42:16,088 --> 00:42:17,884
Did I do something unusual?

531
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:23,321
You had a clean slate to start all over with,

532
00:42:23,357 --> 00:42:25,599
and you made all the same choices...

533
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,220
except for one.

534
00:42:30,945 --> 00:42:33,551
Chloe, I need you to be
completely honest with me.

535
00:42:34,596 --> 00:42:35,900
Honest, huh?

536
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,393
What'd I do?

537
00:42:44,657 --> 00:42:46,218
You trusted me.

538
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:55,903
