1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,423
St. Moritz, Switzerland

2
00:02:26,503 --> 00:02:29,324
Who calls at 3 a. m.?

3
00:02:31,548 --> 00:02:34,125
- This had better be good.
- Lo, it's me.

4
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,055
Lucy?

5
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,400
Where are you?

6
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,955
Good news big sis, I'm coming to see you the Day after tomorrow,
don't worry about the airport alright, I'll grab a shuttle

7
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,311
- Lucy, wait!
- Can't wait to see you, bye!

8
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:00,912
Hope you guys are hungry because there
are plenty more where these came from.

9
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,110
Lois, you really didn't have to...
Do all this.

10
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:07,053
At least let me help.
I should make some eggs.

11
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:11,832
Oh, no no, Mrs. Kent,
you just sit down and relax.

12
00:04:11,894 --> 00:04:16,322
Look here I am using your home as my own
personal Motel 6, it's really the least I can do.

13
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,918
Yeah well I'm not that hungry,
so I'm going to have some OJ.

14
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:23,835
Come on, breakfast is the most
important meal of the day.

15
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:26,897
Bacon?

16
00:04:30,555 --> 00:04:36,644
OK so I'm never going to make it to the Cordon Bleu, but I
thought it would be less of a disaster than helping out on the farm.

17
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:40,689
Maybe ironing.

18
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:43,911
Lois what's going on?

19
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:45,810
What do you mean?

20
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:49,403
You made us breakfast,
you're offering to do chores...

21
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:51,672
you want something.

22
00:04:52,837 --> 00:04:55,106
No, it's called being nice.

23
00:04:55,663 --> 00:04:57,991
Yeah, well if you were any nicer we'd starve.

24
00:04:58,274 --> 00:04:59,509
Clark.

25
00:05:05,654 --> 00:05:07,681
He's right, Mrs. Kent.

26
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,998
Look.

27
00:05:13,826 --> 00:05:17,478
See, you guys have been
so good to me already...

28
00:05:18,983 --> 00:05:24,051
it's kind of hard to ask for
yet another favor so... but...

29
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:26,961
Lo? Anybody home?

30
00:05:28,546 --> 00:05:31,094
Oh hi sweetie, what's your name?

31
00:05:33,273 --> 00:05:36,773
- Hi!
- Oh, I'm so happy to see you!

32
00:05:38,597 --> 00:05:44,823
Um, meet my sister Lucy, she was kind of hoping
she could crash here for a couple of days.

33
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:50,940
I know it's last-minute but I had this school break...
and I'm willing to sleep in the barn.

34
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:53,259
Now that's okay, Lois can sleep in the barn.

35
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:56,742
- Nobody has to sleep out there.
- We'd love to have you Lucy.

36
00:05:57,943 --> 00:06:02,297
- You can stay in Lois's room.
- Look, we'll go up and get your things set up.

37
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:12,094
So Lucy, Lois has told us
absolutely nothing about you.

38
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:13,941
There's not much to tell.

39
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,186
Oh, please, let me gloat.

40
00:06:16,364 --> 00:06:20,121
She is getting straight A's at one of the most
prestigious prep schools in Europe,

41
00:06:20,432 --> 00:06:25,244
she is fluent in three languages, and she is
fending off Ivy League colleges with a stick.

42
00:06:25,465 --> 00:06:28,364
Wow, that's impressive.
What happened to Lois?

43
00:06:30,818 --> 00:06:35,306
You're going to find that Clark's charm is an
acquired taste, much like his sense of fashion.

44
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:43,078
Well, thanks for letting me stay,
I don't know how I'm going to repay you.

45
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:45,929
Well, just tell me plenty of
embarrassing stories about Lois.

46
00:06:46,702 --> 00:06:48,094
Funny guy.

47
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:54,201
Well, I'm just going to go wash four
time zones worth of airport connections...

48
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,917
Lucy?

49
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,989
Are you sure everything's OK?

50
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:04,051
Now that I'm here with you, it's perfect.

51
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:20,295
You know you cheated on that last stretch,
young lady. I had you beat.

52
00:07:20,902 --> 00:07:24,844
Well I only offered you a kiss,
didn't think you'd actually fall for it.

53
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:31,419
Oh my God.

54
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:35,313
Hold on.

55
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,331
Is anything missing?

56
00:07:42,304 --> 00:07:43,750
I don't know.

57
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,267
My jewelry is still here.

58
00:07:51,321 --> 00:07:52,677
My wallet is right where I left it.

59
00:07:52,892 --> 00:07:55,467
Okay well if nothing valuable
is missing then...

60
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:57,567
The stone.

61
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:16,851
Who else could have known it was here?

62
00:08:17,613 --> 00:08:20,009
- I don't know.
- Well no one saw me take it in China.

63
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:24,494
Maybe Lex or Lionel figured it out.

64
00:08:25,443 --> 00:08:26,544
Or Clark.

65
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,340
You always said there was a side
of him that you never really knew.

66
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,815
I don't care who took this Jason.

67
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:39,837
I don't care about these stones,
I just want to forget they ever existed.

68
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:43,009
Lana, this isn't some bad dream that
you can just blink away,

69
00:08:43,334 --> 00:08:45,081
This is real life.

70
00:08:46,023 --> 00:08:48,967
- We have to find that stone.
- No, we don't.

71
00:08:49,656 --> 00:08:55,558
Jason, our relationship has become more about
chasing artifacts than it is about you and me.

72
00:08:56,712 --> 00:08:59,003
And that isn't a relationship.

73
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:05,410
Remember when our biggest problem was
trying to find a place to steal a kiss?

74
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:11,494
Yeah, I usually preferred under the bleachers.

75
00:09:12,597 --> 00:09:16,041
Well there is no reason why we
can't go back to those days,

76
00:09:16,285 --> 00:09:20,760
without worrying about break-ins
and artifacts and the Luthors...

77
00:09:22,248 --> 00:09:23,939
And Clark Kent.

78
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:30,592
You're right.

79
00:09:34,644 --> 00:09:37,603
Then whoever took the stone,
they can just keep it...

80
00:09:39,743 --> 00:09:45,106
and we'll just concentrate on the
only thing that really matters...

81
00:09:45,424 --> 00:09:46,482
us.

82
00:09:58,182 --> 00:09:59,534
Hope you're thirsty.

83
00:10:00,186 --> 00:10:01,281
What are you doing?

84
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:04,170
Well I figured I'd help out
and get the morning milk.

85
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:09,216
I spent last spring break on my
friend's farm on the Swiss countryside.

86
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:11,693
Well you know you didn't really have to do that.

87
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:15,817
I figured if I'm going to stay,
I have to pull my own weight.

88
00:10:21,192 --> 00:10:23,086
Lois, did you hear that?

89
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,062
I'm sorry, did you say something?

90
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:27,614
Go get changed, I'm going to work.

91
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:29,749
Since when did you work?

92
00:10:30,293 --> 00:10:34,992
Since today. I'm helping your mom out at the Talon.
So Chloe is going to be your official Smallville tour guide,

93
00:10:35,539 --> 00:10:37,282
not that there's much to see.

94
00:10:38,951 --> 00:10:42,461
Oh I don't know, so far it looks pretty good.

95
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,050
Don't let all that flirting go to your head,
she goes to an all girls school,

96
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,902
you're probably the first guy
she's talked to in a couple of months.

97
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:57,200
Lois, I don't want you to get the wrong idea, but ever since
Lucy came to town, you've been grumpier than normal.

98
00:10:57,453 --> 00:10:59,104
Are you not happy to see your sister?

99
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:05,219
Of course I am. Look there's a thing with sisters,
you can love them without liking them.

100
00:11:05,987 --> 00:11:08,023
You don't like your own sister?

101
00:11:09,699 --> 00:11:13,190
More like she's not very crazy about me.
And not that I blame her.

102
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:19,884
Look, you might be a little rough around the edges,
but as far as sisters go... Lucy could do a lot worse.

103
00:11:21,201 --> 00:11:23,291
Thanks for the ringing endorsement.

104
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:27,481
When my mother died,

105
00:11:27,882 --> 00:11:32,010
my dad had two girls he didn't know how to deal with,
so he did what every good military leader would do,

106
00:11:32,619 --> 00:11:35,435
he instituted a chain of command.
And I reported to him...

107
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:36,776
Lucy reported to you.

108
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:41,105
Yeah. Takes sibling rivalry to a whole new level.

109
00:11:41,808 --> 00:11:46,541
I had to make sure she had three square meals,
got to school, did her homework...

110
00:11:47,656 --> 00:11:49,287
you became her mother.

111
00:11:50,607 --> 00:11:54,721
Yeah except I was not prepared.

112
00:11:54,975 --> 00:11:59,017
I used to give her advice like,
"don't kiss a boy or you're going to get pregnant"

113
00:11:59,474 --> 00:12:02,813
And yeah, they be she had a few
more chores than most kids.

114
00:12:03,513 --> 00:12:05,343
Is that why she decided to go to boarding school?

115
00:12:07,186 --> 00:12:09,735
Oh... unlike you your family,
there was no discussion.

116
00:12:09,735 --> 00:12:12,972
When the general gives an order,
you are expected to carry it out.

117
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:15,386
Sounds kind of harsh.

118
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:19,389
Trust me, Lucy got the better end of the deal.

119
00:12:19,756 --> 00:12:22,607
Don't get me wrong... she totally deserves it.

120
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:28,715
I guess there was just a part of me that was
always jealous that she got out and I didn't.

121
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:34,857
I gotta go to work.

122
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:37,196
I hear your mother's a slave driver.

123
00:12:42,123 --> 00:12:47,846
I need a half-caff soy latte, no foam, no whip,
and a blueberry muffin-top, hold the stem.

124
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:52,162
Whatever happened to regular old black coffee.

125
00:12:52,415 --> 00:12:55,307
Two Lanes under one roof,
that's gotta be interesting.

126
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:58,508
I haven't had a hot shower in 2 days,
the laundry machine is running nonstop,

127
00:12:58,842 --> 00:13:00,888
the phone line is consistently busy.

128
00:13:02,501 --> 00:13:06,446
Now it's nice having them around.
Kind of takes the loneliness out of the house.

129
00:13:06,725 --> 00:13:09,147
Yeah, I always hated the sound of a quiet home.

130
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,116
Whoa, is that Lois with a tray? Hey, cuz...

131
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:16,661
Yes it is, it's kind of like a free floor show.

132
00:13:18,971 --> 00:13:22,650
- Have you two been catching up?
- Yeah, Lucy's just filling me in on all her hidden talents.

133
00:13:23,584 --> 00:13:26,600
She was a violinist for the Zürich youth Orchestra.

134
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,323
It was nothing, it's just a hobby.

135
00:13:28,845 --> 00:13:31,466
Given their reputation in Europe,
I highly doubt that.

136
00:13:32,151 --> 00:13:34,424
- Oh sorry Lucy, this is -
- Lex Luthor.

137
00:13:34,731 --> 00:13:37,921
I read your profile in
Fortune magazine couple of months ago.

138
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:41,530
I thought your theories on the future of
American business were very interesting.

139
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,684
While I'd be curious to hear
what you think of my piano skills.

140
00:13:51,203 --> 00:13:54,211
Drop by at the mansion,
I'd love to play with a serious musician.

141
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,884
Oh, crap!

142
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:01,945
I'm gonna go help her out.

143
00:14:16,285 --> 00:14:19,649
Lucy.
Who's that guy staring at you back there?

144
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:43,338
Luthor, where is it?

145
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:47,385
Well, if perhaps you tell me what it is you want...

146
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:50,418
You know exactly what it is I want.

147
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,775
You gave me that map because
you knew I'd end up in China,

148
00:14:55,533 --> 00:14:57,255
and you knew I would find that stone.

149
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:01,061
It was all one big calculated ploy wasn't it?

150
00:15:01,683 --> 00:15:06,203
If I had the foresight which you attribute to me,
I wouldn't need any ancient artifacts to help me.

151
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:11,056
If you've got any kind of foresight, you'll let me know where that
stone is right now, otherwise this is going to get very ugly.

152
00:15:11,349 --> 00:15:14,961
Oh, so now in addition to hurling accusations,
you decide to threaten me?

153
00:15:16,955 --> 00:15:20,075
You break into her apartment,
you go through her private things...

154
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:23,812
I assure you, breaking and entering
is not my style.

155
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:30,535
You're lost treasure isn't here Mr. Teague,
you'll have to look somewhere else. Good day.

156
00:15:36,868 --> 00:15:41,262
I'm not going anywhere, Luthor, until you give me
that stone and you convince me that you didn't take it.

157
00:15:41,468 --> 00:15:45,780
You storm in here, you accuse me of
some ham-fisted home invasion.

158
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:51,207
Why are you doing this? Is it an act?
An elaborate diversion?

159
00:15:51,455 --> 00:15:53,376
Don't turn this around on me!

160
00:15:55,138 --> 00:16:01,218
I think we both know there's nothing stronger
than the love between mother and son,

161
00:16:03,924 --> 00:16:06,118
and I'm sure Ms. Lang agrees.

162
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:44,198
I knew you had talents, but I didn't think
burglary was one of them.

163
00:17:44,517 --> 00:17:47,282
I swear I was going to pay it all back,
I'm not some criminal.

164
00:17:47,545 --> 00:17:49,796
You do a pretty good job of impersonating one.

165
00:17:52,226 --> 00:17:55,331
Look Lucy, I just don't get it, I mean why?

166
00:17:57,995 --> 00:18:02,275
Do you have any idea what it's like
to be different from everyone else?

167
00:18:02,551 --> 00:18:04,510
To be a total outsider?

168
00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:06,095
I might have an idea.

169
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,420
In my school, I'm surrounded
by the wealthiest kids in the world.

170
00:18:11,101 --> 00:18:16,747
So unless I wanna be the school's outcast,
I had to be like them, look like them.

171
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:21,560
Well I'm sure that's a very expensive undertaking.
But do you really have to resort to petty theft in order to fit in?

172
00:18:21,631 --> 00:18:24,113
Well I tried using my credit cards but they maxed out!

173
00:18:25,747 --> 00:18:30,744
So I went to this club owner who's known
for lending money to the credit-impaired.

174
00:18:31,647 --> 00:18:33,657
- You went to a loan shark?
- It's called something else in German,

175
00:18:33,928 --> 00:18:36,389
but yeah, that's the idea.

176
00:18:37,047 --> 00:18:39,623
Wait, so that's the guy that was
here the other day staring at you.

177
00:18:44,061 --> 00:18:45,637
All right look, how much do you owe him?

178
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:48,978
50,000 U.S. dollars.

179
00:18:49,743 --> 00:18:52,259
But most of its just bogus interest.

180
00:18:52,462 --> 00:18:55,797
- Lucy we've got to tell your father about this.
- No, I can't.

181
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:58,969
The generals convinced I'm the
embodiment of the perfect daughter.

182
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:00,744
Well at least we have to tell Lois.

183
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,359
I don't want to disappoint her.

184
00:19:03,796 --> 00:19:05,641
She's your sister, she'll understand.

185
00:19:08,331 --> 00:19:10,886
Not everyone has a family like yours Clark.

186
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,180
Please don't tell her.

187
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:27,921
I think the best thing for me to do is to just...
disappear for a while.

188
00:19:28,478 --> 00:19:29,544
Lucy wait.

189
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:36,638
If you're in some sort of trouble the best thing to do
is just stay here and keep a low profile.

190
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:41,858
Maybe there's something I can do to help.

191
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:56,832
His name is Marcus Becker, he's a bouncer
at a club called Kronos in Zürich,

192
00:19:57,079 --> 00:20:01,448
with a résumé chock full of felonies. Apparently this club
is kind of a front for the kind of people

193
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:03,967
that you don't want to own money to.

194
00:20:04,682 --> 00:20:06,382
We should just tell Lois.

195
00:20:06,731 --> 00:20:08,075
She doesn't have to.

196
00:20:09,204 --> 00:20:12,932
I knew her hop, skip, and jump over the Atlantic
wasn't because she missed her big sister,

197
00:20:13,184 --> 00:20:16,754
and if this guy is bothering Lucy, then I'm going
to find him, we're going to have a little talk.

198
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:22,082
Lois. Before you go all "Lifetime Heroine", remember
that this is not the school bully she's dealing with.

199
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:24,015
Seriously, she is in trouble.

200
00:20:24,466 --> 00:20:26,195
But I think I know someone who can help.

201
00:20:38,469 --> 00:20:40,856
Bravo, Lucy.
Excellent performance.

202
00:20:41,188 --> 00:20:43,733
Yeah, I had no idea the younger Lane
was such a virtuoso.

203
00:20:44,547 --> 00:20:47,335
Oh, apparently there's quite a bit
about the younger Lane we don't know.

204
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:51,324
Thanks Clark, you're pretty great
about keeping a secret.

205
00:20:51,513 --> 00:20:53,370
Lucy I want to help you, that's why I'm here.

206
00:20:54,806 --> 00:20:57,783
Lex, I was going to tell you about the money
but I think she already beat me to it.

207
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:02,396
And what money would that be?

208
00:21:02,623 --> 00:21:06,101
I didn't come here looking for a handout,
I can solve this problem by myself.

209
00:21:06,617 --> 00:21:10,875
Well as long as we're on the topic of personal finance,
how did you think you would be able to pay this money back?

210
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,957
Standing on the street corner,
playing your violin for loose change?

211
00:21:14,132 --> 00:21:17,024
- There's a reason why I didn't tell you.
- Look, I don't wanna have to say anything to the general about-

212
00:21:17,387 --> 00:21:19,883
You're not mom alright, so stop trying to be!

213
00:21:20,224 --> 00:21:21,960
Don't you dare bring mom into this...

214
00:21:22,198 --> 00:21:24,269
Ladies, please...

215
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:31,051
Lucy owes $50,000 to a guy in Switzerland.
He's come to Smallville to collect.

216
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,204
Now Lucy...

217
00:21:36,959 --> 00:21:39,789
how does a girl like you get
involved with a loan shark?

218
00:21:42,269 --> 00:21:44,035
It's a long story.

219
00:21:44,681 --> 00:21:50,374
But look, I didn't ask for anyone's help, not Clark, not
Lois, not you. I'm a big girl, I can handle this on my own.

220
00:21:50,456 --> 00:21:53,927
$50,000 is a lot to handle, even for a big girl.

221
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,630
Yeah, well I guess that's my problem.

222
00:21:58,954 --> 00:22:02,443
Lucy, before you walk out that door,
why don't you tell me what happened?

223
00:22:03,094 --> 00:22:05,919
I have the resources to deal with these kind of people.

224
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:14,425
They want bearer bonds, which are impossible
to trace, this isn't amateur hour.

225
00:22:14,514 --> 00:22:16,547
I thought you had a policy not to deal with extortionists.

226
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:20,199
This is different Clark. This isn't the
first time I've dealt with these people.

227
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:22,912
- Wait, you know Marcus Becker?
- I know the men he works for.

228
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:27,449
They are a German crime syndicate, and they've
repeatedly blocked my attempts to buy hotel in Zürich

229
00:22:27,678 --> 00:22:32,560
through intimidation and blackmail. If I get this guy in
custody, I'll have something to squeeze them with.

230
00:22:33,181 --> 00:22:35,623
So Lucy's just a pawn?

231
00:22:35,944 --> 00:22:38,433
I just have other reasons for helping her out.

232
00:22:40,578 --> 00:22:44,568
Becker wants me to meet him at an abandoned
warehouse at the corner of Market and Lyndon.

233
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:46,297
Lex, this isn't worth getting hurt over.

234
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:49,440
No one is getting hurt Clark.
All I'm doing is delivering the briefcase,

235
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:52,756
the GPS device inside will lead
my security team right to them.

236
00:22:52,968 --> 00:22:54,434
He said he only wants me there.

237
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,575
No, that's not going to happen.

238
00:22:59,524 --> 00:23:00,712
I'm going alone.

239
00:23:05,112 --> 00:23:11,327
100 grand, chrome wheels, and 13 speakers, and
instead of a back seat, oh yeah, I get the gear shift.

240
00:23:11,709 --> 00:23:13,062
Are we there yet?

241
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:16,081
Have you ever been in a car
and not uttered those words?

242
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:19,739
All I'm saying is that this guy isn't going
to be happy if we are not there on time.

243
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,283
He is not the kind of guy you want to piss off.

244
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:24,348
Relax, we're close.

245
00:23:28,574 --> 00:23:29,580
Damnit.

246
00:23:37,618 --> 00:23:39,036
Can you outrun them?

247
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:41,616
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

248
00:23:53,936 --> 00:23:55,431
Just stay put.

249
00:23:58,161 --> 00:23:59,626
Excuse me officer,

250
00:24:00,211 --> 00:24:05,370
I appreciate your need to fulfill your speeding ticket
quota but... can we make this quick?

251
00:24:05,633 --> 00:24:07,156
Put your hands over your head.

252
00:24:08,735 --> 00:24:09,726
What?

253
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:12,309
Put your hands up, now!

254
00:24:14,185 --> 00:24:16,737
Look, I think there's been a mistake,
I may have been speeding but -

255
00:24:17,129 --> 00:24:18,205
Shut up!

256
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,380
Go get the bonds, Mr. Luthor.

257
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,454
Oh my God.

258
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,093
No, no, no.
Just stay calm, okay?

259
00:24:41,191 --> 00:24:42,215
Nice try.

260
00:24:43,625 --> 00:24:45,034
Dump it in the bag.

261
00:24:58,692 --> 00:24:59,817
Thank you.

262
00:25:01,496 --> 00:25:02,717
and good night!

263
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,850
You wouldn't want Lucy
to be an only child, would you?

264
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:32,615
Take my word for it,
there's no cash on the premises.

265
00:25:33,343 --> 00:25:34,949
Where's Marcus Becker?

266
00:25:35,652 --> 00:25:36,888
Never heard of him.

267
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,766
Lex!

268
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:52,584
Clark, he's got the girls.

269
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:20,066
Somebody!

270
00:26:21,364 --> 00:26:24,994
It's no use.
We are totally and utterly screwed.

271
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:33,183
Oh, let's not jump to conclusions here. I have a history
of getting us out of the jams you get us into.

272
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:36,694
I'll think of something.

273
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:41,291
Lois, this isn't like us getting ourselves locked in the
mess hall pantry, or getting lost on our bikes in Bangkok.

274
00:26:48,931 --> 00:26:52,519
I don't get it, you got your money.
Why don't you go back home,

275
00:26:52,726 --> 00:26:56,327
eat some Swiss cheese, and live
happily ever after, you don't need us.

276
00:26:56,697 --> 00:27:01,314
But I do. The Luthor well has only
just been tapped. I'm here to strike it rich.

277
00:27:01,545 --> 00:27:03,675
You son of a bitch,
you're holding us for ransom?!

278
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:04,874
Lucy, zip it.

279
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:14,926
Let my sister go.
You don't need both of us.

280
00:27:15,018 --> 00:27:16,295
Sure I do.

281
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:20,433
A pair of Lanes, it definitely ups the ante.

282
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,954
The world would be a whole lot worse
without her in it than without me, okay?

283
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:29,879
She's the one with a future.
If she'd only learn to behave herself.

284
00:27:34,892 --> 00:27:36,592
Eat up girls.

285
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,329
How generous of you,
I thought you'd let us starve.

286
00:27:39,649 --> 00:27:42,145
The one with the sticker has no tomatoes.

287
00:27:46,242 --> 00:27:47,456
Lucy!

288
00:27:48,135 --> 00:27:49,119
Yeah?

289
00:27:49,693 --> 00:27:52,362
How did he know you don't like tomatoes?

290
00:27:57,571 --> 00:27:59,739
Lucy Lane has been conning us this whole time.

291
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:04,002
That's a pretty bold accusation, Clark.

292
00:28:05,252 --> 00:28:07,954
The drop-off was a fake,
there was no warehouse.

293
00:28:09,255 --> 00:28:11,958
And Lucy was the only one who knew about the GPS.

294
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:14,905
I mean, how else would Becker have
known to treat the briefcase like the plague?

295
00:28:15,190 --> 00:28:17,665
Becker's a pro, he could simply
be cautious about the money.

296
00:28:17,856 --> 00:28:20,851
It's all part of a bigger plan.
The way she accidentally woke me up

297
00:28:20,921 --> 00:28:23,798
on her way to steal from the Talon.
She knew I'd catch her in the act.

298
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:26,580
Her sob story about
not being able to fit in at school.

299
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:30,733
It was all a setup, in order to win my sympathies,
so I would come to you for the money.

300
00:28:33,884 --> 00:28:36,215
She played us like a Stratovarius.

301
00:28:36,863 --> 00:28:39,425
What I don't understand is why abduct Lois?

302
00:28:39,627 --> 00:28:42,050
I know it's a con,
but why kidnap your own sister?

303
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:44,547
Well they say sibling rivalries run deep.

304
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:47,375
Line 1, Mr. Luthor. It's Becker.

305
00:28:52,377 --> 00:28:53,795
Lex Luthor.

306
00:28:54,044 --> 00:29:01,076
Place $500,000 in bearer bonds inside the
trailer on Highway 54 just north of Cherry Hill.

307
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:02,662
That's not how it works.

308
00:29:06,354 --> 00:29:07,710
Clark?

309
00:29:09,804 --> 00:29:11,143
Clark?

310
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:22,121
I swear Lois, it wasn't
supposed to end up this way.

311
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:28,218
When Michael Hoover was throwing
dirt clods at you, who kicked his butt, huh?

312
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,590
Who was the one who let you sleep in her bed,
and listen to you snore every night after mom died?

313
00:29:35,907 --> 00:29:37,440
Lois, I'm sorry.

314
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:39,794
Well sorry is not good enough!
I wanna know why.

315
00:29:41,803 --> 00:29:47,248
I wanna know why you turned to a life of crime
when you have everything in the world going for you!

316
00:29:47,306 --> 00:29:49,500
You're as close to friggin' perfect as it gets!

317
00:29:49,515 --> 00:29:52,030
Because that's what the general always wanted!

318
00:29:52,276 --> 00:29:54,867
I just went along and played the part.

319
00:29:56,826 --> 00:29:59,453
From the day I left for school,
all I wanted was to go home.

320
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:01,720
Why didn't you tell the general that?

321
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,763
How could I?
It was clear he didn't want me around.

322
00:30:07,537 --> 00:30:09,261
He wanted you.

323
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:13,488
What are you talking about?

324
00:30:14,386 --> 00:30:17,193
Why do you think he sent me off to school after mom died?

325
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:22,147
He sent you off to school because you were brilliant,
and deserved the best education available.

326
00:30:23,794 --> 00:30:25,821
Well you can think whatever you want.

327
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:29,557
But the fact is I have always envied you.

328
00:30:31,447 --> 00:30:32,452
Me?

329
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,984
I was being dragged around the world
like a spare piece of luggage.

330
00:30:39,745 --> 00:30:42,407
But you had something I never had.

331
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:43,559
What?

332
00:30:45,138 --> 00:30:46,544
You had dad.

333
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:50,563
Luce,

334
00:30:51,742 --> 00:30:54,439
I don't think either of us ever had Dad.

335
00:31:24,618 --> 00:31:26,900
Sorry I got you into this Lois.

336
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:30,677
Don't worry about it,
you've been in far worse trouble than this.

337
00:32:47,552 --> 00:32:49,483
We're pulling over... now!

338
00:33:28,903 --> 00:33:30,002
How are you feeling?

339
00:33:30,305 --> 00:33:33,351
Well, I have a newfound
appreciation for seat belts, I can tell you that.

340
00:33:36,521 --> 00:33:38,172
What are you going to do with my sister?

341
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:42,557
I don't have a choice.
I have to notify the authorities.

342
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:47,356
Hey... wait!

343
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,818
I'm sorry.

344
00:33:52,373 --> 00:33:53,655
Lucy!

345
00:34:15,301 --> 00:34:17,309
Lex.
Any luck finding Lucy?

346
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:21,977
No, all that turned up was the car,
minus my $50,000.

347
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:30,319
Look Lex, I know that Lois feels really badly about this,
but there's really no way she's going to be able to-

348
00:34:30,525 --> 00:34:35,983
Clark, I'm not here to collect. Besides, having Becker in
custody is worth a lot more to me than 50 grand.

349
00:34:37,984 --> 00:34:40,015
Your deal in Zürich.

350
00:34:41,407 --> 00:34:43,437
Well I'm glad that someone came out of this ahead.

351
00:34:44,963 --> 00:34:46,412
So how's Lois?

352
00:34:46,973 --> 00:34:50,265
Um, I don't know,
she hasn't said anything all day.

353
00:34:53,348 --> 00:34:56,363
But I don't know why Lucy would run away,
I mean Lois is her family.

354
00:34:58,316 --> 00:35:01,932
Just because you have the same blood running
through your veins, doesn't make you family.

355
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:05,616
Look at us Clark.

356
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,227
I'm a product of my fathers breeding.

357
00:35:10,112 --> 00:35:11,638
He needed an heir.

358
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,933
But your parents chose you out of love.

359
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:18,630
I'd take your family any day of the week.

360
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:26,045
I just think Lois and Lucy could have been closer.

361
00:35:26,297 --> 00:35:28,138
We'll hopefully one day they will be.

362
00:35:28,446 --> 00:35:33,044
But that's up to them. So quit blaming
yourself for what happened.

363
00:35:35,474 --> 00:35:36,437
Lex.

364
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,924
Do you ever miss not having a sibling?

365
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:47,688
I used to.

366
00:35:50,083 --> 00:35:51,662
Until I met you, Clark.

367
00:35:52,697 --> 00:35:55,906
You're closer to me than any blood brother.

368
00:36:19,097 --> 00:36:20,684
- Hey!
- Hey.

369
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,640
Have you recovered from hurricane Lucy yet?

370
00:36:22,864 --> 00:36:24,996
Oh I just hope she changes her ways
before she gets herself hurt.

371
00:36:25,805 --> 00:36:29,419
You know it never fails, keeping secrets
always leads to trouble.

372
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:33,581
I don't know which is more difficult, being the one
keeping the secret, or the one who's being duped.

373
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,647
Have you talked to Lois?

374
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:39,852
She's been holed up in her room all day.
She took it all pretty hard.

375
00:36:40,295 --> 00:36:44,837
Well ever since I can remember, the one thing Lois has
always wanted is to protect her little sister.

376
00:36:45,996 --> 00:36:48,853
I guess no matter how bad you want to,
you just can't save everyone.

377
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:54,919
But it doesn't stop you from trying,
does it Clark?

378
00:37:03,912 --> 00:37:07,212
Dad, clearly the idea of personal space is lost on you.

379
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:13,110
Lex, one of your employees paid me a visit recently,
and I wasn't clear whether it was official business,

380
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:15,067
or what it was.

381
00:37:15,371 --> 00:37:17,882
As far as I know, our outstanding business is finished.

382
00:37:18,306 --> 00:37:24,637
Well, he... Jason Teague, that's who it was, accused me
of taking something that didn't belong to me.

383
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,830
Of stealing.

384
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,755
Well it wouldn't be the first time.

385
00:37:29,665 --> 00:37:32,795
Be that as it may, the accusation was false.

386
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,242
But given what's missing, I almost wish I was guilty.

387
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,333
What was it?

388
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:47,151
You know the answer to that question, Lex,
you're the one who took it from him.

389
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,940
Dad, if you want to play games,
there's a deck of cards in the parlor.

390
00:37:52,221 --> 00:37:57,590
Let's talk about games. You hire someone to
travel to China to search for an ancient artifact.

391
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:03,196
He finds it, he steals it, but he keeps it for himself.
Then you have to steal it back from him.

392
00:38:04,939 --> 00:38:08,156
You've turned "hot potato" into an art form, son.

393
00:38:09,508 --> 00:38:12,241
Jason Teague found the stone?

394
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:21,801
Either you are the best con man in the world,
or you are truly unbelievably naïve.

395
00:38:26,542 --> 00:38:28,134
Good afternoon, Lex.

396
00:39:28,748 --> 00:39:32,545
I thought you said that telescopes
were for geeks and stalkers.

397
00:39:32,837 --> 00:39:36,529
Yeah well, as was proven over the last few days,
I can seriously misjudge people.

398
00:39:37,402 --> 00:39:40,708
You know, if you've come to kick me off the farm,
I completely understand.

399
00:39:42,888 --> 00:39:47,031
Yeah, um... actually I came here to tell you
we have food in the oven, if you're hungry.

400
00:39:48,516 --> 00:39:50,742
Thanks.

401
00:39:52,337 --> 00:39:53,511
How are you holding up?

402
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,308
Oh, just got off the phone with the general.

403
00:39:55,939 --> 00:39:57,791
Oh, that was all the screaming
I heard from the house.

404
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:03,453
Yeah, well apparently he is very
disappointed in me for letting this happen,

405
00:40:03,817 --> 00:40:07,869
and as far as the family chain of command
goes, I am the weakest link.

406
00:40:10,486 --> 00:40:12,273
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

407
00:40:13,041 --> 00:40:19,041
You know, there's something cathartic
about telling a 3-star general to go to hell.

408
00:40:20,817 --> 00:40:24,028
You know, all these years I thought
I had my sister pegged but...

409
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:28,580
in reality, she's a complete stranger to me.

410
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:35,079
Even if that were true, I think that if she called
you tomorrow, you'd be there in the second to help her.

411
00:40:37,772 --> 00:40:40,825
Yeah I would. She's my sister.

412
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,417
I don't think Lucy is all that bad.

413
00:40:48,089 --> 00:40:50,249
You're amazing, "Smallville".

414
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:54,819
You always look for the best in people,
even when they walk all over you.

415
00:40:55,217 --> 00:40:57,353
I guess that explains why we're friends.

416
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,292
Oh, we're friends now?

417
00:40:59,705 --> 00:41:02,247
Well, I won't tell anyone if you don't.
