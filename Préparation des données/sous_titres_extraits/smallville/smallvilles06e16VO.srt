THE MARRIGE CEREMONY UNITING
Ms.Lana Lang AND Mr.Alexander Luthor

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,100
* You could be happy *

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,000
*and I won't know *

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:13,000
* But you weren't happy the day I *

5
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,100
* watched you go *

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,500
* It's too late to remind you*

7
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,700
* how we were *

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,100
* most of what I remember *

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,000
* makes me sure *

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,700
* I should have stopped you from walking *

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:43,000
* out the door *

12
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,800
* You could be happy, I hope you are *

13
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,900
* You made me happier than I'd been by far *

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,200
* Somehow everything I own smells of you *

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:13,200
* And for the tiniest moment *

16
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,800
* it's all not true *

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,400
* Do the things that you always *

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,400
* wanted to *

19
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,600
* Without me there to hold you back *

20
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,900
* don't think, just do *

21
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:43,200
* More than anything I want to see you, girl *

22
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,000
* Take a glorious bite out *

23
00:01:48,200 --> 00:02:18,200
* of the  whole world *

And do you, lana lang,

28
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,400
take alexander luthor to be your husband

29
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,000
in the holy state of matrimony?

30
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Do you promise to love him,comfort him,

31
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,700
honor, and keep him
in sickness and in health,

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,100
for richer, for poorer,

33
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,500
and forsaking all others,
as long as you both shall live?

34
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,400
I do.

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Lex!
Oh, my god, lex!

36
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,000
Lex!

37
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,600
I saved you.

38
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,700
I loved him.

39
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
You don't mean that.

40
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,200
Lana!

41
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,400
No!

00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,800
Wedding Day
11:03am

43
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,400
Shouldn't you be at the luthor
mansion, arranging flowers?

44
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,600
Well, that's just it.

45
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,500
I am at the luthor mansion.

46
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,400
I just kind of need your help.

47
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,900
Where are you?

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,200
Downstairs in the wine cellar.

49
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,000
-Chloe?
-Clark?

50
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,000
Chloe?

51
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:24,000
Hurry.I'm freezing in here.

52
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,400
The handle broke, chloe.

53
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,600
Hold on.

54
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,800
Thank you so much.

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,500
If you want a bottle of win
eat 11:00 in the morning,

56
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,800
go for a red.

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,700
I am so sorry.

58
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,400
Lana hid lex's wedding presentdown here,

59
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:52,200
and she asked me to go get it
and then the door...shut.

60
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,300
I better go.

61
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,000
That's it?

62
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,600
You filled yourdamsel-in-distress
 quota for the day,

63
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,200
and you're just...gonna walk away?

64
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
What am I supposed to do?

65
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,700
I guess I always just thought that

66
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,600
you would sweep inand save the day,

67
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,100
but you're not gonna do that,are you?

68
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,700
If lana didn't wantto marry lex, she wouldn'T.

69
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,100
Lana's not my hero, clark -- you are.

70
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,900
And this whole idea that you're
still hiding who you really are,

71
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,200
that you're giving up the one
person that you totally love --

72
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,100
-I'm protecting her.
-Good job.

73
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,100
She's marrying a monster
and trapping herselfinto a loveless life.

74
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,300
Oh, you thinkthis is easy for me?

75
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,300
I think it's easierthan getting hurt.

76
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,100
You don't hesitate to runinto a burning building

77
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,900
or jump in front of a bullet

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
because nothing can penetrate
that iron flesh of yours.

79
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,200
But the one time saving lana

80
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,600
means putting your hearton the line,

81
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,500
the man of steelis nowhere to be found.

82
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,300
Letting lana go is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do, chloe.

83
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,600
If you don't know that,then you don't
know meas well as I thought you did.

84
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,800
To JK
The love of my life,MK

85
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,500
How'd you know dad was the one?

86
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,800
How'd you know he felt the same way?

87
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:49,500
I think when you're young,
like you are,like we were...

88
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,200
nothing is that simple.

89
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,100
I know this is a really hard dayfor you, clark.

90
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,400
I can't help but wonder...

91
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,000
...if all those thingsI told myself --

92
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:28,100
that knowing the truth about me
would be too muchfor lana to handle,

93
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,700
that if she knew my secret,she'd be in danger...

94
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,200
What if I just made up all those excuses
'cause I was scared?

95
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,200
Then you'd be just like the rest of us.

96
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,400
What do you mean?

97
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,800
Your father and i almost didn't get married.

98
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,800
I broke it off after a year.

99
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,300
We had a horrible argument,

100
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,400
and I thought I'd never see him again.

101
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,500
You know, we came from such different worlds.

102
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,100
Our families,the paths we were on --

103
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,300
everything was stacked against us.

104
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,100
Then why'd you getback together?

105
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,900
Because I...

106
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,900
I couldn't stop thinking about him.

107
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,500
What if I take that risk...

108
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,700
...and lana really is happy with lex?

109
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,200
All I can tell you, clark,is that,

110
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,800
if I hadn't taken that chance,

111
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,300
I would have lost everything

112
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,100
that's ever meant some thing to me.

113
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,400
Clark.

114
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,800
I can't let yougo through with this...

115
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,800
not unless you know everything.

116
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,200
Clark, it's okay.You don't have to explain.

117
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,900
-I owe it to you.
-No, you don't

118
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,100
owe me anything.

119
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,500
I'm the one who's been in denial.

120
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,100
I thought the love that I have
for lex would be enough.

121
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:38,700
But I can't keep turning my back
on the truth.

122
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,300
What are you saying?

123
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm not going to marry lex.

124
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,100
Look, I don't have time to explain right now.

125
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,100
I'll meet you at the barn at 5:00.

126
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,000
You have to go.I'll be there -- I promise.

127
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,500
Go.

128
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,600
Wedding Day
7:14am

129
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,200
How'd you sleep?

130
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,600
Like a baby.

131
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,200
Me too.

132
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,600
But I don't know if I can wait.

133
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,900
How about we just run off and elope?

134
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,500
That would be a big waste of 400 game hens.

135
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:16,100
It's a big day.It's okay to be nervous.

136
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,300
I know.

137
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,200
I just have a few loose ends I need to tie up.

138
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:24,200
In fact, I have to go and meet chloe
so I should get ready.

139
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,100
I'll see you at the church.

140
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,600
Busy day at the office?

141
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,300
I just had some papers to sign before the wedding.

142
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,200
Or could it be you're avoiding the fact

143
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,800
that you've got no one to be
with today and nothing to do?

144
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,100
Fine, dad.You pegged me.

145
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,100
I'm a little nervous.

146
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,600
Do you remember,when you were just a little boy,

147
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,600
I'd bring you up here to the office?

148
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,100
I used to pretend it was all mine to control,

149
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:23,600
like I could just reach down
 and move all the cars,

150
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,400
as if they were toys...

151
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,900
pull all the strings and make
people do what I wanted.

152
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,900
But I guess it's all out of your control, isn't it?

153
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,300
I should hope I taught you better than that.

154
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,200
You know, dad, ever since I've been with lana,

155
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,900
I wake up wondering,

156
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,600
"is today gonna be the day
when she sees who I really am?"

157
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,000
What if she doesn't show?

158
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,400
I honestly don't know
what my life is without her.

159
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,600
What would you be willing to do

160
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,000
to make sure that lana is standing next to you

161
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:08,500
at the altarthis afternoon?

162
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,700
Anything.

163
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,100
Then she will be --I promise you.

164
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,600
It's my wedding day.Whatever it is, it can wait.

165
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,600
Is something wrong?

166
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,700
I'll be right there.

167
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,600
Wedding Day
4:43pm

168
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:58,200
Dr. Langston...

169
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,100
...is this about lana?

170
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Is she okay?

171
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,100
Oh, that's a bit ambiguous
after what you've done to her.

172
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:13,400
In a few minutes,I'm gonna be exchanging rings

173
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,800
directly above where you're standing.

174
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,600
What was so urgent it couldn't wait?

175
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,200
Trust me, lex.

176
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,700
I wouldn't want anything
to come between youand your beautiful bride --

177
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:28,600
for instance,the truth about her condition.

178
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:36,600
For your sake, I hope
I'm not understanding you.

179
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,700
Consider it hazard payfor the dangerous --

180
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,000
not to mention unethical --
position you've put me infor months.

181
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,300
And today's the day you hold the most leverage.

182
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,600
Wire $2 million to this account,

183
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,500
or ms. Lang will know everything.

184
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I don't give into blackmail.

185
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,900
Oh, I think you will.

186
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,200
No man sinks as low as you have

187
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,200
if he isn't drivenby desperation.

188
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,200
Knowing what you've kept from her,

189
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,800
I wouldn't recommend putting her love tthe test.

190
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,400
I won't let youtake her away from me!

191
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,200
I'll be right there.

192
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,900
Is it time?

193
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,300
It was...

194
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,600
10 minutes ago.

195
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,100
Lana's not here,and no one
knows where she is.

196
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,500
Lana!

197
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:33,200
Wedding Day 7:09am

198
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,600
OTER SAVES STUDENT!

199
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,400
LOCAL GIRL SURVIVES TORNADO

200
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,200
How'd you sleep?

201
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,600
Like a baby.

202
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,100
Me too.

203
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,500
But I don't knowif I can wait.

204
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
How about we just run offand elope?

205
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,700
That would be a pretty big
wasteof 400 game hens.

206
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,000
It's a big day.
It's okay to be nervous.

207
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,800
I know.

208
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,100
I just have a few loose ends
that I need to tie up.

209
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,100
In fact, I have to go meetchloe,
so I should get ready.

210
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,100
I'll see youat the church.

211
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,600
THE MARRIAGE CEREMONY UNITING
Ms.LanaLang AND Mr.Alexander Luther

212
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,000
Aunt nell.

213
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,400
I can't tell you how long

214
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,300
I've been looking forwardto this day.

215
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,800
I'm so proud of you.

216
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,900
I wouldn't have missed
this dayfor anything.

217
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,000
I know***

218
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,500
Lana...

219
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,800
this may be the most important
day of your life.

220
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,300
what's wrong?

221
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
It's just...

222
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,100
If there were something
that youhad to put past 

223
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,200
you to get on with your life

224
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:56,000
and you tried every way
thatwas fair and honest to do that

225
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,600
and nothing worked...

226
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,700
...is it really wrong to
bend the rules just once?

227
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,900
Well, what would put those doubts to rest?

228
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,400
The truth.

229
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
If you are going to promise
your heart to lex,

230
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,700
you cannot go to that
altarwith anything unresolved.

231
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,700
When it comes to protecting ourselves...

232
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,500
...we do what we have to do,lana.

233
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,200
Wedding Day 10:50am

234
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,500
Okay, so you have your final
dress fitting at 3:00,

235
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,100
the limo's picking you upat 3:30,

236
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,300
and you have wedding photos
outside the church

237
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,600
and naked-male jello wrestling at 5:00.

238
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,900
Lana?

239
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Look at me.

240
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,700
You didn't sleep at all
last night, did you?

241
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,600
There's been a lot of pressure.

242
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,000
Since this is your big day,

243
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,900
I'll pretend 
that I don't see right through that.

244
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,700
I think that's a great idea.

245
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
Okay.

246
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,500
What else can I do?

247
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,100
Well, if you don't mind,

248
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,800
I hid lex's wedding gift
in the wine cellar

249
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,500
so he wouldn't find it.

250
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,300
I guess "personal gofer" falls under
the umbrella of "maid of honor."

251
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,900
Oh, um,what does it look like?

252
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,600
Um, it is behind the
bollinger in the cooler.

253
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,500
It's a little blue box
with a white bow.

254
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,900
- Okay.
- Thank you.

255
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,000
Holy dom pérignon.

256
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Perfect.

257
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,800
Okay.

258
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,400
Come on, lana.Pick up.

259
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,800
Pick up. Pick up.Pick up. Pick up.

260
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,200
Shoot.

261
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:04,500
Shouldn't you be at the luthormansion,
arranging flowers?

262
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:05,700
That's just it.

263
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,900
I am at the mansion,
butI kind of need your help.

264
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,900
Where are you?

265
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Downstairs in the wine cellar.

266
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,800
Chloe?

267
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,200
Clark?

268
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,700
Chloe?

269
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,600
Hurry.I'm freezing in here.

270
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,900
The handle broke, chloe.

271
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,700
Hold on.

272
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,000
Thank you so much.

273
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,900
nextIf you want a bottle of 
wineat 11:00 in the morning,

274
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,700
go for a red.

275
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,500
Yeah, I'm so, so sorry.

276
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I-I know you'd rather be tied
to a boulder of kryptonite

277
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,700
than come down here for ground zero
of the luthor/lang wedding,

278
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,900
but I didn't have a choice.

279
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:50,800
It wasn't my fault.

280
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,600
Lana hid lex's wedding present down here,

281
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,100
and she asked meto come down and get it,

282
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,800
and then the door shut.

283
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,000
I better go.

284
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,600
Wait, that's it?

285
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,500
You filled your damsel-in-distress quota
for the day,

286
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,200
and you're just gonna walk away?

287
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,000
Chloe,what am I supposed to do?

288
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:11,000
I guess I just always figured
you'd sweep in

289
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,300
at the last minute ansave the day,

290
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,500
but you're not gonna do that,are you?

291
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,500
If lana didn't want to marry lex,
she wouldn'T.

292
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,800
Yeah, but lana's not my hero,
clark -- you are.

293
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,600
And this whole idea

294
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
that you haven't told her
who you really are,

295
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,400
that you're giving up the person
that you totally love --

296
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,600
- Because... 
- I'm protecting her.

297
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,500
Good job.

298
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,000
She's marrying a monster,

299
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,500
and she's gonna be trapped
in a loveless life.

300
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,700
You think this is easy for me?

301
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,100
I think it's easier than getting hurt.

302
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,500
Clark, you don't hesitate
to run into a burning building

303
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,300
or jump in front of a bullet

304
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,900
because nothing can penetrate
that iron flesh of yours.

305
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,700
But the one time saving lana

306
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,200
means putting your hear ton the line,

307
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:54,000
the man of steelis nowhere to be found.

308
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,400
Giving up lana is the hardest thing
I've everhad to do in my life.

309
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,200
If you don't know that,

310
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,800
you don't know me very well.

311
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,100
Wedding Day 1:35pm

312
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,900
Clark.

313
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,200
I cannot let you go through with this...

314
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,500
not untilyou know everything.

315
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Clark, it's okay.

316
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,600
You don't have to explain.

317
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,300
I owe it to you.

318
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,900
No, you don'towe me anything.

319
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
I'm the onewho's been in denial.

320
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,400
And I thought that the love that
I have for lex would be enough,

321
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,500
but I can't keep turning my back
on the truth.

322
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,500
What are you saying?

323
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,000
I'm not marrying lex.

324
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,400
Look, I don't have time
to explain right now.

325
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
I'll meet you at the barnat 5:00.

326
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:23,600
You have to go.

327
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,000
I'll be there -- 

328
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,900
I promise.

329
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,600
Go.

330
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,300
Ms. Lang...

331
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,800
Shouldn't yoube leaving for the church?

332
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:58,000
What's this?

333
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,200
Dear lex,I'm so sorry,
but I can't go through with this

334
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,300
This will destroy lex.

335
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,800
Mr. Luthor, I'm sorry, 
but this is none of your business.

336
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,200
Well,I'm making it my business.

337
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,600
I can't let you call off the wedding.

338
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,300
Things have changed,

339
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,800
and it wouldn't be fair to 
lex to pretend like they haven'T.

340
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,700
You know clark's secret,don't you?

341
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,200
I've been watching you since
you started seeing my son,

342
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,600
and you've been getting
closer and closer

343
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,900
to finding out the shocking
truth about clark kent.

344
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,400
What a surpriseit must have been

345
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,600
to realize clark has kept up
the deception for so long,

346
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,800
right under your nose.

347
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,500
He was trying to protect me.

348
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,800
And he's not gonna let you
threaten me now.

349
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,800
You think clark's invincible.

350
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,300
It's not so.Like every hero,

351
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,200
he hasan achilles' heel, a weakness.

352
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,900
I know what it is.

353
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,500
And I knowthat it could kill him.

354
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,300
No.

355
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,400
You could never hurt him.

356
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:19,900
Would you bet...

357
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,200
clark's life on that?

358
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,600
I give you my word,ms. Lang,

359
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,500
if you don't honor the promise

360
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
that you've made to my son

361
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,800
or I find out you've told anyone
about this conversation,

362
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:36,400
I will kill clark kent.

363
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,500
She didn'ttell you anything?

364
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,900
No, she just vanished.
She won't answer her cell.

365
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,300
Sorry, lex,I don't know what to say,

366
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:17,100
but I'm sure there's an
explanation for all this.

367
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,900
Father, did lana say anything to you,

368
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
anything that might have indicated...

369
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
be patient, lex.
Give her a little more time.

370
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,300
Wedding-day jittersare to be expected.

371
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,400
She's not coming.

372
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,700
I've loved you since
the first moment I saw you.

373
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:16,100
Will you marry me?

374
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,200
It's too corny, huh?

375
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,600
Do you, alexander luthor,

376
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,700
take lana langto be your wife

377
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,900
in the holy state of matrimony?

378
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,400
Do you promise to love her,comfort her,

379
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,500
honor, and keep her,

380
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,000
in sickness and in health,

381
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,900
for richer, for poorer,

382
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:11,000
and forsaking all others,
as long as you bothshall live?

383
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,800
I do.

384
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,800
And do you, lana lang,

385
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,400
take alexander luthor to be your husband

386
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,700
in the holy state of matrimony?

387
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,200
Do you promise to love him,comfort him,

388
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:39,300
honor, and keep him,

389
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,000
in sickness and in health,

390
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,000
for richer, for poorer,

391
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,900
and forsaking all others,

392
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,500
as long as you bothshall live?

393
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
I do.

394
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:21,800
May I present to youmr.
And mrs. Alexander luthor?

395
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,400
I never thought it was
possible to be this happy.

396
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,500
How did I ever turn out to be the man 

397
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,400
who gets to spend
the rest of his life with you?

398
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,700
Okay.

399
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,000
I'll just get my things...mrs. Luthor.

400
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,100
I'll be right there.

401
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
I waited for you.

402
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
Clark.

403
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,800
What happened?

404
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,400
I'm -- I'm really sorry.I, uh,

405
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,800
I didn't mean to hurt you...

406
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,900
but I want to be with lex.

407
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,800
That's not true.

408
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,000
He got to you, didn't he?

409
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,600
No, please, just believe meand let it go.

410
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,200
Let it go?

411
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,900
Let it go?!Lana, I love you.

412
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,300
I love you.

413
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,200
Clark, don't.

414
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,200
Tell me what he did.

415
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,600
What did lex do?
You don't have to stay with him.

416
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,200
He didn't do anything.
I've made my decision.

417
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,300
I just want to be with him.

418
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,500
Why do you keep saying that?

419
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,400
Lana, we should be together.

420
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,600
I want this more than
I've ever wanted anything,

421
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,500
and I know that you do, too.

422
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,000
I've --I've had a change of heart.

423
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,900
You don't mean that.

424
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,900
Is this because of my secret?

425
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,300
Lana, I'll tell you.

426
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:07,600
I'm not like everyone else.

427
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:09,000
- I'm --
- no, clark, you --

428
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:11,100
- you have to go.
- No!

429
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,500
No...

430
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,200
not untilyou look me in the eye

431
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,700
and you tell me

432
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,700
that you'd rather spend the rest
of your life with lex luthor

433
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,300
instead of me.

434
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,800
I'm sorry, clark.

435
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,200
I love lex.

436
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
Congratulations, son.

437
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,700
Thanks, dad.

438
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,500
And why do I get the feeling
that's not all you came to say?

439
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,400
Good to seethe euphoria
of your wedding day

440
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,500
hasn't temperedyour cynicism.

441
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,700
I guess old habits die hard.

442
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,200
And***,Aren't they?

443
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:22,800
Do you sit up at night,
practicing this stuff?

444
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,500
How could you be so stupid?

445
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,000
A grown manon his wedding day,

446
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,300
and you need me to come to the rescue again --

447
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
you are pathetic.

448
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,400
I don't knowwhat you're talking about.

449
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,600
Don't play the fool with me,lex.

450
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:42,500
There's a crypt down below
that has gottena little overcrowded.

451
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,600
- It was an accident.
- Of course it was.

452
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,200
You don't have the gutsto
plan a successful murder.

453
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:59,200
And if anyone should discover
that the fresh corpse downstairs

454
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,200
happens to be that
of your bride's physician,

455
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:05,800
they just might stumble onto
thetruth about lana's pregnancy.

456
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:11,100
She's made a desperate manof you, lex.

457
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,900
Okay.

458
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,100
You win.

459
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,400
Whatever you want,it's yours --

460
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,400
control of luthorcorp, 33.1.

461
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,600
You don't have to worry,lex.

462
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,200
You'll know when it's time
for me to collect.

463
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,200
Thanks, dad.

464
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,900
Sorry.I didn't mean to interrupt.

465
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:48,400
Mrs. Luthor.

466
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,900
