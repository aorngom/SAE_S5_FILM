1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,446
Cut!

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,724
All right, you have been
listening to the next set up.

3
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:23,003
- Ok, fine.
- What have you seen here?

4
00:00:23,827 --> 00:00:25,884
- Chloe.
- Hey!

5
00:00:25,983 --> 00:00:28,539
Thanks to you, Smallville's
finally getting a close-up.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,468
You know, when I said they could
film at the farm, I didn't realize...

7
00:00:30,503 --> 00:00:32,473
that half of Hollywood
would show up at my doorstep.

8
00:00:32,511 --> 00:00:35,497
At least revel in the irony that
they've chosen a single-theater town...

9
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:37,979
to shoot their bazillion-dollars
"Warrior Angel" film.

10
00:00:38,014 --> 00:00:39,746
I guess I never really
got into comic books.

11
00:00:39,804 --> 00:00:43,215
Oh, come on. Who doesn't love
the story of a small-town boy...

12
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,482
who grows up to save the
world from the evil Devilicus?

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:49,215
I didn't know you were
such an avid follower.

14
00:00:50,121 --> 00:00:51,491
I'm not.

15
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,375
It's just right now, fiction's
a lot more appealing than reality.

16
00:00:56,258 --> 00:00:58,806
I mean, you know,
dating is so overrated.

17
00:00:58,889 --> 00:01:01,393
Who really need
the extra added headache of...

18
00:01:01,679 --> 00:01:05,744
worrying about tables for two and
wardrobe remorse on a movie night.

19
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:15,517
In other words, I've had plenty of free time
to create Kara's fake back-story.

20
00:01:16,056 --> 00:01:19,268
Your cousin's secret identity
is practically Google-proof.

21
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:20,864
That's great.

22
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:23,822
Maybe when she clears her head
and comes home, she'll appreciate it.

23
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,247
Sorry, guys.
Got to move you back.

24
00:01:28,902 --> 00:01:31,469
- Ok, place, please!
- All that for one star.

25
00:01:31,562 --> 00:01:35,776
Clark, Rachel Davenport is not just a star.
She's practically her own constellation.

26
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:38,049
I mean, don't you watch movies at all?

27
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,704
Turns out miss super diva put a
moratorium on all press interviews.

28
00:01:44,178 --> 00:01:48,746
God, an exclusive with her would definitely
put a snap back into my editor's suspenders.

29
00:01:49,106 --> 00:01:50,568
And roll sound!

30
00:01:50,621 --> 00:01:51,948
Roll camera!

31
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:53,441
Here we go.

32
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:55,384
Ok, roll playback.

33
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,210
And...

34
00:02:00,352 --> 00:02:01,160
action.

35
00:02:01,178 --> 00:02:03,623
Steven, you won't believe
the photos I got us, baby.

36
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,788
Meet me at the French place in an hour.

37
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,723
And here we go...

38
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:12,860
Good.

39
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:15,560
Cut.

40
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:18,036
That was perfect.

41
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:24,438
Rachel, that's a cut.

42
00:02:26,033 --> 00:02:27,479
What the hell?

43
00:02:27,876 --> 00:02:29,630
Rachel, that's a cut.

44
00:02:30,732 --> 00:02:32,615
Oh, my god. No!

45
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:34,715
Is it supposed to be like this?

46
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:40,713
Oh, my god!
Somebody help me!

47
00:02:40,985 --> 00:02:43,034
Somebody help me!

48
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:07,107
So, you just totally
saved my life.

49
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,253
You're amazing.

50
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:17,672
Hey.

51
00:04:18,695 --> 00:04:21,955
I can think of other ways
to burn calories.

52
00:04:24,011 --> 00:04:26,550
- I didn't hear you to come in last night.
- I know.

53
00:04:26,606 --> 00:04:29,448
You were already asleep
when I got home from Nell's.

54
00:04:30,244 --> 00:04:33,301
And you looked so cute,
I couldn't bear to wake you.

55
00:04:36,357 --> 00:04:39,329
But even heroes
need their beauty sleep.

56
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:42,103
LOCAL HERO CLARK KENT
SAVES HOLLYWOOD STARLET

57
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:46,608
After all this years of reading these articles,
you'd think I would have figured it out.

58
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,724
I guess people only see
what they think is possible.

59
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:53,967
Well, I, or one,
am glad I've seen the light.

60
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,448
And I think the spotlight
is better suited in Hollywood.

61
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,501
Clark Kent?

62
00:05:10,915 --> 00:05:14,952
Ms. Rachel Davenport is requesting
your company on the set.

63
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:19,471
Looks like I'm not your only fan.

64
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,220
Rachel is very busy, so keep it short
and don't ask for an autograph.

65
00:05:36,038 --> 00:05:37,297
No problem.

66
00:05:47,334 --> 00:05:49,809
Miss Davenport,
Your guest has arrived.

67
00:05:53,995 --> 00:05:55,930
Attention, everyone.

68
00:05:55,936 --> 00:05:58,498
Mr. Kent and I need a little one-on-one.

69
00:05:58,943 --> 00:06:01,998
See you back in five minutes.
Thank you.

70
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:05,946
Today we shoot
the famous date scene.

71
00:06:06,546 --> 00:06:08,837
Warrior Angel's about
to stand me up.

72
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,039
It's heartbreaking.

73
00:06:11,725 --> 00:06:14,964
In his defense,
I'm sure he has a good excuse.

74
00:06:16,069 --> 00:06:21,190
Anyway, I just wanted to
thank you... personally.

75
00:06:22,165 --> 00:06:23,915
That was really brave,
what you did.

76
00:06:23,998 --> 00:06:26,137
After what happened, I'm surprised
you're not in the hospital.

77
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:30,064
God, no. I got my start
On a medical drama.

78
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:35,116
Two seasons of bad memories.

79
00:06:39,186 --> 00:06:43,166
You mean you haven't memorized
my entire acting repertoire?

80
00:06:43,453 --> 00:06:45,151
You know, I don't watch
a lot of movies.

81
00:06:45,174 --> 00:06:47,531
Clark, I'm kidding.

82
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:52,853
You know, it's refreshing
for someone to see the real me,

83
00:06:53,036 --> 00:06:55,122
Not just the tabloid version.

84
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,567
I'm sorry to interrupt,
Ms. Davenport, but...

85
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:02,923
this girl said she absolutely
needed to speak to Clark.

86
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:04,793
Rachel, this is my friend
Chloe Sullivan.

87
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:07,131
She works the Daily Planet
She'd love to interview you.

88
00:07:07,151 --> 00:07:09,594
- Hi.
- Hi.

89
00:07:10,374 --> 00:07:13,974
Usually I don't give interviews,
but you know what?

90
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:16,947
For a friend of Clark's...
sure thing.

91
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,784
Wow. Okay.

92
00:07:20,618 --> 00:07:24,242
Except I'm... I'm afraid I'm
actually in line behind the sheriff.

93
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:27,660
After you crashed, the police
autopsied your vehicle,

94
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:31,433
and it looks like someone jimmied
the accelerator and cut the brake line.

95
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:34,078
No offense, Ms. Davenport but...

96
00:07:34,518 --> 00:07:38,216
the only accident here
Is that Clark saved your life.

97
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:52,217
It's Lois Lane, L-A-N-E.

98
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,686
Lane!

99
00:07:54,721 --> 00:07:56,677
No time for chitchat,
chasing a lead.

100
00:07:56,763 --> 00:08:00,913
If you were on point, you wouldn't have let
the Ledger scoop you on the Davenport story.

101
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:03,588
Why don't you head o to the set
and sniff out a scandal.

102
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:07,598
News flash. White-collar crime
is this season's Hollywood D.U.I.

103
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:11,678
LuthorCorp recently purchased
100 acres of land...

104
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:15,143
A mile from the dam where Lex's
was building his toy soldiers.

105
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,042
And I'm stifling my yawn because?

106
00:08:18,135 --> 00:08:22,803
Because it's not one of Lex's
"Look at me, I've changed" stories.

107
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:25,091
This fiction should come with nodoz.

108
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:27,824
Besides, orphanages, hospitals...

109
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,552
nobody goes to bed Satan
and wakes up Oprah.

110
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:32,017
It's a front.

111
00:08:32,052 --> 00:08:34,440
Yore new here, so maybe
you didn't read the memo, but...

112
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:36,615
you need proof to write a story.

113
00:08:36,871 --> 00:08:39,370
There's nothing on the property
except a lone cabin...

114
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:41,302
And a bunch of "danger
no trespassing" signs.

115
00:08:41,357 --> 00:08:44,635
Do yourself a favor, Lane.
Drop the lead.

116
00:09:18,908 --> 00:09:20,846
You decided to join us.

117
00:09:26,939 --> 00:09:28,433
Water.

118
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:31,525
Oh, of course.
You must be parched.

119
00:09:57,638 --> 00:09:59,248
Where am I?

120
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,139
Who are you?

121
00:10:01,663 --> 00:10:03,190
I'm Marilyn.

122
00:10:07,394 --> 00:10:10,254
Why haven't you taken me
to a hospital, Marilyn?

123
00:10:12,925 --> 00:10:14,426
Wow.

124
00:10:14,609 --> 00:10:17,986
Not even a "thank you" before
you start asking for silk sheets.

125
00:10:19,956 --> 00:10:22,205
Aah! What is...

126
00:10:23,564 --> 00:10:24,836
I...

127
00:10:29,585 --> 00:10:31,262
What the hell is this?

128
00:10:37,371 --> 00:10:39,170
You unlock it, Marilyn.

129
00:10:40,384 --> 00:10:42,519
You know I can't run that risk.

130
00:10:42,732 --> 00:10:44,852
Not even for Lionel Luthor.

131
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,960
They're gonna find me, Marilyn.

132
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:52,746
It's only a matter of time, you know.

133
00:10:53,258 --> 00:10:56,032
As far as I know, there's
not a lot of people looking.

134
00:10:57,242 --> 00:10:59,911
Maybe it's time
you found some better friends.

135
00:11:24,539 --> 00:11:27,895
It's Marilyn.
He's finally awake.

136
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:40,733
Tell me the truth. Are you
different than other men?

137
00:11:41,938 --> 00:11:44,002
How can you ask me that?
You barely know me.

138
00:11:45,406 --> 00:11:48,298
I know you enough to see you walk
around with a secret so powerful...

139
00:11:48,903 --> 00:11:50,938
It won't let you close to anyone.

140
00:11:51,573 --> 00:11:55,465
"You should be with someone who
can give you the love you deserve. "

141
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:57,348
"You are that someone.”

142
00:11:57,481 --> 00:11:59,272
But you want to lie and run away. Why?

143
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:03,712
Um, uh, "Penelope, if I ever hurt you...

144
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:05,956
You can't hurt me if you love me.

145
00:12:06,744 --> 00:12:07,586
What?

146
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,318
It's okay. It's part of t scene.

147
00:12:10,565 --> 00:12:13,029
Yeah, but I have a...

148
00:12:13,124 --> 00:12:14,760
Girlfriend?

149
00:12:16,085 --> 00:12:17,912
Lana.

150
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:23,508
Rehearsing lines.
This is, um...

151
00:12:23,794 --> 00:12:24,716
Rachel.

152
00:12:24,864 --> 00:12:26,756
I know, I'm Lana.
Hi.

153
00:12:26,781 --> 00:12:28,046
Hi.

154
00:12:30,257 --> 00:12:32,525
I hope that Clark saved some of
those lines to rehearse with me later.

155
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:39,512
You know what?
I'm gonna go to the kitchen,

156
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:41,949
Have some cookies,
and drink whole milk.

157
00:12:49,468 --> 00:12:51,646
I didn't realize that Rachel
was actually staying here.

158
00:12:51,747 --> 00:12:54,950
I figured the farm was more off the radar.
No one would look for her here.

159
00:12:56,477 --> 00:12:58,116
Well, I didn't want to freak her out,

160
00:12:58,168 --> 00:13:00,981
but Chloe might have found
a clue about the attacker.

161
00:13:01,105 --> 00:13:04,147
She got sidetracked by her editor,
but she e-mailed us this.

162
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:08,102
Warrior Angel... Internet blogs?

163
00:13:08,433 --> 00:13:12,527
Turns out that not all the fans are
enthusiastic about the film's interpretation.

164
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:16,630
The movie stays true to the
mythology in all ways but one.

165
00:13:17,075 --> 00:13:20,760
In the comics,
Warrior Angel's girlfriend dies.

166
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,820
And in the movie, she doesn't.

167
00:13:25,186 --> 00:13:29,333
Blogs, message boards, fan forums...
these are al pretty extreme.

168
00:13:29,465 --> 00:13:32,207
How are we supposed to narrow this down
to the one psycho who's willing to kill?

169
00:13:32,297 --> 00:13:35,939
There's one poster, Devilicus Rebel,
who's becoming more and more aggressive.

170
00:13:36,003 --> 00:13:38,447
"When will Davenport learn
our hero lives in solitude?"

171
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,630
Her blood will unleash the truth.

172
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:51,732
Grew up on a farm with two dogs,
Only child, home-schooled.

173
00:13:51,991 --> 00:13:54,720
Looks like our 19-year-old from
Minnesota keeps a flawless record.

174
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,207
Keep searching.

175
00:14:01,284 --> 00:14:03,620
I just read about your heroics
in the paper.

176
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,125
Who needs Warrior Angel when
we've got our own Clark Kent?

177
00:14:09,212 --> 00:14:10,754
Actually, that's why I'm here.

178
00:14:11,134 --> 00:14:13,076
I was wondering if you could
help me with a reference.

179
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,200
You're the biggest
Warrior Angel fan I know.

180
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,807
Was a fan.

181
00:14:16,914 --> 00:14:19,167
I haven't picked up a comic
since we were friends.

182
00:14:19,581 --> 00:14:21,574
Back when I saw life
as black and white.

183
00:14:22,878 --> 00:14:26,935
When I realized good and evil was
gray, the stories lost their magic.

184
00:14:28,365 --> 00:14:33,102
Though I have to admit, yours is the
last nose I'd expect to find in a comic.

185
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:35,424
Someone wants Rachel Davenport
out of the movie.

186
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:38,449
This could be a clue
to the next attack.

187
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:43,267
"A hero in solitude."

188
00:14:47,297 --> 00:14:49,062
Issue number 5.

189
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:00,823
One of my favorites.

190
00:15:02,429 --> 00:15:05,559
It's the first time the archrival
Devilicus gets the upper hand.

191
00:15:06,885 --> 00:15:09,174
Warrior Angel's girlfriend
gets in over her head.

192
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:12,710
In trying to expose
Devilicus' darkness,

193
00:15:12,957 --> 00:15:15,370
She goes face to face with one
of the most powerful villains...

194
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:17,503
in the fantasy comics Universe.

195
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:22,099
So Devilicus does something
no reader sees coming.

196
00:15:23,143 --> 00:15:24,885
He shoots her.

197
00:15:26,318 --> 00:15:27,913
Warrior Angel
can't get there in time,

198
00:15:29,182 --> 00:15:31,467
And she dies in his arms.

199
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,306
I read the script.

200
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:39,579
In the movie version,
Warrior Angel saves his girlfriend's life.

201
00:15:40,534 --> 00:15:42,602
Sounds like Hollywood
went for the happy ending.

202
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:45,845
In the comic-book world,

203
00:15:45,947 --> 00:15:48,554
when you're destined
to save mankind,

204
00:15:49,271 --> 00:15:51,335
You're destined to be alone.

205
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:20,417
Here you are, sir.
Locked, loaded and ready to go.

206
00:16:20,452 --> 00:16:21,783
Thanks.

207
00:16:50,569 --> 00:16:52,331
We're rolling.

208
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,456
Rolling!

209
00:16:55,463 --> 00:16:57,431
Sounds bit.

210
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:59,987
Right on the set.

211
00:17:03,098 --> 00:17:03,985
And...

212
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:05,321
action.

213
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,534
You'll never live to expose me.

214
00:17:12,748 --> 00:17:14,791
If it's not me, it'll be someone else.

215
00:17:15,582 --> 00:17:17,754
Sooner or later, you'll be seen
for who you really are.

216
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:27,864
Cut!

217
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,845
Ok, that was great.

218
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:32,364
Moving on, extra.

219
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,020
Nice catch.

220
00:17:54,763 --> 00:17:56,835
Superhero.

221
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,331
Wow, I am really good at this.

222
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:38,600
Remind me to change my locks.

223
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:40,266
Lex.

224
00:18:40,696 --> 00:18:42,974
I thought you were being honored
by the green cross tonight.

225
00:18:48,986 --> 00:18:50,907
Where did you get this?

226
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,469
You know, Lois,

227
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:00,068
journalists have spent the last
decade unearthing my life,

228
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:03,155
turning whatever dirt they can
find into bad headline puns.

229
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,816
Do you really think you're different?

230
00:19:08,489 --> 00:19:10,791
I don't have any secrets left.

231
00:19:16,991 --> 00:19:19,644
It's not a secret that
you purchased land by the dam...

232
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,722
where you were conducting
illegal experiments?

233
00:19:22,112 --> 00:19:25,352
I never authorized the purchase
of any land by the dam.

234
00:19:26,407 --> 00:19:29,438
Well, not to be callous,

235
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:33,692
But with your dad MIA, there aren't a whole
lot of Luthors around these days with...

236
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:36,207
authorization privileges.

237
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:43,593
Mr. Luthor?

238
00:19:43,728 --> 00:19:45,588
Escort her off the premises.

239
00:19:45,623 --> 00:19:46,873
Yes Sir.

240
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:17,389
Careful, Lionel.
We're not all millionaires.

241
00:21:18,179 --> 00:21:19,866
Look...

242
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:24,713
I was wrong earlier.

243
00:21:27,855 --> 00:21:29,952
I should thank you...

244
00:21:31,449 --> 00:21:33,798
for everything.

245
00:21:41,684 --> 00:21:43,421
To be honest,

246
00:21:43,893 --> 00:21:47,438
it's starting to get a little lonely all
the way out here in the middle of nowhere.

247
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:51,121
It's nice having company.

248
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:54,523
But I don't have time!

249
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:05,099
Here he comes.

250
00:22:06,808 --> 00:22:08,811
Clark, would you have a few minutes?

251
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,282
What's it like dating a Hollywood starlet?

252
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:14,825
Is it true that Rachel's staying
here at your farm?

253
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:17,370
Would you like to make comments?
How long have you been dating?

254
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:20,597
Are you an aspiring actor?
Do you have any future plans?

255
00:22:21,083 --> 00:22:24,534
Rachel, the sheriff said that he
wasn't able to come up with any more...

256
00:22:25,718 --> 00:22:27,209
leads.

257
00:22:30,053 --> 00:22:33,550
This place is surrounded by paparazzi.
What are you doing?

258
00:22:35,081 --> 00:22:39,642
More like undoing six hours in a body
harness and the stress of a death threat.

259
00:22:40,167 --> 00:22:42,233
Rachel, if the paparazzi found you,

260
00:22:42,246 --> 00:22:44,908
then the person who attacked you
knows you're here.

261
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,199
So much for de-stressing.

262
00:22:50,564 --> 00:22:53,020
- Can you excuse us, please?
- Sure.

263
00:22:58,046 --> 00:22:59,847
Can you hand me
that robe over there?

264
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,796
Yeah.

265
00:23:12,479 --> 00:23:14,428
Rachel, what's this?

266
00:23:15,009 --> 00:23:17,030
A messenger delivered it.

267
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,890
A Warrior Angel comic book?

268
00:23:28,088 --> 00:23:32,319
I SAW WHAT YOU DID. IT’S YOUR JOB
TO SAVE THE WORLD. SAVE IT.

269
00:23:32,729 --> 00:23:34,576
What's going on, Clark?

270
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:38,445
Let's go.

271
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:40,657
We're leaving now.
This place isn't safe anymore.

272
00:23:58,202 --> 00:24:00,286
It's you. Thank god.

273
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:06,549
How did he escape, Marilyn?

274
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,259
- I don't know.
- I'm not paying you to make mistakes.

275
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:19,352
Don't say a word.

276
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,375
Clark, hi.

277
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,513
Just watching a movie
with aunt Nell.

278
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,894
Of course, I'll pick up Rachel
as soon as I can. Okay.

279
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:53,777
Chloe, I'm glad you're still here.

280
00:24:53,828 --> 00:24:56,994
Yeah, well, overtime really
helps me resist all temptation...

281
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:59,092
to grace Jimmy's my space page.

282
00:24:59,728 --> 00:25:01,390
What's up?

283
00:25:01,877 --> 00:25:04,640
The fan stalking Rachel must
have seen me catch that bullet.

284
00:25:05,403 --> 00:25:07,305
He's the only one
who knew it was real.

285
00:25:07,823 --> 00:25:09,518
Now he thinks I'm a superhero.

286
00:25:09,573 --> 00:25:11,189
Oh, my god, Clark.

287
00:25:11,371 --> 00:25:14,430
This guys' blog gets, like,
10,000 hits a day.

288
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:18,551
One post, and all of a sudden you're
everybody's favorite Boy Wonder.

289
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:20,759
Can you track this Warrior Angel
Comic to its owner?

290
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,580
I'd be a pretty lame sidekick
if I couldn't.

291
00:25:23,826 --> 00:25:26,362
Ok, when I was scanning
all of those blogs,

292
00:25:26,424 --> 00:25:29,795
I came across the collector who
tracks the Warrior Angel comic sales.

293
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:31,815
Maybe he's registered this one.

294
00:25:37,472 --> 00:25:40,170
Here we go. Cosmic comics
In Metropolis...

295
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,766
sold one to a Ben Meyers
last week. 815 Vine street.

296
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:03,749
I knew you'd find me.

297
00:26:04,094 --> 00:26:06,107
Only a real hero would.

298
00:26:10,992 --> 00:26:13,003
You're the production assistant
from the movie.

299
00:26:13,218 --> 00:26:14,607
Where are you?

300
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,946
Oh, come on. If I told you that,
you'd never let me go.

301
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,045
You're behind the attacks,
aren't you?

302
00:26:19,672 --> 00:26:21,742
Warrior Angel was all I had.

303
00:26:23,301 --> 00:26:25,385
He gave me
something to believe in.

304
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:27,849
He gave me hope.

305
00:26:27,868 --> 00:26:30,107
Warrior Angel wouldn't try
to kill someone.

306
00:26:30,703 --> 00:26:32,322
You can't mess with
someone's idol.

307
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:34,826
That's exactly why nobody
believes in heroes anymore.

308
00:26:36,549 --> 00:26:38,532
Including you, Clark.

309
00:26:41,345 --> 00:26:42,929
And that's where I come in.

310
00:26:42,948 --> 00:26:46,043
Just like Devilicus
made warrior Angel stand up...

311
00:26:46,551 --> 00:26:48,804
and save the world.

312
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:52,856
You need help.

313
00:26:54,867 --> 00:26:57,442
You just don't know it yet.

314
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,133
Dad?

315
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:24,324
You're alive.

316
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,926
I never gave up on you.

317
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,031
Lex, why did you do this?

318
00:27:35,956 --> 00:27:38,048
But I see you've given up on me.

319
00:27:43,468 --> 00:27:45,574
Don't you make me pull the trigger.

320
00:27:48,571 --> 00:27:49,886
Easy.

321
00:27:51,486 --> 00:27:53,500
We can all be roes, Lex.

322
00:27:53,718 --> 00:27:55,784
Besides, I read about you Luthors.

323
00:27:56,198 --> 00:27:58,698
Lionel would rather stick around
and have his other wrist broke...

324
00:27:58,791 --> 00:28:00,911
Than be saved by you.

325
00:28:06,638 --> 00:28:08,117
Dad.

326
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,878
Dad!

327
00:28:10,125 --> 00:28:11,545
Dad!

328
00:28:37,318 --> 00:28:41,572
Lana, I'm sorry for what you saw
in Clark's loft.

329
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:43,767
Rehearsing lines?

330
00:28:46,277 --> 00:28:49,613
It's in his eyes. You are
the center of Clark's universe.

331
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:52,751
I've only seen love like that
once in my life.

332
00:28:52,907 --> 00:28:54,338
What happened?

333
00:28:55,147 --> 00:28:56,979
The director yelled "cut."

334
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,045
Updated call sheets.

335
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:03,649
Oh, God. I can't escape work
for three seconds?

336
00:29:03,862 --> 00:29:05,551
How d you find me?

337
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,227
Destiny.

338
00:29:07,618 --> 00:29:09,364
Ooh!

339
00:29:15,332 --> 00:29:16,653
Sorry, Lana.

340
00:29:16,685 --> 00:29:18,660
But there's a hero living among us,

341
00:29:18,746 --> 00:29:20,886
And there's only one way
He'll accept his calling.

342
00:29:21,273 --> 00:29:22,945
You need to die.

343
00:29:35,531 --> 00:29:38,480
What did you mean when you said
that he was trying to make you...

344
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:40,293
accept your destiny?

345
00:29:40,738 --> 00:29:42,484
I was supposed to
stand for something greater.

346
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:44,817
It was my job to save the world.

347
00:29:46,218 --> 00:29:48,605
He didn't think organic farmer
was a close second?

348
00:29:48,755 --> 00:29:51,820
This guy's delusional, Chloe.
You couldn't possibly agree with him.

349
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,236
Do you want to cue my editorial,
or do you want to help me find

350
00:29:54,330 --> 00:29:56,902
the guy who's gonna out you
in front of a thousand people?

351
00:29:58,651 --> 00:30:00,884
What about his hard drive?
It might help.

352
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:07,189
I think it's too rational.
I mean, if Ben is this fractured,

353
00:30:07,215 --> 00:30:09,620
we're gonna need to loosen
a few screws of our own.

354
00:30:09,873 --> 00:30:13,642
Approach his next move like someone who's
blurred the line between fiction and reality.

355
00:30:14,375 --> 00:30:15,900
So, let's think.

356
00:30:16,015 --> 00:30:19,233
If I'm Devilicus, what is the worst
possible thing I could do...

357
00:30:19,268 --> 00:30:22,132
to Warrior Angel
to make him accept his destiny?

358
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,727
Lana.

359
00:30:34,012 --> 00:30:36,063
- Let me go!
- I can't.

360
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,162
Don't you see?

361
00:30:40,816 --> 00:30:42,918
Clark was made for a greater glory.

362
00:30:43,754 --> 00:30:45,687
But until he gives up his own desires...

363
00:30:45,745 --> 00:30:48,937
And focuses on the rest of the world,
thousands of lives are a stake.

364
00:30:48,985 --> 00:30:50,404
And mine doesn't matter?

365
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:54,981
I know it's not easy being
a superhero's girlfriend, Lana.

366
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:59,963
But Clark has to face
his destiny alone.

367
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:02,728
And you're standing in the way.

368
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:08,182
Lana.

369
00:31:49,478 --> 00:31:51,076
This is crap.

370
00:31:51,172 --> 00:31:53,280
Are you reading it upside down?

371
00:31:53,315 --> 00:31:54,917
Lionel Luthor lives!

372
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:59,712
And he was found on LuthorCorp land that no
one in the company claims to have purchased.

373
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:02,607
Now, did Lex use my tip
to find his father,

374
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,459
or as he be keeping him there
all is time?

375
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:07,492
You went behind my back.

376
00:32:08,018 --> 00:32:10,185
The rules were,
stay away from the Luthors.

377
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:14,729
Careful, Grant. You're starting
to sound like you care about me.

378
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:17,674
More like annoyed...

379
00:32:17,921 --> 00:32:20,022
that I'll have to baby-sit you
Friday night.

380
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:23,476
The Planet's being honored.
You're going with me to accept.

381
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,512
Tempting. I take notes and look pretty,

382
00:32:27,547 --> 00:32:30,585
you get to sit at the bar and
schmooze with all the important people.

383
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:32,928
I was thinking
more along the lines of,

384
00:32:32,989 --> 00:32:35,585
you getting some face time
with the who's who of Metropolis...

385
00:32:35,973 --> 00:32:39,404
and rescuing me
from some long-winded speeches.

386
00:32:40,256 --> 00:32:43,472
- You asking me on a date?
- God, no. I'm your boss.

387
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:46,881
You know what? That's it.
You're fired from being my plus one.

388
00:32:47,707 --> 00:32:50,260
You can't fire me.
I never accepted.

389
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:52,767
Here.

390
00:32:53,776 --> 00:32:56,814
Something tells me you don't want
to be scooped again by the Ledger.

391
00:32:59,584 --> 00:33:01,530
Oh, and for the record,

392
00:33:02,321 --> 00:33:04,433
If I had been your plus one,

393
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,069
You would have been
my arm candy.

394
00:33:23,963 --> 00:33:26,004
Lex told me you're living here now.

395
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:31,300
Well, you haven't wasted
much time...

396
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:34,513
getting back to your roots,
have you?

397
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,328
Lionel, I heard what happened.

398
00:33:36,699 --> 00:33:38,255
Are you okay?

399
00:33:39,222 --> 00:33:43,022
It's hardly reassuring
to read your own obituary, but...

400
00:33:43,874 --> 00:33:46,750
you should know that,
I suppose, shouldn't you?

401
00:33:47,481 --> 00:33:50,816
They said that you were being
held captive by a crazy woman.

402
00:33:51,193 --> 00:33:53,040
Indeed I was.

403
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:54,880
You.

404
00:34:00,191 --> 00:34:03,415
I would never be involved
in something like that.

405
00:34:03,737 --> 00:34:04,896
Oh please.

406
00:34:04,984 --> 00:34:08,117
That line stopped working for you
the day you faked your own death.

407
00:34:08,406 --> 00:34:10,959
Lex filled me in on the details...

408
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:15,682
which leaves only one question unanswered.
How much does Clark know?

409
00:34:17,113 --> 00:34:20,992
I'm sure that he's thrilled
that you are alive and well.

410
00:34:22,391 --> 00:34:24,536
I'm sure that you have managed
to convince yourself...

411
00:34:24,577 --> 00:34:26,842
that you did everything
for the sake of Clark Kent.

412
00:34:29,015 --> 00:34:32,160
That your love could protect him
half a world away.

413
00:34:33,749 --> 00:34:36,717
Finding your body and
paying your captor seems...

414
00:34:36,846 --> 00:34:40,513
rather complicated from
a hotel in Shanghai.

415
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:45,901
You may have lost the Luthor name,

416
00:34:45,993 --> 00:34:49,830
But it's the Luthor instincts that
keep those claws of yours sharp.

417
00:34:56,656 --> 00:35:00,725
Lana, please listen to me.

418
00:35:01,586 --> 00:35:04,317
You are on the edge
of a dangerous precipice.

419
00:35:05,639 --> 00:35:09,385
You could easily tumble down
into someplace very dark...

420
00:35:10,173 --> 00:35:12,228
and very hard to escape.

421
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:18,313
I hope you don't plan on
spreading these lies to Clark.

422
00:35:22,014 --> 00:35:23,358
Lies?

423
00:35:23,493 --> 00:35:25,618
I don't believe
your good intentions.

424
00:35:25,691 --> 00:35:27,677
You're not trying to protect Clark.

425
00:35:27,793 --> 00:35:29,918
This is about retribution.

426
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:33,922
Let him go, Lana,
before it's too late.

427
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:05,498
Lex Luthor.

428
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:08,459
What are you doing here?

429
00:36:09,557 --> 00:36:11,700
I thought You might enjoy this.

430
00:36:15,712 --> 00:36:17,377
Here.

431
00:36:34,187 --> 00:36:37,209
These are rarest
Warrior Angel comics ever.

432
00:36:37,890 --> 00:36:39,861
They're worth a fortune.

433
00:36:46,973 --> 00:36:48,434
Why are you giving me this?

434
00:36:48,489 --> 00:36:50,211
Because I've been know
to believe in something...

435
00:36:50,225 --> 00:36:52,687
after the whole world
tells me I'm wrong.

436
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:57,385
Devilicus he said that exact line
to the president in issue...

437
00:36:57,468 --> 00:36:59,374
175.

438
00:37:02,402 --> 00:37:05,558
Ben, they dragged you in here
kicking and screaming...

439
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:10,234
Because you claimed you saw a man with
superpowers swipe a bullet out of thin air.

440
00:37:13,029 --> 00:37:15,107
I'm here to listen.

441
00:37:22,178 --> 00:37:24,228
There's nothing to say.

442
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:27,103
It was all in my head.

443
00:37:56,042 --> 00:37:58,092
Help, somebody!

444
00:37:59,624 --> 00:38:01,529
Got ya!

445
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:04,364
Did you ever consider
a career in acting?

446
00:38:05,856 --> 00:38:07,836
I wanted to say goodbye.

447
00:38:08,008 --> 00:38:10,183
But don't worry,
I'll be back for the sequel.

448
00:38:10,366 --> 00:38:11,865
What's this?

449
00:38:12,082 --> 00:38:16,180
Thanks... for showing me Smallville
had more to offer than a tax break.

450
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:19,345
It's a little something from the movie.
Every superhero needs one.

451
00:38:19,941 --> 00:38:23,713
I signed onto Warrior Angel
for publicity and a paycheck,

452
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:29,294
But after meeting you, I'm starting
to believe that heroes really do exist.

453
00:38:35,477 --> 00:38:37,743
There's something special
about this one, Lana.

454
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,311
Hold on to him.

455
00:38:43,686 --> 00:38:46,860
I sure hope that comment
about a sequel was a joke.

456
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:53,898
You okay?

457
00:38:54,884 --> 00:38:57,419
Just thinking about what Ben said.

458
00:38:57,616 --> 00:39:00,991
Oh, Lana, don't. Ben was...
a crazy fan...

459
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:03,797
who got locked up In Belle Reeve.

460
00:39:04,016 --> 00:39:05,758
He needed a hope,

461
00:39:05,783 --> 00:39:09,641
And he's not wrong. Millions of
people look up to Warrior Angel.

462
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:13,995
What if those people
could look up to you instead?

463
00:39:15,572 --> 00:39:18,266
Well, Lana, there's not even
a million people in Smallville.

464
00:39:22,269 --> 00:39:27,885
Clark, I just want to grab on
to you and never let you go...

465
00:39:29,689 --> 00:39:32,633
but one day the world
will need you more than I do,

466
00:39:33,492 --> 00:39:36,731
And I don't want to be
the one holding you here.

467
00:39:44,365 --> 00:39:46,325
I'm not going anywhere.

468
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:49,923
For the first time in my life,
I have everything I've ever wanted,

469
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:52,655
and it's right here on this farm with you.

470
00:40:02,698 --> 00:40:04,764
Okay.
