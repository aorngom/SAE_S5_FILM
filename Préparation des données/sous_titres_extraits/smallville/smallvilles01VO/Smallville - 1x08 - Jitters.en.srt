1
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,000
Son of a gun!

2
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,120
Don't use the upstairs bathroom. It's
backed up. I have to snake the pipes.

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,600
- Where's the leftover pizza?
- Fridge, second shelf.

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,440
Or you could nuke
the chili for dinner.

5
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:28,880
Clark?

6
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,920
Some clue you actually heard me.

7
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,880
Upstairs bathroom off-limits
after nuclear chili dinner.

8
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:39,000
Glad to see your hearing
hasn't changed.

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,680
Clark, can I get
a hand out here, please?

10
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,760
Son, would you...?

11
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
- Sure.
- Thanks.

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,360
Sure picked one heck of a day
to snap an exhaust hanger.

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,480
I left the number of our hotel on
the nightstand. I think that's everything.

14
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:06,000
That ought to do it.
I'm definitely raising your allowance.

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,760
- Lf you need anything...
- Call.

16
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,840
Mom, it's a couple of nights
in Metropolis. I'll be fine.

17
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,360
I'm sure he'll be fine.
And soon, madame, so shall we be.

18
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,120
I almost forgot.

19
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,640
Sorry.

20
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,560
Happy anniversary.

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,960
Sweetheart, bye-bye.

22
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:30,920
Clark, thanks for the card.

23
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,200
Think fast!

24
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,320
Good night, little one.

25
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
Don't worry.

26
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,120
Daddy's gonna get better.

27
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,960
Hello?

28
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,960
Is someone there?

29
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,720
It's okay, honey. It's just thunder.

30
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,200
Will!

31
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,520
Earl? What are you doing here?

32
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,960
I need to see Lionel Luthor.

33
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,280
- I know he's here.
- Sorry, man, you know I can't let you in.

34
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,200
They did something to me
at his plant in Smallville.

35
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,680
See, that's the talk that got
yourself canned, all right?

36
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:36,160
- Lf you've got a problem, get some help.
- I've tried. They can't do anything.

37
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,920
It's getting worse.

38
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,240
Please, let me in.

39
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,560
Earl, don't make me call security,
all right?

40
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,040
Just go home and dry off.

41
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,440
What the hell?

42
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,280
What the hell you doing, Earl?!

43
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,520
- Lf I don't get an answer, I'll die.
- No, we gotta get you to a doctor!

44
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:18,240
Look, they can't do anything.
Nobody can.

45
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
Jitters

46
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,400
What will you do now that you're
officially home alone?

47
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,640
I was thinking of having
a few people over.

48
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,720
Do my ears deceive me or is Clark Kent
actually suggesting a party?

49
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,640
Small gathering. You guys,
a few other people, maybe Lana.

50
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,520
With or without her posable
action-figure boyfriend?

51
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,320
Eight o'clock.

52
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,480
- And remember, the keyword is "small."
- Small.

53
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,320
So this is what you'd call
a small gathering, right?

54
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,000
Do you even recognize
half these people?

55
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,320
Watch the glass...

56
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,000
Dude, I think I'm gonna hurl.

57
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,800
Thanks.

58
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,800
Pretty cool party!

59
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,760
Lana. Thanks.

60
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,200
It's kind of impromptu.

61
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,280
Sometimes you just have to kick back
and blow off some steam.

62
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,760
If I had a hundred people trashing
my house, I'd be a little freaked out.

63
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,920
After the first few dishes,
you get used to it.

64
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,280
I don't think I'd be
brave enough to risk it.

65
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:34,200
I don't know, Lana.
I bet you're braver than you think.

66
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,800
You flying solo tonight?

67
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,440
You mean, what am I doing here
without Whitney?

68
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,600
I am capable of enjoying myself
without him.

69
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,000
Fireworks!

70
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,000
- You're full of surprises tonight, Clark.
- Tell me about it.

71
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,560
Clark, man, how cool is this?

72
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,120
Pete, why didn't you just call
the cops? Lt'd be easier.

73
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,480
I can't claim credit.
It wasn't my idea.

74
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,360
It was mine.

75
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,840
Call it a party gift.
I hope you like it.

76
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,960
- It's great, it's just...
- Forget the police. It's covered.

77
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,640
This kind of party can make
or break a reputation.

78
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,480
I wanted to make sure yours was a hit.

79
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,640
- I hear you're taking a tour of my plant.
- It's a class field trip.

80
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,640
- What'd you do wrong?
- It's that bad, huh?

81
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,360
Sorry I took so long.
Someone overflowed the bathroom.

82
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm officially dead.

83
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,640
There's no answer.

84
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,520
He's fine, he's fine.
We have to trust him, Martha.

85
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,720
- I do, but I still worry.
- I know.

86
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,240
Metropolis...

87
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,240
Do you...? Do you miss it?

88
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,120
Sometimes.

89
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,600
But I didn't move to Smallville
for action and glamour.

90
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:22,240
I moved because a certain man
told me we'd never be rich...

91
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,040
...or travel the world,
but he'd always love me.

92
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,120
How could I pass up
an offer like that?

93
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,560
- Whitney, what are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

94
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,360
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming here?

95
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,680
It was kind of last-minute. I didn't
realize I needed your permission.

96
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,240
Lana, can we talk outside?

97
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,640
Oh, my gosh! Did...?

98
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,840
Lana, what's going on?

99
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,240
I told you when we got back together
that I needed some breathing room.

100
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,600
So you sneak off to a party
without me?

101
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,800
I didn't sneak. I walked.

102
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,440
And why are you mad at me?

103
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,400
Is it because it's Clark's party?

104
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,600
I'm starting to get the feeling
that you don't trust me.

105
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,000
Clark!

106
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,360
You better get out here.

107
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,760
Kent, get up here.

108
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,600
- Got him!
- Earl.

109
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,040
Back off, I know him.

110
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,000
Earl, what are you doing here?

111
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,000
I came to see your dad.
He's the only one I can trust.

112
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,840
He's out of town.

113
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,800
What's wrong with you?

114
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,000
Call an ambulance.

115
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,960
- This guy should be in a detox center.
- He's not on drugs, Chloe.

116
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,160
Then why was he shaking like a junkie?

117
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,440
Earl worked on the farm
for six seasons.

118
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,720
I spent twelve hours a day
with the guy in the fields.

119
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:08,440
He even tried to teach me how to play
guitar. He says it impresses women.

120
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,880
We're all a sucker for a guy
with a six-string.

121
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,640
How come I've never heard you play?

122
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,200
I kept snapping the guitar strings.
I think Earl got sick of replacing them.

123
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,440
Just because you spend time
with someone...

124
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,720
...doesn't mean you know
their darkest secrets.

125
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,680
- He was like family.
- Then why'd he leave?

126
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,240
He took a job at the LuthorCorp plant.

127
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,560
It was full-time
and the pay was better.

128
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:40,360
- Where can we find Earl Jenkins?
- Exam Room 3, down the hall.

129
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:44,080
Excuse me. I'm a friend of Earl's.
Is he in some kind of trouble?

130
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,160
Oh, yeah.

131
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
We need help in here!

132
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,920
Earl!

133
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,120
Hi. You're home early.

134
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,760
We called six times last night,
spoke with six different people...

135
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,840
...none of whom knew who you were.

136
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,040
It was supposed to be
an intimate occasion.

137
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,560
- Clark, where have you been?
- The hospital.

138
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,280
- I'm never leaving home again.
- Who got hurt?

139
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,800
Nobody, but I found
Earl Jenkins hiding in the loft.

140
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,920
He was looking for you, Dad.
He's all messed up.

141
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:51,840
- What's the matter with Earl?
- I don't know. He's wanted for murder.

142
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,360
Earl?

143
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,640
What'd he say for himself?

144
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,080
- I couldn't get close.
- How come, the police?

145
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,320
No.

146
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,640
Because when I got near him,
I got sick.

147
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,640
It was weird.

148
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,640
Every time I stood next to him,
it got worse. It's kind of like...

149
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:12,120
Like what?

150
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:16,760
It's kind of like the way I feel
around meteor fragments.

151
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,440
What's wrong with him?

152
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,520
Well, to be honest,
I haven't the faintest idea.

153
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,040
It's amazing his body's been able
to survive the seizures this long.

154
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,720
Take a look at the x-rays.

155
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,960
It looks like mineral poisoning,
but it's not a mineral I've seen before.

156
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,760
Is that why he's shaking so hard?

157
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:53,040
Mineral fragments are embedded
under his skin.

158
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,440
- His body is trying to push them out.
- How did they get there?

159
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:00,200
He claims there was an explosion
at the LuthorCorp plant six months ago.

160
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,320
- I didn't hear about that.
- That's because it didn't happen.

161
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:08,480
I pulled the plant's safety records.
I checked with OSHA and the EPA.

162
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,160
- Can I go in and talk to him by myself?
- Better hurry up.

163
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,000
Metropolis P.D. Will be here any minute
to transfer him back to the city.

164
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,600
Thanks.

165
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,680
- I wanna go with you.
- No.

166
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,280
Listen, you said that you felt sick
when you got around him, right?

167
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,640
I bet what he was exposed to
has to do with those meteor rocks.

168
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,720
I don't want you passing out
around here.

169
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,200
It'd bring us a whole other set
of problems.

170
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,680
Jonathan.

171
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,240
Am I glad to see you.

172
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,120
Hey, look.

173
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,360
Clark.
Can you hear me?

174
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,280
I'm sorry. I didn’t mean to...

175
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,720
I'm fine. Don 't worry about it.

176
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,640
All right, Earl, what's going on?
I can't believe you'd wanna kill anybody.

177
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,360
It was an accident.
I was trying to see Lionel Luthor.

178
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:26,480
- Why?
- Find out what they used on Level 3.

179
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,920
Earl, you're not making any sense.

180
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,480
When I got that job
at the Smallville plant...

181
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,240
...I was assigned to clean Level 3.

182
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,960
They were doing these
hush-hush crop experiments.

183
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,520
A new kind of fertilizer supposed
to make corn grow twice as fast.

184
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:48,280
There was something unstable
in that fertilizer.

185
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,760
There was a huge explosion.
I was cleaning at the time.

186
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,520
This stuff, it got under my skin.

187
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,720
And the next thing I know...

188
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,520
...they shut it all down
and I was transferred to Metropolis.

189
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,440
Then two months ago,
the jitters started.

190
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,760
- Did you see a doctor?
- I must have seen 50.

191
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,040
But nobody could tell me
what was wrong.

192
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,720
They needed to know
what I was exposed to.

193
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:18,520
But when I went back to the plant,
they told me that Level 3 didn't exist.

194
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,000
That it never had.

195
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,440
I got to find out what they were using.
That's why I need your help.

196
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,520
You gotta get me out of here.

197
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:30,360
Earl, you're wanted for murder.

198
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:34,440
You don't understand. I can't control it.
I'm running out of time.

199
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,960
The jitters are getting worse.

200
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:42,200
It's already cost me my job,
my marriage, my baby.

201
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,160
I gotta get back into that plant,
or I'm gonna die.

202
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,360
Help me.

203
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,440
You get some rest, Earl.

204
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,600
My baby.

205
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,960
- Do you think he's telling the truth?
- I have no idea.

206
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,080
I have a field trip to LuthorCorp today.
Maybe I could look around.

207
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,800
I know you're worried, but Earl has
more trouble than he can handle.

208
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,800
And I don 't even know if he's in his right
mind. So, please, don 't do anything.

209
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,160
Mommy, I don't wanna go to the doctor's.
They're gonna give me a shot.

210
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:51,080
- They're not gonna give you a shot.
- That's what you said last time.

211
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,040
Mommy!

212
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,760
Hello, everybody, I'm Gabe Sullivan,
plant manager and proud father.

213
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,760
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, Dad.

214
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,200
Welcome to LuthorCorp:
"Where we give a crap."

215
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,920
Okay, somebody kill me now.

216
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:23,160
Little fertilizer humour there.

217
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,440
Before we go inside...

218
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,560
...I need you to remove all
your cell phones, pagers, jewellery.

219
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:32,000
Anything that jangles, dangles or rings
has to go in these plastic trays.

220
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Any other questions?
Yes.

221
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,120
I heard there was a third level
to the plant. Is that true?

222
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,680
That's where we do
the alien autopsies.

223
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,600
- I think we'd better get started.
- Don't encourage him.

224
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,520
This way, everybody.

225
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,640
All right, people,
let's stay together.

226
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,440
No. No. No!

227
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,560
This can't be. This can't be.
This can't be.

228
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,000
This can't be happening.

229
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,360
Where is it?

230
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,680
Where is it?

231
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,520
Where's the elevator?

232
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:44,840
Watch out for these babies.
260 degrees, they get hot.

233
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,760
All right, stay together, please.

234
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,320
This is it.
The plant's mission control.

235
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,480
100,000 tons of animal waste
to process here every year.

236
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,400
Trust me.
The results can be pretty explosive.

237
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:13,960
So if any of you had beans for lunch,
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

238
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:17,040
Among his peers,
he's considered witty.

239
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,800
Where's Clark?

240
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,400
What the heck?

241
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,000
Excuse me.

242
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,680
Don't move!

243
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,440
Take me to Level 3.

244
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:39,800
- Dad.
- Now!

245
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,440
When we send our kids
on a field trip...

246
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,280
...we'd like to believe
that they're gonna be safe.

247
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,920
Lex Luthor!

248
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,960
Let these two in, just these two.

249
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,800
We'll check on
Derrick and Jeff for you.

250
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,120
What's going on here?

251
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,960
There's a lunatic inside demanding to
be taken to some place called Level 3.

252
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,120
We've evacuated the plant,
but he's taken the students hostage.

253
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,720
- Is anyone hurt?
- Not yet.

254
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,880
- What's his name?
- Earl Jenkins.

255
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:27,560
I know Earl Jenkins.
He used to work for us.

256
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,080
Well, what's he doing in my plant?

257
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,880
He claims that LuthorCorp is doing
some crop experiments...

258
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:36,480
...on some secret Level 3,
and that's what made him sick.

259
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,720
He's convinced it's the only place
he can get a cure.

260
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:43,640
We've got a serious problem,
because there is no Level 3.

261
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,200
Where's Clark?

262
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,400
I swear, I don't know anything
about Level 3.

263
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,360
- You're lying.
- He's not lying!

264
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,760
I found these blueprints.
There is no Level 3.

265
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:49,200
Every night, I go down to Level 2...

266
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,080
...follow the red pipes
down that long hallway...

267
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,360
...go to the door, I open it...

268
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:00,760
...and I take the elevator down
to Level 3!

269
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,160
You're just like everybody else.

270
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,360
Get over there and you sit down!

271
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,280
Who's that?

272
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,800
My father.

273
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,520
- Mr. Luthor, we have a hostage situation.
- I was briefed on my way down.

274
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,160
Lex!

275
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,360
- How did you allow this to happen?
- I didn't allow...

276
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,680
- Then how did this man get inside?
- I think...

277
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,680
- You think? Why don't you know?
- Can we focus on what's important?

278
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:03,160
- We've got innocent kids in there.
- This is Jonathan Kent.

279
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,640
It's been a long time,
but I never forget a face.

280
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,560
Kent's son is inside.
They know the gunman personally.

281
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,960
What's your assessment
of this lunatic?

282
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,840
He's sick, he's desperate...

283
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,120
...and he blames your plant
for his condition.

284
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,560
This Level 3 nonsense...

285
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,760
I've assured everyone there is
no Level 3. That is the truth, isn't it?

286
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,680
Of course, it is.

287
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,880
People's lives are at stake.
What will you do about it?

288
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,320
I'm going to let SWAT
do their job.

289
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,360
When he makes a mistake,
they'll move in.

290
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,360
What about the kids?

291
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,240
You need to get on the phone
and talk to him!

292
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,960
Mrs. Kent, I understand how you feel.

293
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,640
I want everyone to walk out
of there alive too.

294
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:52,640
- But I do not negotiate with terrorists.
- He's not a terrorist!

295
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
He's sick and he needs help!

296
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,400
If you won't talk to him,
then Jonathan will!

297
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,760
You're not the one he blames.

298
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,640
Is he, Dad?

299
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,520
Gabe, it's Luthor.

300
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,560
Lionel Luthor.

301
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,120
Speaker.

302
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,360
Mr. Luthor.

303
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,720
I've finally got your attention,
haven't I?

304
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,000
Earl, why don't you come out?
We've got a lot to talk about.

305
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,480
Just tell me what you were
using down on Level 3.

306
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,280
You're sick, Earl.

307
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,640
Let everyone go,
we'll get you help.

308
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,760
- Clark!
- Are you okay?

309
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,440
Oh, no.

310
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:57,000
See what you made me do?
See what you made me...?

311
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,160
See what you made me do?

312
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,080
Way to go, Dad.
I see you haven't lost your touch.

313
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:12,520
The methane gas valve just broke.
The whole place is gonna go up.

314
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,320
- We need to do something.
- That's not a good idea.

315
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:20,040
The man's nuts. He's not listening
to the cops, and that gas is gonna blow.

316
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,360
- He's sick, but still strong.
- I don't want you to get hurt.

317
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,360
I'm not putting my life
in that man's hands.

318
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,800
The two of us can take him.
How about it, Clark?

319
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:34,720
I can't.

320
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,720
It's okay.

321
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:49,600
I trusted you. You told me you
were trying to help people.

322
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,480
What are you doing?

323
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,000
Get back!

324
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
It's all your fault, Luthor.

325
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,520
We've got shots fired,
one hostage down. Full alert.

326
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,720
What was he thinking?

327
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,280
He's a teenager who's been waiting
for someone to take the initiative.

328
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,840
There's a hostage situation
and a potential bomb.

329
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,680
- Somebody's gotta do something.
- You're right. I'm going in.

330
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,520
Lex, don't be foolhardy.
This is no time for mock-heroics.

331
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,960
You said this is my plant.
It's my call.

332
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,400
I won't allow it, Lex.

333
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,760
Don't ever do that again.

334
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,240
Take your positions.

335
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,400
Tell him Lex Luthor's coming
to see him.

336
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,240
- I wouldn't advise that, sir.
- Make the call.

337
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,120
Give me your vest.

338
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:54,120
What kind of man sends his own kid
to do his dirty work?

339
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:58,920
I'm not doing anybody's dirty work.
This is my plant.

340
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,440
- How is he?
- He needs a doctor.

341
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,640
What are we gonna do
about these kids, Earl?

342
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,440
I never meant to hurt anybody.

343
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,640
I tried talking to your father,
but he wouldn't listen to me.

344
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
I know the feeling.

345
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,040
Earl...

346
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,320
...you say that everybody's
been lying to you.

347
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,840
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

348
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,320
My father doesn't care about you.

349
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:35,720
He doesn't care about anybody
in this room.

350
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,640
Because if we all die,
his PR firm will spin it.

351
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,000
His insurance company will pay
and you will go down as the bad guy.

352
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,800
I'm not the bad guy.
I'm just trying to get better.

353
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,080
How are you gonna get better
by killing a bunch of kids?

354
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:57,320
If you let everybody go,
I'll take you to Level 3.

355
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,760
You stop lying.

356
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,240
Let them go,
and I'll show you where it is.

357
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,840
Earl, trust me. I'm a man of my word.

358
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,240
Get out.

359
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,520
Get out. Get out! Everybody, get out!

360
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,600
- Do you really know where it is?
- Yeah, it's in his imagination.

361
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:35,000
There is no Level 3, Clark.
Now, get out of here.

362
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,560
Clark.

363
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,080
Come on.
Come on, man, let's go!

364
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,640
- Come on, keep moving!
- This way, kids. This way.

365
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,520
The kids are coming out.

366
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:56,200
- Oh, Jonathan!
- Come on. They'll come out over here.

367
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,640
We need to bring down the fire doors.
The gas levels are too high.

368
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,400
Your son will be sealed inside.
I'm sorry, sir.

369
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,120
Do it.

370
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:18,400
- Come on, man, we gotta go!
- Don't worry about me!

371
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,480
- Pete.
- Whitney, did you see Clark?

372
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:31,040
Hey, Pete.
Where's Clark?

373
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,840
He's back inside, Mrs. Kent.
I tried to stop him. I'm sorry...

374
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,440
You have to open the doors.

375
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,080
They're safety locked and can't be
opened until the gas levels go down.

376
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,760
My son is still in there!

377
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,960
So is mine.

378
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,080
We're running out of time.

379
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,960
All right, I've done my part.
Now it's time for you to do yours.

380
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,880
Earl, there is no Level 3.
It's all in your head.

381
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,160
I should have never trusted you.
You Luthors are all the same.

382
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,440
I found Level 3. They built a wall in front
of the elevator, but it's still here.

383
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,160
- Stop playing with me!
- Get out of the building, Clark!

384
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,400
Earl, it's here!
Don 't you want to see it? I promise.

385
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,000
Come on, I want you to see the truth.

386
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,520
Come on.

387
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,760
Come on, come on!

388
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,720
- Sir.
- Hold on.

389
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:22,640
The gas pressure is beginning to drop.

390
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,360
- How did that happen?
- I have no idea.

391
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:38,280
Son of a bitch!
How do you explain that?

392
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,400
I can't.

393
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:58,760
Two buttons. Two levels.
I'm sorry, all right?

394
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,280
I told you it was here.

395
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,600
Where is it?

396
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,080
Where is everything?
There used to be a...

397
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:38,440
It was a field of corn
with sprayers all over it.

398
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,800
And every night,
they'd spray this green mist on it.

399
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,880
What have you done with it?

400
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,640
What have you done with it?!

401
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,040
I don't know.

402
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,360
They lied to me too, Earl.

403
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,440
I had no idea this was here.

404
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,320
Earl!

405
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:00,800
Let's go back upstairs
and talk about this.

406
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,120
It's all gone. How am I gonna get better
if I don't know what poisoned me?

407
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:09,640
I didn't know about this place.
You gotta believe me.

408
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:13,600
- I believe you, Lex.
- He's lying! He's just like his father!

409
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:37,720
Clark!

410
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:54,200
No! Oh, God!

411
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,080
Clark!

412
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,720
Get to the elevator!

413
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,360
Clark, how did you pull us up?

414
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,800
I don't know.

415
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,960
Adrenaline, I guess.

416
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:58,640
I've never been so happy
to see you in my life!

417
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,120
- You lied to me.
- No. When?

418
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:07,480
I said Level 3 wasn't on any plans.
It wasn't.

419
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,760
- It's plausible deniability.
- What were you doing down there?

420
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:14,760
It doesn't matter. It was a failure.
We closed the door and moved on.

421
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,480
- You almost got me killed.
- No, you almost got yourself killed.

422
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,440
It was your call, remember?

423
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,240
- Mr. Luthor!
- I'll handle this.

424
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,240
What can you tell us about Level 3?

425
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:29,440
I think you're referring to a redundant
storage area at the base of the plant.

426
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,520
Mr. Jenkins is a very sick man who
desperately needs medical attention.

427
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,600
That's why my father
and I have pledged...

428
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:39,920
...to find Mr. Jenkins
the best medical care possible.

429
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,600
He was a LuthorCorp employee.

430
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,960
Here at LuthorCorp, we always put
family first. Isn't that right, Dad?

431
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:50,000
Is it true the government is
going to shut you down?

432
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:54,800
No more questions, please. My son
has been through quite an ordeal today.

433
