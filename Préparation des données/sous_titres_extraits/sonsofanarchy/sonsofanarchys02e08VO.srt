00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:02,943
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:03,068 --> 00:00:03,822
Shit!

3
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:10,301
You really got 400 thou
stashed away, Chucky?

4
00:00:10,426 --> 00:00:13,406
Lin was real sloppy with his money,
so I cooked his books for about a year.

5
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:15,976
- The hand on the dick, what's the deal?
- I have this condition.

6
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:17,851
I'm not even aware of it.

7
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,939
I want to talk to Lin.
I'll throw in the door prize.

8
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:24,774
I do not accept this!

9
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:26,025
Ethan Zobelle.

10
00:00:26,193 --> 00:00:27,735
Cammy Hayes. My boy, Edmond.

11
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:31,197
- Glad we finally get to meet in person.
- Someplace private we can talk?

12
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:33,658
Why don't you keep me company?

13
00:00:33,827 --> 00:00:36,202
Otto says some guy's
giving you trouble.

14
00:00:36,543 --> 00:00:39,163
Shitbag's threatening my girls
they don't join his company.

15
00:00:39,404 --> 00:00:42,630
- Wait a minute, hang onto that.
- Look what that asshole did to her.

16
00:00:42,755 --> 00:00:44,710
- This was Caruso?
- Who do you think?!

17
00:00:45,069 --> 00:00:46,069
Georgie!

18
00:00:47,018 --> 00:00:48,756
Get the hell out!
This is a closed set!

19
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:54,075
Shit!

20
00:00:54,513 --> 00:00:57,431
Think they know where Zobelle is.
Christian Center, Morada.

21
00:00:57,599 --> 00:00:59,449
AKs and shotguns. Let's go.

22
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:10,027
We got to get the hell out of here.
Out!

23
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:11,715
Drop the guns, now!

24
00:01:17,063 --> 00:01:18,494
No, they need this.

25
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,558
I finished it.

26
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:49,578
What do you want me to say?

27
00:01:51,453 --> 00:01:53,885
Keep saying
you want to change things.

28
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:56,838
But you keep repeating old behavior.

29
00:01:58,203 --> 00:01:59,903
Can't have it both ways.

30
00:02:03,826 --> 00:02:05,626
Is there anything you love

31
00:02:06,178 --> 00:02:09,274
so much,
you'd protect it no matter the cost?

32
00:02:10,515 --> 00:02:12,265
The damage it did to you?

33
00:02:13,486 --> 00:02:14,686
Yeah, a child.

34
00:02:16,327 --> 00:02:18,527
That's how I feel about this club.

35
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,750
Since I was five, all I ever wanted
was a Harley and a cut.

36
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:30,058
Look, change won't happen quick.

37
00:02:31,796 --> 00:02:33,146
Or without blood.

38
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:36,602
But it'll happen.

39
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:39,613
It has to.

40
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,860
See you later.

41
00:03:14,947 --> 00:03:16,347
You get any sleep?

42
00:03:19,302 --> 00:03:20,302
Not much.

43
00:03:22,425 --> 00:03:24,787
- That fight with Jax...
- It's my problem.

44
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:27,731
Donna?

45
00:03:30,044 --> 00:03:31,394
Don't matter why.

46
00:03:32,516 --> 00:03:33,716
Had to happen.

47
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,541
- What?
- Him challenging me.

48
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:41,354
It's in his DNA.

49
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,930
Maybe you're right.

50
00:03:47,173 --> 00:03:49,373
Ghost of his old man haunting him.

51
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:01,031
And how does that play out?

52
00:04:03,544 --> 00:04:05,194
I guess we'll find out.

53
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:11,173
I want to do a dinner tonight.
Everyone.

54
00:04:12,481 --> 00:04:14,795
- It's not a good time.
- It's the perfect time.

55
00:04:15,763 --> 00:04:16,813
We need it.

56
00:04:18,488 --> 00:04:20,038
Do what you gotta do.

57
00:04:28,732 --> 00:04:30,482
What did you tell Stahl?

58
00:04:30,607 --> 00:04:32,605
- There's nothing to tell.
- Bullshit!

59
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,427
ATF's looking into Zobelle
and the Irish.

60
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:37,120
She's not digging into Sam Crow.

61
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:39,695
She's doing her job.
She wants the supplier.

62
00:04:40,497 --> 00:04:43,597
I got no delusions
about us being on the same side.

63
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,167
But we both know that Zobelle

64
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:49,117
and this ATF bitch
are bad for Charming.

65
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,039
You were right.

66
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:52,958
Zobelle doesn't make mistakes.

67
00:04:54,758 --> 00:04:56,008
He's protected.

68
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,639
My god.

69
00:04:59,105 --> 00:05:00,799
ATF can't touch the league.

70
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:03,167
FBI's looking into white hate.

71
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,042
Right.

72
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:07,304
That's why Stahl needs us.

73
00:05:07,667 --> 00:05:09,308
Now why would the feds need you?

74
00:05:09,594 --> 00:05:12,813
Sons just being mechanics and all.

75
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:16,457
Big picture, deputy. Look at it.

76
00:05:20,604 --> 00:05:22,668
It's a little bit painful
when I ride.

77
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:24,893
Sometimes I feel it when I walk.

78
00:05:25,353 --> 00:05:27,517
Other than that, back to normal.

79
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:28,642
Is it gay

80
00:05:29,107 --> 00:05:31,607
- that I want to see it?
- Gay curious.

81
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:33,317
Come on, drop 'em.

82
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:37,556
Show time.

83
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:42,967
Is it supposed to be that swollen?

84
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,370
Think so.

85
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:46,220
They look uneven.

86
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:48,354
One nut's always bigger
than the other one.

87
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,479
Really?

88
00:05:50,764 --> 00:05:52,935
I think mine are equally huge, man.

89
00:05:53,999 --> 00:05:55,646
I shouldn't have to see that.

90
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,881
- The new ball.
- I gather.

91
00:06:00,364 --> 00:06:01,364
Congrats.

92
00:06:09,293 --> 00:06:10,119
What's up?

93
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:14,167
We need to take a look
at this thing with Clay and Jax.

94
00:06:14,292 --> 00:06:15,856
Heard they got into it at county.

95
00:06:15,981 --> 00:06:17,416
It was brutal, man.

96
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,591
Shit's been brewing for months.

97
00:06:20,332 --> 00:06:21,432
Since Donna.

98
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:26,385
You think Donna's death's
got something to do with their beef?

99
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,430
Started way before.

100
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:31,598
What do you think
they're fighting about?

101
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,107
Jax pushing for change.

102
00:06:33,232 --> 00:06:36,832
That kind of beef is good for this club.
It keeps us current.

103
00:06:37,092 --> 00:06:39,773
What's going on between them
is much uglier.

104
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:41,942
And if it keeps going,
it going to hurt us,

105
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,422
worse than Zobelle and the ATF.

106
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,855
We got to dig into them.

107
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:51,408
- We got to get to the truth.
- I can talk to Jax.

108
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,480
You two been bumping heads.

109
00:06:53,917 --> 00:06:55,117
He'll tell me.

110
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,120
He knows I want to help.

111
00:06:57,593 --> 00:06:58,593
All right.

112
00:06:59,624 --> 00:07:00,624
Tigger,

113
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,803
you should talk to Clay.

114
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,383
We've find out what's going on.

115
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,354
We bring it to the table

116
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:11,430
and we get past this shit.
It's on us to fix this.

117
00:07:16,637 --> 00:07:17,637
What?

118
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:21,050
Just downloading to the prospect.

119
00:07:21,294 --> 00:07:22,994
And his new swollen nut.

120
00:07:25,405 --> 00:07:26,987
Welcome back, shithead.

121
00:07:28,466 --> 00:07:30,481
Chinese just called.
They want a sit-down.

122
00:07:30,606 --> 00:07:32,556
I got to head up to Caracara.

123
00:07:34,542 --> 00:07:35,692
Where's Clay?

124
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,275
I appreciate you helping us out.

125
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,700
You got my word.

126
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:42,982
Ain't gonna burn you on the bail.

127
00:07:43,107 --> 00:07:44,407
Thank your wife.

128
00:07:45,167 --> 00:07:48,550
Reminded me we're just a couple
of kids from a small town.

129
00:07:48,794 --> 00:07:51,419
I might need your help
protecting our small town.

130
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:53,394
- From what?
- Jacob Hale.

131
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:55,794
He's been using his clout
on city council.

132
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,543
In the last year,
he's changed three city charters,

133
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:00,718
giving more power to the mayor.

134
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,522
Mayor gig's pretty much ceremonial.

135
00:08:03,647 --> 00:08:04,747
Not anymore.

136
00:08:05,544 --> 00:08:08,169
The post has full veto authority
over town policy,

137
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:10,544
including eminent domain decisions.

138
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:13,575
Guess who's running for mayor?

139
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:15,289
Hale.

140
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,093
Wants your timberland.

141
00:08:17,218 --> 00:08:20,355
I've got to run against him.
It's the only way to protect this.

142
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,830
I need your help.

143
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,293
Sam Crow has sway over this town.

144
00:08:24,418 --> 00:08:26,088
You in my corner, I got a shot.

145
00:08:28,787 --> 00:08:30,987
There's something I need from you.

146
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:34,363
Piece of land, access road,

147
00:08:35,063 --> 00:08:36,063
power.

148
00:08:36,922 --> 00:08:39,172
- Something off the radar.
- Guns.

149
00:08:39,618 --> 00:08:41,518
You don't ever need to know.

150
00:08:45,918 --> 00:08:47,368
Show of good faith.

151
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:51,780
It's a knife
with your fingerprints on it

152
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,048
we used to kill the scumbag
raped your little girl.

153
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:56,978
I know what it is.

154
00:08:57,388 --> 00:08:59,413
I ain't got nothing on you now.

155
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,856
From here on out,
we got to trust each other.

156
00:09:03,357 --> 00:09:04,757
Just the good word

157
00:09:05,727 --> 00:09:07,127
of two honest men.

Episode 208: Potlatch

169
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:03,188
- Can you call Opie?
- What happened?

170
00:10:04,142 --> 00:10:05,492
Someone broke in.

171
00:10:05,918 --> 00:10:08,118
Stole our HD camera and my laptop.

172
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,105
Had three rough cuts on it.

173
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:11,230
Shit!

174
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,736
What happened to the guard dog
I bought you?

175
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,211
See for yourself.

176
00:10:20,376 --> 00:10:23,126
It's okay, sweetie.
No one's gonna hurt you.

177
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:27,976
Oh, man.

178
00:10:38,856 --> 00:10:40,056
Lyla's scared.

179
00:10:40,886 --> 00:10:42,086
She wants Ope.

180
00:10:49,285 --> 00:10:50,065
Hungry?

181
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:54,043
- Dim sum's better than good head.
- What do you want, Lin?

182
00:10:54,168 --> 00:10:57,612
Last time we visited your restaurant,
we were throwing shots at each other.

183
00:10:57,737 --> 00:10:59,324
Why I wanted to see you.

184
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:02,332
We need guns.

185
00:11:02,457 --> 00:11:04,982
Our distributor
is temporarily offline.

186
00:11:05,107 --> 00:11:08,233
If it was the feds that shut
your guy down, we're not interested.

187
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:10,006
Wasn't ATF. INS.

188
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:13,381
He's having a little trouble
getting into the country.

189
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,220
We know you deal AKs.

190
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,361
We'll pay double,
all you can get us.

191
00:11:23,497 --> 00:11:24,808
As a show of good faith,

192
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:28,103
a gift.

193
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:33,500
Shit.

194
00:11:35,624 --> 00:11:37,179
What the hell happened to his hands?

195
00:11:37,304 --> 00:11:40,809
My sexual proclivities,
they took their toll on Mr. Lin.

196
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,493
Can't grab it, can't pull it.

197
00:11:44,043 --> 00:11:45,162
I accept that.

198
00:11:45,693 --> 00:11:47,133
Jesus Christ, man.

199
00:11:47,426 --> 00:11:50,544
Turns out, you only need
two fingers to work a calculator.

200
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,675
He paid off his debt, but...

201
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:55,231
my new son-in-law's an accountant.

202
00:11:55,356 --> 00:11:57,341
Told my daughter
I'd give him the job, so,

203
00:11:57,857 --> 00:11:59,307
Chuck is all yours.

204
00:11:59,734 --> 00:12:00,784
We'll pass.

205
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,265
- Thought he was a friend of yours.
- I am.

206
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,426
Otto and me are best friends.

207
00:12:07,798 --> 00:12:09,921
We'll let you know about the guns.

208
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:13,065
Please, Clay, if you don't take me,
they're just gonna kill me.

209
00:12:13,234 --> 00:12:14,796
You're already dead in my book.

210
00:12:14,921 --> 00:12:16,921
Come on, Clay. Lin's a psycho.

211
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:19,539
We'll take him.

212
00:12:20,294 --> 00:12:21,294
What?

213
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:25,383
He can do the books at Caracara.
It'll free Bobby up.

214
00:12:25,884 --> 00:12:26,884
Get up.

215
00:12:27,657 --> 00:12:28,657
Come on.

216
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:44,450
Are we really going to the Irish
for the AKs

217
00:12:44,575 --> 00:12:46,144
knowing that Stahl's onto them?

218
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:48,029
We don't know anything
Stahl says is true.

219
00:12:48,154 --> 00:12:50,059
She'll tell you
anything to get what she wants.

220
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:52,483
We'll go to Edmond's.
We'll feel it out.

221
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:55,180
If he's got the guns, we figure out
a safe way to make the transaction.

222
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:57,526
If he doesn't,
then we know he's selling to Zobelle.

223
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:03,915
That was Jax. Got to go to Caracara.

224
00:13:04,297 --> 00:13:05,663
I'm gonna need you guys.

225
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:07,238
You stay available.

226
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,613
Take Chucky. Go on.

227
00:13:13,637 --> 00:13:14,637
What?

228
00:13:16,276 --> 00:13:18,326
Come on, open the door for him.

229
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,589
Fiona?

230
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:41,328
Mornin'.

231
00:13:46,164 --> 00:13:47,164
Jesus.

232
00:13:48,295 --> 00:13:50,245
What the hell you doing here?

233
00:13:50,984 --> 00:13:52,884
I heard about what happened.

234
00:13:54,423 --> 00:13:55,723
We were worried.

235
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,527
That's from Kerrianne.

236
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:07,812
You alone?

237
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:09,670
Doesn't matter.

238
00:14:09,795 --> 00:14:11,095
Came to see you.

239
00:14:11,922 --> 00:14:13,422
How are you feeling?

240
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:16,757
Like I was blown up.

241
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,567
Doctor says I'm healing.

242
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:21,642
I'm glad.

243
00:14:23,317 --> 00:14:25,067
Bad idea you coming here.

244
00:14:27,795 --> 00:14:30,295
My life's a series of bad ideas,
lovey.

245
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,791
Sleep.

246
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:44,289
<i>Mo ghr.</i>

247
00:14:47,171 --> 00:14:49,071
That dog cost me four grand.

248
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,998
And that was a $10,000 camera.

249
00:14:52,327 --> 00:14:54,427
Camera's insured. The rough cuts

250
00:14:54,867 --> 00:14:56,767
are worth ten times as much.

251
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,606
This had to be Georgie, right?

252
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,081
Of course it was.

253
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,201
They look pretty cozy.

254
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:07,276
I think they're kind of cute.

255
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,690
Reminds me of me and Otto.

256
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:13,703
She okay?

257
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,921
I think so.

258
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:17,009
Who did this?

259
00:15:17,134 --> 00:15:19,835
The shit that's missing,
it's got to be Caruso.

260
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:21,921
Let's go.

261
00:15:26,231 --> 00:15:27,431
See you later?

262
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:32,221
What time does Gemma
want us for dinner?

263
00:15:32,539 --> 00:15:33,348
8:00.

264
00:15:34,226 --> 00:15:36,865
Gemma's having a potlatch.
Wants us all there.

265
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,690
Sounds like a good idea.

266
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,391
I got Kenny and Ellie.

267
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
Bring 'em.

268
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,919
Lyla?

269
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,659
She's been helping me out.

270
00:15:50,607 --> 00:15:52,157
You serious about it?

271
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,453
I don't know.

272
00:15:53,578 --> 00:15:54,778
Kids like her.

273
00:15:54,903 --> 00:15:57,203
- You hitting it?
- Come on, Bobby.

274
00:15:59,218 --> 00:16:02,099
- We're just hanging out.
- Dude, she's a porn star.

275
00:16:02,224 --> 00:16:03,274
Your point?

276
00:16:03,489 --> 00:16:06,822
My point is she's a porn star.
You gotta hit it.

277
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:10,269
What do you know
about hooking up with porn stars?

278
00:16:11,529 --> 00:16:12,888
Just what I heard.

279
00:16:13,346 --> 00:16:15,985
You know, it can get, like...

280
00:16:16,492 --> 00:16:18,255
I have been around, you know?

281
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,641
I mean, it's like,
it gets crazy sometimes, you know?

282
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:25,312
You should bring her
to dinner tonight, man.

283
00:16:25,437 --> 00:16:27,237
Gemma won't mind. Come on.

284
00:16:32,832 --> 00:16:35,282
- What the hell, dude?
- Forgot. Shit.

285
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,299
It's a gift from the Chinese.
He could help with the books.

286
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:39,724
Nice to see you.

287
00:16:39,998 --> 00:16:41,695
They chopped them off?

288
00:16:42,206 --> 00:16:43,856
That is deep shit, man.

289
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:46,769
- I'm still adjusting.
- That mean you can't...?

290
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:47,923
I'm very thick.

291
00:16:48,093 --> 00:16:50,759
So, yes,
masturbation is pretty much impossible.

292
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:52,661
That's gotta suck.

293
00:16:52,786 --> 00:16:56,158
I'm very indebted to all of you.
Lin's been out of his mind.

294
00:16:56,283 --> 00:16:59,333
- Why is that?
- He's losing turf to the Mexicans.

295
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Heroin?

296
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,770
Mayans took over everything
south of Water Street.

297
00:17:03,895 --> 00:17:06,997
- That's why they need the guns.
- That's pushing it on niners' turf.

298
00:17:07,122 --> 00:17:08,972
What does that mean for us?

299
00:17:10,611 --> 00:17:12,928
Georgie's studio's halfway
to Oaktown.

300
00:17:13,053 --> 00:17:14,699
Maybe we should check in on Laroy.

301
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:17,593
Come with us, chucky.

302
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:20,580
- We'll put you to use.
- I accept that.

303
00:17:22,988 --> 00:17:24,588
Late night at the pub?

304
00:17:25,547 --> 00:17:28,256
In the future, I'd appreciate a little
heads-up before you fellas drop in.

305
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,674
Where's the russian Aks, man?

306
00:17:31,722 --> 00:17:32,722
Sold them.

307
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:34,485
To who?

308
00:17:37,026 --> 00:17:39,824
Guessing you wouldn't want us telling
other customers who you were.

309
00:17:39,949 --> 00:17:41,017
Our deal was,

310
00:17:41,753 --> 00:17:44,453
we move your handguns,
you sell us the aks.

311
00:17:45,837 --> 00:17:48,686
When we get more,
you'll be the first to know.

312
00:17:48,811 --> 00:17:49,573
Bullshit.

313
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:51,528
You don't mind if I take
another look around?

314
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,197
- Don't take kindly to your suspicions.
- It's okay.

315
00:17:56,676 --> 00:18:00,161
We just got an unexpected order,
and we was hoping to fill it is all.

316
00:18:01,196 --> 00:18:02,196
Next time.

317
00:18:15,669 --> 00:18:17,965
- Those guns are in that house, man.
- I know.

318
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:20,735
- Means they're selling to Zobelle.
- We keep eyes on them.

319
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,170
Zobelle's crew shows up,
we take our guns back.

320
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,103
Sack, you got the first shift.

321
00:18:25,598 --> 00:18:26,598
Right.

322
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:29,877
They were pissed.

323
00:18:30,311 --> 00:18:33,411
Clay backed them off,
but he knew something was up.

324
00:18:34,582 --> 00:18:38,332
We sure about this, da?
We haven't even cleared it with Jimmy O.

325
00:18:41,297 --> 00:18:42,697
I'll let you know.

326
00:18:46,881 --> 00:18:48,258
Morning, lovey.

327
00:18:53,453 --> 00:18:54,453
Your dad?

328
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,320
Who's Jimmy O?

329
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,857
He's no one you'd ever want to meet.

330
00:19:32,902 --> 00:19:35,215
You're a long way from home,
sweetheart.

331
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,814
Yes. I am.

332
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,178
Why?

333
00:19:40,468 --> 00:19:42,168
I was worried about him.

334
00:19:42,369 --> 00:19:43,765
Could've sent flowers.

335
00:19:44,237 --> 00:19:46,518
Just needed to see him, Gemma.

336
00:19:48,111 --> 00:19:49,966
We are in a shitstorm here.

337
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:53,331
The last thing we need
is you turning him inside out.

338
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,531
Hello.

339
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,107
Dr. Knowles,

340
00:20:03,152 --> 00:20:04,302
Fiona Larkin.

341
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,163
Nice to meet you.
I'm afraid

342
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:08,832
icu is for immediate
family members only.

343
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,518
She is family.

344
00:20:12,749 --> 00:20:13,899
I'm his wife.

345
00:20:35,032 --> 00:20:36,032
Pardon me.

346
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:39,904
What do you need?

347
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:42,729
I called Mr.
Caruso about watching my reel.

348
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,425
Mutilation fetish.

349
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:51,128
Wait here.

350
00:20:57,951 --> 00:20:58,951
He's here.

351
00:21:10,204 --> 00:21:11,454
Not interested.

352
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:13,849
I got something else.

353
00:21:15,406 --> 00:21:16,406
Mother...!

354
00:21:26,394 --> 00:21:28,077
- Get out.
- Now!

355
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,676
How does that feel, you dead bitch?

356
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,097
Come in, "OJ."

357
00:21:56,657 --> 00:21:58,007
Get us the camera

358
00:21:58,288 --> 00:22:00,360
before my boy here
crushes his throat.

359
00:22:03,096 --> 00:22:04,656
Get the goddamn camera.

360
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,534
I'll cover him.

361
00:22:17,026 --> 00:22:18,990
I'm guessing this one's ours

362
00:22:19,433 --> 00:22:21,556
but maybe we should
take both just in case.

363
00:22:21,681 --> 00:22:22,966
All my shit's on that one!

364
00:22:23,948 --> 00:22:24,948
This one?

365
00:22:26,093 --> 00:22:27,220
You son of a bitch.

366
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:32,295
Don't!

367
00:22:34,193 --> 00:22:37,605
That's for killing the dog,
you psycho piece of shit.

368
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,565
You think this is how it works?

369
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:43,736
You idiots could just crash in here
and take stuff from me?

370
00:22:45,484 --> 00:22:46,853
You got no idea.

371
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:49,786
You white trash morons,
you got no...

372
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:51,361
Lyla's with me now.

373
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:54,040
You touch her,

374
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,165
call her,

375
00:22:55,716 --> 00:22:57,266
even think about her,

376
00:22:58,229 --> 00:22:59,429
I'll kill you.

377
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:19,112
Come on, chucky, boy.
I think we owe you a drink.

378
00:23:19,237 --> 00:23:21,352
Yeah, two fingers of tequila.

379
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,008
Humor's very healing.

380
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,737
I think Georgie could
use a drink and a laugh.

381
00:23:28,711 --> 00:23:30,658
What do we do here?

382
00:23:37,446 --> 00:23:38,992
I didn't know Chibs was married.

383
00:23:39,117 --> 00:23:40,993
They never got divorced.

384
00:23:41,259 --> 00:23:44,159
It's been a long time
since they were together.

385
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,132
Sounds like she's not a favorite.

386
00:23:46,943 --> 00:23:49,726
There's only been three women
I'm afraid of...

387
00:23:49,851 --> 00:23:50,803
My mother,

388
00:23:51,189 --> 00:23:53,074
my third grade math teacher

389
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:55,405
and that irish bitch.

390
00:23:59,757 --> 00:24:02,356
Where's Chibs at...
his insurance shit?

391
00:24:02,682 --> 00:24:04,309
He'll be off critical
in a day or two.

392
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:07,284
He'll have to finish
his recovery at Stockton.

393
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:08,696
That can't happen.

394
00:24:09,234 --> 00:24:11,236
Not with her around.
He can't be out of our sight.

395
00:24:11,361 --> 00:24:14,369
- There's nothing I can do.
- There's always something we can do.

396
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:23,635
You see that redhead?

397
00:24:25,154 --> 00:24:26,881
Margaret Murphy,
chief administrator.

398
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,421
She has been up my ass
about the club.

399
00:24:29,546 --> 00:24:31,996
I try anything,
she'll be all over it.

400
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:33,596
It can't happen.

401
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:45,641
Going down?

402
00:24:46,732 --> 00:24:47,782
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:24:57,798 --> 00:24:58,830
Where's the van?

404
00:24:59,266 --> 00:25:01,016
Jax and the guys took it.

405
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:06,888
This thing with Jax, man,

406
00:25:07,033 --> 00:25:09,411
you haven't said much.
Is it that Donna thing?

407
00:25:09,536 --> 00:25:10,809
That's part of it.

408
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:12,334
Anything I can do?

409
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:13,428
I doubt it.

410
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,805
That shit already's
got you spun around.

411
00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:18,753
Wh-what does that mean?

412
00:25:19,033 --> 00:25:22,033
Killing Donna...
it's flipped some switch in you.

413
00:25:23,016 --> 00:25:24,772
Not even sure
that patch makes sense.

414
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:28,199
You think I can't make
the hard call?

415
00:25:28,331 --> 00:25:30,487
With all the shit that I've done
for you and this club?

416
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,948
It's not about the shit you've done,
it's about the shit you may have to do.

417
00:25:34,116 --> 00:25:35,472
I can do my job.

418
00:25:37,631 --> 00:25:38,781
Good to know.

419
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,261
Weston just got here, one other guy.

420
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:47,128
- Follow the guns.
- Right.

421
00:25:49,591 --> 00:25:50,923
Call everybody.

422
00:25:58,844 --> 00:25:59,921
What do you want?

423
00:26:00,046 --> 00:26:02,176
Laroy won't mind us dropping by.

424
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:04,113
Wait here.

425
00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:05,749
We know the way.

426
00:26:11,618 --> 00:26:12,618
Pardon me.

427
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:14,572
Orange fanta, please.

428
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:23,456
Shit,

429
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,774
new owners.

430
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:28,419
We should go.

431
00:26:59,987 --> 00:27:02,045
Weston has the guns up
ahead at the rest stop.

432
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:04,168
Looks like they're waiting
for a pick up.

433
00:27:04,293 --> 00:27:05,693
Where is everyone?

434
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:07,846
Get them on the phone.

435
00:27:08,111 --> 00:27:10,261
- I want them here!
- All right.

436
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:18,152
Probably should've called ahead
and made sure Laroy was home.

437
00:27:18,741 --> 00:27:20,471
That would've been the smart play.

438
00:27:21,454 --> 00:27:24,554
It's gotta be Clay wondering
where the hell we are.

439
00:27:28,417 --> 00:27:31,267
Heard things got pretty
out of hand in county.

440
00:27:33,554 --> 00:27:36,404
You and me always been able
to talk about shit.

441
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:38,044
Not lately.

442
00:27:42,472 --> 00:27:45,758
Think maybe it's got something to do
with this beef you got going with Clay?

443
00:27:45,883 --> 00:27:49,166
- Maybe if I knew what it was...
- It's about keeping shit contained.

444
00:27:49,658 --> 00:27:51,919
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

445
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:54,494
You getting in deeper with Clay.

446
00:27:57,187 --> 00:27:58,353
I don't know.

447
00:27:59,959 --> 00:28:02,409
I feel like I'm losing
all my friends.

448
00:28:05,644 --> 00:28:07,685
Laroy don't live here no more, ese.

449
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,230
- We put that together.
- Where'd you get the russian hardware?

450
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:12,913
New friends,

451
00:28:13,196 --> 00:28:14,317
new opportunities.

452
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:17,650
You got a point to make,
make it quick.

453
00:28:17,775 --> 00:28:19,405
My mom's expecting us for dinner.

454
00:28:20,684 --> 00:28:21,991
So I'm not invited?

455
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,076
I might need someone
to bus a few tables.

456
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:26,877
<i>Hijo de puta!</i>

457
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:34,179
You tell Clay that bullshit truce
we had is off the table.

458
00:28:34,374 --> 00:28:36,149
Every state, every charter.

459
00:28:36,274 --> 00:28:37,590
Mayans are no friends of...

460
00:28:42,831 --> 00:28:44,331
Get 'em out of here.

461
00:28:44,845 --> 00:28:46,345
And take their cuts.

462
00:28:46,994 --> 00:28:48,694
That ain't gonna happen.

463
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,106
You will lay it at my feet,<i>cabrón</i>.

464
00:28:54,797 --> 00:28:58,801
Pull the trigger, man. It's the only
way this leather's coming off my back.

465
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:02,580
Summer of love may be over,
jefe, but

466
00:29:03,188 --> 00:29:04,809
killing the mother charter's vp?

467
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:07,484
You might want to think
about that move.

468
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,420
Next time a son walks
into mayan territory,

469
00:29:23,059 --> 00:29:24,387
they don't walk out.

470
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:43,760
Shit.

471
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:47,594
What do we know?

472
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:49,578
We know she's dead.

473
00:29:50,642 --> 00:29:51,942
Beaten to death.

474
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:53,791
Saw some wood slivers.

475
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:56,076
Probably a bat.

476
00:29:58,215 --> 00:29:59,815
Call for a body wagon.

477
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,302
What the hell is this?

478
00:30:15,661 --> 00:30:17,440
- Right there.
- Do not move!

479
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,654
Easy.

480
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:30,995
Think you may have accidentally
picked up our order.

481
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:39,670
Yeah,
these are definitely our cigars.

482
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:43,821
Something funny, white boy?

483
00:30:43,946 --> 00:30:46,427
It's just amazing
how bad your timing is.

484
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:48,233
Shit!

485
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,830
Drop 'em! Drop em!

486
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:01,976
Shit, want the guns!

487
00:31:06,396 --> 00:31:07,396
Cover him.

488
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,384
Come on, let it go.

489
00:31:34,555 --> 00:31:36,044
Jesus christ!

490
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,978
How the hell did that happen?

491
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:40,414
They follow you?

492
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:42,441
Not sure.
We whole?

493
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:46,751
Load 'em.

494
00:31:47,613 --> 00:31:49,031
I'll follow you to the delivery.

495
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:51,499
Zobelle wants to do this personally.

496
00:31:51,694 --> 00:31:53,536
You should head back
to the cigar shop

497
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:56,043
before something else goes wrong.

498
00:31:56,807 --> 00:31:59,107
And you should adjust your attitude.

499
00:32:20,228 --> 00:32:22,523
- Thought you were bringing a salad.
- I've been busy.

500
00:32:26,223 --> 00:32:27,223
What?

501
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:33,250
This is a hostile work environment
claim filed against me and myproxy

502
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:34,841
by Margaret Murphy.

503
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,203
Are you kidding me?

504
00:32:37,603 --> 00:32:40,553
- What a bunch of pussies.
- You threatened her.

505
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:43,961
I had a passionate conversation
with her in the elevator.

506
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,729
This is my livelihood!

507
00:32:46,615 --> 00:32:50,050
Do you have any idea how hard
I've worked to get to where I am?

508
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:52,011
I get it.

509
00:32:52,578 --> 00:32:55,361
Do you?
This could cost me my goddamn job.

510
00:32:56,815 --> 00:33:00,185
The club is the club,
my life is my life. Stay out of it.

511
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:07,010
Perfect.

512
00:33:07,307 --> 00:33:09,324
Serving hand jobs for dessert?

513
00:33:10,966 --> 00:33:13,032
That's real nice
in front of the kids.

514
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,783
- Where you going?
- Home.

515
00:33:40,271 --> 00:33:42,238
I am tired of taking abuse.

516
00:33:42,613 --> 00:33:44,521
That doctor's an arrogant bitch.

517
00:33:46,869 --> 00:33:47,869
Sorry.

518
00:33:49,379 --> 00:33:50,679
Thanks, brother.

519
00:33:53,879 --> 00:33:55,927
Jesus christ, here we go.

520
00:33:56,052 --> 00:33:57,352
Dinner with mom.

521
00:34:07,385 --> 00:34:10,339
Weston almost lost
the guns to Sam Crow.

522
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,967
He got all bent out of shape
when he couldn't deliver them to you.

523
00:34:16,296 --> 00:34:19,247
Mr. Weston does a lot
of things very well,

524
00:34:19,888 --> 00:34:23,477
but understanding the need for
this type of relationship evades him.

525
00:34:34,066 --> 00:34:35,616
That's not necessary.

526
00:34:36,722 --> 00:34:38,364
This is the third delivery

527
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,830
you haven't let me pay for.

528
00:34:39,955 --> 00:34:41,662
It's not the way business is done.

529
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,465
I'm a venture capitalist,
Mr. Alvarez.

530
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,184
I'm investing in the future
of your organization.

531
00:34:49,111 --> 00:34:50,713
Talk to your associates in,

532
00:34:51,108 --> 00:34:52,665
Stockton and Pelican Bay.

533
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:55,618
They'll assure you,
I'm a fair player

534
00:34:56,017 --> 00:34:57,428
and a good friend to have.

535
00:34:58,531 --> 00:34:59,531
I will.

536
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:16,756
Can you ease up on Lyla?

537
00:35:16,881 --> 00:35:18,699
- She's just...
- I know...

538
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,250
doing her best.

539
00:35:22,528 --> 00:35:24,117
I keep hanging out with this family,

540
00:35:24,242 --> 00:35:26,206
I may be sucking cock
to pay my bills, too.

541
00:35:27,161 --> 00:35:28,917
What the hell's the matter with you?

542
00:35:30,321 --> 00:35:31,700
Ask your mother.

543
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:34,160
- What happened?
- Come on, everybody.

544
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:35,985
Come on, let's sit down.

545
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,782
- Where the hell were you?
- What are you talking about?

546
00:35:50,907 --> 00:35:54,485
Two guys are at the hospital,
and you decide not to pick up the phone.

547
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,425
We were neck-deep
in our own pile of shit.

548
00:35:56,550 --> 00:35:59,573
We almost got killed
trying to take back our guns, man.

549
00:36:00,022 --> 00:36:01,867
Club business.
Not here, asshole.

550
00:36:04,605 --> 00:36:06,305
- Come on!
- I mean it.

551
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:10,050
Hey, they were helping me, Clay.

552
00:36:10,175 --> 00:36:12,339
We had some payback
to deliver at Caracara.

553
00:36:12,464 --> 00:36:14,811
Hopefully, it went a little bit better
than the trammel task.

554
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:17,136
- Blow me, shithead.
- Excuse me.

555
00:36:18,533 --> 00:36:20,013
Sorry to interrupt.

556
00:36:23,388 --> 00:36:26,088
I figured I should tell you
this in person.

557
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:33,572
We just found Luann Delaney
off county 18.

558
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:36,286
Beaten to death.

559
00:36:37,944 --> 00:36:40,194
There's no other details right now.

560
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:45,137
I'm sorry.

561
00:36:57,706 --> 00:36:59,156
Did you cause this?

562
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:03,476
- What are you talking about?
- Payback

563
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,334
- at Caracara.
- This is on me, Clay.

564
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:07,286
- And me, too.
- What did you idiots do?

565
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:09,535
I'm not talking to you, asshole.

566
00:37:12,942 --> 00:37:15,044
You see what you're doing
to this club?

567
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:17,141
Do you see what you're
doing to this club?!

568
00:37:17,266 --> 00:37:19,778
I was risking my ass for this club.

569
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:20,941
Bullshit.

570
00:37:21,066 --> 00:37:23,240
You're as blind as you are crippled.

571
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:27,359
The blind guy's in jail with no wife
'cause you just got her killed.

572
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,913
I'm not the one murdering women!

573
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:04,849
