I find your career so fascinating.

14
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,146
What's it like to
interview serial killers?

15
00:00:48,271 --> 00:00:50,055
Well, it's never boring.

16
00:00:50,426 --> 00:00:53,344
Is that what you enjoy most about,
looking evil right in the eye?

17
00:00:53,768 --> 00:00:56,121
No, it's putting killers in jail.

18
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:58,849
You know what gets me are the wives
who swear they had no clue

19
00:00:59,151 --> 00:01:02,517
- their husband was a serial killer.
- How can you be married and not know?

20
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:04,895
Theresa, would you mind
calling up my car service?

21
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:06,026
Not at all.

22
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:07,739
- You'll excuse me?
- Sure.

23
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:14,365
Hi. I'm a big fan.

24
00:01:14,576 --> 00:01:16,638
There's not gonna be a quiz.
I saw you taking notes.

25
00:01:16,763 --> 00:01:19,097
No, it's just for
my own edification.

26
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:21,369
Agent Rossi, are you or
anyone in your department

27
00:01:21,494 --> 00:01:24,090
investigating the recent spike
in homicides in Cleveland?

28
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:25,790
Not that I'm aware of.

29
00:01:25,915 --> 00:01:27,670
There's been an uptick in homicides

30
00:01:27,839 --> 00:01:31,522
by 11% this quarter, the average
uptick hasn't surpassed 5%

31
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:33,487
in the past 10 years in Cleveland.

32
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:35,475
I'm guessing you're
studying criminology.

33
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,600
I am.

34
00:01:38,809 --> 00:01:40,683
I think there's
a serial killer here.

35
00:01:41,572 --> 00:01:44,277
Well, have the police issued a statement
to corroborate that?

36
00:01:44,402 --> 00:01:47,648
I filed an inquiry downtown.
Nobody's called me back.

37
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,775
But, I know that
the coroner's office

38
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:53,654
hasn't been as busy since the 1930s
the butcher of Kingsbury run.

39
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:56,334
What kind of homicides
are we talking about here?

40
00:01:57,499 --> 00:02:00,769
A man was shot in a park, a prostitute
was found with her throat slashed,

41
00:02:00,894 --> 00:02:03,244
a couple was found shot in their car,

42
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:05,696
a woman was killed in a burglary.

43
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:09,378
Do you know what 3 things profilers
look at to link serial crimes?

44
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:11,672
Victimology, modus operandi,
and signature.

45
00:02:11,885 --> 00:02:13,507
Good. So were the victims similar?

46
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,519
- Was the m. o. consistent?
- No.

47
00:02:16,644 --> 00:02:18,594
Was the signature consistent?

48
00:02:18,843 --> 00:02:21,145
- Not that I know of.
- Then there's no obvious reason

49
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,684
to suggest that the spike in violence
was due to a serial killer.

50
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:27,152
I see your point, sir, but I really...

51
00:02:27,277 --> 00:02:29,571
You're bright. You obviously
have a passion for this,

52
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:32,071
and the bureau is always
looking for good people.

53
00:02:32,196 --> 00:02:35,360
So if you get a reply from the police,
or even for career advice,

54
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:37,281
I'm available.

55
00:02:39,619 --> 00:02:42,448
OK, thanks. It was an honor to meet you.

56
00:02:44,118 --> 00:02:45,510
Keep studying, and don't stop

57
00:02:45,635 --> 00:02:48,044
until you find all the answers
you're looking for.

58
00:02:48,558 --> 00:02:49,558
I won't.

59
00:04:09,551 --> 00:04:10,416
Excuse me.

60
00:04:11,646 --> 00:04:12,646
Get back!

61
00:04:13,254 --> 00:04:14,904
- Get back!
- It's OK.

62
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:15,921
It's OK.

63
00:04:16,132 --> 00:04:18,924
Look, I'm not gonna hurt you, OK?
I live in the neighborhood.

64
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:23,236
- What's your address?
- 817 Tivoli. It's right down that way.

65
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,114
Look, if I was gonna hurt you,
I wouldn't have said "excuse me". OK?

66
00:04:30,409 --> 00:04:31,509
Are we cool?

67
00:04:36,203 --> 00:04:38,151
What the hell, man? You scared me.

68
00:04:38,432 --> 00:04:40,076
I'm... I'm sorry.

69
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,240
What are you doing here?

70
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:46,624
I was walking home from the liquor store
and I saw you snooping around.

71
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:48,272
What about you?

72
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:50,038
So you heard what happened here?

73
00:04:53,111 --> 00:04:54,161
Poor woman.

74
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:58,464
All the neighbors are freaking out.
I can't believe I didn't know her name.

75
00:04:58,875 --> 00:04:59,975
Kayla James.

76
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:02,635
She was raped, too.

77
00:05:04,246 --> 00:05:06,053
Can't believe this
happened on my street.

78
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:07,681
It's not just your street.

79
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,892
There's been a lot of murders lately.

80
00:05:11,284 --> 00:05:12,284
Really?

81
00:05:12,974 --> 00:05:15,702
Yeah, it's uncharacteristically
high for our city.

82
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:20,186
You with the police or something?

83
00:05:20,311 --> 00:05:22,320
I'm just investigating a few cases.

84
00:05:24,245 --> 00:05:26,909
Gosh, all of a sudden,
all these random, violent murders.

85
00:05:28,621 --> 00:05:30,486
Something weird is going on here.

86
00:05:31,959 --> 00:05:33,578
What do you mean by weird?

87
00:05:54,183 --> 00:05:55,646
I'll be right down.

88
00:06:05,273 --> 00:06:06,848
I'm detective Dan Brady.

89
00:06:07,049 --> 00:06:09,199
We found your card on the victim.

90
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:17,173
Any idea what happened here?

She was found by a woman
walking her dog this morning.

98
00:07:08,397 --> 00:07:09,962
Dog wouldn't stop barking.

99
00:07:10,255 --> 00:07:12,049
I just talked to her last night.

100
00:07:12,305 --> 00:07:13,955
I never asked her name.

101
00:07:14,714 --> 00:07:15,726
Zoe Hawkes.

102
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:19,245
That's her car right there.
These keys were still in her pocket.

103
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,848
Car alarm was still activated.
There was no sign of a break-in.

104
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,900
She had pepper spray,
but didn't use it?

105
00:07:24,657 --> 00:07:26,987
I don't know,
maybe she didn't get the chance.

106
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:28,989
- Nobody saw or heard anything?
- No.

107
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:30,834
We went door to door. No witnesses.

108
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:34,010
There was blunt-force trauma
to her head, signs of strangulation.

109
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,788
Murderer asphyxiated her
with the scarf she was wearing.

110
00:07:37,188 --> 00:07:40,298
Do you have any idea what she was doing
snooping around this case?

111
00:07:40,423 --> 00:07:42,877
You keep talking like I know something.
What case?

112
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:44,921
The resident of this house,

113
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,924
was murdered and raped 3 days ago
in a burglary-homicide.

114
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,051
<i>I think there's
a serial killer here.</i>

115
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,998
<i>And don't stop until you find all
the answers you're looking for.</i>

116
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:54,097
<i>I won't.</i>

117
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:58,977
This is Henry wearing the booties
my mom knitted him.

118
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,959
I can't get over his cuteness.

119
00:08:02,393 --> 00:08:05,858
And this is him wearing
the customized leather jacket

120
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,728
auntie Penelope got him.

121
00:08:07,853 --> 00:08:09,905
When he grows up,
he's gonna be a rebel.

122
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,210
Is this David Rossi, the famous
bestselling author David Rossi?

123
00:08:15,746 --> 00:08:18,311
<i>You're not supposed to be calling
when you're on annual leave.</i>

124
00:08:18,436 --> 00:08:19,915
I think my a.l. just ended.

125
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,292
- What do you mean?
- <i>Garcia, Cleveland police</i>

126
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:26,170

to distribute them to the team.

127
00:08:26,436 --> 00:08:27,921
Yeah. What are we looking at?

128
00:08:28,046 --> 00:08:30,008
<i>I don't know yet.
Just see if the team</i>

129
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,209
can find a connection
with these crimes.

130
00:08:32,334 --> 00:08:34,534
I'll call you back in a few hours.

131
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,521
She had a notebook
with her last night.

132
00:08:38,646 --> 00:08:39,937
I saw one in her car.

133
00:08:40,062 --> 00:08:41,270
Can I take a look?

134
00:08:41,596 --> 00:08:43,974
It may be evidence,
but I don't see why not.

135
00:08:44,503 --> 00:08:46,319
Have you been to her house yet?

136
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:49,744
I'm headed there now.
I have to notify the next of kin.

137
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:54,447
<i>Now, if you get a reply

138

00:08:58,564 --> 00:09:00,372
<i>It was an honor to meet you.</i>

141
00:09:11,756 --> 00:09:12,956
Sheila Hawkes?

142
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:16,306
Hi. I'm detective Brady
with the Cleveland police department.

143
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,264
This is agent Rossi with the FBI.

144
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,682
May we come in?

145
00:09:19,807 --> 00:09:21,768
- Why?
- It's about your daughter.

146
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:24,521
That...

147
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,274
that's... that's one of her journals.
Has something happened?

148
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:31,840
She was murdered.

149
00:09:34,788 --> 00:09:35,988
I am so sorry.

150
00:09:37,513 --> 00:09:38,837
Here, let me help you.

151
00:09:44,574 --> 00:09:45,985
Where did you find her?

152
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:48,278
She was in a house
in east Cleveland.

153
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:51,703
We think she may have been
visiting a crime scene.

154
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,980
God...

155
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,242
I told her to stop doing that.

156
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:58,972
I told her that was too dangerous.

157
00:10:01,657 --> 00:10:02,767
Where is she now?

158
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:06,260
She's at the coroner's office,
and I can take you when you're ready.

159
00:10:06,385 --> 00:10:09,204
OK. Now. Right now.
I have to go right now.

160
00:10:10,255 --> 00:10:12,652
Mrs. Hawkes, would you
mind if I stayed behind

161
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,321
to look in her room?

162
00:10:22,068 --> 00:10:24,880
She was so excited to meet you.
You're like a...

163
00:10:25,736 --> 00:10:27,418
a hero to her.

164
00:10:32,155 --> 00:10:34,805
Mrs. Hawkes.
Let me take you downtown now.

165
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:40,371
Come on.

166
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:44,852
I'll... I'll send a car for you.

167
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:35,110
- The crimes are within a 7-mile radius.
- Well, that's something.

168
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:36,960
But the neighborhoods are all different.

169
00:11:37,085 --> 00:11:39,631
They range from poor to rich,
industrial to residential.

170
00:11:39,756 --> 00:11:43,493
The physical locations are dissimulate,
but the operating zone's well-defined.

171
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,328
- OK. I'm in.
- I see you.

172
00:11:45,732 --> 00:11:48,456
<i>In your web browser for search history.</i>

173
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,083
Check out her home page.

174
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,503
So the first thing she looks at when she
opens her computer is a crime column.

175
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:57,049
- <i>To stay current on her studies.</i>
- Can you see what she worked on last?

176
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:01,511
<i>Voilà</i>. These are the most recently
opened documents she created.

177
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,846
She was compiling

178
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,232
empirical data about
homicide trends in Cleveland.

179
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:09,603
- Do you think she knew the killer?
- Any notes indicating suspects.

180
00:12:10,294 --> 00:12:13,356
<i>She's a criminology student.
She's been taught to analyze statistics</i>

181
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:15,775
and apply theory,
not investigate killers.

182
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,654
Let's talk about what we know.

183
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:21,779
All right. Victim one... Travis
Bartlett was last seen at a gay bar.

184
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:23,700
He was shot at night in a park.

185
00:12:23,885 --> 00:12:27,389
Victim 2, Lily Nicks,
a 34-year-old prostitute,

186
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,830
her throat was slashed.

187
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:30,289
Victims 3 and 4,

188
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,169
June Appleby and Troy Wertsler
were shot in their car at a parking lot

189
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:35,837
outside of a movie theater.

190
00:12:36,006 --> 00:12:38,807
And victim 5 was
a 28-year-old single woman,

191
00:12:38,932 --> 00:12:40,891
Kayla James, killed in her home.

192
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,179
She was bound, suffocated
with a bag over her head,

193
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,551
evidence of rape.
And then the sixth victim was Zoe.

194
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:51,097
Victimology, weapons used,
and c. o. d. are all different.

195
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:53,163
It's hard to imagine
it's even the same unsub.

196
00:12:53,288 --> 00:12:54,945
It can't be a coincidence

197
00:12:55,070 --> 00:12:57,820
that Zoe goes to Kayla James' house
and gets murdered.

198
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,569
<i>Let's say it is the same killer.</i>

199
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:02,531
- Does anybody see a pattern?
- Well, maybe.

200
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,448
OK, the first crime,

201
00:13:04,957 --> 00:13:06,970
he shoots the victim.
The second crime,

202
00:13:07,095 --> 00:13:09,704
he rapes a woman and slashes
her throat. That's more personal.

203
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:13,094
And the third crime, he escalates
to killing two people,

204
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:15,369
and the fourth, he escalates even more

205
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,754
by raping a woman, binding
her, and suffocating her.

206
00:13:18,187 --> 00:13:19,951
So if it is the same unsub,
you could argue

207
00:13:20,076 --> 00:13:22,504
that there's a progression
of violence with every kill.

208
00:13:22,629 --> 00:13:26,568
It could be anger excitation offender
getting more daring with each crime.

209
00:13:26,865 --> 00:13:29,565
I think I got something here.
Look at this.

210
00:13:30,205 --> 00:13:32,317
The slashes
in the prostitute's throat...

211
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,021
they're all shallow, unsure cuts.

212
00:13:36,312 --> 00:13:38,185
The Kayla James crime scene...

213
00:13:38,699 --> 00:13:41,800
telephone cord, rope,
and duct tape were used.

214
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,988
he couldn't decide how to bind her.

215
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:45,659
So without a gun,

216
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,634
he's sloppy, inexperienced.

217
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:50,035
The young couple shot in the car...

218
00:13:51,712 --> 00:13:55,208
- Crime scene remind you of anything?
- They were shot with a.44 bulldog,

219
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:57,919
just like the son of Sam
used on his victims, which were

220
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,246
<i>also young couples in parked cars.</i>

221
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:03,900
It might be nothing, but you're
right, there is a parallel there.

222
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:06,865
With the second victim, it's hard
not to think of jack the ripper.

223
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:10,556
<i>The obvious similarity being it's
a prostitute whose throat was slashed.</i>

224
00:14:11,425 --> 00:14:12,825
Kayla James was...

225
00:14:13,657 --> 00:14:17,062
bound, tortured, raped, with a plastic
bag over her head like BTK.

226
00:14:21,412 --> 00:14:23,362
<i>What about victim number one?</i>

227
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,217
<i>What neighborhood was he found in?</i>

228
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:27,823
At a park in the Kingsbury run area.

229
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:30,089
Zoe reminded me last night

230
00:14:30,214 --> 00:14:32,539
that Cleveland's most
famous serial killer

231
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:34,580
was the butcher of Kingsbury run.

232
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:38,275
<i>He found his victims
in gay bars, shot them,</i>

233
00:14:38,665 --> 00:14:40,211
<i>and dumped their body there.</i>

234
00:14:40,815 --> 00:14:43,515
Travis Bartlett was
last seen at a gay bar,

235
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:46,551
and his body was found
in Kingsbury park.

236
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,217
So these are copycats
of famous serial killers?

237
00:14:52,342 --> 00:14:53,516
<i>He's a serial killer</i>

238
00:14:53,735 --> 00:14:55,435
studying serial killers.

239
00:14:59,707 --> 00:15:01,237
<i>See you in Cleveland, Dave.</i>

240
00:15:44,821 --> 00:15:46,736
We're in that room.
Coffee's brewing.

241
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:50,155
- We'll get started on the evidence.
- Detective Brady's our point.

242
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,725
I'll let you all introduce yourselves.

243
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,703
Can you help me out with something?

244
00:15:56,828 --> 00:15:57,664
Sure.

245
00:16:00,478 --> 00:16:01,834
This has to be confidential.

246
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,799
I know it may seem farfetched, but

247
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,045
copycat killers are not
entirely uncommon.

248
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:10,213
This one happens to be copying
several killers.

249
00:16:10,338 --> 00:16:13,847
If he's trying to be the butcher,
why didn't he cut up and mutilate them?

250
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,390
That was 7 weeks ago.
He was just getting started.

251
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:19,637
Beginning killers are often
frightened of the crime itself.

252
00:16:19,762 --> 00:16:22,160
They're more interested in getting
it over with quickly

253
00:16:22,285 --> 00:16:23,633
and fleeing the scene.

254
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:27,001
He was using the butcher's ruse as a way
to lure the victim to be alone with her.

255
00:16:27,126 --> 00:16:30,574
And by the time he killed Kayla,
he'd progressed. He came very close

256
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,406
to copying all of the BTK's m. o.

257
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:35,245
He's reading, learning,
borrowing from others

258
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,987
because he doesn't know who he is yet.

259
00:16:37,112 --> 00:16:39,705
We think he's young and impressionable,
maybe even a student.

260
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:41,813
Someone probably enrolled
in criminology classes.

261
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,127
Our technical analyst is going through
names of local students right now.

262
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,208
Up to this point, changing his m.o.

263
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,396
has prevented investigators
from linking the crimes.

264
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:52,030
- That's why we need to work quickly.
- You're sure about this?

265
00:16:52,155 --> 00:16:55,794
It's not a coincidence that all of these
random murders in a localized area

266
00:16:55,919 --> 00:16:57,598
are copycats of serial killers.

267
00:16:57,837 --> 00:17:00,762
It's as if all the worst serial killers
have converged on Cleveland.

268
00:17:00,887 --> 00:17:03,321
Every time he plans to kill,
the murder weapon, the m. o.,

269
00:17:03,446 --> 00:17:05,393
and the victimology will all change.

270
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:37,763
Will you let your team know we're ready
to give a preliminary profile.

271
00:17:37,932 --> 00:17:39,378
Sure. I gotta go.

272
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,102
I'm gonna step out for this one,
clear my head.

273
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:47,812
Garcia found 3 male students

274
00:17:47,937 --> 00:17:50,349
enrolled in criminology
classes with felony records.

275
00:17:50,474 --> 00:17:52,745
- Good. We'll interview them.
- I don't think we need to.

276
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:55,824
One of them is studying abroad,
the other 2 are back in jail.

277
00:17:57,116 --> 00:17:59,937
Tell Garcia to check enrollment
in online and correspondence courses,

278
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:02,372
see if we have any luck
with those parameters.

279
00:18:07,409 --> 00:18:09,309
You guys handle the profile?

280
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:12,141
- Yeah. Everything OK?
- Everything's fine.

281
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:16,009
We have 6 homicides
in a 7-mile radius in east Cleveland.

282
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:19,544
This small zone indicates that's he's
a geographically stable offender.

283
00:18:19,884 --> 00:18:22,430
This type of offender is
characterized as young,

284
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,766
socially immature, of
average intelligence,

285
00:18:24,891 --> 00:18:27,080
with psychopathic personality traits.

286
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:30,001
They also usually live alone
and have an antisocial nature.

287
00:18:30,126 --> 00:18:32,693
A serial killer's first
murder is very telling.

288
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:34,769
This unsub's first murder,
he chose the m. o.

289
00:18:34,894 --> 00:18:37,473
of Cleveland's own
butcher of Kingsbury run.

290
00:18:37,598 --> 00:18:40,065
The butcher isn't as well known
as other famous serial killers,

291
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,943
but he is a local legend.

292
00:18:42,194 --> 00:18:45,164
And because he picked the butcher,
we believe he's a native of Cleveland

293
00:18:45,428 --> 00:18:47,541
and probably grew up hearing
stories of the butcher.

294
00:18:47,666 --> 00:18:50,169
This is someone who is obsessed
with serial killers.

295
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,043
His PC will be filled with research.

296
00:18:52,168 --> 00:18:54,387
He'll have abundant images
of murderers on his computer

297
00:18:54,512 --> 00:18:56,091
and possibly even snuff films.

298
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:58,212
He uses these like pornography.

299
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:01,639
They provide some sort
of sexual release.

300
00:19:17,585 --> 00:19:20,032
I think he went back
to relive his crime.

301
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:23,440
When Zoe showed up,
she became a victim of opportunity.

302
00:19:23,565 --> 00:19:25,777
It's the same theory
we arrived at on the plane.

303
00:19:25,902 --> 00:19:27,679
He strangled her with her own scarf.

304
00:19:27,804 --> 00:19:30,008
He didn't plan it.
I think she surprised him.

305
00:19:31,527 --> 00:19:32,527
I told her

306
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:36,265
not to stop until she found the answers
she was looking for.

307
00:19:37,417 --> 00:19:39,468
I didn't think she would
go to a crime scene.

308
00:19:39,742 --> 00:19:41,593
Her mom said 
that she that does all the time.

309
00:19:41,718 --> 00:19:43,524
She probably would have gone anyway.

310
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,042
But it's because of what I said

311
00:19:45,167 --> 00:19:47,309
that she was encouraged
to go there last night.

312
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,281
What are you doing?

313
00:19:49,406 --> 00:19:51,302
She came to me and I dismissed her.

314
00:19:52,303 --> 00:19:53,774
Try not to personalize it.

315
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:58,610
I was the last one she talked to
before she was murdered.

316
00:19:59,152 --> 00:20:01,150
How is this not personal, Aaron?

317
00:20:04,751 --> 00:20:05,951
It's personal.

318
00:20:06,418 --> 00:20:09,415
That doesn't change how we go
about finding her killer.

319
00:20:12,065 --> 00:20:15,671
We know that violent criminals develop
a signature over a series of crimes.

320
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,882
If he's young, he probably hasn't
even figured out what his is yet.

321
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:23,341
Find the signature,
we can link the crimes.

322
00:20:23,466 --> 00:20:26,598
He probably monitoring the news, seeing
if the police have connected them yet.

323
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:29,340
We can use that.
We can utilize the media.

324
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:31,479
And I think I know
who we can talk to.

325
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:46,743
I knew homicides were up, but nobody
said anything about a serial killer.

326
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,789
Why do I get a visit from the b.a.u.?

327
00:20:51,175 --> 00:20:54,154
You're Paula McConnell, Cleveland's #1
source in crime news.

328
00:20:54,279 --> 00:20:57,045
You're detailed, you have a following.
He's reading you.

329
00:20:57,491 --> 00:21:00,340
We need you to write that the police
have found his signature.

330
00:21:00,535 --> 00:21:03,093
You can help us by explaining
what his signature is in your article.

331
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:06,044
It's a killer's personal stamp,
his distinctive touch that he leaves

332
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:07,898
at the scene of every crime.

333
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:11,519
I've been doing this for 18 years.
And I know what a signature is, honey.

334
00:21:13,288 --> 00:21:15,439
We really need you
to be detailed about this.

335
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:17,482
We're speaking directly to him.

336
00:21:19,036 --> 00:21:21,298
- Through my column.
- He's doing something,

337
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:24,323
a behavioral impulse
he feels compelled to do.

338
00:21:24,689 --> 00:21:27,493
But a need-driven act
to get a sexual release

339
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:29,734
that's specific to his psyche.

340
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:33,071
This repetitive behavior at each
crime scene will lead us to him.

341
00:21:33,405 --> 00:21:35,155
Let me take a stab at it.

342
00:21:39,183 --> 00:21:41,023
They just found another body.

343
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:49,640
They're bringing him up right now.

344
00:21:51,086 --> 00:21:53,352
Teenagers found him
a little over an hour ago.

345
00:21:54,884 --> 00:21:57,190
It's petechiae in the whites of his eyes.

346
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:01,777
Judging from the bruising,
he was probably strangled with a wire.

347
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:03,793
- Is this our guy?
- It's gotta be.

348
00:22:03,918 --> 00:22:05,871
A jogger doesn't get garroted
every day.

349
00:22:05,996 --> 00:22:08,867
Whatever signature he left was
probably washed away in the water.

350
00:22:09,313 --> 00:22:10,702
Who's he mimicking now?

351
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,803
Bike path rapist Altemio Sanchez
comes to mind.

352
00:22:13,928 --> 00:22:16,414
He trolled bike paths near
buffalo garroting his victims.

353
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:18,933
It looks like he copied
everything except for the rape.

354
00:22:19,058 --> 00:22:21,787
Strangulation's a repetition
of his last murder of Zoe.

355
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:25,456
- First time he's repeated himself.
- Zoe's murder was spontaneous, though.

356
00:22:25,581 --> 00:22:28,855
He didn't plan it. He acted on instinct
and did what came naturally to him.

357
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,632
Maybe what came naturally felt good
to him and he wanted to feel it again.

358
00:22:31,757 --> 00:22:34,678
If he's starting to repeat a pattern,
he may have found himself.

359
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,174
H-a-w-k-e-s.

360
00:23:06,936 --> 00:23:08,011
Very good.

361
00:23:10,066 --> 00:23:11,379
I'm Danny.

362
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:14,808
I want you to call us
if you have any questions at all.

363
00:23:15,945 --> 00:23:17,811
We're gonna take great care of her.

364
00:23:20,265 --> 00:23:21,270
You're all set.

365
00:23:21,395 --> 00:23:23,484
Do I pay the bill here?

366
00:23:24,101 --> 00:23:27,321
No, ma'am. The bill's been taken
care of by an anonymous donor.

367
00:23:32,984 --> 00:23:34,195
Anything else in there?

368
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,020
Just the notations of
an observant student.

369
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,067
I've been thinking, though.

370
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:41,430
Zoe got all of her information
from the newspapers

371
00:23:41,555 --> 00:23:43,253
and from Paula McConnell's column.

372
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,387
There's no way she could have known
about every homicide in the city.

373
00:23:46,512 --> 00:23:48,383
Not every homicide's
reported in the papers.

374
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:51,595
So how do we know he didn't commit more
murders than the ones in her journals?

375
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:52,680
We don't.

376
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:55,223
We can check missing
persons and see if anyone

377
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,843
was last seen
in the unsub's operating zone.

378
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:01,689
What?

379
00:24:01,814 --> 00:24:04,256
Well, a young person's
mind is so active...

380
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:07,277
yours, Zoe's,
and I imagine this unsub's, too.

381
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:10,781
I think when we get him, he'll be
curious. He'll ask questions.

382
00:24:11,687 --> 00:24:13,201
Rossi, heads up. She knows.

383
00:24:15,491 --> 00:24:16,661
Did you do this?

384
00:24:18,414 --> 00:24:19,581
I don't need

385
00:24:20,127 --> 00:24:21,897
or want your money.

386
00:24:22,716 --> 00:24:25,610
I have taken care of my
daughter for 22 years,

387
00:24:25,735 --> 00:24:28,132
and she is still my responsibility.

388
00:24:28,257 --> 00:24:30,676
I don't need any help from you.

389
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:34,846
You didn't even know her.

390
00:24:35,904 --> 00:24:37,558
I'm sorry if I've offended you.

391
00:24:40,318 --> 00:24:42,522
Just leave us alone.

392
00:24:49,473 --> 00:24:50,362
All right.

393
00:24:51,083 --> 00:24:52,493
We found another body.

394
00:24:52,618 --> 00:24:53,868
East Cleveland.

395
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,951
Strangulation marks.

396
00:24:57,491 --> 00:24:58,611
This was recent.

397
00:24:58,736 --> 00:25:00,940
The bruises on her neck
are still reddish.

398
00:25:01,659 --> 00:25:03,453
No other obvious signs of trauma.

399
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:05,877
Well, this isn't a bike
path like the last one.

400
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,937
Which serial killer is he mimicking now?

401
00:25:08,062 --> 00:25:11,299
I don't think he is mimicking anymore.
He's starting to show consistency.

402
00:25:11,859 --> 00:25:14,929
- I think he's developing his own style.
- Has anybody touched her?

403
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,555
No. They have instructions
to wait for us and the m.e.

404
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,491
- Where's he?
- Dr. Edwards!

405
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:23,354
Here he comes.

406
00:25:25,996 --> 00:25:28,485
Could you take a look
at this spot on her forehead?

407
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,823
Strange. Let me swab it
and get it back to the lab.

408
00:25:38,314 --> 00:25:41,122
3 murders in the last 3 days.
Something's causing his frenzy.

409
00:25:41,468 --> 00:25:45,125
Could be a drastic change in his life.
Something he lost control of.

410
00:25:45,597 --> 00:25:49,114
Or it could be something
he gained control of.

411
00:25:49,239 --> 00:25:50,388
Like himself.

412
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:54,085
If he's finally defined
himself as a strangler,

413
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:57,221
he may just be practicing,
perfecting his style.

414
00:25:57,346 --> 00:25:58,849
He may have awakened.

415
00:25:59,048 --> 00:26:00,432
The coroner just called.

416
00:26:00,682 --> 00:26:04,018
Preliminary tests confirm acetyl alcohol
on the homeless woman's forehead.

417
00:26:04,723 --> 00:26:07,144
- He sterilized it?
- Why would he do that?

418
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:11,569
Maybe he did something to her forehead,
used an alcohol wipe to remove evidence.

419
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:14,627
If that's the case, it certainly
wasn't necessary to the crime.

420
00:26:14,752 --> 00:26:16,682
This could be part of his signature.

421
00:26:16,807 --> 00:26:19,721
We should look at other victims
to see if he did something similar.

422
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:22,670
Any evidence on the last victim
was washed away in the water.

423
00:26:22,921 --> 00:26:25,934
And all the other bodies were
either buried or cremated.

424
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:27,309
Except for one.

425
00:26:37,489 --> 00:26:40,550
I know you don't want to see me,
but please hear me out.

426
00:26:40,675 --> 00:26:43,266
We need Zoe's body to go
back to the coroner's office.

427
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:46,269
Zoe's murderer left a clue on her body.

428
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,147
There's a chance we can
find him from this clue,

429
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:51,247
but we have to examine her again.

430
00:26:51,372 --> 00:26:54,522
All I want to do is put her to rest.

431
00:26:54,647 --> 00:26:56,907
Zoe chose to study criminology

432
00:26:57,775 --> 00:27:00,785
because she believed in
bringing criminals to justice.

433
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:09,338
Can't guarantee the evidence
hasn't been compromised.

434
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,476
The mortician
hadn't touched her yet.

435
00:27:11,601 --> 00:27:14,839
Even so, she's been transported
more times than I'd like.

436
00:27:15,172 --> 00:27:16,981
Don't want anyone
to get their hopes up.

437
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:19,847
Just make sure the evidence
gets to Quantico quickly.

438
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,257
<i>East Cleveland homicides,
first quarter to date...</i>

439
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,998
<i>5 out of 9 unsolved.</i>

440
00:27:25,123 --> 00:27:28,747
<i>January 22... prostitute murder
downtown at 5th and main.</i>

441
00:27:28,872 --> 00:27:31,978
<i>January 9... man shot at Kingsbury park.</i>

442
00:27:32,103 --> 00:27:35,551
<i>February 15... Kayla James. Lived alone.</i>

443
00:27:35,676 --> 00:27:37,855
<i>First home invasion...
february 8... murder...</i>

444
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,358
<i>young couple shot in park.
No apparent motive.</i>

445
00:27:40,915 --> 00:27:42,743
<i>Investigate.
Why are locations different?</i>

446
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:45,746
Page 47, Rossi's book:
"There are no coincidences".

447
00:27:50,622 --> 00:27:52,086
Garcia, you got something?

448
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,319
The boys in the lab found trace
amounts of saliva on Zoe's forehead,

449
00:27:55,444 --> 00:27:56,757
enough for a DNA sample.

450
00:27:56,882 --> 00:27:59,092
So we got a codis match
on Eric Ryan Olson,

451
00:27:59,516 --> 00:28:02,722
23, Cleveland native, did 2 1/2 years
for attempted sexual assault

452
00:28:03,008 --> 00:28:04,709
<i>and was paroled 6 months ago.</i>

453
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,599
We thought for sure he'd be a student.

454
00:28:06,828 --> 00:28:09,067
That's 'cause he was.
While he was in the slammer,

455
00:28:09,192 --> 00:28:11,521
he took independent
correspondence classes

456
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,482
in forensic science and criminology
from an out-of-state school.

457
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:16,442
Call the team.
Let's get a search warrant.

458
00:28:24,001 --> 00:28:24,961
Clear!

459
00:28:25,086 --> 00:28:26,086
Clear!

460
00:28:26,886 --> 00:28:27,937
Reid, the computer.

461
00:28:28,062 --> 00:28:30,028
We should ask the neighbors,

462
00:28:30,153 --> 00:28:32,185
where he might be on a week night.

463
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:34,462
He's reading my books.

464
00:28:50,151 --> 00:28:51,604
Reid, anything?

465
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,028
Al's alehouse. That's like 5 miles away.

466
00:28:59,153 --> 00:29:01,303
It's on the schedule for tonight.

467
00:29:03,903 --> 00:29:06,453
- Have a good night.
- See you tomorrow.

468
00:29:29,027 --> 00:29:31,389
- He was alone at the bar.
- When did he leave?

469
00:29:31,514 --> 00:29:34,414
- Like 10 minutes ago.
- Did he talk to anyone?

470
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:38,484
He left right after she did.

471
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:56,168
Got it, Hotch. Manager says

472
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,399
he may have followed
one of the waitresses.

473
00:29:58,524 --> 00:30:01,214
- She walks home through Cedar park.
- We just passed Cedar park.

474
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:19,766
Get off the girl!

475
00:30:20,143 --> 00:30:21,581
Stay down! Stay down!

476
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,416
- Get off me.
- Wait.

477
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:25,291
- Get off me!
- Hold on.

478
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,240
Stop! We're trying to help you.

479
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:29,167
He's my boyfriend!

480
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:40,712
- Didn't see that coming.
- How could she not know?

481
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:44,215
Kenneth Bianchi's girlfriendhad no idea
he was one of the hillside stranglers.

482
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:46,842
Just like BTK's wife.

483
00:30:47,406 --> 00:30:49,972
- What do we know about her?
- Her name's Linda Jones.

484
00:30:50,307 --> 00:30:52,598
No criminal record.
They met online 6 weeks ago.

485
00:30:54,908 --> 00:30:56,697
No, he can't be this guy.

486
00:30:57,223 --> 00:30:59,105
We found his DNA on a murder victim.

487
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:02,359
- What?
- We also think he's responsible

488
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,152
for the murder of 7 other people
over the last 7 weeks.

489
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:07,748
Two of his victims were raped.

490
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:11,951
I think I'm gonna be sick.

491
00:31:21,007 --> 00:31:24,355
Against my counsel, my client would like
to talk to agent Rossi.

492
00:31:27,608 --> 00:31:29,880
We talked about him being
curious, asking questions.

493
00:31:30,005 --> 00:31:32,302
If he thinks he knows
you, he might open up.

494
00:31:32,531 --> 00:31:34,399
- I'll keep him talking.
- Good.

495
00:31:42,917 --> 00:31:43,917
Big fan.

496
00:31:46,524 --> 00:31:49,030
We have some information
that would be of great interest to you.

497
00:31:50,779 --> 00:31:52,279
My ears are burning.

498
00:31:53,308 --> 00:31:56,483
My lawyer here explains
that I'm being charged with 8 murders

499
00:31:56,608 --> 00:31:59,086
and that I'm probably
looking at the death penalty.

500
00:31:59,211 --> 00:32:01,125
I have one very important
question for you.

501
00:32:02,651 --> 00:32:04,964
Are you sure it's just 8?

502
00:32:07,278 --> 00:32:08,258
What?

503
00:32:08,657 --> 00:32:10,050
We checked missing persons.

504
00:32:10,413 --> 00:32:12,689
Since he started killing,
4 people have been reported missing

505
00:32:12,814 --> 00:32:14,316
in east Cleveland neighborhoods.

506
00:32:14,441 --> 00:32:16,597
We can't rule out any of
them as his possible victims.

507
00:32:16,722 --> 00:32:18,476
He marked pages on
several serial killers.

508
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:20,311
We ignore which ones
he tried to copycat.

509
00:32:20,436 --> 00:32:21,449
We're screwed.

510
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:25,129
- The d.a. will offer him a deal.
- He doesn't have to.

511
00:32:25,254 --> 00:32:28,165
That's easy for you to say.
You get to go home tomorrow.

512
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:30,128
What do I tell
the families of the missing?

513
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:31,414
Sorry, no idea?

514
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:32,843
We're not gonna leave

515
00:32:32,968 --> 00:32:35,284
until we can give you and
the families some closure.

516
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:37,613
And how are you gonna do that?

517
00:32:39,755 --> 00:32:43,501
I need anything that might show
where he was trolling for more victims.

518
00:32:43,874 --> 00:32:46,723
Once the d.a. gets here,
we have a lot to talk about.

519
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,786
What do you think
you're gonna get out of this?

520
00:32:49,911 --> 00:32:51,061
I don't know.

521
00:32:51,384 --> 00:32:52,480
We'll see.

522
00:32:52,605 --> 00:32:54,552
You don't have to say
anything else, Eric.

523
00:32:54,677 --> 00:32:57,765
You got to speak to him.
Now let's just wait for the d.a.

524
00:32:58,525 --> 00:33:01,905
I don't know how to break it to you,
but you don't have a card to play here.

525
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:04,489
We're 3 steps ahead of you.

526
00:33:06,839 --> 00:33:07,650
Really.

527
00:33:07,775 --> 00:33:11,748
We've already considered the possibility
that you killed other people.

528
00:33:12,301 --> 00:33:14,584
We knew you were young,
wanted to experiment.

529
00:33:15,146 --> 00:33:18,422
It was likely you would copycat
as many serial killers as possible

530
00:33:18,547 --> 00:33:20,424
to figure out who you are

531
00:33:20,549 --> 00:33:21,999
and what you liked.

532
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:25,766
So let me ask you a question.

533
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,448
How do you know

534
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,640
you haven't told me already

535
00:33:30,765 --> 00:33:32,801
where the other bodies are buried?

536
00:33:39,403 --> 00:33:42,387
- We've been through everything.
- He marked up Rossi's books. Check it.

537
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:45,332
Maybe he was scouting for locations
to commit more murders.

538
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:50,003
- Pictures.
- What?

539
00:33:50,432 --> 00:33:52,506
Framed photographs in his hallway.

540
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,999
Nothing else... nothing else is framed.

541
00:33:55,124 --> 00:33:57,866
They look like originals. Let
me call you right back, Hotch.

542
00:34:02,664 --> 00:34:04,971
I need to ask you about your sex life.

543
00:34:06,757 --> 00:34:09,806
- That's personal.
- Your boyfriend's a serial killer.

544
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:12,575
Your relationship is no longer private.

545
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:18,092
It's completely normal
to experiment with sex.

546
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:20,575
OK. It might be normal to
have sex in a public park,

547
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:22,016
but the other things?

548
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,122
We were just role-playing.

549
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:27,635
Every couple has fantasies.

550
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,752
Did you ever think it was strange
that your boyfriend has fantasies

551
00:34:30,877 --> 00:34:32,568
about strangling and raping women?

552
00:34:32,868 --> 00:34:34,135
Not women.

553
00:34:35,369 --> 00:34:36,369
Just me.

554
00:34:42,266 --> 00:34:45,123
Did he... kiss you
on the forehead, too?

555
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:50,129
How did you know that?

556
00:34:52,921 --> 00:34:54,759
Were you sick much as a kid?

557
00:34:56,573 --> 00:34:58,766
I got strep throat every flu season.

558
00:35:00,637 --> 00:35:02,499
Did you just profile that about me?

559
00:35:02,624 --> 00:35:06,613
Her name was Zoe Hawkes...
the girl you killed 3 days ago.

560
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:10,867
- We found your DNA on her forehead.
- It'll never be admissible in court.

561
00:35:11,216 --> 00:35:13,339
Her body was removed
from a state facility and...

562
00:35:13,464 --> 00:35:15,867
now, most people would ask
what you did.

563
00:35:16,723 --> 00:35:18,319
I know what you did.

564
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:20,422
You kissed her on the forehead.

565
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:23,412
What I want to know is, why?

566
00:35:27,499 --> 00:35:29,875
Why do you think someone
would do that, agent Rossi?

567
00:35:30,942 --> 00:35:35,169
Well, that's why I asked
if you had been ill much as a child.

568
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:38,560
You see, you're slight,
pale, sickly.

569
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,065
Most parents, they kiss
their children on the forehead

570
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:44,081
to see if their temperature is warm.

571
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:47,571
Now, my theory is that you,
somehow in your development,

572
00:35:48,472 --> 00:35:52,399
warped that caring gesture
into something perverse.

573
00:35:55,302 --> 00:35:57,714
So, did you sit next to Zoe

574
00:35:58,323 --> 00:35:59,973
to see if she got cold?

575
00:36:01,783 --> 00:36:03,633
Is that why you kissed her?

576
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,075
That's a really interesting theory.

577
00:36:07,977 --> 00:36:10,499
Make a great chapter
in one of your books.

578
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:18,077
I found pictures on his computer
in a special folder he created.

579
00:36:18,202 --> 00:36:22,094
They're places in the city. 3 of them
I recognize from his crime scenes.

580
00:36:22,576 --> 00:36:24,763
There are more pictures
of places I don't recognize.

581
00:36:25,328 --> 00:36:28,600
- Email them as soon as you can.
- This guy's getting off on those photos.

582
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:31,279
Then what does he need Linda for?

583
00:36:31,404 --> 00:36:33,950
Did he have any other
strange preferences in bed?

584
00:36:36,242 --> 00:36:38,434
Did he ever role play
by tying you up?

585
00:36:39,855 --> 00:36:41,406
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

586
00:36:43,506 --> 00:36:44,506
I'm sure.

587
00:36:47,645 --> 00:36:50,054
He liked... he liked
being an exhibitionist.

588
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,209
It was really the only way
he could get excited.

589
00:36:54,891 --> 00:36:56,254
What do you mean?

590
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,275
Well, he didn't... like...

591
00:36:58,976 --> 00:37:00,660
having sex in bed.

592
00:37:01,768 --> 00:37:03,001
So he just

593
00:37:03,828 --> 00:37:05,608
took me to public places.

594
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:06,670
Where?

595
00:37:09,402 --> 00:37:11,171
Do I have to tell you this?

596
00:37:17,161 --> 00:37:18,962
The first time was...

597
00:37:19,782 --> 00:37:21,028
at Kingsbury park.

598
00:37:22,703 --> 00:37:23,753
And then...

599
00:37:24,906 --> 00:37:26,356
at a movie theater.

600
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,911
In the parking lot, in my car.

601
00:37:30,407 --> 00:37:34,062
Did he ever take you to the 2d street
bridge, off the bike path?

602
00:37:38,318 --> 00:37:40,132
That's where the jogger was killed.

603
00:37:40,417 --> 00:37:43,280
He can only have sex with Linda
when he's revisiting his crimes.

604
00:37:43,405 --> 00:37:47,409
If that's the case, what were they doing
in the park where we picked them up?

605
00:37:51,897 --> 00:37:55,117
I need you to write down for me
all the places he took you to have sex.

606
00:38:05,945 --> 00:38:08,241
The d.a.'s not gonna need
to negotiate a deal with you.

607
00:38:17,298 --> 00:38:19,086
Cedar park, Edgewater channel,

608
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:22,048
Cuyahoga valley park, Euclid creek.

609
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:28,095
We'll send units in the morning
to search for the bodies.

610
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,383
How'd you find out?

611
00:38:34,627 --> 00:38:36,169
Is it something that I did?

612
00:38:36,294 --> 00:38:38,758
You needed to revisit
the crime scenes

613
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,151
because it was the only way for you
to get a gratifying sexual release.

614
00:38:45,011 --> 00:38:47,200
But revisiting the scenes wasn't enough.

615
00:38:47,689 --> 00:38:49,442
You had to capture it on film,

616
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:51,465
put it on your computer,

617
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,290
display it on your wall,

618
00:38:54,479 --> 00:38:56,582
so you could look at it every day.

619
00:38:58,449 --> 00:39:00,127
Eric, we should talk privately.

620
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:02,171
This isn't over.

621
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:09,723
I always knew
I'd end up back in prison.

622
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,014
Just a matter of when.

623
00:39:13,363 --> 00:39:15,578
You can come interview me
if you want.

624
00:39:16,476 --> 00:39:19,688
I read in one of your books that's how
you built your behavioral database.

625
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,709
<i>Maybe you can learn
something from me.</i>

626
00:39:26,162 --> 00:39:28,215
<i>I got a lot of questions myself.</i>

627
00:39:30,829 --> 00:39:33,220
<i>I'll be honest with you
if you're honest with me.</i>

628
00:39:35,982 --> 00:39:39,334
'cause the one thing that you always ask
is the one that I don't understand.

629
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:42,838
Why?

630
00:39:44,988 --> 00:39:46,438
<i>I have no idea why.</i>

631
00:39:48,213 --> 00:39:49,843
I see a guy walking down the street

632
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:52,637
<i>with a stupid look on his face</i>

633
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,990
<i>and I want to bash him
over the head with a bottle,</i>

634
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:58,476
to me that's normal.

635
00:40:01,089 --> 00:40:03,607
It's weird to me that no
one else feels that way.

636
00:40:06,637 --> 00:40:08,287
It's all I think about.

637
00:40:09,503 --> 00:40:10,653
I can't stop.

638
00:40:39,987 --> 00:40:41,999
This is not up for debate.

639
00:40:42,124 --> 00:40:44,167
Cancel the rest of the dates.

640
00:40:44,934 --> 00:40:46,284
Is everything OK?

641
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,973
Why do people want to hear
me talk about serial killers?

642
00:40:50,098 --> 00:40:51,776
Is it that entertaining?

643
00:40:51,901 --> 00:40:53,656
There's a public fascination
with them.

644
00:40:54,129 --> 00:40:57,245
Sometimes I wonder if my books
are doing more harm than good.

645
00:40:57,864 --> 00:40:59,760
My senior year at Georgetown...

646
00:40:59,885 --> 00:41:02,007
I was graduating,
I did not have a clue

647
00:41:02,132 --> 00:41:03,925
what I was gonna do with my life.

648
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,189
And one day I was in
the campus bookstore

649
00:41:06,314 --> 00:41:07,881
and you were there,

650
00:41:08,525 --> 00:41:10,132
promoting your second book.

651
00:41:10,881 --> 00:41:12,427
Sat through your whole talk.

652
00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:14,888
You never told me.

653
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:17,854
I asked you what it was
you were most proud of,

654
00:41:17,979 --> 00:41:21,254
and you showed us a picture
of a boy from Charleston.

655
00:41:22,293 --> 00:41:23,591
Brent Roberts.

656
00:41:23,808 --> 00:41:24,976
A neighbor took him.

657
00:41:25,101 --> 00:41:26,489
He was found alive.

658
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:27,690
One of the few.

659
00:41:29,696 --> 00:41:31,464
That night, I bought your book.

660
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:34,366
Applied to the academy the next fall.

661
00:41:39,325 --> 00:41:40,829
I'll see you at the airport.

662
00:41:50,075 --> 00:41:53,439
<i>Austrian novelist
Marie Von Ebner-Eschenbach wrote:</i>

663
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,564
<i>"In youth we learn.</i>

664
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,638
<i>"In age we understand."</i>

665
00:42:08,156 --> 00:42:09,756
I hear you caught him.

666
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:14,427
We did.

667
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:17,365
Is he going to prison?

668
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:19,827
For the rest of his life.

669
00:42:23,933 --> 00:42:25,725
It doesn't make me feel better.

670
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,377
He's alive, Zoe's not.

671
00:42:31,083 --> 00:42:33,507
But she'd be pleased
that you caught him.

672
00:42:38,001 --> 00:42:38,955
I hope so.
