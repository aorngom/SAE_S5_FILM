1
00:01:01,172 --> 00:01:02,144
Look at you.

2
00:01:03,448 --> 00:01:06,181
- Sorry I'm wet. I'm...
- I'm sorry to make you drive in this.

3
00:01:06,306 --> 00:01:07,874
It sounded urgent.

4
00:01:08,283 --> 00:01:09,888
It's really good to see you.

5
00:01:10,324 --> 00:01:11,630
It's been forever.

6
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,615
Johnny, what's goin' on?

7
00:01:15,665 --> 00:01:17,092
It's about Matthew.

8
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,120
- Benton?
- He's dead.

9
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:25,456
I didn't wanna tell you
over the phone.

10
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:29,609
How?

11
00:01:31,003 --> 00:01:33,759
His parents said
that he had a heart attack.

12
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,262
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,141
- Had you seen him?
- Yeah.

14
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:42,205
A couple of times.

15
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:44,353
- How was he?
- He was Matthew.

16
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:46,355
He was rambling, a little chaotic.

17
00:01:47,686 --> 00:01:49,650
- He was using.
- I don't know.

18
00:01:50,117 --> 00:01:51,117
Probably.

19
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,853
There's something
you're not telling me.

20
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:03,935
The last time I saw him,
there was somethin' different.

21
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,254
He was talkin' crazy, but the...

22
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,629
the fear... I can't quite explain it,
but I know it was real.

23
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,165
What was he saying?

24
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:14,341
He said,
"Johnny, they're gonna kill me."

25
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,545
- Who's "they"?
- He wouldn't say.

26
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,680
He said they already murdered
a guy from Georgetown named Tommy "V"

27
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,768
- and made it look like an accident.
- Do you know anyone named Tommy "V"?

28
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:26,645
Look, he's probably
just being paranoid,

29
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:29,565
but with what you do
for a living now...

30
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:32,818
You're one of the only people
he ever trusted.

31
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:54,235
My lord, it's kitties
and poodles out there.

32
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,269
- Did you hear it might even snow?
- Can you find anything on Tommy "V"?

33
00:02:58,394 --> 00:03:00,304
If by chance you mean
Thomas Valentine, age 35,

34
00:03:00,473 --> 00:03:03,214
found dead in his home
from dehydration, as a matter of...

35
00:03:03,921 --> 00:03:05,893
- what's going on?
- Is Hotch still here?

36
00:03:06,244 --> 00:03:08,312
- I'm pretty sure he lives here.
- Thanks.

37
00:03:17,995 --> 00:03:19,145
What's wrong?

38
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,345
I just found out that...

39
00:03:24,484 --> 00:03:25,788
An old friend of mine died.

40
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:28,621
I'm sorry.

41
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,738
Do you need to take some time?

42
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:42,124
There's a chance
that he could have been murdered,

43
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:44,804
and there might be a second case.

44
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,735
What do you need?

45
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,812
- Just some leeway to check it out.
- Of course.

46
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:51,271
Anything.

47
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,870
Thank you.

48
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:56,754
Emily, if you wanna take a few days
and let us look into it...

49
00:03:59,487 --> 00:04:00,614
Matthew was...

50
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:06,164
incredibly messed up,
and I hadn't seen him in a long time,

51
00:04:07,641 --> 00:04:09,340
but he was important to me.

52
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,429
At least let us help.

53
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,300
Thank you.

54
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,762
Leonardo Da Vinci said,

55
00:05:23,887 --> 00:05:26,977
"he who does not punish evil
commands it to be done."

56
00:05:27,102 --> 00:05:29,425
- Thanks for coming in early.
- Where's Morgan and Prentiss?

57
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:31,279
They're at the morgue
examining this man,

58
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:33,768
Matthew Benton, a friend of Emily's.
She believes that his death

59
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,627
- may be connected to that man's.
- Thomas Valentine.

60
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:38,545
Dehydration?

61
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,673
- Did she know him?
- No,

62
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,245
but Benton seemed to think
that someone was after both of them.

63
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,877
One death was a heart attack.
The other was from dehydration.

64
00:05:46,002 --> 00:05:48,289
- What's the connection?
- I don't know if there is one.

65
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:50,548
- Are the police investigating?
- No, right now,

66
00:05:50,673 --> 00:05:52,851
- we're just helping a colleague.
- So we talk

67
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,628
to the families,
see if there's anything suspicious.

68
00:05:55,796 --> 00:05:57,481
- Is Emily OK?
- I don't know.

69
00:05:57,943 --> 00:06:00,074
That's why I sent Morgan
to go with her.

70
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:15,186
I'm scared.

71
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:17,560
Don't worry.

72
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,462
It'll be all right.

73
00:06:19,932 --> 00:06:21,088
Hold my hand?

74
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:22,970
Always.

75
00:06:26,382 --> 00:06:28,825
Is it possible someone
could have induced the heart attack?

76
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,835
The easiest way to stop the heart
is an injection of potassium.

77
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,625
- I would have found traces.
- There's no other way?

78
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,396
I suppose it's possible he could
have been injected with epinephrine.

79
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,953
It wouldn't register,

80
00:06:39,078 --> 00:06:42,651
because clinically, it's identical
to the natural adrenalin in the body.

81
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,279
- Was he tied?
- The wounds are superficial.

82
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,095
Anything else out of the ordinary?

83
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,577
He bled heavily from his nose,
but with the damage to his septum,

84
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:55,338
My guess is that it was prolonged abuse
of cocaine or methamphetamine.

85
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,333
- and what about the other autopsy?
- He died of dehydration.

86
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,129
There were traces of prescription
antipsychotics in his system.

87
00:07:02,624 --> 00:07:05,048
I understand from his family,
he had a history of mental illness.

88
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:07,009
- Are these ligature marks?
- Considering

89
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:09,682
the self-inflicted wounds
and the history of mental illness,

90
00:07:09,807 --> 00:07:11,346
the police didn't suspect foul play.

91
00:07:11,515 --> 00:07:14,325
So you have 2 bodies
with ligature marks...

92
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:17,203
- Each superficial.
- But you just dismiss them?

93
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,030
There's no medical reason
to connect these deaths.

94
00:07:27,256 --> 00:07:30,465
I don't understand why the FBI
is interested in our son's death.

95
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,595
We were investigating another death
recently under similar circumstances,

96
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,135
And we just wanted to make sure
that there's no connection.

97
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,374
- He suffered a heart attack.
- It's just routine.

98
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,465
There's nothing routine
about investigating a heart attack.

99
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,890
Andrea, it's OK.

100
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,633
I assume your investigation
is drug-related.

101
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,054
We're just trying
to rule out foul play.

102
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:53,574
May we come in?

103
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:56,842
Of course.

104
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:07,125
When I came in the house,
I found him here in bed.

105
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:10,446
- You two don't live together?
- I'd taken the kids to my mom's.

106
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,366
We'd been gone a few weeks.

107
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,315
The doctor said he must
have been in bed for days.

108
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,444
May I ask why you took the
children somewhere else to live?

109
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,666
My husband was hearing voices.

110
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,250
He was cursing God.

111
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:25,405
I needed to protect them.

112
00:08:25,637 --> 00:08:26,797
Of course.

113
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:28,340
Do you believe in the soul?

114
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,301
I do.

115
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,097
Well, I believe Tommy's
is finally at peace.

116
00:08:40,096 --> 00:08:42,485
Do you mind my asking
if you've been burning incense?

117
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:45,135
After Matthew died,
I burned some in the room

118
00:08:45,799 --> 00:08:48,694
- to cleanse it.
- So he was living here with you?

119
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:51,613
We were hoping
he could turn his life around.

120
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:54,763
We were in New York for the weekend,
and when we came back,

121
00:08:54,888 --> 00:08:56,520
we found his body here.

122
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:01,957
My son's soul was
in the possession of evil.

123
00:09:04,054 --> 00:09:06,600
Do you have any experience
dealing with drug addiction?

124
00:09:06,725 --> 00:09:09,398
- We see a lot of it through our work.
- It's an impossible thing

125
00:09:09,523 --> 00:09:11,290
to watch happen to someone you love.

126
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,722
Were you aware
that in the days before he died,

127
00:09:13,847 --> 00:09:16,112
Matthew thought
someone was going to kill him?

128
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,015
Where did you hear that?

129
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:20,729
One of our team members,
agent Prentiss.

130
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,955
- Emily Prentiss?
- Yes, ma'am.

131
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,042
She's the reason you're here?

132
00:09:26,653 --> 00:09:28,066
We'd like you both to leave.

133
00:09:30,347 --> 00:09:31,195
Now.

134
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,015
I told you not to mention me.

135
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:43,085
You didn't say
it'd get us kicked out.

136
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,935
Is there something we should know?

137
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,480
Matthew and I met
in Rome when we were 15.

138
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:50,797
My mom was posted there.
His parents didn't like us hanging out.

139
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,425
- And they still hold a grudge?
- They were extremely religious.

140
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:57,007
- They thought I was a bad influence.
- You?

141
00:09:58,410 --> 00:09:59,572
And that's it?

142
00:10:00,015 --> 00:10:01,015
That's it.

143
00:10:05,371 --> 00:10:07,685
We saw scuff marks on the floor

144
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:09,455
underneath Thomas Valentine's bed,

145
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:13,125
Almost as if someone had been
tied up and struggled to get free.

146
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,645
We saw the exact same marks
in Matthew's bedroom.

147
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:18,605
Has anybody been able to find
any connection at all between them?

148
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,785
According to my snooping,
both Benton and Valentine

149
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,740
traveled to Galicia, Spain,

150
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,707
over the same week 4 months ago.

151
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:28,285
- That mean anything to you?
- No.

152
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,919
I did the quick guidebook thing.

153
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,355
There's a church there,
<i>Santiago de Compostela</i>.

154
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,049
It's visited by over 100,000
religious pilgrims every year.

155
00:10:35,218 --> 00:10:37,511
Did his parents say anything
about him going on a pilgrimage?

156
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,348
No, the opposite, actually. His mom
said his soul was possessed by evil.

157
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:43,571
What?

158
00:10:43,696 --> 00:10:45,852
Matthew had a thing
about challenging the church.

159
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,646
He could push it.

160
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,805
When we were in high school,
his mom and dad consulted a priest

161
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,720
Because they were afraid
he was possessed.

162
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:55,082
I think in this case,
she was talking about drugs.

163
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:57,726
Are you sure?
There's a pattern here.

164
00:10:57,851 --> 00:10:59,157
The talk about evil

165
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,952
and the soul
and scuff marks on the floor.

166
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:03,620
What are you driving at?

167
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,878
Drug addiction and schizophrenia

168
00:11:06,003 --> 00:11:09,710
are two afflictions most likely
to present as demonic possession.

169
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:13,110
- You think these were exorcisms.
- I think it begs the question.

170
00:11:13,235 --> 00:11:15,299
Look, I know the bible
just as well as anyone,

171
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,759
I know there's nothing more open to
behavioral interpretation than religion.

172
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,045
Meaning what?

173
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:23,265
I think it's dangerous for us to wanna
find a connection between these deaths.

174
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:25,865
Wait. Was Thomas' wife religious?

175
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,687
She was concerned
that he had been cursing god.

176
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,935
Exorcism ritual can
take days to complete.

177
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,725
It's possible the stress induced
could cause a heart attack,

178
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:36,803
Especially in someone
with a history of drug use.

179
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,725
That would explain the timeline
of someone dying of dehydration.

180
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,975
Look, I'm willing to say
that we might have an unsub

181
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:47,208
who ritualizes killings
as if they were exorcisms, maybe,

182
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,797
but right now, we don't know
if we have a crime yet.

183
00:11:49,922 --> 00:11:52,165
Morgan's right.
We need to step back.

184
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:56,294
Let me talk to someone before
I have us all telling ghost stories.

185
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,476
You know, they count
all that stuff, Jimmy.

186
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:09,799
Stranger.

187
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,805
I know. It's been too long.

188
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,400
So maybe after we speak,
you'll let me take your confession?

189
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,913
- Gonna strong-arm me?
- You bet.

190
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:20,989
So, how can I help you?

191
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,576
What do you know about exorcisms?

192
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,882
Well, they're controversial.

193
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,024
The Vatican issued a new...

194
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:36,095
exorcism rite in 1999,
so nobody speaks out against it,

195
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,711
but if pressed,

196
00:12:38,353 --> 00:12:39,453
not every...

197
00:12:39,885 --> 00:12:42,184
priest believes
in demonic possessions.

198
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:43,965
Do you?

199
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:46,973
Let me put it this way.
You believe that evil exists.

200
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,518
- I've seen it.
- So if children

201
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:52,979
are born innocent,
at what point does evil enter them?

202
00:12:54,929 --> 00:12:56,855
How common are exorcisms?

203
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,277
Conservatively,
I'd say 400 or 500 a year.

204
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:00,862
Has anyone died in one?

205
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,665
What's this about, Davey?

206
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:04,950
I'm looking
into the deaths of 2 men.

207
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,585
Both were troubled.

208
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:10,705
Each recently had made
the same pilgrimage to Galicia, Spain.

209
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,625
Each died within the last 2 weeks.

210
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:15,605
And why do you suspect exorcism?

211
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,483
Well, it's just a theory.

212
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,105
One of our agents
knew one of the men.

213
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,926
She was afraid there
might be some foul play.

214
00:13:23,234 --> 00:13:24,365
You agree?

215
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:27,615
Would you know
if one took place here in D.C.?

216
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,565
If it's sanctioned, probably.

217
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:30,690
If not?

218
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,353
Then it's not a true exorcism.

219
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:37,235
Thanks, Jimmy.

220
00:13:40,265 --> 00:13:41,265
The agent,

221
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:44,596
did the information
about the case come to her directly?

222
00:13:44,721 --> 00:13:45,490
Why?

223
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:49,076
You open yourselves up to...
understanding the worst monsters,

224
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,806
and you invite

225
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:52,488
evil into your lives.

226
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,958
It's a vulnerable position.

227
00:13:55,569 --> 00:13:56,460
Meaning what?

228
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:58,587
Take good care of her

229
00:13:58,983 --> 00:13:59,983
and you.

230
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:02,192
- Are you OK, buddy?
- I'm getting out.

231
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:05,710
- We're not even halfway there.
- I'm getting out.

232
00:15:09,019 --> 00:15:10,530
Man, close the door!

233
00:15:17,704 --> 00:15:19,454
<i>Holy virgin of virgins...</i>

234
00:15:23,152 --> 00:15:25,649
<i>All holy angels and archangels,</i>

235
00:15:25,774 --> 00:15:27,425
<i>all the orders of blessed spirits,</i>

236
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,554
<i>St. John the baptist, St. Joseph...</i>

237
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,902
- How the hell did you get in here?
- I'm here to help you.

238
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,865
Get the hell out of here.

239
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,839
I cast you out, unclean spirit...

240
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:52,318
I said get the hell out of here.

241
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,538
Do not lay hands on me.

242
00:16:08,383 --> 00:16:10,719
Garcia got a call.
38-year-old white male

243
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:13,025
found dead in his bed
by his <i>fiancée</i>.

244
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,065
- What's the connection?
- She ran the name.

245
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,819
Patrick Cavanaugh was in Galicia,

246
00:16:16,944 --> 00:16:18,893
the same week
as Thomas Valentine and Matthew.

247
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,920
- Do you know him?
- No.

248
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,240
- Seriously?
- Yeah. What can you tell us?

249
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:27,527
White male, been dead for hours.
Medics think it was a brain aneurism.

250
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:30,560
- You mind if we take a look?
- Knock yourselves out.

251
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:42,585
This is kind of startin'
to freak me out a little bit.

252
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,365
Let's figure out if we have a crime
before we start freakin' out.

253
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,735
- Obviously we have a crime.
- How does an unsub induce an aneurism?

254
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:50,424
Could be caused by stress.

255
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:52,432
Yeah, like if you were restrained
on a bed

256
00:16:52,557 --> 00:16:54,971
while someone tried to banish
the devil from their body.

257
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,307
All I'm sayin' is I think
we should go easy.

258
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,355
Can I help you?

259
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,859
We're with the FBI.
We're investigating a series

260
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:08,705
- of unexplained deaths.
- I don't understand.

261
00:17:09,124 --> 00:17:12,029
Had Patrick been acting
erratically lately?

262
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,448
He had a brain condition.

263
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:16,495
He was getting headaches,
wasn't acting like himself.

264
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,204
Were you aware of a trip
he took recently to Galicia, Spain?

265
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,086
There's a church
there called <i>Santiago de Compostela</i>

266
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:24,875
we think he may have visited.

267
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,406
My <i>fiancé</i> traveled a lot for work.
I don't know everywhere he went.

268
00:17:28,531 --> 00:17:31,549
With all due respect, ma'am, I don't
think you're telling us the truth.

269
00:17:32,604 --> 00:17:33,946
Excuse me?

270
00:17:34,667 --> 00:17:36,429
Did you believe
Patrick was possessed?

271
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:38,505
I'd like some privacy, please?

272
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,355
Was someone trying
to rid him of demons?

273
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,142
- Is that how he died?
- No.

274
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:44,437
You really believe
he had a brain condition?

275
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,064
- You need to go now.
- Because if you sanctioned an exorcism

276
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:49,815
and he died, I can press to make you
an accessory to murder.

277
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:51,820
That is enough. Stop it.

278
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:53,405
Let's go.

279
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,542
I apologize for the intrusion.

280
00:18:13,909 --> 00:18:16,511
- What happened?
- I think there may be a third victim.

281
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,520
Is that what you think?

282
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:21,676
I don't know.

283
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,558
We have ligature marks,

284
00:18:23,683 --> 00:18:26,415
the Spain connection,
and scuff marks under the bed.

285
00:18:27,368 --> 00:18:28,948
It's weird, definitely,

286
00:18:29,179 --> 00:18:31,234
but there's no way
to physically connect dehydration,

287
00:18:31,403 --> 00:18:33,175
a heart attack, and an aneurism.

288
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,465
- What's goin' on?
- We've had a complaint.

289
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,895
J.J.'s trying to smooth it over
with the D.C. police,

290
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,450
but we haven't been invited in
on the case.

291
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:44,998
That's how you have my back?

292
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,002
- Prentiss, I'm trying to protect you.
- I don't need protection.

293
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:51,755
Hotch said he got a complaint,
and he didn't come down on you.

294
00:18:51,924 --> 00:18:54,048
You realize that?
You just dodged a bullet.

295
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:56,551
We have to approach this
like we do any other case.

296
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:57,764
Meaning what?

297
00:18:57,889 --> 00:19:00,804
Grief can make us wanna believe there's
a reason for things when there's not.

298
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,871
That woman couldn't even use
Patrick's name.

299
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,333
She could only say, "<i>my fiancé</i>"?

300
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:10,481
Because she's convinced something else
died in that room that night.

301
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:27,875
As far as the police are concerned,
there is no open murder investigation.

302
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,055
We have no reason to be
investigating if they're not.

303
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,669
They're right.
All we have are three men who died

304
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:35,715
- in 3 very different natural deaths.
- So we just drop it?

305
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,015
Do you really believe we're dealing
with someone trying to exorcise demons?

306
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,685
It doesn't matter what I believe.

307
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:45,825
Possession, mental illness?
Exorcist, unsub?

308
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,135
Who cares what's true?
People are dying.

309
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,563
This isn't about religion.
It's about evil.

310
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:53,233
We attack it
with analysis and diligence.

311
00:19:53,401 --> 00:19:55,695
For this unsub,
it's a fight to the death.

312
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,425
All hail the mistress
of information.

313
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,485
- You got somethin'?
- You know I do.

314
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,108
It's a posting from a web bulletin board
by Matthew Benton

315
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:05,945
to create a support group for people
who felt betrayed by their faith.

316
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:08,225
That helps explain
how these 3 men came together.

317
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:11,164
It gets better.
The week the 3 of them were in Spain,

318
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:13,314
the services
at <i>Santiago de Compostela</i>

319
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,296
were canceled
when the priest there died.

320
00:20:15,658 --> 00:20:17,631
- Died how?
- Heart attack.

321
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,606
But if you listen to
the conspiracy chatter,

322
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:22,400
there is a strong belief
he was killed to interrupt services

323
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:24,825
- during the height of the pilgrimage.
- How?

324
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:27,584
Their best guess is some kind of gas,
Sarin or VX,

325
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:30,395
something that wouldn't show up
in an autopsy. But it could be anything

326
00:20:30,564 --> 00:20:32,355
would induce stress,
cause a heart attack.

327
00:20:32,523 --> 00:20:33,898
Then we have a motive.

328
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:36,276
And a potential M.O.,
an eye for an eye.

329
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:40,530
Without an invitation from the police,
I cannot authorize an investigation.

330
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,955
This has to be kept quiet.

331
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:54,377
- So the police are not investigating?
- Exorcism is a tough theory to sell.

332
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:56,815
The police don't think
the deaths are connected.

333
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,006
But you do.

334
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,210
You're gonna have
to give me some time here.

335
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:05,635
This is John Cooley.
He was also a friend of Matthew's.

336
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,348
I'm sorry. You saw him recently?

337
00:21:08,322 --> 00:21:11,059
Is there anyone he associated
with out of the usual?

338
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,896
Anyone overtly religious?

339
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,540
Not that I'm aware of.

340
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,836
I've been doin' my best
to retrace his steps,

341
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:19,287
but I still haven't come up
with anything.

342
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,510
Buy you a cup of coffee?

343
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,050
I will call you if I hear anything.

344
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,475
There are nicer places
to take a girl for coffee.

345
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,431
Did you ever see <i>The Exorcist</i>?

346
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:47,513
The real case started right here.

347
00:21:48,275 --> 00:21:50,133
The fire department actually...

348
00:21:50,621 --> 00:21:52,518
burned down the house themselves.

349
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:56,272
The authorities referred
to the boy as Robbie Doe.

350
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:59,943
- He's still in the D.C. area today.
- Why did you bring me here?

351
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:03,309
Whole lot of effort went
into destroying the house of a kid,

352
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,075
who probably had onset
schizophrenia or Tourette's syndrome.

353
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:10,453
- I'm not following you.
- You're sure he was murdered.

354
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:12,980
So what's the story?

355
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:20,037
If you don't wanna explain,

356
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,400
that's fine,

357
00:22:23,055 --> 00:22:25,243
but if you do, I'm all in.

358
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,126
Matthew knew
the bible inside and out,

359
00:22:31,344 --> 00:22:34,278
- and he started to question everything.
- Why?

360
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:45,785
We moved around a lot
when I was a kid,

361
00:22:46,137 --> 00:22:47,739
'cause of my mom's postings.

362
00:22:49,677 --> 00:22:51,405
It was hard to get accepted,

363
00:22:52,324 --> 00:22:53,664
and when you're 15,

364
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,506
that's all you want.

365
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,363
You'll do almost anything.

366
00:23:01,723 --> 00:23:02,714
You got pregnant.

367
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,053
- Was Matthew the father?
- No.

368
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,749
I didn't know what to do.

369
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,064
I couldn't tell my mom.

370
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,939
Matthew suggested
I talk with our priest.

371
00:23:20,263 --> 00:23:22,263
- And what did he say?
- He said

372
00:23:23,108 --> 00:23:25,945
that if I had an abortion,
I wasn't welcome in his congregation.

373
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,047
- So what'd you do?
- Matthew found a doctor.

374
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:30,450
He took me there.

375
00:23:31,232 --> 00:23:32,518
He stayed with me.

376
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:38,318
That Sunday
when we got back to Rome,

377
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:40,132
he held my hand

378
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,628
and walked me into the church.

379
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:47,053
Father Gamino actually
stopped his sermon,

380
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:52,096
but Matthew told me to hold my head up,
and we walked to the front pew.

381
00:23:52,649 --> 00:23:53,845
What did the priest do?

382
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,975
He and Matthew just
stared at each other.

383
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:58,655
It was like
a battle of wills, and...

384
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:02,375
and then suddenly father Gamino
went back to his sermon.

385
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,850
Matthew saved my life.

386
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,782
He made me feel

387
00:24:11,149 --> 00:24:12,865
like I was worthy of...

388
00:24:13,782 --> 00:24:14,832
Love and...

389
00:24:15,717 --> 00:24:16,767
friendship.

390
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:21,295
But that's when his anger
and questioning started.

391
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:24,045
He started doing drugs.

392
00:24:27,644 --> 00:24:30,580
When that melded
with his religious questioning,

393
00:24:30,705 --> 00:24:32,666
You could understand why his parents

394
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,764
were afraid he was possessed
by something evil.

395
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,802
It's my fault...

396
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:39,761
that Matthew's life unraveled.

397
00:24:40,614 --> 00:24:43,230
Garcia uncovered some information.

398
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,185
It's possible Matthew and the others

399
00:24:46,427 --> 00:24:47,735
killed someone in Spain.

400
00:24:49,813 --> 00:24:52,218
- I don't believe that.
- I'm just saying

401
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:56,392
if we keep pushing, you have to be
prepared for what we might discover.

402
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:00,247
I need Matthew to rest in peace.

403
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,415
I owe him that.

404
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:03,543
Then let's go give a profile.

405
00:25:04,978 --> 00:25:06,921
The police haven't invited us in.

406
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:10,787
The police aren't gonna do us
any good on this one, anyway.

407
00:25:11,784 --> 00:25:14,605
As I was saying to the
agents, this is a topic

408
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,165
on which we usually agree
to silently disagree.

409
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,215
And we all respect that.

410
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:24,344
We are not here to examine your
beliefs in demonology or exorcism,

411
00:25:24,469 --> 00:25:27,059
But we are operating
on the theory that...

412
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,402
the person responsible
for these deaths does believe.

413
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,798
We believe the inciting incident

414
00:25:31,923 --> 00:25:34,425
was the death
of father Raul Del Toro

415
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,533
in Galicia, Spain, 4 months ago.

416
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,659
How so?

417
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,195
There's an element who believes
that the death was actually a murder.

418
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:45,115
You're not suggesting that
this is some kind of retribution?

419
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,925
Even a priest can have
a psychotic break.

420
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:51,185
He may be under the delusion
that he is working for God.

421
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,645
The man we're looking for would be
obsessed with the event in Galicia.

422
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,455
He believes he's fighting evil

423
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,315
and may very well have followed
these men here to Washington.

424
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,055
We believe that one
of the exorcisms took place

425
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,345
over enough days for the victim
to die of dehydration.

426
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,523
If I may, an exorcism
is like a prize fight.

427
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,164
It's completely draining,
both physically and spiritually. Now,

428
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:15,656
if this man truly performed
three rituals

429
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,743
within the last few weeks,
he would need medical care.

430
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,798
Is there somewhere
he would go to convalesce?

431
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:25,166
Anything less than a working hospital
would be too dangerous.

432
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,745
- Garcia, it's Reid.
- <i>Speak, boy wonder.</i>

433
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,719
I need you to run
catholic hospital records.

434
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,704
<i>Look for any admissions
for exhaustion</i>

435
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:42,070
<i>immediately following
Patrick Cavanaugh's death.</i>

436
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,031
- You got it?
- You know I do.

437
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,348
Now run the same search
for the days immediately

438
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:50,109
- following the first 2 deaths.
- I sense a cross-check

439
00:26:50,234 --> 00:26:51,317
in my future.

440
00:26:51,698 --> 00:26:52,818
Do you have anything?

441
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:56,322
One hit: father Paul Silvano.

442
00:26:56,493 --> 00:26:58,915
<i>Currently at St. Agatha's hospital
on 214.</i>

443
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,034
We got him.

444
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,246
Are you father Paul Silvano?

445
00:27:08,915 --> 00:27:10,401
Were you present at the deaths

446
00:27:10,526 --> 00:27:13,735
of Thomas Valentine, Matthew Benton,
and Patrick Cavanaugh?

447
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,091
I've been expecting you.

448
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,530
He asked you a question.

449
00:27:20,710 --> 00:27:22,098
Yes, I was present.

450
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,398
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...

451
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,720
What did he say?

452
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,318
He wants you to look in the drawer.

453
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:36,362
We're both fighting the same evil.

454
00:27:40,109 --> 00:27:41,159
What is it?

455
00:27:42,045 --> 00:27:43,327
It's diplomatic status.

456
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,520
He has immunity?

457
00:27:58,469 --> 00:28:01,195
Explain to me why you were
the last person in the room

458
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,513
when three men died.

459
00:28:02,838 --> 00:28:03,988
I'm a priest.

460
00:28:04,526 --> 00:28:07,928
- I was there for them spiritually.
- They weren't on their deathbeds.

461
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:09,895
- Not physically.
- Did you kill them?

462
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,945
But you're not sorry
any of them are dead.

463
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:16,194
Physical death is always sad,

464
00:28:17,141 --> 00:28:19,227
but now their souls are in heaven.

465
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,074
For that, their families have peace.

466
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,078
Up until 4 months ago,
his record's spotless.

467
00:28:28,203 --> 00:28:30,954
No history of mental illness,
no censures.

468
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:34,295
He was even invited to say mass
at the Washington national cathedral.

469
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:36,085
What happened 4 months ago?

470
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:38,883
No details. Just says he took
a sabbatical for personal reasons.

471
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:42,656
4 months ago is just
after the death in Spain.

472
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,152
It looks like he lobbied the Vatican

473
00:28:45,277 --> 00:28:47,795
for a diplomatic posting,
but they refused.

474
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,924
After that, he took the world hunger
mission from the Italian government.

475
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,167
Which brought him here
with immunity.

476
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:56,734
- Where's Hotch?
- On the phone with the department.

477
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,471
Gather the others.
I'll be there in a second.

478
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:02,983
Did you know...

479
00:29:04,626 --> 00:29:06,660
The priest who died in Galicia?

480
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,095
Father Del Toro and I
were at seminary together.

481
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:12,249
Did you know that Matthew Benton
and the other men

482
00:29:12,444 --> 00:29:14,168
were in Galicia the week he died?

483
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:19,799
- Do you believe they committed murder?
- I was contacted by a family member.

484
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,525
He was frightened.

485
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:25,135
He told me his real son never
returned home from that trip.

486
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,805
And you suggested
that he was possessed.

487
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,785
I said that I could help
rid his child of evil.

488
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:33,065
What did you tell
the other family members

489
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,714
after you watched their sons die,
that it was god's will?

490
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,984
I've never laid a hand on
anyone with malice in my life.

491
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,945
Then explain these deaths to me.

492
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,366
You know the power of evil.

493
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,411
You've been fighting it a long time.

494
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,440
Be strong.

495
00:29:58,019 --> 00:29:59,444
The storm's almost over.

496
00:30:05,726 --> 00:30:06,726
Yes, sir.

497
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,174
I completely understand.

498
00:30:09,583 --> 00:30:12,582
As far as I know,
he's here voluntarily.

499
00:30:14,993 --> 00:30:15,874
Right.

500
00:30:18,987 --> 00:30:21,243
I understand it's a delicate situation.

501
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,806
What'd he say?

502
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:26,962
He claims he was
invited by the families.

503
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,865
And now he has them believing
their loved ones are in a better place.

504
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,566
And they're all devout.
The people they loved were troubled.

505
00:30:32,691 --> 00:30:35,556
It's either believe they're in
a better place or live with the guilt.

506
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:37,501
It doesn't matter.
We can't arrest him.

507
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,405
- Can we deport him?
- Probably not.

508
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:41,130
It's crazy. Diplomatic immunity

509
00:30:41,299 --> 00:30:43,525
wasn't intended to shield people
from murder charges.

510
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:46,595
So Hotch bypasses the state department,
goes straight to the Italian consulate.

511
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,225
And loses his career.

512
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:51,115
The state department won't
risk the potential embarrassment.

513
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,934
- They'll shut us all down.
- There's some real politic for you.

514
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:56,912
- So what do we do now?
- Did you check his papers with ice?

515
00:30:57,037 --> 00:30:59,809
Yeah. His diplomatic status
runs till the end of the month.

516
00:31:00,996 --> 00:31:02,568
- What?
- He told Emily,

517
00:31:02,792 --> 00:31:04,069
"The storm's almost over".

518
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,899
- So...
- So forget priest. Think unsub.

519
00:31:08,488 --> 00:31:11,059
He's a believer. He
deals in certainties.

520
00:31:11,184 --> 00:31:13,704
In his mind, he has a job to do.

521
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,706
Which doesn't end until
the end of the month.

522
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:18,407
"The storm's almost over".

523
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:21,545
There's another victim on his list.

524
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:23,506
What caused their deaths?

525
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,836
- Medically?
- Yes. Please.

526
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,677
- I can't say.
- Were they under stress?

527
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,680
We all were.

528
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,845
- Did you sprinkle holy water on them?
- That's part of the exorcism ritual.

529
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,521
What was in the holy water?
Sarin? VX?

530
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:41,649
The smallest amount would
trigger respiratory failure.

531
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,692
- I'm not familiar with them.
- No? Really?

532
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,530
Because that's what a lot of people
think killed father Del Toro in Spain.

533
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,500
Father, you're free to go.

534
00:31:53,263 --> 00:31:55,538
We're sorry if detaining you
has caused you any hardship.

535
00:31:58,826 --> 00:32:00,167
I hope you find peace.

536
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,259
My office.

537
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:12,333
Are you actually accusing
the Italian government

538
00:32:12,458 --> 00:32:14,445
of authorizing
this man's assassination list?

539
00:32:14,570 --> 00:32:16,809
He admits he was present at every death.

540
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,670
The case is over.

541
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:23,410
- You said you'd give me leeway.
- And I did.

542
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,144
I understand your frustration.

543
00:32:25,269 --> 00:32:27,502
There are some things
that we cannot control.

544
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,755
- Take some time off.
- What?

545
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,450
I don't wanna see you in the
office for the next few days.

546
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:46,060
You up for another drive?

547
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:06,019
- What are you doing here?
- Matthew died during an exorcism

548
00:33:06,144 --> 00:33:07,535
by father Paul Silvano.

549
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,935
He's performed 3
in the last few weeks.

550
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,865
Each subject has died.
We believe he's planning another one.

551
00:33:13,275 --> 00:33:16,076
- That's none of our business.
- Matthew's gone. You've accepted that.

552
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,415
At least let us warn the last family

553
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:20,763
so they know what kind of choice
they're facing.

554
00:33:22,916 --> 00:33:24,416
This isn't about me.

555
00:33:25,045 --> 00:33:27,868
This is about other families
and the people they love.

556
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,557
Father Paul didn't kill Matthew.

557
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,976
Why are you so willing to accept that?

558
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:44,525
I'm just trying to find the truth
about how your son died.

559
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:46,050
Then listen to me.

560
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,895
Father Paul never
laid a hand on Matthew.

561
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,394
How do you know that?

562
00:33:52,323 --> 00:33:53,155
Dad!

563
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,700
And all your dark companions!

564
00:33:57,294 --> 00:33:59,745
Don't look him in the eye!
Don't engage him!

565
00:34:00,258 --> 00:34:02,026
- Dad, please.
- I cast you out...

566
00:34:02,151 --> 00:34:03,332
Dad, please!

567
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:06,418
Don't look him in the eyes!

568
00:34:07,771 --> 00:34:08,871
I was there.

569
00:34:12,013 --> 00:34:15,052
You stood there and watched Matthew die?

570
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,954
He wasn't the person you knew.

571
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:21,350
Because father Paul said that?

572
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:26,955
Something horrible happened
on that trip to Spain.

573
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,468
You believe that because
father Paul said it.

574
00:34:29,593 --> 00:34:33,195
- You can't think for yourself?
- Young lady, don't speak like that.

575
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,824
How could you allow him to
perform a ritual over Matthew?

576
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,785
- I loved my son.
- Then you knew how Matthew was.

577
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:43,885
- You knew how paranoid he could be.
- I was trying to save his life.

578
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,515
That priest must have done something.

579
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,377
His heart wouldn't have given out.

580
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,420
That thing killed Matthew!

581
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,381
It was inside him for years.

582
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,883
- I know you know that's true.
- No.

583
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:58,637
Matthew was a sweet boy.
He was just troubled.

584
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,640
He was never troubled until he met you.

585
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,102
Look, we need to know
about the demon

586
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:10,899
that possessed your son.

587
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:15,355
Father Paul explained
that Matthew was a conduit.

588
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,072
If you opened yourself, you were

589
00:35:17,342 --> 00:35:19,408
putting yourself in danger
of being taken over.

590
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:22,327
Who else was Matthew with
while he was in Spain?

591
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,435
- I don't know.
- Who did he see once he was back?

592
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,875
- None.
- Please think.

593
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,170
If father Paul believes
Matthew was a conduit,

594
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,964
anyone he spent time with
could be a target.

595
00:35:34,934 --> 00:35:37,259
He was not to see anyone
until he was better.

596
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:38,594
No, that's not true.

597
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:41,495
I know for a fact he saw
our friend John Cooley.

598
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,825
His parents worked with my mother
at the embassy in Rome.

599
00:35:43,950 --> 00:35:46,059
You called him to tell
him Matthew had died.

600
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,648
I haven't spoken with John
Cooley in over 20 years,

601
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,026
not since you were kids in Italy.

602
00:36:07,685 --> 00:36:10,494
- They're going to stop you.
- They have no authority.

603
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,865
My orders come from God.

604
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,685
I'm not part of your congregation.
You have no right to be here.

605
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:18,342
You don't frighten me... Belial.

606
00:36:25,427 --> 00:36:26,930
We'll see about that.

607
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,104
Murderer!

608
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,444
- We need to talk.
- What's wrong?

609
00:36:54,569 --> 00:36:57,108
- He's performing another exorcism.
- How do you know?

610
00:36:57,233 --> 00:36:59,466
Prentiss and I went to see
Matthew Benton's parents.

611
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,905
- I gave her a direct order.
- This one is all on me.

612
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:04,545
That's fine, Dave, by the state
department's all over my ass.

613
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,890
- Where's Prentiss now?
- She and Morgan went to stop it.

614
00:37:07,149 --> 00:37:09,525
- I can't protect them.
- I don't accept that.

615
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:13,455
Governments don't really appreciate
being accused of accessory to murder.

616
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,369
- Why not go straight to the Vatican?
- What are we supposed to say to them?

617
00:37:16,494 --> 00:37:18,527
Say, "Talk to the Italian government.

618
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,572
"Help us stop this man from
perverting your beliefs."

619
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,161
This comes down on all of us.

620
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,163
I'm fine with that? You?

621
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:38,112
You're a murderer! You're a murderer!

622
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,358
I abjure you!

623
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:55,758
- I will cast you out like the...
- You're a murderer!Murderer!

624
00:37:55,883 --> 00:37:57,895
I abjure you
in the name of the spotless...

625
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,610
- Step away from him!
- FBI!

626
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:02,025
- Tremble and flee...
- Step away from him!

627
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,239
- As we call on the name of the lord.
- Step away.

628
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,336
- You have no right!
- This is my friend's house.

629
00:38:06,461 --> 00:38:08,608
- This is not your friend!
- Murderer!

630
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,539
- Step away.
- Stop!

631
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,500
- What is in that bottle?
- Stop!

632
00:38:15,566 --> 00:38:16,395
Out!

633
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,755
Don't protect him. They didn't
protect you when you were a little boy.

634
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:23,495
Give praise to the lord jesus christ.

635
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:26,585
John. I wanna untie you,
but I need you to calm down.

636
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,725
Look at me. It's Emily. John.

637
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,059
All right, I'm gonna untie you.
Just stay calm, OK?

638
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:45,325
Emily, come on. I'm fine.

639
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,235
No. Look at you.
Stress can tear your body apart.

640
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,119
That's what happened to Matthew.

641
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,693
Emily, I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.

642
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,876
In italy.

643
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,131
OK, just let them do their job.

644
00:39:06,188 --> 00:39:07,188
Good-bye.

645
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,260
I'll check on you later.

646
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:17,521
If you want my gun and
badge, I understand.

647
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:21,858
There's a plane ticket
in your name to Rome.

648
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:24,250
Agent Morgan and I will
drive you to the airport.

649
00:39:24,375 --> 00:39:26,238
Any of your belongings
can be shipped to you.

650
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:29,908
- You have no right to deport me.
- The vatican intervened.

651
00:39:30,218 --> 00:39:33,245
The Italian government has
rescinded your diplomatic status.

652
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,137
They'll do with you as they see fit
when you're back in their jurisdiction.

653
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:41,128
You've all just made the world
a much more dangerous place.

654
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,405
I saw that guy up there.

655
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,415
He was certain he was fighting
against evil.

656
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:57,477
- We all have to be certain.
- Don't tell me you believe in evil.

657
00:39:57,690 --> 00:40:00,095
Don't tell me you do
this job and you don't.

658
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,815
I believe there are evil acts,

659
00:40:02,588 --> 00:40:04,188
but those are choices,

660
00:40:04,766 --> 00:40:05,861
brain chemistry.

661
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,033
What do you think, Hotch?

662
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:12,676
I think deep down, we're all
capable of unspeakable things.

663
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,740
Where it starts or what you call it,

664
00:40:16,285 --> 00:40:17,435
I don't know.

665
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,000
Let's get him out of here.

666
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:24,790
Always.

667
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,589
What are you thinking?

668
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:36,370
It's like <i>The end of the dead</i>...

669
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:41,800
When Gretta remembers the boy
she loved when she was younger

670
00:40:43,265 --> 00:40:44,515
and she says...

671
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,305
I think he died for me.

672
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,195
You know, James Joyce also said,

673
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:57,234
"There is no heresy or philosophy so
abhorrent to the church

674
00:40:58,258 --> 00:40:59,498
"as a human being."

675
00:41:03,190 --> 00:41:04,740
Where can I drop you?

676
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,010
I'm gonna walk for a while.

677
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,240
Almost seems unreal, doesn't it?
