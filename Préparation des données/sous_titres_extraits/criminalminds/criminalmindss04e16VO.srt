1
00:00:16,256 --> 00:00:17,256
Giddy-up.

2
00:00:17,381 --> 00:00:19,040
Well, it's about time.

3
00:00:19,626 --> 00:00:21,855
I promise I will make it up to you.

4
00:00:22,145 --> 00:00:25,520
Now, tell me what you want.

5
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:28,028
I want...

6
00:00:32,297 --> 00:00:33,497
I can do that.

7
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:57,124
What are you doing?

8
00:01:12,646 --> 00:01:14,048
Hey, lover.

9
00:01:15,974 --> 00:01:16,974
Tonight?

10
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:18,870
Yeah. I'm wide open.

11
00:01:20,499 --> 00:01:21,466
2 a.m.?

12
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:24,321
You like to make me wait, don't you?

13
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,002
You want the usual?

14
00:01:34,597 --> 00:01:36,547
So where do you want to meet?

15
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:37,752
The Cutler.

16
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,410
I think I can do that.

17
00:01:57,586 --> 00:01:59,767
<i>Look, mom, look what I can do.</i>

18
00:02:00,141 --> 00:02:01,329
<i>I can do it myself.</i>

19
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:03,875
<i>Hi, dad.</i>

20
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:11,048
Agent, this is Patrick jackson,
attorney general down in Texas.

21
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:12,674
What can I do for you?

22
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:15,006
I got a case here in Dallas and...

23
00:02:15,738 --> 00:02:18,597
Well, your director thought
you might be the person for a consult.

24
00:02:18,766 --> 00:02:21,505
Could you forward the details
to Jennifer Jareau, our liaison?

25
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:24,223
Not your team,
agent Hotchner. Just you.

26
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:27,219
<i>- What's the reason for that, sir?
- You'll be briefed on the ground.</i>

27
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:30,609
Could you send details
about the case or the unsub?

28
00:02:31,297 --> 00:02:33,524
It's not the unsub
you need to worry about.

29
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:34,999
It's the lawyers.

30
00:02:35,866 --> 00:02:37,616
How soon can you be here?

31
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,375
Does the name Hoyt Ashford
ring a bell?

32
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,194
- Investment banker?
- Close. Hedge fund manager.

33
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,498
You might have seen him
on TV all red in the face,

34
00:02:48,623 --> 00:02:50,750
saying the real estate
crisis wasn't a big thing.

35
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,492
I did see his public apology
on the news channels when it was.

36
00:02:53,617 --> 00:02:54,829
That was unfortunate,

37
00:02:54,954 --> 00:02:57,843
'cause now his lawyers
want to classify this as suicide.

38
00:03:00,418 --> 00:03:03,447
We kept the scene preserved.
Your consult might buy us some time.

39
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:06,752
Well, most men don't take viagra
before they kill themselves.

40
00:03:07,717 --> 00:03:10,232
- Does he have a wife?
- At home, with the kids.

41
00:03:10,401 --> 00:03:11,775
Mistress or prostitute?

42
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:15,891
What I'm about to tell you
is confidential information.

43
00:03:16,016 --> 00:03:18,183
It's not to be included
in any reports.

44
00:03:19,644 --> 00:03:21,702
Every wednesday,
Ashford withdrew $10,000

45
00:03:22,007 --> 00:03:23,607
out of a fund in cash.

46
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,999
- Today was no different.
- So, high-end prostitute.

47
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,835
We interviewed the valet,
the concierge. Nobody saw her.

48
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:32,936
Well, that's not surprising.
These women know how to be discreet.

49
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:36,174
You'd think with profit margins,
they'd show a little restraint.

50
00:03:36,546 --> 00:03:38,009
So this isn't the first?

51
00:03:38,262 --> 00:03:39,594
We think it's the second.

52
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:45,532
I am going to call my team.

53
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:46,532
Understood.

54
00:03:46,657 --> 00:03:48,812
But there is a reason
why I wanted you here first.

55
00:03:49,565 --> 00:03:53,108
I got 3 judges and one state senator
asking if I'm sure I have a case.

56
00:03:53,386 --> 00:03:55,704
You poke around, this type of woman,
this type of lifestyle,

57
00:03:55,829 --> 00:03:57,362
people get edgy, call in favors.

58
00:03:57,531 --> 00:03:59,864
I'm sorry, but the politics
of this are your problem.

59
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:02,584
Yes, they are. And of course,
we all want her stopped.

60
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,735
You don't want
any big fish caught in the net.

61
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,118
That's how it's got to be,

62
00:04:06,243 --> 00:04:09,056
or I have to rescind the request
for bureau involvement.

63
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,981
Local murders, local case.

64
00:04:11,927 --> 00:04:15,265
All right. I need a place for my team
to set up and all your case files.

65
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,604
- I'll send it over.
- I'll be in touch in the morning.

66
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:20,686
Thank you, agent Hotchner.

67
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:23,504
- What floor?
- 16. Thank you.

68
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,648
Long night?

69
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:36,479
Kind of. Yeah.

70
00:04:37,757 --> 00:04:38,820
Yeah. Me, too.

71
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:41,614
These Tokyo markets are killing me.

72
00:04:53,675 --> 00:04:55,423
- Excuse me.
- Good night.

73
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,110
Darling.

74
00:06:03,761 --> 00:06:05,668
<i>"The prostitute is not,
as feminists claim,</i>

75
00:06:05,793 --> 00:06:08,540
<i>"the victim of men,
but rather their conqueror.</i>

76
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:11,693
<i>"An outlaw, who controls
the sexual channels</i>

77
00:06:11,818 --> 00:06:13,720
<i>between nature and culture."</i>

78
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:15,341
<i>Camille Paglia.</i>

79
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:17,648
Female serial killers
are a fascinating field.

80
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:19,587
We don't have much
information on them,

81
00:06:19,756 --> 00:06:22,716
but what we do know involves throwing
the rules completely out the window.

82
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,843
<i>Signature, for instance.
They don't torture or take trophies.</i>

83
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:28,221
There's no sexual gratification
when they kill.

84
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,057
Exactly. Murder is the goal.
They don't have to do anything extra.

85
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:32,937
Women are more efficient at killing.

86
00:06:33,062 --> 00:06:35,411
Historically, they have had
body counts in the hundreds.

87
00:06:35,536 --> 00:06:37,243
So assuming that the job
is the stressor,

88
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:39,882
what are some of the reasons
prostitutes kill their customers?

89
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:42,173
Money, drugs,
post-traumatic stress disorder.

90
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:44,610
At some point, every call girl,
no matter how well paid,

91
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,726
gets coerced into an activity
she didn't consent to.

92
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:50,130
Aileen Wuornos
used to purposefully stage

93
00:06:50,255 --> 00:06:53,656
paid sexual encounters as an excuse to
murder men she thought would rape her.

94
00:06:53,781 --> 00:06:55,985
But Wuornos was
psychotic and disorganized.

95
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:59,023
I think this girl's poisoning
them before she has sex with them.

96
00:06:59,148 --> 00:07:01,498
<i>She's using tetra-methylene-
disulfotetramine.</i>

97
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:05,011
It's a popular rat poison in China,
easily soluble in alcohol.

98
00:07:05,136 --> 00:07:07,427
Poison is the perfect m.o.
Quiet, quick,

99
00:07:07,596 --> 00:07:10,513
and the victims never see it coming
because they think they're lucky.

100
00:07:10,682 --> 00:07:13,623
- <i>Does that mean something to you?</i>
- At $10,000 a night,

101
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:16,144
these men are paying
for discretion as well as sex.

102
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:18,607
She has a history with them.
They see her repeatedly.

103
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:20,815
<i>She didn't decide
to kill them in the moment.</i>

104
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:23,983
She walks in with the intent to kill
and she's doing it before sleeping.

105
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:26,478
So she's not just organized,
she's also methodical.

106
00:07:26,603 --> 00:07:28,724
She decides which one of
her clients are worth killing

107
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:30,325
and which aren't and she plans.

108
00:07:30,494 --> 00:07:32,911
Maybe the victims
all share the same fetish.

109
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,791
Both victims were in their 50s,
highly visible. Careful out their image.

110
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,333
If they were kinky,

111
00:07:38,497 --> 00:07:41,011
- they'd go to lengths to hide it.
- We're facing a corporate culture

112
00:07:41,136 --> 00:07:42,921
that'll do everything to keep us out.

113
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,576
Actually, I had some luck there.

114
00:07:44,701 --> 00:07:46,945
Hoyt Ashford's wife isn't
too happy with how he died.

115
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,379
<i>She's agreed to talk to us?</i>

116
00:07:48,504 --> 00:07:51,179
Yeah, but because every silver
lining has a dark cloud,

117
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:53,806
The hedge fund released a statement.

118
00:07:54,331 --> 00:07:58,275
"Ashford died peacefully in his home,
according to lawyer David Madison."

119
00:07:58,614 --> 00:08:01,898
- They're trying to close ranks.
- Does that sound familiar to anyone?

120
00:08:02,122 --> 00:08:03,169
<i>What do you mean?</i>

121
00:08:03,294 --> 00:08:05,443
The press release
from the first victim.

122
00:08:06,203 --> 00:08:09,280
"According to company lawyer,
Stanton died peacefully

123
00:08:09,449 --> 00:08:10,513
<i>"in his home."</i>

124
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,952
Start with the wife.
See if you can get her to open up.

125
00:08:14,121 --> 00:08:17,205
JJ, call the lawyers and tell them
I want to meet with both of them.

126
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:20,821
- To play them off each other?
- One of them wrote both press releases.

127
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:22,460
Let's see which one calls us.

128
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:36,084
Babe.

129
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:38,954
What time is it?

130
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:42,129
If you leave now,
you can get your kids to school.

131
00:08:51,575 --> 00:08:52,824
<i>Thank you, agent Hotchner.</i>

132
00:09:01,983 --> 00:09:03,448
<i>The Phoenix police announced</i>

133
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:06,631
<i>the suspect responsible
for the deaths of 5 phoenix officers</i>

134
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,189
<i>had been caught.
That is not the case.</i>

135
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:11,264
<i>The killer is still at large.</i>

136
00:09:15,139 --> 00:09:17,515
Mrs. Ashford, we're very sorry
about our husband.

137
00:09:18,055 --> 00:09:20,482
I've been getting nothing
but condolences all day.

138
00:09:20,607 --> 00:09:22,717
I feel like a hypocrite
for accepting them,

139
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,352
knowing how he died.

140
00:09:24,477 --> 00:09:27,642
We think your husband might have been
targeted because of something...

141
00:09:27,767 --> 00:09:29,822
sexual he did with this call girl.

142
00:09:31,716 --> 00:09:34,523
We know this is hard, but is there
anything you can tell us

143
00:09:34,648 --> 00:09:36,147
about what he liked?

144
00:09:36,272 --> 00:09:38,758
In bed?
I can sum it up in one word.

145
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:41,013
Younger.

146
00:09:41,138 --> 00:09:42,415
How much younger?

147
00:09:42,796 --> 00:09:44,616
24, 25. It's...

148
00:09:45,381 --> 00:09:47,858
- That was when I met him.
- So, your age difference

149
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:50,048
- was part of the attraction?
- Are you kidding?

150
00:09:50,247 --> 00:09:51,632
It was the whole relationship.

151
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:53,868
Mrs. Ashford, no offense, but...

152
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:56,924
your husband spent a lot of money
on this woman.

153
00:09:57,739 --> 00:09:59,234
Was there anything else at all

154
00:09:59,359 --> 00:10:02,101
that he liked from a younger
woman besides the ego boost?

155
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:06,346
There's a certain kind of man, agent

156
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:09,466
for whom the only kind
of sex that matters

157
00:10:09,591 --> 00:10:11,211
is the ego boost.

158
00:10:11,489 --> 00:10:13,029
But in a marriage like ours,

159
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:16,302
after few years, it doesn't come
voluntarily anymore.

160
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:18,482
You have to work at it.

161
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,376
Or in my husband's case...

162
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:23,692
Pay for it.

163
00:10:29,447 --> 00:10:32,215
JJ, both lawyers said
that they would be here at noon.

164
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:35,593
They called back and said they would
meet you at the Manchester center.

165
00:10:35,762 --> 00:10:37,644
It's almost 12:30
neither of them are here.

166
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:40,146
Can you text me the numbers?
I need to call.

167
00:10:40,271 --> 00:10:42,309
- Never mind. She's here.
- She?

168
00:10:43,165 --> 00:10:45,020
Ellen daniels.
Barswell consulting.

169
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:49,155
Ms. Daniels, we called two lawyers
and neither of them was you.

170
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,621
They called me to consult
on the press releases.

171
00:10:51,746 --> 00:10:55,332
My firm specializes in strategic risk
management for firms around the city.

172
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,159
- You're a problem solver.
- And we have a mutual one, don't we?

173
00:10:59,494 --> 00:11:01,476
- Do you know who this girl is?
- no.

174
00:11:01,635 --> 00:11:03,246
One of your clients might.

175
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:07,064
- They're not gonna open up about it.
- They're putting themselves at risk.

176
00:11:07,189 --> 00:11:09,585
Yes, I understand that,
but you see, my hands are tied.

177
00:11:09,754 --> 00:11:12,421
None of them are going to admit that
they have a professional girlfriend.

178
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:14,173
I can subpoena their records.

179
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:17,343
Then I would have to file about a year's
worth of injunctions to stall you.

180
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:20,471
- Now, who needs that kind of hassle?
- Ms. Daniels, this is not a game.

181
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:23,698
I need number, if not of this particular
girl, then someone like her,

182
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,166
someone we can talk to.

183
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:28,008
No escort will agree
to sit down with the FBI.

184
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:30,774
But I have something better for you,

185
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,985
assuming you might be willing
to overlook certain legal niceties.

186
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:38,490
Do you want to buy a house?

187
00:11:43,126 --> 00:11:44,226
Yes, you do.

188
00:11:54,097 --> 00:11:56,972
I don't get it. I thought Hotch said
we were going to meet a madam here.

189
00:11:57,097 --> 00:11:59,979
Actually, there's a lot of overlap
between real estate and sex work.

190
00:12:00,104 --> 00:12:02,513
Property is a safe
and inspection-free investment

191
00:12:02,682 --> 00:12:03,844
for large sums of cash.

192
00:12:03,969 --> 00:12:06,405
Your brownstone used to be
owned by a gigolo.

193
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,936
Hello, you two!

194
00:12:08,271 --> 00:12:10,551
- Are you the...
- Isn't this neighborhood just fabulous?

195
00:12:10,676 --> 00:12:12,691
And you're gonna love this house.

196
00:12:14,592 --> 00:12:16,386
You two need lessons in faking it.

197
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,939
I teach a class.

198
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:19,649
I'm... I'm sorry.

199
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,722
I just... I want to be clear.

200
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,593
You are a madam, right?

201
00:12:23,754 --> 00:12:25,412
You arrange dates for escorts?

202
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:27,179
All I arrange are meetings.

203
00:12:27,304 --> 00:12:30,047
What happens between two consenting
adults when that meeting is over

204
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:31,895
is something i'm not liable for.

205
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,963
Now...

206
00:12:33,664 --> 00:12:34,921
Who wants a scone?

207
00:12:39,344 --> 00:12:41,590
Oh, yes.
We all know about this woman.

208
00:12:41,979 --> 00:12:43,472
She's terrible for business.

209
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,717
I guess there's only
so many men that can

210
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:47,777
afford the service you provide.

211
00:12:47,902 --> 00:12:49,463
Well, that's certainly true.

212
00:12:49,588 --> 00:12:52,104
But the way she's behaving,
she's only hurting herself.

213
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,165
- And why is that?
- An escort's client list

214
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:56,223
is the most important
investment she has.

215
00:12:56,348 --> 00:13:00,132
It's her daily income and her retirement
package when she sells the list.

216
00:13:00,257 --> 00:13:02,878
So she isn't working
with a service, is she?

217
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:05,827
No madam would allow
an escort to kill off the <i>clientèle</i>.

218
00:13:06,511 --> 00:13:08,455
What about the type of work

219
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,190
your employees do?

220
00:13:10,636 --> 00:13:12,426
We're sort of operating
under the assumption

221
00:13:12,551 --> 00:13:14,627
that this escort is killing men

222
00:13:14,963 --> 00:13:17,208
who... make her perform a...

223
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:20,726
Specific sexual act.

224
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:23,843
- What did you have in mind, sweetie?
- I... I don't even... I don't know.

225
00:13:23,968 --> 00:13:24,968
If I may.

226
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:28,474
I think you're looking at this
all wrong. Start with this question...

227
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:30,726
Why would a man pay
a woman 5 figures?

228
00:13:31,099 --> 00:13:32,893
<i>It's not for sex, is it?</i>

229
00:13:33,018 --> 00:13:35,522
<i>Of course you've got to be
good in bed to be successful.</i>

230
00:13:35,647 --> 00:13:38,317
<i>- But that's the easy part.
- What's the difficult part?</i>

231
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:42,197
<i>What men want more than
the no strings attached sex</i>

232
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,711
<i>is a therapist.</i>

233
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:47,008
<i>Someone who will absorb the
worst parts of their personalities.</i>

234
00:13:47,383 --> 00:13:49,678
<i>Their fears
and their insecurities.</i>

235
00:13:49,803 --> 00:13:52,653
<i>Everything they can't
take home to their wife.</i>

236
00:13:53,161 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>That's what I groom my girls to do...</i>

237
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:57,086
<i>How to talk to these men.
How to listen.</i>

238
00:13:57,755 --> 00:14:00,101
<i>Don't get me wrong.
Deviancy comes with the territory.</i>

239
00:14:00,226 --> 00:14:02,591
<i>I can't tell you how many men
need to be submissive</i>

240
00:14:02,846 --> 00:14:05,529
<i>as an outlet from their
extremely stressful jobs.</i>

241
00:14:05,654 --> 00:14:09,396
I can tell you that if the sex was
the reason she was killing these men,

242
00:14:09,521 --> 00:14:12,512
she would have broken
long before she charged $10,000.

243
00:14:12,637 --> 00:14:14,789
So it isn't how these men
act in bed,

244
00:14:14,914 --> 00:14:16,272
it's how they act out of it.

245
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:07,617
Jesse, what's your 20?

246
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:10,664
I'm just starting my sweep.

247
00:15:24,446 --> 00:15:27,095
Victim was Joseph Fielding.
He was the cfo here.

248
00:15:27,603 --> 00:15:29,479
- Poisoned?
- And staged.

249
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:32,348
She killed him in his office and
rolled him out here to be found.

250
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,844
- The lipstick's new.
- Done postmortem.

251
00:15:34,969 --> 00:15:37,921
Reid said female serial killers
don't leave a signature.

252
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:39,973
I think she did that just for us.

253
00:15:40,098 --> 00:15:42,646
She's exposed him at his most
vulnerable. Now she wants to be noticed.

254
00:15:42,771 --> 00:15:44,121
I'm allowed back.

255
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,389
Which one of you is Aaron Hotchner?

256
00:15:47,824 --> 00:15:48,697
I'm Hotchner.

257
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,201
Larry Bartlett. I represent Mr.
Fielding in webster industries.

258
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:54,745
This is a closed
crime scene, Mr. Bartlett.

259
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:56,321
Yes. I spoke to Ellen Daniels.

260
00:15:56,446 --> 00:15:58,896
She said you're
a very reasonable man.

261
00:15:59,308 --> 00:16:01,805
- Escort him out, please.
- No, wait. Please.

262
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:04,780
The press is outside
and they can smell blood.

263
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,134
- Any way we can handle this discreetly?
- We're not about to lie for you.

264
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,953
You don't have to lie.
Just don't comment.

265
00:16:12,105 --> 00:16:13,105
Excuse us.

266
00:16:17,848 --> 00:16:19,461
Is there any reason
to go public yet?

267
00:16:19,586 --> 00:16:21,819
Validating her
is exactly what she wants.

268
00:16:21,944 --> 00:16:24,493
If we hold back,
she's more likely to make a mistake.

269
00:16:24,618 --> 00:16:26,444
He doesn't need to know that.

270
00:16:28,304 --> 00:16:30,445
We need everything
you have on Fielding.

271
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:33,470
Bank accounts, tax records,
emails, everything.

272
00:16:38,493 --> 00:16:39,493
Everything?

273
00:16:41,466 --> 00:16:44,361
18 cars, 6 houses, and 3 boats.

274
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:46,106
Can you even boat in Dallas?

275
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:48,166
When you're talking about
that much money,

276
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:51,093
10 grand for a call girl
is like deciding where to go for dinner.

277
00:16:51,288 --> 00:16:53,234
<i>- Are you there, Garcia?
- Affirmative.</i>

278
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:56,766
I have half a million over here
for something called the bat cave.

279
00:16:57,401 --> 00:17:00,201
And here's a picture of him
as fetish batman.

280
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:01,896
That is wrong.

281
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,827
Anything he didn't like
to spend money on?

282
00:17:03,952 --> 00:17:05,065
Yeah, his ex-wives.

283
00:17:05,328 --> 00:17:07,838
Fielding was married 4 time
he didn't have prenups the first two,

284
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,070
but he did everything
he could to cut off his ex-wives.

285
00:17:10,338 --> 00:17:12,948
- Are there children involved?
- Yes, with 3 of the wives.

286
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,242
Ashford was married
a few times, too, wasn't he?

287
00:17:15,442 --> 00:17:17,867
You know, considering
that when Kevin takes me to dinner

288
00:17:17,992 --> 00:17:21,416
and a movie, he defaults on his student
loans, this amount of money is sick.

289
00:17:21,812 --> 00:17:24,964
- What did you find?
- All 3 of our dearly departed rich guys

290
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,042
were embroiled
in bitter court battles

291
00:17:27,167 --> 00:17:29,424
over how much to pay in
alimony and child support,

292
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:31,675
and even when the court
ruled in the wife's favor,

293
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:34,303
which was almost always,
these 3 charmers just, you know,

294
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:36,007
<i>decided not to pay.</i>

295
00:17:36,132 --> 00:17:38,098
Can you generate a list of high-profile

296
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,211
Dallas CEOs who are holding
out on their ex-wives?

297
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:44,022
One loaded losers list, Dallas edition,
comin' at ya. Penelope out.

298
00:17:44,514 --> 00:17:46,356
So why would a prominent businessman

299
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:49,005
who could easily pay
child support refuse to?

300
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:51,002
For this type of
overachieving personality,

301
00:17:51,127 --> 00:17:53,614
paying money after the marriage
ends probably offends him.

302
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:55,929
They're spending tens
of thousands on an escort,

303
00:17:56,054 --> 00:17:57,993
but they won't drop a dime
on their family?

304
00:17:58,162 --> 00:18:00,037
- That's cold.
- Narcissistic, self-absorbed,

305
00:18:00,206 --> 00:18:02,671
a pathological avoidance
of paternal responsibilities.

306
00:18:02,796 --> 00:18:05,864
Most prostitutes come from broken
homes, she's listening to pillow talk.

307
00:18:05,989 --> 00:18:07,545
Could serve as some sort of trigger.

308
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,781
How their ex-wives are
cheating them out of money,

309
00:18:09,906 --> 00:18:11,426
how their kids are nagging them.

310
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:14,009
Everything that they take for granted
and that she never had.

311
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,274
Should I assemble
the police for a profile?

312
00:18:16,399 --> 00:18:18,407
I just don't think it's gonna help.

313
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:20,699
She lives in a completely
different world than they do.

314
00:18:20,824 --> 00:18:22,640
Same with the news-watching public.

315
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,145
And the CEOs who sleep
with her won't admit to it.

316
00:18:25,314 --> 00:18:28,954
Like I couldn't even get past
the team of lawyers protecting them.

317
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,440
What if we give the profile
to the corporate lawyers?

318
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:33,305
They've cleaned up after her,

319
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,624
even if they don't realize
that they've seen this woman.

320
00:18:35,749 --> 00:18:38,305
Because every time we've approached
them, they've circled the wagons.

321
00:18:38,430 --> 00:18:40,077
Why this is going
to be any different?

322
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,496
Because she's putting
them at risk, too.

323
00:18:42,716 --> 00:18:46,000
We're looking for a white woman
between the ages of 25 and 30.

324
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:49,410
She's paid between
10 and $15,000 per session,

325
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:52,282
and she's very well versed
in the world of money and privilege.

326
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:54,402
Even she's a call girl,
she doesn't look like one.

327
00:18:54,527 --> 00:18:56,928
She could pass as
a businesswoman or a co-worker.

328
00:18:57,338 --> 00:18:59,892
You've probably written up
her personal expenses as losses.

329
00:19:00,017 --> 00:19:01,306
Shoes, jewelry, clothing.

330
00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:05,134
Your bosses pay her in cash, but they
may also be paying her in other ways...

331
00:19:05,259 --> 00:19:07,320
Taking care of her, a new car,

332
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:09,321
paying for her medical bills, even.

333
00:19:09,446 --> 00:19:11,937
She probably did not grow up
with a father figure,

334
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:15,445
and she is now turning that rage toward
clients who walk out on their families.

335
00:19:15,678 --> 00:19:17,781
What's going to happen
once this woman is caught?

336
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:20,826
She'll be prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.

337
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:23,544
And the other men she's sleeping with,
the ones she doesn't kill?

338
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:25,873
- What about them?
- Will they be prosecuted?

339
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,457
Right now we're concentrating
on stopping her from killing again.

340
00:19:29,582 --> 00:19:33,111
That's all well and good, but our bosses
are going to ask us about the risks

341
00:19:33,236 --> 00:19:35,257
in cooperating
with an FBI investigation.

342
00:19:35,426 --> 00:19:38,082
Tell your employers that
the risk is not only a physical one.

343
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:40,454
She's compromising privileged
information as well.

344
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:42,824
After she sleeps with these men,
they talk to her.

345
00:19:42,949 --> 00:19:45,100
It's part of the release
they get in seeing her.

346
00:19:45,269 --> 00:19:47,436
All that dirt you've
worked so hard to cover up...

347
00:19:47,657 --> 00:19:49,501
- She knows it.
- As long as she's out there,

348
00:19:49,626 --> 00:19:51,625
it's not just your clients
that are vulnerable.

349
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,250
Your firms are, too.

350
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:55,806
Excuse me.

351
00:19:56,353 --> 00:19:57,863
I'm Allison Barnes.

352
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,512
I'm a lawyer at Webster Industries
where Joseph Fielding worked.

353
00:20:01,693 --> 00:20:03,595
This is really not the time.

354
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:06,705
We'd like to hear what she has to say.
Go ahead, ms. Barnes.

355
00:20:07,848 --> 00:20:10,159
A while back, I looked
at some paperwork

356
00:20:10,284 --> 00:20:12,714
that Mr. Fielding filed
about a penthouse downtown.

357
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:14,961
I asked him what
he'd be using it for,

358
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:17,797
and he just kind of chuckled
and said it was for a friend.

359
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,595
Is that the kind of
information you're looking for?

360
00:20:21,949 --> 00:20:23,599
Do you have an address?

361
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:44,289
Trent?

362
00:20:44,414 --> 00:20:46,100
Yes. Hi. That's me.

363
00:20:46,225 --> 00:20:47,971
Hi. Thank you for meeting me here.

364
00:20:48,096 --> 00:20:50,493
No, please, thank you.

365
00:20:52,213 --> 00:20:54,464
- May I sit?
- Yes. Oh, god, yes.

366
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:55,589
Of course.

367
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:03,770
So, let me explain something.

368
00:21:04,568 --> 00:21:06,441
Nothing's going to happen today.

369
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,749
We are just gonna chat
and get to know each other,

370
00:21:08,874 --> 00:21:11,870
and then we'll make an appointment
for later in the week.

371
00:21:11,995 --> 00:21:13,226
So, just...

372
00:21:13,739 --> 00:21:14,739
relax.

373
00:21:19,626 --> 00:21:21,726
Believe it or not, this is me...

374
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,918
Relaxed.

375
00:21:24,557 --> 00:21:25,857
- wine?
- Sure.

376
00:21:26,971 --> 00:21:29,204
I've never done anything
like this before.

377
00:21:31,028 --> 00:21:33,278
Could I see a list of '82 Bordeaux?

378
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:38,095
What I'm trying to say is that...

379
00:21:38,454 --> 00:21:40,822
It's been a while
since I've been out on...

380
00:21:41,308 --> 00:21:42,408
A date. Heh.

381
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,246
When did your wife die?

382
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,416
How did you know?

383
00:21:51,997 --> 00:21:52,997
I just do.

384
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,634
She had ovarian cancer.

385
00:22:00,089 --> 00:22:01,194
8 months ago.

386
00:22:02,186 --> 00:22:03,020
She...

387
00:22:06,545 --> 00:22:07,545
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:08,351 --> 00:22:10,538
Boy, this must really be sexy, huh?

389
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,417
You are not gonna say
the wrong thing

390
00:22:15,886 --> 00:22:17,586
or scare me away.

391
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,110
I am here for you.

392
00:22:34,362 --> 00:22:35,937
I almost didn't show up.

393
00:22:36,234 --> 00:22:37,234
How come?

394
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:39,357
'cause I was nervous.

395
00:22:39,482 --> 00:22:42,132
And... my lawyers told me
about this thing.

396
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:44,536
What thing?

397
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,278
Apparently, there's this girl...

398
00:22:49,403 --> 00:22:51,006
Woman... like you...

399
00:22:52,397 --> 00:22:54,447
Who's been killing her clients.

400
00:22:55,331 --> 00:22:56,456
Really?

401
00:22:57,153 --> 00:22:59,053
My lawyers met with the FBI.

402
00:22:59,982 --> 00:23:02,371
This woman targets CEOs

403
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:04,418
and big spenders.

404
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:06,238
How awful.

405
00:23:07,227 --> 00:23:09,618
Somebody's already spilled the beans
about a penthouse she has.

406
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,973
It's just a matter of time
till they catch her.

407
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,299
And when they do, there'll be...

408
00:23:15,424 --> 00:23:17,324
A lot of big men in trouble.

409
00:23:18,233 --> 00:23:20,774
Well, my guys seem to think
they got the FBI in their pocket.

410
00:23:20,942 --> 00:23:23,163
They won't release any names.
And if they do...

411
00:23:23,288 --> 00:23:24,988
We'll take care of them.

412
00:23:25,758 --> 00:23:27,808
The FBI knows how to play ball.

413
00:23:33,722 --> 00:23:35,369
Let's get out of here.

414
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,128
I thought there were rules.

415
00:23:43,315 --> 00:23:44,506
I am making an...

416
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:46,460
exception.

417
00:23:54,371 --> 00:23:55,630
You got anything?

418
00:23:56,686 --> 00:23:59,353
And she seems too smart
to leave a receipt laying around.

419
00:23:59,478 --> 00:24:00,928
Ruins the mystique.

420
00:24:01,412 --> 00:24:03,782
She's gotta be
whatever the customer wants.

421
00:24:03,907 --> 00:24:04,984
Look at this.

422
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:08,572
She's got a lot of high-end designer
jewelry here, and then this.

423
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:15,430
It's way too small to be an adult's.
She probably kept it from her childhood.

424
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:17,005
It's a purity ring.

425
00:24:17,262 --> 00:24:20,972
By wearing it, you promise to save
yourself for marriage.

426
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,416
She broke that promise
a long time ago.

427
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:30,837
Got a whip?

428
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,347
Antique first editions
on the bookshelves.

429
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,070
And porno in the dvd player.

430
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:39,035
Nothing identifiable. No pictures,

431
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,862
no sense of personality.

432
00:24:41,597 --> 00:24:43,721
Her lifestyle
is completely disposable.

433
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:45,859
Well, these aren't just for show.

434
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,944
The spines are cracked.
Somebody's read these.

435
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:50,304
Who reads Voltaire in French?

436
00:24:50,429 --> 00:24:51,830
Someone with good taste.

437
00:24:51,955 --> 00:24:53,267
Probably well-educated.

438
00:24:53,392 --> 00:24:56,947
We profiled that she learned
to fake privilege. What if she's not?

439
00:24:57,072 --> 00:24:59,414
You're saying maybe
she came from money the whole time?

440
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:00,360
Maybe.

441
00:25:00,935 --> 00:25:03,459
Prentiss answer. If it's a customer,
she'll get more information.

442
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,706
Unless she's calling
in for her messages.

443
00:25:06,398 --> 00:25:08,815
We're getting a call to this line.
Can you work some magic?

444
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,243
I don't have a trap-and-trace
in place yet. Give me a few.

445
00:25:11,368 --> 00:25:12,468
<i>Istay on the line.</i>

446
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,708
She's gonna work it.
Prentiss, get ready to vamp.

447
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:16,848
Hi, it's me.
You know what to do.

448
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:20,598
<i>I know you're up there.</i>

449
00:25:20,723 --> 00:25:21,723
<i>Pick up.</i>

450
00:25:35,637 --> 00:25:38,272
I'm at a disadvantage.
You seem to know my name,

451
00:25:38,818 --> 00:25:40,621
but I don't know yours.
Can we start there?

452
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,459
I thought I could trust you, Aaron.

453
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,586
- Who says you can't?
- <i>I want to.</i>

454
00:25:47,055 --> 00:25:48,955
I even looked you up online.

455
00:25:49,489 --> 00:25:52,050
- Is that strange?
- <i>No. It's flattering</i>

456
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:53,859
to be noticed by a woman like you.

457
00:25:53,984 --> 00:25:55,554
<i>And I thought you were so...</i>

458
00:25:56,043 --> 00:25:57,043
Upstanding.

459
00:25:58,164 --> 00:26:00,683
I watched the presentation
you gave on school shootings.

460
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,602
I found it posted on youtube.

461
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,546
And for a moment, I actually thought

462
00:26:04,671 --> 00:26:06,755
there were still
good people in the world.

463
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,357
<i>But I've disappointed you.?</i>

464
00:26:08,808 --> 00:26:11,767
Just like all the other men in your life
who've walked out on their families,

465
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:14,989
- who deserve to be punished.
- Did you walk out on your family?

466
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:17,694
No. My wife left me.

467
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,119
- <i>Do you have kids?</i>
- I have a son.

468
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,580
- How often do you see him?
- <i>I try to see him every week.</i>

469
00:26:23,294 --> 00:26:24,931
Do you see him every week?

470
00:26:25,056 --> 00:26:27,656
No, I don't get there
as often as I want.

471
00:26:29,307 --> 00:26:30,474
I believe you.

472
00:26:30,599 --> 00:26:33,050
But don't compare yourself
to the men I see.

473
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:34,671
You are nothing

474
00:26:35,488 --> 00:26:36,640
like them.

475
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,727
- You're just another whore.
- How am I a whore?

476
00:26:45,025 --> 00:26:47,438
You come when called.
You do their bidding.

477
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,816
<i>My guys seem to think
they got the FBI in their pocket.</i>

478
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,777
In hotels you take
the side elevator to avoid crowds,

479
00:26:53,139 --> 00:26:54,946
<i>while the men who pay your salary</i>

480
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:57,657
walk across the ivory
marble foyer into their cars.

481
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,743
I'm in on the land line,
triangulating the cell.

482
00:27:00,911 --> 00:27:02,310
<i>Give me like 60 seconds.</i>

483
00:27:02,435 --> 00:27:05,681
- But I'm just frustrating you.
- What do you mean?

484
00:27:05,806 --> 00:27:07,927
<i>You want to show the world
all these bad men</i>

485
00:27:08,052 --> 00:27:10,418
and my investigation's
just getting in your way.

486
00:27:12,483 --> 00:27:14,283
<i>You're not doing your job!</i>

487
00:27:14,852 --> 00:27:17,510
You don't want to arrest me,
you don't want me in custody,

488
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,097
because you're in their pocket.

489
00:27:19,222 --> 00:27:20,513
<i>We'll take care of them.</i>

490
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,666
You just want me to disappear,
just like they do.

491
00:27:23,791 --> 00:27:26,814
<i>Truthfully, I'm only
interested in finding you.</i>

492
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:29,330
<i>You've been betrayed so many times,
you don't know who to trust,</i>

493
00:27:29,455 --> 00:27:31,399
and that's why
that 1st murder felt so good.

494
00:27:31,578 --> 00:27:34,068
But each one since has
been less and less satisfying.

495
00:27:34,447 --> 00:27:37,693
<i>You know that's going to continue.
Am I right?</i>

496
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:42,348
Come to me and turn yourself in.

497
00:27:43,268 --> 00:27:45,225
I will make sure
that you get the help you need.

498
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,622
I won't let you disappear.

499
00:27:49,673 --> 00:27:52,067
If we met under
different circumstances...

500
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:55,033
I could believe that.

501
00:27:57,411 --> 00:27:59,350
I won't let you cover this up.

502
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,723
Garcia, talk to me.

503
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,099
Oh, my God, was that...

504
00:28:27,856 --> 00:28:29,224
<i>Channel 9 news room.</i>

505
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:31,469
I just heard gunshots
in a parking lot.

506
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:33,044
Corinth and Michigan.

507
00:28:33,805 --> 00:28:35,527
I think somebody might be dead.

508
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:48,905
Got it! 1818 corinth avenue.

509
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:13,240
<i>Don't compare yourself
to the men I see.</i>

510
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:14,871
<i>You are nothing like them.</i>

511
00:29:15,581 --> 00:29:16,929
You're just another whore.

512
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,043
Her use of the word
whore is interesting.

513
00:29:20,168 --> 00:29:23,435
It suggests she's trying to disassociate
herself from her actions.

514
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,782
But she's become more
personal with theurders.

515
00:29:25,907 --> 00:29:28,031
She's changed her m.o.
from poison to a gun.

516
00:29:28,156 --> 00:29:29,590
And she changed her victimology.

517
00:29:29,715 --> 00:29:33,209
Trent Rabner was faithful to his wife
until she died. They didn't have kids.

518
00:29:33,334 --> 00:29:36,497
Her whole justification for who's worth
killing and who isn't is gone.

519
00:29:36,622 --> 00:29:39,423
She's obviously devolving.
This is gonna be ugly.

520
00:29:39,548 --> 00:29:42,382
She's the type who could go on a spree
and take out anyone she sees as target.

521
00:29:42,507 --> 00:29:45,374
Could we go to the end just
before she pulls the trigger?

522
00:29:46,671 --> 00:29:49,121
<i>Well, you want to show
the world all these bad men</i>

523
00:29:49,246 --> 00:29:52,196
<i>and my investigation's
just getting in your way.</i>

524
00:29:53,245 --> 00:29:55,384
<i>You're not doing your job!</i>

525
00:29:55,851 --> 00:29:58,607
<i>You don't want to arrest me,
you don't want me in custody,</i>

526
00:29:58,732 --> 00:30:00,352
<i>because you're in their pocket.</i>

527
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:03,443
<i>You just want me to disappear,
just like they do.</i>

528
00:30:03,568 --> 00:30:06,253
- Who's "they"?
- The men she sleeps with, I'm assuming?

529
00:30:06,378 --> 00:30:09,401
No, it's bigger than that now.
She's lumping Hotch in with the lawyers.

530
00:30:09,526 --> 00:30:12,952
So maybe it's anyone in a position
of power who could cover this up.

531
00:30:13,077 --> 00:30:14,144
Cover her up.

532
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:16,238
The purity ring you found...
You said it was tiny?

533
00:30:16,457 --> 00:30:19,074
- Only a little girl could wear it.
- She wouldn't buy that for herself.

534
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,534
It was a gift.

535
00:30:20,882 --> 00:30:23,078
Maybe she's talking
about her father.

536
00:30:23,565 --> 00:30:26,810
If her father was like these CEOs,
he probably walked out on her, too.

537
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,626
OK, so, you're rich,
you decide to start sleeping with men

538
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:32,061
who are like your father
to get back at him.

539
00:30:32,186 --> 00:30:33,791
How do you go about finding clients?

540
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:35,970
Could she have started
with the service?

541
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,977
She wouldn't need to. The madam says
that she trains these girls

542
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:40,414
how to act around these men.

543
00:30:40,539 --> 00:30:43,223
- Our unsub knows how to do that.
- She said something else, too.

544
00:30:43,348 --> 00:30:46,852
She said that your client list
was like your 401k.

545
00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:48,604
You sell it.

546
00:30:48,772 --> 00:30:51,732
So maybe our unsub bought her
client list from another call girl.

547
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,525
It makes sense.

548
00:30:53,694 --> 00:30:56,348
They're expensive names. Only someone
who came from money could afford it.

549
00:30:56,473 --> 00:30:58,071
So who's recently retired?

550
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:00,462
You're kidding.

551
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:03,002
You keep tabs on who
your clients sleep with.

552
00:31:03,127 --> 00:31:05,124
You know who got out of the game.

553
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:08,081
You're asking me to violate
attorney-client privilege.

554
00:31:08,249 --> 00:31:10,675
We're asking you to help us
catch a killer.

555
00:31:13,286 --> 00:31:15,546
Well, let's say that
your profile is correct

556
00:31:15,671 --> 00:31:18,071
and she is the daughter
of my client.

557
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,790
If I do this, I'm gonna need
immunity on the back end.

558
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,223
Come on, boys, give it up.

559
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,900
I mean, you two know
how this game is played.

560
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:30,125
Yes, we do.
So here's the deal.

561
00:31:30,318 --> 00:31:31,897
Give us the information we want

562
00:31:32,143 --> 00:31:34,640
or I'll arrest you on
the spot for obstruction of justice.

563
00:31:34,765 --> 00:31:36,761
And while you're sitting
in Dallas central booking

564
00:31:36,886 --> 00:31:38,634
waiting to make your one phone call,

565
00:31:38,759 --> 00:31:41,583
i'll have the entire white
collar division from the FBI here

566
00:31:41,708 --> 00:31:44,125
from quantico, and they'll
turn your offices upside down

567
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,827
until we find what we want.

568
00:31:46,059 --> 00:31:47,359
That's my offer.

569
00:31:54,769 --> 00:31:56,505
I'd take that if I were you.

570
00:32:07,016 --> 00:32:08,392
We're looking for katherine.

571
00:32:09,031 --> 00:32:11,520
- You have the wrong house.
- We're not interested in you.

572
00:32:11,706 --> 00:32:13,635
but the woman who bought your list.

573
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:17,776
Go play with your toys, OK?

574
00:32:21,995 --> 00:32:23,740
- Come in.
- Thank you.

575
00:32:29,127 --> 00:32:30,330
Her name is Megan.

576
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:32,641
Megan Kane.

577
00:32:34,358 --> 00:32:36,105
And her father
was a client of yours?

578
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,672
Andrew. He was one of my 8 regulars.

579
00:32:38,914 --> 00:32:42,175
He's a VP at
Ebbett oil now, I think.

580
00:32:42,407 --> 00:32:45,527
- I saw him for 6 years.
- And does your son...

581
00:32:45,652 --> 00:32:49,652
No. After I retired, I... wanted
something good in my life.

582
00:32:49,894 --> 00:32:52,477
6 years is a long time
to see one call girl.

583
00:32:52,702 --> 00:32:55,449
Most men only have room
for one affair at a time.

584
00:32:55,588 --> 00:32:57,149
How did Megan know about you?

585
00:32:58,264 --> 00:33:01,014
Andrew left his wife because of me.

586
00:33:02,436 --> 00:33:03,736
Of course, he...

587
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,429
married someone else,

588
00:33:05,554 --> 00:33:08,802
but... I wasn't surprised
when Megan knocked on my door.

589
00:33:08,927 --> 00:33:11,716
You must have been surprised
she wanted your list.

590
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:15,168
Megan had all kinds
of opportunities in life.

591
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,360
Didn't you wonder why she wanted
to follow your career path?

592
00:33:19,284 --> 00:33:21,383
Megan didn't want to be a call girl.

593
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:24,843
- She didn't?
- She wanted me to go away.

594
00:33:25,803 --> 00:33:29,457
She said that after
I ruined her parents' marriage

595
00:33:29,582 --> 00:33:31,016
that I ruined her life, too.

596
00:33:32,763 --> 00:33:35,270
She bought my list
so that nobody else would.

597
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:42,298
So here's what we know about Megan Kane.
Her parents divorced 8 years ago.

598
00:33:42,423 --> 00:33:44,529
After the divorce,
she traveled internationally.

599
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:45,697
We're not sure...

600
00:33:45,865 --> 00:33:46,698
<i>Long night?</i>

601
00:33:47,076 --> 00:33:49,002
... fell off the grid,
which is easier to do

602
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,212
when you're making
thousands of dollars a night.

603
00:33:51,337 --> 00:33:53,788
Put a trace on her father,
communication, accounts, the whole nine.

604
00:33:53,956 --> 00:33:57,083
I also forwarded the picture
to Dallas p.d. and upscale hotels.

605
00:33:57,251 --> 00:33:58,418
<i>Excuse me.</i>

606
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,213
I saw her 2 nights ago
in the elevator of my hotel.

607
00:34:02,235 --> 00:34:05,800
Call Ebbett Oil. Tell Mr. Kane I need
to meet with him as soon as possible.

608
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:09,012
- You have the wrong woman.
- No, we don't.

609
00:34:09,268 --> 00:34:13,516
Is this how the FBI does their job now,
making random accusations?

610
00:34:14,198 --> 00:34:16,648
She kept the purity ring
you gave her?

611
00:34:17,046 --> 00:34:19,813
We found it in a penthouse that
one of her customers rented for her.

612
00:34:19,938 --> 00:34:21,251
Andrew, don't say anything.

613
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:24,237
When you cut off your ex-wife,
you cut off Megan, too.

614
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:27,530
We still think you can help us
if you can contact Megan.

615
00:34:28,114 --> 00:34:29,282
We're done here.

616
00:34:36,724 --> 00:34:39,891
We have a tail on Kane at his home
and office. We sure this is gonna work?

617
00:34:40,016 --> 00:34:41,904
He knows where Megan is.
He'll contact her.

618
00:34:42,029 --> 00:34:44,047
To protect his reputation
if nothing else.

619
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:45,523
<i>I might have something.</i>

620
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:47,645
<i>Andrew Kane reserved
a room at the Wilmore hotel,</i>

621
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:49,178
<i>room 2257 to be exact.</i>

622
00:34:49,303 --> 00:34:51,950
<i>Can I get an ick-ick-icky on making
an appointment with your own daughter?</i>

623
00:34:52,075 --> 00:34:53,890
Megan won't show up until
Kane's there.

624
00:34:54,058 --> 00:34:56,198
JJ, tell nobody to move
until we get there.

625
00:35:06,881 --> 00:35:09,781
We haven't seen Kane
or his daughter down here.

626
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:12,117
There's a lot of entrances.
We could have missed one.

627
00:35:12,285 --> 00:35:13,735
Stay where you are.

628
00:35:23,425 --> 00:35:24,838
FBI. Don't move.

629
00:35:26,146 --> 00:35:27,519
He told me to show up here.

630
00:35:27,644 --> 00:35:29,175
They could be anywhere.

631
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:43,832
How could you?

632
00:35:43,957 --> 00:35:45,307
How could I what?

633
00:35:45,826 --> 00:35:47,093
Embarrass you?

634
00:35:47,826 --> 00:35:49,229
Fail you?

635
00:35:49,472 --> 00:35:50,523
My God, Megan.

636
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:53,130
Those men... They were good men.

637
00:35:53,255 --> 00:35:56,837
Those men? Let me tell you about
how good those men were, dad.

638
00:35:56,962 --> 00:35:59,326
- I'm not going to listen...
- Hoyt Ashford liketo play pretend.

639
00:35:59,495 --> 00:36:02,028
Except the bruises
that he left weren't pretend.

640
00:36:02,153 --> 00:36:04,055
- You stop it.
- Michael Stanton...

641
00:36:04,861 --> 00:36:08,835
You spoke with him at a conference.
You know who he liked to watch me with?

642
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:11,483
- I will not let you talk to me.
- I even asked about you.

643
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:14,883
I wanted to know whatthey did
that was so much better than mom.

644
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:16,452
Shut your mouth!

645
00:36:22,992 --> 00:36:25,145
That's what they told me you liked.

646
00:36:34,086 --> 00:36:37,278
There are 4 luxury hotels in the area
that the unsub frequents.

647
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:39,119
We could split up,
but we'll go in blind.

648
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:41,055
Ivory Marble.
She mentioned it on the phone.

649
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,244
The men who walk through
the Ivory Marble foyer.

650
00:36:43,427 --> 00:36:44,735
The Chase Regent.

651
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,010
Are you sure?

652
00:36:46,135 --> 00:36:48,917
Andrew liked it there. He said
that the staff was very discreet.

653
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:52,139
Let's set up a perimeter when we get
there. Nobody gets in or out.

654
00:36:54,159 --> 00:36:56,237
- The FBI knows who you are.
- I know.

655
00:37:03,081 --> 00:37:04,640
If you want to punish me...

656
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:07,036
fine.

657
00:37:08,671 --> 00:37:11,322
But don't do it
by destroying yourself.

658
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:13,733
Let me protect you.

659
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:14,758
How?

660
00:37:16,247 --> 00:37:17,529
We'll turn you in.

661
00:37:17,933 --> 00:37:20,532
My lawyers can post bail.
We'll get you out of the country.

662
00:37:20,802 --> 00:37:23,451
Of course. Ship me off,
let me be somebody else's problem.

663
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,025
For god's sake, Megan.

664
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:29,290
You're my little girl.

665
00:37:33,658 --> 00:37:34,747
I love you.

666
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,932
Let me save your life.

667
00:37:46,346 --> 00:37:47,444
I'm scared.

668
00:37:51,441 --> 00:37:52,313
I know.

669
00:37:57,063 --> 00:37:58,163
It'll be OK.

670
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,198
Will you stay with me?

671
00:38:05,313 --> 00:38:06,327
Do you promise?

672
00:38:16,948 --> 00:38:19,132
- I need something.
- What?

673
00:38:21,318 --> 00:38:22,427
Your client list.

674
00:38:33,141 --> 00:38:35,231
- What are you gonna do with it?
- Hide it.

675
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:38,991
If the FBI finds it,
they'll prosecute you for all 4 murders.

676
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:40,866
You'll never be released.

677
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:43,859
Hold on.

678
00:38:44,116 --> 00:38:45,909
Just give me a second.

679
00:39:01,718 --> 00:39:02,925
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

680
00:39:17,215 --> 00:39:18,615
We're out of time.

681
00:39:21,413 --> 00:39:23,279
This is it.
It's my contacts, my clients.

682
00:39:26,103 --> 00:39:27,103
Everything.

683
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,873
I'll see you at the police station.

684
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:42,322
We'll get through this.

685
00:40:16,712 --> 00:40:17,834
Easy.

686
00:40:17,959 --> 00:40:18,959
You sure?

687
00:40:19,706 --> 00:40:21,406
It's over. She knows it.

688
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:23,448
I'll call 911.

689
00:40:29,501 --> 00:40:30,763
Nothing will change.

690
00:40:32,288 --> 00:40:35,810
They'll just go back to doing whatever
they want and keep getting away with it.

691
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:38,391
Not if I have anything
to do with it.

692
00:40:48,408 --> 00:40:51,417
who was it who said,
"you don't pay a prostitute for sex,

693
00:40:51,542 --> 00:40:53,077
you pay her to leave afterwards"?

694
00:40:53,401 --> 00:40:54,711
It was Dashiell Hammett.

695
00:40:54,836 --> 00:40:56,436
It doesn't make sense.

696
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:58,541
The men always leave first.

697
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:10,218
I'd give anything
to see his face right now.

698
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:27,275
How could your wife have
ever left someone like you?

699
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:31,242
You're the first man I ever met
who didn't let me down.

700
00:41:36,022 --> 00:41:37,288
Will you stay with me?

701
00:41:38,891 --> 00:41:39,891
Promise?

702
00:41:40,868 --> 00:41:41,702
Promise.

703
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,307
Sir, roll your window down.

704
00:41:52,432 --> 00:41:54,232
Roll your window down now.

705
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,052
<i>Dallas companies were rocked today</i>

706
00:41:56,177 --> 00:41:58,146
<i>as a list was found
of men who were rumored...</i>

707
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:00,545
<i>Andrew Kane resigned amid allegations</i>

708
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:03,992
<i>of ties to an escort
who was reportedly killing her clients.</i>

709
00:42:04,117 --> 00:42:05,012
Let's talk.

710
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:09,593
<i>The attorney general insisted that he
wasn't responsible for the leak ofnames.</i>

711
00:42:09,718 --> 00:42:13,284
<i>Kane refused to comment,
but sources say he was the father.</i>
