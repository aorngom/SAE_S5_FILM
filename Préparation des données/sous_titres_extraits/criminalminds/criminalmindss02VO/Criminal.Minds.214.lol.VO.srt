1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,760
E back in miami.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,860
Welcome,friends. Jim nance along with phil simms.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,160
Super bowl xli is in the books,

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,710
and,phil,as you look back on it now,what was the turning point?

5
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,130
Well,like most games,jim,especially super bowls,it's about turnovers.

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:13,660
That's what happened here today.

7
00:00:13,670 --> 00:00:15,070
But when I talk about turnovers,

8
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:16,850
I have a different take on it.

9
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:18,470
I look at it as takeaways.

10
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,820
The winning team is always the most physical.

11
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,810
They hit the opposing quarterback,they make him throw interceptions,

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,760
they hit the running back extra hard--

13
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:28,340
well,football is over until next year.

14
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,140
Oh,which means I get sundays with my husband back.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,370
I already miss it.

16
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:34,220
Hey!

17
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,710
Oh,no,you didn't!

18
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,690
Oh! No,no,no.

19
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,760
I didn't mean it that way.

20
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,210
Well,then--then how did you mean it?

21
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,270
Just that I'll miss the,uh-- I don't know.

22
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,570
No,no,don't do it.

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,500
Just beg for her forgiveness and move on!

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,500
Captioning made possible by touchstone television productions,llc and cbs oh,that is so wrong!

25
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,590
Do you count what he drinks?

26
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,330
Yeah,sometimes.

27
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,910
Do you count my-- my beers?

28
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,070
What?

29
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,220
I don't want to do this.

30
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,770
The others are leaving now.

31
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:15,120
Go around back.

32
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,950
Well,get home safe,you guys.

33
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:31,190
Oh,don't worry,I'm driving.

34
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,940
Didn't men use to the bosses?

35
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,100
Hey,I'm already in trouble.

36
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:41,890
Yeah.

37
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:43,590
Smart boy.

38
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,860
Bye,you guys.

39
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:46,840
Good night.

40
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,550
Ah.

41
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,590
Can we let this wait till morning?

42
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,940
No,let's just do a little.

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,930
Come on.

44
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,390
All right. I'm gonna take the garbage out.

45
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,210
Ok.

46
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,550
Honey,did you leave the back door open?

47
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,800
What?

48
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:14,580
Nothing,never mind.

49
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,470
Hey,lena can finish the rest.

50
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,430
Lena can barely finish what she has to do on a normal monday.

51
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,780
Come on,I want to go to bed.

52
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:40,830
Oh,dennis!

53
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,860
Hey,i know how I can make up that horrible comment to you.

54
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,610
You are kidding me,right?

55
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,300
We can start on that special sunday together.

56
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,120
No,well,I could get you a football helmet that you could make out with.

57
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:53,750
Oh,that's ridiculous.

58
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,260
Come with me.

59
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,820
I love it when you drink.

60
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,590
A glass of champagne?

61
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,350
9-1-1,what's your emergency?

62
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,060
I'm at 1527 chestnut drive.

63
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,060
I know where you're calling fro calling from.

64
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:19,240
What's the emergency?

65
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,030
He thinks they're too greedy.

66
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,330
They have too much.

67
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,230
Too much what?

68
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,220
Stuff,you know,possessions.

69
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,870
Things they don't need. Hurry!

70
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:29,620
You're calling because these people have too much stuff?

71
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:31,590
No,I'm calling because raphael--

72
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,860
That's enough.

73
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,980
I know why he's calling,because raphael is going to kill the sinners that live here.

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,790
I'm sorry,did you say someone is killing somebody?

75
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,730
sir? hello?

76
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,260
face forward and be careful!

77
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,090
Want to look back and check your wallet.

78
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:04,150
It's all right,I'll be a broke,happy man.

79
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,890
Cheers!

80
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,390
Cheers!

81
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,780
How are they treating you at the B.A.U.,Emily?

82
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:16,000
She means,am I being nice to you?

83
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,290
Actually,everyone has been incredibly nice.

84
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,890
Look at him move.

85
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:24,380
it's like a cat.

86
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,010
More like a dog!

87
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:27,780
He did not ask them to dance.

88
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,390
They asked him.

89
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,820
Ok.

90
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,440
Ok,he's a cat.

91
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,340
An alley cat.

92
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,160
Come on,haley,let's go show them how it's done.

93
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:35,800
Oh!

94
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:38,250
Game if you are!

95
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,160
Push it to the limit that is so sweet.

96
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,450
I'm going to the loo.

97
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,190
Do not let anyone steal my seat.

98
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,440
XXXXXXXXXX

99
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,360
oh!

100
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,880
Another perfect toss!

101
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,720
How did you get so good at this?

102
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,030
Where I grew up,darts was like a national sport.

103
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:56,970
Seriously?

104
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,280
Yeah,we were too small for a bowling alley.

105
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,110
Ah.

106
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,280
Oh!

107
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,650
Sorry,boys,you're gonna have to find someone else to humiliate you.

108
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:08,740
Oh,ok.

109
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:12,660
XXXXXXXXX

110
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,310
return to tomorrow.

111
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,580
Return to tomorrow,season 2,production number 51,

112
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,250
an alien entity,sargon,takes over kirk's body 

113
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,900
while 2 others kick over spock and dr. Mulhall.

114
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,490
Alien race or terran?

115
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:24,150
Trick question.

116
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,090
A race is never identified.

117
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,070
Sargon is a disembodied mind.

118
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,950
What did dr. Mccoy quote?

119
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,150
5...

120
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,260
4...

121
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,140
3...

122
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,620
2...

123
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,870
"I will not peddle flesh.

124
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,300
I'm a physician.

125
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,790
" Drink!

126
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,780
I'm sorry.

127
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,610
Will you say that again?

128
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,980
Ok.

129
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,930
Um,have the police fax over everything they have so far.

130
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,580
I'll take care of the notifications,most everyone's here with me.

131
00:05:57,650 --> 00:05:59,950
Thank you.

132
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,100
WASHINGTON D.C

133
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,100
The Smithsonian Institude

134
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,500
Last,but not least,a special treat for your annual super bowl visit.

135
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,700
Something new?

136
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,130
As soon as it came in,I knew you'd want to see it.

137
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:25,860
An original hand-colored audubon etching entitled turdus polyglottus.

138
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,440
Or the mockingbird.

139
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,690
It's gorgeous.

140
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:32,390
See how they fight the rattlesnake for their nest?

141
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,800
They have no concern for their own safety.

142
00:06:34,850 --> 00:06:36,430
I can see why you'd be drawn to it.

143
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,650
You know,they can emulate the cries of over 30 different species,

144
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,100
from hummingbirds to eagles,other animals,

145
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,760
even machinery.

146
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,320
They are incredible.

147
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,180
J.J.

148
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:58,820
I'll meet you at the office.

149
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,900
Rattlesnake in someone's nest?

150
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,650
I'm sorry we couldn't spend more time together.

151
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:05,630
Thanks a lot.

152
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:20,250
What did we do? ...

153
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,390
It was redemption.

154
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:49,290
It wasn't god's breath...

155
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:57,720
What did we do?

156
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,520
You know,it never fails.

157
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:12,480
Just as I'm getting my groove thing going,bam.

158
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,710
We're back at the B.A.U.

159
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,120
You know,statistically a case doesn't come in with any more frequency

160
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,090
if you're at a party or a gathering and if you aren'T.

161
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,180
It's a trick of the mind.

162
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,320
We merely remember the ones that came in that way more.

163
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,970
So is it really that hard for you to get your groove "thang" going again?

164
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,710
Only when he's sleeping.

165
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,940
Where were you tonight?

166
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,710
I told you,I went to the smithsonian.

167
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,040
You missed a good time.

168
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,460
I had a good time.

169
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,460
Well,that's definitely over.

170
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,670
Georgia.

171
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:41,370
The kyles dennis and lacy were murdered an hour ago in their suburban atlanta home.

172
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,400
An hour ago?

173
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,080
Police were on scene unusually fast.

174
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,890
Why?

175
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,040
One of the unsubs called them and told them that the other was about to mder the victims.

176
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:49,910
You're kidding.

177
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:51,200
From inside the house.

178
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,640
According to the dispatcher,

179
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,510
the first male sounded terrified and begged them to get there before the other,

180
00:08:55,570 --> 00:08:58,640
who they both identified as raphael,

181
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,660
was about to kill the sinners that lived there.

182
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,690
Sinners?

183
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,210
The 9-1-1 center is going to send garcia a copy of the tape.

184
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,900
How fast was the police response time?

185
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,690
4 minutes,26 seconds.

186
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,470
During which time...

187
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:11,650
raphael managed to do this.

188
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:13,500
In 4 1/2 minutes?

189
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,530
Mr. Kyle is a dot com millionaire.

190
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,110
His company is one of the largest employers in the community.

191
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,750
There's gonna be media coverage.

192
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,380
Also,when they arrived,

193
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,820
the police found this displayed prominently on the bed.

194
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,460
Revelations chapter 6,erse 8.

195
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,780
They're killing sinners.

196
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,010
These guys are on a mission.

197
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:31,840
And mission-based killers will not stop killing.

198
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,680
And I looked in behold a pale horse,

199
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:38,280
and his name that sat upon m was death.

200
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:41,400
And hell followed with him.

201
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,710
This isn't right.

202
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,100
Ye shall walk after the lord,your god,

203
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,560
and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice,

204
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,070
and you shall serve him,

205
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,160
and cleave unto him.

206
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,510
You don't serve god that way.

207
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:03,820
You don't question me,boy!

208
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,450
Clean yourself up and quit whining.

209
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,420
You done the lord's work today.

210
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:29,970
Hey!

211
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,480
No,PLEASE!

212
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,690
Now you stay right there.

213
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:50,880
Book tells us that we ain't to serve the lord until we are sealed,boy.

214
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:57,160
Sealed with god's mark.

215
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,320
Sealed in our forehead.

216
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,250
Condemned murderer perry smith said of his victims,the clutter family,

217
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,870
I didn't have anything against them,and they never did anything wrong to me,

218
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,460
the way other people have all my life.

219
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,070
Maybe they're just the ones who have to pay for it.

220
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,480
This is a bad one,isn't it?

221
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,120
Unsubs with a cause are never good.

222
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,750
Pets,I just got the 9-1-1 call from the georgia state police.

223
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:41,590
9-1-1,what's your emergency?

224
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,180
I'm at 1527 chestnut drive.

225
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:45,260
I know where you're calling fro calling from.

226
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,470
What's the emergency?

227
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,270
He thinks they're too greedy.

228
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,590
They have too much.

229
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,550
Too much what?

230
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,760
Stuff,you know,possessions. Things they don't need. 

231
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,360
Hurry!

232
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,470
You're calling because these people have too much stuff?

233
00:12:56,510 --> 00:12:58,800
No,I'm calling because raphael--

234
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,790
That's enough.

235
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,990
I know why he's calling,because raphael is going to kill the sinners that live here.

236
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,050
I'm sorry,did you say someone is killing somebody?

237
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,010
Well,unsub one definitely sounds frightened.

238
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,840
Maybe he's doing this against his will.

239
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,790
I doubt it.

240
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:13,610
He whispered.

241
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,250
He could have called out to save them instead of calling 9-1-1.

242
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,630
Not if he had a gun to his head.

243
00:13:17,670 --> 00:13:20,250
If he had a gun to his head,why would he have dialed 9-1-1?

244
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,750
The second unsub said raphael was going to kill someone.

245
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:24,810
Is there a third?

246
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,720
Referring to oneself in the third person is not uncommon for an unsub.

247
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:30,160
Ted bundy gave thoroughly detailed accounts of his murders,

248
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,130
but he never actually admitted to doing it.

249
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,210
He would just say,"the killer.

250
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,050
Ok,so I'm gonna go ahead and the name raphael 

251
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,310
through the georgia criminal databases as well as our own.

252
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,390
Thanks,garcia.

253
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,670
Ever so welcome,my liege.

254
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,190
We have a killing team on a mission in rural georgia.

255
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,190
We know what that means.

256
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:47,040
They're not gonna stop until the mission's complete.

257
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:48,100
We need to hit the ground running.

258
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,020
J.J.,We need an inside picture of the victims.

259
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,630
Victimology can be critically important in a mission-based spree.

260
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:54,000
Already on it.

261
00:13:54,030 --> 00:13:55,190
Prentiss,go where the bodies are.

262
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,380
Examine the wounds.

263
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,490
They managed to kill 2 victims in 4 1/2 minutes.

264
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,190
- You got it.

265
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:00,190
- We need to know how.

266
00:14:00,190 --> 00:14:03,450
I'm gonna set up at the atlanta field office and go over case files from the state.

267
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,350
It would be highly unusual for a first kill to be this efficient.

268
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:09,110
Reid,you and morgan,come with me to the crime scene.

269
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:13,100
We land in less than an hour. Everybody try to get some rest.

270
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,060
You all right?

271
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,660
What?

272
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,880
You seem unhappy.

273
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,620
I am unhappy.

274
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,070
Tired of people using religion to 

275
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,400
justify the terrible things they do.

276
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,180
You're saying these killers are on a mission?

277
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,450
These unsubs believe they're either on a mission from god 

278
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,480
or that the bible was somehow guiding them.

279
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,560
Unsubs?

280
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,230
That stands for unknown subjects.

281
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,310
The killers,working as a team.

282
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,140
It sounded to me like only one of them was into the mission.

283
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,060
It's usually more complicated than even that.

284
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:51,080
In the case of dick hickock and perry smith,

285
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,990
perry was the subservient personality.

286
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,990
Basically against even entering the clutter home,

287
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:59,390
and yet he was the one who almost single-handedly slaughtered the entire family.

288
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:00,950
Huh.

289
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,530
How many times was mr. Kyle stabbed?

290
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,090
Stabbed...

291
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,330
isn't exactly the word.

292
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:10,210
They're all long,deep gashes.

293
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,970
Each victim has virtually the same wounds--

294
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:17,750
 both throats cut,a vertical gash up one arm from wrist to elbow,

295
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:21,420
and a vertical gash down one leg from crotch to upper thigh.

296
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,650
Major arteries.

297
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,780
It's damned efficient.

298
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,400
How much knowledge of anatomy would someone need to do this?

299
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,870
Anyone with a basic understanding of the body knows where these arteries are.

300
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:35,190
And do you have any idea which one of these wounds was delivered first?

301
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,650
Um,there was a-- 

302
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:40,070
there was active blood flow from each of the wounds,

303
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,340
so they're probably all delivered at about the same time.

304
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,640
With any of these wounds,

305
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,340
the victim would bleed out quickly,

306
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:49,780
almost like an animal at slaughter.

307
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,470
No.

308
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,680
Exactly like an animal at slaughter.

309
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:57,310
A deer or a lamb or a cow,something like that.

310
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:00,380
You--you cut the throat first,then--

311
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:04,010
then sometimes open up other major arteries to assist in draining the carcass.

312
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,240
So,maybe a hunter?

313
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,090
Or a farmer.

314
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,870
Pretty much anyone in rur georgia.

315
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,740
Oh.

316
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,780
So,I just talked to the gentries.

317
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,940
They were the last couple to leave the super bowl party.

318
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:25,020
According to them,the kyles didn't have any enemies.

319
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,900
They were good to their employees,

320
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:28,850
more generous then they needed to be.

321
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,260
They were just generally good people.

322
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,220
So why them?

323
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,300
Well,if the trigger's greed,

324
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,580
they do have a nice house.

325
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:37,240
Yeah,but you can't tell that from the street.

326
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:40,070
These people were chosen,and we need to know why and how.

327
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,940
I pulled everything we have unsolved in the last 2 years.

328
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,650
Nothing even close to the M.O.

329
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,100
No murders involving a knife?

330
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:47,950
We have a lot of open cases involving knives,

331
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,740
but they're in common type crimes,bar fights,robberies.

332
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,140
Well,this isn't their first contact.

333
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:56,120
One of them has experience.

334
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,770
Is it ok if I go through some of your case files?

335
00:16:58,770 --> 00:16:59,940
Fresh eyes.

336
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:03,230
There's nothing there.

337
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,960
Help me out,ok?

338
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:08,730
These guys,they're not gonna let me do anything else,

339
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:13,330
and I flew all the way here,so...

340
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,080
I'll show you the file room.

341
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,940
This is an unincorporated area.

342
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,080
We're stretched pretty thin,manpower-wise.

343
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,710
That's why we couldn't get here any faster after the guy called.

344
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:30,700
4 1/2 minutes,that's a pretty good response time.

345
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,680
Yeah,that's on par with new york city's response time.

346
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,010
4.3 minutes.

347
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:35,850
And they've got a hell of a lot more cops per capita.

348
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:37,610
This unsub was good.

349
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,930
You didn't really have a chance.

350
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:42,140
Ok,I know my partner called 9-1-1.

351
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,090
The police are on the way,so I don't have a lot of time.

352
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,490
Now,assuming unsub one didn't actively participate,

353
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:51,590
I gotta believe I entered the bedroom fr here.

354
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:53,730
I see mr. Kyle on the other side of the bed.

355
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:58,180
So I approach him.

356
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,380
And I cut him first.

357
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,430
Well,how do you know that?

358
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,530
A blitz attacker neutralizes the greatest threat first.

359
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,030
In this case,it would be the man.

360
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:06,630
Plus a 9-1-1 call.

361
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:08,070
Woman screamed.

362
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,890
You can't scream with your throat cut.

363
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,870
So mrs. Kyle sees her husband murdered.

364
00:18:11,890 --> 00:18:14,880
She runs back into the bathroom.

365
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:18,330
Excuse me,man.

366
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:20,930
She tries to close the door behind her.

367
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:24,510
I force my way in.

368
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:27,450
And I kill mrs. Kyle back here in the bathroom.

369
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,650
We checked that smudge for prints.

370
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:30,820
Nothing.

371
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,880
Looks like he wore some gloves.

372
00:18:32,930 --> 00:18:34,180
Not with any pattern.

373
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,430
Like latex maybe.

374
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,360
That doesn't make any sense at all.

375
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,190
It doesn't?

376
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,610
Unsubs suffering from a psychopathy,

377
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,330
a delusion,like a message from god,

378
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,450
or what we could classify as being disorganized.

379
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:45,560
They don't generally clean up after themselves.

380
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,390
You know,maybe unsub one,the frightened one,made sure they didn'T.

381
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,620
Yeah,talk to me,baby girl.

382
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:54,940
Are you at the crime scene?

383
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:55,600
Yep.

384
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,950
Is there like a-- a burgundy settee against one wall?

385
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,830
Um,if a settee is a little couch.

386
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,010
Oh,my lord.

387
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,650
What? What's wrong?

388
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,700
I just got a viral video emailed to me by a friend.

389
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:10,920
A viral what?

390
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,970
It's a video that someone posted online that someone thinks is novel in some way,

391
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,860
and so they send it to everyone on their email lists,

392
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,540
and so on and so on.

393
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:20,990
This one seems to be pretty popular judging by the string of names on the forward.

394
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,830
Garcia,is there some point to all of this?

395
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,850
Yeah,I'm pretty sure it's a video of your crime scene.

396
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:27,210
More specifically of your crime,most specifically of 

397
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,080
mr. Kyle being murdered.

398
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,580
Garcia,there's a video of this murder posted on the internet?

399
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,730
Yeah.

400
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:36,890
Shot from directly across the room from the...

401
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,500
little couch.

402
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:12,820
XXXXXXXXXX Of greed.

403
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,440
Lust.

404
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,390
Disease.

405
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,460
That sounds like unsub number one.

406
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,680
He says redemption must be sought.

407
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,730
We must all repent.

408
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,020
And he referred to being raphael?

409
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,740
- It's not god.

410
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:24,740
- Or god.

411
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,960
It's someone sitting right there next to him telling this guy what to say.

412
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,200
- that's a new voice.

413
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:32,200
- As lord god spoke in leviticus

414
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,520
- a third unsub?

415
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,520
- And if you will not yet for all this

416
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,890
I will punish ye 7 times more for your sins.

417
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,070
Could just be recorded from a religious program or sermon.

418
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,040
Punish ye 7 times.

419
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,470
5 more victims.

420
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,830
These images were shot from the exact spot on the dresser where that computer sat.

421
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,930
So,if this video came from that computer's camera,then what?

422
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,830
Did the unsubs bring it with them?

423
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,440
As far as we can tell,this computer belonged to the kyles.

424
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:55,820
Garcia can do a better analysis,

425
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,050
but it has their banking statements,vacation photos.

426
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,620
One comes into the room and immediately goes after mr. Kyle.

427
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,630
What,did the other unsub turn the camera on?

428
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,520
We might be asking the wrong questions.

429
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,640
This video,this message,it's important.

430
00:21:07,690 --> 00:21:09,530
Clearly they want the world to see this.

431
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:10,840
They need it.

432
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:19,610
But they didn't bring a camera with them.

433
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,670
Agent franks?

434
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,610
Does this building hav wireless internet?

435
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,890
Yeah. Why?

436
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:27,860
That camera's on right now.

437
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,240
Did you see that,boy?

438
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,750
What's going on?

439
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:38,150
I told you,the armies of satan were gonna rise against us.

1
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,530
I told you,the armies of satan were gonna rise against us.

2
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,920
The computer's connected itself to the internet.

3
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,520
It's streaming a video feed somewhere.

4
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,460
Can we trace this stream to the destination?

5
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,910
Keep it open,garcia might be able--

6
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:59,600
<font color=orange>the armies of satan shall not prevail</font >

7
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,940
It turned off.

8
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,010
So they're controlling it remotely?

9
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,160
Is that even possible?

10
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:06,770
Yeah,you can totally access someone's computer remotely.

11
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,270
It's actually done a lot today.

12
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:11,850
When a mortal calls for tech support,instead of like giving you instructions,

13
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,480
the tech can work on your computer from wherever she is.

14
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,980
And they maintain the access even after the work is done?

15
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:17,910
They're not supposed to,

16
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,600
but I suppose you could install a trojan horse during a service.

17
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,640
Something left in the computer to be turned on later.

18
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:25,030
Same way that websites get pop-up adds onto your computer.

19
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,070
Garcia,can you check the kyles' phone records

20
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,400
and see if they called for tech support in the last 6 months?

21
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,240
Right-O.

22
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,540
Oh,and if you get me the kyles' laptop,I can search the drive for anything implanted there.

23
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,480
Fast as we can.

24
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,940
By the way,this video,

25
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,750
it's gone crazy viral.

26
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,900
What does that mean?

27
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:41,630
That means it's the most downloaded video on the entire internet,worldwide.

28
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,180
And judging by the responses embedded in the files,

29
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,860
people seem to think it's pretty cool.

30
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,700
Call us if you find anything on the kyles' computer.

31
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,120
Yeah.

32
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,400
Murder as entertainment.

33
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,470
They probably don't even realize it's real.

34
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,420
People see so many images online every day,

35
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:58,790
they might assume it's marketing for a horror film or something.

36
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,830
The unsubs are right about one thing...

37
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,850
the world is pretty screwed up.

38
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:25,110
<font color=orange>It's Not Too Late!
Raphael's Punishment Has Begun</font >

39
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,600
What?No!No!This is warning,not a show.

40
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,770
What is wrong with you people--

41
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,740
Tech support.

42
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,730
Uh,I just got this computer yesterday and

43
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,410
I can't seem to get the damn sound to work.

44
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:50,770
All right,I think I can deal with that,sir.

45
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,260
What kind of computer do you have?

46
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,370
I don't know,big?

47
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:58,950
I didn't mean the size,sir.I meant,do you have a P.C.?

48
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,830
Um,my wife gave it to me for my birthday.

49
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:06,130
Does your computer have a camera installed in it?

50
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,080
I think so.

51
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,180
But it's my sound that's messed up.

52
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:11,490
All right,I can help you with that,sir.

53
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,260
I'm gonna need you to allow me remote access to your computer.

54
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,580
Ok,sure.Whatever that means.

55
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,290
As long as it gets fixed.

56
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:23,050
No.No,no,no,no,don't!

57
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:25,870
-That whore!That jezebel!
-what

58
00:24:25,870 --> 00:24:26,960
What do you mean,no?

59
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:28,930
No,she made a mistake.

60
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:31,210
We don't have to--

61
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,790
god is about love and forgiveness.

62
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:38,110
What the hell do you know about god?

63
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:42,840
So what have we got so far?

64
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,170
Well,the killings are clinically efficient.

65
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,840
They had the ear marks of a slaughter,as in an animal.

66
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,180
Or a sacrifice.

67
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,180
Haven't been able to find anything in federal or

68
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,620
state databases that suggest similar crimes.

69
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:55,780
As far as I can tell,it's the first in a series.

70
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,100
At least one member of the team may believe he's killing in the name of god,

71
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,540
suggesng a psychopathy that should display extreme levels disorganization.

72
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,880
Yet there are forensic countermeasures

73
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,120
and somebody in control enough to do complicated computer wk.

74
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,700
One member of the team's organized,the other's extremely disorganized.

75
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,710
But what's strange is that the one that we would consider as being most in control,

76
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,080
the one that made the phone call,

77
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,930
can't seem to stop the other one from killing.

78
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:20,560
Usually the frenzied personality takes direction from the cooler head.

79
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,190
All right,so let's look at that.

80
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:24,070
Unsub one called the police before the killing,

81
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,790
but he didn't leave time for him to get there.

82
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,750
Is the phone call just a guy working on a defense in case of capture?

83
00:25:29,490 --> 00:25:30,970
I mean,maybe he didn't want to stop the other,

84
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,790
but he did whatever he had to do to cover himself.

85
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,150
So...

86
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:36,230
what do we have so far?

87
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,180
Not enough.

88
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,280
9-1-1,what's your emergency?

89
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,550
Behold,I will cast her into a bed,

90
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,480
and then I commit adultery with her to bring tribulation.

91
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:30,630
Excuse me?

92
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,660
22 smith road.

93
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:36,190
Raphael must teach more sinners the way of the lord.

94
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,590
so,franks is right,none of the open knife cases fit.

95
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,250
Tell me there's a but.

96
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,940
Well,I looked at it a different way.

97
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,140
I looked for unsolved home invasions.

98
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,180
3 months ago,there was a prowler called in directly outside of the kyles' house.

99
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:02,830
A prowler?

100
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,270
The witness was walking his dog in a nearby park.

101
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,070
Going back to his car,

102
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,700
he saw a man in dark clothing go over the back wall and start sneaking up to the house.

103
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,180
By the time the state police got there,prowler was gone.

104
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,020
Only one man?

105
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,960
Apparently.

106
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,350
Was the witness able to describe him?

107
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:17,500
If he did,it's not in this case file.

108
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,190
Is there a name and address for the witness?

109
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:20,440
Tobias hankle.

110
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,610
Lives about an hour from here.

111
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,860
It's a long shot,but he might be able to give us a description.

112
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,880
Why don't you and reid go out there,

113
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,390
see if you can find mr.Hankle and see if he remembers something.

114
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,750
On it.

115
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:31,380
-Agent hotchner.
-Yeah?

116
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,270
State just responded to another murder.

117
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,070
See if you can get the coroner out here right away.

118
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,190
Detective.

119
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,440
Yeah.Well,he called again.

120
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,400
This time it was different.

121
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,710
Only one of them spoke.

122
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,850
Which one?

123
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,150
Pretty sure it was raphael.

124
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,540
I wrote down what he said,

125
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:48,580
and I got a recording being brought out here.

126
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,970
Took almost 11 minutes to respond.

127
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,840
We only had but the one unit close.

128
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,910
Could the unsub know that?

129
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,690
Lack of police presence out here has gotten some local media attention recently.

130
00:27:57,690 --> 00:28:00,400
<font color=red>We're gonna eat our lunch over it now.不知道这句是哪来的</font >

131
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:03,280
9-1-1 call wasn't the only thing that was different.

132
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:06,690
This particular scene is weird in another way.

133
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,360
The male victim,upstairs...

134
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,190
throat cut.

135
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:12,960
Why is that weird?

136
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,110
He doesn't live here.

137
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:15,670
He's a local handyman.

138
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:16,810
Who lives here?

139
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,440
The douglases.I just talked to mr.Douglas a little while ago.

140
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,860
He's on his way back from a business meeting down state.

141
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:23,170
And according to him,

142
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,260
he wasn't having any handy work done on the house.

143
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,370
And his wife was supposed to be home.

144
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,410
But she's not?

145
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:29,810
She seems to be missing.

146
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,180
But her car is here.

147
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,790
Keys,wallet,purse.

148
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,660
I got a description out on the field.

149
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,100
-So did you copy down what the caller said?
-Yeah.

150
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:41,110
"Behold,

151
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:43,110
I will cast her into a bed,

152
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,550
and then that commit adultery."

153
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,430
Oh.

154
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,070
So adultery is the sin,

155
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:51,380
but they kill him and not her.They abduct her.

156
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,160
You think she's still alive?

157
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:55,540
Well,we never assume otherwise unless there's evidence.

158
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,940
"I will cast her into a bed."

159
00:28:58,590 --> 00:29:00,630
It's from revelation again.It's about jezebel.

160
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:05,290
She was an adulterer,whore,false prophetess.

161
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,100
She's the most reviled woman in the bible.

162
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,450
The unsubs knew she was having an affair.

163
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,750
There was a laptop here.

164
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:41,550
Don't look now,but we're on candid camera.

165
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,830
Uh-huh.

166
00:29:58,790 --> 00:29:59,720
Please!

167
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,540
Tie her hands there and there.

168
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,090
Please,don't hurt me!

169
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,580
We don't have to do this.

170
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,280
Tie her hands and shut up!

171
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,150
Insolence!

172
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,420
-I sometimes hate looking at my son!
-Please don't hurt me!

173
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,170
There's a laptop set up on the dresser upstairs.

174
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,590
With a pretty good view of the room.

175
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:19,270
Garcia's trying to trace the camera's feed back to its destination.

176
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,140
I gave her space to repent of her fornication,and she repented not.

177
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,890
No,I do!

178
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,260
I repent!

179
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,740
Please!

180
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,170
Look,she repents!

181
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,670
It's in the book,luke 15:10,"I say unto you,there is joy "

182
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,830
in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner that repenteth."

183
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,420
I'm sorry,I do!

184
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,410
I repent.Please.

185
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:43,620
Tape her mouth.

186
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,970
So let's work this out.What does the new behavior tell us?

187
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:57,110
That there was only one unsub this time?

188
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:58,960
Uh,raphael?Alone?

189
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,350
Not if he's the psychotic.He wouldn't be capable of operating this efficiently.

190
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:04,590
Someone was here who could control himself.

191
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,970
Make sure no evidence was left behind.

192
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:08,470
At the first crime,unsub one called the police,right?

193
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,190
This time it was raphael.Why?

194
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:13,290
It's like the phone call is necessary.

195
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:15,370
It's part of the signature.

196
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,230
"Power was given unto them "over the fourth part of the earth.

197
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,790
"To kill with sword,with hunger,and with death,

198
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,170
and with the beasts of the earth."

199
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,810
See anything new?

200
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:32,130
-No.
-Revelations.

201
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,250
Lot of bad stuff happens in that book.

202
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,350
Phael called alone this time?

203
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:37,750
Sounded like it.

204
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,360
This thing doesn't act like anything we've ever seen.

205
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:44,860
Someone's clearly a dominant personality and a clearly subservient one.

206
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,650
They don't swing back and forth like this.

207
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:52,340
Just don't take on each other's roles.

208
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,600
Meaning?

209
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,790
You know they can emulate the cries of over 30 different species?

210
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,630
From hummingbirds to eagles,other animals,even machinery.

211
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,560
Ever heard of the archangel raphael?

212
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,020
God preached mercy for sinners.

213
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:11,180
Don't you try to tell me about the lord,boy.

214
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,880
Now you just get yourself in front of that camera,

215
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,440
and make our message to the world.

216
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:24,750
"Jezebel,which calleth herself a prophetess,"to teach and

217
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:27,640
to seduce my servants to commit fornication.

218
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,670
" Have we ever seen this in case history?

219
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,630
A mixture of extreme psychosis in a controlled individual?No.

220
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:37,590
One of the most common indicators of extreme psychosis is solitude.

221
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,550
They don't exactly play well with others.

222
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,160
Was garcia able to find anything on a raphael in the records?

223
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:43,790
Not yet.

224
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,180
So why is he naming himself?

225
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,460
Twice?

226
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,750
Certainly not worried about us getting that name.

227
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,370
In fact,he wants us to know it.

228
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,870
An alias?

229
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,430
Or raphael doesn't actually exist.

230
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,990
So we're not looking for a team?

231
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,640
Raphael's the name of one of the archangels.

232
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,720
Meaning?

233
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,170
We may have one unsub,

234
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,550
suffering from a delusion that he's actually an archangel.

235
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,560
Maybe that first phone call was not 2 people,but one.

236
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,000
What about the third voice?

237
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,830
That I don't know about yet.

238
00:33:14,190 --> 00:33:15,800
If mrs.Douglas is jezebel,

239
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,790
there is an especially unpleasant death in her future.

240
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,540
"This is the word of the lord,

241
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,800
"that he spake by his servant,

242
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,420
"elijah,the tishbite,saying,

243
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:28,800
in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel."

244
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:53,490
Garcia's running voice analysis on the first 9-1-1 call to see

245
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:54,960
if there are actually 2 voices.

246
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,760
She's also going to peel the third voice off the videotape

247
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,450
and see if that gets anything.

248
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,600
We should have a copy of that latest call brought over here within the hour.

249
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,440
Thanks.

250
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,370
Hotchner.

251
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,840
Your tip from chronicles is on the phone.

252
00:34:08,610 --> 00:34:09,220
Garcia.

253
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,180
Jeez,don't you people answer your cell phones anymore?

254
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,320
We were driving back to atlanta through the countryside.

255
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,440
Spotty cell signal.

256
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,000
If you think that first video went viral fast,

257
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,770
the second one's going through the stratosphere.

258
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,970
Second video?

259
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:20,870
Yeah,there's a new video from our psycho.

260
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:22,270
I'm downloading it myself right now.

261
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:25,430
Some of these upload sites get more than a million hits a day.

262
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,030
-Get it on the monitor here as soon as you can.
-Right.

263
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,800
There isn't time,boy.

264
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,270
No,no,daddy,I don't want--

265
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:49,540
serving the lord ain't about what you want to do.

266
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:06,660
Serving the lord is a duty.

267
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,640
"That he spake by his servant,

268
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:17,640
"elijah the tishbite,saying,

269
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,910
in the portion of jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of jezebel.

270
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:27,090
Oh,my god.Oh,my god.Oh,my god.Oh,my god,no!

271
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,560
Jezebel's death.

272
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,270
My god.

273
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,160
You can turn it off.

274
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,850
Oh,wait.

275
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:36,930
You hadn't seen enough?

276
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:38,080
Those dogs.

277
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,940
Those 3 dogs attacked someone a couple of months ago.

278
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,350
I would have had them impounded,

279
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,540
but the victim knew the owner.

280
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:45,840
A neighbor.He didn't want to press charges.

281
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:47,040
You sure?

282
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,380
As god is my witness.

283
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,390
3 mangy mixes.

284
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,900
I knew those dogs looked sick.

285
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,580
I called animal control,

286
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,190
I don't know if they ever followed up on it.

287
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,390
Here it is.

288
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:13,340
You have the owner's name?

289
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,690
-Hankle.
-Hankle?

290
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,100
Tobias hankle.

291
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:18,880
Hi,mr.Hankle?

292
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,540
Um... yeah?

293
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,720
Mr. Hankle?

294
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,030
F.B.I.,I'm agent jareau,this is agent reid.

295
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,020
F.B.I.?

296
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,420
May we come in?

297
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:41,040
Um... I'm sorry,I don't let anyone in the house.

298
00:36:41,270 --> 00:36:44,680
Actually,I,uh,really have to,um...

299
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,210
you know,go?

300
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:48,630
You do?

301
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:49,810
For 30 minutes.

302
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,210
Why didn't you say something in the car?

303
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,890
Uh,do you mind?

304
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:53,740
I'm sorry.

305
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,090
My father doesn't like it.

306
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,620
Your father?You're,like,30.

307
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,160
At what age can one start disrespecting the wishes of their parents?

308
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:04,760
You witnessed something a few months ago,

309
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,400
that might be very helpful to us.

310
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:07,760
I did?

311
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,680
You saw someone go over a wall into a yard,you called the police?

312
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,020
Me?

313
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,920
You didn't?

314
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,120
Sorry.

315
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,760
Is there another tobias hankle here?

316
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:22,830
Just me and my father.Charles.

317
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,770
There's a report on file that lists you as calling 9-1-1.

318
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,110
You were walking a dog.

319
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,430
No,that's wrong,I don't have a dog.

320
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:30,950
Oh.

321
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,350
All right,well,sorry to bother you,sir.

322
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,960
-Are you sure I can't just quickly use the
-sorry.

323
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,760
Have a good night.

324
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,640
That's weird.

325
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:47,440
Why bother calling the police in the first place if later,

326
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,320
you're just going to pretend you didn't?

327
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:51,920
To gauge the response time.

328
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:52,800
What?

329
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,580
If you were going to kill somebody,

330
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,820
but you wanted to call the police first,

331
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:55,660
what would you need to know?

332
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,760
How long it takes them to get there.

333
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:00,210
Reid.

334
00:38:28,790 --> 00:38:30,000
J.J.!Get back here!

335
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:35,220
He's the unsub!

336
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,230
He's in the barn!Come on.

337
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,230
He's in here.

338
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,380
You sure?

339
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,740
You ever seen me pull this thing out when I wasn't?

340
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,300
Call hodges.

341
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,120
We're in the middle of nowhere,reed.

342
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,510
We have no cell service.

343
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,940
Right.Of course we have no service.

344
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,550
What do we do?

345
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,810
I don't know.He's definitely in here.

346
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,650
You cover the front,I'm gonna go around back.Hotch knows we came here.

347
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:02,400
He'll come looking for us.We'll just wait him out.

348
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,740
No,reid,are you sure we should

349
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:07,960
split up?

350
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,830
J.J.!

351
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,970
J.J.,He's out back!

Reid?

354
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,500
Reid.

355
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:54,830
Why are you running from them devils,boy?

356
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,300
They're F.B.I.

357
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,340
They're devils!

358
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,350
You're doing the lord's work.

359
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:00,940
You got nothing to be afraid of!

360
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:20,860
Reid!

361
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,200
I don't wann do this anymore!

362
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,300
Don't you disrespect me,boy.

363
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,890
I'm sorry.

364
00:40:28,090 --> 00:40:29,220
You don't got no choices

365
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,970
when the lord summons you to do his work.

366
00:40:31,970 --> 00:40:32,940
I'm sorry.

367
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,680
I'm sorry.

368
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,510
J.J.!

369
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,480
Wait,wait,wait.

370
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:21,690
I couldn't stop him by myself.

371
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,100
Ok,ok.

372
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,520
I tried to warn everyone.

373
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,100
Just relax,mr.Hankle,all right?

374
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,140
Shoot him!

375
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,620
I don't want to!

376
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:30,940
I said,

377
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,930
shoot him,you weakling.He's a satan.

378
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,620
He didn't do anything.

379
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:44,770
I won't tell you another time,boy.

380
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,000
Shoot him!
