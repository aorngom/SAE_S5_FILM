1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,300
Previously on Criminal Minds...

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,000
Please, I don't want it.
I don't want it.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,200
It helps.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,100
What is the matter with you ? 

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,400
What do you mean, what's
the matter with me ? 

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,000
I have never seen
you act like this.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,600
Really ?  Oh, in the months
that you know me,

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,700
You've never seen me act this way ? 

9
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:31,300
Hey, no offense, Emily, but...

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,500
You don't really know what
you're talking about, do you ? 

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,800
Earlier this morning katrina
crashed into the gulf coast,

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,800
With sustained winds
above 125 an hour.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,300
As many houses are being destroyed.

14
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,300
Residents are trying to evacuate.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,000
Are you listening to me, pop ? 

16
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,800
Grab your wallet and get
the hell out of there.

17
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,900
The buses are filling up.

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,600
This case is eatin' at me, Billy.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,800
Dad.

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,000
Forget the damn case.

21
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,700
What the hell am I missing here ? 

22
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:01,400
Dad, people are drowning in their homes.

23
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,700
The... Whole world's 
gonna be underwater.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,900
I got another letter, Billy.

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,300
Screw the letter. 
Forget the serial killer.

26
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,500
They're opening the superdome.

27
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,800
I want you to meet me there.

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,300
I'll be damned.

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
... Please, I'm begging you, pop.

30
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,300
Pop ? 

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,700
Behavioral analysis unit

32
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,600
We've got a serial killer
in New Orleans

33
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,300
Who killed at least
3 men pre-Katrina.

34
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,400
Until now, the New Orleans
police department

35
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,600
Believed that the serial
killer died in the storm.

36
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
What's happened to tell 
them otherwise ? 

37
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,200
A fourth body was found in
the french quarter last night.

38
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,900
Same M.O. Another male.

39
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,800
Throat slashed, eviscerated.

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,000
A year and a half ?  That's a
long cooling-Off period.

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,600
Are we sure this
is the same unsub ? 

42
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,700
He claims to be.

43
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,500
He sent a letter
to William Lamontagne,

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,200
The head detective on the case.

45
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,700
Does Lamontagne have any leads ? 

46
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,400
He died in Katrina.

47
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,300
His son is actually
leading the case now.

48
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,000
Hmm. That can't be easy.

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,600
Well, we need to pour over the evidence

50
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,600
From the first 3 murders
and determine the pattern.

51
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,100
Katrina washed everything away.

52
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,700
The 3 victims we know of,
their autopsy reports,

53
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,000
Witness statements.

54
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,100
DNA test results.

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,800
So, basically, all we have
to go on is the latest victim ? 

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Yeah.

57
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,900
Until he kills again.

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,500
Criminal minds 218

59
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,900
Robert Kennedy once said,

60
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,600
"Tragedy is a tool for
the living to gain wisdom,

61
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,800
Not a guide by which to live."

62
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,100
Hey, Reid.

63
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,100
What's goin' on up there ? 

64
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,900
From Las Vegas... Ethan.

65
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,300
I'm pretty sure he lives
in New Orleans now.

66
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,000
Really ?  Gonna give him a call ? 

67
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,600
Grew up competing against each other

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,700
In absolutely everything.

69
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,600
Spelling bees, science fairs.

70
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,300
We also both had our hearts set
on joining the bureau, but...

71
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:54,000
First day at quantico he backed out.

72
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,300
He probably just couldn't take the heat.

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,900
It's not really for us
to judge, is it ? 

74
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Right.

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,000
My bad.

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,300
These are copies of the newspaper
articles on the murders,

77
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,400
Dating back to early august 2005.

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,700
It's all we have to go on.

79
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,900
He killed 3 times,
he stopped for 18 months,

80
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,400
Then he started killing again.

81
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,700
We should have garcia run a list

82
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,500
Of any offenders in the area.

83
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,900
Anyone who spent the last year
and a half doing time.

84
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,900
Or anyone that relocated after
Katrina and recently moved back.

85
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,900
What is the victimology
in killing a mechanic,

86
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,000
A real estate broker, and a cook,

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,700
With ages ranging from 22 to 45 ? 

88
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:32,900
And this latest is
a 33-Year-Old taxi driver.

89
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,900
They just don't seem to have
very much in common.

90
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,300
Besides being male and walking
the french quarter late at night.

91
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,900
Which is notorious for muggings
off the main drag.

92
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,300
Yeah, but this guy isn't
in a rush to flee the scene.

93
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,200
A slaughter like this takes time.

94
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,800
Andrei Chikatilo fantasized that
the men he killed were his captives

95
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
And then torturing and mutilating them

96
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,800
Somehow made him a hero.

97
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,700
The city's barely back to life.

98
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,100
Something like this could
cripple its psyche.

99
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,500
So where do we start ? 

100
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,300
Well, with no case file there's
only one place we can start.

101
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,500
At square one.

102
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,100
You must be B.A.U.

103
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,000
Bill Lamontagne.

104
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,800
Hi. Jennifer Jareau.
We spoke on the phone.

105
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,100
Well, ok, then.

106
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
I pictured you different.

107
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,100
Uh, these are agents
Gideon and Morgan.

108
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,900
This is detective
William Lamontagne JR.

109
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,900
Appreciate you guys being here.

110
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,800
My daddy was too stubborn
to ever ask for any help.

111
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,300
Sorry for your loss.

112
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,000
I understand you received a letter.

113
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,100
Yeah. Before they were
lost in Katrina,

114
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,700
My daddy received 2 letters.

115
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,700
This one came addressed to him yesterday.

116
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,100
They passed it on to me.

117
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,700
You sure it's from
the same killer ? 

118
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,800
It's a detailed account
of what he did to the body.

119
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,100
4 layers of fatty tissue
sliced through like butter.

120
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,300
I only seen that 3 other times.

121
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,500
You work this case initially ? 

122
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,700
Nah. You don't forget victims like this.

123
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,400
It's like they were dissected.

124
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,300
I can still smell the alcohol on him.

125
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,300
This is New Orleans.

126
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,700
Dead or alive,
it' a smell you get used to.

127
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,600
The victim has no defense wounds.

128
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,900
Meaning this is most
likely a blitz attack.

129
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,900
No hesitation marks or rapid thrusts.

130
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,300
Cuts were methodical.

131
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,600
Almost procedural.

132
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,600
My guess... Whoever gutted
this guy was taught to.

133
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,300
So you think he might have
some medical training ? 

134
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,400
How else could he carve
around every organ

135
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,800
And leave each one intact ? 

136
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,100
Have any of his relatives
come to claim the body ? 

137
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,400
Anyone we could speak with ? 

138
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,400
No. I'll end up boxing up
the poor bastard's ashes,

139
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,500
Left to collect dust in storage.

140
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:35,000
All the bodies I've been through
in the last year and a half,

141
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,700
It's a wonder I still have room.

142
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
It'd be pretty easy to hide out
in one of these alcoves,

143
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Wait for the victim
without ever being seen.

144
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,700
Yeah, all 4 murders occurred
within a 10-Block radius

145
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,400
Here inside the french quarter.

146
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,100
On any given night, there'd
have to be thousands of people

147
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:57,000
Walking through here from the bars.

148
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,300
Tens of thousands.

149
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,700
When I first started as a cop,

150
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,900
I worked the quarter.

151
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,000
It's like being in the riot
squad every night.

152
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,200
Every sunday I'd get off
work around sunrise,

153
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,700
I'm ready to pass out,

154
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,600
My daddy'd be waiting
for me at my house.

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,936
Make me drive him uptown to Frankie
and Johnny's for poorboys.

156
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,900
Called it communing with New Orleans.

157
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,899
Did your father tell you anything else
about this case that we should know ? 

158
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,300
He tried to.

159
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,800
But you guys should
see that for yourself.

160
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,800
This wall is still standing
where daddy carved the message

161
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,200
Right before he died.

162
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,000
There's no doubt he's still
working from the grave.

163
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:42,400
"Jones." That name mean
anything to you ? 

164
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,100
No. I ran it through the database

165
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,800
Against every offender
in New Orleans.

166
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,900
And you can imagine
how many hits I got.

167
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,400
But nothing came up
in connection with this case.

168
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,200
But in your dad's final moments,

169
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,800
It was the most important
thing he wanted to say.

170
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,000
Learned how to play
the drums in this house,

171
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,000
Grew up with 2 dogs in this house.

172
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,800
All it's gonna be now is the word
"jones" carved into that wall.

173
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,000
Detective, if he had
written the unsub's name,

174
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
I think you would have
found him by now.

175
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,500
Jones is the one
piece of the puzzle

176
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,900
That your daddy did know.

177
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,900
He trusted you to figure out the rest.

178
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,200
Yeah, I know it.

179
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,000
But I've pored over
it a thousand times

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,700
And I still can't put it together.

181
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,400
I can't get it out of my head.

182
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
You ok ? 

183
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,700
Yeah.

184
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,200
I just don't want to disappoint him.

185
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,100
Is that the letter from the unsub ? 

186
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,900
Yeah.

187
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,300
I'm back with a vengeance.

188
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,500
I wanted you to know.

189
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:45,100
The last guy made it easy,
being out so late,

190
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:46,200
Stumbling home drunk.

191
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,100
I enjoyed slicing around his organs.

192
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:49,900
I thought about sending you one.

193
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,800
He was asking to be ripped,
don't you think, boss ? 

194
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,600
Yours truly."

195
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
Hey.

196
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,700
Ok.

197
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,200
To say that the victims
were asking to be killed

198
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,400
Denies all culpability.

199
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Most sexual sadists rationalize
their own behavior

200
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,700
By blaming the victims like that.

201
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,300
But there was no evidence
of sexual assault in the autopsy.

202
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,000
He could be a homosexual male

203
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,300
Stabbing because he needs
violence for arousal.

204
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,100
Every kill he's acting
out a fantasy of revenge.

205
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,400
What if he's trying to act
out something else ?  Like what ? 

206
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,300
Except for the victims were men,
it's the same M.O.

207
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
What are you talking about ? 

208
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:26,600
All 4 victims were found with
their throats slashed, eviscerated,

209
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,100
And the murders perpetrated
in semi-Public places after dark.

210
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,300
Investigators taunted with
the letters addressed to "boss."

211
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,300
The only difference is that
case was 100 years ago

212
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:35,400
And the murders took place in London.

213
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,900
Jack the ripper.

214
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,000
The unsub wants us to think

215
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,400
That he's the modern-Day version
loose in New Orleans.

216
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,900
Please.Don't

217
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,100
So the 3 of you were out
together last night ? 

218
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,800
Mark had just paid his tab at one bar

219
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,300
And he was on his way
to meet us at another.

220
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,400
You guys get in any trouble ? 

221
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,500
Drunken brawl ? 
Anyone get out of hand ? 

222
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,700
We were just out
to have fun, you know ? 

223
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,300
Minded our own business.

224
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,400
Could mark have met a girl ? 

225
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,000
Maybe upset her boyfriend ? 

226
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
No, sir.

227
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,200
He struck out like we all did.

228
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,700
Thanks, guys.

229
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,500
Ok.

230
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,400
Getting hard to keep up
with this guy.

231
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,300
Well, if he's mimicking
Jack the ripper,

232
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,900
That might be precisely the point.

233
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,100
He terrorized london for months

234
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
Without ever getting caught.

235
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,500
I'd appreciate it
if you'd gather your men.

236
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,900
We'd like to give you a profile
of who you're up against.

237
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
The offender we're looking
for is friendly,

238
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,900
Agile, somewhere between 30 and 35.

239
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,700
He'll allure with charm

240
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,400
And kill with rage.

241
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,200
We believe he's murdering men

242
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,800
To reclaim his power.

243
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,100
This unsub suffers
from low self-Esteem,

244
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,600
But he probably covers it well.

245
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,200
He dresses impeccably
to feed the facade.

246
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Jack the ripper himself

247
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,500
Was an impetuous lust murderer,

248
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,200
Whereas this offender is organized,

249
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,700
Calculating.

250
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,900
He might even stalk
his victims for days

251
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,200
Before the actual kill.

252
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
We believe this killer identifies
with Jack the ripper

253
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,300
Because he's lost his own identity.

254
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,500
Maybe through years
of child abuse...

255
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
Or some catastrophic event.

256
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,000
Because he overcompensates
to hide his insecurities,

257
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,500
We believe he may hold a position
of authority at work.

258
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,100
And since we think he's had
medical training,

259
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:39,800
Consider emts, doctors, veterinarians.

260
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,100
Please be careful.

261
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,100
For this unsub,

262
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,800
The french quarter's
a hunting ground.

263
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,900
He's certainly already proven
he knows the terrain.

264
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,500
Jeez ! 

265
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,600
Reid, you scared me.

266
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,300
Always been one step
ahead of you, man.

267
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,400
Yeah, whatever helps
you sleep at night.

268
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,700
I'm glad you called.
It's good to see you.

269
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,200
You, too.

270
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Let's get a drink.

271
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,900
Prentiss.

272
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,900
What was the thing

273
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,000
Jack the ripper took from
one of his victims ? 

274
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,200
Besides, well, you know, her life ? 

275
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,600
Oh. Uh... Uh...

276
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,700
Mmm.

277
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,600
Tick tock...

278
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,600
Tick tock.

279
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:37,500
I don't know.

280
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
A kidney.

281
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,900
How horrify ingly
fantastic is that ? 

282
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,500
Mm-Hmm. And are you
going anywhere with this ? 

283
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,800
Just that I found an unsolved murder
that happened 4 months ago

284
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,200
In Galveston, Texas,

285
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,500
With the same M.O.,

286
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,500
The victim missing

287
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,400
That very organ.

288
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,800
I amaze myself.

289
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,100
Yeah. Me, too.

290
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,000
Great work.

291
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,700
What's that ? 

292
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,200
Garcia found a similar
case in Galveston, Texas.

293
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,600
A lot of Katrina refugees
relocated there.

294
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
It could be the same guy.

295
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,800
He removed the kidney
just like Jack the ripper.

296
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Call Reid and Morgan.

297
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I want the 3 of you on a plane
to Texas tonight.

298
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,000
Ok.

299
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,600
So...

300
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,700
Are you gonna ask the question ? 

301
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,800
What question ? 

302
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Come on, man.

303
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,400
It's me here.

304
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,500
We haven't talked
to each other in years.

305
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,800
I know it's why you called me.

306
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:35,900
Ask the question.

307
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,300
Why did you quit after only
one day of fbi training ? 

308
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,300
Well...

309
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,900
I'm sure you've
considered the evidence,

310
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,000
Analyzed the signs.

311
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,100
You were battling what's
your own demons.

312
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:57,000
You didn't have time
to analyze someone else's.

313
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,400
Not bad. Not bad.

314
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,000
Those days, I did prefer
Jack Daniel's to Jeff Dahmer.

315
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,300
They both weigh on
your soul eventually.

316
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,300
Sorry

317
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,800
The bat phone.

318
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,800
Let me ask you this, Ethan.

319
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,900
Do you ever regret it ? 

320
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
You know, I may not be
changing the world, but...

321
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,600
My music makes me happy.

322
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,300
It doesn't take a profiler
to see that you're not.

323
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,200
It's not easy. And it's not...

324
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,000
I... don't think you'd believe some of
the things that I've seen.

325
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,400
John Coltrane.

326
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,400
He was a genius, too.

327
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,600
Died of cancer.

328
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,600
But most people think
it was the booze and heroin

329
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,500
That did him in.

330
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,000
What are you tryingsay ? 

331
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,600
You look like hell.

332
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,400
I'm fine.

333
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,300
Come on, man.

334
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,200
I'm a jazz musician
in New Orleans.

335
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,800
I know what it looks like
when someone's not well.

336
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,200
This may be the one time
I can tell you something

337
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:05,800
That you don't already know.

338
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,700
That might help you forget,

339
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,400
But it won't make it go away.

340
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,800
And if I can tell...

341
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,100
You're surrounded by some of
the best minds in the world,

342
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,600
And if you think they don't notice...

343
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,700
Well...

344
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,700
For a genius,

345
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,200
That's just dumb.

346
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,800
Hey. Hey.

347
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,200
Where's Reid ? 

348
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,900
I was hoping he was with you.

349
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,000
I thought you said you called him.

350
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,800
I did, 4 times. Nothing.

351
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,400
The victim's fiancee is expecting us.

352
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:48,900
What are we supposed to do ? 

353
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,500
We got one option.

354
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,000
Wheels up.

355
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:00,900
Thank you.

356
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
It's not right.

357
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
The french quarter's one of the only
parts of the city that dodged Katrina.

358
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,000
Now there's a serial killer loose.

359
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,300
It's a small area,

360
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,900
And we're narrowing down the profile.

361
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,600
We'll find him.

362
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,200
You always drink while
you're still on the clock ? 

363
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,900
This is New Orleans, honey.

364
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,600
It's a cultural thing.

365
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,300
Where are you from ? 

366
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,000
Pennsylvania.

367
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,200
I take it the folks

368
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,300
Are a little rigid about
the rules up that way.

369
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,400
Well, if it makes you feel better...

370
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,400
We'll play it
Pennsylvania style tonight.

371
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
I just hate that this guy
has a leg up on us, you know ? 

372
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,100
I promise, as soon as my team
knows anything, we'll hear.

373
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,000
Ok ? 

374
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,900
Why aren't you married ? 

375
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,900
Uh, that involves this case how ? 

376
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,000
It doesn't.

377
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,900
I'm just flirtin'.

378
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,200
It's unprofessional.

379
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,000
You don't have to answer that.

380
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,200
Excuse me.

381
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,400
Compliments of the woman
in the blue top.

382
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,400
Wow. That was... bold.

383
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,100
She might have thought
we were just working.

384
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,100
We are.

385
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,500
Are you jealous ? 

386
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,100
No. I just... I...

387
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,700
I'm surprised, that's all.

388
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,200
And you're a lousy liar, too.

389
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,500
You haven't had much practice, huh ? 

390
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,500
It's a culture thing.

391
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,200
You see.

392
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,500
There you go.

393
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,800
Everybody kept sayg

394
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,100
Crime's gonna skyrocket
after the relocation.

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You just never think
it's gonna happen to you.

396
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,200
The report said that your fiance

397
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,300
Was bar-Hopping for his bachelor party

398
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,100
On the night he was killed.

399
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
We were supposed
to be married in october.

400
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,700
He was just out
celebrating that with friends.

401
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,200
Was there anyone at Leonard's
bachelor party

402
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,100
You didn't know ? 

403
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,000
We all grew up together.

404
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,800
They're like family to me.

405
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
Whether they met
somebody out, you know,

406
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,300
That's a different story.

407
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,400
They're a rowdy bunch.

408
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,100
And they'd party with anybody.

409
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,600
Each of the last 2 victims
was traveling in a group.

410
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,600
Both were drinking, both
in public arenas, bar-Hopping.

411
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,000
So how could their friends
not see anything ? 

412
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
It like when a lion preys
upon an antelope.

413
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
You lost me.

414
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,000
That's because you,
Emily Prentiss,

415
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,400
Have never been
one of the antelope.

416
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh, scratch that.
You totally lost me.

417
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,900
Ok. Check this out.

418
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,700
The antelope travel in packs.

419
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,600
So the lion just sits and waits.

420
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,100
Waits for just one of the antelope

421
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,400
To break away from its herd.

422
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,500
So when he's alone,

423
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,900
Vulnerable, and completely unprotected,

424
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
That's when the lion strikes.

425
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,100
That's when she makes her move.

426
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,900
Wait a minute. Her move ? 

427
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,600
Prentiss, there's only one thing

428
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,500
That's gonna make a straight man

429
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,900
Leave his friends on guys night out.

430
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,600
And it'll make him leave every time.

431
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,800
One of the victims was out
for his bachelor party.

432
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,600
Another one out with just the guys.

433
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,000
What's the only temptation

434
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,500
That's gonna lure these men
away from each other ?  A woman.

435
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,900
J.J.

436
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,500
Ok.

437
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,400
Yeah, he's right here with me.

438
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,500
Thanks.

439
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:45,800
What's going on ? 

440
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,900
The ansub...

441
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,600
Hey.

442
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,900
We're not making a media
spectacle out of this.

443
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:08,900
People need to know that
this killer is a woman.

444
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,100
What ? 

445
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,900
Listen.

446
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,400
Tourists are just starting
to filter back here.

447
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
That's not the issue.

448
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,000
I can't create mass hysteria
in a city trying to rebuild.

449
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,500
Besides, we'll be playing
right into her hands.

450
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,500
So be it.

451
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,200
Look, um...

452
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,700
I'm trying not to go
above your head here.

453
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,000
Yeah.

454
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,500
I got that.

455
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,000
Then set up the press conference.

456
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,000
Hey, you guys are
back from Galveston ? 

457
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,800
First light this
morning. Where were you ? 

458
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,700
I was out with a friend.
I already told you.

459
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,500
I called you 4 times.

460
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,300
I didn't have any cell
phone reception,

461
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,600
So I didn't get your
message until late.

462
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,000
Right.

463
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,600
What's going on ? 

464
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,400
Our unsub's a woman.

465
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,200
We just found another
body in the quarter.

466
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,200
Throat's been cut.

467
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,100
He's been disemboweled, too.

468
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,600
Reeks of booze.

469
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,200
It's more than a pattern.

470
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,500
Only this time he cut
off the earlobe.

471
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,400
She's sticking with
the ripper's paradigm.

472
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,600
What do you mean ? 

473
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,500
In one letter
of correspondence,

474
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,600
Jack the ripper promised
to cut the earlobe off

475
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Of his next victim.

476
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,000
He did.

477
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,900
It was the one day
that he killed twice.

478
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,900
So she's gonna kill again
by the end of the day.

479
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,300
Ok, what do we know about
female serial killers ? 

480
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,700
Basically, you have 2 types.

481
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,000
The sante kimes model.

482
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,300
Cold, calculating.

483
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
Preys on men for money.

484
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,300
Takes her time building
relationships.

485
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,300
It's more likely
we're dealing with

486
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,800
The aileen wuornos archetype,

487
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
Motivated by paranoia and fear,

488
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,600
Luring men with sex.

489
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,200
Our unsub's organized.
She follows a routine.

490
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,000
She meets men in a bar,
flirts with them over drinks,

491
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,300
And suggests that they consummate
the evening in an alley.

492
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,200
We need to be in those streets.

493
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,800
Office just brought me this.

494
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,700
Dear boss,

495
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,500
By now I have rid the
world of one more.

496
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,100
So many men, so little time.

497
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,200
I hope you don't mind the mess.

498
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,800
They make is so easy,

499
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,500
I just can't help myself.

500
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,000
Yours truly.

501
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,300
So were looking for a woman
who will approach men,

502
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Comfortable being
the aggressor, no ? 

503
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,400
And I'm guessing she'd have
to be quite attractive

504
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,900
In order to lure them away.

505
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,900
Most of the women are out in groups,

506
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,400
So keep your eyes open
for someone on their own.

507
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,500
"So many men, so little time."

508
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,000
So she's on a quest...

509
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,000
To wipe out the race.

510
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,700
Or... the father
who molested her ? 

511
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,600
Some people think Jack
the ripper mutilated women

512
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,300
After his mother sexually
abused him for years.

513
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
For someone so enraged...

514
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,600
This unsub sounds oddly apologetic

515
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,400
For leaving a bloody crime scene.

516
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:07,600
Why ? 

517
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:11,200
That might be what
Lamontagne figured out

518
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,400
Right before he died.

519
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,400
You gotta admit, these guys
are making it pretty easy.

520
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,300
I wouldn't follow
a stranger into an alley

521
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,700
No matter how wasted I was.

522
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,800
Yeah, but you're not a man.

523
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,100
Testosterone will follow
a woman to Thailand.

524
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:24,000
Barefoot.

525
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,600
It's just a fact.

526
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,100
Did you give that newest
letter to Reid ? 

527
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
He knows that ripper case inside out.

528
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,000
He might see something I'm missing.

529
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,100
I don't think, uh...

530
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,400
What is it ? 

531
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,300
Nothing.

532
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,100
Come on.

533
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,500
You think I'm not aware
something's going on with him ? 

534
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,500
You gonna tell me why you missed
that flight to Galveston ? 

535
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,300
I already told you.

536
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,700
It was no cell reception.

537
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,000
Right.

538
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:03,600
What ? 

539
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,600
I mean, anytime
you want to come up

540
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,000
With a better answer,
I'm standing right here.

541
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,900
Dark Curls, 3 o'clock.

542
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,900
I got it.

543
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,500
She's eyeing those guys
outside that bar.

544
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,400
Let's go.

545
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,500
Oh !  Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

546
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
I hate it when that happens.

547
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,000
You all right ? 

548
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,500
What can I do to say I'm sorry ? 

549
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,700
How about a drink ? 

550
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,800
Have a drink. That's cool.

551
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,900
That's cool.

552
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,200
Sure.

553
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,900
Yeah, that's totally fine.

554
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,900
Yeah...

555
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,200
Yeah.

556
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,200
Danny.

557
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,100
You fool.

558
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,900
You dropped your wallet out there.

559
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,600
Thanks.

560
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,100
Next drink is on me.

561
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:07,600
So...

562
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,000
Where are your friends tonight ? 

563
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,000
I didn't bring any.

564
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,200
They get in the way.

565
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
Now, see, I like that.

566
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,400
'Cause, uh, most girls,

567
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,500
They won't go nowhere alone.

568
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,900
I'm not most girls.

569
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
We got nothin'.

570
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,300
Well, the day's almost over,

571
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,800
So if you're right,
we just ran out of time.

572
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Your hair's wet.

573
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,700
Oh, my god !  Aah ! 

574
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,400
She's mocking us.

575
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,800
And she's true to her word.

576
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,200
Do you have any tweezers ? 

577
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,200
Thank you.

578
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,100
What is that ? 

579
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,300
I have no idea.

580
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,800
It's a note from the unsub,

581
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,300
Addressed to your father.

582
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,100
Let's see it.

583
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,000
Dear boss,

584
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,900
He wanted it,

585
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,000
With that sharp tongue
and vulgar hand.

586
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,600
Thought you'd like to know

587
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,100
Another will soon
get what he deserves.

588
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,300
Yours truly.

589
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:49,800
It's weird. Typically, offenders
write letters to be heard.

590
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,900
Jack the ripper bragged
about not being caught.

591
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,400
This unsub isn't
using correspondence

592
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,900
To flaunt her latest kill,

593
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,900
Only to explain why she did it.

594
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,900
It's possible she considers
herself a vigilante.

595
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:03,000
That the men she's killing
deserve to die.

596
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,200
Or maybe she's contacting your father,

597
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,200
Not because he was the lead detective

598
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
On the case, but...

599
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,600
Because she believes he'd understand.

600
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:13,400
You think he knew her somehow ? 

601
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,100
Can you think of a woman
in your dad's life

602
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,000
He helped through a tough time ? 

603
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,000
Might be another police officer,

604
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
I don't know, a prostitute
he helped get off the street ? 

605
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,300
He hasn't dealt with prostitutes

606
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,300
Since he worked sex crimes.

607
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:29,700
The unsub wrote,
"he was asking to be ripped."

608
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,400
"I just couldn't help
myself," and he wanted it."

609
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,500
What if she's mirroring
the man who raped her ? 

610
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,800
Where are the files stored
from your sex crime division ? 

611
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,500
They were housed the same
place as homicide.

612
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,100
Most of them were washed away.

613
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,800
Did your dad have a partner ? 

614
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,300
Yeah. J.R. Smith.

615
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,400
Smitty, they called him.

616
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,900
He might remember something.

617
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,100
Yeah, but they had a falling out.

618
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,100
What about ? 

619
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,100
I don't know. They stopped
talking when he left sex crimes.

620
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,000
Do you have a problem calling him ? 

621
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,400
Not if it means breaking this case.

622
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,800
May I borrow your hand for a minute ? 

623
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,100
I'll be damned.

624
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,900
What is it ? 

625
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,500
The stamp on the victim's hand...

626
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,700
It's admittance into the mon cherie.

627
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,100
It's a bar in the french quarter.

628
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,900
Oh, yeah ? 

629
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,700
Yeah.

630
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,800
9 years ago it was called Jones.

631
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,500
Bingo.

632
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,600
Get Garcia on the horn.

633
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,500
O captain, my captain.

634
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,500
I need you.

635
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,900
Anything. Talk to me.

636
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,400
Is there any newspaper reports

637
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,900
About a rape at a bar called Jones ? 

638
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,700
Zilch.

639
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,000
You sure ?  It would have beenav

640
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
About 9 years ago.

641
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,600
Nada.

642
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,600
Ok. Uh...

643
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,900
Cross-Reference William Lamontagne

644
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,200
With Jones bar.

645
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,400
Bull's-Eye.

646
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,500
Police blotter...
Answered a disturbance

647
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,100
At Jones bar in the french quarter,

648
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,700
February 19, 1998.

649
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,400
Looks like it was during mardi gras.

650
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,200
You are the best ever.

651
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,600
Ohh... and you're the
most perceptive.

652
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
Smitty.

653
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:22,700
How are you ? 

654
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,400
I hope you got a good reason

655
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,900
Dredging this crap up.

656
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,100
Well, I was hoping

657
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,900
You might remember
being called here

658
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,300
With my daddy 9 years ago.

659
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:34,700
Is that a joke ? 

660
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,100
No.

661
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,500
My name's Jason Gideon.

662
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
We're from the FBI.

663
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,300
We're investigating
the series of murders

664
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,200
In the french quarter.

665
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,000
What's that got to do with me ? 

666
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,700
We need you to tell us
what happened

667
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,600
The night you and detective
Lamontagne answered the call

668
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,400
In this bar.

669
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,800
Am I missing something ? 

670
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,600
You really don't know, do you ? 

671
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,600
After that night, your daddy

672
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,200
Tried to bring me up on sanctions.

673
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,200
Why ? 

674
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,100
It was mardi gras.

675
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,700
Some girl claimed she was raped.

676
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,600
In this bar.

677
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,500
I wasn't buying it.

678
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,100
What did she say happened to her ? 

679
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,500
Brass backed me up.

680
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,800
They ended up transferring
your daddy out

681
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,700
To shut him up.

682
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,600
What happened here ? 

683
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,900
It almost cost me my career.

684
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,200
Do you mind telling us what happened ? 

685
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,500
My best recollection,

686
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,200
She said she was sitting at the bar

687
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,400
With 2 friends.

688
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,300
One of the boys asked her
if she wanted to play some pool.

689
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,800
Witnesses claim she was up
for anything.

690
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,000
She followed him up here ? 

691
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,800
His friend not far behind.

692
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,000
She knew he was there.

693
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,500
That girl was a tease.

694
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,500
She was looking for a good time.

695
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,900
Anyway, a couple of guys
were going along with that.

696
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,400
Did she yell for help ? 

697
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
She said she did.

698
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,700
But not a single person
claimed that they heard her.

699
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,500
That's what you registered
as a disturbance ? 

700
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,500
It was mardi gras.

701
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,900
Listen to me.

702
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,100
That girl had enough beads
hanging from her neck

703
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:29,000
To jewel a small city.

704
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,400
Anyone exposes themselves
that much in one day

705
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,100
Is not a credible witness in my book.

706
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,000
But she wanted to press charges.

707
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,800
I told her it was a waste of time.

708
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,600
I knew one of the accused.

709
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,800
He was a good kid.

710
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,500
He didn't need the stink
of that accusation.

711
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,900
So you protected a rapist ? 

712
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,100
Well, that right there

713
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:51,700
Was a bone of contention
between his daddy and i.

714
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
As far as I was concerned,

715
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
No such rape ever took place.

716
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:55,900
Are you gonna tell me

717
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,000
Why you went and dragged
this dirt back through my life ? 

718
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,200
You know the serial killer

719
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,300
Who's cutting up men
in the french quarter ? 

720
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,000
She was your victim.

721
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,000
We're trying to find a name.

722
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,300
You don't even remember her name ? 

723
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,700
It was 9 years ago.

724
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,100
What about the name of the
"good kid" who raped her ? 

725
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,600
Smitty...

726
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,700
You tell me right now or I'll file
a new sanction against you,

727
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,400
And I guarantee you,
this time it'll stick.

728
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,900
Mr. Tibideaux, we need you
to answer a few questions

729
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,600
About a disturbance you were
involved with in 1998.

730
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,700
I don't know what you're talking about.

731
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,500
At a bar called Jones.

732
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,500
It was mardi gras.

733
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,700
Well, then,
I must have been drinking some,

734
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,600
'Cause I don't remember a thing.

735
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,100
We just need to know the name...

736
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,200
Look, I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

737
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
The statute of limitations is up.

738
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,300
We just need a name.

739
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,800
Someone accuses me of rape,
­

740
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,200
I'm going to remember her name.

741
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,900
What can I tell you, cher ? 

742
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,900
I guess she didn't make
that good of an impression.

743
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:17,300
Unlike yourself, right now.

744
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,800
You know, I'm guessing if someone

745
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,100
Did do something
to that girl that night,

746
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,400
Then she was probably asking for it.

747
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,800
Maybe even liked it.

748
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,000
Guy's not giving up anything.

749
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,400
Right after the double murder,

750
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,800
What was the ripper's next move ? 

751
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,700
He mutilated and
dismembered Mary Kelly

752
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,200
In her one-Room flat until
she was unrecognizable.

753
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
It's believed to be his most
vicious kill of all.

754
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,700
'Cause he had privacy.

755
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,200
And time to torture his victim
before killing her.

756
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,200
Maybe we're not too late.

757
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,800
She murdered these men,

758
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,600
And I'm guessing it's only
a matter of time

759
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,300
Before she works
her way back to the one

760
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,900
She really wants to kill.

761
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,500
She make an impression now ? 

762
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,700
Work me.

763
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:14,500
We have a name... Sarah Danlin.
I need an address.

764
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,200
1141 Sherman Avenue.

765
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,700
It looks like she was
a med student at tulane,

766
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,900
But she dropped out.

767
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,300
Let me guess... February 1998.

768
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,300
Yeah. Thanks.

769
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,900
We got her.

770
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,500
I'm John, by the way.

771
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,600
John.

772
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,900
Take off your clothes.

773
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,500
Sarah Danlin, F.B.I. ! 
Open the door.

774
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,900
The things I'm gonna do to you.

775
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,300
Me first.

776
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,900
F.B.I. ! 

777
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,600
Clear. Clear.

778
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,900
She's not here.

779
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,100
Guys, there are some ripperologists

780
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,300
Who speculate that Mary Kelly

781
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,800
Was actually killed in a flat

782
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
That Jack the ripper
rented for the night.

783
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,200
I'm going to have Garcia
check Sarah Danlin's

784
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,000
Credit card accounts.
It's a long shot,

785
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,100
But maybe we can trace her room
back to her charge cards.

786
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,100
Aah ! 

787
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,300
What the hell was that ? 

788
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:13,700
Shh.

789
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,800
You're crazy.

790
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:20,100
You never did explain those
"things" you could do to me.

791
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,500
Souvenirs.

792
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,300
These are from bars
in the french quarter.

793
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,700
This is from mon cherie.

794
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,700
She's trolling for victims
in the place where it all began.

795
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,100
She can't move on.

796
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,200
The rape isn't the whole story.

797
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,000
I'll bet there's a history
of sexual abuse

798
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,400
That contributes to her rage as well.

799
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,500
It's almost like by taking
on the ripper persona,

800
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,100
She was trying to kill
something within herself.

801
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,800
Yeah, mama, what do you got ? 

802
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,300
Sarah Danlin's visa was charged

803
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:46,900
An hour ago at the Royal Ruby Inn.

804
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:49,100
Ah, baby girl, you never
disappoint. Thank you.

805
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,800
Royal Ruby Inn.

806
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,200
That's 2 blocks from here.

807
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,300
Let's go

808
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,300
Please ! 

809
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,000
Please. Please.

810
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,600
I have... I have children.

811
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,900
Stop...
Please.

812
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,500
You asked...

813
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
FBI ! 

814
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,900
Drop the knife. Drop the weapon.

815
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,400
He wanted it... and he got it.

816
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,600
Put it down now.

817
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,400
We need an emt tech right away.

818
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,400
What are you waiting for ? 

819
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,100
Ma'am, we don't want to shoot you.

820
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:27,200
Be such a shame to waste this.

821
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,500
Do you want it, too ? 

822
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,800
What I want is for you
to put that knife down.

823
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,500
Come on.

824
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,000
Don't fight it.

825
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,600
Sarah, we don't want to hurt you.

826
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,900
Men.

827
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,600
Sarah, my name's
William Lamontagne JR.

828
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,200
You knew my daddy ? 

829
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,200
Yeah, yeah.

830
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,100
You trusted him. So trust me.

831
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,100
Where is he ? 

832
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,500
The storm took him.

833
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,600
Come on. It's over.

834
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,000
It's over.

835
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,800
Hey.

836
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,700
Hey there.

837
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,900
The medic says that her
victim's going to be ok.

838
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,000
I heard what you did in there.

839
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,600
Your dad would be really proud.

840
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,200
It's weird.

841
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:00,400
I spent all this time focused
on closing this case for him...

842
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,100
And now it's over.

843
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,800
Yeah.

844
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,900
I thought I'd feel happy,
but I just feel lost.

845
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,100
Because you've...

846
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,900
And now you're leaving ? 

847
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,600
How will I survive a woman
like you going so far away ? 

848
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,300
Well, despite what
you may have heard...

849
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,100
Cell phones can be very
good for your health.

850
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,400
See ya.

851
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,000
How'd you find me ? 

852
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,300
You're not all that hard to profile.

853
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,200
Your friend is good.

854
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,800
I missed that plane on purpose.

855
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:22,900
I know.

856
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,100
I'm struggling.

857
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,900
Well... anybody who's been through

858
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,800
What you've been through recently...

859
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,800
Would.

860
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,500
This is all I was groomed for.

861
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,400
I never even...

862
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,600
I never even considered
another option.

863
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:42,100
Now you're questioning
whether or not

864
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:43,800
You're strong enough to be here ? 

865
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,100
Yeah.

866
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,000
I have been playing at this job

867
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,100
In one way or another
for almost 30 years.

868
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,900
I've felt lost.

869
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:58,800
I've felt great.

870
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,500
I have felt scared,

871
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,500
Sick,

872
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,400
And insane.

873
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,500
I don't know.

874
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,300
I guess the day this job stops
gnawing at your soul and...

875
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:25,500
Hands... your hands stop feeling cold...

876
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,600
Maybe that's the time to leave.

877
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,700
I guess I just needed
to try to figure out

878
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:38,900
If I could step away from this job.

879
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,000
And ? 

880
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,800
I'll never miss another plane again.
