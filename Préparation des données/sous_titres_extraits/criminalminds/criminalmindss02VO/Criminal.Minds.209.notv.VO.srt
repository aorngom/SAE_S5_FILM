00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:05,000
ST.LOUIS,MISSOURI

2
00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,680
Ok.

3
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,140
Oh!

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,450
It is notjust me,right?

5
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,430
- Our girl'sgot an arm.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,520
Oh.
Just like her dad.

7
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:19,760
Look at her.
We blinkedand 4 years went by.

8
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,010
So,what do you think?
Should we do this again?

9
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:23,880
Sounds like a plan.

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:26,500
Uh-oh.
Who's coming?Aah!

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,460
Ah.So,what doyou think,katie?

12
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:33,550
You want a littlebrother or sister?
Yeah?Well...

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:36,050
the boss has spoken.

14
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,620
Ok.Well,you go get her,
and I'll go get lunch.

15
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,840
Ok.

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,030
My daughter molly.
She's 6.

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,460
She's got braids,yellow sweatshirt.

18
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,400
- What am I gonna do?
- Ok,ok.Calm down.

19
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,300
Braids,yellow sweatshirt.

20
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:05,630
We were playing hideand seek up here.
She must have gotten lost in the trees.

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,300
Oh,god.
I'm so stupid.

22
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,480
Tom!
Tom!

23
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,490
Shh,shh,shh!
Wait.

24
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:14,110
Did you hear that?
It came from over here.

25
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,230
Molly?
Honey?!

26
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,240
Daddy's here.

27
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,250
Molly.

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,510
No.

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:33,520
Did you find molly?
Is she ok?

30
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,930
Mommy,wake up.
It's past 10:00.

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,600
Ah!Damn it.
Why did you let me sleep?

32
00:01:57,650 --> 00:02:00,090
Why don't you getan alarm clock?

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,510
- Did you eat?
- Pizza.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,460
- And the baby?
- Pizza.And milk.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,220
Get some sleep,jay.

36
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,060
Hey,I'll bring yousome pancakes.

37
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,160
Yeah.
When?

38
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,040
Hi.
Want company?

39
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,970
Hi.

40
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,970
F.B.I. Headquarters
QUANTICO,VIRGINIA

41
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,500
Come in.

42
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,090
- Hi.
- Hi.

43
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,880
- Agent hotchner?
- Yes.

44
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,880
I'm agentemily prentiss.

45
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,580
How do you do?
Oh,you're ambassadorprentiss' daughter.

46
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,010
I did security clearances
for your mother's staff.

47
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,970
It was oneof my first commands.

48
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,970
I believe you were off
to brown at the time.

49
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,960
- Actually,it was yale.
- Ah.

50
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,380
I've been in the bureau almost 10 years now.

51
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:37,130
Don't tell me that.
Has it been that long?

52
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,190
Apparently,sir.But I work mostly
in the midwest.St.Louis,chicago.

53
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,690
Good.

54
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,300
- Your parents well?
- Yeah,yeah,they're great.

55
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,680
Excellent.

56
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,540
What can I do for you?

57
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,490
Uh,well,I guessI was hoping
you could tell mewhere to put my stuff.

58
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,550
I'm sorry?

59
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,890
I'm supposed to starthere today...
at the bau.

60
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,670
There's been a mistake.

61
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:07,870
- I don't think so,sir.
- There's definitelybeen a mistake.

62
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,170
Excuse me.
We'regetting started.

63
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,340
Thank you.
I'll be right there.

64
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,930
I didn't approve
this transfer,agent prentiss.

65
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,490
I'm sorry for the confusion,
but you've been misinformed.

66
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,440
But--excuse me.
It's very goodto see you again.

67
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,300
did you approveany transfer?

68
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,320
No.
I would'vediscussed it.

69
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,580
That's what I thought.
She's got the paperworkto join the team.

70
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:38,530
- You want meto make a call?
- No.I'll make it.

71
00:04:43,190 --> 00:04:45,370
St.Louis is in trouble.

72
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,660
They've got 2 serial killers.

73
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:52,450
This killer abducts his victims
from public places,dumps them in the woods.

74
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:55,530
They consulted us months ago
after the third murder.

75
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,060
Well,now it might beup to 6.

76
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,490
Ellen carroll's been missing
since yesterday.

77
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:05,690
The first 2 victimswere found near
mill creekin mark twainnational forest.

78
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,420
No wonder it takes daysto find the bodies.

79
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:11,780
The forestis 1.5 million acres
and 78,000of that is wilderness.

80
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,290
What's the storywith these women?

81
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,030
8 victims. All prostitutes.
Latest is marci mitchell.

82
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,210
She was killed last night
with a .44 magnum.

83
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,750
All are tiedto a serial shooter
claiming responsibility.

84
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,350
He's contactedjim meyers,
a reporterat the missouri herald.

85
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,990
So he's not getting
the attention he thinkshe deserves.

86
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,830
He signs itthe hollow man,
names himself for the press.

87
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,850
Why hollow man?
What,he feel emptyinside or something?

88
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,640
He uses hollow pointbullets.

89
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,230
No one even knewthis guy existed
until he sentthis letter.

90
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,570
Well,he's killedmore victims,
but lookwho he's chosen.

91
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:47,180
Hundreds of victimsgo unnoticed because
they'resocial outcastsand never makethe front page.

92
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,260
When mill creek kills,the hollow man
shoots another prostitute.

93
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,470
So one doesn't want to be
outdone by the other.

94
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,370
Sounds likesibling rivalry to me.

95
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,650
They've been killing
independently of eachother for a year now.

96
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,800
Each kill they'relearning something...

97
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:02,280
from the other.

98
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,240

Elbert hubbert once wrote,"if men could only know each other,they would neitheridolize nor hate."

103
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,950
Thank you.

104
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:00,180
What's wrong?

105
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,740
Did you know there areroughly 30 serial killers
at large in the U.S.At any given time?

106
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:07,470
It's an incredibly rare occurrence
to have themoperating in the same city.

107
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,540
- How many timeshas that happened?
- To my knowledge,3 times.

108
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,300
There was a guy killing
at the same time as the son of sam.

109
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:16,490
And then againin new orleans,
and most recentlywith the phoenix murders.

110
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:18,270
Serial shootersare typically loners.

111
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,860
This guy likesto kill at night.

112
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,080
His victimsare prostitutes,so he may lack confidence
with womenor have poorsocial skills.

113
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,660
No rape.
The guycould be impotent.

114
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,300
He's a wannabetough guy.

115
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,460
It's not hard to be  tough holding a .44.

116
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:33,440
The gun gives him power and
lets him maintaindistance from the kill.

117
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:35,780
This guy doesn'twant to touch
the bodieswith his hands.

118
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,100
Mill creek killer.

119
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:43,110
Hunts during the day, targets
educated,middle-class women.

120
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,270
He'd have to lookand act like they do.

121
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,070
The women die from blunt force head traumas.

122
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:52,770
This guy wantsto be close,
he wants to feel the lifeleave their bodies.

123
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,720
These guysare polar opposites.

124
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,230
Just like their victims.They live in
the samecity but they'reworlds apart.

125
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,510
I'm gonna see ifthe shooter's victims
have any familiesI can talk to.

126
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,940
That's a good idea.I'm already familiar
with the mill creek case.

127
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,160
Reid,can you takea look at the letter
for handwriting analysisand psycho linguistics?

128
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:10,410
- Of course.
- Looks like I'm with you.

129
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,400
I'll go aheadand talk with
ellencarroll's husband.

130
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,920
I'm meeting jim meyers,
the reporterfrom the missouri herald.

131
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,900
Well,tell him not to write about the hollow man.

132
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:22,740
If we want to drawthe shooter out,
best way to do that isto act like he doesn't exist.

133
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,220
I'd feel much betterwhen you find ellen.

134
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,240
Mr. Carroll,believe me,we are trying.

135
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:37,870
You know,when you have kids,you become so fixated
on where they areand what they're doing,

136
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,710
you don't thinkyou need  to worryabout your spouse.

137
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:44,070
I understandyour wife is
a partnerat a law firm.

138
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,240
Now aside from work,taking care of the family,
does she make timefor herself?

139
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,460
She's an avid runner,participates in the
st.Louis marathonevery year.

140
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:55,090
Is she shy,nervous about meeting new people?

141
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,520
Ever since we had katie, I'd say
she'smuch more trusting.

142
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,840
You don't rememberher talking to anyone
you don't knowat that playground?

143
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,230
No.
No one.

144
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,730
How did I not seesomeone take my wife?

145
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:11,310
Mr. Carroll,the man who did this,
somehow he justfits right in.

146
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,380
He doesn't look or sound like
he doesn't belong.

147
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,050
Oh,hey,little lady.

148
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,550
Hey.

149
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:30,110
She keeps asking me, when her
mommy'scoming home.

150
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,380
I don't knowwhat to saY.

151
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,660
I missed you.

152
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,460
You are so beautiful.

153
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:07,510
Agents hotchnerand reid,fbi.

154
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:10,680
- What do you want?
- We'd like to talk to you.

155
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,280
Hold thatbadge up again.

156
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,930
We're here to talk to you
about marcie mitchell.

157
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,270
- I'm her mother.
- I'm sorryfor your loss,ma'am.

158
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,500
What's this?

159
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,940
They're for me.
Take your brother inside.

160
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,280
- Is this about mom?
- I said inside.

161
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,470
You gonna judge meor ask questions?

162
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,510
Is there anyone who can
help youwith the kids?

163
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,250
Is that whatyou came here for?

164
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:58,640
Ma'am,we'vejust been assigned your daughter's case.

165
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,420
We're in the processof gathering information,
but so far no witnesseshave come forward.

166
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:06,430
Well,around here guns go off
like those damn car alarms--every 15 minutes.

167
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,720
Nobody'sstupid enough to talk, nobody cares.

168
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,440
We do.

169
00:12:10,450 --> 00:12:13,470
You wouldn't even behere if
it wasn't for them.

170
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:19,380
"Heinous crimes against
upstanding membersof the community."

171
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,260
Nobody writes about
prostitutes being shot

172
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,480
because they won'tadmit they think
they'recleaning up the place.

173
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,990
You're right.

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,950
Caseslike your daughter's
usually go unsolved.

175
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,490
The problem is peoplearen't looking for them
because they don't knowthat they're missing.

176
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:35,690
Part of her job was to
stay below the radar.

177
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,170
Doesn't mean she wasany less important.

178
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:43,240
She made bad choices.

179
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,710
But she was a good person.

180
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,250
She loved those boys.

181
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:52,870
Whoever shot her should
pay for what they did.

182
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,460
So don't come in here
and say you're sorry.

183
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,630
Just dosomething about it.

184
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,390
We will,Ma'am.

185
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:04,620
Hi.
You must beagent sheridan?

186
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,850
- Agent jareau.
- Hi.

187
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,000
- Really appreciateyou coming so quickly.
- Yeah.

188
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,240
Why don't youset up in here?

189
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,760
Oh,wow.You've gotlots of evidence
for the mill creekkiller case.

190
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,050
- What aboutthe hollow man?
- Right here.

191
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,560
There's beenat least 8 women shot.
This is all we've got?

192
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,410
You know thesecases
don't generate much evidence.

193
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:30,180
All we have at the scene are
a couple of bulletsand no one's talking.

194
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,310
Well,hopefully,we can change that.

195
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,900
Agent jareau,there's
a reporter here to see you.

196
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,800
- Thank you.Excuse me.
- Sure.

197
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,310
Jim meyers.Hi.Agent jareau.
We spoke on the phone.

198
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:43,690
Hi.
Thanks for stopping by.

199
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,170
Sure.
Here's thatletter I faxed to you.

200
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,400
Oh,great.

201
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,810
So,did the hollow manshoot those prostitutes
because I wrote aboutthe mill creek victims?

202
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:54,050
He would've killedthem anyway.

203
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,410
But right now he'slooking for recognition.
That's whyhe's contacted you.

204
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,710
But I'm not in any danger.

205
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,590
I mean,I don't wantto be
staring downthe barrel of a gun.

206
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,160
Right now he needs you.You're his
only hope toget on that front page.

207
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,960
You know,I had no ideaI could get on
a serial killer's radarby writing aboutanother one.

208
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,350
We're going to ask thatyou not print anything relatingto the hollow man orthe women he's killed.

209
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,660
Don't those victimsdeserve just
as much inkas those other women?

210
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,100
Of course they do.

211
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,950
But we needthe shooter
to keep communicatingwith you.

212
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:25,070
And if you satisfyhis need for attention,
he could disappear,and I'm sorry.

213
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,140
We just can't takethat chance.

214
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:29,420
Excuse me,agent jareau?

215
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:36,110
We just found ellencarroll's body.

216
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,870
Agents gideon,morgan,this is agent sheridan.

217
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,430
- How are you?
- Forgive me.

218
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:48,390
How faris the abduction
itefrom these woods?

219
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,850
About 40 miles or so.

220
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,730
He tried to hide itpretty well.
He covers the bodyvery carefully.

221
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,910
Must feel remorsefor killing them.

222
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,940
This lipstick's beenapplied recently.
It's still moist.

223
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,980
Look at her hair.
It's been brushed,put behind her ears.

224
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,620
She was abducted,what,an hour from here?
Draggedthrough these woods?

225
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,260
Her hair would notlook like that.

226
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:12,630
So he keeps her safefrom the elements
and then comes backfor the body.

227
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,170
That's why he chooses a
secondary locationthat's so remote.

228
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,900
- This isn'tabout remorse.
- No.

229
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,580
- He wantsto be alone with her.
- Needs his privacy.

230
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:22,450
You never noticed
the hair or the makeupbefore?

231
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:24,690
No.
Maybe it wasthe timing.

232
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:29,530
She was foundwithin 24 hours,and the others
had alreadysuccumbed to the elements.

233
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:31,770
Sex actswith dead bodies are rare occurrences.

234
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,530
However,bundy did it regularly.

235
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,890
So how is thisgoing to help usto catch him?

236
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,780
Now we knowhe has a ritual.
He needs to defilethe bodies.

237
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,890
Next timewe'll be herewaiting for him.

238
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:47,510
Sixth Victim Falls to Mill Creek Killer

239
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:14,480
We're off-duty just like you.

240
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,840
2 victims at once.
That's a first for him.

241
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:48,170
You think he wentout looking to kill more
than one woman,or is it just happenstance?

242
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:49,960
He chose a differenthunting ground.

243
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,750
Yes,we're in an alley,but we're behind
an expensive hotelin a nice neighborhood.

244
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:57,220
You get a differentclass of prostitute,
ones that don't walkthe street alone.

245
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,650
He was lookingfor a challenge.

246
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,780
Question is,what gavehim the confidence
to stray outof his comfort zone?

247
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,280
Make sure to runthat for prints.

248
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,430
He displayed the newspaperbetween them.

249
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,860
He took the time when he
could've just tossed it aside.

250
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,660
It's deliberatE.
He wants us to knowhe's angry.

251
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,350
Angry enoughto change his M.O.

252
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,640
I heard there was a double
homicide this morning.

253
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,890
Was it hollow man?

254
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,430
- Agents are confirmingthat now.
- I've written about him.

255
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,460
There's no guaranteethat he would've stopped
killingif you would've giveninto his demands.

256
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,980
In fact,media attention
could've fueled himto kill more.

257
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,130
We don't knowthat for sure.

258
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,850
This is all justa guessing game,isn't it?

259
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,950
No.
It's behavioralanalysis.

260
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:37,590
We're dealingwith an offenderwho believes
that murdering peopleis a good wayto become famous.

261
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,490
All I know is thatyou told me to
ignore himand he takes 2 lives.

262
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,260
If I dismissthis double homicide,
what happens tomorrow?

263
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,450
We won't knowuntil then.

264
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:54,120
Too bad we couldn'ttrace
any printsfrom the newspaper.

265
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:55,660
What have you got?

266
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,850
he only sent thisto an individual,

267
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,060
which shows he'snot confident enough
to initiate contactwith the masses.

268
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,970
Emotional indicators are analyzed through slants.

269
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:09,300
The shootermaintains vertical,
narrow-lettered writing,both signs of repression.

270
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,290
And the pressure,if you look closely, is excessively heavy,

271
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,770
which showsthat he's uptight and caneasily overreact.

272
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:18,170
You got all thatfrom his handwriting?

273
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,650
Graphology is an effectiveand reliable
indicatorof personality and behavior.

274
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,880
My writing'salways different.

275
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,930
That's because itexpresses
your emotionsat that given time,

276
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:28,540
just likeyour facial expressionsparallel
the wayyou're feeling whileyou're speaking.

277
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,390
I'm surprised this guywrites in cursive.

278
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:33,710
His message is so clear.
I would've thoughthe'd print everything.

279
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:38,250
Actually,his connectedwriting shows that he deals
with problemsin a practicaland direct manner.

280
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,020
- Like shooting someone.
- Exactly.

281
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,170
The hollow manuses simple statements, all first person.

282
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,140
For example,"I won't be ignored."

283
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,080
He's obviously tiredof feeling this way.

284
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,940
It's quite possible he'sgot a job in solitude
or one that he feelsstrips him of his identity.

285
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,790
His job might require himto wear a uniform,
something that showsabsolutely no individuality.

286
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,050
Or he may be overqualified for his menial job

287
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,940
and feels that he doesn't get
the respectthat he necessarilydeserves.

288
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:07,020
But todayhe's killed 2 women,
which tells ushe's growing confident.

289
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,230
This makes himunpredictable and dangerous.

290
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:12,090
And because he hasno physical
contactwith his victims,

291
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,930
it's going to make himthat
much harder to catch.

292
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,730
We have more informationon the mill creek killer

293
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,210
because he spendsa lot of timewith
his victimsbefore and afterhis kills.

294
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:25,550
Because his victimswillingly follow him
in broad daylight,he appears harmless.

295
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,360
- He's mostlikely handsome.
- Handsome?

296
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:31,070
Yes.These women wouldn't follow
an unattractive man.They just wouldn'T.

297
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:33,660
He's handsome,and he's got
the socialskills to trick his victims.

298
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:36,890
Those who know him well,they'd be shocked
to learn that he'sthe man that we're after.

299
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,330
He's been ableto get his victims
awayfrom family,friends.

300
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,250
Obviously,this makeshim feel powerful.

301
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:46,190
If this guy is so smart,why would he risk driving
his victimsfrom the abduction siteto the woods?

302
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:48,180
Because of the ritual.

303
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,440
It's become the mostimportant thing to him.

304
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,160
Dominates his thoughts.
Bullets providethe privacy he needs.

305
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,660
The hollow manis motivated
byexternal pressures.

306
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,380
This is a guy who simplywants attention.

307
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,970
The mill creek killer,on the other hand,
he's drivenby internal forces.

308
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,700
He's a sexuallymotivated offender.

309
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,130
Now,this makes hima lot more predictable

310
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:09,670
but don't think for a second
it makes himany easier to catch.

311
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:25,000
Where are you?

312
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,780
Excuse mE.

313
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
Meredith dale.
25.

314
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,490
She was supposedto meet her friend
for a bike ridebut disappeared.

315
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,040
- Disappeared when?
- An hour ago.

316
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:41,280
- How can we be sureit's him?
- Well,look at her.

317
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,780
She's his type physically,
she vanishes into thin air.

318
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,870
It's got the mill creek'sM.O.All over it.

319
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,590
I'll set up road blocks in and out of the forest.

320
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:52,370
Well,based onthe other timelines,
we have to assume he's hidingher body right now.

321
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:56,380
Best chanceof catching himis find
meredith dale's bodyand sit tight.

322
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:58,710
We know he'll be back.

323
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:08,750
I'm going to need you to step out of your vehicle.

324
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,790
- What's going onhere,officer?
- Just routine check.

325
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:15,820
- Can you open your back?
- Uh,yeah,sure.

326
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,270
Many people come throughhere today?

327
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,950
- What are youdoing up here?
- Went for a hike.

328
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,490
No water,no supplies?

329
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:39,200
My bootsare all I need.

330
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,360
That it?

331
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,460
- That's it.
- Ok.

332
00:21:44,490 --> 00:21:47,820
What if these dumpsitesaren't random?

333
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,880
The bodies werescattered all over.

334
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,180
Look at this.
There's no pattern.

335
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,510
No,I see that,but we're talking
about a lotof area to cover here.

336
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,310
He had to havesome kind of
plan going into these woods.

337
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,790
Must have done his homework.

338
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,470
Ok.The first bodywas found
deep into the woods.

339
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,710
That's a 3-hour carride from the city.

340
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:07,470
The first time,he's more
carefulin disposing of her.

341
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:11,900
Her body was discovered by a
forest ranger5 daysafter the abduction.

342
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:17,080
And all the other victims--look at this¡ª
they followthe same pattern.

343
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,930
What are you saying?
You think he worksup there?

344
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,980
He might.

345
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,720
All I doknow for sureis that he has
to be familiar enoughwith these woods

346
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,340
to know when a rangeris on duty.

347
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,710
He knew preciselywhen and where
to drop the bodies.

348
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,830
Now that is an awesome
place to dump a person.

349
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:34,120
- Come on,garcia.
- What?I'm justsaying,angel fish.

350
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,670
A million acresconverts into
over 2,300square miles to cover.

351
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,230
Evil knewwhat he was doing.

352
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,040
Yeah?Well,now so do we.

353
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,600
Talk to me.
How's the rangerschedule break down?

354
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,060
Ok.The national forestis divided
into 6 ranger districts,

355
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,860
which are patrolledevery 3 to 5 days.

356
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:53,750
Now,the potosi-fredricktown area
must be where he'sheaded to next

357
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:55,750
because the rangers werejust there yesterday,

358
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,200
which means they're notscheduled
to revisit itfor at leastanother 3 days.

359
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:03,870
And look at that,
it's the district closest to the city.

360
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:06,090
Well,that makes sense.
He's in a hurry.

361
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:08,310
He wantsto get in and out of there
without a lot of trouble.

362
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,310
Which area has the easiest
access to the main road?

363
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:13,300
That would be...
saltgrass cove.

364
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,950
Saltgrass cove.

365
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,310
Yep.He'd have plentyof time to revisit her.

366
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:23,050
What?No,no.I don't want to know that.Bye-bye.

367
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:26,490
Think I know where he took meredith dale.

368
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,230
Brownie,come here.

369
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,580
Damn it.

370
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,010
Please,please.

371
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:54,900
Everything needsto look
the sameas when he left it.

372
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,960
- He'll come back.
- He needs to seemeredith again.

373
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,240
This bastard has killed
7 women on my watch.

374
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,980
- Comb the scene!
- Oh,no.Please,please!Stop!

375
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,600
Let's clearthe immediate area.

376
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,630
Post yourselvesalong the perimeter.
It's imperativethat you become invisible.

377
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,940
He set his own trap.

378
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:21,550
What we need to do now
is stake out in the woodsand hunt him,

379
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:24,460
just like he doeshis victims.

380
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:37,070
That's got to be him.

381
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,140
Fbi!Stay down!
Hands whereI can see them.

382
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,600
Ok,ok.
Just take it easy.

383
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,590
Jim meyers.
What the hell?

384
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:08,900
- You'rethe mill creek killer?
- What?No.

385
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,340
Then how the helldid you get here?

386
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,290
I got another letter from the hollow man.

387
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,300
Telling you exactly where to findmeredith dale?

388
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,660
I swear.
You can read it.

389
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,700
"Follow the cottonwood trail
throughsaltgrass cove."

390
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:30,560
Wait a minute.
We just figuredthis out ourselves.

391
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,720
How can another killerknow
the specificsabout someone else'sdumpsite?

392
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,750
What's going on?

393
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,990
It's going to beall over the news.

394
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:45,740
Looklikethe hollow man
didn't give youthe exclusive this time.

395
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:50,880
So our plan to catchthe mill creek killer
was ruinedby the hollow man?

396
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,570
And now the hollow man'son a high.

397
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,310
He hasn't pulledthe trigger
since he took2 victims yesterday.

398
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,730
Is he satisfied or
is he just getting started?

399
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,270
We'll find out.

400
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:03,050
"Hollow man helps fbifind
the mill creekkiller's victim."

401
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,320
Nice.He's alerted the media and injected
himselfinto the investigation.

402
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,160
He's getting the attentionhe's been craving.

403
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:10,450
But if the shooterreally wants
to getthe other guy arrested,

404
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,360
he would've called usand not the media.

405
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,200
He must knowthe mill creek killer
needsto revisit the body.

406
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,610
If he can't defilethe woman again,the need'll
become so strong,it could pushhim into a frenzy.

407
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,820
And if that happens,this guy is just
a time bombwaiting to explode.

408
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,480
Excuse me.

409
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,180
Hi.
Look,I'm having a day.

410
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:37,980
My car won't startand I forgot my phone.

411
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,030
Could I use yoursto make a call?

412
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,880
Yeah.
Ok.I know it's here.
I just used it.

413
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,690
What,you know what?
Forget the phone.

414
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,660
Maybe it'll start for you.

415
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,950
Walk with me.
It's rightaround the corner.

416
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,220
- No,that's ok.
- No,come on.

417
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,920
No.
No!

418
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,510
- Walk with me.
- Let go of me!

419
00:26:58,530 --> 00:26:59,780
- Now!
- Let me go!

420
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,200
Help!
Help!

421
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:07,500
Somebody!
Somebody!Help,please!

422
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:10,240
Somebody!
Please!

423
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,430
- At first he seemedso normal.
- Was he handsome?

424
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:16,860
- Excuse me?
- Was he handsome?

425
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,770
Yeah.
He was.

426
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,300
Actually,that'swhy I stopped.

427
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,890
When didhis demeanor change?

428
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,800
After I refusedto go to his car.

429
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:28,950
He grabbedmy arm so hard
I thought thatit would break.

430
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:33,920
I've been watching the newsabout all these women
being abducted,and I just started screaming.

431
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,560
You trustedyour instincts.

432
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,890
Because of that,you're still alive.

433
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:40,640
Miss,there's a sketch artist here with us.

434
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:43,810
He can create a prettyaccurate rendition
from your descriptionof this man.

435
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:46,520
- Would you sit with him?
- Absolutely.

436
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,950
officer.

437
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,230
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

438
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,610
Well,he's becoming
irrational and violentin public.

439
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,500
That's exactlywhat the hollow man
wanted him to do.

440
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,010
Well,if he doesn'tfind a victim soon,
he'll becomemore dangerous.

441
00:28:01,030 --> 00:28:02,620
How's that possible?

442
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,790
He'll dropthe ruse entirely and just
startgrabbing women at random.

443
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,790
Great.
Thanks,man.

444
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,760
The witness gota good look  
at themill creek killer.

445
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:18,710
You know,if it'sthe hollow man's
intentionto force himinto a frenzy,

446
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,430
he's getting what he wants.

447
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,710
He knew exactly where to
find meredith dale's body.

448
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:26,000
He figured out the route
to the dumpsitethe same way we did.

449
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,180
They always sayserial killers
makethe best profilers.

450
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,750
Yeah,butthis guy's dead-on.

451
00:28:36,230 --> 00:28:39,070
Yeah.The headline doesn't
mention the shooter at all.

452
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,970
We talked to jim meyers,the reporter,
asked him not to respondto the letter,

453
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:44,480
he doesn't,and thenthe guy
goes out andshoots 2 more women.

454
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,490
- In a betterpart of town.
- What gives himthis confidence?

455
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:50,230
What's the significance
of the paper at the scene?

456
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,000
We know he wantsto be newsworthy.
He could've justtossed it aside.

457
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,380
Instead,he displayed it.

458
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:59,800
There's somethinghe wants us to look at.
There's definitelysomething in the paper.

459
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,510
I thinkI figured it out.

460
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,990
What is it?

461
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,360
They're talking.
In the classifieds.

462
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,540
classifieds,code names.
This feels likean old spy movie.

463
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,600
It's low-tech,simple,but very effective.

464
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,650
They've beendoing this for months,
and nobody ever knew it.

465
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:22,090
This is the first onethat I found.
The references arewhat made me suspicious.

466
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:24,750
"Sunny,are you an artist too?

467
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:28,210
I'd love to see your work
sometime.Holden."

468
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:30,530
Sunny?
Holden?

469
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:32,870
They're charactersfrom catcher in the rye.

470
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:35,130
Widely acceptedas a loved bookof sociopaths.

471
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,410
Mark david chapman quoted it
after killing john lennon.

472
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:40,960
Deranged minds identifywith
holden's alienationand detachment.

473
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:44,460
I found the initial contact.
It ran in the paperunchanged for months.

474
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:48,450
"We have differenttastes,
but I can appreciate your art.Sunny."

475
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,900
Sunny's the hollow man.
He initiated contact.

476
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,520
- What's he gettingout of it?
- A mentor.

477
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,090
Offered admirationand respect.

478
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,190
In return,he gains 
encouragementand confidence.

479
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:01,330
But when the hollow manremained
unnoticedby the press,

480
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:04,730
he resented his mentor and
turned itinto a rivalry.

481
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,500
Hollow man became jealous.

482
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:09,120
They were both killers,but they weren't
seen in the same playing field.

483
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,470
What else did you find?

484
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:14,510
"An overwhelming area and you never get lost?"

485
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:16,310
Then the answerto this question.

486
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:20,470
"I do my research."
It's not so randomwhen you know the area.

487
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,960
I like cotton woodin sgc."

488
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,740
Sgc?He's talking aboutsaltgrass cove.

489
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,150
- He told him howto find meredith dale.
- Why?

490
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,490
Teaching his studenta lesson.

491
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:33,400
We understandtheir relationship.

492
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,260
Let's use itagainst them.

493
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,050
Hey,sweetness.Make me smile
and tell meyou got a name.

494
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,940
Oh,I got scadsof them,babe,
but none paid for thesepersonal ads.

495
00:30:41,970 --> 00:30:44,790
They went with cash, totally old school.

496
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,960
I hate itwhen they're smart.
2 separate accountsin good standing.

497
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:50,160
Well,these guysare good.
Thanks.

498
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:52,730
Garcia saysthey coveredtheir tracks.
How's it goingin here?

499
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,320
Reid's imitatingthe hollow man'slanguage patterns
to send a messageto the mill creek killer.

500
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:58,480
He's offering condolenceson
losing meredith dale.

501
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,710
Well,if he can'tget to meredith dale,
he's gonna needa body.

502
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,690
He's gonnaneed it real soon.

503
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:05,830
You guys worriedthat the hollow
man's going to ruinour plan again?

504
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,590
He wants the mill creek killer to get caught.

505
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,950
The pupil's tryingto kill the teacher?

506
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:12,800
Hope you're close,reid.

507
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:15,950
You got less than an hour 
to meet the deadline.

508
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,750
You'll be surrounded.

509
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:30,500
Need you to relax...
as best you can.

510
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,950
This guy's going to wantto get close to you,
and he's goingto want to examine you.

511
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,280
He's going to wantto touch me?

512
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:41,530
Since you're a gift,not a marked victim,
he might tryto make you his own.

513
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,940
But we're not going to 
let him get that far.

514
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:46,020
We need him to getclose
to confirmhe's the killer.

515
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,920
There's nothing normal
about this guy.Nothing.

516
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,320
You have any questions?

517
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,490
Let's do this.

518
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,570
Ok.
Down you go.

519
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,640
Close your eyes. Try to relax.

520
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,620
What do you think?
Did it sound likethe hollow man?

521
00:32:22,670 --> 00:32:25,090
Hopefully the mill 
creekkiller will buy it.

522
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:31,360
"Dear holden,they say imitation"
is the highest formof flattery.

523
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,150
"Since you were almostin harm's way,
"I thought I'd sharesome art.

524
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:40,720
Should make youfeel better.
here's my gift to you.sunny.

525
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,990
Hello.

526
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,570
Fbi!
Get down!Stay down!

527
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:16,140
One down,one to go.

528
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:24,400
Stop right here.

529
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,370
It's going to betough to
pushthrough this crowd.

530
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:28,030
That's the idea.

531
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,560
I'm getting out.
Securea path to the door.

532
00:33:34,670 --> 00:33:37,910
Everyone,take a step back.
Get back!

533
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,850
What do you have to sayto the families
of the women you killed?

534
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:44,930
Do you have any remorse
for what you've done?

535
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,330
- You're going to hell.
- You deserve to die!

536
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:00,500
I've alertedall news outletsthat
we'll be holdinga press conferencein 10 minutes.

537
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,210
- And you havethe script?
- Right here.

538
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,780
Be sure to sayexactly those words.

539
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,780
- The wording'simportant,jj.
- Relax.

540
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,080
It's notmy first party,boys.

541
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:10,830
Gideon,we don't havemuch on mill creek,
especially if he sayshe stumbled on the body.

542
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,640
So what arewe going to do?

543
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,850
I'll go tryand do my job.

544
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:24,730
Ok.
Thanks.

545
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,530
You comfortable?

546
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:30,150
As comfortable as 
anyonecan be in handcuffs.

547
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,330
Let me see.

548
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:44,090
I'm jason gideon.

549
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:48,320
You know,I don'tknow
your name or where you're from...

550
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:51,480
the only thingwe do knowis
you'rean intelligent,good-looking man

551
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,110
with an inflated ego who happens
to likekilling women.

552
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:59,270
Well,you had metill that last part...
agent gideon.

553
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:04,620
Imagine how shockedI am,
considering I haven'tdone anything.

554
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,070
I see a woman whoI think is
in distressin the woodsand I get...

555
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,240
pounced on.

556
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,680
Fbi wantsto interview you.
Talk about your work.

557
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:20,310
We never believed we'dhave you in custody.

558
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:24,520
I mean,definitelythought the hollow
man would be easierto catch.

559
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,570
Is that upsetting?

560
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:31,590
I thought the twoof you were friends,
that you admired eachother's work and...

561
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,690
I don't knowthe hollow man.

562
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:37,360
But if I did,I'd say he sounds like an obsessed fan.

563
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,420
Is that howyou see yourself, as somebody famous?

564
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:46,120
Well,from what I've read about the mill
creek killer,I'd say he's an artist.

565
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,970
Fascination wasn'tcompletely one-sided.

566
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:52,000
You did respondto his ads in the paper.

567
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:55,060
No one can respectwhat
the hollow man has done.

568
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,380
He's got no imagination.

569
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,750
But he's smart.

570
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:06,120
Foundmeredith dale's body,
even toldthe media about it.

571
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,530
Whoever taught him, taught him very well.

572
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,110
That's very true.

573
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,630
It just soundslike the student
turnson the teacher.

574
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:15,570
No,no.
He wasprotecting him.

575
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,880
Is that what you think
the hollow manwas doing?

576
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,500
Well,what elsecould it be?

577
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,710
Manipulating you,
gaining your trust.

578
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,270
When he got it,
the hollow manset you up.

579
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:27,390
You werefront page newS.
Now you'd be a footnote.

580
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:31,050
Hollow man's out there,you're in here.
It's all because of him.

581
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,830
Is that what you want?

582
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,510
You want meto get angry
to help you catch him?

583
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,280
That is notyour problem,sir.

584
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,700
Then what do you want?

585
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,950
I have just have one question.

586
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:53,670
If killing those womenmade you an artist,
the thingsyou did to them afterthey were dead...

587
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,600
what does that make you?

588
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,690
I mean,really it...

589
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:01,360
it just doesn't seemvery artistic,does it?

590
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:05,450
You went back,you fix their make-up,
you'd comb their hair.

591
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,410
And you visited them...

592
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:12,470
- over and over and over.
- I didn't do that.

593
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,320
If you thoughtyou were famous before,
wait until the pressgets a hold of you--

594
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,140
- you shut your mouth.
- Details of your visit.

595
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,480
Shut your mouth.
I never went back.

596
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:20,590
You expect meto believe that
you onlykilled those women?

597
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,480
That it wasn'tyou who kept
visitingthe corpses?

598
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:25,910
We foundlipstick in your hand
when we caught you.

599
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:27,790
- You will nottell anyone that.
- Excuse me?

600
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,620
I said you cannever say that.

601
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:31,070
- You didn't visitthe corpses?
- No.

602
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,420
- No,you justkilled them.
- Yes.

603
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,140
Yes.
I killed them.

604
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:42,770
But...but you can'ttell anyone...
that I went back.

605
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:47,290
You can't do that.

606
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,930
The women of st.Louiscan rest easy tonight...

607
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,620
after a long year,the mill
creek killeris in custody.

608
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:57,700
This manis highly intelligent
and he usesa sophisticated rouse

609
00:37:57,730 --> 00:38:00,060
when luring these womenin public places.

610
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,030
The mill creek killeris someone
the bauwill want to study

611
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,700
as one of the mostcomplex criminals
we've dealt with in years.

612
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,870
- Questions?
- Yes?

613
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,380
What's the fbi doingabout
the other serial killer?

614
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,080
We have new information
about that case.

615
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,080
We no longerbelieve
the shootingsare related.

616
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,100
- Yes?
- What's the new information?

617
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,970
We believe they areisolated incidents,

618
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,160
and we're lookinginto the possibility
that the last 2were copycats.

619
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,150
Jim meyers?

620
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,560
Are you referringto the killer
who callshimself the hollow man?

621
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,340
We believe the personwho wrote
that letteris nothingbut a street thug.

622
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:35,090
We have evidencethat indicates
that the letterwas just a prank

623
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:38,090
to throw us offthe investigation
of the mill creek killer.

624
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,470
This is no longera bau case.

625
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:46,450
It lacks a certainsophistication,class,
there'sjust nothing elegantabout it.

626
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:49,470
That's all the questions
we'll take for now.Thank you.

627
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,070
Well,we set the bait,
we'll seeif he takes it.

628
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,990
Place your coins,keys,
belts in the basket.

629
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,050
Walk this way.

630
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,410
Walk this way.

631
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:24,400
Stepto the side,please.

632
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,090
Extend your arms.

633
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:40,450
Stay down.

634
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:43,960
give your weaponright now.

635
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,250
Get up.

636
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,960
Where is he?
I wantto see him right now.

637
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,490
You tell himthe hollow man's here.

638
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:07,350
He told youto say those
things about me,didn't he?

639
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,770
He told youto use those words.

640
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,950
Get him out of here.

641
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,880
I'm no lesselegant than he is.

642
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,280
- I'm no copycat.
- Shut your mouth.

643
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,490
I left youthe newspaper!
I gave youthe mill creek killer!

644
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,640
What elsedo I have to do?

645
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,570
Go!
Get him out of here!

646
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,870
This is the storyfor tomorrow.

647
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:09,440
"they were our daughters,
sisters,brothers,and friends."

648
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:18,510
they have every rightto be remembered...
and memorialized.

649
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,070
*There are nonewho live downtown...*

650
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,900
they didn't mentionthe shooter.

651
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:37,330
He was a nobody whowanted to be somebody
by killing people andthey didn't give him that.

652
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,590
Good.

653
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:46,690
Mahatma gandhi once said,"remember that allthrough
historythere have been tyrants and murderers

654
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:48,620
and for a timethey seem invincible..."

655
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,260
*like ancient bruises...*

656
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,670
"but in the end,they always fall.
Always."

657
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:01,280
*I'm awake to feel...*

658
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:04,010
please tell meyou haven't been
there for the last 4 days.

659
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,380
I heard you wereflying back tonight.

660
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,650
Heard?How couldyou
have heard a thing like that?

661
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:10,710
This was dropped offtoday.

662
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:15,960
I appreciateyour interest,agent,
but profilingis a specialty.

663
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,590
We can't just letanyone
who wants togive it a whirl.

664
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,460
The I-80 killer?
Co-eds in indiana?

665
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,170
Yes,I read iton the plane.

666
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,270
They aren'tblitz attacks.
This guy's organized.

667
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:29,510
He's a white male,early 30s,
and a smooth talker,

668
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:32,770
because evenafter 11 victims,
he can still convince

669
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:36,570
educated women who know there's
a predator out thereto get into his car.

670
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,110
How would youadvise the police?

671
00:42:38,130 --> 00:42:41,400
I would stake outthe ranch house,
a night club in gary.

672
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:44,150
They have a very popular
ladies night on thursdays.

673
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:48,340
If you look closely,you'll see that 8 outof
the 11 victimswent missingon a friday morning.

674
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:51,950
So something gets this creep's
motor runningon thursdays.

675
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:58,060
This isn't a whirl,agent hotchner.

676
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:00,190
I don't know how thepaperwork
got screwed up

677
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:04,810
or maybe youbelieve my parents pulled
some strings,which they didn't,by the way.

678
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,800
I belong in this unit.

679
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:11,210
And all I'masking you for
is the chanceto show you that.

680
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:19,230
I still needto look into this.
I'm notpromising anything.

681
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,880
Understood.

682
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:22,910
We brief new cases
every morning at 10:00 am.

683
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,000
You can see facilities
management about a desk.

684
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:27,360
You won't be sorry.
