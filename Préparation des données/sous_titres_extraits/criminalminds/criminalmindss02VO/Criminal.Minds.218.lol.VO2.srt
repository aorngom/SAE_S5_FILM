1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:02,300
Previously on Criminal Minds...

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,000
Please, I don't want it.
I don't want it.

3
00:00:06,035 --> 00:00:07,200
It helps.

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,100
What is the matter with you ?

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,400
What do you mean, what's
the matter with me ?

6
00:00:25,435 --> 00:00:27,000
I have never seen
you act like this.

7
00:00:27,035 --> 00:00:28,600
Really ?  Oh, in the months
that you know me,

8
00:00:28,635 --> 00:00:29,700
You've never seen me act this way ?

9
00:00:29,735 --> 00:00:31,300
Hey, no offense, Emily, but...

10
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,500
You don't really know what
you're talking about, do you ?

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,800
Earlier this morning katrina
crashed into the gulf coast,

12
00:00:37,835 --> 00:00:40,800
With sustained winds
above 125 an hour.

13
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:42,300
As many houses are being destroyed.

14
00:00:42,335 --> 00:00:44,300
Residents are trying to evacuate.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,000
Are you listening to me, pop ?

16
00:00:51,035 --> 00:00:52,800
Grab your wallet and get
the hell out of there.

17
00:00:52,835 --> 00:00:53,900
The buses are filling up.

18
00:00:53,935 --> 00:00:55,600
This case is eatin' at me, Billy.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,800
Dad.

20
00:00:56,835 --> 00:00:58,000
Forget the damn case.

21
00:00:58,035 --> 00:00:59,700
What the hell am I missing here ?

22
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:01,400
Dad, people are drowning in their homes.

23
00:01:01,435 --> 00:01:04,700
The... Whole world's
gonna be underwater.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,900
I got another letter, Billy.

25
00:01:06,935 --> 00:01:09,300
Screw the letter.
Forget the serial killer.

26
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,500
They're opening the superdome.

27
00:01:10,535 --> 00:01:11,800
I want you to meet me there.

28
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,300
I'll be damned.

29
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:16,500
... Please, I'm begging you, pop.

30
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,300
Pop ?

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,700
Behavioral analysis unit

32
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:00,600
We've got a serial killer
in New Orleans

33
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:03,300
Who killed at least
3 men pre-Katrina.

34
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:05,400
Until now, the New Orleans
police department

35
00:02:05,435 --> 00:02:07,600
Believed that the serial
killer died in the storm.

36
00:02:07,635 --> 00:02:09,200
What's happened to tell
them otherwise ?

37
00:02:09,235 --> 00:02:12,200
A fourth body was found in
the french quarter last night.

38
00:02:12,235 --> 00:02:13,900
Same M.O. Another male.

39
00:02:13,935 --> 00:02:15,800
Throat slashed, eviscerated.

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,000
A year and a half ?  That's a
long cooling-Off period.

41
00:02:18,035 --> 00:02:19,600
Are we sure this
is the same unsub ?

42
00:02:19,635 --> 00:02:20,700
He claims to be.

43
00:02:20,735 --> 00:02:22,500
He sent a letter
to William Lamontagne,

44
00:02:22,535 --> 00:02:24,200
The head detective on the case.

45
00:02:24,235 --> 00:02:25,700
Does Lamontagne have any leads ?

46
00:02:25,735 --> 00:02:27,400
He died in Katrina.

47
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,300
His son is actually
leading the case now.

48
00:02:30,335 --> 00:02:32,000
Hmm. That can't be easy.

49
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,600
Well, we need to pour over the evidence

50
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:35,600
From the first 3 murders
and determine the pattern.

51
00:02:35,635 --> 00:02:37,100
Katrina washed everything away.

52
00:02:37,135 --> 00:02:40,700
The 3 victims we know of,
their autopsy reports,

53
00:02:40,735 --> 00:02:42,000
Witness statements.

54
00:02:42,035 --> 00:02:43,100
DNA test results.

55
00:02:43,135 --> 00:02:45,800
So, basically, all we have
to go on is the latest victim ?

56
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Yeah.

57
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,900
Until he kills again.

58
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,500
Criminal minds 218

59
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,900
Robert Kennedy once said,

60
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:32,600
"Tragedy is a tool for
the living to gain wisdom,

61
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:34,800
Not a guide by which to live."

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,100
Hey, Reid.

63
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,100
What's goin' on up there ?

64
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,900
From Las Vegas... Ethan.

65
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,300
I'm pretty sure he lives
in New Orleans now.

66
00:03:46,335 --> 00:03:48,000
Really ?  Gonna give him a call ?

67
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,600
Grew up competing against each other

68
00:03:49,635 --> 00:03:50,700
In absolutely everything.

69
00:03:50,735 --> 00:03:52,600
Spelling bees, science fairs.

70
00:03:52,635 --> 00:03:55,300
We also both had our hearts set
on joining the bureau, but...

71
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,000
First day at quantico he backed out.

72
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,300
He probably just couldn't take the heat.

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,900
It's not really for us
to judge, is it ?

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,200
Right.

75
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,000
My bad.

76
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:09,300
These are copies of the newspaper
articles on the murders,

77
00:04:09,335 --> 00:04:12,400
Dating back to early august 2005.

78
00:04:12,435 --> 00:04:13,700
It's all we have to go on.

79
00:04:13,735 --> 00:04:15,900
He killed 3 times,
he stopped for 18 months,

80
00:04:15,935 --> 00:04:17,400
Then he started killing again.

81
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:18,700
We should have garcia run a list

82
00:04:18,735 --> 00:04:20,500
Of any offenders in the area.

83
00:04:20,535 --> 00:04:22,900
Anyone who spent the last year
and a half doing time.

84
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:25,900
Or anyone that relocated after
Katrina and recently moved back.

85
00:04:25,935 --> 00:04:28,900
What is the victimology
in killing a mechanic,

86
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,000
A real estate broker, and a cook,

87
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:33,700
With ages ranging from 22 to 45 ?

88
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:36,900
And this latest is
a 33-Year-Old taxi driver.

89
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:38,900
They just don't seem to have
very much in common.

90
00:04:38,935 --> 00:04:41,300
Besides being male and walking
the french quarter late at night.

91
00:04:41,335 --> 00:04:43,900
Which is notorious for muggings
off the main drag.

92
00:04:43,935 --> 00:04:47,300
Yeah, but this guy isn't
in a rush to flee the scene.

93
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,200
A slaughter like this takes time.

94
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:51,800
Andrei Chikatilo fantasized that
the men he killed were his captives

95
00:04:51,835 --> 00:04:53,600
And then torturing and mutilating them

96
00:04:53,635 --> 00:04:54,800
Somehow made him a hero.

97
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,700
The city's barely back to life.

98
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,100
Something like this could
cripple its psyche.

99
00:04:59,135 --> 00:05:00,500
So where do we start ?

100
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,300
Well, with no case file there's
only one place we can start.

101
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
At square one.

102
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,100
You must be B.A.U.

103
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,000
Bill Lamontagne.

104
00:05:15,035 --> 00:05:16,800
Hi. Jennifer Jareau.
We spoke on the phone.

105
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,100
Well, ok, then.

106
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,000
I pictured you different.

107
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Uh, these are agents
Gideon and Morgan.

108
00:05:24,135 --> 00:05:26,900
This is detective
William Lamontagne JR.

109
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,900
Appreciate you guys being here.

110
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,800
My daddy was too stubborn
to ever ask for any help.

111
00:05:31,835 --> 00:05:33,300
Sorry for your loss.

112
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,000
I understand you received a letter.

113
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:39,100
Yeah. Before they were
lost in Katrina,

114
00:05:39,135 --> 00:05:40,700
My daddy received 2 letters.

115
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,700
This one came addressed to him yesterday.

116
00:05:42,735 --> 00:05:44,100
They passed it on to me.

117
00:05:44,135 --> 00:05:45,700
You sure it's from
the same killer ?

118
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,800
It's a detailed account
of what he did to the body.

119
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,100
4 layers of fatty tissue
sliced through like butter.

120
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,300
I only seen that 3 other times.

121
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:56,500
You work this case initially ?

122
00:05:56,535 --> 00:05:58,700
Nah. You don't forget victims like this.

123
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,400
It's like they were dissected.

124
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:02,300
I can still smell the alcohol on him.

125
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:03,300
This is New Orleans.

126
00:06:03,335 --> 00:06:05,700
Dead or alive,
it' a smell you get used to.

127
00:06:05,735 --> 00:06:07,600
The victim has no defense wounds.

128
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:09,900
Meaning this is most
likely a blitz attack.

129
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,900
No hesitation marks or rapid thrusts.

130
00:06:16,935 --> 00:06:18,300
Cuts were methodical.

131
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:19,600
Almost procedural.

132
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:22,600
My guess... Whoever gutted
this guy was taught to.

133
00:06:22,635 --> 00:06:24,300
So you think he might have
some medical training ?

134
00:06:24,335 --> 00:06:26,400
How else could he carve
around every organ

135
00:06:26,435 --> 00:06:27,800
And leave each one intact ?

136
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:30,100
Have any of his relatives
come to claim the body ?

137
00:06:30,135 --> 00:06:31,400
Anyone we could speak with ?

138
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:34,400
No. I'll end up boxing up
the poor bastard's ashes,

139
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,500
Left to collect dust in storage.

140
00:06:36,535 --> 00:06:39,000
All the bodies I've been through
in the last year and a half,

141
00:06:39,035 --> 00:06:40,700
It's a wonder I still have room.

142
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
It'd be pretty easy to hide out
in one of these alcoves,

143
00:06:49,835 --> 00:06:51,800
Wait for the victim
without ever being seen.

144
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,700
Yeah, all 4 murders occurred
within a 10-Block radius

145
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:56,400
Here inside the french quarter.

146
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,100
On any given night, there'd
have to be thousands of people

147
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:01,000
Walking through here from the bars.

148
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:02,300
Tens of thousands.

149
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,700
When I first started as a cop,

150
00:07:03,735 --> 00:07:04,900
I worked the quarter.

151
00:07:04,935 --> 00:07:07,000
It's like being in the riot
squad every night.

152
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:09,200
Every sunday I'd get off
work around sunrise,

153
00:07:09,235 --> 00:07:10,700
I'm ready to pass out,

154
00:07:10,735 --> 00:07:12,600
My daddy'd be waiting
for me at my house.

155
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,936
Make me drive him uptown to Frankie
and Johnny's for poorboys.

156
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,900
Called it communing with New Orleans.

157
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,899
Did your father tell you anything else
about this case that we should know ?

158
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,300
He tried to.

159
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,800
But you guys should
see that for yourself.

160
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,800
This wall is still standing
where daddy carved the message

161
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:34,200
Right before he died.

162
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,000
There's no doubt he's still
working from the grave.

163
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,400
"Jones." That name mean
anything to you ?

164
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,100
No. I ran it through the database

165
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,800
Against every offender
in New Orleans.

166
00:07:49,835 --> 00:07:51,900
And you can imagine
how many hits I got.

167
00:07:51,935 --> 00:07:54,400
But nothing came up
in connection with this case.

168
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,200
But in your dad's final moments,

169
00:07:56,235 --> 00:07:58,800
It was the most important
thing he wanted to say.

170
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,000
Learned how to play
the drums in this house,

171
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,000
Grew up with 2 dogs in this house.

172
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,800
All it's gonna be now is the word
"jones" carved into that wall.

173
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,000
Detective, if he had
written the unsub's name,

174
00:08:11,035 --> 00:08:12,800
I think you would have
found him by now.

175
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,500
Jones is the one
piece of the puzzle

176
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,900
That your daddy did know.

177
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,900
He trusted you to figure out the rest.

178
00:08:17,935 --> 00:08:19,200
Yeah, I know it.

179
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,000
But I've pored over
it a thousand times

180
00:08:21,035 --> 00:08:22,700
And I still can't put it together.

181
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,400
I can't get it out of my head.

182
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
You ok ?

183
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,700
Yeah.

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,200
I just don't want to disappoint him.

185
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,100
Is that the letter from the unsub ?

186
00:08:43,135 --> 00:08:43,900
Yeah.

187
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,300
I'm back with a vengeance.

188
00:08:45,335 --> 00:08:46,500
I wanted you to know.

189
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:49,100
The last guy made it easy,
being out so late,

190
00:08:49,135 --> 00:08:50,200
Stumbling home drunk.

191
00:08:50,235 --> 00:08:52,100
I enjoyed slicing around his organs.

192
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:53,900
I thought about sending you one.

193
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,800
He was asking to be ripped,
don't you think, boss ?

194
00:08:56,835 --> 00:08:57,600
Yours truly."

195
00:08:57,635 --> 00:08:58,400
Hey.

196
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,700
Ok.

197
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
To say that the victims
were asking to be killed

198
00:09:05,235 --> 00:09:06,400
Denies all culpability.

199
00:09:06,435 --> 00:09:08,400
Most sexual sadists rationalize
their own behavior

200
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:09,700
By blaming the victims like that.

201
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:12,300
But there was no evidence
of sexual assault in the autopsy.

202
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,000
He could be a homosexual male

203
00:09:15,035 --> 00:09:17,300
Stabbing because he needs
violence for arousal.

204
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,100
Every kill he's acting
out a fantasy of revenge.

205
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:23,400
What if he's trying to act
out something else ?  Like what ?

206
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:26,300
Except for the victims were men,
it's the same M.O.

207
00:09:26,335 --> 00:09:27,300
What are you talking about ?

208
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,600
All 4 victims were found with
their throats slashed, eviscerated,

209
00:09:30,635 --> 00:09:33,100
And the murders perpetrated
in semi-Public places after dark.

210
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,300
Investigators taunted with
the letters addressed to "boss."

211
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,300
The only difference is that
case was 100 years ago

212
00:09:38,335 --> 00:09:39,400
And the murders took place in London.

213
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,900
Jack the ripper.

214
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,000
The unsub wants us to think

215
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:46,400
That he's the modern-Day version
loose in New Orleans.

216
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,900
Please.Don't

217
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,770
So the 3 of you were out
together last night ?

218
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,470
Mark had just paid his tab at one bar

219
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:08,970
And he was on his way
to meet us at another.

220
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,070
You guys get in any trouble ?

221
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,170
Drunken brawl ?
Anyone get out of hand ?

222
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:14,370
We were just out
to have fun, you know ?

223
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,970
Minded our own business.

224
00:10:16,005 --> 00:10:17,070
Could mark have met a girl ?

225
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,670
Maybe upset her boyfriend ?

226
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:19,670
No, sir.

227
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,870
He struck out like we all did.

228
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,370
Thanks, guys.

229
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:24,170
Ok.

230
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,070
Getting hard to keep up
with this guy.

231
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,970
Well, if he's mimicking
Jack the ripper,

232
00:10:32,005 --> 00:10:33,570
That might be precisely the point.

233
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,770
He terrorized london for months

234
00:10:35,805 --> 00:10:36,770
Without ever getting caught.

235
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:39,170
I'd appreciate it
if you'd gather your men.

236
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:41,570
We'd like to give you a profile
of who you're up against.

237
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,670
The offender we're looking
for is friendly,

238
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,570
Agile, somewhere between 30 and 35.

239
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:49,370
He'll allure with charm

240
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,070
And kill with rage.

241
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:52,870
We believe he's murdering men

242
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:54,470
To reclaim his power.

243
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,770
This unsub suffers
from low self-Esteem,

244
00:10:56,805 --> 00:10:58,270
But he probably covers it well.

245
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,870
He dresses impeccably
to feed the facade.

246
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:02,370
Jack the ripper himself

247
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:04,170
Was an impetuous lust murderer,

248
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:07,870
Whereas this offender is organized,

249
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,370
Calculating.

250
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,570
He might even stalk
his victims for days

251
00:11:11,605 --> 00:11:12,870
Before the actual kill.

252
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,270
We believe this killer identifies
with Jack the ripper

253
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,970
Because he's lost his own identity.

254
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:24,170
Maybe through years
of child abuse...

255
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,070
Or some catastrophic event.

256
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,670
Because he overcompensates
to hide his insecurities,

257
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:33,170
We believe he may hold a position
of authority at work.

258
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,770
And since we think he's had
medical training,

259
00:11:35,805 --> 00:11:39,470
Consider emts, doctors, veterinarians.

260
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,770
Please be careful.

261
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:41,770
For this unsub,

262
00:11:41,805 --> 00:11:43,470
The french quarter's
a hunting ground.

263
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,570
He's certainly already proven
he knows the terrain.

264
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,170
Jeez !

265
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,270
Reid, you scared me.

266
00:12:08,305 --> 00:12:09,970
Always been one step
ahead of you, man.

267
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:12,070
Yeah, whatever helps
you sleep at night.

268
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,370
I'm glad you called.
It's good to see you.

269
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,870
You, too.

270
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,870
Let's get a drink.

271
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,570
Prentiss.

272
00:12:23,605 --> 00:12:24,570
What was the thing

273
00:12:24,605 --> 00:12:26,670
Jack the ripper took from
one of his victims ?

274
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,870
Besides, well, you know, her life ?

275
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:30,270
Oh. Uh... Uh...

276
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,370
Mmm.

277
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,270
Tick tock...

278
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:35,270
Tick tock.

279
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:37,170
I don't know.

280
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,870
A kidney.

281
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,570
How horrify ingly
fantastic is that ?

282
00:12:41,605 --> 00:12:44,170
Mm-Hmm. And are you
going anywhere with this ?

283
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:47,470
Just that I found an unsolved murder
that happened 4 months ago

284
00:12:47,505 --> 00:12:48,870
In Galveston, Texas,

285
00:12:48,905 --> 00:12:50,170
With the same M.O.,

286
00:12:50,205 --> 00:12:51,170
The victim missing

287
00:12:51,205 --> 00:12:53,070
That very organ.

288
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,470
I amaze myself.

289
00:12:56,505 --> 00:12:58,770
Yeah. Me, too.

290
00:12:58,805 --> 00:12:59,670
Great work.

291
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:01,370
What's that ?

292
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,870
Garcia found a similar
case in Galveston, Texas.

293
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,270
A lot of Katrina refugees
relocated there.

294
00:13:06,305 --> 00:13:07,270
It could be the same guy.

295
00:13:07,305 --> 00:13:09,470
He removed the kidney
just like Jack the ripper.

296
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,670
Call Reid and Morgan.

297
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,870
I want the 3 of you on a plane
to Texas tonight.

298
00:13:12,905 --> 00:13:13,670
Ok.

299
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,270
So...

300
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,370
Are you gonna ask the question ?

301
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:28,470
What question ?

302
00:13:28,505 --> 00:13:29,470
Come on, man.

303
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:31,070
It's me here.

304
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,170
We haven't talked
to each other in years.

305
00:13:33,205 --> 00:13:34,470
I know it's why you called me.

306
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:35,570
Ask the question.

307
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,970
Why did you quit after only
one day of fbi training ?

308
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:42,970
Well...

309
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,570
I'm sure you've
considered the evidence,

310
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:50,670
Analyzed the signs.

311
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,770
You were battling what's
your own demons.

312
00:13:54,805 --> 00:13:56,670
You didn't have time
to analyze someone else's.

313
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,070
Not bad. Not bad.

314
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:02,670
Those days, I did prefer
Jack Daniel's to Jeff Dahmer.

315
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:05,970
They both weigh on
your soul eventually.

316
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:08,970
Sorry

317
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,470
The bat phone.

318
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,470
Let me ask you this, Ethan.

319
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,570
Do you ever regret it ?

320
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,470
You know, I may not be
changing the world, but...

321
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,270
My music makes me happy.

322
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,970
It doesn't take a profiler
to see that you're not.

323
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,870
It's not easy. And it's not...

324
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,670
I... don't think you'd believe some of
the things that I've seen.

325
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,070
John Coltrane.

326
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:44,070
He was a genius, too.

327
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:45,270
Died of cancer.

328
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:48,270
But most people think
it was the booze and heroin

329
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:49,170
That did him in.

330
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:50,670
What are you tryingsay ?

331
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:52,270
You look like hell.

332
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:55,070
I'm fine.

333
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:55,970
Come on, man.

334
00:14:56,005 --> 00:14:57,870
I'm a jazz musician
in New Orleans.

335
00:14:57,905 --> 00:15:00,470
I know what it looks like
when someone's not well.

336
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,870
This may be the one time
I can tell you something

337
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,470
That you don't already know.

338
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,370
That might help you forget,

339
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,070
But it won't make it go away.

340
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:11,470
And if I can tell...

341
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,770
You're surrounded by some of
the best minds in the world,

342
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,270
And if you think they don't notice...

343
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,370
Well...

344
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,370
For a genius,

345
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,870
That's just dumb.

346
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,470
Hey. Hey.

347
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:36,870
Where's Reid ?

348
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,570
I was hoping he was with you.

349
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,670
I thought you said you called him.

350
00:15:40,705 --> 00:15:42,470
I did, 4 times. Nothing.

351
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,070
The victim's fiancee is expecting us.

352
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:48,570
What are we supposed to do ?

353
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,170
We got one option.

354
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:54,670
Wheels up.

355
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,570
Thank you.

356
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,070
It's not right.

357
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,670
The french quarter's one of the only
parts of the city that dodged Katrina.

358
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,670
Now there's a serial killer loose.

359
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:08,970
It's a small area,

360
00:16:09,005 --> 00:16:10,570
And we're narrowing down the profile.

361
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,270
We'll find him.

362
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,870
You always drink while
you're still on the clock ?

363
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,570
This is New Orleans, honey.

364
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,270
It's a cultural thing.

365
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:22,970
Where are you from ?

366
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:25,670
Pennsylvania.

367
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,870
I take it the folks

368
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,970
Are a little rigid about
the rules up that way.

369
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,070
Well, if it makes you feel better...

370
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:39,070
We'll play it
Pennsylvania style tonight.

371
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,470
I just hate that this guy
has a leg up on us, you know ?

372
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:48,770
I promise, as soon as my team
knows anything, we'll hear.

373
00:16:48,805 --> 00:16:49,670
Ok ?

374
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,570
Why aren't you married ?

375
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:00,570
Uh, that involves this case how ?

376
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:01,670
It doesn't.

377
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,570
I'm just flirtin'.

378
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,870
It's unprofessional.

379
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,670
You don't have to answer that.

380
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:09,870
Excuse me.

381
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:12,070
Compliments of the woman
in the blue top.

382
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:20,070
Wow. That was... bold.

383
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,770
She might have thought
we were just working.

384
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:25,770
We are.

385
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,170
Are you jealous ?

386
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,770
No. I just... I...

387
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,370
I'm surprised, that's all.

388
00:17:34,405 --> 00:17:35,870
And you're a lousy liar, too.

389
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,170
You haven't had much practice, huh ?

390
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,170
It's a culture thing.

391
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:43,870
You see.

392
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,170
There you go.

393
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:48,470
Everybody kept sayg

394
00:17:48,505 --> 00:17:50,770
Crime's gonna skyrocket
after the relocation.

395
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,670
You just never think
it's gonna happen to you.

396
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,870
The report said that your fiance

397
00:17:57,905 --> 00:17:59,970
Was bar-Hopping for his bachelor party

398
00:18:00,005 --> 00:18:01,770
On the night he was killed.

399
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,270
We were supposed
to be married in october.

400
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,370
He was just out
celebrating that with friends.

401
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,870
Was there anyone at Leonard's
bachelor party

402
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:12,770
You didn't know ?

403
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,670
We all grew up together.

404
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,470
They're like family to me.

405
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:20,070
Whether they met
somebody out, you know,

406
00:18:20,105 --> 00:18:20,970
That's a different story.

407
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,070
They're a rowdy bunch.

408
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,770
And they'd party with anybody.

409
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,270
Each of the last 2 victims
was traveling in a group.

410
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,270
Both were drinking, both
in public arenas, bar-Hopping.

411
00:18:36,305 --> 00:18:38,670
So how could their friends
not see anything ?

412
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:43,170
It like when a lion preys
upon an antelope.

413
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:45,070
You lost me.

414
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,670
That's because you,
Emily Prentiss,

415
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:50,070
Have never been
one of the antelope.

416
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:52,670
Oh, scratch that.
You totally lost me.

417
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:54,570
Ok. Check this out.

418
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,370
The antelope travel in packs.

419
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,270
So the lion just sits and waits.

420
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,770
Waits for just one of the antelope

421
00:19:02,805 --> 00:19:04,070
To break away from its herd.

422
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:06,170
So when he's alone,

423
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,570
Vulnerable, and completely unprotected,

424
00:19:09,370 --> 00:19:10,370
That's when the lion strikes.

425
00:19:10,405 --> 00:19:11,770
That's when she makes her move.

426
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:13,570
Wait a minute. Her move ?

427
00:19:13,605 --> 00:19:15,270
Prentiss, there's only one thing

428
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:16,170
That's gonna make a straight man

429
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,570
Leave his friends on guys night out.

430
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,270
And it'll make him leave every time.

431
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,470
One of the victims was out
for his bachelor party.

432
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,270
Another one out with just the guys.

433
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,670
What's the only temptation

434
00:19:29,705 --> 00:19:32,170
That's gonna lure these men
away from each other ?  A woman.

435
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:34,570
J.J.

436
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,170
Ok.

437
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,070
Yeah, he's right here with me.

438
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:43,170
Thanks.

439
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:45,470
What's going on ?

440
00:19:45,505 --> 00:19:47,570
The ansub...

441
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,270
Hey.

442
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:06,570
We're not making a media
spectacle out of this.

443
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:08,570
People need to know that
this killer is a woman.

444
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:11,770
What ?

445
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,570
Listen.

446
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:16,070
Tourists are just starting
to filter back here.

447
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,570
That's not the issue.

448
00:20:17,605 --> 00:20:20,670
I can't create mass hysteria
in a city trying to rebuild.

449
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,170
Besides, we'll be playing
right into her hands.

450
00:20:23,205 --> 00:20:24,170
So be it.

451
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,870
Look, um...

452
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:29,370
I'm trying not to go
above your head here.

453
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,670
Yeah.

454
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,170
I got that.

455
00:20:34,205 --> 00:20:35,670
Then set up the press conference.

456
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,670
Hey, you guys are
back from Galveston ?

457
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:42,470
First light this
morning. Where were you ?

458
00:20:42,670 --> 00:20:44,370
I was out with a friend.
I already told you.

459
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,170
I called you 4 times.

460
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,970
I didn't have any cell
phone reception,

461
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:49,270
So I didn't get your
message until late.

462
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,670
Right.

463
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:53,270
What's going on ?

464
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:56,070
Our unsub's a woman.

465
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,870
We just found another
body in the quarter.

466
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:02,870
Throat's been cut.

467
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,770
He's been disemboweled, too.

468
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,270
Reeks of booze.

469
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:10,870
It's more than a pattern.

470
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,170
Only this time he cut
off the earlobe.

471
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:15,070
She's sticking with
the ripper's paradigm.

472
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,270
What do you mean ?

473
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:18,170
In one letter
of correspondence,

474
00:21:18,205 --> 00:21:20,270
Jack the ripper promised
to cut the earlobe off

475
00:21:20,305 --> 00:21:21,270
Of his next victim.

476
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:22,670
He did.

477
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:24,570
It was the one day
that he killed twice.

478
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:27,570
So she's gonna kill again
by the end of the day.

479
00:21:27,605 --> 00:21:29,970
Ok, what do we know about
female serial killers ?

480
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,370
Basically, you have 2 types.

481
00:21:32,405 --> 00:21:33,670
The sante kimes model.

482
00:21:33,705 --> 00:21:34,970
Cold, calculating.

483
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:36,370
Preys on men for money.

484
00:21:36,405 --> 00:21:37,970
Takes her time building
relationships.

485
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:38,970
It's more likely
we're dealing with

486
00:21:39,005 --> 00:21:40,470
The aileen wuornos archetype,

487
00:21:40,505 --> 00:21:42,070
Motivated by paranoia and fear,

488
00:21:42,105 --> 00:21:43,270
Luring men with sex.

489
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,870
Our unsub's organized.
She follows a routine.

490
00:21:45,905 --> 00:21:48,670
She meets men in a bar,
flirts with them over drinks,

491
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,970
And suggests that they consummate
the evening in an alley.

492
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,870
We need to be in those streets.

493
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,470
Office just brought me this.

494
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,370
Dear boss,

495
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,170
By now I have rid the
world of one more.

496
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,770
So many men, so little time.

497
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,870
I hope you don't mind the mess.

498
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,470
They make is so easy,

499
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:11,170
I just can't help myself.

500
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:12,670
Yours truly.

501
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,970
So were looking for a woman
who will approach men,

502
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,070
Comfortable being
the aggressor, no ?

503
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,070
And I'm guessing she'd have
to be quite attractive

504
00:22:28,105 --> 00:22:29,570
In order to lure them away.

505
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,570
Most of the women are out in groups,

506
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:37,070
So keep your eyes open
for someone on their own.

507
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:43,170
"So many men, so little time."

508
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,670
So she's on a quest...

509
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,670
To wipe out the race.

510
00:22:48,970 --> 00:22:51,370
Or... the father
who molested her ?

511
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,270
Some people think Jack
the ripper mutilated women

512
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:56,970
After his mother sexually
abused him for years.

513
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,870
For someone so enraged...

514
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:03,270
This unsub sounds oddly apologetic

515
00:23:03,305 --> 00:23:05,070
For leaving a bloody crime scene.

516
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,270
Why ?

517
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,870
That might be what
Lamontagne figured out

518
00:23:10,905 --> 00:23:12,070
Right before he died.

519
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,070
You gotta admit, these guys
are making it pretty easy.

520
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:17,970
I wouldn't follow
a stranger into an alley

521
00:23:18,005 --> 00:23:19,370
No matter how wasted I was.

522
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:20,470
Yeah, but you're not a man.

523
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,770
Testosterone will follow
a woman to Thailand.

524
00:23:22,805 --> 00:23:23,670
Barefoot.

525
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,270
It's just a fact.

526
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,770
Did you give that newest
letter to Reid ?

527
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:36,070
He knows that ripper case inside out.

528
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:38,670
He might see something I'm missing.

529
00:23:38,705 --> 00:23:39,770
I don't think, uh...

530
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,070
What is it ?

531
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,970
Nothing.

532
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,770
Come on.

533
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,170
You think I'm not aware
something's going on with him ?

534
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,170
You gonna tell me why you missed
that flight to Galveston ?

535
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,970
I already told you.

536
00:23:57,005 --> 00:23:58,370
It was no cell reception.

537
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,670
Right.

538
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,270
What ?

539
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:04,270
I mean, anytime
you want to come up

540
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:05,670
With a better answer,
I'm standing right here.

541
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:11,570
Dark Curls, 3 o'clock.

542
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:12,570
I got it.

543
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:18,170
She's eyeing those guys
outside that bar.

544
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,070
Let's go.

545
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,170
Oh !  Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

546
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,470
I hate it when that happens.

547
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:35,670
You all right ?

548
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,170
What can I do to say I'm sorry ?

549
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,370
How about a drink ?

550
00:24:41,970 --> 00:24:43,470
Have a drink. That's cool.

551
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:44,570
That's cool.

552
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:46,870
Sure.

553
00:24:46,905 --> 00:24:48,570
Yeah, that's totally fine.

554
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,570
Yeah...

555
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,870
Yeah.

556
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,870
Danny.

557
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,770
You fool.

558
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,570
You dropped your wallet out there.

559
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:00,270
Thanks.

560
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,770
Next drink is on me.

561
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,270
So...

562
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,670
Where are your friends tonight ?

563
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,670
I didn't bring any.

564
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,870
They get in the way.

565
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,370
Now, see, I like that.

566
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,070
'Cause, uh, most girls,

567
00:25:20,670 --> 00:25:22,170
They won't go nowhere alone.

568
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,570
I'm not most girls.

569
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,470
We got nothin'.

570
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:42,970
Well, the day's almost over,

571
00:25:43,005 --> 00:25:44,470
So if you're right,
we just ran out of time.

572
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:54,470
Your hair's wet.

573
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,370
Oh, my god !  Aah !

574
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,470
She's mocking us.

575
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,870
And she's true to her word.

576
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,270
Do you have any tweezers ?

577
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,270
Thank you.

578
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,170
What is that ?

579
00:26:23,205 --> 00:26:24,370
I have no idea.

580
00:26:28,870 --> 00:26:30,870
It's a note from the unsub,

581
00:26:31,170 --> 00:26:32,370
Addressed to your father.

582
00:26:32,405 --> 00:26:33,170
Let's see it.

583
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,070
Dear boss,

584
00:26:36,105 --> 00:26:36,970
He wanted it,

585
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,070
With that sharp tongue
and vulgar hand.

586
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,670
Thought you'd like to know

587
00:26:40,705 --> 00:26:43,170
Another will soon
get what he deserves.

588
00:26:43,205 --> 00:26:44,370
Yours truly.

589
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:47,870
It's weird. Typically, offenders
write letters to be heard.

590
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,970
Jack the ripper bragged
about not being caught.

591
00:26:50,005 --> 00:26:51,470
This unsub isn't
using correspondence

592
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:52,970
To flaunt her latest kill,

593
00:26:53,005 --> 00:26:54,970
Only to explain why she did it.

594
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,970
It's possible she considers
herself a vigilante.

595
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:01,070
That the men she's killing
deserve to die.

596
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:03,270
Or maybe she's contacting your father,

597
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:05,270
Not because he was the lead detective

598
00:27:05,305 --> 00:27:06,270
On the case, but...

599
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,670
Because she believes he'd understand.

600
00:27:09,970 --> 00:27:11,470
You think he knew her somehow ?

601
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,170
Can you think of a woman
in your dad's life

602
00:27:14,205 --> 00:27:16,070
He helped through a tough time ?

603
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,070
Might be another police officer,

604
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,570
I don't know, a prostitute
he helped get off the street ?

605
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:22,370
He hasn't dealt with prostitutes

606
00:27:22,405 --> 00:27:24,370
Since he worked sex crimes.

607
00:27:24,405 --> 00:27:27,770
The unsub wrote,
"he was asking to be ripped."

608
00:27:27,805 --> 00:27:30,470
"I just couldn't help
myself," and he wanted it."

609
00:27:30,505 --> 00:27:33,570
What if she's mirroring
the man who raped her ?

610
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:36,870
Where are the files stored
from your sex crime division ?

611
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,570
They were housed the same
place as homicide.

612
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,170
Most of them were washed away.

613
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,870
Did your dad have a partner ?

614
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,370
Yeah. J.R. Smith.

615
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:45,470
Smitty, they called him.

616
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,970
He might remember something.

617
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,170
Yeah, but they had a falling out.

618
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:50,170
What about ?

619
00:27:50,205 --> 00:27:53,170
I don't know. They stopped
talking when he left sex crimes.

620
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:59,070
Do you have a problem calling him ?

621
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,470
Not if it means breaking this case.

622
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:07,870
May I borrow your hand for a minute ?

623
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,170
I'll be damned.

624
00:28:17,205 --> 00:28:17,970
What is it ?

625
00:28:18,005 --> 00:28:19,570
The stamp on the victim's hand...

626
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,770
It's admittance into the mon cherie.

627
00:28:21,805 --> 00:28:23,170
It's a bar in the french quarter.

628
00:28:23,205 --> 00:28:23,970
Oh, yeah ?

629
00:28:24,005 --> 00:28:24,770
Yeah.

630
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,870
9 years ago it was called Jones.

631
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,570
Bingo.

632
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:33,670
Get Garcia on the horn.

633
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,570
O captain, my captain.

634
00:28:38,605 --> 00:28:39,570
I need you.

635
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:40,970
Anything. Talk to me.

636
00:28:41,005 --> 00:28:42,470
Is there any newspaper reports

637
00:28:42,505 --> 00:28:44,970
About a rape at a bar called Jones ?

638
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:48,770
Zilch.

639
00:28:48,805 --> 00:28:50,070
You sure ?  It would have beenav

640
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:51,070
About 9 years ago.

641
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:52,670
Nada.

642
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,670
Ok. Uh...

643
00:28:54,705 --> 00:28:56,970
Cross-Reference William Lamontagne

644
00:28:57,005 --> 00:28:58,270
With Jones bar.

645
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,470
Bull's-Eye.

646
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,570
Police blotter...
Answered a disturbance

647
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:05,170
At Jones bar in the french quarter,

648
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:07,770
February 19, 1998.

649
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:09,470
Looks like it was during mardi gras.

650
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,270
You are the best ever.

651
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:13,670
Ohh... and you're the
most perceptive.

652
00:29:17,770 --> 00:29:18,770
Smitty.

653
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:20,770
How are you ?

654
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,470
I hope you got a good reason

655
00:29:23,505 --> 00:29:24,970
Dredging this crap up.

656
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,170
Well, I was hoping

657
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,970
You might remember
being called here

658
00:29:30,005 --> 00:29:31,370
With my daddy 9 years ago.

659
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,770
Is that a joke ?

660
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,170
No.

661
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,570
My name's Jason Gideon.

662
00:29:35,605 --> 00:29:36,570
We're from the FBI.

663
00:29:36,605 --> 00:29:38,370
We're investigating
the series of murders

664
00:29:38,405 --> 00:29:39,270
In the french quarter.

665
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,070
What's that got to do with me ?

666
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,770
We need you to tell us
what happened

667
00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:44,670
The night you and detective
Lamontagne answered the call

668
00:29:44,705 --> 00:29:45,470
In this bar.

669
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:49,870
Am I missing something ?

670
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,670
You really don't know, do you ?

671
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:54,670
After that night, your daddy

672
00:29:54,705 --> 00:29:56,270
Tried to bring me up on sanctions.

673
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,270
Why ?

674
00:29:57,305 --> 00:29:58,170
It was mardi gras.

675
00:29:58,205 --> 00:29:59,770
Some girl claimed she was raped.

676
00:29:59,805 --> 00:30:00,670
In this bar.

677
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,570
I wasn't buying it.

678
00:30:02,605 --> 00:30:04,170
What did she say happened to her ?

679
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,570
Brass backed me up.

680
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,870
They ended up transferring
your daddy out

681
00:30:08,905 --> 00:30:09,770
To shut him up.

682
00:30:09,805 --> 00:30:10,670
What happened here ?

683
00:30:11,370 --> 00:30:12,970
It almost cost me my career.

684
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,270
Do you mind telling us what happened ?

685
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:18,570
My best recollection,

686
00:30:18,605 --> 00:30:20,270
She said she was sitting at the bar

687
00:30:20,305 --> 00:30:21,470
With 2 friends.

688
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:25,370
One of the boys asked her
if she wanted to play some pool.

689
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:30,870
Witnesses claim she was up
for anything.

690
00:30:36,770 --> 00:30:38,070
She followed him up here ?

691
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:40,870
His friend not far behind.

692
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,070
She knew he was there.

693
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,570
That girl was a tease.

694
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:58,570
She was looking for a good time.

695
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,970
Anyway, a couple of guys
were going along with that.

696
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,470
Did she yell for help ?

697
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:06,970
She said she did.

698
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,770
But not a single person
claimed that they heard her.

699
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:18,570
That's what you registered
as a disturbance ?

700
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:21,570
It was mardi gras.

701
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:22,970
Listen to me.

702
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:25,170
That girl had enough beads
hanging from her neck

703
00:31:25,205 --> 00:31:27,070
To jewel a small city.

704
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:30,470
Anyone exposes themselves
that much in one day

705
00:31:30,505 --> 00:31:32,170
Is not a credible witness in my book.

706
00:31:32,205 --> 00:31:34,070
But she wanted to press charges.

707
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:35,870
I told her it was a waste of time.

708
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,670
I knew one of the accused.

709
00:31:37,705 --> 00:31:38,870
He was a good kid.

710
00:31:38,905 --> 00:31:41,570
He didn't need the stink
of that accusation.

711
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:43,970
So you protected a rapist ?

712
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,170
Well, that right there

713
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:49,770
Was a bone of contention
between his daddy and i.

714
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,070
As far as I was concerned,

715
00:31:51,105 --> 00:31:53,070
No such rape ever took place.

716
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:53,970
Are you gonna tell me

717
00:31:54,005 --> 00:31:57,070
Why you went and dragged
this dirt back through my life ?

718
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,270
You know the serial killer

719
00:32:00,305 --> 00:32:02,370
Who's cutting up men
in the french quarter ?

720
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:05,070
She was your victim.

721
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,070
We're trying to find a name.

722
00:32:11,770 --> 00:32:13,370
You don't even remember her name ?

723
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:14,770
It was 9 years ago.

724
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:18,170
What about the name of the
"good kid" who raped her ?

725
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:21,670
Smitty...

726
00:32:23,770 --> 00:32:26,770
You tell me right now or I'll file
a new sanction against you,

727
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,470
And I guarantee you,
this time it'll stick.

728
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:35,970
Mr. Tibideaux, we need you
to answer a few questions

729
00:32:36,005 --> 00:32:39,670
About a disturbance you were
involved with in 1998.

730
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,770
I don't know what you're talking about.

731
00:32:42,805 --> 00:32:44,570
At a bar called Jones.

732
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,570
It was mardi gras.

733
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,770
Well, then,
I must have been drinking some,

734
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,670
'Cause I don't remember a thing.

735
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,170
We just need to know the name...

736
00:32:56,205 --> 00:32:58,270
Look, I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

737
00:32:58,305 --> 00:33:00,270
The statute of limitations is up.

738
00:33:00,305 --> 00:33:02,370
We just need a name.

739
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,870
Someone accuses me of rape,
­

740
00:33:06,470 --> 00:33:08,270
I'm going to remember her name.

741
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:09,970
What can I tell you, cher ?

742
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:12,970
I guess she didn't make
that good of an impression.

743
00:33:13,005 --> 00:33:15,370
Unlike yourself, right now.

744
00:33:15,405 --> 00:33:16,870
You know, I'm guessing if someone

745
00:33:16,905 --> 00:33:19,170
Did do something
to that girl that night,

746
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,470
Then she was probably asking for it.

747
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,870
Maybe even liked it.

748
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:29,070
Guy's not giving up anything.

749
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:31,470
Right after the double murder,

750
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:32,870
What was the ripper's next move ?

751
00:33:32,905 --> 00:33:34,770
He mutilated and
dismembered Mary Kelly

752
00:33:34,805 --> 00:33:37,270
In her one-Room flat until
she was unrecognizable.

753
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:39,270
It's believed to be his most
vicious kill of all.

754
00:33:39,305 --> 00:33:40,770
'Cause he had privacy.

755
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:43,270
And time to torture his victim
before killing her.

756
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,270
Maybe we're not too late.

757
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:55,870
She murdered these men,

758
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,670
And I'm guessing it's only
a matter of time

759
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:01,370
Before she works
her way back to the one

760
00:34:01,405 --> 00:34:02,970
She really wants to kill.

761
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,570
She make an impression now ?

762
00:34:08,770 --> 00:34:09,770
Work me.

763
00:34:09,805 --> 00:34:12,570
We have a name... Sarah Danlin.
I need an address.

764
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,270
1141 Sherman Avenue.

765
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:19,770
It looks like she was
a med student at tulane,

766
00:34:19,805 --> 00:34:20,970
But she dropped out.

767
00:34:21,005 --> 00:34:23,370
Let me guess... February 1998.

768
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,370
Yeah. Thanks.

769
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:27,970
We got her.

770
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,570
I'm John, by the way.

771
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:36,670
John.

772
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:40,970
Take off your clothes.

773
00:35:09,170 --> 00:35:11,570
Sarah Danlin, F.B.I. !
Open the door.

774
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,970
The things I'm gonna do to you.

775
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,370
Me first.

776
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,970
F.B.I. !

777
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,670
Clear. Clear.

778
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:40,970
She's not here.

779
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:43,170
Guys, there are some ripperologists

780
00:35:43,205 --> 00:35:44,370
Who speculate that Mary Kelly

781
00:35:44,405 --> 00:35:45,870
Was actually killed in a flat

782
00:35:45,905 --> 00:35:47,870
That Jack the ripper
rented for the night.

783
00:35:47,905 --> 00:35:49,270
I'm going to have Garcia
check Sarah Danlin's

784
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:51,070
Credit card accounts.
It's a long shot,

785
00:35:51,105 --> 00:35:53,170
But maybe we can trace her room
back to her charge cards.

786
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,170
Aah !

787
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,370
What the hell was that ?

788
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:05,770
Shh.

789
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:06,870
You're crazy.

790
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:12,170
You never did explain those
"things" you could do to me.

791
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:15,570
Souvenirs.

792
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,370
These are from bars
in the french quarter.

793
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:18,770
This is from mon cherie.

794
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,770
She's trolling for victims
in the place where it all began.

795
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,170
She can't move on.

796
00:36:24,205 --> 00:36:25,270
The rape isn't the whole story.

797
00:36:25,305 --> 00:36:27,070
I'll bet there's a history
of sexual abuse

798
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:28,470
That contributes to her rage as well.

799
00:36:28,505 --> 00:36:30,570
It's almost like by taking
on the ripper persona,

800
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,170
She was trying to kill
something within herself.

801
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,870
Yeah, mama, what do you got ?

802
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:37,370
Sarah Danlin's visa was charged

803
00:36:37,405 --> 00:36:38,970
An hour ago at the Royal Ruby Inn.

804
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:41,170
Ah, baby girl, you never
disappoint. Thank you.

805
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:42,870
Royal Ruby Inn.

806
00:36:42,905 --> 00:36:44,270
That's 2 blocks from here.

807
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,370
Let's go

808
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,370
Please !

809
00:36:52,405 --> 00:36:54,070
Please. Please.

810
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,670
I have... I have children.

811
00:36:56,705 --> 00:36:58,970
Stop...
Please.

812
00:36:59,005 --> 00:37:00,570
You asked...

813
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,070
FBI !

814
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:03,970
Drop the knife. Drop the weapon.

815
00:37:04,005 --> 00:37:07,470
He wanted it... and he got it.

816
00:37:07,505 --> 00:37:08,670
Put it down now.

817
00:37:08,705 --> 00:37:10,470
We need an emt tech right away.

818
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,470
What are you waiting for ?

819
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:16,170
Ma'am, we don't want to shoot you.

820
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:19,270
Be such a shame to waste this.

821
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:21,570
Do you want it, too ?

822
00:37:21,605 --> 00:37:23,870
What I want is for you
to put that knife down.

823
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,570
Come on.

824
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:28,070
Don't fight it.

825
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:29,670
Sarah, we don't want to hurt you.

826
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,970
Men.

827
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:38,670
Sarah, my name's
William Lamontagne JR.

828
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,270
You knew my daddy ?

829
00:37:46,070 --> 00:37:47,270
Yeah, yeah.

830
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,170
You trusted him. So trust me.

831
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,170
Where is he ?

832
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:57,570
The storm took him.

833
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:03,670
Come on. It's over.

834
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:12,070
It's over.

835
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:28,870
Hey.

836
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,770
Hey there.

837
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:35,970
The medic says that her
victim's going to be ok.

838
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:41,070
I heard what you did in there.

839
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,670
Your dad would be really proud.

840
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,270
It's weird.

841
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:52,470
I spent all this time focused
on closing this case for him...

842
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:55,170
And now it's over.

843
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,870
Yeah.

844
00:38:58,470 --> 00:39:00,970
I thought I'd feel happy,
but I just feel lost.

845
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,170
Because you've...

846
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:06,970
And now you're leaving ?

847
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:11,670
How will I survive a woman
like you going so far away ?

848
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:17,370
Well, despite what
you may have heard...

849
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:23,170
Cell phones can be very
good for your health.

850
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,470
See ya.

851
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:53,070
How'd you find me ?

852
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,370
You're not all that hard to profile.

853
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:02,270
Your friend is good.

854
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,870
I missed that plane on purpose.

855
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:14,970
I know.

856
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,170
I'm struggling.

857
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:22,970
Well... anybody who's been through

858
00:40:23,005 --> 00:40:24,870
What you've been through recently...

859
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:26,870
Would.

860
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:28,570
This is all I was groomed for.

861
00:40:28,605 --> 00:40:29,470
I never even...

862
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:32,670
I never even considered
another option.

863
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,170
Now you're questioning
whether or not

864
00:40:34,205 --> 00:40:35,870
You're strong enough to be here ?

865
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,170
Yeah.

866
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:41,070
I have been playing at this job

867
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:45,170
In one way or another
for almost 30 years.

868
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:47,970
I've felt lost.

869
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,870
I've felt great.

870
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:54,570
I have felt scared,

871
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:56,570
Sick,

872
00:40:58,370 --> 00:40:59,470
And insane.

873
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,570
I don't know.

874
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:10,370
I guess the day this job stops
gnawing at your soul and...

875
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:17,570
Hands... your hands stop feeling cold...

876
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,670
Maybe that's the time to leave.

877
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:28,770
I guess I just needed
to try to figure out

878
00:41:28,805 --> 00:41:30,970
If I could step away from this job.

879
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:34,070
And ?

880
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,870
I'll never miss another plane again.
