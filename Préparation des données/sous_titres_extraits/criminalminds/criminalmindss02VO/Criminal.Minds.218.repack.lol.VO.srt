00:00:01,325 --> 00:00:02,925
Previously on Criminal Minds...

2
00:00:04,925 --> 00:00:06,625
Please, I don't want it.
I don't want it.

3
00:00:06,625 --> 00:00:07,825
It helps.

4
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:23,725
What is the matter with you ?

5
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,025
What do you mean, what's
the matter with me ?

6
00:00:26,025 --> 00:00:27,625
I have never seen
you act like this.

7
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:29,225
Really ?  Oh, in the months
that you know me,

8
00:00:29,225 --> 00:00:30,325
You've never seen me act this way ?

9
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:31,925
Hey, no offense, Emily, but...

10
00:00:32,225 --> 00:00:34,125
You don't really know what
you're talking about, do you ?

11
00:00:36,025 --> 00:00:38,425
Earlier this morning katrina
crashed into the gulf coast,

12
00:00:38,425 --> 00:00:41,425
With sustained winds
above 125 an hour.

13
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:42,925
As many houses are being destroyed.

14
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,925
Residents are trying to evacuate.

15
00:00:50,225 --> 00:00:51,625
Are you listening to me, pop ?

16
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,425
Grab your wallet and get
the hell out of there.

17
00:00:53,425 --> 00:00:54,525
The buses are filling up.

18
00:00:54,525 --> 00:00:56,225
This case is eatin' at me, Billy.

19
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:57,425
Dad.

20
00:00:57,425 --> 00:00:58,625
Forget the damn case.

21
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:00,325
What the hell am I missing here ?

22
00:01:00,325 --> 00:01:02,025
Dad, people are drowning in their homes.

23
00:01:02,025 --> 00:01:05,325
The... Whole world's
gonna be underwater.

24
00:01:06,125 --> 00:01:07,525
I got another letter, Billy.

25
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,925
Screw the letter.
Forget the serial killer.

26
00:01:09,925 --> 00:01:11,125
They're opening the superdome.

27
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,425
I want you to meet me there.

28
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:14,925
I'll be damned.

29
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,125
... Please, I'm begging you, pop.

30
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:19,925
Pop ?

31
00:01:57,025 --> 00:01:59,325
Behavioral analysis unit

32
00:01:59,325 --> 00:02:01,225
We've got a serial killer
in New Orleans

33
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:03,925
Who killed at least
3 men pre-Katrina.

34
00:02:03,925 --> 00:02:06,025
Until now, the New Orleans
police department

35
00:02:06,025 --> 00:02:08,225
Believed that the serial
killer died in the storm.

36
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:09,825
What's happened to tell
them otherwise ?

37
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:12,825
A fourth body was found in
the french quarter last night.

38
00:02:12,825 --> 00:02:14,525
Same M.O. Another male.

39
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:16,425
Throat slashed, eviscerated.

40
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:18,625
A year and a half ?  That's a
long cooling-Off period.

41
00:02:18,625 --> 00:02:20,225
Are we sure this
is the same unsub ?

42
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,325
He claims to be.

43
00:02:21,325 --> 00:02:23,125
He sent a letter
to William Lamontagne,

44
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:24,825
The head detective on the case.

45
00:02:24,825 --> 00:02:26,325
Does Lamontagne have any leads ?

46
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:28,025
He died in Katrina.

47
00:02:28,525 --> 00:02:30,925
His son is actually
leading the case now.

48
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:32,625
Hmm. That can't be easy.

49
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:34,225
Well, we need to pour over the evidence

50
00:02:34,225 --> 00:02:36,225
From the first 3 murders
and determine the pattern.

51
00:02:36,225 --> 00:02:37,725
Katrina washed everything away.

52
00:02:37,725 --> 00:02:41,325
The 3 victims we know of,
their autopsy reports,

53
00:02:41,325 --> 00:02:42,625
Witness statements.

54
00:02:42,625 --> 00:02:43,725
DNA test results.

55
00:02:43,725 --> 00:02:46,425
So, basically, all we have
to go on is the latest victim ?

56
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:48,025
Yeah.

57
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,525
Until he kills again.

58
00:02:54,025 --> 00:02:56,125
Criminal minds 218

59
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:28,881
Robert Kennedy once said,

60
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:32,581
"Tragedy is a tool for
the living to gain wisdom,

61
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:34,781
Not a guide by which to live."

62
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:38,081
Hey, Reid.

63
00:03:38,881 --> 00:03:40,081
What's goin' on up there ?

64
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,881
From Las Vegas... Ethan.

65
00:03:44,581 --> 00:03:46,281
I'm pretty sure he lives
in New Orleans now.

66
00:03:46,281 --> 00:03:47,981
Really ?  Gonna give him a call ?

67
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:49,581
Grew up competing against each other

68
00:03:49,581 --> 00:03:50,681
In absolutely everything.

69
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:52,581
Spelling bees, science fairs.

70
00:03:52,581 --> 00:03:55,281
We also both had our hearts set
on joining the bureau, but...

71
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:57,981
First day at quantico he backed out.

72
00:03:58,481 --> 00:04:00,281
He probably just couldn't take the heat.

73
00:04:00,981 --> 00:04:02,881
It's not really for us
to judge, is it ?

74
00:04:04,381 --> 00:04:05,181
Right.

75
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:06,981
My bad.

76
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,281
These are copies of the newspaper
articles on the murders,

77
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:12,381
Dating back to early august 2005.

78
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:13,681
It's all we have to go on.

79
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:15,881
He killed 3 times,
he stopped for 18 months,

80
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:17,381
Then he started killing again.

81
00:04:17,381 --> 00:04:18,681
We should have garcia run a list

82
00:04:18,681 --> 00:04:20,481
Of any offenders in the area.

83
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:22,881
Anyone who spent the last year
and a half doing time.

84
00:04:22,881 --> 00:04:25,881
Or anyone that relocated after
Katrina and recently moved back.

85
00:04:25,881 --> 00:04:28,881
What is the victimology
in killing a mechanic,

86
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:30,981
A real estate broker, and a cook,

87
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:33,681
With ages ranging from 22 to 45 ?

88
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:36,881
And this latest is
a 33-Year-Old taxi driver.

89
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,881
They just don't seem to have
very much in common.

90
00:04:38,881 --> 00:04:41,281
Besides being male and walking
the french quarter late at night.

91
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,881
Which is notorious for muggings
off the main drag.

92
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:47,281
Yeah, but this guy isn't
in a rush to flee the scene.

93
00:04:47,381 --> 00:04:49,181
A slaughter like this takes time.

94
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:51,781
Andrei Chikatilo fantasized that
the men he killed were his captives

95
00:04:51,781 --> 00:04:53,581
And then torturing and mutilating them

96
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:54,781
Somehow made him a hero.

97
00:04:54,781 --> 00:04:56,681
The city's barely back to life.

98
00:04:57,181 --> 00:04:59,081
Something like this could
cripple its psyche.

99
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,481
So where do we start ?

100
00:05:00,581 --> 00:05:03,281
Well, with no case file there's
only one place we can start.

101
00:05:04,481 --> 00:05:05,481
At square one.

102
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,081
You must be B.A.U.

103
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:14,981
Bill Lamontagne.

104
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,781
Hi. Jennifer Jareau.
We spoke on the phone.

105
00:05:17,781 --> 00:05:19,081
Well, ok, then.

106
00:05:19,781 --> 00:05:20,981
I pictured you different.

107
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:24,081
Uh, these are agents
Gideon and Morgan.

108
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:26,881
This is detective
William Lamontagne JR.

109
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:28,881
Appreciate you guys being here.

110
00:05:29,381 --> 00:05:31,781
My daddy was too stubborn
to ever ask for any help.

111
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,281
Sorry for your loss.

112
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:36,981
I understand you received a letter.

113
00:05:36,981 --> 00:05:39,081
Yeah. Before they were
lost in Katrina,

114
00:05:39,081 --> 00:05:40,681
My daddy received 2 letters.

115
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:42,681
This one came addressed to him yesterday.

116
00:05:42,681 --> 00:05:44,081
They passed it on to me.

117
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,681
You sure it's from
the same killer ?

118
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,781
It's a detailed account
of what he did to the body.

119
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:53,081
4 layers of fatty tissue
sliced through like butter.

120
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:55,281
I only seen that 3 other times.

121
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:56,481
You work this case initially ?

122
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:58,681
Nah. You don't forget victims like this.

123
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:00,381
It's like they were dissected.

124
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:02,281
I can still smell the alcohol on him.

125
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:03,281
This is New Orleans.

126
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:05,681
Dead or alive,
it' a smell you get used to.

127
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:07,581
The victim has no defense wounds.

128
00:06:07,581 --> 00:06:09,881
Meaning this is most
likely a blitz attack.

129
00:06:13,981 --> 00:06:16,881
No hesitation marks or rapid thrusts.

130
00:06:16,881 --> 00:06:18,281
Cuts were methodical.

131
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:19,581
Almost procedural.

132
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:22,581
My guess... Whoever gutted
this guy was taught to.

133
00:06:22,581 --> 00:06:24,281
So you think he might have
some medical training ?

134
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:26,381
How else could he carve
around every organ

135
00:06:26,381 --> 00:06:27,781
And leave each one intact ?

136
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:30,081
Have any of his relatives
come to claim the body ?

137
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:31,381
Anyone we could speak with ?

138
00:06:31,381 --> 00:06:34,381
No. I'll end up boxing up
the poor bastard's ashes,

139
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,481
Left to collect dust in storage.

140
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:38,981
All the bodies I've been through
in the last year and a half,

141
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:40,681
It's a wonder I still have room.

142
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,781
It'd be pretty easy to hide out
in one of these alcoves,

143
00:06:49,781 --> 00:06:51,781
Wait for the victim
without ever being seen.

144
00:06:52,181 --> 00:06:54,681
Yeah, all 4 murders occurred
within a 10-Block radius

145
00:06:54,681 --> 00:06:56,381
Here inside the french quarter.

146
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:59,081
On any given night, there'd
have to be thousands of people

147
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:00,981
Walking through here from the bars.

148
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:02,281
Tens of thousands.

149
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:03,681
When I first started as a cop,

150
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:04,881
I worked the quarter.

151
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:06,981
It's like being in the riot
squad every night.

152
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,181
Every sunday I'd get off
work around sunrise,

153
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:10,681
I'm ready to pass out,

154
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,581
My daddy'd be waiting
for me at my house.

155
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:14,917
Make me drive him uptown to Frankie
and Johnny's for poorboys.

156
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:18,881
Called it communing with New Orleans.

157
00:07:19,181 --> 00:07:20,880
Did your father tell you anything else
about this case that we should know ?

158
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:23,281
He tried to.

159
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:25,781
But you guys should
see that for yourself.

160
00:07:29,781 --> 00:07:32,781
This wall is still standing
where daddy carved the message

161
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,181
Right before he died.

162
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:40,981
There's no doubt he's still
working from the grave.

163
00:07:44,081 --> 00:07:46,381
"Jones." That name mean
anything to you ?

164
00:07:46,481 --> 00:07:48,081
No. I ran it through the database

165
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,781
Against every offender
in New Orleans.

166
00:07:49,781 --> 00:07:51,881
And you can imagine
how many hits I got.

167
00:07:51,881 --> 00:07:54,381
But nothing came up
in connection with this case.

168
00:07:54,681 --> 00:07:56,181
But in your dad's final moments,

169
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:58,781
It was the most important
thing he wanted to say.

170
00:07:59,881 --> 00:08:01,981
Learned how to play
the drums in this house,

171
00:08:02,881 --> 00:08:04,981
Grew up with 2 dogs in this house.

172
00:08:05,881 --> 00:08:08,781
All it's gonna be now is the word
"jones" carved into that wall.

173
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:10,981
Detective, if he had
written the unsub's name,

174
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:12,781
I think you would have
found him by now.

175
00:08:13,381 --> 00:08:14,481
Jones is the one
piece of the puzzle

176
00:08:14,481 --> 00:08:15,881
That your daddy did know.

177
00:08:16,381 --> 00:08:17,881
He trusted you to figure out the rest.

178
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:19,181
Yeah, I know it.

179
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,981
But I've pored over
it a thousand times

180
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:22,681
And I still can't put it together.

181
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:26,381
I can't get it out of my head.

182
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:31,581
You ok ?

183
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:33,681
Yeah.

184
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,181
I just don't want to disappoint him.

185
00:08:41,681 --> 00:08:43,081
Is that the letter from the unsub ?

186
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:43,881
Yeah.

187
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,281
I'm back with a vengeance.

188
00:08:45,281 --> 00:08:46,481
I wanted you to know.

189
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:49,081
The last guy made it easy,
being out so late,

190
00:08:49,081 --> 00:08:50,181
Stumbling home drunk.

191
00:08:50,181 --> 00:08:52,081
I enjoyed slicing around his organs.

192
00:08:52,081 --> 00:08:53,881
I thought about sending you one.

193
00:08:53,981 --> 00:08:56,781
He was asking to be ripped,
don't you think, boss ?

194
00:08:56,781 --> 00:08:57,581
Yours truly."

195
00:08:57,581 --> 00:08:58,381
Hey.

196
00:09:00,881 --> 00:09:01,681
Ok.

197
00:09:03,181 --> 00:09:05,181
To say that the victims
were asking to be killed

198
00:09:05,181 --> 00:09:06,381
Denies all culpability.

199
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,381
Most sexual sadists rationalize
their own behavior

200
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,681
By blaming the victims like that.

201
00:09:09,681 --> 00:09:12,281
But there was no evidence
of sexual assault in the autopsy.

202
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:14,981
He could be a homosexual male

203
00:09:14,981 --> 00:09:17,281
Stabbing because he needs
violence for arousal.

204
00:09:17,681 --> 00:09:20,081
Every kill he's acting
out a fantasy of revenge.

205
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,381
What if he's trying to act
out something else ?  Like what ?

206
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:26,281
Except for the victims were men,
it's the same M.O.

207
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,281
What are you talking about ?

208
00:09:27,681 --> 00:09:30,581
All 4 victims were found with
their throats slashed, eviscerated,

209
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:33,081
And the murders perpetrated
in semi-Public places after dark.

210
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:35,281
Investigators taunted with
the letters addressed to "boss."

211
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:38,281
The only difference is that
case was 100 years ago

212
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,381
And the murders took place in London.

213
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:41,881
Jack the ripper.

214
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,981
The unsub wants us to think

215
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:46,381
That he's the modern-Day version
loose in New Orleans.

216
00:09:47,581 --> 00:09:48,881
Please.Don't

217
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,389
So the 3 of you were out
together last night ?

218
00:10:05,989 --> 00:10:08,089
Mark had just paid his tab at one bar

219
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:09,589
And he was on his way
to meet us at another.

220
00:10:09,589 --> 00:10:10,689
You guys get in any trouble ?

221
00:10:11,089 --> 00:10:12,789
Drunken brawl ?
Anyone get out of hand ?

222
00:10:12,989 --> 00:10:14,989
We were just out
to have fun, you know ?

223
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:16,589
Minded our own business.

224
00:10:16,589 --> 00:10:17,689
Could mark have met a girl ?

225
00:10:18,089 --> 00:10:19,289
Maybe upset her boyfriend ?

226
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:20,289
No, sir.

227
00:10:20,689 --> 00:10:22,489
He struck out like we all did.

228
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:23,989
Thanks, guys.

229
00:10:23,989 --> 00:10:24,789
Ok.

230
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:29,689
Getting hard to keep up
with this guy.

231
00:10:30,389 --> 00:10:32,589
Well, if he's mimicking
Jack the ripper,

232
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:34,189
That might be precisely the point.

233
00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:36,389
He terrorized london for months

234
00:10:36,389 --> 00:10:37,389
Without ever getting caught.

235
00:10:37,989 --> 00:10:39,789
I'd appreciate it
if you'd gather your men.

236
00:10:39,989 --> 00:10:42,189
We'd like to give you a profile
of who you're up against.

237
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,289
The offender we're looking
for is friendly,

238
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:48,189
Agile, somewhere between 30 and 35.

239
00:10:48,489 --> 00:10:49,989
He'll allure with charm

240
00:10:50,489 --> 00:10:51,689
And kill with rage.

241
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:53,489
We believe he's murdering men

242
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,089
To reclaim his power.

243
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:57,389
This unsub suffers
from low self-Esteem,

244
00:10:57,389 --> 00:10:58,889
But he probably covers it well.

245
00:10:59,189 --> 00:11:01,489
He dresses impeccably
to feed the facade.

246
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:02,989
Jack the ripper himself

247
00:11:02,989 --> 00:11:04,789
Was an impetuous lust murderer,

248
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,489
Whereas this offender is organized,

249
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:09,989
Calculating.

250
00:11:10,089 --> 00:11:12,189
He might even stalk
his victims for days

251
00:11:12,189 --> 00:11:13,489
Before the actual kill.

252
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:19,889
We believe this killer identifies
with Jack the ripper

253
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:21,589
Because he's lost his own identity.

254
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:24,789
Maybe through years
of child abuse...

255
00:11:25,689 --> 00:11:27,689
Or some catastrophic event.

256
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:31,289
Because he overcompensates
to hide his insecurities,

257
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,789
We believe he may hold a position
of authority at work.

258
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:36,389
And since we think he's had
medical training,

259
00:11:36,389 --> 00:11:40,089
Consider emts, doctors, veterinarians.

260
00:11:40,289 --> 00:11:41,389
Please be careful.

261
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:42,389
For this unsub,

262
00:11:42,389 --> 00:11:44,089
The french quarter's
a hunting ground.

263
00:11:44,989 --> 00:11:47,189
He's certainly already proven
he knows the terrain.

264
00:12:05,589 --> 00:12:06,789
Jeez !

265
00:12:07,489 --> 00:12:08,889
Reid, you scared me.

266
00:12:08,889 --> 00:12:10,589
Always been one step
ahead of you, man.

267
00:12:10,789 --> 00:12:12,689
Yeah, whatever helps
you sleep at night.

268
00:12:14,089 --> 00:12:15,989
I'm glad you called.
It's good to see you.

269
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:17,489
You, too.

270
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:19,489
Let's get a drink.

271
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:24,189
Prentiss.

272
00:12:24,189 --> 00:12:25,189
What was the thing

273
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:27,289
Jack the ripper took from
one of his victims ?

274
00:12:27,489 --> 00:12:29,489
Besides, well, you know, her life ?

275
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:30,889
Oh. Uh... Uh...

276
00:12:31,189 --> 00:12:31,989
Mmm.

277
00:12:32,389 --> 00:12:33,889
Tick tock...

278
00:12:34,089 --> 00:12:35,889
Tick tock.

279
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:37,789
I don't know.

280
00:12:38,489 --> 00:12:39,489
A kidney.

281
00:12:39,889 --> 00:12:42,189
How horrify ingly
fantastic is that ?

282
00:12:42,189 --> 00:12:44,789
Mm-Hmm. And are you
going anywhere with this ?

283
00:12:44,789 --> 00:12:48,089
Just that I found an unsolved murder
that happened 4 months ago

284
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:49,489
In Galveston, Texas,

285
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:50,789
With the same M.O.,

286
00:12:50,789 --> 00:12:51,789
The victim missing

287
00:12:51,789 --> 00:12:53,689
That very organ.

288
00:12:55,789 --> 00:12:57,089
I amaze myself.

289
00:12:57,089 --> 00:12:59,389
Yeah. Me, too.

290
00:12:59,389 --> 00:13:00,289
Great work.

291
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:01,989
What's that ?

292
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,489
Garcia found a similar
case in Galveston, Texas.

293
00:13:04,789 --> 00:13:06,889
A lot of Katrina refugees
relocated there.

294
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:07,889
It could be the same guy.

295
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,089
He removed the kidney
just like Jack the ripper.

296
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,289
Call Reid and Morgan.

297
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:13,489
I want the 3 of you on a plane
to Texas tonight.

298
00:13:13,489 --> 00:13:14,289
Ok.

299
00:13:23,989 --> 00:13:24,889
So...

300
00:13:25,589 --> 00:13:26,989
Are you gonna ask the question ?

301
00:13:28,289 --> 00:13:29,089
What question ?

302
00:13:29,089 --> 00:13:30,089
Come on, man.

303
00:13:30,489 --> 00:13:31,689
It's me here.

304
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:33,789
We haven't talked
to each other in years.

305
00:13:33,789 --> 00:13:35,089
I know it's why you called me.

306
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:36,189
Ask the question.

307
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:40,589
Why did you quit after only
one day of fbi training ?

308
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:43,589
Well...

309
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:48,189
I'm sure you've
considered the evidence,

310
00:13:49,489 --> 00:13:51,289
Analyzed the signs.

311
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:55,389
You were battling what's
your own demons.

312
00:13:55,389 --> 00:13:57,289
You didn't have time
to analyze someone else's.

313
00:13:58,189 --> 00:13:59,689
Not bad. Not bad.

314
00:13:59,989 --> 00:14:03,289
Those days, I did prefer
Jack Daniel's to Jeff Dahmer.

315
00:14:04,389 --> 00:14:06,589
They both weigh on
your soul eventually.

316
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:09,589
Sorry

317
00:14:13,489 --> 00:14:15,089
The bat phone.

318
00:14:17,989 --> 00:14:19,089
Let me ask you this, Ethan.

319
00:14:19,989 --> 00:14:21,189
Do you ever regret it ?

320
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,089
You know, I may not be
changing the world, but...

321
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,889
My music makes me happy.

322
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:30,589
It doesn't take a profiler
to see that you're not.

323
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:36,489
It's not easy. And it's not...

324
00:14:36,689 --> 00:14:39,289
I... don't think you'd believe some of
the things that I've seen.

325
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:42,689
John Coltrane.

326
00:14:43,389 --> 00:14:44,689
He was a genius, too.

327
00:14:44,689 --> 00:14:45,889
Died of cancer.

328
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:48,889
But most people think
it was the booze and heroin

329
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:49,789
That did him in.

330
00:14:50,089 --> 00:14:51,289
What are you tryingsay ?

331
00:14:51,789 --> 00:14:52,889
You look like hell.

332
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:55,689
I'm fine.

333
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:56,589
Come on, man.

334
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:58,489
I'm a jazz musician
in New Orleans.

335
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:01,089
I know what it looks like
when someone's not well.

336
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:04,489
This may be the one time
I can tell you something

337
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:06,089
That you don't already know.

338
00:15:07,589 --> 00:15:08,989
That might help you forget,

339
00:15:09,289 --> 00:15:10,689
But it won't make it go away.

340
00:15:11,089 --> 00:15:12,089
And if I can tell...

341
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:16,389
You're surrounded by some of
the best minds in the world,

342
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:18,889
And if you think they don't notice...

343
00:15:20,189 --> 00:15:20,989
Well...

344
00:15:21,689 --> 00:15:22,989
For a genius,

345
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,489
That's just dumb.

346
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:33,089
Hey. Hey.

347
00:15:36,689 --> 00:15:37,489
Where's Reid ?

348
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:40,189
I was hoping he was with you.

349
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,289
I thought you said you called him.

350
00:15:41,289 --> 00:15:43,089
I did, 4 times. Nothing.

351
00:15:45,589 --> 00:15:47,689
The victim's fiancee is expecting us.

352
00:15:48,189 --> 00:15:49,189
What are we supposed to do ?

353
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:53,789
We got one option.

354
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,289
Wheels up.

355
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:01,189
Thank you.

356
00:16:01,689 --> 00:16:02,689
It's not right.

357
00:16:03,289 --> 00:16:06,289
The french quarter's one of the only
parts of the city that dodged Katrina.

358
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:08,289
Now there's a serial killer loose.

359
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:09,589
It's a small area,

360
00:16:09,589 --> 00:16:11,189
And we're narrowing down the profile.

361
00:16:11,989 --> 00:16:12,889
We'll find him.

362
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:18,489
You always drink while
you're still on the clock ?

363
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,189
This is New Orleans, honey.

364
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:21,889
It's a cultural thing.

365
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:23,589
Where are you from ?

366
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:26,289
Pennsylvania.

367
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:28,489
I take it the folks

368
00:16:29,189 --> 00:16:31,589
Are a little rigid about
the rules up that way.

369
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:35,689
Well, if it makes you feel better...

370
00:16:37,889 --> 00:16:39,689
We'll play it
Pennsylvania style tonight.

371
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:45,089
I just hate that this guy
has a leg up on us, you know ?

372
00:16:45,389 --> 00:16:49,389
I promise, as soon as my team
knows anything, we'll hear.

373
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:50,289
Ok ?

374
00:16:52,789 --> 00:16:54,189
Why aren't you married ?

375
00:16:57,989 --> 00:17:01,189
Uh, that involves this case how ?

376
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:02,289
It doesn't.

377
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,189
I'm just flirtin'.

378
00:17:06,189 --> 00:17:07,489
It's unprofessional.

379
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:09,289
You don't have to answer that.

380
00:17:09,489 --> 00:17:10,489
Excuse me.

381
00:17:10,889 --> 00:17:12,689
Compliments of the woman
in the blue top.

382
00:17:18,689 --> 00:17:20,689
Wow. That was... bold.

383
00:17:21,489 --> 00:17:23,389
She might have thought
we were just working.

384
00:17:25,289 --> 00:17:26,389
We are.

385
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:28,789
Are you jealous ?

386
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:32,389
No. I just... I...

387
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:34,989
I'm surprised, that's all.

388
00:17:34,989 --> 00:17:36,489
And you're a lousy liar, too.

389
00:17:37,989 --> 00:17:39,789
You haven't had much practice, huh ?

390
00:17:40,789 --> 00:17:42,789
It's a culture thing.

391
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:44,489
You see.

392
00:17:45,889 --> 00:17:46,789
There you go.

393
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:49,089
Everybody kept sayg

394
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:51,389
Crime's gonna skyrocket
after the relocation.

395
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,289
You just never think
it's gonna happen to you.

396
00:17:56,289 --> 00:17:58,489
The report said that your fiance

397
00:17:58,489 --> 00:18:00,589
Was bar-Hopping for his bachelor party

398
00:18:00,589 --> 00:18:02,389
On the night he was killed.

399
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:05,889
We were supposed
to be married in october.

400
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,989
He was just out
celebrating that with friends.

401
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,489
Was there anyone at Leonard's
bachelor party

402
00:18:12,489 --> 00:18:13,389
You didn't know ?

403
00:18:14,989 --> 00:18:16,289
We all grew up together.

404
00:18:16,689 --> 00:18:18,089
They're like family to me.

405
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:20,689
Whether they met
somebody out, you know,

406
00:18:20,689 --> 00:18:21,589
That's a different story.

407
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:24,689
They're a rowdy bunch.

408
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:27,389
And they'd party with anybody.

409
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:33,889
Each of the last 2 victims
was traveling in a group.

410
00:18:34,089 --> 00:18:36,889
Both were drinking, both
in public arenas, bar-Hopping.

411
00:18:36,889 --> 00:18:39,289
So how could their friends
not see anything ?

412
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,789
It like when a lion preys
upon an antelope.

413
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:45,689
You lost me.

414
00:18:47,989 --> 00:18:49,289
That's because you,
Emily Prentiss,

415
00:18:49,289 --> 00:18:50,689
Have never been
one of the antelope.

416
00:18:51,589 --> 00:18:53,289
Oh, scratch that.
You totally lost me.

417
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:55,189
Ok. Check this out.

418
00:18:56,389 --> 00:18:57,989
The antelope travel in packs.

419
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:00,889
So the lion just sits and waits.

420
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:03,389
Waits for just one of the antelope

421
00:19:03,389 --> 00:19:04,689
To break away from its herd.

422
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:06,789
So when he's alone,

423
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,189
Vulnerable, and completely unprotected,

424
00:19:09,989 --> 00:19:10,989
That's when the lion strikes.

425
00:19:10,989 --> 00:19:12,389
That's when she makes her move.

426
00:19:12,589 --> 00:19:14,189
Wait a minute. Her move ?

427
00:19:14,189 --> 00:19:15,889
Prentiss, there's only one thing

428
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:16,789
That's gonna make a straight man

429
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,189
Leave his friends on guys night out.

430
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:20,889
And it'll make him leave every time.

431
00:19:24,189 --> 00:19:26,089
One of the victims was out
for his bachelor party.

432
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:28,889
Another one out with just the guys.

433
00:19:29,389 --> 00:19:30,289
What's the only temptation

434
00:19:30,289 --> 00:19:32,789
That's gonna lure these men
away from each other ?  A woman.

435
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:35,189
J.J.

436
00:19:37,889 --> 00:19:38,789
Ok.

437
00:19:39,489 --> 00:19:40,689
Yeah, he's right here with me.

438
00:19:42,989 --> 00:19:43,789
Thanks.

439
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:46,089
What's going on ?

440
00:19:46,089 --> 00:19:48,189
The ansub...

441
00:19:57,964 --> 00:19:58,764
Hey.

442
00:20:03,564 --> 00:20:06,064
We're not making a media
spectacle out of this.

443
00:20:06,264 --> 00:20:08,064
People need to know that
this killer is a woman.

444
00:20:10,464 --> 00:20:11,264
What ?

445
00:20:12,064 --> 00:20:13,064
Listen.

446
00:20:13,664 --> 00:20:15,564
Tourists are just starting
to filter back here.

447
00:20:16,064 --> 00:20:17,064
That's not the issue.

448
00:20:17,064 --> 00:20:20,164
I can't create mass hysteria
in a city trying to rebuild.

449
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:22,664
Besides, we'll be playing
right into her hands.

450
00:20:22,664 --> 00:20:23,664
So be it.

451
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:26,364
Look, um...

452
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:28,864
I'm trying not to go
above your head here.

453
00:20:30,264 --> 00:20:31,164
Yeah.

454
00:20:32,664 --> 00:20:33,664
I got that.

455
00:20:33,664 --> 00:20:35,164
Then set up the press conference.

456
00:20:38,564 --> 00:20:40,164
Hey, you guys are
back from Galveston ?

457
00:20:40,564 --> 00:20:41,964
First light this
morning. Where were you ?

458
00:20:42,164 --> 00:20:43,864
I was out with a friend.
I already told you.

459
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:45,664
I called you 4 times.

460
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:47,464
I didn't have any cell
phone reception,

461
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:48,764
So I didn't get your
message until late.

462
00:20:50,364 --> 00:20:51,164
Right.

463
00:20:51,964 --> 00:20:52,764
What's going on ?

464
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:55,564
Our unsub's a woman.

465
00:20:57,564 --> 00:20:59,364
We just found another
body in the quarter.

466
00:21:01,164 --> 00:21:02,364
Throat's been cut.

467
00:21:03,064 --> 00:21:04,264
He's been disemboweled, too.

468
00:21:07,564 --> 00:21:08,764
Reeks of booze.

469
00:21:09,264 --> 00:21:10,364
It's more than a pattern.

470
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:12,664
Only this time he cut
off the earlobe.

471
00:21:12,664 --> 00:21:14,564
She's sticking with
the ripper's paradigm.

472
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:15,764
What do you mean ?

473
00:21:16,464 --> 00:21:17,664
In one letter
of correspondence,

474
00:21:17,664 --> 00:21:19,764
Jack the ripper promised
to cut the earlobe off

475
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:20,764
Of his next victim.

476
00:21:21,364 --> 00:21:22,164
He did.

477
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:24,064
It was the one day
that he killed twice.

478
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:27,064
So she's gonna kill again
by the end of the day.

479
00:21:27,064 --> 00:21:29,464
Ok, what do we know about
female serial killers ?

480
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,864
Basically, you have 2 types.

481
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:33,164
The sante kimes model.

482
00:21:33,164 --> 00:21:34,464
Cold, calculating.

483
00:21:34,864 --> 00:21:35,864
Preys on men for money.

484
00:21:35,864 --> 00:21:37,464
Takes her time building
relationships.

485
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,464
It's more likely
we're dealing with

486
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:39,964
The aileen wuornos archetype,

487
00:21:39,964 --> 00:21:41,564
Motivated by paranoia and fear,

488
00:21:41,564 --> 00:21:42,764
Luring men with sex.

489
00:21:42,964 --> 00:21:45,364
Our unsub's organized.
She follows a routine.

490
00:21:45,364 --> 00:21:48,164
She meets men in a bar,
flirts with them over drinks,

491
00:21:49,564 --> 00:21:52,464
And suggests that they consummate
the evening in an alley.

492
00:21:53,164 --> 00:21:54,364
We need to be in those streets.

493
00:21:55,464 --> 00:21:56,964
Office just brought me this.

494
00:21:58,764 --> 00:21:59,864
Dear boss,

495
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:02,664
By now I have rid the
world of one more.

496
00:22:03,064 --> 00:22:05,264
So many men, so little time.

497
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:07,364
I hope you don't mind the mess.

498
00:22:07,664 --> 00:22:08,964
They make is so easy,

499
00:22:08,964 --> 00:22:10,664
I just can't help myself.

500
00:22:10,964 --> 00:22:12,164
Yours truly.

501
00:22:18,864 --> 00:22:21,464
So were looking for a woman
who will approach men,

502
00:22:22,564 --> 00:22:24,564
Comfortable being
the aggressor, no ?

503
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:27,564
And I'm guessing she'd have
to be quite attractive

504
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:29,064
In order to lure them away.

505
00:22:33,764 --> 00:22:35,064
Most of the women are out in groups,

506
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:36,564
So keep your eyes open
for someone on their own.

507
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:42,664
"So many men, so little time."

508
00:22:43,764 --> 00:22:45,164
So she's on a quest...

509
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:47,164
To wipe out the race.

510
00:22:48,464 --> 00:22:50,864
Or... the father
who molested her ?

511
00:22:51,564 --> 00:22:53,764
Some people think Jack
the ripper mutilated women

512
00:22:53,764 --> 00:22:56,464
After his mother sexually
abused him for years.

513
00:22:57,364 --> 00:22:59,364
For someone so enraged...

514
00:23:00,564 --> 00:23:02,764
This unsub sounds oddly apologetic

515
00:23:02,764 --> 00:23:04,564
For leaving a bloody crime scene.

516
00:23:05,964 --> 00:23:06,764
Why ?

517
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:10,364
That might be what
Lamontagne figured out

518
00:23:10,364 --> 00:23:11,564
Right before he died.

519
00:23:12,564 --> 00:23:15,564
You gotta admit, these guys
are making it pretty easy.

520
00:23:15,564 --> 00:23:17,464
I wouldn't follow
a stranger into an alley

521
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:18,864
No matter how wasted I was.

522
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:19,964
Yeah, but you're not a man.

523
00:23:20,164 --> 00:23:22,264
Testosterone will follow
a woman to Thailand.

524
00:23:22,264 --> 00:23:23,164
Barefoot.

525
00:23:23,564 --> 00:23:24,764
It's just a fact.

526
00:23:30,764 --> 00:23:32,264
Did you give that newest
letter to Reid ?

527
00:23:33,564 --> 00:23:35,564
He knows that ripper case inside out.

528
00:23:36,564 --> 00:23:38,164
He might see something I'm missing.

529
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:39,264
I don't think, uh...

530
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:40,564
What is it ?

531
00:23:41,564 --> 00:23:42,464
Nothing.

532
00:23:43,364 --> 00:23:44,264
Come on.

533
00:23:44,764 --> 00:23:46,664
You think I'm not aware
something's going on with him ?

534
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,664
You gonna tell me why you missed
that flight to Galveston ?

535
00:23:55,464 --> 00:23:56,464
I already told you.

536
00:23:56,464 --> 00:23:57,864
It was no cell reception.

537
00:23:59,364 --> 00:24:00,164
Right.

538
00:24:01,964 --> 00:24:02,764
What ?

539
00:24:02,764 --> 00:24:03,764
I mean, anytime
you want to come up

540
00:24:03,764 --> 00:24:05,164
With a better answer,
I'm standing right here.

541
00:24:09,664 --> 00:24:11,064
Dark Curls, 3 o'clock.

542
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,064
I got it.

543
00:24:15,964 --> 00:24:17,664
She's eyeing those guys
outside that bar.

544
00:24:22,764 --> 00:24:23,564
Let's go.

545
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,664
Oh !  Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

546
00:24:32,964 --> 00:24:33,964
I hate it when that happens.

547
00:24:33,964 --> 00:24:35,164
You all right ?

548
00:24:35,364 --> 00:24:36,664
What can I do to say I'm sorry ?

549
00:24:38,764 --> 00:24:39,864
How about a drink ?

550
00:24:41,464 --> 00:24:42,964
Have a drink. That's cool.

551
00:24:42,964 --> 00:24:44,064
That's cool.

552
00:24:45,664 --> 00:24:46,364
Sure.

553
00:24:46,364 --> 00:24:48,064
Yeah, that's totally fine.

554
00:24:48,564 --> 00:24:51,064
Yeah...

555
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:52,364
Yeah.

556
00:24:52,464 --> 00:24:53,364
Danny.

557
00:24:53,764 --> 00:24:55,264
You fool.

558
00:24:56,464 --> 00:24:58,064
You dropped your wallet out there.

559
00:24:58,964 --> 00:24:59,764
Thanks.

560
00:25:00,064 --> 00:25:01,264
Next drink is on me.

561
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:06,764
So...

562
00:25:07,664 --> 00:25:09,164
Where are your friends tonight ?

563
00:25:10,864 --> 00:25:12,164
I didn't bring any.

564
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:14,364
They get in the way.

565
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:16,864
Now, see, I like that.

566
00:25:17,764 --> 00:25:19,564
'Cause, uh, most girls,

567
00:25:20,164 --> 00:25:21,664
They won't go nowhere alone.

568
00:25:25,764 --> 00:25:28,064
I'm not most girls.

569
00:25:39,964 --> 00:25:40,964
We got nothin'.

570
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:42,464
Well, the day's almost over,

571
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:43,964
So if you're right,
we just ran out of time.

572
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:53,964
Your hair's wet.

573
00:26:01,164 --> 00:26:02,864
Oh, my god !  Aah !

574
00:26:09,488 --> 00:26:10,488
She's mocking us.

575
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:13,888
And she's true to her word.

576
00:26:16,388 --> 00:26:18,288
Do you have any tweezers ?

577
00:26:18,488 --> 00:26:19,288
Thank you.

578
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:23,188
What is that ?

579
00:26:23,188 --> 00:26:24,388
I have no idea.

580
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:30,888
It's a note from the unsub,

581
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:32,388
Addressed to your father.

582
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:33,188
Let's see it.

583
00:26:34,988 --> 00:26:36,088
Dear boss,

584
00:26:36,088 --> 00:26:36,988
He wanted it,

585
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:39,088
With that sharp tongue
and vulgar hand.

586
00:26:39,388 --> 00:26:40,688
Thought you'd like to know

587
00:26:40,688 --> 00:26:43,188
Another will soon
get what he deserves.

588
00:26:43,188 --> 00:26:44,388
Yours truly.

589
00:26:44,588 --> 00:26:47,888
It's weird. Typically, offenders
write letters to be heard.

590
00:26:48,388 --> 00:26:49,988
Jack the ripper bragged
about not being caught.

591
00:26:49,988 --> 00:26:51,488
This unsub isn't
using correspondence

592
00:26:51,488 --> 00:26:52,988
To flaunt her latest kill,

593
00:26:52,988 --> 00:26:54,988
Only to explain why she did it.

594
00:26:55,088 --> 00:26:57,988
It's possible she considers
herself a vigilante.

595
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:01,088
That the men she's killing
deserve to die.

596
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:03,288
Or maybe she's contacting your father,

597
00:27:03,488 --> 00:27:05,288
Not because he was the lead detective

598
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:06,288
On the case, but...

599
00:27:08,288 --> 00:27:09,688
Because she believes he'd understand.

600
00:27:09,988 --> 00:27:11,488
You think he knew her somehow ?

601
00:27:12,188 --> 00:27:14,188
Can you think of a woman
in your dad's life

602
00:27:14,188 --> 00:27:16,088
He helped through a tough time ?

603
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:18,088
Might be another police officer,

604
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:20,588
I don't know, a prostitute
he helped get off the street ?

605
00:27:20,788 --> 00:27:22,388
He hasn't dealt with prostitutes

606
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:24,388
Since he worked sex crimes.

607
00:27:24,388 --> 00:27:27,788
The unsub wrote,
"he was asking to be ripped."

608
00:27:27,788 --> 00:27:30,488
"I just couldn't help
myself," and he wanted it."

609
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:33,588
What if she's mirroring
the man who raped her ?

610
00:27:34,588 --> 00:27:36,888
Where are the files stored
from your sex crime division ?

611
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:38,588
They were housed the same
place as homicide.

612
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:40,188
Most of them were washed away.

613
00:27:40,588 --> 00:27:41,888
Did your dad have a partner ?

614
00:27:41,988 --> 00:27:43,388
Yeah. J.R. Smith.

615
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,488
Smitty, they called him.

616
00:27:45,688 --> 00:27:46,988
He might remember something.

617
00:27:47,388 --> 00:27:49,188
Yeah, but they had a falling out.

618
00:27:49,388 --> 00:27:50,188
What about ?

619
00:27:50,188 --> 00:27:53,188
I don't know. They stopped
talking when he left sex crimes.

620
00:27:57,688 --> 00:27:59,088
Do you have a problem calling him ?

621
00:27:59,788 --> 00:28:01,488
Not if it means breaking this case.

622
00:28:05,988 --> 00:28:07,888
May I borrow your hand for a minute ?

623
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:17,188
I'll be damned.

624
00:28:17,188 --> 00:28:17,988
What is it ?

625
00:28:17,988 --> 00:28:19,588
The stamp on the victim's hand...

626
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:21,788
It's admittance into the mon cherie.

627
00:28:21,788 --> 00:28:23,188
It's a bar in the french quarter.

628
00:28:23,188 --> 00:28:23,988
Oh, yeah ?

629
00:28:23,988 --> 00:28:24,788
Yeah.

630
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:27,888
9 years ago it was called Jones.

631
00:28:30,788 --> 00:28:31,588
Bingo.

632
00:28:32,488 --> 00:28:33,688
Get Garcia on the horn.

633
00:28:36,988 --> 00:28:38,588
O captain, my captain.

634
00:28:38,588 --> 00:28:39,588
I need you.

635
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:40,988
Anything. Talk to me.

636
00:28:40,988 --> 00:28:42,488
Is there any newspaper reports

637
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,988
About a rape at a bar called Jones ?

638
00:28:47,888 --> 00:28:48,788
Zilch.

639
00:28:48,788 --> 00:28:50,088
You sure ?  It would have beenav

640
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:51,088
About 9 years ago.

641
00:28:51,888 --> 00:28:52,688
Nada.

642
00:28:53,488 --> 00:28:54,688
Ok. Uh...

643
00:28:54,688 --> 00:28:56,988
Cross-Reference William Lamontagne

644
00:28:56,988 --> 00:28:58,288
With Jones bar.

645
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:01,488
Bull's-Eye.

646
00:29:01,688 --> 00:29:03,588
Police blotter...
Answered a disturbance

647
00:29:03,588 --> 00:29:05,188
At Jones bar in the french quarter,

648
00:29:05,188 --> 00:29:07,788
February 19, 1998.

649
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,488
Looks like it was during mardi gras.

650
00:29:09,988 --> 00:29:11,288
You are the best ever.

651
00:29:11,488 --> 00:29:13,688
Ohh... and you're the
most perceptive.

652
00:29:17,788 --> 00:29:18,788
Smitty.

653
00:29:19,988 --> 00:29:20,788
How are you ?

654
00:29:21,888 --> 00:29:23,488
I hope you got a good reason

655
00:29:23,488 --> 00:29:24,988
Dredging this crap up.

656
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:28,188
Well, I was hoping

657
00:29:28,488 --> 00:29:29,988
You might remember
being called here

658
00:29:29,988 --> 00:29:31,388
With my daddy 9 years ago.

659
00:29:31,788 --> 00:29:32,788
Is that a joke ?

660
00:29:33,388 --> 00:29:34,188
No.

661
00:29:34,488 --> 00:29:35,588
My name's Jason Gideon.

662
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:36,588
We're from the FBI.

663
00:29:36,588 --> 00:29:38,388
We're investigating
the series of murders

664
00:29:38,388 --> 00:29:39,288
In the french quarter.

665
00:29:39,888 --> 00:29:41,088
What's that got to do with me ?

666
00:29:41,388 --> 00:29:42,788
We need you to tell us
what happened

667
00:29:42,788 --> 00:29:44,688
The night you and detective
Lamontagne answered the call

668
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:45,488
In this bar.

669
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:49,888
Am I missing something ?

670
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,688
You really don't know, do you ?

671
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:54,688
After that night, your daddy

672
00:29:54,688 --> 00:29:56,288
Tried to bring me up on sanctions.

673
00:29:56,488 --> 00:29:57,288
Why ?

674
00:29:57,288 --> 00:29:58,188
It was mardi gras.

675
00:29:58,188 --> 00:29:59,788
Some girl claimed she was raped.

676
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:00,688
In this bar.

677
00:30:01,488 --> 00:30:02,588
I wasn't buying it.

678
00:30:02,588 --> 00:30:04,188
What did she say happened to her ?

679
00:30:05,288 --> 00:30:06,588
Brass backed me up.

680
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:08,888
They ended up transferring
your daddy out

681
00:30:08,888 --> 00:30:09,788
To shut him up.

682
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:10,688
What happened here ?

683
00:30:11,388 --> 00:30:12,988
It almost cost me my career.

684
00:30:14,388 --> 00:30:16,288
Do you mind telling us what happened ?

685
00:30:17,388 --> 00:30:18,588
My best recollection,

686
00:30:18,588 --> 00:30:20,288
She said she was sitting at the bar

687
00:30:20,288 --> 00:30:21,488
With 2 friends.

688
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:25,388
One of the boys asked her
if she wanted to play some pool.

689
00:30:28,488 --> 00:30:30,888
Witnesses claim she was up
for anything.

690
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:38,088
She followed him up here ?

691
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,888
His friend not far behind.

692
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,088
She knew he was there.

693
00:30:55,088 --> 00:30:56,588
That girl was a tease.

694
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,588
She was looking for a good time.

695
00:30:59,388 --> 00:31:01,988
Anyway, a couple of guys
were going along with that.

696
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:05,488
Did she yell for help ?

697
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:06,988
She said she did.

698
00:31:07,088 --> 00:31:09,788
But not a single person
claimed that they heard her.

699
00:31:16,088 --> 00:31:18,588
That's what you registered
as a disturbance ?

700
00:31:19,688 --> 00:31:21,588
It was mardi gras.

701
00:31:22,188 --> 00:31:22,988
Listen to me.

702
00:31:22,988 --> 00:31:25,188
That girl had enough beads
hanging from her neck

703
00:31:25,188 --> 00:31:27,088
To jewel a small city.

704
00:31:27,188 --> 00:31:30,488
Anyone exposes themselves
that much in one day

705
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:32,188
Is not a credible witness in my book.

706
00:31:32,188 --> 00:31:34,088
But she wanted to press charges.

707
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:35,888
I told her it was a waste of time.

708
00:31:36,188 --> 00:31:37,688
I knew one of the accused.

709
00:31:37,688 --> 00:31:38,888
He was a good kid.

710
00:31:38,888 --> 00:31:41,588
He didn't need the stink
of that accusation.

711
00:31:42,188 --> 00:31:43,988
So you protected a rapist ?

712
00:31:45,588 --> 00:31:47,188
Well, that right there

713
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:49,788
Was a bone of contention
between his daddy and i.

714
00:31:50,088 --> 00:31:51,088
As far as I was concerned,

715
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:53,088
No such rape ever took place.

716
00:31:53,188 --> 00:31:53,988
Are you gonna tell me

717
00:31:53,988 --> 00:31:57,088
Why you went and dragged
this dirt back through my life ?

718
00:31:59,088 --> 00:32:00,288
You know the serial killer

719
00:32:00,288 --> 00:32:02,388
Who's cutting up men
in the french quarter ?

720
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,088
She was your victim.

721
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:10,088
We're trying to find a name.

722
00:32:11,788 --> 00:32:13,388
You don't even remember her name ?

723
00:32:13,388 --> 00:32:14,788
It was 9 years ago.

724
00:32:14,788 --> 00:32:18,188
What about the name of the
"good kid" who raped her ?

725
00:32:20,788 --> 00:32:21,688
Smitty...

726
00:32:23,788 --> 00:32:26,788
You tell me right now or I'll file
a new sanction against you,

727
00:32:27,088 --> 00:32:29,488
And I guarantee you,
this time it'll stick.

728
00:32:33,888 --> 00:32:35,988
Mr. Tibideaux, we need you
to answer a few questions

729
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:39,688
About a disturbance you were
involved with in 1998.

730
00:32:41,388 --> 00:32:42,788
I don't know what you're talking about.

731
00:32:42,788 --> 00:32:44,588
At a bar called Jones.

732
00:32:46,488 --> 00:32:47,588
It was mardi gras.

733
00:32:48,688 --> 00:32:50,788
Well, then,
I must have been drinking some,

734
00:32:52,088 --> 00:32:53,688
'Cause I don't remember a thing.

735
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:56,188
We just need to know the name...

736
00:32:56,188 --> 00:32:58,288
Look, I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

737
00:32:58,288 --> 00:33:00,288
The statute of limitations is up.

738
00:33:00,288 --> 00:33:02,388
We just need a name.

739
00:33:03,388 --> 00:33:05,888
Someone accuses me of rape,
­

740
00:33:06,488 --> 00:33:08,288
I'm going to remember her name.

741
00:33:08,288 --> 00:33:09,988
What can I tell you, cher ?

742
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,988
I guess she didn't make
that good of an impression.

743
00:33:12,988 --> 00:33:15,388
Unlike yourself, right now.

744
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:16,888
You know, I'm guessing if someone

745
00:33:16,888 --> 00:33:19,188
Did do something
to that girl that night,

746
00:33:20,388 --> 00:33:22,488
Then she was probably asking for it.

747
00:33:23,488 --> 00:33:25,888
Maybe even liked it.

748
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,088
Guy's not giving up anything.

749
00:33:30,388 --> 00:33:31,488
Right after the double murder,

750
00:33:31,488 --> 00:33:32,888
What was the ripper's next move ?

751
00:33:32,888 --> 00:33:34,788
He mutilated and
dismembered Mary Kelly

752
00:33:34,788 --> 00:33:37,288
In her one-Room flat until
she was unrecognizable.

753
00:33:37,288 --> 00:33:39,288
It's believed to be his most
vicious kill of all.

754
00:33:39,288 --> 00:33:40,788
'Cause he had privacy.

755
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,288
And time to torture his victim
before killing her.

756
00:33:43,988 --> 00:33:45,288
Maybe we're not too late.

757
00:33:53,388 --> 00:33:55,888
She murdered these men,

758
00:33:56,688 --> 00:33:59,688
And I'm guessing it's only
a matter of time

759
00:33:59,688 --> 00:34:01,388
Before she works
her way back to the one

760
00:34:01,388 --> 00:34:02,988
She really wants to kill.

761
00:34:03,988 --> 00:34:05,588
She make an impression now ?

762
00:34:08,788 --> 00:34:09,788
Work me.

763
00:34:09,788 --> 00:34:12,588
We have a name... Sarah Danlin.
I need an address.

764
00:34:14,188 --> 00:34:16,288
1141 Sherman Avenue.

765
00:34:18,288 --> 00:34:19,788
It looks like she was
a med student at tulane,

766
00:34:19,788 --> 00:34:20,988
But she dropped out.

767
00:34:20,988 --> 00:34:23,388
Let me guess... February 1998.

768
00:34:25,088 --> 00:34:26,388
Yeah. Thanks.

769
00:34:26,988 --> 00:34:27,988
We got her.

770
00:34:34,188 --> 00:34:35,588
I'm John, by the way.

771
00:34:35,888 --> 00:34:36,688
John.

772
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,988
Take off your clothes.

773
00:35:09,156 --> 00:35:11,556
Sarah Danlin, F.B.I. !
Open the door.

774
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:22,956
The things I'm gonna do to you.

775
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:28,356
Me first.

776
00:35:28,956 --> 00:35:29,956
F.B.I. !

777
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:38,656
Clear. Clear.

778
00:35:39,956 --> 00:35:40,956
She's not here.

779
00:35:41,356 --> 00:35:43,156
Guys, there are some ripperologists

780
00:35:43,156 --> 00:35:44,356
Who speculate that Mary Kelly

781
00:35:44,356 --> 00:35:45,856
Was actually killed in a flat

782
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:47,856
That Jack the ripper
rented for the night.

783
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,256
I'm going to have Garcia
check Sarah Danlin's

784
00:35:49,256 --> 00:35:51,056
Credit card accounts.
It's a long shot,

785
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:53,156
But maybe we can trace her room
back to her charge cards.

786
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:02,156
Aah !

787
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:04,356
What the hell was that ?

788
00:36:04,956 --> 00:36:05,756
Shh.

789
00:36:05,756 --> 00:36:06,856
You're crazy.

790
00:36:06,956 --> 00:36:12,156
You never did explain those
"things" you could do to me.

791
00:36:14,456 --> 00:36:15,556
Souvenirs.

792
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:17,356
These are from bars
in the french quarter.

793
00:36:17,356 --> 00:36:18,756
This is from mon cherie.

794
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:22,756
She's trolling for victims
in the place where it all began.

795
00:36:22,756 --> 00:36:24,156
She can't move on.

796
00:36:24,156 --> 00:36:25,256
The rape isn't the whole story.

797
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,056
I'll bet there's a history
of sexual abuse

798
00:36:27,056 --> 00:36:28,456
That contributes to her rage as well.

799
00:36:28,456 --> 00:36:30,556
It's almost like by taking
on the ripper persona,

800
00:36:30,556 --> 00:36:33,156
She was trying to kill
something within herself.

801
00:36:34,656 --> 00:36:35,856
Yeah, mama, what do you got ?

802
00:36:35,956 --> 00:36:37,356
Sarah Danlin's visa was charged

803
00:36:37,356 --> 00:36:38,956
An hour ago at the Royal Ruby Inn.

804
00:36:38,956 --> 00:36:41,156
Ah, baby girl, you never
disappoint. Thank you.

805
00:36:42,056 --> 00:36:42,856
Royal Ruby Inn.

806
00:36:42,856 --> 00:36:44,256
That's 2 blocks from here.

807
00:36:44,556 --> 00:36:45,356
Let's go

808
00:36:51,556 --> 00:36:52,356
Please !

809
00:36:52,356 --> 00:36:54,056
Please. Please.

810
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,656
I have... I have children.

811
00:36:56,656 --> 00:36:58,956
Stop...
Please.

812
00:36:58,956 --> 00:37:00,556
You asked...

813
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,056
FBI !

814
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:03,956
Drop the knife. Drop the weapon.

815
00:37:03,956 --> 00:37:07,456
He wanted it... and he got it.

816
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,656
Put it down now.

817
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:10,456
We need an emt tech right away.

818
00:37:12,856 --> 00:37:14,456
What are you waiting for ?

819
00:37:14,456 --> 00:37:16,156
Ma'am, we don't want to shoot you.

820
00:37:16,556 --> 00:37:19,256
Be such a shame to waste this.

821
00:37:20,356 --> 00:37:21,556
Do you want it, too ?

822
00:37:21,556 --> 00:37:23,856
What I want is for you
to put that knife down.

823
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:25,556
Come on.

824
00:37:26,956 --> 00:37:28,056
Don't fight it.

825
00:37:28,056 --> 00:37:29,656
Sarah, we don't want to hurt you.

826
00:37:33,856 --> 00:37:34,956
Men.

827
00:37:35,256 --> 00:37:38,656
Sarah, my name's
William Lamontagne JR.

828
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:42,256
You knew my daddy ?

829
00:37:46,056 --> 00:37:47,256
Yeah, yeah.

830
00:37:48,156 --> 00:37:51,156
You trusted him. So trust me.

831
00:37:53,756 --> 00:37:55,156
Where is he ?

832
00:37:56,256 --> 00:37:57,556
The storm took him.

833
00:38:02,156 --> 00:38:03,656
Come on. It's over.

834
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:12,056
It's over.

835
00:38:28,256 --> 00:38:28,856
Hey.

836
00:38:29,756 --> 00:38:30,756
Hey there.

837
00:38:33,256 --> 00:38:35,956
The medic says that her
victim's going to be ok.

838
00:38:39,356 --> 00:38:41,056
I heard what you did in there.

839
00:38:43,056 --> 00:38:44,656
Your dad would be really proud.

840
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:48,256
It's weird.

841
00:38:49,256 --> 00:38:52,456
I spent all this time focused
on closing this case for him...

842
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:55,156
And now it's over.

843
00:38:56,056 --> 00:38:56,856
Yeah.

844
00:38:58,456 --> 00:39:00,956
I thought I'd feel happy,
but I just feel lost.

845
00:39:02,756 --> 00:39:04,156
Because you've...

846
00:39:05,556 --> 00:39:06,956
And now you're leaving ?

847
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:11,656
How will I survive a woman
like you going so far away ?

848
00:39:14,756 --> 00:39:17,356
Well, despite what
you may have heard...

849
00:39:20,356 --> 00:39:23,156
Cell phones can be very
good for your health.

850
00:39:26,456 --> 00:39:27,456
See ya.

851
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,056
How'd you find me ?

852
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:55,356
You're not all that hard to profile.

853
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,256
Your friend is good.

854
00:40:10,156 --> 00:40:11,856
I missed that plane on purpose.

855
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:14,956
I know.

856
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:20,156
I'm struggling.

857
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:22,956
Well... anybody who's been through

858
00:40:22,956 --> 00:40:24,856
What you've been through recently...

859
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:26,856
Would.

860
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:28,556
This is all I was groomed for.

861
00:40:28,556 --> 00:40:29,456
I never even...

862
00:40:30,856 --> 00:40:32,656
I never even considered
another option.

863
00:40:32,756 --> 00:40:34,156
Now you're questioning
whether or not

864
00:40:34,156 --> 00:40:35,856
You're strong enough to be here ?

865
00:40:37,356 --> 00:40:38,156
Yeah.

866
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,056
I have been playing at this job

867
00:40:41,756 --> 00:40:45,156
In one way or another
for almost 30 years.

868
00:40:46,756 --> 00:40:47,956
I've felt lost.

869
00:40:49,456 --> 00:40:50,856
I've felt great.

870
00:40:52,056 --> 00:40:54,556
I have felt scared,

871
00:40:55,756 --> 00:40:56,556
Sick,

872
00:40:58,356 --> 00:40:59,456
And insane.

873
00:41:03,456 --> 00:41:04,556
I don't know.

874
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,356
I guess the day this job stops
gnawing at your soul and...

875
00:41:12,956 --> 00:41:17,556
Hands... your hands stop feeling cold...

876
00:41:21,756 --> 00:41:23,656
Maybe that's the time to leave.

877
00:41:26,456 --> 00:41:28,756
I guess I just needed
to try to figure out

878
00:41:28,756 --> 00:41:30,956
If I could step away from this job.

879
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:34,056
And ?

880
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:38,856
I'll never miss another plane again.
