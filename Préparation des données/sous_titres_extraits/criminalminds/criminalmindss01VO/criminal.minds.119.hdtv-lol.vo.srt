1
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,920
what is that,maya,a boy or a girl skeleton?

2
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:27,490
El dia de los muertos!

3
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,360
Hello,uncle diego. How are you?

4
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,530
Diego!

5
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,980
Please. Don't!

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,730
Why'd you come here? You're not welcome.

7
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,400
Please,diego,leave him alone...

8
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,060
this is my mother's house,too!

9
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:08,200
Let me hear her say I am not welcome.

10
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,460
Tell him,mom.

11
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,200
Well,then.

12
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,700
My mother will never have to be disgraced by me again.

13
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:35,200
Miguel!

14
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,880
Miguel?

15
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,810
I expect that from him...

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,580
she's your mother. She loves you.

17
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,770
Not anymore.

18
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:49,090
I'll come back later for my things!

19
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,000
Mom. He'll come back.

20
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:25,280
Would you like some more? i'M glad you are here now.

21
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:31,330
I couldn't talk to you in front of rosa.

22
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,350
She likes to think she can take care of me herself.

23
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,800
But I am getting older. I need help.

24
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,180
No.

25
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,840
No!

26
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,150
No!

27
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:08,600
Yes,look at that. Oh,what is that all about?

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,200
It's ok. It's ok.

29
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,690
I'm a little grumpy when I wake up sometimes,too.

30
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:18,650
Wait,you guys.

31
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,690
See what you did?

32
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:24,160
No,no. It's ok.

33
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,410
Will you grab that? Thanks.

34
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,550
You're holding him like a cantaloupe.

35
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,300
Oh,you think you could better?

36
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,410
Ok,smarty pants,knock yourself out.

37
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,110
There you go. It's ok. It's for your--

38
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:41,470
Well,let's see you profile a disorganized psychopath.

39
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,260
It's your life.

40
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,640
Yeah

41
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,530
I know you're taking the week end,but I wanted to let you know,we got a call from--

42
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,190
ugh. Amazing!

43
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,790
I am so glad you're here,sis.

44
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:01,000
And with you coming to town,it's been so much easier to get him to take time off.

45
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,190
And I never could've prepared a meal like that by myself.

46
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,140
Go.

47
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,770
It was just a brief. In a couple of hours i'll be back,ok?

48
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,580
It's ok. Go.

49
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,760
They need you. It's all right. I'm not mad.

50
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,150
Go.

51
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,150
You heard her,she said it was all right.

52
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:29,530
You're one hell of a profiler.

53
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,170
Allende del sol,mexico,

54
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,880
population 20,000.

55
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,260
The victim is lupe trejo. 62.

56
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,560
She was found in her home,stabbed in the face,chest and genitals.

57
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,200
The papers down there connected her murder to 11 others in the past 2 years,

58
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,500
all elderly women.

59
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,740
They're saying it's the work of a serial killer.

60
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,750
The mexican government disagrees.

61
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:50,740
What kind of city is this?

62
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,750
Half factory town,half tourist town,

63
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,500
the factory makes the tchochkes and clothes that tourists buy.

64
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,020
And even though the murders have happened in the...

65
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,830
poor neighborhoods where the locals live--

66
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,250
- serial killers make lousy tourist attractions. 
- Yeah.

67
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,330
So if the government denies that this is a serial killer,

68
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,510
why'd they call us?

69
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,930
They have suspect in custody,the victim's son.

70
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,730
Where are the serial killer experts?

71
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,500
They want us to go down there and confirm that this was just a one time killing.

72
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:15,490
Put the serial killer angle to bed.

73
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,150
So we're going all the way down there just to prove they don't have a serial killer .

74
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,010
Maybe.

75
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,130
Or we're going down there to tell him if what I've read in the mexican papers is true

76
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,830
they've got one of the worst serial killers the country's ever seen,

77
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,040
let's go.

78
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,540
Hotch.

79
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,120
Call from the car.

86
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,750
Hey.

87
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,690
At least you get to spend your birthday weekend in mexico.

88
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,440
Yeah,what's dog-house in spanish?

89
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,300
"La ca-sa del pair-O."

90
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,040
La casita del perro.

91
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,800
That's what I said.

92
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,770
Face it,chicko. You're only a genius in english.

93
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:37,710
You speak spanish?

94
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,860
Since when?

95
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:40,100
I'm full of hidden mysteries.

96
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:43,160
All right,so why are there so few serial killers in mexico?

97
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,380
They probably have as many as we do,but they document almost none of them.

98
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,190
Why is that?

99
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:49,340
It's the chikatilo syndrome.

100
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:51,260
- The what? - Andre chikatilo,

101
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:54,080
one of the most prolific serial killer of the 20th century.

102
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,560
By the time they found him,he had killed more than 50 people.

103
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,220
He was no more experienced than any average serial killer,

104
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,290
but he lived in the soviet ukraine. The soviets were convinced,

105
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:07,050
the serial killer is a uniquely american phenomenon.

106
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,340
Inevitable result of decadent capitalism.

107
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:13,070
So,what's the cultural bias in mexico?

108
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,870
Many mexicans believe that serial killers are the result of the break down of the family,

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,640
which gives rise to the kind of alienated loner who becomes a serial killer.

110
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:26,000
It's a fact that there are 12 times as many broken families in the U.S. Than in mexico.

111
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:30,640
All right,so is it possible that there are fewer serial killers in mexican culture?

112
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,870
It is possible.

113
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,930
But,in my experience,evil is not a cultural phenomenon.

114
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,840
It's a human one.

115
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,050
Nothing like jet sleep,right?

116
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,420
Yeah,kind of like a night of drinking without the drinking.

117
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,070
- Agent gideon. 
- Captain navarro.

118
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,310
You're shorter than I remembered.

119
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,380
I was on a stage.

120
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,620
This is lieutenant borquez.

121
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,750
Hello.

122
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,960
This is my team.

123
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,560
Captain navarro has been put in charge of the case by the assistant attorney general.

124
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,410
You guys got history?

125
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,960
We met at a seminar i gave at mexico citya few years ago.

126
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,140
"Sexual homicide  in latin america."

127
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,960
I just read a chapter on the subject in max ryan's book.

128
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:25,500
Where do you think i got it from?

129
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,980
I'm glad you came.

130
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,650
I was never sure how much you liked me.

131
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,160
Why is that?

132
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,220
I've often told agent gideon that his profiling technique

133
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,520
would not translate accurately in latin culture

134
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,850
without a better understanding of our cultural values.

135
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,590
Now is a good time to find out,right?

136
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,950
Uh,captain,I'd like to get a handle on the type of press this

137
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,210
has been getting and meet some of the local police here.

138
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,190
Of course,

139
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:49,370
but I imagine you would all like to settle into your rooms and rest before we go?

140
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,110
No. We're ready.

141
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,940
Let's go.

142
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,250
So what exactly do you think agent gideon got wrong about your culture?

143
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,920
Well,there are two main--

144
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,490
english,english. Please. English.

145
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,310
I was explaining to agent gideon that

146
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,970
his profiling theory doesn't take into account 2 powerful influences on mexican culture.

147
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,550
Which is family,

148
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,570
and machismo.

149
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,910
You have some interesting ideas.

150
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,950
The district attorney general put me in charge of this killing

151
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,710
when she realized that we had a relationship.

152
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,650
She had me invite you down to help us settle this mess.

153
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,280
You are aware that we may not be giving you the answer you are looking for on this one,yes?

154
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,930
You think the papers are right?

155
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:36,010
What are they saying exactly?

156
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,840
SeÑorita...

157
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,310
there's a serial assassin who's killing elderly women in local towns.

158
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:48,000
And the attorney general and the authorities are moving slowly.

159
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:49,800
We'll see.

160
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,980
What's all this?

161
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,210
Dia de los muertos.

162
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,300
Day of the dead,

163
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,070
a 3-day latin holiday where souls of dead relatives are said to return to earth

164
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,870
to enjoy the pleasures that they once knew of.

165
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,870
It sounds like he was reading that out of a book.

166
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,390
No,trust me. He always sounds like that.

167
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:24,350
Actually,I was reading.

168
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,170
I picked this pamphlet up at the airport.

169
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,350
As profilers,I thought you'd want to see the crime scene first,

170
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,250
before meeting the suspects,yes?

171
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:42,630
You remembered something from my lecture,huh?

172
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:45,060
Actually,I got it from your mentor,max ryan.

173
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,310
His book.

174
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:47,940
It's a great read.

175
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,460
The victim's name is lupe trejo. 62.

176
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,300
She was found in the bedroom by the daughter.

177
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,760
No sign of forced entry.

178
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,200
Are there are always this many people around?

179
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,630
No. Church just got out.

180
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,490
They're walking home from the town square.

181
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,600
What time was she killed?

182
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,910
I'm guessing some time during the evening mass.

183
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,590
There wouldn't have been a lot of people around.

184
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,260
Otherwise he would've been seen.

185
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,870
Unless he blended right in.

186
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,610
Let's go

187
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,400
No forced entry means one of two things.

188
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,500
A push in,

189
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,350
he holds a knife or a gun to her and forces his way inside.

190
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,590
The murder weapon,the knife,

191
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,780
was taken from the kitchen and placed at the scene.

192
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,880
In that case,it's most likely that she let the killer in voluntarily.

193
00:11:29,110 --> 00:11:31,510
She looked through the peep hole,saw someone she recognized,

194
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,080
someone who makes her feel safe.

195
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,540
She lets him in and then what?

196
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,880
They have a drink?

197
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:38,270
Hey,did you run a dna analysis on this?

198
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,380
The closest thing we have to a crime scene unit is detective hernandez.

199
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:44,120
He has a fingerprinting kit from 1984.

200
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,180
Find anything?

201
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:46,800
The victim's prints were on one.

202
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,120
The prints on the other one were too smudged to make any match but

203
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:51,140
i don't think the killer drank this anyway.

204
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,400
Why not?

205
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,310
This drink is tamarind water.

206
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,440
It's sweet.

207
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,450
I could see the victim offer this to a woman.

208
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,120
But these are family festivities

209
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,490
and at night most men will have a shot of tequila,some beer and maybe some cigarettes

210
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,590
this looks like two women to me.

211
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,630
You don't think a woman could've done this?

212
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:08,650
Do you?

213
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,880
It's highly unlikely.

214
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,910
Get them to the fbi.

215
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,710
At the very least they'll be able to tell us the gender of the drinkers.

216
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,730
Where was she killed?

217
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,210
This way.

218
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,200
What are you looking for?

219
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,610
Why.

220
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,430
Why did the unsub choose this victim?

221
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,010
Why did she feel safe enough to let the killer inside?

222
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,460
This is her son?

223
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,120
That's miguel.

224
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,610
I'd say lupe had a problem with him.

225
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,740
She has family photographs everywhere,but not miguel.

226
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:00,200
He's tucked away in her drawer.

227
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:05,620
Ok,so the unsub took items of jewelry out of the daughter's bedroom.

228
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,640
You think he did it before or after he killed the mother?

229
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:08,900
I would say after.

230
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,060
The way the victim was stabbed means this was a sexual homicide.

231
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,610
When the killer is looking for a sexual release,

232
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,810
the items taken are usually an afterthought.

233
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,860
Trophies.

234
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:19,030
But he left jewelry on the victim's body. Why?

235
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,350
It's a common sign of remorse.

236
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,600
A small amount of respect for the dead.

237
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,680
Very small,if you ask me.

238
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,910
You are almost certainly looking for a heterosexual male.

239
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:33,570
Why do you say that?

240
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,640
Well,the victim was found on the bed,

241
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,630
multiple stab wounds to the face,chest and genital area.

242
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:41,790
All indicators of sexual homicide.

243
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:43,520
In case it's a sexual homicide,

244
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,830
the attacker targets objects of his or her sexual attraction.

245
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,630
Heterosexual men attack women.

246
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,880
So homosexual men attack men?

247
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,720
Did the daughter have any ideas about who might have done this?

248
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,460
She didn't have any ideas about anything.

249
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,560
When she found out that her brother was a suspect,

250
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:59,210
she wanted to talk to him alone.

251
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,890
I refused because i didn't want them to get their stories straight.

252
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:04,170
Then she stopped talking completely.

253
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:06,350
So what's she protecting?

254
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,930
We're ready to talk to the suspect.

255
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,060
Of course,

256
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,900
but first there's someone I'd like you to meet.

257
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,170
Maria sanchez.

258
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,640
District attorney general.

259
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:19,180
Do not be afraid.

260
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,740
- Agent gideon.- Hello

261
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,310
It's an honor.

262
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,380
Our papers are fascinated with the idea of a serial killer.

263
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,390
And when navarro suggested that i invite you in to dispel this nonsense,

264
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,140
I immediately saw the wisdom.

265
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,710
But-- enough formalities.

266
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,860
I will let you get down to business.

267
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,710
Excuse me.

268
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,570
She's worse in spanish.

269
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:48,370
Neighbors heard a loud fight the day of the murder.

270
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,030
Between the victim,her son,

271
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:51,590
daughter and brother-in-law.

272
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,870
One big happy family.

273
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,440
Well the uncle had a solid alibi.

274
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,940
But we could not find the son.

275
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,290
Then got a tip he had hired a coyote to take him over the border.

276
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,030
We caught him before he crossed.

277
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,450
That's miguel's sister,rosa.

278
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:06,470
She's been here ever since she found out that her brother was arrested.

279
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,490
Seems though she thinks he's innocent.

280
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,320
The dutiful sister.

281
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,220
This way.

282
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,070
You're gonna tell us about the fight you had with your mother the other night.

283
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,090
I didn't hurt my mother.

284
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:28,950
Did it have anything to do with you leaving?

285
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,450
She didn't want me to go.

286
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,170
She was angry.

287
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,320
It was more than that,miguel.

288
00:15:40,490 --> 00:15:43,490
You had problems with your mother for a long time.

289
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:48,390
What is it you're hiding?

290
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,090
What truth could be so terrible that

291
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,750
you don't defend yourself against killing your mother?

292
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,010
What truth would have your mother hiding your photographs in her drawer?

293
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,200
When did you first know?

294
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,440
Know what?

295
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,750
That you are a homosexual.

296
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:13,190
More to the point,

297
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,580
when did your mother find out?

298
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,280
No speak english.

299
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,140
How did he know?

300
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,360
You told us.

301
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:29,880
Machismo and family. You knew he was gay.

302
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,650
You're a better profiler than gideon as a lecturer.

303
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,780
You also knew that a gay man couldn't have committed this murder.

304
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,600
That's why you asked us about the sexuality of the killer at the crime scene,

305
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,770
you knew miguel was innocent.

306
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,620
You don't understand how things work here.

307
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,330
If I told the attorney general that this one is a homosexual

308
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:45,040
and that is why he must be innocent she would've laughed in my face.

309
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,210
Why did you lie to us?

310
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,850
I had to play along with the official line until i could trust that

311
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,990
you would come to the same conclusion that I did.

312
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,780
So we are here to serve as pawns in your political game.

313
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,120
There is a very bad man killing women in my district.

314
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:58,880
And I've known this for a very long time.

315
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,470
But so far,no one will believe me.

316
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:02,130
Or help stop him.

317
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,060
So if I have to play politics to protect the women of the city...

318
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,560
then that is a very small price to pay.

319
00:17:09,670 --> 00:17:11,870
Don't you agree?

320
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:18,200
the best way to bring the attorey general on board is by providing a complete profile.

321
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,320
What do you need from me?

322
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,830
We need the files of all the murders.

323
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,680
Of course,but i must warn you.

324
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,730
These reports were taken by local police in the area

325
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,860
who are not used to this type of thing.

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,900
Most basic details are missing.

327
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:29,820
We'll take a look at them.

328
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,900
We also need to get the whole story out of miguel trejo.

329
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,300
And right now he's not talking.

330
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,740
Why does that matter?

331
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,470
Obviously,he's not a serial killer.

332
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:39,240
'Cause there's obviously a great deal of anger in the family,

333
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,880
and before we give a profile we need to rule out the fact that

334
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:45,020
this might be a crime of passion and not one of the serial killings.

335
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,070
Why wouldn't miguel talk if he's innocent?

336
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,630
Must have something to do with the fact that he's a homosexual.

337
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,090
He'd rather be straight in jail than gay as a free man?

338
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,810
I can protect him in here.

339
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,460
But if he's taken to a prison in mexico city

340
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,680
and the other inmates find out that he is gay he will be killed.

341
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,860
That's the way things work here.

342
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,950
So how do we get him to talk?

343
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:07,980
Rosa.

344
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,440
Do you know the saying,

345
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,080
"love is blind,but not the neighbors"?

346
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:15,040
We know there was a fight.

347
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,800
We need to know what it was about.

348
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,120
Rosa?

349
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:23,060
We know about your brother.

350
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:26,420
If you don't help us he could go to prison

351
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,140
and he could be killed there.

352
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:34,510
This could be his last chance,rosa.

353
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,830
Do you understand?

354
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,660
Miguel

355
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,330
has a friend.

356
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,240
Roberto.

357
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,090
He was outside the house,

358
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,930
waiting for my brother.

359
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:52,650
Watching.

360
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,010
He saw the fight with my mother.

361
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,600
Did miguel see him?

362
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,300
I don't think so.

363
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,760
Why didn't you tell us about this before?

364
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,160
Because it would mean telling you that...

365
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:07,630
miguel is...

366
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:15,380
like you said,if he goes to prison

367
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,110
and they know this about

368
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,320
him they will kill him.

369
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:21,330
And I could not risk that.

370
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:24,830
But you're talking about the man who might have murdered your mother.

371
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:27,530
You do not understand how bad it is.

372
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,420
You do not understand the shame!

373
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:34,110
You do not understand what people will do to us.

374
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,540
I just lost my mother. I cannot lose miguel.

375
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,300
La familia es todo.

376
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,000
Family is everything.

377
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:51,510
She may have come clean about that day,

378
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,200
but i still think she's hiding something.

379
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,440
The way she went on about shame--

380
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,480
almost like she was talking about herself.

381
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,440
This is interesting.

382
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:01,690
Before miguel met roberto roberto had a wife.

383
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,630
Well if he was bisexual--

384
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,480
that makes him capable of sexual homicide of a woman.

385
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,210
And if he blamed miguel's mother for denying their relationship

386
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,800
that would give him a motive.

387
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,770
We need to find roberto.

388
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:18,700
Roberto

389
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,880
we have to talk.

390
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,760
Please. Not right here.

391
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,850
Let's walk. Let's go.

392
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,680
You don't understand.

393
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,330
I would never hurt miguel's mother.

394
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,910
She was nice to me.

395
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,120
She was...trying to accept me.

396
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,030
But miguel's uncle made her feel bad for that.

397
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,410
People like him make it impossible for us.

398
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,020
They'll never accept us.

399
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,820
Why'd you follow miguel to his house?

400
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,430
And why were you watching rosa and her mother?

401
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,350
Miguel and I had a fight that day.

402
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,800
He was very upset.

403
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,630
He got drunk.

404
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,710
He was going to his family celebration and i was afraid for him,

405
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,350
I was afraid ofthe trouble he might cause with his uncle.

406
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,770
What did you see?

407
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,920
Miguel did not do it.

408
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,640
Is that what you want from me? To turn against him?

409
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,950
I won'T. He did not do it.

410
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:05,950
No. It's not what I asked.

411
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,990
You were outside of the house watching.

412
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,560
So what did you see?

413
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,750
Uh,I saw nothing. I saw children playing and,uh--

414
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:13,700
a woman.

415
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,460
What woman?

416
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,210
I walked past her in the street,uh--

417
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,530
she had papers,a badge.

418
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,970
I think she was a social worker going house to house.

419
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,290
- What did she look like? 
- I don't know. Heavy.

420
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,440
Maybe... forties or fifties.

421
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:30,590
- Gracias. 
- Ok.

422
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,380
It is common for social workers and nurses to come from the city,help out elderly women.

423
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,420
Tell them about benefits they may have.

424
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,720
It's part of the reaching out program.

425
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,970
So it could've been the victim who invited the social worker inside,

426
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,860
or maybe she was the one given the tamarind water.

427
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:46,920
Or she could be our best witness.

428
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,790
I will check with local services.

429
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,490
What about roberto?

430
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,560
I don't think he did it.

431
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,320
Why not?

432
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:55,010
The way he talked about miguel.

433
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,620
He didn't point the finger at his boyfriend. I think a guilty man would've.

434
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,170
See if he has an alibi.

435
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:01,580
Run his prints against any found at the scene.

436
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,810
Right now,though,

437
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,250
I feel confident we can rule out a family fight as a motive for the murder.

438
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,820
There's a call from the fbi.

439
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,890
Yeah. Morgan.

440
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,520
Como esta,my lovelies?

441
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:15,790
Es bueno,no? Tripero,esta-la?

442
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,630
Ok,take it easy garcia,I think you just offended somebody's mother.

443
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,170
Shut up,you. I took french,what can I say?

444
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,710
Penelope,your last name is garcia.

445
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:24,370
Yeah,I know,it's my stepfather's name.

446
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,650
Now do you want my genius or not?

447
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,430
Yes,please. Get on with it.

448
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:28,670
Okay! So,

449
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,910
i rushed your cups full of mucus through all the regular channels at lightning speed

450
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,680
and survey says one female drinker and one male.

451
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,890
Thanks,doll.

452
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:38,460
It's strange.

453
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:40,800
On this occasion,a man taking that drink.

454
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,520
Unless the victim thought he was a woman.

455
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,930
The woman roberto described,the social worker,

456
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,080
that's a common ruse for old lady killers. What if...

457
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,510
she is really a he in women's clothing?

458
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,410
A heavy woman.

459
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,360
He comes to the door,knocks on it...

460
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:56,840
And the victim feels comfortable because...

461
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,160
she thinks it's a woman.

462
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,750
It would explain why no witnesses have come forward.

463
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,180
No one expects the killer to be a woman.

464
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,560
Not in this country.

465
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:06,010
Or ours.

466
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,210
We need to tell the locals.

467
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,960
And give them the rest of the profile.

468
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,210
We have reason to believe that the killer may be a man who wears women's clothing.

469
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:14,460
As a ruse to get into his victim's homes.

470
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,470
Once inside,the killer stabs his victims

471
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,040
and then abuses them sexually with the knife.

472
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,650
But he wasn't always a killer.

473
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,620
He gradually escalated from sex crimes.

474
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:25,630
This may have started out as peeping tom incidents eventually leading to rape.

475
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,830
And then at some point,he couldn't rape anymore.

476
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:31,120
So he began killing women who represented authority figures in this life he hated.

477
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:33,060
Typically a mother,grandmother.

478
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,580
Women that he blamed for his impotence.

479
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,050
Navarro: How would he have targeted these women?

480
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,990
We found no connection between them.

481
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,900
We don't know yet.

482
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:40,710
But based on the number of times he's killed

483
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:43,190
and the skill of gaining the trust of his victims

484
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,060
we can assume that he plans his murders and

485
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:47,280
that he's been committing sex crimes for many years.

486
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:50,360
We think he's somewhere between the ages of 35-50.

487
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,330
You need to talk to all known sex offenders.

488
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,910
And compare them to this profile.

489
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,950
You should also re-interview all your witnesses

490
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,240
and see if anyone saw a man who might have been dressed as a woman.

491
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:04,750
Gracias.

492
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,780
We have another body.

493
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:15,330
Isabel santiago,67.

494
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,080
No sign of forced entry.

495
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,100
Stabbed in the chest and genitals.

496
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:21,100
Abrasions on her neck.

497
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,800
Beads.

498
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,120
From a necklace.

499
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,510
Obviously ripped off her neck.

500
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,330
Yeah,but jewelry taken form the body.

501
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,070
That's the first we've seen from this guy.

502
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,110
So why was this one different?

503
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:44,130
For the past 2 years we've had an average of 1 killing every 9 weeks.

504
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:46,130
Not 2 in 3 days.

505
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,550
That's a pretty extreme escalation.

506
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,510
He'll kill again soon.

507
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,930
Who's that over there?

508
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,230
That's the daughter of the victim.

509
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,640
Maybe she could tell us something about the necklace.

510
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,600
Hello,anna. My name is elle. I'm sorry about everything.

511
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,560
I have some questions for you,if you could answer them.

512
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,240
Do you think you might be able to answer a few questions right now

513
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:11,220
Si. Yes.

514
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,350
Your mother was wearing a necklace,it was taken from her.

515
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:17,970
Do you know if it had any special significance to her?

516
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:22,380
She gave it to me for my birthday.

517
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:27,600
She never bought jewelry for herself.

518
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:30,880
She asked if she could wear it during the holiday.

519
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,250
So this cklace was yours?

520
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,400
It was my favorite.

521
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:38,340
I wore it almost every day.

522
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,140
Navarro says there's some sort of disturbance at the police station.

523
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:43,400
- We're gonna go check it out.
- Ok.

524
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,060
What is going on here borquez?

525
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,100
What did they do?

526
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,770
What did they do?

527
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,110
They're following the orders of the fbi

528
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,480
bringing in sex criminals.

529
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:00,830
What did you tell them?

530
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,740
We put out there the possibility that he dresses like a woman.

531
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,920
We told them to look into people convicted of sex crimes.

532
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,130
We didn't mean this.

533
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:14,570
Maria,please.

534
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,100
What is going on?

535
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,800
These men were supposed to put the serial killer rumors to rest

536
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,080
and now they are making us look like a joke.

537
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,440
What'd you want people to think of us?

538
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,550
It was a misunderstanding.

539
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,840
And it won't happen again.

540
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,720
It was your idea to bring them here.

541
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,790
And obviously it was a waste of time.

542
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:30,850
Please...

543
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:32,500
...go home.

544
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,150
These police are not stupid men.

545
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,350
They're frustrated.

546
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:54,710
They read articles in newspapers saying that they're ineffective.

547
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,190
And they want to prove that they are not.

548
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,950
They will do this any way they know how.

549
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:00,500
We told them that the suspect was probably a man dressed as a woman.

550
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,280
We didn't say to round up all the transvestites and bring them in.

551
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,030
Why?

552
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,210
Is it possible that this man is a transvestite?

553
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,640
No,no,no. That's not what we're saying.

554
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,290
Men dressing like women is a manifestation of sexual preference,it is a lifestyle.

555
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,840
It does not imply a psychology of violent behavior.

556
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:17,300
We're talking about the killer's past.

557
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,720
That's why we were asking for people who'd been accused of sex crimes.

558
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:20,780
Are the police looking onto this?

559
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,860
How?

560
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,750
Most rapes here are not even reported.

561
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,160
And the rapists are often people who have power them.

562
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:28,260
Sometimes family,

563
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,990
sometimes even law enforcement.

564
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,090
I have interviewed many,many women and--

565
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:34,290
they do not want to talk.

566
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,520
We can help you.

567
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,580
We can teach you interview strategies.

568
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,960
I specialized in sex crimes and i speak spanish.

569
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,490
How do we even get to these women?

570
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,930
We hold a press conference.

571
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,370
Let everyone know what we're looking for.

572
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:46,980
What about the attorney general? She wants us to leave.

573
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,540
Do not worry about her.

574
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,980
I convinced her to bring you down here.

575
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,480
I can convince her to let you stay.

576
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,440
We will have that press conference.

577
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,050
All I have to do is figure out...

578
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,570
what to say.

579
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,760
Be forceful,

580
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:02,830
but respectful.

581
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:07,230
tell them,"Please,if you have any information at all,we urge you to come forward."

582
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,820
The one thing we absolutely do know about this kind of criminal

583
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:12,760
is that he does not stop offending until he is stopped.

584
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,910
The reporters will ask,

585
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,250
"why look for a rapist when we're trying to catch a killer?"

586
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,070
You don't need to mention the killer.

587
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,240
Just tell them that you care about the women in this town,

588
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:24,550
and that you are committed to catching the man who hurt them.

589
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,220
Why are we looking for a rapist?

590
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,280
Because we know this man commits sexual homicide,

591
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,160
we could also assume that he was once a rapist.

592
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,850
It's a lot easier to track a rapist than a killer because you have witnesses.

593
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,770
You also have the chance to discover something else.

594
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:38,440
The reason he began killing.

595
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,620
Which is the stressor.

596
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,170
As far as we can tell,the first killing

597
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,680
was about two years ago.

598
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,320
What happened to the suspect during that time?

599
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,510
A typical stressor.

600
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,700
Loss of job.

601
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,000
Loss of love.

602
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:52,180
He may have been released from prison.

603
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,010
Whatever it was it made him feel impotent

604
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:55,940
made him feel frustrated and very angry.

605
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,270
And that's when he started killing.

606
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,980
You should be talking to victims who reported rapes

607
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:01,130
just before that first murder two years ago.

608
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:04,200
Hopefully the press conference will help bring some of these women forward

609
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:07,450
but we also need to head out and talk to some of these people directly.

610
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,960
You should use all the female police you have.

611
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:11,050
That'll help put potential victims at ease.

612
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,260
We don't have any,boss.

613
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,640
You do now.

614
00:29:17,970 --> 00:29:19,830
Ok. See you later.

615
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,060
I've been talking to so many women and forgetting how to speak english.

616
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,950
Well,you know,you look latina.

617
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,490
There's a good reason for that. My mother's cuban.

618
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,640
Well,my cuban friend. We may have something.

619
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,350
A woman called the police station after she saw the report on television.

620
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,120
Yeah?

621
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,160
She says she has information on the rapist.

622
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,280
Excuse me.

623
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:47,360
I was told you want to talk to me about the rapist we're looking for.

624
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,890
Can you help us?

625
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:51,360
Do you care?

626
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,980
I'm sorry?

627
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,390
Do you care?

628
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:57,570
Most of the time nobody around here cares what happens to women.

629
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,620
Nobody does anything about it.

630
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:02,460
That's why nobody talks to the police.

631
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,830
Gimme a second.

632
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,950
Ok.

633
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,220
What can the police do

634
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:11,810
if when a crime is committed no one comes forward?

635
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,530
The man who attack me is a stupid dog.

636
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,570
He's a coward.

637
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:21,540
He came up from behind and he started to rape me.

638
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,940
But then I turned around and I started hitting him.

639
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,450
I scratched him,I made him bleed.

640
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:29,360
And that's when i saw he was wearing a dress.

641
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,190
A dress.

642
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,780
I couldn't believe it.

643
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,880
I laughed in his face.

644
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:39,720
A called him a pathetic woman.

645
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,070
He was so scared.

646
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,580
He ran away like a little boy.

647
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,410
When did this happen,milagros?

648
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,210
2 years ago.

649
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:50,790
If you weren't afraid of this man,why didn't you report him?

650
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,860
I told you what good would it do?

651
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,360
She claimed it happened 2 years ago,

652
00:30:58,470 --> 00:30:59,340
in august.

653
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,290
The first murder happened in september.

654
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,450
So she could've been the last one who was raped

655
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,680
before whatever stressor made him kill.

656
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,330
Or she could've been the stressor.

657
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,290
You say this woman laughed in his face,

658
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,230
hit him,called him a woman.

659
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:12,950
Could've been enough to make him impotent.

660
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,680
He tries to rape again and all he can hear is this woman laughing.

661
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,400
Maybe he thought he could rape older women.

662
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:18,760
Thought they'd be easier,

663
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,180
wouldn't put up a fight,so he tries.

664
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:21,080
But he can'T.

665
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,680
He gets frustrated,he kills her,

666
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,090
and then he finds the release that he was looking for.

667
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,070
So he kills again.

668
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,280
Excuse me.

669
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,440
Send them in.

670
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:35,270
You wanted us to come forward?

671
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,010
There are 6 more women who were raped by this man.

672
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,030
Now prove to us it will finally do some good.

673
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,790
Hi.

674
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:23,730
how did you find all these women,milagros?

675
00:32:23,930 --> 00:32:25,360
Mr. Navarro.

676
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,230
We may not talk to you.

677
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,640
But we talk to each other.

678
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,700
But now you must tell us your stories.

679
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:31,960
Every detail.

680
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:35,500
Because the cycle does not end until this man is stopped.

681
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:36,970
You understand?

682
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:39,010
Yes.

683
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,530
They all have the same story.

684
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,110
He goes up to them in the street,

685
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,680
puts a knife against their back,

686
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,640
blindfolds them,and takes them out to the desert.

687
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,520
He also kissed their neck while raping them.

688
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,930
And then,when he's finished,he asks,

689
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:10,220
"how did I do"?

690
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,080
Classic power reassurance behavior.

691
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:13,060
What does that mean?

692
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,250
Power reassurance rapists lack confidence.

693
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,200
They can't develop normal relationships with women.

694
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,000
Passive and non-athletic.

695
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,860
He most likely fantasizes that the victims are his girlfriends,

696
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,420
and of the different types of rapists, he's the most likely to be dissuaded if the victim 

697
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,650
screams or struggles in any way.

698
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,700
Is that it?

699
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:32,050
All the characteristics of the power-assurance rapist?

700
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,410
Uh,there's actually one more.

701
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,280
Excuse me. 

702
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,690
I've been going over the forms filled out by the women.

703
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:38,770
4 of them work in the same factory.

704
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,110
He most likely lives and works near the victim.

705
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,450
I have owned this plant for 9 years.

706
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,800
And I do not allow the men I hire to abuse the women.

707
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,500
I'm sorry,but i do not believe this man works here.

708
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,640
Miss,the man we're looking for wouldn't be openly abusive.

709
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:06,410
He might just like following women around and peeking into women's bathrooms,

710
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,220
that sort of thing.

711
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,620
He would be shy with women,specially you.

712
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:12,230
You intimidate him, he probably couldn't look you in the eye.

713
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,420
The only way i could be a woman and run this plant 

714
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:17,390
is to make sure every man feels that way.

715
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,470
I'm sorry.

716
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:22,420
How many men work here?

717
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,250
Over 50.

718
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:28,720
We need to look through all your employee records.

719
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,220
So far I found more than 3 dozen men 

720
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,410
fit the target profile between the ages of 35 and 50.

721
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:36,940
This owner wasn't kidding.

722
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:41,060
Almost all of these guys had a citation for lewd behavior against the women here.

723
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,370
They'd be warned once,

724
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,290
and then they'd be fired if it happened again.

725
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,300
I wouldn't mess with her.

726
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,510
- Afraid of a woman,hutch? 
- Shoot, I'd be afraid of her.

727
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,200
Only one of these men showed up on police records,

728
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,430
with a sex crime.

729
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,500
He beat up a prostitute when she refused to get rough.

730
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:57,280
Not out guy. He'd be scared,he wouldn't have the confidence to stand up to a refusal.

731
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,170
But this is crazy.

732
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,330
There's way too many men here to interview and not enough time.

733
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,860
Ok,we need to narrow down the profile. What would make our guy stand out?

734
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,960
From you told me, he completely lacks machismo.

735
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,240
He has none of the confidence of a typical man in mexico.

736
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,810
Morgan: Even with a knife in his hand.

737
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,930
What was it that he said to the women after raping them?

738
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,210
"How did i do?"

739
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:15,210
Any guy with confidence doesn't need to ask if he's doing a good job.

740
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,160
He assumes it.

741
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,620
In bed and at work.

742
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,350
In bed and at work.

743
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,790
Come on.

744
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,890
Mrs. Ramirez?

745
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,010
Wait.

746
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:29,120
This guy desperately wants to impress you.

747
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,340
No matter how small the job,

748
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,740
he always wants your approval

749
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:33,450
he may constantly ask,"how did I do"?

750
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,990
- How did I do? - How did I do?

751
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,220
Pablo vargas.

752
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:42,040
He's been on vacation since 4 days ago.

753
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,460
The day of lupe trejo's killing.

754
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,420
What does he do here?

755
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:48,740
He's the floor manager of sector 16, women's plus sizes.

756
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,970
We're gonna need his address and any other information you can give us, thank you.

757
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,080
Hello,

758
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,620
anybody home?

759
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,600
Hello?

760
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,460
There's a tv on,someone's inside.

761
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,670
Ready.

762
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,280
Hello?

763
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:37,890
Hello?

764
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,940
Are you all right?

765
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,460
Can you hear me?

766
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,730
Hotch!

767
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,710
Who's the lady

768
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,390
Souvenirs for his mother?

769
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,090
Anna's necklace.

770
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,610
Elle,look at this.

771
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,190
His rape victims.

772
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,070
We have a name but...

773
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,040
how do you find him?

774
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:39,450
We always ask "why this victim,why the next victim?"

775
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:41,080
Serial killers plan their killings,

776
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,090
and if we can figure out how he targets his victims,

777
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,770
we can get ahead of him.

778
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:47,210
Borquez,what is this?

779
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,190
I charted all the names of all the rape victims who came in,

780
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,530
like they instructed us.

781
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,080
That name, "torres."

782
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,000
There was a murder victim with that name.

783
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,010
There are 100s of torreses in this town.

784
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:59,540
Let me see the statements.

785
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,980
What is it?

786
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,030
It's maiden names.

787
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,430
The murder victims. And the rape victims.

788
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,020
The names are the same.

789
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,620
He's killing the mothers of the women he raped.

790
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,970
And he's doing it in the same order.

791
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:42,070
The daughters of the last 2 murder victims, trejo and santiago,never came forward.

792
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:44,450
If we can assume they were raped,then--

793
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,480
according to the board the next rape victim in the line was--

794
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,680
milagros villanueva.

795
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,620
His last.

796
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,660
He's gonna kill her mother.

797
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,610
Morgan?

798
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,240
What's up? You're all right?

799
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,560
Yeah.

800
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,480
- You're good? - Behind you.

801
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,640
Elle.

802
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:49,040
Over here!

803
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:55,020
Got me?

804
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:57,190
Yeah. Got you.

805
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:21,920
He pretended to be a woman.

806
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:25,130
Now he doesn't have to pretend.

807
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:57,810
Will they be charged?

808
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:00,040
Charged? Why?

809
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,320
They were only defending their homes.

810
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,630
La casa no se reclina sobre la tierra,

811
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,360
sino sobre una mujer.

812
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,270
Exactly.

813
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,460
Good job agent gideon.

814
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,280
Let's go.

815
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,730
What did you say in there?

816
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,920
Just an old mexican proverb.

817
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,210
Please do not hesitate to call next time you're in town.

818
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,610
Thank you.

819
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,070
I'm thinking of starting a B.A.U. In my district.

820
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:35,670
Takes a lot of training.

821
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,230
Thank you.

822
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,580
You're welcome.

823
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,960
Thanks.

824
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,170
Mexican proverb,

825
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:54,600
"the house does not rest on the ground,

826
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:57,480
but upon a woman."

827
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:00,960
