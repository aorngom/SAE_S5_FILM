1
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,000
- Hey!
- Hey! Yeah, thank you.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:09,800
Where is Elle?

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,200
Texas.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,400
Yes, she went to do a ...

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,400
The child murder?

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,800
Yes, he agreed to participate the ...

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,400
You're letting her do ...

8
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,600
She'll be fine.

9
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,200
Hello?

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,800
Dad. I.. kind of wracked into another car.

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:01,400
You did what?

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,900
I..

13
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,200
Will you ...

14
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
Well..

15
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,400
You know what. I'm done with you Josh.

16
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,000
Don't bother coming home.

17
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,000
Let's get married.

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,800
married?

19
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,800
Yeah. Why not? We get married, have the kid.

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,300
No.

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,400
I'm going to Dallas to take care of it.

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,700
I don't understand.

23
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,500
I won't be here when you get back, ...

24
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,300
then filing for divoice.

25
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,900
I'm leaving you.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm going to Dallas, don't follow me.

27
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,200
Linda, are you sure taking him to Dallas is a good idea?

28
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,900
I have written two books on this.

29
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,500
and he is living ...

30
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,300
We're going to that conference.

31
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,800
Gideon.

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,700
It's me.

33
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,000
They refused cooporating?

34
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,600
I won't even be there for an hour.

35
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,100
I took a train from El Paso instead of renting a car.

36
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:29,400
I wanna to look over the file.

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,400
remember he can lie..

38
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,600
If I know the crime better than he does

39
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,800
Yeah, I remember that.

40
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,100
Good, check when you are done.

41
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,900
Wait.

42
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:40,800
Elle, I ...

43
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,500
What?

44
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,600
I said I'm ...

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,400
We.. I'm losing you.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,900
Elle, I don't have time right now,
we can talk to when you get back.

47
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,600
Yeah, Ok, tomorrow.

48
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,400
Elle..

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,400
Hello!

50
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,600
Hello!

51
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,500
Elle!

52
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,800
Don't you see that?

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,300
Leave me alone.

54
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:20,900
Look.

55
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,200
File, Ted, look at the file.

56
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,800
I told you what was happening.

57
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,300
I told you where we were really going.

58
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,600
What the hell was that?

59
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
Everything is all right folks.

60
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,300
All right just relax, everything is gonna be fine.

61
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,600
Everything is fine.

62
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,300
What happened?

63
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,500
...

64
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
You on a job?

65
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,700
FBI.

66
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:16,000
Suicide, somebody jumped in front of the train.

67
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
What the hell they whisper about?

68
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,800
But fortunately we have procedures on very well.

69
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,200
No, he says...

70
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,400
...

71
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,600
...

72
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,400
Oh my ...!

73
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,400
Nobody move!

74
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,600
Okay.

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You don't have to hurt anybody else.

76
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,500
What are you doing?

77
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,900
Shut up!

78
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,100
Your job is...

Criminal Minds
Season 1 Episode 9

82
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,300
Okay, this is from one of the security cameras inside the train.

83
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,100
5 hostages and car ... on the tracks.

84
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,300
We have one security guy dead from the initial gun fire.

85
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,500
Is this going on right now?

86
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,800
Yeah, in Texas.

87
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,900
What are they asking for us?

88
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,500
There is a particular pyschological aspect to the hostage ...

89
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,600
Can you back up the picture for a few frames?

90
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,100
...

91
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,500
What's more of ...

92
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:16,200
...

93
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,400
So this guy is psychotic.

94
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Psychotic with hostages.

95
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,700
and two guns.

96
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,400
That is the situation on the train?

97
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:22,700
Yeah, in Texas.

98
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,200
The train in Texas.

99
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,500
My god!

100
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,300
What?

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Elle!

102
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,500
Robert Oxton Bolton wrote

103
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,800
"A belief is not merely an idea that mind possesses.

104
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,300
It is an idea that possesses the mind."

105
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,900
Local authorities have the train surrounded.

106
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,400
Bureau, hostage rescue teams and snipers in position.

107
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,800
But they are hesitant to take actions to negotiation ... exhausted.

108
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,100
The ... from the train's two video cameras are being monitored

109
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,900
and mobile commands ...

110
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,000
We need to know who on the train is going to be a help who is gonna be a problem.

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,900
All right, let me get Garcia to see what some magic done to the video feeds.

112
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,900
...

113
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,000
Garcia.

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,100
Precisely.

115
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,500
Okay listen, we're not playing.

116
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:18,200
We're gonna be feeding you with some security camera video from a hostage situation over a security line.

117
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,100
Can you work a face recognition off the road and tell me who is who?

118
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,600
If they have the picture on file anywhere, I'll find them.

119
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,500
Penelope.

120
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,700
Elle is one of the hostages.

121
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,100
I'm into it.

122
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,000
Should get to us tonight.

123
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,700
Do we have any contact inside the train yet?

124
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:38,300
No. It took two hours to convince them to allow to await for the phone.

125
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:44,300
But he won't speak to anyone except what he calls the higher authorities.

126
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,000
God?

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,600
No mention of religion thus far.

128
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,900
Has crisis negotiation's lead claimed to be the higher authority?

129
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,300
The unsub won't speak to him any longer.

130
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,400
He gave a deadline of 3 hours to produce this authority.

131
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,000
3 hours, When was that?

132
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,100
Um...2 1/2 hours ago.

133
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
Well, he wants to speak to the higher authority.

134
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,500
Then we better give it to him.

135
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,100
Put the lights on, sirens, honk the horns

136
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,900
make people get out of our away.

137
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,100
Get as close to the barricade as possible.

138
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:11,900
When we stop, we sit. We wait 30 seconds. Then we step out.

139
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,300
Here they come.

140
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,000
Showtime, Teddy.

141
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Teddy, you have to listen to me.

142
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,000
No!

143
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,900
You have to listen to me now.

144
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:57,900
Ooh, lady, your boyfriend is whacked out of his mind.

145
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,300
He's not my boyfriend.

146
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:00,800
Then who is he?

147
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,600
He's a psych patient, right?

148
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,900
Yes. It's going to be ok.

149
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,500
And you know that how?

150
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,200
You're his doctor?

151
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,300
I was taking him to Dallas to speak at a conference

152
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:17,000
as an example of the progress being made to relieve severe psychosis.

153
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,800
He's an example of progress?

154
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,700
What do we do to calm him?

155
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:24,900
He's never had this sort of break from reality, never been violent.

156
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,300
What can we do?

157
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,200
Make him feel less threatened.

158
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,900
We're a threat to him? He's got 2 guns.

159
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,700
Are you all right?

160
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,700
No...

161
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,900
Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

162
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,900
Oh, great.

163
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,000
Are you all right?

164
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Yeah. Uhh!

165
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:50,600
I just haven't been feeling that well lately. My stomach...

166
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,900
You're not pregnant?

167
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Teddy, please. This girl is sick.

168
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,200
It's a trick, Ted.

169
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,400
Shut up! Sit down!

170
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,300
What are you doing?

171
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,700
Don't be stupid.

172
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
Are you kidding me?

173
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,900
What are you gonna do? Throw it at him?

174
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Why are they just sitting there?

175
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,400
Come on!

176
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,400
Whacked out of his mind.

177
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,800
Don't look at the train. Ignore it.

178
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,900
The higher authority isn't concerned about losing a few civilians.

179
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,500
I'll talk to the HRT commander.

180
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm Frank Moretti, Dallas field office.

181
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,600
Hi.

182
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,100
Near as we can tell, your agent is still all right.

183
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,400
Has the subject asked for anything, made any demands?

184
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,000
Not beyond wanting to talk to a higher authority.

185
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,000
How do we negotiate with a psychotic who won't talk to us?

186
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,800
That depends on the level of his particular delusion.

187
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,600
Some psychotics believe they're being sent messages by the government

188
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,400
god, even aliens.

189
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:33,300
John Nash, he believed he was being recruited by aliens to save the world.

190
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:34,500
I saw the movie.

191
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,500
Actually, the movie is rather inaccurate in its portrayal of--

192
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,700
Ok, doc, doc, doc

193
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,700
a movie review is not gonna help us right now. Let's move.

194
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,800
You're right. Sorry.

195
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,200
What's the status?

196
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,100
We're in position from every angle.

197
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,300
All right. We might be able to negotiate with this guy

198
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,700
but if he requests a priest

199
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
or if his behavior in any way reflects an end game

200
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,600
of killing himself and the hostages, then its over

201
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,500
and we need to take the shot and rush the train.

202
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,000
We'll be ready when you need us.

203
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,400
Come on.

204
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,000
Come on, come on, come on.

205
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,800
This is going to end today.

206
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,500
Stay focused here, Ted.

207
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,400
His delusions are important

208
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,600
because that's what we have to play to.

209
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,100
So the question of the day...

210
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
what does he believe is happening here?

211
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,300
Good luck.

212
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,500
I tried to convince him I was the highest authority

213
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,900
but he wouldn't believe me.

214
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,000
Well, he's paranoid. He believes in secrets.

215
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,500
If I'm the higher authority, I don't go to him.

216
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,700
He comes to me.

217
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,400
We have to help him ask the first question.

218
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,500
Hey, guys.

219
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,400
Ted, you have to try and--

220
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,200
get up!

221
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,600
- Take me.
- Aah! No!

222
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,200
Take me! No, take me.

223
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,500
You think I'm gonna let you send them messages?

224
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,300
They're gonna want to talk to me.

225
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,900
I can get you whatever it is that you want. Take me!

226
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,200
Don't buy it, Ted.

227
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,200
Hey, man--

228
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:23,700
You, too?

229
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,900
No. No. I didn't do anything!

230
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,600
Ted, you're not in any danger here.

231
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,000
You have to believe me.

232
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,400
Easy does it.

233
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,200
Don't say a single word unless I say it.

234
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,200
Deviate a single word, and I will kill you.

235
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,300
Don't try to send them any secret messages or codes.

236
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,300
Do you understand?

237
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,600
Codes?

238
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,700
Do you understand?!

239
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
Yes, yes. All right, all right.

240
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,200
Yes?

241
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,900
He wants to know who you are.

242
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,500
He wants to know who just arrived.

243
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,400
Tell him it's someone who can help resolve the situation.

244
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,200
He says it's someone who can resolve the situation.

245
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,900
What part of the government do you work for?

246
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,700
I never said I was with the government.

247
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,200
The less he says, the more mysterious we seem

248
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,000
the higher an authority we become.

249
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,800
What part of--aah!

250
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
What part of the government...

251
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,200
Don't hurt her.

252
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,900
Ask who they work for.

253
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,100
No, ask if they're NSA.

254
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,700
No, ask--

255
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,100
They're FBI, aren't they?

256
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Are you FBI?

257
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,700
He can ask me himself.

258
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,200
He says you can ask him yourself.

259
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,600
Tell me who you are, or this agent dies!

260
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,500
You know who I am.

261
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,900
If you're the higher authority

262
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,000
then you can have it removed.

263
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,400
That'll take some time.

264
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,000
I want it removed now.

265
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,900
You know...

266
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,600
You know it can't be done that quickly.

267
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Good-bye.

268
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,900
No! Wait! Ok.

269
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,300
All right.

270
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,100
One hour.

271
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,000
You have one hour to remove it

272
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,100
or I swear to god, I'll kill every agent on this train.

273
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,800
It? He wants it removed?

274
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,200
Do you know what it is?

275
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,900
No.

276
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,800
We just bought an hour, though, to figure it out.

277
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,600
We have 40 minutes left.

278
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,700
Reid, is there a delusion more common than others

279
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,500
to a paranoid mind in a psychotic episode?

280
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,600
Delusions are as varied as the people that have them.

281
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
They're colored by personal experience.

282
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,700
You can't turn back now, Ted.

283
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,400
They won't ever stop hounding you and following you and--

284
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,900
I'm doing it! Leave me alone!

285
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,900
Any of you guys have a cell phone with service?

286
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,400
We're in the middle of nowhere. Welcome to texas.

287
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,300
You're bleeding more than you
should be from a cut this small.

288
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,900
Thin blood.

289
00:17:55,900 --> 00:18:00,900
The agents outside need to know what it is that he wants removed.

290
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,200
He thinks the government is watching him, monitoring him.

291
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,700
They monitor all of us.

292
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,200
They have ways of finding out everything you do.

293
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,800
Don't be stupid.

294
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,700
There's an FBI agent on board.

295
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,900
You think that's a coincidence?

296
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,400
I'm doing it!

297
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,600
He's going to kill us, isn't he?

298
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,300
No.

299
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,800
He killed that security guard.

300
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,500
The security guard had a gun. He felt threatened by him.

301
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,100
Uhh! It's so hot!

302
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:29,400
You took hostages in the middle of Texas. Of course it's hot.

303
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,800
No!

304
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,000
That's exactly what they want, Ted.

305
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
They want to divert you from having it removed.

306
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,500
You're close to having it removed.

307
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,100
His arm.

308
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,700
What?

309
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,600
Look at his arm.

310
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,500
What is that?

311
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,200
They look like scars.

312
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,100
The places he tried to dig it out with a razor or a pen.

313
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,400
Dig what out?

314
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,500
Maybe a microchip?

315
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,900
Oh, man. It's almost as common a delusion as claiming to be the new Messiah.

316
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,200
Ralph Tortorici held an entire classroom hostage

317
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,600
because he believed microchips had been implanted in his body.

318
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,100
Wait a minute.

319
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,200
This guy thinks he has some kind of device stuck in his arm?

320
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,400
Probably, and if we don't take it out, he's gonna kill somebody.

321
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,000
Yeah. This is Morgan.

322
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,300
I got your names.

323
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,000
Ok, Garcia, talk to me.

324
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,500
Skinny guy in the suit is Harry Anderson.

325
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:40,900
The young guy is a former Gillett university undergrad.

326
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,600
The girl is Elaine Curtis, from--get this--

327
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,400
Adobe Walls in Tirlingua, Texas.

328
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,500
The lady in the nice suit is Linda Deaton

329
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,200
author and renowned psychiatrist.

330
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,300
Penelope, you are truly amazing.

331
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,400
Yeah. Not so fast.

332
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,300
I've got your bonus answer, too.

333
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,200
Your hostage taker, he's famous, academically speaking.

334
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,900
His name is Bryar, Dr. Theodore Bryar.

335
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,900
Ok. You know what?

336
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,300
Send it all to me right now. Keep digging.

337
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,000
Penelope, nice work.

338
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,200
Tell me about the hostages.

339
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,500
Ok. Let's see.

340
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,700
First we've got Harry Anderson.

341
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,100
He's a paper goods salesman.

342
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,800
Lived in a small home just outside of Dallas

343
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,300
for 18 years with his wife.

344
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:23,300
He's got no children, no investments, no company retirement portfolio.

345
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,100
He doesn't take chances.

346
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,400
So, what about the kid?

347
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,100
Kid's name--Josh Patel. He's 20 years old.

348
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,700
He just got expelled from Gillett university

349
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,900
for driving his car into the library building drunk.

350
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,700
He's drinking now, and we don't need a drunk in there.

351
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,200
Ok. The girl-- we don't have a lot to go on.

352
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,100
Nothing more than her driver's license.

353
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,000
Her name's Elaine Curtis.

354
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,200
She lives in a small town in west Texas.

355
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,600
She's got no credit cards, no passport.

356
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,700
Doesn't look like she travels much at all.

357
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,500
This is Dr. Linda Deaton.

358
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,300
She's a psychiatrist at stokes mental health center in El Paso.

359
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,200
That's where Ted Bryar's been living for the last 9 years.

360
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,100
His doctor?

361
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,400
I say probably.

362
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,200
She's unmarried, lives in El Paso.

363
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,400
She's written several books and papers

364
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,200
mainly published in medical circles.

365
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,700
She's a popular lecturer.

366
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,000
She's scheduled to speak at several symposiums this year

367
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,300
and tonight in Dallas.

368
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,200
That's it. That's all I got.

369
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,300
Garcia's in the process of looking deeper

370
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:19,300
but I don't really see how this lineup's gonna be much of a help to us, Gideon.

371
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,200
Well, let's just hope none of them makes the situation worse.

372
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:31,000
They're messing with you out there, Ted.

373
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,700
Trying to weaken you.

374
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,400
You need resolve.

375
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:42,800
Hey, why aren't they helping us?

376
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,700
We're gonna get through this just fine.

377
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,700
We? He isn't pissed at us.

378
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,100
You're the government agent.

379
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,800
He probably thinks we're all agents.

380
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,000
He believes almost everyone is.

381
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,600
I'm not with any government agent.

382
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,800
He's trying to confuse you.

383
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,500
I'm with you. Big brother, right?

384
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:04,400
New-think? New-speak? Hate is love. War is peace.

385
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,700
He's laughing at you.

386
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,100
Stop it!

387
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,400
No, Ted, it's ok. He doesn't mean anything.

388
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,700
Yeah, chill. I support you.

389
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,000
Screw the government.

390
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,100
Let him sit down.

391
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,800
All right, how do we remove a microchip that's not there?

392
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:40,800
His speech is lucid.

393
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,500
There's no sign of neologisms,
word salad, or loosening of associations.

394
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,100
As long as he can systemize

395
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,300
he'll be able to keep his thinking relatively organized.

396
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,700
Organized enough to see through any game we try to throw at him?

397
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,100
And if he's convinced it's in his arm

398
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,200
and not in a place like his lower back or his neck...

399
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,300
an incision means he's gonna be watching.

400
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,300
Maybe we can just convince him that he's been looking in the wrong place.

401
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,900
Or we could fake it.

402
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:07,900
Conceal a chip in the palm, a little sleight of hand.

403
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:08,500
Oh, come on, Reid

404
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,600
what are you talking about? A magic trick?

405
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,000
Yeah, I'm talking about a magic trick.

406
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:11,700
No.

407
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,100
I used to do it during college exams.

408
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,300
I can make it appear, I can make it disappear.

409
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,600
We can't risk giving him another agent as a hostage.

410
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,000
We have to do something.

411
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,300
All right, Reid.

412
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,800
Let's go. Teach it to me.

413
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,400
What? No.

414
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,800
Look, if you can do it, I can do it. Show it to me.

415
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,000
I've been practicing this my whole life.

416
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,900
We have less than 30 minutes.

417
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:32,200
Reid, I am not about to let you get on that train with an armed psychotic.

418
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,400
We don't have any other choice, do we?

419
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,400
No.

420
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,600
We don't have any other choice.

421
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,400
Dr. Bryar's definitely one of the top physicists in the world.

422
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:51,100
He's written hundreds of papers on m-theory.

423
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,600
I don't understand any of it.

424
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,500
Oh, he worked for the government for several years in the eighties.

425
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Probably the source of his delusions.

426
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,500
He's been institutionalized for the past 9 years.

427
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,600
Till Dr. Deaton took him on a field trip.

428
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,200
What we need is a strategy.

429
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,000
I'll try to talk to him.

430
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,400
You think that's wise?

431
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,700
Ted?

432
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,200
You feel a little bit better now?

433
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
You're in no danger here.

434
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,800
These people don't want to hurt you.

435
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,500
Sure they don't.

436
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,300
The FBI agent just happened to be on the train today.

437
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,800
She wasn't following you, wasn't watching you.

438
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
She expects you to believe that?

439
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:47,300
Let them go, Ted. I'll stay with you.

440
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:51,500
You and I will do this together

441
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,300
only you need to let these people go.

442
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,200
I will wait with you.

443
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,500
No one wants to hurt you.

444
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,200
We don't want to hurt you.

445
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,400
We want to kill you.

446
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,300
No!

447
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,500
No, it's ok, Ted! Ted, it's ok!

448
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,300
Don't!

449
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,800
I'll make sure that they never take it out of you.

450
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,700
If you hurt one more person on this train

451
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:19,200
I swear to god, I'll make them leave it in you forever.

452
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
What?

453
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,900
Everything all right in there, Dr. Bryar?

454
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,100
I want it out.

455
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,000
I'm sending 2 technicians in to remove it.

456
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,700
No! One. One technician.

457
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,300
Well, it's a delicate procedure. It requires--

458
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,900
one technician!

459
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,000
Or every agent on this train dies!

460
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,200
Ok. You need to relax. We still have 20 minutes.

461
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,100
Not anymore.

462
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,700
I want it out now.

463
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,700
Right now!

464
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
Now!

465
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,200
I don't know about this.

466
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,800
It'll look better when it's covered.

467
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
With what?

468
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,900
Blood.

469
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,000
Reid, do not take this vest off.

470
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,200
In hostage situations

471
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,800
S.W.A.T. sometimes won't even tell the negotiator

472
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,700
when they're deciding to go in.

473
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,900
Do you know why that is?

474
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,500
'Cause the slightest change in tone of voice

475
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,400
or choice of words can give the whole thing away.

476
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,300
That's right. Don't make eye contact with Elle.

477
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,100
You're a technician. You've never seen her before.

478
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,800
Got it.

479
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,700
Now remember, play into the guy's fantasy. Believe it yourself.

480
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,200
Actually, did you know that dentists and surgeons

481
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,200
have been recruited to secretly implant these
during otherwise normal medical procedures?

482
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,800
This has been happening on and off since the late 1930s.

483
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,000
You told me to believe.

484
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,600
Heh heh! Let's go.

485
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,400
All right. One government-issued microchip.

486
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,100
You gotta relax, man.

487
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,000
The chip's a lot smaller than I'm used to doing it with, all right?

488
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,800
I'm pulling the plug on this.

489
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,100
No, no, hold on.

490
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,700
One more.

491
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,700
Take his chip out. Then get off the train. You understand?

492
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,300
Tell him you need to get back to the higher authority.

493
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:31,100
Say you have guidelines to follow, whatever.

494
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,500
Do not stay in there with him. That's an order.

495
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
Yes, sir.

496
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,100
Could you guys do me a favor?

497
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
Anything.

498
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,100
Could at least one of you look like you're gonna see me again?

499
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,100
See you when you get back.

500
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,400
Tell your men to get whatever target they can.

501
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,200
If this starts to go bad, we're gonna go in.

502
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,100
Probably not gonna have a great shot.

503
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,000
Take the one they can get.

504
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,700
That's far enough, Ted.

505
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,000
That's far enough.

506
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,300
Hello, everyone.

507
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:07,100
I'm here to remove a chip from Dr. Bryar.

508
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Check him out.

509
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,000
Take the vest off. I want to see you.

510
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,000
I don't have any weapons.

511
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,900
The higher authority doesn't authorize it for technicians.

512
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,200
Take it off!

513
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,700
Damn it, Reid, I said don't take the vest off.

514
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,300
Come closer.

515
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,400
I want to see both of your hands at all times.

516
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,700
Sit across from me.

517
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,100
Why are you so nervous?

518
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,900
I told you. I'm not used to being around guns.

519
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,600
This is going to probably sting a little bit.

520
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Did you see that?

521
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,100
I knew it.

522
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,500
I knew it.

523
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,600
Hey, look, he's got it. He's got the chip.

524
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,600
I've got to go to the higher authority--

525
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,600
Not yet!

526
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,900
Turn it on.

527
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,900
Turn the chip on.

528
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,000
Excuse me?

529
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
Get off the train, Reid.

530
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,200
No. Something's wrong.

531
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,700
Get off the train.

532
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,100
Get out of there.

533
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,600
Why isn't he moving?

534
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,500
How many shots would it take to move in?

535
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,700
Two. First blows the windows.

536
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,600
Second takes Bryar down.

537
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,700
And he'll be shooting after the windows go.

538
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,300
That's the best we can do.

539
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,600
All right. Standby.

540
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,000
Turn it on, or I pull the trigger.

541
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:30,400
I can't turn it on.

542
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,200
Why not?

543
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,900
Because it has to be implanted.

544
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:34,800
She's right.

545
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,500
The chip derives its power from tiny electrical impulses fired between neurons.

546
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
It has to be in your skin to work.

547
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,800
I--I really got to go--

548
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,100
sit down! You're not going anywhere.

549
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:57,000
See? Dude actually had a chip in his arm.

550
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,000
All right, it seems calm for now.

551
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,600
Reid's still on the train.

552
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,600
Now we have 2 agents in there.

553
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,300
It's probably the higher authority.

554
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,300
I told you I have protocols to follow.

555
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:25,500
I was supposed to go right back out there. I--I have rules.

556
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,800
Answer the phone.

557
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,200
You want me to stay, I'm obviously going to stay

558
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,500
but, I mean, you're going to be the one that has to explain it to the man.

559
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,100
Ooh, the man?

560
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,100
They're still trying to tell you what to do, Ted.

561
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,600
Why can't you all just leave me alone?

562
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,600
Leave you alone?

563
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,700
Stay out of this.

564
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,300
No. The government does watch us.

565
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,400
You got microwaves and satellites.

566
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,600
I'm with you, man.

567
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,000
Do not agitate him.

568
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,600
Screw you.

569
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,600
Dr. Bryar, answer the phone.

570
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,600
My old man used to have tracking devices in his cars.

571
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,300
He said it was for theft

572
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,900
but it's so he could find out where I'd go.

573
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,300
And what about personal recordings and televisions?

574
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,100
You don't think someone's monitoring everything you watch?

575
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:16,400
You know how many patents are issued for devices to monitor people?

576
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,000
Look it up, man.

577
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:18,700
Here he comes, Ted.

578
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:21,000
He's the agent who's playing the hero.

579
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,600
Answer the phone, Ted.

580
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,900
Stop. This isn't going to help.

581
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,200
What the hell do you know?

582
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,900
Ted, he doesn't know what he's talking about. He's just a kid.

583
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,300
Who you calling a kid?

584
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,500
Sit down.

585
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,000
Oh, now you're gonna tell me what to do?

586
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,900
He'd only have one gun if you weren't here.

587
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:36,800
I'm with you, man.

588
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,900
He's not with us, Ted. He's not with us at all.

589
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:41,900
Answer the phone, Dr. Bryar. It's the higher authority.

590
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,300
They're coming for you, Ted.

591
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,800
No!

592
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,200
Teddy?

593
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:52,100
Oh, damn. Damn!

594
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,700
What?

595
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,700
What happened, Ted?

596
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,100
I did what you sked for.

597
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,800
I'm tired.

598
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,600
I've been fighting you for so long.

599
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,100
You don't have to fight anymore.

600
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,800
He's a liar, Ted.

601
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,800
I said it all ends today.

602
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:34,700
Me, these agents--it all ends today.

603
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,000
What does that mean?

604
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,900
It means he's decided on an end game.

605
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,600
He's going to kill himself and the hostages.

606
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,900
Ted...

607
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,800
No one on this train is an agent but me.

608
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,500
No one else.

609
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,100
I'm the only one. You can let everybody else go.

610
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,500
I don't think so, Ted, do you?

611
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,100
Dr. Bryar, we need to get this woman help.

612
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,700
Who's going to help me?

613
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,600
The higher authorities can help you.

614
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,200
They're not what you think. They're not the enemy.

615
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,500
They can help you, Dr. Bryar.

616
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,300
Not anymore.

617
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,800
Let me know when HRT is ready.

618
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,300
Gideon, you send those guys in there

619
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,700
hostages are going to die.

620
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,900
Yeah. If we don't do something

621
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,300
they're going to die anyway.

622
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,800
It's not gone.

623
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,400
I know.

624
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:18,900
Well, you just said when the chip came out, it would go away.

625
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,300
I--I still hear it.

626
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,800
Then there must be more of them.

627
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,900
But you said it was the only one, Leo.

628
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,300
I can still...

629
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,800
feel the buzzing, the burning.

630
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:34,400
Dr. Bryar.

631
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,300
What?

632
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,100
Reid!

633
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,500
It's all right, Elle.

634
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,000
Is there another one?

635
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,400
You know there isn't.

636
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,900
If there were, Leo would've told you.

637
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,500
Don't listen, Ted.

638
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,600
Make it stop!

639
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,700
Most people say that m-theory can never be proved

640
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,500
because the mathematical tools do not yet exist.

641
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,800
Don't push him.

642
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,200
But you see it, right?

643
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,300
Am I right?

644
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:12,400
You can see the different strings unifying the dimensions

645
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,700
the gravitational infinities canceling each other out.

646
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:18,000
You see them, right, Dr. Bryar?

647
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,300
You see them because you have the tools.

648
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,800
Your mind is that tool.

649
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,900
He's one of them, Ted, one of them.

650
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,000
Shut up!

651
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,300
This has gone on too long. I'm going in.

652
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,300
And I have to believe that if you put your mind to it

653
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:40,300
you'll realize that only you can make Leo stop.

654
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,800
You can make him stop by understanding him

655
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,600
by understanding that he is a liar

656
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,500
and he only wants bad things for you.

657
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,300
I need to believe that, Dr. Bryar.

658
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:51,000
I said kill him, Ted!

659
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,300
I had to.

660
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,800
He was going to kill us.

661
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,200
I had to. God forgive me.

662
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,000
We need an ambulance.

663
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:34,900
I'm sorry.

664
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,500
It's a little late for all that.

665
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,800
You going to the hospital?

666
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,600
I'm going to ride in with the psychiatrist.

667
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
See you over there.

668
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,500
She going to be all right?

669
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,900
Yeah, I think so.

670
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,400
Gideon, will you tell him that I
don't need to go to the hospital?

671
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,800
Regulations are regulations.

672
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,500
You're all right?

673
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,600
Yeah, I'm fine, dad.

674
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,400
Elle?

675
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,200
Yeah?

676
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,500
Don't ever call me dad again.

677
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,400
What do you think he'd feel about mom?

678
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,300
Let me know when you're going to do that so I can run.

679
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,100
Um, Reid, you probably saved my life in there.

680
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:18,400
Probably? I totally saved your life.

681
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,600
And I'm pretty certain that it was caught on tape.

682
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,500
You know, what you said in there to Bryar?

683
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:28,900
That you know what it's like?

684
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,500
The guy was a delusional psychotic.

685
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,100
I was playing into his fantasy.

686
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,900
Go to the hospital. I'll see you there, all right?

687
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:49,000
Albert Einstein asked "a question that sometimes drives me hazy--

688
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,100
am I or the others crazy?"

689
