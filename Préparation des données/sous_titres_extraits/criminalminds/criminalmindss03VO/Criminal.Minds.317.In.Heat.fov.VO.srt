1
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,300
I turned
the breaker off.

2
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:13,700
Kevin,
you scared me.

3
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,300
It's becoming
your thing.

4
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,900
Well, maybe you
scare too easily.

5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,900
What--
What's this?

6
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:22,000
Oh, since you couldn't
make it to dinner,

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,500
I thought i would
bring dinner to you.

8
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:29,700
Oh, kevin...
oh...

9
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,500
Want to start
with dessert?

10
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,900
Oh, i always said
i wanted to try this

11
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,200
When i was a grownup.

12
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,900
You're
too stressed out.

13
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,000
What?

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,700
You're too
stressed out.

15
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,900
You didn't like that?

16
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,600
No. That's why you
scare so easily.

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,100
You're so stressed.

18
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,800
I have
a stressful job.

19
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,300
You know, maybe
we should get away.

20
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
You mean,
like a vacation?
Yeah. Yeah.

21
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,300
You deserve a week
in the land
of no keyboards.

22
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,600
I don't know what
i'd do with myself.

23
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,700
Well, i can think of

24
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,700
A couple of things.

25
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,800
That is something else
i have always wanted to try.

26
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:15,500
Mm, oh, my husband
would kill us both.

27
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,200
No. Don't think
of him.

28
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,900
Mi linda. Preciosa.
Oh, my god...

29
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,100
Hermosa.
Oh, god...

30
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,000
Oh...oh, my god.

31
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,200
Oh, god.

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,300
Charles luvet was found floating
in a miami marina last night.

33
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,500
Local m.E. Thinks that
he was only in the water
about an hour.

34
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,900
Any attempt
to weigh the body down?

35
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,900
Doesn't
appear to be.

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,800
The dumping
could be convenient,

37
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,400
As a opposed to a means
of hiding the crime.

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,300
Well, he's the third victim
found in miami over
the last two months.

39
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,400
Though the locations
of the bodies are different,

40
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,200
Many of the elements are
the same--All males,

41
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,400
25 to 35, all traveling,
all asphyxiated

42
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,500
With no signs
of sexual assault.

43
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,700
But tourists
could be just
simple robbery.

44
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,500
Well, there are some
personal items missing.

45
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,600
He's targeting
travelers
for a reason.

46
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,100
I'm so sorry.

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,200
Hey,
half-Day today?

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,800
Alarm, sir.
I overslept.
I'm so sorry.

49
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,600
Everyone's allowed
to be late...once.

50
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,900
It won't
happen again.

51
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,800
You guys notice the red flag
on the autopsy report?

52
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,200
Yeah. None
of the hyoid bones
were fractured.

53
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
No visual signs of trauma.
No ligature marks.

54
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,800
Yet, the unsub still
managed to asphyxiate
grown men.

55
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,300
Maybe a chokehold,

56
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,900
Wouldn't leave
any signs of trauma.

57
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,500
It would also be a way
of controlling a male.

58
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,100
A powerful grip from behind
gives the unsub
all the leverage.

59
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:42,400
None of these victims
look out-Of-Shape
or easy to control.

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,000
In fact, they all look
remarkably fit.

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,500
Well, as i said, the recovery locations
are very different.

62
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,100
Charles luvet was found
in the water.

63
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:52,300
Daniel brown was
partially buried in
the shallow sand dune.

64
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,100
Paul hayes was stuffed
into a dumpster.

65
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:56,400
That's not much of an effort to hide
any of them.

66
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,400
They were all found
in high-Traffic areas.

67
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,800
Miami pd
is asking for our help,

68
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,700
Considering
there are currently
4 other men missing

69
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,200
That match
this victimology.

70
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,800
I can dig up what i can on the victims
from their hometowns.

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Hotch: miami is a mecca
for potential targets,

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,500
And anyone traveling
is more vulnerable
than they normally would be.

73
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,400
Jareau: case in point,
charles luvet,
the latest victim,

74
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,800
He was
a vacationing cop.

75
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,900
Http://www.Ragbear.Com

76
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,300
O secrets
better kept

77
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,500
Than the secrets
that everybody guesses."

78
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,000
George bernard shaw.

79
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,300
Ugh...agh. Is it always
this hot?

80
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,400
Every day,
all day.

81
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,100
That's
south beach.

82
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,300
That's not what
i'm talking about.

83
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,100
They know.

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,300
Fbi.
Yes.

85
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,600
Detective lopez,
miami pd.

86
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,000
Oh, um, morgan...

87
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,000
Derek.
Tina.

88
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,800
So, thank you for
coming down so quickly.

89
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,800
Agent jareau--Jj.
We spoke
on the phone

90
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,700
Yes.

91
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:28,400
These are agents
hotchner, prentiss,

92
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,000
Rossi, derek,
and dr. Reid.

93
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,700
Well, i hope there's no test
because i'm lousy with names.

94
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,000
Agent
will be fine.

95
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,400
Hey,
isn't that--

96
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,200
Detective lamontagne
just arrived from new orleans

97
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,900
To i.D. The cop they pulled
from the bay last night.

98
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,500
Detective, it's good
to see you.

99
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,700
How are you? Yeah.

100
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,000
Charlie luvet and i
worked together
for 7 years.

101
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,100
We haven't formally
i.D.Ed him yet,

102
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,900
But we believe
it's him.

103
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
Sorry for
your loss, man.

104
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,600
So, you all
know each other?

105
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
Professionally.

106
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,600
Yeah. The bau helped me out
on a case about a year ago.

107
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,700
Just for
the sake of clarity,
i'm not here to investigate.

108
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,300
Charlie was supposed
to be married this august,

109
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,600
So if the guy
that floated up
last night was him,

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,900
I guess i have the honor
of notifying his fiancee,

111
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,200
So she's gonna need
some answers, closure,

112
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,600
And i'm just here
to get that for her.

113
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,100
Do you know
why he was here?

114
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,300
He was meeting up
with some college buddies

115
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,800
To compete
in a regatta.

116
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,500
He was a big boat guy.

117
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,900
So, he wasn't
traveling alone.

118
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,600
Well, he came alone.
He was meeting them here.

119
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,800
We should track these friends down, see
if they saw anything.

120
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,300
And the 2 other victims,
any potential witnesses?

121
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,900
No. Paul hayes
was here alone on business.

122
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:46,400
Daniel brown came down
to windsurf by himself.

123
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,300
So, they were all
essentially alone.

124
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,200
Prentiss:
the unsub watched them
long enough to know that.

125
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,500
Yeah. He's probably
already scoping out
his next victim,

126
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,800
And i don't have
a damn thing
to warn people with,

127
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,000
So come on inside.
I've got everything
all set up.

128
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,000
How are you,
lamontagne?
Good to see you.

129
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Lamontagne:
hey, wait up.

130
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:11,400
What was that?

131
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,500
What was what?

132
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,800
"Professionally"?

133
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,500
Hey, you still haven't
told anyone about us?

134
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,600
It's none
of their business.

135
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,100
Where do you tell them
you go every weekend?

136
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,300
I don't.

137
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,500
Are you ashamed
or something?

138
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,800
What? No. No.

139
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,900
It's just
in this team,

140
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,500
Everyone
knows everything
about everyone.

141
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,700
There's no privacy.

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,200
My personal life is
one less thing

143
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,300
They can profile,
all right?

144
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,300
We should
get up there.
Yeah.

145
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,400
Wouldn't want your team
to think something is up,
would we?

146
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Please don't
do this, ok?

147
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:50,100
You realize that
this is gonna happen
every now and then

148
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,800
When our career paths
cross, right?

149
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
Doesn't make it
any less awkward.

150
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,200
Ok. Well, never realized
how much awkward

151
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,000
Could sound like ashamed.

152
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,200
This is
everything we recovered
from paul hayes' hotel room.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's all been processed,
so don't worry about
touching anything.

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,800
Thank you.

155
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm gonna take
the skinny kid and derek
to the dump sites,

156
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,100
So i got my cell,
radio.

157
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,700
If anyone doesn't give you
anything, just call me.

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,800
Great.

159
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,600
She did say
she wasn't good at names.

160
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,900
Remembered derek.

161
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,000
Wonder how
she'll describe us.

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,500
Oh, i am sure i
don't want to know.

163
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, it's always sad
seeing someone's
life reduced

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,400
To the things
they had with them
when they died.

165
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
It's just so clear
they didn't know

166
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,100
How short
their time would be.

167
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,800
Odd.
Odd?

168
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,500
His wife reported that
he'd been down here

169
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,900
Almost a week
on business,

170
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,700
Yet he never wore any
of the suits he packed.

171
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,900
Hmm, and there
are appointments

172
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,800
Going back 6 months
in his pda,

173
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,300
But nothing is
listed for the week
he was here.

174
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,800
Hayes was wearing
running clothes
when he was killed.

175
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,700
Who takes off
their wedding ring to jog?

176
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,600
Yeah.

177
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,300
That's him.
That's charlie luvet.

178
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,200
Woman: we had to i.D.
More than the photo
before we could ship him.

179
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,500
You're not family,
but i can cut through
the red tape.

180
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,500
Thank you.

181
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
Do you need help
making arrangements?

182
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,300
Liaising with families
is part of what i do.

183
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,100
I might just
take you up on that.

184
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,900
Excuse me.
I'll be outside.

185
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,600
Paul hayes was found
in a dumpster over there.

186
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,100
Hey, i think these guys
knew the unsub.

187
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,300
What makes you
say that?

188
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,200
Where you're
a fish out of water,
you look to locals

189
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,700
For where to eat,
where to shop...

190
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,500
What path to run.
Yeah.
Why would he kill them

191
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,800
And then risk dragging
their body across the beach?

192
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He wouldn't.
They were already
out here.

193
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,500
So they've already
dusted for prints.

194
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,600
I sure would feel better
if we found his gun
and shield.

195
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,400
I'm thinking if somebody
tried to grab him up here,

196
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,300
He might have left them
behind, you know?

197
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,100
Charlie left the hotel
voluntarily.

198
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,700
What makes you
say that?

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,900
Because we'd know
if the valet had
his car downstairs.

200
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,700
This is a receipt
for a mercury sable
he rented.

201
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,700
You know,
most rental cars have
locators in them.

202
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,200
I'll call garcia,
see if she can find out
where it is right now.

203
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,900
Don't.

204
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,300
Standing in
my dead partner's room,

205
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,800
And you think
i'm in the mood
for grab-Ass, huh?

206
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,300
What's that?

207
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,700
Plastic i.D. Bracelet.

208
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,500
11257 on it.

209
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm guessing
it's for the regatta.

210
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,700
Hey, i'm sorry.

211
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,200
Mi puo indicare

212
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,900
Il fegato sulla cartina?

213
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,300
You just asked me
to show you where
your liver is on a map.

214
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,400
Did i?

215
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,100
Pretty sure
"il fegato" is liver.

216
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,300
Oh, try this one.
[Clears throat]

217
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,300
"Vorrei una camera

218
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,400
Con letto matrimoniale."

219
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,900
Hmm, what
does that mean?

220
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,500
"I'd like to book
a room with a double bed."

221
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,200
Oh, jinkies,

222
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,700
Even lechery sounds
better in italian.

223
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,200
Buongiorno,
signor hotchner.

224
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,500
You are correct.

225
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,100
Most rentals do have
a locator system in them.

226
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,900
Got it.

227
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,200
I'm sure
i can have this car
located in a jiff.

228
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,400
Prego.

229
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,900
All clear, detective.
Thanks, guys.

230
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,000
This garcia girl
of yours is good.

231
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,200
That's
an understatement

232
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,900
Hey, you can't go
wrong with a latina
at the controls.

233
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,000
Yeah. That's my girl,
but she's not nearly

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,500
As latino
as her name sounds.

235
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,800
If i'm gonna
kill someone,

236
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Taking them out on
a boat would give me
the most privacy.

237
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,800
Then there's
harbor masters
and videotapes,

238
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,000
But that's--I mean,
that will take weeks
to get back,

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,100
And we don't have
weeks, right?

240
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,400
No, we sure don't.
You got the keys,
don't you?

241
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,800
Oh, yeah.
Go ahead
and start it up.

242
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,600
Well, there is one good thing
about these victims
being on vacation.

243
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,500
When you're alone
in a strange place,

244
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,600
You got a rent-A-Car,

245
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,300
What's the one thing
that you need?

246
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,400
A gps.
That's right.

247
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Normally, when you
return these things,

248
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,500
They wipe
this stuff clean,

249
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,400
So that right there

250
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,900
Has to be the last place
charlie needed to go.

251
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,800
Really?

252
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,600
What, you know it?

253
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,300
That's not possible.

254
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,100
Come on.
I think i would know
if there's a regatta

255
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,800
Happening this weekend
at my own club.

256
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:54,600
Our regatta is held
in september.

257
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,500
But he said--
And i'm sorry,

258
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,600
But we wouldn't use
a plastic bracelet like
this for participants.

259
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,100
Our entry fee
is $10,000.

260
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,500
Good luck.

261
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,600
You sure that's
what he said?

262
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,300
Comes here
every year for it.

263
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,500
That's what he does
on his annual furlough.

264
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,400
Morgan.

265
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,800
Yeah. I just
got an address out of
charlie luvet's rental.

266
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,100
It's to a bar
in south beach--

267
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,600
11257 palm drive.

268
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,400
It's a gay bar, hotch.

269
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,300
I don't think
charlie luvet was
ever out here

270
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,400
To meet friends
for a race.

271
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,300
We'll have to rethink
our victimology.

272
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,100
Better watch yourself
in the sun.

273
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,400
You know what they say--
All the exposure
can kill you.

274
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,700
Suntan to death.

275
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,500
Well, i guess there's
worse ways to die.

276
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,400
As someone with
firsthand experience,

277
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,800
I can tell you
that is true.

278
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,700
Firsthand experience?

279
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Yeah.
I'm a police officer
in new orleans.

280
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,100
A cop. Really?

281
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Well, that's
impressive.

282
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,400
Where are you from?
Texas.

283
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,200
Well, you know,
they say things
are bigger there.

284
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:19,500
Oh.

285
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Well, i don't know
anything about that,
officer,

286
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,400
But how about
i buy you a drink
and we can talk about it?

287
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,300
You're not here
with anyone?
Nope.

288
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,400
Came down to miami
all by my lonesome.

289
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,900
Look at that.
Me, too.

290
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,100
I'm deac.

291
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,800
Charlie.

292
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,800
The name is charlie--
Charlie luvet.

293
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,400
For you.

294
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,500
Oh, thank you.
You read my mind.

295
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,600
I don't understand
how it can be this dry
when it's this humid.

296
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,100
Mmm.

297
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,200
Sweat
all your fluids
out outside

298
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,300
And then come
into bone-Dry
air conditioning.

299
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,000
Well, then if i could
just hook this up to an iv--

300
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,600
At least we have
something fun
to look at,

301
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Keep us on our toes.

302
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,300
What do you mean?
Lamontagne.

303
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,100
You think so, huh?

304
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,100
Don't you?

305
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,200
Yeah. I guess he's--

306
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,800
He has a thing.

307
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,900
Definitely a thing.

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,400
Detective, is that
the case file?

309
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,500
Yeah.
Thanks.

310
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,400
How'd i not know
charlie was gay?

311
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,000
Because he didn't
want you to know.

312
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,900
Flew hundreds of miles
just to be someone else.

313
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,200
No. He flew hundreds
of miles to be himself.

314
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,600
What do i tell
his fiancee?

315
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:43,300
The truth.

316
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,000
All right,

317
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
The fbi has a profile
of our guy.

318
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,100
Ok. We want to stress,
what we're about to present

319
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,800
Is just
a preliminary profile.

320
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,500
There may be
a time restraint here,

321
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,300
So we just wanted
to give you what we have now.

322
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:58,100
Our technical analyst,
penelope garcia,
will start off

323
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,800
By talking
about the 4 remaining
victims still missing.

324
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,200
Two of them
disappeared

325
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,600
On the same day
a few months ago,

326
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,200
And then the third
and the fourth went missing

327
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,700
Within the last 4 weeks.

328
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,400
We think the unsub
is targeting these guys

329
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,500
On their travels.

330
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,100
Yeah, and then when
the befriending happens,

331
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,300
Whoosh, they vanish.

332
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,000
However it looks like
there's a connection

333
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,300
Between our current victims

334
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,700
And the men
that are still missing.

335
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,800
See,
2 of those 4 missing men
were totally out,

336
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,600
Openly gay
when they disappeared.

337
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
I saw one of them
on socialcrib.Net.

338
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,400
That's
a social networking site

339
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,300
They had a photo
of his boyfriend.

340
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,000
Assuming
the 4 missing men are
meeting the same unsub,

341
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,600
It means he's killing
almost weekly,

342
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,500
Which also means
he may have already
chosen his next victim.

343
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,400
What we need
is more information
on the movements

344
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,300
Of our victims
before they met the unsub.

345
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,200
We have 3 confirmed victims
and 4 possibles.

346
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:45,600
Some of our other colleagues
are out in the community now

347
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,800
Trying to see if anyone
remembers anything
about these men.

348
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,300
It's also not just
the fact that our victims
were traveling alone

349
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,400
That left them vulnerable
to the unsub.

350
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,700
We believe they may have
been looking specifically
to meet other men.

351
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,200
Based on the ages
of the victims,

352
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,600
We're looking
for an offender
in his mid to late 20s.

353
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,500
He's familiar
with the area,

354
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,200
And he may be
offering assistance
to those who are not.

355
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,700
He studies
his victims' habits.

356
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,300
He learns
how to gain their trust.

357
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,900
This unsub is charming,
charismatic, intelligent.

358
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,700
We assume he frequents
gay establishments,

359
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,000
But he may also work at one.

360
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,200
Hotch: and,
given the technique
with which he kills,

361
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,600
He may have had prior
defense tactic training,

362
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,500
He's may be a member
of the military

363
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,700
Or recently discharged.

364
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,300
He steals their possessions,
but he doesn't pawn a thing.

365
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,700
And the fact that
he's targeting gay men

366
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,500
May mean that
this is a hate crime

367
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,600
And/or the unsub
may be struggling
with his own sexuality.

368
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,000
* i don't care
what they say *

369
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,100
* i'm gonna
do it my way *

370
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,300
Hey,
loosen up, baby.

371
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,300
Come on. You can
have a little fun.

372
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,100
Maybe you need
another shot.

373
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,500
I'll be right back.
Whoa, whoa.

374
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,800
Wait. What, was it
something i said?

375
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,200
No. No, cher.

376
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,900
Uh, what's wrong?

377
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,500
Nothing.

378
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,800
I just need
to get some air.

379
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,300
* don't care
what you say *

380
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,300
* don't believe
in miracles... *

381
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,600
Just a little time,
and i'll have some
answers for you.

382
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,000
The best thing
that you can know

383
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Is that he loved you
very much.

384
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,000
All right.
Good night.

385
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,100
Hey.

386
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,800
You know...

387
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,000
Sure is warm
in the bayou,

388
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,900
But at least
it cools down some
at night.

389
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
What, are you leaving?

390
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,700
Yeah. I'm beat.

391
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,400
Without
saying good-Bye?

392
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:09,600
I didn't know
where you were.

393
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,100
Did you look?

394
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,800
Should i be worried?

395
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,000
I mean, it doesn't take
a profiler to see

396
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
That you got
one foot out the door
in this relationship.

397
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,800
Can you just please
keep your voice down?

398
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,300
I don't care
if they hear us.

399
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,600
Hey, yo,
i'm crazy about her.

400
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,600
You know,
i don't have a problem

401
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
With people
knowing about it.

402
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,300
Well, i do.
Why?

403
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,000
Just because,
all right?

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,800
It's my business.

405
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,000
Are you ashamed
of this?

406
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,900
No.

407
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,700
Did i offend you?
No.

408
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,600
I say
something wrong?
No.

409
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,500
You seeing
another guy?
No.

410
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,700
You want to see
another guy?
No.

411
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,600
You want to break up?
Y--

412
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,500
Y-You do?

413
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,500
Yeah.

414
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Ok.

415
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,700
You supposed
to hop on a plane
every weekend forever?

416
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,600
And neither one of us
is willing to relocate, so--

417
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,600
When did we have
that discussion?

418
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,600
Well, do you?
Maybe.

419
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,400
You want to give up
your career in new orleans

420
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,200
So you can live
in quantico, virginia?

421
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:37,600
Well, i'd at least like
to have that option.

422
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,000
You know, look, jj.

423
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,500
All i'm looking for here
is an acknowledgement

424
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
To your friends
that you care about me.

425
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,800
Why? Why is that
so important to you?

426
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Why?

427
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
Have a good night, jj.

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,800
Will...

429
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,800
Look at me.

430
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,600
I'm breaking the law
with a cop.

431
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
I wouldn't
announce that.

432
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,400
I'm a bad, bad boy.

433
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,500
I'm a badass.

434
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Hee hee hoo!

435
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,400
Does that mean
you're gonna have
to handcuff me?

436
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,800
'Cause you can
handcuff me,
if you want.

437
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,800
Shut up.

438
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,400
Are you
a dirty cop,

439
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:52,900
Huh?

440
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,100
'Cause i like dirty.

441
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,500
Is that what you want?
You like dirty...

442
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,000
What are you doing?
My cop from new orleans?

443
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,100
'Cause i can do dirty.
That what you want?

444
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,800
Shut up and listen
to yourself.

445
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,700
You're disgusting.
You're filthy.

446
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,000
Jeez...

447
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,400
Ohh...

448
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
Sorry, cher. I--

449
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,600
I didn't hurt you,
did i, cher?
I'm sorry.

450
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
I thought you left.

451
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,400
You said in the profile
that the unsub was
targeting gay males,

452
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,500
Possibly due
to his struggles

453
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,200
With his own sexuality,
right?
Right.

454
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,800
Well, what if the reason
luvet let his guard down

455
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,200
Was because he could
finally be who he is--

456
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
No judgments,
no fear.

457
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,600
What if the unsub
is seeing a freedom
in his victims

458
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,500
That he wishes
he had himself?

459
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,800
Oh, that really hurt.

460
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,900
"That really hurt."

461
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,100
That ain't funny.

462
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,800
"That ain't funny."

463
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,400
What are you doing?
What, are you making fun
of me now?

464
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,300
No, no, cher.

465
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,700
I'm not making fun
of you.

466
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,000
Hey, hey, i'm sorry.

467
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,200
Sorry.

469
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,800
For which thing?

470
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,000
For this.

471
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,800
Ugh!

472
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,600
You can take him away.

473
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,500
What have we got?

474
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,400
Male,
the same age range,

475
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,500
And we found
luvet's police badge

476
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,000
About a half a block
from here.

477
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,500
So, the unsub either
ditched it or dropped it

478
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
When he was getting away.

479
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,400
Any sign of luvet's gun?
No.

480
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,800
He may be
holding on to that.

481
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,400
Why would he kill
out on the open like this?

482
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,800
He's losing control
emotionally.

483
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,900
He could be
devolving.

484
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,400
Leaving the body
out in plain sight?

485
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,600
It's off pattern.

486
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,700
He was
interrupted.

487
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,000
Who interrupted him?

488
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,300
Bring him over.
Bus boy.
He's from the bar.

489
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,100
Mi hijito, these are
the fbi people
that i told you about,

490
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,800
So just tell them
everything you saw.

491
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,500
All right. Well,
i came out here

492
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,900
On my break
to have a smoke,

493
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,900
And that guy was
on the ground, and
his friend said--

494
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,000
His friend?

495
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,800
Yeah. His friend said
that they had
just been mugged.

496
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,200
You spoke to this guy?
No, ma'am. I tried.

497
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,000
But he did say
that he was a cop,

498
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,000
So he took off, and he
chased after those guys.

499
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,300
Could you give
a description of this cop
to a sketch artist?

500
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,400
No. I can't.

501
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,400
I mean, he was
a white guy, but it was
pretty dark out here,

502
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,500
And he basically
kept running away
from me the whole time.

503
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm gonna have to get
all your information.

504
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,000
Yeah, sure.
[Indistinct]

505
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,000
So, this guy is
impersonating luvet?

506
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,900
Could just be a ruse
he used to get away.

507
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,200
But if he is
impersonating
his victims, why?

508
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,400
Transference.

509
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,900
Hotch:
whatever he sees
in his victims,

510
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,300
He wants
for himself.

511
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,000
He hates
who he is.

512
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,500
He's targeting
tourists

513
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,800
Because he sees them
as living a kind
of lie, too.

514
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,800
Could be suffering
from cluster "b."

515
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,900
Cluster "b"?

516
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,100
A cluster of
personality disorders.

517
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:09,400
It's also called
the erratic, dramatic
emotional cluster,

518
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,600
An enduring pattern
of inner experience
and behavior

519
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,000
That differentiates
itself markedly from
the expectations

520
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Of the individual's
culture.

521
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,800
It manifests itself--
This guy's a sick dude.

522
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,500
Prentiss: but something
triggers his constant
need to escape.

523
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,000
It could be
drugs, sex,

524
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,600
Something that makes him
feel vulnerable.

525
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
And he can't
allow himself
the vulnerability.

526
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:29,200
Escape into the fantasy
protects him from ever
having to look at himself.

527
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,800
You know,
if the unsub lives
in their skin,

528
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,700
Odds are,
he's living in
their hotel rooms.

529
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,100
Any i.D.
On the body?

530
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,200
No wallet,
nothing.

531
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,700
It might have dropped.
They're searching now.

532
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,200
You're not gonna
find anything.

533
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,700
We need to roll
the prints and run them.

534
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,700
We need to figure out
who he is and where
he was staying.

535
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,400
Prints belong
to deacon rogers,
odessa, texas.

536
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,200
He's got a couple
of minor arrests--

537
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,600
One for
marijuana possession,

538
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,800
One for lewd behavior,

539
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,900
Which i'm guessing is code
for gay in texas.

540
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,900
His credit card
shows him staying at
a south beach hotel.

541
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,700
It's open.

542
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,700
Clear.

543
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,500
Boy, he tore through
this place in a hurry.

544
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,600
What was he
looking for?

545
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,400
Identity,
anything to possess
a new one.

546
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:40,600
He thinks there's
a witness out there
who can i.D. Him.

547
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,700
It's not about fulfilling
his need anymore.

548
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,900
It's about
his own survival.

549
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,300
How does he escape?

550
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,300
I'm gonna find out
if deacon rogers
had a car here.

551
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,300
Unsub: * 'cause i believe
that miracles *

552
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,900
* happen every day *

553
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,400
*i don't care
what you say *

554
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,200
*i'm gonna do it
my way *

555
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:06,900
I can pay you
gas money.

556
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,600
Aw, hell, who cares
about that, boy?

557
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,400
Just obliged
to have someone
along for the ride.

558
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,400
The sun out here
is really dangerous.

559
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,200
Dangerous, huh?
Where you from?

560
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,100
Germany.

561
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,200
Can you
say that again--
"Dangerous"?

562
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,200
Dangerous.

563
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,300
"Dangerous." Yeah.

564
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,500
Dangerous.

565
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,400
Think we
missed something?

566
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,200
I don't know.

567
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,500
Forensics pulled hair
from the sink,

568
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,600
But it'll be days
before we get results.

569
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,700
We don't have
that kind of time.

570
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,500
The unsub can't
follow his pattern.

571
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,000
He thinks
there might have been
a witness,

572
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,200
So he's gonna need
to change identities
sooner than usual.

573
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,300
What if he can't?
What do you mean?

574
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
We're predicting that
the unsub may take another
life in the next 24 hours

575
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,900
Because there was a witness
who saw him.

576
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,400
Remember what garcia said,
that specific paradigm--

577
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,600
2 victims in one day?

578
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,400
That occurred
one other time.

579
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,100
The first 2 men disappeared
on the same day.

580
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,400
Because somebody might
have seen something

581
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,900
That threatened
the unsub with
getting caught?

582
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,200
It's worth profiling.

583
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,100
Steven fitzgerald
first went missing
2 months ago,

584
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Took a bus to miami
from oakland park,

585
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,200
Which is
just up the highway,

586
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,700
Never seen again.

587
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,700
Robert feeney flew
in for a wedding

588
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,500
But never arrived
at his hotel.

589
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,200
We need to get
back in these files,

590
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,200
Question
both families.

591
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,400
Somewhere along the way,
their paths
may have crossed.

592
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,300
There's a case
we're working on

593
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,400
Which may be connected
to your son's
disappearance.

594
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,400
Is that right?

595
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,400
Unfortunately,
it's a murder case, sir.

596
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,800
Someone's attacking men
who are traveling alone.

597
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,800
This man is
attacking homosexuals.

598
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,100
Can you confirm that
your son steven is gay?

599
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,200
Why, i know he was
confused about his
sexual orientation.

600
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,400
How do you mean,
confused?

601
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,700
There were
a number of issues
he needed to sort out.

602
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,700
Was there
a friend in miami

603
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:07,400
Steven was going
to see?

604
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,100
No. He didn't
have many friends,

605
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,500
Pretty much
kept to himself.

606
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,800
So, once he got on the bus,
you never heard from him.

607
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:13,800
No.

608
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,600
You seem resigned
to this fact.

609
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,800
Wherever steven is, i trust
it's a better place for him.

610
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,300
Well, that's
a remarkable kind
of strength.

611
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,900
That's because of
my personal relationship
with the lord.

612
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,800
He gives me my strength
and my guidance.

613
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,300
And you apply
that philosophy
to your job, as well?

614
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:35,000
Well, a prison guard depends
on his instincts,

615
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,300
His skills,
and his strength.

616
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,800
Otherwise, we'd get
ourselves killed.

617
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:41,100
My faith
is my personal code.

618
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,800
Defense tactics classes
are required

619
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,500
For all employees
that the prison, right?

620
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,400
Once he got to the motel,
he was supposed to call.

621
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,600
But he never did.

622
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,200
Every time
that phone rings--

623
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,900
I know in my heart
that steven
was happy that day.

624
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,700
I swear,
it was the first time
i'd seen him smile in years.

625
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,900
He'd been talking about
taking that trip for weeks.

626
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,400
Sarah, you don't have
to justify your brother
getting on that bus.

627
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:10,600
Yes...

628
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,000
I do, 'cause...

629
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,000
It was my fault.

630
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,800
Did steven follow
in your footsteps?

631
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,700
Did he look to god for
strength and guidance?

632
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,000
My troubles with steven,

633
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
They have nothing
to do with my faith.

634
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,700
We belong to
a very tolerant church,

635
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,700
Sometimes too tolerant,
and they teach

636
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,900
That god loves everyone,
despite their failings.

637
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:34,200
And you saw
steven's homosexuality
as a failing.

638
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,800
I'm a prison guard,
and you know
how many times

639
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,300
I've walked in
on men together?

640
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,900
I had to physically
pull them apart.
It was filthy.

641
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,300
Oh, it's filthy.

642
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,800
I think he just wanted
to do it to piss me off.

643
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,600
You think your son's
sexuality was a way
to anger you?

644
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,500
I was trying to save him.
From what?

645
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,700
From himself.

646
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,200
Why would
you say that?

647
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,600
Because i gave steven
the money to go to miami.

648
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,000
Why?

649
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,500
I was trying to help him
to go somewhere else,

650
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,100
Somewhere
he could feel safe.

651
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,700
Safe from what?

652
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,800
What are you
looking for, sarah?

653
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,900
You afraid somebody
is gonna hear you?

654
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,900
Who were you protecting
your brother from,

655
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,600
Your father?

656
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,800
Was your father
hurting steven?

657
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,300
He really believes
he was doing what's right.

658
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,400
So, he did throw him
around a little bit.

659
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,200
They just--
They didn't see
eye to eye.

660
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,000
Steven couldn't
stay here anymore,

661
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,200
And i had to help him
get out.

662
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,000
Is your father
hurting you, too?

663
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,500
Never.

664
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,400
How come?

665
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,000
Because she's not
the one who's gay.

666
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,400
And how were you
trying to help him?

667
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,500
I've been a guard
for 20 years.

668
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,300
I know a little
something about
disciplining somebody.

669
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,100
So, what,
you thought

670
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,300
You could
beat homosexuality
out of him,

671
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,100
I don't like your tone.

672
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:04,800
Threatening this boy
with tactics you use
on hardened criminals,

673
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,900
Threatening him
with his own life?

674
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,400
I was teaching him
how to be a man.

675
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,000
No. You were teaching him
how to kill one.

676
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,500
You convinced him
he was worthless,

677
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,900
Contemptible for
being who he was,

678
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,000
And he believed you,
so he found a way

679
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,500
To become
someone else,
anyone else.

680
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:21,700
Steven isn't missing, sir.
He's the offender
we're looking for.

681
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,200
10-4. Send that information
to my office.

682
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,900
Texas plates.

683
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,900
Deacon rogers
never rented a car.

684
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,100
He drove here from texas
in this.

685
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,800
Put it out as a bolo.

686
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,400
Agent hotchner
is taking statements

687
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
From the family
of steven fitzgerald.

688
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,900
He might be our unsub.

689
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,200
Seriously?

690
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,800
It's an unusual
household.

691
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,600
We've had his picture
this whole time?

692
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,600
Apparently.

693
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,800
Didn't know soon enough
to prevent this.

694
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,500
One set
of tire tracks in,
nothing out.

695
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,700
Yeah, i noticed.

696
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,900
County spotted the vehicle
20 minutes ago just as-Is.

697
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,500
Asphyxiated?
Heh.

698
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,100
Why mess with a good thing?
It's clearly working
for him.

699
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:07,100
Prentiss: this stretch of road
takes you out of the city.

700
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,500
If we lose steven now,
it could take us months
to catch up with him again.

701
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,400
May i?

702
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,400
Knock yourself out.

703
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,000
What is it?

704
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,600
Some kind
of scraps of paper.

705
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,300
Looks like
a fast-Food wrapper.

706
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,100
It's a receipt
for a youth hostel.

707
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,100
It's dated
last night.

708
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,500
The name on it is
michael aldridge.

709
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,600
From the looks
of his sunburn,

710
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,700
It's a good guess
this young man
was hitchhiking.

711
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,800
Assuming steven
has taken over
michael's identity,

712
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,300
He didn't drive?
Not if michael didn't.

713
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,800
He's not becoming
his victims by choice.
It's his illness.

714
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,400
He'd have to travel
the exact same way.

715
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,800
Hostels.

716
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
There's a few hostels
in north miami beach,

717
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:51,200
4 miles that way,
and in seneca,
5 miles west.

718
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:52,200
Ok. We'll
have to split up.

719
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,100
We'll take seneca.
You take
north miami beach.

720
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,600
Michael aldridge
checked in an hour ago.

721
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,800
What room
did you put him in?

722
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,400
It's like a day room
kind of thing,

723
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,600
Like a dormitory.

724
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,600
A dormitory
full of kids?

725
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,700
It's pretty full.

726
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,300
Lopez, slow down.

727
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,600
The rest of my team
is on their way.
We should wait.

728
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,900
Look. I got a nut
with a gun in
a hostel full of kids.

729
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,300
If you want
to wait, wait.

730
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,500
Let's go.

731
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,400
Get them
out of here.

732
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,300
Fbi. Nobody move.
Nobody panic.

733
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,900
Looking
for steven fitzgerald.

734
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,200
You two, go.
Get out of here. Go.

735
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,400
Looking for steven,
steven fitzgerald.

736
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,400
Steven?

737
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,900
All of you,
get out of here. Go.
Now. Move. Let's go.

738
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,900
Now. Let's go.

739
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,100
Steven?

740
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,600
You, out.

741
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,700
Steven!

742
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,300
Michael?
Michael aldridge?

743
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,800
Michael.
Yes?

744
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,400
What--What is this?
What do you want?

745
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,100
I want you to put
that bag down.

746
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,200
I just want
to talk to you.

747
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,400
But i have done nothing.

748
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,800
I didn't do anything.
I know. I know.

749
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,600
There's nothing in that
bag you need, michael.

750
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,100
I just want
some information.

751
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,100
I need to find steven.

752
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,800
My name is michael.
I do not know steven.

753
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,900
Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
No. I don't know steven.

754
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,100
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
You know where he is.

755
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,300
No. I don't know steven!
I don't know steven!

756
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,900
Why do you want steven?

757
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,200
Steven is stupid.

758
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:48,200
He's--He's disgusting!
He's filthy!

759
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,100
Steven,
listen to me.

760
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,100
Nothing is wrong
with you.

761
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,900
Nothing, man.

762
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,400
Look.
I'm gonna show you.

763
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,700
Stay with me, ok?

764
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,600
I'm gonna
put this away.
Derek...

765
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,900
Derek...
steven,
look at me.

766
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,800
Look right at me.

767
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,300
Steven,
do you remember
who sarah is?

768
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:19,500
Hmm?

769
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,300
Sarah is
your sister.

770
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Sarah is worried
about you, man.

771
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,000
My sister?
Yeah.

772
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,300
Your sister sarah.

773
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,900
Steven,
she loves you.

774
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,800
She wants you
to stop running.

775
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,300
Sarah.
Yeah.

776
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,400
Steven, it's ok.
Put that bag down.

777
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,400
I didn't do
anything wrong.

778
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,900
I believe you.
Did nothing wrong.

779
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,000
I didn't do
anything wrong.

780
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,900
I didn't do
anything wrong.

781
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,300
It's ok. It's ok.

782
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,700
I didn't do
anything wrong.
It's ok.

783
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,700
I got to do this.

784
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,500
You have to tell him
that i didn't do anything
with those other guys.

785
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,200
I never did.
I never did.

786
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,700
I will.
I never did.

787
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,600
Steven, i promise you,

788
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,000
I will tell him.

789
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,700
I didn't do anything.

790
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,000
Let's go. Let's go.

791
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,700
Scary.

792
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,000
Yeah.

793
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,200
I was pretty sure
he wasn't gonna
try anything.

794
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,900
Pretty sure, huh?

795
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,700
Well, let's call it
an educated guess.

796
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,300
Hey, zig, bag this
for evidence.

797
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,400
You like it here, huh?

798
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,500
South beach?

799
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,500
Come on.
What's not to like?

800
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,900
I mean, if i'm not
on duty, of course.

801
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,400
Anytime you're free,

802
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,800
I can introduce you
to the real south beach,

803
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,900
Stuff we locals like
to keep to ourselves.

804
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,700
You think you can show
me a good time, huh?

805
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,800
You look like mojitos,
cuban food, brazilian jazz.

806
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,500
That's not bad.

807
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,800
Call it
an educated guess.

808
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,600
Come on down, papi.

809
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,800
I'll take
good care of you.

810
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,400
I'll hold you to that.

811
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,000
Morgan,
you couldn't wait?

812
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,000
This one's on me, hotch.

813
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,800
I didn't think
we had enough time.

814
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,500
Detective lopez signed this
into your custody.

815
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
Oh, thank you.

816
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,400
I still
can't believe it.

817
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,700
That charlie was gay?
No.

818
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,200
That he thought
he couldn't tell me

819
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,000
That he thought
he had to hide it.

820
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
I mean, i can't think
of anything i'd have
cared less about

821
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,800
Than him being gay,
you know,

822
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,400
Well,

823
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,800
He was my friend,
and i loved him,

824
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,100
And all i ever would've
wanted was for him
to be happy, you know?

825
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,600
Rosie thomas:
* i'm wandering, i'm crawling *

826
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,200
* i'm two steps away
from falling... *

827
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,500
Take care
of yourself, jj.

828
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:57,700
Thomas: * and i'm heavy,
i'm weary... *

829
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,400
You should
go for him.
What?

830
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,700
You'd make
a cute couple.

831
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,200
You know what?

832
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,000
Hey, will...

833
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,200
It's not that i didn't
want them to know.

834
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,800
I don't care about that.
It's not about
the relocating.

835
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,600
It's not about traveling
on the weekends
or some guy.

836
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:26,400
I didn't want
to tell anyone

837
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,000
It becomes real,

838
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,300
And when
it becomes real,
people get hurt,

839
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,200
And i've always run from
getting hurt, always,
and--

840
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,800
I don't want
to run anymore,

841
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,900
Not from you, and--
Just shut up.

842
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:45,800
Thomas: * and i'm sinking,
i'm drowning *

843
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,100
* i'm so afraid of losing *

844
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:50,600
* my head's
been spinning round... *

845
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,300
Well, finally.
Mm.

846
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:53,800
I thought she was
never gonna admit it.

847
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,000
Yeah. What's it been,
like, a year?

848
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,700
Yeah, something
like that.
