1
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,425
Brian matloff, this is the fbi!

2
00:00:30,425 --> 00:00:32,612
We have a warrant for your arrest!

3
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,112
Clear!

4
00:00:42,425 --> 00:00:43,488
Clear!

5
00:00:44,237 --> 00:00:45,488
Clear!

6
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,862
He's going to the roof!

7
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,941
You got nowhere to go, man.

8
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:18,112
Matloff!

9
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,550
Hang on, man! I'm coming over there.

10
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:35,800
Morgan, don't do it!

11
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:45,862
No!

12
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,675
He's still alive.

13
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:22,800
Not for long.

14
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:25,425
Not after that.

15
00:02:25,425 --> 00:02:29,253
We need e.M.S., southside alleyway. Send them now.

16
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,422
???????

17
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:38,253
It's remarkable.

18
00:02:38,253 --> 00:02:40,550
Something like this makes you question everything you thought you knew.

19
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,425
Yeah. It's like the monolith in 2001.

20
00:02:43,425 --> 00:02:46,237
So there was actually a time when something like this was socially acceptable?

21
00:02:46,237 --> 00:02:47,875
Oh...you're young.

22
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:50,940
The eighties left a lot of people confused.

23
00:02:51,438 --> 00:02:54,925
This is, uh, especially sad, though.

24
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:57,175
All right, very funny, you guys. Very funny.

25
00:02:57,175 --> 00:02:58,847
What did you do to it?
Do?

26
00:02:58,847 --> 00:03:01,800
Well, you obviously altered it in photoshop or something. That hair?

27
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,253
Oh, no, pussycat. That's all you.

28
00:03:04,862 --> 00:03:06,441
Garfield high, class of '89.

29
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,999
You really didn't change anything?

30
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:10,331
I hacked it, as is.

31
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:13,440
You're seriously trying to tell me
you don't remember  rocking that look?

32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,675
Perhaps your lack of recognition stems
from a dissociative fugue suffered in adolescence,

33
00:03:17,675 --> 00:03:19,957
Say, at a siouxsie and the banshees concert.

34
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,613
It's so weird.

35
00:03:21,925 --> 00:03:23,800
It's like some other life.

36
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,143
What was that about? Brian matloff.

37
00:03:27,438 --> 00:03:30,613
Who? Uh, aka the blue ridge strangler.

38
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:32,999
Oh, right. That was, like, 4 years ago.

39
00:03:32,999 --> 00:03:34,999
3 victims in the blue ridge parkway.

40
00:03:35,265 --> 00:03:36,613
Allegedly. He was never convicted.

41
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:38,862
He slipped into a coma before he could be tried.

42
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:40,988
Looks like they're finally gonna get their chance.

43
00:03:41,112 --> 00:03:42,316
He just woke up.

44
00:03:42,316 --> 00:03:44,925
I don't care. If his name's on the file, pull it.

45
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:45,925
I gotta go.

46
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:49,425
How are you, cece?

47
00:03:49,425 --> 00:03:51,503
Good. Quite a turn, huh? Yeah.

48
00:03:51,503 --> 00:03:52,925
Thanks for coming down.

49
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,050
So what's your plan? Plan?

50
00:03:55,453 --> 00:03:57,987
Try him and fry him. Ms. Hillenbrand?

51
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,987
You can come back now. Ok.

52
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,863
The indictment is still alive and i want you on board to testify.

53
00:04:02,863 --> 00:04:05,675
Sure, whatever i can do. But 4 years is a long time.

54
00:04:05,675 --> 00:04:07,925
Meaning what? The indictment may be intact,

55
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:11,566
But the case won't be. People move on, retire, evidence degrades.

56
00:04:11,566 --> 00:04:12,550
Right.

57
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,487
I forgot you used to be a prosecutor.

58
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:17,613
And i got burned more than once when time dangech the fabric of a case.

59
00:04:17,613 --> 00:04:19,800
Well, time hasn't changed the facts.

60
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,660
He killed 3 people, maybe more.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,315
Who knows? Maybe rip van winkle's ready to come clean.

62
00:04:26,062 --> 00:04:29,050
If you're talking about mr. Matloff,  i'm afraid  that's not likely.

63
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,987
The patient has focal retrograde amnesia. What?

64
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,315
You're telling me he doesn't remember the murders?

65
00:04:35,315 --> 00:04:37,112
He can't even remember his name.

Brunette, young.

75
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,362
They were jogging?

76
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:44,628
Alone, early in the morning. Easy prey.

77
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:48,190
Well, that's about the worst news i could have gotten.

78
00:05:48,797 --> 00:05:53,050
Marvin leopold, our only key witness, died 2 years ago.

79
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,941
He o.D.?

80
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:56,456
How'd you know? I remember he had a heroin problem.

81
00:05:56,456 --> 00:05:57,737
Your best witness was a junkie?

82
00:05:57,737 --> 00:06:02,238
It was solid. He put matloff at the park with darci corbett, victim number 3.

83
00:06:02,238 --> 00:06:05,425
The warrant and the indictment were made largely on the witness.

84
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:06,925
Everything else is circumstantial.

85
00:06:06,925 --> 00:06:09,800
I could name a dozen killers we got convicted with less.

86
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,925
Well, you're not the one arguing a rail-Thin case in front of the 23rd circuit.

87
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,675
The rocket docket. Gives me half the time to prepare.

88
00:06:16,675 --> 00:06:17,768
I can help you prep.

89
00:06:17,768 --> 00:06:20,612
And i'll go over the case with our team. The local detective retired.

90
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:22,999
There may be lines of investigation that fell off.

91
00:06:22,999 --> 00:06:24,175
Cece: i appreciate it.

92
00:06:24,359 --> 00:06:26,050
We're not just doing it for you.

93
00:06:26,437 --> 00:06:27,999
We're doing it for them.

94
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:35,675
???????

95
00:06:35,675 --> 00:06:38,347
Detective. Wish i could say it was good to see you again.

96
00:06:39,362 --> 00:06:42,238
This is our, uh, newest agent dr. Spencer reid.

97
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:44,472
Ted jarvis. A little young, aren't you?

98
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:46,175
No offense. None taken.

99
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:49,300
In fact, neural processing speeds reach their maximum at around age 15,

100
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,425
So when it comes to being affected by crime scenes and other graphic visual input,

101
00:06:52,425 --> 00:06:54,753
We're all really the same age. Hotch: reid.

102
00:06:54,875 --> 00:06:56,300
Tell me what you see.

103
00:06:57,112 --> 00:07:00,456
Ligature marks seem to match that of the previous 2 victims.

104
00:07:00,456 --> 00:07:02,815
He uses a belt. It's his signature.

105
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,722
Tan line on the wrist means her watch is missing.

106
00:07:05,722 --> 00:07:06,769
He takes trophies.

107
00:07:06,769 --> 00:07:08,550
They're always buried facedown.

108
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,613
It's a sign of remorse.

109
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:11,253
He can't bear looking them in the face.

110
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:12,784
So he knows them personally?

111
00:07:12,784 --> 00:07:14,999
You don't have to know somebody to regret killing them.

112
00:07:14,999 --> 00:07:16,737
No, he picks these women because he can.

113
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:17,738
He's opportunistic.

114
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:20,331
These victims happened to be in the wrong place at the right time.

115
00:07:20,331 --> 00:07:22,175
Bogey coming in.

116
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:24,441
The father?

117
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,175
Don't suppose you guys want to rochambeau for the privilege?

118
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:30,441
I'll go.

119
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:33,500
Go get 'em, tiger.

120
00:07:39,813 --> 00:07:41,378
It's her, isn't it?

121
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:43,438
It's my darci.

122
00:07:43,488 --> 00:07:45,863
It might be, sir, but if it is,

123
00:07:45,863 --> 00:07:47,675
You don't want to see her.

124
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,999
This isn't a memory that you want.

125
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,519
After the raid on matloff's apartment,

126
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:02,925
We discovered he had another area of interest.

127
00:08:02,925 --> 00:08:05,612
Native american mythology.

128
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:07,863
We realized our profile wasn't complete.

129
00:08:07,863 --> 00:08:09,518
There's a native american believe that says

130
00:08:09,518 --> 00:08:13,456
Burying a body facedown traps the soul and prevents it from haunting the killer.

131
00:08:13,456 --> 00:08:14,488
That's why he buried them like this?

132
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:15,640
That was the theory.

133
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,175
3 women in shallow graves.

134
00:08:17,175 --> 00:08:19,062
I don't see any progression.

135
00:08:19,112 --> 00:08:20,566
There's no learning curve.

136
00:08:20,566 --> 00:08:21,831
Do you think there could have been more,

137
00:08:21,831 --> 00:08:23,600
Earlier victims when he was honing his skills?

138
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,866
We considered it
a possibility.

139
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,487
It turned out matloff
worked in blue ridge parkway

140
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:28,334
For the forest service.

141
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,267
He had free reign
over the entire park.

142
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:32,533
It says here he was
raised polish catholic.

143
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:36,112
Any idea what led him to identify
with native american culture?

144
00:08:36,112 --> 00:08:37,112
We didn't get that far.

145
00:08:37,112 --> 00:08:39,331
Another thing we never got
was any physical evidee

146
00:08:39,331 --> 00:08:41,237
At his apartment
tying him to the crimes.

147
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:43,222
What about the jewelry he took,
the souvenirs?

148
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,550
No trace.

149
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,882
So what did he do with him?

150
00:08:45,949 --> 00:08:48,862
Well, if we didn't need the
answer to that before, we do now.

151
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:51,737
It turns out our star witness
has been dead for 2 years.

152
00:08:53,188 --> 00:08:55,987
He was the only one who could
put matloff at the scene.

153
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:00,050
There might be another way.

154
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:03,715
We'd like to request
that the defendant

155
00:09:03,782 --> 00:09:06,449
Undergo the process
of brain fingerprinting.

156
00:09:06,516 --> 00:09:08,238
This procedure will show

157
00:09:08,238 --> 00:09:09,383
If the memories
of the crimes

158
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:12,050
Are present in the mind
of the defendant,

159
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:14,769
Regardless of whether or not
he chooses to recall them.

160
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,487
Your honor,
where do i begin?

161
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:18,050
The science
on this type of testing

162
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,222
Is unproven,
to say the least.

163
00:09:19,222 --> 00:09:21,722
<i>In the state of iowa
vs. Terry harrington,</i>

164
00:09:21,722 --> 00:09:24,675
The results were ruled
admissible as scientific evidence

165
00:09:24,675 --> 00:09:26,862
As defined in
congress ruling 702

166
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:28,016
<i>And in daubert v. Merrell.</i>

167
00:09:28,082 --> 00:09:29,675
This is a hail mary,
your honor.

168
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:31,383
They have no evidence
and they know it.

169
00:09:31,449 --> 00:09:33,049
And beyond that,
my client

170
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:35,129
Is in a very fragile
mental state.

171
00:09:35,129 --> 00:09:38,283
I can't in good conscience let
them go poking around in his brain.

172
00:09:38,349 --> 00:09:40,987
What about that?
Is it safe?

173
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:45,441
The test is non-Invasive
and completely safe.

174
00:09:45,441 --> 00:09:47,708
They'll simply be looking at
images on a computer screen

175
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,175
While an eeg monitors
his brain activity.

176
00:09:50,175 --> 00:09:53,566
Subject him to graphic imagery
to prompt some kind of reaction,

177
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:55,866
Which they can then point to
as evidence of guilt?

178
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,666
It's perverse.
I object to even-

179
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:59,699
I want to do it.

180
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:05,632
Just one moment, your honor.

181
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:09,332
Your honor...

182
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:13,165
Every day i waken to this, uh...

183
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:15,098
Nightmare

184
00:10:15,165 --> 00:10:17,465
Of not knowing who or...

185
00:10:17,532 --> 00:10:19,299
What i am,

186
00:10:19,365 --> 00:10:23,966
And if this test
can really help me remember,

187
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,033
Then whatever the consequences,

188
00:10:26,098 --> 00:10:28,033
I- I want to do it.

189
00:10:28,098 --> 00:10:29,933
I have to.

190
00:10:34,098 --> 00:10:36,365
Dr. Reid.

191
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:38,363
Mr. Corbett.

192
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:40,033
I didn't see you in there.
How have you been?

193
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,632
Oh... not bad,

194
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:43,432
Considering. Um...

195
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:45,866
You aren't not buying this
amnesia thing, are you?

196
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,160
I'm trying to figure that out.

197
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,966
It's probably something
the lawyer thought up.

198
00:10:51,033 --> 00:10:52,175
It won't work, will it?

199
00:10:52,175 --> 00:10:53,737
We have a pretty strong case.

200
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,799
Good. That's good.

201
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:57,332
You look different.

202
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,999
Your hair.

203
00:10:59,065 --> 00:11:00,666
It's been 4 years.

204
00:11:00,732 --> 00:11:02,699
Right. I forget.

205
00:11:02,766 --> 00:11:06,666
Sometimes i feel like
darci's just...

206
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:09,499
Ah-It messes with time,
this thing.

207
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:11,432
You know? You lose time.

208
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:13,599
Yeah. I know.

209
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,753
You always hear about
closure, you know?

210
00:11:16,753 --> 00:11:18,832
Andyou never really
knowwhat that means.

211
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,265
Maybe now i can...

212
00:11:21,332 --> 00:11:22,866
Get on with things,
you know?

213
00:11:23,175 --> 00:11:25,332
How's mrs. Corbett doing?

214
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,432
Is, uh, she here?

215
00:11:26,499 --> 00:11:28,332
Oh, no, no, no.
She's, uh...

216
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:29,599
We split up.

217
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,065
It...

218
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:35,033
Was hard to...

219
00:11:35,098 --> 00:11:36,966
It was my fault, really.

220
00:11:37,033 --> 00:11:38,999
I'm sure it was just,
you know...

221
00:11:39,862 --> 00:11:41,033
It happens.

222
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:43,866
Yeah. It's ok.

223
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,632
Everything's
gonna be ok now.

224
00:11:52,966 --> 00:11:55,899
You're with the fbi, right?

225
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,499
You don't remember me?

226
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,799
We met during
the investigation.

227
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,332
So... you don't have
any doubts, then,

228
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,933
About me,

229
00:12:07,999 --> 00:12:09,332
Who and what i am?

230
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,866
No, i don't.

231
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,165
We're ready here.

232
00:13:06,966 --> 00:13:09,198
Yeah, jj.
I'm in with matloff.

233
00:13:09,265 --> 00:13:11,432
I'm at the hospital. I may
have something interesting.

234
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:12,347
What have you got?

235
00:13:12,347 --> 00:13:15,465
Matloff had a visitor that
came about once every 6 months

236
00:13:15,532 --> 00:13:16,499
While he was here.

237
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:17,666
Somebody we know?

238
00:13:17,732 --> 00:13:20,232
It's not a name i recognize
from the case file.

239
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,566
The name on the visitor log
is nina moore.

240
00:13:22,632 --> 00:13:24,232
Track her down.
I gotta go.

241
00:13:24,299 --> 00:13:25,362
I'm on it.

242
00:13:25,362 --> 00:13:27,666
He tested no mermers
across the board,

243
00:13:27,732 --> 00:13:28,899
On each variable image.

244
00:13:28,966 --> 00:13:29,799
Mermers?

245
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:31,332
It's an acronym.

246
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:33,613
Memory and encoding related
multi-Faceted-

247
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:34,499
Is it good or bad?

248
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:35,706
Depends on how you look at it.

249
00:13:35,706 --> 00:13:38,432
It means he showed no
familiarity with the images.

250
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,499
Either he really
doesn't remember-

251
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:42,300
Or we got the wrong guy.

252
00:13:47,859 --> 00:13:49,363
The brain fingerprinting

253
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:52,050
May have just killed any chance
we have of putting matloff away.

254
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:53,999
The d.A. Isn't required
to enter it into evidence.

255
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,425
No, but he can get it
on discovery

256
00:13:55,425 --> 00:13:56,675
And you can bet
he's gonna use it.

257
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:58,576
And that's why i distrust
all technology.

258
00:13:58,642 --> 00:14:00,254
So how'd he get over?

259
00:14:00,254 --> 00:14:01,742
I thought nobody
could beat this test.

260
00:14:01,809 --> 00:14:03,343
The damage
to his parietal lobe

261
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,316
Must have been more extensive
than previously thought.

262
00:14:05,316 --> 00:14:06,176
The brain injury
could have literally

263
00:14:06,243 --> 00:14:07,276
Deleted his memories.

264
00:14:07,343 --> 00:14:08,775
Oh, he did the murders,
and we'll prove it.

265
00:14:08,842 --> 00:14:09,909
What he remembers
doesn't matter.

266
00:14:09,976 --> 00:14:12,009
Doesn't it?
I mean, if those experiences

267
00:14:12,076 --> 00:14:15,143
Are gone forever, doesn't that sort
of make him, i don't know, like...

268
00:14:15,209 --> 00:14:16,343
Yeah.
Different person?

269
00:14:16,409 --> 00:14:17,300
No, not at all.

270
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,576
Not to me.
It's interesting-

271
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:20,175
It goes to core arguments

272
00:14:20,175 --> 00:14:21,487
About the nature
of identity.

273
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:22,709
There's a western
philosophical concept,

274
00:14:22,775 --> 00:14:25,816
Causal dependence, that says that
a psyological connection to the past

275
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:27,109
Plays a key role
in defining who we are.

276
00:14:27,176 --> 00:14:28,976
Reid, what are you saying, that
this guy shouldn't be tried?

277
00:14:29,042 --> 00:14:30,050
I'm not saying that.

278
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,343
Prentiss: but one could
make the argument

279
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:32,642
That in his current condition

280
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,675
He's no longer
a danger to society.

281
00:14:34,742 --> 00:14:35,942
Not until he gets
his memory back.

282
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,128
But it's not just about
this guy being a danger.

283
00:14:38,128 --> 00:14:39,376
It's about making sure
somebody pays

284
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,675
For what happened
to those girls.

285
00:14:40,675 --> 00:14:43,191
Well, it's not up to us to decide
to what extent he should be punished.

286
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:45,159
That's for the courts. Where are
we with matloff's mystery visitor?

287
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:48,176
Prentiss and i contacted
every recorded nina moore

288
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:49,976
Within 500 miles
of the hospital.

289
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:51,942
71 in total, no takers.

290
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:54,847
Matloff's a textbook loner.
No meaningful relationships,

291
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:55,976
No family, no girlfriends.

292
00:14:56,042 --> 00:14:57,809
But anyone who would visit
a coma patient-

293
00:14:57,876 --> 00:14:59,209
A triple murderer
coma patient.

294
00:14:59,276 --> 00:15:01,809
We're talking about somebody
who feels connected to him.

295
00:15:01,876 --> 00:15:03,742
Maybe connected enough
to know the truth.

296
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:05,309
The truth could be
she's just a fan.

297
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:06,987
Every serial killer's
got 'em.

298
00:15:06,987 --> 00:15:08,842
Let's go back to the hospital
and interview the staff.

299
00:15:08,909 --> 00:15:10,999
We need to build a profile
and help locate this woman.

300
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:30,343
You all right in there?

301
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:32,543
You were screaming.

302
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,543
It was just a dream.

303
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,376
I guess i'm...

304
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:41,143
Anxious with the trial...

305
00:15:41,209 --> 00:15:42,876
Starting tomorrow.

306
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,543
You passed that brain test
thing, right?

307
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:48,775
That's good.

308
00:15:50,175 --> 00:15:51,675
Suppose i could get...

309
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,309
Something to...

310
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:56,243
Write with
and a piece of paper?

311
00:15:56,309 --> 00:15:58,109
Doctor said
it'd be good for...

312
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:00,076
I'll see what i can do.

313
00:16:00,143 --> 00:16:02,709
Hey, what's that smell?

314
00:16:03,543 --> 00:16:05,443
Um...

315
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,409
It's popcorn.

316
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:09,243
Popcorn?

317
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:11,109
Bill made some
on his break.

318
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:14,942
Do i like popcorn?

319
00:16:20,343 --> 00:16:21,842
Ladies and gentlemen,

320
00:16:21,909 --> 00:16:24,175
You are here
to bring justice

321
00:16:24,175 --> 00:16:26,876
To the families
of 3 beautiful young women

322
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,675
Whose lives were cut short

323
00:16:28,742 --> 00:16:31,042
By a cold
and calculating killer.

324
00:16:31,109 --> 00:16:33,009
Darci corbett,

325
00:16:33,076 --> 00:16:34,876
Celeste ferami,

326
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:36,675
April sotherford.

327
00:16:36,742 --> 00:16:39,999
3 women out for a run
or a jog in the park

328
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,343
When they were approached by an
employee of the forestry service.

329
00:16:43,409 --> 00:16:45,976
An employee
who used his authority

330
00:16:46,042 --> 00:16:48,642
To lure these women
into a secluded area

331
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:51,309
Where he could safely
perform the act of murder.

332
00:16:51,376 --> 00:16:53,143
Was it the work
of a serial killer?

333
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:54,642
Perhaps.

334
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:56,809
But the theory
that my client

335
00:16:56,876 --> 00:16:58,909
Is the responsible party
is just that-

336
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,309
A theory.

337
00:17:00,376 --> 00:17:02,309
He strangled them slowly,

338
00:17:02,376 --> 00:17:04,809
Inflicting maximum
suffering and terror,

339
00:17:04,876 --> 00:17:07,976
And in the process,
turned the blue ride parkway

340
00:17:08,042 --> 00:17:09,642
Into his own private
killing fields.

341
00:17:09,709 --> 00:17:12,709
No eyewitness,
no fingerprints, no dna,

342
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:14,409
No murder weapon.

343
00:17:14,476 --> 00:17:16,675
Not one shred of hard evidence.

344
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:18,842
The only way that
they can tie my client

345
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:20,343
To these crimes

346
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,842
Is through the pseudo-Science
called profiling.

347
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,343
At the close
of evidence,

348
00:17:24,409 --> 00:17:25,675
You will know

349
00:17:25,742 --> 00:17:28,176
That brian matloff

350
00:17:28,243 --> 00:17:30,675
Is the man who
committed these crimes,

351
00:17:30,742 --> 00:17:33,675
Whher he remembers it
or not.

352
00:17:34,238 --> 00:17:37,343
So, through this process
of lkage analysis,

353
00:17:37,409 --> 00:17:39,206
You concluded
that all 3 murders

354
00:17:39,206 --> 00:17:40,800
Were perpetrated
by one man.

355
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,409
Yes, that's correct.

356
00:17:42,476 --> 00:17:44,842
And you believe that man
is brian matloff?

357
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:46,276
Yes, i do.

358
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:48,925
Can you tell us how you
came to that conclusion?

359
00:17:48,925 --> 00:17:50,643
Along with agents
reid and morgan,

360
00:17:50,643 --> 00:17:52,576
We began to analyze
the behavior

361
00:17:52,642 --> 00:17:54,143
Of the unknown subject

362
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,143
As manifested before,
during, and after

363
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:57,876
The commission
of the murders.

364
00:17:57,942 --> 00:17:59,876
Our goal was to generate
a suspect pool,

365
00:17:59,942 --> 00:18:03,276
A list of names which we'd
eventually narrow down to one person.

366
00:18:03,362 --> 00:18:06,276
He hunts 200,000 acres
like it's his own backyard.

367
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:09,476
He attacks high-Risk victims,
young, strong female joggers,

368
00:18:09,543 --> 00:18:10,909
But in low-Risk locations.

369
00:18:10,976 --> 00:18:13,510
Like david carpenter,
the trailside killer.

370
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:14,476
Are there other parallels?

371
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:15,942
This guy's different.

372
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:17,610
Carpenter used
a blitz attack.

373
00:18:17,675 --> 00:18:19,809
This unsub insinuates himself,
disarms the victims.

374
00:18:19,876 --> 00:18:21,809
Maybe he uses a con,

375
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:23,610
Playing the injured
hiker, lost dog?

376
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:24,842
Too many variables.

377
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:28,176
She could run for help
or call 911 on her cell phone

378
00:18:28,243 --> 00:18:29,809
Before he gains control.

379
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:31,942
Control.

380
00:18:32,009 --> 00:18:33,909
He's in a position
of authority.

381
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:35,503
But not law enforcement.

382
00:18:35,503 --> 00:18:37,576
A cop would know better than to
bury a body in 2 feet of dirt.

383
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:39,942
The forest service would give
him access to service roads.

384
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:41,510
This deduction revealed to us

385
00:18:41,576 --> 00:18:43,842
How the killer gained
satisfaction from his crimes.

386
00:18:43,909 --> 00:18:45,343
By burying the victims
in the park,

387
00:18:45,409 --> 00:18:47,510
He was able to revisit
the scene

388
00:18:47,576 --> 00:18:49,276
And relive his acts
over and over.

389
00:18:49,343 --> 00:18:51,809
So, i imagine there are
a lot of people

390
00:18:51,876 --> 00:18:53,443
Who work for
the forest service.

391
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:56,443
1,718 employees.

392
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,009
He won't be a new employee.

393
00:18:58,076 --> 00:18:59,543
He's cautious, he's organized.

394
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,376
He leaves behind
no trace evidence.

395
00:19:01,443 --> 00:19:02,510
He's bordering on paranoid.

396
00:19:02,576 --> 00:19:03,876
He's the kind of guy
who needs to know

397
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,076
Exactly what the cops know.

398
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,476
He's probably inserted
himself

399
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:09,009
Into the investigation
already.

400
00:19:09,076 --> 00:19:11,976
Hey, what's that new
tech girl's name?

401
00:19:12,042 --> 00:19:13,309
Uh...

402
00:19:13,376 --> 00:19:15,143
Gomez, i think.

403
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,842
Excuse me, gomez.

404
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:20,842
Hey, baby girl.

405
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:25,909
Baby girl?

406
00:19:25,976 --> 00:19:27,775
Forgive me. I just
didn't know the real-

407
00:19:27,842 --> 00:19:29,675
I've been called worse.

408
00:19:29,742 --> 00:19:31,315
What can i do for you?

409
00:19:31,315 --> 00:19:35,176
And what did technical
analyst garcia do at that time?

410
00:19:35,243 --> 00:19:38,409
We asked her to check names
of forestry employees

411
00:19:38,476 --> 00:19:39,842
Against a list of witnesses

412
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,737
Interviewed
by the roanoke police.

413
00:19:41,737 --> 00:19:43,976
And were you able to find
a common denominator?

414
00:19:44,042 --> 00:19:45,143
Yes, one.

415
00:19:45,209 --> 00:19:46,706
Brian matloff.

416
00:19:46,706 --> 00:19:48,642
Of course it went well.
I taught him everything he knows

417
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,109
About giving testimony.

418
00:19:50,176 --> 00:19:52,343
How'd the jury react?

419
00:19:52,409 --> 00:19:54,343
Good.

420
00:19:54,409 --> 00:19:56,009
Ok. Give me a call

421
00:19:56,076 --> 00:19:58,050
After the defense
has had a go at him.

422
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:00,842
Reid says thing are good
at the trial.

423
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,737
How did it go
at the hospital?

424
00:20:02,737 --> 00:20:03,707
Our interviews filled in
some blanks

425
00:20:03,707 --> 00:20:05,628
About the woman
who vited matloff.

426
00:20:05,628 --> 00:20:07,610
Uh, late 40s to mid-50s,

427
00:20:07,675 --> 00:20:09,510
With quiet,
almost nervous demeanor.

428
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:12,076
On her first visit, she didn't
even make it into the room.

429
00:20:12,143 --> 00:20:14,510
She just stood in the doorway and
watched for a few minutes and then left.

430
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:15,510
And on later visits,

431
00:20:15,576 --> 00:20:17,443
She'd what, sit with him,
talk to him?

432
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,610
Read to him.

433
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,510
On more than one occasion,

434
00:20:20,576 --> 00:20:22,376
She asked the nurses
about his condition,

435
00:20:22,443 --> 00:20:24,942
And they said she appeared
"concerned with his pain."

436
00:20:25,009 --> 00:20:26,809
That sounds almost maternal.

437
00:20:26,876 --> 00:20:28,742
We thought so, too,

438
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:31,675
But his parents effectively
disowned him after the indictment.

439
00:20:31,675 --> 00:20:34,376
So we called his mother
to make sure,

440
00:20:34,443 --> 00:20:35,809
Got to talking,
and guess what.

441
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:36,942
She's not his mother.

442
00:20:37,009 --> 00:20:38,410
And his father's
not his father.

443
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,243
Matloff was adopted?

444
00:20:40,309 --> 00:20:42,642
This visitor could be
his birth mother.

445
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,276
She's the right age.

446
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,176
They may have had a relationship
that no one knew about.

447
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:48,610
What other physical
description did you get?

448
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:50,842
Uh, brunette, brown eyes,
dark complexion.

449
00:20:50,909 --> 00:20:55,343
One nurse thought hispanic,
another one said mediterranean.

450
00:20:55,409 --> 00:20:57,476
What about native american?

451
00:20:57,543 --> 00:21:00,042
That would explain his
interest in the culture.

452
00:21:00,109 --> 00:21:03,209
He's trying to get in touch
with his roots.

453
00:21:03,276 --> 00:21:06,343
Now, my client
ran from the police,

454
00:21:06,409 --> 00:21:07,876
A behavior
that you called

455
00:21:07,942 --> 00:21:10,487
A strong indicator
of his guilt.

456
00:21:10,487 --> 00:21:11,376
Yes, that's correct.

457
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:12,976
Were you aware that

458
00:21:13,042 --> 00:21:14,642
He had
an outstanding warrant

459
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,343
At the time of his arrest?

460
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:19,343
Yes. I believe it was for an
automobile accident, a hit and run.

461
00:21:19,409 --> 00:21:23,237
So isn't it possible
that mr. Matloff fled

462
00:21:23,237 --> 00:21:24,909
Not because
he was guilty of murder,

463
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:26,642
But because of
this other warrant?

464
00:21:26,709 --> 00:21:30,143
There were 8 law enforcement
officers in bulletproof vests.

465
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:31,576
I doubt any reasonable
person would assume-

466
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:33,675
A yes or no answer
will do.

467
00:21:33,742 --> 00:21:35,042
Yes, it's possible.

468
00:21:36,576 --> 00:21:39,050
Right. 54, native american.

469
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:44,015
Ma'am, i have all that. What i really
need now is identifiable information.

470
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,582
Yes, i know what
a closed adoption means.

471
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:48,409
Do you know
what a court order means?

472
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:50,942
We don't
have time for court orders.

473
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,510
You know what, ma'am?
I am done being nice.

474
00:21:53,576 --> 00:21:55,942
If you look to your cursor, you'll
notice it's moving on its own.

475
00:21:56,009 --> 00:21:58,510
That's me hacking
your secure network.

476
00:21:58,576 --> 00:22:01,809
Now i got her file,
now i got her social,

477
00:22:01,876 --> 00:22:03,443
And now,
'cause you're grumpy,

478
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:06,243
I'm gonna send your boss
these jamaican vacation photos.

479
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:09,576
Check you out-
No tan lines.

480
00:22:09,642 --> 00:22:12,675
Nina genesee,
married in 1978,

481
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:13,842
Changed her name to moore,

482
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:15,443
Current address
madison heights, virginia.

483
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,610
Madison heights.

484
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:19,476
No, i called this woman.
She said she wasn't the one.

485
00:22:19,543 --> 00:22:21,443
Said she'd never even
been to roanoke.

486
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,581
Why would she lie?

487
00:22:22,581 --> 00:22:26,076
And why hasn't she tried
to see him since he woke up?

488
00:22:26,143 --> 00:22:29,576
So, you've stated that it
was your profile of the killer

489
00:22:29,642 --> 00:22:31,503
That led you and the police

490
00:22:31,503 --> 00:22:32,899
To my client's door
that night.

491
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:36,200
Behavioral analysis was a
factor in our investigation, yes.

492
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,700
And was behavioral
analysis also a factor

493
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,400
In the olympic park
bombings case in atlanta?

494
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,100
Yes, it was.

495
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:45,300
And was that suspect
you identified, richard jewell,

496
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,800
Ever convicted
of the bombings?

497
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,600
Objection.
Relevance.

498
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,100
Goes to the credibility
of the witness and his field.

499
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,200
I'll allow it.

500
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
No, he was not
convicted.

501
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,400
Because he was innocent.

502
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,600
Your profile led you
to the wrong man.

503
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,200
Jewell was not the perpetrator,
but if you look at the real

504
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,900
Olympic park bomber,
eric rudolph,

505
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,900
You'll see that our profile
was dead on.

506
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,200
Well, how about if we look
at the baton rouge killer?

507
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,700
Your unit said
that hwas white

508
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
And living in the city.

509
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,700
He was black
and from the suburbs.

510
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,300
You said that dennis rader,
the btk killer,

511
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,300
Was divorced and impotent.

512
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,300
He turned out to be
married with 2 kids.

513
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,800
Objection, your honor.

514
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,200
He's giving a sermon.

515
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,500
Do you have a question
in there somewhere, counselor?

516
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,400
Having been wrong
on those cases,

517
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,000
Isn't it possible that you
were wrong about brian matloff?

518
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,800
No.

519
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,100
The fact is,
behavioral analysis

520
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,400
Is really just
intellectual guesswork.

521
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,200
You probably couldn't tell
me the color of my socks

522
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,900
With any greater accuracy
than a carnival psychic.

523
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,900
Objection.

524
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
Withdrawn.

525
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,200
Charcoal gray.

526
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,800
Well, look at that.

527
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,700
He got one right.

528
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,000
You match them
to the color of your suit

529
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,500
To appear taller.
You also wear lifts

530
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
And you've had the soles
of your shoes replaced.

531
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,100
One might think
you're frugal, but in fact,

532
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,100
You're having
financial difficulties.

533
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,300
You wear a fake rolex

534
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,900
Because you pawned your real one
to pay your debts.

535
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,600
My guess is to a bookie.

536
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,800
I took this case pro bono.

537
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,800
I am one of the most
successful criminal attorneys

538
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
In the state.

539
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,300
Your vice is horses.

540
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,000
Your blackberry's been buzzing
on the table every 20 minutes,

541
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,500
Which happens to be the average time
between posts from colonial downs.

542
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,000
You're getting race results.

543
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,800
And every time you do,
it affects your mood in court,

544
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
And you're not having
a very good day.

545
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
That's because you pick horses
the same way you practice law-

546
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,200
By always taking the long shot.

547
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,900
Well, you spin
a very good yarn, agent,

548
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,400
But as usual,
you've proven nothing.

549
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,200
If i'm not mistaken,
the results from the fifth race

550
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,000
Should be coming through
any minute.

551
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,400
Why don't you tell us
if your luck has changed?

552
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,100
Your honor, this is-

553
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,300
What do you want me to do?

554
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,800
Either show us your blackberry
or cut him loose, counselor.

555
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,600
Nothing further.

556
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,300
Wise decision.
Court will be adjourned

557
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,000
Until 9 a.M. Tomorrow.

558
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,800
Mr. Corbett.

559
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,400
Hey, uh, i just wanted
to make sure you knew

560
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,800
That cross-Examination
wasn't as bad as it sounded.

561
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,500
I'm not worried.

562
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,300
Oh.

563
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,400
Good.

564
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,900
I have a better
understanding of things now.

565
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,200
Understanding?

566
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,000
After darci died, i started
to see a therapist.

567
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,100
Had a lot of guilt,
you know.

568
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,200
Thought that i should
have been there for her,

569
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,000
Saved her somehow,
i don't know.

570
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,200
This guy, this shrink,

571
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,700
He always brought it back
to control.

572
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,000
He said i had to
accept the fact

573
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
That there were always
gonna be things in life

574
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,900
I couldn't control.

575
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,600
I think that's wise.

576
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,000
I realize i have no say over
what goes on in that courtroom.

577
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,700
See you later, spencer.

578
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,500
Nina moore?

579
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Yes.

580
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,800
We're with the fbi.

581
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
Come in.

582
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
Why didn't you
come forward?

583
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I was protecting
my family.

584
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,300
They don't know?

585
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,200
I was a kid myself.

586
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,300
You give away a child...

587
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,500
I know it sounds cold,

588
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,700
But you just want
to forget about it,

589
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,200
Believe it never happened.

590
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,500
So that's how i lived.

591
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,100
But you maintained
a relationship with brian.

592
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,200
Maintained? No.

593
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,600
I only saw him once
before the accident.

594
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,200
You never got the sense
that maybe he was...

595
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,100
A murderer?
Not in the slightest.

596
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,600
I think was probably-

597
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,500
Well-I mean, from what
i understand in the news,

598
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,900
We met before it started.

599
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,600
And when was that meeting?

600
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,800
5 years ago.

601
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,500
He just called me
out of the blue.

602
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,100
The records were
supposed to be sealed.

603
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,900
I think he hired someone
to find me.

604
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,400
And what did you
talk about?

605
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:46,500
He was interested
in my family,

606
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
My kids.

607
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,600
He just wanted to...

608
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,800
Call every once
in a while,

609
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,300
Maybe meet
around the holidays.

610
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,700
But i couldn't.

611
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,700
I could barely bring myself
to look at him.

612
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,800
I just...

613
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,500
You rejected him.

614
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,700
Whatever he became,
i can't help but feel it...

615
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,600
It's my fault.

616
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,900
You can't blame yourself
for what he did.

617
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,200
Why did you visit him
at the hospital?

618
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,100
Because it was safe,
i suppose.

619
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,700
I could be there for him
and no one had to know.

620
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,900
And because when i would
read to him

621
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,800
And listen to his breathing...

622
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,100
It felt right.

623
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,200
Hey, whose car
is that out there?

624
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,900
The-Oh. Hello.

625
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,800
Who's this?

626
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,000
Excuse me.

627
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,400
That's a lot to explain.

628
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,000
She rejected him.

629
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,800
That was the stressor.

630
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:56,100
She's just lucky
he took no for an answer.

631
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,400
It could have been a lot
worse if he pressed the issue.

632
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,900
Maybe he did.

633
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,900
Mrs. Moore.

634
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,000
Did he ever send you
anything? Any gifts?

635
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I wanted
to throw them away, but...

636
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
I couldn't.

637
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,100
Please. Please.

638
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,900
Oh.

639
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,100
You ok?

640
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,100
Yeah. It's just, uh...

641
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,500
I didn't sleep last night.

642
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,500
I'm not supposed to do this,
but, um...

643
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,600
I brought something.

644
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
You want to know
if you like popcorn, right?

645
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,400
So, uh...

646
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You remember?

647
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,100
I think i'm starting to.

648
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,900
???

649
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,100
Think about what this would do

650
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,300
Think about ???

651
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,500
I am thinking about her.

652
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:04,000
If she knew
what you were about to do,

653
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,100
And depending on your belief
system, maybe she does,

654
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,400
Do you think
she'd want this?

655
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,500
Give me the gun.

656
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,200
You want him to suffer,
but he'll be dead.

657
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,900
He won't feel anything,
you'll be in prison,

658
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,700
And you will regret it,
believe me.

659
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,100
I'm already in prison.

660
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
How did you know?

661
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,000
Your affect, your behavior.

662
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,000
You were too calm yesterday, and
you called me by my first name.

663
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,400
If you're so good
at predicting things,

664
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,900
How come you couldn't stop
him before he took my darci?

665
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,200
Look, i shouldn't
say anything, but...

666
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,000
There's some new evidence.

667
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,700
What evidence?

668
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,800
My name is nina moore.

669
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,600
And what is your
relationship to the defendant?

670
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,300
I'm his birth mother.

671
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,000
His biological mother.

672
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,300
I gave him up for adoption
when he was a baby.

673
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,100
And that was how long ago?

674
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,700
37 years.

675
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,100
So you didn't have
a relationship with him?

676
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,900
No. I never saw him
until 2003.

677
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,300
He tracked you down?

678
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,400
Yes.

679
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,500
We met at a cafe

680
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,000
And talked for a bit,
and then he left.

681
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,400
And what did you
talk about?

682
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:17,800
He said he wanted
to be a part of my life.

683
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,500
I told him it was impossible.

684
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,300
You felt that
he was being...

685
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,700
Unrealistic,

686
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,900
Irrational even?

687
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,300
No, not at all.

688
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,800
He was just a little lost.

689
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:31,100
He wanted to belong
to something.

690
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,500
Turning him away
was one of the hardest things

691
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,100
I've ever had to do.

692
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,100
A person can't live
two lives.

693
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:42,300
I'm sorry, brian.
I'm so sorry.

694
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,900
Mrs. Moore,
did the defendant

695
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,900
Make any subsequent attempts
to communicate with you?

696
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,300
A few months after that,

697
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,300
I got something in the mail.

698
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,800
There was no note or anything,

699
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:56,000
Just a postmark from roanoke,

700
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,700
And i knew
that's where he lived.

701
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,900
And what were the contents
of the envelope?

702
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,600
It was a necklace.

703
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,300
2 months after that
i got another.

704
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,100
And then a watch.

705
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,400
I thought he was trying to...

706
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,500
I- I don't know,

707
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,200
Just persuade me with gifts.

708
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,100
I thought they were
estate jewelry.

709
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,600
Your honor, i'd like
to enter into evidence

710
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,300
People's exhibit "f"
through "h."

711
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,500
Are these the items that
you received in the mail?

712
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,600
Yes.

713
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,100
And the watch
in this bag-

714
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,700
Do you see it
in this photograph?

715
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,500
Yes, that's it.

716
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:36,200
Let the record reflect
the witness has identified

717
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,800
The watch
worn in this photograph

718
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,000
By murder victim
darci corbett.

719
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,200
I have nothing further.

720
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,400
Court is adjourned
until 9 a.M. Tomorrow,

721
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
Back for cross.

722
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,900
Rough day
in there, huh?

723
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,000
Cece, i need
to talk to you.

724
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,400
Hey. Listen, i don't want
to jinx this,

725
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,700
But something tells me i'm going to
be buying your team a round of drinks

726
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,700
When this is over.

727
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,500
I think he's getting
his memory back.

728
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,900
I'll get you undone
so you can change.

729
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,100
You ok?

730
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
A lot on my mind.

731
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,200
He was crying in there, when
his mother was on the stand.

732
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,600
And you don't have that kind of
reaction unless you're connected.

733
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,900
You been watching
the trial?

734
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,700
Most of it, yeah.

735
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,300
Today when my mother talked
about having to choose one life...

736
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,000
Do you believe that's true?

737
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,100
Don't you think
you'd have to choose?

738
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,000
Maybe you're right, but...

739
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,700
The fact is it doesn't
really matter anymore.

740
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,200
Doesn't it? I mean, don't you want
to know who you're putting away?

741
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,900
Heading over there now.

742
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,600
Stand back, people.

743
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:30,600
What's going on?

744
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,300
Excuse me.

745
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,300
Are you ok?

746
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,600
What happened?

747
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,600
He has my gun.

748
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,200
She's a law clerk.

749
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,600
Matloff stuck a gun
in her face,

750
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,800
Pulled her out of her car,
late model nissan.

751
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,900
And you put out an apb?

752
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,900
Statewide. We'll block
every road out of town.

753
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,900
Don't forget service roads.
He knows them all.

754
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,900
You know this guy, right?

755
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,500
Any idea
where he might be headed?

756
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,800
All depends on who he is.

757
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,000
Hey. Hey!

758
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:02,800
Did you know?

759
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,400
- Know what?
- You talked to matloff every day.

760
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,100
Did you know that his
memory was coming back?

761
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,600
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

762
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,700
He can't help us. Matloff
is a paranoid personality.

763
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,600
Even if he was aware
he wouldn't have told anyone.

764
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:15,000
Get over to the jail
and into his cell.

765
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,900
Just look for anything, any clue
that might tell us where he's headed.

766
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,100
Assuming his memory is coming
back, where's he headed?

767
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,700
Simple answer's
his birth mother.

768
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,300
His victims were brunettes.

769
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,700
Typology suggests that
he was projecting rage at her.

770
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,800
That's not an option.
She's with us, protected.

771
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,600
If he doesn't have
a specific target,

772
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,200
He'll either run
or go on a spree.

773
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
Did we do this?

774
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,900
The brain test? Reintroducing
all those memories?

775
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,400
Is it possible
that it could have acted

776
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,500
As a cognitive
rehabilitation?

777
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,100
This guy is who he is.

778
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,700
That's got nothing
to do with us.

779
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,900
Hotch, i think i know
where he's going.

780
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,000
Any sign of him?

781
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,000
He's got about a half-Hour
head start on us.

782
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,100
There's a waterfall
near the site

783
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,800
Where we found
darci corbett's body.

784
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,900
Yeah, that's linville falls.

785
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,000
That's where we need to go.

786
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,800
Figured this guy would have
headed straight out of town.

787
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,900
Why'd he come back here?

788
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
He's looking for something.

789
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:26,700
For what?

790
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,400
Himself.

791
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,500
That's him. Glasses.

792
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,200
It's him.

793
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,400
He's got a girl with him
and she's not moving.

794
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,900
All right, let's move in.

795
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,200
No, wait.
If we rush him,

796
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,600
He might try to kill her and himself.

797
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:56,800
How do you want to do this?

798
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,400
I want to go in there
myself.

799
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,900
Get your shooters
high and wide.

800
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,500
Think he's gonna
shoot his way out?

801
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
Well, i don't want to be the
only gun in there if he does.

802
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,600
Please.

803
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,700
Brian.

804
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,400
I want you
to show me your hands.

805
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,900
Hands, brian!

806
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,100
Stop! Stop there, please.

807
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,100
Who is she?

808
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,000
She was my first.

809
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,300
The minute my feet
hit the ground,

810
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,700
I knew right where
to find her.

811
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
I killed them.

812
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:44,700
You remember.

813
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,800
Everything.

814
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,000
Every moment.

815
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,100
Every...

816
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,800
Tiny detail.

817
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,100
I remember. But...

818
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:02,700
It's still not real.

819
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,400
It's like...

820
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,000
The memories belong
to someone else.

821
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,500
Well, maybe in a way
they do.

822
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,700
But you still have to pay
for what's been done.

823
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,100
If i'm gonna be put to death,

824
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,600
I might as well die
right here.

825
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:20,700
Brian.

826
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,600
The court
may show you mercy,

827
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,000
But you have to earn it.

828
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:27,100
If you believe you're a
different person, then prove it

829
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,700
And do the right thing.

830
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,700
It's over.

831
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,900
Matloff's pleading out.

832
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,300
Congratulations.

833
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,400
I couldn't have done it
without you.

834
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,800
First round's on me.

835
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,300
No, we're gonna take a rain
check. We got a long drive.

836
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,200
Sure.

837
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:07,900
Another time.

838
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,100
- Lock up when you leave.
- We will.

839
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
Darci corbett's father brought
a gun to the courthouse today.

840
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,200
You're kidding.

841
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,700
You think he was serious
about using it?

842
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,300
I think so, yeah.

843
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,000
He was looking
for closure.

844
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,200
You think
he'll get some now?

845
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:30,000
I don't really think so.
I mean,

846
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:32,600
People's emotional lives
aren't linear like that.

847
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,700
To say that a killer's
conviction, one single event

848
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
Can just suddenly
bring peace to a man,

849
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:40,400
I don't-I just don't
think it's possible.

850
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
Well, i guess he has to try.

851
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,500
I mean, when it comes
right down to it,

852
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,800
What choice does he have?

853
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,400
Agent reid.

854
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,000
Sorry, i, uh,
i know it's late,

855
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,100
But, um, i wanted
to give you the news

856
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:57,400
Before it hit the paper.

857
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,200
Matloff's changing
his plea to guilty.

858
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,100
Everyone agreed
to life without parole.

859
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,600
You didn't have to come here.

860
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,600
I also came to return this.

861
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,200
I had them release it
from evidence.

862
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,200
It belonged
to darci's grandmother.

863
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,400
They were very close.

864
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
I couldn't help but notice
the inscription on the back.

865
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,700
"Glory in a flower"?

866
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,700
I'm not familiar.

867
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:27,300
Poetry was something
they shared.

868
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,700
It's wordsworth.

869
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,200
"What though the radiance
that was once so bright

870
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,200
"Be now forever taken
from my sight...

871
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,200
"Though nothing can...

872
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,400
Bring back... "

873
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,100
Thanks.

874
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,900
"Though nothing
can bring back

875
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,900
"The hour of splendor
in the grass,

876
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,700
"Of glory in the flower,

877
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:05,900
"We will grieve not,

878
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,500
"Rather find strength

879
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,400
In what remains behind."
