00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:22,500
Taxi!

5
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,700
Spring street,
spring street station.

6
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,500
Spring street...

7
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,200
Excuse me.

8
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,100
Please.

9
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,800
Hotch.

10
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,100
Hey.

11
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,600
Uh, no, i'm actually still
at the office.

12
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,100
I'm just getting some things-

13
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,900
Whoa, hold on, hold on.

14
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,400
Start from the beginning.

15
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,500
No, we're all familiar
with the case.

16
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,000
When was the latest murder?

17
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,000
Is anything in the m.O. Changed?

18
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,700
So, what's your flight number?

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
No, i'm going to come pick you up.

20
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,300
Yeah, exactly.

21
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,200
I can't have you free
to pick out a crib without me.

22
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,800
Jj, will you get the team together?

23
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,900
We have a case.

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,900
Nothing's come across my desk.

25
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,600
This one came directly to me.

26
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Uh, just don't head
to the airport just yet.

27
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,300
I'll call you as soon as i can.

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,400
Bye.

29
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,900
Don't get comfortable.

30
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,500
There'll be time to debrief
on the plane.

31
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,300
Where are we headed?

32
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:00,900
New york.

33
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,000
Five shooting's in two weeks,

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,400
It's about time we got the call.

35
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,700
I want to take garcia with us.

36
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,100
Hopefully we will get those access
to their surveillance systems.

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,900
What do we know?

38
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,300
All the killings are mid-Day.

39
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,100
Single gun shot to the head
with a.22.

40
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,100
Any witnesses?

41
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,600
No.

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,900
.22-Caliber pistol's only 152 decibels.

43
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,400
New york streets and subways
are routinely well over 100.

44
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,100
It could be people not even
registering the gunshot

45
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,000
Until the unsub's already
leaving the scene.

46
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sound like mob hits.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Except none of them
have ties to organized crime.

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,700
Do they have any connection
to each other?

49
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,600
None they've found.

50
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,200
How about communication with the police?

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,600
Does the unsub try
to make any contact?

52
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,000
Surveillance cameras have captured
video of three of the murders,

53
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,200
This is the latest.

54
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,800
That's the best image they have?

55
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,000
They are all the same.

56
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,700
He wears a hood and
keeps his head down.

57
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:39,800
This guy is bold.

58
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,600
Crowded areas, broad daylight.

59
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,200
So they're completely random?

60
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,400
It seems that way.

61
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,100
Son of sam all over again.

62
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,800
Voltaire said,

63
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,100
The man visited by
ecstasys and visions,

64
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,200
Who takes dreams for realities

65
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,400
Is an enthusiast.

66
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,900
The man who supports his madness
with murder

67
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,200
Is a fanatic.

68
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,800
How come i only get to travel
with you guys like once every two years?

69
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,700
Trust me, it can get old.

70
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:41,600
Oh right, like the way the spa treatments
and five star hotels gets old.

71
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,900
Remember the time we got on board

72
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,700
And they hadn't chilled the cristal?

73
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,200
Ooh. I almost quit the b.A.U. That day.

74
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,900
Okay, you know what?

75
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,000
You guys can joke all you want

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,600
Because i am never leaving the plane.

77
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,200
Victims?

78
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,500
Each killed in a completely
different neighbourhood.

79
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,700
Hell's kitchen, murray hill,

80
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,200
Lower side, china town,

81
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,900
East harlom.

82
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,800
Doesn't make any sense.

83
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,100
There's no common victimology.

84
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,100
No sexual component.

85
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,800
No robbery,
no geographical connection.

86
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,300
Do the police have any leads?

87
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,200
He's killing roughly every two days.

88
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,500
The press is having a field day.

89
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,600
And it sounds like the mood on the street's
getting pretty edgey.

90
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,500
It's a joint fbinypd task force?

91
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,200
Kate joyner heads up the new york field office.

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,200
She's running point on the case

93
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,600
And called me directly.

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,400
Jj, would you tell them
we're ready to go?

95
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,400
Right.

96
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,900
Kate's starting to butt heads
with the lead detectives

97
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,300
And wanted a fresh set of eyes.

98
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,100
Joyner, i know her.

99
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:27,900
She's a brit, right?

100
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,200
Well, dual citizenship.

101
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,000
Her father's british,

102
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,900
Her mother's american.

103
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,100
She was a big deal at scotland yard
before coming to the bureau.

104
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,300
I heard she can be
a little bit of a pain in the ass.

105
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,600
I didn't think so.

106
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,800
You know her?

107
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,900
We liaised when she was still
at scotland yard.

108
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,700
And she's good?

109
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,300
I think we're lucky to have her.

110
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,100
??? We're cleared for takeoff.

111
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,400
Please take your seats.

112
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,500
Can you have someone run to my flat,

113
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,000
Get me an extra set of clothes?

114
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,800
And tell forensics i don't want to just cross-Check
with conntticuec and new jersey.

115
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,300
I want interpol as well.

116
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,700
Has the b.A.U. Arrived yet?

117
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,900
They should be here soon.

118
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,700
Shelly, can you get me the commissioner?

119
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,500
Never mind. Hold the call.

120
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:26,900
Is it just me
or does she look exactly like haley?

121
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,400
Kate.

122
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,600
Aaron.

123
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,700
How have you been?

124
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,700
Well, thank you.

125
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,600
This is my team.

126
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,200
Kate joyner,

127
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,600
This is david rossi,

128
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,500
Emily prentiss,

129
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,300
Jennifer jareau,

130
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,100
Penelope garcia, derek morgan,

131
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,200
And spencer reid.

132
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,700
Thanks for being here.

133
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,200
Anything that you need,
just tell me.

134
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,200
Please don't stand on protocol.

135
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
What can you tell us about
the city's surveillance system?

136
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,200
Um, it's run by the nypd.

137
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,500
It's still in the infant stages.

138
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,100
It's been rather controversial.

139
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,600
American privacy laws.

140
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,600
Um, but they've had some success.

141
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,900
And i'll have complete access?

142
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,500
They're already expecting you.

143
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,600
Shelley?

144
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,300
I'd like to get a map of the borough.

145
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,100
I want to do a comprehensive
geographical profile of the area

146
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,700
In order to ascertain the unsub's mental map

147
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,800
Before it's clouded by our own linkage blindness.

148
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,000
I see you brought your own computer.

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,000
Detectives brustin and cooper.

150
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,700
I'll let you do the introductions.

151
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,800
You caught the first shooting?

152
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,600
They've all been in different precincts.

153
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,100
It wasn't until the third murder
that anyone even made the connection.

154
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,600
I guess this is where we play nice

155
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
And ask you what you need.

156
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,000
I'll let you all
figure out what that is.

157
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,100
I just ask that you run everything
back through me.

158
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,700
It's been my experience that
having one butt on the line is enough.

159
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,300
Yes, ma'am.

160
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,900
Can i have a word with you in private?

161
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,000
Sure.

162
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,200
Excuse me.

163
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
They, um...

164
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Liaised when she was at scotland yard.

165
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,300
Of course.

166
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,200
So you're getting resistance from nypd?

167
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,900
It's nothing i wasn't expecting.

168
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,900
They're good detectives,

169
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,800
Just no self-Respecting cop

170
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,400
Wants to have his ass kicked
by some broad with a posh british accent.

171
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,900
So what's going on?

172
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,100
What can you tell me about derek morgan?

173
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
Hey, so, uh, what's your partner's problem?

174
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,800
Uh, well...

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Well, by the fourth murder the fbi was brought in.

176
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,000
Good.

177
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,700
We can use all the help we can get.

178
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,000
But, uh, all of a sudden she's taking meetings
with the mayor

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,600
And calling in you all
without us knowing anything about it.

180
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,000
We're only here to help.

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
Think of us as a resource.

182
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,400
Ok.

183
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Profile me.

184
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,300
What am i thinking?

185
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,100
It's never gonna happen.

186
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:48,800
No offense,

187
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,500
But we've had 5 murders.

188
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,500
Hope it gets better than that.

189
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,800
You must be fbi.

190
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,600
Lisa bartleby.

191
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,500
Penelope garcia.

192
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,300
May i?

193
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,000
I hardly ever get visitors.

194
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,000
You'll hardly know i'm here.

195
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,500
What's your operating system?

196
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,700
Um, linux os with 6 gigs of ram.

197
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,500
And a dual quad core 3 gigahertz processor

198
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,900
With a geforce 8800 ultra extreme vid card

199
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:53,500
And a cisco asa 5500 firewall.

200
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,200
Yeah.

201
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,500
Bitchin'.
How many cameras?

202
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Uh, 4,468,

203
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,800
Not including the ones that only run
in the housing projects.

204
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,600
And all the footage is stored?

205
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,900
Catalogued and digitized.

206
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,500
Beautiful.

207
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,000
'Cause my boss man wants me
to send him a file

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,800
So he can run facial recognition software

209
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,400
On each of the crime scenes.

210
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,500
Um, i've already enhanced all of the photos
as much as i can.

211
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,600
No, i'm talking about using it

212
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,600
On the crowd
immediately after the shootings.

213
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,200
This is icky,  but these creeps,

214
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,500
They sometimes like to come back

215
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,300
And watch the police deal
with their handiwork.

216
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,200
And...

217
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,400
Voila.

218
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,500
Can i ask you a question?

219
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,400
When was the last time you went home
and got some sleep?

220
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,500
None of us are going to sleep
until this is over.

221
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,000
Who in the hell thinks they can
get away with murder

222
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,800
In the middle of the day
in new york city?

223
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,800
Someone patient

224
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,600
Who waits for the one
who gets separated from the flock.

225
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,400
Bang.

226
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,300
Is that the spot?

227
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,800
Yeah. Thereabouts.

228
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
Are we boring you?

229
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,900
Look, i know you don't like ssa joyner.

230
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
Fine. I get it.

231
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,000
But we're here to do a job.

232
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,300
Have any of your people ever been cops?

233
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,000
Chicago.

234
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,600
Then you'll understand.

235
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,900
I take it real personal

236
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,800
If something like this happens
in my city.

237
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,900
I was a beat cop during the son of sam.

238
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,100
This is worse.

239
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,200
He's not just going after one type.

240
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,300
He's going after everybody.

241
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,800
And i need everybody
working on this case,

242
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,100
Taking it personally.

243
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,300
You have that.

244
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,100
We'll see.

245
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,500
How long have you been doing this?

246
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,500
Uh, about 6 months.

247
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,000
I wish i could tell you
it gets easier.

248
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,200
Yeah, well, i'm used to
pulling footage up for muggings,

249
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,600
Maybe robberies.

250
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,600
Watching someone get shot in the head...

251
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,700
You know what helps me?

252
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,200
You make it your own.

253
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,400
You know? You...

254
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,200
Separate yourself

255
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,600
From what you see on the screen.

256
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,000
This isn't exactly, uh...

257
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Regulation.

258
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,100
Well, then thank god it's only us in here.

259
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,700
Do you want to see a superfox?

260
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,500
What camera's on the last crime scene?

261
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,000
Derek morgan...

262
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Lisa bartleby.

263
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,400
Lisa bartleby,

264
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,100
Derek morgan.

265
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,700
This guy's definitely
not afraid to get up close and personal.

266
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,000
Or be visible.

267
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,200
If you watch the tape,

268
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,500
He ducks his head the second
he steps off the train.

269
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,800
So he knows when he's being filmed.

270
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
Well, we've had glimpses, but the...

271
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,800
Descriptions have been sketchy.

272
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Some people said
he's a light-Skinned black man,

273
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,500
Asian, puerto rican,

274
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,300
Basically every homeboy in the city.

275
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,000
Ballistics were the same for every shooting?

276
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,800
We checked the records back 10 years.

277
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,200
The gun's never been recycled.

278
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,300
22s aren't exactly the weapon of choice
these days.

279
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,200
Unless you're israeli intelligence.

280
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,500
That's what the mossad uses for
all their political assassinations.

281
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,100
All i know is this guy's organized.

282
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He studies the cameras,

283
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
Carries a gun that's easy to conceal.

284
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
He knows what he's doing.

285
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,300
We're gonna need records
over the last 6 months

286
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,500
For any arrests on gun violence
or gun possession

287
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,600
In every borough except the ones
where the shootings have taken place.

288
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,900
Uh...i don't get it.

289
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,600
He won't strike near where he lives.

290
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,700
What makes you so sure?

291
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,900
It's anti-Geographical profiling.

292
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Now it's anti-Geographical profiling?

293
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,500
Yeah, come on.

294
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,400
You wonder why we're so skeptical?

295
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,600
This unsub's organized.

296
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,100
He strikes at the same time of day.

297
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,400
He knows where the cameras are placed.

298
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,200
That means he's doing his own
pre-Surveillance.

299
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,000
A need-Motivated killer operates
within his own comfort zone.

300
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
An organized killer with some other motivation

301
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,200
Will make sure to strike outside that zone.

302
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,400
Not where he lives.

303
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,300
Exactly.

304
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,300
Unfortunately,

305
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,400
That means that every other neighborhood in the city

306
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,000
Has a reason to be terrified.

307
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Excuse me.

308
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,300
Pretzel, no mustard.

309
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,000
Uniforms are rounding up witnesses.

310
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:47,200
It doesn't seem like
anyone got a clean look.

311
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
It's over in a flash.

312
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,900
He's probably gone before anyone even
realizes what's happening.

313
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,400
Is this what it felt like
during the son of sam?

314
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,100
First we realized that if the violence
was truly random,

315
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,900
There was almost no way of stopping it.

316
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,100
It seems like these people
have figured that out.

317
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,300
From the placement of that camera,

318
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,500
Odds are the only view
they're gonna get

319
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,600
Is the back of his head.

320
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,000
Let's not be too quick to decide

321
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,800
What we do or don't have.

322
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,000
Whoo!

323
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,900
The duchess of work has spoken.

324
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,300
You mind telling me why
i'm catching attitude from her?

325
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,400
Fbi brass has made it clear to her

326
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,900
That if she doesn't bring this case home,

327
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,200
She's gonna be reassigned.

328
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,000
And you are at the top
of the list to replace her.

329
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,200
You're kidding me.

330
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,100
Why should you be surprised?

331
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,200
You're good at your job.

332
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,400
People notice that.

333
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,100
What happened to the bureau
patting itself on the back

334
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,000
For stealing her away
from scotland yard?

335
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,100
I don't know.

336
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,900
Politics here are different.

337
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,800
And you can see she doesn't pull punches.

338
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,100
6 murders and he's finally
communicating with us.

339
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,700
What's that?

340
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,200
That's a tarot card.

341
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,700
Death.

342
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:57,300
Isn't that a little on the nose,

343
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,700
Even for a psycho?

344
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,500
So we think this guy's into spiritual garbage?

345
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,400
If he is, \he certainly doesn't know tarot.

346
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,200
The death card doesn't
actually signify physical death.

347
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,600
It's more of a transformation
from one place to another--

348
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,700
A job promotion
or a marriage.

349
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,900
So if he's not telling us
he's into fortune-Telling,

350
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,800
What's with the card?

351
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,700
The d.C. Sniper left the exact same card

352
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,900
At one of his scenes.

353
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,800
So this unsub must see himself in that role.

354
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,800
He's thriving off creating a panic.

355
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,700
More important,
he studies other cases.

356
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,800
He's telling us...

357
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,900
He knows we're here.

358
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,100
What have we got?

359
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,300
The latest shooting.

360
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,000
This was the previous murder.

361
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,500
Ok, do you see anything weird here?

362
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,200
He sprints off in one
and walks calmly in the other.

363
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,700
It's two entirely different demeanors.

364
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,800
6 kills in,
his behavior should be set.

365
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,800
Look at this.

366
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,500
Garcia, are you still there?

367
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,600
Would i ever leave you?

368
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,400
Ok, check it out.

369
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,700
I did a digital perspective analysis rendering

370
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,100
On the shootings where we have footage.

371
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,500
Now, the first two are inconclusive,

372
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,500
But the last two i found something
tres weird.

373
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,000
Your calm walking type,

374
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,900
He is about 6'1".

375
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,000
But your sprinter,

376
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,300
He's like 5'9",

377
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,700
5'10", tops.

378
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,200
We've got more than one unsub.

379
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,400
So, we have more than one unsub.

380
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,500
What does that tell us?

381
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,400
Most teams stick together.

382
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,500
Uh, ng and lake,

383
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,300
The krays.

384
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,200
Bittaker and norris.

385
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,000
They don't usually kill separately.

386
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,100
Could be some kind of gang initiation.

387
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
Gangs will kill you if they encroach
on your territory,

388
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,500
Not random people all over the city.

389
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,900
I'll coordinate with the gang taskforce,

390
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,700
Make sure we have an overview
by morning.

391
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,100
Do you think we have enough
for a working profile?

392
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,300
Broad strokes.

393
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,900
Dave, you and reid talk to the agents here.

394
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,200
Morgan and prentiss, brief the police
when each shift comes on duty tomorrow.

395
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,800
I think we should get out on the streets.

396
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,100
I brought you here to create a profile.

397
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:34,200
Which we can give in the morning,

398
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,100
And then they can share it
with the afternoon shift.

399
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,700
We've allocated every extra man we have.

400
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
This is new york city.

401
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,900
It's not like a few more people
is going to blanket the city.

402
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,700
I understand it's a long shot,

403
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,600
But these guys, they hit at mid-Day.

404
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,700
We could target ingress and egress
to particular neighborhoods.

405
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,300
Position us near express stops--

406
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,300
- 14th, 42nd, 59th--
- Morgan,

407
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,600
It's not your call.

408
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,600
I'd like to join you in the profile

409
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,200
If that's not stepping on your toes.

410
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,200
No problem.

411
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,300
Let's see it again.

412
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,800
Look at this.

413
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,700
Late edition doesn't miss a beat.

414
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,700
Jj.

415
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,600
Will.

416
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,300
Took a shot and flew to d.C.,

417
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,000
But that didn't work out.

418
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,400
I figured a train ride to new york
was only a few more hours.

419
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,500
Detective.

420
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,000
I'm sorry for showing up like this.

421
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I know you're working.

422
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,700
But, um...

423
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,400
I can't stand you being on this case

424
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,700
And me not being there.

425
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,300
Not with what's going on.

426
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,300
Is there a problem?

427
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,700
I'm pregnant.

428
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh my god, jj,

429
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
Congratulations!

430
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,600
I've asked jj to marry me.

431
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,800
Will.

432
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,600
We're working out some kinks.

433
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,000
We'll give you both some privacy.

434
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,700
Hotch

435
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,100
Jj, you could have told me.

436
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,000
I know.

437
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,700
I understand if you need to take some time.

438
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,000
No, i want to be here.

439
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,300
Okay.

440
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
???

441
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,500
Are you crazy?

442
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,800
I told you i couldn't get any personal time.

443
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,900
Come back to dc with me tomorrow.

444
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,700
You're not serious.

445
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,100
They know now.

446
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,000
They'd understand.

447
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,200
Will, we're covering a case

448
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,800
With six murders.

449
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,400
Exactly.

450
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,000
Your job's too dangerous now.

451
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,400
Yeah, exactly like yours.

452
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,000
Are you going to give up your shield?

453
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,100
Look, i love the gesture,

454
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,400
And i love the romance,

455
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,400
But we're both going to be parents, will.

456
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,500
Neither one of us has, exactly a typical job.

457
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,600
The first thing a cop does when she gets pregnant,

458
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,300
Is she takes herself out of the field.

459
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,300
Okay, you know what?

460
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,300
We only have until 7,

461
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,800
So can we just argue about names and cribs?

462
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,400
Only if you let me win.

463
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,100
Not a chance.

464
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,200
Okay, let's start with what we know.

465
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:39,900
For these unsubs, it's not personal.

466
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,100
It's not about sex, it's not about greed.

467
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,100
Which is why we think there's
something bigger at play here.

468
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,300
This isn't random.

469
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,900
There has to be a motive.

470
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,200
Now our first theory is that we are dealing with a team.

471
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,000
In the case of the d.C.Snipers,

472
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,600
There was actually one intended victim.

473
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
John mohamed wanted to kill his ex-Wife,

474
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,300
But he knew if he did,

475
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,600
He'd be the crime suspect.

476
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,700
So he created a spree in order to
mask his primary motivation.

477
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,400
What if the deaths got ott their scenes.

478
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,700
Just like this unsub.

479
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,100
We believe our unsubs have studyed that case.

480
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,800
They are opening a line of communication.

481
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,200
Hold on.

482
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
So now we have these guys playing games

483
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,800
Just because you are here.

484
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,600
We are just saying the unsubs are sophisticated enough

485
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,000
To study other crimes.

486
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,400
That doesn't answer the question.

487
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Joe, easy.

488
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,500
Hear them out.

489
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,900
Hey, i got request for gun permits up 200% in my precinct.

490
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,700
This whole city is about to go up,

491
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,199
We all need to deal with that.

492
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
Hey, listen, you're right.

493
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,600
If the card was left because of us

494
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,700
Then yes, they are playing games.

495
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,500
But what that tells us is

496
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,600
At least one of them has some intelligence.

497
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,400
And like i said, they know about other cases.

498
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,000
He's also studyed the placement
of the surveillance systems

499
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Well enough to avoid detection.

500
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:46,500
Most teams have a dominant and sub missive member.

501
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,500
Because of the relative intelligence of these unsubs

502
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,400
And the fact that they stick o a set time patternt ,

503
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,100
We believe at least one of them has a steady job.

504
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,900
We've asked the police to canvas their precincts.

505
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,700
Check businesses that open and close around the time of the shootings.

506
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:03,100
We're hoping someone will be able to identify a father/son

507
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,750
Or co-Workers that fit the dominant sub missive profile.

508
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,600
And what's the other theory?

509
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,600
It's less likely, but it could be some sort of gang i initiation.

510
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,800
We've asked the police to put every available undercover

511
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,300
On the streets.

512
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,700
These are all own gang members in manhattan.

513
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,300
Most of them are out of china town and clinton.

514
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,700
We'd like you to study these

515
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,200
And keep an eye out for anyone who looks suspicious.

516
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,700
Those i.D. Numbers stay behind
when the agents are finished,

517
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,800
I'll give you your assignments.

518
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,500
Like we said, we think there's something big art play here.

519
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,300
Talk to the people on your beats.

520
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Save sparks and pray this thing ain't random.

521
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
Cameras aren't designed to prevent crime.

522
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,950
Supposed to help us catch the perp after the fact.

523
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,900
I got one.

524
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,100
Is there anyone nearby?

525
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,500
Negative.

526
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,000
This is a surveillance command centre.

527
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,700
We have a possible murder suspect

528
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,650
At the subway platform on 59th and lex.

529
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Okay.

530
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,400
Hotchner.

531
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,600
It looked like it could be one of our guys.

532
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,600
What's going on?

533
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,400
We have eyes on one of them.

534
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,300
He is on the 59th and lex.

535
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,100
We could have been right there.

536
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,600
He's got a gun.

537
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
Oh my god.

538
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,900
He shot her.

539
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,800
Where the hell are the police?

540
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,400
This is kate joyner with the fbi.

541
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,600
We have a murder suspect

542
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,800
Subway platform 59 and this lex.

543
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,000
He is getting away.

544
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,450
Garcia. Can you get eyes on him aboveground?

545
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,400
He's heading west on 59th street.

546
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
If he makes it to the park,

547
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,800
We've lost him.

548
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,050
We've lost the visual.

549
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,100
Are the police on the scene?

550
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,700
Negative.

551
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,900
We could have had that guy.

552
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,300
Even if we were on that platform,

553
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,300
Odds are he wouldhave known he was isolated.

554
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,100
Maybe, but it was worth
taking a shot.

555
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,500
We had every available man
on the streets.

556
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,800
And i suggested to you that
you use this team.

557
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,800
Second guessing doesn't do us any good.

558
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,300
Hotch, how am i supposed to look
these cops in the eye

559
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,800
And tell them we are here to help them?

560
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,000
We are here to present a profile.

561
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,100
Let's we need to do.

562
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,000
I said put us in express stops.

563
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,800
14th, 42nd, 59th

564
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,200
- That's exactly where they hit.
- It's not your place

565
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,700
To have
this discussion.

566
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,400
My place?

567
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,200
You need to back off.

568
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,500
We got seven bodies, man.

569
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Which is exactly why we need to stay focused.

570
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,800
Focused?

571
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,800
From where i'm standing, all you're focus is on her.

572
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,300
Take a walk, now.

573
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,750
I know.

574
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,700
I was out of line.

575
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,100
You get too emotionaly involved sometimes.

576
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,700
I know the feeling.

577
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:13,100
I just felt like hotch was taking her side.

578
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,000
There are no sides here.

579
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,600
I know.

580
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,800
The word is, they have an
eye on you

581
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,100
If jayner gets canned.

582
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,100
People talk.

583
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,400
If she were to get fired,

584
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,050
It would be because we didn't
solve this case.

585
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,500
Rossi, i hope you are not saying

586
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,300
You think i want her to fail.

587
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:32,300
Of course not.

588
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,200
I've never seen you push a
superior like that before.

589
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
So would you take the job?

590
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,400
I don't know.

591
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,300
It might be nice to finally be
the one making the calls.

592
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,300
And dealing with the
politics of running a field office?

593
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,400
That doesn't seem like you.

594
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,000
It wears people out, man.

595
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,100
Look at gideon.

596
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,500
That man was the best,

597
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:04,500
And in the end, he simply ran away.

598
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,600
I mean hotc hflt hasn't even
thought about cracking a smile in over a year.

599
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,100
That man has to take a personal day

600
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,900
Just so he can have a conversation with his own kid.

601
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,900
What about you?

602
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,100
How many times you been married?

603
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,400
I get it.

604
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,300
But i'll make you a deal.

605
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,200
If i think you're losing it,

606
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,200
I'll pull you out myself.

607
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,700
But right now,

608
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:32,200
I see someone
who wants to get back on the job.

609
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,400
Or is there another reason

610
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,200
Why you haven't even touched that beer?

611
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Listen, um, about before.

612
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,800
You spoke your mind.
I respect that.

613
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,600
Jj reid and printess are at the crime scene
with the detectives.

614
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,700
It's the first time they've killed
two days in a row.

615
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,600
They are speeding up.

616
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,100
Your analyst went over
the latest footage.

617
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,100
This is a different shooter
from the last two.

618
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,800
There's three of them now?

619
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,600
Who the hell are these guys?

620
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,900
I want you all out on the
street tomorrow.

621
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,700
What are we missing?

622
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,700
When we first saw this case,

623
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,000
What did it remind us of?

624
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:32,900
Sam.

625
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,900
Same kind of unsung.

626
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,500
Random shootings.
Not need-Driven,

627
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,700
No sexual component.

628
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,500
Expect that berkowitz admitted that
he returns to the crimes scenes

629
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,699
Days later to masturbate.

630
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,400
Exactly.

631
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,700
So you're thinking
if the dominant unsub
has a similar m.O...

632
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,400
We get garcia to study
the footage and

633
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,500
We see if the same person keeps returning to the crime scene

634
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,400
In the days following the shootings.

635
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,400
All we've been looking at right now

636
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,400
Are the immediate aftermath of the crimes.

637
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,800
Worth a shot.

638
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,700
We'll hit the street tomorrow.

639
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,500
Dave will you grab reid and go over the profile

640
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,400
And make sure we didn't leave anything out?

641
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
Thanks.

642
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,700
Okay, people, talk to me.

643
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:14,200
Roll call, 59th street.

644
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Check.

645
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,800
Carol square.

646
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,900
Check.

647
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,500
Chamber street.

648
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,700
Check.

649
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,100
72nd street.

650
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,100
Check.

651
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Detectives.

652
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,500
Son of sam this case still pisses you off

653
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,300
Like it was yesterday.

654
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,800
Yeah, does.

655
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,800
There've been a lot of killers in the city.

656
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,700
Why him?

657
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,200
He was laughing at us,
and we couldn't catch him.

658
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:41,800
The only way we grabbed him
was through a parking ticket.

659
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,300
What are you thinking?

660
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
He hasn't contacted us again.

661
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,400
So-.

662
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,700
This doesn't fit.

663
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,400
These unsubs are organized.

664
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,500
They use presurveillance.

665
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,800
They strike in the heart of the day,

666
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,200
Yet they haven't done anything to seek out media attention.

667
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,600
And then this.

668
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,200
You said it was to tell you
they knew you were here.

669
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:05,800
We profiled opening a line of communication to create panic.

670
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,800
But if that was the case, his correspondence should escalate.

671
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,100
After they left their death card mohamed

672
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,000
And- Demanded an atm card a million dollars

673
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,600
And a bank account to taunt police.

674
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,300
Berko wits wrote letters about random hits in the city

675
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,100
Sdrooik himself as a monster.

676
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,200
They are more disciplined.

677
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,100
The fact they haven't contacted the press,

678
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:27,400
Tells me that this was private.

679
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,400
It's only for us.

680
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,000
So what does that mean?

681
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,200
They are wrapping up to something.

682
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,000
And they wanttous know that
they are watching us.

683
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,700
You saw both these traits
completely out of context,

684
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,300
What would be the first
profile to pop into your head?

685
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,600
Who do we have out on the streets?

686
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,500
Talk.

687
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,100
Garcia ,do you have eyes on
everyone on the team?

688
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,600
I can get them.

689
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,600
So we are on the cover,

690
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,900
Maybe we should, you know, act like a couple.

691
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,800
Are you still working this
tired sexual tension angle?

692
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,000
I don't know, you're the fortune teller,
you tell me.

693
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,100
You want to know what
profiling is, really?

694
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,700
Why do i have a feeling i'm
going to hear no matter what i say.

695
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,600
It's just noticing behaviour.

696
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,200
I'm about to hear about mine.

697
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,600
Is that the deal?

698
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Okay.

699
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,400
When we first met, when your partner was sarcastic

700
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,300
And said yes, ma'am, you instinctively reached for your detective shield

701
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,000
As if you were protecting it.

702
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:31,100
That tells me you don't like
him disrespecting the chain of command,

703
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,400
But you are also loyal,

704
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,200
So you didn't say something to him.

705
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,700
I'd say you were military.

706
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,300
Probably an officer.

707
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:40,700
Public and sensor in public, right?

708
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,000
You're right-Handed,

709
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,800
But you have two different colour pen
marks on your left hand.

710
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,500
I guess you have a toddler at home

711
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,000
Just learning how to draw.

712
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,100
You don't wear a ring.

713
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,900
And you were quick to flirt with me.

714
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,900
So, you're happy to let people
think you are a player,

715
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,100
But if i took you up on it,

716
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,700
You would run for the hills.

717
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:59,000
Because you love your wife,

718
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,900
And you would never actually cheat on her.

719
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,400
You might just solve this case yet.

720
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,800
Okay. This is not good.

721
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:18,500
Why not?

722
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,600
I'm doing what you asked.

723
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,800
I'm looking at the footage to see

724
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,100
If i see the same person coming back to the crime scene

725
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,400
In the days after the shooting.

726
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,100
Right.

727
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:27,400
So i find the camera with
the widest angle on the scene.

728
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,700
So you have to sift
through hundreds.

729
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,100
Exactly. But-.

730
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,400
Someone's hacked in.

731
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:25,600
- Garcia.
- I'm on it.I'm on it

732
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,400
16 and this broadway,
he's running east on 16th.

733
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,900
He's headed our way.

734
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,600
Move, move!

735
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,300
Get out of the way!

736
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,500
Cooper?

737
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,100
Garcia!

738
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,400
We've got an officer down,

739
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,900
16th west of union square.

740
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,100
Let me see.

741
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,800
Okay, you're going to be okay.

742
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,300
Garcia, can you see us?

743
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,000
We have an officer down.

744
00:35:26,310 --> 00:35:27,610
Stay with me.

745
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,900
It's going to be okay.

746
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,700
Cooper, stay with me

747
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,700
Are you okay?

748
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Is he going to make it?

749
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,200
I don't know, he lost a lot of blood.

750
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,500
He's not going to live to
tell us anything.

751
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,800
Any o.D. On him?

752
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Nothing.

753
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,500
This is not good.

754
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,200
I shouldn't have had to shoot him.

755
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,400
Emily, he shot a cop.

756
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,700
You did what you had to do.

757
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,800
No, not that.
I mean, he was ahead of us.

758
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,900
He would have gotten away,

759
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,900
But he stoped and waited.

760
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,900
So he felt trapped, figured
he'd shoot his way out?

761
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,400
I don't know.

762
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,700
Tell me about his behaviour.

763
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,900
Was he acting panicked?
Was he winded?

764
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,700
His hands were steady.

765
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,600
His eyes were dead calm.

766
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,599
I mean these guys have been
hyper individual lent,

767
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,800
Organized.

768
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,100
They do presurveillance what are the odds

769
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,300
They would shoot somebody two blocks

770
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
From where me and coop standing?

771
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,900
You think he deliberately shot someone

772
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,100
Where he could see cops?

773
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,700
What if he did?

774
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,300
What if they chose this spot

775
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,900
Because we were here.

776
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,000
What are you thinking?

777
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,100
He had no i.D. On him.

778
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,000
He waited until we caught up to him.

779
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
He was strangely calm.

780
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,200
It's almost like
suicide by cop.

781
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,200
Why?

782
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,700
Why would he do that?

783
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,200
I don't know.

784
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,100
Maybe to make us think
everything was finished.

785
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,300
We need to walk back
through this profile.

786
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,600
We think we might have a serious problem.

787
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,200
What is it?

788
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,700
We have multiple unsubs.

789
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:13,500
They are disciplined.

790
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,399
They are using cops and surveillance.

791
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,700
They know the fbi movements.

792
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,000
There's a hierarchy.

793
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,400
What does that usually equal?

794
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,800
Terrorism.

795
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
So how does this work?

796
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,300
The murderer simulate a bombing.

797
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,100
In order to gauge police response time.

798
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,000
Which case they know when
to bring in a second bomb.

799
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,200
First round of civilians

800
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,600
Followed by a second wave of
emergency responders.

801
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,100
It's crazy but ingenious.

802
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,300
They get a practice run and if someone catchs a shooter

803
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,800
They have a murderer that won't compromise.

804
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,000
It's lo-Fi.

805
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,100
Smartest way to plan for a terrorist event.

806
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,200
Creating panic ensures

807
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,900
That they see the most urgent
response time short of a bombing.

808
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,000
So there's been seven
different shooters?

809
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,600
Having followers
do the shootings would ensure

810
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,000
They're willing to kill or be killed for the cause.

811
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,200
Fits the profile.

812
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,000
There is something larger at play.

813
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
It simulates a gang i initiation.

814
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,800
Especially if they are home
grown they had a chance to prove themselves.

815
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,400
I think they are targeting
points of entry.

816
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,200
All the murders are taking
place near a bridge or tunnel.

817
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:18,000
Holland tunnel, midtown
tunnel manhattan bridge.

818
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
If bombs went off emergency response
would shut down

819
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,900
Any ability to get in or out of this city.

820
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,800
It would be like people are
trapped on the island.

821
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,500
Keep in mind still a theory
just like any profile.

822
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,200
Talktous garcia.

823
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,000
We got a problem.

824
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,100
I went through and checked off
4468 cameras.

825
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,700
They've hacked into the
surveillance system.

826
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,200
They have footage of every crime scene

827
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,600
They've been watching since the beginning.

828
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,000
How could we not have caught that?

829
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,700
They were smart not system wide

830
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,200
Had to check each camera individually.

831
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,900
This is from every crime scene?

832
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,900
I'm afraid so.

833
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:49,700
They hacked into one camera at every scene.

834
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,700
Thanks, garcia.

835
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,600
So much for theory.

836
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,400
We need to hit the ground running.

837
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,600
I'm going to head to the hospital

838
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,800
I'll check on cooper
and brief detective brustin.

839
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,500
Good. Dave, will you
go talk to the commissioner,

840
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
And morgan you brief online security?

841
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,900
Jj and i will talk to
the port authority police.

842
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,800
Kate and i will go talk to the mayor
and we'll meet back here as soon as possible.

843
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,100
One advantage
that we have right now

844
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,300
Is they don't we know they're watching.

845
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,700
Agent jareau.

846
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:29,700
Thank you.

847
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
Will?

848
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,000
He's going home to new orleans tonight.

849
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,700
You okay?

850
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,200
He doesn't want to be in the way.

851
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,100
He's quitting his job?

852
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,400
Do you need everyone in the field?

853
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,800
Reid, you can go brief port
authority police by yourself.

854
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,400
Jj you run point from the office.

855
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,600
Why don't you go back to the hotel,

856
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,500
Tell will what's going on then get back in line.

857
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,300
Yes, sir.

858
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,700
And jj,

859
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,250
Congratulations.

860
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,000
How's cooper doing?

861
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,300
He's still in surgery.

862
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,150
It doesn't look good.

863
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,700
We think we know what this is about.
