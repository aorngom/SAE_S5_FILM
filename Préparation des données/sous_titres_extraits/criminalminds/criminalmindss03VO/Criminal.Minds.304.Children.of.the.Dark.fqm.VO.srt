1
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:03,200
yeah. a bone spur.

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,335
i know! it's ridiculous.

3
00:00:05,705 --> 00:00:07,720
a-and tom wants to have
another baby.

4
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:08,650
did i mention this?

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,425
let's see.
i-i'm 38 years old,

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,470
and i have runaway bones
growing out of my feet.

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,595
pull yourself togeer.

8
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,017
i can't stand to see
an 8-year-old cry.

9
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:21,716
19?
you're guessing again.

10
00:00:21,717 --> 00:00:23,355
because i don't know.

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,065
because you're
not focusing.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,300
15.

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,795
mm-mmm.

14
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:30,840
damn it.

15
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,860
hey, what kind
of language is that?

16
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,900
mom says it
all the time.

17
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:36,151
mom is a grown-up.

18
00:00:36,218 --> 00:00:37,717
i know. i always
wanted a girl,

19
00:00:37,784 --> 00:00:39,905
but now that i have
2 boys, it just seems--

20
00:00:40,051 --> 00:00:40,984
oh, damn it.

21
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,290
no. i just spilled
some wine.

22
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,205
well, it's doable.

23
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,235
i got my whole life
ahead of me, right?

24
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,000
lynn?

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,955
hello?

26
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,015
great.

27
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,915
tom, could you get that?

28
00:01:00,005 --> 00:01:02,917
i-it's probably carol returning the dish
from the potluck.

29
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,070
you...focus.

30
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,730
hey. it just ran out
in front of the car.

31
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:19,884
is it yours?

32
00:01:19,951 --> 00:01:21,017
oh, my gosh.

33
00:01:21,484 --> 00:01:23,815
uh, no.
we don't have a cat.

34
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:25,600
could it maybe be
one of your neighbor's?

35
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:27,451
i don't--
i guess it's possible.

36
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:28,405
is it dead?

37
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:30,215
hayden,
go in the other room.

38
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:32,784
well, it looks like
there's a tag.

39
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,709
oh, don't touch it.
it might have a disease.

40
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:36,380
there's a number.
do you think, uh,

41
00:01:36,385 --> 00:01:38,200
maybe i could use
your telephone?

42
00:01:38,205 --> 00:01:39,340
it's not working.

43
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,525
what do you mean
it's not working?

44
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,560
i don't know. it died.
maybe the batteries.

45
00:01:43,484 --> 00:01:44,955
you can use my cell.
thanks.

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,617
hey, those are some
pretty nice clubs.

47
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,555
you must be
a good player.

48
00:01:48,754 --> 00:01:51,505
heh. yeah, nice clubs,
but my game is a wreck.

49
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,680
that's weird.
there's no signal.

50
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,675
you got a bag?

51
00:01:55,423 --> 00:01:56,280
a bag?

52
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,790
like she said,
it might have a disease.

53
00:01:58,924 --> 00:02:00,650
oh. yeah, sure.
just a second.

54
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,390
y-you wanna step in?

55
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:03,660
yeah. thank you.

56
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,520
i don't see why
we have to get him a bag.

57
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,023
it's called
being neighborly.

58
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,360
he's not our neighbor.

59
00:02:13,891 --> 00:02:15,309
do we have to
argue about this?

60
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,310
well, excuse me for not wanting a dead animal
brought into my house.

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,684
sorry. my friend
is a little shook up.

62
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:27,820
he was driving when we,
you know...

63
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,195
yeah, sure.

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,970
whoa.

65
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:33,865
little guy's a load.

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,915
should maybe double-bag it.

67
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,963
look, guys, uh, we were
just getting ready to eat.

68
00:02:38,964 --> 00:02:41,145
oh, a family dinner.
that's nice.

69
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,595
come home from
playing golf,

70
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,395
have a nice meal,
nice family.

71
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,500
you're a lucky guy.

72
00:02:45,505 --> 00:02:45,930
yeah.

73
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,750
uh, so if you guys
don't mind...

74
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:52,555
well, what are we
supposed to do with the cat?

75
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:55,200
i don't know.
take it to a vet,i guess.

76
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:57,100
what's a vet gonna do?
it's dead.

77
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,325
hey, what kind of
clubs are these anyway?

78
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,700
uh, guys, i don't
want any trouble.

79
00:03:02,705 --> 00:03:03,600
we'll call
the police.

80
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:04,404
how you gonna do that?

81
00:03:05,405 --> 00:03:06,715
you could yell, i guess.

82
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,420
you have to be
real loud, though.

83
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,605
look, this is ridiculous.
you guys get out--

84
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:12,400
hey, don't touch me,
bitch!

85
00:03:12,405 --> 00:03:13,595
hey, who the hell do
you think you--aah!

86
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,405
dad!
boys, get in your room.

87
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:17,100
no, boys.

88
00:03:17,472 --> 00:03:19,135
stay.

89
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,390
the halbert family.

90
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,700
they were murdered
in their home last night

91
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:26,400
in the denver suburb
of cherry creek.

92
00:03:26,405 --> 00:03:28,920
it's the third
home invasion like this in the last month.

93
00:03:28,925 --> 00:03:29,785
they kill everyone.

94
00:03:30,021 --> 00:03:32,260
parents, kids,
pets if they have them.

95
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,265
always families,
nice neighborhoods.

96
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,165
what do they take?

97
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:37,239
nothing they can't
fit in their pockets--

98
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,160
cash, jewelry.

99
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:39,750
hundreds of ways
to get cash and jewels

100
00:03:39,755 --> 00:03:41,460
without killing
entire families.

101
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,835
that's why home invasions are
so hard to profile--

102
00:03:44,005 --> 00:03:44,900
multiple motives.

103
00:03:44,905 --> 00:03:46,437
national statistics
show an uptick

104
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:49,835
in home invasions over the last few years,
18% in colorado.

105
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,938
you know it's bad
if they're inviting us back.

106
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,316
back?

107
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,417
well, things went bad after
the jonbent ramsey case

108
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,200
when a couple of agents
publicly criticized local detectives.

109
00:03:58,205 --> 00:03:59,653
well, they didn't need us to make them
look bad.

110
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,710
and that was in boulder.

111
00:04:00,715 --> 00:04:02,270
yeah, but the statewide
media ran with it,

112
00:04:02,336 --> 00:04:04,020
and it took on
a life of its own.

113
00:04:04,025 --> 00:04:05,770
well, i talked to
a lieutenant nellis.

114
00:04:05,837 --> 00:04:07,249
trust me.
they want our help.

115
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,420
they need it.

116
00:04:08,637 --> 00:04:10,999
the first 2 invasions
were 20 days apart.

117
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,449
this last one
was just 9 days later.

118
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,385
so they're killing in faster cycles,
acquiring a taste.

119
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,909
and getting better
at it every time.

barbara ehrenreich.

128
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:11,369
home invasions
typically involve

129
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,500
the elderly
and single females.

130
00:05:13,505 --> 00:05:15,420
the fact
that entire families are being targeted

131
00:05:15,425 --> 00:05:16,779
suggests
multiple unsubs.

132
00:05:16,846 --> 00:05:17,910
could mean gang-related,

133
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,480
revenge motive,
personal business.

134
00:05:19,545 --> 00:05:20,849
i don't think
any of these victims

135
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,149
are running
in gang circles.

136
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,770
sewing circles,
more like it.

137
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:26,679
p.t.a. moms,
gray-flannel dads--

138
00:05:27,146 --> 00:05:29,046
these guys are
killing the cleavers.

139
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,850
strange.

140
00:05:29,855 --> 00:05:30,740
the pattern?

141
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,879
no, the cleavers.
of all the names

142
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,930
for a 1950s
idyllic tv family,

143
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,072
i mean, it's rife with
violent implication.

144
00:05:37,073 --> 00:05:39,440
kind of makes you wonder
how the writers

145
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:40,810
really felt
about suburbia, huh?

146
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,840
focus, please.

147
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:45,240
uh, ok, what about, um,
class-based uprising?

148
00:05:45,307 --> 00:05:46,340
helter skelter?

149
00:05:46,474 --> 00:05:48,029
there's no graffiti,
no messages,

150
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,800
at least not visible ones.
there's no rituals.

151
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,195
manson's aim was
to start a racwar.

152
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:52,870
there's no proof of
any hate crime here.

153
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:54,960
the parent murders
are brutal, messy.

154
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,863
the instruments vary.
uh, golf club,

155
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,000
kitchen knife, iron.

156
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,107
household implements,
symbols of family.

157
00:06:02,173 --> 00:06:03,239
but the kids were different.

158
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,340
they died by injection,
pentobarbital.

159
00:06:05,347 --> 00:06:07,040
it's a barbiturate
sometimes used

160
00:06:07,107 --> 00:06:08,606
as an anticonvulsant
for epileptics,

161
00:06:08,673 --> 00:06:10,473
anxiety disorders,
and state executions.

162
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:11,897
the invasions
are well planned.

163
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,140
phone lines are cut.
ligature marks show

164
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,649
the parents were
bound and gagged.

165
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,710
look like these guys had
some robbery experience.

166
00:06:18,173 --> 00:06:19,680
and then found
their true calling.

167
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:25,605
no sign of forced entry.

168
00:06:26,507 --> 00:06:28,100
same as the other
2 houses, right?

169
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,180
yeah.

170
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:31,275
so it's late,
and the doorbell rings.

171
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,600
i come over,

172
00:06:33,605 --> 00:06:35,180
and i flip the switch.

173
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,700
huh.

174
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,665
they made it dark.

175
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:49,299
no one sees anything
if they're walking by.

176
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,495
but i can still see
through the peephole.

177
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:00,280
if you look like trouble,
i might not let you in...

178
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,655
but if you look nonthreatening,
maybe i open up.

179
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,800
so the occupants
either knew them,

180
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:07,199
or they lied
their way in.

181
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,463
with this ki of overkill,
there's usually history.

182
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,640
right. if it was just
about eliminating witnesses,

183
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:14,910
it would never
have been so vicious.

184
00:07:15,278 --> 00:07:16,498
this is rage.

185
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,711
you think they know
the families?

186
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,665
it's possible.

187
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,211
and then there's
the kids--

188
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:22,025
tucked in, quiet,

189
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,100
orderly, controlled.

190
00:07:23,102 --> 00:07:26,760
speaks to an introvert
with some capacity for remorse.

191
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,184
2 profiles.
2 unsubs.

192
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,775
have these chairs
been moved?

193
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,017
no. it's all
how we found it.

194
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,616
so they've been positioned

195
00:07:34,683 --> 00:07:36,530
to face the area
where the parents were killed.

196
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,700
everything's been cleared out
like a stage.

197
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:41,085
it's entertainment.

198
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:43,150
they sit and watch
the parents die.

199
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,230
maybe.

200
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,063
i came by about 9:00
to return the pyrex.

201
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,583
no one answered
when i rang the bell,

202
00:07:52,650 --> 00:07:54,045
but lights were on inside.

203
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,540
did you happen to look
in the windows?

204
00:07:57,710 --> 00:07:58,565
not then, no.

205
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,820
i had my cell phone.
i was gonna call,

206
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,067
but i--i couldn't get
a signal, which was strange.

207
00:08:04,134 --> 00:08:05,180
why was that strange?

208
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,800
you always get a signal here.

209
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,415
there's a tower
on the next block.

210
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,060
uh, i left the dish.

211
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,826
this morning,
it was still here...

212
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,615
so i came over.

213
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,529
th-that's when
i looked inside.

214
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:20,620
and you called
the police on your cell.

215
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,770
yeah.

216
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,960
these guys
don't lack confidence.

217
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,500
targeting
entire families is a high-risk endeavor.

218
00:08:27,505 --> 00:08:29,125
it's possible they're
minimizing that risk

219
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,756
by jamming cell phones
inside the house.

220
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,869
no one can call out.

221
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:33,539
high tech. that narrows
the profile, right?

222
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,500
not really.

223
00:08:34,505 --> 00:08:35,838
oh, you can buy
a hand-held jammer online

224
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,435
for what, 100 bucks?

225
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,340
i could use one of those

226
00:08:38,406 --> 00:08:39,315
next time i go
to the movies.

227
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,525
hey, girl.
you're on speaker. behave.

228
00:08:44,739 --> 00:08:46,605
or what, you'll spank me?

229
00:08:49,106 --> 00:08:51,700
so i've been searching the area
for unsolved robberies.

230
00:08:51,706 --> 00:08:53,806
i found 4
with similar elements--

231
00:08:53,872 --> 00:08:56,480
phone lines cut,
small valuables only.

232
00:08:56,485 --> 00:08:57,739
occupants tied up?

233
00:08:57,806 --> 00:08:58,849
yes, but no homicides.

234
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,400
ok. thanks, dollface.
i'll call you back.

235
00:09:00,906 --> 00:09:01,900
well, if this is
our guys,

236
00:09:01,905 --> 00:09:03,675
something made them
graduate to murder.

237
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,539
if we can figure out
what that trigger was,

238
00:09:05,605 --> 00:09:07,273
it might tell us how they choose
their victims.

239
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:07,966
well, that would help.

240
00:09:08,472 --> 00:09:09,939
i be lookin'
into victimology,

241
00:09:10,006 --> 00:09:11,875
and so far,there's really nothing
to connect the families.

242
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:13,572
different political
affiliations,

243
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:15,006
different careers,

244
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,486
different
school systems.

245
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,872
at this point,
it simply appears

246
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:21,039
the unsubs are targeting
their victims at random.

247
00:09:21,605 --> 00:09:24,772
"a reunion is
in your future."

248
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:26,489
hey, what do you--what
do you think that means?

249
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,809
it doesn't mean nothin'.
it's a gimmick.

250
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,445
wi?

251
00:09:47,683 --> 00:09:48,506
ok.

252
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,009
it's your turn.

253
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,260
see anything you like?

254
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,950
we just don't think
it's a good idea.

255
00:09:55,239 --> 00:09:56,895
no, you haven't even
thought about it.

256
00:09:57,106 --> 00:09:59,505
you're just too young to spend a weekend with
some boys. that simple.

257
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,276
no, it's a whole group
of us, dad.

258
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,393
look, i've earned
some capital here.

259
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,545
i should be able
to spend it however i want.

260
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,946
who are you,
george bush?

261
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,266
don't laugh at me.

262
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,522
gosh, i do everything
you've ever wanted--

263
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:14,600
summer job,
student government.

264
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:16,000
drill team.
you like drill.

265
00:10:16,006 --> 00:10:18,500
are you kidding? i do it
to pad my rsum?

266
00:10:18,505 --> 00:10:20,826
to fulfill your dreams of getting me into
a good college.

267
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:22,805
oh, that's not fair,
carrie.

268
00:10:23,299 --> 00:10:26,160
you know, just because you two were losers
in high school

269
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,077
doesn't give you the right
to take it out on me.

270
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:30,599
<i>adnde vas?</i>

271
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:31,870
a lavar mis manos.

272
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:36,305
hey, you ever think
about goin' home?

273
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:37,399
no.

274
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,990
visit the folks?

275
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,450
might be time.

276
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:44,563
i--i don't wanna
ever go back there,

277
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,125
not ever.

278
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:47,905
i'm bored.

279
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,430
pick somebody,
or i'm takin' your turn.

280
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,665
reunion.

281
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,765
hey.

282
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,970
it just ran out
in front of my car.

283
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,000
is it yours?

284
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,990
god, what happened
to you?

285
00:12:31,734 --> 00:12:33,407
they killed us.

286
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,030
call 911!

287
00:12:38,701 --> 00:12:39,717
we're looking for 2 men,

288
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,257
probably white,
given the neighborhoods that they hit,

289
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,799
mid to late twenties,
intelligent, and organized.

290
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,820
these are
career criminals.

291
00:12:46,334 --> 00:12:48,000
one or both
has done hard time,

292
00:12:48,474 --> 00:12:50,000
but neither presents
as a convict.

293
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,057
they would
appear clean-shaven,

294
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:53,421
well dressed...

295
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:55,000
neighborly.
this helps them

296
00:12:55,005 --> 00:12:56,450
talk their way
into the homes.

297
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,900
they may also
be using a ruse.

298
00:12:57,901 --> 00:12:58,800
what kind of ruse?

299
00:12:58,805 --> 00:13:01,000
given that the invasions
have taken place in the evening,

300
00:13:01,001 --> 00:13:03,000
it could be anything.
could be door-to-door sales,

301
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,767
person in distress,
car trouble.

302
00:13:04,768 --> 00:13:07,933
uh, derrick todd lee
used a tape of a baby crying

303
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,733
to get women to open their doors
in baton rouge.

304
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,387
never underestimate
their creativity.

305
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,341
these men share
a very tight bond

306
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,917
and a mutual
compulsion to kill,

307
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,000
but their signatures reveal 2 very distinct
personalities.

308
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,441
one brutalizes
the parents.

309
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:23,604
this is the dominant one--
sadistic,

310
00:13:23,605 --> 00:13:25,307
remorseless,
extremely volatile.

311
00:13:25,374 --> 00:13:27,265
the other
prefers a needle.

312
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,900
his injections are consistent
with an angel of death.

313
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,616
he's more withdrawn,

314
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,450
sensitive, and he has
a warped sense of mercy.

315
00:13:34,453 --> 00:13:35,820
agent morgan
is passing out

316
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:37,585
a list of places where
he might have access

317
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,421
to the drug he uses.
it's long, but--

318
00:13:39,487 --> 00:13:41,553
hotch. there's been
another one,

319
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,840
and they're sending
an ambulance.

320
00:13:42,845 --> 00:13:44,680
ambulance?
there's a survivor?

321
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:46,867
she's lucky to be alive.

322
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,000
the injection went into the soft tissue
of the arm, missed the vein.

323
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:52,260
that's a first.
this guy doesn't miss.

324
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:53,720
like i said, she's lucky.

325
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:55,000
she conscious?

326
00:13:55,005 --> 00:13:56,853
she's in and out.
keep in mind

327
00:13:56,855 --> 00:13:58,984
she's suffering the effects of an acute
barbiturate overdose.

328
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,300
she's drowsy, confused.

329
00:14:01,303 --> 00:14:03,810
given what's happened,
that's probably best.

330
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,639
yeah, you can inform
the next of kin,

331
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,550
but ask them
to keep it close.

332
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:10,515
i don't want the media to know
there's a survivor.

333
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,130
kid's in his room
down the hall.

334
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:20,759
how old?

335
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,880
7.

336
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:25,993
you all right?

337
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,393
least they left the flowers
alive, right?

338
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,475
looks like the bodies
were moved postmortem.

339
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,580
the daughter had blood on her
when they found her?

340
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,050
she must have woken up,
come out here, and found them.

341
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,200
you answer your door,
and the next thing you know,

342
00:14:37,204 --> 00:14:39,000
everyone you
care about is gone.

343
00:14:42,593 --> 00:14:44,275
if it was me,
i'd wanna be gone, too.

344
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,060
i went to get a bag...

345
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:51,905
but when i got back,
there were 2 of them.

346
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,713
what did the other one
look like?

347
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:56,579
heavier...

348
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,936
hispanic...

349
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,336
quiet.

350
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,600
he never looked
straight ahead.

351
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,485
what do you mean?

352
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,709
like...

353
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,275
a few times,
i felt him staring at me.

354
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:14,391
when i looked up,
he always looked away.

355
00:15:14,395 --> 00:15:15,575
avoiding
eye contact?

356
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:21,050
then my dad came in
from the study, and...

357
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,985
they jumped him.

358
00:15:25,157 --> 00:15:26,685
they made danny
call for my mom,

359
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,825
and they tied them up.

360
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,118
and then one of 'em
went over,

361
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,151
got the thing
from the fireplace,

362
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,605
he started hitting them
with it.

363
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,255
and they made us watch.

364
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,147
ok, you know what?
we can take a break--

365
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,000
no.

366
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,095
you need this, right?

367
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,147
after a while,
the quiet one took danny away,

368
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:56,330
and the other one just started going through
drawers, looking for stuff.

369
00:15:58,891 --> 00:16:00,000
and i ran.

370
00:16:01,524 --> 00:16:03,535
danny. danny, we gotta go.

371
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,157
it's better
this way, lucy.

372
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,690
what did you do to him?
lucy, listen--

373
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:09,299
my name's not lucy,
you freak.

374
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,349
i could take care
of you now.

375
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:12,262
please, por favor,
dejame ir--

376
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:13,709
i don't know what
you're trying to say,

377
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,986
but you have to be quiet, ok?

378
00:16:16,162 --> 00:16:17,865
you're gonna
make my brother mad.

379
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,415
shh. let's go.

380
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,396
let's go.

381
00:16:20,463 --> 00:16:21,219
no!

382
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,002
shh. lucy, come on.

383
00:16:29,450 --> 00:16:30,585
hey, hotch!

384
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,055
they only take things
with monetary value, right,

385
00:16:39,062 --> 00:16:40,870
jewelry and cash,
no souvenirs?

386
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:42,048
far as we know.

387
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,462
one of them
just broke pattern.

388
00:16:59,196 --> 00:17:01,000
witness says these unsubs
are using cats.

389
00:17:01,002 --> 00:17:02,780
we should find out where
they might be getting them.

390
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,795
there's plenty
of strays out there.

391
00:17:03,862 --> 00:17:05,339
nobody would
notice if a few went missing.

392
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,800
or they could work someplace where they had
access to animals.

393
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:10,096
could overlap
with the pentobarbital--

394
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,000
research labs,
veterinary hospitals.

395
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:13,553
i'll get garcia
to make up a list.

396
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,977
carrie said that they referred to each other
as brothers.

397
00:17:16,354 --> 00:17:18,154
it's not uncommon
for duos to be related.

398
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,700
the hillside stranglers
were cousins.

399
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:21,959
the carr brothers perpetrated
the wichita massacre.

400
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,053
yeah, but these two are
of different races,

401
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:26,720
and carrie said the hispanic one
did not speak spanish,

402
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:28,000
which makes me think...

403
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,170
raised in a white household.
maybe they're half brothers.

404
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,092
what if they're adopted?
family destruction plays a role in the crimes.

405
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:35,255
it could be a reflection
of their own broken home.

406
00:17:35,491 --> 00:17:37,059
this guy expressed
affection for carrie.

407
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,458
we know he took
her photograph.

408
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,599
we could use that.

409
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,375
if we release news of her survival,
it might draw him out.

410
00:17:43,192 --> 00:17:44,111
not comfortable
with that?

411
00:17:44,558 --> 00:17:46,992
ok, but i would be
more comfortable

412
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:48,658
if we doubled
her security.

413
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:55,192
i know. i know.

414
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:58,225
you were probably
expecting some nice family

415
00:17:58,226 --> 00:17:59,725
to take you away
from all this,

416
00:17:59,726 --> 00:18:02,075
but that's a lie.

417
00:18:02,726 --> 00:18:04,039
they would have hurt you.

418
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,092
you're one
of the lucky ones, ok?

419
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,572
sleep.

420
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,400
sleep.

421
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,305
hey, ervin,
you got a visitor.

422
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:30,408
what did you do?

423
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,059
what do you mean,w-what did i do?
i didn't do anything.

424
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,425
that girl, she survived.
it's all over the news.

425
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,535
she did?

426
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,793
yeah. she's probably telling 'em everything
right now.

427
00:18:40,926 --> 00:18:43,185
hey, man, i--i thought
it was a good shot.

428
00:18:43,192 --> 00:18:45,526
and this has nothing to do with
your little crush.

429
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:46,959
hey, it's not a crush.
i-it--

430
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,126
it doesn't matter!

431
00:18:51,652 --> 00:18:52,526
maybe this is
a sign, gary.

432
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:54,526
m-maybe we should stop.
i mean...

433
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,792
i'm making good money here.

434
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,730
screw the money.

435
00:18:58,150 --> 00:18:59,496
but the kids, they--

436
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,960
the kids are better off.
you know that.

437
00:19:02,192 --> 00:19:03,993
don't go soft on me now.

438
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,825
we're all we got.
we're family.

439
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,800
we're family.

440
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,720
ok, great. thank you
for your time.

441
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,800
hey. so carrie's
been cleared to go.

442
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:18,785
well, i wish
she had somewhere to go.

443
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,475
no luck
with the l.a. thing?

444
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,720
can't this girl
catch a break?

445
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,290
it just ran
into the road.

446
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,860
is it yours?

447
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,716
carrie.
carrie. carrie.

448
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,400
wake up. wake up.
wake up.

449
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:54,800
it's ok.

450
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,850
oh, it was daddy.

451
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,089
it's ok.
it's just a dream.

452
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,650
ok. i'm ok.

453
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:02,985
ok?
yeah.

454
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,555
we, uh--we brought you
a change of clothes.

455
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,250
i--i didn't know
what to grab you,

456
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:11,370
so i just got
three of everything.

457
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,200
from the house.

458
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,486
looks like a flower shop
in here.

459
00:20:18,683 --> 00:20:20,125
yeah. they all
started, um...

460
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,730
coming in after
the news broadcast.

461
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:28,015
exact same floral arrangement was
in the ortiz living room.

462
00:20:28,217 --> 00:20:29,505
could be coincidence.

463
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,640
or the sender
was in the house,

464
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,786
associated it with her.

465
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,430
no note?

466
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,354
no, just a blank card
from the floral shop.

467
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,223
get garcia
to track the delivery,

468
00:20:37,225 --> 00:20:38,600
and reid's got something
for us when you're done.

469
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,223
hey, garcia. it's em.

470
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:43,490
why cats?
sorry?

471
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:45,776
evil has no boundaries.

472
00:20:45,783 --> 00:20:48,100
well, for what it's worth, i think
they go peacefully.

473
00:20:48,105 --> 00:20:49,700
yeah. how do i catch
these guys?

474
00:20:49,705 --> 00:20:52,865
uh, back-trace a flower delivery
for me.

475
00:20:53,239 --> 00:20:54,654
this is
the laybourne house,

476
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,090
where we believe our unsubs graduated
from robbery to murder.

477
00:20:57,272 --> 00:20:57,940
did you find a trigger?

478
00:20:58,339 --> 00:21:00,305
not until i looked at the daughter's
autopsy reports.

479
00:21:00,372 --> 00:21:02,640
uh, check out the bruises
on her torso.

480
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,296
she was beaten?

481
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,110
but not by our unsubs.

482
00:21:05,239 --> 00:21:08,025
the coroner noted those bruises were
several days old.

483
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,400
uh, it turns out she'd been to
the emergency room

484
00:21:10,405 --> 00:21:12,259
3 times
in less than 2 years.

485
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,757
the d.s.s. had even
been notified.

486
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,900
so the laybournes were abusing their daughter.
where's this going?

487
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:16,923
one of the unsubs

488
00:21:16,925 --> 00:21:18,455
decimates
parental figures,

489
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,300
but we know
the statistics there.

490
00:21:20,302 --> 00:21:22,903
it's--it's likely
he was abused himself.

491
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:25,545
so you're saying the unsub recognized
the signs of abuse,

492
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,700
flew into a rage,
and killed the parents?

493
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,200
anger displacement.
he's getting revenge for his own childhood abuse.

494
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:33,270
so you think what,
the victims were beating their kids?

495
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:35,038
uh, the laybourne case
was just the trigger,

496
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:36,675
but now they see
all parents the same.

497
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,288
that doesn't
explain the kids.

498
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,235
maybe it does. think of

499
00:21:39,238 --> 00:21:42,080
the family annihilators
john list and mark barton.

500
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,371
they thought they were
saving their kids by killin' 'em.

501
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,100
but what is
he savin' them from?

502
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:47,705
life without
their parents,

503
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,145
without love,
life like his.

504
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,714
they're orphans.
what if they both

505
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:52,247
grew up in
a third-party household?

506
00:21:52,314 --> 00:21:54,129
what, like a foster home?

507
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,114
didn't carrie describe
an aversion to eye contact?

508
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,481
oppositional
defiant disorder.

509
00:21:57,547 --> 00:21:59,147
often seen in kids
who grew up in foster homes.

510
00:21:59,214 --> 00:22:02,149
guys, i think we may have found our girl's
secret admirer.

511
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:03,174
garcia traced
the flowers?

512
00:22:03,175 --> 00:22:07,215
yep. paid for by phone
with a credit card???????????

513
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,100
detective.

514
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,150
flowers weren't
the only thing they bought

515
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:42,244
on that stolen credit card.
$31 worth of gas

516
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:43,675
at a station
3 blocks from here.

517
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,500
hey, paul. paul.
the station--

518
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:46,650
see if you can pull the security camera
footage,

519
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:47,630
i.d. that car.

520
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,000
security chain's
been broken.

521
00:22:49,004 --> 00:22:50,476
they couldn't lie
their way in this time.

522
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,200
media blew their m.o.

523
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,440
they're speeding up,
feel us getting close.

524
00:22:55,106 --> 00:22:56,100
this is close?

525
00:23:01,007 --> 00:23:01,957
talk to me, garcia.

526
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,754
so, felons
in the denver area

527
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:07,900
with foster background,
stress on assaults and burglaries.

528
00:23:07,905 --> 00:23:08,960
the phone book.
what'd you get?

529
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,587
foster system's a bit of a breeding ground,
go figure.

530
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,473
well, try crossing it with--

531
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:14,709
with offenders having workplace access
to small animals

532
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:15,500
and/or pentobarbital?

533
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:16,920
9.
how many names?

534
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,300
matching all 3 criteria.

535
00:23:18,305 --> 00:23:19,570
sending them now.

536
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,925
now we're close.

537
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:27,245
cameras at that gas station
grabbed a visual of the car.

538
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,450
oldsmobile, mid-eighties,
partial plate only.

539
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:30,725
anything on the driver?

540
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,490
it was fuzzy.

541
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,380
well, then i guess
it's gonna be up to her. t

542
00:23:34,911 --> 00:23:36,130
cbs
she up for it?

543
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,180
i don't know.

544
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,080
this one.

545
00:23:41,147 --> 00:23:42,314
are you sure?

546
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,035
ok, that's a ervin robles.

547
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,235
last known is 39 hill street.

548
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,167
that's downtown.

549
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,825
employed by
the let's go.ty pound.po

550
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,980
your parents would be
really proud of you.

551
00:23:57,481 --> 00:23:58,713
it's too late
to be a good daughter now.

552
00:23:58,714 --> 00:24:01,124
oh, that's not true.

553
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,610
i was horrible to them.

554
00:24:05,481 --> 00:24:06,567
and now they're gone.

555
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,494
why did they do it?

556
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,320
i mean, there has to be
a reason, right?

557
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,617
oh, you'll drive yourself
crazy trying to figure out the reason.

558
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,014
i go crazy every time
i close my eyes.

559
00:24:22,113 --> 00:24:24,347
it may have
something to do

560
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,505
with what happened to them
when they were younger.

561
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,180
like what, they were abused
or something?

562
00:24:30,347 --> 00:24:32,100
there's a good chance.

563
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,805
are there any happy families?

564
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:45,141
thank you.

565
00:24:47,857 --> 00:24:48,670
excuse me, sir.

566
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:50,719
i'm agent hotchner
with the fbi.

567
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,666
this is agent prentiss.

568
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:53,391
we're looking for
ervin robles.

569
00:24:53,395 --> 00:24:54,735
ervin's off
till the weekend.

570
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,605
do you have any idea
where we might find him?

571
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,467
you might want to try
his apartment.

572
00:24:58,724 --> 00:24:59,890
we've been there.
it's abandoned.

573
00:25:00,095 --> 00:25:01,348
where do you send
his checks?

574
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,360
he picks them up.
what's this about?

575
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,865
we'd just like
to talk to him.

576
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,900
who can we talk to
that actually knows him?

577
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,430
well, nobody, really.

578
00:25:08,747 --> 00:25:10,300
he comes in,
does his job, and leaves.

579
00:25:10,304 --> 00:25:12,063
real quiet.
efficient, though.

580
00:25:12,065 --> 00:25:12,600
doing what?

581
00:25:12,602 --> 00:25:13,480
well, actual title's

582
00:25:13,485 --> 00:25:14,650
animal care technician,

583
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:17,675
but, really, he's kind of
the on-site kevorkian.

584
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:21,170
we need you to call him.

585
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,629
supervisor left a message
for ervin to come in right away.

586
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,510
work emergency.

587
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,427
he also said a man
stopped by yesterday,

588
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,280
got into a heated
argument with ervin.

589
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:31,400
the description sounded
a lot like the one carrie gave.bu

590
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:33,020
the partner--did he say
what they were fighting about?

591
00:25:33,025 --> 00:25:33,820
he couldn't hear it.

592
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:34,829
we need a name
on this guy.

593
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:36,047
well, until we find ervin,

594
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:37,415
there's only one person
that can tell us that.

595
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:38,448
the foster mom.

596
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:40,390
my god. ervin?

597
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:43,549
well, i mean,
he had behavior problems.

598
00:25:43,616 --> 00:25:45,816
they all do.
but nothing we couldn't handle.

599
00:25:45,883 --> 00:25:48,250
and he hasn't been acting
alone, mrs. manwaring.

600
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,149
he's got a partner.

601
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,210
perhaps someone else
who grew up in your care.

602
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,466
tyler, the adults
are talking here.

603
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,260
i just want some milk.

604
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,324
can you open the fridge?

605
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:03,507
you know the rules.

606
00:26:06,550 --> 00:26:10,076
huh! they'll eat you out of house and home
if you let them.

607
00:26:10,562 --> 00:26:12,536
is there anyone ervin
was especially close to?

608
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:14,400
someone he would have
looked up to?

609
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:15,623
somebody who protected him?

610
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,445
gary.

611
00:26:24,729 --> 00:26:25,866
we tried with him, but...

612
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,253
he tested us.

613
00:26:27,255 --> 00:26:28,445
have you kept in touch
with him?

614
00:26:28,450 --> 00:26:29,475
oh, god, no.

615
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:31,216
gary left the day
he turned 18,

616
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:31,909
never looked back.

617
00:26:32,815 --> 00:26:33,573
ervin was a mess
when he got here.

618
00:26:35,449 --> 00:26:37,148
got separated
from a younger sister.

619
00:26:37,149 --> 00:26:38,725
where did she go?

620
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:40,082
nobody told me.

621
00:26:40,349 --> 00:26:42,015
siblings get separated
all the time.

622
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,370
but they find
new ones here.

623
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,993
like ervin
found gary?

624
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,354
what was the name
of his sister,

625
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:49,653
the one he was
separated from?

626
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,220
oh, let me think. uh...

627
00:26:51,287 --> 00:26:53,220
he used to call her name out
in the middle of the night,

628
00:26:53,287 --> 00:26:54,386
wake the whole house up.

629
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,006
hal, what was that girl's name?

630
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,393
rosie, i think.

631
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,553
lucy?

632
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:01,885
yes! lucy, lucy,
that was it.

633
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,500
carrie said
he called her lucy.

634
00:27:03,504 --> 00:27:04,480
hotchner.

635
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,050
yeah, just leaving.

636
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,783
ervin returned the call.
he's on his way to work.

637
00:27:08,784 --> 00:27:09,730
thanks.
thank you.

638
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,900
subject spotted
approaching on foot

639
00:27:15,901 --> 00:27:17,095
from north alley.

640
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,834
ervin robles, right there!

641
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,070
get your ass down
on the ground right now!

642
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,075
ervin!

643
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,790
where you goin', ervin, huh?
why are you running?

644
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,466
give me your hand.

645
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,300
let's go.

646
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,130
you're not helping yourself
if you don't talk to me.

647
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:55,865
he's giving me nothing.

648
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:58,300
do you want another
crack at him?

649
00:27:58,305 --> 00:27:59,869
no. we can't keep
going around like this.

650
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,800
so let him stew.
wear him down.

651
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,150
we don't have time.

652
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,225
we need him to find gary.

653
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,650
kids who grew up
like he did,

654
00:28:06,655 --> 00:28:08,216
they're incapable
of forming attachments.

655
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,755
it's not like we're gonna
earn his trust.

656
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,587
their whole m.o.
was predicated

657
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:13,253
on the union of their
two personalities,

658
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,500
and with ervin
out of the picture,

659
00:28:14,505 --> 00:28:15,844
there's no telling
what gary could do.

660
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,270
so he won't talk to us.

661
00:28:18,687 --> 00:28:20,205
but maybe he'll talk
to family.

662
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:21,853
right this way.

663
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,620
remember, he'll be in, uh,
handcuffs, leg irons.

664
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:25,999
there'll be nothing
to worry about.

665
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,555
and i will be in there
with you.

666
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,924
ok.

667
00:28:29,851 --> 00:28:32,270
you don't have to do this
if you don't want to, carrie.

668
00:28:33,184 --> 00:28:34,048
i do.

669
00:28:34,284 --> 00:28:35,400
remember,
we're interested in gary.

670
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:37,411
his whereabouts,
his next move.

671
00:28:37,668 --> 00:28:39,610
i will keep him on point
about that, carrie.

672
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:42,285
just try your best
to keep him engaged.

673
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:43,635
this way.

674
00:28:44,718 --> 00:28:45,651
ok, i'm--i'm sorry.

675
00:28:45,655 --> 00:28:47,888
can--can we just stop and think about this
for a minute?

676
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:49,199
she'll be ok.

677
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,523
she's a kid.

678
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,280
what is she trying
to prove here?

679
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:54,849
that she can be
a good daughter.

680
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:02,936
hey. you're here.

681
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,200
did you, uh,

682
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,683
did you get the flowers
that i sent?

683
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:11,822
yeah.

684
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:14,800
pretty.

685
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,938
they were to say
that, uh...

686
00:29:16,939 --> 00:29:18,556
that i'm sorry.

687
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,840
flowers aren't enough,
ervin.

688
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,590
we need gary.

689
00:29:27,006 --> 00:29:28,536
that won't make it up,
though.

690
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,906
it's a start.

691
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,829
no!

692
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:33,136
they're gonna
send you away now.

693
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,900
don't you see?
that's what they dov with all the strays.

694
00:29:35,903 --> 00:29:36,875
they send them away.

695
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,850
that's why i make them
go to sleep,

696
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:44,020
so that they
don't have to suffer.

697
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,925
ervin, more people are going to suffer
if we can't find gary.

698
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,660
so when you killed
my brother,

699
00:29:50,337 --> 00:29:51,549
you were doing him
a favor?

700
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,300
and what about me?
it's true.

701
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:55,337
let's just address
one thing at a time.

702
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,957
i just wanted
to see you again.

703
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,210
you look so much
like lucy, i just...

704
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:02,567
i couldn't--i--

705
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,133
i know--i know
it's selfish, but--

706
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,567
selfish? it's insane.

707
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:07,934
ok, carrie,
let's take a break.

708
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:10,187
what happened to you
that was so bad?

709
00:30:15,834 --> 00:30:18,870
she used to make it...
go dark.

710
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:22,650
i mean, that's what we used to call it.
she would...

711
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,707
put me in the bath
to pray.

712
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,630
and then she'd
hold my head downow

713
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,110
under the water.

714
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,530
sometimes i could
stay awake...

715
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,526
for like a minute...

716
00:30:42,763 --> 00:30:43,870
and sometimes
a little more.

717
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,806
then it would
all go dark.

718
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,163
they've still got kids
in that house.

719
00:30:50,165 --> 00:30:51,800
another kid,
another welfare check.

720
00:30:51,801 --> 00:30:53,960
let's call d.s.s. and see
if we can get them out of there.

721
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,350
what is she doing?

722
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,349
they can't hurt you
anymore, ervin.

723
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,890
i wanted to stop,

724
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,053
but gary, he...

725
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,934
he went through it way, way worse
when we were kids,

726
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,860
and he...he never got the chance
to fight back.

727
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:16,953
so he fought
those other families.

728
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,125
only because
i wouldn't go back.

729
00:31:22,667 --> 00:31:23,430
back?

730
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,140
gary's going
to your foster home,

731
00:31:27,366 --> 00:31:28,367
isn't he?

732
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,585
get him out of there.

733
00:31:43,433 --> 00:31:44,533
carrie.

734
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,350
oh, you did so good.

735
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,100
what is all this?

736
00:31:58,101 --> 00:32:00,785
we have reason to believe that gary may be on his way
here to hurt you.

737
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,133
me? i don't
understand!

738
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,267
these murder are rehearsals
of what he wants to do to you.

739
00:32:04,334 --> 00:32:06,140
'cause of what you did
to him in this house.

740
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,300
i don't know what
you're talking about!

741
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:08,757
ma'am, we don't have
time to debate this.

742
00:32:08,764 --> 00:32:10,800
the fact is,
you and your husband are in danger.

743
00:32:11,067 --> 00:32:13,239
i--i have to pick up
the children at school.

744
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,367
we'll send someone
to pick them up.

745
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,545
the only way we can protect you is if
yogo back inside.

746
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,067
hey, buddy.

747
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,614
you don't remember me?

748
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,833
i used to live in your house,
a long time ago.

749
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,800
you were jt a little guy.

750
00:32:47,803 --> 00:32:49,433
we're not supposed
to talk to strangers

751
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,500
you're not supposed to wear your shoes
in the house,

752
00:32:51,506 --> 00:32:53,833
not supposed to go to the bathroom
after bedtime.

753
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,034
does she still wear the refrigerator key
around her neck?

754
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,025
i'm gary. i'll give
you guys a ride.

755
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,467
come on.

756
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,700
witnesses saw the kids
getting into

757
00:33:24,705 --> 00:33:26,471
a late eighties oldsmobile about
20 minutes ago.

758
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:29,049
i heard. denver p.d.
set up a 20 mile perimeter.

759
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,739
what does he want
with the kids?

760
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,305
with ervin out of the way,
maybe gary's trying to do his job.

761
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:35,022
he makes them sleep.

762
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:37,725
reid, what?

763
00:33:37,872 --> 00:33:40,572
we got him.
he's at a donut shop 2 miles from the school.

764
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:42,306
black and whites saw the car,
called it in.

765
00:33:42,373 --> 00:33:43,020
kids?

766
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,472
ah, we got a visual
on gary and the boy,

767
00:33:46,479 --> 00:33:47,850
but i don't see
the girl.

768
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,395
are you the police?
yeah.

769
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,445
he told me
to give this to you.

770
00:33:58,555 --> 00:34:00,039
we might have
a problem, hotch.

771
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,040
guys, guys, fall back,i don't want them
feeling boxed in.

772
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,826
i got sharpshooters
lining up.

773
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,005
tell them to keep
their safeties on.

774
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,200
i want to talk to him first.

775
00:34:19,642 --> 00:34:20,616
hotch?
yeah?

776
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:21,829
got the clerk.

777
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,642
that guy sitting at the table
with the little bo

778
00:34:25,709 --> 00:34:26,760
i'd like to speak
to him, please.

779
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,972
you, uh, got a call
over here, man.

780
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,305
grab your stuff.
come on.

781
00:34:42,543 --> 00:34:43,400
who's this?

782
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:45,495
i'm the only thing standing between
you and a bullet.

783
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:52,220
bring it. i always wanted
to die in a donut shop.

784
00:34:52,576 --> 00:34:54,389
and never see
ervin again?

785
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,175
he told us what the manwarings did
to you in that house.

786
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:00,343
i n't care what he told you,
it's history.

787
00:35:00,345 --> 00:35:02,009
they're the objects
of your anger, gary,

788
00:35:02,076 --> 00:35:03,125
not that little boy
in there.

789
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:05,079
it's too late
for the boy, regardless.

790
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,910
noit's not.
it's not, gary.

791
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,006
and deep down,
i think you know

792
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,452
that he still
has a chance.

793
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,685
he doesn't have
to be you.

794
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,115
maybe.

795
00:35:18,009 --> 00:35:19,000
maybe not.

796
00:35:20,543 --> 00:35:22,043
so what say we leave it
up to him.

797
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:25,310
what is it?
what'd he say?

798
00:35:31,443 --> 00:35:32,600
tyler!

799
00:35:32,602 --> 00:35:33,723
come here!
come on.

800
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,160
gary, put your hands up where i can see them.
don't move!

801
00:35:57,409 --> 00:35:58,479
get down on your knees.

802
00:35:59,176 --> 00:36:00,622
interlace your fingers
behind your head.

803
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:09,260
give me this hand.

804
00:36:10,249 --> 00:36:11,883
give me this hand.

805
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:14,500
get on your feet.

806
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,480
i don't know what you did,
but nice work.

807
00:36:32,453 --> 00:36:33,356
thanks.

808
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,290
yeah,i understand that,
i'm just...

809
00:36:36,717 --> 00:36:39,387
i'm asking if there's
some type of alternative for them.

810
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,650
nothing?

811
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,550
yes, i got it.

812
00:36:45,555 --> 00:36:46,785
don't ask me to like it.

813
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,349
well, what? what is it?

814
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,833
social services
won't intervene

815
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:51,550
until they do
a full investigation.

816
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:53,070
we have to take them home?

817
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,470
yeah.

818
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:04,690
hang on a second.

819
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,495
i teach crisis negotiation.

820
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,801
i co-wrote the textbook,

821
00:37:13,867 --> 00:37:16,700
and in 12 years,
i've never talked anybody off a ledge so fast.

822
00:37:16,701 --> 00:37:19,430
oh, bit of
a milestone, huh?

823
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,520
why'd you walk out
that door, gary?

824
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,020
sugar crash.

825
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,000
tyler...

826
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:39,925
i need to talk
to you for a second.

827
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,900
kid, listen to me.

828
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,160
anything
you ever need,

829
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,024
any problem
you might be having  here at home,

830
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,787
i want you to know
you can call me.

831
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,260
any time, tyler.

832
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:56,345
you understand?

833
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,975
any time.

834
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,570
this sucks.

835
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,000
so meet at 4:30
on the stairs,

836
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:27,100
and you can direct
all your questions

837
00:38:27,101 --> 00:38:29,399
to lieutenant nellis of the denver p.d.,
all right?

838
00:38:29,466 --> 00:38:30,349
they'll be taking
everything.

839
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,165
what happened next?

840
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,900
you're welcome.

841
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,800
i didn't know
anything was up

842
00:38:35,801 --> 00:38:38,035
until he, uh, came
and got the phone.

843
00:38:38,367 --> 00:38:39,750
that's when
i saw the piece.

844
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,516
then i handed him
the phone.

845
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,580
excuse me,
did you say piece?

846
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:47,300
uh, yeah, revolver
of some sort.

847
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,599
he had it stuck
in his pants.

848
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,233
diyou clear a gun?
no.

849
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,296
yeah, reid?

850
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,433
hotch, the clerk
said gary had a gun,

851
00:38:58,435 --> 00:39:00,650
but we didn't
recover anything here.

852
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,300
you sure?
yeah.

853
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:05,075
i saw nellis turn him inside out.
he had nothing on him.

854
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,669
i guess it's probably
here somewhere.

855
00:39:06,736 --> 00:39:09,290
a gun doesn't just
walk away.

856
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:13,766
hotch?

857
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,000
yeah, hotch?

858
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,615
we just dropped
them off. we're leavin'.

859
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,305
the backpacks?
no, why? why would we search the back--

860
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,550
tyler!

861
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,050
drop that gun.

862
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,775
are you hurt?
no.

863
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,165
tyler...

864
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,060
come on, kid,
take it easy.

865
00:40:03,850 --> 00:40:05,020
they're lies.

866
00:40:06,034 --> 00:40:07,040
i know.

867
00:40:07,934 --> 00:40:09,200
but you could have
come in here,

868
00:40:09,205 --> 00:40:10,370
and you could have
made her pay,

869
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:12,455
and you didn't,
because you're good.

870
00:40:14,266 --> 00:40:15,460
you're not gary.

871
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:17,235
no.

872
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,627
you're nothing like him.

873
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,025
look at me.

874
00:40:24,633 --> 00:40:25,493
