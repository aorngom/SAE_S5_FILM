1
00:00:23,647 --> 00:00:28,767
Oh, God. Three months on this rock,
and I still can't get a decent cup of coffee.

2
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:31,407
Core sample analysis coming in,
but so far,

3
00:00:31,487 --> 00:00:35,366
the highest concentration
is 2.3 parts per million.

4
00:00:35,447 --> 00:00:37,438
2.3 parts.

5
00:00:37,527 --> 00:00:42,043
Major Lorne, we need enough
naqahdah to manufacture 303s.

6
00:00:42,127 --> 00:00:45,278
- You know how big a battle cruiser is?
- It's pretty big, sir.

7
00:00:45,367 --> 00:00:48,962
If we start mining these deposits
right now, today,

8
00:00:49,047 --> 00:00:54,917
your great-grandchildren're still gonna be
trying to pull out enough ore to make one.

9
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:57,362
Colonel Edwards?

10
00:00:57,447 --> 00:01:00,962
- Menard.
- Latest analysis shows a concentration

11
00:01:01,047 --> 00:01:05,996
50 times higher than anything we've seen
so far. It's increasing as we go deeper.

12
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:08,521
This could be the one, sir.

13
00:01:09,327 --> 00:01:15,402
Yeah. If this pans out, your
great-grandchildren might be off the hook.

14
00:01:15,487 --> 00:01:17,682
Yes, sir.

15
00:03:12,047 --> 00:03:14,038
Colonel Edwards?

16
00:03:16,047 --> 00:03:21,201
I'm glad you're here, Jack. Ritter's
been missing now for three hours.

17
00:03:21,287 --> 00:03:25,917
- I assume he has a compass and a radio.
- The planet has strange magnetic traits,

18
00:03:26,007 --> 00:03:29,841
which make a compass useless
and limit the range of our radios.

19
00:03:29,927 --> 00:03:35,126
We need him back, now that we may have
found a significant deposit of naqahdah.

20
00:03:35,207 --> 00:03:39,246
- How significant?
- We won't know until after our analysis.

21
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:42,922
The Pentagon wants battle cruisers
and F-302s. We find the rocks.

22
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:47,956
- And we find the rock... finders.
- There you have it.

23
00:03:48,047 --> 00:03:51,005
Major Lorne will show you
where Ritter was last seen.

24
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:53,078
If you'll follow me.

25
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,683
What's this?

26
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:05,080
- Artefacts?
- Yes.

27
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:09,797
- You found all this and didn't contact me?
- We were going to.

28
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:13,357
- They've been moved.
- Well, they were in the way.

29
00:04:13,807 --> 00:04:15,399
Daniel.

30
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:18,795
Go to your happy place.

31
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,677
Go.

32
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:33,118
Lieutenant Ritter was mapping
the surrounding area.

33
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:37,723
When he didn't show up for chow, we got
worried and went out looking for him, sir.

34
00:04:37,807 --> 00:04:40,958
Sent up flares, hoped he'd see 'em,
get his bearings.

35
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:45,325
Is it normal for guys
to wander away from camp?

36
00:04:45,407 --> 00:04:50,686
He might have been placing markers.
Multiple sightings, you get turned around.

37
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:54,678
- Teal'c?
- The ground is extremely firm, O'Neill.

38
00:04:54,767 --> 00:04:57,042
- No tracks?
- Not in the immediate area.

39
00:04:57,127 --> 00:05:01,678
But there is damage to the underbrush
moving off in several different directions.

40
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,723
Jack, come in.

41
00:05:03,807 --> 00:05:05,559
Yeah. Go ahead.

42
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,516
I'm not reading you. Say again.

43
00:05:11,607 --> 00:05:15,202
I said I've got something here
you need to see.

44
00:05:15,287 --> 00:05:17,084
All right, on my way.

45
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,601
You guys keep looking. I'll be back.

46
00:05:26,127 --> 00:05:28,595
- What you got?
- Mostly mining equipment.

47
00:05:28,687 --> 00:05:33,283
Could be several hundred years old.
Hard to date it till I get it back to the SGC.

48
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:36,439
- Remember these?
- Ever so fondly.

49
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:42,519
- Still has power.
- Just keeps going and going.

50
00:05:42,607 --> 00:05:45,679
I want to show you
the truly fascinating part.

51
00:05:45,767 --> 00:05:51,478
It's a yoke, capable of pulling great
weight. It predates the harness on Earth.

52
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,604
- Fascinating. Truly.
- I was getting to that part.

53
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:57,076
It's too big, too heavy.

54
00:05:57,167 --> 00:06:00,284
- Meaning?
- It wasn't made for a human being.

55
00:06:00,367 --> 00:06:03,439
- Who was it made for?
- It's too small for an animal.

56
00:06:03,527 --> 00:06:07,440
Based on what I know about the Goa'uld,
I'd say it was made for an Unas.

57
00:06:07,527 --> 00:06:10,246
The Goa'uld used the Unas
as slaves before humans.

58
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:14,240
They're predominantly cave dwellers
and can work in harsh environments -

59
00:06:14,327 --> 00:06:19,321
- perfect labour for this kind of mining.
- This day just gets better and better.

60
00:06:19,407 --> 00:06:20,806
Teal'c, come in.

61
00:06:22,647 --> 00:06:24,046
Proceed, O'Neill.

62
00:06:24,127 --> 00:06:26,322
- Find anything?
- We have not.

63
00:06:26,407 --> 00:06:30,844
Heads up. Daniel just found evidence
an Unas might have been in the area.

64
00:06:34,447 --> 00:06:36,438
Acknowledged.

65
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:45,237
You want me to delay this operation
because you found a shoulder harness...

66
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:48,319
- Yoke, actually.
...that could be built for a creature

67
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,717
that probably disappeared
or died off a long time ago?

68
00:06:51,807 --> 00:06:55,322
The Goa'uld left slaves behind
once they lost interest in a planet.

69
00:06:55,407 --> 00:06:59,116
In three months we haven't seen
anything like what you describe.

70
00:06:59,207 --> 00:07:04,406
- Maybe that's the way they want it.
- Doctor, the Pentagon wants results.

71
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:08,844
You don't understand. Unas are territorial,
and when provoked can be dangerous.

72
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:12,158
- Is he always like this?
- Yeah, pretty much.

73
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:16,320
If they are here, do you think they had
anything to do with Ritter gone missing?

74
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:18,523
Yes, I do.

75
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:20,996
I'm not closing down this operation,

76
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:27,037
but I do think we should bring in
some extra troops, help secure the area.

77
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:43,559
What is it?

78
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:49,643
The Unas wear these to prevent the
Goa'uld from burrowing into their necks.

79
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:09,366
I believe these figures
are intended as a warning to stay away.

80
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,158
Lieutenant Ritter.

81
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:52,762
All right! I want extra ammo for everyone.

82
00:08:52,847 --> 00:08:56,283
Keep your eyes open
and stay in radio contact.

83
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:58,961
What are you intending to do?

84
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:03,920
These things killed one of my men
and strung him up like a scarecrow.

85
00:09:04,007 --> 00:09:08,046
- What the hell do you think I intend to do?
- You may have provoked them.

86
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:13,121
We didn't even know they were here. How
the hell could we have provoked them?

87
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:17,917
If the mine extends as far as you estimate,
then this other entrance is in the network.

88
00:09:18,007 --> 00:09:20,760
It's an alternate entrance
to the same mine.

89
00:09:20,847 --> 00:09:24,283
It has to be something
about this area, this mine.

90
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:28,406
- They don't want us here.
- The feeling's mutual.

91
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:30,637
Jack?

92
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:32,240
Look,

93
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:35,603
I know he can be a little...

94
00:09:35,687 --> 00:09:38,155
but he's usually right about this stuff.

95
00:09:38,247 --> 00:09:42,604
My orders are to determine the potential
of this site as a mining operation.

96
00:09:42,687 --> 00:09:47,124
Until those orders are rescinded,
I will ensure the safety of my people.

97
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:51,439
So, are you gonna help me
secure this area or not?

98
00:10:00,327 --> 00:10:03,319
- This is a mistake.
- It's his command, Daniel.

99
00:10:03,407 --> 00:10:07,116
He's never encountered the Unas.
He doesn't know what he's dealing with.

100
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,206
Argh!

101
00:10:33,247 --> 00:10:34,760
Aaagh!

102
00:10:54,607 --> 00:10:56,723
Ka Keka!

103
00:10:56,807 --> 00:10:59,082
Ka Keka!

104
00:11:00,687 --> 00:11:03,076
Ska nat?

105
00:11:03,167 --> 00:11:05,123
Ka Ko Keka?

106
00:11:09,287 --> 00:11:10,845
Benna!

107
00:11:10,927 --> 00:11:12,758
Benna Ka Cha!

108
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:17,595
Benna Ka Cha!

109
00:11:28,727 --> 00:11:30,718
Help him. Help him.

110
00:11:37,887 --> 00:11:42,165
My men'll take care of the wounded.
They're on the run. Let's take 'em now.

111
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:48,956
- What's that? What are they doing now?
- They're mourning their dead.

112
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:52,801
This may be our best chance.
We're not gonna let 'em get away, are we?

113
00:11:52,887 --> 00:11:55,526
We won't pursue an enemy
into unknown terrain.

114
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:57,882
You think they're capable of tactics?

115
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,357
We know them. They're
far more intelligent than you think.

116
00:12:01,447 --> 00:12:04,120
I don't care. They attacked us.

117
00:12:04,207 --> 00:12:06,243
Edwards, we're not going in!

118
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:09,922
This is my command.
You are here at my request.

119
00:12:10,007 --> 00:12:14,285
- You're in charge of a mining operation.
- Your standing orders no longer apply.

120
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:18,042
Let's take it back to SGC
and we'll figure it out there.

121
00:12:18,127 --> 00:12:19,924
Fine.

122
00:12:28,487 --> 00:12:29,966
Ow! God!

123
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:32,436
Get away.

124
00:12:36,727 --> 00:12:40,037
- How's the arm?
- Good.

125
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:42,880
How's the science project?

126
00:12:42,967 --> 00:12:45,959
You mean my overhaul
of the gate diagnostic system?

127
00:12:46,047 --> 00:12:49,881
- I guess that's what I mean.
- It's going well, sir. Thank you for asking.

128
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:55,485
If we go back to this planet,
you're not coming with us, are you?

129
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:58,877
- It's doubtful.
- Yeah, that's too bad.

130
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:02,277
I was hoping
you'd take command of the mission.

131
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:05,120
Colonel Edwards
has no experience with the Unas.

132
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:07,198
Nor you.

133
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:12,244
He's an OK guy, Daniel.
He's just under a lot of pressure.

134
00:13:12,807 --> 00:13:16,516
Yeah. Yeah. I guess I just spent
a lot of time breaking you in.

135
00:13:16,607 --> 00:13:20,361
I just didn't want to
have to start with a new colonel.

136
00:13:20,447 --> 00:13:22,915
It'll be fine.

137
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:29,363
Just try not to be so...

138
00:13:31,407 --> 00:13:34,558
- What?
- Oh, you know.

139
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:46,920
Colonel, General Vidrine
is down from the Pentagon.

140
00:13:47,007 --> 00:13:50,317
He's been put in charge of
BC-303 production.

141
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:54,878
We've read your report, Colonel, and we
agree that the evacuation was warranted.

142
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:58,642
Unfortunately, with the Prometheus
stranded across the galaxy,

143
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:02,083
Earth is currently vulnerable
to orbital attack.

144
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:06,877
If someone can show me another way
to acquire naqahdah, I'm listening.

145
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:10,039
Otherwise, we've got to
go back to P3X-403.

146
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:13,961
With enough men and firepower,
I can take care of your problem, sir.

147
00:14:14,047 --> 00:14:17,437
We've dealt with these creatures before,

148
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:20,963
and I can guarantee you
it won't be as easy as you think.

149
00:14:21,047 --> 00:14:24,960
Be that as it may, the Pentagon's
position is quite clear on this.

150
00:14:25,047 --> 00:14:28,881
Colonel Edwards will return to the planet
and begin mining operations.

151
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:32,437
SG personnel will provide security
on a continuing basis.

152
00:14:32,527 --> 00:14:35,166
- If this leads to hostilities...
- It will.

153
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:41,162
Dr Jackson, I don't believe
you were invited to this meeting.

154
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:45,763
Yes, General, I know.
I'm sorry, but please hear me out.

155
00:14:45,847 --> 00:14:49,283
- The situation can be resolved peacefully.
- How?

156
00:14:49,367 --> 00:14:51,676
We've been on this planet a long time.

157
00:14:51,767 --> 00:14:55,965
It wasn't until we encroached on
this one region that the Unas attacked.

158
00:14:56,047 --> 00:14:58,845
Can't we just mine
away from this one area?

159
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:03,079
All the other mine sites we've surveyed
have been void of significant deposits.

160
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,718
This is the only site we've found thus far
that might satisfy production quotas.

161
00:15:07,807 --> 00:15:11,322
- And if this leads to another dead end?
- Then we won't have a problem,

162
00:15:11,407 --> 00:15:14,877
but I'm not going to walk away from this
until I know for sure.

163
00:15:14,967 --> 00:15:18,482
Then can we at least
try to negotiate with them?

164
00:15:18,567 --> 00:15:21,957
- They're animals, sir.
- They are not. They are intelligent.

165
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:24,322
If you underestimate them, more will die.

166
00:15:24,407 --> 00:15:27,126
Who would negotiate on our behalf? You?

167
00:15:27,207 --> 00:15:31,246
I have a limited vocabulary and a
rudimentary understanding of their ways,

168
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,444
but this has gone too far
for me to handle myself.

169
00:15:34,527 --> 00:15:38,839
- What are you proposing, Doctor?
- I suggest we use Chaka as a liaison.

170
00:15:38,927 --> 00:15:41,725
- Chaka?
- An Unas we met on a different planet.

171
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:46,562
I've had contact with him. He's made
progress in his understanding of us.

172
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:50,481
We've interacted with these beings before
and lived. Chaka saved my life.

173
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:55,436
This is their planet. We're the invaders.
We don't have to provoke or kill them.

174
00:15:55,527 --> 00:15:59,406
- I'm sure no one wants that, Dr Jackson.
- Yes, I'm sure.

175
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:03,685
If talks are resolved in the time allotted
to determine the viability of the mine,

176
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:06,600
you're giving up nothing by letting him try.

177
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:10,405
All right. Proceed.

178
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:15,436
Dr Jackson, you'll contact Chaka
and return him here without delay.

179
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:18,599
One more thing,
so that there's no confusion.

180
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,317
If negotiations fail
and it comes down to us or them,

181
00:16:23,407 --> 00:16:25,398
I choose us.

182
00:16:26,287 --> 00:16:29,484
The use of deadly force is authorised.

183
00:16:39,527 --> 00:16:42,803
IDC received, sir.
Dr Jackson, plus one.

184
00:16:42,887 --> 00:16:45,003
Open the iris.

185
00:16:57,207 --> 00:16:59,402
Stand down.

186
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:04,446
Chaka's never been in
a structure like this before.

187
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:14,958
Um...

188
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:19,406
A Cha' Aka.

189
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:24,365
"A Cha' Aka" is a greeting.
In this case, he's saying hello.

190
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:28,116
'Ell... o.

191
00:17:28,767 --> 00:17:30,166
Pfft.

192
00:17:32,247 --> 00:17:34,044
Pfft.

193
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,436
Um, I've had a chance to talk with Chaka.

194
00:17:36,527 --> 00:17:39,360
He's managed to accomplish
some remarkable things.

195
00:17:39,447 --> 00:17:43,679
On the planet where Chaka lives humans
used Unas as domesticated slaves,

196
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:47,806
- but Chaka led an uprising, and...
- You neglected to mention this before.

197
00:17:47,887 --> 00:17:50,162
How many were killed in this uprising?

198
00:17:50,247 --> 00:17:54,798
That's not the point. Chaka brokered
a truce and established a fragile peace

199
00:17:54,887 --> 00:17:57,924
between the humans and Unas
who were formerly their slaves.

200
00:17:58,007 --> 00:17:59,804
If he managed to do this,

201
00:17:59,887 --> 00:18:03,641
I know he could act as a peaceful liaison
between us and the Unas of P3X-403.

202
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:08,198
- Does he even want to help us?
- I've informed him of what we need to do.

203
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:11,040
He's eager to meet Unas of other worlds.

204
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:13,118
Tar Ma Kan Ko?

205
00:18:20,687 --> 00:18:24,157
'Uman 'elp Chaka.

206
00:18:25,447 --> 00:18:29,326
Chaka 'elp 'uman.

207
00:18:32,607 --> 00:18:35,917
Looks like the Unas had a party
while we were gone.

208
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:38,123
You're right, Dr Jackson.

209
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,756
They're much more advanced
than what I thought.

210
00:18:41,847 --> 00:18:44,645
They have command of fire.

211
00:18:44,727 --> 00:18:48,322
Major Lorne,
as soon as this place is cleaned up,

212
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:54,198
I want you to begin a resonance scan
analysis of the lower mine shafts.

213
00:18:55,447 --> 00:18:58,280
How do you intend
to find these Unas, Doctor?

214
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:01,439
I think Chaka will lead us to them.

215
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:14,398
Chaka.

216
00:19:18,287 --> 00:19:20,847
Colonel, he knows you don't like him.

217
00:19:20,927 --> 00:19:25,318
Keep staring at him like that,
he's gonna take it as a challenge.

218
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,644
Chaka, Ka Kreeka.

219
00:19:38,087 --> 00:19:40,840
Just keep him away from me.

220
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:46,806
Hanson, Penhall, you're with them.

221
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:49,685
The rest of you,
I want this perimeter secured.

222
00:19:49,767 --> 00:19:53,680
Antipersonnel and
overlapping fields of fire. Move it!

223
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:58,124
- He's getting ready for a war.
- He's responsible for protecting his camp.

224
00:19:58,207 --> 00:20:01,802
Yeah, or he's looking for revenge
for Lieutenant Ritter.

225
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:26,676
'Uman tatack?

226
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:29,442
Ka. No. We're not gonna attack.

227
00:20:29,527 --> 00:20:31,040
Tonok. Shesh.

228
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:33,357
'Uman tatack.

229
00:20:33,447 --> 00:20:36,405
He says our weapons
and the size of our group create fear.

230
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:39,001
It seems like we intend to attack.

231
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:43,126
Ka. Dan'el, Chaka Ka cha.

232
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:46,358
- He wants me to go with him alone.
- Ka. Keka.

233
00:20:46,447 --> 00:20:48,278
Unarmed.

234
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:51,245
- You will be helpless.
- I'll be all right.

235
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,637
- This is unwise.
- We can't make contact if they fear us.

236
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:57,321
Are you certain?

237
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:01,603
Yeah. Yeah, I'm... I'm certain.

238
00:21:34,887 --> 00:21:40,678
Staff weapons, torture sticks, manacles -
symbols of pain and death.

239
00:21:43,247 --> 00:21:47,035
Chaka? Here, got a new toy.

240
00:21:53,047 --> 00:21:55,038
- Aka.
- You're welcome.

241
00:21:57,287 --> 00:22:01,565
A Cha' Aka, A Cha' Aka.

242
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,683
A Cha' Aka...

243
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:06,964
"Come sit by my fire" - Unas diplomacy.

244
00:22:07,927 --> 00:22:11,681
A Cha' Aka, A Cha' Aka.

245
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:15,885
A Cha' Aka, A Cha' Aka...

246
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,958
Chaka?

247
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:20,318
How long is this, um...

248
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:24,560
Kel Nok. Ma Kan Ska nat?

249
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:26,922
- Nok.
- Now.

250
00:22:27,407 --> 00:22:29,796
- Ka Nok.
- Later.

251
00:22:31,927 --> 00:22:34,157
A Cha' Aka, A Cha' Aka...

252
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:37,045
It will take as long as it takes.

253
00:22:45,207 --> 00:22:48,005
A Cha' Aka, A Cha' Aka...

254
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:09,038
Hello.

255
00:23:31,687 --> 00:23:34,520
I hope you know what you're doing.

256
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:39,436
Down. Good idea.

257
00:24:32,887 --> 00:24:34,479
Trade.

258
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,001
Aka.

259
00:24:52,087 --> 00:24:54,647
A Cha' Aka.

260
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,718
Te Chaka.

261
00:24:57,647 --> 00:25:01,196
- Ta?
- Um, a Cha' Aka.

262
00:25:01,287 --> 00:25:03,596
Te... Daniel.

263
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:05,643
Dan'el.

264
00:25:06,807 --> 00:25:08,206
"Dan'el" is fine.

265
00:25:08,287 --> 00:25:13,441
Te Kor Asek. Zo.

266
00:25:13,527 --> 00:25:16,917
"Kor" is "iron". "Asek"?

267
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:22,405
Iron Shirt. The alpha male.

268
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:24,557
Kel, Ko Tar?

269
00:25:24,647 --> 00:25:26,558

270
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:32,316
'Uman ka ne.

271
00:25:32,407 --> 00:25:34,125
Kel Ko keka?

272
00:25:34,207 --> 00:25:38,405
Uh, yes, we brought death,
but we want to be friends.

273
00:25:38,487 --> 00:25:40,398
To preserve life.
Ska nat.

274
00:25:40,487 --> 00:25:46,437
Ska nat.
Unas, Kor Asek, A Chaka, A 'uman.

275
00:25:46,527 --> 00:25:49,724
- Ska nat Te.
- Right. We work this out, we all win.

276
00:25:57,127 --> 00:25:59,516
Cho'ee'che, Chaka.

277
00:26:03,887 --> 00:26:05,878
Dan'el.

278
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:18,398
Cho'ee'che, Kor Asek.

279
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:29,646
OK.

280
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:31,524
All right.

281
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:33,598
Now we're talking, huh?

282
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:39,558
Dr Jackson, how'd it go?

283
00:26:39,647 --> 00:26:43,640
I figured out why they attacked us.
It's this mine. It's sacred to them.

284
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:49,040
Their ancestors were worked to death
by the Goa'uld while they were mining it.

285
00:26:49,127 --> 00:26:51,561
I said I'd speak to my superiors
on their behalf.

286
00:26:51,647 --> 00:26:56,038
Burial sites are protected on Earth. Those
rules should apply here. We have to leave.

287
00:26:56,127 --> 00:26:58,595
We got the results of the resonance scan.

288
00:26:58,687 --> 00:27:04,478
The deposit is over 300 metres in length
and almost completely solid.

289
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,476
53,000 metric tons.

290
00:27:09,567 --> 00:27:11,683
We're not going anywhere.

291
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:20,837
My meeting with the Unas went well.

292
00:27:20,927 --> 00:27:23,885
They're reluctant to trust us,
but we're communicating.

293
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:28,836
- How many of them are there?
- I only saw a medium-sized clan. Why?

294
00:27:28,927 --> 00:27:32,681
We need to know
if we're going to relocate them.

295
00:27:32,767 --> 00:27:35,759
They'll never accept it, sir.
They won't understand it.

296
00:27:35,847 --> 00:27:38,236
Then it's your job
to make them understand.

297
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:42,684
If you don't, we'll have to go in there
with tranquillisers and capture them.

298
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:46,476
They're not animals. I'm sure
Chaka and I can accomplish something.

299
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:49,161
Just let me go talk to them again.

300
00:27:49,247 --> 00:27:52,922
You have 24 hours
to convince the Unas to come peacefully,

301
00:27:53,007 --> 00:27:55,680
or they'll be forcibly removed.

302
00:28:03,927 --> 00:28:06,487
'Uman Ko Keka Onac.

303
00:28:06,567 --> 00:28:08,444
Unas Ko Keka Onac.

304
00:28:08,527 --> 00:28:13,043
Right. We should not fight each other.
The Goa'uld are our common enemy.

305
00:28:13,127 --> 00:28:17,405
- Ka nay.
- Ka nay. Friend. Uh, clan member.

306
00:28:18,887 --> 00:28:20,718
'Uman Ka nay.

307
00:28:20,807 --> 00:28:23,480
That's right. That's right.

308
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,159
So...

309
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,805
We're going to give you food.

310
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,642
'Uman Ko Nan Unas.

311
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:55,998
And, in exchange,

312
00:28:56,087 --> 00:28:58,601
we need... this.

313
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:00,795
Kada.

314
00:29:00,887 --> 00:29:04,960
Kada. Yes. We need Kada
to make war with the Goa'uld.

315
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:07,845
'Uman Ko Kada,

316
00:29:07,927 --> 00:29:10,566
Tonok tok Onac.

317
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:17,966
- Kel?
- How? We make ships out of it.

318
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:21,923
Um...

319
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:38,556
Right. Why would either of you
know what a ship was?

320
00:29:40,727 --> 00:29:42,524
Uh...

321
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:45,638
This.

322
00:29:46,247 --> 00:29:48,238
You know what this is.

323
00:29:48,327 --> 00:29:49,806
Kekata.

324
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:51,605
Kekata, yes.

325
00:29:51,687 --> 00:29:54,963
We can make Kekata with this - Kada.

326
00:29:57,527 --> 00:30:02,317
Now, with many Kekata,

327
00:30:02,407 --> 00:30:06,241
we can bring death to the Goa'uld,
the Onac.

328
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:08,798
Ka Keka Onac.

329
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:10,957
That's right.

330
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:25,084
Hold.

331
00:30:29,927 --> 00:30:33,636
'Uman A Unas Ma Kan Nok.

332
00:30:35,007 --> 00:30:37,567
- Kel?
- Why?

333
00:30:37,647 --> 00:30:42,960
Because if we don't come to
some sort of agreement, 'uman Zo...

334
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:45,277

335
00:30:46,847 --> 00:30:48,041
Relocate.

336
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:50,846
- Ta "relocate"?
- Shesh?

337
00:30:56,527 --> 00:30:58,245
Ka Ko Ka Cha.

338
00:30:58,327 --> 00:30:59,726
Ko Ka Cha.

339
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:02,082
'Uman Ko Ka Cha Unas Ka No na.

340
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:04,397
Away from your home.

341
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,318
Ko Ka Cha Unas Ka No na?

342
00:31:08,247 --> 00:31:09,839
- Tok!
- No.

343
00:31:09,927 --> 00:31:12,919
Defiance will only lead
to Unas bloodshed. Ka tok.

344
00:31:13,007 --> 00:31:15,885
'Uman Ko Keka Te.

345
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:18,162
Keka Unas.

346
00:31:18,247 --> 00:31:21,125
'Uman Ko Keka Te Unas.

347
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:23,596
Unas Ko Keka Te 'uman.

348
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:26,838
No, you won't give us death.
You can't win.

349
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:29,760
A Unas Nay A Tok!

350
00:31:30,327 --> 00:31:32,887
All the tribes will fight.

351
00:31:32,967 --> 00:31:34,764
How many?

352
00:31:34,847 --> 00:31:36,963
Uh, Kel Ka Naya?

353
00:31:37,047 --> 00:31:39,686
Soseka.

354
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:44,637
No. That's impossible.

355
00:31:48,127 --> 00:31:50,197
Teal'c, come in.

356
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:53,518
Teal'c, this is Daniel.
Do you read me? Over.

357
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:55,598
Dammit. Um...

358
00:31:58,087 --> 00:32:00,396
Just wait here. Lota.

359
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:02,478
Lota. Lota. Lota.

360
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:08,247
- Oh, God.
- What happened?

361
00:33:08,327 --> 00:33:11,683
It was coming up on my position.
It was attacking.

362
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:14,076
It was attacking...

363
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:17,677
The necklace.

364
00:33:21,407 --> 00:33:26,083
This necklace was precious to him. He
was coming back for it, and we killed him.

365
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,237
- I didn't know.
- No need to apologise.

366
00:33:30,447 --> 00:33:32,244
Tatack.

367
00:33:35,047 --> 00:33:38,642
- They are preparing to attack.
- Let 'em. We're ready.

368
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:40,718
No, you're not.

369
00:33:45,327 --> 00:33:48,842
- Colonel, we have to get out of here now.
- I don't buy it.

370
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:52,920
- Are you hearing this?
- They'd have been seen by aerial scans.

371
00:33:53,007 --> 00:33:55,965
Unas live in caves
where aerial scans don't detect them.

372
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:57,844
Our position will be overrun.

373
00:33:57,927 --> 00:34:01,317
I was close to working out an agreement.
They wanna be left alone.

374
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:11,002
Dan'el!

375
00:34:23,247 --> 00:34:27,399
- Hold your fire!
- If they attack, we will defend ourselves.

376
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:17,004
You're right, Dr Jackson.
Let's get back to the gate.

377
00:35:17,087 --> 00:35:21,205
No, it's too late.
If we move now, they'll run us down.

378
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:33,164
- What's he doing?
- I don't know.

379
00:35:41,487 --> 00:35:43,955
Don't do anything stupid.

380
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:49,963
- He's giving us a chance.
- A chance to do what?

381
00:35:59,247 --> 00:36:01,556
To surrender.

382
00:36:01,647 --> 00:36:04,445
Surrender? Not possible.

383
00:36:04,527 --> 00:36:06,518
Don't do it, Colonel.

384
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:17,844
Kor Asek.

385
00:36:18,767 --> 00:36:21,361
'Uman A Ta Ka Keka.

386
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:25,235
- What are you saying?
- That we don't have to kill each other.

387
00:36:25,327 --> 00:36:27,477
'Uman A Te A Ka Naya.

388
00:36:28,527 --> 00:36:30,324
We can be of the same tribe.

389
00:36:30,407 --> 00:36:33,046
A Ka Naya Keka Onac.

390
00:36:34,167 --> 00:36:37,159
Together we can bring death
to the Goa'uld.

391
00:36:37,247 --> 00:36:39,602
- Tak!
- Trick?

392
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:43,043
Dan'el, cho'ee'che.

393
00:36:43,807 --> 00:36:47,595
'Uman Ko Keka Unas.

394
00:36:47,687 --> 00:36:52,761
He's saying that while we talk peace,
humans kill Unas. He doesn't believe me.

395
00:36:53,847 --> 00:36:56,361
We have to show respect.

396
00:36:56,447 --> 00:37:00,326
- We have to get down on the ground.
- On the ground? There's no way I'm...

397
00:37:00,407 --> 00:37:03,080
Colonel, this is the way
their social order works!

398
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:06,477
We have to show submissiveness
to show we're not a threat.

399
00:37:06,567 --> 00:37:11,561
We have to get down on the ground,
and that is all we have to do.

400
00:37:21,367 --> 00:37:23,517
Colonel, everyone.

401
00:37:23,607 --> 00:37:24,960
Please!

402
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,518
Benna?

403
00:37:56,647 --> 00:38:00,686
A Benna A Tar 'uman.

404
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:11,960
On 'or.

405
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:16,516
"Honour."

406
00:38:16,607 --> 00:38:18,563
He understands.

407
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,998
Cho'ee'che, Kor Asek.

408
00:39:09,407 --> 00:39:11,875
Now we can negotiate.

409
00:39:19,327 --> 00:39:21,636
How long do we have to kneel?

410
00:39:25,727 --> 00:39:27,558
As long as it takes.

411
00:39:41,167 --> 00:39:44,318
A Cha' Aka, Dan'el.

412
00:39:44,407 --> 00:39:46,398
A Cha' Aka, Kor Asek.

413
00:39:53,487 --> 00:39:58,038
- I think we've got ourselves a deal.
- And what deal would that be?

414
00:39:58,127 --> 00:40:01,802
- We won't desecrate their sacred ground.
- We won't?

415
00:40:01,887 --> 00:40:05,960
In exchange, the Unas will help defeat
their ancestors' killers, the Goa'uld.

416
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:08,800
And just how are they going to do that?

417
00:40:08,887 --> 00:40:11,879
They're gonna work the mine themselves.

418
00:40:11,967 --> 00:40:14,276
What?

419
00:40:14,367 --> 00:40:18,246
- Did you propose this?
- No, actually, it was Iron Shirt.

420
00:40:22,647 --> 00:40:27,960
So the Unas are gonna mine this deposit
and turn all the naqahdah over to us?

421
00:40:28,047 --> 00:40:30,038
That's right.

422
00:40:33,087 --> 00:40:36,045
Can they work a jackhammer?

423
00:40:36,127 --> 00:40:39,597
I think you'll find
they're very intelligent and can learn.

424
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:45,717
You treat them with respect and you'll
find out what kind of allies they can be.

425
00:40:45,807 --> 00:40:48,605
O'Neill was right about you.

426
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:52,321
You are a pain in the ass.

427
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:57,085
But... well worth it.

428
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:09,198
Dan'el.

429
00:41:11,127 --> 00:41:13,038
Aka.
