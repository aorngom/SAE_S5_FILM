1
00:00:06,407 --> 00:00:08,875
Unscheduled
offworld activation.

2
00:00:17,847 --> 00:00:20,361
It's SG-1's IDC, sir.
Receiving audio, sir.

3
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:21,880
On speaker.

4
00:00:21,967 --> 00:00:24,925
Close quarters withdrawal.
It's gonna get ugly.

5
00:00:25,007 --> 00:00:28,716
Acknowledged, Colonel.
We'll be ready. Just give us the word.

6
00:00:28,807 --> 00:00:31,002
Watch your friendlies. Safeties off.

7
00:00:31,087 --> 00:00:33,840
Clean targets. Clean backgrounds.

8
00:00:36,247 --> 00:00:39,717
Teal'c, let's go/
Base, this is it. We're on our way.

9
00:00:39,807 --> 00:00:41,365
Open the iris.

10
00:00:48,927 --> 00:00:51,077
Teal'c's right behind us.

11
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:05,198
Clear!

12
00:01:14,847 --> 00:01:16,917
Med team, get in there.

13
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:21,118
Teal'c?

14
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,158
Come on.

15
00:01:25,807 --> 00:01:28,446
- I'm not getting a pulse.
- Start CPR.

16
00:01:28,527 --> 00:01:32,520
Give me one milligram epi.
Prepare to intubate.

17
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:59,766
You had us all very worried.

18
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:01,963
That was not my intention.

19
00:03:02,047 --> 00:03:05,642
The staff blast hit you
directly in the symbiote pouch.

20
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:09,083
- If you weren't on tretonin...
- I would be dead.

21
00:03:10,887 --> 00:03:13,082
Ironic.

22
00:03:13,767 --> 00:03:16,076
Well, you're not out of the woods yet.

23
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:19,005
Woods?

24
00:03:19,087 --> 00:03:21,362
You have more healing to do.

25
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:28,078
The staff blast passed through the empty
symbiote pouch and damaged your spine.

26
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:31,204
In the past, I could have let
your symbiote regenerate it.

27
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:34,757
With work, you should be able
to make a full recovery.

28
00:03:38,647 --> 00:03:41,684
- Teal'c?
- The Jaffa that wounded me?

29
00:03:42,487 --> 00:03:46,366
Died. His symbiote
was damaged beyond repair.

30
00:03:49,247 --> 00:03:52,876
Look, I know this is hard for you...

31
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:57,045
but you're very lucky to be alive.

32
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:01,400
Colonel O'Neill planted my radio
in the underbrush

33
00:04:01,487 --> 00:04:04,445
and began broadcasting
to create a distraction.

34
00:04:04,527 --> 00:04:07,439
The Jaffa fell for this and
half of them left the temple.

35
00:04:07,527 --> 00:04:09,722
We engaged the rest and escaped.

36
00:04:09,807 --> 00:04:12,879
Were you able to ascertain
who these Jaffa were loyal to?

37
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:16,357
The forehead tattoos were of
various System Lords, mainly Baal.

38
00:04:16,447 --> 00:04:19,644
- Baal?
- His empire has expanded fast.

39
00:04:19,727 --> 00:04:25,279
No surprise to us, since he now controls
the United Alliance of the System Lords,

40
00:04:25,367 --> 00:04:27,961
something we're responsible for.

41
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:30,402
To level the playing field against Anubis.

42
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,001
So, in a way, we did it to ourselves.

43
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:35,157
- Sir.
- How is he?

44
00:04:35,247 --> 00:04:39,035
It's gonna be a long road back,
but he should get there.

45
00:04:39,127 --> 00:04:42,563
I boosted his tretonin dosage
to stem off any residual infection.

46
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:44,922
- Can we see him?
- Yeah.

47
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:53,364
My son? Why do you ask?

48
00:04:53,447 --> 00:04:56,996
I just thought you'd be sick of
"How're you feeling?" again.

49
00:04:57,087 --> 00:04:58,315
Indeed.

50
00:04:58,407 --> 00:05:00,557
No, I was just thinking about him.

51
00:05:00,647 --> 00:05:04,606
Rya'c is with Bra'tac.
They are attempting to recruit rebel Jaffa.

52
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:09,124
I have not heard from them,
and do not expect to for some time.

53
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,198
What's with the, uh...?

54
00:05:13,527 --> 00:05:15,483
O'Neill.

55
00:05:15,567 --> 00:05:19,845
I believe his offer of coloured gelatin
was his attempt to sympathise.

56
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:22,487
Ah, well, he's thoughtful that way.

57
00:05:22,567 --> 00:05:24,603
There's no need.

58
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:26,678
I blame only myself.

59
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,399
- How is it your fault?
- I fell behind.

60
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:33,998
- I was...
- Covering us.

61
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:39,646
Teal'c?

62
00:05:39,727 --> 00:05:42,958
I wish to be alone, Daniel Jackson.

63
00:05:50,407 --> 00:05:52,398
OK.

64
00:05:53,647 --> 00:05:55,638
OK.

65
00:05:59,447 --> 00:06:02,245
No/ Master/

66
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,482
So they fly
halfway across the galaxy,

67
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:21,717
in a highly advanced spaceship,

68
00:06:21,807 --> 00:06:24,685
but don't use their technology
to take over the planet.

69
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,123
You know what their weakness
turned out to be? Water.

70
00:06:28,207 --> 00:06:32,803
Why go to all the trouble to invade
a planet that's two-thirds water?

71
00:06:32,887 --> 00:06:35,196
Not to mention the rain!

72
00:06:35,287 --> 00:06:38,120
Why do you watch those movies?
All you do is cut 'em up.

73
00:06:38,207 --> 00:06:45,318
Don't you occasionally like to see if
they're getting it anywhere close to right?

74
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:47,439
Hello?!

75
00:06:47,527 --> 00:06:50,360
- What?
- Are you OK?

76
00:06:50,447 --> 00:06:52,563
Ever feel you forgot something important?

77
00:06:52,647 --> 00:06:55,844
- What do you mean?
- Well...

78
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:59,442
I can remember almost everything
from before I died,

79
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:02,360
but I can't remember anything
from when I was ascended.

80
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,915
Lately something's been nagging at me.

81
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:09,000
Something specific.
I just can't pin it down.

82
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:11,605
Very good, Teal'c.

83
00:07:11,687 --> 00:07:13,678
OK, you're done.

84
00:07:16,527 --> 00:07:18,324
Teal'c!

85
00:07:26,007 --> 00:07:30,762
- Looks like you're doing better.
- There is such a thing as overdoing it.

86
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:36,444
Teal'c, it is possible to aggravate
your condition by pushing too hard.

87
00:07:41,527 --> 00:07:43,518
Leave me be.

88
00:07:44,887 --> 00:07:48,323
No/ Master/

89
00:07:52,087 --> 00:07:54,396
Daniel?

90
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:58,565
Any technical anomalies
during an incoming wormhole

91
00:07:58,647 --> 00:08:03,721
are noted in this box and cross-referenced
and detailed here. It's pretty dry.

92
00:08:03,807 --> 00:08:07,516
- The mission files cover points of interest.
- I've been over those.

93
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:11,202
- If I knew what you were looking for...
- We wouldn't be doing this.

94
00:08:11,287 --> 00:08:13,278
Why do you think the answer's here?

95
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,564
I have a feeling it has something
to do with an incoming wormhole.

96
00:08:16,647 --> 00:08:20,845
I was hoping that looking at some of
this stuff might jog my memory somehow.

97
00:08:20,927 --> 00:08:23,441
It must be tough.

98
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:28,362
The hardest part is not knowing
whether or not I chose to be here like this.

99
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:32,235
Whether I could be doing
more good if I was still...

100
00:08:32,327 --> 00:08:34,238
Ascended?

101
00:08:34,327 --> 00:08:36,477
Yeah.

102
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:44,563
Well, this should be everything
you need. Good luck.

103
00:08:44,647 --> 00:08:46,638
Thanks.

104
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:01,516
That's the last of
the physical examination.

105
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:06,522
You have just lifted and pulled more
weight than anyone on this base ever has.

106
00:09:06,607 --> 00:09:09,679
Alien technology notwithstanding.

107
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,964
Teal'c?

108
00:09:16,047 --> 00:09:18,845
I'm clearing you for active duty.

109
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:23,482
I am not ready.

110
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:38,042
- Still nothing?
- I've broadened my search

111
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:41,836
to include outgoing wormholes
and unauthorised activations.

112
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:45,158
I still have no idea what I'm looking for.

113
00:09:45,247 --> 00:09:49,445
Maybe if you stop thinking about it
it'll come to you.

114
00:09:51,767 --> 00:09:53,598
Take a break.

115
00:09:53,687 --> 00:09:56,281
Fraiser says Teal'c needs a little pep talk.

116
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:59,040
I've been practising in front of a mirror.

117
00:09:59,127 --> 00:10:01,402
- Not peppy enough?
- Not really.

118
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,358
Don't give me the eyebrow.

119
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:16,919
Something's bothering you. Something
was bothering you before this injury.

120
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:20,477
- We're pretty sure we know what it is.
- Then there is no mystery.

121
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:23,445
Yeah, but the point is,
you have to talk about it.

122
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:31,566
OK, you don't have to talk about it,
but you'll feel better if you do.

123
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:37,646
You know, forget that crap.
I'm your commanding officer.

124
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:40,844
And you must be kept informed
of my fitness.

125
00:10:40,927 --> 00:10:44,283
Fraiser says you're ready for duty now.
Is that true?

126
00:10:45,287 --> 00:10:47,676
I have been dishonest with you.

127
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:48,882
Oh?

128
00:10:48,967 --> 00:10:53,279
It is unacceptable. All Jaffa children
know this without being told.

129
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:57,485
They are born with the knowledge.
It will not be tolerated.

130
00:10:58,527 --> 00:11:01,121
- What?
- Kek.

131
00:11:03,847 --> 00:11:07,237
- "Death." You mean "death"?
- Weakness.

132
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:12,446
We use one word for both. For if one
is weak, one may as well be dead.

133
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:16,441
You're talking about the tretonin.

134
00:11:16,527 --> 00:11:20,566
I believed it to be the answer of liberation
for all Jaffa from the Goa'uld

135
00:11:20,647 --> 00:11:22,638
and the reliance on symbiotes.

136
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:25,446
But as soon as I began to take it
things changed.

137
00:11:25,527 --> 00:11:28,485
I felt my capability
was being compromised.

138
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:35,006
But I said nothing, hoping the effects were
temporary and my strength would return.

139
00:11:35,087 --> 00:11:37,237
It did not.

140
00:11:38,887 --> 00:11:40,366
OK...

141
00:11:40,447 --> 00:11:46,124
- Forgive me, O'Neill. I should have...
- No. There's nothing to forgive.

142
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:53,081
You're still twice as strong as I'll ever be,
and you've got two good knees.

143
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:56,204
Then the answer to your question is no.

144
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,085
I do not feel that I am fit for duty.

145
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:01,203
OK.

146
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,847
I can accept that. For now.

147
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:21,397
- Not exactly peppy.
- What did you want me to say to the guy?

148
00:12:21,487 --> 00:12:24,285
He's lost his confidence.
He wants you to reinstall some.

149
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:28,485
If he really has lost his mojo,
nothing I can say will get it back for him.

150
00:12:28,567 --> 00:12:33,197
- It's all in his head.
- If he doesn't think he's ready, he's not.

151
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:47,281
Without a symbiote,
kelno'reem is unnecessary.

152
00:12:47,367 --> 00:12:50,086
- I have discontinued the practice.
- Yeah.

153
00:12:50,167 --> 00:12:53,921
I know you don't need to kelno'reem
any more, but just indulge me.

154
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:57,079
Humans meditate even though
they still require REM sleep.

155
00:12:57,167 --> 00:13:00,398
- I think this thing I can't remember...
- Daniel Jackson.

156
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:04,844
For a successful kelno'reem, there is
one element required above all others.

157
00:13:04,927 --> 00:13:07,566
- What?
- Silence.

158
00:13:08,127 --> 00:13:10,163
Right.

159
00:13:19,247 --> 00:13:21,715
No/ Master/

160
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:23,559
Master, no/

161
00:13:23,647 --> 00:13:27,037
Master/ No, master/

162
00:13:40,247 --> 00:13:42,044
Kree! Ha'shak!

163
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:46,604
Leave him alone.

164
00:13:48,887 --> 00:13:51,720
No! Master!

165
00:13:51,807 --> 00:13:53,638
Master, no/

166
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:56,924
Master/ No, master/

167
00:13:59,207 --> 00:14:02,005
- Rya'c?
- Yeah.

168
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:04,726
Yeah, I saw him and Bra'tac.

169
00:14:04,807 --> 00:14:06,798
I think they're in danger.

170
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:10,118
Are you familiar with
the ambush of Kresh'ta?

171
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:12,402
The Jaffa rebel tribes.
I read the report.

172
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:15,638
106 warriors slaughtered.
Only you and Bra'tac survived.

173
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:19,845
You sustained both of your lives
by passing a symbiote between you.

174
00:14:19,927 --> 00:14:23,602
There is something
that is not in the report.

175
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:27,644
As I lay near death, I began to dream.

176
00:14:29,087 --> 00:14:32,204
You used your abilities and appeared
to me in that dream.

177
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:37,804
- I did?
- Indeed.

178
00:14:37,887 --> 00:14:42,756
When I had recovered you appeared to me
again, and that is when I knew.

179
00:14:44,047 --> 00:14:47,642
You had stayed with me
and watched over me for three days.

180
00:14:47,727 --> 00:14:51,959
And that is the reason I am eternally
grateful to you, Daniel Jackson.

181
00:14:52,047 --> 00:14:56,199
And why I wholeheartedly
believe you concerning Rya'c.

182
00:14:56,287 --> 00:14:59,802
- So you believe me too?
- The things I've heard sitting here?!

183
00:14:59,887 --> 00:15:02,242
If this happened before
you retook human form,

184
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:06,206
then whatever supply of tretonin
Bra'tac had would be depleted by now.

185
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:08,517
That is why we must act immediately.

186
00:15:08,607 --> 00:15:11,599
Daniel, you thought all this
had to do with gate records.

187
00:15:11,687 --> 00:15:14,076
Perhaps you knew to look for a location.

188
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:17,443
I've been through those records.
I haven't found anything.

189
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:20,803
Teal'c, is there anything familiar
about the planet?

190
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:22,878
There is not.

191
00:15:23,887 --> 00:15:27,880
General Hammond, I request
that we send for Rak'nor immediately.

192
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:30,356
- Do it.
- Yes, sir.

193
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,642
You grow more and more weak each day.

194
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:17,321
You worry too much for me, Rya'c.

195
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:19,398
Tend to your own labour.

196
00:16:25,487 --> 00:16:27,478
A kek ha'shak! Ya duru!

197
00:16:45,287 --> 00:16:47,926
If you do not work,

198
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,998
you will die.

199
00:16:51,807 --> 00:16:54,605
They do not work hard enough.

200
00:16:54,687 --> 00:16:59,124
No rescue is forthcoming...
and your supply of tretonin runs low.

201
00:16:59,207 --> 00:17:01,357
Rya'c!

202
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:02,596
Kree-ga!

203
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:11,917
We will not be able to maintain
our workload. They will execute us next.

204
00:17:12,007 --> 00:17:12,962
Kree!

205
00:17:17,087 --> 00:17:18,486
Kek.

206
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:33,845
Have faith. I will ration
my tretonin, until a rescue.

207
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:43,075
Kek.

208
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,758
Kol'va!

209
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,878
Is any of this familiar to you?

210
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:15,483
A planet with two moons, a naqahdah
refinery near some sort of dry dock

211
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:17,683
with a mother ship under construction?

212
00:18:17,767 --> 00:18:20,759
I know the planet of which you describe.
Erebus.

213
00:18:20,847 --> 00:18:25,238
According to Greek mythology,
Erebus is where condemned souls pass.

214
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:29,400
It is aptly named. The planet is used
for the construction of Ha'tak vessels

215
00:18:29,487 --> 00:18:32,001
and the purification
of naqahdah to build them.

216
00:18:32,087 --> 00:18:34,078
Only Jaffa prisoner labour is used.

217
00:18:34,167 --> 00:18:37,796
They can withstand the heat and
toxic gases of the blast furnaces

218
00:18:37,887 --> 00:18:40,162
fed by underground volcanic systems.

219
00:18:40,247 --> 00:18:44,206
- Eventually, even the Jaffa succumb.
- I am aware of such places.

220
00:18:44,287 --> 00:18:48,724
Jaffa prisoners, unwilling to serve their
Goa'uld masters, are worked to death.

221
00:18:48,807 --> 00:18:52,004
The perfect place to recruit rebels.
Something's gone wrong.

222
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:54,123
The planet was recently taken by Baal.

223
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:57,677
If Bra'tac and Rya'c were there then,
perhaps they were trapped.

224
00:18:57,767 --> 00:18:59,837
- Then they are lost.
- Why?

225
00:18:59,927 --> 00:19:02,600
- The Stargate on Erebus is impenetrable.
- How so?

226
00:19:02,687 --> 00:19:07,761
A force field much like your iris blocks it,
making rescue through it impossible.

227
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,644
Someone must get through.

228
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:12,799
We believe a signal is used
to power down the force field.

229
00:19:12,887 --> 00:19:15,765
But we have no way of knowing
what that signal is.

230
00:19:18,487 --> 00:19:19,636
Now!

231
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,762
I was there. I saw the whole thing happen.

232
00:19:54,847 --> 00:19:59,238
Nothing I could do - just watch,
powerless to interfere.

233
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:03,480
- Come on, it has to be there.
- Just give me a minute.

234
00:20:03,567 --> 00:20:07,845
I never thought of checking
the Alpha site gate records.

235
00:20:07,927 --> 00:20:11,078
A coded energy signal
was received and recorded

236
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:13,203
through the gate three months ago.

237
00:20:13,287 --> 00:20:16,324
No one was able to determine
its origin or its purpose.

238
00:20:16,407 --> 00:20:19,922
That is the deactivation code Bra'tac sent
before he was captured.

239
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:21,486
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

240
00:20:21,567 --> 00:20:25,924
I can synthesise this. If it is the code,
I can get us through the gate.

241
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:29,477
And I can provide details of their defences
and the lay of the land.

242
00:20:34,287 --> 00:20:35,959
O'Neill.

243
00:20:36,967 --> 00:20:40,676
I must tell you that I believe
I may be a liability on this mission.

244
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:42,359
I don't.

245
00:20:42,447 --> 00:20:45,678
If I should die,
it is my wish that you watch over Rya'c.

246
00:20:46,727 --> 00:20:50,163
Let's see it doesn't come to that, all right?

247
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:53,842
Chevron six encoded.

248
00:20:57,847 --> 00:21:00,566
- It's his son.
- Chevron seven locked.

249
00:21:04,447 --> 00:21:06,836
All right, let's do this.

250
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:12,998
Sending signal now.

251
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,845
Clear.

252
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:34,122
OK, so... that happened.

253
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:39,359
SG-3, secure these guys,
then establish your perimeter.

254
00:21:39,447 --> 00:21:41,438
Daniel.

255
00:22:11,327 --> 00:22:13,761
Master Bra'tac.

256
00:22:13,847 --> 00:22:16,805
It is difficult to ration
that which you do not have.

257
00:22:18,327 --> 00:22:21,717
- If only you had not seen.
- I have seen.

258
00:22:22,727 --> 00:22:25,958
Now tell me the truth. I'm not a child.

259
00:22:27,727 --> 00:22:29,718
The tretonin is gone.

260
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:35,004
Then you will die, and all your words
of faith will have been for nothing.

261
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:38,079
No, Rya'c, not for nothing. For you!

262
00:22:39,807 --> 00:22:41,638
You might survive.

263
00:22:43,967 --> 00:22:46,640
How long can you live without tretonin?

264
00:22:47,647 --> 00:22:49,638
As long as I have to.

265
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:22,958
Penhall.

266
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:26,802
Trade. Give me that thing.

267
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:34,087
No sign of Bra'tac.

268
00:23:36,567 --> 00:23:38,956
Wait a minute. I've got Rya'c.

269
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:51,478
If we eliminate that guard position,
we can create a blind spot.

270
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:03,324
Infiltration is the best option, O'Neill.

271
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:08,481
All right, it'll be dark in an hour.

272
00:24:08,567 --> 00:24:11,479
Everybody, get comfortable.

273
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:33,198
Go.

274
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:50,597
- They're in.
- Jaffa, hol/

275
00:24:52,487 --> 00:24:55,399
- Jaffa/
- Come on, come on.

276
00:24:58,847 --> 00:25:00,075
Rin nok/

277
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,840
- What's this?
- He's dressing the warrior down.

278
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:06,237
"Do the bidding of Baal. Shut up."

279
00:25:06,327 --> 00:25:09,444
- "Shut up"?!
- I'm paraphrasing.

280
00:25:09,527 --> 00:25:12,724
Kel mar tokeem. Tal ma kree.

281
00:25:13,567 --> 00:25:15,046
Meg tal.

282
00:25:15,127 --> 00:25:19,325
"You're poisoned. You're cursed by
the wearer of horns. You're sloppy."

283
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:22,524
- Oracca aseemu.
- Oh, for crying out loud!

284
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:26,637
- Hol mel/
- Damn it.

285
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:29,446
- I think they've been made.
- Just hold on.

286
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,676
- Rya'c.
- Father.

287
00:25:51,767 --> 00:25:56,283
I'm sorry. Master Bra'tac said
you would come, but I did not believe.

288
00:25:56,367 --> 00:26:01,043
- How is he?
- He still lives, but I fear not for long.

289
00:26:02,767 --> 00:26:05,156
Tek matte.

290
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,962
Old friend.

291
00:26:11,327 --> 00:26:14,160
- Rak'nor.
- Tek matte, Master Bra'tac.

292
00:26:16,087 --> 00:26:18,555
There is enough for both of us.

293
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:26,037
You cannot hide here for long.

294
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,721
It will take time for him
to regain his strength.

295
00:26:28,807 --> 00:26:32,641
- Then we will carry him.
- We came to take you and Bra'tac away.

296
00:26:33,727 --> 00:26:36,878
What about them?
What about all the others?

297
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:39,276
There are too many.

298
00:26:39,927 --> 00:26:42,316
- They can fight.
- And they will die.

299
00:26:42,807 --> 00:26:45,719
If they stay, they will die.

300
00:26:54,687 --> 00:26:58,521
Teal'c! You've been made.
Get outta there. Get outta there!

301
00:26:58,607 --> 00:27:00,837
Teal'c/

302
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:06,806
Kree chok!

303
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:19,841
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

304
00:27:49,727 --> 00:27:52,366
- Sir.
- Just hold your position.

305
00:27:57,767 --> 00:28:02,682
- We're just gonna sit here?
- Yes! We're just gonna sit here.

306
00:28:02,767 --> 00:28:05,361
Till we can find another way in.

307
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,721
Rya'c. You are still alive.

308
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,766
Yes, Father.

309
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:40,917
That is all that matters.

310
00:28:42,607 --> 00:28:44,802
What of Bra'tac?

311
00:28:45,687 --> 00:28:48,963
The tretonin has helped.

312
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:51,845
What of you, Father? Can you walk?

313
00:28:53,447 --> 00:28:55,722
Not at the moment.

314
00:28:57,647 --> 00:28:59,797
You must.

315
00:28:59,887 --> 00:29:02,720
Those who cannot work are killed.

316
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:07,881
You must not lose your faith, Rya'c.
Rak'nor and I did not come alone.

317
00:29:10,967 --> 00:29:14,004
Even now, a rescue is under way.

318
00:29:21,007 --> 00:29:25,159
Search patrol went off in that direction,
heading for the Stargate.

319
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:29,240
They don't believe Teal'c and Rak'nor
were working alone.

320
00:29:29,327 --> 00:29:33,445
- This is my fault.
- How's that?

321
00:29:33,527 --> 00:29:36,325
I should have done something
when I had the chance.

322
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,523
When I had the power.

323
00:29:39,407 --> 00:29:44,845
I think we've already established
that wouldn't have worked out either.

324
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:47,122
Nope, it's time for plan B.

325
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:52,126
- We have a plan B?
- No, but it's time for one.

326
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:56,359
We've already determined
there are too many guards for us.

327
00:29:56,447 --> 00:29:59,086
We need a distraction.

328
00:30:00,327 --> 00:30:03,558
- Grenades?
- Think bigger.

329
00:30:03,967 --> 00:30:06,037
Claymores?

330
00:30:08,847 --> 00:30:11,156
Much bigger.

331
00:30:46,367 --> 00:30:49,359
Major, target TRP-1.

332
00:30:57,247 --> 00:30:59,715
His strength still grows.

333
00:31:00,647 --> 00:31:02,717
Good.

334
00:31:02,807 --> 00:31:06,197
Rya'c, you and Rak'nor
must spread the word.

335
00:31:06,287 --> 00:31:11,236
If we wish for our rescue to be successful,
the others must be prepared to fight.

336
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:15,286
- How will they know when?
- When the time is right they will know.

337
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:17,085
Indeed.

338
00:31:18,087 --> 00:31:20,442
Can you fight?

339
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:25,126
- I am not the Jaffa I once was.
- No!

340
00:31:25,207 --> 00:31:26,959
- Rya'c...
- No.

341
00:31:27,047 --> 00:31:29,880
You are Teal'c.
There is no greater warrior.

342
00:31:29,967 --> 00:31:32,561
Rya'c!

343
00:31:32,647 --> 00:31:36,799
I am... weak.

344
00:31:37,727 --> 00:31:39,638
No... Father, please.

345
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:42,002
Rya'c!

346
00:31:42,087 --> 00:31:45,875
No matter what...
you must survive.

347
00:31:45,967 --> 00:31:48,037
You must survive.

348
00:31:50,127 --> 00:31:52,880
Or I have come for nothing.

349
00:31:55,087 --> 00:31:56,884
Now go.

350
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:19,877
Once this panel goes it'll take seconds
for the anti-gravity platform to shut down.

351
00:32:36,367 --> 00:32:38,358
It has been difficult.

352
00:32:39,287 --> 00:32:42,040
For both of us.

353
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,118
You are feeling better.

354
00:32:45,847 --> 00:32:48,645
You will not be rid of me so easily.

355
00:32:50,247 --> 00:32:53,637
When the time comes
I will be ready, old friend.

356
00:32:53,727 --> 00:32:56,321
As will I.

357
00:32:56,407 --> 00:32:58,398
I am not so sure.

358
00:33:00,047 --> 00:33:05,121
This tretonin seems to have
had an effect on your memory.

359
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:07,482
Why would you say such a thing?

360
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:12,595
You've forgotten that a warrior's strength
comes from his heart and his mind.

361
00:33:14,807 --> 00:33:18,766
You have had a physical advantage
over me for a long time,

362
00:33:18,847 --> 00:33:23,523
and yet I have never
lost a sparring match to you.

363
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:28,601
Because for years, old man,
I have let you win.

364
00:33:33,927 --> 00:33:35,565
Better.

365
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:39,678
Much better.

366
00:34:10,207 --> 00:34:12,198
This could be a problem.

367
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:35,922
This is not your work station.

368
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,396
Take him.

369
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:59,243
If you do not work, then you will die!

370
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:02,558
This one does not know
where his work station is.

371
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:10,002
But he is young... and still able to work.

372
00:35:15,167 --> 00:35:17,237
You dare to speak to me?

373
00:35:18,487 --> 00:35:20,955
Only to ask that I take his place.

374
00:35:24,487 --> 00:35:26,284
So be it.

375
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,717
No! No!

376
00:35:40,647 --> 00:35:42,638
You are barely able to stand.

377
00:35:42,727 --> 00:35:46,925
You would not have lasted another day.
It was a good trade.

378
00:35:52,087 --> 00:35:55,875
- Carter, what's the hold-up?
- We're a go in 30 seconds, sir.

379
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:58,640
Assume we do not have 30 seconds.

380
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:05,915
You were once the first prime of Apophis.

381
00:36:06,007 --> 00:36:09,556
Now you're nothing
but a weak, pathetic shol'va.

382
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,118
Do not look away.

383
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:16,960
Be strong for him.

384
00:36:17,047 --> 00:36:22,997
What better way for Teal'c to die than
to be looking upon the face of his son?

385
00:37:17,007 --> 00:37:19,441
Kree! Trey lon tonok!

386
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:33,166
Fire!

387
00:37:41,327 --> 00:37:44,399
Take them now!

388
00:38:04,927 --> 00:38:07,202
Come on, boys, have at 'em.

389
00:38:50,847 --> 00:38:52,360
Wait!

390
00:39:14,087 --> 00:39:16,078
Father!

391
00:39:29,927 --> 00:39:31,485
Welcome back, SG-1.

392
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:35,685
The camp has been liberated. All the
prisoners relocated to the Alpha site.

393
00:39:35,767 --> 00:39:37,962
They are anxious to join the rebellion.

394
00:39:38,047 --> 00:39:41,244
Then my mission has been a success.

395
00:39:41,927 --> 00:39:46,876
Hammond of Texas,
I find myself once more in your debt.

396
00:39:47,647 --> 00:39:50,161
I think it's Dr Jackson you owe
on this one.

397
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:54,476
Indeed.

398
00:40:01,727 --> 00:40:08,360
Kelno'reem is unnecessary.
Although it does make me feel... better.

399
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:18,076
Colonel O'Neill has officially informed me
that I have my "mojo" back.

400
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:23,040
I guess I should be thanking you, actually.

401
00:40:23,127 --> 00:40:26,802
You see, I used to...
I used to feel like I didn't belong.

402
00:40:26,887 --> 00:40:28,878
Anywhere, really.

403
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:34,084
I think I thought that this ascension
thing would change that.

404
00:40:34,167 --> 00:40:39,400
Now I'm realising that
the sacrifices were far too great...

405
00:40:40,967 --> 00:40:44,516
and my life here is too important
to just leave behind.

406
00:40:44,607 --> 00:40:47,440
I guess what I'm trying to say is that...

407
00:40:47,527 --> 00:40:52,362
for the first time in my life
I feel like I'm a part of something.

408
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:55,358
Something important.

409
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,676
As do I.

410
00:41:56,207 --> 00:41:58,801
