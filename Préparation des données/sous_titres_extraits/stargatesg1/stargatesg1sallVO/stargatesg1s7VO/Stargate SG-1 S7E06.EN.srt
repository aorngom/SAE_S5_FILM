1
00:00:16,607 --> 00:00:21,237
Possibly the beacon we detected with the
MALP was activated remotely on impact.

2
00:00:21,327 --> 00:00:24,637
If anyone is in those forward sections,
I doubt they survived.

3
00:00:24,727 --> 00:00:30,723
There should be an indication somewhere
about how long ago they crashed.

4
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:45,644
Sir, these people are alive.

5
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:49,276
At least, they're in
some form of cryogenic sleep.

6
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:53,201
Any civilisation without faster-than-light
technology would resort to this

7
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:55,755
to cross the vast distances between stars.

8
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:59,362
Otherwise, it'd take an entire generation,
and given the effects...

9
00:00:59,447 --> 00:01:02,519
We've got a shipload of frozen people.

10
00:01:03,447 --> 00:01:05,961
That would be
the more succinct way of putting it.

11
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:11,326
Their current states probably
protected them from the impact.

12
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:23,439
How many do you think there are?

13
00:01:23,527 --> 00:01:28,282
From the configuration of the ship's
exterior, four sections of varying size.

14
00:01:28,367 --> 00:01:32,440
We'll do a quick head count, see what
we're dealing with, then call for support.

15
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:36,725
Carter, Teal'c, you pair up.
Daniel and I will start in this compartment.

16
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:38,877
Yes, sir.

17
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:10,886
Five.

18
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:12,605
Six.

19
00:02:16,207 --> 00:02:17,879
105.

20
00:02:23,247 --> 00:02:24,965
Jack!

21
00:04:26,447 --> 00:04:28,244
O'Neill?

22
00:04:32,247 --> 00:04:33,760
Major Carter?

23
00:04:34,927 --> 00:04:37,236
Daniel Jackson, respond.

24
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:14,436
O'Neill.

25
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:33,003
Major Carter.

26
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:00,718
Daniel Jackson.

27
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:12,723
It's SG-4's IDC, sir.
They're signalling that they've got SG-1.

28
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:17,039
Defence and medical team, stand by.
Open the iris.

29
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,805
- What have we got?
- Both unconscious, but stable.

30
00:06:34,887 --> 00:06:39,324
Get them to the infirmary
and maintain security protocols.

31
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:41,443
Daniel?

32
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:45,281
I have to go back. I have to go back.

33
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:50,481
I have to go back.
I have to go back to the ship!

34
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:53,240
- No! No!
- Daniel.

35
00:06:53,327 --> 00:06:56,319
Daniel... It's OK. Don't be afraid.

36
00:06:57,087 --> 00:06:59,157
Sergeants!

37
00:07:00,687 --> 00:07:02,837
It's OK.

38
00:07:02,927 --> 00:07:04,918
Who are you?

39
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,156
What is this place?

40
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:26,800
Notify me the moment
they regain consciousness.

41
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:39,640
Who is responsible for this?
I demand to know why this has happened!

42
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:42,956
Why am I a prisoner?

43
00:07:43,047 --> 00:07:45,481
Those may be removed
when you calm down.

44
00:07:45,567 --> 00:07:48,035
Calm? How do you expect me to be calm?

45
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:52,040
I was made promises
that nothing could go wrong.

46
00:07:52,127 --> 00:07:55,199
All right, let's start there.
Tell me what has gone wrong.

47
00:07:55,287 --> 00:07:57,323
What has gone wrong.
What has gone wrong.

48
00:07:57,407 --> 00:08:02,162
Well, this is not the Stromos, you are not
a member of my staff, and that is not me!

49
00:08:02,247 --> 00:08:05,319
All right, listen carefully.
We did not do this.

50
00:08:05,407 --> 00:08:09,002
We're in the dark about what
has happened as much as you are.

51
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:13,956
- If you cooperate...
- I will undergo no more of your tests.

52
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,919
- Are you in pain?
- Yes!

53
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,444
Yes, a great deal.

54
00:08:21,527 --> 00:08:24,087
All right. I'll get something.

55
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:27,955
In the meantime, try to stay calm,
or you'll be restrained further.

56
00:08:28,047 --> 00:08:31,244
You have no idea who I am, do you?

57
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:42,285
- That is not Daniel Jackson.
- But is he a Goa'uld?

58
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:45,518
No, sir, although at the moment
he's every bit as arrogant.

59
00:08:45,607 --> 00:08:48,758
Then is he suffering from
some sort of mental illness?

60
00:08:48,847 --> 00:08:53,363
I don't know yet, sir. His preliminary EEG
readings are like nothing I've ever seen.

61
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:56,245
There's indication of coma,
but at the same time,

62
00:08:56,327 --> 00:09:01,196
we're seeing readings like those of
a dozen people all jumbled together.

63
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:05,678
- Is his condition life-threatening?
- I couldn't even guess.

64
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:12,640
He claims to be a passenger from
the crashed alien vessel we discovered.

65
00:09:12,727 --> 00:09:16,083
- How's that possible?
- I have no idea, but Teal'c is right.

66
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,920
And we're dealing with
more than one passenger.

67
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:23,046
Daniel's behaviour in the gate room
and throughout the preliminary testing

68
00:09:23,127 --> 00:09:25,516
was distinctly different than now.

69
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:29,646
I'd say we've witnessed at least two,
maybe even three, personalities.

70
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:31,206
Could there be more?

71
00:09:31,287 --> 00:09:35,883
We discovered several hundred
passengers in cryogenic suspension.

72
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:49,202
O'Neill requested an enumeration
of the cryogenic chambers.

73
00:09:49,287 --> 00:09:55,283
We separated and I lost consciousness
momentarily. For what reason, I'm unsure.

74
00:09:55,367 --> 00:10:00,122
When I returned, I found Daniel Jackson,
O'Neill and Carter in their current states.

75
00:10:00,207 --> 00:10:04,120
Speaking of which, sir, I'd like
to check in on the colonel and Sam.

76
00:10:04,207 --> 00:10:06,038
- Keep me apprised.
- Yes, sir.

77
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:08,641
Maybe you should head down
to the infirmary.

78
00:10:08,727 --> 00:10:11,639
I intend to remain here.

79
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:13,319
Very well.

80
00:10:20,047 --> 00:10:23,596
- I'm ordinarily a very rational man.
- Of course, Dr Jackson.

81
00:10:23,687 --> 00:10:27,077
I am a sovereign of Talthus.
My name is Martice.

82
00:10:27,607 --> 00:10:29,245
Beg your pardon, sir.

83
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:32,125
Oh, "sir". Well, that's a start.

84
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:38,997
Pupils are still a little dilated.

85
00:10:39,087 --> 00:10:43,160
It's as though they were struck with
some sort of powerful zat weapon.

86
00:10:43,247 --> 00:10:46,478
- At least their EEGs are still normal.
- Oi!

87
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,558
Doctor?

88
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:53,196
Inform General Hammond
the colonel's awake.

89
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:57,238
- Hey, Doc.
- How are you feeling, sir?

90
00:10:57,327 --> 00:10:59,124
Headache. Bad.

91
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:05,046
I can take care of that, but first
I need to know if you're feeling... yourself.

92
00:11:05,127 --> 00:11:09,917
Well, other than this nail
through my head, I'm fine.

93
00:11:10,007 --> 00:11:12,362
- Why?
- I'll explain later.

94
00:11:12,447 --> 00:11:16,963
Teal'c got the three of you to the Stargate
from the ship. My team took it from there.

95
00:11:17,047 --> 00:11:19,003
Carter and Daniel?

96
00:11:19,087 --> 00:11:24,081
Major Carter is suffering
the same after-effects as you, sir.

97
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:25,520
Janet?

98
00:11:25,607 --> 00:11:26,835
Sam.

99
00:11:27,887 --> 00:11:32,961
Hey. It's gonna be fine. You've both
suffered some sort of neural shock.

100
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:40,322
Colonel, Major, how are you feeling?

101
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:44,958
- Got a nail in my head, sir.
- That sounds like our Colonel O'Neill.

102
00:11:45,047 --> 00:11:49,245
Their EEGs show normal brain activity.
They appear to be unaffected.

103
00:11:49,327 --> 00:11:51,283
Unaffected by what?

104
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,161
Where's Daniel?

105
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:02,362
I need you to stay where you are,
at least until you're strong enough.

106
00:12:02,447 --> 00:12:04,915
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not, sir.

107
00:12:05,887 --> 00:12:07,479
Ow.

108
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:10,798
No, I'm not.

109
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:17,163
Just find the small woman and tell her that
what she gave me is not good enough.

110
00:12:17,247 --> 00:12:19,238
It isn't working.

111
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:25,196
Do you speak?

112
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:37,844
- How are you feeling now?
- Your medicine is worthless.

113
00:12:37,927 --> 00:12:39,918
Are you still in pain?

114
00:12:40,007 --> 00:12:43,397
- This body must be damaged.
- I doubt that.

115
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:46,126
Dr Jackson was in perfect health.

116
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,199
I assume Dr Jackson was the former.

117
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:57,683
Not that I have anything against it.
It's younger and stronger than my own.

118
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:01,877
Did something happen to my own body?

119
00:13:02,927 --> 00:13:07,159
In times of disaster, people need their
sovereign. How will they recognise me?

120
00:13:07,247 --> 00:13:11,718
- I've already told you we didn't do this.
- How else could I be in this situation?

121
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:13,525
We don't know.

122
00:13:18,607 --> 00:13:21,565
How useful you are.

123
00:13:25,607 --> 00:13:30,158
- What is this place?
- It's one of our medical isolation rooms.

124
00:13:30,247 --> 00:13:32,203
Could you be less specific?

125
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:35,922
In a military facility
on a planet called Earth.

126
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:38,485
Earth.

127
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,003
The ship was bound for Ardena.
How far are we from Ardena?

128
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,078
I don't know.

129
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:49,196
The other passengers...

130
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:53,081
they will be concerned for me.

131
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:56,045
As I am for them, of course.

132
00:13:57,247 --> 00:14:03,846
Most of them are still on the ship, but we
think several of them may be with us now.

133
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:07,966
- As prisoners?
- No, we think they may be in this room.

134
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:13,606
We don't know the reason, but several of
the passengers in cryogenic sleep have...

135
00:14:15,167 --> 00:14:17,681
What's happening?

136
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,405
Martice?

137
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:27,682
No, Martice is a sovereign.
I'm just a crew member.

138
00:14:35,687 --> 00:14:37,678
Is that...?

139
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:54,918
- How can this be?
- It's all right. I'm here to help you.

140
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:57,521
No, no. This is wrong.
This is a mistake.

141
00:14:57,607 --> 00:15:00,997
Yes, it is, one that we want to correct.

142
00:15:01,087 --> 00:15:03,078
I'm Dr Fraiser.

143
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:06,963
I am Tryan. Engineer, second rank.

144
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:11,120
All right, Tryan, why don't we start again?

145
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:15,564
Again?

146
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:24,761
I don't recognise this man.

147
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:32,239
Or, rather, myself.

148
00:15:32,327 --> 00:15:36,400
His name is Daniel Jackson. The body
you're inhabiting belongs to him.

149
00:15:36,487 --> 00:15:39,843
- He wasn't aboard the Stromos.
- No.

150
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,963
Then how can I have
ended up in his body?

151
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:48,086
Your ship crashed
on a planet that we call P2A-347.

152
00:15:48,167 --> 00:15:50,362
We don't know how or why
the crash occurred,

153
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:53,564
only that the only survivors
were those in cryogenic sleep.

154
00:15:53,647 --> 00:15:57,720
When Daniel Jackson and the other
members of his team boarded your ship,

155
00:15:57,807 --> 00:15:59,798
this happened.

156
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:06,163
- I have no memory of coming here.
- What do you remember?

157
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,039
Brace for acceleration. Tryan?

158
00:16:11,127 --> 00:16:14,597
- Compartment is secure, sir.
- Very well.

159
00:16:22,327 --> 00:16:28,800
Leaving Talthus, entering my sleep
chamber, then seeing your face here.

160
00:16:30,247 --> 00:16:32,636
- Why am I restrained?
- It wasn't you.

161
00:16:32,727 --> 00:16:37,164
You're the fourth personality to emerge
since being brought back.

162
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:41,843
We believe that there are others
from your ship in there along with you.

163
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:44,282
- In one body?
- Plus Dr Jackson.

164
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:47,962
No. The strain on the body
would be too great. It wouldn't survive.

165
00:16:48,047 --> 00:16:51,801
- Do you know that for certain?
- The only result would be insanity.

166
00:16:51,887 --> 00:16:56,278
- Then we should both hope you're wrong.
- What's happened is impossible.

167
00:16:56,367 --> 00:17:00,076
This can't happen. One cannot return
to any other body than one's own.

168
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,079
There are fail-safes
to prevent that from happening.

169
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:08,036
It has happened.
Look in the mirror to prove it to yourself.

170
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:16,318
We don't have a lot of time, and you're
the first personality that's been helpful,

171
00:17:16,407 --> 00:17:21,003
so I need you to think, all right?
How could this happen?

172
00:17:23,487 --> 00:17:30,006
A sleeper's consciousness is stored in the
same memory that maintains their body.

173
00:17:30,087 --> 00:17:32,396
There is simply no way to separate them

174
00:17:32,487 --> 00:17:38,005
or send the consciousness to any other
than its corresponding body, unless...

175
00:17:38,087 --> 00:17:40,078
Oh, no.

176
00:17:42,447 --> 00:17:45,723
Unless the sleepers' bodies are dead.

177
00:17:56,607 --> 00:18:01,965
O'Neill. Major Carter.
I am pleased to see you have recovered.

178
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:05,278
- How is he?
- Yet another personality has emerged.

179
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:09,280
- Dr Fraiser seems to be making progress.
- How did he get stuck in here?

180
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:13,645
Daniel Jackson's preliminary
electroencephalogram proved anomalous.

181
00:18:13,727 --> 00:18:16,321
I dare you to say that again.

182
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:21,604
Dr Fraiser declared a code 17. Dr Jackson
has been under constant guard.

183
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:26,477
Only she and a few of her staff have
had any direct contact as a precaution.

184
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:30,685
- She thought he was a Goa'uld?
- Not any more, but I'm taking no chances

185
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:35,079
until we determine how these persons
have found their way into Dr Jackson.

186
00:18:35,167 --> 00:18:38,045
I'd need another look
at their cryogenic systems.

187
00:18:38,127 --> 00:18:40,516
Schedule a mission briefing
with Dr Fraiser.

188
00:18:40,607 --> 00:18:43,440
Sir, I'd like to stick it out here with Daniel.

189
00:18:43,527 --> 00:18:46,325
Only medical personnel
are allowed access.

190
00:18:46,407 --> 00:18:49,001
- Yes, sir.
- Very well.

191
00:19:02,087 --> 00:19:04,476
Let's not jump to conclusions.

192
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:08,162
I'm sorry. There's simply no other way
this could have happened.

193
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:13,446
Only then can the fail-safes be overridden
and the consciousness leave the system.

194
00:19:13,527 --> 00:19:17,520
I am dead, as are the others
who may reside in this body.

195
00:19:17,607 --> 00:19:22,397
- We can't be sure till we go to the planet.
- Well, you will see.

196
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:25,356
Help me out with something here.

197
00:19:25,447 --> 00:19:29,076
Why separate the consciousness
from the body in the cryosleep process?

198
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:33,797
A consciousness can't survive restoration
without loss of memory and intellect.

199
00:19:33,887 --> 00:19:37,846
A person taking such a journey without
proper storage of their consciousness

200
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:43,399
would arrive as a fraction of themselves.
The essence of that person would be lost.

201
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,001
So the memory requirement
must be enormous.

202
00:19:46,087 --> 00:19:51,719
Each cryogenic capsule contains a matrix
memory module to sustain one mind.

203
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:56,358
Its systems are connected with those that
sustain the corresponding sleeper's body.

204
00:19:56,447 --> 00:20:00,406
Then it may be possible to upload your
consciousness back into that memory.

205
00:20:00,487 --> 00:20:03,763
- Each module stores one consciousness.
- Do it one at a time.

206
00:20:03,847 --> 00:20:06,839
No, that's not possible. Here.

207
00:20:14,167 --> 00:20:18,206
Could these water molecules be returned
to this glass just as they were before,

208
00:20:18,287 --> 00:20:21,643
in precisely the same configuration?

209
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:29,086
No.

210
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:34,480
Our minds were blended, poured into one
vessel ill-equipped to sustain our volume.

211
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:39,277
But if the computers on your ship can
separate the human mind from the body,

212
00:20:39,367 --> 00:20:42,325
- then surely they can isolate...
- Can you hear that?

213
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:45,285
No, I can't hear anything.

214
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:50,122
The others, their voices, I can hear them.
They're getting louder.

215
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,085
I need you to stay with me.
We need to work together.

216
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,727
- It feels incredible.
- The others can't help.

217
00:20:55,807 --> 00:20:57,957
- No one can help.
- Don't say that.

218
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:01,835
They're pulling at me now.
I don't know how...

219
00:21:10,007 --> 00:21:11,725
Janet?

220
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,436
- Daniel?
- What's going on?

221
00:21:15,527 --> 00:21:21,523
Something has happened. I need you to
just stay with me, OK? Just hang in there.

222
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:28,404
That's it. A moment later, another person
emerged, but we learnt nothing from her.

223
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:32,082
So, he only surfaced for a moment,
but it was definitely Daniel.

224
00:21:32,167 --> 00:21:34,761
- At least we know he's still in there.
- Mm-hm.

225
00:21:34,847 --> 00:21:39,079
Dr MacKenzie just did a detailed analysis
of his EEG and MRI readings.

226
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:43,365
We think Daniel is in a sort of coma,
having been suppressed by the others.

227
00:21:43,447 --> 00:21:46,644
It's like his consciousness
has retreated, protecting itself.

228
00:21:46,727 --> 00:21:49,400
That's why he could
only surface for a short time.

229
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:53,765
- The other signals are a jumbled mess.
- How many others are there?

230
00:21:53,847 --> 00:21:58,477
Dr MacKenzie believes Daniel could be
carrying the minds of as many as a dozen

231
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,762
of the ship's passengers.

232
00:22:00,847 --> 00:22:04,396
Maybe I could reconfigure
the ship's systems to separate Daniel.

233
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:06,637
You were attacked on that ship.

234
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:10,720
- It may have been automated defences.
- I think not, Major Carter.

235
00:22:10,807 --> 00:22:15,756
I discovered Daniel at the base of one of
the sleep chambers. The door was open.

236
00:22:15,847 --> 00:22:18,202
Daniel wouldn't have
stepped in on his own.

237
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:21,040
Then someone else must have done so.

238
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:25,200
Perhaps I regained consciousness before
his assailant could do the same to us.

239
00:22:25,287 --> 00:22:28,245
The question is, why?

240
00:22:28,327 --> 00:22:31,797
Tryan seemed absolutely sure
that his physical body was dead.

241
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:33,605
So?

242
00:22:33,687 --> 00:22:36,997
What if this was a desperate attempt
to preserve these people?

243
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:41,046
What if your attacker was trying to keep
these people alive the only way he could?

244
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:44,039
The ship could not have
sustained them indefinitely.

245
00:22:44,127 --> 00:22:48,086
- So Daniel's a lifeboat?
- Yeah, it's possible.

246
00:22:48,167 --> 00:22:51,716
Sir, I recommend that SG-12
accompany us back to the planet.

247
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:56,244
They can search the ship for whoever did
this while I study the cryogenic systems.

248
00:22:56,327 --> 00:22:58,795
You have a go. Dismissed.

249
00:23:08,407 --> 00:23:11,524
I don't think
we've had a chance to meet.

250
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:13,598
Where's my father?

251
00:23:13,687 --> 00:23:17,919
I'm sorry, I don't know.
Do you mind if I sit down beside you?

252
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:21,879
OK.

253
00:23:23,727 --> 00:23:26,924
- There.
- What about them?

254
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:29,237
Oh, no, they won't hurt you.

255
00:23:34,127 --> 00:23:39,155
Why don't I tell you everything I know,
and then we'll just take it from there, OK?

256
00:23:40,727 --> 00:23:42,718
What's your name?

257
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,963
- Keenin.
- Keenin?

258
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:49,642
That's a very nice name.
I'm Dr Fraiser.

259
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:55,362
SG-12, move out.

260
00:23:56,487 --> 00:23:58,762
I know you'd do anything
to save Dr Jackson,

261
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:01,566
but the last thing we need
is for this to happen to you.

262
00:24:01,647 --> 00:24:03,842
We intend to avoid that, sir.

263
00:24:03,927 --> 00:24:05,918
Good luck.

264
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:17,003
Keenin, we're trying to figure out
all we can about how this happened.

265
00:24:17,087 --> 00:24:20,124
What's the last thing you remember?

266
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:22,437
My father.

267
00:24:25,847 --> 00:24:28,884
Why can't I wait with you?

268
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:34,519
The ship must accelerate to escape
the flare's radiation. You'll be safer here.

269
00:24:34,607 --> 00:24:37,838
You will dream sweet dreams,

270
00:24:37,927 --> 00:24:42,637
and when you awaken,
we'll be in orbit around Ardena,

271
00:24:42,727 --> 00:24:45,287
and I will be right here.

272
00:24:45,927 --> 00:24:48,316
Talthus will be gone.

273
00:24:48,407 --> 00:24:51,683
Hundreds of years
will have passed, Keenin,

274
00:24:51,767 --> 00:24:56,761
and all of this hardship
will be part of our distant history.

275
00:24:58,007 --> 00:25:00,396
Do you understand?

276
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:09,044
Now...

277
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:13,396
close your eyes.

278
00:25:19,687 --> 00:25:24,078
- I wanted to stay on Talthus.
- So you had to leave?

279
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:28,046
They knew it was gonna happen
since a long time before I was born.

280
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:32,803
- Do you know what a dark star is?
- Mm-hm. One that's burned out its fuel.

281
00:25:32,887 --> 00:25:36,562
They said it would pass
close enough to our sun to make it flare

282
00:25:36,647 --> 00:25:38,956
and that it would engulf Talthus.

283
00:25:39,047 --> 00:25:42,357
I knew my whole life
that the world was gonna end.

284
00:25:42,447 --> 00:25:45,007
So your people built the "Stromos".

285
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:50,036
They built three ships, including
the Stromos, but it wasn't enough.

286
00:25:50,127 --> 00:25:53,802
They had a lottery, and they said
that was the only fair way.

287
00:25:53,887 --> 00:25:56,276
But my father was
an officer on the Stromos,

288
00:25:56,367 --> 00:26:00,645
so he was allowed to pick
one person from his family.

289
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:04,519
M-m-my mother made him choose me.

290
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:06,762
It's all right.

291
00:26:06,847 --> 00:26:12,604
My mother said she'd take her chance
with the lottery, but she wasn't chosen.

292
00:26:12,687 --> 00:26:15,759
The sovereigns were chosen,
but she wasn't chosen.

293
00:26:15,847 --> 00:26:18,725
No one I knew was chosen.

294
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:22,845
I wanted to stay with her.

295
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:29,559
It's OK. Shh. It's all right.

296
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:32,207
It's all right. Shh. It's OK.

297
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:39,955
What are you doing?

298
00:26:40,927 --> 00:26:42,724
Martice?

299
00:26:47,207 --> 00:26:51,997
You may address me as Sovereign,
and I will ask you never to do that again.

300
00:26:53,807 --> 00:26:57,800
Now, what have you done to resolve this?

301
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:09,838
SG-12, this is Carter. Come in.

302
00:27:09,927 --> 00:27:15,365
- This is SG-12. We just began our search.
- Stay in radio contact. Carter out.

303
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:21,044
These power levels are extremely low.
I don't know how it could still be working.

304
00:27:21,127 --> 00:27:24,836
Perhaps if we revived one of them,
they may be of some assistance.

305
00:27:24,927 --> 00:27:29,125
I don't think there's even
enough power to do that.

306
00:27:31,047 --> 00:27:33,515
I demand to speak
to someone in authority.

307
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:36,075
Well, I'm sorry. You're stuck with me.

308
00:27:36,167 --> 00:27:38,761
Why have you involved the boy in this?

309
00:27:38,847 --> 00:27:40,997
What boy?

310
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:44,284
The boy. You were just talking to him.

311
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:47,758
Where is he?

312
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:55,725
If we don't get these systems hooked up
to a power source, these people will die.

313
00:27:55,807 --> 00:28:00,403
I'll need a naqahdah generator,
and I'll have to build...

314
00:28:06,447 --> 00:28:09,519
One generator should be enough.

315
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:16,037
Please, don't hurt us.

316
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:30,806
Tell them to stop shouting.
It is unendurable.

317
00:28:30,887 --> 00:28:32,605
I can't hear them.

318
00:28:35,407 --> 00:28:37,398
Be silent/

319
00:28:37,487 --> 00:28:40,320
- They're in your mind, Martice.
- No.

320
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:41,806
No, no, no, no, no, no.

321
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:47,166
What you say, it cannot be so.
I have responsibilities to attend to.

322
00:28:47,247 --> 00:28:49,442
- I cannot remain here.
- You cannot leave.

323
00:28:49,527 --> 00:28:53,406
3,000 of our people depend on me
to lead them. I am the sovereign.

324
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:56,285
- I'm sorry.
- It is my destiny to rule over Ardena!

325
00:28:56,367 --> 00:28:59,404
You don't understand
the seriousness of your condition.

326
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:03,366
- You don't realise who you are talking to.
- I don't give a damn.

327
00:29:03,447 --> 00:29:08,726
You don't belong in that man's body,
and I intend to take it back.

328
00:29:14,487 --> 00:29:16,876
Are there other conscious people?

329
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,446
No.

330
00:29:18,527 --> 00:29:20,916
The others still sleep.

331
00:29:21,887 --> 00:29:25,084
- Why have you come back?
- You did something to one of our people.

332
00:29:25,167 --> 00:29:27,681
- Is he here with you?
- He is not.

333
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,565
Are you the one responsible?

334
00:29:32,207 --> 00:29:35,404
There was... no choice...

335
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:38,716
no other way.

336
00:29:40,367 --> 00:29:42,722
- You must do the same.
- I don't think so.

337
00:29:42,807 --> 00:29:48,006
The ship's power is failing.
It is the only way we can save them.

338
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:54,238
Pharrin figured out a way
to override the fail-safes.

339
00:29:54,327 --> 00:29:57,319
It can be done. Don't you see?

340
00:29:57,407 --> 00:30:02,959
These souls are the last of an entire world.
They cannot be allowed to end like this.

341
00:30:03,047 --> 00:30:05,686
- Maybe there's another way.
- No. No.

342
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:08,565
Power is fading even now
in every compartment.

343
00:30:08,647 --> 00:30:13,596
If you carried a handful of souls, we could
route the remaining power to the others.

344
00:30:13,687 --> 00:30:16,406
That's not gonna happen.

345
00:30:16,487 --> 00:30:20,366
We do not know how many more
we can accommodate.

346
00:30:20,447 --> 00:30:22,244
"We"?

347
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:26,843
I believe he too
carries the consciousness of many.

348
00:30:26,927 --> 00:30:30,237
13 souls now reside in Pharrin's body.

349
00:30:30,327 --> 00:30:33,637
I fear I can harbour no more.

350
00:30:33,727 --> 00:30:37,117
Why do you attempt to preserve
these lives? Their bodies are dead.

351
00:30:37,207 --> 00:30:41,883
We are the last of an entire world.
The other ships will come.

352
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:46,483
We have sent a message.
They will hear it and they will come.

353
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:49,365
And when they do
they will find a way to restore us.

354
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:53,122
Why did you not attempt
to revive the others?

355
00:30:54,967 --> 00:30:59,757
After the ship crashed -
we still don't know why it happened -

356
00:30:59,847 --> 00:31:05,001
he was revived by the computer, but
the power requirement of his restoration

357
00:31:05,087 --> 00:31:08,636
caused too great a drain
in the rest of the compartment.

358
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:11,446
Power levels were dropping.

359
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:16,157
Pharrin had only minutes to restore power
to 12 of the sleeper chambers

360
00:31:16,247 --> 00:31:19,398
before the occupants were dead.

361
00:31:19,487 --> 00:31:22,240
But there wasn't enough time.

362
00:31:22,327 --> 00:31:25,717
Pharrin was failing them one by one.

363
00:31:26,607 --> 00:31:30,395
There was no other choice.

364
00:31:30,487 --> 00:31:33,206
No other way to preserve us.

365
00:31:36,767 --> 00:31:41,318
There are over a thousand souls
aboard the Stromos.

366
00:31:41,407 --> 00:31:45,320
If Pharrin had attempted to revive the
others, then many more may have died.

367
00:31:45,407 --> 00:31:49,525
- Even one person to share the burden.
- Pharrin walked as far as he could see.

368
00:31:49,607 --> 00:31:51,757
There was little more than rock.

369
00:31:51,847 --> 00:31:57,160
Neither was there sufficient water or food
remaining aboard after the crash.

370
00:31:57,247 --> 00:32:00,444
Pharrin dare not revive another soul.

371
00:32:02,927 --> 00:32:05,236
We are not alone.

372
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:08,876
We live in a democracy of one.

373
00:32:08,967 --> 00:32:12,084
It is strange, yes,

374
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:16,206
but we are the chosen survivors
of an entire race.

375
00:32:16,287 --> 00:32:19,165
How could Pharrin have allowed
even one of us to be lost?

376
00:32:19,247 --> 00:32:21,966
Still, we could have helped you.

377
00:32:22,847 --> 00:32:25,964
There was... no time.

378
00:32:26,047 --> 00:32:29,357
We should have asked them.
No, we could not take the chance.

379
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,324
You...

380
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:34,399
would never have consented...

381
00:32:35,447 --> 00:32:38,007
would you?

382
00:32:38,087 --> 00:32:39,486
We would not.

383
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:41,762
Then...

384
00:32:41,847 --> 00:32:44,042
we chose correctly.

385
00:32:44,967 --> 00:32:48,846
Our mistake was to flee when you
revived so quickly from our stun weapon

386
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:50,997
and returned for your friends.

387
00:32:51,087 --> 00:32:54,318
But too many of us were afraid.

388
00:32:55,447 --> 00:32:57,961
There are other ways
we can help.

389
00:32:58,047 --> 00:32:58,877
How?

390
00:32:58,967 --> 00:33:02,084
We could provide you with
an alternate power source,

391
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:06,922
to bring your energy reserves up to where
they need to be to revive your people.

392
00:33:07,007 --> 00:33:10,841
It's possible I can retrieve it
and have it running within a few hours.

393
00:33:10,927 --> 00:33:14,920
There is no other way. Listen to her!
No. We must wait. The ships will come.

394
00:33:15,007 --> 00:33:19,603
We can take you anywhere you want
to go - another world, like Ardena.

395
00:33:19,687 --> 00:33:22,121
You have a ship?

396
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:27,918
There's a device capable of transporting
your people instantaneously to any world.

397
00:33:28,007 --> 00:33:30,316
We call it a Stargate.

398
00:33:31,167 --> 00:33:34,762
- Such a device is not possible.
- Come with us and I'll prove it to you.

399
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:39,602
However, we will only consent to do so
if you return our friend to his former state.

400
00:33:39,687 --> 00:33:43,475
- He is preserving life.
- At the expense of his own, unwillingly.

401
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:47,276
Please... do not ask us to do this.

402
00:33:47,367 --> 00:33:49,323
We're not asking.

403
00:33:50,127 --> 00:33:54,359
The souls that your friend carries within
him are amongst the most precious of all.

404
00:33:54,447 --> 00:33:57,245
Our friend is equally as important to us.

405
00:33:57,327 --> 00:34:01,957
There will be nowhere for them to go.
They will be lost.

406
00:34:02,047 --> 00:34:04,436
But it is possible to undo this?

407
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:10,406
How can I abandon them so easily?

408
00:34:10,487 --> 00:34:14,241
We have sworn to protect the sovereign.
But we may save hundreds of others.

409
00:34:14,327 --> 00:34:15,965
Pharrin!

410
00:34:26,327 --> 00:34:28,522
There is a way.

411
00:34:30,407 --> 00:34:34,286
Do you understand that what we're
offering could save everyone on this ship?

412
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:40,761
And do you understand that one of the
souls that your friend carries within him...

413
00:34:43,127 --> 00:34:45,038
is my son?

414
00:34:54,407 --> 00:34:57,046
Please! Why does it hurt so much?

415
00:35:00,327 --> 00:35:04,320
All right.
Prepare 100 micrograms of fentanyl.

416
00:35:09,127 --> 00:35:14,963
That won't be necessary. I seem to have a
higher threshold for pain than the others.

417
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:17,515
- Tryan?
- Yes.

418
00:35:17,607 --> 00:35:20,075
Oh, thank God for that.

419
00:35:21,207 --> 00:35:22,959
Janet?

420
00:35:23,047 --> 00:35:26,403
- Can I have a word?
- I'll be back.

421
00:35:39,127 --> 00:35:44,326
- Are you sure you trust this guy?
- He has much to gain by assisting us.

422
00:35:51,087 --> 00:35:54,841
Officer Pharrin, sir.
Engineer Tryan, second rank.

423
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:03,846
Tryan. Of course. Of all of our crew, you
would have thought this was not possible.

424
00:36:03,927 --> 00:36:08,284
Of all our crew, sir, you're the one who'd
find a way to do it. How did you manage?

425
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:13,202
Our training, and a shared will to survive.

426
00:36:13,287 --> 00:36:18,805
It is a strange way of living with others,
but it is better than the alternative.

427
00:36:20,807 --> 00:36:24,197
What of our ship and her passengers, sir?

428
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:32,920
Our ship crash-landed.

429
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:35,362
We failed to reach Ardena.

430
00:36:35,447 --> 00:36:40,840
Her passengers may yet be saved,
but not without considerable sacrifice

431
00:36:40,927 --> 00:36:45,842
to you and to the others of the Stromos
that reside within you.

432
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:50,840
I understand, sir.

433
00:36:50,927 --> 00:36:53,839
These people possess a device

434
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:59,445
capable of transporting
all our people to another world.

435
00:36:59,527 --> 00:37:02,121
Perhaps even Ardena.

436
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:06,325
It is very real, and it will save our people.

437
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:14,197
But in exchange, they ask that their friend
be returned to them as he was before.

438
00:37:15,487 --> 00:37:19,605
I believe it can be done if we act quickly.

439
00:37:20,047 --> 00:37:22,436
It is a reasonable bargain.

440
00:37:22,527 --> 00:37:27,555
I will do whatever is necessary, sir.
Whatever you ask of me.

441
00:37:30,287 --> 00:37:33,882
No! There will be no sacrifice of any kind.

442
00:37:33,967 --> 00:37:38,324
As your sovereign, I demand
you return me to the ship immediately.

443
00:37:38,407 --> 00:37:41,365
- Forgive me, Sovereign.
- Pharrin.

444
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:45,406
We have sworn an oath to do his will.
We cannot proceed.

445
00:37:46,767 --> 00:37:48,325
Officer Pharrin...

446
00:37:50,327 --> 00:37:54,320
I have given you a command.
Do you understand me?

447
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:57,955
Oh, for crying out loud.

448
00:38:01,247 --> 00:38:03,442
- Get up.
- I swore to protect the sovereign.

449
00:38:03,527 --> 00:38:05,518
- He's dead.
- His soul lives.

450
00:38:05,607 --> 00:38:08,565
- Not if I cut him out.
- You would not.

451
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:10,797
Oh, yes, I would.

452
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:13,640
- Pharrin, you will listen to me.
- Don't listen.

453
00:38:13,727 --> 00:38:15,843
Just do what you came here to do.

454
00:38:23,407 --> 00:38:27,764
Forgive us, Sovereign.
It is the only way to protect our people.

455
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:31,157
I will not surrender this body,
not at any cost. It is mine.

456
00:38:31,247 --> 00:38:33,807
It was never ours.
If you save anyone, you will save me.

457
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:35,843
The people of Talthus will die.
Let them!

458
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:37,804
- Forgive me.
- How dare you touch me?

459
00:38:37,887 --> 00:38:42,597
For 12 years we fought to save the people
of Talthus. We will do anything to do so,

460
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:45,884
no matter how great the sacrifice.

461
00:38:55,847 --> 00:38:57,644
Father?

462
00:38:58,847 --> 00:39:00,644
Keenin.

463
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:03,797
I am so sorry, my son.

464
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:11,686
You must sacrifice as well,
and we will be together.

465
00:39:12,367 --> 00:39:14,562
Do you understand?

466
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:22,719
The people of Talthus will be safe
and they will remember us forever.

467
00:39:24,887 --> 00:39:27,162
But we'll be together.

468
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:31,563
We'll be together.

469
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:50,281
Well?

470
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:54,565
I can't tell yet if they made it into Pharrin,
but Daniel's readings are back to normal.

471
00:39:54,647 --> 00:39:57,923
- How did you do that?
- It wasn't me, sir. It was Daniel.

472
00:39:58,007 --> 00:40:01,716
His mind protected itself. He never
emerged for more than a few seconds.

473
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:05,516
That's what let Pharrin separate the others
from Daniel and absorb them.

474
00:40:05,607 --> 00:40:08,041
The more the merrier, I guess.

475
00:40:08,127 --> 00:40:12,678
He'll stay in suspended animation until the
other passengers can take care of him.

476
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,519
You mean them.

477
00:40:21,687 --> 00:40:24,326
The naqahdah generator
will sustain the power.

478
00:40:24,407 --> 00:40:27,001
We can begin
the restoration process within hours.

479
00:40:27,087 --> 00:40:29,999
- We can relocate them shortly after that.
- Good.

480
00:40:30,087 --> 00:40:34,444
We'll leave that for SG-4.
They love that kind of stuff.

481
00:40:34,527 --> 00:40:37,803
- How's Daniel?
- He'll be unconscious for a while.

482
00:40:37,887 --> 00:40:40,242
- It's best if...
- What?

483
00:40:49,167 --> 00:40:50,964
Daniel?

484
00:40:51,847 --> 00:40:53,439
That you?

485
00:40:53,527 --> 00:40:54,926
Jack?

486
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:57,680
- How you doing?
- Bad headache.

487
00:40:57,767 --> 00:41:02,887
- Nail-in-the-head kinda thing?
- Yeah. Something like that.

488
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:04,798
Yeah.
