1
00:00:05,327 --> 00:00:07,716
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

2
00:00:07,807 --> 00:00:10,082
General Hammond?
This is Mr Bregman.

3
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:13,716
No one around here wants to be
part of your little reality show.

4
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:18,278
The President of the United States
invited me to do this.

5
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:21,916
Look, Mr Bregman. You are here
strictly to document what is going on.

6
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:25,238
Not to pursue anything prejudicial
to Air Force personnel.

7
00:00:25,327 --> 00:00:26,316
Call me Emmett.

8
00:00:26,407 --> 00:00:28,762
I'm gonna get you
on camera sooner or later.

9
00:00:28,847 --> 00:00:32,726
Even if all I get is a series of shots
of you avoiding being got.

10
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:35,196
I hope shots of my ass serve you well.

11
00:00:35,287 --> 00:00:37,676
Well, I'll be damned.

12
00:00:38,727 --> 00:00:41,799
- It's my unborn son, sir.
- Take cover!

13
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:47,438
After it engaged weapons
it activated a long-range communicator.

14
00:00:52,527 --> 00:00:54,802
Taking fire! Wells has been hit.

15
00:00:55,327 --> 00:00:57,841
- Are you flirting with me?
- Ah, well...

16
00:00:57,927 --> 00:01:00,487
Excuse me, ma'am.
You're required in the ready room.

17
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,683
That's why we're not allowed to film.

18
00:01:02,767 --> 00:01:06,157
Every time they open that gate,
something could go wrong.

19
00:01:06,247 --> 00:01:08,078
All because I wanted an aerial survey.

20
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:11,159
Took me too long to figure out
it sent a transmission.

21
00:01:11,247 --> 00:01:13,966
None of that matters now.

22
00:01:17,447 --> 00:01:20,041
And now, the conclusion.

23
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:28,684
What's going on? You were scheduled
to get shots of the gate.

24
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:31,327
- We got bumped again.
- Something's up.

25
00:01:31,407 --> 00:01:34,683
- You just missed SG-1 in full gear.
- You got it on tape?

26
00:01:34,767 --> 00:01:37,361
- It's unauthorized.
- Ongoing activity, I know.

27
00:01:37,447 --> 00:01:40,996
But SG-1? Dr Jackson wasn't going
offworld for days. What's changed?

28
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:43,157
- I don't know.
- Something big?

29
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:45,556
Something big happens all the time.

30
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,241
- What's this?
- Follow me.

31
00:01:50,047 --> 00:01:53,357
- Dr Fraiser!
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

32
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:57,645
You're not allowed, Mr Bregman.
And you know that.

33
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,835
There are days when you feel
the pressure. I'm trained to handle it.

34
00:03:04,927 --> 00:03:06,485
With all due respect,

35
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:11,402
how can anyone be trained to handle
an alien encounter where the stakes,

36
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:15,480
if what I'm told is correct,
could be the survival of the planet?

37
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:20,083
It's important to remember
that it's not just about this planet.

38
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:24,046
Countless humans throughout the galaxy,
that originated here on Earth,

39
00:03:24,127 --> 00:03:27,005
have been enslaved
for thousands of years.

40
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:30,079
We're taking the fight to the Goa'uld
on their behalf.

41
00:03:30,167 --> 00:03:33,477
How do you think the world is gonna react

42
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:38,118
when they discover that an alien war
has been waged without their knowledge?

43
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:43,044
I don't think that that's for me to...

44
00:03:45,007 --> 00:03:47,077
Are you suggesting we shouldn't do this?

45
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:52,719
No, I'm not saying we shouldn't defend
ourselves, I'm simply asking your opinion.

46
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,275
I don't think that's for me to, um...

47
00:03:56,727 --> 00:03:59,116
No. Stop it right there.

48
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:01,084
I don't know...

49
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,716
You see, this is not her fault.

50
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:10,006
I backed her into a corner and I don't want
to make this thing look antagonistic, so...

51
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:12,043
OK, so lose this?

52
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:16,643
Well, skip ahead to after the apology.

53
00:04:17,487 --> 00:04:20,285
There. That's it.

54
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:25,122
One day this secret will come
out. How do you think people will react?

55
00:04:25,207 --> 00:04:29,246
- Much better way of asking the question.
- I honestly don't know.

56
00:04:29,327 --> 00:04:35,402
I hope they can appreciate everything
we've been through. What it all means.

57
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:40,436
I hope that they will understand why the
people in charge chose to keep it a secret.

58
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:43,883
Is it difficult
to keep the secret?

59
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:49,166
Yeah. Of all the things I do around here,
in many ways that is the hardest.

60
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:55,322
Sometimes you look at what's going on
here on Earth and it makes you scream.

61
00:04:55,407 --> 00:04:58,558
You want to tell people
it is all so much bigger.

62
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:03,801
Stop it right there and go right to
Dr Jackson saying "Whether I was right..."

63
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:06,765
And you're gonna put me
into the Carter interview.

64
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:12,080
Especially the line "Is it difficult
to keep the secret?" All right. Move on.

65
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:15,796
Whether I was right
doesn't matter, given the truth.

66
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:18,606
- Truth matters to you?
- To everyone, I hope.

67
00:05:18,687 --> 00:05:24,125
What truth? For the people here on Earth?
Or are we talking about another planet?

68
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:27,324
People on other planets
are no less human.

69
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:32,037
People who've had their freedom usurped.
People forced to worship false gods.

70
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:35,756
But what about people here on Earth?
Are they entitled to the truth?

71
00:05:35,847 --> 00:05:39,920
- Is that what this is about?
- This? I'm not in control of when this airs.

72
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:42,646
Do you think this should get out?
If it were up to you.

73
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:45,002
Right there. Cut together.

74
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,078
Well, that's a complicated issue.

75
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm asking you. Do you think people on
Earth should know about this right now?

76
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:57,800
- What do you think would happen?
- People don't care much what I think.

77
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,436
Cut that line. Nobody cares that
nobody cares what I think. Lose it.

78
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,246
- OK. It's gone.
- Moving on.

79
00:06:04,327 --> 00:06:08,206
I haven't done what you've done.
I think people care what you think.

80
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:13,759
Well, I think it's a relative question.
And it depends on your point of view.

81
00:06:14,647 --> 00:06:17,161
No, stop it. This is just terrible.

82
00:06:17,247 --> 00:06:21,320
Really? I think it's pretty interesting stuff.
You did a good job of...

83
00:06:21,407 --> 00:06:22,920
Yak, yak, yak, yak.

84
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:27,205
- A bunch of talking heads is what it is.
- I could watch Major Carter talk all day.

85
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:31,200
We need images to tell this story.
What these people are doing, good or bad,

86
00:06:31,287 --> 00:06:34,996
makes the lunar landing look like
we were testing our toes in the ocean.

87
00:06:35,087 --> 00:06:38,762
And what have we got to show for it?
Yak yak yak. Nothing.

88
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,157
Where's the equivalent shot of Shepherd
golfing on the moon?

89
00:06:42,247 --> 00:06:45,125
We don't have it.
This is unbelievably boring.

90
00:07:03,887 --> 00:07:08,517
- Hi, Jack. Thanks for coming.
- I was told you said there were six Jaffa.

91
00:07:08,607 --> 00:07:11,167
Where'd you learn to count?

92
00:07:26,087 --> 00:07:31,957
Ships didn't start coming down till
you radioed you were through the gate.

93
00:07:36,287 --> 00:07:41,520
Something tells me they're throwing
this party in your honour. Got those clips?

94
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:44,280
Our position is being compromised.

95
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:47,086
We're not gonna be able
to hold the gate for long.

96
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:50,876
It doesn't matter. We're not gonna be
able to hold this position for long.

97
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:54,960
I need more time to stabilise
this patient. He can't be moved yet.

98
00:07:55,047 --> 00:07:58,084
Sir! We gotta fall back!

99
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:13,161
Sir!

100
00:08:36,647 --> 00:08:40,686
That's 50 calibre, right? You can get
really shaken up with that thing.

101
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:43,156
- Our guys are trained...
- I'm kidding.

102
00:08:43,247 --> 00:08:46,603
What is this? Get a shot of this.
Can you explain how this operates?

103
00:08:46,687 --> 00:08:48,723
Uh, sure.

104
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:53,927
Our guys like to play a little Space
Invaders when there's not much going on.

105
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:58,205
- Ha ha. Very funny.
- No, obviously I'm kidding.

106
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:02,724
It would be completely inappropriate for
any airman to play video games on duty.

107
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,685
Can we move on?
What's that on the wall here?

108
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:09,077
- Here is the manual override for the Iris.
- Are you kidding now?

109
00:09:09,167 --> 00:09:13,240
- No, I'm serious. Incoming wormhole!
- We're gonna have to leave now.

110
00:09:13,327 --> 00:09:15,363
- No, keep shooting!
- I can't do that.

111
00:09:15,447 --> 00:09:18,280
- I can do it.
- Remove that camera crew/

112
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,164
Now/

113
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:26,636
We are under fire and have
serious casualties. Coming in hot.

114
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:29,844
Receiving SG-1's Iris code, sir.

115
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:32,202
Open the Iris.

116
00:09:32,287 --> 00:09:36,075
- This way, sir.
- Medical team to the gate room.

117
00:09:39,167 --> 00:09:41,761
We have to clear this area.

118
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:54,603
Sorry about that.
Here, take the damn thing.

119
00:09:59,327 --> 00:10:02,842
In future, sir, could you leave
the camera work to me?

120
00:10:03,807 --> 00:10:06,367
I'll leave it to you.
Here she comes. Let's go.

121
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:10,998
Don't look at him, we're cleared to shoot
here. Just follow me. Bring the sound!

122
00:10:11,087 --> 00:10:13,157
- Major! What happened?
- Please.

123
00:10:13,247 --> 00:10:16,557
I know at least one person was injured.
All I want to say is...

124
00:10:16,647 --> 00:10:20,720
Look, leave me alone.
And shut that damn thing off!

125
00:10:20,807 --> 00:10:23,879
No, I just want to say how sorry I am...

126
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:32,798
Why is that camera off? You don't know
what you're doing here, maybe I do.

127
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:35,082
These people risk their lives for us.

128
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:38,876
I want to see what they go through,
even if they don't want us to.

129
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,083
And I want other people to see it.

130
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:45,399
What do you think they're doing out
there? Protecting and defending secrecy?

131
00:10:45,487 --> 00:10:47,876
That's the world of Mao, of Stalin.

132
00:10:47,967 --> 00:10:53,246
The world of secret police,
secret trials, secret deaths.

133
00:10:55,087 --> 00:11:00,559
You force the press into the cold
and all you will get is lies and innuendo.

134
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:03,844
And nothing is worse for a free society

135
00:11:03,927 --> 00:11:09,001
than a press that is in service
to the military and the politicians.

136
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:10,884
Nothing!

137
00:11:11,727 --> 00:11:16,198
You turn that camera off
when I tell you to turn it off!

138
00:11:17,247 --> 00:11:20,603
You think I give a damn
what you think about me?

139
00:11:20,687 --> 00:11:23,679
You serve the people. So do I.

140
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,756
Hey, how you doing?

141
00:11:43,847 --> 00:11:48,045
I don't suppose you know anything
about what's going on here?

142
00:11:48,127 --> 00:11:51,597
There are multiple injuries.
At least two people were hit.

143
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,884
There was a firefight.
One of the teams got ambushed

144
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:58,516
so they sent in SG-1, SG-5,
Fraiser and the medical team.

145
00:11:58,607 --> 00:12:01,326
Someone from the original team
must be badly hurt.

146
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,763
- A nurse said there was a casualty.
- Someone die?

147
00:12:04,847 --> 00:12:08,726
- She wouldn't say who.
- Carter wouldn't be crying unless...

148
00:12:08,807 --> 00:12:12,277
We hear somebody actually
may have died. What have you got?

149
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:13,595
O'Neill.

150
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:18,155
- You sure?
- No, I heard O'Neill's on a gurney.

151
00:12:18,247 --> 00:12:21,557
He took a blast. He's not moving.

152
00:12:30,647 --> 00:12:32,763
General Hammond. Mr Woolsey.

153
00:12:32,847 --> 00:12:34,644
General.

154
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:43,317
I know these orders came from Kinsey's
office. Why don't you tell me the rest?

155
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,637
As chairman of the Oversight Committee,

156
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:51,085
Kinsey asked that I review your decision
regarding the attempted rescue of SG-13.

157
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:54,842
- "Attempted"?
- There were several casualties, sir.

158
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:56,645
I'd hardly call it a success.

159
00:12:56,727 --> 00:13:01,721
My decisions are reviewed by the Air
Force Chief of Staff and the president.

160
00:13:01,807 --> 00:13:05,516
As of yet I haven't even filed
a preliminary mission report.

161
00:13:05,607 --> 00:13:08,246
When I do, you're welcome to read it.

162
00:13:08,327 --> 00:13:11,444
I have been authorized to begin
a full investigation,

163
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:16,760
as part of a larger examination of SGC's
strategic policy that we are preparing.

164
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:22,680
I've enclosed a list of interviews I will be
conducting, and materials I will require.

165
00:13:22,767 --> 00:13:24,917
We expect your full cooperation.

166
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:29,678
General.

167
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:37,442
How are you holding up?

168
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:42,201
- I'm OK, sir.
- Did you talk to Agent Barrett?

169
00:13:42,287 --> 00:13:46,565
He said as far as he knows, Woolsey
is clean. But he's sharp as they come.

170
00:13:46,647 --> 00:13:49,445
He's got an MBA and an LLB
from Harvard.

171
00:13:49,527 --> 00:13:54,647
He was lead counsel for the Corps of
Engineers and sat on the defence board.

172
00:13:54,727 --> 00:13:59,437
He resigned when it was disclosed that
he had financial ties to a large corporation

173
00:13:59,527 --> 00:14:04,476
that had been awarded over $800 million
in defence contracts by the Pentagon.

174
00:14:04,567 --> 00:14:06,558
He's been with the NID since then.

175
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:10,117
Barrett faxed me this internal NID memo
Woolsey recently wrote.

176
00:14:10,207 --> 00:14:13,085
I think you should read it.

177
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,045
What do we do, sir?

178
00:14:17,127 --> 00:14:19,960
- Just tell the truth.
- Yes, sir.

179
00:14:21,007 --> 00:14:24,716
There's going to be
a memorial service on Wednesday.

180
00:14:24,807 --> 00:14:28,800
I think it would be appropriate
if you said a few words.

181
00:14:28,887 --> 00:14:30,605
Yes, sir.

182
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:32,325
Sir?

183
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,596
How are you holding up?

184
00:14:41,007 --> 00:14:43,601
You try to tell yourself that...

185
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:49,357
every man and woman under your
command means the same to you.

186
00:14:50,287 --> 00:14:54,917
Each has to be equally valuable if
you're gonna make the kinds of decisions

187
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:58,556
that affect their lives the way I have to.

188
00:14:59,727 --> 00:15:02,605
But you can't help it.

189
00:15:02,687 --> 00:15:06,077
You get closer to some people.

190
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:09,045
You never want to lose anyone.

191
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:25,646
Have a seat, Major.
Let me explain why I'm here.

192
00:15:25,727 --> 00:15:28,116
I know why you're here.

193
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:34,396
I believe classified military operations
require oversight.

194
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,723
This isn't the first time we've been
scrutinised by the NID.

195
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,685
I know the stakes around here
are always high,

196
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:44,361
but there were
serious casualties this time.

197
00:15:44,447 --> 00:15:47,041
Someone of great value
to this programme is dead.

198
00:15:47,127 --> 00:15:52,326
I know that. And don't you dare
think anyone is taking it lightly.

199
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:55,642
You're a seasoned combat officer.

200
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:58,844
This isn't the first time
you've lost a close colleague.

201
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:01,839
Nor do I expect it will be the last.

202
00:16:02,927 --> 00:16:07,762
I just want to make sure
that it wasn't avoidable in this case.

203
00:16:07,847 --> 00:16:13,160
Despite what you might think,
the only reason I'm here is to get the truth.

204
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:15,636
Did you have a question?

205
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:20,446
Oh, yes. A few.

206
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:25,476
What made you think it was safe
for SG-13 to remain on the planet?

207
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,603
That's not really my call.

208
00:16:27,687 --> 00:16:31,475
But you thought it was worth risking
the lives of an SG team

209
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:35,116
to get an aerial survey of these ruins.

210
00:16:35,207 --> 00:16:38,597
The device was damaged.
It took a while to get an interface.

211
00:16:38,687 --> 00:16:41,679
The memory contained
an enormous amount of information.

212
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:46,045
So you would have me believe
that this was an acceptable risk?

213
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:51,038
- This is what we do.
- Make bad decisions.

214
00:16:51,127 --> 00:16:53,800
It's easy to predict the score
when the game's over.

215
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:58,961
And if we'd found weapons in those ruins
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

216
00:16:59,047 --> 00:17:02,005
But you didn't. And we are.

217
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:09,565
If there had been weapons in those ruins,
they would be in the hands of the Goa'uld.

218
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:13,526
The fact is, this mission was botched
from the beginning to the end.

219
00:17:13,607 --> 00:17:15,916
We don't just leave people behind.

220
00:17:16,007 --> 00:17:21,001
You can't ask airmen, soldiers, human
beings, to risk their lives without backup.

221
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:23,078
Without knowing we would be there.

222
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:27,683
You have been asked to go into combat
where you knew there was no backup.

223
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:32,204
That is always a possibility
on any mission through the Stargate.

224
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:35,404
And, please, Major.
None of us likes to admit it,

225
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:41,801
but there are situations in which the life
of one human being is an acceptable loss.

226
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:43,798
That wasn't the case here.

227
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:48,881
No, in this case it was just dumb luck
that there weren't many more lives lost.

228
00:17:48,967 --> 00:17:52,084
I would say it was skill,
training and fortitude.

229
00:17:52,167 --> 00:17:54,442
Based on your expertise
in Goa'uld tactics,

230
00:17:54,527 --> 00:17:59,123
was it not reasonable to conclude
that this was an ambush?

231
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:06,926
While you are not one of our military
and not eligible for court-martial,

232
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:12,081
I shouldn't have to remind you
that you are expected to follow orders.

233
00:18:12,167 --> 00:18:15,000
As I was doing on the day in question.

234
00:18:15,087 --> 00:18:17,885
If you fail to testify here today,

235
00:18:17,967 --> 00:18:22,165
I will have you jailed
until such time that you do.

236
00:18:23,847 --> 00:18:28,204
You fire me, you throw me in jail.
You do what you want.

237
00:18:44,247 --> 00:18:47,637
- Dr Jackson.
- Yeah, it's not a good time right now.

238
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:50,321
I've heard bits and pieces
of what happened.

239
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:53,524
I was hoping you might
be able to confirm some of it.

240
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:55,120
Sorry.

241
00:19:04,647 --> 00:19:06,638
Did you...?

242
00:19:11,847 --> 00:19:15,806
You're gonna be all right, Simon.
You'll be home before you know it.

243
00:19:15,887 --> 00:19:18,765
Over here!
Man down over here!

244
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,404
There's a lot of blood
coming from underneath him.

245
00:19:23,487 --> 00:19:26,047
I'll cover you up on this ridge.

246
00:19:26,127 --> 00:19:29,358
- I'm Dr Janet Fraiser. Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

247
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:33,838
I'm shot bad. I can't move. I can't feel
my leg. I think it went right through me.

248
00:19:33,927 --> 00:19:39,081
- What's your name?
- Senior Airman Wells. Am I gonna die?

249
00:19:39,167 --> 00:19:44,082
Not if I have anything to do with it. We
need to roll him over, stop the bleeding.

250
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:48,126
Simon, you hang in there.
OK. Easy.

251
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:52,117
All right, on three.
One, two, three.

252
00:20:00,647 --> 00:20:04,003
- I'm Daniel Jackson.
- I know. I know. SG-1.

253
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:06,317
- You're gonna be fine.
- Son of a bitch.

254
00:20:06,407 --> 00:20:08,398
Came out of nowhere.
Shot me in the back.

255
00:20:08,487 --> 00:20:13,038
Let's talk about something else.
What's going on at home?

256
00:20:13,127 --> 00:20:17,678
- My wife is pregnant.
- Yeah? That your first?

257
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:19,564
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

258
00:20:21,927 --> 00:20:24,202
That's good. At least you felt that.

259
00:20:24,287 --> 00:20:29,486
Our position's being compromised.
We're not gonna be able to hold the gate.

260
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,286
We're not gonna hold
this position for long.

261
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:35,006
I need more time to stabilise this patient.

262
00:20:35,087 --> 00:20:37,885
- He can't be moved yet.
- Go without me. Leave me.

263
00:20:37,967 --> 00:20:42,802
- Nobody is going anywhere.
- I can't believe I'm not gonna see my son.

264
00:20:42,887 --> 00:20:46,323
Stay focused. You know this is a boy
you're gonna have, right?

265
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:49,604
Tell me the truth.
I'm not gonna make it, right?

266
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:52,326
- You're gonna be fine.
- Dr Jackson.

267
00:20:52,407 --> 00:20:56,878
Please, please just let me tell my wife,
let me tell my wife that...

268
00:20:59,607 --> 00:21:02,075
OK. OK.

269
00:21:04,007 --> 00:21:05,804
Got it.

270
00:21:06,927 --> 00:21:09,316
Just breathe, Simon.

271
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:18,682
I said now's not a good time. What part
about that didn't you understand?

272
00:21:20,047 --> 00:21:25,280
- You got something on tape, didn't you?
- Get out. Get out.

273
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,959
OK.

274
00:21:27,847 --> 00:21:29,883
I'm going. All right.

275
00:21:39,807 --> 00:21:41,684
You know, I, uh...

276
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:46,522
I once did a piece on a war photographer.
His name is Martin Krystovski.

277
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:49,883
For about six months
he was with a unit in Vietnam.

278
00:21:49,967 --> 00:21:52,845
The day before
he was scheduled to leave -

279
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:56,158
the day before -
he's out with the unit.

280
00:21:57,687 --> 00:22:01,805
And it was just a routine patrol,
or so they thought.

281
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:06,597
But suddenly,
the lieutenant pulled him down.

282
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,765
And Krystovski hadn't intended
to take a picture,

283
00:22:11,847 --> 00:22:16,841
but his hands were on the camera
and he hit the ground so hard it went off.

284
00:22:16,927 --> 00:22:19,316
And the picture captured...

285
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:22,363
the lieutenant...

286
00:22:22,447 --> 00:22:27,123
getting... shot... in the head.

287
00:22:28,487 --> 00:22:34,357
And Krystovski said to me "That bullet
would have - should have - hit me."

288
00:22:34,447 --> 00:22:39,475
And he never showed that picture
to anyone. Not for 25 years.

289
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:47,486
But 25 years later, he got up one morning
and he looked at that picture.

290
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,764
And he saw something...

291
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:55,363
that... wasn't... horrific.

292
00:22:55,447 --> 00:23:00,680
And he decided to tell the story,
because he realised

293
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:06,524
that he hadn't accidentally
taken a picture of a man dying.

294
00:23:06,607 --> 00:23:08,962
It was of a man...

295
00:23:09,047 --> 00:23:11,515
saving his life.

296
00:23:12,687 --> 00:23:16,521
The picture... I'm making,

297
00:23:16,607 --> 00:23:18,518
that I'm trying to make,

298
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:22,122
is about what you people do
every single day,

299
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:25,677
in extreme circumstances
that no one can even imagine.

300
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:30,204
And I don't know what happened out
there. I'm sorry about it, whatever it was.

301
00:23:30,287 --> 00:23:36,556
And if you did tape something of it,
that's not gonna change what happened.

302
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:40,242
What will change is how you feel about it.

303
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:04,278
General.

304
00:24:05,287 --> 00:24:08,279
I've prepared a written testimony.

305
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:17,363
- This is your mission report.
- I thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.

306
00:24:18,367 --> 00:24:22,724
- Well, then. I guess I'm done.
- Then you'll be leaving.

307
00:24:22,807 --> 00:24:26,117
The president will have my report
by the end of the week.

308
00:24:26,207 --> 00:24:32,203
I'm sure it'll be every bit as interesting as
your memo on the economics of the SGC.

309
00:24:34,407 --> 00:24:36,398
I won't bother asking how you got that.

310
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:40,878
What was the dollar value
you attributed to an SG team member?

311
00:24:40,967 --> 00:24:44,198
You know damn well I wasn't
pegging the value of a life.

312
00:24:44,287 --> 00:24:49,486
It is a cold, hard fact that it costs millions
of dollars to train these men and women.

313
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:54,277
And that is a fraction of the funds
being subverted by the Pentagon for this.

314
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:59,680
It is reprehensible that the taxpayers
of this country are paying enormous sums

315
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:05,444
to wage a war they know nothing about,
and are getting little, if anything, in return.

316
00:25:05,527 --> 00:25:10,647
If the Stargate were public knowledge,
and your actions were judged in public...

317
00:25:10,727 --> 00:25:15,847
You're suggesting that sending a rescue
team worth $27 million to save one man

318
00:25:15,927 --> 00:25:17,804
is a bad business decision.

319
00:25:17,887 --> 00:25:21,243
- You're putting words in my mouth.
- You said it in black and white.

320
00:25:21,327 --> 00:25:25,764
And I don't think you would dare do that
if this wasn't a classified operation.

321
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:31,956
The president has asked a documentary
team to get to the truth of what's going on.

322
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:38,600
Why don't we just go down and give them
the whole truth, as you see it, right now?

323
00:25:47,967 --> 00:25:49,798
That memo is classified.

324
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:55,598
This investigation is classified. If you
so much as utter even a hint of either,

325
00:25:56,167 --> 00:26:02,322
I'll see you are put away in a cold,
dark place for the rest of time.

326
00:26:14,527 --> 00:26:16,324
- General.
- What is it, Colonel?

327
00:26:16,407 --> 00:26:21,845
Security caught Mr Bregman trying to
access the infirmary. Claims he was lost.

328
00:26:21,927 --> 00:26:26,079
- Get rid of him.
- Sir? Have our orders changed, sir?

329
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:29,159
Toss him out on his ass, Colonel.

330
00:26:35,287 --> 00:26:39,405
- What's this? What's going on?
- The general's ordered you off the base.

331
00:26:39,487 --> 00:26:41,717
- No, no, he can't do that.
- He is a general.

332
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:45,277
- Would you stop packing?
- Keep packing.

333
00:26:47,927 --> 00:26:50,919
You got one hour to get off my base
and outta my sight.

334
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:53,282
- Whose authority?
- My superiors.

335
00:26:53,367 --> 00:26:56,006
I just want to make a phone call.

336
00:26:56,087 --> 00:26:59,124
Call whoever you want.
There's a payphone at the surface.

337
00:26:59,207 --> 00:27:03,405
- Actually, I'd like to borrow your red one.
- You have some nerve.

338
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:05,921
That's what my mother used to say.

339
00:27:23,247 --> 00:27:26,523
I've been ordered to turn over the tape.

340
00:27:28,527 --> 00:27:31,963
Look, I'm not happy about it either.

341
00:27:32,047 --> 00:27:34,117
I could fight it.

342
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:38,200
The tape could get lost, or accidentally
erased. These things happen.

343
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:41,199
But I'm not going to do that.

344
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:44,438
I had that little weasel of a man
thrown out of here.

345
00:27:44,527 --> 00:27:46,643
But in light of the NID investigation,

346
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:51,278
I think there should be a record of what
goes on beyond the classified reports.

347
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:53,961
And you trust Bregman to portray that?

348
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,242
At the moment I have no other choice.

349
00:28:13,167 --> 00:28:14,725
Hey. Hey.

350
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:17,367
I got the tape. Put it on.

351
00:28:22,967 --> 00:28:26,755
- Mission file's been declassified.
- Just a minute.

352
00:28:26,847 --> 00:28:28,803
You tell her yourself.

353
00:28:28,887 --> 00:28:32,038
I'm so sorry about this.

354
00:28:32,647 --> 00:28:35,036
I love you so much.

355
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,805
I just wanted...

356
00:28:40,407 --> 00:28:45,481
God, shut it off! Shut it off!
I don't want her to see me die/

357
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,922
Simon/ Simon/ Look at me.

358
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,396
You are not going to die, OK?

359
00:28:50,487 --> 00:28:52,921
I did not come all the way out here
for nothing.

360
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:56,397
We've stemmed the bleeding.
We're gonna get you on a stretcher.

361
00:28:56,487 --> 00:28:59,081
We're gonna get you home
in no time, OK?

362
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:02,477
- Now you hang in there, Airman.
- Yes, ma'am.

363
00:29:02,567 --> 00:29:05,479
God/ What happened? Is she hit?

364
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:10,282
I got him.
You're clear, Dr Jackson.

365
00:29:10,367 --> 00:29:13,040
I need a medic/

366
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:16,199
- Fraiser's hit/ I need a medic/
- Is she OK?

367
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:21,077
Sierra Golf niner.
Dr Fraiser's been hit. Position...

368
00:29:21,167 --> 00:29:23,362
I need a medic/

369
00:29:25,407 --> 00:29:28,479
O'Neill's alive. So is Airman Wells.

370
00:29:29,767 --> 00:29:32,361
Dr Fraiser didn't make it.

371
00:29:51,367 --> 00:29:53,198
Sir.

372
00:29:53,287 --> 00:29:55,926
We heard you were up and around.

373
00:29:56,007 --> 00:29:57,486
Yeah.

374
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:02,326
Still a little tender,
but they said I could go home.

375
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:08,805
You're lucky that staff blast hit you where
it did. That new vest insert works well.

376
00:30:08,887 --> 00:30:11,879
Didn't help Fraiser much.

377
00:30:11,967 --> 00:30:14,117
No.

378
00:30:16,967 --> 00:30:19,037
How's Cassie?

379
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:22,358
She's a strong kid.
She survives, you know?

380
00:30:22,447 --> 00:30:24,039
Yeah.

381
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:28,286
You speaking at the memorial?

382
00:30:30,527 --> 00:30:33,325
Sir, I just wanted to say...

383
00:30:35,447 --> 00:30:38,166
When you were lying there, I...

384
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,196
I'm really glad you're OK.

385
00:31:04,647 --> 00:31:06,638
Come here.

386
00:31:31,407 --> 00:31:35,639
- Dr Jackson.
- Hey. Please, just call me Daniel.

387
00:31:36,887 --> 00:31:39,685
So I hear you're gonna
make a full recovery.

388
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,564
So they say.

389
00:31:41,647 --> 00:31:43,763
- You talk to your wife?
- Yeah.

390
00:31:43,847 --> 00:31:46,680
- Everything's OK?
- Yeah.

391
00:31:47,487 --> 00:31:50,001
I never asked you when she was due.

392
00:31:50,087 --> 00:31:53,841
Couple of weeks.
They say I should be outta here by then.

393
00:31:53,927 --> 00:31:55,918
- That's great.
- Yeah.

394
00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:02,439
I just wanted
to see how you were doing, so...

395
00:32:03,607 --> 00:32:06,075
She's dead because of me.

396
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,125
No.

397
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:13,443
No, she's dead because a Jaffa shot her.

398
00:32:13,527 --> 00:32:19,636
She was doing her job. Same way you
were doing yours when a Jaffa shot you.

399
00:32:19,727 --> 00:32:22,366
- I can't make it feel right.
- It wasn't right.

400
00:32:22,447 --> 00:32:25,166
Nothing about it was right.

401
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,678
But it also wasn't your fault.

402
00:33:02,927 --> 00:33:04,918
Hey, Teal'c.

403
00:33:07,567 --> 00:33:10,957
General Hammond asked me to speak
at the memorial service.

404
00:33:11,047 --> 00:33:13,038
I am aware.

405
00:33:14,447 --> 00:33:17,803
I don't know what to say.
Nothing seems good enough.

406
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:21,880
I believe you should only speak
from your heart.

407
00:33:24,807 --> 00:33:27,196
I gotta go pick up Cassie.

408
00:33:28,087 --> 00:33:30,078
Major Carter.

409
00:33:32,087 --> 00:33:35,397
I have pondered what I would say
were I given the chance.

410
00:33:35,487 --> 00:33:37,284
Really?

411
00:33:39,087 --> 00:33:43,080
But I believe it would be best
if it came from you.

412
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:14,564
- Over here.
- Oh.

413
00:34:15,727 --> 00:34:17,922
I was told you might be here, Dr Jackson.

414
00:34:18,007 --> 00:34:19,804
Yeah.

415
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:23,476
I just, uh...

416
00:34:24,327 --> 00:34:27,399
came by to give this back to you.

417
00:34:28,807 --> 00:34:31,367
I'm not gonna use it.

418
00:34:35,687 --> 00:34:37,564
Wait.

419
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:41,885
I want you to.

420
00:34:48,647 --> 00:34:51,764
You know, I died in this room.

421
00:34:51,847 --> 00:34:53,644
Ascended.

422
00:34:55,247 --> 00:34:57,522
Dr Fraiser did everything she could.

423
00:34:57,607 --> 00:35:01,077
She went three days without sleep.

424
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:04,762
Even in the end,
she didn't want to let me go.

425
00:35:09,887 --> 00:35:14,756
I owed her...
a lot more than I ever gave back.

426
00:35:17,447 --> 00:35:21,838
I thought a lot about what you said
about Krystovski.

427
00:35:23,807 --> 00:35:28,039
I think this shows
what Janet Fraiser was all about.

428
00:35:28,127 --> 00:35:30,038
Me too.

429
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:33,164
I want other people to know.

430
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:49,276
Janet Fraiser
was an extraordinary person.

431
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:54,558
She was kind, and funny, and talented.

432
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:58,285
Above all, she was courageous.

433
00:36:59,687 --> 00:37:03,885
Try as I might,
I could not find the words to honour her.

434
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:06,356
To do justice to her life.

435
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:09,835
Thankfully I got some help.

436
00:37:13,687 --> 00:37:19,159
While words alone may not be enough,
there are some names that might do.

437
00:37:20,247 --> 00:37:25,002
We often talk about those that give
their lives in the service of their country.

438
00:37:25,087 --> 00:37:30,878
And while Janet Fraiser did just that,
that's not what her life was about.

439
00:37:31,687 --> 00:37:36,920
The following are the names of the men
and women who did not die in service,

440
00:37:37,007 --> 00:37:41,398
but who are in fact alive today
because of Janet.

441
00:37:43,767 --> 00:37:45,758
Major Samantha Carter.

442
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:48,956
Dr Daniel Jackson.

443
00:37:49,047 --> 00:37:51,322
Colonel Jack O'Neill.

444
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:52,886
Teal'c.

445
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:55,401
Sergeant Connie Smith.

446
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:57,637
Major Ian Hules.

447
00:37:57,727 --> 00:38:00,400
Senior Airman Simon Wells.

448
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:04,116
Our armed forces
have turned the tide of world wars.

449
00:38:04,207 --> 00:38:10,077
Young men and women from our country
have humbled history's worst tyrants.

450
00:38:10,167 --> 00:38:14,638
We carve our thanks in stone.
We stamp it into medals.

451
00:38:14,727 --> 00:38:21,644
We carefully tend vast fields where those
who gave their lives for our freedom lay.

452
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:28,599
More than ever, we cannot fail to pass
stories of courage to the next generation.

453
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:33,841
We must capture their imaginations, while
paying tribute to all those willing to die

454
00:38:33,927 --> 00:38:37,840
for the preservation of our way of life.

455
00:38:39,847 --> 00:38:43,601
It's a shame no one's ever going to see it.

456
00:38:43,687 --> 00:38:45,166
Really?

457
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:48,000
You, uh...

458
00:38:48,087 --> 00:38:50,521
You don't think it's a little sentimental?

459
00:38:50,607 --> 00:38:52,996
No. It's good.

460
00:38:53,087 --> 00:38:55,237
Well, that's a relief.

461
00:38:56,727 --> 00:38:59,799
Hearing that from you, of all people.

462
00:38:59,887 --> 00:39:05,359
Especially given how you felt about what
I was doing. I understood how you felt...

463
00:39:06,527 --> 00:39:11,681
I'm a big enough man to admit when
I'm wrong. I'm glad you stuck with it.

464
00:39:13,327 --> 00:39:16,285
That means a lot to me, sir.

465
00:39:17,647 --> 00:39:21,765
I've written a lot of letters
to the next of kin.

466
00:39:23,287 --> 00:39:27,405
Nothing ever seems like it's enough.
They deserve more.

467
00:39:28,327 --> 00:39:31,125
This is something more.

468
00:39:32,567 --> 00:39:34,558
Thank you, sir.

469
00:39:40,527 --> 00:39:46,238
There is one thing, General, that's still
missing that could make a difference.

470
00:39:47,647 --> 00:39:49,956
I'll take care of it.

471
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:05,999
Hey.

472
00:40:06,927 --> 00:40:09,043
Come in, come in.

473
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:15,803
Daniel, this is my wife, Marci.

474
00:40:15,887 --> 00:40:19,243
Hi. I'd love to give you a hug, but...

475
00:40:19,327 --> 00:40:21,921
Please, don't get up.

476
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:24,202
This is my daughter.

477
00:40:24,287 --> 00:40:27,165
- She is beautiful.
- Thanks.

478
00:40:28,407 --> 00:40:32,286
- I guess that ultrasound was wrong, huh?
- Yeah.

479
00:40:32,367 --> 00:40:35,165
What's her name?

480
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:37,764
Janet.

481
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:42,556
That's nice.

482
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:00,237
OK, guys... Tom.

483
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:02,477
Emmett.

484
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:03,920
- You ready?
- Rolling.

485
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:05,565
Sound?

486
00:41:05,647 --> 00:41:08,559
OK. First question.

487
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:11,279
OK.

488
