1
00:00:15,487 --> 00:00:17,603
Um...

2
00:00:26,647 --> 00:00:28,638
Ow.

3
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:34,445
- What?
- Jack.

4
00:00:34,527 --> 00:00:38,566
I've translated the writing on the
colonnade SG-2 discovered on P3X-439.

5
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:40,205
I'll be there in half an hour.

6
00:00:40,287 --> 00:00:43,245
It talks about
a library of knowledge, Jack.

7
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:46,444
I think the monument contains
a repository of the Ancients.

8
00:00:46,527 --> 00:00:47,880
Repository?

9
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:51,357
That thing that grabbed your head,
made you talk crazy.

10
00:00:51,447 --> 00:00:54,723
Sounds like we should stay away, then.

11
00:00:54,807 --> 00:00:58,356
We should be able to find
another way to access the information.

12
00:00:58,447 --> 00:01:03,840
Sam's used Tok'ra crystals to find a way
to transfer all kinds of different energy.

13
00:01:07,047 --> 00:01:09,163
...we should go there as soon as possible.

14
00:01:09,247 --> 00:01:11,681
- Yeah?
- So?

15
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,565
- I'll be there in half an hour.
- OK. Bye.

16
00:01:14,647 --> 00:01:18,845
No, no, no, wait. Don't hang up.
I need a seven-letter word.

17
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:24,522
- I told Sam I wouldn't help you.
- This'll be one thing she doesn't know.

18
00:01:24,607 --> 00:01:27,997
"Up, down, charmed, blank."

19
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,839
Strange.

20
00:01:30,767 --> 00:01:33,327
Yeah. Well, thanks anyway.

21
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:36,001
No, the word you're looking for...

22
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:47,479
I know, I know.
I couldn't get her off the phone.

23
00:01:47,567 --> 00:01:49,842
I should be done by noon.

24
00:01:49,927 --> 00:01:53,044
Whatever it is,
I'm sure it won't take long to say no.

25
00:01:53,127 --> 00:01:55,846
I'll be at Georgetown
at two for my Poli-Sci class,

26
00:01:55,927 --> 00:02:00,000
and I'm speaking at the
Women in Washington dinner at seven.

27
00:02:00,087 --> 00:02:04,717
I'll call you back. This guy's gonna steal
my cab. I called for a taxi ten minutes ago.

28
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:11,605
As do I.

29
00:02:11,687 --> 00:02:14,155
I cannot be late.
I'm going to the White House.

30
00:02:14,247 --> 00:02:17,523
I have to be there in 15 minutes.
I'm meeting with the president.

31
00:02:17,607 --> 00:02:22,522
- Of the United States. Really, I am.
- Hey. One of you gonna get in or what?

32
00:02:22,607 --> 00:02:25,838
Wait! Can I offer you a cab fare,
wherever you need to go?

33
00:02:25,927 --> 00:02:30,364
- Can you call this man another taxi?
- Excuse me, Dr Weir.

34
00:02:30,447 --> 00:02:34,122
- Please get in, ma'am.
- Uh...

35
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:45,078
Mr Vice President.

36
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:47,158
Dr Weir.

37
00:03:52,767 --> 00:03:55,327
It wasn't necessary
for you to pick me up, sir.

38
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:58,365
I was on my way from the athletic club.

39
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:03,885
Besides, there are very few people who
could properly brief you for this interview.

40
00:04:04,367 --> 00:04:07,006
Uh, interview?
I agreed to have just a meeting...

41
00:04:07,087 --> 00:04:10,966
How would you respond if I told you
the Air Force is currently conducting

42
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:16,963
top-secret operations with an alien
transportation device called the Stargate?

43
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:22,440
It was discovered in the early 1900s at
Giza, not too far from the Great Pyramids.

44
00:04:24,207 --> 00:04:26,596
Is this a joke?

45
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:33,202
- What is it?
- A note from the president.

46
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:39,246
And you might wanna read this, too.

47
00:04:46,607 --> 00:04:48,518
Oh, my God.

48
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:10,359
- How long have you been waiting?
- You said half an hour.

49
00:05:10,447 --> 00:05:12,836
General Hammond's waiting.

50
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,800
Excuse me.

51
00:05:17,887 --> 00:05:21,482
The fate of the world is in the balance
and you've been finishing this?

52
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,240
I believe it was double or nothing.

53
00:05:24,327 --> 00:05:29,276
OK. 23 across. "The atomic weight
of boron." The answer is ten.

54
00:05:29,407 --> 00:05:31,796
- Yes.
- You wrote the word "fat".

55
00:05:31,887 --> 00:05:34,162
Your point?

56
00:05:37,887 --> 00:05:40,276
Should be out of here.

57
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,879
Harper. Reynolds.

58
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:44,958
- Sir.
- Jack.

59
00:05:45,047 --> 00:05:49,359
SG-3 spotted a Goa'uld reconnaissance
drone where they found the colonnade.

60
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:52,086
Since that means
the Goa'uld were aware of it,

61
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:54,920
SGs 3 and 5 will be providing backup.

62
00:05:55,007 --> 00:05:58,124
If General Hammond
approves the mission.

63
00:05:59,207 --> 00:06:03,280
- What mission?
- Good morning, SG-1.

64
00:06:03,367 --> 00:06:07,326
- Nice of you to join us.
- Good morning, sir.

65
00:06:10,447 --> 00:06:13,564
I've read Dr Jackson's report
on his translation.

66
00:06:13,647 --> 00:06:16,719
After the last time
you encountered something like this,

67
00:06:16,807 --> 00:06:19,924
I'm surprised you're so willing
to take on this mission.

68
00:06:20,007 --> 00:06:22,680
So am I, sir.

69
00:06:22,767 --> 00:06:24,837
Jack.

70
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,485
Daniel.

71
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:30,606
Why wouldn't we want to gain access
to the greatest repository of knowledge?

72
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,678
Find the Lost City of the Ancients,

73
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:38,683
and use their technology to save the
entire galaxy from the evil of the Goa'uld?

74
00:06:38,767 --> 00:06:40,758
Well, there's that.

75
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:45,238
From the mission file I've read,
this thing whips up from the wall,

76
00:06:45,327 --> 00:06:47,557
grabs your head and
rearranges your brain.

77
00:06:47,647 --> 00:06:49,444
- Sort of.
- Sort of?

78
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:53,964
It downloads the entire library of
Ancient knowledge into a person's mind.

79
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:57,164
That massive amount of data
then unspools into your brain,

80
00:06:57,247 --> 00:06:59,681
eventually taking over
your consciousness.

81
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:03,919
- But it wasn't meant for primitives like us.
- Easy, fella.

82
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:07,206
The report said
you almost died last time, sir.

83
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:13,078
The Asgard removed the information from
O'Neill's mind before he was lost to us.

84
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:17,080
So, why don't we just shoot Thor a call?
Get him standing by as backup.

85
00:07:17,167 --> 00:07:19,442
We tried, sir. He's not responding.

86
00:07:19,527 --> 00:07:24,237
None of our alien allies have been reliable
of late. Should something happen again...

87
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:26,795
No one should interface with the device.

88
00:07:26,887 --> 00:07:29,276
We're suggesting
it be brought home for study.

89
00:07:29,367 --> 00:07:33,280
The engineering team that studied
the last one of these devices you found

90
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,722
determined nothing
after months of research.

91
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:41,484
We believe that device's power source
was depleted when O'Neill activated it.

92
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,922
Recent intel suggests Anubis has become

93
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:48,603
a serious threat to dominate the rest
of the Goa'uld in a very short time.

94
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:52,157
We have to consider
Earth is at risk now more than ever.

95
00:07:52,247 --> 00:07:54,715
If the knowledge
contained within this device

96
00:07:54,807 --> 00:08:01,201
can lead us to technologies we can use
to defend ourselves, we must pursue it.

97
00:08:01,287 --> 00:08:04,996
- Why didn't you just say that?
- Sorry.

98
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:08,363
You have a go. And be careful, people.

99
00:08:16,007 --> 00:08:19,682
The file you read in the car
is just the beginning.

100
00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:24,682
You might want to familiarise yourself
with more of this before you take the job.

101
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:30,717
Take the job? I just found out
that science fiction isn't fiction.

102
00:08:30,807 --> 00:08:34,766
I mean, I've known there were secrets,
big secrets, but this is...

103
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:41,446
I don't know what's scarier - the fact that
this is all true or that you're telling me.

104
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:46,317
I can't imagine what kind of job you're
offering me, but I don't care any more.

105
00:08:46,407 --> 00:08:49,683
I realise you haven't met the president yet.

106
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:52,042
Just try and say no.

107
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:03,117
Chevron seven locked.

108
00:09:06,687 --> 00:09:11,238
SG teams 1, 3 and 5, good luck.
God speed.

109
00:09:11,327 --> 00:09:14,239
Thank you, sir. Let's move out.

110
00:09:37,647 --> 00:09:43,324
Reynolds. Set up a defence perimeter as
you see fit. Hold the gate till we get back.

111
00:09:43,407 --> 00:09:45,967
- You got it.
- Sir.

112
00:09:46,047 --> 00:09:48,436
SG-1, move out.

113
00:09:59,567 --> 00:10:03,446
You know,
we've searched this place, up and down.

114
00:10:03,527 --> 00:10:05,518
I know.

115
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,919
We could have Goa'uld
on our collective asses any minute now.

116
00:10:12,007 --> 00:10:13,998
I know.

117
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:20,645
According to the text
in this column, it's inside.

118
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:24,242
Inside, you say?

119
00:10:25,887 --> 00:10:29,004
Well, let me tell you, my friend,

120
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:31,760
there is no "inside".

121
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:36,805
There's just a whole lotta outside.

122
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:38,718
I know.

123
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:41,799
I'm getting some
strange readings from here.

124
00:10:41,887 --> 00:10:43,878
If I'm right...

125
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,758
Look out.

126
00:10:57,927 --> 00:11:00,805
- Reynolds, come in.
- Go ahead.

127
00:11:00,887 --> 00:11:05,358
- Yeah, we got something here. Stand by.
- All clear for the moment.

128
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:20,037
Now we just have to figure out
how to get this thing out of the wall.

129
00:11:24,927 --> 00:11:27,395
- Damn.
- Careful.

130
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:31,958
All right, one more time.
Why are we doing this? Why?

131
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:39,077
- You hear something, Harper?
- We got multiple bogeys, coming in fast.

132
00:11:39,167 --> 00:11:44,002
Dial the gate. Send constant radio signal.
We have to keep that door open.

133
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:48,080
SG-1, we have incoming.

134
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:04,240
- Let's go.
- We can't just leave.

135
00:12:04,327 --> 00:12:05,362
Daniel.

136
00:12:05,447 --> 00:12:10,123
We must not allow this device
to fall into the hands of Anubis.

137
00:12:11,127 --> 00:12:13,118
Fine.

138
00:12:14,647 --> 00:12:16,638
- Jack!
- He's right. If we destroy it,

139
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:20,436
we lose our only chance to find
the location of the Lost City.

140
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:22,882
O'Neill.

141
00:12:25,487 --> 00:12:27,284
Ah, crap.

142
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:31,361
All right, then what?

143
00:12:31,447 --> 00:12:34,120
No, no, no, no, no.

144
00:12:34,207 --> 00:12:38,280
Jack, somebody has to do it.
The answer is in there.

145
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:41,086
If we don't find the Lost City,
we're as good as dead.

146
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:45,240
And who does the translating
when you go Ancient?

147
00:12:56,487 --> 00:13:00,275
In fact, you're the one person
who can't do it.

148
00:13:02,087 --> 00:13:04,123
Jack!

149
00:13:04,207 --> 00:13:06,163
Sir!

150
00:13:15,007 --> 00:13:16,963
O'Neill.

151
00:13:21,007 --> 00:13:25,762
SG-1, where the hell are you guys?
We can't hold out for long.

152
00:13:26,807 --> 00:13:30,846
Colonel Reynolds,
we are headed back to the gate.

153
00:13:38,327 --> 00:13:41,763
Hold positions. Greaves, you're with me.

154
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,518
Take cover!

155
00:14:04,487 --> 00:14:07,559
Jack. Jack, you OK?

156
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:11,322
- What's going on?
- Come on. Let's get him up.

157
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:29,081
- Coming through the gate.
- We're behind you. Go!

158
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:38,445
- What happened?
- Didn't quite go according to plan.

159
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:42,566
- We have to get him to the infirmary.
- I did it again.

160
00:15:02,647 --> 00:15:04,638
Dr Weir.

161
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:08,756
Sorry to have kept you so late.

162
00:15:08,847 --> 00:15:12,601
That's all right.
I've been doing a little reading.

163
00:15:12,687 --> 00:15:15,997
Mr President, I mean,
this is truly so outrageous,

164
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:19,557
I feel compelled on behalf
of everyone who has no idea that...

165
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:24,596
Megan. Could you get
a car ready for Dr Weir?

166
00:15:24,687 --> 00:15:28,202
Five minutes. Thanks.

167
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:30,278
Sit down.

168
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:36,717
- Would you like something?
- No, thank you.

169
00:15:39,407 --> 00:15:43,036
Your reaction was very similar
to mine when I found out.

170
00:15:43,127 --> 00:15:45,322
I'm sorry. Five minutes, sir?

171
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:49,161
The negotiation
you mediated in North Africa?

172
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,045
Yes? What does that have to do with this?

173
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:58,844
Just that the Stargate probably
makes that seem like child's play.

174
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:03,239
Well, frankly, sir, I have absolutely
no idea what you want from me.

175
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:09,243
You brokered a dozen of the most
sensitive treaties in modern times,

176
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:11,363
speak God knows how many languages.

177
00:16:11,447 --> 00:16:13,597
Just five.

178
00:16:13,687 --> 00:16:16,155
Five.

179
00:16:17,247 --> 00:16:20,444
I suppose your aversion
to the military will be an issue.

180
00:16:20,527 --> 00:16:22,882
What are we talking about, exactly?

181
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:26,243
You running the Stargate programme.

182
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:28,839
Oh.

183
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:36,957
- How in the hell did this happen?
- It wasn't an accident.

184
00:16:37,047 --> 00:16:40,039
- He did it deliberately.
- To access the Ancients' knowledge.

185
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:44,006
He, uh... We figured
we'd never get another shot at it.

186
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:48,444
We know that the Ancient knowledge
will essentially overwrite his brain.

187
00:16:48,527 --> 00:16:52,315
We're hoping he'll become aware
of the information we're looking for.

188
00:16:52,407 --> 00:16:53,840
And then?

189
00:16:53,927 --> 00:16:57,044
Then it will overwhelm
his nervous system, and he will...

190
00:16:57,127 --> 00:17:00,676
What? Meet my maker? Pay the piper?

191
00:17:00,767 --> 00:17:06,000
Breach the pearly gates?
Start pushing up daisies here and there?

192
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:10,398
You should be in the infirmary.

193
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:14,765
Why? We all know
exactly what's gonna happen.

194
00:17:14,847 --> 00:17:17,759
In a few days,
I start speaking some strange language.

195
00:17:17,847 --> 00:17:21,362
Few days after that, I start
doing things beyond my control.

196
00:17:21,447 --> 00:17:27,397
And a few days after that, it's
"Good night, my someone, good night."

197
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:35,558
With your permission, I'd like to take
the weekend, get a few things together.

198
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:39,799
Last time, it took a couple of days
before we noticed a change in behaviour.

199
00:17:39,887 --> 00:17:43,004
I'll be back Monday, ready to work.

200
00:17:43,087 --> 00:17:46,204
- Permission granted.
- Thank you, sir.

201
00:17:47,207 --> 00:17:53,282
Now, if you'll excuse me, my favourite
television show starts in half an hour.

202
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:03,679
We've already done an initial review,

203
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:06,918
and we've decided
to suspend current operations

204
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:11,125
until a new government division
can be established.

205
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:13,767
The Stargate is a dangerous thing,

206
00:18:13,847 --> 00:18:18,398
but given what we know is going on
out there, it's something we can't ignore.

207
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:21,638
No, obviously not.

208
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,764
I don't want this
to sound terribly self-centred...

209
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:27,315
- Why you?
- Why me?

210
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,683
- What do you think?
- Well,

211
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:34,555
I'm betting other world leaders
are pressuring you for control.

212
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:38,401
- See? I knew you were a quick study.
- And I can advise you there.

213
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:42,082
But I am not qualified
to negotiate with aliens.

214
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:45,762
No one is, Doctor - not you, not me.

215
00:18:45,847 --> 00:18:48,805
But someone has to do it.

216
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:55,084
The fact is, we can't keep
this thing a secret forever.

217
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:59,206
And you wanna put a friendly face
on this thing when it goes public,

218
00:18:59,287 --> 00:19:01,801
someone less threatening
than a US general.

219
00:19:01,887 --> 00:19:04,037
People will panic.

220
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:08,484
It's going to take
anything and everything we have

221
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:12,446
to keep our civilisation
from turning upside down.

222
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:16,679
But, make no mistake, you're not just
a figurehead for the sake of publicity.

223
00:19:16,767 --> 00:19:20,077
I chose you for a damn good reason.

224
00:19:24,247 --> 00:19:29,367
- I take it my five minutes are up.
- Actually, it was seven.

225
00:19:29,447 --> 00:19:32,439
Don't worry, this is just the beginning.

226
00:19:38,287 --> 00:19:40,323
What if I say no, sir?

227
00:19:40,407 --> 00:19:43,001
Never going to happen.

228
00:19:45,567 --> 00:19:46,761
Bonnie!

229
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:51,841
Come on in here. Thank you.
Good seeing you again.

230
00:19:53,687 --> 00:19:57,805
So, things aren't
quite as simple as they seemed.

231
00:19:57,887 --> 00:20:00,082
It never seemed simple, sir.

232
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,635
Be careful who you trust, Doctor.

233
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:05,958
Does that include you, sir?

234
00:20:06,047 --> 00:20:11,041
He may be the president, but I am
the one person you want on your side.

235
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:15,803
And the one person
you don't wanna cross.

236
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,878
Hi, sir.

237
00:20:28,967 --> 00:20:31,401
Carter?

238
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:33,955
- Did I wake you?
- Sorta.

239
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:38,360
- I couldn't sleep last night.
- Should've called.

240
00:20:38,447 --> 00:20:41,120
I didn't want to bother you. I...

241
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:45,284
Um...

242
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:49,165
I was just looking at the sky.

243
00:20:49,247 --> 00:20:53,525
Trying to figure out
how many stars we'd actually been to.

244
00:20:53,607 --> 00:20:59,364
Actually, only a few of the stars visible
from Earth have Stargates on them, so...

245
00:20:59,447 --> 00:21:02,996
I knew that. Hammond send you by
to check up on me?

246
00:21:03,087 --> 00:21:05,396
No.

247
00:21:05,487 --> 00:21:07,921
It's funny, really. I, uh...

248
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:11,682
I was out driving, you know, in my car,

249
00:21:11,767 --> 00:21:15,362
and I, um... I drove here.

250
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:23,524
- Funny.
- Yeah.

251
00:21:23,607 --> 00:21:26,679
There's coffee around here. I think.

252
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:36,522
Maybe not. How about a beer?

253
00:21:36,607 --> 00:21:38,802
Sure. Why not?

254
00:21:56,407 --> 00:22:01,117
- Want a glass? I can wash one.
- No, I'm fine. Thank you, sir.

255
00:22:02,567 --> 00:22:05,604
Sir, do you ever talk to her?

256
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:07,882
Can we not talk about that?

257
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:10,276
Sorry.

258
00:22:10,367 --> 00:22:14,883
- How you feeling?
- Can we not talk about that, either?

259
00:22:14,967 --> 00:22:17,561
OK.

260
00:22:17,647 --> 00:22:20,036
What do you wanna talk about?

261
00:22:24,047 --> 00:22:28,802
You wanna be alone.
This was a bad... I should go.

262
00:22:28,887 --> 00:22:31,117
Finish your beer.

263
00:22:32,767 --> 00:22:36,999
And then you have to wait
at least an hour before you drive.

264
00:22:40,847 --> 00:22:42,838
Sir...

265
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,318
What?

266
00:22:53,407 --> 00:22:57,798
- I should have done it.
- What? Stick your head in that thing?

267
00:22:57,887 --> 00:23:00,924
Are you nuts?

268
00:23:03,207 --> 00:23:09,806
Carter, you're one of this country's natural
resources, if not national treasures.

269
00:23:12,647 --> 00:23:15,639
It couldn't have gone down any other way.

270
00:23:19,527 --> 00:23:22,121
I just... hope it's worth it.

271
00:23:23,847 --> 00:23:26,202
Even if we do find the Lost City,

272
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:29,757
even if we get there and find
what we need to defend the planet...

273
00:23:29,847 --> 00:23:33,157
That would be worth it.

274
00:23:44,087 --> 00:23:45,281
Hello.

275
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,605
In here.

276
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:02,683
Sorry. Are we interrupting anything?

277
00:24:02,767 --> 00:24:05,884
- No.
- What are you doing here?

278
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:09,437
Uh... It's a funny story, actually.

279
00:24:09,527 --> 00:24:13,725
- We were driving by and saw Sam's car...
- Funny.

280
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:18,642
Teal'c said... He didn't say anything, he
looked at me and did that eyebrow thing.

281
00:24:18,727 --> 00:24:21,639
And I said to him
"Hey, why don't we stop by..."

282
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,446
Is that doughnuts?

283
00:24:24,527 --> 00:24:26,916
- Indeed.
- Excellent.

284
00:24:33,127 --> 00:24:35,118
Rise.

285
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:41,164
My lord, I believe the humans of the
Tauri destroyed the device you sought.

286
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:46,719
- You failed to stop them.
- They anticipated our arrival, my lord.

287
00:25:02,607 --> 00:25:05,963
You are so wrong.

288
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:08,436
It's the perfect analogy.

289
00:25:08,527 --> 00:25:11,485
Burns as Goa'uld.

290
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:13,797
They are merely animated characters.

291
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,321
You are so shallow.

292
00:25:16,407 --> 00:25:19,126
Please! Teal'c is one of
the deepest people I know.

293
00:25:19,207 --> 00:25:23,120
He's so deep. Go on,
tell him how deep you are.

294
00:25:23,207 --> 00:25:26,483
You'll be lucky if you understand this.

295
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,764
- My depth is immaterial to this.
- Oh, you see?

296
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:32,962
No more beer for you.

297
00:25:33,527 --> 00:25:38,043
I'm sorry, sir, but I have to agree.
I don't see the connection.

298
00:25:38,127 --> 00:25:44,521
All right, that does it. You know, the entire
VHS collection was going to one of you.

299
00:25:44,607 --> 00:25:47,041
It's going to Siler. He gets it.

300
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,403
Thank God. Pizza.

301
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:02,640
- Well, you're not the usual delivery boy.
- Is this a good time?

302
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,446
It's always a good time
for you, sir. Come on in.

303
00:26:05,527 --> 00:26:07,995
Let me get you a chair.

304
00:26:09,127 --> 00:26:11,163
General.

305
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:13,966
At ease, Major, please.

306
00:26:14,047 --> 00:26:16,925
There you go, sir.

307
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:19,567
I'm glad to find you all here.

308
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:23,445
You wouldn't happen
to have another one of those?

309
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:27,839
I would. I hope you like Guinness, sir.

310
00:26:27,927 --> 00:26:31,636
I find it a refreshing substitute for...

311
00:26:32,807 --> 00:26:34,798
food.

312
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:41,322
I've been relieved of command.

313
00:26:45,367 --> 00:26:46,356
What?

314
00:26:46,447 --> 00:26:52,477
The president has effectively shut down
the SGC for a three-month review process.

315
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,717
- Three months?
- During which time,

316
00:26:54,807 --> 00:26:59,085
a newly-formed government department
will take the place of Stargate Command.

317
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:02,443
But, sir, the colonel -
we don't have much time.

318
00:27:02,527 --> 00:27:05,246
How could this happen?

319
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:07,045
Kinsey.

320
00:27:07,127 --> 00:27:10,358
Does anyone know anyone
who voted for those two shrubs?

321
00:27:10,447 --> 00:27:13,200
I've known Hayes for a long time.
He's a good man.

322
00:27:13,287 --> 00:27:15,847
Despite his taste
in running mates, maybe.

323
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:18,839
Robert Kinsey brought in
a lot of campaign financing,

324
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:23,876
and, for all we know, he may have used
his knowledge of the Stargate as leverage

325
00:27:23,967 --> 00:27:26,276
to get himself a place on the ticket.

326
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:29,359
- It doesn't matter now.
- We're gonna lie down for this?

327
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:31,563
We've been in this situation before.

328
00:27:31,647 --> 00:27:34,923
No. This time it's different.

329
00:27:36,047 --> 00:27:38,356
Who's replacing you, sir?

330
00:27:38,447 --> 00:27:42,281
- Her name is Dr Elizabeth Weir.
- A civilian?

331
00:27:42,367 --> 00:27:47,077
I've heard of her.
She's an expert in international politics.

332
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:52,082
She mediated high-level UN negotiations. I
referenced her in our treaty for the Tok'ra.

333
00:27:52,167 --> 00:27:56,763
I've been ordered to Washington to
discuss reassignment. I leave tomorrow.

334
00:27:56,847 --> 00:28:02,956
Uh, General, we do have a little
unfinished business here.

335
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:06,562
As far as I know, you're to report
to work as scheduled on Monday.

336
00:28:06,647 --> 00:28:09,286
- Something must be done.
- I have my orders.

337
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:14,236
Besides, I have a feeling I may be able to
do more from Washington than I can here.

338
00:28:14,327 --> 00:28:15,840
In the meantime?

339
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:19,761
You'll just have to plead your case
to the new administration.

340
00:28:19,847 --> 00:28:23,123
I have every confidence in you people.

341
00:28:48,127 --> 00:28:50,118
Amazing, isn't it?

342
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:52,357
I don't really care.

343
00:28:52,447 --> 00:28:54,358
OK.

344
00:28:54,447 --> 00:28:56,403
Wait.

345
00:28:56,487 --> 00:29:01,607
There's gonna be a lot of changes. Not
everyone's gonna be happy about them.

346
00:29:01,687 --> 00:29:04,326
Yes. I'm about to step into one myself.

347
00:29:04,407 --> 00:29:05,965
OK. Bye.

348
00:29:06,047 --> 00:29:10,404
Sorry. I walk around with this. I look
like a crazy person, talking to myself.

349
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:14,162
- Elizabeth Weir.
- Daniel Jackson.

350
00:29:14,247 --> 00:29:17,956
I can't get used to being underground.
I keep looking for a window.

351
00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,720
I see you found the one
with the best view.

352
00:29:20,807 --> 00:29:23,275
When we first tried
to get the Stargate to work,

353
00:29:23,367 --> 00:29:26,245
I would come here
and just stare at it for hours.

354
00:29:26,327 --> 00:29:31,560
Is that a gentle reminder that you've
been a part of this since the beginning?

355
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:33,842
- Subtle, huh?
- Hm.

356
00:29:38,167 --> 00:29:41,796
- So, a little light reading?
- Uh...

357
00:29:41,887 --> 00:29:44,765
I've been awake all weekend.

358
00:29:46,327 --> 00:29:49,956
The reality of this is...
it's an adrenaline rush.

359
00:29:50,047 --> 00:29:53,403
Hey, at least I know
you have a beating heart.

360
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:57,086
I don't expect a warm welcome
from the military.

361
00:29:57,167 --> 00:30:01,524
You're replacing a great man,
uniform notwithstanding.

362
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:03,325
OK.

363
00:30:03,407 --> 00:30:08,435
But I'm hoping you, of all people,
won't jump to conclusions.

364
00:30:08,527 --> 00:30:12,361
- Like, why someone like you is here.
- Someone like me?

365
00:30:12,447 --> 00:30:17,043
You started out as a political activist,
lobbying against spending on the military.

366
00:30:17,127 --> 00:30:20,961
And how I end up working
for those I was criticising? I know.

367
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:25,040
But I've decided that the best way
to stop the proliferation of weapons

368
00:30:25,127 --> 00:30:27,960
is to try and end the need for them.

369
00:30:28,047 --> 00:30:32,040
So I'm gonna be the voice of reason
to whoever will listen.

370
00:30:32,127 --> 00:30:37,838
And you think that's why the president
chose you to take over the SGC?

371
00:30:40,487 --> 00:30:44,366
I don't know why I've been given this job.
I really don't.

372
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:47,917
But I'm gonna do it to the best
of my ability as long as I'm here.

373
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:51,363
- I'll examine the mandate.
- Don't underestimate the threat.

374
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:56,282
I'm not. This country's history of Manifest
Destiny cannot continue out to the galaxy.

375
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:59,598
Especially when this is all
behind the back of the planet.

376
00:30:59,687 --> 00:31:01,757
I'm not saying everything here is right.

377
00:31:01,847 --> 00:31:05,123
We have no right to play God,
but neither do the Goa'uld.

378
00:31:05,207 --> 00:31:11,442
I know none of this may seem real to you
on paper, but, trust me, they're pure evil.

379
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:15,805
Now, if they had the chance, they would
either destroy us or enslave us all.

380
00:31:15,887 --> 00:31:18,560
You can read as many
mission reports as you want,

381
00:31:18,647 --> 00:31:21,161
but before you decide
what should be done here,

382
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:25,843
why don't you go through that gate
and see what's going on for yourself?

383
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:29,044
- In good time.
- We may not have good time.

384
00:31:29,127 --> 00:31:30,640
O'Neill doesn't.

385
00:31:30,727 --> 00:31:34,720
I want you to know, O'Neill's current
condition is of serious concern to me.

386
00:31:34,807 --> 00:31:39,278
You realise Jack did what he did because
it was our only way to find the Lost City?

387
00:31:39,367 --> 00:31:42,040
Unscheduled incoming traveller.

388
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,917
All the offworld teams are back already.

389
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:53,442
We're receiving Master Bra'tac's
personal identification code.

390
00:31:53,527 --> 00:31:56,917
- I know what a IDC is.
- He's an ally, and if we don't open the...

391
00:31:57,007 --> 00:32:00,158
I understand that. Thank you.
Go ahead, please.

392
00:32:20,247 --> 00:32:22,124
Bra'tac.

393
00:32:25,647 --> 00:32:29,959
This is Dr Elizabeth Weir.
She's the new leader of this facility.

394
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:31,446
Hello.

395
00:32:31,527 --> 00:32:34,087
Has Hammond of Texas fallen in battle?

396
00:32:34,167 --> 00:32:36,237
No, sir, he's fine.

397
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:40,366
We've had some recent changes
in our political leaders.

398
00:32:40,447 --> 00:32:42,438
I see.

399
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:48,123
Bra'tac, what's wrong?

400
00:32:49,807 --> 00:32:52,241
I am afraid I am not
the bearer of good news.

401
00:32:52,327 --> 00:32:55,444
We have had word
from Jaffa loyal to our cause.

402
00:32:55,527 --> 00:32:59,281
Anubis is gathering
the full force of his fleet.

403
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:02,757
He will be here within three days.

404
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:17,197
Bob, could we stop complaining and
start figuring out what we're going to do?

405
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:21,041
- Mr President? General Hammond.
- Show him in.

406
00:33:21,127 --> 00:33:25,439
We can't ignore a threat of this magnitude.
Hear the man out.

407
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:30,080
Well, whatever he is.
And get back to me.

408
00:33:32,727 --> 00:33:35,321
General George Hammond.

409
00:33:35,407 --> 00:33:38,080
Mr President.

410
00:33:38,167 --> 00:33:40,761
It was lieutenant
last time we spoke, wasn't it?

411
00:33:40,847 --> 00:33:44,044
For both of us.
That was a lot of hair ago, sir.

412
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:47,038
Sit down.

413
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:55,565
When I took this job, I thought I had
the weight of the world on my shoulders.

414
00:33:55,647 --> 00:33:57,922
But then I found out
what you do for a living.

415
00:33:58,007 --> 00:34:00,396
Yes, sir.

416
00:34:00,487 --> 00:34:02,842
This had nothing to do with your record.

417
00:34:02,927 --> 00:34:06,442
If the American people knew
what your contribution was...

418
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:11,362
Thank you, sir. That's kind of you to say.
One day, maybe they will.

419
00:34:14,287 --> 00:34:17,120
- Dr Weir, she's as smart as they come.
- I hope so.

420
00:34:17,207 --> 00:34:20,836
Poor thing, she has no idea
what she's gotten herself into.

421
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:24,124
But I had no choice, George.
I had to do something.

422
00:34:24,207 --> 00:34:28,883
I want you to know that I'm aware
of your history with the vice president.

423
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,720
- Yes, sir.
- Hell, we both know why I picked Kinsey.

424
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:36,517
More than the money. He delivered
Florida all by himself. If I knew then...

425
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,757
Of course.

426
00:34:39,767 --> 00:34:42,884
So, let's talk about your reassignment.

427
00:34:44,727 --> 00:34:47,036
I was thinking more of retirement, sir.

428
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:51,996
I don't think so, George. Not just yet.
I wanna keep you around Washington.

429
00:34:52,087 --> 00:34:55,124
We're gonna need you and your expertise.

430
00:34:57,487 --> 00:35:01,639
Three days from now is a Thursday.
Thursday's not good for us.

431
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:03,365
Why now?

432
00:35:03,447 --> 00:35:06,325
Anubis believes we know
the location of the Lost City.

433
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:08,398
- We don't.
- Not yet.

434
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:11,638
- But he doesn't know that we don't know.
- Well.

435
00:35:11,727 --> 00:35:14,685
Some people just
don't know when to leave.

436
00:35:14,767 --> 00:35:18,680
Colonel O'Neill. Major Carter. Teal'c.

437
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:22,366
These are strange circumstances
to be meeting...

438
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:25,439
And you are...?

439
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:29,125
I am Dr Elizabeth Weir, Colonel.

440
00:35:29,207 --> 00:35:33,678
You can just call her your one hope of
ever stepping through the Stargate again.

441
00:35:33,767 --> 00:35:35,803
Bit of a mouthful.

442
00:35:35,887 --> 00:35:39,482
I know I'm playing catch-up,
but I understand time is short.

443
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:41,956
Actually, it's all relative, ma'am.

444
00:35:42,047 --> 00:35:46,120
Carter could explain it better,
if we had more time.

445
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:49,445
Shall we have a seat, then?

446
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:56,078
- This is a situation of grave importance.
- She's quick.

447
00:35:56,167 --> 00:36:01,241
Which is why I've taken it upon myself
to come and hear Mr Bra'tac personally.

448
00:36:01,327 --> 00:36:04,319
Master Bra'tac. Master.

449
00:36:04,927 --> 00:36:07,725
I beg your pardon.

450
00:36:09,687 --> 00:36:16,286
So you believe the Goa'uld Anubis
is planning to attack?

451
00:36:16,367 --> 00:36:19,598
You may be certain of it.

452
00:36:19,687 --> 00:36:22,724
I'll say this - the timing is impeccable.

453
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:27,440
The moment we suspend Stargate
operations, you pull this out of your hat.

454
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:33,284
Mr Vice President, if you're suggesting
that we'd make something like this up...

455
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:37,883
- That's exactly what I'm suggesting.
- Well, that is exactly what we do.

456
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:42,279
We sit around on our fat asses and create
scenarios that put the planet at risk.

457
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:45,439
- That's what we do.
- I think you'd do about anything.

458
00:36:45,527 --> 00:36:47,199
Gentlemen.

459
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:52,566
Let's assume that Master Bra'tac
is in earnest and that the threat is real.

460
00:36:52,647 --> 00:36:57,038
Do you know what the threat is? Anubis
is half-Goa'uld, half-ascended Ancient,

461
00:36:57,127 --> 00:37:01,564
with the knowledge and technology
to wipe us all from the face of the Earth.

462
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:06,562
- What about negotiating?
- For crying out loud, that's derentis.

463
00:37:11,807 --> 00:37:14,367
- What?
- You just said "derentis".

464
00:37:15,167 --> 00:37:18,557
- Did not.
- Did too.

465
00:37:18,647 --> 00:37:20,956
- "Derentis", what is that?
- Latin?

466
00:37:21,047 --> 00:37:24,039
- It's not.
- I think what he is trying to say is that,

467
00:37:24,127 --> 00:37:27,802
based on our past experiences,
negotiating would be insane. Crazy.

468
00:37:27,887 --> 00:37:29,400
- I got that.
- However,

469
00:37:29,487 --> 00:37:34,845
we believe there may be alien technology
within our reach that could defeat Anubis.

470
00:37:34,927 --> 00:37:37,395
Now you're pulling a ray gun
out of your hat?

471
00:37:37,487 --> 00:37:40,923
Weapons capable of defending this planet.

472
00:37:41,007 --> 00:37:43,567
I can't believe we're listening to this.

473
00:37:43,647 --> 00:37:45,877
Mr Vice President, on his last...

474
00:37:45,967 --> 00:37:50,677
I am aware of the events that have,
once again, compromised

475
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,918
Colonel O'Neill's invaluable judgement.

476
00:37:54,007 --> 00:37:56,999
And the fact that
on his last official mission,

477
00:37:57,087 --> 00:38:01,399
he has incurred the wrath of humanity's
worst enemy on behalf of us all...

478
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:07,164
Wait a minute. I thought you didn't
buy into the whole invasion thing.

479
00:38:07,247 --> 00:38:10,683
The fact is, until we know
the location of the Lost City...

480
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,917
I know where it is.

481
00:38:14,127 --> 00:38:17,119
You know where it is now?

482
00:38:17,207 --> 00:38:20,882
I will. It's in there somewhere.

483
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:28,045
Look, let me make this simple.

484
00:38:28,127 --> 00:38:31,324
I come up with the Lost City,
we go find it. Yes or no?

485
00:38:31,407 --> 00:38:33,398
No!

486
00:38:37,247 --> 00:38:40,364
Who are you, really?

487
00:38:40,447 --> 00:38:43,120
And why are you here?

488
00:38:43,207 --> 00:38:46,517
I will consider it.

489
00:38:47,927 --> 00:38:50,680
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

490
00:38:54,527 --> 00:38:56,961
I must return to Chulak.

491
00:38:57,047 --> 00:38:59,356
I, too, will go.

492
00:38:59,447 --> 00:39:03,645
In the hope of procuring ships
and warriors to defend this world.

493
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:05,718
Good luck.

494
00:39:26,087 --> 00:39:29,523
- What the hell was that?
- I'm sorry?

495
00:39:29,607 --> 00:39:31,996
You don't know O'Neill like I do.

496
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,686
This is my call. Colonel O'Neill...

497
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:39,918
- Is the one who got us into this mess.
- I don't see...

498
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:44,125
I want him gone. I want them all gone.
You haven't figured that out yet?

499
00:39:44,207 --> 00:39:49,759
- Oh, I've figured out quite a bit.
- Well, hallelujah for that.

500
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:53,157
This is my office. This is my chair.

501
00:39:53,247 --> 00:39:56,922
Until I'm told otherwise,
I'm gonna make decisions as I see fit.

502
00:39:57,007 --> 00:40:00,920
- Not as they fit into your agenda.
- You have no idea what my agenda is.

503
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:03,885
Whatever your agenda is.

504
00:40:04,807 --> 00:40:10,803
You don't know anything. If you think
you do, you're not as smart as I thought.

505
00:40:22,007 --> 00:40:27,161
So, T... if I don't see you again.

506
00:40:27,247 --> 00:40:31,399
- I will see you soon, O'Neill.
- You know something I don't?

507
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:35,719
In fact, it is you that
knows something that I do not.

508
00:40:35,807 --> 00:40:38,367
Hope you're right.

509
00:40:50,807 --> 00:40:53,241
I wish you all well.

510
00:41:29,807 --> 00:41:33,402
- Does this mean anything to you?
- No.

511
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:39,722
- Could you at least look at it?
- Daniel, I don't speak Ancient. Yet.

512
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:43,356
And when I do, eventually,
you know I'll never understand it.

513
00:41:43,447 --> 00:41:45,278
You have to try.

514
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:47,961
Last time, things just popped into my fron.

515
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:51,960
- Fron is "head".
- I have no idea what you're talking about.

516
00:41:52,047 --> 00:41:55,005
Maybe if you stopped working on
this stupid crossword.

517
00:41:55,087 --> 00:41:58,477
I'd like to at least finish that while I can.

518
00:41:59,527 --> 00:42:02,246
- I thought...
- 13 across, you wrote "taonas".

519
00:42:02,327 --> 00:42:05,080
Yeah, so? What's it mean?

520
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:09,126
I don't know, you tell me.
Eight down, you wrote "praclarush".

521
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:11,801
What's eight down?

522
00:42:11,887 --> 00:42:18,042
"Label". There's empty spaces. I think the
answer is supposed to be "identification".

523
00:42:18,127 --> 00:42:21,164
13 across is "sphere".

524
00:42:21,247 --> 00:42:23,522
Jack, this is it.

525
00:42:24,647 --> 00:42:28,959
See, I assume we still speak
the same language. Mostly.

526
00:42:29,047 --> 00:42:31,197
Sphere, planet. Label, name.

527
00:42:31,287 --> 00:42:34,438
- Following still you not.
- Praclarush Taonas.

528
00:42:34,527 --> 00:42:40,796
You wrote the name of the planet where
we'll find the Lost City in the crossword.

529
00:42:40,887 --> 00:42:44,357
- Bit of a jump.
- Why else would you do that?

530
00:42:45,567 --> 00:42:49,924
The clue for seven down is "celestial
body". And he wrote "Uma Thurman".

531
00:42:50,007 --> 00:42:52,123
Yes.

532
00:42:53,527 --> 00:42:56,041
It has to mean something.

533
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,118
It does.

534
00:43:05,727 --> 00:43:07,922
I'm hungry.

535
00:43:15,247 --> 00:43:17,966
Praclarush Taonas.

536
00:43:18,047 --> 00:43:23,121
According to this, it means "lost in fire".
This has to be the planet of the Lost City.

537
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:29,555
Knowing the name of the planet doesn't
help, unless we have a gate address.

538
00:43:44,327 --> 00:43:46,557
Jack, what are you doing?

539
00:43:48,407 --> 00:43:50,443
- At.
- What?

540
00:43:51,687 --> 00:43:52,836
At.

541
00:43:52,927 --> 00:43:54,326
- This?
- That.

542
00:43:54,407 --> 00:43:57,319
- That is at?
- You can stop that.

543
00:43:57,407 --> 00:44:01,685
- Don't ask what it means, I don't know.
- I think I do.

544
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:13,844
- What's this?
- Sh!

545
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:18,885
- Well?
- You just told us to be quiet.

546
00:44:18,967 --> 00:44:22,960
No. When I look at this, I think "Sh".

547
00:44:23,807 --> 00:44:26,685
- That's it.
- What?

548
00:44:29,927 --> 00:44:32,964
"Praclarush Taonas". Six syllables.

549
00:44:33,487 --> 00:44:36,559
What if each symbol on
the Stargate has a sound?

550
00:44:36,647 --> 00:44:40,356
- Like an alphabet?
- Praclarush Taonas isn't just the name.

551
00:44:40,447 --> 00:44:43,007
It's also the gate address.

552
00:44:48,287 --> 00:44:52,565
At is the Earth's symbol.
Our point of origin.

553
00:44:52,647 --> 00:44:54,797
Praclarush Taonas At.

554
00:44:54,887 --> 00:44:58,118
- So this would lead us to the Lost City.
- It has to.

555
00:44:58,207 --> 00:45:00,277
Wait a minute.

556
00:45:00,367 --> 00:45:04,280
We dialled this address two years ago,
but couldn't establish a wormhole.

557
00:45:04,367 --> 00:45:06,835
- The gate must be buried.
- Lost in fire.

558
00:45:06,927 --> 00:45:09,077
What we need could still be there.

559
00:45:09,167 --> 00:45:13,922
I could use the address to calculate the
planet's location, but we'll need a ship.

560
00:45:14,007 --> 00:45:15,679
Prometheus.

561
00:45:15,767 --> 00:45:19,362
But with Anubis on his way,
Prometheus is our last line of defence.

562
00:45:19,447 --> 00:45:22,086
Maybe Teal'c has something by now.

563
00:45:22,167 --> 00:45:24,727
Where's Colonel O'Neill?

564
00:45:25,847 --> 00:45:27,280
Packing.

565
00:45:29,607 --> 00:45:31,962
- Colonel.
- Don't ask.

566
00:45:32,047 --> 00:45:35,084
The last time, he just did things
without knowing why.

567
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:38,318
It's a good sign.
It means we're on the right track.

568
00:45:38,407 --> 00:45:41,240
- Sir?
- I don't know, Carter.

569
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:49,279
Grab a naqahdah generator, will ya?

570
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:08,722
I am Ronan.

571
00:46:08,807 --> 00:46:11,241
I knew your father.

572
00:46:11,327 --> 00:46:13,397
It is an honour.

573
00:46:18,207 --> 00:46:21,597
- I have a ship at my disposal.
- So we have heard.

574
00:46:21,687 --> 00:46:24,440
Forgive me, but, as brave as you are,

575
00:46:24,527 --> 00:46:28,076
you cannot hope to stop
the fleet of Anubis with just one ship.

576
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:30,203
I have seen the extent of his forces.

577
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,121
We only wish to use your ship to help us
find something much more powerful.

578
00:46:34,207 --> 00:46:38,519
Something that we believe
will defeat Anubis once and for all.

579
00:46:38,607 --> 00:46:42,156
If that is true, then I will join you.

580
00:46:44,647 --> 00:46:47,036
That is my only condition.

581
00:46:50,287 --> 00:46:54,041
- I am a fine pilot.
- So we have heard.

582
00:47:00,647 --> 00:47:05,163
Have you got everything you need?
I think there's still the sink in the kitchen.

583
00:47:05,247 --> 00:47:07,124
Was that a joke?

584
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:09,596
Perhaps. A bad one.

585
00:47:09,687 --> 00:47:11,996
Yes, very bad.

586
00:47:12,087 --> 00:47:14,521
But I sense hope for you.

587
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:19,522
Well, I hope for all of us that you find
what you're looking for, Colonel.

588
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:21,598
Thank you.

589
00:47:45,247 --> 00:47:46,475
What?

590
00:47:46,567 --> 00:47:48,876
I would have done it, you know.

591
00:47:51,287 --> 00:47:54,757
- I know.
- There has to be a way to reverse it.

592
00:47:54,847 --> 00:47:57,759
Once we have what we need.

593
00:47:57,847 --> 00:48:00,680
We'll find a way.

594
00:48:04,647 --> 00:48:09,038
We're coaxing everything out of
the engines, but we're still two days away.

595
00:48:09,127 --> 00:48:12,199
- How you feeling, sir?
- A bit cruvis.

596
00:48:13,607 --> 00:48:16,280
A little fron ache.

597
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:23,796
We need to go faster.

598
00:48:38,767 --> 00:48:40,405
A short time ago,

599
00:48:40,487 --> 00:48:44,321
our radar detected three Goa'uld
vessels emerging from hyperspace.

600
00:48:44,407 --> 00:48:46,443
Looks like you were wrong, Bob.

601
00:48:46,527 --> 00:48:50,406
Three Goa'uld ships is hardly
the full force of Anubis's fleet.

602
00:48:50,487 --> 00:48:52,637
It sounds to me like Anubis wants to know

603
00:48:52,727 --> 00:48:56,356
if SG-1 was successful in
procuring Ancient defence technology.

604
00:48:56,447 --> 00:48:59,678
- They weren't.
- Not yet, but Anubis doesn't know.

605
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:04,238
He's most likely holding back his invasion
fleet till he finds out what we've got.

606
00:49:04,327 --> 00:49:08,559
Sir, Prometheus and our fleet of 302s
can give them a run for their money.

607
00:49:08,647 --> 00:49:12,401
- If that's all he throws at us, I agree.
- Then let's do it.

608
00:49:12,487 --> 00:49:15,479
However, Mr President,
I agree with your assessment.

609
00:49:15,567 --> 00:49:20,118
Anubis wants to goad us into a precipitous
action which will show our hand.

610
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:24,325
I believe launching the Prometheus now
will only serve to demonstrate

611
00:49:24,407 --> 00:49:29,276
we lack the very advanced weaponry
Anubis is afraid of.

612
00:49:30,887 --> 00:49:33,276
Remain at DEFCON 3 for the time being,

613
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:37,963
but contact the governments of Russia,
Great Britain, France, China and Canada.

614
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,038
Let 'em know what we think we're in for.

615
00:49:40,127 --> 00:49:44,359
In the meantime,
I better prepare a hell of a speech.

616
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,324
Thank you.

617
00:49:57,527 --> 00:49:59,518
Gimme your zat.

618
00:50:10,727 --> 00:50:13,560
There you go.

619
00:50:13,647 --> 00:50:15,478
Sir,

620
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:19,446
you should know that General Hammond
authorised me to take command...

621
00:50:19,527 --> 00:50:22,121
- Do it now.
- I don't think that's necessary.

622
00:50:22,207 --> 00:50:24,437
I trust you.

623
00:50:24,527 --> 00:50:26,836
I'll make it easy for you.

624
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:30,078
I resign. You're in charge.

625
00:50:30,807 --> 00:50:32,525
OK.

626
00:50:33,607 --> 00:50:38,635
At your house, before Daniel and Teal'c
showed up, what I was gonna say was...

627
00:50:38,727 --> 00:50:40,718
I know.

628
00:51:04,847 --> 00:51:10,205
My lord. The advance Ha'tak reports
that they have received no challenge.

629
00:51:10,287 --> 00:51:13,324
Order them to begin the attack.

630
00:51:13,407 --> 00:51:18,356
If the Tauri have weapons
of the Ancients, we shall see.

631
00:51:35,407 --> 00:51:40,401
This doesn't look good. The surface is
almost completely covered by lava flows.

632
00:51:40,487 --> 00:51:42,557
How could there have been a civilisation?

633
00:51:42,647 --> 00:51:45,798
A star becomes a red giant
near the end of its life.

634
00:51:45,887 --> 00:51:48,959
A million years ago, this planet
may have looked like Earth.

635
00:51:49,047 --> 00:51:51,880
- So we're a million years late?
- Probably more.

636
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:53,923
That's very late.

637
00:51:57,727 --> 00:51:59,718
What?

638
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:10,005
I have scanned the entire surface.

639
00:52:11,167 --> 00:52:14,318
What do you want me to say?
I don't even know why we're here.

640
00:52:14,407 --> 00:52:17,365
But you did pack the hazmat suits for us.

641
00:52:17,447 --> 00:52:21,235
You knew the condition of the planet
and that we would have to go there.

642
00:52:21,327 --> 00:52:25,320
- Then you know more than I do.
- No, sir. I don't.

643
00:52:25,407 --> 00:52:27,796
Sit down and take a look.

644
00:52:30,167 --> 00:52:32,840
That's an order.

645
00:52:39,887 --> 00:52:41,684
Easy.

646
00:52:55,527 --> 00:52:57,836
Taonas.

647
00:52:57,927 --> 00:53:00,236
- Sir?
- What?

648
00:53:00,327 --> 00:53:03,922
You looked at the screen
and said "Taonas".

649
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,796
- If you say so.
- You say so.

650
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:16,201
There's a small anomaly
on the surface here. Like a bubble.

651
00:53:16,287 --> 00:53:18,642
Is it a cavern?

652
00:53:18,727 --> 00:53:22,197
It looks like a perfectly-formed
half-sphere of molten rock.

653
00:53:22,287 --> 00:53:25,245
Perhaps a force field for
the city was covered over.

654
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:29,525
Too small to have a city in there.
We aren't getting energy readings from it.

655
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:31,962
Perhaps the shield has since failed.

656
00:53:32,047 --> 00:53:34,925
We should still check it out.

657
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:41,085
We've managed to contact
the captain of the Spruance,

658
00:53:41,167 --> 00:53:43,761
a destroyer in the Nimitz battle group.

659
00:53:43,847 --> 00:53:46,122
Some beam came outta the sky.

660
00:53:46,207 --> 00:53:50,405
There wasn't any warning, but
the entire carrier just went up in a fireball.

661
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:52,796
- Captain, can you see the enemy?
- Holy/

662
00:53:52,887 --> 00:53:57,199
Another cruiser just blew up.
Where the hell's the fire coming from?

663
00:54:11,447 --> 00:54:14,757
The engagement began
less than five minutes ago.

664
00:54:14,847 --> 00:54:18,203
And that was only one Goa'uld ship.

665
00:54:33,447 --> 00:54:38,396
Here, the crust may be thin enough
for the rings to penetrate.

666
00:54:38,487 --> 00:54:40,478
Stand by.

667
00:54:53,167 --> 00:54:57,365
- Can you still hear us?
- Indeed. Loudly and clearly.

668
00:54:57,447 --> 00:55:01,725
We will move a safe distance,
and return on your signal.

669
00:55:04,207 --> 00:55:06,562
The radiation level's high.

670
00:55:06,647 --> 00:55:12,563
I believe Ronan was correct.
A shield once protected this structure.

671
00:55:12,647 --> 00:55:16,276
It's possible the rings
compromise the dome's integrity.

672
00:55:16,367 --> 00:55:20,440
Too bad.
Otherwise, it's very pleasant.

673
00:55:50,727 --> 00:55:56,882
Architecture definitely indicates
this was built by the Ancients.

674
00:55:56,967 --> 00:56:00,562
This facility
does not appear operational.

675
00:56:00,647 --> 00:56:06,438
I don't know about you guys,
but I'm hoping this isn't the Lost City.

676
00:56:07,927 --> 00:56:10,202
Sir, be careful.

677
00:56:13,647 --> 00:56:17,117
Jack, you sure you know
what you're doing?

678
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,481
The atmosphere is safe.

679
00:56:59,487 --> 00:57:01,955
It's a map of the galaxy.

680
00:57:02,047 --> 00:57:06,916
Looks like every planet the Ancients
ever colonised is indicated here.

681
00:57:07,007 --> 00:57:09,805
This is where we are - Praclarush.

682
00:57:13,207 --> 00:57:15,437
That's our solar system.

683
00:57:16,487 --> 00:57:20,924
- Earth.
- That does not appear to be Earth.

684
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:26,001
It doesn't take into consideration
the 30 million years of continental drift.

685
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:28,760
Sir, why are you showing us this?

686
00:57:31,687 --> 00:57:33,678
Jack?

687
00:57:36,407 --> 00:57:38,079
Terre Atlantis.

688
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:40,806
"Terre" is Earth. Atlantis.

689
00:57:40,887 --> 00:57:44,084
The Lost City of Atlantis?

690
00:57:45,047 --> 00:57:49,245
Are you saying
the Lost City of the Ancients is here?

691
00:57:51,447 --> 00:57:53,358
Antarctica.

692
00:57:53,447 --> 00:57:55,677
Subo glaciuse.

693
00:57:55,767 --> 00:58:01,285
"Under the ice." The city we've been
looking for is under the ice of Antarctica.

694
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:03,961
It's been on Earth the whole time?

695
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:06,526
We were there.

696
00:58:06,607 --> 00:58:10,282
We came all this way just to find out
that we have to go all the way back.

697
00:58:10,367 --> 00:58:11,720
No.

698
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:40,686
A power source.

699
00:58:43,407 --> 00:58:45,398
Bra'tac, we're on our way.

700
00:58:45,487 --> 00:58:48,718
We know the location of the Lost City.
It's on Earth.

701
00:58:49,047 --> 00:58:51,481
Understood, Major Carter.

702
00:58:51,567 --> 00:58:55,355
Pilot the vessel.
I will see to the transport rings.

703
00:58:59,687 --> 00:59:01,962
I am betrayed.

704
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:05,960
You are the betrayer
of your one true god, Anubis.

705
00:59:12,887 --> 00:59:16,482
You should have struck
for my heart, Ronan.

706
00:59:16,567 --> 00:59:18,683
You will die more slowly this way.

707
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:22,521
You are mistaken.
I no longer carry a symbiote.

708
00:59:36,887 --> 00:59:39,401
I don't think
the dome's gonna hold.

709
00:59:42,927 --> 00:59:45,805
You are weak, old man.

710
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:55,682
Bra'tac,
what's happening up there?

711
01:00:05,167 --> 01:00:08,398
You may be younger, but not the wiser.

712
01:00:20,447 --> 01:00:22,517
Bra'tac, the dome is collapsing.

713
01:00:40,847 --> 01:00:43,725
Secure the ship.

714
01:00:53,767 --> 01:00:57,555
Ronan was an agent of Anubis.

715
01:00:57,647 --> 01:01:00,115
Save your strength, old friend.

716
01:01:00,207 --> 01:01:07,045
You know that I am stubborn, Teal'c,
but this battle I fear I cannot win.

717
01:01:41,567 --> 01:01:44,718
The pain is fading.

718
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:48,318
Jack!

719
01:01:59,847 --> 01:02:03,760
Once more, I am in your debt.

720
01:02:03,847 --> 01:02:05,838
But how?

721
01:02:05,927 --> 01:02:09,124
O'Neill possesses
the healing power of the Ancients.

722
01:02:09,207 --> 01:02:14,201
I guess your condition's
a little more advanced than last time.

723
01:02:14,287 --> 01:02:17,404
Teal'c, set a course for Earth.

724
01:02:25,207 --> 01:02:30,679
Our F/A-22s and ABLs are all in the air, but
so far there's been nothing to intercept.

725
01:02:30,767 --> 01:02:34,316
Since the battle group was destroyed,
the Goa'uld haven't fired.

726
01:02:34,407 --> 01:02:37,365
Why not a city or two?
Just to prove his point.

727
01:02:50,607 --> 01:02:53,679
Hold your fire! It's a hologram.

728
01:02:54,927 --> 01:02:57,077
I am Anubis.

729
01:03:02,327 --> 01:03:06,559
- You've got to be kidding.
- You are the leader of this world.

730
01:03:06,647 --> 01:03:10,720
Henry Hayes.
President of the United States of America.

731
01:03:10,807 --> 01:03:13,275
One nation among many.

732
01:03:13,367 --> 01:03:16,962
No more. Bow before your god.

733
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:20,402
I don't think so.

734
01:03:20,487 --> 01:03:23,479
However, I am willing
to discuss your surrender.

735
01:03:23,567 --> 01:03:28,516
If you possessed weapons matching
mine, you would have used them.

736
01:03:28,607 --> 01:03:31,519
Don't let the suit fool ya, fella.
We're gonna fight.

737
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:33,962
You bring destruction upon yourselves.

738
01:03:34,047 --> 01:03:36,117
Never going to happen.

739
01:03:43,087 --> 01:03:44,645
Too much?

740
01:03:56,567 --> 01:03:58,603
OK.

741
01:03:58,687 --> 01:04:04,876
Sir, 30-plus ships just appeared in orbit,
taking station around the planet.

742
01:04:09,647 --> 01:04:11,365
He didn't buy it.

743
01:04:11,447 --> 01:04:14,519
It's time to go to the Alpha site.
You can stay in contact...

744
01:04:14,607 --> 01:04:17,485
Bob, go ahead.

745
01:04:17,567 --> 01:04:21,446
- Mr President...
- No, no. Go ahead. I'm staying.

746
01:04:30,487 --> 01:04:34,036
You're all welcome to join him.

747
01:04:34,127 --> 01:04:37,881
I think you know
we're staying here with you, sir.

748
01:04:38,887 --> 01:04:43,438
- George, you deserve the right to go.
- No, sir. I think I'll stay as well.

749
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:45,199
Good.

750
01:04:45,287 --> 01:04:49,360
If you'll accept it,
I've got another job for you.

751
01:05:06,687 --> 01:05:10,236
Are you preparing
a weapon for battle, O'Neill?

752
01:05:11,287 --> 01:05:17,283
Sensors have detected an armada
of Goa'uld ships in orbit around Earth.

753
01:05:19,287 --> 01:05:23,883
Can you understand anything
that I'm saying, O'Neill?

754
01:05:33,127 --> 01:05:35,595
O'Neill.

755
01:05:35,687 --> 01:05:38,247
I wish for you to know that...

756
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:08,240
Mr President, in the last two hours,
the enemy has focused on

757
01:06:08,327 --> 01:06:12,923
systematically taking out power grids
and broadcast terminals around the globe.

758
01:06:13,007 --> 01:06:17,000
They seem to wanna
disable our communications.

759
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:21,084
So much for my speech.

760
01:06:21,167 --> 01:06:24,045
We're doing our best
to get the word out to the public.

761
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,765
Saying what?

762
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:29,362
For the moment
we're sticking with a meteor shower.

763
01:06:29,447 --> 01:06:35,283
That'll only hold up as long as those ships
stay out of range. Go to DEFCON 1.

764
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:39,280
John, launch Prometheus.

765
01:06:48,327 --> 01:06:51,956
I thought you were a lot of things.
A coward wasn't one of them.

766
01:06:52,047 --> 01:06:54,117
I'm a pragmatist, Doctor.

767
01:06:54,207 --> 01:06:58,678
Someone has to ensure the survival of the
human race and the American way of live.

768
01:06:58,767 --> 01:07:02,760
By the way, if you survive, you're through.

769
01:07:05,407 --> 01:07:07,443
- What's going on?
- We've lost power.

770
01:07:07,527 --> 01:07:11,315
- Get it back!
- Manual Iris control. Close it, now.

771
01:07:16,807 --> 01:07:20,641
What do you think you're doing?
Open that Iris and dial the Alpha site.

772
01:07:20,727 --> 01:07:24,163
Unauthorised offworld activation.

773
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:29,919
- That was a nuke. Or worse.
- Anubis has dialled in.

774
01:07:30,007 --> 01:07:33,283
- You're not going anywhere.
- Get me out of here. You hear me?

775
01:07:33,367 --> 01:07:37,406
- Just received a message from SG-1.
- It's not coming through the gate.

776
01:07:37,487 --> 01:07:41,116
- I don't give a damn!
- Well, I do!

777
01:07:42,167 --> 01:07:43,202
Dr Weir.

778
01:07:43,287 --> 01:07:47,075
Mr President, Prometheus can't win
against an entire Goa'uld fleet,

779
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:50,239
but it could buy SG-1
time to complete their mission.

780
01:07:50,327 --> 01:07:56,482
Mr President, that is downright insane.
I am relieving Dr Weir, taking command...

781
01:07:56,567 --> 01:08:01,687
- Sir, from what I've looked at...
- Will you shut the hell up?

782
01:08:01,767 --> 01:08:04,042
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Not you, Doctor.

783
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:06,405
Excuse me?

784
01:08:06,487 --> 01:08:09,797
- Consider your resignation accepted.
- You can't do that.

785
01:08:09,887 --> 01:08:12,481
Oh, please.
I got enough on you to have you shot.

786
01:08:12,567 --> 01:08:15,365
This is the biggest mistake
you will ever make.

787
01:08:15,447 --> 01:08:20,237
But I think I'll stick with my original
thought, which is, shut the hell up.

788
01:08:20,327 --> 01:08:22,966
I promise, you will only live to regret this.

789
01:08:24,047 --> 01:08:26,356
Go ahead, Dr Weir.

790
01:08:26,447 --> 01:08:31,362
I believe, sir, sending Prometheus
to cover SG-1 is our best hope.

791
01:08:33,647 --> 01:08:36,480
We have our orders.
Let's get this bird in the air.

792
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:41,516
Set inertial compensators and shields
at maximum. Initiate launch sequence.

793
01:08:54,487 --> 01:08:58,446
Jack's modifying the transmitter.
We'll use it to bore a hole through the ice.

794
01:08:58,527 --> 01:09:02,122
- We must first defeat the forces of Anubis.
- How we gonna do that?

795
01:09:02,207 --> 01:09:05,483
You must exit hyperspace
close to the Earth's atmosphere.

796
01:09:05,567 --> 01:09:10,846
- To be on the other side of the armada.
- There won't be much time to decelerate.

797
01:09:10,927 --> 01:09:14,237
Of that I am aware, old friend.

798
01:09:28,167 --> 01:09:32,877
- Teal'c, you're gonna pull up, right?
- I am attempting to do so.

799
01:09:51,527 --> 01:09:52,516
Where now?

800
01:09:52,607 --> 01:09:58,284
It has to be near the coordinates
where we found the second Stargate.

801
01:10:18,167 --> 01:10:19,361
My lord.

802
01:10:19,447 --> 01:10:24,202
A scout ship has exited hyperspace and
is heading for the planet's southern pole.

803
01:10:46,007 --> 01:10:48,601
Sir, how long is this gonna take?

804
01:10:55,767 --> 01:10:59,282
- Anubis cannot have missed our arrival.
- You are correct.

805
01:10:59,367 --> 01:11:02,439
Al-kesh and gliders approach. Many.

806
01:11:05,887 --> 01:11:09,436
They will be in firing range in 30 seconds.

807
01:11:14,447 --> 01:11:18,042
More ships approaching
from the opposite direction.

808
01:11:18,127 --> 01:11:22,723
- Sir, we're about to get our a...
- They are not Goa'uld.

809
01:11:39,287 --> 01:11:41,926
Defend that scout ship at all cost.

810
01:11:42,007 --> 01:11:43,326
Prometheus.

811
01:11:43,407 --> 01:11:46,524
SG-1, this is Hammond.
Do you read?

812
01:11:46,607 --> 01:11:49,041
Yes, sir. It's good to see you.

813
01:11:49,127 --> 01:11:51,118
Let's go.

814
01:12:03,287 --> 01:12:06,677
Colonel, how are we
gonna get down there?

815
01:12:07,887 --> 01:12:09,161
The rings.

816
01:12:09,247 --> 01:12:12,796
The Ancients built the Stargates,
there must be a set of rings.

817
01:12:12,887 --> 01:12:17,005
The transmission beam
just couldn't penetrate a mile of ice.

818
01:12:21,727 --> 01:12:26,243
- We're taking damage to the outer hull.
- F302s have expended their ordnance.

819
01:12:26,327 --> 01:12:29,478
We can't take them aboard.
They'll have to divert to McMurdo.

820
01:12:29,567 --> 01:12:33,401
- We need to recharge the shields.
- Hold your position.

821
01:12:37,167 --> 01:12:39,601
Ready.

822
01:12:40,887 --> 01:12:42,639
Good luck.

823
01:13:08,687 --> 01:13:12,475
- We are in range, my lord.
- Fire.

824
01:13:14,847 --> 01:13:17,077
- Shields are failing.
- Scout ship clear.

825
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:20,318
Set a course for Anubis's mothership.
Move us out of here.

826
01:13:20,407 --> 01:13:22,716
Main engines on line. Emergency thrust.

827
01:13:27,927 --> 01:13:30,043
Tauri vessel is abandoning its position.

828
01:13:37,407 --> 01:13:40,683
This looks vaguely familiar.

829
01:13:58,007 --> 01:14:00,601
Dormata.

830
01:14:00,687 --> 01:14:01,915
"Sleep"?

831
01:14:16,047 --> 01:14:20,359
You are too late.
The power of the Ancients is mine.

832
01:14:34,967 --> 01:14:36,764
Fools.

833
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:40,367
It's a hologram.

834
01:15:25,487 --> 01:15:29,446
- The human attack vessel approaches.
- Destroy it.

835
01:15:53,767 --> 01:15:56,725
Sir, whatever you're gonna do...

836
01:16:00,367 --> 01:16:03,564
Shields are down.
Weapons are expended.

837
01:16:03,647 --> 01:16:06,923
- The next hit's gonna take us out.
- Hold your course.

838
01:16:07,007 --> 01:16:09,885
Brace for a collision. If we go, they go.

839
01:17:25,007 --> 01:17:29,319
- Weapons fire coming from the surface.
- Break off course. Get us clear.

840
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:39,318
Our shields are of no use.

841
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,438
No!

842
01:17:51,847 --> 01:17:55,965
- What the hell was that?
- That was SG-1.

843
01:17:56,047 --> 01:18:00,882
Thousands of bright yellow... I don't
know, they're coming from the surface.

844
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:06,439
They're cutting the enemy fleet to shreds.
My God, it's beautiful.

845
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:14,118
Sir?

846
01:18:15,127 --> 01:18:16,719
Sir?

847
01:18:18,047 --> 01:18:20,720
His pulse is erratic.

848
01:18:20,807 --> 01:18:23,241
Don't you dare leave us now. We won.

849
01:18:24,007 --> 01:18:25,998
Colonel!

850
01:18:27,127 --> 01:18:29,925
Sir, I have the president for you.

851
01:18:31,047 --> 01:18:33,766
Patch him through.

852
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:39,240
Mr President, I'm confirming the enemy's
been defeated. The threat is eliminated.

853
01:18:39,327 --> 01:18:42,160
Congratulations, George.

854
01:18:42,247 --> 01:18:47,241
I don't know how we're ever
going to be able to thank you.

855
01:18:50,847 --> 01:18:53,407
Please, Jack.

856
01:18:57,927 --> 01:19:00,361
Dormata.

857
01:19:02,047 --> 01:19:04,038
That thing.

858
01:19:23,127 --> 01:19:25,641
Now what?

859
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:29,879
Aveo... amacuse.

860
01:19:32,767 --> 01:19:34,564
Goodbye.

861
01:19:54,687 --> 01:19:59,966
We can't just leave him like this. There
has to be a way to reverse the process.

862
01:20:00,047 --> 01:20:04,165
- I don't think this is it, Sam.
- What do you mean?

863
01:20:04,247 --> 01:20:07,159
The dome's too small. It's like Taonas.

864
01:20:07,247 --> 01:20:10,364
It's obviously not a city.
It's an outpost of some kind.

865
01:20:10,447 --> 01:20:13,405
- This isn't Atlantis?
- I don't think so.

866
01:20:15,047 --> 01:20:20,679
If this is not the Lost City...
then where is it?
