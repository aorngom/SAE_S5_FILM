1
00:00:05,607 --> 00:00:07,677
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

2
00:00:07,767 --> 00:00:11,043
- Sarah.
- Daniel.

3
00:00:11,127 --> 00:00:13,641
We could have ended it better than we did.

4
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,399
Maybe.

5
00:00:20,847 --> 00:00:22,644
Sarah?

6
00:00:28,527 --> 00:00:30,882
Are you happy, Sam?

7
00:00:30,967 --> 00:00:35,643
- What?
- You deserve to love someone.

8
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:39,366
Maybe it's not me that's the problem here.

9
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,276
I'm a safe bet.

10
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:46,598
The tablet talks of a lost city
that's more valuable than anything.

11
00:00:46,687 --> 00:00:49,884
Are you saying the Ancients
actually lost one of their own cities?

12
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:54,518
No, they didn't lose it. They made it lost...
to other people that might try to find it.

13
00:00:54,607 --> 00:00:55,801
So...

14
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:59,596
the Lost City is... still lost.

15
00:01:16,007 --> 00:01:21,684
Amulet is from the 12th dynastic period.
Inlay suggests the house of Amenemhet.

16
00:01:21,767 --> 00:01:26,636
Possibly a gift from the king's family to
commemorate a birth, coming of age, or...

17
00:01:26,727 --> 00:01:28,718
It's for luck.

18
00:01:31,567 --> 00:01:35,879
Royal goldsmiths made them for the king,
hoping floodwaters would rise in the Nile,

19
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:38,162
granting them a bountiful crop.

20
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:41,798
Good guess.

21
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:46,881
Dr Jordan sent me a picture a few weeks
ago. I suppose I had a bit of a head start.

22
00:01:48,367 --> 00:01:50,323
I'm Sarah Gardner.

23
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,683
- Is that seat taken?
- Well, no.

24
00:03:29,767 --> 00:03:33,521
But there are plenty
of other empty... tables.

25
00:03:33,607 --> 00:03:37,282
Yeah, but none of them have single,
beautiful women sitting at them.

26
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:40,723
- How do you know I'm single?
- There's no ring on your finger.

27
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:44,641
- I could have a boyfriend.
- You're by yourself at 7.30 in the morning.

28
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:47,241
- You're very observant.
- I'm a cop.

29
00:03:48,487 --> 00:03:51,399
Well then, I feel compelled to warn you,

30
00:03:52,327 --> 00:03:55,205
most of the guys I've dated recently
have died.

31
00:03:55,287 --> 00:03:57,164
- As in...
- Dead.

32
00:03:57,247 --> 00:03:59,807
- How?
- Various circumstances.

33
00:04:00,727 --> 00:04:02,843
I'll risk it.

34
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,086
How about dinner tonight?
My motel room.

35
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,965
- Your motel room.
- I'm in town from Denver on a case.

36
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:14,561
We'll order room service,
open a box of wine...

37
00:04:14,647 --> 00:04:18,276
- A box!
- Something with a duck on the front.

38
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:26,837
- Stop it, Pete.
- I'm on a roll here!

39
00:04:26,927 --> 00:04:29,361
I haven't even shown you my badge yet.

40
00:04:29,447 --> 00:04:32,007
Aw. And I gotta go.

41
00:04:32,087 --> 00:04:36,080
Come on, Sam, call in sick. Spend the day
with me. We'll go to the zoo.

42
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:39,159
There's no zoo in Colorado Springs.

43
00:04:39,247 --> 00:04:42,796
Bowling. There must be a bowling alley
around here somewhere.

44
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:47,199
- I have to work.
- Can't deep-space telemetry wait a day?

45
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,643
Have you seen how much deep space
there is out there?

46
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:56,321
I'll see you tonight.

47
00:05:03,847 --> 00:05:07,044
It jams the frequencies
the Goa'uld use for communication

48
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:09,960
and remote control of devices
like ring transporters.

49
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:14,404
Right now we're working on
making it portable enough to...

50
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:21,041
- At least pretend it's interesting.
- It's very interesting. Please go on.

51
00:05:21,127 --> 00:05:23,436
- Are you tired?
- You think?

52
00:05:23,527 --> 00:05:26,200
- I had the weirdest dream last night.
- About what?

53
00:05:26,287 --> 00:05:29,962
Working with Sarah back in Chicago,
before the Stargate programme.

54
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:32,083
How's that weird?

55
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:35,079
Things were all mixed up,
my hair was different...

56
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:37,158
Well...

57
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:41,602
No offence, but it's not like
you don't have some issues to work out.

58
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:44,440
- Oh, yeah.
- Maybe you should talk to someone.

59
00:05:44,527 --> 00:05:46,518
I thought I was.

60
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,483
- Colonel!
- Carter.

61
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:54,240
- Coffee.
- Talk to you later, OK?

62
00:06:09,527 --> 00:06:11,643
Humming?

63
00:06:11,727 --> 00:06:13,604
- I am?
- You are.

64
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:15,518
Sorry.

65
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:26,284
What's his name?
Humming.

66
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:29,006
Pete. Pete Shanahan.
He's a cop.

67
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:33,126
- Speeding again, are we?
- From Denver. A friend of my brother's.

68
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:35,084
- A setup.
- Pathetic, I know.

69
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:37,522
No, it's great.
Isn't it?

70
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:40,326
Well, it's not serious or anything.

71
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:43,479
And yet it is humworthy.

72
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:46,443
- Sir...
- It's none of my business.

73
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:52,124
I'm just happy you're happy about
something other than... quarks.

74
00:06:56,007 --> 00:06:59,602
- Not bad with the quarks, huh?
- Excellent.

75
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:06,160
- Bit uncomfortable, isn't it?
- Yeah, a bit.

76
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,636
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

77
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,196
Good morning.

78
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:07,278
Hm? Hello.

79
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:11,485
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you come in.
I mean, how are you?

80
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,717
- Fine.
- You settling in?

81
00:08:13,807 --> 00:08:17,880
Well, except for want of
a decent cup of tea, I'm in heaven.

82
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:20,925
That's good to hear.

83
00:08:22,407 --> 00:08:26,878
You know, I must have read
everything you've ever published.

84
00:08:28,647 --> 00:08:30,797
- Everything?
- Yes.

85
00:08:31,727 --> 00:08:33,718
What a waste of time.

86
00:08:33,807 --> 00:08:37,197
Please! Your theories on the Hyksos
dynasty are groundbreaking -

87
00:08:37,287 --> 00:08:39,278
if a little audacious.

88
00:08:39,367 --> 00:08:43,758
I found them inspiring. I referenced them
in my doctoral thesis at Cambridge.

89
00:08:44,807 --> 00:08:47,241
You must have failed.

90
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:52,117
I just hope I can live up
to such talented company.

91
00:08:52,207 --> 00:08:54,801
No, I'm sure if you're here,
you have... you are.

92
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:57,959
Stop. The flattery is overwhelming.

93
00:09:05,847 --> 00:09:09,556
- I should let you continue.
- I'm gonna continue.

94
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:19,640
You know, I know this good place
for coffee that...

95
00:09:19,727 --> 00:09:22,036
No, I mean, I'm sure they serve tea.

96
00:09:23,447 --> 00:09:26,962
- I'd like that, Dr Jackson.
- Daniel.

97
00:09:27,047 --> 00:09:29,038
Daniel.

98
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:34,760
I can't tell you how much I've looked
forward to being here with you,

99
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:37,281
being able to pick your brain and...

100
00:10:10,927 --> 00:10:14,078
- That was great.
- Yeah, it was OK.

101
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,283
I mean, the company was fine.

102
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,404
Oh, come on, how can you not like
Singin' in the Rain?

103
00:10:19,487 --> 00:10:22,001
I've always been
more of a Fred Astaire fan.

104
00:10:22,087 --> 00:10:24,999
- It's a classic.
- Whoa! Whoa there, lady.

105
00:10:25,087 --> 00:10:29,842
"Classic" is reserved for the likes of The
French Connection, Dirty Harry, Serpico.

106
00:10:29,927 --> 00:10:32,600
- Cop movies.
- What's your point?

107
00:10:32,687 --> 00:10:36,839
- This was romantic.
- Watching a man dance in the rain?

108
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,761
- Just cos there's no guns or car chases...
- Or nudity.

109
00:10:40,847 --> 00:10:44,965
Your chances of that
are slim to none now, buddy.

110
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:47,959
Have I ever told you
what a good dancer I am?

111
00:10:49,447 --> 00:10:51,756
My case down here wraps up tomorrow.

112
00:10:51,847 --> 00:10:53,917
You're heading back to Denver?

113
00:10:54,007 --> 00:10:59,559
I called my captain and said "I don't care
if crime is running rampant up there,

114
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:02,844
I met this woman, this amazing person,

115
00:11:03,727 --> 00:11:06,002
and we got this thing goin' on."

116
00:11:07,127 --> 00:11:11,405
- And what did he say?
- "Get your ass back here or you're fired."

117
00:11:12,087 --> 00:11:14,521
- Too bad.
- I'm lying.

118
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:18,964
I told him
I'm taking two weeks' vacation.

119
00:11:19,047 --> 00:11:22,835
The truth is, Colorado Springs is very...

120
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:26,358
underrated.

121
00:11:34,327 --> 00:11:36,238
Pete.

122
00:11:36,327 --> 00:11:39,125
- And it was going so well.
- It is.

123
00:11:39,207 --> 00:11:41,084
But?

124
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:45,079
- It's getting late.
- It's seven o'clock.

125
00:11:45,167 --> 00:11:47,761
I have to get up really early.

126
00:11:47,847 --> 00:11:50,156
- To go to work.
- Right.

127
00:11:51,327 --> 00:11:56,037
Which involves long, arduous hours
of you looking into a telescope.

128
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:58,402
Right.

129
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:03,083
Sam... have I mentioned I'm a cop?
I interrogate people for a living.

130
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:06,125
Are you saying you don't believe me?

131
00:12:06,207 --> 00:12:09,882
Is this all going too fast for you?
Cos I could back off.

132
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:14,437
Give you five or ten minutes?

133
00:12:20,727 --> 00:12:22,718
I'll call you.

134
00:12:24,967 --> 00:12:27,401
Have I left yet?

135
00:12:27,487 --> 00:12:29,603
I can't feel my legs.

136
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:52,558
- Thank you.
- A little human contact first, if you please.

137
00:12:58,607 --> 00:13:01,201
- Was that so hard?
- Mmm.

138
00:13:01,287 --> 00:13:03,278
I'll live.

139
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:08,202
- You've been here all night, haven't you?
- Is it morning already?

140
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,562
I've got something for you.

141
00:13:17,967 --> 00:13:19,719
Where'd you get this?

142
00:13:19,807 --> 00:13:22,765
It was found during
an expedition in Morocco.

143
00:13:22,847 --> 00:13:27,796
An associate sent it to me for analysis.
No one's quite sure what to make of it.

144
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:31,516
I took the liberty
of running a carbon dating.

145
00:13:31,607 --> 00:13:34,075
It's over 10,000 years old.

146
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:38,406
- That's impossible.
- The lack of writing in the pyramids,

147
00:13:38,487 --> 00:13:41,285
the inconclusive dating
on several artefacts...

148
00:13:41,367 --> 00:13:46,282
Are you saying this proves there existed a
language that predates all hieroglyphics?

149
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,279
I thought you might enjoy the challenge.

150
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:56,958
Daniel?

151
00:13:57,047 --> 00:14:00,881
- I recognise this.
- How could you?

152
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:05,438
Medieval Latin is a derivative.
We can use it as a reference point.

153
00:14:05,527 --> 00:14:08,280
Daniel, how could you
possibly know that?

154
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:10,517
I don't know.

155
00:14:10,607 --> 00:14:12,598
I just do.

156
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:30,280
This makes no sense.

157
00:14:30,367 --> 00:14:33,040
Maybe you should eat something.

158
00:14:34,167 --> 00:14:36,761
In the dream
the tablet was written in Ancient,

159
00:14:36,847 --> 00:14:38,883
and in the dream I could read Ancient.

160
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:42,880
That's not so odd, considering you can
also do that when you're awake.

161
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:45,686
Perhaps you want to
reveal something to yourself.

162
00:14:45,767 --> 00:14:48,235
- Like?
- From when you were ascended.

163
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:50,966
Your prior vision
of Bra'tac and Rya'c in danger.

164
00:14:51,047 --> 00:14:54,084
The tablet sounds a lot like
the one you found on Abydos.

165
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:57,523
- That was to lead to the Lost City.
- But didn't.

166
00:14:57,607 --> 00:15:01,316
You think I know the location
of the Lost City and I don't remember?

167
00:15:01,407 --> 00:15:05,798
If you have the dream again,
perhaps you should translate the tablet.

168
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:17,995
I thought you might need a break.

169
00:15:18,087 --> 00:15:19,918
Wow.

170
00:15:22,207 --> 00:15:25,199
That's really nice. I mean...

171
00:15:27,047 --> 00:15:29,880
- I don't really deserve you, do I?
- No.

172
00:15:30,967 --> 00:15:35,006
- Hungry?
- I can't remember the last time I ate.

173
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:37,601
- How's it going?
- I'm so close.

174
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,599
I think I found a basic structure
to the whole thing.

175
00:15:40,687 --> 00:15:42,678
It's about guidance.

176
00:15:42,767 --> 00:15:47,921
At first I thought that meant some sort of
spiritual guidance, but I was wrong. Here.

177
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,919
Look.

178
00:15:55,007 --> 00:15:58,841
Something about
a starting point or place of origin.

179
00:15:59,287 --> 00:16:01,926
The steps of a great journey leading to...

180
00:16:02,007 --> 00:16:04,919
What? Leading to what?

181
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:09,555
A city. A place of great power.

182
00:16:11,647 --> 00:16:16,880
It's a map, telling us how to find a city
where an ancient race of humans lived.

183
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:17,326
See, I know what the tablet
is supposed to say,

184
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:20,843
I just can't seem to finish translating it.

185
00:17:25,047 --> 00:17:30,360
Perhaps the location of the Lost City was
not the answer you were searching for.

186
00:17:30,447 --> 00:17:34,599
Since I now require sleep,
I have developed an interest in dreams.

187
00:17:34,687 --> 00:17:38,475
There is much research to study
on the matter.

188
00:17:41,407 --> 00:17:44,479
OK, Sigmund,
what are my dreams about?

189
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:51,607
Since Sarah was taken as a host by Osiris,
you have been unable to save her.

190
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:56,238
Perhaps that is the focus
of your subconscious desires.

191
00:17:56,327 --> 00:17:58,921
Something I knew
when I was ascended could help?

192
00:17:59,007 --> 00:18:03,125
Dreams are the mind's way of dealing
with desires that cannot be fulfilled.

193
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:08,042
Oh. So basically I'm destined
never to get a good night's sleep again.

194
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:11,199
Knowing your past experiences,
Daniel Jackson,

195
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:14,962
I do not know how
you have slept well before now.

196
00:18:15,047 --> 00:18:20,326
Thank you, Teal'c. This conversation
has been disturbing on many levels.

197
00:18:58,247 --> 00:19:01,319
- Up enough?
- I, uh...

198
00:19:03,847 --> 00:19:05,963
What?

199
00:19:06,047 --> 00:19:08,515
I'll take that as a yes.

200
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,121
- Are those for me?
- Yeah.

201
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:17,799
It's the other 11.
The one I left before makes a dozen.

202
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,004
I get it.
They're beautiful. Thank you.

203
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:33,518
- Can I open them now?
- No.

204
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:37,282
- Now?
- No! Will you stop?

205
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,358
- How about now?
- No.

206
00:19:39,447 --> 00:19:41,438
OK, now.

207
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:57,765
- What do you think?
- I think we're gonna get noticed.

208
00:19:57,847 --> 00:19:59,838
Come on.

209
00:20:30,127 --> 00:20:32,482
This is great.

210
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:38,358
It's nice to know people still stay together
no matter what. Isn't it?

211
00:20:58,127 --> 00:21:00,243
- I can't do this.
- What's the matter?

212
00:21:00,327 --> 00:21:02,363
I'm just going round in circles.

213
00:21:02,447 --> 00:21:06,235
I can't find any references
that relate to this passage.

214
00:21:06,327 --> 00:21:09,399
- Doorways?
- What?

215
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:11,603
The origin of doorways.

216
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,724
- How do you know that?
- It makes sense, doesn't it?

217
00:21:14,807 --> 00:21:18,766
- Yeah, but how do you know that?
- It's all there.

218
00:21:18,847 --> 00:21:20,838
You just need to relax.

219
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:27,599
- Mm! Oh, no.
- What?

220
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:31,521
We were supposed to have dinner tonight.
Two months, right?

221
00:21:31,607 --> 00:21:34,167
I'm so sorry, I forgot.
Why didn't you remind me?

222
00:21:34,247 --> 00:21:37,000
- It's all right.
- It's too late now.

223
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:41,365
I understand. If it was that important
to me, I would have said something.

224
00:21:41,447 --> 00:21:44,359
- You don't mind?
- Of course not.

225
00:21:45,527 --> 00:21:48,644
You're supposed to leave.

226
00:21:48,727 --> 00:21:52,117
What are you talking about?
I'm not going anywhere.

227
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:55,597
Your research will change the world.
You're a brilliant mind.

228
00:21:55,687 --> 00:21:59,362
I don't want to stand in the way of that.
I want to be a part of it.

229
00:22:00,007 --> 00:22:03,920
I am, however, going to order us pizza.

230
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:08,997
Get back to work.

231
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,956
So, do you wanna come in?

232
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:21,041
I don't know. Seeing the inside
of your house, that's a pretty big step.

233
00:22:21,127 --> 00:22:25,564
- Suit yourself.
- Right now, you're pretty much perfect.

234
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:30,879
What if it turns out
you're really messy, or worse,

235
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:36,200
you're a neat-freak weirdo with labelled
drawers and an alphabetised bookshelf?

236
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:38,278
Pff.

237
00:22:45,007 --> 00:22:46,235
OK, I'm coming!

238
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:06,160
Wow.

239
00:23:06,247 --> 00:23:09,523
- Just don't look at the bookshelf.
- OK.

240
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:22,122
So why'd you become a cop?

241
00:23:22,207 --> 00:23:24,562
I watched too much TV as a kid.

242
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:28,843
Adam-12, Starsky and Hutch,
Barney Miller.

243
00:23:30,007 --> 00:23:33,795
- Barney Miller?
- It was my favourite show.

244
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:37,879
Those guys never shot anybody,
never beat anybody up.

245
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:40,037
That's it?

246
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,756
What do you think? Every cop out there
has an inspirational story?

247
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,838
It's just a job, Sam.

248
00:23:46,847 --> 00:23:49,566
I don't think so. Not for you.

249
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:54,164
And Mark told me you had a story.

250
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:57,598
Bastard!

251
00:23:57,687 --> 00:24:01,396
- Never date your buddy's sister.
- He didn't tell me what it was.

252
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:05,605
It's no big deal. I... had a bit of
a rough time when I was growing up.

253
00:24:09,007 --> 00:24:10,998
Truth is,

254
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:18,323
I probably would have ended up in jail if
it wasn't for one cop who took an interest.

255
00:24:19,487 --> 00:24:23,844
He really made a difference in my life,
and I admired that.

256
00:24:24,767 --> 00:24:28,521
- It's an admirable job.
- Well, my ex-wife didn't think so.

257
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:34,001
Did you see the episode where Barney
gets home and his stuff is on the lawn,

258
00:24:34,087 --> 00:24:37,079
- with divorce papers stapled on top?
- No.

259
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:40,238
I didn't blame her.

260
00:24:41,167 --> 00:24:44,955
I mean, the hours suck
and you never know if...

261
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:49,122
I didn't have a choice.

262
00:24:50,407 --> 00:24:52,841
It's who I am.

263
00:24:53,927 --> 00:24:56,646
- I can understand that.
- Really?

264
00:24:58,207 --> 00:25:03,361
- Deep-space telemetry is who you are?
- I wish I could tell you more.

265
00:25:03,887 --> 00:25:07,880
- You don't trust me.
- I'm not allowed.

266
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:14,197
Where are you going?

267
00:25:15,407 --> 00:25:18,399
I gotta drive back to Denver today
and file my report.

268
00:25:18,487 --> 00:25:23,607
Pete... aside from getting
into huge trouble myself,

269
00:25:23,687 --> 00:25:25,837
I could be putting you in danger.

270
00:25:25,927 --> 00:25:30,762
Now you're telling me that joke about your
boyfriends all ending up dead is true?

271
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:32,724
Pete, please.

272
00:25:36,407 --> 00:25:40,400
The problem is, I feel like I've just
scratched the surface with you, Sam.

273
00:25:42,087 --> 00:25:47,764
How can we have a future together
if you won't share your life with me?

274
00:26:28,327 --> 00:26:31,637
Federal Bureau of Investigation.
How may I direct your call?

275
00:26:31,727 --> 00:26:36,562
- Special Agent Farrity, please.
- I'll transfer you now. Please hold.

276
00:26:40,327 --> 00:26:42,079
- Farrity.
- Dave, it's Pete.

277
00:26:42,167 --> 00:26:43,839
What's up, buddy?

278
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:48,963
I'm in Colorado Springs on a case
right now and I need a favour, man.

279
00:26:49,047 --> 00:26:51,163
Can you do a background check
on someone?

280
00:26:51,247 --> 00:26:55,684
- Global agency search, the works?
- Sure thing. Who is it?

281
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:58,406
An air-force major.

282
00:26:58,487 --> 00:27:00,478
Samantha Carter.

283
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,916
The only thing I don't have
is a gate address,

284
00:27:12,007 --> 00:27:14,885
and there are still a few passages
I can't translate.

285
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:17,356
- Do you think you can?
- I don't know.

286
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:22,282
It's like I'm not in control,
like I'm just along for the ride,

287
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:24,961
watching the whole thing unfold.

288
00:27:25,047 --> 00:27:31,282
- The strange thing is, none of it's right.
- Please elaborate, Daniel Jackson.

289
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:33,358
I was an idiot.

290
00:27:33,447 --> 00:27:37,804
Sarah was in love with me
and I had feelings for her too, but...

291
00:27:37,887 --> 00:27:42,039
my obsession with my research
destroyed our relationship.

292
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:47,281
She finally broke it off with me
when I worked through our anniversary.

293
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:51,402
The Sarah I'm dreaming about is different.

294
00:27:51,487 --> 00:27:53,842
She cares about my work
as much as I do.

295
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:57,078
She wants me to find the Lost City
as much as I do.

296
00:27:57,167 --> 00:27:59,635
Sounds like a normal male fantasy to me.

297
00:27:59,727 --> 00:28:03,845
Did you not say that Sarah introduced the
tablet to you during one of the dreams?

298
00:28:03,927 --> 00:28:06,999
And that you feel that
you have no control of the dreams?

299
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:09,203
- Yeah.
- Teal'c?

300
00:28:10,727 --> 00:28:15,755
The Goa'uld possess the technology
to explore one's memory.

301
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:21,365
You're suggesting Osiris is here on Earth,
manipulating Dr Jackson's dreams?

302
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:24,405
- We think it's possible, sir.
- Kinky!

303
00:28:24,487 --> 00:28:28,639
She's looking for the location
of the Lost City in my subconscious.

304
00:28:28,727 --> 00:28:32,003
She's implanted an image
of an Ancient tablet to help me.

305
00:28:32,087 --> 00:28:36,478
Osiris can access Sarah's memories and
use them to gain Daniel Jackson's trust.

306
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:39,161
- How's she doing it?
- We're speculating that

307
00:28:39,247 --> 00:28:43,035
she's sneaking into Daniel's house
at night and using a memory device.

308
00:28:43,127 --> 00:28:47,643
Anubis probed Thor's mind, thus gaining
access to Asgard beaming technology.

309
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,241
That'd allow her
to come and go undetected.

310
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:55,560
Why not just snatch up Dr Jackson and
use a mind probe on him, like with Thor?

311
00:28:55,647 --> 00:28:59,117
It's possible Anubis's mind probe
won't work on the subconscious.

312
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:02,324
It might have something to do
with how Oma erased my memories.

313
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,958
It may be a way to get you to unknowingly
help them learn what they wish to know.

314
00:29:07,047 --> 00:29:09,720
So what do we do?

315
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:12,480
The Goa'uld
are scavengers of alien technology.

316
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:16,162
They would interface any Asgard system
with their own command device.

317
00:29:16,247 --> 00:29:18,807
We hope the jamming device
could prevent Osiris

318
00:29:18,887 --> 00:29:21,685
from using the beam technology
to escape Daniel's room.

319
00:29:21,767 --> 00:29:23,997
- You want to set up a trap.
- We won't spring it

320
00:29:24,087 --> 00:29:27,841
until after she's helped me remember
the location of the Lost City.

321
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,320
What?!

322
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:35,356
Look, no one wants to save Sarah
more than I do, but... I could know.

323
00:29:35,447 --> 00:29:39,884
I mean, it could be there.
Somewhere in my subconscious.

324
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:42,765
We let her think she's operating
without our knowledge

325
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,236
until I've had a chance
to try to finish this.

326
00:29:45,327 --> 00:29:48,364
And how are we supposed to know
when you know,

327
00:29:48,447 --> 00:29:51,996
if it's all happening in your head
while you're sleeping?

328
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:58,677
- I don't know.
- You'd better figure it out.

329
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:04,160
We can't risk letting Osiris escape
with that kind of information.

330
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:10,606
- Shanahan.
- It's me. I got what you wanted.

331
00:30:11,327 --> 00:30:14,922
- Just give me the highlights.
- Well, there's a lot of backstop ID.

332
00:30:15,007 --> 00:30:18,204
Works for the air force,
does deep-space telemetry for NORAD.

333
00:30:18,287 --> 00:30:21,802
- Is that all you found?
- It's what didn't turn up that says most.

334
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:24,037
The backstop dead-ends.

335
00:30:24,127 --> 00:30:26,118
- She's been scrubbed?
- Yeah.

336
00:30:26,207 --> 00:30:28,767
Someone wiped out
every possible trace of her.

337
00:30:28,847 --> 00:30:31,520
Left only what they want others to see.

338
00:30:31,607 --> 00:30:34,565
She's probably connected
with some top-level stuff.

339
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,761
- Like?
- Black ops, covert units.

340
00:30:37,847 --> 00:30:41,203
Things the government denies
all knowledge of, you know?

341
00:30:41,287 --> 00:30:45,883
Look, Pete, you ask me, this Major
Carter's connected to something big.

342
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:50,324
You might want to back off from this one,
OK, buddy? It's way out of your league.

343
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:52,637
It's not like I'm dating her or anything.

344
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:55,841
Right.

345
00:31:31,127 --> 00:31:32,526
- Hello.
- Hi, it's me.

346
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:36,759
This is Pete. I'm probably chasing
a bad guy. Leave a message.

347
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,964
So what do we got?

348
00:31:42,047 --> 00:31:45,244
Daniel's at his house,
setting up video surveillance.

349
00:31:45,327 --> 00:31:47,841
Teal'c's picking out his doughnuts.

350
00:31:47,927 --> 00:31:51,124
He loves a good stakeout.

351
00:31:51,207 --> 00:31:55,598
Jamming device is in the van. It should
prevent Osiris from beaming herself out.

352
00:31:55,687 --> 00:31:58,645
- We take her down with these?
- She likely has a shield,

353
00:31:58,727 --> 00:32:00,957
but a tranquilliser dart will get through.

354
00:32:01,047 --> 00:32:04,676
Then we hope the Tok'ra can safely
remove the symbiote and save Sarah.

355
00:32:04,767 --> 00:32:09,966
- What about this whole Lost City deal?
- We watch and see.

356
00:32:10,047 --> 00:32:12,607
Once in his room,
Osiris won't be able to leave.

357
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:16,316
We just have to get to her
before she realises she's been made.

358
00:32:16,407 --> 00:32:19,558
- Backup?
- Local authorities have been "notified".

359
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:23,037
But we don't want to do anything
to alert Osiris.

360
00:32:24,087 --> 00:32:26,317
How's Pete?

361
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:31,278
You know how it is.

362
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:37,879
Usually you don't let it bother you, cos
they couldn't cope with the truth anyway.

363
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:40,037
Usually.

364
00:32:41,967 --> 00:32:43,958
I think he could have.

365
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,356
Hey, Daniel.

366
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:10,361
Daniel, are you sleeping yet?

367
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,120
Yes, Jack, I'm fast asleep.

368
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:44,718
What do you got there?

369
00:33:46,887 --> 00:33:49,481
No. I'll pass.

370
00:33:57,727 --> 00:33:59,365
Here we go.

371
00:34:02,087 --> 00:34:04,999
Activating frequency jamming.

372
00:34:10,127 --> 00:34:12,118
Let's do it.

373
00:34:56,967 --> 00:34:59,686
- Carter?
- She's still there, sir.

374
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:04,045
- How long do we wait?
- Daniel must be getting close.

375
00:35:17,327 --> 00:35:19,557
- Progress?
- Not really.

376
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:24,765
These symbols represent
the location of the city.

377
00:35:24,847 --> 00:35:26,917
- Like an address?
- Yeah.

378
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:32,365
Yeah, there's seven of them. They won't
translate into anything specific.

379
00:35:32,447 --> 00:35:35,280
- You're so close.
- No, I am not.

380
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,358
Don't say that, Daniel.

381
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:45,042
- They mean nothing to me.
- You've worked too hard to give up now.

382
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:47,118
I don't know.

383
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:50,761
I never knew.

384
00:35:55,447 --> 00:35:58,644
How unfortunate for you.

385
00:36:03,127 --> 00:36:04,845
Move in! Move in!

386
00:36:33,327 --> 00:36:36,046
- Sam.
- Pete, what are you...

387
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:38,357
Get down!

388
00:36:46,007 --> 00:36:47,725
Holy...

389
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:54,843
Agh!

390
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:59,717
- Will you be all right, Daniel Jackson?
- Yeah. Go, go, go.

391
00:37:07,727 --> 00:37:10,605
- It's no use, Pete!
- Yeah, why is that?

392
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:21,038
Now that is not normal.

393
00:37:22,047 --> 00:37:24,038
Look out!

394
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:54,478
Clear!

395
00:37:56,367 --> 00:37:58,722
- Are you OK?
- I'm OK.

396
00:37:58,807 --> 00:38:00,798
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

397
00:38:01,807 --> 00:38:03,798
That's good.

398
00:38:10,527 --> 00:38:12,643
Oh, God. Pete, you've been hit.

399
00:38:12,727 --> 00:38:14,445
Have I?

400
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:19,605
- Carter?
- It's Pete. He needs an ambulance.

401
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,806
Just hang in there, OK?

402
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:28,766
Sam... what just happened?

403
00:38:29,167 --> 00:38:32,955
I promise, if you make it through this,
I will explain everything.

404
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:36,282
Deal.

405
00:38:57,247 --> 00:38:59,477
It's all right, you're safe.

406
00:38:59,567 --> 00:39:01,876
- Daniel?
- I'm here.

407
00:39:03,487 --> 00:39:05,478
It's all over.

408
00:39:06,367 --> 00:39:08,881
You're free.

409
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:11,959
- I'm so sorry.
- Shh.

410
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:15,238
It's not your fault.

411
00:39:15,327 --> 00:39:17,397
I couldn't stop it.

412
00:39:17,887 --> 00:39:20,321
We're gonna get you through this.

413
00:39:29,847 --> 00:39:31,519
Hey.

414
00:39:31,607 --> 00:39:34,405
- Are they treating you OK?
- Yeah.

415
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:37,796
Who'd have thought
there was a hospital here?

416
00:39:37,887 --> 00:39:41,323
- One of the best anywhere.
- This place is unbelievable.

417
00:39:42,247 --> 00:39:44,966
You have no idea.

418
00:39:59,487 --> 00:40:01,478
Thanks.

419
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:13,362
I believe I lived up
to my end of the bargain.

420
00:40:15,647 --> 00:40:18,002
What I'm about to tell you is classified

421
00:40:18,087 --> 00:40:21,636
under section 11-C-9
of the National Security Act.

422
00:40:21,727 --> 00:40:26,926
Chicks with laser-beam rings and
glowing eyes are classified under 11-C-9?

423
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,805
- Let me talk, will you?
- OK.

424
00:40:29,887 --> 00:40:35,245
You're currently in a top-secret military
facility known as Stargate Command.

425
00:40:35,327 --> 00:40:39,286
In 1928 in Giza, Egypt, archaeologists
unearthed an ancient device

426
00:40:39,367 --> 00:40:43,519
capable of transportation to other planets
by means of a subspace wormhole.

427
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:49,284
I knew it! This is way better than
a box of wine with a duck on the front.

428
00:40:49,367 --> 00:40:51,483
I'm not kidding.

429
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:54,283
Sorry.

430
00:40:54,367 --> 00:40:56,642
Other planets. Wormholes.

431
00:40:58,447 --> 00:41:00,961
Continue.
