1
00:00:06,447 --> 00:00:08,802
- You getting the full thing?
- Just about.

2
00:00:08,887 --> 00:00:13,642
Instead of zooming out, pull back.
Get it in context. Just keep going back.

3
00:00:13,727 --> 00:00:15,638
- It's cool.
- It's amazing.

4
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:20,596
Yes, it is. Mr Bregman? Colonel Tom
Rundell, Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

5
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,759
- Public Affairs Liaison.
- That's a mouthful. Call me Emmett.

6
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:25,803
- Yes, sir.
- Is that OK?

7
00:00:25,887 --> 00:00:29,675
- This is my posse here...
- Tech Sergeant Dale James.

8
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:32,076
- Shep Wickenhouse.
- Shep's doing sound.

9
00:00:32,167 --> 00:00:36,718
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
But what are you doing here?

10
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:41,039
We're getting some establishing shots,
the first of many, while we're waiting.

11
00:00:41,127 --> 00:00:43,243
In fact, we should get a shot of you.

12
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:47,764
Sorry, you're not authorized until
you're briefed by General Hammond.

13
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:51,556
I've already been briefed - Tom, is it? -
by the Defence Department.

14
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:55,799
What's the problem? I'm cleared to shoot.
Maybe you guys haven't been cleared.

15
00:00:55,887 --> 00:01:00,005
- What's the problem?
- General Hammond will see you now.

16
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:01,315
OK.

17
00:01:04,407 --> 00:01:05,965
- This should be fun.
- Oh, yeah.

18
00:01:06,047 --> 00:01:11,997
- General Hammond? This is Mr Bregman.
- I'm very excited to be here, sir.

19
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:19,685
You may find that we're not all as giddy as
you are about this project, Mr Bregman.

20
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,564
Giddy?

21
00:01:23,847 --> 00:01:27,044
I'm personally and professionally excited,

22
00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:30,119
I think I said excited, to be here, General.

23
00:01:30,207 --> 00:01:33,517
I haven't been giddy since, well,
you don't want to know.

24
00:01:33,607 --> 00:01:36,679
No. I just want to be
as clear as I can up front.

25
00:01:36,767 --> 00:01:39,759
- Sure.
- Your presence is highly unorthodox.

26
00:01:39,847 --> 00:01:44,557
I will not let it threaten the security of
any missions or the safety of my people.

27
00:01:44,647 --> 00:01:51,359
I've already been frisked three times, we
can make it four. Do it if you want. Sorry.

28
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:55,645
I consider it my responsibility
to protect my people's interests.

29
00:01:55,727 --> 00:01:58,366
Frankly, I feel it's appropriate to warn you

30
00:01:58,447 --> 00:02:02,565
that no one around here wants
to be part of your little reality show.

31
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:03,716
Oh.

32
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,924
I see. You know, General...

33
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:12,639
you're probably aware that there were
film cameras on the beaches of Normandy

34
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:17,084
decades before Survivor debuted on CBS.

35
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:22,287
I think it's outrageous that the Stargate
programme hasn't been chronicled.

36
00:02:22,367 --> 00:02:26,758
Because it's top secret. Only a handful
of people will see anything you shoot.

37
00:02:26,847 --> 00:02:29,839
So far, General. So far.

38
00:02:29,927 --> 00:02:34,523
Eventually, inevitably, this programme
is gonna be disclosed to the world.

39
00:02:34,607 --> 00:02:37,838
And I think this film we're doing
might in some way provide

40
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:42,318
insight into what's really been
going on here for the last six years.

41
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:45,285
What's really been going on?

42
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:48,558
You know what, General?

43
00:02:48,647 --> 00:02:52,162
I respect what you're doing.
I even respect that you want me out.

44
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:57,116
But the President of the United States
invited me to do this.

45
00:02:58,007 --> 00:03:00,237
You see that red phone?

46
00:03:00,327 --> 00:03:03,239
You wouldn't be here if he hadn't.

47
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:10,237
Well, then, I hope I can expect the full
cooperation of you and your personnel.

48
00:03:10,327 --> 00:03:15,401
- To the letter of these orders.
- To the letter. I see. I see. Thank you.

49
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:18,126
You have high expectations to meet.

50
00:03:22,487 --> 00:03:24,284
General.

51
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:33,684
Maybe it's just my opinion,
but, to me, throughout history,

52
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:36,918
the best documentaries
take a cinéma vérité approach.

53
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:42,445
- Let the subject tell its own story.
- That's a very interesting point of view.

54
00:04:42,527 --> 00:04:45,280
And mostly, if not totally, crap.

55
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:49,280
Especially in a situation like this.
If this story was gonna tell itself,

56
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:53,679
there'd be Stargate updates
on the nightly news. You do have a point.

57
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:57,316
We should make people feel comfortable,
gain their trust.

58
00:04:57,407 --> 00:05:02,527
You know what? We'd be here a year.
These soldiers conceal things for a living.

59
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:05,883
- Airmen, sir.
- These airmen conceal things for a living.

60
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:09,846
The only way to get anything
out of them is not by the... Look at that.

61
00:05:09,927 --> 00:05:12,202
...by the cinéma vérité approach.

62
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:15,802
It's gonna be by
the wringing-it-out-of-them approach.

63
00:05:15,887 --> 00:05:19,675
Look, Mr Bregman. You are here
strictly to document what is going on.

64
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:22,998
Not to pursue anything prejudicial
to Air Force personnel.

65
00:05:23,087 --> 00:05:25,760
- Call me Emmett.
- If someone were to say something...

66
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:29,362
- Is that who I think it is?
- It's Colonel Jack O'Neill.

67
00:05:29,447 --> 00:05:31,642
I like vanilla over chocolate,

68
00:05:31,727 --> 00:05:35,003
my favourite colour is peridot,
Tibet should be free,

69
00:05:35,087 --> 00:05:39,319
and if I could have dinner with anyone
in the world it'd be Mary Steenburgen.

70
00:05:39,407 --> 00:05:41,602
- Mary Steenburgen?
- She's nice.

71
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:43,917
I'm just trying to get a minute with you.

72
00:05:44,007 --> 00:05:47,124
I really don't have time.
I've got a briefing to go to.

73
00:05:47,207 --> 00:05:49,277
I understand. I'm Emmett Br...

74
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:54,637
No, look. I'm not gonna get a perspective
on this Stargate programme without you.

75
00:05:54,727 --> 00:05:56,957
So, when is a good time for you?

76
00:05:57,047 --> 00:06:00,119
Any time's good. Just send me a memo.

77
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:03,599
Memo.

78
00:06:03,807 --> 00:06:05,365
Memo.

79
00:06:05,887 --> 00:06:08,924
Really sensed he's starting to trust you.

80
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:17,436
Don't worry about it.
He only looks unprofessional.

81
00:06:17,527 --> 00:06:21,998
General Hammond warned me people
might be less than enthusiastic about this.

82
00:06:22,087 --> 00:06:25,397
We did have a bad experience
with a TV crew last year.

83
00:06:25,487 --> 00:06:27,796
The Prometheus incident.

84
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:32,403
I know that the Air Force insisted
on their own crew for that reason.

85
00:06:32,487 --> 00:06:37,242
You might be sensing reluctance from
people to put themselves on a pedestal.

86
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:39,204
We are just doing our jobs.

87
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:42,279
Just a job? Consider it my job
to put you on a pedestal.

88
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,676
This job looks to me to be extraordinary,

89
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:49,204
and, from what I read in your file, the
same can be said about you personally.

90
00:06:49,287 --> 00:06:52,359
- See, now I'm blushing.
- So you are.

91
00:06:52,447 --> 00:06:55,519
Then we should start.
It'll look good on camera.

92
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:58,804
Let's go, guys. Are you ready?

93
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:00,684
No.

94
00:07:02,007 --> 00:07:05,522
You don't need a light meter,
the woman is glowing.

95
00:07:05,607 --> 00:07:07,404
Let's get rolling.

96
00:07:07,487 --> 00:07:09,398
- We're rolling.
- Sound?

97
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:11,079
Rolling.

98
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,600
OK.

99
00:07:13,287 --> 00:07:16,085
Major Samantha Carter. US Air Force.

100
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:20,001
Astrophysicist. Considered
the foremost expert on the Stargate.

101
00:07:20,087 --> 00:07:24,285
You've explored territory
that no one on Earth has ever seen

102
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:30,363
and you've fought an enemy
that no one on Earth has even imagined.

103
00:07:31,207 --> 00:07:34,005
Major Samantha Carter.

104
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:39,081
Meet the six and a half billion people
of the planet Earth.

105
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,119
Hi.

106
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:48,085
I don't think I've ever asked
this question before,

107
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:53,685
- but what was it like to be, well, dead?
- I wasn't exactly dead.

108
00:07:53,767 --> 00:07:56,406
You, what's the word, transcended?

109
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,717
Ascended. Yeah.

110
00:07:58,807 --> 00:08:02,880
Well, actually I did have the
unfortunate experience of dying first.

111
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:06,596
Slowly and quite painfully first,
I might add.

112
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:10,123
In your file it says "Your human body"...
I'm quoting here.

113
00:08:10,207 --> 00:08:12,562
"Your human body
transformed into energy."

114
00:08:12,647 --> 00:08:16,959
"A bright white light rose above
the hospital bed." Is that...

115
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,766
- Yeah.
...accurate? So, could you...

116
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:24,079
Dr Jackson, could you,
I don't know, elaborate?

117
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,397
What did it feel like?

118
00:08:26,487 --> 00:08:31,117
I don't know. I really don't
remember much after that.

119
00:08:31,207 --> 00:08:33,437
Will you excuse me?

120
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:35,722
Follow him. Come on, come on.

121
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,479
Move.

122
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,558
Move! Move!

123
00:08:43,327 --> 00:08:45,318
Dr Jackson!

124
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,564
What is it? What is it?

125
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:51,559
- The mask fragment...
- Sorry, could you slow down?

126
00:08:51,647 --> 00:08:57,358
The mask fragment from P3X-298 was
dated to predynastic Egypt here on Earth.

127
00:08:57,447 --> 00:09:00,120
Could you get a close shot of this?
What is the...

128
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:03,279
What is the significance of that?

129
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,801
It's fascinating.

130
00:09:05,887 --> 00:09:08,765
It's... OK, you can back up. Back up.

131
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:12,923
That's it? It's fascinating?

132
00:09:13,007 --> 00:09:15,396
Why were we running?

133
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,164
Oh.

134
00:09:18,247 --> 00:09:21,239
I just wanted to see if you'd chase me.

135
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:26,558
OK, turn it off. Turn it off.
Get that mike away from me. Turn it off.

136
00:09:28,647 --> 00:09:32,720
Kevlar will not stop the energy blast
from a staff weapon.

137
00:09:32,807 --> 00:09:38,837
The plating in other bulletproof protection
gets superheated from the plasma.

138
00:09:38,927 --> 00:09:41,999
While it would stop the penetration,

139
00:09:42,087 --> 00:09:47,719
the wearer is trapped in what becomes
their own personal microwave oven.

140
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:53,086
Not a good idea. Anyway,
what we've been working on is this.

141
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:59,117
A ceramic polymer which will
resist the heat, stop the blast, and...

142
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:02,836
fits into a standard-issue SG vest.

143
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:07,318
Which Sergeant Siler
will now demonstrate for us.

144
00:10:07,407 --> 00:10:10,683
Wouldn't it be a better...
No, don't shoot me, shoot him.

145
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:16,797
Don't you think it would be
more interesting... if I wore the vest?

146
00:10:16,887 --> 00:10:19,355
- No. No, no, no.
- Isn't it safe?

147
00:10:19,447 --> 00:10:21,961
Absolutely.
It's not like we've never done it.

148
00:10:22,047 --> 00:10:24,641
Away from the face, big guy.

149
00:10:29,207 --> 00:10:31,084
It's all good. I'm fine.

150
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:35,276
You see, um... Yeah.
See, he does that all the time.

151
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:38,882
The control room is sort of like
the air-traffic control tower.

152
00:10:38,967 --> 00:10:41,322
We monitor all gate activity from here.

153
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:46,845
So, what are all these blinking
lights about? What are those lights there?

154
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:52,923
This monitors the power consumption
required to generate outgoing wormholes.

155
00:10:54,247 --> 00:11:00,720
Interestingly, we found our gate draws
10% more wattage than offworld gates.

156
00:11:00,807 --> 00:11:04,595
That far exceeds any potential loss
due to our man-made interface.

157
00:11:04,687 --> 00:11:09,715
We think it's the way the superconductive
crystals inside absorb electrical energy.

158
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:13,880
But we're also trying to demonstrate
that the DHDs are somehow producing

159
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:17,277
a purer, more efficient form of power.

160
00:11:20,927 --> 00:11:23,919
Could we get a shot of the gate spinning?

161
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:27,761
Sure. It's really cool.
Steam comes out of it and everything.

162
00:11:27,847 --> 00:11:30,441
- Great.
- Major.

163
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:36,166
Sorry, guys. An SG team's
due to embark on a mission.

164
00:11:36,247 --> 00:11:39,637
That's great.
We'll get a shot of them leaving.

165
00:11:39,727 --> 00:11:42,366
Actually, you're gonna have to leave.

166
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:47,996
Could I ask you something? Are you...
You can stop shooting. Cut.

167
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,967
OK, Balinsky, which way?

168
00:12:01,047 --> 00:12:04,562
- That way.
- I'll take point.

169
00:12:04,647 --> 00:12:08,925
Wells, Bosworth, you're rearguard.
Five-meter spread. Keep your eyes open.

170
00:12:09,007 --> 00:12:13,797
The MALP showed no indication of any
recent Goa'uld activity on this planet.

171
00:12:13,887 --> 00:12:16,799
I don't see any indication
of anything here.

172
00:12:16,887 --> 00:12:19,401
Take the usual bet on that, sir?

173
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:23,162
- Sure. Wells?
- An abandoned naqahdah mine.

174
00:12:23,247 --> 00:12:25,886
Boring. Good odds. Bosworth?

175
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:28,037
I'm gonna put my money on trees, sir.

176
00:12:28,127 --> 00:12:32,837
Bosworth's disqualified for being
a smart ass. I'll go with two-headed aliens.

177
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:35,760
Hostile or friendly, sir?

178
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:38,202
One head good, one head bad.

179
00:12:38,287 --> 00:12:39,515
Balinsky?

180
00:12:39,607 --> 00:12:41,598
Ruins of an ancient city.

181
00:12:41,687 --> 00:12:44,281
Yeah. You wish.

182
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:52,204
All night screaming. Projectile vomiting.

183
00:12:52,287 --> 00:12:55,916
Nuclear diapers. You have no idea.

184
00:12:56,007 --> 00:13:00,444
The reason they make 'em so cute is
so you don't suffocate 'em in their sleep.

185
00:13:00,527 --> 00:13:05,442
- Sir, you have four kids.
- Why do you think I enjoy work so much?

186
00:13:06,527 --> 00:13:10,679
Don't get me wrong. I love the little
buggers to death, but trust me...

187
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:16,763
it makes going through a Stargate and
facing alien bad guys look like nothing.

188
00:13:18,007 --> 00:13:21,556
- This is relaxing.
- Then why'd you have four?

189
00:13:23,567 --> 00:13:26,639
One's pretty bad. But you figure...

190
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:31,357
you gotta have two so the little guy
can have a brother or sister, right?

191
00:13:31,447 --> 00:13:34,837
Then you have two boys,
and the wife says she wants a girl.

192
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:38,715
You figure, hell, three can't be
much worse than two, right?

193
00:13:38,807 --> 00:13:42,925
What you don't realize is
your brain is fried cos you haven't slept.

194
00:13:43,007 --> 00:13:46,283
After three, four is no big deal.
You're so deep in.

195
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,484
Nothing seems to matter any more.
It's chaos.

196
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:54,004
You're just trying to make it through
each day alive. And in the end...

197
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:57,966
you spend all the energy you have left
trying to get 'em into bed.

198
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:03,440
Only to lie awake,
praying they don't get hooked on drugs.

199
00:14:04,367 --> 00:14:09,157
Or hurt. Or worse,
wind up dead in an alley somewhere.

200
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:14,158
- I can't wait, sir.
- Miracle of birth, my ass.

201
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:19,196
I'll tell you what a miracle is.
Birth control that works.

202
00:14:24,647 --> 00:14:26,444
Well, I'll be damned.

203
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:35,403
I win.

204
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:42,881
Sir.

205
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:45,435
Did you do your interview yet?

206
00:14:45,527 --> 00:14:47,438
Yeah.

207
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:49,961
Mary Steenburgen?

208
00:14:50,047 --> 00:14:52,038
She's so hot.

209
00:14:52,887 --> 00:14:56,038
Can you tell me the reason
for this documentary again?

210
00:14:56,127 --> 00:15:01,838
Didn't you read the memo? Officially, it's
for the 1,000th trip through the Stargate,

211
00:15:01,927 --> 00:15:04,919
- but I think there's more to it.
- One thousand?

212
00:15:05,007 --> 00:15:08,079
I know. Hard to believe
we've been at it this long.

213
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,681
There should be a cake.

214
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:12,758
Wait, um...

215
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:14,724
Dr Jackson, I just gotta...

216
00:15:14,807 --> 00:15:19,927
"Your memory was erased
when you returned to..."

217
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:22,043
I'm quoting here.

218
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:24,197
..."human form".

219
00:15:24,287 --> 00:15:28,917
That sounds completely idiotic.
Make a note, I have to reask that question.

220
00:15:29,007 --> 00:15:32,841
Sorry. Could you...?
What can you tell us about all that?

221
00:15:32,927 --> 00:15:35,202
Not much.

222
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:42,921
OK. Well, can you tell us a little bit
about what things were like before that?

223
00:15:43,007 --> 00:15:48,161
Thankfully I have most of those memories
back. There are still a few holes.

224
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,044
OK.

225
00:15:52,247 --> 00:15:57,526
"The pharaohs of the fourth dynasty
did not build the pyramids."

226
00:15:57,607 --> 00:16:00,963
No, they didn't. They're landing pads
for Goa'uld motherships.

227
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:04,835
I'm quoting from a speech you made
before your introduction to the Stargate.

228
00:16:04,927 --> 00:16:09,876
I presume that you knew nothing about
landing platforms or motherships, right?

229
00:16:09,967 --> 00:16:13,755
- Right. No.
- Until you met Catherine Langford.

230
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,726
- Right.
- And she introduced you to the Stargate.

231
00:16:17,807 --> 00:16:19,684
Right.

232
00:16:20,567 --> 00:16:22,159
So.

233
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:24,998
Why?

234
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:27,078
Why what?

235
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:33,926
- Why did she do that?
- I don't know. You'd have to ask her.

236
00:16:37,207 --> 00:16:40,358
OK, maybe I'll ask her.
Where is she? Is she transcended?

237
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:45,316
- Or ascended, or something like that?
- No, retired, actually. But...

238
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,398
you never know.

239
00:16:51,327 --> 00:16:54,125
So I'm just reading your file here.

240
00:16:54,207 --> 00:16:59,600
It's fascinating. I should ask you
immediately here... You're an alien?

241
00:17:00,487 --> 00:17:04,685
I mean, well, not to you.
To us, you would be...

242
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:11,718
Anyway, you were the highest-ranking
officer in the service of our alien enemies.

243
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:14,196
And you turned against them.

244
00:17:15,127 --> 00:17:18,119
Why did you turn against them
when you did?

245
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:32,204
I mean, why are you sitting there if you
don't intend to answer my questions?

246
00:17:32,287 --> 00:17:35,085
Because I was requested to
by General Hammond.

247
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:40,241
I see. And he didn't happen to mention
to you that part of the interview process

248
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:43,842
involved actually saying something?

249
00:17:44,367 --> 00:17:45,436
No.

250
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:50,398
OK. Um...

251
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:54,241
All right, let's try this.
Colonel Jack O'Neill.

252
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:58,362
You must have a tremendous
amount of respect for him.

253
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:01,598
Or maybe you don't. Let me rephrase.

254
00:18:01,687 --> 00:18:05,077
Colonel Jack O'Neill
is your immediate superior.

255
00:18:06,127 --> 00:18:09,722
OK, maybe not in terms of species, but...

256
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:12,526
- He's your commanding officer.
- Indeed.

257
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,167
Good! OK, good. Good.

258
00:18:15,247 --> 00:18:19,035
Terrific. Is there anything
you can tell us about him?

259
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:24,724
If you wish to learn of Colonel O'Neill,
you should interview Colonel O'Neill.

260
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:29,437
OK. Thanks. That's a good idea. Let me
ask you this... Where are you going?

261
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,085
How long?

262
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:42,683
- I don't know. Why? We just got here.
- An hour ago.

263
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:45,918
I need more time.
Look at this place, it's incredible.

264
00:18:46,687 --> 00:18:49,406
- You've seen one crumbled city...
- Sir.

265
00:18:49,487 --> 00:18:53,639
- This place was built by the Ancients.
- Are you sure?

266
00:18:53,727 --> 00:18:57,800
Yes. These markings,
and this stone architecture...

267
00:18:57,887 --> 00:19:00,242
Dr Jackson is gonna die
when he sees this.

268
00:19:00,327 --> 00:19:02,045
What, again?

269
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:03,924
Funny.

270
00:19:10,927 --> 00:19:12,485
Don't go far.

271
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,359
- It looks like an alien.
- Shut up.

272
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:23,804
- Remember that thing on P2X-787?
- Get lost.

273
00:19:23,887 --> 00:19:26,959
See, that thing was
easy on the eyes by comparison.

274
00:19:27,047 --> 00:19:29,038
Let me see.

275
00:19:31,327 --> 00:19:34,842
- That's pretty scary, Wells.
- It's my unborn son, sir.

276
00:19:34,927 --> 00:19:37,316
How can you tell?

277
00:19:38,207 --> 00:19:42,200
I don't know, Wells.
I wouldn't paint the room blue just yet.

278
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:45,317
Take cover!

279
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,203
Colonel, now!

280
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:25,078
Hold!

281
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:47,878
What the hell is it?

282
00:20:48,887 --> 00:20:52,243
Like the people who are now
serving here at the SGC,

283
00:20:52,327 --> 00:20:56,559
the youth of tomorrow will one day
have to defend the free spirit of mankind.

284
00:20:56,647 --> 00:21:02,677
And not just on our fair planet,
but out there. Through the Stargate.

285
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:05,361
In the vastness of the galaxy,

286
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:10,999
where untold evil with powers...
we've never seen before

287
00:21:11,087 --> 00:21:14,966
are still waiting... to prey upon us.

288
00:21:17,287 --> 00:21:18,879
OK. Cut.

289
00:21:21,687 --> 00:21:23,962
Senator. Great.

290
00:21:24,047 --> 00:21:28,245
Thank you so much for doing this.
It was really terrific.

291
00:21:28,327 --> 00:21:32,240
- These people deserve it.
- We're trying our best. Listen, Senator...

292
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:35,717
I hope you don't mind
me saying this, but...

293
00:21:36,847 --> 00:21:40,999
It sounded a bit like a speech.
I don't think you're gonna like the results.

294
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:46,525
What if we do it off-the-cuff and I throw
things at you and see how you respond?

295
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:48,438
No.

296
00:21:48,527 --> 00:21:50,165
- No?
- No.

297
00:21:50,807 --> 00:21:56,200
- If you want anything else from me...
- Yes, actually, Senator...

298
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:03,561
Colonel. As I'm sure you know,

299
00:22:03,647 --> 00:22:06,844
I'm to be part of the piece
these men are putting together

300
00:22:06,927 --> 00:22:11,398
to document the fine work
you're doing here at the SGC.

301
00:22:12,287 --> 00:22:16,121
- No, I didn't know that.
- Well, I'm...

302
00:22:16,207 --> 00:22:19,005
I'm sure there was a memo.

303
00:22:22,887 --> 00:22:26,323
Did you tell them about the time
you tried to shut this place?

304
00:22:26,407 --> 00:22:30,923
- Or the time you had Hammond by the...
- I suggest you watch what you say.

305
00:22:31,007 --> 00:22:35,319
- Slander is a serious offence.
- Yes. So I hear.

306
00:22:36,807 --> 00:22:41,039
I have always been
a strong supporter of this programme.

307
00:22:41,127 --> 00:22:43,925
I admit I was critical in the past,
but only because of

308
00:22:44,007 --> 00:22:48,797
the unrealized potential
I see this operation as having.

309
00:22:50,567 --> 00:22:53,206
How did your interview go, Colonel?

310
00:22:53,287 --> 00:22:55,437
It was short.

311
00:22:55,527 --> 00:22:57,518
Yet oh, so sweet.

312
00:22:58,047 --> 00:23:00,880
The president
wants you to play ball on this.

313
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:06,917
I hope you're not intending
to disappoint our Commander in Chief.

314
00:23:07,007 --> 00:23:12,877
I would think you would want to show
your appreciation for his backing.

315
00:23:12,967 --> 00:23:18,837
What are you doing here? Last time I
checked, you were trying to discredit him.

316
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:20,997
His term is up.

317
00:23:21,087 --> 00:23:26,445
My running mate and I are merely
pointing out to the American people

318
00:23:26,527 --> 00:23:29,883
certain areas that we think
we can do a better job in.

319
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:32,765
And when that time comes...

320
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:37,482
I know we can count
on your vote, Colonel.

321
00:23:37,567 --> 00:23:40,161
Yeah. That'll happen.

322
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:44,236
And I want you to know this.

323
00:23:44,327 --> 00:23:50,562
If elected, this programme
can count on our full support.

324
00:23:53,407 --> 00:23:55,875
- You want to get this?
- Sure.

325
00:23:59,047 --> 00:24:02,357
You smarmy,
self-righteous, opportunistic...

326
00:24:02,447 --> 00:24:04,563
Unscheduled offworld activation.

327
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:09,880
Colonel O'Neill to the control room.
Repeat, unscheduled offworld activation.

328
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:13,881
Duty calls.

329
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:17,960
- I was done.
- Colonel, what is this offworld activation?

330
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:21,164
- I won't know until I get there.
- Great. Where's there?

331
00:24:21,247 --> 00:24:23,841
There is here for you.

332
00:24:23,927 --> 00:24:26,282
Ongoing activity.

333
00:24:27,327 --> 00:24:30,478
Balinsky wants to stay, sir.

334
00:24:30,567 --> 00:24:33,206
You see anything else worth staying for?

335
00:24:33,287 --> 00:24:37,280
- Hard to say.
- We need to finish searching these ruins.

336
00:24:37,367 --> 00:24:41,360
- How long?
- A day or two, maybe more.

337
00:24:41,807 --> 00:24:44,844
Be nice to send up a UAV,
get an aerial overview.

338
00:24:44,927 --> 00:24:48,522
Permission to remain granted.
I'll send SG-3 as backup.

339
00:24:48,607 --> 00:24:52,202
- Any further threats, get out immediately.
- Understood, sir.

340
00:24:52,287 --> 00:24:57,236
In the meantime I can run some tests on
the device. See what it's been doing there.

341
00:24:57,327 --> 00:24:59,716
Send the device back,
report in on the hour.

342
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:02,844
Yes, sir. SG-13 out.

343
00:25:02,927 --> 00:25:04,724
Sir.

344
00:25:06,887 --> 00:25:10,596
- It's not that I don't appreciate...
- I knew they were headed your way.

345
00:25:10,687 --> 00:25:14,043
I thought you might be looking
for an excuse to get away.

346
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:20,475
I thought as much, sir. And I just wanted
to express my deep and unyielding...

347
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,876
...love for you, sir.

348
00:25:22,967 --> 00:25:26,960
General? If you have a moment,
Mr Bregman would like a word.

349
00:25:30,287 --> 00:25:34,883
"Exempt from clearance are all current
activities not reviewed by this office."

350
00:25:34,967 --> 00:25:37,322
That being the Pentagon.

351
00:25:37,407 --> 00:25:40,683
- Breathing is a current activity.
- My interpretation is:

352
00:25:40,767 --> 00:25:45,887
You are not authorized to know about
the most recent unscheduled activation.

353
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:49,039
General, I need a little leeway.

354
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:54,565
I said I was going to hold you to the letter
of these orders, Mr Bregman. Give it up.

355
00:26:00,087 --> 00:26:03,875
- You know, Colonel O'Neill...
- Is currently unavailable.

356
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:08,802
The president has given me his
full support. Why are you resisting?

357
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:11,606
I'm not resisting. I'm following orders.

358
00:26:11,687 --> 00:26:16,966
My opinion is that I don't think my people
need to be put under a microscope.

359
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:19,686
Cameras don't just record things.

360
00:26:19,767 --> 00:26:23,282
They change what they record
simply by being there.

361
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:26,962
The work these people do
is hard enough without them feeling

362
00:26:27,047 --> 00:26:30,835
that every breath they take
is being preserved for judgment.

363
00:26:30,927 --> 00:26:33,202
- Maybe it should be.
- Excuse me?

364
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,642
I said maybe it should be.

365
00:26:35,727 --> 00:26:40,198
The Pentagon has allowed journalists
to be embedded with the forces before.

366
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:45,042
Under fire, under pressure. So that
what's seen and what's heard is the truth.

367
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:48,802
- I think we're through.
- I don't. I don't disagree...

368
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:51,401
Excuse me.

369
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:07,321
- You ever seen anything like this?
- I have not.

370
00:27:07,407 --> 00:27:12,686
Definitely a remote probe of some kind.
The capacity of the memory is immense.

371
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:17,079
But so far, all I've found
are detailed images of the ruins.

372
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:21,319
You know, it makes sense. We use
a MALP, why wouldn't the Goa'uld?

373
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:27,676
The Goa'uld are scavengers. It is quite
possible they got the idea from us.

374
00:27:27,767 --> 00:27:31,123
So, you do your interview
with the documentary crew yet?

375
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:32,435
Indeed.

376
00:27:32,527 --> 00:27:35,485
I can't wait to hear
what everyone else said.

377
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:38,127
I did not say much.

378
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:42,644
Really? That is surprising.
It's usually so hard to shut you up.

379
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,438
I found the entire experience unpleasant.

380
00:27:47,527 --> 00:27:52,203
- They want to talk to me again.
- Did your interview not go well either?

381
00:27:52,287 --> 00:27:56,917
I thought it was fine,
but apparently I looked nervous.

382
00:28:04,047 --> 00:28:08,325
What is the meaning of
"offworld activation"? What is that about?

383
00:28:08,407 --> 00:28:11,399
- I'm not...
- You wouldn't tell me even if you knew.

384
00:28:11,487 --> 00:28:15,526
You remind me of the minders in the Gulf
that used to censor our reports.

385
00:28:15,607 --> 00:28:18,724
It's not as if we're conspiring
to cover up the truth.

386
00:28:18,807 --> 00:28:21,116
Censoring reports in combat
makes sense.

387
00:28:21,207 --> 00:28:25,439
You should not jeopardise troops
involved in ongoing missions.

388
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:31,045
This isn't the news. Are you broadcasting
this to the enemy on some other planet?

389
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:34,802
Look, I have been denied access
to several prior mission files

390
00:28:34,887 --> 00:28:38,118
cos no one wants me to know
how close we've come to...

391
00:28:38,207 --> 00:28:40,926
You're not conspiring.
Why don't you tell me?

392
00:28:41,007 --> 00:28:44,079
- We've come close to what?
- Being compromised.

393
00:28:44,167 --> 00:28:46,635
Being compromised.
There's a euphemism.

394
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:50,515
Close to the brink of
planetary annihilation is more accurate.

395
00:28:50,607 --> 00:28:52,916
That's why we're not allowed to film.

396
00:28:53,007 --> 00:28:56,522
Every time they open that gate,
something could go wrong.

397
00:28:56,607 --> 00:29:02,239
In which case, it wouldn't really matter
what we had on tape, would it?

398
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:04,795
What did you say?

399
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:07,923
What did you say? "It doesn't matter"?

400
00:29:08,007 --> 00:29:12,876
If you had any integrity at all, you would
resign before I had to replace you.

401
00:29:12,967 --> 00:29:16,642
I'd rather be replaced
than court-martialled.

402
00:29:16,727 --> 00:29:22,006
The bottom line is, the SGC is not gonna
let any of this out until it's declassified.

403
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:24,885
- Why not shoot it and decide later?
- It's not up to me.

404
00:29:24,967 --> 00:29:27,686
"Not up to me." "Not up to me."

405
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:31,077
Colonel. Colonel.
We're all set up for you right here.

406
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,476
- Briefing.
- Colonel. Colonel.

407
00:29:33,567 --> 00:29:36,923
Colonel! You know, I'm gonna get you
on camera sooner or later.

408
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:41,080
Even if all I get is a series of shots
of you avoiding being got.

409
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:45,365
Fire away.
I hope shots of my ass serve you well.

410
00:29:50,327 --> 00:29:53,717
All right, pack up.
What are we doing here?

411
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:58,437
How do you feel about Colonel O'Neill?

412
00:29:59,527 --> 00:30:01,722
He's an amazing man.

413
00:30:01,807 --> 00:30:06,881
After everything he's done, he's still
modest. Quite self-effacing, actually.

414
00:30:06,967 --> 00:30:10,960
He even likes people to think
he's not as smart as he really is.

415
00:30:11,047 --> 00:30:13,515
Bottom line:
He's an incredibly strong leader

416
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:18,476
who's given more of himself for this
programme than any man has given for...

417
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:21,525
well, anything I can imagine.

418
00:30:22,327 --> 00:30:25,922
Do you spend a lot of time
together outside of work?

419
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:28,123
We don't get much time outside of work.

420
00:30:28,207 --> 00:30:32,200
And when we do,
our personal interests are a little different.

421
00:30:32,287 --> 00:30:36,519
Did you ever hear the expression
"opposites attract"?

422
00:30:36,607 --> 00:30:39,201
We have a very professional relationship.

423
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:43,121
Really? Professional?
After everything you've been through?

424
00:30:43,207 --> 00:30:47,758
You must have, maybe it's not
too much to say, faced death together?

425
00:30:47,847 --> 00:30:54,082
Yeah. Not unlike countless military
personnel throughout the years.

426
00:30:54,167 --> 00:30:59,719
I won't deny there's a bond between us.
Daniel and Teal'c are also like family.

427
00:30:59,807 --> 00:31:03,880
Colonel O'Neill is first and foremost
my superior officer.

428
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:08,961
Even if there was potential for something
more, and I'm not saying that there is,

429
00:31:09,047 --> 00:31:14,997
our military positions and the very
nature of our job wouldn't allow for it.

430
00:31:16,287 --> 00:31:20,724
Well, basically,
when the gate is dialing, I say:

431
00:31:20,807 --> 00:31:24,117
"Chevron one encoded,
chevron two encoded"

432
00:31:24,207 --> 00:31:28,166
and so on incrementally,
up to the seventh chevron,

433
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:34,277
which is a little different because
that's when the wormhole connects.

434
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:38,963
When that happens, I like to
change things up a bit and just say:

435
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:41,720
"Chevron seven locked."

436
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:44,756
Locked. That's great.

437
00:31:44,847 --> 00:31:48,203
That's good. Anything else?

438
00:31:48,287 --> 00:31:51,518
Oh, yeah. I'm responsible for this.

439
00:31:53,007 --> 00:31:54,884
Close the iris.

440
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,637
Open the iris.

441
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:07,647
That's pretty much my job, right there.

442
00:32:08,607 --> 00:32:10,882
- That's it?
- Pretty much.

443
00:32:11,327 --> 00:32:14,683
- I think you're being a little modest.
- Oh, I mean...

444
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:16,917
Don't get me wrong.

445
00:32:17,007 --> 00:32:19,885
It's really rewarding. It really is.

446
00:32:19,967 --> 00:32:23,437
And we have tried
various automated scenarios,

447
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:30,080
but the SG teams agree that when they
send the iris code through the wormhole,

448
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:34,797
they like to know that
there's a real person on the other end.

449
00:32:34,887 --> 00:32:37,959
Someone that they can trust to get it right.

450
00:32:40,007 --> 00:32:44,523
That gives me
and the other gate technicians

451
00:32:44,607 --> 00:32:47,679
a great sense of pride.

452
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:50,565
Sure. That's good.

453
00:33:01,807 --> 00:33:04,844
- Dr Jackson. Hi.
- Hey, how's it going?

454
00:33:04,927 --> 00:33:08,397
You're packing. Going off...
Sorry, I forgot the expression.

455
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,524
- Offworld.
- Offworld. Is that it? So, you're going?

456
00:33:11,607 --> 00:33:14,121
No, no. Just going through my pack.

457
00:33:14,207 --> 00:33:19,725
That's the camera you use, though, right?
I've seen hours and hours of your footage.

458
00:33:19,807 --> 00:33:23,880
- Inscriptions and ruins and artefacts.
- Cool, huh?

459
00:33:24,927 --> 00:33:26,440
I wonder...

460
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:31,237
If you get the opportunity, maybe you
could point your camera at some action?

461
00:33:31,327 --> 00:33:33,079
Just for a change?

462
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:36,523
See, when there is action,
I'm too busy to be pointing a camera.

463
00:33:36,607 --> 00:33:39,917
I'm running, shooting,
translating what the bad guys are saying.

464
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:45,843
It's just that I've heard a lot about these
amazing events. But my medium is visual.

465
00:33:45,927 --> 00:33:48,600
I can't tell the story unless I have pictures.

466
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:52,316
I'm not suggesting you put
anybody in danger, not yourself,

467
00:33:52,407 --> 00:33:55,080
but if the opportunity arises,

468
00:33:55,167 --> 00:33:59,160
take a second and just
point your lens at something that moves.

469
00:33:59,247 --> 00:34:04,002
All right. Well, I'm not scheduled to go on
a mission offworld for a couple of days.

470
00:34:04,087 --> 00:34:06,078
- If it's there, shoot it.
- Right.

471
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:10,877
Just not the inscriptions all the time.
Some action would be good.

472
00:34:16,407 --> 00:34:18,762
- Hey.
- Hey. One second.

473
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:23,837
You want me to translate something?

474
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:29,559
I'm trying to get the interface connection
stable. SG-13 kicked the crap out of it.

475
00:34:29,647 --> 00:34:33,037
Its system log seems to be isolated
on a separate crystal.

476
00:34:33,127 --> 00:34:39,123
Bregman had the nerve to suggest that
all that archive video footage was boring.

477
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:45,637
OK. Here's what really bugs me. He's only
here cos this president is on his way out.

478
00:34:45,727 --> 00:34:49,037
He doesn't want to look bad
if and when the programme goes public.

479
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:51,482
This is all about political posturing.

480
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:54,035
Man, he really grilled me on that.

481
00:34:54,127 --> 00:34:57,119
About the programme going public?
What did you say?

482
00:34:57,207 --> 00:35:00,358
- Babbled incoherently.
- Could you imagine if it did?

483
00:35:00,447 --> 00:35:03,041
I try not to think about it.

484
00:35:09,327 --> 00:35:10,919
There.

485
00:35:11,927 --> 00:35:16,717
- It's mostly just technical stuff.
- Anything jump out at you?

486
00:35:16,807 --> 00:35:20,356
Well, here's where it encountered SG-13.

487
00:35:21,367 --> 00:35:23,961
- Uh-oh.
- What are "Uh-oh"?

488
00:35:24,047 --> 00:35:30,202
After it engaged shields and weapons
it activated a long-range communicator.

489
00:35:30,287 --> 00:35:31,766
Colonel Dixon.

490
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:36,557
We believe the Goa'uld probe sent out
a transmission prior to your disabling it.

491
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:39,605
I'm ordering you to return immediately.

492
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:44,920
Roger that, sir. Estimated arrival time
15 minutes. Dixon out.

493
00:35:45,927 --> 00:35:48,999
Pack it up, Doctor. We're going home.

494
00:35:52,087 --> 00:35:54,840
- Wells, Bosworth.
- Wells here.

495
00:35:54,927 --> 00:35:56,997
Bring it home. We're booking out.

496
00:35:57,087 --> 00:36:00,557
- Roger that. Wells out.
- It's about time.

497
00:36:04,447 --> 00:36:07,120
Taking fire! Wells has been hit.

498
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:12,405
Get to the gate.
SG niner, requesting assistance.

499
00:36:13,967 --> 00:36:21,123
OK. Three gunshot wounds, four
staff-weapon burns, severe hypothermia.

500
00:36:21,207 --> 00:36:27,123
I'm quite surprised he's actually
authorized me to discuss all this.

501
00:36:27,207 --> 00:36:30,085
Nanite technology artificially aged him.

502
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:33,955
He had his shoulder punctured
by an alien time capsule device.

503
00:36:34,047 --> 00:36:36,515
Three knee operations.

504
00:36:38,607 --> 00:36:43,044
That's the whole Hathor incident
which he's asked me never to discuss.

505
00:36:43,127 --> 00:36:48,599
Oh, this was a good one. Last year he was
exposed to an ancient incurable disease.

506
00:36:48,687 --> 00:36:51,485
Obviously not incurable, right? Or...

507
00:36:51,567 --> 00:36:56,641
Well, there was a Tok'ra symbiote in need
of a temporary host. That did the trick.

508
00:36:56,727 --> 00:37:02,120
I don't understand what you just said, but
it's amazing that Colonel O'Neill is alive.

509
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:07,076
Yeah, I never know what's next. You just
try and keep your head on straight.

510
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:11,001
We also set a lot of broken bones
and prescribe a ton of antibiotics.

511
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:13,920
Well, still, it sometimes
must be overwhelming.

512
00:37:14,007 --> 00:37:18,239
Yeah. It's funny. All the training,
everything we know about medicine...

513
00:37:18,327 --> 00:37:23,720
It amounts to very little. Often I face
situations where there's nothing I can do.

514
00:37:23,807 --> 00:37:27,277
- Is there an upside?
- Are you kidding me?

515
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:32,316
We all persevere because we feel we're on
the brink of understanding so much more.

516
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:35,205
And not just about medicine,
but about who we are.

517
00:37:35,287 --> 00:37:38,279
Where we came from,
what the future has in store,

518
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:41,086
how we fit into
the grand scheme of things.

519
00:37:41,167 --> 00:37:46,480
Unscheduled offworld activation.
Repeat, unscheduled offworld activation.

520
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:51,038
- We've heard that before. Is that unusual?
- No, it happens from time to time.

521
00:37:51,127 --> 00:37:55,086
- What does it mean?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

522
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:57,681
- You got that announcement?
- Yeah, we're good.

523
00:37:57,767 --> 00:38:00,361
OK, good. Well, thank you, Dr Fraiser.

524
00:38:00,447 --> 00:38:05,805
Guys, why don't you go roll some
cutaways and get some sound bites.

525
00:38:05,887 --> 00:38:09,766
- So this...
- Yeah, we're good. Thank you.

526
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:12,077
Uh, anything you can. OK?

527
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,158
- Sorry.
- Ow. Ow.

528
00:38:17,287 --> 00:38:20,006
I'm glad the Pentagon sent you. Just...

529
00:38:20,087 --> 00:38:21,964
Go away.

530
00:38:22,887 --> 00:38:28,917
Listen, I was just wondering. It seems
like the unpredictable happens here a lot.

531
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,396
- Yes. Pretty much.
- Yeah.

532
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:36,286
- You're not needed for this thing?
- If I am, they know where to find me.

533
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:40,485
I was thinking of getting something
to eat in the café. I'm not sure where...

534
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:42,398
- That way.
- I was wondering...

535
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:45,797
If I'd like to join you. OK, yeah.

536
00:38:45,887 --> 00:38:48,606
- What are you doing?
- I'm just white balancing.

537
00:38:48,687 --> 00:38:52,282
Well, go balance the white
somewhere else, OK?

538
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:56,883
- Somewhere else.
- I'm gonna dump these first.

539
00:38:57,967 --> 00:39:02,563
- Wells is alive, but he's hurt badly.
- How many Jaffa? Five? Ten? A hundred?

540
00:39:02,647 --> 00:39:06,196
Colonel Dixon counted six.
They were able to fend them off.

541
00:39:06,287 --> 00:39:09,836
- Did the Jaffa come through the gate?
- No, SG-3 was covering it.

542
00:39:09,927 --> 00:39:12,521
- The gate's clear?
- SG-3 was there when I left.

543
00:39:12,607 --> 00:39:15,201
- Take SG-5 and 7 and Dr Fraiser.
- Thank you.

544
00:39:15,287 --> 00:39:16,766
- Colonel.
- Yes, sir.

545
00:39:16,847 --> 00:39:19,884
It sounds like an ambush.
But there's nothing else we can do.

546
00:39:19,967 --> 00:39:21,844
Right. Go.

547
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:32,766
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

548
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:39,685
I was just thinking that you have
a very natural quality. I mean, on camera.

549
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:41,917
You let me film...

550
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:47,684
You allow people to see
grace under pressure.

551
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,959
Are you flirting with me?

552
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:59,043
Ah, well... See, I, on the other hand,
am very clumsy under pressure.

553
00:40:00,087 --> 00:40:01,759
I've seen worse.

554
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:04,761
So, um... What's with the ring?

555
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:07,366
Oh, just...

556
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:11,201
It's sentimental.
My wife died a few years ago.

557
00:40:11,287 --> 00:40:14,199
So how do any of you
have a personal life?

558
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:17,962
We don't. I spend most of my time
outside work with my daughter.

559
00:40:18,047 --> 00:40:20,117
- Oh. So you're married.
- No.

560
00:40:20,207 --> 00:40:23,085
- No, she's adopted.
- Oh.

561
00:40:23,567 --> 00:40:26,445
She's from another planet.

562
00:40:28,807 --> 00:40:30,206
OK.

563
00:40:30,287 --> 00:40:33,996
Um... would you be willing
to talk about that on camera?

564
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:36,442
- I'd rather...
- Excuse me, ma'am.

565
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:39,724
- You're required in the ready room.
- Thank you.

566
00:40:40,167 --> 00:40:42,283
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

567
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:51,398
Let's go, gentlemen.

568
00:40:53,607 --> 00:40:55,643
All because I wanted an aerial survey.

569
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:58,764
Took me too long to figure out
it sent a transmission.

570
00:40:58,847 --> 00:41:01,566
None of that matters now.

571
