1
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:15,476
The Nikkei dropped 8%.
The yen continued its free fall.

2
00:00:15,567 --> 00:00:18,764
Also, the president of Togo
was deposed six hours ago.

3
00:00:18,847 --> 00:00:25,958
He got a plane to Nigeria. Now he's calling
for American troops to help restore order.

4
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:28,880
- This is my first day.
- Yes, Mr President.

5
00:00:28,967 --> 00:00:32,846
The New York Times is launching
an investigation into voting irregularities

6
00:00:32,927 --> 00:00:36,203
in six southern states.
I've got Teddy on it.

7
00:00:36,287 --> 00:00:39,882
- Who are these people following me?
- They work for you, Mr President.

8
00:00:39,967 --> 00:00:42,959
Also, there's a storm in the Atlantic
about to hit Maine.

9
00:00:43,047 --> 00:00:47,837
They're expecting gale-force winds
and 20 inches of snow.

10
00:00:50,647 --> 00:00:53,639
- Shouldn't I know who they are?
- Yes, Mr President.

11
00:00:53,727 --> 00:00:57,720
Emergency management teams are
standing by, but we've scheduled a call

12
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,038
so you can pledge your support.

13
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:05,166
- They won't follow me all the time?
- No, Mr President.

14
00:01:05,247 --> 00:01:07,158
Good.

15
00:01:07,247 --> 00:01:10,000
Hello. Holly.

16
00:01:10,087 --> 00:01:15,559
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs
is waiting for you in your office.

17
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,525
- He knows it's my first day, right?
- Yes, Mr President.

18
00:01:25,607 --> 00:01:27,643
Good.

19
00:01:29,207 --> 00:01:31,801
- Francis.
- Mr President.

20
00:01:34,487 --> 00:01:37,638
We need to talk, sir. It's important.

21
00:01:37,727 --> 00:01:40,366
Guys.

22
00:01:40,447 --> 00:01:42,597
Let me enjoy the moment.

23
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:53,323
Moment's over, sir.

24
00:01:55,207 --> 00:01:57,846
Right.

25
00:01:57,927 --> 00:02:00,760
Stan, thank you. Thank you.

26
00:02:08,927 --> 00:02:12,715
Mr President, I'm here to bring you
up to speed on a programme

27
00:02:12,807 --> 00:02:16,561
we've been running out of Cheyenne
Mountain for the past seven years.

28
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:19,207
I've already had my top-secret briefing.

29
00:02:19,287 --> 00:02:21,562
Yes, Mr President, but not this.

30
00:02:24,047 --> 00:02:29,280
For the past seven years, the Air Force
has been sending teams to other planets

31
00:02:29,367 --> 00:02:32,996
by means of an alien device
known as the Stargate.

32
00:02:34,047 --> 00:02:38,837
That's funny. That's very funny.
My first day.

33
00:02:38,927 --> 00:02:41,885
This is a joke, right?
I have a great sense of humour.

34
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:46,961
I didn't know that you had one, but good,
we're finding out about each other.

35
00:02:47,047 --> 00:02:50,835
Now I have to call
the ex-president of Togo,

36
00:02:50,927 --> 00:02:56,001
and when I'm done, apparently,
the rest of the world is coming to an end.

37
00:02:56,087 --> 00:03:00,285
The ex-president of Togo
will have to wait, sir. This is not a joke.

38
00:03:05,447 --> 00:03:10,123
The United States Air Force has been
sending people to other planets?

39
00:03:10,207 --> 00:03:12,084
- Yes, sir.
- For seven years?

40
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:15,557
- That's correct.
- By means of an alien device?

41
00:03:15,647 --> 00:03:17,478
Known as the Stargate.

42
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:28,318
Senator McKnight is requesting
we move your meeting.

43
00:04:28,407 --> 00:04:31,638
Trying to duck me. He doesn't
want to commit on the crime bill.

44
00:04:31,727 --> 00:04:33,638
- What should I tell them?
- Forget it.

45
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:39,643
The son of a bitch came in on our
coattails. Now it's time to pay the piper.

46
00:04:40,927 --> 00:04:43,600
- What the hell were you thinking?
- Mr President.

47
00:04:43,687 --> 00:04:47,566
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Sara.

48
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:50,559
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

49
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:58,163
You've just been briefed by the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs on our new reality.

50
00:04:58,247 --> 00:05:03,162
Not only do I find out that the Air Force
is engaged in interstellar travel,

51
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:06,762
but I also find out
that my running mate knows all about it.

52
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:09,964
- I was under a special gag order.
- Since when?

53
00:05:10,047 --> 00:05:12,402
- Six years now.
- That's unbelievable.

54
00:05:12,487 --> 00:05:15,160
Mr President,
I realize this is overwhelming,

55
00:05:15,247 --> 00:05:20,162
but what you need to know is that the
Stargate is being seriously mismanaged.

56
00:05:20,247 --> 00:05:24,684
- It's urgent that we act now.
- What are you talking about?

57
00:05:24,767 --> 00:05:29,682
I have desperately tried to maintain
some proper control and accountability,

58
00:05:29,767 --> 00:05:32,725
but the oversight in place
is completely inadequate.

59
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:35,446
The military specifically.

60
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:40,396
The personnel directly involved in the
SGC need to be replaced immediately.

61
00:05:40,487 --> 00:05:44,480
Now, I have several recommendations
regarding...

62
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:47,240
Whoa, Bob, hold on here.

63
00:05:47,327 --> 00:05:52,685
Mr President, why do you think
I was ordered to keep quiet?

64
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:57,680
This was an attempt by the military
and the previous administration

65
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:03,399
to drive a wedge between us, because
they knew I was going to come after them.

66
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:06,081
We need to stick together on this.

67
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:10,206
For God's sakes, Bob,
think of the magnitude of this!

68
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,721
"For God's sake" is right.

69
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:17,085
Oh, come on, Bob. If you want me to buy
into your holier-than-thou position,

70
00:06:17,167 --> 00:06:20,443
you've got to convince me you're right.

71
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:29,718
Hosted alien dignitaries.

72
00:06:29,807 --> 00:06:33,402
Acquired alien technology.

73
00:06:33,487 --> 00:06:36,445
Traveled back in time?

74
00:06:37,247 --> 00:06:39,283
Did they really blow up a sun?

75
00:06:39,927 --> 00:06:42,646
As I understand it, sir, yes, they did.

76
00:06:43,287 --> 00:06:46,438
It's gotta look awfully good
on the old resumé, hey?

77
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:51,885
- They've done pretty amazing things.
- You sound like a fan, Francis.

78
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:56,836
Well, I can't help but appreciate the
number of times they've saved this world.

79
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:59,680
Some people think
it wouldn't have needed saving

80
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:02,600
had we left well enough alone.

81
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:05,599
Well, you can't deny what's out there, sir.

82
00:07:05,687 --> 00:07:08,076
The enemy
would have come for us anyway.

83
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,123
We need to be prepared.

84
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:13,358
And no matter what anyone says,
the people at the SGC

85
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:17,804
have done the best job anyone could
under the circumstances.

86
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:23,598
- You don't trust the vice president?
- He obviously has his own agenda.

87
00:07:25,047 --> 00:07:28,562
I know he tried to shut them down
when he was at Appropriations.

88
00:07:28,647 --> 00:07:33,004
Frankly, the vice president knows
as well as anyone else it's too late for that.

89
00:07:33,087 --> 00:07:36,318
- If he didn't six years ago, he does now.
- What does that mean?

90
00:07:36,407 --> 00:07:41,003
He clearly doesn't want to shut the gate
down any more. He wants to control it.

91
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,601
We have a civilian agency
known as the NID.

92
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,918
Now, its mandate has been to keep an eye

93
00:07:50,007 --> 00:07:53,044
on top-secret projects
like the Stargate programme

94
00:07:53,127 --> 00:07:55,880
and has done so from the beginning.

95
00:07:55,967 --> 00:08:02,440
I propose that we give this organisation
direct control of the gate,

96
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:04,995
effective immediately.

97
00:08:06,767 --> 00:08:11,443
There's only one reason he
wanted them to give control to the NID.

98
00:08:11,527 --> 00:08:15,361
He was about to become chairman
of the Intelligence Oversight Committee.

99
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:18,883
Which would have put the NID
and the Stargate in his back pocket.

100
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,117
He had the ambassadors in his hand.

101
00:08:21,207 --> 00:08:24,597
It was only because of extraordinary
intervention that it didn't work.

102
00:08:34,607 --> 00:08:37,121
- Hello?
- Hello.

103
00:08:37,207 --> 00:08:41,678
I am Thor,
Supreme Commander of the Asgard fleet.

104
00:08:41,767 --> 00:08:46,716
- Commander Thor, my name is...
- Senator Kinsey.

105
00:08:46,807 --> 00:08:51,483
O'Neill suggested I send you
to a distant planet for your actions here,

106
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:54,718
but I am reasonably certain
his statement was in jest.

107
00:08:54,807 --> 00:08:59,517
- I'm sure it was, Commander.
- Supreme Commander.

108
00:08:59,607 --> 00:09:02,724
It is the opinion
of the Asgard High Council

109
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:05,605
that Stargate Command
should be left in the hands

110
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:09,043
of General Hammond and his team.

111
00:09:09,127 --> 00:09:13,120
And while our continued friendship
with Earth is not contingent on that,

112
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:15,118
it is preferred.

113
00:09:19,527 --> 00:09:22,041
I wonder why he wants it so badly.

114
00:09:22,127 --> 00:09:26,598
I mean,
besides his belief in his divine right.

115
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:28,325
I don't know, sir.

116
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:35,358
Not that that's not enough, but I get this
feeling that there's something more to it.

117
00:09:35,447 --> 00:09:37,438
Yes, sir.

118
00:09:39,127 --> 00:09:43,678
That rogue element at NID that he took
credit for taking down last year...

119
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:48,477
We've never had any proof connecting
Senator Kinsey to anything nefarious.

120
00:09:48,567 --> 00:09:54,199
I've got a bad feeling about where some
of that campaign financing came from.

121
00:09:54,287 --> 00:09:57,996
- Mr President.
- Did I say that out loud?

122
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:17,080
Ah! Mr Woolsey.

123
00:10:18,327 --> 00:10:21,524
I hope my confidence in you
has not been misplaced.

124
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:23,757
You have my word, sir.

125
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:26,645
Once I finish,
the president will have no choice

126
00:10:26,727 --> 00:10:31,243
but to follow your recommendation
and clean house at Stargate Command.

127
00:10:40,087 --> 00:10:42,078
I'm sorry to keep you waiting,

128
00:10:42,167 --> 00:10:45,637
but I was just wrapping up
a meeting with the Joint Chiefs.

129
00:10:45,727 --> 00:10:49,481
Francis,
I thought you'd want to sit in on this one.

130
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,558
Thank you, sir.

131
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,120
General, I don't believe
you know Richard Woolsey.

132
00:10:57,207 --> 00:10:59,721
For months,
he has been working with the NID

133
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:04,119
conducting a thorough investigation
of all Stargate personnel.

134
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:07,438
I've asked him here
to kindly present us with his findings.

135
00:11:07,527 --> 00:11:11,406
If this is a discussion of the competence
of those running the SGC,

136
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:13,318
shouldn't Hammond be included?

137
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:17,002
Unfortunately, sir,
General Hammond is part of the problem.

138
00:11:17,087 --> 00:11:20,397
George Hammond
is a highly decorated officer,

139
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:22,603
a 30-year veteran with the Air Force,

140
00:11:22,687 --> 00:11:25,565
and while that may not carry
weight over at the NID,

141
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,081
it still means something to certain people.

142
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:32,638
This isn't a trial. Although it certainly
wouldn't surprise me if it came to that.

143
00:11:32,727 --> 00:11:35,639
Let's stick to specifics here.

144
00:11:35,727 --> 00:11:39,322
If these people need to be replaced,
I want to see evidence.

145
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,318
Thank you, Mr President.

146
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:44,717
The most recent incident
was less than a month ago.

147
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:47,526
General Hammond
ordered an offworld rescue

148
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:52,237
despite ample indication that he was
sending his people into an ambush.

149
00:11:52,327 --> 00:11:56,320
As a result, a very valuable member
of Stargate Command was killed.

150
00:11:56,407 --> 00:11:58,204
Dr Janet Fraiser.

151
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:01,165
Sending people
into potentially dangerous situations

152
00:12:01,247 --> 00:12:03,920
is a natural consequence
of military command.

153
00:12:04,007 --> 00:12:06,805
Maybe so, but ignoring evidence
of an enemy trap

154
00:12:06,887 --> 00:12:10,038
is at best foolish
and at worst criminally negligent.

155
00:12:10,127 --> 00:12:12,357
General Hammond admits responsibility.

156
00:12:12,447 --> 00:12:15,245
His own report is essentially a confession.

157
00:12:15,327 --> 00:12:18,558
All that proves is the man
had the guts to own up to his mistakes.

158
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:23,641
Unfortunately, in this case, mistakes can
lead to compromising the entire planet.

159
00:12:23,727 --> 00:12:28,755
I have a mountain of evidence implicating
not only Hammond but his first-line team.

160
00:12:28,847 --> 00:12:30,360
They are heroes.

161
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:35,521
We have no intention of minimising the
accomplishments of the General or SG-1.

162
00:12:35,607 --> 00:12:38,599
Their respective achievements
speak for themselves,

163
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:45,365
but intermittent successes
cannot excuse ongoing misconduct.

164
00:12:45,447 --> 00:12:50,396
Over the past seven years, SG-1 has
shown a disregard for military authority.

165
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:55,686
They have compromised national security
and exercised extremely poor judgement.

166
00:12:55,767 --> 00:12:59,919
You should be on my speechwriting team.

167
00:13:00,007 --> 00:13:03,044
Come on, cut the crap, will you?

168
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:10,920
As crazy as it sounds, we're talking about
people who are fighting aliens. Right?

169
00:13:11,007 --> 00:13:15,205
- Could we please be specific?
- Yes, sir.

170
00:13:16,487 --> 00:13:21,959
Let's start with insubordination. Five and
a half years ago, the gate was shut down.

171
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:27,280
The SGC was under orders to suspend
all offworld travel, pending a full review.

172
00:13:27,367 --> 00:13:32,600
- SG-1 chose to ignore those orders.
- And managed to head off an invasion.

173
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:38,398
Nonetheless, they were guilty. And it was
by no means an isolated incident.

174
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:02,118
Let's go.

175
00:14:10,247 --> 00:14:12,238
O'Neill.

176
00:14:14,247 --> 00:14:16,238
Not this time, Teal'c.

177
00:14:29,647 --> 00:14:33,606
They sabotaged a mothership the Goa'uld
would have used to attack Earth.

178
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:37,600
They used the Stargate
against a direct order of a superior officer.

179
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:41,521
You can't hold them accountable for that.
Read the damn mission report.

180
00:14:41,607 --> 00:14:44,326
They were under the influence
of an alien device.

181
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:47,444
Yes, of course. Which brings us
to the alarming frequency

182
00:14:47,527 --> 00:14:52,396
with which members
of SG-1 have fallen under alien influence.

183
00:14:52,487 --> 00:14:58,801
Major Samantha Carter.
Implanted with a Goa'uld symbiote.

184
00:14:58,887 --> 00:15:03,756
Then, two years ago,
her body became host to an alien virus.

185
00:15:13,927 --> 00:15:15,679
Daniel Jackson.

186
00:15:15,767 --> 00:15:20,158
Fell under the influence of alien
technology on numerous occasions,

187
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:26,356
had his body play host to not one
but 12 alien psyches simultaneously.

188
00:15:26,447 --> 00:15:30,122
Most interestingly, apparently died,

189
00:15:30,207 --> 00:15:34,325
and, according to the report,
"evolved into a higher being."

190
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:56,045
Teal'c, an alien,
former soldier of the Goa'uld,

191
00:15:56,127 --> 00:16:01,485
now possesses full security clearance
at our most secret facility.

192
00:16:01,567 --> 00:16:03,876
- He earned that trust.
- Yes.

193
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:10,486
That trust almost cost SG-1 dearly
when he rejoined the ranks of Apophis.

194
00:16:11,927 --> 00:16:13,280
Buddy.

195
00:16:18,327 --> 00:16:21,000
What you got going here, Teal'c?

196
00:16:22,407 --> 00:16:27,959
Well done, Teal'c. Finally, you've resumed
your rightful position as my first prime.

197
00:16:28,047 --> 00:16:30,800
He'd been brainwashed by the enemy.

198
00:16:30,887 --> 00:16:36,280
Yes - like his fellow team members, he's
shown a vulnerability to alien influence.

199
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:40,963
Which finally brings us
to the team leader, Jack O'Neill.

200
00:16:43,207 --> 00:16:46,836
Infected by alien contagions
a half-dozen times,

201
00:16:46,927 --> 00:16:51,523
experimented upon by
extraterrestrials another half-dozen times,

202
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:56,237
had his memories manipulated
on numerous occasions.

203
00:16:56,327 --> 00:16:59,558
Had the entire repository
of an ancient alien database

204
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,002
effectively downloaded into his head.

205
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:03,918
Whoa!

206
00:17:14,687 --> 00:17:16,359
Colonel.

207
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:20,326
Not long after this, the Colonel
began exhibiting strange behaviour,

208
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:24,685
speaking an alien language,
demonstrating superhuman intellect.

209
00:17:24,767 --> 00:17:27,235
He was undergoing
some sort of transformation,

210
00:17:27,327 --> 00:17:29,636
as a result of the knowledge
he had absorbed.

211
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:33,037
Were it not for the timely intervention
of another alien race,

212
00:17:33,127 --> 00:17:35,083
he would have been lost to us.

213
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:38,125
How these people maintain
their sanity is beyond me.

214
00:17:38,207 --> 00:17:43,042
- I'm having trouble just listening to it.
- That, Mr President, is exactly my point.

215
00:17:43,127 --> 00:17:47,439
How can we trust these individuals
after everything they've been through?

216
00:17:47,527 --> 00:17:50,883
Well, they seem to be
handling it very well.

217
00:17:50,967 --> 00:17:54,880
But who's to say they are
completely free of these influences?

218
00:17:54,967 --> 00:17:58,118
They're routinely cleared
by medical professionals.

219
00:17:58,207 --> 00:18:01,961
We can no longer allow the Pentagon
to look the other way.

220
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:06,484
The number of times the members
of SG-1 have been compromised

221
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:10,640
should have warranted at least
a reconsideration of their offworld status,

222
00:18:10,727 --> 00:18:15,926
transfers to less decisive positions,
a couple of sick days, for God's sake.

223
00:18:16,007 --> 00:18:20,046
The first time I heard about this,
I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

224
00:18:20,127 --> 00:18:24,723
I tried to imagine myself doing what these
people have been doing for seven years,

225
00:18:24,807 --> 00:18:30,086
and quite frankly, I don't think
any of us can really understand

226
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:34,445
what they've been going through,
no matter how many files we read.

227
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:37,519
All the more reason for intensive scrutiny.

228
00:18:37,607 --> 00:18:42,806
If new protocols and standards of conduct
need to be established,

229
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:44,957
this is where it has to start.

230
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:56,084
- What do you say we take a break?
- Yes, sir.

231
00:19:09,447 --> 00:19:12,837
You can't possibly be taking their side.

232
00:19:13,767 --> 00:19:17,043
- I need time to absorb this, Bob.
- We may not have much time.

233
00:19:17,127 --> 00:19:19,721
- The longer those people...
- Relax.

234
00:19:19,807 --> 00:19:25,404
All I'm saying is, at the moment, I'm going
to give them the benefit of the doubt.

235
00:19:25,487 --> 00:19:28,604
- I need to know more.
- I think you know all you need to know.

236
00:19:28,687 --> 00:19:30,723
That includes why you're here.

237
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:34,918
I'm here, Bob,
because the people of this nation

238
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,475
elected me to run their country.

239
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,637
Not the whole damn galaxy.

240
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:44,363
And this is my office, Bob, not yours,

241
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:47,962
no matter what you may think you did
to make this happen.

242
00:19:48,047 --> 00:19:52,962
And don't you ever,
for one second, forget that.

243
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:56,244
Yes, Mr President.

244
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,286
Let's take a break.

245
00:20:11,407 --> 00:20:16,242
According to the military,
SGC is our first and best line of defence

246
00:20:16,327 --> 00:20:19,205
against potential alien threats
to this planet.

247
00:20:19,287 --> 00:20:23,200
If that's true,
we should be very, very concerned.

248
00:20:23,287 --> 00:20:27,519
Time and again, Hammond and SG-1 have
demonstrated shockingly poor judgement,

249
00:20:27,607 --> 00:20:32,635
placing themselves, the base,
this very planet, in jeopardy.

250
00:20:32,727 --> 00:20:37,596
The decision to bring back
suspect technology through the gate

251
00:20:37,687 --> 00:20:40,326
has precipitated
a number of crisis situations.

252
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:43,479
For the most part,
they've been dealt within the SGC.

253
00:20:43,567 --> 00:20:48,766
However, last year the effect
of an alien device broke containment

254
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:52,442
and found its way
into the civilian population.

255
00:20:53,167 --> 00:20:55,158
Son of a...

256
00:20:57,247 --> 00:21:01,559
Sir, I believe an individual I came in
contact with has breached the quarantine.

257
00:21:07,727 --> 00:21:10,924
The situation was taken care of.
A cover story was created.

258
00:21:11,007 --> 00:21:13,646
The civilian population
was none the wiser.

259
00:21:13,727 --> 00:21:17,515
I would like to know how many times
we'll have to clean up after these people.

260
00:21:17,607 --> 00:21:22,727
They have a mandate to acquire offworld
technology. That entails necessary risks.

261
00:21:22,807 --> 00:21:24,718
How would you define necessary?

262
00:21:24,807 --> 00:21:27,196
Only a few months ago,
General Hammond allowed

263
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:30,040
the testing
of an unproven computer virus

264
00:21:30,127 --> 00:21:35,076
that shut down our entire gate network,
leaving us open to a potential assault.

265
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:41,163
You can't hold Hammond responsible.
It was a Goa'uld modification of the virus.

266
00:21:41,247 --> 00:21:48,005
In other words, Hammond effectively gave
the Goa'uld a weapon to use against us.

267
00:21:48,087 --> 00:21:50,043
Like the president said,

268
00:21:50,127 --> 00:21:54,598
you can't even begin to understand
what their jobs demand of them.

269
00:21:54,687 --> 00:21:58,999
Maybe not, but I would like to think
that it includes common sense

270
00:21:59,087 --> 00:22:02,443
and the willingness to set aside
personal feelings in battle.

271
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:06,679
- What are you referring to, Mr Woolsey?
- An incident three years ago.

272
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:11,522
General Hammond allowed emotion to
override established gate-room protocol.

273
00:22:17,527 --> 00:22:19,518
Evacuate the gate room.

274
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,755
Colonel O'Neill, we're taking fire. Report.

275
00:22:31,647 --> 00:22:33,638
Colonel O'Neill?

276
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,478
Sir?

277
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:40,395
Give them some more time.

278
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:55,402
General Hammond's decision
to wait for SG-1 worked out in the end,

279
00:22:55,487 --> 00:23:00,038
but I can't help but wonder
if he'll be so lucky the next time.

280
00:23:00,807 --> 00:23:05,437
The members of SG-1 have similarly
suspect priorities - and no wonder.

281
00:23:05,527 --> 00:23:09,964
Not one, but two people that Dr Jackson
had close personal relationships with

282
00:23:10,047 --> 00:23:12,083
were taken as Goa'uld hosts.

283
00:23:12,167 --> 00:23:15,637
Teal'c's family and associates
among the ranks of the Jaffa

284
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:20,517
make him an easy target
for Goa'uld retaliation and manipulation.

285
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,360
Both O'Neill and Carter
have demonstrated

286
00:23:23,447 --> 00:23:29,158
an alarming tendency to let relationships
cloud their decision-making process.

287
00:23:29,247 --> 00:23:32,683
They have a right to their feelings.

288
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:40,355
Unless, of course, you're suggesting...
some kind of inappropriate relationship.

289
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:44,884
Inappropriate, yes.
That is exactly what he's suggesting.

290
00:23:46,327 --> 00:23:50,081
It's difficult to come away from
these reports without the impression

291
00:23:50,167 --> 00:23:54,240
that there's a lot more going on
between Colonel O'Neill and Major Carter

292
00:23:54,327 --> 00:23:57,797
than simple friendship and respect.

293
00:23:57,887 --> 00:24:04,042
For example, there was an incident
last year in which O'Neill went missing.

294
00:24:04,127 --> 00:24:08,200
Based on a report filed by one of the
scientists on the mission in question,

295
00:24:08,287 --> 00:24:11,484
Major Carter's behaviour
was erratic at best.

296
00:24:13,687 --> 00:24:16,804
This technology
is unlike anything we've come across.

297
00:24:16,887 --> 00:24:19,879
- I know.
- No reference, no way to interface.

298
00:24:19,967 --> 00:24:23,755
I'm working on it, Doctor.
As you should be.

299
00:24:25,447 --> 00:24:27,119
Right.

300
00:24:28,687 --> 00:24:31,838
Excuse me. Where's Colonel O'Neill?

301
00:24:31,927 --> 00:24:36,079
I don't see him, do you?
Did you guys find him while I was gone?

302
00:24:36,167 --> 00:24:38,761
I say when we're done here.

303
00:24:41,607 --> 00:24:44,519
That's it? That's your evidence?

304
00:24:44,607 --> 00:24:48,600
I believe there's a lot more to this
than we've been told.

305
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:55,399
But I hardly expect them to incriminate
themselves with their own reports.

306
00:24:55,487 --> 00:24:58,126
But we can all read between the lines.

307
00:25:01,007 --> 00:25:04,204
All right, I've heard enough.
Thank you, gentlemen.

308
00:25:04,287 --> 00:25:07,836
- Thank you, Mr Woolsey.
- Mr President.

309
00:25:18,847 --> 00:25:21,998
- Mr Woolsey is here to see you, sir.
- Send him in.

310
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:29,796
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

311
00:25:31,287 --> 00:25:36,998
- That was nice work today, Richard.
- Really? I got the feeling it didn't go well.

312
00:25:37,087 --> 00:25:42,115
- Ah, well. Doesn't matter.
- It doesn't?

313
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,563
Nah. The president
is going to come around.

314
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,998
I didn't get that impression,
Mr Vice President.

315
00:25:50,087 --> 00:25:55,844
In fact, I clearly sensed that he was siding
with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.

316
00:25:55,927 --> 00:26:02,560
Today was a formality. Don't get me
wrong. The job you did was vital.

317
00:26:02,647 --> 00:26:08,324
The president has to appear to be hearing
both sides, considering his position,

318
00:26:08,407 --> 00:26:11,046
but...

319
00:26:11,127 --> 00:26:13,197
he'll see things my way eventually.

320
00:26:13,287 --> 00:26:15,642
And if he doesn't?

321
00:26:18,007 --> 00:26:19,998
Things happen.

322
00:26:22,127 --> 00:26:25,005
What is that supposed to mean?

323
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:30,117
It means
you chose the right side, Richard.

324
00:26:31,567 --> 00:26:38,643
One way or another, I promise you,
I'm going to win this one.

325
00:26:48,807 --> 00:26:52,436
- Mr President.
- General.

326
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,405
I take it you're here
to make a case for the defence?

327
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:58,638
I'm not going to get
into a point-counterpoint.

328
00:26:58,727 --> 00:27:01,366
It may very well be
that Hammond and SG-1

329
00:27:01,447 --> 00:27:04,484
have done their very best
under difficult circumstances,

330
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:09,687
but there's a political aspect to the vice
president's position that makes sense.

331
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:12,878
Sir?

332
00:27:16,727 --> 00:27:21,847
A lot of people know about Stargate.
We can't keep it a secret forever.

333
00:27:21,927 --> 00:27:25,966
When it finally comes out,
we're going to be in the fight of our lives.

334
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:28,481
We'll need the public's confidence.

335
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:32,560
You think cleaning house at the SGC now
shows you're in control?

336
00:27:32,647 --> 00:27:34,558
You disagree?

337
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:36,842
I think there's time for that still, sir.

338
00:27:36,927 --> 00:27:40,761
For the immediate future, I'm here
to let you know what you're up against,

339
00:27:40,847 --> 00:27:44,726
and why we need Hammond
and SG-1 right now more than ever.

340
00:27:44,807 --> 00:27:46,638
Have a seat. Fire away.

341
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:59,041
The System Lords have proven
themselves to be formidable adversaries.

342
00:27:59,127 --> 00:28:01,357
Yet, despite our obvious disadvantage,

343
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:05,122
we've managed to hold our own, maybe
even take them down a notch or two.

344
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:09,519
We've been good, and we've been lucky.
But I'm afraid that could change.

345
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:12,041
There's a new Goa'uld in the mix.

346
00:28:12,127 --> 00:28:15,881
I take it you're referring to the one
who calls himself Anubis.

347
00:28:15,967 --> 00:28:19,084
He's more powerful
than any of his predecessors.

348
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:22,682
He came to our attention a year ago
when he tried to take out Earth

349
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:26,999
with an asteroid and then used
our own Stargate as a weapon against us.

350
00:28:27,087 --> 00:28:29,237
We thwarted him both times.

351
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:32,364
Since then,
he's redirected his attention to his rivals,

352
00:28:32,447 --> 00:28:35,120
waging a year-long war
against the Goa'uld.

353
00:28:37,847 --> 00:28:39,838
Your time is up.

354
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:59,280
Well, good.
Let them fight amongst themselves.

355
00:28:59,367 --> 00:29:04,122
The problem is, when he's through
with them, and it's only a matter of time,

356
00:29:04,207 --> 00:29:09,679
he'll come gunning for us. And when he
does, we'll be facing a whole new threat.

357
00:29:28,287 --> 00:29:30,243
Fire in the hole!

358
00:29:38,687 --> 00:29:40,996
A super soldier?

359
00:29:41,087 --> 00:29:44,045
Not just one. He's got a whole army.

360
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:47,961
Hail Anubis. Hail Anubis.

361
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:54,160
If that's true, I can't imagine
how having SG-1 on the front lines

362
00:29:54,247 --> 00:29:57,159
is gonna make one bit
of difference when the time comes.

363
00:29:57,247 --> 00:30:01,126
Anubis may be incredibly powerful,
but he's not invincible.

364
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:04,165
- There is a way to take him out.
- And how's that?

365
00:30:04,247 --> 00:30:06,317
By finding the lost city.

366
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:13,003
You have to forgive me, Francis. I've only
gone through about a third of those files.

367
00:30:13,087 --> 00:30:19,037
The gates were built by a highly advanced
race of aliens known as the Ancients.

368
00:30:19,127 --> 00:30:24,201
They died off millions of years ago,
but they haven't disappeared completely.

369
00:30:42,527 --> 00:30:44,836
They've evolved into higher life forms.

370
00:30:44,927 --> 00:30:46,838
- Well, will they help us?
- No, sir.

371
00:30:46,927 --> 00:30:49,839
- Why the hell not?
- It's beneath them.

372
00:30:49,927 --> 00:30:53,920
They won't involve themselves
in our affairs.

373
00:30:54,007 --> 00:30:56,999
So where are you going with this?

374
00:30:57,087 --> 00:31:02,559
Last year, SG-1 made an amazing
discovery on a planet called Abydos.

375
00:31:02,647 --> 00:31:05,445
You're gonna find
the lost city of the Ancients.

376
00:31:05,527 --> 00:31:09,315
- Lost city?
- Didn't tell him about that either, huh?

377
00:31:09,407 --> 00:31:11,841
Daniel found a tablet about a lost city.

378
00:31:11,927 --> 00:31:15,602
With powerful weapons capable
of giving you a big advantage over Anubis.

379
00:31:15,687 --> 00:31:18,645
- Do you know where it is?
- No, but I'll help you find it.

380
00:31:18,727 --> 00:31:25,963
Hammond and SG-1 are close to finding
the lost city. Let them do their job, sir.

381
00:31:26,047 --> 00:31:28,880
Let them save this planet one more time.

382
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,322
I wish it were that simple.

383
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:46,322
I'm not sure what you mean, sir.

384
00:31:46,407 --> 00:31:50,639
The vice president may be a pain
in the ass, but I can't just ignore him.

385
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:53,287
You're commander-in-chief.
It's your decision.

386
00:31:53,367 --> 00:31:55,756
True.

387
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:58,998
But if I cross him on this one...

388
00:31:59,087 --> 00:32:04,559
Well, let's just say
that I haven't viewed all the angles yet.

389
00:32:05,887 --> 00:32:09,482
- Is there anything you haven't told me?
- No, sir.

390
00:32:11,727 --> 00:32:16,084
Then as far as I can tell, Hammond and
SG-1 have done an extraordinary job

391
00:32:16,167 --> 00:32:18,635
under very difficult circumstances.

392
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:22,720
But in doing so
they've made some mistakes.

393
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:25,446
They've made some enemies.

394
00:32:25,527 --> 00:32:28,564
Frankly,
I don't know if I can protect them.

395
00:32:46,607 --> 00:32:48,518
- General.
- Mr Woolsey.

396
00:32:48,607 --> 00:32:50,438
Thank you for meeting me.

397
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:53,360
The vice president
doesn't know about this?

398
00:32:53,447 --> 00:32:56,041
No. And I'd like to keep it that way.

399
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,400
What do you want?

400
00:33:00,487 --> 00:33:02,682
I want to warn you.

401
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:09,320
I think the vice president may be involved
with people capable of... well, anything.

402
00:33:09,407 --> 00:33:15,004
I believe they attempted assassination at
least once before to get what they wanted.

403
00:33:15,087 --> 00:33:17,999
Do you realize the seriousness
of what you just said?

404
00:33:18,087 --> 00:33:20,396
Yes, sir.

405
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:26,323
Look, no matter what you think of me,
I consider myself to be a man of integrity.

406
00:33:26,407 --> 00:33:29,444
I took the job with the NID
because I strongly believe

407
00:33:29,527 --> 00:33:32,325
in civilian oversight of military operations.

408
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:34,523
- Mr Woolsey.
- I don't have any proof, sir.

409
00:33:34,607 --> 00:33:41,240
But I'm starting to question whether those
to whom I have dedicated my allegiance

410
00:33:41,327 --> 00:33:44,524
are as honourable as I had hoped.

411
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,440
You're a resourceful man, Mr Woolsey.

412
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:53,361
If you think there's proof out there, find it.

413
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:12,407
Hammond.

414
00:34:12,487 --> 00:34:15,081
Show him in.

415
00:34:20,167 --> 00:34:21,600
General.

416
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:26,044
This must be important
for you to have come all this way.

417
00:34:26,127 --> 00:34:28,561
I know you have
no reason to trust me, General.

418
00:34:28,647 --> 00:34:32,037
That's why I felt
I had to come here in person.

419
00:34:32,127 --> 00:34:34,516
Sit down.

420
00:34:38,527 --> 00:34:40,916
I take great pride in my work, General.

421
00:34:41,007 --> 00:34:43,521
My job demands meticulous research.

422
00:34:43,607 --> 00:34:47,122
And above all else,
impartiality in its execution.

423
00:34:47,207 --> 00:34:49,596
My aim is to present an airtight argument,

424
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:52,155
a point of view for consideration
by those I serve

425
00:34:52,247 --> 00:34:54,238
with no personal agenda whatsoever.

426
00:34:54,327 --> 00:34:56,795
Get to the point.

427
00:34:56,887 --> 00:35:01,642
I stand by my case against you and your
personnel, despite what I'm about to say.

428
00:35:01,727 --> 00:35:04,958
I hope you don't expect
that to gain my respect.

429
00:35:08,007 --> 00:35:13,081
You recall the assassination attempt
on then Senator Kinsey?

430
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:25,964
The senator's been hit. He's been hit.

431
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:30,762
I later gained notoriety from bringing
those responsible to justice.

432
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:34,522
I can only assume you're going
somewhere with this.

433
00:35:34,607 --> 00:35:37,485
Let's just say I've recently come to believe

434
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:43,403
that those behind the rogue element of
the NID have not entirely been eliminated.

435
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:45,523
In fact, they may be stronger than ever,

436
00:35:45,607 --> 00:35:48,679
and Vice President Kinsey
may still be tied to them.

437
00:35:48,767 --> 00:35:53,921
They tried to have him killed, then he tried
to take them down. Seems unlikely.

438
00:35:54,007 --> 00:35:57,317
At the time, something must have
made Kinsey a liability.

439
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:00,956
After the assassination attempt,
the opportunity presented itself

440
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:03,720
to propel Kinsey
onto the presidential ticket.

441
00:36:03,807 --> 00:36:06,116
That could have
motivated a reconciliation.

442
00:36:06,207 --> 00:36:09,165
Either way, I'm not surprised
by any of this, Mr Woolsey.

443
00:36:09,247 --> 00:36:13,684
Well, I'm sorry to say that I am, and I want
to do something about it if I can.

444
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:17,840
- Like what?
- Like present evidence, if there is any,

445
00:36:17,927 --> 00:36:22,079
connecting Kinsey to illegal activity
involving those behind the rogue NID.

446
00:36:22,167 --> 00:36:25,364
What makes you think
evidence like that exists?

447
00:36:25,447 --> 00:36:28,245
- Because you're sitting right there.
- I'm sorry?

448
00:36:28,327 --> 00:36:32,923
Three years ago, you left SGC,
supposedly retired.

449
00:36:33,007 --> 00:36:37,523
- I'm guessing you were blackmailed.
- And?

450
00:36:37,607 --> 00:36:39,677
And then you came back.

451
00:36:39,767 --> 00:36:43,077
Nothing about that
ever made any sense to me.

452
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:46,398
I want to know why, how.

453
00:36:47,647 --> 00:36:52,243
You've got something on Kinsey,
something I can use.

454
00:36:55,127 --> 00:37:00,121
That's it, we're in.
I'm downloading now.

455
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:07,995
Kinsey's online activities connect him to
NID actions over the last year and a half,

456
00:37:08,087 --> 00:37:13,957
including a secret operation I ran out of
Area 51, involvement with the Russians...

457
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:18,478
and the threats to Hammond.

458
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:23,595
You're a piece of work, Kinsey.
Tried to shut down the SGC.

459
00:37:23,687 --> 00:37:26,884
You make this big speech
about hating secret organisations,

460
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:29,003
then jump in bed with the NID?

461
00:37:29,087 --> 00:37:31,157
I'm done.

462
00:37:37,647 --> 00:37:41,799
What are you going to do?
Take down the whole NID?

463
00:37:41,887 --> 00:37:43,639
Nope.

464
00:37:44,727 --> 00:37:50,882
Here's the deal. Get them to reinstate
Hammond or this disk goes to the press.

465
00:37:55,647 --> 00:38:00,277
You've got connections, General.
You must know what's going down.

466
00:38:13,487 --> 00:38:15,921
That's not the only copy.

467
00:38:17,967 --> 00:38:20,561
Why haven't you given this
to someone before now?

468
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:22,683
I didn't know who to trust.

469
00:38:24,607 --> 00:38:27,167
I still don't.

470
00:38:42,927 --> 00:38:44,918
Yes, sir, right away.

471
00:38:45,847 --> 00:38:49,522
- The president will see you now.
- Thank you.

472
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:01,841
Thank you for seeing me, Mr President.

473
00:39:01,927 --> 00:39:06,398
Is there something you wanted
to add to your report, Mr Woolsey?

474
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:09,001
Yes, sir.

475
00:39:13,647 --> 00:39:18,038
As I'm sure you're aware, the NID
does not exactly have a spotless record.

476
00:39:18,127 --> 00:39:22,996
For several years, a group of rogue
agents operated inside of its ranks.

477
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:26,682
They acted on behalf of a cabal
of international business interests

478
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:30,123
intent on acquiring alien technology
for their own profit.

479
00:39:30,207 --> 00:39:34,405
- One could only hope.
- Mr President?

480
00:39:35,527 --> 00:39:37,882
I know they're out there, Mr Woolsey.

481
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:44,440
I'm saying that one could only hope
that money was their chief motivation.

482
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:50,001
However, I doubt
the type of person who is behind this

483
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:54,922
is short-sighted enough for that,
given what he must know.

484
00:39:55,007 --> 00:39:59,797
In light of the new reality
that Stargate presents,

485
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:06,486
there are aspirations beyond mere
financial greed that could be much worse.

486
00:40:07,767 --> 00:40:10,201
I agree.

487
00:40:10,287 --> 00:40:14,075
You're here to tell me that the vice
president is still in league with them?

488
00:40:14,167 --> 00:40:18,604
If these people are as powerful as
we both think, it does make one wonder

489
00:40:18,687 --> 00:40:24,045
what the vice president offered them
in exchange for the price on his head.
