1
00:00:09,367 --> 00:00:11,403
General, what's this all about?

2
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:15,116
At 0920 hours this morning, someone
tried to enter the base using this.

3
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:18,961
- Colonel O'Neill's security ID.
- After he was taken into custody,

4
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:22,164
- he insisted on seeing you.
- Me? Why?

5
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:26,559
I was hoping you could figure
that one out, Major. Open it.

6
00:00:32,607 --> 00:00:35,121
Thank you.
Now we're getting somewhere.

7
00:00:35,207 --> 00:00:38,244
Sergeant, that coffee
I asked for half an hour ago.

8
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:41,319
Anytime you feel like getting it...

9
00:00:45,327 --> 00:00:46,965
He's a boy, sir.

10
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:51,676
As it turns out, Carter, yes, I am.
For the moment.

11
00:00:53,007 --> 00:00:54,918
Do I know you?

12
00:00:55,007 --> 00:00:56,838
Come on.

13
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:59,157
It's me.

14
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:03,160
We tried to contact Colonel O'Neill,
even sent someone to his house.

15
00:01:03,247 --> 00:01:05,886
Do you understand
how much trouble you're in?

16
00:01:05,967 --> 00:01:10,995
Impersonating a military officer
is a federal offence.

17
00:01:11,087 --> 00:01:14,636
I am not impersonating anyone.

18
00:01:16,647 --> 00:01:19,445
I am Jack O'Neill.

19
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:35,920
Finally.

20
00:02:43,167 --> 00:02:46,477
Hot chocolate? Are you kidding?

21
00:02:48,567 --> 00:02:50,956
Where did you get this?

22
00:02:51,047 --> 00:02:55,325
I didn't... I didn't get it anywhere. It's mine.

23
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:58,479
- Because you're Colonel O'Neill.
- Exactly.

24
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:07,485
Last night I ate some dinner, had a beer,
went to bed, and woke up like this.

25
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:11,082
Can we please get to the part
where you and Fraiser run some tests,

26
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:14,284
find a cure, make me big again?

27
00:03:14,367 --> 00:03:18,724
- This is the security breach?
- Daniel, tell them who I am, please.

28
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:20,718
OK, love to. Who are you?

29
00:03:21,687 --> 00:03:26,158
This young man
claims he's Colonel O'Neill.

30
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,761
It's a joke, right?

31
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,003
- What's going on?
- Daniel!

32
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:36,646
Sounds like him -
at least the loud, grating parts.

33
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:38,763
OK. You want proof?

34
00:03:38,847 --> 00:03:42,920
Carter, you once carried a Tok'ra named
Jolinar who gave her life to save you.

35
00:03:43,007 --> 00:03:45,805
Daniel, until recently
you were an ascended being.

36
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:49,596
You broke the rules, you got
kicked out of the Oma Desala fan club,

37
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,245
and had your memory erased.

38
00:03:51,327 --> 00:03:55,445
And you and Bra'tac both just
lost your snakes in a Goa'uld ambush.

39
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,758
Had your tretonin yet this morning?

40
00:04:06,487 --> 00:04:10,241
How could this child
possess such knowledge?

41
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:17,155
Because it's me.

42
00:04:25,647 --> 00:04:31,961
Anyone care to speculate how a boy
could be aware of classified information?

43
00:04:32,047 --> 00:04:35,357
- Well, sir, it could be him.
- There is a physical resemblance.

44
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:37,881
But he can't be more than 15 years old.

45
00:04:37,967 --> 00:04:41,926
Are you saying Colonel O'Neill has
regressed more than 30 years overnight?

46
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:44,965
- Stranger things have happened.
- Name but one.

47
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:48,881
The time he got really old, the time
he became a caveman, the time we all...

48
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:52,277
Why don't we move on to
the testing portion of this exercise?

49
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:58,916
- Are you certain, Doctor?
- Within an acceptable margin of error,

50
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,556
the boy's DNA is virtually identical
to Colonel O'Neill's.

51
00:05:02,647 --> 00:05:05,878
- What size margin of error?
- Very small.

52
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:08,162
In a court of law,
the DNA sample we took

53
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:12,877
would be considered a high-probability
match to that of Colonel O'Neill.

54
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:17,483
There is a tiny abnormality,
but for all intents and purposes, it's him.

55
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:21,924
"Tiny abnormality" - like the fact he's a
few years younger than he's meant to be?

56
00:05:22,007 --> 00:05:25,522
To be honest, this is out of my league.
We've got specialists flying in.

57
00:05:25,607 --> 00:05:27,802
We'll run more tests,
see what we can learn.

58
00:05:27,887 --> 00:05:31,323
In the meantime, we'll try
to make him as comfortable as possible.

59
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:33,682
I'll go set up a PlayStation.

60
00:05:39,687 --> 00:05:44,363
You know... I think you two
are enjoying this just a little too much.

61
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:46,677
Well, you are kinda cute.

62
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,083
That's "sir" to you.

63
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:56,197
And being trapped inside a scrawny
little body isn't my idea of cute, Carter.

64
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,646
Does possessing a younger body
not have certain advantages, O'Neill?

65
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:03,400
No. Not seeing it. What do you mean?

66
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:07,116
Do you not experience
increased health and vitality?

67
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,764
My vitality was just fine, thank you.

68
00:06:14,247 --> 00:06:16,681
I think what Teal'c is saying is valid.

69
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:20,806
How many of us wouldn't trade everything
for the chance to live our lives over?

70
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:24,323
Yeah, well, I don't plan
on staying like this.

71
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:28,719
Well, in the meantime,
may I make a suggestion?

72
00:06:28,807 --> 00:06:32,277
Try enjoying this as much as we are.

73
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:34,076
Sir.

74
00:06:59,447 --> 00:07:02,166
It's nice to know
some things don't change.

75
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:04,761
I wasn't exactly expecting visitors.

76
00:07:04,847 --> 00:07:07,361
We'll send this stuff to the lab for analysis.

77
00:07:07,447 --> 00:07:12,202
Well, if they find MSG,
I will never order from them again.

78
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:14,319
What are we doing here exactly?

79
00:07:14,407 --> 00:07:17,717
This is the last place
you remember being...

80
00:07:19,327 --> 00:07:21,522
Older?

81
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:24,280
Are you conducting
a scientific experiment, O'Neill?

82
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:27,165
Come on. That salsa's still good.

83
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:37,240
What was the last thing you ate, sir?

84
00:07:38,527 --> 00:07:41,678
Four cheese burritos,
some guacamole on the side.

85
00:07:41,767 --> 00:07:45,476
- Anything else?
- A beer. Then I hit the sack.

86
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:51,844
So whatever happened to you must
have occurred once you were asleep.

87
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:06,555
Hey! Do you mind?

88
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,278
Teal'c!

89
00:08:24,447 --> 00:08:25,766
Whoa.

90
00:08:27,327 --> 00:08:29,477
- O'Neill.
- What is it?

91
00:08:33,727 --> 00:08:37,925
Either I'm remembering
a particularly bad dream,

92
00:08:39,127 --> 00:08:42,483
or the Asgard paid me
a little visit last night.

93
00:08:50,487 --> 00:08:53,001
What you're saying
makes no sense.

94
00:08:53,087 --> 00:08:57,046
Jack's account sounds like a number
of UFO abduction case files I've read.

95
00:08:57,127 --> 00:09:00,722
This you remember.
My birthday you forget.

96
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,797
Looks like you'll have a lot more.

97
00:09:03,887 --> 00:09:07,641
This encounter is incongruous
with all previous contact with the Asgard.

98
00:09:07,727 --> 00:09:12,278
Thor has indicated that the Asgard kept
an eye on human development on Earth.

99
00:09:12,367 --> 00:09:15,916
But we're allies now. We've
cooperated on a number of missions.

100
00:09:16,007 --> 00:09:20,125
- This I would not have agreed to.
- What could they possibly hope to gain

101
00:09:20,207 --> 00:09:24,598
from secretly making you younger
against your will?

102
00:09:26,687 --> 00:09:29,201
I got nothing.

103
00:09:29,287 --> 00:09:33,644
I'd like to cross-reference the abduction
accounts, see if I can find a connection.

104
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:38,198
Please do. Major, I believe you have
a briefing to run at 1300 hours.

105
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,199
- Yes, sir. I'll be there.
- The F-302 briefing?

106
00:09:41,287 --> 00:09:45,599
- I thought I was running that.
- It would be best if the major handled it.

107
00:09:45,687 --> 00:09:48,963
I'm sure you can impart
any information she needs to know.

108
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:52,403
- But I'm the one who...
- Good. Dismissed.

109
00:10:01,527 --> 00:10:03,518
Come in.

110
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:11,439
Jack, try to understand. Your situation
puts me in a very difficult position.

111
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:15,156
No offence, but you're not the one
who went to bed watching CNN

112
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:17,602
and woke up
as part of the MTV generation.

113
00:10:17,687 --> 00:10:20,360
Which is why Major Carter's
handling that briefing.

114
00:10:20,447 --> 00:10:22,677
I've flown the 302 more than anyone else.

115
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:25,600
Be that as it may, the bottom line is,

116
00:10:25,687 --> 00:10:32,240
a room full of seasoned pilots aren't
going to respect the opinion of a boy.

117
00:10:32,327 --> 00:10:35,763
Sir, I just look like one for the moment.

118
00:10:35,847 --> 00:10:38,919
But those men in that room
need my expertise.

119
00:10:39,007 --> 00:10:43,558
And if they're gonna be working here,
they're gonna have to get used to...

120
00:10:43,647 --> 00:10:46,161
- unusual things happening.
- Look, Jack.

121
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:50,684
No one is disputing that you may continue
to be a valuable asset to the SGC.

122
00:10:50,767 --> 00:10:56,444
But under the circumstances,
there's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

123
00:10:57,447 --> 00:10:59,642
Yes, sir. I understand.

124
00:11:03,207 --> 00:11:05,198
Dumb idea.

125
00:11:07,767 --> 00:11:12,045
It would appear that many Tauri have
encountered beings from other worlds.

126
00:11:12,127 --> 00:11:16,166
Little do they know
how close they are to the truth.

127
00:11:16,247 --> 00:11:18,715
What exactly are we looking for,
Daniel Jackson?

128
00:11:18,807 --> 00:11:21,480
Any abduction accounts
that match Jack's story,

129
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:26,038
and anyone claiming to have physically
regressed several decades overnight.

130
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:30,598
- We need to enter our search parameters.
- It has already been done.

131
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,076
Wow! That's a lot of people.

132
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:37,842
Indeed.

133
00:11:37,927 --> 00:11:44,082
Let's see if any of these match Jack's
story. He said he saw four green lights.

134
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:48,602
That's a little more reasonable.

135
00:11:48,687 --> 00:11:53,044
That's interesting. Of the narrowed-down
accounts, the most recent is from...

136
00:11:53,127 --> 00:11:57,086
- 19 years ago.
- Eight are here in the States.

137
00:11:57,167 --> 00:12:01,558
If these addresses are still valid,
we should talk to these people in person.

138
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:07,040
- What do you hope to learn?
- I guess we'll know when we learn it.

139
00:12:09,607 --> 00:12:15,000
As your intel packages show, the F-302 is
a spaceworthy fighter-interceptor aircraft

140
00:12:15,087 --> 00:12:18,124
reverse-engineered
from Goa'uld technology.

141
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:21,563
Your upcoming mission has been dubbed
"Operation Blue Phoenix".

142
00:12:21,647 --> 00:12:26,675
It'll be a live-fire combat simulation to
test the 302 against actual death gliders.

143
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:29,201
- Captain?
- According to our mission reports,

144
00:12:29,287 --> 00:12:31,926
you were second seat
on the most recent 302 mission.

145
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:36,683
Yes, and it included close combat. We'll
cover what was learned in that encounter.

146
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:41,716
- Didn't Colonel O'Neill pilot that mission?
- Yes, as a matter of fact he did.

147
00:12:41,807 --> 00:12:47,723
He also commanded the X-302 on both
hyperspace window missions, didn't he?

148
00:12:47,807 --> 00:12:49,638
What's your point, Major?

149
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:52,719
With respect, ma'am,
shouldn't he be running this briefing?

150
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:56,925
Colonel O'Neill is unavailable.
However, I have several computer models

151
00:12:57,007 --> 00:13:00,636
to help you understand
how the 302 handles in combat situations.

152
00:13:00,727 --> 00:13:06,199
No offence, but those won't help me
when I'm pulling 6G's in a dogfight.

153
00:13:06,287 --> 00:13:11,281
As you should know, Captain,
the 302 has inertial dampening systems

154
00:13:11,367 --> 00:13:15,155
which I am more than qualified
to explain in detail, so let's just...

155
00:13:15,247 --> 00:13:19,479
- I just dropped by to say... Ow!
- Sir, please do not resist.

156
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,558
...stay focused.

157
00:13:21,647 --> 00:13:23,524
- OK, I'm warning you.
- Sir...

158
00:13:23,607 --> 00:13:26,644
Didn't I just say I was warning you?
Hey! Ooh!

159
00:13:26,727 --> 00:13:29,321
That's it! Now I'm mad.

160
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:32,962
You can release him.

161
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:41,804
I'll forgo the charges
for assaulting a superior officer.

162
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:43,878
Carter.

163
00:13:45,767 --> 00:13:48,759
- Could have taken 'em.
- I'm sure.

164
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:51,156
Sorry I'm late. What'd I miss?

165
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,841
We were covering
the 302's flight capabilities.

166
00:13:53,927 --> 00:13:55,918
Then here's what you need to know.

167
00:13:56,007 --> 00:14:00,523
- Major, is this a joke?
- No, this is... Colonel O'Neill.

168
00:14:01,687 --> 00:14:06,761
I'm only gonna say this once,
so I'd suggest that you listen up.

169
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,246
- Whatever you say.
- Hey!

170
00:14:08,327 --> 00:14:13,196
I realise that it doesn't actually say
"Colonel" on my uniform, but it should.

171
00:14:17,807 --> 00:14:19,445
Yes, sir.

172
00:14:22,047 --> 00:14:25,881
Now, velocity is key
during engagement with a glider.

173
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:29,437
Your instincts tell you to floor it
because it's more manoeuvrable,

174
00:14:29,527 --> 00:14:32,758
but you've got to stay in control.

175
00:14:32,847 --> 00:14:38,956
The inertial dampeners only compensate
90% when pulling negative G's,

176
00:14:39,047 --> 00:14:44,804
so the real trick is knowing your enemy,
so you can anticipate their next moves.

177
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:47,918
OK.

178
00:14:50,527 --> 00:14:52,597
Death gliders 101.

179
00:14:56,247 --> 00:14:58,841
May I ask why the United States Air Force

180
00:14:58,927 --> 00:15:03,284
has taken a renewed interest
in my story after 26 years?

181
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:06,598
All I can tell you is that
we have some new information.

182
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:10,282
- Will it prove my story true?
- Eventually.

183
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:14,486
- Maybe.
- Please tell us what happened to you.

184
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:19,918
I was asleep in my bed, and a light
appeared in my room and took me.

185
00:15:20,327 --> 00:15:24,286
- Took you where?
- Some kind of spacecraft, I suppose.

186
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:28,360
I was weightless,
floating in midair, and yet...

187
00:15:28,447 --> 00:15:33,840
It was dark, cold. I couldn't move
a muscle even though I was wide awake.

188
00:15:33,927 --> 00:15:36,885
- After the light hit you, then what?
- The devices came.

189
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:40,755
They were these green glowing balls
that floated around me.

190
00:15:43,327 --> 00:15:46,558
After the small green spheres
stopped scanning him...

191
00:15:46,647 --> 00:15:49,684
...they left him alone for a long while.

192
00:15:53,007 --> 00:15:56,477
And then a voice spoke to him,
telling him not to be afraid,

193
00:15:56,567 --> 00:16:02,039
- and that he would soon be safe again.
- Did Professor Wu see who spoke to him?

194
00:16:11,527 --> 00:16:15,406
All the accounts are basically identical.
They match Jack's version of events.

195
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:19,002
Except none of them experienced
any physical changes as a result.

196
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:23,239
But everything else is bang on - taken
while sleeping, out-of-body experience.

197
00:16:23,327 --> 00:16:27,002
All this does sound familiar -
cliché even, if you watch enough TV.

198
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:33,117
But they all described four green globes
buzzing around them like insects.

199
00:16:33,207 --> 00:16:36,119
That's too specific a detail
to be a coincidence.

200
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:40,041
The being that abducted them - I assume
they described an Asgard as well.

201
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:42,277
Short, big eyes, no hair, weird voice.

202
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:46,963
The Asgard haven't responded
to our attempted communications.

203
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:49,481
If help is coming, it better arrive soon.

204
00:16:55,327 --> 00:16:57,716
It's open.

205
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,398
How are you doing?

206
00:17:04,607 --> 00:17:08,919
Well, I think I'm getting
another zit, and, uh...

207
00:17:09,007 --> 00:17:11,965
Oh! Yeah, I'm still a kid.

208
00:17:12,047 --> 00:17:16,438
But beyond that,
I'm doing just peachy, thanks. Why?

209
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,959
Well...

210
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:26,839
Janet just finished going over the genetic
team's analysis of your test results.

211
00:17:26,927 --> 00:17:29,202
How bad can it be?

212
00:17:30,207 --> 00:17:33,279
You're probably not feeling the effects yet,

213
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:37,519
but something is happening to your body
at the cellular level.

214
00:17:37,607 --> 00:17:43,204
Basically your genetic structure's
growing more unstable...

215
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,358
Colonel...

216
00:17:51,007 --> 00:17:53,077
you're dying.

217
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,883
Honestly, I feel fine.

218
00:18:10,967 --> 00:18:14,243
You'll start to notice symptoms
as the condition worsens.

219
00:18:14,327 --> 00:18:17,558
- How long do I have?
- It's hard to say.

220
00:18:19,207 --> 00:18:21,516
Say it anyway.

221
00:18:22,327 --> 00:18:24,795
Weeks, days, I don't know.

222
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:29,483
You'll notice fatigue first. In the end,
your body's vital organs will shut down.

223
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:35,199
It's like something inside you
is causing a total system failure.

224
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:40,758
I don't get it. We helped save
their skinny asses from the replicators,

225
00:18:40,847 --> 00:18:43,645
and as a thanks they shrink me
and leave me to die.

226
00:18:43,727 --> 00:18:46,764
We're exploring
every option we have, Colonel.

227
00:18:46,847 --> 00:18:49,520
We just need you to hang in there.

228
00:18:54,607 --> 00:18:57,599
Thanks for coming.
I'm sure it'll help coming from you.

229
00:18:57,687 --> 00:19:03,796
- How are Mark and the kids?
- Good. Great. I'll tell them you said hi.

230
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:14,046
I'm sorry. Sam told me
what was going on, but...

231
00:19:15,047 --> 00:19:17,641
What could anyone possibly
hope to gain from this?

232
00:19:17,727 --> 00:19:20,878
Can we just, uh... get on with it?

233
00:19:21,887 --> 00:19:23,878
I'm not getting any younger.

234
00:19:23,967 --> 00:19:27,755
Well, as I told Sam,
our options are pretty limited.

235
00:19:27,847 --> 00:19:29,838
You came all this way to say goodbye?

236
00:19:29,927 --> 00:19:33,124
At this point, I'm here
to recommend we put you in stasis

237
00:19:33,207 --> 00:19:36,722
- until we understand your condition.
- You wanna freeze me.

238
00:19:36,807 --> 00:19:40,083
We're not talking about cryogenics
as we know it here on Earth.

239
00:19:40,167 --> 00:19:42,761
The risk involved is minimal.

240
00:19:42,847 --> 00:19:46,044
I've been down this road
with the Tok'ra before.

241
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:50,245
No offence, Jacob, but the last time
you guys helped me out of a "jam",

242
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:54,286
I ended up rescuing an old girlfriend
I'd never met before.

243
00:19:54,367 --> 00:19:58,246
We would never subject you to another
blending without your permission.

244
00:19:58,327 --> 00:20:01,205
Good. Cos it's never gonna happen.

245
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:06,996
No pressure, Jack.
But you need to make a decision.

246
00:20:07,087 --> 00:20:09,442
We have a team standing by.

247
00:20:09,527 --> 00:20:11,518
But if you wait too long,

248
00:20:11,607 --> 00:20:15,156
we may not be able to reverse
the cellular breakdown.

249
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,965
Colonel, please.

250
00:20:22,287 --> 00:20:24,642
It's your choice, Jack.

251
00:20:26,567 --> 00:20:30,799
- Can I have five minutes to think about it?
- You can have ten, Colonel.

252
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:47,605
- Do you think he'll do it?
- If I have to drag him there myself.

253
00:20:47,687 --> 00:20:51,646
I didn't come all this way
to watch him die like this.

254
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:59,400
We have a security breach,
level 25, guest quarters.

255
00:21:24,207 --> 00:21:29,156
Security teams have swept the base
three times, inside and out.

256
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:32,922
They've found nothing. I think
it's safe to assume he's no longer here.

257
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:37,319
He knows the SGC as well as anyone.
If he wanted a way out, he'd find one.

258
00:21:37,407 --> 00:21:41,002
I've notified the authorities.
With any luck they'll find him soon.

259
00:21:41,087 --> 00:21:44,159
Sir? There's something
you all need to see.

260
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:49,757
Go on home, kid, before I call the cops.
It's a school night, for cryin' out loud.

261
00:21:49,847 --> 00:21:52,156
How about lite beer?

262
00:21:52,247 --> 00:21:54,238
Gimme a break.

263
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:08,042
Harley?

264
00:22:09,447 --> 00:22:11,836
- Excuse me?
- Yeah, Harlan Beck.

265
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,840
You served in Operation Proven Force
out of Incirlik.

266
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:19,522
Yeah, during the Gulf.
How'd you know that, kid?

267
00:22:19,607 --> 00:22:22,360
What, are you kidding? I ran...

268
00:22:26,087 --> 00:22:30,877
I mean, uh... my uncle
knew a Lieutenant Beck from the war.

269
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:36,200
Said he was a stand-up guy.
Flew an AC-130 gunship over Baghdad.

270
00:22:36,287 --> 00:22:39,324
Then your uncle
had to be in the Special Ops.

271
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:42,638
Yeah, he was. Colonel Jack O'Neill?

272
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:48,683
You're Jack O'Neill's nephew?
I didn't know he had a sibling.

273
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:52,841
Well... used to.

274
00:22:54,127 --> 00:22:59,121
Uncle Jack's been like a father to me
since my folks died.

275
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,678
So how's old Jack doin', anyway?

276
00:23:04,767 --> 00:23:08,237
He's fine. He's not that old, either.

277
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:13,805
Well, tell him... tell him
Harley said to watch his six.

278
00:23:13,887 --> 00:23:17,482
Hey. Yeah, uh... speaking of six...

279
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:21,321
Look, seeing as how
you know my uncle and all,

280
00:23:21,407 --> 00:23:24,524
you think you could do me a little favour?

281
00:23:31,887 --> 00:23:35,846
Selmak has had a chance to digest
some of the DNA test results,

282
00:23:35,927 --> 00:23:39,317
and it seems Colonel O'Neill's condition
isn't what we thought.

283
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:43,116
- He isn't dying?
- He is, but we think we know the cause.

284
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:48,235
When we first compared the DNA
samples, the match was almost perfect.

285
00:23:48,327 --> 00:23:54,357
- You said there was a tiny abnormality.
- Yes. Selmak thinks he knows why.

286
00:23:54,447 --> 00:23:57,120
This is not Colonel O'Neill.

287
00:23:57,207 --> 00:23:59,402
- But...
- He's a clone.

288
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:11,641
I see. Keep me informed.

289
00:24:15,367 --> 00:24:17,756
No word yet on...

290
00:24:19,287 --> 00:24:22,404
What exactly do we call him at this point?

291
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:25,875
Duplicate O'Neill?

292
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:29,198
Sir, we think we have a clearer idea
of what might be going on.

293
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:32,165
- Enlighten me.
- We know the Asgard clone themselves.

294
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:36,923
They clone their bodies, then transfer
their consciousness from one to the next.

295
00:24:37,007 --> 00:24:40,317
They suffer from grave diseases
due to thousands of years of cloning.

296
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:43,205
Leading to extinction
if they can't solve the problem

297
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:46,723
of diminishing returns
in their cloning technology.

298
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:49,196
What does this have to do
with Colonel O'Neill?

299
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:52,484
We had the abductees' DNA
that Teal'c and I interviewed

300
00:24:52,567 --> 00:24:55,923
scanned for the same abnormalities
as Duplicate O'Neill.

301
00:24:56,007 --> 00:24:58,680
As far as we can tell,
none of them are clones.

302
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,645
- Which means?
- In all likelihood, the Asgard responsible

303
00:25:01,727 --> 00:25:05,322
took the original people
and replaced them with duplicates.

304
00:25:05,407 --> 00:25:07,967
They study the originals
and then switch them back.

305
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:12,165
You think whoever took the real
Colonel O'Neill is going to return him?

306
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:14,044
It's all we've got, sir.

307
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:17,642
We're hoping the fact that the clone
didn't mature is a mistake.

308
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:19,319
What makes you think that?

309
00:25:19,407 --> 00:25:23,286
The previous actions of this Asgard
indicated his desire to remain covert.

310
00:25:23,367 --> 00:25:25,358
Jack's clone is a dead giveaway.

311
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:29,042
The Asgard doesn't know there's
a problem or he'd have tried to fix it.

312
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:32,199
They'll figure it out
when they try to switch him back.

313
00:25:32,287 --> 00:25:33,720
If they try to switch.

314
00:25:33,807 --> 00:25:38,119
If we don't track down the duplicate,
we may not get the real O'Neill back?

315
00:25:38,207 --> 00:25:43,565
We're sure the Asgard could find him
if he wants. That's not the real issue.

316
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:45,797
We wish to apprehend the Asgard.

317
00:25:45,887 --> 00:25:49,197
Intercepting the next switch
may be our only shot.

318
00:25:51,407 --> 00:25:53,602
- Hammond.
- General Hammond, sir.

319
00:25:53,687 --> 00:25:58,556
I have a Lieutenant Colonel Beck from
the 10th Air Base Wing on the line for you.

320
00:25:58,647 --> 00:26:01,525
- It has to do with Colonel O'Neill.
- Patch him through.

321
00:26:01,607 --> 00:26:03,484
Yes, sir.

322
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:20,126
Unless you brought beer,
that's close enough.

323
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:25,197
Colonel, we need you
to come back with us.

324
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:26,845
How'd you find me?

325
00:26:26,927 --> 00:26:31,523
Lieutenant Colonel Beck called General
Hammond and placed you in the area.

326
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:34,440
A man from whom you bought bait
recommended this river.

327
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:38,202
Tell Jacob thanks, but I'm
not interested in the deep-freeze deal.

328
00:26:38,287 --> 00:26:41,518
We're not here to take you to the Tok'ra.
There may not be much time.

329
00:26:41,607 --> 00:26:44,644
- Never is, is there?
- OK. Well...

330
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,605
There's no easy way to tell you this, so...

331
00:26:48,687 --> 00:26:52,600
Sam's just gonna
come right out and say it.

332
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:56,726
Well, sir, as you know, the Asgard
depend on a cloning technology...

333
00:26:56,807 --> 00:26:58,604
Oh, for cryin' out loud!

334
00:27:00,087 --> 00:27:02,920
You have been cloned, O'Neill.

335
00:27:03,007 --> 00:27:03,996
What?

336
00:27:04,087 --> 00:27:09,366
We think the Asgard took the real you
and made a copy - an unstable one at that.

337
00:27:10,487 --> 00:27:12,717
The "real" me?

338
00:27:13,727 --> 00:27:19,438
Yeah, the original. That's not
your "real" anything. I'm sorry.

339
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:26,161
Where's the original?

340
00:27:26,247 --> 00:27:30,286
That's what we hope to find out.
But we need your help.

341
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:40,480
We've calculated a seven-day gap
between abductions,

342
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,637
which puts us at tonight.

343
00:27:42,727 --> 00:27:45,366
This plan sucks.

344
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:51,516
Look, I know you don't think
I am who I am,

345
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:54,758
but as far as I'm concerned, I am...

346
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:58,283
who I am.

347
00:27:59,207 --> 00:28:02,597
The switch is our only chance
of capturing whoever's behind this.

348
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:05,520
What about the fact
that this body is dying?

349
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:09,998
Has anyone even thought
about that for a second?

350
00:28:12,007 --> 00:28:14,760
Oh. I see.

351
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:19,999
You don't care, as long as
you get the original back.

352
00:28:21,607 --> 00:28:24,519
We just... We don't know
what else to do for you.

353
00:28:24,607 --> 00:28:27,440
Perhaps the Asgard responsible
can correct his mistake.

354
00:28:27,527 --> 00:28:30,200
Fine. Give me a nine-mil.
I'll get it out of the sucker.

355
00:28:30,287 --> 00:28:32,676
We don't know who or what
we might be facing yet.

356
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:38,000
Exactly why you can't just
use me as bait and hang me out to dry.

357
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:41,562
You'll never intercept an Asgard beam.

358
00:28:41,647 --> 00:28:46,482
The only chance you have
of capturing this guy is me.

359
00:28:49,247 --> 00:28:51,602
Come on.

360
00:28:55,047 --> 00:28:57,083
A zat gun.

361
00:28:58,087 --> 00:28:59,998
Thank you, sir.

362
00:29:09,807 --> 00:29:12,241
Carter, you still got your ears on?

363
00:29:12,327 --> 00:29:15,239
- Yes, sir.
- Daniel? Teal'c?

364
00:29:16,127 --> 00:29:20,006
- Everything appears to be normal, O'Neill.
- Yeah? Not to me.

365
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:21,964
Wanna go over the instructions again?

366
00:29:22,047 --> 00:29:26,006
Don't worry, Carter.
I'm sure I'll figure it out.

367
00:29:39,087 --> 00:29:41,237
Colonel, you all right?

368
00:29:41,327 --> 00:29:44,364
Jack! Jack!

369
00:29:44,927 --> 00:29:46,918
O'Neill.

370
00:29:56,607 --> 00:29:59,599
What are you all doing in my bedroom?

371
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:12,399
Hello. Do not be afraid.

372
00:30:30,847 --> 00:30:34,681
- I assume this is important.
- Just a little, sir.

373
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:48,000
OK.

374
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:51,202
Wrong console.

375
00:30:54,567 --> 00:30:58,560
Far right jewel thingy... up.

376
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:02,966
Ah! And three o'clock.

377
00:31:03,047 --> 00:31:05,720
I was having the weirdest dream.

378
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:13,364
You see, Carter?
Told you it was no problem.

379
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:25,196
What's goin' on?

380
00:31:26,527 --> 00:31:31,521
Wow. You know, I'm really
much taller than I think.

381
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:36,122
Carter?

382
00:31:36,967 --> 00:31:40,846
Colonel O'Neill, meet... Colonel O'Neill.

383
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:49,838
- What's goin' on?
- We're pretty sure this Asgard over here

384
00:31:49,927 --> 00:31:53,806
kidnapped you and attempted
to replace you with a clone.

385
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:56,082
How long was I asleep?

386
00:31:56,167 --> 00:31:59,477
- Seven days.
- It's a record.

387
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,080
So you're...

388
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:02,202
- You.
...me?

389
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:08,556
Yeah. Believe me, if you think it's weird,
imagine how I feel being the copy.

390
00:32:11,927 --> 00:32:14,316
He has awakened.

391
00:32:21,727 --> 00:32:25,242
- What's happening?
- We were kinda hoping you could tell us.

392
00:32:25,327 --> 00:32:28,876
- No, no, no. This is all wrong.
- Hey!

393
00:32:30,407 --> 00:32:32,523
I'll tell you what's wrong.

394
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:37,078
I just woke up, I haven't had coffee,
let alone a pee in seven days,

395
00:32:37,167 --> 00:32:42,321
and I find out you stole my ass
and made a... mini-me.

396
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,556
Carter, I should be irked currently, yes?

397
00:32:51,367 --> 00:32:53,562
Yes, I would be.

398
00:32:56,447 --> 00:33:00,156
- Why don't you tell us who you are?
- Loki.

399
00:33:00,927 --> 00:33:04,681
According to Norse mythology,
that's the god of mischief.

400
00:33:04,767 --> 00:33:08,919
- What did you want with Colonel O'Neill?
- I have nothing more to say to any of you.

401
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:13,125
Hey! We just saved your flat little
white asses from the replicators.

402
00:33:13,207 --> 00:33:16,802
- This is the thanks we get?
- At least you're gonna live.

403
00:33:17,807 --> 00:33:19,365
What?

404
00:33:19,447 --> 00:33:25,682
Maybe you're a little put out. But this guy
didn't hit the right buttons on the Xerox.

405
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:30,839
This body is gonna fall apart
if he doesn't fix me.

406
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:34,920
I cannot. All the clones
suffer the same fate.

407
00:33:35,967 --> 00:33:39,118
OK. I'm going back
to my original question.

408
00:33:39,207 --> 00:33:41,675
What's going on?

409
00:33:41,767 --> 00:33:46,283
I am a scientist, a former geneticist
with the Asgard Ruling Council.

410
00:33:46,367 --> 00:33:48,517
- Former?
- I was stripped of my stature

411
00:33:48,607 --> 00:33:52,361
after I was caught performing
unsanctioned experiments on humans.

412
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,961
What, you've got sanctioned ones?

413
00:33:55,047 --> 00:33:59,837
I had the courage to do what was needed
to advance our cloning technology.

414
00:33:59,927 --> 00:34:03,636
Instead of courage,
some might call it a lack of morality.

415
00:34:03,727 --> 00:34:07,436
Our population cannot withstand
the duplication process for much longer.

416
00:34:07,527 --> 00:34:10,087
How can experimenting on humans
change that?

417
00:34:10,167 --> 00:34:14,797
Your bodies are similar to
our original form thousands of years ago.

418
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,321
Using your physical make-up
as a template,

419
00:34:17,407 --> 00:34:23,482
I hoped to construct a clone that could
contain our massively superior intellect.

420
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:27,879
- My research was unsuccessful.
- So much for massively superior intellect.

421
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:31,004
- I was gonna say that.
- I was going to say

422
00:34:31,087 --> 00:34:34,682
it was unsuccessful prior to
my being caught and banished.

423
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:41,081
- I would have found what I needed.
- Why risk coming back after 19 years?

424
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:44,682
Because I thought he was the one.

425
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,797
- Me?
- Me?

426
00:34:47,887 --> 00:34:51,197
I believed his genetic code
contained the key.

427
00:34:51,287 --> 00:34:52,322
- Mine?
- Mine?

428
00:34:52,407 --> 00:34:53,886
Stop it.

429
00:34:53,967 --> 00:34:57,926
He was physiologically advanced enough
to carry and utilise all the data

430
00:34:58,007 --> 00:35:00,680
from the Ancients'
repository of knowledge -

431
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:03,804
impossible for any human
one generation ago.

432
00:35:03,887 --> 00:35:07,038
He is a significant step forward
on your evolutionary path.

433
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:12,121
- You just found this out recently?
- I learned it when all the Asgard did.

434
00:35:12,207 --> 00:35:14,198
O'Neill is legendary.

435
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:18,280
The Asgard fleet has been distracted
by the war with the replicators

436
00:35:18,367 --> 00:35:21,086
and subsequent relocation of our people.

437
00:35:21,967 --> 00:35:25,482
So you took the opportunity when
no one was looking to sneak back here.

438
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:30,163
I do not regret my actions.
I am trying to save my people.

439
00:35:30,847 --> 00:35:33,919
Look, I know this isn't all about me,
but come on.

440
00:35:34,007 --> 00:35:38,478
- Seriously, I'm dyin' here.
- I cannot reverse your fate.

441
00:35:38,567 --> 00:35:43,402
Nor can I explain why you did not mature
to the proper age as you should have.

442
00:35:43,487 --> 00:35:47,036
Well, easy to see why
they kicked you out of the science club.

443
00:35:47,127 --> 00:35:50,005
All right, I've heard enough.

444
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:53,280
Carter!

445
00:35:55,087 --> 00:35:57,840
Can you call Thor on this thing?

446
00:35:58,607 --> 00:36:03,317
- Please, do not.
- We've tried contacting the Asgard.

447
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:07,680
- You'd think if Thor knew about this...
- OK, pretty sure that's it.

448
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:23,317
All right, how long are we going...

449
00:36:23,407 --> 00:36:25,967
You all right?

450
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:29,958
Actually, no.

451
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:33,278
What do we do if Thor doesn't show up?

452
00:36:35,847 --> 00:36:37,200
Never mind.

453
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:40,040
Well, it's about time.

454
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:43,005
I apologise for not coming sooner.

455
00:36:44,247 --> 00:36:46,158
Loki, what have you done?

456
00:36:46,247 --> 00:36:50,206
Seems he's been playing Dr Moreau
behind your back.

457
00:36:50,287 --> 00:36:52,278
Yes. Dr Moreau.

458
00:36:52,367 --> 00:36:54,881
- You know why I am here.
- You should have known

459
00:36:54,967 --> 00:36:58,437
O'Neill's genetic coding
was safeguarded for his own protection.

460
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:00,279
Excuse me?

461
00:37:00,367 --> 00:37:06,522
A marker was placed in your DNA to
prevent attempts at genetic manipulation.

462
00:37:06,607 --> 00:37:10,122
- The abnormality.
- That's why the clone didn't mature.

463
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:13,836
Yes. Loki will be punished for his actions.

464
00:37:13,927 --> 00:37:18,045
Is it true that Colonel O'Neill is the key
to solving your cloning problems?

465
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:19,799
No.

466
00:37:19,887 --> 00:37:23,323
- But I thought I was advanced.
- Indeed you are, O'Neill.

467
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,126
But our scientists
have already determined

468
00:37:26,207 --> 00:37:29,677
that while you are an important step
forward in the evolutionary chain,

469
00:37:29,767 --> 00:37:33,840
the missing link we have been
searching for still eludes us.

470
00:37:33,927 --> 00:37:34,996
I'm sorry.

471
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:39,524
Again, I apologise for any inconvenience
Loki may have caused.

472
00:37:39,607 --> 00:37:41,916
Yeah, that's what I'd call it.

473
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:47,479
Unfortunately, the eventual genetic
breakdown of the clone is not my doing,

474
00:37:47,567 --> 00:37:50,286
but rather a result of Loki's inept methods.

475
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:54,883
There was no need
for the clones to survive.

476
00:38:01,927 --> 00:38:03,918
Look, Thor.

477
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:09,081
Is there anything you can do for him?
The whining's starting to grate.

478
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:12,921
- You wish your clone to live?
- You can't just let me die.

479
00:38:17,767 --> 00:38:21,442
- He's just a kid.
- Are you certain, O'Neill?

480
00:38:25,327 --> 00:38:27,318
I'm thinking.

481
00:38:30,287 --> 00:38:32,243
- Yeah.
- Very well.

482
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,804
I will attempt to repair his DNA.

483
00:38:35,887 --> 00:38:41,484
If successful, he should continue
to mature at a normal human rate.

484
00:38:49,567 --> 00:38:51,558
Thanks.

485
00:38:58,927 --> 00:39:01,361
# Today

486
00:39:01,447 --> 00:39:03,756
# On the street

487
00:39:03,847 --> 00:39:06,077
# In the metro

488
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:08,442
# It's a melancholy day

489
00:39:08,527 --> 00:39:10,916
# No one speaks

490
00:39:11,007 --> 00:39:13,475
# Passing you by

491
00:39:13,567 --> 00:39:15,558
# Wondering why

492
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:24,197
You sure about this?

493
00:39:25,207 --> 00:39:28,199
I've thought a lot about it.

494
00:39:28,287 --> 00:39:34,965
You know, you... me. I mean,
we never really did embrace high school.

495
00:39:38,567 --> 00:39:42,276
Haven't you ever wanted to go back
and do it all over again,

496
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:45,165
especially with all you know now?

497
00:39:48,127 --> 00:39:50,118
No.

498
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:54,960
Well, from here on in
you and me are different.

499
00:39:55,047 --> 00:39:57,515
Which is why I'm gonna do this.

500
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:04,645
Hey, listen. Do me a favour, huh?

501
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:08,364
Don't worry, I wasn't gonna keep in touch.

502
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:11,439
- Yeah, it'd just be a little...
- Weird.

503
00:40:11,527 --> 00:40:13,518
Weird, yeah.

504
00:40:13,607 --> 00:40:14,801
Yeah.

505
00:40:15,687 --> 00:40:18,042
But if you need anything, just...

506
00:40:18,127 --> 00:40:21,836
The air force has set me up. I'll be fine.

507
00:40:22,247 --> 00:40:25,796
You sure about this?
I mean, it's high school.

508
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:35,882
Yes. Go forth, young man.

509
00:40:39,967 --> 00:40:44,006
# Who am I?

510
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:49,159
# Who am I?

511
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:54,158
# Who am I?

512
00:41:01,487 --> 00:41:03,921
# Today

513
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:06,282
# In the air

514
00:41:06,367 --> 00:41:08,597
# On the metro

515
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:14,364
# It's a melancholy day
