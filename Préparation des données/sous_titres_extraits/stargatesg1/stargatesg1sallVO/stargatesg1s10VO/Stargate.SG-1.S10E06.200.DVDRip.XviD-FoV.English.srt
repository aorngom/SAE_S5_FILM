is that you were bombarded by

172
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,584
You don't want your heroes to
become too powerful.

173
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,922
Well, you could always invent
some negative side-effects.

174
00:10:29,829 --> 00:10:32,889
That's how we talked Colonel O'Neill
into becoming visible again.

175
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:36,127
Okay, that's it, SG-1,
you are cleared to leave.

176
00:10:36,235 --> 00:10:37,668
- Thank you.
- MARTIN: They can't leave!

177
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,533
They haven't finished reading my script!

178
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,199
That's funny, I thought it said
"General" on my uniform.

179
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,072
- We owe you one, sir.
- You mean another one.

180
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,702
What are you talking about?
I thought you said it was going to be fun.

181
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,940
Not after his zombie idea got shot down.

182
00:10:50,049 --> 00:10:52,415
So, where are you guys all off to?

183
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:55,078
Someplace pretty important, huh?

184
00:10:55,187 --> 00:10:56,711
It's just a recon mission, isn't it?

185
00:10:57,056 --> 00:10:59,524
"Just" a recon mission?
This is no simple recon mission.

186
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,150
This is no less than my 200th trip
through the gate.

187
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,228
Really?

188
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:04,688
- You're counting?
- You bet.

189
00:11:04,797 --> 00:11:07,459
TEAL'C: I have been reflecting
while changing into our gear.

190
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:11,002
I believe this is far from
your 200th mission, Colonel Mitchell.

191
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,664
I didn't say 200th mission.
I said 200th trip through the gate.

192
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:17,641
That's counting off-world gates,
back and forth, pretty much anytime

193
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,677
I crossed the event horizon.

194
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,748
Yeah. This is going to be huge.

195
00:11:22,882 --> 00:11:24,975
The big 200.

196
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:32,782
(INAUDIBLE)

197
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,696
- Fix it.
- Quickly.

198
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,859
- I'm on it.
- Indeed.

199
00:11:47,239 --> 00:11:48,263
Gotta go!

200
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:51,468
We've got 10 seconds before
the time dilation field is activated.

201
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,775
If we don't make it through the gate,
we'll be stuck here forever!

202
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,615
Okay, this could be a problem.

203
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,882
- That was close, huh?
- Oh, yeah.

204
00:12:05,257 --> 00:12:07,282
JACKSON: Are you serious?
MARTIN: What?

205
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,860
How did we escape?

206
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:11,463
- They.
- Fine, they, they, they.

207
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,432
- How did they escape?
- Isn't it obvious?

208
00:12:15,534 --> 00:12:19,163
Even if the valley wasn't filled with Jaffa,
we could never have made it

209
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:22,206
to the gate and dialed out
in under 10 seconds.

210
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,839
Good. See, that's why we're here.

211
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,412
So, what do you think? 30 seconds?

212
00:12:27,513 --> 00:12:29,777
Maybe not such a round number.

213
00:12:30,116 --> 00:12:32,311
How about 38?

214
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:33,612
What difference does it make?

215
00:12:33,719 --> 00:12:36,779
I mean, it's not like you're going to have
an actual ticking clock on the screen.

216
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:39,756
- That's brilliant!
- That's ridiculous.

217
00:12:39,859 --> 00:12:43,693
Trust me, jeopardy plus ticking clock
is box office.

218
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:46,492
It's the E=MC-squared
of the entertainment world.

219
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,930
Ask any executive.

220
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,692
Except I think you've replaced jeopardy
with certain death.

221
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:56,374
Oh, come on. You guys have escaped
situations more dire than this before.

222
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,735
- He has a point.
- So show the actual escape.

223
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:03,547
No, no, no.
You can't give away too much, too early.

224
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:04,843
It'll step on the ending.

225
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,351
Maybe if my character doesn't say,
"This is a problem."

226
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:11,014
He could say something like,
"This should be easy."

227
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:14,682
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's not you.

228
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,057
Colonel Danning
is based on Colonel O'Neill.

229
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:24,367
Please tell me
you have the gate working again.

230
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:27,098
We're running another diagnostic,
but right now, we're stumped.

231
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,003
The power's getting through
to the capacitors,

232
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:31,338
but, for some reason,
the charge isn't holding.

233
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:34,310
That's causing the control crystal to
send feedback into the interface

234
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:38,144
and reset the programming code
of the base computer's dialing protocol.

235
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,447
Whoa! That was awesome. Say that again.

236
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,285
No.

237
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:50,026
Oh. Everybody, take five.
I've got to get that down before I forget it.

238
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,495
MARTIN: The power getting
to the flux capacitor,

239
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:56,090
but feedback is not feeding back
into the feedback face.

240
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:57,635
This is gold!

241
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,065
Forget about the techno talk.
No one's really interested in it.

242
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,170
You're an alien, right?

243
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,871
Exactly, and I know
just what this movie needs.

244
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,383
So how would you know what sci-fi fans
from Earth would be interested in?

245
00:14:13,252 --> 00:14:17,348
- Aren't you also an alien?
- Yeah, but I've been here quite a while.

246
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,159
Right. Look, I think I know a good story
when I hear one.

247
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,854
Don't you want this movie to appeal
to a broad range of people?

248
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,563
- From Earth.
- I have all kinds of fabulous adventures,

249
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:30,931
none of which have been classified
by the Air Force.

250
00:14:32,471 --> 00:14:35,304
- Okay, shoot. Give me your best one.
- Right.

251
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:38,171
I was in a stolen cargo ship,
on my way home,

252
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:42,371
<i>when a solar flare from a nearby star</i>
<i>wreaked havoc with my navigation system</i>

253
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:44,949
and I was forced to crash-land
on the nearest planet.

254
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,449
In a bizarre twist of fate,

255
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,715
<i>I crashed right on top of the Goa 'uld</i>
<i>who ruled that planet,</i>

256
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,688
<i>which was fortunate because</i>
<i>my ship was too badly damaged to repair</i>

257
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:54,418
<i>and I needed help.</i>

258
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,656
<i>The local villagers were very grateful.</i>

259
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,863
<i>They introduced me</i>
<i>to a lovely fair-haired Tok'ra</i>

260
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:03,730
<i>who had been hiding out on the planet.</i>

261
00:15:03,836 --> 00:15:06,498
<i>She told me the legend</i>
<i>of a powerful Ascended being</i>

262
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:09,836
<i>who supposedly lived in some distant,</i>
<i>far-off mountains</i>

263
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,273
<i>through a treacherous forest.</i>

264
00:15:11,377 --> 00:15:13,436
Look, I don't have all day.
Cut to the chase.

265
00:15:13,545 --> 00:15:16,070
All right. I met up with a number
of my friends along the way,

266
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,809
and after a dangerous
and eventful journey,

267
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,251
we finally come face to face
with the Ascended being.

268
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:24,885
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

269
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,652
Well, at first I thought
I just wanted to go home,

270
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,560
but now I've decided
I'd quite like to be a part of something.

271
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:34,258
A regular part, if you catch my drift.

272
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:38,561
Oh, and these guys have
their own issues. Boys?

273
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:51,907
That's <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>

274
00:15:53,485 --> 00:15:57,046
- Oh, you've seen that one?
- Yeah.

275
00:15:58,023 --> 00:16:01,049
Oh, that's my phone. Martin Lloyd.

276
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,288
- I didn't hear it ring.
- It's on vibrate.

277
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,359
MARTIN: Yes, go ahead.

278
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:07,800
I can sing.

279
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:13,764
- So how's it going?
- Not well.

280
00:16:14,373 --> 00:16:16,307
Samantha, 200 is waiting.

281
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:17,466
Right now, I'm just hoping

282
00:16:17,576 --> 00:16:19,942
we haven't done something
to permanently damage the gate.

283
00:16:20,045 --> 00:16:22,639
How can something work perfectly fine
for 10 years

284
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:24,272
then all of a sudden
it doesn't work anymore?

285
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,681
I don't know. Okay, try it now.

286
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:33,681
We're getting some strange
power readings here, Colonel.

287
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,690
- Shut it down.
- It's not responding.

288
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:40,731
The gate's drawing massive amounts
of energy into its capacitors.

289
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,233
Close the blast door and the iris.

290
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,012
I can't shut it down.

291
00:16:54,113 --> 00:16:56,308
Siler, manually cut the power!

292
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,280
(SCREAMING)

293
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:09,726
Why does this always happen to me?

294
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:13,254
Sir, we have to evacuate the base!

295
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:17,060
This is General Landry.
I'm declaring a code red emergency.

296
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,262
All personnel,
evacuate the base immediately.

297
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,338
(ALARM BLARING)

298
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:23,465
Sir, the capacitors are overloading.
We have to get out of here now.

299
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,872
Hurry.

300
00:17:31,316 --> 00:17:34,285
And that is the end of act two.

301
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,181
- The mountain blows up?
- No possible hope for survival.

302
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,658
Cool, huh? I just wrote it
based on what's going on with the gate.

303
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,363
I love it when art imitates life.

304
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,562
Hang on. We're alive in the next scene.

305
00:17:51,136 --> 00:17:53,434
Oh, I just haven't fixed that part yet.

306
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:58,203
I'm thinking I can back-sell it and say
you were beamed out at the last second.

307
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,574
- JACKSON: Beamed out?
- Sure. Why not?

308
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:04,171
- Is that not too convenient?
- MARTIN: Not if you hang a lantern on it.

309
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,376
- What's that?
- It's a writer's term.

310
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,976
Another character points out
how convenient it is.

311
00:18:10,656 --> 00:18:14,649
Dr. Levant can say,
"Well, that was great timing."

312
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:19,421
That way the audience knows
I intended for it to be convenient,

313
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:22,125
- and we move on.
- Really.

314
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,994
- Okay, where were we?
- Scene 24.

315
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,696
Oh, great, one of my favorite scenes.

316
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,334
Go ahead.

317

<i>VALA: "The crew mans their stations."</i>

320
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,981
I'm picking up
a strange energy anomaly, Colonel.

321
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:43,077
It appears the singularity
is about to explode.

322
00:18:43,188 --> 00:18:44,519
Weapons are at maximum.

323
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,624
Damn it, Captain! Solar flare.

324
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,659
We've got a shockwave
heading straight for us.

325
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,251
Can you reverse the polarity?

326
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,288
I'll do my best.

329

I'm giving it all I've got, Captain,
but you're expecting a bloody miracle.

330
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,375
- JACKSON: Hang on, hang on, hang on.
- What?

331
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,809
Okay, one, that's <i>Star Trek.</i>
And two, it's ridiculous.

332
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:12,747
What's wrong with it?

333
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:15,786
- The singularity is about to explode?
- Yes.

334
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,614
Everything about that statement is wrong.

00:19:18,724 --> 00:19:22,023
How exactly is having weapons
at maximum going to help the situation?

336
00:19:22,127 --> 00:19:24,527
The audience isn't going to
know the difference.

337
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,531
They love weapons at maximum.

338
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:29,958
Never underestimate your audience.

why everything in this script

how things really work out there
in the galaxy,

345
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:48,378
but I know the film business.
Explosions make great trailers.

346
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:51,223
Simple fact.
More explosions, better trailer.

347
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:52,349
Simple fact.
More explosions, better trailer.

348

I already put in a call to his manager.

We'll get back to you. Yeah. Bye.

357
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:31,251
one of the new junior executives
at the network has suggested

358
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:35,800
we re-cast the whole movie
with younger, edgier versions of the team.

359
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,764

Yo, dawg, what did you do that for?

was so totally a Goa'uld!

- What happens at the end of act three?
- With these cuts, not much.

No, it's 63. Pretty sure.
I've read all the files recently.

- Can you tell me?
- Oh, yeah, we can tell you.

421

MITCHELL: Carter, correct me if I'm wrong
on this, but is it not

445
00:25:01,867 --> 00:25:04,961
a fact of parallel dimension physics
that each of us exists

446
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,233
somewhere in some universe in whatever
way, shape, or form we can imagine?

447
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,707
Any way, shape, or form we can imagine.
We've seen it for ourselves.

00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,276
There you go.

449
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:15,839
Use your imagination.

450
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,254
All right, people.

451
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:31,659
We created this multi-billion dollar
facility under Cheyenne Mountain

452
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,958
so that we can use this thing.

453
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,958
Anyone know how?

454
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,771
Sir, we thought you knew.

455
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:49,438
I do know this, we need to put
together a team,

456
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:53,848
starting with the most beautiful,
battle-ready scientific genius I know,

457
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:58,385
- Captain Doctor Samantha Carter.
- Reporting for duty, sir.

458
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,787
What can you tell us, Captain?

459
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,694
Well, at first glance, I suspect the device
creates a stable wormhole

460
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:08,664
between superconducting rings that
have been placed in fixed positions

461
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:09,756
elsewhere in the galaxy...

462
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:11,426
...converts matter into energy
at the event horizon,

463
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,697
once the initial vortex has subsided,
of course.

464
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,638
And just because my sex organs
are on the inside instead of the outside

465
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:17,901
doesn't mean that I can't handle...

466
00:26:18,009 --> 00:26:20,807
Provided, of course, that sufficient energy
has been channeled to the device

467
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,779
and that the correct coordinates
have been calculated.

468
00:26:25,116 --> 00:26:26,811
Okay, get to it.

469
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:31,678
Next, we need a bookworm adventurer
who can say "brains" and "guts"

470
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,485
in 27 languages.

471
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,116
Dr. Daniel Jackson.

472
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:38,093
Why have I been brought here?
This is not...

473
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,232
What is that?

474
00:26:41,499 --> 00:26:43,160
The reason you're here, Doctor.

475
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:47,864
This big ring was discovered
in the sands of Egypt, near Giza.

476
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,200
Then I was right.

477
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,205
The pyramids really were landing sites
for interplanetary starships that

478
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:58,271
enslaved primitive human populations
by posing as their gods.

479
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,975
Well, we found the ring in the sand.

480
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,179
These symbols, they look familiar.

481
00:27:04,389 --> 00:27:07,552
They're like constellations.
Don't you see? Here.

482
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,087
If each symbol represents
a specific point in space,

483
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:17,498
then six of them
would create a sort of box.

484
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:21,333
The intersection point between those
six points would indicate a destination.

485
00:27:21,439 --> 00:27:26,604
Maybe, just maybe,
the seventh marks the starting point.

486
00:27:26,878 --> 00:27:29,438
Is there a monitor that shows
these symbols in detail?

487
00:27:29,547 --> 00:27:31,412
Over here, Dr. Jackson.

488
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,750
Wait.

489
00:27:39,858 --> 00:27:41,917
This one seems different.

490
00:27:42,027 --> 00:27:43,756
You found the ring in Egypt.

491
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,352
The pyramid represents Earth.

492
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,556
This symbol has to be the point of origin.

493
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,260
It was under our noses the whole time.

494
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,226
I feel so stupid.

495
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:57,775
And now what this team needs is a leader,
someone who'll laugh in the face

496
00:27:57,876 --> 00:28:00,868
of his enemy,
even when it's inappropriate.

497
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:03,780
Colonel Jack O'Neill.

498
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:05,782
I thought I told you I retired.

499
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:10,086
I thought you said you were tired.

500
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:14,524
Well, as a matter of fact, I am a little tired.

501
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,651
There's no time for that now.

502
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,820
You have a mission to lead.

503
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:19,919
Right!

504

00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:12,376
"It's what I do."

680
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,978
"It's what I do."

681
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:21,719
That was so, you know, good.

682
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,619
It defined Colonel Danning.

683
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:28,123
I just don't think they know
what they want to do with my character.

684
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:32,760
I probably should have taken up golf
a long time ago.

685
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:35,730
Just... Just kidding.

686
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:38,335
And I needed something even better

687
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:43,436
to make you forget about the guy
that fans loved to watch

688
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,015
for the first seven years of the show.

689
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:47,982
I know he was here for eight,

690
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:51,316
but, you know, a lot of people say
he just kind of phoned it in

691
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,083
that last season.

692
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,921
Yeah, well, that's ancient history.
We don't talk about that around here.

693
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,492
The fact of the matter is, I don't
really even know what happened there.

694
00:40:00,598 --> 00:40:03,294
You know, to me, it never felt like
I was leaving the show.

695
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,198
I just needed a little space,
a little time, you know?

696
00:40:05,302 --> 00:40:07,236
I wanted to get back to my roots.
Theater, right?

697
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,863
So I go to New York, do a little Broadway,

698
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,441
off-off-Broadway.
Either way, it doesn't matter.

699
00:40:11,542 --> 00:40:14,670
Acting, you know?
Acting without having people hurling

700
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:17,907
papier-mch boulders at you all (BLEEP)
Day. It was great, you know?

701
00:40:18,015 --> 00:40:20,176
I like them both. I like boulders.
I'm fine with that.

702
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,481
This production runs
like a well-oiled machine,

703
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:26,784
and, sure, that starts from the top,
but, I mean,

704
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:29,052
we all love the show.

705
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:34,227
The gaffers, the lighting guy, the medic,

706
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:37,095
the makeup and the caterers.

707
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,293
It's like a family.

708
00:40:38,402 --> 00:40:41,838
The writers were trying to come up
with a catch phrase.

709
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:47,333
"I can get behind that,"
was something we tried for a while.

710
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:52,038
Anyway, I mean, I'd actually like
to do some writing.

711
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,708
Maybe have a baby.

712
00:40:53,818 --> 00:40:54,785
(EX CLAIMS)

713
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:56,648
It just hit me.

714
00:40:58,155 --> 00:40:59,554
Sweet...

715
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:00,624
(BLEEPING)

716
00:41:04,495 --> 00:41:07,726
And we can get away with that,
too, because it's cable.

717
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,932
You can't get there without the fans,
right? I have to thank them.

718
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,467
I've got to thank specifically the ones...

719
00:41:13,571 --> 00:41:16,938
Oh, God, what's it called?
SaveDrLevant. Com.

720
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,702
Have you seen the site?
I mean, it's insane.

721
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:22,370
Apparently they get dozens of hits
a month, whatever. I think that's a lot.

722
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:26,745
But between them and the ad in <i>Variety</i>
that they put out, I'm pretty sure

723
00:41:26,851 --> 00:41:29,820
that went a long way towards convincing
the producers to take me back.

724
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,581
Have me... To invite me back.

725
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:34,681
It wasn't their decision, you know.
They called, said, "Hey, do you want it?"

726
00:41:34,792 --> 00:41:36,054
You know, and I was ready.

727
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,618
What I think really makes this show
what it is,

728
00:41:40,397 --> 00:41:45,425
is the chemistry with the cast.

729
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:46,503
(MUSICAL CELL PHONE RINGING)

730
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,162
Yeah. Oh, could you hold on?

731
00:41:48,272 --> 00:41:49,933
Stop the tape.

732
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,008
Who does he think he is?

733
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:57,274
Well, you tell that ungrateful little (BLEEP)
Bag to shove it up his (BLEEP)

734
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:01,416
Yeah, yeah, let him try to get a job
that pays this much.

735
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,420
You weren't rolling, were... Okay.

736
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,583
What... What was I saying?

737
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:13,424
Oh, yes, the cast.

738
00:42:15,065 --> 00:42:16,225
Holy...

739
00:42:16,333 --> 00:42:17,857
(BLEEPING)

740
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:24,706
That would be, like, a 19.

741
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:26,969
That's it? You're good? All right.

742
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:29,610
Can I get my (BLEEP) sandwich, please?

743
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,012
All right. Hey, thanks, man.

744
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,046
Science fiction is an existential metaphor

745
00:42:35,152 --> 00:42:38,588
that allows us to tell stories
about the human condition.

746
00:42:38,789 --> 00:42:42,350
Isaac Asimov once said, "Individual
science fiction stories may seem

747
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:46,691
"as trivial as ever to the blinder critics
and philosophers of today,

748
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:50,392
"but the core of science fiction,
its essence, has become crucial

749
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:53,368
"to our salvation,
if we are to be saved at all."
