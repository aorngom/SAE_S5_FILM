<i>Previously</i>

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,209
<i>on Stargate SG-1...</i>

3
00:00:03,219 --> 00:00:04,262
<i>Welcome</i>

4
00:00:04,554 --> 00:00:06,514
<i>you knights of the round table.</i>

5
00:00:06,539 --> 00:00:07,832
<i>Prove ye worthy...</i>

6
00:00:08,525 --> 00:00:11,444
<i>and all shall be revealed.</i>

7
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:12,929
<i>So you're in the Ori galaxy?</i>

8
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:13,780
<i>Yes.</i>

9
00:00:13,863 --> 00:00:17,349
<i>Me carrying this child right now
is a problem, a big problem, but</i>

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,127
<i>believe me, there is one which is much, much bigger.</i>

11
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:21,553
<i>The ships are planning to leave.</i>

12
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,081
Somewhere out there,
the Ori have a working Supergate.

13
00:00:24,091 --> 00:00:26,552
Merlin was conducting research
on some kind of new invention...

14
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:29,430
<i>A weapon capable of destroying ascended beings.</i>

15
00:00:29,496 --> 00:00:31,415
I don't need to know Ancient
to understand what that is.

16
00:00:31,582 --> 00:00:33,374
A Gate address to where he hid the weapon.

17
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:37,096
Every ally we have and everyone else on this base has
already devoted themselves to finding the Supergate.

18
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:38,164
Go.

19
00:00:40,925 --> 00:00:45,138
Hey, has anyone stopped to think
how this thing might possibly work?

20
00:00:45,605 --> 00:00:46,913
I mean, how do you...

21
00:00:46,923 --> 00:00:48,314
kill something that's pure energy?

22
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:50,618
Well, technically,
Merlin's research didn't refer to "killing".

23
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:54,564
A better translation would be
"neutralizing" or "canceling out".

24
00:00:55,006 --> 00:00:57,425
Well, that still begs a lot of questions.

25
00:00:57,592 --> 00:00:59,511
How do you aim at something you can't see?

26
00:00:59,553 --> 00:01:01,954
Clearly can't be a weapon in the conventional sense.

27
00:01:01,964 --> 00:01:05,107
See, ascended beings transcend
ordinary space-time as we know it.

28
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:07,202
This device would have to do the same thing.

29
00:01:08,145 --> 00:01:11,690
- In other words, you have no idea what it might be.
- Yeah, pretty much, that's it.

30
00:01:13,025 --> 00:01:14,777
This looks promising...

31
00:01:39,845 --> 00:01:42,890
Well, it certainly looks like a place
where Merlin might have lived.

32
00:01:43,582 --> 00:01:47,503
Well, I wouldn't get too excited just yet.
There could be dozens of villages in the area...

33
00:01:48,137 --> 00:01:49,388
just like this one.

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,431
No way to know for sure this is the right one.

35
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:53,567
Well, there's...

36
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:54,443
that.

37
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:10,135
Travelers.

38
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:13,997
I am...

39
00:02:14,389 --> 00:02:17,267
Meurik, Governor of this village.

40
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,696
Welcome to Camelot.

41
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:29,274
Season 9 - Episode 20
Camelot

42
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:29,232
These must be the strangers
that everyone is speaking of.

43
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:33,019
This is Antonius, our village historian.

44
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:37,813
Welcome to Camelot, past and future home
of King Arthur and his round table.

45
00:03:37,933 --> 00:03:38,612
<i>Sorry?</i>

46
00:03:39,192 --> 00:03:40,270
Future home?

47
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:43,086
I assume you know the
history of the battle of Camlann...

48
00:03:43,126 --> 00:03:46,281
Of course, where Arthur was
mortally wounded by Mordred.

49
00:03:46,322 --> 00:03:47,161
Arthur?

50
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:48,839
Mortally wounded?

51
00:03:50,376 --> 00:03:51,575
Ridiculous.

52
00:03:51,794 --> 00:03:54,790
Arthur defeated Mordred at the battle of Camlann,

53
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:58,594
after which he and his fellow knights
set off to find the Sangreal.

54
00:03:58,604 --> 00:03:59,883
That's the Holy Grail.

55
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:01,461
<i>That was long ago,</i>

56
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:05,216
but we know in our hearts
that one day he will return to us.

57
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:08,292
What happened to Merlin when he left?

58
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:18,438
I have matters to attend to.
It's best I take my leave now.

59
00:04:20,196 --> 00:04:22,033
Enjoy your stay with us.

60
00:04:26,747 --> 00:04:27,745
Did I...

61
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:28,864
offend him?

62
00:04:29,543 --> 00:04:30,781
Not at all.

63
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,098
It's just that...

64
00:04:34,217 --> 00:04:37,293
Merlin's name is rarely mentioned in public.

65
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:38,611
And why is that?

66
00:04:38,891 --> 00:04:42,127
Well, many believe he was a wizard of darkness.

67
00:04:42,326 --> 00:04:44,643
He may have tried to do good, but

68
00:04:44,803 --> 00:04:47,918
there was always potential
for great mischief in his heart.

69
00:04:48,717 --> 00:04:49,797
Thankfully,

70
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:53,511
he has neither been seen
nor heard of since Arthur's departure.

71
00:04:53,551 --> 00:04:58,265
The library where he practiced
his strange arts remains sealed to this day.

72
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,891
Merlin had a library here?

73
00:05:00,901 --> 00:05:01,859
<i>Of course.</i>

74
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,356
It was his private sanctuary here in Camelot.

75
00:05:07,312 --> 00:05:08,791
We'd like to see that.

76
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,646
I'm afraid that's impossible.

77
00:05:12,106 --> 00:05:15,861
The library is protected by a powerful curse.

78
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,372
It is said that all those who enter Merlin's sanctuary
forfeit their lives to its guardian,

79
00:05:22,652 --> 00:05:24,050
the black knight.

80
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:39,949
Okay, so, best case scenario,
this "curse of the black knight" is a story
Merlin made up to scare off the locals.

81
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:45,461
Worst case scenario he's got another
holographic knight protecting his goods,
like he did back in England. Either way,

82
00:05:45,502 --> 00:05:47,139
I don't see a big problem.

83
00:05:49,536 --> 00:05:50,255
What?

84
00:05:51,613 --> 00:05:54,130
Given your narrow victory over
the knight in the Avalon cave,

85
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:57,795
it would seem that your overconfidence is ill-advised.

86
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,722
Did I say anything about me doing the fighting?

87
00:05:59,862 --> 00:06:02,858
The point is, last time was a test,
designed to measure a challenger's worth.

88
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:04,386
<i>This time it sounds more like a</i>

89
00:06:04,396 --> 00:06:08,231
defense mechanism, set up to protect Merlin's
research, which means it could be a lot tougher,

90
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,218
and the same rules might not apply.

91
00:06:10,228 --> 00:06:12,425
I think we should split up and look around.

92
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,463
<i>Indeed.</i>

93
00:06:24,568 --> 00:06:25,887
Surrender, Mordred!

94
00:06:26,026 --> 00:06:26,985
Never!

95
00:06:28,703 --> 00:06:29,502
Yield?

96
00:06:29,801 --> 00:06:30,800
<i>I yield...</i>

97
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,117
But next time, I want to be Arthur.

98
00:06:33,836 --> 00:06:37,072
I don't know if that's going to help,
if you keep moving around like Ed Grimley.

99
00:06:38,869 --> 00:06:40,507
Here. Let me show you something.

100
00:06:43,364 --> 00:06:44,362
Do you mind?

101
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:45,640
Thank you.

102
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,117
Try not to bob around quite so much.

103
00:06:54,888 --> 00:06:55,727
Nice.

104
00:07:01,978 --> 00:07:03,776
Where did you learn to fight?

105
00:07:04,195 --> 00:07:06,592
Broomstick battles with my kid brother and the

106
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:10,747
Sodan ritual of Kel Shak Lo made me the nimble warrior

107
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:12,125
that I am today.

108
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:19,365
So, do either one of you know
where we can find Merlin's...

109
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,373
Library.

110
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:21,852
Merlin's library?

111
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,469
This is it.

112
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:42,384
The door is magicked.

113
00:07:48,755 --> 00:07:50,074
<i>There is a key,</i>

114
00:07:50,713 --> 00:07:51,911
but no one dare use it.

115
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:54,238
Where would we find this key?

116
00:07:54,248 --> 00:07:56,246
It is kept in the village archives.

117
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:00,580
No.

118
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,256
Absolutely not.

119
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:04,415
Antonius...

120
00:08:05,033 --> 00:08:08,949
I will not be party to your deaths.

121
00:08:11,505 --> 00:08:14,940
Your lives would be forfeit
the instant you stepped inside.

122
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:19,114
We have faced one of Merlin's knights before.

123
00:08:19,155 --> 00:08:19,953
What?

124
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:21,272
Impossible.

125
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:24,338
If you had, you would not be here to tell the tale.

126
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:26,624
Well, I am, because we defeated him

127
00:08:26,864 --> 00:08:27,903
and in defeating him,

128
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:30,779
we acquired the treasures
he had hidden away on our world.

129
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:33,735
One of those treasures led us here, to Camelot.

130
00:08:34,134 --> 00:08:36,092
Antonius, you're the village historian.

131
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:39,028
Don't tell me you haven't dreamt
about what might be inside there.

132
00:08:47,137 --> 00:08:50,133
No one must know
of my participation in this venture.

133
00:08:50,173 --> 00:08:50,812
<i>Got it.</i>

134
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:51,851
Not Meurik,

135
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,209
not my fellow villagers,

136
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:54,847
and most importantly,

137
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:56,205
not my wife Livia,

138
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:57,204
who

139
00:08:57,563 --> 00:09:01,198
believes I am reviewing council
minutes with brother Abelard tonight.

140
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:03,196
We were never here.

141
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:33,455
Spiders.

142
00:09:56,943 --> 00:09:59,620
Yep. This could take a while.

143
00:10:07,669 --> 00:10:09,107
This is interesting.

144
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:12,402
This is a reference to Merlin's prophetic abilities.

145
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:14,400
There's a similar myth on Earth...

146
00:10:14,599 --> 00:10:17,994
<i>that Merlin could see the future because
he actually aged backwards in time.</i>

147
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,333
<i>It's not meant to be taken literally, but</i>

148
00:10:19,473 --> 00:10:23,038
we have seen that a lot of legends
and folklore have a strong basis in fact...

149
00:10:23,048 --> 00:10:24,646
Avalon, Atlantis...

150
00:10:24,686 --> 00:10:26,084
The Easter bunny.

151
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,678
I guess there's a few exceptions.

152
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:33,074
Are you saying that there's
time-travel technology here?

153
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:34,872
I'm saying there could be anything around here.

154
00:10:34,912 --> 00:10:36,630
Well, I hate to break it to you folks,

155
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,346
but the only technology I'm seeing is a

156
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,863
bunch of dusty old books.

157
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:50,052
And a secret passage.

158
00:10:57,841 --> 00:10:59,439
Alright, there's another chamber.

159
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:01,137
We should not go in there.

160
00:11:01,936 --> 00:11:04,732
We've tempted fate enough for one night.

161
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:06,409
Well, you can stay up here if you want.

162
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,248
<i>No.</i>

163
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:09,526
I shall take my leave.

164
00:11:46,077 --> 00:11:47,874
It's not a puzzle, is it?

165
00:11:48,872 --> 00:11:51,669
No, it's an Ancient control device.

166
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:54,066
What does it control?

167
00:11:54,865 --> 00:11:56,663
I have no idea.

168
00:12:22,228 --> 00:12:23,626
Livia?

169
00:12:40,004 --> 00:12:42,002
We've seen this type of interface before.

170
00:12:42,301 --> 00:12:45,696
Activating it is a matter of correctly
interpreting these symbols.

171
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:07,867
He's dead.

172
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:17,255
How do you explain this?

173
00:13:23,048 --> 00:13:24,325
Antonius

174
00:13:24,406 --> 00:13:26,842
had it with him when he was killed.

175
00:13:26,882 --> 00:13:30,957
- Meurik, we're very sorry about what happened...
- You went into the wizard's library, didn't you?

176
00:13:30,996 --> 00:13:31,965
Yes, we did.

177
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:33,932
<i>Look, it wasn't supposed to go down like that.</i>

178
00:13:34,072 --> 00:13:36,150
We figured if the knight was gonna appear,
it would be in the chamber,

179
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:38,107
and he wouldn't go after anybody but us.

180
00:13:38,146 --> 00:13:41,542
You were warned of the danger,
and you refused to believe.

181
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:43,420
And you awakened the curse.

182
00:13:43,819 --> 00:13:45,816
The black knight is not part of any curse.

183
00:13:46,016 --> 00:13:49,931
<i>- He isn't magical and he isn't unbeatable.
- Your world, as well as countless others,</i>

184
00:13:50,071 --> 00:13:55,104
are in danger of being overrun by an enemy far
more powerful than you could ever imagine.

185
00:13:55,124 --> 00:13:56,602
They are called the Ori,

186
00:13:56,642 --> 00:13:59,878
and they will destroy
anyone who does not kneel before them.

187
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:01,835
We learned that a long time ago
Merlin was working on a weapon

188
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:05,789
that could be used against them, and the key
to finding that weapon is inside that library.

189
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:08,985
We have neither seen nor heard of these Ori,

190
00:14:09,904 --> 00:14:13,379
but we have witnessed
the power of the black knight.

191
00:14:15,217 --> 00:14:16,774
Leave this village.

192
00:14:18,373 --> 00:14:20,170
Take the curse with you.

193
00:14:28,759 --> 00:14:30,557
Well, we can't just give up.

194
00:14:31,554 --> 00:14:33,752
Daniel, we're not exactly welcome here anymore.

195
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:36,348
<i>Don't you see, this is exactly what Merlin wanted.</i>

196
00:14:36,388 --> 00:14:39,744
Why do you think he designed the black knight
to attack in the village and not in the chamber?

197
00:14:40,063 --> 00:14:41,342
To incite terror.

198
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:45,616
<i>If it just killed whoever was inside
the chamber, then there'd be no great
public incentive to keep people out.</i>

199
00:14:45,655 --> 00:14:47,613
You'd go in at your own risk
and there'd always be someone

200
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:51,008
- foolish enough to give it a try.
- Yeah. Someone like us.

201
00:14:51,049 --> 00:14:51,928
<i>But the point is</i>

202
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,684
that he designed it that way because
he was worried someone might stumble onto the solution,

203
00:14:54,723 --> 00:14:57,320
which means there is a solution,
and it's inside that chamber.

204
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,319
A shut-off switch.

205
00:14:58,359 --> 00:14:59,118
Exactly.

206
00:14:59,158 --> 00:15:00,316
<i>Well, that's great,</i>

207
00:15:00,715 --> 00:15:02,513
but how does it help us now?

208
00:15:03,112 --> 00:15:04,311
I don't know.

209
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:05,938
Just...

210
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:08,305
give me a little time to talk to these people.
If I can get

211
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:12,100
some of them on our side,
we might be able to get Meurik to reconsider.

212
00:15:26,841 --> 00:15:31,075
<i>Only he who is pure of heart and true of spirit
can pull the sword from the stone.</i>

213
00:15:32,074 --> 00:15:36,667
It is said Arthur will not return from his quest
until one among us succeeds in removing it.

214
00:15:36,967 --> 00:15:38,365
You ever try it?

215
00:15:38,465 --> 00:15:39,663
Of course not.

216
00:15:40,582 --> 00:15:44,257
It is for the young men who are preparing
to be knights to test themselves with the sword,

217
00:15:44,297 --> 00:15:46,654
as my brother Ramus will do when he comes of age.

218
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:49,051
Yeah, but I've seen you spar.

219
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:50,449
You've got skills.

220
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:53,545
I only do that to help Ramus train.

221
00:15:53,684 --> 00:15:54,693
When Arthur does come back,

222
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,900
he will need knights
to join him on his next crusade.

223
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,437
The men of this village will be ready to serve him.

224
00:15:59,477 --> 00:16:01,634
And you're not interested in that?

225
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,261
<i>Valencia!</i>

226
00:16:03,271 --> 00:16:04,430
Leave us.

227
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:05,229
Yes, Governor.

228
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:07,825
You abuse my tolerant nature, Colonel.

229
00:16:10,422 --> 00:16:12,619
I take it it didn't go so well.

230
00:16:12,659 --> 00:16:14,217
Not really.

231
00:16:14,357 --> 00:16:19,399
These men will escort you to the great ring
and ensure that you leave, as requested.

232
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:21,607
Look, you're making a mistake.
There is no curse.

233
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:26,270
Now, the black knight is a security feature
created by Merlin through the use of science
and advanced technology. There is

234
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,999
no magic involv...

235
00:16:39,183 --> 00:16:41,180
SG-1, welcome aboard the Odyssey.

236
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,577
Colonel, what's going on?

237
00:16:43,618 --> 00:16:44,775
Change of plans.

238
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:51,168
We received a subspace transmission
from a Jaffa vessel near P3Y-229.

239
00:16:51,407 --> 00:16:53,793
They were investigating some unusual energy readings.

240
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:55,161
This is what they found.

241
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,158
<i>And if we enhance the image.</i>

242
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:03,351
A fully formed Supergate.

243
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:06,746
Stargate Command tried to dial
229 but couldn't get a lock.

244
00:17:06,787 --> 00:17:09,542
The planet was probably destroyed
in the formation of the microsingularity.

245
00:17:09,582 --> 00:17:12,618
My orders were to pick you up and
proceed immediately to the Supergate.

246
00:17:12,658 --> 00:17:14,935
Unfortunately, the Daedalus is
still in the Pegasus galaxy,

247
00:17:15,175 --> 00:17:17,462
but the Korolev
will be joining us as soon as possible.

248
00:17:17,472 --> 00:17:18,960
I don't think it was operational yet.

249
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,367
It's been rushed into service.

250
00:17:20,508 --> 00:17:23,544
<i>We're to meet up with as many Jaffa
and Tok'ra ships as we can muster,</i>

251
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:26,020
and destroy that thing
by whatever means necessary.

252
00:17:26,939 --> 00:17:27,698
Set a course.

253
00:17:27,738 --> 00:17:28,417
<i>Yes, Sir.</i>

254
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:29,576
Wait a minute. We

255
00:17:29,616 --> 00:17:30,934
can't go yet.

256
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,011
We don't have any more time, Doctor.

257
00:17:33,051 --> 00:17:35,248
By all indications, that space Gate's operational.

258
00:17:35,288 --> 00:17:37,685
There's no telling when the Ori
are going to start sending ships through.

259
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,361
Okay, go, but leave me behind.

260
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,116
Colonel, I believe the key
to defeating the Ori is on that planet.

261
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:44,875
I know it.

262
00:17:44,915 --> 00:17:48,231
Daniel, even if you're right, the villagers
never going to let you back in the library.

263
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,988
Then beam me in.

264
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:53,574
Alright.

265
00:17:53,584 --> 00:17:54,782
You get one more chance.

266
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:56,060
<i>I'll go with Jackson.</i>

267
00:17:56,619 --> 00:17:58,057
A little quality time.

268
00:17:58,796 --> 00:18:00,964
And that black knight might show up again.

269
00:18:00,974 --> 00:18:03,969
We'll have the Russians swing by and pick you
up on the way through. You have until then.

270
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,168
Thank you, Sir.

271
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:18,410
So, what now?

272
00:18:18,829 --> 00:18:23,742
Well, all indications are the black knight was
activated the second I stepped onto that platform, so

273
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:26,180
my guess is we can shut him down by

274
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:29,135
inputting the correct code
sequence on that control panel.

275
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,971
<i>- Merlin's P.I.N. number?
- Yeah, something like that.</i>

276
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,168
So how do we find it?

277
00:18:35,387 --> 00:18:36,506
By...

278
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:38,703
analyzing these documents.

279
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:41,858
You do realize we're on the clock, right?

280
00:18:45,574 --> 00:18:46,891
Course is plotted, Sir.

281
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:48,090
Very well.

282
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,129
Colonel Emerson,

283
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:52,045
I wish to be transferred to the
nearest Jaffa-controlled vessel.

284
00:18:52,284 --> 00:18:53,523
Can I ask why?

285
00:18:53,563 --> 00:18:55,919
I intend to seek out some much needed allies.

286
00:19:06,665 --> 00:19:07,784
That's it.

287
00:19:14,514 --> 00:19:16,432
<i>Sorry. Didn't mean to wake you.</i>

288
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:19,387
No... I wasn't sleeping.

289
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,304
I was Kel'noreeming.

290
00:19:22,943 --> 00:19:24,751
Teal'c taught me the fundamentals.

291
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,477
Did he mention you should
remain conscious in the process?

292
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:30,173
Yeah, I'm still working on the basics.

293
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:32,031
So...

294
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:34,587
you got something?

295
00:19:34,728 --> 00:19:35,457
Yeah, I've...

296
00:19:35,467 --> 00:19:37,743
cross-referenced half a dozen
passages that mention the black knight.

297
00:19:37,783 --> 00:19:41,138
Now, there's a series of recurring
words and phrases that stand out, if you

298
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:42,527
<i>know what you're looking for.</i>

299
00:19:42,537 --> 00:19:44,414
Are we talking access code?

300
00:19:45,013 --> 00:19:46,412
I think so.

301
00:19:59,334 --> 00:20:00,413
What's the matter?

302
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:02,670
Well, if I'm wrong about this, then...

303
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:05,426
Nah, look I'll take care of the black knight.

304
00:20:05,666 --> 00:20:07,743
Yeah, how are you going to do that, again?

305
00:20:07,863 --> 00:20:10,569
I will pull the sword from
the stone, just like last time.

306
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:13,894
Well, I think we've been over this.
This is a completely different scenario.

307
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:15,202
You see, in the Avalon cave, it was

308
00:20:15,212 --> 00:20:17,809
pulling the sword from the stone
that caused the knight to appear in the first place.

309
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:19,807
Here, we don't even know if they're connected.

310
00:20:20,825 --> 00:20:23,551
- We know Merlin put the sword there, right?
- Probably.

311
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:27,675
Which means it's no ordinary sword,
and that's good enough for me. Besides,

312
00:20:28,035 --> 00:20:30,033
<i>- do we have a choice?
- No.</i>

313
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,469
Nothing happened.

314
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,926
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

315
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:06,903
- Bad.
- Bad.

316
00:21:07,863 --> 00:21:09,300
You stay. I'll go.

317
00:21:09,739 --> 00:21:10,738
Make it work!

318
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,136
Okay.

319
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:17,928
Oh, boy.

320
00:21:23,841 --> 00:21:25,718
Everybody down!

321
00:21:31,989 --> 00:21:33,787
No. Didn't think so.

322
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:53,654
Mitchell, how's it going out there?

323
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:55,411
Not so good.

324
00:22:05,677 --> 00:22:07,555
Do something! Help him!

325
00:22:08,353 --> 00:22:10,311
He brought this on himself.

326
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:27,847
What do you think you're doing?

327
00:23:09,051 --> 00:23:10,490
Greetings, friend.

328
00:23:10,989 --> 00:23:12,068
I am Merlin.

329
00:23:12,806 --> 00:23:13,855
Yes, you are.

330
00:23:13,865 --> 00:23:15,343
<i>The prize you seek,</i>

331
00:23:15,383 --> 00:23:17,101
like the pendulum's swing,

332
00:23:17,241 --> 00:23:20,676
marks the passage of all that is before you.

333
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:24,251
Mitchell, I did it.
Is the black knight gone?

334
00:23:24,631 --> 00:23:25,869
Not exactly.

335
00:23:30,284 --> 00:23:32,989
I don't understand. I've got the
treasure, activated the hologram...

336
00:23:32,999 --> 00:23:33,759
<i>Greetings</i>

337
00:23:37,593 --> 00:23:38,662
Try a different code!

338
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:41,029
<i>I already tried all the combinations I came up with.</i>

339
00:23:41,228 --> 00:23:44,145
<i>- Marks the passage of all that is before you.
- Mitchell?</i>

340
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:45,972
Mitchell!

341
00:23:45,982 --> 00:23:47,100
Greetings, friend.

342
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,738
<i>I am Merlin.</i>

343
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,387
All that is before you.

344
00:23:57,806 --> 00:23:59,245
<i>Greetings, friend.</i>

345
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:00,992
<i>I am Merlin.</i>

346
00:24:01,002 --> 00:24:02,400
<i>The prize you seek,</i>

347
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,038
<i>like the pendulum's swing,</i>

348
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:07,263

00:24:07,273 --> 00:24:08,552
<i>Greetings, friend.</i>

350
00:24:08,591 --> 00:24:09,950
Oh, screw it.

351
00:24:12,227 --> 00:24:13,585
Like the pendulu...

352
00:24:17,001 --> 00:24:18,878
<i>- Look! Look!
- Where did it go? He has done it</i>

353
00:25:00,682 --> 00:25:01,201
Sir...

354
00:25:01,341 --> 00:25:03,867
we're receiving a transmission
from one of the Jaffa ships.

355
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:04,996
Put it on screen.

356
00:25:06,714 --> 00:25:08,991
I am Cha'ra of the free Jaffa.

357
00:25:09,031 --> 00:25:11,307
It was my ship that discovered the Gate.

358
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:13,584
I understand there's been
no other signs of activity.

359
00:25:13,624 --> 00:25:14,623
<i>None.</i>

360
00:25:14,663 --> 00:25:17,779
You should be aware
we've already attempted to destroy the Gate.

361
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:20,375
Our combined forces had no effect.

362
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:31,021
So all you had to do
was shoot the control crystals?

363
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,119
Pretty much.

364
00:25:32,758 --> 00:25:34,197
Sounds like one of my plans.

365
00:25:34,237 --> 00:25:36,434
How come we didn't do that in the first place?

366
00:25:36,554 --> 00:25:39,270
Well, because I had
to find the access code first.

367
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,628
If I hadn't, none of

368
00:25:40,828 --> 00:25:42,426
this would've beamed in, and I

369
00:25:42,466 --> 00:25:44,143
wouldn't have seen Merlin's hologram message.

370
00:25:44,183 --> 00:25:45,701
Right. What did he say?

371
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,818
Well, I think it was a riddle

372
00:25:48,018 --> 00:25:50,535
and I believe I figured it out.

373
00:25:52,132 --> 00:25:52,891
You see

374
00:25:52,931 --> 00:25:53,890
<i>this pendant?</i>

375
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,367
Now, in every depiction of Merlin from his library,

376
00:25:56,687 --> 00:25:57,406
I've seen it, and

377
00:25:57,445 --> 00:25:59,323
in fact, in the hologram message,
he was wearing it as well.

378
00:25:59,363 --> 00:26:00,601
But I've never seen it before,

379
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:02,758
not in any reference material back on Earth.

380
00:26:03,637 --> 00:26:05,994
And you think
that's the device we're looking for?

381
00:26:06,034 --> 00:26:07,711
The riddle mentions a pendulum.

382
00:26:07,751 --> 00:26:09,189
Now, at first I thought that was a reference to...

383
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:10,828
a passage of time, like a pendulum clock,

384
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:12,225
then I realized it was more literal...

385
00:26:12,306 --> 00:26:13,664
something that hangs.

386
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,340
It also said it was right before my eyes.

387
00:26:19,316 --> 00:26:20,394
<i>I don't know.</i>

388
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:22,252
Doesn't that seem a little small?

389
00:26:22,492 --> 00:26:23,520
Just remember, we're talking about things that

390
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,766
transcend ordinary space-time here.
Relative size has no meaning.

391
00:26:29,962 --> 00:26:31,360
Fine. Let's start looking.

392
00:26:33,957 --> 00:26:36,273
Sir, another ship just dropped out of hyperspace.

393
00:26:36,313 --> 00:26:37,672
It's an Asgard vessel.

394
00:26:37,811 --> 00:26:38,889
Open a channel.

395
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:43,004
This is Colonel Emerson
of the Earth vessel Odyssey.

396
00:26:44,522 --> 00:26:45,321
Yes.

397
00:26:45,361 --> 00:26:46,799
I know who you are.

398
00:26:47,118 --> 00:26:48,038
Hello, Kvasir.

399
00:26:48,277 --> 00:26:49,236
<i>Colonel Carter.</i>

400
00:26:49,556 --> 00:26:51,512
There is much work to be done.

401
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:53,350
Where is the rest of your team?

402
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,864
Daniel and colonel Mitchell are still
looking for the Ancient device I was
telling you about in our communiqué,

403
00:26:57,904 --> 00:26:59,103
<i>and Teal'c...</i>

404
00:27:01,898 --> 00:27:05,054
well, we're not exactly sure where Teal'c is.

405
00:27:26,346 --> 00:27:28,423
Flying into our territory

406
00:27:28,622 --> 00:27:30,860
in an unmarked cargo ship.

407
00:27:32,798 --> 00:27:34,795
I didn't think you were that stupid.

408
00:27:34,835 --> 00:27:37,630
I have allowed myself to be captured knowing

409
00:27:37,671 --> 00:27:39,628
that I would be brought before you.

410
00:27:39,947 --> 00:27:41,106
Really?

411
00:27:41,426 --> 00:27:44,621
I have come to seek
the assistance of the Lucian Alliance.

412
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,459
I take it back.

413
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:48,736
You're not stupid.

414
00:27:49,735 --> 00:27:51,093
You're insane.

415
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:52,251
Kill him.

416
00:28:04,314 --> 00:28:06,152
I should kill you where you stand...

417
00:28:08,189 --> 00:28:09,908
but as I have said,

418
00:28:11,146 --> 00:28:13,702
I have come seeking your assistance.

419
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:16,179
The fate of the galaxy is at stake.

420
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:26,565
We have been analyzing the information

421
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:30,480
that Daniel Jackson was able
to retrieve from Merlin's phase-shifting device.

422
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,115
Unfortunately, he didn't get
very far before it permanently ran out of power.

423
00:28:34,156 --> 00:28:38,869
There was enough data for us to summise
what this so-called anti-Ori weapon might be.

424
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:39,987
Really?

425
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:42,424
I wasn't able to make heads or tails of it.

426
00:28:42,464 --> 00:28:43,463
Really?

427
00:28:44,661 --> 00:28:46,299
Just tell me what you've got.

428
00:28:46,339 --> 00:28:48,136
<i>It is an energy transfer device,</i>

429
00:28:48,176 --> 00:28:50,174
similar to a Zero Point Module,

430
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:52,131
except that the energy is channeled

431
00:28:52,171 --> 00:28:54,767
not from subspace into ordinary space-time,

432
00:28:54,968 --> 00:28:58,323
but rather, into the dimension
occupied by ascended beings.

433
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:00,720
And this energy is harmful to them in some way?

434
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:02,358
<i>It is a form of interference.</i>

435
00:29:02,397 --> 00:29:05,074
A simple analogy would be two standing waves

436
00:29:05,114 --> 00:29:06,831
canceling each other out.

437
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:09,947
<i>If the weapon indeed works
the way Merlin's writings imply,</i>

438
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:11,665
we would simply need to activate it,

439
00:29:11,704 --> 00:29:13,702
and send it to the Ori galaxy,

440
00:29:13,822 --> 00:29:15,579
and they would be eliminated.

441
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,858
Yeah, but how do we do that?

442
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:18,975
I mean, we don't even
know where the Ori galaxy is,

443
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:21,172
let alone have
the ability to send something there.

444
00:29:21,212 --> 00:29:23,089
That is where you're mistaken.

445
00:29:25,266 --> 00:29:27,144
You're talking about the Supergate.

446
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:29,680
We dial out before they can dial in.

447
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,038
Precisely.

448
00:29:31,958 --> 00:29:33,196
That might actually work.

449
00:29:33,235 --> 00:29:35,353
Of course, we will need Merlin's weapon.

450
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:37,869
If colonel Mitchell and Dr. Jackson don't find it...

451
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,048
Don't worry,

452
00:29:39,148 --> 00:29:40,066
they'll find it.

453
00:29:43,821 --> 00:29:45,380
What do you mean, it's not here?

454
00:29:46,138 --> 00:29:48,735
Well, we've been through this stuff twice.
It's not here.

455
00:29:48,835 --> 00:29:51,271
It's got to be here!
Look...

456
00:29:51,551 --> 00:29:54,627
I once lost my car keys
in my apartment for three days...

457
00:29:54,666 --> 00:29:55,746
<i>Colonel Mitchell?</i>

458
00:29:58,022 --> 00:29:58,821
<i>Hi.</i>

459
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,258
Come on in.

460
00:30:01,697 --> 00:30:03,175
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

461
00:30:03,734 --> 00:30:05,333
The black knight's not coming back.

462
00:30:10,565 --> 00:30:11,604
It's incredible.

463
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:12,523
Yeah.

464
00:30:13,402 --> 00:30:14,720
It's all yours.

465
00:30:15,879 --> 00:30:19,193
You do not wish to claim a prize
for defeating Merlin's champion?

466
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,792
Well, there was one thing

467
00:30:20,931 --> 00:30:22,859
we were looking for, but we can't find it.

468
00:30:22,869 --> 00:30:24,906
<i>Actually, maybe you can help us.</i>

469
00:30:33,894 --> 00:30:35,132
Do you recognize

470
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:36,012
this?

471
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:40,885
It is the Sangreal.

472
00:30:41,803 --> 00:30:43,880
This is the Sangreal?

473
00:30:43,921 --> 00:30:46,158
It is also known as the bloodstone.

474
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:47,555
Of course. "Sang"...

475
00:30:47,995 --> 00:30:50,152
blood. Blood-red, for the color of the jewel.

476
00:30:51,231 --> 00:30:55,266
Wait a minute. We're talking about the Holy Grail,
right? Every movie I've seen, that's a cup.

477
00:30:55,546 --> 00:30:55,984
No.

478
00:30:56,044 --> 00:30:56,843
The notion that

479
00:30:56,883 --> 00:30:58,212
the Grail was a cup or chalice,

480
00:30:58,222 --> 00:31:00,418
particularly the one used
by Christ at the Last Supper was a

481
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:01,656
a late addition to the myth.

482
00:31:01,697 --> 00:31:03,614
<i>In earlier accounts,
it's described variously as a dish,</i>

483
00:31:03,654 --> 00:31:04,413
or platter,

484
00:31:04,453 --> 00:31:08,527
or, in the case of Von Eschenbach and other
middle eastern influenced chroniclers, as a stone

485
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:10,325
that fell from the heavens.

486
00:31:10,365 --> 00:31:12,163
<i>If this is what you seek</i>

487
00:31:12,562 --> 00:31:14,719
you will not find it among these trinkets.

488
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:16,677
Arthur and his knights

489
00:31:16,717 --> 00:31:19,752
left to quest to the Sangreal long ago.

490
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:21,870
Do you know where they went?

491
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,307
Of course.

492
00:31:24,146 --> 00:31:29,619
It is said that they journeyed to three
distant lands mentioned in Merlin's prophecy...

493
00:31:29,779 --> 00:31:30,897
Castiana,

494
00:31:30,938 --> 00:31:32,096
Sahal

495
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:33,694
and Vagonbrei.

496
00:31:34,453 --> 00:31:35,891
Any of those spots ring a bell?

497
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,888
No, but if they were part of
one of Merlin's prophecies,

498
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:40,814
then any one of those books could hold
the key to what we're looking for.

499
00:31:40,824 --> 00:31:42,022
The books upstairs?

500
00:31:42,262 --> 00:31:47,455
Jackson, that's days, weeks, to find
the proper reference and then there's no guarantee
that we're going to be able to track'em down.

501
00:31:47,496 --> 00:31:51,850
Searching for Arthur's whereabouts
in this library is not necessary.

502
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:52,689
Now...

503
00:31:54,047 --> 00:31:59,159
thanks to Valencia, we've been given
a sign that Arthur will return soon, and you

504
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:02,075
are welcome to stay with us and wait as

505
00:32:02,195 --> 00:32:03,164
the men

506
00:32:03,174 --> 00:32:07,249
that conquered Merlin's curse,
you will be given a place of honor.

507
00:32:07,288 --> 00:32:08,127
Look,

508
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:10,804
once and for all, there was no curse...

509
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:12,112
okay? This...

510
00:32:12,122 --> 00:32:13,320
this is a device,

511
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,258
it's a machine, it's like...

512
00:32:15,398 --> 00:32:19,033
<i>a flour mill or a catapult.
It's just a lot more complicated.</i>

513
00:32:19,093 --> 00:32:20,810
There is no magic.

514
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,386
Boy, my timing is off today.

515
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:35,111
Colonel Mitchell, Dr. Jackson,
welcome aboard the Korolev.

516
00:32:41,303 --> 00:32:42,462
There it is.

517
00:32:45,078 --> 00:32:46,037
Colonel Carter.

518
00:32:46,077 --> 00:32:46,876
<i>Sir,</i>

519
00:32:47,075 --> 00:32:51,029
we've managed to locate the dialing
control crystals, on one particular section of the Gate.

520
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:53,226
Now, Kvasir's already programmed
a replacement crystal,

521
00:32:53,267 --> 00:32:56,183
so it's just a matter of somebody
getting out there and installing it.

522
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:58,220
And I suppose you'd like to volunteer.

523
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,299
Yes, Sir.

524
00:32:59,339 --> 00:33:00,337
<i>I would go,</i>

525
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:03,093
but you do not have
a space suit that would fit me.

526
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:07,248
No one's going.

527
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:08,726
<i>We just got word from the Korolev.</i>

528
00:33:08,766 --> 00:33:10,843
<i>Mitchell and Jackson didn't find the device.</i>

529
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:14,038
Sir, even without Merlin's device,
dialing out is still our best bet,

530
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,114
because, in the very least, it will
prevent them from dialing in.

531
00:33:17,474 --> 00:33:20,110
Well, it's possible that with the power
generated by the singularity,

532
00:33:20,151 --> 00:33:22,547
we can maintain this connection indefinitely.

533
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,678
The coordinates are set.

534
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:47,593
Are you ready, Colonel Carter?

535
00:33:47,633 --> 00:33:49,111
Ready as I'll ever be.

536
00:33:53,505 --> 00:33:55,623
Initiating transport.

537
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:11,042
<i>Engaging magnetic lock.</i>

538
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:28,878
I'm removing the panel now.

539
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,397
<i>I'm putting in our control crystal.</i>

540
00:34:58,218 --> 00:35:00,695
It'll just take a few minutes to initialize.

541
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,846
Sir, we're picking up increased
energy output coming from the Gate.

542
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,677
Something's happening.

543
00:35:16,555 --> 00:35:18,511
I've lost my magnetic lock!

544
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,767
<i>It's an incoming wormhole.</i>

545
00:35:22,586 --> 00:35:24,383
Get her out of there, now.

546
00:35:24,423 --> 00:35:25,422
It's not working.

547
00:35:25,462 --> 00:35:26,900
There's too much interference.

548
00:35:28,098 --> 00:35:29,537
Sam, report.

549
00:35:31,055 --> 00:35:32,093
Sam!

550
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:48,891
Oh, my god.

551
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,425
Can you pick up colonel Carter's signal?

552
00:35:55,064 --> 00:35:55,624
Negative.

553
00:35:55,764 --> 00:35:57,881
She's too close to the event horizon.

554
00:36:07,089 --> 00:36:09,455
Sir, the Korolev just dropped out of hyperspace.

555
00:36:09,465 --> 00:36:10,424
<i>This is colonel Chekov.</i>

556
00:36:10,663 --> 00:36:11,892
What is the situation?

557
00:36:11,902 --> 00:36:13,260
<i>We've got an incoming wormhole.</i>

558
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,098
<i>I'd suggest you prepare for battle.</i>

559
00:36:19,771 --> 00:36:21,090
Here they come.

560
00:36:49,252 --> 00:36:52,168
- I only count four ships.
- It's probably their first wave.

561
00:36:52,767 --> 00:36:55,084
We should see what we can do
about discouraging a second one.

562
00:37:01,236 --> 00:37:02,034
Sir...

563
00:37:02,234 --> 00:37:05,630
we're receiving a message
from one of the Ori ships, text only.

564
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:07,507
What does it say?

565
00:37:07,867 --> 00:37:09,345
"And those who are prideful

566
00:37:09,385 --> 00:37:11,023
and refuse to bow down

567
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,818
shall be laid low and made unto dust."

568
00:37:16,415 --> 00:37:17,773
Is that all it says?

569
00:37:17,813 --> 00:37:18,692
Yeah, that's it.

570
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:19,531
Open a channel?

571
00:37:25,203 --> 00:37:27,919
"Then did Tyolus say to the people of the low plains,

572
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:32,793
seek not wickedness amongst your neighbors,
lest it find purchase in your own house."

573
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,207
- What was that?
- Book of Origin.

574
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:38,825
Think it'll help?

575
00:37:43,479 --> 00:37:45,517
They're powering up their weapons.

576
00:37:45,776 --> 00:37:46,775
Here we go.

577
00:37:46,894 --> 00:37:48,532
All batteries, open fire.

578
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,248
Shields down to 50%.

579
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:29,417
Sir, we just lost sublight engines.

580
00:38:37,127 --> 00:38:40,123
Redirect power to the engines!
Begin evasive maneuvers!

581
00:38:42,519 --> 00:38:43,998
We've lost power!

582
00:38:44,397 --> 00:38:45,995
We have to scramble the 302s!

583
00:38:46,035 --> 00:38:47,872
No, they'll have no effect against that.

584
00:38:47,912 --> 00:38:50,988
Hey, we're getting our asses kicked!
It's time to go all-in.

585
00:38:51,147 --> 00:38:53,944
I'll draw their fire
while you get the ship back online.

586
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,499
It's no good, Sir.

587
00:38:57,539 --> 00:38:58,817
We're dead in the water.

588
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,453
Sir, picking up approaching ships.

589
00:39:09,283 --> 00:39:11,241
Apologies for my late arrival.

590
00:39:11,401 --> 00:39:12,958
Better late than never.

591
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:14,557
Indeed.

592
00:39:15,056 --> 00:39:16,174
Forget the engines.

593
00:39:16,274 --> 00:39:17,752
Give 'em everything we got!
