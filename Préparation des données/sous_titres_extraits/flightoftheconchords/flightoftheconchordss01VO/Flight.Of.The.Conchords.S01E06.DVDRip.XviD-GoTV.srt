1
00:00:39,472 --> 00:00:42,305
Okay, band meeting.
Jemaine?

2
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:43,866
Yes.

3
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,276
Yes. Bret?

4
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:47,973
No.

5
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,641
What do
you mean no?

6
00:00:49,682 --> 00:00:51,479
- I'm not here.
- You're not here?

7
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:53,008
- No.
- Where are you?

8
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,315
No, I was just joking.

9
00:00:54,354 --> 00:00:56,345
You're obviously here so
I'm putting you down...

10
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:57,981
- Yeah, get on.
- All right.

11
00:00:58,024 --> 00:01:00,390
Murray, present.

12
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:02,156
Okay.

13
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:04,561
Item one:
Roll call.

14
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,929
Now I've got a sense
that you guys

15
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:09,400
aren't really up
for the roll call anymore.

16
00:01:09,436 --> 00:01:11,301
Well, I thought
we had to do it.

17
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,531
Officially we do.

18
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,836
But I could just
bypass it.

19
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,707
We'll just look and see
that you're here and carry on.

20
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,871
We're always in the band meetings...
we're the band.

21
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,711
But there's been a couple of times where
you haven't been here.

22
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:24,842
All right? And I've put
you down as "absent"

23
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:26,784
and I've just carried on
with the meeting.

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,788
We're at a band meeting.
We haven't been here?

25
00:01:28,822 --> 00:01:30,790
- Yeah, twice. I mean...
- When?

26
00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:34,260
Well, it doesn't matter when.
They didn't go very well.

27
00:01:34,294 --> 00:01:36,262
Item two,

28
00:01:36,296 --> 00:01:37,695
band photos.

29
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,630
Now we need to get
some better photos done

30
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:42,260
so that the American media
can take us seriously, all right?

31
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,361
Put us in magazines,
leaflets, that sort of thing.

32
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:45,803
We've got
a good photo.

33
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,103
We've got a photo,
but it's not good enough.

34
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:49,733
I mean, look.
This one.

35
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,835
- I like that one.
- It's a good photo.

36
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,039
But I've had to circle
where you two are.

37
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,048
I mean, who are all
these other people?

38
00:01:56,082 --> 00:01:58,312
- Well, that's Gemma's 21st.
- Right.

39
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,343
- That's her birthday.
- That's not me.

40
00:02:01,387 --> 00:02:03,378
- Oh no, that's Nick.
- Is that not you?

41
00:02:03,423 --> 00:02:05,015
- No.
- No, that's Lucas.

42
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:06,650
You've circled Lucas and Nick.

43
00:02:06,693 --> 00:02:08,388
- Who are they?
- They're my cousins.

44
00:02:08,428 --> 00:02:10,726
- Where are you?
- I think I took this photo.

45
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,560
- Yeah, I took it.
- So you're not in it?

46
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,089
No, neither of us
are in it.

47
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,796
- It's got a good energy.
- I know, I tell people that,

48
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:18,701
but they want to know
which ones are you,

49
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:20,262
and I'm trying
to point you out.

50
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,739
Have you got
any other photos?

51
00:02:21,774 --> 00:02:24,174
We've got one more.
This one's just bizarre.

52
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,008
It's a photo of Jemaine
with his ex-girlfriend Clea.

53
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:31,142
But it's got a photo of Bret
superimposed over the head.

54
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,584
- It's a wee bit strange.
- Where did you get that?

55
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,713
I made it.
I made this one.

56
00:02:35,755 --> 00:02:38,383
You can't take my personal photos
and stick other people's heads over...

57
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:39,982
I loved that photo.

58
00:02:40,026 --> 00:02:42,460
So those are you options.
All right?

59
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,725
I mean, this one here,
you're not in.

60
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,391
And this one here
you're in,

61
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,866
but you shouldn't be.

62
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,996
So my point is,
what we need to do

63
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,597
is what's called a...

64
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,541
photo shoot.

65
00:02:56,576 --> 00:02:59,238
Okay?

66
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:00,871
Okay.

67
00:03:00,914 --> 00:03:04,247
A bit more movement,
you're too up and down.

68
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,514
Move your arms about.

69
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:08,521
A bit more natural.
That's good.

70
00:03:08,555 --> 00:03:11,183
Can I have a look
in the camera, Murray?

71
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:13,317
No, this is New Zealand
government property.

72
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,260
It's a passport camera.
Only Greg can touch it... eh, Greg?

73
00:03:16,296 --> 00:03:18,924
- Uh, yeah.
- I can't even touch it.

74
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,866
That's good, Bret.

75
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,392
Jemaine, you look
depressed. Smile.

76
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:27,235
- I'm supposed to, I'm in a band.
- Who wants to hear a sad band?

77
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,070
This is the cool
look for a band.

78
00:03:29,108 --> 00:03:31,406
But what about your hands in the air
and smile?

79
00:03:31,444 --> 00:03:33,036
No that's not
what bands do.

80
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,343
Bands don't put their arms in
the air and smile.

81
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,246
I've seen that. I've seen musicians
do that.

82
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:39,080
- That's gymnasts, Murray.
- Is it?

83
00:03:39,118 --> 00:03:40,676
Yes.

84
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,415
Greg, is is musicians
or gymnasts that?

85
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:44,582
- Gymnasts.
- When they...

86
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,024
okay, it looks weird.

87
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,960
Um, Bret, you look
quite small.

88
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:51,088
It looks sort of like
trick photography.

89
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:53,758
- It's Bret's fault.
- It's like "Lord of the Rings."

90
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,291
Jemaine, you look like an ogre
that works in the library.

91
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,897
Yeah, I think it's your fault, Bret.
You're just too small.

92
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:07,004
Bret, do you, uh,
do you like penguins?

93
00:04:07,046 --> 00:04:09,139
Yeah... no.

94
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:12,345
Sometimes I'm glad that we don't live
in New Zealand anymore.

95
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:14,148
'Cause of all
those penguins.

96
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:17,054
- Remember how there'd be penguins?
- Yeah.

97
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,923
Bret, I'm kind of doing
all the work in this conversation.

98
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,622
- What's wrong?
- I'm feeling a bit body conscious.

99
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,496
- What do you mean, "body conscious"?
- I just feel very small.

100
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:29,365
After the photo shoot, I was a lot
smaller than I thought I was.

101
00:04:29,402 --> 00:04:31,427
- Are you bulimic or something?
- No.

102
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,961
I just feel like...

103
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:36,567
you know, all these novelty
musicians are a lot bigger than me.

104
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:38,406
- Is that what's made you bulimic?
- No.

105
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,071
I just need
to eat more.

106
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,105
Mm.
Sounds like bulimia.

107
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,741
I'm not bulimic.

108
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:48,117
Hey, Bret, do you remember that time
after your mom's 60th birthday,

109
00:04:48,154 --> 00:04:49,951
- how you got really drunk?
- Yeah.

110
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,389
Yeah, I think I heard you
in the bathroom afterwards

111
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,019
being a little bit
bulimic.

112
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:57,928
What I really need is just some...
just some compliments, I think.

113
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,194
You could give me some compliments.
That would do it.

114
00:05:00,233 --> 00:05:02,793
- You want me to give you a compliment?
- That'd be great, yeah.

115
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,327
I'm not gonna give you compliments.
It'd be weird.

116
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:08,203
Yeah, it might be
a bit weird.

117
00:05:08,241 --> 00:05:11,301
Don't worry about it.
I'm gonna go to bed.

118
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:30,192
Bret? Bret?

119
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:31,992
- Bret!
- Jemaine?

120
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,499
- What are you doing?
- It's not Jemaine.

121
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,833
It's 1972 David Bowie
from the Ziggy Stardust tour.

122
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:40,236
Wow, you look a lot
like Jemaine.

123
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,673
No, I'm David Bowie.

124
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:44,438
Mm, what are you
doing in my room?

125
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,206
This is a dream, Bret.

126
00:05:46,245 --> 00:05:48,770
It's all part
of your freaky dream.

127
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:51,750
- Oh, right.
- Am I freaking you out, Bret?

128
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:54,617
- Is this a freaky dream?
- I've had some pretty freaky dreams.

129
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:57,316
- Have you?
- I had one where I was a guinea pig,

130
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:59,052
but with my face.

131
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:01,185
And I had another one
where I was a...

132
00:06:01,227 --> 00:06:03,127
I was a giraffe,
but then...

133
00:06:03,162 --> 00:06:06,063
Yeah, okay. Listen, Bret,
I don't have much time, man.

134
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,626
I'm just here to tell you don't worry
about your body image.

135
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:13,070
People used to give me crap about
being thin all the time.

136
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,075
But I just broke through
their false barriers.

137
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:18,100
What about the novelty-music
paparazzi?

138
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:20,635
Oh, the media monkeys
and the junket junkies

139
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,478
will invite you to
the plastic pantomime.

140
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:25,609
Throw their invites away.

141
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,243
I'm not really sure what you're
talking about.

142
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,254
I want to give you
one more piece of advice.

143
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,620
Get an eye patch, man.

144
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:34,717
- I'm sorry?
- Get an eye patch.

145
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,456
Oh yeah,
I've got an eye patch.

146
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,827
- Do you?
- Yeah.

147
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:39,593
- Wear it.
- Okay.

148
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:42,226
# Wear the eye
patch, Bret #

149
00:06:42,268 --> 00:06:45,396
# Wear the funky
funky eye patch. #

150
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,906
- Bye, Bret.
- Bye-bye, David Bowie.

151
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:50,738
- Heed my advice, wear the eye patch.
- Watch out for the table!

152
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:53,610
Sorry about the table, Bret.

153
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,484
No no, he's not a midget.
He's just... he's thin.

154
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,889
Okay? And then the other one's
slightly bigger,

155
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,325
so there's two
different sizes there.

156
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,226
There's the full range.
Yeah.

157
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,754
- Okay, see you soon.
- Hey, Murray.

158
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,994
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Murray.

159
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,127
Check this out.

160
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,569
What is it?

161
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,663
It's the latest copy of
"Novelty Hit-Makers" Magazine.

162
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:22,901
Page eight,
I've bookmarked it there.

163
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,501
- Hey.
- Yeah.

164
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:28,104
- Oh, that's us.
- That's right.

165
00:07:28,147 --> 00:07:30,047
We're in it. Did you stick that
on there?

166
00:07:30,082 --> 00:07:32,277
- No, it's real, Jemaine.
- Wow.

167
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,149
- Bret, what's wrong with your eye?
- Hmm?

168
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:36,849
Oh nothing's wrong with it.
This is my new look.

169
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,481
- New look?
- Yeah.

170
00:07:38,524 --> 00:07:40,788
If you're gonna be cool,
why don't you just have a goatee?

171
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:43,591
- This photo... looks silly.
- Silly?

172
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,029
You look silly now. That's a good
photo... what do you mean?

173
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:49,193
- Bret's bulimic.
- What? No, I'm not.

174
00:07:49,235 --> 00:07:51,931
- Are you?
- No. I had some body-image issues,

175
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,632
but I'm all good now.

176
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:56,164
Well, that's not
really my business,

177
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,973
that's sort of regarded
as personal business.

178
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:01,844
All right? I'm dealing with
the business side of things.

179
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,076
Like that photo.
That's got us some heat.

180
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:05,879
We've got a big meeting
coming up.

181
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,045
Is it a major record label
or something?

182
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,318
No, it's the next best thing. It's
a company that sells greeting cards.

183
00:08:11,357 --> 00:08:12,949
- Greeting cards?
- Mm.

184
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,825
But you know those ones that
open up and they have a tune in them?

185
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:17,489
Where does it
come from?

186
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,657
You don't know. It's in the card
somewhere.

187
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:21,860
- It's not an album?
- No.

188
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,995
That's the whole thing.
It's a secret. Only they know.

189
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:26,834
- They put a tape in there?
- No.

190
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,841
It's a magic card
with music in it,

191
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:32,106
and they want us to be
part of their magic cards.

192
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:34,271
So just from here on
what I think we should do

193
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:36,213
is just keep cool heads.
Bret,

194
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:37,910
all right,
don't be bulimic;

195
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,815
Jemaine, you know,
look after Bret;

196
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,320
and me, just don't
blow this one, I guess.

197
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,314
- Mmm.
- So all of us, let's rock it out.

198
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,327
Is that a music term,
"Rock it out"?

199
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,692
Yeah, that's one.

200
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,391
Okay.
Oh heavens.

201
00:08:55,001 --> 00:08:58,493
You know how you tend to prefer me
out of me and Bret?

202
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,598
- No.
- Yeah, when you see us,

203
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:04,405
you just flirt a little bit more
with me.

204
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:05,910
A tiny... sorry, Doug.

205
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:07,879
It's fine.

206
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:10,439
- Happy anniversary, by the way.
- Thanks.

207
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,610
- Happy anniversary.
- Thanks, Jemaine.

208
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:14,347
- You know, you'd prefer me?
- Yes...

209
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,752
- Right?
- Yeah?

210
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:18,086
Yeah well, just pretend
you prefer Bret.

211
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:19,318
Okay.

212
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:20,723
Give him
some compliments.

213
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,728
Say, like,
"You look hot," or...

214
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:25,162
l-I don't really know,
it's not my forte.

215
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:28,030
Okay, I can do that. It'll be like our
secret plan together.

216
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,864
Exactly, thanks.
It'll just help him

217
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:31,961
with a medical condition
that he's got.

218
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:35,235
I'd compliment him myself but I think it
might be gay.

219
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,708
Oh no, that's not gay
at all.

220
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,301
- Isn't it?
- Oh no.

221
00:09:39,345 --> 00:09:41,575
To tell a friend he looks good?
No, that's not gay.

222
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,548
Maybe I will.

223
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,484
I mean, if you two were to make love,
that would be gay.

224
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,886
Yeah, that would be...
that would be gay.

225
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,652
Two men, touching
each other physically

226
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,320
and emotionally.

227
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,693
Erotically caressing
each other on the...

228
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,460
- Yeah, that sounds more...
...hood of a car...

229
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,160
Hey, thanks for
your help anyway.

230
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,896
...in the back
of a movie theater.

231
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,769
Hey, Mel, what do you do here,
at university, I was wondering.

232
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,434
Oh, I'm the junior
professor of psychology.

233
00:10:09,475 --> 00:10:10,772
Huh.

234
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:13,574
What do you
do here, Doug?

235
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,013
I was the senior professor
of psychology.

236
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,414
But I was fired.

237
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,442
And now I just
hang around here.

238
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:27,950
Hey, Bret?

239
00:10:27,994 --> 00:10:30,758
Oh hey, man.
How's it going?

240
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:37,598
Your beard is good.

241
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:40,197
It's just a compliment
for you... your beard.

242
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,673
Just a compliment about
your beard being good.

243
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:45,006
- Thank you.
- And also I have another one here:

244
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:48,605
You're good at finding
shortcuts around this part of town.

245
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:50,115
I appreciate that.

246
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:52,117
Would it be gay
to write you a song

247
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,119
to cheer you up?

248
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,916
No.

249
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:04,356
It's called, "Bret,
you got it going on."

250
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:07,127
# Hey there, Bret,
I see you looking down #

251
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,600
# Don't want to see
my little buddy down with a frown #

252
00:11:09,635 --> 00:11:11,967
# Just because I get
more women than you #

253
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:14,336
# Well, that's only because
they don't know you like I do #

254
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,500
# Sure you're weedy
and kinda shy #

255
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:19,306
# But some girlie out there must
be needy for a weedy shy guy #

256
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,041
# They want you as their needle
when they're rolling in the hay #

257
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:23,673
# Just hear me out
when I say #

258
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:27,311
# Bret, you've got it
going on #

259
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,288
# The ladies will get
to know your sexuality #

260
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:33,018
# When they get to know
your personality #

261
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:36,893
# I said, Bret,
you've got it going on #

262
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:40,160
# Not in a gay way, just in a hey, man,
I wanted to say #

263
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:43,134
# That you're looking okay, man,
why can't a heterosexual guy #

264
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,536
# Tell a heterosexual guy
that he thinks his booty is fly? #

265
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:48,267
# Not all the time,
obviously #

266
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,298
# Just when he's got a problem
with his self-esteem #

267
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:52,401
# Don't let anybody tell you
you're not hump-able #

268
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,844
# Because you're bump-able #

269
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,676
# Well, I hope this doesn't make you
feel uncomfortable #

270
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:58,343
# If I say you gotta
boom-ow-ow, come on, Bret #

271
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,343
# Help me out now,
Bret, you've got it going on #

272
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:04,049
# I got it going on #

273
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,785
# That's the conclusion
that I've come to #

274
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:08,020
# But that doesn't mean
that I want to bum you #

275
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,995
# Bret, you've got it
going on #

276
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,463
# I got it going on #

277
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:13,988
# No doubt about it,
we'd be getting crazy #

278
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:16,365
# If one of us was lucky enough to be
born a lady #

279
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,270
# Unh, if one of us
was a lady #

280
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,570
# And I was your man,
if I was your man #

281
00:12:22,608 --> 00:12:24,576
# Well 'cause sometimes
it gets Ionely #

282
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,441
# And I nee-heed
a woman #

283
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:28,572
# And then I imagine
you with some bosoms #

284
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,447
# In fact one time
when we were touring #

285
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,509
# And I was really Ionely #

286
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,884
# And we were sharing
that twin room in the hotel #

287
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:38,253
# I put a wig on you
when you were sleeping #

288
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,691
# I put a wig on you...
you-hoo-hoo-hoo #

289
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:43,752
# And I just lay there
and spooned you #

290
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,821
# Oh, Bret,
you got it going on. #

291
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,398
So, hopefully that
made you feel better.

292
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,336
Can I please have
a look at the lyrics?

293
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,008
This is another one
of your weird songs, man.

294
00:12:58,043 --> 00:12:59,169
In what way?

295
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:00,701
What is that about,
"Sometimes I put a wig on you

296
00:13:00,746 --> 00:13:02,805
- when we're on tour"?
- Put a wig on you?

297
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:06,215
No. I didn't say
anything like that.

298
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:08,550
- Well, it's definitely a bit gay.
- What is?

299
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,987
Putting a wig on me
while I'm asleep.

300
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,218
I think sometimes you
hear what you want to hear.

301
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:17,320
It wouldn't be gay to put a wig on a man
and pretend they're a woman.

302
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:20,560
How could that be gay if you
were pretending they're a woman?

303
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:23,862
Not that I did it.

304
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:33,872
Bret? Bret?

305
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,540
Bret!

306
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,243
Hey, it's 1980
David Bowie,

307
00:13:38,284 --> 00:13:40,582
from the music video
"Ashes to Ashes."

308
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:43,213
- Hey, David Bowie.
- Did you try out the eye patch?

309
00:13:43,255 --> 00:13:45,519
Yeah, not so good.
Didn't work.

310
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:47,423
I lost my
depth perception.

311
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,791
- Oh no, did you?
- Yeah, I missed my chair.

312
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,195
- Oh God.
- Sat down and fell on the floor.

313
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:53,528
That's terrible.

314
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:55,431
And then I walked
into a door.

315
00:13:55,467 --> 00:13:57,367
Actually,
come to think of it,

316
00:13:57,403 --> 00:13:59,963
the same thing happened to me when
I wore an eye patch.

317
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,802
It was...
oh, it was always,

318
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,866
"Bowie's bumped
into a door."

319
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:05,740
- Hey, David Bowie?
- Yes, Bret?

320
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:07,837
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

321
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,075
Of course, Bret.
That's what I'm here for.

322
00:14:10,115 --> 00:14:13,016
Mm, if a friend of yours
puts a wig on you when he's Ionely,

323
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:15,350
pretends you're a woman,
is that gay?

324
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:19,346
He was pretending
you're a woman?

325
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,586
No, that's not gay.

326
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,787
Are you sure?

327
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:24,853
Totally fine.

328
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:26,421
Mm, okay.

329
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:28,194
Well, that's all.

330
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,997
Do you have any
other advice for me?

331
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,662
Yes.

332
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:36,073
It doesn't hurt to do something
absolutely outrageous.

333
00:14:36,108 --> 00:14:38,668
- Like what?
- Well, you'll know what to do, Bret.

334
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:42,579
And you'll know exactly
when the time is right.

335
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,215
I don't know, I just
don't like them anymore.

336
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,125
- Penguins are great...
- Oh hey, guys.

337
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:57,458
- Hey, Mel.
- Hi.

338
00:14:57,496 --> 00:14:59,623
Well, you're looking
good today, Bret.

339
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:01,496
- Very hot.
- Thank you.

340
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,057
Oh, that's nice
of Mel to say...

341
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:05,536
- Hotter than Jemaine.
- Oh, thanks, Mel.

342
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,129
- Mm-hmm.
- That's really kind.

343
00:15:07,172 --> 00:15:09,367
- Oh yeah.
- That's a nice compliment for you.

344
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,376
Yes, it is,
isn't it?

345
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,810
You have a refined
bone structure

346
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,144
whereas Jemaine's
facial features

347
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:19,014
are too deep-set to be
classically handsome.

348
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:20,916
- Thank you.
- Oh.

349
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:23,547
- You're a better singer too.
- Thanks, Mel.

350
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:26,752
Yeah, Jemaine's often flat,
but you are always on-key

351
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,419
every time I come
to your shows.

352
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,985
- Thank you.
- That's not... that's not true.

353
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,692
You're also really
really deep and passionate.

354
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,633
- You know, like, you think...
- Hey, Mel... don't you have to...

355
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,796
- That's really nice.
- I can see it in your lyrics.

356
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,031
- Hey!
- What?

357
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:43,303
- Shh, that's enough now.
- Oh, all right.

358
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,435
Well, I have a lot more
to say on that though.

359
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:47,069
No, I don't
think you do.

360
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:50,138
I think you probably
have to go somewhere now.

361
00:15:50,182 --> 00:15:51,581
- Thank you.
- Oh yes,

362
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,414
I do have to go
somewhere.

363
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,852
- It was great to see you, Mel.
- You too.

364
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:57,947
Oh God,
you're glowing today.

365
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,424
- You're glowing.
- Thanks, Mel, I appreciate it.

366
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,791
- See you later, bye.
- See you.

367
00:16:05,197 --> 00:16:07,028
What's her problem?

368
00:16:07,066 --> 00:16:09,034
- She was just being nice.
- Yeah well...

369
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:11,195
she went a bit far.

370
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,000
Do you think my facial features
are too deep-set

371
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:16,371
to be considered
classically handsome?

372
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:18,740
- That's what she said.
- I don't really know.

373
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:21,940
- Be honest.
- I've got no idea.

374
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:28,782
Bret, Bret,
uncross your legs.

375
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,584
Bret.

376
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:34,826
That's funky.

377
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,192
- I like that.
- Thank you, yes.

378
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:39,288
Yeah, that's a fun card.

379
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:41,128
Ah.

380
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,157
Where does the music
come from?

381
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:44,999
There's a small chip
and speaker set

382
00:16:45,037 --> 00:16:46,868
that goes into the back
of the card.

383
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:48,930
Is it a CD?

384
00:16:48,974 --> 00:16:52,000
No, it's more like a...

385
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,103
a chip and speaker set
that we...

386
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:56,614
it's very small and it's
about the size of your thumbnail

387
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,980
and we just put it right
inside the back of the card.

388
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,542
Like headphones?

389
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,747
No, this is
a computer chip

390
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:06,053
that's devoted really
to one function only...

391
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,492
the playing of the song
when we open the card...

392
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:11,996
and then, I guess you could
say its second function

393
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,591
is turning off
at this point.

394
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:16,624
Like a Walkman.

395
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:19,193
No it's not...
not like a Walkman at all.

396
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,496
Good.

397
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,374
- Um, Mr. Armstrong?
- Please call me David.

398
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:26,901
- Okay, David.
- Thank you.

399
00:17:26,945 --> 00:17:31,609
Um, David, when will
this meeting actually begin?

400
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,777
Well it's, um...
it has begun.

401
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,411
They didn't do
a roll call.

402
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:37,217
You know, I believe
in potential.

403
00:17:37,256 --> 00:17:40,589
It's hard to define,
but I know it when I see it,

404
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,423
and I see it
in you guys.

405
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,929
Thank you, David.
I know what you mean.

406
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,124
Good.
We love the track.

407
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:49,396
We'd like to include it
in a card we're working on.

408
00:17:49,435 --> 00:17:52,268
It's a kind of futuristic
birthday card.

409
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,034
Wow, yes,
that'd be great.

410
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,305
And we're going to pay you
1¢ per card.

411
00:17:58,343 --> 00:18:01,312
How many cards would you
look at manufacturing, David?

412
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,644
Depending on demand,
we might make as many as...

413
00:18:03,682 --> 00:18:06,674
- half a million.
- Woah... we're talking serious money.

414
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:08,845
Yes, we're talking
serious money,

415
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:11,481
and a lot of it too,
if we can work together.

416
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:14,515
I mean, I really need to know these
guys. What are they all about?

417
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:17,085
Yep, okay.
Well, Bret,

418
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,063
talk about yourself.

419
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,430
Oh well, um...
I'm... I'm Bret.

420
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:22,866
Yeah?

421
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:26,065
- What else?
- You're the smaller one.

422
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,663
He's the smaller one
of the two.

423
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,573
He's... you're
into animals.

424
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,543
Um, you were
bulimic recently.

425
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:35,046
- I wasn't... I wasn't bulimic.
- He's not now, he's fine now.

426
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,945
- I'm not bulimic.
- Little touch of that.

427
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,813
- I wasn't bulimic.
- It's cleared up.

428
00:18:38,851 --> 00:18:41,081
And, Jemaine,
he's the ladies' man.

429
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,485
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

430
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,011
You said the girls
like you.

431
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:46,820
I've lost confidence now.
Completely lost confidence.

432
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,419
He's just acting depressed 'cause he
thinks it's cool.

433
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,292
I'm gonna interrupt
you now, for a moment,

434
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,025
because it seems to me
that maybe...

435
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,499
you're not that interested
in having one of your songs

436
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,229
appear in our
greeting card, so...

437
00:18:57,269 --> 00:19:00,102
We are interested, and I'm really sorry
about these guys.

438
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,403
I hope they haven't
stuffed the whole thing up.

439
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:03,931
It's just that,
you know...

440
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:05,944
You'll know what to do, Bret.

441
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,276
And you'll know exactly
when the time is right.

442
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:10,873
Today they've just got
a different sort of...

443
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:14,010
Whoo-hoo! Whoo!

444
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,451
Waha!

445
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:18,652
Bret, what on earth was that?

446
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,523
I can't believe it.
It's outrageous.

447
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,290
Absolutely outrageous.
What were you thinking?

448
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,991
- I thought it would help.
- You thought that would help?

449
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:28,761
Oh my gosh.

450
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,768
That's illegal,
you know?

451
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:32,667
How could you do it?

452
00:19:32,704 --> 00:19:34,968
I thought it would
make us more memorable.

453
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,568
Were there supposed to be
lightning bolts on the side of it?

454
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,305
- Yeah, looked pretty good, eh?
- Mm.

455
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:42,336
What are you talking about?
It didn't work.

456
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,212
The whole thing
was stupid!

457
00:19:44,249 --> 00:19:46,149
Well, it wasn't my idea,
Murray.

458
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,346
David Bowie told me
to do it in a dream.

459
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,821
Oh yeah, right, Bret.
David Bowie in a dream.

460
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,687
- Yes.
- What are you talking about?

461
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:56,182
That's typical of you.
Major money.

462
00:19:56,228 --> 00:19:58,321
Something else
will come up.

463
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,557
I don't know.

464
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:02,829
Maybe I'm not cut out
for band management.

465
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,495
It's not you, Murray.
You're good.

466
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:07,630
I think it's my fault.
That's all I'm saying.

467
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:10,642
If I was a better manager,
I could have changed this

468
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:12,906
or turned it
into something positive.

469
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,209
I could have stopped you
before you revealed it,

470
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:17,044
or turned it into
some sort of thing,

471
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,210
like I could have said it was a cultural
New Zealand greeting.

472
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,981
You know, we could
have all done it.

473
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,716
But I'm just not
quick enough on my feet.

474
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:28,055
Something else
will turn up.

475
00:20:32,097 --> 00:20:34,691
Bret, Bret?

476
00:20:39,104 --> 00:20:40,696
Bret!

477
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,197
It's 1986 David Bowie
from the movie "Labyrinth."

478
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,767
Yeah, I know.

479
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:49,611
So you showed your penis to the man
from the greeting-card company?

480
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,208
- That was your idea.
- I didn't mean something like that.

481
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,980
I only meant
something like...

482
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,714
I don't know,
wear makeup or...

483
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,019
I was wearing makeup.
I had lightning bolts on my wanger.

484
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:01,651
I meant on your face, Bret.
On your face.

485
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:03,627
So have you got
any more advice?

486
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,254
No, I don't have
any more advice.

487
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,925
I've given you
all of my good advice.

488
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:11,428
Actually, I've totally
lost confidence

489
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,803
in my ability to help people.
I'm useless.

490
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,673
Jemaine actually thinks that maybe
you're a figment of my imagination.

491
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:22,274
I might as well be, Bret.
I might as well be.

492
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:24,282
- Yeah.
- Anyway, Bret,

493
00:21:24,316 --> 00:21:27,444
- I have to go.
- Where are you going?

494
00:21:27,486 --> 00:21:29,886
I'm going to a party.
I'm already 20 minutes late.

495
00:21:29,921 --> 00:21:31,889
Sounds cool.
Where's the party?

496
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:34,983
In space, Bret.
In space.

497
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:36,494
- Space?
- Yeah.

498
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:39,691
It is quite freaky,
isn't it, Bret?

499
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,722
Yeah... no.

500
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:47,331
- Goodbye, Bret.
- See you, Bowie.

501
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:07,483
# Bowie's in space #

502
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:14,698
# Bowie's in space #

503
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,930
# What you doin'
out there, man? #

504
00:22:17,969 --> 00:22:20,597
# That's pretty freaky,
Bowie #

505
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,199
# Isn't it cold
out in space, Bowie? #

506
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:28,045
# Do you want to borrow
my jumper, Bowie? #

507
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,915
# Does the space cold make your
nipples go pointy, Bowie? #

508
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,881
# Do you use your
pointy nipples #

509
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:40,722
# As telescopic antennae
to transmit data back to Earth? #

510
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:43,853
# Bet you do,
you freaky old bastard, you #

511
00:22:43,895 --> 00:22:48,832
# Hey, Bowie? Do you have one really
funky sequined space suit #

512
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:52,394
# Or do you have several
ch-changes? #

513
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,702
# Do you smoke grass
out in space, Bowie? #

514
00:22:55,741 --> 00:22:57,038
# Or do they smoke... #

515
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,940
# AstroTurf? #

516
00:22:58,977 --> 00:23:00,877
# Oooh #

517
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,210
# Receiving transmission #

518
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:06,012
# From David Bowie's
nipple antennae #

519
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:10,249
# Do you read me,
Lieutenant Bowie? #

520
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,692
# This is Bowie to Bowie #

521
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,496
# Do you hear me
out there, man? #

522
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,695
# This is Bowie
back to Bowie #

523
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:27,364
# I read you
loud and clear, man #

524
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,704
# Hoo yeah, man #

525
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:33,268
# Your signal's weak
on my radar screen #

526
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,176
# How far out
are you, man? #

527
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,680
# I'm pretty far out #

528
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,047
# That's pretty
far out, man #

529
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:42,149
# Ooh ooh ooh hoo #

530
00:23:42,187 --> 00:23:45,679
# I'm orbiting Pluto #

531
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:48,625
# Ooh ah ooh-hoo #

532
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,561
# Drawn in by its
"groovatational" #

533
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,861
# Groovatational pull #

534
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,892
# I'm jamming out
with the Mick Jaggernauts #

535
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:03,636
# So and I think
it's pretty cool, man #

536
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,576
# Oh-ah! #

537
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,476
# Are you okay, Bowie? #

538
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,174
# What was that sound? #

539
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:13,844
# I don't know, man,
I have to turn my ship around #

540
00:24:13,885 --> 00:24:16,877
# Ooh, it's
the craziest thing #

541
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:20,881
# Yeah, I'm picking it up
on my L.S.D. Screen #

542
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:26,228
# Can you see
the stratosphere ringing? #

543
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:28,755
# To the choir #

544
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:33,100
# of "Afronauts" singing #

545
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,834
# Bowie's in... #

546
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:38,707
# Space. #

547
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:49,785
So I'm guessing like,
if David Bowie isn't that confident,

548
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,813
then maybe... maybe most people
aren't that confident?

549
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,759
Which means... I'm not gonna worry
about being confident.

550
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:58,490
Yeah, we don't need to worry about
being confident.

551
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,521
- Yeah...
- But it's not really him though.

552
00:25:00,565 --> 00:25:01,691
- I know...
- It's a dream.

553
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,428
- I know but...
- It's your dream.

554
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:06,096
I know it's my dream but you'd
still think he'd be more confident.

555
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,105
Yeah, can I have
your biscuit, Bret?

556
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:10,767
Help yourself. I'm not eating anymore.
I'm a bit too fat.

557
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,107
- Hey, Murray.
- Hey guys, guess what's in my hand.

558
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,839
- Um...
- A biscuit?

559
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,347
No, not even close.

560
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:20,249
- Jemaine?
- Another kind of biscuit?

561
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,219
No, I haven't got
a biscuit, have I?

562
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:24,814
I said no biscuit. It's not gonna be
another kind, is it?

563
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,381
- Is it a really big biscuit?
- It's not a biscuit!

564
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:29,620
I don't know, you know
I'm not very imaginative.

565
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,822
You've ruined this game.
I'll just show you.

566
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:35,062
Ah, that's flippin' awesome.

567
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,398
Listen.

568
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:40,233
- Listen to that.
- But I thought they weren't gonna?

569
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:42,399
No, Mr. Armstrong said
he admired Bret's balls.

570
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,068
He thought we'd like to see
the prototype of the new card.

571
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,876
So can I get you a drink?
I think we can afford it.

572
00:25:48,914 --> 00:25:51,747
Are they printing
half a million cards?

573
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:54,616
No, they're only making 50. It's not
a very popular design.

574
00:25:54,653 --> 00:25:58,111
But we've got 50¢,
so how much are your coffees?

575
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,386
- 60¢.
- Can I get a copy of that, Murray?

576
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:02,552
No no, 'cause that would
cost more than 50¢,

577
00:26:02,594 --> 00:26:05,825
and then we'd... we'd be down, wouldn't
we? The whole thing would be a waste.

578
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:07,331
Can I borrow it
for a bit?

579
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:10,095
You can have it for one night,
but don't send it to anyone.

580
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,693
How do they get
the music in there?

581
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,136
It's very technical. Did you hear
what he was talking about?

582
00:26:14,172 --> 00:26:16,299
It's a computer chip
with a speaker attached.

583
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:19,367
- There's a thing in there.
- Pretty much like a Walkman.
