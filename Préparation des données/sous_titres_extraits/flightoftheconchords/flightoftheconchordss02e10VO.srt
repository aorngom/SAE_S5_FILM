1
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,637
Uh...

2
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:08,184
<i>we're being way too loud?</i>

3
00:02:08,252 --> 00:02:09,920
Yes, but this is
regarding the rent.

4
00:02:09,987 --> 00:02:13,623
- Oh, we've paid our rent.
- We've paid our rent.

5
00:02:13,724 --> 00:02:16,059
- You gave me a check.
- We gave you that check.

6
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:18,228
- Yeah.
- Yeah, but I've been collecting the checks

7
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,897
and I just went
to the bank to deposit them

8
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:23,300
and they're
in the wrong currency.

9
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:26,770
- What?
- They're in new zealand dollars.

10
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:28,572
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, they're probably...

11
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:31,174
- yeah, our checkbook is...
- it's a new zealand account.

12
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:34,477
- New zealand account.
- Yeah, I need you to pay rent in American dollars.

13
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:37,480
- Okay.
- Retroactively...

14
00:02:37,548 --> 00:02:39,482
and future actively.

15
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:41,218
Well, we can't do
anything in the past.

16
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:44,654
No, but you could pay me now
for the mistakes of the past.

17
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:47,824
<i>- Yeah.
- How much do we owe?</i>

18
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:50,227
Over the past two years,
you've come up short

19
00:02:50,294 --> 00:02:54,598
and you owe me $7,727.

20
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:01,004
- Yeah.
- Is that American dollars or real dollars?

21
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:04,608
- American. - that...
we owe you that much?

22
00:03:04,675 --> 00:03:07,911
- Yeah, and for new zealand
dollars, you would owe...

23
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,779
...that much.

24
00:03:09,847 --> 00:03:12,082
Yeah.

25
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:16,019
- $77,000.
- Yeah. Yeah.

26
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:19,356
- Can we give you an I.o. U?
- No. No.

27
00:03:19,457 --> 00:03:22,292
<i>- In American dollars, not in new zealand dollars.
- Oh, no.</i>

28
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,861
<i>- No, I'm gonna need... I prefer the money.
- The money.</i>

29
00:03:24,929 --> 00:03:26,396
- Yeah.
- Soon?

30
00:03:26,464 --> 00:03:28,498
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Let me handle this, Bret.

31
00:03:28,566 --> 00:03:31,401
- Can I be honest with you?
- Yes.

32
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:33,737
<i>We don't have any...
anywhere near</i>

33
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:35,772
that amount of money.

34
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,675
When do you think you will
have that amount of money?

35
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:40,510
- May I?
- Yes.

36
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,414
Okay, here...
here it is. Umm...

37
00:03:44,482 --> 00:03:46,850
- whoa.
- Ooh.

38
00:03:46,918 --> 00:03:50,053
- Never.
- I'm going to give you a month.

39
00:03:50,154 --> 00:03:52,389
You have a month to pay your
rent, otherwise you have to leave.

40
00:03:52,456 --> 00:03:54,391
- Well... - can we
choose which month?

41
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,359
No.

42
00:03:58,429 --> 00:04:00,597
- Evicted?
- Mmm.

43
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:03,366
- By whose authority?
- The landlord.

44
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:05,368
- Why?
- Just because we were paying

45
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:07,571
with new zealand dollars
instead of American dollars.

46
00:04:07,672 --> 00:04:10,173
Okay, so he's a racist
and now you're homeless.

47
00:04:10,241 --> 00:04:13,176
- Yeah, it's really terrible.
- Oh, Bret.

48
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:15,579
- Present.
- Jemaine.

49
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:18,615
- Present.
- Well, Murray, present.

50
00:04:20,685 --> 00:04:22,619
I think
it might be time, guys.

51
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:25,488
- What for?
- To stage your lives

52
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:27,257
as an off-broadway musical.

53
00:04:27,325 --> 00:04:28,959
- Oh.
- Oh, yeah, of course.

54
00:04:29,026 --> 00:04:31,027
Is there a more
practical solution?

55
00:04:31,095 --> 00:04:32,796
- No, just... - one that
relates to our problem?

56
00:04:32,864 --> 00:04:34,731
Look at this.

57
00:04:34,799 --> 00:04:36,266
It's time
to show you, okay?

58
00:04:36,334 --> 00:04:37,901
I've been writing this
for two years...

59
00:04:37,969 --> 00:04:39,936
secretly, all right?

60
00:04:40,004 --> 00:04:41,571
It's a musical,
like "mamma mia"...

61
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:44,341
<i>- "mamma mia"?
...but this is your musical.</i>

62
00:04:44,408 --> 00:04:45,609
All right?
It's your story.

63
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,879
- A musical?
- Yeah, about your lives.

64
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:50,714
We haven't got anywhere
to live, and you're saying

65
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:53,049
we should put on... maybe
we should put on a musical?

66
00:04:53,117 --> 00:04:55,352
I think so. The opportunity has arisen

67
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,854
to present this
to you, okay?

68
00:04:57,922 --> 00:05:00,524
It's about a couple of
deadbeat guys from new zealand

69
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:03,226
- who have got nothing going on.
- Wait, who are those characters?

70
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:06,096
Jemaine and Bret.
It's... it's based on you,

71
00:05:06,163 --> 00:05:08,798
- and you come to America with a dream.
- How insulting.

72
00:05:08,866 --> 00:05:11,401
- It says "two hopeless losers."
- Yup, that's you.

73
00:05:11,469 --> 00:05:14,471
You're down and out. At the
beginning you've got nothing

74
00:05:14,539 --> 00:05:18,008
and you start at the bottom,
but with a bit of hard work

75
00:05:18,075 --> 00:05:21,077
and the help of a savvy manager
who shows you the light...

76
00:05:21,145 --> 00:05:23,313
- who's that?
- Oh, that's a character

77
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,081
who's based on me,
loosely based on me...

78
00:05:25,149 --> 00:05:26,316
you make it to the top.

79
00:05:26,384 --> 00:05:28,985
Our story is
the story of two guys

80
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:31,888
who start at the bottom
and with a lot of hard work

81
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,557
continue along
the bottom

82
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,258
and finally end up
at the bottom.

83
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:37,093
Oh yeah, that's
an intriguing scenario.

84
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:39,329
- Yeah, it's a rags- to-rags
story. - Yeah, imagine it.

85
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,665
Yeah, did you see the one about
the guys who started at the bottom,

86
00:05:41,732 --> 00:05:44,134
stayed at the bottom and at the
end they were still at the bottom?

87
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:46,970
- Oh. Yes, that's our lives.
- So inspirational.

88
00:05:47,038 --> 00:05:49,573
- Who'd go and see that?
- L... I think I'd see that.

89
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,441
- I would go see that.
- It's more realistic.

90
00:05:51,509 --> 00:05:54,177
You're thinking that you're
at the end of your tether now,

91
00:05:54,278 --> 00:05:56,112
but what if this is just
the beginning of your story?

92
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,014
Then it's a slow start,
isn't it?

93
00:05:58,082 --> 00:05:59,749
This is
good stuff, okay?

94
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,352
I was writing this and at the
same time I was reading it.

95
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,954
I couldn't put it down.

96
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:06,223
- Take a look at the end.
- What happens at the end?

97
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,559
At the end you end up staging
yourselves a big broadway musical

98
00:06:09,627 --> 00:06:12,729
- and it's a great success.
- Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's gonna happen like that.

99
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:16,333
Well, everything so far
has turned out, Bret, okay?

100
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,301
Yeah, but that's because it's
based on truth... this is our story...

101
00:06:18,369 --> 00:06:20,170
and then you just made up
the end with a musical.

102
00:06:20,238 --> 00:06:22,372
Some of it's in the future.
But look at this scene.

103
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,341
Iook, you come
into my office

104
00:06:24,375 --> 00:06:27,043
and I tell you about the musical
I've written. It's just like now.

105
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,378
- Really?
- Yeah.

106
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,213
- Oh yeah, you say "really?"
- There you go.

107
00:06:30,281 --> 00:06:32,349
You've got "really?" here.
I knew you'd say that.

108
00:06:32,416 --> 00:06:35,318
- The thing is... - oh,
we're supposed to be singing.

109
00:06:35,386 --> 00:06:38,021
Yeah, when I tell you the
news, and here you love it

110
00:06:38,055 --> 00:06:39,890
and you get up on your
chairs and sing, but...

111
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:42,225
- that's not gonna happen.
- Trust me, guys,

112
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:45,495
this is gonna be great.
This is our last resort.

113
00:06:45,563 --> 00:06:47,898
It sure is.

114
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,566
Can we stay at your place
tonight, Murray?

115
00:06:49,634 --> 00:06:51,902
Yeah, sure,

116
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:54,137
but I've
only got one bed

117
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:57,974
and I grope people
in my sleep.

118
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,709
It's a condition.

119
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,411
It's one of the reasons

120
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:03,146
I had to leave
the new zealand army.

121
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,448
We'll just stay
on the co... on the floor.

122
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:07,417
I'll probably
find you there.

123
00:07:07,485 --> 00:07:10,220
I tend to...
I really reach out.

124
00:07:10,288 --> 00:07:13,690
- I'll sleep in the kitchen.
- Mmm, okay.

125
00:07:15,526 --> 00:07:17,093
Mmm, never mind.

126
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:19,029
- No?
- We'll find somewhere.

127
00:07:19,096 --> 00:07:20,564
Yeah, don't worry
about it.

128
00:07:20,598 --> 00:07:22,999
That's actually better for
the story, if you're homeless.

129
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:27,771
"Two homeless deadbeats
go out onto the streets."

130
00:07:27,838 --> 00:07:30,807
Wow, this is
great stuff.

131
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:36,746
I'm sorry I can't
help you guys out,

132
00:07:36,781 --> 00:07:40,550
but I think the other guy living in my
apartment is a dangerous drug dealer.

133
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:42,886
<i>- Your dad?
- Yeah.</i>

134
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:45,889
I can't have you at my apartment.
What if some crazy shit goes down?

135
00:07:45,957 --> 00:07:49,426
- Yeah.
- And I'm not allowed to have friends over on weeknights,

136
00:07:49,493 --> 00:07:53,163
- but this place is good.
- Hey, guys.

137
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:54,931
Hi, we'd like
to inquire about a room.

138
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:56,833
Mm-hmm, sure.

139
00:07:56,901 --> 00:07:59,469
But we only have
$51 American.

140
00:07:59,537 --> 00:08:03,039
We only have one room
that you can get for $51...

141
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:05,809
- room 204.
- That sounds good.

142
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:09,179
Well, the thing about room 204 is
that a terrible murder happened there...

143
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:11,281
a woman killed
her husband.

144
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:13,083
It was the most gruesome
thing I ever heard of.

145
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,618
What do you mean?
What... what happened?

146
00:08:14,685 --> 00:08:16,953
She decapitated him,

147
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:19,256
castrated him,
defanged him.

148
00:08:19,323 --> 00:08:21,625
She removed
his hands and feet.

149
00:08:21,692 --> 00:08:23,994
- Right.
- I'll always remember the day

150
00:08:24,095 --> 00:08:27,497
of that most horrible
murder... the 1St of november.

151
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:29,599
- Oh, that's today's date.
- Weird.

152
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:31,768
Yeah, it's today's date.
It happened earlier today.

153
00:08:31,836 --> 00:08:33,303
<i>- Eh?
- Shit.</i>

154
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:34,938
And the police
psychologist said

155
00:08:35,006 --> 00:08:36,473
she would return
to the scene...

156
00:08:36,507 --> 00:08:38,108
to kill again.

157
00:08:38,175 --> 00:08:39,676
- Hey, guys.
- Oh! Shit.

158
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:41,177
- Hey, Mel.
- Where's Doug?

159
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,346
- Oh, he's just there.
- Hey, guys.

160
00:08:43,414 --> 00:08:45,015
<i>- Oh! Shit.
- Hey.</i>

161
00:08:45,082 --> 00:08:48,351
I heard you don't have
a place to stay.

162
00:08:48,452 --> 00:08:50,487
- Yeah.
- I would love it

163
00:08:50,521 --> 00:08:52,656
if you'd stay with us.

164
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:54,591
Oh, we're okay.
We just got a room.

165
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:56,459
Oh.

166
00:08:59,430 --> 00:09:01,097
Thanks for the offer,
though.

167
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,699
Yeah.

168
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:04,534
Hmm.

169
00:09:04,602 --> 00:09:06,102
Actually, maybe that
would be quite good.

170
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,871
Thank u, Mel.
Thank you, Doug.

171
00:09:07,939 --> 00:09:11,041
- Of course!
- Eh?

172
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:16,012
Okay, so another rule:

173
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,181
There will be no bringing
girls back to the house.

174
00:09:18,249 --> 00:09:21,151
I know how
you guys are.

175
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:23,019
Actually, Mel,
I don't see any reason

176
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:25,488
why they can't bring girls
back here to visit if they want.

177
00:09:25,556 --> 00:09:28,658
Uh, do you want to bring
some girls home too, Doug?

178
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:31,695
- No, but I don't see any reason why they can't.
- No, that's fine.

179
00:09:31,729 --> 00:09:33,563
Yeah, maybe I'll bring
some girls home too,

180
00:09:33,631 --> 00:09:35,565
<i>just find some
real authentic sluts</i>

181
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:38,635
and just turn this house
into a whorehome.

182
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:41,504
- Is that what you'd like,
Doug? - No, it's not, but...

183
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:44,574
there will be no smoking,
drinking or drugs, no partying.

184
00:09:44,642 --> 00:09:47,477
- We don't party.
- I know, that's for Doug.

185
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,847
Ahem. He struggled
with addiction.

186
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:53,783
Okay, number 8:

187
00:09:53,851 --> 00:09:56,319
You must not leave
the house.

188
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:58,755
- When?
- What, never?

189
00:09:58,823 --> 00:10:00,757
Well, not after 11:30 P.M.

190
00:10:00,825 --> 00:10:04,094
And preferably never.

191
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:06,530
<i>Umm, I think that's...</i>

192
00:10:06,597 --> 00:10:09,966
so other than those rules,
there are no rules.

193
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:12,369
Now before we turn in,
I would just love it

194
00:10:12,436 --> 00:10:14,938
if you guys could play
a song for me.

195
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:18,742
The thing is
Bret is overtired

196
00:10:18,809 --> 00:10:21,878
and there's a risk
of throat polyps.

197
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:23,547
- Oh.
- What are they?

198
00:10:23,614 --> 00:10:26,516
Why don't I play a little
something for all of us on the harp?

199
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:30,287
Oh, Doug! No.

200
00:10:30,354 --> 00:10:31,988
That is such
a womanly instrument.

201
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:34,324
Have you ever heard
of a man playing a harp?

202
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:36,393
- My dad plays the harp.
- I've never heard...

203
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,295
I've never seen
a man play a harp.

204
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,067
There you go, Bret...

205
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:46,736
- nice and tucked in.
- Thank you, Mel.

206
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:49,306
- Keep you... - it's very
tight. I can't really move.

207
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:52,809
- Okay, sweet dreams.
- Thank you.

208
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:55,812
Mel, I was wondering if we
could have the heat turned down.

209
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,480
- It's quite hot in here.
- Yes, very hot.

210
00:10:57,548 --> 00:11:00,483
- Oh, the heater's broken.
- But I saw you turning it...

211
00:11:00,585 --> 00:11:02,986
yocould always push
these back a little bit.

212
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:06,456
- That's okay.
- Okay.

213
00:11:06,524 --> 00:11:11,094
Okay. Well, I am
going to lock the door

214
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:14,598
- for security, so... - would
you be able to leave that open?

215
00:11:14,665 --> 00:11:17,801
No, it's a very
dangerous neighborhood.

216
00:11:17,869 --> 00:11:20,270
I sometimes go to the toilet
in the middle of the night.

217
00:11:20,338 --> 00:11:22,305
Mm-hmm. I know.

218
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:24,341
You guys are so cute.

219
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:25,942
I could just eat you up.

220
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,644
Good night.

221
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:57,874
¶ petrov,
yelyena and me ¶

222
00:11:57,942 --> 00:12:01,311
¶ lost but happy at sea ¶

223
00:12:01,379 --> 00:12:04,281
¶ petrov and yelyena
said to me... ¶

224
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:07,450
shouldn't we
have something to eat?

225
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:11,288
¶ I say there are plenty
of fish in the sea ¶

226
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:14,424
¶ but all
they can see is me ¶

227
00:12:14,492 --> 00:12:17,594
- ¶ they said... ¶
- any last requests?

228
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:21,131
¶ biding my time,
I said, "yes ¶

229
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:24,568
¶ I want to party,
just we three ¶

230
00:12:24,635 --> 00:12:27,904
¶ lost but happy
at sea" ¶

231
00:12:29,473 --> 00:12:32,375
¶ so we drank all night
from the keg ¶

232
00:12:32,443 --> 00:12:36,479
¶ I passed out and I woke
with one leg, I said... ¶

233
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:39,683
"petrov, have you seen
my leg?" ¶ he said... ¶

234
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:42,452
- no.
- ¶ and he went back to bed ¶

235
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,689
¶ but he looked
suspiciously well-fed ¶

236
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:49,626
¶ three days later,
they're hungry again ¶

237
00:12:49,694 --> 00:12:53,430
- ¶ they said... ¶
- any last requests, my friend, again?

238
00:12:53,497 --> 00:12:57,000
So I said, "do you know
any rolling stones?"

239
00:12:57,068 --> 00:13:00,537
It was a hilarious moment in a
very bleak bleak time of my life.

240
00:13:00,605 --> 00:13:04,341
¶ so we danced all night
to the rolling stones ¶

241
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,644
¶ when I awoke,
they were chewing on bones ¶

242
00:13:07,712 --> 00:13:10,714
¶ yelyena was supping blood
from a cup... ¶

243
00:13:10,781 --> 00:13:13,383
that's when I knew
that something was up.

244
00:13:13,451 --> 00:13:16,119
Hey, petrov, what is
that you are eating?

245
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:18,622
- It's fish.
- How come it looks so much like my arm

246
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,624
which has been hacked off
at the elbow last night?

247
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:22,626
Oh, it's an arm fish.

248
00:13:22,693 --> 00:13:25,929
¶ later that night,
while they were asleep ¶

249
00:13:25,997 --> 00:13:29,232
¶ I swallowed some arsenic
to poison my meat ¶

250
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:32,569
¶ I was very ill,
but revenge is so sweet ¶

251
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:36,306
¶ unlike the last meal
my comrades would eat ¶

252
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:47,450
¶ when I awoke,
they were already dead ¶

253
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:50,720
¶ all that was left
of me was my head ¶

254
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:54,124
¶ no, not dead,
just a head ¶

255
00:13:54,158 --> 00:13:58,328
¶ lost but so lonely ¶

256
00:13:58,396 --> 00:14:01,965
¶ at sea. ¶

257
00:14:08,506 --> 00:14:11,174
okay, now in this scene

258
00:14:11,242 --> 00:14:13,109
you're back in new zealand,
you're on your farm,

259
00:14:13,177 --> 00:14:15,011
you're frustrated
with your uncle and auntie

260
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,514
<i>because they won't let you go
into town to play your music.</i>

261
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:20,083
Ready? Go.

262
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:22,185
"I just want to play guitar
with my friends."

263
00:14:22,253 --> 00:14:24,487
We need you back
on the farm, Bret,

264
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:27,524
- just for one more season.
- But that's a whole another year away.

265
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,259
Listen to your uncle, Bret!

266
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:31,828
Murray, who's she?

267
00:14:31,863 --> 00:14:33,930
Don't look at me.
I'm not here, Bret.

268
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:36,466
You're in your world, okay?

269
00:14:36,534 --> 00:14:38,735
- Where'd you get this stuff from?
- You're talking to me now?

270
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:41,371
Just... if we... can we stop
rehearsal for a second?

271
00:14:41,472 --> 00:14:43,139
Stop there.
Okay, stop there.

272
00:14:43,207 --> 00:14:46,343
This seems very similar
to "star wars."

273
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,379
I've mixed you up with...
what's his name?

274
00:14:49,447 --> 00:14:51,514
- Luke skywalker.
...luke skywalker.

275
00:14:51,582 --> 00:14:53,416
Damn it.

276
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:57,053
- Yeah.
- Sorry, guys, you won't be needed for this scene.

277
00:14:57,121 --> 00:14:59,656
So you've got a dad and a mom
instead of an auntie and uncle.

278
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:01,825
<i>- Other than that it's the same.
- So the house is the same?</i>

279
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:05,061
- This still looks... -
houses look kind of different.

280
00:15:05,129 --> 00:15:08,632
- You were a farmer, though, weren't you?
- No, I was never a farmer.

281
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,500
<i>- You weren't?
- Who told you I was a farmer?</i>

282
00:15:10,568 --> 00:15:12,636
- I thought you were a farmer...
- never ever a farmer.

283
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,172
...back in new zealand.
- No, not at all. I was a shepherd.

284
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,642
- A shepherd?
- He was ahepherd, not a farmer.

285
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,411
- Oh, here's me... - I can't
imagine this guy farming.

286
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:24,114
- I wouldn't know what to do.
- I don't know where I got that idea.

287
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:25,982
And what about you?
You're a farmer.

288
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,717
- No, I was a shepherd too.
- Yeah, Jemaine's a shepherd.

289
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:29,286
- Both shepherds?
- We were both shepherds.

290
00:15:29,353 --> 00:15:31,388
- That's how we know each other.
- We met each other one time

291
00:15:31,422 --> 00:15:33,657
when Jemaine lost a couple
of his sheep and I found them.

292
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:36,259
They had wandered over
to Bret's paddock.

293
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:39,596
What about the wise old guy
that you had to find

294
00:15:39,697 --> 00:15:41,431
and then he taught you
to fight your father?

295
00:15:41,532 --> 00:15:42,866
I think
that's "star wars."

296
00:15:42,934 --> 00:15:44,701
All right,
scratch that character.

297
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,640
Yeah, no, we won't
be needing that, greg.

298
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:52,943
<i>Thanks, though.</i>

299
00:15:57,315 --> 00:15:59,115
We need to talk.

300
00:15:59,183 --> 00:16:01,284
We had to leave
because we had rehearsal,

301
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:03,119
<i>- and we snuck out.
- It's not that. It's not that.</i>

302
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:05,422
We had to be there
by 2:30, so...

303
00:16:05,489 --> 00:16:08,925
Doug and I have something very
important to talk to you about.

304
00:16:08,993 --> 00:16:13,496
We have decided
to spend some time apart.

305
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:15,065
- What?
- Oh.

306
00:16:15,132 --> 00:16:17,901
And I know this is
gonna be hard on you two,

307
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:20,604
okay, but we want you to
know that we both love you

308
00:16:20,671 --> 00:16:23,740
very very very
very very much.

309
00:16:23,808 --> 00:16:25,275
But where will
we live?

310
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,777
Well, just because
Doug and I don't wanna

311
00:16:27,845 --> 00:16:31,915
be together anymore doesn't mean
that we don't want to be with you.

312
00:16:31,983 --> 00:16:36,753
- This isn't about you.
- Well, actually, Mel, it is about them.

313
00:16:36,821 --> 00:16:39,890
Do not say that in front of
them, Doug. It's damaging.

314
00:16:41,492 --> 00:16:43,093
Now we've talked about it

315
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:45,629
and we've decided that,

316
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:49,099
Bret, you will
stay with me

317
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:52,068
and, Jemaine,
you will stay with Doug.

318
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,304
But I will
fight you, Doug,

319
00:16:54,372 --> 00:16:55,772
and I will
get you back, Jemaine.

320
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,208
Why can't we all
just stay together?

321
00:16:58,276 --> 00:17:02,379
Oh, Bret, you'll understand
when you're older, okay?

322
00:17:02,446 --> 00:17:05,949
- You're so young.
- I'm 32.

323
00:17:06,017 --> 00:17:09,719
Now, Jemaine, don't worry.
You'll still see a lot of me.

324
00:17:09,787 --> 00:17:12,589
Mmm, um, yeah, probably.

325
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,624
And Bret, you can
still see Doug.

326
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:16,660
- Mel...
- mm-hmm.

327
00:17:16,727 --> 00:17:19,629
...are you wearing
my shirt?

328
00:17:19,697 --> 00:17:22,165
Yes, I am.

329
00:18:11,849 --> 00:18:14,718
Okay, cast meeting.
Bret as Bret.

330
00:18:14,785 --> 00:18:16,786
- Yup.
- Jemaine as Jemaine.

331
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:18,755
- Yes.
- Writer, director, producer

332
00:18:18,823 --> 00:18:20,891
<i>Murray hewitt present.</i>

333
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:22,659
- Oh, hello, greg. That looks good.
- Hey.

334
00:18:22,727 --> 00:18:24,628
- Sheep.
- Good one.

335
00:18:24,695 --> 00:18:27,864
All right, now we've got some
industry types in tonight,

336
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:29,933
- so just be aware of that.
- Recording industry?

337
00:18:30,001 --> 00:18:32,402
No, the embassy industry.

338
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:34,437
What, some of your mates
from embassies?

339
00:18:34,505 --> 00:18:36,406
Yeah, different embassies.

340
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,442
Right, "lines." okay, how are
you going to know your lines?

341
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:41,511
- Well, we've memorized them.
- Yeah, memorized them.

342
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:44,381
- Who told you to do that?
- I thought that's what you were supposed to do.

343
00:18:44,448 --> 00:18:45,916
No, you've gotta write
your lines down.

344
00:18:45,983 --> 00:18:48,218
- Where are we gonna write them?
- All the professional actors

345
00:18:48,286 --> 00:18:50,020
write their lines down
on each other's clothing.

346
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:52,088
- Do they?
- Yes, of course they do.

347
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:53,957
- Really?
- If you get stuck on a line,

348
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:56,393
you go in like this.
"Oh yeah, that's right."

349
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,461
"Yes, we're supposed
to go there."

350
00:18:58,529 --> 00:19:00,463
We've got
300 pages of lines.

351
00:19:00,531 --> 00:19:02,732
The longer the play,
the bigger the shirt.

352
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,902
You'll always notice that... big
costumes. Why do they always go like this?

353
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,804
There's lines covered
in all the clothing.

354
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:09,773
- Well, we've memorized it, so we don't need it.
- Okay. I know,

355
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:12,275
but it's too late now.
I hope you can remember them.

356
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,579
Now, "breathing." Bret, you've got
to remember to keep breathing, okay?

357
00:19:15,646 --> 00:19:17,047
- The whole time.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

358
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,249
Yesterday's rehearsal
you got yourself worked up,

359
00:19:19,317 --> 00:19:21,051
you stopped breathing
and you fainted.

360
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,352
- No, I didn't.
- You were on the ground there for a while,

361
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,354
- about five minutes.
- Yeah, about five minutes.

362
00:19:24,422 --> 00:19:27,290
- I really got bored of that bit.
- Unconscious for five minutes?

363
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:29,693
Mm-hmm.
Okay, and finally,

364
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,162
Jemaine, just a little
point with your acting.

365
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:35,165
I've noticed your acting
tends to be a bit boring.

366
00:19:35,233 --> 00:19:37,934
It's okay for the first minute,
then I kind of drift off.

367
00:19:38,002 --> 00:19:40,003
So kind of... if you can try
and stop that, that'd be great.

368
00:19:40,071 --> 00:19:42,472
- Hey, malcolm.
- Hey.

369
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:44,574
Have a good one tonight.
You're my favorite actor.

370
00:19:46,277 --> 00:19:47,844
All right,
this is it!

371
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:49,846
Onto stage.
Off you go.

372
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:52,115
Hang on! You haven't got your
costumes on! What are you wearing?

373
00:19:52,183 --> 00:19:54,351
Quickly, get your
costumes on! Down that way!

374
00:19:58,089 --> 00:20:01,892
Jemaine, nobody wants to listen to
the music of a couple of shepherds.

375
00:20:01,959 --> 00:20:04,828
I know of a place...

376
00:20:08,466 --> 00:20:10,934
somewhere we can
play music every day

377
00:20:11,002 --> 00:20:12,836
without having
to shepherd.

378
00:20:12,904 --> 00:20:15,438
A place called...

379
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,844
¶ America ¶

380
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:24,648
¶ I've been shepherding
day and night ¶

381
00:20:24,715 --> 00:20:27,350
¶ saving for the flight
to America ¶

382
00:20:27,418 --> 00:20:29,152
¶ America... ¶

383
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:32,055
- don't go there!
- They're crazy!

384
00:20:32,156 --> 00:20:34,090
¶ in the paddock
every day ¶

385
00:20:34,158 --> 00:20:36,860
¶ trying to work my way
to America... ¶

386
00:20:36,928 --> 00:20:40,030
<i>- they'll kill youse!
- They have guns!</i>

387
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,674
Bret, look.
There she is.

388
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,744
It's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen

389
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:59,583
¶ welcome to the land
of opportunity ¶

390
00:20:59,684 --> 00:21:03,887
¶ I am the statue
of liberty... ¶

391
00:21:03,955 --> 00:21:06,790
welcome.
Welcome.

392
00:21:06,857 --> 00:21:09,059
Forget about it.

393
00:21:10,761 --> 00:21:13,396
¶ my head's stuck
in this chair ¶

394
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:19,402
¶ gotta get my head
out of this chair... ¶

395
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:26,943
- Jemaine!
- Hey, there, man, would you...

396
00:21:28,379 --> 00:21:30,780
miss, would you
be interested in...

397
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:37,420
¶ I'm selling myself
on the street ¶

398
00:21:37,488 --> 00:21:41,424
¶ just trying
to make ends meet ¶

399
00:21:43,027 --> 00:21:45,061
¶ who will buy ¶

400
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:47,397
¶ my body? ¶

401
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,867
¶ my body. ¶

402
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,372
- is there a problem with our rent?
- Yeah, there's a problem.

403
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,408
- Your money ain't good here!
- But wel be out on the streets.

404
00:21:58,476 --> 00:22:00,744
- We've got nothing.
- We'll have nowhere to live.

405
00:22:00,811 --> 00:22:04,147
You're in America now.
You pay with American dollars.

406
00:22:04,215 --> 00:22:07,617
Now scram, you filthy
illegal immigrants.

407
00:22:10,221 --> 00:22:12,022
You've got one month!

408
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:15,292
Illegal immigrants,
illegal immigrants...

409
00:22:15,359 --> 00:22:17,994
¶ we've overstayed our welcome,
we've overstayed our visas ¶

410
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:20,964
¶ nobody cares,
nobody needs us! ¶

411
00:22:20,998 --> 00:22:24,167
¶ nobody needs us! ¶

412
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,972
well, guys,
I've got an idea.

413
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,941
We need more than ideas. We need money.

414
00:22:31,008 --> 00:22:34,778
- Wait wait, hear him out.
- ¶ we'll put on a musical! ¶

415
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:37,047
- it's genius!
- It's marvelous!

416
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:39,950
¶ a wonderful musical... ¶

417
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:47,190
yes!

418
00:23:04,809 --> 00:23:06,309
Murray was right.

419
00:23:06,377 --> 00:23:09,145
It was a great idea
to put on a musical.

420
00:23:09,213 --> 00:23:11,047
Murray's the greatest.

421
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:13,750
Jemaine, I think
we've made it in America.

422
00:23:13,818 --> 00:23:16,720
Yeah, but we mustn't forget
where we came from.

423
00:23:16,787 --> 00:23:18,855
I remember.

424
00:23:24,795 --> 00:23:26,796
Oh, Doug.

425
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,536
Whoo! Look at
the harp player!

426
00:23:33,938 --> 00:23:36,706
<i>It is manly.</i>

427
00:23:36,774 --> 00:23:38,842
Oh!

428
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,177
- Hey.
- Well done.

429
00:23:41,245 --> 00:23:43,079
<i>- Bravo!
- Good harping.</i>

430
00:23:43,147 --> 00:23:45,015
Bravo, guys.

431
00:23:45,082 --> 00:23:48,552
- Is it a hit?
- Well, it depends how you define "hit."

432
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:50,253
- You know, did people...
- did people like it?

433
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:53,189
No, I don't think
it was that sort of hit.

434
00:23:53,257 --> 00:23:55,926
<i>- No, I didn't think so.
- But you enjoyed yourselves, right?</i>

435
00:23:55,993 --> 00:23:57,861
Well, that's what
it's about.

436
00:23:57,929 --> 00:23:59,930
Jemaine, your acting...
really good.

437
00:23:59,997 --> 00:24:01,598
- Thank you.
- Okay, you're still a bit boring.

438
00:24:01,666 --> 00:24:05,602
And Bret, great cover
on the fainting.

439
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,072
I've got lots of news...
uh, good news,

440
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,875
got some... just a little
bit of terrible news there,

441
00:24:11,943 --> 00:24:15,011
- but, umm... - well, let's
start with the good news.

442
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:17,581
- Okay. Well, "we did it."
- "We did it."

443
00:24:17,648 --> 00:24:19,583
I've written that there.
That's good.

444
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,618
- "We did it." that's the good news?
- That's it?

445
00:24:21,686 --> 00:24:24,054
Yeah, we did it! So that's
something to be proud of.

446
00:24:24,121 --> 00:24:26,957
- What's the terrible news?
- Just a bit of terrible news.

447
00:24:27,024 --> 00:24:29,659
Umm...

448
00:24:29,727 --> 00:24:33,230
remember I invited some embassy
officials to see the show?

449
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:36,566
- Well, that was good.
- Unfortunately the play Drew

450
00:24:36,634 --> 00:24:38,635
a lot of attention to your
illegal immigrant status.

451
00:24:38,703 --> 00:24:40,270
Well, that's what
it's about, isn't it?

452
00:24:40,338 --> 00:24:43,807
Exactly. And the dance
number "illegal immigrants."

453
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:45,609
- It was a good number.
- A great number...

454
00:24:45,643 --> 00:24:49,312
- ah.
...but not great to perform in front of these people.

455
00:24:49,413 --> 00:24:51,815
So overall great, yes,

456
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:55,652
- but also not great.
- So average?

457
00:24:55,753 --> 00:24:57,487
Uh...

458
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,791
- oh, do they want to meet us?
- They want to see you, yeah.

459
00:25:01,859 --> 00:25:05,662
So in addition to the good
news and the terrible news,

460
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:07,831
there's also some...

461
00:25:07,932 --> 00:25:10,500
truly awful news.

462
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:26,983
Good shepherding
today, guys!

463
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:29,019
Thanks, Murray!

464
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,687
(And thanks, Sixe!)
