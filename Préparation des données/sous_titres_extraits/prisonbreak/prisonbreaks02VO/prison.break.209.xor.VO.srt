00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:02,454
<i>Previously, on</i> Prison Break...

2
00:00:02,489 --> 00:00:04,747
Excuse me, ladies,
I need to ask you a few questions.

3
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,289
And then that dirty southerner,

4
00:00:06,817 --> 00:00:07,994
he snuck out the back.

5
00:00:08,558 --> 00:00:10,831
Do you really think
the diaper sniper got all of it?

6
00:00:10,866 --> 00:00:11,839
If you were Bagwell,

7
00:00:11,904 --> 00:00:13,935
and you just got your hands
on $5 million,

8
00:00:14,252 --> 00:00:15,591
where would you go?

9
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,000
All right, listen,

10
00:00:17,082 --> 00:00:18,162
<i>in the Rainbow Room.</i>

11
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,409
Restaurant in New York city.

12
00:00:19,468 --> 00:00:21,048
I am gonna be waiting

13
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:22,509
in that spot.

14
00:00:23,044 --> 00:00:24,486
<i>And that's all that I want...</i>

15
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,373
<i>in this whole world,</i>

16
00:00:26,450 --> 00:00:28,538
is for my two girls
to be waiting there for me.

17
00:00:37,779 --> 00:00:39,744
Three dots, third letter.

18
00:00:44,376 --> 00:00:45,530
Question is "where"?

19
00:00:46,497 --> 00:00:49,152
What? What are you trying
to tell me, Michael?

20
00:00:49,479 --> 00:00:51,435
I think I owe you an apology.

21
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,158
Because I lied to you.

22
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:55,858
About Oscar Shales.

23
00:00:57,327 --> 00:00:58,464
Right there.

24
00:00:59,529 --> 00:01:01,116
That's where I put the bullet in him.

25
00:01:02,965 --> 00:01:04,082
What are you doing, man?

26
00:01:05,378 --> 00:01:06,982
You've been hired to do a job.

27
00:01:07,078 --> 00:01:08,377
The reasoning...

28
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,033
does not concern you.

29
00:01:10,108 --> 00:01:11,728
You don't ask any questions about us,

30
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:14,604
maybe we'll continue to make sure
no one asks any questions about you.

31
00:01:14,643 --> 00:01:15,702
Are we clear?

32
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:19,390
They all die.

33
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:54,085
Hey.

34
00:01:54,913 --> 00:01:55,973
Hey.

35
00:01:56,185 --> 00:01:57,366
Are you new?

36
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,831
Yeah.

37
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:02,094
No one told me we were getting
a new volunteer.

38
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:04,174
I've been working, uh,

39
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:06,465
night shifts, cleanup and...

40
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:09,034
Jimmy said I could change
my shift, so...

41
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,076
You know what you're doing?

42
00:02:12,309 --> 00:02:13,500
Yeah.

43
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:15,542
I'll see you around.

44
00:02:15,753 --> 00:02:16,755
Right.

45
00:03:16,712 --> 00:03:17,791
This might be Scofield.

46
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:18,974
<i>Copy that.</i>

47
00:03:52,869 --> 00:03:53,987
You take that side.

48
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:29,704
Freeze!

49
00:04:29,752 --> 00:04:31,042
Take it easy, man.

50
00:04:31,446 --> 00:04:33,257
- Stay on the ground!
- What's the deal?

51
00:04:34,624 --> 00:04:35,722
He's gone.

52
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:42,436
How you feeling?

53
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:44,458
Okay, I guess.

54
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:46,099
Tired.

55
00:04:48,545 --> 00:04:49,970
I'm a target, kid.

56
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,740
As long as you're with me, so are you.

57
00:04:53,315 --> 00:04:55,865
Things could get a lot worse
before they get better.

58
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:56,963
You understand?

59
00:04:56,982 --> 00:04:59,334
But after we meet up with uncle Mike
and get to Panama...

60
00:04:59,353 --> 00:05:00,518
Panama ain't a sure thing,

61
00:05:00,556 --> 00:05:02,059
Your uncle's plan is dangerous.

62
00:05:02,117 --> 00:05:03,349
I mean really dangerous.

63
00:05:05,452 --> 00:05:06,453
Listen...

64
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:09,762
all the charges against you
have been dropped;

65
00:05:09,858 --> 00:05:11,939
you're free and clear
to start a new life.

66
00:05:12,035 --> 00:05:13,191
A good life.

67
00:05:13,384 --> 00:05:14,597
Not be constantly running,

68
00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:17,155
- looking over your shoulder...
- You want me to leave?

69
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,911
No.

70
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,220
No.

71
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:28,225
Good, 'cause I'm not.

72
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:42,049
Turn the sound up on the tube, Jenny.

73
00:05:43,758 --> 00:05:46,050
<i>Do you have any thoughts
on the death of David Apolskis?</i>

74
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:49,144
<i>It was unfortunate.</i>

75
00:05:49,211 --> 00:05:51,453
<i>- Tests show he was shot at close range.
- Oh, David.</i>**

76
00:05:51,492 --> 00:05:53,259
<i>Was there any opportunity
to subdue him...</i>

77
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,858
let me remind you that despite his age,
David "Tweener" Apolskis

78
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:58,667
was a fugitive who made a move
for my weapon.

79
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,988
I did not want to have to kill him,

80
00:06:02,246 --> 00:06:04,981
but sometimes, things happen
that are just out of your control.

81
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:07,486
That good ole boy's hunting 'em all
down, ain't he?

82
00:06:07,544 --> 00:06:09,877
<i>Mr. Mahone, sources claim
that you've recovered Scofield's</i>

83
00:06:09,935 --> 00:06:12,285
<i>hard drive and have obtained
substantial data from it.</i>

84
00:06:12,355 --> 00:06:13,347
What sources?

85
00:06:13,385 --> 00:06:15,697
<i>Allegedly you've retrieved information
detailing not only</i>

86
00:06:15,716 --> 00:06:18,178
how he broke out, but how he plans
to stay out. Comments?

87
00:06:18,228 --> 00:06:19,210
No.

88
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:21,595
<i>The event at Blanding
Botanical Gardens earlier today,</i>

89
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:24,147
that was a result of hard-drive data
you collected.

90
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:26,379
No comment.

91
00:06:26,695 --> 00:06:29,190
<i>You found other locations
where Scofield might be headed?</i>

92
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:30,913
<i>- True?
- I believe I said no comment.</i>

93
00:06:30,914 --> 00:06:32,359
<i>There's something about this guy,</i>

94
00:06:32,417 --> 00:06:35,017
<i>it's like he knows where we're going,
what we're thinking.</i>

95
00:06:35,558 --> 00:06:37,773
<i>Mr. Mahone, could you tell us
where you're headed next?</i>

96
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:40,018
<i>What role will the hard drive
play in your search?</i>

97
00:06:43,251 --> 00:06:45,774
Heard it came back
from the lab, any findings?

98
00:06:45,813 --> 00:06:48,647
Yeah, 3,200 nitroglycerine ampules.

99
00:06:48,917 --> 00:06:52,154
Scofield knew these needed
to be stored in a cool, moist area.

100
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:55,717
Best place for that in the Utah desert
is the botanical gardens.

101
00:06:55,755 --> 00:06:56,718
It's stable?

102
00:06:56,776 --> 00:06:59,778
All medical grade, safely used
by heart patients all the time.

103
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:01,402
But in the aggregate...

104
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,086
it could take out an entire building.

105
00:07:03,202 --> 00:07:04,454
That box right there.

106
00:07:06,369 --> 00:07:08,006
This is why we can't have...

107
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,048
leaks...

108
00:07:11,112 --> 00:07:12,672
coming from this office.

109
00:07:13,462 --> 00:07:16,065
God help the agent
who goes behind my back

110
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,126
and talks to the press.

111
00:07:27,002 --> 00:07:29,988
<i>Can you elaborate on
any of your tactics in this manhunt?</i>

112
00:07:31,463 --> 00:07:33,191
<i>Sun Tzu said
that if you know your enemy,</i>

113
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,783
<i>you need not fear a hundred battles.</i>

114
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,977
<i>I know these men...</i>

115
00:07:36,026 --> 00:07:37,471
<i>who they are, where they came from,</i>

116
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:38,761
<i>where they want to go.</i>

117
00:07:42,988 --> 00:07:44,067
<i>These convicts,</i>

118
00:07:45,135 --> 00:07:46,811
<i>are in an constant battle.</i>

119
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,527
<i>Not only with me,</i>

120
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:52,054
<i>but with themselves,</i>

121
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,051
<i>second guessing
every decision thet make.</i>

122
00:07:59,893 --> 00:08:01,242
<i>Do I turn left?</i>

123
00:08:02,464 --> 00:08:03,533
<i>Do I turn right?</i>

124
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,722
<i>Stay, or go?</i>

125
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:12,834
<i>My job is to know
how they answer these questions.</i>

126
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,358
The only way to win a war
is to try to know your prey completely

127
00:08:17,514 --> 00:08:20,277
and then you get to go after your enemy
with everything you've got.

129
00:08:58,248 --> 00:08:59,905
Our half-priced stuff is in the back.

130
00:09:00,426 --> 00:09:02,415
I'm looking for something very specific.

131
00:09:02,878 --> 00:09:03,918
Okay.

132
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:09,708
This is it.

133
00:09:11,391 --> 00:09:13,259
This is exactly what I need.

134
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,610
Great.

135
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,226
We were just inches away today,

136
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,415
inches.

137
00:09:20,454 --> 00:09:21,727
I want these blown up, huge.

138
00:09:21,766 --> 00:09:23,977
- Put them in my office on the walls.
- What are these?

139
00:09:24,015 --> 00:09:25,340
Somewhere in there is information

140
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,380
regarding a rendezvous
that Scofield set up,

141
00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:29,369
and we're going
to crack that code today. Lang!

142
00:09:29,408 --> 00:09:30,957
Today's the day Franklin told his wife

143
00:09:30,986 --> 00:09:32,748
he's going to meet her
at the Rainbow Room.

144
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:34,208
- Right.
- Wrong. Today's the day

145
00:09:34,266 --> 00:09:35,784
Franklin's going down. Are you ready?

146
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:37,152
Everything's arranged.

147
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,689
It's all here?

148
00:10:05,544 --> 00:10:07,838
Hey, yo, Tray, wassup, big?

149
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:10,682
I know that ain't you.

150
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:12,069
Ain't a ghost, man.

151
00:10:13,147 --> 00:10:14,248
You holding up all right?

152
00:10:14,326 --> 00:10:17,574
Yeah. Caught a whole bunch of buses
just to get here to Chi-town, man.

153
00:10:17,702 --> 00:10:19,381
How you think I'm supposed to feel?

154
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,077
Chris. Jay.

155
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:24,470
Wassup, Flam?
You look like you lost a few, bro.

156
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:25,760
Slim-fast, baby.

157
00:10:25,818 --> 00:10:27,012
Is that what it is?

158
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:29,382
The Feds been
in your old lady's business, no joke.

159
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:30,549
Up in your crib,

160
00:10:30,587 --> 00:10:33,265
- and following her around sometimes.
- Yeah, I know, man. I know.

161
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:34,487
Yo, I know you love Kacee,

162
00:10:34,526 --> 00:10:37,404
but I don't know if it's a good idea
for you to be coming around here.

163
00:10:37,488 --> 00:10:38,528
You're a wanted man.

164
00:10:38,586 --> 00:10:40,549
I'm wanted because I kept my mouth shut,

165
00:10:40,597 --> 00:10:42,050
and I kept you out of Fox River.

166
00:10:42,088 --> 00:10:43,492
See, man, we feel that,

167
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,937
and we owe you one.

168
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:48,040
Good, 'cause I'm collecting right now.

169
00:10:49,336 --> 00:10:50,783
My wife is waiting for me today,

170
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:52,898
and I am not leaving Chi-town
without my family.

171
00:10:52,955 --> 00:10:54,015
You understand?

172
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:55,422
Now, y'all going to help me.

173
00:10:55,885 --> 00:10:57,098
Let's roll out.

174
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:12,352
Where you going?

175
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:16,629
Take my kid to school.

176
00:11:17,572 --> 00:11:19,059
I know about the Rainbow Room.

177
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:20,715
I don't know what you're talking about.

178
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,102
Phone lines are tapped.

179
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:24,862
We heard your entire telephone
conversation with your husband.

180
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:27,497
And, since you and Dede aren't booked
on any flights to New York,

181
00:11:27,516 --> 00:11:30,271
don't tell me the Rainbow Room
is a restaurant in Manhattan.

182
00:11:30,468 --> 00:11:32,799
Now, you can tell me
where you're meeting your husband,

183
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:34,075
or I can arrest you

184
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,860
right in front of your daughter.

185
00:11:37,393 --> 00:11:38,452
You go to hell.

186
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,331
I haven't done anything wrong.

187
00:11:42,657 --> 00:11:45,615
You spoke with an escaped felon
about meeting him today.

188
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:48,485
You've already done enough to be charged
with attempt to aid and abet.

189
00:11:48,523 --> 00:11:49,775
Please, okay?

190
00:11:50,141 --> 00:11:52,122
- Listen to me.
- One phone call

191
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,470
and child welfare is here,

192
00:11:53,528 --> 00:11:55,936
and you're going to county
and Dede will be in foster care.

193
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:56,939
- No.
- Don't worry.

194
00:11:56,978 --> 00:12:00,233
I hear the families
in the foster system are top-notch.

195
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:07,350
You are asking me to choose

196
00:12:07,383 --> 00:12:09,772
between my daughter and my husband.

197
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:12,449
Exactly.

198
00:12:13,784 --> 00:12:14,748
Anything?

199
00:12:14,786 --> 00:12:17,511
I'm on the phone with Fox River,
Checking T-bag's file.

200
00:12:18,546 --> 00:12:19,979
Hey, what you got for me?

201
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,092
Really?

202
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:25,311
52 times?

203
00:12:26,389 --> 00:12:27,391
Where?

204
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:31,721
I owe you, Patterson.

205
00:12:33,917 --> 00:12:35,535
We got a lot of road to cover.

206
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:57,117
We're good?

207
00:13:04,069 --> 00:13:05,973
No more stops
until we get to New Mexico.

208
00:13:08,921 --> 00:13:10,699
- You forgot your change.
- Yeah.

209
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,859
- Thanks.
- You were in such a rush.

210
00:13:13,032 --> 00:13:14,053
Thanks.

211
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,055
Keep walking.

212
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:20,577
Keep walking.

213
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,715
Come on, keep walking.

214
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:27,711
Damn it.

215
00:13:37,575 --> 00:13:39,748
You don't have to ditch the car.
We can keep driving.

216
00:13:40,017 --> 00:13:42,812
Can't. The waitress made me
and the car. It's useless.

217
00:13:45,181 --> 00:13:46,202
Sorry, you know.

218
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:47,919
Maybe we can find another car.

219
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:49,989
Cars ain't exactly
growing on trees out here.

220
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:52,603
We've got 400 miles to go
and no way of getting there.

221
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,427
We don't get to Michael in time,
he's going to leave without us.

222
00:13:55,831 --> 00:13:57,141
Uncle Mike wouldn't do that.

223
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,929
He doesn't have a choice.
It's a one-shot deal out of the country.

224
00:14:00,334 --> 00:14:01,489
I said I was sorry.

225
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,024
There was a sign
back there for a train station.

226
00:14:05,063 --> 00:14:07,007
- It ain't that easy.
- We'll follow the road...

227
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:08,798
- It ain't that easy.
- We won't be seen.

228
00:14:09,707 --> 00:14:11,210
Hey, I'm not an idiot.

229
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,623
I was on the run, too, you know.

230
00:14:15,645 --> 00:14:17,962
Yeah, you were on the run
and you got caught.

231
00:14:19,637 --> 00:14:23,328
Yeah, well, I'm sorry I'm not a pro
at being a con like you, dad.

232
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:26,420
Maybe I should have just left
when you gave me the out, huh?

233
00:14:27,085 --> 00:14:28,452
It's not like you care.

234
00:14:29,859 --> 00:14:31,073
Take it easy.

235
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:35,474
I'm sorry, all right?

236
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,647
Sorry, I'm just...

237
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:48,966
Let's get out of here.

238
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:03,032
Mrs. Pamela Mahone?

239
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:06,170
- Yes?
- Agent Wayne Merrick, F.B.I.

240
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:08,427
I'd like to talk to you
about your husband.

241
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,044
I'm surprised...

242
00:15:16,455 --> 00:15:18,966
that you're coming to me
for a background check on Alex.

243
00:15:19,062 --> 00:15:20,199
It's standard procedure.

244
00:15:20,231 --> 00:15:21,329
We run these kind of checks

245
00:15:21,386 --> 00:15:23,423
when an agent
is about to be promoted to a,

246
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,975
to a higher security clearance.

247
00:15:25,072 --> 00:15:26,112
No, I know that.

248
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,131
I did this dance
the last time he was promoted.

249
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:30,365
I just figured that
since we were divorced...

250
00:15:30,413 --> 00:15:33,680
I mean, I rarely speak to him
and I certainly don't follow his career.

251
00:15:33,754 --> 00:15:35,481
I really need to get this done today,

252
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:38,824
so... I promise I won't take up
much of your time.

253
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:42,895
I've given enough time
to my ex-husband, Mr. Merrick.

254
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:45,071
I see.

255
00:15:45,383 --> 00:15:46,616
The...

256
00:15:47,337 --> 00:15:49,677
The bureau can take
its toll on your family.

257
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:51,603
I understand that.

258
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:53,460
My ex-wife is a...

259
00:15:54,266 --> 00:15:55,864
An agent and...

260
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:58,775
let's just say I know how you feel.

261
00:16:03,733 --> 00:16:06,382
Promise me that he won't find out
we spoke?

262
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,769
Oh, it's totally confidential.

263
00:16:08,655 --> 00:16:10,089
Do you mind if I ask why?

264
00:16:10,235 --> 00:16:11,738
To be perfectly honest,

265
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:13,674
he scares me.

266
00:16:48,665 --> 00:16:49,628
<i>Information.</i>

267
00:16:49,682 --> 00:16:51,840
Hi, I need the number
for a Sundown hotel please.

268
00:16:51,917 --> 00:16:52,931
What state?

269
00:16:53,124 --> 00:16:55,801
- All of them, please.
- Got one in Pierre, South Dakota.

270
00:16:55,835 --> 00:16:58,226
- Ay.
- Another in Sutton, West Virginia

271
00:16:58,348 --> 00:16:59,850
and one more in Gila, New Mexico.

272
00:17:36,851 --> 00:17:37,891
What can I do you for?

273
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:39,594
A batch of them sunflowers, please.

274
00:17:39,652 --> 00:17:41,000
You don't mind me

275
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,230
saying, you do not sound
like you hail from Kansas.

276
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:44,689
You've got a sharp ear.

277
00:17:45,127 --> 00:17:46,830
I hail from what we call the,

278
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:48,766
yellowhammer state.

279
00:17:49,864 --> 00:17:51,447
What brings you to Tribune?

280
00:17:58,257 --> 00:17:59,297
Sir?

281
00:18:00,784 --> 00:18:01,825
Romance.

282
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:06,456
Thank you so much.

283
00:18:13,023 --> 00:18:14,679
Somebody's going to get hurt.

284
00:18:15,306 --> 00:18:17,377
Feds going to be swinging bigger bats
than these.

285
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:18,747
We gotta have ours.

286
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:22,080
Look, man, that's all we need
is your car, your truck,

287
00:18:22,372 --> 00:18:23,605
and some guts, man.

288
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,953
We don't need all of this.

289
00:18:25,058 --> 00:18:27,326
- Maybe we should think about it.
- I said no!

290
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:31,798
What's going to happen, man,
when the bullets start flying,

291
00:18:31,891 --> 00:18:34,323
<i>Can you guarantee me that my family
ain't going to get hurt?</i>

292
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:37,031
Johnny law is going to strapped up.
I'm going in hot.

293
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,642
I don't think you heard me, little man.

294
00:18:38,699 --> 00:18:40,220
No, I don't think you heard me, Bruh.

295
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:41,607
I'm not going in naked.

296
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,452
I know we said
we'd ride with you on this,

297
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:46,945
but I'm not going in there
without some of these.

298
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:58,193
You want to punk out, man?

299
00:18:58,405 --> 00:18:59,522
Then punk out,

300
00:18:59,811 --> 00:19:01,102
'cause I can do this myself.

301
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:05,719
Ain't nobody punking out.

302
00:19:06,295 --> 00:19:07,489
And no guns.

303
00:19:13,874 --> 00:19:16,809
But you'd better be right about this
'cause if bullets do start flying,

304
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:19,131
the only blood being spilled
is going to be ours.

305
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:21,037
Feel me?

306
00:19:23,026 --> 00:19:24,143
I feel you.

307
00:19:26,909 --> 00:19:28,122
Agent Kellerman.

308
00:19:28,537 --> 00:19:29,751
Agent Kellerman!

309
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:30,771
Yes.

310
00:19:30,829 --> 00:19:32,811
That name you wanted me
to track, Kelli Foster.

311
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,138
She booked a flight to New Mexico,
just landed.

312
00:19:36,195 --> 00:19:37,274
You got someone on it?

313
00:19:37,321 --> 00:19:39,334
No, but we got an ID on her rental car.

314
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,014
Should I update Mr. Kim?

315
00:19:41,761 --> 00:19:43,354
No, I'll take care of this myself.

316
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,526
Got a tip from a waitress
who thinks she saw Burrows

317
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,471
and his son outside St. David, Arizona.

318
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,241
get a road team out there to confirm.

319
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:56,187
Once they got a bead on Burrows,
notify me immediately.

320
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:57,870
Everybody out! Let's go, come on!

321
00:20:03,479 --> 00:20:04,442
Yeah?

322
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,408
Sara Tancredi just booked
a one-way ticket across the country.

323
00:20:09,109 --> 00:20:10,919
- To where?
<i>- New Mexico.</i>

324
00:20:14,064 --> 00:20:15,182
Of course.

325
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,447
Any luck breaking that code?

326
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:19,965
- This helps.
- Good.

327
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:29,275
Wheeler!

328
00:20:30,322 --> 00:20:31,324
Sir.

329
00:20:31,362 --> 00:20:33,600
Every combination that has "nm" in it.

330
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:34,655
I want you to check it

331
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:37,706
to see if it contains
the name of a location in New Mexico.

332
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:40,424
- And I want it done now. Right now.
- Now, you got it.

333
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,550
So, how well do you know Alex?

334
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,655
He knows me better than I know him.

335
00:20:46,928 --> 00:20:48,646
He's a closed book, all right.

336
00:20:48,798 --> 00:20:50,709
But he wasn't always like that.

337
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,511
In the first few years of our marriage,

338
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:58,025
he was actually... romantic.

339
00:21:00,587 --> 00:21:01,911
And then,

340
00:21:02,712 --> 00:21:05,235
one day, out of nowhere...

341
00:21:07,527 --> 00:21:09,363
Out of nowhere what?

342
00:21:10,461 --> 00:21:11,790
Everything changed.

343
00:21:12,075 --> 00:21:15,085
He became obsessed with getting out.

344
00:21:15,644 --> 00:21:16,718
Out of the marriage?

345
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,169
Getting out of the marriage,

346
00:21:18,207 --> 00:21:20,120
getting me out of the house,

347
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,411
out of his life.

348
00:21:21,565 --> 00:21:22,759
He left me.

349
00:21:24,189 --> 00:21:25,556
He left the both of us.

350
00:21:28,095 --> 00:21:30,263
You said you were scared of him.

351
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,861
Why is that?

352
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:34,202
He started acting strange.

353
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:37,713
Started spending all of his time
in the backyard gardening,

354
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:39,967
of all things. I mean,
the man was a neat freak.

355
00:21:40,044 --> 00:21:42,634
He'd throw away a pair of shoes
if they even got scuffed.

356
00:21:43,798 --> 00:21:45,088
But he'd be out there

357
00:21:45,127 --> 00:21:46,148
all covered in dirt

358
00:21:46,186 --> 00:21:49,572
and surrounded by these huge bags
of fertilizer and lye.

359
00:21:50,932 --> 00:21:53,114
We'd just put this new sod in

360
00:21:53,211 --> 00:21:55,984
and he just tore it all up
and planted a flower bed.

361
00:21:56,986 --> 00:21:58,727
And I went out back once to talk to him

362
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:02,000
and he screamed at me

363
00:22:02,636 --> 00:22:05,892
and said not to come near the garden.

364
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:08,029
Said that it was his.

365
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,035
I'm sorry. If you...

366
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,150
If you wanna take a break...

367
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,352
All I wanted was an explanation.

368
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:20,550
Why things ended so suddenly.

369
00:22:21,571 --> 00:22:23,488
And all Alex could say was:

370
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,880
"Sometimes, things happen"

371
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,176
"that are just out of your control."

372
00:22:54,935 --> 00:22:56,894
So the picture
in your daughter's bedroom,

373
00:22:56,922 --> 00:22:59,046
the exact location where it was taken

374
00:22:59,101 --> 00:23:00,701
was a merry-go-round, right?

375
00:23:01,602 --> 00:23:02,608
Yeah.

376
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:05,293
So, all you have to do
is wait by the merry-go-round.

377
00:23:05,928 --> 00:23:07,569
Right where Benjamin's expecting you.

378
00:23:10,439 --> 00:23:12,095
Is that necessary?

379
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,777
- I mean, Benjamin's not..
- It's precautionary.

380
00:23:18,387 --> 00:23:19,601
Look, I do this,

381
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:23,384
you leave me and my child alone.

382
00:23:24,198 --> 00:23:25,341
You have my word.

383
00:23:48,406 --> 00:23:49,678
Is my wife there?

384
00:23:50,213 --> 00:23:52,723
<i>- Yeah, she's here.
- Well, let's go get her.</i>

385
00:24:04,823 --> 00:24:07,458
<i>73, ready at position n°1.</i>

386
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:22,011
In 15 seconds,

387
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:25,804
a black Jeep is going to pull up
by the parking lot's entrance.

388
00:24:26,356 --> 00:24:27,238
Run to it.

389
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,397
Chris?

390
00:24:34,274 --> 00:24:35,281
Go!

391
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:37,088
I can't.

392
00:24:37,776 --> 00:24:38,935
They're gonna take Dede.

393
00:24:39,032 --> 00:24:40,094
Look, no, they won't.

394
00:24:40,735 --> 00:24:42,032
Is that guy talking to her?

395
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:42,832
Get a read on him.

396
00:24:42,854 --> 00:24:43,750
<i>Move to position.</i>

397
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:45,460
It's taken care of. Go!

398
00:24:51,018 --> 00:24:52,025
Go!

399
00:24:58,318 --> 00:25:01,451
She's running! She's running!
Go, go, go, go! Move, move!

400
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:11,904
Get in!

401
00:25:12,342 --> 00:25:13,349
Hold on!

402
00:25:24,496 --> 00:25:26,962
It's a 2007 black Jeep.

403
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:28,393
License plates have been removed.

404
00:25:28,462 --> 00:25:30,119
We're in pursuit, headed... No!

405
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:39,570
Move the truck.

406
00:25:40,301 --> 00:25:41,612
Move the truck!

407
00:25:42,335 --> 00:25:43,342
I said move it!

408
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:50,346
Where is my child?

409
00:25:50,842 --> 00:25:51,849
Here.

410
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,713
- Dede?
- Hey, it's me, baby.

411
00:25:56,485 --> 00:25:57,975
Look, I just want to tell you

412
00:25:58,678 --> 00:26:00,333
that everything is going to be okay.

413
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:02,851
We're gonna be a family again.
I promise you that.

414
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:05,292
Where is Dede? He said that you had her!

415
00:26:05,334 --> 00:26:06,658
No, no. Be easy, baby.

416
00:26:07,168 --> 00:26:08,175
Easy.

417
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:10,333
Darius is picking her up
from school right now.

418
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:14,638
Dede Franklin, Dawson elementary.

419
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,390
I want her pulled from school now!

420
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,904
<i>What the hell is going on, man?</i>

421
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:20,449
They say she's taking a test, man,

422
00:26:20,656 --> 00:26:21,931
but I think they're stalling.

423
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,074
What about...

424
00:26:28,536 --> 00:26:30,138
What about Oscar Shales?

425
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:32,276
Oscar Shales?

426
00:26:32,748 --> 00:26:33,976
Why is he important?

427
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:38,698
Well, he's...

428
00:26:38,767 --> 00:26:42,341
He's just the only fugitive
to ever successfully elude your...

429
00:26:43,224 --> 00:26:44,272
Your ex-husband.

430
00:26:45,076 --> 00:26:47,684
Alex was consumed with finding him.

431
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:50,004
I mean, after what Shales did
to all of his victims,

432
00:26:50,046 --> 00:26:51,121
who could blame him?

433
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:54,587
It was all he worked on,
all he did for a year.

434
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:58,042
But I don't think that it was the stress
of chasing Shales

435
00:26:58,086 --> 00:27:00,210
that caused Alex
to start behaving erratically.

436
00:27:00,762 --> 00:27:01,766
Why is that?

437
00:27:02,145 --> 00:27:04,900
Because Alex changed
after the trail went cold.

438
00:27:06,004 --> 00:27:08,076
I remember it like it was yesterday.
He just...

439
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:10,179
walked into the kitchen,

440
00:27:10,648 --> 00:27:12,658
after 12 years of marriage,

441
00:27:13,803 --> 00:27:16,761
and says that he wanted me
out of the house immediately.

442
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:19,492
I'll never forget the date.

443
00:27:20,532 --> 00:27:21,953
It was june 15.

444
00:27:24,773 --> 00:27:26,428
I think I have everything I need.

445
00:27:26,807 --> 00:27:28,255
But you didn't even ask about

446
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:30,193
social history or education?

447
00:27:30,221 --> 00:27:31,836
That's standard in these checks.

448
00:27:31,864 --> 00:27:32,705
That's been handled.

449
00:27:32,884 --> 00:27:37,062
I have to get these reports filed
with Strategic Operations asap.

450
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:38,814
You're with Strategic Operations?

451
00:27:39,017 --> 00:27:40,258
They handle these checks.

452
00:27:41,151 --> 00:27:44,039
Not since the 9/11 realignment,
Mr. Merrick.

453
00:27:44,081 --> 00:27:46,591
The Chief Information Officer
does them now.

454
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:49,441
They handled Alex's last check.

455
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:54,664
When an agent reaches a level
as high as your ex-husband's,

456
00:27:54,954 --> 00:27:56,940
S.O. takes over, again.

457
00:27:59,078 --> 00:28:00,085
Bureaucracies.

458
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:01,401
Thank you for the coffee.

459
00:28:08,148 --> 00:28:09,152
Look,

460
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:11,414
just get her out of here.

461
00:28:13,868 --> 00:28:14,924
They're here.

462
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,669
- No, C! We gotta go!
- No, don't worry about it.

463
00:28:24,711 --> 00:28:26,394
Just get the car started, all right? Go!

464
00:28:38,568 --> 00:28:40,487
- Daddy!
-Hey, baby!

465
00:28:40,575 --> 00:28:42,451
- You ready to go?
- Where are we going?

466
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,697
Disneyland.

467
00:28:43,946 --> 00:28:45,546
Mr. Franklin! You can't...

468
00:28:45,959 --> 00:28:46,704
They're here!

469
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,705
Come on, let's go!

470
00:28:55,409 --> 00:28:56,857
Go, baby. Go, baby.

471
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:58,322
Go, go, go!

472
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,758
Franklin has the child!
Repeat, Franklin has the child!

473
00:29:11,691 --> 00:29:13,078
<i>'Evening, Mrs. Hollander.</i>

474
00:29:13,956 --> 00:29:15,909
<i>Don't you look lovely this evening.</i>

475
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:18,086
<i>You should have told me what you were!</i>

476
00:29:18,124 --> 00:29:20,246
My God, I let you near my children!

477
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:24,060
Don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like.

478
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:24,055
Come on, get away from the road.
You wanna get caught?

479
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:27,986
I...

480
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,427
I saw you checking out
those girls back at the diner.

481
00:30:33,185 --> 00:30:34,192
What?

482
00:30:34,316 --> 00:30:35,927
Come on. Fess up.

483
00:30:36,681 --> 00:30:38,915
No. I was just making sure
they weren't staring at us.

484
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:40,357
With what? Their asses?

485
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,302
Beautiful girls in Panama.

486
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:44,736
They love Americans.

487
00:30:45,423 --> 00:30:46,403
Cool.

488
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:49,217
So, how long have you known about girls?

489
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:53,319
Long enough.

490
00:30:54,747 --> 00:30:55,761
Since when?

491
00:30:57,781 --> 00:30:58,832
Thirteen.

492
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,017
Thirteen?

493
00:31:00,933 --> 00:31:01,957
With who?

494
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:04,947
Donna Anselmi.

495
00:31:05,082 --> 00:31:06,537
She was the kid next door.

496
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:07,671
She was about...

497
00:31:07,961 --> 00:31:09,409
She's four years older than me.

498
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,576
Your mom was paying her
for French lessons.

499
00:31:11,811 --> 00:31:13,080
Well, she earned the money.

500
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,666
Come on.

501
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,155
Away from the road.

502
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,769
You're still way too close. Let's go.

503
00:31:25,404 --> 00:31:27,045
<i>You wanna learn some tricks, Gracey?</i>

504
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:27,759
<i>Like what?</i>

505
00:31:27,883 --> 00:31:28,877
Yeah.

506
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,590
I let you into my life.

507
00:31:35,335 --> 00:31:36,342
Yeah.

508
00:31:37,776 --> 00:31:39,087
Twenty seven!

509
00:31:46,343 --> 00:31:47,640
<i>Evening, Mrs. Hollander.</i>

510
00:32:23,345 --> 00:32:25,365
How are you feeling, little teddy?

511
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:30,233
Six.

512
00:33:10,057 --> 00:33:11,054
Tomorrow.

513
00:33:23,306 --> 00:33:25,035
Pam, I really can't talk right now.

514
00:33:25,546 --> 00:33:26,815
<i>Maybe I should call back.</i>

515
00:33:30,636 --> 00:33:31,422
Who is this?

516
00:33:32,691 --> 00:33:33,960
I think you already know.

517
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:45,647
If you've done anything to Pam...

518
00:33:46,874 --> 00:33:47,909
or my boy...

519
00:33:47,955 --> 00:33:49,932
<i>We both know your family's fine.</i>

520
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:53,171
Although, Pam did seem
a little upset about you leaving.

521
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,386
<i>But then you had to,</i>

522
00:33:55,501 --> 00:33:56,503
didn't you?

523
00:33:58,324 --> 00:33:59,827
'Cause you couldn't let her find out.

524
00:34:00,675 --> 00:34:02,096
Find out about what?

525
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,129
<i>Oscar Shales.</i>

526
00:34:04,783 --> 00:34:05,721
You remember?

527
00:34:06,475 --> 00:34:07,588
The one that got away.

528
00:34:09,188 --> 00:34:10,747
Except he didn't get too far.

529
00:34:11,133 --> 00:34:12,098
Did he?

530
00:34:13,816 --> 00:34:16,144
- You're slipping, Scofield.
- Maybe.

531
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,695
Let's hypothesize for a moment.

532
00:34:18,888 --> 00:34:21,316
Let's pretend I was the one
who caught Shales.

533
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,553
<i>I don't think I could have just
handed that psychopath</i>

534
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:26,690
<i>over to the courts,</i>

535
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:29,553
<i>not after he'd eluded me for so long.</i>

536
00:34:29,988 --> 00:34:31,381
Made me look bad.

537
00:34:32,941 --> 00:34:35,024
You've been out in the sun
way too long, boy.

538
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:36,830
<i>You Feds make a nice living,</i>

539
00:34:36,926 --> 00:34:39,898
<i>but not so nice you go around
tearing up expensive sod.</i>

540
00:34:40,236 --> 00:34:41,999
Not unless you had to do
a little digging,

541
00:34:42,145 --> 00:34:44,062
not unless you wanted
to hide something...

542
00:34:44,945 --> 00:34:45,952
<i>or someone.</i>

543
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:49,941
That's what all the lye was for.

544
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:51,609
Wasn't it?

545
00:34:52,636 --> 00:34:54,789
<i>See, because there are two kinds
of lye.</i>

546
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:58,834
<i>Small amounts, the first kind
can be a garderner's best friend.</i>

547
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:01,562
And large bags, the other kind
decomposes bodies.

548
00:35:01,888 --> 00:35:03,720
You should write mystery novels.

549
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,144
<i>Now, I don't know about you,</i>

550
00:35:06,862 --> 00:35:09,384
but if I buried someone
in my own backyard,

551
00:35:11,411 --> 00:35:12,997
<i>I'd think about it all the time.</i>

552
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:16,217
<i>I'd think...</i>

553
00:35:16,982 --> 00:35:19,208
<i>I'd think maybe
I should move that body.</i>

554
00:35:22,046 --> 00:35:23,260
<i>But then I'd remember,</i>

555
00:35:23,646 --> 00:35:25,922
<i>that D.N.A. leeches into soil.</i>

556
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:28,019
<i>So even when the body was gone,</i>

557
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,372
the proof of what I'd done
would still be there.

558
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,547
<i>I can imagine how it feels.</i>

559
00:35:36,848 --> 00:35:37,938
<i>The pressure...</i>

560
00:35:39,786 --> 00:35:41,289
the constant fear.

561
00:35:43,814 --> 00:35:45,525
It's more than a man can bear.

562
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,707
<i>I give you a chance.</i>

563
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,947
Back off.

564
00:35:54,521 --> 00:35:56,535
Let me and my family disappear.

565
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:59,018
<i>And in return,</i>

566
00:35:59,371 --> 00:36:01,095
<i>I'll keep your little secret.</i>

567
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:04,196
<i>How does that sound?</i>

568
00:36:05,812 --> 00:36:07,737
Like a dead man talking.

569
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:11,962
<i>I know it's not how you wanted this
to play out.</i>

570
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,234
But sometimes,
things happen that are just...

571
00:36:17,152 --> 00:36:18,595
<i>out of your control.</i>

572
00:36:20,834 --> 00:36:22,393
<i>This is one of those times.</i>

573
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,306
Take care of yourself.

574
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,834
I'll see you soon, Michael.

575
00:36:33,305 --> 00:36:34,392
And... Michael!

576
00:36:36,593 --> 00:36:38,590
It just may be sooner than you think.

577
00:36:57,586 --> 00:36:58,827
Did you have a nice nap?

578
00:36:59,489 --> 00:37:02,375
Visions of 12 year olds
dancing in your head?

579
00:37:02,987 --> 00:37:05,194
You're trespassing.

580
00:37:05,304 --> 00:37:07,927
Nobody lives here anymore, Goldilocks.

581
00:37:08,243 --> 00:37:09,499
Seems the owner hit the bricks

582
00:37:09,588 --> 00:37:13,491
as soon as she heard
a certain someone had reentered society.

583
00:37:13,594 --> 00:37:16,303
Left in a hurry, too,
even left some stuff behind.

584
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:21,357
So this is where Theodore practiced

585
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,019
pervert knows best.

586
00:37:25,488 --> 00:37:26,517
This...

587
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,211
is where he had his family supper.

588
00:37:30,269 --> 00:37:32,241
And that, I believe

589
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,110
is where you and Ms. Hollander
expressed your love.

590
00:37:37,448 --> 00:37:38,523
Tell me, little Teddy,

591
00:37:38,868 --> 00:37:41,750
did you make her wear Dr. Denton's
and hold a lunch box

592
00:37:42,258 --> 00:37:43,872
to help you get all worked up?

593
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:48,258
Bradley, I couldn't possibly expect
a grown man

594
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,363
who still lives with his momma,

595
00:37:50,883 --> 00:37:53,241
to understand the machinations of love.

596
00:38:03,306 --> 00:38:05,072
You wanna know how we found you?

597
00:38:06,741 --> 00:38:09,706
52 mash notes,
sent by you to this address.

598
00:38:10,857 --> 00:38:15,303
All of them beggin' Ms. Hollander
to take your white-trash ass back.

599
00:38:16,308 --> 00:38:17,800
And every one of them

600
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,340
boomeranged to Fox Rive marked
"return to sender."

601
00:38:24,249 --> 00:38:26,434
The guards had a real laugh
readin' them,

602
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:28,352
- didn't we, Geary?
- Damn right, we did.

603
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:30,931
That is one

604
00:38:31,496 --> 00:38:34,130
mangy lookin' paw you got there, slick.

605
00:38:34,296 --> 00:38:36,322
What happened? A boy scout fought back?

606
00:38:36,351 --> 00:38:37,358
Geary?

607
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:39,214
Now you're gonna tell me

608
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,566
where you stashed Westmoreland's money,

609
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,930
or I'm going to pluck you
like a chicken,

610
00:38:44,412 --> 00:38:45,847
stitch by stitch.

611
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:57,001
Fine. You wanna know where the money is?

612
00:38:58,528 --> 00:39:01,272
I did spend a whole bunch of it
last night on your momma.

613
00:39:05,007 --> 00:39:06,111
Wrong answer.

614
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,956
Come here, baby.

615
00:39:27,417 --> 00:39:28,258
How are you?

616
00:39:30,012 --> 00:39:30,895
- You good?
- Yeah.

617
00:39:30,947 --> 00:39:32,052
She's okay.

618
00:39:47,872 --> 00:39:49,784
- Baby?
- Yeah?

619
00:39:51,904 --> 00:39:52,980
What do we do, now?

620
00:40:27,947 --> 00:40:29,190
What are we gonna do?

621
00:40:30,034 --> 00:40:31,396
Get a ticket on the train.

622
00:40:32,081 --> 00:40:33,084
Come on.

623
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:36,119
Just wait here until the train comes.

624
00:42:10,202 --> 00:42:11,760
Two caucasian males on foot,

625
00:42:11,802 --> 00:42:13,236
fleeing the Willcox station.

626
00:42:28,227 --> 00:42:29,238
L.J!

627
00:42:33,235 --> 00:42:34,106
Don't move!

628
00:42:35,449 --> 00:42:37,882
Please. Please.
He's got nothing to do with this.

629
00:42:37,883 --> 00:42:39,384
Face down. Both of you, face down!

630
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:40,576
- Please.
- Now!

631
00:42:42,865 --> 00:42:43,782
Cuff 'em.

632
00:42:48,548 --> 00:42:49,748
L.J, I'm sorry.

633
00:42:51,589 --> 00:42:54,864
Suspect in custody.
Possible I.D: Lincoln Burrows.

634
00:42:58,877 --> 00:42:59,991
I'm sorry.

635
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:02,965
L.J, I'm sorry.
