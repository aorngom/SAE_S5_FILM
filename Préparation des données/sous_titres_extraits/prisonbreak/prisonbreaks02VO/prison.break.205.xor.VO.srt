00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:07,236
<i>Previously on Prison Break</i>

2
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:09,094
There's something about this guy.

3
00:00:09,306 --> 00:00:11,881
It's like he knows where we're going
and what we're thinking.

4
00:00:11,909 --> 00:00:14,157
<i>If it's true, it won't be long
before he finds out</i>

5
00:00:14,163 --> 00:00:15,138
<i>about the money in Utah,</i>

6
00:00:15,196 --> 00:00:17,205
our way into Mexico... Everything.

7
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:24,700
...have an attorney present

8
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,468
during questioning
now or in the future...

9
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:27,799
Caroline, they're taking her in.

10
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,276
Of course. I'll keep an eye on her.

11
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:30,882
I did it, Dad.

12
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:32,844
Just do as you're told.

13
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,152
Otherwise, there will be consequences

14
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:36,636
that will affect us all.

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:38,716
My dad's an Air Force colonel.

16
00:00:38,798 --> 00:00:42,245
When I told him I was staying
in a hotel with a guy that...

17
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:44,272
I maybe sorta liked,

18
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,512
he lost it.

19
00:00:47,509 --> 00:00:49,242
What are you doing here?
Where's Maricruz?

20
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:50,282
She's with me now.

21
00:00:50,313 --> 00:00:51,520
He's gonna be where she is.

22
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:53,433
Hey, Fernando, slow down, man.

23
00:00:53,434 --> 00:00:56,219
I was trying to tell you,
the wedding is in Vegas.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,909
Which one of them was it?

25
00:00:59,967 --> 00:01:01,065
Might be Scofield.

26
00:01:01,176 --> 00:01:03,160
Probably gonna find his brother
in there, too.

27
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,109
<i>Where to, sir?</i>

28
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,300
Utah.

29
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,452
<i>This morning, authorities in Illinois</i>

30
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:19,494
<i>issued an update on the escaped convicts</i>

31
00:01:19,552 --> 00:01:21,998
<i>known until now as the Fox River Eight.</i>

32
00:01:22,422 --> 00:01:24,914
<i>Chicago mob boss John Abruzzi

33
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:27,481
<i>outside a Washington D. C. motel
last night,</i>

34
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,530
<i>after investigators received a tip
from an informant.</i>

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,081
<i>The other seven escapees</i>

36
00:01:32,158 --> 00:01:34,644
<i>are still at large
and considered dangerous.</i>

37
00:01:35,511 --> 00:01:37,264
<i>A Florida man wanted in...</i>

38
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:41,718
I didn't think Abruzzi'd be
the first to hit it.

39
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:44,742
I have a feeling we're in
for lots of surprises.

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,663
They said seven are still out there.

41
00:01:46,721 --> 00:01:48,146
So much for faking our deaths.

42
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,180
I bought us some time,
that's what counts.

43
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,436
How much further?

44
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,800
70, 80 miles.

45
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,421
Good. Means we should be hitting

46
00:01:58,479 --> 00:01:59,962
the Double K Ranch by this afternoon.

47
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,888
Or we can pick up L.J. and hit Panama.

48
00:02:01,927 --> 00:02:03,236
We can't hit Panama!

49
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:06,307
We can't hit anything! We can't do
anything without the money.

50
00:02:06,384 --> 00:02:08,542
We need to find Charles's stash.

51
00:02:10,785 --> 00:02:13,400
I know some other guys
who are thinking the same thing.

52
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:21,664
The money is buried under a silo
at the Double K Ranch

53
00:02:21,703 --> 00:02:24,551
just outside of Tooele, Utah.

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,192
There's five million dollars there.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,007
<i>Tickets?</i>

56
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:47,937
You know, when I was in Cheyenne,

57
00:02:48,328 --> 00:02:49,869
I pulled my ticket out of the bag.

58
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,860
It tore in half, and...

59
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,882
I have no idea what happened
to the other part.

60
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:56,300
They didn't issue you a replacement?

61
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,162
No. The young lady,
I think her name was Sherry,

62
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,300
she actually said
that this half is okay

63
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,795
because the bar code is on it.

64
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:04,760
Well, you really need the whole ticket.

65
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,684
This is exactly
what I was trying to avoid.

66
00:03:07,741 --> 00:03:09,819
She said that everything
would be fine because...

67
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:11,275
That's okay. It'll do for now.

68
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:13,510
But make sure you ask for a replacement

69
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,685
when you get to Provo.

70
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:16,200
I definitely will. Thank you.

71
00:03:18,035 --> 00:03:19,480
It's always something, huh?

72
00:03:19,557 --> 00:03:20,925
Oh, God, I know.

73
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,200
I don't wanna go home.

74
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,399
I wish we could keep driving.

75
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:41,024
I don't think your pops
will be down for that.

76
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,700
Wouldn't it be fun?

77
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,256
We could go to...

78
00:03:47,877 --> 00:03:48,917
Hawaii?

79
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,558
Yo, you can't drive to Hawaii.

80
00:03:52,696 --> 00:03:53,698
I know.

81
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:55,442
I'm just saying

82
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,610
I wish.

83
00:04:00,793 --> 00:04:02,300
No, no. Don't get it. They'll leave.

84
00:04:02,424 --> 00:04:03,945
Just let me see who it is.

85
00:04:09,824 --> 00:04:10,864
It's a cop.

86
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:12,944
No, no, no, no.

87
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,303
Sorry to disturb you, ma'am.

88
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,114
Have you happened to see this person?

00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:33,719
Transcript www.1000fr.com
Resync, corrections: www.sub-way.fr

90
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,842
Last night we got a few phone calls

91
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,425
that he was spotted in the area.

92
00:04:58,692 --> 00:05:00,214
So we're going door-to-door.

93
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,725
Why are you looking for him?

94
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,333
He escaped from prison in Illinois

95
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,632
a couple of days ago.

96
00:05:05,858 --> 00:05:06,937
Have you seen him?

97
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,307
No.

98
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,526
He doesn't look familiar.

99
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,383
Are you sure?

100
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,200
Yeah. I'm sure.

101
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:25,140
All right. Thanks for your time.

102
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:34,506
This ain't...

103
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:36,759
This is not what you think, all right?

104
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,042
Look.

105
00:05:38,573 --> 00:05:41,205
Listen to me, this... Just... listen.

106
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,699
Okay?

107
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,704
All I did was steal a baseball card.

108
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,200
Okay? I'm not like those other fools
up in there.

109
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:53,629
I'm gonna go for a walk, okay?

110
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,799
- Listen...
- I'm gonna leave my keys right here.

111
00:05:57,725 --> 00:05:58,900
And when I come back,

112
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,154
my car will be gone.

113
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:03,341
I'm sure,

114
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:04,699
in a few hours,

115
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,682
they'll find it somewhere...

116
00:06:07,932 --> 00:06:09,030
abandoned.

117
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,507
Wait. Wait.

118
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,619
I wish it could be different.

119
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:27,157
I have to go.

120
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,852
"Too-le."

121
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,656
I think it's "To-ill-uh."

122
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,417
Hell of a town.

123
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:51,897
Small is good.

124
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,500
Means the ranch'll be easier to find.

125
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,580
All we got to do is get that money

126
00:06:56,782 --> 00:06:58,417
and we'll be out of here by nightfall.

127
00:06:58,474 --> 00:06:59,500
Right.

128
00:07:16,475 --> 00:07:18,957
FBI FIELD OFFICE

129
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:23,499
Oh, sir. Soil test came back
from Scofield's crash.

130
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,200
Not that you need
any more proof, but...

131
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,400
he really went out of his way
this time.

132
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,123
What else do you have?

133
00:07:29,489 --> 00:07:31,434
A man was violently assaulted
in Nebraska

134
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:33,572
by a hitchhiker matching
Bagwell's description.

135
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:35,483
He was headed west on the I-80.

136
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,231
Omaha's putting together photo lineup.

137
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,965
What do you have on Scofield?

138
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,834
What does anybody have on Scofield?

139
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:46,389
I've got some results
from his hard drive.

140
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:48,300
The one recovered from the river.

141
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:52,409
We were able to use the sector editor
to restore the master boot.

142
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:54,412
- So from that...
- I don't care how you did it.

143
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:55,529
What do you have?

144
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,663
More than half the contents
of the buffer.

145
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,785
About 60%.

146
00:08:07,244 --> 00:08:08,397
It looks pretty random.

147
00:08:08,427 --> 00:08:10,392
Print it up. All of it.
I want it on my desk.

148
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:16,026
Well, guess what?

149
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,279
No listing for a Double K Ranch.

150
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:21,209
Excuse me.

151
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,252
You know where I might find
a Double K Ranch?

152
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,345
What you call it?

153
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:25,676
Double K Ranch.

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,990
No.

155
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,025
You from around here?

156
00:08:28,082 --> 00:08:29,411
Yeah. Born and raised.

157
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,337
There's no Double-nothing.

158
00:08:31,627 --> 00:08:32,860
Great. Thank you.

159
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,356
Looks like Westmoreland

160
00:08:36,395 --> 00:08:38,764
spent his last breath
blowing smoke up your ass.

161
00:08:38,822 --> 00:08:40,305
There's one way to find out.

162
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,286
The county keeps property records.

163
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,484
Every plot is mapped out

164
00:08:44,638 --> 00:08:46,565
with dimensions. It's public record.

165
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:49,991
But if there is
a tax assessor's office here,

166
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,010
it's gonna be in there,

167
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:54,395
the Municipal Building.

168
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,939
Lot of cops in there, Michael.

169
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,546
<i>Dispatch.</i>

170
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,700
<i>Someone...someone
stole my car this morning.</i>

171
00:09:06,997 --> 00:09:08,854
<i>I'm at the Lotus Motel
off Interstate 80.</i>

172
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:10,633
<i>Did you see who took it?</i>

173
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,684
<i>No. I went out for a walk</i>

174
00:09:13,262 --> 00:09:14,999
<i>and when I came back, it was gone.</i>

175
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,961
<i>This morning?
Why didn't you call before?</i>

176
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:19,118
<i>I... I don't know.</i>

177
00:10:17,063 --> 00:10:18,100
Mr. Kellerman.

178
00:10:18,146 --> 00:10:19,306
Mr. Kim.

179
00:10:21,312 --> 00:10:22,853
Surprised to see
you in Chicago.

180
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,999
Just looking for updates.

181
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,600
Sara Tancredi. I'm on it.

182
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,509
Is pursuing her
the best use of your time?

183
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:30,610
It is.

184
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,376
She's in contact
with Scofield.

185
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:34,167
I was there when
he called yesterday.

186
00:10:34,681 --> 00:10:36,600
We stay with her,
she takes us right to him,

187
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:37,965
he takes us to Burrows.

188
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:40,684
All right.

189
00:10:41,251 --> 00:10:42,374
If you're that confident.

190
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,430
I am.

191
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,301
I'll let the President know.

192
00:10:46,378 --> 00:10:48,200
I contact the President directly.

193
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,330
I'll contact her.

194
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:54,349
Keep me posted.

195
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,899
<i>If you want to restore your dignity,</i>

196
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:24,352
<i>you need to take action.</i>

197
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:28,373
<i>Making amends requires much more
than saying "I'm sorry."</i>

198
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,582
It means learning to change.

199
00:11:31,245 --> 00:11:33,036
The apology is just the first step.

200
00:11:33,517 --> 00:11:37,099
The most important thing
is that you display honesty,

201
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,375
courage

202
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:40,180
and compassion

203
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,199
when you extend
your apologies.

204
00:11:42,457 --> 00:11:44,537
You need to earn
your forgiveness.

205
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,666
We'll talk about it more on Friday.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,179
I've got a great idea.

207
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,187
What's that?

208
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:06,588
Since you are such a fan

209
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:09,200
of lame, store-bought
blueberry pie,

210
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,088
I am going to bake you
a real pie of your choice

211
00:12:12,457 --> 00:12:13,376
tonight.

212
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,658
I can't.

213
00:12:18,396 --> 00:12:20,534
I really don't need to be seeing
anyone right now

214
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:21,767
who isn't my therapist.

215
00:12:23,738 --> 00:12:25,587
I've been a hermit lately, too.

216
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,926
My partner Daniel's
away on business.

217
00:12:27,984 --> 00:12:30,548
I've been sitting around
every night by myself.

218
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:32,400
Kind of pathetic.

219
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,603
I am so sorry.

220
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,000
I thought you meant...

221
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:40,141
I thought...

222
00:12:41,382 --> 00:12:42,600
The... The pie...

223
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:44,500
No.

224
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,599
- That's my ego.
- No, I was really talking about...

225
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,608
- Pie?
- Yeah.

226
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:51,919
Actual blueberries.
Like we'd make pie and watch

227
00:12:51,957 --> 00:12:53,421
- Fried Green Tomatoes.
- I get it,

228
00:12:53,460 --> 00:12:54,399
I get it.

229
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,460
I'm the best ex-junkie cook
in this town.

230
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,099
Thank you. I just... I gotta
clean my apartment.

231
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,864
It's disgusting, and I realize
that sounds like an excuse,

232
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,717
- it's not.
- No, no, no, I get it.

233
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,265
You do what you gotta do.

234
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,472
Have a good night.

235
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:12,695
Do you deliver?

236
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:23,629
Next batch.

237
00:13:53,988 --> 00:13:55,663
Just...
put it on the desk.

238
00:13:58,501 --> 00:14:01,405
- Does any of this stuff mean anything?
- I don't know. Ask me later.

239
00:14:01,673 --> 00:14:03,225
You think he's a genius or a whack-job?

240
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,303
I think we answered that question
when we assigned

241
00:14:05,313 --> 00:14:06,221
100 agents to the case.

242
00:14:06,259 --> 00:14:08,139
So why don't you go and get
me the rest of it?

243
00:14:08,178 --> 00:14:09,487
Does that work for you?

244
00:14:42,055 --> 00:14:43,818
Lucky day!

245
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:46,494
I just found me
an in-betweener.

246
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:50,278
Where you going
in such a hurry?

247
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:52,200
None of your beeswax, yo.

248
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,600
I know where.

249
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,549
Same place as every other man
who was in that room that night.

250
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:59,815
They all coming around here
for a big family reunion

251
00:15:00,057 --> 00:15:01,529
at the Ku Klux Ranch.

252
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:03,225
If they ain't here already.

253
00:15:03,945 --> 00:15:07,090
Ain't no country folk in this town
ever heard of the Double K Ranch.

254
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,604
Seems like you've been misinformed.

255
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:09,815
Indeed there is a Double K.

256
00:15:09,861 --> 00:15:12,052
It's just a matter of who
gets there 1st, all right?

257
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:14,083
The stars are gonna collide
in Tooele, my friend.

258
00:15:14,241 --> 00:15:15,918
You'll need me on your side.

259
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:18,061
This ain't Fox River, all right?

260
00:15:18,157 --> 00:15:19,330
I don't need any...

261
00:15:21,974 --> 00:15:23,168
As you can see...

262
00:15:24,435 --> 00:15:25,952
I need you.

263
00:15:27,696 --> 00:15:30,738
Get your grubby paws
off me, you freak.

264
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,717
- I ain't your ditch digger.
- I don't need...

265
00:15:33,712 --> 00:15:34,961
You might...

266
00:15:35,808 --> 00:15:38,940
...if a man knew where
he was supposed to be looking.

267
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,438
Are you having
the Hector Avila

268
00:15:56,496 --> 00:15:58,300
and Maricruz Delgado wedding today?

269
00:15:59,116 --> 00:16:00,199
Avila.

270
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:02,000
No? Okay, thanks.

271
00:16:09,391 --> 00:16:11,661
Hi. Are you having the
Hector Avila

272
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:13,641
and Maricruz Delgado
wedding today?

273
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,176
Avila.

274
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,836
Delgado.

275
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:20,612
Really?

276
00:16:21,966 --> 00:16:22,972
When?

277
00:16:34,204 --> 00:16:36,499
Stay calm. We'll be out in ten minutes.

278
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:39,537
One at a time.

279
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,070
Clear.

280
00:16:41,937 --> 00:16:42,958
Back up.

281
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:48,144
Are you wearing a watch?

282
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,661
Yeah.

283
00:17:03,102 --> 00:17:04,157
Nice day.

284
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:07,821
Thanks.

285
00:17:17,382 --> 00:17:19,259
This is exactly
what we need.

286
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,377
It's a map

287
00:17:20,776 --> 00:17:22,175
of every parcel of land.

288
00:17:22,252 --> 00:17:24,217
Topography, buildings...

289
00:17:24,332 --> 00:17:25,500
everything.

290
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:31,458
Karl Kokosing. Double K.

291
00:17:31,566 --> 00:17:33,592
I don't like the way
this guy is looking at us.

292
00:17:43,545 --> 00:17:44,648
1213.

293
00:17:47,958 --> 00:17:49,360
Where's 1213?

294
00:17:56,357 --> 00:17:58,477
<i>Ms. Sebern, I need to speak with you.</i>

295
00:17:58,542 --> 00:18:00,400
Come on, man, we got to roll now.

296
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,300
<i>Ms. Sebern?</i>

297
00:18:03,918 --> 00:18:05,277
Come on. You got the map?

298
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:10,833
No.

299
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:13,868
Someone else does.

300
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Someone got here before us.
That's the only explanation.

301
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,242
Son of a bitch
is still alive.

302
00:18:34,058 --> 00:18:35,342
Hey, pretty!

303
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,095
What are you going to do, scream?

304
00:18:40,918 --> 00:18:41,784
How the hell...

305
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,553
you are still breathing?

306
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:45,834
What the hell did you do
to your hand?

307
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,286
Easy, easy...

308
00:18:50,052 --> 00:18:51,999
I recently had some work done.

309
00:18:52,501 --> 00:18:53,700
Where's the map?!

310
00:18:55,783 --> 00:18:58,619
Easy... I don't have it.

311
00:18:58,781 --> 00:19:00,534
- Well, where is it?
- I'm telling you,

312
00:19:00,611 --> 00:19:01,844
I don't have it.

313
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,938
- Don't have it, huh?
- You were there. We saw you.

314
00:19:05,284 --> 00:19:06,836
It was gone
when I got there.

315
00:19:06,874 --> 00:19:08,837
Now why don't you keep
your pooch away from me.

316
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:10,285
I'll tell you everything I know.

317
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,672
It's the kid. He has it.

318
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,956
I saw him this morning

319
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:19,318
and I needed some help.

320
00:19:19,385 --> 00:19:20,871
We made a deal, all right?

321
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:22,619
He said that he would dig.

322
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,399
I told him where we could get a map.

323
00:19:25,536 --> 00:19:26,808
What kid?

324
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,983
What kid?

325
00:19:43,427 --> 00:19:45,739
The best thing
to do is nothing.

326
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:47,607
That's how I'm gonna get
the U. S. Senate

327
00:19:47,646 --> 00:19:49,437
to confirm my Vice-Presidency,
do nothing?

328
00:19:49,474 --> 00:19:51,100
Shows them you can do the job.

329
00:19:53,881 --> 00:19:55,200
It's my daughter.

330
00:19:56,371 --> 00:19:58,557
Sir, we need to talk
about your daughter.

331
00:19:59,139 --> 00:20:00,319
What about her?

332
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,253
Well, the media is all over this
Fox River situation.

333
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:04,543
We think it would be best

334
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:06,562
if you could distance yourself
from her...

335
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,194
If I hear this one more time...

336
00:20:08,252 --> 00:20:10,216
I paid her bail,
I walked away.

337
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,803
I have distanced myself.

338
00:20:16,266 --> 00:20:17,800
Give me a minute.

339
00:20:21,305 --> 00:20:22,470
Hey, Dad, it's me.

340
00:20:23,282 --> 00:20:24,840
When you get a chance, I really need

341
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:26,408
to talk to you about some things.

342
00:20:28,257 --> 00:20:29,541
Actually a lot of things.

343
00:20:30,576 --> 00:20:32,477
The most important one is that...

344
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,068
I owe you an apology. I...

345
00:20:36,466 --> 00:20:39,172
I realize that I've made
things difficult for you lately...

346
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,121
...and I want
to take responsibility for that.

347
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:49,825
Call me back. Bye.

348
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:54,766
Hi. I know I'm early,
but I brought dinner.

349
00:20:54,825 --> 00:20:55,885
Come on in.

350
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:57,909
- You're not a vegetarian, are you?
- No.

351
00:20:58,024 --> 00:20:59,623
Just shut that behind you.

352
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:14,007
- You mind if I check my e-mail?
- No, not at all. Here.

353
00:21:14,037 --> 00:21:16,260
- You're so kind. Thank you.
- Absolutely.

354
00:21:39,454 --> 00:21:41,597
Do you happen to have a pen
handy?

355
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,666
Yeah.

356
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,381
Thank you so much.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

357
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:47,755
No. Look, I have a
little pencil and a pad.

358
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:48,950
Thank you.

359
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:57,295
Sir?

360
00:21:58,402 --> 00:21:59,175
Yeah?

361
00:21:59,212 --> 00:22:00,639
There's no Sherry in Cheyenne.

362
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:02,955
Your ticket is not valid
for travel.

363
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:04,323
Oh, well, hold on now.

364
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,422
That can't be right.
That can't be right.

365
00:22:06,468 --> 00:22:08,066
- Excuse me for a second.
- Sure.

366
00:22:10,494 --> 00:22:13,322
All right now, listen, brother.
I'm gonna give it to you straight.

367
00:22:13,924 --> 00:22:15,850
Listen, I'm broke, okay?

368
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:17,198
That's the truth.

369
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:21,087
And I just ran into some trouble
a while back and...

370
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:24,640
I'm just really trying
to pull it all together now.

371
00:22:24,684 --> 00:22:25,619
You understand?

372
00:22:25,649 --> 00:22:28,703
You can tell it all to the authorities
in about five minutes.

373
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:31,508
Oh, come on, brother.
We don't have to get the authorities...

374
00:22:31,563 --> 00:22:32,757
It's too late.

375
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,983
They're already waiting
at the next stop.

376
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:36,272
These guys here,

377
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,747
they're gonna sit with you
until we stop.

378
00:22:40,571 --> 00:22:42,785
I understand. I understand.

379
00:22:53,313 --> 00:22:54,782
Hey, you can't go in there!

380
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,786
Okay, we've got a confirmed
sighting on Franklin.

381
00:23:18,863 --> 00:23:21,740
Jumped out of a moving train
in Preston, Idaho.

382
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:25,140
What is a black man
from Chicago doing in Idaho?

383
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,580
He's gotta be lost.

384
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:27,948
Franklin's in Preston, Idaho,

385
00:23:28,025 --> 00:23:29,084
Bagwell's in Nebraska,

386
00:23:29,142 --> 00:23:31,359
and both men have never been
across the Mississippi.

387
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:33,786
Visiting friends and family?
I don't think so.

388
00:23:33,882 --> 00:23:34,922
And not...

389
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:36,554
south of the border.

390
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:38,866
They're due west and we need to know...

391
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,127
why.

392
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:45,022
Out.

393
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:49,832
- What's going on, friends?
- Where was Tweener headed?

394
00:23:49,871 --> 00:23:52,394
Up on the main drag.
He was supposed to find a shovel.

395
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:00,813
- In.
- No.

396
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:02,764
- No, no, no.
- In!

397
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:10,450
You're coming back, right?

398
00:24:10,508 --> 00:24:11,702
You're coming back?!

399
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,293
Yep.

400
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:14,520
Hey, you guys!

401
00:24:17,354 --> 00:24:19,474
Come on, man,
I'm gonna help you here!

402
00:24:31,062 --> 00:24:33,219
I was on my ATV, and I was hauling ass.

403
00:24:33,277 --> 00:24:35,473
I was right on her tail,
and I pulled out my gun

404
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,340
and blam! That bitch treed herself,

405
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:38,881
and I brought her down in one shot.

406
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:41,050
- What'd she weigh?
- Least a hunny.

407
00:24:41,339 --> 00:24:42,475
Maybe one-ten.

408
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:43,970
Come on out and see us if you want.

409
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:46,659
- It's gonna be a good time.
- Yeah, I just might do that.

410
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,862
Hey, now, what you digging?

411
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,274
Some stuff in my grandpa's yard.

412
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:05,234
We got a bigger one in the back
if you're going deep.

413
00:25:06,177 --> 00:25:07,641
No,
this will do.

414
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:12,184
Damn it if I don't know you
from somewhere.

415
00:25:13,317 --> 00:25:14,704
Maybe I know your grandpa.

416
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:17,587
I doubt it, man.
He moved here, like, a month ago, so...

417
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,339
What's his name?

418
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:22,240
His name's Grandpa.

419
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,682
A'ight? Look, man,
can you just ring this up?

420
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,972
I gotta get out of here.

421
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,140
Sure thing, fella.

422
00:25:27,891 --> 00:25:29,028
I'll ring it up.

423
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:30,338
I'll ring it right now.

424
00:25:34,656 --> 00:25:36,589
I know where I seen you on the TV.

425
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,814
You're one of them Fox River boys.

426
00:25:58,384 --> 00:25:59,810
You got it wrong, man.

427
00:26:00,079 --> 00:26:01,601
No, I think I got it right.

428
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,910
We're closed!

429
00:26:15,536 --> 00:26:16,542
Sorry, bud.

430
00:26:17,712 --> 00:26:19,060
Closing up early today.

431
00:26:21,256 --> 00:26:22,662
Hold on.

432
00:26:23,588 --> 00:26:24,629
Stay right there.

433
00:26:33,828 --> 00:26:36,911
You're going down, just like
your buddy, you son of a bitch.

434
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,282
Where's the kid?

435
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,118
Where's the kid?!

436
00:26:45,622 --> 00:26:46,925
He's back here.

437
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:48,300
Get up.

438
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:54,036
Come on, tough guy.

439
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:55,810
Let's go.

440
00:27:36,803 --> 00:27:38,828
Maricruz.
Baby, open up.

441
00:27:40,115 --> 00:27:41,136
Theresa!

442
00:27:41,945 --> 00:27:43,810
It's me. It's me, okay?

443
00:27:45,261 --> 00:27:47,124
Fernando, what are you doing here?

444
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,410
You can't be here.

445
00:27:48,446 --> 00:27:49,641
I know, Theresa. I just got...

446
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,472
Where's your sister?
I need to see Maricruz.

447
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,667
She's getting her picture taken
with my mom and dad.

448
00:27:53,742 --> 00:27:56,223
- The wedding's at 2:30.
- I need to see her now.

449
00:27:56,499 --> 00:27:57,410
You have to go.

450
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,593
She's the mother of my kid, Theresa.

451
00:27:59,895 --> 00:28:00,936
Please.

452
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,159
You don't want her to marry Hector,
do you? Do you?

453
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,910
I'll go see if I can go get her.

454
00:28:11,438 --> 00:28:12,907
- Wait in here.
- Okay.

455
00:28:27,057 --> 00:28:28,675
Lance, I got a question for you.

456
00:28:29,215 --> 00:28:30,231
Yes?

457
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,437
You know who I am?

458
00:28:37,114 --> 00:28:39,503
I happened to see the
news last night, yes.

459
00:28:41,863 --> 00:28:44,653
Hey, I don't care. I've got
some skeletons in my closet, too.

460
00:28:44,826 --> 00:28:46,325
One of them wears a dress.

461
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,321
Thank you.

462
00:28:49,668 --> 00:28:51,199
I appreciate your lack of judgment.

463
00:28:51,295 --> 00:28:52,309
From what I can tell,

464
00:28:52,847 --> 00:28:54,070
you didn't do anything wrong,

465
00:28:54,111 --> 00:28:56,864
but it's none of my business.
And you don't need to talk about it.

466
00:28:57,010 --> 00:28:58,365
The whole thing just...

467
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,079
I never meant for it to happen.

468
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:08,810
Okay, you do not need
to answer this question.

469
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:12,331
But were you and that guy, like...

470
00:29:17,353 --> 00:29:19,665
You're right,
I don't want to talk about it.

471
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:24,692
- You done?
- Yeah.

472
00:29:25,868 --> 00:29:27,602
Does it worry you that he's...

473
00:29:28,408 --> 00:29:29,429
out there?

474
00:29:32,553 --> 00:29:33,670
Give me one second.

475
00:29:44,087 --> 00:29:45,031
Dad.

476
00:29:45,416 --> 00:29:46,710
Sara, hi.

477
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,909
I got your message.

478
00:29:48,719 --> 00:29:50,183
Dad, please, come in.

479
00:29:54,118 --> 00:29:56,371
Lance,
this is, my father Frank.

480
00:29:57,153 --> 00:29:58,210
How do you do?

481
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,610
Dad, this is my friend Lance.

482
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,910
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I voted for you.

483
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:03,510
Well, thank you. I appreciate that.

484
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:05,609
Sara, I can take off.

485
00:30:05,752 --> 00:30:06,889
No, no need.

486
00:30:07,673 --> 00:30:08,910
It'll only take a minute.

487
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,355
How about you step into my office

488
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,103
- and you make yourself at home.
- Sure.

489
00:30:22,527 --> 00:30:23,610
<i>So...</i>

490
00:30:25,359 --> 00:30:26,534
So, in my program...

491
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,381
we've been talking a lot
about making amends,

492
00:30:29,423 --> 00:30:31,812
and I've been thinking a lot about...

493
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,781
about some of

494
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,510
the choices I've made lately,

495
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:39,310
and I know that that affects you.

496
00:30:41,734 --> 00:30:42,967
<i>and...</i>

497
00:30:44,414 --> 00:30:46,653
<i>and I... I wanted to tell you</i>

498
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,810
that I'm sorry.

499
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:50,210
You don't have to say you're sorry.

500
00:30:50,577 --> 00:30:51,695
Yeah, I do.

501
00:30:51,926 --> 00:30:54,410
And it must be hard to understand

502
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:55,643
why I did it.

503
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,882
<i>I had no idea that I was</i>

504
00:31:00,868 --> 00:31:02,775
<i>putting these guys
back out on the street.</i>

505
00:31:02,832 --> 00:31:05,369
<i>I thought I was saving the life
of an innocent man and...</i>

506
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:08,890
And I know that you didn't read
the information

507
00:31:08,967 --> 00:31:12,318
I gave you on Lincoln Burrows,
but he is innocent and...

508
00:31:12,565 --> 00:31:14,810
a lot of the people involved
right now are dead.

509
00:31:21,395 --> 00:31:22,551
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

510
00:31:22,744 --> 00:31:24,477
<i>This isn't why I called you.</i>

511
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,624
I'm fine...

512
00:31:29,122 --> 00:31:30,432
but I'm scared.

513
00:31:33,329 --> 00:31:34,407
Sara...

514
00:31:35,366 --> 00:31:37,003
I'm gonna help you through this.

515
00:31:37,806 --> 00:31:39,809
We're gonna get through this together.

516
00:31:41,746 --> 00:31:42,995
Thank you.

517
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:44,453
I promise.

518
00:31:47,804 --> 00:31:48,690
Kellerman.

519
00:31:48,717 --> 00:31:50,041
<i>We ran that trace you requested.</i>

520
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,005
What'd you get?

521
00:31:51,052 --> 00:31:52,309
<i>The line is disconnected.</i>

522
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:53,810
Whose was it?

523
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:55,290
<i>Apparently, no one's.</i>

524
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:56,707
What does that mean?

525
00:31:56,776 --> 00:31:58,971
<i>It's been out of service for 17 years.</i>

526
00:32:05,775 --> 00:32:06,796
Fernando.

527
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:09,221
Where is she?

528
00:32:09,262 --> 00:32:10,974
Calm down. Calm down.

529
00:32:11,561 --> 00:32:13,610
She's gonna come down and talk to you.

530
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,410
She's on her way down right now.

531
00:32:18,450 --> 00:32:19,912
You and I got history.

532
00:32:20,681 --> 00:32:21,754
We're family.

533
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:24,665
And out of respect for that,
I'm gonna let her make her own decision.

534
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,930
I'm not leaving without her.

535
00:32:25,969 --> 00:32:27,471
That's for Maricruz to decide.

536
00:32:27,525 --> 00:32:29,529
You've been filling her head
with all this crap.

537
00:32:29,543 --> 00:32:30,947
She's a smart girl.

538
00:32:31,261 --> 00:32:32,771
I personally don't think she's gonna

539
00:32:32,810 --> 00:32:35,195
want to live her life on the run,
but we'll see.

540
00:32:35,233 --> 00:32:36,539
You know, she doesn't love you.

541
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,234
I don't want to get into that right now.

542
00:32:38,235 --> 00:32:39,751
You're not raising my kid.

543
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,685
<i>¿Tu me estas entendiendo?</i>

544
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,999
That don't sound good, cuz.

545
00:32:53,078 --> 00:32:54,110
Maricruz!

546
00:32:54,813 --> 00:32:56,944
- Baby! Mari! Where is she?
- You have to go.

547
00:32:57,002 --> 00:32:59,154
- Where is she?
- Please, Fernando, they're coming!

548
00:32:59,182 --> 00:33:01,509
Did you tell her I was here? Did you?!

549
00:33:05,311 --> 00:33:06,310
Maricruz...

550
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,403
Mahone.

551
00:33:40,553 --> 00:33:41,805
I'll be right down.

552
00:33:48,488 --> 00:33:49,710
Mr. Mahone.

553
00:33:50,182 --> 00:33:51,280
Where are they?

554
00:33:51,388 --> 00:33:53,274
Had a hard time getting
my hands on these.

555
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:54,700
It'd be easier to go to a doctor,

556
00:33:54,757 --> 00:33:56,772
tell him you need something
to calm your nerves.

557
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:59,386
Doctors take notes.
That's why I have a deal with you.

558
00:33:59,444 --> 00:34:02,131
The way things been going,
I thought maybe our deal was over.

559
00:34:02,207 --> 00:34:03,980
You don't ask me about Shales no more.

560
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:05,636
That part of our deal is over.

561
00:34:05,722 --> 00:34:07,629
I no longer need an informant
on the case.

562
00:34:07,825 --> 00:34:10,502
Thought that's all you cared about
was finding him.

563
00:34:11,346 --> 00:34:12,425
You can't get them all.

564
00:34:12,463 --> 00:34:14,447
If you want, I can keep an ear
out on the street.

565
00:34:14,505 --> 00:34:16,207
Midazolam.
1,500 milligrams every 30 days.

566
00:34:16,265 --> 00:34:17,610
That's all I want from you.

567
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,810
We understand each other?

568
00:34:23,096 --> 00:34:24,502
You gonna pay me for it?

569
00:34:28,653 --> 00:34:29,847
Right there.

570
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,231
What are you doing here?

571
00:34:35,315 --> 00:34:36,643
We had to come for you, buddy.

572
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:38,202
How'd you know?

573
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,238
T- Bag.

574
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:41,330
Hand over the map.

575
00:34:41,656 --> 00:34:42,809
- What?
- The map.

576
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:44,116
Hand it over.

577
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:47,743
He told you I had it?

578
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,030
We are going to sort this out
right now.

579
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:12,691
Tell me that's not what I know it is.

580
00:35:13,881 --> 00:35:14,979
It is.

581
00:35:15,056 --> 00:35:17,367
But don't worry, before I destroyed it

582
00:35:17,548 --> 00:35:19,744
I committed it to
my photographic memory.

583
00:35:19,782 --> 00:35:21,150
Coming from a compulsive liar,

584
00:35:21,208 --> 00:35:22,672
I find that a little hard to believe.

585
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:25,505
I'da tattooed it to my body
but I didn't have the time.

586
00:35:26,191 --> 00:35:27,867
Whenever you strip search a lifer,

587
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:29,761
you should always check his coin purse.

588
00:35:30,517 --> 00:35:32,078
Tell us where the money is.

589
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:35,690
Now let's not dissolve
into threats, all right?

590
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:37,445
I'm going to take the high road here

591
00:35:37,464 --> 00:35:39,409
and suggest a mutually
beneficial arrangement.

592
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,162
I have the information,

593
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,877
you have the manual requirements

594
00:35:42,896 --> 00:35:46,238
necessary to unearth
Westmoreland's buried booty.

595
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:47,355
We're partners.

596
00:35:47,369 --> 00:35:48,487
And why is that?

597
00:35:48,526 --> 00:35:49,937
'Cause as of this moment,

598
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,430
I'm your map.

599
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,930
So then, yo, we split it four ways,
right?

600
00:36:00,765 --> 00:36:02,094
Wrong. Get in.

601
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,394
You're not worth 1.5.

602
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:06,877
- Get in.
- Okay.

603
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:33,400
Excuse me. Can I help you?

604
00:36:35,048 --> 00:36:37,494
Oh. Yeah.
Sorry, yeah.

605
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:41,730
It's hot.

606
00:36:44,365 --> 00:36:46,867
I was really wondering
how much you selling your RV for.

607
00:36:47,618 --> 00:36:49,380
Probably out of your price range.

608
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,079
Come on, give me a shot.

609
00:36:51,623 --> 00:36:52,972
$40,000.

610
00:36:59,574 --> 00:37:00,961
Look, I tell you what.

611
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,851
I'll be back in a couple days, okay?

612
00:37:03,514 --> 00:37:04,901
I can't hold it for you.

613
00:37:05,941 --> 00:37:07,193
I said I'll be back.

614
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,330
With cash.

615
00:37:27,935 --> 00:37:29,130
Nice bike.

616
00:37:38,715 --> 00:37:40,429
<i>The wedding's at 2:30, Fernando.</i>

617
00:37:44,176 --> 00:37:46,545
We just got confirmation
on Fernando Sucre.

618
00:37:46,584 --> 00:37:48,317
He was in Las Vegas around 2:00.

619
00:37:48,375 --> 00:37:49,974
Then a gas station attendant

620
00:37:50,032 --> 00:37:52,899
spotted a guy on a bike
matching his description

621
00:37:53,015 --> 00:37:55,076
in Mesquite...

622
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:56,691
an hour

623
00:37:57,289 --> 00:37:58,296
later.

624
00:37:58,992 --> 00:38:01,230
Out west, just like
Bagwell and Franklin.

625
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:03,041
Yeah, but he was heading east.

626
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:05,429
And Bagwell's in Nebraska
on I-80 heading west.

627
00:38:05,467 --> 00:38:08,314
And Franklin's train was heading west,
but he jumped off to the...

628
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:10,479
sou...

629
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:16,721
You know D. B. Cooper?

630
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:18,470
- Yeah, that hijacker.
- Hijacker.

631
00:38:18,526 --> 00:38:19,529
But he was never found.

632
00:38:19,568 --> 00:38:22,253
Yeah, but he's got to be somewhere,
right, because someone hijacked

633
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:24,969
that plane in Portland and jumped out
over the Pacific Northwest.

634
00:38:25,026 --> 00:38:27,030
And someone was arrested two days later

635
00:38:27,068 --> 00:38:29,168
in Bisbee, Arizona.

636
00:38:29,283 --> 00:38:30,651
- Not the same guy.
- Same guy.

637
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,981
Same guy who was treated
for a broken knee

638
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:35,364
in a free clinic somewhere
around Salt Lake City.

639
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:37,367
Same guy whose Nova blew a head gasket

640
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,633
ten miles short of the border.

641
00:38:38,687 --> 00:38:40,400
Same guy who almost got away

642
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:41,748
with a stolen car,

643
00:38:42,092 --> 00:38:43,787
but he ran a woman down in Bisbee.

644
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,290
Vehicular manslaughter.

645
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:49,427
Arrested and booked
as Charles Westmoreland.

646
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,230
But he didn't have the money on him.

647
00:38:52,414 --> 00:38:53,685
Which means,

648
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:55,999
he got rid of it somewhere
along the way.

649
00:38:56,036 --> 00:38:58,892
Wait, wait, this is fact?
You figured all this out?

650
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:00,444
No. Scofield did.

651
00:39:00,684 --> 00:39:02,619
That's why he was bringing
the old man along.

652
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,689
The money's in Utah.

653
00:39:03,747 --> 00:39:05,312
And they're all going to get it.

654
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:11,234
<i>You know, in... Thailand</i>

655
00:39:11,311 --> 00:39:12,775
they got a black market

656
00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:14,820
where you can get
any kind of surgery you need,

657
00:39:14,893 --> 00:39:16,230
even a hand transplant.

658
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,215
- You're sick, you know that.
- Keep going.

659
00:39:18,243 --> 00:39:20,222
The turnoff's just up here somewhere.

660
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,887
Before or after Sheep Road?

661
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:26,154
What's the matter,
Theodore, did you forget?

662
00:39:26,182 --> 00:39:28,030
How could I forget a road called Sheep?

663
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,150
It's after.

664
00:39:29,227 --> 00:39:30,604
Don't you feel all warm inside

665
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:32,029
now that we're working together?

666
00:39:32,068 --> 00:39:33,416
We aren't working together.

667
00:39:33,838 --> 00:39:35,398
You're just here to lend a hand.

668
00:39:35,534 --> 00:39:36,810
Now, slow down.

669
00:39:37,238 --> 00:39:39,806
That was it, that little bitty road
right back there.

670
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:04,775
How far is it from here?

671
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:08,165
Quarter mile if I remember
the scale properly.

672
00:40:08,261 --> 00:40:09,632
Start walking.

673
00:40:30,671 --> 00:40:31,682
Frank?

674
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:33,756
Yeah, I'm almost ready.

675
00:40:34,353 --> 00:40:36,029
What time did you say the flight was?

676
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,030
8:00.

677
00:40:37,076 --> 00:40:40,124
Listen, I hope you get this nomination
more than anyone, but...

678
00:40:40,415 --> 00:40:41,542
be prepared.

679
00:40:41,619 --> 00:40:43,330
This Burrows thing may steamroll.

680
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,483
Well, we'll wait it out,
just like you said.

681
00:40:45,942 --> 00:40:47,541
Problem is too many headlines.

682
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:49,767
His lawyer Nick Savrinn's already dead.

683
00:40:50,206 --> 00:40:52,132
His kid's awaiting trial
for double homicide.

684
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,929
and now his lead counsel
is classified as missing.

685
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:57,001
Well, is she missing or is she dead?

686
00:40:58,461 --> 00:41:01,230
I just thought you should know
before you go to Washington.

687
00:41:01,642 --> 00:41:04,130
Bruce, is there something
connecting all of this?

688
00:41:04,391 --> 00:41:07,246
It's probably best you don't ask
a whole lot of questions.

689
00:41:18,083 --> 00:41:19,335
Where now?

690
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:23,374
Right up there.

691
00:41:24,353 --> 00:41:26,163
The hill borders the property.

692
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,907
KK's on the other side.

693
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:31,147
First thing I'm gonna do
with the money?

694
00:41:31,593 --> 00:41:32,710
Buy new shoes.

695
00:41:32,767 --> 00:41:34,019
Second thing: tacos.

696
00:41:34,097 --> 00:41:34,873
Third thing:

697
00:41:35,373 --> 00:41:36,545
ice cold beer.

698
00:41:36,675 --> 00:41:37,668
Fourth thing:

699
00:41:37,985 --> 00:41:39,442
a little toothpaste.

700
00:41:41,105 --> 00:41:42,396
Oh, damn!

701
00:41:56,224 --> 00:41:57,230
Mahone.

702
00:41:57,273 --> 00:41:59,479
<i>Agent Mahone, your car's out front, sir.</i>

703
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,062
<i>The flight to Utah leaves in an hour.</i>

704
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:02,152
I'll be there.

705
00:42:02,427 --> 00:42:03,434
Thank you.

706
00:42:29,936 --> 00:42:30,937
Ninth thing:

707
00:42:31,171 --> 00:42:32,192
a shower.

708
00:42:32,699 --> 00:42:34,818
Tenth thing: a good night's sleep.

709
00:42:35,385 --> 00:42:36,584
A nice hotel.

710
00:42:36,805 --> 00:42:37,798
Clean sheets.

711
00:42:37,961 --> 00:42:40,234
Look, stakes marking the property line.

712
00:42:40,302 --> 00:42:41,995
Should be dead ahead.

713
00:42:43,277 --> 00:42:44,837
Can you see the silo?

714
00:42:51,492 --> 00:42:53,264
The bastards built over it.

715
00:42:56,092 --> 00:42:57,344
It's gone.
