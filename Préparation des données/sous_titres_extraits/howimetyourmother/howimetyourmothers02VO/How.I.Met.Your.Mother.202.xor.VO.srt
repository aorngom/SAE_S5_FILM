1
00:00:00,913 --> 00:00:03,880
Com had been together
for nine wonderful years,

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:06,849
until she dumped him and
ran off to san francisco.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,029
The healing process was taking a long time.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:14,169
then, one night, he made
a giant leap forward.

5
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:15,937
All right, I'll see you guys later.

6
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:18,557
- I'll walk you out.
- See ya.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,824
You just checked out robin's ass.

8
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,029
What? No!N-no, barney, I was...

9
00:00:27,049 --> 00:00:28,844
dude, that's awesome.

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,529
You're finally forgetting
about that short redhead.

11
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:33,864
- Lily.
- Yes, lily.Thank you.

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,779
That was going to drive me crazy all night.

13
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:37,889
Hey, ted, marshall just checked
out your girlfriend's ass.

14
00:00:37,925 --> 00:00:40,769
- I did not, ted, I...
- that's awesome.

15
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,149
You're finally getting better.

16
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,155
This is the moment I've been waiting for.

17
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:47,449
Starting tonight, I am going
to teach you how to live.

18
00:00:47,485 --> 00:00:48,476
Ted, you had your chance.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,469
You're out; marshall's in.

20
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,762
- Yes!
- Oh, god.

21
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:54,549
Marshall, being a single guy
in new york city is like...

22
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:57,019
what's something everybody likes?

23
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:57,979
Candy.

24
00:00:58,015 --> 00:01:00,694
Yes, it's like being in a candy store.

25
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,659
You just walk right in and
grab yourself some whoppers.

26
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,599
yeah.

27
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:08,091
Is whoppers the best one?

28
00:01:08,127 --> 00:01:08,969
Mounds.

29
00:01:09,005 --> 00:01:10,431
Milk dudS.

30
00:01:10,432 --> 00:01:11,963
Gobstoppers.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,419
This went on for another hour;
I'll just skip to the end.

32
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,219
Dubble bubbles.

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,512
Nice!

34
00:01:18,548 --> 00:01:20,204
Marshall. We're doing this.

35
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,549
- I am not taking no for an answer.
- Fine.

36
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:24,480
hey, robin.

37
00:01:24,515 --> 00:01:25,429
Marshall checked out your ass.

38
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,109
Ted, what is wrong with you?

39
00:01:27,110 --> 00:01:28,889
He checked out my ass.

40
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:32,419
Hey, tell him thanks.I felt
like I was having a bad ass day.

41
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,722
Cool, see ya.

42
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,879
Lily.

43
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,329
It is a great ass.

47
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:57,109
******In three months.

48
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,989
There were so many unanswered
questions, so many things to say.

49
00:02:01,025 --> 00:02:03,689
Your hair is adorable.

50
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,659
meanwhile, barney was taking marshall out to
meet women for the first time since he was 17.

51
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,389
Hi.Have you met marshall?

52
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,986
- Hi.
- Hi.

53
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,709
Look how sweaty my hands are.

54
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:22,834
It's weird, right? Uh, sweat?

55
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:27,149
Like, this smelly water
coming out of your skin.

56
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,639
It was nice meeting you.

57
00:02:30,675 --> 00:02:35,099
I- I-I hate to interrupt,
but, uh, do you like magic?

58
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,409
Um, I guess.

59
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,099
oh, my god!

60
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:48,149
anyway, marshall here is awesome.

61
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,589
Salad in a bag? His idea.

62
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:52,114
Dude!

63
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:53,449
You were awesome last night.

64
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,849
You were charming, you were funny,
you were totally working that girl.

65
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:58,449
You went home with her.

66
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:00,039
Yes, I did.

67
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:03,539
But she told me that if it wasn't for me,

68
00:03:03,575 --> 00:03:04,924
you would have had a shot with her,

69
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:09,069
so, in hypothetical terms, you
scored last night. All right!

70
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:10,859
Hypothetical high five.

71
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,094
Nice.

72
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,839
All right.

73
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,239
Tonight, we're going to go to the bar...

74
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,009
barney, no, I am not going
out with you ever again.

75
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,079
Come on!

76
00:03:20,115 --> 00:03:22,005
I'll, I'll teach you all of my strategies.

77
00:03:22,006 --> 00:03:22,834
Oh, really?

78
00:03:22,877 --> 00:03:26,744
My favorite, number seven:
Create a mystery about yourself.

79
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:30,439
That way, they become so intrigued,
they have to hang out with you all night.

80
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:32,749
Oh, come on, does that really work?

81
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,509
Maybe it does, and maybe it doesn'T.

82
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,349
Damn it, that's intriguing.

83
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:40,689
Okay, I'm in.

84
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:46,079
- I have something you've got to hear.
- You will not believe what just happened.

85
00:03:46,084 --> 00:03:47,639
You go first.

86
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:51,474
I found a 1939 penny on the subway.

87
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:54,360
Just imagine the kind of
history this little copper guy...

88
00:03:54,361 --> 00:03:56,150
lily's back in town.

89
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,834
And you let me go first?

90
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,669
- Have you seen her?
- Uh, yeah.

91
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,179
I actually went
apartment-hunting with her today.

92
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,539
How's she doing?

93
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,349
You're not going to like it.

94
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,065
I am doing great.

95
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,074
This summer, best thing ever!

96
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,939
San francisco is so happening right now.

97
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,359
She's happy?!

98
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,569
Marshall had the worst summer
of his life, and she's happy.

99
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:23,349
Yeah, and I suppose her art program
was all fulfilling or whatever.

100
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:24,619
Oh.The art program...

101
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,729
best thing ever.

102
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,639
Oh, my god.

103
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,834
This is your best work.

104
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:34,429
In all my years
teaching, I've never seen anything so...

105
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,659
needless to say, this is art.

106
00:04:39,928 --> 00:04:42,219
I can't teach you anything.

107
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,519
but the best part of S.F.

108
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,669
Oh, that's what we call san francisco...

109
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,749
the people.

110
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,069
Even just riding around
on the bus all summer.

111
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:56,339
It was like a human tapestry.

112
00:04:56,910 --> 00:04:58,004
Hi, I'm mike.

113
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,979
I'm a buddhist monk slash
adventure-traveler writer.

114
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,809
I'm paula. I sing in a
punk band for children.

115
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,129
Yeah.

116
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,094
I'm dan, I'm a neurosurgeon.

117
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:09,929
You are stunning, by the way.

118
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,534
I'm so happy for you.

119
00:05:15,569 --> 00:05:18,029
Oh, she's such A...

120
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,440
after what she did to marshall, she
should come back here devastated,

121
00:05:22,441 --> 00:05:26,279
crawling on all fours over the broken
glass of her own shame and regret.

122
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,629
You never chose sides.

123
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:28,669
I respect that.

124
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,329
She's unbelievable. Unbelievable.

125
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,479
Unbelievable?

126
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,869
What's unbelievable?

127
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,254
Listen, marshall.

128
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:37,969
Ted found a penny on the subway,
and it's old, and that's interesting.

129
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,729
Way to go.

130
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,099
Okay, first of all, that is interesting.

131
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,944
Second, we have to tell him.

132
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,519
No, we don'T.He's just starting to
get better, going out with barney.

133
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,889
I mean, how do you think he's going
to feel when he hears lily's moved on?

134
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:59,329
- She's moved on?
- It happens.

135
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,423
I've fallen out of love
faster than that before,

136
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,929
sometimes, boom, with
no warning whatsoever.

137
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,729
One day we're in love, the
next day, he's dead to me.

138
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,619
But we're great. Honey.

139
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,489
Now, let's review barney's
rules for mating without dating.

140
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:19,519
Lesson two, corollary five.

141
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,729
Make a beautiful woman feel self-conscious and
unattractive, and she'll be putty in your hands.

142
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,889
Excellent.

143
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,969
- Have you chosen your entree?
- I have.

144
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:30,019
Sweet brunette, eight o'clock.

145
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:30,929
Nine o'clock.

146
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:33,528
Ten... thirty. She's walking to the bar.

147
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,510
- Her? Really?
- Yeah.

148
00:06:36,511 --> 00:06:37,474
No, you're right.

149
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,669
Ambition is the enemy of success.

150
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,629
Okay.Hit it.

151
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,774
what's the matter, four eyes,
you got astigmatism or something?

152
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:50,989
I'm sorry, I was trying to playfully disarm
you, but I just got out of a long relationship.

153
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,489
I have no idea what I'm doing.

154
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,390
- I'm marshall.
- Hi, marshall. Amy.

155
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,395
Don't worry. I've been there.

156
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,289
Hold on.

157
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:02,999
Nice recovery. I think it's working.

158
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,584
Um, amy.This is my friend,
barney.Barney, this is amy.

159
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,889
- Hi, barney.Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

160
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:15,359
Amy, do you like... magic?

161
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,719
- I hate you.
- I am so sorry.

162
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,554
It's a sickness.

163
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,179
I'm the real victim here.

164
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:26,487
Twice. Twice in a row, you took
my candy. That was my candy.

165
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:29,509
- I know, but tonight...
- no.Forget it.

166
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,119
You're such a jackass.

167
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,679
I thought you were gonna call me a jerk.

168
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,420
All right, I'm sorry.I
will make it up to you.

169
00:07:40,421 --> 00:07:45,169
Tonight, we'll go to a college bar
near nyu- the scorpion and the toad.

170
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,078
I figure in a younger crowd you'll
seem more mature, more worldly and,

171
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:52,059
as a third-year law
student, more smarter.

172
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,509
Okay, but no magic.

173
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,884
How did you do that?

174
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,389
I'm taking a leak, dumb ass.

175
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,069
Robin and I met lily outside the
next apartment she was seeing.*******

176
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:12,759
But I need the freedom to really chase my passion,

177
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,809
which was painting, but now I think
it's music or spoken word- maybe both.

178
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:18,949
God!Isn't life amazing?

179
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,279
It is so great to see you, ted.

180
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,949
I'm going to get the key from the lockbox.

181
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:28,524
What?

182
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,809
She's miserable.

183
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,459
She's realized she's made a huge mistake.

184
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:33,099
Her and marshall will be
back together in a week.

185
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,969
I love it!

186
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,060
Um, no.You just want lily to be miserable.

187
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:37,319
The truth is, she's happy.

188
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,249
Trust me.I've known lily for nine years.

189
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,540
Trust me.I'm a girl.

190
00:08:40,575 --> 00:08:42,444
Yeah, but you're canadian.

191
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,789
- Why do you always have to bring that up?
- You're our weird neighbors to the north.

192
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,049
You bring it up every time.

193
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,879
All right, five bucks says
she still wants marshall.

194
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,069
You're on.

195
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,704
Five american bucks.

196
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,796
Damn it.

197
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:55,509
Okay, so how do we get the truth out of her.

198
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,684
Tequila.

199
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,659
It's her weakness.

200
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,719
Three shots, she'll tell
you the truth about anything.

201
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,279
I hope this is my new home.

202
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,659
Yeah, I'm going to take
that first apartment.

203
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:13,029
- marshall eriksen, suit up!
- No way.

204
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,769
Yeah, you're good in that.

205
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:16,769
- Let's go.
- wait.

206
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:19,019
Empty your pockets.

207
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,679
Come on.

208
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,239
- Come on, let'S...
- sleeves.

209
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,419
- There is nothing in my...
- oh, is that right?

210
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,929
Let's go.

211
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,180
behind my ear.

212
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:45,309
There is nothing behind your...

213
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:51,304
Yeah, I'm in pre-law.

214
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,779
The workload's killing me, though.

215
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,729
Oh, tell me about it.

216
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:56,279
I'm third year at columbia law, so...

217
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,989
If the workload does kill you,
I can probably get a conviction.

218
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:01,919
yeah.

219
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:07,540
You must be majoring in chemistry, 'cause
what I'm picking up between us is, uh...

220
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,899
college lesbian phase.

221
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:17,569
Listen, I got to go, but it'd
be great to see you again.

222
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,599
Yes, it would.

223
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,289
It really would.

224
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,179
Well, maybe I'll see you here sometime.

225
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,159
Probably not.I'm never here, so...

226
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:30,569
you know, I do have a phone number.

227
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,029
Great.

228
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,059
Nice.

229
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,849
- Hi, I'm barney.
- Oh, no.

230
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:40,709
Do you... mind giving my
friend your phone number?

231
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,119
Sure.

232
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,525
Whoo!

233
00:10:45,725 --> 00:10:48,360
I did it!I got a girl's phone number.

234
00:10:48,395 --> 00:10:50,854
Oh, and her handwriting is so cute, look.

235
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:53,929
Oh, I'm gonna take her out for chinese food
and then maybe we'll walk through the park.

236
00:10:53,930 --> 00:10:56,309
It'll be so... what?

237
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,659
Sorry, buddy, I'm taking this one, too.

238
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,689
I'll kill you!

239
00:11:05,948 --> 00:11:08,438
And then, I discovered
this area, north beach.

240
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,324
Best beach ever!

241
00:11:10,325 --> 00:11:13,530
Oh, I've been blabbering on about my summer.

242
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,251
How are you guys doing?

243
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,833
And hey, how's marshall?

244
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:18,870
- Give me the card!
- I'm not giving you any card.

245
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:20,459
- I swear...!
- You are not getting...!

246
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,299
Terrific.

247
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,775
That is so good to hear.

248
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:24,510
oh, hold on.

249
00:11:24,511 --> 00:11:27,419
This could be about the apartment.

250
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,569
okay, we're way past
truth-telling-lilly and about to hit

251
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,029
cinco-de-mayo-1998-lilly and
I'm not cleaning that up again.

252
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:37,169
So, congratulations, you win.

253
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,269
She's happy.

254
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,729
I didn't get it.

255
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,443
That first apartment,I...

256
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,513
I waited too long and...

257
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,729
somebody else got it.

258
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,539
interesting.

259
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,269
Wow, lily, you, uh... seem to be having a
pretty strong reaction on losing an apartment.

260
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:03,359
I wonder if it's because it reminds you of
something else you lost because you couldn't commit.

261
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:08,069
no, lily, you're crying over the crown
molding and the real hardwood floors.

262
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,639
There's no deeper meaning.

263
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,529
Right, lily?

264
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:12,359
Just quit crying and tell him.

265
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:18,406
the apartment is a metaphor for marshall.

266
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:25,609
stop! You don't want to see
what I'm like when I'm angry.

267
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,859
Hold on!

268
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,699
If we can't settle this like
gentlemen, then no one gets the number.

269
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:33,224
- stop the cab.
- Wha...?

270
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:36,598
no, wait.Come on. Marshall!

271
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,159
81st and first, please.

272
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:45,089
Ah, she does have cute handwriting.

273
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:49,799
The thing about a hangover is that
everyone has their own special remedy.

274
00:12:49,877 --> 00:12:51,487
Waiter: Morning, guys.
What can I get you?

275
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:55,499
Bring me the dirtiest,
greasiest tuna melt you goT.

276
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,989
And a milkshake.

277
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,469
For you, sir?

278
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:00,639
Gravy.

279
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,563
You want that gravy on something?

280
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,149
Surprise me.

281
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,292
I'd take you with gravy if my
boyfriend wasn't sitting right here.

282
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,251
Just kidding.

283
00:13:11,252 --> 00:13:12,130
I'm good.

284
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:15,869
What are you so chirpy about?

285
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,809
She's still drunk from last night.

286
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:19,648
I don't think so.

287
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,304
Look, if you want marshall back so bad, how
come it took you two days to even ask about him?

288
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:30,662
I was dying to ask.

289
00:13:30,662 --> 00:13:33,061
I was just trying to play it cool.

290
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,261
But really...

291
00:13:34,296 --> 00:13:36,149
but it's good, I mean, work is great...

292
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,610
Lily: Come on, say something about marshall.

293
00:13:37,611 --> 00:13:39,950
Where's marshall? How's marshall?
What's marshall doing right now?

294
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:43,679
Shut up and talk about marshall.

295
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,359
Marshall, marshall, marshall,
marshall... I've got to ask!

296
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,479
And hey, how's marshall?

297
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,159
It was such an awful summer.

298
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,619
I just wanted to get back here and see him.

299
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:55,765
But I thought your summer was great.

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,422
Not exactly.

301
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,967
Oh, my god.

302
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,494
This is you best work?

303
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,771
In all my years teaching, I've
never seen anything so needless.

304
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:11,029
To say this is... art...

305
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,949
I can't teach you anything.

306
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,949
So all those interesting
people you met on the bus?

307
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,371
Yeah, um...

308
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,379
I'm mike.

309
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,169
I'm a buddhist monk slash
adventure travel writer.

310
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:29,669
I'm paula.

311
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,939
I sing in a punk band for children.

312
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,450
I'm dan. I'm a neurosurgeon.

313
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,119
You are stunning, by the way.

314
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,890
I never got in touch because
I was too embarrassed.

315
00:14:42,990 --> 00:14:44,690
I screwed everything up.

316
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:46,927
I have no job, no place to live.

317
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,571
I lost the love of my life.

318
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,604
I know I have no right to ask this,

319
00:14:53,605 --> 00:14:56,725
but do you think marshall
would take me back?

320
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:57,689
In a heartbeat.

321
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,909
If you called him up, yeah, he'd
take you back with open arms.

322
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:04,709
So maybe I should call him.

323
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,409
Maybe.

324
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:09,368
No!This is... ow!

325
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,629
Hold on.

326
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,839
Look, if you're going to go back to him,

327
00:15:14,226 --> 00:15:15,802
I don't want to hear the word "maybe.

328
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:17,378
" "Maybe" cannot be in your vocabulary.

329
00:15:17,413 --> 00:15:19,222
This breakup almost killed him.

330
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:21,138
And he cannot go through it again.

331
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:25,880
So, unless you're absolutely
certain, stay the hell away from him.

332
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,961
This guy likes pennies.

333
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,449
Hi, marshall.

334
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,640
No, go away.I don't want to talk to you.

335
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,849
Okay, I know what I did a couple
nights back is in a moral gray area.

336
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,819
But the great news is, she loved you.

337
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,663
If things had gone your way
- you'd gone out a couple times,

338
00:15:49,664 --> 00:15:51,548
I think she definitely
would have had sex with you.

339
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,639
There's no "would" in sex.

340
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:59,539
you're right, I totally... I'm
just no good at this, barney.

341
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:02,786
I'm good at being in a couple,
I'm good at being lily's boyfriend.

342
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,789
Being single- forget it.

343
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:06,099
Come on, you can't give up now.

344
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,348
What if I told you that you could relive
that night with the exact same conversations,

345
00:16:10,348 --> 00:16:14,329
the exact same jokes only this
time, you get her and I don'T.

346
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:15,929
That's not possible.

347
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,429
Oh, but it is.

348
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,469
She has... wait for it...

349
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:26,149
Here it comes...Almost
there... an identical twin.

350
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:27,339
Yes!

351
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,879
A twin isn't the same person.

352
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,689
Of course it is.

353
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:32,109
What do you think identical means?

354
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,949
"Ident"- same, "ical"- person. Same person.

355
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,049
Hey, we could double date.

356
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,718
Fine.

357
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:43,699
But you have to promise me, you're
not going to steal my new twin,

358
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,269
and leave me with your old, used-up twin.

359
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,109
Used up?

360
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,069
They're a human being, marshall.

361
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,099
So uncle marshall and uncle barney went
out on a double date with the twins.

362
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,049
How you doing?

363
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,844
Great. This is so much fun.

364
00:17:03,879 --> 00:17:05,459
And I think me and the
girl are really clicking.

365
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:06,999
You are, you definitely are.

366
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,125
Listen, you're going to have to leave now.

367
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:13,679
I just talked with the twins, and get
this, I'm going home with both of them.

368
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:15,568
Yeah.

369
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:17,393
That's happening.

370
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:20,633
It is impossible that you're
doing this to me again.

371
00:17:20,892 --> 00:17:23,039
But they're twins.

372
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:27,014
You... you said to me that being single
would be like being in a candy store.

373
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,895
Well, it's not, it's not like a candy store.

374
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:32,109
It's a lawless, postapocalyptic wasteland.

375
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:33,879
- I may be your best friend...
- actually ted's my best friend.

376
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,109
But in this world, it's
every hombre for himself.

377
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,649
That's what being single is.

378
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,884
And after nine years in captivity,

379
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:45,692
that is the single greatest lesson I can
teach you about surviving in the wild.

380
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,639
Now, if you'll excuse me...

381
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,609
I have two unique breasts and
two duplicates waiting for me.

382
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,636
oh, bad news
- marshall got food poisoning.

383
00:17:59,637 --> 00:18:00,680
- What?
- Oh, no.

384
00:18:00,715 --> 00:18:02,930
That's too bad.I really liked him.

385
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:03,819
Yeah.

386
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,259
Well, I guess we're
just a threesome tonight.

387
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,799
Lily, what are you doing here?

388
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,432
Oh, oh, I was just walking by.

389
00:18:22,433 --> 00:18:25,630
I wasn'T... oh, you mean new york?

390
00:18:25,631 --> 00:18:26,869
My program ended.

391
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,479
It was just great.

392
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,479
Just lots of fun... it was awful.

393
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,710
It was the worst mistake I ever made.

394
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,809
I'm so sorry, marshall, and... hello.

395
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:41,129
Lily, this was the worst summer of my life.

396
00:18:41,237 --> 00:18:43,801
I know. It was the
worst summer of my life.

397
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,761
It was the hardest thing that
I've ever had to go through.

398
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,503
Can we please get back together?

399
00:18:52,362 --> 00:18:55,219
All that crap you said to me about,

400
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:58,689
"we need to figure out
who we are outside of us,

401
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:01,029
and we need to learn to
do things on our own,"

402
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,484
it broke my heart.

403
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:08,095
Three months ago, you broke my heart.

404
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:13,323
Can we please get back together?

405
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:17,153
Lily, you were right.

406
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,239
All that crap was right.

407
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,438
So, no.

408
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,839
No, we can't get back together.

409
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,499
We shouldn'T.

410
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,419
At least, not right now.

411
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,214
Okay.

412
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,035
Yeah.

413
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:47,269
Well... will we still see each other?

414
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:50,099
Yeah, yeah.

415
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,629
I think so.

416
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,009
I don't know.

417
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,920
This is all really new to me.

418
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:03,071
I just got out of a long relationship.

419
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:08,879
I like your hair.

420
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,899
Thanks.

421
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:16,021
I figured new city, a different color...

422
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:27,451
那里还有匹萨 那是我吃过的最差的匹萨

423
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,729
我真高兴回到了纽约

424
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,189
是呀

425
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:37,979
To even begin to make things up to you...

426
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,529
actually there may be something
that you can do for me,

427
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:46,979
but you can never ever ask me why.

428
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,359
So then I was promoted
to assistant mnage-er...

429
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,609
manager- why do I keep doing that?

430
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:55,889
Lily?

431
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,393
You gave me chlamydia, you jerk.

432
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,589
So where was I?

433
00:21:04,706 --> 00:21:07,391
Ah, yes, assistant
mnage-er... I did it again.

434
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:08,719
I can't believe it.

435
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:12,838
You gave my twin sister chlamydia.

436
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:15,079
You slime!

437
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,549
Wha... wait, I know magic.

438
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,731
Well, played, eriksen.

439
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,317
Well played.
