1
00:00:00,382 --> 00:00:03,929
Kids, sometimes your relationship
goes so smoothly for so long

2
00:00:03,939 --> 00:00:06,143
that you think it will be
that way forever.

3
00:00:06,153 --> 00:00:07,421
It never is.

4
00:00:07,431 --> 00:00:09,739
Well, we just had our first fight.

5
00:00:09,749 --> 00:00:11,186
We had our first fight.

6
00:00:11,196 --> 00:00:12,911
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

7
00:00:12,991 --> 00:00:15,861
Oh, no, what'd you fight about?

8
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,340
A few months ago,
my architecture firm was approached

9
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:22,567
to design this new building...

10
00:00:22,576 --> 00:00:24,820
It's this big skyscraper
in Spokane.

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,599
It'd be a huge project
for his firm.

12
00:00:26,607 --> 00:00:28,693
And if we don't get it,
we could go under.

13
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:31,733
So anyway, the head architect
unveils his new design

14
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:33,160
to the whole company.

15
00:00:39,088 --> 00:00:40,080
- No.
- No.

16
00:00:40,096 --> 00:00:41,212
Yes.

17
00:00:41,228 --> 00:00:44,262
All skyscrapers
kind of look like a...

18
00:00:44,275 --> 00:00:47,963
Marshall,
it's a 78-story pink marble tower

19
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:49,543
with a rounded top

20
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:52,451
and two spherical
entryways at the front.

21
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,363
Wow, so it's the whole package.

22
00:00:54,376 --> 00:00:56,422
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.

23
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:59,111
Oh, dude, if they're selling condos,
you got to get me in.

24
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:00,452
And don't give me the shaft.

25
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:02,301
- Yeah, you did.
- Had to.

26
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:04,602
It's a travesty.

27
00:01:04,616 --> 00:01:06,562
It's gonna define
the skyline of the city.

28
00:01:06,578 --> 00:01:09,100
If it was me, I could've
designed something amazing.

29
00:01:09,118 --> 00:01:12,110
Instead, I'm spending 12 hours
a day designing the cornices.

30
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:14,871
- Yeah, you did.
- That wasn't one.

31
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,571
So you and Ted
had your first fight.

32
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:34,252
It obviously ended well.
I mean, you're here with me.

33
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:36,070
Actually,
it didn't end at all.

34
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:38,172
I started getting bummed out,
so I came here.

35
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:39,170
It's what I do.

36
00:01:39,188 --> 00:01:41,012
When my grandma died,
I got a perm.

37
00:01:41,025 --> 00:01:44,050
Ooh, two tragedies in one day.

38
00:01:45,055 --> 00:01:47,392
The thing is,
Ted has been literally

39
00:01:47,405 --> 00:01:49,820
complaining about work
nonstop for weeks.

40
00:01:49,837 --> 00:01:53,332
So, when I came over today,
I was kind of done.

41
00:01:53,396 --> 00:01:54,691
- Hey.
- Hey.

42
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,693
- How was your day?
- Good.

43
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:00,531
Wow, you're a great interviewer.

44
00:02:00,546 --> 00:02:01,780
Aren't you gonna ask
how my day was?

45
00:02:01,798 --> 00:02:04,422
No, I know how it was.
It was awful.

46
00:02:04,437 --> 00:02:06,731
Ooh, you want to rent
a movie tonight?

47
00:02:06,855 --> 00:02:08,371
You know, um...

48
00:02:08,386 --> 00:02:10,730
I listen to your work
stories all the time.

49
00:02:10,748 --> 00:02:13,330
Yeah, but...
and I don't want to be rude here,

50
00:02:13,348 --> 00:02:15,940
but my work stories
are interesting.

51
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:18,013
I'm a television news reporter.

52
00:02:18,235 --> 00:02:20,091
- Robin...
- What?

53
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,853
I knew exactly
what he was going to say.

54
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:24,561
I was just helping him
get there faster.

55
00:02:24,576 --> 00:02:27,522
You should work
at a suicide hotline.

56
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:29,672
And then it got ugly.

57
00:02:29,685 --> 00:02:33,352
What I don't do is tell you
the same story over and over again.

58
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,252
I mean, you wouldn't
watch the same movie

59
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:37,093
over and over again, would you?

60
00:02:37,107 --> 00:02:40,121
Maybe a great movie
like Die Hard.

61
00:02:40,138 --> 00:02:41,782
But Field of Dreams?

62
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,991
Once is more than enough.

63
00:02:47,068 --> 00:02:49,092
So that's your go-to bad movie?

64
00:02:49,106 --> 00:02:51,092
The number one example
on the tip of your tongue

65
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:53,870
of a bad movie is
Field of Dreams?

66
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:56,210
It's about
ghost baseball players.

67
00:02:56,225 --> 00:02:57,823
I think it's stupid.

68
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:05,112
So, now he's all mad at me
about the stupid movie.

69
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,883
Robin, he's upset because
you wouldn't listen to him,

70
00:03:07,897 --> 00:03:10,031
not because you didn't like
some movie.

71
00:03:10,046 --> 00:03:13,242
How do you not like
Field of Dreams?!

72
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:17,962
Listening is the foundation
of a relationship.

73
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:19,593
And if he's really droning on,

74
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:22,092
you can always practice
saying the alphabet backwards.

75
00:03:22,107 --> 00:03:24,562
You know, in case
you get pulled over for a DUI.

76
00:03:24,575 --> 00:03:26,050
I guess I don't know
how to do that.

77
00:03:26,068 --> 00:03:28,492
Yeah, it's really hard,
even when you're sober.

78
00:03:28,506 --> 00:03:30,460
That's what I tried
to explain to the cop.

79
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:34,250
No, I mean, I guess I don't know
how to do this girlfriend thing.

80
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:37,631
I've never been in a relationship
this serious before.

81
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:41,692
I  should probably go tell him
I'm sorry, shouldn't I?

82
00:03:43,068 --> 00:03:45,290
You're trying to do it right now,
aren't you?

83
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,872
What the hell comes before "Q"?

84
00:03:48,656 --> 00:03:52,373
Then at the end of the movie when
he has a catch with his dad, like...

85
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:55,971
like he never did when he was
young enough for it to matter.

86
00:03:56,757 --> 00:03:59,271
Can we talk about something else?

87
00:03:59,857 --> 00:04:01,082
You know what, dude?

88
00:04:01,095 --> 00:04:03,401
Forget about Robin, okay?
You're hanging with us tonight.

89
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,280
I've got an awome party lined up.

90
00:04:05,295 --> 00:04:06,681
Oh, God.

91
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:10,351
This gonna be another one
of your weird all-guy parties?

92
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:13,511
That was a poker game.
What is wrong with you?

93
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,043
No, it's the first law school
party of the year

94
00:04:16,056 --> 00:04:17,592
and it's gonna be awesome.

95
00:04:17,606 --> 00:04:19,503
I haven't seen this guys since,
like, last year

96
00:04:19,518 --> 00:04:21,072
before Lily and I broke up.

97
00:04:21,087 --> 00:04:23,371
So I'm gonna have
to break the news to everybody.

98
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,343
It's really gonna bum them out.

99
00:04:25,985 --> 00:04:27,903
This party's gonna suck.

100
00:04:28,555 --> 00:04:31,341
Well, love to join you at that one.

101
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:34,190
But I got tickets to Foxy Boxing.

102
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:36,010
I wish I could join you guys,
but I got to get back

103
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:38,082
to my apparently boring job.

104
00:04:38,098 --> 00:04:40,622
- Your job's not boring.
- Robin thinks so.

105
00:04:40,635 --> 00:04:42,963
Dude, lots of chicks
think architects are hot.

106
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:45,520
Think about it,
you create something out of nothing.

107
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:46,670
You're like God.

108
00:04:46,687 --> 00:04:48,710
There's nobody hotter than God.

109
00:04:48,727 --> 00:04:50,672
I love it when you quote Scripture.

110
00:04:50,688 --> 00:04:54,780
I'm telling you, you should use
the architect angle with the ladies.

111
00:04:54,795 --> 00:04:57,040
Okay, first of all,
I have a girlfriend.

112
00:04:57,055 --> 00:04:59,512
Second, the architect angle
doesn't even work on her.

113
00:04:59,528 --> 00:05:02,440
And, third, I can't imagine
that working on anyone ever.

114
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:04,801
That's 'cause you're always like...

115
00:05:04,816 --> 00:05:08,121
Ted Mosby, architect.

116
00:05:08,368 --> 00:05:10,330
If it were me, I'd be like...

117
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:12,951
Ted Mosby, architect.

118
00:05:14,595 --> 00:05:18,181
Anything sounds impressive when
it's said with the right attitude.

119
00:05:18,717 --> 00:05:20,300
Marshall Ericksen.

120
00:05:20,318 --> 00:05:23,002
Recently dumped
and heading to a lame party.

121
00:05:23,018 --> 00:05:25,652
Whoa. Whoa, ladies,
please take it easy.

122
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:26,880
There's enough of me for everyone.

123
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:29,320
Oh. Hi. Hello.

124
00:05:29,337 --> 00:05:31,371
All right. We're gonna take off..

125
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:33,332
Wait up, I'll leave with you guys.

126
00:05:34,345 --> 00:05:36,851
Ted Mosby, architect.

127
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:38,513
Trust  me.

128
00:05:48,917 --> 00:05:50,911
Hey, just out of curiosity.

129
00:05:50,926 --> 00:05:52,642
If  a guy told you
he was an architect,

130
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:54,070
what would you think of that?

131
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,233
Are you kidding?

132
00:05:55,246 --> 00:05:57,461
Architects are hot.

133
00:05:57,477 --> 00:06:00,841
How do you think Mr. Brady
scored a babe like Carol?

134
00:06:00,856 --> 00:06:02,492
Solid point.

135
00:06:02,508 --> 00:06:04,452
She did have hair of gold.

136
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:06,421
- Yes, she did.
- Mm-hmm.

137
00:06:10,327 --> 00:06:12,061
Hey, Carl, is Ted still here?

138
00:06:12,076 --> 00:06:13,081
No.

139
00:06:13,097 --> 00:06:14,942
Hey, Lily.

140
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,282
- You still single?
- Yes.

141
00:06:17,398 --> 00:06:20,912
You know... I've poured a lot of
free drinks for you over the years.

142
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:22,320
A lot.

143
00:06:22,336 --> 00:06:24,721
Carl, do you really want
to be with a woman

144
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,969
who would trade sex for beer?

145
00:06:26,977 --> 00:06:28,913
Only if you're into it.

146
00:06:29,986 --> 00:06:31,223
It's on me.

147
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:32,760
Thanks.

148
00:06:32,778 --> 00:06:34,392
I wonder where Ted went.

149
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:36,972
Ted Mosby, the architect?

150
00:06:37,818 --> 00:06:39,112
Actually, yeah.

151
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,292
Oh, he is such a cool guy.

152
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,812
He was here earlier.

153
00:06:42,825 --> 00:06:46,190
And what made you decide
you wanted to become an architect?

154
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,811
Well, you know, soul of an artist,

155
00:06:48,826 --> 00:06:51,132
hands of a master craftsman.

156
00:06:51,145 --> 00:06:53,413
It was inevitable, I guess.

157
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:55,871
I bet you can draw, can't you?

158
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,363
You should draw me.

159
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:02,620
Well, I could try, but you might end up
looking like a midcentury tri-level.

160
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:07,573
Hey. If you want, my friend Marshall
invited me to this party we could all go to.

161
00:07:07,585 --> 00:07:09,372
Marshall's great.
He's just a lawyer,

162
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:12,660
but somebody has to push the paper
around for us creative types.

163
00:07:12,675 --> 00:07:14,140
- Am I right?
- Yeah.

164
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:19,073
He asked her to a party.
Oh, my God, are you okay?

165
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:21,471
Okay? It's awesome.
It's a win-win.

166
00:07:21,488 --> 00:07:23,622
Ted got to vent
and I don't have to hear it.

167
00:07:23,637 --> 00:07:25,823
Maybe after he's done with
the talkie-talk, he'll come over

168
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:27,341
and I'll get the fun part.

169
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:29,122
What is wrong with you?

170
00:07:29,136 --> 00:07:33,612
God, I feel like I'm teaching
love as a second language here.

171
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:36,503
Okay, you know how when
he tells you boring work stories

172
00:07:36,516 --> 00:07:37,950
you're supposed to listen?

173
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:40,920
Well, when he picks up
some random girl at a bar,

174
00:07:40,947 --> 00:07:42,581
you're supposed to freak out.

175
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,972
I'm not freaking out
because in my mind, she's fat.

176
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:48,763
She's a kickboxing instructor.

177
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:52,002
Her ass looks better than my face.

178
00:07:52,585 --> 00:07:54,822
All right, we'll swing by the party.

179
00:07:56,767 --> 00:07:59,251
Now the party was for
some of Marshall's classmates

180
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:01,051
from Columbia Law School,

181
00:08:01,065 --> 00:08:02,762
who by day were some of the sharpest

182
00:08:02,776 --> 00:08:05,733
and most serious
young legal minds in the country.

183
00:08:05,746 --> 00:08:07,683
By night, however...

184
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:12,540
Damn, these are some
drunk almost-lawyers.

185
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,282
Okay! Seriously...

186
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:17,190
who wants to shave my ass?!

187
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:20,480
That guy went on to become
a Supreme Court justice.

188
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:24,042
Okay, where are
the guys and the hooker?

189
00:08:24,058 --> 00:08:27,790
Yo, what's up, ladies?
Welcome to the party. Yeah!

190
00:08:27,806 --> 00:08:29,800
Just need you to sign
this release protecting the host

191
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:31,591
from any and all responsibility
should you harm yourself

192
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:32,711
or a third party.

193
00:08:32,728 --> 00:08:35,443
Then freakin' rage! Yeah!

194
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,463
Hey, drunk legal dude, um...
have you seen Marshall Ericksen?

195
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,013
He was with a guy named Ted.

196
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:42,110
You mean Ted Mosby, the architect?

197
00:08:42,126 --> 00:08:43,761
Man, what a visionary.

198
00:08:43,778 --> 00:08:45,870
Yeah, they were here.

199
00:08:46,856 --> 00:08:49,850
Awards are nice,
they look good on my shelf.

200
00:08:49,868 --> 00:08:52,380
But none of that acclaim means
anything compared to the joy

201
00:08:52,397 --> 00:08:55,600
of seeing the sun rise over
your first building.

202
00:08:55,617 --> 00:08:56,920
Wow.

203
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:59,822
I would love to watch
the sun rise with you.

204
00:08:59,838 --> 00:09:01,801
I know you would.

205
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:04,001
It's the job.

206
00:09:04,325 --> 00:09:07,792
Dude. You should let us
shave your ass tonight.

207
00:09:07,806 --> 00:09:09,642
No way.

208
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:13,013
Hey, Marshall, where's Lily?

209
00:09:13,925 --> 00:09:17,982
I didn't want to ruin the party
for everybody this early, but, uh...

210
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:20,293
everyone take a seat.

211
00:09:23,548 --> 00:09:26,873
Um... Lily actually called off
the wedding this summer

212
00:09:26,885 --> 00:09:28,872
to go to San Francisco.

213
00:09:28,887 --> 00:09:30,402
So...

214
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,442
we're broken up.

215
00:09:33,777 --> 00:09:36,042
Her name wasn't on
your lease, was it?

216
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:38,382
'Cause if not, New York state law,
you're not obligated

217
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:40,870
to give her half the deposit
when you move.

218
00:09:41,397 --> 00:09:43,802
Yeah, that's not really the part
I was worried about, guys.

219
00:09:43,815 --> 00:09:47,412
And don't forget the precedent set
by Smith v. Rosenblatt, '74.

220
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:49,633
Any personal effects she left
in your house or dwelling

221
00:09:49,648 --> 00:09:52,512
become yours after 30 days.

222
00:09:53,105 --> 00:09:57,300
Guys, can we cease and desist
with the lawyer speak for a minute?

223
00:09:57,316 --> 00:09:58,932
Love died.

224
00:09:58,947 --> 00:10:02,693
The love that made you all believe
in love, that's dead now.

225
00:10:05,475 --> 00:10:06,873
You should sue her.

226
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,550
Uh, really? On what ground, Kara?

227
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:11,730
On the grounds of... shut up.

228
00:10:13,917 --> 00:10:16,112
That's our attorney general.

229
00:10:18,056 --> 00:10:20,980
See? Marshall's still hung up
on our breakup.

230
00:10:20,996 --> 00:10:23,210
Why? Because I listened to him.

231
00:10:23,227 --> 00:10:25,900
It was a strong
and nurturing relationship

232
00:10:25,915 --> 00:10:29,050
that I threw away like old gum.

233
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:32,393
Not that I'm worried or anything,
but, um, back to the sun rising

234
00:10:32,407 --> 00:10:35,930
over Ted and, uh... oh,
what tasteful way did you describe her?

235
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:37,803
The girl with the smackable ass.

236
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:40,270
Yes, that's the young lady.

237
00:10:40,866 --> 00:10:45,010
So,  I know the bouncer
at this techno club, Posers.

238
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:46,793
Do you feel like dancing?

239
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:49,653
Yeah, okay.
There is no way Ted went dancing.

240
00:10:49,668 --> 00:10:51,091
Ted hates clubs.

241
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,563
Hell, yeah. I love clubs.

242
00:10:53,578 --> 00:10:55,840
I mean, I was going to design
a cathedral tonight,

243
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:58,830
kind of take a whack at the whole
relationship between God and man conundrum.

244
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:00,591
But sure, let's go dancing.

245
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:01,812
Wait, let me just check
with my friend.

246
00:11:01,826 --> 00:11:02,632
Okay.

247
00:11:02,647 --> 00:11:05,493
Hey, Marshall. You up for
some super loud, repetitive music

248
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:07,461
that hasn't changed
since the mid-90s?

249
00:11:07,477 --> 00:11:10,110
Um... only always.

250
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:12,042
Let's go.

251
00:11:12,556 --> 00:11:15,782
Dancing?
He went dancing with this girl?

252
00:11:15,928 --> 00:11:17,963
Okay, maybe this is a little bad.

253
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:20,632
Dancing is bad.
Dancing leads to sex.

254
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:22,923
Did you grow up
in that Footloose town?

255
00:11:22,936 --> 00:11:25,353
I'm calling him.
I'm telling him that I was wrong

256
00:11:25,368 --> 00:11:28,780
and I'm sorry, and I totally want to
listen to his stupid stories.

257
00:11:28,796 --> 00:11:32,810
Yeah, think of another way
to phrase that and you'll be fine.

258
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:35,722
He's not answering.

259
00:11:35,738 --> 00:11:37,730
Calling Marshall.

260
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,051
Hello.

261
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:43,782
Marshall, hi, it's Robin.
Can I talk to Ted?

262
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:45,572
Oh, Robin, hi.

263
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:49,553
Um, no, Ted's not here tonight.
He's, uh... he's working.

264
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:53,251
Uh, okay. Bye.

265
00:11:54,748 --> 00:11:56,701
Marshall just lied.

266
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:59,253
Ted's cheating on me.

267
00:12:04,447 --> 00:12:07,570
Excuse me. I'm looking for
a couple guys who came in here earlier.

268
00:12:07,585 --> 00:12:10,323
One's about six-four, 210,
sandy brown hair.

269
00:12:10,335 --> 00:12:12,670
And the other's a cheating bastard.

270
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:14,592
You're going to need
to refresh my memory.

271
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:19,012
Okay, fella, baby knows
how this game's played.

272
00:12:19,415 --> 00:12:21,653
How's a $20 help your memory?

273
00:12:21,668 --> 00:12:24,441
Thanks,  but seriously,
it was crazy tonight.

274
00:12:24,455 --> 00:12:27,112
You really do need
to refresh my memory.

275
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:28,870
Then can I have the...?

276
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:30,610
That's cool. You keep that.

277
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:33,053
So these guys--
one of them's an architect.

278
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:34,513
Ted Mosby, the architect?

279
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:35,601
That's the one.

280
00:12:35,615 --> 00:12:37,862
Oh, yeah, he was here.

281
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:41,790
And then I was all, "No, Frank Gehry.
You're on your own this time."

282
00:12:41,808 --> 00:12:45,671
And that, my dear,
was the end of that hack's career.

283
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,212
I live across the street.

284
00:12:48,228 --> 00:12:50,421
That is one hell of a non sequitur.

285
00:12:50,435 --> 00:12:51,831
You want to come over?

286
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:54,131
Well, I don't know.

287
00:12:54,168 --> 00:12:56,633
But I suppose I should at least
give you a ride home.

288
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:58,120
Hop on.

289
00:12:58,367 --> 00:13:00,011
I'll see you at book club, Vinny.

290
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,651
- Yeah. I'll be bringing the crudités.
- Nice.

291
00:13:04,156 --> 00:13:06,051
Dude, dude, what are you doing?

292
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:07,531
Galloping.

293
00:13:07,548 --> 00:13:11,322
You proved it, all right? The whole
Ted Mosby, architect things works.

294
00:13:11,336 --> 00:13:13,543
Architects rule! Whoo-hee!

295
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:15,441
Aren't you a little worried
that a certain somebody

296
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:17,432
might find out that
you're doing this?

297
00:13:17,446 --> 00:13:18,770
This isn't you, Ted.

298
00:13:18,787 --> 00:13:20,650
It is tonight.

299
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:22,420
Whoo!

300
00:13:24,957 --> 00:13:27,140
You know this girl.
Where does she live?

301
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:29,851
I'm not telling you that
for less than 20 bucks.

302
00:13:29,867 --> 00:13:32,163
- Well, I'm out of money.
- I'm cashed, too.

303
00:13:32,176 --> 00:13:33,651
I'll take your purse.

304
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,560
My purse?

305
00:13:34,578 --> 00:13:36,822
Yeah, my girl likes clutches.

306
00:13:38,086 --> 00:13:39,973
Okay, fine.

307
00:13:40,376 --> 00:13:44,263
You should tell her that looks
really good with a chocolate boot.

308
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,380
Bitch is lucky I brought
my small purse.

309
00:13:47,398 --> 00:13:49,741
No room for my gun. Here.

310
00:13:49,755 --> 00:13:52,052
Now where does the rodeo slut live?

311
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:55,543
The building with the green light,
apartment 3-C.

312
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:57,092
Oh, my God, Robin,

313
00:13:57,106 --> 00:13:59,770
are you going to kick
this girl's ass?

314
00:13:59,785 --> 00:14:01,173
Yeah...

315
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:03,423
and steal her purse.

316
00:14:06,357 --> 00:14:08,222
I can't believe
he's cheating on me.

317
00:14:08,237 --> 00:14:09,551
You know how many times
I could have cheated?

318
00:14:09,568 --> 00:14:11,113
Six... no seven.

319
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,693
And you know two of them,
and they would surprise you.

320
00:14:14,078 --> 00:14:16,133
3-C, let's do this. You ready?

321
00:14:16,145 --> 00:14:17,672
Should I just kick the door in?

322
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:19,863
Those are really nice heels
and you already lost the purse.

323
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,793
Let's see if it's unlocked.

324
00:14:22,677 --> 00:14:24,543
It's unlocked.

325
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:28,533
Okay, get in there
and kick some spankable ass.

326
00:14:30,527 --> 00:14:32,302
Robin.

327
00:14:32,728 --> 00:14:35,122
- I'm the problem.
- What?

328
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:36,460
You were right.

329
00:14:36,477 --> 00:14:37,852
I don't know how to be a girlfriend.

330
00:14:37,866 --> 00:14:39,632
I took the nicest guy in the world

331
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,412
and I made him a cheater.

332
00:14:41,428 --> 00:14:44,021
Well, don't stand out here
and beat yourself up.

333
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:45,771
Get in there and beat Ted up.

334
00:14:45,786 --> 00:14:48,112
I'll handle the slutty kickboxer.

335
00:14:48,126 --> 00:14:50,311
Actually, I'll take Ted.

336
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:53,300
- Let's do this.
- Bring it.

337
00:15:13,968 --> 00:15:15,653
What do you think you're...?

338
00:15:16,397 --> 00:15:17,593
Barney?

339
00:15:17,606 --> 00:15:20,591
Thank God you're here.
Can you help with this? I need nails.

340
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,552
Okay, I'm totally lost here.
Where's Ted?

341
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:26,430
Ted? He's at work.

342
00:15:26,448 --> 00:15:28,330
How did you get here?

343
00:15:28,655 --> 00:15:31,600
Awesome story. As per usual.

344
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:34,643
How do you think Mr. Brady
scored a babe like Carol?

345
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:35,993
Solid point.

346
00:15:36,007 --> 00:15:38,912
- And she did have hair of gold.
- Yes, she did.

347
00:15:38,926 --> 00:15:41,020
Sorry, I forgot my binocs
for Foxy Boxing.

348
00:15:41,038 --> 00:15:44,271
Whoo, looks like things just got
a little foxier right here.

349
00:15:44,286 --> 00:15:45,943
Yes, they did.
And you're just in time.

350
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:49,942
Girls, I got to go, but I'm leaving you
in very good, if slightly sullied hands.

351
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:52,941
Don't go. We don't even know your name
to look out for your buildings.

352
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:55,021
Yeah, stay.

353
00:15:56,195 --> 00:15:58,001
Excuse us for one second.

354
00:15:58,787 --> 00:16:02,010
Okay, you were right--
the architect thing totally works.

355
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,783
But I've got a girlfriend
and I've got to get back to work.

356
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:07,441
This project is getting
harder and harder.

357
00:16:07,458 --> 00:16:09,573
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah, had to.

358
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:10,833
See ya.

359
00:16:12,108 --> 00:16:15,483
Sorry, my, uh...
intern had to leave.

360
00:16:15,498 --> 00:16:17,371
Oh, well, that's too bad.

361
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:19,471
I'm Anna, by the way.

362
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:24,392
Ted Mosby... architect.

363
00:16:25,446 --> 00:16:28,583
But  none of that acclaim means
anything compared to the joy

364
00:16:28,595 --> 00:16:32,141
of seeing the sun rise
over your first building.

365
00:16:33,895 --> 00:16:36,920
- Dude, dude, what are you doing?
- Galloping.

366
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:41,403
All right, you proved it. The whole
Ted Mosby, architect thing works.

367
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:43,632
Architects rule! Whoo-hoo.

368
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:46,781
Aren't you afraid a certain somebody
might find out about this?

369
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,830
I mean, this isn't you, Ted.

370
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:50,872
It is tonight.

371
00:16:51,716 --> 00:16:53,770
And that led to a couple of hours

372
00:16:53,788 --> 00:16:57,742
that I cannot, as a gentleman,
divulge to you.

373
00:16:57,756 --> 00:17:00,692
We did it right here,
and here and here.

374
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:04,790
But why would you use
Ted's name?

375
00:17:04,807 --> 00:17:07,161
I've had some recent bad press
on the World Wide Web.

376
00:17:07,176 --> 00:17:11,062
So I'm taking a T.O. on the whole
"using my real name" thing.

377
00:17:11,968 --> 00:17:15,450
Oh, this is great.
It wasn't Ted. Everything's okay.

378
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:17,421
Everything isn't okay.

379
00:17:17,438 --> 00:17:21,792
Look at me. I'm acting crazy
and jealous and paranoid.

380
00:17:21,808 --> 00:17:24,582
This is how people act
in relationships.

381
00:17:24,597 --> 00:17:27,462
And that's why
I avoid relationships.

382
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,312
Well, guess what,

383
00:17:29,327 --> 00:17:32,532
I haven't been crazy or jealous
or paranoid in months,

384
00:17:32,548 --> 00:17:35,831
and I really miss it.

385
00:17:36,185 --> 00:17:38,810
And thus ended this chapter of,
"Let's pour our hearts out

386
00:17:38,826 --> 00:17:41,130
in the bedroom of Barney's
one-night stand."

387
00:17:41,146 --> 00:17:43,110
Come on, let's go before
she gets out of the shower.

388
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:45,643
You're such a pig.
You're not even going to say good-bye?

389
00:17:45,655 --> 00:17:49,350
I'll have you know
I composed a lovely form letter

390
00:17:49,365 --> 00:17:51,781
for use in just such an occasion.

391
00:17:52,247 --> 00:17:54,943
Just fill out her name and then...

392
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,862
Something with a "A."

393
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,532
A... A...

394
00:18:00,927 --> 00:18:03,500
I'll just put "resident."

395
00:18:05,436 --> 00:18:07,792
Go, go, go, go.

396
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,880
Robin took a long walk that night.

397
00:18:15,898 --> 00:18:18,580
She thought about how opening
yourself up to another person

398
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:21,941
usually means opening yourself up
to going a little crazy.

399
00:18:21,957 --> 00:18:25,750
She thought about how much easier
it was just to be alone.

400
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,620
And then she came to see me.

401
00:18:28,635 --> 00:18:33,092
# And I am nothing of a builder #

402
00:18:33,376 --> 00:18:38,050
# But here I dreamt I was an architect... #
Hey.

403
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:39,820
Hey.

404
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,791
- What are you doing here?
- I brought donuts.

405
00:18:42,805 --> 00:18:45,582
And I don't want to brag,
but they're filled with jelly.

406
00:18:46,197 --> 00:18:47,552
Thanks.

407
00:18:49,997 --> 00:18:52,870
So, uh... how was your night?

408
00:18:52,888 --> 00:18:56,130
It was... fine. Nothing exciting.

409
00:18:56,145 --> 00:18:58,563
How was yours?

410
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,390
You really want to hear about
boring architect stuff?

411
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:04,402
Yes, I do.

412
00:19:04,715 --> 00:19:07,192
I'm sorry about earlier.

413
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:10,331
To tell you the truth, I never
even saw all of Field of Dreams.

414
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:12,763
I fell asleep half way through.

415
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,973
What? The best part's
the last 20 minutes.

416
00:19:14,985 --> 00:19:17,650
Well, maybe they should have moved that
part up a little bit earlier, 'cause...

417
00:19:17,668 --> 00:19:19,722
You know what, um...

418
00:19:19,735 --> 00:19:22,683
What I'm trying to say is...

419
00:19:22,818 --> 00:19:26,023
I love being the person
you bitch to.

420
00:19:27,005 --> 00:19:31,133
So how was your day,
Mr. Architect?

421
00:19:31,146 --> 00:19:33,601
Oh, I like the way
you say that.

422
00:19:34,397 --> 00:19:36,430
Hey, you want to see
the building

423
00:19:36,445 --> 00:19:38,663
that will make every man
in Spokane feel inadequate?

424
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:40,361
Obviously.

425
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:43,063
- Wow.
- Yeah.

426
00:19:43,078 --> 00:19:45,350
You know, you didn't mention
all the foliage around the base.

427
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:47,241
If you trim that back,
the rest would look bigger.

428
00:19:47,255 --> 00:19:49,471
You don't have to tell me.

429
00:19:50,955 --> 00:19:54,733
And, um... just for fun, I've...

430
00:19:54,746 --> 00:19:58,612
I've sort of been working on my own idea
of what I think the building should be.

431
00:20:03,026 --> 00:20:04,901
What do you think?

432
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:09,693
You know that time we went to Spokane
and I pointed out that skyscraper?

433
00:20:09,705 --> 00:20:12,481
That was the first building
I ever designed.

434
00:20:12,495 --> 00:20:17,001
And that night was the first time
I showed anyone my first drawing of it.

435
00:20:17,398 --> 00:20:19,021
Wow.

436
00:20:19,485 --> 00:20:21,953
Ted, this is amazing.

437
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,880
Thanks.

438
00:20:25,277 --> 00:20:27,831
It's not like it will ever
come to anything.

439
00:20:27,846 --> 00:20:29,600
I don't know.

440
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:32,063
It might come to something.

441
00:20:32,276 --> 00:20:37,232
You know, girls find
architects very hot.

442
00:20:40,888 --> 00:20:42,852
Okay,

443
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:47,261
but I don't want you expecting
78 stories or anything.

444
00:20:53,628 --> 00:20:55,742
"Dear Resident...

445
00:20:55,756 --> 00:20:58,673
The time we spent together,
however long it was,

446
00:20:58,688 --> 00:21:00,543
meant the world to me.

447
00:21:00,555 --> 00:21:03,473
I would love to see you again,
but unfortunately, I cannot.

448
00:21:03,487 --> 00:21:06,961
You see, I am a ghost.

449
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:09,883
I can't only materialize
once every decade

450
00:21:09,895 --> 00:21:12,400
on the anniversary of my death.

451
00:21:12,415 --> 00:21:15,552
I chose to spend my one day among
the living with you,

452
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:17,613
sweet... Resident.

453
00:21:17,625 --> 00:21:20,530
Perhaps we will meet again
in another decade,

454
00:21:20,546 --> 00:21:22,851
provided you keep your figure.

455
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:26,392
Until then, all my love
from the beyond.

456
00:21:26,408 --> 00:21:28,121
Barney."

457
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:30,730
Barney?

458
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:34,441
Who the hell is Barney?

459
