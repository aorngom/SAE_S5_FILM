1
00:00:01,444 --> 00:00:04,049
Barney is crazy if he thinks
this is gonna work.

2
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:06,259
- I think it's gonna work.
- I hope it doesn't work.

3
00:00:06,748 --> 00:00:07,761
Here he comes.

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:13,475
You there, what's your name?

5
00:00:13,738 --> 00:00:16,436
- Excuse me?
- Your name, woman, what's your name?

6
00:00:16,596 --> 00:00:17,532
Cindy.

7
00:00:17,652 --> 00:00:18,712
I knew it.

8
00:00:18,925 --> 00:00:20,176
You're the Cindy,

9
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:22,571
the one who can change everything,

10
00:00:22,691 --> 00:00:24,986
or spell our inevitable doom.

11
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,026
Now listen to me, Cindy.

12
00:00:27,357 --> 00:00:30,541
I am Barney Stinson,
and I am on an urgent mission

13
00:00:30,863 --> 00:00:32,786
- from the future.
- The future?

14
00:00:32,946 --> 00:00:34,829
The future,
and I can prove it to you.

15
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,716
In exactly four seconds,
the woman at that booth

16
00:00:37,836 --> 00:00:39,542
is going to slap that man.

17
00:00:42,956 --> 00:00:44,005
What the hell?

18
00:00:45,033 --> 00:00:48,468
In a few minutes,
the young me from your time

19
00:00:48,827 --> 00:00:50,924
is going to come through that door.

20
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:52,222
Now, Cindy,

21
00:00:52,478 --> 00:00:54,122
I know this sounds insane,

22
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,643
but in order to save the planet,

23
00:00:57,201 --> 00:01:00,313
you need to sleep with him tonight.

24
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:03,960
- What? I...
- Sleep with Barney Stinson tonight,

25
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:05,652
in whatever way he wants it,

26
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,746
or he won't be able to find
the solution to global warming

27
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:11,825
that saves the human race.

28
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:14,734
- What are you talking about?
- I have no time to explain.

29
00:01:14,854 --> 00:01:18,540
I have to get back to the reality
accelerator before the vortex closes.

30
00:01:20,064 --> 00:01:22,293
Only you can save us, Cindy.

31
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:24,118
I must away!

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,133
Okay, guys,
the movers are coming in 14 hours.

33
00:01:28,698 --> 00:01:30,802
We gotta get back upstairs
and finish packing.

34
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:34,111
You guys aren't finished packing?
How is this taking so long?

35
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:37,183
All the great memories of our 20s
took place in that apartment.

36
00:01:37,668 --> 00:01:40,395
It's not like throwing stuff in a box.
You start to reminisce.

37
00:01:40,658 --> 00:01:43,399
Not me. The key?
Throw stuff out and never look back.

38
00:01:43,519 --> 00:01:45,775
I'm moving to Japan.
It took me a half hour to pack.

39
00:01:45,935 --> 00:01:48,141
- A half hour?
- It would have taken me 20 minutes,

40
00:01:48,261 --> 00:01:49,738
but a friend called me in tears.

41
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,898
Moving is really emotional.

42
00:01:52,692 --> 00:01:55,116
It is.
I mean, everything is changing.

43
00:01:55,339 --> 00:01:58,323
I'm gonna be living in New Jersey with
Stella, you will be in your new place.

44
00:01:58,443 --> 00:02:02,375
You're starting a new job in Tokyo.
It's the end of an era.

45
00:02:03,075 --> 00:02:05,773
I think we should have a toast,
but not our usual crap.

46
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:08,882
Your most expensive bottle
of scotch.

47
00:02:09,164 --> 00:02:13,094
That's 50-year-old Glen McKenna,
and it's $2,500.

48
00:02:13,254 --> 00:02:15,692
Excellent.
A bottle of that with beer chasers,

49
00:02:15,812 --> 00:02:17,902
and what do you think,
cancel the scotch?

50
00:02:21,153 --> 00:02:22,187
Vodka rocks.

51
00:02:22,656 --> 00:02:24,676
- It's not gonna work.
- Oh, my God,

52
00:02:25,558 --> 00:02:27,112
You're... Oh, my God!

53
00:02:28,043 --> 00:02:29,402
Can I buy you a drink?

54
00:02:32,166 --> 00:02:34,369
I suppose I have time
for one drink and...

55
00:02:35,046 --> 00:02:37,452
45 minutes to an hour
of some other activity,

56
00:02:37,738 --> 00:02:39,329
but after that,
I have to get back to

57
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:42,081
a top-secret research project
I'm working on.

58
00:02:42,898 --> 00:02:44,000
Global warming?

59
00:02:44,392 --> 00:02:45,392
My God,

60
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,587
how did you know that?

61
00:02:49,165 --> 00:02:51,348
Synchro: ShalimarFox, Arrow

62
00:03:02,217 --> 00:03:03,269
Look at this.

63
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:06,064
A photo from the first day
we moved into this place.

64
00:03:08,191 --> 00:03:09,800
So many great memories.

65
00:03:10,144 --> 00:03:12,946
See? That is exactly the type of crap
you should be trashing.

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,074
So you don't keep any photos?

67
00:03:16,234 --> 00:03:19,274
No, they're like love letters
or yearbooks or someone's ashes.

68
00:03:19,394 --> 00:03:20,620
They just take up space.

69
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:23,623
Besides, Stella's not gonna let you
keep half of this junk.

70
00:03:23,783 --> 00:03:25,121
Why wouldn't she?

71
00:03:27,412 --> 00:03:28,337
Oh, sweetie.

72
00:03:28,457 --> 00:03:32,132
Okay, here's the thing that guys only
learn after they move in with a woman.

73
00:03:32,647 --> 00:03:34,259
All of your stuff is stupid.

74
00:03:34,902 --> 00:03:36,137
Like what?

75
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:39,430
Like anything you bought
at a Renaissance Faire.

76
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,852
There's not enough mead in the world
to make me get rid of my flail.

77
00:03:44,257 --> 00:03:47,545
Oh, hey, Ted, since we're clearly
not getting our security deposit back,

78
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:49,816
I thought maybe
you could reimburse me for my half.

79
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:52,151
Wait a second, why should I have
to pay more than you?

80
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,409
Because
you treated this apartment the way

81
00:03:54,529 --> 00:03:56,823
John Bonham treated
his central nervous system.

82
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:57,949
That's not true.

83
00:03:58,463 --> 00:03:59,623
Exhibit A.

84
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:08,001
- What's that?
- A 1986 World Book encyclopaedia.

85
00:04:08,161 --> 00:04:09,836
It's exactly the one I grew up with.

86
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:11,337
Encyclopaedia?

87
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,549
You think it should be pronounced
encyclo-pee-dia.

88
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:18,558
It's a common mistake. But if you look
at that squished together "ae"

89
00:04:18,678 --> 00:04:20,388
symbol in this here encyclopaedia,

90
00:04:20,818 --> 00:04:22,834
you'll learn
that it's a ligature derived

91
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:24,924
from the Anglo-Saxon rune ash...

92
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:33,651
You know,
you're gonna have to paedia for that.

93
00:04:35,301 --> 00:04:36,362
But you never did.

94
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,781
And then there's Exhibit B.

95
00:04:43,255 --> 00:04:45,246
Good morrow, fair gentles.

96
00:04:45,406 --> 00:04:47,707
Look what I won
at the Renaissance Faire.

97
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:55,632
You're also responsible for any damage
Robin did when she was your girlfriend.

98
00:04:55,999 --> 00:04:57,592
What damage did I cause?

99
00:04:58,335 --> 00:05:01,086
Do you remember that night when you
drank the 12'er of Molson, you got all

100
00:05:01,206 --> 00:05:02,547
super Canadian?

101
00:05:05,489 --> 00:05:07,560
Stanley Cup, game six?

102
00:05:08,101 --> 00:05:10,179
The Rangers are about to be sorry

103
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:12,106
they ever played shinny
with the Canucks.

104
00:05:13,945 --> 00:05:16,027
I'll give you 20$ if you
shoot it on this front door.

105
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:20,114
You're nuttier than
a Tim Horton's maple log.

106
00:05:20,734 --> 00:05:21,744
Timmy Ho!

107
00:05:23,576 --> 00:05:25,467
That's it. Give me the stick.

108
00:05:26,906 --> 00:05:28,530
I'll give you summer teeth.

109
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,541
Some are here, some are there.

110
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:32,961
Robin, give me the stick.

111
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
Take off,

112
00:05:35,023 --> 00:05:35,922
hoser.

113
00:05:36,082 --> 00:05:37,082
That's it!

114
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,884
- Get her, boys, get her!
- I'll scrap!

115
00:05:40,044 --> 00:05:42,003
- Guys, come on!
- For America.

116
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:45,264
Break it, break it up!

117
00:05:47,645 --> 00:05:50,065
You never break up a girl fight!

118
00:05:50,274 --> 00:05:51,274
Never!

119
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,276
Entirely Barney's fault.

120
00:05:56,436 --> 00:05:59,416
As, by the way, is the big
scorch mark over the fireplace.

121
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,742
<i>Kids, to understand
the story of the scorch mark,</i>

122
00:06:04,862 --> 00:06:08,336
<i>I first need to tell you the story of
the intervention for our friend Stewart.</i>

123
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:09,414
What's going on?

124
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:13,128
This is an intervention.

125
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,239
The alcohol changes you.

126
00:06:16,896 --> 00:06:18,823
It makes you a different person.

127
00:06:19,194 --> 00:06:21,731
And I'm in love
with the man that I married.

128
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:23,803
Thank you.

129
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:26,997
This is just the push I need.

130
00:06:28,494 --> 00:06:29,743
I love you guys.

131
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:34,858
There's the birthday boy.

132
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:38,484
Time to let the party monster
out of its cage, Stewie!

133
00:06:40,231 --> 00:06:41,508
Come on, buddy.

134
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:43,945
People don't want to see
Bruce Banner, dude.

135
00:06:44,065 --> 00:06:45,408
They want to see the Hulk.

136
00:06:45,712 --> 00:06:48,575
Hulk, Hulk, Hulk... What?

137
00:06:55,657 --> 00:06:57,795
That's what I get
for skimming the E-vite.

138
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:03,134
<i>Later that day, we celebrated
our first successful intervention.</i>

139
00:07:03,294 --> 00:07:05,727
I am really proud of us
for helping Stewart.

140
00:07:06,464 --> 00:07:09,182
What an amazing honest,
human moment.

141
00:07:09,342 --> 00:07:10,710
I agree. Yay us.

142
00:07:11,637 --> 00:07:14,479
Marshall, are you really
gonna keep wearing that hat?

143
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,064
It's been two weeks.

144
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:18,058
Two awesome weeks...

145
00:07:18,692 --> 00:07:19,867
and heck, yeah,

146
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:21,877
I'm gonna keep wearing it.

147
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:33,373
This is an intervention.

148
00:07:34,784 --> 00:07:35,994
It's about the hat.

149
00:07:39,138 --> 00:07:40,947
I have it under control, okay?

150
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:43,640
I can take it off
whenever I want to.

151
00:07:44,978 --> 00:07:46,113
"Dear Marshall,

152
00:07:47,365 --> 00:07:49,274
"I do not like that stupid hat.

153
00:07:49,754 --> 00:07:51,632
"I want to beat it with a bat.

154
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,413
"Or maybe stab it with a fork.

155
00:07:55,054 --> 00:07:57,021
"It makes you look
like such a dork."

156
00:07:58,467 --> 00:08:00,021
<i>After that, interventions became</i>

157
00:08:00,141 --> 00:08:02,633
<i>a pretty regular thing
around our apartment.</i>

158
00:08:06,224 --> 00:08:07,242
Cor blimey.

159
00:08:08,152 --> 00:08:10,827
This is a nice bloody surprise.
What's this about then?

160
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,387
It's about the weird
fake English accent.

161
00:08:16,545 --> 00:08:17,545
Bollocks.

162
00:08:24,339 --> 00:08:25,340
Spray tan?

163
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,139
They reel you in with a coupon,
and then you just get hooked.

164
00:08:31,299 --> 00:08:33,182
We know, sweetie, we know.

165
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:35,979
This is a new sweater.

166
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:39,835
What?

167
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,985
- The magic tricks.
- Specifically, those involving fire.

168
00:08:44,343 --> 00:08:45,361
Magic tricks?

169
00:08:46,037 --> 00:08:48,984
Guys, interventions
are supposed to help people,

170
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:51,826
not attack every little thing
you don't like about them.

171
00:08:52,876 --> 00:08:55,039
I'm sorry,
but that really steams me.

172
00:08:55,715 --> 00:08:57,373
That really burns me up!

173
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,677
I mean, I am filled

174
00:09:00,132 --> 00:09:02,786
with a white-hot rage!

175
00:09:08,623 --> 00:09:09,658
Thank you.

176
00:09:12,253 --> 00:09:14,216
- Oh, shoot.
- I smell hair! I smell hair!

177
00:09:14,336 --> 00:09:16,434
<i>And that's the story
of the scorch mark.</i>

178
00:09:17,058 --> 00:09:17,977
That's weird.

179
00:09:18,309 --> 00:09:21,564
When I was going through the closet,
I thought I saw the intervention banner.

180
00:09:22,915 --> 00:09:23,816
So?

181
00:09:23,976 --> 00:09:26,360
The banner burned up.
Why is there a new one?

182
00:09:27,338 --> 00:09:30,429
And there are sealed letters here
from all of you that say "Ted."

183
00:09:31,676 --> 00:09:33,576
Were you guys planning
an intervention for me?

184
00:09:34,174 --> 00:09:36,006
Oh, that, that was stupid.

185
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,667
Just forget about that.

186
00:09:38,032 --> 00:09:39,624
What was it for? The Crocs?

187
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:42,539
- The hair product?
- Not Stella.

188
00:09:44,268 --> 00:09:46,005
Oh, my God, this was about Stella.

189
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:49,333
I just said... "Not Stella."

190
00:09:49,453 --> 00:09:52,512
So maybe it was about
your poor listening skills.

191
00:09:52,672 --> 00:09:54,573
- What?
- It's out of control. See?

192
00:09:55,814 --> 00:09:57,975
You guys don't think
I should marry Stella.

193
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,565
You guys don't think
I should marry Stella.

194
00:10:04,725 --> 00:10:07,451
Ted, we do.
We're all really happy for you.

195
00:10:07,571 --> 00:10:09,504
Yeah. Like I said, it was stupid.

196
00:10:09,855 --> 00:10:12,148
Obviously, it wasn't,
because we agreed not to have

197
00:10:12,268 --> 00:10:14,700
any more stupid interventions
at our intervention intervention.

198
00:10:16,767 --> 00:10:18,845
We're having too many interventions.

199
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,167
So, what was your big serious problem
with me and Stella?

200
00:10:24,232 --> 00:10:25,044
Yes!

201
00:10:25,324 --> 00:10:27,338
Yes! In everyone's face!

202
00:10:27,718 --> 00:10:29,782
You all said the "future Barney" thing
wouldn't work.

203
00:10:29,902 --> 00:10:31,617
You told me I was crazy.

204
00:10:31,737 --> 00:10:34,371
My shrink told me I was crazy.

205
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:38,891
Who's the narcissist with severe
attachment disorder now, Dr. Grossbard?

206
00:10:41,247 --> 00:10:42,853
Intervention banner?
What's that for?

207
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,945
- "Ted, I cannot stand idly by..."
- You've just been carrying that around?

208
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:51,988
Please, Ted?

209
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,497
"I cannot stand idly by
while you make

210
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:58,661
"the biggest mistake any man
can make... getting married.

211
00:10:59,385 --> 00:11:01,450
"Mark my words, this whole thing

212
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,541
"is gonna go up in...

213
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:05,334
"flames!"

214
00:11:06,225 --> 00:11:07,235
Oh, damn!

215
00:11:07,517 --> 00:11:09,307
I put the flame cue too early.

216
00:11:09,427 --> 00:11:11,550
I had so many more
important things to say, and...

217
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,465
The point is, Ted,

218
00:11:14,162 --> 00:11:16,605
marriage... is stupid.

219
00:11:18,007 --> 00:11:22,412
Every year, there are
a million new hot 22-year-olds

220
00:11:22,532 --> 00:11:25,492
walking into bars,
and call me "glass half full,"

221
00:11:25,612 --> 00:11:27,231
but I think they're getting dumber.

222
00:11:28,242 --> 00:11:32,194
Come on, even you aren't still gonna be
hitting on 22-year-olds when you're 80.

223
00:11:33,303 --> 00:11:35,865
- I accept that challenge.
- What challenge?

224
00:11:36,147 --> 00:11:40,193
To prove to you
that I will be exactly this awesome

225
00:11:40,313 --> 00:11:44,104
when I'm 80, I will hook up
with a 22-year-old

226
00:11:44,386 --> 00:11:46,125
while in my old-man makeup.

227
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,155
I didn't remotely
challenge you to that.

228
00:11:49,663 --> 00:11:53,467
I mean, I definitely want to see it.
I didn't remotely challenge you to that.

229
00:11:54,319 --> 00:11:57,564
- I want to hear the other letters.
- Ted, this is ridiculous.

230
00:11:57,684 --> 00:12:00,473
- We changed our minds.
- And suppose you change them back?

231
00:12:01,109 --> 00:12:02,988
Lily, come on, let's hear yours.

232
00:12:07,553 --> 00:12:10,735
"Gilbert's reading skills have
improved drastically since..."

233
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:14,996
Wait, this is a letter I meant to send
home with one of my kindergarteners.

234
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:21,202
Are things moving too fast
between you and a girl named Stella?

235
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:23,134
I wish.

236
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,626
Robin, could I hear yours?

237
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:38,260
"Dear Ted, it's "encyclo-pee-dia",
not encyclo-pay-dia".

238
00:12:38,744 --> 00:12:41,820
"Why do you always say things
in the most pretentious way possible?

239
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:45,842
"It makes you sound douchey,
and that's "douchey", not "douch-ay"."

240
00:12:46,595 --> 00:12:49,271
Yeah, you already read that one
at my pronunciation intervention.

241
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,879
- Where's the letter about Stella?
- I didn't write one.

242
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:56,320
I'm your ex{\-girlfriend}. I figured anything
I said on the subject would sound catty.

243
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,694
Plus, I'm hotter than her,
so who cares?

244
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,371
- Dude, it's water under the bridge...
- Please.

245
00:13:13,134 --> 00:13:14,144
"Dear Ted,

246
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:16,841
"Stella seems
like a wonderful person.

247
00:13:19,194 --> 00:13:21,387
"But you don't know her
well enough to get married.

248
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:24,373
"You certainly don't know her
well enough

249
00:13:24,493 --> 00:13:26,642
"to commit to raising
a seven-year-old with her.

250
00:13:28,762 --> 00:13:30,832
"You're not doing her, her child

251
00:13:30,952 --> 00:13:33,816
"or yourself any favors
by rushing into this.

252
00:13:35,185 --> 00:13:37,027
"Just give it some more time."

253
00:13:38,658 --> 00:13:40,874
Dude, that was months ago,
all right?

254
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:42,796
That was before we got
to know Stella

255
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:46,120
and see how awesome she is
and what a great couple you guys are.

256
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:48,748
That's why we decided not
to even have that intervention.

257
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:52,251
Thank you. Because I really need
you guys to be on board with this.

258
00:13:52,605 --> 00:13:55,087
- And we are.
- And we hope you're not mad at us.

259
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:56,247
Course not.

260
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:59,088
It's not like
what you said was crazy.

261
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,052
You had a lot of valid concerns.

262
00:14:02,213 --> 00:14:04,722
But concerns we have
completely moved on from.

263
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,395
But you had a point. I mean,
this whole thing has moved pretty fast.

264
00:14:09,678 --> 00:14:11,720
You know what?
Maybe that's because...

265
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,522
when it's right, you just know.

266
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:15,631
Yeah, I guess, but we are still,

267
00:14:16,124 --> 00:14:17,945
you know,
getting to know each other.

268
00:14:18,239 --> 00:14:22,115
And, Lily, maybe you're right.
Maybe Stella won't like any of my stuff.

269
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,075
Like the robot cookie jar.

270
00:14:26,092 --> 00:14:28,579
This was, like, the first thing
we bought for this place, remember?

271
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:30,062
Of course I do.

272
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:34,408
My sensors indicate
that your pecan sandy levels

273
00:14:34,528 --> 00:14:36,277
are dangerously low.

274
00:14:38,499 --> 00:14:41,037
My collection of James Bond movies.

275
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:43,393
Remember? We watched them
all in order, an then...

276
00:14:43,513 --> 00:14:46,472
Lily spoke in that weird English accent
for, like, the next month?

277
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:48,057
It was sophisticated.

278
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:52,939
My signed Bernie Kosar cleats.

279
00:14:53,186 --> 00:14:54,871
My elephant lamp.

280
00:14:55,265 --> 00:14:56,565
The English phone booth.

281
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:58,150
My sombrero!

282
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:03,405
- What are you doing?
- Unpacking.

283
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:06,408
I am never leaving this apartment!

284
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,460
No, Ted, stop unpacking.
You're just freaking out.

285
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,514
I'm not ready for{\ all the} responsibility.
And I'm certainly not ready to be

286
00:15:19,634 --> 00:15:22,186
a step-dad to a seven-year-old.

287
00:15:22,444 --> 00:15:24,927
I mean, if I get married
and move to the suburbs,

288
00:15:25,087 --> 00:15:27,263
in the blink of an eye,
I've become an old man!

289
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:31,016
Hello, young lady.

290
00:15:32,443 --> 00:15:34,392
You want a butterscotch candy?

291
00:15:35,681 --> 00:15:37,690
What do you mean,
"nothing in common"?

292
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,441
We're both seniors.

293
00:15:43,521 --> 00:15:44,572
You're cute.

294
00:15:45,184 --> 00:15:47,462
- How old are you?
- 83.

295
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:50,244
- How old are you?
- 31.

296
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,158
Ted has officially snapped.

297
00:15:56,278 --> 00:15:58,458
There are moving men
coming in ten hours.

298
00:15:58,578 --> 00:16:02,381
His fiancée is waiting for him
in New Jersey. We have to do something.

299
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,635
I got this.

300
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:09,109
- Hey, bud?
- Hey.

301
00:16:09,903 --> 00:16:12,310
- Why don't you come here for a minute.
- What?

302
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:16,103
I want you to know
this is all totally normal.

303
00:16:16,623 --> 00:16:19,465
Big transitions can be scary,
and cold feet...

304
00:16:20,266 --> 00:16:22,485
they're just part of the deal.
So...

305
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,072
How about you give me the knife?
Give me the knife.

306
00:16:28,108 --> 00:16:29,074
Come on.

307
00:16:32,085 --> 00:16:35,581
I can start unpacking, too. I'm staying
here right by your side forever, buddy!

308
00:16:38,584 --> 00:16:40,419
Our lives have been good here.

309
00:16:40,868 --> 00:16:43,945
That's why we've been putting off
packing. Because subconsciously,

310
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:47,834
we both know that it would be stupid
to leave. It's safe and warm here.

311
00:16:47,954 --> 00:16:50,929
There's a bar downstairs,
and a cookie robot in the kitchen.

312
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:53,055
This is my home,
and I'm never leaving!

313
00:16:53,175 --> 00:16:54,183
Listen to you!

314
00:16:54,343 --> 00:16:56,752
You sound like that
fat dweeby kid at camp.

315
00:16:57,011 --> 00:16:58,781
"Mom, Dad, I want to come home.

316
00:16:58,901 --> 00:17:01,565
"The cool kids are playing
keep-away with my inhaler."

317
00:17:01,725 --> 00:17:04,397
I can't believe my dad read that letter
at our wedding.

318
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:06,100
You can't do this to Lily.

319
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,197
I know your new place
has had some problems,

320
00:17:08,357 --> 00:17:11,587
with the slanted floors
and the nearby sewage treatment plant,

321
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:13,661
but you're gonna turn it
into a great home.

322
00:17:14,253 --> 00:17:15,371
Tell him, Lily.

323
00:17:15,531 --> 00:17:17,907
It's a black hole
where dreams go to die.

324
00:17:18,027 --> 00:17:20,085
- I'm not moving, either.
- Come on.

325
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,290
You guys finish unpacking.
I'm gonna go bake some cookies

326
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,985
to fill R2-Sweet Tooth.

327
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:28,968
Oh, my God, look at you cowards!

328
00:17:29,251 --> 00:17:31,303
So afraid of any kind of change.

329
00:17:31,463 --> 00:17:33,674
So terrified of anything new.

330
00:17:33,794 --> 00:17:37,201
So desperate to cling
to anything comfortable and familiar.

331
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:38,915
I can't move to Japan.

332
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:43,565
What was I thinking?
It's so far away.

333
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:45,135
I don't speak the language.

334
00:17:45,255 --> 00:17:46,837
I didn't even have any good pictures

335
00:17:46,957 --> 00:17:48,941
- of you guys.
- Oh, sweetie.

336
00:17:49,648 --> 00:17:52,137
Everybody says
change is so great, right?

337
00:17:52,257 --> 00:17:55,271
- But what's so great about change?
- Who wants to walk down

338
00:17:55,391 --> 00:17:57,630
to our same old bar,
sit in our regular booth

339
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,998
and order the usual?

340
00:18:00,069 --> 00:18:02,370
The usual! My favorite!

341
00:18:04,953 --> 00:18:06,538
Oh, my God.

342
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:17,933
I believe someone owes me $200.

343
00:18:18,093 --> 00:18:20,519
Barney, this was never a bet.
Nobody...

344
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,120
This proves that I will be
this awesome when I'm 80.

345
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,825
Arthritis five.

346
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,533
- I'm moving to New Jersey.
- What?

347
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:33,721
You and Marshall should move
to your new place,

348
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:36,285
- and Robin should go to Japan.
- Why?

349
00:18:36,445 --> 00:18:38,871
Because we're gonna get older
whether we like it or not,

350
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:40,440
so the only question is

351
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:42,776
whether we want
to get on with our lives

352
00:18:42,896 --> 00:18:46,211
or desperately cling to the past
and end up like that.

353
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:48,005
You mean awesome?

354
00:18:48,646 --> 00:18:50,460
I'm 80, dude,

355
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,093
and I'm making out
with a 22-year-old.

356
00:18:54,379 --> 00:18:56,253
Take me to your place, <i>chéri</i>.

357
00:18:56,582 --> 00:18:58,848
I want to see
your World War II medals.

358
00:18:59,551 --> 00:19:01,400
In a minute, <i>mon petite</i>.

359
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,729
All right, so that doesn't count.

360
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:05,230
What? Why?

361
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,858
She's French that's like
playing tennis with the net down.

362
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:10,024
You know what?

363
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:11,904
I'll cover the security deposit.

364
00:19:12,222 --> 00:19:13,489
I'm glad to, because...

365
00:19:13,926 --> 00:19:17,409
every dent in that place represents
a memory that I'll cherish forever.

366
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:18,869
But on one condition:

367
00:19:19,098 --> 00:19:22,414
we all put aside ten bucks
every week for the next year,

368
00:19:22,574 --> 00:19:25,793
and we come back here and we
buy that 50-year-old scotch,

369
00:19:25,953 --> 00:19:27,685
and we toast the incredible

370
00:19:27,805 --> 00:19:31,417
life-changing year we've all had.
Get out of our booth.

371
00:19:34,753 --> 00:19:36,011
Me with my new family,

372
00:19:36,171 --> 00:19:38,847
Marshall and Lily,
in their new apartment, and Robin

373
00:19:39,007 --> 00:19:42,392
as the number one English-speaking
journalist in the Pacific Rim,

374
00:19:43,076 --> 00:19:46,230
visiting us here in New York
to celebrate this day...

375
00:19:46,513 --> 00:19:49,390
The day we closed
an incredible chapter in our lives,

376
00:19:49,928 --> 00:19:51,276
only to open up a new one.

377
00:19:52,955 --> 00:19:55,030
- I think I left my cell...
- Get out of here.

378
00:19:57,869 --> 00:20:00,672
<i>And one year later,
that's exactly what we did.</i>

379
00:20:00,792 --> 00:20:02,454
And so let's raise a glass

380
00:20:02,614 --> 00:20:05,457
of $2,500 scotch
to one hell of a year.

381
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:10,835
Amazing.

382
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,464
That's unbelievable.

383
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:15,745
It's kind of smoky,
with a hint of aged cedar and...

384
00:20:15,865 --> 00:20:17,970
Do you guys taste the difference
and ten-dollar scotch?

385
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,264
- No difference.
- I want to cut mine with Red Bull.

386
00:20:20,609 --> 00:20:22,605
Oh, Wendy, can you take a picture?

387
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,853
<i>A lot of things
did change that year,</i>

388
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:28,564
<i>but some things stayed the same.</i>

389
00:20:28,873 --> 00:20:32,442
So... what do you say we move
this party upstairs to the apartment?

390
00:20:32,602 --> 00:20:34,074
- Yeah.
- Great idea.

391
00:20:35,107 --> 00:20:36,528
I got the scotch.

392
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:43,620
What the...?

393
00:20:45,658 --> 00:20:47,916
Barney, this is an intervention.

394
00:20:48,819 --> 00:20:51,062
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

395
00:20:51,496 --> 00:20:53,630
Enough with the "old man" bit.

396
00:20:54,366 --> 00:20:56,092
What about the old sand pit?

397
00:20:56,585 --> 00:20:58,010
Let it go.

398
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,476
"Let It Snow"?

399
00:20:59,596 --> 00:21:01,471
I love that old ditty!

400
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:04,907
I'm getting my flail.

401
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:07,162
You're setting sail?
