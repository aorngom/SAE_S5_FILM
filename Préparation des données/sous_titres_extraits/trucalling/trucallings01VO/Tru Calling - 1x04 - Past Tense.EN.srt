1
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,908
Actually, it' a summer internship...

2
00:00:09,976 --> 00:00:13,241
but sky's the limit. That would be me,
you know? It's always....

3
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:15,907
- What's going on?
- Come on. It's time.

4
00:00:15,982 --> 00:00:17,916
- Okay. Call me.
- I will.

5
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:19,884
She's not gonna call me.

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,416
Move. Watch it!

7
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,090
I didn't miss it, did I? Did I miss it?

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,152
No, you did not.

9
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:31,422
- Where the hell is Blake?
- Late.

10
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:34,865
- Why should tonight be different?
- Because it's our last night together.

11
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:36,424
Hey, sorry I'm late.

12
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:38,527
- I ran into my ex.
Which one?

13
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:41,505
To be honest,
I can't even tell them apart no more.

14
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,499
All right, glasses up.

15
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:47,410
Gentlemen, it took us four years.

16
00:00:47,514 --> 00:00:49,505
Excuse me, Ethan, five.

17
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,975
But as of tonight, we are free men.

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,915
The scenery may change,
but our friendship won't.

19
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:01,357
To the best night of our lives!

20
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:23,640
Pretty out here.

21
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:26,549
I should get outside more often.

22
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,450
Harrison, I came here to talk.

23
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,585
Okay, someone dies, asks for help,
and you repeat a day.

24
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:34,251
There, we talked.

25
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:36,659
Not quite what I meant by talking.

26
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,959
We all have our things:

27
00:01:39,032 --> 00:01:41,865
Meredith has her drugs,
I have....

28
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,733
I got everything else.

29
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:47,630
And you got this:

30
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:51,642
your strange belief that you go back a day
and save innocent lives.

31
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:53,804
I know where it comes from.

32
00:01:54,881 --> 00:01:57,475
No one expected you to save her, Tru.

33
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,680
This is not about our mother.

34
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:02,277
I took a semester of psych
back in high school.

35
00:02:02,355 --> 00:02:04,846
It's always about
someone's mother.

36
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:09,789
Maybe you should just try
and leave the past alone.

37
00:02:11,097 --> 00:02:12,462
I can't...

38
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,798
because it won't leave me alone.

39
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,076
Help me.

40
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:04,646
Who would have thought of hiding
the spare under the doormat?

41
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,153
You might consider a lighting fixture.
Both unique and efficient.

42
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,155
Please tell me you brought coffee.

43
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,054
Blueberry Danish,
tuna, dry on whole- wheat...

44
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,960
and a veggie burrito
from that place you like on Larkin.

45
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,466
With your bizarre hours, I couldn't decide
what meal you'd be on by now.

46
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,330
You are a good woman.

47
00:03:22,502 --> 00:03:24,231
So, how are you?

48
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:28,337
- Pick a subject.
- I'll take"Boys" for $200.

49
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:33,609
Okay, I know Evans didn't end well,
but you have to get back out there.

50
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,511
I just read
in a very legitimate publication...

51
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,177
that one out of every seven guys
is a keeper.

52
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:41,447
More like one in a million.

53
00:03:42,989 --> 00:03:44,786
Look, I gotta shower.

54
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:48,088
Is there anything you want to say to me?

55
00:03:48,661 --> 00:03:51,391
Yes. Thank you for my breakfast goodies.

56
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:53,288
You're welcome.

57
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,360
That's what friends are for.

58
00:04:09,849 --> 00:04:11,009
Nasty.

59
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,242
Tru.

60
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,665
Gardez?

61
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,064
Oh, my God!

62
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,277
Is everything all right here?

63
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:44,782
Yeah, Gardez is an ass.
Everything's normal.

64
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,911
- You should've seen the look on her face.
- Hysterical.

65
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:49,978
Tru, come on. Lighten up.

66
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:54,593
Looks like I got a pickup. A real one.

67
00:04:57,163 --> 00:05:00,064
- You okay?
- Yeah, whatever.

68
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:03,558
Davis, do you think he's right?

69
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,138
Do you think
I take everything too seriously?

70
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:08,173
Gardez sees dead bodies.

71
00:05:08,675 --> 00:05:12,577
You see the people they used to be.
He doesn't understand that.

72
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,477
But you do?

73
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,177
Just don't let him get to you.

74
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,387
Hi, come on in.

75
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,595
I know we're all working late
these days, Meredith...

76
00:05:35,702 --> 00:05:37,431
but the firm's board is insisting...

77
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,631
that we implement a random
drug- testing program for our employees.

78
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,764
Now?

79
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:46,945
Unbelievable. Can I have my assistant
back when he's done?

80
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:50,746
Actually, we're all being tested.
Liability issue.

81
00:05:54,153 --> 00:05:57,520
Just check in at the table
in front of the restrooms.

82
00:05:58,224 --> 00:05:59,589
Yeah, sure.

83
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,158
Nice.

84
00:06:13,172 --> 00:06:15,140
Did I do that yesterday?

85
00:06:15,274 --> 00:06:16,400
Harrison.

86
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:19,639
It's a reasonable question,
for someone like you.

87
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,474
- You gotta admit, it's frigging weird.
- I told you, not every day repeats.

88
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,518
In fact, most of them don't.
That's too bad.

89
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,579
'Cause if your little fantasy was real,
today would be a hell of a day to do over.

90
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,921
- What do you mean?
- You know, the whole Meredith thing.

91
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,227
She didn't tell you?

92
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,525
Drug test at her office today.

93
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:40,757
She failed it and they fired her.

94
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,301
Oh, my God.
So you see my point?

95
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,803
You could actually go back today,
bail Meredith out...

96
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:49,700
and we wouldn't be
having this conversation.

97
00:06:49,809 --> 00:06:52,073
Harrison, I can't control when it happens.

98
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,443
So what do we do?
Nothing tonight.

99
00:06:54,514 --> 00:06:57,813
We'll check in with her tomorrow.
See how she's doing.

100
00:06:58,851 --> 00:07:02,309
What if tomorrow is just today
all over again?

101
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,383
Bite me, Harrison.

102
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:07,356
Can I ask you a question?

103
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,088
Sure, Davis, anything.

104
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:11,562
Does this lab coat make me look portly?

105
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,690
No, you look fine.

106
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,735
I just overheard you mention
that black was more....

107
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:18,236
I think you called it"slimming."

108
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:21,398
I was gonna see
if they came in a different color, maybe.

109
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,805
Gardez must have been driving
all over the city.

110
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,405
Actually, they all came in
on the same pickup.

111
00:07:30,483 --> 00:07:33,452
It's five dead males, mid- to- late- 20s.

112
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:36,852
Time of death is between 10:30 and 1 1:00.

113
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,257
I lifted the personals,
if you want to start bagging.

114
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,720
Any lDs?
Wallets were missing.

115
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:49,831
The prelim tox report shows four of them
had pretty high levels of alcohol.

116
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,632
Enough to kill them?
Probably not.

117
00:07:52,738 --> 00:07:55,229
But there is something strange
about this fifth guy.

118
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:57,605
He had no alcohol in his system...

119
00:07:57,677 --> 00:08:00,874
but he did have a trace
of a chemical called Avlocardyl.

120
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:02,608
One of them was married.

121
00:08:02,715 --> 00:08:05,513
That's a shame.
What else can you tell me?

122
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,582
And one of them was making friends.

123
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,469
Is there anything you want to say to me?

124
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,067
I suck.

125
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,571
Hello.

126
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:38,011
- I'm looking for Gardez. Is he....
- Out on a pickup.

127
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,385
Can I take a message?
Sure, yeah.

128
00:08:42,154 --> 00:08:45,453
I'm a friend of a friend.
He hooked me up with a job interview...

129
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,117
and in case I don't get the gig...

130
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,388
I thought I'd thank him
while I was still in town.

131
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:52,829
Job interview. Those are always fun.
What was it for?

132
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:55,362
Photographer.
Postmortem?

133
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:58,331
Crime scene. Upstairs. Sheriff's office.

134
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:01,099
Right, of course. How'd it go?

135
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,841
I don't know.

136
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:05,441
I was meeting with the Sheriff
about half an hour.

137
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,674
Then I walked out and realized
I had something stuck in my teeth.

138
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:09,976
Sexy.

139
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,608
I'm not sure the Sheriff thought so.

140
00:09:14,954 --> 00:09:17,616
I should get your name for the message.

141
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,817
It's Luc, with a"C."

142
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,589
Tru, with a"U."

143
00:09:22,662 --> 00:09:24,687
Is this man bothering you?

144
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,189
Yes, Davis. Please have him escorted
from the building.

145
00:09:29,635 --> 00:09:30,829
Really?
No.

146
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:33,770
- Davis, this is Luc.
- Yeah, we met earlier.

147
00:09:33,873 --> 00:09:37,570
I got lost on my way to the interview.
Thanks for the directions.

148
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:42,171
I'm sure Gardez will be back pretty soon,
if you just want to hang out till--

149
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,476
<i>HeIp me. </i>

150
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:48,215
You okay?

151
00:09:48,888 --> 00:09:52,949
Yeah, I'm fine. I just have to--
<i>HeIp me. </i>

152
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:03,535
Would you mind waiting here
for one second?

153
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,097
I just need to....I'm sorry.

154
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,698
Excuse me, Davis.

155
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,277
She does that a lot.

156
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,301
- Help me.
- Save us.

157
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,909
- We need you.

158
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,673
- Please.

159
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:50,076
- Help me.

160
00:11:01,627 --> 00:11:05,119
Who would have thought of putting
the spare key under the doormat?

161
00:11:05,197 --> 00:11:06,596
Very clever.

162
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,561
Okay, so I brought you....

163
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,729
Blueberry Danish, tuna on whole- wheat,
and a veggie burrito?

164
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:17,002
- Okay, how'd you know that?
- The same way I know it's your birthday.

165
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:19,503
My God, you remembered.

166
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,573
<i>The sad thing is no one eIse did. </i>

167
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,678
- Thank you.
- Of course. How could I forget?

168
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,488
Harrison, I don't need you to believe me.
I just need your help.

169
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:41,260
This is the first time it wasn't
just one body asking for help. It was five.

170
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,699
I didn't see their faces,
they came with no lDs...

171
00:11:43,803 --> 00:11:46,897
which means it's gonna be
five times harder for me to save them.

172
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,166
I gotta be honest.

173
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,435
It's early in the day
to have this conversation.

174
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:54,309
I think one of them was poisoned, but
I've no idea what happened to the others.

175
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:57,975
- And you're telling me this because....
- Because I need info...

176
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:00,245
and you're more familiar with this world
than I am.

177
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:03,413
Listen, Starsky,
if you're asking me to be your Hutch...

178
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:06,424
I'm gonna have to say,
"Thanks, but no, thanks."

179
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,953
Strippers, Harr?

180
00:12:12,098 --> 00:12:13,998
Okay. I'm in.

181
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:25,034
I was wondering if you could tell me
where I could find a girl named Turquoise?

182
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,479
We don't give that information
to customers.

183
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,744
- I'm not really a customer.
- You here to audition?

184
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:34,911
- Do I look like a stripper to you?
- A little bit.

185
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,253
I thought you said
bartenders knew everything.

186
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,127
I got nowhere with that guy.

187
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:49,599
- Did you work it?
- What do you mean"work it"?

188
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:52,764
You gotta have an angle
to get information, Tru.

189
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:55,500
By the way,
that Turquoise girl you're looking for?

190
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,836
Her real name is Tara.

191
00:12:56,909 --> 00:12:59,901
She's got a day job doing telemarketing
in the Hancock Building.

192
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,105
No way!

193
00:13:01,914 --> 00:13:05,475
Come on, Tru.
You know I got a way with the ladies.

194
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,149
<i>My friend here toId me everything. </i>

195
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,417
Harrison, thank you. Seriously.
I'll call you later, okay?

196
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,857
Right, yeah. I'm right behind you.
I'm just gonna....

197
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:20,396
I'm just gonna stay, and check it out here.
What's up?

198
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,697
She's right over there.

199
00:13:24,937 --> 00:13:27,804
I just need to take down
your information.

200
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,443
- Tara?
- Yes.

201
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,743
Hi, I'm putting together a little party...

202
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:39,842
and was wondering
if you were booked for the night?

203
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,252
- I'm sorry?
- Or are you working at the club?

204
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,693
Why are you coming in here
and asking me questions like that?

205
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:52,060
I'm sorry, my bad.

206
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:53,894
I didn't know how--
It's okay.

207
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:58,494
It's just that no one here
really knows what my other job is.

208
00:13:59,138 --> 00:14:00,230
I can relate.

209
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,967
But anyway, I am booked for the night.

210
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:07,244
Got an out- call gig.
Some bachelor party at the Pierpont.

211
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,110
A bachelor party.

212
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,649
Would you happen to know
who hired you?

213
00:14:11,717 --> 00:14:14,379
Everything's handled by a booking service.

214
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:17,479
- Right.
- Look, I gotta get back to work.

215
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,882
Good luck with whatever it is
you're planning.

216
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,025
Can I help you?
I'm here about the bachelor party.

217
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:29,431
Right, Room 1712. It's called for 7:00...

218
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:33,301
but the entertainment
doesn't usually get here until after dark.

219
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,704
Why does everyone think
I look like a stripper?

220
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:38,675
It's a bachelor party.
Who else would you be?

221
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:40,405
Right, good point.

222
00:14:40,646 --> 00:14:43,513
So help me out, you know,
to know what to expect.

223
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,779
Is there anyone else working the party?
A waiter, bartender?

224
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:49,150
They've declined those options.

225
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:52,290
So no one but the guests
will be in the room tonight?

226
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,826
- And you.
- And me.

227
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,420
And one more thing.

228
00:14:56,495 --> 00:15:00,158
I had a question for the groom,
but I can't seem to find his number.

229
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:03,793
It's not our practice
to give out guests' personal information.

230
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:07,999
Too bad. He hadn't decided
whether he wants me naughty or nice.

231
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:14,539
There's no way
I'll cancel my bachelor party.

232
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:17,514
- It's my last night of freedom.
- No, you don't understand.

233
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,313
No, I think I do.
Robin sent you, didn't she?

234
00:15:20,386 --> 00:15:21,410
No, that's not--

235
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,318
She hates it that I'm having this party...

236
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:26,017
almost as much as she hates
the guys I invited.

237
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,820
Robin's not a fan of your friends?

238
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,918
Okay, now this is starting to freak me out.

239
00:15:29,995 --> 00:15:32,361
If Robin didn't send you,
then who the hell are you?

240
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,298
I'm with the hotel,
and there's a problem with your room, sir.

241
00:15:35,367 --> 00:15:38,427
So they sent me personally
to explain the situation.

242
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:41,028
- What's wrong with the room?
- We're overbooked.

243
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:44,507
It has been way too long
since these guys have gotten together.

244
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:47,136
There's nothing that's gonna get me
to call this off.

245
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,702
Right, but--
Know what?

246
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,443
I'll just call the hotel manager
and straighten this out.

247
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:54,509
No need.
I'm sure we can figure something out.

248
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,752
Avlocardyl? This newfound fascination...

249
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:01,315
- with this obscure drug stems from--
- Homework.

250
00:16:01,393 --> 00:16:03,054
Just studying for the MCATs.

251
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:05,926
I can save you a lot of time.
This will never be on the test.

252
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,523
- I like to be really prepared.
- Okay.

253
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:13,401
Avlocardyl is a white, odorless,
crystalline powder that's soluble in water.

254
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:15,097
- Is that better?
- Much.

255
00:16:15,207 --> 00:16:17,971
So it can be ingested
without the victim's knowledge?

256
00:16:18,043 --> 00:16:21,308
In a liquid, yes. But what victim?

257
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:24,543
Is there any way to tell if someone
has Avlocardyl in their system?

258
00:16:24,616 --> 00:16:27,141
Not right away.
But after two or three hours, sure.

259
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,187
- How?
- They'd be dead.

260
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:33,118
I think there's something in the drinks.
Only that makes sense.

261
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,457
I have to replace all the alcohol
in the suite before the boys arrive.

262
00:16:36,528 --> 00:16:38,155
Then I have to find out who put it there.

263
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:40,357
Yeah, and this involves me how?

264
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:43,230
I need you to find a girl.
Her name is Robin Wilson.

265
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:47,228
- Jackpot. That I can do.
<i>I got her name off a bridaI registry. </i>

266
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,432
She's gonna get married in a week--

267
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,166
Rewind. Married?

268
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:53,340
Look, Tru, I got my hands full, you know?

269
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,346
<i>You've been having fun aII day. </i>

270
00:16:55,414 --> 00:16:58,850
Five guys are gonna be dead by 10:30
if I don't find a way to stop it.

271
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,613
Do I have to list the number of times
I've bailed you out...

272
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,622
- because I'm running out of time here.
- Fine.

273
00:17:04,723 --> 00:17:07,715
But playing the guilt card's
really not like you, Tru.

274
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:09,954
You're starting to sound
like somebody else.

275
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,690
Who?
<i>Meredith. </i>

276
00:17:16,668 --> 00:17:18,898
To what do I owe the pleasure?

277
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,832
Can't a girl hang out with her sister?

278
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,205
Yeah, as long as her sister's not
in the middle of a huge case, which she is.

279
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:26,869
Mere, I just....

280
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:31,612
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, like I said, just busy.

281
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,782
With you, I mean.
Is everything okay with you?

282
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,151
I love you. You know that, right?

283
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,623
So don't take it too hard
when I tell you to kiss my--

284
00:17:43,695 --> 00:17:47,062
Tru, you have three looks:
One is,"Have you heard from Harrison?"

285
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:51,068
Two is,"I miss Mom."
And three is,"Are you clean, Meredith?"

286
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:56,096
And judging by the downcast eyes,
I'm gonna go with Number Three.

287
00:17:57,943 --> 00:18:01,572
I'm clean, Tru.
My last slip- up was over a month ago.

288
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,706
It's in the past. God, leave it there.

289
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,773
What if, I don't know...

290
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:10,884
there were a random drug test today.
It could happen. Would you pass?

291
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,819
This is ridiculous.

292
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:16,517
I'd pass, Tru.

293
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,693
That's good to hear.

294
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,100
Sorry for doubting you.

295
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,141
She's not with you?

296
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,613
I figured since it was Lindsay's birthday,
she might be with her sister.

297
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:38,509
All right. Thanks, anyway. Bye.

298
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,735
Hello? Housekeeping.

299
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,446
I have to replace all the alcohol
in the suite.

300
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:35,038
Here she is.

301
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,542
Sweet.
Yeah, it's nice.

302
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,805
What are you doing?

303
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:48,144
- I'm the bartender.
Nice.

304
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:52,350
This room is sick!

305
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:56,053
Nice to see you again.
I didn't know you were the bartender.

306
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,529
That's funny,
I could've sworn I didn't ask for one.

307
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,587
You didn't.

308
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:04,124
The hotel threw me in gratis
to make up for the problem with the room.

309
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,294
Nice.

310
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:09,062
- Anyway, what would you like?
Scotch. Straight.

311
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,943
Gentlemen, a toast.
Yes.

312
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:17,144
To the best night of our lives.

313
00:20:18,417 --> 00:20:19,406
<i>Cheers. </i>

314
00:20:22,521 --> 00:20:23,988
Sorry I'm late.

315
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,552
You know, as a rule,
the best man should never be late.

316
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:32,290
No one ever said I was the best.
I'm just better than the rest of you idiots.

317
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,424
Look at this guy.
Come here.

318
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,934
Yeah, what's up?

319
00:20:46,044 --> 00:20:48,569
A sixth guy just showed up.
<i>So? </i>

320
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,305
Only five bodies came into the morgue.

321
00:20:53,118 --> 00:20:56,451
Somebody here doesn't die.
<i>Let's say you're not crazy. </i>

322
00:20:56,521 --> 00:20:57,988
So the sixth guy did it?

323
00:20:58,056 --> 00:21:00,490
No, I never saw any of their faces.

324
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:03,992
It means any one of them could've done it.

325
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,890
<i>Whoever didn't come in dead, </i>
<i>that's the kiIIer. </i>

326
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:27,814
That's a hell of a pour, girl.

327
00:21:27,886 --> 00:21:31,720
You do know that Seven and Seven
isn't seven shots of alcohol, right?

328
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,351
Of course. You think this is my first day?

329
00:21:34,426 --> 00:21:36,986
What's going on?
You look rough. Things okay?

330
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,394
I've just been going through some stuff.

331
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:42,763
A night out with the boys
is probably just what you need. Thank you.

332
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:45,928
You don't think it's wrong,
all of us being here together?

333
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:48,768
I think what's wrong
is you bringing that up.

334
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,866
<i>Why don't you just reIax, </i>
<i>have another drink, and just chiII out? </i>

335
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,207
<i>AII that stuff is in the past. </i>

336
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,772
- Can I get you something?
- No, I'll get it myself.

337
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:26,436
You don't want any of that, trust me.
The hotel always buys the cheap stuff.

338
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:30,780
We need to teach you to appreciate
a smooth, well- aged scotch.

339
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,349
So, John says you're a gift
from the hotel.

340
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:37,755
Be sure
to tell your manager thanks.

341
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,757
- No problem.
- Better yet...

342
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,386
why don't you give me his name?
I'd like to do it myself.

343
00:22:43,662 --> 00:22:47,120
Actually, he's probably home
with the wife and kids by now.

344
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:51,693
But if I do my job right, I'll make sure
he finds you first thing in the morning.

345
00:22:53,271 --> 00:22:54,295
<i>Go! </i>

346
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:59,643
<i>Now do the other one. </i>
<i>Do the other one. </i>

347
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,976
Hey, who brought this? Ethan? Cordoza?

348
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:36,306
Hello, boys. Entertainment's here.

349
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:41,451
I'm gonna go get a little more comfortable.

350
00:23:41,686 --> 00:23:44,211
<i>Why don't you aII do the same thing? </i>

351
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:49,751
Shake this way.

352
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,729
All right!

353
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,525
Everything okay?

354
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,468
I mean, can I get you a cocktail?

355
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:03,300
How about a club soda
made to look like a vodka and soda?

356
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,073
Okay. You driving or something?

357
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:10,039
- No, I'm just sober. Eighteen months.
- Congrats.

358
00:24:10,515 --> 00:24:12,915
I used to drink pretty hardcore
back in the day.

359
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:15,282
That's how I dealt with things.

360
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,188
But I don't want to bring everybody down,
you know?

361
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,224
I'd rather keep it quiet.

362
00:24:20,392 --> 00:24:22,519
<i>No traces of aIcohoI in his system. </i>

363
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,125
Don't worry. It'll be our little secret.

364
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:28,132
Thanks. Cheers.

365
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,743
Would carbonation
speed up the effects of Avlocardyl?

366
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,114
I'm doing great, thanks.

367
00:24:47,185 --> 00:24:50,382
Did you know if you squeeze
all the bacteria out of the intestines...

368
00:24:50,455 --> 00:24:52,047
you have enough to fill a coffee mug?

369
00:24:52,123 --> 00:24:54,387
Hello, Davis. Now about my question?

370
00:24:54,459 --> 00:24:57,189
Carbonation. Not that I know of.

371
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,861
<i>I don't think....</i>

372
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,492
Are you at a party?

373
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:05,901
I'm guessing
this isn't the Sheriff's office, is it?

374
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,837
Hold on a second.
It's down the hall, up the stairs.

375
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:09,896
<i>Is that Luc? </i>

376
00:25:10,275 --> 00:25:14,109
- Wish him luck on his interview.
- Good luck on your interview.

377
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:15,704
Thanks.

378
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,771
And tell him to check his teeth.

379
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,682
<i>Is he a friend of yours? </i>
- Could be. Just tell him.

380
00:25:21,386 --> 00:25:22,717
Excuse me.

381
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,122
You may want to check your teeth.

382
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:27,919
Thanks.

383
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:33,892
So, what about alcohol?
How does it react with Avlocardyl?

384
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,023
<i>It wouIdn't. </i>

385
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:38,797
Alcohol acts as a masking agent,
covering all signs of the drug in the body.

386
00:25:38,904 --> 00:25:42,567
So, say I would take a swig,
and then have three or four martinis.

387
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,767
<i>ShouId I be concerned with-- </i>
- It's a simple question.

388
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:50,439
Avlocardyl plus liquor equals a dead body
with no traceable cause of death.

389
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:52,343
They were all poisoned.

390
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,614
The alcohol covered it up.
Thanks for the assist.

391
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,289
Go!

392
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:09,327
Looks like somebody's married.

393
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,995
Yeah, he's got a kid on the way, too.

394
00:26:24,516 --> 00:26:26,484
<i>It means any one of them couId've done it. </i>

395
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:44,931
You don't look so hot.

396
00:26:45,036 --> 00:26:48,267
If I didn't know you weren't drinking,
I'd cut you off.

397
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:51,604
I needed some air. It's a tough room.

398
00:26:53,678 --> 00:26:56,738
You guys haven't seen each other
since college, right?

399
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,909
I mean, shouldn't this be
one big, happy reunion?

400
00:27:00,085 --> 00:27:03,646
Right. Everyone says
they're the best years of your life.

401
00:27:05,724 --> 00:27:08,192
It doesn't always work out that way.

402
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,624
Are you okay?

403
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:14,825
Just some things I wish
I could go back and undo, you know?

404
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:16,264
<i>Make right. </i>

405
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,794
Do you ever feel that way?

406
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,773
All the time.

407
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:29,241
Maybe some of these guys
can deal with what happened but....

408
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:33,011
What? Did something happen
back in college?

409
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:36,315
- We didn't even know her name.
- Who?

410
00:27:38,289 --> 00:27:40,223
The girl from the video?

411
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:42,486
Hey, buddy.
Hey, Blake.

412
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,084
Where you been?

413
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,121
I bought you a lap dance.

414
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:50,290
She's waiting on you. Get in there.

415
00:27:56,641 --> 00:27:58,700
I think your break is over.

416
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:04,171
Hi, come on in.

417
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,882
I know we're all working late
these days, Meredith...

418
00:28:06,951 --> 00:28:09,146
but the firm's board is insisting...

419
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,122
that we implement a random
drug- testing program for our employees.

420
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,791
Unbelievable.

421
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:17,259
Anyway, it shouldn't take
more than a few minutes.

422
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:20,593
If you want to check in at the table
in front of the restrooms.

423
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:22,030
Yeah, sure.

424
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,601
No, that's fine. Her name's not Lenny.

425
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:35,439
Don't worry, you've got two hours
to scrape the frosting off and start over.

426
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:38,482
Hey, we're taking up a collection
to keep the party moving.

427
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:41,075
- You seen Blake?
- No.

428
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,623
Oh, she's all snuggly.

429
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,658
<i>They aII got girIfriends, sweetheart. </i>

430
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:07,706
- What are you--
- You want to tell me what this is?

431
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:11,215
I was trying to keep track of your orders.
I was forgetting--

432
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,445
I checked with the hotel.
No record of them sending a bartender.

433
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:18,387
- More importantly, no record of you.
- All right. Nice work. I'm busted.

434
00:29:18,456 --> 00:29:21,254
I'm calling security
and having your ass thrown out of here.

435
00:29:21,326 --> 00:29:23,794
Hey, knock it off! I said, stop!

436
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,727
Get your hands off me.

437
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,126
Come on, it's a party.

438
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:31,691
- You think that's funny? You're sick.
- It's fine. He didn't mean it.

439
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,671
Settle down. I think you're blowing this
out of proportion.

440
00:29:34,739 --> 00:29:38,641
You know what, I'm just gonna
take a couple of minutes. Cool down.

441
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:44,946
Nice work.

442
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,086
Tara, are you....
Wait, what are you doing?

443
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:55,683
You ask too many questions.
Get out.

444
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,985
Listen, don't do this.

445
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,891
How did you know?

446
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,029
<i>WaIIets were missing. </i>

447
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:09,171
- You're just ripping them off?
- What did you think I was doing?

448
00:30:10,241 --> 00:30:13,870
Look, I have never done this before,
I swear.

449
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:17,480
- Are you gonna call the cops?
No.

450
00:30:22,754 --> 00:30:25,188
- What's that?
- Tequila.

451
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,221
I didn't bring tequila.

452
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:31,353
I found it behind the bar.
I've been drinking it since I got here.

453
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:37,465
Wait a second.
If it's not in the alcohol, then what's it in?

454
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,695
Oh, my God.

455
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:42,239
<i>There's something in the drinks. </i>

456
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:44,375
<i>A vIocardyI is soIubIe in water. </i>

457
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,537
The ice.

458
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,236
<i>It's in the ice. </i>

459
00:30:57,622 --> 00:31:00,386
- Davis, it's me.
- For information, please dial 41 1.

460
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:02,289
Just one more question, I promise.

461
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:05,557
Is there any way to save a person
once Avlocardyl's in their system?

462
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:08,258
<i>That must be some party. </i>
<i>Let me check. </i>

463
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,463
Yeah, and it looks like
glucagon is the only known antidote.

464
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,061
Do we have it at the morgue?

465
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:16,572
Glucagon is a substitute for insulin...

466
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:19,973
<i>in diabetic emergencies, </i>
<i>so we might have it in the med kit. </i>

467
00:31:20,411 --> 00:31:22,777
- I think it's time you left.
- Hello?

468
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:24,915
Wait, you can't. You don't understand.

469
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,348
- Something is gonna happen.
That's right.

470
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,251
You're gonna be escorted
from the building.

471
00:31:32,023 --> 00:31:33,991
You're making a mistake.

472
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,043
I'm impressed.

473
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,042
You scared the hell out of me.

474
00:31:57,348 --> 00:32:01,182
It took me four months
before I stole anything from the office.

475
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:04,487
Davis, I'm sorry--

476
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,450
Tru, don't.

477
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:10,051
I've been listening to
your mildly entertaining stories all day.

478
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:14,727
Obviously, something's up in your life.
I don't know if you're in trouble.

479
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:19,293
I just hope that one day you'll realize
you can be honest with me.

480
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:06,277
- Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
- Maybe I wasn't listening.

481
00:33:06,351 --> 00:33:10,117
I know something happened in college
and what you're willing to do to cover up.

482
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:13,316
No one knows anything
except the five guys in that room.

483
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:16,052
What happened to the girl? Who was she?

484
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:19,563
- You can't hide from the past.
- Don't you think I know that?

485
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:22,890
Was it Ethan? What did he say?

486
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:25,026
No, nothing. He just....

487
00:33:28,239 --> 00:33:29,263
lce.

488
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:35,007
I thought it was you,
but you didn't plan tonight, did you?

489
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,240
No. What does that have to do
with anything?

490
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,508
<i>Don't know</i>
<i>what you're up to...</i>

491
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,021
but I finally found Robin Wilson.
Only she isn't any bride.

492
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,282
- Who's that?
- What?

493
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:47,119
Get off the phone. Now.

494
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:50,160
She caught the guy cheating on her,
called the wedding off.

495
00:33:50,228 --> 00:33:52,526
- That was three months ago.
- Right.

496
00:33:53,898 --> 00:33:56,423
You've got 10 seconds to explain yourself.

497
00:33:56,501 --> 00:33:58,526
This isn't a bachelor party, Blake.

498
00:33:58,603 --> 00:34:00,764
The wedding was called off months ago.

499
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,238
That's crazy.
Why else would John want us all here?

500
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:06,208
Because you share a secret
he doesn't want you to tell.

501
00:34:06,277 --> 00:34:10,737
Whatever happened in college, whatever
happened to that girl, it was John.

502
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:13,248
John did it.

503
00:34:16,754 --> 00:34:18,346
Let me help you.

504
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,328
What's she still doing here?
I thought I told you to get rid of her.

505
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,099
She's got an interesting story
you all might want to hear.

506
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:38,607
Not to be a pain in the ass,
but we had her thrown out.

507
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:43,547
- Now you want us to listen to her?
- I think we've all been silent long enough.

508
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,577
This isn't a bachelor party.

509
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,987
Not anymore.

510
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:55,856
You scared off the stripper,
we're running out of booze--

511
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,461
John and his fiancée broke up months ago.

512
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,865
Any of you guys know that?

513
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:06,531
Is that true, John?

514
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:10,500
Look, I can explain everything.

515
00:35:15,513 --> 00:35:16,980
Come on, guys.

516
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,745
The best night of our lives, remember?

517
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:29,993
Thanks, guys.

518
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,957
- No, don't.
- Just give me a minute.

519
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:41,629
Going somewhere?

520
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:44,966
What's the point in hanging around?

521
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:47,601
You embarrassed me
in front of my friends.

522
00:35:47,712 --> 00:35:49,771
They can't be that good friends, John.

523
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:52,782
They still thought
you were getting married.

524
00:35:55,253 --> 00:35:57,585
It's not exactly an easy thing...

525
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,882
to admit that your relationship failed,
you know?

526
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,960
I was gonna tell them all tonight.

527
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,490
I thought everybody
could use a good party.

528
00:36:09,567 --> 00:36:11,432
With plenty of drinks.

529
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,866
On the rocks, right?

530
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,005
God, that's a long way to go
to cover up a murder.

531
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:21,374
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Let me fill you in on a few things.

532
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:25,176
The first is one of your friends
wasn't drinking alcohol tonight.

533
00:36:25,316 --> 00:36:28,513
So, sure,
he's got the Avlocardyl in his system...

534
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,850
but without the alcohol to hide it...

535
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:34,358
at some point,
someone's gonna figure out what you did.

536
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:38,757
And second,
it's a little bartending trick I picked up.

537
00:36:39,397 --> 00:36:41,957
Even if you're drinking it straight,
like you...

538
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,796
if you want to keep the drink cool...

539
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:47,065
you shake a little crushed ice
in the bottom of the glass.

540
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:49,829
<i>Yes, every gIass, John. </i>

541
00:36:50,308 --> 00:36:52,572
Of course, if you didn't mess with the ice...

542
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:56,841
then you won't need the antidote
your best man has in the next room.

543
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,915
- Five years late.
That's what I don't get.

544
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:36,413
Why now, after all this time?

545
00:37:36,554 --> 00:37:39,853
Three weeks ago, I sent him a letter
saying I was going to the police.

546
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,982
You?

547
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:44,019
I couldn't take it anymore...

548
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:48,256
and I tried to make it right.
lnstead, I almost got us all killed.

549
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:49,822
What happened?

550
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,793
Catherine Hill.

551
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:59,468
We didn't even know her name
until we read it in the papers.

552
00:37:59,577 --> 00:38:03,741
She was a freshman, made the mistake
of coming to a graduation party.

553
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,382
<i>John got her aIone in a room. </i>

554
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,680
It's a little close, isn't it?

555
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:12,714
That hurts. Stop it. I told you, no!

556
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,789
- Who said it was up to you?
- Let go of me.

557
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,229
A girlfriend once said he slapped her.

558
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,838
He denied it and we believed him.

559
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,700
When he told us what happened that night
was an accident, we didn't believe him.

560
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,711
<i>We didn't say anything. </i>

561
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:38,713
<i>To anybody. </i>

562
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,977
And you sent a letter? That's something.

563
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,146
I didn't have the guts to sign it.

564
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:46,655
He didn't know which one of us
was turning him in.

565
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,919
So he had to kill all of you.

566
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,830
I'm sorry for not trusting you.
But with everything...

567
00:38:54,565 --> 00:38:56,430
I barely trust myself.

568
00:38:57,768 --> 00:38:59,736
You did the right thing.

569
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,101
Five years too late.

570
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:27,526
Surprise!

571
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,166
Surprise!

572
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,344
Tru.

573
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,165
- You need something?
- How'd you know?

574
00:40:16,347 --> 00:40:18,611
You take the fun out of everything.

575
00:40:18,682 --> 00:40:20,343
It was fun for me.

576
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:25,045
Hello?

577
00:40:25,122 --> 00:40:29,183
I'm sure you won't be surprised to hear
there was a drug test at my office.

578
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,725
Obviously, you knew something
and opted not to tell me...

579
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:37,063
so I just called specifically
to not say"thank you."

580
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:40,760
<i>But in case you're curious, </i>
<i>I passed the test. </i>

581
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:44,934
Maybe now you'll get off my back
and let my past stay in the past.

582
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:48,976
Meredith, I wasn't trying to prove a point.
I was just trying to help.

583
00:40:49,046 --> 00:40:51,640
- And I did, didn't I?
- Good night, Tru.

584
00:40:57,655 --> 00:41:00,215
- You wanted to see me?
- Close the door.

585
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:06,894
Thanks for covering that
for me.

586
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:09,197
No problem.

587
00:41:09,533 --> 00:41:12,627
I've never been paid
to provide a sample before.

588
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:18,172
But I gotta ask, how did you know
there was gonna be a drug test today?

589
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:21,107
I just had a feeling.

590
00:41:28,686 --> 00:41:30,244
I just don't get it.

591
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:33,051
I went through all this
to save these five guys...

592
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,957
and now there's a chance they'll go to jail.
What's the point?

593
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,626
Look, Tru, this thing you're dealing with....

594
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,068
Maybe for you,
it's about more than just saving people.

595
00:41:45,569 --> 00:41:49,027
See, these guys had a secret,
and they put it to rest.

596
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:51,040
Maybe, I don't know....

597
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:53,976
Maybe you can try and do the same.

598
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,374
So Lindsay has this theory.

599
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:01,680
One out of every seven guys is a good one.

600
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:05,313
I've spent an entire evening
with six guys that were bad.

601
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:07,619
So does that make you Number Seven?

602
00:42:09,226 --> 00:42:10,955
I wouldn't bet on it.

603
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,456
Don't worry, Tru.

604
00:42:14,298 --> 00:42:15,822
He's out there.

605
00:42:32,082 --> 00:42:33,549
You know him?

606
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,116
No, not yet.
