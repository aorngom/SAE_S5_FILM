1
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:51,550
<i>Tru? </i>
Yes.

2
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:54,416
<i>It's okay, Tru. </i>
Okay, Mommy.

3
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,758
Before her time, to a person....

4
00:01:01,828 --> 00:01:03,887
- She forgave me.
- What?

5
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:05,794
- Who?
- Mom.

6
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,493
She forgave me
for not being able to help her...

7
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,432
and she said she's okay.

8
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,897
You have a vivid imagination.

9
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:15,634
But Mom was murdered, in front of you.

10
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,134
What part of that is okay?

11
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:21,171
...a wife and mother...

12
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:24,412
taken before her time.

13
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,877
God, he's so full of crap.

14
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:30,685
l just wish--
You just wish what?

15
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:33,955
That l could go back to that day
and help her.

16
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,392
You can't.

17
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,388
None of us can.

18
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:43,393
"A time to be born,
and a time to die."

19
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:51,102
Hey, the garbage man says
the elevator's out again.

20
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:52,144
Elevator's out.

21
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:53,904
<i>Dominick Barren. </i>

22
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:02,286
<i>EIizabeth Christianson. </i>

23
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:12,891
<i>Tru Davies. </i>

24
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,333
Where is she?

25
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,762
<i>Tru Davies. </i>

26
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,351
l've got a drinking game.

27
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,883
lt's called"You graduated from college
and your family didn't show up."

28
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,658
A drinking game, or"Next on Dr. Phil"?

29
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:49,598
l'm so sorry, Tru. l know
they missed all your track meets, but....

30
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:53,001
To be expected.
Harrison probably met a girl...

31
00:02:53,072 --> 00:02:55,939
Meredith probably met a client,
and my father....

32
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,342
No acknowledgment of children
from his first marriage.

33
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,613
Thanks, Cameron, but l think l'm out.

34
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,377
- Already? But we just got here.
- What?

35
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,850
lnternship starts tomorrow at the hospital.

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,788
l thought l'd make a nice first impression
by not showing up hung over.

37
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:15,950
Tru? Prof. Evans.

38
00:03:16,629 --> 00:03:19,120
Lindsay, would you stop it already?

39
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:21,400
She thinks l've got a thing for him.

40
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,868
But l've told her,
professors aren't exactly my type.

41
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,271
Good night, guys.
And congratulations. We made it.

42
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:49,417
Unbelievable.

43
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:51,757
Congratulations.

44
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:53,958
Yesterday, you were an ethics violation...

45
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,662
and today you are a faculty girlfriend.

46
00:04:00,306 --> 00:04:03,935
l meant what l said, Tru. Now that
you graduated, we could go public.

47
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:06,604
l'm sure the Dean
will be very happy to hear it.

48
00:04:06,679 --> 00:04:09,546
Well, the Dean's opinion
no longer matters.

49
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:13,211
ln fact, l'm gonna see her tonight
at the faculty banquet.

50
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,880
Maybe it's time l told her about you.

51
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:18,316
What are you gonna say?
Not a word.

52
00:04:18,391 --> 00:04:21,690
l'm just gonna show her
those Polaroids that l took.

53
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,203
<i>HeIIo, and weIcome to</i>
<i>another</i> Monday Morning Money.

54
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:34,404
Hello?
<i>Tru, it's your favorite brother. </i>

55
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,868
l'm in a bit of a situation.

56
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:40,634
What's it this time, Harrison?
Don't tell me you played cards all night.

57
00:04:40,713 --> 00:04:42,271
No, not all night.

58
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:44,674
Just since 2:00.

59
00:04:44,884 --> 00:04:48,752
Look, whatever you have would help,
$1, 000, $200 even.

60
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,880
<i>It's just a Ioan. </i>

61
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,254
<i>I'm teIIing you, Tru. I am on a streak today. </i>

62
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:55,886
lf you're on a streak,
why do you need to borrow money?

63
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,692
<i>You know I don't have that kind of cash. </i>

64
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:01,757
l have to get to the hospital.
But l'll see you tonight, right?

65
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:03,893
<i>Yeah, right. Sure. </i>

66
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,131
Anyway, l'll go Plan B on this one.

67
00:05:07,373 --> 00:05:10,069
<i>ProbabIy shouId've started there anyway. </i>

68
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,568
<i>And Tru? </i>

69
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:14,940
l hope it was nice yesterday.

70
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:19,309
- l would've been there if l could, but--
- l know, Harry.

71
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,420
You lost your funding?
But my internship....What happens now?

72
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,051
l'm sorry, Tru. Really.

73
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:31,392
l know. You were counting on this job...

74
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,399
for a little cash and credibility
for med school.

75
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:37,535
There's this other job l heard about.

76
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:40,663
Now don't get excited,
it may not be the exact right fit.

77
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:42,968
You were a track star, right?

78
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:47,336
Well, why don't you run down,
see this guy as soon as you can?

79
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,877
Tell him l sent you.

80
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,109
lt's a good job?

81
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:56,087
Trust me. People would die for it.

82
00:05:59,058 --> 00:06:01,390
You ever been to a morgue before?

83
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:07,625
Just once, when l was 12.

84
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,998
Well, that sounds like a story.

85
00:06:11,804 --> 00:06:14,034
Are you sure
you're interested in working here?

86
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:18,339
Because, l'll be honest, most girls
as pretty as you that come here....

87
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,203
Well, they're dead.

88
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:24,945
l'll be applying to medical school
in the fall...

89
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,077
and my advisor thought
it might be a good idea.

90
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,015
What?

91
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:35,856
Your eyeliner. ls that MAC Number 5?

92
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,155
Seven.

93
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:40,364
Seven. Nice.

94
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,094
The opening is for a forensic
attendant, who retrieves the body...

95
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,997
weighs it, measures it,
attaches the toe tag...

96
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,543
charts the vitals,
and collects the standards.

97
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,944
"Standards"?

98
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:57,811
Head hair, pubic hair, nail clippings.

99
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,248
And then they prepare the body
for storage.

100
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,287
lt's called the crypt.

101
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:07,359
lt's where every unnatural death
in the city comes to rest...

102
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:09,327
waiting for an autopsy.

103
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:12,359
- You said"unnatural death"?
- Most of them.

104
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:16,332
Because if there's even a hint
that a death might be unnatural...

105
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,303
murder, suicide, they come here.

106
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:24,502
- So every crypt....
- Has a body. That's right.

107
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:32,381
Can you imagine the pain
of losing someone before their time?

108
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,420
Bottom line...

109
00:07:36,856 --> 00:07:39,916
most of these people
shouldn't be dead yet.

110
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,953
Go ahead, you can open one.

111
00:07:52,672 --> 00:07:55,232
<i>I need you to start tonight. </i>
<i>The graveyard shift. </i>

112
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,510
- And you're going to take it?
- l just told you l was.

113
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:01,842
l mean, if it looks good to medical schools,
who am l to say no?

114
00:08:01,914 --> 00:08:06,544
Look at me. lf l don't get some sleep soon,
l'm gonna get bags under my bags.

115
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:08,416
You haven't been sleeping again?

116
00:08:08,554 --> 00:08:11,853
Let's not play this game tonight, okay?
l feel good.

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,149
Hey, Tru.

118
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,258
Remember when it didn't take her
death anniversary to get us all together?

119
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,429
l'll see you inside.

120
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,208
Mere, you forgot your...

121
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,113
bag.

122
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:47,052
So, what's Harrison's excuse this time?
A girl? A truckload of DVDs?

123
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:49,520
A girl with a truckload of DVDs?

124
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:53,462
Well, l guess we all
deal with the anniversary differently.

125
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:57,533
- Harrison plays cards.
- You pretend it didn't happen.

126
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,737
And you,
l guess you'd call them old habits.

127
00:09:05,244 --> 00:09:08,179
You went through my bag? Damn it, Tru.

128
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,984
What are you doing?
People like you can't just use once, Mere.

129
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,747
Or didn't they teach you that in rehab?

130
00:09:15,922 --> 00:09:17,617
l'm sorry. Look, l just....

131
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:21,319
You must be doing something right.
You've got a great career, lots of money--

132
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,885
You know,
maybe Harrison had the right idea.

133
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:28,423
- He doesn't even pretend anymore.
- Don't walk out, Mere. Please, we can....

134
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:32,971
Hello.

135
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,542
Harrison? Oh, my God, look at you.

136
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,839
Hospital called and said--
l prayed for a 10 of clubs...

137
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,539
and this is what l get.

138
00:09:41,614 --> 00:09:43,741
A nice reminder
of why l don't believe in God.

139
00:09:43,816 --> 00:09:45,044
Ten of clubs? What happened?

140
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,245
They did this to you?
Those guys you were playing cards with?

141
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,482
l'm coming with you.
No, Tru.

142
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,853
Harrison, look at you.

143
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:54,757
You had your chance, Tru.
You can't help me now.

144
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,089
Clear.

145
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,502
First one?

146
00:10:06,973 --> 00:10:10,340
Congratulations.
But they're all not as pretty as...

147
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:13,006
Rebecca Morgan.

148
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:15,610
What happened to her?

149
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:21,650
You mean, aside from the cap
in the back of her neck? Nothing.

150
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,322
The neighbors heard a gunshot
around 10:00.

151
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,085
<i>We found her in her apartment. </i>

152
00:10:26,158 --> 00:10:28,092
lt's a nice one- bedroom,
if you know anyone.

153
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,061
Do me a favor.
Hold that bag open, will you?

154
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,369
Do you know who did it?

155
00:10:45,044 --> 00:10:46,841
You're new here,
so maybe nobody told you.

156
00:10:46,912 --> 00:10:50,313
We don't solve the crime.
We just deliver the body.

157
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,181
Anyway, have a good night....
Tru.

158
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:01,856
Tru? Catchy.

159
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,185
But wait. You're leaving?

160
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,258
<i>Because Davis said</i>
<i>my first night I wouIdn't be aIone. </i>

161
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:13,499
You won't be.
You'll have 32 friends right next door.

162
00:11:35,594 --> 00:11:37,721
<i>OnIy you can save me. </i>

163
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,634
<i>HeIp. </i>

164
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,240
<i>Tru. </i>

165
00:11:55,981 --> 00:11:57,175
Hello?

166
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:00,944
Marco?

167
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:06,186
<i>HeIp. </i>

168
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,962
Very funny, hazing the new girl.

169
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:17,635
<i>HeIp me. </i>

170
00:12:58,177 --> 00:12:59,940
<i>HeIp me. </i>

171
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,977
<i>Save me. </i>

172
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,643
Help me.

173
00:14:00,306 --> 00:14:01,864
Congratulations.

174
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:04,304
Yesterday, you were an ethics violation...

175
00:14:04,376 --> 00:14:07,709
and today you are a faculty girlfriend.

176
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:11,112
But l meant what l said, Tru.

177
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,981
Now that you graduated, we can go public.

178
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,855
What's wrong?

179
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:28,866
What was l thinking?
l never should have taken that job.

180
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,163
- What job?
- At the morgue.

181
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:34,573
The graveyard shift.
That place creeps me out.

182
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:39,544
The morgue? Sweetie, your internship
starts this morning at the hospital.

183
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:42,079
No, Green's funding was cut.

184
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,547
The job has been eliminated.
l saw him yesterday.

185
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,142
Yesterday was Sunday.
You graduated yesterday.

186
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,916
You had a drink with some friends,
you went to bed with me.

187
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:53,083
Nobody had to go to work
at a morgue.

188
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,457
lt was just a bad dream,
or one too many margaritas.

189
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,055
Yeah, it just seemed--
By the way...

190
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,927
tonight's the faculty banquet, and
l think it's time the Dean knew about you.

191
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,700
Tonight?
Actually l wasn't gonna say a word.

192
00:15:08,807 --> 00:15:12,106
<i>I was just gonna show her</i>
<i>the PoIaroids that I took. </i>

193
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,776
<i>HeIIo, and weIcome to</i>
<i>another</i> Monday Morning Money.

194
00:15:16,882 --> 00:15:19,612
Hello?
<i>Tru, it's your favorite brother. </i>

195
00:15:19,952 --> 00:15:22,079
l'm in a bit of a situation.

196
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:26,317
We were through this yesterday, Harrison.
l don't have that kind of money.

197
00:15:26,392 --> 00:15:28,189
What are you talking about?

198
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,252
Look, are you mad
because l didn't go to your graduation?

199
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:33,321
<i>And your second number...</i>

200
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,560
Four.
<i>Are you Iistening? </i>

201
00:15:35,668 --> 00:15:36,828
<i>...is four. </i>

202
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:38,803
<i>Tru? </i>

203
00:15:39,638 --> 00:15:43,074
Listen, Harrison,
maybe you shouldn't go back to that table.

204
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:45,440
Maybe you should walk away now.

205
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,241
Yeah. See you, Tru.

206
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,350
<i>Your third number...</i>
Twenty- nine.

207
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,943
<i>...is 29. </i>

208
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:04,724
<i>You never met me? </i>

209
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:07,128
l have never met you.

210
00:16:07,566 --> 00:16:11,195
Then again, l haven't been
going to the gym lately so....

211
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:15,300
MAC Number 7.

212
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,471
The crypt. This way, right?

213
00:16:22,781 --> 00:16:25,375
You sure you haven't worked
in a morgue before?

214
00:16:25,451 --> 00:16:28,443
So this is the crypt. This is where every....

215
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,218
<i>Is there something I can heIp you with? </i>

216
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,748
Last night,
a woman named Rebecca Morgan died.

217
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,625
She was brought here.
A friend of yours?

218
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:42,430
Who was on duty last night?
Marco, l think.

219
00:16:43,369 --> 00:16:45,098
<i>No, she never came in. </i>

220
00:16:45,204 --> 00:16:47,764
You said....l mean, someone said...

221
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:51,065
that the bodies brought here,
they're unnatural deaths.

222
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,666
Some of them, yes.

223
00:16:52,778 --> 00:16:55,542
So those people
shouldn't actually be dead.

224
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,473
Not yet, anyway.

225
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,517
ls it hard to see people dead
before their time? Yes.

226
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,511
<i>But if you're gonna work here...</i>

227
00:17:03,589 --> 00:17:07,787
you've got to accept the fact
that there's nothing you can do about it.

228
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,890
<i>That was a job offer, </i>
<i>in case you missed it. </i>

229
00:17:12,831 --> 00:17:13,991
What happened to her?

230
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:16,261
The neighbors heard a gunshot at 10:00.

231
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:18,462
The truth is we're shorthanded...

232
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,970
and you seem
to already know the operation.

233
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,667
l'll take it.
Great.

234
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,834
l'll need you tonight.

235
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:27,940
Tru?

236
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:35,119
303 West 23rd Street.

237
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,552
<i>Who is she? </i>
l don't know yet. Hopefully, no one.

238
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:40,649
<i>Each time I hope</i>
<i>someone is no one...</i>

239
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,787
they always turn out to be someone.
Maybe you'll have better luck.

240
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,162
So anyways, are you really serious
about this job at the morgue?

241
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,428
Because l got to be honest...

242
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,494
l think it's really gonna cut into
our post- college slacking off.

243
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,368
<i>Lindsay, I'II caII you back. </i>

244
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:56,441
Oh, Tru.

245
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:58,143
Tru?

246
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,999
She's alive.

247
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,867
For another 10 hours.

248
00:18:49,928 --> 00:18:51,225
<i>HeIIo? </i>

249
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,456
Coffee, please.

250
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,436
You okay?
Yeah.

251
00:18:59,037 --> 00:19:01,130
l'm just having a strange day.

252
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,175
Maybe you'd like something
a little stronger than coffee, then.

253
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:05,710
Coffee's fine.

254
00:19:08,013 --> 00:19:10,345
The truth is l shouldn't complain.

255
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,906
l have this friend
who's about to have a worse day...

256
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,385
and she doesn't even know it yet.

257
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:20,988
- This is gonna sound crazy, but--
- Hold on.

258
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,093
Hello? What are you....

259
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:27,525
Aaron, we've been through all this.
No, l can't do this right now.

260
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:29,123
<i>Goodbye, Aaron. </i>

261
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,502
Some people just don't know
when it's over.

262
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:35,664
Rebecca, l'm gonna tell you something.

263
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:37,674
How do you know my name?
We know each other?

264
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:40,109
That friend about to have the bad day--

265
00:19:40,579 --> 00:19:41,546
Hey.

266
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:44,415
You know what, never mind. My bad.

267
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:50,785
<i>HeIp me. </i>

268
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,482
l don't know how to say this,
so l'm just gonna say it.

269
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,460
- You're gonna die today, Rebecca.
- What did you just say?

270
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:02,728
You have to trust me.
Maybe we can stop it. We have nine hours.

271
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:06,828
- You asked for my help. Now l need yours.
- l asked for your help? You're crazy.

272
00:20:06,939 --> 00:20:09,066
Just tell me
why someone would want to hurt you.

273
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,404
Gary?
Why would they want....

274
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:14,308
Can you come here?
What's up?

275
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,404
There's this girl
saying strange things.

276
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,282
What girl?
The one right at the bar.

277
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,252
Come outside.
What did she say?

278
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,717
She said l was gonna die today.
What? Where?

279
00:20:34,433 --> 00:20:36,162
lt would've been perfect with Rebecca...

280
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,727
if only l could've convinced her
to fall in love with me.

281
00:20:39,871 --> 00:20:43,307
lt's funny. Tru, right?
She never mentioned you before.

282
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:46,035
Well, l just started there. Weekends.

283
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:48,441
Gary thought we needed some extra help.

284
00:20:48,513 --> 00:20:50,708
What kind of trouble do you think she's in?

285
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,148
lt's hard to say. l know it's a long shot...

286
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:55,550
but do you know anyone
who would want to hurt her?

287
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:58,886
No, although she didn't need any help
in that department.

288
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:01,221
She beat herself up
over the smallest things.

289
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,351
Bad day, blow an audition.

290
00:21:03,962 --> 00:21:07,796
- Actors, sure.
- Dance. She's a dancer.

291
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:12,300
Well, thanks.

292
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,305
Like l said,
she'd kill me if she knew l was here so....

293
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:18,866
lt's funny. A girl's in trouble,
and everybody suspects the ex- boyfriend.

294
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,604
Aaron, no, that's not what--

295
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,842
No, l'm saying lucky for me
l'm not the only one.

296
00:21:26,652 --> 00:21:28,677
His name's Elliot Winters.

297
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:52,104
Do you have a résumé for me,
or should l just call security?

298
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:56,370
Actually, l'm not here for an interview.
l'm here about Rebecca.

299
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,051
- Rebecca?
- Rebecca Morgan.

300
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,613
l'm not passing judgment. Obviously--

301
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,680
My daughter's dance teacher.
Why would you....

302
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,983
Okay, l don't understand.

303
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,861
So you two weren't....

304
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:17,366
Was she interested? Sure.
Was l flattered? Absolutely.

305
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:19,927
But those pictures over there
aren't for show.

306
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:21,972
That's my life.

307
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,336
l don't know what she told you...

308
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:29,380
but sometimes being a good friend
means not listening so closely.

309
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:31,540
<i>Anyway, Iots to do. </i>

310
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:35,280
<i>So why are you so worried</i>
<i>about Rebecca? </i>

311
00:22:35,721 --> 00:22:37,951
Because she's gonna die today.

312
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:44,553
Don't worry about calling security.
l'll show myself out.

313
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,131
Are you sure you're okay?

314
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:53,330
My God, that actually sounds
like genuine concern.

315
00:22:53,438 --> 00:22:56,601
Wait a second. Who is this,
and what have you done with my sister?

316
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,438
lt's just, l know how stressed you get.
Especially today.

317
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,605
<i>I can't taIk right now, Tru. </i>
<i>I'II see you tonight, okay? </i>

318
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,775
And call me crazy, but l actually think
Harrison's gonna make it this year.

319
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:12,251
You tell your friend Rebecca
that if this is a threat...

320
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,791
it's not gonna work.

321
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:17,795
We've been down this road before,
she and l. We're over. Done.

322
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:22,730
lf she insists on going to my wife,
l'll do everything in my power to stop her.

323
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:24,132
Everything.

324
00:23:38,116 --> 00:23:39,583
l'll see you.

325
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,026
Can't win them all, right?
Where's the fun of that?

326
00:23:56,668 --> 00:23:58,397
Guys, relax.

327
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,193
She's my sister.

328
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,444
<i>Leave now. </i>

329
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,080
l'm telling you,
cash in and walk away now.

330
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,174
Are you kidding me?

331
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:15,515
You saw the stack of chips l had in there.
l'm up!

332
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,215
Now, Harry.
You're up now, but it's not gonna last.

333
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,848
l thought you said you were short.

334
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,859
- l took a marker from the house.
- What?

335
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,053
A loan.

336
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,596
Great, so you're playing
with house money.

337
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,534
Are you okay?

338
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,497
ls everything okay?
l'm having a day, Harrison.

339
00:24:34,606 --> 00:24:36,699
A day l'd gladly explain to you if l could...

340
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,436
but l can't, so l'm not even gonna try it.

341
00:24:41,213 --> 00:24:43,238
And l heard another voice.

342
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,642
Wait.

343
00:24:47,252 --> 00:24:50,415
l don't understand. You mean, like Mom?

344
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:51,580
<i>Okay, Mommy. </i>

345
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,920
No, not her. Someone else.

346
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,520
Dead?

347
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,198
- Oh, boy.
- And that's not even the half of it.

348
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,632
Believe it or not,
that's the half that makes sense.

349
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:07,433
l don't get it. Me, of all people,
why do they come to me?

350
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:10,372
Maybe because they know
that you'll listen.

351
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:15,678
Do you think l'm crazy?

352
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:18,679
l never thought you were crazy.

353
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:22,720
l gotta get back, okay?

354
00:25:22,787 --> 00:25:26,587
Just do me a favor. Slow down the betting
to give me more time.

355
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:30,825
- For what?
- For figuring out a way to save your ass.

356
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,695
<i>Gary, I reaIIy need to taIk to her. </i>

357
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:41,464
l told you, she wasn't feeling well.
Needed some air.

358
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,768
<i>It seems to be happening a Iot IateIy. </i>

359
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,536
<i>One- one deIivery. </i>

360
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,977
What's the score?
Seven- one, Sox. Top of the ninth.

361
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,679
l'll bet you $100 they lose.

362
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,420
- What, are you crazy?
- Maybe. Don't know yet.

363
00:25:57,756 --> 00:26:01,487
Sorry, Gary. l lost track of time.
This girl says she knows you.

364
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,956
Stay away from me. Don't come near me.

365
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,794
l know you don't understand.
Me, neither, but l wanna help--

366
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:11,165
You want to help?
Why don't you start by leaving me alone?

367
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:14,795
You know what,
maybe you'd better listen to her.

368
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:18,808
Gary, she's in trouble.
And she has no idea how much.

369
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:21,245
Why should l believe you?

370
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,647
All right. Here's the thing.

371
00:26:24,716 --> 00:26:28,880
lf the Sox win, l'm good for the $100.
But if they lose, you help me.

372
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,153
Got a letter for Meredith Davies.

373
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,626
Tru, this is a surprise.

374
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,673
Guess l thought it was about time
l saw your office.

375
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,903
l see. Trying to make me feel guilty
about missing your graduation?

376
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:54,911
- l'm sorry, Tru--
- God, what happened to us?

377
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,340
We used to be close, all of us.

378
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,683
Now l find myself doing more for strangers
than l do for my own family.

379
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,914
What are you talking about?

380
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:08,323
Any second, someone's gonna
hand you an envelope.

381
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:11,953
An envelope with coke inside.
Just don't touch it, Mere.

382
00:27:13,698 --> 00:27:16,394
Tru, your newfound concern is touching.

383
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,663
lt's psychotic, but touching.

384
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,101
Because no one is bringing me coke.

385
00:27:21,206 --> 00:27:25,700
Much less an envelope full of it
to my office. Really, Tru, trust me.

386
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:30,571
Boy, you have some imagination,
you know that?

387
00:27:30,849 --> 00:27:34,148
You know, l'm not sure
where you get all your facts but....

388
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,854
ls this how you get your kicks?

389
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:45,429
By convincing yourself you're not
the most screwed- up one in the family?

390
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,359
You can't fix people, Tru.

391
00:27:47,432 --> 00:27:50,560
You can't save them.
Not Mom 10 years ago, not me.

392
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:53,195
And at this rate,
probably not even yourself.

393
00:27:56,941 --> 00:28:00,604
- Why do l think you're lying to me?
- l shouldn't have looked through the files.

394
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:03,978
l just have a few questions.
What about? Unsolved murders?

395
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,779
Exactly.
<i>So Iet me get this straight. </i>

396
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,012
ln the eight hours
since you've been here...

397
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,816
you've decided to solve old cases?

398
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:12,413
<i>Very ambitious. </i>

399
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:15,589
You know what l did today?
l bought socks.

400
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,889
l'm just curious.

401
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:21,295
What can you say about a woman
who comes in with a bullet in her neck?

402
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,334
- That she's dead?
- Davis.

403
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:28,127
Okay, fine. Bullet in the neck.

404
00:28:29,574 --> 00:28:32,168
l'm guessing
her death was execution style.

405
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:35,405
Meaning she did something to someone
to make them angry.

406
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:39,677
Small caliber bullet. Probably a. 22.

407
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:41,209
How so?

408
00:28:41,286 --> 00:28:43,379
From what you said,
there was no exit wound.

409
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:45,946
The bullet just lodged itself in her neck.

410
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:47,514
<i>And I'II be honest with you. </i>

411
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:50,322
<i>You don't have to go through this troubIe</i>
<i>to impress me. </i>

412
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:52,920
<i>AII I need is for someone</i>
<i>to show up to work on time. </i>

413
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:54,931
Davis, thanks. l gotta run.

414
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,396
A pretty girl's nothing but trouble.

415
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,240
Beaten up. What?

416
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:13,975
- How could you possibly know that?
- Just trust me, okay?

417
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,243
And take this.

418
00:29:17,522 --> 00:29:22,118
Think of it as an answer to a prayer.
There are 52 cards in a deck.

419
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,429
The chances of this saving me
from a beating....

420
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:28,895
Have a little faith in your sister, okay?

421
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,630
Remember when l said you weren't crazy?

422
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:35,705
l may have to rethink my position,
you know.

423
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,540
How the hell did you know
the Sox were gonna blow it?

424
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,605
Where is she, Gary?
<i>She went to see Winters. </i>

425
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,424
Charles, hello.

426
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:12,977
Mrs. Winters: lt's wonderful.

427
00:30:15,713 --> 00:30:17,943
<i>I'm so proud of you. </i>

428
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:24,177
Want to know what's worse than watching
academics congratulate themselves?

429
00:30:24,255 --> 00:30:25,882
lt's watching them eat.

430
00:30:26,591 --> 00:30:29,992
Are you feeling any better?
This morning you seemed a little--

431
00:30:30,061 --> 00:30:33,292
l can't even begin to describe to you
what this day's been like.

432
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,959
- Don't worry. lt'll be over soon enough.
- Yeah, let's hope so.

433
00:30:38,736 --> 00:30:40,363
Mark, l gotta go.

434
00:31:10,902 --> 00:31:13,769
Don't do it. He'll kill you.

435
00:31:22,513 --> 00:31:24,947
l still don't understand
how could you possibly know...

436
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:26,984
that Elliot would kill me?

437
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,918
Let's just say
l've seen what he's capable of.

438
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:33,219
lt's amazing how charming a man can be
when he wants to get in...

439
00:31:33,291 --> 00:31:36,317
and how callous he can be
when he wants to get out.

440
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:39,557
God, l thought going there
would change his mind.

441
00:31:39,697 --> 00:31:40,823
Rebecca.

442
00:31:42,367 --> 00:31:45,427
- Aaron, what are you doing here?
- l was worried about you.

443
00:31:45,503 --> 00:31:47,528
l thought you said
you couldn't find that key?

444
00:31:47,605 --> 00:31:50,870
She came to see me,
said you might be in some sort of trouble.

445
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:54,274
l'm fine, Aaron.
Everything's fine. You can go now.

446
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,041
l don't want to leave.
l want to work things out.

447
00:31:57,115 --> 00:31:59,948
You don't have to be alone,
especially now.

448
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:03,452
l'm not gonna start this again
with you. l want you to go.

449
00:32:03,488 --> 00:32:06,753
Rebecca, l came here to help you.
No, you didn't.

450
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,784
He came here to kill you.

451
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,039
What are you talking about? This is crazy.

452
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,633
Right. About as crazy
as the. 22 caliber in your pocket.

453
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:28,943
- What, this?
- Oh, my God.

454
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:33,177
This is for you to protect yourself.
Don't be so blind, Rebecca. You need this.

455
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,549
You know what he's capable of. Elliot.

456
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,611
Why don't you give me the gun, Aaron?

457
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:40,522
And by the way,
who the hell are you really?

458
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:43,458
You think you're doing her a favor,
messing with her life?

459
00:32:43,528 --> 00:32:46,725
lf you ask me,
l think it's a really good way to get hurt.

460
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,595
One.

461
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:07,208
Elliot would never hurt me. lt's you, Aaron.

462
00:33:07,285 --> 00:33:09,116
What are you talking about? What is me?

463
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:11,747
Why are you defending him?
You're always defending him...

464
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,620
- even after what he did to you!
- Did to me?

465
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:16,489
- He didn't do anything to me. l'm just--
- Pregnant.

466
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:20,156
You're pregnant.
Folic acid prescribed for pregnancy.

467
00:33:21,132 --> 00:33:23,862
Aaron, listen to me.
You don't even know it...

468
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:26,904
but you're getting a second chance
to not kill two people...

469
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,939
so just give me the gun.

470
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:40,583
Becky, l never wanted to hurt you.
l just wanted to help, you know that.

471
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,111
You need to go, Aaron. Now.

472
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,824
No, just leave him.

473
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,725
Lock the door.

474
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:57,598
Stay inside and call the police.
He has to go home some time.

475
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,164
What?

476
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,332
l just realized.

477
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:07,343
l never said"thank you."

478
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,531
Mr. Chiang wants to remind you...

479
00:34:31,602 --> 00:34:35,038
all debts must be settled immediately
following the last hand.

480
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,102
Yeah, l got the memo.

481
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:51,818
A pleasure, fellows.

482
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,322
<i>How did you know? </i>

483
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:56,654
l mean, the 10 of clubs. Right there.

484
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:59,127
Seriously, how did you know?

485
00:34:59,197 --> 00:35:02,758
Let's just say
l've been a step ahead of everyone all day.

486
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:04,726
Of course, l didn't make a dime.

487
00:35:04,802 --> 00:35:08,260
Every penny l won went back
to the Tram to pay off the marker.

488
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,032
There's a story here, right?

489
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:14,077
Yeah, there's a story.

490
00:35:15,713 --> 00:35:17,806
l almost didn't recognize you guys.

491
00:35:17,915 --> 00:35:21,646
l said,"That can't be my family.
Too much damn happiness."

492
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:25,921
- lt was good to see you today, Tru.
- Was it?

493
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,626
Yeah, it was.

494
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,324
See, l told you
Harrison was gonna show this year.

495
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:36,729
l'll be right back. Order me a club soda.

496
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:42,531
You and Meredith, getting along?

497
00:35:43,908 --> 00:35:47,275
Just when l thought
things couldn't get any stranger....

498
00:36:04,028 --> 00:36:06,826
Do you ever think
Mom's still watching us?

499
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,764
God, l hope not...

500
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:16,906
because l'm not sure
she'd like what she sees.

501
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,476
Yeah.

502
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:22,344
Maybe she's trying to change that.

503
00:36:29,153 --> 00:36:31,587
That's a nice outfit, by the way.
Hello?

504
00:36:31,822 --> 00:36:34,290
Hi, is this a bad time?
Because l can call back.

505
00:36:34,358 --> 00:36:35,586
No, it's fine.

506
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,957
<i>Is everything okay, Davis? </i>

507
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:41,328
Yeah, l was thinking about that girl,
you know, the dead one?

508
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,535
And l thought of another reason
there might not be an exit wound.

509
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,504
What's that?
Order what you want. l'll split it with you.

510
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:51,440
You know the entry wound in her neck?

511
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,478
Maybe that wasn't an entry wound.
Maybe that was an exit wound.

512
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:59,005
That would mean
the bullet went through--

513
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,777
Her mouth. Yes, exactly.

514
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,254
<i>Which, if you ask me, sounds seIf- infIicted. </i>

515
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:07,515
- Meaning it wasn't a homicide.
- lt was suicide.

516
00:38:01,012 --> 00:38:03,947
The thing is
l always wanted to be a mother.

517
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:09,586
A house, the kids, all of it.

518
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:15,047
My only mistake was believing
that he wanted it, too.

519
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:20,052
Rebecca.

520
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,999
Maybe he did.

521
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,595
Just not with his mistress.

522
00:38:28,439 --> 00:38:31,237
Because when l told him about the baby...

523
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,973
he made it clear that's all l ever was.

524
00:38:43,087 --> 00:38:45,487
But it's not all you're gonna be.

525
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,556
You're gonna be a mom, Rebecca.

526
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,890
Take it from someone
who lost hers way too soon.

527
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,224
You're supposed to live.

528
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,696
<i>There's no better reason to. </i>

529
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:05,874
Your mother?

530
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,144
Was killed...

531
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,974
ten years ago, in front of me...

532
00:39:14,985 --> 00:39:17,044
by a man they never found.

533
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,094
lt wasn't her time then...

534
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,230
and it's not yours now.

535
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,970
Rebecca, will you give me the gun?

536
00:40:25,055 --> 00:40:27,819
Hey, you new here?
Sort of. Do you mind?

537
00:40:28,192 --> 00:40:31,025
An eager one.
Go ahead. Knock yourself out.

538
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:35,830
We found her in her apartment.
You should've seen this place.

539
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,892
lt was a nice one- bedroom,
if you know anyone.

540
00:40:40,137 --> 00:40:42,367
<i>Cancer. It's a bitch. </i>

541
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,999
So, first one?

542
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:48,978
No. Second.

543
00:40:56,654 --> 00:41:00,556
<i>It's sunny and miId on</i>
<i>this beautifuI Tuesday morning, May 27. </i>

544
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,354
<i>Traffic copter reports</i>
<i>no major deIays en route. </i>

545
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:07,022
<i>It's been the strangest day. </i>

546
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,957
<i>An understatement, I know. </i>

547
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,094
<i>Did you have anything to do with it? </i>

548
00:41:17,274 --> 00:41:18,571
<i>I don't know. </i>

549
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:22,112
<i>I onIy know I wish this day had come</i>
<i>10 years earIier. </i>

550
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:28,143
<i>Then maybe I couId've saved you, too. </i>

551
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:32,418
<i>Instead I'II wait...</i>

552
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:35,389
<i>for others. </i>

553
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,593
<i>Some who have needed me</i>
<i>Ionger than most. </i>

554
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,930
<i>So maybe I couIdn't save you. </i>

555
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:53,170
<i>Maybe, just maybe...</i>

556
00:41:54,879 --> 00:41:57,109
<i>this is your way of saving me. </i>
