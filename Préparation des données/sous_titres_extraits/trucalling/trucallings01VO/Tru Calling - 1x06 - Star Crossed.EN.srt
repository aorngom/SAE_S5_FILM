1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:06,161
You can't keep avoiding me.

2
00:00:06,272 --> 00:00:08,069
Really? I thought I was doing a good job.

3
00:00:08,141 --> 00:00:09,631
I know what you can do.

4
00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,040
I heard you the first time.

5
00:00:11,111 --> 00:00:12,840
That doesn't make it any funnier.

6
00:00:12,912 --> 00:00:15,676
It's not a coincidence
that there've been fewer deaths...

7
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,842
since you started working here.

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:22,148
I have no idea what you're talking about.

9
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,952
Tru, I've watched you.
I've seen how you behave.

10
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:27,950
<i>You can do things. </i>

11
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,155
Things that others can't.

12
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:37,101
I don't even know how to....

13
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,002
Tru, it's okay.

14
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,135
You can talk to me.

15
00:00:50,917 --> 00:00:53,818
They ask me to help them.

16
00:00:57,657 --> 00:01:00,922
I wake up, the same day starts over and--

17
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,018
You save them.

18
00:01:04,664 --> 00:01:07,565
Try to. Sometimes I can't.

19
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,398
You don't think I'm crazy?
No, do you?

20
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:15,673
Sometimes.

21
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,167
You're not.

22
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:23,307
Why isn't this just
completely freaking you out?

23
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,352
I've seen a lot of strange things here.
Very little shocks me.

24
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:30,017
I can't. I can't live like this.

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,354
I keep secrets from people that I love.

26
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:35,360
I can't have a normal relationship.
You're saving lives.

27
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,588
It's a gift.

28
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:38,494
No, candles are gifts.

29
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,863
Boots, bath salts maybe, but this is....

30
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,402
I don't know what this is. Do you?

31
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:49,434
I don't. Not yet. But tell me, Tru.

32
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,171
How does it feel...

33
00:01:52,245 --> 00:01:54,679
to know that somewhere out there...

34
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:57,413
someone is about to die...

35
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:01,347
and they're gonna ask you for your help?

36
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:12,355
Hello?

37
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:15,028
Yeah, I'm ready.

38
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,660
I know we have to do this.

39
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:20,931
I love you, too.

40
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:37,514
Help me.

41
00:02:53,806 --> 00:02:55,933
<i>No, reaIIy, </i>
<i>who do you think I am? </i>

42
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,669
<i>Baby, I think you're my girI. </i>

43
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,211
<i>Anything wrong with that? </i>

44
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,543
<i>You shouIdn't be so certain. </i>

45
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:03,844
<i>Can't heIp it if I'm certain. </i>

46
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:07,076
<i>Come on, Iet's take a waIk, huh? </i>

47
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:08,643
<i>No, I'm not faIIing for that. </i>

48
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:11,053
<i>You're faIIing for somebody. </i>

49
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,859
Tru, love is never like it is in the movies.

50
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:28,269
<i>I mean, when was the Iast time you kissed</i>
<i>and music sweIIed? </i>

51
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,901
You're lucky if you can find
a guy that can tell time.

52
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,468
I'm not asking for much, Linds.

53
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,709
Just a solid guy,
some decent conversation.

54
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:40,947
Maybe when he smiles,
he'll have this little crease above his lip.

55
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,783
Oh, God, who is he?

56
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:45,989
His name is Luc.

57
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,584
And he's a crime scene photographer.

58
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,897
But what's the point?

59
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:54,399
With the hours I keep,
we'll never have time together.

60
00:03:54,467 --> 00:03:56,435
That'll lead to issues and....

61
00:03:56,502 --> 00:03:58,129
You're planning the breakup...

62
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,172
and you haven't even
gone out with the guy yet.

63
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:04,300
Look, I'm just saying,
know what you want, and act accordingly.

64
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,112
For example, what I want
is out of my cube at the office.

65
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:10,046
So tonight, over drinks...

66
00:04:10,116 --> 00:04:13,847
I am gonna show the big boss man
my take on a new account.

67
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,912
I don't want a promotion.
I just want a first date.

68
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:18,951
Fine.

69
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:22,483
<i>But if it's romantic settings...</i>

70
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,860
and movie moments that you're after...

71
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,332
my advice, keep them a mystery.

72
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,801
Because real life is not like the movies.

73
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,196
Sorry.

74
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:41,874
Okay, I really hope you like my take on this.

75
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:44,176
Let's take a look.

76
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,913
You've put a lot of work into this, Lindsay.

77
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,548
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

78
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,151
It's exactly this kind of motivation
that moves you forward.

79
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,992
Knowing what you want, and going for it.

80
00:04:58,064 --> 00:04:59,395
That is so funny.

81
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,161
I just said that exact thing
to my friend today.

82
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,969
I just got back from a pickup...

83
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:13,069
so just make sure there's nothing
left in the truck, okay?

84
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,444
- No problem.
- Good.

85
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:22,988
Hey.

86
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,354
Hey. What are you doing here?

87
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:28,155
One: I work here.

88
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,755
Right. And two?

89
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,689
Look, um...

90
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,334
I was thinking how we've been
seeing a lot of each other...

91
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,904
here in the morgue.

92
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:43,203
I was thinking how maybe it'd be nice
to see each other outside of the morgue.

93
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:47,977
<i>I know this isn't</i>
<i>the most appropriate pIace to ask...</i>

94
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,181
but would you be interested
in going out sometime?

95
00:05:51,984 --> 00:05:54,817
I know this isn't
the most appropriate place to say yes...

96
00:05:54,887 --> 00:05:57,583
but, yeah, I'd really like that.

97
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,387
How's tomorrow?

98
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,826
Tomorrow might be risky.

99
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,029
I never really know
how my days are gonna go.

100
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,195
Look, you got an hour.

101
00:06:09,302 --> 00:06:10,997
Okay, so take it.

102
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,540
<i>I got it covered. Don't worry about it. </i>

103
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:17,508
You guys have been doing
the mating dance for weeks now.

104
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:19,044
Get it over with.

105
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:20,668
You got an hour?

106
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,873
Yeah.

107
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,306
Thanks.

108
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:29,076
So....

109
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,451
You grew up wanting
to take pictures of dead people?

110
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,018
I grew up wanting to take pictures.

111
00:06:37,096 --> 00:06:39,428
The dead people...

112
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,823
came later.

113
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:44,661
- I know the feeling.
- What'd you say?

114
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,631
- I said, I know the feeling.
- What?

115
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,709
I said, I....

116
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:53,709
Never mind.

117
00:06:56,115 --> 00:07:00,415
How's it possible that you're still single?

118
00:07:01,854 --> 00:07:04,186
My friend Lindsay always says:

119
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,090
"If the wrong guy's in the room,
I'll find him."

120
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,329
I mean, not now. I mean, not you.

121
00:07:11,397 --> 00:07:12,887
I didn't mean....

122
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,761
Just a minute.

123
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:17,469
Sorry.

124
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,935
That's all right.

125
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,830
What's up?

126
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,464
Total disaster.

127
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:24,042
Tell me about it.

128
00:07:24,143 --> 00:07:27,408
Okay, I will.
I just got busted down to receptionist.

129
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,341
You're kidding. What for?

130
00:07:29,415 --> 00:07:31,576
<i>My boss made a move, </i>
<i>I said no...</i>

131
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:34,518
and he said,
"Maybe you'd enjoy answering phones."

132
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:37,488
Okay, don't worry, we'll fix this.
I'll call you later, okay?

133
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,187
Okay. Bye.

134
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:43,922
You okay?

135
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,360
Are we having fun yet?

136
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,900
Yeah.

137
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,533
- Oh, my God.
- No, I got it.

138
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:55,898
Yeah?

139
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,203
Yeah, you've got a pickup on- site.

140
00:07:58,277 --> 00:08:00,336
It's two bodies and Gardez needs help.

141
00:08:00,413 --> 00:08:01,437
No, a pickup?

142
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,846
I didn't know that was part
of the job description.

143
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,974
Great.

144
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,075
Surprise.

145
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,346
This was going so well.

146
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,049
Sorry.

147
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,527
So, how'd it go with photo boy?

148
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:19,053
You know those nights where things
click and you never want it to end?

149
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:20,428
That bad, huh?

150
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,765
I'm surprised we didn't get called out
to Lakewood Cliff sooner.

151
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:26,737
Looks like the guardrail finally gave way.

152
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,233
Hey, you got any advice
for a first- timer?

153
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,709
Thanks. Yeah, don't think so much.

154
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:35,506
Any theories?

155
00:08:35,581 --> 00:08:37,139
Young love.

156
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:38,911
<i>How many times have you seen a death...</i>

157
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,954
that doesn't have
something to do with love?

158
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:44,882
<i>You see that neckIace there? </i>

159
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:48,017
<i>Not something a high- schooI girI</i>
<i>wouId buy for herseIf. </i>

160
00:08:48,794 --> 00:08:50,819
It probably came from him.

161
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:54,592
Do we know who they are?

162
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,465
The guy's name's Adam Whitman,
a student at Highland Prep.

163
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,733
<i>The girI's name's Jen DeLuca, </i>
<i>just a Iearner's permit. </i>

164
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,178
<i>See that tattoo? It means"ambition."</i>

165
00:09:07,246 --> 00:09:09,771
Looks like his was cut a little short though.

166
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,074
Damn, the bodies
are all jacked up.

167
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,245
<i>We need a coupIe of stokes. </i>

168
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,450
I'll be right back.

169
00:09:22,161 --> 00:09:24,356
You were in love, weren't you?

170
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:30,665
Help us.

171
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:55,026
So you're saying yesterday a guy and a girl
went over a cliff in a car accident?

172
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,322
Yeah.

173
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,924
Was I wearing this shirt?

174
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:00,989
Unfortunately, yes.

175
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,628
License plate was....

176
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:09,138
689- TYH.

177
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:11,776
You memorized the license plate?

178
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:13,471
I memorize everything I can.

179
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:17,175
Once they ask for help,
I lose the body, any evidence.

180
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,877
The only thing I can go on
is what I remember.

181
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,885
<i>Okay, the car was Adam's, </i>
<i>so I'II find him first. </i>

182
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,417
I guess I'm going to Highland Prep.

183
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,357
Slow down there.

184
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:33,693
Yeah, I'm kinda in a rush.

185
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,563
That's funny, I was just thinking...

186
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:39,069
how we've been seeing a lot of each other
here in the morgue.

187
00:10:40,072 --> 00:10:41,437
Yeah. Funny.

188
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:42,701
Then I was thinking...

189
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:46,302
how maybe it'd be nice to see each other
outside of the morgue.

190
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,775
I'm right in the middle of something.

191
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:51,714
Come on. It'll be fun.

192
00:10:54,286 --> 00:10:55,548
No, I got it.

193
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:56,980
Yeah?

194
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,789
It could be.

195
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,127
I would love to. I would.

196
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:05,424
I just....Not right now.

197
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:07,466
<i>I can't right now. </i>

198
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,398
Let me just get back to you, okay?

199
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,901
- Yeah.
- Okay.

200
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:17,436
Keys?

201
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,941
You be careful with her.

202
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,306
I know. You won her in
the best poker game of your life.

203
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:27,079
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

204
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:30,652
Hold up. Is this one of your crazy days?

205
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:33,720
Keys? Yes, or no?

206
00:11:34,894 --> 00:11:37,920
I just want her back, that's all.
Without a scratch.

207
00:11:38,798 --> 00:11:41,232
Not the car. My sister.

208
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,198
Yeah?

209
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:49,838
Where are you?

210
00:11:49,909 --> 00:11:52,844
Oh, God, Linds, I'm sorry.
I had to bolt. Something came up at work.

211
00:11:52,912 --> 00:11:55,403
lncoming call
from Planet Bitch. Come back now.

212
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,880
Harrison says,"Hi."

213
00:11:56,949 --> 00:11:59,816
Is it visitation day at the penitentiary?

214
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,716
She sends big hugs.

215
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:03,721
Can we hook up later?

216
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:06,589
Can't. I have to meet up
with my boss for drinks.

217
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:08,923
<i>I'm showing him</i>
<i>my take on a new account. </i>

218
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,292
<i>I just got busted</i>
<i>down to receptionist! </i>

219
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,389
You know, Linds, I really think
you should cancel.

220
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,163
<i>You know, </i>
<i>maybe keep work meetings in the office. </i>

221
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,238
Thanks. But I really think
he's gonna be impressed. Trust me.

222
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,603
<i>I'II caII you after? Bye. </i>

223
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,073
Harrison.

224
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,114
I'm gonna need one more favor.

225
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,660
So I'm a mature 17.

226
00:13:11,323 --> 00:13:12,312
Excuse me.

227
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:14,882
Do you know
where I can find Adam Whitman?

228
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,326
Thanks.

229
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:23,892
I don't get you.

230
00:13:24,003 --> 00:13:26,631
You're dating the hottest girl in school,
and you're sad.

231
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,604
I don't love her'cause she's hot, Cole.

232
00:13:28,674 --> 00:13:29,663
Come on.

233
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:30,901
You know what? You don't....

234
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,443
Just forget it.
What?

235
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:35,742
You don't think I understand
the plight of star- crossed lovers?

236
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:38,648
I got a C- plus on that paper.

237
00:13:39,618 --> 00:13:41,449
- Ambition.
- Good luck.

238
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,954
Nice ink.

239
00:13:46,058 --> 00:13:47,650
Hardly any bleed- off.

240
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:49,619
Good work, too.

241
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,355
- Adam.
- Tru.

242
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:56,057
lmpressive.

243
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,293
What's your deal? You new?

244
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,640
Checking it out for the day.
My family's thinking of moving here.

245
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,173
Run, don't walk.

246
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:05,938
We're all stuck here,
but you still got an out.

247
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:07,342
That bad?

248
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,574
Not if you find the right person.

249
00:14:10,149 --> 00:14:12,117
This is my girlfriend Amy.

250
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,249
Your girlfriend?

251
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,211
Young love.

252
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:20,017
This is Tru.

253
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:22,053
Prospective student.

254
00:14:22,127 --> 00:14:23,924
Amy. Nice to meet you.

255
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,595
We hitting the café or what?

256
00:14:25,664 --> 00:14:26,722
Yeah. Whatever you want.

257
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:30,257
I couldn't give the okay to a school
without checking out the grub first.

258
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,270
A girl after my own heart. Tag if you want.

259
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:37,871
Cool.

260
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:41,037
So where you from, anyway?

261
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:43,245
Does it matter?

262
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:45,442
Not to me, but to some.

263
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,482
Most of us pay to go here.

264
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,045
Some of the other kids,
they're here on scholarship...

265
00:14:51,123 --> 00:14:53,717
so they actually have to
work their way through.

266
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:55,191
What's the big deal?

267
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:59,527
It's stupid, really.
It's like this decades- old thing.

268
00:14:59,698 --> 00:15:01,188
The two sides of the town just don't mix.

269
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,927
So it seeps into the school.

270
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:05,835
We avoid them, they avoid us.

271
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,140
Boy, it's fun to grow up
in the middle of a cliché.

272
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,071
Let me get this for you.

273
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,341
First meal's on me.
I'm just gonna get us a table.

274
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,471
Hey.

275
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,835
- Do you know that girl?
- Who?

276
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,875
The one at the register.

277
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,001
Not really.

278
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,341
She's on scholarship.
Like I said, oil and water.

279
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:53,348
<i>It's</i> Romeo and Juliet.

280
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,215
<i>Kinda. Two worIds. </i>

281
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,318
He's rich, she's poor.

282
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,448
Things wouldn't be kosher
if they were dating.

283
00:15:59,591 --> 00:16:01,889
Are they?
<i>Neither of them are fessing up. </i>

284
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,152
And he's got a very public girlfriend.

285
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:06,187
This is kinda cool.

286
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,664
We're like a team.

287
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,089
A team?

288
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,700
Yeah, like the Wonder Twins,
except we're not twins...

289
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,564
I don't have any super powers.

290
00:16:16,241 --> 00:16:18,038
Yeah. I should get back.

291
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:20,704
Romeo's getting me nowhere.
I'll try my luck with Juliet.

292
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,607
Good luck, because you know
how well that turned out.

293
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,675
Yeah.

294
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,829
I was wondering
if you could help me. I'm lost.

295
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,229
Who isn't?

296
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:45,000
Not a fan of this place?

297
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:46,929
Of high school?

298
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,432
I see your point.

299
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:53,567
I saw you in line in the cafeteria.

300
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,279
- Tru.
- Jen.

301
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,276
DeLuca.

302
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,983
I caught your name tag.

303
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:02,277
Adam was showing me around.

304
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,720
He seems to have a way with the ladies.

305
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,651
Yeah. I wouldn't know.

306
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,454
He's not really my type.

307
00:17:10,262 --> 00:17:12,253
Yeah, not my brother's either.

308
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,100
That's one headache I don't need.

309
00:17:18,237 --> 00:17:20,501
Your brother doesn't like Adam?

310
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:22,867
No. Derek hates everybody.

311
00:17:22,975 --> 00:17:25,671
You ask a lot of questions
for a prospective.

312
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,007
See you.

313
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,917
Who's your new friend?

314
00:17:35,988 --> 00:17:37,512
Shut up and drive.

315
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,066
Morgue.

316
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,509
<i>Run a DMV check for me. </i>

317
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,339
Someone nicked my brother's car
and didn't leave a note.

318
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,144
The guy's name is Derek DeLuca.

319
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,310
The guy who stole your car gave his name?

320
00:18:07,386 --> 00:18:09,149
Look, not a lot of time here.

321
00:18:09,221 --> 00:18:10,210
<i>AII right. </i>

322
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:16,392
Bingo. Derek DeLuca.

323
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:19,397
<i>Looks Iike he's got a coupIe</i>
<i>of outstanding speeding tickets. </i>

324
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:21,865
You wouldn't
happen to have an address?

325
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,538
Hey.

326
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:37,804
Hey.

327
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:43,014
Aren't you the girl from the school?

328
00:18:43,355 --> 00:18:47,052
I was giving myself a tour around town,
and I saw you in the driveway.

329
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,593
What are you working on?

330
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:51,026
I'm just tweaking the air mixture.

331
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,525
How come you don't go to Highland?

332
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:59,002
You've seen
those trust- fund casualties.

333
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:00,830
Why do I want to hang out with them?

334
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,807
What, you don't like chilling with rich boys
and their expensive rides?

335
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,707
Can't say I'm a fan.

336
00:19:07,779 --> 00:19:10,270
Of expensive rides,
or the boys who drive them?

337
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:12,442
Like Adam Whitman?

338
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,988
Don't tell me you're a friend of Whitman's.

339
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,182
I'm not a friend of anybody's yet.

340
00:19:19,258 --> 00:19:21,021
But why, what's your issue with him?

341
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:24,426
His dad runs the glass factory out on 22.

342
00:19:24,596 --> 00:19:27,190
He fired about 300 people last month.

343
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:29,332
My dad was one of them.

344
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:32,195
You seen Adam's new ride?

345
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,341
Probably bought it with the savings
from the layoffs.

346
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:39,675
I think you and I both know
it's not about the car.

347
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,038
It's about the driver.

348
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:46,012
Guess we'll see tonight.

349
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:49,419
What do you mean?
I'm racing Adam.

350
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,115
You should come see for yourself.

351
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,249
Car race.

352
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,051
Where?

353
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:58,392
Lakewood Cliff. Two hours.

354
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,516
I've got a where, but not a how.

355
00:20:18,584 --> 00:20:21,747
If it happens at the race,
it'd explain Adam's death but not Jen's.

356
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,288
I don't know how they ended up
in the car together.

357
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,050
Maybe they weren't.

358
00:20:26,758 --> 00:20:29,522
What do you mean?
<i>'Cause it Iooks Iike an accident...</i>

359
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:31,028
doesn't mean that it is.

360
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,087
You should know, in our business...

361
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,690
<i>things aren't aIways</i>
<i>what they appear to be. </i>

362
00:20:37,436 --> 00:20:38,630
Thanks, Davis.

363
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,039
I've never had anyone help me before.

364
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,035
I've never had anyone to help.

365
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:02,726
Do you have a booth?
Something quiet? We have work to do.

366
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:04,762
All right. Right this way.

367
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:17,208
Lindsay, is that you?

368
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,639
Harrison.

369
00:21:21,046 --> 00:21:22,707
What a surprise.

370
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,908
Tru told me you were gonna be here.

371
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:28,077
Come here.
It is so great to see you!

372
00:21:28,387 --> 00:21:29,547
It is?

373
00:21:30,989 --> 00:21:33,150
What's up, my man? Harrison Davies.

374
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,657
I'm an old friend of Lindsay's.

375
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,992
You are?
Are you guys eating?

376
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:42,998
Because I am starving, and they have
this little shrimp thing...

377
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,763
that is just to die for.

378
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:51,031
So when I finally stopped,
everyone behind me was covered.

379
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:53,202
I'm talking head to toe.

380
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,477
And everyone was just glaring at me,
like I meant to do it.

381
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,750
So anyway, that's the most I ever puked.

382
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:03,853
What about you, Greggers?

383
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,389
Excuse me.

384
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:10,788
What the hell are you doing?

385
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:14,298
You are deliberately sabotaging drinks
with my boss.

386
00:22:14,366 --> 00:22:17,062
Apparently, I'm doing this
for your own good.

387
00:22:17,235 --> 00:22:19,703
Giving him every reason
to demote me to phones?

388
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:21,602
No. Preventing it.

389
00:22:21,707 --> 00:22:23,106
At least that's what I'm told.

390
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:25,234
Not that I know what to believe anymore.

391
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,539
Harrison, I swear to God....

392
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,945
Look, let's just say I have this friend.

393
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:32,641
Yeah, you got friends?

394
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:36,013
Okay, more like a friend of a friend.

395
00:22:36,321 --> 00:22:38,881
Anyway, she used to work for Greg
until she found out...

396
00:22:38,957 --> 00:22:42,518
that"after- hour drinks" were a quick way
for him to get into her--

397
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,653
Okay, stop, please.

398
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,755
You're the only one
that would take it there.

399
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:49,767
Gregory and I are here to work.

400
00:22:51,737 --> 00:22:52,931
Whatever you say.

401
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,836
How much horsepower?

402
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,508
Hitting 425, going for 12 seconds.

403
00:23:03,615 --> 00:23:05,708
108?
You don't have to do this.

404
00:23:05,784 --> 00:23:07,479
It'll be over before you know it.

405
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,578
And then we'll have
the rest of the night for us.

406
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,489
Hey.

407
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,550
Got a minute?

408
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,789
I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

409
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:20,422
How did you know we were gonna....

410
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,763
You can't do this. This race.

411
00:23:22,968 --> 00:23:25,061
I'll be fine.
No, you won't.

412
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:28,832
Something's gonna go very wrong.
This thing Derek has against you--

413
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:31,039
Is that what this is about?

414
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:34,109
Don't sweat it. I'm way ahead of you.

415
00:23:36,214 --> 00:23:37,306
Yo, Derek.

416
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,677
Ready to go?

417
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,244
Only if I'm riding with insurance.
lnsurance?

418
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,984
Yeah. He takes one of mine,
I take one of his.

419
00:23:47,058 --> 00:23:49,026
<i>Make sure you know</i>
<i>no one's pIaying around. </i>

420
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,755
Fine. I'll take him.

421
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,834
I'll take her.

422
00:24:09,347 --> 00:24:11,747
No, you can't do this. I'm serious.

423
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,077
Just watch. You'll love it.

424
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,425
You look worried.

425
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:28,357
How should I look when someone I love
is doing something stupid.

426
00:24:28,433 --> 00:24:30,663
I'm sorry, I can't watch this.

427
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:49,010
You ready for the ride of your life?

428
00:24:49,554 --> 00:24:51,886
Go, Derek. It's your birthday.

429
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,557
Watch out!

430
00:26:04,963 --> 00:26:05,952
What's she doing?

431
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,498
<i>She's crazy! </i>

432
00:26:07,832 --> 00:26:09,732
Come on! You just cut me off!

433
00:26:49,307 --> 00:26:52,003
You jumped out
in the middle of the street.

434
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,006
<i>Are you insane? </i>

435
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,913
There's no way
I was gonna go over the cliff.

436
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:00,451
Let it go. You're alive, and you won.

437
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,748
I'm happy, you're happy.

438
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,386
Fair enough. Look, have you seen Amy?

439
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,688
I can't believe she just took off like that.

440
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,852
Here's a hint:

441
00:27:09,928 --> 00:27:13,591
Girls in the movies like guys for their cars.

442
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,832
But girls in real life like guys
for who they are.

443
00:27:20,105 --> 00:27:21,595
Thank you.

444
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,506
Hey, where you going?

445
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,271
Back to real life.

446
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,888
Hey. What are you doing right now?

447
00:27:44,095 --> 00:27:46,222
So, nice work. The table.

448
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,458
I usually get stuck by the kitchen.

449
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,160
Yeah, I do what I can.

450
00:27:50,235 --> 00:27:52,601
Since our time always gets cut short...

451
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,194
I want to skip all the work talk...

452
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,933
and move right to anything
other than work.

453
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:59,875
Good call. But first, no interruptions.

454
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:00,842
Okay.

455
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,280
All right, I'll start.

456
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,106
What sport did you play growing up?

457
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,345
- Track. You?
- Baseball.

458
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,218
Red Vines or Twizzlers?

459
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,085
Twizzlers, of course.

460
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:15,252
I'm strictly a Red Vines guy.

461
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,657
It's hopeless.

462
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:19,162
Tragic. I'm dating a Red Vines guy.

463
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,125
My turn. First kiss?

464
00:28:23,735 --> 00:28:25,965
Mandy Banks. Fifth grade.

465
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,734
Worst gift you ever gave a girl?

466
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:32,070
To Adrian O'Malley when I was 13.

467
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:35,840
I didn't realize that a gold necklace
should cost more than $3. 95.

468
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,642
Necklace.

469
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,310
You see that necklace?

470
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:43,311
She wasn't wearing it.

471
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:46,016
Not after it turned
her entire neck green, no.

472
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:53,556
This isn't gonna make any sense at all,
but I have to go.

473
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:54,924
Are you okay?

474
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:57,126
No. Really, I'm insane...

475
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,966
because I'm about to walk out
on a date that's working.

476
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,768
But it's just
there's somewhere I have to be.

477
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,708
Right now?

478
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:06,743
There are times when I do this.

479
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:10,110
Take off. I really wish I could explain why...

480
00:29:10,181 --> 00:29:13,912
but I guess I'm just not
your average 22- year- old girl.

481
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,414
Whether you believe me or not,
I'll call you...

482
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,617
and if you're willing
to give it another try, that's great.

483
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:23,456
If not, I'll understand.

484
00:29:24,028 --> 00:29:25,188
No, I won't.

485
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:28,232
I'll be completely crushed, but I'll get it.

486
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:32,726
Thanks. Really, I had a good time.

487
00:29:46,084 --> 00:29:47,517
Yeah, right.

488
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:49,212
Where's Adam?
He's around somewhere.

489
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:49,616
Where's Adam?
He's around somewhere.

490
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:50,949
What about Jen?

491
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:53,388
I saw her over there a few minutes ago.

492
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,687
What the hell is going on?

493
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:48,279
Amy.

494
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:53,980
- What are you....
- Adam, I'm so sorry.

495
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,324
I knew things weren't great between us,
but how could you--

496
00:31:01,426 --> 00:31:03,758
- Adam, why don't--
- Okay, shut up.

497
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,827
I wanted to tell you.

498
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,161
I didn't know how.

499
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,699
Looks like you figured it out, huh?

500
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:32,851
I'm so sorry.

501
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,121
For what?

502
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,727
They're all gonna know.

503
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,064
Everyone's gonna know.

504
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,236
Then we'll deal with it.

505
00:31:48,873 --> 00:31:52,036
Remember what we always said
we'd do if people found out?

506
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,647
I don't know.

507
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,177
I've lived here my whole life.

508
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,180
I mean, it's messed up, but it's home.

509
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,251
How they'll look at us?

510
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:12,290
It won't work here.

511
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,331
We won't work here.

512
00:32:17,969 --> 00:32:20,028
We have to leave, Jen.

513
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,740
Please.

514
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:35,182
All right. Go home and pack.

515
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,846
I'll pick you up in half an hour.

516
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,948
Everything is gonna be fine.

517
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,899
Remember how I said
this was <i>Romeo and JuIiet? </i>

518
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:54,370
I was wrong. It's Juliet and Juliet.

519
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,664
Are you joking?

520
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:58,732
No. Amy and Jen.

521
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,538
They're the ones in love.

522
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,306
<i>They didn't die during the race. </i>

523
00:33:02,413 --> 00:33:04,881
I don't know what's gonna happen, but....

524
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,187
- Hello?
- I gotta go.

525
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,044
Tru.

526
00:33:17,495 --> 00:33:18,553
Okay.

527
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:20,391
My round. Lindsay?

528
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,794
Greggers, my man?

529
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:25,294
No, thanks.

530
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,861
Fine. Keep my seat warm.

531
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:38,173
I am so sorry.
This is not what I wanted for tonight.

532
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,982
Neither did I.

533
00:33:40,051 --> 00:33:41,609
We have a few minutes.

534
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,450
I could at least go through
some of the proposals that I--

535
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,548
If we've only got a few minutes...

536
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,025
then let's not waste it on work.

537
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,400
He was right?

538
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:01,633
You should--
You should call it a night.

539
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,335
It's getting late.

540
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,399
You're an important guy.

541
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,411
You want to be fresh
for those morning meetings.

542
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,475
You're probably right.

543
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:13,682
See you tomorrow.

544
00:34:13,751 --> 00:34:14,979
Gregory.

545
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,312
Don't forget this.

546
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,457
<i>We can discuss it tomorrow at the office? </i>

547
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:22,316
Right.

548
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,791
Good night.

549
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,495
Wow. This is a first.

550
00:34:32,036 --> 00:34:33,731
Thanks, Harrison.

551
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,048
Hello?

552
00:34:44,382 --> 00:34:45,406
Are you ready?

553
00:34:45,716 --> 00:34:46,944
Yeah, I'm ready.

554
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:48,582
<i>I know we have to do this. </i>

555
00:34:48,653 --> 00:34:50,245
I love you.

556
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:51,788
I love you, too.

557
00:34:51,856 --> 00:34:54,324
<i>I'II be there in a few. </i>
<i>Meet me out front. </i>

558
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,652
What are you doing?

559
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,253
Who were you talking to?

560
00:35:00,364 --> 00:35:01,729
Nobody.

561
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,893
No? You said,"I love you."

562
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:05,731
It's none of your business.

563
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:10,306
Where are you going?
Get out!

564
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:14,105
It's Adam. I knew when he
picked you there was something.

565
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:16,043
You have no idea
what you're talking about!

566
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,309
He picked me because I'm your sister.

567
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,745
Just tell me where you're going.

568
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:24,819
Out of my way!

569
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,806
What are you doing here?

570
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,173
- Please, just, can you get in?
- No way.

571
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:50,008
Come on, Jen, just get in.
I've chilled. Seriously.

572
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:52,311
I just want to talk to you.

573
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:54,150
About what?

574
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,083
Look, I can't find Amy.

575
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,281
<i>So the Ieast you can do</i>
<i>is give me a minute. </i>

576
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,381
You owe me that.

577
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:02,015
One minute.

578
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,597
Exactly!

579
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,171
Damn it, Harrison!
Change your oil once in a while!

580
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,149
Derek.

581
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,081
Babe, I'm kinda busy!

582
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,914
I know it's none of my business...

583
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,352
but your sister's with Adam,
and we gotta stop them.

584
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:33,390
You read my mind. Hop in.

585
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:41,354
He's upset. And with the way he drives,
I think something might happen.

586
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,069
You said you wanted to talk.
You don't have to drive fast.

587
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:53,336
How long has this been going on?

588
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:56,905
- A few months.
- A few months?

589
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,881
I wanted her to tell you.
No.

590
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:12,826
I can't believe he thinks
he can bag my sister.

591
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:14,159
She's not sleeping with him.

592
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,099
What do you think they're doing?
Playing Candyland?

593
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,037
Adam, can you slow down?

594
00:37:22,273 --> 00:37:23,831
I'd just like a few answers.

595
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,468
I got in the car
because you need to know something.

596
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:27,805
Talk fast.

597
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,481
It's not your fault.

598
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,677
<i>ReaIIy, Adam. </i>

599
00:37:34,752 --> 00:37:36,777
<i>She didn't know how to teII you. </i>

600
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,347
She loves you.

601
00:37:43,127 --> 00:37:45,061
But she's in love with you.

602
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:03,236
The necklace.

603
00:38:04,382 --> 00:38:05,610
I was gonna get it for her.

604
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:09,278
She was looking at it in the window
of this jewelry store forever.

605
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,318
<i>Now I know why. </i>

606
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,914
She wanted to give it to you.

607
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,753
You're her best friend, Adam.

608
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:18,556
<i>That's why it was so hard. </i>

609
00:38:18,863 --> 00:38:20,990
She didn't want to hurt you.

610
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,230
Thinking he's all hard, huh?

611
00:38:30,775 --> 00:38:31,833
What are you doing?

612
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,773
Trying to tap my sister in daddy's car?

613
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:37,439
You gotta get out of the car.
I can't! It won't. The door's jammed.

614
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:40,847
Your sister's in that car! Stop it!
Just shut up!

615
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,212
You're gonna kill her!

616
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,414
I'm not gonna hurt my sister.
She needs a little scare.

617
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,055
Stop, you'll push them over!

618
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:50,093
There's a guardrail. I'm just bumping them.

619
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,253
It won't hold.

620
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,591
The guardrail gave way.

621
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:54,153
Stop! It won't hold!

622
00:38:57,034 --> 00:38:58,365
Poor little rich boy!

623
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,529
Derek, your sister's not in love with Adam.

624
00:39:00,638 --> 00:39:03,368
She's in love with Amy.

625
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,539
That's who she's running away with.

626
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:11,674
What?

627
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:34,193
I saw Derek's car.

628
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,335
So you're saying that at exactly this time...

629
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:09,973
you were with those two dead kids
at the crash site?

630
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,701
That's what I'm saying.

631
00:40:12,877 --> 00:40:15,038
So the girls aren't running away?

632
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:19,511
No. But it's not like it's all wrapped
up in a neat little bow.

633
00:40:20,184 --> 00:40:23,779
They've still gotta deal with life
now that their little secret is out.

634
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:26,755
If it weren't for you,
they wouldn't even have that.

635
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:29,255
If it weren't for us.

636
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:36,160
Sometimes just being able to talk
to someone can make it a lot easier.

637
00:40:39,069 --> 00:40:40,559
Who are those for?

638
00:40:40,638 --> 00:40:42,902
Amy and Jen gave them to me...

639
00:40:42,973 --> 00:40:45,373
for helping them deal with their secret.

640
00:40:47,745 --> 00:40:50,145
And I'm giving them to you...

641
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:54,282
for helping me deal with mine.

642
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,219
<i>Yo, Bro. </i>

643
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:05,586
Tru?

644
00:41:06,697 --> 00:41:07,823
How you doing?

645
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:08,990
<i>Fine. </i>

646
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,124
Aren't you gonna ask me about your baby?

647
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:12,533
What baby?

648
00:41:12,603 --> 00:41:13,627
<i>Your car. </i>

649
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,136
Thought that'd be
the first thing out of your mouth.

650
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,231
<i>Yeah, right. </i>

651
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:20,037
Sorry, I'm just a little busy right now.

652
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:23,476
Just real quick,
tell me how things went with Lindsay.

653
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,744
Great. No worries. Mission accomplished.

654
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:28,743
You okay?

655
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,118
Yeah, I'm fine. Look, where are you?

656
00:41:32,189 --> 00:41:33,417
My apartment.

657
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,354
<i>I gotta change to go meet someone. </i>

658
00:41:35,426 --> 00:41:37,587
I don't know if that's the best...

659
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,122
idea.

660
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,896
Oh, my God.

661
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:46,900
Harrison.

662
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:53,035
You know, when most girls get up
and run away during the first date...

663
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:54,337
it's usually a bad sign.

664
00:41:54,445 --> 00:41:55,935
I said I'd call.

665
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,248
Yeah. I thought you meant, like, Tuesday.

666
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,250
Yeah, my timing's been a little off lately.

667
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,252
Can you handle it?

668
00:42:03,654 --> 00:42:05,178
I think I can.

669
00:42:05,623 --> 00:42:09,081
'Cause maybe I'm not looking
for an average 22- year- old.

670
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,995
So you're free all night?
Not going anywhere?

671
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:16,698
I'm all yours.

672
00:42:20,571 --> 00:42:22,300
You know, a friend of mine was saying...

673
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,206
that real life can't be like the movies...

674
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,705
that maybe sometimes
things are better left to mystery.

675
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:36,881
What good is a mystery
if you don't try and figure it out?
