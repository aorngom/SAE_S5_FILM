LlNDSAY: Yep.

668

He also spent the entire evening talking
about his new track buddy named Jack.

No kidding?

You gonna be all right?

Yesterday, l went to the diner.

You were following me,
just like you did today.

-Yesterday? l didn't go--
-You want to hear this or not?

682

There was a holdup at the diner.
You were shot and killed.

683

After you died, you asked for my help.

l had to try and prevent a crime spree...

687
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:45,081
which you tipped me off on yesterday.
And thanks for that, by the way.

688
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:48,676
But you ended up at the diner anyway,
because that's how fate wanted it.

689
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:52,052
So now you want me to think
you're just plain nuts?

So did the medallion keep you safe?

711

No, Davis. lt was you who kept me safe.
You called the police.
