1
00:00:49,973 --> 00:00:53,807
Hey, Tru. Glad I caught up.
You got a full schedule for today?

2
00:00:53,973 --> 00:00:56,203
Just chem lab.
Then the rest of the day is mine.

6
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:58,933
That is excellent, because I have
two tickets to the Blue Spot...

7
00:00:59,093 --> 00:01:00,446
...the Scott Rogo Quintet.

8
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:04,208
- Uh, Jensen, I'm sorry, but I hate jazz.
- Me too.

9
00:01:04,413 --> 00:01:06,529
- Lexi's the one that wanted to go.
- Oops.

10
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:10,448
Hey, tell you what, I bet you we could
get 50 bucks for them in the parking lot.

11
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:14,003
- I've never been scalping.
- Swing by after class.

13
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:20,524
<i>- Hey, Harr.</i>
- Guess what. Oh, you'll never guess.

14
00:01:20,693 --> 00:01:24,083
Unless it's day two, in which case
you're probably gonna tell me about it.

15
00:01:24,253 --> 00:01:26,687
- Harrison, I have class in 90 seconds.
- <i>Fine.</i>

16
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:30,363
One of Dad's clients says his partner's
ripping him off. We got a tip...

17
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:33,605
...the partner's guys are moving
a load of hot electronics tonight.

18
00:01:33,773 --> 00:01:36,287
And he needs pictures.
I'm the shutter man.

19
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:38,961
- It's not dangerous, is it?
- Only if I screw it up.

20
00:01:39,133 --> 00:01:41,169
You're not gonna screw up.
You're gonna be great.

21
00:01:41,373 --> 00:01:45,810
Aw. That'd mean more to me
on a day two, but thanks for the effort.

22
00:01:46,173 --> 00:01:47,401
Bye.

23
00:01:51,693 --> 00:01:52,887
Okay.

24
00:01:55,253 --> 00:01:57,926
I have waited a week,
so to the hell with the rules...

25
00:01:58,093 --> 00:02:00,812
...somebody has got to ask
somebody out for a date.

26
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:05,209
How about dinner?

27
00:02:05,413 --> 00:02:10,328
- Now? It's 9:30 in the morning.
- Actually, I was thinking of later tonight.

28
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:14,887
Yes. Oh, yeah, of course, yes.
And yes. Yes.

29
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:18,449
Great. I'll cook.
Can we use your place, though?

30
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:21,805
- Uh...
- My stove refuses to cooperate.

31
00:02:22,013 --> 00:02:25,926
Okay, yeah, I just have to leave
a little early to tidy up.

32
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:28,772
- I'll see you at 7.
- Okay.

33
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,962
Seven o'clock.
I should probably leave now.

35
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:09,207
I always wanted to learn the guitar.

36
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,930
You know, I've seen you before.

37
00:03:16,693 --> 00:03:18,843
A bunch of times, really.
You work around here?

38
00:03:19,013 --> 00:03:24,406
- Uh, yeah. All over the city, actually.
- I'm not stalking you.

39
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:26,410
It's just...

40
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:30,885
I know this is kind of out of nowhere,
but, um, I'm playing hooky today.

41
00:03:31,893 --> 00:03:34,930
And I have two tickets
to see this jazz quintet...

42
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:38,808
...at the Blue Spot tonight.
If you're not too booked up...

43
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:41,083
...maybe you'd like to come with.

44
00:03:41,773 --> 00:03:43,650
I can't.

45
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,769
Work's a killer.

46
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:49,049
Maybe some other time.

47
00:03:59,253 --> 00:04:01,926
Two tickets to the jazz festival.
Do I hear 20? Twenty?

48
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,163
- No, I don't hear 20.
- Do I hear 15? Do I hear 10?

49
00:04:04,373 --> 00:04:06,489
Hey, we have the perfect date.
We just have to run...

50
00:04:06,653 --> 00:04:07,972
We've got the perfect date?

51
00:04:08,173 --> 00:04:11,370
- For $20. For two?
- Seriously, $5. I'll pay you.

52
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:12,801
Oh, you're back. No?

54
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:22,486
- You made all this in my kitchen?
- I did. Don't you cook?

55
00:04:22,773 --> 00:04:28,245
Uh, I've made gazpacho a couple
of times, but nothing like this.

56
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:33,731
Mmm.

57
00:04:33,933 --> 00:04:36,288
This is delicious. Mmm. What is this?

58
00:04:36,493 --> 00:04:37,642
Tuna Provencal.

59
00:04:38,053 --> 00:04:39,372
Mmm.

60
00:04:41,053 --> 00:04:43,487
- What? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

61
00:04:44,213 --> 00:04:47,250
It's just the mercury levels
are kind of high and...

62
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,447
It's probably what gives
it the extra tang.

63
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:57,648
- Wine's good. Yeah. That's good wine.
- Relax.

65
00:04:59,453 --> 00:05:03,128
- It's just me.
- I know, I'm sorry, it's just...

66
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:06,888
I'm nervous. Nervous because this
is the first time that a woman...

67
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:09,726
...has cooked here for me,
and it's...

68
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:12,447
I totally get it.
But, you know, maybe...

69
00:05:12,653 --> 00:05:16,885
...tonight'll turn out to be
an evening full of first times.

71
00:05:18,213 --> 00:05:19,487
Oh.

72
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,963
Oh, God, I'm such an idiot.
I thought it was a dog.

73
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:28,325
<i>Coogan takes a hit. Then another.</i>

74
00:05:29,973 --> 00:05:31,691
Smile for the birdie, suckers.

75
00:05:31,853 --> 00:05:34,845
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is not</i>
<i>the way it was supposed to go.</i>

76
00:05:36,693 --> 00:05:40,368
<i>I bet Coogan wishes he hadn 't</i>
<i>bothered showing up tonight, Bob.</i>

77
00:05:41,733 --> 00:05:44,452
<i>And he goes down. Coogan goes down.</i>

78
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:47,126
<i>It's all over.</i>

79
00:05:47,293 --> 00:05:48,851
Billy.

80
00:05:50,093 --> 00:05:52,084
<i>I tell you, folks.</i>

81
00:05:52,813 --> 00:05:56,772
<i>Somebody... Somebody</i>
<i>should've seen this coming.</i>

82
00:05:58,453 --> 00:06:01,968
<i>And it's official. Coogan is out,</i>
<i>and the challenger...</i>

83
00:06:02,373 --> 00:06:05,729
You're kidding me, that's awful. What
did you do, just throw away the film?

84
00:06:05,893 --> 00:06:07,167
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

85
00:06:07,373 --> 00:06:10,570
I've known Billy since high school.
If I didn't have a job with Dad...

86
00:06:10,733 --> 00:06:13,611
<i>...I'd be loading the truck up with him.</i>
- What did you tell Dad?

87
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:19,325
I lied. I told him the light was bad
and the shots were underexposed.

88
00:06:19,493 --> 00:06:20,767
Oh, God, he was pissed.

89
00:06:20,973 --> 00:06:24,090
<i>Look, I don 't know if I can do it.</i>
<i>I'm taking pictures of my friend.</i>

90
00:06:24,253 --> 00:06:28,849
You're doing great, Harrison.
Look, no one ever said it would be easy.

91
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:32,602
Oh, it doesn't have to be easy, Tru.
I just wish it wasn't so hard.

92
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:35,407
- I know.
<i>- Anyway, I gotta go.</i>

93
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:37,131
Bye.

94
00:06:37,813 --> 00:06:41,089
- Six sugars, right?
- Seven, but I'll live.

95
00:07:06,133 --> 00:07:08,601
Oh, it's fantastic, Avery.
Thanks for calling.

96
00:07:08,773 --> 00:07:12,004
I just won a bunch of money on the
Coogan fight in the med-school pool.

97
00:07:12,173 --> 00:07:14,892
- Ten bucks on Montez turned into 100.
- Wow.

98
00:07:15,053 --> 00:07:17,851
- Yeah.
- Boxing, scalping, gambling.

99
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:20,163
Don't let the GPA fool you.
I'm a gangster. Holler back.

102
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:24,892
Yeah.

103
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:27,089
Operation Seduce Davis
did not go as planned.

104
00:07:27,253 --> 00:07:29,448
I don't know.
I think I may have come on too strong.

105
00:07:29,613 --> 00:07:30,648
What happened?

106
00:07:30,853 --> 00:07:35,085
I tried to let him know that I was
interested in him, you know, physically.

107
00:07:35,453 --> 00:07:38,172
- And he didn't respond?
<i>- No, he responded.</i>

108
00:07:38,373 --> 00:07:40,728
Like I goosed him with a cattle prod.

109
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:44,803
Some guys just need
a little warming up.

110
00:07:44,973 --> 00:07:46,292
No!

111
00:07:47,453 --> 00:07:49,205
- Call you back.
<i>- Okay.</i>

112
00:07:49,413 --> 00:07:53,372
And I was thinking that
maybe you and I should, uh...

113
00:07:53,533 --> 00:07:55,603
...you know, get together on Saturday.

114
00:07:55,773 --> 00:07:57,650
And scalp <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> tickets?

115
00:07:57,813 --> 00:08:00,532
Yeah, that's exactly
what I had in mind.

116
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,327
She jumped. I'll call 911.

117
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:08,772
I saw the whole thing.

118
00:08:08,933 --> 00:08:10,810
She jumped from the very top.

119
00:08:11,813 --> 00:08:12,848
Somebody call 911.

120
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:22,645
- Who was with her?
- She just jumped.

121
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:26,052
Jack.

122
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:36,646
Help me.

123
00:08:43,693 --> 00:08:45,923
- What the hell was that?
- What the hell was that?

124
00:09:00,613 --> 00:09:02,251
Help me!

125
00:09:21,213 --> 00:09:24,683
It was different. It didn't feel
like a normal rewind at all.

126
00:09:24,853 --> 00:09:27,765
- As bizarre as that sounds.
- No one asked for help, you're sure?

127
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30,208
There were no corpses lying around
if that's what you mean.

128
00:09:30,373 --> 00:09:32,933
- Well, maybe you didn't hear it.
- I always hear it.

129
00:09:33,453 --> 00:09:36,092
Well, do you think maybe you died?

130
00:09:36,253 --> 00:09:38,130
Okay, now you're just creeping me out.

132
00:09:41,253 --> 00:09:43,244
Okay, what were you doing
when it happened?

133
00:09:43,413 --> 00:09:45,688
I was about to...

134
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:49,011
...do something personal.

135
00:09:49,613 --> 00:09:53,083
Okay. Describe the rewind.
What did you see?

136
00:09:53,253 --> 00:09:56,689
Like I said, it was weird.
It was just, like, random stuff.

137
00:09:56,853 --> 00:09:58,809
There was a painting.

138
00:10:00,173 --> 00:10:02,209
There was a music poster.

139
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:06,606
There was a guitar case.
There were coins.

140
00:10:07,613 --> 00:10:10,047
And there was a $20 bill, like a...

141
00:10:10,213 --> 00:10:12,807
In the case. It was a street performer
or something.

142
00:10:12,973 --> 00:10:15,328
There's always a bunch like
that at Atlantic Plaza.

143
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:22,169
That was the last thing I saw.
It was the clock on the Edison Tower.

144
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:27,322
It was 11: 15, and the clock,
it was moving away, like I was falling.

145
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:31,532
- Tru, I'm... This may be a little crazy...
- What?

146
00:10:31,693 --> 00:10:35,242
Well, maybe that's how the victim died.
Falling off the Edison Tower. Maybe.

147
00:10:35,413 --> 00:10:37,165
There is an observation deck.

148
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,642
But, Davis, we're not even
sure there was a victim.

150
00:10:41,293 --> 00:10:44,763
- I wonder if anyone actually died.
- I hate this.

151
00:10:44,973 --> 00:10:47,533
Right when I thought I had
the right approach to this.

152
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:52,124
The rules have changed.
I mean, we're in open water now.

153
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:54,204
This rewind...

154
00:10:55,693 --> 00:10:57,923
...it felt bad.

155
00:10:59,933 --> 00:11:01,730
Cold.

156
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:04,643
Like a part of me was dying.

157
00:11:06,413 --> 00:11:09,610
All I know is I never wanna
feel that way again.

158
00:11:09,973 --> 00:11:11,452
I never felt anything like it.

159
00:11:11,613 --> 00:11:14,650
I don't know what to tell you. I've never
heard of anything like this before.

160
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:17,452
- She asked me for help.
- Don't get knocked off track here.

161
00:11:17,653 --> 00:11:19,689
Doing the right thing is always harder.

162
00:11:19,893 --> 00:11:22,282
But if the rules changed this time,
it's for a reason.

163
00:11:22,453 --> 00:11:26,207
Your job has always been clear.
Make today end like yesterday.

164
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,769
What the hell am I supposed to do?

165
00:11:31,053 --> 00:11:33,044
Your job.

166
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,442
Harrison, wait.

167
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:44,332
Oh, no, no. No, it's one of those days,
right, where l...

168
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,364
Relax. You don't die or anything.

169
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:49,690
- Oh, whew. Cool.
- I tried to call you on your cell...

170
00:11:49,853 --> 00:11:52,890
...but I wanted you to know. Dad's
gonna give you some big assignment.

171
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:54,645
To photograph a crime taking place.

172
00:11:54,813 --> 00:11:57,247
- Very cool.
- Your friend Billy's one of the criminals.

173
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:59,210
You take pictures, he could go to jail.

174
00:11:59,413 --> 00:12:02,689
Not cool. Because if I don't,
then I'm gonna be in trouble with...

175
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:04,929
- Dad!
- Hey.

176
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:08,731
- What a pleasant surprise.
- Hey.

177
00:12:08,933 --> 00:12:10,889
You feel all right, sweetie?
You look tired.

178
00:12:11,093 --> 00:12:14,244
Well, you know how it goes,
Dad. I work in a morgue.

179
00:12:14,453 --> 00:12:18,651
I only get a day off
if death takes a day off.

180
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:27,564
Carrie, it's day two
and here's the headline:

181
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:30,293
At your dinner tonight with Davis,
take it down a notch.

182
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:34,287
Go easy. Don't be easy. You
know what I'm saying? Call me.

184
00:12:47,613 --> 00:12:51,208
You know, I've always wanted
to learn to play the guitar.

185
00:12:51,453 --> 00:12:54,013
- Me too.
- I guess we still could.

186
00:12:54,213 --> 00:12:57,250
Probably takes years, though, right?
Who's got that kind of time?

188
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:06,291
You know, um...

189
00:13:06,893 --> 00:13:10,806
...my work threw me a curve ball
today and canceled all my meetings.

190
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,804
Do you wanna get some breakfast?

191
00:13:14,173 --> 00:13:16,733
- I think I have time for that.
- Great.

192
00:13:17,773 --> 00:13:20,685
You strike me as a traditionalist
when it comes to breakfast.

193
00:13:20,853 --> 00:13:24,846
Oh, I don't know about that.
No. I go a little crazy.

194
00:13:39,813 --> 00:13:41,166
Wow, a 20.

195
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:44,848
- Someone must really like your music.
- Actually, he liked the girl next to him.

196
00:13:45,053 --> 00:13:47,408
- He was trying to impress her.
- Her?

197
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,171
Yeah, you just missed them.

198
00:13:50,253 --> 00:13:52,209
Thanks.

199
00:13:52,893 --> 00:13:57,364
So it must be a great job you have.
You can just show up when you want...

200
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,171
...not show up when you want.

201
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:04,851
Well, I'm sort of a troubleshooter. I try
to keep things from veering off course.

202
00:14:05,013 --> 00:14:08,244
- You?
- I was a receptionist at St. Luke's.

203
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,768
- Yesterday was my last day.
- You quit.

204
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:13,242
- Mm-hm.
- So, what's next?

205
00:14:13,413 --> 00:14:15,165
It remains to be seen.

206
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,051
But for today...

207
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:19,526
...I got a list.
- A list?

208
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,365
- Mm-hm.
- Why do I get the feeling...

209
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:24,252
...there's more to this story?
You mind if I took a look at that list?

210
00:14:24,413 --> 00:14:27,564
No. It's private!

211
00:14:27,773 --> 00:14:29,764
It's just some stuff around town.

212
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:32,970
You can live in Paris your whole life
and never go to the Eiffel Tower.

213
00:14:33,133 --> 00:14:36,682
Mm-hm. What's number one to do
on the aforementioned list?

214
00:14:36,853 --> 00:14:38,332
Are you inviting yourself along?

215
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:42,088
Only if I'm welcome, and only if it
doesn't involve opera or clowns.

216
00:14:42,253 --> 00:14:44,721
You are. And it doesn't.

217
00:14:44,893 --> 00:14:47,407
I just hope you like dead ducks.

218
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:52,250
It was the last thing he ever painted.

219
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:55,726
I majored in art history.

220
00:14:55,893 --> 00:15:00,045
And my first big crush was
on Robert Vander Krawl.

221
00:15:00,773 --> 00:15:03,731
I stayed up all night writing an essay
on this very painting...

222
00:15:03,893 --> 00:15:06,009
...crying the entire time.

223
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,842
All he wanted was a normal life.

224
00:15:09,213 --> 00:15:11,852
A wife, family.

225
00:15:12,413 --> 00:15:14,608
He'd completed over 200 canvases...

226
00:15:14,773 --> 00:15:18,686
...by the time he was 29
and never sold a single one.

227
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:23,285
He killed himself one night with poison.

228
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:26,292
He was completely alone...

229
00:15:26,573 --> 00:15:30,612
...convinced that nobody cared
about him or his work...

230
00:15:30,853 --> 00:15:33,572
...that he was worth more
dead than alive.

231
00:15:35,773 --> 00:15:37,252
- Are you crying?
- Uh-uh.

232
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:38,687
- You okay?
- Mm-hm.

234
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,364
Hey, Jack!

235
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:49,331
Still haven't learned your manners?
I'm Tru Davies.

236
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:51,728
Megan Roberts. Nice to meet you.

237
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:55,327
So, what's new, Jack?

238
00:15:56,133 --> 00:15:58,442
- Would you give me a minute?
- Mm-hm. Sure.

239
00:16:00,413 --> 00:16:03,485
I know how you're getting
your inside information.

240
00:16:03,653 --> 00:16:05,484
You see the victim's day
when you rewind.

241
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:09,487
Very clever girl, Tru. It only took
you six months to figure that one out.

242
00:16:09,653 --> 00:16:11,245
Let me guess, you saw the painting?

243
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:14,246
Just my luck. This was
the first museum I tried.

244
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,163
She asked you for help, didn't she?

245
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:25,371
Wow. So obviously there's been some
kind of sick cosmic mix-up.

246
00:16:25,573 --> 00:16:28,246
Maybe not. Maybe it happened
this way for a reason.

247
00:16:28,413 --> 00:16:30,131
What are you saying,
you're gonna help her?

248
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,449
"Help me" doesn't always
mean "save me."

249
00:16:32,653 --> 00:16:34,848
The hell it doesn't.
Why else would she ask you?

250
00:16:35,013 --> 00:16:37,573
To be honest, I'm not sure yet.
But this much I do know:

251
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:40,327
She didn't ask you for help.
You've got no business here.

252
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:45,004
- Unless, of course, you intend to kill her.
- Oh, I wouldn't wanna step on your toes.

253
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:47,569
Actually, she's gonna
handle the hard part.

254
00:16:47,733 --> 00:16:49,724
What are you talking about?

255
00:16:50,933 --> 00:16:52,844
She's gonna kill herself.

256
00:16:53,693 --> 00:16:56,685
And if she doesn't wanna live,
she's got no use for you.

257
00:17:12,693 --> 00:17:15,605
Your guess was right, Davis.
Megan Roberts is definitely the victim.

258
00:17:15,813 --> 00:17:17,292
<i>She jumped off the Edison Tower.</i>

259
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:21,082
Okay, let's see. Megan Roberts,
28, attended Reed College.

260
00:17:21,253 --> 00:17:23,642
She, uh, graduated in 1997.

261
00:17:23,813 --> 00:17:27,044
Currently lives here in town
at 1025 Birch Lane.

262
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,886
There's also a Wendy Roberts,
could be a sister or mother.

263
00:17:30,053 --> 00:17:33,284
I don't get it. Why does someone
who wants to die ask for help?

264
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:35,290
Consider who she asked. Death himself.

265
00:17:35,493 --> 00:17:38,724
Yeah, but she was already dead.
What would she need from Jack?

266
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:42,772
More importantly, what
does she need from you?

267
00:17:59,373 --> 00:18:02,968
- Figured I'd find you here.
- Hey, man. Unbelievable.

268
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:07,331
- Hey, Billy. Hey, man, what is up, bro?
- Oh, you know, same old.

269
00:18:07,493 --> 00:18:10,690
We call you every Friday night,
Ed Bone's poker game, you never show.

270
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:12,684
I know, man. I've been crazy busy.

271
00:18:12,853 --> 00:18:15,731
- Yeah? What's her name?
- No. I got a job.

272
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,203
Yeah, I got a job. I'm working
for my old man.

273
00:18:18,413 --> 00:18:21,325
That's great. I thought you were
too cool to hang out with us.

274
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:22,966
No. Hey, man, can I get two?

275
00:18:23,173 --> 00:18:26,643
So how is everybody, man?
How's Larry doing?

276
00:18:26,813 --> 00:18:28,212
Oh, Fat Larry, man, he's in jail.

277
00:18:28,413 --> 00:18:29,846
- Oh, shut up.
- No, it's assault.

278
00:18:30,053 --> 00:18:31,691
He's looking at, like, eight years.

279
00:18:32,773 --> 00:18:35,082
- Wow.
- So, what, you came just to hang out...

280
00:18:35,253 --> 00:18:36,606
...and get faced or what?

281
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:39,532
Well, you see it's a little
hard to explain, actually, um...

282
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,930
Oh, I know why you're here.
I know that look.

283
00:18:43,853 --> 00:18:45,172
What look? What? What look?

284
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:47,847
The "I'm broke and I need
some cash," that's what look.

285
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:50,203
No. No, no. It's not that, man. It's...

286
00:18:50,373 --> 00:18:54,127
Chill. Don't worry. Let your big brother
Billy front you, all right? Check it.

287
00:18:54,293 --> 00:18:59,492
There's a job tonight. It's boxes
in the trucks. Easy-peasy. Hmm? Huh?

288
00:18:59,653 --> 00:19:04,522
Mmm. Yeah... No. I got a better idea.

289
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:06,649
We get some beers, grab some pizza...

290
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:09,327
...and go back to my place
and watch that Coogan fight.

291
00:19:09,533 --> 00:19:11,728
We'll just kick it old-school style,
me and you.

292
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:13,929
Not to worry, my brother.
You in. Come on.

293
00:19:15,373 --> 00:19:16,806
Sit.

295
00:19:25,653 --> 00:19:27,723
Hey. Wendy, right?

296
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:30,011
- Right.
- I'm Tru Davies.

297
00:19:30,173 --> 00:19:33,324
Megan and I used to be
floor mates back at Reed.

298
00:19:33,613 --> 00:19:37,447
- She does live here, right?
- Yeah, she does. Um...

299
00:19:38,133 --> 00:19:40,772
So, um, when was the last time
you and Megan talked?

300
00:19:40,933 --> 00:19:43,572
It's been mostly Christmas cards
the past couple of years.

301
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:46,122
Actually, I was starting
to get worried because...

302
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,608
...she hasn't returned
my last couple phone calls.

303
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:53,130
And the one time we did speak,
she sounded kind of distant.

304
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:56,290
Is everything all right?

305
00:19:56,613 --> 00:19:57,728
Look, um...

306
00:19:58,493 --> 00:20:00,688
Why don't you come inside.
We should talk.

307
00:20:06,733 --> 00:20:09,327
- Working late?
- As usual.

308
00:20:09,493 --> 00:20:10,687
Yeah. Me too.

309
00:20:10,853 --> 00:20:14,402
So I was thinking, what do you say
that we have dinner here together?

310
00:20:15,893 --> 00:20:17,372
- In the morgue?
- Sure.

311
00:20:17,573 --> 00:20:21,327
It'll be fun. Like a picnic, only
with cold tile instead of warm sand.

312
00:20:37,013 --> 00:20:41,165
- Hey, you go in. I'II, uh, meet you inside.
- Okay.

313
00:20:48,453 --> 00:20:50,444
- I have to talk to Megan.
- Stay out of this.

314
00:20:50,613 --> 00:20:51,887
She's dying.

315
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:55,051
I spoke to her sister.
She has leukemia.

316
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:59,252
You see, you don't have to do anything
tonight. She's gonna die anyway.

317
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:02,693
- Did you hear me?
- Yeah, I heard you.

318
00:21:04,213 --> 00:21:05,646
Thank you.

319
00:21:11,133 --> 00:21:12,168
Jack!

320
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,051
Whoa, whoa, where's your ticket?

321
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:15,851
I don't have one. How much are they?

322
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:19,483
We've been sold out for two weeks.
Good luck finding any.

323
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,289
Two tickets! I got two tickets for
the jazz. Anybody want two tickets?

324
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:26,205
- I'll take them.
- Hey.

325
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:27,971
Weird. I tried calling you earlier.

326
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:30,050
- How much you want for them?
- What, for these?

327
00:21:30,253 --> 00:21:33,006
- Nothing, you really want them?
- For us, we'll go, it'll be fun.

328
00:21:33,173 --> 00:21:35,209
No, I hate jazz, I don't wanna go.

329
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:38,405
Me too. But you know,
it's like lima beans.

330
00:21:39,373 --> 00:21:43,048
You have to check in every once in
a while to see if your taste has changed.

331
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,088
Come on.

332
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:47,171
- Hey.
- Hey, you okay?

333
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:48,686
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

334
00:21:48,853 --> 00:21:54,325
- Oh, don't tell me. You hate jazz.
- No, it's not that. It's just, um...

335
00:21:54,493 --> 00:21:57,291
Is there maybe something going on
that you're not telling me?

336
00:21:57,453 --> 00:22:01,002
Because I like you, Megan, and I think
we've been having a really great day.

337
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,929
- Then let's keep having it.
- I'd like that.

338
00:22:05,093 --> 00:22:08,130
But I get the feeling
there's not gonna be another one.

339
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:11,569
Let's say I told you I wanted
to see you again this weekend.

340
00:22:11,773 --> 00:22:13,684
What would you say to that?

341
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:18,730
- I'm not gonna be around this weekend.
- Where are you gonna be?

343
00:22:22,573 --> 00:22:24,848
Six months ago...

344
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,288
...I found out I have leukemia.

345
00:22:28,213 --> 00:22:30,329
The doctors give me a year.

346
00:22:30,853 --> 00:22:33,321
The first symptoms
came on pretty quick.

347
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:38,044
My sister had to quit her job last month
to take care of me when things got bad.

348
00:22:38,213 --> 00:22:40,568
From here on out, it only gets worse.

349
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:42,646
The good days...

350
00:22:42,853 --> 00:22:44,571
...like today...

351
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:48,692
...will slowly dwindle away to nothing.
The pain will get worse.

352
00:22:49,093 --> 00:22:51,004
Most people with
this kind of leukemia...

353
00:22:51,173 --> 00:22:54,245
...spend the last few months
of their lives in a hospital bed...

354
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:58,731
...hooked up to machines and tubes,
completely helpless.

355
00:22:59,653 --> 00:23:01,371
I will not die like that.

356
00:23:04,893 --> 00:23:06,406
This list.

357
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,211
It's 10 things I wanted to do
before I died.

359
00:23:11,853 --> 00:23:13,684
Only got around to four of them.

360
00:23:15,613 --> 00:23:17,968
Procrastinator till the end, I guess.

361
00:23:22,773 --> 00:23:25,048
Do the others for me, Jack.

362
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:29,771
One day I will see you again,
and you can tell me all about it.

363
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:34,369
This is your list.
You should do these things.

364
00:23:34,573 --> 00:23:39,203
When I was in bed these last few
weeks, I made a promise to myself.

365
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:45,012
If I could get just one more good day,
I would take advantage of it.

366
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:49,803
I have an insurance policy through work,
good only in case of accidental death.

367
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:51,770
A hundred thousand dollars.

368
00:23:53,213 --> 00:23:55,488
Mine's going to my sister.

369
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:59,246
- And you're gonna kill yourself?
- Not exactly.

370
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,169
I told you, the policy
doesn't pay on suicide.

371
00:24:05,173 --> 00:24:07,971
It has to look like an accident.

372
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:24,970
Oh, I should've seen this coming.

374
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:28,325
This Tru, is she an ex-girlfriend
or something?

375
00:24:28,493 --> 00:24:29,608
It's a long story.

376
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:31,769
Hey, you guys.
What a weird coincidence.

377
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:35,170
- Jack, Megan, this is Jensen Richie.
- Hey. I saw you at Tru's party.

378
00:24:35,333 --> 00:24:36,322
- How you doing?
- Good.

379
00:24:36,493 --> 00:24:39,405
First the museum, and now this.
We should all hang out together.

380
00:24:39,573 --> 00:24:41,245
Or not. You wanna get a drink, Megan?

381
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,728
- Yeah, it'd be great.
- I'll get us something too.

382
00:24:43,893 --> 00:24:46,487
Why don't you and Megan hang out.
We'll be right back.

383
00:24:50,013 --> 00:24:52,811
- Okay.
- Okay, what is it with those two?

384
00:24:53,053 --> 00:24:56,011
I don't know. But I'm sure
it's one hell of a story.

385
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:59,290
She has an insurance policy, $ 100,000.

386
00:24:59,453 --> 00:25:02,092
When she died on day one,
everyone thought it was suicide.

387
00:25:02,253 --> 00:25:06,326
Tonight it has to look like an accident.
That's the only way the policy pays off.

388
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,489
That's why she asked me for help.

389
00:25:08,693 --> 00:25:10,843
- And you're gonna do it?
- She wants this, Tru.

390
00:25:11,013 --> 00:25:14,005
She doesn't wanna suffer
through a long, slow, painful decline.

391
00:25:14,173 --> 00:25:17,006
It's her life. It's her death.
It's her decision.

392
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:20,330
I'm gonna talk to her, Jack, whether
you wanna try and stop me or not.

393
00:25:20,893 --> 00:25:22,611
Be my guest.

394
00:25:26,253 --> 00:25:28,528
- Hey. Oh!
- Oh, God!

395
00:25:28,733 --> 00:25:30,451
Tru, you have a really hard head.

396
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:33,213
Thank you. I mean, I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

397
00:25:33,413 --> 00:25:36,564
No, it's fine, I think. I thought
you were gonna get drinks.

398
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:41,121
I totally forgot. Um, would you mind
getting them for us?

399
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:45,246
Look, I know this is weird, but
kind of fun, in a weird way, right?

400
00:25:45,853 --> 00:25:47,809
- Not really, but...
- Five minutes.

401
00:25:47,973 --> 00:25:51,170
I need five minutes to talk to Megan,
and then we'll go get dinner. My treat.

402
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:54,325
Okay. I'm just gonna go
rinse the blood off my teeth.

403
00:25:54,493 --> 00:25:56,768
- Fantastic idea.
- All right.

405
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:03,327
We gotta get going. I gotta tell
Kevin you're onboard tonight.

406
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:05,165
Oh, hey, look, about tonight.

407
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:07,247
Skip it.

408
00:26:07,453 --> 00:26:09,091
- What're you talking about?
- Skip it.

409
00:26:09,293 --> 00:26:12,171
We're gonna make, like, $300
in, like, half an hour.

410
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:14,728
Yeah. Or get nailed.

411
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:17,446
You just spent the day...

412
00:26:17,613 --> 00:26:21,731
...telling me half the guys we grew up
with are locked up. They're in jail.

413
00:26:21,893 --> 00:26:26,648
Billy, you have used up
about 10 of your nine lives.

414
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:28,611
You can't be lucky forever.

415
00:26:29,213 --> 00:26:32,410
One day things are gonna go sour.
I just don't want it to be tonight.

416
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:33,972
- Right?
- So wait up.

417
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,691
Is that why you came by today?

418
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:37,451
To tell me to stop doing jobs?

419
00:26:37,653 --> 00:26:40,406
I don't see you for three months
and suddenly you're my parole officer?

420
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:42,729
I'm just saying,
you don't have to do it tonight.

421
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:46,249
What? You want me to call my daddy,
like you? Maybe he can give me a job?

422
00:26:46,413 --> 00:26:47,528
Here's the problem.

423
00:26:47,693 --> 00:26:50,924
My daddy lives on a bench right
across from the bus depot, right?

424
00:26:51,093 --> 00:26:54,688
Last time I saw him, he asked me for
a quarter. Didn't even know who I was.

425
00:26:54,893 --> 00:26:56,292
We gotta do this less often.

426
00:26:56,453 --> 00:26:58,762
- Hey, I'm trying to do you a favor, man.
- Step off.

427
00:26:58,933 --> 00:27:01,811
I'm sorry about your father.
But take it from a friend.

428
00:27:02,013 --> 00:27:04,368
Life, it doesn't hand you
too many second chances.

429
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:07,923
Now, you just got one.
Now, trust me on this, Billy.

430
00:27:09,613 --> 00:27:12,446
Okay? Stay home.

431
00:27:13,813 --> 00:27:16,088
I'll take it under advisement.

432
00:27:33,253 --> 00:27:34,447
So...

433
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:37,173
...what's up with you and Jack, huh?
Love or hate?

434
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:39,369
I wish it were that easy.

435
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:42,286
But the two of you seem
to be hitting it off, though.

436
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:44,688
- Have you known him long?
- Just met him today.

437
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:47,487
Oh. It's funny how things
can change in a day, huh?

438
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,042
Oh, just so you know, Jack and I
are not together. We never have been.

439
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,090
So he's fair game if you're interested.

440
00:27:54,493 --> 00:27:56,245
I'm not really thinking long-term.

441
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,289
Yeah, sometimes it's more fun not to.

442
00:28:01,733 --> 00:28:04,406
Last year I had someone
I was real close to...

443
00:28:04,933 --> 00:28:08,448
...and it took off fast
and heavy, and then, uh...

444
00:28:08,893 --> 00:28:11,453
Well, and then he died.

445
00:28:12,453 --> 00:28:14,045
Oh, I'm so sorry.

446
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:17,885
I was so angry when Luc died.

447
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:22,648
I couldn't breathe.

448
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:26,812
After a while, I realized
how lucky I was...

449
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,969
...for the time I had with him.

450
00:28:32,173 --> 00:28:34,084
And then the craziest thing happened.

451
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:35,928
What?

452
00:28:37,773 --> 00:28:39,764
I had a great day.

453
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:44,483
Right when I thought
that I never would again.

454
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:50,169
Sometimes good stuff happens
out of the blue too.

455
00:28:52,453 --> 00:28:56,128
So apparently Jack told you I'm dying,
I have a life insurance policy...

456
00:28:56,293 --> 00:28:58,568
...and I don't plan on being
around for Christmas.

457
00:28:58,733 --> 00:29:01,201
Look, I'm not trying to question
your motives.

458
00:29:01,373 --> 00:29:04,126
I can't even begin to imagine
what you're dealing with.

459
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:07,325
But what if there was another
way to get that money?

460
00:29:07,933 --> 00:29:09,366
A hundred thousand dollars?

461
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:12,252
Unless you're a bank robber,
I'd say you're crazy.

462
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:13,772
What if I could?

463
00:29:14,413 --> 00:29:16,802
It's not just about the money.

464
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:19,571
I know.

465
00:29:20,453 --> 00:29:22,489
But you had a great day.

466
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:27,885
I mean, you could set
your Plan B in effect any time.

467
00:29:28,093 --> 00:29:31,085
Tomorrow or next week or next month.

468
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:34,046
It doesn't have to end tonight.

469
00:29:36,293 --> 00:29:37,931
How you doing?

470
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,569
Better and better.

471
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:49,008
Anyways, guys, it was so great
to see you, but I've gotta go.

472
00:29:50,213 --> 00:29:54,445
- Right now?
- Yeah. Just think about what I said.

473
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,761
Here.

474
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:05,406
- Where you going?
- To the Coogan fight.

475
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:09,452
Oh, you're ditching jazz to go
watch boxing? Oh, I am in!

476
00:30:09,613 --> 00:30:11,410
Deal.

477
00:30:13,493 --> 00:30:15,609
<i>Coogan takes a hit. Then another.</i>

478
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,047
<i>Norm 's hands just keep coming.</i>

479
00:30:17,213 --> 00:30:21,092
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, this is not</i>
<i>the way it was supposed to go.</i>

480
00:30:23,853 --> 00:30:27,004
<i>And he goes down. Coogan is down.</i>

481
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:30,768
<i>It's all over. I tell you, folks...</i>

482
00:30:30,973 --> 00:30:32,247
Damn it.

483
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,210
<i>... somebody should've</i>
<i>seen this coming.</i>

484
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:37,171
<i>And it's official. Coogan is out.</i>

485
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:39,884
That's 50, 100.

486
00:30:41,933 --> 00:30:44,493
- Hi.
- Thank you.

487
00:30:46,013 --> 00:30:48,925
Okay, and that's $ 100,000?

488
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:50,932
I had a hunch.

489
00:30:51,093 --> 00:30:53,687
- Uh, it'll have to be a cashier's check.
- That's perfect.

490
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,612
Could you make it out to
Wendy and Megan Roberts, please?

491
00:30:56,773 --> 00:30:57,808
Okay.

492
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:01,285
Hey, you wanna see something
awesome? I just won $ 100.

493
00:31:01,493 --> 00:31:02,482
Wow, that's great!

494
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:05,929
Okay, miss, I just need you
to sign right here and here.

495
00:31:06,093 --> 00:31:08,209
I didn't know you made a bet.

496
00:31:08,373 --> 00:31:10,807
- Yeah, I did.
- How much did you win?

497
00:31:12,573 --> 00:31:15,645
- Um, a hundred bucks, like you.
- Nice.

498
00:31:15,813 --> 00:31:20,125
- You know, you can get that in cash.
- Yeah, I know, but it's for tax purposes.

499
00:31:20,293 --> 00:31:21,806
There you go.

500
00:31:22,613 --> 00:31:23,887
Thanks.

501
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:25,924
Think I should've gotten mine
in a check?

502
00:31:26,093 --> 00:31:28,482
- Oh, no, cash is so much more fun.
- Hmm.

503
00:31:32,053 --> 00:31:34,772
Hmm. These are fantastic.

504
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,729
Harrison, you just won us this case.

505
00:31:38,893 --> 00:31:40,884
I'm proud of you.

506
00:31:41,613 --> 00:31:42,887
Umm...

507
00:31:43,053 --> 00:31:47,012
- So, what's gonna happen to those guys?
- Jail, most likely.

508
00:31:47,333 --> 00:31:49,210
Great job, son.

509
00:31:49,413 --> 00:31:50,732
Right.

510
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:55,770
So how we doing on that list of yours?
We still got some time.

511
00:31:55,933 --> 00:31:57,207
I know.

512
00:31:57,373 --> 00:32:00,604
But right now, all I wanna do
is see my sister.

513
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:03,050
I hope she's still awake.

514
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:05,282
Wendy?

515
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:07,444
You're not gonna believe
what happened.

516
00:32:07,653 --> 00:32:10,929
Your friend Tru stopped by.
She just handed this to me.

517
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:15,291
Some story about a special charity,
the Relive Your Day Foundation.

518
00:32:15,773 --> 00:32:17,206
I mean, is this for real?

519
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:18,802
Apparently.

520
00:32:18,973 --> 00:32:22,602
Do you have any idea what this means?
The best doctors, the best treatment.

521
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:25,651
- And that trip to Greece you wanted.
- Number 10 on my list!

522
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:28,088
Well, we're going!

523
00:32:29,293 --> 00:32:31,761
- I love you so much.
- Me too.

524
00:32:37,333 --> 00:32:38,925
Today was...

525
00:32:39,093 --> 00:32:41,766
How do I put this?
I know, it was bizarre.

526
00:32:41,933 --> 00:32:45,767
I know. I'm sorry. Sometimes
my life can be a little weird.

527
00:32:45,933 --> 00:32:47,651
Yeah, I noticed.

528
00:32:47,853 --> 00:32:50,208
- But having you there made it better.
- Better?

529
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:51,886
- Like, almost fun.
- Almost fun?

531
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:55,609
Wow. That is a ringing endorsement.
"Almost fun." Nice.

532
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:57,126
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah.

533
00:32:57,293 --> 00:33:03,528
Sometimes I can just go to dinner and
see a movie and be very, very normal.

534
00:33:06,853 --> 00:33:09,367
I think maybe normal's overrated.

535
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:23,805
So...

536
00:33:23,973 --> 00:33:25,929
...one weird day, huh?

537
00:33:26,093 --> 00:33:27,890
You have no idea.

538
00:33:29,053 --> 00:33:31,521
- We had a long talk, you know.
- You and your sister?

539
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:33,771
Me and Tru.

540
00:33:34,453 --> 00:33:36,921
She made me think about
a lot of stuff.

541
00:33:37,533 --> 00:33:39,649
I think maybe I've been pretty selfish.

542
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:43,411
- Stupid.
- How so?

543
00:33:43,573 --> 00:33:44,972
Well...

544
00:33:45,133 --> 00:33:48,250
...I tried to make it all about
the money...

545
00:33:48,413 --> 00:33:51,291
...but now that we have it,
time seems more important.

546
00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:53,529
I thought you didn't want
machines and tubes.

547
00:33:53,693 --> 00:33:55,126
I don't.

548
00:33:55,693 --> 00:33:58,651
But like Tru said, I can
always go to Plan B later.

549
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:04,523
If I've got just
a few more good days...

550
00:34:05,693 --> 00:34:07,445
...with you...

551
00:34:15,613 --> 00:34:18,332
...then I don't wanna miss
any of them.

552
00:34:20,813 --> 00:34:24,488
I was gonna sort of take this
one-way trip tonight...

553
00:34:24,693 --> 00:34:27,366
...but now, if you're willing...

554
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,125
...maybe we could both go.

555
00:34:31,413 --> 00:34:34,723
When I was a little girl, my dad
worked at the Edison Tower.

556
00:34:34,933 --> 00:34:39,051
He would take me up to the observation
deck, point out at the horizon and say...

557
00:34:39,213 --> 00:34:42,410
...that everything I could possibly
dream of was just past that line.

558
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:46,172
He'd say, "Just picture it,
whatever your heart desires...

559
00:34:46,333 --> 00:34:49,006
...and it's out there
just waiting for you."

560
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:53,281
He died when I was 10...

561
00:34:53,453 --> 00:34:55,569
...but I've always gone back there...

562
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:57,451
...to look out over the city...

563
00:34:57,613 --> 00:35:00,571
...and dream about the things
that I want.

564
00:35:01,093 --> 00:35:05,291
If I look long enough,
I can usually see them.

565
00:35:07,773 --> 00:35:09,365
Go with me tonight, Jack.

566
00:35:10,413 --> 00:35:12,324
And what do you think we'll see?

567
00:35:14,093 --> 00:35:15,765
Another day.

568
00:35:19,933 --> 00:35:21,730
I'm gonna go get my coat.

569
00:35:38,813 --> 00:35:40,769
- <i>Hello.</i>
- She was gonna kill herself.

570
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:44,209
All she wanted from me was to help
her make it look like an accident.

571
00:35:44,373 --> 00:35:46,682
Congratulations. Easy day.

572
00:35:47,293 --> 00:35:50,410
- She changed her mind.
- That's not an option.

573
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:54,687
- I'm not gonna kill her.
- That's not an option either.

574
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,571
- You know the rules.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

575
00:35:56,733 --> 00:35:59,327
A body asks Tru for help,
and I make sure they stay dead.

576
00:35:59,493 --> 00:36:01,484
But I'm not the one who changed
the rules this time.

577
00:36:01,653 --> 00:36:04,292
So as far as I'm concerned,
it's dealer's choice.

578
00:36:04,493 --> 00:36:05,721
Jack.

579
00:36:05,893 --> 00:36:08,361
When fate gets messed with,
there are consequences.

580
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:10,962
<i>You ready to accept the responsibility</i>
<i>for those consequences?</i>

581
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:13,886
You have to be strong, Jack,
and you have to do your job.

582
00:36:16,613 --> 00:36:17,932
Come on.

583
00:36:18,093 --> 00:36:20,448
Let's make this a night to remember.

585
00:36:31,213 --> 00:36:35,001
Who secretly led the Rohirrim through
the mountain pass to Minas Tirith's aid?

586
00:36:35,173 --> 00:36:37,050
Okay, I know this.

587
00:36:37,213 --> 00:36:39,443
- Oh, no, it doesn't look like it.
- Uh...

588
00:36:39,613 --> 00:36:42,571
- Celebrimbor? No, that's not right.
- Oh, I got you.

589
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,007
It's Ghân-buri-Ghân.

591
00:36:46,053 --> 00:36:48,169
- You gotta take your punishment.
- All right.

594
00:36:51,493 --> 00:36:53,927
Saved by the bell.

595
00:36:55,573 --> 00:36:56,892
Hello?

596
00:36:57,093 --> 00:37:00,165
- Davis?
- No, it's Zoron. Of course it's Davis.

597
00:37:00,573 --> 00:37:02,643
I need your help.
Have you been drinking?

598
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:04,730
Uh...

599
00:37:04,893 --> 00:37:08,852
Just a little bit. I'm on a date with
Carrie, but I'm clear-headed, I swear.

600
00:37:09,013 --> 00:37:10,241
At your service, go ahead.

601
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:12,643
I've covered all the bases
with Megan and Jack.

602
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,646
But I wanna be at Edison Tower
to make sure nothing goes wrong.

603
00:37:15,853 --> 00:37:18,526
<i>Do you know how late</i>
<i>the observation deck stays open?</i>

604
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:24,484
The Edison Tower observation deck
stays open from 9 a.m. To midnight.

605
00:37:24,653 --> 00:37:27,850
Okay, I'm gonna be a bit late to work.
I'm gonna stay till they close.

606
00:37:28,053 --> 00:37:29,088
You go, girl.

607
00:37:29,253 --> 00:37:32,723
Thanks, D. Take it easy on
the Bartles and Jaymes, okay?

608
00:37:32,893 --> 00:37:34,121
Okay. Bye-bye.

609
00:37:36,613 --> 00:37:39,446
I have to go to the little girls' room.

610
00:37:39,653 --> 00:37:41,245
Okay.

611
00:37:51,213 --> 00:37:52,487
<i>Yeah.</i>

612
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:55,167
Tru's headed to Edison Tower.
She wants to get there before you.

613
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,563
Got it. Thanks.

614
00:37:58,773 --> 00:38:01,003
- Bad news?
- Work.

615
00:38:01,173 --> 00:38:02,447
Scheduling thing.

616
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:05,446
- They always call this late?
- We never sleep.

617
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:10,451
- Well, I am glad you took the day off.
- Yeah. Me too.

618
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:14,003
Otherwise today would've turned out
very differently.

619
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,287
I'll tell you a secret. I, uh...

620
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:20,250
- I hate my job.
- Aw.

621
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:24,084
- Then why not quit?
- I'm not sure I'm strong enough.

622
00:38:24,253 --> 00:38:25,527
Oh.

623
00:38:25,693 --> 00:38:28,890
So you take some time off
and figure it out.

624
00:38:29,053 --> 00:38:32,250
- It's not the end of the world.
- I hope not.

625
00:38:32,453 --> 00:38:37,208
Well, you know, you've never told me
exactly what it is that you do.

626
00:38:37,493 --> 00:38:39,051
I help people.

627
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:43,411
Although most of the time they don't
realize I am helping them, but I am.

628
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:47,088
I try to make sure their lives
go according to plan.

629
00:38:47,413 --> 00:38:49,881
- Like a counselor?
- Yeah.

630
00:38:50,053 --> 00:38:52,009
Sort of like that.

631
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,210
Helping people.

632
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:57,092
It doesn't sound so bad to me.

633
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:14,484
You know what we should do?
We should close our eyes...

634
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:17,850
...spin around, point a finger and
whatever direction it is, we go.

635
00:39:18,013 --> 00:39:20,891
Car, boat, train, I don't care.
First thing in the morning.

636
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:22,281
That would be great.

638
00:39:23,933 --> 00:39:26,049
It's funny.

639
00:39:26,213 --> 00:39:29,125
I feel like I've been given
a second chance.

640
00:39:31,173 --> 00:39:34,927
- You know that feeling?
- Yeah, I do.

641
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:37,607
Hey, Megan, um...

642
00:39:40,613 --> 00:39:42,410
Your list.

643
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:47,643
You should keep it now.

644
00:40:00,253 --> 00:40:02,289
- Megan, I'm sorry.
- I got it.

645
00:40:02,493 --> 00:40:04,085
- No, wait a sec.
- Hey.

646
00:40:04,533 --> 00:40:06,046
It's my list.

647
00:40:07,293 --> 00:40:09,807
Megan, wait. Megan!

648
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:12,289
Ah! Jack!

650
00:40:14,053 --> 00:40:17,329
- Jack!
- I got you. I got you.

651
00:40:17,533 --> 00:40:19,444
Help me! Jack.

652
00:40:19,653 --> 00:40:21,450
Look up there!

653
00:40:26,293 --> 00:40:27,931
Jack, help me!

655
00:40:29,613 --> 00:40:30,932
Jack!

656
00:40:31,453 --> 00:40:32,568
Jack, help me.

657
00:40:32,853 --> 00:40:36,243
Pull me up. Please, Jack!

658
00:40:36,693 --> 00:40:37,682
Please.

659
00:40:44,173 --> 00:40:46,164
- I can't.
- Ah!

660
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:50,971
I can't. I'm not strong enough.

661
00:40:52,453 --> 00:40:53,602
Jack!

662
00:40:56,293 --> 00:40:58,602
Jack! Please!

663
00:40:59,693 --> 00:41:03,402
- Help me!
- I'm sorry. So sorry.

664
00:41:03,613 --> 00:41:05,285
Jack.

665
00:41:05,453 --> 00:41:06,681
Just hold on, man!

666
00:41:08,933 --> 00:41:10,924
- Jack!
- Somebody call 911!

669
00:41:18,413 --> 00:41:19,892
- She fell!
- She got too close.

670
00:41:20,053 --> 00:41:23,170
- It was some sort of crazy accident.
- Oh, no!

671
00:41:28,733 --> 00:41:31,247
I wish it were you.

672
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:35,053
That makes two of us.
