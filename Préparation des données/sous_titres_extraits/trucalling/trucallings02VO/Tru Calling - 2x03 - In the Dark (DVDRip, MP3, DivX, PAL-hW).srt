1
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,810
Coming.

3
00:00:21,653 --> 00:00:23,245
- Happy birthday!
- What?

4
00:00:23,413 --> 00:00:25,051
Happy birthday!

5
00:00:25,213 --> 00:00:29,650
- I'm sorry, I still can't quite...
- You heard me. Two's all you get.

6
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:33,362
I know how you love your birthday and
all, but I got some things to do today.

7
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,411
Oh, and your gift, in the works.
Not here yet.

8
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:38,689
And Dad, he's in Omaha,
and he sends his love.

9
00:00:38,853 --> 00:00:41,447
No, he doesn't. He forgot again.
But thank you for lying.

10
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:44,043
What are all these things
you have to do today?

11
00:00:44,213 --> 00:00:46,044
When Dad's out of town
you get a day off.

12
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:47,851
Yeah, but not today. Check it out.

13
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:51,085
He wants me to talk to a guy
who might have seen something...

14
00:00:51,253 --> 00:00:55,246
...about someone that could help out
a guy. I don't know, it's pretty big stuff.

15
00:00:55,693 --> 00:00:58,412
Hey, so, what's the plan
for the festive B-day?

16
00:00:58,573 --> 00:01:02,168
Well, I figure I'm a 23-year-old
with a mystical gift and a credit card...

17
00:01:02,333 --> 00:01:04,608
...so I'm gonna treat myself
to something special.

18
00:01:05,053 --> 00:01:09,171
Maybe some hot dogs?
It's looking a little thin in here, Tru.

19
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:12,006
There's this jade necklace
that's been calling my name...

20
00:01:12,173 --> 00:01:14,607
...which is much less creepy
than what usually calls my name.

21
00:01:14,773 --> 00:01:18,163
Ha! Yeah, jewelry. Mmm.

22
00:01:18,333 --> 00:01:21,564
You women think us guys
notice stuff like that. We don't.

23
00:01:21,773 --> 00:01:24,526
Other guys notice jewelry.
You just don't.

24
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:27,693
You know what? It's time
for me to get this day started.

25
00:01:27,853 --> 00:01:29,445
Hey, push.

26
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:33,083
You know what? I'm taking these.

27
00:01:46,453 --> 00:01:48,683
- Hey, Avery.
- Hey, Tru.

28
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:51,731
- Hello, Mr. Gorenstein.
- Happy birthday.

29
00:01:51,893 --> 00:01:53,565
I love that necklace. Is that new?

30
00:01:53,733 --> 00:01:57,203
Why, yes, it is. A little treat
from me to me. I'm glad you noticed.

31
00:01:57,373 --> 00:02:00,922
I did. But the guys won't.
They never notice that stuff.

32
00:02:01,133 --> 00:02:04,170
And besides, everybody's all distracted
by the engagement.

33
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:07,211
- What? Who's engaged?
- Jensen and Lexi.

34
00:02:07,373 --> 00:02:10,888
Lexi. I heard him mention her,
but I didn't know they were that serious.

35
00:02:11,053 --> 00:02:13,692
Well, it was all very impulsive.

36
00:02:14,653 --> 00:02:16,291
Tyler's in love with love.

37
00:02:16,493 --> 00:02:19,087
His diary is going to be full tonight.

38
00:02:19,693 --> 00:02:21,206
Hey!

39
00:02:21,373 --> 00:02:24,046
Hey, congratulations.
She's getting a great guy.

40
00:02:24,213 --> 00:02:26,363
- Thanks.
- She is. I hope she knows it.

41
00:02:26,533 --> 00:02:29,366
She's very excited. I didn't know
everybody else was excited.

42
00:02:29,533 --> 00:02:30,807
Living vicariously.

43
00:02:30,973 --> 00:02:33,089
Exactly.
None of us have anything going on.

44
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:36,245
I can't even remember the last time
I saw a guy naked.

45
00:02:37,413 --> 00:02:38,971
Okay.

46
00:02:47,813 --> 00:02:50,611
- Hey, nice necklace.
- Thank you.

47
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:56,371
Davis?

48
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:06,931
Davis?

50
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,405
Oh, my gosh!

51
00:03:13,573 --> 00:03:15,962
- Who put this all together?
- Harrison and I.

52
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:20,365
He was supposed to put a deposit down
on a nicer place, but that didn't pan out.

53
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,527
Well, there was a little hiccup
in the money situation.

54
00:03:23,693 --> 00:03:27,402
But look, this way I get to set up your
gift right here. Come, look. Come here.

55
00:03:27,573 --> 00:03:29,245
What...?

56
00:03:30,173 --> 00:03:32,687
Pinch yourself. It's not a dream.

57
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,812
Oh. It's a hot tub.

58
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,452
Yeah!

59
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:40,923
Look, now, don't get too excited.
It's only rented for one night.

60
00:03:41,093 --> 00:03:42,685
Davis, you let him bring this here?

61
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:44,607
I like the bubbles.

62
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:47,884
Just wait and see
how it rocks the party.

63
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:49,042
Okay.

64
00:03:49,213 --> 00:03:51,044
Need to get this thing up and running.

65
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:57,733
He tripped a circuit breaker.
I'll call Maintenance.

66
00:03:57,933 --> 00:03:59,525
Wait, don't bother, doc.

67
00:04:00,213 --> 00:04:02,807
- It's a lot nicer this way.
- Ambience.

68
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:04,565
- Tru!
- Hey!

69
00:04:04,733 --> 00:04:07,645
- Nice place.
- Yeah, it's morbid and strange...

70
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:10,043
...but we are happy to be here.
- Thank you.

71
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,090
Hey, come here,
I want you guys to meet.

72
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:17,048
This is my friend and boss, Davis. This is
Tyler and Avery from my anatomy class.

73
00:04:17,253 --> 00:04:19,130
Right. We talked to Davis
when he invited us.

74
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,608
Oh, yeah, right. It's nice to meet you.

75
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:24,452
Oh, and this is my little brother,
Harrison. Avery, Tyler.

76
00:04:25,413 --> 00:04:26,812
- Hi.
- Hi.

77
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:29,733
Harrison. That's a good name.
I like that.

78
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:35,685
- Thank you.
- Hey, did you guys see the hot tub?

79
00:04:35,893 --> 00:04:38,805
My brother has me confused
with the cast of <i>The Bachelor</i>.

80
00:04:38,973 --> 00:04:41,089
- I do now.
- I brought my swimsuit.

81
00:04:41,293 --> 00:04:44,968
- Where can we change?
- First takers. Right. Come with me.

82
00:04:46,693 --> 00:04:50,402
Davis, I love my party.
Thank you so much.

83
00:04:50,613 --> 00:04:53,730
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I got you a gift as well.

84
00:04:53,893 --> 00:04:55,804
- So let me go get it.
- Awesome.

85
00:04:55,973 --> 00:04:58,487
- Tru, hey, happy birthday.
- Hey.

86
00:04:58,653 --> 00:05:02,441
- I don't think that you've met Lexi.
- Lexi, at last. Best wishes.

87
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:04,763
Thank you.
It's all a whirlwind right now.

88
00:05:04,933 --> 00:05:07,447
You know, I'm just kind of waiting
for it to settle in.

89
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:10,730
I've never been in a morgue before.
This is absolutely fascinating.

90
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,612
There aren't any bodies here tonight,
but feel free to look.

91
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:17,083
Yeah? You wanna look around?
I swear you're gonna love this.

92
00:05:17,253 --> 00:05:20,848
Okay. Yeah. I just don't wanna look
at anything in a jar.

93
00:05:21,293 --> 00:05:23,249
- Have fun.
- Thanks, Tru.

94
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:26,567
Hi.

95
00:05:26,733 --> 00:05:29,372
I don't understand
how it looks so nice in the store.

96
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:32,491
- They put it in a box first.
- Oh. Maybe I should put it in a...

97
00:05:32,693 --> 00:05:34,888
No, don't you dare.

98
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,244
- It's hats.
- Yeah, it's two hats.

99
00:05:40,453 --> 00:05:42,523
You know the expression
"wearing two hats"?

100
00:05:42,693 --> 00:05:44,729
It symbolizes your two fields
of endeavor.

101
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:48,243
One for med school and one
for rewriting destiny here at the morgue.

102
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:52,411
Shoot. Carrie's here.

103
00:05:52,613 --> 00:05:56,049
Okay, this is getting a little ridiculous,
don't you think? Come here.

104
00:05:56,213 --> 00:05:58,044
- Hi, Carrie.
- Hi. Happy birthday.

105
00:05:58,213 --> 00:05:59,726
Thanks.

106
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:02,411
- Could you excuse me one sec?
- Sure.

107
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:06,532
- Hey, Davis. Ask her to stay.
- No, you ask her to stay.

108
00:06:06,693 --> 00:06:07,967
Davis!

109
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:12,490
Carrie, would you like to stay?

110
00:06:13,133 --> 00:06:14,612
I would love to.

111
00:06:15,053 --> 00:06:16,372
Great.

112
00:06:19,693 --> 00:06:23,527
- Hey, how's it going in there?
- I'm just embracing life.

113
00:06:24,773 --> 00:06:26,047
Is this safe?

114
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:28,932
- I cannot believe you'd do this!
- Tell him the truth.

115
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,885
- This is not your business!
- It is!

116
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:34,409
And if you won't tell him, then I will!
Let go of me!

117
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:37,087
- Everybody gather around.
- You have to tell him!

118
00:06:37,253 --> 00:06:39,130
It's cake time.

119
00:06:44,973 --> 00:06:46,247
Wow.

120
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:48,484
Happy birthday, Tru.

121
00:06:51,173 --> 00:06:53,129
- What's that?
- It's just a circuit breaker.

122
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:55,051
Hey, take advantage of it, people.

123
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:58,649
Nobody's gonna know who did what
when the lights come back on.

124
00:06:58,813 --> 00:07:00,212
Okay.

126
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:04,770
<i>Tru.</i>

127
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:08,166
- Harrison, is that you?
- What?

128
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:11,488
- Tru, what's going on?
- <i>Help me</i>.

129
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:26,851
Not what I wished for.

130
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,612
Help me.

131
00:08:03,693 --> 00:08:05,524
Don't settle in, Harry.
I'm heading out.

132
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,332
Something happened,
and I don't know who it happened to.

133
00:08:08,493 --> 00:08:11,087
I thought your birthday
was supposed to be giggles...

134
00:08:11,293 --> 00:08:15,002
...and love for the people of the Earth.
- Yeah, I had that birthday yesterday.

135
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:18,165
You had a replay on your birthday? Huh.

136
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,210
Is there anything I should do,
or not do?

137
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:23,212
Did I screw up?

138
00:08:23,533 --> 00:08:26,969
You threw me a party, which was
a really sweet thought, actually.

139
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,447
Give it up for the brother.

140
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:31,491
Just because you're my brother
doesn't mean you're the brother.

141
00:08:31,653 --> 00:08:34,087
And this time,
don't throw me a party at the morgue.

142
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:38,132
Especially with a rented hot tub, which
does not count as my gift, by the way.

143
00:08:38,573 --> 00:08:41,485
- Wait. I threw you a party at the morgue?
- It doesn't matter.

144
00:08:41,653 --> 00:08:44,531
Just cancel the whole thing.
It wouldn't be a surprise anymore.

145
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:46,411
Lock up when you leave?

146
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:50,406
- Hot dogs, bottom shelf.
- Thank you.

147
00:08:54,413 --> 00:08:56,529
So you couldn't tell anything
from the voice?

148
00:08:56,693 --> 00:08:59,730
It was a loud whisper.
It was, you know, harsh.

149
00:08:59,893 --> 00:09:01,884
But I couldn't tell
if it was a man or a woman.

150
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:04,283
It was dark.
You have no idea who asked for help?

151
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:07,331
There were no bodies for processing.
It wasn't you or Harrison.

152
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:09,688
- You guys were next to me.
- Then it was a guest.

153
00:09:09,853 --> 00:09:12,321
Great. Come for the cheese cubes,
stay for the death.

154
00:09:12,493 --> 00:09:15,451
- I am cursed. Am I like Typhoid Mary?
- Shh...

155
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:17,683
How many people
that I know am I gonna have to save?

156
00:09:17,853 --> 00:09:19,366
Maybe it wasn't someone you know.

157
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:22,252
Maybe it was someone who
came with someone you know.

158
00:09:22,413 --> 00:09:24,210
Aren't you a bundle of bright side.

159
00:09:24,373 --> 00:09:27,524
Okay, well, let's just think for a minute.
Who was there?

160
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:32,568
You mean here. You, me, Harrison,
Carrie, friends from school, Jensen...

161
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:34,007
Wait, Carrie was here?

162
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,925
She came by,
and you asked her to stay.

163
00:09:36,093 --> 00:09:38,846
- I did? Did she stay? Did she stay?
- You were masterful.

164
00:09:40,053 --> 00:09:41,611
Oh, God, I hope she's okay.

165
00:09:41,773 --> 00:09:45,163
I could never live with myself
if I was responsible for her being here.

166
00:09:45,373 --> 00:09:47,011
Davis, odds are she's fine.

167
00:09:47,173 --> 00:09:49,562
Let's just look at everyone
before we narrow it down.

168
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:51,371
All right, Tyler was in the hot tub.

169
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,482
And that was messing
with the electricity.

170
00:09:54,693 --> 00:09:56,649
So maybe it was him
or the maintenance guy.

171
00:09:57,493 --> 00:09:59,609
- Did you say hot tub?
- And it was really dark.

172
00:09:59,773 --> 00:10:01,889
So anyone could slip
by the rinse basin.

173
00:10:02,093 --> 00:10:04,653
- There was a hot tub?
- And before the lights went out...

174
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,724
...Avery was having a huge fight
with Lexi.

175
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,924
If you won't tell him, then I will!

176
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:11,404
- Okay, who's Lexi?
- Jensen's fiancée.

177
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:14,087
- Hey.
- I don't think that you've met Lexi.

178
00:10:14,413 --> 00:10:16,449
It looked like
it was gonna get violent.

179
00:10:16,653 --> 00:10:19,247
Lexi could've shoved her
or strangled her.

180
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:21,927
Avery was saying,
"If you don't tell him, I will."

181
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:23,765
I think she's the victim.

182
00:10:24,853 --> 00:10:28,129
It sounds like Lexi's got a secret,
and Avery knows about it.

183
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,249
I guess I'd better find out too.

184
00:10:34,413 --> 00:10:36,005
Harrison!

185
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,489
Look at you, man. You look great.

186
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:45,042
Robust. Like a man who's been
taking care of himself.

187
00:10:45,573 --> 00:10:49,486
So my continuing to be alive
isn't bothering you?

188
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:52,651
Oh, you mean because it runs counter
to the plan of the universe...

189
00:10:52,813 --> 00:10:56,488
...and every day you're setting in motion
consequences that can be damaging...

190
00:10:56,653 --> 00:10:59,725
...to the entire human race?
Now, why would that bother me?

191
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:02,004
Later, Jack.

192
00:11:02,173 --> 00:11:04,528
- Ass.
- Lucky Broad.

193
00:11:05,893 --> 00:11:10,171
Lucky Broad, Kentucky Rascal,
Better Off Sailing.

194
00:11:10,373 --> 00:11:11,852
Races five, six and seven.

195
00:11:12,013 --> 00:11:15,164
Oh, and Rascal's a long shot,
so bet big.

196
00:11:15,613 --> 00:11:19,003
What are you doing, man?
I haven't made a bet in months.

197
00:11:19,173 --> 00:11:22,848
Why not? There's no rule against
profiting from a rewind, Harrison.

198
00:11:23,013 --> 00:11:26,369
You know, Tru could make you
a millionaire if she wanted to.

199
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:29,531
It breaks my heart to see the way
that girl treats you.

200
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:32,486
That is so sweet. You remembered
those names just for me.

201
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,890
No, I remembered them for me.
Good deeds don't pay enough to live on.

202
00:11:36,053 --> 00:11:38,931
But hey, if you're not interested,
forget I said anything.

203
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:41,567
Already did, man. Already did.

204
00:11:51,853 --> 00:11:54,413
- Hey, Avery.
- Tru, happy birthday.

205
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:57,329
You must really like your birthday.

206
00:11:57,533 --> 00:11:59,683
I'm just glad to see you, that's all.

207
00:12:00,093 --> 00:12:01,845
So, what's with the commotion?

208
00:12:02,373 --> 00:12:05,206
You'll never believe it.
Jensen and Lexi got engaged.

209
00:12:05,653 --> 00:12:08,372
Really? Wow, I haven't met her.
What's she like?

210
00:12:08,613 --> 00:12:14,210
Uh, she's good. I mean, she's crazy
about him, so I guess that that's good.

211
00:12:14,413 --> 00:12:16,881
Huh. That was wishy
and at the same time washy.

212
00:12:17,093 --> 00:12:19,288
That's not like you.
You usually lay it all out.

213
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:21,728
I know. I love that about me.

214
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:26,085
Yeah, I don't know. I guess I like her
fine. It just all seems a little fast.

215
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:28,562
Oh. It's all terribly romantic.

216
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:33,009
- Morning.
- Jensen, congratulations.

217
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:35,733
I'm taking you guys out
for a congratulatory lunch.

218
00:12:35,893 --> 00:12:37,849
Right after lab over at Café Geneva.

219
00:12:38,013 --> 00:12:40,652
All of us, plus Lexi.
It'll be my chance to meet her.

220
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:44,641
That's amazingly generous of you, Tru.
I'll call Lex. I'm sure she'd love to come.

221
00:12:44,813 --> 00:12:46,769
Yeah, I'm in. I love their desserts.

222
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:50,050
I'm shaking hands with a small intestine.
Can we hold the food talk?

223
00:12:50,253 --> 00:12:54,041
- They have key lime pie.
- I do like key lime pie.

224
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,286
You sure it was our client
you dropped at the airport?

225
00:12:57,453 --> 00:12:59,683
Sure, I'm sure.
Look, he was late for a flight.

226
00:12:59,853 --> 00:13:03,243
He's talking to his girlfriend on
the cell phone. She's at the airport.

227
00:13:03,413 --> 00:13:06,211
So she's completely ticked off.
In fact, she's so angry...

228
00:13:06,373 --> 00:13:10,127
...he promised he'd fly her to the
Caribbean just because she's mad!

229
00:13:10,293 --> 00:13:12,523
Lucky broad
to find a sucker like that guy.

230
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:17,249
- Lucky Broad.
- Yeah.

231
00:13:17,413 --> 00:13:20,166
Anyway, I drive like a madman,
I get him there on time...

232
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,292
...he still doesn't give me a decent tip.
So yeah, I remember the guy.

233
00:13:25,533 --> 00:13:28,764
- Lucky Broad.
- Is that it?

234
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,412
Oh, yeah, that's it.

235
00:13:30,573 --> 00:13:34,452
- You don't want me to sign something?
- No. That was great. That was great.

236
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:38,607
No, lab's still going.
I'm just ducking into the hall.

237
00:13:38,773 --> 00:13:42,686
But the point is, I'm too soon. Whatever
Lexi's secret is, Avery doesn't know yet.

238
00:13:42,853 --> 00:13:47,563
I got Jensen to invite Lexi to a lunch
so I can work on her and watch them.

239
00:13:47,773 --> 00:13:49,684
<i>I'm hearing birds.</i>
<i>Where are you anyway?</i>

240
00:13:49,853 --> 00:13:52,447
I'm hiding behind a tree.
I'm watching Carrie buy coffee.

241
00:13:52,613 --> 00:13:54,843
- What? Davis, that's stalking.
- <i>No, it's not.</i>

242
00:13:55,013 --> 00:13:57,208
I wanna make sure
she's not in danger.

243
00:13:57,373 --> 00:13:58,647
<i>Davis, we have no reason...</i>

244
00:13:58,813 --> 00:14:00,804
...to believe that she's involved in this.

245
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,884
- Are you Carrie Allen?
- I'll call you back.

246
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:05,772
I'm Jack Harper. I worked
at the morgue with Tru and Davis.

247
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,730
They've said such nice things
about you.

248
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:10,453
- They're good people.
- That they are. That they are.

249
00:14:10,653 --> 00:14:13,087
I just wanted to say hi
and put a face with the name.

250
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:17,081
That was very nice of you to introduce
yourself. I'm sure I'll see you around.

251
00:14:24,893 --> 00:14:27,566
- Excuse me. What was that?
- Davis.

252
00:14:28,893 --> 00:14:31,453
I was just introducing myself.
I'm a friend of a friend.

253
00:14:31,613 --> 00:14:34,047
Stay away from Carrie.
Stay away from her, okay?

254
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:36,762
Do you have a personal stake
in this, Davis?

255
00:14:36,973 --> 00:14:41,410
Is this an affair of the heart?
That's adorable. It is.

256
00:14:42,453 --> 00:14:44,967
I would protect anyone
I saw you talking to.

257
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:48,927
Funny, I was talking to my landlady this
morning. I didn't see you lurking then.

258
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:55,172
I just hope you know
what you're getting into.

259
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:57,165
See you around, doc.

261
00:15:03,453 --> 00:15:05,523
Tru, everything has just changed.

262
00:15:13,853 --> 00:15:15,969
Do you not get it, Tru?
Jack is hanging around.

263
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:19,921
He's staying close to make sure she dies
again. You've gotta get to the morgue.

264
00:15:20,093 --> 00:15:23,210
I want to, but I can't right now.
I've gotta find out Lexi's secret.

265
00:15:23,373 --> 00:15:25,568
Handle Carrie yourself until I get back.

266
00:15:25,813 --> 00:15:29,408
Look, Carrie is gonna die
if we don't find out about her past.

267
00:15:30,093 --> 00:15:33,529
- What is the motive, who is the killer?
<i>- You're right, we should do that.</i>

268
00:15:33,693 --> 00:15:35,524
So here's an idea.
We could get Harrison.

269
00:15:35,693 --> 00:15:38,730
<i>He follows people for a living.</i>
<i>He watches her while you research.</i>

270
00:15:38,893 --> 00:15:40,406
Just hang on.

271
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:43,766
Can I get $2 to win on...?

273
00:15:48,053 --> 00:15:50,965
Bosses, huh?
They never seem to leave you alone.

274
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:56,644
I can't reach him.
He must be on assignment.

275
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:59,247
Listen, you gotta...
I just can't do this on my own.

276
00:15:59,453 --> 00:16:02,172
Yes, you can do this.
Look, just talk to her.

277
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,210
Find out if anyone
would have a motive.

278
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:06,290
- Look...
<i>- Avery was in danger at my party.</i>

279
00:16:06,493 --> 00:16:10,532
Lexi was furious. I've seen people look
like that. I've gotta stick with this.

280
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:12,923
Okay, just get here
as fast as you can, okay?

281
00:16:13,093 --> 00:16:14,446
Okay.

282
00:16:19,573 --> 00:16:23,532
This was such a great idea, Tru.
It's such a pleasure to meet you.

283
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:27,368
Yeah, you too. The engagement
was the perfect opportunity.

284
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:29,683
Jensen tells me
you're from right here in town?

285
00:16:29,853 --> 00:16:33,687
Yeah, I went to high school
at Adams High just down the street.

286
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:37,772
If those other girls could see me now,
huh? Engaged to a doctor.

287
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:40,887
- It's almost a cliché.
- I'm not a doctor yet.

288
00:16:41,093 --> 00:16:42,731
And so you work here in town too?

289
00:16:43,173 --> 00:16:45,971
I'm a receptionist
at a little insurance company.

290
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:48,772
But I'll probably quit now.

291
00:16:49,493 --> 00:16:51,802
- Champagne!
- None for me.

292
00:16:51,973 --> 00:16:54,362
I'm volunteering at the clinic later.

293
00:16:54,573 --> 00:16:58,771
- You probably shouldn't.
- Yeah, no champagne for me either.

294
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:01,885
- Thank you.
- No champagne, Lexi? Are you pregnant?

295
00:17:02,093 --> 00:17:06,928
- Avery.
- Oh. I'm sorry. I do that a lot.

296
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:11,086
I just kind of say things. I didn't mean
to sound blunt or anything.

297
00:17:11,253 --> 00:17:13,926
But seriously,
are you like an alcoholic or...?

298
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:18,924
- Should we say?
- Yeah.

299
00:17:19,093 --> 00:17:22,324
I mean, they're gonna find out
soon enough. So yeah, go ahead.

300
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:25,727
We are pregnant.

301
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:31,885
Wow, that's... Huh.

302
00:17:32,053 --> 00:17:33,452
I guess congratulations.

303
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:36,411
I didn't want you guys to think
that's the reason we're getting married.

304
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:39,804
No. But it is why I said yes, so...

305
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,405
At least she's an amazing girl.

306
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:45,484
I knew this was where
we were gonna end up.

307
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:47,689
Excuse me, guys.

308
00:17:52,573 --> 00:17:55,133
- What are you doing here?
- Look, they've got fondue.

309
00:17:55,293 --> 00:17:58,091
Do you ever have one of those days
when you just want fondue?

310
00:17:58,253 --> 00:17:59,811
Stay away from my friends.

311
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:03,050
Oh, yeah, I saw them in there.
I haven't met everybody yet.

312
00:18:03,213 --> 00:18:05,886
Would you like to introduce me? No?

313
00:18:06,373 --> 00:18:07,726
Okay.

314
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:12,530
This is some kind of birthday celebration,
isn't it? I almost forgot.

315
00:18:12,693 --> 00:18:16,527
I wanted to get you one with some sort
of death and resurrection imagery...

316
00:18:16,693 --> 00:18:20,925
...but they didn't have any. So I got you
a card with a picture of a cake on it.

317
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:25,649
I think it's time
for you to leave now.

318
00:18:25,853 --> 00:18:28,128
Tru, you don't want me
to meet your friends...

319
00:18:28,293 --> 00:18:31,968
...you don't want me to enjoy fondue.
Are you embarrassed by me?

320
00:18:32,373 --> 00:18:36,412
Because if you are, it would almost
be enough to hurt my feelings.

321
00:18:44,573 --> 00:18:46,245
Hi, Carrie.

322
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:48,608
How are you today? You look nice.

323
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,687
It occurs to me I don't know
a lot about your friends.

324
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:53,923
Like stringent enemies. Such a...

326
00:18:56,733 --> 00:19:00,169
Carrie, you're...
I like your blouse, blouse.

327
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,766
Oh, my God!

328
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:06,087
- Carrie, what's wrong?
- Nothing.

329
00:19:09,013 --> 00:19:12,369
I know we don't know each other
that well yet, but please just tell me.

330
00:19:14,853 --> 00:19:17,925
It was a situation that you
never think you'd find yourself in.

331
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:20,806
An abusive marriage
with a problem drinker.

332
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:26,605
But I just kept hoping
that things would get better.

333
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:29,604
I'm so sorry.

334
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:31,684
The thing that amazed me...

335
00:19:32,973 --> 00:19:35,692
...is how much I missed him...

336
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:38,925
...when he died.

337
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:45,683
- How did he die?
- He drowned.

338
00:19:47,133 --> 00:19:49,727
He passed out in a bathtub,
of all things.

339
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:54,484
The police came,
and they asked a lot of questions.

340
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:59,726
And I slowly started to realize that
they thought I was somehow involved.

341
00:20:00,613 --> 00:20:02,251
Involved?

342
00:20:03,093 --> 00:20:05,084
Yeah.

343
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:08,850
He took these thyroid pills,
and afterwards nobody could find them.

344
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:14,212
So somebody came up with this theory
that I had spiked the bottle...

345
00:20:14,973 --> 00:20:18,045
...with sedatives that I'd stolen
from the hospital where I worked.

346
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:20,852
What happened?

347
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:25,365
They never found the pills, so eventually
the police just dropped the investigation.

348
00:20:28,773 --> 00:20:31,287
But his sister still thought
that I did it.

349
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:37,927
I left the suburbs, and I came here.
And I thought that I was safe...

350
00:20:38,893 --> 00:20:40,611
...until today.

351
00:20:42,933 --> 00:20:46,130
"I know that you did it."
They both say the same thing.

352
00:20:48,253 --> 00:20:50,164
I found one of them this morning.

353
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,803
It was actually rolled up
into my newspaper on the front porch.

354
00:20:54,613 --> 00:20:57,889
And the other one I found
right before you came in.

355
00:21:00,453 --> 00:21:02,011
In my purse.

356
00:21:03,693 --> 00:21:06,765
I think that maybe that I can help you.

357
00:21:09,813 --> 00:21:12,373
<i>And Better Off Sailing</i>
<i>and Happy Clam are neck and neck.</i>

358
00:21:12,533 --> 00:21:14,125
<i>Lost Cause is closing in on them...</i>

359
00:21:14,293 --> 00:21:18,411
<i>... but it looks like Better Off Sailing may</i>
<i>pull this off, people! This is unbelievable!</i>

360
00:21:18,573 --> 00:21:22,327
- <i>It's down to the final stretch! Here is...</i>
- Whoa! Yes!

361
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,410
Yeah! Oh...

362
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:28,730
I didn't know. I did know.

363
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:40,565
Davis, you weren't here,
and I couldn't reach you.

364
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:43,850
Listen, Lexi's pregnant,
and that's why Jensen's marrying her.

365
00:21:44,013 --> 00:21:46,481
- And I think I know what the secret is.
- What?

366
00:21:46,693 --> 00:21:49,730
Lexi, she's marrying Jensen
to make her way up in the world.

367
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,562
What could Avery find out that would
derail everything for a pregnant bride?

368
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:56,850
Well, what if the baby isn't Jensen's?
I mean, it's classic.

369
00:21:57,013 --> 00:21:59,208
She would be determined
to keep that secret.

370
00:21:59,373 --> 00:22:01,329
No, I don't think that's what happened.

371
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,764
Avery's volunteering at the clinic
this afternoon. And it's a theory...

372
00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:08,608
...but I bet Lexi came in for an exam,
or Avery saw her medical records.

373
00:22:08,813 --> 00:22:10,132
She knows about the baby's father.

374
00:22:10,293 --> 00:22:11,931
- Tru...
- Anyway, I'm gonna go tag along...

375
00:22:12,093 --> 00:22:15,369
...as a new volunteer, and maybe
I can keep it from happening again.

376
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,852
- Tru!
- What?

377
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:19,607
Carrie's husband died,
and she's got a sister-in-law...

378
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:23,209
...out in Rockville who blames her.
And I think she killed her.

379
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:25,568
And Jack's around
to make sure it happens again.

380
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:28,725
Jack's been hanging around Avery too.
They can't both be victims.

381
00:22:28,893 --> 00:22:32,090
- So he's playing us.
- You assume that Carrie is the decoy?

382
00:22:32,253 --> 00:22:36,292
- It could've just as well been Avery.
- Let's not do this, Davis, please?

383
00:22:36,493 --> 00:22:40,202
I wish I could investigate both options,
I do. You're gonna have to handle this.

384
00:22:40,373 --> 00:22:42,841
Yeah, so you can run off
and be with your new friends.

385
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,764
- What?
- I just don't think you're being objective!

386
00:22:46,973 --> 00:22:49,123
What, and you are?

387
00:22:49,693 --> 00:22:53,572
I know you like her, and I know what
it's like to lose someone you care about.

388
00:22:53,733 --> 00:22:57,408
- But, Davis, you're just not being...
- No, Tru, you can't do this to me!

389
00:22:57,573 --> 00:22:59,962
You can't make this
about poor funny little Davis...

390
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:04,206
...who always loses it when a girl smiles
at him. This isn't funny. This is serious.

391
00:23:04,373 --> 00:23:07,046
And I've gotta go protect
this woman myself?

392
00:23:07,213 --> 00:23:09,932
And if she dies because you
weren't there to protect her...

393
00:23:10,093 --> 00:23:11,890
...I will never forgive you.

394
00:23:24,173 --> 00:23:26,004
So how long
have you volunteered here?

395
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:29,245
Years. It's something Jensen got me
into when we were both pre-med.

396
00:23:29,413 --> 00:23:32,723
- You've known each other a long time?
- Yeah, we used to...

397
00:23:32,893 --> 00:23:35,407
Well, we used to have
a lot of classes together.

398
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:38,167
- You used to go out?
- A long time ago.

399
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,449
- What happened?
- We just became best friends.

400
00:23:40,613 --> 00:23:42,922
It's really like 100 times
better this way.

401
00:23:43,093 --> 00:23:47,371
- You take care of him.
- Yeah. And he takes care of me.

402
00:23:47,533 --> 00:23:50,172
I mean, he would take care of me,
if I let him.

403
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:53,286
And that is my heart-to-heart limit
for one day, okay?

404
00:23:53,453 --> 00:23:55,250
You got it. So, what's that?

405
00:23:55,413 --> 00:23:57,847
This is the sign-in.
It's people with appointments.

406
00:23:59,213 --> 00:24:01,090
Are you looking for someone?

407
00:24:01,293 --> 00:24:04,012
I'm just trying to get a feel
for everything, that's all.

408
00:24:04,173 --> 00:24:07,165
There's a little filing today,
so we should probably start here.

409
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,971
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Uh...

410
00:24:09,213 --> 00:24:13,445
Looks like some records
just got sent over, so I gotta sort these.

411
00:24:13,613 --> 00:24:15,331
I could do that too.

412
00:24:15,493 --> 00:24:19,532
And spin plates and play the kazoo.
Take it easy, Tru, all right?

413
00:24:19,693 --> 00:24:22,605
You're a superstar,
but you do not need to save the world.

414
00:24:22,773 --> 00:24:25,287
I guess it just feels like that
sometimes.

415
00:24:26,773 --> 00:24:30,482
Well, Alexandra Keely. That's Lexi's
file, Avery. You shouldn't look at that.

416
00:24:30,653 --> 00:24:34,123
- I gotta go.
- No, wait, let's talk about this.

417
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:36,887
- You can't confront her.
- You don't know what's going on.

418
00:24:37,053 --> 00:24:39,123
- Assume I do.
- Jensen's being lied to.

419
00:24:39,293 --> 00:24:41,932
I know you wanna protect him,
but there's a better way.

420
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:44,283
- Let's talk to him together.
- Excuse me.

421
00:24:44,453 --> 00:24:47,650
- Do you know if there's a sign-in sheet?
- Yeah. Over there. Excuse me.

422
00:24:57,413 --> 00:24:59,085
Oh.

423
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:02,889
Davis, I found out why Lexi may have
wanted to kill Avery. The secret...

424
00:25:03,093 --> 00:25:05,482
<i>... is that there is no baby.</i>

425
00:25:05,653 --> 00:25:08,042
I saw her medical records.
She had a uterine myoma...

426
00:25:08,213 --> 00:25:10,124
...and got a hysterectomy
two years ago.

427
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:12,483
- So she can't be pregnant.
- <i>It was a scam...</i>

428
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:16,089
...to get Jensen to marry her. No wonder
Lexi didn't want that to get out.

429
00:25:16,253 --> 00:25:17,732
What, so you have a new theory?

430
00:25:17,893 --> 00:25:20,088
You'll consider every point of view
except mine.

431
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:23,086
I'm not trying to ignore you.
I'm trying to prevent a death.

432
00:25:23,253 --> 00:25:26,370
Listen, I gotta go, Tru. I have
an appointment with the real killer.

433
00:25:36,573 --> 00:25:39,770
Thank you for the tea. It's very hot.

434
00:25:40,293 --> 00:25:43,410
I'd do anything for the man
who's gonna reopen my brother's case.

435
00:25:43,613 --> 00:25:47,401
Well, we don't exactly reopen cases
at the morgue.

436
00:25:47,573 --> 00:25:49,962
We do like to educate ourselves
about what happened.

437
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:53,250
I understand that your brother
drowned in a bath?

438
00:25:53,973 --> 00:25:57,010
Well, that's what she told everyone,
but it isn't right.

439
00:25:57,173 --> 00:26:00,483
- It doesn't make sense.
- But he was a drinker, right?

440
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:04,481
Not so that he'd pass out in the tub.
And they never found that bottle of pills.

441
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:07,412
She destroyed it because
she knew they could link it to her.

442
00:26:07,573 --> 00:26:10,485
But surely a small prescription bottle
could be thrown away.

443
00:26:10,693 --> 00:26:13,730
No. She killed him.

444
00:26:16,093 --> 00:26:20,644
I'm sure that she'll be punished
by the universe, not by human hands...

445
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:24,886
...because that would be wrong.
- No, my brother was a good man.

446
00:26:25,053 --> 00:26:29,365
He never laid a hand on her,
and he never passed out in any bathtub.

447
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,601
And don't you tell me
about who dispenses justice.

448
00:26:32,813 --> 00:26:36,249
I know that no one does
because I know what she did.

449
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:47,848
- What's going on?
- You're not safe here. Come on.

450
00:26:50,413 --> 00:26:51,892
Come on in.

451
00:26:54,093 --> 00:26:57,972
I know it's not much,
but it has central air...

452
00:26:58,133 --> 00:27:01,170
...which is good because the morgue,
when the AC breaks down...

453
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,722
...sometimes we tend to walk around
naked and...

454
00:27:05,453 --> 00:27:08,968
- Huh. That's beautiful.
- Yeah.

455
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:12,765
I got these in Mexico.

456
00:27:12,933 --> 00:27:16,642
But you can't eat off them because
the glaze will cause severe brain damage.

457
00:27:16,813 --> 00:27:20,362
- Would you like a Fresca?
- No, thanks.

458
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,528
- I like your apartment.
- Yeah.

459
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:29,331
I feel so safe here. I'm embarrassed that
I showed you these in the first place.

460
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,807
It's probably just some neighbor kid
playing a joke.

461
00:27:34,973 --> 00:27:36,531
Yeah.

462
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:41,885
I don't think so. But you're safe here.
You're okay here.

463
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:44,846
I know.

464
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,284
She didn't even come back here
at all today?

465
00:27:51,453 --> 00:27:54,570
- Avery? No. But she called in.
- She did? Great.

466
00:27:54,733 --> 00:27:57,884
She said she was meeting up
with her friend Jensen and his fiancée.

467
00:27:58,253 --> 00:27:59,971
Where? Did she say where?

468
00:28:00,213 --> 00:28:03,330
Um... Standard Diner. Do you know it?

469
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:20,605
Surprise!

470
00:28:29,973 --> 00:28:33,249
I knew you thought I canceled it.
I wasn't sure you'd get the message.

471
00:28:33,413 --> 00:28:36,246
- I didn't.
- Well, you're here, so obviously...

472
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:37,971
Did you see Avery?

473
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,091
- Which one's Avery?
- Never mind.

474
00:28:41,613 --> 00:28:43,205
Excuse me.

475
00:28:45,213 --> 00:28:47,488
"Thank you, Harrison.
What a lovely surprise."

476
00:28:47,653 --> 00:28:49,211
You're welcome, Tru.

477
00:28:51,853 --> 00:28:55,641
- Hey, happy birthday again.
- Thanks. Have you seen Avery?

478
00:28:55,853 --> 00:28:58,526
- I don't think Avery's here yet.
- Where's Lexi?

479
00:28:58,773 --> 00:29:01,492
Uh, the bathroom, I think.
I don't know. Why, what's up?

480
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:05,807
Look, I don't wanna say this, but
there's something I have to tell you...

481
00:29:05,973 --> 00:29:07,645
...and it's not...
- Tru?

482
00:29:07,813 --> 00:29:09,087
I was at the clinic today...

483
00:29:09,253 --> 00:29:11,767
...and Lexi's records were there.
- I moved them there.

484
00:29:11,933 --> 00:29:15,448
I thought with the baby it'd be good to
have the best care. What is this about?

485
00:29:15,613 --> 00:29:18,730
I saw the records, and there's something
she's not telling you.

486
00:29:18,893 --> 00:29:23,125
- You saw the records?
- Yeah, I was there with Avery.

487
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:26,370
No, I don't care. I don't wanna know.
Whatever you saw is private.

488
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:30,208
- Lf she wants to, she'll tell me about it.
- Jensen, she isn't pregnant.

489
00:29:33,613 --> 00:29:36,286
- What?
- She had a uterine myoma.

490
00:29:36,453 --> 00:29:40,048
They performed a hysterectomy.
You needed to know.

491
00:29:45,053 --> 00:29:47,123
Thank you for deciding
what it is that I need.

492
00:29:47,293 --> 00:29:49,727
She's playing you.
She just wants to marry a doctor...

493
00:29:49,893 --> 00:29:53,852
...and things are about to get bad.
- Loving the cheese cubes.

494
00:29:54,013 --> 00:29:56,652
Hey, what's up with Jensen?

495
00:29:56,813 --> 00:29:58,565
Hmm. Bold.

496
00:29:59,613 --> 00:30:02,047
- I can't believe you'd do this!
- Tell him the truth.

497
00:30:02,373 --> 00:30:04,364
- This is none of your business.
- Yes, it is!

498
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:06,364
And if you're not gonna tell him,
then I will!

499
00:30:09,813 --> 00:30:12,202
Lexi, you have to tell him
that you're not pregnant.

500
00:30:12,373 --> 00:30:15,285
- Look, shut up.
- Now it's a party.

501
00:30:16,293 --> 00:30:18,568
Chick fight! Chick fight!
I love a chick fight!

502
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,689
I'm coming to your birthday
every year.

503
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:23,802
Ah, man, this is bad.

504
00:30:24,133 --> 00:30:26,693
Lexi, he's going to find out.

505
00:30:28,373 --> 00:30:30,091
I know.

506
00:30:31,493 --> 00:30:33,245
I know he will.

507
00:30:34,133 --> 00:30:36,124
When he does,
it's all gonna be ruined.

508
00:30:39,653 --> 00:30:42,531
Oh. This is even hotter
than a chick fight.

509
00:30:42,693 --> 00:30:46,368
But you see, the thing about this is,
Lexi is clearly alive...

510
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:50,845
...and an opportunist
and a big no-uterus-having crybaby...

511
00:30:51,013 --> 00:30:53,322
...but I really don't think she's a killer.

512
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:56,732
Happy birthday.

513
00:30:57,253 --> 00:30:59,084
Harrison!
This was a great party, man.

514
00:30:59,253 --> 00:31:01,448
I knew you'd do the right thing
with that money.

515
00:31:01,613 --> 00:31:03,763
You know, getting everybody here.

516
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:14,167
Jack gave me the names
of these horses, and I won...

517
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,483
...and I used the money for the party.

518
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,244
But I think
that he wanted you here so...

519
00:31:19,413 --> 00:31:20,766
Instead of somewhere else.

520
00:31:23,053 --> 00:31:25,692
But can you even build a canoe
out of concrete?

521
00:31:25,853 --> 00:31:28,321
Yeah, of course.
With the correct engineering you can.

522
00:31:28,493 --> 00:31:32,281
That's how I met my wife actually,
at one of those races.

523
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:38,005
Her team won, and then her team
dumped my team in the water.

524
00:31:38,213 --> 00:31:41,330
I got a bacterial infection,
but I didn't mind.

525
00:31:42,093 --> 00:31:43,845
That's actually very sweet.

526
00:31:44,813 --> 00:31:46,963
It was a long time ago, though.

527
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:51,966
It doesn't hurt
to think about it anymore.

528
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:55,201
You know?
It'll be the same with you too.

530
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,449
You're already making it better.

532
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:26,892
Did you hear that?

533
00:32:27,893 --> 00:32:31,090
There's someone in the hallway.
Go hide in my room.

534
00:32:42,573 --> 00:32:45,565
Hey. Whoa! Davis, you were right.

535
00:32:45,773 --> 00:32:48,003
It's not Avery. It never was.
It's Carrie.

536
00:32:48,173 --> 00:32:51,609
And I am so, so sorry
I didn't listen to you. I really am.

537
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:54,571
- That's okay. You're here now.
- Is she here? Is she safe?

538
00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:56,644
Yeah, she's in the other room.
She's safe.

539
00:32:56,813 --> 00:32:59,646
Any more notes? Any other suspects
besides the sister-in-law?

540
00:32:59,813 --> 00:33:02,885
No more notes. I don't think
the sister-in-law would do it herself.

541
00:33:03,053 --> 00:33:05,521
I think she hired someone.
And the notes...

542
00:33:06,293 --> 00:33:08,761
...are clearly an attempt
at a blackmail gone bad.

543
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,887
I'm still not sure.

544
00:33:16,773 --> 00:33:19,526
Davis, stop.
You know who wrote these notes.

545
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:22,167
They were both decoys.
It wasn't Carrie or Avery.

546
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,325
The death is still on,
and it's happening in the morgue.

547
00:33:25,493 --> 00:33:27,768
But there's no one there.
How can it happen again?

548
00:33:27,933 --> 00:33:29,491
Because someone is there.

549
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:31,962
- And he was there on day one.
- Who?

550
00:33:32,133 --> 00:33:35,523
The lights didn't go out because
of the hot tub. The wiring is bad.

551
00:33:35,693 --> 00:33:38,048
And the maintenance man
is there right now.

552
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:42,167
No!

553
00:35:04,013 --> 00:35:05,969
It's frustrating, isn't it?

554
00:35:07,213 --> 00:35:09,773
- Jack.
- You could save him...

555
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:13,562
...if you could get to him.
I know you know CPR.

556
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:16,167
But those wires are live, Tru.

557
00:35:16,373 --> 00:35:18,011
Barbecue Tru.

558
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:22,405
You say you're on the side of good,
and yet you stand there enjoying this.

559
00:35:22,853 --> 00:35:24,525
You think I'm enjoying this, George?

560
00:35:25,493 --> 00:35:28,883
George isn't talking.
You knew that was his name, right?

561
00:35:29,493 --> 00:35:31,211
I don't think you did.

562
00:35:31,693 --> 00:35:33,524
But maybe that's a good thing.

563
00:35:33,693 --> 00:35:36,730
Maybe it's easier when it's someone
you don't know and care about.

564
00:35:38,573 --> 00:35:40,370
No, it isn't.

565
00:36:12,133 --> 00:36:15,170
I'm sorry it's a day late.
You don't have to act surprised.

566
00:36:16,853 --> 00:36:20,163
Did I tell you about the symbology?
Two hats, two jobs.

567
00:36:21,013 --> 00:36:23,573
- It seemed clever at the time.
- Yes.

568
00:36:24,293 --> 00:36:26,807
And it's a wonderful thought, Davis.

569
00:36:27,813 --> 00:36:31,169
But I'm starting to think
I can't handle med school and this.

570
00:36:31,973 --> 00:36:35,249
Tru, we were both wrong.

571
00:36:36,053 --> 00:36:40,285
It's just that now with Jack involved,
it's harder.

572
00:36:40,453 --> 00:36:42,762
He's good.

573
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:46,889
He's better than good.
He knows stuff.

574
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,483
Jack wasn't at the party
before the rewind...

575
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:51,928
...and yet he knew
about Lexi and Avery's fight.

576
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:54,448
And he knew enough
to make Carrie look likely too.

577
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,205
How does he know this stuff?

578
00:36:59,173 --> 00:37:01,050
Yeah, that's what I thought.

579
00:37:03,733 --> 00:37:05,769
Thanks for my hats anyway.

580
00:37:06,453 --> 00:37:10,162
You're welcome. Go on, get to school.
Prove you can do both.

581
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,808
- Avery, hi.
- Hey, good party last night.

582
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:26,727
I looked for you after my little blowup
with Lexi, but I couldn't find you.

583
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:30,721
- How's Jensen? Have you guys talked?
- Yeah. I think I'm forgiven.

584
00:37:30,893 --> 00:37:33,327
But you have to have
your own conversation with him...

585
00:37:33,493 --> 00:37:35,688
...because we both looked at her file.
- Right.

586
00:37:35,853 --> 00:37:37,923
Even though you did do
everything you could...

587
00:37:38,093 --> 00:37:40,209
...to keep me from looking
at anybody's file.

588
00:37:40,373 --> 00:37:42,841
There's no way I could've known
what was in there.

589
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:45,009
I know, but you did.

590
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:47,932
And when you miss class,
you know what we talked about.

591
00:37:48,093 --> 00:37:52,325
Like details and who asked
what questions. That kind of thing.

592
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:55,525
I didn't realize that. Weird.

593
00:37:55,693 --> 00:37:57,649
Yeah. It's cool.

594
00:37:58,373 --> 00:38:01,012
I just wanted you to know
that I noticed.

595
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:06,002
So go. Talk to Jensen.

596
00:38:06,413 --> 00:38:07,892
Okay.

597
00:38:33,653 --> 00:38:35,245
I'm sorry.

598
00:38:37,373 --> 00:38:39,125
It's fine.

599
00:38:39,333 --> 00:38:42,848
I told you about what was in someone
else's records. That's not fine.

600
00:38:43,013 --> 00:38:45,004
Lexi's the one that lied.

601
00:38:46,213 --> 00:38:48,807
She wanted to marry a doctor.
And she settled for me...

602
00:38:48,973 --> 00:38:52,602
...because I think I might be the last guy
in the country who marries a girl...

603
00:38:52,773 --> 00:38:56,732
...just because she gets pregnant.
- I like that you're that guy.

604
00:38:57,373 --> 00:39:00,524
I guess I'm happy that I found out
when I did, you know?

605
00:39:01,093 --> 00:39:02,685
You don't look happy.

606
00:39:04,053 --> 00:39:06,692
You look like you miss her.

607
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,492
No.

608
00:39:10,133 --> 00:39:12,693
No, I don't think that's it.
I think that...

609
00:39:15,933 --> 00:39:19,050
I think I miss the girl
that I was hoping she was.

610
00:39:20,693 --> 00:39:23,446
Witty, charming,
that cared about what it is that I did...

611
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:27,128
...but also had her own stuff.
You know, things that she cared about.

612
00:39:27,293 --> 00:39:29,090
Friends that she cared about.

613
00:39:29,573 --> 00:39:31,962
You'll find that person.
We all have to believe...

614
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,522
...that there's someone
out there that...

615
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:38,332
The right person for us.

616
00:39:40,173 --> 00:39:41,925
Sure.

617
00:39:43,653 --> 00:39:46,292
There's the right person for everybody.

618
00:39:53,213 --> 00:39:55,488
Okay. Well, as soon as I get that...

619
00:39:59,893 --> 00:40:02,851
- Hey, you're leaving?
- No, I can talk for a minute.

620
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:08,366
Um, I wanted to thank you for last night.
I was really glad that you were there.

621
00:40:09,093 --> 00:40:11,687
I was scared,
and you made me feel safe.

622
00:40:12,653 --> 00:40:14,325
And that's a good thing.

623
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:22,806
About the kissing?

624
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:27,768
- I felt like I was crossing a line there.
- Davis, that was a good thing too.

625
00:40:28,693 --> 00:40:31,127
- Really?
- Yes.

626
00:40:31,293 --> 00:40:32,282
Oh.

627
00:40:32,453 --> 00:40:35,604
- I'm sorry, I have to run.
- No. Yeah. No problem.

628
00:40:35,813 --> 00:40:37,531
Okay.

629
00:40:41,173 --> 00:40:45,007
You should know that I thank whatever
force in the universe brought me to you.

632
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:15,812
I like this place. It is a lot better
than the dive where we first met.

633
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:20,649
Anything is better than that place.
Stale peanuts and watered-down liquor.

634
00:41:21,333 --> 00:41:23,893
- I got you a beer.
- Thank you.

635
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:27,611
- Long day yesterday?
- About 40 hours.

636
00:41:27,773 --> 00:41:30,845
But it was easy.
All I had to do was a little misdirection.

637
00:41:31,013 --> 00:41:33,322
- How about you?
- Not bad.

638
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:35,848
I got to know Davis a little better.

639
00:41:36,013 --> 00:41:38,652
- A funny little man.
- And?

640
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:42,811
And he believes every word that I say.
