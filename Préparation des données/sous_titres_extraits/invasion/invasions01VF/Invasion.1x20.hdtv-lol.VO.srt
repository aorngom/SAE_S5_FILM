1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,200
i know that there's an invasive species
that's entered the glades...

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,100
and now is the time
for us to rise up!

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,500
and i'll do anything
 to protect my family.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,500
who can tell me
what this word means?

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,900
she's
a very special girl, sir.

6
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,800
yes, she is.
she's also a very young one.

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,000
hey, deputy. if you can hear me,
raise your hand.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:21,900
oh, my god.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,900
the lights came in
during the hurricane, right?

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,500
so wouldn't it stand to reason
if you were a hybrid psychopath

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,900
planning an invasion,
  you might do it under the cover of a storm?

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,100
szura's gone, russell.

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,500
i don't know
 what he's planning.

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,500
but i'm gonna need your help
to stop him.

15
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,400
thank you, miss.

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,100
you're welcome.

17
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,100
it's nice to know
if i get in trouble again,

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,600
you're always nearby.

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,200
<i>that's right, paul.</i>

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,900
<i>winds are moving northwest</i>
<i>at 12 miles per hour,</i>

21
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:50,400
<i>and accutrack is predicting</i>
<i>that miranda</i>

22
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,000
<i>could make landfall as early</i>
 <i>as 8:00 tomorrow night.</i>

23
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,500
<i>well, larkin,</i>
   <i>we're hearing up here</i>

24
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,100
<i>that some residents</i>
  <i>of west palm beach</i>

25
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,300
<i>are already evacuating.</i>

26
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,800
<i>that's</i>
 <i>my understanding, as well,</i>

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,800
<i>but even though</i>
 <i>the national weather service</i>

28
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,400
<i>is saying that</i>
 <i>we'll all be safe down here,</i>

29
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,900
<i>i would caution</i>
 <i>all homestead residents</i>

30
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,600
<i>to be prepared</i>
 <i>for anything.</i>

31
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,200
<i>well, certainly,</i>
 <i>better safe than sorry,</i>

32
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,700
<i>but right now, i think</i>
  <i>we can all be grateful</i>

33
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:13,100
<i>that this time it looks</i>
   <i>like we dodged a bullet.</i>

34
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:14,400
<i>that's definitely</i>
 <i>one way of looking at it.</i>

35
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,100
<i>thanks, paul.</i>
  <i>back to you.</i>

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,500
i brought you a doughnut.

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,200
 i'm not hungry.

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,500
i thought all policemen
  liked doughnuts.

39
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,900
i'm not a policeman.
you left the island.

40
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,600
yeah, it was getting
 a lile crowded--

41
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,800
coast guard, park rangers.

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
 where is everybody?
safe.

43
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:00,300
 where?

44
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
i don't think i like
  your tone, tom.

45
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,000
and i don't like the fact

46
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,200
that i sent you people to
  look after, and they're dead.

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,100
you know,
when we first got together,

48
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,700
you promised me the freedom
to do what i needed to do,

49
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:11,500
and now all you do
is second-guess me.

50
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,700
i don't trust you
 anymore, eli.

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
that's clear.

52
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,700
 and you shouldn't trust me.

53
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,100
you can't keep me in here.

54
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,600
maybe not forever,

55
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,000
but long enough to find out
where you're hiding everyone.

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,100
i told you
  they're safe.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
no, they're not.

58
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,000
these people are a danger
  to themselves

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
and everyone around them.

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,100
nature will take care
  of them, tom.

61
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,900
nature takes care
  of everything.

62
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,700
have you seen the news?
there's a storm coming.

63
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,400
the experts said
it will land further north,

64
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,800
but we know different,
  don't we?

65
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,900
our people will be fine.

66
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,300
it's the rest of the town
you should be concerned with.

67
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,300
this hurricane is gonna
  make landfall <i>here,</i>

68
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,300
and no one's gonna be able
 to evacuate,

69
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,200
because all the roads
  heading north will be blocked.

70
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,400
for our protection,

71
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,000
to keep our citizens
from going into a war zone.

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,900
mayor, <i>this</i> will be
the war zone.

73
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,200
miranda's following the exact
  same path that eve did.

74
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:06,800
well, that can change.

75
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,100
it won't.
how do you know?

76
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:10,600
do you have any proof to support
  what you're saying?

77
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,400
none.

78
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,800
he has none.
  ah.

79
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,600
this is mr. vargas
  from the parks department.

80
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,800
i asked him to come down here,

81
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,700
 see if he could verify
  any of this for us.

82
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,400
i, uh, wish i could,

83
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:24,200
but i'm afraid russell
doesn't share our view.

84
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,400
as a matter of fact, he doesn't
  even work for us anymore.

85
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,100
our chief suspended him
 yesterday afternoon.

86
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,700
he was concerned that,
 uh, personal issues

87
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,000
have been clouding
  his judgment.

88
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,800
i'm not here representing
 the department, frank.

89
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,300
i'm here as a private citizen,
  a <i>concerned</i> citizen.

90
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,500
so am i, russell.

91
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:44,100
we just got the park
 back open.

92
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,500
tourism is finally
  picking up.

93
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,300
if we do as you say,

94
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,400
we're going to have to close
the whole place down again.

95
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,500
and after the economic hit
  we all took from eve,

96
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,800
does anyone really want this?

97
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,900
if everyone in the park's
  dead, it won't matter.

98
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,600
sorry i'm late, mayor.

99
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,800
my deputy's in the hospital,

100
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,600
and he asked me to pick up
some storm shutters for him,

101
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,800
but dixon's was sold out.

102
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,800
tom, are you supporting
an evacuation?

103
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,900
not a mandatory one,

104
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,400
but i think we should give
  people the option

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,800
and remind them of the unpredictability
 of these things.

106
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,300
i think that being cautious
  would be far less damaging

107
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,700
to tourism than the sight
  of a couple hundred bodies

108
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,300
floating past city hall,
  don't you?

109
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,900
i think they were getting ready
  to string me up in there.

110
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,000
thanks.
 i didn't know you lost your job.

111
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
well, hopefully
it's only temporary.

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,300
i've got szura.

113
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,000
what?

114
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,300
in jail, and i'm going
  to hold him through the storm.

115
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,800
well, what about
the missing hybrids,

116
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,200
the people who were on
 his island?

117
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,800
he won't tell me where they are.

118
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,900
did he give you any idea
about what he's planning?

119
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,000
no, but if i were you,

120
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,300
i wouldn't stick around
  to find out.

121
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,000
take larkin, take the kids and get out of town
  before they lock it down.

122
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
we're already packing.

123
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,400
you got a place to go?

124
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,700
a little motel i spent
some time at as a kid.

125
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,400
a few hours north of here.
what about you?

126
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,900
i'm gonna try
to track down these people,

127
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,200
keep 'em contained.

128
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,400
all right,
  we'll keep in touch.

129
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,500
kira.

130
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,300
hey, lewis.
how you feeling?

131
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,300
okay, i think.

132
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,500
how do i look?

133
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,300
beautiful.

134
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,700
i really appreciate
you being here, kira.

135
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,500
don't understand
how this happened.

136
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,300
it happened
  because people are stupid.

137
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:48,000
is your brother okay?

138
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
my brother... jesse?

139
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,000
he's my <i>stepbrother,</i>
  and who cares?

140
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,400
he's one of the people
 who beat you up.

141
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,300
no, he's wasn't.

142
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,000
he tried to protect me,

143
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,800
maybe even saved my life.

144
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,300
but they were <i>his</i> friends.

145
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,800
no, it was
a couple older guys.

146
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,300
it was my fault, too.

147
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,800
i trust people
way too easily.

148
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
and check the blood banks.

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
we ran out of packed cells
  during eve.

150
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,400
i want to make sure
that doesn't happen again.

151
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,100
but, doctor, the news said--
the news is wrong.

152
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,500
dr. underlay,
 they need you in maternity.

153
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,700
i'll be right there.

154
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
hey there, doc, they told
me i could wait in here.

155
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,000
i hope you don't mind.

156
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,700
uh, what are you doing
 with that camera?

157
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,500
making a documentary.

158
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,800
on what?
the destruction of the entire human race.

159
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,700
 smile.

160
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,300
i'm only half kidding.

161
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,100
if this hurricane comes in carrying anything
 even close to what eve had,

162
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,800
there's gonna be thousands
 of lights in the sky

163
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,200
and even more e.b.e.s
  in the water,

164
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,100
and i'm gonna catch the whole
  thing on tape this time.

165
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,500
i'm not talking about
some fuzzy,

166
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,100
black-and-white
  u.f.o. garbage either.

167
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,300
i'm talking about full-on,
high-def color.

168
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,300
good luck.

169
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,900
thank you.

170
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,000
now to kick it off,

171
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,500
i thought maybe you could be
 my first interview,

172
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,000
a little human-to-hybrid,
  you know?

173
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,100
i'm kind of busy, dave.

174
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,200
yeah, yeah, i can see that,

175
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
but if this thing hits
like i think it's going to--

176
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
is rose here?

177
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,800
what?

178
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,500
this is her backpack.
is she here with you?

179
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,400
no.
what's this doing here?

180
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,900
oh, my god.

181

183
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,900
are you sure
 she's still in school?

184
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,400
yes, i just spoke
to her teacher. she's fine.

185
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
but she did have her backpack
  with her this morning.

186
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,200
where's jesse?

187
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,000
he's at school, too,
but he's on his way here now.

188
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,900
have you talked to him?

189
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,600
mm-hmm,
  and kira's in with lewis,

190
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,700
but i'm scared, tom.

191
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,600
we have to get rose.

192
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,000
dr. underlay, they really
 need you in maternity.

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
i'll go.i'll go get rose.
  are you sure?

194
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,800
yeah, yeah, yeah, i can
  be there in five minutes.

195
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
i'll call you
  soon as i've got her.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,100
oh, my god, russell,
is rose okay?

197
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,900
for now.

198
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,000
but this backpack thing was obviously done
to send a message.

199
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
the weird thing is, underlay
told me he's got szura in jail,

200
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,900
so i don't know who did this.

201
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:30,700
 we have to leave.

202
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,300
we have to get all the kids
 out of here.

203
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:33,700
the roads are gonna
  close at 3:00.

204
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,400
can you be back at the house
in time to make it?

205
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,500
yeah, i think so.

206
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
i've just got one more story
  i've got to do.

207
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,600
russell, how can
i even think of leaving here

208
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,900
without telling people
 what's going on?

209
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,800
there's so many people
  that could die in this storm.

210
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,300
but what can you do?

211
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,400
you should have seen the look
on the face of the city council

212
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
this morning when i was
trying to convince them

213
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,500
that i knew more than
the national weather service.

214
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,200
it was crazy.

215
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,500
no one's going to believe you.

216
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:03,000
i'm supposed to go live at 11:10
  from the fairground.

217
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,800
let me do that, and then
 i'll be home at 11:30.

218
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,000
you'll be fired, you know,
  if you tell the truth.

219
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,500
there is that possibility.

220
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,800
i'll see you soon.

221
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,500
who can tell me
 what "character" means?

222
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,900
jake.

223
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:25,500
character means someone
 who pretends to be something.

224
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,800
okay, anyone else?

225
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,700
rose, what's character?

226
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,800
someone in a show?

227
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,000
all right, yeah, there are
  those kinds of characters,

228
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,200
but what about
 <i>personal</i> character?

229
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,900
 all of our actions
  define our character.

230
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,100
we are what we do.

231
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,400
that's why it's so import--

232
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,600
hi.

233
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,900
i'm, uh,
i'm here to pick her up.

234
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,100
hang on a second.
excuse me, guys.

235
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,400
 can i help you?
yeah, i'm, uh...

236
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,000
i'm dave groves.
i'm rose's uncle.

237
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,800
i'm here to pick her up.

238
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,100
i thought her mother
  was coming.

239
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,100
yeah, she was,
but i'm here instead.

240
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,800
 do you have a note?

241
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,500
do i have a note?

242
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,300
well, we can't let
  any of the children leave

243
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,800
without proper authorization.

244
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,800
okay, i know, but she knows me.
i'm her uncle.

245
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,700
but i don't know you.

246
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
okay, well, why don't
we call her mother then, okay?

247
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,600
after class.
i'm sorry, what?

248
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,000
after i'm finished
with the class.

249
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,300
you're welcome to take a seat
 in the back if you'd like.

250
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:25,400
  okay, guys,
so if we are what we do,

251
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:28,300
 what are
 the two most important ways

252
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,100
that we can define
our character?

253
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,600
 how we live...

254
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,900
and how we die.

255
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,700
his name is eli szura.

256
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
i want to know
 how he got out.

257
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,800
you were all here.

258
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,400
mr. munger, there is blood
  on the wall of that cell.

259
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,100
how did he manage to do that
  on your watch?

260
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,200
he used his elbow, sir.

261
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,000
his elbow?

262
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
he scraped his elbow so hard
against the wall that it bled.

263
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,200
and you just
let that happen?

264
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
i was...

265
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,100
 <i>intrigued</i> by it, sir.

266
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,700
did you release that suspect from the cell?
no, sir!

267
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,600
do you know who did?

268
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,600
 deputy?

269
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:58,300
what was his crime,
 sheriff?

270
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,800
his crime, deputy armis?

271
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,400
his crime was betrayal,

272
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,100
and i consider that
 a very serious offense.

273
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 have any of you
 ever read "robin hood"?

274
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,300
i have.

275
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,500
then you know
that when robin is sick,

276
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,100
he goes to his cousin
 for help,

277
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,300
but robin's cousin
  has other ideas.

278
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,800
she kills him

279
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,800
all to curry the favor of a lousy king.

280
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:35,700
i'm gonna find
 this man.

281
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,700
and i'm gonna arrest him,

282
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,000
and then i'm gonna
come back here,

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,200
and i'm gonna decide

284
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,500
how many of you
 i'm gonna hold responsible.

285
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,800
here you go, lewis.

286
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,300
good as new.

287
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,600
you washed it?

288
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,000
well, the hospital did,

289
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,300
 but i saved your badge.

290
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,800
are you finished eating?

291
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,600
yeah, thanks.

292
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,600
shouldn't you be
  in school?

293
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,100
yeah, but my dad said
  i can hang out with you today.

294
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,600
actually, he asked me to.

295
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,300
he did?
  yeah.

296
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,900
i don't know what's gotten
  into him lately.

297
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,500
he's actually been
 kind of nice.

298
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:47,400
you look... like an angel.

299
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,300
hey.

300
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,800
i came to apologize.

301
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,800
it's okay, jesse.

302
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,200
no, it's not.

303
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,500
i want you to stay here
with lewis

304
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,200
until your dad gets here,
 okay?

305
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,700
okay.

306
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,800
kira, can i talk to you
  for a minute?

307
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,100
sure, i didn't really
 want to be in here with <i>him</i> anyway.

308
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
okay, guys,
20-minute recess.

309
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,200
 afterward, we are gonna get
  started on our dioramas.

310
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,200
cool class, huh?
  yeah, yeah, very interesting.

311
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,500
listen,
  we're getting out of here.

312
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,800
why?
because your mom wants you home.

313
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,900
which home?
your dad's home.

314
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,500
but i have school.

315
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,200
i know. you're getting out
  early today. okay?

316
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,000
uh, miss, um...
  ms. wade.

317
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,400
yeah, do you think you could
  maybe call her mother now

318
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,800
so we can get out of here?
  rose, rose!

319
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,400
she's just going outside.

320
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,000
look, lady, you can't even
  hang on to a backpack.

321
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,500
why am i gonna trust you
  with a kid?

322
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,800
hey, hey, listen,

323
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,500
we got to go to the hospital
 to see your mom, okay?

324
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,200
mr. groves?

325
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,000
all right,

326
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,400
now could you please just
call her mother right now

327
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,200
so we can get out of here?
  we'll be late.

328
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,600
  late for what?
for death.

329
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,000
we have an appointment
  with death

330
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:35,300
we're gonna be late for.

331
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,100
am i now speaking a language you understand?
 okay, what is your problem?

332
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,300
you are.
you're my problem.

333
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,100
do you treat
all the parents this way?

334
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,200
you're not her parent.

335
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,500
and if your sarcasm is meant
  to be funny, it's not.

336
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,900
okay, i'm sorry.
  i'm sorry.

337
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:49,300
  but listen to me,
  ms. wade,

338
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,200
you are teaching
  second grade here.

339
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,400
i think these kids
can put off worrying

340
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,800
about when they're gonna croak
 for a couple more years.

341
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,600
okay, my class is not
about death.

342
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,400
it's about learning
  how to live.

343
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,600
so you're one of those "every
class is a philosophy class" kind of teachers?

344
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,900
no, i am one of those
  "i actually care

345
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,600
"about the quality of
my students' lives" teachers.

346
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,100
do you want to know
  what i think you are?

347
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
dave!
  yeah?

348
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,700
uncle dave,
  do you want a cupcake?

349
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:15,500
cupcakes, that's what you're
  feedin' them, cupcakes?

350
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,000
no wonder you're teaching 'em
about death on a diet like that.

351
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,800
okay, look, i'm dying,
  all right?

352
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,500
 what?
i'm dying.

353
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,600
i have stage iv lymphoma,

354
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,300
and i'll be lucky to make it
  through the semester.

355
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,400
you're kidding.

356
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,200
do i sound like i'm kidding?

357
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,600
that's horrible.
it's reality.

358
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,800
so for as long as i <i>am</i> here,

359
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:40,800
i want to bring something
positive from my experience to these kids.

360
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,800
they're gonna lose me,

361
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,200
and i want them
to understand why.

362
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,400
 i don't want them to think
of it as some great tragedy.

363
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,100
i want them to be prepared.

364
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,000
that's the only way i know
how to make sense of this.

365
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:09,500
  so...
what's her mother's number?

366
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,800
  i'll dial it for you.

367
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,000
  but i don't want to leave.
we have to.

368
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,400
why?

369
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,600
because this man is
making direct threats

370
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,400
against our family.

371
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,800
  well, then why doesn't dad
  arrest him?

372
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,300
he did,
but he got out somehow,

373
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,600
and now your
father's concerned

374
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
that he's gonna
come after us.

375
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,900
have those extra beds arrived yet?
not yet.

376
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,400
okay, i want you to get
  on the phone to miami

377
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,500
and find out where they are.

378
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,800
they really don't think we'll
be needing them, dr. underlay.

379
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,300
that is not for them to decide.
  get them.

380
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,000
we're leaving from
russell's house this afternoon.

381
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,500
dad, too?
dad, too.

382
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,000
 but if this hurricane's
  really coming,

383
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,200
how can dad just
  leave town?

384
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,100
i mean, isn't he in charge of
 all that emergency stuff?

385
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,500
kira, i don't think
you're hearing me.

386
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:53,100
this man and a lot of other
  people like him

387
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,100
may be coming after our family.
  we have to leave.

388
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,200
what about lewis?

389
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
well, he'll be fine.
he'll be safe here.

390
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
  we're leaving him?

391
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,000
not forever, honey.

392
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,200
  no...
kira--

393
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,000
i won't.

394
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,700
i'm not gonna leave him.

395
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,500
 kira!

396
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,700
i'm not going!

397
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,800
  kira, come back here!

398
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,700
  lewis.

399
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,300
sir.

400
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
what are you doing
  out of bed?

401
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,100
it's all right, sir.

402
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,500
any sign of kira?

403
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,000
 no.

404
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,600
  not yet.

405
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,800
but i just got here.
  we'll find her.

406
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,600
there's a hurricane coming,isn't there?

407
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,400
yeah.

408
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,800
it's a big one, isn't it?

409
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,500
  oh, yeah.

410
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,100
 find her, sir.

411
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,700
just give me a minute,
  all right?

412
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,700
and then we'll be
  on our way.

413
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,500
 what if they don't find kira?
  they'll find her.

414
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,500
tom's at the hospital now.
mariel's got her staff looking.

415
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,100
don't worry.

416
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,300
i feel like
  this is all my fault, dad.

417
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,100
if i hadn't gotten involved
  with those guys,

418
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:50,500
then lewis wouldn't be
 in the hospital,

419
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,100
and kira would be home safe.

420
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,700
jesse, kira's got
 her own issues.

421
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,800
this is not your fault.

422
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:00,300
well, do you think she's,
like, in love with him?

423
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,500
because i saw her in the room,
 and she was,

424
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,700
i don't know, looking at him
 like she might be

425
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,300
liking him more than a friend.

426
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,200
does that bother you?
i don't know.

427
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,400
  yeah.
yeah, maybe it kinda does.

428
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,800
but i mean...

429
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,400
 i don't know.
i don't know anything right now.

430
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
jesse...

431
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:30,500
  the next few days
 may get pretty rough, okay?

432
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,600
i'm gonna need you
  to be there

433
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,200
for your mom,
 for your little sister,

434
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,500
for larkin, for everybody.

435
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,300
but no matter
how hard things get,

436
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:39,100
none of this is your fault.

437
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,200
well, where are you
 gonna be?

438
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,300
i'm gonna be inside.

439
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,400
well, it's nice to see
  that one person

440
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
in this department
doesn't think i'm crazy.

441
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,000
oh, no,
 i still think you're crazy,

442
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,400
  but if they're closing off
  blackpoint sound,

443
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,200
i figure somebody somewhere
  knows something.

444
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,700
who's closing off the sound?

445
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
the chief.

446
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,600
vargas called and said no one
would be allowed down there for another 72 hours.

447
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,700
because of the hurricane?
i guess.

448
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,200
this morning vargas said
that no one in the department

449
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,700
thought the hurricane was
coming anywhere near here.

450
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,900
well, maybe you changed
  their mind, russ.

451
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
no.

452
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,000
no way.

453
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,600
 you're getting out of town,
  i hope.

454
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:32,000
yeah, i'm headed up
to my sister's in jacksonville,

455
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,800
even though she's sure
it's coming up there, too.

456
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,900
what are you doing
  with those?

457
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,600
  borrowing 'em.

458
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,400
  hey, look, i told you how
i feel about all this, russ.

459
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,800
the world is turning.

460
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,600
you either go with the flow,
  or you get knocked off.

461
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,100
vargas has always been
  a politician.

462
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,400
he's gonna go
  where the wind blows,

463
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,500
and if the wind is blowing
  towards the sound--

464
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,000
it's gonna be blowing
 <i>everywhere.</i>

465
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
what's so special
about the sound?

466
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,600
 yes, ms. wade.
i'm sorry we missed you earlier.

467
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,700
  but things have just
been a little crazy around here.

468
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,200
rose probably won't be back
  to school until, uh...

469
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,600
um, next week.

470
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,600
but if you give dave
  her homework,

471
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,600
we'll see that
she gets it done.

472
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,000
great.

473
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,400
thank you.

474
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,600
should i have told her?

475
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,300
  she's got
 all those kids there.

476
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
  the schools won't be open
  tomorrow.

477
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,000
 that's the one thing we got
the mayor to agree to today.

478
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,200
what about kira?

479
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,100
i'm going to go to the house,
see if she's there.

480
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,000
i've <i>called,</i> tom.

481
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,200
  maybe she's not picking up.
 meet me at russell's, one hour.

482
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,900
okay?
what if we can't find her?

483
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,100
 we have to.

484
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,900
hey, sheriff.

485
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,900
  i was just talking
with your daughter here.

486
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,500
i can see that.
  come out of the car, honey.

487
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,600
unlock the door.

488
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,800
she seems pretty upset.

489
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,500
unlock the door, deputy.

490
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,300
  go in the hospital
and stay there.

491
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,600
but, dad, why--
 now!

492
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:50,900
 go!

493
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,600
  what are you doing
  out here?

494
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,800
i was just taking a break,

495
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:03,000
 and then i saw your girl,
and she just seemed so sad.

496
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,600
mr. munger, are you there?

497
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,900
get out of the car.
get out of the car!

498
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,000
mr. munger, it's szura.
 are you there?

499
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,700
  mr. munger, are you still
at the hospital?

500
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,800
yes, eli.
we're still at the hospital.

501
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,100
and i'm coming to get you,
  you son of a bitch!

502
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,400
 move!

503
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,200
 where is he?

504
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,600
  i don't know.

505
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:37,400
stop lying. what's he trying
 to sell you, huh, munger?

506
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
he didn't have to
  sell me anything.

507
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,000
we all saw what happened
to lewis.

508
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
lewis, what?you blame me for lewis?

509
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
we can't just sit back
  and wait to become a majority.

510
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,200
no one will let us.
we have to be proactive.

511
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,800
and szura understands that.

512
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,200
szura will protect his people.

513
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,100
  szura's a madman.
he's gonna get us all killed.

514
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:51,900
you, maybe.

515
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,900

  the others?

516
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,500

00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,800
you're a dinosaur.

520
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,500
you and your family--
  all dinosaurs

521
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,600

  that far

525

00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,600
we're on our way home
  via blackpoint sound.

537
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
what's there?

538
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,000
that's a good question.

539
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,500
the chief closed it off,
  and i'd like to know why.

540
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,800
you're not gonna be late,
are you?

541
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,800
no.

542
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,900
i'm proud of you.

543
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,900
so, rose,
 i want you to work on

while you're gone, okay?

545
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,300
and when you come back,
we're gonna have a quiz.

546
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,400

547
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,900

  um, don't ask me
how i know this but--

551
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,000

00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,900
yeah.

553
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,300
yeah, how'd you know that?

554
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,000
life is very unpredictable.

555
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,900
  yeah.

556
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,300

00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,500
  hey, listen,
 um, actually...

559
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000

  i got my camera... right here.

560
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,700

00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,300
  yeah, i mean, you can say
 a couple words if you want,

562
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,800
 but, um, i'm making
a documentary.

563
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,400

564
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,600
 stuff that's, uh,
  happening in the town.

565
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,100
life.

566
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,500

  you'd always had,

570
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,700

571
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,600
 ms. erica wade.

572
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,500
great, so what should i say?

573
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,400
 i don't know.
  start with, um...

574
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,100
whatever you want.
 i don't know.

575
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,000
talk about the, uh...
what, the weather?

576
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,300
no, not the weather.
  that's...

577
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,800
we got everybody talking
  about the weather.

578
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,600
you want to hear a song?

579
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,400
no, no, i don't want
  to hear a song.

580
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,200
you can start with, um...

581
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:43,200
  uh, i know that
  you're busy right now,

582
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,100
so maybe you could say tha

583
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,100
 you will let me come back
  and speak to you another time.

584
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:50,700
  and maybe you would let me

585
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:54,000
buy you a cup of coffee
 some other time.

586
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,700
you could say that.

587
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,000
and maybe
  you could tell me

588
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,400
that when this storm ends,

589
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,800
you'll promise
  to keep yourself safe.

590
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,900
 how about that?

591
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,500
 yes.

592
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,100

676
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:37,500
are you sure they were all from the island?
absolutely.

677
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
what about this vargas?
he's on szura's payroll.

678
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,600
he cordoned off the area
so no one would find them.

679
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,800
you have to send some of
your people out there now.

680
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,500
i'm not sure
 who i've got left, russell.

681
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,600
szura's gotten inside
my department, too.

682
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,700
well, they can't all
 be hybrids.
was vargas?

683
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,500
when people are afraid,
they'll follow anybody.

684
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,500
i don't know who
we can trust anymore,

685
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,800
but we haven't got
the time to find out.

686
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,800
you know what we have to do.
 tom!

687
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:00,400
we're ready to go.

688
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,900
it's the only way, russ.

689
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,100
 okay, honey.carlita's okay?
  yeah.

690
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,400
okay, i just want you
 to hop in the back.

691
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,600

692
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,300

693
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,500
thanks.

694
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:21,800
  hey, mom.

695
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,500
mm-hmm?

696
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:25,100
i'm glad we're all going
together.

697
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,400
me, too.

698
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,400
you <i>have</i> to come with us.
no, i don't.

699
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,700
nobody's looking for me,
 okay?

700
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,300
i'm gonna stay here, put
the whole thing on videotape.

701
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,200
i'm gonna prove to the world
that i'm not crazy.

702
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,000
you could die!

703
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,200
we could all die.

704
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,900
but i could also save
 your house

705
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,500
and maybe civilization
while i'm at it, okay?

706
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,600
so just leave me alone,
  will you?

707
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,900
i'm staying,
end of story.

708
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,200
larkin, hey.
 let's go.

709
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,200
i got the, uh, most of
 the back boarded up.

710
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,900
gonna try and catch the front
  before dark, all right?\

711
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:02,700
thanks, dave.

712
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,500
i don't want to leave him.

713
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,600
  he'll be fine. he can
  take care of himself.

714
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,500
no, he can't.

715
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,900
 come on, honey.
  we <i>have</i> to go.

716
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,600
come on.

717
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,800
all right.

718
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,100
since larkin went public,
there may be more people

719
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:24,000
on the main highway
than we have time for.

720
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,100
well, if the access roads
aren't blocked,

721
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,400
i can get us out
through the 'glades,

722
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,300
at least as far as alligator alley.
we'll follow you.

723
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,100
all right.

724
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:39,900
hey, dave!

725
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,800
yeah?

726
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,400
we'll see you soon.

727
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,700
why are we stopping?

728
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,500
  because we're getting out.

729
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
how much further
  till alligator alley?

730
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,100
probably another half-hour.

731
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,900
  if they just stay
 on this road,

732
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,000
once they're there, they
  shouldn't have any problem.

733
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,700
who shouldn't?
what are you talking about?

734
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,600
larkin, we're not going
with you.

735
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,900
what?
  tom and i have to go back.

736
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,000
go back?

737
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,800
you're not going back.
 szura will kill you.

738
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,700
 <i>both</i> of you.
 no, we talked this through,

739
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,600
and this is the only way.

740
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,100
we had to get you guys out.

741
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,800
we had to make sure that you
guys got through the roadblocks,

742
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,700
and you're safe,
 but we're going back.

743
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,500
you son of a bitch, i'm not
leing you do this to us.

744
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,100
i am not letting you do this.
you're just two men.

745
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:15,100
honey, listen to me,
  it is the only way, okay?

746
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,000
for you, for the kids,
for our baby, it's the only way.

747
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,300
no, it's not the only way.

748
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,800
you could have told us
  the truth.

749
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,500
would you have gone?

750
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,800
what are we supposed
 to tell the kids?

751
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,100
tell 'em we love them...

752
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,700
  and we love you.
that's why we're doing this.

753
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,100
we'll be back.

754
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,800
 you gotta go.

755
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,400
come on.

756
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,000
all right, let's go!

757
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,100
