1
00:00:01,153 --> 00:00:03,091
It's got spikes poking through its head and its neck.

2
00:00:03,092 --> 00:00:05,116
This is definitely the work of an alien, Russ.

3
00:00:05,307 --> 00:00:07,485
Mariel,what is going on with you ?

4
00:00:07,486 --> 00:00:09,947
The first days are the toughest.
Baby steps, honey.

5
00:00:09,948 --> 00:00:10,910
- Who are they ?
- Military ?

6
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:13,471
According to my contact, they were after
a missing weather plane.

7
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:14,467
What's in the box ?

8
00:00:14,868 --> 00:00:16,202
Russell already knows you helped me.

9
00:00:16,345 --> 00:00:18,167
You wanna bea good reporter, talk to me,

10
00:00:18,534 --> 00:00:20,171
just don't tell anyone you're doin' it.

11
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:16,595
All right.  Let's take a look.
That's not bad.

12
00:01:16,948 --> 00:01:18,322
That should hold for a while.

13
00:01:18,443 --> 00:01:19,079
Where'd you get that door ?

14
00:01:19,374 --> 00:01:20,788
It's part of the original house.

15
00:01:21,316 --> 00:01:23,098
I took it off when I added the master bedroom.

16
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:24,769
Here.

17
00:01:25,476 --> 00:01:26,584
Thanks for your help, son.

18
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:27,928
Yeah, I don't know what I did,

19
00:01:27,929 --> 00:01:29,369
but you're welcome.

20
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:32,633
Hey, honey, do you remember a guy named Vince Teracona ?

21
00:01:32,721 --> 00:01:34,151
Sounds like a race car driver.

22
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:35,863
I met him when I first moved out here.

23
00:01:35,864 --> 00:01:36,924
He was in the air force reserve.

24
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:39,318
Yeah, didn't you used to date him ?

25
00:01:39,834 --> 00:01:42,046
- He was more like a friend.
- Yeah, she had a lot of friends.

26
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:43,875
Stop it.  I was thinking about calling him.

27
00:01:44,797 --> 00:01:47,270
Why ? You think he might know something
about that guy I found ?

28
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:50,139
Well, yeah-- Paxton, the downed helicopter,

29
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,508
and that silver box I saw at the crash site.

30
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,156
You think this one guy is gonna know about all that ?

31
00:01:55,157 --> 00:01:56,288
I don't know.
It's a long shot.

32
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,239
- But I figured if I could ask him a few questions. . .
- Daddy !

33
00:01:58,768 --> 00:01:59,899
Daddy, you have to come see.

34
00:02:00,638 --> 00:02:01,283
What, honey ?

35
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:03,297
One of the lights is in the water.

36
00:02:11,012 --> 00:02:11,905
It was right there.

37
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:14,157
What--what kind of lights, Rose ?

38
00:02:14,376 --> 00:02:16,022
Like the ones I saw in the hurricane.

39
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,337
Probably like the ones I saw with Kira in the mobile home.

40
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:20,628
You know what they're talking about ?

41
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:23,440
- You shouldn't be down here, okay, Rose ?
- I was building a fort.

42
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:24,959
Well, let's build one closer to the house.

43
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,009
- Wait a minute.
- Later.

44
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,886
All right, why don't you draw up a plan for the fort,

45
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:40,332
and we'll build it together ?

46
00:02:40,672 --> 00:02:43,607
- I wanna know about the lights.
- You know as much as I do.

47
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:47,889
- But if they're bad--
- Honey, honey, just please draw me a fort.

48
00:02:50,707 --> 00:02:52,108
How long have you known about these things ?

49
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,778
- Since the day after the hurricane.
- And no one told me ?

50
00:02:55,203 --> 00:02:56,641
Or him, and he could've  gotten killed.

51
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:58,278
Hey, I was almost killed,too, okay ?

52
00:02:58,396 --> 00:02:59,917
I've been chasing around after the air force,

53
00:02:59,918 --> 00:03:01,132
trying to find what they're looking for,

54
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:03,068
and all the while,
you've known that there are lights--

55
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:04,725
we don't know anything.

56
00:03:04,984 --> 00:03:07,089
Rose saw some lights during the hurricane.

57
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:10,145
- And Dave got attacked by something in the water.
- That wasn't a gator.

58
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:12,515
- And Jesse saw something, too.
- What are they ?

59
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:14,740
- Fish.
- Fish ?

60
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:17,970
- That fell from the sky ?
- Bioluminescent fish, yes,

61
00:03:18,005 --> 00:03:19,173
that were tossed up by the hurricane.

62
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,578
Yeah, or extraterrestrial biological entity
that the air force found

63
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,963
and locked into a titanium box.

64
00:03:24,172 --> 00:03:25,127
You decide.

65
00:03:26,802 --> 00:03:27,790
What, Russell ?

66
00:03:28,012 --> 00:03:29,586
She said she saw them loading some mystery box

67
00:03:29,587 --> 00:03:30,812
into the back of a semi.

68
00:03:30,921 --> 00:03:32,103
What do you think was in there, tuna ?

69
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,701
- I just can't believe you didn't tell me about this.
- I was gonna tell you.

70
00:03:35,978 --> 00:03:37,487
Dad, why didn't you tell me about this ?

71
00:03:38,747 --> 00:03:40,394
Probably could've saved mea  trip to the hospital.

72
00:03:40,788 --> 00:03:42,752
Russell,someone's here !

73
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:53,526
- Hey, Russ.
- Hey.

74
00:03:53,807 --> 00:03:54,797
Sorry to bother you at home.

75
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,247
- I tried the radio,but there wasn't any answer.
- What's up, Carl ?

76
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:00,082
I was wondering, are you going to flamingo today

77
00:04:00,083 --> 00:04:02,952
- to the damage assess meeting ?
- I don't know.  Why ?

78
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,416
Well, I kind of wondered if maybe we could have lunch

79
00:04:04,417 --> 00:04:05,126
or something.

80
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:06,421
Lunch ?

81
00:04:06,422 --> 00:04:07,843
Yeah, I know,it sounds weird,

82
00:04:07,844 --> 00:04:10,844
but, uh, I don't know who else to talk to here.

83
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,340
Lucy and I are having some problems.

84
00:04:13,597 --> 00:04:15,852
And, uh, well,

85
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:17,516
I know I mentioned it last week,

86
00:04:17,517 --> 00:04:19,713
but it's gettin 'kinda worse, and, um,

87
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,298
- I know you and Mariel,you had--
- Mariel and I aren't married anymore, Carl.

88
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:23,939
Oh, no, no.  I know, I know.

89
00:04:26,649 --> 00:04:27,371
But the thing is that--

90
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:29,640
- I'm going to see that guy, Russell.
- Honey, can you just wait a sec ?

91
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:30,638
- No.
- One sec  ?

92
00:04:31,822 --> 00:04:33,641
Look, Carl, is it okay if we talk later ?

93
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:36,315
- Listen, are you gonna come in at all today ?
- I don't know.  It's my day off.

94
00:04:36,316 --> 00:04:37,271
Hey, Jesse, where are you goin' ?

95
00:04:38,293 --> 00:04:40,056
- For a walk.
- No, stay here. I wanna talk to you.

96
00:04:40,939 --> 00:04:41,629
Is that an order ?

97
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:43,891
Yeah.
Hey, Larkin,please, can you just wait ?

98
00:04:47,308 --> 00:04:48,259
- Damn it.
- Daddy !

99
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:51,898
Instead of a fort,
could we build a tree house ?

100
00:04:52,992 --> 00:04:54,399
This really isn't a good time, Carl.

101
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,803
- Yeah, but will I see you at flamingo ?
- I don't know.

102
00:04:56,804 --> 00:04:58,530
I don't know, but if not today,
tomorrow, okay ?

103
00:04:59,883 --> 00:05:00,564
Yeah.

104
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:02,373
Yeah.

105
00:05:03,914 --> 00:05:04,790
Sure.

106
00:05:09,993 --> 00:05:10,837
Mariel.

107
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:12,941
Morning.

108
00:05:13,318 --> 00:05:14,315
Morning, father.

109
00:05:15,997 --> 00:05:16,737
Meat loaf ?

110
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,992
Yeah.  My attempt at a family dinner.

111
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:22,348
I've been meaning to talk to you.

112
00:05:23,008 --> 00:05:24,767
I heard you had a rough night in the hurricane.

113
00:05:25,483 --> 00:05:26,335
So did I.

114
00:05:27,284 --> 00:05:29,654
We've started a survivor's group at the church

115
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:30,663
if you're interested.

116
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:32,046
A survivor's group ?

117
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:36,207
Yeah, it's for people who've had
an especially traumatic experience.

118
00:05:38,415 --> 00:05:40,566
This is a nondenominational thing,

119
00:05:41,016 --> 00:05:42,503
purely extracurricular.

120
00:05:42,546 --> 00:05:44,520
Just neighbors reaching out to neighbors,

121
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:46,247
trying to help them transition.

122
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:48,152
Transition to what ?

123
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:50,709
Oh, thank you.

124
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:52,130
Who leness.

125
00:05:53,073 --> 00:05:54,561
I'm sure you've hads ome conflicted feelings

126
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,123
since your ordeal. I know I have.

127
00:05:56,124 --> 00:05:57,422
Well, thank you, father.

128
00:05:57,646 --> 00:06:00,759
Um, but I'd like to discuss this with my husband first.

129
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,891
Oh, Tom's all for it.

130
00:06:04,758 --> 00:06:05,257
As a matter of fact,

131
00:06:05,258 --> 00:06:07,388
he's the one who suggested I invite you.

132
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:30,986
What's up, Lewis ?

133
00:06:31,113 --> 00:06:33,312
Owner got back from lunch, found a looter inside.

134
00:06:33,454 --> 00:06:35,216
A looter ? You didn' thave to call me for this.

135
00:06:35,706 --> 00:06:36,988
When we tried to gain entry,

136
00:06:36,989 --> 00:06:38,604
the suspect threatened to shoot.

137
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:40,471
Said he wouldn't come out unless he talked to you. . .

138
00:06:41,444 --> 00:06:42,228
alone.

139
00:06:42,617 --> 00:06:43,410
Really ?

140
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,077
I wouldn't go in by yourself, sir.

141
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,706
It's all right, Lewis. Just keep the car running.

142
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:50,780
Don't you want a flashlight, sir ?

143
00:08:10,695 --> 00:08:11,572
You wanted to see me ?

144
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:12,616
Sheriff.

145
00:08:12,735 --> 00:08:13,763
Put down the gun,Carl.

146
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:18,262
- No, not until you tell me what's goin' on.
- There's nothing to tell.

147
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:21,348
You're breaking and entering.
Put down the gun.

148
00:08:21,478 --> 00:08:22,198
I need it.

149
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:25,666
The owner needs it more.
Put it down.

150
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:30,201
You could a helped me.
Why didn't you help me ? !

151
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:33,569
All right,you want a tree house,

152
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:34,969
you are gonna get a tree house.

153
00:08:35,509 --> 00:08:37,409
But it's so close to the house.

154
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:40,584
Well, we like close.
Close is good, isn't it, Dave ?

155
00:08:40,877 --> 00:08:41,620
Yeah.

156
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,632
Hey, so you got a plan for this thing ?

157
00:08:43,633 --> 00:08:46,708
You wanna go round, square,
one, two platforms, what ?

158
00:08:46,724 --> 00:08:49,866
Um, let's go two platforms,
a ladder and a rope swing.

159
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,393
- You want a rope swing ?
- Sure.

160
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,801
All right.  You're gonna geta rope swing.

161
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,205
But you're not goin' down by that water anymore.

162
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:58,931
At least not until we figure out what's in there.

163
00:09:00,364 --> 00:09:01,140
Right, Rose ?

164
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:02,875
Right.

165
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:08,283
Okay.  All right,uncle Dave, take over.

166
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,815
Uh, yeah.  Okay.

167
00:09:22,686 --> 00:09:23,829
Hey, Jess, it's dad.

168
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:29,988
Son.

169
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:33,422
Will you take those off ?

170
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:38,513
Look, I'm sorry that I didn't tell you
what was going on.

171
00:09:39,632 --> 00:09:41,043
I just didn't want to scare anybody.

172
00:09:41,673 --> 00:09:44,013
I wouldn't have been scared.
I woulda been interested.

173
00:09:45,408 --> 00:09:46,240
I know.

174
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:54,748
- You really think it's a fish ?
- Yeah.

175
00:09:55,659 --> 00:09:58,827
Granted, one that probably doesn't belong here.

176
00:09:59,157 --> 00:10:00,808
- You think it's an alien ?
- No.

177
00:10:02,445 --> 00:10:03,474
Me either.

178
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:12,776
All right.  I'm gonna get back out to work.

179
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:18,210
Hey, dad.

180
00:10:19,508 --> 00:10:22,254
- Do I have to stay at mom's tonight ?
- Yeah.

181
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:23,775
Well, I don't want to.
I want to stay here.

182
00:10:24,184 --> 00:10:25,881
Well, you know I'd love to,
but it's your mom's day.

183
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:28,018
- I know she's gonna want to see you.
- But I don't see her.

184
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:29,760
Since the hurricane,she's hardly ever home,

185
00:10:29,761 --> 00:10:31,967
and when she is, it's like she's not there anyway.

186
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,021
Hey, Russ, Russ.

187
00:10:34,707 --> 00:10:36,119
Some deputy wants to talk to you.

188
00:10:40,532 --> 00:10:41,297
Yeah.

189
00:10:49,929 --> 00:10:50,762
They're inside.

190
00:11:09,122 --> 00:11:10,056
<i>I really don't know what he wanted. </i>

191
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,551
<i>He just drew the gun on me so fast. </i>

192
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:20,507
Tom.

193
00:11:21,061 --> 00:11:21,828
Hey.

194
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:24,321
- How did this happen ?
- Maybe you can tell me.

195
00:11:34,886 --> 00:11:36,709
So you said he came over to see you this morning.

196
00:11:36,857 --> 00:11:40,444
Yeah, he wanted to talk,have lunch.

197
00:11:42,187 --> 00:11:44,044
Any idea why he might have done this ?

198
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:47,322
He said he was having problems at home.

199
00:11:47,323 --> 00:11:48,316
Have you talked to Lucy ?

200
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:49,846
- Who ?
- His wife.

201
00:11:50,582 --> 00:11:52,319
No.  No, not yet.

202
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,452
We have a couple of deputies on the way to the house right now.

203
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:56,317
Damn it !

204
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:58,543
Were you close with the family ?

205
00:11:59,147 --> 00:11:59,861
Used to be.

206
00:11:59,909 --> 00:12:02,847
When Mariel and I were married,
we hung out quite a bit.

207
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:05,479
Why didn't I talk to him ?

208
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,693
Sheriff,here's your backup.

209
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,504
The gun that was fired has been impounded pending investigation.

210
00:12:17,034 --> 00:12:19,130
- Will there bean investigation ?
- Of course.

211
00:12:19,154 --> 00:12:20,183
You had no choice, sir.

212
00:12:21,986 --> 00:12:23,388
You always have a choice,Lewis.

213
00:12:24,656 --> 00:12:26,307
You just have to be sure you make the right one.

214
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:30,692
Thanks.

215
00:12:38,668 --> 00:12:42,493
<i>all vehicles must display a D. O. D.  Security tag at all times. </i>

216
00:12:47,353 --> 00:12:48,616
Can I have some I. D. ,Ma'am ?

217
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:51,248
I'm here to see master sergeant Vince teracona.

218
00:12:51,402 --> 00:12:52,805
Do you know what unit he's with, ma'am ?

219
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,640
- Civil engineering offices.
- Okay.

220
00:12:54,927 --> 00:12:57,357
Clear ! That'll be straight down on your right, ma'am.

221
00:12:57,406 --> 00:12:58,903
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

222
00:13:28,165 --> 00:13:29,347
- Larkin.
- Vince.

223
00:13:30,628 --> 00:13:32,078
- How are you ?
- Awesome.

224
00:13:33,123 --> 00:13:33,987
How are you, mama ?

225
00:13:34,144 --> 00:13:36,438
Be careful.  You might get my breakfast in your lap.

226
00:13:37,421 --> 00:13:41,702
Wow.  You look awesome.
You don't look fatat all.

227
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:43,630
thanks.

228
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:45,983
I-I'm so glad you called.

229
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:47,980
You know,nobody ever believes me when I tell them

230
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:50,426
I used to date Larkin groves of the channel 7 I-team.

231
00:13:50,754 --> 00:13:51,993
What does the "I"stand for anyways ?

232
00:13:51,994 --> 00:13:54,415
Is it like eye "I" or just I "I" ?

233
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:57,290
Just "I" for investigation.

234
00:13:58,015 --> 00:13:59,995
Oh, well, I hope you're not investigating me today.

235
00:14:00,927 --> 00:14:02,542
Not unless you have something to hide.

236
00:14:03,989 --> 00:14:05,165
Our chariot awaits.

237
00:14:15,273 --> 00:14:18,651
<i>the sheriff's office has confirmed
it was indeed Tom Underlay</i>

238
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:20,213
<i>in this officer-involved shooting. . . </i>

239
00:14:23,601 --> 00:14:24,320
hey, Kira.

240
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:29,075
- Have you heard about this ?
- Yes.  It's all over the radio.

241
00:14:30,641 --> 00:14:32,586
- Has your father called in ?
- No.

242
00:14:32,587 --> 00:14:34,377
<i>The victim was ranger Carl mckittrick,</i>

your friends with his son, aren't you ?

245
00:14:38,963 --> 00:14:39,673
Yeah.

246
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:41,535
What am I gonna say to him ?

247
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:43,667
Sorry my dad killed your dad ?

248
00:14:46,434 --> 00:14:47,184
Tom ?

249
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,653
- Tom, is that you ?
- Sorry, it's just me.

250
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,693
- I came by to get some clothes.
- Clothes, for what ? Come here.

251
00:14:58,124 --> 00:14:58,770
For what ?

252
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:01,048
I want to stay at dad's tonight.

253
00:15:01,903 --> 00:15:02,800
No.

254
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:04,632
No.  Tonight's our night.

255
00:15:04,966 --> 00:15:07,319
Mom, it's not really gonna be that great of a night, is it ?

256
00:15:07,398 --> 00:15:08,139
What does that mean ?

257
00:15:08,539 --> 00:15:10,218
- Have you seen the news ?
- Yes.

258
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:11,592
It kinda sucks.

259
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,691
Jesse. Jesse, come here.

260
00:15:15,268 --> 00:15:16,047
Come here.

261
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:20,416
Now I want you to be here.

262
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:23,996
Under the circumstances,
I think we need to be together as a family.

263
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:28,920
- I don't want to be here tonight.
- Why ?

264
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:34,913
Hey, Kira.

265
00:15:37,766 --> 00:15:38,656
Jesse.

266
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:40,953
- Jesse !
- What ? !

267
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:48,943
Jesse.

268
00:15:51,772 --> 00:15:52,877
I'll talk to him.

269
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:10,153
Russell.

270
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,667
Hey.

271
00:16:15,689 --> 00:16:17,741
Oh, Lucy.  I'm so sorry.

272
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:24,016
do you want some coffee ?It's still hot.

273
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,564
The deputies just left.

274
00:16:30,808 --> 00:16:33,644
Honey, do you remembermr.  Varon ?

275
00:16:35,069 --> 00:16:35,710
Hey, Gage.

276
00:16:36,596 --> 00:16:37,479
Hey.

277
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,396
I'm sorry about your dad.

278
00:16:42,685 --> 00:16:43,599
Thanks.

279
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,009
It's sweet of you to come by, Russell.

280
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:51,234
I'm sure a lot of people must have--

281
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:53,596
must have called,but with the phones out. . .

282
00:16:53,874 --> 00:16:55,275
yeah, Lucy, uh,

283
00:16:55,712 --> 00:16:57,955
Carl came to see methis morning.

284
00:17:00,902 --> 00:17:01,908
Why ?

285
00:17:03,586 --> 00:17:05,136
Um. . .  I guess he wanted to talk.

286
00:17:05,827 --> 00:17:07,450
He said you two were having problems.

287
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:14,148
- Was he sober ?
- I think so.

288
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:19,161
He didn't own a gun,you know ?

289
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:24,703
- I'm sure that's why he broke into that place.
- To steal a gun ?

290
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:28,231
Things with us haven't been good
for a long time, Russell.

291
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:31,149
But since the hurricane,it has just been insane.

292
00:17:31,841 --> 00:17:34,402
<i>Carl was drinking a lot,he'd gotten very abusive--</i>

293
00:17:34,797 --> 00:17:35,885
<i>physically abusive. </i>

294
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:38,435
I-I can't believe that.

295
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:41,069
He was very depressed,angry.

296
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:44,367
<i>I just don't think he wanted
the burden of a family anymore. </i>

297
00:17:45,065 --> 00:17:46,250
Last night I told him I wanted a divorce,

298
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:47,483
and he went crazy.

299
00:17:49,367 --> 00:17:50,673
I finally had to call the sheriff.

300
00:17:54,330 --> 00:17:55,321
Sheriff Underlay ?

301
00:17:56,328 --> 00:17:57,426
If he hadn't shown up,

302
00:17:58,261 --> 00:17:59,713
I don't know what might have happened.

303
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:01,243
The sheriff said he didn't know you.

304
00:18:03,071 --> 00:18:04,119
I mean, if Carl had a gun last night,

305
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,378
I don't know, I just. . .

306
00:18:07,473 --> 00:18:08,778
<i>you wouldn't have recognized him. </i>

307
00:18:09,096 --> 00:18:12,001
<i>He wasn't the same person. I couldn't. . . </i>

308
00:18:14,276 --> 00:18:16,035
Jesse, will you just wait for me a sec ?

309
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:17,638
I waited all night for you, Kira,

310
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,014
while you and that. . .

311
00:18:21,064 --> 00:18:21,823
whatever.

312
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:23,366
I hope it was worth it.

313
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:25,236
- Nothing happened.
- Yeah, right.

314
00:18:26,012 --> 00:18:27,186
Is that why you don't want to be at our house,

315
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:28,217
'cause of me ?

316
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:30,851
I just wanna help out my dad, okay ?

317
00:18:31,613 --> 00:18:35,378
- What about your mom ?
- What about her ?

318
00:18:35,636 --> 00:18:38,404
- She's really upset.
- She'll be fine.

319
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,749
Look, I know she's not perfect,

320
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,367
but she's doing the best she can, okay ?

321
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:43,419
We all are. At least you have a mom.

322
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:47,768
You're right.

323
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:51,808
Jesse. . .

324
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,281
will you come with me to see Gage ?

325
00:18:55,922 --> 00:18:57,360
I wouldn't know what to say to him.

326
00:18:57,753 --> 00:18:59,334
I don't know what to say to him either.

327
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,728
All right.

328
00:19:13,603 --> 00:19:14,575
Shoot !

329
00:19:29,771 --> 00:19:31,040
- Hey, Russell.
- Hey, Mariel.

330
00:19:32,155 --> 00:19:32,830
What's up ?

331
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:35,670
- Did you hear about Carl ?
- Yeah.

332
00:19:37,348 --> 00:19:38,233
It's awful.

333
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:41,428
Come in.

334
00:19:46,878 --> 00:19:47,646
You all right ?

335
00:19:48,904 --> 00:19:49,540
Yeah.

336
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:51,947
No.

337
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:54,672
actually, I should go grab a band-aid.

338
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:58,350
Is Tom home ?

339
00:19:59,052 --> 00:19:59,686
No.

340
00:20:00,646 --> 00:20:03,055
- Have you talked to Lucy ?
- I just saw her.

341
00:20:03,689 --> 00:20:04,718
How is she ?

342
00:20:06,011 --> 00:20:06,831
Not good.

343
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:10,702
You know, apparently, she and Carl
have been having problems.

344
00:20:12,036 --> 00:20:12,849
Finally.

345
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:14,634
Sorry, Russell,can this wait ?

346
00:20:14,635 --> 00:20:16,310
- Can what wait ?
- Where have you been ?

347
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:20,464
I've been trying to reach you all morning.

348
00:20:20,792 --> 00:20:22,141
I've been trying to reach you, too.

349
00:20:22,742 --> 00:20:23,935
You're on the wrong channel, honey.

350
00:20:25,745 --> 00:20:27,157
just dropping offt he kids, Russ ?

351
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,299
No, I just saw Lucy mckittrick.

352
00:20:32,768 --> 00:20:33,934
Honey, can you give us a minute ?

353
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,111
Tom. . .

354
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:39,126
- I need to talk to you.
- Just a minute.

355
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:55,180
I'm sorry if this is a bad time.

356
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,639
It's a bad day. What's up ?

357
00:20:57,905 --> 00:20:59,734
Why didn't you tell me you were
at Carl's house last night ?

358
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,203
I asked you if you knew Lucy,you said no.

359
00:21:02,204 --> 00:21:03,092
What differencedoes it make ?

360
00:21:03,093 --> 00:21:04,164
You could've arrested him.

361
00:21:04,165 --> 00:21:05,622
She said he was beating her up pretty bad.

362
00:21:05,623 --> 00:21:07,395
Russell, do you know how many domestic dispute calls

363
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:08,895
I've had since the hurricane ?

364
00:21:10,542 --> 00:21:12,013
People are comin' apart at the seams.

365
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,002
No water, no power--

366
00:21:15,134 --> 00:21:17,887
if I arrested every guyt hat looked like
he was about to go off the deep end,

367
00:21:17,888 --> 00:21:19,548
that would be about half this town.

368
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,225
I made a judgment call last night.

369
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:24,978
I thought the situation was contained.

370
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,103
Obviously, I was wrong.

371
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:31,634
But why are you the one that seems so guilty ?

372
00:21:33,832 --> 00:21:34,819
He was my friend.

373
00:21:37,524 --> 00:21:38,803
Your friend tried to kill me.

374
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,794
And we both had a chanceto help him,
but we didn't.

375
00:21:48,295 --> 00:21:51,426
The only difference is you knew
how dangerous the situation was.

376
00:21:52,823 --> 00:21:54,060
I'm sorry I called you.

377
00:21:55,889 --> 00:21:58,478
- I'm not gonna leave this alone, Tom.
- You do what you have to do.

378
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:00,244
I'm not gonna let this go.

379
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,268
So how's married life ?

380
00:22:18,972 --> 00:22:20,804
You've been hitched now,what, almost a year ?

381
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:23,532
- Yeah, a year in november.
- And it's great ?It's all great ?

382
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,287
It's pretty great.

383
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:27,926
What about you, Vince ?

384
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:29,633
You, uh, you where you wanna be ?

385
00:22:29,852 --> 00:22:31,734
Well, I'm a senior master sergeant now,

386
00:22:31,735 --> 00:22:33,830
so I'm pretty much in charge of this place.

387
00:22:34,073 --> 00:22:36,121
- You run the base ?
- No.  No, no, no.

388
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:37,607
That'd be the air base wing commander.

389
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,372
But anything maintenance related,

390
00:22:39,373 --> 00:22:42,543
every structure,all operations--that's me.

391
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,879
Hey, you wouldn't know anything
about a downed helicopter,would you ?

392
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,776
Or a missing weather plane,anything like that ?

393
00:22:48,218 --> 00:22:50,899
Downed helicopter ?
You tryin' to give usa bad name ?

394
00:22:53,298 --> 00:22:54,064
Hold on now.

395
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:55,614
We're entering a special clearance area.

396
00:22:57,077 --> 00:22:58,106
What goes on in there ?

397
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,737
Oh, that's an O. S. I.  Hangar.

398
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:01,530
Office of special investigations.

399
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:03,678
They don't let mere mortals anywhere near there.

400
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:06,194
But if you'd like to see the weather facility,

401
00:23:06,195 --> 00:23:07,358
I could arrange that.

402
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,134
And they got a great little lunch spot right next door.

403
00:23:09,135 --> 00:23:10,306
- Sound good ?
- Yeah.

404
00:23:11,254 --> 00:23:14,637
Two hamburgers and some freedom fries coming up.

405
00:23:20,459 --> 00:23:21,245
Where you going ?

406
00:23:23,367 --> 00:23:24,358
To see the priest.

407
00:23:27,601 --> 00:23:28,594
Isn't that what you want ?

408
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:30,804
The priest ?

409
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:33,744
Yeah, I bumped into father scanlon
at the market this morning.

410
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:38,557
He said you wanted me to join his survivor's group.

411
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,990
Be nice if you had talked to me about it.

412
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,167
But maybe you discussed it with Russell instead.

413
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:44,167
Mariel.

414
00:23:44,385 --> 00:23:46,401
I've been worried sick about you all morning, Tom,

415
00:23:46,402 --> 00:23:48,973
and you come home and just dismiss me.

416
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:51,124
I didn't dismiss you. I--what--

417
00:23:52,754 --> 00:23:54,068
how do you feel aboutwhat happened ?

418
00:23:54,843 --> 00:23:57,008
I feel confused and. . .

419
00:23:58,231 --> 00:23:58,985
by what ?

420
00:24:00,018 --> 00:24:01,670
- You killed somebody.
- I know.

421
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:05,265
- So why aren't you more upset about it ?
- I am.

422
00:24:06,077 --> 00:24:08,614
Doesn't seem like it. You don't seem upset at all.

423
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:11,111
- Why aren't you upset ?
- Because I knew it was gonna happen.

424
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:18,191
You knew what was gonna happen ?

425
00:24:18,284 --> 00:24:19,915
From the moment I walked into that place this morning,

426
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:22,355
I knew that that guy was gonna be dead.

427
00:24:23,642 --> 00:24:25,784
I don't know why,I don't know how,
I just knew.

428
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,283
Like I know a lot of things.

429
00:24:33,489 --> 00:24:36,298
Do you know how your wife
is feeling right now ?

430
00:24:43,102 --> 00:24:44,297
Alone.

431
00:25:18,946 --> 00:25:19,863
Mariel.

432
00:25:22,546 --> 00:25:23,814
Hey, father.

433
00:25:24,062 --> 00:25:25,827
Our meeting's notuntil 7:00.

434
00:25:26,489 --> 00:25:28,967
I was. . . in the neighborhood.

435
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:33,012
I heard about what happened this morning.

436
00:25:34,289 --> 00:25:35,325
Is Tom all right ?

437
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:39,619
I think he will be.

438
00:25:43,372 --> 00:25:45,165
Did you know mr.  Mckittrick ?

439
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:46,692
I know his wife.

440
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:49,012
It's very sad.

441
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,368
Yes.

442
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:53,242
Who lives and who dies--

443
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:56,735
it all seems so random,doesn't it ?

444
00:25:58,032 --> 00:25:59,463
It's not, of course.

445
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:02,991
Are you sure ?

446
00:26:05,077 --> 00:26:06,706
Who are you talking to ?

447
00:26:09,345 --> 00:26:10,238
What's wrong, Mariel ?

448
00:26:13,434 --> 00:26:14,393
I, um. . .

449
00:26:17,179 --> 00:26:18,629
I'm worried about my family.

450
00:26:21,431 --> 00:26:22,879
My son Jesse--

451
00:26:23,579 --> 00:26:25,192
I don't know if you remember him.

452
00:26:29,121 --> 00:26:31,437
I don't think he wants to live with me anymore.

453
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,504
Since the hurricane,

454
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:40,149
I. . .  haven't beenas attentive.

455
00:26:44,016 --> 00:26:45,449
I've been very distracted.

456
00:26:50,618 --> 00:26:52,511
And Tom is just so. . .

457
00:26:53,492 --> 00:26:54,857
hard to reach sometimes.

458
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,469
Did I tell you I was from minnesota ?

459
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,596
Did you know that ?

460
00:27:10,627 --> 00:27:11,405
No.

461
00:27:11,859 --> 00:27:12,722
Well, I am.

462
00:27:13,876 --> 00:27:14,713
When I was a kid,

463
00:27:15,382 --> 00:27:16,632
I used to do a lot of skiing,

464
00:27:16,633 --> 00:27:18,279
but I was never very good

465
00:27:18,746 --> 00:27:20,210
because I was always so busy

466
00:27:21,171 --> 00:27:22,916
trying to hang onto the mountain.

467
00:27:24,004 --> 00:27:25,384
Don't fall down,don't fall down--

468
00:27:25,385 --> 00:27:27,418
that's all I kept telling myself.

469
00:27:28,984 --> 00:27:30,710
So, of course,that's all I kept doing.

470
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,922
I can't let go of my family.

471
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:38,213
You don't have to.

472
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:42,962
If Jesse wants to live with his dad for a while,

473
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,017
let him.

474
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,191
Russell's not perfect.

475
00:27:48,525 --> 00:27:50,464
Jesse may start to appreciate you more

476
00:27:50,465 --> 00:27:52,253
if he has some time away.

477
00:27:56,882 --> 00:27:57,804
And Tom ?

478
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,788
You're nevergoing to lose him.

479
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:05,521
Ever.

480
00:28:12,165 --> 00:28:13,171
Does he come here ?

481
00:28:13,837 --> 00:28:14,689
No.

482
00:28:15,949 --> 00:28:18,423
But I'd be happy to invite him if you'd like me to.

483
00:28:19,969 --> 00:28:22,969
And. . .  if that meat loaf will keep a day,

484
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,281
I hope you'll join us.

485
00:28:35,956 --> 00:28:36,647
okay.

486
00:28:36,653 --> 00:28:38,360
Are we going to have to do this all by ourselves ?

487
00:28:38,361 --> 00:28:40,064
Yeah, I guess we are.

488
00:28:41,508 --> 00:28:43,555
I thought daddy and Jesse were going to help.

489
00:28:43,834 --> 00:28:46,632
Well, they were a little bit busy.

490
00:28:47,708 --> 00:28:48,501
But you know what ?

491
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:50,843
- We can do it on our own, right ?
- We can.

492
00:28:51,121 --> 00:28:51,977
Yeah, we can.

493
00:28:53,588 --> 00:28:54,580
Hey, what was that, uh. . .

494
00:28:55,739 --> 00:28:57,719
what was that spanish songy ou were singing earlier ?

495
00:28:57,981 --> 00:28:59,464
"SeÑora santana" ?

496
00:28:59,662 --> 00:29:00,750
Yeah.  What is that ?

497
00:29:01,217 --> 00:29:04,809
SeÑora santana,
por qué llora el niÑo ?

498
00:29:05,055 --> 00:29:06,838
No, I mean in english,what does it mean ?

499
00:29:07,191 --> 00:29:09,814
It's about a boy who's crying 'cause he lost his apple.

500
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:10,929
How'd he lose his apple ?

501
00:29:11,111 --> 00:29:11,892
I don't know,

502
00:29:12,053 --> 00:29:13,017
but seÑora santana

503
00:29:13,018 --> 00:29:14,437
tries to give him a new one,

504
00:29:14,438 --> 00:29:16,287
and he doesn't want that one.

505
00:29:17,139 --> 00:29:18,508
He wants the one he lost.

506
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:21,420
Yeah.  I think a lot of guys can relate to that.

507
00:29:23,126 --> 00:29:24,217
Keep singing that song. Come on.

508
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,165
oh, yeah,keep that rhythm strong.

509
00:29:38,931 --> 00:29:39,465
Here we are.

510
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:43,061
This'll just take a second, Larkin.

511
00:29:47,542 --> 00:29:48,922
See ? It's weather world.

512
00:29:50,304 --> 00:29:52,620
You can plan your next vacation here.

513
00:29:53,332 --> 00:29:54,183
Just give me two minutes, okay ?

514
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:55,122
But you gotta stay here.

515
00:29:55,123 --> 00:29:56,132
You got it.

516
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,300
take it to the pine island visitors' center in the park.

517
00:30:31,301 --> 00:30:32,185
Okay.

518
00:30:32,925 --> 00:30:33,572
Thanks.

519
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:41,020
Hey, deputy. Were there cameras inside ?

520
00:30:41,021 --> 00:30:42,097
Was there a generator,by chance ?

521
00:30:42,098 --> 00:30:43,187
No, sir.

522
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,346
So no one witnessed the shooting ?

523
00:30:45,697 --> 00:30:47,713
No, sir. At the suspect's request,

524
00:30:47,714 --> 00:30:49,257
the sheriff went in alone.

525
00:30:51,274 --> 00:30:53,264
Carl asked to see Underlay ?

526
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:54,619
Yes, sir.

527
00:30:57,642 --> 00:30:58,389
Thank you.

528
00:31:22,116 --> 00:31:22,933
Gage ?

529
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:25,865
- Hi.
- Hey.

530
00:31:28,002 --> 00:31:29,127
What are you doing here ?

531
00:31:32,672 --> 00:31:34,361
- Whoa, wait a second.
- What do you want ?

532
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:37,828
To apologize.

533
00:31:39,107 --> 00:31:41,384
I had no idea what was goin' on in your house.

534
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:44,051
You still have no idea.

535
00:31:45,203 --> 00:31:48,064
Yeah, well, maybe not,but. . .

536
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,698
I'm sorry.

537
00:31:50,711 --> 00:31:52,977
You know, your dad was always a good friend to me.

538
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:55,919
If you ever need to talk,about anything. . .

539
00:31:56,947 --> 00:31:58,729
you know what my mom told you

540
00:31:59,231 --> 00:32:01,743
about. . .  my father abusing her ?

541
00:32:02,436 --> 00:32:03,750
It's total garbage.

542
00:32:05,305 --> 00:32:06,953
She was the one beating on him.

543
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:09,003
If he needed a gun,

544
00:32:09,004 --> 00:32:10,751
it was only to protect himself.

545
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,225
Ever since they pulled her out of the water,

546
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,832
she's been like a completely different person.

547
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:20,866
We lost mom the night eve hit.

548
00:32:22,781 --> 00:32:23,619
Red cross found her,

549
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,853
but she didn't come back the same.

550
00:32:29,686 --> 00:32:31,544
He just wanted her to be the same.

551
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:38,852
Gage.

552
00:33:10,163 --> 00:33:10,948
Gage.

553
00:33:11,376 --> 00:33:12,434
You following me ?

554
00:33:12,964 --> 00:33:14,138
I came to talkto your mom.

555
00:33:14,568 --> 00:33:15,446
She's not here.

556
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,223
Where is she ?

557
00:33:18,158 --> 00:33:18,544
I don't know.

558
00:33:18,545 --> 00:33:20,555
Probably at the church where she always is now.

559
00:33:20,947 --> 00:33:21,620
The church ?

560
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,908
Hurricane survivors group.

561
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,738
Her new family.

562
00:33:30,365 --> 00:33:32,296
- Where you goin' ?
- To my uncle's.

563
00:33:33,689 --> 00:33:35,137
My mom doesn't want me here anymore.

564
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,330
Wait a minute,you're movin' out, today ?

565
00:33:39,421 --> 00:33:40,596
She didn't want my dad,

566
00:33:40,597 --> 00:33:41,899
and now she doesn't want me.

567
00:33:45,435 --> 00:33:47,157
Say hello to your son for me.

568
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,413
Man, you are a dog with a bone today, aren't you ?

569
00:36:28,512 --> 00:36:31,173
- What are you doing here, Tom ?
- Selling bibles. What are you doing ?

570
00:36:31,495 --> 00:36:33,044
You know, I talked to your deputy today.

571
00:36:33,068 --> 00:36:35,669
I know you did.  I also know you talked to the kid.

572
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:37,969
Tell me, are you working as
an official ranger detective now ?

573
00:36:38,053 --> 00:36:39,606
Carl asked to see you this morning.

574
00:36:41,074 --> 00:36:42,920
Was it because he was concerned about his wife ?

575
00:36:43,536 --> 00:36:44,863
About what happened to her in the hurricane ?

576
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:47,418
Like I said earlier, there'll be a full investigation
into the shooting.

577
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:49,206
I'm not talking about the shooting, Tom.

578
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:50,674
I'm asking you if you know--

579
00:36:50,675 --> 00:36:52,979
specifically--what happened to Lucy.

580
00:36:56,246 --> 00:36:58,462
I mean, you protected her at Carl's expense.  Why ?

581
00:37:01,722 --> 00:37:02,951
Why, is it because she's part of this ?

582
00:37:04,072 --> 00:37:05,830
Is that what it is,because she's a survivor ?

583
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,147
What the hell does that mean, Tom ?

584
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:10,918
What is happening to all these people ?

585
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:16,063
Oh, no.

586
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:27,248
She shouldn't be here.

587
00:37:29,262 --> 00:37:30,428
She belongs here.

588
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,277
I take care of my loved ones.

589
00:37:35,596 --> 00:37:37,354
Maybe you oughta think about doin' the same.

590
00:37:52,342 --> 00:37:57,263
- Well, thanks Vince.  For the tour.
- I'm just glad we're able to see each other again

591
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:59,059
- Take care of that baby, huh  ?
- Yeah.

592
00:38:00,547 --> 00:38:01,706
- Bye, babe.
- Bye.

593
00:38:25,952 --> 00:38:28,127
<i>As those of you who've been with usbefore know,</i>

594
00:38:28,694 --> 00:38:33,335
this is a place where people come together
to tell their stories of survival.

595
00:38:33,462 --> 00:38:36,059
And hopefully, find greater meaningin our lives.

596
00:38:37,868 --> 00:38:42,420
But with the blessings of a second chance
come greater responsibilities.

597
00:38:43,216 --> 00:38:46,586
And nobody knows that betterthan sheriff Tom Underlay.

598
00:38:56,663 --> 00:38:58,926
Did you know your husband was gonna talk tonight ?

599
00:38:59,631 --> 00:39:00,321
No.

600
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:05,948
Unlike most of you, who've endured
the trauma of a hurricane,

601
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:08,595
my story goes back a few years.

602
00:39:09,043 --> 00:39:10,563
It's a story that some of you know. . .

603
00:39:11,727 --> 00:39:17,686
but for those of you who don't,
in 1996, my wife and I. . .

604
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:21,715
my first wife--

605
00:39:22,921 --> 00:39:25,887
were on a flight to atlanta
to visit her sister

606
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,716
when I heard a loud, popping sound.

607
00:39:28,724 --> 00:39:30,020
<i>It was 2:10 in the afternoon. </i>

608
00:39:31,114 --> 00:39:35,547
<i>In the next three minutes,the plane banked
and headed back toward miami. </i>

609
00:39:37,007 --> 00:39:38,490
<i>But the cabinfilled with smoke. </i>

610
00:39:40,263 --> 00:39:43,020
<i>53 seconds later, the plane dropped 6,000 feet. . . </i>

611
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:45,632
<i>crashed into the everglades</i>

612
00:39:47,008 --> 00:39:49,137
<i>and spread debrisover a solid square mile. </i>

613
00:39:54,598 --> 00:39:55,835
At this point, I--

614
00:39:56,505 --> 00:39:58,315
I really don't rememberwhat happened.

615
00:40:00,403 --> 00:40:01,715
They tell me that they immediately
called off the search for survivors,

616
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,716
that it was impossible for anyone to live through the crash.

617
00:40:07,691 --> 00:40:10,963
<i>They also tell me that 19 hours later. . . </i>

618
00:40:12,832 --> 00:40:14,604
<i>two rescuers pulled me from the water. . . </i>

619
00:40:17,811 --> 00:40:18,623
breathing. . .

620
00:40:20,335 --> 00:40:21,145
intact. . .

621
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,390
alive.

622
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:27,806
On this horrible day,over a hundred people died.

623
00:40:30,274 --> 00:40:31,366
But not me.

624
00:40:33,676 --> 00:40:35,150
I was the sole survivor.

625
00:40:38,773 --> 00:40:41,057
<i>And it took me a hell of a long time to figure out why. </i>

626
00:40:43,982 --> 00:40:46,927
<i>And I know a lot of you be asking yourselves that question. </i>

627
00:40:49,283 --> 00:40:51,142
<i>But ultimately,it doesn't matter </i>

628
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,432
<i>because. . . </i>

629
00:40:55,558 --> 00:40:57,035
I don't know why I lived.

630
00:40:59,408 --> 00:41:00,868
I don't know how I lived.

631
00:41:02,203 --> 00:41:03,644
But I do know that I emerged. . .

632
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:08,259
stronger and with a clearer purpose.

633
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:12,439
And that's the promise that hurricane eve holds
for all of you.

634
00:41:13,858 --> 00:41:18,044
Whether you believe it's god's gift
or, no offense, father,just sheer luck. . .

635
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:21,529
you have all been given a second chance on life,

636
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:23,566
and I encourage you not to squander it

637
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,607
or dwell on why you were chosen.

638
00:41:27,792 --> 00:41:29,091
<i>We make choices every day. </i>

639
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:35,264
<i>Some that are clear, and some not so clear. </i>

640
00:41:36,821 --> 00:41:41,772
<i>But I believe that we have been chosen
to rebuild this community</i>

641
00:41:43,492 --> 00:41:44,901
<i>as we rebuild ourselves. </i>

642
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:48,749
<i>Some of us will rise to the challenge. </i>

643
00:41:50,561 --> 00:41:51,484
<i>Others won'T. </i>

644
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:57,088
But we will all ultimately. . .

645
00:41:58,771 --> 00:41:59,761
survive.

646
00:42:02,714 --> 00:42:04,667
Because we already have.
