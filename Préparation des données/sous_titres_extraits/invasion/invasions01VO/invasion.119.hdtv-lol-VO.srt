Sheriff Tom Underlay.

2
00:00:01,927 --> 00:00:03,232
I protect the community.

3
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:06,175
There's a little work camp
down in the glades

4
00:00:06,358 --> 00:00:08,998
that an old friend of mine
runs-a mr. Szura.

5
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:15,408
I want to find out why
the air force is down here,

6
00:00:15,409 --> 00:00:16,944
and if there's a cover-up,
who's involved.

7
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:17,999
According to my contact,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,746
they were after
a missing weather plane.

9
00:00:20,924 --> 00:00:22,561
How many crew members
from that weather plane

10
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:23,940
you have locked
in this place ?

11
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,920
All of them.

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:26,003
What are you doing with them?

13
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:28,287
Testing them. They really are
amazing creatures.

14
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,826
They aren't creatures.

15
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:32,017
I'm worried about Jesse.

16
00:00:32,018 --> 00:00:33,494
They're hybrid bastards, mom.

17
00:00:33,525 --> 00:00:34,840
- You wanna go?
- Come on, bring it.

18
00:00:40,177 --> 00:00:41,574
Jesse, give me the gun.

19
00:00:41,735 --> 00:00:43,734
No way. The gun's mine.

20
00:00:46,901 --> 00:00:49,784

24
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:30,006
Dad.

25
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:31,655
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

26
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:33,384
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it was you.

27
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:35,815
It's not loaded.

28
00:01:39,252 --> 00:01:40,366
Where are the bullets?

29
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:43,904
In the tackle box.

30
00:01:48,216 --> 00:01:49,631
- Hey!
- Hey, nothing!

31
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:52,354
- What are you so pissed about?
- This!

32
00:01:52,646 --> 00:01:53,995
Well, I've had it
for a while now!

33
00:01:53,996 --> 00:01:54,754
Why is it bugging you?

34
00:01:54,755 --> 00:01:55,817
Because you shot it-

35
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,094
while you were drinking.

36
00:01:57,156 --> 00:01:58,505
You were shooting
at pictures of your mom?!

37
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:00,599
What is wrong with you?

38
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:02,259
Why are you sneaking
in my room?

39
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:04,444
You got no right
to come in here and do that.

40
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:07,279
That gun is mine! My other
father gave that to me.

41
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,911
Your other father
is a sick bastard!

42
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:11,720
And the only reason
that i let you keep this gun

43
00:02:11,721 --> 00:02:13,843
is because you promised you'd
keep it in the display box!

44
00:02:14,488 --> 00:02:16,918
I better not ever hear about
you shooting any gun again.

45
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:18,361
- You understand me?
- How are you supposed to hear about it

46
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:19,461
when you're not around?

47
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:22,460
I haven't seen or heard
from you in two days, dad!

48
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:24,310
And if you're so concerned
about our family,

49
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,525
then why don't you check in
on us once in a while?!

50
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:28,745
I've been out of range.

51
00:02:29,050 --> 00:02:31,263
Oh. Oh! And now
that you're in range,

52
00:02:31,264 --> 00:02:33,332
your wife tells you that
I've gone all columbine!

53
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,547
And isn't that nice-

54
00:02:34,548 --> 00:02:36,287
now I got another stepparent
I can count on!

55
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:38,020
She is worried about you, Jesse.

56
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:39,553
We all are!

57
00:02:39,554 --> 00:02:41,975
You got bigger things
to worry about than me, dad!

58
00:02:41,976 --> 00:02:43,472
In case you haven't heard,

59
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:45,959
the town has gone
"night of the living dead."

60
00:02:46,265 --> 00:02:47,923
Half the people
aren't even human anymore!

61
00:02:47,924 --> 00:02:51,475
And from what I understand,
my stepfather likes it that way!

62
00:02:51,853 --> 00:02:53,419
So if you want to be
pissed off at somebody,

63
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,203
why don't you be
pissed at him?!

64
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:02,328
I am.

65
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:08,566
Where you going now?

66
00:03:09,563 --> 00:03:10,089
I'm going out.

67
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,472
Russell, you just got back.

68
00:03:11,934 --> 00:03:12,747
Russell!

69
00:03:55,292 --> 00:03:56,516
Mariel...

70
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,335
what are you doing?

71
00:04:00,697 --> 00:04:02,201
Cleaning.

72
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:07,105
- It's 2:00 in the morning.
- I couldn't sleep.

73
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:10,724
You know, this could be
a really useful space for us.

74
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:14,009
Besides your guns, we could keep
all kinds of supplies in here.

75
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:16,251
Never hurts to be prepared.

76
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,797
Prepared for what?

77
00:04:24,411 --> 00:04:26,277
Rainy day?

78
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:31,955
Instinct is everything.

79
00:04:33,254 --> 00:04:35,714
Instinct is the key
to survival.

80
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:39,683
Most people
distrust their instinct.

81
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:43,451
They discount
their inner voice

82
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:47,987
because they allow their brain
to rationalize that voice away.

83
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,284
Well, we're not
"most people" anymore.

84
00:04:50,937 --> 00:04:54,424
I didn't ask any of you
to meet me on this beach,

85
00:04:55,309 --> 00:04:56,624
but here you are.

86
00:04:57,489 --> 00:05:00,975
Because you knew something
was amiss tonight.

87
00:05:01,264 --> 00:05:02,653
You're feeling anxious.

88
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,854
You should be.

89
00:05:05,588 --> 00:05:09,256
The threat from the outside
that I've repeatedly

90
00:05:09,257 --> 00:05:12,400
warned you about
is upon us now,

91
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:16,287
and now is the time
for us to take advantage

92
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:20,459
of this incredible gift
that we have been given...

93
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:26,908
for us to rise up
and act as one!

94
00:05:29,171 --> 00:05:30,971
<i>Has the whole world
gone insane?</i>

95
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:32,818
<i>It's the middle of the night,
and I can hear</i>

96
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:36,180
my hybrid stepmother downstairs
scrubbing the closet floor

97
00:05:36,181 --> 00:05:38,657
<i>while my hybrid father
hands her dishrags.</i>

98
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:42,379
Is this urge to disinfect
part of your D.N.A. Now, too,

99
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:45,503
or is it just that my family
is still crazier than everyone else's?

100
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,027
All families
are crazy, Kira.

101
00:05:48,669 --> 00:05:50,989
Some just hide it
better than others.

102
00:05:51,192 --> 00:05:54,657
So you're not in your bathroom,
secretly fighting soap scum?

103
00:05:54,678 --> 00:05:55,843
<i>No.</i>

104
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:02,033
though... I have been feeling
a little restless tonight.

105
00:06:02,497 --> 00:06:05,952
<i>I feel better now, though,
talking to you.</i>

106
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:10,936
I miss you, Lewis.

107
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,535
How's, uh, school?

108
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:18,932
< i>Weird.</i>

109
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:21,154
All the kids
are different now.

110
00:06:21,928 --> 00:06:22,792
<i>Like me?</i>

111
00:06:23,306 --> 00:06:26,096
No, not like you.

112
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,212
They're not as nice.

113
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:31,895
<i>And a lot of them used
to be my friends.</i>

114
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:35,603
Oh. I'm sorry.

115
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:40,845
<i>It's like you can really feel
these two totally separate groups forming.</i>

116
00:06:41,159 --> 00:06:45,137
And I'm worried that my stepbrother Jesse's
going to a dark place with it all.

117
00:06:52,842 --> 00:06:53,755
Who is that?

118
00:06:57,474 --> 00:06:59,291
I have no idea.

119
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:12,454
Russell.

120
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:26,115
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

121
00:07:26,116 --> 00:07:27,034
Tom?

122
00:07:27,145 --> 00:07:29,857
I don't think your wife's
gonna like what I have to say.

123
00:07:31,508 --> 00:07:34,811
Russell,
what are you doing here?

124
00:07:34,904 --> 00:07:35,919
Are the kids all right?

125
00:07:36,603 --> 00:07:37,866
Yeah, they're fine.

126
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,635
We're just-we're having
a little problem in the park.

127
00:07:40,636 --> 00:07:42,228
I was hoping
that Tom could help

128
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:45,120
before things
really get out of control.

129
00:07:51,201 --> 00:07:52,818
Your buddy Szura
is a murderer.

130
00:07:54,638 --> 00:07:56,776
He's killed at least
four people that I know of,

131
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:59,720
two of whom
you sent to his island.

132
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:03,388
I know all about
the place, Tom.

133
00:08:04,113 --> 00:08:05,846
And tomorrow, the world's
gonna know about it, too.

134
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:06,926
Who has he killed, Russ?

135
00:08:06,957 --> 00:08:08,774
Christina Conrad,
Derek Cooley...

136
00:08:09,861 --> 00:08:11,718
probably father Scanlon
by now.

137
00:08:16,911 --> 00:08:19,883
I sent them to the island because
he promised me he would protect them.

138
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:22,038
- Do you ever get tired of lying?
- I'm not lying!

139
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,308
What, do you think
you know it all?

140
00:08:23,852 --> 00:08:25,745
Maybe Szura was trying to
protect himself. I don't know.

141
00:08:25,746 --> 00:08:26,388
I wasn't there.

142
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,091
Is that the same reason
you gave Jesse a gun?

143
00:08:28,151 --> 00:08:29,440
So he can "protect" himself?

144
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,772
This has nothing
to do with Jesse.

145
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,603
Those people
needed to be contained.

146
00:08:34,603 --> 00:08:36,186
The priest tried to kill me- what are you doing?

147
00:08:36,186 --> 00:08:37,959
Maybe you deserved it.
You know, I'm sick of your games!

148
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:39,741
This is no game!

149
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:43,189
You are destroying my family,
you son of a bitch!

150
00:08:44,194 --> 00:08:45,330
I'm trying
to save your family,

151
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:47,287
you stupid bastard!

152
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,816
You may be stronger than we are,

153
00:08:50,988 --> 00:08:52,510
but i know you can die.

154
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:53,518
Go ahead, kill me.

155
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,666
Come on, Russ, do it.
Do it, come on. Do it.

156
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:56,943
You wanna do it, do it.
Do it.

157
00:08:57,485 --> 00:08:58,323
- I can't!
- Why not?!

158
00:08:58,324 --> 00:08:59,573
Because it's not loaded!

159
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:14,514
I am done keeping
the big secret, Tom.

160
00:09:14,857 --> 00:09:16,140
I mean,
people are dying.

161
00:09:17,097 --> 00:09:18,784
You may not be
killing them yourself,

162
00:09:18,846 --> 00:09:19,893
but you are party to it.

163
00:09:19,894 --> 00:09:21,445
You really don't get it,
do you?

164
00:09:21,458 --> 00:09:23,436
I'm not your problem!

165
00:09:23,607 --> 00:09:25,173
Do you realize
the military knows

166
00:09:25,174 --> 00:09:28,249
about those creatures
in the water since '96?

167
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,706
Since my plane crash.

168
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,665
I've seen the pictures.

169
00:09:33,978 --> 00:09:36,017
- What pictures?
- From hangar 42.

170
00:09:37,606 --> 00:09:39,742
Szura with the N.T.S.B...

171
00:09:39,807 --> 00:09:41,343
Szura with the wreckage.

172
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:44,136
Szura with all the air force
brass-I've seen them all.

173
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:47,111
Your partner's
a very popular guy.

174
00:09:49,573 --> 00:09:54,667
- Szura... with the military?
- Come on, Tom.

175
00:09:55,251 --> 00:09:56,586
You can't keep denying it.

176
00:10:02,877 --> 00:10:03,802
Where are you going?

177
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:10,976
- Find out what the hell he's doing.
- You're too late for that.

178
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,643
I already have a team going out
to that island to pick him up.

179
00:10:13,644 --> 00:10:15,878
And when they do, you're gonna have
a lot of questions to answer.

180
00:10:16,985 --> 00:10:18,350
This doesn't end
with Szura, Tom.

181
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:21,486
This ends with you!

182
00:10:31,804 --> 00:10:33,706
Are you sure you don't wanna
bring anyone else along, sir?

183
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:35,902
No, no, the fewer people
who know about this, the better.

184
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:37,391
But this island's
pretty isolated.

185
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:40,857
- What if mr. Szura-
- Hey, outside. Come on.

186
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,373
What if mr. Szura doesn't
want to talk to us, sir?

187
00:10:44,374 --> 00:10:45,780
I don't give a damn
what he wants.

188
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:47,720
Is he really capable
of murder, sir?

189
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:48,916
We're all capable, Lewis.

190
00:10:48,917 --> 00:10:50,854
We all have the potential
to go to our darkest place,

191
00:10:50,855 --> 00:10:53,297
but most of us manage
to leave a light on.

192
00:11:00,754 --> 00:11:01,597
It's all in here-

193
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:03,722
the hybrids' master plan.

194
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:04,882
Everything-it's in here.

195
00:11:05,126 --> 00:11:06,541
Thought it was
Szura's master plan.

196
00:11:07,365 --> 00:11:09,735
Well, he wrote it,
but he had a lot of help.

197
00:11:09,998 --> 00:11:10,800
"The appearance of new forms

198
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,781
and the disappearance
of old ones are bound together."

199
00:11:12,782 --> 00:11:14,559
- You know who said that?
- A magician?

200
00:11:15,444 --> 00:11:16,487
Charles darwin.

201
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:17,684
Who's he?

202
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:21,322
He's a dead english guy.
Listen to your music.

203
00:11:21,323 --> 00:11:24,205
Did you know that
95% of all the species

204
00:11:24,206 --> 00:11:25,984
that once lived on this planet
have died out?

205
00:11:26,004 --> 00:11:27,079
That blows my mind.

206
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,877
Basically, the overriding
message of this whole plan

207
00:11:28,878 --> 00:11:30,617
is that the hybrids
are the chosen people,

208
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:32,064
and our extinction
is inevitable.

209
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:41,006
And who knows what
the fourth element is? Rose.

210
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:44,817
Water. W-a-t-e-r.

211
00:11:44,977 --> 00:11:45,850
Excellent.

212
00:11:47,861 --> 00:11:49,643
Okay, so there they are.

213
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:53,113
Those are the four elements-
earth, air, fire and water.

214
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:57,183
So what do you guys
think they represent?

215
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:01,726
Balance.

216
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:06,106
The balance between
all things in nature.

217
00:12:06,551 --> 00:12:08,398
For the world
to function effectively,

218
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,316
you must always have balance-

219
00:12:11,171 --> 00:12:14,376
economic balance,
ecological balance,

220
00:12:15,232 --> 00:12:17,331
the balance between
life and death.

221
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:22,374
Ms. Wade, some of us don't know
what you're talking about.

222
00:12:36,987 --> 00:12:39,496
Who can tell me
what this word means?

223
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:49,498
- How's life, man?
- Beautiful.

224
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,333
- You still living in your car?
- Nah, I moved up.

225
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,910
My grandmother's house
got red-tagged,

226
00:12:55,961 --> 00:12:57,483
so now I'm sLeeping
in her rubble.

227
00:12:57,484 --> 00:12:58,371
Sweet.

228
00:12:59,128 --> 00:13:01,568
At least I went a whole morning
without getting my ass kicked.

229
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:02,623
Oh, yeah, that's good.

230
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,241
That's good, man.
That's real good.

231
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,782
Nice face, man.
You're looking good.

232
00:13:16,792 --> 00:13:18,226
What's so damn funny?!

233
00:13:25,414 --> 00:13:27,341
Come on. Come on, man.

234
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:35,274
Well, that was real subtle.

235
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:38,292
Screw 'em, man. I feel like
I'm in occupied france.

236
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:39,966
The trains are rolling, man,

237
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:43,335
and nobody is doing anything
to stop them.

238
00:13:44,953 --> 00:13:46,980
My sister was almost drowned
yesterday.

239
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,474
They pulled her into the pool

240
00:13:50,409 --> 00:13:52,209
and held her under
until she passed out.

241
00:13:53,255 --> 00:13:54,757
Was my girlfriend
a part of that?

242
00:13:55,937 --> 00:13:57,682
Oh, yeah, she's
one of 'em, too, now.

243
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,200
Looks like I'll be looking
for a new prom date.

244
00:14:01,622 --> 00:14:02,958
They're not all bad.

245
00:14:03,231 --> 00:14:05,761
Everyone's just scared 'cause they don't know
what's going on right now.

246
00:14:07,203 --> 00:14:08,274
And you do?

247
00:14:08,818 --> 00:14:10,886
Not completely,
but I'm not afraid.

248
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:14,050
Maybe that's 'cause
your boyfriend's one of 'em.

249
00:14:14,294 --> 00:14:15,092
He's not my boyfriend.

250
00:14:15,093 --> 00:14:16,015
Really?

251
00:14:16,193 --> 00:14:19,929
She hangs out with this guy
who's my stepdad's deputy.

252
00:14:20,473 --> 00:14:21,162
He's 26.

253
00:14:21,163 --> 00:14:22,824
This isn't
about Lewis, Jesse.

254
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,568
Why don't you mind
your own business, okay?

255
00:14:24,569 --> 00:14:26,000
Then why don't you?

256
00:14:34,059 --> 00:14:35,651
We can't just let this
keep happening.

257
00:14:35,652 --> 00:14:38,339
'Cause pretty soon, there's not
gonna be any of us left.

258
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:41,192
What about talking
to your stepdad?

259
00:14:41,344 --> 00:14:42,207
Are you kidding me?

260
00:14:42,691 --> 00:14:43,881
The guy is one of 'em, too.

261
00:14:43,882 --> 00:14:45,964
Well, you said he's been
this way for a long time.

262
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,748
Maybe he knows
how to stop it.

263
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:50,578
He doesn't want to stop it.

264
00:14:50,579 --> 00:14:52,336
He took my mother to the water

265
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:53,924
and made her the way
that she is.

266
00:14:53,965 --> 00:14:56,486
And your dad, man-he probably
took him to the water.

267
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,341
And maybe he took
your girlfriend. Who knows?

268
00:14:59,623 --> 00:15:01,129
He may have done this
to everybody.

269
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,346
Frank.

270
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:27,716
- Hey.
- Hey, Russ.

271
00:15:27,778 --> 00:15:28,460
Hey.

272
00:15:29,284 --> 00:15:30,870
I thought we were gonna meet
down at the chief's office.

273
00:15:31,776 --> 00:15:33,794
Mona, could you give us
a couple of minutes?

274
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:35,984
Thank you.

275
00:15:37,172 --> 00:15:38,457
¿Que pasa? How are you?

276
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:42,717
I've had better days.

277
00:15:43,191 --> 00:15:47,380
I've heard, um, Mona said you
were pretty stressed out lately.

278
00:15:50,767 --> 00:15:52,031
What's up, frank?

279
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,463
Well, um, after I got
your call last night,

280
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:01,235
we went through the whole mess
with the coast gard.

281
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:04,427
And this morning, the chief
talked to the sheriff about-

282
00:16:04,428 --> 00:16:07,054
He talked to underlay?
Why?

283
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:10,013
- Because he's the sheriff, Russell-
- He's also a murderer.

284
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,314
Mira, the chief doesn't
quite see it that way.

285
00:16:13,985 --> 00:16:15,879
Matter of fact, he thinks
you've overstepped here.

286
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,794
He thinks i overstepped?

287
00:16:16,795 --> 00:16:19,829
And this relief worker Dennison
that you want arrested?

288
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,621
His name is Szura.

289
00:16:20,622 --> 00:16:22,444
Whatever. He's very close
to the chief.

290
00:16:23,461 --> 00:16:24,161
What?

291
00:16:25,371 --> 00:16:30,817
Yeah, and apparently,
underlay knows and respects the guy as well.

292
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:33,610
Oh, no, no...
Frank, come on, man.

293
00:16:33,852 --> 00:16:35,770
Don't do this to me.
Not you, too.

294
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:38,740
Underlay said he's willing
to go to this island

295
00:16:38,741 --> 00:16:40,332
and check things out for us.

296
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,156
Underlay is the reason
Szura is on the island.

297
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,161
He's the reason
all of this has happened.

298
00:16:45,162 --> 00:16:47,013
All of what?
All of what, Russell?

299
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:54,078
Yeah, I'll go talk
to the chief myself.

300
00:16:54,462 --> 00:16:56,627
- He won't see you.
- He doesn't understand the situation.

301
00:16:56,628 --> 00:16:57,988
You don't understand!

302
00:16:58,432 --> 00:17:01,626
The chief is not gonna
talk to you! ¿Me entiendes?

303
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:04,380
In fact, he doesn't wanna even
see you around here anymore.

304
00:17:05,667 --> 00:17:06,649
What are you saying?

305
00:17:10,901 --> 00:17:13,503
He's placing you
on administrative leave.

306
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,252
He just thinks that you should
take some time and go home

307
00:17:17,253 --> 00:17:18,567
and be with your family.

308
00:17:21,132 --> 00:17:22,386
Frank...

309
00:17:24,487 --> 00:17:26,274
you listen to me, okay?

310
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:29,976
None of us will have any family
left if we don't do something.

311
00:17:29,977 --> 00:17:31,088
¿Me entiendes?

312
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,896
I'm sorry.

313
00:17:40,294 --> 00:17:41,346
Did you sell me out?

314
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:44,361
Did you tell Vargas you thought
I should be taken off the job?

315
00:17:44,664 --> 00:17:45,437
Of course not.

316
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:47,155
Well, then what did you say?

317
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:49,704
That you've been working 24-7
since the hurricane,

318
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:52,028
and that you've been having
some issues at home.

319
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:54,084
What issues?

320
00:17:54,489 --> 00:17:55,643
I work with you every day.

321
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:59,209
The kids, your ex-wife,
the sheriff, your wife.

322
00:17:59,798 --> 00:18:01,382
I've seen every side
of the equation.

323
00:18:01,383 --> 00:18:03,993
None of that has affected
my ability to do my job.

324
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:05,261
I didn't say
that it did, Russ.

325
00:18:05,262 --> 00:18:06,989
I think you're the best person
I've ever worked with.

326
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:09,741
You've got knowledge
and character both.

327
00:18:09,932 --> 00:18:11,081
And I respect the hell
out of you.

328
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:12,021
Then what'd you say to him?

329
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:13,871
That I love you
and I'm afraid for you, Russ.

330
00:18:14,997 --> 00:18:16,785
I'm afraid for you
and your family.

331
00:18:18,676 --> 00:18:19,799
Why?

332
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:21,760
Because I know
what's happening in town,

333
00:18:21,761 --> 00:18:23,638
and you can't stop it.

334
00:18:24,584 --> 00:18:27,395
It's the way things
are supposed to be, Russ.

335
00:18:27,854 --> 00:18:30,581
You can't stop change
like this.

336
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:34,109
You can only live your life
the best way you can

337
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,836
and hope that whatever you
leave behind has some value.

338
00:18:47,496 --> 00:18:51,350
Are you... one of them?

339
00:18:54,306 --> 00:18:56,174
Does it matter?

340
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:12,894
Can I put my stuff
in your locker?

341
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:14,030
Sure. Why?

342
00:19:14,473 --> 00:19:16,764
I got about ten hybrids
blocking mine.

343
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,038
Maybe we should talk
to your stepdad, Jess.

344
00:19:20,973 --> 00:19:21,969
What for?

345
00:19:22,582 --> 00:19:26,218
He'll do what you said.
He'll try and stop this.

346
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,609
- Dude, he's not gonna talk to us.
- Maybe we can make him talk.

347
00:19:28,823 --> 00:19:29,977
Look, I know some guys.

348
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:31,868
They might want to help us out.

349
00:19:33,043 --> 00:19:35,182
- What kind of guys?
- Guys who can make people talk,

350
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:37,444
even when they
don't want to.

351
00:19:39,686 --> 00:19:40,920
You know where he is?

352
00:19:41,314 --> 00:19:43,080
Yeah, he went on
some boat trip.

353
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:45,371
He's gonna be back
around 6:00.

354
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:47,271
Where's he keep his boat?

355
00:19:50,868 --> 00:19:52,384
Black point Marina.

356
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,064
Look, Brett,
I don't like the guy at all.

357
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:03,910
And I don't trust him at all,
but, I mean, he is my stepdad.

358
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:04,589
And he's the sheriff.

359
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,242
Yeah, the sheriff
that killed your mother.

360
00:20:08,704 --> 00:20:11,215
Look, my father finally
kicked my mother out last night.

361
00:20:12,153 --> 00:20:13,899
I knew it was coming,
but...

362
00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:17,778
come on, man,
she called me crying.

363
00:20:18,065 --> 00:20:19,647
Crying like crazy...

364
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,957
wanting to know
if she could stay with me.

365
00:20:23,235 --> 00:20:25,202
What am I supposed
to do with that, man?

366
00:20:25,947 --> 00:20:27,861
What am I supposed to do
when she calls me,

367
00:20:27,862 --> 00:20:28,942
crying on the phone

368
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:31,120
because my hybrid father
kicked her out on the street?

369
00:20:37,022 --> 00:20:38,771
I just want
some answers, man.

370
00:21:01,439 --> 00:21:03,176
Are you sure he didn't know
we were coming, sir?

371
00:21:04,574 --> 00:21:05,456
Yes.

372
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,020
I just searched
those bypasses again.

373
00:21:07,021 --> 00:21:08,160
Everyone's gone.

374
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:10,390
Place is completely deserted.

375
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:13,808
Do you have any idea
where they could have gone?

376
00:21:15,668 --> 00:21:17,163
Yes, Lewis, I do.

377
00:21:19,786 --> 00:21:21,073
I do.

378
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,784
"God said let the waters
bring forth abundantly

379
00:21:30,785 --> 00:21:32,899
the moving creature
that hath life."

380
00:21:34,558 --> 00:21:36,224
That's Szura.

381
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:38,440
And he's quoting
the old testament.

382
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:42,012
So he's using all of the big ideas
to rally the troops, right?

383
00:21:42,065 --> 00:21:42,856
Yeah.

384
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:44,223
But to what end?

385
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:47,152
I mean, his book definitely
supports the notion

386
00:21:47,153 --> 00:21:49,417
that evolution is inevitable.

387
00:21:49,581 --> 00:21:52,663
And the book is called
"robin hood and the cambrian explosion."

388
00:21:53,368 --> 00:21:57,426
And robin hood says the best way
to get the job done is guerilla-style.

389
00:21:59,979 --> 00:22:01,813
Robin had sherwood forest
to do all his dirty work in.

390
00:22:01,814 --> 00:22:03,395
What does Szura have?

391
00:22:03,528 --> 00:22:04,590
The island.

392
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:08,993
The water.

393
00:22:10,421 --> 00:22:11,981
When Russell and i
were in Szura's bunker,

394
00:22:11,982 --> 00:22:12,887
we found a downlink station

395
00:22:12,888 --> 00:22:14,896
where they were monitoring
the temperatures in the ocean.

396
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:16,342
We thought maybe they were
checking up on the lake creatures.

397
00:22:16,343 --> 00:22:19,880
But what if they were actually tracking
the currents for themselves?

398
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:21,281
Yeah, but for what purpose?

399
00:22:21,785 --> 00:22:22,607
I don't know.

400
00:22:23,865 --> 00:22:26,909
I don't know, maybe to ride into
town on the crest of a giant...

401
00:22:27,935 --> 00:22:29,069
wait...

402
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:31,650
look.

403
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:34,685
There's a storm developing
in the southern caribbean.

404
00:22:36,738 --> 00:22:40,926
Okay. The lights came in
during the hurricane, right?

405
00:22:41,167 --> 00:22:42,785
And hybrids
are basically amphibious,

406
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:45,398
so wouldn't it stand to reason
if you were a hybrid psychopath

407
00:22:45,508 --> 00:22:48,110
planning an invasion,
you might do it under the cover of a storm?

408
00:23:03,235 --> 00:23:03,822
Hey.

409
00:23:03,823 --> 00:23:05,432
Front door was open.

410
00:23:05,475 --> 00:23:06,477
Oh, thanks.

411
00:23:06,901 --> 00:23:07,843
Tom is not here.

412
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:09,623
I know.

413
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,375
I got suspended
from my job.

414
00:23:18,216 --> 00:23:21,289
Apparently, somebody at the top
thinks I've become a liability.

415
00:23:22,788 --> 00:23:23,840
I'm sorry.

416
00:23:25,862 --> 00:23:28,152
Yeah, well...

417
00:23:30,634 --> 00:23:34,804
I... I'm thinking about
going out of town for a while,

418
00:23:35,388 --> 00:23:37,538
and I want to take the kids.

419
00:23:40,472 --> 00:23:42,017
What about school?

420
00:23:42,412 --> 00:23:44,622
I'll get their books, their homework.
I'll work with them.

421
00:23:45,687 --> 00:23:47,406
- Where are you gonna go?
- I don't know yet.

422
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:55,102
Okay, um...

423
00:23:55,366 --> 00:23:57,614
well, just tell me...

424
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:01,944
when you're going,
when you'll be back.

425
00:24:03,222 --> 00:24:05,673
I'd like you to consider
coming with us.

426
00:24:09,211 --> 00:24:11,125
Mariel, whatever's happened
in this town,

427
00:24:11,126 --> 00:24:13,551
I'm certain that
it's not accidental.

428
00:24:14,335 --> 00:24:15,436
These changes have a purpose,

429
00:24:15,437 --> 00:24:17,971
and I'm afraid that that purpose
is about to be realized.

430
00:24:20,343 --> 00:24:22,244
Did you ever tell Tom
what's inside of you now?

431
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:24,268
That you're basically
carrying enough eggs

432
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,649
to spawn an entirely
new species on your own?

433
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,895
- Not yet.
- So what if you get pregnant?

434
00:24:29,641 --> 00:24:32,311
- That is really not your problem.
- I disagree.

435
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:33,347
You saw Christina.

436
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:35,411
That girl had a litter
growing inside of her.

437
00:24:35,412 --> 00:24:36,397
You think
she could have survived?

438
00:24:36,398 --> 00:24:39,114
- It's not your problem!
- I think it's all of our problem!

439
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,709
And for our kids' sake, just
think about what I'm saying.

440
00:24:43,891 --> 00:24:45,437
So does larkin
know you're here?

441
00:24:46,494 --> 00:24:47,935
No, but she will.

442
00:24:47,936 --> 00:24:49,356
What about my husband?

443
00:24:49,578 --> 00:24:51,716
Is he invited to come on this
little trip you're planning?

444
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,610
I suspect he'll have
other plans.

445
00:24:58,954 --> 00:25:02,940
I don't understand why you keep
doing this to me, Russell.

446
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:05,067
He's my husband!

447
00:25:05,068 --> 00:25:08,774
Whether you like it or not,
he is my husband!

448
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:10,074
- I know, Mar-
- Get out of here.

449
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:12,647
- Mariel-
- Get out of my house!

450
00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:19,551
Just think about
what I said.

451
00:25:31,514 --> 00:25:34,246
So you told Mariel everything and
she wouldn't listen to you ?

452
00:25:35,323 --> 00:25:36,539
No.

453
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:38,990
Your job...

454
00:25:39,363 --> 00:25:40,818
is this permanent?

455
00:25:41,723 --> 00:25:42,938
I don't know.

456
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:45,521
They're all in on it.

457
00:25:46,387 --> 00:25:49,279
Szura, Underlay, the chief,
the air force...

458
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:51,188
You're Silkwood, man.

459
00:25:51,581 --> 00:25:52,413
You're Karen Silkwood-

460
00:25:52,414 --> 00:25:55,147
blowing the whistle the nobody wants to hear,
you know what I mean?

461
00:25:55,177 --> 00:25:57,438
- Where's Jesse?
- He's at his friend's.

462
00:25:57,439 --> 00:25:57,763
He called.

463
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,346
He said he wasn't gonna
be home for dinner.

464
00:26:00,945 --> 00:26:02,874
- What's he doing?
- Daddy?

465
00:26:04,512 --> 00:26:06,581
Which state do you go to
when you die?

466
00:26:07,206 --> 00:26:08,241
What?

467
00:26:08,552 --> 00:26:10,390
Our teacher told us
that when we die,

468
00:26:10,804 --> 00:26:13,289
we leave our bodies
and go to another state.

469
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,701
Which one is it?

470
00:26:15,668 --> 00:26:17,585
Your second grade teacher
taught you this?

471
00:26:17,747 --> 00:26:18,379
Yeah.

472
00:26:18,883 --> 00:26:21,495
- "The balance of life and death"?
- It's my homework.

473
00:26:23,234 --> 00:26:25,202
- Who's this teacher?
- She's new.

474
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,126
Well, maybe it's time for a little
parent-teacher conference, eh, Russ?

475
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,668
Did Jesse tell you
where he was going?

476
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:37,411
No, but he promised
he wouldn't be late.

477
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:40,446
- Russell, where are you going?
- I'm gonna go find him.

478
00:26:40,471 --> 00:26:41,736
Russell, come back here!

479
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,434
You're not doing this again!

480
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:44,902
You can't just keep leaving

481
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,754
without giving me an explanation
for what's going on.

482
00:26:46,755 --> 00:26:47,988
You know what's going on.

483
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:50,327
Yeah! And it's affecting
all of us.

484
00:26:50,711 --> 00:26:53,231
Me, dave, your daughter,
your son-

485
00:26:53,563 --> 00:26:54,719
we're all feeling it.

486
00:26:55,454 --> 00:26:56,568
So stop acting
like you're the only one

487
00:26:56,569 --> 00:26:58,067
trying to hold things
together.

488
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,155
You're not.

489
00:27:04,166 --> 00:27:05,390
I'm sorry.

490
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:08,675
It's just a lot,
you know?

491
00:27:09,841 --> 00:27:11,177
I do.

492
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:18,875
Look, when Jesse called,
he was with his friend Brett.

493
00:27:19,258 --> 00:27:20,176
I think I have
his parents' number

494
00:27:20,177 --> 00:27:21,798
if you wanna try
to call them.

495
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:23,065
Okay.

496
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,054
They got him about ten minutes
after the boat came in.

497
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,094
He was tying it up.

498
00:27:49,272 --> 00:27:50,587
Got him how?

499
00:27:51,913 --> 00:27:53,270
They said they knew
what he was,

500
00:27:54,497 --> 00:27:56,102
that they just
wanted to talk.

501
00:27:57,692 --> 00:28:00,776
- And he was cool with that?
- I guess so.

502
00:28:02,466 --> 00:28:03,852
He's waiting for us.

503
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:33,665
- What is this place?
- It's my grandmother's.

504
00:28:35,143 --> 00:28:36,036
Nice, huh?

505
00:28:37,726 --> 00:28:39,971
You could thank F.E.M.A.

506
00:28:58,081 --> 00:28:59,176
Yo, man, what's up?

507
00:29:00,143 --> 00:29:01,014
Where is he?

508
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:04,249
Swimming.

509
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,231
What?

510
00:29:08,685 --> 00:29:10,141
Yeah, he was cool
till we got him here,

511
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:11,598
then he wouldn't
give us his gun.

512
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:15,063
So we took it from him.

513
00:29:16,091 --> 00:29:17,344
Oh, man!

514
00:29:20,621 --> 00:29:21,776
Oh, my god.

515
00:29:23,305 --> 00:29:24,920
Now I know
he's not the sheriff.

516
00:29:25,756 --> 00:29:27,855
But a deputy's
almost as good, right?

517
00:29:28,078 --> 00:29:29,344
Oh, come on, Lee!

518
00:29:30,248 --> 00:29:31,644
Man, what'd you do?

519
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,451
I told you we just wanted
to talk to the man,

520
00:29:33,452 --> 00:29:34,930
and this ain't even him.

521
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:36,429
Oh, chill, man, he's fine.

522
00:29:37,924 --> 00:29:39,039
Hey, deputy.

523
00:29:40,066 --> 00:29:42,505
If you can hear me,
raise your hand.

524
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,064
Honey!

525
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:14,948
Kira!

526
00:30:16,336 --> 00:30:18,707
- Is anybody here?
- Back here, dad.

527
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,480
Hey, Kira.
Have you seen your...

528
00:30:24,175 --> 00:30:27,037
- stepmother?
- She's at work, I think.

529
00:30:28,407 --> 00:30:29,681
What is all this?

530
00:30:31,099 --> 00:30:33,157
Does she know something
we don't?

531
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:52,067
We gotta get him
to the hospital!

532
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:57,434
Hey, Lee,
this is messed up, man.

533
00:30:58,098 --> 00:31:00,931
Where's his radio? His radio's not here!
What'd you do with it?

534
00:31:00,932 --> 00:31:02,549
- Beats me.
- Damn it!

535
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:05,191
- We don't need a radio.
- Don't need a phone, either.

536
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,733
hey! Hey! Stop!

537
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,340
Hey, man, stop it!
You stop it!

538
00:31:12,567 --> 00:31:14,687
Jeez, man, what the hell's
wrong with you?!

539
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,058
Oh, you want some? Huh?

540
00:31:18,054 --> 00:31:19,268
Back up, monkey.

541
00:31:19,742 --> 00:31:21,258
Back it up!

542
00:31:36,623 --> 00:31:37,555
Where's the radio?!

543
00:31:37,647 --> 00:31:38,691
Hey, man...

544
00:31:39,807 --> 00:31:41,846
- hey! Hey! Hey!
- Where's the damn radio?!

545
00:31:44,326 --> 00:31:47,206
Put it on channel one and call
my dad or stepdad, anybody!

546
00:31:48,084 --> 00:31:49,166
You come here!

547
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,976
- Where?
- Move!

548
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,614
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're going swimming!

549
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:56,091
You wanna
push people around?!

550
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:57,870
You want to
take over the world?!

551
00:31:57,970 --> 00:31:59,819
- I'm not one of them!
- I don't care!

552
00:32:02,895 --> 00:32:03,667
Jesse!

553
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:12,119
Jesse !!

554
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,617
How much of this
was Jesse?

555
00:32:22,763 --> 00:32:25,274
According to the other boys,
he tried to stop it.

556
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:31,271
How are they?

557
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,739
One of them
has a few broken ribs,

558
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,914
but he'll be all right.

559
00:32:41,533 --> 00:32:45,259
Russell may have
saved them all... Tom.

560
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:51,026
Is he still here?

561
00:32:52,076 --> 00:32:54,765
Yeah, he's in my office
with Jesse.

562
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:10,983
It's gonna get worse
before it gets better.

563
00:33:12,181 --> 00:33:13,300
I know.

564
00:33:13,301 --> 00:33:16,720
Water and batteries
won't help.

565
00:33:21,987 --> 00:33:23,794
They help me.

566
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,625
Kira.

567
00:33:57,025 --> 00:33:59,325
Everyone's gonna blame me
for this, aren't they?

568
00:33:59,989 --> 00:34:02,230
I can't speak
for anyone else.

569
00:34:04,130 --> 00:34:06,128
Do you?

570
00:34:09,455 --> 00:34:12,559
What did you think was
gonna happen tonight, Jess?

571
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:15,844
I don't know.

572
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:18,066
I guess...

573
00:34:21,723 --> 00:34:23,923
- I didn't care.
- Do you care now?

574
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:37,418
I'm sorry that
I haven't been around

575
00:34:37,419 --> 00:34:39,431
as much as you
need me to be.

576
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:43,763
And I'm really sorry about
what's happened to your mom.

577
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,063
But she's still your mom.

578
00:34:49,271 --> 00:34:50,867
And I'm still your dad.

579
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:54,746
And no matter what,
nothing's ever gonna change that, Jesse.

580
00:35:04,163 --> 00:35:07,296
She is still your mom.

581
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,124
Okay?

582
00:35:29,845 --> 00:35:32,589
I don't wanna
live here anymore, dad.

583
00:35:38,598 --> 00:35:40,355
Okay.

584
00:35:41,401 --> 00:35:42,626
Okay?

585
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,575
Yeah, I pretty such
got fired today, so...

586
00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:47,238
I'm up for anything.

587
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,830
I was actually thinking that
we should all take a trip.

588
00:35:54,293 --> 00:35:55,287
Where?

589
00:35:58,543 --> 00:36:00,120
Someplace dry.

590
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:06,971
Hey, Russ.

591
00:36:09,365 --> 00:36:10,852
Can I talk to you
for a second?

592
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:15,605
Hey, Tom, I'm, uh...

593
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:21,624
sorry about Lewis.

594
00:36:23,755 --> 00:36:25,311
I know you are, Jess.

595
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:27,915
Is he gonna be all right?

596
00:36:28,629 --> 00:36:31,000
Uh, that may be up to us.

597
00:36:32,247 --> 00:36:33,090
Russ?

598
00:36:38,617 --> 00:36:40,434
My turn to take you
for a ride tonight.

599
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,178
- Where are we going?
- Gas station.

600
00:36:43,572 --> 00:36:44,767
I want to show you something.

601
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,797
It's been like this
all day.

602
00:37:06,744 --> 00:37:08,099
They're all hybrids-

603
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:10,599
the people,
not the cars.

604
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:16,272
I got home tonight
and discovered

605
00:37:16,273 --> 00:37:19,944
that Mariel had packed the place
to the rafters with emergency supplies.

606
00:37:20,388 --> 00:37:21,915
So I called a few stores
around town,

607
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:25,502
and all the major outlets have run out of
water, tarps and batteries,

608
00:37:25,503 --> 00:37:26,652
so I drove to one of them.

609
00:37:26,653 --> 00:37:28,364
All hybrids there, too.

610
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,314
Is there
another hurricane coming?

611
00:37:32,485 --> 00:37:34,110
But nobody knows it.

612
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,103
People...

613
00:37:38,515 --> 00:37:40,886
are just feeling it.

614
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:45,667
These people
are feeling it.

615
00:37:46,644 --> 00:37:49,134
But it's the rest of the people
that I'm worried about.

616
00:37:50,723 --> 00:37:52,361
Szura's gone, Russell.

617
00:37:54,462 --> 00:37:55,958
I went out to that island
this morning,

618
00:37:55,959 --> 00:37:58,117
and he and his group,
they're just gone.

619
00:37:58,432 --> 00:38:00,168
Now I don't know
what he's planning.

620
00:38:01,085 --> 00:38:02,670
But if we get hit
with a storm-

621
00:38:03,525 --> 00:38:05,241
it's anything like eve was,

622
00:38:05,937 --> 00:38:07,954
everyone is
gonna be distracted.

623
00:38:09,855 --> 00:38:11,370
Why are you
telling me all this?

624
00:38:12,851 --> 00:38:15,218
Because I'm gonna
need your help to stop him.

625
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:18,748
What happened to Lewis
is gonna happen again

626
00:38:19,312 --> 00:38:21,671
till we find a way
to coexist.

627
00:38:22,477 --> 00:38:23,732
And right now...

628
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:28,405
I'm just a little short
on people I can trust.

629
00:38:37,008 --> 00:38:37,463
Yeah?

630
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:38,464
<i>Tom?</i>

631
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,351
It's him.

632
00:38:40,554 --> 00:38:41,597
where are you?

633
00:38:41,749 --> 00:38:42,822
In transit.

634
00:38:43,658 --> 00:38:45,532
There's some issues
I need to discuss with you.

635
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:48,014
Yeah, well, I got some issues
I need to discuss with you, too.

636
00:38:48,015 --> 00:38:49,059
Put it on speaker.

637
00:38:49,313 --> 00:38:50,547
<i>I had to leave the island.</i>

638
00:38:51,232 --> 00:38:53,611
That ranger
is a real pain in the ass.

639
00:38:53,612 --> 00:38:54,948
Where have you
taken everyone?

640
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,963
<i>I'd rather discuss this
in person.</i>

641
00:38:56,964 --> 00:38:58,400
<i>Could we meet
for breakfast tomorrow?</i>

642
00:39:01,988 --> 00:39:02,910
Eli...

643
00:39:02,911 --> 00:39:03,926
and, Tom...

644
00:39:05,475 --> 00:39:07,020
I know you're with him.

645
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,854
All right.

646
00:39:17,995 --> 00:39:19,954
What do you want to do?

647
00:39:27,861 --> 00:39:29,926
- Thank you, miss.
- You're welcome.

648
00:39:29,927 --> 00:39:32,193
- Is yours still not working?
- Afraid not.

649
00:39:32,816 --> 00:39:34,703
But it's nice to know
if I get in trouble again,

650
00:39:34,986 --> 00:39:36,753
you're always nearby.
