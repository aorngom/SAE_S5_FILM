1
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,409
All right, let's take a look.
That's not bad.

2
00:00:49,714 --> 00:00:50,776
That should hold for a while.

3
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:51,883
Where'd you get that door ?

4
00:00:52,154 --> 00:00:53,332
It's part of the original house.

5
00:00:54,135 --> 00:00:55,885
I took it off when I added the master bedroom.

6
00:00:56,842 --> 00:00:57,526
Here.

7
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,316
Thanks for your help,  son.

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,658
Yeah,  I don't know what I did,

9
00:01:00,659 --> 00:01:01,911
but you're welcome.

10
00:01:02,830 --> 00:01:05,342
Hey,  honey,  do you remember a guy named Vince Teracona ?

11
00:01:05,545 --> 00:01:06,951
Sounds like a race car driver.

12
00:01:07,107 --> 00:01:08,438
I met him when I first moved out here.

13
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:09,656
He was in the air force reserve.

14
00:01:10,807 --> 00:01:12,175
Yeah,  didn't you used to date him ?

15
00:01:12,682 --> 00:01:15,048
- He was more like a friend.
- Yeah,  she had a lot of friends.

16
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:16,725
Stop it.  I was thinking about calling him.

17
00:01:17,642 --> 00:01:19,625
Why ? You think he might know something

18
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:20,502
about that guy I found ?

19
00:01:20,503 --> 00:01:22,975
Well,  yeah-- Paxton,  the downed helicopter,

20
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:25,416
and that silver box I saw at the crash site.

21
00:01:25,688 --> 00:01:28,002
You think this one guy is gonna know about all that ?

22
00:01:28,003 --> 00:01:28,962
I don't know.
It's a long shot.

23
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,111
- But I figured if I could ask him a few questions. . .
- Daddy !

24
00:01:31,595 --> 00:01:33,040
Daddy,  you have to come see.

25
00:01:33,463 --> 00:01:34,188
What,  honey ?

26
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:36,058
One of the lights is in the water.

27
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:44,784
It was right there.

28
00:01:45,552 --> 00:01:46,966
What--what kind of lights,  Rose ?

29
00:01:47,199 --> 00:01:48,917
Like the ones I saw in the hurricane.

30
00:01:49,303 --> 00:01:51,091
Probably like the ones I saw with Kira in the mobile home.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,379
You know what they're talking about ?

32
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,198
- You shouldn't be down here,  okay,  Rose ?
- I was building a fort.

33
00:01:56,662 --> 00:01:58,148
Well,  let's build one closer to the house.

34
00:01:58,149 --> 00:01:59,058
- Wait a minute.
- Later.

35
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:11,651
All right,  why don't you draw up a plan for the fort,

36
00:02:11,728 --> 00:02:13,096
and we'll build it together ?

37
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,417
- I wanna know about the lights.
- You know as much as I do.

38
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:20,692
- But if they're bad--
- Honey,  honey,  just please draw me a fort.

39
00:02:23,438 --> 00:02:24,882
How long have you known about these things ?

40
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:27,480
- Since the day after the hurricane.
- And no one told me ?

41
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:29,468
Or him,  and he could've  gotten killed.

42
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:31,068
Hey,  I was almost killed, too,  okay ?

43
00:02:31,199 --> 00:02:32,693
I've been chasing around after the air force,

44
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,068
trying to find what they're looking for,

45
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:35,897
and all the while, you've known that there are lights--

46
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:37,537
we don't know anything.

47
00:02:37,844 --> 00:02:39,896
Rose saw some lights during the hurricane.

48
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:42,831
- And Dave got attacked by something in the water.
- That wasn't a gator.

49
00:02:42,917 --> 00:02:45,194
- And Jesse saw something,  too.
- What are they ?

50
00:02:45,354 --> 00:02:47,520
- Fish.
- Fish ?

51
00:02:47,642 --> 00:02:50,551
- That fell from the sky ?
- Bioluminescent fish,  yes,

52
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:51,844
that were tossed up by the hurricane.

53
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:54,630
Yeah,  or extraterrestrial biological entity

54
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,763
that the air force found and locked into a titanium box.

55
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:57,790
You decide.

56
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:00,611
What,  Russell ?

57
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,395
She said she saw them loading some mystery box
into the back of a semi.

58
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:04,889
What do you think was in there,  tuna ?

59
00:03:05,892 --> 00:03:08,441
- I just can't believe you didn't tell me about this.
- I was gonna tell you.

60
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:10,348
Dad,  why didn't you tell me about this ?

61
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:13,284
Probably could've saved mea  trip to the hospital.

62
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,305
Russell, someone's here !

63
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:26,481
- Hey,  Russ.
- Hey.

64
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,817
Sorry to bother you at home.

65
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:31,016
- I tried the radio, but there wasn't any answer.
- What's up,  Carl ?

66
00:03:31,175 --> 00:03:32,891
I was wondering,  are you going to flamingo today

67
00:03:32,892 --> 00:03:35,403
- to the damage assess meeting ?
- I don't know.  Why ?

68
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,162
Well,  I kind of wondered if maybe we could have lunch

69
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:38,037
or something.

70
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:39,262
Lunch ?

71
00:03:39,263 --> 00:03:40,681
Yeah,  I know, it sounds weird,

72
00:03:40,682 --> 00:03:43,686
but,  uh,  I don't know who else to talk to here.

73
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,058
Lucy and I are having some problems.

74
00:03:46,369 --> 00:03:48,689
And,  uh,  well,

75
00:03:49,304 --> 00:03:50,373
I know I mentioned it last week,

76
00:03:50,374 --> 00:03:52,545
but it's gettin 'kinda worse,  and,  um,

77
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:55,406
- I know you and Mariel, you had--
- Mariel and I aren't married anymore,  Carl.

78
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:56,551
Oh,  no,  no.  I know,  I know.

79
00:03:59,303 --> 00:04:00,136
But the thing is that--

80
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:02,390
- I'm going to see that guy,  Russell.
- Honey,  can you just wait a sec ?

81
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:03,455
- No.
- One sec  ?

82
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:06,314
Look,  Carl,  is it okay if we talk later ?

83
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:09,178
- Listen,  are you gonna come in at all today ?
- I don't know.  It's my day off.

84
00:04:09,179 --> 00:04:10,209
Hey,  Jesse,  where are you goin' ?

85
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:12,919
- For a walk.
- No,  stay here. I wanna talk to you.

86
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,486
Is that an order ?

87
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:15,099
Yeah.

88
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,929
Hey,  Larkin, please,  can you just wait ?

89
00:04:20,136 --> 00:04:21,246
- Damn it.
- Daddy !

90
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:24,623
Instead of a fort,
could we build a tree house ?

91
00:04:25,796 --> 00:04:27,240
This really isn't a good time,  Carl.

92
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,649
- Yeah,  but will I see you at flamingo ?
- I don't know.

93
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,285
I don't know,  but if not today,
tomorrow,  okay ?

94
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,388
Yeah.

95
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:35,331
Yeah.

96
00:04:36,413 --> 00:04:37,244
Sure.

97
00:04:42,812 --> 00:04:43,646
Mariel.

98
00:04:44,986 --> 00:04:45,819
Morning.

99
00:04:46,167 --> 00:04:47,267
Morning,  father.

100
00:04:48,796 --> 00:04:49,595
Meat loaf ?

101
00:04:50,213 --> 00:04:51,885
Yeah.  My attempt at a family dinner.

102
00:04:53,723 --> 00:04:55,127
I've been meaning to talk to you.

103
00:04:55,818 --> 00:04:57,682
I heard you had a rough night in the hurricane.

104
00:04:58,297 --> 00:04:59,015
So did I.

105
00:05:00,058 --> 00:05:02,413
We've started a survivor's group at the church

106
00:05:02,534 --> 00:05:03,491
if you're interested.

107
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:04,827
A survivor's group ?

108
00:05:04,982 --> 00:05:06,740
Yeah,  it's for people who've had

109
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,043
an especially traumatic experience.

110
00:05:11,222 --> 00:05:13,277
This is a nondenominational thing,

111
00:05:13,859 --> 00:05:15,377
purely extracurricular.

112
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:17,629
Just neighbors reaching out to neighbors,

113
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:19,238
trying to help them transition.

114
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:21,175
Transition to what ?

115
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,501
Oh,  thank you.

116
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:25,062
Who leness.

117
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,548
I'm sure you've hads ome conflicted feelings

118
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,264
since your ordeal. I know I have.

119
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:30,313
Well,  thank you,  father.

120
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,615
Um,  but I'd like to discuss this with my husband first.

121
00:05:34,874 --> 00:05:36,624
Oh,  Tom's all for it.

122
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:40,353
As a matter of fact,
he's the one who suggested I invite you.

123
00:06:03,057 --> 00:06:03,928
What's up,  Lewis ?

124
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:06,107
Owner got back from lunch,  found a looter inside.

125
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,086
A looter ? You didn' thave to call me for this.

126
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:11,328
When we tried to gain entry,
the suspect threatened to shoot.

127
00:06:11,485 --> 00:06:13,421
Said he wouldn't come out unless he talked to you. . .

128
00:06:14,266 --> 00:06:15,061
alone.

129
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:16,212
Really ?

130
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:19,955
I wouldn't go in by yourself,  sir.

131
00:06:19,956 --> 00:06:21,634
It's all right,  Lewis. Just keep the car running.

132
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,030
Don't you want a flashlight,  sir ?

133
00:07:43,455 --> 00:07:44,559
You wanted to see me ?

134
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:45,588
Sheriff.

135
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,620
Put down the gun, Carl.

136
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,238
- No,  not until you tell me what's goin' on.
- There's nothing to tell.

137
00:07:52,326 --> 00:07:54,039
You're breaking and entering.
Put down the gun.

138
00:07:54,272 --> 00:07:55,182
I need it.

139
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:56,669
The owner needs it more.

140
00:07:57,741 --> 00:07:58,512
Put it down.

141
00:07:58,513 --> 00:08:03,083
Why didn't you help me ? !
You could a helped me.

142
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:07,656
All right, you want a tree house,
you are gonna get a tree house.

143
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:11,248
- But it's so close to the house.
- Well,  we like close.

144
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,296
- Close is good,  isn't it,  Dave ?
- Yeah.

145
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:16,245
Hey,  so you got a plan for this thing ?

146
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:19,516
You wanna go round,  square,
one,  two platforms,  what ?

147
00:08:19,517 --> 00:08:22,829
Um,  let's go two platforms,
a ladder and a rope swing.

148
00:08:23,404 --> 00:08:25,268
- You want a rope swing ?
- Sure.

149
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,641
All right.  You're gonna geta rope swing.

150
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,895
But you're not goin' down by that water anymore.

151
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,755
At least not until we figure out what's in there.

152
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,003
Right,  Rose ?

153
00:08:34,849 --> 00:08:35,832
Right.

154
00:08:38,544 --> 00:08:40,750
Okay.  All right, uncle Dave,  take over.

155
00:08:40,983 --> 00:08:42,466
Uh,  yeah.  Okay.

156
00:08:55,557 --> 00:08:56,894
Hey,  Jess,  it's dad.

157
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,879
Son.

158
00:09:05,132 --> 00:09:06,273
Will you take those off ?

159
00:09:09,402 --> 00:09:11,380
Look,  I'm sorry that I didn't tell you
what was going on.

160
00:09:12,415 --> 00:09:13,821
I just didn't want to scare anybody.

161
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,757
I wouldn't have been scared.
I woulda been interested.

162
00:09:18,176 --> 00:09:18,966
I know.

163
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,505
- You really think it's a fish ?
- Yeah.

164
00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:31,546
Granted,  one that probably doesn't belong here.

165
00:09:31,969 --> 00:09:33,528
- You think it's an alien ?
- No.

166
00:09:35,285 --> 00:09:36,392
Me either.

167
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:45,473
All right.  I'm gonna get back out to work.

168
00:09:50,108 --> 00:09:50,885
Hey,  dad.

169
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:55,041
- Do I have to stay at mom's tonight ?
- Yeah.

170
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:56,598
Well,  I don't want to.
I want to stay here.

171
00:09:56,983 --> 00:09:58,782
Well,  you know I'd love to,
but it's your mom's day.

172
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,913
- I know she's gonna want to see you.
- But I don't see her.

173
00:10:01,069 --> 00:10:02,748
Since the hurricane, she's hardly ever home,

174
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:05,034
and when she is,  it's like she's not there anyway.

175
00:10:05,418 --> 00:10:06,823
Hey,  Russ,  Russ.

176
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:08,924
Some deputy wants to talk to you.

177
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:14,218
Yeah.

178
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:23,701
They're inside.

179
00:10:41,753 --> 00:10:42,815
<i>I really don't know what he wanted. </i>

180
00:10:43,783 --> 00:10:45,570
<i>He just drew the gun on me so fast. </i>

181
00:10:52,434 --> 00:10:53,306
Tom.

182
00:10:53,808 --> 00:10:54,681
Hey.

183
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,120
- How did this happen ?
- Maybe you can tell me.

187
00:11:12,486 --> 00:11:14,309
So you said he came over to see you this morning.

188
00:11:14,354 --> 00:11:18,009
Yeah,  he wanted to talk, have lunch.

189
00:11:19,998 --> 00:11:21,823
Any idea why he might have done this ?

190
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,151
He said he was having problems at home.

191
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,100
Have you talked to Lucy ?

192
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,440
- Who ?
- His wife.

193
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,652
No.  No,  not yet.

194
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:32,092
We have a couple of deputies on the way to the house right now.

195
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:33,961
Damn it !

196
00:11:34,978 --> 00:11:37,430
- Were you close with the family ?
- Used to be.

197
00:11:37,536 --> 00:11:40,277
When Mariel and I were married,
we hung out quite a bit.

198
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:43,785
Why didn't I talk to him ?

199
00:11:43,786 --> 00:11:45,271
Sheriff, here's your backup.

200
00:11:51,298 --> 00:11:53,929
The gun that was fired has been impounded pending investigation.

201
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:56,674
- Will there be an investigation ?
- Of course.

202
00:11:56,689 --> 00:11:57,827
You had no choice,  sir.

203
00:11:59,588 --> 00:12:00,877
You always have a choice, Lewis.

204
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:03,896
You just have to be sure you make the right one.

205
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:08,355
Thanks.

206
00:12:16,618 --> 00:12:20,043
<i>all vehicles must display a D. O. D.  Security tag at all times. </i>

207
00:12:24,928 --> 00:12:26,141
Can I have some I. D. , Ma'am ?

208
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:28,771
I'm here to see master sergeant Vince teracona.

209
00:12:29,035 --> 00:12:30,385
Do you know what unit he's with,  ma'am ?

210
00:12:30,386 --> 00:12:32,373
- Civil engineering offices.
- Okay.

211
00:12:32,493 --> 00:12:35,154
Clear ! That'll be straight down on your right,  ma'am.

212
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,758
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

213
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:07,216
- Larkin.
- Vince.

214
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,657
- How are you ?
- Awesome.

215
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:11,642
How are you,  mama ?

216
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:13,888
Be careful.  You might get my breakfast in your lap.

217
00:13:14,849 --> 00:13:17,891
Wow.  You look awesome.

218
00:13:18,128 --> 00:13:19,265
You don't look fatat all.

219
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:20,684
thanks.

220
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,596
I-I'm so glad you called.

221
00:13:23,943 --> 00:13:25,584
You know, nobody ever believes me when I tell them

222
00:13:25,585 --> 00:13:27,985
I used to date Larkin groves of the channel 7 I-team.

223
00:13:28,368 --> 00:13:29,704
What does the "I"stand for anyways ?

224
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:31,813
Is it like eye "I" or just I "I" ?

225
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:34,854
Just "I" for investigation.

226
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,560
Oh,  well,  I hope you're not investigating me today.

227
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:39,850
Not unless you have something to hide.

228
00:13:41,647 --> 00:13:42,592
Our chariot awaits.

229
00:13:52,928 --> 00:13:56,169
<i>the sheriff's office has confirmed
it was indeed Tom Underlay</i>

230
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,001
<i>in this officer-involved shooting. . . </i>

231
00:14:01,247 --> 00:14:01,965
Hey,  Kira.

232
00:14:02,923 --> 00:14:06,655
- Have you heard about this ?
- Yes.  It's all over the radio.

233
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,048
- Has your father called in ?
- No.

234
00:14:10,319 --> 00:14:11,803
<i>The victim was ranger Carl mckittrick, </i>

235
00:14:11,921 --> 00:14:14,742
<i>a native of homestead,  a 12-year veteran of. . . </i>

236
00:14:14,743 --> 00:14:16,036
your friends with his son,  aren't you ?

237
00:14:16,613 --> 00:14:17,333
Yeah.

238
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:19,047
What am I gonna say to him ?

239
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,448
Sorry my dad killed your dad ?

240
00:14:24,122 --> 00:14:25,077
Tom ?

241
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:29,310
- Tom,  is that you ?
- Sorry,  it's just me.

242
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,426
- I came by to get some clothes.
- Clothes,  for what ? Come here.

243
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:36,437
For what ?

244
00:14:37,433 --> 00:14:38,724
I want to stay at dad's tonight.

245
00:14:39,532 --> 00:14:40,252
No.

246
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:42,238
No.  Tonight's our night.

247
00:14:42,392 --> 00:14:44,873
Mom,  it's not really gonna be that great of a night,  is it ?

248
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:45,786
What does that mean ?

249
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:47,974
- Have you seen the news ?
- Yes.

250
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,118
It kinda sucks.

251
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,360
Jesse. Jesse,  come here.

252
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:53,731
Come here.

253
00:14:57,047 --> 00:14:58,267
Now I want you to be here.

254
00:14:58,272 --> 00:14:59,340
Under the circumstances,

255
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:01,627
I think we need to be together as a family.

256
00:15:01,857 --> 00:15:06,284
- I don't want to be here tonight.
- Why ?

257
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:12,538
Hey,  Kira.

258
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:16,320
Jesse.

259
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,608
- Jesse !
- What ? !

260
00:15:25,741 --> 00:15:26,538
Jesse.

261
00:15:29,408 --> 00:15:30,548
I'll talk to him.

262
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,639
Russell.

263
00:15:49,093 --> 00:15:49,966
Hey.

264
00:15:53,325 --> 00:15:55,453
Oh,  Lucy.  I'm so sorry.

265
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:01,553
do you want some coffee ?It's still hot.

266
00:16:02,168 --> 00:16:03,233
The deputies just left.

267
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,854
Honey,  do you remembermr.  Varon ?

268
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:13,486
Hey,  Gage.

269
00:16:14,215 --> 00:16:15,165
Hey.

270
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:17,948
I'm sorry about your dad.

271
00:16:20,276 --> 00:16:21,188
Thanks.

272
00:16:25,156 --> 00:16:26,563
It's sweet of you to come by,  Russell.

273
00:16:27,485 --> 00:16:29,192
I'm sure a lot of people must have--

274
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:31,099
must have called, but with the phones out. . .

275
00:16:31,522 --> 00:16:32,777
yeah,  Lucy,  uh,

276
00:16:33,355 --> 00:16:35,482
Carl came to see methis morning.

277
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:39,294
Why ?

278
00:16:41,357 --> 00:16:42,883
Um. . .  I guess he wanted to talk.

279
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:45,139
He said you two were having problems.

280
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:51,809
- Was he sober ?
- I think so.

281
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:56,764
He didn't own a gun, you know ?

282
00:16:58,904 --> 00:17:02,252
- I'm sure that's why he broke into that place.
- To steal a gun ?

283
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:05,879
Things with us haven't been good
for a long time,  Russell.

284
00:17:06,342 --> 00:17:08,852
But since the hurricane, it has just been insane.

285
00:17:09,473 --> 00:17:11,798
<i>Carl was drinking a lot, he'd gotten very abusive--</i>

286
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:13,671
<i>physically abusive. </i>

287
00:17:14,423 --> 00:17:16,067
I-I can't believe that.

288
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:18,698
He was very depressed, angry.

289
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:21,925
<i>I just don't think he wanted
the burden of a family anymore.</i>

290
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:25,170
Last night I told him I wanted a divorce,
and he went crazy.

291
00:17:26,967 --> 00:17:28,496
I finally had to call the sheriff.

292
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,148
Sheriff Underlay ?

293
00:17:33,989 --> 00:17:37,235
If he hadn't shown up,
I don't know what might have happened.

294
00:17:37,399 --> 00:17:38,958
The sheriff said he didn't know you.

295
00:17:40,681 --> 00:17:43,045
I mean,  if Carl had a gun last night,
I don't know,  I just. . .

296
00:17:45,153 --> 00:17:46,332
<i>you wouldn't have recognized him. </i>

297
00:17:46,674 --> 00:17:49,261
<i>He wasn't the same person. I couldn't. . . </i>

298
00:17:52,468 --> 00:17:54,067
Jesse,  will you just wait for me a sec ?

299
00:17:54,413 --> 00:17:55,981
I waited all night for you,  Kira,

300
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,087
while you and that. . .

301
00:17:59,161 --> 00:17:59,993
whatever.

302
00:18:00,303 --> 00:18:01,405
I hope it was worth it.

303
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:03,539
- Nothing happened.
- Yeah,  right.

304
00:18:04,115 --> 00:18:05,599
Is that why you don't want to be at our house,

305
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,436
'cause of me ?

306
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:08,916
I just wanna help out my dad,  okay ?

307
00:18:09,684 --> 00:18:13,492
- What about your mom ?
- What about her ?

308
00:18:13,763 --> 00:18:16,471
- She's really upset.
- She'll be fine.

309
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:17,995
Look,  I know she's not perfect,

310
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:19,673
but she's doing the best she can,  okay ?

311
00:18:19,674 --> 00:18:21,578
We all are. At least you have a mom.

312
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,807
You're right.

313
00:18:29,052 --> 00:18:29,848
Jesse. . .

314
00:18:31,835 --> 00:18:33,508
will you come with me to see Gage ?

315
00:18:34,048 --> 00:18:35,348
I wouldn't know what to say to him.

316
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,256
I don't know what to say to him either.

317
00:18:42,061 --> 00:18:42,860
All right.

318
00:18:51,643 --> 00:18:52,630
Shoot !

319
00:19:07,851 --> 00:19:09,141
- Hey,  Russell.
- Hey,  Mariel.

320
00:19:10,138 --> 00:19:10,896
What's up ?

321
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:13,832
- Did you hear about Carl ?
- Yeah.

322
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:16,314
It's awful.

323
00:19:18,609 --> 00:19:19,527
Come in.

324
00:19:25,021 --> 00:19:25,780
You all right ?

325
00:19:27,042 --> 00:19:27,762
Yeah.

326
00:19:29,449 --> 00:19:30,012
No.

327
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,948
actually,  I should go grab a band-aid.

328
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:36,607
Is Tom home ?

329
00:19:37,186 --> 00:19:37,981
No.

330
00:19:38,748 --> 00:19:41,069
- Have you talked to Lucy ?
- I just saw her.

331
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:42,823
How is she ?

332
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:44,966
Not good.

333
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,781
You know,  apparently,  she and Carl
have been having problems.

334
00:19:50,158 --> 00:19:50,879
Finally.

335
00:19:51,417 --> 00:19:52,558
Sorry,  Russell, can this wait ?

336
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:54,387
- Can what wait ?
- Where have you been ?

337
00:19:57,289 --> 00:19:58,542
I've been trying to reach you all morning.

338
00:19:58,852 --> 00:20:00,109
I've been trying to reach you,  too.

339
00:20:00,951 --> 00:20:02,090
You're on the wrong channel,  honey.

340
00:20:03,809 --> 00:20:05,101
just dropping offt he kids,  Russ ?

341
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:08,227
No,  I just saw Lucy mckittrick.

342
00:20:10,747 --> 00:20:11,924
Honey,  can you give us a minute ?

343
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:13,192
Tom. . .

344
00:20:15,676 --> 00:20:17,158
- I need to talk to you.
- Just a minute.

345
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:33,195
I'm sorry if this is a bad time.

346
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,648
It's a bad day. What's up ?

347
00:20:36,022 --> 00:20:37,849
Why didn't you tell me you were
at Carl's house last night ?

348
00:20:38,729 --> 00:20:40,222
I asked you if you knew Lucy, you said no.

349
00:20:40,223 --> 00:20:42,163
- What difference does it make ?
- You could've arrested him.

350
00:20:42,206 --> 00:20:43,615
She said he was beating her up pretty bad.

351
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:45,564
Russell,  do you know how many domestic dispute calls

352
00:20:45,565 --> 00:20:46,978
I've had since the hurricane ?

353
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:50,149
People are comin' apart at the seams.

354
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:53,123
No water,  no power--

355
00:20:53,241 --> 00:20:54,654
if I arrested every guyt hat looked like

356
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:56,112
he was about to go off the deep end,

357
00:20:56,113 --> 00:20:57,718
that would be about half this town.

358
00:20:58,752 --> 00:21:00,272
I made a judgment call last night.

359
00:21:01,234 --> 00:21:03,208
I thought the situation was contained.

360
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:06,228
Obviously,  I was wrong.

361
00:21:08,064 --> 00:21:09,813
But why are you the one that seems so guilty ?

362
00:21:11,954 --> 00:21:12,863
He was my friend.

363
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:16,943
Your friend tried to kill me.

364
00:21:24,021 --> 00:21:25,882
And we both had a chanceto help him,
but we didn't.

365
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:29,507
The only difference is you knew
how dangerous the situation was.

366
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:32,023
I'm sorry I called you.

367
00:21:34,009 --> 00:21:36,597
- I'm not gonna leave this alone,  Tom.
- You do what you have to do.

368
00:21:36,945 --> 00:21:38,427
I'm not gonna let this go.

369
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,124
So how's married life ?

370
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:58,951
You've been hitched now, what,  almost a year ?

371
00:21:58,952 --> 00:22:01,504
- Yeah,  a year in november.
- And it's great ?It's all great ?

372
00:22:02,424 --> 00:22:03,369
It's pretty great.

373
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:06,077
What about you,  Vince ?

374
00:22:06,122 --> 00:22:07,643
You,  uh,  you where you wanna be ?

375
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:09,895
Well,  I'm a senior master sergeant now,

376
00:22:09,896 --> 00:22:11,996
so I'm pretty much in charge of this place.

377
00:22:12,162 --> 00:22:14,524
- You run the base ?
- No.  No,  no,  no.

378
00:22:14,525 --> 00:22:15,938
That'd be the air base wing commander.

379
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:17,419
But anything maintenance related,

380
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:20,667
every structure, all operations--that's me.

381
00:22:21,054 --> 00:22:21,817
Hey,  you wouldn't know anything

382
00:22:21,818 --> 00:22:23,461
about a downed helicopter, would you ?

383
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,986
Or a missing weather plane, anything like that ?

384
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:27,242
Downed helicopter ?

385
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:28,617
You tryin' to give usa bad name ?

386
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:32,243
Hold on now.

387
00:22:32,244 --> 00:22:33,803
We're entering a special clearance area.

388
00:22:35,216 --> 00:22:36,247
What goes on in there ?

389
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,890
Oh,  that's an O. S. I.  Hangar.

390
00:22:38,167 --> 00:22:39,623
Officeof special investigations.

391
00:22:39,967 --> 00:22:41,756
They don't let mere mortals anywhere near there.

392
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,493
But if you'd like to see the weather facility,
I could arrange that.

393
00:22:45,536 --> 00:22:47,442
And they got a great little lunch spot right next door.

394
00:22:47,443 --> 00:22:48,355
- Sound good ?
- Yeah.

395
00:22:49,349 --> 00:22:52,435
Two hamburgers and some freedom fries coming up.

396
00:22:58,371 --> 00:22:59,130
Where you going ?

397
00:23:01,537 --> 00:23:02,484
To see the priest.

398
00:23:05,654 --> 00:23:06,718
Isn't that what you want ?

399
00:23:08,016 --> 00:23:08,929
The priest ?

400
00:23:08,935 --> 00:23:11,827
Yeah,  I bumped into father Scanlon
at the market this morning.

401
00:23:14,501 --> 00:23:16,861
He said you wanted me to join his survivor's group.

402
00:23:17,627 --> 00:23:19,032
Be nice if you had talked to me about it.

403
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:21,282
But maybe you discussed it with Russell instead.

404
00:23:21,556 --> 00:23:22,237
Mariel.

405
00:23:22,546 --> 00:23:24,580
I've been worried sick about you all morning,  Tom,

406
00:23:24,625 --> 00:23:27,063
and you come home and just dismiss me.

407
00:23:27,446 --> 00:23:30,071
I didn't dismiss you. I--what--

408
00:23:30,952 --> 00:23:32,129
how do you feel aboutwhat happened ?

409
00:23:32,937 --> 00:23:35,142
I feel confused and. . .

410
00:23:36,405 --> 00:23:37,087
by what ?

411
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:39,800
- You killed somebody.
- I know.

412
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:43,348
- So why aren't you more upset about it ?
- I am.

413
00:23:44,046 --> 00:23:46,824
Doesn't seem like it. You don't seem upset at all.

414
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:49,198
- Why aren't you upset ?
- Because I knew it was gonna happen.

415
00:23:54,195 --> 00:23:56,138
You knew what was gonna happen ?

416
00:23:56,373 --> 00:23:58,163
From the moment I walked into that place this morning,

417
00:23:58,164 --> 00:24:00,372
I knew that that guy was gonna be dead.

418
00:24:01,759 --> 00:24:04,005
I don't know why, I don't know how,
I just knew.

419
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,340
Like I know a lot of things.

420
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:14,007
Do you know how your wife
is feeling right now ?

421
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,279
Alone.

422
00:24:58,233 --> 00:24:59,113
Mariel.

423
00:25:01,748 --> 00:25:02,926
Hey,  father.

424
00:25:03,274 --> 00:25:05,059
Our meeting's not until 7:00.

425
00:25:05,753 --> 00:25:08,188
I was. . . in the neighborhood.

426
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:12,236
I heard about what happened this morning.

427
00:25:13,576 --> 00:25:14,600
Is Tom all right ?

428
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:18,796
I think he will be.

429
00:25:22,612 --> 00:25:24,361
Did you know mr.  Mckittrick ?

430
00:25:25,091 --> 00:25:26,003
I know his wife.

431
00:25:26,923 --> 00:25:27,839
It's very sad.

432
00:25:29,754 --> 00:25:30,661
Yes.

433
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:32,651
Who lives and who dies--

434
00:25:32,696 --> 00:25:36,087
it all seems so random, doesn't it ?

435
00:25:37,309 --> 00:25:38,679
It's not,  of course.

436
00:25:41,237 --> 00:25:42,072
Are you sure ?

437
00:25:44,249 --> 00:25:45,464
Who are you talking to ?

438
00:25:48,478 --> 00:25:49,474
What's wrong,  Mariel ?

439
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:53,667
I,  um. . .

440
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:57,864
I'm worried about my family.

441
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,143
My son Jesse--

442
00:26:02,947 --> 00:26:04,429
I don't know if you remember him.

443
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,756
I don't think he wants to live with me anymore.

444
00:26:13,585 --> 00:26:15,828
Since the hurricane,

445
00:26:16,371 --> 00:26:19,299
I. . .  haven't beenas attentive.

446
00:26:23,269 --> 00:26:24,712
I've been very distracted.

447
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,920
And Tom is just so. . .

448
00:26:32,689 --> 00:26:34,247
hard to reach sometimes.

449
00:26:41,952 --> 00:26:44,852
Did I tell you I was from minnesota ?

450
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,030
Did you know that ?

451
00:26:49,885 --> 00:26:50,947
No.

452
00:26:51,221 --> 00:26:52,397
Well,  I am.

453
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:53,884
When I was a kid,

454
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:57,544
I used to do a lot of skiing,
but I was never very good

455
00:26:57,969 --> 00:27:02,425
because I was always so busy
trying to hang onto the mountain.

456
00:27:03,194 --> 00:27:04,943
Don't fall down, don't fall down--

457
00:27:05,025 --> 00:27:06,738
that's all I kept telling myself.

458
00:27:08,304 --> 00:27:10,014
So,  of course, that's all I kept doing.

459
00:27:14,939 --> 00:27:16,574
I can't let go of my family.

460
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:17,640
You don't have to.

461
00:27:19,859 --> 00:27:22,254
If Jesse wants to live with his dad for a while,

462
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:23,440
let him.

463
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:25,540
Russell's not perfect.

464
00:27:27,752 --> 00:27:29,644
Jesse may start to appreciate you more

465
00:27:30,078 --> 00:27:31,598
if he has some time away.

466
00:27:36,103 --> 00:27:37,129
And Tom ?

467
00:27:39,535 --> 00:27:40,988
You're never going to lose him.

468
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:44,837
Ever.

469
00:27:51,363 --> 00:27:52,350
Does he come here ?

470
00:27:53,117 --> 00:27:53,803
No.

471
00:27:55,291 --> 00:27:57,652
But I'd be happy to invite him if you'd like me to.

472
00:27:59,181 --> 00:28:02,157
And. . .  if that meat loaf will keep a day,

473
00:28:04,177 --> 00:28:05,315
I hope you'll join us.

474
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:15,978
okay.

475
00:28:15,979 --> 00:28:17,959
Are we going to have to do this all by ourselves ?

476
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,326
Yeah,  I guess we are.

477
00:28:20,749 --> 00:28:22,765
I thought daddy and Jesse were going to help.

478
00:28:23,077 --> 00:28:25,548
Well,  they were a little bit busy.

479
00:28:26,926 --> 00:28:27,762
But you know what ?

480
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,241
- We can do it on our own,  right ?
- We can.

481
00:28:30,398 --> 00:28:31,346
Yeah,  we can.

482
00:28:32,839 --> 00:28:33,835
Hey,  what was that,  uh. . .

483
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,962
what was that spanish songy ou were singing earlier ?

484
00:28:37,196 --> 00:28:38,606
"Señora santana" ?

485
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:39,869
Yeah.  What is that ?

486
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:42,051
Señora santana,

487
00:28:42,287 --> 00:28:44,110
por qué llora el niño ?

488
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:46,094
No,  I mean in english, what does it mean ?

489
00:28:46,409 --> 00:28:48,918
It's about a boy who's crying 'cause he lost his apple.

490
00:28:49,234 --> 00:28:50,146
How'd he lose his apple ?

491
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:51,061
I don't know,

492
00:28:51,219 --> 00:28:52,512
but señora santana

493
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,883
tries to give him a new one,

494
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:55,676
and he doesn't want that one.

495
00:28:56,407 --> 00:28:57,851
He wants the one he lost.

496
00:28:58,246 --> 00:29:00,567
Yeah.  I think a lot of guys can relate to that.

497
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:03,502
Keep singing that song. Come on.

498
00:29:13,497 --> 00:29:15,283
oh,  yeah, keep that rhythm strong.

499
00:29:18,247 --> 00:29:18,779
Here we are.

500
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,211
This'll just take a second,  Larkin.

501
00:29:26,716 --> 00:29:28,122
See ? It's weather world.

502
00:29:29,577 --> 00:29:31,861
You can plan your next vacation here.

503
00:29:32,512 --> 00:29:33,497
Just give me two minutes,  okay ?

504
00:29:33,657 --> 00:29:34,571
But you gotta stay here.

505
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:35,485
You got it.

506
00:30:09,032 --> 00:30:10,932
Take it to the pine island visitors' center in the park.

507
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:11,659
Okay.

508
00:30:12,082 --> 00:30:12,809
Thanks.

509
00:30:18,268 --> 00:30:20,570
Hey,  deputy. Were there cameras inside ?

510
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:21,779
Was there a generator, by chance ?

511
00:30:21,781 --> 00:30:22,474
No,  sir.

512
00:30:23,251 --> 00:30:24,618
So no one witnessed the shooting ?

513
00:30:24,927 --> 00:30:28,508
No,  sir. At the suspect's request,
the sheriff went in alone.

514
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:32,474
Carl asked to see Underlay ?

515
00:30:32,975 --> 00:30:33,810
Yes,  sir.

516
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:37,544
Thank you.

517
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:02,179
Gage ?

518
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:05,036
- Hi.
- Hey.

519
00:31:07,292 --> 00:31:08,545
What are you doing here ?

520
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:13,835
- Whoa,  wait a second.
- What do you want ?

521
00:31:15,952 --> 00:31:17,090
To apologize.

522
00:31:18,352 --> 00:31:20,635
I had no idea what was goin' on in your house.

523
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:23,152
You still have no idea.

524
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,661
Yeah,  well,  maybe not, but. . .

525
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,916
I'm sorry.

526
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,204
You know,  your dad was always a good friend to me.

527
00:31:33,202 --> 00:31:35,218
If you ever need to talk, about anything. . .

528
00:31:36,213 --> 00:31:40,976
You know what my mom told you about. . .
my father abusing her ?

529
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,035
It's total garbage.

530
00:31:44,565 --> 00:31:46,203
She was the one beating on him.

531
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:50,015
If he needed a gun,
it was only to protect himself.

532
00:31:52,918 --> 00:31:54,439
Ever since they pulled her out of the water,

533
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,193
she's been like a completely different person.

534
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:00,284
We lost mom the night eve hit.

535
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:05,124
Red cross found her, but she didn't come back the same.

536
00:32:08,905 --> 00:32:10,655
He just wanted her to be the same.

537
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:18,052
Gage.

538
00:32:50,305 --> 00:32:51,099
Gage.

539
00:32:51,601 --> 00:32:52,519
You following me ?

540
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:55,492
- I came to talk to your mom.
- She's not here.

541
00:32:56,753 --> 00:32:57,397
Where is she ?

542
00:32:58,356 --> 00:33:00,720
I don't know. Probably at the church
where she always is now.

543
00:33:01,141 --> 00:33:01,783
The church ?

544
00:33:02,629 --> 00:33:04,074
Hurricane survivors group.

545
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,021
Her new family.

546
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,234
- Where you goin' ?
- To my uncle's.

547
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:15,247
My mom doesn't want me here anymore.

548
00:33:16,474 --> 00:33:18,488
Wait a minute, you're movin' out,  today ?

549
00:33:19,638 --> 00:33:20,663
She didn't want my dad,

550
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,113
and now she doesn't want me.

551
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:27,034
Say hello to your son for me.

552
00:36:06,537 --> 00:36:08,708
Man,  you are a dog with a bone today, aren't you ?

553
00:36:08,751 --> 00:36:11,347
- What are you doing here,  Tom ?
- Selling bibles. What are you doing ?

554
00:36:11,696 --> 00:36:13,141
You know,  I talked to your deputy today.

555
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,659
I know you did.  I also know you talked to the kid.

556
00:36:15,663 --> 00:36:18,253
Tell me,  are you working as
an official ranger detective now ?

557
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:19,816
Carl asked to see you this morning.

558
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:22,990
Was it because he was concerned about his wife ?

559
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,163
About what happened to her in the hurricane ?

560
00:36:25,206 --> 00:36:27,881
Like I said earlier, there'll be a full investigation
into the shooting.

561
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:29,445
I'm not talking about the shooting,  Tom.

562
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:31,359
I'm asking you if you know--

563
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,300
specifically--what happened to Lucy.

564
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:38,644
I mean,  you protected her at Carl's expense.  Why ?

565
00:36:41,853 --> 00:36:43,108
Why,  is it because she's part of this ?

566
00:36:44,217 --> 00:36:46,043
Is that what it is, because she's a survivor ?

567
00:36:47,003 --> 00:36:48,416
What the hell does that mean,  Tom ?

568
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,087
What is happening to all these people ?

569
00:36:55,361 --> 00:36:56,193
Oh,  no.

570
00:37:06,305 --> 00:37:07,676
She shouldn't be here.

571
00:37:09,459 --> 00:37:10,535
She belongs here.

572
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:15,149
I take care of my loved ones.

573
00:37:15,764 --> 00:37:17,362
Maybe you oughta think about doin' the same.

574
00:37:33,611 --> 00:37:38,594
- Well,  thanks, Vince.  For the tour.
- I'm just glad we're able to see each other again

575
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:40,233
- Take care of that baby,  huh  ?
- Yeah.

576
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,751
- Bye,  babe.
- Bye.

577
00:38:07,192 --> 00:38:09,254
<i>As those of you who've been with us before know, </i>

578
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,623
this is a place where people come together
to tell their stories of survival.

579
00:38:14,707 --> 00:38:17,408
And hopefully,  find greater meaningin our lives.

580
00:38:19,091 --> 00:38:23,396
But with the blessings of a second chance
come greater responsibilities.

581
00:38:24,392 --> 00:38:27,905
And nobody knows that better
than sheriff Tom Underlay.

582
00:38:37,847 --> 00:38:40,133
Did you know your husband was gonna talk tonight ?

583
00:38:40,824 --> 00:38:41,544
No.

584
00:38:43,573 --> 00:38:47,115
Unlike most of you,  who've endured
the trauma of a hurricane,

585
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:49,821
my story goes back a few years.

586
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,765
It's a story that some of you know. . .

587
00:38:52,953 --> 00:38:54,208
but for those of you who don't,

588
00:38:55,547 --> 00:38:58,862
in 1996,  my wife and I. . .

589
00:39:01,951 --> 00:39:02,979
my first wife--

590
00:39:04,132 --> 00:39:09,583
were on a flight to atlanta to visit her sister
when I heard a loud,  popping sound.

591
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:11,223
<i>It was 2:10 in the afternoon. </i>

592
00:39:12,314 --> 00:39:16,821
<i>In the next three minutes, the plane banked
and headed back toward miami.</i>

593
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:19,753
<i>But the cabinfilled with smoke. </i>

594
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,293
<i>53 seconds later,  the plane dropped 6, 000 feet. . . </i>

595
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,923
<i>crashed into the everglades</i>

596
00:39:28,187 --> 00:39:30,475
<i>and spread debrisover a solid square mile. </i>

597
00:39:35,816 --> 00:39:37,068
At this point,  I--

598
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,509
I really don't rememberwhat happened.

599
00:39:41,688 --> 00:39:44,470
They tell me that they immediately
called off the search for survivors,

600
00:39:44,472 --> 00:39:46,910
that it was impossible for anyone to live through the crash.

601
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:52,211
<i>They also tell me that 19 hours later. . . </i>

602
00:39:54,008 --> 00:39:56,062
<i>two rescuers pulled me from the water. . . </i>

603
00:39:58,964 --> 00:39:59,954
breathing. . .

604
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:02,585
intact. . .

605
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:04,917
alive.

606
00:40:05,878 --> 00:40:08,960
On this horrible day, over a hundred people died.

607
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:12,555
But not me.

608
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:16,329
I was the sole survivor.

609
00:40:19,804 --> 00:40:22,286
<i>And it took me a hell of a long time to figure out why. </i>

610
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,091
<i>And I know a lot of you be asking yourselves that question. </i>

611
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,289
<i>But ultimately, it doesn't matter </i>

612
00:40:33,687 --> 00:40:34,536
<i>because. . . </i>

613
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:38,283
I don't know why I lived.

614
00:40:40,615 --> 00:40:42,021
I don't know how I lived.

615
00:40:43,397 --> 00:40:45,033
But I do know that I emerged. . .

616
00:40:46,106 --> 00:40:49,495
stronger and with a clearer purpose.

617
00:40:50,722 --> 00:40:53,614
And that's the promise that hurricane eve holds
for all of you.

618
00:40:55,069 --> 00:40:59,221
Whether you believe it's god's gift or,
no offense,  father, just sheer luck. . .

619
00:41:00,943 --> 00:41:03,239
you have all been given a second chance on life,

620
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:06,853
and I encourage you not to squander it
or dwell on why you were chosen.

621
00:41:09,029 --> 00:41:10,245
<i>We make choices every day. </i>

622
00:41:12,729 --> 00:41:16,498
<i>Some that are clear,  and some not so clear. </i>

623
00:41:18,031 --> 00:41:19,588
<i>But I believe that we have been chosen</i>

624
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:23,180
<i>to rebuild this community</i>

625
00:41:24,674 --> 00:41:26,001
<i>as we rebuild ourselves. </i>

626
00:41:27,915 --> 00:41:29,855
<i>Some of us will rise to the challenge. </i>

627
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:32,771
<i>Others won't. </i>

628
00:41:34,834 --> 00:41:38,073
But we will all ultimately. . .

629
00:41:39,942 --> 00:41:41,046
survive.

630
00:41:43,871 --> 00:41:45,583
Because we already have.
