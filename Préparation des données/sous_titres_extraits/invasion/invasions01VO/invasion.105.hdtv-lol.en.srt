1
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,410
all right.

2
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,380
Let's take a look.

3
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,560
That's not bad.

4
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,860
That should hold for awhile.

5
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,020
Where'd you get that door?

6
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,850
It's part of the original house.

7
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:55,740
I took it off when I added the master bedroom.

8
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,500
Here.

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,120
Thanks for your help,son.

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,170
Yeah,I don't know what I did,but you're welcome.

11
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,600
Hey,honey,do you remember a guy named vince teracona?

12
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,170
Sounds like a race car driver.

13
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,390
I met him when I first moved out here.

14
00:01:08,390 --> 00:01:09,840
He was in the air force reserve.

15
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,340
Yeah,didn't you used to date him?

16
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,710
He was more like a friend.

17
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:15,040
Yeah,she had a lot of friends.

18
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,950
Stop it. I was thinking about calling him.

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,490
Why?

20
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:20,260
You think he might know something about that guy I found?

21
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,030
Well,yeah

22
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,830
paxton,the downed helicopter,

23
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:25,320
and that silver box I saw at the crash site.

24
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,900
You think this one guy is gonna know about all that?

25
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:28,930
I don't know.It's a long shot.

26
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:30,600
But I figured if I could ask him a few questions...

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:30,840
daddy!

28
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,200
daddy,you have to come see.

29
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,330
what,honey?

30
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,710
One of the lights is in the water.

31
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,170
It was right there.

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,130
What--what kind of lights,rose?

33
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:49,160
Like the ones I saw in the hurricane.

34
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,850
Probably like the ones I saw with kira in the mobile home.

35
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,430
You know what they're talking about?

36
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,870
You shouldn't be down here,okay,rose?

37
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,380
I was building a fort.

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,910
Well,let's build one closer to the house.

39
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,030
Wait a minute.Later.

40
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,790
All right,why don't you draw up a plan for the fort,

41
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,380
and we'll build it together?

42
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,060
I wanna know about the lights.

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,640
You know as much as I do.

44
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:17,890
But if they're bad

45
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,690
honey,honey,just please draw me a fort.

46
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,010
How long have you known about these things?

47
00:02:25,010 --> 00:02:26,380
Since the day after the hurricane.

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,670
And no one told me?

49
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,420
Or him,and he could've gotten killed.

50
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,090
Hey,I was almost killed,too,okay?

51
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:32,930
I've been chasing around after the air force,

52
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:33,980
trying to find what they're looking for,

53
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,820
and all the while,you've known that there are lights

54
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,730
we don't know anything.

55
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,060
Rose saw some lights during the hurricane.

56
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,070
And dave got attacked by something in the water.

57
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:42,950
That wasn't a gator.

58
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,420
And jesse saw something,too.

59
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,240
What are they?

60
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:45,780
Fish.

61
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,510
Fish?

62
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:49,330
That fell from the sky?

63
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,490
Bioluminescent fish,yes,

64
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,800
that were tossed up by the hurricane.

65
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,410
Yeah,or extraterrestrial biological entity

66
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,910
that the air force found and locked into a titanium box.

67
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,920
You decide.

68
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:00,650
What,russell?

69
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:02,420
She said she saw them loading some mystery box

70
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,670
into the back of a semi.

71
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,530
What do you think was in there,tuna?

72
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,730
I just can't believe you didn't tell me about this.

73
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,810
I was gonna tell you.

74
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,670
dad,why didn't you tell me about this?

75
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,370
Probably could've saved me a trip to the hospital.

76
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,690
russell,someone's here!

77
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,810
Hey,russ.

78
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,490
Hey.

79
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,910
Sorry to bother you at home.

80
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,250
I tried the radio,but there wasn't any answer.

81
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,110
What's up,carl?

82
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:31,830
I was wondering,

83
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,550
are you going to flamingo today to the damage assess meeting?

84
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,480
I don't know. Why?

85
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,940
Well,I kind of wondered if maybe we could have lunch or something.

86
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,130
Nch?

87
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,860
Yeah,I know,it sounds weird,

88
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,230
but,uh,I don't know who else to talk to here.

89
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:46,310
Lucy and I are having some problems.

90
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,080
And,uh,well,

91
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,340
I know I mentioned it last week,

92
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,410
but it's gettin' kinda worse,and,um,

93
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:53,720
I know you and mariel,you had

94
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,390
mariel and I aren't married anymore,carl.

95
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,830
Oh,no,no. I know,I know.

96
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,090
But the thing is that

97
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:01,430
I'm going to see that guy,russell.

98
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,370
Honey,can you just wait a sec?

99
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,880
No.One sec?

100
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,080
Look,carl,is it okay if we talk later?

101
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,920
Listen,are you gonna come in at all today?

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,210
I don't know. It's my day off.

103
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,650
Hey,jesse,where are you goin'?

104
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,670
For a walk.

105
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,480
No,stay here.I wanna talk to you.

106
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
Is that an order?

107
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,210
Yeah. Hey,larkin,please,can you just wait?

108
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:20,510
Damn it.

109
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,550
Daddy!

110
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,170
Instead of a fort,

111
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,020
could we build a tree house?

112
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,280
This really isn't a good time,carl.

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,920
Yeah,but will I see you at flamingo?

114
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,550
I don't know.

115
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:31,750
I don't know,but if not today,tomorrow,okay?

116
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,390
Yeah.

117
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,470
Yeah.

118
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,660
Sure.

119
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,920
mariel.

120
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,970
Morning.

121
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,450
Morning,father.

122
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,650
Meat loaf?

123
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:51,950
Yeah. My attempt at a family dinner.

124
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,480
I've been meaning to talk to you.

125
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,800
I heard you had a rough night in the hurricane.

126
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,340
So did I.

127
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,970
We've started a survivor's group

128
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,550
at the church if you're interested.

129
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,970
A survivor's group?

130
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,790
Yeah,it's for people who've had

131
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:09,360
an especially traumatic experience.

132
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,410
This is a nondenominational thing,

133
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,240
purely extracurricular.

134
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,650
Just neighbors reaching out to neighbors,

135
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,470
trying to help them transition.

136
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,120
Transition to what?

137
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,850
Oh,thank you.

138
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,270
Wholeness.

139
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:28,550
I'm sure you've had some conflicted feelings since your ordeal.

140
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,280
I know I have.

141
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,700
Well,thank you,father.

142
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,200
but I'd like to discuss this with my husband first.

143
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,010
Oh,tom's all for it.

144
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,400
As a matter of fact,

145
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,900
he's the one who suggested I invite you.

146
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,870
what's up,lewis?

147
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:06,280
Owner got back from lunch,found a looter inside.

148
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:06,850
A looter?

149
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:08,320
You didn't have to call me for this.

150
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,120
When we tried to gain entry,

151
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,590
the suspect threatened to shoot.

152
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:13,380
Said he wouldn't come out unless he talked to you.

153
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,320
alone.

154
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,600
Really?

155
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,830
I wouldn't go in by yourself,sir.

156
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,720
It's all right,lewis.

157
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,260
Just keep the car running.

158
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,190
Don't you want a flashlight,sir?

159
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,300
you wanted to see me?

160
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,530
Sheriff.

161
00:07:45,530 --> 00:07:46,610
Put down the gun,carl.

162
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:49,560
No,not until you tell me what's goin' on.

163
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:51,550
There's nothing to tell.

164
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,400
You're breaking and entering.

165
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,260
Put down the gun.

166
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:55,330
I need it.

167
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:56,910
The owner needs it more.

168
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,480
Put it down.

169
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,710
You coulda helped me.

170
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:03,160
Why didn't you help me?!

171
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,470
All right,you want a tree house,

172
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,050
you are gonna get a tree house.

173
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:10,580
But it's so close to the house.

174
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,870
Well,we like close.

175
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,440
Close is good,isn't it,dave?

176
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,470
Yeah.

177
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,190
Hey,so you got a plan for this thing?

178
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,100
You wanna go round,square,

179
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,560
one,two platforms,what?

180
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,780
Um,let's go two platforms,a ladder and a rope swing.

181
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:24,370
You want a rope swing?

182
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,110
Sure.

183
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,780
All right. You're gonna get a rope swing.

184
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:29,370
But you're not goin' down by that water anymore.

185
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,760
At least not until we figure out what's in there.

186
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,240
Right,rose?

187
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:36,240
Right.

188
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,600
Okay. All right,uncle dave,

189
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,310
take over.

190
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,990
Uh,yeah. Okay.

191
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,870
hey,jess,it's dad.

192
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,200
Son.

193
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,850
Will you take those off?

194
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,570
look,I'm sorry that I didn't tell you what was going on?

195
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,230
I just didn't want to scare anybody.

196
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,510
I wouldn't have been scared.

197
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,040
I woulda been interested.

198
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
I know.

199
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,580
You really think it's a fish?

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,620
Yeah.

201
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,750
Granted,one that probably doesn't belong here.

202
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,060
You think it's an alien?

203
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,880
No.

204
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,380
Me either.

205
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,860
All right. I'm gonna get back out to work.

206
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,540
Hey,dad.

207
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,810
Do I have to stay at mom's tonight?

208
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:55,070
Yeah.

209
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:55,710
Well,I don't want to.

210
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,950
I want to stay here.

211
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:58,690
Well,you know I'd love to,but it's your mom's day.

212
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,710
I know she's gonna want to see you.

213
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,800
But I don't see her.

214
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,660
Since the hurricane,she's hardly ever home,

215
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,820
and when she is,it's like she's not there anyway.

216
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,690
Hey,russ,russ.

217
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,300
Some deputy wants to talk to you.

218
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:13,930
yeah.

219
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,720
they're inside.

220
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,670
I really don't know what he wanted.

221
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:46,090
He just drew the gun on me so fast.

222
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,290
Tom.

223
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:54,480
Hey.

224
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,090
How did this happen?

225
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,640
Maybe you can tell me.

226
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,340
So you said he ce over to see you this morning.

227
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,220
Yeah,he wanted to talk,

228
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,890
have lunch.

229
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:22,570
Any idea why he might have done this?

230
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:24,900
He said he was having problems at home.

231
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,220
Have you talked to lucy?

232
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,850
Who?

233
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:28,200
His wife.

234
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,830
No. No,not yet.

235
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,410
We have a couple of deputies on the way to the house right now.

236
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,240
Damn it!

237
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:36,390
Were you close with the family?

238
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,450
Used to be.

239
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,140
When mariel and I were married,

240
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,620
we hung out quite a bit.

241
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,240
Why didn't I talk to him?

242
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,910
Sheriff,

243
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:45,490
here's your backup.

244
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:54,280
The gun that was fired has been impounded pending investigation.

245
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:55,790
Will there be an investigation?

246
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,700
Of course.

247
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,070
You had no choice,sir.

248
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,150
You always have a choice,lewis.

249
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,890
You just have to be sure you make the right one.

250
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,840
Thanks.

251
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,900
all vehicles must display a D.O.D. Security tag at all times.

252
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,430
Can I have some I.D.,Ma'am?

253
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,830
I'm here to see master sergeant vince teracona.

254
00:12:28,830 --> 00:12:30,320
Do you know what unit he's with,ma'am?

255
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,630
Civil engineering offices.

256
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,270
Okay.

257
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,910
Clear!

258
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,000
That'll be straight down on your right,ma'am.

259
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,590
Thank you.

260
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,440
You're welcome.

261
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,510
Larkin.

262
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,570
Vince.

263
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,970
How are you?

264
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,180
Awesome.

265
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,730
How are you,mama?

266
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,170
Be careful.

267
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,350
You might get my breakfast in your lap.

268
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:18,110
Wow. You look awesome.

269
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:19,610
You don't look fat at all.

270
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,430
thanks.

271
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,720
I-I'm so glad you called.

272
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,410
You know,

273
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,600
nobody ever believes me when I tell them

274
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,090
I used to date larkin groves of the channel 7 I-team.

275
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,590
What does the "I" stand for anyways?

276
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,260
Is it like eye "I" or just I "I"?

277
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,180
Just "I" for investigation.

278
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,030
Oh,well,I hope you're not investigating me today.

279
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,090
Not unless you have something to hide.

280
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,520
Come on.

281
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,900
Our chariot awaits.

282
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:54,410
the sheriff's office has confirmed

283
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:57,940
it was indeed tom underlay in this officer-involved shooting...

284
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:02,500
hey,kira.

285
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,410
Have you heard about this?

286
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,120
Yes. It's all over the radio.

287
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:09,380
Has your father called in?

288
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,690
No.

289
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,250
your friends with his son,aren't you?

290
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,310
Yeah.

291
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,540
What am I gonna say to him?

292
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,880
Sorry my dad killed your dad?

293
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,900
tom?

294
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,810
tom,is that you?

295
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,570
Sorry,it's just me.

296
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:30,070
Hi.

297
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,650
I came by to get some clothes.

298
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:33,670
Clothes,for what?Come here.

299
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,730
For what?

300
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,380
I want to stay at dad's tonight.

301
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,680
No.

302
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,490
No. Tonight's our night.

303
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,820
Mom,it's not really gonna be that great of a night,is it?

304
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,980
What does that mean?

305
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,350
Have you seen the news?

306
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,110
Yes.

307
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:49,450
It kinda sucks.

308
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,500
Jesse.

309
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,920
Jesse,come here.Come here.

310
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,200
Now I want you to be here.

311
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,430
Under the circumstances,

312
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,850
I think we need to be together as a family.

313
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,480
I don't want to be here tonight.

314
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,510
Why?

315
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,650
Hey,kira.

316
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,300
Jesse.

317
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,770
Jesse!

318
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,020
What?!

319
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:26,820
Jesse.

320
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,530
I'll talk to him.

321
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,790
russell.

322
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,030
Hey.

323
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,830
Oh,lucy. I'm so sorry.

324
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:01,870
do you want some coffee?It's still hot.

325
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,380
No.The deputies just left.

326
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:11,430
Honey,do you remember mr. Varon?

327
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,980
Hey,gage.

328
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,220
Hey.

329
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,750
I'm sorry about your dad.

330
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,410
Thanks.

331
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,870
It's sweet of you to come by,russell.

332
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,120
I'm sure a lot of people must have

333
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,110
must have called,

334
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,400
but with the phones out

335
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:32,630
yeah,lucy,uh,

336
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,740
carl came to see me this morning.

337
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,150
Why?

338
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:42,950
I guess he wanted to talk.

339
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,210
He said you two were having problems.

340
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,580
Was he sober?

341
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,980
I-I think so.

342
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,090
He didn't own a gun,you know?

343
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,860
I'm sure that's why he broke into that place.

344
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,360
To steal a gun?

345
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,270
Things with haven't been good for a long time,

346
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,460
russell but since the hurricane,

347
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,880
it has just been insane.

348
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,710
Carl was drinking a lot,

349
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:14,040
he'd gotten very abusive physically abusive.

350
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,310
I-I can't believe that.

351
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,890
He was very depressed,angry.

352
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,820
I just don't think he wanted the burden of a family anymore.

353
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:24,300
Last night I told him I wanted a divorce,

354
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,580
and he went crazy.

355
00:17:26,870 --> 00:17:28,710
I finally had to call the sheriff.

356
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,340
Sheriff underlay?

357
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,230
If he hadn't shown up,

358
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,220
I don't know what might have happened.

359
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,890
The sheriff said he didn't know you.

360
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,880
I mean,if carl had had a gun last night,

361
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,960
I don't know,I just

362
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,850
you wouldn't have recognized him.

363
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,520
He wasn't the same person.

364
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:54,170
jesse,will you just wait for me a sec?

365
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,150
I waited all night for you,kira,

366
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:57,230
while you and that...

367
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,180
whatever.

368
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,470
I hope it was worth it.

369
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,230
Nothing happened.

370
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:03,640
Yeah,right.

371
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,580
Is that why you don't want to be at our house,

372
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,530
'cause of me?

373
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,010
I just wanna help out my dad,okay?

374
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,780
What about your mom?

375
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,530
What about her?

376
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,960
She's really upset.

377
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,560
She'll be fine.

378
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,140
Look,I know she's not perfect,

379
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,510
But she's doing the best she can,okay?

380
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,360
We all are.

381
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,580
At least you have a mom.

382
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,170
You're right.

383
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:29,930
Jesse...

384
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,450
will you come with me to see gage?

385
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,580
I wouldn't know what to say to him.

386
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,360
I don't know what to say to him either.

387
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:43,190
All right.

388
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,760
Ow!Shoot!

389
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,430
hey,russell.

390
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,570
Hey,mariel.

391
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:11,210
What's up?

392
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,270
Did you hear about carl?

393
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,130
Yeah.

394
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,020
It's awful.

395
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,710
Come in.

396
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:25,520
You all right?

397
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,800
Yeah.

398
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,140
No.

399
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,180
actually,I should go grab a band-aid.

400
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,700
Is tom home?

401
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:37,970
No.

402
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,880
Have you talked to lucy?

403
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:41,130
I just saw her.

404
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,510
How is she?

405
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:44,840
Not good.

406
00:19:46,570 --> 00:19:47,130
You know,apparently,

407
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:49,140
she and carl have been having problems.

408
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:51,090
Finally.

409
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:52,760
Sorry,russell,can this wait?

410
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:53,690
Can what wait?

411
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,250
Where have you been?

412
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,770
I've been trying to reach you all morning.

413
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,490
I've been trying to reach you,too.

414
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,930
You're on the wrong channel,honey.

415
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,380
just dropping off the kids,russ?

416
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,360
No,I just saw lucy mckittrick.

417
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,030
Honey,can you give us a minute?

418
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,150
Tom...

419
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,580
I need to talk to you.

420
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,330
Just a minute.

421
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,210
I'm sorry if this is a bad time.

422
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,720
It's a bad day.What's up?

423
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,930
Why didn't you tell me you were at carl's house last night?

424
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:40,190
I asked you if you knew lucy,you said no.

425
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,180
What difference does it make?

426
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,100
You could've arrested him.

427
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,630
She said he was beating her up pretty bad.

428
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,540
Russell,do you know how many domestic dispute calls

429
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,330
I've had since the hurricane?

430
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,360
Ople are comin' apart at the seams.

431
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,130
No water,no power

432
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,560
if I arrested every guy that looked like

433
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,050
he was about to go off the deep end,

434
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,790
that would be about half this town.

435
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:00,530
I made a judgment call last night.

436
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:03,180
I thought the situation was contained.

437
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:06,710
Obviously,I was wrong.

438
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:09,970
But why are you the one that seems so guilty?

439
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,480
He was my friend.

440
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,430
Your friend tried to kill me.

441
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,230
And we both had a chance to help him,but we didn'T.

442
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,260
The only difference is

443
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,120
you knew how dangerous the situation was.

444
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,330
I'm sorry I called you.

445
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,520
I'm not gonna leave this alone,tom.

446
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,800
You do what you have to do.

447
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,290
I'm not gonna let this go.

448
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:56,560
So how's married life?

449
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,850
You've been hitched now,what,almost a year?

450
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,110
Yeah,a year in november.

451
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,890
And it's great?It's all great?

452
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,810
It's pretty great.

453
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:05,980
What about you,vince?

454
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,720
You,uh,you where you wanna be?

455
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:09,940
Well,I'm a senior master sergeant now,

456
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:12,140
so I'm pretty much in charge of this place.

457
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,150
You run the base?

458
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,490
No. No,no,no.

459
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,870
That'd be the air base wing commander.

460
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:17,690
But anything maintenance related,

461
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:20,880
every structure,all operations--that's me.

462
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,340
Hey,you wouldn't know anything about a downed helicopter,

463
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:26,140
would you?Or a missing weather plane,anything like that?

464
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,270
Downed helicopter?

465
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:28,740
You tryin' to give us a bad name?

466
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,130
Hold on now.

467
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,130
We're entering a special clearance area.

468
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,110
What goes on in there?

469
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,000
Oh,that's an O.S.I. Hangar.

470
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,760
Office of special investigations.

471
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,800
They don't let mere mortals anywhere near there.

472
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,420
But if you'd like to see the weather facility,

473
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,500
I could arrange that.

474
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,340
And they got a great little lunch spot right next door.

475
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,400
Sound good?Yeah.

476
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:52,990
Two hamburgers and some freedom fries coming up.

477
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,340
Where you going?

478
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,810
To see the priest.

479
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,030
Isn't that what you want?

480
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,730
The priest?

481
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,810
Yeah,I bumped into father scanlon at the markethis morning.

482
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:17,040
He said you wanted me to join his survivor's group.

483
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,090
Be nice if you had talked to me about it.

484
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:21,440
But maybe you discussed it with russell instead.

485
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,260
Mariel.

486
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:24,720
I've been worried sick about you all morning,tom,

487
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,360
and you come home and just dismiss me.

488
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,750
I didn't dismiss you.

489
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,300
I what

490
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
how do you feel about what happened?

491
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,360
I feel confused and

492
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,350
by what?

493
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:39,230
You killed somebody.

494
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:40,340
I know.

495
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,610
So why aren't you more upset about it?

496
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:43,720
I am.

497
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:45,320
Doesn't seem like it.

498
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:46,870
You don'seem upset at all.

499
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:47,780
Why aren't you upset?

500
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,370
Because I knew it was gonna happen.

501
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,200
You knew what was gonna happen?

502
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,260
From the moment I walked into that place this morning,

503
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,590
I knew that that guy was gonna be dead.

504
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,360
I don't know why,

505
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,090
I don't know how,I just knew.

506
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:06,610
Like I know a lot of things.

507
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:13,910
Do you know how your wife is feeling right now?

508
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,060
Alone.

509
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:58,920
Mariel.

510
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,080
Hey,father.

511
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:05,420
Our meeting's not until 7:00.

512
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,640
I was in the neighborhood.

513
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,350
I heard about what happened this morning.

514
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,760
Is tom all right?

515
00:25:17,410 --> 00:25:18,990
I think he will be.

516
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,620
Did you know mr. Mckittrick?

517
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,090
I know his wife.

518
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,270
It's very sad.

519
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,610
Yes.

520
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:35,370
Who lives and who dies it all seems so random,

521
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,640
doesn't it?

522
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,030
It's not,of course.

523
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,330
Are you sure?

524
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,580
Who are you talking to?

525
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,930
What's wrong,mariel?

526
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,920
I,um...

527
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,180
I'm worried about my family.

528
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:02,310
My son jesse

529
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,520
I don't know if you remember him.

530
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,730
I don't think he wants to live with me anymore.

531
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,180
Since the hurricane,

532
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,320
I... haven't been as attentive.

533
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,990
I've been very distracted.

534
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,830
And tom is just so

535
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:34,540
hard to reach sometimes.

536
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,950
Did I tell you I was from minnesota?

537
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:46,390
Did you know that?

538
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,910
No.

539
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,400
Well,I am.

540
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,120
When I was a kid,

541
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,080
I used to do a lot of skiing,

542
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,630
but I was never very good

543
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,000
because I was always so busy

544
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:02,640
trying to hang on to the mountain.

545
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,870
Don't fall down,don't fall down

546
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,040
that's all I kept telling myself.

547
00:27:08,170 --> 00:27:10,040
So,of course,that's all I kept doing.

548
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,730
I can't let go of my family.

549
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,470
You don't have to.

550
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,540
If jesse wants to live with his dad for awhile,let him.

551
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,810
Russell's not perfect.

552
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:30,170
Jesse may start to appreciate you more

553
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,390
if he has some time away.

554
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,010
And tom?

555
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,870
You're never going lose him.

556
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:46,080
Ever.

557
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,000
Does he come here?

558
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,300
No.

559
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,840
But I'd be happy to invite him if you'd like me to.

560
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,290
And... if that meat loaf will keep a day,

561
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,750
I hope you'll join us.

562
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,660
okay.

563
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,160
Are we going to have to do this all by ourselves?

564
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,730
Yeah,I guess we are.

565
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,080
I thought daddy and jesse were going to help.

566
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,990
Well,they were a little bit busy.

567
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:28,340
But you know what?

568
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,620
We can do it on our own,right?

569
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,780
We can.

570
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:31,720
Yeah,we can.

571
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:33,950
Hey,what was that,uh...

572
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,020
what was that spanish song you were singing earlier?

573
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,250
"Seòˆra santana"?

574
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:40,220
Yeah. What is that?

575
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,090
Seòˆra santana,

576
00:28:42,090 --> 00:28:44,220
por que llora el niòˆ?

577
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,320
No,I mean in english,what does it mean?

578
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,160
It's about a boy who's crying 'cause he lost his apple.

579
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,290
How'd he lose his apple?

580
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,330
I don't know,

581
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,410
but seòˆra santana

582
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,130
tries to give him a new one,

583
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:55,790
and he doesn't want that one.

584
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,120
He wants the one he lost.

585
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:58,850
Yeah.

586
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,660
I think a lot of guys can relate to that.

587
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,520
Keep singing that song.Come on.

588
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,760
seòˆra santana

589
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,780
por que llora el niòˆ?

590
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,020
Come on.Hit that high note.

591
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:10,840
Por una manzana

592
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,650
que se le ha perdido

593
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,100
oh,yeah,keep that rhythm strong.

594
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:18,960
Here we are.

595
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,250
This'll just take a second,larkin.

596
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:28,420
See? It's weather world.

597
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:32,000
You can plan your next vacation here.

598
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,530
Just give me two minutes,okay?

599
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,450
But you gotta stay here.

600
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,640
You got it.

601
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,890
take it to the pine island vitors' center in the park.

602
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:11,670
Okay.

603
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,930
Anks.

604
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,150
Hey,deputy.

605
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,460
Were there cameras inside?

606
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,600
Was there a generator,by chance?

607
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,350
No,sir.

608
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,660
So no one witnessed the shooting?

609
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,540
No,sir.

610
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,400
At the suspect's request,

611
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,160
the sheriff went in alone.

612
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,920
Carl asked to see underlay?

613
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,390
Yes,sir.

614
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,160
Thank you.

615
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,390
Gage?

616
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,450
Hi.Hey.

617
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,310
What are you doing here?

618
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,100
Whoa,wait a second.What do you want?

619
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,340
To apologize.

620
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,830
I had no idea what was goin' on in your house.

621
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:23,560
You still have no idea.

622
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,690
Yeah,well,maybe not,but...

623
00:31:27,910 --> 00:31:29,190
I'm sorry.

624
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:32,440
You know,your dad was always a good friend to me.

625
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,570
If you ever need to talk,about anything

626
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,580
you know what my mom told you

627
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,010
about... my father abusing her?

628
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,500
It's total garbage.

629
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:46,530
She was the one beating on him.

630
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:48,580
If he needed a gun,

631
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,720
it was only to protect himself.

632
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,510
Ever since they pulled her out of the water,

633
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,510
she's been like a completely different person.

634
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,360
We lost mom the night eve hit.

635
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,390
Red cross found her,

636
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:05,810
but she didn't come back the same.

637
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:10,870
He just wanted her to be the same.

638
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,670
Gage.

639
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,220
Gage.

640
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,070
You following me?

641
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,530
I came to talk to your mom.

642
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,030
She's not here.

643
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,900
Where is she?

644
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:58,810
I don't know.

645
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,880
Probably at the church where she always is now.

646
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,910
The church?

647
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,540
Hurricane survivors group.

648
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,550
Her new family.

649
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:11,580
Where you goin'?

650
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,080
To my uncle'S.

651
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,670
My mom doesn't want me here anymore.

652
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,620
Wait a minute,you're movin' out,today?

653
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:20,970
She didn't want my dad,

654
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:22,410
and now she doesn't want me.

655
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:27,530
Say hello to your son for me.

656
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,600
man,you are a dog with a bone today,aren't you?

657
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,800
What are you doing here,tom?

658
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,390
Selling bibles.What are you doing?

659
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:13,110
You know,I talked to your deputy today.

660
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,130
I know you did.

661
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,610
I also know you talked to the kid.

662
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:18,130
Tell me,are you working as an official ranger detective now?

663
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,990
Carl asked to see you this morning.

664
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,400
Was it because he was concerned about his wife?

665
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,000
About what happened to her in the hurricane?

666
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,740
Like I said earlier,

667
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,740
there'll be a full investigation into the shooting.

668
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:29,880
I'm not talking about the shooting,tom.

669
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:32,080
I'm asking you if you know specifically

670
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,770
what happened to lucy.

671
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,880
I mean,you protected her at carl's expense. Why?

672
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,580
Why,is it because she's part of this?

673
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,690
Is that what it is,because she's a survivor?

674
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,650
What the hell does that mean,tom?

675
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,660
What is happening to all these people?

676
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,820
Oh,no.

677
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,880
She shouldn't be here.

678
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,500
She belongs here.

679
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,510
I take care of my loved ones.

680
00:37:15,510 --> 00:37:17,810
Maybe you oughta think about doin' the same.

681
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,810
Well,thanks,vince.Really appreciate the tour.

682
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,770
No problem.

683
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:38,640
I'm just glad we were able to see each other again.

684
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:39,600
You take care of that baby,huh?

685
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,080
Yeah,I will.

686
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,940
All right. Bye now.Bye.

687
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:09,670
as those of you who've been with us before know,

688
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:12,400
this is a place where people come together

689
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,570
to tell their stories of survival.

690
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,640
And hopefully,

691
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,810
find greater meaning in our lives.

692
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:21,390
But with the blessings of a second chance

693
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:23,630
come greater responsibilities.

694
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:28,510
And nobody knows that better than sheriff tom underlay.

695
00:38:34,850 --> 00:38:36,150
Thank you,father.

696
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,690
Did you know your husband was gonna talk tonight?

697
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,880
No.

698
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,950
Unlike most of you,

699
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:48,110
who've endured the trauma of a hurricane,

700
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,090
my story goes back a few years.

701
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,840
It's a story that some of you know

702
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,320
but for those of you who don't,

703
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:59,750
in 1996,my wife and I...

704
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,170
my first wife

705
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,150
were on a flight to atlanta to visit her sister

706
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:09,380
when I heard a loud,popping sound.

707
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,550
It was 2:10 in the afternoon.

708
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,360
In the next three minutes,

709
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:16,990
the plane banked and headed back toward miami.

710
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,010
But the cabin filled with smoke.

711
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:24,620
53 seconds later,the plane dropped 6,000 feet

712
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:26,960
crashed into the everglades

713
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:30,540
and spread debris over a solid square mile.

714
00:39:35,570 --> 00:39:37,000
At this point,I

715
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,920
I really don't remember what happened.

716
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,200
They tell me that they immediately called off

717
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,500
the search for survivors,

718
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,390
that it was impossible for anyone to live through the crash.

719
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:52,560
They also tell me that 19 hours later

720
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:56,120
two rescuers pulled me from the water

721
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,120
breathing

722
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,720
intact

723
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,640
alive.

724
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,400
On this horrible day,

725
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,570
over a hundred people died.

726
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,060
But not me.

727
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,080
I was the sole survivor.

728
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,680
and it took me a hell of a long time to figure out why.

729
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,020
And I know a lot of you

730
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:28,410
may be asking yourselves that question.

731
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,380
But ultimately,it doesn't matter

732
00:40:33,550 --> 00:40:34,920
because

733
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,600
I don't know why I lived.

734
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:42,630
I don't know how I lived.

735
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,740
But I do know that I emerged.

736
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,370
stronger

737
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,020
anwith a clearer purpose.

738
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:53,850
And that's the promise that hurricane eve holds for all of you.

739
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,150
Whether you believe it's god's gift or,no offense,

740
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:59,680
father, just sheer luck

741
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,040
you have all been given a second chance on life,

742
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,190
and I encourage you not to squander it

743
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,390
or dwell on why you were chosen.

744
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,760
We make choices every day.

745
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:14,220
Some that are clear,

746
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,120
and some not so clear.

747
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,010
But I believe that we have been chosen

748
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:26,730
to rebuild this community as we rebuild ourselves.

749
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,000
Some of us will rise to the challenge.

750
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,180
Others won'T.

751
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,730
But we will all ultimately

752
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,570
survive.

753
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:46,000
Because we already have.
