00:00:16,284 --> 00:00:16,977
Mariel.

5
00:00:24,143 --> 00:00:25,212
I'm not crazy, Tom.

6
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:29,172
I saw my body in this water...

7
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:32,788
Dead.

8
00:00:34,312 --> 00:00:36,065
I want you to get a crew out here and dredge this.

9
00:00:38,889 --> 00:00:40,106
And I want them to dig deep.

10
00:00:48,842 --> 00:00:50,732
Hey, bloggers, it's Dave.

11
00:00:51,155 --> 00:00:53,215
Four weeks after hurricane eve made landfall,

12
00:00:54,011 --> 00:00:55,881
things aren't getting any less strange around here.

13
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:58,781
The aliens, or whatever they are..

14
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:02,632
my brother-in-law, Russel, says they're fish,

15
00:01:02,667 --> 00:01:05,486
the military says they're squid.
I say both.

16
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:07,196
They're still swimmin' out there in the 'glades.

17
00:01:08,648 --> 00:01:12,800
But it's the people, the people of the town
that I want to talk about today

18
00:01:13,539 --> 00:01:15,679
Yeah, too many folks

19
00:01:17,088 --> 00:01:18,458
spent entirely too many hours

20
00:01:18,493 --> 00:01:19,869
in the water the night of the hurricane

21
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:21,468
not to have seen something...

22
00:01:22,953 --> 00:01:25,733
Yet, none of these so-called survivors are talking,

23
00:01:26,606 --> 00:01:27,799
at least, not in public.

24
00:01:28,346 --> 00:01:32,046
But they are having secret meetings
at this local church twice a day,

25
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:37,691
so yours truly is gonna swing by,
pay a little visit,

26
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:40,087
make sure we're not living in
"village of the damned" here.

27
00:01:42,866 --> 00:01:45,607
I don't know who I am anymore.

28
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:50,099
I-I feel like...

29
00:01:51,877 --> 00:01:58,465
there's a storm brewing inside me
that feels more powerful than any hurricane.

30
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:05,053
My husband sees it and it scares him...

31
00:02:07,568 --> 00:02:11,831
and he's fighting hard to hang on to me, but he can't.

32
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:15,942
He can't.

33
00:02:22,873 --> 00:02:26,267
Last night, I went to the place in the water

34
00:02:27,449 --> 00:02:31,786
where I was found the morning after the hurricane and I saw...

35
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:40,312
hi.

36
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:50,794
It's all right, Mariel.

37
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,811
Please, go on.

38
00:03:00,478 --> 00:03:01,455
Do you know what, father ? I...

39
00:03:03,445 --> 00:03:05,655
I think this is just too much right now.

40
00:03:07,602 --> 00:03:08,970
What I really feel like doing is having a drink...

41
00:03:09,956 --> 00:03:11,596
or two or three.

42
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:15,939
Listen, you guys are great,

43
00:03:17,234 --> 00:03:20,286
so supportive, and if I am going crazy,

44
00:03:21,502 --> 00:03:24,013
I can't imagine a better group of people to go crazy with.

45
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,579
Thank you for listening.

46
00:03:35,012 --> 00:03:36,269
Well, you wanted a picnic ?

47
00:03:36,612 --> 00:03:37,604
You're getting a picnic.

48
00:03:38,236 --> 00:03:40,676
- Where are we ?
- We are in my secret spot.

49
00:03:41,317 --> 00:03:44,680
- What secret spot ?
- My most favorite secret spot

50
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,034
to make out with my beautiful, pregnant wife.

51
00:03:47,871 --> 00:03:50,691
- Ohh, that secret spot.
- Yeah.

52
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,633
What are you gonna do with me when I get all big and fat ?

53
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:02,649
this.

54
00:04:08,405 --> 00:04:09,008
honey ?

55
00:04:12,288 --> 00:04:12,856
Baby ?

56
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,152
What is it ?

57
00:04:20,363 --> 00:04:22,878
the pond.They've poisoned the pond.

58
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:28,448
The sons of bitches.

59
00:04:29,058 --> 00:04:30,354
This was the most beautiful place,

60
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:32,256
and they killed it.

61
00:04:32,676 --> 00:04:34,170
Who ? Who, Russ ?

62
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,261
What happened here ?

63
00:04:47,845 --> 00:04:50,548
I'll be back in five minutes.Wait here.

64
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,517
- You can't come in here without a warrant !
- I'm not a cop !

65
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:04,381
Yeah, well, this ain't park land, either.

66
00:05:04,573 --> 00:05:05,758
You can't just pop on in !You little...

67
00:05:10,023 --> 00:05:11,467
oh, the harvest looks good this year, Bob !

68
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:12,881
That fertilizer really works !

69
00:05:14,672 --> 00:05:15,394
But it wasn't just fertilizer

70
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,035
you dumped out in the sewer this time, was it, huh ?

71
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:19,855
What'd you put in the water ?What'd you put in the water ? !

72
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:20,920
Carla, don't !

73
00:05:21,909 --> 00:05:22,947
- Sit down !
- Son of a bitch !

74
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:23,984
Sit your ass down !

75
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:27,194
You've been dumping there a long time, Bob,

76
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:29,145
but it was something else this time, wasn't it ?

77
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,095
Something much more toxic.

78
00:05:30,326 --> 00:05:30,706
Russell !

79
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:32,193
What are you doing ?

80
00:05:32,954 --> 00:05:33,642
Get back in the car.

81
00:05:36,118 --> 00:05:36,991
What did you put in the water ?

82
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:40,842
Nothin'. Just fertilizer,

83
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:43,204
and the only reason we dumped it there

84
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:44,892
is 'cause the place was already dead.

85
00:05:45,381 --> 00:05:45,914
You're lying.

86
00:05:46,182 --> 00:05:48,393
No. We was there before the hurricane and it was fine.

87
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:50,219
We come back a week or so later,

88
00:05:50,413 --> 00:05:53,650
and it's all gone ,brown crap everywhere.

89
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,318
You got phone service back yet ?Yesterday.

90
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:57,890
Call the police.

91
00:05:58,917 --> 00:05:59,486
You call 'em.

92
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:02,024
- Call the police !
- Son of a bitch !

93
00:06:04,498 --> 00:06:05,260
I'l ll call them.

94
00:06:06,288 --> 00:06:07,469
you're gonna pay for this !

95
00:06:16,577 --> 00:06:18,331
Yeah, let's move mr. Conlan out of I.C.U.

96
00:06:18,559 --> 00:06:19,820
See if there's roomin the main unit.

97
00:06:21,084 --> 00:06:21,652
Hey, doctor.

98
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:24,317
Hey, Dave. Hey.

99
00:06:24,966 --> 00:06:26,950
Here for a follow-up exam on the old legs.

100
00:06:29,617 --> 00:06:30,189
You're pissed at me.

101
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,007
No. I'm pissed at my ex-husband

102
00:06:33,194 --> 00:06:34,647
who sent you to that meeting this morning, didn't he ?

103
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:35,981
What ? Russell ? No. No, no, no.

104
00:06:36,131 --> 00:06:37,045
- I went on my own.
- Why ?

105
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,039
Because I read about it in the papers ?

106
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,184
- It's for hurricane survivors, Dave.
- Hey, I survived.

107
00:06:44,656 --> 00:06:45,567
Get this to dr. Peacock.

108
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,452
Look, I was just curious about what goes on in there, okay ?

109
00:06:51,357 --> 00:06:52,082
In case you haven't noticed,

110
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:55,281
there's been some pretty weird stuff happening in town lately.

111
00:06:56,743 --> 00:06:59,752
- What stuff ?
- Stuff, weird behavior.

112
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:05,311
- Russell didn't send you ?
- No, I swear.

113
00:07:09,015 --> 00:07:12,641
It's just a place for people to talk
who've had a similar experience.

114
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:15,002
Right, but they don't let you get drunk though, do they ?

115
00:07:16,182 --> 00:07:18,620
Isn't that what you said you needed ?

116
00:07:19,421 --> 00:07:19,992
I'm working, Dave.

117
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:21,334
Let me just buy you a beer.

118
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,161
I'm working.

119
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:24,533
You get a lunch hour ?

120
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:27,847
Mariel, I'm trying to reach out here.

121
00:07:29,607 --> 00:07:31,018
Isn't that what group of yours is all about ?

122
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:46,679
What ?

123
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:51,102
I have a sTomachache.

124
00:07:52,476 --> 00:07:53,265
From the baby ?

125
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:57,935
No, not from the baby.

126
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,960
Would you have killed that guy if I hadn't been there ?

127
00:08:08,484 --> 00:08:08,977
No.

128
00:08:11,343 --> 00:08:12,520
That's not what I tlooked like.

129
00:08:19,261 --> 00:08:20,365
I think I'm gonna be sick.

130
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,748
You haven't had anything to eat.

131
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:42,196
Here.

132
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:53,562
sure you don't want a beer ?

133
00:08:53,828 --> 00:08:55,928
Uh, they don't really like it when the doctors get drunk.

134
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,393
Right. Good point.

135
00:09:00,343 --> 00:09:02,594
So, I really, really hope

136
00:09:02,783 --> 00:09:06,022
that you didn't run out of the church this morning because of me.

137
00:09:08,918 --> 00:09:09,792
Well, actually, I did.

138
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:12,082
That's what I thought.

139
00:09:13,376 --> 00:09:13,753
Why ?

140
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:20,460
Because what I was about to share was very personal.

141
00:09:22,593 --> 00:09:23,237
I'm really sorry.

142
00:09:26,078 --> 00:09:26,438
Okay.

143
00:09:29,185 --> 00:09:30,554
I'm a little embarrassed. I have to...

144
00:09:31,429 --> 00:09:32,535
I have to tell you I sort of...

145
00:09:34,518 --> 00:09:36,923
I half expected to walk into some kind of...

146
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:43,666
ritualistic, uh, weirdo, something.

147
00:09:44,872 --> 00:09:45,939
- "Village of the damned" ?
- Yeah.

148
00:09:46,434 --> 00:09:47,615
- Really ?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah

149
00:09:47,814 --> 00:09:49,001
exactly like "village of the damned."

150
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:51,556
yeah, I thought you all were gonna be like pod people.

151
00:09:52,545 --> 00:09:53,000
Like what ?

152
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:55,292
You know, like,um, zombified.

153
00:09:57,141 --> 00:09:59,065
You know, like "puppet master,""body snatch" people,

154
00:10:00,526 --> 00:10:01,173
but--

155
00:10:03,015 --> 00:10:05,068
Instead, you look just like everybody else I see in church.

156
00:10:08,762 --> 00:10:10,211
I don't want you to take this the wrong way, Dave...

157
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:11,544
Go ahead.

158
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:16,127
But I really used to think you were an idiot.

159
00:10:16,656 --> 00:10:20,087
Oh. No, that's okay. A lot of people think that.

160
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:21,993
But you're not.

161
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:25,312
You're not an idiot at all.

162
00:10:26,451 --> 00:10:26,990
Thank you.

163
00:10:28,701 --> 00:10:29,653
And you're not a pod person.

164
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:36,965
Are you ?

165
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:48,615
I don't know what I am now,
at least as far as Mariel's concerned.

166
00:10:53,197 --> 00:10:54,383
I don't feel like her husband.

167
00:10:56,478 --> 00:10:57,540
I don't feel like a friend.

168
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,980
I... I feel cut off.

169
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:09,961
- What precipitated this ?
- Mariel's not like you and me, father.

170
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:15,688
She doesn't exactly embrace change.

171
00:11:17,823 --> 00:11:19,493
She's afraid of losing her children.

172
00:11:22,424 --> 00:11:23,912
She's afraid of letting go of the past.

173
00:11:25,702 --> 00:11:26,920
And you're afraid of losing her ?

174
00:11:28,749 --> 00:11:29,212
Yeah.

175
00:11:32,417 --> 00:11:38,157
- But if she doesn't trust you, you will lose her.
- Yeah.Well, what do I do ?

176
00:11:40,634 --> 00:11:43,679
Give her a truth that's acceptable to everyone.

177
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:47,948
Lie ?

178
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:53,549
No. Faith is the substance of things hoped for,

179
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:56,214
the evidence of things not seen.

180
00:11:56,631 --> 00:11:58,041
Mariel will give you her faith

181
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:04,220
if you can just give her the evidence to support it.

182
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:15,119
- Why don't you call for some help ?
- 'Cause I don't need any help.

183
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:23,162
You're gonna lift that whole thing
into the truck by yourself ?

184
00:12:23,545 --> 00:12:24,081
Yep.

185
00:12:29,225 --> 00:12:30,062
- I'll help.
- No.

186
00:12:30,709 --> 00:12:32,726
Hey, you should have let me take you home in the first place.

187
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:36,016
- You can't do it alone, Russell.
- I don't want you to hurt yourself.

188
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,404
Oh. You don't want me to hurt myself,

189
00:12:39,673 --> 00:12:41,578
but you take me to an armed drug dealer's house.

190
00:12:41,883 --> 00:12:42,882
I told you to stay in the car.

191
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:56,176
Larkin, stop. No.

192
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,272
Lift.

193
00:13:00,786 --> 00:13:02,659
My god. Do they all smell this bad ?

194
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:04,880
No, which is why this one's getting an autopsy.

195
00:13:11,975 --> 00:13:14,148
- Well, that was nice.
- Yeah.

196
00:13:14,722 --> 00:13:15,862
- Thank you.
- No problem.

197
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:21,006
Hey, Mariel. If, you know, if you want to talk more...

198
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:24,483
sometime, you know, since I know
we don't know each other that well,

199
00:13:24,894 --> 00:13:26,692
- but we're kind of like family.
- Right.

200
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:28,597
- Sorta.
- Well, thank you.

201
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:29,491
Yeah.

202
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:34,636
And if you ever need to talk, I'm available as well.

203
00:13:36,196 --> 00:13:36,654
Great.

204
00:13:38,636 --> 00:13:39,589
- See you later.
- See you.

205
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:44,543
Thank you.

206
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,492
Mariel, hey. Hey.

207
00:13:54,218 --> 00:13:58,215
Um, hey, there's one... just one thing I'd like to ask you about.

208
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,607
it'd just take a second.

209
00:14:02,598 --> 00:14:03,057
Sure.

210
00:14:03,627 --> 00:14:04,121
Thank you.

211
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,636
So, uh, all of you at the church, the survivors,

212
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:15,841
your one common denominator
is that you all spent a lot of time in the water

213
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:17,482
during the night of the hurricane, right ?

214
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:23,879
Uh, no, not all of us.

215
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:27,588
Some of us... some experienced trauma afterwards.

216
00:14:27,891 --> 00:14:28,778
- Right.
- Mm-hmm.

217
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:36,283
Okay, but has anybody actually told a story
about what happened to them in the water ?

218
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:39,103
You know, if they saw anything ?

219
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:42,460
Did you see anything ?

220
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:46,619
Not that night.

221
00:14:46,925 --> 00:14:48,070
Not that night ?Mnh-mnh.

222
00:14:48,261 --> 00:14:49,289
But since then...

223
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:51,843
since the hurricane, you've seen something ?

224
00:14:55,615 --> 00:14:56,910
'Cause I've seen something, too.

225
00:14:59,195 --> 00:14:59,768
Mariel.

226
00:15:03,775 --> 00:15:04,382
Hello, Dave.

227
00:15:04,689 --> 00:15:06,024
Hey... Tom.

228
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:08,955
So I'm gonna hit the road.

229
00:15:09,603 --> 00:15:10,900
Thanks for the checkup, doc.

230
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:21,759
How's Dave ?

231
00:15:24,843 --> 00:15:25,566
Dave's good.

232
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,290
Mariel...

233
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:39,709
have you started dredging yet ?

234
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:42,710
No. Are you sure that you want me to do this ?

235
00:15:49,225 --> 00:15:50,594
Yes, I'm sure...

236
00:15:52,616 --> 00:15:53,529
and I want to be there.

237
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:57,757
Okay.

238
00:16:00,818 --> 00:16:01,951
But if we find something,

239
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,724
I want you to promise me
that you'll work with me

240
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:06,941
to try and understand it.

241
00:16:13,454 --> 00:16:15,168
I can't promise you that right now.

242
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:36,215
- Hey, Russ.
- Hey, Mona.

243
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:40,487
- Did you beat up Bob Bemming this morning ?
- No. I had him arrested.

244
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,354
- Did you break his jaw ?
- What ?

245
00:16:44,002 --> 00:16:45,413
He's in the hospital with a broken jaw.

246
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:47,011
Says you tried to kill him.

247
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:48,727
Why would you even mess with him, Russell ?

248
00:16:49,221 --> 00:16:50,718
- You know his brother's a judge.
- That's insane.

249
00:16:51,821 --> 00:16:53,114
D.A.'S consideringpressing charges.

250
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:56,456
Someone from his office called the park super
and asked about your record.

251
00:16:57,074 --> 00:16:57,687
What record ?

252
00:16:58,065 --> 00:16:59,779
He was probably talking about the work camp thing.

253
00:17:01,344 --> 00:17:02,296
What work camp thing ?

254
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,763
That thing your uncle sent you to when you were a teenager ?

255
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:07,134
Yeah.

256
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:08,548
I thought that was voluntary.

257
00:17:08,896 --> 00:17:10,461
It was. I could come out here and work

258
00:17:11,414 --> 00:17:12,597
or I could go to juvenile hall.

259
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:14,468
I thought this would be a better option.

260
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:16,986
I didn't know that would go on your record.

261
00:17:17,368 --> 00:17:18,175
Well, now you do.

262
00:17:18,675 --> 00:17:19,285
Careful, careful.

263
00:17:23,018 --> 00:17:23,554
What was the crime ?

264
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,925
I already told you.

265
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:26,270
No.

266
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:29,933
No, you didn't.

267
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:32,446
You told me that you were running with a bad crowd,

268
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:33,591
and that you got into some trouble,

269
00:17:33,626 --> 00:17:35,152
and that's about as specific as you got.

270
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,792
Larkin, I really don't want to talk about this right now.

271
00:17:38,356 --> 00:17:39,393
You should put some gloves on, Mona.

272
00:17:40,724 --> 00:17:44,115
Well, when do you want to talk about it, Russ, when you're in jail ?

273
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,329
- I'm not going to jail.
- Then what's all this about ?

274
00:17:47,092 --> 00:17:48,879
That son of a bitch poisoned my backyard, Larkin.

275
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,811
That's my home out there. I'm not going to let him

276
00:17:51,846 --> 00:17:53,832
or anybody else poison the only home I've ever known.

277
00:17:56,841 --> 00:17:57,223
Well...

278
00:17:58,745 --> 00:17:59,735
if that's your home...

279
00:18:02,261 --> 00:18:03,332
then where do i live ?

280
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:19,490
What ?

281
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:27,419
If I'd only seen this on one corpse,
I probably wouldn't have called you.

282
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,554
But it's popped up a few times now.

283
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:46,999
oh, man.

284
00:18:47,607 --> 00:18:48,828
Yeah, he smells worse than usual.

285
00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:50,734
But I think this is the reason.

286
00:18:52,484 --> 00:18:54,431
This man was a poacher shot out by johnson's pond.

287
00:18:55,496 --> 00:18:57,368
It's near your place, isn't it ?Yeah

288
00:18:58,162 --> 00:19:00,296
Well, this didn't kill him, but I'd sure like to know what it is.

289
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:04,019
It started eating the flesh, which is accelerating
the putrefaction process.

290
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:07,905
This female's got the same problem.

291
00:19:17,246 --> 00:19:17,933
Where is she from ?

292
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:20,674
Don't know. She's a hurricane jane.

293
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:23,618
But they're supposed to be buried this afternoon,

294
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:26,151
and I just wanted to make sure
you didn't want me to give them a closer look.

295
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,693
No, that's okay, arvin.Let 'em rest.

296
00:19:29,641 --> 00:19:30,287
Thanks for the call.

297
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,764
No problem, sheriff.
Door's always open.

298
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:51,376
<i>four weeks after hurricane eve made landfall...</i>

299
00:19:51,605 --> 00:19:52,704
- Hey.
- Hey.

300
00:19:54,061 --> 00:19:55,932
- What are you doing here, sis ?
- What are you doing ?

301
00:19:56,581 --> 00:20:00,849
- Getting out my blog.
- Okay. Well, I'm getting out my blog, too.

302
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:02,108
You don't have a blog.

303
00:20:03,023 --> 00:20:04,048
I just needed to use the internet.

304
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,230
- Well, why don't you go use the one at your office ?
- 'Cause I'm not going in today.

305
00:20:07,687 --> 00:20:10,772
- Why not ?
- Because I'm not, okay ?

306
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:14,902
'Cause I'm celebrating being off bed rest, okay ?

307
00:20:15,155 --> 00:20:15,689
Okay.

308
00:20:17,631 --> 00:20:19,918
- Hello, Dave.
- Hi, Connie.

309
00:20:20,948 --> 00:20:23,045
- I read your blog again last night.
- Oh, did you ?

310
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:24,722
- I found it fascinating,
- thanks.

311
00:20:24,843 --> 00:20:27,740
- Have you explored the abandoned naval yard ?
- Listen, can you give me a minute ?

312
00:20:28,006 --> 00:20:31,358
- I'm just kind of busy right now.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

313
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,048
- Would you like a coffee ?
- No, I'm fine. Thank you.

314
00:20:46,173 --> 00:20:48,762
- Who's she ?
- Just one of my many fans.

315
00:20:50,636 --> 00:20:51,831
Listen, I want to know what's going on with you.

316
00:20:53,426 --> 00:20:53,894
What's up ?

317
00:21:01,206 --> 00:21:03,533
Did Russell ever tell you that he has a criminal record ?

318
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:05,664
No.

319
00:21:07,187 --> 00:21:09,130
Well, he does.

320
00:21:12,446 --> 00:21:13,283
You know what he did ?

321
00:21:14,966 --> 00:21:15,665
No.

322
00:21:17,143 --> 00:21:17,862
That's why I'm here.

323
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,377
Do you know where to go to find out ?

324
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:25,253
Would you do it for me ?

325
00:21:27,426 --> 00:21:27,883
Yeah.

326
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:29,599
Yeah.

327
00:21:31,236 --> 00:21:31,619
Thanks.

328
00:21:48,673 --> 00:21:49,584
you sure you want to see this ?

329
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:56,977
Yeah.

330
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:12,725
It's an adult male american alligator.

331
00:22:12,926 --> 00:22:15,744
The tumorous lesions indicate
something has defeated its immune system.

332
00:22:16,203 --> 00:22:17,201
The corpse is really bloated.

333
00:22:17,732 --> 00:22:19,295
So are you gonna tell me about your dark past ?

334
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,164
No.

335
00:22:31,639 --> 00:22:33,048
the smell is highly abnormal...

336
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,805
chemical or... I don't know.

337
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:40,222
You're gonna tell your wife though, right, Russ ?

338
00:22:45,478 --> 00:22:46,813
Tissue is necrotic and stiff...

339
00:22:48,831 --> 00:22:50,318
almost like it's been cooked inside.

340
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:53,594
You can't keep secrets from your wife, Russ.

341
00:22:53,945 --> 00:22:54,402
Mona.

342
00:22:55,164 --> 00:22:55,587
What ?

343
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:57,337
I'm gonna open the rib cage now.

344
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,014
Okay.

345
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:01,500
Can we focus on that ?

346
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:04,282
All right.

347
00:23:09,391 --> 00:23:09,995
Are you gonna give me a hand ?

348
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:11,335
Sure.

349
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,201
Oh, god.

350
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:33,552
Do you want me to help you with the heart ?

351
00:23:34,431 --> 00:23:36,373
Or do you just want to rip it out and stomp on it yourself ?

352
00:23:41,061 --> 00:23:42,356
Everyone's ready to go out to the cove, sir.

353
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:47,194
Just give the word and the dredging will begin.

354
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,262
I wouldn't be running your hand through that water, sir.

355
00:23:52,528 --> 00:23:53,481
We don't know what's in there.

356
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:57,291
I don't want anyone near this area.

357
00:23:57,676 --> 00:23:59,467
And until further notice, this is a crime scene--

358
00:23:59,768 --> 00:24:00,798
my crime scene, got it ?

359
00:24:02,284 --> 00:24:03,504
Um, what's the crime, sir ?

360
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,275
Well, somebody has obviously been dumping lethal contaminants here.

361
00:24:07,506 --> 00:24:10,367
And until we find out who, I want this entire area cordoned off.

362
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:12,923
But this is the park, sir.

363
00:24:13,154 --> 00:24:14,600
I don't care if it's the white house rose garden.

364
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:15,752
I want it cordoned off.

365
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:17,773
And if the park super has a problem with that,

366
00:24:17,808 --> 00:24:19,295
you tell him to give me a call, all right ?

367
00:24:20,096 --> 00:24:21,210
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

368
00:24:22,985 --> 00:24:25,120
And are we gonna dredge biscayne cove, sir ?

369
00:24:26,149 --> 00:24:26,836
I'll let you know.

370
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:29,964
I'll let you know.

371
00:24:32,322 --> 00:24:32,969
Do you have a good lawyer ?

372
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,167
- I'm not gonna need a lawyer.
- You might, if Hemming has his way.

373
00:24:36,784 --> 00:24:39,226
Hemming's a scum. He's a pretty powerful scum.

374
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,590
And his brother's even more powerful scum.

375
00:24:45,591 --> 00:24:47,343
All right, give me the towel.

376
00:24:47,686 --> 00:24:48,564
I'm gonna open up the stomach.

377
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:50,126
Hey, Russ...

378
00:24:51,802 --> 00:24:52,566
oh, my god.

379
00:24:54,852 --> 00:24:55,882
What are you guys doing ?

380
00:24:56,574 --> 00:24:57,221
A necropsy.

381
00:24:58,629 --> 00:24:59,963
Oh, god, that's disgusting.

382
00:25:07,889 --> 00:25:08,385
What are you doing ?

383
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:10,298
Larkin's really upset with you.

384
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:12,508
You see ?

385
00:25:14,726 --> 00:25:15,450
Yeah. She, uh...

386
00:25:17,128 --> 00:25:18,810
she knows about what happened when you were a kid.

387
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:22,623
What does she know ?

388
00:25:24,563 --> 00:25:27,356
I pulled up your criminal record online for her.

389
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:33,458
I'll just talk to her when I get home.

390
00:25:33,955 --> 00:25:34,677
Why didn't you just tell her ?

391
00:25:41,347 --> 00:25:42,258
what, what, what, what ?

392
00:25:42,757 --> 00:25:43,708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa !

393
00:25:56,777 --> 00:25:57,197
You all right ?

394
00:26:06,911 --> 00:26:08,168
holy crow.

395
00:26:10,592 --> 00:26:13,448
Do we have any idea what we're looking at here ?

396
00:26:18,523 --> 00:26:21,929
I hope you're all sitting down right now,
because I have got some major news.

397
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:25,330
The eagle has landed.That's right, bloggers.

398
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:30,476
We found an actual piece of an alien life-form in the belly of a gator.

399
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:32,609
Ah, dreams do come true.

400
00:26:32,951 --> 00:26:34,934
First thing Tomorrow morning, you're gonna find outall about it

401
00:26:35,555 --> 00:26:38,217
because yours truly is going to be answering all of your questions

402
00:26:38,252 --> 00:26:40,466
live from my favorite internet café.

403
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,487
And for those of you who can't wait that long,

404
00:26:43,403 --> 00:26:47,400
well, I suppose that I could divulge a few of the little secrets--

405
00:26:48,302 --> 00:26:49,272
the highlights, if you will...

406
00:26:52,812 --> 00:26:55,365
it was about a foot long,8 inches thick,

407
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:58,186
with a single prod shooting through the middle of it.

408
00:26:58,605 --> 00:27:00,897
It is orange-pink in colorand actually looks

409
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:02,728
a little bit more like a piece of chicken

410
00:27:02,763 --> 00:27:04,558
than anything you'd expect to find in another galaxy.

411
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:06,655
But it is definitely extraterrestrial.

412
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,816
It came out covered in this acid slime

413
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:11,834
that chewed right through our floorboards.

414
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:14,770
And although this is the most extraordinary find,

415
00:27:15,608 --> 00:27:18,162
my silly brother-in-law Russellstill refuses to call in nasa.

416
00:27:19,228 --> 00:27:21,099
Right now, actually, he's a little bit distractedwith my sister.

417
00:27:21,934 --> 00:27:22,699
No one ever thought that...

418
00:27:27,221 --> 00:27:28,251
we'll have more on that later.

419
00:27:33,204 --> 00:27:33,888
Larkin ?

420
00:27:36,977 --> 00:27:37,815
Larkin, you here ?

421
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:43,377
Dave ! Larkin's not here.

422
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:46,204
Yeah, I know. She said she was going out to johnson pond again.

423
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:47,464
Oh, great.

424
00:27:48,327 --> 00:27:48,913
Oh, she'll be okay, man.

425
00:27:49,144 --> 00:27:50,552
She was upset, but she's not gonna do anything crazy

426
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:52,038
I want to go talk to her.

427
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:55,201
What about the thing we found inside the gator ?

428
00:27:56,038 --> 00:27:56,809
Mona took it to the lab.

429
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,409
We should have results back in an hour or so.

430
00:27:59,438 --> 00:28:00,316
You know this is huge, don't you ?

431
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:02,334
You found a piece of the rock, Russell--

432
00:28:03,594 --> 00:28:05,161
a chunk of a real E.B.E.You're gonna be a star.

433
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:06,723
You know ?

434
00:28:07,676 --> 00:28:08,820
All right, all right,Russell--Russ, Russ !

435
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:09,622
What ?

436
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:13,393
Look, just... tell her the truth, okay ?

437
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,346
That's what she wants to hear right now.

438
00:28:16,491 --> 00:28:17,671
She just wants to know who you really are.

439
00:28:21,029 --> 00:28:22,016
Good luck !

440
00:28:36,291 --> 00:28:36,786
Okay.

441
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:39,949
Okay what ?

442
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,227
I've got a team, and they're going to the cove.

443
00:28:48,985 --> 00:28:49,592
You ready ?

444
00:28:53,367 --> 00:28:54,087
I'll meet you there.

445
00:28:57,523 --> 00:28:57,974
All right.

446
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:06,336
Larkin ?

447
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,201
I, uh, I came out here to apologize.

448
00:29:23,746 --> 00:29:25,649
I don't know if an apology is gonna cut it, Russell.

449
00:29:30,413 --> 00:29:31,442
Can I tell you a story then ?

450
00:29:36,891 --> 00:29:37,348
Okay.

451
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:44,167
When I was 10 years old, I got off the boat from cuba,

452
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:47,637
and I moved in with my uncle Max.

453
00:29:48,473 --> 00:29:49,542
He was my only family here,

454
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,046
and I had to respect him because that's what you do.

455
00:29:54,081 --> 00:29:56,027
But I didn't like him. He wasn't a nice person.

456
00:29:57,628 --> 00:29:58,655
He treated people miserably.

457
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:00,835
He was also a gangster.

458
00:30:02,015 --> 00:30:06,066
He owned a lot of crooked businesses.
He sold a lot of drugs, mostly coke.

459
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:10,109
And by the time I was 17, I was selling it for him.

460
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,385
Look, I didn't like it. I never used it.

461
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:16,507
But I sold it

462
00:30:17,538 --> 00:30:20,976
'cause if I didn't, he'd beat the hell out of me.

463
00:30:22,346 --> 00:30:24,750
I saw him punch his girlfriend once so hard,
he put her eye out.

464
00:30:25,322 --> 00:30:27,610
And she stayed with him after that.
That's how sick it was.

465
00:30:31,192 --> 00:30:32,562
And one day--I had this friend Leon.

466
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:37,790
Leon was this...he was this little guy.

467
00:30:37,825 --> 00:30:39,012
He was a really sweet kid.

468
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:41,079
He'd always come over to the house

469
00:30:41,114 --> 00:30:42,488
and hang out with me sometimes.

470
00:30:44,127 --> 00:30:45,232
My uncle would always make fun of him.

471
00:30:47,098 --> 00:30:48,355
He'd always make fun of the way he talked

472
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:50,039
because he had this speech impediment,

473
00:30:50,074 --> 00:30:51,298
and he'd mock him.

474
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,099
One day, I just told my uncle to shut up.

475
00:30:58,386 --> 00:31:00,138
I'd had it. I didn't want to hear it anymore.

476
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,738
And instead of hitting me, or even getting angry at me...

477
00:31:09,093 --> 00:31:10,882
he takes out a gun and he shoots leon.

478
00:31:11,417 --> 00:31:12,868
And then he starts laughing.

479
00:31:15,683 --> 00:31:17,742
He tells me to get a rag to clean the blood off the carpet.

480
00:31:21,628 --> 00:31:23,192
And I guess something in me just snapped,

481
00:31:23,227 --> 00:31:27,001
'cause I grabbed this statue off my uncle's desk,

482
00:31:27,036 --> 00:31:28,830
this stupid statue of a guy on a horse,

483
00:31:28,865 --> 00:31:30,594
and I just slammed it into his skull.

484
00:31:32,838 --> 00:31:35,429
And the police came, and they took his body away,

485
00:31:35,464 --> 00:31:36,877
and they took leon's body away.

486
00:31:38,135 --> 00:31:38,822
They arrested me.

487
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:46,141
I was a minor, and my lawyer argued that I'd killed my uncle in self-defense,

488
00:31:47,928 --> 00:31:51,513
so I got off light, and the judge sent me to a detention camp...

489
00:31:53,531 --> 00:31:54,712
here in the everglades...

490
00:31:58,485 --> 00:31:59,893
which is how I fell in love with this place...

491
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,924
and where I fell in love with you.

492
00:32:17,213 --> 00:32:18,965
Why didn't you tell me this before ?

493
00:32:22,852 --> 00:32:24,071
It's a hard story to tell.

494
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:32,073
Because I didn't kill my uncle in self-defense, Larkin.

495
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:37,412
I killed him because he deserved it.

496
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:35,447
hey, doc.

497
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:38,763
hey.

498
00:33:39,106 --> 00:33:40,476
You're listening to my old buddy holly records.

499
00:33:41,012 --> 00:33:41,468
Yeah.

500
00:33:42,917 --> 00:33:43,791
And you're drinking my beer.

501
00:33:44,174 --> 00:33:46,689
yeah, how about that ?My second one.

502
00:33:49,206 --> 00:33:50,443
- Hope you don't mind.
- No.

503
00:33:52,125 --> 00:33:53,654
So did you get off work early or something ?

504
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,403
I'm on my way to biscayne cove.

505
00:33:57,005 --> 00:33:57,690
What's out there ?

506
00:33:59,403 --> 00:33:59,900
Water.

507
00:34:00,589 --> 00:34:01,166
Yeah.

508
00:34:04,305 --> 00:34:05,523
I was taking a look at your clippings.

509
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:08,191
You've got some pretty interesting stuff here.

510
00:34:08,534 --> 00:34:10,022
Yeah. That's just, uh...

511
00:34:11,013 --> 00:34:12,155
that's just, uh...

512
00:34:13,566 --> 00:34:14,899
uh, it's research.

513
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:18,561
I'm not a pod person, Dave.

514
00:34:21,379 --> 00:34:21,836
Okay.

515
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:28,165
But I am different...

516
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,763
in a way I can't explain.

517
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,256
You said you saw something in the water.

518
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:43,836
What did you see ?

519
00:34:50,058 --> 00:34:51,153
I, uh...

520
00:34:55,803 --> 00:34:56,260
Mariel...

521
00:34:57,754 --> 00:34:58,212
I don't...

522
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:02,098
no, no, no, no. Don't back off now.

523
00:35:03,019 --> 00:35:03,554
I have to know.

524
00:35:09,909 --> 00:35:11,282
Doctor-patient privilege.

525
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,097
Okay.

526
00:35:32,278 --> 00:35:33,000
What did you see ?

527
00:35:34,638 --> 00:35:35,782
Have you ever heard of an E.B.E. ?

528
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:37,879
No.

529
00:35:38,566 --> 00:35:39,373
It's an acronym.

530
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,038
It stands for extraterrestrial biological entity.

531
00:35:47,302 --> 00:35:50,029
- So you saw a martian ?
- No. No, no.

532
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:54,754
I saw a bright orange...

533
00:35:57,345 --> 00:35:58,032
something...

534
00:35:59,708 --> 00:36:00,585
that attacked me.

535
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:05,348
Russell told you that a gator did this.

536
00:36:06,262 --> 00:36:06,871
Remember ?

537
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:11,332
A gator did not do that.

538
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:14,722
I'm sure it was an E.B.E.

539
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:18,155
What did you see in the water ?

540
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:25,623
Me.

541
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:52,609
How much longer do you want me to do this ?

542
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:55,894
Have they looked everywhere ?

543
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:58,457
Every square inch.

544
00:37:00,666 --> 00:37:01,391
Twice.

545
00:37:04,325 --> 00:37:05,240
I know what I saw, Tom.

546
00:37:08,497 --> 00:37:09,168
Okay.

547
00:37:10,841 --> 00:37:11,453
All right.

548
00:37:14,548 --> 00:37:15,349
<i>Russ, you out there ?</i>

549
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,408
Yeah, Mona.

550
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:21,262
<i>I got the preliminary test results back from the lab.</i>

551
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:22,559
And ?

552
00:37:24,108 --> 00:37:26,290
The thing's filled with all kinds of poisons.

553
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,745
It definitely killed that gator,

554
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:29,510
probably everything else around it.

555
00:37:30,423 --> 00:37:31,681
That's not the scary part.

556
00:37:33,052 --> 00:37:34,768
They may have found some human D.N.A.

557
00:37:35,916 --> 00:37:36,259
What ?

558
00:37:36,907 --> 00:37:37,596
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

559
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:39,354
They won't be certain for a couple of days,

560
00:37:39,389 --> 00:37:40,496
but what's up with that ?

561
00:37:41,343 --> 00:37:43,090
That thing didn't look like any human I've ever seen.

562
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:59,831
I was gonna put back on the tie again,
but then I figured,why push ?

563
00:38:01,852 --> 00:38:07,643
I came in here this morning expecting you all to be
a bunch of kool-aid swiggers.

564
00:38:10,007 --> 00:38:12,674
But I've really come around.

565
00:38:14,238 --> 00:38:14,627
Really.

566
00:38:16,196 --> 00:38:17,759
One of your own, actually, set me straight.

567
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:20,996
I think I get it now.

568
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:28,128
You're all just people who are looking
to find someone to share the experience with, right ?

569
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:34,724
So if...if you guys don't mind,

570
00:38:36,244 --> 00:38:38,149
I'd really like to keep coming back here for a little while.

571
00:38:40,168 --> 00:38:43,219
I can share my stories with you.

572
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,322
You can share your stories with me.

573
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,596
And, uh, who knows ?

574
00:38:48,631 --> 00:38:50,466
Maybe together we could change the world.

575
00:38:57,412 --> 00:38:57,833
All right.

576
00:39:00,392 --> 00:39:00,858
Okay.

577
00:39:16,794 --> 00:39:18,287
I think I got them right where I want them.

578
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,102
- Mare...
- I know.

579
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:40,362
- You've done everything you could
- I wish I could do more.

580
00:39:42,075 --> 00:39:43,449
sheriff ! We got something !

581
00:39:55,114 --> 00:39:55,644
Mariel.

582
00:39:59,837 --> 00:40:00,866
It was caught down deep.

583
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:08,602
Show me the face.

584
00:40:13,174 --> 00:40:14,089
I want to see the face.

585
00:40:15,346 --> 00:40:15,845
It's all right.

586
00:40:23,503 --> 00:40:25,370
Get on her I.D. Run it across the missing list.

587
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:40,576
I was so sure.

588
00:40:43,129 --> 00:40:46,255
You were sure because you did see a body.

589
00:40:48,197 --> 00:40:49,113
But it wasn't you.

590
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:53,686
It wasn't you.
