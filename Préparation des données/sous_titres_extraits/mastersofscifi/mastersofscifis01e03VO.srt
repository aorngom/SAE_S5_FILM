00:00:03,897 --> 00:00:05,549
<i>From the very beginning,</i>

2
00:00:05,737 --> 00:00:08,028
<i>we have wondered
how life began,</i>

3
00:00:08,323 --> 00:00:11,835
<i>what our purpose is
and where we are headed.</i>

4
00:00:16,544 --> 00:00:19,145
<i>We have struggled
to understand time,</i>

5
00:00:19,388 --> 00:00:21,960
<i>matter, the infinite universe,</i>

6
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:25,511
<i>who we are and if we are alone.</i>

7
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:32,594
<i>Great minds have imagined
the most wonderful</i>

8
00:00:32,806 --> 00:00:36,571
<i>and the most terrifying answers
to these questions.</i>

9
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:41,453
<i>We invite you to join us
on this great expedition.</i>

00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,119
Company halt.

12
00:00:48,517 --> 00:00:50,132
Sweep the mines, Joes.

13
00:00:56,246 --> 00:00:58,772
<i>If necessity is
the mother of invention,</i>

14
00:00:59,182 --> 00:01:01,080
<i>what will drive our ingenuity</i>

15
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,898
<i>when all our needs
have been fulfilled?</i>

16
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,931
Mr. and Mrs. Van Vogel,
Tibor Cargrew.

17
00:01:50,449 --> 00:01:51,642
How do you do?

18
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:55,626
Welcome to Controlled Genetics.

19
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:57,880
Walk this way.

20
00:02:01,635 --> 00:02:02,680
Wait.

21
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:06,489
Here at Controlled Genetics,
we don't try.

22
00:02:06,813 --> 00:02:07,922
We just do.

23
00:02:08,042 --> 00:02:09,386
That's very profound thinking.

24
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:12,393
Yes, from people whose wisdom
comes from reading t-shirts.

25
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:15,265
Oh, arrogance and money.
I like that combination.

26
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:16,825
Well, we have buckets of both.

27
00:02:16,945 --> 00:02:19,266
Let me take you on a little tour
on the way to my office.

28
00:02:19,386 --> 00:02:22,213
A private tour, yes? We don't have
to share it with anyone, do we?

29
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,460
No one from the--
What do you call it? The public.

30
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,418
Good lord, no.
What do you take me for?

31
00:02:26,538 --> 00:02:28,272
- Sigret, boss?
- What?

32
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:29,899
Sigret.

33
00:02:30,755 --> 00:02:32,028
I think he wants a cigarette.

34
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:33,309
Get back to work, Joe.

35
00:02:33,431 --> 00:02:35,957
Jerry. Uh...
Jerry like sigret.

36
00:02:36,089 --> 00:02:39,159
No, Jerry, cigarettes are bad
for you, very bad for you.

37
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:42,984
- Jerry like candy.
- I like candy, too.

38
00:02:43,104 --> 00:02:45,377
- Don't encourage him, Brownie.
- Get back to work.

39
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:48,655
This way.

40
00:02:52,902 --> 00:02:53,906
Sigret?

41
00:02:57,513 --> 00:02:59,719
This is the plasto-biology atrium.

42
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:02,135
I hope you like it.
I designed it.

43
00:03:02,314 --> 00:03:03,994
- Oh, did you?
- Yes.

44
00:03:04,986 --> 00:03:08,766
And here is a little display
of who we are and what we do.

45
00:03:08,886 --> 00:03:10,534
<i>Welcome to the Joe nursery.</i>

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,435
<i>Baby Joes don't cry real tears.</i>

47
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:17,651
Before we can assign

48
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:20,267
the workers to the job
that they were built for,

49
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,282
we take them
out of the hatchery,

50
00:03:22,402 --> 00:03:24,541
and then they go through
their first operation

51
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:26,910
to meld the plasto
with the biological.

52
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:30,600
Mrs. Van Vogel,
may I have a word, please?

53
00:03:31,509 --> 00:03:33,706
Have you ever considered any...

54
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,260
plasto-biology for yourself?

55
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,523
- What?
- How old are you now, 100?

56
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:41,363
85.
I'm only 85.

57
00:03:41,841 --> 00:03:44,461
Must be the lighting in here.
Please, over here.

58
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:46,922
<i>Radiation doesn't stop the Joe.</i>

59
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,719
<i>Radiation can be fun
if you're a Joe.</i>

60
00:03:48,839 --> 00:03:52,115
That is a glowboy, isn't it?
Isn't that a glowboy?

61
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:55,411
Brownie, you know a new word.
Wh-what's a glowboy?

62
00:03:55,975 --> 00:03:57,935
That's a clean-up Joe
at a nuclear reactor.

63
00:03:58,055 --> 00:03:59,111
They don't last long.

64
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:01,657
Believe it or not,
it's cheaper than getting the locals

65
00:04:01,913 --> 00:04:04,843
to do the same job for 3 cents
and a Bob Marley t-shirt.

66
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:07,903
The best thing about it is,
no health insurance.

67
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:11,101
You know, it used to be
very dangerous work.

68
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:12,445
Now the Joes do it.

69
00:04:12,634 --> 00:04:14,970
You won't see any of these things
applying early decision

70
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:16,624
at Cornel, eh, Cargrew?

71
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:19,169
Yeah... over here.

72
00:04:21,755 --> 00:04:24,628
- Now over here, we've...
- Double soy latte.

73
00:04:25,174 --> 00:04:26,282
Very good.

74
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:30,179
We've just received an order
for 25,000 of these Joes.

75
00:04:30,453 --> 00:04:33,877
So they'll be working at
a certain chain of coffeehouse

76
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:35,693
which I'm not
at liberty to name,

77
00:04:36,187 --> 00:04:38,061
but suffice to say,
there'll be no more

78
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:40,553
of those little tip jars
by the cash register.

79
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:43,288
- You know what I'm saying?
- Tipping, us?

80
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,921
<i>Would you like
a muffin with your coffee?</i>

81
00:04:52,957 --> 00:04:55,013
Fellow at the club
comes into the club...

82
00:04:55,377 --> 00:04:56,666
The Bradbury club...

83
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,480
They woudn't let you in,
because, well, you work.

84
00:05:00,475 --> 00:05:02,833
We're there every day,
our usual place,

85
00:05:02,953 --> 00:05:05,250
having our usual conversation...

86
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:09,913
And since
they're only $50,000 each,

87
00:05:10,716 --> 00:05:11,740
we'll get both.

88
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,251
Why don't we just get all three?

89
00:05:18,879 --> 00:05:20,832
Pudgy, you know the rules.

90
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:23,676
Pudgy, you know the rules.

91
00:05:23,796 --> 00:05:25,946
No dogs except seeing

92
00:05:26,206 --> 00:05:27,967
eye dogs allowed
inside the club.

93
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,532
And since we don't accept
the blind as members...

94
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:33,988
And since we don't accept
the blind as members,

95
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:35,120
no dogs at all.

96
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:38,404
Oh, my God!
Is there a dog in the clubhouse?

97
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:40,320
That's a dog, Pudg.

98
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,612
No, not legally.

99
00:05:42,922 --> 00:05:44,969
You're not a real dog,
are you, boy?

100
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,456
I'm not a real dog.

101
00:05:46,576 --> 00:05:50,084
I'm a plasto-biological hybrid.
Yes, yes, yes, yes...

102
00:05:50,355 --> 00:05:52,465
A plasto-biological hybrid.

103
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:54,910
And I only cost $1 million.

104
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:56,643
I'm the million-dollar puppy!

105
00:05:56,978 --> 00:05:58,828
The million-dollar puppy.

106
00:06:01,158 --> 00:06:03,090
A 6-legged Dachshund.

107
00:06:03,368 --> 00:06:05,109
And he made a fool out of us.

108
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,834
We want to come back with
something... more impressive.

109
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,074
What, like an 8-legged Dachshund?

110
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,331
We don't do Dachshunds.

111
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:14,776
Funny little dogs...
just not us.

112
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,613
Vulgar, grotesque.

113
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:18,998
It's your idea, Brownie.
You can tell him.

114
00:06:19,683 --> 00:06:23,702
$500 million,
and he thinks he's rich.

115
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:28,231
$500 million,
and he thinks he has the right

116
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,230
to make fun of us, to show off.

117
00:06:31,408 --> 00:06:32,873
A million bucks...

118
00:06:34,967 --> 00:06:37,869
And a 6-legged wiener buys him
a few minutes of attention.

119
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:41,588
What kind of designer animal
do you think it would take

120
00:06:42,238 --> 00:06:45,025
to burn that smile
off his fat face?

121
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,793
I have an idea.

122
00:06:48,056 --> 00:06:49,610
Oh, I have a very good idea.

123
00:06:49,849 --> 00:06:51,282
Will it cost lots of money?

124
00:06:51,402 --> 00:06:54,547
Oh... so much, so very much.

125
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:57,201
I like it!

126
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:03,294
- What?
- Pegasus.

127
00:07:03,792 --> 00:07:05,251
I want a flying horse.

128
00:07:05,371 --> 00:07:07,733
I want to land on the roof
of the club on a flying horse.

129
00:07:07,853 --> 00:07:09,049
Big gold wings...

130
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:11,802
then I want that flying horse
to step on that damn Dachshund

131
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:14,984
and squeeze all the Dachshund
out of it like a Dachshund burrito.

132
00:07:15,307 --> 00:07:17,162
A Dachshund isn't
even a decent animal

133
00:07:17,282 --> 00:07:19,401
when it has
the regulation four legs.

134
00:07:19,885 --> 00:07:20,912
You know what I'm saying.

135
00:07:21,032 --> 00:07:22,728
We want it as fast
as you can make it.

136
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,565
A pegasus... How much?

137
00:07:24,825 --> 00:07:26,940
Oh, just hold on a second.

138
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,177
I want to show you something.

139
00:07:29,318 --> 00:07:31,447
The seventh richest woman
in the world

140
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:34,285
just told you what she wants.
Get it for her.

141
00:07:34,616 --> 00:07:37,464
Just hold your genetically
unmodified horses, Brownie.

142
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:41,221
I want you to meet someone
very special.

143
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:47,129
Is he going to bring out someone
retarded and ask us for charity?

144
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:49,168
If he does, we'll walk out.

145
00:07:50,989 --> 00:07:52,059
Thank you.

146
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,136
Someone very special, indeed.

147
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:00,267
Come on, come on.

148
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:02,476
Come on, come on.

149
00:08:03,595 --> 00:08:05,606
A baby elephant!

150
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:09,151
Oh, look, Bron, a baby elephant.

151
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,064
Where is your mommy?

152
00:08:11,418 --> 00:08:14,625
Actually, ahem, I'm his mommy,
and he's not a baby.

153
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:18,314
Oh, yes, he is.
He's a vewy young elephant.

154
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:21,208
In spite of the quaint way
that you are addressing him,

155
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:25,094
he really is a fully grown,
fully formed adult.

156
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,609
<i>Je vous présente, Napoléon.</i>

157
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,175
What?

158
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,677
He said,
"I present to you Napoleon."

159
00:08:32,978 --> 00:08:34,405
It's French.

160
00:08:37,689 --> 00:08:40,074
For the price I'm sure you're asking,
that's the least.

161
00:08:40,194 --> 00:08:43,727
For the price we're asking,
he can read and write.

162
00:08:44,185 --> 00:08:47,593
Oh, what beautiful writing.

163
00:08:49,293 --> 00:08:50,506
He likes me!

164
00:08:50,901 --> 00:08:53,281
Oh, look, Bron, he likes me.

165
00:08:53,401 --> 00:08:56,234
He doesn't even know me,
and he likes me.

166
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,009
I want a horse, Martha.

167
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,811
Get the horse, if you want it.
I want the baby elephant.

168
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:02,980
Um, actually, he's not a baby.

169
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,866
He's full grown, and he comes
with his own little bed.

170
00:09:05,998 --> 00:09:07,378
Oh, sweetie...

171
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,534
Does anyone else
have one of these things?

172
00:09:10,654 --> 00:09:11,666
Oh, good lord.

173
00:09:11,786 --> 00:09:14,172
I wouldn't dare show him to you
if you weren't the first.

174
00:09:15,979 --> 00:09:19,162
- How much?
- $3,350,000.

175
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:22,109
- Oh, write the check, Bron.
- I just don't think that

176
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,991
a scribbling elephant is going
to trump pudgy's Dachshund.

177
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:27,566
- What about the pegasus?
- Get the pegasus if you want it.

178
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,622
Napoleon makes me give up
all thoughts of ego and revenge.

179
00:09:32,168 --> 00:09:35,229
He makes me want to be
pure and good and kind.

180
00:09:35,622 --> 00:09:38,756
Anyway, we couldn't possibly
supply you with a pegasus today.

181
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:42,393
You don't want us to have
a pegasus, and I know why...

182
00:09:43,318 --> 00:09:45,938
Because you don't know how
to graft wings on a horse.

183
00:09:47,074 --> 00:09:50,618
I don't know how
to graft wings on a horse?

184
00:09:52,197 --> 00:09:54,423
That's like saying
the creator of "Bugs Bunny"

185
00:09:54,683 --> 00:09:57,202
wouldn't know how
to animate a bouncing ball.

186
00:09:57,893 --> 00:10:00,852
Look here, Brownie,
you're not the first

187
00:10:00,972 --> 00:10:03,486
cabana boy to come waltzin
in here with his wife's money,

188
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:06,734
- asking for pegasus.
- I have never been so insulted.

189
00:10:07,771 --> 00:10:10,723
- Who's Bugs Bunny?
- Let me explain something to you.

190
00:10:11,731 --> 00:10:15,153
I can make you a living thing...
I won't call it an animal...

191
00:10:15,405 --> 00:10:18,109
The size and the shape...
of this table here.

192
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:20,821
Alive?
Yeah, but good for what?

193
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:22,003
Ingesting food?

194
00:10:22,172 --> 00:10:24,604
Making chemical energy,
doing doo-doo?

195
00:10:24,745 --> 00:10:26,623
Displaying irritability...

196
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:29,901
Come on, it's a stupid,
silly manipulation.

197
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,348
Mechanically,
a table and a horse

198
00:10:32,471 --> 00:10:33,796
are two very different things.

199
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:37,335
Sure,

200
00:10:39,259 --> 00:10:40,855
I could make you a winged horse.

201
00:10:41,315 --> 00:10:44,273
- You just said you couldn't.
- Permission not granted to interrupt.

202
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:45,998
I said I could make you

203
00:10:46,276 --> 00:10:47,608
a winged horse.

204
00:10:48,383 --> 00:10:49,463
It just won't fly.

205
00:10:49,993 --> 00:10:53,232
An animal is a machine.
It's a heat engine that uses levers

206
00:10:53,492 --> 00:10:54,883
and hydraulic systems.

207
00:10:55,428 --> 00:10:57,069
You savvy aerodynamics?

208
00:10:57,329 --> 00:10:58,362
I have a jet,

209
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:00,796
- of course.
- Do you run your jet on hay?

210
00:11:01,272 --> 00:11:02,366
Because a horse

211
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:04,640
is a hay-burner.

212
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:08,538
An aerodynamic horse would
need a breastbone 10 feet wide,

213
00:11:08,658 --> 00:11:10,377
a wingspan of 80 feet.

214
00:11:11,015 --> 00:11:14,918
Folded, its wings would
cover it like a huge tent.

215
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,834
If I were you, I'd be saying,

216
00:11:21,491 --> 00:11:24,308
"Cargrew, you're a whore.

217
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,863
"What the world needs is
the return of the gulf current.

218
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:31,642
"What the world needs
is cures for cancer,

219
00:11:31,762 --> 00:11:33,957
"swine flu and inherited wealth.

220
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:36,710
"And what are you doing?
What are you doing?

221
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,604
"You're acting
like a French toy maker

222
00:11:38,724 --> 00:11:41,930
"two years before they cut off
the head of Marie Antoinette,

223
00:11:42,424 --> 00:11:44,490
"supplying
the parasite classes with

224
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:47,723
"grotesque diversions
like opera-singing cuckoo clocks,

225
00:11:47,843 --> 00:11:51,163
"when you should be out there
manning the barricades,

226
00:11:51,334 --> 00:11:54,554
"chief engineer
to a 10-seat guillotine.

227
00:11:55,653 --> 00:11:59,935
"Instead, you're making
miniature elephants.

228
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:02,842
"You're disgusting, Cargrew,

229
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:07,898
"a pathetic representative
of science gone bad...

230
00:12:08,548 --> 00:12:10,369
"gone way bad."

231
00:12:18,555 --> 00:12:21,297
Well, that's what
I would be saying, and more,

232
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:25,093
but I'm through giving the enemy
all my best ammunition.

233
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,526
My husband is not a cabana boy.

234
00:12:28,947 --> 00:12:30,083
He's a caddie.

235
00:12:30,937 --> 00:12:32,167
There's a difference...

236
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:35,221
And we'll take the elephant.

237
00:12:41,918 --> 00:12:43,252
Do I really look 100?

238
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,843
- No, no.
- Oh, what do you think I need?

239
00:12:48,828 --> 00:12:50,641
We'll talk later.

240
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:55,518
Well, that's Jerry.

241
00:12:56,369 --> 00:12:58,012
What's he doing?
Where are they going?

242
00:12:58,998 --> 00:13:00,256
Well, wait.

243
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,283
That Joe, Jerry...
He just said something to me.

244
00:13:03,584 --> 00:13:06,653
- Oh, forget about him.
- No, no, I think he was saying,

245
00:13:06,935 --> 00:13:08,165
"Help me."

246
00:13:08,526 --> 00:13:10,212
"Help me"? Good lord, no.

247
00:13:12,253 --> 00:13:14,873
Ah, no, what he was saying was,
"kill me."

248
00:13:15,258 --> 00:13:17,397
Yes, "kill me."
They all say that near the end.

249
00:13:17,688 --> 00:13:18,961
You're going to kill him?

250
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,116
Well, this batch
is scheduled for liquidation

251
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:23,584
in what, two or three days?
When's processing?

252
00:13:23,704 --> 00:13:24,851
<i>Two hours.</i>

253
00:13:24,971 --> 00:13:26,537
Oh, there you are. Two hours.

254
00:13:26,657 --> 00:13:29,024
- Two hours.
- He's going to die.

255
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:32,769
- We're all going to die.
- Well, I know that,

256
00:13:32,889 --> 00:13:34,834
but we're not
dying on schedule.

257
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:41,030
<i>Next.</i>

258
00:13:44,328 --> 00:13:45,558
Oh, my.

259
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,866
<i>This way, move it through.</i>

260
00:13:47,986 --> 00:13:49,002
Candy.

261
00:13:52,635 --> 00:13:53,705
Candy.

262
00:13:54,193 --> 00:13:56,099
Candy, please, missy.
Candy.

263
00:13:56,558 --> 00:13:58,868
- Hello, Jerry.
- Candy, missy?

264
00:14:03,787 --> 00:14:06,242
Here, Jerry.
A candy, a mint.

265
00:14:07,195 --> 00:14:09,345
Sankoo, missy.
Me Jerry.

266
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:11,718
How do you do, Jerry?

267
00:14:11,862 --> 00:14:12,886
Howdy, missy.

268
00:14:13,006 --> 00:14:15,162
This is not a good idea.

269
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:19,126
Well, Bronson, doesn't he look
exactly like uncle Albert,

270
00:14:19,782 --> 00:14:21,294
except that he's so sad?

271
00:14:21,763 --> 00:14:23,708
Jerry, why are you so sad?

272
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:26,120
Ask a spare tire
to describe a rose.

273
00:14:26,357 --> 00:14:29,089
- Joes don't have abstract reasoning.
- Jerry sad.

274
00:14:29,953 --> 00:14:31,133
Well, he answered.

275
00:14:31,253 --> 00:14:32,976
No, he spoke.
He didn't answer.

276
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:35,500
Why, Jerry?
Why are you so sad?

277
00:14:36,237 --> 00:14:38,349
Oh, no work,

278
00:14:38,706 --> 00:14:40,951
no sigret, no candy.

279
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:42,555
No work.

280
00:14:43,361 --> 00:14:45,981
What happened?
What was he designed for?

281
00:14:46,226 --> 00:14:48,921
Well, let me see.
This batch were...

282
00:14:49,381 --> 00:14:50,963
Uh, minesweepers for the army.

283
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,461
We tried to retrain them
as carpet cleaners,

284
00:14:53,581 --> 00:14:55,630
floor polishing,
even as gardeners,

285
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:58,789
but their genetically imprinted
pattern that they walk

286
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:01,846
doesn't include them
getting around the furniture.

287
00:15:02,115 --> 00:15:03,373
Joe, walk the field.

288
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,227
Jerry walk the field.

289
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:07,229
Jerry? Joe walk the field.

290
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:11,037
See?

291
00:15:11,408 --> 00:15:13,526
Jerry walk the field,
walk the field, Jerry.

292
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:16,061
No boom. Get candy?

293
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,694
Get sigret?

294
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,075
He was sent into minefields?

295
00:15:21,195 --> 00:15:23,468
Yes, well,
obviously he made it out.

296
00:15:23,827 --> 00:15:25,254
But Jerry wants to work.

297
00:15:25,498 --> 00:15:27,667
Work? Oh, sure, Mike.

298
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,312
Good work.

299
00:15:29,716 --> 00:15:31,547
Uh, Jerry walk the field.

300
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:34,401
One step, one step, one step.

301
00:15:35,594 --> 00:15:36,664
No boom.

302
00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:38,683
Safe, safe.

303
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,833
You're going to kill him,
and he wants to work?

304
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,763
Look, let me just tell you this.

305
00:15:43,412 --> 00:15:45,872
He was trained and bred
to be blown up.

306
00:15:46,714 --> 00:15:48,888
And now the army
has no further use for him,

307
00:15:49,008 --> 00:15:50,216
there's nothing for him to do.

308
00:15:50,338 --> 00:15:51,696
So all we're doing is just

309
00:15:51,988 --> 00:15:53,941
trimming off the bad parts
of his life,

310
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,711
and don't forget,
the Joes wouldn't be here

311
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:59,958
if we hadn't been here,
because we invented them.

312
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:03,132
How much?
How much what?

313
00:16:03,282 --> 00:16:05,291
How much will it cost me
to buy him from you?

314
00:16:05,856 --> 00:16:07,326
And how many parakeets
did you buy

315
00:16:07,446 --> 00:16:11,034
from the pet store this morning
so you could let them all fly free?

316
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:13,419
You wanna save that Joe
from dog food?

317
00:16:14,145 --> 00:16:15,629
You turn them into dog food?

318
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:18,241
A very good large breed
puppy food, actually,

319
00:16:18,361 --> 00:16:19,964
- high in protein.
- Oh, my god.

320
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:21,305
This is our business, baby.

321
00:16:21,425 --> 00:16:22,840
We sell everything
but the oink.

322
00:16:23,131 --> 00:16:24,803
Anyway,
he's already been paid for.

323
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:27,069
Come on, toots.

324
00:16:27,335 --> 00:16:29,917
I mean, you're one of the richest
women on the planet.

325
00:16:30,143 --> 00:16:31,693
How'd you think the world works?

326
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:34,031
- I...
- That's my fault.

327
00:16:34,291 --> 00:16:36,598
I work very hard to keep her
happy and amused and...

328
00:16:36,793 --> 00:16:38,456
distract her
from the pain of the world.

329
00:16:38,576 --> 00:16:41,632
Except the Joes
don't feel any pain.

330
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:44,213
There, you heard it, Martha.
See? They don't feel pain.

331
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,852
But if he likes candy,
he feels pleasure.

332
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,093
But it's not the same
as you and I wanting, honey.

333
00:16:49,213 --> 00:16:50,313
I want him.

334
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:52,299
Now I want him even more.
I want him.

335
00:16:52,419 --> 00:16:54,570
What are going to do with him?
Are you gonna look for mines?

336
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,455
- Oh, walk the field...
- Stop, Jerry.

337
00:16:58,713 --> 00:17:00,047
I'm going to rescue him.

338
00:17:00,945 --> 00:17:02,198
How much?!

339
00:17:02,577 --> 00:17:04,829
Don't tell me you're changing
your mind about Napoleon,

340
00:17:04,949 --> 00:17:05,960
the scribbling pachyderm.

341
00:17:06,082 --> 00:17:07,915
If I can't have the Joe,
you can't have the elephant.

342
00:17:08,047 --> 00:17:10,078
I'm not giving this company
any of my money

343
00:17:10,198 --> 00:17:12,012
if I can't have the Joe...
Jerry...

344
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:13,956
If I can't have Jerry.

345
00:17:14,149 --> 00:17:16,877
I told you the dog food company
paid for him already.

346
00:17:16,997 --> 00:17:18,226
How much and I'll pay it back?

347
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:20,371
Is it... Is it the sale
that you don't want?

348
00:17:20,685 --> 00:17:22,309
We could always lease him.

349
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:25,473
Brownie, you had
a good idea just now...

350
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:27,133
A very good idea.

351
00:17:27,253 --> 00:17:29,249
Lease... Hmm, lease.

352
00:17:29,567 --> 00:17:31,585
Yes, that may work, actually.

353
00:17:32,036 --> 00:17:33,797
Son of a gun, you got me there.

354
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:36,699
All right.
One year, paid in advance.

355
00:17:37,414 --> 00:17:39,864
- Martha...
- Whatever. Jerry.

356
00:17:41,739 --> 00:17:42,931
Jerry,

357
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:44,868
you're coming home.

358
00:17:48,743 --> 00:17:51,738
Oh, boy.
What a good elephant.

359
00:17:52,017 --> 00:17:53,578
No more writing
on the floor, Nappy.

360
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,876
Remember what I told you?

361
00:17:54,996 --> 00:17:58,239
He likes me. You can let him
express himself if he likes me.

362
00:17:58,826 --> 00:18:01,440
It's just ink. It'll wash off.
Here.

363
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,713
So what?

364
00:18:07,886 --> 00:18:10,374
All gone. Sigret?

365
00:18:10,983 --> 00:18:13,256
Sigret later, Jerry.

366
00:18:13,812 --> 00:18:16,159
Oh, Jerry messy.
Jerry need clean up.

367
00:18:17,095 --> 00:18:18,781
I think you need to clean up, Jerry.

368
00:18:18,901 --> 00:18:20,719
Oh, no boom today.

369
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,466
Jerry walk.

370
00:18:22,776 --> 00:18:24,514
Jerry no boom.
Walk, no boom.

371
00:18:24,927 --> 00:18:26,520
Candy? Sigret?

372
00:18:27,184 --> 00:18:29,284
Oh, Jerry work good, boss.

373
00:18:29,404 --> 00:18:30,940
Jerry work good, boss.

374
00:18:31,233 --> 00:18:34,051
I think you're jealous of Jerry's
happiness, Brownie.

375
00:18:34,171 --> 00:18:35,825
He has no emotions, Martha.

376
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,861
The elephant has more emotions
than the Joe.

377
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:40,334
Don't you, boy?

378
00:18:40,556 --> 00:18:43,943
Don't you have more emotions
that that silly old Joe?

379
00:18:44,643 --> 00:18:46,671
Oh, Jerry sad.

380
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:48,736
No sigret.

381
00:18:49,149 --> 00:18:50,920
Oh, Jerry sad.

382
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,832
Oh, Jerry,
I don't want you to be sad.

383
00:18:55,761 --> 00:18:58,315
Brownie sad.
Brownie alone here.

384
00:18:58,821 --> 00:19:00,398
Missy never clean up Brownie.

385
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,469
Brownie didn't serve
his company... country.

386
00:19:03,844 --> 00:19:05,170
Whatever, company, country...

387
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:07,996
You didn't serve either one
walking in the minefields.

388
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,290
Come with me, Jerry.

389
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,107
It's bedtime.

390
00:19:28,923 --> 00:19:30,576
He's sitting on my pillow,
Martha.

391
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:33,244
He's just a Joe, Brownie.

392
00:19:33,591 --> 00:19:35,642
- Yeah?
- He's just a Joe.

393
00:19:38,892 --> 00:19:42,067
Nappy likes his bed.
Oh, look, Martha. Martha.

394
00:19:46,459 --> 00:19:48,309
I put on half a pound this month.

395
00:19:49,026 --> 00:19:51,224
I'm gonna work out.
Come with me.

396
00:19:51,615 --> 00:19:54,099
Let's go down to the gym room,
and we'll throw on a movie

397
00:19:54,219 --> 00:19:56,700
and watch it for a couple
of miles on the treadmill, hmm?

398
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,484
You go. I'll stay here
and take care of Nappy.

399
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,187
Well, tell Nappy
I said good night.

400
00:20:12,361 --> 00:20:15,178
You don't care about
your weight, do you, Jerry?

401
00:20:15,736 --> 00:20:17,314
Jerry like candy.

402
00:20:20,056 --> 00:20:22,411
That is such a simple truth.

403
00:20:24,316 --> 00:20:25,800
I don't know
how to say a sentence

404
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,537
with just three simple words.

405
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:30,450
- Sigret?
- Or one word.

406
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,756
What's it like being Jerry?

407
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,579
Oh, it's silly to ask, isn't it?

408
00:20:35,701 --> 00:20:37,707
Might as well ask me
what it's like being Martha.

409
00:20:39,044 --> 00:20:40,903
Jerry, uh, walk?

410
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,095
Well, that's it, isn't it?

411
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:46,264
Jerry walk. Martha spend.

412
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,321
Jerry smoke. Martha diet.

413
00:20:49,556 --> 00:20:50,880
Martha make love to husband.

414
00:20:51,105 --> 00:20:53,186
Martha roll over and go to sleep.
Martha wake up.

415
00:20:53,306 --> 00:20:55,575
Martha work out.
Martha spend money.

416
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:56,796
Martha spend...

417
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,070
lots and lots of... money.

418
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:04,315
Do you even know what money is?

419
00:21:04,784 --> 00:21:07,620
Oh, candy. Uh, sigret?

420
00:21:08,795 --> 00:21:09,950
Of course.

421
00:21:11,049 --> 00:21:12,950
What else can it be
but what you buy with it?

422
00:21:13,677 --> 00:21:15,565
And if you don't spend it,
then it's nothing.

423
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:19,224
Oh, did I get this right, Jerry?

424
00:21:19,712 --> 00:21:22,797
If money is just candy
and cigarettes...

425
00:21:22,917 --> 00:21:24,289
- No, sigret.
- Sigret.

426
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:35,708
If money is just
what you trade it for

427
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:37,291
and you don't trade it,

428
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:39,064
then you don't have any money.

429
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,487
We live very simply...

430
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:43,156
like in the bible.

431
00:21:45,358 --> 00:21:47,721
So if I have all my billions,
but I don't spend them,

432
00:21:47,841 --> 00:21:50,326
then my billions
aren't really there.

433
00:21:52,016 --> 00:21:55,265
That's so simple and yet
so complicated at the same time.

434
00:21:58,031 --> 00:21:59,101
Jerry,

435
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:01,224
look at what you know.

436
00:22:02,747 --> 00:22:05,526
What if you're the last thing
I ever buy...

437
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:10,531
Except for clothing
and shoes and travel?

438
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:16,668
I'll be happy.

439
00:22:18,826 --> 00:22:19,987
Thank you.

440
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:24,185
Jerry want sleep now.

441
00:22:25,756 --> 00:22:27,418
Jerry get sleep now.

442
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:42,919
Martha!

443
00:22:45,284 --> 00:22:46,645
He was lonely.

444
00:22:46,786 --> 00:22:47,791
Candy?

445
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:49,998
Out now!

446
00:22:54,968 --> 00:22:56,142
Walk the field.

447
00:22:56,396 --> 00:22:58,020
Oh, walk the field.

448
00:23:01,979 --> 00:23:03,105
He's going back.

449
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,946
This isn't going to work.

450
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,563
If I had a minefield that
he could sweep, then I...

451
00:23:07,735 --> 00:23:09,909
I could keep him busy,
but I don't have a minefield.

452
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:11,055
He's ours.

453
00:23:11,175 --> 00:23:13,819
We got a lease on him...
no option to buy,

454
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:15,967
and I'm taking him back.

455
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,102
If you do, I'll leave you.

456
00:23:20,556 --> 00:23:22,997
You'd leave me
for that weapon detector?

457
00:23:23,495 --> 00:23:25,515
You'd... You'd leave me
for that thing?!

458
00:23:25,698 --> 00:23:28,242
Not "Thing."
Jerry is a him.

459
00:23:30,292 --> 00:23:31,467
If you want to keep him,

460
00:23:31,587 --> 00:23:33,265
you'll have to sue
Controlled Genetics.

461
00:23:33,385 --> 00:23:35,512
Do you know how much
that's gonna cost you, Martha?

462
00:23:36,756 --> 00:23:37,826
Think hard...

463
00:23:39,206 --> 00:23:40,671
It or me?

464
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:43,844
Suing Controlled Genetics
will cost me a lot less

465
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,618
than making good
on the prenup, darling.

466
00:23:45,761 --> 00:23:47,001
I'll take this to court.

467
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:48,954
I'll keep him, and I'll keep you.

468
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:54,535
Now look what you've done.
You woke up the elephant.

469
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,337
No boom.

470
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,481
The lease agreement is very clear,
Mrs. Van Vogel.

471
00:24:04,706 --> 00:24:06,368
There is no lease option to buy.

472
00:24:06,527 --> 00:24:08,255
So I haven't saved his life.

473
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:10,095
It wasn't yours to save.

474
00:24:10,983 --> 00:24:12,720
And after all he did
for his country...

475
00:24:12,861 --> 00:24:14,560
I mean, company. Company...

476
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,434
Except for the part
about not actually dying,

477
00:24:17,554 --> 00:24:19,298
but he might have,
and he shouldn't.

478
00:24:19,439 --> 00:24:20,594
Poor Jerry.

479
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:25,040
So I came to you because I want
to sue them to change the lease.

480
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,844
I want to sue for ownership,
and then I want to set him free

481
00:24:27,981 --> 00:24:29,934
And I want to stop
all this killings...

482
00:24:30,161 --> 00:24:31,307
If you were able to prove

483
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:34,105
that their methods of disposing
of these things were inhumane,

484
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,012
or if they were negligent

485
00:24:36,132 --> 00:24:38,102
of their physical welfare
before destroying them

486
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:41,032
- or if the destruction was wanton...
- But it is.

487
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:43,032
Not in a legal sense.

488
00:24:43,271 --> 00:24:46,736
You cannot compel a person
to maintain property at a loss.

489
00:24:48,382 --> 00:24:49,668
What do you think, Mr. McCoy,

490
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:52,128
could we approach
this through the S.P.C.A.?

491
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:55,121
No. No, the S.P.C.A.
angle's no good.

492
00:24:55,267 --> 00:24:56,915
Cargrew's lawyers
will be ready to prove

493
00:24:57,084 --> 00:24:59,109
that the Joes actually
enjoy being killed off.

494
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:04,270
What are you thinking?

495
00:25:06,195 --> 00:25:07,528
Does Jerry like music?

496
00:25:07,894 --> 00:25:09,228
Like it? He loves it.

497
00:25:09,462 --> 00:25:10,918
He's been learning to sing.

498
00:25:11,587 --> 00:25:13,437
I'd like to hear him sing.

499
00:25:13,878 --> 00:25:14,883
Well...

500
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:17,893
Jerry, take out
your ear thingies.

501
00:25:19,652 --> 00:25:20,660
Good boy.

502
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,875
Jerry, sing us a song...
something you like.

503
00:25:27,436 --> 00:25:29,774
<i>Oh, jinger bez,</i>

504
00:25:29,925 --> 00:25:33,164
<i>Jinger bez,

<i>Sr...</i>

508
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:46,930
Is that your phone number?

509
00:25:47,409 --> 00:25:48,574
No.

510
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:50,525
That's what it will cost you
to hire me

511
00:25:50,645 --> 00:25:54,290
to take this case to court
and win it.

512
00:25:58,380 --> 00:25:59,982
<i>One of the richest women
in the world</i>

513
00:26:00,102 --> 00:26:01,663

514
00:26:01,783 --> 00:26:04,023
<i>fighting to save
a Joe named Jerry.</i>

515
00:26:04,811 --> 00:26:07,577
<i>I guess I'd taken for granted
all of the Joes in the world</i>

516
00:26:07,697 --> 00:26:09,402
<i>until I met Jerry.</i>

517
00:26:10,111 --> 00:26:12,022
<i>Are you saying that
this Joe is a human?</i>

518
00:26:12,276 --> 00:26:15,100
<i>I'm saying that Jerry
and all the other Joes</i>

519
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,681
<i>shouldn't be turned into dog food
when they're out of work.</i>

520
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:20,647
<i>Well, I don't work,
and I would hate to be kibbled.</i>

521
00:26:22,538 --> 00:26:25,336
<i>The club board has voted to
terminate Martha's membership.</i>

522
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,246
<i>We have Joes working here,
and the thought of Martha</i>

523
00:26:28,366 --> 00:26:30,618
<i>coming into the club
with a Joe as a guest was,</i>

524
00:26:30,738 --> 00:26:32,715
<i>well, frankly disgusting.</i>

525
00:26:33,678 --> 00:26:36,547
<i>A Joe serving food
to another Joe, uh...</i>

526
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:39,904
<i>Think about it...
It... It's insane.</i>

527
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,458
<i>Well, I've said it.</i>

528
00:26:42,834 --> 00:26:43,876
<i>It's insane.</i>

529
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:58,170
All rise for the honorable
judge Alexa Pomfrey,

530
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:00,471
judge Leo Tolchinsky

531
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:02,953
and judge Wendy Narita.

532
00:27:06,105 --> 00:27:07,336
You may be seated.

533
00:27:10,469 --> 00:27:13,672
As many as 12 billion people
are watching this trial.

534
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:16,784
This tribunal is gonna be
very disappointed if the outside

535
00:27:17,047 --> 00:27:19,573
media circus affects
the deliberations in here.

536
00:27:20,004 --> 00:27:23,821
Each of us has at least 70 years
experience as a judge,

537
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:27,619
and I think that we've developed
a reputation for fairness

538
00:27:28,145 --> 00:27:29,610
and good manners.

539
00:27:29,997 --> 00:27:31,452
In the matter of Jerry...

540
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:32,636
No last name,

541
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:34,911
described as a legal,
permanent resident...

542
00:27:35,031 --> 00:27:37,511
against the corporate person,
Controlled Genetics,

543
00:27:37,631 --> 00:27:39,640
forbidding it to do him
any physical harm,

544
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,612
and in particular, forbidding
the company from killing him.

545
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:45,871
Counsel for the plaintiff,
are you ready to begin?

546
00:27:52,658 --> 00:27:55,315
A corporation is a legal fiction.

547
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:57,274
It can't vote.

548
00:27:57,631 --> 00:27:59,668
It can't read a book.

549
00:27:59,814 --> 00:28:01,861
It can't walk the dog,

550
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:03,398
but you are gonna hear this...

551
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:06,688
imaginary soulless entity argue

552
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:08,890
that a flesh and blood creature,

553
00:28:09,388 --> 00:28:13,313
a being of, uh, hopes
and longings and passions...

554
00:28:13,471 --> 00:28:17,368
That fictional entity is gonna
argue that a friend of mine

555
00:28:18,303 --> 00:28:20,750
has no legal existence,
and that's what we're talking...

556
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,144
That's who we're talking about...

557
00:28:24,482 --> 00:28:25,655
Right over there.

558
00:28:33,497 --> 00:28:34,717
My friend Jerry.

559
00:28:36,188 --> 00:28:37,286
Sigret?

560
00:28:38,194 --> 00:28:39,752
Later, Jerry, later.

561
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,459
Don't tell me to tell you
that Jerry doesn't exist,

562
00:28:44,579 --> 00:28:47,017
because, of course,
I know the Joe exists.

563
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:49,036
I see him sitting over there.

564
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,424
But is he alive?

565
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:53,100
I don't deny that
he has a sort of life but...

566
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:54,884
he's not really a person.

567
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:57,984
He's the product
of a series of patents.

568
00:28:58,334 --> 00:29:00,916
Everyone thought the future
was going to be mechanical...

569
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:03,395
Robots, robots.

570
00:29:04,567 --> 00:29:08,200
But the world will not
be served by toasters.

571
00:29:08,932 --> 00:29:11,242
Now what... what is a Joe?

572
00:29:11,946 --> 00:29:15,664
A Joe is a few strands
of human D.N.A.

573
00:29:15,927 --> 00:29:18,846
along with some other stuff
which is proprietary,

574
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:22,864
and then it's all manipulated
to serve a specific sign.

575
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:25,703
I-I could give you an example.

576
00:29:26,276 --> 00:29:28,173
There is camera Joe.

577
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:32,154
Over here... minefield Joe.

578
00:29:36,538 --> 00:29:37,777
Case closed, your honor.

579
00:29:39,313 --> 00:29:40,730
We'd like to show a video.

580
00:29:42,158 --> 00:29:43,547
I like videos.

581
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:45,342
Great. Let's watch.

582
00:29:57,781 --> 00:30:01,246
This was taken six months ago.
Jerry is the one in the center.

583
00:30:01,452 --> 00:30:02,682
<i>Company halt.</i>

584
00:30:02,985 --> 00:30:04,393
<i>Sweep the mines, Joes.</i>

585
00:30:04,688 --> 00:30:06,294
Walk, no boom.

586
00:30:06,557 --> 00:30:09,561
Yeah, well, maybe "walk, no boom"
for you, Joe, but...

587
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:10,716
Jerry.

588
00:30:10,866 --> 00:30:11,917
Just watch.

589
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:49,041
<i>Sigret.</i>

590
00:30:50,876 --> 00:30:51,909
<i>Sankoo.</i>

591
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:54,094
Thank you.

592
00:30:56,057 --> 00:30:57,335
What did you just see?

593
00:30:58,089 --> 00:30:59,943
Well, I think
it's obvious that he...

594
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:01,908
doesn't care
whether he lives or dies,

595
00:31:02,028 --> 00:31:03,931
and that's the way
I designed him.

596
00:31:04,226 --> 00:31:05,832
He's not afraid of death.

597
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:09,428
Then it's into the bus,
and after that it's...

598
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:12,254
Know what I mean?
No problem-o.

599
00:31:12,676 --> 00:31:13,929
He's not a man.

600
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:16,517
Your honor,
I move to dismiss this case.

601
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:18,481
I would do the same thing
if I were you.

602
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:20,827
Mr. McCoy, can well call it a day?

603
00:31:21,766 --> 00:31:23,174
Call it a day, your honor?

604
00:31:23,968 --> 00:31:24,991
A day?

605
00:31:25,292 --> 00:31:26,316
You saw the video?

606
00:31:26,436 --> 00:31:28,179
I did your honor.
I saw the video,

607
00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:29,777
and... and the video...

608
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:34,512
your honor,
the video proves that Jerry,

609
00:31:35,007 --> 00:31:37,318
your honor, Jerry is a man.

610
00:31:41,072 --> 00:31:42,311
I knew it.

611
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:48,257
I just want to ask you a couple
or three questions. You with me?

612
00:31:48,623 --> 00:31:51,425
- Yes.
- Why was Jerry set for destruction?

613
00:31:51,913 --> 00:31:53,078
The truth.

614
00:31:55,992 --> 00:31:57,804
There was no more money in him.

615
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:02,258
I mean, it's... it's like a...
a different form of layoff.

616
00:32:02,971 --> 00:32:04,855
In the old days
when a car company

617
00:32:04,975 --> 00:32:07,850
stopped making money on a model,
they'd fire the workers

618
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:09,156
and keep the pensions.

619
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:10,628
Now we...

620
00:32:11,577 --> 00:32:12,947
we liquidate them.

621
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:15,379
A lot less misery, if you ask me.

622
00:32:16,801 --> 00:32:19,497
Thank you, Mr. Cargrew,
for your honesty.

623
00:32:19,617 --> 00:32:20,652
It's a pleasure.

624
00:32:20,774 --> 00:32:21,873
Next witness.

625
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,197
You may step down.

626
00:32:23,879 --> 00:32:25,795
Mr. McCoy,
who do you want to call?

627
00:32:30,762 --> 00:32:32,312
- Jerry.
- Objection, your honor.

628
00:32:32,432 --> 00:32:34,245
This anthropoid
cannot be examined.

629
00:32:34,365 --> 00:32:36,634
He is a mere part
and chattel of the respondent.

630
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,381
That's what we're trying
to determine.

631
00:32:38,691 --> 00:32:40,034
Objection overruled.

632
00:32:40,936 --> 00:32:43,125
Okay, Jerry.
They want you to talk, now.

633
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:45,642
- You know what to do.
- And then I get candy?

634
00:32:46,093 --> 00:32:47,980
Then you get dignity.

635
00:32:48,327 --> 00:32:50,787
No dignity, boss. Candy.

636
00:32:52,688 --> 00:32:54,810
Candy now, dignity after.

637
00:32:55,066 --> 00:32:56,554
Your honor, objection.

638
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,578
The Joe can't take the witness stand
Because he can't swear to an oath.

639
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,711
- He doesn't have the understanding.
- What do you say to that, Mr. McCoy?

640
00:33:02,831 --> 00:33:05,218
I say let's put him on the stand
and find out.

641
00:33:05,719 --> 00:33:07,034
Proceed with the oath.

642
00:33:12,731 --> 00:33:13,820
Raise your right hand.

643
00:33:18,307 --> 00:33:19,405
Hello.

644
00:33:19,912 --> 00:33:21,926
Do you solemnly swear
to tell the truth,

645
00:33:22,133 --> 00:33:24,204
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth,

646
00:33:24,324 --> 00:33:26,419
so help you god...
Goddess,

647
00:33:26,735 --> 00:33:30,617
buddha, Allah,
Great Spirit, Higher Power, Gaia,

648
00:33:30,948 --> 00:33:33,534
and the Great Turtle
that supports the universe?

649
00:33:34,337 --> 00:33:35,389
Boss?

650
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:37,241
Okay, boss.

651
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,103
Jerry, my friend,

652
00:33:49,032 --> 00:33:50,450
You're a good worker, huh?

653
00:33:54,438 --> 00:33:56,917
Oh, Jerry a... good worker.

654
00:33:57,914 --> 00:34:01,116
Jerry dig up weed.
Jerry no dig up vegetabar.

655
00:34:01,443 --> 00:34:04,188
Yeah, yeah, but Jerry good singer,
too, aren't you, Jerry?

656
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,504
Your honor, objection.
This line of questioning is irrelevant.

657
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:09,807
Objection overruled.
Continue.

658
00:34:09,927 --> 00:34:12,307
Jerry, would you sing us
your favorite song?

659
00:34:16,361 --> 00:34:20,347
<i>Oh, jinger bez, jinger bez,</i>

660
00:34:20,595 --> 00:34:22,539
<i>Jinger awrah day,</i>

661
00:34:22,858 --> 00:34:26,751
<i>Oh, wot fun tiz to ride
a 1-hoss open</i>

662
00:34:26,871 --> 00:34:29,652
- <i>sray...</i>
- No, th-thank you, Jerry.

663
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,912
I want to establish
for the court

664
00:34:32,032 --> 00:34:34,796
that Jerry likes Christmas music.

665
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:37,350
Now I have another question
for you, Jerry.

666
00:34:37,905 --> 00:34:39,370
How many fingers am I holding up?

667
00:34:39,874 --> 00:34:43,987
Oh, one, two, sree, four, five.

668
00:34:44,283 --> 00:34:45,344
Six fingers, Jerry.

669
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:47,165
Oh, five, boss.

670
00:34:47,312 --> 00:34:49,678
Six fingers, Jerry.
I'll give you a cigarette.

671
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,631
Six...

672
00:34:58,049 --> 00:34:59,157
for a cigarette.

673
00:35:00,696 --> 00:35:02,320
How many fingers for a sigret?

674
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:04,623
Okay, just stop right there, Jerry.

675
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:08,306
Your honor, could we replay
the video of Jerry in the Minefield?

676
00:35:08,426 --> 00:35:10,184
- Why?
- Why not?

677
00:35:10,479 --> 00:35:11,653
Run the video.

678
00:35:14,025 --> 00:35:16,734
Okay, uh, speed it up
to about halfway through.

679
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:21,272
Good. Stop right there.

680
00:35:21,601 --> 00:35:23,042
Let's go back
and play that again,

681
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:26,212
only closer on Jerry's
last contact with the other Joe.

682
00:35:39,761 --> 00:35:42,080
Okay, freeze it... Now.

683
00:35:50,468 --> 00:35:51,594
Please, stop.

684
00:35:52,414 --> 00:35:54,254
Now, Jerry,

685
00:35:55,356 --> 00:35:57,882
when you went
behind the other Joe,

686
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,887
did you give him a little push

687
00:36:00,007 --> 00:36:02,758
so that he would move
into what had been your row?

688
00:36:04,722 --> 00:36:07,191
Joe go boom, Jerry...
Jerry get candy.

689
00:36:07,618 --> 00:36:10,483
Yes. Joe go boom,
Jerry get candy.

690
00:36:10,603 --> 00:36:12,623
Jerry,
why did you move behind him?

691
00:36:14,848 --> 00:36:16,181
Jerry, uh...

692
00:36:17,854 --> 00:36:19,122
Jerry see mine.

693
00:36:19,446 --> 00:36:21,709
Jerry see mine, and Jerry...

694
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:24,614
switch places, and Joe go boom

695
00:36:24,868 --> 00:36:26,116
and Jerry get candy.

696
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,851
Jerry see land mine,

697
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:35,056
and Jerry switched places,

698
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:39,284
and Joe go boom
and Jerry get candy.

699
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:46,520
Let's review the facts, my friends.

700
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,411
Let's go over
what we've just seen.

701
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:50,153
One...

702
00:36:50,969 --> 00:36:53,448
Jerry likes Christmas carols.

703
00:36:54,224 --> 00:36:55,679
Does that make him a man?

704
00:36:57,045 --> 00:36:59,205
I think it does,
but you want more evidence.

705
00:36:59,758 --> 00:37:02,378
Two... He wants a cigarette,

706
00:37:02,498 --> 00:37:05,032
and he is willing to lie to get one.
He is willing to...

707
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,632
take a bribe to subvert
what he knows to be true...

708
00:37:09,522 --> 00:37:12,282
Does lying make him human?

709
00:37:14,227 --> 00:37:15,466
I think it does.

710
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:17,744
But you want more evidence?

711
00:37:18,935 --> 00:37:21,456
What about what we just saw
on the video? Three...

712
00:37:22,169 --> 00:37:25,879
Jerry is willing to sacrifice
another Joe to save his own life.

713
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:28,332
What's more, he told us
about it on the stand.

714
00:37:28,452 --> 00:37:31,364
He admitted to something that most
of us would be ashamed to admit to.

715
00:37:32,065 --> 00:37:33,353
Tell me, please tell me,

716
00:37:33,473 --> 00:37:35,460
what could possibly
be more human

717
00:37:36,111 --> 00:37:37,604
than self-preservation

718
00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:43,235
and a callous disregard of others?

719
00:37:43,666 --> 00:37:47,399
You can program a robot
to sing a few songs,

720
00:37:47,881 --> 00:37:49,273
but does a robot cheat?

721
00:37:50,073 --> 00:37:51,095
No.

722
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:53,989
Does a potato cheat? No.

723
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:57,873
Jerry is capable of cheating.

724
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:08,749
Can... Can I let you in
on a little secret?

725
00:38:09,227 --> 00:38:11,730
And... and please,
don't hold this against me.

726
00:38:13,566 --> 00:38:14,862
I believe in God.

727
00:38:16,188 --> 00:38:18,446
And if God...

728
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:20,389
gave life to man,

729
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,659
and man gave life to Jerry,
then...

730
00:38:25,532 --> 00:38:27,081
there's a... a little...

731
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:31,231
a little spark
of the divine in Jerry,

732
00:38:31,749 --> 00:38:35,261
just the same as there's a little spark
of the divine in you, your honors,

733
00:38:36,584 --> 00:38:39,192
and you, Mr. Cargrew,
and even you, Mr. Pyramus.

734
00:38:40,216 --> 00:38:44,000
I am not gonna stand by and turn
that little spark of the divine

735
00:38:44,172 --> 00:38:46,469
into... into small
breed puppy food

736
00:38:46,589 --> 00:38:48,398
and feed it to a dog. No.

737
00:38:48,916 --> 00:38:51,113
Call me old-fashioned,
but that's not me.

738
00:38:57,951 --> 00:39:00,130
That little spark of the divine.

739
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:12,864
All those little sparks
of the divine...

740
00:39:13,606 --> 00:39:14,723
Wait a minute!

741
00:39:15,857 --> 00:39:18,606
I hold the patent on that...

742
00:39:19,069 --> 00:39:21,473
little spark of the divine!

743
00:39:29,922 --> 00:39:32,337
<i>Mrs. Van Vogel, now that
we can't kill the workers</i>

744
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:35,238
<i>when they're no longer useful,
we have to feed them and house them.</i>

745
00:39:35,398 --> 00:39:36,699
<i>Prices are gonna rise.</i>

746
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:38,680
<i>Stocks are already falling
on the news.</i>

747
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,494
<i>Controlled Genetics
just opened the doors</i>

748
00:39:40,614 --> 00:39:42,752
<i>and let all their retired
workers out on the street.</i>

749
00:39:42,987 --> 00:39:44,879
<i>Are you gonna take care
of all of them?</i>

750
00:39:45,410 --> 00:39:46,565
<i>No,</i>

751
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:48,471
<i>just one.</i>

752
00:39:52,214 --> 00:39:55,032
I have to say, this is gonna take me
some time to get used to.

753
00:39:55,152 --> 00:39:57,247
It's not how I was raised,

754
00:39:58,082 --> 00:40:00,375
but daddy always said,

755
00:40:00,824 --> 00:40:04,120
"Brownie, morality
is like the stock market."

756
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:07,053
Well,
I don't understand the market,

757
00:40:07,684 --> 00:40:09,365
and I don't understand morality,

758
00:40:10,745 --> 00:40:12,398
but I understand you,

759
00:40:13,224 --> 00:40:15,463
and you understand me,

760
00:40:15,833 --> 00:40:17,354
and meeting you has been

761
00:40:17,474 --> 00:40:19,560
the high point of my life.

762
00:40:25,316 --> 00:40:27,589
Well, I like you, too, Napoleon.

763
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:29,146
I do.

764
00:40:29,726 --> 00:40:31,003
I like you a lot.

765
00:40:31,987 --> 00:40:33,715
Why don't we go
to the park tomorrow?

766
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:35,349
No, no, not the park.

767
00:40:35,513 --> 00:40:37,024
I'll take you to the club.

768
00:40:37,522 --> 00:40:39,700
Oh, you'll like the club.
I do.

769
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:41,974
<i>You promised you'd quit.</i>

770
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:44,422
Sigret.

771
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:46,628
This is your last one, baby.

772
00:40:47,248 --> 00:40:49,229
I want you to live forever.

773
00:40:54,689 --> 00:40:55,947
Sure, baby.

774
00:40:56,915 --> 00:40:58,079
Sigret.

775
00:41:00,986 --> 00:41:02,667
<i>What makes us human</i>

776
00:41:02,864 --> 00:41:04,671
<i>may one day be defined</i>

777
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,093
<i>not by the gifts we possess,</i>

778
00:41:07,281 --> 00:41:09,309
<i>but by the virtues we lack.</i>
