00:00:14,143 --> 00:00:17,560
Next bus will be in twenty minutes. It's local and it's twenty-five.

2
00:00:19,383 --> 00:00:20,401
I love that song!

3
00:00:21,423 --> 00:00:25,232
Hey, what happens when you get the zero bottles of beer on the wall?

4
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:44,598
Excuse me.

5
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:52,500
- Twin...kies. They come two in a pack.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:52,703 --> 00:00:57,378
Would you sell this for, twenty dollars?

7
00:00:58,279 --> 00:00:58,979
Thank you.

8
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:11,857
Um, this is fascinating.

9
00:01:12,863 --> 00:01:16,300
Cake with frosting injected inside.

10
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:19,052
Technically, it is filling.

11
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:22,119
Whatever is, it's tasty.

12
00:01:24,263 --> 00:01:25,218
I am Jarod.

13
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,219
- Dan Healy.
- Hi, Dan.

14
00:01:28,783 --> 00:01:29,898
Is that your family?

15
00:01:30,263 --> 00:01:33,155
My wife, Susan. My son, Todd.

16
00:01:34,623 --> 00:01:37,193
Just made all conference thrid straight year.

17
00:01:37,863 --> 00:01:39,276
You must be very proud.

18
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:40,813
In my whole life.

19
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:45,416
How about you? Any family photos?

20
00:01:46,623 --> 00:01:47,878
Oh, yes.

21
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,979
This is my mother.

22
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:59,418
This is my brother. And this, belong to my father.

23
00:02:00,263 --> 00:02:02,299
Distinguish flying cross.

24
00:02:03,163 --> 00:02:06,617
He gave it to my brother, and my brother passed it on to me.

25
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:09,499
Flying this for a father!

26
00:02:10,823 --> 00:02:11,876
Are you close?

27
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:16,356
I was separated from my family when I was a boy.

28
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:17,878
I am searching for them.

29
00:02:19,343 --> 00:02:20,773
I hope you find them, Jarod.

30
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:21,774
Thank you.

31
00:02:24,463 --> 00:02:26,531
That's the express, it doesn't stop here.

32
00:02:27,483 --> 00:02:28,536
Just remember,

33
00:02:30,223 --> 00:02:32,179
there is nothing more important than family.

34
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,980
No!

35
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:40,681
No.

36
00:02:45,183 --> 00:02:47,194
Stay with me, stay with me!

37
00:02:47,383 --> 00:02:49,135
Somebody call an ambulance!

38
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:54,558
I let them down, Jarod, I let them all down.

39
00:02:57,059 --> 00:03:01,059
No, no, no!

40
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:15,860
There are pretends among us. Genuises with the ability to become anyone they want to be.
In 1963, a corporation known as the Centre isolated a young Pretender named Jarod, and exploited his genius for their research.

41
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,161
Then one day, the pretender ran away...

42
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:26,162
THE PRETENDER

00:03:50,462 --> 00:03:56,762
Jesus, No, No, Danny, please, Danny...

46
00:04:04,183 --> 00:04:04,911
How is he?

47
00:04:05,603 --> 00:04:07,201
He is alive,thanks to you.

48
00:04:07,302 --> 00:04:08,402
You should have been a paramedic.

49
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:11,153
He is still unconscious, but he is stable.

50
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:12,154
His family.

51
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:14,837
They seem like good people.

52
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:16,201
Why the hell the guy did this?

53
00:04:16,802 --> 00:04:18,002
I don't know.

54
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:51,972
Is suicide the answer?

55
00:04:52,123 --> 00:04:55,455
I set myself on fire because I am convinced it'll send a message, Sydney.

56
00:04:55,556 --> 00:04:56,756
It'll stop the war.

57
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,492
We understand that.

58
00:04:59,503 --> 00:05:00,763
But what are you feeling?

59
00:05:01,064 --> 00:05:03,264
Stay with the simulation, Jarod.

60
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:05,817
But he had people who loved him.

61
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:08,752
How can he do that to them?

62
00:05:09,023 --> 00:05:11,600
That's not significant to the simulation.

63
00:05:11,943 --> 00:05:13,695
Family is important to anyone, Sydney.

64
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,938
What he is doing won't stop the war.

65
00:05:17,263 --> 00:05:18,881
It'll just destroy the family.

66
00:05:19,263 --> 00:05:20,974
Why would someone want to do this?

67
00:05:22,243 --> 00:05:25,535
Jarod, suicide is not just an action.

68
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:27,620
It's a cry for help.

69
00:05:31,343 --> 00:05:32,462
I hope that I can.

70
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:50,880
Questions remained about the deadly spill inside ECS(Environmental Containment Systems),

71
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:54,081
a private firm specialized in hazardous materials clean up.

72
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,555
We obtained exclusive fire department for it,

73
00:05:56,623 --> 00:06:01,954
taking immediately after a container of deadly MZT foam ruptured during routine storage.

74
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:07,855
Three ECS workers were killed when the concentrated pesticide burned to their lung and paralyzed their nerve system.

75
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:09,602
ECS spokeperson Curt Wilkes.

76
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:13,838
ECS is engaged in a full and thorough investigation of this tragedy.

77
00:06:13,983 --> 00:06:16,074
Our hearts go out to the family of those employees' ....

78
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:18,696
We called up the ECS engineer Dan Healy.

79
00:06:19,743 --> 00:06:21,754
Not now. They were my friends.

80
00:06:23,423 --> 00:06:26,301
- They were my friends.
- Yes, but are they dead because of you?

81
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,994
I tested the seals.

82
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:30,799
They were my friends. I let them down.

83
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,400
''ECS Accident Kills Three''

84
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:44,601
''Larry Meyers''

85
00:06:54,103 --> 00:06:55,616
Dear Susan and Todd,

86
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,814
I have failed you as a husband and a father,

87
00:06:58,103 --> 00:07:00,612
just as I failed my friends and co-workers.

88
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:03,659
I am sorry for the nightmare I made in your lives,

89
00:07:03,743 --> 00:07:04,895
You deserve better.

90
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:07,894
Love, Dan.

91
00:07:17,223 --> 00:07:18,776
Welcome to ECS, Jarod.

92
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:23,173
I read my orientation pack that the company ... seventy-five million dollar profit last year.

93
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:29,521
Yeah, and that Taiwan is a tanker we just pump three Belgian crew. Their shipping line is one of our biggest clients.

94
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:31,476
This is very interesting.

95
00:07:32,823 --> 00:07:34,991
You process the waste with this system.

96
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,574
What comes out is highly concentrated.

97
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:39,296
And highly deadly.

98
00:07:39,943 --> 00:07:41,135
We secure the waste,

99
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:45,536
we seal them in these level A containers and then we ship them off to some salt mine in Nevada,

100
00:07:45,743 --> 00:07:47,918
where they won't give anybody any trouble for a while.

101
00:07:48,203 --> 00:07:50,298
High grade polyethylene container.

102
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,939
Does it last about twenty thousand years?

103
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:55,412
Yeah, Dick Clark will be ... open it.

104
00:07:55,703 --> 00:07:58,661
Funny, Strickland. Do you have any recommendations how we seal this ...?

105
00:07:59,143 --> 00:08:01,259
It is highly combustible and highly toxic.

106
00:08:02,063 --> 00:08:08,841
Since it's the level A container, I would suggest the double polymer neoprene and graphite seal.

107
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:11,741
That's right box, wrong ribbon.

108
00:08:12,023 --> 00:08:16,183
We're going back to black end because a part of the seal with red one was Dan Healy's design.

109
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:17,472
It's no longer for use.

110
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,514
Because of the MZT accident.

111
00:08:21,215 --> 00:08:21,915
Yeah.

112
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,272
Wear this.

113
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:27,555
As remembered.

114
00:08:28,543 --> 00:08:29,498
And remindering.

115
00:08:37,223 --> 00:08:38,622
Good morning, Miss Parker.

116
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:40,835
- Broots. - Sydney.
- You are looking¡­

117
00:08:41,543 --> 00:08:42,473
refreshed.

118
00:08:42,703 --> 00:08:45,058
New underpants will do that to you.

119
00:08:47,823 --> 00:08:49,372
Sydney, you made it funny.

120
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,917
Startling, I'm afraid.

121
00:08:51,118 --> 00:08:53,318
Last night I went on a date.

122
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:54,319
You had a date!

123
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,320
That's when two people actually meet instead of typing to each other on the computer keyboard.

124
00:08:58,783 --> 00:09:04,213
So if it was a date, how can you be sure that those are your underpants?

125
00:09:04,703 --> 00:09:08,971
Bernice and I went to this amusing little place, the Chocolate.

126
00:09:10,983 --> 00:09:13,777
You, you went a comedy club?

127
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:17,418
New experiences keep my psychiatric skills ...

128
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:20,112
- Not to mention that ...
- Exactly!

129
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,716
How many psychiatrists does it take to change one light-bulb?

130
00:09:25,103 --> 00:09:26,775
Oh, Wait... Oh...

131
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:36,020
Go ahead and tell us, ah, wait...

132
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:39,296
Wait, don't tell us.

133
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:46,936
Sydney, you are supposed to set the punch line...now.

134
00:09:47,137 --> 00:09:47,837
Sydney?

135
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:27,212
I have the transfer report for you, Gibbs.

136
00:10:30,863 --> 00:10:33,293
Forty-seven containers, almost a record.

137
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,438
Check this out.

138
00:10:38,023 --> 00:10:39,781
Um, You are a funny guy,Strickland.

139
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,178
Got you!

140
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:44,396
Have a little respect, will you?

141
00:10:47,483 --> 00:10:49,321
People died here a few weeks ago.

142
00:10:49,503 --> 00:10:52,873
Easy, Hunsacker. They were my friends too.

143
00:10:53,063 --> 00:10:56,439
Larry taught me that gig. He would thought that it was fine.

144
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,932
You eat that stuff?

145
00:11:07,823 --> 00:11:08,976
They are very good.

146
00:11:09,623 --> 00:11:10,602
Food of the Gods.

147
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,732
Dupont, right?

148
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,978
Yes, it is me.

149
00:11:14,263 --> 00:11:16,697
M.l.T., Exxon Valdez, Kowet.

150
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,740
It takes a long time to build that kind of resume.

151
00:11:19,223 --> 00:11:21,498
Actually, I typed it in four minutes.

152
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:23,051
That's funny!

153
00:11:23,983 --> 00:11:25,655
I'm Curt wilkes, media relations.

154
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:26,852
Nice to meet you.

155
00:11:27,343 --> 00:11:33,862
I just came down here to make clear no ECS's employee under any circumstances in the discuss of the MZT accident with the press.

156
00:11:34,743 --> 00:11:37,317
That'll make it a mean of Dan Healy's suicide attemp.

157
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:39,062
I wonder how that happened?

158
00:11:40,343 --> 00:11:42,941
Dan will have to say, when, if he regains his consciousness.

159
00:11:43,603 --> 00:11:46,297
Don't give the status ... Got it?

160
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:51,534
Oh he doesn't want Dan here already. He is a conductor.

161
00:12:06,103 --> 00:12:07,177
This is not good.

162
00:12:07,263 --> 00:12:11,542
I want you to sweap the Center for Sydney, every corner and every room on every sublevel.

163
00:12:11,823 --> 00:12:13,938
If he walked out, I want the sign-out sheet.

164
00:12:15,263 --> 00:12:17,579
And Sam,be luky.

165
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,480
Yes, Miss Parker.

166
00:12:22,223 --> 00:12:25,222
This is, this is really quat.

167
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:27,095
It's the Center, Broots.

168
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:29,241
People have the tendency to vanish.

169
00:12:29,943 --> 00:12:30,898
Like Mr. Lyle.

170
00:12:33,423 --> 00:12:36,081
- Have you ever seen he was like this before?
- once.

171
00:12:36,663 --> 00:12:38,521
Really? Over what?

172
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,738
It was personal.

173
00:12:42,183 --> 00:12:43,134
I hope he is okay.

174
00:12:43,935 --> 00:12:45,335
Do you think, do you think he is okay?

175
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,252
You tell me!

176
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:04,335
Help, help!

177
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,501
Larry! Help me!

178
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:11,219
You saw them dying, didn't you?

179
00:13:13,663 --> 00:13:15,118
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

180
00:13:16,863 --> 00:13:18,977
They were hasting the container up on the truck.

181
00:13:19,663 --> 00:13:20,940
First one just blew.

182
00:13:22,783 --> 00:13:24,458
No one was wearing the protective gear.

183
00:13:25,403 --> 00:13:26,953
For Hunsaker, said it'll deal out clear.

184
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:33,035
But the MZT took about twenty seconds to turn their insides into...

185
00:13:33,383 --> 00:13:36,578
I heard the alarm, and I arrived there with Strickland

186
00:13:37,703 --> 00:13:38,894
but the time we got in there

187
00:13:39,983 --> 00:13:41,160
they have already eaten through them.

188
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:43,560
Never have a chance.

189
00:13:46,503 --> 00:13:51,371
You know Dan was so careful. He worked on this for three years, tested and retested this.

190
00:13:55,303 --> 00:13:56,421
Not against the MZT.

191
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:58,834
It doesn't make any sense.

192
00:14:00,103 --> 00:14:01,821
Is that what you defend him from Wilkes?

193
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:04,334
Oh that snake only cares about corporate image.

194
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:06,756
You know Dan was debilitated.

195
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:09,653
He shouldn't go down for doing his job.

196
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:21,294
- He needs to see you.
- Mum, I can't.

197
00:14:21,383 --> 00:14:22,816
Todd, Todd, please.

198
00:14:23,103 --> 00:14:24,175
No, I am not going in there.

199
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,733
Excuse me.

200
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:34,053
I fixed it for him.

201
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:37,462
You were at the bus bench.

202
00:14:37,963 --> 00:14:39,263
You helped Dan.

203
00:14:39,943 --> 00:14:41,732
I didn't get the chance to thank you.

204
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:43,817
I am Jarod.

205
00:14:44,103 --> 00:14:46,378
- Susan.
- Hi, Susan.

206
00:14:48,023 --> 00:14:49,102
How is he doing?

207
00:14:52,883 --> 00:14:54,478
The doctors won't know for a while.

208
00:14:56,703 --> 00:14:58,214
He may never...

209
00:15:00,543 --> 00:15:01,492
Is that your son?

210
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:03,542
Todd, right?

211
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:05,343
Yeah, Todd.

212
00:15:05,623 --> 00:15:06,702
Dan talked about him.

213
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:11,892
He doesn't want to see his father.

214
00:15:15,783 --> 00:15:18,338
I don't know why I'm bothering you with our problems.

215
00:15:18,903 --> 00:15:21,815
Sometime it's nice to talk to someone who is not a reporter.

216
00:15:24,203 --> 00:15:28,958
Everyday these vultures' asking did his father kill those people.

217
00:15:32,943 --> 00:15:34,779
I think he started to believe it.

218
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,480
It is a very bad idea.

219
00:15:48,063 --> 00:15:50,723
Mr. Raines finds out we get Angelo to help, he is going to ask questions.

220
00:15:50,903 --> 00:15:52,842
Uncle Fester will never know the truth's missing.

221
00:15:54,383 --> 00:15:56,722
How long do you think it's going to take to feel what Sydney was feeling?

222
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,798
That answered your question?

223
00:16:19,743 --> 00:16:21,911
Jarod drew this. Who is he?

224
00:16:34,143 --> 00:16:36,501
Le Morte. Who is Le Morte?

225
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:39,598
The one who brings death.

226
00:16:40,523 --> 00:16:47,456
This is the ECS twenty-four pulling out now in the accident site eazing a tanker pouring indicator telling me it got a full load of triptochloronol.

227
00:16:47,943 --> 00:16:50,821
- Jes, look at all the fumes! 
- It got some of magicore leak ...

228
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:53,122
... to attempt onsite depressurization.

229
00:16:53,183 --> 00:16:54,232
Anyone call the paramedic?

230
00:16:54,623 --> 00:16:57,258
... a tank in the case of three thousand and rising fast.

231
00:16:57,903 --> 00:17:00,371
This suckers is going to blow if we don't pump fast.

232
00:17:00,663 --> 00:17:01,598
Update me.

233
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:03,655
It's already up to four thousand.

234
00:17:04,383 --> 00:17:06,174
Come on, Hunsaker, lights on.

235
00:17:07,463 --> 00:17:08,333
Are you okay?

236
00:17:08,434 --> 00:17:09,634
My mum is in there.

237
00:17:09,823 --> 00:17:12,298
Dupont, let the paramedics take care of them.

238
00:17:13,623 --> 00:17:14,912
I am going to help your mum.

239
00:17:15,283 --> 00:17:16,777
Gibs, get him out of here.

240
00:17:18,503 --> 00:17:20,655
4750 and rising. Let's go.

241
00:17:22,303 --> 00:17:24,077
Come on, lights on, Hunsaker!

242
00:17:28,223 --> 00:17:29,099
Can you hear me?

243
00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:32,439
You're going to be okay.

244
00:17:32,523 --> 00:17:33,572
I am going to help you.

245
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:37,781
Are you suicidal?

246
00:17:38,463 --> 00:17:40,121
Dupont, put that suit pack on.

247
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:42,737
She is pinning in the car. The fume is going to kill her.

248
00:17:43,023 --> 00:17:46,543
If this tank goes up, we and half of ... are counted to your history.

249
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,373
5800! Come on, people.

250
00:17:50,823 --> 00:17:51,792
Your son is okay.

251
00:17:52,423 --> 00:17:53,578
Now breathe in this.

252
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,979
5300! 5500!

253
00:17:56,303 --> 00:17:58,533
...

254
00:18:01,903 --> 00:18:05,937
6300. Coming down! I've got to love this job.

255
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:10,836
One of our senior expertizers?

256
00:18:10,943 --> 00:18:14,220
No, actually he's ... from upstate of New York.

257
00:18:15,983 --> 00:18:17,555
His name is Martin Zeller.

258
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:19,413
Has a little office on main street.

259
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:25,214
He wrote up 253 eye-glass prescriptions last year and gives out little lemon lollipops.

260
00:18:25,303 --> 00:18:26,959
Sydney fled to reflirt the barber?

261
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,595
Well, just before this was taken,

262
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:32,495
he was on this elevator.

263
00:18:33,183 --> 00:18:34,334
The tower elevator.

264
00:18:34,935 --> 00:18:36,435
So he is a probably a client.

265
00:18:36,743 --> 00:18:38,071
Let me see Jarod's sketching again.

266
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:44,497
It's gone.

267
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:36,198
- Hi,Todd.
- No comment.

268
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,421
I am not a reporter.

269
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:40,622
Then what do you want?

270
00:19:41,963 --> 00:19:44,714
I came here to tell you that I think father is innocent.

271
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:47,212
I guess that is why he jumped in front of a bus.

272
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:48,513
Now get out of my face.

273
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:50,839
I was with him on the bench.

274
00:19:53,503 --> 00:19:54,822
You're the guy who saved his life?

275
00:19:55,783 --> 00:19:57,135
I wish I could move faster.

276
00:19:58,503 --> 00:20:00,598
Father didn't care about his life for ours.

277
00:20:01,903 --> 00:20:02,713
Who ask you to?

278
00:20:42,183 --> 00:20:43,138
Nothing.

279
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:48,139
Nineteen bottles of beer on the wall, nineteen bottles of beer.

280
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,940
If one of the bottles happen to fall, um.....

281
00:20:53,143 --> 00:20:53,995
What's in that?

282
00:20:54,396 --> 00:20:55,096
MZT.

283
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:55,938
Are you crazy?

284
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:59,142
Relax. Dan sealed this holding.

285
00:21:00,823 --> 00:21:01,517
It is?

286
00:21:01,618 --> 00:21:02,718
Yes.

287
00:21:03,183 --> 00:21:07,632
And it has been for the last five hours.

288
00:21:07,943 --> 00:21:09,840
The accident wasn't Dan's fault.

289
00:21:10,183 --> 00:21:11,357
He didn't kill Larry Meyers.

290
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,297
If he didn't, who did?

291
00:21:18,798 --> 00:21:24,098
Eighteen bottles beer on the wall, eighteen bottles of beer, um....

292
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:43,842
You have a new mail.

293
00:21:50,403 --> 00:21:51,299
Is this the man?

294
00:21:52,483 --> 00:21:54,961
No, no, no. The eyes are brown.

295
00:21:55,743 --> 00:21:58,374
Watch yourself on the mind that police get to draw this.

296
00:21:58,675 --> 00:21:59,175
Think.

297
00:21:59,783 --> 00:22:01,241
But it will help if I know who he was.

298
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:02,842
Is he your father?

299
00:22:03,023 --> 00:22:04,078
No.

300
00:22:04,663 --> 00:22:08,939
Here, of the middle of the right eyebrow, were spot, an imperfection.

301
00:22:09,643 --> 00:22:10,217
Yes.

302
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:13,218
That's it.

303
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:17,419
But his eyes,

304
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,020
Sydney.

305
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:20,711
Are you crying?

306
00:22:22,903 --> 00:22:23,756
Of course not.

307
00:22:27,343 --> 00:22:28,561
Did that man hurt you?

308
00:22:29,783 --> 00:22:31,321
Sydney is in trouble, isn't he?

309
00:22:32,823 --> 00:22:36,552
How is it that you know everything that's happening in this place?

310
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:37,778
Intuition.

311
00:22:38,463 --> 00:22:40,699
We saw your little drawing of Martin Zeller.

312
00:22:41,143 --> 00:22:41,793
Who is he?

313
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,494
I don't know exactly.

314
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:46,855
But I remember how sydney was feeling when I ran that simulation.

315
00:22:47,383 --> 00:22:48,955
Who is he?

316
00:22:49,383 --> 00:22:50,982
Sydney wants to tell you, he will.

317
00:22:51,383 --> 00:22:54,181
Just to find out where the Center traveller offices put Zeller up.

318
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,533
Sydney will be there.

319
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:58,178
How do I know this is not one of your boom ..., Jarod?

320
00:22:58,363 --> 00:23:01,219
If you care about Sydney at all, go alone.

321
00:23:02,103 --> 00:23:04,554
No sweapers, no cleaners.

322
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,661
I just hope you get there in time.

323
00:23:08,583 --> 00:23:09,811
In time for what?

324
00:23:10,863 --> 00:23:11,818
To stop him.

325
00:23:15,703 --> 00:23:19,662
Stop. You should be here twenty minutes ago. You are late.

326
00:23:20,743 --> 00:23:21,600
You are right.

327
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:23,218
I am very late.

328
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:29,760
You don't remember me.

329
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:33,872
There are so many of us you can't remember the names.

330
00:23:34,763 --> 00:23:37,017
I don't know what you are talking about.

331
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:38,818
You are a mad man.

332
00:23:38,983 --> 00:23:40,292
You should hear every name.

333
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:42,693
But your time has run out.

334
00:23:44,543 --> 00:23:48,356
At my age, time means nothing.

335
00:23:51,423 --> 00:23:53,459
I believe this does.

336
00:23:55,823 --> 00:23:58,037
Do it, if you will.

337
00:23:59,623 --> 00:24:02,040
Frankly, I am tired of hiding.

338
00:24:07,441 --> 00:24:07,941
No.

339
00:24:10,003 --> 00:24:10,995
It is too easy.

340
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,152
You're willing to hear me out?

341
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:16,998
Yes? And then?

342
00:24:19,223 --> 00:24:21,383
Then¡­ I will kill you.

343
00:24:27,743 --> 00:24:28,673
Who won the fight?

344
00:24:29,543 --> 00:24:30,419
Go to hell!

345
00:24:30,703 --> 00:24:34,063
Guess you are defending him, your father that you said you don't care about.

346
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:35,602
Won conference three years in a row.

347
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:38,412
He's proud of you.

348
00:24:39,943 --> 00:24:40,935
He told me.

349
00:24:41,036 --> 00:24:41,736
When?

350
00:24:42,103 --> 00:24:43,661
Just before he tried to kill himself?

351
00:24:43,943 --> 00:24:46,098
All of he was thinking about was you and your mother.

352
00:24:46,583 --> 00:24:48,836
He thought by killing himself he could stop the questions

353
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:50,837
and that he could ease the pressure on both of you.

354
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:54,117
I am not saying it's right.

355
00:24:54,518 --> 00:24:56,118
But it's just what he was feeling.

356
00:25:01,063 --> 00:25:03,040
An insect made out of medal and wire.

357
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,756
Fishing lure.

358
00:25:07,663 --> 00:25:08,618
Like bait.

359
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:09,619
Yeah.

360
00:25:10,703 --> 00:25:11,961
Dad makes this as a hobby.

361
00:25:13,783 --> 00:25:14,939
This is my lucky one.

362
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:18,020
Got me a bite every time we went for a trial.

363
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:20,662
I saw a picture of you and your father fishing.

364
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:22,771
It looks like fun.

365
00:25:24,343 --> 00:25:25,642
You know when fishing with your dad?

366
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:28,279
I wasn't lucky enough to know my father.

367
00:25:30,203 --> 00:25:31,319
You know yours.

368
00:25:32,703 --> 00:25:33,894
Take advantage of it.

369
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,421
What is it?

370
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:46,221
The night before¡­

371
00:25:50,143 --> 00:25:52,680
before he was on that bench with you,

372
00:25:55,923 --> 00:25:58,679
we got a really bad fight and I said some stupid stuff.

373
00:26:01,263 --> 00:26:04,439
I told him that the accident was his fault, I told him...

374
00:26:05,183 --> 00:26:05,938
What did you say?

375
00:26:08,063 --> 00:26:09,782
I told him that he didn't deserve to live.

376
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,673
I don't want him to die.

377
00:26:20,903 --> 00:26:22,521
I don't want my father to die.

I even brought you a cup of coffee.

You are not the only one with the chemistry degree.

389
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,375
Impressive.

390
00:28:26,463 --> 00:28:30,958
Why someone with your seniority in your chemistry background still do a nasty job like transport?

391
00:28:31,943 --> 00:28:37,458
- You can double your salary in research and development.
- Yeah, double my migraines. Here, pull over and I get to check on this one.

392
00:29:36,663 --> 00:29:37,639
Got you!

393
00:29:43,523 --> 00:29:45,395
It almost looks like an accident, doesn't it?

394
00:29:50,923 --> 00:29:52,479
- These are release papers.
- Um.

395
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:52,980
So?

396
00:29:53,263 --> 00:29:55,201
- You signed fifty-two containers.
- Yeah.

397
00:29:55,303 --> 00:29:56,937
Only forty-two were buried in Nevada.

398
00:30:00,143 --> 00:30:01,198
Where the other ten go?

399
00:30:01,283 --> 00:30:03,716
Horace Strickland had them delivered to drug dealers.

400
00:30:03,817 --> 00:30:07,117
Strickland had felony drug smuggling charge as in FBI record.

401
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:08,018
Heroin.

402
00:30:09,263 --> 00:30:11,736
My guess he was smuggling them in the extra containers.

403
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:14,554
Who would examine the container label hazardous?

404
00:30:15,303 --> 00:30:17,071
Strickland's bank account was getting pretty fat

405
00:30:17,963 --> 00:30:20,538
minus few payments to Larry Meyers.

406
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:22,572
Meyers was in on this?

407
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,340
He was withdrawing money out of Strickland's,

408
00:30:24,341 --> 00:30:26,441
threatening to blow Wilkes on the operation.

409
00:30:28,463 --> 00:30:29,854
So on the day of the accident,

410
00:30:31,183 --> 00:30:33,951
Strickland spike the MZT shippment.

411
00:30:34,803 --> 00:30:36,959
So that would eat through Dan's new seal,

412
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:39,382
and eat through Larry Meyers.

413
00:30:44,223 --> 00:30:45,051
It is him.

414
00:30:46,703 --> 00:30:47,316
Who is he?

415
00:30:52,423 --> 00:30:55,372
I received a package of my family's belonging today, Jarod.

416
00:30:58,683 --> 00:31:01,155
It was lost for a very long time.

417
00:31:02,983 --> 00:31:05,614
This picture is of my brother Jacob and myself.

418
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:07,841
Our first communion.

419
00:31:09,623 --> 00:31:10,561
Is you twin?

420
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:14,358
Jacob is the only family I have.

421
00:31:16,303 --> 00:31:17,419
I wish I had a family.

422
00:31:26,103 --> 00:31:29,378
Jean-Michael lived with his family in a little farm.

423
00:31:30,063 --> 00:31:31,376
It built near Lyon.

424
00:31:32,503 --> 00:31:36,298
And his work only mattered to him so far as it held

425
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:38,299
his wife, Greta,

426
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,700
and his two sons.

427
00:31:42,023 --> 00:31:42,617
Twins.

428
00:31:46,123 --> 00:31:47,217
Sydney!

429
00:31:51,983 --> 00:31:53,382
You do remember.

430
00:31:54,183 --> 00:31:56,033
Jacob was your brother.

431
00:31:56,943 --> 00:31:59,073
Very good, Herr Doktor.

432
00:32:04,943 --> 00:32:07,953
And he is all the family I have left.

433
00:32:09,783 --> 00:32:11,275
Because the rest,

434
00:32:12,423 --> 00:32:14,813
you murdered because they were have no use to you.

435
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,339
Who are you to pass judgement?

436
00:32:19,543 --> 00:32:20,198
Who?

437
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:28,718
This is for Jean-Michael.

438
00:32:29,623 --> 00:32:31,176
And this is for Greta.

439
00:32:32,677 --> 00:32:33,577
Sydney!

440
00:32:33,778 --> 00:32:34,578
No!

441
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,331
Oh, my...

442
00:32:44,163 --> 00:32:45,099
Who is Mr. Zeller?

443
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,700
There is no Zeller.

444
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:48,301
This is Dr. Krieg.

445
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:50,819
Dr. Werner Krieg.

446
00:32:51,323 --> 00:32:56,151
The ambitious young physician assigned to Dachau in 1944.

447
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,516
The Nazis were testing us.

448
00:33:03,223 --> 00:33:05,012
They were looking for ways,

449
00:33:05,803 --> 00:33:09,637
to accelerate the reproduction of the master race.

450
00:33:10,523 --> 00:33:13,698
Jacob and I became Krieg's favorite subjects.

451
00:33:15,363 --> 00:33:17,236
We were only children.

452
00:33:19,343 --> 00:33:22,176
He set our whole family to the gas chambers.

453
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:25,638
So that he could have us for his experiments.

454
00:33:26,983 --> 00:33:29,461
Sydney, you are not Jewish.

455
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,119
I am a twin, remember?

456
00:34:21,103 --> 00:34:24,491
Strickland? Big shippment is transported tonight.

457
00:34:25,343 --> 00:34:26,874
Happy to help if you need me.

458
00:34:28,543 --> 00:34:30,518
Oh I figured you want to be alone.

459
00:34:55,043 --> 00:34:57,220
Je..., Jarod, you scared the winder on me.

460
00:34:58,223 --> 00:34:59,722
Looks like we have one more item.

461
00:35:00,903 --> 00:35:02,678
That's MZT. I don't have any gear on.

462
00:35:02,779 --> 00:35:07,079
Neither did Larry Meyers, or the other two victims, did they, Horace?

463
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:07,980
That's not funny.

464
00:35:08,143 --> 00:35:09,254
... by MZT.

465
00:35:11,223 --> 00:35:11,960
Is it?

466
00:35:12,143 --> 00:35:12,739
Got you!

467
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,702
Jarod, I can't move in here.

468
00:35:20,903 --> 00:35:22,403
I would relax if I were you.

469
00:35:22,883 --> 00:35:26,259
You're going to be in there for the next whole twenty thousand years.

470
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:27,881
Jarod, that's MZT!

471
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:28,672
Um.

472
00:35:29,373 --> 00:35:31,673
The deadliest pesticide in the world.

473
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:33,760
Turns your inside to jelly.

474
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:37,120
But it won't corrode Dan Healy's seal, will it?

475
00:35:37,223 --> 00:35:38,998
Yes, yes. I already did.

476
00:35:39,563 --> 00:35:40,498
Of course.

477
00:35:41,143 --> 00:35:43,941
Because you added this to it.

478
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:47,958
So you can get rid of your blackmailer Larry Meyers.

479
00:35:48,303 --> 00:35:50,822
- and continue smuggling drugs.
- I didn't do anything!

480
00:35:51,103 --> 00:35:52,596
You murdered three people.

481
00:35:53,897 --> 00:35:55,197
You framed Dan Healy.

482
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:58,938
He was convinced that the only way that he could protect his family

483
00:35:59,023 --> 00:36:02,296
was to leave his wife without a husband and his son without a father.

484
00:36:02,783 --> 00:36:05,561
You destroyed his life, didn't you?

485
00:36:06,362 --> 00:36:08,562
Didn't you? Didn't you? Didn't you?

486
00:36:09,263 --> 00:36:11,618
Yes, yes. Now don't do this to me.

487
00:36:12,023 --> 00:36:12,554
Why not?

488
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:14,655
You did it to them.

489
00:36:16,956 --> 00:36:18,656
Jarod, Jarod...

490
00:36:52,183 --> 00:36:53,133
Twinkie cream.

491
00:36:58,623 --> 00:36:59,700
The food of the Gods.

492
00:37:04,943 --> 00:37:07,619
Are you familiar with Nietzsche, doctor?

493
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,420
Um, yes.

494
00:37:12,303 --> 00:37:15,417
You are like the mad man who runs into the market place.

495
00:37:15,703 --> 00:37:17,273
screaming for God.

496
00:37:18,263 --> 00:37:20,921
But he'll never find him because the God is dead.

497
00:37:21,963 --> 00:37:23,718
God is dead, you killed him.

498
00:37:27,003 --> 00:37:29,097
We are both professionals, doctor.

499
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:31,514
I know who you work for.

500
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:33,561
I know the work they do.

501
00:37:34,062 --> 00:37:35,362
The work you do.

502
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:38,656
What do you think that would have happened to you and Jacob,

503
00:37:39,043 --> 00:37:40,811
if I had not selected you?

504
00:37:42,943 --> 00:37:46,802
Would you be here now, so full of purpose?

505
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:51,819
If God is dead, we all killed him.

506
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,220
Syndey.

507
00:38:09,303 --> 00:38:10,659
Do you remember the day¡­

508
00:38:12,823 --> 00:38:14,079
my mother was buried?

509
00:38:16,903 --> 00:38:19,315
I will never forget that day.

510
00:38:20,303 --> 00:38:22,317
You made me feel safe.

511
00:38:23,983 --> 00:38:25,862
Safer than my own father.

512
00:38:25,963 --> 00:38:27,263
And all you did,

513
00:38:31,423 --> 00:38:33,278
was to hold my hand.

514
00:38:40,023 --> 00:38:41,214
Give me your gun.

515
00:38:58,043 --> 00:39:00,452
He is a monster.

516
00:39:01,983 --> 00:39:06,661
Do yourself and the world, a favor.

517
00:39:20,383 --> 00:39:21,377
I cannot.

518
00:39:24,383 --> 00:39:25,252
Why?

519
00:39:26,623 --> 00:39:27,358
Jarod.

520
00:39:28,863 --> 00:39:30,001
Don't you see?

521
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:33,453
I became the monster.

522
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:43,618
''Deadly Spill Revealed as Murder''

523
00:39:45,023 --> 00:39:46,553
It's the other day on the bench.

524
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:49,934
I realize now,

525
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:54,080
I did the wrong thing for all the wrong reasons.

526
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:59,780
The important thing is you are here, now.

527
00:40:01,223 --> 00:40:02,457
Like someone once said,

528
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:05,758
Nothing is more important than family.

529
00:40:13,543 --> 00:40:14,298
Dad?

530
00:40:21,883 --> 00:40:22,611
I love you.

531
00:40:33,583 --> 00:40:34,957
This will bring you luck too.

532
00:40:40,543 --> 00:40:41,298
Thank you.

533
00:40:44,223 --> 00:40:45,378
Thank you.

534
00:40:51,663 --> 00:40:53,594
Take care, twinkie man.

535
00:41:10,983 --> 00:41:12,511
I wish I had family.

536
00:41:15,063 --> 00:41:16,018
What is that, Sydney?

537
00:41:18,303 --> 00:41:19,002
On the war.

538
00:41:21,843 --> 00:41:23,561
You were in a concentration camp?

539
00:41:24,043 --> 00:41:26,135
My brother and I were kept in a cold and dark place.

540
00:41:27,983 --> 00:41:28,962
For many years.

541
00:41:32,263 --> 00:41:33,259
Like the Center?

542
00:41:34,823 --> 00:41:36,081
Not exactly, Jarod.

543
00:41:38,023 --> 00:41:38,978
Did they hurt you?

544
00:41:39,483 --> 00:41:41,177
Not as much as they hurted my family.

545
00:41:43,523 --> 00:41:44,541
They killed them all.

546
00:41:53,523 --> 00:41:54,595
I will be your family.

547
00:42:04,663 --> 00:42:08,099
I just got words that Dr. Krieg has been extradited to lsrael.

548
00:42:08,583 --> 00:42:09,521
This is just arrived.

549
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:13,022
Miss Parker.

550
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:17,092
Thank you.

551
00:42:19,393 --> 00:42:20,593
Syd.

552
00:42:21,903 --> 00:42:24,663
How many psychiatrists does it take to change one light-bulb?

553
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:25,798
One.

554
00:42:28,903 --> 00:42:30,939
But the light-bulb has to want to change.

555
00:43:00,323 --> 00:43:01,442
Are you alright?

556
00:43:01,843 --> 00:43:03,443
Yes, well.

557
00:43:04,023 --> 00:43:06,676
All my life I revenged against him, Jarod.

558
00:43:07,183 --> 00:43:09,192
When I saw him the last time,

559
00:43:12,343 --> 00:43:13,896
I saw myself.

560
00:43:14,163 --> 00:43:16,040
You are not a monster, Sydney.

561
00:43:20,983 --> 00:43:22,175
And you are still¡­

562
00:43:23,583 --> 00:43:24,536
my family.

563
00:43:29,063 --> 00:43:29,935
Tell me something.

564
00:43:32,463 --> 00:43:35,121
Have you ever been fishing?

565
00:43:36,383 --> 00:43:37,338
Why?

566
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:38,656
Maybe we'll go,

567
00:43:39,657 --> 00:43:40,457
some day,

568
00:43:41,463 --> 00:43:42,381
just you and me.

569
00:44:02,382 --> 00:44:04,382
