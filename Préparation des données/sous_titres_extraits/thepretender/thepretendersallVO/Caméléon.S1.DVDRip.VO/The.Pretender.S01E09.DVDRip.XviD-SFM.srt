00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:47,404
At least three times a week.

You follow Harrigan,

214
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,852
I watched him lead
a response with one pumper.

215
00:16:36,922 --> 00:16:39,755
He put out a six-alarm fire
before the other five even got there.

216
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:42,418
Sounds like he takes
a pretty aggressive approach.

pulled the team back.

I'll definitely
be wanting that drink.

I can't believe you let all this energy
go to waste on a sales job.

00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,459

235
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:04,869
I thought you weren't

Nancy, what are you doing here?

243
00:18:41,146 --> 00:18:43,410
I was in the neighborhood.
Thought I'd drop off your work shirts.

244
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:45,745
- You don't have to do this.
- I know. I want to.

245
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:47,751
Business looks good.

246
00:18:47,819 --> 00:18:51,812
Oh, since breakfast this morning,
on top of which, Manny calls in sick.

247
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,085
Manny is sick?
Well, who's cooking?

248
00:18:54,159 --> 00:18:56,889
<i>Hey, Herb.</i>

249
00:18:56,961 --> 00:18:59,156
What should I do
with these balls of meat?

250
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:02,495
I think you two know each other.
I'll take care of the meatballs...

251
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:05,764
- <i>if you'll finish cleaning up, okay, Jarod?</i>
- Sure.

252
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:10,366
- Careful, it's hot.
- Okay, thanks.

253
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:15,812
Great guy.

254
00:19:18,383 --> 00:19:21,910
- You have no right to be here.
- I came by to pay my respects...

255
00:19:21,986 --> 00:19:24,819
and the cook called in sick,
so I offered to help.

256
00:19:24,889 --> 00:19:28,086
- You would have done the same thing.
- What do you want?

257
00:19:29,094 --> 00:19:31,688
A truce would be nice.

258
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:37,429
<i>Look, Lieutenant, I know we haven't</i>
<i>gotten off to a very good start.</i>

259
00:19:37,502 --> 00:19:41,563
I just want you to know that I
understand how you must be feeling.

260
00:19:41,639 --> 00:19:45,700
- Really?
- <i>Tamara Copeland was your best friend.</i>

261
00:19:45,777 --> 00:19:48,769
I'm not trying to take her place.

262
00:19:48,847 --> 00:19:51,247
I just wanna do my job.

263
00:19:53,051 --> 00:19:55,611
Grab those plates, would you?

264
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:02,991
- You're not gonna make this easy, are you?
- What?

265
00:20:03,061 --> 00:20:04,995
Me hating you.

266
00:20:08,032 --> 00:20:10,466
- Thanks, Nancy.
- <i>See you later.</i>

267
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:13,197
I worry about that girl.

268
00:20:13,271 --> 00:20:17,332
- What do you mean?
- It seems like she can't let go of what happened.

269
00:20:17,408 --> 00:20:21,276
It feels like she blames
herself for Tamara's death.

270
00:20:24,816 --> 00:20:26,784
It was an accident, wasn't it?

271
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:30,379
My daughter was
a great firefighter.

272
00:20:30,455 --> 00:20:32,753
And I loved her more than
anything in this life.

273
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,025
But she knew this was
dangerous work...

274
00:20:37,095 --> 00:20:39,188
and people die.

275
00:20:41,065 --> 00:20:43,431
I gotta go check on
the meatballs.

276
00:20:57,282 --> 00:21:00,217
Broots, another
possibility from Angelo.

277
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,590
Sydney, Broots.

278
00:21:15,667 --> 00:21:19,569
I'm confident it's a landlocked state,
either Pennsylvania or West Virginia.

279
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,731
This isn't an exact science.

280
00:21:24,809 --> 00:21:28,677
It's an experimental technique
with a huge human element involved.

281
00:21:28,746 --> 00:21:32,409
- Been up all night, haven't you?
- Uh-huh.

282
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:35,352
Let me get you some coffee.

283
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,820
Maybe that might help.

284
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,192
- Oh, man. Who brought that damn mutt?
- Guilty, sir.

285
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:54,932
Well, keep him out
of the house, will you?

286
00:21:55,006 --> 00:21:57,668
Hey, Hank.
Off with the shoes. House rules.

00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:06,782
Between that mutt and these slobs,
I'm gonna have to build a moat.

290
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:09,376
Cap's a regular Bob Vila.
He built the bar.

291
00:22:09,454 --> 00:22:11,786
I'm gonna build
a garage this summer.

292
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:13,915
A remodel this beautiful
has to be expensive.

293
00:22:13,992 --> 00:22:16,426
- Well, there's a lot of sweat equity.
- <i>[Roy] Yeah.</i>

294
00:22:16,494 --> 00:22:19,429
- Our sweat, his equity.
- Check the hamburgers, Roy.

00:22:19,497 --> 00:22:23,228
<i>And don't let 'em burn.</i>

296
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:27,567
Good kid. Can't handle a belt sander
to save his life, but he's a good kid.

297
00:22:28,906 --> 00:22:32,774
You know, this railing...
1934 ladder truck.

298
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:35,278
The very first one
the Fighting 16th ever had.

299
00:22:35,346 --> 00:22:39,612
Harrigan's used that railing a lot,
and I don't mean in the line of duty.

300
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:41,948
- [Chuckling]
- <i>You know...</i>

301
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,250
you landed yourself
in a very special unit, Jarod.

302
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,620
Historical is more like it.

303
00:22:46,691 --> 00:22:49,888
This is the first unit in the city
with two female firefighters.

304
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:53,124
Yeah, with Gleason and Copeland there,
it felt like a real family.

305
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:58,300
- Nancy misses Copeland very much.
- We all do, son.

306
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:02,203
Must've taken a lot of guts for Copeland
to run into that burning warehouse.

307
00:23:02,273 --> 00:23:05,242
<i>Yeah, electrical fire like that.</i>

308
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:08,746
That place must've been
hotter than Satan's armpit.

309
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:14,752
<i>Copeland was good, but she had</i>
<i>an overzealous sense of the heroic.</i>

310
00:23:14,819 --> 00:23:17,151
I told everybody to hang back.

311
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,781
She thought she heard screams
and went inside half-cocked.

312
00:23:19,857 --> 00:23:22,724
Really? That wasn't
in the papers.

313
00:23:22,794 --> 00:23:24,989
<i>Copeland did outstanding</i>
<i>work on this team.</i>

314
00:23:25,063 --> 00:23:29,466
I wasn't about to let her
be disgraced over one mistake.

315
00:23:29,534 --> 00:23:34,301
<i>I called the hose crew in to bring in</i>
<i>a line and went in after her.</i>

316
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:37,637
By the time I got inside, she was
sucked into the smoke and flames.

317
00:23:38,776 --> 00:23:41,711
- I never found her.
- That was very brave.

318
00:23:43,648 --> 00:23:46,640
Truth is, bravery had
nothing to do with it.

319
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:50,814
As long as I'm in charge, this team
will never leave one of its own hanging.

320
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:09,366
You're not going to accept this
as a passing good mood, are you?

321
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,807
- I know you too well.
- Don't be so sure.

322
00:24:12,877 --> 00:24:14,811
But I'm concerned.

323
00:24:14,879 --> 00:24:17,677
Mr. Patrick seems
awfully transient.

324
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:21,344
What I do for recreation
is my business.

325
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:23,353
Besides, I like him.

326
00:24:23,421 --> 00:24:25,912
Ask yourself this then.

327
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,892
Are there enough
healthy relationships in your life...

328
00:24:29,961 --> 00:24:33,226
to compensate for what
you're doing for recreation?

329
00:24:33,297 --> 00:24:36,926
These entanglements?

- Oh, thanks.

He's been paging me all afternoon.

Yeah, he just
pulled out of here.

499

- No. Oh, he left you this.

- I wanna show you this neat trick I taught Ember.

535
00:41:01,836 --> 00:41:05,397
You see, I've treated the wiring
throughout the house with this accelerant.

536
00:41:05,473 --> 00:41:08,442
That way the flames
and the fire spread completely.

537
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:12,309

No one will ever know.
