- Excuse me?
- Dumpin' hot sauce on top of chili pepper gumbo?

4
00:00:15,899 --> 00:00:18,197
You might as well
sit down on a blowtorch.

5
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:20,269
I like it hot.

6
00:00:22,172 --> 00:00:24,072
- Mmm!
- Whoo!

7
00:00:24,174 --> 00:00:26,267
Let me get you a glass of water.

Outsmarted, definitely.

16
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:55,027
But hustled? There's no gentlemen

<i>You know as well as I do,</i>
<i>there's no stopping Eddie Fontenot.</i>

- Whoo!
- He don't appreciate that.

23
00:01:41,818 --> 00:01:43,718
He don't appreciate that.

This is for you, Marvin.

<i>Girl, have you lost your mind?</i>

27
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:11,344
You don't point a gun at a man like Eddie
Fontenot unless you plan to pull the trigger.

28
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:13,813
I did.

29

Marvin was your brother.

<i>You owe him better than this.</i>

Oh.

37
00:02:48,885 --> 00:02:50,910
It happened two weeks ago.

38
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,683
<i>Marvin was the closet thing</i>
<i>to a father that Billie knew.</i>

39

<i>She worshipped the man.</i>

40
00:02:56,826 --> 00:03:00,262
She was also the one
that found his body...

41
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:03,196
out in the alley behind the club.

42
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:05,631
That must have been tough for her.

43
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:09,535
[Chuckles]
Marvin was a good man.

44
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:12,130
Best pool player I ever saw.

45
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:14,142
He just hustled the wrong man.

46
00:03:14,244 --> 00:03:17,304
The devil at the pool table.

47
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:20,974
His name is Eddie Fontenot.

48
00:03:21,084 --> 00:03:24,144
Police could never prove
that he pulled the trigger. But-

49
00:03:24,254 --> 00:03:26,245
You think he did.

50
00:03:27,757 --> 00:03:31,693
Marvin was lookin' for a big score.

51
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,592
Enough money to send Billie
to a fancy drama school...

52
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:36,597
and get him off the road for good.

53
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:40,795
She was his life. He just wanted
to give her a different future.

54
00:03:40,904 --> 00:03:44,635
So Eddie Fontenot...

55
00:03:44,741 --> 00:03:49,110
invited Marvin over for a pool game.

56
00:03:49,212 --> 00:03:51,237
A thousand dollars a rack.

57
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:54,077
- That's big money.
- <i>Had to be.</i>

Eddie Fontenot let in his house...

59
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:59,019
come in the back door
and carried a mop.

60
00:03:59,122 --> 00:04:01,181
So what happened?

61
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:05,785
Marvin beat him
like a rented mule.

62
00:04:08,131 --> 00:04:13,364
He was up 50 grand when I left to
come back here to close up the-the club.

63
00:04:13,469 --> 00:04:17,997
If you think Fontenot killed your brother,
why do you allow him in your club?

64
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:20,837
The club is all I got.

65
00:04:20,944 --> 00:04:23,936
<i>Eddie Fontenot could make</i>
<i>one phone call...</i>

and I'd wake up to a pile of cinders.

67
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:32,815
Don't you think it's time
that somebody stopped him?

68
00:04:32,922 --> 00:04:34,822
There's only one way to get Eddie.

69
00:04:34,924 --> 00:04:38,360
- How's that?
- You a pool player, Mr. Pepper?

Earl said that Marvin

00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,570
What happened to your real family?

126
00:08:09,672 --> 00:08:11,902
My daddy died in a car accident
when I was a baby.

127
00:08:12,008 --> 00:08:14,533
Mama got sick and passed
a few years later.

128
00:08:14,644 --> 00:08:18,410
There was no other family. Marvin
was their best friend, so he adopted me.

129
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:20,744
It was lucky for you.

00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:33,328
I'd just gotten the lead in <i>My Fair Lady</i>

132
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:37,058
which was a big deal 'cause
I was only a sophomore.

00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:42,103
Marvin stands up in the club and
tells everybody how proud he is of me.

Uh, listen up, ladies and gentlemen.

135
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,166
My little Billie is gonna play

He always wanted me to become a singer,
just like my mother.

How do you plan to do that?

144
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:23,576
If I can hustle my way into
Eddie Fontenot's world like Marvin did...

145
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:26,978
maybe I can find some evidence
that would connect him to the killing.

146
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,017
You play pool?

147
00:09:29,118 --> 00:09:33,384
Well, I'm familiar with the architectural
theory of dynamic symmetry...

148
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:37,482
as well as Descartes' theory
of coordinate geometry, um, lines, angles.

149
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:39,788
- You ever chalk a cue?
- Excuse me?

150
00:09:39,895 --> 00:09:43,592
You can put away
your math books, Mr. Pepper.

151
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:47,533
They may help you learn how to play pool,
but they can't make you a pool player.

152
00:09:47,637 --> 00:09:50,470
No. But you can.

153
00:09:50,573 --> 00:09:52,905
Me?

00:09:55,077 --> 00:09:56,977
Do it for Marvin.

00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:06,853
All right. Let's pick you out a cue.
Okay.

- Uh-
- Not bad.

162
00:10:35,284 --> 00:10:37,275

00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:47,061
It's not the shot you're hittin'
you need to think about.

It's the one three strokes ahead.
Nine on the side.

165
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:17,020
Remember, pool is a mind game.

166
00:11:17,126 --> 00:11:19,959
Make your opponent think about you,
and his game is lost.

167

<i>Can you do that?

When Marvin met her,

never tell Billie that he was her father.

Marvin was a friend.

00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,188
Nobody died.

334
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,622
And Bridget seems like a-a nice person...

335
00:23:30,725 --> 00:23:33,819
<i>and she makes your father happy.</i>

336
00:23:33,929 --> 00:23:37,296
It's so hard to watch him
throw his life away like this.

337
00:23:37,399 --> 00:23:39,959
Then don't.

338
00:23:40,068 --> 00:23:43,196
If it's making you this miserable, maybe
you should stop spending time with them.

339
00:23:43,305 --> 00:23:45,705
They're my family.

340
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:48,799
Maybe you should think
about starting a new one.

341
00:23:52,147 --> 00:23:54,240
<i>[Earl's Voice]</i>
<i>She was also the one...</i>

342
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:58,479
<i>that found his body out</i>
<i>in the alley behind the club.</i>

343
00:23:58,587 --> 00:24:00,919
<i>[Billie's Voice]</i>
<i>Marvin stands up at the club...</i>

344
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:03,820
<i>and tells everybody</i>
<i>how proud he is of me.</i>

345
00:24:03,925 --> 00:24:07,053
<i>But that dream died</i>
<i>in the alley along with him.</i>

346
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:10,325

347
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,200
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Let's see him sink a nine ball now.</i>

348
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,171
- <i>[Jarod] Where am I?</i>
- <i>[Fontenot] You're in my home.</i>

349
00:24:28,283 --> 00:24:31,184
I did warn you
about that neighborhood.

350
00:24:38,527 --> 00:24:41,155
Good thing my driver
happened by when he did.

351
00:24:41,263 --> 00:24:43,026
<i>You might have been killed.</i>

352
00:24:43,131 --> 00:24:45,190
I count my blessings.

353
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:48,929
Good for you.
Let's play some pool.

354
00:25:11,326 --> 00:25:14,693
[Chuckling]
A valiant attempt.

355
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,026
<i>But as Hamlet said...</i>

356
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:20,158
<i>"As he was valiant, I honor him.</i>

357
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:25,262
As he was ambitious, I slew him."

358
00:25:25,373 --> 00:25:28,467
Actually, Brutus said that...

359
00:25:28,577 --> 00:25:30,738
trying to justify killing Julius Caesar.

360
00:25:30,845 --> 00:25:34,474
But then he discovered there really is
no justification for cold-blooded murder.

361
00:25:34,583 --> 00:25:36,483
So he killed himself.

362
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:38,712
Well, I'm sure if Brutus
thought a little harder...

363
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,186
he would have come up
with a better solution.

364
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:43,655
It doesn't take a genius to know that...

365
00:25:43,758 --> 00:25:46,784
we live in a world where
only the truly fit can survive.

366
00:25:46,895 --> 00:25:52,265
Meaning that the unfit should
be eliminated, like Marvin Dupree?

367
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,667
Marvin didn't know his place,
so he paid the price.

368
00:25:58,773 --> 00:26:01,105
And what exactly was his place?

369
00:26:01,209 --> 00:26:04,178
Why, in the back of the bus, of course.

370
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,247
<i>[Young Jarod's Voice]</i>
<i>I'll never accept it.</i>

371
00:26:06,348 --> 00:26:08,316
- <i>[Young Sydney's Voice] It's called racism.</i>
- <i>I'll never accept it.</i>

372
00:26:08,416 --> 00:26:11,283
I believe you owe me
another thousand dollars.

373
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:20,294
- Are you doing some remodeling?
- Pardon me?

374
00:26:20,395 --> 00:26:22,295
I smell fresh paint.

375
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:24,524
Looks like you've just laid down
a brand-new carpet.

376
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:30,870
I like to keep
my home presentable...

377
00:26:30,972 --> 00:26:34,635
<i>for special guests</i>
<i>such as yourself.</i>

378
00:26:36,945 --> 00:26:38,845
Hmm.

379
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,351
- Another game?
- Not tonight.

380
00:26:45,453 --> 00:26:50,948
Well, like you said, Mr. Pepper: Sometimes
the balls roll your way; sometimes they don't.

381
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,926
Why don't we play again tomorrow...

382
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,327
when both my arms are working?

383
00:26:56,431 --> 00:26:59,491
Unless, of course,
you don't like the odds.

384
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:03,797
- It's a date.
- Good.

385
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:07,636
Tomorrow afternoon at Earl's.

386
00:27:07,742 --> 00:27:10,006
Now if you don't mind,
I'd like to use your restroom.

387
00:27:10,111 --> 00:27:13,740
By all means.
It's on your left, down the hall.

388
00:30:03,518 --> 00:30:04,519
<i>Well, that's not</i>
<i>your average scrapbook.</i>

389
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:07,079
<i>Well, that's not</i>
<i>your average scrapbook.</i>

390
00:30:07,188 --> 00:30:09,315
After Marvin was killed...

391
00:30:09,424 --> 00:30:12,552
I collected every scrap of information
I could on Fontenot...

392
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:14,560
tryin' to figure out...

393
00:30:14,662 --> 00:30:19,099
what would possess a man
to murder out of pure hate.

394
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,068
I found the answer in
an old Huntsville newspaper.

395
00:30:23,171 --> 00:30:25,435
I've seen that picture.

396
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:27,405
It's in a frame
in Fontenot's poolroom.

397
00:30:27,509 --> 00:30:30,876
<i>[Earl] Fontenot's daddy.</i>
<i>White sheets, burnin'crosses.</i>

398
00:30:30,979 --> 00:30:33,743
Fontenot's father was a member
of the Ku Klux Klan.

399
00:30:33,848 --> 00:30:35,748
Accordin' to people who would know.

400
00:30:37,619 --> 00:30:41,020
I paid a visit
to Fontenot's house tonight.

401
00:30:41,122 --> 00:30:44,250
He has two newly patched
bullet holes in his wall...

402
00:30:44,359 --> 00:30:46,259
and he laid down
a brand-new carpet.

403
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:51,355
- To cover up Marvin's blood?
- He was trying to cover up something.

404
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:53,366
But he's not the only one.

405
00:30:54,903 --> 00:30:57,269
<i>You told me that Billie's mother</i>
<i>left her fiancé...</i>

406
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,932
a few days before the wedding
and ran off with Marvin.

407
00:31:00,041 --> 00:31:01,406
That's right.

408
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:03,977
You left out a pretty important detail
from that story.

409
00:31:04,078 --> 00:31:07,844
<i>You told me that Marvin</i>
<i>was Billie's father...</i>

410
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:11,942
<i>but you didn't tell me</i>
<i>Eddie Fontenot was the fiancé.</i>

411
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:14,487
<i>Marvin was my daddy?</i>

412

- <i>[Jarod] Billie.</i>
- Marvin was my daddy.

413
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:20,624
- Billie-
- No.

414
00:31:20,728 --> 00:31:22,821
No more lies.

Uh, you and your brother.

419
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:53,418
- Daddy?
- Huh?

420
00:31:53,528 --> 00:31:57,624
There's something I need to tell you
about Brigitte.

421
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:00,997
I know you have issues with her.
But people change.

422
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:06,228
Look at us, all dressed up
on my wedding day.

423
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,572
I'm happier now than
I've been in a long, long time.

00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,673
- God, you're pretty.
- So there you are.

426
00:32:16,784 --> 00:32:19,082
- Mmm.
- Time to go.

427
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:22,418
Well, I can't keep
my bride waiting, now can I?

428
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,491
Okay.

[Chuckles] You haven't run the table
all day, Mr. Pepper.

432
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:46,746
I can practically feel that $50,000
in my pocket now.

433
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:53,882
You know, I'm beginning to think
that 50,000 isn't enough.

434
00:32:53,988 --> 00:32:55,888
Maybe we should put
some more on the line.

435
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,185
$50,000 is not enough for you?

436
00:32:58,292 --> 00:33:01,921
I wasn't talking about money. I was
talking about something far more costly...

437
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:05,022
like, uh, honor.

438
00:33:05,133 --> 00:33:07,226
What?

439
00:33:07,335 --> 00:33:13,103
That is, after all, what you lost
to Marvin Dupree, isn't it?

440
00:33:18,713 --> 00:33:21,409
I don't know what the hell
you are talkin' about, sir.

441
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:23,609
It finally occurred to me
that losing a game of pool...

442
00:33:23,718 --> 00:33:27,119
<i>or being hustled by Marvin Dupree</i>
<i>for a few thousand dollars...</i>

444
00:33:30,358 --> 00:33:33,452
<i>No, you killed him...</i>

445
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:36,655

<i>You just couldn't keep that hatred</i>

Who the hell are you?

448
00:33:44,672 --> 00:33:48,733
Powerful hatred,

00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:28,625
<i>speak now,</i>
<i>or forever hold your peace.</i>

497
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:47,876
By the powers vested in me
by the great state of Delaware...

498
00:37:47,982 --> 00:37:51,349
I hereby pronounce you
husband and wife.

499
00:37:53,487 --> 00:37:55,387
<i>You may kiss the bride.</i>

500
00:38:29,857 --> 00:38:31,757
[Laughing]

501
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:34,828
<i>[Classical]</i>

502
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,861
<i>Congratulations, Mrs. Parker.

503
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:44,563
I wish you and your husband
the very best.

504
00:38:44,672 --> 00:38:47,470
Thank you, Mr. Raines.

505
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,907
I intend to do
everything in my power...

506
00:38:50,011 --> 00:38:53,777
to make his golden years memorable.

507
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:55,906
I know <i>I'll</i> remember them.

508
00:38:56,017 --> 00:38:58,713
- Ah.
- Count on it.

509
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:01,379
I think I'll get some cake.

510
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,556
Beautiful ceremony, wasn't it?

511
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:07,957
The virgin veil was a nice touch.

512
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:17,064
[Chuckles]
Do you need a little motherly advice?

513
00:39:18,639 --> 00:39:22,006
Now that you mention it,
let's talk birth control...

514
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,977
as in the kind
Dr. Noah Lindquist provided for you.

515
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,241
<i>You do remember him, don't you?</i>

516
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:32,149
Then again, maybe you don't,
considering he doesn't exist.

517
00:39:34,088 --> 00:39:35,988
Someone's been a busy little beaver.

518
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:38,684
Misinformed, but busy.

519
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,819
You lied to my father
about being infertile.

520
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:46,628
You get yourself pregnant, and that makes it
real difficult to trim you off the family tree.

521
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:54,438
My husband and I have
a very trusting relationship.

522
00:40:00,181 --> 00:40:04,675
Just answer me this.

523
00:40:04,785 --> 00:40:09,381
What kind of a beast uses the miracle of birth
to cement her own position in life?

524
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:13,688
A baby with your father
would be a child of love.

525
00:40:13,794 --> 00:40:16,058
Nothing more, nothing less.

526
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:20,228
You were right
about one thing though.

527
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,859
If there were to be a child...

528
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:25,495
it would truly be a miracle.

529
00:40:25,606 --> 00:40:27,574
Thank you.

530
00:40:42,156 --> 00:40:46,217
<i>I wanna thank you all for comin'out</i>
<i>on this cold Memphis night.</i>

531
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:48,488
We got a special treat
for you this evening.

532
00:40:48,596 --> 00:40:50,689
I can't do this.

533
00:40:50,798 --> 00:40:54,256
Of course you can.
Just keep your father close to your heart.

534
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,132
You'll be just fine.

535
00:40:57,238 --> 00:40:59,536
<i>Please, put your hands together...</i>

536
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:04,668
and give a warm welcome
to Miss Billie Dupree.

537
00:41:04,778 --> 00:41:07,144
- <i>[Applause]</i>
- Go get 'em.

538
00:41:10,618 --> 00:41:12,677
Whoo!

539
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,790
<i>[Piano]</i>

540
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:22,226
I'd like to dedicate this song
to my father, Marvin Dupree...

541
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,797
<i>and to the man</i>
<i>who helped me find him.</i>

542
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,560
Thank you, Jarod.

543
00:41:30,037 --> 00:41:35,270
There's a somebody
I'm longing to see

544
00:41:35,376 --> 00:41:38,277
I hope that he

545
00:41:38,379 --> 00:41:42,975
<i>Turns out to be</i>

546
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:47,417
Someone who'll watch

547
00:41:47,521 --> 00:41:53,619
Over me

548
00:41:54,695 --> 00:42:00,190
<i>Where is that someone</i>

549
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:08,709
<i>To watch over me</i>

550
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:12,336
