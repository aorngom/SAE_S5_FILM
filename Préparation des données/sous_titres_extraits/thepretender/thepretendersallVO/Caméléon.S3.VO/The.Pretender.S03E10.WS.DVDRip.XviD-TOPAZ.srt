- <i>[Miss Parker] Lights are on.</i>
<i>Somebody's home.</i>

4
00:00:18,168 --> 00:00:21,228
- Willie, go get him.
- My pleasure.

5

Jarod! Freeze!

6
00:00:36,419 --> 00:00:39,547
- [Grunts]

Jarod. Yeah, he's the, uh...

scientist who used to work here.

15
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:04,740
- "Used to."
- Yeah. Like I told the other guy
that was looking for him...

16

- he's gone.
- Someone else is looking forJarod?

17
00:01:08,518 --> 00:01:12,284
Yeah. The blind guy-
kind of Chinese-looking.

18

Ah.

45
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:10,167
Jarod helped me after I lost
my sight in a terrorist bombing.

46
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,435
He's helped lots of people
who have been victimized.

47
00:03:12,508 --> 00:03:15,341
<i>He taught me to see again...</i>

48

<i>so to speak.</i>

49
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:21,506
Why do you want
to know aboutJarod?

50
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:25,111
I have reason to believe
that he is in trouble.

51
00:03:25,188 --> 00:03:28,885
- I need you to help him.
- How can <i>I help?

52
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,390
I'm sure you realize...

53
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,430
that the loss of vision...

54
00:03:34,497 --> 00:03:37,728
often nurtures deeper insight.

55
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,133
And you feel
I've developed this insight?

56
00:03:41,204 --> 00:03:45,265
But of course.
That is why I brought you here.

57
00:03:45,341 --> 00:03:48,071
<i>Please, tell me howJarod...</i>

58
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:51,375
helped you and affected your life.

59
00:03:53,049 --> 00:03:55,984
I metJarod
while I was still in therapy...

60
00:03:56,052 --> 00:03:58,350
not long after the bombing.

61
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:02,949
I was... drawn to him
right from the start.

62
00:04:03,026 --> 00:04:07,326
It was like he felt my pain,
my fears.

63
00:04:07,397 --> 00:04:10,059
<i>[Rachel's Voice]</i>
<i>Six... seven...</i>

00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:15,093
- You can stop counting. You're here.
- Oh.

66
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,503
- [Chuckling]
- You must have stepped into the room.

67
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:21,270
- It's 11 steps to the door.
- I did. That's very good.

68
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:24,438
- It's a beautiful day. Why don't we go outside?
- Oh, no.

69
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,244
L-l- I think
I'd rather stay here.

70
00:04:27,317 --> 00:04:29,251
Rachel.

71
00:04:30,987 --> 00:04:33,319
You have
to go outside sometime.

72
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,187
I was supposed to work
in my studio...

73
00:04:36,259 --> 00:04:40,389
but it was such a nice day,
I decided to go on the rooftop of city hall.

74
00:04:40,463 --> 00:04:43,023
That's what happened
the last time I went outside.

75
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,829
You were in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

76
00:04:45,902 --> 00:04:47,995
That is not your fault.

77
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:50,699
You can't stop living
your life because of it.

78
00:04:52,108 --> 00:04:54,804
You know, when I had my eyes
behind the camera...

79
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,004
I could see things
no one else could see.

80
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,107
<i>I can remember details</i>
<i>of nearly every picture I ever took.</i>

81
00:05:01,184 --> 00:05:05,780
<i>That's ironic.</i>
<i>They tell me he was there that day.</i>

82
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:10,053
I must have seen the man who did this
to me as he was setting his bomb.

83
00:05:10,126 --> 00:05:14,859
<i>But as hard as I try,</i>
<i>I can't remember.</i>

84
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,297
So, are you saying that...

85
00:05:22,372 --> 00:05:25,239
Jarod connected with you
emotionally?

86
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:29,142
Oh, it was more than that.
It was almost like he became me.

87
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:32,477
<i>He seemed to know me,</i>
<i>understand me...</i>

88
00:05:32,548 --> 00:05:35,039
more than I knew myself.

89
00:05:35,118 --> 00:05:39,350
The way he enabled me
to face my life again was magical...

90
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,118
like an artist
painting a picture, only...

91
00:05:42,191 --> 00:05:45,388
Jarod was the painter,
and I was the canvas.

92
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:48,794
- <i>[Rachel] Is this some kind of new therapy?</i>
- <i>[Jarod] Call it a simulation.</i>

93
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:51,561
I'm going to create
an environment...

94
00:05:51,634 --> 00:05:55,661
with all the stimuli
you need to recreate an event.

95
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,240
- And for you to become someone.
- Who do you want me to become?

96
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:09,140
- Yourself.
- [Gasps]

97
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:11,778
Oh, my camera.

98
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:14,414
Oh, I haven't touched
this since the-

99
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,482
well, since the day at city hall.

100
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,393
<i>Now, I want you</i>
<i>to develop that roll of film-</i>

- <i>the pictures you took that day.</i>

102

- Oh, but there's no film in it.
- <i>I know.</i>

103

I want you to develop
the pictures in your mind.

104
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,342
I'm on the rooftop
at city hall.

105

<i>is at its perfect angle.</i>

106

107
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:46,986
<i>and I'm getting last minute shots</i>
<i>for my gallery opening.</i>

108
00:06:47,056 --> 00:06:50,890
- <i>[Jarod] Are you alone?</i>
- I think- I don't see anyone.

109
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,263
I don't-
I don't see anyone...

110
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,095
but l- I feel a-

111
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,499
<i>tingle on the back of my neck.</i>

112
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,870
- <i>Go on.</i>
- <i>I don't see anyone, but I hear something.</i>

113
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:08,934
- <i>What do you hear?</i>
- <i>Footsteps walking... quickly away.</i>

114
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,411
<i>It's right before it happens.</i>

115
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:19,783
<i>Rachel, do you see the bomb?</i>

116
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,120
It's only an instant
before the flash.

117
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,027
- <i>Do you see him?</i>
- No.

118
00:07:28,097 --> 00:07:30,691
<i>But I smell something.</i>

119
00:07:30,766 --> 00:07:32,700
- <i>I smell-</i>
- You smell him.

120
00:07:32,768 --> 00:07:35,396
It must be-
It's cologne.

121
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:37,496
Thank you.

122
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:41,304
Because of what he found
in my mind...

123
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:44,642
Jarod was able
to catch the bomber...

124
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:48,775
and help me find the courage
to believe in myself again.

125
00:07:48,851 --> 00:07:52,014

You know, you were right
about insight, Mr. Lee.

129
00:08:09,805 --> 00:08:12,171

<i>But you won't succeed.</i>

131

<i>Who the hell is Mr. Lee?</i>

What does a blind Chinese man

134
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:31,588
The same thing anyone else would-
an advantage.

135
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:34,425
Jarod's a very valuable commodity.
Question is...

136
00:08:34,497 --> 00:08:37,796
- who wants to trade in him?
- None of this makes any sense.

137
00:08:37,867 --> 00:08:41,268
<i>Broots, go back toJarod's last lair.</i>
<i>Check the neighborhood...</i>

- Okay.

- Oh, this isn't a prank.

You took an innocent

<i>Well, it didn't work, did it?</i>
<i>And someone did miss him- Enrique.</i>

212

485
00:29:29,884 --> 00:29:32,614
why he runs...

486
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,417
but does not vanish.

487
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:39,483
Well, why do you think
I can help you?

488
00:29:39,561 --> 00:29:42,758
<i>Coochie, coochie, coochie, coochie.
[Laughs]

489
00:29:42,831 --> 00:29:47,791
Because you have a very
unique relationship with Jarod.

490
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,396
You did try to kill him,
did you not?

491
00:29:53,174 --> 00:29:55,335
All in the interest of science.

492

493
00:30:01,516 --> 00:30:03,541
<i>Clear!</i>

494
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:07,689
- It really wasn't my idea anyway.

496
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:12,656
I believe you also
kidnapped Jarod. Huh?

497
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,958
Desperate times

"Desperate times call
for desperate measures," Anna.

499
00:30:20,435 --> 00:30:23,927
So, you weren't content
just to kidnapJarod, were you?

500
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:29,944
You also have to shoot
his brother and kill him.

501
00:30:30,011 --> 00:30:32,673
That was an accident,
pure and simple.

502
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:36,444
This is beautiful!
It's just one big happy family, isn't it?

503
00:30:36,518 --> 00:30:38,713
It's the end
of the line, Lyle.

504
00:30:38,786 --> 00:30:41,152
There's no place
left for you to run.

505
00:30:41,222 --> 00:30:45,181
I'm disappointed in you, Jarod. You know
me better than that. Drop the cannon, kid.

506
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,228
- Shoot him, you moron!
- Shut up!

that's all
you've ever offered us.

510
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,865
You stole our lives,
and you killed our spirit...

511
00:30:59,941 --> 00:31:02,000
<i>and now you think you can</i>
<i>threaten us with death?</i>

512
00:31:02,076 --> 00:31:06,570
It doesn't matter, Lyle.
Because we never made a difference anyway.

513
00:31:06,648 --> 00:31:09,811
I'll kill him.
I swear I will.

514
00:31:09,884 --> 00:31:12,444
And then I'll kill you.

515
00:31:13,988 --> 00:31:16,718
Don't do this,

There's another part
about what drives Jarod that l-l-

00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,412
I don't understand.

521
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,574
- And that is?
- [Chuckles]

522
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:46,017
Why, after all
you've done to him...

523
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:48,021
he has not killed you.

524
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,217
After all...

525
00:31:51,292 --> 00:31:55,820
he is more resourceful
and intelligent than you are.

526
00:31:58,766 --> 00:32:00,700
Maybe he just likes me.

527
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,202
Not.
[Chuckles]

528
00:32:04,806 --> 00:32:09,709
Shall we start from the beginning,
all over again, huh?

529

- <i>[Sydney] I don't know...</i>

530

<i>disturbed over the revelation...</i>

00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:18,416
that Mr. Lee is in contact
with your father's office.

532
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:20,420
Well, we're not
waiting any longer.

533
00:32:20,488 --> 00:32:23,218
- Let's go ahead and talk to this guy.
- Hmm.

534
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:32,189
- Hi.
- Hi.

535
00:32:32,266 --> 00:32:35,064
Hi,J.R.
My name is Sydney. This is Miss Parker.

536
00:32:35,136 --> 00:32:39,505
<i>Miss Parker?</i>
<i>You sure look familiar.</i>

537
00:32:39,574 --> 00:32:42,975
I have one of those faces.
Listen,J. <i>R...</i>

538
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:47,674
it's very important that you tell us exactly
what Mr. Lee wanted to know aboutJarod.

539
00:32:47,749 --> 00:32:50,081
Is Jarod
in some kind of trouble?

540
00:32:50,151 --> 00:32:54,451
- He might be.
- I'll do anything to help him.

541
00:32:54,522 --> 00:32:57,013
He saved my life twice.

542
00:32:57,091 --> 00:32:59,491
Once before I even met him.

543
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,688
J. R? Honey?
Sweetie, can you hear me? J. R?

544
00:33:02,764 --> 00:33:05,358
- [Jarod] He's in shock.
- Wake up.

545
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:08,095
- He's still breathing.
- <i>[Mother] He's hypoglycemic.</i>

546
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:12,265
- When was the last time he ate?
- He had cereal for breakfast three, four hours ago.

547
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,638
J. R? Come on, honey.

548
00:33:14,709 --> 00:33:16,973
What do you think
you're doing?

549
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:19,946
I need to stabilize his blood sugar.
Stick this in your mouth.

550
00:33:20,014 --> 00:33:22,915
I want you to let it dissolve, okay?
Good boy.

551
00:33:28,523 --> 00:33:31,686
- Mom?
- Oh! Oh!

552
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:35,490
It's okay, honey.
Everything's gonna be okay.

553
00:33:35,563 --> 00:33:40,057
<i>Mr. Lee seemed real interested</i>
<i>in the fact thatJarod knew I was sick.</i>

554
00:33:40,134 --> 00:33:43,467
- Your heart.
- <i>I needed a transplant.</i>

555
00:33:43,538 --> 00:33:47,565
My mom had pretty much
given up hope that I'd get one in time...

556
00:33:47,642 --> 00:33:49,735
untilJarod came into our lives.

557
00:33:49,811 --> 00:33:53,907
- How is he feeling?
- <i>[Mother] Better.</i>

558
00:33:53,981 --> 00:33:56,814
He has a heart condition.

559
00:33:56,884 --> 00:33:59,751
I noticed the bluish tint
to his fingertips and his lips.

560
00:33:59,821 --> 00:34:03,257
<i>I'd say by the looks of it,</i>
<i>you have a very sick boy.</i>

561
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:08,086
- Are you a doctor?
- Not at the moment.

562
00:34:09,564 --> 00:34:13,000
<i>Why hasn't he had</i>
<i>a heart transplant?</i>

563
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:18,202
Because he's on a waiting list.

564
00:34:18,272 --> 00:34:23,403
Because he has AB-negative blood,
which is very rare.

565
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:27,346
- It only happens in certain families.
- One in 300,000.

566
00:34:27,415 --> 00:34:31,613
<i>I know.</i>
<i>I have it too.</i>

567
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:38,353
You said Jarod
saved your life twice.

568
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:41,729
He found me a heart.

569
00:34:41,796 --> 00:34:44,697
You stay with me, little brother.
I'm gonna get you to a hospital.

570
00:34:44,766 --> 00:34:47,963
[Weakly]
It's too late, Jarod.

571
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:50,367
Don't you say that.

572
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:55,398
<i>Look at me!</i>
<i>Come on, just-just think-</i>

573
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:58,968
<i>Think about all the good times</i>
<i>we're gonna have together.</i>

574
00:34:59,046 --> 00:35:02,812
- I'm sorry, Jarod.
- For what?

575
00:35:02,884 --> 00:35:06,376
F-For everything.

576
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,391

577
00:35:16,397 --> 00:35:18,331

[Sobs]

579
00:35:41,255 --> 00:35:45,191
- Jarod gave you his brother's heart.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

580
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:47,420
And ever since
the transplant, he calls.

581
00:35:48,629 --> 00:35:50,597
<i>Notjust to check up on me...</i>

582
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:53,862
- but to see how I'm really doing.
- Mmm.

583
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:56,335
<i>Jarod's like the older brother</i>
<i>that I never had.</i>

584
00:35:58,339 --> 00:36:00,432
Mr. Lee seemed to think
that was real important.

585
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:08,504

592
00:36:31,072 --> 00:36:34,303
- to actually catch him?
- Unless we get there first.

[Clears Throat] About that phone call
from Lee to your father's office?

595
00:36:45,887 --> 00:36:49,015
- What about it?
- Well, it wasn't actually for Mr. Parker.

596
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,581
Well, did it go
to his office or didn't it?

597

Yes. Tech-
I mean, technically, yes.

598
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:56,825
- Technically?
- Well, there was a second phone line...

599
00:36:56,898 --> 00:36:59,162
recently installed
in your father's suite.

600
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:02,259
It seems now he's sharing
his office with someone else.

<i>And I traced the call</i>
<i>from Mr. Lee to that new line.</i>

And just whose new line
might that be, as if I didn't know?

603
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:12,609
- Brigitte.
- Well, why did I even ask?

604
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,342
Hold on, she's not there. I, uh-

I've been able
to understand how he thinks.

00:37:44,378 --> 00:37:48,781
And more importantly,
how he feels.

614

<i>We were able to break the code-</i>
<i>the pattern ofhis behavior.</i>

615
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:55,753
Jarod has a need to defend
those abused by power.

616
00:37:55,823 --> 00:38:00,522
Because of this need,
he's drawn to predictable situations.

617
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:03,324
- Such as?
- Those that are related...

618
00:38:03,397 --> 00:38:08,494
to the trauma of his childhood, and the guilt
he feels over the abuse of his work.

619

Thank you, Jarod.

648
00:39:39,193 --> 00:39:41,127
You're welcome.

Abner gets to come home
where he should have been all the time.

650
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:50,098
How can we ever repay you
for all you have done for us?

651
00:39:50,171 --> 00:39:52,662
- This is repayment enough.
- Oh.

652
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,731
Good luck, Abner.

655
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:09,353
Yes, Jarod has discovered
that many of the residents...

656
00:40:09,423 --> 00:40:12,984
have been intentionally
misdiagnosed.

They're trapped- prisoners in an
institution that denies them their freedom.

660
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:24,235
And Jarod's here to liberate them.
How noble.

I don't believe this!
