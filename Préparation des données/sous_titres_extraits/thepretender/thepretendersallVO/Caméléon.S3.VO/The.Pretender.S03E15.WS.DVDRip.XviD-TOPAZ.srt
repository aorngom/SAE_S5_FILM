I had seen Ted on a date
with another girl...

with someone like Luther...

Luther really was, I went back to Ted.

you were pregnant?

the truth?

Right now you're angry,
and you're hurt, and you're confused.

But if you leave that boy
without a father-

00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,757
if you walk away
from him now-
