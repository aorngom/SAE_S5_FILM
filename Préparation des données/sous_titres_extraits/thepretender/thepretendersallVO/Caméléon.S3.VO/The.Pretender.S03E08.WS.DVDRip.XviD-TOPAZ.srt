- I have his picture. Someone might have seen him.
- <i>[Phone Rings]</i>

164
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:48,852
Yeah?

165
00:11:48,924 --> 00:11:52,985
Sydney, we have to be patient.

166
00:11:54,597 --> 00:11:58,658
I have never been able
to help in his life, Michelle.

167
00:11:58,734 --> 00:12:02,693
Now when he needs me,
I'm just sitting here-

168
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:06,105
patiently!

169
00:12:06,175 --> 00:12:08,507
<i>Come on.
Take a walk with me.

170
00:12:08,577 --> 00:12:10,568
<i>Come on.

171
00:12:12,248 --> 00:12:14,773
I'm sorry, Michelle.

172
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:18,411
It's just this helplessness-

173
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,251
I know the feeling...

174
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:26,552
all too well.

175
00:12:26,629 --> 00:12:31,328
When Nicholas was born,
the doctors discovered a ventricular disorder.

176
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,996
They said that if it wasn't repaired immediately
that he was going to die.

177
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:39,234
He was only a few days old
when he had the operation.

178
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:43,574
It was a... five and a half-hour
open-heart surgery.

179
00:12:43,646 --> 00:12:46,945
I sat in the waiting room, all alone...

180
00:12:48,984 --> 00:12:52,078
trying to prepare myself
for the possibility...

181
00:12:52,154 --> 00:12:54,782
that my baby-

182
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,848
of my baby-

183
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:01,121
[Sighs]
Leaving me.

184
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:06,567
And now it's all coming back, that feeling
of having to prepare myself all over again.

185
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:09,604
You shouldn't have
gone through it alone.

186
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:11,765
You should have called me.

187
00:13:13,175 --> 00:13:15,643
Oh, Sydney.

188
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:19,977
I disappeared from your life because
the Centre threatened to kill you if I didn't.

189
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:23,678
It was hard enough
thinking of burying my child...

190
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:27,153
let alone the love of my life.

191
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:39,197
- I'm glad you called this time.
- So am I.

192
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,027

<i>Sir, pull over.</i>

207

<i>I'm afraid it's not good, Sydney.</i>

214
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,409
Uh, Eldridge Hailey started
the Appalachian Freedom Militia...

215
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,646
while serving 10 years
for voluntary manslaughter.

216
00:15:38,721 --> 00:15:42,623
His first act after his release
was a bombing that killed 12 people.

217
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,682
He got off on a technicality.

218
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:48,719
Ever since, it's been extortion,
murder, kidnapping-

219
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:51,766
- Sydney, what's going on down there?
- We're not even sure if he's-

220
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:55,167
Listen to me, Sydney.
You have to believe he's alive.

221
00:15:55,237 --> 00:15:57,967
You do whatever it takes
to bring your son home.

222
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,033
- Why are you doing this for me?
- Because you'd do the same.

226
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:21,493
It's about 12 miles southwest of here,
right in the heart of the national forest.

227
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:24,964
I suggest that we get within
a few miles on this fire road here...

228
00:16:25,034 --> 00:16:27,628
and then we proceed on foot
to avoid being detected.

229
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:29,898
Well, we've got
three hours until dawn.

Is that where they're holding my son?

<i>I'm not at liberty to discuss those types of specifics.</i>
<i>There are contingency plans-</i>

00:16:48,957 --> 00:16:51,949
- Why don't you tell us where he is?
- I'm doing everything l-

- I got the governor's publicity aide on line two.
- Not now.

- Not now!

<i>[Miss Parker] How will you know</i>
<i>where the kidnappers are, Sydney?</i>

245

<i>from the A. T.F. Office. It's a start.</i>

00:17:17,686 --> 00:17:20,246
<i>Parker, I need you</i>
<i>to do something for me.</i>

247
00:17:20,322 --> 00:17:23,382
- What?
- Hailey is demanding a million-dollars' ransom.

248
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,691
Liquidate my assets and wire it
into a designated bank account.

249
00:17:27,763 --> 00:17:30,664
<i>It probably won't be enough,</i>
<i>but maybe he'll take it.</i>

250
00:17:30,733 --> 00:17:34,225
No. Syd, I got a better idea.

251
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,295
- Let the Centre pick up the tab on this one.
- The Centre?

252
00:17:37,372 --> 00:17:39,670
Well, they're responsible
for you not knowing Nicholas.

253
00:17:39,742 --> 00:17:42,040
The least they can do
is pay to get him back.

254
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,375
<i>You think Hailey will keep up</i>
<i>his end of the deal?</i>

255
00:17:44,446 --> 00:17:47,506
I'm going to find him
and make sure he does.

256
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:50,984
Sydney, you don't want
to take this man on by yourself.

257
00:17:51,053 --> 00:17:55,080
I have spent my whole life standing by
while other people did their jobs-

258
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:59,719
<i>no matter who it hurt-</i>
<i>without protecting those who needed my help.</i>

259
00:17:59,795 --> 00:18:01,786
Not this time, Parker.

260
00:18:01,864 --> 00:18:04,662
We need to go there.

261
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:07,827
Miss Parker, Sydney asked us
to stay out of it.

262
00:18:07,903 --> 00:18:12,636
I understand a parent's need to do
whatever it takes to ensure their child's safety.

263
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:17,008
- But how does Sydney getting
himself killed accomplish that?
- Well, maybe he's not alone.

264
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,673
- Maybe Sydney has help.
- Jarod.

265
00:18:19,748 --> 00:18:23,149
Why do you say that?

266
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:27,450
Well, before Sydney left,
he-he was at his keyboard.

267
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:29,514
E-mail toJarod?

268
00:18:29,591 --> 00:18:32,025
Find out.

269
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,100
Kerosene lamps burning in that mine.

270
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:53,012
They could be anywhere around here.
Recon the area and surround the mine head.

271
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:14,827

Okay, go! Go!

282
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,916

Three of Hailey's militia men.

a half a dozen rounds.

And the... hostages?

290
00:20:53,035 --> 00:20:56,903

You called him Sydney.
How did you know his name?

He's the father of one of the hostages.

- No.
- Huh.

- Executed them.

335
00:23:21,049 --> 00:23:23,540

He took 'em west.

no other access-

395
00:28:14,342 --> 00:28:17,175

Your son is a good man.

414

- Was it your father's?
- It was his grandfather's.

like a piece of his past.

You wanted to kill me.

491
00:35:56,671 --> 00:35:58,832
Kyle just got in the way.

492
00:36:00,808 --> 00:36:03,106
I told you once:

493
00:36:03,177 --> 00:36:08,137
We can do great things together.
That offer's still on the table.

494
00:36:08,216 --> 00:36:10,548
You think you can bribe me?

495
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:13,814
Jarod, it's not a bribe.

496
00:36:13,888 --> 00:36:19,326
Mr. Lyle, do you want your last breath
on this planet to be a lie?

497
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,261
Now step to the center of the room.

498
00:36:36,244 --> 00:36:38,576
Now turn around.

499
00:36:38,646 --> 00:36:41,114
Turn... around.

500
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:52,525
- Drop to your knees.
- Please, Jarod-

501
00:36:52,593 --> 00:36:55,528
On your knees!

502
00:36:55,596 --> 00:37:01,364
So is this how it's gonna be?
An execution without a trial?

503
00:37:01,435 --> 00:37:04,063
- You didn't give my brother a trial.
- I didn't-

504
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:06,800
- It was self-defense.
- So is this.

505
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:10,903
Jarod, I know things.

506
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,545
There are things I can tell you...
about your family...

507
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:18,915

<i>things no one else knows.</i>

No, Jarod.

Miss Parker.

521
00:38:21,682 --> 00:38:25,448
- You've been talking toJarod?
- He's here! He went out that door!

522
00:38:25,519 --> 00:38:27,510
What?

523
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,685
Well-

524
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:34,728
<i>Well, he's not here now.</i>

525
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:36,786
- Well, find him!
- Another day.

526
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:40,163
- What?
- Broots picked up a transmission
from an A.T.F. Unit flying in.

527
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,225
But he was right here!

528
00:38:44,972 --> 00:38:47,406
What did he do to you?

529
00:38:47,475 --> 00:38:51,571
Nothing. I had him,
and those idiots outside let him escape.

530
00:38:51,645 --> 00:38:54,910
Whatever you say, Lyle.
But now it's time to go.

531
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:57,951
No, we can't just go.

Listen to me.
When the A.T.F. Walks in...

533
00:39:00,654 --> 00:39:04,385
we don't have an explanation for anything
that's happened in the last two days.

534
00:39:04,458 --> 00:39:08,861
If we don't go now, the trail leads back to

No, Seth. He's not my friend.
