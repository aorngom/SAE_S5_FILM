- I've always been partial to Mu Shu.

<i>Corporate risk assessment.

- <i>And probably by the Africans.</i>
- Orlani.

386
00:22:51,969 --> 00:22:55,132
Faddis's minions must have planted it
on Argyle when they broke his finger.

<i>Yeah. He's out colder</i>

- You were right- too much knockout juice.
- He'll be fine.

389
00:23:00,511 --> 00:23:04,572
Not if he keeps up like this. A son
should never stop listening to his father.

390
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,083
He should know to stay away
from the wrong people.

391

My Adella would have
made sure of that.

392

- He was an only chid.
- Yep.

395
00:23:18,763 --> 00:23:22,756
After he was born, <i>Dr.</i> Canepa told Adella
she had to close down the baby foundry.

- Many molds.

When I lost her...

409
00:24:07,111 --> 00:24:09,636

- to a guy like Argyle?
- Oh, you know that little weasel?

<i>There is a room behind this wall.</i>

479
00:28:16,427 --> 00:28:18,361
And...

480
00:28:19,563 --> 00:28:21,554
<i>Iook what I found.</i>

481
00:28:24,301 --> 00:28:28,237
It was a studio or something.
The skylights back there are great.

482
00:28:28,305 --> 00:28:30,830
As soon as I lose this wall,
it'll really brighten up in here.

483
00:28:30,908 --> 00:28:32,842
Leave-Leave it up.

484
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:35,242
- Are you kidding me?
- Leave it up.

485
00:28:35,312 --> 00:28:38,110
I have to catch a flight
to Hawaii in an hour. Just-

486
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,584
<i>Cover it.

487
00:28:41,652 --> 00:28:43,950
You knew about the room.

488
00:28:44,021 --> 00:28:46,888
I saw your mother's name
on some stationery.

489
00:28:46,957 --> 00:28:49,926
<i>Catherine Parker.
It was her studio.

490
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:51,928
- You knew it was there all along.
- Yes, I did.

491
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:55,295
I'm the one who put the wall up,
so just leave it up.

492
00:28:55,366 --> 00:28:57,425
Parker, why didn't
you say something?

493
00:28:57,501 --> 00:29:00,993
What am I supposed to say?
[Exhales]

494
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,270
You want me to tell you that
that was her favorite room...

495
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:09,835
<i>and that's where she would read to me</i>
<i>and tell me stories and braid my hair?</i>

496
00:29:09,913 --> 00:29:13,610
Is that what I'm supposed to do-
just bare my soul to a stranger?

497
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:15,618
Oh.

498
00:29:16,653 --> 00:29:18,587
So, I'm a stranger.

499
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:20,782
I figured at least, uh,
acquaintance.

500
00:29:20,858 --> 00:29:22,883
[Hushed]
Well, you figured wrong.

501
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:29,625
- That what the gun's for, hmm?
- [Exhales]

502
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,793
To keep strangers away?

503
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:35,270
I'm guessing your life's filled with them-
starting with her.

504
00:29:47,851 --> 00:29:50,445
Put the wall back up
while I'm gone.

505
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,785
Sure thing.

506
00:29:53,857 --> 00:29:57,691
I'll be back Saturday...
to give you the check.

507
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:00,863

508
00:30:00,863 --> 00:30:01,852

509
00:30:09,071 --> 00:30:11,062
<i>I let him go.</i>

510
00:30:12,774 --> 00:30:16,403
He stood there waiting...
for me to stop him...

511
00:30:16,478 --> 00:30:18,503
and I let him go.

512
00:30:21,149 --> 00:30:23,276
Your fix-it man is right, Parker.

513
00:30:25,721 --> 00:30:27,655
Why is everyone a stranger?

514
00:30:33,195 --> 00:30:35,993
<i>Aw, nuts!</i>
<i>We're up to our necks in it now, Pop.</i>

515
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:38,430
Look, Faddis, that fungus,
has been in the rackets...

516
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,434
since before you two were born.

517
00:30:40,502 --> 00:30:42,436
Understand something, Benny.

518
00:30:42,504 --> 00:30:44,904
Faddis is a killer, and he won't stop
until he finds both of you.

519
00:30:44,973 --> 00:30:47,806
And who's a fungus now, Pop?
You lied toJarod about the key.

520
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:50,310
You want him to fight
your battles for you? Is that it?

521
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:54,145
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Nobody fights my battles for me.
- Oh, yeah?

522
00:30:54,216 --> 00:30:56,810
Yeah, and not everybody was so lucky
they got to go to World War II.

523
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:59,820
- <i>I was serving my country-</i>
- Okay. Okay. Enough!

524
00:31:01,223 --> 00:31:04,192
<i>Look, your father</i>
<i>only lied about the key...</i>

525
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:06,591
because he was trying
to get Faddis off your back.

526
00:31:06,662 --> 00:31:09,597
- You were?
- [Murmurs]

527
00:31:09,665 --> 00:31:11,656
Your son borrowed the money
from Faddis...

528
00:31:11,733 --> 00:31:15,294
so he could surprise you
with a trip to the Vatican.

529
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:18,430
You mean... see the big guy?

530
00:31:18,507 --> 00:31:21,840
Yeah, Pop. If you just stick
with me and Jarod, you know?

531
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:24,401
We wanna get you there
so you can see the guy, you know?

532
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:27,004
Be-Before you die and all.

533
00:31:29,785 --> 00:31:31,776
<i>Isn't there something</i>

- <i>Benny.</i>
- Hmm?

536
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:44,965
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>a brain condition, do you?</i>

537
00:31:48,003 --> 00:31:51,530
And this medication-

538
00:31:51,606 --> 00:31:54,803
[Crunching]
Mmm. Sugar pills.

539
00:31:56,345 --> 00:31:59,542
You mean,
y-you're not dyin', Pop?

540
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:04,983
I've got a great idea here.
Why don't we try a little fact...

541
00:32:05,053 --> 00:32:07,647
instead of fiction, huh?

542
00:32:07,723 --> 00:32:09,987
<i>[Narrating] It was the first time</i>
<i>both of them had shut up...</i>

543
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:13,323
<i>since I'd gotten there,</i>
<i>and I knew where the silence came from.</i>

544
00:32:13,395 --> 00:32:17,161
<i>There was a time when it would have</i>
<i>been filled with another voice.</i>

545
00:32:17,232 --> 00:32:20,065
She's gone.
She can't be replaced.

546
00:32:20,135 --> 00:32:22,103
<i>That's not an option with mothers.</i>

547
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:25,367
But, you two, you don't
have to lose each other.

548
00:32:26,375 --> 00:32:28,138
Hmm.

549
00:32:40,022 --> 00:32:43,253
<i>It was the kind of moment</i>
<i>I left the Centre for.</i>

550
00:32:43,325 --> 00:32:45,259
<i>Of course, helping</i>
<i>Argyle's father meant nothing...</i>

551
00:32:45,327 --> 00:32:47,261
<i>if Argyle didn't</i>
<i>live through the week.</i>

552
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:52,296
<i>That's where the cigar box came in.</i>

553

[Whimpers]

554
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,934
<i>Argyle thought he had</i>
<i>everything figured out.</i>

555
00:32:58,006 --> 00:33:01,032
Hey, hey. Yo, I got
this thing nailed, J-man.

556
00:33:01,109 --> 00:33:04,704
See, I'm thinkin'
this guy's the Cuban, right?

557
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,975
So he's gotta have
family on the island...

558
00:33:07,049 --> 00:33:10,644
under the yoke of the evil dictator
Fidel Castro and whatnot.

559
00:33:10,719 --> 00:33:12,880
<i>But, of course, Argyle was way off.</i>

560
00:33:12,954 --> 00:33:16,913
<i>Faddis had killed two of the Cuban's</i>
<i>couriers and stolen his money...</i>

561
00:33:16,992 --> 00:33:19,790
<i>and he needed someone</i>
<i>to blame it on-Argyle.</i>

562
00:33:19,861 --> 00:33:23,194
<i>The contents of the cigar box</i>
<i>fingered Argyle as a criminal nicknamed-</i>

00:33:23,265 --> 00:33:25,563
LittleJoe from Chicago.

564
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:29,798
<i>You see, the Cuban was supposed</i>
<i>to find Argyle at the Dumpster and kill him.</i>

565
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:32,533
<i>He'd find the key, the cigar box</i>
<i>and have his culprit.</i>

566
00:33:32,607 --> 00:33:35,303
- <i>And Faddis would get away with murder...</i>
- [Rattling On, Indistinct]

567
00:33:35,377 --> 00:33:39,404
- <i>and a lot of the Cuban's money.</i>

Hmm? Hmm? Am I good?

572
00:33:48,723 --> 00:33:50,748
You nailed it, Argyle.

573
00:33:50,826 --> 00:33:54,626
<i>Just one question-</i>
<i>Where were the Cuban's couriers?</i>

574
00:33:54,696 --> 00:33:56,459
You're gonna go
for a long walk off a short pier.

575
00:33:56,531 --> 00:33:59,261
<i>Cliché, I know,</i>
<i>but I happen to own the pier.</i>

576
00:33:59,334 --> 00:34:02,701
<i>Faddis had covered the Cuban's couriers</i>
<i>in chains and tossed them.</i>

577
00:34:02,771 --> 00:34:06,172
<i>It was a cliché- the worst kind.</i>

578
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:10,770
<i>I was planning</i>
<i>a similar fate for Faddis.</i>

579

<i>payback against the people who think</i>
<i>they can step on the little guy.</i>

<i>In this case, one of</i>
<i>the littlest guys on the planet.</i>

00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:28,695
Oh. No, this ain't

584
00:34:28,763 --> 00:34:31,061
- This ain't what it looks like.
- What are you doin' with this?

585
00:34:32,601 --> 00:34:34,831
<i>I wasn't stealin'anything.</i>

586
00:34:34,903 --> 00:34:36,837
I was borrowing that...

587
00:34:39,107 --> 00:34:41,769
to make this.

588
00:34:43,945 --> 00:34:47,005
Lamina-pope gave me the idea.

589
00:34:47,082 --> 00:34:49,676
This way, she'll always be protected

<i>I wasn't pretending anymore.</i>

594
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:11,433
<i>I told Argyle to meet me</i>
<i>at the pier at 8.00.</i>

00:38:13,154 --> 00:38:15,145
<i>Neither were the police.</i>

640
00:38:15,223 --> 00:38:17,453
<i>I told them where they could find Faddis,</i>
<i>the Cuban's dead couriers...</i>

641
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:19,925
<i>and our videotape.</i>

642
00:38:21,229 --> 00:38:25,325
Nobody messes with the 'Gyle
and his sidekick, J-rod!

643
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,097
- [Dog Barks]
- Didn't anybody ever tell you crime don't pay?

644
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,161
We're a pretty good team,
you and me.

645
00:38:37,645 --> 00:38:39,943
- Thomas?
- <i>[Keys Clatter]</i>

646
00:38:49,591 --> 00:38:52,321
<i>You always this punctual?</i>

647
00:38:52,394 --> 00:38:55,124
The storm.
[Sighs]

648
00:38:55,196 --> 00:38:57,323
We had to circle and-

649
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:09,505
<i>I know you didn't ask for a door.</i>

650
00:39:13,214 --> 00:39:15,205
If you want, I can put
the wall back up.

651
00:39:24,325 --> 00:39:26,259
So, what's the damage?

652
00:39:26,327 --> 00:39:28,420
Same price. Nothing extra.

653
00:39:31,966 --> 00:39:35,925
It's locked now,
but if you want to open it...

654
00:39:36,004 --> 00:39:37,995
you got the option.

655
00:39:53,221 --> 00:39:55,155
Tommy.

656
00:39:57,959 --> 00:39:59,950
I shouldn't have lied.
It's just-

657
00:40:06,134 --> 00:40:10,195
I was... very young
when my mother died.

658
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,431
And after it happened, I just-

659
00:40:17,579 --> 00:40:20,343
My- l-

660
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:23,509
I just couldn't bring myself
to go into that room.

661
00:40:25,453 --> 00:40:27,785
[Sighs]

662
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:29,790
Mom and I used to-

663
00:40:31,693 --> 00:40:33,627
used to...

664
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:38,732
talk all night in there.

665
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,600
And moonlight made it so special.

666
00:40:46,608 --> 00:40:49,270
She had a very... painful life...

667
00:40:49,344 --> 00:40:52,802
and that room was her sanctuary.

668
00:40:52,881 --> 00:40:55,008
No, Parker.

669
00:41:00,822 --> 00:41:02,619
You were.

670
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,591
But you can't remember that.

671
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:08,925
When you closed off that room,
you closed off a part of your soul-

672
00:41:08,997 --> 00:41:13,866
the part that came from her.

673
00:41:13,935 --> 00:41:15,869
Get it back.

674
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,550
I can't do it alone.

675
00:41:59,147 --> 00:42:01,980
<i>Come on. It'll be okay.

676
00:42:12,327 --> 00:42:15,125
<i>[Key Turns In Lock]</i>

677
00:42:15,196 --> 00:42:18,359
<i>[Woman Vocalizing, Ethereal]</i>

678
00:42:44,892 --> 00:42:47,861
[Chattering]

679
00:42:47,929 --> 00:42:52,025
Your Holiness,
this is truly a great honor.

680
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,864
I only wish my Adella was here.

681
00:42:54,936 --> 00:43:00,101
But I guess she's watching
from up above. Huh?

682
00:43:00,174 --> 00:43:02,199
Nobody knows that
better than you, hey, big guy?

683
00:43:02,276 --> 00:43:04,210
You know, he's so, like, human.

684
00:43:04,278 --> 00:43:06,974
- I know. He ain't no lamina-pope.
- It's amazing.

685
00:43:07,048 --> 00:43:09,539
[Speaking Italian]

686
00:43:12,487 --> 00:43:14,478
Argyle will never forget this, baby.

687
00:43:23,364 --> 00:43:25,298
Your Highness, talk to me
about the gift shop.

688
00:43:25,366 --> 00:43:28,392
What's up with those people down there?
They don't have any manners?

689
00:43:28,469 --> 00:43:32,166
<i>They work for you?</i>
<i>Think you could kick us in a discount?</i>

690
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,640
<i>You ever think about getting</i>
<i>those prayer cards laminated?</i>

691
00:43:34,709 --> 00:43:36,700
<i>Hmm? Hmm? What you think?</i>
