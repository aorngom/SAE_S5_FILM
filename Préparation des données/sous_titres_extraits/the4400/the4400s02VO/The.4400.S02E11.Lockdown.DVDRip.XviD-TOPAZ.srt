1
00:00:46,518 --> 00:00:48,456
Previously on the 4400...

2
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,420
Kevin's a genius, you know,

3
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:51,775
but he doesn't brag about it.

4
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:57,027
Kevin, did you just speak to me?

5
00:00:57,062 --> 00:00:58,001
I haven't

6
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:01,160
said anything for a long time.

7
00:01:01,183 --> 00:01:02,367
Try six years.

8
00:01:02,402 --> 00:01:05,748
You're saying that Burkhoff
is the father of the 4400 technology.

9
00:01:05,772 --> 00:01:08,179
I can think again too.

10
00:01:08,296 --> 00:01:10,187
Kyle never came home last night.

11
00:01:10,207 --> 00:01:11,323
Kyle said he blacked out.

12
00:01:11,358 --> 00:01:14,716
You could've come to me, told me what was
going on. He's your cousin, your friend.

13
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:18,039
Kyle thinks he did something during one of
his blackouts. He seemed really freaked out about it.

14
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:23,390
If it happened during one of his blackouts,
he wouldn't need a reason.

15
00:01:23,414 --> 00:01:26,462
I don't remember them telling me
to turn my son into a murderer.

16
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,566
I kept hoping
I was wrong about it.

17
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:31,196
This is not Kyle's doing.
You've got to hold onto that.

18
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,006
Kyle...

19
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,990
you weren't in control
of your actions, Kyle.

20
00:01:34,014 --> 00:01:36,298
You did not kill Jordan Collier.

21
00:01:37,213 --> 00:01:39,292
Forget about the flight.
Bring Kyle home.

22
00:01:39,339 --> 00:01:41,534
They just arrested
a suspect in the Collier killing.

23
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,712
We caught that man, the one that
we were looking for. It's all over.

24
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,932
Not yet.

25
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:52,625
Thursday, July 28
5:37 pm

26
00:01:57,475 --> 00:01:58,297
Mommy,

27
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:00,680
I'm scared.

28
00:02:00,915 --> 00:02:02,148
I know, baby.

29
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:04,931
I'm scared too.

30
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,668
But it's going to be okay,

31
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:08,559
because mommy's here.

32
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,785
Okay?

33
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:20,552
Whatever's coming through that door...

34
00:02:24,168 --> 00:02:25,330
I'll protect you.

35
00:03:42,486 --> 00:03:44,669
Thursday, July 28
7:22 am
Ten Hours Earlier

36
00:04:01,974 --> 00:04:04,841
Today is Jordan Collier's Birthday

37
00:04:07,724 --> 00:04:09,391
He died on NTAC's watch

38
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:12,148
What does that mean?

39
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:13,521
What's what means?

40
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:15,635
Nothing.
Just some crank...

41
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,373
it's nothing.

42
00:04:17,619 --> 00:04:19,815
Guess it's Jordan Collier's birthday.

43
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:23,076
The state of Washington gave him
a birthday present. Did you read this?

44
00:04:23,117 --> 00:04:24,866
They're talking like
it's an open-and-shut case.

45
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:28,342
He made threats against Collier.
Two witnesses picked him out of a lineup.

46
00:04:28,377 --> 00:04:30,890
But they're wrong.
Roy Marsden didn't kill Jordan Collier.

47
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:32,183
And neither did you, Kyle.

48
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:34,720
You told me he'd never see a courtroom.
They want to execute this guy.

49
00:04:34,755 --> 00:04:39,103
It's not going to happen, Kyle.
No one can put him up on that roof. Any...

50
00:04:39,126 --> 00:04:43,306
any public defender will have a motion to dismiss
in front of a judge by this time next week.

51
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,206
What if you're wrong? What if they find him guilty?
What am I supposed to do? Nothing?

52
00:04:46,241 --> 00:04:50,641
Marsden has been in and out of jail since
he was 15. Theft, assault, attempted rape...

53
00:04:50,676 --> 00:04:51,827
but he didn't kill anybody.

54
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:54,762
And he's not going to be convicted of it, Kyle.
I'm not going to let it happen.

55
00:04:54,797 --> 00:04:56,053
Neither will I.

56
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,231
Kyle, it's not going to be easy, but you're going
to have to start putting all this behind you.

57
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:07,250
It's your first day back at school,

58
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:08,705
and I want you focused

59
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,196
and fierce,

60
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:12,310
and thinking about As.

61
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:16,067
Okay.

62
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:17,640
Okay.

63
00:05:18,967 --> 00:05:19,836
All right.

64
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:29,158
Sweetie...

65
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:32,716
Mrs. Benke's going to be here
any minute. It's time to get up.

66
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,743
I don't feel good.

67
00:05:37,974 --> 00:05:40,392
You've got a real fever, young lady.

68
00:05:46,005 --> 00:05:46,633
Hey,

69
00:05:47,655 --> 00:05:49,111
how long have you had that?

70
00:05:51,694 --> 00:05:55,169
Dishonest? No, no, no.
I don't think we're being dishonest at all.

71
00:05:55,716 --> 00:05:59,262
Human beings use less than
20% of their brain capacity.

72
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:01,082
Everything else is just...

73
00:06:01,153 --> 00:06:03,957
collecting cobwebs.
Here at the 4400 center,

74
00:06:03,992 --> 00:06:05,838
we're trying to tap into
that unused potential.

75
00:06:05,871 --> 00:06:09,781
So your own ability, you believe it
stems from increased brainpower?

76
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:11,589
Show me another explanation.

77
00:06:11,612 --> 00:06:15,309
Look, whether you believe that
we were taken to the future or not,

78
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:18,761
somebody did change us,
and they used technology to do it.

79
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:21,227
We're just trying to figure out
how and share it.

80
00:06:21,262 --> 00:06:25,623
But "first keys", "second keys",
"unlocking the ability inside you"...

81
00:06:25,662 --> 00:06:29,402
you have to admit that the terminology
is more religious than scientific.

82
00:06:29,449 --> 00:06:32,185
Well, the movement
is part faith, part science.

83
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:33,893
It's a potent combination.

84
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:47,258
So what time was
your appointment for?

85
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:50,484
They told me 11:15...

86
00:06:50,508 --> 00:06:53,161
but they always tell me 11:15.

87
00:06:53,901 --> 00:06:56,378
I never get in before 12:00, 12:30.

88
00:06:56,798 --> 00:06:59,659
Hey, free health care, right?
So what if they're so slow?

89
00:06:59,773 --> 00:07:01,718
Compulsory free health care.

90
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:05,910
You don't show up for a quarterly checkup,
you've got the goon squad knocking at your door.

91
00:07:05,945 --> 00:07:07,120
You don't like it?

92
00:07:07,296 --> 00:07:08,376
Don't show.

93
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:11,476
Doubt they'd slap the cuffs
on someone's grandma.

94
00:07:15,715 --> 00:07:16,971
Does it itch at all?

95
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:18,758
Here.

96
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:21,581
103.1.

97
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:23,208
No wonder you wanted
to stay in bed.

98
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,268
Is it some kind of flu?

99
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:27,059
Most likely.

100
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:29,618
Is it okay if we keep her
here for a few hours?

101
00:07:29,654 --> 00:07:31,004
I want to go home.

102
00:07:31,027 --> 00:07:34,761
I know you do, honey, but dr. Hudson
is going to take very good care of you,

103
00:07:34,796 --> 00:07:37,180
and I'll look in on you as often as I can.

104
00:07:37,227 --> 00:07:39,159
I wish I brought Lemon.

105
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,578
That's her stuffed dog.

106
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:43,809
Let me guess.
He's yellow.

107
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,992
Yeah. Well, I could go
back and get him.

108
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:48,918
You have a very nice mommy.

109
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:51,008
I try.

110
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,063
About this rash...

111
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:57,532
... now, I worked at the C.D.C. for seven years,
and I never saw anything like it.

112
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:59,082
It's kind of a weird shape, huh?

113
00:07:59,117 --> 00:07:59,727
Yeah.

114
00:07:59,751 --> 00:08:02,064
Don't read too much into it.
It could still be

115
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:04,682
hives... an allergic reaction.
We'll take care of it.

116
00:08:06,892 --> 00:08:08,947
Sweetie, you'll be okay here...

117
00:08:08,982 --> 00:08:10,145
... if I go get Lemon?

118
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,012
Okay, my darling.

119
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,196
Bye, darling.

120
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:19,292
When daddy's away, he misses Isabelle so much.
But traveling around the country,

121
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:23,443
talking to all sorts of people,
clueing them in about my life...

122
00:08:23,736 --> 00:08:25,427
it's kind of fun.

123
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:30,632
Shawn's amazing.

124
00:08:31,243 --> 00:08:32,664
This woman comes in.

125
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:35,822
Her C.A.T. scan says she's got
a brain tumor the size of a walnut.

126
00:08:35,846 --> 00:08:38,502
20 minutes later, she's on
her way. Good as new.

127
00:08:38,571 --> 00:08:39,267
Hmm.

128
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,070
I'll feed her.

129
00:08:41,105 --> 00:08:42,631
She's not hungry yet.

130
00:08:43,207 --> 00:08:44,254
How do you know?

131
00:08:44,301 --> 00:08:46,145
She told me before you came in.

132
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:47,671
So she's...

133
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:49,491
... talking to me.

134
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:52,685
Communicating.
Same as she does with you.

135
00:08:53,225 --> 00:08:55,337
- Since when?
- This morning.

136
00:09:00,327 --> 00:09:03,098
I thought you'd be happy.
First time she ever said anything to me.

137
00:09:03,145 --> 00:09:05,012
That's great.
It's just...

138
00:09:06,609 --> 00:09:08,628
she hasn't said anything
to me for weeks.

139
00:09:08,663 --> 00:09:11,446
I wouldn't worry about it.
It's just how you used to tell me...

140
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:14,950
kids always alternate
between parents. It's normal...

141
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:19,318
Just with Isabelle,
it comes with a twist.

142
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:30,396
This is major Charles Culp of the National
Security Agency's field enforcement división.

143
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,252
D.C. has loaned us his services.

144
00:09:32,312 --> 00:09:35,194
Effective immediately, the major
and his team will be providing backup

145
00:09:35,252 --> 00:09:38,793
in any 4400 cases
requiring armed intervention.

146
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:43,262
We know this office bears
a heavy caseload,

147
00:09:43,485 --> 00:09:45,152
and we're here to help when needed.

148
00:09:45,176 --> 00:09:46,444
Welcome aboard.

149
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:49,602
Hope you guys are up to it, 'cause
I'm going to have you on speed dial.

150
00:09:49,638 --> 00:09:52,421
We'll stay out of your way,
let you do your jobs.

151
00:09:52,444 --> 00:09:53,853
When the time comes,

152
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,685
we hope you'll return the favor.

153
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:00,306
Well, the last lady that we went up against
released poison spores from her palms, so, uh...

154
00:10:00,341 --> 00:10:02,431
if you want to track her
down instead of me...

155
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:03,711
by all means.

156
00:10:03,746 --> 00:10:06,376
My men and I are used to
unique challenges.

157
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:09,312
How long have we been asking
for tactical support?

158
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:10,296
Eight months.

159
00:10:10,331 --> 00:10:12,187
I guess someone up
there likes us.

160
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:14,206
You guys check your emails
this morning?

161
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,801
"Happy birthday, Jordan Collier"?

162
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:19,220
Everyone in the building
got that one.

163
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:22,321
Maybe Marco should have one
of his guys try to backtrack it.

164
00:10:22,474 --> 00:10:27,276
They already did. It came from
a public terminal in an internet cafe.

165
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,096
It was a new email account.

166
00:10:29,645 --> 00:10:32,216
Nice to know
Collier's still got his fans.

167
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:35,539
What's that?

168
00:10:36,326 --> 00:10:38,566
It's Valerian root or...

169
00:10:38,601 --> 00:10:41,795
... something. I don't know, Alana swears by it.
They calm me down a little.

170
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,990
My suggestion?
Double your dosage.

171
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:46,231
The Baldwin trigger has been
a little "hair" lately.

172
00:10:46,266 --> 00:10:47,851
My girlfriend agrees with you.

173
00:10:47,886 --> 00:10:50,070
I need you to cover me
for an hour.

174
00:10:50,481 --> 00:10:54,121
Maia's got the flu or something, and
Hudson wants her to spend the day here.

175
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:55,020
She okay?

176
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:56,170
I'm sure it's nothing.

177
00:10:56,194 --> 00:11:00,961
I mean, I was sure that it was the bubonic plague,
but her doctor tells me that it's nothing.

178
00:11:01,924 --> 00:11:04,612
So you plowed into some guy
and got away with it?

179
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,896
That's kind of a weird way to put it.

180
00:11:07,542 --> 00:11:10,407
Well, the perks of having
a dad at NTAC, I guess.

181
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:12,920
And this guy you hit,
how messed up was he?

182
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:15,444
I can't really talk about it.
You know, it's lawyer stuff.

183
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:17,078
Who am I going to tell?

184
00:11:19,685 --> 00:11:21,939
I broke both his legs
and his collarbone.

185
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:23,489
That's it?

186
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,897
He was in a car, Danny.
It's not like I mowed over a pedestrian.

187
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:30,901
Yeah, but you kept talking about this "awful thing"
you did. I thought you killed somebody.

188
00:11:31,476 --> 00:11:32,227
What?

189
00:11:32,861 --> 00:11:34,353
Well, thanks a lot, man.

190
00:11:34,382 --> 00:11:35,591
So did Shawn.

191
00:11:35,627 --> 00:11:37,740
Well, sorry to disappoint you guys.

192
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:40,662
Well, look, do me a favor, okay?

193
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:43,398
If you get in trouble again,
tell somebody.

194
00:11:43,891 --> 00:11:46,979
There's nothing you can tell me
or Shawn that we can't handle.

195
00:11:47,131 --> 00:11:50,046
Next time I black out and have a car accident,
you'll be the first to know.

196
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:52,758
Yeah, long as I'm not riding shotgun.

197
00:11:54,613 --> 00:11:57,971
Oh, hey, listen, you want to go see
Arcade Fire with me on friday night, or

198
00:11:58,016 --> 00:12:00,423
do you have to stay home
and nurse your guilty conscience?

199
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,656
No nursing. I'll go.

200
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,431
- Yeah?
- I'll go.

201
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:03,441
- All right.
- Yeah.

202
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:05,272
It's good to have you back.

203
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:06,824
Good to be back.

204
00:12:08,033 --> 00:12:08,937
I got to go.

205
00:12:09,818 --> 00:12:11,015
Okay. See you.

206
00:12:38,687 --> 00:12:39,638
You hear that?

207
00:12:40,906 --> 00:12:41,869
That buzz?

208
00:12:45,626 --> 00:12:46,507
What is it?

209
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,444
What?

210
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,037
Is that coming from your gadget?

211
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,362
Is what coming from my gadget?

212
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,641
That noise.

213
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:57,072
I don't hear anything.

214
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,657
Neither do I.

215
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:28,421
What is that noise?

216
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:30,352
You hear that?

217
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,581
What's going on?

218
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:35,976
I've got, like, a headache.

219
00:13:42,178 --> 00:13:43,878
Did you hear that?

220
00:13:44,394 --> 00:13:45,877
A gift from me to you

221
00:13:49,016 --> 00:13:50,098
Have fun trying to survive the day

222
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:53,410
Why is my signature
on this requisition?

223
00:13:53,444 --> 00:13:55,427
Because I had to get it in!

224
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,079
Do not sign my name
on another report.

225
00:13:58,121 --> 00:13:59,755
They sit on your desk for weeks.

226
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:02,672
If there's a space for my signature,
it should be my signature!

227
00:14:04,381 --> 00:14:06,741
Foster and McCenahan are tearing
each other apart by the elevator.

228
00:14:06,776 --> 00:14:08,678
Right before this started,
there was a noise.

229
00:14:08,714 --> 00:14:09,747
I didn't hear anything.

230
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:11,121
Yeah, well, the rest of us did!

231
00:14:12,788 --> 00:14:15,134
There was some kind
of high-pitched whine,

232
00:14:15,169 --> 00:14:19,114
and we got another one of those emails.
It said, "have fun trying to survive the day".

233
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:20,767
Show me.

234
00:14:20,803 --> 00:14:22,840
Okay, everybody try to stay calm.

235
00:14:22,893 --> 00:14:26,449
If this noise or signal did something
to you... you've got to fight it.

236
00:14:27,482 --> 00:14:28,855
What she's talking about?

237
00:14:30,711 --> 00:14:32,789
What did I just tell you?

238
00:14:44,239 --> 00:14:45,742
- Nina.
- You saw it.

239
00:14:46,388 --> 00:14:49,217
She pulled her weapon first.
I was defending myself...

240
00:14:51,014 --> 00:14:52,087
How is she?

241
00:14:52,174 --> 00:14:54,170
Breathing.
She's bleeding pretty bad.

242
00:14:54,205 --> 00:14:56,507
Get her to medical.
Park is under arrest.

243
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:57,984
Crowley, restrain him.

244
00:15:02,023 --> 00:15:03,514
Baldwin, what are you doing?

245
00:15:03,547 --> 00:15:06,928
Until we know what's going on,
nobody gets in and nobody goes out.

246
00:15:09,077 --> 00:15:10,122
What's going on?

247
00:15:19,682 --> 00:15:21,596
Security procedure enabled.

248
00:15:23,028 --> 00:15:26,511
Who's a very good girl?
Isabelle is.

249
00:15:26,546 --> 00:15:28,906
Isabelle's a smartie.

250
00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:31,117
Glad to see you guys are having fun.

251
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:33,336
Lily. I didn't expect to
see you till 5:00.

252
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:36,025
Well, I'm taking an early lunch. I thought
I'd take Isabelle out to the garden.

253
00:15:36,072 --> 00:15:39,066
That sounds fun.
Doesn't it, little girl?

254
00:15:39,663 --> 00:15:42,645
Oh, I use flash cards with her
all the time.

255
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:45,040
Let's see if I can find an apple.
It's her favorite.

256
00:15:55,167 --> 00:15:56,412
What is this?

257
00:15:59,711 --> 00:16:04,450
Someone's been mixing up our cards.
I've told them a million times.

258
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:06,070
What do you use these for?

259
00:16:06,105 --> 00:16:07,902
These don't belong in the nursery.

260
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:12,563
I think they use them for the applicants.
Part of their psych profile. Sorry.

261
00:16:12,915 --> 00:16:14,585
Okay, Isabelle.

262
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:17,568
Going to go with mommy.

263
00:16:18,307 --> 00:16:19,329
Okay.

264
00:16:20,139 --> 00:16:21,301
See you real soon.

265
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:39,239
Well, the movement
is part faith, part science.

266
00:16:39,286 --> 00:16:40,660
It's a potent combination.

267
00:16:40,707 --> 00:16:43,771
The movement's 100,000 members
would certainly agree,

268
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:47,925
but Kevin Burkhoff, a neuroscientist
at Western Washington University,

269
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,287
thinks otherwise.

270
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:53,484
Uh, I don't question anybody's faith.
Why should I? Faith is a good thing, right?

271
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,165
But what they're doing over there at the center
has nothing to do with science. I mean,

272
00:16:57,200 --> 00:17:01,591
you tell me how fasting,
meditation, and chanting

273
00:17:01,638 --> 00:17:05,895
can alter, in any way, your
neurochemistry. It's preposterous.

274
00:17:05,995 --> 00:17:08,373
It's a good scam,
but still preposterous.

275
00:17:08,396 --> 00:17:09,852
"Scam". That's a strong word.

276
00:17:09,876 --> 00:17:12,858
It fits. They're taking
this kernel of truth

277
00:17:12,893 --> 00:17:16,977
about the brain's potential, and using it
to bilk people out of their life savings.

278
00:17:17,013 --> 00:17:19,925
A lot of people might be surprised
by your stance. After all,

279
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:23,195
you suffered from paranoid
personality disorder for years.

280
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:27,328
Wasn't it a device engineered
by a 4400 that cured you?

281
00:17:27,498 --> 00:17:29,177
Yes, and I'm grateful,

282
00:17:29,365 --> 00:17:33,644
but you need to make the distinction
between the 4400 and the 4400 center.

283
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:36,849
4400s have remarkable abilities...
everybody knows it...

284
00:17:36,896 --> 00:17:40,595
but the center is co-opting
that phenomenon for profit.

285
00:17:40,618 --> 00:17:43,345
Those machines they're hooking
people up to over there?

286
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:45,553
They might as well not
even be plugged in.

287
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:48,617
If you ask me, he still
looks rather demented.

288
00:17:49,721 --> 00:17:53,300
He seemed pretty sane to me, Matthew,
especially when he was ripping us...

289
00:17:53,347 --> 00:17:55,049
Shawn, don't overreact.

290
00:17:55,096 --> 00:17:56,329
It's just one interview.

291
00:17:56,364 --> 00:17:57,092
Oh...

292
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,367
You did good, though.

293
00:18:00,518 --> 00:18:01,398
Yeah.

294
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:04,522
Garrity, give me the gun.

295
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:07,258
Look, this is crazy, Baldwin.

296
00:18:07,293 --> 00:18:08,547
How are we going to
defend ourselves?

297
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:10,872
Whoever's doing this wants us
to attack each other.

298
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:13,232
If we stay armed, we're dead
by the end of the day.

299
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,747
If we don't, we'll be slaughtered.

300
00:18:14,782 --> 00:18:17,523
Look, everyone in the building
is under the effects of this thing, okay?

301
00:18:17,558 --> 00:18:20,235
The cafeteria staff could be
forming an army right now.

302
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:23,100
Which is why I'll find out
who's doing this and stop it.

303
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:26,282
They're doing checkups in the medical lab today.
That means there's 4400s in the building.

304
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,733
You think that one of them
is behind this?

305
00:18:27,768 --> 00:18:28,602
I...

306
00:18:29,377 --> 00:18:30,610
I don't know,

307
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,899
but right now,
it's all I have to go on.

308
00:18:33,287 --> 00:18:34,285
You?

309
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:35,987
Who put you in command?

310
00:18:36,028 --> 00:18:37,613
He's not. I am.

311
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:40,627
This building is the target
of a 4400 terrorist attack.

312
00:18:40,651 --> 00:18:42,224
It is now a military situation.

313
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:43,538
This is great, Baldwin.

314
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,698
Why don't you explain to these guys
why they should just lay down their arms, huh?

315
00:18:46,721 --> 00:18:50,699
Major Culp, the signal, whatever it is,
it's like someone set off a rage bomb.

316
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:54,034
It's pumping up the aggression of everybody
in the building. The men, anyway.

317
00:18:54,087 --> 00:18:56,388
We cannot be walking around
with loaded firearms.

318
00:18:56,412 --> 00:18:59,089
My team's trained to resist
psychological pressure tactics.

319
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,731
This is a 4400 ability.
You can't resist it.

320
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:04,855
There's 4400s down in the med lab.
It's probably one of them doing it.

321
00:19:04,902 --> 00:19:06,909
Baldwin was just headed
down there right now.

322
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,565
Cartwright, watch them.

323
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,006
Everyone else, with me.

324
00:19:10,029 --> 00:19:11,063
Just wait. Wait.

325
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,117
What are you going to do?

326
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,067
I'm going to find out which one of
them's responsible for this.

327
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:16,182
And then what?

328
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:18,542
I'm going to make sure that it stops.

329
00:19:19,045 --> 00:19:21,006
Be careful.
There's a little girl down there.

330
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,602
If it's not her,

331
00:19:23,824 --> 00:19:25,550
then she has nothing
to worry about.

332
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:33,457
You have to let me out!

333
00:19:34,302 --> 00:19:35,770
We got to get out!

334
00:19:36,369 --> 00:19:37,825
We're going to get killed!

335
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,042
Would you stop saying
that already?

336
00:19:41,004 --> 00:19:42,507
It's not helping.

337
00:19:48,108 --> 00:19:49,653
An "a"?
That's great.

338
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:52,377
But what's my name
doing on here?

339
00:19:53,786 --> 00:19:55,606
Well, we're lab partners, right?

340
00:19:55,852 --> 00:19:57,496
This is our presentation.

341
00:19:57,708 --> 00:20:00,930
But I haven't met with you in almost three
weeks. I didn't type a word of this.

342
00:20:00,953 --> 00:20:04,628
Well, it's not like you didn't do anything.
You said you wanted to do a paper on mitosis.

343
00:20:04,664 --> 00:20:06,343
You stained the slides.

344
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:08,339
One or two of them, maybe.

345
00:20:08,374 --> 00:20:10,969
Look... you were in trouble, right?

346
00:20:11,075 --> 00:20:13,682
I just figured
that whatever it was,

347
00:20:13,752 --> 00:20:16,638
you could probably do without
an "incomplete" in bio.

348
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:23,178
I still don't know if I deserve this,
but thank you.

349
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:24,429
What can I say?

350
00:20:24,699 --> 00:20:26,801
I have a soft spot for stray cats.

351
00:20:27,931 --> 00:20:29,563
I look that pathetic?

352
00:20:33,238 --> 00:20:34,119
Hardly.

353
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,320
You're shooting up?

354
00:20:44,579 --> 00:20:46,610
Doesn't exactly fill me
with confidence.

355
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:48,718
It's a sedative.
If I lose control

356
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:50,784
and become like everyone
else in this place,

357
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:52,628
I can't help you anymore.

358
00:20:52,663 --> 00:20:54,213
What's happening to my agents?

359
00:20:54,612 --> 00:20:56,937
I don't feel any different,
but they're all going crazy.

360
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,742
Dr. Hudson?

361
00:21:01,492 --> 00:21:03,265
I feel worse.

362
00:21:03,852 --> 00:21:05,531
You shouldn't be out of bed.

363
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,310
Sweetie, what's that on your arm?

364
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:24,418
Skouris, NTAC.
I need to get past.

365
00:21:24,453 --> 00:21:25,792
Building's locked down.

366
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,607
Well, what's going on?

367
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:29,380
Security breach from the inside.

368
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:30,495
That's all we know.

369
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:32,409
- I have to get through.
- That's not going to happen.

370
00:21:32,444 --> 00:21:33,760
You don't understand.

371
00:21:34,229 --> 00:21:35,932
My daughter's in there.

372
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,352
Thursday, July 28
3:19 pm

373
00:21:58,412 --> 00:22:00,162
Well, I can't do it myself.

374
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,918
Turn around.

375
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:12,502
Hold still.

376
00:22:25,985 --> 00:22:28,486
I can't believe you
broke my nose.

377
00:22:28,509 --> 00:22:30,775
Yeah, well, you broke
my knuckle when I hit you.

378
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:33,319
But I'm still right.
The signal is constant.

379
00:22:33,354 --> 00:22:36,630
It doesn't matter if you can hear it
or not. It's like a dog whistle.

380
00:22:36,677 --> 00:22:40,798
It's one pulse, and it'll wear off.
We just have to wait it out...

381
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,228
Both of you guys shut up!

382
00:22:43,568 --> 00:22:44,907
I'm trying to get work done.

383
00:22:49,697 --> 00:22:51,282
Not a good time, Diana.

384
00:22:51,318 --> 00:22:52,780
Marco, what's going on in there?

385
00:22:52,803 --> 00:22:54,353
Depends on who you ask.

386
00:22:54,388 --> 00:22:56,443
Somebody's definitely
set off a whammy in here.

387
00:22:56,490 --> 00:22:58,604
Something's pumping up
our "fight or flight" instincts.

388
00:22:58,639 --> 00:23:00,717
Heavy emphasis
on the "fight" part.

389
00:23:00,752 --> 00:23:03,110
Well, Marco, I need to get inside,
and I need your help.

390
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:06,961
Every male in this building has got a gallon of
adrenaline coursing through his veins right now.

391
00:23:06,984 --> 00:23:10,296
And most of them are armed.
If you're on the outside, stay there.

392
00:23:10,343 --> 00:23:13,752
Listen to me, Marco. Maia is inside,
and I need to get to her.

393
00:23:13,799 --> 00:23:16,007
Do you have access
to the building schematics?

394
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:18,038
Uh, yeah.
I can pull them up.

395
00:23:18,073 --> 00:23:19,247
Do it.

396
00:23:19,776 --> 00:23:21,667
And what do I get in return?

397
00:23:24,473 --> 00:23:26,998
Well, we can talk about that later.

398
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,135
Good. Good.
I'm going to hold you to that.

399
00:23:29,182 --> 00:23:30,547
Get off me.
You're in my space!

400
00:23:30,571 --> 00:23:31,114
Hang on.

401
00:23:31,172 --> 00:23:32,766
- You're in my space!
- Guys!

402
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:34,516
Settle it later!

403
00:23:34,927 --> 00:23:36,524
We've got to get
Skouris into the building.

404
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:37,757
I said get on your knees.

405
00:23:37,792 --> 00:23:40,208
I just need to take these.
They're keeping me calm.

406
00:23:40,244 --> 00:23:41,570
Little late for that.

407
00:23:42,792 --> 00:23:45,187
You sure you don't want one?
They might help.

408
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,437
Cut us loose. Come on.
Cut me free.

409
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:55,518
Get some cuffs.

410
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:58,545
Put them on commando-boy.
Then you can let everybody else go.

411
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,989
Hey, hey, where are you going?

412
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:03,629
I'm going to the med labs. Hopefully
the major met some resistance along the way.

413
00:24:06,494 --> 00:24:08,526
What kind of tests?
You mean like an I.Q. thing?

414
00:24:08,549 --> 00:24:11,234
I don't know, Richard.
Those flash cards were weird,

415
00:24:11,269 --> 00:24:14,240
and after we got back,
I was changing her.

416
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:16,529
She has these marks on her skin.

417
00:24:16,694 --> 00:24:18,056
Marks? Bruises?

418
00:24:18,092 --> 00:24:19,959
No. Like irritations.

419
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,589
Like someone had her
hooked up to something.

420
00:24:22,636 --> 00:24:23,446
Let me see.

421
00:24:23,482 --> 00:24:24,527
They faded.

422
00:24:24,585 --> 00:24:25,419
Richard...

423
00:24:25,654 --> 00:24:28,170
don't look at me like that.
I'm not imagining things.

424
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,155
She's not going back
to that nursery.

425
00:24:30,178 --> 00:24:33,067
Lily... all you've been talking about
is how much you love Ruth

426
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:36,108
and the nursery, and how much
Isabelle seems to love it there.

427
00:24:36,131 --> 00:24:37,411
I wish you'd been there.

428
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:40,451
I mean, Ruth, she had
this weird smile on her face.

429
00:24:40,486 --> 00:24:43,821
Think about what you're saying.
Nobody's doing tests on her at the nursery.

430
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,414
You know, I know you feel
like she's shutting you out, and

431
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,253
no offense, but maybe
this is an overreaction.

432
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,777
- Can I take her for a second?
- No.

433
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,703
Lily, what are you doing?

434
00:24:55,407 --> 00:24:57,884
I'm sorry.
It's just this place.

435
00:24:58,835 --> 00:25:02,675
I feel like it's changing everything,
like it's changing us.

436
00:25:05,986 --> 00:25:08,047
We're okay.
Everything's okay.

437
00:25:12,697 --> 00:25:17,499
The meditation courses, the synaptic potential
readers, and our purification seminars...

438
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,175
that's half our curriculum
you're putting on the chopping block.

439
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,971
We don't need them, Matthew.

440
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,556
Jordan seemed to think we did.

441
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:24,517
Jordan's not here anymore, is he?

442
00:25:25,832 --> 00:25:27,955
Besides, that Burkhoff guy is right...

443
00:25:28,025 --> 00:25:31,383
a bunch of chanting is not going to
unlock the 4400 inside of anyone.

444
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:33,990
Whether it will or it won't,
the product is selling.

445
00:25:34,025 --> 00:25:35,481
Wait, wait, wait.
"Product"?

446
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:38,095
This is not a pyramid scheme, Matthew.

447
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:41,923
People are coming here, they're looking to be
changed. They're looking for answers.

448
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,497
And we'll find them,

449
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,880
but if we change, we look weak.

450
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:49,356
For now, all that matters is that
people believe in what we're doing.

451
00:25:49,403 --> 00:25:51,153
I need to believe in it, too.

452
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:11,341
Nobody move!

453
00:26:12,727 --> 00:26:14,500
They're gone.
They all took off.

454
00:26:14,535 --> 00:26:15,392
Who are you?

455
00:26:15,427 --> 00:26:16,966
Roger Wolcott.

456
00:26:17,553 --> 00:26:18,997
I'm just here for my checkup.

457
00:26:19,357 --> 00:26:20,190
The 4400?

458
00:26:20,226 --> 00:26:21,811
Why else would I be here?

459
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,560
Now cut me loose!

460
00:26:31,758 --> 00:26:33,391
Thursday, July 28
4:22 pm

461
00:26:56,508 --> 00:26:59,631
That's not going to hold anybody.
Not for long. Let's hope no one finds us.

462
00:26:59,654 --> 00:27:01,298
What do you think
our chances are?

463
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:07,506
The calmer we are,
the longer we stay alive.

464
00:27:10,888 --> 00:27:12,144
How are you doing, sweetie?

465
00:27:13,234 --> 00:27:15,617
I feel all sweaty,

466
00:27:16,745 --> 00:27:19,281
and it's getting hard to breathe.

467
00:27:19,316 --> 00:27:20,655
Poor baby.

468
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:22,745
I have something for you.

469
00:27:26,257 --> 00:27:27,865
- Lemon.
- Yeah.

470
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,116
As soon as this is over, I'm going
to get you to the hospital, okay?

471
00:27:32,773 --> 00:27:33,525
All right.

472
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,563
I'm guessing you don't have
a stuffed animal for me.

473
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,818
Maybe a fifth of Jack Daniels?

474
00:27:38,856 --> 00:27:39,667
Sorry.

475
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:42,262
Looks like it's starting to clot.

476
00:27:43,307 --> 00:27:44,633
You need another shot for pain?

477
00:27:45,432 --> 00:27:46,054
No.

478
00:27:46,897 --> 00:27:48,693
You need the sedatives
more than I do.

479
00:27:48,728 --> 00:27:50,290
How many shots have you taken?

480
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:51,417
Three.

481
00:27:51,452 --> 00:27:54,822
And you're still on your feet? Shouldn't that
have knocked you on your ass by now?

482
00:27:54,858 --> 00:27:57,779
Well, on a normal day, I'd be out
for the next 12 hours, but today,

483
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,905
it's barely enough
to keep me sane.

484
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:01,666
Well, thank you...

485
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:03,732
for keeping Maia safe.

486
00:28:04,132 --> 00:28:05,847
She's a sweet kid.

487
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:08,196
Listen, Diana...

488
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:13,562
Iook, I've only got
three shots left.

489
00:28:13,597 --> 00:28:15,947
They're wearing off a little
faster each time, so...

490
00:28:16,452 --> 00:28:19,787
I don't want to hurt anybody.
I don't want to kill anybody. So if I...

491
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,266
... start to go...

492
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:23,143
Oh, don't worry.
I'll take care of you.

493
00:28:23,178 --> 00:28:24,411
Do me a favor...

494
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:26,560
... back of the head, okay?

495
00:28:26,748 --> 00:28:28,344
You'll never see it coming.

496
00:28:30,352 --> 00:28:31,833
Now, listen, Hudson...

497
00:28:31,997 --> 00:28:34,498
Look, I just gave you permission
to blow my head off.

498
00:28:34,534 --> 00:28:36,307
Why don't you call me Max?

499
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:38,291
All right, Max.

500
00:28:39,982 --> 00:28:41,664
About this signal...

501
00:28:45,315 --> 00:28:47,840
Which one of these bitches
do you think is sending it?

502
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,578
I don't see what this
has to do with anything.

503
00:28:59,942 --> 00:29:01,762
Hey, you wanted to
know my story.

504
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:03,748
Well, right now, you're living it.

505
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,627
Open your eyes.

506
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,782
Now, imagine three years went
by while you had them shut.

507
00:29:12,954 --> 00:29:14,072
Can't do it.

508
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:16,198
Neither could I...

509
00:29:16,444 --> 00:29:17,618
but they were gone.

510
00:29:18,229 --> 00:29:21,857
I missed senior year of high school,
which is supposedly the best year ever.

511
00:29:22,370 --> 00:29:25,517
I got robbed. The rest
of high school just sucked.

512
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:29,873
So this blackout that
you had behind the wheel,

513
00:29:30,202 --> 00:29:33,906
that was some sort of
after-effect of the coma?

514
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:35,761
Yeah.

515
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:36,783
Wow.

516
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,495
God, you've been through so much.

517
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,763
You're jealous?

518
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,039
What part sounds good?

519
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:45,584
The coma?

520
00:29:46,359 --> 00:29:47,721
The hit and run?

521
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:49,083
I'm jealous

522
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:52,978
because you have all
this experience under your belt.

523
00:29:54,657 --> 00:29:55,796
It makes you interesting.

524
00:30:00,449 --> 00:30:02,398
But I didn't do it.

525
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:05,381
It wasn't me.

526
00:30:07,553 --> 00:30:10,465
Great, so now someone
can kill me in my sleep.

527
00:30:10,569 --> 00:30:12,084
How do you know it's one of us?

528
00:30:12,131 --> 00:30:13,188
Well, I don't,

529
00:30:13,223 --> 00:30:16,006
but none of you are talking,
and so I'm about out of options.

530
00:30:16,041 --> 00:30:18,237
This isn't going to make
a damn bit of difference.

531
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:22,252
That's it.

532
00:30:22,956 --> 00:30:24,142
No more sedatives.

533
00:30:24,178 --> 00:30:25,927
Can you still function as a doctor?

534
00:30:26,103 --> 00:30:27,195
For now.

535
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:33,907
Kind of busy here, Diana.

536
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:37,018
We just put the 4400s under, but we're
not sure if that's killed the signal.

537
00:30:37,054 --> 00:30:38,591
Do you still feel amped up?

538
00:30:38,615 --> 00:30:41,151
Yes, I do, okay?
I'm working on it from my end.

539
00:30:46,482 --> 00:30:47,396
What's that noise?

540
00:30:47,442 --> 00:30:49,197
I'm trying to counter
the effects of the signal.

541
00:30:49,227 --> 00:30:52,315
If you'd just shut up for a second,
maybe I could find the right frequency...

542
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:54,990
Okay, calm down, Marco.
I need you to do this.

543
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:57,303
It always has to be me,
doesn't it?

544
00:30:57,338 --> 00:30:59,996
Old, reliable Marco
does whatever you want.

545
00:32:09,699 --> 00:32:12,200
I truly believe in what
we're trying to do.

546
00:32:12,247 --> 00:32:15,740
The 4400 are the template
for the next stage in human evolution.

547
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:18,217
Do you mind backing up?
You're standing a little close.

548
00:32:30,754 --> 00:32:33,866
We can recreate the technology
they used to change us.

549
00:32:34,946 --> 00:32:37,283
Not by chanting "om"
three times, you can't.

550
00:32:37,318 --> 00:32:38,151
Agreed...

551
00:32:40,265 --> 00:32:43,693
But if you come to work with us,
we could get somewhere.

552
00:32:43,717 --> 00:32:44,586
You know,

553
00:32:45,243 --> 00:32:46,429
the government

554
00:32:46,793 --> 00:32:49,198
has approached me
half a dozen times.

555
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,757
They seem to have
this bizarre theory I'm

556
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:55,771
the father of this new branch
of science. I turned them down.

557
00:32:56,816 --> 00:32:59,599
I don't like working
with people with badges.

558
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:02,661
Listen, you can't blame
them for being curious.

559
00:33:02,696 --> 00:33:06,066
You were in a mental hospital
for... six years?

560
00:33:06,136 --> 00:33:08,966
The future busted its ass
to get you working again.

561
00:33:08,999 --> 00:33:10,831
I haven't forgotten my debts.

562
00:33:13,379 --> 00:33:14,882
Oh? What's that?

563
00:33:15,281 --> 00:33:17,794
Signing bonus?
Fancy car?

564
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:19,730
Me.

565
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,699
I'm the poster boy, right?

566
00:33:24,298 --> 00:33:25,519
Healing hands.

567
00:33:26,975 --> 00:33:28,490
Unlimited access.

568
00:33:33,432 --> 00:33:35,240
Can you really turn that down?

569
00:33:42,499 --> 00:33:43,298
Mommy,

570
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,400
I'm scared.

571
00:33:45,963 --> 00:33:47,102
I know, baby.

572
00:33:48,546 --> 00:33:49,651
I'm scared too.

573
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,612
But it's going to be okay,

574
00:33:52,105 --> 00:33:53,584
because mommy's here.

575
00:33:54,829 --> 00:33:55,498
Okay?

576
00:33:59,383 --> 00:34:01,191
Whatever's coming
through that door...

577
00:34:05,125 --> 00:34:06,322
I'll protect you.

578
00:34:19,045 --> 00:34:19,856
Tom.

579
00:34:29,861 --> 00:34:33,074
Tom... put the gun down.
It's me. It's Diana.

580
00:34:33,098 --> 00:34:35,845
No, you'll... you'll shoot me
if I put it down.

581
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,935
No, Tom.
I don't want to hurt you.

582
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,749
Well, I want to hurt you, Diana.

583
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:54,416
Tom... I said calm down.

584
00:34:58,453 --> 00:35:01,247
My mom always wanted me
to hit it off with a cute doctor,

585
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:03,971
but make another move,
and I will pull this trigger.

586
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:19,429
What is that?

587
00:35:25,713 --> 00:35:28,473
That'd be Marco
earning his paycheck.

588
00:35:50,452 --> 00:35:52,471
I feel like an idiot.

589
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:56,205
It's just... Isabelle and I
were so close for so long.

590
00:35:56,252 --> 00:35:57,825
And you still are.

591
00:35:58,471 --> 00:36:00,552
I know.
It's like you say...

592
00:36:00,975 --> 00:36:03,382
She's a baby.
It isn't personal.

593
00:36:03,417 --> 00:36:05,261
Yeah, you just have
to remember that.

594
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:08,361
Hey, Ruth, look who's back.

595
00:36:08,408 --> 00:36:09,747
That was a long lunch.

596
00:36:09,782 --> 00:36:11,884
Yeah, sorry.
Time got away from us.

597
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:13,504
Come on. Here you are.

598
00:36:14,854 --> 00:36:16,487
We'll be back in an hour for her.

599
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,766
- We'll be here.
- Thank you.

600
00:36:18,069 --> 00:36:19,455
Bye, Isabelle.

601
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:26,277
I'd still like to do
a little house-hunting.

602
00:36:26,723 --> 00:36:29,106
We could take a look around,
see what's out there.

603
00:36:40,106 --> 00:36:44,333
You're in charge until I'm released.
Pool whatever manpower is still up walking.

604
00:36:44,556 --> 00:36:45,789
Start picking up the pieces.

605
00:36:45,821 --> 00:36:47,277
- I'll handle it.
- Mm-hmm.

606
00:36:47,324 --> 00:36:49,391
All right. And you get
that head looked at.

607
00:36:53,486 --> 00:36:54,602
How are you doing?

608
00:36:55,177 --> 00:36:57,901
Well, for a slender lady,
you pack a punch.

609
00:36:57,936 --> 00:37:01,585
I can't take all the credit.
Culp softened you up a little bit.

610
00:37:01,621 --> 00:37:02,429
Hmm.

611
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,227
It's the final tally.

612
00:37:05,317 --> 00:37:08,992
Three agents dead, two N.S.A.
operatives, a 4400...

613
00:37:10,037 --> 00:37:13,264
concussions, broken bones,
stab wounds... yikes.

614
00:37:13,288 --> 00:37:16,916
It's tough to swallow. It was
a major attack, and we weren't ready.

615
00:37:17,656 --> 00:37:18,407
Yeah.

616
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:24,252
How are you, baby?

617
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:25,227
Okay.

618
00:37:26,072 --> 00:37:27,645
Not so good.

619
00:37:27,681 --> 00:37:29,452
I've got her on glucose
and erythromycin.

620
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:32,516
We're going to get her over to St. Michael's
and see if we can bring that fever down.

621
00:37:33,326 --> 00:37:34,489
And the rash?

622
00:37:35,005 --> 00:37:36,790
I'm going to bring in a specialist.

623
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,964
Should I be worried?

624
00:37:37,995 --> 00:37:42,022
Brett Kellerman is one of the best dermatologists
in the city. I'm sure he'll figure it out.

625
00:37:42,057 --> 00:37:44,006
You're coming with us,

626
00:37:44,042 --> 00:37:45,038
right?

627
00:37:46,458 --> 00:37:49,629
Of course. I'll be right there
in the ambulance with you.

628
00:37:51,672 --> 00:37:53,797
All right, I'll get to the hospital
as soon as I can.

629
00:37:53,836 --> 00:37:54,670
Okay.

630
00:37:55,175 --> 00:37:56,642
- Oh, Max...
- Yeah.

631
00:37:57,206 --> 00:37:58,873
Thank you... for everything.

632
00:37:59,132 --> 00:38:00,869
No, thank you, for...

633
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:03,229
well, for not putting one
in the back of my head.

634
00:38:06,802 --> 00:38:09,608
Uh, so those 4400s
Diana was protecting...

635
00:38:09,643 --> 00:38:13,072
they're not going to see daylight until NTAC's
sure they're not responsible for this.

636
00:38:13,095 --> 00:38:15,291
That's going to be
a marathon debriefing session.

637
00:38:15,338 --> 00:38:17,450
Yeah, I bet you they'll
both be up all night.

638
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:19,152
Both?

639
00:38:20,397 --> 00:38:22,076
I thought Diana said
there was three of them.

640
00:38:29,084 --> 00:38:29,800
Tom?

641
00:38:29,847 --> 00:38:30,881
She's gone.

642
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:35,357
A 4400 nearly took down
a fortified government facility,

643
00:38:35,385 --> 00:38:37,553
and walked away
without breaking a sweat.

644
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,556
Do they even have
a name for that?

645
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:43,245
Yeah, "terrorism".

646
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:48,989
Payback is a bitch.

647
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:10,917
Welcome to the center.
Would you like to sign up for the tour?

648
00:39:11,703 --> 00:39:12,455
No.

649
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:17,339
Tell Shawn Farrell that Kevin
Burkhoff is here to see him.

650
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:20,206
I'm sorry. Mr. Farrell's
busy at the moment.

651
00:39:20,253 --> 00:39:22,355
Is there a message
I can pass along?

652
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:23,048
Yes.

653
00:39:23,811 --> 00:39:25,761
I want to get
started immediately.

654
00:39:28,509 --> 00:39:30,446
You can stay over if you like.

655
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:33,663
Get some dinner,

656
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:36,569
do a little studying...

657
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:44,365
Kyle?

658
00:39:47,926 --> 00:39:49,147
Are you okay?

659
00:39:55,183 --> 00:39:56,768
I don't deserve you.

660
00:40:02,242 --> 00:40:03,921
That is so sweet.

661
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,065
I'll be right back.

662
00:40:16,235 --> 00:40:16,931
Okay.

663
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,223
Shawn...

664
00:40:38,045 --> 00:40:39,747
this is Olivia Cohen.

665
00:40:39,841 --> 00:40:41,109
Take a seat here.

666
00:40:41,144 --> 00:40:42,025
Mm-hmm.

667
00:40:43,164 --> 00:40:44,855
That's good.

668
00:40:45,371 --> 00:40:48,934
She lost her eyesight to macular
degeneration 10 years ago.

669
00:40:49,087 --> 00:40:52,187
The foundation was
very moved by her story.

670
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:54,859
Hi, Mrs. Cohen.

671
00:40:55,012 --> 00:40:55,681
Hello.

672
00:40:55,716 --> 00:40:57,384
It's nice to meet you.
So, uh,

673
00:40:58,217 --> 00:40:59,720
what we're going to do here

674
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:02,069
is going to feel
a little weird, but

675
00:41:02,221 --> 00:41:03,405
when we're done,

676
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:04,849
you'll be able to see again.

677
00:41:05,178 --> 00:41:06,680
Oh, I can't wait.

678
00:41:07,315 --> 00:41:09,428
I have to admit,
I'm a little nervous.

679
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:10,990
You don't have to be.

680
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:13,538
I'm going to take
your hands now, okay?

681
00:41:13,785 --> 00:41:14,583
Mm-hmm.

682
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:18,446
Here we go.

683
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:19,912
Here we go.

684
00:41:50,453 --> 00:41:53,364
So when does it start?
When do I see again?

685
00:41:53,411 --> 00:41:54,856
Just give me a moment.

686
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:56,840
Shawn?

687
00:41:57,274 --> 00:41:57,897
Oh...

688
00:41:59,878 --> 00:42:00,676
What's wrong?

689
00:42:01,569 --> 00:42:02,508
I don't know.

690
00:42:04,128 --> 00:42:05,617
Is it warm in here?
