1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,130
Previously on The 4400...

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,500
All right, listen up, everyone.

3
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:04,300
We're at DEFCON One.

4
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,030
A comet cannot change course.

5
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:08,000
This one has.

6
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:09,500
Then it's not a comet.

7
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,430
We're not sure what's just happened.

8
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,630
The light is gone

9
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,200
and thousands of people

10
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,860
have just suddenly appeared...

11
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,130
A lekinetic insurance salesman,

12
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,560
a clairvoyant eight-year
old, and now some kind

13
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,000
of sad sack super vigilante.

14
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,000
They can't hurt me.

15
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,000
No one can.

16
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,130
And those are only
the ones we know about.

17
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,860
Unless you can think
of anyone else.

18
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,000
There's nothing to tell.

19
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,000
I just want to know what's
going on between you two.

20
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,060
Yore my brother.

21
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,860
She's your girlfriend.

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,730
It's all good.

23
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,830
No. Wee not actually a couple.

24
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:48,830
So, it's just you and the baby?

25
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,360
No. It'll be the three of us.

26
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:53,930
What the hell
did you do to Kyle?

27
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,760
I didn't do anythingo him!

28
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,400
Then can I go home?

29
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,200
Home?

30
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,200
With you.

31
00:01:04,630 --> 00:01:05,600
I don't like being here alone.

32
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,200
You don't like being alone either.

33
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,500
They said draining the fluid
might not be enough--

34
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,400
That more might build up,

35
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:13,700
and if it does...

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,130
then Kyle will suffer
permanent brain damage.

37
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:26,530
The time I lost is gone.

38
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,100
I'll never get it back.

39
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,700
But my years in the dark
didn't kill me

40
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,430
and my work remains.

41
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,000
And even though
I might not understand

42
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,160
what's happening to me,

43
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,660
I have faith in the final outcome.

44
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:48,800
After all...

45
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm doing what I was intended to do,

46
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,000
becoming what I was meant to be.

47
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,330
I look forward to corresponding
with you again.

48
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,800
I know it's been a long time.

49
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,800
I tell you this as a courtesy.

50
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,396
You can observe my work,

51
00:02:06,397 --> 00:02:10,384
but there's no point
triyng to interfere with it.

52
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,192
I'm now in full command
of my talents.

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,428
I hope the world is ready.

54
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:21,730
Despite nationwide protests,
Homeland Security reses

55
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,960
to divulge the names
or the whereabouts

56
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,560
of the 4400 living here
in the United States.

57
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,400
Confirmed reports of unusual abilities

58
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,660
have the public panicked,

59
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,760
and yet this man sitting beside me

60
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,500
says we have nothing
to worry about.

61
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,130
I'm sure most of you
still recognize him,

62
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,100
even though he's been away
for the past 28 months.

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,430
I'm talking about Mr. Jordan Collier,

64
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,699
who recently breached

65
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,494
the government's wall of silence

66
00:02:51,495 --> 00:02:55,906
and chose to out himself
as one of the notorious 4,400.

67
00:02:55,907 --> 00:02:58,230
Jordan...

68
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,930
why?

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,160
Why now, why here?

70
00:03:02,406 --> 00:03:03,943
What's your agenda?

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,300
I have no agenda.

72
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,301
But someone had to put
a human face on the 4,400.

73
00:03:09,302 --> 00:03:12,400
We have been demonized
enough by people like you.

74
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,186
Well, if you're implying
this is a witch hunt,

75
00:03:15,187 --> 00:03:16,030
I disagree.

76
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,560
You're not the one
being burned at the stake.

77
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,760
Breakfast is ready.

78
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,630
Shouldn't I be saying that to you?

79
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:34,530
Maia, thank you very much.

80
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,700
This beats a can of Coke
and slice of cold pizza.

81
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,060
And I promise, I will get better

82
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,500
at being the grownup
in this relationship.

83
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,600
It's okay.

84
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,000
I like bei the grownup.

85
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,300
You know, I think

86
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,400
you're going to have a good time
with Mrs. Banky

87
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,000
'cause I hear
she's a very cool baby-sitter.

88
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:55,230
Oh, and I talked to Mr. Ryland

89
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,702
about getting permission
to get you enrolled in school

90
00:03:58,392 --> 00:04:00,934
because that would be nice, right?

91
00:04:00,935 --> 00:04:01,300
Yeah.

92
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,200
School might be fun.

93
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:05,530
Diana...

94
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,260
you're not going
to like what's in there.

95
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,754
Oliver Knox disappeared
August 22, 1983,

96
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:29,942
five nights after the last

97
00:04:29,943 --> 00:04:31,060
of the eight bodies turned up

98
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,249
And he moved back
to Friday Harbor when?

99
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:33,700
About three weeks ago.

100
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,100
19 days before
the latest body turned up.

101
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,500
You know, it could be coincidence.

102
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,530
And the letter the guy
sent appears genuine,

103
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,632
but this latest victim
wasn't a prostitute.

104
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:44,754
The eight original ones were.

105
00:04:44,755 --> 00:04:45,663
Coincidence.

106
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:47,798
That's the kind of positive thinking

107
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:49,388
we like to encourage
in this department.

108
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,976
Because if it is Knox,
then it means we've got

109
00:04:51,977 --> 00:04:53,700
a 4400 serial killer on our hands,

110
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,630
and if that's not
a worst-case scenario,

111
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,400
it'll sure as hell do for one.

112
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,685
It's the kind of hot button issue

113
00:04:59,686 --> 00:05:00,700
that Barbara Yates lives for.

114
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,400
So I guess wre taking
a trip up to Friday Harbor.

115
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,630
Bring me back a T-shirt.

116
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,230
Alex...

117
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,460
National Threat Assessment Command

118
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,460
NTAC. Are you here about Knox?

119
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,630
Got it in one.

120
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,030
It's a small town.

121
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,960
Oliver reappeared
after 21 years in the wind

122
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,760
and he dsn't look a day older.

123
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:21,300
We connected the dots.

124
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,097
So you two going to take over
my investigation?

125
00:05:25,336 --> 00:05:27,496
Let's just say we'll be
cooperating with your department

126
00:05:27,497 --> 00:05:29,600
until we've established
Knox's guilt or innocence.

127
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,060
I could use some fresh air...

128
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,460
and some cooperation.

129
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,900
His alibi's airtight.

130
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,760
Alibi or not, we're still going

131
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,930
to want to talk to him.

132
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,691
Anything else you can tell us?

133
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:46,560
You want to know about Knox?

134
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,300
When he was 15, he was
bow hunting with his cousin.

135
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,700
There was an accident.

136
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,060
Knox ended up with
an arrow in his chest.

137
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,660
His cousin panicked and ran.

138
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:00,078
Knox woke up lying
in a pool of blood

139
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,989
with this arrow sticking
out of his chest.

140
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,300
So l me guess.

141
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,382
He pulled it out,
and he cauterized the wound?

142
00:06:05,383 --> 00:06:07,205
Even better.

143
00:06:07,206 --> 00:06:09,338
He stood up
and walked four miles into town.

144
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,600
Strolled into the emergency room

145
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,730
and checked himself
in at the front desk.

146
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,930
All this with an arrow in his chest.

147
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:16,300
Years later,

148
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,100
I asked him if it
really happened that way.

149
00:06:18,348 --> 00:06:20,566
He said every word was true.

150
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,067
I told him that must
have been the walk from hell.

151
00:06:24,894 --> 00:06:25,760
"Not at all," he said.

152
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:28,615
"It was exhilarating."

153
00:06:28,616 --> 00:06:31,160
He felt like he could
have walked forever.

154
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,260
That's Oliver Knox.

155
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,330
* So long ago *

156
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,930
* Another life *

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,060
* I can feel your heartbeat *

158
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,400
* It's not a dream *

159
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:03,360
* Remember us *

160
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:07,500
* I can see it in your eyes *

161
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,760
* We'll find our place in time *

162
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:16,730
* Our place in time beyond the sun *

163
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,200
* We'll find our place in time *

164
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,260
* Our place in time to call our own *

165
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,900
Mr. Knox?

166
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,430
Mr. Knox.

167
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,900
We have a few questions to ask you

168
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,760
about the death of Theresa Baron.

169
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,100
Sheriff Conrad call you

170
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,300
or did you jump
to the same conclusion he did?

171
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,830
Not exactly a big jump.

172
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,500
You were on the police
roll out back in '83.

173
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,730
Along with a number of other people.

174
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,694
Did you know Ms. Baron?

175
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,330
No.

176
00:08:02,506 --> 00:08:04,992
She was born after I was abducted.

177
00:08:06,496 --> 00:08:11,418
Look, I know how tempting
the math is on this murder.

178
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,530
I disappear in '83, the killings stop.

179
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:16,430
Here I am and the poor girl is dead.

180
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,830
We noticed.

181
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:19,800
And if were in your shoes,

182
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:21,613
you know, I'd probably
want me to be guilty too.

183
00:08:21,614 --> 00:08:23,201
It would be so convenient.

184
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:26,900
But I almost feel bad
I can't oblige you.

185
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,400
I did not kill that woman.

186
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:32,260
Listen, can I get you
some water or something?

187
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,430
I mean, if we're going to talk,

188
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,360
we might as well be civilized
about it, right?

189
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,400
No. No.

190
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,524
We've taken up enough of your time.

191
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:40,800
Thanks.

192
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,300
Conrad told me the story

193
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,630
about how you got shot
in the chest that day.

194
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,960
Jim does love to talk.

195
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,294
Would you like to see the arrow?

196
00:08:49,294 --> 00:08:50,700
I have it inside.

197
00:08:50,954 --> 00:08:51,923
Th won't be necessary.

198
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,600
How's Kyle?

199
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,830
We don't know yet.

200
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:11,400
Um, about last night.

201
00:09:13,162 --> 00:09:14,663
The kiss.

202
00:09:14,664 --> 00:09:16,030
That...

203
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:18,400
and other things.

204
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,448
We've kind of got a lot to talk about.

205
00:09:22,904 --> 00:09:24,004
No, we don't.

206
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:25,100
Shawn.

207
00:09:25,456 --> 00:09:27,553
You have a gift.

208
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,330
Nikki.

209
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,999
When did you get here?

210
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:33,207
How's Kyle?

211
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,807
He's still in intensive care,

212
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,253
but Uncle Tommy says he's stable.

213
00:09:36,254 --> 00:09:39,727
I guess whatever they're doing
to him this whole time worked.

214
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,300
For now, anyway.

215
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,230
Listen, I'm starving.

216
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,960
Yowant to come with us
to the cafeteria?

217
00:09:52,130 --> 00:09:55,530
Yeah, I'll bring you a burrito.

218
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,460
Why don't you start
with something easy.

219
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,560
Tell me about your relationship
with your parents.

220
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:08,400
My parents?

221
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,560
They used to argue about money a lot.

222
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:13,230
That was before they split up.

223
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,530
They divorced?

224
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,700
Yeah, I was 14.

225
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,000
Do you remember how
that made you feel?

226
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,400
Depressed.

227
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:24,130
I don't know. Angry, maybe.

228
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:28,560
Why don't you tell me
about the rest of your family.

229
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,600
They're gone.

230
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:33,960
I've got a few cousins
outside of Saint Lis

231
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:38,760
who remember me as a picture
in an old photo album.

232
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,500
Well, my husband
married another woman.

233
00:10:42,171 --> 00:10:43,657
My brother hates that I'm back.

234
00:10:50,078 --> 00:10:51,795
What's the point of this?

235
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,331
Look... you want to help me

236
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,500
Help me find a job.

237
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,660
Tell me what to say
when they ask me how old I am...

238
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,700
or about my work experience,

239
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,360
or-or tell me how to explain
that 50-year gap in my resume.

240
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,660
Everyone says that the world

241
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,330
has-has-has changed for the better,

242
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,230
that people don't judge you
by the color of your skin.

243
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,230
Well, let me tell you something:
I'm still being judged,

244
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,660
and you're sitng there asking me

245
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:20,130
about my-my relationship
with my parents?

246
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,660
Let's talk about this hostility

247
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,360
that you're manifesting towards me.

248
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:31,830
Danny, you wanted to see me?

249
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,330
Thanks, Peter.

250
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,830
So, this is where you work, huh?

251
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,200
Yeah. What's up?

252
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,860
Uh, I wanted to talk to you
about something, Uncle Tommy.

253
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:44,660
Is this about Shawn?

254
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,500
How'd you know?

255
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,430
I'm listening.

256
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,630
He, uh... he had a fight at school
a few weeks ago.

257
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,460
He might've killed the guy if
I didn't step in.

258
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,460
What'd he do to him?

259
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:02,800
Well, it sounds crazy,
but... I don't know.

260
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,300
It was like Shawn was draining the life

261
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,460
out of him somehow...

262
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,960
and I'm not the only one who saw it.

263
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:15,630
What made you decide to tell me now?

264
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,200
Just thought you should know.

265
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,700
Beautiful, aren't they?

266
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,500
I wonder if that's

267
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,660
where we were.

268
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:59,060
What's everybody doing here?

269
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,830
What are you doing here?

270
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:04,941
I don't know. I wanted to see it--

271
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:07,130
where we came back.

272
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,630
I figured it'd be a good place
to come and think,

273
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,500
you know, clear my head.

274
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,460
Most people come for the conversation.

275
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:16,800
Well, there's not
a lot of that going on.

276
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,330
Oh, give it time.

277
00:13:19,294 --> 00:13:21,473
Around 11:00, this place becomes

278
00:13:21,474 --> 00:13:24,160
one big group therapy session.

279
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,700
I'm sorry to interrupt...

280
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,700
but I just had to see this myself.

281
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,930
My name's Jordan Collier.

282
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,960
Some of you may recognize me,

283
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:52,630
and if you do, you know

284
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,030
I'm one of the 4400 just like you.

285
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,100
I'm impressed that you found each other,

286
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,100
and I'm glad that you've come

287
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,430
in support of each other.

288
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,800
And, uh... I'm cold,

289
00:14:10,948 --> 00:14:13,232
and I have to guess that you guys
are cold, too...

290
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,160
...so I want to suggest that we continue

291
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,130
these get-togethers indoors.

292
00:14:18,547 --> 00:14:20,435
I have a place nearby.

293
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,699
It's warm, it's spacious...

294
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:26,090
and I want to invite all of you

295
00:14:26,091 --> 00:14:29,195
to meet me there
next Thursday afternoon.

296
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:30,300
You listen to the news.

297
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:34,130
You read the paper. You hear the talk.

298
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:39,030
Seems like the entire world
is turning against us.

299
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,660
Well, what are we going to do about it?

300
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,030
We going to give up?

301
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,800
We going to run and hide?
Maybe.

302
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:49,930
Or maybe... just maybe,

303
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,260
we build a world of our own.

304
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,860
This is the spot where we found
Theresa Baron's body.

305
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,430
We went over everything pretty good.

306
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,260
Yeah, well, we have the toys.

307
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,881
We like to take 'em out of
the box every once in a while.

308
00:15:12,882 --> 00:15:15,396
The killer posed her after
she was dead, right?

309
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:16,484
There should've been

310
00:15:16,485 --> 00:15:18,856
blood, handprints all over the place.

311
00:15:18,857 --> 00:15:20,637
It rained the day we found the body.

312
00:15:20,638 --> 00:15:22,314
The whole scene was washed clean.

313
00:15:22,315 --> 00:15:23,973
Yeah, but if he dragged her
over here, he had

314
00:15:23,974 --> 00:15:25,144
to grab onto something.

315
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,660
Tom.

316
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,924
I'll be damned.

317
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,760
His name is Philip Lopez.

318
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:52,930
He did 18 years on an aggravated
rape conviction.

319
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,260
He was paroled six months ago.

320
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,500
We just got confirmation.

321
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,930
His prints were found at the scene

322
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,260
of Theresa Baron's murder.

323
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,300
All right.

324
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,760
Everyone set?

325
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,300
Go.

326
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,060
Lopez!

327
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,400
Tom.

328
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,430
The suicide note says
he killed all nine women.

329
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,600
He wrote that only his "time away"

330
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,100
kept him from doing more.

331
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,530
Do the dates make sense?

332
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,630
Lopez was up here
working as seasonal labor

333
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,100
during the first round of killings.

334
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,100
Guess we owe Oliver Knox an apology.

335
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,660
Excuse me.

336
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,360
Can I get a cranberry juice and seltzer?

337
00:17:24,430 --> 00:17:27,800
And, uh... give me another of
what he's having.

338
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,000
Vengo subito.

339
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,800
Vuolo giaccho con quello?

340
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,130
Excuse me?

341
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,760
Sorry, I, uh...

342
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,430
I'm going to Florence in four days,

343
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,200
and I didn't want to seem like a tourist

344
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,260
when I get there
Oh.

345
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,430
Ice?
Yeah, a little.

346
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,600
I studd, uh, Italian in college.

347
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,060
Really?

348
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,960
Tu sci bella...

349
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,830
come il tramanto di Duomo.

350
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,560
"Beautiful as a sunset over Duomo."

351
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:01,300
That is very good.
You get an A-plus.

352
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,960
And you get a free round.

353
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,930
Grazie. Hey, Felicia,

354
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:07,900
can I get a beer?

355
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,630
Need a refill, friend?

356
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,130
Thanks.

357
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,960
Listen, I, uh...

358
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,130
I know we don't know each other,

359
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
but I have something
I want to show you.

360
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,160
So, what's her name?

361
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,100
I don't know, but...

362
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,230
I can tell you something about her.

363
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:09,200
Hello? I'm so sorry I'm late.

364
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:12,130
Oh, hey, Iris. How did we do today?

365
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,900
I can't come back here.

366
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,300
What? Why?

367
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,060
That child.

368
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,330
I'm sorry. You'll find someone.

369
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,660
I told her that we wouldn't
be seeing each other

370
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:32,260
for a couple of weeks.

371
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:34,260
Why... why did
you tell her that?

372
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,830
'Cause she was going to be called
for jury duty.

373
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,760
She thought I was kidding.

374
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,000
A few hours later, her husband called.

375
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:48,860
And she got a summons for jury duty?

376
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,160
Wellhey, come here.

377
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,430
It's okay, all right?
It's okay.

378
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:03,730
What are you doing

379
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,200
here so late?

380
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,630
Well, mom said

381
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,230
he was getting worse.

382
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,900
Thã fluid's building
inside his skull again.

383
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,400
Why did they take me
and leave him like this?

384
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,260
We were both on the beach that night.

385
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:22,860
I don't understand.

386
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,560
I wish I could remember something,

387
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:26,530
'cause I keep thinking...

388
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,900
think it would help.

389
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,170
Tom said that you were here the night

390
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:34,000
that Kyle had that jump
in his brain activity.

391
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,760
And he was getting better,

392
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:40,660
and now he's dying.

393
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:44,260
Shawn, did you do something to him?

394
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,300
Shawn, tell me.
Just talk to me and tell me...

395
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,660
Aunt Linda, no, I didn't do anything.
Please...

396
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,900
I told Uncle Tommy, and
I'm telling you, oy?

397
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,900
I got to go.

398
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:18,530
I wish we could talk
to a doctor about it.

399
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:22,530
And say what? "My baby
may be some kind of alien,

400
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,230
and by the way,
I know what it's thinking"?

401
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,360
Yeah, all that'll do

402
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,700
is get me thrown
right back into quarantine.

403
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,130
I was there today
to register our new address.

404
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,500
Oh, thank you for doing that.

405
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,130
I can't stand going back there.

406
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,800
I ran into Gary Branskul.

407
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:40,000
He had the bed next to mine.

408
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,800
He told me about some get-together

409
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,100
Jordan Collier's throwing.

410
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,500
Hey, Jordan Collier.
He's the-the hotel guy.

411
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:49,800
Yeah. Turns out he's one of us.

412
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,360
Yeah, we should go.

413
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,160
Richard, come on.

414
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,330
You can't tell me teenagers didn't
make out in 1951.

415
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,330
Yeah, in a parked car by the lake.

416
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,330
Ohin a parked car by the lake.

417
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,460
That's very cute.

418
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,500
Let me tell you something...

419
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,730
What the hell is wrong with you?!

420
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,330
Are you crazy?

421
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,800
Get out of the road!

422
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,100
I killed them.

423
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,760
I killed them all.

424
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:55,230
I killed them all.

425
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,200
Hands... hands up.

426
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,530
Keep your hands up.

427
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,200
Her name was Gayle Keating.

428
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,530
She worked at a local video store.

429
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,760
They found her body in
Frick Park this morning.

430
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,600
Her blood was all over him.

431
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,200
He spoke for five minutes straight

432
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,660
when we first brought him in.

433
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:14,600
Confessed to Gayle's death
and the other nine murders.

434
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,900
Hasn't said a word since.

435
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,700
Philip Lopez killed Theresa Baron.

436
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,400
He said so in his suicide note.

437
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,130
We found her shirt
in his apartment, his prints...

438
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I know, but this morning,
Charlie Staley confessed

439
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,600
to the same murder.

440
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,260
And they both claim to be behind
the original round of killings?

441
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,300
Yeah, only Charlie's 39.

442
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,300
He was five years old

443
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,900
when the first death happened.

444
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,300
And we can eliminate Lopez

445
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,030
as a suspect in the original
murders as well.

446
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,160
How do you figure that?

447
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,760
checked Lopez's prison records.

448
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:41,900
He's left-handed.

449
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,260
According to the autopsy reports

450
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,330
in the '80s,

451
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,300
the Friday Harbor killer
was right-handed.

452
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,200
So, Lopez kills one girl,
Staley kills the other,

453
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,430
and neither one of them
committed the original crimes?

454
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,260
Why would they confess to murders

455
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,530
they couldn't possibly have committed?

456
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,630
Pieces don't quite fit together, do they?

457
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,000
Until you add Knox into the puzzle.

458
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,730
He disappears, the killings stop.

459
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,500
He came back, they started again.

460
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,630
So, let's say

461
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,400
Knox is involved somehow.

462
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,200
That means what, he's...

463
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,230
he's forcing these men
to do his murders for him?

464
00:24:18,906 --> 00:24:19,973
Could be.

465
00:24:20,457 --> 00:24:22,246
The question is how.

466
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,864
I mean, why would he want
more than one person

467
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:25,185
to admit to the original crimes?

468
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:27,391
One confession, we might stop digging,

469
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:29,039
but two - it just gets our attention.

470
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:31,410
Well, maybe he can't control
everything they do.

471
00:24:31,411 --> 00:24:33,029
What if Knox can force

472
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:33,916
people to kill?

473
00:24:33,917 --> 00:24:36,077
But only by convincing them

474
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:38,786
that they really are
the Friday Harbor killers.

475
00:24:38,787 --> 00:24:41,339
In for one murder, in for them all.

476
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,660
Good, good.

477
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:50,360
Hi. Welcome.

478
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,500
1969, huh?

479
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:52,930
Well, the good news

480
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,930
is your bell bottoms are back in yle.

481
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,860
Hi.

482
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,230
So, there's this one guy--
I was just talking to him--

483
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,030
and he was gone for 40 years,

484
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,330
and he came back

485
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,660
and picked everything up
without missing a beat.

486
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:09,960
And then there's me.

487
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:11,760
I'm gone for three years,
and I come back,

488
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:15,732
and it's like my whole life
has fallen apart,

489
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,040
everything's different...

490
00:25:17,041 --> 00:25:18,905
I know Shawn, look, the thing to remember

491
00:25:18,906 --> 00:25:20,800
is that most of us feel
the same way you do.

492
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,392
Well, some of us are
more different than others,

493
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,434
if you know what I mean.

494
00:25:25,435 --> 00:25:27,478
I'm not sure I do.

495
00:25:27,479 --> 00:25:31,632
Okay, I had this fight
with a guy at school,

496
00:25:31,633 --> 00:25:32,600
and I know it's going
to sound crazy...

497
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,360
I really can't hear
the specifics right now.

498
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:38,714
Not yet, anyway.

499
00:25:38,715 --> 00:25:40,268
I have a lot of interviews

500
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:43,044
over the next few weeks,
and I have to be able to deny

501
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:44,282
what I need to.

502
00:25:44,283 --> 00:25:48,174
Look, I, I know you're feeling
confused right now,

503
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:49,596
and I can't blame you.

504
00:25:49,597 --> 00:25:52,565
But it sounds to me
like you've been given a gift.

505
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:55,523
That's, uh, that's what Nikki called it.

506
00:25:55,524 --> 00:25:58,329
Well, Nikki's right, whoever she is.

507
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,112
And about this gift--
don't let scare you.

508
00:26:01,113 --> 00:26:03,156
You will find the right way to use it.

509
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:05,241
Okay.

510
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,800
Well, what can I do for you
this afternoon...Lily, '93?

511
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:14,260
Don't worry, it's not a line.

512
00:26:14,261 --> 00:26:16,493
Though I do have to say

513
00:26:16,494 --> 00:26:17,954
you're the most attractive abductee

514
00:26:17,955 --> 00:26:19,178
I've met all afternoon.

515
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:20,964
I'm Jordan Collier.

516
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:22,743
I'm throwing this party.

517
00:26:22,744 --> 00:26:24,530
Oh. Nice to meet you.

518
00:26:24,531 --> 00:26:25,613
Here you go.

519
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,000
Thank you.

520
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:30,513
Do I detect a little romance brewing

521
00:26:30,514 --> 00:26:31,743
among the 4400?

522
00:26:31,744 --> 00:26:33,203
You have a good eye.

523
00:26:33,204 --> 00:26:35,042
Well, I'm just happy you two

524
00:26:35,043 --> 00:26:36,743
are getting something
positive out of all this.

525
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,311
You're Jordan Collier?

526
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,536
Yes. See, he's not afraid of me.

527
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,433
I, I'm a little lightheaded.

528
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:46,572
It's hot.

529
00:26:46,573 --> 00:26:48,501
Yeah, I should sit down.

530
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:51,602
Uh, why don't I find you a seat, huh?

531
00:26:51,603 --> 00:26:53,040
I'll get you some water.

532
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:53,800
Thank you.

533
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,360
Thank you.

534
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:58,960
You want me

535
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:01,543
to, uh, call a doctor or...?

536
00:27:01,544 --> 00:27:02,798
No, I'm not sick.

537
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,808
It'll pass.

538
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:05,260
Here you go.

539
00:27:05,261 --> 00:27:06,928
Well, that good.

540
00:27:06,929 --> 00:27:09,737
If you're not sick, then what's, uh...?

541
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:11,977
It's just morning sickness.

542
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:14,440
You're pregnant.

543
00:27:14,441 --> 00:27:17,686
Uh... first trimester.

544
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:20,330
Well, that explains it

545
00:27:20,331 --> 00:27:22,612
Congratulations to both of you.

546
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,409
Did I say

547
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:27,226
something wrong?

548
00:27:27,227 --> 00:27:29,861
I-It's a little
more complicated than that.

549
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:31,414
Richard's not the father.

550
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,663
I-I wasn't pregnant
when I was abducted,

551
00:27:35,664 --> 00:27:37,397
but I was when I got back.

552
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,845
Strange, huh?

553
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,053
Well, interesting is more like it. Uh...

554
00:27:44,054 --> 00:27:45,856
Kind of makes you wonder

555
00:27:45,857 --> 00:27:47,545
what the hell they have in mind--

556
00:27:47,546 --> 00:27:49,093
whoever took us, I mean.

557
00:27:49,094 --> 00:27:52,014
You haven't told your counselor
about this, have you?

558
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:53,911
We haven't told anyone.

559
00:27:53,912 --> 00:27:56,348
Well, I'd keep it that way for now.

560
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,758
Look, how are you guys managing?

561
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,292
You have everything you need?

562
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:04,837
Yeah, everything except a job.

563
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:07,323
I was a pilot in the Air Force.

564
00:28:07,324 --> 00:28:08,902
Supposed to be drawing a pension, but...

565
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:10,749
that hasn't come through yet.

566
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,901
I've applied for flight instructor jobs.

567
00:28:12,902 --> 00:28:15,561
I even filed a application
with Seattle P.D.

568
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,754
But every time they find out
I'm one of the 4400...

569
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,372
the job suddenly goes away.

570
00:28:21,373 --> 00:28:25,150
Well, look, I may have something
you'd be interested in.

571
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:26,701
Doesn't involve flying,

572
00:28:26,702 --> 00:28:29,764
but given ur background
in the military, uh...

573
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:34,136
My foundation has an opening
in the security department.

574
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:35,577
Foundation?

575
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:36,751
For the 4400.

576
00:28:36,752 --> 00:28:39,156
Anyway, if you're interested,

577
00:28:39,157 --> 00:28:40,872
why don't you come by
tomorrow and see me?

578
00:28:40,873 --> 00:28:42,327
I'll be there.

579
00:28:42,328 --> 00:28:43,650
Good.

580
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:45,166
The rash of violence

581
00:28:45,167 --> 00:28:46,462
involving the 4400 continues,

582
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:49,826
with sources telling us tonight
that Homeland Security

583
00:28:49,827 --> 00:28:51,757
is investigating a possible connection

584
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:54,032
between the Friday Harbor murders

585
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,987
and an undisclosed returnee.

586
00:28:55,988 --> 00:29:01,160
That hypocritical, self-righteous,
irresponsible bitch.

587
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,030
Oh, I-I take it he doesn't like her show.

588
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,312
He doesn't like her.

589
00:29:07,313 --> 00:29:09,236
When we were with the FBI,

590
00:29:09,237 --> 00:29:11,614
she disclosed the name of a
juror in a RICO prosecution.

591
00:29:11,615 --> 00:29:12,779
Judge declared a mistrial.

592
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,472
Three years of work down the drain.

593
00:29:14,473 --> 00:29:17,395
You know, she blindsided me once.

594
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:19,520
That is not going to happen again.

595
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,064
Tom Baldwin.

596
00:29:23,065 --> 00:29:24,788
Yeah, sure.

597
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,111
I see.

598
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,956
We'll be there.

599
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:33,284
That was Conrad.

600
00:29:33,285 --> 00:29:35,173
He got another letter.

601
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,876
"I decide who lives and who dies.

602
00:29:38,877 --> 00:29:42,165
My judgment is final,
and more verdicts are coming."

603
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:44,213
The date's clipped from
this morning's paper.

604
00:29:44,214 --> 00:29:47,296
It couldn't have been composed
by Charlie Staley--

605
00:29:47,297 --> 00:29:48,593
not from jail.

606
00:29:48,594 --> 00:29:51,757
You telling us this letter's
from the Friday Harbor killer?

607
00:29:51,758 --> 00:29:53,038
It's genuine.

608
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,972
He describes wound patterns
on the original victims.

609
00:29:55,973 --> 00:29:57,345
We kept that private.

610
00:29:57,346 --> 00:30:02,126
If you really believe
Knox is involved in this,

611
00:30:02,127 --> 00:30:03,613
why the hell is he out
there walking around?

612
00:30:03,614 --> 00:30:04,902
Let's pick him up right now.

613
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,090
We can't do that.

614
00:30:06,091 --> 00:30:08,251
The bottom line is
we need to know exactly

615
00:30:08,252 --> 00:30:09,448
how he's connected to these murders

616
00:30:09,449 --> 00:30:10,886
before we can bring him in.

617
00:30:10,887 --> 00:30:12,027
So, what do we do--

618
00:30:12,028 --> 00:30:12,864
wait for another girl

619
00:30:12,865 --> 00:30:13,693
to turn up dead?

620
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,165
I think we can do better than that.

621
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,935
That's $27.75 - your change.

622
00:30:26,936 --> 00:30:28,008
Thank you.

623
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,048
Who's this?

624
00:30:31,049 --> 00:30:33,262
Let me tell you

625
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:34,090
something about her.

626
00:30:34,091 --> 00:30:35,059
Her name's Felicia

627
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,810
and she works over at the bar...

628
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,947
W or maybe a tax audit,lling
but I didn't think I'd merit

629
00:30:45,948 --> 00:30:47,743
an invitation into the belly of the beast.

630
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:50,576
Consider it a tribute to
the size of your bully pulpit.

631
00:30:50,577 --> 00:30:51,734
I'm flattered.

632
00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:52,526
Don't be.

633
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,251
DC is calling for your head.

634
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:57,340
I want you to dial back on the 4400.

635
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,080
Not going to happen.

636
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:01,525
I'm a journalist;
I answer only to my viewers.

637
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,145
Don't you hide behind
freedom of the press.

638
00:31:04,146 --> 00:31:05,104
What you do isn't journalism;

639
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:06,442
it's shouting "fire" in a crowded theater,

640
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,208
and you're going to stop

641
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,923
before the stampede begins.

642
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,551
Yeah.

643
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,169
You have a really strong face.

644
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,475
Seriously, Dennis,
you should come on my show.

645
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,017
You're getting in the way
of my job, Barbara.

646
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,353
And if you're going to continue
interfering

647
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:21,983
with Department of Homeland Security,

648
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,092
I'd advise you to tread lightly.

649
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:27,270
And what are you going to do,
disappear me?

650
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,700
I asked for your cooperation.

651
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,823
And I've chosen not to give it.

652
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,492
Fair enough.

653
00:31:33,493 --> 00:31:36,010
Don't forget to get your parking

654
00:31:36,011 --> 00:31:37,299
validated on the way out.

655
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:43,373
This healthcare plan is incredible.

656
00:31:43,374 --> 00:31:46,125
Yeah, well, the maternity coverage

657
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:47,733
should provide for all yo doctors' visits

658
00:31:47,734 --> 00:31:49,933
and hospital care once the baby's born.

659
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,095
Mr. Collier, I don't...
I don't know what to say.

660
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,681
Say you'll take the job?

661
00:31:58,430 --> 00:32:01,339
I'm sorry, one moment;
I have to take this.

662
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,396
Yeah, Len.

663
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,189
Oh, good, good.

664
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,661
The whole property?

665
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,696
Excellent. 26 million.

666
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:11,584
Yes, I want you to lose.

667
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:16,280
Well, don't worry about
the board of directors, Len.

668
00:32:16,281 --> 00:32:20,081
They voted me back in as CEO
when I returned, didn't they?

669
00:32:20,082 --> 00:32:21,502
I will handle them.

670
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:23,051
Call me when it's done. Okay.

671
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:27,133
Real estate deals-- they're
never over till they're over.

672
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,044
So are you going to come
to work for me or not?

673
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,967
I can start tomorrow.

674
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,270
Mr. Ryland - Phil Gibson.

675
00:32:44,330 --> 00:32:44,570
This is an honor.

676
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:46,930
Uh, Barbara will be very disappointed

677
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,430
she wasn't able to meet with you herself.

678
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,430
Actually, I prefer to speak to you.

679
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,300
Great. First, just let me
say right off the top, sir,

680
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:56,130
that any information that
you give us about the 4400

681
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,930
will never be traced back to you.

682
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,370
I'm glad to hear that

683
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,370
because I have something
very important to pass on.

684
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:03,030
Great. Do you mind if I tape this, sir?

685
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:03,200
Quick and simple.

686
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,180
I want Barbara Yates's
coverage of the 4400 to stop.

687
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:10,295
What do you mean "stop"?

688
00:33:10,296 --> 00:33:11,741
I mean it ends.

689
00:33:11,742 --> 00:33:13,801
She stops covering the story, period.

690
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:17,593
Uh, listen, uh, Mr. Ryland,

691
00:33:17,594 --> 00:33:20,972
Barbara has sole ahority
over her editorial content.

692
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:22,819
It's Barbara. Barbara says what Barbara wants.

693
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:24,032
There's nothing I can do about it.

694
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:26,436
You're her producer - produce.

695
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:30,012
I don't think you know what it's like

696
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:31,938
to work in this business these days.

697
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,026
We're not Walter Cronkite here.

698
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,034
You want to talk about the old days?

699
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,841
In the old days, I would need a warrant

700
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,545
to tap all your phones,

701
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,673
to freeze all your assets,

702
00:33:45,270 --> 00:33:47,932
and to prevent you
from ever being a passenger

703
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:50,001
on any airline in the world.

704
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:53,457
But like you say,
it's not the old days anymore.

705
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,339
Now you've worked for Barbara Yates

706
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:58,712
for a long time, since the beginning,

707
00:33:58,713 --> 00:34:00,817
and I'm guessing that you know
where the bodies are buried.

708
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,610
Draw me a map.

709
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:18,690
You're just afraid
my dad will kick your ass

710
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:20,013
if I come home smelling like beer.

711
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,324
Evil cousin Shawn.

712
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,269
Corrupter of the innocent.

713
00:34:37,979 --> 00:34:38,776
Help!

714
00:34:39,632 --> 00:34:41,049
Help me, Shawn! Shawn, help me!

715
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,030
Oh, my God.

716
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,568
Excuse me.

717
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,555
I-I lost my dog.

718
00:35:09,556 --> 00:35:10,706
Could you help me find him?

719
00:35:11,313 --> 00:35:11,664
I haven't seen him.

720
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:13,444
He's a-a wirehaired terrier.

721
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,468
His name's Boss.

722
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,300
I haven't seen him.
Could you let me by?

723
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:19,377
This isn't funny.

724
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:21,146
I'll scream.

725
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,565
Yes, you will.

726
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,370
Don't move!

727
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,370
Felicia has to die!

728
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,970
She has to!

729
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,600
This man, what did he say
to you, Mr. Mitchell?

730
00:35:41,630 --> 00:35:44,000
You've been following me?

731
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,800
No. Actually, we were following Knox.

732
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,830
You know, I really like
the composition of this shot.

733
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,270
It's nice cozy symmetry.

734
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,900
Now, what did he say to you?

735
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,254
You keep at him.

736
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,901
We'll bring in Knox,
sit him down next to his friend.

737
00:36:06,902 --> 00:36:08,274
See what they have
to say to each other.

738
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,581
Knox! Open up!

739
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:21,700
Tom!

740
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,670
Knox!

741
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,970
Tell me the police have someone
at the girl's house.

742
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,530
She refused an escort.

743
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,170
She's leaving for Italy
in the morning.

744
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,730
Hello?

745
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,300
Hello?

746
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:49,000
Excuse me.

747
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,803
I-I lost my dog.

748
00:37:50,804 --> 00:37:51,844
Can you help me find him?

749
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:52,788
He's a wirehaired terrier.

750
00:37:52,789 --> 00:37:53,495
His name's Boss.

751
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:14,870
Somebody, help me!

752
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:18,300
Stay back!

753
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,130
Let her go! Let her go, Knox!

754
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:22,200
Knox, get away from her,

755
00:38:22,830 --> 00:38:24,800
or I'll shoot!

756
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,930
I think you break my nose.

757
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:41,200
Stay down!

758
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,300
Hey, you got me all wrong.

759
00:38:42,370 --> 00:38:43,400
Let me tell you a story...

760
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,330
Not a word. Not a word.

761
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,670
Not a word.

762
00:38:46,730 --> 00:38:49,089
...damn serial killer.

763
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,384
This guy murders eight people
before he's abducted.

764
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:53,700
They send him back,

765
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,839
and he picks up right where he left off.

766
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,672
In '83, Knox was your
garden-variety psychopath.

767
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:00,098
They sent him back enhanced.

768
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,140
Big difference.

769
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,768
Well, it makes whoever took
him sound pretty nasty.

770
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,330
They also sent back Shawn.

771
00:39:05,855 --> 00:39:06,643
And Maia.

772
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,965
Yes, I know, Tom.

773
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,599
And for that, I'd like to thank them.

774
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,651
But it all seems so random.

775
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,294
Maybe.

776
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,699
Until you start to look
at the bigger picture.

777
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,037
Orson Bailey kills Adam Kensington.

778
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:19,328
Revenge murder - open-and-shut.

779
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:21,890
Carl Morrisey is a well-intentioned,

780
00:39:21,891 --> 00:39:23,753
but hapless vigilante
o ends up dead.

781
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:24,936
Like I said, random.

782
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,461
Yeah, but we know that
Adam Kensington's company

783
00:39:28,462 --> 00:39:30,229
was perpetrating a massive
fraud on the public.

784
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:33,417
And now we've learned,
since Carl Morrisey's death,

785
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:35,632
his neighbors have formed a watch committee

786
00:39:35,633 --> 00:39:36,972
that's helping to protect Bradley Park.

787
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:39,597
Anyone starting to see a pattern?

788
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:43,471
What, you're talking about
some kind of ripple effect?

789
00:39:43,472 --> 00:39:45,980
Diana Skouris to the head of the class.

790
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:49,030
The incidents themselves
are just catalysts for change.

791
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,731
But positive change
in these two cases.

792
00:39:51,732 --> 00:39:53,020
Wait a minute. What?!

793
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:54,388
Who-whoever sent them back,

794
00:39:54,389 --> 00:39:56,883
you're saying they planned
for these changes to take place?

795
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,495
What about the Knox killings?

796
00:39:58,496 --> 00:39:59,453
There's nothing positive there.

797
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,703
Or maybe we have seen the ripples yet.

798
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,170
Excuse me.

799
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:16,730
Hey, I have something
I want to tell you.

800
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:28,300
Hey, I have something
I want to tell you!

801
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:46,400
Police aren't saying

802
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,600
who is behind the release
of this closely guarded secret.

803
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,600
A document containing the names

804
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,970
and the current addresses of all the 4400

805
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,770
has appeared on the Internet,

806
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:58,200
and is now posted on more than 20 sites.

807
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:00,530
Authorities aren't confirming the leak,

808
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,970
but their efforts to shut down the sites

809
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:04,430
with an emergency injunction

810
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,430
suggest the list is genuine.

811
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:12,070
We will have more on this
breaking story as it develops.

812
00:41:23,957 --> 00:41:25,452
What are you doing here, Shawn?

813
00:41:34,379 --> 00:41:36,289
Kyle?

814
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,130
How long...

815
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:45,693
...have I been in the dark?
