1
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:42,302
We're not a threat, We're salvation,

2
00:00:42,475 --> 00:00:44,568
The world will have to deal with us.

3
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,840
Previously on The 4400:

4
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,811
You disappeared.
Any idea where you've been?

5
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:52,577
- Everywhere.
- You won't feel anything, I promise.

6
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:57,248
I saw the catastrophe and I know
what we have to do to stop it.

7
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:00,689
My life, my future,
it's tied up with the 4400.

8
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,919
- Kyle's leaving,
- Kyle, what are you doing?

9
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,894
Got a job. I'm gonna travel
around the country for a while.

10
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,830
- You're gonna get married.
- You happen to see who the guy was?

11
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:10,401
Maia, this is my friend, Ben.

12
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,231
I heard a lot about you, young lady.

13
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,930
You saw me getting married
to my sister's boyfriend?

14
00:01:15,108 --> 00:01:17,133
Are all these people 4400s?

15
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,073
Well, some are
and some just wish they were.

16
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,145
Good morning.
Welcome to the Center.

17
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:22,406
Are you a 4400?

18
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,142
No, sweetie.
You here to take our seminar?

19
00:01:25,318 --> 00:01:26,945
No. We're here to look at the school.

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,554
You sure you wanna do this?

21
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,684
I wanna meet kids like me.

22
00:01:47,507 --> 00:01:49,475
Thomas.

23
00:01:49,642 --> 00:01:51,701
What are you doing?
It's 2:00 in the morning.

24
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:54,244
I couldn't sleep.

25
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:56,678
Kyle left his stuff behind.
He wanted me to throw it out.

26
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:00,115
I figured I'd look through it,

27
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:05,121
see if you might wanna keep any of it
you know, for when he comes home.

28
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,552
Sorry I woke you up.

29
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,860
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- Shawn.

30
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,827
Devon asked for this. She's ready.

31
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,059
Ever since I first showed up
at the Center, this is what I've wanted.

32
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:51,260
This is why I came.

33
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:58,903
Besides, if anything goes wrong,
you're here, right?

34
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:10,215
I'm bringing you a message
about a better future,

35
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,850
It's here. Now.

36
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,494
This serum contains promicin,

37
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:18,722
Everyone knoWs What that is,

38
00:03:18,898 --> 00:03:22,459
It's the neurotransmitter
that gives the 4400 their abilities,

39
00:03:22,635 --> 00:03:24,398
It's here, NoW,,,

40
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,937
This video went up on the lnternet
six hours ago.

41
00:03:27,106 --> 00:03:28,164
We've tried to suppress it,

42
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:30,275
but it keeps showing up
on new servers.

43
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:33,901
With these shots, I'm going to train
my body to produce promicin,

44
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,809
Doesn't that woman work
for your nephew?

45
00:03:35,982 --> 00:03:39,850
I am going to develop a 4400 ability,
And so can you,

46
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:42,579
An enormous government stockpile
of promicin goes missing

47
00:03:42,755 --> 00:03:45,417
and a day later, an employee
of the 4400 Center shows up

48
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:47,059
on the lnternet giving herself a shot?

49
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,751
Collier doesn't care if we come for him.

50
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:52,022
- He thinks people will inject this?
- Oh, they are definitely curious.

51
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,792
This video's been downloaded almost
a hundred thousand times already.

52
00:03:54,968 --> 00:03:56,936
By the end of the day,
it'll be up to 1 0 times that.

53
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:59,469
Collier may look like some kind
of prophet now,

54
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,834
but the businessman inside him
isn't totally dead.

55
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,899
The man still knows how to create
a market for his product.

56
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,775
These shots are going
to be available everywhere, Soon,

57
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:19,015
You've been all through this place

58
00:05:19,185 --> 00:05:21,745
and I understand you searched
my other real estate holdings as well.

59
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:23,684
Yeah, the ones we know about.

60
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:26,757
You haven't found any promicin,
nor will you.

61
00:05:26,926 --> 00:05:29,326
Your employees don't seem
to have any trouble finding the stuff.

62
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,556
There's one on the lnternet right now
talking about the start of a new era.

63
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,167
It's a bold idea.
I wish I'd thought of it.

64
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,030
Devon is a courageous girl.

65
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,695
She's always aspired
to something higher.

66
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,000
I'm not surprised
she made it happen.

67
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,269
I'd congratulate her.

68
00:05:45,978 --> 00:05:47,138
If I knew where she was.

69
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,175
This isn't just a plan.

70
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,044
It's a revolution.
You realize that, don't you?

71
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:57,011
Handing out promicin like candy
changes everything, Shawn.

72
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,317
Nobody will be able to enforce the law.
It will be chaos.

73
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,959
Nobody can predict
what's gonna happen

74
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,357
once people everywhere
start developing abilities.

75
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:05,394
You need to tell us
where he's keeping that stuff.

76
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,862
I don't get you guys.

77
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,967
All along, you've been saying
we're on the same side

78
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:12,036
no matter what our differences are,
that our goals are the same,

79
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,765
for things to change, get better.

80
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:17,876
Now a man is back from the dead
to show us how to get there

81
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:19,875
and you two wanna stop him.

82
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,877
You know what? You can't.

83
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:24,141
Our phone lines have been jammed up
all morning.

84
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,684
People are dying to know how
they can get their hands on the shot.

85
00:06:27,854 --> 00:06:29,913
So, what do you tell them?

86
00:06:30,089 --> 00:06:32,990
I tell them
that we have nothing to do with it

87
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,922
and then I wish them good luck.

88
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:40,360
If he's the voice of moderation,
we're in a lot of trouble.

89
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:42,660
Tom, I need a minute.

90
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,030
There's something I've gotta do.

91
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:46,728
And don't forget
about the decimal point.

92
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,897
You just bring that above the divi--

93
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:50,633
Ms. Skouris, can I help you?

94
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,175
Yeah, I need my daughter.

95
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:57,672
We're going.

96
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,019
--4400 their abilities,

97
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:09,650
With these shots, I'm going to train
my body to produce promicin,

98
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,128
- I am going to develop a 4400 ability,
- Dennis.

99
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:15,290
We need to move against Collier now.

100
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:17,269
These shots are going
to be available,,,

101
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,530
How are we supposed to stop the 4400
if we just sit back

102
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,196
and let everyone have a chance
to become one?

103
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,208
If Collier puts this promicin
out on the street,

104
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,642
he'll be doing our work for us.

105
00:07:30,683 --> 00:07:33,880
I'm not leaving school.
You can't make me. I like it there.

106
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:36,419
Sweetie, I told you the Center
is involved in some bad stuff

107
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:37,578
and you're not safe there.

108
00:07:37,757 --> 00:07:39,349
I'm not safe anywhere.

109
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,550
At least I was happy there.

110
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:43,991
But you don't really care about that,
do you?

111
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:47,263
Sweetie, I do care
and we'll work something out.

112
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,162
We'll go back to home schooling
for a while.

113
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:50,996
Home schooling sucks.

114
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,637
Excuse me?

115
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,535
We're not finished here, young lady.

116
00:07:59,579 --> 00:08:01,103
Ben?

117
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,713
I thought you were in London.

118
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,817
Yeah, I didn't go.

119
00:08:06,252 --> 00:08:08,186
This whole "time to think" thing
isn't working for me.

120
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:09,977
I needed to see you.

121
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,252
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

122
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:20,290
I guess that can wait. Come on in.

123
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:35,144
Is April still here?

124
00:08:35,314 --> 00:08:37,305
No. She left.

125
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:40,452
Stormed out, I guess you could say,
but she only took half her stuff.

126
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,180
Called her a few times. No luck.

127
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,723
I wouldn't call me back either.

128
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,360
Look, I'm sorry that things are bad
with you guys.

129
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,462
Honestly, I haven't had much time
to think about it.

130
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,464
Maia's not talking to me,
everything's blowing up at work.

131
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,693
I have no idea
how all this is gonna end.

132
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,064
How about it ends happy?

133
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,874
I have a job offer in Spain.

134
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:07,942
It's long. Six months, maybe more.

135
00:09:08,114 --> 00:09:09,138
I'm thinking of taking it.

136
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,583
- You're leaving.
- Only if you come with me.

137
00:09:14,654 --> 00:09:16,383
You and Maia.

138
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,221
Look, think about it.

139
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:22,886
You've given everything you've had
to this job for years.

140
00:09:23,462 --> 00:09:26,192
It's time to let someone else
pick up the cause.

141
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:29,232
Better for you.
Be better for Maia.

142
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,739
I have thought about leaving.

143
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,308
Just going someplace safe.

144
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,913
Just never seemed possible.

145
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,572
But it is.

146
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,348
You have an option of walking away.

147
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:49,749
It's important you remember that.

148
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:55,622
I've been working
on the video of Devon Woods

149
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:57,160
making the rounds on the lnternet,

150
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,197
isolated the audio,
played up the background noise.

151
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:03,699
That noise you're hearing?
It's a garbage truck moving in reverse.

152
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:04,995
So wherever the tape was made,

153
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:07,639
there was the garbage truck
doing its rounds outside.

154
00:10:07,807 --> 00:10:10,139
Okay, well, that narrows it down,
I mean, a little,

155
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,277
but there must be dozens
of neighborhoods scheduled

156
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,707
for garbage collection
last night.

157
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,279
That is true, but...

158
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,243
Sound like a boat whistle.

159
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:20,715
Ferry whistle, to be exact.

160
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:22,285
So they're near the water.

161
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,548
They're somewhere
between Edmonds and Woodway.

162
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:26,089
I checked it out.

163
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,953
Those are the only blocks
near the waterfront

164
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,152
with garbage pickup scheduled
for last night.

165
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,965
I feel kind of weird.

166
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,699
Is that normal?

167
00:10:40,172 --> 00:10:41,833
Kevin went through the same thing.

168
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:44,665
You're lucky, actually.

169
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:48,280
The promicin from Ryland's company
is pure.

170
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,846
It'll be easier for you.

171
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,411
I wonder what ability I'll get.

172
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,551
I'm sure it'll be great.

173
00:10:59,425 --> 00:11:01,757
Close your eyes, okay?

174
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:03,720
Rest.

175
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:15,863
How is she?

176
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,236
She's fine.

177
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:19,969
I think.

178
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,880
She's tired.

179
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:25,884
It's hard to believe it's all starting,
isn't it?

180
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:27,952
Everything we've worked for.

181
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:30,016
It's not hard for me.

182
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,418
I've believed in you all along.

183
00:11:34,326 --> 00:11:36,294
There's a reason we were taken,

184
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:37,895
a reason they woke you up.

185
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,659
That's incredible.

186
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,098
You should be getting
the Nobel Prize.

187
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,761
Instead, we are hiding like criminals.

188
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,770
It won't be like this forever.

189
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,873
Soon we'll be heroes.

190
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,417
Oh, my God! Kevin.

191
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:01,575
Call Shawn.

192
00:12:02,154 --> 00:12:03,849
Wait, it's all right.

193
00:12:04,023 --> 00:12:05,786
It's all right.

194
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,322
Tess, hurry.

195
00:12:16,802 --> 00:12:19,270
This looks promising.
It's 351 6 Bay Street,

196
00:12:19,438 --> 00:12:21,030
two blocks west of Woodway.

197
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,198
The municipal records indicate
it's unoccupied,

198
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,935
but some offshore company
pays the property tax.

199
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:27,739
Sounds like one
of Collier's safe houses.

200
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,609
Look at this.
The utilities have just been turned on.

201
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,944
Let's go ring the bell,
see who answers.

202
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,414
It's okay. It's okay.

203
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,484
- Kevin.
- It's okay.

204
00:12:42,661 --> 00:12:45,926
There are some men coming up
to the house. They have guns.

205
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,362
We have to go.

206
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,033
- Shawn, we have to go.
- No.

207
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:54,434
Shawn, NTAC is right outside.
We have to leave now.

208
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,869
No, I am not leaving her.

209
00:12:57,376 --> 00:12:58,365
It's okay. It's okay.

210
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:01,604
Devon? Devon, you just look at me,
okay, just keep looking.

211
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:10,746
Go.

212
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,724
Devon.

213
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,594
Devon.

214
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:29,172
Shawn. Shawn. Step away, Shawn.

215
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,978
Keep your hands
where everyone can see them, okay?

216
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,413
I couldn't save her.

217
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:46,850
It's okay.

218
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,986
Come here. Come on.

219
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,355
She's dead.

220
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:52,292
It's okay.

221
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,831
Come here. Come on.

222
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,731
It's okay.

223
00:14:06,545 --> 00:14:09,105
How could this happen?
How could Devon die?

224
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:10,475
It makes no sense.

225
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:12,412
Ryland's giving that stuff to soldiers

226
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,348
and then parading them around
on national TV.

227
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,579
Well, her body couldn't handle it.

228
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:21,886
- She died of a massive aneurysm.
- Shawn, you're in a lot of trouble here.

229
00:14:22,061 --> 00:14:23,358
And the people I work with,

230
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:26,464
they believe you're involved
in a conspiracy to distribute promicin.

231
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,725
So you need to talk to us.

232
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,596
What were you doing
at that safe house?

233
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,328
Who called you?

234
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:38,368
I'm sorry about what happened
to Devon.

235
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,877
I am, but... Got nothing to say.

236
00:14:42,414 --> 00:14:45,281
Devon wasn't the first sacrifice
the future has asked of us.

237
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,975
She won't be the last.

238
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,918
We will honor her memory.

239
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,290
We can do that later.
NTAC has Shawn.

240
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,019
It's only a matter of time
before they get the location from him.

241
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,629
We need to destroy this stuff.
Cut and run.

242
00:14:58,797 --> 00:15:00,924
Why? If they wanna come,
let them come.

243
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,068
That's why you have us here, right?

244
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,170
I admire your bravery.
We may need it.

245
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,566
But not yet.

246
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,867
I tested Shawn to remind him
of his loyalties.

247
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:13,307
- He will not betray us.
- His loyalties aren't the issue.

248
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,468
We've seen it before.

249
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,172
The government wants something,
they'll do whatever to get it.

250
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,374
He will be tested. Yes, Richard.

251
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,109
But he'll endure.

252
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:23,152
Long enough for us
to begin distribution.

253
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,347
Begin distribution?

254
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:27,589
Why would you wanna do that?
This killed Devon.

255
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,352
Dosage problem.

256
00:15:29,528 --> 00:15:30,825
It has to be.

257
00:15:30,996 --> 00:15:33,965
The promicin from your daughter
is different from what I've been using.

258
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,122
It's too pure.

259
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,828
Richard, look,
we need people to develop abilities.

260
00:15:39,004 --> 00:15:42,132
If we stop now,
they will paint us as murderers.

261
00:15:42,308 --> 00:15:43,798
If we keep going, we are murderers.

262
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,543
Jordan, this is over.

263
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:48,679
I'm ending this.

264
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:11,259
Mr. Tyler?

265
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:14,535
I don't think you should do that.

266
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,876
We are all under a lot of strain.

267
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,303
Maybe you should just sit down
for a while.

268
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:26,742
Let's get this cleaned up.

269
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,483
We need to be ready to leave.

270
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,431
Sweetie, do you wanna watch
a movie? You can pick.

271
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,836
April.

272
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:53,604
Hey.

273
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:54,803
Hey.

274
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,641
I came by to get my stuff.

275
00:16:56,815 --> 00:16:59,010
I packed it up for you.

276
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,208
Is that new?

277
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,617
Yeah. A little gift to myself.

278
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,226
I like it.

279
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:11,563
Di, don't pretend, okay?

280
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:16,032
I did it to remind myself who I am.

281
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,635
I guess I wasn't meant
for that whole...

282
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,437
..."settled" thing
I was going for with Ben.

283
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:25,804
I brought you something.

284
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,377
Are you giving me a present?

285
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,811
Mom's engagement ring.

286
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,041
I gave that to you, April.

287
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,777
I don't have any use for it.

288
00:17:34,953 --> 00:17:36,784
Besides, I kind of owe you.

289
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,920
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I'm still pissed,

290
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,261
but you saved me
from being someone that I'm not.

291
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,392
Thank you.

292
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,471
Just don't invite me over
for Thanksgiving, okay?

293
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:03,507
Hey, just one thing.

294
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:07,812
When Maia predicted
that you would end up with Ben,

295
00:18:08,287 --> 00:18:10,721
did you really fight against it?

296
00:18:10,889 --> 00:18:12,982
As hard as you told me that you did?

297
00:18:13,959 --> 00:18:15,449
I thought so--

298
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:19,097
But to be honest, now l...

299
00:18:20,833 --> 00:18:23,267
Oh, I'm just not so sure.

300
00:18:28,173 --> 00:18:30,733
I'm not at all surprised that girl died.

301
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,936
It's exactly why we need
to get this stuff out of Collier's hands.

302
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,344
We need to know
about your promicin supply, Dennis.

303
00:18:37,516 --> 00:18:40,781
Your people have been working with it.
Have you ever seen anything like this?

304
00:18:42,054 --> 00:18:44,215
We've had some casualties
among the volunteers.

305
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,050
Casualties?

306
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:50,786
How many?

307
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,932
We recruited 20 men for the program.

308
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:58,729
Half of them rejected the promicin
within 48 hours of their first shot.

309
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:00,901
Rejected? You mean, died?

310
00:19:01,573 --> 00:19:03,165
We knew there would be risks, Diana.

311
00:19:03,342 --> 00:19:06,072
We explained it to the volunteers
before they signed on.

312
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,073
Oh, my God. You knew.

313
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,240
You knew what would happen
when people took this.

314
00:19:13,185 --> 00:19:15,119
Why didn't you tell us
when it was stolen?

315
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:17,084
We could have warned Collier,
warned the public--

316
00:19:17,256 --> 00:19:19,781
Because gods don't make mistakes.

317
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,255
What better way to show the people

318
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:23,724
that Collier is not some sort
of messiah,

319
00:19:23,896 --> 00:19:26,364
than have him
fall flat on his face in public?

320
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:28,591
You kept quiet
so you could discredit Collier?

321
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,436
A woman is dead, Dennis.

322
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:33,161
And you're just as responsible
as he is.

323
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,102
She shouldn't have been
injecting stolen promicin.

324
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,443
And anybody who follows her lead

325
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,408
will have to live
with the consequences.

326
00:19:42,247 --> 00:19:43,271
Or not.

327
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,882
So this promicin
that Collier's holding, if you take it,

328
00:19:47,419 --> 00:19:50,013
you have a 50 percent chance
of dying within 48 hours?

329
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,216
Or a 50 percent chance of eventually
developing some kind of ability.

330
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,655
We need to hire more agents.

331
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:57,920
I don't know. Fifty-fifty.
Those aren't very good odds.

332
00:19:58,096 --> 00:19:59,620
For a chance
to become one of the 4400,

333
00:19:59,798 --> 00:20:01,595
I think there's a lot of people
who'd take them.

334
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,166
Yeah.

335
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,859
How did your nephew react
to the news?

336
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,902
He's still not talking.

337
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,735
He doesn't think there's any way
Collier will move ahead with the plan.

338
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:12,774
Tom, we've been working on him
for almost a day.

339
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,812
We need to step up the interrogation
a couple notches.

340
00:20:15,981 --> 00:20:16,970
No, no, no. No way.

341
00:20:17,149 --> 00:20:19,640
Look, I'm not standing by
while someone tortures Shawn.

342
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,649
Actually, that's not
what I had in mind.

343
00:20:23,622 --> 00:20:27,285
You want me to help NTAC
interrogate Shawn?

344
00:20:27,459 --> 00:20:28,448
I don't think so, Thomas.

345
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:31,687
Alana, I wouldn't have come here
if I didn't think it was a good idea.

346
00:20:31,863 --> 00:20:33,763
It'll be just like
when you helped us with Collier.

347
00:20:33,932 --> 00:20:36,628
You use your ability on him
and then when it's over, you just...

348
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,270
You'd have seen everything he had.

349
00:20:39,972 --> 00:20:41,906
We just need you to tell us
where the promicin is.

350
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,063
I know.

351
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,971
But when I agreed to help NTAC,

352
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,543
I told you I'd never do anything
to hurt the 4400.

353
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:49,010
You'd be helping Shawn.

354
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:56,042
And if you don't do it,

355
00:20:56,221 --> 00:20:58,553
NTAC will consider that
backing out of your deal.

356
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,423
You'd be a fugitive again.

357
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,825
Look, honey,

358
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,191
they are gonna get
the information anyway

359
00:21:06,365 --> 00:21:08,993
and it will be a whole lot tougher
on Shawn.

360
00:21:09,167 --> 00:21:13,160
How about I call D.C. myself?
Confirm this so-called order?

361
00:21:13,338 --> 00:21:14,805
You do that, Nina.

362
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:16,736
You'll find out
how little authority you have.

363
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:18,170
What's he doing here?

364
00:21:18,343 --> 00:21:21,710
The U.S. military has taken over
the interrogation of Shawn Farrell.

365
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:25,005
- I'm here as a consultant.
- We'll be done with Shawn in minutes.

366
00:21:25,183 --> 00:21:26,912
Alana can get
all the information we need.

367
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:28,313
Quickly and painlessly.

368
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,012
Do you expect us
to trust that woman?

369
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,021
No, we'll take it from here, Tom.

370
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:36,725
I have confidence in my interrogator.

371
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:44,432
Hi, Shawn.

372
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:53,174
We can do this quickly, you know.

373
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:58,241
Just tell me
where Collier is keeping the promicin.

374
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,451
No.

375
00:22:02,287 --> 00:22:03,413
I'm curious.

376
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,717
The whole time we were planning
our wedding,

377
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:09,156
you were working with Ryland.

378
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,761
Betraying me.

379
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:13,193
Betraying your father.

380
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:15,630
Why?

381
00:22:17,869 --> 00:22:19,268
It was a "balance of power" thing.

382
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,702
I was sent to eliminate the 4400.

383
00:22:28,947 --> 00:22:31,745
I really didn't want to do that.

384
00:22:33,485 --> 00:22:35,646
I loved you, Shawn.

385
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,519
But I had to do something.

386
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,557
So I thought, if I joined Ryland

387
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:49,167
and helped his side learn
how to create abilities,

388
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,363
there would be a standoff.

389
00:22:53,605 --> 00:22:55,470
If everyone has the technology,

390
00:22:56,975 --> 00:22:58,101
no one can use it.

391
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:01,469
Did you really think
that was gonna work?

392
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,880
Ryland's gonna use those soldiers
to kill us all.

393
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,549
Not if I don't let him.

394
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,953
But whatever I have to do
to keep Collier

395
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,754
from going through with his plan,

396
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:18,952
I'll do it.

397
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,763
Baby...

398
00:23:26,805 --> 00:23:28,739
Please.

399
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,700
Where is the promicin?

400
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:36,173
Baby...

401
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:38,145
Get your hands off of me.

402
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:40,840
Now.

403
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,865
- I wouldn't disturb her right now, Tom.
- Don't touch that.

404
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,904
- Let go.
- Keep him out of there.

405
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:04,371
- What are you guys doing?
- Hold it.

406
00:24:11,616 --> 00:24:12,947
Shawn.

407
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,779
Let him go.

408
00:24:16,521 --> 00:24:17,715
Is he alive?

409
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:19,413
His pulse is weak.

410
00:24:19,591 --> 00:24:21,456
We're gonna need a medical team
in here right now.

411
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,890
Go. Let's go.

412
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,789
Did you get everything we need?

413
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,625
Newfield is such a nice little town.

414
00:24:32,003 --> 00:24:33,868
When this is over,

415
00:24:34,372 --> 00:24:37,899
Kevin's gonna retire and we're gonna
go back there to live.

416
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,203
That's never gonna happen.

417
00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,779
People start dying
from that promicin,

418
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:45,007
they're gonna hunt us down.

419
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,009
We'll be leaving.

420
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,678
I'd rather Tess not have to compel
your cooperation.

421
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,857
Give me your word you are aboard,

422
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:55,523
I'll have her let you go.

423
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,895
I can't do that.

424
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:03,593
I'm not a murderer and I'm not about
to let you make me into one.

425
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:11,008
Do you think I want people to die?

426
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,542
You honestly believe
that is part of my plan?

427
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:17,814
We will not force this on anyone.

428
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:20,042
We'll make people
aware of the risks.

429
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:21,378
That's all we're doing.

430
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:22,918
Giving people a choice.

431
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:25,419
They're never gonna take it.

432
00:25:26,892 --> 00:25:28,723
How much sadness is out there?

433
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:32,330
How many people trapped
in dead-end lives?

434
00:25:32,497 --> 00:25:35,933
These shots give them a chance
at the extraordinary.

435
00:25:36,101 --> 00:25:37,693
There will be a demand.

436
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:41,332
And that's who you wanna give
these abilities to?

437
00:25:42,974 --> 00:25:45,033
The unhappy? The lost?

438
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:49,680
They say the meek shall inherit
the earth.

439
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,277
I guess I just have more faith
in humanity than you.

440
00:26:03,862 --> 00:26:05,420
Yeah, he's stable,
that's the good news,

441
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,064
but he hasn't regained
consciousness.

442
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,460
They don't know when he will.

443
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,494
Tom, are you there?

444
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,934
Yeah. Yeah, I'm here.

445
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,528
Never ends, does it?

446
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:17,572
Yeah, I've been thinking about that
a lot lately.

447
00:26:18,944 --> 00:26:20,206
What do you mean?

448
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,944
Nothing. Nothing I can talk about
right now anyway.

449
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,281
I'll see you soon.

450
00:26:27,786 --> 00:26:29,253
Thomas?

451
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,412
Thomas, you can't go up
against lsabelle.

452
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,490
- It's suicide.
- I have to do it.

453
00:26:33,658 --> 00:26:35,182
She has to be stopped.

454
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,784
Shawn was her fiancé.

455
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:40,159
If she's willing to leave him like that,
she's willing to do anything.

456
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:44,761
The future trusted me to stop her
and they gave me a way to do it.

457
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:46,500
You'll never get close enough.

458
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:48,798
Do you think she'd let you walk up
to her and use that?

459
00:26:48,974 --> 00:26:50,498
Look, they never would have
given me this

460
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:52,199
if they didn't think I had a chance.

461
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,811
It's okay. I have to go.

462
00:26:58,850 --> 00:26:59,942
Okay.

463
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,683
I'm sorry I'm late.
Is it okay if I sit down?

464
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:09,452
I thought you were gonna be away
from school for a while.

465
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,152
I didn't want to fall behind.

466
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,921
I think that would be a bad idea.

467
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:14,690
Don't you?

468
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:19,660
Sure. We're in page 37
of your workbook.

469
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:36,880
Collier.

470
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:38,989
Hello, lsabelle.

471
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:43,760
That stuff you're standing in front of
is mine.

472
00:27:43,928 --> 00:27:45,987
It came from me
and I'm taking it back.

473
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,257
That won't change anything.

474
00:27:48,433 --> 00:27:50,264
You can't stop what I've begun.

475
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:54,395
You know, you seem to be banking
on the idea that I can't hurt you.

476
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,242
I just don't think that's true.

477
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:20,222
This is no good.

478
00:28:20,632 --> 00:28:23,624
There's no promicin
in this substance at all.

479
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:28,770
I have a message from Jordan Collier.

480
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:32,734
It's a new world,
and there's no place for you in it.

481
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:35,772
We need to get out of here now.

482
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,278
Go.

483
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,647
Go. Go. Go.

484
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,458
What happened in there?

485
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:31,293
It was all fake.

486
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,028
No promicin. No Collier.

487
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,134
What about my men?

488
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:40,837
They're all dead.

489
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,276
He thought he could kill me.

490
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,511
He was wrong.

491
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:50,949
Where are you going?

492
00:29:51,589 --> 00:29:54,251
Where the hell is the promicin?

493
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:57,223
Stop. We have to find Collier.

494
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,829
That's what I'm going to do.

495
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:03,695
I'm gonna draw him out,
make him come to me.

496
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:06,063
How do you propose to do that?

497
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:08,205
I'm going to the Center.

498
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,734
I'm gonna bring it down

499
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:12,502
- and everyone in it if I have to.
- No, you won't.

500
00:30:12,677 --> 00:30:14,770
You work
for the United States Government.

501
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,382
You don't walk in there
and just kill people in broad daylight.

502
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:26,754
Each of you will receive one bag.

503
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,485
Inside the bag you'll find an envelope

504
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:32,858
with travel money
and the name of your destination.

505
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,762
We don't have much time.
Go. These shots are free.

506
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:38,766
Give them to anyone
who wants them.

507
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,064
But be careful to explain the risks.

508
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,263
Okay, come on.

509
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:45,272
Now everybody take one.

510
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:46,740
That's it.

511
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,171
Thank you all.

512
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:52,009
You're about to impact the world
in a way that will never be forgotten.

513
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,674
- Jordan, thank you for all you've done.
- Thank you.

514
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:01,419
Dennis.

515
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,891
What the hell happened here?

516
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:07,188
Where is she?

517
00:31:08,499 --> 00:31:10,797
She's too powerful.

518
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:12,727
I can't control her.

519
00:31:13,504 --> 00:31:14,493
No one can.

520
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,799
Dennis, just tell us where she went.

521
00:31:29,087 --> 00:31:30,349
The Center.

522
00:31:31,322 --> 00:31:33,119
You gotta let me pick it up.

523
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:37,325
Richard Tyler's line.

524
00:31:37,795 --> 00:31:39,558
I'm sorry. He's not here right now.

525
00:31:47,138 --> 00:31:48,662
Your daughter is at the Center.

526
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,001
They think
she might start killing people.

527
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,423
So...

528
00:32:12,964 --> 00:32:14,864
Who wants to go first?

529
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,465
Any volunteers?

530
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:26,669
Okay.

531
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:29,580
I'll pick.

532
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,456
What's your name?

533
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,021
Amy.

534
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,857
Amy.

535
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,333
I'm gonna need you to hold still, okay?

536
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:52,025
This is gonna be quick.

537
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:01,068
Would you like to take her place?

538
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,576
No.

539
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,471
I just want to tell you something.

540
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,111
What you're trying to do,

541
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,756
it's not gonna work.

542
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,589
Oh, really?

543
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,524
I guess we'll see about that.

544
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,390
- Everybody get down.
- Get out. Go.

545
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,535
Get out. Out. Out.

546
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,611
You shouldn't have done that.

547
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,726
No.

548
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,197
Isabelle.

549
00:34:01,973 --> 00:34:03,406
What?

550
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,301
What? You're gonna tell me to stop?

551
00:34:06,811 --> 00:34:08,403
That it's still not too late to save me?

552
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,773
It's past that now.

553
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:11,642
You made your choice,
but you're my daughter

554
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:13,943
and if you quit this now,
I'll stand by you.

555
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,720
I'm sorry, Daddy.

556
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,623
But this is the way
it's supposed to be.

557
00:34:43,281 --> 00:34:44,976
Daddy?

558
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,357
Isabelle.

559
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,059
Isabelle.

560
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,028
Isabelle, I'm sorry.

561
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,933
I'm sorry.

562
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,551
I wish you hadn't done that.

563
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:27,646
Isabelle.

564
00:35:27,825 --> 00:35:30,020
- Don't bother.
- Please.

565
00:35:45,943 --> 00:35:48,138
What's the matter with me?

566
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,209
Hold on.

567
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,152
Her abilities. They're gone.
The girl's helpless.

568
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,699
Go ahead.

569
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,334
Finish it.

570
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:38,727
How is she?

571
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:40,295
Isabelle is out of surgery.

572
00:36:41,165 --> 00:36:44,066
She'll be in recovery for a good while,
but they expect she'll make it.

573
00:36:55,813 --> 00:36:58,475
Well, for a minute there, I thought
you were gonna put one in her head.

574
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,708
So did l.

575
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,549
The shoulder wound was
a good idea.

576
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,621
Let us figure out whether the effects
of that syringe were permanent.

577
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,280
If she had started to heal herself--

578
00:37:07,458 --> 00:37:10,154
I had nine more bullets in my clip.

579
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:12,986
So were they?

580
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:14,520
Permanent?

581
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:17,793
According to Dr. Anapurn,
it looks that way.

582
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:20,194
There's not a trace of promicin
in her system.

583
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:23,204
She's just a normal girl.

584
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,599
A normal girl
who's in a lot of trouble.

585
00:37:28,012 --> 00:37:29,240
Are you both okay?

586
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,374
Good, because you're gonna have
to rest up on the fly.

587
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,712
Collier is still in the wind.

588
00:37:35,886 --> 00:37:37,820
So is his stash of promicin.

589
00:37:37,989 --> 00:37:39,422
The world is about to change

590
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,351
and our jobs just got
a whole lot more difficult.

591
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:53,398
More difficult. You up for it?

592
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:57,238
To be honest,

593
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,699
I don't think so.

594
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:12,482
Make sure you send me e-mails
and take lots of pictures.

595
00:38:12,657 --> 00:38:16,024
Well, don't worry. I guarantee
there will be plenty of pictures.

596
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,356
Six months will go by fast.
We'll see each other soon.

597
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,896
No, we won't.

598
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,558
We'll be back,

599
00:38:25,736 --> 00:38:26,998
but you won't be here.

600
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:32,064
Do you hate me?

601
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:35,041
No.

602
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:37,680
No, it's just--

603
00:38:37,848 --> 00:38:40,840
I don't know how I'm gonna do
this job without you.

604
00:38:41,018 --> 00:38:42,986
I have to leave, Tom.

605
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:45,486
If Collier is right,

606
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,291
if moving into this new world of his
means more upheaval

607
00:38:48,459 --> 00:38:50,586
in the here and now,
I am opting out.

608
00:38:50,761 --> 00:38:52,058
I'm gonna find myself a place

609
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,629
where I can live at peace
with my daughter as long as I can.

610
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:56,198
Diana.

611
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:59,165
You don't have to justify
your choice to me.

612
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:09,169
You ever think about
doing the same thing?

613
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,014
Yeah, sure.

614
00:39:15,753 --> 00:39:18,779
Look, this job, this fight, it's...

615
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:23,021
It's cost me so much, but...

616
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,223
I'm in it till the end.

617
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:30,899
Lucky me, huh?

618
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:56,225
Bye, Tom.

619
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,827
Bye.

620
00:40:17,281 --> 00:40:19,408
The end of one journey

621
00:40:19,817 --> 00:40:21,978
is alWays the beginning of another,

622
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,481
So...

623
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:38,133
Change is painful

624
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:41,230
and alWays comes With a cost,

625
00:40:51,882 --> 00:40:54,112
It hurts to bear those costs,

626
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:57,186
but We can't alloW that to sWay us,

627
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:04,059
TomorroW is a mystery,

628
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:08,460
The only thing We can do
is face it With resolve,

629
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,070
We move forward,

630
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:20,642
alWays forward and into What's next,

631
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:25,239
We make a choice,

632
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,512
We act on that choice,

633
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:33,646
And all that's left is to live in hope,

634
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,224
Jordan. Jordan,

635
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,562
I got the TV working.

636
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,933
They're saying
there's a woman in El Paso

637
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,729
who just checked her father
out of a hospice.

638
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,735
He had Alzheimer's

639
00:41:48,906 --> 00:41:51,431
until she visited him this morning.

640
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:54,740
Come on. They're talking about us.

641
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,937
Let's go watch it happen.

642
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:01,740
Now, good luck.

643
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:04,615
Give it to a friend if you don't use it,
but give them the warning.

644
00:42:04,788 --> 00:42:07,621
Now you understand
what you're about to do, right?

645
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,152
There are no guarantees.

646
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,420
There never are.

647
00:42:17,234 --> 00:42:19,225
No guarantees now.

648
00:42:19,904 --> 00:42:21,269
How about you?

649
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:23,406
It's fifty-fifty.

650
00:42:23,574 --> 00:42:25,599
You want the shot?
