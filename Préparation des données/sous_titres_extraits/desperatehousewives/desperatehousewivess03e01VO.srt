7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:17,340
WHILE OTHERS WILL WAIT FOR LOVE.

8
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,700
FOR OTHERS,NEW LOVE WILL BLOOM...

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,010
THAT MAY NEVER ARRIVE.

10
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,710
SOMETHING AWFUL HAPPENED ON LAKE VIEW DRIVE LAST YEAR.

11
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,330
TO UNDERSTAND WHY,

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,380
YOU NEED TO KNOW THAT WHEN ALMA HODGE AWOKE THAT MORNING,

13
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:47,080
SHE HAD NO IDEA THIS WOULD BE THE DAY SHE'D LEAVE HER HUSBAND.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,980
CERTAINLY,IT BEGAN NORMALLY ENOUGH.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,640
SHE PUT AWAY THE GROCERIES PER HIS INSTRUCTIONS.

16
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,460
SHE HUNG HIS DRY CLEANING EXACTLY AS HE HAD REQUESTED.

17
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,620
SHE FOLDED THE TOWELS JUST AS HE HAD TAUGHT HER.

18
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:09,490
IT WAS JUST BEFORE NOON...

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,380
MAMA LOVES HER BABY.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,210
DOES THE BABY LOVE MAMA?

21
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:14,360
MAMA!

22
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,190
SOMETHING INSIDE ALMA BROKE,

23
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,910
AND SHE DECIDED IT WAS TIME...TO FLY AWA

24
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:27,430
OF COURSE,SHE KNEW BETTER THAN TO SAY THIS TO HER HUSBAND.

25
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,870
HE THOUGHT ALMA WAS HAPPY,

26
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:34,760
AND ORSON HODGE DID NOT LIKE TO BE CONTRADICTED.

27
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:40,700
SO SHE WAITED TILL HE LEFT FOR WORK,AND THEN...

28
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,510
BABY,YOU GOTTA COME DOWN NOW.MAMA'S IN A HURRY.

29
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,450
HURRY!

30
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,670
HURRY!

31
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:08,670
IF YOU DON'T GET BACK IN YOUR CAGE RIGHT NOW,

32
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,300
I'M GONNA HAVE TO LEAVE YOU BEHIND.

33

AND LIKE MOST NOSY NEIGHBORS,

38
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:42,080
SHE KNEW YOU LEARNED MORE IF YOU DIDN'T KNOCK.

39
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,870
ALMA?

40
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,660
ARE YOU HOME?

41
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:50,910
CAROLYN?

42
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,730
I'M JUST LOOKING FOR ALMA.

43
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,340
WE HAD A COFFEE DATE THIS MORNING.

44
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,200
SHE NEVER SHOWED.

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,670
UH,ALMA LEFT YESTERDAY.

46
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:01,280
LEFT?

47
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:03,260
WE HAD A BIT OF A ROW.

48
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:06,840
HARVEY AND I THOUGHT WE HEARD SOME RAISED VOICES.

49
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,540
SO WHERE'D SHE GO?

50
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,130
DON'T KNOW,BUT I WOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT IT.I'M SURE SHE'S FINE.

51
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,590
ORSON,NO!

52
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:20,410
ORSON,NO!

53
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:30,390
SO IF I HEAR FROM ALMA,I'LL LET HER KNOW THAT YOU DROPPED BY.

54
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,570
YES,ORSON HODGE WAS A MAN WHO DID NOT LIKE TO BE CONTRADICTED...

55
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,830
BY ANYONE.

56
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,090
6 month ago

57
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:03,290
IT DOESN'T RAIN VERY OFTEN IN THE TOWN OF FAIRVIEW,

58
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:07,560
BUT WHEN IT DOES,IT POURS.

59
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:16,010
IT WAS ON JUST SUCH A DAY THAT BREE VAN DE KAMP WENT ON HER FIRST DATE WITH HER NEW FRIEND ORSON HODGE-

60
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,420
A DATE THAT ENDED WITH A KISS IN THE RAIN.

61
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,600
THIS OCCURRED JUST AS GABRIELLE SOLIS WAS CONFERRING WITH HER NEW DIVORCE LAWYER

62
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:32,150
AND DESCRIBING IN VIVID DETAIL HER HUSBAND'S AFFAIR WITH THEIR MAID,

63
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:36,260
WHO ALSO HAPPENED TO BE THEIR SURROGATE.

64
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,900
MEANWHILE...

65
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,970
LYNETTE SCAVO WAS BUSY MEETING HER HUSBAND'S ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHR...

66
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,190
HERE,YOU N HAVE THIS.

67
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,700
WHILE RESISTING THE URGE TO STRANGLE THE GIRL'S MOTHER.

68
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:59,950
THIS HAPPENED JUST AFTER SUSAN MAYER LEARNED MIKE DELFINO HAD BEEN BADLY INJURED IN A HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT

69
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,790
AND WAS NOW IN A COMA AT FAIRVIEW MEMORIAL HOSPITAL.

70
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,770
AT THAT SAME MOMENT,

71
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:13,890
EDIE BRITT WAS PUTTING UP A "FOR SALE" SIGN ON THE LAWN OF THE HOUSE WHERE I ONCE LIVED.

72
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,300
EDIE HAD ALSO PLANNED TO SPRUCE UP THE PROPERTY BY WASHING DOWN THE DRIVEWAY.

73
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:25,240
BUT SHE WAS PLEASED TO SEE THE RAIN HAD ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF THAT.

74
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,950
THIS IS WHAT RAINY DAYS ARE GOOD FOR.

75
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:32,330
THEY MAKE EVERYTHING CLEAN AGAIN,

76
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:37,510
WHICH IS NECESSARY ON A STREET LIKE WISTERIA LANE...

77
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:42,520
WHERE EVERYTHING CAN GET SO MESSY.

78
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,290
today

79
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,370
WELCOME,WELCOME.

80
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:05,940
DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE WATE THE FLOORS ARE LAMINATED.

81
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,920
HERE'S A FLYER.

82
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,640
AND THEN THE POLICE FOUND HER SEVERED FINGERS IN THE GARAGE.

83
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:11,520
OH,NO!

84
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,000
AND THEY NEVER FOUND FELICIA'S BODY.

85
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:16,630
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SOMEDAY YOU OPENED A CABINET,AND...

86
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,620
HELLO!

87
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,710
KAREN,DEAR.

88
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,990
HAVE YOU SEEN THE MARBLE BACKSPLASH?

89
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,770
OH,I JUST MUST SHOW IT TO YOU.

90
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,430
EXCUSE US.

91
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,350
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO TO ME,YOU BACKSTABBING COW?

92
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,110
THEY ASKED WHY THE OWNER WAS SELLING.

93
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:31,050
I TOLD THEM THAT PAUL YOUNG WAS IN JAIL.

94
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,680
THEY ASKED WHY.

95
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,100
CONVERSATION HAS A FLOW.

96
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,550
WELL,KNOCK IT OFF.

97
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,680
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO UNLOAD THIS HOUSE OF HORRORS FOR MONTHS NOW,

98
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,650
AND YOU ARE NOT HELPING.

99
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,300
THOSE ARE FOR POTENTIAL BUYERS,YOU WITHERED OLD MOOCH.

100
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,110
GOOD LUCK TRYING TO FIND ONE OF THOSE.

101
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:51,040
MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE AN EASIER TIME WITH THE APPLEWHITE HOUSE AND THAT REC ROOM IN THE BASEMENT.

102
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,550
GET OUT.

103
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,030
GET OUT.

104
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,590
GET OUT,GET OUT,GET OUT!

105
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,810
EDIE,UH,DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?

106
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,110
YES,YES,YES,YES.

107
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,750
GUYS.

108
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,380
SETTLE DOWN.
COME ON!

109
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,080
IS KAYLA READY YET?

110
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,000
JUST A SEC.

111
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:12,810
HONEY,THANK YOU FOR THIS.

112
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,340
I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE WEIRD,I MEAN,

113
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,640
TO SEND OUT A FAMILY CHRISTMAS PHOTO WITH YOUR HUSBAND'S LOVE CHILD,

114
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:19,930
BUT IT MEANS A LOT TO HER TO FEEL INCLUDED.

115
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:20,790
NO PROBLEM.

116
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:22,560
SHE'S A GREAT LITTLE GIRL.

117
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,330
OKAY?

118
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,270
ALL RIGHT,LET'S DO THIS.

119
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:29,260
I AM JUST GOING TO,UM,CHECK THE FOCUS.

120
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:32,850
NORA.

121
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,330
LYNETTE.

122
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:37,210
WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE?

123
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,400
WELL,IT'S A FAMILY PHOTO,RIGHT?

124
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,680
TOM,COULD I-COULD I- COULD I CHECK YOUR TIE AGAIN?

125
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,570
SHE SAT DOWN SO QUICKLY,I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

126
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,460
HOW ABOUT,"YOU'RE IN THE FRAME,BITCH.MOVE"?

127
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:53,710
LYNETTE...

128
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,870
NO,I AM SORRY.

129
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,520
HOW MUCH OF HER CRAP DO I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH?

130
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:58,880
FIRST,IT'S THE LITTLE DROP-BYS.

131
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,440
THEN SHE'S INVITING HERSELF TO DINNER THREE TIMES A WEEK.

132
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,050
NOW SHE WANTS TO BE IN OUR CHRISTMAS PHOTO?

133
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,740
I'M SORRY.NO,THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

134
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,160
HEY,GUYS.

135
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,030
DON'T FIGHT.

136
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:09,290
IT'S THE HOLIDAYS.

137
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,420
NORA...

138
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,600
THIS IS JUST FOR OUR FAMILY.

139
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,320
I WOULD PREFER IF YOU WEREN'T IN IT.

140
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,740
OKAY.

141
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,690
KAYLA,HONEY,WE GOTTA GO.

142
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,630
THEY'RE KICKING US OUT.

143
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:33,530
WE DIDN'T SAY THAT KAYLA COULDN'T BE IN IN THE PHOTO.

144
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,460
YEAH,WELL,YOU KNOW WHAT?

145
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,240
I'M I'M NOT YOUR FAMILY,THEN SHE'S NOT YOUR FAMILY.

146
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,690
IT'S OKAY.

147
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,380
I DON'T HAVE TO BE IN THE PICTURE.

148
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,500
FINE!

149
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,180
FINE.

150
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,050
NO,ABSOLUTELY FINE.

151
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,620
PUT CRAZY AT THE END,AND WE CAN CROP HER OUT LATER.

152
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:54,560
FAIR ENOUGH.FAIR ENOUGH.

153
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,710
HEY,EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

154
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,070
IT'S OKAY.COME ON,GUYS.

155
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,760
COME ON BACK.

156
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,040
THANK YOU,LYNETTE.

157
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:04,780
BACK TO THE CHRISTMAS SPIRIT THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

158
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,420
TEN SECONDS!

159
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,130
I THINK THIS IS A LITTLE STIFF.

160
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,850
I HAVE A REALLY FUIDEA.

161
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:28,640
WHERE ARE MY CRACKERS?

162
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:31,780
WE'RE OUT,BUT I GOT YOU A PICKLE.

163
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:33,640
PICKLES AND SOUP?

164
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,860
WHO EATS THAT?

165
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,860
YOU KNOW,THAT'S ALL I GOT.

166
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:38,950
EVER HEARD OF A STORE?

167
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,390
YOU DID NOT JUST DO THAT.

168
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:48,870
I HATE PICKLES.
PICK IT UP.

169
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,100
DOCTOR SAY I ONLY GET OUT OF BED TO PEE.

170
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,190
BETTER FOR BABY,REMEMBER?

171
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,740
DON'T GO.

172
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,070
I NEED YOU TO RUB MY FEET.

173
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,730
THEY'RE SORE,AND DOCTOR SAY- OH,CUT IT OUT,XIAO-MEl.

174
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,820
THE DOCTOR DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT RUBBING YOUR CHUBBY STUMPS.

175
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,790
RUB 'EM YOURSELF.

176
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,160
YOU TREAT ME LIKE DIRT.

177
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:22,580
WOULD YOU RATHER GO LIVE WITH MR.SOLIS

178
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:28,470
IN A DINGY ONE-BEDROOM APARTMENT WITH NO AIR CONDITIONING AND NO CABLE,HUH?

179
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:31,570
NO,I DIDN'T THINK SO.

180
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:34,210
YOU ARE MEANEST PERSON I KNOW.

181
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:36,630
I AM THE MEANEST PERSON.

182
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,810
YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS COUNTRY A YEAR.

183
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,890
MODIFY YOUR NOUNS,DAMN IT!

184
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,840
WHAT...A...BITCH.

185
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,320
I CAN'T WAIT FOR YOU TO POP OUT THAT BABY,

186
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:54,030
BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO,I AM PUTTING YOU ON THE FIRST PLANE BACK TO SHANGHAl,

187
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,020
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE ON ALL FOURS IN A RICE PADDY BEFORE THE EPIDURAL WEARS OFF!

188
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,390
BUT YOU PROMISED TO GET ME APARTMENT IN CHINATOWN,

189
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,760
SO I CAN WORK FOR MYRIEND IN RESTAURANT,START A NEW LIFE.

190
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:11,150
TELL IT TO MY CHINESE FRIEND- SUE ME!

191
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,380
YOU KNOW,WE DO HAVE PEOPLE HERE IN THE HOSPITAL WHO COULD DO THAT.

192
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,610
BUT I LIKE DOING IT.

193
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,170
I THINK MIKE WOULD WANT ME TO.

194
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,530
OOPS.

195
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,000
SO HAVE YOU GOT THE RESULTS OF HIS LATEST M.R.I. YET?

196
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,460
I'M AFRAID THERE WAS NO CHANGE.

197
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:43,490
WELL,HOW LONG UNTIL YOU CAN DO ANOTHER ONE?

198
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,750
I DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU NOT TO BE OPTIMISTIC,BUT-

199
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,540
LOOK,I KNOW IT'S BEEN SIX MONTHS,

200
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,270
BUT HE COULD STILL COME OUT OF IT,RIGHT?

201
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,060
I SAW IN THE NEWS THERE WAS THIS WOMAN IN PERU.

202
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,750
SHE WOKE UP AFTER TEN YEARS.

203
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:54,970
THERE'S A REASON THAT MADE THE NEWS.

204
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,810
YOU MIGHT THINK I'M NAIVE,BUT I KNOW HE'S COMING BACK TO ME.

205
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,700
SUSAN- DON'T SAY IT.

206
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,180
YOU JUST KEEP DOING YOUR JOB,AND I'LL KEEP DOING MINE.

207
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,710
OOPS.

208
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,630
THAT RISOTTO WAS PERFECT.

209
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,870
JUST LIKE YOU.

210
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,220
LISTEN,I HOPE YOU SAVED ROOM FOR DESSERT.

211
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,030
I GOT US SOMETHING SPECIAL FROM A WONDERFUL LITTLE BAKERY DOWNTOWN.

212
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:38,000
THAT IS SO ADORABLE,BUT I DON'T THINK I CAN EAT ANOTHER BITE.

213
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,410
WELL,HERE,LET ME TAKE HALF.

214
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,010
WHAT DO YOU SAY,BREE?

215
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,420
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

216
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,730
THIS IS A LITTLE SUDDEN,ISN'T IT?

217
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,260
WE'VE ON KNOWN EACH OTHER SIX MONTHS,BUT I'VE LOVED YOU EVERY MINUTE OF IT.

218
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,220
BUT IF YOU DON'T SHARE MY FEELINGS- NO,NO.

219
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,000
I DO.

220
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,340
IT'S JUST THAT,UM,I CAN'T HELP BEING CAUTIOUS.

221
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,790
SINCE REX,I HAVEN'T BEEN EXACTLY LUCKY IN LOVE.

222
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:17,040
I USED TO FEEL THE SAME WAY.

223
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,230
WHEN ALMA LEFT ME,I WAS SHATTERED,

224
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,780
BUT I REALIZE NOW IT WAS THE LUCKIEST DAY OF MY LIFE

225
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:25,180
BECAUSE IT MEANT I WAS FREE WHEN I MET YOU.

226
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,970
LUCK CAN CHANGE,BREE.

227
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:32,510
LET ME CHANGE YOURS.

228
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:38,200
YES.

229
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,450
YES?

230
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:43,980
WHERE DOES DEPRESSION HURT?

231
00:14:08,670 --> 00:14:12,190
IAN HAINSWORTH HAD BEEN MISERABLE

232
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:19,770
EVER SINCE A TRAGIC HORSEBACK RIDING ACCIDENT HAD LEFT HIS WIFE JANE IN A COMA.

233
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:25,110
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS,HE SHIED AWAY FROM ALL SOCIAL CONTACT

234
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,680
BECAUSE HE WANTED TO BE ALONE WITH HIS GRIEF.

235
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:34,320
THEN ONE DAY,HE MET SUSAN MAYER,

236
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:41,200
WHO,BECAUSE OF HER OWN TRAGEDY,WAS JUST AS MISERABLE AS HE WAS.

237
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:47,040
AND A FRIENDSHIP SLOWLY BLOSSOMED,

238
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,850
BECAUSE AS EVERYONE KNOWS,MISERY LOVES COMPANY,

239
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,050
AND IAN WAS LOVING THIS COMPANY...

240
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,610
MORE AND MORE EVERY DAY.

241
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,760
TWO...

242
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,800
THREE-OH,ITCH,ITCH,ITCH,ITCH,ITCH.

243
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,250
DO THE NURSES KNOW YOU DO THIS?

244
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,410
OH,HEY!

245
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:14,960
UM,YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO SEE THAT.

246
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,140
WELL,CLEARLY.

247
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,920
NOW,YOU CAN BUY MY SILENCE IF YOU'LL HAVE COFFEE WITH ME.

248
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:22,080
OH,I WOULD LOVE TO,BUT I THINK I'M IN A RUSH HERE.

249
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,340
I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET MY GIRLFRIENDS FOR LUNCH AT 1:00.

250
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,090
IS IT 1:00 YET?

251
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,540
WELL,YOU TELL ME.

252
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,230
I NOTICE YOU'RE ALWAYS RUSHING INTO THE HALL TO CHECK THE TIME,SO I,UM...

253
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,100
WELL,I BOUGHT YOU THIS.

254
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,210
I- I-I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS.

255
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,330
THIS IS TOO EXTRAVAGANT.

256
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:40,360
OH,NO,IT'S NOTHING.

257
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,930
THERE WAS A GUY ON THE SIDEWALK- HAD A BUNCH OF THEM LAID OUT ON A BLANKET.

258
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,500
IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY,IT SAYS "FOLEX.

259
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:51,710
" STILL,I- xxxxxxxxxxxx

260
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,460
WELL,IN THAT CASE,THANK YOU FOR MY CHEAP KNOCKOFF.

261
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,370
OH,MY GOD.

262
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,780
I'M TE.

263
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:10,710

264
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,520

265
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,030
I'M SO SORRY I'M LATE.

266
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,920
NO,THAT'S FINE.

267
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,370
WOW,WHITE GLOVES.

268
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,940
WHAT,ARE WE HAVING LUNCHEON IN THE 1880s?

269
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,010
WELL,IT'S A VERY ELEGANT CLUB.

00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,280
YOU KNOW,ORSON'S BEEN A MEMBER HERE FOR YEARS.

271
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:29,970
IT'LL BE EVEN NICER WHEN THEY FINISH THE CONSTRUCTION.

272
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:31,790
SO YOU WERE VERY MYSTERIOUS ON THE PHONE.

273
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:33,010
WHY DID YOU WANNA HAVE LUNCH?

274
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,760
WELL,I WANTED TO INVITE YOU TO A DINNER THAT ORSON AND I ARE HAVING THIS SATURDAY.

275
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:41,160
SO YOU ASKED US TO A MEAL TO ANNOUNCE ANOTHER MEAL?

276
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,130
THAT'S SO...BREE OF YOU.

277
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:45,430
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

278
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,660
OH,UM,NO OCCASION.

279
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,590
JUST A LITTLE GET-TOGETHER.

280
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,170
WHAT ARE YOU BEING SO COY ABOUT?

281
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,940
I'M NOT BEING COY.

282
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,620
SHE SAID COYLY.

283
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,120
IF YOU DON'T TELL US,WE'RE NOT COMING.

284
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,620
OH,ALL RIGHT.

285
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:04,530
I WANTED TO WAIT AND MAKE A PROPER ANNOUNCEMENT,BUT...

286
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,120
ORSON AND I ARE ENGAGED.

287
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,510

00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:15,410
I KNOW IT'S QUICK,BUT IT JUST FEELS SO RIGHT.

291
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,890
ORSON IS JUST THE MOST WARM,WONDERFUL,GENEROUS MAN.

292
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,680
OH,GENEROUS.

293
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,440
THAT MEANS HE'S GOOD IN THE SACK.

294
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,980
ACTUALLY,UH,NO.

295
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,670
WE HAVEN'T HAD SEX YET.

296
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,140
WE'RE WAITING UNTIL WE GET MARRIED.

297
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,420
OH,MY GOD.YOU'RE SERIOUS?

298
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:41,590
NO SEX AT ALL?

299
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,880
NOT EVEN...

300
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,220
WHATEVER YOU'RE ALLUDING TO,NO.

301
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,330
BUT-BUT YOU'RE GONNA GET MARRIED.

302
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:51,750
YOU WOULDN'T BUY A CAR WITHOUT AT LEAST TAKING IT FOR A TTLE TEST DRIVE.

303
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,320
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'VE NEVER SLEPT WITH A GUY YOU WEREN'T MARRIED TO.

304
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,080
TRUE.

305
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,560
UH,I HAVE IN THE PAST GIVEN MYSELF AWAY TOO FREELY.

306
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:01,580
HOW CHARMING OF YOU TO BRING THAT UP WHILE I'M ANNOUNCING MY ENGAGEMENT.

307
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,450
BUT I LIKE TO THINK THAT I HAVE LEARNED FROM MY MISTAKES.

308
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,770
SO THE DINNER IS AT 8:00,AND WHEN WE MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENT,

309
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,900
PLEASE,EVERYBODY,LOOK SURPRISED.

310
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,660
OKAY.NO,DON'T WORRY.

311
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:15,950
I'M JUST GONNA REPLAY THE LOOK I HAD WHEN I FOUND OUT YOU HADN'T BANGED HIM YET.

312
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,890
HEY,SEXY MAMA.

313
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,550
THAT'S CUTE.

314
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,980
SO YOU INVITED KAYLA TO PARKER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY,RIGHT?

315
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,570
OF COURSE.

316
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,230
AND?

317
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,570
AND?

318
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,620
WHAT DID YOU TELL NORA?

319
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:39,890
I TOLD HER THAT WE WERE PICKING UP KAYLA FOR A QUIET AFTERNOON AT HOME.

320
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,890
YOU LIED?
YEAH,YOU'RE DAMN STRAIGHT I LIED.

321
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,430
I WILL NOT HAVE THAT LUNATIC RUINING ONE MORE FAMILY GATHERING.

322
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:48,490
BUT KAYLA'S GONNA,YOU KNOW,TELL NORA THAT WE HAD A PARTY,

323
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:51,680
AND I'M JUST AFRAID THAT NORA'S GONNA BLOW A GASKET.

324
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,470
WHAT?

325
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,380
SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING,YOU'RE MORE AFRAID OF NORA THAN YOU ARE OF ME?

326
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:01,170
IS-IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK I MEANT?

327
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,600
BECAUSE THAT IS SO NOT WHAT I MEANT.

328
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,330
YOU SCARE THE HELL OUT OF ME,BABY.

329
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,810
THANK YOU.

330
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,390
THE COFFEE MACHINE WAS BROK,SO I GOT US A COUPLE OF SMOOTHIES.

331
00:19:16,430 --> 00:19:18,180
THEY HAD STRAWBERRY AND STRAWBERRY.

332
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,710
WELL,I HATE STRAWBERRY,SO GIVE ME THE STRAWBERRY.

333
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,990
HI,JANE.

334
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,730
NOTHING - NOTHING AGAINST SMOOTHIES,

335
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,750
BUT I WOULDN'T MIND HAVING SOME REAL FOOD SOMETIME.

336
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,790
MAY-MAYBE WE COULD GO TO A RESTAURANT.

337
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:37,150

338
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,880

00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,490
THERE'S A LOVELY LITTLE BISTRO DOWN THE STREET.

341
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,310
I'M SORRY.

342
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,420
I'M REALLY,REALLY SORRY.

343
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:51,930
UH,WL,THAT SOUNDS,UH,JUST- THAT SOUNDS GREAT!

344
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,210
I MEAN,I HOPE THAT'S OKAY.

345
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,450
YEAH!

346
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,430

00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:09,750
I DID NOT LOSE OUR BABY.STOP SAYING THAT.

477
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:11,330
I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE IT IS-

478
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:16,650
INSIDE SOME CRAZY CHINESE WOMAN WHO ALSO STOLE HALF A CHICKEN FROM MY FRIDGE.

479
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,440

480
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:25,280

00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,260
XIAO-MEl CALLED ME.

489
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:44,660
SHE SAID YOU THREATENED TO SEND HER BACK TO CHINA TO WORK AS A SLAVE IN A RICE PADDY.

490
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:46,770
I...

491
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:51,170
I MAY HAVE MENTIONED DEPORTATION,BUT I DIDN'T THINK SHE'D TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

492
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,290
ARE YOU CRAZY?

493
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,920
IT WAS BANTER.

494
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:58,430
I MEAN,HAS THIS COUNTRY COME TO THE POINT WHERE YOU CAN'T JOKE WITH THE HELP?

495
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,580
YOU TREAT XIAO-MEl LIKE DIRT.

496
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,750
SHE'S JUST A POOR,INNOCENT GIRL TRYING TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM,

497
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,440
JUST LIKE YOUR ANCESTORS.

498
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,970
OH,DON'T GIVE ME THAT "WE ARE THE WORLD" CRAP.

499
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,710

521
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,560
BUT WHEN I SAW YOU STANDING IN FRONT OF THE FREEZER WITH A CLINGY SILK DRESS,

522
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:22,140
LET'S JUST SAY,WELL,THAT CHALLENGED THEM.

523
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,740
WELL,I THOUGHT WE AGREED WE WANTED OUR WEDDING NIGHT TO BE PERFECT.

524
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:28,350
YES,BUT ACTORS WANT OPENING NIGHT TO BE PERFECT.

525
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,230
THAT'S WHY THEY REHEARSE.

526
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,760
IT'LL BE BETTER THIS WAY.

527
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,940
NOW...

528
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:37,600
CAN I GET YOU SOME MORE ICE CREAM?

529
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,440
NOT IN THAT DRESS.

530
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:56,220
HI.

531
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,940
SO I NEED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

532
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:14,210
IAN,YOU KNOW,FROM ACROSS THE HALL- YOU MET HIM.

533
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,580
ANYWAY...

534
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:21,000
HE SORT OF ASKED ME OUT...

535
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:23,580
ON A DATE.

536
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:26,400
I KNOW YOU'RE THROWN.

537
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,250
I WAS THROWN,TOO.

538
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:31,160
BUT HE'S REALLY NICE,AND...

539
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:36,680
I COULD SORT OF USE SOMEONE TO TALK TO...

540
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,500
WHO ALSO TALKS BACK.

541
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,970
THE THING IS...

542
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,750
I'M SORT OF LONELY...

543
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,090
AND THE PAST SIX MONTHS HAVE BEEN REALLY HARD ON ME.

544
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,280
SO WHAT I NEED IS...

545
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:07,540
I NEED TO KNOW THAT IT'S OKAY WITH YOU IF I GO OUT WITH HIM.

546
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,150
BECAUSE IF IT'S NOT,I WON'T.

547
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:18,160
IN FACT,I'D LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN FOR YOU TO JUST WAKE UP RIGHT NOW AND TELL ME NOT TO GO OUT WITH HIM.

548
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,690
JUST WAKE UP AND TELL ME.

549
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:22,000
WAKE UP.

550
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:23,640
PLEASE!

551
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,980
ALL RIGHT.

552
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,440
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

553
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,970
I LOVE YOU.

554
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:53,450
IT IS REALLY JUST DINNER.

555
00:32:02,490 --> 00:32:05,700
I'M JUST DROPPING OFF CARLOS,AND THEN I'LL BE BY TO PICK HER UP.

556
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,460
OKAY,THANKS,EDIE.

557
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:11,180
XIAO-MEl'S FINE.

558
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,410
CRISIS AVERTED.

559
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,970
NO HARM,NO FOUL.

560
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,660
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

561
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:17,060
YOU ENDANGERED THE LIFE OF OUR BABY TODAY.

562
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,370
DON'T YOU DARE GIVE ME THAT ATTITUDE.

563
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:21,850
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THESE PAST SIX MONTHS.

564
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,170
HERE WE GO.

565
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:26,650
I HAVE HAD TO WAIT HAND AND FOOT ON YOUR MISTRESS.

566
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:29,260
I MEAN,IMAGINE IF THE DAY AFTER YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT JOHN ROWLAND,

567
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,790
YOU HAD TO MAKE HIS LUNCH AND RUB HIS FEET.

568
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,870
YEAH,WELL,JOHN ROWLAND WASN'T CARRYING OUR KID.

569
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:37,280
FORGIVE ME FOR BEING CONCERNED ABOUT OUR SURROGATE.

570
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:40,460
XIAO-MEl IS GOING TO BE FINE.

571
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:43,030
ONCE THAT BABY COMES,HER SLATE IS WIPED CLEAN.

572
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,640
SHE'S GONNA WALK AWAY,GO OFF AND LIVE HER AMERICAN DREAM.

573
00:32:46,670 --> 00:32:47,200
ME?

574
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,140
I'M GONNA BE STUCK,A SINGLE MOTHER RAISING A CHILD ALONE,

575
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,020
HAGGLING WITH LAWYERS ON WHO GETS THE KID AT CHRISTMAS.

576
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:00,320
MY AMERICAN DREAM IS OFFICIALLY DEAD.

577
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:04,670
I'M SORRY.

578
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,550
THANK YOU.

579
00:33:08,310 --> 00:33:11,840
BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,MY DREAM HASN'T EXACTLY-

580
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:23,910
OKAY,SO WE WILL SEE YOU SATURDAY,AND PLEASE PRETEND TO BE SURPRISED.

581
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:25,170
BYE.

582
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,800
YOU TOLD SOMEONE ELSE?

583
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:31,320
BREE,I THOUGHT THE WHOLE POINT OF THE PARTY WAS TO ANNOUNCE OUR ENGAGEMENT.

584
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,190
I JUST CAN'T HELP IT.

585
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,130
I LIKE TELLING PEOPLE.

586
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,850
MAKES ME FEEL...

587
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:37,380
I DON'T KNOW.

588
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,100
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M STARTING OVER.

589
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,290
IT FEELS GOOD.

590
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,340
FEELS GOOD TO ME,TOO,THOUGH.

591
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,510
AH,NO HANDS.SEE?

592
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,610
OH,YOU DON'T HAVE TO WASH THOSE.I ALREADY DID TH.

593
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:58,140
OH,I FOUND SOME STREAKS,

594
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:02,060
SO I'M WIPING THEM DOWN WITH UNDILUTED RED WINE VINEGAR.

595
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,920
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT.

596
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,020
OH,SURE.

597
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:12,010
FOR TOUGHER SPOTS,I USE A 50-50 MIX OF DENATURED ALCOHOL AND WATER.

598
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:17,870
AND FOR THOSE REALLY INTRACTABLE STAINS- I MEAN,

599
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,210
WE'RE TALKING SHOWER DOORS-

600
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,400
I WIPE ON LACQUER THINNER WITH A TOWEL.

601
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,110
BREE?

602
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,680
OH,ORSON.

603
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,110
EXCUSE ME.

604
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,340
DID YOU LOSE SOMETHING?

605
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,780
NO.

606
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:03,910
I JUST THOUGHT...

607
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,800
FOR YOU...

608
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:10,450
UM,I DON'T DO THAT.

609
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,750
WHY NOT?

610
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,580
I'M A REPUBLICAN.

611
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,000
I'M A LIBERTARIAN.

612
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:18,970
I BELIEVE IN MINIMIZING THE ROLE OF THE STATE AND MAXIMIZING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS.

613
00:35:19,010 --> 00:35:20,870
BUT,ORSON!

614
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,660
TRUST ME.

615
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:24,750
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

616
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,840
OKAY.

617
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,810
OH,NO!

618
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,060
WHAT,YOU DIDN'T JUST CRACK THAT VENEER AGAIN,DID YOU?

619
00:35:47,090 --> 00:35:48,650
I HAVE TO GO.

620
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:50,520
GO?

621
00:35:51,430 --> 00:35:53,040
GO WHERE?

622
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,250
AND THEN IT WAS LIKE SOMETHING INSIDE RUPTURED.

623
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,250
WELL,NOT SO MUCH A RUPTURE AS A SPASM.

624
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:02,380
WAVES OF THIS HOT CLUTCHING.

625
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,360
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE HAD A SMALL STROKE.

626
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,030
HOW SEVERE WERE THE PAINS?

627
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,290
WELL,THAT'S THE ODD THING.

628
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:10,080
I MEAN,THERE WAS NO PAIN PER SE.

629
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:13,480
IN FACT,IT WASN'T ENTIRELY UNPLEASANT.

630
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,700
WHAT WERE YOU DOING AT THE TIME?

631
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,630
I WAS,UH,WITH MY FIANC?

632
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:22,370
WE WERE LYING DOWN...

633
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,810
RESTING.

634
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,720
I'M GONNA TAKE A WILD SWING HERE.

635
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,200
WERE YOU HAVING SEX?

636
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,460
SORT OF.

637
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,980
MS.VAN DE KAMP,I THINK YOU MAY HAVE HAD AN ORGASM.

638
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:35,620
NO,NO,NO.

639
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,130
I HAD ORGASMS BEFORE.

640
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,950
MM,HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THEM?

641
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:43,740
OH,YOU KNOW,THAT WARM SENSATION,THAT TINGLING FEELING OF RELIEF WHEN IT'S OVER.

642
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,610
NO,NO,THIS WAS MUCH...
BETTER?

643
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,270
YES.

644
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,290
THAT'S 'CAUSE IT WAS AN ORGASM.

645
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,170
WELL,I'LL BE DARNED.

646
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,320
HI.CAN I HELP YOU?

647
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,420
ARE YOU BREE VAN DE KAMP?

648
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,020
YES,AND YOU ARE?

649
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,570
CAROLYN BIGSBY.

650
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:40,530
I WAS ORSON'S NEIGHBOR.

651
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:41,860
OH,WELL,COME ON IN.

652
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,510
LET'S DRY YOU OFF AND GET YOU A DRINK.

653
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,400
I DIDN'T COME HERE TO CELEBRATE.

654
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,660
CAROLYN.

655
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:54,880
ENGAGED AGAIN?THAT WAS QUICK WORK.

656
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:59,960
DOES SHE KNOW YOU KILLED YOUR WIFE?

657
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:03,720
MY WIFE LEFT ME.

658
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,830
AND NO ONE EVER HEARD FROM HER AGAIN.

659
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:09,720
NOT ME,NOT HER FAMILY.

660
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,820
JUST DROPPED OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH.

661
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,350
ORSON,WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

662
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,950
DIDN'T TELL YOU THAT PART,DID HE?

663
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,250
ALL RIGHT,CAROLYN,YOU'VE MADE YOUR LITTLE SCENE.

664
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:24,040
YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

665
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:26,740
DON'T LET HIM FOOL YOU.

666
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:29,640
GET AWAY FROM HIM NOW WHILE U CAN.

667
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:35,160
PLEASE LEAVE MY HOUSE.

668
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,570
FINE.

669
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,070
BE A FOOL.MARRY HIM.

670
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,320
JUST DON'T BE SURPRISED WHEN YOU GO MISSING,TOO.

671
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,710
I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO ENDURE THAT.

672
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:11,050
YOUR WIFE...

673
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,770
DISAPPEARED?

674
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,850
I TRIED TO FIND HER.

675
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:19,920
HER FAMILY CLAIMED NOT TO HAVE HEARD FROM HER.

676
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:24,790
PERSONALLY,I THINK SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO PUNISH ME.

677
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,550
ARE YOU STILL MARRIED?

678
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:33,710
NO,I WAS GRANTED A DIVORCE ON GROUNDS OF ABANDONMENT.

679
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,370
BREE...

680
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:43,060
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY THINK THAT- NO,OF COURSE NOT.

681
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,310
I LOVE YOU.

682
00:39:49,170 --> 00:39:51,200
AND I LOVE YOU.

683
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,670
ORSON...

684
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,060
MY HAND.

685
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:28,360
THE BUFFET IS OPEN.

686
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:30,790
BREE...

687
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,500
EVERY STORM BRINGS WITH IT HOPE...

688
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:05,940
THAT SOMEHOW BY MORNING,EVERYTHING WILL BE MADE CLEAN AGAIN,

689
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,720
AND EVEN THE MOST TROUBLING STAINS WILL HAVE DISAPPEARED,

690
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:14,630
LIKE THE DOUBTS OVER HIS INNOCENCE...

691
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:21,560
OR THE CONSEQUENCE OF HIS MISTAKE.

692
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:29,090
LIKE THE SCARS OF HIS BETRAYAL...

693
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:38,590
OR THE MEMORY OF HIS KISS.

694
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:46,980
SO WE WAIT FOR THE STORM TO PASS,HOPING FORHE BEST.

695
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:50,400
coming soon...
our new pro shop

696
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,660
EVEN THOUGH WE KNOW IN OUR HEARTS...

697
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:00,240
