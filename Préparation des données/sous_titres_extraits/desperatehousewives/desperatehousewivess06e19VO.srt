00:00:00,166 --> 00:00:01,960
<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,432 --> 00:00:05,880
- <i>Gaby learned a secret.</i>
- Lee and I are trying to adopt a baby.

3
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,735
<i>Mike made a commitment.</i>

4
00:00:07,902 --> 00:00:10,594
I can be a guy who
takes care of his family.

5
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,258
<i>Lynette was warned.</i>

6
00:00:13,137 --> 00:00:15,638
I told Preston I want to
move up wedding to next week.

7
00:00:15,805 --> 00:00:17,058
Next week?

8
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:19,730
<i>A killer put everyone on edge.</i>

9
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,355
- Can't believe she is dead.
- I gotta go home,

10
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:25,609
my mom was so freaked out. It could've
been me, so she wants me around.

11
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,570
- So you're my brother?
- Half-brother, to be precise.

12
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:31,823
- <i>Suspicious was born.</i>
- What do we really know about Sam?

13
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:35,535
- I should find out everything I can.
- Why shouldn't you? He's your brother.

14
00:00:35,932 --> 00:00:37,996
<i>And a very dangerous man</i>

15
00:00:38,395 --> 00:00:40,752
<i>arrived on Wisteria Lane.</i>

16
00:00:47,151 --> 00:00:48,644
<i>Good neighbors...</i>

17
00:00:49,593 --> 00:00:51,818
<i>They loan you cups of sugar...</i>

18
00:00:53,432 --> 00:00:56,324
<i>They tell you why
your car won't start...</i>

19
00:00:57,902 --> 00:01:00,992
<i>They even help you
find your lost pets.</i>

20
00:01:03,444 --> 00:01:05,465
<i>Good neighbors also come over</i>

21
00:01:05,632 --> 00:01:08,321
<i>at the slightest hint of trouble...</i>

22
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:12,363
Whether you want 'em there or not.

23
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,732
- <i>I'm tired of fighting about this.</i>
- <i>Fine. Walk away.</i>

24
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:17,650
<i>It's what you always do.</i>

25
00:01:20,808 --> 00:01:22,357
Gaby, what are you doing?

26
00:01:24,024 --> 00:01:27,553
I came to return
this magazine Lee lent me, but,

27
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,631
you two were arguing, so...

28
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,050
So you decided it would
be fun to eavesdrop?

29
00:01:33,097 --> 00:01:35,926
It's like you see into my soul,
and yet you don't judge.

30
00:01:36,093 --> 00:01:37,093
Thank you.

31
00:01:39,665 --> 00:01:41,518
Come on. Tell me what happened.

32
00:01:43,613 --> 00:01:45,063
Our egg donor backed out.

33
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:46,690
Not again.

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,303
And our surrogate we hired
will pull out if the procedure

35
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,195
- isn't done in the next month.
- Can't you find another egg donor?

36
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:56,241
- We could, if Lee wasn't so picky.
- Why are you discussing this with her?

37
00:01:57,024 --> 00:01:59,017
For God sakes, I was
eavesdropping. Catch up.

38
00:01:59,184 --> 00:02:02,076
Okay, yeah, I'm picky.
We spent two years choosing a mattress.

39
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:04,916
I'm not just gonna get our child's DNA
out of the yellow pages.

40
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,067
If we lose the surrogate, it could
take months to find another one.

41
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:10,974
And then she'll drop
out for some ridiculous reason,

42
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:13,007
and I can't take any more of this!

43
00:02:15,038 --> 00:02:16,842
Maybe we're not
supposed to be parents.

44
00:02:17,009 --> 00:02:18,226
Don't talk like that!

45
00:02:18,393 --> 00:02:21,433
Come on! Doesn't it seem like the
universe is trying to tell us something?

46
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,143
Why not take mine?

47
00:02:24,271 --> 00:02:25,437
Take your what?

48
00:02:25,844 --> 00:02:26,855
My eggs.

49
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:31,140
I mean, I've got plenty, and,

50
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,685
I hate to see you guys so unhappy.

51
00:02:33,852 --> 00:02:35,202
So what the heck?

52
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:39,448
<i>Good neighbors...
they're people who try to help others.</i>

53
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,203
<i>Bad neighbors are
people who make promises</i>

54
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:47,401
<i>they can't possibly keep.</i>

57
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:02,281
<i>The morning paper said
a young girl was missing.</i>

58
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:04,340
<i>It quoted her family,</i>

59
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:07,565
<i>who said she had vanished
on her way to work.</i>

60
00:03:08,848 --> 00:03:10,242
<i>It quoted her friends,</i>

61
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:13,813
<i>who said she wasn't the type
to run away from home.</i>

62
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,147
<i>It quoted the police,</i>

63
00:03:17,314 --> 00:03:20,613
<i>who said they had
very little evidence to go on.</i>

64
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:22,920
<i>Sadly,</i>

65
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,814
<i>people didn't pay much
attention to this bit of news.</i>

66
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:32,825
<i>No one thinks about evil</i>

67
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:36,573
<i>until it shows up on their doorstep,</i>

68
00:03:37,477 --> 00:03:39,290
<i>which it soon would.</i>

69
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:51,189
Oh, my God. Thief!

70
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:53,858
You!

71
00:03:54,298 --> 00:03:56,611
- Freeze!
- Lady, put that thing down.

72
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,190
While I'm at it,
why don't I just hand you the keys?

73
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:00,740
Now hit the dirt!

74
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:03,952
Relax. I'm not stealing anything.
This is a repossession.

75
00:04:04,473 --> 00:04:05,867
Do I look stupid to you?

76
00:04:06,034 --> 00:04:08,748
- Fire! Fire!
- What the hell are you doing?

77
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,339
People come quicker
when you yell "Fire."

78
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:14,420
Now I believe I told
you to hit the dirt!

79
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:17,757
- Where's the fire?
- Susan, you okay?

80
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,901
I'm fine. Just call 9-1-1!

81
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,741
What's going on?

82
00:04:21,908 --> 00:04:24,389
This thief
is trying to steal your truck!

83
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,058
You're the guy who's four months
behind on his payments?

84
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:32,580
Stop, drop and roll!

85
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,028
Stop, drop and roll!

86
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:41,865
Why didn't you tell me you
were having money problems?

87
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,458
I was hoping business would
pick up before anybody found out.

88
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,831
But I guess that's
no longer an option.

89
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:55,169
We talked about this.
I told you, I am willing to help.

90
00:04:55,419 --> 00:04:57,547
And I told you,
I'm not taking my wife's money.

91
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,716
Enough with the macho pride.

92
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,634
I make a steady paycheck,

93
00:05:02,214 --> 00:05:05,096
and I have all that money
from selling Karl's strip club.

94
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:08,978
I'm definitely not taking your
ex-husband's money. Are we done here?

95
00:05:09,145 --> 00:05:12,476
Sure. As long as you can explain how
you're going to run a plumbing business

96
00:05:12,643 --> 00:05:13,730
without a truck.

97
00:05:15,158 --> 00:05:17,191
I don't know. I'll figure it out.

98
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:25,357
And for the cover of the book,
I see you in an evening gown,

99
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:28,019
sitting on a bale of hay,
ringing a dinner bell.

100
00:05:28,186 --> 00:05:30,622
I love it. Such a sense of whimsy.

101
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,959
If it isn't the dynamic duo. How did
your meeting with the publisher go?

102
00:05:35,667 --> 00:05:36,765
Fantastic.

103
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:39,849
Bruce loved the idea
of a nouvelle Southern cookbook.

104
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:43,301
And your brother came up
with the marketing slogan in the room.

105
00:05:44,566 --> 00:05:45,720
Tell him, Sam.

106
00:05:46,106 --> 00:05:47,357
"Mrs. Van De Kamp

107
00:05:47,524 --> 00:05:50,835
introduces you to upscale
down-home cuisine."

108
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,184
Catchy.

109
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:56,105
I guess you know all about marketing,
having an MBA and all.

110
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:57,815
I guess so.

111
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:01,937
Except, of course, you
don't actually have an MBA.

112
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:05,787
What are you talking about?

113
00:06:05,954 --> 00:06:08,326
I made a few calls,
checked a few records.

114
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:12,175
Turns out the golden child
never got his degree.

115
00:06:14,445 --> 00:06:15,609
Is this true?

116
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:19,295
Yes. I'm a few classes short.

117
00:06:20,258 --> 00:06:22,465
- Is one of them Ethics?
- Andrew, please.

118
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:26,594
I don't understand.

119
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,040
It was the final semester.

120
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:32,593
We were about two months in

121
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,358
when the doctor told me
my mother was terminal.

122
00:06:35,525 --> 00:06:36,877
I left school

123
00:06:37,044 --> 00:06:40,274
and brought her home so she didn't
have to die in the hospital.

124
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:42,902
If you like,

125
00:06:43,725 --> 00:06:47,158
I can save you a phone call
and bring in her death certificate.

126
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,452
That's okay.

127
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,456
The university let me
graduate with my class.

128
00:06:55,802 --> 00:06:58,292
I should finish my
coursework next month.

129
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:01,504
But I'm sorry, Bree.
I should not have misrepresented myself.

130
00:07:03,884 --> 00:07:06,315
Everyone steps over
the line now and then.

131
00:07:06,482 --> 00:07:08,564
Let's all make an effort not to,

132
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,240
shall we?

133
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,320
This woman is incompetent.

134
00:07:23,789 --> 00:07:25,156
Why you bring me here?

135
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:27,905
You're the one who had to
come to a Russian bridal shop.

136
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:30,495
It was mistake.

137
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,050
Look at the fun you're having chewing
people out in your native tongue.

138
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,627
Sorry for the way she's
been talking to you.

139
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:46,041
Don't worry. You're not losing a son.
You are gaining a pain in the ass.

140
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:49,778
Tell me about it. My son is
marrying a woman he barely knows.

141
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:51,929
He's making the biggest
mistake of his life,

142
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:54,057
and I am powerless to stop him.

143
00:07:54,657 --> 00:07:57,935
If you like, maybe I get
a little sloppy with the pushpins.

144
00:07:58,728 --> 00:07:59,729
You're sweet.

145
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,816
Irina? It's your phone.

146
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:07,779
If it's Preston,
tell him I be home soon.

147
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:10,641
Okay, your highness.

148
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,240
Bride's phone.

149
00:08:15,025 --> 00:08:16,101
Slow down.

150
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:20,046
I don't speak Russian.
Irina, it's some Russian guy,

151
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:21,834
and he doesn't sound happy.

152
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:25,203
Alexei...

153
00:08:31,801 --> 00:08:32,956
Who was that?

154
00:08:33,325 --> 00:08:34,573
Wrong number.

155
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,349
He asked for you by name.

156
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:40,429
If I wanted you to know,
I would say it in English.

157
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:42,855
Missus?

158
00:08:45,598 --> 00:08:47,401
I can say it in English.

159
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:56,025
Double cappuccino, extra hot.

160
00:08:57,555 --> 00:08:58,913
Need anything else?

161
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:01,499
Inspiration.

162
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:04,877
Sorry. We just have muffins.

163
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:08,923
What are you working on?

164
00:09:09,908 --> 00:09:10,922
A novel.

165
00:09:11,457 --> 00:09:13,714
I know, another guy in a coffee shop
writing a novel.

166
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,221
Just what the world needs.

167
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,962
No, I think it's cool.

168
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:18,850
Mind if I ask what it's about?

169
00:09:20,504 --> 00:09:21,978
You really wanna know?

170
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:23,396
I do.

171
00:09:24,923 --> 00:09:26,774
It started out as a love story,

172
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:29,703
but it's getting kind of dark.

173
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:32,799
This guy meets this girl,

174
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,191
takes her from nothing,

175
00:09:35,752 --> 00:09:37,326
gives her life meaning.

176
00:09:38,292 --> 00:09:39,892
Basically creates her.

177
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:43,314
Then one day,

178
00:09:44,184 --> 00:09:45,784
she just disappears...

179
00:09:46,626 --> 00:09:47,676
vanishes...

180
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,047
with another man.

181
00:09:50,835 --> 00:09:52,091
Sucks for the guy.

182
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:54,594
And she takes his baby.

183
00:09:56,117 --> 00:09:57,805
She sounds like a bitch.

184
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:59,399
Sure does.

185
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:02,685
Anyhow, I'm up to the point

186
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,627
where the guy who's been
looking for her for a long time

187
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:07,576
finally tracks her down.

188
00:10:10,537 --> 00:10:12,612
And that's where I'm kind of stuck.

189
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:16,706
What does he do?

190
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:20,912
I don't know all the details,

191
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,017
but you said it was dark, right?

192
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:29,695
Seems to me the guy would kill her.

193
00:10:31,101 --> 00:10:34,001
Funny. That was exactly
my first instinct, too.

194
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,475
You asked my permission to be
an egg donor, and I said "No."

195
00:10:42,891 --> 00:10:45,233
I wasn't asking you.
I was telling you.

196
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:48,856
Sorry. You can't do this without
my approval. Those eggs are half mine.

197
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,622
- How so?
- I'm your husband.

198
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:52,860
I own 50% of whatever
comes out of that uterus.

199
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,918
So you think you own my body.

200
00:10:57,944 --> 00:11:00,471
I pay for the clothes it wears,
the massages it receives

201
00:11:00,638 --> 00:11:02,495
and the implants it will
one day require.

202
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:05,214
If I don't own it, I'm at
least a major stockholder.

203
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,818
Which means I can stop you
from handing out your eggs

204
00:11:07,985 --> 00:11:10,711
like party favors to every childless
gay couple that wanders by.

205
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:14,375
You cannot stop me. I can do
whatever I want with my eggs.

206
00:11:14,542 --> 00:11:17,049
And I can do whatever I want
with the credit cards I pay for.

207
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:18,719
For example, I can cut them up.

208
00:11:19,189 --> 00:11:23,193
I don't care about credit cards.
I am trying to do something noble here.

209
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,960
I'm helping these
people become a family.

210
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:29,855
- You've hidden the cards, haven't you?
- Damn straight.

211
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:33,734
I am begging you, as your husband,

212
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:35,974
please don't do this.

213
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,004
It'll be too weird having
your DNA living next door.

214
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:42,531
I don't care. My mind is made up. I am
going to help Bob and Lee have a baby

215
00:11:42,698 --> 00:11:44,683
so they can experience
the same love and joy

216
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,331
that we occasionally
have with our children.

217
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:53,087
So the Russian salesgirl
translated for me, and,

218
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,725
you'll never guess
what Irina said to the...

219
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,425
angry guy on the phone.

220
00:11:58,694 --> 00:12:00,219
Please don't make me guess.

221
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:03,627
She said,
"Go ahead and call the police.

222
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:05,888
You'll never find me."

223
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,436
And that's it?

224
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:11,410
How much more do you need?

225
00:12:11,577 --> 00:12:14,435
She is a foreigner.
She's done something criminal.

226
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:16,277
Start your deportation now.

227
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:19,508
Without proof of criminal activity,
there's nothing I can do.

228
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:21,429
Can't you at least...

229
00:12:22,313 --> 00:12:23,515
interrogate her?

230
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:28,039
And, if you wanna slap her around a bit,
you'll get no complaints from me.

231
00:12:28,492 --> 00:12:31,072
Look Mrs. Scavo, we
are a government agency.

232
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:33,610
We can't investigate your
future daughter-in-law

233
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:36,380
just because you don't think
she's good for your son.

234
00:12:40,682 --> 00:12:43,429
It all makes sense now.
You're single. Never had any kids?

235
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:44,861
Yeah. So?

236
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:46,884
You just don't get it.

237
00:12:59,787 --> 00:13:02,114
Nice-looking family.
Is that your daughter-in-law?

238
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,035
You two get along?

239
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,245
Don't get me started.

240
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:11,452
Got a minute?

241
00:13:18,145 --> 00:13:21,050
- MJ, what are you doin'?
- Clogging the sink.

242
00:13:21,515 --> 00:13:22,515
What?

243
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:24,032
Daddy needs work.

244
00:13:25,792 --> 00:13:27,328
Honey, that's sweet,

245
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,559
but daddy only gets paid when
other people have plumbing problems.

246
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:34,271
So I should do this
to somebody else's sink?

247
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:35,771
No, honey.

248
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:37,859
That would be wrong.

249
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:48,188
I'm having a problem
with Mike and his male ego.

250
00:13:48,355 --> 00:13:50,840
Long story short...
Can I clog your drain?

251
00:13:55,104 --> 00:13:57,379
So don't phone Mike
until I get home.

252
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,472
And when you call him,
sound desperate.

253
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,414
That way, he'll feel useful.

254
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:08,993
But don't call till Saturday.
He gets double time on weekends.

255
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:16,597
There's enough there for a tip,
but careful when you give it to him.

256
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:19,603
I don't want him thinking
anyone's doing him a favor.

257
00:14:21,562 --> 00:14:25,030
Trust me, Bruce. After they taste
these recipes, they will be onboard.

258
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,780
Just give me
the chance to dazzle them.

259
00:14:30,169 --> 00:14:31,255
Problems?

260
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:33,962
Bruce got a little resistance
when he met with the sales team.

261
00:14:34,129 --> 00:14:36,528
They fear Southern
cookbooks are a tad overdone.

262
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:38,894
So I suggested we have
a little dinner

263
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:41,589
- to let them sample the recipes.
- Excellent.

264
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,832
We have to impress them. Let's see if
we can book the private dining room

265
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,733
- at the Britannian hotel.
- I'll take care of it.

266
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,258
But before I do,

267
00:14:49,425 --> 00:14:51,640
I have somethin difficult to say.

268
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:54,917
I hope it's not about
that silly MBA business.

269
00:14:55,355 --> 00:14:57,897
I think I know why Andrew
tried to discredit me yesterday.

270
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:03,095
He knew you had me
auditing the books, and,

271
00:15:03,481 --> 00:15:05,196
he knew what I was gonna find.

272
00:15:05,755 --> 00:15:06,989
What did you find?

273
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,455
Did you charge the Donellys
for five cases of vodka?

274
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:17,513
Yeah. So?

275
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,690
According to our invoices,
only four were delivered to their party.

276
00:15:20,857 --> 00:15:23,533
And the Rotary Club Luncheon was
charged for seven cases of wine,

277
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,350
and only six showed up.

278
00:15:25,602 --> 00:15:27,488
Why are
you even looking at this stuff?

279
00:15:27,655 --> 00:15:30,661
And I seem to recall
you having a party that same weekend,

280
00:15:30,828 --> 00:15:33,224
with lots of wine and lots of vodka.

281
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,644
I took some leftover booze to my house
for a party. What's the big deal?

282
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,939
It wasn't leftover. You charged
the client for that. That's stealing.

283
00:15:41,457 --> 00:15:44,360
- Is Sam told you about this?
- We're not talking about Sam right now.

284
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,736
But we need to.

285
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,551
Can't you see
the type of person he is?

286
00:15:49,718 --> 00:15:51,982
Yes, he is the type of
person who leaves college

287
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:55,496
to care for his dying mother. You're the
type of person who steals from clients.

288
00:15:57,727 --> 00:16:01,116
Believe what you wanna believe,
but I'm not gonna listen to this.

289
00:16:05,074 --> 00:16:06,549
Don't you walk away from me!

290
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,031
Can't you see how
he's manipulating you?

291
00:16:09,198 --> 00:16:12,721
- How stupid can you be?
- Stupid enough to have trusted you.

292
00:16:12,971 --> 00:16:14,932
If I'm the problem,
why not just fire me?

293
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,101
I'm tempted. Don't push me.

294
00:16:25,924 --> 00:16:28,674
Clear your things out
and turn in your keys.

295
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,604
<i>Did Irina and Preston say when
they'd be back from the mall?</i>

296
00:16:46,771 --> 00:16:47,771
Stop!

297
00:16:48,318 --> 00:16:49,491
Stop what?

298
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,575
Not you.
I'm teaching Parker to drive.

299
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:57,766
I'm planning to steal
Irina's passport number.

300
00:16:58,361 --> 00:16:59,810
What are you up to now?

301
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,397
I have a new friend at immigration who's
got a friend at the Russian embassy

302
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:06,447
who's agreed to initiate
a background search.

303
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,694
This is getting out of hand.

304
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:11,905
That woman is hiding something,
and I am taking her down.

305
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,187
Come on.

306
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,605
We shouldn't be in here with the door
closed.

307
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:50,486
My mom gets a little freaked out.

308
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,321
Your mother is a prude.

309
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,324
That is what happens to women
when they grow old.

310
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,674
Now kiss me.

311
00:18:06,184 --> 00:18:08,045
- Who's that?
- Your mom.

312
00:18:08,579 --> 00:18:09,973
"Get home now.

313
00:18:10,376 --> 00:18:12,895
Trapped behind the closet door.

314
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:15,184
Preston and Irina are about to..."

315
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,389
Pull over. I gotta get home fast.

316
00:18:18,947 --> 00:18:20,147
I can go fast.

317
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,064
Seriously, my mom's in the house.

318
00:18:27,538 --> 00:18:29,900
I know.
Is what make it fun.

319
00:18:57,091 --> 00:19:00,764
Honey maple short ribs
drizzled with manzanilla Sherry.

320
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,500
These are amazing.

321
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:07,479
Bruce's sales team will
be powerless to resist.

322
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,316
You are really focused on this dinner,
it's amazing considering what happened.

323
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,574
I mean... Firing your own son.

324
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:17,948
I've done worse things to Andrew.

325
00:19:18,867 --> 00:19:21,493
We have a very
complicated relationship.

326
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,204
You'll see that
the longer you're at the company.

327
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:27,463
How? You fired him.

328
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,817
That's just our pattern.
He provokes me, and I push him away,

329
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:33,134
but we always come back together.

330
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:36,759
So...
You're going to bring him back in?

331
00:19:37,422 --> 00:19:38,472
Eventually.

332
00:19:38,639 --> 00:19:40,089
But the stealing...

333
00:19:40,428 --> 00:19:42,389
and the way he spoke to you...

334
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:43,994
He's my son.

335
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,908
- Busy day, huh?
- Yeah, busy week.

336
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,655
It's so funny. I've had
all this work right here on the lane.

337
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,659
That's good, right? Especially
since you don't have your truck.

338
00:20:06,717 --> 00:20:07,873
Guess what I found?

339
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,419
My earring. I'm looking all over
for that. Where'd you find it?

340
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:14,296
Gaby's bathtub drain.

341
00:20:20,573 --> 00:20:22,303
Of course.

342
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:24,940
Gaby and I went jogging, and...

343
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,809
then I hugged her.

344
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,207
So my earring probably got
caught in... in her...

345
00:20:31,614 --> 00:20:33,857
sports bra, and when she went to...

346
00:20:34,456 --> 00:20:37,611
take a bath...
Do you wanna have sex?

347
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,324
So Gaby's drain, Angie's
garbage disposal, Lynette's toilet...

348
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:45,111
I mean, the really dirty sex.

349
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,748
So now I have to return
all that money.

350
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,900
No, you don't.

351
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:53,794
I...

352
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:57,005
gave it to them.

353
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,844
You're saying everyone on the street
knows I'm having financial trouble?

354
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,012
Well... I think they
already figured that out

355
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:09,268
When they saw your truck
get repossessed out of our driveway.

356
00:21:09,724 --> 00:21:11,311
This is humiliating, Susan.

357
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,069
I'm sorry, but it all
could've been prevented

358
00:21:14,236 --> 00:21:17,359
if you'd just let me make a few
stupid payments on your truck.

359
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,570
I told you, I don't want your help.

360
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,947
This is my business, my problem.

361
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:25,826
You know, I don't remember
all those "Mys" in our wedding vows.

362
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,344
It's supposed to be a partnership.
If you can't let me help you,

363
00:21:29,511 --> 00:21:31,605
maybe there's something wrong
with our marriage.

364
00:21:31,772 --> 00:21:34,213
I'm not gonna listen to this,
all right? I'm tired.

365
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,530
I had a busy day wasting my time.

366
00:21:37,056 --> 00:21:38,714
I'll sleep on the couch.

367
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,410
You up there?

368
00:22:47,877 --> 00:22:49,677
Jeez, Nick, you scared me.

369
00:22:50,594 --> 00:22:54,044
Nothing. I just got home,
and I thought I heard a noise...

370
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:55,411
No, it's fine.

371
00:22:56,172 --> 00:22:57,772
Just hurry home, okay?

372
00:23:09,467 --> 00:23:11,560
To Gabrielle Solis,
the best neighbor

373
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:14,184
Two childless, upwardly mobile
gay guys could ever have.

374
00:23:16,143 --> 00:23:17,143
I got it.

375
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,357
No, that was purely ceremonial.
We don't want you drinking.

376
00:23:20,737 --> 00:23:22,442
Why? Does it affect my fertility?

377
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:25,570
That,
and you're kind of a sloppy drunk.

378
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,980
Fine. Let's talk babies.

379
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,869
So... What are you guys
hoping for... a boy or a girl?

380
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:36,665
I want a girl. That way, we can
put her in baby beauty pageants.

381
00:23:37,002 --> 00:23:40,127
They're so cute in their makeup
and rhinestone dresses.

382
00:23:40,793 --> 00:23:43,630
- Really? You guys gonna do that?
- Why not?

383
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,830
It's just I kind of dabbled in that
world and for me, it was a bit much.

384
00:23:46,997 --> 00:23:49,166
Don't panic. 50% chance it's a boy.

385
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:51,263
Then it's makeup
and rhinestone vests.

386
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:53,702
- What?!
- He's kidding.

387
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,602
He better be.
There's no way I'm allowing that.

388
00:24:00,043 --> 00:24:03,442
Now that I think about it,
I do hope we have a boy.

389
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:05,861
And why is that?

390
00:24:06,514 --> 00:24:09,239
I already have two girls.
I'm so sick of buying dresses.

391
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:13,493
When he's old enough, I'm gonna take him
on the biggest shopping spree ever.

392
00:24:17,825 --> 00:24:20,292
I guess you can do that
when we come back to visit.

393
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,410
- Visit? Where are you going?
- My mother lives in upstate New York.

394
00:24:23,577 --> 00:24:26,882
We thought we'd move closer to her
So the baby can be around family.

395
00:24:28,594 --> 00:24:29,594
Really?

396
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,429
Is that a problem?

397
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:37,559
It just never occurred to me you guys
would leave and take my only son.

398
00:24:43,395 --> 00:24:45,525
This child, it'll have your genes,

399
00:24:46,198 --> 00:24:47,798
but it won't be yours.

400
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:49,571
You get that, right?

401
00:24:57,912 --> 00:24:58,912
Of course.

402
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:03,668
I mean,
it's the only way it can work, right?

403
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,559
Come on. You ready?

404
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:15,875
Okay, no peeking.

405
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:20,132
You gonna beat me again this time?

406
00:25:27,642 --> 00:25:29,486
Mommy, why do you look so sad?

407
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:35,328
Well, I was just thinking about
what it would be like

408
00:25:35,495 --> 00:25:38,245
if I couldn't see your face every day,
and it made me sad.

409
00:25:40,184 --> 00:25:41,484
What's going on?

410
00:25:46,313 --> 00:25:48,013
Come out of the kitchen.

411
00:25:48,451 --> 00:25:51,002
I want you to spend some time
with these people. Mingle.

412
00:25:51,169 --> 00:25:52,169
Have a drink.

413
00:25:52,336 --> 00:25:54,145
I don't drink, Bruce.
I'm an alcoholic.

414
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:57,069
One drink. I'm not asking you
to swing from the chandelier.

415
00:25:57,236 --> 00:25:58,886
Why are you so nervous?

416
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:04,993
I really put my neck
on the line for this book, Bree.

417
00:26:05,437 --> 00:26:07,524
No one likes the idea. No one.

418
00:26:09,073 --> 00:26:10,986
I should've stopped
at just one drink.

419
00:26:11,356 --> 00:26:13,606
Look, they are gonna love the food.

420
00:26:13,904 --> 00:26:16,449
I hope so, because if they don't,

421
00:26:16,699 --> 00:26:20,412
I don't see how you're going
to publish another book of any kind.

422
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,520
Hop to, people. This is a big one.

423
00:26:35,226 --> 00:26:37,387
- Something wrong?
- What's this?

424
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,437
It's the Sherry
we drizzle on the ribs.

425
00:26:39,604 --> 00:26:41,349
This isn't Sherry. This is vinegar.

426
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:42,599
Vinegar?

427
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:53,319
It's ruined.

428
00:26:55,841 --> 00:26:57,983
They're all ruined. It's disgusting!

429
00:26:58,775 --> 00:27:00,727
The floor's not looking
so great either.

430
00:27:00,894 --> 00:27:02,709
Stop! We can't serve this food.

431
00:27:02,876 --> 00:27:04,802
We've already taken out
most of the plates.

432
00:27:04,969 --> 00:27:07,189
Don't just stand there.
Go get them back.

433
00:27:07,356 --> 00:27:08,585
How can it be vinegar?

434
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:11,087
We tested the recipe last
night, and it was perfect,

435
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,454
and then I locked the Sherry
in the liquor cabinet.

436
00:27:13,621 --> 00:27:15,842
Who had access?
Did you give Andrew's keys to anyone

437
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:18,387
- after you fired him?
- He never returned his key.

438
00:27:20,763 --> 00:27:22,343
They won't give the plates back.

439
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:25,510
The publisher guy's giving a little
speech, and then they're gonna eat.

440
00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:28,677
I am not gonna lose
my cookbook career over this.

441
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:43,097
Hand me that torch.

442
00:27:45,228 --> 00:27:46,778
<i>Bon apétit</i> everybody!

443
00:28:03,144 --> 00:28:06,662
We're serving cobbler
in the parking lot!

444
00:28:17,155 --> 00:28:19,405
I just made you real hot chocolate.

445
00:28:19,858 --> 00:28:21,241
Don't I get a smile?

446
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,440
My son tried
to ruin my career tonight.

447
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:27,831
I don't think I'll ever smile again.

448
00:28:29,046 --> 00:28:33,044
Honestly, I don't think Andrew
had anything to do with it.

449
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:35,391
You don't?

450
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:38,379
Look at the planning
that went into it.

451
00:28:38,546 --> 00:28:41,621
The vinegar had to be
substituted for the Sherry

452
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,634
after you'd selected the bottle

453
00:28:43,801 --> 00:28:46,094
But before you'd left for the event.

454
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:49,227
And the ingredient had to be
something you wouldn't sample.

455
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:54,530
Come on. Andrew's not clever
enough to pull that off.

456
00:28:54,697 --> 00:28:57,354
He can't even steal a case of wine
without getting caught.

457
00:28:57,521 --> 00:28:59,154
Well, then who do you think did it?

458
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:03,000
Well, it'd have to be
somebody pretty smart...

459
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:06,619
at least smart enough to get an MBA.

460
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:10,623
Sam? That's ridiculous.
Why would he want to hurt me?

461
00:29:11,252 --> 00:29:13,302
Who said he wanted to hurt you?

462
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:15,920
Andrew's the one taking this fall.

463
00:29:17,545 --> 00:29:20,967
No, that's not possible.
What does he stand to gain?

464
00:29:22,682 --> 00:29:24,232
What a good question.

465
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:27,114
Enjoy your chocolate.

466
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,647
Every once in a while, I catch Susan
looking at me this certain way.

467
00:29:36,814 --> 00:29:39,443
You know, I'm putting on my shirt or

468
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:41,579
mowing the lawn. I'll turn my head,

469
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:44,157
and I'll catch her with
this look in her eyes,

470
00:29:44,635 --> 00:29:47,885
and I know she's thinking
that she's lucky to have me.

471
00:29:51,843 --> 00:29:54,243
So how can I tell her
I'm dead broke?

472
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:58,899
How can I say,
"I can't take your money,

473
00:29:59,066 --> 00:30:01,199
because it won't begin to cover

474
00:30:01,481 --> 00:30:04,531
the debts I've been racking up
for the last year"?

475
00:30:05,157 --> 00:30:07,857
She thinks
it's a couple of truck payments.

476
00:30:08,772 --> 00:30:10,172
She's got no idea.

477
00:30:11,303 --> 00:30:13,499
This would really hurt her.

478
00:30:14,493 --> 00:30:16,893
If she found out
I kept this from her,

479
00:30:17,696 --> 00:30:20,946
I don't think I'd ever see
that look from her again...

480
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:24,123
And I can't let that happen.

481
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:27,909
Tell me how much you need.

482
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,420
Double capp, extra hot, right?

483
00:30:40,518 --> 00:30:41,548
Good memory.

484
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,342
I haven't seen you for a while.
I thought maybe you left town.

485
00:30:45,816 --> 00:30:47,804
I'm not leaving
till I finish my book.

486
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,641
Right, yeah. How's that goin'?

487
00:30:50,952 --> 00:30:52,225
Did the guy kill her?

488
00:30:55,321 --> 00:30:56,813
I tried to write it that way.

489
00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:00,483
He went over there. She was alone.

490
00:31:03,091 --> 00:31:04,491
He had the chance.

491
00:31:06,181 --> 00:31:07,407
And what happened?

492
00:31:09,886 --> 00:31:11,436
Just seemed too easy.

493
00:31:15,028 --> 00:31:16,458
So you stuck again?

494
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,336
I've got a better idea.

495
00:31:23,005 --> 00:31:26,509
If you think about it, the worst part of
what she did was taking the kid, right?

496
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:29,879
So...

497
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:31,473
I figure...

498
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,590
the best way for him
to get revenge...

499
00:31:36,016 --> 00:31:37,937
is to take something from her.

500
00:31:38,433 --> 00:31:41,858
But what could he take that's
gonna be as bad as what she did?

501
00:31:45,594 --> 00:31:46,594
The kid.

502
00:31:47,983 --> 00:31:51,583
- He's gonna take the kid, right?
- That's what I'm thinking.

503
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,383
So, I guess
Carlos talk to you, guys.

504
00:32:08,556 --> 00:32:09,556
He did.

505
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:13,461
I feel awful.

506
00:32:14,793 --> 00:32:17,393
The more he thought about it,
he just couldn't let me do this.

507
00:32:17,643 --> 00:32:19,620
And let's face it,
he does have a say.

508
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:22,482
It's completely understandable,
Gaby. It was a lot to ask.

509
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:26,986
So where's Lee?
I wanna talk to him, too.

510
00:32:28,518 --> 00:32:29,518
He left.

511
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,159
Left?

512
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:38,347
After Carlos came over, Lee and I
got into yet another fight, and...

513
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,792
we broke up.

514
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,381
Are you kidding me?

515
00:32:47,353 --> 00:32:49,803
Lee says he can't go
through it again.

516
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:52,020
I'm determined to have a child,

517
00:32:52,563 --> 00:32:53,563
so...

518
00:32:57,258 --> 00:32:58,977
Is there anything I can do?

519
00:33:02,969 --> 00:33:03,969
Right.

520
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,479
Sorry.

521
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:09,068
It's okay, Gaby.
Like I said, it was a lot to ask.

522
00:33:27,289 --> 00:33:29,424
- My left shoe is missing.
- We'll find it.

523
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,992
- I can't get married in one shoe.
- Just get dressed.

524
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,236
The wedding starts in half an hour.

525
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:37,640
Maybe he should wear sneakers. It'd be
wild, like he's too cool to care.

526
00:33:39,707 --> 00:33:41,851
Or I could...
I just help him keep looking.

527
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:43,168
There you go.

528
00:33:44,406 --> 00:33:46,506
Help me look for Preston's shoe!

529
00:33:56,441 --> 00:33:57,577
What are you doing?

530
00:33:58,701 --> 00:34:01,183
I need your help.
Preston can't find his shoe.

531
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:02,749
I put it in the oven.

532
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,042
Why?

533
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:08,023
Because that woman at immigration
never called me back,

534
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,540
and I am screwed.

535
00:34:11,897 --> 00:34:13,735
Come on, hiding a shoe

536
00:34:13,902 --> 00:34:15,974
isn't gonna stop them
from getting married.

537
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:18,343
I know.
I just wanted a few more minutes

538
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:21,910
before I had to tell my son
I'm not going to his wedding.

539
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:24,609
I will not be a hypocrite, Tom.

540
00:34:25,205 --> 00:34:27,113
I know how you feel.

541
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,658
But if you thin
Irina's got power now,

542
00:34:29,825 --> 00:34:33,375
just you wait until you don't
show up to your son's wedding.

543
00:34:33,544 --> 00:34:34,544
I wish...

544
00:34:35,683 --> 00:34:37,113
I wish...

545
00:34:37,447 --> 00:34:39,034
I went to church more often.

546
00:34:39,201 --> 00:34:43,001
I could really use a favor from
the Man upstairs right about now.

547
00:34:49,352 --> 00:34:51,802
You're not gonna believe
what I found.

548
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:53,869
I'll see you Sunday morning.

549
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,270
You look beautiful.

550
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,130
Thank you.

551
00:35:10,626 --> 00:35:12,959
I am guessing this one's much nicer

552
00:35:13,126 --> 00:35:15,493
than your first wedding dress,
you know,

553
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,791
when you got married in Russia to...

554
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:19,810
Alexei Kosokov?

555
00:35:25,381 --> 00:35:29,376
Here in America we actually get divorced
before we get married again, otherwise

556
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:31,212
you spend your honeymoon in jail.

557
00:35:33,969 --> 00:35:35,498
Alexei told me

558
00:35:35,665 --> 00:35:38,315
If I marry him,
he will give me good life.

559
00:35:38,581 --> 00:35:39,781
But he didn't.

560
00:35:40,699 --> 00:35:41,999
He never worked.

561
00:35:42,472 --> 00:35:43,683
He treat me badly.

562
00:35:45,312 --> 00:35:48,912
Now he won't sign the divorce papers
unless I give him money.

563
00:35:53,822 --> 00:35:55,754
That explains Alexei.

564
00:35:58,656 --> 00:35:59,806
What about...

565
00:36:00,416 --> 00:36:01,866
the guy in Italy...

566
00:36:02,504 --> 00:36:05,538
who pressed charges after
you cleaned out his bank account?

567
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:10,320
That guy was a pig.

568
00:36:11,072 --> 00:36:13,222
Believe me, I earned every Penny.

569
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:18,164
We have a term in America for
women who get paid for sex,

570
00:36:18,331 --> 00:36:21,137
and it's not "Daughter-in-law."

571
00:36:23,695 --> 00:36:27,393
You know why it doesn't bother me
that you don't like me?

572
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,728
Can't wait.

573
00:36:29,938 --> 00:36:32,064
Because it really doesn't matter.

574
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:34,817
All that matters

575
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,280
is that one hour from now,

576
00:36:38,097 --> 00:36:40,615
I will have a ring on this finger,

577
00:36:41,273 --> 00:36:42,283
and I

578
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,675
will be the most
important person in his life.

579
00:36:46,922 --> 00:36:49,518
So give Preston your little file.

580
00:36:51,327 --> 00:36:53,177
I will explain it all away,

581
00:36:54,675 --> 00:36:56,725
And he will believe every word.

582
00:36:57,414 --> 00:36:58,674
He always does.

583
00:37:09,885 --> 00:37:11,235
Mom, do you mind?

584
00:37:14,762 --> 00:37:16,275
I need to talk to Irina.

585
00:37:49,248 --> 00:37:52,148
Your father told me
you called off the wedding.

586
00:37:53,703 --> 00:37:56,065
Obviously, I think
you are doing the right thing.

587
00:38:00,883 --> 00:38:02,568
I know you hate me right now,

588
00:38:02,735 --> 00:38:05,241
and I just want you to know
that I am okay with that.

589
00:38:15,908 --> 00:38:17,830
I love you so much.

590
00:38:17,997 --> 00:38:20,204
I would rather have you resent me

591
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:22,633
or even cut me off completely than

592
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,996
to allow you to make a mistake
that could ruin your life.

593
00:38:26,163 --> 00:38:27,263
So go ahead.

594
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:32,663
Hate me for as long as you want,

595
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:35,680
and when you are done,
I will be here waiting.

596
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,728
Try not to take too long,
'cause I miss you already.

597
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,602
Where you going?

598
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:08,967
Motel,

599
00:39:09,466 --> 00:39:11,933
Till I get flight
out of this horrible place.

600
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,895
What? The Scavos couldn't even
give you a lift? That's harsh.

601
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:20,383
I want nothing from the Scavos.
They're dead to me.

602
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,177
Lucky for you, I am not a Scavo.

603
00:39:37,304 --> 00:39:39,004
Sorry about the wedding.

604
00:39:40,007 --> 00:39:43,611
It's Preston's loss, man. I mean, he'll
never get someone as hot as you again.

605
00:39:43,778 --> 00:39:45,778
I don't want to talk about it.

606
00:39:46,042 --> 00:39:47,892
Sure. You know, I get that.

607
00:39:50,384 --> 00:39:52,994
You know, if you wanna save money,

608
00:39:53,161 --> 00:39:56,361
You could always skip the motel
and stay at my place.

609
00:39:58,198 --> 00:39:59,313
I don't think so.

610
00:39:59,721 --> 00:40:02,610
No, I promise, no funny business.

611
00:40:02,777 --> 00:40:03,777
I mean...

612
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,736
unless you want some.

613
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:13,023
I mean, think of it
as a transition relationship.

614
00:40:13,388 --> 00:40:15,121
It'll help you get over Preston.

615
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:18,069
I have no problem
letting you use me...

616
00:40:18,236 --> 00:40:19,386
Okay, enough.

617
00:40:19,574 --> 00:40:22,294
I'm a little out of your league,
don't you think?

618
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:26,215
I mean,
I didn't come to America to...

619
00:40:26,703 --> 00:40:29,593
end up with some
greasy-haired little boy.

620
00:40:44,061 --> 00:40:45,568
What are you doing?!

621
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:49,767
Eddie?

622
00:41:13,252 --> 00:41:16,348
<i>We all know that evil exists.</i>

623
00:41:17,657 --> 00:41:20,258
<i>The newspapers
are filled with stories</i>

624
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:23,378
<i>about young girls
who suddenly vanish.</i>

625
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:27,998
<i>But we don't pay attention</i>

626
00:41:28,165 --> 00:41:31,030
<i>because we're worried
about our marriages...</i>

627
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:37,982
<i>concerned about our friendships...</i>

628
00:41:43,295 --> 00:41:45,827
<i>anxious about our employees.</i>

629
00:41:49,933 --> 00:41:53,516
<i>Yes, we don't pay attention to evil</i>

630
00:41:53,683 --> 00:41:57,598
<i>because we think
it will never come to our house.</i>

631
00:41:58,586 --> 00:42:00,059
<i>But it does.</i>

632
00:42:01,025 --> 00:42:02,937
I'm here to pick up
Porter for school.

633
00:42:03,549 --> 00:42:04,786
And sometimes...

634
00:42:04,953 --> 00:42:06,703
- How you doin'?
- Good.
