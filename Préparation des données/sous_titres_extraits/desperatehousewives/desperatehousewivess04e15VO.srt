00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:04,720
<i>Gaby's new tenant...</i>

3
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:07,190
I understand you got a room to rent. We like you.

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:08,760
If you have first and last months' rent,

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:12,860
<i>We'd like you even more. ... came with a dangerous secret.</i>

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,030
<i>I'm your father. Wayne's return meant trouble for katherine.</i>

7
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:19,840
She doesn't know you, but i do.

8
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,910
Did you have anything to do with the fire at rick's restaurant?

9
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:25,350
<i>Lynette tried to warn tom about kayla...</i>

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,020
I think we have a seriously troubled young girl.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,320
<i>And in his time of weakness,</i>

12
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:36,400
<i>Orson chose the wrong shoulder to cry on.</i>

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,410
I don't... think...

14
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,590
You're right.

15
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:51,150
<i>The incident- As it would come to be known-</i>

16
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:54,480
<i>Happened late on a tuesday afternoon.</i>

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,180
<i>Witnesses included an old woman...</i>

18
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:02,630
<i>A blind man...</i>

19
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:06,400
<i>And a young boy.</i>

20
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,450
<i>The old woman,whose hearing was not what it used to be,</i>

21
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:13,630
<i>Saw bree hodge emerge from her house</i>

22
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,010
<i>In a way that told her</i>

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,050
<i>She was upset about something.</i>

24
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,120
<i>The blind man,whose hearing had become more acute,</i>

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,750
<i>Heard edie say... oh,hey,bree. What's up?</i>

26
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,130
<i>...in a way that suggested</i>

27
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,250
<i>Edie wasn't expecting any trouble.</i>

28
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,350
<i>The young boy, who was not yet 11,</i>

29
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,140
<i>Heard bree hodge say...</i>

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,780
I saw you kissing my husband.

31
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:40,090
<i>But he couldn't understand</i>

32
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,160
<i>Why someone would be angry about kisses,</i>

33
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:46,040
<i>Which he thought grown-Ups liked.</i>

34
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,040
<i>As the old woman pretended</i>

35
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,220
<i>To clip hedges she'd already clipped,</i>

36
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:54,340
<i>She saw the body language of her neighbors change.</i>

37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,190
<i>As the blind man listened in,</i>

38
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,850
<i>He heard bree say...</i>

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,220
What were you thinking,edie? We're supposed to be friends.

40
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,780
<i>We are friends. I am not interested in orson.</i>

41
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,370
<i>The young boy then heard edie add...</i>

42
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,110
So stop acting like such a bitch!

43
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:15,640
<i>...which included a word he was not allowed to use.</i>

44
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:21,000
<i>The old woman then saw bree hodge clench her fist.</i>

45
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,400
<i>A second later, the blind man heard a slap...</i>

46
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,790
<i>And the young boy saw edie grab her cheek.</i>

47
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,970
<i>As the two women parted company,</i>

48
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:34,140
<i>A thought occurred</i>

49
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:37,720
<i>To all those who had witnessed the incident...</i>

50
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,670
<i>That right there on peaceful wisteria lane,</i>

51
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,120
<i>The battle lines had been drawn,</i>

52
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,940
<i>And someone...</i>

53
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,950
<i>Was going to get hurt.</i>

Well,i'm gonna hug her. Oh! It's nice to meet you.

Oh,my goodness! Oh!

70
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,130
Oh,okay.

71
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:40,760
Oh,my son was right.

72
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,790
You are the prettiest thing!

73
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,830
Michael, i'm just taken with her.

74
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,720
Oh,well,good. Thank you. Come on,mama. Let's get you unpacked.

75
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:53,460
Oh,yes,let's do,'cause i brought you a present. Oh! Oh!

76
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,650
Let's go. Come on.

77
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,330
Wow!

78
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:05,160
It's all recipes.

79
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,460
Not just any recipes.

80
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,280
Some of these have been in my family

81
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:12,700
Since before the war of northern aggression.

82
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,210
You mean the civil war?

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,760
I mean what i mean.

84
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,950
Um,well...

85
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,780
I guess mike didn't tell you

86
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,590
That i'm,uh, really not a cook.

87
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,700
Oh,no,he told me.

88
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,080
That's why i gave you these recipes,

89
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,410
And i'm gon' teach you how to make 'em,too.

90
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,980
Isn't that nice,honey?

91
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,570
Oh, my meemaw always told me

92
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:40,550
That a lady should be a chef in the kitchen,

93
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,410
A maid in the living room and a whore in the bedroom.

94
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,920
And michael says you've only got one of those covered,

95
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,910
So i'm gon' help you with the other two.

96
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,490
Excuse me.

97
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,220
The one she won't be helping me with-

98
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:02,600
Please tell me it's "whore."

99
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,480
I call the computer. No way! I called it on the bus.

100
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,280
Whoa! Whoa,whoa,whoa! Guys, wait a minute. Wait a minute.

101
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,170
There's somebody i want you to meet.

102
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,600
This is dr. Dolan. Hey,guys. I'm joshua.

103
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,500
He's gonna hang out and watch us,

104
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:20,250
You know,be a family.

105
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:21,100
Why?

106
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:23,520
Because we've had a couple of...

107
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,840
Problems lately.

108
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,530
And my job is to find out what's causing those problems,

109
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,950
And then i can help you be a stronger family. Can we be a stronger family

110
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:34,530
While playing "age of empires iii"?

111
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,690
Yeah,sure. I wanna learn how to play that game.

112
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:39,460
Go get started. I'll join you in a minute.

113
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,120
So i like what you said

114
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,130
About making the family stronger,

115
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,390
But as i told you,kayla's the one you wanna focus on.

116
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,870
Well,i prefer to look at the big picture.

117
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,150
You see,if a family is dysfunctional,

118
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,740
It can lead to a child with problems.

119
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,970
<i>Yeah, or a child with problems</i>

120
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,940
Can lead to a dysfunctional family.

121
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,830
I mean,kayla's the one that got my kids to light a fire

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,070
And jump off the roof. Honey,it-It sounds like

123
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,490
Dr. Dolan has,um, kind of a plan here.

124
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:10,870
I understand. It just seems like...

125
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,990
At $140 an hour,we could skip straight to the part

126
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,900
Where you sit down with kayla

127
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:20,300
And tell her to stop being so evil.

128
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,220
Mommy?

129
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,750
Yeah? Um... i forgot to give you something.

130
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:26,720
Oh. It's a drawing i made for you in school.

131
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:30,470
Oh,well,thank you. It's beautiful. Thank you.

132
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:34,650
She never does this.

133
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,610
Mmm. Don't. We're waiting for ellie.

134
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,200
She's finishing up with a customer.

135
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,930
Well,maybe when she's done tattooing him,

136
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,870
She can put "stop hitting the blind guy" on my forehead.

137
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,560
You know,i've been hitting you a lot less lately,

138
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,550
And i don't feel

139
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,510
Like i'm getting enough credit for that.

140
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:55,370
<i>You're right. I'm a bad husband.</i>

141
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:56,960
No,seriously.

142
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,370
We're getting along better. Have you noticed that?

143
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,500
Yeah,i think it's because of ellie.

144
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,020
Me,too. It's impossible to argue with her in the house.

145
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,130
She makes us laugh.

146
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,850
She takes you off my hands every once in a while. Plus,she's always helping around the house.

147
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:12,040
I mean,yesterday, without even being asked,

148
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,130
She washed all the windows.

149
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,750
She's amazing. I don't know where she gets all her energy.

150
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,010
Okay,so we're square.

151
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,420
Dude,you gotta call me next week.

152
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,610
I got some great stuff coming in. All right.

153
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,020
Ellie,it's getting cold! I'll be right down!

154
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,610
So should i sneak out the back?

155
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,470
Oh,no. That's my landlady. She's cool.

156
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,070
She knows you're dealing?

157
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:36,570
<i>Well,she's not that cool.</i>

158
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,020
Oh,hey,guys!

159
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,840
You were up there a while. Can i see it?

160
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:49,120
Um,she- She means the tattoo.

161
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,200
I would love for you to see it...

162
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,640
But it's kind of down south.

163
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:00,300
Oh,on his... got it.

164
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,780
Does it hurt?

165
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,560
It's okay.

166
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:07,400
Ellie gave me something for the pain.

167
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:13,760
And fairview has a top-Rated school district,

168
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,320
Which,uh...

169
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:18,300
You'll appreciate in a couple of years.

170
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,370
Well,come on in. I'll show you the inside. You go ahead,honey.

171
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,730
I'll wait until mark wakes up from his nap. All right,we'll see you in a minute.

172
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:25,740
Okay. All right...

173
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,730
Hi! Oh,hi!

174
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,410
I'm bree hodge. Lauren baxter. Nice to meet you.

175
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:39,590
So are you thinking of moving onto the lane?

176
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:44,820
Yes. This house is exactly what we've been looking for.

177
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:47,600
Do you mind if i ask- Is it a safe neighborhood?

178
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:49,970
Oh,yes, the neighborhood's safe.

179
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:53,610
I wish i could say the same for your real estate agent.

180
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,090
Well,what do you mean?

181
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:01,310
What is this? You left it in the printer.

182
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,300
It's a house listing.

183
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:04,430
Yeah, for a house in baltimore.

184
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:08,790
Yeah,wait till you see it. It's got a pool and a garden. This is about dad,isn't it?

185
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:11,720
I'm doing this to protect us.

186
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,310
<i>We don't need to be protected. He's changed.</i>

187
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,590
It's all an act, sweetheart.

188
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,650
You don't see it now, but you will.

189
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,480
He's only back because he wants something.

190
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:27,280
I don't know what exactly. I just know we're not safe here.

191
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,690
Oh,sure. That's it. Dad has some evil plan.

192
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:33,080
It couldn't be that he wants to be in my life,

193
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,520
That he loves me. He isn't capable of love,dylan.

194
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,310
I found that out the hard way,

195
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,380
And we need to leave

196
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,800
Before you learn the same horrible lesson.

197
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,580
Move if you want.

198
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,430
I'm staying here with my father.

199
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,370
But what happened? Things were going fine.

200
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:04,760
I'm sorry. We need another realtor.

201
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,180
All right.

202
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,670
Biscuits are the foundation of any southern meal.

203
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,050
Like my meemaw used to say, "ain't nothin' you can make

204
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't taste better on a biscuit."

205
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,890
A fount of wisdom, your meemaw.

206
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,120
Uh-Huh.

207
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,490
Well...

208
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,540
I really appreciate this. Thanks,adele.

209
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,800
"Adele"? If you don't call me "mama," i'm gon' scream.

210
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,820
Don't do that... mama.

211
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,690
Now let's get started.

212
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:44,660
We're gonna need a flour sifter.

213
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,660
I don't have one.

214
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:49,040
Pastry cutter? Sorry.

215
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:52,590
Dough hooks? Don't even know what they are.

216
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,110
That's fine. We can improvise.

217
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:59,560
Why don't you start by measuring out our dry ingredients?

218
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:02,960
The flour and such?

219
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,110
Oh.

220
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,430
Michael is gonna be so happy.

221
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,730
After a long day of work,

222
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:13,350
He can come home to a nice, home-Cooked southern meal.

223
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,640
Although he also enjoys

224
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,510
Coming home to sesame chicken from red panda,

225
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,690
And they deliver.

226
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,790
You know,it's a shame that michael has to work so hard.

227
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,990
But i guess with all the money troubles

228
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,550
You two have been havin'... he told you that?

229
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,710
Well,we're getting past it.

230
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:36,210
Only because my son is working himself to the bone.

231
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:39,810
You know,it wouldn't hurt for you to get a job. I have a job.

232
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,240
Oh,you mean your little drawings?

233
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:46,080
Well,it's great for a woman to have a hobby.

234
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,720
Personally,i decoupage,

235
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,750
But i'm talking about something that pays.

236
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,210
Children's books pay.

237
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,370
Really? How much?

238
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,480
You know,i think,actually,

239
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,220
I might have those dough hooks somewhere.

240
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,500
Oh,dear. I've insulted you.

241
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:04,880
Now i'm just trying to be helpful.

242
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:07,530
No,no. It's fine,adele.

243
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,620
Mama.

244
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,170
So we were sort of surprised to get your call.

245
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,440
Don't you need to see kayla a few more times

246
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:22,200
Before you report back to us? Well,before continuing with her,

247
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:27,410
I thought it might be helpful to ask you a few questions. Oh,go ahead. Shoot.

248
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,040
Do you love kayla?

249
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:34,440
Lynette? Hmm?

250
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,760
I was talking to you.

251
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:39,550
Oh. Well... s-Sure.

252
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,020
I've been very good to her.

253
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,550
That wasn't his question.

254
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,390
Do you have a diploma on your wall,tom?

255
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,200
I don't think so. Zip it.

256
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,470
Again,um...

257
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:55,840
Do you love her?

258
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,300
Of course i do...

259
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,510
As much as i can,given the way she joined our family.

260
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:04,790
It's just-It's complicated.

261
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:08,020
I understand. The problem is,

262
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,560
Kayla has picked up on your ambivalence,

263
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,950
And she's become a very angry girl.

264
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,620
So what do we do?

265
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:19,870
Oh,god. Is this gonna be one of those therapy things

266
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,280
Where she hits me with a foam bat?

267
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,010
There's a bond that develops

268
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,230
Between an infant and her mother.

269
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:28,910
You and kayla never formed that bond,

270
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,690
So what we need to do is recreate it.

271
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,220
It's called attachment parenting,

272
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:37,600
And it starts with kayla being by your side

273
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,830
As often as possible.

274
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:43,650
That sounds like exactly what they need.

275
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,070
I mean,i don't have a diploma or anything,but...

276
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,730
I'd really like to give this a try.

277
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,000
Whatever keeps you and kayla close and interacting-

278
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,750
Go to the movies, go shopping,

279
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,470
Maybe take a little trip together,just the two of you.

280
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,810
Could we revisit the foam bat idea for just a second?

281
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:02,780
The plan sounds great,doc. Don't worry.

282
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,350
I will make sure that they are together constantly.

283
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,410
<i>As me if i love tom right now.</i>

284
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,900
Go ahead. I dare ya.

285
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,040
May i help you?

286
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:22,250
I haven't seen benjamin in a week.

287
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:26,040
I was thinking i'd take him for a few hours. It's not really a good time.

288
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,150
Well,bree,whenever i call, it's not a good time,

289
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:29,430
So if you don't mind,

290
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,910
I'd like to take my son to the carnival. Well,that sounds boring.

291
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,560
I know. Why don't you take him to edie's house,

292
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:39,930
And he can watch you give her a dental exam with your tongue?

293
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,250
Bree,you don't understand.

294
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:46,100
What you saw was bad judgment on edie's part

295
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,600
And good judgment on my part. I pushed her away.

296
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,110
Yes,eventually,with a big, dopey grin on your face.

297
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,650
Can we please put this behind us?

298
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,360
I would like to take benjamin. I don't think so. I'd hate for him to be around

299
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,730
When you had another attack of delayed morality,

300
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,540
Either with edie or behind the wheel of your car.

301
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,130
I am not having this argument.

302
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:08,610
He is my son,too.

303
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:11,510
Not exactly.

304
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,770
What? Don't even-

305
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:17,150
Strictly speaking, you're not even related to him.

306
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,700
I mean,it was fine for you to masquerade as his father

307
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,140
When we were together, but now that we're not-

308
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,300
This is wrong. I will hire a lawyer.

309
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:29,770
I've already hired one. You'll be hearing from him shortly.

310
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:34,560
Oh,and if you're in the mood for a carnival,

311
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:37,050
Why not call edie?

312
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,810
I hear you get three throws for a dollar with her,too.

313
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:45,610
Bye,gaby.

314
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,840
You guys going for another walk?

315
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,400
Yeah. We found this sweet hiking trail-

316
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,320
Goes right through the middle of the woods. Yeah,and unlike some people,

317
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,400
Ellie doesn't let the branches hit me in my face.

318
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,860
You're spoiling him.

319
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,180
What the hell?

320
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,280
Ellie,your door is locked!

321
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,220
Ellie!

322
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,600
Oh,shut up already.

323
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:54,810
Mom,guess what?

324
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,840
Dad's coming to my senior recital next week.

325
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,560
<i>I could swing by and pick you up,if you want.</i>

326
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:01,900
We could make it a real family outing.

327
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,370
Dylan,your father and i need to talk... in private.

328
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,320
I'm not done saying good-Bye.

329
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,870
Yes,you are. Please get rid of that gum.

330
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:15,540
I can hear you smacking all the way in the house.

331
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,160
Bye,sweetheart. Bye,dad.

332
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,270
Just so we're clear,

333
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,910
There will be no family outings.

334
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,860
Now,kathy, you shouldn't be rude

335
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,510
To a man who still has feelings for you.

336
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,670
Meaning what? You still love me?

337
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:40,480
I do. And i know i'm somewhat to blame

338
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,760
For what's happened between us.

339
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:44,020
That's why i've forgiven you for kidnapping our daughter.

340
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:48,820
<i>The least you can do is meet me halfway.</i>

341
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,700
Oh,wayne.

342
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:53,660
I don't deserve your forgiveness.

343
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,070
Maybe not,but i'm gonna give it to you anyway 'cause...

344
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:01,550
I still think we could be happy together.

345
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,020
<i>Could we?</i>

346
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,840
Given all the things i did

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,770
That you don't know about?

348
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:10,800
What's that?

349
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,570
I'm talking about all those men i was with

350
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,900
While we were married.

351
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:19,420
How can you forgive something like that?

352
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,300
That's a lie.

353
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,810
You wouldn't have dared.

354
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:26,340
Unhappy women do dangerous things.

355
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,370
I think the worst

356
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,410
Was when i tricked you

357
00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,720
Into thinking dylan was yours.

358
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:38,580
I wanted to tell you the truth, but i was scared...

359
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,010
For obvious reasons.

360
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:44,310
I don't believe you.

361
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:48,510
But i'm not worried anymore

362
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,790
Because you've changed.

363
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,550
So what are you waiting for, wayne?

364
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,960
Forgive me.

365
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,060
Hey there! Mrs. Mccluskey.

366
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:09,950
If she's not mine, then whose is she?

367
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:12,800
Does it matter?

368
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:18,870
Oh,i guess i won't be seeing you at the recital now.

369
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:22,380
Hmm. What a shame.

370
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,870
Are you sure it was cocaine?

371
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:43,880
Carlos,i was a fashion model in the '90s.

372
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,480
I know cocaine.

373
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,780
Damn it.

374
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,100
What are you doing? I'm calling the police.

375
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,310
Whoa,whoa,whoa,whoa!

376
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:57,080
Shouldn't we hear ellie's side of the story first? Here's ellie's side.

377
00:19:57,250 --> 00:19:59,800
"Selling drugs brings in more money than waiting tables."

378
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:02,920
There you go. Were you moved?

379
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:04,850
Okay,look, maybe i was wrong.

380
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,890
Maybe it was flour. Maybe she's a pastry chef.

381
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,720
Yeah! And she came up with that tattoo cover story

382
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,520
To hide her illicit baking.

383
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,090
All right,look, i know we have to do something,

384
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,410
But this woman's our friend.

385
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:21,010
Yes,and i'm a convicted felon still on probation.

386
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,060
Now if the police find out we're harboring a drug dealer,

387
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:28,000
They're gonna fry me. We have to turn her in.

388
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,500
Well,the priority for me

389
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,740
Is working out custody of benjamin.

390
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,960
To that end,i've written down

391
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,920
All the pertinent facts about the situation.

392
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,970
No,i don't want to do this over the phone.

393
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,660
Uh,listen. I'm gonna hop in the shower.

394
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:48,010
How about we meet in your office in about an hour? Great. Thanks.

395
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,270
Orson?

396
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,320
Orson?

397
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,430
The,uh,the door's open.

398
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,000
Edie? What are you doing here?

399
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,140
Get out here,you wuss.

400
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,280
That puritanical robot bitch of yours

401
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,190
Is sabotaging my business.

402
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:14,530
Okay,hang on a second. I'll be right out.

403
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:35,670
You know,uh,orson... forget it.

404
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,710
Just-Just take a nice,long shower.

405
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:40,970
Really? You sure?

406
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,960
Yeah. Uh, now that i think about it,

407
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:47,470
I can handle bree all by myself.

408
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,820
So that's when i saw all those bricks of cocaine under her bed.

409
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,650
I mean,i-I mean, i think it was cocaine,

410
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,020
And i think they're called bricks.

411
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,490
I'm just a simple housewife. I don't know what i'm saying.

412
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,660
Well,you've done the right thing,and it's thanks

413
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:11,550
To the cooperation of citizens like you-

414
00:22:11,710 --> 00:22:14,510
Yeah,yeah,yeah. When are you gonna get her out of our house?

415
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:18,560
Well,it's a little more complicated than that.

416
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:20,530
Meaning?

417
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,860
Bullock!

418
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,260
Oh,my god!

419
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,180
<i>What? What? I can't see anything.</i>

420
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,950
It's one of ellie's customers.

421
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,110
Actually, i'm detective bullock.

422
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,870
We've been tracking miss leonard for several months now.

423
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:40,000
Okay,so if you know what she's doing,

424
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:43,050
Then why don't you just bust her? She's small-Time.

425
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,220
We're trying to get to her supplier,

426
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:46,680
So we need her to keep dealing.

427
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:50,850
Wait. So you're just gonna leave a drug dealer in our house?

428
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,990
Yes. For now we just need you

429
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,740
To act normal,pretend like you don't know anything.

430
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:59,430
We'll move in when the case is made. Okay,look,

431
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:00,950
I'm all for doing my civic duty,

432
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:06,260
But this woman- She's... sort of a... friend.

433
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,700
And now you're asking us to trick her?

434
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:11,120
I'm not sure we're comfortable with this.

435
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:15,080
Mr. Solis, you're on probation,right?

436
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,810
<i>How'd you like not to be?</i>

437
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,950
<i>What on earth could you possibly want?</i>

438
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,730
Oh,i wanted to thank you.

439
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,190
After you scared off that couple

440
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,250
That were going to buy the young house,

441
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,280
I,uh,found another buyer,

442
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,120
And they're willing to go 10% over asking.

443
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,290
Well,good,when they drop by for their inspection,

444
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:46,310
I'll just have to have a nice little chat with them,too.

445
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:48,590
You wouldn't wanna do that to me.

446
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:52,110
And after all, we're family.

447
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,350
Family?

448
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,560
Well,yes, since my nephew austin

449
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,240
Is benjamin's biological father,

450
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:01,630
That makes me benjy's great-Aunt-

451
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,010
A term i don't exactly love,

452
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,680
But it's better than "grandma,"

453
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,700
<i>Which is what you are.</i>

454
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:10,290
How did you...

455
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,360
Cute story.

456
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:15,460
I- I went over to orson's to ask him to get you off my back,

457
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,660
And the poor sap-

458
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,940
He-He'd written the whole sordid tale down

459
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,460
And left it right there on the table.

460
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,770
Edie,if word got out,

461
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,980
My whole family would be... humiliated.

462
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,440
Oh,i don't want word to get out.

463
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:32,240
That would ruin everything, because right now i...

464
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,940
Well,i own you.

465
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,340
What does that mean?

466
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,300
Glad you asked.

467
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,530
From this moment on, i am your best friend.

468
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,670
You're gonna invite me to all of your fancy parties,

469
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,560
Set me up with all your single friends,

470
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,120
And,well,if i'm ever in the mood for muffins,

471
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,850
You're gonna bake 'em for me.

472
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,070
Edie... please.

473
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,930
And if you don't,

474
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,780
If for one second i don't feel the love,

475
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:02,350
I'm gonna bury you.

476
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,580
You understand?

477
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,400
Yeah.

478
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,190
Good.

479
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,340
Oh,by the way,um,i'm having an open house tomorrow.

480
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:16,010
A plate of banana nut muffins sure would set the mood.

481
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:18,670
Don't you think?

482
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,150
Oh! Oh!

483
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,110
Hey,honey, could you get that? Thank you.

484
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,110
Hey,bree,perfect timing.

485
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:37,650
<i>We were just getting ready to deal the cards. Bree,are you okay?</i>

486
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,730
There's something i've been... keeping from all of you,

487
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:47,490
And,um...

488
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:51,820
We need to talk.

489
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,850
Hey,wayne.

490
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,590
I finished that d.N.A. You wanted.

491
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,580
I'm probably gonna get in trouble

492
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,990
Because i put it in front of martin's triple homicide.

493
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,650
You bad girl.

494
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,500
Well,i owe you. I just needed to confirm

495
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,510
That the vic and my suspect are related. Oh,well,actually,they're not.

496
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,190
I ran the samples from the cheek swab

497
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,190
And the wad of gum you gave me,

498
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:17,600
And your suspect's not related to the victim at all.

499
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,830
Are you sure? Mm-Hmm. Oh, yeah,it's 100% exclusion.

500
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,440
Are you hungry? 'Cause i worked all through lunch,

501
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:29,610
And i thought that you and i could go get-

502
00:26:30,210 --> 00:26:31,920
Wayne?

503
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,980
Oh,my god.

504
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,020
And edie threatened to use that to...

505
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,280
Yes.

506
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,750
Okay,first of all, you're,like,

507
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:46,060
The greatest mom ever to wanna protect danielle like that.

508
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,870
Thank you.

509
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,560
I can't believe she was blackmailing you.

510
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,680
I can't believe she made a play for orson.

511
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,750
<i>I can. She went after carlos and mike and karl.</i>

512
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,880
The only person she hasn't gone after is tom.

513
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:00,510
<i>Yet.</i>

514
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:03,180
This woman is outta control.

515
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,620
What are you gonna do?

516
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,450
<i>No. What are we gonna do?</i>

517
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:40,410
Hey,guys,what's going on?

518
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,560
I told them everything, edie,

519
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,450
About orson,benjamin,

520
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,360
Everything. You did?

521
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,720
She did, so you can kiss

522
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:50,540
That little blackmail scheme good-Bye.

523
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,900
Well,i was only doing it because-

524
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:55,130
You were only doing it because you're the devil.

525
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:58,570
Okay,fine,chew me out and let's get on with it.

526
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,630
It's not like all the other times,edie.

527
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,310
We're done.

528
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,290
Done?

529
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,390
We're not inviting you to poker. We're not talking to you.

530
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,120
We're not even gonna wave when you jog by.

531
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,320
From now on,you are invisible. And we're gonna make sure every woman in a 5-Mile radius

532
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:15,020
Knows the kind of crap you pulled.

533
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,440
We tried to be your friends, but you don't even understand

534
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,930
What that word means, so now we're gonna be something

535
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,450
You do understand.

536
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:28,520
Guys,wait. Wait. I know i crossed a line this time,

537
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,970
And,well,i'm-I'm sorry.

538
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:32,270
Did you hear something?

539
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,250
Mnh-Mnh.

540
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,810
Neither did i.

541
00:28:42,870 --> 00:28:44,760
<i>Over here, honey,look at the camera.</i>

542
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,810
<i>Look at the camera. You ready to ride,dylan?</i>

543
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,390
<i>Now look,if you're scared, you don't have to. I want to.</i>

544
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,180
<i>No,you're a brave girl.</i>

545
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,630
<i>Hold up your arm for the camera,sweetheart.</i>

546
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:58,060
<i>How many stitches is that? 11.</i>

547
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,400
<i>And you didn't cry once, did you?</i>

548
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,790
<i>Can i ride now,please, daddy?</i>

549
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,680
<i>Of course,baby.</i>

550
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,680
<i>I love you,daddy.</i>

551
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,860
Dylan,it's me.

552
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:20,030
Uh,you need to come over here tomorrow.

553
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,860
Yeah,i know it's mother's day, but it's okay.

554
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,510
I got some things to tell you about your mother.

555
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,150
Ooh,i want this one.

556
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:37,900
Oh. Yow! It's a little pricey.

557
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:41,490
But i want it. You're the one who asked me to go shopping.

558
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,730
Well,i know,but we're supposed to be spending time together,

559
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:46,170
Not going into debt.

560
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,010
Oh.

561
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:51,980
How about this one?

562
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:54,990
What do you mean, "supposed to"?

563
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,490
I just...

564
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,540
It's good for us to hang out. I enjoy it.

565
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:01,540
Is this something that the doctor made you do?

566
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,460
No. All my idea.

567
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:07,760
I just wanted to treat you to a real fun day.

568
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,210
All right. You want me to have fun?

569
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:10,890
Mm-Hmm.

570
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,560
Buy me this.

571
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:18,390
Okay.

572
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,500
Good times.

573
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,730
I'd like an old-Fashioned, please.

574
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:28,390
What's the matter,michael? You tuckered out?

575
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,210
Oh,yeah,i just didn't get much sleep.

576
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,300
<i>Honestly,i wonder how you ever get any,</i>

577
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,410
Well,considering you got susan in the bed

578
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:36,960
Sawing wood all night.

579
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,380
I'm doing what now?

580
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,420
Snoring.

581
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,330
What'd you say it sounded like,michael?

582
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,070
A bunch of bulldogs in a bag?

583
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:50,290
But it is a sound that i've come to love.

584
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,210
You know what my meemaw did to grandpa boo?

585
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:56,020
She sewed a marble in the back of his pajama top,

586
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,130
Then if he rolled on his back to start snorin',

587
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:02,000
It'd wake him right up. But i guess you can't do that,

588
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,280
Seeing as how you sleep in the nude and all.

589
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,750
Well, that's gonna change real soon.

590
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,670
I'm gon' fix my face before i order. Excuse me.

591
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,880
Oh,this is nice.

592
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,190
Nice? She's driving me crazy.

593
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,680
You have got to stop complaining about me to her.

594
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,880
I don't... complain.

595
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:28,820
Well,you could see how i, as the nude,snoring whore,

596
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,380
Would think so.

597
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,120
Okay, now i might vent a little bit,

598
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,540
But she's just trying to help. Well, the next time she tries to help,

599
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,620
She's gonna get an old-Fashioned in her face,

600
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:41,910
So you better step up and start defending me. Okay,okay.

601
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:44,680
Well,lovely powder room.

602
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,840
It's amazing that such a busy restaurant

603
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:50,820
Can keep their bathroom cleaner than yours.

604
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,780
Now,mama,that's- That's not very nice.

605
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:56,880
Well,you're the one who told me

606
00:31:57,050 --> 00:32:00,180
You didn't marry her for her housekeepin'.

607
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,000
You just need someone to teach these things.

608
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,320
You know what?

609
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,110
Why don't i stay a few extra weeks,

610
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,760
And you and i can spruce the house up?

611
00:32:09,910 --> 00:32:11,910
And don't worry. I'll leave when the baby comes.

612
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,810
At my age,all that crying just cuts my nerves to shreds.

613
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:18,630
Now the first thing we're gonna do...

614
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,380
<i>Is wash your walls.</i>

615
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,760
Just 'cause we don't walk on 'em

616
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,710
Doesn't mean they don't get dirty.

617
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:30,030
Now how do you remember that?

618
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,550
...science project. Now when you used to read...

619
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,620
Oh,my god! My water broke. What?

620
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:47,920
My water just broke. I'm in labor.

621
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,160
We have to go. You're not due for a month.

622
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:54,240
I don't know what to tell you, mama. Look at me.

623
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,260
Aah! Come on. We have to get you to the hospital.

624
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,760
Well,yes,let's go.

625
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:02,230
No,no,no,you should take a cab home and start packing.

626
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:04,270
This one feels like a crier.

627
00:33:04,790 --> 00:33:05,600
Well, are you sure i should-

628
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,730
Aah! Aah! Come on.

629
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:12,140
Aah! Aah! Aah!

630
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,050
Ah. Ah.

631
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,330
You're doing great,honey. Just keep breathing.

632
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,990
How close are the contractions?

633
00:33:19,150 --> 00:33:22,690
A few weeks apart. Wanna go to the movies?

634
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,410
What?

635
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,530
I'm not in labor,okay?

636
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,390
But your water broke. I saw it.

637
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:28,380
That was club soda.

638
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:32,180
Amniotic fluid doesn't have ice cubes and a lemon wedge. What,you faked that?

639
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,700
I'm sorry. I panicked.

640
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:36,530
Your mother just invited herself to stay with us for three weeks,

641
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,200
And you said nothing. I had to come up with a plan.

642
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:41,150
Well,what happens if we go home with no baby?

643
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,490
I didn't say it was a good plan.

644
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,890
Do you see the effect she has on me?

645
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:47,340
I just thank god i wasn't drinking coffee.

646
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:53,270
I could've hurt myself. Okay, i get it. I'll talk to her.

647
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,040
Thank you.

648
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,140
Do you wanna go back in there right now and tell her?

649
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,460
No. No. The restaurant just comped our drinks.

650
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,780
We'll tell her at home.

651
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:09,500
Well,we've done enough damage for one day.

652
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,370
Let's go home.

653
00:34:10,530 --> 00:34:12,010
I want a corn dog first.

654
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:13,710
Oh,honey,we're about to have dinner.

655
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,580
But i'm hungry now. I want a corn dog.

656
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:19,390
All right. Thank you. If you're hungry,

657
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,200
I'll get you something healthy, and you can have it in the car.

658
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,060
Corn. Dog. Why can't i have one?

659
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,160
Well,at this point,

660
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,360
Because of the way you're acting.

661
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,660
Please don't do this, kayla.

662
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,710
We have been having such a nice time.

663
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:37,010
And we can keep having a nice time.

664
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,070
Just give me what i want,

665
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:41,970
Or you're not gonna like what happens.

666
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,910
Are you... threatening me?

667
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,260
I'm just saying,

668
00:34:46,410 --> 00:34:48,990
I got that idiot preston to jump off the roof.

669
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:53,080
Wonder what i could get penny to do.

670
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,310
I'm sorry.

671
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,720
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that,but that was...

672
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,470
That was horrible,what you said.

673
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,260
And-And...

674
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:09,180
You should never say that again.

675
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,740
Okay,so...

676
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,250
Come on. Let's go. Come on.

677
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,610
Oh,susan,you're up.

678
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,680
Michael told me about your false labor.

679
00:35:22,850 --> 00:35:25,990
That was unusual. Well,it happens.

680
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:28,450
I know,but usually your water doesn't break.

681
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,390
Oh,that. Um...

682
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:33,280
Turns out i spilled some club soda.

683
00:35:33,470 --> 00:35:35,860
Well,no surprise there.

684
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:40,060
Michael told me what a klutzy kathy you are.

685
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,210
I'm glad he finds that cute.

686
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,300
I myself don't have the patience.

687
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,700
Hey,mama.

688
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,350
Hello,michael.

689
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,130
Do you have a mother's day present for me?

690
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,210
He sure does, but i want mine first.

691
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,400
Mama,we need to talk.

692
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,360
About what? About the way you talk to people.

693
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,910
I mean,um,sometimes you can be a little too... honest.

694
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:19,630
Sorry. Go on.

695
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,600
It's just... you don't realize how things sound

696
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,700
When they're coming out of your mouth.

697
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:26,970
I know you mean well- Ohh!

698
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:31,170
I'm getting to it. No,no,no, i-I love where this is going.

699
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,440
It's just that,mama,sometimes when you're talking to susan-

700
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,220
Susan,you look a little pale. Are you okay?

701
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,890
Oh,she's fine. And i wish she'd cut it out.

702
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:42,030
No,i'm not trying to-Ow!

703
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,760
Susan?

704
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:46,460
Are-Are you going into labor? For real?

705
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,050
Maybe. Who cares? Let her have it.

706
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:50,200
Okay,okay.

707
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,260
Mama,you've gotta stop taking potshots at susan.

708
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,800
She's my wife, and i love her,

709
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,590
And i can't have you upsetting her.

710
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:00,630
Sweetheart,i-I am deeply sorry and mortified.

711
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,100
If-If i've caused you any distress,

712
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,390
I never meant to hurt your feelings.

713
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:08,260
Apology accepted. Let's go.

714
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,140
Oh. Whoo!

715
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:16,660
Happy mother's day!

716
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,820
Oh.

717
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,770
Oh,my gosh!

718
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:24,010
That is so sweet. Thank you so much.

719
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,420
We're gonna go get your present. Yeah.

720
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:28,220
Okay.

721
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,610
I hope you like turtles.

722
00:37:31,470 --> 00:37:33,200
So...

723
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:36,120
No kayla?

724
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,240
Well, she's still pretty upset.

725
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,490
Again, i know i crossed the line,

726
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:42,110
And i am so sorry.

727
00:37:42,270 --> 00:37:43,290
You know what? Let's not get into this.

728
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,270
I'm just gonna get angry all over again.

729
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:49,260
Tom,if you had been there and heard what she said...

730
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,670
It doesn't matter. You hit her.

731
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,000
Honey, she's just a little girl.

732
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:00,760
And now thanks to you, she's a frightened little girl.

733
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,460
Sorry to bother you, dr. Dolan,

734
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,820
But you said i could call anytime.

735
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,110
My mom...

736
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:11,020
She hit me.

737
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:13,820
No,it's not the first time.

738
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,960
I was afraid to tell you

739
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,610
'Cause i knew what she would do if she found out.

740
00:38:17,790 --> 00:38:19,230
Please help me.

741
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,050
I don't feel safe here.

742
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:25,960
I have to go. She's coming.

743
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:42,690
Uh,sorry about the mess. The maid took the week off.

744
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:45,950
You said you wanted to talk to me and...

745
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,250
Tell me things about mom?

746
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,500
You know what,kiddo? I-I had kind of a bad day yesterday.

747
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,210
I sat around here drinking, feeling sorry for myself.

748
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,060
And... and then i called you.

749
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,110
That's okay.

750
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,120
If you're feeling sad or whatever,

751
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,390
You should always call me.

752
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,860
<i>None of this is your fault. I hope you know that.</i>

753
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,650
None of what?

754
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,640
I tried so hard to let the past just be the past.

755
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,990
I didn't- I didn't wanna bring up

756
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,570
Who did what to who or why.

757
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,830
What did mom say to you?

758
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,790
And it turns out i've been kidding myself all this time.

759
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:22,510
This family that i've been fighting for-

760
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,680
It just- It doesn't even...

761
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,680
Exist.

762
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,270
We don't need her.

763
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,250
I'm fine with just you and me.

764
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,940
I'm happy now.

765
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:40,550
Ow! Dad,you're hurting me.

766
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,750
Dad,what's the matter?

767
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:50,270
You have to go.

768
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,660
What's wrong? Did i do something?

769
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,930
<i>Get outta here! Now!</i>

770
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,300
Ellie? Brunch is almost ready!

771
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,150
This is gonna be so hard.

772
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:18,800
You can't think of her as your friend.

773
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,930
Think of her as a drug dealer

774
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,890
Who could've gotten us into a lot of trouble. I'll try.

775
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,380
Oh! Shoot.

776
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,340
I wanted to surprise you. What's this?

777
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:35,020
Well,you know, it's mother's day,and...

778
00:40:35,770 --> 00:40:38,580
I have kind of a crappy relationship with my mom,

779
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,230
So...

780
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:42,370
This is my way of saying thanks for being nicer to me

781
00:40:42,530 --> 00:40:45,130
Than she ever was.

782
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,720
Oh.

783
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,890
Oh,honey!

784
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:55,490
I'm glad i didn't get you the chocolates.

785
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,480
No,travers,no,i decided spending mother's day with you

786
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,690
Is more important

787
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:07,130
Than spending time showing people stupid houses.

788
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,550
Oh,love you,too,sweetheart.

789
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:12,800
Actually,i think mommy's gonna be spending

790
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,260
A lot more time with you from now on.

791
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,150
But we'll talk about that when i get there,okay?

792
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:21,730
I love you,baby. I'll see you soon.

793
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:33,230
<i>It happens the second sunday of every may.</i>

794
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,030
<i>We celebrate the women</i>

795
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:37,830
<i>Who give us life...</i>

796
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,530
<i>And so much more.</i>

797
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:46,500
<i>The ones who protect us at all costs...</i>

798
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:54,090
<i>Who have the courage to fight those who would do us harm...</i>

799
00:41:56,070 --> 00:42:00,430
<i>Who put our happiness ahead of their own.</i>

800
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:03,590
<i>But mostly...</i>

801
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:06,490
<i>We celebrate a mother's love,</i>

802
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:10,840
<i>Which is constant,eternal...</i>

803
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,760
<i>And there from the very beginning.</i>

804
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,840
