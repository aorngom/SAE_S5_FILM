1
00:00:00,191 --> 00:00:02,296
<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,420 --> 00:00:04,210
I saw the man in your freezer.

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:07,066
<i>Mrs. Mccluskey and Parker
shared a secret...

4
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:09,007
You can never tell anyone.

5
00:00:09,157 --> 00:00:11,426
<i>But the secret was discovered.

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,392
You bet me in a game of poker?

7
00:00:13,542 --> 00:00:15,688
<i>Susan was forced to make a decision.

8
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:18,660
Get out. There will be no kissing,
and there will be no wedding.

9
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:21,537
Lynette ventured into
dangerous territory.

10
00:00:21,701 --> 00:00:22,920
You ever wear your hair down?

11
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:23,988
Sometimes.

12
00:00:24,084 --> 00:00:25,191
Looks really good.

13
00:00:25,423 --> 00:00:26,440
Thanks.

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,010
Are you embarrassed to be dating me?

15
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,125
If Gaby finds out,
she's gonna hit the ceiling.

16
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:32,831
<i>Edie came to
a disturbing realization.

17
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,887
Oh, my God.
You're still in love with her.

18
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,402
<i>And Gaby took a bold step.

19
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,737
<i>In a few months,
I will be Mrs. Victor Lang.

20
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,285
I don't know my own strength...

21
00:00:45,344 --> 00:00:49,858
<i>The night of her engagement party,
Gabrielle solis was injured.

22
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:54,832
<i>But she wasn't hurt by the chauffer who
almost slammed a door on her fingers...

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:58,476
<i>or the stranger who almost
stepped on her hand...

24
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:02,465
<i>or the waiter who almost
dropped a knife on her wrist.

25
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:08,878
<i>No, Gabrielle's injury came
about in a more unexpected fashion

26
00:01:09,849 --> 00:01:13,744
<i>and was caused by someone
Gabrielle thought was her friend.

27
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,116
Thank you.

28
00:01:16,323 --> 00:01:18,264
So have you told Bree
about your engagement?

29
00:01:18,872 --> 00:01:20,402
She's on the top of a Swiss Alp

30
00:01:20,553 --> 00:01:22,658
And still managed to send
a basket of muffins.

31
00:01:22,754 --> 00:01:23,765
You're kidding.

32
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:26,479
Damn things traveled 5,000 miles,
and they were still moist.

33
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,166
I don't know how she does it.

34
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:30,849
It's getting late.
Let's break out the champagne.

35
00:01:30,985 --> 00:01:33,760
Wait, you're not gonna embarrass me
with some sappy toast, are you?

36
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:36,300
I'm not, but Susan's written a poem.

37
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,400
A poem?

38
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:43,000
She's reworked the lyrics
to "wind beneath my wings. "

39
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,220
Testing.

40
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:47,010
One, two, three, testing.

41
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,615
What are you waiting for?
Get the champagne.

42
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,390
Thank you.

43
00:01:57,350 --> 00:01:58,580
Hi, Edie!

44
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,176
So I finally met Victor.

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,783
He is so charming.

46
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,053
Isn't he great?

47
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:05,739
I know it's been quick,
but he's just so amazing.

48
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:08,076
So you really love him?

49
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,248
He is the one?

50
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,314
He is, and I've never been happier.

51
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:19,010
I am so thrilled for you.

52
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,963
Edie, are you okay?

53
00:02:22,815 --> 00:02:24,715
Yes, I'm... I'm fine. I...

54
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,623
Oh, sweetie.

55
00:02:27,999 --> 00:02:29,808
Don't worry. You're gonna
find someone soon.

56
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,298
I just know it.

57
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,081
What?

58
00:02:34,805 --> 00:02:37,087
Well, actually,
I have found someone.

59
00:02:37,382 --> 00:02:40,416
And I am... crazy about him.

60
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,230
Well, who is it?

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,804
Oh, no. No, no.
Tonight is about you.

62
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,254
Oh, no, no, Edie. Come on.

63
00:02:48,405 --> 00:02:51,316
It would make me happy
to know who's making you happy.

64
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:54,280
Really?

65
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:57,525
I wanna know who's putting
that dopey grin on your face.

66
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,603
Well, actually, it's...

67
00:03:02,284 --> 00:03:03,340
Who?

68
00:03:04,797 --> 00:03:06,752
I've been seeing Carlos.

69
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,969
<i>and this is how Gabrielle solis
came to be injured

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,136
<i>the night of her engagement party.

71
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,955
<i>And though she seemed
to laugh it off,

72
00:03:22,556 --> 00:03:28,354
<i>Gabrielle had been cut much,
much deeper than anyone could see.

Desperate Housewives
Season 03 Episode 20

78
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:13,095
Greg is definitely off the wagon.

79
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:14,311
<i>Gossip....

80
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:18,251
<i>for most housewives, it's just
a harmless form of recreation,

81
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,449
<i>an exchange of semi-Interesting
tidbits concerning

82
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:24,360
<i>the semi-Interesting
lives of people they know.

83
00:04:24,626 --> 00:04:27,619
That mailman was in Sarah's
house over an hour.

84
00:04:27,896 --> 00:04:30,493
Packages weren't all he's delivering.

85
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,811
I could smell the
whiskey on Amy's breath.

86
00:04:33,029 --> 00:04:34,328
It wasn't even noon yet.

87
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,747
Joanne may say that she was off
on a religious retreat,

88
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,768
But since when does praying
make your boobs bigger?

89
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:45,641
<i>But the time comes in every neighborhood
when something very interesting happens,

90
00:04:45,865 --> 00:04:49,555
<i>and that's when gossip stops being
recreation and becomes...

91
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:50,818
<i>obsession.

92
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,501
<i>What kind of woman would keep
her husband's body in the freezer?

93
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:55,044
For ten years? It's crazy.

94
00:04:55,222 --> 00:04:56,424
Has anybody talked to her?

95
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,697
I've knocked twice.

96
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,768
She's not answering.

97
00:04:58,891 --> 00:05:00,748
I saw the curtain move.
I think I saw a hand.

98
00:05:00,845 --> 00:05:02,346
Great. Now we know she's watching us.

99
00:05:02,441 --> 00:05:03,668
Why should we be embarrassed?

100
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:06,065
We're not the ones who kept
a corpse-Icle in the basement.

101
00:05:06,093 --> 00:05:08,088
Oh, that's right.
She babysat your kids.

102
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:10,306
Oh, please, I don't want to think
of how many times

103
00:05:10,429 --> 00:05:12,329
She brought them ice cream
from that basement.

104
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,677
I mean, jeez, if you want to keep
your husband on ice,

105
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:16,795
At least have a dedicated freezer.

106
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:18,608
Do you think
she actually killed him?

107
00:05:19,443 --> 00:05:21,015
Why else would she have hid the body?

108
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,348
Well, so far, she's only been charged
with improper disposal of a corpse.

109
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,893
But once they defrost the body
and do an autopsy,

110
00:05:27,098 --> 00:05:29,503
I guarantee you they're gonna find
a belly ful of arsenic.

111
00:05:30,077 --> 00:05:31,280
What's arsenic?

112
00:05:32,815 --> 00:05:34,715
It's just... it's something
yucky, honey.

113
00:05:34,894 --> 00:05:37,100
Go on and play with your ball.
Go on.

114
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:42,122
We're trying so hard
to protect them from this.

115
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:44,678
There are just some things that
kids don't need to know about.

116
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,960
Hell, there's some things we
don't need to know about.

117
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:54,393
Would you guys excuse me?

118
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:00,870
Hi Gaby!

119
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,011
What's up?

120
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:08,810
I've been doing some thinking,
and you know how... how do I put this?

121
00:06:09,876 --> 00:06:12,800
You know how you feel like
sometimes people hate you?

122
00:06:13,449 --> 00:06:14,849
I don't feel like that.

123
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,860
We, you should, 'cause they do.

124
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,325
Since when?

125
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,720
Since you started doing things
to piss people off.

126
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,892
About what?

127
00:06:22,168 --> 00:06:26,686
I don't know. Off the top of my head...
dating your friends'exes.

128
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:32,295
So that big smile on your face
the other night was all an act.

129
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,729
You're not fine
with me seeing Carlos.

130
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,893
Edie, there are a thousand
single men in Fairview.

131
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:38,903
Why do you have
to date my ex-Husband?

132
00:06:39,012 --> 00:06:41,163
You're engaged to somebody else!
What do you care?

133
00:06:41,306 --> 00:06:42,520
It's awkward!

134
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:44,985
It's... it's like if I donated
a dress to charity,

135
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:47,285
And I went to a party,
and you showed up wearing it.

136
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:49,283
Again, if you gave it away
in the first place,

137
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,094
Then what the hell
are you bitching about?

138
00:06:51,185 --> 00:06:53,033
Look, Edie, just find your own men

139
00:06:53,214 --> 00:06:56,751
And stop snapping up
other people's castoffs!

140
00:06:57,771 --> 00:06:59,380
And what if I don't?

141
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:08,160
Then be prepared to suffer
the consequences.

142
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:09,890
Oh, please.

143
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,790
You are as tall as my legs.

144
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,230
What are you gonna do?

145
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,770
You're about to find out.

146
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,470
Who is it this time?

147
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:27,860
Um... it's Ian.

148
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:29,540
You gonna talk to him?

149
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,010
No.

150
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:33,290
Uh, he's got flowers.

151
00:07:33,439 --> 00:07:34,449
I don't care.

152
00:07:34,521 --> 00:07:36,240
Looks like it's two dozen roses.

153
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,730
Oh, good. I hope the thorns
rip him to shreds.

154
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:41,820
Okay, mom, I know what Mike
and Ian did was wrong, but...

155
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:43,990
they bet me in a game of poker.

156
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,050
They made decisions about my life
over a hand of 5-Card stud.

157
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:49,875
"Wrong" does not even begin to cover it.

158
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:53,488
Okay, but there are only
two guys in this world

159
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:56,302
Who know all of your flaws and have
still found a way to love you.

160
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,944
You're just gonna toss 'em both away?

161
00:07:58,607 --> 00:08:00,477
I don't need a man.
I don't even need sex.

162
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,850
I went without it the first 16 years...

163
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,640
22 years of my life,
and I can go a few more.

164
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:15,747
This should be interesting.

165
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:16,872
What?

166
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,100
Mike just walked up.

167
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:24,398
Give it up.

168
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,728
She didn't answer the first ten times.
She's not gonna answer it now.

169
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,380
Oh, this is getting sad.

170
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:38,530
Take it like a brit... stiff upper lip.

171
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,910
You know what? I've just about
bloody had it with you.

172
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,230
I preferred you when you were
comatose and pooping in a bag!

173
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,940
Well, lucky for you, I don't
have that bag right now.

174
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,619
All right, that does it.

175
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:54,088
Excuse me? Guys?

176
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:57,870
Hi, my mom would really like
for both of you to leave.

177
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:00,653
Don't soft-Pedal it.
Let 'em know I mean business.

178
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:04,353
'Cause if you... if you don't,
she'll be very, very disappointed.

179
00:09:04,532 --> 00:09:05,700
Rip 'em!

180
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:09,747
So just, um... go home and think
about what you've done.

181
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,410
If you want something bitchier,
do it yourself!

182
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,480
Here we are... ravioli stuffed with duck
confit in a porcini cream sauce.

183
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,850
What do you think?

184
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,500
I think it's a shame you didn't
make any for yourself.

185
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,540
Hi, honey.

186
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:44,050
Hey, I just wanted to say
I love you.

187
00:09:44,271 --> 00:09:45,598
Aren't you sweet?

188
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,328
What's that noise in the background?
Are the boys still up?

189
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,740
Yeah, they don't want to go to bed.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,331
Well, of course they don't.
They're kids. You're the dad.

191
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:55,477
Make 'em.

192
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:57,666
Well, I tried, honey, but
they wanna wait up for you.

193
00:09:57,732 --> 00:09:59,939
They... they miss their mom.

194
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,080
Ah, is this your way of guilting me
into coming back home?

195
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,700
Lynette, the... the restaurant
did close a half-Hour ago.

196
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:10,430
Preston, don't throw pudding!

197
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,460
Oh, Tom... I'm sorry.

198
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,620
I can't come home.

199
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:21,090
We're, um... doing inventory,
so... it could be a while.

200
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:23,100
Well, okay.

201
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,980
- Try to hurry?
- I will.

202
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,490
I love you. Bye.

203
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,320
Inventory?

204
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,850
I know. I'm a horrible person.

205
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:37,020
I just chose ravioli
over motherhood.

206
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,423
I should... I should go home.

207
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,351
Lynette, you got nothing
to feel guilty about.

208
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,170
You bust your ass in this restaurant
every day to keep it going,

209
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:47,830
And if anybody deserves a little
downtime, it's you.

210
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,930
Those are shameless
rationalizations.

211
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,539
Keep them coming.

212
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,310
Those, too.

213
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,743
There you are.

214
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,536
What are you doing outside?

215
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,140
Some big kids threw eggs at
Mrs. Mccluskey's house.

216
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,373
Oh, jeez.

217
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,080
They shouldn't have done that.

218
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,094
We should go talk to her.

219
00:11:24,468 --> 00:11:27,322
It's late. She probably doesn't
want us to bother her.

220
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,607
Come on, bud. Bedtime.

221
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:48,050
So here's what's gonna happen...
we're not talking to Edie anymore.

222
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,840
What do you mean, "we"?

223
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,585
I mean, "we" as in she betrayed me,
and you're my best friends,

224
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:55,060
So you're gonna support me because
that's what friends do.

225
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:58,980
And "support you" means...
acting like we're in junior high?

226
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,660
I can't believe you're not
furious at this.

227
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:05,870
Before she sank her fangs into Carlos,
she was dating your ex-Husband and Mike.

228
00:12:05,930 --> 00:12:08,000
Yes, and do you know
who I blame?

229
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,770
I blame Karl and Mike.

230
00:12:09,845 --> 00:12:12,150
Why isn't anybody mad at them?
I mean, let's face it.

231
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,200
The men... they get away with murder.

232
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:15,320
They're scum!

233
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,610
Okay.

234
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,501
Back to Edie... I'm not sure
I'm comfortable ganging up on her.

235
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:22,570
Really?

236
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:24,881
Because I wasn't very
comfortable taking your side

237
00:12:25,042 --> 00:12:28,479
When you were feuding with Patty Monroe
over the backyard fence line, but I did.

238
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:31,554
Gaby, that's not fair.
Nobody really liked patty to begin with.

239
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:34,960
Don't even get me started about
what I've done for you, okay?

240
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,010
I'm still boycotting
Madame Kim's day spa

241
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:38,718
Because of your botched bikini wax.

242
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,050
Oh, my God.
How do you botch a bikini wax?

243
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,839
She will show you later!

244
00:12:43,084 --> 00:12:47,546
The point is, good friends share
more than just gossip and brunch.

245
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,652
They share enemies, too.
So are you with me or not?

246
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,220
Of course we're with you.

247
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,380
We will give Edie the cold shoulder.

248
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,580
No, no! Not cold, frozen!

249
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:04,400
I want icicles hanging
from that bitch's ears!

250
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,200
Hello?

251
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,990
Hi.

252
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,170
Hey, do you still want me
to look at that book report?

253
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,630
Daddy helped me yesterday.

254
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,890
You weren't home.

255
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,640
Oh. Okay.

256
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,820
Daddy does everything lately.

257
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,470
How come you always
come home so late?

258
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,060
Well, I'm really busy
at the restaurant.

259
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,130
Believe me, I come home to daddy
just as soon as I can.

260
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,610
You're lying.

261
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,312
What?

262
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,320
You always laugh like that
when you're telling a lie.

263
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,400
Why would you say that?

264
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,039
Because... it's true.

265
00:13:53,826 --> 00:13:55,799
I stay late because there's
a lot of work to do,

266
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:57,805
And right now I'm the only
person who can do it,

267
00:13:57,815 --> 00:13:59,856
And now I have to go to
the grocery store because

268
00:14:00,037 --> 00:14:01,524
I am the only person who can do that,

269
00:14:01,645 --> 00:14:04,630
So why don't you go upstairs
and finish your homework?

270
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,930
But it is what you do.

271
00:14:32,281 --> 00:14:33,387
Excuse me!

272
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,552
Excuse me.
That's my space!

273
00:14:38,954 --> 00:14:41,780
Well, I'm parked in it,
so that kind of makes it my space.

274
00:14:43,423 --> 00:14:45,372
I waited for that spot while
the guy made

275
00:14:45,573 --> 00:14:48,262
3 phone calls and flossed his teeth.
You can't just steal it.

276
00:14:48,483 --> 00:14:50,551
It's a parking space!

277
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,805
Keep a lid
on your hormones, honey.

278
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:57,929
God! You did that on purpose!

279
00:14:58,130 --> 00:15:00,230
Yeah, and I'm about
to do this on purpose, too.

280
00:15:00,390 --> 00:15:01,730
Crazy bitch!

281
00:15:01,854 --> 00:15:03,362
What do you think you're doing?!

282
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,920
What are you doing?

283
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,830
I'm taking my damn space!

284
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,700
Get out of my car.

285
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,380
Say you're sorry.

286
00:15:11,471 --> 00:15:12,940
- Let me go!
- Say it!

287
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:14,362
Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

288
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:16,494
Say, "I'm a rude, arrogant bastard who"

289
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:18,665
"Needs to treat women with
courtesy and respect."

290
00:15:18,797 --> 00:15:21,652
I'm a rude, arrogant...
how does the rest of it go?

291
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,124
Freeze!

292
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:25,690
Was this man trying
to steal your car?

293
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:26,998
It's my car!

294
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:29,621
She... she tripped me and
grabbed my keys.

295
00:15:31,127 --> 00:15:32,473
Is this true, ma'am?

296
00:15:32,854 --> 00:15:35,105
Oh, all right, take his side!

297
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,710
Hey, who you spying on?

298
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,820
She hasn't returned my last
two phone calls.

299
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,190
I think something's up.

300
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:49,560
She's probably just busy.

301
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,390
Yeah, we'll see about that.

302
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,380
I am calling her right... now.

303
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:01,500
Oh, my God!

304
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:02,938
What?

305
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,160
She just screened me!

306
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,210
I have been screened!

307
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,960
Maybe she's in a hurry.

308
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,800
No, no, no. This has Gabrielle
Solis written all over it.

309
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,070
She is turning people against me.

310
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,600
And you're surprised?

311
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,630
I told you how she'd react
if she found out about us.

312
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,600
Well, if she wants to play these
school girl games, fine.

313
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,740
'Cause I invented 'em.

314
00:16:36,127 --> 00:16:37,130
Hi!

315
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,892
I just tried calling you.

316
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,702
Oh, really?
My ringer must've been off.

317
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:44,546
Oh, no prob.

318
00:16:44,706 --> 00:16:48,180
I wanted to invite you and the boys
to Travers' birthday party on saturday.

319
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:51,713
I'm having this reptile guy, and he's
got all these cool snakes and lizards.

320
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:53,439
The boys would love that,

321
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,690
But unfortunately, I gotta work.

322
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:59,497
Well, that's a shame, because
I was hoping you could cater.

323
00:17:01,132 --> 00:17:02,190
Cater?

324
00:17:02,643 --> 00:17:05,176
I'm gonna need pastas and salads
for the parents

325
00:17:05,297 --> 00:17:07,528
And at least 20 pizzas for the kids.

326
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:09,240
Wow, that many?

327
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,207
Yeah, and... well, you know kids.

328
00:17:11,288 --> 00:17:13,890
If one has a pizza party,
they're all gonna want a pizza party.

329
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,510
Hmm, could be good for business.

330
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:23,140
Well, yeah, I guess I could
work somethin' out.

331
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:25,380
Oh, I knew I could count on you!

332
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,220
Love you!

333
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,560
.... report.

334
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,710
I do not have "anger issues. "

335
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,670
I was just having a bad day.

336
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:43,100
You threatened to decapitate
a man over a parking space.

337
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:45,270
A very bad day.

338
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,570
Susan, when someone loses it

339
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,183
Like you did, there's usually a reason.

340
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,280
Are things going okayat work?

341
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,540
Work is great.

342
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:58,060
You could just sign that paper
and tell the judge I'm fine.

343
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,020
What about your family?

344
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,110
Family's terrific.

345
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:03,820
Seriously, you're just
wasting your time here.

346
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,000
How's your love life?

347
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,930
Cancel my lunch.

348
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,600
I'm gonna be here for a while.

349
00:18:25,786 --> 00:18:27,957
Will you stop ringing that damn...

350
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,027
I'm sorry, Parker.

351
00:18:30,057 --> 00:18:31,987
I thought you were
one of those little pissants

352
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:33,896
Who keep ringing the bell
and running away.

353
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:35,430
So what's on your mind?

354
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,760
I want you to come back
and babysit us.

355
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,960
The new sitter stinks.

356
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,480
Your folks hired a new sitter?

357
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,910
Yeah, and she thinks
carrot sticks are snacks.

358
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:51,910
Well, that's rough, but...
life's like that sometimes.

359
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,550
It doesn't have to be.

360
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:56,050
If you just told people
what happened with your husband,

361
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:58,390
Everything could go back
to the way it was.

362
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,320
Parker, you see those
women over there?

363
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,050
Nothing I could say would stop
those tongues from wagging.

364
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,600
I'm sorry, kid, but...
I just have to wait this one out.

365
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,280
Can you imagine?!

366
00:19:21,330 --> 00:19:26,180
I mean, finding out that two men
you trusted bet you in a poker game.

367
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,960
I mean, how demeaning is that?!

368
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,820
Well, it depends on how you look at it.

369
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:33,580
Men have been waging contests
over women for centuries.

370
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,640
I grant you, poker isn't as
romantic as, say, jousting,

371
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,470
But it shows how
they felt about you.

372
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:44,950
The real question is
how did you feel about them?

373
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:48,460
I told you... hurt and betrayed.

374
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:53,250
No, how did you feel about
them before this poker business?

375
00:19:53,850 --> 00:20:02,030
Well... I was engaged to Ian,
so... obviously I loved him.

376
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:05,940
And Mike? Were you
in love with him, too?

377
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,940
- How we doing on time?
- Susan.

378
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,010
Okay, fine, I loved him.

379
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,210
I still love him, and I love Ian.

380
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,400
So I am totally, hopelessly
in love with two men.

381
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,870
Now we're getting
somewhere. This is good.

382
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,700
No, this is horrible!

383
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:21,320
This wasn't supposed to happen!

384
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:25,080
I only let myself fall for Ian 'cause
I thought Mike was lost to me.

385
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,520
And then bang!
Suddenly he wants me back,

386
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:30,281
And now I have this choice
that I can't possibly make.

387
00:20:30,464 --> 00:20:33,781
- I agree. It's tough.
- It's devastating!

388
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,452
If I go with Mike,
Ian's heart will be broken,

389
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:41,527
And Ian does not deserve that.

390
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:45,870
But how can I reject Mike after
all he's been through?

391
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,480
So you're just gonna walk
away from both of them?

392
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,880
You have to make a choice, sweetie.

393
00:20:51,910 --> 00:20:55,870
You've got two great guys,
both of them crazy about you.

394
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:00,140
To let one go...
well, that's life. It happens.

395
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,559
To let them both go... that's just...

396
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,519
- stupid?
- Yes.

397
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:12,390
That would be the clinical term.

398
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:20,130
Sounds great. Thanks.

399
00:21:22,761 --> 00:21:28,110
Hey, how would you like to eat something
that's neither pasta nor pizza?

400
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,700
Such food exists?
Don't tease me.

401
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,870
No, my... my friend al,
he's opening a soul food place...

402
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:37,250
And sunday night, he wants to test
the menu with some of his chebuddies.

403
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,960
He said I could bring someone.

404
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,990
And... and... and you want
me to go with you?

405
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:44,043
It'll be after we close.

406
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,231
And don't tell me that
you hate southern food,

407
00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:49,824
'Cause then we can't be friends.

408
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:51,492
No, I love it.

409
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,771
It's... it's just that's
a little late for me, and...

410
00:21:55,135 --> 00:21:57,406
Okay. I just thought it'd be fun.

411
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,840
No, it would be, but sunday
nights are kind of crazy.

412
00:22:00,088 --> 00:22:02,902
I'm packing lunches
and checking homework...

413
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,529
Right, right. No worries. I get it.

414
00:22:06,266 --> 00:22:08,819
You're just, uh, first person
I thought of.

415
00:22:14,874 --> 00:22:17,085
You know, maybe I should go.

416
00:22:19,981 --> 00:22:22,996
It's part of the job to check out
the competition, right?

417
00:22:23,331 --> 00:22:26,708
Yeah, absolutely. It never hurts
to see what else is out there.

418
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:30,050
I agree.

419
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:50,335
Hey, guys, go check out the snakes.

420
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,051
I'll give you some pizza later, okay?

421
00:22:52,111 --> 00:22:54,118
- See you later.
- All right, I'll see you later.

422
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,291
Hey, you want some pizza?

423
00:22:55,595 --> 00:22:57,099
There you go.

424
00:22:59,113 --> 00:23:00,962
What are you doing here?

425
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,835
Edie asked me to cater. I know,

426
00:23:03,996 --> 00:23:07,112
I'm a total whore,
but please don't rat me out to Gaby.

427
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:08,960
Hi, Susan!

428
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,390
I have 30 copies of your book.
The kids can't wait for you to sign it.

429
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:15,760
Come on, let's go!
Come on, come on!

430
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,520
Looks like we're working
the same corner.

431
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,100
Yeah, only I didn't know Edie
was gonna have the party in a park.

432
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:27,360
- What if Gaby see us?
- Trust me, we can both relax.

433
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,310
I talked to her this morning,
and she's out with Victor all day.

434
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:33,810
Oh. Well, that's a relief.

435
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:59,210
Go ahead. I dare ya.

436
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:17,395
What's going on?

437
00:24:18,058 --> 00:24:19,465
"Witch"

438
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:21,556
- Hey, don't do that!
- Why not?

439
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,955
- Because she's not a witch.
- How do you know?

440
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:26,090
'Cause she isn't. Don't be a jerk.

441
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,345
What is she, your girlfriend?
Parker's in love!

442
00:24:28,545 --> 00:24:29,550
Shut up!

443
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,317
Hey, you boys! Knock it off!

444
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,874
Parker, I'm so sorry.

445
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,742
Are you all right?

446
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:43,383
You know, everything would be okay
if you'd tell people what you told me.

447
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,712
You can make 'em stop.

448
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,258
Hey, Lynette, it's Gaby.

449
00:24:55,339 --> 00:24:57,710
Victor got pulled into some
photo at the homeless shelter.

450
00:24:57,831 --> 00:25:00,605
So I'm free for lunch.
You wanna go with?

451
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:03,642
I tried Susan but she's not home,

452
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:09,066
Which is weird because her car's
in the drive way and... so is yours.

453
00:25:10,073 --> 00:25:11,500
Where is everybody?

454
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:31,389
Down! Down!

455
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:33,158
Lynette, what is wrong with you?!

456
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,496
- Gaby's coming.
- What?!

457
00:25:34,597 --> 00:25:36,205
I thought you said
she was with Victor.

458
00:25:36,245 --> 00:25:39,660
I was wrong. Come on.
Follow me. Follow me.

459
00:25:41,682 --> 00:25:42,869
Mommy, can I play?

460
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,270
No! Go ride the python!

461
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,810
Come on.

462
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,490
Rent A Reptile

463
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,240
Okay, okay, she's circling the park.

464
00:25:59,260 --> 00:26:02,370
Ugh. I wish she'd hurry.
I'm terrified of snakes.

465
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,770
Oh, yeah, I'm more
terrified of Gaby.

466
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,530
Okay, good, good.

467
00:26:06,711 --> 00:26:08,701
We're almost home free...

468
00:26:09,404 --> 00:26:10,430
What?

469
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,410
Don't turn around.

470
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,247
Hey, gab. Hi.

471
00:26:28,342 --> 00:26:30,714
- What are you two doing here?
- What are we doing here?

472
00:26:30,771 --> 00:26:35,790
Well, Edie hired me to cater,
so it's just business.

473
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,855
I don't know what her excuse is.

474
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,652
You are so dead.

475
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,077
I don't believe it. This is an
absolute betrayal of our friendship.

476
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,064
Gaby, she asked me to make 20 pizzas.

477
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,679
I couldn't turn it down.

478
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:50,191
This is so delicious.

479
00:26:51,114 --> 00:26:53,528
Is that what our friendship I
s worth to you... 20 pizzas?

480
00:26:53,648 --> 00:26:56,340
- We had a pact!
- Oh, come on, Gaby, be fair.

481
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,384
You put us in a really awkward position.

482
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,737
- Me?! You two owe me an apology.
- No, Gaby, be reasonable.

483
00:27:01,918 --> 00:27:04,734
I am leaving this party right now,
and if you two don't come with me,

484
00:27:04,895 --> 00:27:07,022
- Our friendship is over.
- Gaby! Oh, come on!

485
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,070
- What?!
- Oh! No, I mean it.

486
00:27:09,786 --> 00:27:11,233
Carlos, stop!

487
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,965
Put me down! What are you doing?!

488
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,086
Stop it! Carlos, put me down!

489
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,949
How dare you maul me like that!

490
00:27:20,085 --> 00:27:21,834
You were ruining
Travers' birthday party.

491
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,560
What the hell is wrong with you?!

492
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,003
I'm sorry.
Betrayal makes me a little cranky.

493
00:27:26,082 --> 00:27:28,090
Come on, Gaby, you can't tell
Susan and Lynette

494
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,714
Who they're allowed to be friends with.

495
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:31,867
- It's ridiculouS.
- I'll tell you what's ridiculous

496
00:27:31,947 --> 00:27:35,003
... you not having the guts
to tell me you were dating Edie.

497
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:36,570
Here it is.

498
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,640
Yeah. I had to find out from
her at my damn engagement party.

499
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:42,822
Well, I had to hear that you were
engaged to that Victor guy on the news.

500
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,609
I didn't plan it that way.

501
00:27:44,709 --> 00:27:46,176
It was spur of the moment.

502
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,408
Oh, so you just said,
hey, what the heck?

503
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,759
- You even in love with this guy?
- Yes, deeply.

504
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,310
Must be nice.

505
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:04,890
Well, aren't you in love with Edie?

506
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:08,440
We're having fun together,
but it'll never be serious.

507
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:16,210
So... if I'm just dating, and
you're in love and getting married...

508
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:20,390
remind me again why it is
that you get to be the angry one.

509
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,830
I'm sorry, Carlos.

510
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,869
You should be.

511
00:28:33,314 --> 00:28:34,902
<i>And for the first time,

512
00:28:35,063 --> 00:28:39,213
<i>Gabrielle was willing to let Carlos
be with someone else...

513
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:42,914
<i>Because she knew...

514
00:28:43,396 --> 00:28:46,140
<i>he still belonged to her.

515
00:28:48,431 --> 00:28:50,662
Feel free to take home
as much cake as you want.

516
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:51,908
I do not want to be tempted.

517
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:54,430
I might take a little for Tom and...

518
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,712
Hi, Mrs. Mccluskey.

519
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,269
Would you like some cake?

520
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,589
I didn't come for sweets.

521
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:08,103
I know you people have been
talking about me,

522
00:29:08,304 --> 00:29:10,796
And I guess the only way to shut you
up is to come clean.

523
00:29:11,078 --> 00:29:14,696
So... who would like to hear
the gruesome details?

524
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:22,042
- I would.
- Yeah. I... if you feel like it.

525
00:29:23,717 --> 00:29:26,310
First off... and I know this
will disappoint some of you...

526
00:29:26,631 --> 00:29:29,063
but I didn't kill Gilbert.

527
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:32,804
I came home from a weekend in
Laughlin and found him in

528
00:29:32,965 --> 00:29:35,217
Front of the tv... dead.

529
00:29:35,808 --> 00:29:38,180
He still had the remote in his hand.

530
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,526
Good lord.

531
00:29:40,358 --> 00:29:44,438
It was 2:00 A. M. , so I decided to wait
until morning to call the funeral home.

532
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:48,616
And I went to his desk to make
sure everything was in order.

533
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:52,805
I found his pension plan...
and guess what?

534
00:29:54,029 --> 00:29:57,566
In the event of his death,
I was not the beneficiary.

535
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,097
- Who was?
- His first wife.

536
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,206
They were married when he started
the job... for two years.

537
00:30:05,347 --> 00:30:10,478
We were together for 34 years, and
that idiot didn't change the paperwork.

538
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,850
I not only lost my Gilbert,
but I was about to lose everything.

539
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:18,457
So I, um...

540
00:30:21,043 --> 00:30:24,661
You put him in the freezer and
kept cashing the checks.

541
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:30,113
Well, what else was I gonna do?

542
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:36,740
Besides, after a while, it was
kind of nice having him around.

543
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,690
Anyway... that's the truth.

544
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,580
You ladies have my permission
to pass it along...

545
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:47,890
not that some of you ladies need it.

546
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:05,820
Probably weren't expecting
to see me, huh?

547
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,220
Well, after 20 unanswered
calls... no, not really.

548
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,640
About that, uh, obviously,
have been very confused.

549
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:19,200
I finally saw a therapist.

550
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:22,110
Actually, it was sort of a
court-Ordered thing. Anyway...

551
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:26,630
well, I need to talk to you.

552
00:31:30,580 --> 00:31:32,780
You sound... sure.

553
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,502
I am.

554
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,746
I'm gonna marry Ian.

555
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,580
Believe me, this wasn't easy,

556
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,827
Especially when you started
to remember how it was between us.

557
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,311
Maybe if the timing had been different.

558
00:31:56,612 --> 00:31:58,341
It wasn't.

559
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,180
I'm sorry, Mike.

560
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:11,310
Well, at least I have my memories.

561
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,550
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

562
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:32,010
Um, I told kim that we'd be out the rest
of the evening and she's gonna lock up.

563
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,850
- Great. I'll, uh, just get my jacket.
- Okay.

564
00:32:42,715 --> 00:32:44,540
Hey! You got a table for seven?

565
00:32:45,849 --> 00:32:48,160
What are you doing here?

566
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,112
Well, the kids wanted to surprise you,

567
00:32:50,233 --> 00:32:52,605
And it's been forever since
we've all had dinner together,

568
00:32:52,725 --> 00:32:55,057
So... what... well,
how did you t here?

569
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,475
I mean, you're not supposed to...
drive.

570
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:01,915
I took a cab, a double-Dose
of the painkillers, and voilà?

571
00:33:02,036 --> 00:33:03,906
- You surprised?
- Yeah, a little.

572
00:33:04,046 --> 00:33:05,393
We missed you.

573
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,958
Oh, I missed you, too.

574
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,692
Hey, why don't you guys go grab
that big table, and I will have

575
00:33:09,853 --> 00:33:12,003
Rick whip something up for us?

576
00:33:14,191 --> 00:33:15,480
Hi. You smell good.

577
00:33:16,143 --> 00:33:19,198
It must be the basil.
It has a kind of sweet smell.

578
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,582
Hey, Kayla, can you get a...
high chair for your sister, please?

579
00:33:23,387 --> 00:33:25,115
All right, who wants pizza?

580
00:33:25,354 --> 00:33:27,425
Hi. Uh, change of plans.

581
00:33:27,686 --> 00:33:29,294
Yeah.
Yeah, I see.

582
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:32,190
But... I'm sorry. You could still go.

583
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,025
Oh, no. I'll stay.
I'll cook for your family.

584
00:33:35,442 --> 00:33:37,070
Thanks. Thank you.

585
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:45,667
Thanks, sweetie.

586
00:33:45,788 --> 00:33:47,939
You are taking such good
care of me.

587
00:33:48,646 --> 00:33:49,832
When's Lynette getting home?

588
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,365
Oh, as soon as she closes up
the pizzeria.

589
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,108
Is that guy Rick helping her?

590
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:57,000
He better be, for as much
as we're paying him.

591
00:33:57,630 --> 00:33:59,439
I think Lynette likes him.

592
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,123
Sure. He's a nice guy, rd worker.

593
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,146
No, I mean, she likes him, likes him.

594
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,208
What makes you say that?

595
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,910
Just something I noticed.

596
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,240
Well, good night, daddy.

597
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:32,550
Mrs. Susan Hainsworth...
God, I love the sound of that.

598
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,512
Orid you want to keep your name?
Because I love the sound of that, too.

599
00:34:35,793 --> 00:34:38,024
As long as I get to call you my wife.

600
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,416
Deal.

601
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:44,001
You do realize we're gonna be bliss
fully happy, don't you?

602
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:48,009
I mean, it could actually get a bit
disgusting. People might throw fruit.

603
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,749
Oh, I'm gonna lock up down here.

604
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,810
Why don't you go upstairs
and warm up the bed?

605
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:00,876
You do realize we're gonna be
great together, don't you?

606
00:35:01,218 --> 00:35:02,304
I know.

607
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,066
<i>Hey, Susan. Um,
I don't mean to bug you.

608
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,995
<i>There's just so much
I didn't get to say.

609
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,478
<i>Um, I... God, I'm lousy at good-Byes.

610
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,338
<i>Anyway, you will always
be the best thing

611
00:35:27,478 --> 00:35:29,609
<i>that ever happened to me, and,

612
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,533
<i>well, I hope you find the
happiness you deserve.

613
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,651
<i>Bye. Oh, this is Mike.

614
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:45,405
<i>I don't mean to bug you.

615
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,316
<i>There's just so much
I didn't get to say.

616
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:52,012
<i>Um, I... God, I'm lousy at good-Byes.

617
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,868
<i>Anyway, you will always be the best hing

618
00:35:56,009 --> 00:35:57,999
<i>that ever happened to me, and,

619
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,735
<i>I hope you find the
happiness you deserve.

620
00:36:01,349 --> 00:36:03,930
<i>Bye. Oh, this is Mike.

621
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:11,393
Where are you going?

622
00:36:11,614 --> 00:36:13,784
Home... to England.

623
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,917
To England? What's wrong?

624
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,590
Well, it's just, um... I don't
think this is going to work.

625
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:23,602
What?

626
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,983
But just ten minutes ago,
we were making plans,

627
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,455
And you were saying how great
we were gonna be together.

628
00:36:29,641 --> 00:36:32,515
I, uh, saw you listening
to that message from Mike.

629
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,359
Well, Ian, I made my choice.

630
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,504
But not for the right reasons.

631
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,030
You're just trying to honor
a promise you made to me.

632
00:36:46,211 --> 00:36:47,718
That's not true.

633
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:52,412
I will get over him.

634
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:55,588
You've been trying to get over him
for as long as I've known you.

635
00:36:55,812 --> 00:36:58,043
Haven't had much luck, have you?

636
00:36:58,924 --> 00:37:00,854
Ian, I love you.

637
00:37:01,055 --> 00:37:02,723
I know you do.

638
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,950
But you love him a little
bit more, don't you?

639
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:20,599
I can't live a life where every
time I see you with a far away look,

640
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,875
I'll wonder if you're
thinking of him.

641
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,603
I'm so sorry.

642
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,059
You deserve to be happy.

643
00:37:34,632 --> 00:37:35,757
And so do I.

644
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,636
Good-Bye, Susan.

645
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,879
Hey, Mrs. Mccluskey.

646
00:37:58,994 --> 00:38:02,840
Well, it turns out our new babysitter
isn't working out too well.

647
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:05,533
Feel up to another tour of duty?

648
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:09,837
Are you sure you want the Wisteria
witch looking after your kids?

649
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,800
My kids know you're not a witch.

650
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,414
Too bad. I could use the leverage.

651
00:38:18,570 --> 00:38:22,170
We missed you. Same here.

652
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,330
I'm gonna need a raise, though.

653
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,670
I'm kind a strapped.

654
00:38:36,843 --> 00:38:38,894
I just talked to Mrs. Mccluskey, and

655
00:38:39,034 --> 00:38:41,346
She is gonna startlooking
after our kids again.

656
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,634
That's great!

657
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,272
'Cause actually,
I have been thinking, and...

658
00:38:46,563 --> 00:38:49,578
it is timethat I got back to work.

659
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,414
- What?
- Yep. I'm feeling good.

660
00:38:53,676 --> 00:38:55,505
I'm gettin' around better.

661
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,761
But... but the doctor said

662
00:38:57,982 --> 00:39:01,258
Your recovery would take months,
and it's only been six weeks.

663
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:04,342
Well, it's not like I'm gonna,
you know, dead-Lift a bag of ice,

664
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:06,986
But I can sprinkle cheese
on a pizza.

665
00:39:07,327 --> 00:39:11,568
Besides... I hate making you
run that place by yourself.

666
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,393
- I don't mind
- Really?

667
00:39:14,889 --> 00:39:16,919
Because before,
you said it was killing you.

668
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:20,151
Yeah, well, you know,
it is, but I just

669
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:22,262
Don't want you to come back
before you're ready.

670
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:24,204
You might reinjure yourself.

671
00:39:24,401 --> 00:39:25,908
I'll be careful.

672
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:29,026
The best part is we can finally
get Rick off the books.

673
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,482
Rick? Why would we wantto let him go?

674
00:39:32,773 --> 00:39:37,356
Well,I know he's been great, but,
his salary is cutting into our profits.

675
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:41,805
Actually, he is bringing in more than
enough business to cover his salary.

676
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,545
I mean, with all those new dishes

677
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:45,776
He's been cooking,
he's got a lot of fans out there.

678
00:39:45,997 --> 00:39:47,008
Does he really?

679
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:50,513
I think firing him
would be a huge mistake.

680
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:52,644
Well, it's just a thought.

681
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,299
Well, don't think so much.

682
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,948
Just rest and get better.

683
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,370
That's what you need to do.

684
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,563
You gonna be late tonight?

685
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:04,010
Probably. We got a big party
coming in at 10:00.

686
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,558
So... I'll just see youin the morning.

687
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,527
- I'll be here.
- Okay.

688
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:15,693
Hi, Ida. What's up?

689
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:18,672
That idiot postman
mixed up our mail again.

690
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:21,481
Oh, poor mr. Henley. He does seem
to be getting worse.

691
00:40:21,742 --> 00:40:22,968
Thanks for stopping by.

692
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,573
Hey, have you heard
about Mike?

693
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,409
No. Uh, what about him?

694
00:40:26,675 --> 00:40:27,801
He moved.

695
00:40:28,565 --> 00:40:30,354
Moved? What do you mean?

696
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:34,424
Mona Clarke was up at 2:00
in the morning with acid reflux,

697
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:38,111
And she saw him pack his car
and everything.

698
00:40:40,237 --> 00:40:41,480
Well, that doesn't make sense.

699
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,690
Mike wouldn't leave
without saying good-Bye.

700
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:45,060
Well, he did.

701
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:47,642
According to Carlos,
something bad happened,

702
00:40:47,843 --> 00:40:51,300
And Mike just wanted
to get the heck out of Dodge.

703
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,845
It's a pity. I always liked him.

704
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:10,830
<i>Gossip... it's just a harmless
form of recreation.

705
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:14,343
<i>It's careless talk that
deals in polite fiction...

706
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,876
I'd love to be assistant manager,
but apparently,

707
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:20,062
You have to flirt with Mrs. Scavo
to get that job.

708
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:25,607
<i>It's nasty speculation that's
based on not-so-polite fact...

709
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,677
He may be dating Edie, but everyone
can see he's still in love with Gaby.

710
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:39,922
<i>How do we protect ourselves from the
venomous sting of such idle gossip?

711
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,745
Aare you the lady whokept
her husband in her freezer?

712
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:45,676
<i>The best way is
to just tell the truth...

713
00:41:45,870 --> 00:41:48,473
Yep, that's me. Scary, aren't I?

714
00:41:50,214 --> 00:41:54,476
<i>And wait for people to start
talking about someone else.

715
00:41:55,742 --> 00:41:58,395
