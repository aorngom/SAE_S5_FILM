00:00:00,208 --> 00:00:02,002
<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:04,129
This thief was trying
to steal your truck!

3
00:00:04,379 --> 00:00:06,756
You're the guy who's four months
behind on his payments?

4
00:00:07,607 --> 00:00:11,475
<i>Mike reluctantly borrowed
money from Carlos.</i>

5
00:00:11,642 --> 00:00:13,263
Tell me how much you need.

6
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:15,765
<i>Andrew did his homework.</i>

7
00:00:16,015 --> 00:00:18,268
I made a few calls.
Turns out the golden child

8
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,917
never got his degree.

9
00:00:20,084 --> 00:00:23,064
I left school when the doctor
told me my mother was terminal.

10
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,899
I can save you a phone call
and bring in her death certificate.

11
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:27,110
That's okay.

12
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,015
The worst mistake I ever made
in my life was having you!

13
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:31,232
<i>A killer...</i>

14
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,283
<i>Got an invitation.</i>

15
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:36,077
We would like it if you
would move in with us.

16
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:38,246
<i>And Angie revealed her past.</i>

17
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,166
I got involved with a really
bad guy... Danny's father.

18
00:00:47,562 --> 00:00:48,933
<i>Many years ago,</i>

19
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,799
<i>a terrorist fell in
love with a woman.</i>

20
00:00:55,714 --> 00:00:58,198
<i>This woman believed in the terrorist</i>

21
00:00:58,365 --> 00:00:59,684
<i>and his cause...</i>

22
00:01:02,792 --> 00:01:06,069
<i>Until an undercover Agent showed up,</i>

23
00:01:06,236 --> 00:01:07,817
<i>determined to stop them.</i>

24
00:01:10,774 --> 00:01:12,836
<i>The terrorist wanted to attack</i>

25
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:15,492
<i>those he felt
were hurting the planet,</i>

26
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:20,547
<i>so he got the woman
to help him build a bomb.</i>

27
00:01:21,766 --> 00:01:23,869
<i>But something went wrong,</i>

28
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:26,090
<i>and someone was killed.</i>

29
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:30,879
<i>The terrorist didn't care.</i>

30
00:01:31,571 --> 00:01:33,833
<i>He said it was unavoidable.</i>

31
00:01:35,752 --> 00:01:38,557
<i>The woman wanted to turn herself in,</i>

32
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,422
<i>but she was pregnant.</i>

33
00:01:42,047 --> 00:01:45,484
<i>So the Agent convinced her
to run away with him,</i>

34
00:01:45,862 --> 00:01:48,650
<i>and he'd raise the child as his own.</i>

35
00:01:50,506 --> 00:01:53,238
<i>So they escaped from the terrorist,</i>

36
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,968
<i>hoping and praying</i>

37
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:58,817
<i>he would never find them.</i>

38
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:02,138
<i>Unfortunately...</i>

39
00:02:02,684 --> 00:02:03,684
<i>he did.</i>

40
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,627
If it isn't double
cappuccino, extra hot.

41
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,796
You know me so well.

42
00:02:10,744 --> 00:02:12,132
Just made chocolate scones.

43
00:02:12,796 --> 00:02:13,846
Interested?

44
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:15,934
What the hell...

45
00:02:16,364 --> 00:02:18,414
Might as well live dangerously.

46
00:02:19,432 --> 00:02:21,933
- So, how's the novel comin'?
- Almost done.

47
00:02:22,471 --> 00:02:23,971
Endings are a bitch.

48
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,970
I really need
to surprise my audience.

49
00:02:28,712 --> 00:02:30,411
I know you're my dad...

50
00:02:30,749 --> 00:02:33,061
but you still gotta close
the door when you come in.

51
00:02:33,594 --> 00:02:34,594
Sorry.

52
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:36,905
I was gonna ask you somethin'.

53
00:02:38,195 --> 00:02:40,243
You wanna join
your old man for a run tonight?

54
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,036
Dad, you don't run. You jog.

55
00:02:43,543 --> 00:02:44,622
And no.

56
00:02:44,872 --> 00:02:47,344
Come on. I'll be going by the park.
It'll be real pretty.

57
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:50,398
I'm working Eddie's shift tonight.
I'm gonna be here late.

58
00:02:52,688 --> 00:02:54,340
But I am proud of you.

59
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,559
Keep it up.

60
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,017
Thanks, coach.

61
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,591
See you at home.

62
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:09,355
That's your dad?

63
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:14,319
I should have introduced you.
You'd like him.

64
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,769
I bet I would.

65
00:03:16,723 --> 00:03:19,788
- So he's a runner?
- Every night, even when he's sick.

66
00:03:19,955 --> 00:03:21,405
You can't stop him.

67
00:03:23,157 --> 00:03:24,496
He's pretty inspiring.

68
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:26,883
Inspiring?

69
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:29,918
Don't guys your age
usually hate their dads?

70
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:31,669
We've had our issues.

71
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:35,109
But my dad's sacrificed
a lot for me.

72
00:03:37,373 --> 00:03:39,673
I figure this is how I pay him back.

73
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,030
You're right.

74
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,313
Payback's really important.

75
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:55,188
- All right, back in a bit.
- How long are you gonna be?

76
00:03:55,355 --> 00:03:57,455
Just long enough to get
a little sweaty.

77
00:03:57,622 --> 00:03:58,910
You be careful.

78
00:04:05,551 --> 00:04:08,225
<i>It took the terrorist 20 years</i>

79
00:04:08,392 --> 00:04:11,251
<i>to find the people
who had betrayed him.</i>

80
00:04:13,636 --> 00:04:14,686
What the...

81
00:04:24,309 --> 00:04:26,412

85
00:04:41,657 --> 00:04:45,577
<i>Our mothers tell us
to beware of mysterious men.</i>

86
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,914
<i>Don't talk to them in the park.</i>

87
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:53,366
<i>Don't take their candy.</i>

88
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,269
<i>Don't get into their cars.</i>

89
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,830
<i>And whatever you do...</i>

90
00:05:02,525 --> 00:05:04,673
<i>Don't let them into the house.</i>

91
00:05:08,285 --> 00:05:10,560
<i>But what do we do when mother</i>

92
00:05:11,253 --> 00:05:14,230
<i>has already invited them in?</i>

93
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:18,610
Eddie, what have you done?

94
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,629
I saw you were running low on supplies,
so I went to the store for you.

95
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:25,227
You didn't need to do that.

96
00:05:25,394 --> 00:05:28,953
You're cool enough to take me in.
I gotta earn my keep somehow.

97
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,003
I bought fresh vegetables.

98
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:33,374
Now you're just
trying to make me cry.

99
00:05:36,698 --> 00:05:38,440
Is that the laundry? I'll get that.

100
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,590
That's okay. It's Porter's turn.

101
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:42,611
I can't, mom. I'm late.

102
00:05:42,778 --> 00:05:45,303
You can spare five minutes
to put clothes in the dryer.

103
00:05:45,843 --> 00:05:48,431
I can't. Jeremy and Dave
are waiting to take me to the mall.

104
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:51,601
You are not leaving wet
clothes in that washer.

105
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:54,479
Mom, chill. It's water.

106
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,481
Don't talk to your mother like that.

107
00:05:59,322 --> 00:06:00,944
That's my ride. I gotta go.

108
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:03,115
After the laundry.

109
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:05,557
What a bitch.

110
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,495
- Tell her you're sorry.
- Get off me!

111
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,886
Apologize!

112
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:16,042
- He shouldn't talk to you like that!
- I'm sure he's very sorry.

113
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,092
Stop it! Stop! Let him up.

114
00:06:26,936 --> 00:06:28,972
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

115
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:31,424
Go join your friends.

116
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:33,391
Go on.

117
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:37,818
I'm sorry.

118
00:06:39,805 --> 00:06:42,255
I just can't watch
you be disrespected.

119
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:47,456
I'll take care of the laundry.

120
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:59,838
- Hey, Carlos. Here's the money...
- for the church raffle!

121
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:03,112
Thanks, Mike! Now sister Mary
can finally replace her wooden...

122
00:07:03,279 --> 00:07:04,385
Gaby's home.

123
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:07,245
Sorry. I just wanted to bring you
the first payment for the loan.

124
00:07:07,412 --> 00:07:09,854
- Thanks again. You really saved my ass.
- No problem.

125
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:13,185
Just so you know, I'm making a lot of
cutbacks so I can pay you back quicker,

126
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:15,935
no vacations, basic cable.
I even convinced MJ

127
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,182
that Mrs. McCluskey's house
is summer camp.

128
00:07:18,349 --> 00:07:20,944
Don't go crazy.
Just pay it back when you can.

129
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:24,195
- Let's make sure Gaby doesn't find out.
- So she can tell Susan?

130
00:07:24,362 --> 00:07:26,029
- No problem.
- I gotta get going.

131
00:07:27,261 --> 00:07:28,948
And give my best to sister Carrie.

132
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:30,366
Mary.

133
00:07:39,412 --> 00:07:40,567
I know, right?

134
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,629
It's the middle of the afternoon.
What are you doing?

135
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:45,965
Why don't you come
upstairs and find out?

136
00:07:50,036 --> 00:07:52,597
- No, thanks. I can't afford it.
- What?

137
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:54,752
Every time you
offer me afternoon sex,

138
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,186
it's because you want something,
and it is not afternoon sex.

139
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,566
All right, fine. Check this out.

140
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,445
Where were you even hiding this?

141
00:08:07,925 --> 00:08:09,934
That is a ski chalet in Aspen.

142
00:08:10,101 --> 00:08:11,657
It's for sale, and I want it.

143
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:15,661
- Sorry, hon, not gonna happen.
- That was just my opening offer.

144
00:08:16,432 --> 00:08:19,505
What if I see your afternoon sex
and raise you...

145
00:08:19,672 --> 00:08:20,893
honeymoon sex?

146
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,839
I can't. All of our cash
is tied up in a business deal.

147
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,725
- What kind of deal?
- You don't want me to bore you

148
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:32,595
- with the details.
- Half that money is mine. Bore me.

149
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:36,307
This conversation is over.
Now if you're interested

150
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,435
in going upstairs
and making love to your husband

151
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,895
simply because you...

152
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:49,654
Like it?
I've been practicing all day.

153
00:08:50,895 --> 00:08:53,574
Why is there a
big-ass piano in our house?

154
00:08:54,157 --> 00:08:56,673
Actually, big-ass
stopped making pianos.

155
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,792
This is a Yamaha.

156
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:01,951
So I'm...

157
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:03,709
curious...

158
00:09:04,931 --> 00:09:06,587
How much did this thing cost?

159
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:08,405
It was free.

160
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:13,177
You remember dear, sweet,
98-year-old aunt Regina?

161
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:15,388
The one you called
"the crypt keeper"?

162
00:09:16,209 --> 00:09:17,883
That was okay when she was alive.

163
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:21,310
Now she's a dead lady giving us
really cool stuff, so a little respect?

164
00:09:21,804 --> 00:09:23,804
Okay.
As long as it was free.

165
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,357
But as far as Gaby's concerned,

166
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,942
it cost 30 grand.

167
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,193
What? Why?

168
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,837
I love Gaby, but for years,

169
00:09:32,004 --> 00:09:34,490
she has been flaunting how much
they spend on her house

170
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,577
and her car and her jewelry.
And this

171
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,639
is my turn to flaunt,

172
00:09:39,806 --> 00:09:41,622
and I can't flaunt
with a free piano.

173
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:44,792
Don't stoop to her level.
You're better than that.

174
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,377
No, I'm really not.

175
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:50,086
I'm not kidding. You're not telling
Gaby we paid for this piano.

176
00:09:50,928 --> 00:09:53,796
Please. This is my chance.
My aunt had a stroke while driving!

177
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:56,387
When am I ever
gonna get that lucky again?

178
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:01,594
You're not gonna believe this.
They're out of cilantro.

179
00:10:01,761 --> 00:10:03,436
How can a market be out of cilantro?

180
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,778
I don't know, but I told that clerk
she should hang her head in shame.

181
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:08,399
As well you should.

182
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,325
- What else do we need?
- Let's head over to the kosher aisle.

183
00:10:11,492 --> 00:10:14,240
I need a few items
for the Schwartzman Bar Mitzvah.

184
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,702
We need baking soda. I'll get it.

185
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,824
- Please. Not now.
- What are you even doing here?

186
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:36,342
I lost my job.
I had to work someplace.

187
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,808
You already got the baking soda.

188
00:10:43,738 --> 00:10:46,521
I would lose my head
if it wasn't screwed on.

189
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:48,564
Who's that woman?

190
00:10:49,432 --> 00:10:51,150
Nobody. Someone I used to know.

191
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:54,098
Is everything all right?

192
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:57,910
I was telling her that
it doesn't make sense

193
00:10:58,077 --> 00:11:00,826
for a store this big to
run out of a major herb.

194
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:03,454
- We should check out Hudson's market.
- That's downtown.

195
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,054
We need cilantro, don't we?
Come on.

196
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,931
You brought me flowers.

197
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:25,344
I wanted to get you
a T-shirt that said, "I'm a moron

198
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:28,437
who wears dark clothes when I run
at night," but the gift shop was out.

199
00:11:31,874 --> 00:11:34,043
Who did this to you?
Did you see 'em?

200
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:38,447
What kind of person hits
you and then just drives away?

201
00:11:39,838 --> 00:11:42,451
Maybe the kind of person
who wanted to hit me.

202
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:46,622
Wait. You said you didn't see them.

203
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:49,893
I didn't, but, Ange,
I'm telling you, this guy...

204
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,442
he drives past me,

205
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:54,297
he turns around and
swerves right into me.

206
00:11:58,488 --> 00:12:01,143
- Where's Danny?
- He fell asleep in the waiting room.

207
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:03,472
We've been here all night.
You want me to get him?

208
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:05,913
I need you guys to go home,
grab the IDs,

209
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,394
some money, whatever
you can stuff in a couple of bags.

210
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,063
But you're not exactly
travel-ready, Nick.

211
00:12:14,412 --> 00:12:17,262
- Absolutely not.
- The place we talked about,

212
00:12:17,762 --> 00:12:20,823
near Carbondale.
Just for a few weeks.

213
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,633
Not without you.

214
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,622
I'll send Danny.
But you and me...

215
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:29,574
- this is as far as we run.
- What if it is Patrick?

216
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:31,083
What are we gonna do?

217
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,761
We've been asking that
question for 20 years.

218
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:40,963
I guess now we're gonna find out.

219
00:12:51,099 --> 00:12:52,855
Can I talk to you a minute?

220
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,483
Sure.

221
00:12:57,338 --> 00:12:59,070
It's about what
happened with Porter.

222
00:12:59,857 --> 00:13:02,457
- Are you mad? You're mad.
- No, I'm not.

223
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:05,229
You want me to leave.

224
00:13:05,894 --> 00:13:07,594
No, I just want to talk.

225
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:11,260
You looked like
you really wanted to hurt him,

226
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:13,501
and I kind of need to know
what that's about.

227
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:18,385
Your family doesn't seem
to care how much you help them.

228
00:13:19,546 --> 00:13:22,259
You're a great mom,
and they just push you around.

229
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:23,636
It made me angry.

230
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,250
Yes, I saw that.

231
00:13:27,099 --> 00:13:29,949
And sometimes my family
can be unappreciative.

232
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,566
But what happened today
can never happen again.

233
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:39,568
I know.

234
00:13:40,943 --> 00:13:43,447
Listen, I grew up
with an alcoholic mother.

235
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:49,880
I know what it like to be
angry all the time.

236
00:13:50,347 --> 00:13:53,779
But when I was your age,
I had to find a way...

237
00:13:57,449 --> 00:13:58,754
to control myself.

238
00:14:01,157 --> 00:14:02,550
How did you do that?

239
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:06,572
A lot of help.

240
00:14:06,739 --> 00:14:09,426
One thing... I had a great
counselor at school,

241
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:10,978
and she taught me

242
00:14:11,145 --> 00:14:13,655
that whenever I was
about to lose it,

243
00:14:14,335 --> 00:14:15,932
that I should do this...

244
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:18,899
One.

245
00:14:20,089 --> 00:14:21,110
Two.

246
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:22,862
Three.

247
00:14:23,698 --> 00:14:24,989
That really works?

248
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:27,158
It really does.

249
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:31,120
It gives you a chance

250
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:33,083
to step back,

251
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:35,736
feel like you're in control.

252
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,294
You should try it next time.
You'll see.

253
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:51,140
I'm really sorry about what I did.

254
00:14:52,241 --> 00:14:53,330
It's fine.

255
00:14:54,042 --> 00:14:55,811
Just don't ever do it again.

256
00:15:01,046 --> 00:15:02,996
But thank you for wanting to.

257
00:15:12,929 --> 00:15:15,164
Come on, Larry. You're my business
manager too.

258
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,459
I am not leaving this
office until you tell me

259
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:19,919
what Carlos is doing
with my ski house money.

260
00:15:20,469 --> 00:15:22,994
Gaby, you're putting me in
an uncomfortable position.

261
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:25,388
- You should talk to Carlos.
- I did!

262
00:15:25,842 --> 00:15:29,220
I offered myself in a very uncomfortable
position, and he still said no.

263
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:31,828
I'm sorry, but Carlos
swore me to secrecy.

264
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:33,495
Please respect that.

265
00:15:35,087 --> 00:15:36,787
You're right. I'm sorry.

266
00:15:37,107 --> 00:15:39,457
- No hard feelings.
- Of course not.

267
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:41,482
What are you doing?

268
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,532
I don't want to be a liar.

269
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:44,984
When I go home,

270
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,072
and I'm in tears and Carlos asks me
why, and I say you grabbed my ass,

271
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,824
I want to be telling the truth.

272
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:52,618
Well played.

273
00:15:54,428 --> 00:15:56,914
Carlos gave $50, 000
to one of your neighbors.

274
00:15:57,889 --> 00:15:59,333
What?! Who?!

275
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,545
A Mike Delfino. Apparently,
his business is in big trouble.

276
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:07,826
Mike's wife is one of my closest
friends, and she never said a word.

277
00:16:08,476 --> 00:16:11,637
- Poor thing.
- Please don't tell Carlos I told you.

278
00:16:12,254 --> 00:16:13,334
Of course.

279
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:15,768
I should get going.

280
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:18,686
- Do you have parking validation?
- Those are only for employees.

281
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,148
Okay, you could take mine.

282
00:16:25,714 --> 00:16:28,596
Hotel, food, incidentals...

283
00:16:29,263 --> 00:16:30,281
$300.

284
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,200
You can order pay per view.
I don't even care if you buy beer.

285
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,744
Just stay in your room
as much as you can.

286
00:16:35,994 --> 00:16:38,289
This is stupid. It's been 20 years.

287
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:42,167
Have you actually seen or heard
from this Patrick Logan guy?

288
00:16:42,616 --> 00:16:44,769
Do you know for a fact
that he's even still alive?

289
00:16:44,936 --> 00:16:48,066
- I'm not gonna debate this with you.
- If he started this group you were in,

290
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:51,812
then isn't he on the run, too? He's got
bigger problems than getting revenge.

291
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,230
Just humor me.

292
00:16:53,397 --> 00:16:55,667
Because if I'm wrong,
all I am is wrong.

293
00:16:55,834 --> 00:16:57,184
But if I'm not...

294
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,369
Please. Just humor me.

295
00:17:17,528 --> 00:17:19,228
I saw you the other day,

296
00:17:19,577 --> 00:17:21,327
talking to my friend Sam.

297
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,450
I'm Bree, by the way.

298
00:17:25,331 --> 00:17:26,781
I know who you are.

299
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:34,100
This is none of my business,
but I noticed that there was some

300
00:17:34,267 --> 00:17:35,967
tension between you two.

301
00:17:37,609 --> 00:17:39,059
You could say that.

302
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,367
Well, I hope everything is okay.

303
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:46,273
What is it you want?

304
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:52,816
I don't know. There was just
something so odd about that...

305
00:17:53,302 --> 00:17:54,302
encounter.

306
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:58,077
I don't understand why
he would talk to a friend like that.

307
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,672
Maybe that's because
I'm not his friend.

308
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,962
I'm his mother.

309
00:18:17,239 --> 00:18:19,939
My manager said I could
take a break early.

310
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,059
You've got five minutes.

311
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:26,730
Are you aware that Sam goes around
telling people that you're...

312
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,141
dead.

313
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:32,695
- Yes, I heard.
- Why would he do that?

314
00:18:36,099 --> 00:18:37,741
He's a complicated boy.

315
00:18:43,156 --> 00:18:45,456
Did Sam tell you who his father was?

316
00:18:46,837 --> 00:18:49,955
He told me about your
relationship with my... husband,

317
00:18:50,122 --> 00:18:52,372
if that's what you're referring to.

318
00:18:53,877 --> 00:18:56,977
Did he also mention
the letter that Rex sent to me?

319
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,520
What letter?

320
00:18:58,845 --> 00:19:00,845
It was after you were married.

321
00:19:01,116 --> 00:19:03,616
Rex had just started
his practice, and,

322
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,186
apparently,
the money was pouring in.

323
00:19:08,225 --> 00:19:09,225
Rex wrote

324
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:12,440
and told me
he could give Sam a better life.

325
00:19:14,428 --> 00:19:16,280
He then asked for full-time custody.

326
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:22,077
I'm guessing he never told you that.

327
00:19:23,425 --> 00:19:25,275
Must have slipped his mind.

328
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,084
I politely declined his offer.

329
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:32,629
And did Sam... know about this?

330
00:19:34,243 --> 00:19:37,443
Not until a few months ago,
when he found the letter.

331
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:41,897
And when he realized that he
could have lived all those years

332
00:19:42,064 --> 00:19:44,811
with his dad in a fancy house...

333
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:49,111
He... was beyond livid.

334
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:53,848
Even so, how could he go around
pretending that you're dead?

335
00:19:56,905 --> 00:19:58,105
Like I said...

336
00:19:59,422 --> 00:20:01,072
He's a complicated boy.

337
00:20:12,674 --> 00:20:16,612
I just got back from the supermarket
and realized I bought way too much.

338
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:19,960
I'm afraid some of it's gonna go bad,
so I thought, who could I give this to?

339
00:20:20,127 --> 00:20:21,887
And I randomly thought of you.

340
00:20:25,596 --> 00:20:29,019
You're afraid that canned peaches
and condensed milk are going to go bad?

341
00:20:30,118 --> 00:20:33,161
Well, it's just, my
cupboards are cluttered,

342
00:20:33,328 --> 00:20:35,651
and you'd be doing me a huge favor.

343
00:20:37,826 --> 00:20:38,826
Thanks.

344
00:20:41,027 --> 00:20:44,243
As long as you're here,
I want to show you something.

345
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,410
We just got it.

346
00:20:51,905 --> 00:20:54,002
MJ is gonna take lessons.

347
00:20:55,753 --> 00:20:58,504
You sure you don't want to
start him off with,

348
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:00,092
say, a used upright?

349
00:21:00,774 --> 00:21:01,774
No way.

350
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,742
Me wan-ny, me like-y, me get-ty.

351
00:21:07,510 --> 00:21:10,621
May I ask how much this cost-y?

352
00:21:11,737 --> 00:21:15,569
Well, Mike doesn't like
me throwing around numbers,

353
00:21:15,736 --> 00:21:18,825
but let's just say
your jaw would drop...

354
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:20,769
30,000 times.

355
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:23,907
- Wha...
- That's one.

356
00:21:25,474 --> 00:21:28,216
This is none of my business, but,

357
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:32,292
is this really the best time
to buy something this expensive?

358
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:35,502
I mean, didn't Mike just
have his truck repossessed?

359
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:39,019
Things finally turned around.

360
00:21:39,286 --> 00:21:40,966
He got a big cash infusion.

361
00:21:41,961 --> 00:21:42,968
You don't say.

362
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:47,697
Anyway, I know you
guys don't have a piano, so,

363
00:21:48,003 --> 00:21:50,058
if you ever want the girls
to take lessons...

364
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:53,854
Well, thank you. I gotta go.

365
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:55,554
Enjoy your peaches.

366
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,615
You owe me $50,000.

367
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,009
- What?
- For your information,

368
00:22:07,176 --> 00:22:10,078
Mike's "big cash infusion"
cost me my ski house.

369
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:12,039
What are you talking about?

370
00:22:12,553 --> 00:22:16,418
Don't play dumb. Carlos loaned Mike
the 50 grand, and you know it!

371
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:21,285
Why are you looking
like you don't know it?

372
00:22:22,143 --> 00:22:23,293
He told me...

373
00:22:23,638 --> 00:22:24,801
business picked up.

374
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:28,696
He lied, just like Carlos lied to me
about where our money went,

375
00:22:28,863 --> 00:22:30,974
which you went and spent on a piano.

376
00:22:32,043 --> 00:22:33,810
No, I didn't...

377
00:22:35,876 --> 00:22:37,126
I inherited it.

378
00:22:37,907 --> 00:22:39,483
I was trying to make you jealous.

379
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:45,197
Honey, given different circumstances,
that so would have worked.

380
00:22:47,923 --> 00:22:49,473
This is unbelievable.

381
00:22:50,643 --> 00:22:54,369
I have the money from the strip club
sitting in the bank,

382
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:57,292
and Mike would rather
borrow it from you guys?

383
00:23:00,301 --> 00:23:03,632
I'm about to screech at my husband.
You might want to stand back.

384
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:07,593
I have a better idea.

385
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,621
There you are.

386
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,985
- How was the flight?
- Horrible.

387
00:23:17,372 --> 00:23:21,360
It was delayed, there was turbulence,
they ran out of food,

388
00:23:21,703 --> 00:23:25,570
and I'm not seeing a plate
covered with tinfoil here.

389
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:29,266
There was one, but one of our
50 children must have inhaled it.

390
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:30,433
Damn it!

391
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,078
- Okay, calm down.
- Lynette, no. I'm hungry.

392
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,123
You know, when you were working,
I always had food waiting for you.

393
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,273
That's right. You were very
considerate in your eighth month.

394
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,655
I'm sorry. I keep forgetting,
you're the only person

395
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,169
- who's ever been pregnant before.
- Relax. Relax.

396
00:23:44,336 --> 00:23:45,981
We'll just order a pizza.

397
00:23:46,148 --> 00:23:48,844
And wait an hour?
Forget it. I'll fend for myself.

398
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,721
Six, seven,

399
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,554
eight, nine...

400
00:23:54,264 --> 00:23:55,877
It's okay. I'm fine.

401
00:23:56,044 --> 00:23:58,287
There's nothing in here.

402
00:23:58,454 --> 00:24:01,023
- You didn't go to the store today?
- 16... 17...

403
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,098
- You might wanna take it down a notch.
- I have been in three cities

404
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:07,487
in two days. You'd think you'd find
the time to go to the market.

405
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,449
- 21, 22...
- What the hell is he doing?

406
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,159
Eddie, it's okay.

407
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,912
- 23, 24, 25, 26, 27...
- Tell him to stick a sock in it.

408
00:24:16,162 --> 00:24:17,962
You need to kiss me. Here.

409
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:20,876
Okay, there. We're good.
We're good. He loves me.

410
00:24:22,318 --> 00:24:23,418
He loves me.

411
00:24:29,355 --> 00:24:31,155
We'll talk about it later.

412
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:37,893
So Eddie attacked our son?

413
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:40,187
Okay, I'd use "attack"
but with a small "a".

414
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:43,774
Okay, that's it. I want him out,
and that's with a big "O".

415
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,417
Look, Eddie is not some
exchange student from France.

416
00:24:47,584 --> 00:24:51,284
He comes from an abusive home.
We have to accept he has some...

417
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:52,741
baggage.

418
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:57,079
So I have to wonder if he's gonna punch
me any time I raise my voice to you?

419
00:24:58,253 --> 00:25:00,749
I am not sending him back
to live with that woman, Tom.

420
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,462
How about therapy? That might help.

421
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,464
Now we're gonna pay for his therapy?

422
00:25:07,922 --> 00:25:10,530
Okay, here's a thought.
How about we all stop yelling at me?

423
00:25:10,697 --> 00:25:12,594
What a concept...
Be nice to Lynette.

424
00:25:14,188 --> 00:25:16,556
Fine.
We'll try the therapy.

425
00:25:18,222 --> 00:25:21,345
All these weeks, Sam has been going on
about how his mother was dead,

426
00:25:21,512 --> 00:25:24,656
and the whole time, she has been
at Howe's market, in a smock,

427
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:26,023
stacking cans.

428
00:25:26,968 --> 00:25:30,070
I guess my instincts about Sam
were right, wouldn't you say?

429
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:32,197
What did I say about gloating?

430
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:36,785
Something. I wasn't listening.
I was thinking about how right I was.

431
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:42,124
- Okay, I'll stop. I know you're upset.
- You have no idea.

432
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,502
When Sam first showed up, I felt
like I got a little piece of Rex back.

433
00:25:46,256 --> 00:25:47,546
It was wonderful.

434
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:51,238
But this has forced me
to remember that

435
00:25:51,405 --> 00:25:52,843
Rex was a liar, too.

436
00:26:01,538 --> 00:26:03,788
Sorry. Am I interrupting something?

437
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:08,108
Orson, would you please excuse us?

438
00:26:08,583 --> 00:26:09,583
Of course.

439
00:26:14,555 --> 00:26:15,866
Everything all right?

440
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:17,367
Actually, Sam...

441
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,744
Wait, wait. Still here.

442
00:26:23,135 --> 00:26:25,250
I went back
to the supermarket today.

443
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,259
I take it you met my mother.

444
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,762
Why did you say she was dead?

445
00:26:38,124 --> 00:26:40,515
She is dead... to me.

446
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,185
So you admit that you lied?

447
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:48,231
Did she tell you
I found a letter my father wrote,

448
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,275
begging her
to let me come live with him?

449
00:26:50,726 --> 00:26:52,485
That's hardly an excuse.

450
00:26:52,994 --> 00:26:53,994
I was 4.

451
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:56,897
He said he could give me all
the advantages she couldn't,

452
00:26:57,064 --> 00:26:58,492
but she wouldn't let him.

453
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:01,140
She loved you. She
wanted you by her side...

454
00:27:01,307 --> 00:27:03,024
She should have wanted more for me!

455
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:06,429
Andrew got bicycles for Christmas
and TVs for his birthday.

456
00:27:06,596 --> 00:27:09,151
I had to sit in a trailer and
do my homework with mittens on

457
00:27:09,318 --> 00:27:11,787
because my mom couldn't
afford to pay the heating bill.

458
00:27:11,954 --> 00:27:15,217
If she had loved me, she would have let
me live the life that I was entitled to!

459
00:27:25,186 --> 00:27:26,186
I'm...

460
00:27:26,594 --> 00:27:27,644
going to...

461
00:27:28,908 --> 00:27:32,507
talk to the... Schwartzmans
about their Bar Mitzvah.

462
00:27:32,674 --> 00:27:35,987
If you want to go over the
menu later, let me know.

463
00:27:47,278 --> 00:27:50,259
- How'd it go?
- Kind of weird, but it was okay.

464
00:27:50,426 --> 00:27:52,463
I think you did very
good work today, Eddie.

465
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:55,878
Now the restroom is down the hall,
second door on the right.

466
00:27:56,045 --> 00:27:57,195
I'll be here.

467
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:01,964
So you said "good work".
Does that mean it went well?

468
00:28:02,131 --> 00:28:05,475
That means Eddie's got some issues,

469
00:28:06,058 --> 00:28:08,186
and it's going to take
time to work through them.

470
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:12,620
Okay... how much more
time at $130 an hour?

471
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:15,697
Well, it would go a lot faster
if we could get his mother in here,

472
00:28:15,864 --> 00:28:18,780
but he seems to think there's
no way she'd agree to that.

473
00:28:19,618 --> 00:28:23,326
Really? If you think it'll help,
I can get her in here.

474
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:25,310
That would be great.

475
00:28:26,369 --> 00:28:27,719
Okay, and then...

476
00:28:28,286 --> 00:28:30,542
and then
everything will be okay, right?

477
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,431
Let's just get the mother in here.

478
00:28:48,876 --> 00:28:49,876
Barbara?

479
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:52,101
It's Lynette Scavo.

480
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:02,496
Barbara,
we need to talk about Eddie.

481
00:29:15,157 --> 00:29:16,963
Are you looking
for Barbara Orlofsky?

482
00:29:17,575 --> 00:29:21,250
- Yeah. Do you know where she is?
- No. Nobody's seen her for days,

483
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:23,867
and her car's still there.
It's weird.

484
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:39,444
There's this crazy rumor going around
that you've got something for me.

485
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:42,530
Just an apology.

486
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:46,459
Well, as long as it comes
with one of your muffins,

487
00:29:46,626 --> 00:29:48,036
I may just accept it.

488
00:29:54,134 --> 00:29:55,727
Orson told me about Sam.

489
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,880
You were right from the start.
I never should have trusted him.

490
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:03,737
I don't even need the muffin now.

491
00:30:05,098 --> 00:30:07,889
Now that that's settled,
what are we gonna do about Sam?

492
00:30:08,468 --> 00:30:10,459
That's easy. We get rid of him.

493
00:30:10,626 --> 00:30:12,644
I don't think
it's gonna be that simple.

494
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:14,240
Why not?

495
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:19,683
I saw a side to him last night
that I've never seen before, and,

496
00:30:20,502 --> 00:30:22,252
to be perfectly honest...

497
00:30:23,981 --> 00:30:25,381
I'm afraid of him.

498
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,080
Hi, Susan! Thanks for
having us over for dinner.

499
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,582
Well, actually,
dinner was just an excuse.

500
00:30:34,832 --> 00:30:36,414
I wanted to show you something.

501
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,157
You bought a piano?

502
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:43,202
And I wanted you
to be the first to see it.

503
00:30:44,211 --> 00:30:46,386
That looks... pricey.

504
00:30:46,850 --> 00:30:48,138
$30,000,

505
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,933
plus delivery and tax
and a biannual tuning fee.

506
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,053
But Mike's on his way down.
Do me a favor.

507
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,123
Don't let on
you know how much it cost.

508
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,511
- Why not?
- He thinks it's ostentatious,

509
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:03,174
and he's a little embarrassed.
In fact, he keeps telling everyone

510
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:05,738
that I inherited it from my aunt,
so just go with it.

511
00:31:05,988 --> 00:31:07,449
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

512
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,784
That's okay, honey.
I'm gonna check on dinner.

513
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,463
We're gonna check on dinner.

514
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,971
Dude, we need to talk.

515
00:31:15,302 --> 00:31:16,332
A piano?

516
00:31:17,132 --> 00:31:20,587
Don't worry about it, we didn't buy it.
Susan inherited it from her dead aunt.

517
00:31:23,812 --> 00:31:25,049
Without even blinking.

518
00:31:26,307 --> 00:31:28,562
Would anyone mind
helping me set the table?

519
00:31:28,729 --> 00:31:30,221
- Carlos will do it.
- Great.

520
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,987
And, Mike, maybe you and Gaby
can get the wine.

521
00:31:35,709 --> 00:31:39,314
So you and Carlos have any big plans
for the summer? You taking any trips?

522
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:48,922
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

523
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:52,335
Look, if you need to talk...

524
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:54,412
Susan's in the other room.

525
00:31:55,796 --> 00:31:57,540
I think Carlos is having an affair.

526
00:31:58,221 --> 00:32:00,210
What? Why would you think that?

527
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,653
Because he's been acting
really secretive lately.

528
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,792
And I went to talk to
our business manager,

529
00:32:04,959 --> 00:32:07,383
and I discovered $50, 000
was missing from our account.

530
00:32:08,318 --> 00:32:10,803
Well, I'm sure
there's a good explanation.

531
00:32:11,586 --> 00:32:12,685
Yeah, there is.

532
00:32:12,852 --> 00:32:15,809
It's called fancy dresses and
hotel rooms for some bimbo.

533
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,561
No, no, no. I am sure
that you've got that all wrong.

534
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:21,981
Wait a minute.
Are you covering for him?

535
00:32:23,786 --> 00:32:26,418
Because I stole his cell phone
to see who he was talking to,

536
00:32:26,585 --> 00:32:28,743
and he called your house,
like, a hundred times.

537
00:32:29,193 --> 00:32:31,347
- He hasn't been talking to me.
- Really?

538
00:32:31,514 --> 00:32:33,474
Well, the next time
he's not talking to you,

539
00:32:33,641 --> 00:32:36,079
you might want to give him
the name of your divorce lawyer.

540
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:42,794
I'm so glad you guys were free tonight.
We've been wanting to do this for...

541
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,923
- What's wrong?
- My earring. It's missing. Damn it!

542
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,343
- I just got them today.
- I'm sure it's somewhere.

543
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:51,769
Here it is.

544
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:55,974
That would have been
3 grand out the window.

545
00:32:56,883 --> 00:32:59,519
- You bought $3,000 earrings?
- Of course not.

546
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:01,686
Mike did.

547
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:05,483
He's so generous,
especially now that we're loaded again.

548
00:33:08,077 --> 00:33:10,777
You know, Carlos,
I never noticed before...

549
00:33:11,174 --> 00:33:13,533
you have a really veiny forehead.

550
00:33:18,561 --> 00:33:20,873
- Buddy, we got a bit of a problem.
- No kidding.

551
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:23,251
Wait, you know?
Did Gaby say something?

552
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:25,044
No. I heard it all from Susan.

553
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,548
Well, it's not surprising, the way those
two talk, but luckily, it's not true.

554
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,509
Come on, Mike. Let's stop the lies.
It is true, we both know it.

555
00:33:32,595 --> 00:33:34,445
- It is?
- Don't act surprised.

556
00:33:34,612 --> 00:33:37,678
God, this whole thing was a mistake.
I never should've written that check.

557
00:33:37,845 --> 00:33:39,950
You paid for it?
Oh, man.

558
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:42,604
Dinner is ready.

559
00:33:44,313 --> 00:33:46,763
- Everything smells so good.
- Thanks.

560
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:50,266
You want some meatballs, Carlos?

561
00:33:50,433 --> 00:33:52,947
I've got two nice,
big ones for you right here.

562
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:55,199
Nope. I'm fine.

563
00:33:56,955 --> 00:33:58,005
I saw that.

564
00:33:58,879 --> 00:33:59,879
Saw what?

565
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:01,998
You leering at Susan's breasts.

566
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,716
I was looking at the pasta.
Susan's breasts

567
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:08,880
- just happened to be hovering nearby.
- Gaby, leave Carlos alone.

568
00:34:10,565 --> 00:34:11,883
Oh, my God. It's you.

569
00:34:13,483 --> 00:34:14,973
- Excuse me?
- You're the one

570
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,929
- Carlos is having an affair with.
- What?

571
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,232
What?

572
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,146
Makes perfect sense. That's why
there were all those phone calls

573
00:34:21,313 --> 00:34:24,062
- to this house from his cell phone.
- You looked at my cell phone?

574
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:26,397
Yes, and thank God I did.
Whore!

575
00:34:27,246 --> 00:34:30,652
Shamelessly shoving your meatballs
in my husband's face.

576
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,780
There was no shoving.
Sometimes they spontaneously heave.

577
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:37,381
Have you lost your mind?
I am not having an affair with Susan.

578
00:34:37,548 --> 00:34:39,224
Mike, you believe me, right?

579
00:34:39,391 --> 00:34:41,134
Yeah... I guess.

580
00:34:41,459 --> 00:34:44,662
It's just... why are you
calling over here all the time?

581
00:34:44,829 --> 00:34:47,212
I'm not! I always call your cell!

582
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,150
Susan, say something.

583
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:53,883
Forget it, Carlos.
We might as well confess.

584
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,969
Confess what?!

585
00:34:58,304 --> 00:35:00,690
You wouldn't take my money
when you were in trouble, and,

586
00:35:00,857 --> 00:35:03,586
well, I've always known
that Carlos had a thing for me, so,

587
00:35:03,753 --> 00:35:06,980
I told him that I would sleep with him
if he would loan you money.

588
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,437
You son of a bitch!

589
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:15,325
I didn't touch her. All I did was help
a friend who screwed me over buying

590
00:35:15,492 --> 00:35:17,281
diamond earrings and grand pianos.

591
00:35:17,531 --> 00:35:19,741
I told you, the piano was a gift
from Susan's aunt!

592
00:35:19,908 --> 00:35:21,808
You bought diamond earrings?

593
00:35:22,684 --> 00:35:25,498
With the $50, 000
that you borrowed from Carlos.

594
00:35:26,513 --> 00:35:27,542
You know?

595
00:35:29,688 --> 00:35:31,301
So you two were just...

596
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,464
Screwing with you, yes.

597
00:35:35,674 --> 00:35:39,149
So tell me, Mike,
do you feel betrayed, humiliated?

598
00:35:40,343 --> 00:35:42,140
Good. Because I only did this

599
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:44,665
to show you what it feels like
when the person that

600
00:35:44,832 --> 00:35:47,632
is supposed to love you the most
lies to you.

601
00:35:51,345 --> 00:35:53,895
I just did it
cause I want a ski chalet.

602
00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:00,727
I just keep trying
to think what I can say

603
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:02,535
so you'll know how sorry I am.

604
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:06,748
Well, I do know,

605
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,585
and I'm not looking
for another apology.

606
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:15,767
What I am looking for is your word

607
00:36:15,934 --> 00:36:18,676
that you will never
freeze me out like this again.

608
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,220
I swear.

609
00:36:24,363 --> 00:36:25,363
Good.

610
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,314
So is this everything?

611
00:36:34,245 --> 00:36:36,677
You sure you don't want me
to walk you through it?

612
00:36:38,565 --> 00:36:41,365
I just want to get a sense
of where we stand.

613
00:36:41,661 --> 00:36:43,659
If I have any questions,
I'll ask you later.

614
00:37:09,903 --> 00:37:12,753
Why are they putting
you in a coma on purpose?

615
00:37:13,006 --> 00:37:16,776
Your brain seems fine. It's not
like you think you're Napoléon.

616
00:37:17,239 --> 00:37:19,070
You don't think
you're Napoléon, do you?

617
00:37:20,555 --> 00:37:23,937
There was some swelling
when they brought me in. Now it's...

618
00:37:24,104 --> 00:37:27,662
pushing against my skull.
They say this is gonna relieve it.

619
00:37:31,545 --> 00:37:34,127
- So how long are you gonna be out?
- A couple of days.

620
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:37,971
And you know where you're gonna be?

621
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,410
With Danny.

622
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,010
Actually, I was thinking
about bringing him back.

623
00:37:42,177 --> 00:37:43,177
No way.

624
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,888
It's been three days.
Nothing's happened.

625
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:48,538
I'm starting to think
you were wrong.

626
00:37:49,062 --> 00:37:50,726
We're not taking any chances.

627
00:37:53,726 --> 00:37:57,608
You know what? If I gotta drive you
out of town myself, I'm gonna do it.

628
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,466
If it'll keep you
from killing yourself,

629
00:38:01,633 --> 00:38:03,281
I will go stay with Danny.

630
00:38:04,388 --> 00:38:05,388
Thank you.

631
00:38:10,831 --> 00:38:13,631
You're easy to get along with,
you know that?

632
00:38:42,339 --> 00:38:43,988
You don't seem surprised to see me.

633
00:38:47,495 --> 00:38:49,382
Don't bother running upstairs.

634
00:38:49,883 --> 00:38:51,203
I already found your gun.

635
00:38:56,526 --> 00:38:57,526
Come on.

636
00:38:58,228 --> 00:39:01,839
After all this time, there's gotta be
something you want to say to me.

637
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:03,758
Go to hell.

638
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:10,070
Couldn't you come up with
something more original than that?

639
00:39:12,909 --> 00:39:16,395
I guess all this suburban living
forces you to think in clichés.

640
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:18,879
So it was you.

641
00:39:19,524 --> 00:39:20,691
You ran over Nick.

642
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:26,155
Would you believe me
if I told you it was an accident?

643
00:39:26,673 --> 00:39:29,158
I sent Danny away.
You will never find him.

644
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,508
That's okay.

645
00:39:30,675 --> 00:39:33,788
We're not that close,
seeing as how you stole him from me.

646
00:39:38,287 --> 00:39:39,543
Are you gonna kill me?

647
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:46,668
I need you alive.

648
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:51,263
You are gonna do me a favor.

649
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,433
What kind of favor?

650
00:39:55,765 --> 00:39:57,816
Can we discuss it in the morning?

651
00:39:57,983 --> 00:40:01,005
I've had an exhausting couple of days,
what with searching your house

652
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:03,901
for firearms and running down
Dudley douche bag.

653
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,364
So...

654
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:13,452
- which way to the guest room?
- You think I'm gonna let you stay here?

655
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,502
How are you gonna stop me?

656
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:19,417
If you call the cops,
they'll arrest you and lover boy.

657
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,169
Aren't you afraid
I'll kill you in your sleep?

658
00:40:24,212 --> 00:40:26,610
If the last 20 years
have taught us anything,

659
00:40:26,777 --> 00:40:28,884
it's that you're not
comfortable killing people.

660
00:40:33,316 --> 00:40:35,182
And if you decide to run away,

661
00:40:35,757 --> 00:40:39,045
just make sure you stop by the hospital
and say good-bye to Nick, because,

662
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:41,397
he won't be around much longer
after you've gone.

663
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:44,025
Patrick, please, don't hurt him.

664
00:40:44,571 --> 00:40:46,571
Just do what I tell you, baby,

665
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:48,588
and I'll let you both live.

666
00:40:50,704 --> 00:40:52,786
<i>Mysterious men...</i>

667
00:40:54,074 --> 00:40:55,641
<i>they make promises</i>

668
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,414
<i>they have no intention of keeping.</i>

669
00:41:01,609 --> 00:41:04,595
<i>They tell lies
to get what they want.</i>

670
00:41:08,126 --> 00:41:11,585
<i>They may be more dangerous
than they seem.</i>

671
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:15,410
<i>Yes,</i>

672
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:18,705
<i>our mothers told us we cannot trust</i>

673
00:41:18,872 --> 00:41:20,770
<i>the men we don't know.</i>

674
00:41:22,595 --> 00:41:24,145
<i>And those we do know?</i>

675
00:41:25,155 --> 00:41:26,155
<i>Well,</i>

676
00:41:26,457 --> 00:41:30,039
<i>we can't always trust them either.</i>
