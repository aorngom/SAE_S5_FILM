1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:01,500
Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,900
I just want to move this place fast.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,900
I'll call you tomorrow.

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:05,800
Edie, wait.

5
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:09,100
It's so incomprehensible to me that
Edie Britt would try to destroy us.

6
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,900
For 5 grand, she's hurt.

7
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:11,900
10 grand, she's gone.

8
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,700
Some neighbors hired help...

9
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,500
how am I supposed to pull off
a formal dinner with no warning?

10
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,200
I don't know.

11
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,500
And some helped themselves.

12
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,703
I hate that she's always watching us.

13
00:00:20,703 --> 00:00:22,800
Some just couldn't stop.

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,400
Smile, Gabrielle.

15
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,300
And one...

16
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
didn't stop in time.

17
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,000
Oh, Andrew, I need your help, honey.

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,300
Mama?

19
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,100
There is a widely read book that tells
us everyone is a sinner.

20
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,200
Of course, not everyone who reads this book
feels guilt over the bad things they do,

21
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,700
but Bree Van De Kamp did.

22
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,600
In fact, Bree had spent most of her life feeling guilty.

23
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,000
As a child, she felt guilty about not getting straight A's.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,800
As a teenager, she felt guilty about
letting her boyfriend go to second base.

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:11,000
As a newlywed, she felt guilty about taking
three weeks to get out her thank-you cards.

26
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,800
But she knew the transgressions of her past

27
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,300
were nothing compared with the sin she was about to commit.

28
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,100
Can't we just go to the police and tell them it was an accident?

29
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,600
This wasn't some simple DUI.

30
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,200
Not only was your brother drinking,
Andrew left the scene of the crime.

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
That makes it a hit-and-run.

32
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,000
Maybe I could go to Canada.

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
You know, until the statute of limitations is up.

34
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,400
You really think mom and dad are going to foot the
bill while you go moose hunting for seven years?

35
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,600
If Carlos's mother dies, there is no statute of limitations.

36
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,000
Right, because then it's murder.

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,500
Shut up!

38
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,900
You shut up.

39
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,400
How could it be murder?
It was an accident!

40
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,500
We have to get rid of the car.

41
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,900
But we can't sell it.

42
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,200
The police might find it, and there could be DNA.

43
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,000
We'll take the car to a bad part of town,

44
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
we'll leave the keys in the ignition
and the doors unlocked.

45
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,000
If the police don't find it, we'll get
the insurance money, and if they do,

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,100
it wasn't in our possession.

47
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,700
Anyone could have hit Mrs. Solis.

48
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,800
That sounds good.

49
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,500
Bree, are you sure?

50
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,700
Our son could spend the rest of his life in jail.

51
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,300
I won't allow that.

52
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,500
Bree knew what she was about to do was wrong,

53
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,300
but like most sinners, she would
worry about her guilt tomorrow.

54
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:35,000
Well, everybody should go wash up.

55
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,300
We're having pancakes for breakfast.

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,000
<font color=F62B97>Episode 8 : Guilty

57
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:27,900
Not since my own suicide had violence intruded
upon the serenity of life on Wisteria Lane

58
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,700
in such a conspicuous fashion.

59
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,300
Needless to say, my friends attacked
the problem head-on.

60
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,200
Lynette brought the broom,

61
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,700
Susan brought the trash bags,

62
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,900
and Bree brought the industrial-strength solvent.

63
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,800
Whoo. That stuff is strong.

64
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,700
It has to be.

65
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,500
I don't want Gabrielle and Carlos coming home
to this ugly reminder in front of their house.

66
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,100
So has anyone been over there?

67
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,300
Julie and I went over this morning.

68
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,200
How's Juanita doing?

69
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,900
She's been in a coma ever since
she came out of the E.R.

70
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,500
Nobody knows when, or even if, she'll wake up.

71
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,000
This is awful. Carlos must be just devastated.

72
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I hope she wakes up soon. Maybe she can
tell us who was driving that car.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,600
We can only hope.

74
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:15,800
Slow down, you jerk!
This is a residential neighborhood!

75
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,700
Wow, that's quite a pitching arm you've got there.

76
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,900
It pisses me off.
I've got four kids, you know?

77
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,100
I was up all night reading statistics on line.

78
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,900
1 out of every 4 traffic accidents
happens on residential streets.

79
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,600
I hope whoever hit Juanita gets put away for life.

80
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,000
Don't you think that's a little bit extreme?

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,700
An innocent woman gets hit by a car
and the driver just takes off?

82
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,300
I don't think it's extreme.

83
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,200
You should go home and get some rest, eat something.

84
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,900
You have a ton of messages from work.
Tanaka called, said it was urgent.

85
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,600
Carlos, I can stay here with your mother.

86
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,600
I need to be here if she wakes up.

87
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
You can't go on like this.

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You have to take care of yourself.

89
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,400
What if she dies?

90
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,400
People slip into comas all the time and never come out.

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,700
Don't say that.

92
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,500
We need to stay positive.

93
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,000
Mr. and Mrs. Solis?

94
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,700
John.

95
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,900
Is it okay if I come in?

96
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,800
Of course.

97
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,600
Mr. Solis, uh...

98
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
I'm so sorry this happened.

99
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
It means a lot that you came.

100
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,100
Look, I think I'm going to go
down to the chapel and pray.

101
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,900
You want to come?

102
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:48,000
Um, no.

103
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,300
I think I will stay here with mama.

104
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,800
Is it all right if I come?

105
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,200
Of course.

106
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,500
We need all the prayers we can get.

107
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:14,002
Mrs. Solis, it's time for her sponge bath.

108
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,300
Come again?

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,700
Sometimes family members prefer to
administer sponge baths themselves.

110
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,900
I think I'll pass.

111
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,700
Martha.

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,900
Where's your purse?

113
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,100
Over there. Why?

114
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,900
What are you doing?

115
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,300
I am taking back the $40 that
you stole out of my purse.

116
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,000
Edie.

117
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,500
We both know you did it.
Now hand it over!

118
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,200
I have taken nothing from your purse.

119
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,200
And if you're missing money, I'd ask one of those
strange men you parade through here at all hours.

120
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,300
I am not going to apologize for having a healthy sex life.

121
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:01,800
Healthy?

122
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,500
I'm going to have to burn every sheet you've touched.

123
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,100
I want my money.

124
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,900
And I want those nonfat peach yogurts.

125
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,500
They didn't just walk out of that fridge by themselves.

126
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:14,200
Well, you can deduct it from the $40
that you're going to give me now.

127
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,600
You're my best friend.

128
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,400
Why would I steal from you?

129
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,300
It's no secret that you've been
having financial problems.

130
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,600
I hear you bitching on the phone to your bank.

131
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
That's it.

132
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:29,000
I can put up with your debauchery and your
food theft, but I will not tolerate spying.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,900
I want you out.

134
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,800
You don't mean that.

135
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,300
Oh, yes, I do.

136
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,700
I'm leaving tomorrow to visit my sister for a few days.

137
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,900
I want you gone by the time I get back.

138
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,900
I'll do you one better.

139
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,500
I will leave today.

140
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,500
I hope this works.

141
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,900
My sleep cycle is totally out of whack.

142
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:01,400
I'm up all night, and then dozing off during the day.

143
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
Trust me. This'll do the trick.

144
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,302
In fact, you should be feeling more relaxed already.

145
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,203
You know, you're right.

146
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:13,700
Boys, I can hear you out there. Now be quiet.

147
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,900
Just sit there and color.

148
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,100
Now is not a good time to be moving.

149
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,800
Right. Sorry.

150
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,100
Just block everything out

151
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,000
and let it go.

152
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,900
Imagine that you're in a forest.

153
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,800
There's a babbling brook nearby,

154
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,800
and the wind is just coming through the trees.

155
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Mommy.

156
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,000
Parker.

157
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,900
I don't know --

158
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,500
ow -- what you think you're doing,

159
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,900
but put that back where it belongs.

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Sorry.

161
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,800
You were saying something about wind.

162
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:52,500
I was just creating a soothing image.

163
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,000
Oh, for the love of god.

164
00:08:57,400 --> 00:09:00,700
Knock it off, you little monsters.

165
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
Mrs. Scavo, please lie down.

166
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,000
We need to finish this.

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Look, I'm on my last nerve, so I'm
going to level with you here.

168
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,900
I've screwed up my entire system by
taking my kids' A.D.D. medication.

169
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
Yeah, that's right. You heard me.

170
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,500
I plan to stop, but right now, I need to sleep,

171
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:24,300
and I need more than a few crappy
needles, so what do you got?

172
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,500
I'm not licensed to write prescriptions.

173
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,300
I know you're not.

174
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,000
This will put you right to sleep.

175
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,200
It's a very powerful herbal remedy.

176
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,600
Now, promise me you're going to use it judiciously.

177
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
Sure. Whatever.

178
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,200
Knock, knock.

179
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,900
Hey, come on in.

180
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,900
You're a mess.

181
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,500
I-I'm tearing out these leaky pipes
in the upstairs bathroom.

182
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,700
Wall to wall rotten wood.

183
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,800
Hmm, sounds like a job.

184
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,000
So Julie said that you came by before?

185
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,800
Um, yeah. Uh...

186
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,300
I was thinking about driving up to the Germani
Vineyard tomorrow for this wine tasting, and, uh...

187
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,100
What time do you want me to be ready?

188
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,400
About 6:00.

189
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,100
6:00 is good.

190
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,000
All right.

191
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,300
You know, I thought maybe afterwards, we could
have a little dinner, maybe some dancing.

192
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,100
Sounds great.

193
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,200
Um, you do know that it's, like,
a 2-hour drive up there,

194
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:34,400
and isn't that kind of late to be coming back?

195
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,100
I thought if, you know, worse came to worst,
we could grab a room.

196
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,100
Oh?

197
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,500
Like a hotel room?

198
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Yeah, as a last resort.

199
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,400
Of course. Of course, yes.

200
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,900
So maybe we should make reservations.
You know, just in case.

201
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,400
Yeah, I found some hotels online.
Let me get the printout.

202
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,200
Hey, Bongo. Come here.

203
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,300
You want a treat?

204
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,500
Hey, Mike, where do you keep the dog biscuits?

205
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,500
I'm sorry, what?

206
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,200
Oh, never mind.

207
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,400
We'll just find them ourselves, huh?

208
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,500
We're going to find them ourselves.

209
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,800
I'm sorry, Susan. I couldn't hear you. What'd you say?

210
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,400
Nothing.

211
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,500
It's not important.

212
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,800
It's my tile guy. Here, see what looks good.

213
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,500
Hey, Phil.

214
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,500
Um, no, no, tomorrow morning I'm making a lumber run.

215
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,900
It's no good.

216
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,600
Uh, nope, I'm gone tomorrow night, too.

217
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,400
I could let him in.

218
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,700
No, that's okay. Thanks.

219
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,800
No, it's fine.

220
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Just give me the key.

221
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
I'll be around all day.

222
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,400
All right, um, thanks.

223
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,000
Phil, I'll give a key to my, uh, neighbor.

224
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
She'll be here to let you in.

225
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,400
Like every city, Fairview had a neighborhood
that was less than desirable.

226
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:10,000
It was an accepted fact anyone who lingered
there after midnight was usually up to no good.

227
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,000
Rex and Bree Van De Kamp were no exception.

228
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,300
You really think this is going to work?

229
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:30,500
& nbsp;

230
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,100
This is the most impoverished
neighborhood in the city.

231
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,300
Trust me, somebody will steal the car.

232
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,000
How can you be so sure?

233
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,600
Because I have faith in the poor.

234
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,700
She's so beautiful.

235
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,500
I shot this last year on her birthday.

236
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,000
How are you going to do it?

237
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,200
I made contact with her at a bar.

238
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,600
She thinks I'm a real estate developer.

239
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,500
Is she going to suffer?

240
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,900
No.

241
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,200
Edie Britt will disappear,
and you'll go back to your life.

242
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,300
Before you do it,

243
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,400
do you think you could ask her why
she sent this note to my wife?

244
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,300
You can't think like that, Mr. Young.
You can't give in to your curiosity.

245
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,500
Curiosity leads to guilt.

246
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Guilt leads to talking.

247
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,900
You still have questions?

248
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,000
I want to be clear about something --

249
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
I walk away with this cash, it's done.

250
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,000
No refunds, no buyer's remorse.

251
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,500
I get it.

252
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:33,400
We won't talk again, so I'll ask one more time.

253
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,000
Are you sure you want this?

254
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,000
My wife is dead because of Edie Britt.

255
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,900
I absolutely want this.

256
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,200
You've been awfully quiet.

257
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,000
I've just been...

258
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,700
thinking about the kids.

259
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,600
They sure grew up quickly, didn't they?

260
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,700
They sure did.

261
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,300
I remember telling them when they were babies
that they weren't allowed to get any bigger

262
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,600
because they were so adorable,

263
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,200
and we were so happy.

264
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,500
Yeah, well...

265
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,800
they sure didn't turn out like we expected them to.

266
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,500
No.

267
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,300
They didn't.

268
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,500
We could have been better parents.

269
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,100
We weren't that bad.

270
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,500
We still have so much to teach them.

271
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,800
For starters, we need to get across to
Andrew the enormity of what he's done.

272
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,500
I-I suppose we could punish him.

273
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:42,500
All right, well, what's the appropriate punishment
for a child who drives over a woman?

274
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,900
I-I don't know.

275
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,900
You know no matter how the kids turn out,
I still love them.

276
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,700
Of course you do.

277
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:56,400
But I'll never forgive them for growing up so quickly.

278
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,600
Hey. Look.

279
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,500
And then I opened the cabinet,
and there was all this money in it.

280
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,100
I mean, there was wads of it.

281
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:21,900
That's why you're freaking out?

282
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,000
A few stacks of cash? Come on.

283
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,900
Well, what? Realistically, I've
known this guy a few weeks.

284
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,400
I mean, he could be a hit man for the mob.

285
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,500
If you really think that, why are
you going on a trip with him?

286
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,100
I never get out of the house.

287
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,200
Mom, if you really need something to freak out about,

288
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,400
just remember you're going to spend
the night with Mike in a hotel.

289
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,500
No man has seen you naked
in years except your doctor.

290
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,900
Yeah, and he retired. I try
not to take that personally.

291
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
You look old in that.

292
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,000
Oh.

293
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
Maybe I am being silly.

294
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,800
But going to a hotel with a man is a big deal to me.

295
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,400
What if Mike is hiding something?

296
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,900
Like what?

297
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,100
I don't know.

298
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,600
That's dad.

299
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,400
I got to go.

300
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Now, listen to me.

301
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,000
No more freaking out.
I need this weekend to go well.

302
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,800
Why do you care so much?

303
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,200
Because I'm going to have a
husband of my own someday,

304
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:11,500
and I really don't want you living with us.

305
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,000
Are the lady fingers okay?

306
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,300
Oh, they're terrific.

307
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,300
We just appreciate y'all stopping by.

308
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,900
Well, we just wanted you to know how much we care.

309
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,900
So have the police come up with any leads?

310
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,000
Not really.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,300
They'll be able to determine the
make and model of the car,

312
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,300
but without any eyewitnesses,
no one seems very optimistic.

313
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,800
Well, more importantly, is there
any good news about Juanita?

314
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,900
No change.

315
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,600
All we can do is wait and hope for the best.

316
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,600
We put her on our prayer list at church.

317
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,800
Oh, that's very sweet, Danielle. Thank you.

318
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:51,500
It must really help during times like these --

319
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
having kids.

320
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,200
Yeah, they're a blessing.

321
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,200
Children make everything worthwhile.

322
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,000
You guys are the future.

323
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Legacy.

324
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,200
Thanks.

325
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,500
After we're all dead, you'll be
the only ones left to carry on.

326
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:12,400
Gabrielle and I are about to start a family.

327
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,600
Oh, hey, that-- that's great.

328
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,100
When did you decide this?

329
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,400
It's a fairly recent development.

330
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,900
I see.

331
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,300
We'll talk about this later.

332
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,600
Face it,

333
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,000
we're shallow people.

334
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,100
I mean, can our lives have any meaning
if all we ever do is buy stuff?

335
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,800
That depends on what we buy.

336
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:33,700
I want a child.

337
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,300
In case you've forgotten, before we
got married, we made a deal.

338
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,200
No kids.

339
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,300
Yeah, well, deals were meant to be renegotiated.

340
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,700
Well, we're not negotiating my uterus.

341
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,600
We should probably be going.

342
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,600
Yeah. Mm.

343
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,500
Thank you so much.

344
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,800
That was weird.

345
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,600
I feel awful for Carlos.

346
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,300
That talk about children is obviously
coming from his grief.

347
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,400
Whatever.

348
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,800
I'm off the hook.

349
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:12,800
A weary Lynette drank her potent tea in hopes of
finally finding the sleep that had eluded her.

350
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,200
Unfortunately for Lynette,

351
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,200
there would be no rest for the weary.

352
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,200
Go to hell.

353
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,900
Go to hell, go to hell, go to hell,
go to hell, go to hell.

354
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Sorry we're late. Kenny Litman
couldn't find his neckerchief.

355
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,500
Come on, guys.

356
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,900
Lori Jean, the scout meeting is today?

357
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,500
Mommy.

358
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,300
What? Oh.

359
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,000
Right. Okay, boys.

360
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,100
This knot is called the bowline.

361
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,200
It is a remarkably useful knot.

362
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,800
Now, pick up your ropes.

363
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,100
Okay, first, we cross this end over here,

364
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,800
and then we make a loop,

365
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,800
and then another loop,

366
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,000
and then you sort of pull it through, I'm guessing,

367
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
and then you just -- ready?

368
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,600
Yank it taut.

369
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,000
Mommy, that doesn't look like the picture.

370
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,800
You're never going to be a sailor. What do you care?

371
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,500
Okay, everybody, let's just take a break.

372
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,600
Thanks.

373
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,000
Okay. It's all up there.

374
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Can I get a signature?

375
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,300
Oh, of course.

376
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,700
Thank you very much.

377
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,800
Here you go.

378
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,700
Have a nice weekend.

379
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,400
You too, lady.

380
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,900
Hey, ma'am! You still here?

381
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:41,700
I forgot to give you a receipt!

382
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,200
Ma'am?

383
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,600
Hello?!

384
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,400
I need help! I'm up here!

385
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,100
I'm trapped in the floor! Hello!

386
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,500
If you came in here to judge me,you can just leave.

387
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,800
Wait! Wait! No.

388
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,900
Wait. Don't -- don't go.
Wait, I have an idea.

389
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,700
Here, here, here.

390
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,000
Here. Grab the towel, Bongo.

391
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,400
Come on, grab the other end.

392
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,100
Good boy.

393
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,000
That's it. Get the other end.

394
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Come on, Bongo!

395
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,500
Pull the other end! Come on, Bongo!

396
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,100
What are you doing? Bongo, over here!

397
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,300
Bongo?

398
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,400
Oh --oh, don't do that. Oh, Bongo.

399
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,600
While Susan remained hopelessly stuck,

400
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Gabrielle was moving to confront the issue
of her young lover's restless conscience...

401
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,100
Nobody's home.

402
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,700
I know. I've been watching.

403
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,900
I came to talk to you.

404
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,600
Although she would need to be discreet.

405
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,700
Keep working.

406
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,900
What were you thinking, showing up at the hospital?

407
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,500
I had to see if she was okay.

408
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,000
You need to keep a low profile right now.

409
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,500
Look... you and I are finished.

410
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,700
From now on, I'm sticking with Danielle.

411
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,100
Why would you say that?

412
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,000
I hate myself for what we did.

413
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,700
Okay, I can't sleep at night.

414
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,200
I've got to make a clean break.

415
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,700
We weren't driving the car.

416
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,200
We didn't chase Juanita into the street.

417
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,300
She wouldn't have been there if
we weren't having an affair.

418
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,200
Oh, for god's sakes, between you and Carlos...

419
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,700
listen to me carefully. You didn't do anything wrong.

420
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,000
That's not what Father Crowley thinks.

421
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,200
What?

422
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,000
I went to confession.

423
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,500
Have you lost your mind?

424
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,400
What did you tell him?

425
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,100
Everything.

426
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,100
Including...

427
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,800
in the alley behind the truck stop?

428
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,500
Everything.

429
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,000
Oh, damn you.

430
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,800
What is wrong with you?

431
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Lassie would have had a fire truck here by now,

432
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,100
you stupid dog.

433
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,500
Good boy, Bongo!

434
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Run, Bongo, run! Go get help!

435
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,100
Andrew, um...

436
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:43,400
I know the last few days
have been stressful, and, uh...

437
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,800
you know, if you ever need to talk to anybody...

438
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,500
I know, I know. You and dad are here for me.

439
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,000
Actually, I was thinking we could arrange
for you to talk to a professional.

440
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
A shrink?

441
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,900
You think I'm crazy?

442
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,500
Of course not.

443
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,800
It's just that the accident probably
stirred up a lot of emotions,

444
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:08,800
and it would be normal for you to be feeling
confused or depressed or ashamed.

445
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,600
I'm cool.

446
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,100
Um, really.

447
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,900
Honey, you put a woman into a coma.

448
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,700
Surely that arouses some kind of emotion.

449
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,500
Yeah, well, it doesn't.

450
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,600
Now, if you'll excuse me...

451
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:25,200
No, I won't. Not until you tell me.

452
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,100
Why do you care?

453
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:29,000
Because I need to know that you're not a monster.

454
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,100
You want to know how I feel?

455
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,600
Yeah.

456
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,100
Okay, here goes.

457
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,400
I feel bad that she got hurt,

458
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
but I also feel bad that my car got dinged

459
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,700
because somebody didn't have enough sense to
look both ways before she crossed the street.

460
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:46,300
And I also feel bad that now I'm going
to have to ride my bike to school.

461
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,100
Andrew, you almost killed another human being.

462
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,400
She's an old lady, okay?

463
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,200
She's lived her life.

464
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,800
I have my whole life ahead of me,
and now it might be screwed up.

465
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,700
That's what you should be worried about.

466
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:05,100
What I'm worried about, Andrew, is that
you don't seem to have a soul.

467
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,400
Give me one good reason why I
shouldn't call the police.

468
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,700
Because I'm your son.

469
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
That would make you the monster.

470
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,600
Hey, buddy.

471
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,900
Susan, is that you?

472
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,900
Mike? I'm upstairs... sort of.

473
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,800
Hang on. I'll -- I'll be right up.

474
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
What happened?

475
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,900
Well, see, this bird, um...

476
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,300
flew in your bathroom window,

477
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:04,200
and I tried to save it, but, uh...

478
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,100
it died.

479
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,000
I don't think that's what happened.

480
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,200
I don't think so, either.

481
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,600
Can you just help me get out of here, please?

482
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,000
Come on.

483
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,100
Thank you.

484
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,100
You have no idea what that was like.

485
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,500
You went through my cabinets.

486
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,800
What?

487
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:33,200
Oh, I can explain that.

488
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,600
Get out of my house.

489
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,400
Mike --

490
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,200
Get out.

491
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,100
Hello there.

492
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,700
Good afternoon.

493
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:14,700
Oh. Well, isn't this just as pretty as a picture book.

494
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,200
Well, the plan is to put in a small condo.

495
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,300
You want to make some money,
or you want to pussyfoot around?

496
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,700
What do you suggest?

497
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,200
I'm thinking strip mall.

498
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,100
I've run some numbers.

499
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,300
Nice stationery.

500
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,500
Oh, it's stolen.

501
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,800
What do you mean?

502
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,500
After my house burned down, I was staying
with this neighbor Martha Huber.

503
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,200
That is, until the old troll threw me out.

504
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,500
Anyway, I'd steal her stuff, she'd steal mine.

505
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
It's the circle of life.

506
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,500
So this paper is hers.

507
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,800
Oh, god, yes.

508
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,200
No, Tom, you can't do this to me.

509
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,400
Because I need you home.

510
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,700
Boys, stop it! I am on the phone!

511
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:20,200
Well, yeah, I-I realize it's not your fault
that the meeting got postponed,

512
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,400
but you promised you'd be back tonight.

513
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,600
I-I-I got to go. The kids are --

514
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,300
yeah, I know you're sorry.

515
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:33,800
Just will you try and get back as soon as you can?

516
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
Okay. Bye.

517
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,500
Boys, would you please, please stop it?

518
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,400
Really, really, mommy's got a headache, okay?

519
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,900
Just -- ugh.

520
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,400
turn that damn thing off!

521
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,700
What's the matter with you?!

522
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,700
Why won't you listen to me?!

523
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,800
You want noise?!

524
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,500
What?

525
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,500
I just came over to say I'm sorry,

526
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,100
and I'll pay for all the damage.

527
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,100
Don't worry about it.

528
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,000
Well, so...

529
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,300
in your mind, I-is the date off?

530
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,200
Well, you snooped around my house
and went through my stuff.

531
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,600
Yeah, in my book, that's pretty much a deal breaker.

532
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,700
Hold on a minute.

533
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,400
Now, I started snooping around

534
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,700
because I found all that money by accident,

535
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:31,500
and then I found a gun.

536
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,800
Are you a drug dealer or something?

537
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,500
Is that what you think?

538
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,200
Well, I wouldn't know, because you never let me in.

539
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,200
You know, there's this whole part of your life
that you keep completely walled off.

540
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,100
I have a gun for protection.
I keep cash for emergencies.

541
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,700
I'm a good guy,

542
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,100
Susan, and you should know that.

543
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,900
I'm -- I'm not obligated to share every
little detail of my life with you.

544
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,400
Well, every little detail is one thing.

545
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,300
You know, weird, creepy secrets, that's another.

546
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,000
I don't want to be with somebody who doesn't trust me.

547
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,200
Well, maybe we shouldn't be dating.

548
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,500
Maybe we shouldn't.

549
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,500
Do you mean that?

550
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,800
Yeah.

551
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,700
Well, I hope that your, you know, little
secret keeps you warm at night,

552
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:07,700
because you're throwing something
really great away to protect it.

553
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,500
Susan, you got to take my kids for a while.

554
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,800
Lynette, this just really isn't the time --

555
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,700
no, no, I'm sorry, but I can't do this.

556
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,500
It's just --it's too much.

557
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,900
Boys, you stay with your aunt Susan.

558
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:33,300
Lynette, you know, when are you coming back?

559
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,300
Lynette?!

560
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Lynette!

561
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
There's Lynette's car. She's got to be close.

562
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,800
I hope the kids aren't too much for Danielle to handle.

563
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,300
She'll be fine.

564
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,300
What do you think's happening with Lynette?

565
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,300
I don't know, but I'm scared.

566
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,500
Something's very, very wrong.

567
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,600
Lynette, honey?

568
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,100
Are you okay?

569
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,200
Father.

570
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,500
I'm -- I'm so glad you could
come and pray for mama.

571
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,000
Please, sit, sit.

572
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Thank you, Gabrielle.

573
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,500
Listen, since you're here,

574
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,500
there's something I've always wondered about.

575
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:55,500
That whole thing about priests not being allowed
to repeat what they hear in confessions --

576
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:59,000
is that a hard rule or just a general guide line?

577
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,100
Rest assured, everyone's secrets are safe.

578
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,900
That's good to hear.

579
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,600
I'll keep yours, too, if you want to talk.

580
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,500
Oh, me?

581
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
No, no.

582
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,500
Confession's not really my thing.

583
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,600
That's a shame.

584
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,500
Okay, you can stop condemning me with your eyes.

585
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,700
Right now.

586
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,000
I know you know about the affair,

587
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,800
but you know nothing about my life.

588
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,500
Look, it's not even an issue anymore.
John and I are finished.

589
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,300
Gabrielle, the church is pretty clear on this.

590
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,000
If you commit a mortal sin and
you die without repenting,

591
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,700
you go to hell.

592
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:47,000
Well, aren't you just a ball of fun.

593
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,800
So if I confess, it'll clean the slate, right?

594
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,900
Not only that.

595
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,700
If you want god's forgiveness,
you have to be truly sorry,

596
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,800
and you have to promise not to commit the sin again.

597
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:05,300
So what happens if I repent later,

598
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,400
like, say, when I'm 75?

599
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,500
I wouldn't recommend waiting.
What if you die before then?

600
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,300
Well, let's say I don't die.

601
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,000
I do yoga, I eat well.

602
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,300
If I wait, does my repenting still count?

603
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,200
If you mean it, yes.

604
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
Thank you, father Crowley.

605
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,900
You have been a tremendous comfort.

606
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,300
Um, I will let you do your thing.

607
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,900
Gabrielle.

608
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:35,000
You know, we're all responsible
for the choices we make.

609
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,300
Don't you want to be a good person?

610
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,800
What I want is to be happy.

611
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,500
That's the answer of a selfish child.

612
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,900
I know.

613
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,000
Then I started taking the pills
because they gave me energy,

614
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,700
but then I couldn't sleep at night,

615
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,300
and I was getting so tired in the daytime,

616
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:04,300
and it totally messed me up.

617
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,100
I love my kids so much.

618
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,800
I'm so sorry they have me as a mother.

619
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,700
Lynette, you are a great mother.

620
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,700
No, I'm not.

621
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,800
I can't do it.

622
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,700
I'm so tired of feeling like a failure.

623
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,000
It's so humiliating.

624
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,400
No, it's not.

625
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,400
So you got addicted to your
kids' A.D.D. medication.

626
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,500
It happens.

627
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,600
You've got four kids. That's a lot of stress.

628
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,400
Honey, you just need some help.

629
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,600
That's what's so humiliating.

630
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,000
Other moms don't need help.

631
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,700
Other moms make it look so easy.

632
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,300
All I do is complain.

633
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,800
That's not true.

634
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,400
When -- when Julie was a baby,

635
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,000
I-I was out of my mind almost every day.

636
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,200
I used to get so upset when Andrew
and Danielle were little,

637
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,200
I used their nap times to cry.

638
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,900
Why didn't you ever tell me this?

639
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,300
Oh, baby.

640
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,700
Nobody likes to admit that they
can't handle the pressure.

641
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,500
I think it's just like we think, you know,

642
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
it's easier to keep it all in.

643
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,600
Oh, we shouldn't.

644
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:19,100
We should tell each other this stuff.

645
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:21,900
It helps, huh?

646
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,400
Yeah.

647
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,400
It really does.

648
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,900
So it was Martha Huber all along.

649
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,800
Seems so.

650
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,900
Edie didn't move in with Huber until after
your wife received the blackmail note.

651
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:48,800
My god. We almost killed an innocent woman.

652
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,300
Like I said, I don't do refunds,

653
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,600
but if you'd like,

654
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,500
I'm willing to pay Mrs. Huber a visit.

655
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,500
No. Just keep the money.

656
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,000
This whole thing's been tearing me up --

657
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,400
the nightmares, the guilt.

658
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,300
This isn't what Mary Alice would have wanted.

659
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,600
What would she have wanted?

660
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,400
Answers.

661
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,800
Hello, Mrs. Huber.

662
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:19,900
Paul.

663
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,900
Let me give you a hand.

664
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,800
That's really not necessary.

665
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,700
I insist.

666
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Ants, huh?

667
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,500
Yes. I've had a little infestation problem.

668
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,200
I wanted to take care of it before I left on my trip.

669
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,400
Never had a problem with ants.

670
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,400
Mary Alice and I had these little black flies once.

671
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:40,900
Oh?

672
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:42,500
She was so funny about it.

673
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,700
She ran out and bought herself a can of
poison something to spray them down,

674
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,500
so she's taking aim at one on
the counter, and she just,

675
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,000
stops, puts the can down.

676
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,600
Couldn't do it.

677
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,900
She told me later it felt too personal.

678
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,200
She truly couldn't kill a fly.

679
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,900
That's how gentle she was.

680
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,700
Then you must have lived with quite a few flies.

681
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:08,400
I'm going to have to say good
night to you now, Paul.

682
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,300
What are you doing here?

683
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,400
I want to know why.

684
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,400
I know you've got a lot of questions,

685
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,400
and I also know I don't want to lose you,

686
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,000
so ask me anything you want.

687
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,400
You just told me everything I need to know.

688
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,800
All right.

689
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,600
My idiot husband died and left
me with a worthless pension.

690
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:58,600
I was desperate for money,

691
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,800
and it's better to take it from
a bad person than a good one.

692
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,400
How was I supposed to know she'd shoot herself?

693
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,200
She was a good person.

694
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,800
A good person who leaves her child motherless?

695
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,700
Read the bible, Paul. Suicide's a big no-no.

696
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,700
Don't you feel any remorse what so ever?

697
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,000
Why should I?

698
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,600
Your wife didn't kill herself because I wrote a note.

699
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:20,200
She killed herself because of what
she did to that poor baby.

700
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,800
But rest assured,

701
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,400
I'm praying for Mary Alice.

702
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:29,300
After what she did, she'll need all of our prayers.

703
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,500
There is a widely read book that
tells us everyone is a sinner.

704
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:32,500
Of course, not everyone feels guilt
over the bad things they do.

705
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:38,300
In contrast, there are those who assume
more than their share of the blame.

706
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:49,600
There are others who soothe their consciences
with small acts of kindness...

707
00:41:55,900 --> 00:42:00,400
or by telling themselves their sins were justified.

708
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:08,300
Finally, there are the ones who simply
vow to do better next time

709
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,200
and pray for forgiveness.

710
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,300
Sometimes their prayers are answered.
