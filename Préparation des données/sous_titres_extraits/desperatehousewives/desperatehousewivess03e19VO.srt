<i>Previously on Desperate Housewives...

2
00:00:02,315 --> 00:00:04,457
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but I'm in love with you.

3
00:00:04,553 --> 00:00:07,090
<i>Victor caught Gaby by surprise...

4
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,760
Why would a four-star chef
wanna slum at a pizza joint?

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:11,280
<i>Lynette took a gamble...

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,370
- He has a history... using cocaine.
- No, no way.

7
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:15,600
Well, but he's been clean
for almost a year.

8
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,180
<i>Mike bet on love...

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,100
I win, you leave me and Susan alone.

10
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:20,191
<i>And lost...

11
00:00:20,248 --> 00:00:21,309
Don't panic.

12
00:00:21,348 --> 00:00:24,200
<i>but still came to Susan's rescue.

13
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,320
You okay?

14
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:32,410
<i>And mrs. Mccluskey revealed her secret
for a lasting relationship.

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:39,880
<i>It was late on a tuesday night when
the power went out all over Fairview.

16
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,200
<i>For most of the residents,
it was a minor inconvenience.

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:51,440
<i>But for those with secrets,
the darkness proved quite useful indeed.

18
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,250
<i>Millie Russell was able to indulge
in another night of midnight binging.

19
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,790
<i>Timmy Cooper was able to sneak another
peek at his father's adult magazines.

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:10,710
<i>Marilyn Quinn was able to steal a few
more puffs of her forbidden tobacco.

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:14,637
<i>But these secrets paled

22
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:19,133
<i>compared to the one a certain
ld woman was hiding in her basement.

23
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,427
You sit tight, Ida.

24
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:22,120
I got batteries here.

25
00:01:23,007 --> 00:01:25,510
No, I keep them in the freezer
for just such an emergency.

26
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,050
I'll run 'em over to you.

27
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,650
By the way, you wouldn't happen to have
any extra ice laying around, would ya?

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,113
No, I've just got some stuff
in my freezer.

29
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,872
I don't want thawing out
anytime soon.

30
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:45,670
<i>Yes, as a rule, darkness helps us
keep our secrets safely hidden.

31
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,470
Oh, crap!

32
00:01:55,248 --> 00:01:57,330
<i>But every rule...

33
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,780
<i>Karen, what's happened?

34
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:00,320
<i>Are you okay?

35
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,090

40
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:46,157
<i>"God, That's Good."

41
00:02:46,948 --> 00:02:49,730
<i>When the lights went out on
Wisteria lane,

42
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,220
<i>Karen Mccluskey wasn't the only
reside left in the dark.

43
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:59,470
<i>Everyone else felt the pain of
going without power as well.

44
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,210
Damn! Thumbtack!

45
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,050
Susan, please let me help.

46
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,560
No, no, I got it.

47
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,410
Oh, wait.

48
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,400
Here we go.

49
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,380
But it's hardly a long-term solution.

50
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:18,897
Well, at least it'll keep me
from stabbing myself while I look.

51
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:20,151
But this is silly.

52
00:03:20,247 --> 00:03:22,813
Why don't we just borrow
a flashlight from Mike?

53
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:27,050
He's a plumber.
He's bound to have a spare.

54
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:31,021
Sure, but we can't keep leaning
on him for everything.

55
00:03:31,193 --> 00:03:32,602
"Mike, we're drowning. Save us."

56
00:03:32,704 --> 00:03:34,310
"Mike, it's dark. Give us a flashlight."

57
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,425
Let's go ask Gaby.

58
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,180
Actually, I wanted to talk
to him anyway.

59
00:03:37,238 --> 00:03:39,000
I thought we might ask
him over for dinner.

60
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,270
Dinner?

61
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,890
You know, as a thank you gesture.

62
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,453
Well, Ian, you've tasted my cooking.

63
00:03:45,568 --> 00:03:47,407
It's not a thank you.
It's revenge.

64
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,188
well, then I'll cook.

65
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:51,560
You know, you told me
I should put my jealousy behind me.

66
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,270
I think breaking bread together
would be a great start.

67
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,160
Well, let's not bother him tonight.

68
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:58,184
You know,  I don't really
even need a flashlight.

69
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:00,813
My eyes have totally
adjusted to the dark.

70
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,660
what was that?

71
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:06,420
Don't walk in the kitchen.

72
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,850
Anyway, where is your sense of romance?

73
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,930
It's a blackout.

74
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:15,010
You have a defenseless lady.

75
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,660
Getting any ideas?

76
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:19,090
Well, I'm starting to, yes.

77
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,370
It's funny.

78
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:24,740
All that time I wasted worrying Mike
would come between us--

79
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,890
It seems so laughable now, doesn't it?

80
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,300
Kiss me.

81
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,530
Hey, Carlos, we had a blackout.

82
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,090
You need a flashlight?

83
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,600
Carlos, you okay?

84
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,720
Uh, sorry, man.

85
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,800
I thought I heard a thud.

86
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:53,810
I just, bumped into a chair.

87
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,930
I didn't think that you were
coming home till tomorrow.

88
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,050
Nah, fish weren't bitin'.

89
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,060
you got a girl in here?

90
00:05:05,841 --> 00:05:06,864
Why?

91
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:11,480
Oh, 'cause when I came home,
I thought I heard sex noises.

92
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,940
No, that was just me.

93
00:05:17,807 --> 00:05:18,926
Night.

94
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,440
oh, God, that was close.

95
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,940
All this sneaking around is ridiculous!

96
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,070
Mike and I dated for... five minutes.

97
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:33,040
He's not gonna care.

98
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,280
What if Travers finds out?

99
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:35,990
Look, I don't want him to be confused,

100
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:39,350
and until we figure out
where this is going, I just...

101
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,373
think we should keep things
on the down low.

102
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,340
Hey, I didn't say we had to stop.

103
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,080
- I just said we had to quiet.
- What?

104
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,336
I suppose we should tiptoe around
like schoolchildren

105
00:05:48,451 --> 00:05:50,609
so our parents don't catch us doing it?

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,300
I feel like I'm 12 again.

107
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,452
I'm just saying, I don't think that
the whole world needs to know our...

108
00:05:55,618 --> 00:05:56,660
12?

109
00:05:56,916 --> 00:05:58,170
Okay, look...

110
00:05:58,934 --> 00:06:02,330
I will find us another place
to rendezvous.

111
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,680
But I'm not gonna skulk
around forever.

112
00:06:05,877 --> 00:06:07,650
And no one's asking you to.

113
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:10,200
I respect you too much for that.

114
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:17,460
If you don't mind...

115
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,080
Oh, for God sake...

116
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,760
I'm gonna be right there.

117
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:36,002
Here you go.

118
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,550
So can you still cook
with the power out?

119
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,360
Of course!

120
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,090
Absolutely!

121
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,144
Please,  tell me we can
still make pizza.

122
00:06:44,183 --> 00:06:45,220
No dice.

123
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,820
Some genius installed pizza
ovens with electric starters.

124
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,730
Oh, this is awful.

125
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:52,390
On a good night, we barely break even.

126
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,060
Tonight is gonna kill the whole week.

127
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,830
Not necessarly.

128
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,400
The stovetop's gas.

129
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:01,090
I bought pasta for the staff dinner.

130
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,280
You give me ten minutes,

131
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:06,010
I'll whip up a spaghetti carbonara
that'll knock their socks off.

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,640
Oh, my God!

133
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,010
You are a lifesaver!

134
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,830
And, uh, since it's not on the menu,

135
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,539
you can charge whatever you want--

136
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,700
say, 20 bucks?

137
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,266
For pasta? Are you crazy?

138
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:21,440
Won't hurt to ask.

139
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:23,480
I don't wanna scare them away.

140
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,662
So...

141
00:07:28,797 --> 00:07:29,800
good news!

142
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,790
Our chef is preparing his special
spaghetti carbonara.

143
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:33,900
Ooh, yummy!

144
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,070
And we're offering that for $12.

145
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,223
Great!

146
00:07:37,377 --> 00:07:38,830
For the appetizer portion.

147
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:40,860
The entrée is $20.

148
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:42,027
- Fine.
- 2.

149
00:07:42,278 --> 00:07:43,596
22.

150
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,760
Shouldn't there be an emergency light?

151
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:55,412
Sometimes in
these elevators there's a...

152
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,066
Well, aren't you clever?

153
00:07:58,085 --> 00:08:00,350
I'll just call hotel security
and let 'em know we're--

154
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:01,770
No, wait!

155
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,330
This is the first time
I've had you to myself all night.

156
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,760
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,910
It's those fund-raisers.

158
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,940
Everybody wants a piece
of the candidate.

159
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,140
What are you doing?

160
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,430
Taking my piece.

161
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,140
Are you insane? We're in an elevator.

162
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,451
Exactly.

163
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:17,630
Going down...

164
00:08:17,782 --> 00:08:18,880
No! Come on.

165
00:08:18,976 --> 00:08:20,040
Cut it out.

166
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,500
The power could come on at any moment.

167
00:08:22,508 --> 00:08:23,520
I know.

168
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:26,650
That's what makes
it so exciting-- the risk.

169
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,832
But, uh,  I'm kind of running
for mayor here, remember?

170
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,050
It's an elevator, silly.

171
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,180
It has an emergency stop button.

172
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,336
I don't.

173
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,868
Oh,  my God,  that's amazing!

174
00:08:46,869 --> 00:08:47,900
What are you doing?

175
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,037
That's my phone.
It's on vibrate.

176
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,044
oh, God!

177
00:08:52,217 --> 00:08:54,970
Oh, man, I was just starting
to get into it.

178
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,720
Less talking, more dressing.

179
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,670
you two okay?

180
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,980
Yeah, fine, thanks.

181
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:10,680
Must've gotten pretty hot in there.

182
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:13,940
You have no idea.

183
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,830
karen, don't worry about a thing.

184
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,840
I'll collect your mail
till you get back.

185
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,140
Well, how long's this blackout
supposed to last?

186
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,260
Well, they say it may last for days.

187
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,390
Days?!

188
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,769
Uh... hey, blondie, come here.

189
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,807
Come here.

190
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,064
Hey, listen, I don't really
need to go to the hospital.

191
00:09:39,084 --> 00:09:40,088
I'm fine.

192
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:41,580
You fractured a rib,
and you might have a concussion.

193
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,610
You need looking after.

194
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,570
No, some of the stuff
in my freezer might melt.

195
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,910
How about I just run out and get some
ice and then meet you at the hospital?

196
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,200
Ma'am, you can replace groceries.

197
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,523
You don't understand.

198
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:54,710
Some of my groceries--
they have sentimental value.

199
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:55,781
Sorry.

200
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,311
I don't need to ask your permission.

201
00:09:57,368 --> 00:09:58,430
Ma'am, no!

202
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,630
Get your hands off me, you big ape!

203
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,340
Get the restraints.

204
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,140
I'm gonna sue your ass!

205
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,520
hey!

206
00:10:15,907 --> 00:10:17,990
What are we waiting for?
Get me to the hospital.

207
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,410
I'm not a well woman.

208
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,930
What was that all about?

209
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,960
Your friend's afraid the stuff
in her freezer is gonna spoil.

210
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,140
Oh, well, thank God the power's back on.

211
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,330
Now she won't have to worry.

212
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,830
I made you waffles!

213
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,990
Eat 'em while they're hot.

214
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:04,550
What?

215
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,500
Will you marry me?

216
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,950
They're just toaster waffles.

217
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:13,685
Ah, that was just
the pre-proposal, actually.

218
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,556
The real one will be much more romantic

219
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,576
with a big diamond
the size of a doorknob.

220
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:20,720
But just so you're prepared,
I do wanna marry you.

221
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,454
Well, just so you're prepared,
consider this my pre-refusal.

222
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:24,534
Come on. What's wrong?

223
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,656
You're wearing my shirts.
You burn my breakfast.

224
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:29,048
You're here every night.
It's like wee married already.

225
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,230
We're having a good time.

226
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:31,912
Why risk ruining it?

227
00:11:31,969 --> 00:11:34,904
See, what happened to the thrill seeker
that seduced me in the elevator?

228
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:36,872
She wouldn't be afraid
of taking a little risk.

229
00:11:36,873 --> 00:11:38,210
Oh, you don't wanna marry her.

230
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,260
She's a tramp.

231
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,470
Hold out for a good girl.

232
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:43,470
I've found what I'm looking for.

233
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,090
Come on. What gives?

234
00:11:48,170 --> 00:11:49,580
Look, Victor...

235
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,310
getting divorced really kicked my ass.

236
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,710
I'm sorry. Just...

237
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:59,010
next time I get married,
I've gotta be sure.

238
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,770
Okay, I get it.

239
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,870
I just wish there was a way I could
prove how much I love and ore you.

240
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,880
Well, if you canhoke down
that lousy waffle I made you,

241
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,140
that'd be a starT.

242
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,160
oh, there's Mike.

243
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,560
Should we see if he's free friday night?

244
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,640
Yeah. Yeah, why not?

245
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,079
Sure.

246
00:12:37,232 --> 00:12:40,994
You know what? Do you wanna run
this ice cream side before it melts?

247
00:12:50,155 --> 00:12:53,050
Look, Ian is going to come
invite you to dinner friday,

248
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,770
and you are not I repeat--
not going to accept.

249
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:58,870
Why is Ian inviting me to dinner?

250
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,714
He wants to thank you for saving us,

251
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,880
and he wants to show
that he's not jealous of you.

252
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,360
How's that for irony?

253
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,210
I didn't plan to kiss you,
but you didn't exactly resist.

254
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,870
I was in shock.

255
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,893
Why were you so upset
when you mentioned Ian?

256
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:14,970
Because we had just had a fight...

257
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,153
about you.

258
00:13:17,404 --> 00:13:18,436
Really?

259
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,650
You talk about me a lot?

260
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,239
Mike, I am marrying Ian.

261
00:13:22,413 --> 00:13:23,490
We have hired a caterer.

262
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,980
We are going with the salmon,
so just back off!

263
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,290
Hey, Ian.

264
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,550
Hi, Ian.

265
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,920
I just asked Mike.

266
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:32,060
He can't make it.

267
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:33,290
Yeah, I'm sorry.

268
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,920
I've got plans tonight.

269
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,785
Oh, but didn't we say friday?

270
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,089
Friday?

271
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,370
Oh, friday I'm wide open.

272
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:41,870
Splendid!

273
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,710
Shall we say 7:30?

274
00:13:44,008 --> 00:13:45,090
It's a date.

275
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,590
Mrs. Epstein!

276
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,549
Listen, I'm late for
my hadassah meeting.

277
00:14:00,626 --> 00:14:01,660
Here's the key.

278
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,820
Take your time.

279
00:14:02,996 --> 00:14:04,300
Oh, and don't be shy.

280
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,890
Check out those closets.

281
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,760
They're very spacious.

282
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,400
Edie, what are we doing here?

283
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,760
Checking out a house.

284
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,910
I told you, I'm not looking
to buy right now.

285
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,920
Well, who's talking
about buying anything?

286
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,108
I...

287
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:20,360
am giving it away.

288
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,060
Edie, we cannot have sex in here.

289
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,428
It's someone else's bed!

290
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,460
That's just wrong!

291
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,850
Look, we can't use my place.

292
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,520
We can't use yours.

293
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,300
But I'll be damned if
I am gonna pay for a hotel room

294
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:38,220
when there are all of these empty houses
all over town that I have the keys to.

295
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:44,090
<i>Though reluctant at first, Carlos
soon saw the wisdom in Edie's plan.

296
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,820
<i>Secret affairs e a lot like real estate.

297
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,500
<i>The three keys to success are...

298
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,700
<i>location...

299
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:53,790
<i>location...

300
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,677
<i>location.

301
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,330
- Careful. I can't sit down that fast.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

302
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,810
But it's gonna be worth it.

303
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:07,795
Okay, so tell Tom
the secret of your risotto.

304
00:15:07,911 --> 00:15:11,340
Well,  I sauté spinach and
onions in white wine--

305
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,280
no, no, the profit margin.

306
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:16,030
Uh, basically, it costs
a dollar to make--

307
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,320
and we charge $20!

308
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,570
4 people who would've shared a $15
pizza are now spending 80 bucks.

309
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,570
Okay, kids, dig in!

310
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:30,150
There's just one little problem
with that, Lynette.

311
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:33,210
Those families you're talking
about have kids,

312
00:15:33,386 --> 00:15:36,400
and there's no kid that's gonna
eat anything with spinach in it.

313
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,480
It's delicious, huh?

314
00:15:47,836 --> 00:15:50,100
Rick learned how to make this in Italy.

315
00:15:50,101 --> 00:15:51,120
Go ahead.

316
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,271
Try it. I wanna see what you think.

317
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,130
It's good.

318
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,280
It's awesome!

319
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:08,550
It's good.

320
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,480
But?

321
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,742
But it's just not us.

322
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:15,997
Us?

323
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,310
What is us?

324
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,280
Look, we're a neighborhood pizza place.

325
00:16:19,338 --> 00:16:20,710
We serve pizza.

326
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,802
I like this better.

327
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:23,170
I'm getting bored of pizza.

328
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,470
Porter, the adults are talking.

329
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,100
Look, we serve good food at good prices.

330
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:31,020
We're not looking to be the next,
you know, trendy flash in the pan.

331
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,060
That's not what I'm looking for either.

332
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,156
See, my food it's not trendy.

333
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,395
It's classic.

334
00:16:38,028 --> 00:16:40,940
Obviously you're a great cook,
and when you have your own place,

335
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,150
I will definitely eat there, but
I see no reason to change my menu.

336
00:16:49,972 --> 00:16:51,246
More, please!

337
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:09,150
Hi! Can I help you?

338
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:12,860
Uh, yeah, I'm here to see mr. Lang.

339
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,910
He's not here. Is that for him?

340
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:19,610
But it's very personal.

341
00:17:20,517 --> 00:17:23,400
I don't think I should leave it
with the maid.

342
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,610
Do I look like the maid?
Give me that!

343
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:43,236
<i>Victor Lang if you want the negatives.
I demand 50,000!

344
00:17:43,352 --> 00:17:45,860
<i>Do not call the police!
I will contact you!

345
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,478
You! Blackmailer!

346
00:17:50,687 --> 00:17:53,680
Oh,  man, you weren't
supposed to look!

347
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:02,161
Get off of me!

348
00:18:04,724 --> 00:18:07,130
$50,000? Are you insane?!

349
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,598
No, that's not for you to decide!

350
00:18:08,599 --> 00:18:11,475
I want all the negatives of those
photos, or I start breaking fingers!

351
00:18:11,476 --> 00:18:12,770
No, you can't break my fingers!

352
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,870
Come on!

353
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,710
Give me the pictures!

354
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:19,690
Hey, break it up! Break it up!
Come on!Come on!

355
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,840
She's crazy! She's crazy!

356
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,430
That's for calling me a maid!

357
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,050
He works the hotel security monitors.

358
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,030
That's how he got the photos.

359
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,440
That miserable cockroach.

360
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:38,690
if you wanna smack him around a little,
I can go inside and turn up the radio.

361
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,110
Again, no, thank you,
but I will need those photos.

362
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,180
Oh, no, I'm gonna hang on to these.

363
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,850
They're a little revealing.

364
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,570
Ma'am, we can't charge him
without evidence, and if he walks,

365
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:51,190
he can do what he wants
with the originals.

366
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,550
But guard them with your life.

367
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,560
Yeah, especially that one.

368
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:07,650
We've been open for three months now,
and we've barely turned a profit!

369
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,880
we are building a customer base!
That takes time!

370
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,620
Go on, ask her.

371
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,970
No, you ask her!

372
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,417
Why are you being so stubborn?

373
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:21,200
And you would rather see the restaurant
fail than succeed with Rick's idea!

374
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,340
And I can't believe that you two
are ready to toss out my concept.

375
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:27,470
You know, why don't you just rename
the restaurant <i>"Lynette and Rick's"</i>?

376
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,770
- Can we have fudgsicles?
- No!

377
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,470
Sorry, Lynette, but the menu
is not changing. End of discussion.

378
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,480
I don't think so.

379
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,970
I'm giving it a try.

380
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,490
That's not your decision to make.

381
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:46,010
Well, then why don't you come down
to the restaurant and stop me?

382
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,020
Oh, that's right. You can't.

383
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:54,680
I told you she'd say no.

384
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:00,350
Ms. Mccluskey always
has some fudgsicles.

385
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,680
Yeah, but she's in the hospital.

386
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,300
Where's the ice cream?

387
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,440
She didn't have any.

388
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,693
oh, man!

389
00:20:54,445 --> 00:20:56,992
There wasn't anything good in there?

390
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:21,757
<i>Lang sexcapade caught on tape!

391
00:21:21,938 --> 00:21:23,397
What the hell were you thinking?

392
00:21:23,435 --> 00:21:24,487
How was I supposed to know

393
00:21:24,488 --> 00:21:26,626
the cops were gonna release
the photos to the press?

394
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:29,410
Everybody in town knows the police chief
is the mayor's brother-in-law everyone!

395
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,474
Enough, Jerome!

396
00:21:30,475 --> 00:21:31,892
I want you to organize
a press conference,

397
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:33,449
and then I want you
to help me prep for it.

398
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,345
Well, this is gonna be a bloodbath.
I don't know how you're gonna prep.

399
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:40,408
Just get me a bucket of piranhas,
and I'll stick my head in it.

400
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:49,090
you know, you're a single guy.
Maybe people won't care.

401
00:21:49,130 --> 00:21:53,140
I'm running a family values campaign,
and I had sex in an elevator.

402
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,810
I think they will care.

403
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:02,090
Look, I know this is my fault, so if
you wanna bite my head off, go ahead.

404
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:05,254
You know, Gaby, there are only two
things that matter to me these days--

405
00:22:05,255 --> 00:22:07,280
my campaign and you.

406
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,350
And if I had to lose one of them,
I'd rather it was the campaign.

407
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,310
Is there anything I can do?

408
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,510
You can stick around on election night.

409
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,530
I have a feeling I'm gonna need
some serious consoling.

410
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,560
God, that is so good!

411
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:37,070
I know. It's hard to decide, huh?

412
00:22:37,696 --> 00:22:40,800
No, I'm gonna go with the crab cakes
and the little quesadillas.

413
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,980
Well, all we need is
a wedding cake, and we're done.

414
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,550
You are the most decisive
bride I've ever met.

415
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:48,404
I just guess I'm in a rush.

416
00:22:49,948 --> 00:22:51,279
Oh, gotcha.

417
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,110
Well, don't worry.
You are not showing at all.

418
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh, no. No, I'm not pregnant.

419
00:22:57,030 --> 00:23:01,060
No, I just know what I want,
which is Ian.

420
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,677
So I'm just eager to...

421
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:06,131
you know, not get it over with,
per se,  but just to...

422
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:11,370
get to the good part,
which is the marriage... to Ian.

423
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,480
Seems like a great guy.

424
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,250
I don't suppose he has a brother.

425
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,660
Oh, so you're not seeing anyone?

426
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,340
No, I'm between disappointments.

427
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,720
Well, are you free for dinner tomorrow?

428
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,770
Is this some lame setup?

429
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,200
Please say yes.

430
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,486
Well, there's this guy coming
to dinner, and he is

431
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,104
single and handsome and charming and...

432
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,610
You had me at "<i>guy<i>".

433
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,420
So how do you know him?

434
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:45,560
Oh, uh... he's just a neighbor.

435
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,970
- Hey, buddy, whatcha doing?
- Nothing.

436
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,210
You seem a little mopey lately.
Is everything okay?

437
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,190
Can we go see mrs. Mccluskey?

438
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,060
You guys didn't have to come down here.

439
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:11,077
No matter what that CAT scan says,
I'm breaking out tomorrow.

440
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:13,130
Well, Parker really wanted
to come visit you.

441
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,560
I'm gonna put a little water in these.

442
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:20,760
Don't tell your brothers.
you were always my favorite.

443
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:24,080
I saw the man in your freezer.

444
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,150
Could you run down to the snack bar
and get me some green jell-o?

445
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:32,100
Oh, sure!

446
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:40,170
Okay, time for a little grown-up talk.

447
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:52,650
So can you understand now
why I had to do what I did?

448
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,560
And how you can never tell anyone,
not even your mom?

449
00:24:55,590 --> 00:25:00,910
Hey, they didn't have jell-o,
so I hope pudding is okay.

450
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,450
Yeah, let's give it to Parker.

451
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:06,450
A good boy like him deserves a treat.

452
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,820
what are you thinking about?

453
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:24,040
Just... this room doesn't really work.

454
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:26,020
It's just too sterile.

455
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:29,050
Can we go back to
that spanish colonial on 3rd?

456
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,672
Sure. Fine.

457
00:25:32,613 --> 00:25:34,760
You know what I was thinking?

458
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:43,640
I'm really happy, and I haven't felt
this happy in a long time.

459
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,290
How about you?

460
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,860
Are you happy?

461
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:50,570
Oh, my God!

462
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,970
Oops, sorry. Bed's not made.

463
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,520
Why don't you check out
the subzero in the kitchen?

464
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,050
It's to die.

465
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,090
Well, I see you can't close a sale
without opening something else.

466
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,530
Oh, please, I heard about
your open house on Holly drive.

467
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:11,000
They're still disinfecting the jacuzzi.

468
00:26:11,030 --> 00:26:13,039
- Slut.
- Bitch.

469
00:26:16,663 --> 00:26:18,060
you think he's gonna tell anyone?

470
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:21,930
He's a gay realtor.
He's speed-dialing as we speak.

471
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,250
Then go stop him.

472
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,620
What's the big deal?

473
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
Who cares if people find out?

474
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,560
- I do.
- Why?

475
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,390
Are you embarrassed to be dating me?

476
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,660
No! it's... you know, if Gaby finds out,
she's gonna hit the ceiling.

477
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,350
Oh, why would she care?
She's dating that Victor guy.

478
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,050
Please, that's not gonna last.

479
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,860
Oh, my God.

480
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:50,770
You're still in love with her.

481
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:56,840
No, I just... look, I mean, we've been
getting along, and don't wanna...

482
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:01,740
I don't know who the bigger
Moron is you or me.

483
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:04,680
Hey, don't be like this.

484
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,300
Look, we're having fun, right?

485
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,630
Apparently that's all we're having.

486
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,090
Edie, come on!

487
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,720
No, fun's over.

488
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:23,230
Ah, Mike. Thanks for coming.

489
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,310
Thanks for asking me.

490
00:27:33,232 --> 00:27:35,683
- hi.
- Um, Mike,

491
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:38,810
I want you to meet Maggie Gilroy.

492
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:46,690
I don't believe this.

493
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,310
You're setting me up?

494
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,240
You need to move on, okay?

495
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,860
I don't wanna move on.

496
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,090
I came here to see you.

497
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:56,190
Well, I'm not available, so if you feel
like kissing someone tonight,

498
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,900
point those lips at Maggie.

499
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:03,330
Here we go your beer.

500
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,779
Did I mention that Maggie
is an amazing chef?

501
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,410
We're embarrassed to be cooking for her.

502
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,540
Stop.

503
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,880
So, Mike, do you have
a favorite type of cuisine?

504
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:22,640
Nah. After 3 months of prison food,
everything tastes good to me.

505
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,070
So you were in prison?

506
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,590
He was totally innocent.

507
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:32,810
Yeah, a woman was bludgeoned to death,
and her blood wound up on my wrench.

508
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:34,200
Oh, my God.

509
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,720
But he was cleared. All charges dropped.

510
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,760
Here. Eat this.

511
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,170
It's just so awful.

512
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,020
I mean,  to go to jail for
a crime you didn't commit.

513
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:44,440
Oh, it was just a few months.

514
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,170
Now my first stretch for manslaughter...

515
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,480
that was brutal.

516
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,630
My worst cellmate was
this guy called "<i>stilts</i>".

517
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:59,860
When they arrested him,
they found a bowl full of ears.

518
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:03,650
I think that was meant for you.

519
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:04,842
Sorry.

520
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,190
So why don't I just go and
brew some coffee?

521
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:13,550
And I brought a little surprise for
dessert wedding cakes for you to sample.

522
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,940
Great.

523
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:23,720
Thanks a lot. Now Maggie thinks
you're Charles Manson.

524
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,660
I don't care. I love you.

525
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,820
Don't say that.

526
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,250
It's true. I remember everything now.

527
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,280
When I got run over, I was on
my way to propose to you.

528
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,830
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- I do.

529
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,320
What would you have said?

530
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,230
You know what I would have said.
It doesn't matter now.

531
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,870
The hell it doesn't Susan,

532
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,020
if you can look me in the eye and
tell me that when we kissed,

533
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,720
you felt nothing,  then I'll just go,

534
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:53,070
but only if you can say that
and really mean it.

535
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,186
Can you?

536
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,590
Who wants wedding cake?

537
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,840
Maggie, these cakes are fantastic.

538
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:09,390
Great. Well, all you have to do is
choose one, and we're done.

539
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,000
Did you notice the themes?

540
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,730
Themes? Yes.

541
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:17,560
This one is very british
fondant icing and toffee ganache.

542
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,670
And this is your classic american
white cake with buttercream frosting.

543
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,410
So which one do you like the best?

544
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,420
Wow. It's kinda hard to decide.

545
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:37,610
Well, that depends on what
you're looking for rich and elegant...

546
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:41,910
or down-to-earth and sweet?

547
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,770
I don't know.

548
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,340
You want to taste 'em again?

549
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,390
No, I know what they taste like.

550
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,960
I'm just torn, okay?

551
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,320
There's no need to get upset.
It's just a cake.

552
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,940
It's not just a cake.
It's a major decision!

553
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,700
Well, if you like 'em both so much,
why don't you have two cakes?

554
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,740
How would that look?

555
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:04,330
"Oh, hey, everybody!"

556
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,060
"Here's my wedding cake."

557
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,680
"Oh, and what's that over there?"

558
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:09,600
"It's my other wedding cake."

559
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:12,330
I have to pick, and I will!

560
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,280
So just stop pressuring me, okay?

561
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,328
I'm sorry.

562
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,748
I think I was just having
a little sugar rush.

563
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:36,740
Thanks again, and sorry.

564
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:54,050
seriously, just put it on hold
for just a month or two.

565
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,740
Excuse me.
Am I interrupting something?

566
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,950
No. It's nothing.

567
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,660
I think it's time to level with him.

568
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:06,030
I just told Susan I want her back.

569
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,530
Excuse me?

570
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,206
Look, I know it puts a crimp in your
plans, and I'm sorry, but I love her.

571
00:32:12,225 --> 00:32:14,960
Well, that's too damn bad, isn't it?
Because she doesn't love you.

572
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,600
Really?

573
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,660
She didn't seem to mind
when I kissed her.

574
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,120
What? Did he just kiss you?

575
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,860
No. It was days ago.

576
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,960
- And you let him?!
- No! He pounced.

577
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,260
It was hardly a pounce.

578
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,470
You bastard.
We... we had an agreement.

579
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,700
Susan doesn't have to sorry you
because you won her in a game of cards.

580
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,430
What, he didn't tell you how
we played poker for you?

581
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,910
You bet me in a game of poker?

582
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,090
It's not how it sounds.

583
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,530
I merely suggested that if I won the
hand, then he would stop badgering you.

584
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,160
And if he won?

585
00:32:51,210 --> 00:32:55,090
I forget the exact terms, but the
point is, he lost, as I knew he would.

586
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:59,070
I never would have wagered you if
I didn't have a very good hand.

587
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,190
- Get out!
- Susan, please.

588
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,956
- You heard her.
- You, too.

589
00:33:04,995 --> 00:33:06,310
I've had it with both of you.

590
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,980
You're tugging at me like
I'm some kind of wishbone.

591
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:12,250
- You're just upset.
- No, I am beyond upset.

592
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,690
You two want a decision?
Well, here's what I decide.

593
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:17,633
There will be no kissing,
and there will be no wedding,

594
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:20,720
and there will be no damn cake!

595
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,560
what's this?

596
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,170
Uh, pumpkin sage ravioli.

597
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,390
It's a little thank you
for taking a chance on me.

598
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,960
Are you kidding?
I should be thanking you.

599
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:47,800
We took in 3 grand tight.

600
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,960
Oh, woW. Candles, too?

601
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,200
Yeah, I think we should
use 'em all the time.

602
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,340
It softens up the ambience.

603
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,050
So come on. Eat.

604
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,480
Oh, my God.

605
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:15,510
If we serve this for tomorrow's special,
will clear 4 grand.

606
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:19,260
Great. just be sure
to run it by Tom.

607
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,140
Why? You know
he'll just shoot it down.

608
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,850
I mean, I get it. He's in pain.

609
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,800
He doesn't like being sidelined,
but that is no reason to...

610
00:34:30,075 --> 00:34:32,090
you know what?
Let's talk about something else.

611
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,370
Yeah, sure.

612
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:37,530
I mean, unless you'd like to go.
You're here so late all the time.

613
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,380
No, I like being here.

614
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,425
It beats going home
to an empty apartment.

615
00:34:41,502 --> 00:34:43,360
Don't you have any friends
to hang out with?

616
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:47,117
My friends come in two varieties
the ones I drove away bere I got clean

617
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:50,455
and the ones I should avoid
if I wanna stay clean.

618
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:53,305
Yeah. I gotcha.

619
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,920
you ever wear your hair down?

620
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:05,250
What? Yeah, sometimes. why?

621
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:07,840
It looks really good.

622
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:11,320
You should do it more often.

623
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:15,370
Oh, well... thanks.

624
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:29,040
- This is delicious.
- Thanks.

625
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:32,170
- Do you want some more wine?
- Sure.

626
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:40,894

about your restaurant.

You're kidding!

629
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:49,250
Well, come here.
What does it say?

630
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:55,550
"When scavo's pizzeria opened its doors,
you could almost hear the city groan,"

631
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,490
"just what we need
another pizza joint."

632
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,975
"But with an updated menu
from new chef Rick Coletti..."

633
00:36:02,149 --> 00:36:04,250
Is he the man who cooked
us that really, really...

634
00:36:04,270 --> 00:36:06,490
Yeah, that's the one.

635
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,910
What else does it say, honey?

636
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,300
"There's more than just
crayons on the table."

637
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:14,960
"The veal piccata is divine,
and the mushroom risotto is an..."

638
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,540
- "e-x-q-u--"
- Exquisite.

639
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,020
"An exquisite treat."

640
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:23,522
"Scavo's has been transformed
from a mundane family eatery"

641
00:36:23,715 --> 00:36:26,262
"into the area's hottest--"

642

Mr. Lang, given your 15-point
drop in the polls,

649
00:37:10,186 --> 00:37:12,405
what do you have to say
to your constituents?

650

Well, I would ask them to not base
their view of me on a single lapse of...

It's not going very well, is it?

652
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,260
You picked up on that, did you?

653
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,770
Who is she, mr. Lang?
Give us a name.

654
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,680
No, I will not identify the woman.

655
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,510
What are you hiding?
Is she a prostitute?

656
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,780
no! She's not a prostitute.

657
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:35,420

658

That does it.

659
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,302
Whoa. What are you doing?

660
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:45,600
Gaby, stop, please.Please, stop.

661
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,260
Excuse me. Excuse me.

662
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:55,550
Excuse me.
I am the woman in the photos!

663
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:04,000

664
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,260
Standing by my man.

665
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,460
what's your name?

666
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:13,610
My name is Gabrielle Marquez,
and I want you to know,

667
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,710
right before those photos were taken,
Victor asked me to marry him.

668
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,400
what did you say?

669
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:24,800
I said, "<i>yes</i>".

670
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:29,010
I would be thrilled
to be mrs. Victor Lang.

671
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,120
Are you gonna get married?

672
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,450
Have you set a date?

673

Are you really getting married?

674
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:38,790
In fact, I was so overcome, that
when we were trapped in the elevator,

675
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:41,700
I seized the moment to...

676
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,830
express my joy.

677
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,790
So this is a love story?

678
00:38:45,830 --> 00:38:49,810
The only reason Victor kept it
from you was to protect me...

679
00:38:49,830 --> 00:38:54,320
because he's the kind of man who
puts a woman's honor before his own,

680
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:57,060
and that's the kind of man you marry.

681
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,150
That's the kind of man you vote for.

682
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,190

00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,600

00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,910
and there might be another
rolling blackout today.

696
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,590
Do you want me to leave Ida's number
in case something happens?

697
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,290
I'm sure I'll be fine.

698
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,840
Did you read our review in the paper?

699
00:40:58,268 --> 00:40:59,329
I'm off.

700
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:28,560
<i>Power... it's the type of thing
most people don't think about...

701
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,998
<i>until it's taken away.

702
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:37,590
<i>Whether it's the political
power of the many...

703
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,840
<i>or a lover's influence over just one...

704
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:52,990
<i>we all want some sort
of power in our lives...

705
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:57,330
<i>if only to give ourselves choices.

706
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:07,277
<i>Yes,  to be without choices,
to feel utterly powerless,  well...

707
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,350
<i>it's a lot...

708
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,334
<i>like being alone... in the dark.

709
00:42:14,662 --> 00:42:16,977
