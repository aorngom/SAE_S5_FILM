00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,610
I THINK I HAVE <i>YOUR</i> SUITCASE.

164
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,640
YEAH,AND I THINK I HAVE YOURS.

165
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,080
SO,DID YOU,UM,
DID YOU HAPPEN TO SEE THE,UM--

166
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,670
YEAH.

167
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,020
-AND DID YOU NOTICE...  -HARD TO MISS.

168
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:43,980
-WELL,I'M JUST GOING TO,UM...  
-HIDE PATHETICALLY IN YOUR ROOM?

169
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,840
ME,TO

170
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,680
HEY,LYNETTE.

171
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,560
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

172
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,560
KAYLA CALLED,
AND SHE TOLD ME ABOUT TOM'S BACK.

173
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,900
AND MY CAR GOT IMPOUNDED AGAIN,

174
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:03,240
SO I THOUGHT THAT I'D HITCH 
A RIDE WITH YOU.

175
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,720
HITCH?

176
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:08,250
YOU MEAN,LIKE,WE'RE GONNA BE 
DRIVING IN THE CAR TOGETHER?

177
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,390
WELL,YOU COULD STRAP ME TO THE FRONT BUMPER,

178
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:13,820
BUT,UH,YEAH,I'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE INSIDE.

179
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,690
UH,IT'S LIKE AN 8-HOUR DRIVE.

180
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,100
SO?

181
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,960
UM,HOW FAR IS THE IMPOUND LOT?

182
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,120
BECAUSE,YOU KNOW,I COULD JUST 
DRIVE YOU OVER THERE AND--

183
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,500
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,LYNETTE?

184
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,440
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM. I JUST 
DON'T THINK WE BOTH NEED TO GO UP THERE.

185
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,370
I CAN GRAB KAYLA AND BRING HER BACK.

186
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,040
OH,I SEE YOUR PLAN--

187
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,740
YOU JUST WANNA GO CHARGING UP 
THERE ON YOUR WHITE HORSE

188
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:39,310
AND SAVE EVERYONE,AND THEN I GET TO BE

189
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,470
THE ROTTEN MOTHER WHO DIDN'T GIVE A RAT'S ASS 
AND STAYED HOME EATING BONBONS.

190
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,880
NO.

191
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:55,020
<i>-DUE TO LYNETTE'S SUDDEN DEPARTURE...</i> 
-THANK YOU.

192
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,890
<i>GABRIELLE WAS FORCED</i> 
<i>TO SPEND THE LAST NIGHT OF HER SPA VACATION ALONE,</i>

193
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,230
<i>BUT SHE DIDN'T MIND.</i>

194
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:08,540
<i>IN FACT,SHE LOOKED FORWARD</i> 
<i>TO A QUIET DINNER ALONEWITH HER THOUGHTS.</i>

195
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,640
<i>UNFORTUNATELY FOR GAIELLE,</i>

196
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:15,130
<i>HER THOUGHTS QUICKLY TURNED</i>  
<i>TO HER IMPENDING DIVORCE</i>

197
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,170
<i>AND THE EMPTY HOUSE</i>  
<i>SHE'D SOON RETURN TO,</i>

198
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:24,030
<i>AND SHE BEGAN TO RESENT</i>  
<i>THE HAPPY COUPLES SHE WAS SEEING...</i>

199
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,500
<i>EVERYWHERE.</i>

200
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,290
WHAT IS THIS,FREAKIN' NOAH'S ARK?!

201
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,650
I GUESS IT REALLY <i>IS</i> A SMALL WORLD.

202
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:36,750
WHO'S THERE? I CAN'T SEE YOU.

203
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,680
CAN YOU SEE ME NOW?

204
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,080
HOW MUCH,BABY?

205
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,680
EXCUSE ME,MA'AM?

206
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:59,430
I MEAN... MISS,

207
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,880
I'M LOOKING FOR SOMEONE. 
UH,HIS NAME IS ANDREW.

208
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,080
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

209
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,910
HARD TO SAY,BOO. 
I SEE A LOT OF LOST BOYS HIS AGE.

210
00:12:05,910 --> 00:12:08,880
GOOD-LOOKING ONE,THOUGH. 
SOMEONE SPECIAL?

211
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,500
YES,VERY,AND I'M WORRIED SICK ABOIM.

212
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,290
YOU MIGHT TRY THE SOUP KITCHEN AT ST.
 MALACHI'S ON THIRD.

213
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:17,720
-OH,THANK YOU,MISS...  
-GATES. PEARLY GATES--

214
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,650
'CAUSE YOU CAN'T GET TO HEAVEN 
WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ME.

215
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,050
HOW VERY SAUCY.

216
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,990
GREAT PIANO. DO YOU PLAY?

217
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,890
OH,NO,I'M A-- I'M A BIT RUSTY.

218
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:38,050
JANE LOVED TO SING,SO I'D PLAY FOR HER,
BUT SINCE THE ACCIDENT...

219
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,620
RIGHT.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,460
SO...

221
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:50,440
BRANDY,

222
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,220
A ROARING FIRE--

223
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,130
WHAT COULD BE MORE ROMANTIC?

224
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:56,690
WELL,I CAN THINK OF-- OF SOMETHING.

225
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:01,090
WOW,MY HEART IS POUNDING.

226
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,620
UH,IS THAT A BAD THING? 
CONSIDER THE ALTERNATIVE.

227
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,240
YOUR HEART IS BEATING 
EVEN FASTER THAN MINE.

228
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,400
I GUESS I'M EXCITED. 
IT HAS BEEN A WHILE.

229
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:12,570
ME,TOO.

230
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,310
SO WAS THAT,UH,OKAY?

231
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,700
IT WAS BLOODY FANTASTIC.

232
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,060
OF COURSE,IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT 
THAN WHAT I'M USED TO.

233
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,270
DIFFERENT?

234
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:34,540
WELL,I-I WAS WITH THE SAME 
WOMAN FOR A LONG TIME.

235
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,210
OH,YEAH.

236
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,710
BUT,I MEAN,YOU KISSED OTHER
 GIRLS BEFORE THAT,RIGHT?

237
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,470
SURE,BUT MO OF THEM WERE 12.

238
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:43,040
AS WAS I.

239
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,630
I MENE AT A SCHOOL DANCE,
AND AFTER WE STARTED DATING,

240
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,930
WELL,I--WELL,I NEVER LOOKED AT ANYONE ELSE.

241
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,720
ARE YOU SAYING THAT JANE IS 
THE ONLY WOMAN YOU EVER...

242
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,920
OH,GOD,I <i>SO</i> DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU THAT.

243
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,320
WHY NOT? I THINK THAT'S ADORABLE.

244
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,190
WELL,I DON'T WANT TO BE ADORABLE. 
I WANT TO BE DASHING AND WORLDLY AND...

245
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:04,830
OH,IAN. IT'S OKAY.

246
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:09,220
SOME PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF LOVERS,
AND SOME JUST A FEW.

247
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,950
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

248
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,960
WELL,SEE--SEEING AS IT DOESN'T MATTER,
WHERE--WHERE DO YOU FALL ON THAT SPECTRUM?

249
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:20,920
YOU KNOW,HOW--HOW MANY MEN HAVE YOU BEEN WITH?

250
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,420
-IAN.  
-OH,I'M SORRY. THAT--THAT WAS RUDE.

251
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,100
I WITHDRAW THE QUESTION.

252
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,440
IT'S NOT THAT IT'S RUDE. 
IT'S JUST IMMATERIAL.

253
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,270
I MEAN,IT'S JUST A NUMBER. 
IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

254
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:32,620
-SEEING AS IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING--  
-IAN!

255
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,600
WELL,YOU KNOW MY NUMBER. IT'S ONLY FAIR.

256
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,330
IS IT-- IS IT MORE THAN THREE?

257
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,600
NINE.

258
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,900
PLEASE TELL ME YOU WERE ANSWERING IN GERMAN.

259
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:45,800
NINE LOVERS IS NOT A LOT! NINE 
LOVERS DOES NOT MAKE ME A SLUT!

260
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,990
WHY ARE YOU GETTING UPSET?

261
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:50,330
BECAUSE IT WAS REALLY 11,AND I KNOCKED
 OFF TWO,AND YOU'RE STILL JUDGING ME.

262
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:53,690
I'M NOT JUDGING YOU. IT'S JUST... 
DID YOU WORK IN THE RECORDING INDUSTRY?

263
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:54,990
OKAY,JUST SO YOU KNOW,

264
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,530
11 IS NOT A LOT FOR A WOMAN MY AGE.

265
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,920
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

266
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,100
WHAT IS THIS,THE GALLUP POLL?!

267
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,190
-WHERE--WHERE YOU GOING?  -TO BED,<i>ALONE.</i>

268
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,910
YOU KNOW,IT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED 
TO TRY,BUT I'VE JUST NEVER GOTTEN AROUND TO.

269
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:12,960
SO THEY LIKED THE LANDSCAPING 
I DID HERE SO MUCH

270
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,410
THAT THEY HIRED MY COMPANY 
TO DO WHOLE SINCLAIR HOTEL CHAIN.

271
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,760
YOUR COMPANY? YOU HAVE A COMPANY NOW?

272
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,050
OH,MY GOSH,WHEN I MET YOU,
ALL YOU HAD WAS A BIKE.

273
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,080
WELL,NOT ONLY THAT,

274
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,110
THE,UH,GARDENING CHANNEL'S APPROACHED 
ME ABOUT HOSTING MY OWN SHOW.

275
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,410
I MEAN,WE'RE STILL 
IN THE TALKING STAGES,BUT...

276
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,850
WHAT?

277
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,440
NOTHING. I JUS..

278
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,730
I CAN'T GET OVER HOWATURE 
AND CONFIDENT YOU ARE.

279
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:40,750
YOU'VE REALLY CHANGED.

280
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:44,450
THANKS. I WAS HOPING YOU'D NOTICE.

281
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:47,760
SO I GUESS,UH,THERE'S NO CHANCE 
OF GETTING YOU OVER TO THE HOUSE

282
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,010
TO PICK THE DEAD LEAVES OFF MY FICUS.

283
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,010
YEAH,YOU KNOW,I'M--I'M KIND OF PAST THAT.

284
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:58,890
BESIDES,I DON'T THINK MR. 
SOLIS WOULD APPROVE.

285
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:01,530
ACTUALLY,WE'RE GETTING A DIVORCE.

286
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,910
UM,I'M--I'M REALLY SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

287
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,490
REALLY? THEN WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

288
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:11,510
I DON'T KNOW. WHY ARE YOU?

289
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,830
GABRIELLE...

290
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,620
IT'S REALLY GREAT TO SEE YOU.

291
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,880
GABRIELLE.

292
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,280
I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST TIME 
YOU'VE EVER CALLED ME THAT.

293
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:28,030
WELL,UM...

294
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,470
I HOPE YOU ENJOY THE REST OF YOUR STAY.

295
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,240
I INTEND TO.

296
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,510
YOUR CUPPY THING IS FULL.

297
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,870
DO YOU MIND IF I PUT THIS 
IN YOUR GLOVE COMPARTMENT?

298
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:57,060
YEAH,I DO MIND. I MIND DEEPLY.

299
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,000
JEEZ-A-MAROONI. 
I'LL JUST GERID OF 'EM.

300
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,210
OH,THAT'S...  DELIGHTFUL. 
THAT'S DELIGHTFUL.

301
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:10,270
MAYBE IT'LL JUST SOAK UP 
THE CREAM SODA YOU SPILLED.

302
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,240
WHY DO YOU  <i>ALWAYS</i> PICK ON ME?

303
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,170
IT'S LIKE YOUR NEW FAVORITE GAME IS
 "FINDING FAULT WITH NORA."

304
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,340
NO,MY FAVORITE GAME

305
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:22,540
IS COUNTING ALL THE THINGS 
I'M <i>DYING</i> TO SAY TO YOU,

306
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,650
BUT I DON'T.

307
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,840
LIKE...

308
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,490
"PIPE DOWN,YOU ANNOYING NUT JOB."

309
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,570
I'D NEVER SAY THAT.

310
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,000
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY.

311
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,960
NO!

312
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,340
YOU'RE COLORFUL--

313
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,640
COLORFUL IN A WAY THAT MIGHT 
RESPOND TO MEDICATION.

314
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,410
WELL,YOU KNOW...

315
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:44,080
THERE'S LEVELS OF CRAZY,LYNETTE.

316
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,400
I MEAN,THERE ARE PEOPLE LIKE ME 
WHO JUST HAVE A BIG PERSONALITY.

317
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,850
THEN THERE ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE 
WHO DO THINGS LIKE THIS.

318
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:55,430
-AAH! OH,MY GOD!KNOCK IT OFF! 
-WHAT IS THE TTER WITH YOU?!

319
00:17:55,430 --> 00:17:58,180
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHAT THE HELL 
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

320
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:01,570
OH,LIGHTEN UP. COME ON,IT WAS A JOKE.

321
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,960
NO,WELL,IT WASN'T FUNNY. 
IF YOU WANNA KILL YOURSELF,FINE,

322
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,430
-BUT DON'T TAKE ME WITH YOU.  
-OOH,YOU'D LIKE THAT,WOULDN'T YA?

323
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:10,520
YOU'D REALLY LIKE THAT,
IF I KILLED MYSELF.

324
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:14,410
THAT IS NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

325
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:18,180
BUT IF YOU DID,
I'D FIND A WAY TOARRY ON.

326
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,300
PULL OVER.

327
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,110
-OH,LIGHTEN UP. IT'S A JOKE. 
-PULL THE CAR OVER.

328
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:30,490
-NAH.  -PULL IT OVER!

329
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,010
-PULL OVER,OR I WILL JUMP OUT OF THIS CAR.  
-ALL RIGHT,ALL RIGHT,ALL RIGHT,ALL RIGHT.

330
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:37,110
I'M PULLING OVER! JEEZ! 
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

331
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,720
HITCHING MY WAY...

332
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,440
TO THE CAMPSITE!

333
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:43,720
NORA!

334
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,670
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!

335
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:47,540
SHUT UP! JUST GET OUT OF MY FACE!

336
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,720
I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU!

337
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,170
ALL RIGHT,NOW LOOK,YOU'VE GONE
 FROM CRAZY TO STUPID.

338
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,710
THIS GUY COULD BE DANGEROUS.

339
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,710
WELL,THEN,IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY,
HUH,LYNETTE?

340
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,230
SHUT UP!

341
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:02,180
SEE?

342
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,320
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO. 
YOU JUST MANIPULATE.

343
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,590
YOU WORMED YOUR WAY INTO MY FAMILY.

344
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,650
YOU CONNED YOUR WAY INTO COMING 
ON THIS TRIP WITH ME,

345
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,860
AND NOW YOU WANNA FORCE ME INTO SAVING YOU.

346
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,780
WELL,FORGET IT! YOU WANNA GO,<i>GO.</i>

347
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,680
NO,I'VE TRIED THAT. 
IT WASN'T ENOUGH POWER.

348
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,070
YEAH,I'M WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

349
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,360
ALL RIGHT,HERE IT GOES.

350
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,370
AH,IT WORKED! I'M A GENIUS.

351
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,630
OH,HI. UM,I'M LOOKING FOR EDIE.

352
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:04,850
SHE'S OUT.

353
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,460
-UGH,GOD,WHERE IS EVERYONE TONIGHT? 
-ANYTHING I CAN DO?

354
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,320
NO,NOT UNLESS YOU CAN FIX A FUSE BOX.

355
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,400
MY SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT BLEW THE POWER OUT.

356
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,150
OH,WHAT'S YOUR PROJECT?

357
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,610
OH,UH,IT'S COMPLICATED.

358
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:20,620
YOU THINK I'M TOO DUMB TO 
UNDERSTAND YOUR LITTLE SCIENCE PROJECT?

359
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,300
IT'S NOT LITTLE. 
I FINISHED THIRD IN THE STATE TWICE.

360
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,450
NOW CAN YOU FIX THE FUSE BOX OR NOT?

361
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:29,270
MOST HOUSES BUILT AFTER 1990 ARE 
WIRED THROUGH A CIRCUIT BREAKER.

362
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,930
YOU DIDN'T BLOW A FUSE. YOU TRIPPED A BREAKER.

363
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,590
NOT TO CHALLENGE A 2-TIME STATE SCIENCE 
FAIR ALMOST-CHAMPION OR ANYTHING.

364
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:39,840
LET ME GRA A FLASHLIGHT.

365
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,930
MAYBE YOU COULD ALSO GRAB A SHIRT... 
AND SOME PANTS.

366
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,450
PANTS WOULD BE NICE.

367
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,520
SUSAN,CAN I COME IN?

368
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,550
I'M WITH A CLIENT. TAKE A NUMBER.

369
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,300
SUSAN,PLEASE.

370
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,310
EVERYTHING I SAID

371
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,840
CAME OUT OF MY-- 
MY OWN INSECURITY AND FEAR

372
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,290
THAT I--THAT I MIGHT... 
WELL,I MIGHT DISAPPOINT YOU.

373
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,470
I WAS GONNA STAY MAD
 AT YOU ANOTHER HOUR,

374
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:11,580
BUT YO DAMN ACCENT GETS ME EVERY TIME.

375
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,660
BLIMEY,YOU--YOU DON'T SAY?

376
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:16,000
DON'T PUSH IT.

377
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,740
OH,NO,I-I DON'T MEAN TO BREAK THE FLOW,
BUT I-I JUST,UM...

378
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:45,860
LOOK,I KNOW THAT I'M ONLY 
YOUR SECOND LOVER EVER,

379
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:48,010
AND THAT--I-I KNOW THAT MEANS A LOT,

380
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,270
AND I JUST DON'T WANT IT 
TO MEAN... TOO MUCH.

381
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,490
I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU. 
WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO MEAN?

382
00:21:53,490 --> 00:21:56,810
I MEAN,THE LAST TIME YOU DID THIS,
IT TURNED INTO A LIFETIME COMMITMENT,

383
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,690
AND I--I'M JUST-- I'M NOT READY FOR THAT.

384
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,510
YOU THINK I AM?

385
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:04,840
WELL,I ASSURE YOU,I'M AS CAPABLE 
OF HAVING MEANINGLESS SEX AS YOU ARE.

386
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,860
I HAVE NEVER HAD MEANINGLESS SEX.

387
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,740
SO YOU WERE--YOU WERE PASSIONATELY IN LOVE

388
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,850
AND DEEPLY COMMITTED TO ALL 11 
OF YOUR CONQUESTS?

389
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:17,640
DON'T JUDGE ME,MR. VIRGIN... PLUS ONE!

390
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,120
OKAY,OKAY,WE--WE SEEM TO HAVE GOTTEN 
OFF ON THE WRONG FOOT AGAIN.

391
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:22,390
SUSAN...

392
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:26,560
CHEERIO? BOB'S YOUR UNCLE?

393
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:29,300
GET OUT.

394
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,640
-CAN'T WE AT LEAST TALK?  -WHY?

395
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,440
YOU KNOW,EVERY TIME WE DO,
WE JUST GET ANGRY.

396
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,020
WELL,WE'RE STILL GETTING 
TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

397
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:38,080
AND THAT'S GOOD. YOU--YOU'VE LEARNED 
I'M A TAD INSECURE,

398
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
AND I'VE LEARN--WELL,YOU'RE JUST 
A WEE BIT TOUCHY.

399
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,130
OKAY,IAN,YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS--
THIIS NOT HAPPENING.

400
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,370
I AM JUST ING EP,

401
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,140
AND YOU CAN JUST DRIVE ME HOME 
IN THE MORNING.

402
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:59,620
UH,EXCUSE ME. I'M LOOKING FOR MY SON.
 HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

403
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,830
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

404
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:07,360
EXCUSE ME,YOUNG MAN. 
HAVE YOU SEEN THIS BOY?

405
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,140
ANDREW! OH,MY GOD,THANK GOD!

406
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,410
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HER

407
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:15,690
LOOKING FOR YOU. HOW DID YOU 
GET THAT BRUISE?

408
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,310
-IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. 
 -ANDREW,PLEASE!

409
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,280
SHOULDN'YOU BE AT HOME,
TAKING CARE OF YOUR NEW HUSBAND?

410
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,510
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT THAT--

411
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:25,370
I READ IT IN THE PAPER-- YOU KNOW,
THE ONE I SLEEP UNDER.

412
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:28,100
ANDREW,YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT 
TO BE ANGRY WITH ME,

413
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,820
BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW SORRY I AM--

414
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:32,920
IF YOU CAME HERE SUCKING AFTER FORGIVENESS,
YOU CAME TO THE WRONG PLACE.

415
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,180
ANDREW,PLEASE,
CAN'T WE JUST TALK ABOUT THIS?

416
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:37,390
I'M YOUR MOTHER,FOR GOD SAKES! 
YOU'RE MY SON.

417
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:40,750
NO,<i>YOU</i> DUMPED YOUR SON 
AT A GAS STATION SEVEN MONTHS AGO.

418
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:43,000
I'M SOMEBODY ELSE NOW.

419
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,750
ANDREW.

420
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,810
ANDREW!

421
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:51,470
ANDREW,PLEASE!

422
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,720
ANDREW!

423
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,510
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR RIDE?

424
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,270
THE GUY GRABBED MY BOOB,

425
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:18,520
SO I HIT HIM OVER THE HEAD 
WITH HIS BONG,AND I GOT OUT.

426
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,650
LOOK,I'M SORRY I FREAKED OUT THERE BEFORE.

427
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:29,150
IT'S JUST,WHEN YOU MADE THAT CRACK ABOUT SUICIDE,
IT JUST... KIND OF HIT HOME.

428
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,570
OH,MY GOD,NORA.

429
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:35,040
DID YOU ACTUALLY...

430
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,360
WELL,I'M... I'M VERY SORRY. I HAD NO IDEA.

431
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,160
BUT YOUR LIFE IS BETTER NOW,RIGHT?

432
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:51,530
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER,
AND YOU HAVE THAT FUN JOB AT THE...

433
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,980
PANCAKE HOUSE.

434
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,020
OH,YEAH,MY LIFE'S BETTER.

435
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,160
YEAH.

436
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:01,340
BUT IT'S NOT <i>YOUR</i> LIFE. 
YOUR LIFE'S <i>PERFECT.</i>

437
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:06,200
EXCUSE ME? DID YOU SMOKE THAT BONG 
BEFORE YOU BEAT THE GUY WITH IT?

438
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:09,750
IT'S JUST,YOU HAVE IT ALL. 
YOU HAVE THE KIDS. YOU HAVE THE CAREER.

439
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:12,390
YOU HAVE A HUSBAND.

440
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,690
YOU'RE SUPERMOM.

441
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:16,200
AND YOU THINK THAT'S EASY? OKAY,
I HAVE A GOOD LIFE.

442
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,500
YES,YES,I AM <i>VERY</i> LUCKY,
BUT I WORK 12 HOURS A DAY,

443
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,770
AND THEN I COME HOME 
TO WHAT SEEMS LIKE 33 CHILDREN

444
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:25,430
AND HUSBAN WHO RESES TO GET A J.

445
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:29,740
AND BELIEVE ME,THERE IS NOT A SUPERMOM 
OUT THERE WHO WOULDN'T TRADE IN HER CAPE

446
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,070
FOR A CHANCE TO READ A BOOK 
AND GET A MASSAGE

447
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,520
BY A MAN WHO HAS THE DECENCY 
TO LEAVE WHEN IT'S OVER.

448
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,920
OKAY,SORRY I BROUGHT IT UP.

449
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,530
I'M SORRY I SAID THAT ABOUT TOM. 
HE'S DOING HIS BEST TO FIND A JOB.

450
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:48,340
WELL,YOU KNOW,MAYBE HE'D TRY A LITTLE HARDER 
IF HE DIDN'T HATE ADVERTISING SO MUCH.

451
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,780
HE DOESN'T HATE ADVERTISING.

452
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:53,200
LAST WEEK,WHEN HE CAME 
TO PICK UP KAYLA,

453
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,160
AND HE'D JUST COME 
FROM SOME CRAPPY INTERVIEW,

454
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,060
HE SAID THAT HE'D HATED THE AD GAME FOR,
LIKE,FREAKIN' EVER

455
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,310
AND WOULD LIKE TO BAG THE WHOLE THING.

456
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,630
HE SAID THAT TO YOU?

457
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,370
HE'S NEVER TOLD ME THAT.

458
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,810
HE'S PROBABLY AFRAID TO.

459
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,350
WHY WOULD HE BE AFRAID?

460
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,050
PROBABLY BECAUSE YOU'RE THE KIND 
OF WOMAN WHO,

461
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:19,140
WHEN SOMEONE SAYS THEY WANNA KILL THEMSELVES,

462
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,300
YOU SAY,"GO AHEAD."

463
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:30,860
-YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO COME IN? 
-NO,I'M GOOD.

464
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,240
UH,YOU REALLY SHOULD SEE WHAT I'M DOING,

465
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,630
YOU KNOW,FOR NEXT TIME.

466
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,030
OKAY,HERE'S THE TRIPPED SWITCH.

467
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:50,550
SO FIRST,YOU MOVE IT TO "OFF"...  
TO RESET,THEN YOU PRE IT...TO "ON."

468
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,280
-THAT'S IT?  -YEAH.

469
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,840
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO COME ALL THE 
WAY OVER HERE TO DO THAT.

470
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,930
YOU COULD'VE JUST EXPLAINED IT TO ME.

471
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,430
YEAH,I GUESS I COULD'VE.

472
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:04,180
WELL... HELLO THERE.

473
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,910
EDIE! HI.

474
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:06,940
OH,SORRY.

475
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,300
UH,HE WAS JUST-- HE WAS HELPING
 ME GET THE LIGHTS BACK ON.

476
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,620
I-I OVERLOADED MY CIRCUITS.

477
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,600
I CAN SEE THAT.

478
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,060
YEAH,SO SHE'S DOING 
SOME BIG SCIENCE PROJECT,

479
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:19,080
AND SHE NEEDED <i>ME</i> 
TO EXPLAIN HOW ELECTRICITY WORKS.

480
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,310
I THINK THAT'S CALLED "IRONY."

481
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:23,400
JULIE,WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

482
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,550
SHE'S ON A TRIP. 
DO YOU NEED SOMETHING?

483
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:30,030
YEAH,BACK WHEN I COULD STAND HER,
I LOANED HER MY CD PLAYER. I NEED IT.

484
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:32,390
OH,SHE TOOK IT TO THE HOSPITAL FOR MIKE.

485
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,900
OH,GOD.

486
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,890
THIS FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE 
ACT IS REALLY CHAPPING MY ASS.

487
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,510
HEY,SCIENCE GUY,
I HAVE AN EXPERIMENT FOR YOU.

488
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,930
GO HOME,

489
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,660
MIX OUNCES OF GIN,
A SPLASH OF VERMOUTH,

490
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,840
AND SEE IF IT IMPROVES 
MY MOOD WHEN I DRINK IT.

491
00:27:52,650 --> 00:27:56,590
JULIE,SWEETIE... 
YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL.

492
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:59,060
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR 
AND STAY AWAY FROM MY NEPHEW.

493
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:04,440
OH! TRUST ME,I HAVE NO INTEREST 
IN SWAGGERING,MUSCLE-BOUND JUVENILE DELINQUENTS.

494
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,180
HONEY...

495
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,820
THAT'S WHAT EVERY GOOD GIRL SAYS

496
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,300
JUST BEFORE SHE BECOMES A BAD GIRL.

497
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:13,980
TRUST ME,I KNOW.

498
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,650
EXCEPT NOW WHEN WE'RE DONE,

499
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:23,230
I DON'T HAVE TO PROOFREAD 
YOUR ESSAY ON "ETHAN FROME."

500
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,060
AND I DON'T HAVE TO JUMP OUT 
OF A WINDOW. THAT'S A NICE CHANGE.

501
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:27,140
-YEAH.

502
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,230
HEY,HOW ABOUT I ORDER 
UP A BOTTLE OF DOM?

503
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:32,190
OOH,I LIKE RICH JOHN!

504
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,840
HELLO? OH! UH,HI.

505
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,820
NOTHING,UH,YOU KNOW,JUST,UH,
ROOM SERVICE AND A MOVIE.

506
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,470
WHAT?

507
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,890
REALLY? YOU'RE--YOU'RE KIDDING.

508
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,300
UH,NO! I'M--I'M THRILLED.

509
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,430
IT'S,UH,ROOM 424.

510
00:28:56,930 --> 00:28:59,390
ME,TOO. BYE.

511
00:28:59,390 --> 00:29:01,200
-YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.  
-WHAT?

512
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,710
MY FIANCéE'S ON HER WAY UP. OH!

513
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,920
-YOUR FIANCéE?  
-SHE WAS SUPPOSEDTO COME TOMORROW.

514
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,470
GUESS SHE DECIDED TO SURPRISE ME. 
GET DRESSED!

515
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,360
UH,YOU-- YOU'RE <i>ENGAGED?</i> 
TO WHO?!

516
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:13,240
HER NAME'S TAMMY. 
WHERE'S YOUR OTHER SHOE? !

517
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,710
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

518
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:16,880
I WOULD NEVER HAVE LET YOU SEDUCE ME 
IF I KNEW YOU WERE GETTING MARRIED.

519
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,900
WELL,YOU DIDN'T HAVE ANY PROBLEM SLEEPING 
WITH ME WHEN <i>YOU</i> WERE MARRIED!

520
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:21,990
YOU KNEW ABOUT CARLOS! 
MY CHEATING WAS UPFRONT AND HONEST.

521
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:25,410
LOOK,GABY,WE DON'T HAVE TIME 
FOR THIS. GET MOVING.

522
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:28,810
NO,I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. IN FACT,
I WANNA MEET THE BLUSHING BRIDE.

523
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,040
LISTEN TO ME,OKAY?

524
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:33,030
HER NAME IS TAMMY SINCLAIR,
AS IN SINCLAIR HOTELS,

525
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,170
AS IN HER FATHER OWNS 
THIS WHOLE DAMN CHAIN.

526
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:38,760
SO IF SHE CATCHES YOU IN HERE,
I AM TOTALLY SCREWED.

527
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:46,720
POODLE!

528
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:51,250
LOOK AT YOU,SURPRISING ME.

529
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,560
-OH,I MISSED YOU. 
-I MISSED YOU,TOO.

530
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,720
UGH,THIS ROOM BLOWS.

531
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,450
DADDY WAS SUPPOSED TO HOOK US UP 
WITH A SUITE.

532
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,440
YOU KNOW,YOU'RE RIGHT.

533
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,300
WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN 
TO THE FRONT DESK AND DEMAND ONE?

534
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,530
-COME ON.  
-OH,NO. THEY'RE ALL BOOKED.

535
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,890
THEY CALL THIS A CLOSET?

536
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:14,130
WHERE AM I SUPPOD TO PUT ALL MY STUFF?

537
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:18,020
YOU KNOW,I COULD REALLY USE A DRINK. 
WHY DON'T WE GO DOWN TO THE BAR?

538
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:22,140
I'M WIPED. I JUST WANNA STAY IN.

539
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:25,350
DIDN'T YOU UNPACK YET?

540
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,310
NO,UM,ACTUALLY,
THE--THE ZIPPER IS STUCK,

541
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:33,240
UM,BUT THEY HAVE A GUY 
AT THE HOTEL THAT CAN FIX IT.

542
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,270
YOU KNOW I SHOULD-- I SHOULD PROBABLY 
GO AHEAD AND TAKE IT DOWN TO THE LOBBY.

543
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,700
NOW?

544
00:30:38,430 --> 00:30:40,460
I'M HORNY.

545
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,180
SO AM I...

546
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:47,040
BUT I WILL BE A LOT HORNIER...

547
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,840
ONCE I GET RID OF THIS SUITCASE.

548
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,060
POODLE?

549
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,370
WHERE DID THIS DIAMOND WATCH COME FROM?

550
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,750
OH,SHOOT,UM...

551
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,900
THAT'S WHAT YOU GET 
FOR SURPRISING ME.

552
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,700
I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO WRAP IT.

553
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,390
YOU LIKE IT?

554
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:14,190
I LOVE IT!

555
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,230
-I'M NEVER TAKING IT OFF!  
-SON OF A BITCH!

556
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,980
COME HERE,YOU!

557
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,950
JOHN?

558
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,090
JOHN,WHERE ARE YOU,DAMN IT?

559
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,530
DON'T LAUGH. 
I SAVED A BUNDLE ON AIRFARE.

560
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,560
SUSAN,I'M SO--

561
00:32:57,830 --> 00:33:00,150
YOUR AZALEAS ARE BREATHTAKING.

562
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,870
THANK YOU. AHEM.

563
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,810
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF THEM.

564
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,500
YEAH,IT'S NICE TO KNOW 
TH I CAN RAISE SOME THINGS CORRECTLY.

565
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:12,440
DARLIN',BE PATIENT.

566
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:15,090
ANDREW WILL COME AROUND.

567
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:18,220
NO,I DON'T THINK HE WILL.

568
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,370
I FAILED HIM.

569
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:21,790
I THINK YOU'RE BEING 
TOO HARD ON YOURSELF.

570
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,030
AND YOU'RE NOT BEING HARD ENOUGH.

571
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,690
STOP SAYING THAT 
WHAT I DID WAS UNDERSTANDABLE.

572
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:28,720
I'M A MOTHER WHO ABANDONED HER CHILD.

573
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,940
THAT'S... UNNATURAL.

574
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:34,100
BREE,IT'S HOT. YOU'RE TIRED. 
WHY DON'T YOU COME INSIDE?

575
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,560
BECAUSE THERE IS A BOTTLE OF CHARDONNAY 
IN THE REFRIGERATOR,AND RIGHT NOW

576
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,100
THIS LITTLE CHORE IS THE ONLY THING 
THAT'S KEEPING ME FROM GOING INSIDE

577
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,160
AND DRINKING THE WHOLE DAMN THING.

578
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,820
WELL...

579
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:52,830
THE AZALEAS REALLY ARE LOVELY.

580
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,290
YE THEY ARE,AREN'T THEY?

581
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,050
HI.

582
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:24,280
LOOK,I'M SORRY.

583
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,990
HERE'S YOUR WATCH.

584
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,130
I GUESS I'LL JUST BUY TAMMY A NEW ONE.

585
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,850
DON'T YOU MEAN HER DADDY WILL BUY HER 
A NEW ONE AND JUST LAUNDER THE MONEY THROUGH YOU?

586
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,680
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR BEING ANGRY.

587
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,130
ALL RIGHT,I SHOULD'VE  
TOLD YOU THE TRUTH FROM THE START.

588
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:44,990
BUT WHEN I SAW YOU THERE 
IN THE MOONLIGHT,

589
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:47,830
IT TOOK ME RIGHT BACK 
TO WHEN WE WERE TOGETHER.

590
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,210
ME,TOO.

591
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,900
DO YOU WANNA SIT DOWN?

592
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:01,180
YOU KNOW,YOU'RE PRETTY HARD 
TO STAY MAD AT.

593
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,190
GOOD,

594
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:05,930
'CAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T WANT 
THIS TO END BADLY.

595
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:08,250
WHO SAYS IT HAS TO END?

596
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,380
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

597
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:14,220
WELL,I'M SINGLE NOW,
AND I THOUGHT WE COULD MAYBE...

598
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,730
GABY... I'M GETTING MARRIED.

599
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,160
SURE,AND I WAS MARRIED 
WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER.

600
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,580
RIGHT,BUT <i>THAT</i>

601
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,380
IS NOT HOW I'M GONNA BE MARRIED.

602
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,190
WELL,THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT,
BUT TRUST ME,MARRIAGE IS HARD.

603
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,990
I KNOW THAT,BUT...

604
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,710
I LOVE TAMMY,

605
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,070
AND I DON'T WANNA SCREW IT UP.

606
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:38,590
'CAUSE ENOUGH OF THOSE SCREWUPS AND...

607
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:41,420
YOU JUST END UP ALONE.

608
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,670
YEAH,THAT CAN HAPPEN.

609
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:59,150
GOOD-BYE,GABRIELLE.

610
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,150
UM,HEY,MISTER,UH,

611
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:17,320
COULD YOU SPARE A BUCK OR 2? 
I'M--I'M REALLY HUNGRY.

612
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,930
HEY,THANKS!

613
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,840
I'LL GIVE YOU $50 MORE,
YOU LET ME BUY YOU LUNCH.

614
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:29,550
FRIES AND A LARGE ROOT BEER.

615
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:34,600
WHAT AM I GONNA HAVE 
TO DO TO EARN THIS?

616
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,460
I TOLD YOU,I JUST WANNA TALK TO YOU.

617
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:39,060
-YOU ANOTHER REPORTER? -NO.

618
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,350
YOU A YOUTH PASTOR? YOU TRYING 
TO SAVE MY SOUL?

619
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,230
OH,YOU MAKE IT SOUND LIKE A CHALLENGE.

620
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:47,860
NO,I JUST WANNA UNDERSTAND YOU,ANDREW.

621
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:51,500
WAIT,HOW DID YOU KNOW MY NAME?

622
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,480
YOU'RE HIM,AREN'T Y? YOU'RE,UH...

623
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,450
THE NEW HUSBAND.

624
00:36:59,450 --> 00:37:01,440
ORSON.

625
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,510
YOU KNOW,I WOULDN'T TALK TO HER.
 AT MAKES HER THINK I'LL LISTEN TO YOU?

626
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:08,210
YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T KNOW I'M HERE.

627
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,240
ALL RIGHT,<i>DAD.</i>

628
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,390
WHAT DO YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT,
<i>DAD?</i>

629
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:16,080
I WANNA KNOW HOW YOU SURVIVE OUT HERE. 
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR MONEY?

630
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,110
I ASK. PEOPLE GIVE IT TO ME.

631
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,180
THAT'S IT?

632
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,120
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW?

633
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,730
HAVE--HAVE I DONE STUFF FOR MONEY 
THAT I'M NOT PROUD OF?

634
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:37,470
YEAH,SURE,BUT YOU FIGURED THAT OUT 
AS SOON I ASKED YOU WHAT THE $50 WAS FOR.

635
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,060
BUT,UH...

636
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,930
DON'T--DON'T TELL MY MOM.

637
00:37:40,930 --> 00:37:44,910
OR--OR YOU KNOW WHAT? DO. WHO CARES?

638
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,140
WELL,I THINK PART OF YOU WANTS ME TO TELL HER 
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT WOULD HURT HER.

639
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,190
I MEAN,THAT'S WHY YOU'RE OUT HERE,
ISN'T IT? TO PUNISH HER.

640
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,740
WHEN WILL YOU HAVE PUNISHED  HER ENOUGH,
ANDREW?

641
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,410
WHEN YOU TURN TO DRUGS  TO NUMB THE PAIN,

642
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:00,500
OR YOU CATCH A DISEASE  
YOU'LL NEVER BE RID OF?

643
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,910
DON'T PRETEND TO CARE  
ABOUT ME,ALL RIGHT?

644
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:06,540
I DO CARE ABOUT YOU,
BECAUSE BREE CARES ABOUT YOU,

645
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,270
BECAUSE WE'RE MORE ALIKE  
THAN YOU THINK.

646
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,170
I KNOW ABOUT RAGE.

647
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:16,330
I KNOW HOW IT EATS YOU UP. 
BUT RAGE GOES AWAY,

648
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:18,350
AND WHEN IT DOES,

649
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,680
YOU'RE JUST LEFT 
 WITH THE MESS YOU'VE MADE.

650
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,090
THKS FOR LUNCH.

651
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:29,140
YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
YOU KNOW WHEREO FIND US.

652
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,360
HOW'S YOUR BACK?

653
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,720
IF I DON'T BREATHE,GREAT.

654
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,070
GOD,IT HAS BEEN SO LONG  
SINCE MY BACK HAS ACTED UP.

655
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,570
THEN WHAM,OUT OF THE BLUE,
I'M CRYING BY A TREE STUMP.

656
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:56,630
WELL,YOU'RE UNDER A LOT OF STRESS.

657
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:59,640
YOU GOT A NEW KID IN THE FAMILY. 
YOU'RE JOB HUNTING.

658
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,880
UGH. ARE WE GONNA FIGHT ABOUT 
THAT AGAIN? 'CAUSE IF SO,

659
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,030
I'M GONNA NEED THOSE LAST FOUR  
MUSCLE RELAXANTS.

660
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:09,630
NO,I DON'T WANNA FIGHT. IN FACT,
I WAS THINKING...

661
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,190
IF YOU CAN'T FIND SOMETHING  
YOU LIKE IN ADVERTISING,

662
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:16,110
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CAST A WIDER NET.

663
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,890
MEANING WHAT?

664
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,110
YOU'RE A BRIGHT GUY. ISN'T THERE ANYTHING 
ELSE YOU MIGHT WANNA DO?

665
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,740
I'D LIKE TO PLAY BS FOR AEROSMITH.

666
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,710
OKAY,LET'S CALL THAT THE BACKUP PLAN.

667
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:32,280
BUT,SERIOUSLY,DON'T YOU HAVE  S
OME ROAD NOT TAKEN,

668
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,070
SOME DREAM YOU NEVER GOT AROUND TO?

669
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,830
I DON'T KNMAYBE.

670
00:39:40,430 --> 00:39:41,960
MAYBE?

671
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:45,000
I DON'T KNOW. YOU GET MARRIED.  
YOU HAVE KIDS AND...

672
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,490
YOU LOSE TRACK OF THAT STUFF.

673
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:51,470
WELL,THINK ABOUT IT,OKAY?

674
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:55,790
CAUSE WHATEVER YOU WANNA DO,
I'M IN YOUR CORNER.

675
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,250
MAN,DID I LUCK OUT MARRYING YOU.

676
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,760
TELL ME SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW.

677
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,960
HI,MIKE.

678
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,290
IT'S EDIE.

679
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,910
I'M SORRY THAT I HAVEN'T 
COME BY TO VISIT.

680
00:40:26,050 --> 00:40:28,060
PRETTY ROUGH LUCK,HUH?

681
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:33,400
ANYWAY,I'M,UM...

682
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,140
HERE TO PICK UP MY CD PLAYER.

683
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:38,410
SO...

684
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:47,840
WELL,I HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON.

685
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,560
DAMN!

686
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:07,360
AND THAT'S <i>WITH</i> THE COMA.

687
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,030
<i>WE ALL CARRY SOMETHING WITH US.</i>

688
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,360
<i>OF COURSE,IT'S NICE</i>   
<i>IF WE TRAVEL WITH SOMEONE</i>

689
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:34,000
<i>WHO CAN HELP LIGHTEN THE LOAD.</i>

690
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,580
<i>BUT USUALLY IT'S EASIER</i> 
<i>TO JUST DROP WHAT WE'VE BEEN CARRYING</i>

691
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:46,290
<i>SO WE CAN GET HOME</i>   
<i>THAT MUCH SOONER...</i>

692
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,130
<i>ASSUMING,OF COURSE,</i>

693
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,180
<i>THERE WILL BE SOMEONE THERE</i>   
<i>TO GREET US WHEN WE ARRIVE.</i>

694
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,920
<i>WHY DO WE CLUTCH</i>   
<i>AT THIS BAGGAGE</i>

695
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:04,200
<i>EVEN WHEN WE'RE DESPERATE</i>   
<i>TO MOVE ON?</i>

696
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:10,930
<i>BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW</i>   
<i>THERE'S A CHANCE</i>

697
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,600
<i>WE MIGHT LET GO TOO SOON.</i>
