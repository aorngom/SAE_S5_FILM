00:00:00,416 --> 00:00:02,247
<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:03,712
<i>A proposal was made...</i>

3
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,590
Your niece came to my restaurant
asked me for a hostessing job.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,045
- I'm sorry.
- <i>Another was broken.</i>

5
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:11,219
- You don't have...
- Mike, please.

6
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,843
- <i>A secret was kept...</i>
- Carlos is gonna find out eventually.

7
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:19,062
By then, I will have proved
I can do the job, pregnant or not.

8
00:00:19,229 --> 00:00:21,600
She's still unconscious.
I'd like to run some tests.

9
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,060
- <i>Another revealed...</i>
- Julie's pregnant.

10
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:34,574
<i>Bree Van De Kamp
was having an affair.</i>

11
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,734
<i>And whenever her lover called...</i>

12
00:00:39,953 --> 00:00:42,798
<i>She needed an excuse
to leave work early.</i>

13
00:00:45,036 --> 00:00:48,224
I'm off to the jeweler's.
Gotta get my pearls restrung.

14
00:00:50,401 --> 00:00:53,504
I'm off to the salon.
Gotta keep this red hair red.

15
00:00:55,535 --> 00:00:58,739
I have to visit my aunt in the hospital.
She has shingles.

16
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:02,741
<i>But on this particular day,</i>

17
00:01:02,911 --> 00:01:04,893
<i>Bree was surprised to find</i>

18
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:08,181
<i>Her work had been done for her.</i>

19
00:01:10,886 --> 00:01:11,886
Morning!

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,861
It's barely 9:00.
How long have you been cooking?

21
00:01:15,248 --> 00:01:17,739
I don't know.
Since 3:00? 4:00?

22
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:20,492
You don't need to do
this whole luncheon by yourself.

23
00:01:20,752 --> 00:01:22,041
I don't mind.

24
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:24,508
When I'm happy,
I have all this excess energy.

25
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:27,768
- Gotta channel it somewhere.
- You must be pretty darn happy.

26
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:29,465
Any particular reason?

27
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:31,764
Isn't it obvious?

28
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:33,588
I'm in love.

29
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:35,944
That's wonderful!

30
00:01:36,114 --> 00:01:38,229
Why didn't you tell me
you were seeing someone?

31
00:01:38,396 --> 00:01:42,013
You know what? It doesn't matter. The
main thing is you're finally over Mike.

32
00:01:43,173 --> 00:01:44,349
I'm not over Mike.

33
00:01:45,972 --> 00:01:46,976
You're not?

34
00:01:47,236 --> 00:01:49,604
No, silly. Who'd you think
I was in love with?

35
00:01:52,007 --> 00:01:53,817
But Mike just married Susan.

36
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:57,622
Honey. Their first marriage
went down in flames.

37
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,661
This one's gonna crash even faster.

38
00:01:59,831 --> 00:02:01,991
They're not even sleeping together.

39
00:02:02,585 --> 00:02:04,119
What makes you say that?

40
00:02:04,655 --> 00:02:08,467
Last night, The light in their
upstairs den was on at 3:00 A.M.

41
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:10,802
That doesn't mean anything.

42
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:13,461
Maybe Susan wanted to read
without waking him.

43
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,109
Mike made a mistake and he knows it.

44
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,265
He's just waiting for Julie to
feel better, and then he'll dump Susan

45
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:23,054
and beg me to take him back.

46
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:28,184
So... grab an apron.
We still have dessert to make.

47
00:02:30,425 --> 00:02:31,789
I'm thinking tarte tatin.

48
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,941
It's Mike's favorite.
We'll make an extra one for him.

49
00:02:35,895 --> 00:02:37,069
<i>Poor Bree.</i>

50
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:39,553
<i>She wanted to help her friend.</i>

51
00:02:40,873 --> 00:02:42,574
<i>Bree... are you coming?
Karl</i>

52
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,478
<i>But she didn't have time to deal with
Katherine's imaginary lover...</i>

53
00:02:48,852 --> 00:02:52,448
I have a teeth cleaning,
so I won't be able to help you.

54
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:56,119
<i>Not when she had a real one.</i>

63
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,400

00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:30,656

<i>The sad truth is,</i>

66
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:36,461
<i>we don't know our friends
and neighbors</i>

67
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:39,547

68
00:03:40,775 --> 00:03:42,860

69
00:03:43,732 --> 00:03:45,220
<i>Keep secrets.</i>

70
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,668
Need coffee.

71
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:52,105
This isn't helping you
get your coffee.

72
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,254
Whatever.
It's wakin' me up.

73
00:03:56,813 --> 00:04:00,568
Hey, bud. What are you still doin' home?
I thought you had a morning class.

74
00:04:01,297 --> 00:04:03,530
Actually, I'm thinking
about quitting school.

75
00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:06,658
What?

76
00:04:07,468 --> 00:04:09,410
I thought I might get a job.

77
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,460
Our family's been in
this country five generations.

78
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:15,713
It's time one of us got a diploma.

79
00:04:18,954 --> 00:04:20,887
What's going on?
Talk to me.

80
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:25,415
No one talks to me at school,

81
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:29,764
no one sits near me, everybody
thinks I'm the perv who attacked Julie.

82
00:04:34,572 --> 00:04:36,271
This is a temporary thing.

83
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,900
The police are gonna catch this guy
and everyone will know you are innocent.

84
00:04:41,624 --> 00:04:44,206
But meanwhile, I'm the campus freak.

85
00:04:46,108 --> 00:04:48,322
Do me a favor.
Let's talk about this later.

86
00:04:48,492 --> 00:04:50,133
If you go to school today,

87
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,333
we'll figure something out
when you get home.

88
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,883
Why you being so nice to him?

89
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:08,296
There is no way we are
lettin' him drop out of school.

90
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:09,888
I know that,

91
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:11,742
but we have to be careful here.

92
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:14,919
You know Danny...
When he gets unhappy, he gets sloppy,

93
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,682
Says all sorts of things
he shouldn't.

94
00:05:22,478 --> 00:05:25,987
So now all we've gotta do is
figure out how to make a teenager happy.

95
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,413
Damn it!

96
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:32,183
What's the matter?

97
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:34,928
Nothing fits.

98
00:05:35,342 --> 00:05:37,498
My breasts have gotten huge.

99
00:05:38,886 --> 00:05:40,460
I hate it when that happens.

100
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:43,330
Every time I'm pregnant...
Second trimester

101
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,943
like clockwork.

102
00:05:47,998 --> 00:05:50,272
- Why are you smiling?
- Why do you think?

103
00:05:50,442 --> 00:05:52,249
"The supremes" are back.

104
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:56,684
What did I tell you about naming
them after musical groups?

105
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:58,815
I know.
It's just that

106
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:02,357
"Benny And The Jets"
are so happy to see 'em.

107
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:05,576
This is serious.

108
00:06:05,746 --> 00:06:07,253
I have to hide these things

109
00:06:07,423 --> 00:06:09,867
so Carlos doesn't find out
I'm pregnant.

110
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,650
What am I gonna do with you guys?

111
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,868
- I got some ideas.
- I got a meeting.

112
00:06:14,712 --> 00:06:17,348
But they're like this
for two weeks until they get all sore,

113
00:06:17,518 --> 00:06:20,221
and you give me
that "don't touch me" look.

114
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:21,446
Good-Bye, Tom.

115
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:24,294
Come on. Call in sick.

116
00:06:24,844 --> 00:06:26,773
Kids get snow days.

117
00:06:26,943 --> 00:06:29,258
We could call it a boob day.

118
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,389
It is way too early
for the "don't touch me" look.

119
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,556
So I waited around all morning,

120
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:43,872
for that repairman that you told
me to call, and he never showed.

121
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:46,784
No, I'm not done.
I'm sharing my day with you.

122
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:50,569
Then your children took my $300
perfume and gave their dolls a bath.

123
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:55,454
Yes, I spent $300 on perfume.
But you're missing the point!

124
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,496
Really?
You don't like it when I yell?

125
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:01,105
How about this?

126
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:07,964
I have taken care of your demon spawn
children for 12 hours. My shift is over.

127
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:21,230
You having fun
working at the restaurant?

128
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,500
I'm having fun working with you.

129
00:07:24,447 --> 00:07:25,874
Look who's here.

130
00:07:28,367 --> 00:07:29,759
I was talking to her.

131
00:07:29,926 --> 00:07:32,030
So, I thought
I was gonna pick you up.

132
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:35,283
- John offered to give me a ride.
- I appreciated the company.

133
00:07:37,715 --> 00:07:39,620
Time to go inside.
Someone's got homework.

134
00:07:41,555 --> 00:07:42,555
Night.

135
00:07:44,287 --> 00:07:45,753
You remember homework,

136
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,004
that thing that kids
in high school have to do?

137
00:07:48,264 --> 00:07:50,715
I remember it. I think you used
to help me with mine.

138
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:55,136
- What are you doing with her?
- I take care of my employees.

139
00:07:55,396 --> 00:07:57,221
Do you drive the busboys home, too?

140
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:01,517
I will pick her up from now on.

141
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,856
Come on.

142
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:05,907
Hey there.

143
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:08,399
- How's she doing?
- Much better.

144
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:11,093
The doctor says the swelling
in her brain has subsided

145
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,182
and she could come to at any moment.

146
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:14,715
That's terrific.

147
00:08:14,882 --> 00:08:17,006
You should see the flowers
Andrew brought you.

148
00:08:17,176 --> 00:08:18,467
They're gorgeous.

149
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,498
It's the least I could do.

150
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:23,247
Julie knows how I feel
about her. Don't you, Jules?

151
00:08:23,507 --> 00:08:25,934
I love that you two have
stayed friends all these years.

152
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:28,276
We lost touch
when she was in med school,

153
00:08:28,446 --> 00:08:30,254
but ever since she quit...

154
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:33,091
We talk all the time.

155
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,383
She quit?

156
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,429
I thought she told you.
It was six months ago.

157
00:08:38,689 --> 00:08:40,640
She's been out of school
for six months?

158
00:08:41,984 --> 00:08:44,060
You are so lucky
you're in a coma right now.

159
00:08:44,438 --> 00:08:46,312
What has she been doing
all this time?

160
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:49,220
She didn't know what she
wanted to do with her life, so,

161
00:08:49,387 --> 00:08:52,693
while she was deciding,
she got herself a job, waiting tables.

162
00:08:53,382 --> 00:08:54,682
Did you just say

163
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:56,697
"waiting tables"?

164
00:08:57,137 --> 00:08:59,677
- I thought she...
- Told me? No, she didn't.

165
00:09:01,161 --> 00:09:02,532
This is unreal.

166
00:09:03,044 --> 00:09:06,415
Yesterday, I found out
Julie thought she was pregnant.

167
00:09:06,675 --> 00:09:09,373
And now I'm finding out
that my daughter the surgeon

168
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:12,241
is actually my daughter
the... waitress.

169
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,608
I'm gonna need a moment.

170
00:09:15,893 --> 00:09:17,802
- Take your time. I'll just...
- Wait!

171
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,519
- The guy.
- What guy?

172
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:24,114
Julie was seeing some guy.
You two talk all the time.

173
00:09:24,784 --> 00:09:26,102
What do you know?

174
00:09:27,274 --> 00:09:29,438
It'd be an excellent time
to wake up and help me.

175
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:31,357
Who is he?

176
00:09:32,618 --> 00:09:34,362
He may be the one that attacked her.

177
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,550
All I know is there was a guy,

178
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,622
- but I don't know his name.
- Please. Why would she tell you she was

179
00:09:39,789 --> 00:09:42,520
- seeing someone and not say who?
- Because he's married.

180
00:09:49,198 --> 00:09:51,085
- What you got there?
- Mints.

181
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:52,791
Mints?

182
00:09:53,904 --> 00:09:55,209
Mints that are...

183
00:09:56,022 --> 00:09:57,800
"Ribbed for her pleasure"?!

184
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,303
We found a whole box
of them under Ana's bed.

185
00:10:03,107 --> 00:10:04,682
Can I have one before dinner?

186
00:10:05,453 --> 00:10:08,692
No, you can't eat these! These...
aren't mints. They're...

187
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:09,859
balloons.

188
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:13,694
Grownup balloons.

189
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,735
Do you and daddy play with them?

190
00:10:16,716 --> 00:10:20,036
If we did, you and I wouldn't
be having this conversation.

191
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:22,828
Nice knock.

192
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,035
What are these?

193
00:10:25,268 --> 00:10:26,880
Those are condoms.

194
00:10:27,047 --> 00:10:28,998
When a boy and a girl
like each other...

195
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:32,043
Shut it. Juanita and Celia
found these under your bed.

196
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:34,855
- I want a lock on my door.
- I've got news for you.

197
00:10:35,022 --> 00:10:37,050
That is not
where the lock is gonna go.

198
00:10:37,217 --> 00:10:39,446
- This is really none of your business.
- Sorry.

199
00:10:39,613 --> 00:10:42,220
17 plus condoms?
Totally my business.

200
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,348
What's the story? Are you
sleeping with John Rowland?

201
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:47,391
Aunt Gaby, he's my boss.

202
00:10:48,287 --> 00:10:50,770
And the oscar goes to...
Not you.

203
00:10:51,537 --> 00:10:52,654
Fine.

204
00:10:53,259 --> 00:10:54,815
But we haven't done anything...

205
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,908
- Yet.
- "Yet"? Why is there a "Yet"?

206
00:10:59,362 --> 00:11:00,412
I love him.

207
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,758
Did you hear me?

208
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,409
I said I love him.

209
00:11:07,097 --> 00:11:08,996
I heard you.
I was swallowing vomit.

210
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:12,541
You and John... Not gonna happen.

211
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:15,547
What is it about John
that gets you so crazy?

212
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:17,942
- He was just your gardener.
- I'm not crazy!

213
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,757
And this conversation is over.

214
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:26,329
I promised the girls
they could fill these of water

215
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:28,085
and drop them off the roof.

216
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,855
Porter.
Can I talk to you?

217
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,359
Sorry. I've gotta go pick up Penny.

218
00:11:48,569 --> 00:11:49,996
This'll just take a minute.

219
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,150
This friday night,
what do you say you help me

220
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,878
- throw Danny a party at our place?
- A party?

221
00:11:58,138 --> 00:11:59,630
He needs to make some friends.

222
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,466
He's a little shy, and this
thing with Julie has not helped.

223
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:04,901
Here's the thing.
Danny and I don't hang out.

224
00:12:05,068 --> 00:12:06,679
We don't have that much in common.

225
00:12:09,218 --> 00:12:10,692
Danny likes money.

226
00:12:10,862 --> 00:12:12,143
Do you like money?

227
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:14,238
Sure.

228
00:12:14,843 --> 00:12:16,981
See? You do have
something in common.

229
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,691
Are you bribing me?

230
00:12:19,944 --> 00:12:21,651
This is to pay for the party.

231
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,988
And, of course, if there's
a little left over...

232
00:12:25,792 --> 00:12:27,238
And I almost forgot.

233
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:30,453
You can't have a party without beer.

234
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:34,165
Is this a trick? Is my mother
hiding to see if I take the bait?

235
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:37,118
I just want him to have a good time.

236
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:40,755
So make sure you invite some nice
people, maybe a couple of cute girls.

237
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:45,580
Anything for my good friend Danny.

238
00:12:48,775 --> 00:12:51,296
All right, how about this one?

239
00:12:51,466 --> 00:12:54,518
It's a lovely 4-Tier cake
with pink fondant.

240
00:12:58,482 --> 00:13:00,734
After showing you 43 cake designs,

241
00:13:00,904 --> 00:13:04,320
I've learned that "hmm" means "no."
But you're getting married in two days,

242
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:07,327
so unless you wanna shove wedding
jell-O into each other's faces,

243
00:13:07,494 --> 00:13:09,829
- you need to make a decision.
- I'm sorry.

244
00:13:09,996 --> 00:13:12,218
We just want everything
to be perfect and...

245
00:13:14,915 --> 00:13:16,295
What's this one?

246
00:13:17,468 --> 00:13:20,795
This must be a new design
by my partner Katherine. You like it?

247
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:23,381
- I love it.
- Wonderful.

248
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,171
Now...
what flavor do you want?

249
00:13:27,341 --> 00:13:30,513
I would suggest a classic
white cake with raspberry genoise.

250
00:13:40,669 --> 00:13:42,986
Notice anything
different about Lynette?

251
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:44,620
What are you talking about?

252
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,444
Check her out from
the christmas party.

253
00:13:47,611 --> 00:13:48,614
Before...

254
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,534
After.

255
00:13:54,155 --> 00:13:55,812
Lynette got implants.

256
00:13:55,982 --> 00:13:58,770
Definitely.
And look at those puppies.

257
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:01,585
Aren't you gay?

258
00:14:02,636 --> 00:14:04,046
You can't ask me that.

259
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:08,343
If you're not, I'll punch you in the
face for checking out my married friend.

260
00:14:09,894 --> 00:14:12,228
So gay!
Judy-Liza-Barbra gay!

261
00:14:12,398 --> 00:14:14,473
Proud member since '89!

262
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,200
So for the third quarter,

263
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:24,608
net income increased by 20%
compared to...

264
00:14:26,787 --> 00:14:29,540
- What are you looking at?
- Sorry, Lynette. I just...

265
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,324
I know.

266
00:14:33,381 --> 00:14:34,785
You know what?

267
00:14:35,823 --> 00:14:37,246
Your little secret.

268
00:14:40,979 --> 00:14:42,626
You know about the twins?

269
00:14:44,293 --> 00:14:45,671
I have eyes.

270
00:14:46,225 --> 00:14:48,382
First of all, this was not planned.

271
00:14:49,106 --> 00:14:50,134
It wasn't?

272
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,680
Tom and I went out to dinner, he got
me drunk, and the next thing I knew...

273
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:58,767
So Tom's responsible for all this.

274
00:15:00,347 --> 00:15:01,520
Who else?

275
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,497
You are such a good wife.

276
00:15:04,667 --> 00:15:07,234
I wish you'd talk to Gaby,
get her to jump on the bandwagon.

277
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,821
Doesn't Gaby already have her
hands full with the two she's got?

278
00:15:11,774 --> 00:15:14,867
They're okay. I always
thought we could do better.

279
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:17,912
- What?!
- Gaby really looks up to you.

280
00:15:19,214 --> 00:15:21,874
If she knew you got a boob job,
she might consider it.

281
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,374
Boob job?

282
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,753
Sorry. Breast enhancement.

283
00:15:26,818 --> 00:15:30,216
Just give her the name of your doctor.
He did great work.

284
00:15:36,091 --> 00:15:37,091
Got it.

285
00:15:37,762 --> 00:15:38,762
Sure.

286
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,020
By the way, let this be a lesson to you.
Don't try to hide things from me.

287
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,543
I'm a little too sharp for that.

288
00:15:51,508 --> 00:15:52,532
<i>Here.</i>

289
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:57,195
I just got called on a job.
It's just a busted water main,

290
00:15:57,365 --> 00:15:59,099
So I should be back by...

291
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:05,918
- What happened here?
- I came across Julie's journal.

292
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:10,005
She never says his name.

293
00:16:10,265 --> 00:16:11,314
Whose name?

294
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:14,291
The married man.
She doesn't use his name.

295
00:16:14,461 --> 00:16:16,809
She just uses the initial..."D."

296
00:16:18,774 --> 00:16:21,141
Why would she use a code
in her own journal?

297
00:16:21,401 --> 00:16:23,727
Because she's afraid
her mom might come across it?

298
00:16:24,646 --> 00:16:27,416
I know that I am
invading her privacy.

299
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:30,019
Screw it.
This is an emergency.

300
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,931
I bet this D. is
the sick bastard who...

301
00:16:41,953 --> 00:16:43,756
And you know the worst part?

302
00:16:44,069 --> 00:16:45,524
I read this and...

303
00:16:47,195 --> 00:16:49,552
It's like it was written
by a stranger.

304
00:16:51,464 --> 00:16:53,088
Who is this girl?

305
00:16:54,586 --> 00:16:56,260
She dropped out of med school,

306
00:16:58,427 --> 00:17:01,177
she leaves her full scholarship
to wait tables,

307
00:17:01,347 --> 00:17:05,021
and then when she came back, she
started an affair with a married man.

308
00:17:05,955 --> 00:17:07,896
I don't know that Julie.

309
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:12,574
What is going on with her?

310
00:17:15,521 --> 00:17:16,530
Really?

311
00:17:18,083 --> 00:17:20,533
You can ask her yourself.
She's awake.

312
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:28,772
- How is she? Can I see her?
- Just so you know,

313
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:31,153
she doesn't remember
anything about being attacked.

314
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:34,120
She's very tired and needs her rest,
so just sit with her.

315
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:36,197
- No questions.
- Of course.

316
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,607
I'll just... sit.

317
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,914
It is so good to see you awake.

318
00:17:50,073 --> 00:17:52,114
How are you feeling?

319
00:17:52,284 --> 00:17:53,942
Wait. I forgot.

320
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:55,717
Doctor said no questions.

321
00:17:55,887 --> 00:17:58,487
So... I'm just gonna sit here

322
00:17:58,657 --> 00:18:00,629
and... look at you.

323
00:18:01,786 --> 00:18:02,786
Thanks.

324
00:18:03,095 --> 00:18:04,370
I'm really tired.

325
00:18:05,089 --> 00:18:06,580
You just sleep, baby.

326
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,506
Just so you know,
you're not pregnant.

327
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,840
What?

328
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:19,855
Lynette said
you were scared you might be.

329
00:18:20,025 --> 00:18:21,548
But you're not, so...

330
00:18:23,218 --> 00:18:24,848
She shouldn't have told you that.

331
00:18:25,763 --> 00:18:27,447
Now I've upset you.
I'm sorry.

332
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,363
Just ignore me and you sleep.

333
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:42,405
If you want,

334
00:18:42,575 --> 00:18:45,119
I could tell your boyfriend
that you're better.

335
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:47,204
My boyfriend?

336
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:50,855
I knew you
thought that you were pregnant,

337
00:18:51,025 --> 00:18:53,778
and I don't see you going the
turkey baster route, so I assumed

338
00:18:53,948 --> 00:18:55,813
that you had a boyfriend.

339
00:18:56,812 --> 00:18:58,503
I could call him for you.

340
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,799
Unless you think he strangled you
because he's married.

341
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:04,430
I don't want to talk about this now.

342
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:07,596
Then we won't.

343
00:19:07,974 --> 00:19:09,344
I'm not even here.

344
00:19:09,767 --> 00:19:10,897
You just rest.

345
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:14,106
How can I rest when you come
in here with all these questions?

346
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:16,558
Have I asked you
one single question?

347
00:19:17,109 --> 00:19:19,403
- Besides that one?
- I think you should go.

348
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:22,131
Please.
I am your mom.

349
00:19:22,301 --> 00:19:25,117
There is not a thing
that you can't tell me.

350
00:19:25,605 --> 00:19:26,605
I know,

351
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:28,328
and I'm telling you to go.

352
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,591
I miss you, too.

353
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,178
A peach nightgown. Why?

354
00:19:49,019 --> 00:19:51,143
We are not doing this
on the phone again!

355
00:19:51,506 --> 00:19:53,626
If you can't sleep, take a pill.

356
00:20:18,008 --> 00:20:21,512
Katherine, I'm glad you're here.
We... really need to talk.

357
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:25,307
If it's about ordering the tents for
the Henderson reunion, already done.

358
00:20:25,757 --> 00:20:28,560
I saw you at Mike and Susan's
last night.

359
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:32,065
You were spying on me?

360
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,566
I am not the spy in this story.

361
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:38,153
Okay, you saw me.
Want to know what I saw?

362
00:20:38,941 --> 00:20:41,264
Susan went to bed early

363
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:43,933
and Mike watched a ball game.

364
00:20:44,399 --> 00:20:47,704
- That sound like a marriage to you?
- That sounds exactly like a marriage.

365
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:49,738
All I know is,

366
00:20:49,905 --> 00:20:52,834
it was really nice to watch
a ball game with Mike again.

367
00:20:53,739 --> 00:20:55,003
Through a window!

368
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:58,600
You are losing your grip here.

369
00:20:58,767 --> 00:21:01,115
Mike loves Susan. He is
not coming back to you.

370
00:21:01,282 --> 00:21:04,346
And if you can't accept that,
then you really need to get some help.

371
00:21:05,692 --> 00:21:08,015
You just cannot stand
to see me happy, can you?

372
00:21:08,266 --> 00:21:11,218
- Okay, I realize you're upset...
- Because you know

373
00:21:11,385 --> 00:21:15,064
that once I get Mike back, I am gonna
have more in my life than just work.

374
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:17,359
And I'm not gonna be able
to do your job for you.

375
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:20,369
- Excuse me?
- You're never here anymore.

376
00:21:20,536 --> 00:21:22,838
You're always so busy these days.

377
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:26,127
But you're never too busy to take
bows for the food that I cooked

378
00:21:26,294 --> 00:21:28,370
and I am tired of carrying you!

379
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,928
That's gonna stop right now
because I am putting you

380
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:33,652
on sick leave for three weeks
effective immediately.

381
00:21:33,819 --> 00:21:36,713
- I'm not sick.
- Yes, you are.

382
00:21:39,161 --> 00:21:40,173
Now go.

383
00:21:49,354 --> 00:21:51,393
You've got some admirers out there.

384
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:56,064
As you walked by, I heard one of them
say "Check out the rack on that one."

385
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,334
- Can I do the honors and call security?
- No, and here's why.

386
00:22:02,693 --> 00:22:04,229
They're the Bertollini brothers.

387
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:07,701
They've got a $200 million pension fund
they're looking for somebody to run.

388
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:11,329
Why are you telling this to
"the rack"?

389
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:14,408
Just listen. We take them to dinner,

390
00:22:14,753 --> 00:22:18,753
they admire the girls up close and
personal, then we close the deal.

391
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:22,466
And then they leave the money
on the dresser, right?

392
00:22:24,218 --> 00:22:26,323
- What, you're mad?
- Of course I'm mad.

393
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:28,513
You can't use my breasts as bait.

394
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:31,023
Where do you get this attitude?

395
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,548
Come on. You don't buy
Christmas ornaments

396
00:22:33,715 --> 00:22:35,979
unless you're gonna
hang 'em on a tree.

397
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:38,329
Okay, bad metaphor. My point is,

398
00:22:39,221 --> 00:22:42,823
why would you get those things if
you don't want people looking at them?

399
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:43,990
I guess...

400
00:22:46,923 --> 00:22:48,379
I wouldn't have.

401
00:22:55,264 --> 00:22:57,793
- When do we do this?
- Tomorow night.

402
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,343
And if it makes you feel any better,

403
00:23:00,743 --> 00:23:02,372
buy yourself a new dress...

404
00:23:02,539 --> 00:23:03,715
on the company.

405
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:10,681
A man just gave me a credit
card because of my boobs.

406
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:14,204
That makes me feel
less like a hooker.

407
00:23:21,249 --> 00:23:22,315
What's up?

408
00:23:22,482 --> 00:23:24,403
If my niece has her way, her skirt.

409
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,889
- Excuse me?
- You pulled out the old

410
00:23:27,056 --> 00:23:30,388
John Rowland charm
and now Ana has fallen for you.

411
00:23:30,834 --> 00:23:33,870
So she has a little crush.
I think it's sweet.

412
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:37,076
"Sweet" would be doodling
your name in her notebook.

413
00:23:37,243 --> 00:23:40,210
Ana bought condoms
in what looked like a valu-pack.

414
00:23:42,137 --> 00:23:44,316
I had no idea she was that serious.

415
00:23:44,483 --> 00:23:47,299
I mean, I was only flirting with her...
a little.

416
00:23:48,024 --> 00:23:49,636
Well, she's 17,

417
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,264
so you're also flirting
with an orange jumpsuit.

418
00:23:52,515 --> 00:23:55,763
- You're pretty worked up about this.
- You should be, too.

419
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,834
If you lay one finger on Ana, Carlos
will knock every tooth out of your mouth

420
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:02,190
which will make you pretty
darn popular in prison.

421
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,177
I'm not really into Ana.

422
00:24:04,344 --> 00:24:07,111
Okay, I was flirting with her
to see if you still cared.

423
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,364
And obviously, you do.

424
00:24:10,805 --> 00:24:12,074
No, I don't.

425
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:13,639
Really?

426
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:17,913
If you weren't jealous, then why'd you
forbid me to drive Ana home?

427
00:24:18,164 --> 00:24:21,126
Because I remember what
you could accomplish in a parked car.

428
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:24,142
I think about those days a lot.

429
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:26,131
I was just a kid.

430
00:24:26,382 --> 00:24:28,175
I had to mow lawns for a living,

431
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,594
and I couldn't offer you
anything but... but sex.

432
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:33,430
But now
I can offer you so much more.

433
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,264
What are you talking about?

434
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:37,480
I have a lot of money now, Gaby.

435
00:24:37,647 --> 00:24:41,187
And you're stuck in a house with
two kids and a husband who's never home.

436
00:24:41,754 --> 00:24:45,357
And when I saw you again, with
macaroni and cheese on your T-shirt

437
00:24:45,608 --> 00:24:46,958
I said to myself,

438
00:24:47,125 --> 00:24:49,277
"what a shame. This gorgeous woman

439
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:52,365
should be sipping champagne
on a yacht."

440
00:24:53,488 --> 00:24:55,367
So... what, you're gonna rescue me?

441
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:58,349
- Tell me you're not unhappy.
- I'm not.

442
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,710
Why don't I believe you?

443
00:25:10,426 --> 00:25:11,426
Ana, wait!

444
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,611
He isn't home yet.

445
00:25:31,787 --> 00:25:34,110
Ana, we have to talk.

446
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,284
You knew that I liked him.
How could you do this?

447
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:40,622
Okay, what you saw wasn't
what you thought it was.

448
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,749
Did you slip, and your tongue
accidentally fell into John's mouth?

449
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,251
I didn't kiss John! John kissed me!

450
00:25:46,418 --> 00:25:48,130
And no tongues were involved!

451
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,787
Yeah, well, you have
your version. I have mine.

452
00:25:50,954 --> 00:25:53,008
We'll see which one
uncle Carlos believes.

453
00:25:54,548 --> 00:25:57,098
Okay, Ana, I'm gonna
tell you something.

454
00:25:59,569 --> 00:26:00,769
Ten years ago,

455
00:26:01,446 --> 00:26:03,004
John Rowland and I...

456
00:26:04,644 --> 00:26:05,844
had an affair.

457
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:08,859
Your uncle Carlos knows about it.

458
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,859
A lot of people got hurt.

459
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,270
But we survived it.

460
00:26:15,316 --> 00:26:17,466
I have no more feelings for John.

461
00:26:18,381 --> 00:26:21,329
But today I found out
he still has feelings for me.

462
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,376
I saw you staring
at this the other day.

463
00:26:29,038 --> 00:26:30,938
I didn't understand it then.

464
00:26:32,888 --> 00:26:33,924
Now I do.

465
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,721
I was staring at a memory. Yes.

466
00:26:47,443 --> 00:26:49,378
And sometimes when I'm
having a rough day,

467
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:51,735
I think about what might have been.

468
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:55,911
But trust me, I would never go back.

469
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,224
Look, Ana, I love your uncle Carlos,
and we have a wonderful life together.

470
00:27:07,652 --> 00:27:10,652
Please, do not do anything
that's gonna hurt him.

471
00:27:17,798 --> 00:27:19,094
Finally got home early.

472
00:27:23,443 --> 00:27:24,643
So what's new?

473
00:27:26,066 --> 00:27:28,271
I was just telling aunt Gaby...

474
00:27:31,421 --> 00:27:33,171
that I wanna quit my job.

475
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:41,366
Anyway, I have homework.

476
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:50,418
- I found this on my bed.
- You like it?

477
00:27:51,673 --> 00:27:52,920
What's the occasion?

478
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,298
The party. I want you to look good.

479
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:57,383
You didn't have to do that.

480
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:02,051
Why not? I wanted to buy
something nice for my son.

481
00:28:02,418 --> 00:28:05,631
Besides, it made me feel less guilty
about buying this...

482
00:28:05,798 --> 00:28:07,685
for me. Cute, huh?

483
00:28:09,103 --> 00:28:10,953
Wait till you see it on me.

484
00:28:22,165 --> 00:28:24,452
Are you ever gonna get
that thing taken care of?

485
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,953
What, the scar?

486
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:29,699
I don't even see it anymore.

487
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:32,919
They can get rid of those things
these days, mom.

488
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:35,880
- Yeah, but that costs money.
- So?

489
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,424
We have to be careful
about money. You know that.

490
00:28:39,156 --> 00:28:42,928
I don't see dad being careful.
He bought a new set of golf clubs.

491
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,430
Listen to me.

492
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,516
After the explosion,
I was in bad shape.

493
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:51,646
You father took
real good care of me.

494
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:53,481
He hung in there.

495
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,182
He's a good man.
Don't you forget that.

496
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:05,353
One day, I'm gonna make
= a lot of money,

497
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,370
and we're gonna get that scar fixed.

498
00:29:08,221 --> 00:29:09,221
Honey.

499
00:29:11,497 --> 00:29:15,147
And don't worry. Whatever happens,
I'm gonna take care of you.

500
00:29:25,507 --> 00:29:27,807
Check out the dress. It's fantastic.

501
00:29:28,268 --> 00:29:30,477
- What'd it cost?
- My dignity.

502
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:34,188
Worth every penny.
Aren't you going to check your jacket?

503
00:29:34,587 --> 00:29:36,608
Well, it's a little chilly in here.

504
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,417
It's not chilly.

505
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:42,364
And even if it was, that's more
of a reason to lose the jacket.

506
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:46,368
Come on. It's just for one night.

507
00:29:47,365 --> 00:29:48,411
Fine.

508
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:52,749
I will check this for you.
Go meet the guys.

509
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:17,941
And there he is now.
I was just telling these guys...

510
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,025
Could I talk to you for a sec, dad?

511
00:30:26,881 --> 00:30:28,159
What are you doing?

512
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:32,198
What, I can't talk to people?

513
00:30:32,365 --> 00:30:35,178
A lot of people are here but
you pick a couple 20-year-old girls?

514
00:30:35,345 --> 00:30:38,085
Come on. I'm saying hello
to a couple of your friends.

515
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:39,504
Yeah, well, don't.

516
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:43,566
I've been gettin' this vibe
from you for a while now,

517
00:30:43,733 --> 00:30:46,845
- and I don't think I deserve it.
- I think you do.

518
00:30:48,065 --> 00:30:49,430
You do? Why is that?

519
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:52,504
Because I know.

520
00:30:54,722 --> 00:30:56,172
You know what, son?

521
00:31:01,406 --> 00:31:03,695
Jeez, Nick! What the hell?!

522
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,779
What do you gotta crash
every party in the world?

523
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:10,702
I bet you want him the hell out of here.
I'm on it. Have fun, baby. Come on.

524
00:31:21,244 --> 00:31:22,494
Hi, sweetheart.

525
00:31:23,747 --> 00:31:25,008
Hooker's home.

526
00:31:25,941 --> 00:31:27,385
How did it go?

527
00:31:27,703 --> 00:31:28,845
It was...

528
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:30,241
bizarre.

529
00:31:30,526 --> 00:31:33,476
From the moment I walked in
with the girls here,

530
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,226
I got smiles,

531
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,148
winks. Men pulled out my chair.

532
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:41,386
The busboy filled my water glass
every two minutes.

533
00:31:41,553 --> 00:31:44,222
And the Bertollini brothers,
who seem to think our proposal

534
00:31:44,389 --> 00:31:46,922
was written on my cleavage,
were putty in my hands.

535
00:31:47,710 --> 00:31:50,533
- They signed the deal on the spot!
- That's great!

536
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,083
Congratulations.

537
00:31:55,475 --> 00:31:58,249
So why are men so obsessed
with these things?

538
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:01,360
I don't know what to say, honey.

539
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:04,127
I mean, some guys...
are just breast men.

540
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:05,923
"Some guys," huh?

541
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:09,520
Me? I appreciate all
aspects of the female...

542
00:32:09,687 --> 00:32:11,537
I'm up here, Tom.
Come on.

543
00:32:12,029 --> 00:32:15,642
Come on, I've seen pictures of
your old girlfriends. Just admit it.

544
00:32:16,172 --> 00:32:19,395
Okay. My name it Tom Scavo,
and I like big breasts.

545
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:21,605
But you married me.

546
00:32:22,706 --> 00:32:25,401
Man, I stepped right
into that one, didn't I?

547
00:32:25,651 --> 00:32:28,821
So let me ask you. You ever
feel like you compromised?

548
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:35,453
Okay, I'm giving you
one chance to start over.

549
00:32:37,479 --> 00:32:40,039
I need you to not be perfect.

550
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:41,833
Why?

551
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:44,212
Because I'm not perfect.

552
00:32:46,742 --> 00:32:49,091
I'm not... rich.

553
00:32:49,979 --> 00:32:51,379
I'm not brilliant.

554
00:32:52,031 --> 00:32:54,471
I'm not movie star handsome.

555
00:32:55,358 --> 00:32:57,964
If you didn't have this one flaw,

556
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,770
I would spend
every moment of every day

557
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,439
wondering,
what the heck is she doing with me?

558
00:33:06,968 --> 00:33:08,718
You may not be brilliant,

559
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:13,408
but you can tiptoe through a minefield
better than anyone I know.

560
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:15,905
Well done.

561
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:26,337
I tried to wait up,
but today was just too much.

562
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,788
What happened?

563
00:33:27,955 --> 00:33:30,216
Well, the repairman
finally showed up, but

564
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:32,743
he didn't have the
right part so he left again.

565
00:33:33,508 --> 00:33:37,308
Then Celia hid my car keys
so I couldn't take her to the dentist.

566
00:33:37,475 --> 00:33:39,267
Then she forgot where she put them.

567
00:33:40,449 --> 00:33:43,206
I told them both they'd be sorry
when their father got home,

568
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:45,423
except you didn't... until now.

569
00:33:45,887 --> 00:33:47,187
I'm sorry, Gaby.

570
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,527
It's okay.

571
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,070
It's kind of funny
when you think about it.

572
00:33:55,636 --> 00:33:56,636
What?

573
00:33:58,996 --> 00:33:59,996
My life.

574
00:34:01,603 --> 00:34:03,708
It just seems so small sometimes.

575
00:34:06,557 --> 00:34:08,527
I spend my days thinking about

576
00:34:08,694 --> 00:34:09,794
detergent...

577
00:34:10,585 --> 00:34:11,885
and groceries...

578
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:15,788
or how I'm gonna get the spot
out of the upholstery.

579
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,076
It's not at all the life
I thought I'd choose for myself.

580
00:34:21,944 --> 00:34:23,144
But some days,

581
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,978
I look up,

582
00:34:27,805 --> 00:34:29,505
and I realize I'm happy.

583
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:36,408
I'm honest to God
happy with my life.

584
00:34:39,951 --> 00:34:42,329
Anyway, I just thought
you might like to know that.

585
00:34:55,371 --> 00:34:57,121
Can I help you with that?

586
00:35:00,152 --> 00:35:03,702
- You're supposed to be on sick leave.
- I'm better. Really.

587
00:35:04,153 --> 00:35:05,395
Now what can I do?

588
00:35:06,475 --> 00:35:08,075
I don't want to fight.

589
00:35:09,637 --> 00:35:12,616
Neither do I. I've lost
so much these past few weeks.

590
00:35:12,783 --> 00:35:14,612
My job and your friendship, it's...

591
00:35:16,198 --> 00:35:18,658
it's all I have left
and I can't lose those.

592
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,410
Honey.

593
00:35:24,699 --> 00:35:25,699
So...

594
00:35:26,411 --> 00:35:28,668
- are we friends again?
- Of course.

595
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,003
I've just been worried
about you, that's all.

596
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:34,841
But if you say you're better,
then... I believe you.

597
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:38,761
Good, because I really, really am.

598
00:35:42,038 --> 00:35:43,702
What the hell is that?

599
00:35:44,539 --> 00:35:47,603
- That's the cake.
- No, that's my cake.

600
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,732
Yes. The bride saw your
design and just loved it.

601
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,906
No, it's my cake...

602
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:56,653
the one I designed for my wedding...
mine and Mike's.

603
00:35:58,436 --> 00:36:01,033
Well, aren't you glad we
found a good use for it?

604
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:04,514
I watched another bride
marry my fiancé.

605
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:08,290
I am not going to watch
another bride eat my cake.

606
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:10,918
Well, no one says
you have to watch, dear.

607
00:36:12,471 --> 00:36:16,120
I know you're upset but don't you dare
take it out on that cake!

608
00:36:16,383 --> 00:36:19,035
It's mine. And if I can't have it,

609
00:36:19,202 --> 00:36:20,302
nobody will.

610
00:36:21,045 --> 00:36:23,263
Don't you touch that cake!

611
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:27,628
Somebody help!

612
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:31,418
Stop that woman!

613
00:36:32,046 --> 00:36:33,046
It's mine!

614
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,945
... to be my lawfully wedded
wife and one true love.

615
00:36:39,151 --> 00:36:41,809
I promise to cherish,
honor and protect you,

616
00:36:41,976 --> 00:36:44,744
and to love you more each day
than I did the day before.

617
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,844
You may now kiss the bride.

618
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:55,003
Good to see you out of bed.

619
00:36:57,869 --> 00:36:59,383
I'm sorry about yesterday.

620
00:37:00,883 --> 00:37:04,180
So... have you remembered
anything else about the attack?

621
00:37:05,036 --> 00:37:06,057
Nothing.

622
00:37:11,006 --> 00:37:13,793
You know, everybody wants
to see the guy who did this

623
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:17,710
off the streets, but the police
don't have much to go on. So...

624
00:37:18,118 --> 00:37:20,068
if they could talk to this...

625
00:37:21,198 --> 00:37:23,199
man that you were seeing...

626
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:26,816
Maybe they could
cross him off the list.

627
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,534
He didn't do it.

628
00:37:29,414 --> 00:37:31,764
And I'm not seeing him anymore,
okay?

629
00:37:32,481 --> 00:37:34,668
- I broke it off.
- You broke it off?

630
00:37:36,253 --> 00:37:39,881
Well, that's a motive right there.
At least let them question him.

631
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,594
If he's innocent,
he has nothing to lose.

632
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,790
Except for his family
when they find out.

633
00:37:48,855 --> 00:37:50,976
So now you're concerned
about his family.

634
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,434
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

635
00:37:53,601 --> 00:37:56,315
For God sake, what were you
thinking, dating a married man?

636
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:05,741
Don't do this.

637
00:38:06,644 --> 00:38:08,787
I am your mother. I love you.

638
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:12,265
I have spent
the last five days sitting there,

639
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:14,696
not sleeping, not eating.

640
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,919
Don't shut me out.

641
00:38:23,116 --> 00:38:24,266
I was lonely.

642
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:26,018
Okay?

643
00:38:26,927 --> 00:38:27,929
He was nice.

644
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:32,685
It just happened.

645
00:38:35,028 --> 00:38:36,328
I don't see how.

646
00:38:37,216 --> 00:38:38,899
This is not something you would do.

647
00:38:41,292 --> 00:38:42,642
Well, guess what?

648
00:38:43,677 --> 00:38:45,614
I'm not perfect anymore.

649
00:38:46,984 --> 00:38:48,993
That perfect daughter you remember

650
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,233
who was always there
when you needed her,

651
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,200
who held everything together
when you were falling apart?

652
00:38:54,367 --> 00:38:57,460
She's grown up, and she's
going to make mistakes.

653
00:39:00,178 --> 00:39:01,858
You wanna make mistakes? Fine.

654
00:39:02,025 --> 00:39:04,473
Dye your hair,
drop out of school. I don't care.

655
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,470
I never expected you to be perfect,

656
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:10,431
but I didn't raise you
to do something this stupid.

657
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:15,809
You know what
an affair like this can do.

658
00:39:16,843 --> 00:39:18,393
You saw it firsthand.

659
00:39:27,908 --> 00:39:28,908
Morning.

660
00:39:30,784 --> 00:39:32,407
Where do you think you're going?

661
00:39:32,574 --> 00:39:36,340
To the test kitchen. We need to start
prep on the Berman bar mitzvah.

662
00:39:36,783 --> 00:39:39,880
Yesterday, you nearly destroyed
my company's reputation.

663
00:39:40,047 --> 00:39:43,687
- Today you're worried about prep work?
- I don't want to talk about yesterday.

664
00:39:43,854 --> 00:39:46,634
- It won't happen again.
- That's right, because you're fired.

665
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:52,098
I'm sorry, but I see no other way
to get you realize how serious this is.

666
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:56,227
You have got to give up this obsession
with Mike before it ruins your life.

667
00:39:57,419 --> 00:40:00,773
I need to work. It's all
that's keeping me going.

668
00:40:01,983 --> 00:40:05,903
You need help, counseling.
I'm telling you this as your friend.

669
00:40:08,796 --> 00:40:10,031
You are not my friend.

670
00:40:10,857 --> 00:40:11,857
Yes, I am.

671
00:40:12,516 --> 00:40:14,966
That's why I'm taking
such a firm hand.

672
00:40:16,099 --> 00:40:17,956
Your only job now is to get better.

673
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:24,422
I'm gonna need you
to give me your keys.

674
00:40:38,573 --> 00:40:39,936
There you go.

675
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:43,065
A souvenir of our... friendship.

676
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,949
<i>You wouldn't know it to look at her,</i>

677
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:53,074
<i>but the lady next door
is having a nervous breakdown.</i>

678
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,081
<i>You'd never guess by her smile,</i>

679
00:40:57,598 --> 00:41:01,452
<i>but the wife of your uncle
once betrayed his trust.</i>

680
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,795
<i>And that daughter you adore...</i>

681
00:41:06,962 --> 00:41:09,542
<i>well, she's having an affair</i>

682
00:41:09,709 --> 00:41:11,168
<i>with a married man.</i>

683
00:41:17,047 --> 00:41:18,738
<i>The sad truth is,</i>

684
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,411
<i>we don't know
our friends and neighbors</i>

685
00:41:21,578 --> 00:41:24,565
<i>nearly as well as we think we do.</i>

686
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:29,111
<i>Even the people we trust most...</i>
