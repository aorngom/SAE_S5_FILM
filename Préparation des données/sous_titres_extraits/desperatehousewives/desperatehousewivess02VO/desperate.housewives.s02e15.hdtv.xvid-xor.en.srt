00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,050
previously on "Desperate Housewives"

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:03,330
why don't I just marry you?

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,080
I've gota fantastic health plan.

4
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:06,320
You'd be covered instantly.

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,610
susan got an offer she couldn't afford to refuse.

6
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:12,150
You've had too much to drink.Give me your keys.

7
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,450
Bree rejected a helping hand.

8
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:16,330
I want to have a babywith you.

9
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:19,700
Gaby gave carlos the answer he'd been waiting for.

10
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,320
You're my second a-b negativetoday.

11
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,430
-Oh,who is it?
-That guy.

12
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,920
And zach began to put "a" and "b" together.

13
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:33,260
Susan mayer had always believed

14
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:36,390
the punishment should fit the crime.

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,250
She first came to this conclusion

16
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,950
when she discovered her husband karl
had been unfaithful.

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,360
Since karl had destroyed the love she
had given him...

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,120
Susan felt it was appropriate

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,710
she destroy the things he loved in return...

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:03,450
one by one.

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,770
but now,three years after their divorce,

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,900
susan was reunited with karl once again...

23
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,190
susan,

24
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,030
are you listening to me?

25
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,830
As partners in a crime of their own.

26
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:18,520
This is insurance fraud.
We could both go to jail.

27
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,440
Now we can't tell anyone
we're getting married.

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,190
I know.I was listening to you.

29
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,810
Now the prenup'sall set.

30
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,390
You can sign itat the courthouse.

31
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,690
11:30,wednesday morning.Right?

32
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:29,960
Right. And your surgery'sstill
on for thursday?

33
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,680
Yep.

34
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,960
Good. The insurance kicks inthe
minute we say "I do."

35
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,580
You're set to go.

36
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,500
I know no one's asking me,but

37
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,760
I think this whole thing
is a tragic mistake,

38
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,640
and I just don't have it in meto
survive another ugly divorce.

39
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,650
Don't worry,honey.This time,
it is strictly a business arrangement.

40
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,250
It better be,

41
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,660
'cause if I see so muchas one lingering gaze
between the two of you,

42
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,740
I swear I'll go
to the insurance companyand turn you in.

43
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,850
So we shouldn't expecta wedding gift,huh?

44
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,580
Oh,can you grab meyour wedding ring?

45
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,980
I wanna get it cleanedbefore the ceremony.

46
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,920
is thatreally necessary?

47
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,670
I mean,do we have to dothe whole ring thing?

48
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,880
Of course we do.It's gotta look believable.

49
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,660
Yeah,okay.Well,I'll just

50
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:13,370
grab somethingout of my jewelry box.

51
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,880
Susan,that ringwas my grandmother'S.

52
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,770
One day it's gonna be julie'S.

53
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,100
Where is it?

54
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,640
I don't know...

55
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,080
exactly.

56
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,210
That was a family heirloom.
I trusted you with it.

57
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,670
Well,I trusted you not tocheat
on me and break my heart.

58
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,110
Oh,my god. Oh,my god.

59
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,330
What--what did you do with it?

60
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:35,040
I threw it out my car windowsomewhere on route 7.

61
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,300
What?! When?

62
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,960
The nightyou abandoned me.

63
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,880
Suz--

64
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,060
karl,you are so not allowed
to get angry.

65
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,030
I mean,I might've been the oneto
throw away the wedding ring,

66
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,150
but you threw awaythe whole marriage.

67
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,450
There was plenty of bad
behaviorthat went on back then,

68
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,520
so just get offyour high horse.

69
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,300
We're on the same page now,
so we shouldjust focus on that.

70
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:06,080
yes,susan mayer believed the punishment
should fit the crime.

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,120
Karl,I thinkthere might be snakes in here.

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,840
We're not leaving hereuntil you find that ring.

73
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,130
But for that matter,so did karl.

74
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,160
so did karl.

78
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,450
it was a tradition
at leonardo's bar and grill,

79
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:35,400
an hour before closing time,

80
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,480
a waiter would sing a selection
of ridiculously depressing italian arias.

81
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,830
It was also a tradition that the only
customers who would actually listen

82
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,980
were the ones already depressed
to begin with.

83
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:56,340
tony?

84
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,280
Do you have to rush off?

85
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,730
I thought maybe we could
just chat for a minute.

86
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,950
So I haven't seen you
in a while.

87
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,960
Well,I didn't wanna come here
because I was afraid

88
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,690
it would drudge up memories
of my husband.

89
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,450
You know,
this was our place.

90
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,530
Rex passed away recently.

91
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,520
He was,um,murdered

92
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,320
by our pharmacist.

93
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,200
I hope you changed
pharmacists.

94
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,790
I didn't have to.
He committed suicide.

95
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,920
Look,you've had
a little too much wine tonight.

96
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,390
How about
I call you a cab?

97
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,740
Oh,no,no,no,no.
I'm okay.

98
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,520
Your car would be safe
in our lot,

99
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,360
and you can pick it up
tomorrow.

100
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,070
Please.

101
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,780
Well,okay.

102
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,640
Tony?

103
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,860
How many more arias
is he gonna sing?

104
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,150
Five.

105
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,630
Oh. In that case,

106
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,900
why don't you bring me another bottle
of the pinot grigio?

107
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,040
and please hurry.

108
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,790
bree?

109
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,100
Bree.

110
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,850
You okay?

111
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:01,550
yes?

112
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,750
Hi. Uh,

113
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,320
did you know your mother
is asleep on the lawn?

114
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,960
Yeah,well,you don't seem
terribly shocked.

115
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:16,710
Oh,it's,um...

116
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,150
it's just,mom drinks,

117
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,690
and sometimes she sleeps it off
in the weirdest places.

118
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:23,670
Can I help you with her?

119
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,920
No. No,it's okay.

120
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,230
I,uh,I know how
to take care of her.

121
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,830
Well,good luck
to you then.

122
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,590
I wanna play "chopsticks."

123
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,330
-Me too.
-You okay?

124
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,220
I'm coming!

125
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,650
-hi.
-Hi.

126
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,870
Your kids--they have any allergies
I should know about?

127
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:04,490
Uh,not that I know of. Why?

128
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,250
'Cause I'm watching them.

129
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,610
Tom called,said you both got pulled
into work for the weekend,

130
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:11,170
asked me to baby-sit.

131
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,190
Really?

132
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,490
I thought it'd be nice
if I gave 'em back to you alive.

133
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,180
oh,hey,mrs. Mccluskey.

134
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,200
-Sorry,I forgot to tell you.
-Hi.

135
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,180
Oh,that's okay. Um...

136
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,040
would you excuse me just
for a second? I have A...

137
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,330
thing.

138
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,570
-Sure.
-Thanks.

139
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:28,330
Follow me.

140
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,760
You're part of the thing.

141
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:37,530
A million teenagersin this neighborhood,
and you hire mccluskey?

142
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:38,620
What's the big deal?

143
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:40,750
Well,for starters,she's ancient!

144
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,350
shh!This is a thin door!

145
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,290
It was not that long agothat
she keeled over in her front yard.

146
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,400
A day withour kids will finish the job.

147
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,970
It's only for a few hours.

148
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,810
Plus,parker's on a play datewith the
farrells,so it's justthe twins and penny.

149
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,140
Just the twins and penny?

150
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,820
Okay,that was stupid.

151
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,610
Let me try that another way.

152
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,680
We have to be at workin one hour.

153
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,130
There's no day careon the weekends,

154
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,130
so you cut mccluskey loose,we're stuck.

155
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,750
We will find someone--

156
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,440
someone who doesn't rememberwhat
they were doing the day lincoln was shot.

157
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:15,290
Fine.

158
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,860
Let's go break the news.

159
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,720
My wife has somethingto tell you.

160
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,880
So here's the deal.

161
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,970
Um,there wasa little miscommunication,
and as it turns out,

162
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:29,350
we don't need ya.

163
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:31,020
Okay.

164
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,960
Fine.I'll just go back home.

165
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,620
Okay. Sorry.

166
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,010
By the way,

167
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,890
your husband was right.

168
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,870
It's a thin door.

169
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,440
Carlos,what are you doing?

170
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:09,500
Hello,gabriela.

171
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,350
Oh.

172
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,650
Hi,mom.

173
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:17,710
I just told carlosI just had to take a shower.

174
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,260
The man next to me on the
planeweighed 300 pounds,

175
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,770
and he sweated all over me.

176
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,830
Ugh,it was so gross.

177
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,680
No,I'm just surprisedyou're here.

178
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,190
It's valentine's day.

179
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:30,160
Don't you and mr. Hedge fundhave plans?

180
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,870
I know carlos and I do.

181
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,720
No,I left charles.

182
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,250
What?

183
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,180
He was worth,like,$6 million.

184
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,020
Money is not everything,gabriela.

185
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,700
For some people,
but we're talkingabout you now,mother.

186
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:47,120
You know,I can't believe this.
I mean,I just went througha terrible breakup,

187
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,750
and the least you could dois pretend to care.

188
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:53,040
Well,of course we feel awfulabout it,
don't we,gabrielle?

189
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,400
Yeah,we're justsick about it.

190
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,560
Well,don't worry about me.

191
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,170
I'll be okay.

192
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,020
In fact,

193
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:05,980
I bought myselfa little gift
to take my mindoff my problems.

194
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,870
Really?What did you buy?

195
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,680
new boobs!

196
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,610
No peeking,carlos.

197
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,410
Okay,mom,put these away!

198
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,800
My plastic surgeongave me a great deal.

199
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,550
Aren't they fun?

200
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:19,960
bye,carlos.

201
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,740
What?I think she's charming.

202
00:10:27,430 --> 00:10:29,640
Okay,you can thinkshe's charming.

203
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,690
But don't forget for one
secondthat she is a monster.

204
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,100
did you get the gum outfrom
under the diamond?

205
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,260
Mostly.

206
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:42,360
Morning.

207
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,670
Hi!Happy valentine's day.

208
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:48,800
Dr. Ron,did you spend the night?

209
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,020
Well,uh,yeah,I gotkinda tired after the movie,
so I asked--

210
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,500
it's okay. She knowsthat
you make house calls.

211
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,400
Oh. Um,so listen,I've got surgery till 6.

212
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,350
I'll get dressed and
I'll pickyou up at about 7.

213
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:01,240
We have reservations
at chez naomi.

214
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,900
Great! I'll havea light lunch.

215
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:06,250
And also,dr. Cunningham'sschedule opened up,
so if you'd like,

216
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,040
we can move upyour surgery to wednesday.

217
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,870
Oh,I have a wedding
that day.

218
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,390
On a wednesday?

219
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,770
yeah.

220
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:17,270
wednesdays are becomingvery
popular with brides.

221
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,340
It's like the new saturday.

222
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,830
Okay.

223
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:23,300
Well...

224
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,500
I'll see ya tonight.

225
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,210
Bye.

226
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,370
Your mother isa rotten,sneaky person.

227
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,350
Look,

228
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,600
I'm not too crazy aboutthis
whole fake marriage thing,but

229
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,220
if you don't havethat operation,
you could die.

230
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,650
So don't be so hardon yourself.

231
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,870
You are a good person.

232
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,410
Thanks,hon.That really helps.

233
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,380
Okay,now I want youto go over
and slip this ringto your father.

234
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,260
And just so you know,if edie catches you,

235
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,970
I'm expecting youto swallow it.

236
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:02,560
How's the hangover?

237
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:05,560
I do not have a hangover,andrew,

238
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,870
because I was not drunk.

239
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,780
Then,uh...

240
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,770
how abouta little hair of the dog?

241
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,100
It'll perk you right up.

242
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,660
Look,for the record,

243
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:21,160
I had an allergic reactionto
my antihistamine medication,

244
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,200
so I would appreciatejust
a little bit of sympathy.

245
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,970
Why can't you just drink alonein
your room like tammy's mom?

246
00:12:27,290 --> 00:12:29,320
For god sakes,it was an honest mistake.

247
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,580
I thought I could have
just a little bit of winewith dinner,

248
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,610
but,apparently,my body couldn't handle it.

249
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,970
Fine!

250
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,850
If it makes everybody happy,

251
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,230
I will just suffer through
my sneezing fitsand my hives on my own.

252
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:49,660
there. Is that better?

253
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,470
So basicallyyou would rather drink
than to not haveallergies?

254
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,610
hi. Is now a bad time?I could really use a favor.

255
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,740
She was beautiful,wasn't she?

256
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:15,130
Yeah.

257
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:18,920
Come on,sit down.Your breakfast is getting cold.

258
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,950
Was my real motherbeautiful?

259
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,900
Well,she was,uh,

260
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:36,150
attractive,as I recall.

261
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,500
Do I look like her?

262
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,510
I don't know.I-I only met her once.

263
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,250
Well,'cause ifI don't look like her,then

264
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,370
I might look likemy real dad.

265
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm getting real tiredof your morbid fascination

266
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:57,060
with two strangers who didn'tlove
you enough to keep you.

267
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,430
So,please,stop asking about them.

268
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,050
It's only natural that I'd wannatalk
about my birth parents.

269
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,120
Well,

270
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,540
it may be natural,

271
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,880
but it certainlyisn't polite.

272
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,210
and onceyour daughter was dead,they

273
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:20,180
had to get ridof her somehow.

274
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,540
That's wherethe toy chest came in.

275
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,800
Flash forward 15 years,

276
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,020
the chest washes upon the shore of rockwater lake.

277
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:30,850
Any forensic evidenceis long gone,

278
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:32,960
and the youngsget away with murder.

279
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,330
Now,of course,the wife,

280
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,140
mary alice,is already dead,but...

281
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,490
paul young'sa different matter.

282
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,540
If you'd like meto deal with him,

283
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,350
just say the word.

284
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,540
Delfino's bringingmy grandson here.

285
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:54,430
I wannaget the kid something.

286
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,160
You know anythingabout those mp3 things?

287
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,350
Yeah,they're real nice.

288
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,370
I'd go with that.

289
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,290
Ah,he's probablygot one already.

290
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,860
Paul younghas had 16 years
to get my grandkidanything he wants.

291
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,100
Do me a favor,will ya?

292
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,240
Yeah.

293
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,120
See to it that

294
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:24,130
paul young
has a toy chestof his very own.

295
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:35,820
-karl!
-yeah?

296
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:38,260
This placeis a freakin' pigsty.

297
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,670
Would you get down hereand help me?

298
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:44,020
All right,hold on,it's almost halftime.

299
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,990
By the way,I made dinner reservations
at chez naomi tonight,if that's okay.

300
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:51,740
it's gotta be betterthan that rathole
you took me toon new year'S.

301
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,830
And don't even think
of getting me carnations again.

302
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,220
That crap might have flownfor mayer.

303
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,240
I actually have taste.

304
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,190
Come on! Move it!

305
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,000
all right,I'm coming.

306
00:16:13,570 --> 00:16:14,380
No! No,no,no.

307
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,640
Sit and watch the game.
I was just giving youa hard time.

308
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,120
You'd had a tough week.

309
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,770
Boys...

310
00:16:23,770 --> 00:16:25,820
can you just keep it downjust a little bit?

311
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,420
Because I have a very...

312
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,700
special typeof grown-up headache.

313
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,810
We need to see mommy and daddy.

314
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,550
We wanna play 'em our song.

315
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,250
Honey,you can'T.They're at work.

316
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,090
Well,can we play itfor you?

317
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,430
Sure.

318
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:47,720
just--just a moment,okay?

319
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,720
All right,boys,let's have it.

320
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:06,610
When I heard that you twowanted
to try for another child,

321
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:07,990
I was delighted.

322
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:10,290
But I had some causefor concern.

323
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,310
Gabrielle,you sufferedsome extensive injuries

324
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,750
during your falllast month,and

325
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:18,470
the test confirmedthere are complications.

326
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,440
You can't have kids?

327
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,520
Well,the doctor's not100% positive,but

328
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,860
it's very,very iffy.

329
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,470
Carlos,I am so sorry.

330
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,590
I know how muchyou wanted to be a dad.

331
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,740
Thanks.

332
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,150
Don't be so suicidal.We can always adopt.

333
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:37,270
I wanted to have a childof our own.
You know that.

334
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:39,030
What does it matterwhose D.N.A. It is?

335
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:41,140
The diapers are still gonnasmell
the same regardless.

336
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,400
I'd just prefernot to adopt. Okay?

337
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Fine.

338
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,070
What about surrogacy?

339
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:49,740
I mean,I know it's pricey,
but at least the babywould look like us,

340
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:52,720
and I wouldn't getstretch marks.
It's a win-win.

341
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,880
Great.

342
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,810
So then we havesome stranger off the street
giving birth to our child.

343
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:58,190
Is that what you really want?

344
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,760
What I wantis for you to lighten up.

345
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,480
We don't havea lot of options,
and you're gonna have to pick one.

346
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,240
I-I have a thought. Mm?

347
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,660
Well,it's,uh,a little bit controversial,
but,uh,go with me.

348
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,310
Well,first of all,let me tell you,

349
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,750
that I am in the best shapeof my life.

350
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,870
-So?
-So...

351
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:19,370
what if I wasyour surrogate?

352
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,380
Yeah,I know. I knowit might
sound a little crazy,

353
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,920
but I am the only onein the world

354
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,280
that you can trustto put
the baby's needs first.

355
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,720
You know,I'll exercise more,I'll eat better--

356
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,280
mother,no!

357
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,390
Why?

358
00:18:35,390 --> 00:18:38,070
Off the top of my head,you're on medicare?

359
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,470
I am only fifty... one.

360
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,010
You know,and there's
this womanin england last year.

361
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:47,840
She was 63 years old,and she gave birth
to her own grandchild.

362
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,470
Look,I don't care if
she shottriplets out of her ass.

363
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:52,030
It's not gonna happen.

364
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,940
Can you believe this?

365
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,650
How'd thatengland baby turn out?

366
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,280
I mean,it didn't have,like,
a big head or anything,did it?

367
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,630
Carlos,you are notseriously considering this.

368
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,960
Well,think about it,gaby.

369
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,210
This way,the surrogate wouldn'tbe
some impersonal incubator.

370
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,910
There'd be a family tie.

371
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,370
I have a migraine.

372
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:15,820
I'm gonna go lay down upstairs.

373
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,050
Then when I get up,

374
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:20,330
I hope we can all talk aboutthis
like rational human beings.

375
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:24,710
Carlitos,don't worry.

376
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:28,210
Just give her time.

377
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,910
She'll come around.

378
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,850
boys?

379
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:18,850
Boys?

380
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,930
Okay,we're done playinghide-and-seek!

381
00:20:25,670 --> 00:20:27,050
Boys?!

382
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,910
Porter! Preston!

383
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,660
This isn't funny!

384
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,020
Mrs. Mccluskey,hi.

385
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,770
Have you seenthe scavo boys?

386
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:46,540
No,can't saythat I have. Why?

387
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,230
I have somethingto tell them.

388
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,410
Have they signedthe contract?

389
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:59,690
'Cause if not,somebody should call bednark
and tell them to adjust the language.

390
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,040
oh. I'm sorry. Hang on.Hello?

391
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,460
lynette scavo?

392
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,430
Yes.

393
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,820
I believe I have somethingthat belongs to you.

394
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,760
hi. Excuse me.Hi. You called
and you said my kids are here?

395
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,230
hi,mommy!

396
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:20,310
-Oh,my god!
-Dad!

397
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:23,510
Just what were you thinking,
taking off like that?

398
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:26,500
honey,I was so worried about you.

399
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,870
get your stuff.Get your stuff right over here.

400
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,810
Thank you.

401
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,930
-Thank you so much.
-Stay right here.

402
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,660
I'm just glad I found 'emand
not some weirdo freak.

403
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:37,800
Oh,yes.Oh,yeah,me too. Thank you.

404
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,240
Because there are all sortsof
crazy people out there--

405
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,050
drunks,perverts,molesters.

406
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,940
Yes! Yeah,no,I know.

407
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:47,510
No! You got really lucky.

408
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:51,290
I mean,a different personmight
have called the cops or child welfare.

409
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,720
Well,uh,okay,I know how this looks,
but I have to tell you,

410
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,350
I left them witha very reliable baby-sitter.

411
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,320
Oh,yeah.You picked a real winner.

412
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:05,550
Are you judging me?Because if you are,

413
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,070
-you couldn't say anything
-lynette,lynette!

414
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,880
-What?!
-Let it go.

415
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,150
The kids walkedfor 3 miles to get here.
We don't havea leg to stand on.

416
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,580
Well,thank you so much!

417
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,500
here we go.

418
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:26,350
Hey...I don't know about you,

419
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:28,880
but I am tired of allthe tension around here,

420
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,380
so I was thinking we couldgo shopping,
have some fun.

421
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:35,460
Then maybe later we can talkabout
the surrogacy thing,

422
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,640
see if we canmake it work.

423
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,390
Oh,gabriela!

424
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,600
Oh,you'll see...

425
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:44,000
this is the best thingfor the entire family.

426
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,750
So where's the boutique?

427
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,020
Oh,it's inthe hotel lobby.

428
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,140
So go ahead,I'm right behind ya.

429
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,470
Okay.

430
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,080
what are you doing?

431
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,500
I'm going home.

432
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,940
What?

433
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,590
I thoughtwe were gonna talk about
how the surrogacy will work.

434
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,140
Here's how it's gonna work--

435
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,080
you're gonna check yourself
into the hotel,

436
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,980
and then tomorrow,you're gonna
plant yourchildbearing hips on a plane,

437
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:25,020
and you're gonnaleave our lives forever.

438
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,820
I'm pulling out.Watch your boobs.

439
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,360
come on out.

440
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,890
Oh,thank god! I'm so sorry.

441
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,500
I don't know what happened.I was in the
kitchen cleaning upafter making cookies,and

442
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,540
I looked in the living room,and they were gone.

443
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,720
We tried to tell her we weregoing,
but she was asleep.

444
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,020
You were sleeping?

445
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:03,950
I most certainly was not.

446
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,360
-Yes,you were.
-Okay,all right,

447
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,280
that liejust lost you another week
of tv and video gameprivileges.

448
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,690
That's two. You wannakeep talking and lose more?

449
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,540
Then apologizeto mrs. Van de kamp.

450
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,010
Sorry.

451
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:19,040
All right,go back in.No--no harm done.

452
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,110
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

453
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:30,140
well,if you ask me,it'sa pretty
crappy thing to do.

454
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,490
Did you even slow the car
downbefore you pushed her out?

455
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,100
Okay,first of all,no one asked you.

456
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,970
And the only reason you careabout
my mother is because

457
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,360
of that ridiculous suggestion she offered.

458
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:40,750
I think her offer to be our surrogate
was very generous.

459
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,040
Generous?

460
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,290
Don't you seethe strings attached?

461
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,510
What strings?

462
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:48,890
The only reason she offered up
her dusty wombis because she's screwed.

463
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:50,600
Her latest sugar daddygave her the boot,

464
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,880
so mom needs a place to stayand money.

465
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,920
So trust me,if she carried our child,
we'dbe footing the bill for years.

466
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,220
I think your hatred for heris
clouding your judgment.

467
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:01,800
Maybe,but you don'tknow her like I do.

468
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,620
Okay.

469
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,890
You ran away from home15 years ago.

470
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:13,540
Did you ever thinkto talk to her about the
stuff that happenedbetween you and your stepdad?

471
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,490
It wouldn't have doneany good.

472
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,470
How do you know that?

473
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,490
Because...

474
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,200
she knew exactly what
was going on with alejandro,

475
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,370
and she chose
to look the other way.

476
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,900
But you never even gave hera chance to step up.
You just ran awayfrom home.

477
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,480
Because if I did,then she w--

478
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,850
because...

479
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,170
there was a chanceshe wouldn't
have believed me,and...

480
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:41,570
and thatwould've hurt a lot worse
than anythinghe ever did to me.

481
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,960
She's your mother,and she loves you.

482
00:25:58,370 --> 00:25:59,810
I know it's beena very long time,

483
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,160
but maybe you cantalk to her about it now.

484
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:13,090
I'm getting her luggageback to her,
and that's the bestI can do.

485
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,550
what are you doing here?

486
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:32,260
There's something I needto talk to you about.
It's important.

487
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:34,160
There's nothing for usto talk about.

488
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,120
Shut up and listen.

489
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,980
Dierdre's father,

490
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,600
noah taylor,
somehow found out about zach,

491
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,490
and he wants to meet him.

492
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,120
"Somehow found out"?Like,maybe you told him?

493
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,150
Noah is no friend of mine.

494
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,830
But he's very rich and powerful,
and he's terminal,

495
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,640
and he wants to meethis grandson before he dies.

496
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,790
Absolutely not.

497
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,280
Well,you'll be surprised,but I agree with you.

498
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:02,270
Noah destroyseverything he touches,

499
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:05,000
and the last thingeither of us wants

500
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,580
is for this guyto get his hooks into zach.

501
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,860
What are we supposed to do?

502
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:18,040
You and zach need to vanish.
Just stay out of sight

503
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,390
until naturetakes its course with noah.

504
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:24,530
If we leave,we won't be coming back.

505
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,830
You'll never seeyour boy again.

506
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,710
I know.

507
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:37,420
Well,happy valentine's day,my darling.

508
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,920
Isn't thatyour ex-husband?

509
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:43,570
Oh,yeah.

510
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:48,650
apparently,they'll let anyone in here.

511
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,080
Hi.

512
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,770
Your chocolate souffléswill be out momentarily.

513
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,480
Oh,we didn'torder souffl?

514
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,230
I orderedas soon as we got here.

515
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,840
It takes an hour to prepare.

516
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,060
Oh,I really can'T.I'm stuffed.

517
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,450
No,no,no,this you'll wanna try.

518
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:04,330
It's their specialty.

519
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,660
I guessI'll have the souffl?

520
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:11,840
Can you excuse mefor a second?

521
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,860
I,um...

522
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,310
I justhave to powder my nose.

523
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,830
I'm sorry to interrupt.

524
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,830
Your makeup is all smudged.Come with me.
I'll fix it.

525
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,580
-What?
-Come on,get up.

526
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,750
Sorry.

527
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,510
My makeup is smudged?

528
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,580
get in here.

529
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,710
I have some news that'sprobably
gonna devastate you.

530
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,150
But I wanted to bethe first one to tell you.

531
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,720
Okay.

532
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,810
Karl is aboutto pop the question.

533
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:48,900
You mean,like,marriage?

534
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,930
Oh,I hope I haven't ruinedyour valentine's day.

535
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,980
-Do you want a tissue?
-No,no. I'm okay.

536
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,570
I-I'm just... surprised.

537
00:28:57,490 --> 00:28:59,470
well,congratulations.

538
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:03,010
what makes you thinkhe's gonna propose?

539
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,900
Well,I,um,

540
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,040
I was looking throughhis briefcase this afternoon,

541
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,700
and I found this ring.

542
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,830
And so tonight he keeps pushingthis
"special dessert" on me,

543
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,160
so obviously,he's hidden the ring inside.

544
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,720
A ring!

545
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,530
what did it look like?

546
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,810
Oh,I don't know.

547
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:23,810
18-karat white gold,10 diamonds,
engraved accents.

548
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,320
I just got a quick peek.

549
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,440
I think I know that ring.

550
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:31,580
That's his grandmother's ring.
It's a family heirloom.

551
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:35,770
And,you know,
he might just be having itcleaned or something.

552
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:39,820
Except for one thing--
lying right next to it...

553
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,220
was a prenup!

554
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,010
Well,karl is a lawyer,and

555
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:52,280
it could just be a prenupfor another client.

556
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:57,440
Boy,jealousy isone ugly thing up close.

557
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,450
Oh,no,edie--

558
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,120
no,you know what?
I'm gonna takethe high road and...

559
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,700
and I'm gonna ignoreyour nastiness.

560
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,540
If you'll excuse me,I'm

561
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:08,650
going back to my table

562
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,720
and getting engaged.

563
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,610
oh,hi. Um,

564
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,560
do you see that man over there?
Dark hair,handsome.

565
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,370
I need you to slip this to
himwithout anybody noticing.

566
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,790
Be careful!She thinks you're about to propose.

567
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:44,380
God,you never stop.

568
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,590
I told you,I'm not divorcing my wife.

569
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:50,780
I'm in this for the sex,
and if you can't accept it,then go to hell.

570
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,320
what the hellare you doing?

571
00:31:04,130 --> 00:31:06,200
Well,I thought you saidthis dessert was special.

572
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,100
When you put itin your mouth and eat it.
What is wrong with you?

573
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,440
Well...

574
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,630
nothing.

575
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,160
Carlos,

576
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,590
what a surprise.Come on in.

577
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,070
I thoughtyou could use your bags.

578
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,870
Oh,yes.The perfect timing.

579
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,510
I just took a shower and
neededsomething to change into.

580
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,310
Here,leave it here.This is fine. Thank you.

581
00:31:33,310 --> 00:31:35,050
Listen,do you have a minute?

582
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:36,720
because I need to talkto you about something.

583
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,020
Hmm,yeah,sure. Sit down.

584
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,200
Talk as I dress.

585
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,150
I'll leave the door openso I can hear.

586
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,710
Look,I was,uh,

587
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,290
I was thinkingabout your surrogacy idea.

588
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,690
And I thinkit could be the answer
to all of our problems.

589
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:55,170
That is,if you're still interested.

590
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,230
Yes! I mean,uh,

591
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,030
I am.

592
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,590
but I-I just think that
gaby will never let it happen.

593
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,030
No,no. No,she canbe convinced.
I know it.

594
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,700
Can you please,uh,
zip me up?

595
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:12,790
My zipper! It's stuck.

596
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:20,590
you did that so fast.

597
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,010
I know someonewho works out.

598
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:26,430
As I was saying,

599
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:29,560
I thinkthe surrogacy idea could work.

600
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:35,380
but you and gaby are
gonnahave to mend some fences.

601
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,230
After such a long time,what is the point?

602
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,260
Lucia,please,hear me out.

603
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,450
There was a lot of stuffthat gaby went through
when she was younger--

604
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:46,380
a lot of stuffthat you don't know about.

605
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,770
And I think that if you wentto her and
asked her about it,

606
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,890
then the two of youcould finally get past it.

607
00:32:50,890 --> 00:32:53,200
What stuff are youtalking about,carlos?

608
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,440
your second husband,alejandro?

609
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,960
When gaby was 15,he assaulted her sexually.

610
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,580
Is that what she told you?

611
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,970
Look,

612
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,690
I know thatit comes as a shock for you
to be hearing it from me--

613
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:14,640
carlos,please,I am aware they had sex.

614
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:18,280
But it was gabrielawho seduced him.

615
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,630
Excuse me?

616
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,470
She was always jealous of me.

617
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:26,750
You don't know how many times I
caught her wearing my shoes,

618
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,240
trying on my jewelry...

619
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,460
and I'd scream at her to
leavemy things alone,but no,

620
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,760
she wanted whatever I had.

621
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,110
Then one night,

622
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:38,470
she set her sights on alejandro.

623
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,100
Believe me,

624
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,230
no one got raped.

625
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:48,140
Lucia,she was only 15 years old.

626
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,950
You know,a lot of menhave left
me over the years,

627
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,470
and I never knew the reason.

628
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:56,940
But when alejandro left,
I knew exactly why it happened.

629
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,840
Gabriela made himfall in love with her.

630
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,200
Oh,it took me so many yearsto forgive her.

631
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,910
-You forgave her?
-But of course.

632
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,700
I couldn't have offeredto carry
her baby unless I had.

633
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,920
karl. Karl!

634
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,820
Come here!

635
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,570
Why didn't you answeryour damn cell phone?

636
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:32,420
I turned it off.What's going on?

637
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,520
Where's edie?

638
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,270
She's upstairs.She's been in a pissy
mood eversince we left the restaurant.

639
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,460
I don't know
what's wrong with her.

640
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:39,920
She found the ringand the prenup
in your briefcase.

641
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,500
She thought you were gonna
pop the question tonight.

642
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,670
-Oh,no.
-Oh,yes.

643
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:48,270
You know,this wholefake marriage thing
was okay when nobodywas getting hurt.

644
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,290
What are we doing? It's a lie!

645
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:53,520
I lost mike over a lie,
and now I'm doingthe same thing to dr. Ron,

646
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,230
and--and look at edie.She was devastated.

647
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,600
I don't think
I can go through with this.

648
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,960
You can'tcall off the wedding.
How are you gonna pay for your surgery?

649
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,740
I don't know.
You know,I'll just...I'll sell the car.

650
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:07,090
Susie,this is your healthwe're talking about.

651
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:07,880
We're getting married.

652
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:08,930
-Karl--
-no.

653
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:11,590
Dr. Ronwould be the first to say
that you're doingthe right thing.

654
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:15,380
I'll figure out some wayto handle edie.

655
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,870
How? How are yougonna handle edie?

656
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,640
That poor woman's dreamsexploded
in her face tonight.

657
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,570
You know,it's not likeyou can just go out and
buy her flowers,and everything will be better.

658
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,920
Then I'll propose to her.

659
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,590
Well,that's a little extreme.

660
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:33,260
Not really. I was probablygonna
do it eventually anyhow.

661
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,600
Obviously we're gonnahave to get a divorce
before I can actuallymarry her.

662
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,670
But,uh... what?

663
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,040
Nothing. I just...

664
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:46,870
I didn't know thatyou loved her like that.

665
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:49,440
She's a great kid.Total package.

666
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,460
What's the matter,susie q?Jealous?

667
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,350
no,of course not.

668
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:01,180
Well,okay,this is good because...

669
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:04,180
you know,if this experience

670
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,060
helped you to realize
your true feelings,then,uh...

671
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,630
then we did somethinggood here.

672
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:13,490
Yeah. I think we have.

673
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,700
Come here.

674
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,710
I can't believeyou thought I was jealous.

675
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:22,290
It's not like I still havefeelings
for you anymore.

676
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:26,100
You're right.I-I was just fooling around.

677
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,580
So? How did it go?

678
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:34,940
Fine. I just dropped offthe luggage and left.

679
00:36:46,190 --> 00:36:47,620
What was that for?

680
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,830
No reason.

681
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,000
Hey,I was thinking...

682
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,530
we should
look into adoption.

683
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,150
Seriously?

684
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:02,330
But I thought you wanteda kid
with your own D.N.A.?

685
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,180
Blood isn't everything.

686
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,600
Hey!

687
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,970
I heard ya lostyour kids yesterday.

688
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,100
Yeah.

689
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:26,900
it was cleared up.It was just a little confusion.

690
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:29,190
Uh,help me out herewith something.

691
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,280
What exactly is ityou look for in a baby-sitter?

692
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:33,710
Excuse me?

693
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,340
Well,I may be ancient,like you say,

694
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:39,140
but I've never gotten drunkand
lost track of three kids.

695
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,150
What?

696
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:43,600
I smelled wineon bree van de kamp
when she was lookingfor your boys.

697
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:45,450
That's ridiculous.Is it?

698
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,070
Yesterday I found her passed outon
her front lawn,drunk as a skunk.

699
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,730
I've known breefor years and years.

700
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:53,580
There's no way she was drinkingwhile
baby-sitting my kids.

701
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,950
So...

702
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,770
just go spread your poison
somewhere else. Okay?

703
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,280
I just thought I'd do youa favor
and let you know,that's all.

704
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,070
Okay,well,thanks.

705
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,060
Hi.

706
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:15,110
You,um,you recovered fromall
of yesterday's excitement?

707
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:18,290
Oh,truthfully,I haven't beenable
to get my mind off it.

708
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,300
What a scare,huh?

709
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,820
Yeah,

710
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:26,750
althoughI-I still can't figure out
how my boysmanaged to sneak past you.

711
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,680
Well,you knowhow boys are at the age.
They're escape artists.

712
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,430
They're like lightning.

713
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,680
It's just,penny...

714
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:38,470
-penny?
-Well,I mean,

715
00:38:38,470 --> 00:38:41,260
I just don't understand how porter
and preston managedto

716
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,630
wrangle her into the stroller and then

717
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:46,870
make it outyour front door
withoutyou even noticing.

718
00:38:54,710 --> 00:38:56,550
I guessif you'd fallen asleep...

719
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,580
it could've happenedlike that,I-I guess.

720
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:03,600
You know,I think,um,
I must have been cleaningthe kitchen,and I-

721
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,290
I justdidn't hear them
because of the noisefrom the dishwasher.

722
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,220
Look,I apologize in advancefor
how this is going to sound,

723
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:14,840
but I have to ask.
It's justgonna eat away at me.

724
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,800
Were you drinkingwhile baby-sitting my kids?

725
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,450
No!

726
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:29,780
you know,I may have had
just the tiniest little bitof chardonnay.

727
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:35,720
Oh,gosh,you got drunk,and you passed out.

728
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,220
Lynette,if I close my eyeseven for a moment,

729
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,750
it's because of theseantihistamines
I've been taking.

730
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,570
Really?Is that why you passed outon your
front lawn yesterday morning?

731
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,180
Now that you're speaking to mein
a fairly accusatory tone,

732
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,940
may I remind you thatI was doing you a favor?

733
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:53,950
You put my kids in danger,
and then you lied about it.

734
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:57,290
Do you not gethow big that is?
Do you have somekind of problem with alcohol?

735
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,510
No! The only problem I haveis with your children.

736
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,480
They're incorrigiblebecause you let them run amok.

737
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,660
And if I hadn'tdrifted off,

738
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,880
they would have waiteduntil I was in the bathroom

739
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,380
or stuck on the phoneor upstairs doing laundry.

740
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,310
On any given day,
how many glasses of winedo you put away?

741
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:21,100
I will not be spoken tolike that.
I just won'T.

742
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:44,340
now and then,we allneed a little help...

743
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,570
so we ask for small favors.

744
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,170
Thanks. I owe you one.

745
00:40:52,170 --> 00:40:57,000
But it's always best to be wary of
those eager to come to our rescue.

746
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,180
Well,go on.Kiss the bride.

747
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,710
because even the smallest of favors...

748
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,660
sure thing,tom.
I'd be happyto baby-sit for you.

749
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,810
My,have you noticedhow clogged
my rain gutters are?

750
00:41:15,810 --> 00:41:17,930
...Carries a price tag.

751
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,280
Yes,everyone has an agenda.

752
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,670
I heard about your operation,aunt inez,

753
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,220
and I'm jumpingon a plane right now
to come and help you out.

754
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,290
No matter what they may tell us.

755
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:31,360
No,I'm happy to,

756
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:35,370
and I'm prepared to stayas long as it takes.

757
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:41,070
And in those rare instances
where there is  no ulterior motive,

758
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:46,330
we're so taken aback
that we may fail to recognize the truth...

759
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,630
Do you still think you don't have a problem?

760
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:05,010
that a loving friend has
just done us an enormous favor.
