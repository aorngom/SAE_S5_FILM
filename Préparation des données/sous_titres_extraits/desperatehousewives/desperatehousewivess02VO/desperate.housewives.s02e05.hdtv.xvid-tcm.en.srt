1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
Previously on "desperate housewives"...

2
00:00:01,870 --> 00:00:03,730
the police dug upyour father today.

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:05,580
They think that somebodywas poisoning him.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,960
Apparently,I'm a suspect.

5
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:09,160
Bree felt threatened by the past.

6
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:11,200
- Get the damn lawyer.
- Are you hitting on me?

7
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:13,780
Gabrielle was threatened by seduction.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:14,580
Do you mean julie?

9
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:16,490
If I come back with you,then I can make it up to her.

10
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,290
You should find your fatherfirst. Let me help.

11
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:21,720
And while some threats...

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,580
Were kept under control...

13
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:29,180
let's get this over with.

14
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,420
Some were left free to return.

15
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:38,230
Since her first day on the job,

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:41,170
it had been clear to lynette scavo

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,890
that her new boss nina was unusually tense.

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,150
To help relieve her tension,

19
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,570
lynette tried giving her boss thoughtful gifts--

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,550
a soothing wave machine...

21
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,870
aromatherapy candles...

22
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:04,970
even meditative chi balls.

23
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,780
But nothing seemed to ease nina's tension.

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,100
"Distilledthe old-fashioned way."

25
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,800
You know,it actually hurts my teeth

26
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,970
to say that out loud.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,080
You folks are going to toddleback to your little holes

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,980
and you are gonna come upwith a decent slogan

29
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,180
or I will can all your assesthe old-fashioned way.

30
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:32,820
Until one day when it occurred to lynette

31
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,440
there was one form of relaxation

32
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:38,270
she had yet to try.

33
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,230
It's a gimlet.You'll love it.

34
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,560
What exactlyis your plan here,

35
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:46,300
to get me all liquored upso I buy the revised pitch?

36
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,930
Don't be ridiculous.

37
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,080
Could we get a trough

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,070
of these,please?

39
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:55,300
I can't remember the last timeI was in a bar.

40
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:57,310
Must have been the last timeI had a boyfriend,

41
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,380
which was...

42
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,430
oh,god,I'm a nun.

43
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,660
So why don't you go outand get in the game?

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,840
Believe it or not,

45
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:11,130
when it comes to meeting men,I am... shy.

46
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,160
Well,I'm not.

47
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,840
So,uh...

48
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,770
what about that guyover there?

49
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:21,150
He's been checking you outsince we walked in.

50
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,510
He's cute.

51
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,750
So go over there.

52
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,620
no.

53
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,030
Oh,for god's sakes.

54
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,430
Where are you going?Lynette,sit--

55
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,600
hey,stretch,

56
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:38,200
see my friend over there?

57
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,760
She thinks you're cute.

58
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,390
Why don't youbuy her a drink?

59
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,360
Hey,everybody. Hi.

60
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:54,060
Oh,it's a beautiful morning,isn't it?

61
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,260
Thank you,sweetie.

62
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,380
Oh,hey,lynette,I readthe new vodka proposal.

63
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,240
Oh,you guys hit itout of the park.

64
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,450
I love that color.

65
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,780
Thanks. Hey,nina.

66
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,700
Yeah?

67
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:10,840
And although it had come about in an unexpected manner...

68
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,820
aren't those the same clothes
you were wearing last nightin the bar?

69
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,780
Yep.

70
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,380
Nina's tension had finally been released...

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,380
the old-fashioned way.

00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,680
Everyone in this world

75
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:10,690
needs someone they can depend upon,

76
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,540
be it a faithful companion,

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,510
trusted confidant...

78
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:19,900
or loyal friend.

79
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,990
For susan mayer,that dependable someone

80
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:26,630
was her book agent lonny moon.

81
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,630
It was lonny

82
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:32,450
who helped susan promote her first children's book.

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,380
It was lonny who rushed susan to the hospital

84
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,780
the night julie was born.

85
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,010
It was lonny who took susan's mind

86
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,760
off her painful divorce

87
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,470
with a fun vacation.

88
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:49,340
Yes,lonny was susan's rock.

89
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,800
Sadly for susan,

90
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:53,620
her rock was about to crumble.

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,350
for those of you just joining us,

92
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,140
we have a new development in the melanie foster case...

93
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,930
lonny,what are you doing here?

94
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,410
It's past noon.

95
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,640
Which means it's nowsocially acceptable

96
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,550
to begin drinking.

97
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,210
I can't believe I let youtalk me into this.

98
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,670
I am so behind in my work.

99
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,210
But I'm glad I came.This is fun.

100
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,390
I've gotta be honest.

101
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:16,310
I had an ulterior motive.

102
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,600
Oh?

103
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,800
I've decided to startmy own agency.

104
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,100
You're leaving muir and hunt?

105
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,850
You helped build that place.

106
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,350
I know,but I just feelit's time.

107
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,990
And now the question is,will you come with me?

108
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:33,090
Well... of course.

109
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:34,830
Okay!

110
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,710
To the future.

111
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:39,780
I'll just call the agency,

112
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,690
and I'll let them knowI'm going with you.

113
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,220
Oh,I don't thinkthat's necessary.

114
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,840
Really?

115
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:49,070
Yeah,I thinkit might be rude not to.

116
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,350
Lonny...

117
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,410
what's going on?

118
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,160
Okay.

119
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:00,590
There's been some bad bloodbetween me and the partners.

120
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,710
Why?

121
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,540
I got into this thingwhere I had to move

122
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:05,780
a little client moneyaround temporarily

123
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:07,330
to cover some expenses.

124
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,150
You had to "move money"?What does that mean?

125
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:14,520
I took a little from here,and I moved it there.

126
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,130
It was no big deal.

127
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,830
Really?

128
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,690
'Cause it sort of soundslike embezzlement.

129
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,440
Why do peoplekeep using that word?!

130
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,780
Who else is usingthat word?

131
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,610
Nobody.

132
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,480
The partnersand their forensic accountant.

133
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,380
Oh,my god.

134
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,060
Lonny,did you "move"some of my money?

135
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,790
Absolutely not.I swear!

136
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:39,300
Susan,don't look at methat way.

137
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,390
I know what I didwas wrong,

138
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,600
and I feel likea complete idiot for doing it,

139
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:47,470
but please,please don't hate me.

140
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,710
Well,I don't hate you.

141
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,690
I couldn't hate you.You're my lonny.

142
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,750
So...

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,610
will you stillcome with me?

144
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,630
You know what?

145
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,470
This is one of those times

146
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,360
when you find outwho your real friends are,

147
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,590
so,yeah.

148
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:13,130
Oh,thank you!Thank you!

149
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:18,000
You are one special lady,susan mayer.

150
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,480
Is that the baby's head?

151
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,890
No,that's his foot.

152
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,030
That looks likea head to me.

153
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,540
Well,that settles it.

154
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,550
When this baby's born,

155
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,780
I'll be in chargeof putting on the socks.

156
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,630
You're glowing today,you know that?

157
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,740
Pregnancy agrees with you.Yeah?

158
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,710
Well,if you don't mindthe hemorrhoids and the nausea,

159
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,430
it's quite the party.

160
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,570
I wonder where david is.He should've been here by now.

161
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,880
So this new lawyer's good?

162
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,480
He's quite the shark.You're gonna love him.

163
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,650
He hasn't lost a casein six years.

164
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,680
He argued in front ofthe state supreme court,

165
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,230
and he made our conjugal visithappen pretty damn fast.

166
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,180
Well,hey,I'm a fan already.

167
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,490
Sorry I'm late.

168
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,550
Oh,david.

169
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,440
Good to see you,gaby.Carlos,I'm david.

170
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:25,110
I don't think so.

171
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,850
What the hellare you doing?

172
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,660
That guy's not gonna bemy lawyer.

173
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,220
Find a new one.

174
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,320
You haven't fileda single charge.

175
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,550
Either determine a homicideor release the body.

176
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,940
We've got a court orderwhich says,

177
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,210
until we're done with it,the corpse is ours.

178
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,040
He is not a corpse.

179
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:46,460
He is a mannamed rex van de kamp.

180
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,600
He was a loving husband,a devoted father

181
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,600
and a successful doctor.

182
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,650
So successful,in fact,that he left me enough money

183
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,130
to sue the city,this precinct

184
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,810
and you two gentlemenpersonally

185
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,750
just for the fun of it.

186
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,930
Mrs. Van de kamp,we don'trespond well to threats,

187
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:05,080
so if I--release the body.

188
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:06,290
What?

189
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,380
The evidence we haveis minimal at best.

190
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,200
Mrs. Van de kampwas gracious enough

191
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,340
to come down hereand take that lie detector test.

192
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,450
I think it's the leastwe can do for her.

193
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:16,080
Thank you.

194
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,950
So,uh,what will happen now?

195
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,330
Obviously,we'll putmr. Van de kamp back

196
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,420
just like we found him.

197
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,940
Yes,and I'm sureyou will bury him

198
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,780
with all the dignityof a dead hamster.

199
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,400
No,I want rex released to me

200
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,250
and I will makeall the arrangements.

201
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:33,890
Fine.

202
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:36,380
And,of course,you'll bepaying all the costs.

203
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:38,420
Of course.

204
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:41,600
Detective barton,

205
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,080
you are clearly a gentleman.

206
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,120
people have gathered at attenborough high school,

207
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,040
where melanie attended...

208
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,760
no,it's fine. I'll pick 'em upon my way home.

209
00:09:56,810 --> 00:09:59,240
Okay,so what do you want?

210
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:02,930
Oh,parker hates pepperoni.Um,how about sausage?

211
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,580
Yeah,and a small cheese.

212
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,980
Okay,perfect. Love you.

213
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,850
Hey,you.

214
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,840
Hey.

215
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,870
You wanna hit o'donnell's?I owe you a beer.

216
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,950
Actually,I owe youso much more than that.

217
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,190
You're welcome,but I really need to get home.

218
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:21,310
Oh,come on. I had sucha good time last night.

219
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,150
Um,why don't you ask trudy?She loves going out.

220
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:27,100
Trudy? Are you kidding?I don't need the competition.

221
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,520
Have you seen trudywithout her jacket? She's hot.

222
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,970
Oh,is she now?

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,730
Oh,I-I didn't meanthat you're not... hot.

224
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:36,630
I just--you're married.

225
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,670
You know,you're off the market.

226
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,650
I don't have to worryabout fighting you for guys.

227
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:44,590
Come on,lynette.Just one quick little drink.

228
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,930
I was actuallystarting to think

229
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,020
that you and iwere becoming pals.

230
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,850
Pals? 'Cause sometimesit's hard to tell.

231
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,960
You know,I wasn't feelingthe love today

232
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,620
when you mocked my campaignin front of the clients.

233
00:10:57,650 --> 00:11:00,910
That was justputting on a show for work.

234
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:06,930
In the future,always assumethat I am winking inside.

235
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,160
Come on.I hate to go to a bar alone.

236
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,180
I feel like such a loser.

237
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,750
Okay. One drink.

238
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,300
Yeah! One or two.

239
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,740
No.

240
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,700
Thank you so muchfor bringing my mail over.

241
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,270
You know,I have someof yours in the kitchen.

242
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,140
Well,that's the fourth time.What's up with this postman?

243
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,150
Oh,I know.He used to be great.

244
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,910
Then he had this stroke,and,well,

245
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:58,820
now we're lucky if hedoesn't drool on the coupons.

246
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,670
But feel free to snoop around.I'll be right back.

247
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,310
now for those of you just joining us,

248
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:22,170
families in chicago breathed a sigh of relief today

249
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:24,840
as an arrest was finally made in the brutal attack

250
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,000
on local high school student melanie foster.

251
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,780
But word of the suspect's capture

252
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,290
comes as small comfort

253
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,220
to the foster family...

254
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:32,570
betty?

255
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,980
...Who lost their 17-year-old daughter

256
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,940
almost four months ago. Betty?

257
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,060
The victim's body was discovered in a local park

258
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,860
less than a mile from attenborough high.

259
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,640
Did you see the news?They've arrested somebody.

260
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:53,440
Yeah. Looks likewe're in the clear.

261
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,830
Well,I have some good news.

262
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,260
The police have finally releasedrex's body.

263
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,650
About time.You must be so relieved.

264
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,250
You know,mostly I'm just annoyed

265
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,080
that the whole thinghappened in the first place.

266
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:09,960
I mean,how in the world couldanybody accuse me of murder?

267
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,630
Well,you are wound pretty tight.

268
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,840
What? The supermom is alwaysthe first to snap.

269
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,220
They've done studies.

270
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:21,610
Anyway,I was hoping

271
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,170
that you were all freefriday morning,

272
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:27,450
because that's when I'm goingto be hosting the reburial.

273
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,940
The what?

274
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,280
Look,I know it's an imposition,

275
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,990
but danielle is awayon a class trip,

276
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:34,270
and andrew is backat camp hennessey

277
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:36,270
for a little refresher course.

278
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,170
Well,it's just gonna be

279
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:40,440
a very briefand dignified ceremony,

280
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,540
and I was hoping thatyou could say a few words,

281
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:46,770
and,um,I'm gonna read a poem.

282
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,980
We would love to come.Absolutely.

283
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,800
I'm busy. Sorry.

284
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,210
(Whispers) edie!

285
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,890
(Whispers)she's going to read a poem.

286
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:01,080
Ow!

287
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,980
Fine. Yes,yes,we'd all love to come.

288
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,040
Well,thank you.

289
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,160
You don't know how muchthis means to me.

290
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:15,580
I realize looking backthat I was still in shock

291
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,580
during rex's first funeral.

292
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,520
I don't think it had quitehit me yet what had happened,

293
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:24,270
so that's why this smallceremony means so much to me,

294
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,920
because I realize now that...

295
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:33,200
this is the last chanceI'm gonna have to say good-bye.

296
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,070
Oh.

297
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,440
Unless,of course,they dig him up again.

298
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,680
Sure,there was times when

299
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,770
lisa was rude and obnoxious,

300
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
but I know now thatthat was no excuse

301
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:53,910
to always be beatin' on her.

302
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:58,150
Oh,baby,I'm so sorry.

303
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:03,500
Good job,you two.

304
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:07,220
This is an example of how to useincarceration to your benefit.

305
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,850
It's a chance for peopleto take a step back

306
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,100
and observe the obstaclesthey face in their marriage.

307
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,490
Can I go now?'Cause I have a lot to say

308
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:18,060
about the obstacles I'm facingin my marriage.

309
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,280
We don't got any obstacles.

310
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,480
Yes,we do,lamar.We got big ones.

311
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,650
Okay,hold on,you two.

312
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,310
I think that it'scarlos and gabrielle's turn.

313
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:29,080
Thanks,but we're good.

314
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:33,620
this isyour third group session,

315
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:35,990
but you have yetto share anything.

316
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,600
Come on. Talk to us.How's your marriage?

317
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:43,690
Shaky at best.And why is that?

318
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,800
I don't know.I hired a brilliant lawyer

319
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,400
to get my husbandout of this hellhole,

320
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,300
and he fired himfor no reason at all.

321
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,630
Carlos?

322
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,720
I just didn't like him.

323
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,180
Why not? He's experienced,he's intelligent,

324
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,520
he's successful.Exactly.

325
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,060
I'd prefer an attorney youdidn't find so damn appealing.

326
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:02,660
Oh,my god. You fired himbecause you're jealous?

327
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
Don't I have the right to?

328
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,580
You know,she cheated on me.

329
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,210
oh,bob,you beat your wife.

330
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,590
You are so not allowed to gasp.

331
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,980
Don't you talk that wayto him.

332
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:12,370
One more word out of you,lisa,and I will backhand you myself.

333
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,710
Okay,calm down.

334
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,950
Thousands of fat,bald attorneysout there in the world,

335
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:17,970
and she's gotta get the one thatlooks like an underwear model.

336
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,240
I'm not discussing thisanymore.

337
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:21,990
You can rot in herefor all I care.

338
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,370
So,um...

339
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:29,600
mona,what do you feel

340
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,980
are the biggest problemsin your marriage?

341
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,680
By the way,he was wearing a suit.

342
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,080
How do you knowhe had a good body?

343
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:34,760
Do you know?

344
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:35,920
No!

345
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,490
I bet he's hot.

346
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:43,890
Do I need to say whatour biggest problem is,

347
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:47,460
or can everybody figure it outfor themselves?

348
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,080
Why are you readingthat contract?

349
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,510
I told you. Lonny wants meto sign with this new agency.

350
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,990
But you didn't say

351
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:00,130
you were seriously thinkingabout going with him.

352
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,730
I know,I know.

353
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,780
Just lonny's family.

354
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:07,260
You know,he's alwaysbeen there for me.

355
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,770
He paid my rentwhen I was waiting

356
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,230
for my first royalty check.

357
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,110
He called me every daywhen karl left.

358
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,400
I mean,I just owe himso much.

359
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,770
Susan,he committed a felony.

360
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:17,790
Okay,who in this room

361
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,870

362
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,770
Ah-ah-ah,not so fast.

363
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,980
Your agent represents you.

364
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,150
You've gotta be ableto trust him.

365
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,140
How is that gonna bepossible now?

366
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:31,910
Well,it's possible becauseI have faith in people.

367
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,150
I mean,lonny knowshe messed up,

368
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,270
and he's sorry.He's making restitution.

369
00:17:36,330 --> 00:17:38,900
What,you don't believe peopledeserve second chances?

370
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:41,890
Not when they messed upthis much,no.

371
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,360
Really? So that's it with you?You just get one shot,

372
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:47,420
and you screw up,and you're out?

373
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,510
I didn't knowyou were such a cynic.

374
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:51,050
Hey,I'm sorry,all right?

375
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:53,930
I guess it's justthe way I'm wired.

376
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,770
I got a jobover in greenwood,

377
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:00,400

378
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,740
You okay?

379
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,260
julie...

380
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:19,450
I did something bad,something really,really bad.

381
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,590
Aren't you gonna ask mewhat it was?

382
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,090
Do I ever have to?

383
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,750
Last week when mike and iwent to the park

384
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,320
searching for zach,

385
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,460
I sort of found him.

386
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,210
No!

387
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:37,590
Yes,and I gave him moneyand I sent him away,

388
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,510
and I didn't tell mike.

389
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,260
Holy crap.What are you gonna do?

390
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:45,920
I don't know. What would you doif this happened to you?

391
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,590
See,this would neverhappen to me.

392
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,180
This kind of thingonly happens to you.

393
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,620
Will you stop judgingand help me?

394
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,770
Well,obviously,you're gonna have to tell him.

395
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Well,I can't do that.

396
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,510
You heard what he saidabout his wiring.

397
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,450
I betrayed him.

398
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,910
He'll never forgive me.Okay. Don't tell him.

399
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,190
Well,how can I not?I feel so guilty,

400
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,210
I can barely look him in the eyewhen he talks about zach.

401
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,260
So where do you thinkzach went?

402
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,950
Utah.

403
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,920
Oh,lord.Why did I do this?

404
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,430
I have a feelingyou did it for me.

405
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:40,370
Hey,girl. I hope you arein the mood for margaritas

406

408
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,350
that I would help themfinish their science project.

409
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,190
Lynette,if the late hours

410
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,040

411
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,310

412
00:19:57,340 --> 00:20:00,090
a less demanding account.

413
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,400
You're gonnatake me off kamarov

414
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,810

Thank you.

419
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:13,510
I mean,for me,the client comes first.

420
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,260
Me being a perfectionistis my own neurotic issue,

421
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:17,670

422
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:20,030

441
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,180
Until you start acceptingresponsibility

442
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,050

Don'T.

452
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:36,200
"I know who really killedmelanie foster.

453
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,380
"You've arrestedthe wrong man"?

454
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,420
What are you thinking?

455
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,100
The police need to knowthe truth.

456
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,500
The hell they do!This is our chance.

457
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,630
We are good people.

458
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,810
We can't letan innocent man go to jail.

459
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,930
Okay,you wanna dothe right thing?

00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:54,820
He is not a killer.He was confused.

463
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:56,640
He didn't knowwhat he was doing.

464
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,020
He knows a lot more thanyou give him credit for.

465
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,150
I'm mailing the letter.

466
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:03,260

00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:18,990
'Cause they're not gonna carehow slow caleb is.

471
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,450

00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,020
Your door was open.

479
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,250
Oh. Great.

480
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:03,330
Sorry this placeis such a mess.

481
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:06,430

484
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,320
Where's jeannie?

485
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:15,950
She's with the kidsup in minnesota

486
00:24:15,970 --> 00:24:16,910
visiting her mom.

487
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:19,090
They love it up there.

488
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,460
Keep changing the dateon dear old dad.

489
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,000
There's no electricity.

490
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,600
There isn't?

491
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:34,030
Oh,I'm such a dummy.

492
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,150
I've been...

493
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,120
I've been so swamped,

494
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,380
I must have forgottento pay the electric bill.

495
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,320
Lonny...

496
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:47,120
how much financial troubleare you really in?

497
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:50,840
I'm fine.

498
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,280
You know what it is?

499
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,500
I had to pay all those peopleback at the same time--

500
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,070
restitution plus interest.

501
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,070
It's not somethingI'd recommend.

502
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,460
It sucks you dry.

503
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,690
I've gonna ask youa question,

504
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:06,520
and I want youto tell me the truth.

505
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,440
Did you steal from me?

506
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,210
Absolutely not.

507
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,880
Please don't lie.Just tell me.

508
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,820
Is that what you wantto hear?

509
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:20,950
Do I have to say itso that we can move on?

510
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,940
Fine. I did it.

511
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,060
But yours wasthe first money I paid back,

512
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,890
so the slate'sbeen wiped clean.

513
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,430
Let's just move past it.

514
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,740
Suze?

515
00:25:34,390 --> 00:25:37,210

Give me the contract!

519
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,480

520
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,320

521
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,080
Aah! What are you doing?!

522
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,520
Are you tryingto take me down with you?!

523
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:56,520
I am not going down!

524
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,490
My life is great!

525

Yeah,I thought you'd schedulean appointment later.

532
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:30,440
Right now I'm sort ofdisgusting and sweaty.

533
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:34,450
I'm a criminal lawyer.I've seen worse.

534
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:46,160
So did you find a new lawyerfor mr. Charming?

535
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,120
I don't want a new lawyer.I want you.

536
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,720

Look,to be honest,carlos isa little threatened by you.

539
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,400
He thinks if we spendtoo much time together,

540
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:03,940
that something...might happen.

541
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:06,780
Somebody's gotan active imagination.

542
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,610
Corkscrew?

543
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,100
David,we're not hereto drink wine,okay?

544
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,520
This is business.

545
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,790
Now you have to convincecarlos that he can trust you.

546
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,730
How am I gonna do that?

547
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,000
I don't know. Tell him you'rehappily married or--or gay.

548
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,800
yeah,right.

549
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,200
You're a lawyer. You lieto juries all the time.

550
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,480
Can't you just make something up?

551
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,600
I'm past the pointin my career

552
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,420
where I have to beg for work.I'm sorry.

553
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,260
Okay,david,I'm holdingmy marriage together

554
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,510
by my fingernails.

555
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,820
If carlos serveshis full sentence,

556
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,960
I don't think we're gonnamake it,so please,I need you.

557
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,600
I'll say this much for carlos.He's got excellent taste...

558
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,170
in wine. Montrachet.It's good stuff.

559
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,890
Are you gonna help meor not?

560
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:57,340
We'll go see carlos tomorrow.I'll turn him around for you.

561
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,630
Really?What are you gonna say?

562
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:04,700
Play it by ear. I don't wannasound too over-rehearsed.

563
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,800
Hey,that's my wine.

564
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,210
Deduct it from my bill.

565
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:16,780
It all started withbad real estate investments.

566
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,110
You should have justcome clean.

567
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:23,280
Yeah,well,you tell one lie,the second one comes easy.

568
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:26,250
Then you're making up new liesto cover up the old ones.

569
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:29,560
Pretty soon,you can't turn back,you know?

570
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:32,220
I do.

571
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:36,060
When jeannie finally caught on,she took the kids.

572
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:38,210
She took the furniture.

573
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:42,950
The bank locked meout of my own house.

574
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,790
Wow.

575
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,400
That's why I can't lose youas a client.

576
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,080
Well,I'm sorry,but you have.

577
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:55,150
I don't blame you.

578
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:58,360
You'll never losemy friendship,though.

579
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,570
I mean that.

580
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,360
Really?

581
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:04,120
Of course.You're my lonny.

582
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:08,080
and you're my susie.

583
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,020
you're my susie.

584
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:17,250
Oh! What the hellis wrong with you?!

585
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,900
I'm your lonny.That's what you said.

586
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:19,940
Not like that.

587
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,850
But I thought...

588
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,540
I mean,there's alwaysbeen this magnetism.

589
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,730
No,there has not been,and there never will be!

590
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:28,690
Oh,my god!

591
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:32,160
But I was just coming clean!

592
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:36,720
Hey,morgan!

593
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,760
Got a letterfrom some guy

594
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:42,360
claiming he attackedmelanie foster.

595
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:44,000
You ran me down for that?

596
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:46,040
I got dozens of kookscoming out of the woodwork,

597
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,420
all saying we arrestedthe wrong guy.

598
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,880
This one knowsabout the ax.

599
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,630
Here you go,mrs. Van de kamp.

600
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,320
Thank you.The hearse is right outside,

601
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,090
so if you'll justfollow me...

602
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,450
oh,shoot. There's a formI need you to sign.

603
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,120
I think I left itback in the office.

604
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:19,630
That's all right.

605
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:21,770
I'll wait.Okay.

606
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,660
I'm here,sweetheart,

607
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,890
and I'm gonna take careof everything.

608
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:36,310
But you knew that,didn't you?

609
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,650
You've always knownthat you can count on me.

610
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:41,810
Mrs. Van de kamp.

611
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,130
Detective barton,what are you doing here?

612
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,740
Oh,just taking careof some business.

613
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,050
Is this...

614
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:52,630
yes. This is rex.

615
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:55,960
I-I wanna thank you againfor what you did.

616
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:58,890
It was so refreshingto be treated with kindness

617
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,020
after weeks of justludicrous accusations.

618
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:04,650
The doctor doesn't thinkthey're ludicrous.

619
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,130
Well,I know,but rex died in his care.

620
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,250
I mean,of course he'd liketo blame someone else.

621
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,690
But the tests he did,uh...

622
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,020
oh,please don't talk to meabout tests.

623
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,310
Rex was not poisoned,

624
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:17,820
and no one I knowbelieves that he was.

625
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,570
Rex did.

626
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,300
What?

627
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:23,090
Well,the doctor told rexhe was being poisoned,

628
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,620
and rex believed him.

629
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,430
How would you know that?

630
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,290
Oh!

631
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:39,680
Where did you get this?

632
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,190
We found that in rex's bedafter he died.

633
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,340
That is his handwriting,isn't it?

634
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:55,140
You know what I think?

635
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:00,590
Rex felt guiltyfor the way he treated you.

636
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,240
The adultery,the public humiliations.

637
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:09,060
That's why he forgave you.He understood why you did it.

638
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:12,400
How couldhe have believed this?

639
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,760
Look,my wife cheated on me,too.

640
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,960
I know how much it hurts.

641
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,900
And so will a judge.

642
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:23,830
Everyone understandscrimes of passion.

643
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:27,770
But every daythat you stonewall

644
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,000
makes you lookmore and more

645
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:32,040
like a cold,calculating killer.

646
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:35,370
We both knowthat's not you.

647
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:41,000
But I can't help you unlessyou start telling the truth.

648
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:53,180
I'm sorry,but I-I,um,I have to go.

649
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:57,280
I have some thingsthat I need to take care of.

650
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,750
Bree,it is obvious your husbandloved you very much.

651
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,320
Don't you think you owe to himto admit the truth?

652
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,400
Detective,I know exactlywhat my husband deserves.

653
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,970
Now would you be a dear?

654
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,000
Thank you.

655
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:32,110
What's he doing here?

656
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,620
I have a pitch for you.

657
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,820
I wanna explain to you

658
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,780
why I think it's in your bestinterest for you to allow me

659
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,050
to represent you.

660
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:45,480
Oh,for pete's sake,carlos,at least listen to the man.

661
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:49,750
I guess it beatssitting in my cell.

662
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,540
Now I don't think you havea problem with me as a lawyer.

663
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,090
Clearly,I'm the real deal.

664
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:58,460
I sense your problemwith me is more personal.

665
00:33:58,510 --> 00:33:59,820
You sense right.

666
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,140
You wanna know if I'm interestedin sleeping with your wife.

667
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,360
And the answer is yes.

668
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:16,140
he--carlos,he's kidding.

669
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,390
tell him you're kidding.

670
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,350
Shut it.

671
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,240
Now clearly,

672
00:34:21,290 --> 00:34:25,300
gabrielle's willful,self-centered and manipulative.

673
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,670
She's also beautiful enoughto be worth the trouble.

674
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,830
So the minutewe leave this room,

675
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,580
I'm going to aggressivelypursue her,

676
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,950
and when I succeed,which I will,

677
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,550
we're gonna flyto my chateau in chamonix

678
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:35,960
and have dinnerin a local bistro.

679
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:38,200
They make the best raclettein all of europe.

680
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,710
We'll make love by the fireand afterwards

681
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,260
do a little midnight skiing.You ski,don't you?

682
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,310
You're athletic.You'll learn.

683
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,050
Anyway,all of thisonly happens if you fire me.

684
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,350
If you keep me onas your lawyer,

685
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,220
your wife's off-limits.

686
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,300
I'd get disbarred for sleepingwith a client's wife,

687
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:59,380
and nobody's worth that,not even her.

688
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,680
So that's my pitch.

689
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,860
I'll let you think about it.

690
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:11,710
Honey,I am so sorry.

691
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,720
Honestly,that guy's insane.

692
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:17,380
Boy,you just can't wait,can you?

693
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,930
What?

694
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,940
He's my lawyer.But,carlos--

695
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:25,460
and that's allthere is to it.

696
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:34,660
How about a dance?

697
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:37,430
How about it? Yes.

698
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,390
Well,you guys have fun.

699
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,230
This is the fifth nightin a row

700
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:42,990
I haven't been hometo tuck in my kids,

701
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,570
so I'm gonna go.

702
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,210
No. You're gonna stay put.It is friday night,

703
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,420
and you have all weekendto play with your kids.

704
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,400
Watch my purse.

705
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:07,210
Hey.

706
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,870
I'm chuck.

707
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:11,930
Chuck,I'm gonna stop youright there.

708
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,600
Happily married.

709
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,280
Well...

710
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,920
looks like we have gotsomething in common.

711
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,520
Ugh.

712
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,250
Chuck?

713
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:28,350
Get your handoff my thigh.

714
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:32,900
No,not up my thigh.Off it.

715
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,300
Come on!What's the matter with you?

716
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,590
I'm not available.And I'm not that easy!

717
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,100
Well,what are you doing ina pick-up bar at 10:30 at night?

718
00:36:39,150 --> 00:36:41,590
Well,I don't usuallydo this.

719
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:43,850
Oh,come on,honey,who are you kidding?

720
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:47,450
I've seen you here every nightthis week. You're a regular.

721
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,970
At that moment it occurred to lynette

722
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,980
that chuck,though inebriated,

723
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,790
had a valid point.

724
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,740
The time had come to declare

725
00:36:55,770 --> 00:36:58,000
a war of independence.

726
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,060
And the surest path to victory

727
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,810
would require an aggressive campaign

728
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,630
of shock...

729
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,700
and awe.

730
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,920
it's crazy here tonight.

731
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:16,910
Don't you wantto dance?

732
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,860
No,thanks. I thinkI'll sit this one out.

733
00:38:20,890 --> 00:38:22,770
Lynette savored her victory

734
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,720
confident that she would never again

735
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:28,970
have to engage her opponent on this particular battlefield.

736
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:30,640
Ooh! I love this song.

737
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:33,510
Here,hold my purse.

738
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:45,270
Bree,where have you been?We were starting to get worried.

739
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:45,870
Oh,I'm sorry.

740
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,260
I was just attendingto some last minute details.

741
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,110
Right this way.Where are we going?

742
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,790
To rex's gravesite.

743
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,450
Well,I thought thatthis was his gravesite.

744
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,260
I'm changing it.Why?

745
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:58,830
Well,he did something toupset me,and I want him gone.

746
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,620
What did he do?

747
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,190
You know,it's so unpleasant.I'd rather not get into it.

748
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:05,420
Have you seen these gravestones?Some are from the 1800s.

749
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,830
Just fascinating.

750
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,300
Bree,wait,you're gonnahave to explain.

751
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:12,790
Rex is dead. What couldhe have done to upset you?

752
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:19,290
My husband,the man I spentmy life with for 18 years,

753
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,360
died thinkingthat I murdered him.

754
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,220
What?

755
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:25,030
Yes,the cardiologist sharedthis moronic theory with rex.

756
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,460
And rex believed him!

757
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,450
Are you sure?

758
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,490
Yes,because he left a noteand it said,and I quote,

759
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:36,710
"bree,I understand.And I forgive you."

760
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:41,810
I spent 18 years of my lifewith this man.

761
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,430
How could he not know me?

762
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:48,320
Well,maybe he was forgiving youfor something else.

763
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,680
I have done nothing to be forgiven for!

764
00:39:54,710 --> 00:39:57,420
I was a fantastic wife!

765
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,090
When he was sick,I nursed him.

766
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:01,480
When we were low on money,I stayed within a budget.

767
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,880
I cooked his meals.I mended his clothes.

768
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,620
For the love of god,I usedto check his back for acne.

769
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:11,420
And that miserableson of a bitch

770
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,460
has the nerve to understandand forgive me?

771
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,410
Well,the joke's on him,

772
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:20,590
because I do not understand,and I do not forgive.

773
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,290
Hi. We're--we're just going to a funeral.

774
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:31,120
Right this way.

775
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:44,080
Honey,I know you're hurt,but are you sure

776
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:45,750
you're not gonnachange your mind?

777
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:48,240
I mean,there's noturning back after this.

778
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,600
If you think I'm gonnalay next to someone for eternity

779
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,650
who thinks I'm a murderer,you're crazy.

780
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:54,700
As far as I'm concerned,

781
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:58,910
let him decomposewith strangers.

782
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:17,750
Everyone in the world needs someone they can depend on,

783
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:21,530
be they faithful friends,

784
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,660
determined advocates...

785
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,700
or a loving family.

786
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,840
But occasionally in life,

787
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:41,090
the people we thought would always be there for us leave.

788
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,140
And if that happens,

789
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,650
it's amazing the lengths we'll go to...

790
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:52,680
to get them back.

791
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:53,980
