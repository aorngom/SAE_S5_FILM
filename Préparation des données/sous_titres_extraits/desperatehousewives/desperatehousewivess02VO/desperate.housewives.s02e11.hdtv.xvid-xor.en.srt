1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:04,870
george paid for what he didto your father.

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:06,290
Bree confessed...

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,370
did you give zach moneyto go to utah?

4
00:00:08,370 --> 00:00:10,060
Susan betrayed mike...

5
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,220
what kind of friend is he?

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:12,640
The real good kind.

7
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,880
Andrew pushed the boundaries...

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,220
zach's come home.Is there anything I can do?

9
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:18,670
Paul put his foot down...

10
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:19,990
you can leave us alone.

11
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,420
So when do I tell peopleyou'll be back?

12
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:23,180
Couple,maybe three days.

13
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:28,410
And a stranger finally caught up with caleb.

14
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,190
kisses are such simple things,

15
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,410
we hardly notice them.

16
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:37,420
But if we paid more attention,

17
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:41,830
we'd see that each kiss conveys a meaning 
all its own.

18
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:43,130
For example,

19
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,810
some can say,"I'm so happy to see you."

20
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,880
Or,"I didn't realize you'd be here."

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,970
Bye.

22
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:58,230
Or,"honey,it's time to stop drinking."

23
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:02,210
The trick is in knowing how to tell the 
difference.

24
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:05,110
So I finally said,if I'm head cheerleader,

25
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:06,560
then nobodywears panties.

26
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,570
Yeah!

27
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,600
I just want you to knowas a former member

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,490
of my high school marching band,I would've 
appreciated that.

29
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,090
Wait a second,you were a bandgeek?

30
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,460
Oh,I don't believe it.

31
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,360
What did you play?

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,400
He played the tuba.I have pictures.

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,730
The tuba,huh?

34
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,640
Yeah,go ahead,come on,comeon,
get your licks in,go ahead.

35
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,420
No,no,not at all.As a matter of fact,

36
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,140
all of my secret crusheswere on the band geeks.

37
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:31,490
Come on,I know you cheerleader types.

38
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:33,350
You wouldn't have said "boo"to guys like me.

39
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,220
No,you were more interestedin the 
guys like--like this.Now,

40
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,660
I take ityou didn't play the tuba.

41
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,880
No,I didn'T.

42
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:44,300
All I know is,I was a lonely,insecure tuba player.

43
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,130
Girls like gabrielle would justrip my heart out.

44
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,930
Aw.

45
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:50,490
I didn't even had my first kissuntil I was 18.

46
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,490
-18?
-Pathetic,I know.

47
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:54,600
Poor baby.I would've kissed you.

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,350
No,you wouldn't have.Yes,I would have.

49
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,680
No,you wouldn't have.And it's okay,gaby.

50
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,920
Those scars healeda long time ago.

51
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,960
Oh,for god sakes,come here.

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,260
Now on behalf of allthe cheerleaders in the world,

53
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,160
forgive us.

54
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,380
Oh,yeah!Whoo!

55
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:15,980
Yes,kisses mean different things to 
different people.

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,260
Ultimately,the meaning depends

57
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,550
on the one who does the kissing...

58
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,870
wowie.

59
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:27,300
cheers.

60
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,090
And the who sees it happen.

Desperate Housewives
Season 02 Episode 01

64
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,360
after every party

65
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,800
comes the time for cleaning.

66
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,450
We attend to the champagne

67
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:49,570
that was spilled,

68
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,680
the knickknacks that got broken,

69
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:56,970
the food that went uneaten.

70
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,450
Oh,here, let me take that.

71
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,770
And whatever other messes need cleaning up.

72
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:07,580
So,uh,gaby...

73
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,000
you know that thing

74
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,770
you and tom did tonight?

75
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,550
The--the kiss?

76
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,000
Was that hysterical?

77
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,890
The look on tom's face!

78
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,930
Yeah.

79
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:28,230
I know this sounds silly,

80
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,070
but...

81
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,960
it kind of bugged me.

82
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,550
You're not serious.

83
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,480
Yeah,I am.

84
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,260
I don't--

85
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,860
I don't want to make a big deal out of it,

86
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,350
but,uh,

87
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,390
could you maybe

88
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,930
not do that again?

89
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,720
Okay.

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,670
Thanks.

91
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,260
Okay.

92
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,170
Hey,what happened to the applewhites?

93
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,820
I thought you were gonna invite them.

94
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,580
I did. Betty never R.S.V.P.'D.

95
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,440
What do you guys think about the applewhites?

96
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,500
I like 'em,very nice.

97
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,730
Very...

98
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,610
interesting.

99
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,840
Right,interesting.

100
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,270
Hmm,they weird me out,too.

101
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,200
well,that's not what we're saying.

102
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,220
not exactly,anyway.

103
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,580
You know, we were just having fun,

104
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,270
entertaining the crowd.

105
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,820
Oh,sure,but...

106
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,900
but maybe next time you could try 
juggling instead.

107
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,370
What's going on?

108
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,160
Nothing.

109
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,160
Really?

110
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,200
I sense a little tension.

111
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,390
No,no tension.

112
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,170
What?

113
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,710
You make it sound like...

114
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,070
I was making a pass at your husband.

115
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,900
And that's just a little bit insulting.

116
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,110
I just said it bugged me.

117
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,280
Why is that a problem?

118
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,120
Is this about that kiss?

119
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,110
What kiss?

120
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:47,590
Oh,you were in the living room.

121
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,430
Gaby planted a big,wet kiss

122
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,820
on tom... as a joke.

123
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,650
It was hilarious.

124
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,370
You see?

125
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:54,950
Yeah,but to be fair to lynette,

126
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,240
you are an ex-model.

127
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,800
And surely it must have dawned on you that 
some women

128
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,470
might prefer it if you didn't kiss their husbands.

129
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,250
That's all I'm saying.

130
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,420
Oh,you guys, we're all friends.

131
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,850
This isn't something to get worked up over.

132
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,040
I'm not worked up.

133
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,720
Me neither.

134
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:14,000
Hey,everyone,

135
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,190
did you see what kathy lewis was wearing tonight?

136
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,900
And whoever told her that she could get away

137
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,280
with those vertical stripes should be shot.

138
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,060
Oh.

139
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,810
Bye,sweetie.

140
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:51,640
Zach is back!

141
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,310
Yeah,yeah,I know.

142
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:54,840
You do?

143
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,420
Yeah,he's been back for a couple of days now.

144
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,480
Well,that's great,isn't it?

145
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,860
Yeah.

146
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,100
I thought you'd be happy about it.

147
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,600
I thought that's what you wanted.

148
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,520
I was hoping that I'd slowly establish

149
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,700
a relationship with zach

150
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,340
and then when we were comfortable,

151
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,670
I'd tell him I was his real dad.

152
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,870
But now paul's back.

153
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,830
And he doesn't want you anywhere near him.

154
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,270
He's threatened to tell the police

155
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,890
everything that happened in the desert--

156
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,400
that I held a gun to his head.

157
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,410
Well,it's your word against his.

158
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:25,400
But he doesn't have a record,and I do.

159
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,990
You know,despite what I did--

160
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,380
sending zach away,

161
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,020
I want you two to connect.

162
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,320
I hope you know that.

163
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,490
I do.

164
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,540
And on the bright side,

165
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,730
I don't have to wonder where he is anymore.

166
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,960
It says that you can do a report on anything

167
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,620
from the suggested reading list,

168
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,660
which includes "the old man and the sea,"

169
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,660
"the pearl,"

170
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:55,230
"much ado about nothing."

171
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,730
Hmm.

172
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,060
That sounds good. What do you like?

173
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,170
I don't care.

174
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:04,360
Let's start with "the pearl."

175
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,240
It's got a sad ending,but it's good.

176
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,110
We'll start with that.

177
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,130
You know,

178
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,150
it's not gonna be so bad.

179
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:18,690
but maybe next time you could try 

juggling instead.

180
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,400
Okay,

181
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,280
I know this isn't what you want.

182
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,980
But I need to keep you close to me

183
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,570
just for a while.

184
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,180
There are peoplein this neighborhood

185
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,260
who aren't thrilledthat we're back.

186
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,390
People I don't trust.

187
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:37,410
People like...mike delfino?

188
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,880
Why would yousay that?

189
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,550
When you disappeared,

190
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:44,960
mrs. Tillman said that miketook you somewhere 
to kill you.

191
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,540
That's ridiculous.Why would mike wanna kill me?

192
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:51,220
Because you murderedmrs. Huber?

193
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,200
What did you say?

194
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:55,050
Well,mrs. Tillman said thatyou murdered mrs. Huber

195
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,580
because she wasblackmailing mom.

196
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,840
And you believed her?

197
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,820
No,not exactly.

198
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,300
I mean,why? Should I?

199
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,080
Zach,you know me

200
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,960
Better than anyone.

201
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,200
Do you honestly believe that I am capableof 
murder?

202
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,770
No.

203
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,770
All right,then.

204
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,320
Of course...

205
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:25,500
I didn't think mom was capableof suicide,either.

206
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,480
On second thought,

207
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,910
why don't we start with"much ado about nothing"?

208
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:35,430
I think we could usea few laughs around here.

209
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,910
Yeah,man...

210
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:41,790
yeah,he sure is.I just...

211
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:44,480
-probably.
-Yeah.

212
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,380
hey.

213
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,760
Get over here. Now.

214
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,860
Somebody's angry.

215
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,400
Did oneof your soufflés fall?

216
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,370
I saw what you didwith your friend.

217
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,600
Oh,and you didn't turn intoa pillar of salt. 
Good for you.

218
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,320
This is not a joke,andrew.

219
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,340
What if the neighborshad seen you?

220
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:18,420
Well,I'd hope they'd thinkthat I'd 
landed a hottie.

221
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,660
I may not be able to control

222
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,990
what you do outsideof this home,

223
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,300
but whileyou are under this roof,

224
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,460
you will not mockmy values.

225
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,860
If you so muchas smile at that boy,

226
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:28,900
so help me,I will ship you offto camp hennessey

227
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,800
and I will not pick you upagain until you are 18.

228
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,000
Do I make myself clear?

229
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:39,480
Aren't you forgettingsomething?

230
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,380
I know you like to knocka few back before bedtime.

231
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,410
Go on,take it. It's okay.

232
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:48,900
We both knowthat of the two of us,

233
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,270
I'm the onethat doesn't judge.

234
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:05,420
Please. I don't wannastay down here.

235
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,560
I-I know.

236
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,220
I'm sorry,K.

237
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,700
I'm sorry.

238
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,240
Matthew,I think we mighthave termites.

239
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,540
You need to takea look at those steps

240
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,900
before one of usbreaks our neck.

241
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,800
What's the matter?Is your brother okay?

242
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:28,380
No,he's not.He hates it down here.

243
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,520
He wants to be with us.You're being cruel.

244
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,400
If you are so concernedabout him,

245
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,840
you should spend less timeon your computer

246
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,580
and more time down herekeeping him company.

247
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,160
We're bringing him up,

248
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,810
but not until I am surethat it's safe.

249
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,720
there's been a load of compromising

250
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:52,660
on the road to my horizon

251
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,460
hey,you!

252
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:04,390
Like a rhinestone cowboy

253
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,280
yeah?

254
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,910
What's the deal?

255
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,380
You've been parked on our streetfor two hours.

256
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,660
Oh,I'm doinga property appraisal.

257
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:16,080
Some neighbors of yoursare thinking about moving.

258
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,700
The applewhites?

259
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,670
I'm not reallyallowed to say.

260
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:23,320
I sold them that house.You know,this is my turf!

261
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,550
Who do you work for?

262
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,880
Geist realty?

263
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,580
Ah,westside properties.

264
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,240
Yeah,well,whoever it is,you go back

265
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,760
and you tell your bossesthat nobody,
and I mean,nobody,

266
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,830
buys or sells propertiesin this neighborhood

267
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,280
without going throughedie britt,you got that?

268
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,080
Look,lady,I just gowhere I'm told.

269
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,840
You look,you cross me,

270
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,980
and I will beyour worst nightmare.

271
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,040
I'm a dangerous woman.You don't 
wanna mess with me.

272
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,080
You got it.

273
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,510
Ms. Mayer?

274
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,090
Zach.May I talk to you?

275
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,830
I have some thingsthat I need to say.

276
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,790
Okay.

277
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:15,450
I-I know that I dida lot of bad stuff--

278
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,090
stuff that I'm not gonnabe able to take back.

279
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:20,730
Ms. Mayer,I'm--I'm really sorry.

280
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:22,510
But when I was livingon the streets,you know,

281
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:25,590
I had a lot of time to--to just sit and 
think to myself

282
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,670
and clear my head and...

283
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,910
I've grown up,you know?I don't want you to worry.

284
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:33,120
I'm not gonna bebothering you anymore.

285
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,470
Either of you.

286
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:40,620
Well,thanks.We appreciate that.

287
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,330
Please don't tell my dadthat I talked to you.

288
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,790
He's just--he's been really...

289
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:50,830
intense lately.

290
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:56,870
Well,what do you think?

291
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,910
He seems different.

292
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,350
I believe him.

293
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,780
Yeah,I can't believeI'm about to say this,

294
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,980
but I feel sorry for him.

295
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,100
It's likehe's so fragile.

296
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,390
I know,and he's locked in thathouse 
with mr. Creepy 24/7.

297
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,990
Did you know that he'shomeschooling zach now?

298
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,450
I think he shouldspend some time

299
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:17,760
with a decent role model,don't you?

300
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,630
Hi!

301
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,530
Hey,you're out early.

302
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,550
Oh,I just wanted to pick up

303
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:29,540
some fresh croissantsfor breakfast.

304
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:32,310
Oh,cool. Listen,I just wanted you to know

305
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,980
I appreciated youbacking me up last night,

306
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:38,040
you know,with the kiss thing.

307
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,250
To be honest,I don't thinkI would've 
liked it,either.

308
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,720
Yeah,but I probablyshould've just gone with it.

309
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:45,450
Gaby was just being gaby--having fun.

310
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:49,880
No,I wouldn't be so hardon yourself,
given her history.

311
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,890
What do you mean?

312
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:52,070
You know,the affair.

313
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,680
Gaby had an affair?

314
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,680
-You didn't know?
-No!

315
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,900
I thought everybody knew.

316
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,450
Oh,I feel awful.

317
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,970
Oh,ida greenberg'sbehind you.

318
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:05,850
Ida,just a second.

319
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,190
I am stunned.

320
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,080
Who was it with?

321
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,340
I shouldn'thave said anything.

322
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,380
Bree,come on,just tell me.

323
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,980
her gardener.

324
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,580
Oh,you're kidding!

325
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:23,910
No,no,not him.Helen rowland's son,john.

326
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:26,330
The teenager?

327
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:30,120
ida,wait,or go around!

328
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,780
Does gaby knowthat you know?

329
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,020
Absolutely not.

330
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,090
I thinkthe best thing to do

331
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:38,040
is just smile and pretendyou don't know anything.

332
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,900
Hi.

333
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,930
Oh,sorry!

334
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,280
Are you okay?

335
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,280
Yeah.

336
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,200
I'm all right.

337
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,860
What's up?

338
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:09,150
We have an idea how to bringyou and zach together.

339
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:11,480
Bowling.

340
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,290
-Bowling?
-Yeah,I e-mailed zach,

341
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,030
and he said he's gonna meetus there.

342
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:16,210
You can come,too.

343
00:15:16,210 --> 00:15:17,480
Does paul knowabout this?

344
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:23,080
No,and we're not planningon telling him.

345
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,670
I don't thinkthat's a good idea,susan.

346
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:28,990
Mike,I'm part of the reasonthings got 
so screwed up.

347
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,350
I just want a chanceto make things right.

348
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,100
And you're okay with this--being around zach?

349
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,240
We talked to him.He's changed.

350
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,130
Well,I guesswe're going bowling.

351
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,040
Wake up,sleepyhead.

352
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,530
I brought fresh croissantsfor breakfast!

353
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,900
uh,hi,mrs. Van de kamp.

354
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:04,120
I'm justin,andrew's lab partner...

355
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,730
from school.

356
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,800
Dude,wake up.

357
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,930
Andrew...

358
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,580
I want you downstairs... now.

359
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,890
Okay,first of all,I want youto march back upstairs

360
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:27,930
and tell your friend he isno longer welcome 
in this house.

361
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,900
But we haven't even had breakfast yet!

362
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,110
I am serious,andrew.

363
00:16:30,110 --> 00:16:31,710
You tell himto get out of here this second

364
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,840
or I will call the police,

365
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,980
and I will have him removed!

366
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,390
Well,go ahead,call 'em.

367
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:38,640
Oh,you think I won't?

368
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,380
I just wonderhow they'll react

369
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:43,530
when they find out thatyou killed george williams.

370
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,340
I didn't kill george.

371
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,560
Well,no,but you sat thereand let him die,

372
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,690
which,I'm no lawyer,but I'm pretty sure

373
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,650
there's a crimein there somewhere.

374
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,690
Andrew...

375
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:57,340
don't get me wrong.I mean,I'm glad you did it.

376
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:00,700
But when the cops get here,my official 
position will be,

377
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:05,480
uh,"oh,my god,I'm beingraised by a 
homicidal maniac."

378
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,440
I think I might eventhrow in a few tears.

379
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,160
You would actuallylet the police

380
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,940
arrest your own mother?

381
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,720
Hey,we all gotta cutthe apron strings at 
some point.

382
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:26,300
Come on,penny. Let's getthose groceries in there.

383
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,070
Come on. Here we go.Get this one...

384
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:32,640
and this one,and daddy--uh-oh! Whoa!

385
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:34,470
oh!

386
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,860
Oh,it looks likeyou could use a hand.

387
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,610
Bless you. Here,gaby.

388
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,510
And penny!

389
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:44,490
Oh,come here,you sweet little thing.

390
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:47,030
Well,thank you so much,gaby.Come on in.

391
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,290
Oh,god,um,tom?

392
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:51,290
Yeah?

393
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,320
Uh,I thinkshe got sick.

394
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,070
Oh,I'm so sorry.

395
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:58,680
Usually,she only throws upon immediate family.

396
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,440
I'm honored.

397
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:04,520
oh,um,do you mind just puttingher in the 
playpen there?

398
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,490
hello.

399
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,240
Guess what? Ed loved the pitch.I got off early!

400
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,210
You're kidding! That's great!

401
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,370
Hey,I'm rightby the supermarket.

402
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:14,500
You want me to pick up anything?

403
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,000
Um,actually,I just came from there.

404
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,030
Except,you know what?I forgot bread.

405
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:19,600
-Would you mind?
-Not at all.

406
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,760
Tom,I need to wipe up.Do you have a towel?

407
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,080
Sure,hold on.

408
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:33,840
Hey!

409
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,610
Hey,honey.

410
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:36,700
Hey,did you get the bread?

411
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:39,050
Oh,yeah,they were out.

412
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,860
Of bread?

413
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:41,880
Yeah. Hey,gaby.

414
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,580
A surprise seeing you here.

415
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,520
Well,I saw that tomwas overwhelmed,

416
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,800
so I thoughtI'd give him a hand.

417
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:51,690
Really?Wow,that was nice of you.

418
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,160
Is there a problem?

419
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,240
No.

420
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:00,340
Really?

421
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,810
Because I sensethat you're annoyed

422
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:05,520
you found me here whenyou weren't home. 
Am I wrong?

423
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,860
Lynette?

424
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:13,280
Okay. yeah.

425
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,830
So exactly what are youdoing here helping out?

426
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:18,920
Damn it,lynette,if thishas to do with that 
stupid kiss

427
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,530
the other night,I'm gonna lose it!

428
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:23,030
Whoa,whoa,whoa,what's going on?

429
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,440
Lynette thinks I was hittingon you at bree's 
party.

430
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,760
that's ridiculous.

431
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,170
I never said that.

432
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,380
What I said was that it made me uncomfortable

433
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,520
when you kissed him.

434
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,270
It's obviouslyan issue for me.

435
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,630
And yet,here you are,alone inmy kitchen with 
my husband.

436
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,830
So you tell me,are you hitting on him?

437
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,820
Lynette.

438
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,730
I can't believe you.I have done nothing

439
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:43,720
to deserve this kindof mistrust.

440
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,280
Well,that's not entirely true.

441
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,330
What does that mean?

442
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:49,200
Come on,gaby.

443
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,650
It's a small town. People talk.

444
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,570
Okay,what's going on here?

445
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:00,870
I'll tell you.

446
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:02,670
Your wife doesn't trust mearound you

447
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:07,060
because I had an affairwith my teenage gardener.

448
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:13,410
Oh.

449
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:17,980
So I know susan mayerwould never tell.

450
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,690
It must've beenhelen rowland.

451
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,820
She probably blabbedto all the girls at the salon.

452
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,740
And ida greenberggoes to that salon.

453
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,440
So if ida knows,the whole town knows.

454
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,760
And we're just gonna have tomove. 
That's all there is to it.

455
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,420
Carlos,can you stop puttingfor two seconds

456
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,270
and show me some support?

457
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:35,510
What do you expect me to do?You 
brought this on yourself.

458
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:37,220
It wasa harmless little kiss!

459
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,820
Why is everybody makinga big deal about this?

460
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,600
Because you had an affairwith an 
underage gardener.

461
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,240
People don't thinkyou're harmless.

462
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,680
They see you as a predator.

463
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,140
You're enjoying this,aren't you?

464
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:51,270
Punishing me,danglingthe affair over my head?

465
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,330
Well,I won't tolerate it.

466
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,600
Really?

467
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,180
So just what are yougonna do about it?

468
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,880
I'm gonna let youeven the score.

469
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,730
Carlos,go have an affair.

470
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:09,710
What?

471
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,220
I hadmy little indiscretion.

472
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,330
So you go have yours.Get it out of your system.

473
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:15,100
-I know you want to.
-I do not.

474
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,680
Sure you do.Knock yourself out.

475
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,600
Call up an old college flame.Rent a call girl.

476
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,840
Fly to africa

477
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,400
and nail that little nunyou've been drooling over.

478
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,940
I don't care!

479
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,790
You're crazy.

480
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,410
No,I'm pragmatic.

481
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,240
Because onceyou finish your fling,

482
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,770
we'll be equals again.

483
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,220
And then you won'tbe able to judge me.

484
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,190
And we cango back to being

485
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:40,620
a boring,averagemarried couple.

486
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,240
Oh,just do me a favor.Don't bring back 
any diseases.

487
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,430
Are you sure you're notoverreacting

488
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,590
to this wholegabrielle thing?

489
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,930
Maybe.

490
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,680
Yes.

491
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,680
But gaby doesn't thinkshe did anything wrong.

492
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,500
That's not right,either.

493
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,420
I guess.

494
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,830
You'rean attractive man.

495
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:11,930
There is a primal need fora woman to 
protect what is hers.

496
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:15,360
My initial impulsewas justified.

497
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,640
So you really thinkshe's into me?

498
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,120
I don't know.

499
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:25,470
Because you're right.I am an attractive man.

500
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:27,200
You know what?I've never told you this,

501
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,570
but sometimes when I bend downto pick up 
the morning paper,

502
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:33,180
I catch bree van de kampchecking me out.

503
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,020
You're kidding.

504
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:36,020
No,scout's honor.

505
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,740
I've always exuded a certain sexual magnetism,

506
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:40,150
and as I get older,

507
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,810
I think it's onlybecoming more intense.

508
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,130
Are you drunk?

509
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:46,240
Oh,I'm a hot guyliving in a neighborhood

510
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,700
filled with nothingbut lonely ladies.

511
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,250
Oh.

512
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:53,990
They can't help themselves.I'm like... catnip.

513
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,520
Come here.

514
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,140
What was that for?

515
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,740
Thank you.Thank you for reminding me

516
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,960
that I am the only womanin the whole world

517
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,810
who could lovean idiot like you.

518
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,870
-I'll talk to gaby.
-I'm telling you,

519
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,620
-these women want me.
-Oh,yeah.

520
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:14,110
They see the rippling musclesunderneath 
this t-shirt...

521
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,730
good night,tom.

522
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,390
They cannot resist me.

523
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:19,180
Shut up and go to sleep.

524
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,610
aah!

525
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:18,790
son of a bitch.

526
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,630
you gotta be kidding me.

527
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,200
Whoa,whoa.

528
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,220
I'm here to help you,caleb.

529
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,520
All right?

530
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,790
Mama's gon' be mad.

531
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,740
Don't you worryabout that.

532
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,630
Moms love me.

533
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,880
All right,let's go.

534
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,020
No!

535
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:04,090
Okay,I'm sorry. I shouldn'thave talked 
to you like that.

536
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,540
Let's start over.

537
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,620
Aah!

538
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,560
Let's go.

539
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,460
I'm warning you,pinhead,

540
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,160
don't you make mecome down there after you.

541
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,590
Come on.

542
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:37,170
Come on!

543
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,470
All right,you asked for it.

544
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:44,110
I'm gonna beat the stupidright out of you.

545
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:07,810
This hit the spot.

546
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,290
caleb?

547
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,730
I didn't do it.

548
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,880
Oh,dear.

549
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:42,900
well,hey there.

550
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:45,180
Hi,karl. Oh!

551
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,470
Oh,um,quick question--

552
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,170
when someone discussesa sensitive situation

553
00:26:51,170 --> 00:26:53,880
with a lawyersuch as yourself,

554
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:57,210
when does attorney/clientconfidentiality kick in?

555
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,570
From the momentthe lawyer's been hired. Why?

556
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,680
Here's a check for $100.

557
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,510
That's enoughfor a retainer,right?

558
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,450
Well,I guess.What's going on,bree?

559
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,580
My son is tryingto blackmail me.

560
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,260
And I want you to stopthe little S.O.B.

561
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,410
Do you thinkyou could do that?

562
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,820
He has an illinois license.

563
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:20,900
It says herehis name is munroe.

564
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,500
Does that namemean anything to you?

565
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:28,700
No,but at leasthe wasn't a policeman.

566
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,790
Poor man.

567
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,770
I hope he didn'tsuffer too much.

568
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,390
mom,are welooking at the same body?

569
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,220
what is it?

570
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,680
As soon as it gets dark,

571
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,900
we get rid of that body.

572
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,500
hey.

573
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,720
Um...

574
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,880
I hope it's okay.Carlos let me in.

575
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,490
Actually,I'm rightin the middle of something,

576
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,620
and I don't knowwhen I'll be done.

577
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,730
I'm just here to sayI am sorry,

578
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:39,860
and I have beena complete idiot.

579
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:44,410
all done.

580
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:52,060
so cute.'Cause it's beautiful!

581
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,600
Is the coast clear?

582
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,430
Yes,it is.We worked it out.

583
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:57,440
No kidding.How'd you manage that one?

584
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,350
Simple. Lynette admittedshe was wrong,
and I agreed.

585
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,040
Well,99% wrong.

586
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,250
Oh,whatever,close enough.

587
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:09,160
Anyway,tom's probably gotdinner ready by now.

588
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,960
So I should get goin'.

589
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,070
Okay.

590
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:15,200
Good night.Bye! Mwah!

591
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,960
You knowwhat the 1% is,right?

592
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,650
No,not really.

593
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,810
Does it matter?

594
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,050
It kinda does.

595
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:30,000
I wanna get it clearfor our friendship.

596
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,830
Okay.

597
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,840
What's the 1%?

598
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,870
Well,well...

599
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,790
yes,I overreacted.

600
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,260
I think you can see

601
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:42,410
how even thoughI was somewhat off base,

602
00:29:42,410 --> 00:29:45,780
you were a little wrong,right?

603
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:50,080
No. I kissed tom,and it was a harmless joke.

604
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,820
I think if I had kissedanybody else's husband,

605
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,670
they would've laughed

606
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:55,550
and then forgot about itten seconds later.

607
00:29:55,550 --> 00:30:00,000
Okay,let's test that theory.

608
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:06,950
See? I don't care.

609
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:12,760
That'S...just a waste of time...

610
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:16,260
and spit.

611
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,010
Oh. Okay.

612
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,830
Okay,okay,okay.

613
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,440
Okay! Okay!

614
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,930
I get your point.

615
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:28,330
All righty,then,my work here is done.

616
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,630
Carlos,gaby.

617
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,560
go!

618
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,650
Not bad.

619
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,730
Hey,there he is.

620
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,150
Zach,I'm gladyou could make it.

621
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,770
Hey,zach.

622
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,660
Mr. Delfino,I didn't knowyou were gonna be here.

623
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,640
Yeah,I was just bowling a fewframes and 
ran into these guys.

624
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,440
I thought I might join you.Is,uh,that okay?

625
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:01,040
Yeah,I guess.

626
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,270
Oh!

627
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:09,220
Okay,write that down--nine!

628
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,390
Wise guy.

629
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,050
All right,just roll itin there nice and easy.

630
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:24,880
Sorry.

631
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,600
It's okay.We're still close.

632
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,850
Anyway,julie's totally gonna choke.

633
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,310
Just for that,I am notbringing you back a hot dog.

634
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,810
Zach,do you want one?

635
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:34,450
Okay.

636
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,330
You okay?

637
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,020
Yeah,I'm fine,it's just...

638
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,600
I don't understandwhat you're doing.

639
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:52,830
What do you mean?

640
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:55,180
Well,I don't understand whyyou're being so 
nice to me.

641
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:59,100
I mean,I pointed a gunat you guys. You should 
hate me.

642
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,060
We don't hate you,zach.

643
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,480
You hadan incredibly hard year.

644
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,940
And you shouldn't have donewhat you did,

645
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,350
but we just wannahelp you move on.

646
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,820
Look,um...

647
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,610
when I was young,

648
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,490
I got mixed upin some really bad stuff.

649
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:17,110
I even did some time in prison.

650
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,850
-Really?
-Yeah,but when I got out,

651
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,680
peoplewere willing to forgive me.

652
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,480
Everybody deserves a second chance.

653
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,830
Thanks.

654
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:29,020
You know,I'm gonna go,uh,help julie with the food.

655
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,340
So you guys just keep talkingand bowling.

656
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,350
Talk and bowl.

657
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,480
Bowl and talk.

658
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,110
Here,let meshow you something.

659
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,510
See the arrowsright in the middle?

660
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,770
Just roll it straight over the one in the center.
Okay.

661
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,870
You don't have to spin itor anything.

662
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,890
Just right down the middle.

663
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:52,460
Look at that!

664
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,880
Good job.

665
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,590
Hurry up!

666
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:04,300
I am hurrying up,okay?

667
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,080
Wait,no! No! No!

668
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:07,930
-What?
-I dropped the keys.

669
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:11,240
I don't have 'em.They're in here!

670
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:26,600
sometimes you just have to laugh.

671
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,980
andrew?

672
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:40,330
Would you mindturning off your video game?

673
00:33:40,330 --> 00:33:44,070
My lawyer would liketo have a little chat 
with you.

674
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,480
So even though your mother did witnessgeorge 
williams' suicide,

675
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,460
there's no affirmative dutyto intervene.

676
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,040
Therefore,no crime was committed.

677
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,890
Even if the police find out,

678
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:58,490
your mom will never seethe inside of a courtroom.

679
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:01,660
Well,maybe I gotthe story wrong.

680
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:06,030
What if she went over thereto help him 
commit suicide?

681
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:08,270
If you wanna lie to the police,go right ahead.

682
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,990
But please knowthat I will sue you.

683
00:34:10,990 --> 00:34:11,780
For what?

684
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,140
Abuse of process.

685
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:15,260
It's when a person triesto exploit the 
legal system

686
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,870
for an improper purpose--like blackmail.

687
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,730
You guys can't sue me.I'm just a kid.

688
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:22,330
Oh,don't worry.

689
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,750
I won't start garnishingyour wages until 
you turn 18.

690
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,700
Your mom--is she a peach or what?

691
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,660
If the cops don't give a damn,I'm sure 
your friends will.

692
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:37,260
How does a littlepublic humiliation sound?

693
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,660
Bree,can I geta refill on this?

694
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,690
What are you doing?!

695
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,240
Your fatherwas a friend of mine.

696
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,280
And if he were around to seewhat a nasty 
little turd

697
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,160
you've turned into,he'd knock the hell 
out of you.

698
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,930
Yeah,well,he's not here now,is he?

699
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:03,700
No,he isn't,but if youdon't get your act 
together

700
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,700
and start treating your motherwith some respect,

701
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,910
I'll take careof you myself.

702
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:12,830
Do you understandwhat I'm saying?

703
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,490
Yeah.

704
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,720
Good.

705
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,950
Hey,neighbor.

706
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:27,090
Oh,hey,carlos.

707
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:27,980
Hi.

708
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,260
I just wanted to thank you forpatching 
things up with gaby.

709
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,570
Well,sure,no problem.

710
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,550
It's beenreally tough on her--

711
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:37,040
everybody finding outabout the affair.

712
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,070
Yeah,I can imagine.

713
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,460
I don't mind telling you,it's,uh...

714
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,700
it's been pretty tough on usthe past 
couple months.

715
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,760
Oh,well,I'm not surprised,

716
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,030
and I really,really hopeyou can work it out.

717
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,730
Yeah,we're trying.You know...

718
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:53,450
mm-hmm? Yeah?

719
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:55,680
Gaby hadan interesting suggestion.

720
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,270
Oh?

721
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,260
She told methat I should go out

722
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,800
and have an affairof my own.

723
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,470
She thinksit's the only way

724
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:04,920
I'll be able to get overwhat she did to me

725
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:08,670
and that it just mighthelp our marriage.

726
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,670
Why are youtelling me this?

727
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:11,540
Uh...

728
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,710
I guess I just,uh...

729
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:19,780
wanted to know if you hadany thoughts 
on the subject?

730
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,510
I... don't.

731
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,670
I really don't.

732
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:30,680
Well,if you ever do,let me know.

733
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,870
By the way...

734
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,930
mm-hmm?

735
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:38,560
That was one hellof a kiss you gave me.

736
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:41,870
You can't fakechemistry like that.

737
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,730
What the hell is this?

738
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:29,520
Delfino?

739
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,310
Stay away from my son!

740
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,050
oh,my god!

741
00:37:55,190 --> 00:37:56,180
dad!

742
00:38:00,390 --> 00:38:01,700
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

743
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:03,620
Aah!

744
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,740
so I squirm to avoid hitting his car

745
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,780
and I hit parker instead

746
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,760
and that's from the trunk top open

747
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,440
when we got out

748
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,800
we found this dead body

749
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,100
are you worried now

750
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,790
'cause I am

751
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:44,240
not yet

752
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,530
let's be patient, see what will happens

753
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,170
how'd go

754
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,720
well I told them everything I know

755
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,900
which wasnt much

756
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,620
so we thinking this is paul

757
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,990
well he's our friendly neighborhood murderer

758
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,310
yes it seems obvious

759
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,460
I dont know

760
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,480
I saw his face when he looked into the trunk

761
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,500
and he looked just as shocked as I was

762
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,830
I'm thinking it was the Applewhites

763
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,390
I talked to the dead guy

764
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:12,200
He said he was doing appraisal on their house

765
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,740
I got a little cheesed

766
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,940
so i called all the realtors in town

767
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,600
nobody had even heard of him

768
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,130
that doesnt mean Betty knew him

769
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:21,840
please

770
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,510
those two were fishy

771
00:39:23,510 --> 00:39:25,720
they bought that house sightn unseen

772
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,690
and they did move in the middle of the night

773
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:31,440
and there were noises

774
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,700
what noises

775
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,830
a couple weeks ago

776
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,520
I heard some noises coming

777
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,030
from the basement like cleaning

778
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:39,900
I asked betty about it

779
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,630
she lied right to my face

780
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,380
what's that about

781
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:45,990
I dont know

782
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,710
now I am worried

783
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:17,750
Julie

784
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,230
hi

785
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,360
hi

786
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,340
well my dad found out about us bowling

787
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,430
I cannot be able to do that anytime soon

788
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:32,510
oh,sorry

789
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:33,940
no no I'm glad we did

790
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:37,580
I havent felt like a part of a family in 
a long time

791
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,540
thanks

792
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,020
I'd better go back inside

793
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,500
the act itself never varies

794
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:55,780
but each kiss carries a with it
a meaning all it's own

795
00:40:55,780 --> 00:41:01,280
it can convey a husband's eternal devotion

796
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,600
or a wife's enormous regret

797
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:13,690
it can symbolize a mother's growing concern

798
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:20,490
or a lover's growing passion

799
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:24,070
but whatever its meaning

800
00:41:24,070 --> 00:41:27,840
each kiss

801
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:31,160
reflects a basic human need

802
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:41,270
the needs to connect to another human being

803
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:46,440
this desire is so strong

804
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,080
it's always amazing when some people

805
00:41:51,270 --> 00:41:52,850
dont understand it
