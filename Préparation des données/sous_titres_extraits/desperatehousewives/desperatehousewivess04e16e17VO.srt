1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,738
Previously on...

2
00:00:02,738 --> 00:00:05,487
Adam was finished
with katherine...

3
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:09,831
Please get rid of that gum.
But dylan's father came back.

4
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:11,237
Bye, sweetheart.
Bye, dad.

5
00:00:11,237 --> 00:00:13,863
I tricked you into
thinking dylan was yours.

6
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:16,862
I finished that d.N.A.
You wanted, and your suspect's

7
00:00:16,862 --> 00:00:18,562
Not related
to the victim at all.

8
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:21,328
Gaby and carlos were forced
to go to the police.

9
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:25,728
Are you sure it was cocaine? Carlos, i was
a fashion model in the '90s. I know cocaine.

10
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:28,528
Just give me what i want...
and lynette...

11
00:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,662
Or you're not
gonna like what happens.

12
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:33,728
...was pushed
to her breaking point.

13
00:00:36,728 --> 00:00:39,628
Coffee mugs to the contrary,

14
00:00:39,662 --> 00:00:41,378
Lynette scavo knew

15
00:00:41,378 --> 00:00:44,695
That she was not
the world's greatest mother.

16
00:00:45,203 --> 00:00:47,695
In fact,
when it came to parenting,

17
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:51,562
Lynette had done many things
she was not proud of...

18
00:00:53,175 --> 00:00:55,940
Like the time
when she offered parker cash

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,361
If he agreed
to eat all of his spinach...

20
00:00:59,488 --> 00:01:00,863
Or when she told the twins

21
00:01:00,863 --> 00:01:03,999
There was treasure
buried beneath the weeds...

22
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:09,112
Or when she gave her kids
a little extra cough syrup

23
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,222
So she could finish her novel.

24
00:01:12,029 --> 00:01:14,828
But despite these lapses...

25
00:01:14,862 --> 00:01:17,362
Lynette didn't think of herself

26
00:01:17,362 --> 00:01:19,363
As the worst mother
in the world either,

27
00:01:20,188 --> 00:01:22,675
Until one horrible day.

28
00:01:22,675 --> 00:01:24,762
Since when
do you make waffles?

29
00:01:24,795 --> 00:01:26,800
Well, kayla loves waffles,

30
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,929
And since she and i have been
having some problems lately,

31
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:31,695
I wanted to do
something nice for her.

32
00:01:31,728 --> 00:01:34,695
Oh, you tell kayla
her breakfast is ready.

33
00:01:36,328 --> 00:01:38,695
Hi.
My name is fern parrish.

34
00:01:38,728 --> 00:01:40,762
This is my colleague,
irene semanis.

35
00:01:40,795 --> 00:01:44,331
We're from c.P.S. Uh, one
sec. Preston, you might wanna

36
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:45,987
Stop dropping your waffle
on the floor,

37
00:01:45,987 --> 00:01:48,238
'Cause i'm still
gonna make you eat it.

38
00:01:48,929 --> 00:01:51,862
So, uh, what's c.P.S.?

39
00:01:51,895 --> 00:01:53,828
Children's
protective services.

40
00:01:55,363 --> 00:01:57,862
For what it's worth, i keep
my floors incredibly clean.

41
00:01:57,895 --> 00:02:00,300
Mrs. Scavo,
we recently received

42
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,925
A report of some abuse
in your home.

43
00:02:01,925 --> 00:02:04,863
Abuse? That's ridiculous.

44
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:08,113
Well, we got a call
from a dr. Joshua dolan?

45
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:10,228
It seems he was contacted
by your daughter kayla.

46
00:02:10,261 --> 00:02:13,261
Who says you hit her...
repeatedly.

47
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,361
Okay...

48
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,660
First,
i'm not that kind of mom.

49
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,461
And second,

50
00:02:20,495 --> 00:02:24,261
Kayla has a tendency
to... exaggerate.

51
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:27,395
We also have a security tape
from a clothing store.

52
00:02:27,428 --> 00:02:30,795
It shows you slapping
a young girl across the face.

53
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:33,662
We're assuming that's kayla.

54
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,800
Have a seat.
I'll be with you in a second.

55
00:02:45,112 --> 00:02:49,795
Yes, lynette scavo was not
the world's greatest mother.

56
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,361
But in her heart,

57
00:02:52,395 --> 00:02:55,895
She knew she had done
the best she could...

58
00:02:57,191 --> 00:02:58,261
Given...

59
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:01,495
What she had to work with.

63
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:16,316
"Lynette"-

64
00:03:16,316 --> 00:03:19,962
It's how the french describe
"a pretty one."

65
00:03:20,612 --> 00:03:21,595
"Katherine"-

66
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,762
Coined by the ancient greeks,
it denotes "purity."

67
00:03:26,795 --> 00:03:28,328
"Gabrielle"-

68
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:32,929
A hebrew word meaning
"god is my strength."

69
00:03:33,754 --> 00:03:35,061
"Bree"-

70
00:03:35,094 --> 00:03:38,962
It's an irish name
that means "power."

71
00:03:39,894 --> 00:03:41,228
Indeed...

72
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:45,528
Every name has
a single specific meaning...

73
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:51,581
Which is why parents
have trouble choosing one

74
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,128
For someone
who means everything to them.

75
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:57,061
What about "philip"?
I like "philip."

76
00:03:57,094 --> 00:03:59,128
Oh, i know you do.

77
00:03:59,161 --> 00:04:00,995
I don't,
and neither does the baby.

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,228
Philip? Oh, phil?

79
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:05,728
See? Nothing.
Not even a burp.

80
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,695
Here's a thought.

81
00:04:07,728 --> 00:04:10,628
How about "nathaniel"? All
right, that's the fourth time

82
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:12,566
You've tried to sneak
"nathaniel" past me.

83
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:17,395
I'm putting "peyton" back on the table. I
am not naming my son after a quarterback.

84
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,962
All right,
here's the rest of my list.

85
00:04:19,995 --> 00:04:22,795
Lucas.
It sounds like "mucus."

86
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,113
Mitchum.
Like the deodorant?

87
00:04:25,862 --> 00:04:26,495
Unitas.

88
00:04:26,528 --> 00:04:28,237
Oh, give me that.

89
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,361
Well,
we need new inspiration.

90
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:34,728
Ooh.

91
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:35,995
Riley.

92
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:37,995
I like it. Who is he?

93
00:04:38,029 --> 00:04:40,194
He's a guy who...

94
00:04:40,228 --> 00:04:42,706
"Killed six, then self."

95
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:46,695
Well, i give up.

96
00:04:46,728 --> 00:04:49,662
He's not gonna get a name.
When we want him to come,

97
00:04:49,695 --> 00:04:51,962
We'll just whistle and say,
"here, boy."

98
00:04:51,995 --> 00:04:54,925
Dr. Conner.
Paging dr. Conner.

99
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:57,094
Please call admitting.
Conner.

100
00:04:57,128 --> 00:04:58,925
I love it.

101
00:04:58,925 --> 00:05:01,112
Me, too.

102
00:05:01,828 --> 00:05:04,595
Oh,
you finally have a name.

103
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:07,161
Dr. Conner delfino.

104
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,737
Oh, hey.
I'm going out to the mall.

105
00:05:12,737 --> 00:05:13,495
You wanna come with?

106
00:05:13,528 --> 00:05:14,728
Oh, no, thanks.

107
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:17,361
I gotta make sure my handyman
gets his wiring done.

108
00:05:17,395 --> 00:05:19,175
He screwed it up
the last time.

109
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,495
You realize
we could've had a fire?

110
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:23,828
Sorry, mrs. Solis.

111
00:05:24,753 --> 00:05:26,662
All right, then.
See you later.

112
00:05:31,895 --> 00:05:34,706
And... she's gone.

113
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:37,562
Great.
Let's break into her room.

114
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:42,862
As soon i finish this,

115
00:05:42,862 --> 00:05:44,728
I'll start placing bugs
in the other rooms.

116
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,628
Well,
isn't her room enough?

117
00:05:46,662 --> 00:05:49,595
She has a prepaid cell phone,
so we can't tap it.

118
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,300
Our only hope
at nailing her supplier

119
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,237
Is to record every conversation
she has in this house.

120
00:05:54,237 --> 00:05:58,261
Well, how long is that gonna take? We got a
tip that she's expecting a delivery this week.

121
00:05:58,295 --> 00:06:00,999
So it won't be long before
miss leonard learns the joys

122
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:04,094
Of a little girl-On-Girl action
in a prison shower.

123
00:06:04,953 --> 00:06:06,816
Okay, first of all,
you're a pig.

124
00:06:06,816 --> 00:06:09,613
Second of all, don't say things
like that. Ellie's my friend.

125
00:06:09,613 --> 00:06:12,862
Yeah, well, your friend is
a drug dealer, i. E., scum.

126
00:06:13,191 --> 00:06:15,328
Hey!
You don't even know her.

127
00:06:15,361 --> 00:06:18,050
Okay, yes,
she's made some bad choices,

128
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,815
But deep down,
she's a good person.

129
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:22,565
Yeah, well, deep down,
i hope she rots in jail.

130
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:23,999
Okay,
when this thing is over,

131
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,253
Let's not do the whole
christmas card thing.

132
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:30,795
Is that your husband?
No, he's at braille school.

133
00:06:37,425 --> 00:06:37,962
Gaby?

134
00:06:37,995 --> 00:06:40,662
Oh, ellie! Hey!

135
00:06:40,695 --> 00:06:43,128
What the hell are you
doing in my room?!

136
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:46,175
We weren't expecting you back
so soon. I forgot my wallet.

137
00:06:46,175 --> 00:06:47,987
Again,what the hell
are you doing in my room?

138
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:52,528
Well, we needed some privacy.
See, roy and i are lovers.

139
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,925
You're having an affair
with your handyman?

140
00:06:55,925 --> 00:06:59,295
I know, it's crazy. You wouldn't
believe the passion.

141
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:02,925
I mean,
i was powerless to resist.

142
00:07:03,795 --> 00:07:05,728
Just-
Just get out of my room.

143
00:07:05,762 --> 00:07:08,295
Okay, okay. We're going.

144
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:16,161
That's for
using your tongue.

145
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,628
Lots of people
do missionary work,

146
00:07:20,628 --> 00:07:23,762
But few have the guts to smuggle
bibles into north korea.

147
00:07:23,795 --> 00:07:25,362
It is my distinct pleasure

148
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,495
To welcome back,
after four long years-

149
00:07:28,528 --> 00:07:29,728
Reverend michael green.

150
00:07:33,762 --> 00:07:36,695
Thank you for that
glorious introduction, joe.

151
00:07:36,728 --> 00:07:40,161
Well, it's good to be back.
Now if you'll all please stand

152
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,194
And offer each other
the lord's peace.

153
00:07:47,728 --> 00:07:49,695
Peace be with you, bree.

154
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:52,895
I reject your peace, and i
demand you stop stalking me.

155
00:07:52,929 --> 00:07:54,999
I'm doing no such thing.

156
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:57,300
Really? So i just happen to run
into you at the dry cleaner,

157
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,456
The greengrocer, the post
office? We shared a life together.

158
00:08:00,456 --> 00:08:04,237
It's only natural we'd frequent the same
places. Oh, please. I saw you at my nail salon.

159
00:08:04,237 --> 00:08:06,112
There's nothing in the bible
that says a man

160
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:11,061
Can't enjoy a nice pedicure. Orson,
hear me when i say this. It's over.

161
00:08:11,972 --> 00:08:13,728
You have done
unconscionable things

162
00:08:13,762 --> 00:08:15,628
For which
i can never forgive you,

163
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,831
And no amount of flitting about
in my peripheral vision

164
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,175
Is going to change that. But
there must be something i can do.

165
00:08:21,175 --> 00:08:24,113
You know i've repented.
We-We can get past this.

166
00:08:24,113 --> 00:08:26,295
I know
no such thing. Now be quiet.

167
00:08:26,328 --> 00:08:27,300
I'm done talking to you.

168
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,461
Bree, so nice to see you again.
Peace be with you.

169
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,194
And also with you.

170
00:08:33,228 --> 00:08:35,662
Do not give this man peace.

171
00:08:40,238 --> 00:08:43,550
You shouldn't keep
your doors unlocked, kathy.

172
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:48,929
Why do you think they call 'em
"crimes of opportunity"?

173
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,261
What do you want?

174
00:08:54,695 --> 00:08:58,362
Dylan used to have
a big old scar right here,

175
00:08:58,362 --> 00:08:59,528
And now it's gone.

176
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,728
I'm just curious

177
00:09:02,738 --> 00:09:05,029
How you would explain that.

178
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,128
Never too early
to start drinking, is it?

179
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:12,300
She fell off her bike.
11 stitches. I remember.

180
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:19,362
I took her to a plastic surgeon
in chicago

181
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:21,863
'Cause i didn't want her
to feel self-Conscious.

182
00:09:21,863 --> 00:09:24,175
Well,
that's pretty convenient.

183
00:09:24,688 --> 00:09:26,194
What are you suggesting,
wayne?

184
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,061
Something's not right.

185
00:09:28,094 --> 00:09:30,995
I felt it from the moment
that i laid eyes on her.

186
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,795
I just don't see myself
in her at all.

187
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:36,962
I told you.
She's not yours.

188
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:40,628
Yeah, but i don't see you
in her either.

189
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,295
So...

190
00:09:44,394 --> 00:09:46,094
Let's just settle this
once and for all.

191
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:50,428
Take a d.N.A. Test. All i need
is one strand of hair.

192
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:52,728
Knock, knock.
Is this a bad time?

193
00:09:53,504 --> 00:09:56,728
No, not at all.
Great, because we are here

194
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,753
To throw ourselves
on your mercy.

195
00:09:58,753 --> 00:10:00,738
We are having a commitment
ceremony in five days,

196
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:03,728
And our caterer just canceled.
We know it's short notice.

197
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:07,495
Totally understand if you say
no. Nonsense. I'd love to do it.

198
00:10:07,925 --> 00:10:10,361
Why don't you have a seat,
and we'll talk details?

199
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:14,828
I'm sorry. If... you're busy,
we can come back later.

200
00:10:14,862 --> 00:10:17,962
No, no. No, that's okay.
You stay.

201
00:10:17,995 --> 00:10:20,295
I'll come back later.

202
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:25,461
Lynette, i'm sorry.

203
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,895
When i'm told about
a suspected case of child abuse,

204
00:10:27,929 --> 00:10:29,862
I am bound by law
to report it.

205
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,828
Okay, so what happens now?

206
00:10:31,862 --> 00:10:34,995
I'm just trying to help c.P.S.
Finish their investigation.

207
00:10:35,029 --> 00:10:37,862
They'll interview your kids,
their teachers,

208
00:10:37,895 --> 00:10:39,728
Possibly
some of your neighbors.

209
00:10:39,762 --> 00:10:43,562
My neighbors? God!
I could strangle that girl.

210
00:10:43,595 --> 00:10:46,487
Honey, you might wanna stop
saying things like that.

211
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:49,695
Look, for the next few days,
let tom handle the kids.

212
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:52,194
Any other problems
between you and kayla

213
00:10:52,228 --> 00:10:54,962
Could jeopardize custody
of all your children.

214
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:58,238
Wait. They could take
my children?

215
00:10:58,238 --> 00:11:00,962
No one's taking anyone. You
have got to be kidding me!

216
00:11:00,995 --> 00:11:02,675
This is all
a big misunderstanding.

217
00:11:02,675 --> 00:11:06,862
I'm sure that we can work this out. So
what do i need to do to keep my kids?

218
00:11:06,895 --> 00:11:09,995
Well, there are
a lot of things you can do.

219
00:11:10,029 --> 00:11:11,828
First,
no physical discipline...

220
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:32,113
???

221
00:11:32,113 --> 00:11:34,253
Of the onion
and white asparagus tart.

222
00:11:34,253 --> 00:11:36,315
Wonderful!
With a little goat cheese.

223
00:11:36,315 --> 00:11:39,300
Oh, and lee asked
for stuffed mushrooms.

224
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:43,495
Those with roasted green beans
as our side dishes.

225
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,295
Nice tight grouping.
You are not rusty at all.

226
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:50,994
Thank you. Felt good.

227
00:11:51,028 --> 00:11:53,328
Although i always, uh,
like a trip to the range,

228
00:11:53,361 --> 00:11:55,941
Is there any particular reason
we came here for party planning?

229
00:11:55,941 --> 00:11:57,238
Well, with adam gone,

230
00:11:57,238 --> 00:12:00,661
I've just been feeling
a little... uneasy lately.

231
00:12:00,694 --> 00:12:01,800
It's funny how
having a man in the house

232
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,988
Can make you feel safer,

233
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,300
No matter how retiring
or easily spooked he might be.

234
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:09,925
That's true. I just need to feel
that if an intruder broke in,

235
00:12:09,925 --> 00:12:13,994
I could take care of it...
effectively.

236
00:12:14,028 --> 00:12:16,462
You really want
to be effective?

237
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:18,050
Try hollow points.

238
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,800
These rounds you've got
punch straight though,

239
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,161
But a hollow point
blooms on impact,

240
00:12:23,195 --> 00:12:25,862
Cuts the body to shreds
from the inside.

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,737
Sounds exactly
like what i need.

242
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,441
Now...

243
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,878
Let's talk desserts.

244
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,362
???????My grandie died.

245
00:12:47,362 --> 00:12:50,581
Oh, som so sorry.

246
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:53,050
I know
muw much lou lovim him.

247
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:55,361
Welltuactu,ly,i'
bve been thinkingutboutt.

248
00:12:55,395 --> 00:12:56,800
I kn
wetlet oed"cn "cr,ner,"

249
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,738
But ud, ih, lik like toeam
r our son after ra grandfather

250
00:13:01,625 --> 00:13:02,613
Oh.

251
00:13:02,613 --> 00:13:05,425
Well, yeah, um,

252
00:13:05,425 --> 00:13:08,988
I mean, "conner" ????

253
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:12,228
This would mean something.
So you're okay with this?

254
00:13:12,261 --> 00:13:15,253
I think it's a beautiful way
to honor your grandfather.

255
00:13:15,253 --> 00:13:16,894
I mean, "james" wouldn't
be my first choice,

256
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:19,363
But it's a good, solid name.

257
00:13:19,363 --> 00:13:21,112
No, grandpa james is
my dad's dad.

258
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:23,410
This is my mom's-Maynard.

259
00:13:24,812 --> 00:13:26,816
Oh, right. Maynard.

260
00:13:29,453 --> 00:13:31,175
Oh, that's awful...

261
00:13:31,175 --> 00:13:33,269
That he died. Why didn't
we think of this before?

262
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:35,487
It's such
a beautiful southern name.

263
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:38,238
Oh, and rare,

264
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:39,737
Really rare.

265
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:42,738
And you're right. It's a great
way to honor my grandfather.

266
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,425
Yeah.

267
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:46,378
I said that, didn't i?

268
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,238
Oh, shoot. We can't do it.
Isn't your grandpa james

269
00:13:50,238 --> 00:13:52,173
Significantly older
than grandpa maynard?

270
00:13:52,205 --> 00:13:53,612
Shouldn't we honor him
first?

271
00:13:53,612 --> 00:13:56,613
But grandpa james
isn't dead.

272
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:59,073
You sure?
It's worth a phone call.

273
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,893
Actually, i've got a cousin
who's named after him already,

274
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:02,503
So we're covered.

275
00:14:03,487 --> 00:14:06,675
Thank you, susan.
This really means a lot.

276
00:14:07,112 --> 00:14:08,362
I'm gonna go call my mom.

277
00:14:10,422 --> 00:14:11,550
Oh.

278
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:13,925
Forgive me.

279
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,999
Don't look at me like that.
His grandfather just died.

280
00:14:21,173 --> 00:14:23,539
Hey! Lunch is almost ready.

281
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,238
I'm making your favorite.

282
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:31,872
I take it
you're still mad at me.

283
00:14:31,906 --> 00:14:35,405
Well, yeah. I just don't get
why you broke into my room.

284
00:14:35,439 --> 00:14:38,006
Well, i couldn't risk
doing it in my room.

285
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,363
Ever since carlos went blind,

286
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:41,691
He's developed
a strong sense of smell.

287
00:14:41,691 --> 00:14:43,112
I don't know if you happened
to catch a whiff of roy,

288
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:45,613
But that is
one telltale odor.

289
00:14:45,613 --> 00:14:47,879
Well, that's another thing,
you know?

290
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:49,878
What do you see in that guy?

291
00:14:51,305 --> 00:14:54,272
Uh, you know,
he's a handyman.

292
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:56,039
He knows how to...

293
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:59,073
Get in there...
and make stuff work.

294
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:00,839
But he's a zero,

295
00:15:00,872 --> 00:15:02,806
And carlos is so fantastic.

296
00:15:03,629 --> 00:15:04,906
Don't you love him?

297
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:06,472
Of course i do.

298
00:15:06,505 --> 00:15:08,906
Carlos solis
is the love of my life.

299
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:13,739
But, you know,
sometimes you get bored,

300
00:15:13,772 --> 00:15:17,906
And a big, greasy,
disgusting handyman

301
00:15:17,939 --> 00:15:19,739
Really hits the spot.

302
00:15:34,872 --> 00:15:37,972
Adam, what the-
You scared me half to death.

303
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,987
Sorry. I let myself in.

304
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,237
Why?

305
00:15:43,237 --> 00:15:46,238
Dylan told me wayne's back.

306
00:15:46,238 --> 00:15:48,238
Why didn't you call me?
Because i'm handling it.

307
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,872
Yeah, she told me about
the shooting range, too.

308
00:15:49,906 --> 00:15:51,613
You sure that's
the best way to handle it?

309
00:15:51,613 --> 00:15:55,372
Adam, you made it very clear
that you were done with me.

310
00:15:55,405 --> 00:15:57,190
But i'm not done with dylan,

311
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:59,503
And if wayne's back,
then i'm gonna protect her.

312
00:15:59,503 --> 00:16:02,800
So maybe i should pay him
a little visit, scare him off.

313
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:06,972
If you'd ever met wayne,
you'd know better.

314
00:16:08,487 --> 00:16:10,006
Well, then
let's get dylan out of town.

315
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:12,405
I tried.
She said she's not leaving.

316
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:16,505
Well, i...

317
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:18,572
I promised her
a trip for graduation,

318
00:16:18,605 --> 00:16:22,272
Just the three of us,
anywhere she wanted to go.

319
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:26,237
Okay. But what happens
when the trip's over?

320
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:28,106
Won't we just be
at square one again?

321
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,872
Not if we don't come back.

322
00:16:34,362 --> 00:16:36,039
Oh, susan. He's adorable.

323
00:16:36,073 --> 00:16:38,738
He's so precious.
So it's been two days now.

324
00:16:38,738 --> 00:16:41,425
Did you and mike
finally land on a name?

325
00:16:42,999 --> 00:16:43,872
Maynard.

326
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,393
Maynard?

327
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:53,800
Wow. Interesting.

328
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,872
It has
a very distinct ring.

329
00:16:55,906 --> 00:16:57,972
Okay, drop the act, ladies.
I hate it, too.

330
00:16:58,006 --> 00:17:01,675
Mike insisted that we name him after
his dead grandfather. How did he die?

331
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,806
Was he beaten to death 'cause his name
was maynard? I know. It's terrible,

332
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,300
But i can't change it now.
Mike was so emotional about it.

333
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,737
Well, then appeal
to his sense of reason,

334
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,565
Because the name "maynard"

335
00:17:11,565 --> 00:17:12,737
Doesn't go
with the name of "delfino."

336
00:17:12,737 --> 00:17:15,050
One is german
and the other is italian,

337
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:19,566
And we all know what happens when those folks get
together. Well, i'm not sure that the world war ii argument

338
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,550
Is gonna fly. Come on.
You have to do something.

339
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:25,050
I mean, that name is practically
abusive. Yeah, think about your son.

340
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,738
People live up
to the names they're given.

341
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:28,800
If my parents
hadn't named me "gabrielle,"

342
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,503
Who knows if i'd be this pretty? I guess
that's why they didn't name you "einstein."

343
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:35,644
So sarcastic, but what would
you expect from a "lynette"?

344
00:17:35,862 --> 00:17:37,878
What? If your name
was "francesca,"

345
00:17:37,878 --> 00:17:38,999
You wouldn't have time
for sarcasm.

346
00:17:38,999 --> 00:17:45,006
You'd be too busy having sex on a vespa.
You're right. My son's future is at stake.

347
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,550
I have to do something. Maybe not. We
call gabrielle "gaby." I mean, perhaps

348
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:51,175
There's a shortened version of
"maynard" you could live with.

349
00:17:51,175 --> 00:17:54,300
Yeah. Which says
"kick my ass" less-

350
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,439
"May" or "nerd"?

351
00:18:04,878 --> 00:18:05,706
What's going on?

352
00:18:05,706 --> 00:18:09,806
Lynette scavo, i'm placing you
under arrest. What? Why? Wh-For what?

353
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:12,106
Kayla showed us
the burn mark on her arm.

354
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:15,139
Burn mark? What burn mark? You see?
She doesn't know anything about this.

355
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:17,050
Okay, sir. That's enough. Now please, if
we could just go back and talk about this...

356
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:20,572
Sir, enough! Ma'am, you're gonna
have to come with us. Oh! Tom.

357
00:18:20,605 --> 00:18:24,300
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go call the attorney.
I- Okay. Look, look, i- I will come with you.

358
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,906
Please, just don't handcuff me in front of my
children. Well, you should have thought of that

359
00:18:27,939 --> 00:18:31,300
Before you hurt one of them.
Lynette scavo, you have

360
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,456
The right to remain silent.
If you give up that right,

361
00:18:33,456 --> 00:18:35,175
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

362
00:18:35,175 --> 00:18:36,378
In a court of law.
You have

363
00:18:36,378 --> 00:18:38,863
The right to have an attorney
present during questioning.

364
00:18:38,863 --> 00:18:41,253
If you do not have one,
we will appoint one for you.

365
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:50,439
Well, i'd-I'd be delighted
to speak to them, bree.

366
00:18:50,472 --> 00:18:52,175
Perhaps i can tell 'em
the story

367
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:55,341
About the time i evaded
the north korean border patrol

368
00:18:55,374 --> 00:18:58,341
By hiding
in a pile of oxen dung.

369
00:18:58,374 --> 00:18:59,941
They'll love that.

370
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:02,641
This is gonna be
the best seniors' brunch ever.

371
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,775
I'm so glad you're back.

372
00:19:04,808 --> 00:19:07,113
Between you and me,
reverend sykes tended

373
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:10,708
To pander to the congregation's
progressive element.

374
00:19:10,741 --> 00:19:14,341
I prefer your more muscular
brand of christianity.

375
00:19:14,374 --> 00:19:16,474
Well, thank you, bree.
Hmm.

376
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:18,541
I thought of you also.

377
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,574
I'm so sorry to hear
about rex's passing,

378
00:19:21,608 --> 00:19:24,674
But i understand
that you remarried.

379
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,307
I did, but, um, i'm afraid
it hasn't worked out.

380
00:19:28,341 --> 00:19:29,708
It's been rough.

381
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:32,108
For what it's worth,
i know how you feel.

382
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:34,474
When carolyn left me,

383
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:36,441
The loneliness
was crippling.

384
00:19:36,474 --> 00:19:38,675
I didn't know she left you.

385
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:41,641
Yes, for our korean grocer.

386
00:19:41,674 --> 00:19:43,066
I'll tell you,

387
00:19:43,066 --> 00:19:45,741
Sometimes
this merciful god of ours

388
00:19:45,775 --> 00:19:48,300
Has one sick sense of humor.

389
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,541
Hartman, table for 4, 7:30.

390
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:54,941
See you then. Table for one? Yes.

391
00:19:54,975 --> 00:19:56,674
Scavo's.

392
00:19:57,925 --> 00:19:59,378
Is everything all right?

393
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:00,237
Oh, this is a bit awkward,

394
00:20:00,237 --> 00:20:02,641
But my soon-To-Be ex
just walked in.

395
00:20:02,674 --> 00:20:05,775
He's been following me everywhere.
For ace, 8:30 p.M. All right.

396
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,878
Would you mind terribly
if i took your hand?

397
00:20:08,878 --> 00:20:12,307
Maybe that way, he'll finally
get the idea that i've moved on.

398
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,508
My hand is at your service.

399
00:20:17,175 --> 00:20:18,441
Right this way, sir.

400
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:20,808
Will you be needing
a wine list?

401
00:20:22,374 --> 00:20:24,608
Uh...

402
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,274
Actually, i...

403
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,875
Think i'll be needing
a new restaurant.

404
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:34,269
Ah, it worked.

405
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:36,374
Thank you for that.

406
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:39,112
It was my pleasure.

407
00:20:40,142 --> 00:20:43,142
The bail bondsman said
he has to run a credit check,

408
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:46,208
Then he'll wire the money.
So after you've been processed,

409
00:20:46,242 --> 00:20:47,425
You can leave.

410
00:20:47,425 --> 00:20:48,999
And go where?

411
00:20:48,999 --> 00:20:52,108
I can't get within 500 feet
of my children.

412
00:20:52,142 --> 00:20:55,841
Are you not up to speed on
the people vs. Lynette scavo?

413
00:20:55,875 --> 00:20:57,407
We'll figure something out.

414
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:59,708
Mrs. Scavo,
it's time to go.

415
00:20:59,741 --> 00:21:02,175
No, you'll figure
something out.

416
00:21:02,175 --> 00:21:03,808
I have to go back
to my cell.

417
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:07,274
Honey, i am so sorry ahiut tbos.
Look it, just hang in there.

418
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:10,341
It's only gonna be
a couple more hours at the most.

419
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:14,941
How can you talk like that?

420
00:21:14,975 --> 00:21:18,242
What else has to happen for you
to get what's going on here?

421
00:21:18,274 --> 00:21:19,474
I do get it.

422
00:21:19,508 --> 00:21:22,508
But kayla's my daughter,
so i'm trying to deal with this

423
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,541
In a way
that protects our family.

424
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,041
No, you are trying
to stay on the fence

425
00:21:27,075 --> 00:21:29,541
While i fight to stop kayla
from destroying us.

426
00:21:29,574 --> 00:21:32,674
But look around you, tom.
Look where i am!

427
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:36,341
You have got
to do something now.

428
00:21:36,374 --> 00:21:38,975
Fix this.

429
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,908
Well, thank you
for a lovely evening, bree.

430
00:21:52,941 --> 00:21:55,908
Oh. You know, it's funny.
I don't think i'll be able

431
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:58,407
To look at you as just
another parishioner anymore.

432
00:21:59,394 --> 00:22:01,675
Now, now.
We mustn't play favorites,

433
00:22:01,675 --> 00:22:03,242
Although i will take that
as a compliment.

434
00:22:03,274 --> 00:22:06,674
Well, take this
as a compliment as well.

435
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,474
Your eyes glimmer

436
00:22:08,508 --> 00:22:11,307
Like the yalu river
on a moonlit night.

437
00:22:12,488 --> 00:22:14,112
Oh.

438
00:22:14,112 --> 00:22:16,832
How, um, colorfully put.

439
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,987
???????????

440
00:22:18,987 --> 00:22:19,908
What does that mean?

441
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:22,307
I want you.

442
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:26,268
Reverend green! When you took
my hand in that restaurant,

443
00:22:26,268 --> 00:22:29,190
I could feel the electricity, and i
know you felt it, too. No, i told you.

444
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,940
I was only trying
to send a message to my ex.

445
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,190
Oh, please. There's always been
sexual tension between us,

446
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:37,363
Ever since palm sunday 1996,

447
00:22:37,363 --> 00:22:40,238
When we both reached
for the same frond. No!

448
00:22:40,238 --> 00:22:42,643
Bree, if i took no
for an answer,

449
00:22:42,643 --> 00:22:47,128
Kangwon province would
still have 242 unsaved souls.

450
00:22:52,108 --> 00:22:54,574
Well, now you're
sending out mixed signals.

451
00:22:54,608 --> 00:22:56,300
Then let me send you
a clear one.

452
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,487
I am not attracted to you. Oh.
Oh, nice. First, you use me,

453
00:23:01,487 --> 00:23:04,075
Then you reject me,
and now you're insulting me?

454
00:23:04,108 --> 00:23:06,508
Maybe you should go now,
mrs. Hodge.

455
00:23:06,541 --> 00:23:08,315
Oh, reverend green,
please don't be upset.

456
00:23:08,315 --> 00:23:12,425
??????????

457
00:23:18,238 --> 00:23:19,144
Shoot!

458
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:21,550
Ellie,
can you help me for a sec?

459
00:23:23,808 --> 00:23:25,674
Sure. What's... oh.

460
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:28,674
I spilled my milk again.

461
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,875
Don't worry.
I'll clean it up.

462
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:35,474
God, i'm so sick
of knocking crap over.

463
00:23:35,508 --> 00:23:38,675
I don't know how gaby puts up
with me. She's a saint.

464
00:23:39,407 --> 00:23:41,075
Yeah, well...

465
00:23:42,508 --> 00:23:44,307
"Well," what?

466
00:23:51,641 --> 00:23:53,274
Hey, sweetie.

467
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:54,574
Hey, whore!

468
00:23:54,608 --> 00:23:57,208
Excuse me?

469
00:23:57,242 --> 00:24:00,142
I know all about your affair
with the handyman.

470
00:24:00,175 --> 00:24:01,775
Ellie told me everything.

471
00:24:01,808 --> 00:24:04,775
That little snitch.

472
00:24:04,808 --> 00:24:07,608
I can't believe
she did that!

473
00:24:07,641 --> 00:24:10,008
Well,
thanks for letting me know.

474
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:15,407
Uh, hello?

475
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:17,908
Are we even gonna talk
about this?

476
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:19,440
Yeah, the second
that bitch gets home,

477
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,988
I'm gonna let her have it.

478
00:24:20,988 --> 00:24:22,675
Boy, you trust someone,
and they just betray you.

479
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:28,541
It sucks, you know? Yeah, i know!
Gaby, you cheated and you got caught.

480
00:24:28,574 --> 00:24:29,941
Now will you please
hand me a plate

481
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:33,474
So i can smash it against the wall?
Oh, you moron! There was no affair!

482
00:24:33,508 --> 00:24:36,341
That was the cop. Ellie caught
us putting the bug in her room.

483
00:24:36,374 --> 00:24:38,808
That was just an excuse
we used as a cover.

484
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:40,875
And you expect me
to believethat?

485
00:24:40,908 --> 00:24:44,503
I got news for you, carlos.
You're blind.

486
00:24:44,503 --> 00:24:45,363
You don't have
a choice anymore.

487
00:24:45,363 --> 00:24:47,242
You have to believe
what i tell you.

488
00:24:47,274 --> 00:24:49,128
Just like when i hand you
the deodorant,

489
00:24:49,128 --> 00:24:51,190
You have to believe
it's not oven cleaner.

490
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,737
I know it's not fair. I know
it gives me absolute power,

491
00:24:53,737 --> 00:24:56,675
But tough. You're screwed.
Deal with it!

492
00:24:58,313 --> 00:24:58,999
Are we good?

493
00:25:01,242 --> 00:25:03,008
Okay.

494
00:25:03,041 --> 00:25:05,741
Thank you. Now please,
i just lost a friend.

495
00:25:05,775 --> 00:25:08,108
Stop being so insensitive.

496
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:17,174
Pastor joe.

497
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:19,488
I noticed that there
are no programs. Oh, yes.

498
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:22,113
Reverend green decided to change
today's scripture reading.

499
00:25:22,113 --> 00:25:25,050
It's going to be
colossians 3:5.

500
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:29,363
Oh, he wants to talk
about sexual promiscuity?

501
00:25:29,363 --> 00:25:30,675
Well,
it was a last minute thing.

502
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:32,143
He came in this morning
muttering about

503
00:25:32,143 --> 00:25:34,722
Some "redheaded harlot"
in our midst

504
00:25:34,722 --> 00:25:36,269
Who needs to be unmasked.

505
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:39,378
I don't know. I was just so
relieved he was off the koreans,

506
00:25:39,379 --> 00:25:42,603
I didn't ask questions.
Excuse me a minute.

507
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,488
Oh. Hello.

508
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:57,644
Sorry.
I know this is a bad time.

509
00:25:57,644 --> 00:25:59,577
Aren't you
bree hodge's ex-Husband?

510
00:25:59,644 --> 00:26:01,487
No, i'm her current husband,

511
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:04,999
And i need to speak to you
about today's sermon.

512
00:26:06,222 --> 00:26:08,582
They're a little late
getting started.

513
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:10,862
I know, and reverend green

514
00:26:10,862 --> 00:26:14,175
Is usually such a stickler
for punctuality.

515
00:26:14,695 --> 00:26:16,800
Well,
i don't mean to be rude,

516
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,262
But i don't think my sermon
is any of your business.

517
00:26:20,295 --> 00:26:22,228
Let me put it this way.

518
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,332
If you say anything
about bree,

519
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:27,295
You and i are
gonna have a problem.

520
00:26:27,328 --> 00:26:29,629
Well,
i'm sorry you feel that way,

521
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:32,644
But i think
it's my duty as pastor

522
00:26:32,644 --> 00:26:35,695
To warn my flock
when a temptress sits among us.

523
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:38,238
Now if you'll excuse me.

524
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:42,362
What
the hell's the matter with you?

525
00:26:42,362 --> 00:26:44,238
I'm not going
to let you go out there

526
00:26:44,238 --> 00:26:49,629
And trash that good woman's
name. "Good woman"? She led me on.

527
00:26:49,662 --> 00:26:51,695
Who are they talking about?

528
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:54,061
She's a flame-Haired jezebel!

529
00:26:54,095 --> 00:26:58,162
You're insane! She is
the most moral person i know!

530
00:26:58,195 --> 00:27:01,050
I have no idea. Now if you'll please excuse
me. Would a moral person lead a man on

531
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:03,737
And then humiliate him? I
don't care what she did to you.

532
00:27:03,737 --> 00:27:06,441
I am not going
to let you publicly declare

533
00:27:06,441 --> 00:27:10,095
That bree hodge is a slut!
Oh, dear lord.

534
00:27:18,061 --> 00:27:19,295
Then again,

535
00:27:19,328 --> 00:27:22,862
I suppose i could
preach about tolerance today.

536
00:27:24,262 --> 00:27:26,729
Orson.

537
00:27:26,762 --> 00:27:28,729
Orson.

538
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:32,262
Hello, maynard.

539
00:27:32,295 --> 00:27:35,228
I love you, maynard.

540
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:38,800
My sweet little... may may.

541
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,796
Mamie.

542
00:27:40,829 --> 00:27:42,928
Nerd.

543
00:27:58,195 --> 00:28:01,961
Hello. I need to change the name
on my baby's birth certificate.

544
00:28:01,995 --> 00:28:04,995
Okay, last name?
Delfino, maynard.

545
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:07,762
Where's the father?
You both need to sign this.

546
00:28:07,796 --> 00:28:10,796
Oh. Working.
Busy, busy, busy.

547
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:13,796
Uh, but he told me to tell you
that he's totally cool with it.

548
00:28:13,829 --> 00:28:16,691
Well,
i'm busy, busy, busy, too.

549
00:28:16,691 --> 00:28:18,675
So when he's available,
you can come on back,

550
00:28:18,675 --> 00:28:20,195
And we'll make the change.

551
00:28:20,228 --> 00:28:21,816
Oh.

552
00:28:23,995 --> 00:28:25,462
Okay.

553
00:28:25,495 --> 00:28:27,597
I'm just gonna level
with you.

554
00:28:27,597 --> 00:28:30,995
My husband picked the name,
and i think it's horrible,

555
00:28:31,028 --> 00:28:33,362
And i know over time,
he's gonna agree.

556
00:28:33,395 --> 00:28:36,113
I don't care.
Rules are rules.

557
00:28:36,113 --> 00:28:37,675
You gotta help me out here.

558
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:39,295
I'm just trying
to protect my child.

559
00:28:39,328 --> 00:28:40,175
I don't want him
to go through life

560
00:28:40,175 --> 00:28:44,129
Saddled with the name "maynard."
I don't see what the big deal is.

561
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:47,095
Well, of course, you don't.
You're vanessa.

562
00:28:47,128 --> 00:28:49,228
You went through life
with a beautiful name.

563
00:28:49,262 --> 00:28:52,228
That's why you have
such a crackerjack personality.

564
00:28:52,262 --> 00:28:54,529
I think we're done here.

565
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:00,394
I have a couple errands to run.
Will you cover for me?

566
00:29:00,394 --> 00:29:02,999
No problem.
Thanks, griselda.

567
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,228
Griselda...

568
00:29:10,262 --> 00:29:13,295
That must have been a tough name
to take out on the playground.

569
00:29:13,328 --> 00:29:15,262
Yeah.

570
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,128
Actually, it was.

571
00:29:18,928 --> 00:29:20,644
We should talk.

572
00:29:25,529 --> 00:29:28,612
Hi. I'm, uh, here
to check on orson hodge.

573
00:29:28,612 --> 00:29:30,721
An ambulance brought him in
less than an hour ago.

574
00:29:30,721 --> 00:29:31,988
Are you family?

575
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,729
I'm his wife.

576
00:29:34,762 --> 00:29:37,028
Well, he's going to be fine.

577
00:29:37,061 --> 00:29:38,328
There's no concussion,

578
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:41,395
But the doctors do wanna keep
him here for a couple of hours.

579
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:43,961
Should i tell him
that you're here?

580
00:29:51,495 --> 00:29:55,028
No, that's all right.
Let him rest.

581
00:29:58,595 --> 00:30:02,262
But please
take excellent care of him.

582
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:04,128
He's a good man.

583
00:30:08,762 --> 00:30:10,729
Gaby, can i talk to you?

584
00:30:11,863 --> 00:30:13,796
About how you snitched on me
to carlos?

585
00:30:13,829 --> 00:30:16,363
No, thanks.
I'm all caught up on that.

586
00:30:18,263 --> 00:30:21,816
I'm sorry,
but i know from experience

587
00:30:21,816 --> 00:30:23,363
What cheating can do
to people.

588
00:30:24,238 --> 00:30:26,050
Let me guess.
This story ends with you

589
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,196
Throwing your boyfriend's
varsity jacket in the lake?

590
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,096
When i was 13,

591
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:39,050
My dad caught
my mom having an affair,

592
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,662
And he walked out on us.

593
00:30:40,696 --> 00:30:43,130
Oh.

594
00:30:43,163 --> 00:30:46,597
We had nothing, okay?
My mom went crazy,

595
00:30:46,629 --> 00:30:48,796
And i ended up
on the street.

596
00:30:48,829 --> 00:30:50,519
To survive, i...

597
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:53,929
I had to do a bunch of stuff
that i'm not proud of.

598
00:30:53,963 --> 00:30:55,829
Oh, ellie,
i'm so sorry.

599
00:30:59,929 --> 00:31:01,230
I had no idea.

600
00:31:01,263 --> 00:31:04,196
What have we got here?

601
00:31:05,796 --> 00:31:07,175
That's our guy.

602
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:09,829
The point is,

603
00:31:09,863 --> 00:31:13,463
The one bad decision
can mess up a lot of lives,

604
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:17,029
And i just don't want that
to happen to you and carlos

605
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:19,425
'Cause i love you guys.

606
00:31:30,796 --> 00:31:31,963
Yes?

607
00:31:31,996 --> 00:31:33,530
Supplier's coming your way.

608
00:31:33,563 --> 00:31:36,253
We're gonna arrest them both,
so get out of there now.

609
00:31:37,796 --> 00:31:40,629
Okay. Bye.

610
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:44,929
Anyway, i didn't mean
to get into a whole thing.

611
00:31:44,963 --> 00:31:47,330
I just wanted
to say i'm sorry.

612
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,530
The cops are coming. Go.

613
00:31:49,563 --> 00:31:50,629
What?!

614
00:31:51,941 --> 00:31:53,096
Police! Drop the bag!
Drop the bag!

615
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:55,863
Hands behind your head.
It's a sting.

616
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:57,896
Go out the back now.

617
00:32:08,488 --> 00:32:11,379
Adam! Mom said
you were coming tonight.

618
00:32:11,379 --> 00:32:12,910
Oh, i wouldn't miss
it for the world... oh.

619
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,113
So you better be on your "a" game. Okay.

620
00:32:15,113 --> 00:32:16,644
And we're all going out
to dinner afterwards.

621
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:20,425
Adam wants to tell you about your
graduation present. What? What is it?

622
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:23,784
No, no, no. You gotta wait,
but i'll give you a clue.

623
00:32:23,784 --> 00:32:25,999
I hope
your passport's up-To-Date.

624
00:32:31,629 --> 00:32:33,597
Yeah, no.
It's-It's okay, andrew.

625
00:32:33,629 --> 00:32:35,441
You can, uh,
you can just-

626
00:32:35,441 --> 00:32:37,254
You can finish it
in the morning.

627
00:32:37,796 --> 00:32:40,696
Great. See ya. Bye.

628
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:45,096
Need some help with that?

629
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,096
I didn't think
you liked puzzles.

630
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:49,628
Hmm. I can give it a shot.

631
00:32:54,396 --> 00:32:56,800
I need to talk to you...

632
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,050
About lynette.

633
00:32:59,675 --> 00:33:01,996
I'm sorry i had to call
dr. Dolan, daddy,

634
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:03,696
But she scares me.

635
00:33:03,729 --> 00:33:05,130
Yeah.

636
00:33:05,163 --> 00:33:06,929
You said that before,

637
00:33:06,963 --> 00:33:08,191
But here's the thing.

638
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:09,800
They're gonna
let lynette go soon,

639
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,530
And when they do,
you guys aren't

640
00:33:12,563 --> 00:33:14,941
Gonna be able to live
in the same house anymore.

641
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:17,363
You-You know that, right?

642
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:20,963
So where is she gonna live?

643
00:33:20,996 --> 00:33:23,597
Like, in a hotel
or something?

644
00:33:25,196 --> 00:33:26,896
She lives here, kayla,

645
00:33:28,191 --> 00:33:29,796
With me and the boys
and penny.

646
00:33:29,829 --> 00:33:31,130
This is her home.

647
00:33:31,925 --> 00:33:32,300
But-

648
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,029
But don't worry. We're gonna
find you a nice place to live.

649
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,330
Daddy,
i don't wanna go anywhere.

650
00:33:38,363 --> 00:33:40,175
I wanna stay here with you.

651
00:33:40,175 --> 00:33:44,831
I don't have a choice, kayla.
I need to keep you safe.

652
00:33:45,378 --> 00:33:46,999
But i made it all up.

653
00:33:49,196 --> 00:33:51,363
I lied about everything.

654
00:33:52,996 --> 00:33:54,929
I burned myself.

655
00:33:56,363 --> 00:33:58,063
And why would you do that,
kayla?

656
00:33:58,096 --> 00:33:59,696
I hate her.

657
00:33:59,729 --> 00:34:02,829
And it's so much better
when it's just us.

658
00:34:09,296 --> 00:34:12,378
I see. And you'll explain
all this to the police

659
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:14,487
And dr. Dolan
and everybody, right?

660
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:18,463
Yes, i promise.
And then i can stay, right?

661
00:34:20,762 --> 00:34:22,729
No, sweetie. No.

662
00:34:22,762 --> 00:34:25,563
What you did was horrible,

663
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,796
And i can't trust you
anymore.

664
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,230
Then i'm gonna keep lying
to everybody.

665
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:33,196
You don't want that,
do you?

666
00:34:39,363 --> 00:34:42,296
Did you get all that,
dr. Dolan?

667
00:35:02,113 --> 00:35:03,762
I'm gonna go stretch my legs
and check my service real quick.

668
00:35:03,796 --> 00:35:05,988
Okay, but intermission's
only ten minutes.

669
00:35:05,988 --> 00:35:07,113
Yeah.

670
00:35:17,396 --> 00:35:20,762
Excuse me.
Could you give me a hand?

671
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:23,796
What's up? Nail in my
tire. I gotta change it now

672
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:26,363
'Cause????????????

673
00:35:26,396 --> 00:35:28,425
I'm-I'm catching a red-Eye.
Yeah, sure. I can help.

674
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:30,378
Oh, thanks.
I'm right over here.

675
00:35:31,662 --> 00:35:33,896
Wow,
this thing's really flat.

676
00:35:33,929 --> 00:35:36,230
Usually with a nail,
you get a slow leak.

677
00:35:36,263 --> 00:35:38,487
Yeah. I'm lucky
i even made it here.

678
00:35:38,487 --> 00:35:39,941
Well, i got this.

679
00:35:39,941 --> 00:35:41,254
You grab the spare.

680
00:35:43,659 --> 00:35:45,230
My daughter's the one
that plays the cello.

681
00:35:45,263 --> 00:35:47,296
Which one is your daughter?

682
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:49,829
That's the other thing
i need your help with.

683
00:36:09,862 --> 00:36:10,504
Oh, honey,

684
00:36:10,504 --> 00:36:12,999
Can you get all my toiletries
out of the bathroom?

685
00:36:18,454 --> 00:36:19,800
What are those?

686
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,828
Well, it's cute, aren't they?
It's a hospital tradition.

687
00:36:24,661 --> 00:36:26,300
Get them out of here now.

688
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:28,738
Why?
Because my husband

689
00:36:28,738 --> 00:36:30,816
Is terrified of balloons.

690
00:36:31,956 --> 00:36:34,062
He was once molested
by a clown.

691
00:36:34,095 --> 00:36:36,928
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, i got it.

692
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,113
What's going on?

693
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:45,928
I'm sorry, sir.
We didn't know about the clown.

694
00:36:47,941 --> 00:36:51,828
Why does that say "conner"?
Is that what it said?

695
00:36:51,862 --> 00:36:53,941
We had "maynard" ones
printed up,

696
00:36:53,941 --> 00:36:54,925
But mrs. Delfino...
shh!

697
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:57,675
Went to the records office...

698
00:36:58,496 --> 00:37:02,596
Susan... what's going on?

699
00:37:02,628 --> 00:37:04,028
Well...

700
00:37:04,062 --> 00:37:06,441
I hate the name "maynard."

701
00:37:06,441 --> 00:37:09,175
Really? I like it-
Get out.

702
00:37:12,641 --> 00:37:14,706
I'm sorry. I...

703
00:37:15,362 --> 00:37:19,429
I just want our kid
to have a great name.

704
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,613
I don't think "maynard"
is great.

705
00:37:28,172 --> 00:37:30,237
You wanna know what is great?

706
00:37:32,816 --> 00:37:34,753
My grandfather...

707
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:38,329
Started the first integrated
elementary school in tennessee.

708
00:37:38,362 --> 00:37:40,613
And you know
what else is great?

709
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:42,613
When my dad went to prison,

710
00:37:42,613 --> 00:37:45,237
The state wanted
to put me in the system.

711
00:37:46,095 --> 00:37:48,028
My grandfather
wouldn't let 'em.

712
00:37:48,062 --> 00:37:49,175
He took in my mom and me

713
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:52,095
And sacrificed everything

714
00:37:52,129 --> 00:37:54,362
Just to make sure
we had a great life.

715
00:37:56,162 --> 00:37:58,229
Wow.

716
00:37:58,262 --> 00:38:00,329
I didn't know about that.

717
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:04,462
Susan, i don't want to
just give our son a name.

718
00:38:04,496 --> 00:38:09,503
I want to give him
someone to live up to.

719
00:38:19,362 --> 00:38:21,529
Maynard.

720
00:38:22,656 --> 00:38:24,496
Let's hope he's worthy.

721
00:38:25,488 --> 00:38:29,596
Well, that part's up to us.

722
00:38:34,095 --> 00:38:36,895
Well,
that's all of her things.

723
00:38:36,928 --> 00:38:40,175
Well, we should probably
get going, hmm?

724
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:43,237
We found a hotel with a pool
for tonight.

725
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,159
Maybe you and grandpa
can go swimming.

726
00:38:52,429 --> 00:38:54,999
Sheila, can i talk to her
for a sec?

727
00:38:57,329 --> 00:39:00,895
Honey,
i know this is hard on you.

728
00:39:00,928 --> 00:39:02,878
But i'm gonna come visit you
at grandpa and grandma's

729
00:39:02,878 --> 00:39:03,816
All the time.

730
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,925
So it's not like
it's good-Bye forever.

731
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,080
Kayla...

732
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:20,120
I'm sorry how everything turned out.

733
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,000
No,you're not.

734
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,340
Okay,then.

735
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,130
I love you,baby.

736
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:38,340
Have a safe trip.

737
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,570
Daddy! I'm sorry!

738
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:01,090
Daddy,i'm sorry! Please!

739
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:04,110
Daddy! Please!

740
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,950
What's in a name?

741
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,730
Do the labels we attach to people

742
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,160
Tell us everything we need to know?

743
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:31,720
If we say she's just a child,

744
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,960
Does this mean she's truly innocent?

745
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:43,150
Does calling her a drug dealer prove she's purely evil?

746
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,170
Will a man known as "preacher"

747
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:52,600
Always practice what he preaches?

748
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,060
Can a man branded a villain

749
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:00,700
Possess the qualities of a hero?

750
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:03,430
The truth is,

751
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:07,790
A name can never really tell you who someone is...

752
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,850
Who are you?

753
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:23,530
Any more than it can tell you what they're capable of.

754
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,620
I'm wayne davis...

755
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,590
And we're about to have some fun.

756
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,700
The next morning

757
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,670
It had been 14 years

758
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:47,040
Since katherine mayfair had been in a police station,

759
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,420
But she remembered the conversation

760
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,090
Like it was yesterday.

761
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,380
Would you like some water,honey?

762
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,050
Thanks.

763
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,050
So... i take it

764
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,940
This isn't the first time your husband's hit you?

765
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,460
He keeps promising to stop, but it just gets worse.

766
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:09,340
And i'm afraid he's gonna do something to my daughter.

767
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:12,390
Please, you have to help me.

768
00:42:12,550 --> 00:42:14,330
Have you reported him before?

769
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,460
Once,but when i called,

770
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:18,390
They said they couldn't find the paperwork.

771
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,490
Oh.

772
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:25,030
Your husband's wayne davis, one of our patrolmen.

773
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:29,790
Want some advice?

774
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,920
Wayne's got a lot of friends around here.

775
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:35,930
Of course you can press charges,but...

776
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:36,890
I can't guarantee

777
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,240
That one of his friends won't lose the paperwork again.

778
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,800
Then what should i do?

779
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:45,620
Get as much money as you can lay your hands on,

780
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,600
Grab your daughter...

781
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:50,040
And run.

782
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,460
And so she did...

783
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,380
To a place she thought would be safe.

784
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:05,630
Mrs. Mayfair?

785
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,100
I'm detective romslo. Can i help you?

786
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:12,870
Why exactly would you think that dr. Mayfair was kidnapped?

787
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,350
No one in the school parking lot

788
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:17,260
Heard or saw anything suspicious.

789
00:43:17,420 --> 00:43:21,430
That's because the man responsible for this-My ex-

790
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:24,190
Knows a little something about how to commit a crime.

791
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:25,990
He's a cop.

792
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,810
What's his name?

793
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:30,370
Wayne davis.

794
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:34,570
What?

795
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,980
Well,it's just,uh...

796
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,810
I know wayne. We've hung out together.

797
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,930
He's a hell of a golfer.

798
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:47,540
Well,believe me when i tell you he wasn't a hell of a husband.

799
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:48,750
Is that what this is about?

800
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:52,170
Some payback for an ancient domestic dispute?

801
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,680
Please. You have to do something.

802
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:00,030
Because once wayne is done with adam,

803
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,340
He's going to come after me.

804
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:05,860
And this time, he's gonna kill me. I know it.

805
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:09,140
I'll look into it.

806
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,950
If you would just,uh, fill out this paperwork...

807
00:44:14,410 --> 00:44:19,610
In that moment,katherine knew exactly what she had to do...

808
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,230
Again.

809
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:24,060
Mom,stop. You're not making any sense. There's no time.

810
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,450
Wayne is coming. He took adam. We're next.

811
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,300
But why? Why would he do that? And if we're in so much danger,

812
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,470
Then why aren't we calling the police? The police will not help. Dylan,please!

813
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:36,460
Go pack your things. We need to be gone before he gets here. Stop!

814
00:44:36,610 --> 00:44:41,180
I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what's going on.

815
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:44,690
Why do i have to be afraid of my father?

816
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:45,870
Katherine mayfair

817
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:50,200
Had been running from the truth for a long time...

818
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,500
Okay.

819
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:54,560
I'll tell you.

820
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,490
No!

821
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:59,640
Dylan. Dylan,i'm sorry. I had no choice! No!

822
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,010
Dylan!

823
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:06,540
And it had finally caught up with her.

824
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,480
There's a ritual my friends have observed for years.

825
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,980
Once a week,they meet to play a game of cards

826
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,300
And talk about their lives.

827
00:45:18,470 --> 00:45:21,200
There's always laughter and wine...

828
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,500
And talk about the neighbors.

829
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:25,070
No way,bree. I don't want katherine in our games.

830
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:27,710
She bums me out. Oh,i'm with gaby. I mean,you know me.

831
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:31,420
I always like to give people the benefit of the doubt... no,you don't.

832
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:33,100
No,i don't, but let's say i did.

833
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,630
Katherine has this aloof quality.

834
00:45:34,790 --> 00:45:37,790
It's like she's always trying to keep us at arm's length. Well,i have to agree.

835
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,700
She's changed. She's not that fun anymore. Ladies,i don't know what you're talking about.

836
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:45,780
Katherine has all sorts of wonderful qualities. Name one,and keep in mind

837
00:45:45,950 --> 00:45:48,130
That "aloof" and "unfun" have already been taken.

838
00:45:48,290 --> 00:45:50,550
Well,i admit she plays her cards close to the vest,

839
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,900
But some of you could benefit from that kind of quiet dignity,

840
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,080
Miss i-Chew-Gum- Like-A-1930s-Gun-Moll.

841
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,750
Bree,you can talk katherine up all you want,

842
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,290
But she is just never gonna be one of us.

843
00:46:02,710 --> 00:46:05,090
Anybody home?

844
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:07,540
Oh.

845
00:46:07,720 --> 00:46:11,600
Hi! We were just talking about you. Random chitchat,nothing specific.

846
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,380
That's nice. Could i talk to you for a minute?

847
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,620
Hey. What's going on? Okay,i know it's last minute,

848
00:46:17,770 --> 00:46:19,080
But i have to leave town, so i'm not gonna be able

849
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:23,300
To help you cater the commitment ceremony. It's tomorrow!

850
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:25,110
A hundred gay men are descending on this street,

851
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,570
And they're expecting a fabulous party. I feel awful,

852
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:31,540
But i wouldn't bail on you if it weren't important.

853
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,000
Okay. Well,what's going on?

854
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:36,250
I can't tell you. Again,i'm so sorry.

855
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:38,310
Good luck.

856
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:48,280
All right,you can all wipe those smug looks off your faces,

857
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:52,410
Because every one of you has just become my employee.

858
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,930
Hey,got any plans tomorrow at 5:00 a.M.? 'Cause now you do.

859
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:02,040
Bree needs about two truckloads of flowers picked up from...

860
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:03,540
What?

861
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,820
Guess who got off the wait-List at princeton!

862
00:47:05,980 --> 00:47:08,300
Oh,my god. Oh,my god!

863
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:11,370
I'm so proud of you!

864
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,590
Okay,i am going to need a bumper sticker right away

865
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:18,100
So i can start annoying all the other parents! Sure. I'll snag you one when i get there on tuesday.

866
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:22,360
Tuesday? What are you talking about? Okay,you know that professor who read my senior thesis?

867
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,330
Well,he was so impressed

868
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,490
That he asked me to come out and do a summer internship.

869
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:26,540
I'm leaving next week.

870
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,550
Next week? W- Well,that is a big...

871
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:32,130
No.

872
00:47:32,270 --> 00:47:34,400
No? Mom,i have to. It's a huge honor.

873
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:36,490
Yes... t

874
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,440
And you have been chosen.

875
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,110
So congratulations,

876
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:41,710
And you're staying home.

877
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,430
Oh,you're not letting her go?

878
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:45,360
But it's a huge honor.

879
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:48,610
Yes,we've established that. It's huge. It's an honor.

880
00:47:48,770 --> 00:47:50,290
We get it.

881
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,070
Give me one good reason why i can't go.

882
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:55,410
Well,the first thing off the top of my head...

883
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:56,660
Uh...

884
00:47:57,810 --> 00:48:00,120
We can't afford it.

885
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,320
Susan,can i talk to you for a sec?

886
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,750
You know, i just inherited 5 grand

887
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:07,720
From grandpa maynard,

888
00:48:07,890 --> 00:48:12,250
And i... i'd really like to help julie do this.

889
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,610
Mike,that is so sweet.

890
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,640
Mike makes another good point.

891
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,030
Who is this professor?

892
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:20,090
I don't know him.

893
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:23,700
I am certainly not going to give my daughter to him for a summer.

894
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,350
I'm sorry,julie. This is not happening.

895
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,420
This totally sucks.

896
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,130
Well,yes, but don't forget-

897
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,080
It is a huge honor.

898
00:48:39,010 --> 00:48:39,940
Hey.

899
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:44,100
You know what we haven't done in a really long time?

900
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:47,150
Made 250 mini pizzas in one afternoon.

901
00:48:47,290 --> 00:48:49,210
What are you talking about?

902
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:52,050
Bree's in a horrible jam, and i told her we'd help cater

903
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,850
The commitment ceremony tomorrow.

904
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:56,860
I can't. I'm busy,remember? I'm taking this stuff to kayla,

905
00:48:57,010 --> 00:49:00,110
My daughter who lives four and a half hours away now.

906
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,290
Okay,so at the risk

907
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:04,890
Of cracking these eggshells i've been walking on all week,

908
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,500
Any idea when you're gonna stop being so angry?

909
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,140
I'm not angry at you.

910
00:49:10,290 --> 00:49:12,430
'Cause you know we didn't have a choice,tom.

911
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,960
We had to get her out of the house.

912
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:15,730
I know. I am angry at the situation.

913
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,930
Can you please just let me be angry?

914
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:21,440
Fine. You can be as angry and sulky and pissy as you want,

915
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,950
Just so long as you're here tomorrow,

916
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:27,420
Helping me crank out 250 mini pizzas.

917
00:49:27,850 --> 00:49:28,900
You know,i've been told

918
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:30,920
That some wives ask their husbands for favors

919
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:33,910
And actually say,"please."

920
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:35,360
Oh,tom.

921
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:38,920
Don't you know an urban myth when you hear one?

922
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:44,590
Okay,so here's the deal.

923
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:46,350
Bree needs all of these wedding favors

924
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,070
Wrapped by tomorrow, and she's really counting on me,

925
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:52,140
So... i'm gonna need you to hurry.

926
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:55,120
I just got off the phone with the credit card company.

927
00:49:55,290 --> 00:49:57,740
Do you have something that you wanna tell me?

928
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:02,130
Mm... well,it would be easier if i knew what you knew. Damn it,gaby,enough shopping!

929
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:04,340
You've maxed out every credit card we own.

930
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:05,560
I mean, we are so broke right now,

931
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:09,460
It's gonna be a miracle if we don't end up on the street. Okay,when you yell at me,i get upset.

932
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:11,750
And you know what i do when i get upset? I shop.

933
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,970
So if we do end up homeless, guess whose fault it'll be.

934
00:50:15,130 --> 00:50:21,750
Whatever. I'm gonna go read porn... in braille.

935
00:50:27,570 --> 00:50:30,080
Hello? Gaby,it's ellie.

936
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,420
Ellie,you can't call me! The cops are all over my ass

937
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:35,010
Because they think i helped you escape.

938
00:50:35,170 --> 00:50:36,570
I'm sorry. I just need one more favor,

939
00:50:36,730 --> 00:50:40,790
And then i'll never bother you again. Oh! Ellie,i don't know. What is it?

940
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:42,880
I left my teddy bear in the coat closet.

941
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:47,260
I need you to bring it to me. Teddy bear? What is that,code for "a pound of blow"?

942
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:50,060
No,it's an actual teddy bear.

943
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,830
My dad gave it to me when i was 5,

944
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,920
And it's the only thing i have left to remember him by.

945
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,340
Crap.

946
00:50:57,550 --> 00:50:59,800
Ya had to play the daddy card.

947
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:11,920
Hmm.

948
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:24,640
??? Y, we'll open up the buffet...

949
00:51:24,810 --> 00:51:27,080
Mm-Hmm. Uh,chicken marsala, and pasta for the vegetarians.

950
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:30,150
And dancing,roll out the cake, you leave for your honeymoon,

951
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:32,630
And i will collapse in a tasteful heap.

952
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:34,990
Hold it. You didn't say anything about the ice sculpture.

953
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:39,820
Oh! Yes,i'm sorry. One cherub delivered at 1:30. Cherub? No,i specifically

954
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:42,660
Told katherine we were gonna go with the enchanted castle.

955
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,330
And i told her we'd go with the cherub

956
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,760
Because we are not 8- Year-Old girls. Bob,all my life

957
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,620
I have dreamt of having a wedding reception

958
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:51,780
In which i would serve drinks from a vodka moat

959
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:54,550
Surrounding an enchanted castle rendered in ice,

960
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:57,410
And i don't think that's too much to ask. Remember when you asked me

961
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:59,390
To tell you when you start acting like faye dunaway

962
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,140
From the boardroom scene in "mommie dearest"?

963
00:52:03,310 --> 00:52:06,260
Uh,why don't i let you two work this out?

964
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:10,130
Fine,we'll go with the stupid baby angel.

965
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:14,020
I need some coffee.

966
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,620
Why are you here? And don't say for the pizza,

967
00:52:16,790 --> 00:52:18,470
Because i know you're lactose-Intolerant.

968
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:20,450
I heard katherine left you in the lurch.

969
00:52:20,610 --> 00:52:24,150
I'm here to offer my assistance. Oh,i get it. So i'm desperate and vulnerable,

970
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,890
And you're gonna swoop in and save the day.

971
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:29,390
Well,thank you very much. I'm fine. Darling, don't be stubborn. You're gonna need place cards,

972
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,400
And you know i have excellent penmanship. Don't you dare

973
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,170
Throw your calligraphy skills in my face when you know

974
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:38,820
I'm at a low point. Now go! And stop following me.

975
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:44,990
You're doomed.

976
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:46,660
Excuse me?

977
00:52:46,830 --> 00:52:49,300
The way you just caved on that sculpture thing?

978
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,960
You're setting the tone for your entire marriage. I am?

979
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,810
Yeah. You gotta dig in your heels.

980
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:57,000
Otherwise,you're gonna be pushed around for the next...

981
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,680
Let's see. How long have i been married?

982
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:02,630
Ten and a half years.

983
00:53:06,070 --> 00:53:07,740
I want my castle.

984
00:53:07,910 --> 00:53:09,960
Lee... it is the only thing i've asked for,

985
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:12,900
And damn it, i'm entitled to it.

986
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,170
Fine.

987
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:17,230
Oh.

988
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:20,200
Thank you.

989
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:25,230
All right,so i will call the ice sculptor

990
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:29,290
And see if we can - Forget it. We're sticking with the cherub.

991
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:30,530
And later, when he bitches about it,

992
00:53:30,690 --> 00:53:32,990
I'll just buy him some jewelry.

993
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:35,870
You sure you haven't been married before?

994
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:36,940
Hey,gaby?

995
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:39,040
Over here,carlos.

996
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,660
You know,i got a theory

997
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:43,390
As to why all this bad stuff has happened to us-

998
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,520
My blindness and losing all our money...

999
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,940
It's karma. You know, we've been selfish and greedy,

1000
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,810
And the universe is telling us to start being better people.

1001
00:53:53,050 --> 00:53:57,230
I just found $118,000 in ellie's teddy bear.

1002
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,200
Hey,universe?

1003
00:53:59,370 --> 00:54:00,880
Bite me!

1004
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:01,620
Hello?

1005
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,160
Hey,wayne? It's pete romslo.

1006
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:06,620
Pete! How's tricks?

1007
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:07,760
Listen,uh, i'm just calling

1008
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:08,640
To give you a heads-Up.

1009
00:54:08,790 --> 00:54:13,040
Um,i finally met your ex. She came in to file a report.

1010
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:15,570
Apparently, you,uh,kidnapped her husband.

1011
00:54:15,750 --> 00:54:18,270
No kidding? Am i asking for ransom?

1012
00:54:18,650 --> 00:54:20,310
Well,you always said she was crazy.

1013
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,120
Now i feel your pain.

1014
00:54:22,290 --> 00:54:26,880
Anyway,i-I just thought you should know,huh? Take care. Thanks.

1015
00:54:31,090 --> 00:54:33,530
Okay,enough kiddin' around.

1016
00:54:33,790 --> 00:54:36,380
Tell me where my daughter is.

1017
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:42,040
Oh,for-

1018
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:45,940
Did you die on me?

1019
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:52,560
Damn it!

1020
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,720
Okay,so you have another one of those in the truck?

1021
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,290
Thank you. I'll be back in ten minutes!

1022
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:15,970
We need more settings on five,please. Lynette, i wish i had time to be more tactful,but i don't.

1023
00:55:16,140 --> 00:55:18,880
Your swan is pathetic,and i'm firing you from napkin duty.

1024
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,940
No,no,give me another chance. I will get it.

1025
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:22,980
Yes?

1026
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:25,550
Oh,there you are! Where is my ice sculpture?

1027
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:29,560
No! No,6:00 is too late. I need it now.

1028
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:33,020
Oh,forget it. I'll pick it up myself.

1029
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,700
Why don't you fill water glasses?

1030
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:38,690
That's an important job,too.

1031
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,890
Andrew... look,i'm on my way back,

1032
00:55:46,050 --> 00:55:47,900
But it's imperative that you...

1033
00:55:48,350 --> 00:55:49,750
Andrew?

1034
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,800
Oh,dear god.

1035
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,780
Oh,no. Don't die on me now!

1036
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,450
Aah!

1037
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:01,260
Oh,dear god.

1038
00:56:34,450 --> 00:56:36,440
Aah! Help me!

1039
00:56:36,600 --> 00:56:38,910
Help!

1040
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:44,570
I'm just saying we should pay off all of our bills

1041
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:48,140
And put the rest in savings. Savings? Nobody does that anymore.

1042
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,170
Well,i mean,you never know. We might have kids.

1043
00:56:50,330 --> 00:56:52,500
Oh,carlos, we're never gonna have kids.

1044
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:56,710
Shoes are my kids. Let me be the mother i was meant to be.

1045
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,500
Hello?

1046
00:57:00,020 --> 00:57:01,780
Where's my bear?

1047
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,320
Oh. Right. The bear.

1048
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:10,450
Well... i looked all over and just couldn't find it.

1049
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:14,140
I guess the cops took it. I'm really sorry,ellie.

1050
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:15,580
I know it was a gift from your dad.

1051
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:17,720
It just breaks my heart.

1052
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:21,500
You found the money,didn't you? Money? What money?

1053
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:23,740
You're lying. I can hear it in your voice.

1054
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,020
What's wrong with my voice?

1055
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:29,460
Okay,listen,bitch. You do not wanna screw with me.

1056
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:33,150
How about we split it 50-50?

1057
00:57:33,970 --> 00:57:35,260
I'm coming to get my money,

1058
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:39,620
And if one dime is missing, i will throw acid in your face.

1059
00:57:43,890 --> 00:57:46,840
Okay,we really need to get caller i.D.

1060
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,050
Ugh.

1061
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:09,550
What more can you do to me?

1062
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,460
Need a lift?

1063
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:23,150
Hey.

1064
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:26,300
Hi. Is,uh,dylan here by any chance?

1065
00:58:26,470 --> 00:58:28,240
Uh,um,no, i- I haven't seen her.

1066
00:58:28,410 --> 00:58:29,370
Okay. Thanks.

1067
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,670
Hey,katherine, are you all right?

1068
00:58:32,050 --> 00:58:34,260
Uh... dylan and i,we...

1069
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,060
Had a big fight.

1070
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:37,890
Well, i'm sure she's just upset,

1071
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:40,800
And she'll come home after she cools off.

1072
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:42,730
Not this time.

1073
00:58:42,940 --> 00:58:44,870
I lied to her.

1074
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:50,040
Well... we all lie to our kids sometimes,right?

1075
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,010
I've been doing it her whole life-

1076
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:53,440
One lie on top of another-

1077
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,290
And the thing... i learned too late

1078
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:59,660
Is that eventually they all come crashing down on you.

1079
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,570
Anyway, if you see her,let me know?

1080
00:59:02,730 --> 00:59:04,500
Thanks.

1081
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:13,470
What's your hurry,kathy?

1082
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:31,370
Aah! Aah!

1083
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:33,690
Aah.

1084
00:59:35,090 --> 00:59:37,050
What happened to my daughter?

1085
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:39,920
I'm not telling you anything,

1086
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:42,240
So you might as well kill me.

1087
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:44,380
I don't care.

1088
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,700
I believe you.

1089
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:48,690
I do.

1090
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:51,370
But what about dylan?

1091
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:56,890
Or should i say,that girl that lives here with you?

1092
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,520
I bet you'd care if i killed her.

1093
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,130
Uh...

1094
01:00:06,310 --> 01:00:08,380
There are no wings.

1095
01:00:08,550 --> 01:00:10,730
Yes,and the "venus de milo" is missing two arms.

1096
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,330
What's your point?

1097
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,290
It's... stunning.

1098
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:28,120
Well,i suppose i should say thank you.

1099
01:00:28,280 --> 01:00:32,120
Oh,it's no big deal. You're just lucky i was there.

1100
01:00:32,520 --> 01:00:36,060
Was i lucky, or were you following me?

1101
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,840
I thought you might need my help.

1102
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:44,090
And you were right. I did.

1103
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,150
You just think i'm being stubborn,don't you?

1104
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,910
Making you jump through hoops

1105
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:50,950
When it's so clear we belong together.

1106
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:52,890
I don't think anything, bree.

1107
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:54,480
I'm just trying to be there for you

1108
01:00:54,650 --> 01:00:58,330
And hoping eventually you'll forgive me.

1109
01:00:58,580 --> 01:00:59,550
But that's just it,orson.

1110
01:00:59,730 --> 01:01:00,400
If i forgive you,

1111
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,020
Then i'm forgiving what you did to mike.

1112
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:07,130
I can't do that. And- And you wouldn't want me to.

1113
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,650
I mean, be honest with yourself.

1114
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:10,430
If i took you back now,

1115
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,980
I wouldn't be the woman you love.

1116
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:15,480
Then what can i do?

1117
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:17,310
I've already told you.

1118
01:01:17,470 --> 01:01:20,410
Turn yourself in to the police and let justice run its course.

1119
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:22,430
I can't do that,bree.

1120
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,340
I want to,

1121
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:29,550
For you, more than anything.

1122
01:01:30,050 --> 01:01:32,660
But i don't think i could survive it.

1123
01:01:33,370 --> 01:01:35,180
Well...

1124
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,470
So here we are.

1125
01:01:47,420 --> 01:01:49,260
What is this? It's your ice sculpture.

1126
01:01:49,420 --> 01:01:50,520
No,it's not.

1127
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,560
I see no turrets. I see no flags.

1128
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:53,840
I see no moat full of vodka.

1129
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:58,420
What i see is a giant,icy slap in the face.

1130
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,010
Bob!

1131
01:02:04,610 --> 01:02:06,500
What's that?

1132
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,390
I want to be able to reach you this summer

1133
01:02:09,570 --> 01:02:12,320
When you're doing that internship.

1134
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:15,580
You changed your mind?

1135
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,110
Here's the thing.

1136
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:19,690
You and i have always had

1137
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:22,370
Kind of an unconventional relationship,

1138
01:02:22,550 --> 01:02:24,230
And the reason that worked

1139
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:27,580
Was because we always tell each other the truth...

1140
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:29,320
Until yesterday.

1141
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:34,650
Julie,i lied about not having enough money to send you.

1142
01:02:34,980 --> 01:02:36,180
Why?

1143
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:40,780
Because i just freaked out about you leaving.

1144
01:02:40,930 --> 01:02:42,660
But you knew i was going away to college.

1145
01:02:42,820 --> 01:02:44,060
Yes,in the fall.

1146
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:48,690
And i needed those extra three months to get ready. I...

1147
01:02:49,810 --> 01:02:53,320
I still have not figured out

1148
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:57,300
How i'm gonna get by without you.

1149
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,570
Mom...

1150
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,600
Seriously...

1151
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,470
I just lean on you in ways you don't even know.

1152
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:09,820
I think you are stronger

1153
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,740
Than you give yourself credit for.

1154
01:03:11,910 --> 01:03:14,810
Well... i spend more time with me than you do,

1155
01:03:14,990 --> 01:03:16,560
And i'm a mess.

1156
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:18,890
Well, you

1157
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:20,120
I had my hands full then.

1158
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:24,250
But you've grown so much these last five years.

1159
01:03:24,410 --> 01:03:26,010
Really?

1160
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:30,000
You are a secure, confident woman now.

1161
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,110
You're ready to spread your wings and fly.

1162
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,880
Frankly, my work here is done.

1163
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:37,660
Thanks.

1164
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:38,500
Now i want you

1165
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,420
To have that phone on you at all times...

1166
01:03:41,800 --> 01:03:45,300
Because i'm still not sure how to work the dishwasher.

1167
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,750
Can you help me?

1168
01:03:52,150 --> 01:03:53,990
For god sake,lee! It's just an ice sculpture!

1169
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:56,770
It is not "just an ice sculpture"!

1170
01:03:56,930 --> 01:03:59,220
It's the sculpture and making me move to the suburbs

1171
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:01,660
And forcing me to be nice to your homophobic boss.

1172
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:02,870
You know what? Tom's right.

1173
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:06,560
If i don't start standing up for myself,i'm doomed.

1174
01:04:07,450 --> 01:04:10,480
I don't believe i used the word "doomed."

1175
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:13,370
You're always overruling me. You treat me like a child.

1176
01:04:13,530 --> 01:04:17,160
Well,i've had it! Ceremony's off,mein fuhrer!

1177
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:20,690
It's a chunk of ice, you drama queen!

1178
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:24,480
Okay... all i said was-

1179
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:27,860
I don't care what you said. We have to fix this!

1180
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:30,510
Or do you want to tell bree that you torpedoed her ceremony?

1181
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:32,690
I did not tell you to put mums in that arrangement!

1182
01:04:32,860 --> 01:04:36,890
And don't point your finger at me or i'll snap it right off. I'll find bob.

1183
01:04:37,060 --> 01:04:38,660
I'll get lee. Yeah.

1184
01:04:40,230 --> 01:04:41,070
You can't make me talk to him.

1185
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:44,480
Yeah,i can. Sit down. Earlier,my husband,

1186
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,770
In an attempt to help you with your relationship,

1187
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,420
Mistakenly gave you some advice,

1188
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,290
Which he would now like to take back. Tom?

1189
01:04:52,630 --> 01:04:54,400
Actually,i stand by everything i said.

1190
01:04:54,570 --> 01:04:56,640
My mistake was in not going far enough. What?

1191
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,310
If you're willing to break up over an ice sculpture,

1192
01:04:59,470 --> 01:05:02,300
You guys should absolutely not get married.

1193
01:05:02,460 --> 01:05:04,010
Where the hell are you going with this?

1194
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:06,480
Because who gets to choose the ice sculpture,

1195
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:07,930
Who should take out the trash,

1196
01:05:08,090 --> 01:05:11,020
Who has to stay home and make the mini pizzas-

1197
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:12,710
That's the little stuff.

1198
01:05:12,870 --> 01:05:16,130
What are you gonna do when the big stuff comes along? Could you give us a second?

1199
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,790
No. What are you gonna do when a tornado hits your house,

1200
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,100
Or you have problems with your kids,

1201
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:24,500
Or one of you gets cancer?

1202
01:05:25,150 --> 01:05:28,410
At some point,the crap is going to hit the fan,

1203
01:05:28,570 --> 01:05:31,530
And that is why now, before you make the commitment,

1204
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:33,100
You have to ask yourself,

1205
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:39,630
Is that person in bed next to you worth the trouble?

1206
01:05:40,850 --> 01:05:44,130
Do you love him... or her so much

1207
01:05:44,310 --> 01:05:48,040
That no disease, no disaster

1208
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:51,710
Could possibly pull you apart?

1209
01:05:55,720 --> 01:05:57,910
Answer him.

1210
01:05:58,400 --> 01:05:59,820
Sure. Of course i do.

1211
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:00,930
Good.

1212
01:06:01,700 --> 01:06:03,290
Good,then...

1213
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:06,880
Get out there and get committed, you crazy kids.

1214
01:06:26,990 --> 01:06:28,150
Oh,my god.

1215
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,640
Are you okay? You need some help?

1216
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,330
Yes.

1217
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,490
Thanks for stopping.

1218
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:41,930
Yes,officer. I see you. Thank you for coming.

1219
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:43,720
Now remember, ellie's dangerous.

1220
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,800
So if she shows up,feel free to use excessive force.

1221
01:06:49,310 --> 01:06:51,940
Carlos, are you almost ready?

1222
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,350
Carlos?

1223
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,800
Did you hear me?

1224
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,970
I'm just getting my jacket.

1225
01:07:11,580 --> 01:07:13,070
Oh,honey,can you carry the house keys?

1226
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:15,250
They don't fit in my purse.

1227
01:07:15,550 --> 01:07:17,720
Ellie's upstairs.

1228
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:20,570
What?! She's in our bedroom. I heard her breathing.

1229
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:23,670
Call the cops. Wait! She's gonna steal our money!

1230
01:07:23,860 --> 01:07:25,540
You can't go up there. It's too dangerous.

1231
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:30,430
Well,not as dangerous as poverty! Gaby.

1232
01:08:01,450 --> 01:08:03,320
Gaby? What's going on?

1233
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:10,920
Aah! Carlos!

1234
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,840
Carlos,don't just stand there! Go get help!

1235
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,730
Help! Police!

1236
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:17,530
That's the closet!

1237
01:08:19,320 --> 01:08:19,990
Ow!

1238
01:08:22,870 --> 01:08:25,100
Police! Police!

1239
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,310
Get in here now!

1240
01:08:49,970 --> 01:08:51,450
Wayne.

1241
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:54,270
I don't think you've thought this through.

1242
01:08:54,440 --> 01:08:55,860
Shut up.

1243
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:58,240
If i tell you what happened,

1244
01:08:58,780 --> 01:09:00,870
If i don't tell you...

1245
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:03,560
You're gonna kill me anyway.

1246
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,090
Who you gonna pin it on?

1247
01:09:10,310 --> 01:09:11,960
We have history.

1248
01:09:12,130 --> 01:09:15,050
Right now i'm just your bitter,crazy ex.

1249
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:18,500
But if i turn up dead, and you have no alibi-

1250
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:21,450
You let me worry about that.

1251
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:32,630
Look,i'm having a little problem right now.

1252
01:09:32,790 --> 01:09:34,840
I just need to hide here for a sec.

1253
01:09:35,120 --> 01:09:38,690
And i don't wanna hurt you, so don't make me.

1254
01:09:39,220 --> 01:09:40,740
All right?

1255
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,260
Good.

1256
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,670
I'm glad we understand each other.

1257
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:58,890
Huh.

1258
01:10:00,070 --> 01:10:02,580
And with your gun,too.

1259
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:05,810
I guess i just found my alibi.

1260
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:13,470
And now we will do the exchanging of the rings...

1261
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:15,030
Snappy ceremony,bree.

1262
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:17,050
You and katherine really did a bang-Up job.

1263
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:18,490
No,i did a bang-Up job.

1264
01:10:18,650 --> 01:10:21,130
Katherine bailed on me and left town last night.

1265
01:10:21,290 --> 01:10:23,380
I think you got hosed. I just saw her an hour ago.

1266
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:26,610
...here at this joyous and festive occasion.

1267
01:10:26,990 --> 01:10:28,820
Please join hands.

1268
01:10:30,670 --> 01:10:32,490
She was on the run, she broke in,

1269
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,130
She stabbed you, you shot her. Case closed.

1270
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:40,050
It's like the alibi fairy left me a present.

1271
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:43,730
But i do wonder...

1272
01:10:44,030 --> 01:10:46,830
What if dylan doesn't come back?

1273
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:50,760
We had a fight.

1274
01:10:52,340 --> 01:10:55,630
She said she hated me, said she was leaving...

1275
01:10:55,900 --> 01:10:57,510
For good.

1276
01:10:57,680 --> 01:10:59,460
Is that the best you can do,kathy?

1277
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:04,210
I know it sounds convenient. But what happens if it's true?

1278
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:07,390
Because you don't have another plan.

1279
01:11:07,560 --> 01:11:12,060
She was the only way you could make me tell you the truth.

1280
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:22,730
Katherine? It's bree. We need to talk now!

1281
01:11:27,880 --> 01:11:29,630
That girl that was living with the solises?

1282
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:33,580
Actually,i thought i saw her heading down that way.

1283
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:35,380
Hope you find her.

1284
01:11:35,810 --> 01:11:36,400
I'd hate to think

1285
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,560
There was some maniac running around our neighborhood.

1286
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:46,270
I'm so sorry about this.

1287
01:11:46,430 --> 01:11:47,880
Shut it!

1288
01:11:48,050 --> 01:11:49,970
So let me catch you up.

1289
01:11:50,130 --> 01:11:52,810
I need to know something that only my ex-Wife can tell me,

1290
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:54,820
But she doesn't want to. She needs a little incentive.

1291
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:59,430
So that's where you come in. Wayne... please don't.

1292
01:11:59,590 --> 01:12:02,410
Yeah? How is it gonna feel knowing...

1293
01:12:02,580 --> 01:12:05,140
That you could've stopped this?

1294
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:12,280
All right!

1295
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,140
I'll tell you.

1296
01:12:24,690 --> 01:12:27,010
After i left you...

1297
01:12:28,070 --> 01:12:30,950
A few months passed,

1298
01:12:31,110 --> 01:12:34,370
And i convinced myself

1299
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:37,410
That you'd forgotten about us.

1300
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,630
But i was wrong.

1301
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:45,580
How was dylan? Did she behave herself?

1302
01:12:45,740 --> 01:12:47,180
She's an angel.

1303
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,240
I... just hope i didn't do something wrong.

1304
01:12:51,410 --> 01:12:54,560
What do you mean? Well,your ex-Husband was here earlier,

1305
01:12:54,730 --> 01:12:56,320
And,of course, i didn't know it was him

1306
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:58,860
Until dylan called him "daddy."

1307
01:12:59,550 --> 01:13:01,430
I- I'm sorry, i should've called you,

1308
01:13:01,590 --> 01:13:03,310
But dylan was just so happy to see him.

1309
01:13:03,470 --> 01:13:05,170
He brought her a bicycle and a doll.

1310
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:08,290
And she won't let that doll out of her sight.

1311
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,810
Katherine,what's going on?

1312
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:14,260
I was going to run again,

1313
01:13:14,410 --> 01:13:16,790
But you didn't give me enough time.

1314
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:19,740
Wayne just drove up.

1315
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:22,220
Should we call the police?

1316
01:13:22,460 --> 01:13:23,710
No.

1317
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:26,510
Let him in.

1318
01:13:29,610 --> 01:13:31,760
I knew it was time to face you

1319
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,430
And let you know you were not welcome in my home,

1320
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,720
And neither were your gifts.

1321
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,990
Do you know how much money i spent looking for you? Well,i'm sure

1322
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:53,810
You still had enough to buy liquor by the caseload.

1323
01:13:53,980 --> 01:13:57,470
Wow! Look who's gotten sassy while she's been away.

1324
01:13:57,630 --> 01:13:59,640
Well,i think i like it. What do you want,wayne?

1325
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:03,460
I want my daughter back. Why? You gotten lazy in your old age?

1326
01:14:03,610 --> 01:14:05,130
You need somebody smaller to pound on?

1327
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:06,830
I never touched a hair on her head!

1328
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:10,130
Yeah,but now she's gotten older and sassier,

1329
01:14:10,290 --> 01:14:13,050
I'm sure you'll find all sorts of reasons to hit her. I don't have to ask,you know.

1330
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:16,330
I could just go up there if i want. She is asleep! Get the hell out!

1331
01:14:16,490 --> 01:14:19,000
I'm her father! I said no!

1332
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,650
Uhh. Aah.

1333
01:14:31,070 --> 01:14:32,040
I'm bleeding.

1334
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:33,830
Profusely.

1335
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,190
You should see a doctor.

1336
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:44,730
I'll be back for my daughter.

1337
01:14:44,900 --> 01:14:46,640
You just understand this-

1338
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,850
There is nothing that i will not do

1339
01:14:49,020 --> 01:14:52,470
To keep you away from her. Nothing.

1340
01:14:58,470 --> 01:14:59,370
Are you all right?

1341
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Oh!

1342
01:14:59,530 --> 01:15:02,850
I heard a crash. Yeah,i-I hit him with the candlestick,

1343
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,100
And... he went down pretty hard.

1344
01:15:05,270 --> 01:15:06,920
Thank god.

1345
01:15:07,100 --> 01:15:09,350
You know,i think now would be a good time to break out

1346
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:12,950
The 10-Year-Old scotch i've been saving.

1347
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,660
I honestly thought it was finally over.

1348
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:22,090
I don't know how i could've been so wrong.

1349
01:15:26,900 --> 01:15:28,770
Katherine!

1350
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:34,240
I came in to give her another blanket.

1351
01:15:34,810 --> 01:15:37,850
Her hand is ice-Cold!

1352
01:15:44,340 --> 01:15:47,380
Aunt lily told me i couldn't go to the police.

1353
01:15:47,530 --> 01:15:48,870
She'd said you'd make it seem

1354
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:52,280
Like i killed dylan to keep you from taking her,

1355
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:55,530
So i let her bury my baby in the woods.

1356
01:15:55,700 --> 01:15:57,550
I knew i'd have to run away again,

1357
01:15:57,720 --> 01:16:00,410
But i also knew you'd never stop looking for me,

1358
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,660
So i came up with a plan.

1359
01:16:03,040 --> 01:16:04,520
I found a girl in a romanian orphanage

1360
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:06,830
Who looked just like dylan.

1361
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,820
The resemblance was uncanny.

1362
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:10,760
Her mother had died in childbirth,

1363
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,470
And her father had been murdered.

1364
01:16:13,630 --> 01:16:15,790
As i looked into those big,blue eyes,

1365
01:16:15,960 --> 01:16:17,690
I knew right then...

1366
01:16:17,850 --> 01:16:21,170
She needed me as much as i needed her.

1367
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:34,220
I've never told that to anyone.

1368
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:35,280
I even lied to adam

1369
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:37,630
And said it was your fault.

1370
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:41,470
And that's how i've spent the last 12 years...

1371
01:16:41,730 --> 01:16:45,350
Just telling one lie after another.

1372
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:50,360
Hold it,hold it. I'm sorry,sir.

1373
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,390
We're having a party. You can't park here.

1374
01:16:53,250 --> 01:16:55,770
So you let her die.

1375
01:16:58,410 --> 01:16:59,220
If you don't mind,

1376
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:02,350
I need you to park around the corner,okay?

1377
01:17:03,130 --> 01:17:05,090
Thank you!

1378
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:16,170
You let my daughter die...

1379
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:18,140
Like a dog.

1380
01:17:18,370 --> 01:17:20,300
It was an accident.

1381
01:17:20,460 --> 01:17:23,360
Then you buried her like one.

1382
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:25,600
Because i had to.

1383
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:27,500
I knew if you found out,y-

1384
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,180
That i would kill you.

1385
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,520
Katherine! Where are you?!

1386
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:45,460
Adam!

1387
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:47,850
Get out! He's got a gun!

1388
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:17,380
You just watch over him for a sec,okay?

1389
01:18:17,550 --> 01:18:18,930
I'm gonna call the cops.

1390
01:18:19,090 --> 01:18:22,060
First we have to do something to stop that bleeding. Okay.

1391
01:18:31,160 --> 01:18:34,160
Go ahead. You call the cops.

1392
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,410
Ask for my buddy romslo...

1393
01:18:38,260 --> 01:18:40,520
Or captain mcmurphy.

1394
01:18:41,520 --> 01:18:43,990
We play softball together.

1395
01:18:44,780 --> 01:18:47,180
Those guys'll take care of me.

1396
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:50,530
And even if i do a little time...

1397
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,330
You know this isn't over.

1398
01:18:54,500 --> 01:18:57,170
I'll get out and i'll find you,

1399
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,540
And i'll make you pay.

1400
01:19:01,010 --> 01:19:03,510
I know you will.

1401
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,410
Oh,my god! Bree,are you all right? What the hell is going on?!

1402
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:35,630
We don't have much time before the police get here.

1403
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:37,840
We need to talk.

1404
01:19:39,980 --> 01:19:41,450
Excuse me.

1405
01:19:41,820 --> 01:19:43,920
Susan! Come here,come here.

1406
01:19:44,070 --> 01:19:46,640
What's going on? Okay,just listen to me.

1407
01:19:51,070 --> 01:19:52,900
Ma'am, you have to talk to us.

1408
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,740
We need to know what happened.

1409
01:19:56,020 --> 01:19:57,450
Ma'am?

1410
01:19:58,730 --> 01:20:01,550
Then he raised the gun and came toward us.

1411
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,330
Thank god katherine grabbed his arm and got the gun away.

1412
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:07,390
That lunatic would've killed us all.

1413
01:20:07,740 --> 01:20:09,630
I knew wayne was the reason she moved away,

1414
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:13,300
And the second she moved back, he started stalking her again.

1415
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:16,500
She was always telling us how terrified she was.

1416
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:19,200
We always knew he'd do something like this eventually,

1417
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:21,170
And he did.

1418
01:20:30,310 --> 01:20:31,840
Look...

1419
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,300
This was obviously self-Defense.

1420
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:37,520
Take the cuffs off, get her to the hospital.

1421
01:20:55,310 --> 01:20:56,440
Mom?

1422
01:20:56,740 --> 01:20:57,670
Mom!

1423
01:20:57,830 --> 01:20:59,250
Oh,my!

1424
01:20:59,890 --> 01:21:02,070
I'm so sorry,mom.

1425
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:14,170
Five years later

1426
01:21:17,560 --> 01:21:18,710
There's a ritual

1427
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:21,240
My friends have observed for years.

1428
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,740
Once a week,they meet to play a game of cards

1429
01:21:23,900 --> 01:21:26,120
And talk about their lives.

1430
01:21:26,290 --> 01:21:29,030
Of course,there's another aspect to these gatherings

1431
01:21:29,200 --> 01:21:32,670
That has nothing to do with gossip or poker.

1432
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:35,610
Every seven days, my friends are reminded

1433
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:38,010
Of a basic human truth-

1434
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:42,500
There is nothing more important than friendships that endure,

1435
01:21:42,670 --> 01:21:47,020
Especially in a world that insists on changing.

1436
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:49,850
Okay,my friends are gone.

1437
01:21:50,030 --> 01:21:52,620
I'm ready to fix you dinner.

1438
01:21:53,470 --> 01:21:55,450
What the hell are you doing?!

1439
01:21:55,640 --> 01:21:58,660
Hey,mommy, we're playing fashion model!

1440
01:21:58,860 --> 01:22:01,070
Look at this mess!

1441
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:04,920
You are lucky i got in here before you touched my dresses!

1442
01:22:05,160 --> 01:22:07,140
Run,celia,run!

1443
01:22:08,040 --> 01:22:10,280
My vera wang?!

1444
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:13,930
I'm home!

1445
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:15,600
Oh,thank god.

1446
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,340
The publisher sent over the galley for the cookbook.

1447
01:22:17,510 --> 01:22:19,070
He needs you to proof them tonight.

1448
01:22:19,240 --> 01:22:20,800
I've also got the woman from "the new york times"

1449
01:22:20,960 --> 01:22:25,310
On the phone. She wants to do the interview now. Is that you,bree? The water's getting cold.

1450
01:22:25,490 --> 01:22:26,900
Uh,leave the galleys in my office and tell

1451
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:29,350
The woman from "the times" to call me back in the morning.

1452
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:32,440
I'm gonna have a nice bubble bath with my husband.

1453
01:22:32,610 --> 01:22:34,900
Coming,orson!

1454
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:39,260
Why is there a police car in our driveway?

1455
01:22:39,430 --> 01:22:41,090
I was telling your husband we just picked up your son.

1456
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:44,280
He broke into a car at the mall and took it for a joyride.

1457
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:47,820
Again? I am so sorry,officer.

1458
01:22:47,980 --> 01:22:50,300
We have talked to porter till we're blue in the face.

1459
01:22:50,470 --> 01:22:53,430
It's like he's determined to go back to juvenile hall.

1460
01:22:53,600 --> 01:22:56,120
Honey,it wasn't porter this time.

1461
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:58,820
They arrested preston.

1462
01:23:01,460 --> 01:23:03,820
It's me,mom. I'm back from paris.

1463
01:23:03,990 --> 01:23:06,460
It was just as gorgeous as you said it would be,

1464
01:23:06,620 --> 01:23:07,860
And you're not gonna believe this.

1465
01:23:08,030 --> 01:23:09,580
Bradley finally asked me to marry him

1466
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,730
Right there under the eiffel tower.

1467
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:14,480
I'm so happy. Call me back.

1468
01:23:19,730 --> 01:23:22,420
Honey? I'm home.

1469
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,720
Did you miss me?

1470
01:23:27,100 --> 01:23:28,650
You know i did.

1471
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:29,650
Mmm.

1472
01:23:29,820 --> 01:23:31,790
