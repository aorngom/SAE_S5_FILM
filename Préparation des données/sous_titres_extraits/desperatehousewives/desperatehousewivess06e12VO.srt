00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:02,706
<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,589
<i>In the wake of a tragedy,</i>

3
00:00:06,201 --> 00:00:07,882
<i>a daughter was safe...</i>

4
00:00:08,132 --> 00:00:10,040
You saved her life.
We owe you everything.

5
00:00:10,207 --> 00:00:11,612
<i>Orson was changed...</i>

6
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:14,055
There's a good chance
your husband's paralyzed.

7
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,086
<i>An unborn twin was gone...</i>

8
00:00:16,253 --> 00:00:17,470
We lost the baby...

9
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,473
but the other baby is fine.

10
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:23,315
- <i>And an ex-husband...</i>
- Karl didn't make it.

11
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,353
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Was dead.</i>

12
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:35,694
<i>A month after the
death of Karl Mayer,</i>

13
00:00:35,864 --> 00:00:39,034
<i>his family assembled
for the reading of his will.</i>

14
00:00:39,906 --> 00:00:43,619
<i>To each, Karl left something
to remember him by.</i>

15
00:00:44,753 --> 00:00:47,778
<i>To his great aunt,
he left a grand piano.</i>

16
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:52,309
<i>To his favorite cousin,
he left gold cuff links.</i>

17
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:57,042
<i>To his beloved daughter,
he left cash and securities.</i>

18
00:00:57,845 --> 00:01:01,657
<i>But Karl Mayer left his most
extraordinary possession of all</i>

19
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:06,086
<i>to someone who wasn't
expecting a thing.</i>

20
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:08,985
"And finally,
to my ex-wife, Susan Mayer..."

21
00:01:09,818 --> 00:01:10,946
That's me.

22
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,846
I was just here
to support my daughter.

23
00:01:15,013 --> 00:01:17,327
Seriously, I've been playing
hangman on my phone.

24
00:01:20,935 --> 00:01:23,947
- You were saying?
- "To my dearest Susie Q.,

25
00:01:24,114 --> 00:01:27,165
"who endured my infidelities
far longer than she should have,

26
00:01:27,732 --> 00:01:31,260
"years of cheating, betrayals
almost from the day we were married..."

27
00:01:31,427 --> 00:01:33,996
Can we skip to the part
where I get stuff?

28
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:37,801
Don't look at me like that.
You got the piano.

29
00:01:38,603 --> 00:01:41,106
"While I was never good
at hiding my affairs of the flesh,"

30
00:01:41,276 --> 00:01:43,583
"I'm ashamed to say
that I was more successful

31
00:01:43,753 --> 00:01:45,767
at concealing some
of my financial affairs."

32
00:01:46,115 --> 00:01:47,560
What does that mean?

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:50,271
I think dad hid money from you
when you were married.

34
00:01:51,845 --> 00:01:53,757
It's not money, exactly.

35
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:56,945
It seems your ex-husband was
part owner in a business.

36
00:01:58,456 --> 00:02:02,287
He was having affairs, ran a law firm
and he owned a secret business?

37
00:02:03,602 --> 00:02:06,252
Glad you're finally getting
a little rest.

38
00:02:07,098 --> 00:02:10,048
He specifically asks
that you keep an open mind.

39
00:02:10,657 --> 00:02:12,127
It's very successful.

40
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:16,972
If it's so successful,
why do I need to keep an open mind?

41
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:18,466
<i>Yes,</i>

42
00:02:18,726 --> 00:02:22,679
<i>Karl Mayer left his ex-wife
something to remember him by...</i>

43
00:02:27,541 --> 00:02:31,315
<i>Not that there was any
chance she wod forget him.</i>

00:02:48,131 --> 00:02:51,916
<i>All kinds of men go to
The Double D gentlemen's club.</i>

47
00:02:52,552 --> 00:02:54,853
<i>Frat boys looking for a thrill...</i>

48
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:58,840
<i>Soldiers looking to get lucky...</i>

49
00:02:59,499 --> 00:03:02,513
<i>CEOs looking to close a deal.</i>

50
00:03:03,402 --> 00:03:07,355
<i>Yes,
all kinds of men go to Double D's,</i>

51
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,678
<i>which can be very
upsetting to all kinds of women.</i>

52
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,358
Jimbo Rooney,
co-owner of Double D's.

53
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,279
I was real sad
to hear about Karl's passing.

54
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:23,120
He was a good man,

55
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,909
and he cared about each
and every one of these dancers.

56
00:03:26,169 --> 00:03:29,415
I'm sure.
Karl was always a big supporter

57
00:03:30,008 --> 00:03:31,107
of the arts.

58
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,792
So... Who do I speak to about

59
00:03:34,052 --> 00:03:36,753
selling my share
of herpes on parade?

60
00:03:37,013 --> 00:03:40,598
Are you sure you want to do that?
Business has been real good lately,

61
00:03:40,768 --> 00:03:43,760
especially since we started
topless karaoke tuesdays.

62
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,997
As lucrative an enterprise
as that seems...

63
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:49,496
Take a look around.
Have a drink.

64
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,703
And then if you want to sell,

65
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:54,187
you have your lawyer call me.

66
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:56,435
Look at that.

67
00:03:57,147 --> 00:04:00,565
You made the o's in "Rooney"
into boobs.

68
00:04:00,735 --> 00:04:02,705
- Lovely.
- You like that?

69
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,496
Wait till you see
my partner Vic's business card.

70
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:08,037
He took the "v,"
and he made it into a...

71
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,207
Got it.

72
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,246
I think
I'd really like that drink now.

73
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,334
Thanks, but I'm
not here for the show.

74
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:26,052
I just found out
that I own half this place.

75
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:28,859
No kiddin'.
Nice to meet you.

76
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:31,766
I'm Jennifer Morelli,
but at 10:00, I'm "Destiny."

77
00:04:32,588 --> 00:04:34,329
I'm Susan Delfino.

78
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,729
At 10:00, I am in
a flannel nightgown.

79
00:04:37,078 --> 00:04:39,149
We have a Delfino
that comes in here.

80
00:04:40,002 --> 00:04:41,002
Really?

81
00:04:41,396 --> 00:04:44,320
- It's a pretty common name.
- I think he's a plumber.

82
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:45,743
Really?

83
00:04:46,863 --> 00:04:49,338
Maybe there's another
plumber with that last name.

84
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:51,583
Mike, that's it.
Mike Delfino.

85
00:04:51,753 --> 00:04:54,289
Tall guy, brown hair, nice smile?

86
00:04:54,549 --> 00:04:55,832
Big busted nose?

87
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:57,333
I don't think so.

88
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:00,188
Wait till the next time you see him.

89
00:05:03,891 --> 00:05:07,197
A TV? You guys
didn't have to do that.

90
00:05:07,367 --> 00:05:09,680
- Yes, we absolutely did.
- We have a family rule,

91
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:13,652
save our daughter from being squashed
by a plane, you get a 60-inch plasma.

92
00:05:13,822 --> 00:05:16,679
And a faux leather remote caddy.

93
00:05:16,849 --> 00:05:19,342
Thanks.
This is very generous.

94
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:21,649
Please. We could never make up
for what you did.

95
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,058
Or for how I behaved toward you
the past couple of weeks.

96
00:05:25,228 --> 00:05:27,655
- I was such a bitch.
- We both said things.

97
00:05:27,915 --> 00:05:29,991
But I said a lot worse a lot louder.

98
00:05:30,532 --> 00:05:31,743
Yeah, you did.

99
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,213
By the way, I talked to HR, and
they are fine with continuing to pay you

100
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,750
until the baby is born
and for six weeks after that.

101
00:05:40,422 --> 00:05:43,838
That's amazing.
Will Terrence fill in until I get back?

102
00:05:44,098 --> 00:05:45,924
Actually, no.
He took the job in Miami.

103
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:47,759
So who's gonna take up the slack?

104
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,887
I'll put in extra hours,
work weekends.

105
00:05:52,054 --> 00:05:54,057
Don't worry about it.
You focus on that baby.

106
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:56,918
Really? I don't want to have
this fall on you.

107
00:05:57,088 --> 00:05:59,498
We gotta get going.
We've got Juanita's interview.

108
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,927
Right. Lynette,
do not worry. I got your back.

109
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:06,047
But I feel so guilty taking
your money and leaving you in the lurch.

110
00:06:06,954 --> 00:06:10,151
I got a crazy idea.
What if I fill in for Lynette?

111
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:14,072
- They're in a hurry. No time for jokes.
- I'm serious.

112
00:06:14,242 --> 00:06:17,234
I've done her job, or pretty damn
similar, when I was in advertising.

113
00:06:17,404 --> 00:06:19,916
I could step in for her
until she gets back on her feet.

114
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:22,502
But that's putting Carlos
in an awkward position.

115
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:25,257
- I think it's a great idea.
- Me, too.

116
00:06:26,856 --> 00:06:29,497
I think
it's a great idea, in theory,

117
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,986
But it's such a complicated job.

118
00:06:34,523 --> 00:06:36,099
You don't think I can handle it?

119
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:40,812
I think you'd be wonderful.

120
00:06:41,155 --> 00:06:44,065
Great, it's settled then.
Tom, you start tomorrow.

121
00:06:44,325 --> 00:06:46,859
There you go. Now you have
nothing to feel guilty about.

122
00:06:47,119 --> 00:06:48,119
Right.

123
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:49,637
Right.

124
00:06:51,582 --> 00:06:53,427
Thanks again for the tv.

125
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:56,320
You guys have been way too generous.

126
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:00,900
You made scones.

127
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,493
- My favorite.
- I know. Take as many as you like.

128
00:07:05,263 --> 00:07:06,263
So...

129
00:07:06,466 --> 00:07:08,172
What did you want to see me about?

130
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:12,681
I wanted to give you this
donation for the building fund.

131
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:15,607
And I also have some things
in the garage for the rummage sale,

132
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:17,621
and I am also available

133
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,476
to run the next
sunday school pancake breakfast.

134
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:24,439
Good heavens.
What a wonderful display

135
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:25,815
of christian charity.

136
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:28,359
I just want to do my part.

137
00:07:29,982 --> 00:07:32,884
Does this have anything to do
with the plane crash?

138
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:35,846
In a manner of speaking.

139
00:07:37,044 --> 00:07:38,536
Do you want to talk about it?

140
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:41,789
I can't. It would change
how you feel about me.

141
00:07:42,049 --> 00:07:45,248
I've known you for years.
I don't think that's possible.

142
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,921
I had an affair.

143
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:52,193
Are you okay?

144
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,939
Before you confess a sin that big,

145
00:07:57,538 --> 00:07:59,432
Just try to wait
till I've swallowed.

146
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,764
Who was the affair with?

147
00:08:06,301 --> 00:08:07,488
Karl Mayer.

148
00:08:09,494 --> 00:08:12,737
He was killed in the plane crash.
The same one that injured Orson.

149
00:08:13,152 --> 00:08:15,531
You must feel terribly guilty
about this.

150
00:08:16,225 --> 00:08:18,423
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

151
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:21,985
That's why I wanted you
to come over here.

152
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:25,458
I have to do something
to make this right.

153
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:28,594
Seems to me the first step
is for you and Orson

154
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:31,000
to get into
our marriage outreach program.

155
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,904
It's too late for that.
We're about to get a divorce.

156
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:37,345
But this was before Orson
was in a wheelchair, right?

157
00:08:37,967 --> 00:08:38,971
Yes.

158
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:42,936
I think you know what you need
to do to atone for this sin.

159
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:45,353
You knew it
before I walked in the door.

160
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,898
You want me to bring Orson home
and take care of him?

161
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,987
It's just that I'm not
sure that I love him anymore.

162
00:08:57,585 --> 00:08:59,650
There's a quote I've always loved.

163
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:04,997
"You cannot make yourself feel
something that you do not feel,

164
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,960
"but you can make yourself
do right in spite of your feelings."

165
00:09:10,111 --> 00:09:13,335
- I don't remember that from the Bible.
- It's from Pearl Buck.

166
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:15,133
I am allowed to read other books.

167
00:09:16,813 --> 00:09:20,596
No matter what you feel about Orson,
if you don't help him now,

168
00:09:21,199 --> 00:09:23,615
you won't be able
to live with yourself.

169
00:09:25,418 --> 00:09:26,418
Fine.

170
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:29,420
I'll tell Orson tomorrow,

171
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:31,399
and I'll bring him home.

172
00:09:32,086 --> 00:09:33,086
Good.

173
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,445
I think you've had enough.

174
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,036
- Hold up.
- Hey. What's going on?

175
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:47,957
Eddie's doing stand-up at
the Chuckle Zone on open Mike Night.

176
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:49,885
Stand-up?

177
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:51,544
As in comedy?

178
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,796
People are always
telling me how funny I am,

179
00:09:53,963 --> 00:09:56,233
so I decided to give
the people what they want.

180
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,774
Don't miss out. I got this
whole riff about airline food.

181
00:09:58,944 --> 00:10:00,011
It's gonna kill.

182
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Hold up!

183
00:10:04,692 --> 00:10:07,565
When they tell him he's funny,
doesn't he realize they're being funny?

184
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,146
Tell me you're going.
I can't be the only one there.

185
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,524
I'll try. I actually gotta pack.

186
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:17,361
My dad left me some money, so
I'm going back east to see my cousins.

187
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:18,946
For how long?

188
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:22,714
Until they catch the guy
who attacked me,

189
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:24,869
I just don't feel safe here.

190
00:10:26,123 --> 00:10:27,456
I get that.

191
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,543
I've been wanting
to ask you something.

192
00:10:33,242 --> 00:10:35,213
I heard you were in the hospital

193
00:10:35,473 --> 00:10:37,479
because of an overdose.

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,207
You didn't do that because of...

195
00:10:44,963 --> 00:10:46,963
I was dealing with a lot of stuff...

196
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:49,692
problems with my parents,
having to move again.

197
00:10:50,382 --> 00:10:52,057
I got really lonely.

198
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:55,358
And I guess you were part of it.

199
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,310
I'm better now.

200
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Good.

201
00:11:03,733 --> 00:11:06,369
Life has its low points, and we
just have to deal with them.

202
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:09,332
Speaking of which,

203
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,582
how do we get out of this?

204
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:16,828
Your timing is impeccable,

205
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:20,883
because it just so happens that
we have an opening right now.

206
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:23,456
Yes, we heard, and we're so excited.

207
00:11:23,626 --> 00:11:26,026
Everyone know, thhis is
the best private school in town.

208
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:29,166
It says here that you have been
homeschooling Juanita.

209
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:31,441
How's that been going?

210
00:11:32,212 --> 00:11:35,836
It's been so rewarding spending
time with my little angel.

211
00:11:36,433 --> 00:11:38,734
It breaks my heart to see it end.

212
00:11:38,994 --> 00:11:41,862
Anyway, here's her lunch. It's
all packed. We'll pick her up at 4:00.

213
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:45,502
Wait, just a second.

214
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:49,162
There are a few other families
on the waiting list before you.

215
00:11:51,449 --> 00:11:54,595
- There are?
- Yes, but Susan Delfino

216
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:57,128
gave you such
a glowing recommendation.

217
00:11:57,901 --> 00:11:59,509
And to be quite frank,

218
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:02,509
we could use a little more
diversity in this school.

219
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:05,970
It's been quite a long time since we've
had a little girl of Mexican descent.

220
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:09,942
We are very proud of our heritage...

221
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:13,024
but Juanita can stand on her own merits.
She's very bright.

222
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,319
And I know I'm biased, but I
do think she's a budding young genius.

223
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:19,275
I'm Mexican?

224
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,824
- Honey, what did you just say?
- He called me Mexican.

225
00:12:27,084 --> 00:12:29,452
You are Mexican, honey.
You know that.

226
00:12:30,315 --> 00:12:32,246
Since when?
I thought we were American.

227
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:37,460
Yes, but our ancestors
came from <i>Mexico.</i>

228
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,067
Really?

229
00:12:40,234 --> 00:12:43,907
So we're like those people who
sell oranges on the side of the road?

230
00:12:45,835 --> 00:12:49,090
- You're busy. We should go.
- Thank you very much for your time.

231
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:52,815
And, again, we really want to join
you and help with that diversity thing,

232
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:54,485
so just let us know.

233
00:12:56,926 --> 00:12:59,172
<i>- Just say it.
- I don't even know what that means.</i>

234
00:12:59,342 --> 00:13:00,442
<i>Just say it!</i>

235
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:11,597
This is fine.
Thank you.

236
00:13:13,982 --> 00:13:15,665
Thank you for agreeing to see me.

237
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,876
I called a few times,
but you didn't pick up.

238
00:13:19,627 --> 00:13:20,951
I had no idea.

239
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:24,632
My phone was in my pants pocket,
and I had it on vibrate.

240
00:13:24,892 --> 00:13:27,614
And as you may have noticed, I...

241
00:13:29,769 --> 00:13:31,555
So how's rehab?

242
00:13:32,091 --> 00:13:33,091
Painful.

243
00:13:33,499 --> 00:13:36,936
The doctor says with a lot of hard work,
you maybe able to walk again someday.

244
00:13:37,196 --> 00:13:39,765
Yes, they're very upbeat
and optimistic.

245
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,608
I want to run them over
with this chair.

246
00:13:43,969 --> 00:13:45,847
So...
Why are you here?

247
00:13:47,264 --> 00:13:51,226
I know we've been through a lot, but
it would be best for you to come home

248
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:53,111
so I can take care of you.

249
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:58,958
I'd rather be cared for
by a flatulent helper monkey.

250
00:13:59,218 --> 00:14:01,252
I know you're angry,
but I'm still your wife.

251
00:14:01,512 --> 00:14:04,121
Apparently we have different
definitions of the word "wife."

252
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:05,923
I am proceeding with the divorce.

253
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:09,510
I don't understand. Three weeks ago
you were begging me for another chance.

254
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:13,409
- What happened?
- Karl Mayer happened.

255
00:14:14,064 --> 00:14:17,476
I could forgive you If you betrayed
me with anyone remotely admirable,

256
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:21,230
but you chose the most
contemptible man I have ever known.

257
00:14:23,283 --> 00:14:24,598
I do not need you.

258
00:14:36,914 --> 00:14:40,499
I'm having a ramp built, and I've turned
the downstairs study into your bedroom.

259
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:44,258
You're coming home where you belong,
and that's all there is to it.

260
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:47,583
You can start forgiving me,
and I'll start forgiving you.

261
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:54,769
I suggest you start first.

262
00:14:58,542 --> 00:15:02,146
How could you not know you're Mexican?
We eat Mexican all the time.

263
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:05,232
We eat Chinese food, too.
Does that mean I'm Chinese?

264
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:07,526
No, that just means
your mother hates to cook.

265
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:15,993
Apparently, we have to
spell everything out for you.

266
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,026
You do know you're a girl, right?

267
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:20,560
What? Half the women
in your family have mustaches.

268
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:22,541
It could be very confusing.

269
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:27,379
Juanita, go inside
and play with your sister.

270
00:15:28,339 --> 00:15:30,841
And while you're at it,
tell her she's Mexican, too!

271
00:15:33,635 --> 00:15:34,909
I can't believe it.

272
00:15:35,079 --> 00:15:38,231
We had that school right in our hands.
How could we let it get away?

273
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:41,435
The bigger question is how did we let
our daughter thinking she's white?

274
00:16:02,414 --> 00:16:05,834
Sorry I'm late. I had to pick up some
lumber to build that ramp for Orson.

275
00:16:06,004 --> 00:16:08,115
What a good person you are.

276
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:10,591
I need to pay the paperboy tomorrow.

277
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,634
- Do you have any cash?
- I think I have a $20 on me.

278
00:16:16,281 --> 00:16:18,055
Wouldn't you rather...

279
00:16:18,591 --> 00:16:19,890
Stick it in here?

280
00:16:20,888 --> 00:16:23,310
Couldn't we leave it in the mailbox,
like we usually do?

281
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:27,022
I just thought that's the
way you do it down at Double D's.

282
00:16:27,766 --> 00:16:28,816
Double D's?

283
00:16:29,243 --> 00:16:32,069
Turns out Karl was a part owner
and left me his share.

284
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:33,696
By the way,

285
00:16:34,514 --> 00:16:36,365
"Destiny" says hello.

286
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,910
I see where you're going with this.

287
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,372
Do you, Mike Delfino?
That's what she calls you.

288
00:16:44,049 --> 00:16:45,791
Because that's my name.

289
00:16:46,051 --> 00:16:49,177
No one hanging from a pole
should know your name.

290
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:51,255
That place is one of my accounts.

291
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:52,840
I'm their plumber.

292
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,771
And that's it? You go there just
to do the plumbing and nothing else?

293
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,389
Liar! Destiny said you had
a beer there the other night.

294
00:17:02,213 --> 00:17:04,983
Sometimes when I finish the job,
I'll have a beer.

295
00:17:05,686 --> 00:17:07,912
And you never look at the girls?

296
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:13,551
- It's completely innocent.
- I don't buy that.

297
00:17:13,721 --> 00:17:17,133
I want to see the "completely
innocent" look you have

298
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:19,852
when Destiny shakes her tassels
in your face.

299
00:17:20,022 --> 00:17:21,744
So I've gone to a strip club.

300
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,084
Are we gonna laugh about this,
or make it a thing?

301
00:17:24,622 --> 00:17:26,457
I am leaning towards "thing."

302
00:17:26,811 --> 00:17:28,708
Fine. If it bothers you that much,

303
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:31,475
next time I finish a job there,
I'll come right home.

304
00:17:31,645 --> 00:17:34,841
You don't have to worry, because
you won't be working there anymore.

305
00:17:35,008 --> 00:17:36,008
I forbid it.

306
00:17:38,022 --> 00:17:39,219
You forbid it?

307
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:42,309
What kind of marriage is this?

308
00:17:42,976 --> 00:17:45,981
The kind where the husband
wants to look at strippers

309
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,931
and the wife forbids it.

310
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,235
I love you.

311
00:17:50,639 --> 00:17:53,439
I have never cheated on you
and I never will.

312
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:57,436
But you're not gonna tell me
what I can or can't do.

313
00:18:00,465 --> 00:18:02,165
Let me get this straight...

314
00:18:03,225 --> 00:18:05,626
You forbid Mike
from going to a strip club?

315
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,041
I know it was a little heavy-handed,
but I just can't stand those places.

316
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,524
What's the big whoop? Carlos takes
clients to the strip club all the time.

317
00:18:12,691 --> 00:18:14,014
I've been to one...

318
00:18:14,289 --> 00:18:15,756
the Ass Menagerie.

319
00:18:16,754 --> 00:18:19,537
It was my brother's bachelor party.
This stripper named Cinnamon

320
00:18:19,707 --> 00:18:20,928
gave me a lap dance.

321
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:25,103
Luckily, if I squinted just enough,
she looked like a young Ricky Schroder.

322
00:18:25,273 --> 00:18:27,524
See, this is the reason
men go to those places...

323
00:18:27,694 --> 00:18:29,728
so they can fantasize.
We all do it.

324
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:32,356
You fantasize about other men
when you're with Carlos?

325
00:18:32,616 --> 00:18:34,386
Carlos has been
so many different men,

326
00:18:34,553 --> 00:18:36,860
I'm surprised when
I open my eyes and it's Carlos.

327
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:40,480
Wanna know who I fantasize about?

328
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:43,033
Not necessarily.
Anyone want more wine?

329
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:44,493
Tom Scavo.

330
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:46,125
Wine now.

331
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,288
4th of July barbecue.

332
00:18:48,548 --> 00:18:49,873
Those tan shorts.

333
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,683
I am there right now.

334
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:55,963
Could we please get back
to the issue at hand?

335
00:18:56,645 --> 00:18:59,464
Bottom line is you cannot
forbid a man to go to strip clubs.

336
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:01,829
Don't expect him to
understand why it bothers you.

337
00:19:01,996 --> 00:19:04,096
That's just the way they are.
Right?

338
00:19:06,519 --> 00:19:09,092
Sorry. I was just imagining
Ricky Schroder...

339
00:19:09,262 --> 00:19:11,364
wearing Tom Scavo's shorts.

340
00:19:17,835 --> 00:19:19,996
Are you sure you want
to just give away your CDs?

341
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:22,278
The more you take,
the less I have to pack.

342
00:19:22,448 --> 00:19:24,476
In fact,
is there anything else you want?

343
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:25,729
Anything?

344
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:29,084
How about...

345
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:30,706
Danny Bolen?

346
00:19:31,247 --> 00:19:32,995
He's not really mine to give.

347
00:19:33,162 --> 00:19:35,002
Come on.
He's totally into you,

348
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,432
Which is a complete mystery to me.

349
00:19:38,942 --> 00:19:41,325
You know what? I think
I'm just gonna keep my CDs.

350
00:19:41,492 --> 00:19:44,683
I didn't mean it like that.
It's just you don't seem interested,

351
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:47,389
and I have sent every signal
I can think of.

352
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:50,893
- Why are you so hung up on Danny?
- He's hot.

353
00:19:52,895 --> 00:19:56,318
Here's the thing, Danny's
in kind of a fragile place right now.

354
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:58,442
He doesn't need
to get his heart broken.

355
00:19:58,702 --> 00:20:01,582
I'm not gonna snag him
just to toss him aside.

356
00:20:02,006 --> 00:20:03,280
I don't use people.

357
00:20:05,825 --> 00:20:07,712
I used some people.

358
00:20:08,346 --> 00:20:09,980
But I wouldn't use him.

359
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:13,683
Are you sure?

360
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:17,009
I think we have a lot in common,
and if he'd just spend

361
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:19,590
a little time with me,
he'd realize that.

362
00:20:22,932 --> 00:20:24,259
You like stand-up comedy?

363
00:20:25,897 --> 00:20:28,147
Too bad.
We're gonna go see Eddie.

364
00:20:35,396 --> 00:20:36,646
Sorry I'm late.

365
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,279
- How was work?
- Crazy.

366
00:20:40,429 --> 00:20:42,703
I had three conference calls

367
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:45,670
and a 2-hour client
meeting with Gary Danner.

368
00:20:45,996 --> 00:20:48,639
- How was your day?
- Even crazier.

369
00:20:48,806 --> 00:20:51,125
I peed twice in every
bathroom in the house.

370
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,760
What's that?

371
00:20:53,668 --> 00:20:55,838
Little matching outfits
for the twins

372
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:59,424
that people gave us.
I thought I'd give them to charity.

373
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,830
I ran into the Petersons today.

374
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,848
They just heard, wanted
to see how you were.

375
00:21:08,439 --> 00:21:10,127
So Gary Danner...

376
00:21:10,678 --> 00:21:12,604
He's a prickly S.O.B.

377
00:21:14,662 --> 00:21:16,012
Tell me about it.

378
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:18,318
Check out this proposal
I worked up for him.

379
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,254
- What do you mean, "hmm"?
- I'm glad you showed this to me.

380
00:21:26,421 --> 00:21:29,663
I know Danner. And trust me,
you do not want to go down this road.

381
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,207
- Why not?
- Don't worry. I can fix it.

382
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,271
- Where's a pen?
- Wait... Actually...

383
00:21:34,438 --> 00:21:37,004
I showed it to Danner today.
He loved it.

384
00:21:37,939 --> 00:21:39,256
Gary Danner liked this?

385
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:41,216
No, he loved it,

386
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:45,180
But not as much as Carlos. He told me
it was the best written proposal

387
00:21:45,347 --> 00:21:47,222
he has ever seen, bar none.

388
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,268
- What's for dinner?
- Meat loaf.

389
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:56,499
What's wrong?

390
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:59,484
Nothing. It's... Well,
that's quite a compliment.

391
00:22:00,943 --> 00:22:03,322
Not to mention a bit of a slam
on the work that I did.

392
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,494
Honey, he's just encouraging me.

393
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:08,561
I don't think he was
thinking about you at all.

394
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,283
By the way, this meat loaf...

395
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:14,447
The best I have ever tasted.

396
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,659
Bar none?
Just eat.

397
00:22:25,957 --> 00:22:27,807
It's coming along beautifully.

398
00:22:27,974 --> 00:22:30,098
Thanks. So,
when's Orson coming home?

399
00:22:31,243 --> 00:22:32,768
It's still a bit up in the air.

400
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,442
But I guess now would be
a good time to call him

401
00:22:36,609 --> 00:22:38,909
and let him know we're almost ready.

402
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:43,784
Orson Hodge's room, please.

403
00:22:44,909 --> 00:22:47,359
Would you stop
hammering for a moment?

404
00:22:49,757 --> 00:22:51,007
He checked out?

405
00:22:51,566 --> 00:22:54,238
But that's impossible.
Where would he have gone?

406
00:22:54,405 --> 00:22:56,625
- Mike, please.
- It's not me.

407
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,476
Never mind. I think I found him.

408
00:23:07,155 --> 00:23:09,820
Oh, boy. The fat's in the fire now.

409
00:23:11,197 --> 00:23:12,432
What is going on here?

410
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,977
The husband you're
divorcing has found new digs.

411
00:23:15,452 --> 00:23:17,104
Before you jump down my throat...

412
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,243
Roy and I are on fixed incomes.

413
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:21,406
You can't blame us for
taking in a boarder,

414
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:23,717
especially one who can't
get to the second story.

415
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:25,529
That's our naked floor.

416
00:23:33,548 --> 00:23:34,913
What are you doing here?

417
00:23:36,318 --> 00:23:37,868
Enjoying my new home.

418
00:23:38,491 --> 00:23:40,006
It's rather quaint,

419
00:23:40,173 --> 00:23:42,754
once you get used to the smell
of denture cream and scotch.

420
00:23:45,572 --> 00:23:46,772
Don't mind me.

421
00:23:48,168 --> 00:23:50,846
Just making sure you don't
slap a guy in a wheelchair.

422
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:54,725
So how are you planning
to pay your rent?

423
00:23:55,104 --> 00:23:57,819
Well, I'm a bit cash-strapped
at the moment, but,

424
00:23:57,986 --> 00:23:59,596
Karen knows I'm good for it.

425
00:23:59,763 --> 00:24:03,066
Once he gets his divorce settlement,
he's writing me a big, fat check.

426
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:06,843
So how long are we talking?
A month, two?

427
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,693
There will be no divorce, and
if he tries to file for one,

428
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,341
there will be delays,
motions and appeals.

429
00:24:13,508 --> 00:24:16,408
It could take years for
him to ever see a dime.

430
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,308
Your wife loves you. Go home.

431
00:24:23,506 --> 00:24:25,556
Stop right now. Do you hear me?

432
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,873
So am I taking down the ramp?

433
00:24:31,159 --> 00:24:32,159
Leave it.

434
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,571
You'll need it soon enough.

435
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,341
Almost home, dear.

436
00:24:36,508 --> 00:24:39,708
Mike, call the police. My
wife is holding me hostage!

437
00:24:40,026 --> 00:24:42,026
We've all been there, big guy.

438
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:50,937
I had an appointment with
my O.B. around the corner,

439
00:24:51,104 --> 00:24:53,272
and I just thought
I'd stop by and say hi.

440
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,876
I also wanted to

441
00:24:56,154 --> 00:24:58,154
thank you for being so nice to

442
00:24:58,521 --> 00:25:00,373
Tom, our little temp.

443
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:02,459
- How's he doing?
- He's amazing.

444
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,672
It's okay, Carlos.
You can tell me the truth.

445
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:11,301
He's knocking my socks off.
Everybody is so impressed.

446
00:25:12,046 --> 00:25:13,553
Well, good.

447
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,388
Good, good, good.

448
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,055
I'm so proud of him.

449
00:25:17,767 --> 00:25:20,268
But when I drop this kid,
Tom's out on his ass, right?

450
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,854
- Excuse me?
- I love him and

451
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:26,862
I'm glad he's doing well here,
but this is my job.

452
00:25:27,029 --> 00:25:29,569
At some point,
I'm gonna want it back.

453
00:25:29,933 --> 00:25:31,905
And I say that as the woman

454
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:35,450
who dove in front of a spinning
propeller to save your child's life.

455
00:25:38,185 --> 00:25:40,035
Of course this is your job.

456
00:25:40,895 --> 00:25:43,792
And you can have it
back any time you want.

457
00:25:45,186 --> 00:25:46,795
Well, that's all I needed to hear.

458
00:25:47,932 --> 00:25:49,840
It's just that I was
under the impression

459
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,409
you were planning to stay
at home with your baby.

460
00:25:56,493 --> 00:25:59,193
And why would you be
under that impression?

461
00:26:00,648 --> 00:26:01,893
That's what Tom said.

462
00:26:03,873 --> 00:26:06,815
What exactly did tom say?

463
00:26:08,528 --> 00:26:11,153
I really don't want to get
in the middle of this.

464
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,288
Carlos, I saved
a member of your family.

465
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:15,782
It doesn't mean I can't
take another one out.

466
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,798
And you can train a dog to do
almost anything, but you can't do,

467
00:26:21,965 --> 00:26:23,643
you can't do with cats and... cats.

468
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:27,121
And did you ever try to get a cat
to fetch? They're like, you know,

469
00:26:27,288 --> 00:26:30,964
they won't do it.
Stupid cats. Am I right, people?

470
00:26:35,414 --> 00:26:37,888
You guys have been great.
Good night.

471
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,662
Give it up for Eddie Orlofsky

472
00:26:40,829 --> 00:26:42,079
Come on, folks!

473
00:26:45,925 --> 00:26:47,891
So, what do you think?

474
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,819
I never realized there were so many
differences between dogs and cats.

475
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:55,363
That's why I'm the comic, babe.

476
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,840
I'm off to get my free drink.

477
00:27:07,113 --> 00:27:09,273
I left my jacket in
the car. Walk me out?

478
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,590
Jacket? It's hot as hell in here.

479
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,216
Now I feel a chill.

480
00:27:26,339 --> 00:27:27,979
I gotta use the bathroom.

481
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,524
Okay, what is your problem?

482
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,068
Excuse me?

483
00:27:33,461 --> 00:27:36,418
Whenever we're alone together,
you find some reason to bail.

484
00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:38,031
Why aren't you into me?

485
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:41,859
Ana, there's not a lot
of room to be into you.

486
00:27:42,026 --> 00:27:43,954
Because of how much you're into you.

487
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,581
You did not just call me conceited.

488
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,251
Chill. It's not like
I asked you to spell it.

489
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,650
I'm not stupid,

490
00:27:51,817 --> 00:27:54,673
and I am definitely not
the attention whore at this table.

491
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,010
I heard about your little
stunt with the pills.

492
00:28:01,779 --> 00:28:03,279
Okay, that was mean.

493
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:05,225
I'm sorry that I said that.

494
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,520
Don't be sorry.

495
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,689
You're right.

496
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,487
I like the blunt Ana

497
00:28:18,041 --> 00:28:19,691
more than the cute Ana.

498
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:23,710
So...

499
00:28:24,293 --> 00:28:25,743
you think I'm cute?

500
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,540
You're home. Perfect timing.

501
00:28:34,784 --> 00:28:38,593
- Margaritas. What's the occasion?
- We're getting drunk, Mexican style.

502
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,710
Principal Hobson just called,

503
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,033
and Juanita got accepted
to Oakridge.

504
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,953
- Seriously?
- I am free from homeschooling.

505
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,050
No more fighting, no more threats,

506
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:51,170
and no more parent-teacher
conferences with you.

507
00:28:56,157 --> 00:28:59,154
- Come on. Start guzzlin'.
- I don't think she should go.

508
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,122
I've been thinking about it all day.

509
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:12,042
- Let's keep her in public school.
- We can't. She was expelled.

510
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,587
I made some calls.
Jefferson elementary can take her.

511
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:16,254
That's way out in my pleasant.

512
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,987
And there's a lot of Latino families
that live in that area.

513
00:29:19,154 --> 00:29:21,926
So what? We have a much better
school right here in our backyard.

514
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:25,733
I'm not schlepping way over there
just so she can be with those people.

515
00:29:27,019 --> 00:29:28,335
"Those" people?

516
00:29:28,914 --> 00:29:30,727
Don't you mean "our" people?

517
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:34,689
Our people are
the rich private school people.

518
00:29:35,406 --> 00:29:38,151
Oh, my God. I know exactly
what is going on here.

519
00:29:38,645 --> 00:29:41,821
- What?
- You are ashamed of being Mexican.

520
00:29:42,328 --> 00:29:44,657
- That's insane.
- No, it totally makes sense.

521
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,368
All of our friends are white.

522
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:48,704
You didn't want me
to teach the girls Spanish.

523
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:52,165
Because I don't understand it, I didn't
want you guys plotting behind my back.

524
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,498
When we bought this house
and I said we would be

525
00:29:54,665 --> 00:29:56,741
the only Mexicans,
you remember what you said?

526
00:29:56,908 --> 00:29:59,022
- "Fine by me."
- You're right. It's my fault.

527
00:29:59,189 --> 00:30:02,093
I should have told the realtor,
"Forget square footage and central air.

528
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,729
Find us something next
door to a Mariachi bar."

529
00:30:04,896 --> 00:30:07,639
Deny it all you want.
You are a self-hating Mexican.

530
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:11,160
- Well, you're a self-wiping Mexican.
- What does that mean?

531
00:30:21,922 --> 00:30:23,697
Traffic was insane.

532
00:30:25,262 --> 00:30:27,784
Is there any dinner left?
I haven't eaten since lunch.

533
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,150
- Everything okay?
- I talked to Carlos today.

534
00:30:35,357 --> 00:30:36,376
About what?

535
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:40,056
He was under the impression
that when I have this baby,

536
00:30:40,223 --> 00:30:42,223
I'll be staying home with her.

537
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,927
Where would he get a
crazy idea like that?

538
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,555
I told him.

539
00:30:50,132 --> 00:30:51,558
You're not even denying it?

540
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,352
I thought it might be
in your best interest.

541
00:30:54,968 --> 00:30:55,968
Seriously?

542
00:30:56,863 --> 00:30:59,649
You know how much
that job means to me.

543
00:31:00,111 --> 00:31:03,355
You know how much I hate
being a stay-at-home Mom.

544
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:05,572
How could you think
I'd be okay with this?

545
00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,340
Because we lost a baby.

546
00:31:14,804 --> 00:31:17,375
Honey, I thought you might want
to stay home with this one,

547
00:31:18,594 --> 00:31:21,504
because she's all the more precious,
given what happened.

548
00:31:24,328 --> 00:31:26,259
So that's how I'm supposed to feel.

549
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:31,181
I don't know how you feel Lynette,
because you never talk about it.

550
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:34,540
It's been a month.
Every time I try to bring it up,

551
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:37,103
- you change the subject.
- Because I'm dealing with it.

552
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,355
Shouldn't we
be dealing with it together?

553
00:31:39,605 --> 00:31:41,121
You want to talk about this?

554
00:31:41,288 --> 00:31:43,643
Fine! We lost a kid,
we'll never meet him.

555
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,970
We'll spend the rest of
our lives looking at one,

556
00:31:46,137 --> 00:31:47,965
always wondering
why there aren't two.

557
00:31:48,132 --> 00:31:50,682
How can saying this
out loud be helpful?

558
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,560
You're right. It's not.

559
00:32:02,438 --> 00:32:03,438
You win.

560
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:06,849
After you have the baby,

561
00:32:07,366 --> 00:32:08,635
go back to your job.

562
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,250
Thank you.

563
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,880
You want me to fix you something?

564
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,982
I'm not hungry anymore.

565
00:32:29,672 --> 00:32:32,825
<i>Now remember, fellas,
these ladies don't work for free.</i>

566
00:32:39,745 --> 00:32:40,917
Long time no see.

567
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,328
I got the call about
your John being backed up.

568
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:46,047
What? No, our bathrooms
are working just fine.

569
00:32:46,467 --> 00:32:49,175
That's weird. Some woman called
and said it was an emergency.

570
00:32:51,134 --> 00:32:53,635
I'm sorry, man.
I don't know what to tell you.

571
00:32:53,802 --> 00:32:56,353
<i>All right, it's time to introduce</i>

572
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,608
<i>our newest double D doll...</i>

573
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,418
<i>Miss Fix-it!</i>

574
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:11,350
What the hell?

575
00:33:20,019 --> 00:33:22,750
- What are you doing here?
- What the hell are you doing?

576
00:33:24,431 --> 00:33:26,855
Well, since I'm one of the owners,

577
00:33:27,349 --> 00:33:29,924
I figured I should
really learn the business,

578
00:33:30,366 --> 00:33:32,025
from my bottom up.

579
00:33:33,267 --> 00:33:36,017
You mind?
I'm trying to make a deposit here.

580
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,570
Will you come down
from there right now?

581
00:33:40,737 --> 00:33:42,537
Why? They're just looking.

582
00:33:42,704 --> 00:33:44,856
It's completely innocent. Right?

583
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:51,505
Hey, pal. Sit down. I didn't come here
to see the back of your head.

584
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,781
This is not funny.

585
00:33:54,892 --> 00:33:57,952
I can't talk. I've got a room full
of Neanderthals to entertain.

586
00:34:03,691 --> 00:34:07,141
- What are you doing?
- Just giving people what they want.

587
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:13,384
Don't you dare. Susan, I'm serious.
I want you off of that stage right now.

588
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:16,346
Wait. Are you forbidding
me from doing something?

589
00:34:17,975 --> 00:34:20,096
I thought we didn't have
that kind of marriage.

590
00:34:20,263 --> 00:34:23,102
Very cute. If I have to, I will
carry you out of here myself.

591
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,804
What exactly is the problem, Mike?

592
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,825
Okay. I get it. I will never...

593
00:34:38,075 --> 00:34:39,327
come back here.

594
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,266
Let's go home, Mrs. Fix-it.

595
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:50,663
Wait. Wait. Forgot my tips!

596
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,456
What are you looking at?

597
00:35:26,786 --> 00:35:29,304
Nothing. Just some old photos.

598
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:33,550
I didn't know you had these.

599
00:35:34,377 --> 00:35:35,970
We couldn't afford frames,

600
00:35:36,137 --> 00:35:39,087
so my dad would put these
on the wall with tape.

601
00:35:41,332 --> 00:35:42,432
Is that you?

602
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:45,419
I was about 5.

603
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:47,533
You're cute.

604
00:35:47,942 --> 00:35:50,342
But that toolshed's
seen better days.

605
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,290
That was our house.

606
00:36:01,436 --> 00:36:02,486
It's funny.

607
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:05,038
I'm smiling in all of
these photos, but...

608
00:36:07,270 --> 00:36:08,670
I hated that town.

609
00:36:10,495 --> 00:36:13,295
Everybody was so poor.
Everybody was Mexican.

610
00:36:16,146 --> 00:36:18,946
Back then I thought
they were the same thing.

611
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:24,290
And even though I was only 5,
I knew I wanted out.

612
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:30,062
And you can call it
self-loathing, Carlos, but,

613
00:36:31,219 --> 00:36:32,219
I just...

614
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,550
don't want my kids to ever
know I lived like that.

615
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,120
That's your dad.

616
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,570
He was so strong.

617
00:36:48,970 --> 00:36:51,138
I would run to meet him
when he'd come home

618
00:36:51,305 --> 00:36:54,457
from working in the factories,
and he'd lift me up on his shoulders.

619
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:57,480
I loved that.

620
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,950
I bet he did, too.

621
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,900
I used to ask him, "Papa,
why do you work so much?"

622
00:37:07,297 --> 00:37:09,111
And he would say, "so one day

623
00:37:09,278 --> 00:37:11,478
we can live in a beautiful house."

624
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,320
But we never did.

625
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,310
But you do now.

626
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,470
Your father had dreams, Gaby,

627
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:32,560
but they were for you, and
he sacrificed a lot to get you here.

628
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:39,160
Whatever our children
achieve in life,

629
00:37:40,129 --> 00:37:42,064
it's because of dreams that started

630
00:37:42,231 --> 00:37:45,231
on the shoulders of a
proud, strong, Mexican man.

631
00:37:47,402 --> 00:37:50,802
That is why I want our kids
to know where they came from.

632
00:37:55,293 --> 00:37:56,643
I want that, too.

633
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,300
So...

634
00:38:12,029 --> 00:38:14,417
How do your physical
therapists think you're doing?

635
00:38:18,569 --> 00:38:20,464
Do they think
you're making progress?

636
00:38:28,669 --> 00:38:32,143
Orson, it's been three days. You're
gonna have to talk to me sometime.

637
00:38:33,752 --> 00:38:35,688
I know why you're doing this, Bree.

638
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:40,401
Reverend Sykes stopped by
to check on my progress.

639
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,783
He was very proud of himself

640
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:45,950
for convincing you to
take me on as charity work.

641
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,320
It's not charity work.

642
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:51,618
When I had that affair,
I didn't just betray you.

643
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:53,205
I betrayed my faith as well.

644
00:38:54,287 --> 00:38:57,460
So please, you have to let me
help you or I am...

645
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,587
Or you won't get into heaven?

646
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,926
Didn't realize how
much this means to you.

647
00:39:07,731 --> 00:39:10,131
I guess I can find
a way to be happy.

648
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,950
Thank you so much, Orson.

649
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:16,270
I am gonna take
such good care of you.

650
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:22,443
By the way, my soup is cold.

651
00:39:24,271 --> 00:39:25,271
Well,

652
00:39:25,673 --> 00:39:26,864
mine is hot.

653
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,520
You can have this.

654
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,294
While you're up, could you
get me a glass of wine?

655
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,240
Yes, of course.

656
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,900
And perhaps for dessert,

657
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,590
some of your delicious Crème brûlée.

658
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:51,180
Orson, that takes over
an hour to prepare...

659
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:54,042
Well, I would do it myself, but...

660
00:40:04,522 --> 00:40:06,572
And we're out of vanilla beans.

661
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,880
You might have to run to the store.

662
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:33,153
<i>The act itself</i>

663
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,821
<i>is quite simple...</i>

664
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:37,767
<i>You strip away the outer layer</i>

665
00:40:37,995 --> 00:40:40,420
<i>and reveal what's underneath.</i>

666
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:42,613
<i>Of course,</i>

667
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:46,556
<i>sometimes the results
can be quite surprising.</i>

668
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:52,021
<i>If you strip away the veneer
of happy domesticity,</i>

669
00:40:52,663 --> 00:40:54,694
<i>you may find grief.</i>

670
00:40:56,724 --> 00:40:59,413
<i>If you strip away
that facade of wealth,</i>

671
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,614
<i>you may find self-loathing.</i>

672
00:41:04,588 --> 00:41:08,429
<i>If you strip away
the veil of helplessness,</i>

673
00:41:09,541 --> 00:41:12,113
<i>you may find cruelty.</i>

674
00:41:14,838 --> 00:41:16,709
<i>Yes, stripping</i>

675
00:41:16,876 --> 00:41:18,964
<i>can be a dangerous pastime.</i>

676
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,030
<i>But for a lucky few,</i>

677
00:41:23,548 --> 00:41:25,000
<i>it can also be...</i>
