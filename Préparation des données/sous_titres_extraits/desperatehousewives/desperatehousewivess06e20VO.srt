<i>Previously
on Desperate Housewives...</i>

2
00:00:03,005 --> 00:00:04,880
<i>A mother protected her son.</i>

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:07,132
Here in America,
we actually get divorced

4
00:00:07,382 --> 00:00:10,405
- before we get married again.
- I will explain it all away.

5
00:00:10,922 --> 00:00:13,513
Your father told me
you called off the wedding.

6
00:00:14,806 --> 00:00:17,091
<i>Evil came to Wisteria lane.</i>

7
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:19,929
- Susan, how is she?
- We don't know yet.

8
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:22,946
- Nobody's talking to us.
- <i>It struck again...</i>

9
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,567
- Can't believe she's dead.
- I didn't know her

10
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,569
but I guess we're
sorta connected now.

11
00:00:27,819 --> 00:00:30,113
- You would've liked her.
- <i>And fear set in.</i>

12
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,240
Whoever attacked Julie
is still out there.

13
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,090
There is obviously a
madman on the loose.

14
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,329
<i>The stage was set...</i>

15
00:00:39,045 --> 00:00:41,249
I'm a little out of your league,
don't you think?

16
00:00:41,718 --> 00:00:43,068
<i>For the killer...</i>

17
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:45,045
What are you doing?

18
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:46,755
<i>To strike again.</i>

19
00:00:53,479 --> 00:00:56,371
<i>There is a house
in the town of Fairview.</i>

20
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,098
<i>Inside this house lives a monster...</i>

21
00:01:00,456 --> 00:01:03,331
<i>The kind who kills young women.</i>

22
00:01:05,208 --> 00:01:08,909
<i>You may ask how such
a monster came to be,</i>

23
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:13,587
<i>and that's a very
good question, indeed.</i>

24
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:17,283
I'm out of scotch.

25
00:01:18,851 --> 00:01:20,897
I'll buy you some more
while I'm out.

26
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,814
You got any in your room?

27
00:01:23,703 --> 00:01:25,503
No. And stay out of there.

28
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:28,333
I know you've been
stealing my booze.

29
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,200
Stop being so paranoid.
I don't even drink.

30
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:35,231
- Sure you don't.
- I gotta help Mrs. Scavo fix her car.

31
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,486
You can wait a little while, right?

32
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:50,289
<i>His name was Eddie.</i>

33
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:55,627
<i>Everyone thought he was harmless...</i>

34
00:01:58,987 --> 00:02:02,497
<i>Until the day his mother
went into his room.</i>

35
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:08,891
<i>She was just looking
for a bottle of scotch...</i>

36
00:02:13,465 --> 00:02:16,479
<i>But found the truth instead.</i>

37
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:24,500
<i>Soon everyone
in town would be asking,</i>

38
00:02:24,667 --> 00:02:27,230
<i>"How could such a monster
come to be?"</i>

39
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,919
<i>Sadly, the answer...</i>

40
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:36,302
<i>Would satisfy no one.</i>

43
00:02:48,589 --> 00:02:50,776
<i>I met Eddie on a Monday.</i>

44
00:02:53,988 --> 00:02:55,925
<i>He had just turned 4.</i>

45
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:01,911
If you're smart,
you'll take up jogging now.

46
00:03:02,078 --> 00:03:04,142
Don't wait till you're my age.
It's too late.

47
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:07,587
- <i>I can't do anything!</i>
- <i>At this point I'd settle for anything.</i>

48
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:10,223
<i>Do the dishes. Wipe down the counter.
You've given up!</i>

49
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,734
- <i>I'm doing the best I can.</i>
- What's going on in there?

50
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,618
<i>You know what?
I don't need this crap. I am done!</i>

51
00:03:15,785 --> 00:03:17,319
Baby, I said I was sorry!

52
00:03:17,486 --> 00:03:20,033
- Too late. I can't take it anymore.
- But you can't walk out.

53
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:22,557
- We have a kid!
- No, you have a kid.

54
00:03:22,724 --> 00:03:25,246
I never wanted him.
I never wanted any of this!

55
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:26,998
Excuse me!

56
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:30,919
- Is this your child?
- What's it to you?

57
00:03:31,169 --> 00:03:34,919
I'm sure you don't want to be
talking like this in front of him.

58
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:42,597
- I was just leaving.
- Hank, don't do this!

59
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:44,557
Don't leave me here.

60
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,557
I don't want to be alone.

61
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:00,532
Eddie, come here.

62
00:04:01,392 --> 00:04:03,942
Come here,
I have to get ready for work.

63
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,168
It's you.

64
00:04:13,788 --> 00:04:16,058
I just wanted to check in,

65
00:04:16,225 --> 00:04:18,075
see how you guys are doing.

66
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:21,469
Also, I made you a little something.

67
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,056
You're kidding.

68
00:04:23,223 --> 00:04:26,224
It's nothing special,
just macaroni and cheese.

69
00:04:29,359 --> 00:04:31,396
Come on. Let me heat
this up for you.

70
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:36,188
- I don't know.
- And then we can talk.

71
00:04:36,355 --> 00:04:39,247
And if you want to complain
about your husband, I promise,

72
00:04:39,414 --> 00:04:40,822
I won't defend him.

73
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,520
Don't just stand there, then.

74
00:04:45,229 --> 00:04:46,279
Come on in.

75
00:04:52,844 --> 00:04:54,636
He's a handsome little boy.

76
00:04:54,803 --> 00:04:56,753
Looks just like his father...

77
00:04:57,351 --> 00:04:58,548
which is a shame.

78
00:05:01,029 --> 00:05:02,552
Maybe Hank will reconsider.

79
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:05,419
He's serious this time.

80
00:05:06,397 --> 00:05:08,600
I'm all alone
with a 4-year-old to raise.

81
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:11,406
Isn't there anybody
who can help you?

82
00:05:11,573 --> 00:05:13,988
- Family, your mother?
- My mother.

83
00:05:14,645 --> 00:05:15,690
God forbid.

84
00:05:16,325 --> 00:05:17,735
What about friends?

85
00:05:17,902 --> 00:05:21,008
I have a great group of friends
over on Wisteria lane.

86
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:24,120
We've helped each other
get through all sorts of problems.

87
00:05:25,072 --> 00:05:28,548
I've never really been the
type of woman to have girlfriends.

88
00:05:28,715 --> 00:05:29,715
And now

89
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:32,112
I'm 35 years old with a kid.

90
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,668
I'm guessing I'm not really going
to be having any boyfriends either.

91
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:39,796
Don't be ridiculous.
Women in your situation find love.

92
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:41,424
You just have to look for it.

93
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,136
- I guess.
- Well, I've gotta go.

94
00:05:48,397 --> 00:05:50,308
If you like,
I can stop by next week.

95
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,753
You don't have to do that.
We'll be fine.

96
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,521
Eddie, say good-bye to Mary Alice.

97
00:05:56,575 --> 00:05:58,885
- Good-bye.
- You take care, Eddie.

98
00:05:59,832 --> 00:06:00,832
So cute.

99
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:04,458
He's gonna be
a heartbreaker one day.

100
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,526
Just like his father.

101
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:22,861
Hi, Eddie.

102
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:24,735
Remember me?

103
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,913
I brought you a little something.

104
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,765
I'm not supposed to open the door.

105
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,768
Tell your mom I'm here,
and she can open it.

106
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:35,728
She's not here.

107
00:06:36,889 --> 00:06:38,564
Well, tell your babysitter then.

108
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,070
You do have a sitter, don't you?

109
00:06:47,294 --> 00:06:49,594
Eddie, where exactly is your mother?

110
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,222
Oh, my gosh!
What are you doing here?

111
00:07:02,937 --> 00:07:05,675
Look, it's my friend, Mary Alice.

112
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:07,510
Nice to meet you, Mary.

113
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:10,138
The name's Ron.
Can I buy you a drink?

114
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,308
Thanks, but I'm not gonna be here
that long. Get up. You're leaving.

115
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,854
She can't leave yet.
This party's just getting started.

116
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:20,523
Did you say your name was Ron?

117
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:23,318
Shut up, Ron.
I have Eddie in my car.

118
00:07:24,494 --> 00:07:26,821
Has something happened?
He's not hurt, is he?

119
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:29,407
- He's fine, no thanks to you.
- Who's Eddie?

120
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:32,639
Her 4-year-old child
who she left at her home, unattended.

121
00:07:32,806 --> 00:07:34,006
You got a kid?

122
00:07:34,349 --> 00:07:36,432
You might wanna lead
with that next time,

123
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:38,999
before I spring for
the screwdrivers.

124
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,546
Don't you wanna get my phone number?

125
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,424
Look at what you've done.

126
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:48,977
I am this close
to calling social services.

127
00:07:49,144 --> 00:07:51,000
You might wanna change your tone.

128
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:54,117
Let's go.
You've got a little boy to look after.

129
00:07:57,658 --> 00:07:59,625
I know I should have stayed home.

130
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:02,096
But I was already dressed
when the sitter canceled,

131
00:08:02,263 --> 00:08:04,776
and I really just needed
a couple of hours to myself.

132
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,611
He's 4 years old, Barbara.

133
00:08:07,268 --> 00:08:09,676
What if he had gotten sick?
What if he had hurt himself?

134
00:08:09,843 --> 00:08:11,824
I know.
It was really stupid.

135
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,031
You've got to promise me
you will never

136
00:08:14,198 --> 00:08:16,936
- do something like this again.
- Never again.

137
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,103
I swear.

138
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,139
It's just...

139
00:08:23,359 --> 00:08:24,359
What?

140
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,592
I really need a man.

141
00:08:33,967 --> 00:08:36,018
My heavens. I should
have been home hours ago.

142
00:08:36,185 --> 00:08:38,559
Don't worry about us.
We are good now.

143
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:46,315
I want you to be happy,
Barbara. I do.

144
00:08:47,433 --> 00:08:48,569
It's just...

145
00:08:49,748 --> 00:08:51,161
Being a mother means

146
00:08:51,328 --> 00:08:53,533
always putting his needs
ahead of yours.

147
00:08:55,549 --> 00:08:56,699
You're right.

148
00:08:56,866 --> 00:08:58,816
That's exactly what it means.

149
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:08,008
Come here.

150
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,137
It's not your fault
you ruined my life.

151
00:09:22,535 --> 00:09:25,189
<i>Gabrielle met Eddie on a Tuesday,</i>

152
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,859
<i>The day she moved
into the neighborhood.</i>

153
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:30,335
Carlos, I'm bored.

154
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:34,476
I can't go get my nails done, because
I'm waiting for the freaking movers!

155
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:37,181
Besides, I doubt this town
even has a SPA.

156
00:09:37,348 --> 00:09:40,578
It does, have annoying people who come
to your house with welcome baskets

157
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:43,395
and say things like,
"Hot enough for you?"

158
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,567
No! You are not
going into another meeting!

159
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:49,954
Just because I moved here
for your job, doesn't mean you...

160
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:53,266
Damn right we're
gonna talk about this tonight,

161
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,633
and it will be hot enough for you.

162
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:04,040
Looks like it's just
you and me, Chanel.

163
00:10:22,384 --> 00:10:23,934
Who the hell are you?

164
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:27,246
- How did you get in here?
- Through the window.

165
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:30,379
- How did you get in?
- With my key. I own this place.

166
00:10:30,629 --> 00:10:34,175
I've been playing here since the other
people moved. Can I still do that?

167
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:36,928
Get out. Go home.

168
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,476
Did you know
you're really beautiful?

169
00:10:51,521 --> 00:10:53,916
Okay,
maybe I was a little rude earlier.

170
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:56,322
- What's your story? What do you do?
- I'm a kid.

171
00:10:57,594 --> 00:10:59,951
- Right. So why aren't you in school?
- It's summer.

172
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,870
Right. Well,
I don't really do the kid thing.

173
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:05,331
So, where do you live?

174
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,331
A couple of streets over.

175
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:09,085
The house with the weeds.

176
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:16,107
That's the moving van that
has a lot of boxes I have to unpack.

177
00:11:16,274 --> 00:11:17,974
You better hit the road.

178
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,847
Or I could stay here
and help you unpack.

179
00:11:26,578 --> 00:11:27,645
Follow me.

180
00:11:32,063 --> 00:11:33,359
You missed a spot.

181
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:36,362
- Sorry.
- Don't apologize.

182
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,032
You do good work. Maybe next time
you'll be ready to do a French tip.

183
00:11:40,444 --> 00:11:41,844
Should I get that?

184
00:11:43,685 --> 00:11:46,261
Keep your voice down.
It might be one of those Stepford wives

185
00:11:46,428 --> 00:11:48,564
with another "Welcome to
the neighborhood" cake.

186
00:11:48,731 --> 00:11:50,501
Does it look like I eat cake?

187
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:52,685
Some of the neighbors are nice.

188
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:55,589
That lady with the red hair
makes her own Halloween candy.

189
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,052
The one whose parents
named her after cheese?

190
00:11:58,219 --> 00:12:01,191
No, thank you. I like my robots
a little more lifelike.

191
00:12:02,326 --> 00:12:05,599
Though she's not as bad as that blonde
chick who's always yelling at her kids.

192
00:12:05,849 --> 00:12:08,311
There are people on fire
who are not as loud as she is.

193
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,647
And then I thought,
maybe for a second,

194
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:14,547
that Susan Mayer lady and I
could friends.

195
00:12:14,714 --> 00:12:16,664
And then she started talking.

196
00:12:18,713 --> 00:12:20,323
Good. I think they're gone.

197
00:12:21,765 --> 00:12:23,615
Can we watch our shows now?

198
00:12:23,782 --> 00:12:26,477
Just as soon as you finish unpacking
those boxes in the kitchen.

199
00:12:26,644 --> 00:12:28,244
I did it this morning.

200
00:12:30,211 --> 00:12:32,404
If you can sew, I am locking you
in my basement,

201
00:12:32,571 --> 00:12:35,296
- and you are staying here forever.
- Cool!

202
00:12:35,697 --> 00:12:37,078
Eddie, I was kidding.

203
00:12:37,245 --> 00:12:39,592
You've been coming here
every day for a week.

204
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,509
Doesn't your mother mind?

205
00:12:41,676 --> 00:12:44,126
Are you sure?
Maybe I should call her.

206
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:47,975
She has this new boyfriend,
and they like their alone time.

207
00:12:51,272 --> 00:12:53,606
Then why don't you
stay for dinner? I'll cook.

208
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:56,181
- Great!
- Although, you are the one who

209
00:12:56,348 --> 00:12:59,049
unpacked the pots and pans, so,
I'd hate to mess up your system.

210
00:12:59,216 --> 00:13:01,266
I'll cook.
I can heat up soup.

211
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:04,200
More than I can do.

212
00:13:08,082 --> 00:13:11,141
Yao Lin, how sick are you, really?
If you can dial a phone,

213
00:13:11,308 --> 00:13:14,210
you can come in and do three loads
of laundry and wash some dishes.

214
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:20,728
You know I can't understand when
you speak in your native gibberish!

215
00:13:26,232 --> 00:13:27,306
Surprise, babe.

216
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:30,101
What are you doing home?

217
00:13:30,597 --> 00:13:33,897
I was at work and I started
thinking about my lonely...

218
00:13:34,502 --> 00:13:35,752
beautiful wife.

219
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,985
And that big beautiful bathtub
upstairs we haven't christened yet.

220
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:41,714
You pig.

221
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:46,053
So you're saying you don't
wanna take a bath with me?

222
00:13:47,128 --> 00:13:51,077
I guess the pans can wait until Yao Lin
recovers from her double pneumonia.

223
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,958
All right.
We've done the tub.

224
00:13:58,262 --> 00:14:01,132
Maybe we should christen
the guest room next.

225
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,314
That sounds great,
but I need to get going.

226
00:14:03,481 --> 00:14:06,262
Wait a minute. You're going back
to work? This is a nooner?

227
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,858
I can't take the whole day off.
I already canceled

228
00:14:09,025 --> 00:14:11,934
- two meetings and a lunch for this.
- So how long do we have?

229
00:14:12,343 --> 00:14:13,436
Five more minutes.

230
00:14:14,394 --> 00:14:16,772
Don't just sit there.
Fondle something.

231
00:14:18,522 --> 00:14:20,734
What the hell? Who are you?

232
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:25,698
- You know this kid?
- He lives in the neighborhood.

233
00:14:26,184 --> 00:14:28,951
I knocked. No one answered.
So I came through the window.

234
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,245
We're naked. Get out!

235
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:33,581
She told me I could come over.
Who's this guy?

236
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:36,709
He's my husband, Eddie! Get out!

237
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,409
This is how you've been
spending your days?

238
00:14:43,426 --> 00:14:46,776
- He's lonely. I'm lonely.
- There are women on this street

239
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:49,096
- you can be friends with.
- They're all so weird.

240
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:52,600
Your best friend is a 9-year-old boy.
That's weird.

241
00:14:53,051 --> 00:14:56,503
He has no one in his life.
His mother totally ignores him.

242
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,181
I'm thinking of going over
there and saying something.

243
00:14:59,348 --> 00:15:00,704
Stay out of it.

244
00:15:00,871 --> 00:15:04,278
This is where we live now, I don't want
us to be known as the nosy neighbors.

245
00:15:09,518 --> 00:15:11,577
- But he's so sad.
- I don't care.

246
00:15:12,134 --> 00:15:14,460
Stop using him as your excuse.
Cut him loose

247
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:17,875
and get out there and
start making a life for yourself.

248
00:15:27,149 --> 00:15:28,149
Buddy?

249
00:15:32,889 --> 00:15:35,893
Edie, I'm sorry
Carlos yelled at you.

250
00:15:36,821 --> 00:15:38,854
It's just...
we were cleaning the tub.

251
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:42,129
I know what sex is.
I'm not stupid.

252
00:15:43,649 --> 00:15:45,086
No, you're not,

253
00:15:45,414 --> 00:15:48,489
which is why you should know you can't
just break into people's houses.

254
00:15:49,007 --> 00:15:51,033
It was okay when I was
unpacking your boxes.

255
00:15:52,371 --> 00:15:54,421
Look, Eddie, I really like you.

256
00:15:55,314 --> 00:15:56,664
But the thing is,

257
00:15:57,815 --> 00:16:00,015
we can't hang out so much anymore.

258
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,171
I need to make friends my age,
and you need to make friends your age.

259
00:16:05,718 --> 00:16:08,068
You know what?
You're not so pretty.

260
00:16:57,001 --> 00:16:59,810
<i>Bree hired Eddie to
help out on a Wednesday,</i>

261
00:17:01,014 --> 00:17:03,228
<i>and she helped him in return.</i>

262
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:06,195
It's looking wonderful, Eddie.

263
00:17:07,042 --> 00:17:08,585
Same time tomorrow?

264
00:17:09,048 --> 00:17:10,398
Sure, Mrs. Hodge.

265
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:16,493
I think you gave me too much.

266
00:17:16,743 --> 00:17:18,871
Call it a bonus for a job well done.

267
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:21,050
You don't need to do this.

268
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,398
I'm sure you could
use a little extra cash.

269
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:26,295
Do you have a girlfriend? Mayber
you could buy her something nice.

270
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,093
I don't have a girlfriend.

271
00:17:32,991 --> 00:17:34,441
You're still young.

272
00:17:35,449 --> 00:17:37,167
It wouldn't matter how old I am.

273
00:17:37,334 --> 00:17:38,934
Girls never notice me.

274
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:43,937
Did it ever occur to you that they might
be waiting for you to notice them?

275
00:17:50,412 --> 00:17:52,071
Are there any girls that you like?

276
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:55,574
There is this one girl at school.

277
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,242
Do you ever talk to her?

278
00:17:59,494 --> 00:18:01,630
See? She has probably
noticed you lots of times

279
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:04,208
and wonders why you don't
walk up to introduce yourself.

280
00:18:04,554 --> 00:18:06,126
I wouldn't even know what to say.

281
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:10,923
- Does she have nice eyes?
- She has nice everything.

282
00:18:12,362 --> 00:18:14,596
You can start
by mentioning her eyes.

283
00:18:14,763 --> 00:18:17,554
Trust me. You can never go wrong
with a genuine compliment.

284
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,042
This is good stuff.
Anything else?

285
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:24,103
Once you have her attention,
you've gotta woo her.

286
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:27,272
- Woo?
- Yes. Give her a little gift

287
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:29,531
so she knows that you're
thinking about her.

288
00:18:29,698 --> 00:18:31,188
Flowers are nice.

289
00:18:31,355 --> 00:18:32,955
Roses are even better.

290
00:18:33,561 --> 00:18:35,061
And then eventually,

291
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:37,449
you can work your way up to jewelry.

292
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:40,077
I can't afford all that.

293
00:18:43,123 --> 00:18:44,123
Now you can.

294
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:55,764
Excuse me.

295
00:18:56,096 --> 00:18:57,928
Are you Eddie Orlofsky's mother?

296
00:18:58,494 --> 00:19:00,431
- Who's asking?
- Bree Hodge.

297
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:03,934
Your son has been doing some painting
for me over on Wisteria Lane.

298
00:19:05,229 --> 00:19:07,771
You're not the woman who has sex
with her gardeners, are you?

299
00:19:08,601 --> 00:19:10,451
Good heavens, no. That's...

300
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:12,608
somebody else.

301
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:15,796
May I please speak to Eddie?

302
00:19:15,963 --> 00:19:17,239
He's not here.

303
00:19:19,508 --> 00:19:21,506
Then maybe you can help me.

304
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:27,499
A few weeks ago, I gave Eddie some
advice on how to talk to girls.

305
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:30,711
I'm glad someone did.
The kid is a lummox.

306
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:36,651
What I didn't realize is that

307
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:39,553
the object of his affection
is my daughter Danielle.

308
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,757
He gave her roses and then
more roses, and then I found

309
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:46,101
this in my mailbox.

310
00:19:49,199 --> 00:19:50,299
Big spender.

311
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,192
Just like his dad.

312
00:19:53,957 --> 00:19:55,486
It was a lovely gesture.

313
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:03,104
Sadly, Danielle doesn't return his
feelings. She spends most of her time

314
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:06,205
- with the other cheerleaders...
- Say no more. She's out of his league.

315
00:20:08,176 --> 00:20:11,476
- That's not what I mean.
- You want me to talk to him?

316
00:20:13,211 --> 00:20:16,339
Yes. If you could
just say something to

317
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,756
- let him down easy.
- You got it.

318
00:20:22,053 --> 00:20:23,347
What's going on?

319
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:26,581
This lady says
you've been stalking her daughter.

320
00:20:27,178 --> 00:20:30,343
- I didn't say that.
- You said he is harassing some girl

321
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:33,899
he has no chance with.
What the hell else do you call that?

322
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:35,849
I was trying to woo her.

323
00:20:41,042 --> 00:20:42,074
Woo her?

324
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,368
My God. That's hysterical.

325
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,370
There's no need to mock him.

326
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,539
Who is mocking? I am thrilled.

327
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,453
I always figured the only girl
he'd end up with would be

328
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,460
blind, deaf or inflatable.

329
00:20:55,274 --> 00:20:58,734
But now that I know
how good he is at wooing...

330
00:21:00,451 --> 00:21:02,201
Please don't laugh at me.

331
00:21:02,689 --> 00:21:04,494
I'll do what I want, Romeo.

332
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:05,783
And don't worry.

333
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,934
I'll make sure he stops
hassling your daughter.

334
00:21:18,891 --> 00:21:19,903
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:32,746 --> 00:21:34,761
It's been a few days.
I wasn't...

336
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:37,028
sure if I'd be seeing you again.

337
00:21:38,116 --> 00:21:40,257
I didn't wanna come back,
but I needed the money.

338
00:21:41,641 --> 00:21:43,802
No, I don't blame you
for being angry.

339
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,055
I don't wanna talk about this.

340
00:21:47,941 --> 00:21:51,359
I wish you had told me that Danielle
was the girl you were interested in.

341
00:21:52,003 --> 00:21:54,649
Right, then you could have told me
that she was out of my league

342
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,288
- and saved my mom the trouble.
- I wouldn't have said that,

343
00:21:57,455 --> 00:21:59,488
and I definitely
wouldn't have laughed at you.

344
00:21:59,655 --> 00:22:00,655
Why not?

345
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:02,656
It's pretty funny.

346
00:22:03,395 --> 00:22:06,158
Nerdy freak wants to date
popular cheerleader?

347
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,654
The only thing I see
when I look at you

348
00:22:08,821 --> 00:22:11,496
is a nice young man, who isn't treated
as well as he should be.

349
00:22:13,552 --> 00:22:15,209
Tell Danielle she can relax.

350
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:18,093
I won't be talking to her
anymore. I've been forbidden.

351
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,840
Danielle would be happy
to talk to you, as a friend.

352
00:22:22,263 --> 00:22:25,263
I don't want a friend.
I want someone to love me.

353
00:22:29,993 --> 00:22:31,643
Well, of course you do.

354
00:22:34,106 --> 00:22:35,407
I think I...

355
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:37,648
I wanna work now.

356
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:49,471
There is someone out there for you.

357
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:51,370
You just have to be patient.

358
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,370
For how long?

359
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:57,459
I feel like I'm waiting for someone
who's never gonna show up.

360
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:02,600
There are girls out there
who will say "yes" to you.

361
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:04,341
You just have to find them.

362
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:09,833
Yes.

363
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,200
It's half up front and half after.

364
00:23:15,448 --> 00:23:16,728
So where do we go?

365
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,770
Down there.

366
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:22,651
Don't worry, cutie.

367
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,670
No one's gonna see us.

368
00:23:25,216 --> 00:23:27,166
You can do whatever you want.

369
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,210
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

370
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:38,231
I forgot something.

371
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:40,710
I got you these.

372
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,349
Please don't laugh at me.

373
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,600
I'm sorry.

374
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:57,767
I'm sorry.

375
00:24:00,151 --> 00:24:01,351
Let's just go.

376
00:24:28,421 --> 00:24:30,552
<i>Susan first noticed Eddie</i>

377
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,430
<i>as the boy who sold her coffee.</i>

378
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,798
<i>Then one Thursday,</i>

379
00:24:35,965 --> 00:24:37,893
<i>she noticed something more.</i>

380
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,561
That's amazing.

381
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,933
- I didn't know you were an artist.
- I was just... I'm fooling around.

382
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,750
- What can I get you?
- No, let me see it.

383
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:58,004
Look at the shadowing
and the blending.

384
00:24:58,171 --> 00:24:59,247
It's really good.

385
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,095
My mom thinks I'm wasting my time.

386
00:25:01,262 --> 00:25:03,526
She says there's lots of people
way better than me.

387
00:25:04,345 --> 00:25:08,145
You tell your mom that I have
an expensive, worthless art degree

388
00:25:08,312 --> 00:25:11,134
that says I know what I'm taking about,
and you have huge potential.

389
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:13,303
You think?

390
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,984
You just need to work
on your technique.

391
00:25:16,151 --> 00:25:17,901
I could help if you want.

392
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:19,383
Seriously?

393
00:25:20,757 --> 00:25:22,457
That'd be great. Thanks.

394
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,149
Okay, whatever you want...
on the house.

395
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:30,946
I'll have a large,
triple-shot latte.

396
00:25:32,489 --> 00:25:34,887
That's funny. Your husband
was in here earlier,

397
00:25:35,054 --> 00:25:37,821
- and that's exactly what he ordered.
- Actually, he's...

398
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:39,579
now my ex-husband.

399
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:46,712
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.
- No. It's fine. We've all moved on.

400
00:25:47,853 --> 00:25:51,803
Mike's dating the woman that lives
across the street now, and I'm...

401
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,749
adding a double chocolate
brownie to my order.

402
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,700
We're all very happy.

403
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,593
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

404
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,048
I'm sure a lot of people
would like to date you.

405
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:06,165
You have huge potential, too.

406
00:26:08,197 --> 00:26:09,197
Brownie.

407
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:11,458
Right.

408
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,869
Eddie, the detail is amazing.
Your use of perspective....

409
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,140
I can't believe you've come
so far in just a few weeks.

410
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,240
Well...

411
00:26:24,658 --> 00:26:26,084
I had a really good teacher.

412
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:27,939
That's sweet.

413
00:26:28,415 --> 00:26:31,769
But actually, I think
that you've outgrown me,

414
00:26:31,936 --> 00:26:34,484
which is why
I have a surprise for you.

415
00:26:34,651 --> 00:26:35,651
What?

416
00:26:36,716 --> 00:26:40,692
I signed you up for a 2-week seminar
at the Art Institute.

417
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,438
Before you say you can't afford it,
I already wrote the check.

418
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,775
This is, like, the nicest thing
anybody's ever done for me.

419
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,364
- But I can't go.
- Why not?

420
00:26:56,851 --> 00:26:59,430
My mom would never let me.
I mean, she thinks

421
00:26:59,597 --> 00:27:02,537
- this whole art thing is stupid.
- You can't let her do this to you.

422
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:04,660
You have such a gift.

423
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,490
Listen to me.

424
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:17,636
When you love something that much,
you can't just let it go.

425
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:21,760
That kind of love is the one thing
that keeps us going,

426
00:27:22,363 --> 00:27:25,101
whether it makes sense
to anyone else or not.

427
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,859
This is just about the only thing
that makes me happy.

428
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,420
Then to hell
with the rest of the world.

429
00:27:47,888 --> 00:27:49,888
Are you there? It's me, Eddie.

430
00:27:50,469 --> 00:27:52,519
Come on in! I'll be right down.

431
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,739
Hey, those art classes were amazing!

432
00:27:57,084 --> 00:28:01,088
The first three days, they had us do
nothing but portraits from memory.

433
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:04,980
And then they brought us down
to the beach to do seascapes.

434
00:28:05,147 --> 00:28:07,097
I've got so much to tell you!

435
00:28:07,661 --> 00:28:08,661
Me, too.

436
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,292
Why are you wearing that?

437
00:28:13,948 --> 00:28:15,448
I'm getting married.

438
00:28:16,584 --> 00:28:18,238
- To who?
- Mike.

439
00:28:18,794 --> 00:28:20,853
But he divorced you.

440
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,180
- He made you so unhappy.
- He did.

441
00:28:25,231 --> 00:28:28,707
But then this madman kidnapped MJ,
and so I went after him,

442
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,909
and then Mike came after us,
and he saved us both.

443
00:28:32,076 --> 00:28:34,021
So we fell back in love.

444
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:38,383
This doesn't make any sense.
It's so quick.

445
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,633
I know.

446
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:42,981
Are those éclairs?

447
00:28:44,234 --> 00:28:46,308
They look messy. Get them away.

448
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,727
So, yeah, it is quick.

449
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,860
I can't believe in

450
00:28:51,177 --> 00:28:53,440
two hours,
I'm gonna be marrying Mike.

451
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,490
And promising him
I'll be with him forever...

452
00:28:56,855 --> 00:28:59,654
for the second time.
I have zero credibility.

453
00:29:01,584 --> 00:29:02,616
Look at me.

454
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:05,809
I don't know
if I'm gonna make it down the aisle.

455
00:29:05,976 --> 00:29:08,513
Are they chocolate?
No, I don't wanna know.

456
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,458
- Don't do it.
- They just smell so good.

457
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,044
I mean the wedding.
If you're not sure, don't marry Mike.

458
00:29:16,394 --> 00:29:18,235
I booked the church,
I bought the dress.

459
00:29:18,402 --> 00:29:20,152
I have to marry somebody.

460
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,300
You could marry me.

461
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:27,599
I have some money saved up.

462
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,777
Okay, you almost got me.

463
00:29:42,196 --> 00:29:43,735
You are so sweet.

464
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,911
You saw that I was freaking out and
you knew that I needed a good laugh.

465
00:29:48,758 --> 00:29:50,911
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

466
00:29:51,078 --> 00:29:53,750
I have to finish getting ready.
Come to the church if you want.

467
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:57,069
What the hell?

468
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,882
I can always use my bouquet
to cover the stain.

469
00:30:19,204 --> 00:30:21,194
By the power vested in me,

470
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:24,572
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

471
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,780
You may kiss your bride.

472
00:31:50,986 --> 00:31:53,495
I was just getting some coffee.
How sweet of you to visit.

473
00:31:54,578 --> 00:31:57,165
Well, it's the first day that
they allowed non-family members.

474
00:32:02,458 --> 00:32:04,130
I still can't believe it happened.

475
00:32:05,254 --> 00:32:07,258
I keep asking myself,
how can there be

476
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,558
this kind of evil in the world?

477
00:32:14,128 --> 00:32:16,184
What kind of monster
would do this to her?

478
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,108
It wasn't a monster.

479
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,930
No, monsters are big and strong.

480
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:32,040
This was done by some
weak, insignificant

481
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:34,786
piece of garbage that doesn't even
deserve to be on this earth.

482
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:41,160
Anyone who could do this to someone
as sweet as Julie and you...

483
00:32:42,059 --> 00:32:45,350
He should just
do everyone a favor and just...

484
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,730
kill himself.

485
00:32:50,048 --> 00:32:51,948
Anyone that could do this...

486
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:54,556
is too cowardly for that.

487
00:33:01,648 --> 00:33:02,798
You're right.

488
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,827
<i>It was during a Friday
night game of charades</i>

489
00:33:09,994 --> 00:33:13,449
<i>that Lynette was clued in
to the truth of Eddie's life.</i>

490
00:33:13,699 --> 00:33:16,244
Three words.
Third word. Third word.

491
00:33:18,124 --> 00:33:19,124
You. You.

492
00:33:19,503 --> 00:33:20,915
Pregnant. Bloated.

493
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,375
Swollen. Huge.

494
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,795
- Lady, Tom. I'm a lady.
- No talking.

495
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,545
Better than hitting.

496
00:33:29,131 --> 00:33:30,383
<i>Du Barry was a lady.</i>

497
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,343
<i>Three times a lady.</i>

498
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,304
- <i>Tramp and the Lady</i>?
- No. <i>My Fair Lady</i>!

499
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,844
Yes. Yes!

500
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,516
<i>Tramp and the lady</i>. Really?

501
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:42,264
Coming!
It's not easy

502
00:33:42,431 --> 00:33:45,234
when you're swollen,
bloated and huge.

503
00:33:47,122 --> 00:33:48,192
Where's my kid?

504
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:51,112
Hey, Barbara. He's in here with us.
You want to come in?

505
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:52,770
No.

506
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:57,398
Get out here.

507
00:34:03,299 --> 00:34:05,953
- What are you doing here?
- Why didn't you answer your phone?

508
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,636
That was probably our fault.

509
00:34:07,803 --> 00:34:10,443
We were playing charades,
and you know how loud that can get.

510
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:12,592
I guess my invitation
got lost in the mail.

511
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,380
- You gotta come home.
- It's not even 8:00, mom.

512
00:34:16,547 --> 00:34:18,181
- I don't care.
- I'm having fun.

513
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,933
You should have thought about that
before you hid my stuff.

514
00:34:21,183 --> 00:34:23,220
- I didn't hide it.
- Everything okay?

515
00:34:23,387 --> 00:34:25,501
- It's nothing.
- Yeah, he hides my booze.

516
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:27,982
And then acts all ashamed
when I call him on it.

517
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:30,860
I know you hid it,
you little bastard.

518
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,904
Mrs. Scavo, it's okay. It's okay.

519
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:35,304
Mom, come on. I'll walk you home.

520
00:34:38,986 --> 00:34:41,412
I don't think you should talk
to your son that way.

521
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:46,751
What do you care? Huh?
What is he, your pet project?

522
00:34:47,646 --> 00:34:50,025
You feed him a little dinner,
Lynette, and then you

523
00:34:50,192 --> 00:34:53,800
let him play your stupid games
so you can feel good about yourself?

524
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,221
I got your number.

525
00:35:22,396 --> 00:35:23,796
I'm out of scotch.

526
00:35:25,163 --> 00:35:27,563
I'll buy you some more
while I'm out.

527
00:35:27,974 --> 00:35:29,252
Got any in your room?

528
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,440
No. And stay out of there.

529
00:35:38,143 --> 00:35:40,743
Hi, Mrs. Scavo.
I'm here to fix your car.

530
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:44,309
You are so sweet
to remember this. Thank you.

531
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:47,145
So...
how are things at home?

532
00:35:48,595 --> 00:35:51,190
Are the tools in the garage?
I should probably get started.

533
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,499
- We got any cake left?
- I'm not sure.

534
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,370
You okay?

535
00:36:11,914 --> 00:36:15,111
I don't know. I keep
thinking about last night.

536
00:36:15,569 --> 00:36:17,049
Yeah, me, too.

537
00:36:17,399 --> 00:36:18,799
And I'm just so...

538
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
livid.

539
00:36:24,795 --> 00:36:27,185
That Barbara
is an infuriating woman.

540
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,637
I am livid at us...

541
00:36:31,025 --> 00:36:33,566
the way she talked to Eddie
and we did nothing.

542
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:37,425
I know. But we can't force her
to be nice to her own kid.

543
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:40,103
That's what everybody always says.

544
00:36:40,565 --> 00:36:42,742
But we all know the woman
is a drunken nightmare.

545
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,848
We complain about her,
we gossip about her,

546
00:36:46,015 --> 00:36:49,055
and then we watch her
walk into that house,

547
00:36:49,756 --> 00:36:52,509
where we know
something bad is happening.

548
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:54,212
But we do nothing.

549
00:36:57,093 --> 00:36:58,093
Well...

550
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,552
I'm tired of being one of the people
who does nothing.

551
00:37:03,415 --> 00:37:07,058
Eddie is an adult now and
he can leave whenever he wants.

552
00:37:07,402 --> 00:37:10,019
He's probably so damaged,
he doesn't know how to leave.

553
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,192
Where are you going with this?

554
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:19,695
Ma, I'm back from the store.

555
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,993
What is that?

556
00:37:26,846 --> 00:37:28,120
Your scrapbook.

557
00:37:31,409 --> 00:37:33,209
I don't understand, Eddie.

558
00:37:33,969 --> 00:37:36,927
There are all these
newspaper articles in here,

559
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:39,280
about girls in Fairview
who've been...

560
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,884
strangled or murdered.

561
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:47,473
Why would you collect this stuff?

562
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:53,533
Don't just look down at your feet.

563
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:56,610
You gotta tell me the truth, okay?

564
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,410
Did you have anything to do with...

565
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:01,863
hurting those girls?

566
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,125
How could you do
something like this? Oh, God.

567
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:17,140
I didn't raise you to...
to be like this.

568
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:21,883
Didn't you?

569
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:27,180
What is that supposed to mean?
This is my fault?

570
00:38:29,514 --> 00:38:30,664
You're upset.

571
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,937
Why don't you sit back down
and have something to drink?

572
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:38,373
You're gonna try
to blame this on me.

573
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,540
No way.

574
00:38:40,298 --> 00:38:41,650
Screw you.

575
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,123
- What are you doing?
- What do you think I'm doing,

576
00:38:47,290 --> 00:38:50,620
- you moron? I'm calling the police!
- Don't do that. Put that down.

577
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,582
I always said the worst mistake I ever
made in my life was having you.

578
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,525
- Perfect timing.
- Mrs. Scavo, what are you doing here?

579
00:39:37,692 --> 00:39:40,711
Are you okay?
Oh, my gosh, you're trembling and...

580
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,006
- I'm just... I was on my way out.
- Then I'll make this quick.

581
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,150
Tom and I have been talking, and...

582
00:39:47,734 --> 00:39:50,513
we would like it
if you would move in with us.

583
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:56,143
I know it's a big change, but
you've gotta get out of here, Eddie.

584
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:58,354
This isn't a healthy situation.

585
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,283
I guess it could be better.

586
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,744
Is she passed out?

587
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:20,371
This is what I'm talking about.
This is why you need to get out of here.

588
00:40:20,538 --> 00:40:22,138
I mean, look at her...

589
00:40:23,259 --> 00:40:24,338
dead drunk.

590
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:30,293
I'll come live with you.

591
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,503
Great. So just pack your bags
and come on over.

592
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,016
I hope you like meat loaf.

593
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:39,770
You want me to come in and help you,
or do you want me to come back later

594
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,643
- to talk to her?
- Believe me, Mrs. Scavo,

595
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,560
she wouldn't hear a word.

596
00:40:55,198 --> 00:40:58,420
<i>There is a house
in the town of Fairview.</i>

597
00:41:00,004 --> 00:41:02,915
<i>Inside this house lives a monster...</i>

598
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:07,377
<i>The kind who kills women.</i>

599
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,307
<i>You may wonder</i>

600
00:41:10,474 --> 00:41:13,387
<i>how a monster like that came to be.</i>

601
00:41:14,736 --> 00:41:16,781
<i>The answer is simple...</i>

602
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,885
<i>Monsters are created...</i>

603
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:23,173
<i>by other monsters.</i>
