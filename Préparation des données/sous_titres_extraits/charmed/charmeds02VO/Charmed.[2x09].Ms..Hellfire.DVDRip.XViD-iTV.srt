1
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:06,487
All right, I can meet
with the Curson Foundation at noon,

2
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:09,607
but then we'll have to move my 1:00
lunch regarding the Lowe estate.

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:11,447
That will affect
my 2:30 slide presentation

4
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:13,560
and my 4:30 meeting
with the new printers.

5
00:00:13,729 --> 00:00:15,082
Have you confirmed
Mrs Swanson yet?

6
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:17,399
- The last Tae Bo class is at 7.
- Okay.

7
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:21,118
I can meet the printers at their office,
walk to the Royal Hotel afterwards,

8
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:22,887
for my 5:30 with Mrs Swanson.

9
00:00:23,049 --> 00:00:24,801
I just have enough time
for kickboxing class.

10
00:00:25,009 --> 00:00:27,603
Wait a minute, Mrs Swanson's
plane is delayed. She'll be in at 6.

11
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:30,966
- Her plane doesn't arrive until 6?
- Well, so much for Tae Bo.

12
00:00:32,409 --> 00:00:35,287
- That's your phone. I will get it for you.
- Thanks, it's probably Jack.

13
00:00:35,449 --> 00:00:37,201
You don't have time for Jack,
literally.

14
00:00:38,249 --> 00:00:39,398
Prue Halliwell's phone.

15
00:00:39,609 --> 00:00:42,601
- This is Mr Caldwell's office.
- It's Mr Caldwell's office.

16
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:46,962
It's the new VP. Monique, why
is Mr Caldwell calling me at home?

17
00:00:47,769 --> 00:00:50,363
What emergency staff meeting?

18
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:53,487
- When this morning?
- Nine-thirty. Be there, or be fired.

19
00:00:54,009 --> 00:00:56,603
- I'm on my way!
- Bye.

20
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:00,121
- I am very tired now. I need a nap.
- Yeah. Well, I need another me.

21
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:02,439
I don't even have time
to have fun anymore.

22
00:01:03,529 --> 00:01:06,089
- Look who it is.
- Morning.

23
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:10,083
- Hi. Do you recognise that person?
- Yeah, she looks vaguely familiar.

24
00:01:10,249 --> 00:01:13,127
Kind of like a sister that we used
to have. What was her name?

25
00:01:14,409 --> 00:01:17,606
- Pipper?
- No. Whatever happened to her?

26
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:20,203
I don't know. She fell in lust
with the next-door neighbour,

27
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:22,166
started spending all of her time there.

28
00:01:22,329 --> 00:01:24,479
That's because she could.
For the first time in months,

29
00:01:24,649 --> 00:01:26,844
her life was nice
and calm and normal.

30
00:01:27,009 --> 00:01:28,442
I don't even care that it's Friday...

31
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,841
Don't even say it.

32
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,797
The 13th. See, I said it,
and nothing happened.

33
00:01:43,929 --> 00:01:47,285
- I told you not to say it!
- So this is my fault?

34
00:01:47,449 --> 00:01:49,007
- Run!
- No!

35
00:01:49,169 --> 00:01:50,841
Get your butt over here right now!

36
00:02:05,929 --> 00:02:09,285
- Like I need this today.
- Since when do demons use bullets?

37
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:11,923
- Maybe it's not a demon.
- Who else would wanna kill us?

38
00:02:12,089 --> 00:02:14,683
Well, you know, you were a little sharp
to the mailman yesterday.

39
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,726
We all know how testy they can be.

40
00:02:19,249 --> 00:02:20,967
- Freeze.
- Kick.

41
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,642
- Send flying.
- Okay.

42
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,201
Oh, my God, she's not a demon.

43
00:04:40,369 --> 00:04:42,280
Multiple aliases.

44
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,001
Foreign currency.

45
00:04:45,209 --> 00:04:47,006
And throwing stars?

46
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:51,844
Not exactly Avon calling.

47
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:55,200
"Sutro Heights Apartments."

48
00:04:55,369 --> 00:04:57,280
That's scary,
she didn't live too far from here.

49
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:58,598
Well, what's even scarier

50
00:04:58,769 --> 00:05:00,805
is we've never been attacked
by a mortal before.

51
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,806
Yeah,
I never killed a mortal before either.

52
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:05,961
- Prue, you had no choice.
- Still doesn't make it any easier.

53
00:05:06,129 --> 00:05:09,405
Does it make it easier
if the mortal was a hit woman?

54
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:13,846
- A list of names, so...
- Yeah, look closer.

55
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:15,965
We're on it, or at least one of us is.

56
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:18,518
P. Halliwell,
and other than an M. Steadwell,

57
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:21,078
we're the only other name
not crossed off.

58
00:05:21,249 --> 00:05:24,161
A hit woman.
Someone obviously hired her.

59
00:05:24,929 --> 00:05:27,841
Someone who knew
that we had powers. I mean, look.

60
00:05:28,049 --> 00:05:32,725
"Prue: Telekinesis. Piper: Power
to freeze. Phoebe: Negligible."

61
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,845
What? Negligible?

62
00:05:36,009 --> 00:05:39,126
Well, that explains why
she drove us to the front door

63
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:40,927
and surprised us from behind.

64
00:05:41,089 --> 00:05:45,241
Still, why would a demon hire a mortal
to kill us? It doesn't make any sense.

65
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:49,163
I just wish we knew about that part
of the equation before we called...

66
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:53,401
Darryl, hi. Thanks for coming.

67
00:05:54,009 --> 00:05:57,126
To tell you the truth,
I'm not sure I actually wanna be here.

68
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,883
Depends on whether or not
you actually tell me the truth this time.

69
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:03,166
- Someone tried to kill us.
- You see who it was?

70
00:06:04,289 --> 00:06:06,723
- She's in there.
- She?

71
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:14,444
We were just sort of
standing here, talking,

72
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:16,406
and suddenly she started
shooting up the place.

73
00:06:16,569 --> 00:06:17,968
A hit woman, we think.

74
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:21,007
Who obviously wanted us dead.
We were on her list.

75
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:23,280
And that's why you're
standing here alive,

76
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:25,121
and she's in here riddled
with bullets?

77
00:06:25,329 --> 00:06:28,241
Darryl, it was self-defence. You can
check her gun if you don't believe us.

78
00:06:28,409 --> 00:06:30,718
The only fingerprints
that you're gonna find on it are hers.

79
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:33,644
Begs the same question.

80
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:37,359
How come she's got the bullets
in her body if you didn't fire the gun?

81
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:43,279
Do you really wanna know, Darryl?

82
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:47,806
Tell me.

83
00:06:51,889 --> 00:06:54,483
We're witches. We...

84
00:06:55,129 --> 00:06:56,482
We have powers.

85
00:06:56,809 --> 00:07:00,085
And we think that there's a...
How do I put this?

86
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:02,248
A demon behind this.

87
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:06,398
The only way for us to find out
who it is is if you can keep all of this

88
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:08,560
quiet for as long as possible.

89
00:07:11,169 --> 00:07:12,807
Let me see the book.

90
00:07:13,649 --> 00:07:15,287
There are nine names
that are crossed out.

91
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:18,361
Besides us, there's only one
other name that's not crossed out.

92
00:07:18,529 --> 00:07:21,919
"Plastique, 10 a.m."
Plastic explosives.

93
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:24,523
For all we know, she's already got
someplace rigged to blow.

94
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:27,960
Maybe it's someplace M. Steadwell's
supposed to be at at 10.

95
00:07:28,129 --> 00:07:30,438
Okay, well, it's after 9 already.

96
00:07:30,609 --> 00:07:32,281
I'll check DMV,
see if I can get an address.

97
00:07:32,449 --> 00:07:33,438
I'm gonna go with you.

98
00:07:33,609 --> 00:07:35,122
Then Prue and I can go
to her apartment

99
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:36,722
and see if we can find
anything there.

100
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:39,084
After we make
a quick pit stop at Buckland's.

101
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,001
- Are you kidding?
- I can't lose my job.

102
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,125
Hey, what do we do with the...?

103
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,797
I can call in a favour
and put the body on ice,

104
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:49,359
but that's not gonna buy you
much time. One day, max.

105
00:07:56,809 --> 00:08:00,006
As the new regional VP
of Buckland's auction houses,

106
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:03,640
I'll be implementing a new course
of action for a new millennium.

107
00:08:04,209 --> 00:08:05,608
The problem is,

108
00:08:05,769 --> 00:08:08,886
I don't know any of you well enough
to know who's worth keeping.

109
00:08:09,129 --> 00:08:10,562
And who's not.

110
00:08:10,729 --> 00:08:14,005
- You're late, partner.
- We are not partners.

111
00:08:14,169 --> 00:08:16,603
- Do you wanna bet?
- You, dark hair.

112
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:20,201
Yeah, the one who tried to sneak
in late. What's your name?

113
00:08:20,649 --> 00:08:25,848
My name? Prue... Prue Halliwell.

114
00:08:27,249 --> 00:08:28,682
Yeah, right.

115
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:31,399
Okay, you'll be partnered
with Sheridan there.

116
00:08:32,009 --> 00:08:35,718
Every employee in this room
and their partner

117
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:38,808
has until tomorrow night
to scour through the obits,

118
00:08:38,969 --> 00:08:44,202
do whatever you have to do
to raise $100,000 of auction material.

119
00:08:44,369 --> 00:08:46,405
- Yes?
- By tomorrow?

120
00:08:46,569 --> 00:08:48,639
If you wanna keep your job.

121
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:51,283
Welcome to the new Buckland's.

122
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:57,680
Whoa, I guess we better
clear the decks, huh?

123
00:08:59,209 --> 00:09:01,006
Prue, we might even have
to work over dinner.

124
00:09:01,209 --> 00:09:03,120
- Dinner, no. L...
- Come on.

125
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:05,240
- We're in this together, aren't we?
- Yeah, but...

126
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:10,082
Prue?

127
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:13,208
Prue?

128
00:09:22,969 --> 00:09:26,439
Prue, have you even heard
a word I've said?

129
00:09:27,969 --> 00:09:30,722
No. I'm feeling a little...

130
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:33,922
...weird.

131
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,328
I'll be...

132
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:40,328
What the hell just happened?

133
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:43,483
I don't know.
I think it was some sort of a...

134
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,204
...astral projection.
- How did you do it?

135
00:09:46,369 --> 00:09:48,929
I just felt this sort of desperate need
for there to be two of me,

136
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:50,317
and all of a sudden, there was.

137
00:09:50,489 --> 00:09:52,525
Do you think this is part
of your powers growing?

138
00:09:52,689 --> 00:09:56,125
Maybe. I mean, if I can move things
with my mind, why not my body?

139
00:09:56,289 --> 00:09:58,757
Well, let's just get out of here
before it happens again.

140
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:05,401
Hey, you know, you can ask me
anything you want about being a witch.

141
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:06,558
No, thanks.

142
00:10:06,729 --> 00:10:09,243
It's really cool. We have this book
called the Book of Shadows.

143
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:10,762
- Too much information.
- But it's...

144
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:13,841
Nothing I wanna know about. I'm
serious. I don't wanna know anything.

145
00:10:14,009 --> 00:10:16,125
Come on, you don't even want
to know if we, like,

146
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,688
can fly or anything like that?

147
00:10:17,849 --> 00:10:20,488
I don't even wanna know if you own
a broom, a skillet, a cauldron,

148
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,287
a DustBuster.
I don't give a damn!

149
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:28,485
Phoebe, I stare down death
every day.

150
00:10:28,649 --> 00:10:30,765
But I'm trained to handle it.
And that's in this world.

151
00:10:30,929 --> 00:10:32,487
I don't know if I wanna be dragged
into another.

152
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,964
You know, I think it's too late, Darryl.

153
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:38,243
But we won't let anything happen
to you, I promise.

154
00:10:39,209 --> 00:10:40,767
Are you sure this is
the right address?

155
00:10:40,929 --> 00:10:43,204
Better hope so. It's the only
M. Steadwell registered.

156
00:10:43,369 --> 00:10:44,597
Damn, it's almost 10:00.

157
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,047
Is that her?

158
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,768
No, don't!

159
00:10:59,969 --> 00:11:01,004
No!

160
00:11:09,249 --> 00:11:12,798
- My God! Everybody okay?
- Yeah.

161
00:11:13,009 --> 00:11:15,204
- Are you okay, Ms Steadwell?
- It worked.

162
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:17,881
I can't believe it.

163
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:21,047
I cast a protection spell,
and it actually worked.

164
00:11:21,209 --> 00:11:23,439
My first spell.

165
00:11:25,169 --> 00:11:26,682
Don't tell me she's a witch too.

166
00:11:43,769 --> 00:11:45,441
Look at this place.

167
00:11:45,849 --> 00:11:50,127
Lalique fixtures, silk-woven rugs. I
could get used to living here in a hurry.

168
00:11:50,289 --> 00:11:53,008
Yeah, you just have to know who
to kill. I'm gonna check the kitchen.

169
00:11:53,169 --> 00:11:54,761
All right. I'll get the bedroom.

170
00:12:05,929 --> 00:12:09,717
Oh, my. Faux. Nice.

171
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:55,238
She must not have lived here long.
All the mail is marked "resident."

172
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:58,162
- Were you twirling?
- No.

173
00:12:58,489 --> 00:13:03,517
But opportunity knocked, and I did
answer. Check out this wardrobe.

174
00:13:03,689 --> 00:13:05,520
- Prue, honey, focus.
- I can't.

175
00:13:05,689 --> 00:13:10,524
It's not just the clothes. Wigs, makeup
kits, prosthetic enhancements.

176
00:13:10,689 --> 00:13:12,805
I wonder if anybody knew
what she really looked like?

177
00:13:12,969 --> 00:13:15,563
- I doubt it.
- And if it weren't for the roses,

178
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:17,248
we wouldn't even know
what to call her.

179
00:13:17,409 --> 00:13:19,047
- What roses?
- They're in the living room,

180
00:13:19,209 --> 00:13:20,642
addressed to Ms Hellfire.

181
00:13:21,169 --> 00:13:22,522
Really?

182
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:31,239
"Until we meet at last. Bane."

183
00:13:32,409 --> 00:13:35,401
Don't move.
Don't even flinch, or you're dead.

184
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,560
That's it. Now slowly turn around.

185
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:41,527
Watch her hands. She can kill you
with them in a second.

186
00:13:41,689 --> 00:13:43,327
Ms Hellfire, I presume.

187
00:13:45,529 --> 00:13:48,202
- You Bane?
- His right-hand man, DJ.

188
00:13:50,009 --> 00:13:53,319
Bane is very unhappy with you.
He'd like to see you now.

189
00:13:56,809 --> 00:14:00,279
Okay, sorry to disappoint you, boys.
Let's go, get out of here, come on.

190
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:03,009
You know, they think I'm Hellfire.

191
00:14:03,329 --> 00:14:05,160
- So?
- So maybe I should go with them.

192
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:08,366
I mean, maybe the best way to find out
who hired her is to pretend to be her.

193
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:11,444
- Okay, that's very funny, let's go.
- Piper, I'm serious.

194
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:14,083
You said yourself that nobody
knows what she looks like.

195
00:14:14,249 --> 00:14:15,523
Certainly not this Bane guy.

196
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:18,044
Well, Prue, somebody might know
what she looks like.

197
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,360
Yeah, but I can protect myself. I mean,
I have something that they don't have,

198
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:24,646
something that guns
can't even compete with.

199
00:14:25,329 --> 00:14:28,048
Today may not be the best day
to boast about your powers.

200
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,882
Okay, look, if this hit woman
was hired by a demon,

201
00:14:31,049 --> 00:14:33,768
then it's only a matter of time
before he finds out that P. Halliwell

202
00:14:33,929 --> 00:14:37,478
is still alive and send someone else.
So we have to do something.

203
00:14:37,689 --> 00:14:41,602
I mean, if you got any better ideas,
I'm certainly game.

204
00:14:41,889 --> 00:14:46,167
- I know, and unfortunately, I don't.
- Okay, so unfreeze them.

205
00:14:46,809 --> 00:14:50,119
Is it just me, or are you
a little too eager to play this role?

206
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,280
- It's not a bad role to play.
- True.

207
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:54,599
- If you wanna get yourself...
- I'll be fine.

208
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:00,447
You gonna make this easy or not?

209
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,804
Put that thing away
before you hurt yourself.

210
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:22,208
I swear to God, Bane.
I tried to get the money for you,

211
00:15:22,729 --> 00:15:24,606
but I messed up. I messed up.

212
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:27,203
I was scared. I didn't know
how you were gonna react.

213
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:28,688
You lied to me.

214
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:31,124
- I didn't know. I didn't know.
- You made a mistake.

215
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:33,320
And you're sorry for it, right?

216
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,879
Right. Yeah.

217
00:15:36,049 --> 00:15:38,927
Well, lesson learned, all right?
Just never lie to me again.

218
00:15:39,089 --> 00:15:41,728
- Understood?
- Thank you.

219
00:15:51,729 --> 00:15:53,720
Well...

220
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:56,245
You are more beautiful
than I imagined.

221
00:15:56,449 --> 00:15:57,962
And we finally meet.

222
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:00,726
Did you like the roses?

223
00:16:01,129 --> 00:16:03,199
I would have preferred orchids.

224
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:06,648
Beautiful and honest.

225
00:16:09,609 --> 00:16:12,726
Let's take a walk.
You know what to bring.

226
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,767
What do I call you?

227
00:16:18,369 --> 00:16:20,280
What you always call me.

228
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:23,128
Ms Hellfire seems so cold in person.

229
00:16:23,329 --> 00:16:27,038
Unless your e-mails to me
have just been a tease.

230
00:16:27,289 --> 00:16:30,167
- I think you know me better than that.
- Do I?

231
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:32,803
You didn't confirm
the Halliwells this morning.

232
00:16:34,609 --> 00:16:36,122
I didn't have a clean shot.

233
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:41,202
Well, that's disappointing.
What about the last one on the list?

234
00:16:41,569 --> 00:16:42,888
Steadwell?

235
00:16:44,609 --> 00:16:46,679
It was a blast.

236
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:51,322
I like your style. I always have.

237
00:16:51,489 --> 00:16:53,445
The problem is, you still got
the Halliwells,

238
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:56,203
but you only got until midnight
to take them out.

239
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:04,443
Don't worry about the Halliwells.
I know their every move.

240
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:06,645
I'm getting a lot of pressure,
you know.

241
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:08,959
- From who?
- You know who.

242
00:17:12,449 --> 00:17:14,087
Of course.

243
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:18,882
Aren't you gonna answer that?

244
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:21,768
Yeah.

245
00:17:22,689 --> 00:17:24,407
- Hello.
- Hey.

246
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:26,958
What happened to you this morning?
You completely disappeared.

247
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:31,088
- I'm with a client.
- Yeah, well, that better be a rich client.

248
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:34,042
- Time is money.
- Champagne?

249
00:17:35,169 --> 00:17:37,285
Champagne, at this hour?
Where are you?

250
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:38,768
- Me?
- To us.

251
00:17:39,609 --> 00:17:41,884
Hey, Prue, you know me,
I'm all for a good time.

252
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,721
But we're under
some serious pressure here.

253
00:17:43,889 --> 00:17:45,083
Yeah, I know...

254
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,480
- Are you there?
- Oh, God.

255
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:52,680
Prue.

256
00:17:56,969 --> 00:17:59,119
You all right? What happened?

257
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:01,041
Prue, what the hell is going on?

258
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:03,960
I'll call you back.

259
00:18:13,129 --> 00:18:14,244
Sorry.

260
00:18:14,609 --> 00:18:16,600
Maybe you better hold off
on this one, huh?

261
00:18:16,769 --> 00:18:18,680
At least until the job is completed.

262
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:23,966
Guess I'd better be going.

263
00:18:24,609 --> 00:18:26,122
You're not going anywhere.

264
00:18:26,849 --> 00:18:28,521
Not without my driving you.

265
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:38,038
- Tell him I'm on it.
- Wait a minute, why me?

266
00:18:38,209 --> 00:18:39,608
I don't even know the guy.

267
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:43,318
You will. Just go to my office.
He'll show, okay?

268
00:18:58,249 --> 00:19:00,046
Looking for me?

269
00:19:01,729 --> 00:19:05,085
- Where in the hell did you come from?
- You really don't wanna know.

270
00:19:05,249 --> 00:19:08,002
Trust me.
Why aren't the witches dead?

271
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:10,637
- Witches?
- Answer me.

272
00:19:11,529 --> 00:19:13,087
How did you know
they weren't dead?

273
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:15,200
One develops a...

274
00:19:16,329 --> 00:19:20,038
...sixth sense about such things
when you've been

275
00:19:20,449 --> 00:19:22,679
in purgatory as long as I have.

276
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:27,000
Never mind. I made a deal.

277
00:19:27,289 --> 00:19:31,965
It gives me a 24-hour window
to break free. But now, you people,

278
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:36,407
you gotta kill those witches
if I'm going to be successful.

279
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:38,758
Who are you?

280
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:40,677
A demon.

281
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:45,007
A demon who has the power.

282
00:19:46,529 --> 00:19:50,807
A power to turn the innermost fears
of a mortal into reality.

283
00:19:51,009 --> 00:19:53,921
And there's nothing you can do
about it.

284
00:19:54,089 --> 00:19:55,317
Want to see?

285
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:01,205
Your greatest fear

286
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:03,877
is that your boss
is being double-crossed.

287
00:20:04,049 --> 00:20:07,837
And when he finds out, he's going
to kill you for not protecting him.

288
00:20:23,369 --> 00:20:25,280
Pretty cool, huh?

289
00:20:31,329 --> 00:20:35,038
I can have my crew install some
temporary windows sometime tonight.

290
00:20:35,209 --> 00:20:36,961
Great, thanks.

291
00:20:38,289 --> 00:20:40,200
You waiting for a call?

292
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:44,088
Yeah. I'm just a little worried
about Prue.

293
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:47,125
I don't blame you
after what happened.

294
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:49,519
What makes you think
it was a drive-by?

295
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:53,158
I don't know, wild guess, I guess.

296
00:20:54,129 --> 00:20:55,721
I want you to move in with me.

297
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,447
At least until
the permanent windows are installed.

298
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:03,248
If it's your sisters you're worried about,
they can move in too.

299
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,608
Since Jenny moved back
with her folks,

300
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:08,203
there's just plenty of room.

301
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:13,439
I don't know if that's such a great idea.
Some of us don't wear pyjamas.

302
00:21:14,329 --> 00:21:16,479
I'm serious.

303
00:21:16,689 --> 00:21:20,807
Because if things worked out,
maybe you could stay.

304
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:26,165
Permanently. If you wanted to.

305
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:30,042
- Piper?
- In here!

306
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:33,080
I don't know what to say.

307
00:21:33,409 --> 00:21:35,001
Say you'll think about it.

308
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:40,046
Is he a wi...?

309
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:47,598
- Who's she?
- Would you believe M. Steadwell?

310
00:21:48,009 --> 00:21:50,364
- How's Dan?
- Just asked me to move in.

311
00:21:50,529 --> 00:21:52,042
- Where's Morris?
- He's at the morgue,

312
00:21:52,249 --> 00:21:54,479
putting the hit woman's body
under Marcie's name.

313
00:21:54,649 --> 00:21:56,241
- Where's Prue?
- Way overdue.

314
00:21:56,409 --> 00:21:58,161
She's assuming
the identity of the hit woman.

315
00:21:58,329 --> 00:21:59,808
- What?
- Yeah, and guess what.

316
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:02,278
She's got a new power.
She can astral project now.

317
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,968
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

318
00:22:04,169 --> 00:22:05,284
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

319
00:22:05,489 --> 00:22:07,002
- I hate her!
- I know.

320
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:09,168
All right, I'm gonna send Dan home.

321
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,360
You keep Marcie in the house
until this is all over.

322
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:13,360
- Yeah, all right. Then we'll talk.
- Yeah.

323
00:22:17,809 --> 00:22:20,403
Well, thanks for the...

324
00:22:22,929 --> 00:22:24,248
...ride.

325
00:22:30,249 --> 00:22:33,082
You say you preferred orchids.

326
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:39,246
- I'm impressed.
- I'm glad.

327
00:22:41,089 --> 00:22:42,886
Now close your eyes.

328
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:46,888
Trust me.

329
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:54,243
Go ahead, open them.

330
00:22:56,129 --> 00:22:58,006
And open this when I leave, okay?

331
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:01,645
But remember,
three Halliwells by midnight.

332
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,041
On second thought, make it by 10.

333
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:06,769
It gives me more time
to take care of it myself,

334
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,488
in case you fail.

335
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:36,448
Wait a minute,
you can't come in here.

336
00:23:36,609 --> 00:23:38,679
Bet you.

337
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:42,804
What do you want?

338
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:47,008
Why, your greatest fear,
of course, which...

339
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:53,204
...is being autopsied yourself.

340
00:24:17,009 --> 00:24:20,797
Doesn't look much
like an explosion victim to me.

341
00:24:21,609 --> 00:24:26,524
I think your fears
of a double-cross are justified.

342
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:41,085
Oh, my stars!

343
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,487
What is it? What's wrong?

344
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:47,085
You can't keep wolfsbane
and holy thistle on the same shelf.

345
00:24:47,249 --> 00:24:49,160
Their harmonics
are in complete opposition.

346
00:24:49,729 --> 00:24:53,438
I mean, I don't wanna second-guess
a sister witch, but this is all wrong.

347
00:24:53,609 --> 00:24:56,248
I don't see how you can cast a spell
that's worth a darn.

348
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:58,843
Now, wait just a minute, missy.

349
00:24:59,849 --> 00:25:03,125
Oh, my God. Prue's home, I think.

350
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,645
That's Prue, all right.

351
00:25:11,129 --> 00:25:14,246
Gee, Prue, looks like being
a hired killer agrees with you.

352
00:25:14,409 --> 00:25:16,877
I didn't wanna run the risk
of anyone seeing me out of uniform.

353
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:18,402
We've been worried sick about you.

354
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:20,764
I'm sorry, I just didn't wanna
jeopardise my cover.

355
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:24,640
- Nice cover.
- And nice Porsche. A gift from Bane?

356
00:25:25,209 --> 00:25:27,518
No, Bane prefers...

357
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:29,998
Never mind.

358
00:25:30,449 --> 00:25:32,599
Look, I need to get back
before they get suspicious.

359
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:35,124
- Tell me what you know.
- We know M. Steadwell is safe.

360
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:38,440
- Can't say the same for the kitchen.
- Any idea why she was on the list?

361
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:41,043
Could be because she's a witch.
I mean, not a magical witch,

362
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:44,599
- but a witch practitioner nonetheless.
- A hyperactive witch practitioner.

363
00:25:44,769 --> 00:25:47,329
I wonder if all the names were witches.
How many were on the list?

364
00:25:47,769 --> 00:25:50,966
Eleven. Except that P. Halliwell
was only down once.

365
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:52,642
So if you count us individually...

366
00:25:53,409 --> 00:25:55,320
...13.
- Thirteen dead witches

367
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:58,487
by midnight on Friday the 13th.
Ring any bells?

368
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:00,725
- Barbas.
- Gotta be.

369
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:02,999
It can't be.
I mean, we eighty-sixed him already.

370
00:26:03,369 --> 00:26:04,961
He must have found
some kind of loophole.

371
00:26:05,129 --> 00:26:07,597
I've gotta get back to Bane,
try and flush Barbas out.

372
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:09,407
Prue, you can't go back there.

373
00:26:09,889 --> 00:26:13,325
Piper, it's almost 8.
I have gotta get to Barbas fast.

374
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:16,561
Otherwise, Bane's gonna wanna
see three bodies, our bodies.

375
00:26:17,049 --> 00:26:18,323
Have fun.

376
00:26:18,569 --> 00:26:21,879
- Phoebe, I'm working.
- More like you're working it.

377
00:26:22,049 --> 00:26:25,758
Come on, Prue, I've taken a walk
on the dark side. I know all the signs.

378
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:27,806
Okay, so it's a little different.

379
00:26:27,969 --> 00:26:29,925
- And dangerous.
- I can handle it.

380
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:33,126
Prue, Barbas can paralyse you
and use your greatest fear against you.

381
00:26:33,289 --> 00:26:34,927
You don't want to face that alone.

382
00:26:35,089 --> 00:26:38,161
How? I already conquered my fear
of drowning. What else can he do?

383
00:26:38,409 --> 00:26:42,118
Well, maybe tap into some other fear.
You can't defeat him alone, Prue.

384
00:26:42,289 --> 00:26:44,598
I know that.
But for now, I'll be okay.

385
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,964
I'll call you guys
and check in in an hour.

386
00:27:21,889 --> 00:27:23,880
You look like you're ready
to celebrate.

387
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:27,041
- Are the Halliwells dead?
- The night's young.

388
00:27:27,329 --> 00:27:29,763
We have a little bit
of business to discuss.

389
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:33,245
- What, all work and no play?
- We'll play...

390
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:38,126
...right after I get my money.
- You'll get paid when they're dead.

391
00:27:39,569 --> 00:27:41,525
You know, the boss has
a nasty little habit

392
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:43,680
of disappearing
in the middle of the night.

393
00:27:44,089 --> 00:27:46,683
I'd hate for my money
to disappear with him.

394
00:27:47,129 --> 00:27:49,165
Can I trust you? And Barbas?

395
00:27:49,329 --> 00:27:51,684
I'm disappointed
you doubt either one of us.

396
00:27:51,849 --> 00:27:53,521
I wanna talk to him.

397
00:27:54,329 --> 00:27:57,287
Well, like you said,
the night is young.

398
00:28:34,569 --> 00:28:37,288
- DJ, what's your problem?
- I need to talk to you.

399
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:40,005
Better be life and death.

400
00:28:41,329 --> 00:28:42,887
Excuse me.

401
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:47,320
I'll just amuse myself.

402
00:28:48,609 --> 00:28:50,247
- Hi.
- Hey.

403
00:28:54,169 --> 00:28:55,488
Make it fast.

404
00:28:56,449 --> 00:28:59,088
- I just came from the morgue.
- Looking for a date?

405
00:28:59,249 --> 00:29:02,844
- No, checking on yours. She's a fraud.
- What are you talking about?

406
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04,601
Marcie Steadwell isn't
in the morgue,

407
00:29:04,769 --> 00:29:07,237
and I think the real Ms Hellfire is.

408
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:16,438
- I don't believe it.
- Barbas believes it.

409
00:29:29,169 --> 00:29:30,966
Marcie, please.

410
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:35,720
Favour us, Sister Moon
With your protective beams

411
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:37,197
Please stop.

412
00:29:37,369 --> 00:29:43,808
Give all who dwell within this spell
Safe days and sweet dreams

413
00:29:43,969 --> 00:29:45,766
Okay, that's all folks.

414
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:48,079
Who knew perky
could be so annoying?

415
00:29:48,249 --> 00:29:49,921
How long you think
I can keep her like this?

416
00:29:50,129 --> 00:29:53,007
Your power, your call.
Hey, did you reach Prue?

417
00:29:53,209 --> 00:29:55,120
No, she's still not answering her cell.

418
00:29:55,329 --> 00:29:57,763
She really should
have checked in by now.

419
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:00,446
- Maybe that's her.
- Ringing the bell?

420
00:30:00,649 --> 00:30:02,287
Well, maybe she lost her keys.

421
00:30:02,489 --> 00:30:04,605
Right, Marcie?

422
00:30:06,809 --> 00:30:08,606
- Dan!
- Hey, Piper.

423
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:09,918
Dan, wait...

424
00:30:10,089 --> 00:30:12,205
I wanted to bring this over
and leave it for my crew.

425
00:30:12,369 --> 00:30:14,121
They're having trouble
finding enough plywood.

426
00:30:14,289 --> 00:30:16,041
- Hey, Phoebe.
- Hey, Dan.

427
00:30:16,969 --> 00:30:19,767
Piper, don't forget about the...

428
00:30:19,969 --> 00:30:21,687
- Is this not a good time?
- Never. I mean,

429
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:25,768
always. Why don't you come in.
Come on back.

430
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:27,402
- Here let me help you.
- No, Piper.

431
00:30:27,569 --> 00:30:29,605
- No, I got it, really.
- Piper, I got it. Piper!

432
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:41,282
For those who dwell
Underneath this roof

433
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:45,006
Okay, you know, Marcie,
there's lots of rooms

434
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:47,125
that need protecting upstairs.

435
00:30:47,689 --> 00:30:49,680
Wait a minute, where did Piper go?

436
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,238
Oh, she just cast a little spell
of her own.

437
00:30:54,369 --> 00:30:56,929
Lots of rooms upstairs, honey.
Quietly, quietly.

438
00:31:00,729 --> 00:31:03,846
- So how are you doing?
- Fine, it wasn't that heavy.

439
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:06,643
No, I'm talking about everything.

440
00:31:07,369 --> 00:31:11,408
Oh, I'm fine with that too.
I'm actually a little stressed.

441
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,048
But everything is gonna be okay.

442
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:16,078
So have you thought
any more about my offer?

443
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:20,639
You know, I don't want to push you.

444
00:31:21,409 --> 00:31:22,888
I know, it's just,

445
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,398
every time I think
I have things figured out,

446
00:31:25,569 --> 00:31:27,446
things tend to shift.

447
00:31:28,209 --> 00:31:30,279
Well, what things?

448
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:35,367
Hey, you just let me know
when you're ready.

449
00:31:58,969 --> 00:32:02,928
You know, it's not midnight yet.
We still have time. Lots of time.

450
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:06,161
You think you could fool me
and get away with it?

451
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:08,564
- You killed the woman I loved.
- What are you saying?

452
00:32:08,769 --> 00:32:10,646
- You killed Hellfire!
- I am Hellfire.

453
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:12,401
Liar!

454
00:32:13,689 --> 00:32:18,365
So very nice
to see you again, Miss Halliwell.

455
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,408
Halliwell? From the list?

456
00:32:22,569 --> 00:32:26,118
Well, well, well.
Can't say that I'm surprised.

457
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:29,241
Your greatest fear
is that someone will kill your sisters.

458
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:31,559
- No.
- Oh, yes.

459
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:34,243
The demons are after them.

460
00:32:34,449 --> 00:32:36,485
Even as we speak,

461
00:32:36,649 --> 00:32:41,279
they have assumed your sisters'
identities in order to kill them.

462
00:32:41,969 --> 00:32:44,767
You must kill the impostors first,

463
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,328
by midnight.

464
00:32:47,289 --> 00:32:50,520
- Kill the impostors.
- Yes.

465
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,727
Then I get to deal with her.

466
00:33:04,489 --> 00:33:05,842
- Hey, Darryl.
- Phoebe.

467
00:33:06,049 --> 00:33:07,448
Come on in.

468
00:33:08,889 --> 00:33:12,598
Thanks for coming so fast.
We need you to babysit.

469
00:33:12,849 --> 00:33:15,443
- Is this one breathing?
- Yes, this one is breathing.

470
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:16,928
Good. Where are you headed?

471
00:33:17,089 --> 00:33:20,081
To find Prue.
She's impersonating the hit woman.

472
00:33:20,249 --> 00:33:22,001
- What?
- It's a long story,

473
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,047
and you wouldn't like it, but she
was supposed to check in by now.

474
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:27,643
- I'm going with you.
- No, no. No, you can't.

475
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:29,765
I appreciate it,
but you can't come with us.

476
00:33:29,969 --> 00:33:32,608
You don't have to hide
anything from me anymore.

477
00:33:32,769 --> 00:33:33,918
I know that, Darryl,

478
00:33:34,089 --> 00:33:36,603
but believe me, you don't wanna
be anywhere near us right now.

479
00:33:36,769 --> 00:33:39,158
We would never forgive ourselves
if anything happened to you.

480
00:33:39,329 --> 00:33:42,127
- I won't wind up like Andy.
- We won't let that happen.

481
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:46,726
Which cleanses the aura of the house
and makes it strong.

482
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:49,284
Give me strength. Hi, Darryl.

483
00:33:49,449 --> 00:33:51,883
Piper. You're gonna have to come
with me, Miss Steadwell.

484
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:54,517
Okay. Thanks for everything,
Marcie. Bye-bye.

485
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:56,805
Oh, is this about
the explosion at my shop?

486
00:33:56,969 --> 00:34:00,006
Yes. Until we close the case,
you'd be safer with me.

487
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:03,127
Oh, I think you have
that backwards, inspector.

488
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:04,887
You see, the protection spell
I cast

489
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:07,688
has been doing such a bang-up job
for these girls.

490
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:11,239
Just think what it could do for you.

491
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:15,769
Okay, well, we thank you
for that protection spell.

492
00:34:15,929 --> 00:34:17,999
Thank you so much,
and now we have to go now.

493
00:34:18,169 --> 00:34:19,488
Okay.

494
00:34:19,649 --> 00:34:23,244
Come, inspector,
my work here is done.

495
00:34:23,409 --> 00:34:25,320
Why don't we just leave this here.

496
00:34:33,809 --> 00:34:35,879
Are you sure that was the Porsche
parked out front?

497
00:34:36,049 --> 00:34:39,166
- Positive. Prue's here somewhere.
- Let's just hope she's alone.

498
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:44,085
- Prue.
- We've been so worried.

499
00:34:46,129 --> 00:34:47,164
Prue!

500
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,007
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not!

501
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:57,565
Come on. Crazy sister. Crazy sister.
Easy, easy.

502
00:34:57,809 --> 00:35:01,438
- What is going on?
- I think you need to freeze her fast.

503
00:35:01,609 --> 00:35:02,962
Good witches don't freeze,
remember?

504
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:04,926
She doesn't look so good right now.

505
00:35:05,129 --> 00:35:06,721
I won't let you kill my sisters.

506
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:12,362
- She flipped out.
- Patio, fast. Come on.

507
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:27,640
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing? Don't, don't.

508
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:31,882
She doesn't know we're her sisters.

509
00:35:32,049 --> 00:35:34,563
Okay, we gotta make her choose.
We have to convince astral Prue.

510
00:35:34,729 --> 00:35:36,640
Make her wanna be
in two places at once. Ready?

511
00:35:36,809 --> 00:35:38,367
- Yeah.
- Okay, go.

512
00:35:41,009 --> 00:35:42,806
Hi.

513
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:45,719
Come on, Prue, come get me.
Come on.

514
00:35:45,929 --> 00:35:47,408
No, it's me you want, over here.

515
00:35:48,089 --> 00:35:51,001
- No, Prudence, come on, me.
- No, me.

516
00:35:54,289 --> 00:35:55,768
Phoebe!

517
00:35:58,369 --> 00:36:00,929
Phoebe, we need to hurry
before she becomes one again.

518
00:36:04,049 --> 00:36:05,448
Phoebe!

519
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:09,685
Prue, Barbas has brainwashed you.

520
00:36:09,849 --> 00:36:11,646
You're going to hurt my sisters.

521
00:36:12,729 --> 00:36:14,845
Prue, we're your sisters.

522
00:36:15,809 --> 00:36:18,243
Listen to me.
You gave me the chickenpox.

523
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:21,128
Yeah, and remember,
I taught you how to French kiss.

524
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:23,604
You broke your ankle
when you were 7. Come on, Prue.

525
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:26,966
We went to Duran Duran together.
You stretched out my legwarmers.

526
00:36:27,129 --> 00:36:28,448
And then you gave them to me.

527
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:30,368
How do you know all this?

528
00:36:31,169 --> 00:36:33,000
Because we're your sisters, Prue.

529
00:36:33,609 --> 00:36:35,167
Sisters?

530
00:36:37,609 --> 00:36:38,598
Get over here.

531
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:49,363
Prue.

532
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:53,001
- Are you with us?
- I want Barbas.

533
00:36:53,289 --> 00:36:56,201
All we have to do is lay low until
midnight, and then he'll disappear

534
00:36:56,369 --> 00:36:58,360
and go back to wherever the hell
it is he came from.

535
00:36:58,529 --> 00:37:01,726
No, if he's back early,
who knows what rules apply or don't.

536
00:37:02,169 --> 00:37:03,602
I don't want to take any chances.

537
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:05,646
Let's go show him
what his greatest fear is.

538
00:37:12,849 --> 00:37:14,999
If she's not back in one minute,

539
00:37:15,169 --> 00:37:17,967
then I'm going to spend
my last two minutes killing you.

540
00:37:18,129 --> 00:37:20,120
Hey, I didn't come to you.
You came to me, remember?

541
00:37:20,289 --> 00:37:21,563
That's right.

542
00:37:21,729 --> 00:37:24,482
And if you hadn't been blinded
by your passion,

543
00:37:24,649 --> 00:37:27,925
then I would be minutes away
from freedom right now.

544
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:34,282
- Are they dead?
- They're right where they belong.

545
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:36,400
- Kill them!
- No!

546
00:37:39,369 --> 00:37:43,248
Oh, I'm beginning to see
your attraction to the dark side.

547
00:37:43,409 --> 00:37:46,048
It wasn't just his dark side
I was attracted to.

548
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:47,801
Do you think
you can just unfreeze him?

549
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:50,563
I don't know, I've never tried.

550
00:37:53,769 --> 00:37:55,760
Okay.

551
00:38:01,649 --> 00:38:03,082
Looking for this?

552
00:38:03,249 --> 00:38:06,400
- What's going on?
- Witchcraft at its best.

553
00:38:17,569 --> 00:38:19,844
No. No!

554
00:38:24,769 --> 00:38:30,799
No. No! No!

555
00:38:35,769 --> 00:38:37,760
I never get tired of kicking his butt.

556
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:44,802
Just a little something
to think about, in jail.

557
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:47,644
It won't be the only thing
I think about, I promise.

558
00:38:48,489 --> 00:38:50,525
Is that a threat?

559
00:38:51,049 --> 00:38:53,404
No. It's a compliment.

560
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:06,039
Dan did a really good job
with these windows.

561
00:39:06,209 --> 00:39:08,439
He is obviously
very good with his hands.

562
00:39:08,609 --> 00:39:10,679
Hey, hands off those hands.

563
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:14,484
So did you decide whether or not
you're gonna move in with him?

564
00:39:15,249 --> 00:39:17,240
I have to admit, it's very tempting.

565
00:39:17,409 --> 00:39:19,479
Yeah, well, you know,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

566
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,207
And you deserve to be happy.

567
00:39:21,649 --> 00:39:23,685
And don't worry about us.
We'll be fine.

568
00:39:23,889 --> 00:39:25,402
Especially if I get your room.

569
00:39:26,249 --> 00:39:29,241
Yes, you could have my room.
That is, if I was moving out.

570
00:39:29,449 --> 00:39:32,009
Oh, you're not gonna move out?
Oh, that's so good

571
00:39:32,169 --> 00:39:34,922
because you need to be with
your sisters just a little while longer.

572
00:39:36,009 --> 00:39:39,240
I adore Dan, but it's just way too soon
for me to move in with him.

573
00:39:39,409 --> 00:39:41,445
There's a few things
I need to figure out first.

574
00:39:41,609 --> 00:39:43,759
- Are you happy now?
- I'm delirious.

575
00:39:44,369 --> 00:39:45,643
Thank you.

576
00:39:45,809 --> 00:39:48,642
Well, just tell Marcie
that she can sell the ring

577
00:39:48,809 --> 00:39:50,925
and use the money
to rebuild the bookstore.

578
00:39:51,129 --> 00:39:53,120
Tell her it's a thank-you
for protecting us.

579
00:39:53,649 --> 00:39:57,278
No, Darryl, the ring is not hot.
I'll talk to you later.

580
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,365
So, what else did Hellfire
get from Bane?

581
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:05,400
Diamond necklaces, bracelets,
a Hockney, a Salvador Dalí.

582
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:07,520
You can't really keep
all that stuff, can you?

583
00:40:08,769 --> 00:40:10,725
No.

584
00:40:10,929 --> 00:40:12,760
No. It wouldn't really be right.

585
00:40:12,929 --> 00:40:15,921
But maybe I can figure out a way to
use it for some good and save my job.

586
00:40:16,089 --> 00:40:19,764
And if not, I can always astral project
and job-hunt twice as fast.

587
00:40:19,929 --> 00:40:24,081
Sure, just rub it in. I would love
to be in two places at once.

588
00:40:24,249 --> 00:40:27,047
As long as one of those places is fun,
I'll be happy.

589
00:40:27,209 --> 00:40:29,928
I think I may have learned
a few things from Ms Hellfire.

590
00:40:30,289 --> 00:40:33,247
You know, change my routine,
shake things up a little bit.

591
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:39,562
Jack.

592
00:40:39,889 --> 00:40:43,120
You know, Prue, it is bad enough
that you don't answer your phone,

593
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:46,565
come into the office or otherwise
appear to be doing your job.

594
00:40:46,729 --> 00:40:49,038
But now you're gonna take me
down with you.

595
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:50,682
What have you got
to say for yourself?

596
00:40:51,289 --> 00:40:53,849
Two hundred
and seventy-five thousand dollars.

597
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:55,363
Excuse me?

598
00:40:55,529 --> 00:40:58,885
It's the market value of the anonymous
estate donation I've been out acquiring.

599
00:40:59,049 --> 00:41:02,041
The one request is that all proceeds
go to Stop the Violence Foundation.

600
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,325
Not bad for a day's work, now, is it?

601
00:41:05,889 --> 00:41:09,086
No, it certainly isn't.

602
00:41:09,449 --> 00:41:12,088
You know, I never doubted you
for a moment, partner.

603
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:13,768
Liar.

604
00:41:15,089 --> 00:41:18,320
Let's go celebrate. Partner.

605
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:22,402
Okay.
