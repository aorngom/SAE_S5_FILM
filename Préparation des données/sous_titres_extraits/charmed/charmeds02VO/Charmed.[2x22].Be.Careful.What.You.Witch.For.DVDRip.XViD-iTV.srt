1
00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:05,478
The Council will remind you
of the heavy losses

2
00:00:05,649 --> 00:00:08,004
emanating from this San Francisco.

3
00:00:08,169 --> 00:00:10,478
From what we have learned,

4
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:15,598
all of the witches there
have been charmed.

5
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:19,444
I descend from a long
line of Dragon warlocks.

6
00:00:19,609 --> 00:00:22,248
When my father died,
he left me two things:

7
00:00:22,409 --> 00:00:24,161
The power of flight,

8
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:28,641
and the passionate hatred
for those who killed him, witches.

9
00:00:28,809 --> 00:00:32,563
And I will not rest until
I put all witches to rest.

10
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:35,323
The Council is intrigued.

11
00:00:35,529 --> 00:00:42,446
However, all who have used force
on these witches before have failed.

12
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,759
There is another way.

13
00:00:56,569 --> 00:00:59,288
A genie? You can't be serious.

14
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:01,559
Tell them what you told me.

15
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,565
Well, actually, that was kind of a
just-between-you-and-me thing.

16
00:01:07,729 --> 00:01:10,368
- Tell it!
- All right.

17
00:01:10,849 --> 00:01:15,525
Well, personally, I think
that the best way to destroy witches

18
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:18,999
is not to treat them
like witches at all.

19
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:21,524
You treat them like humans.

20
00:01:21,729 --> 00:01:24,004
Most of your evildoers,
naughty types,

21
00:01:24,169 --> 00:01:27,320
think it's best to deprive
humans of what they desire.

22
00:01:27,489 --> 00:01:31,084
No. You want to get them,
you give them exactly what they desire.

23
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:35,481
You grant them their wishes,
it'll lead to their undoing.

24
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:39,039
We don't know that. He's a genie!

25
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:41,564
If Council agrees,
how do we proceed?

26
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:46,878
Well, just make sure that the bottle
cross paths with the witches

27
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:50,359
and let El Genie Grande
take it from there.

28
00:01:50,609 --> 00:01:53,681
With all due respect,
genies only work for themselves.

29
00:01:53,889 --> 00:01:56,722
If he grants them three wishes,
he goes free.

30
00:01:57,129 --> 00:01:59,165
How do you know
that he won't betray you?

31
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:05,086
Remember, getting your freedom
does not make you free from us.

32
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:09,242
As long as you are a genie,
we can find you anytime.

33
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:12,924
Anywhere.

34
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:17,564
Check my to-do list.

35
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:19,799
It says "bank, dry cleaners,
pedicure."

36
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:22,608
Nowhere on the list
does it say "kick-box a beast."

37
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,403
Just walking along, minding my
own business, and wham!

38
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:29,198
It was like a random attack.
A demonic drive-by.

39
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,959
Nothing in our lives
is random anymore.

40
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:35,320
You know, we keep saying that,
but what does it really mean?

41
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,197
Is there some kind
of cosmic order to all this?

42
00:02:38,369 --> 00:02:41,281
Are we on some kind of list? And if so,
how many points are we worth?

43
00:02:41,649 --> 00:02:42,923
- Phoebe...
- What?

44
00:02:43,089 --> 00:02:45,478
We've had a great year.
We've wiped out a ton of nasties.

45
00:02:45,649 --> 00:02:50,484
I just want to know if we've tripped
some supernatural alarm or anything.

46
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,919
And are we ever gonna
learn what it really means?

47
00:02:55,089 --> 00:02:57,887
Well, not to sound
all whitelightery,

48
00:02:58,049 --> 00:02:59,641
but everything happens
in its own time.

49
00:02:59,809 --> 00:03:01,879
You know, you can't rush
what's to be.

50
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:05,719
Okay, how about what already is?
Dan is back in town.

51
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:08,358
- So?
- So, what am I gonna tell him?

52
00:03:08,649 --> 00:03:09,968
The last time I saw him,

53
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,960
he handed me proof
that you were killed in 1942.

54
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:13,562
He's gonna expect
a reaction from me.

55
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:16,283
How about, "Hey, Dan, you're right.
I am a necrophiliac."

56
00:03:16,449 --> 00:03:17,848
Phoebe.

57
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:20,648
Why does everyone always
"Phoebe" me?

58
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,684
- Hey.
- Where are you off to?

59
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:26,718
- Lunch date with Dick.
- Dull Dick?

60
00:03:27,289 --> 00:03:29,280
Prue, you are too hot
to have to duty date.

61
00:03:29,449 --> 00:03:31,121
Yeah, well, all demon-hunting
and no play

62
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:32,563
has made me a lot less picky.

63
00:03:32,729 --> 00:03:35,163
I gotta figure out a way to put
some more balance in my life.

64
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,087
Yeah, but you don't need Dick.

65
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:45,081
What I mean is, you should be excited
to see the guy you're dating.

66
00:03:45,249 --> 00:03:47,160
You look like you're off
to the Inquisition.

67
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:48,927
It's not that bad.

68
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,688
Okay, I have to go open the club.

69
00:03:50,889 --> 00:03:52,288
Are you gonna be all right, Pheebs?

70
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:54,519
Yes, and I think I'm... Thanks, Leo.

71
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:57,249
I'm gonna take a walk
and try to loosen up my ankle.

72
00:04:02,929 --> 00:04:04,442
What is that?

73
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:08,158
- I don't know.
- Somebody got a secret admirer?

74
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,163
It's so dusty. Who would send us
something so dusty?

75
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:25,842
Your wish is my command.

76
00:06:00,929 --> 00:06:01,964
I don't get it.

77
00:06:02,129 --> 00:06:04,085
You've been stuck in
that bottle for 200 years,

78
00:06:04,249 --> 00:06:05,682
someone finally sends you to us,

79
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:07,441
and you have no idea
who licked the stamp?

80
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:09,247
I kind of find that hard to believe.

81
00:06:09,529 --> 00:06:12,601
What, and a genie man standing
in our living room, wearing that,

82
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:14,646
offering to grant us
each a wish isn't?

83
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,008
Well, I don't get it.

84
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:20,445
You win the lotto
and you're asking for explanations?

85
00:06:20,689 --> 00:06:23,408
Actually we'd just like to know
who to send the thank-you note to.

86
00:06:23,609 --> 00:06:27,318
All I know is that you rubbed!

87
00:06:27,769 --> 00:06:29,248
And now I serve.

88
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:32,566
Look at that.

89
00:06:34,249 --> 00:06:35,477
Snacks.

90
00:06:38,249 --> 00:06:41,127
What I wouldn't give
to taste food just once.

91
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:43,808
Smell it even.

92
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:49,324
I don't trust him.
Genies are tricksters by nature.

93
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:51,963
They can and will do anything
just to be freed.

94
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:55,397
What are you, the butler? Come on!

95
00:06:55,609 --> 00:06:57,042
Everybody's got wishes.

96
00:06:57,249 --> 00:06:59,080
I mean, most people spend
their entire lives

97
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:02,286
with their wishes never coming true.
Here's your chance.

98
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:03,968
No way is this legit.

99
00:07:04,129 --> 00:07:06,563
Oh, you don't think so?
Well, I'll tell you what is.

100
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:10,763
I stay until I grant three wishes.
One from each of you.

101
00:07:10,969 --> 00:07:14,484
Those are the rules.
No wishes, permanent houseguest.

102
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:17,801
And I snore. I make phone calls
I can't even pay for.

103
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:20,967
You think I'm gonna be putting the
CDs back in the right case? No.

104
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,966
All right, talk amongst yourselves.

105
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:24,443
I'll be over here, all right?

106
00:07:24,609 --> 00:07:27,840
I have a hunch that I'm going
to be here for a while.

107
00:07:28,009 --> 00:07:30,079
This is a nice house.

108
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:37,008
He's enjoying this.

109
00:07:37,169 --> 00:07:39,399
All right, Leo, what else
do you know about genies?

110
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,322
Well, one good thing is
they're not evil by nature.

111
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:45,841
I mean, they can't harm you
unless you wish for something.

112
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,040
Well, I mean, what is so dangerous
about a wish?

113
00:07:48,209 --> 00:07:52,680
Well, with genies, there's always
a catch, an unseen consequence.

114
00:07:52,849 --> 00:07:55,522
For example,
say a man wishes for a car.

115
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:59,568
The next day, his dad will die,
and he'll inherit a car.

116
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,526
So as long as we don't wish...?

117
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:03,008
You're free and clear.

118
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:05,205
Clear enough to make a lunch date?

119
00:08:05,369 --> 00:08:08,042
If what Leo says goes,
you two go on ahead.

120
00:08:08,249 --> 00:08:11,161
Leave the genie with the cripple.
I'm not really in a wishing mood.

121
00:08:11,329 --> 00:08:12,444
Thank you, gimp.

122
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:14,361
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'll look through the Book

123
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,679
and see if we could UPS him
back to where he came from.

124
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:18,368
All right.

125
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:23,884
So, what's it gonna be, master?

126
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:30,647
So have you been here before?

127
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:35,445
It's close to the office.
I don't like to take long lunches.

128
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:39,362
What's good?

129
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:40,928
The Caesar's fine.

130
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:45,805
The pasta's fine.
The fish is fine.

131
00:08:46,049 --> 00:08:47,721
- Steak is...
- Fine.

132
00:08:48,929 --> 00:08:51,238
Yeah, actually.
How'd you know?

133
00:08:51,409 --> 00:08:54,003
Wild guess.

134
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:57,008
What have I gotten myself into?

135
00:08:58,089 --> 00:08:59,647
Hey, Dick.

136
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,999
Don't you just love butter?

137
00:09:06,169 --> 00:09:08,763
Creamy goodness.
To your health.

138
00:09:12,129 --> 00:09:13,118
Dick, are you...?

139
00:09:13,289 --> 00:09:14,961
Sick and tired of trying
to pass myself off

140
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:18,485
as even being halfway worthy
of dating you? You betcha!

141
00:09:18,649 --> 00:09:20,844
Look, you and I both know
I'm dull as mud.

142
00:09:21,049 --> 00:09:23,438
I can't help it. I know who I am.

143
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:25,645
I know I'm not the guy
you're looking for.

144
00:09:25,809 --> 00:09:26,798
I...

145
00:09:26,969 --> 00:09:29,563
The question is,
what are you looking for?

146
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,804
I mean, come on.

147
00:09:30,969 --> 00:09:33,961
How do we make it to date three
when you really know I'm not the guy?

148
00:09:34,689 --> 00:09:36,520
It's...

149
00:09:37,929 --> 00:09:38,998
I don't know.

150
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:46,002
You know, I mean,
at this point, I just...

151
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:48,729
...feel like dating is kind of a job,
you know.

152
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,007
I mean, you get numb, but you feel like
it's your duty to stay out there.

153
00:09:54,609 --> 00:09:57,077
I just want to feel excited
by love again.

154
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:02,641
I wish it was like it was the first time.

155
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:08,447
Your wish, my command.

156
00:10:19,609 --> 00:10:23,318
Hi. How about great fortune?
You want that?

157
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:25,565
- After taxes, not worth it.
- No?

158
00:10:25,729 --> 00:10:30,280
- Land? Power? Beauty?
- Nope.

159
00:10:30,889 --> 00:10:33,528
- Okay, who am I kidding.
- Why are you not in this book?

160
00:10:33,729 --> 00:10:36,721
Because the only way to get rid of me
is to make three wishes.

161
00:10:37,329 --> 00:10:40,241
Come on! Large or small.
I do all kinds.

162
00:10:40,449 --> 00:10:42,963
Only no world peace. I can't do that.

163
00:10:43,129 --> 00:10:46,166
The fine print of wishing.
Your job has its limitations.

164
00:10:46,369 --> 00:10:47,848
Yeah, well, so does yours.

165
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:51,286
Occupational hazard.

166
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:52,763
Doesn't have to be.

167
00:10:53,409 --> 00:10:56,526
You could wish to be
as powerful as you want.

168
00:10:58,329 --> 00:11:01,526
Nope. Nope.
I am not interested in that.

169
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:05,398
Oh, "not interested."
Not interested in absolute power.

170
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,368
You're a rocket scientist.

171
00:11:11,329 --> 00:11:12,808
I mean, poor Dan.

172
00:11:12,969 --> 00:11:15,722
It would just be so much easier
if I could be honest with him.

173
00:11:15,889 --> 00:11:18,244
But other than saying,
"Leo is a whitelighter,"

174
00:11:18,409 --> 00:11:19,728
what am I gonna tell him?

175
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,521
Well, what more does
he need to know?

176
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:25,479
Well, maybe it's about
what I need to know.

177
00:11:26,289 --> 00:11:28,564
I mean, you've been watching me
my whole life,

178
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,038
and I don't even know
where you spend yours.

179
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:33,201
If there's anything
you want to know...

180
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:36,600
It's not exactly about knowing,
it's more about experiencing,

181
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,725
and experiencing it with you.

182
00:11:38,929 --> 00:11:42,126
I mean, I have no idea where you go
when you orb out.

183
00:11:42,289 --> 00:11:45,406
Do you have a house?
Friends? A CD player?

184
00:11:45,609 --> 00:11:47,600
It's not really like that.

185
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:53,443
- Dan.
- You've got to be kidding me.

186
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:59,563
Wait.

187
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:02,323
I think it's time we talked.

188
00:12:03,249 --> 00:12:06,286
I don't think there's anything
to talk about, Piper.

189
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:08,002
It's your life.

190
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:11,728
Leo, can you give us
a second, please?

191
00:12:11,889 --> 00:12:14,119
Yeah, yeah.

192
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:21,798
What do you expect from me?
I'd really like to know.

193
00:12:21,969 --> 00:12:24,085
At this point, I don't know what
to expect from you.

194
00:12:24,289 --> 00:12:27,247
I mean, how can you be with this guy
after everything I found out about him?

195
00:12:27,409 --> 00:12:28,603
He's a fraud.

196
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:31,408
Dan, I know who Leo is.
I always have.

197
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:33,164
What?

198
00:12:33,369 --> 00:12:35,280
It's not that I don't appreciate
everything you...

199
00:12:35,449 --> 00:12:38,441
Wait. I've spent all this time
worrying about you,

200
00:12:38,969 --> 00:12:41,244
worrying about who he is...

201
00:12:42,049 --> 00:12:44,040
...and you've known all along?

202
00:12:44,209 --> 00:12:46,165
Well, it's...

203
00:12:46,569 --> 00:12:49,447
It's very complicated.

204
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,961
Complicated?

205
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:55,728
Complicated.

206
00:13:04,569 --> 00:13:06,287
He's right, he deserves to know.

207
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:09,561
But what am I gonna tell him?
What am I gonna do?

208
00:13:09,769 --> 00:13:14,320
I wish there was somehow
he could just move on with his life.

209
00:13:15,369 --> 00:13:19,078
Your wish, my command.

210
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:24,326
Do not do that!

211
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:25,638
Is that a wish?

212
00:13:25,849 --> 00:13:27,965
No, it is not a wish!

213
00:13:29,169 --> 00:13:32,081
So figure out how
to get rid of me yet?

214
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,007
Yeah, I have to get you
back in the bottle.

215
00:13:34,209 --> 00:13:36,439
I have no idea how to do that,
but I will figure it out.

216
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:37,928
Well, wish it and it will be so.

217
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:40,922
Otherwise, your only shot
is if I volunteer to leave willingly,

218
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:45,879
and, news flash,
that's not gonna happen.

219
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:47,638
I'm sorry.

220
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:50,642
Look, could you stop
trying to banish me

221
00:13:50,809 --> 00:13:53,243
just long enough for me to try
a little something on you?

222
00:13:53,409 --> 00:13:55,001
It's wish-free.

223
00:13:55,889 --> 00:13:57,641
All right.

224
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:14,004
- Where did you learn how to do that?
- Little something a sultan taught me.

225
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:19,800
Just out of curiosity,
what would you wish for yourself?

226
00:14:19,969 --> 00:14:22,164
I mean, you must have
heard them all, right?

227
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,206
So, what would be your wish?

228
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:27,008
Well, I mean, that's easy.

229
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:30,846
I'd wish for the little things, you know.
Things people take for granted.

230
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:34,126
I mean, the feeling of a suntan.

231
00:14:34,289 --> 00:14:37,804
Taste of ice cream,
preferably chocolate.

232
00:14:37,969 --> 00:14:41,245
Sex. That looks like that
could be a little bit of fun.

233
00:14:43,329 --> 00:14:45,479
I don't know, to be human.

234
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:50,559
Yeah. That's what I'd wish for.

235
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:53,084
So, what did you do
to yourself here?

236
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:57,162
I was demon-duelling, and one of
my kicks was a little off-centre.

237
00:14:57,329 --> 00:15:01,368
So did you finish them off
with your scary witchy power?

238
00:15:01,849 --> 00:15:04,443
No, that is my power.

239
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:07,277
- That's it?
- That and premonitions.

240
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,241
You're a witch with no real powers?

241
00:15:09,609 --> 00:15:12,681
I mean, no, you know,
premonitions, those are:

242
00:15:12,849 --> 00:15:15,682
- Those are great, but...
- I know. I know.

243
00:15:15,849 --> 00:15:18,682
I mean, I would love an active power,
but what can you do?

244
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:24,205
You've just done it!

245
00:15:24,529 --> 00:15:26,645
And I know exactly where to get one.

246
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,325
- Was that a...?
- A wish? Yeah.

247
00:15:29,609 --> 00:15:31,839
Yeah, it was.

248
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:36,287
And that's three, and I'm free.

249
00:15:36,449 --> 00:15:41,603
- Three? That wasn't even one.
- That's three, I'm gone. Yeah.

250
00:15:42,129 --> 00:15:44,848
Okay, if you're free,
then where's my power?

251
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,126
Hello? Genie.

252
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:57,206
I'll be right back.

253
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:01,959
Well, thank you very much
for your time, I appreciate it.

254
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,881
- Good luck.
- All right.

255
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:10,246
What's going on?

256
00:16:11,649 --> 00:16:13,560
I got a job offer in Portland.

257
00:16:13,729 --> 00:16:16,004
I just thought I'd take it.

258
00:16:16,449 --> 00:16:18,087
Just like that?

259
00:16:19,449 --> 00:16:23,158
I just think it's time that
I move on with my life, don't you?

260
00:16:25,049 --> 00:16:27,847
Look, I really gotta go.

261
00:16:29,729 --> 00:16:31,208
Right.

262
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:41,241
- Something's not right.
- But it's probably for the best.

263
00:16:41,409 --> 00:16:43,969
No, something he said
when I asked...

264
00:16:49,929 --> 00:16:51,760
Hey! Piper, check it out!

265
00:16:51,929 --> 00:16:56,480
Okay, so the valet guy said that this
cool ride is mine, can you believe it?

266
00:16:58,249 --> 00:16:59,967
Who's the cute boy?

267
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:02,561
Prue?

268
00:17:02,729 --> 00:17:03,844
Hey, are you okay?

269
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:07,399
I mean, don't take this the wrong way,
but you're looking kind of old.

270
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,560
Yeah, and you're back in braces.

271
00:17:11,129 --> 00:17:14,485
Help! Is anyone home?

272
00:17:14,649 --> 00:17:17,209
- Prue! Piper!
- Phoebe!

273
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,688
I'm up here.

274
00:17:21,769 --> 00:17:22,997
I can't get down.

275
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,608
I don't know how I got up.

276
00:17:31,369 --> 00:17:34,406
- Gently.
- I gotcha.

277
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:38,479
- Thank you, Leo.
- No problem.

278
00:17:40,009 --> 00:17:43,365
That is so totally cool.

279
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:45,924
So do I get that power
when I get old too?

280
00:17:46,089 --> 00:17:48,398
All right, let's get something straight.
We are not old,

281
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:51,083
we are just older than you are
right now, for some reason.

282
00:17:51,249 --> 00:17:54,366
Wait a minute.
Exactly how old are you?

283
00:17:54,529 --> 00:17:56,281
- Seventeen.
- Seventeen?

284
00:17:56,449 --> 00:17:58,007
Prue was a nightmare
at that age.

285
00:17:58,209 --> 00:18:00,928
- Why would she wish for that?
- She probably didn't.

286
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:04,280
She probably wished for something
she could only get by being 17.

287
00:18:04,489 --> 00:18:07,128
Which explains why she has
no memory of being older.

288
00:18:07,329 --> 00:18:09,889
But how is that even possible?
I mean, it's so we...

289
00:18:10,569 --> 00:18:12,287
Okay.

290
00:18:12,969 --> 00:18:15,085
All right, maybe you should
just keep your arms down

291
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:18,559
- till you learn to work the controls.
- Got it. Good idea.

292
00:18:18,769 --> 00:18:23,285
You sure you don't remember anything
about witches, genies, Dick?

293
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,161
No, but it sounds totally bitchen.

294
00:18:25,369 --> 00:18:29,362
- This is such a cool book, what is it?
- I'll tell you when you're older.

295
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:32,242
Let go of it. Stop it! Stop it!

296
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:34,400
You know, you guys
have another problem.

297
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:38,608
At 17, Prue didn't have her powers yet.
Makes you guys more vulnerable.

298
00:18:38,809 --> 00:18:42,040
Yeah, especially if whoever sent
the genie is a demon or something.

299
00:18:43,449 --> 00:18:46,168
Where's my power? I want it back!

300
00:18:46,369 --> 00:18:48,439
- Who is that?
- A demon or something.

301
00:18:48,609 --> 00:18:50,281
You stay here.

302
00:18:50,489 --> 00:18:52,445
- Come here!
- You stay.

303
00:18:57,529 --> 00:19:00,407
Remember what I told you about
wishes and the strings attached?

304
00:19:00,569 --> 00:19:03,925
That genie gave you a power,
but he must have stolen it from him.

305
00:19:04,089 --> 00:19:06,364
- Are we thinking demon or warlock?
- I don't know.

306
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:08,679
Oh, my God! Who's the hottie?

307
00:19:08,889 --> 00:19:10,880
Oh, my God.
Get her out of here, now!

308
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:13,045
- Go!
- Piper!

309
00:19:13,889 --> 00:19:15,720
Okay. Okay.

310
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:20,684
- Okay. All right.
- Easy, easy.

311
00:19:23,049 --> 00:19:24,038
Okay, now what?

312
00:19:24,489 --> 00:19:27,765
Well, we can't vanquish him
if we don't know what he is.

313
00:19:28,729 --> 00:19:32,608
So why don't I just fly him out of here
and dump him somewhere?

314
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:34,322
I don't know, can you do that?

315
00:19:34,529 --> 00:19:36,201
I have no idea,
but I could try to do that.

316
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:39,160
I mean, I've always wanted
an active power, right?

317
00:19:39,729 --> 00:19:41,481
So let's see what I can do.

318
00:19:41,649 --> 00:19:43,958
- All right.
- All right.

319
00:19:51,369 --> 00:19:53,200
Phoebe?

320
00:20:19,329 --> 00:20:22,287
Your new little sister's in the bedroom
checking out the clothes.

321
00:20:22,489 --> 00:20:25,606
Nice to see some things
never change.

322
00:20:25,769 --> 00:20:28,647
I think I found our fire-breather.

323
00:20:28,809 --> 00:20:31,801
- Guys! Hello!
- A Dragon warlock.

324
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:34,437
Most feared witch-killer there is.

325
00:20:34,649 --> 00:20:38,005
He can fly, breathe fire,
has supernatural strength.

326
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:40,478
You're gonna need the power of three
to vanquish him.

327
00:20:40,649 --> 00:20:42,480
Which we don't have right now.

328
00:20:42,689 --> 00:20:46,045
If I ever find that genie again,
I'm gonna wish him into oblivion.

329
00:20:47,729 --> 00:20:50,084
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

330
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:59,207
Oh, my God. Are you all right?

331
00:20:59,409 --> 00:21:01,479
- I'm great.
- All right, okay. All right.

332
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:06,487
Flying's awesome.
It's the landing part that's a bitch.

333
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:08,367
Yeah.

334
00:21:08,529 --> 00:21:10,360
All right, Leo. How do we fix this?

335
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,127
I know how to fix it.

336
00:21:12,329 --> 00:21:14,923
According to the Book, we gotta
get the genie back in the bottle.

337
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:17,557
It's the only way to undo the wishes
and make everything normal.

338
00:21:17,729 --> 00:21:20,004
First, we gotta find him,
and we don't know where to start.

339
00:21:20,209 --> 00:21:22,484
Well, he's really got a thing for food.

340
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:25,038
Maybe he went back to that café
where he found Prue.

341
00:21:25,369 --> 00:21:26,961
It's worth a try.

342
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:40,040
This guy's not a genie, he's a pig.

343
00:21:40,809 --> 00:21:42,800
Hi.

344
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:44,925
Want to know what
I'm wishing for now?

345
00:21:45,089 --> 00:21:48,320
Look, you're probably
a little bit upset, huh?

346
00:21:48,489 --> 00:21:51,845
No, I've moved past upset
and right to pissed off!

347
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,164
You tricked us,

348
00:21:53,329 --> 00:21:55,763
and now there's a warlock
trying to turn us into witch kabobs.

349
00:21:56,809 --> 00:21:58,561
Warlock? What warlock?

350
00:21:58,769 --> 00:22:01,488
A Dragon warlock. The one you stole
the flying power from?

351
00:22:01,689 --> 00:22:04,920
- You remember him?
- He came already?

352
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,723
Wait a second. How did he know
where to look for you?

353
00:22:07,929 --> 00:22:10,318
- I don't know, you tell us.
- Well, I didn't tell him.

354
00:22:11,169 --> 00:22:14,479
Look, he probably just tracked it
somehow, that's all.

355
00:22:14,649 --> 00:22:16,401
I don't know.
We're not partners.

356
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,888
I got this gig on my own.

357
00:22:18,049 --> 00:22:19,368
Wait, "gig"?

358
00:22:20,249 --> 00:22:22,126
So somebody did send you.
Who was it?

359
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:27,405
Well, you see, that's part of
the whole genie-client privilege thing.

360
00:22:27,569 --> 00:22:31,403
I couldn't possibly tell.
Yeah, plus, that and they'll kill me.

361
00:22:31,609 --> 00:22:33,918
They're gonna have to wait in line.
Let's go, put that down.

362
00:22:34,089 --> 00:22:36,080
All right, just one more.
That chocolate's so good.

363
00:22:36,249 --> 00:22:38,240
- Put that down.
- You know, you are a real killjoy.

364
00:22:38,409 --> 00:22:42,368
You know what? You're going
right back in that bottle, buddy.

365
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:44,002
What happened? Where did he go?

366
00:22:44,169 --> 00:22:46,080
I thought you said freed genies
don't have powers.

367
00:22:46,249 --> 00:22:50,447
They don't. Somebody who does
must have wanted him, badly.

368
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:56,648
It has come to our attention
that you violated our pact.

369
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,447
Your accuser will speak.

370
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:01,119
He used the Halliwell wishes,
not to destroy them,

371
00:23:01,689 --> 00:23:03,725
but to free himself from his bottle.

372
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:06,404
What do you say to this charge?

373
00:23:06,609 --> 00:23:10,682
It was all part of the master plan,
all right?

374
00:23:10,849 --> 00:23:13,124
And those witches
would be dead right now

375
00:23:13,289 --> 00:23:15,439
if Puff over here hadn't
screwed everything up.

376
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:17,242
Screwed everything up?

377
00:23:18,649 --> 00:23:19,718
You stole a power from me.

378
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:22,602
Borrowed, okay?
The term is "borrowed."

379
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:26,768
And I knew that it would
piss you off so bad

380
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:29,164
that you would be
that much more motivated

381
00:23:29,329 --> 00:23:32,844
to get out there
and kill you some witches, right?

382
00:23:33,049 --> 00:23:35,643
But your plan failed.

383
00:23:35,809 --> 00:23:38,607
The Dragon's attack was thwarted.

384
00:23:39,729 --> 00:23:42,766
Look, you don't go after
the witches with power.

385
00:23:43,449 --> 00:23:45,246
You go after the one without.

386
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,722
Cool.

387
00:24:06,889 --> 00:24:07,878
Hello?

388
00:24:08,689 --> 00:24:11,283
When I first got the call,
I naturally dismissed it as a crank,

389
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:13,679
until I realized it was the deputy mayor
on the other end.

390
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:16,762
Okay, Darryl, can you speed this up,
because I'm kind of busy right now.

391
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:18,806
What, flying?

392
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:23,999
Now, see, I've learned to interpret
those pauses as admission.

393
00:24:24,449 --> 00:24:26,599
- What did he see?
- Actually it was his wife.

394
00:24:26,769 --> 00:24:30,398
Who swore she saw a brown-haired
woman fly over the house earlier.

395
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,558
Without a plane.

396
00:24:32,249 --> 00:24:35,321
- How about a broomstick?
- Phoebe, this isn't funny.

397
00:24:35,489 --> 00:24:37,480
Just the fact that a call like that
got routed to me

398
00:24:37,649 --> 00:24:39,879
gives you some idea of
the pressure that I'm under here.

399
00:24:40,969 --> 00:24:43,039
- Phoebe?
- In here!

400
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:48,124
Okay, Darryl, I'm really sorry, okay?
It won't happen again. I gotta go. Bye.

401
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:51,883
- You didn't find the genie?
- We did, but then we lost him.

402
00:24:52,049 --> 00:24:53,038
Where's Prue?

403
00:24:53,209 --> 00:24:55,723
Upstairs, reminding me
what a pain she was at 17.

404
00:24:55,929 --> 00:24:57,999
Now you know why she was
lucky to make it to 18.

405
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:01,884
- Why? What do you mean?
- Well, you remember better than I do.

406
00:25:02,049 --> 00:25:03,482
It was Prue's rebellious stage.

407
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:05,480
She thought everything bad
was good,

408
00:25:05,649 --> 00:25:07,685
especially the guy she thought
she was in love with.

409
00:25:07,849 --> 00:25:10,079
- Until he attacked her.
- What?

410
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:12,359
And Grams went crazy
when she found out.

411
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:15,123
Come to think of it, that guy
disappeared not too long after that.

412
00:25:15,289 --> 00:25:16,802
You don't supposed Grams...?

413
00:25:17,529 --> 00:25:19,679
I'll get it. You go watch Prue.

414
00:25:26,369 --> 00:25:28,246
Can I help you?

415
00:25:28,409 --> 00:25:32,607
Piper, why the hell is
this happening to me?

416
00:25:32,769 --> 00:25:35,283
Prue snuck out of her window.
We have to go find her.

417
00:25:35,449 --> 00:25:38,566
Phoebe, that's Dan.

418
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:02,605
How about a lift?

419
00:26:09,249 --> 00:26:11,968
- She's not answering.
- Well, maybe she doesn't know how.

420
00:26:12,129 --> 00:26:13,801
Were there even cell phones
ten years ago?

421
00:26:14,249 --> 00:26:17,446
She knows what a ringing phone
sounds like, doesn't she?

422
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:20,282
Maybe I should fly around
and see if I could spot her car.

423
00:26:20,449 --> 00:26:22,758
You'll never be able to find it.
You have a hard enough time

424
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:25,443
controlling the power in the daytime,
let alone at night.

425
00:26:25,609 --> 00:26:27,440
Why can't I get a premonition
when I want to?

426
00:26:28,369 --> 00:26:31,964
If I had one wish right now,
that's what it would be.

427
00:26:32,369 --> 00:26:35,247
At least your wish isn't hurting anyone.
Look what mine did.

428
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:37,562
It's not your fault.

429
00:26:38,009 --> 00:26:39,283
How can it not be?

430
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:42,964
Dan is aging because I wished
for him to move on with his life.

431
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:45,199
He would be fine if it wasn't for me.

432
00:26:46,689 --> 00:26:48,645
It's not fair, he doesn't deserve this.

433
00:26:48,809 --> 00:26:52,927
It's bad enough the wishes are
biting us in the ass, but not him.

434
00:26:53,169 --> 00:26:55,763
This shouldn't be happening to him.

435
00:26:56,649 --> 00:27:00,198
We have to find the genie.
It's the only way to save Dan.

436
00:27:00,929 --> 00:27:02,567
And Prue.

437
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:08,678
So, what, you don't have a name?

438
00:27:08,849 --> 00:27:11,124
Well, I go by a lot of names.

439
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:12,882
Depends where I am.

440
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:15,720
So why are my sisters
scared of you?

441
00:27:16,489 --> 00:27:18,002
Why did you come
to our house tonight?

442
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:20,558
Because they have something
that I want.

443
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:22,482
Something that's mine.

444
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,446
Are you scared of me?

445
00:27:30,489 --> 00:27:32,047
No.

446
00:27:45,489 --> 00:27:46,558
Okay.

447
00:27:47,329 --> 00:27:50,082
God, it's ringing again.
How do you turn it off?

448
00:27:59,249 --> 00:28:00,728
Hey, easy.

449
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:03,648
Okay. Hey, hey, easy.

450
00:28:04,569 --> 00:28:06,127
Easy!

451
00:28:06,409 --> 00:28:09,242
Are you scared of me now?

452
00:28:18,209 --> 00:28:21,167
It won't be too long before she calls
her sisters to come and rescue her.

453
00:28:21,329 --> 00:28:23,445
It's the perfect trap.

454
00:28:24,009 --> 00:28:25,601
You didn't hurt her, did you?

455
00:28:25,769 --> 00:28:27,760
Because I thought I heard screams.

456
00:28:27,929 --> 00:28:29,965
You've spent too much time
with humans already.

457
00:28:30,129 --> 00:28:32,199
Developing a conscience.

458
00:28:33,289 --> 00:28:36,042
You want your freedom,
you do exactly as I say.

459
00:28:36,209 --> 00:28:38,803
- You understand?
- Absolutely.

460
00:28:46,209 --> 00:28:49,246
Dan, I'm so sorry.

461
00:28:50,489 --> 00:28:52,445
I don't understand.

462
00:28:56,009 --> 00:28:58,603
This is gonna be hard
for me to explain,

463
00:28:58,769 --> 00:29:01,886
and even harder for you to believe.

464
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:04,288
We're witches.

465
00:29:04,689 --> 00:29:06,805
Prue, Phoebe and myself.

466
00:29:07,009 --> 00:29:10,445
And not your everyday
kind of witches.

467
00:29:10,609 --> 00:29:14,397
We have supernatural powers
that we use to fight off...

468
00:29:16,689 --> 00:29:18,327
...demons and warlocks.

469
00:29:19,129 --> 00:29:22,724
You know, all the family emergencies
that I used to have.

470
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:28,487
I never told you before because I didn't
want you to be hurt because of it.

471
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:31,322
I didn't want something like this
to happen to you.

472
00:29:34,129 --> 00:29:38,884
And I'm the same Leo Wyatt
that died in 1942.

473
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:43,646
I'm a whitelighter,
a guardian angel for witches.

474
00:29:43,849 --> 00:29:46,568
Yeah, right.

475
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:27,641
Piper!

476
00:30:28,649 --> 00:30:31,243
I just had a premonition.
I have no idea what it means.

477
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:37,122
- Hello?
- Oh, my God. Piper.

478
00:30:37,289 --> 00:30:38,768
Thank God. You have to help me.

479
00:30:39,249 --> 00:30:41,001
- Prue?
- Where is she?

480
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:44,286
Piper, he's trying to kill me. Dragon.

481
00:30:44,769 --> 00:30:47,124
He's trying to kill me,
and I don't think he's human.

482
00:30:47,329 --> 00:30:49,047
Okay, calm down.

483
00:30:49,209 --> 00:30:51,677
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

484
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:55,478
I think he's following me.
You have to come quick!

485
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:57,401
Okay. Prue, where are you?

486
00:30:57,609 --> 00:30:58,678
Golden Gate Park.

487
00:30:58,849 --> 00:30:59,884
Okay, listen to me.

488
00:31:00,049 --> 00:31:03,166
Go to the lake where Dad used to
take us fishing, remember?

489
00:31:03,329 --> 00:31:05,445
And hide under the bridge
until we get there, okay?

490
00:31:07,409 --> 00:31:08,524
I think he's coming!

491
00:31:08,729 --> 00:31:10,481
Prue? Prue!

492
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:13,879
- What?
- Dragon's after her.

493
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:16,404
Well, it's a trap.
You know it's a trap.

494
00:31:16,569 --> 00:31:18,321
Doesn't matter, Leo.
We have to go anyway.

495
00:31:18,489 --> 00:31:19,968
Well, at least go with a plan.

496
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,807
Try using your new power,
fly overhead,

497
00:31:21,969 --> 00:31:25,518
- and spot him before he spots you.
- All right.

498
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,445
- Stay with Dan, we'll be back.
- You better be.

499
00:31:28,609 --> 00:31:30,725
We gotta hurry,
it's gonna be light soon.

500
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:51,640
Okay, you think you can
control the power this time?

501
00:31:51,809 --> 00:31:53,481
I'll have to, I have no choice.

502
00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:55,640
Right, I spot the Dragon,
you freeze him.

503
00:31:55,809 --> 00:31:57,720
Then we find Prue
and get the hell out of here.

504
00:31:57,889 --> 00:32:00,449
All right, go. Fly.

505
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:17,519
Piper! Piper! Piper!

506
00:32:17,729 --> 00:32:19,685
- Prue?
- Piper!

507
00:32:20,049 --> 00:32:21,880
- No! Prue.
- Piper!

508
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:23,482
Go back!

509
00:32:23,689 --> 00:32:25,884
- Go! Go!
- Piper!

510
00:32:26,689 --> 00:32:28,042
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

511
00:32:28,209 --> 00:32:30,006
- I'm sorry.
- Let go!

512
00:32:31,369 --> 00:32:32,643
Let go of her, damn it!

513
00:32:33,409 --> 00:32:34,558
No, I can't.

514
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:35,997
- Piper!
- No!

515
00:32:40,889 --> 00:32:43,005
Come on, keep coming.

516
00:32:43,209 --> 00:32:45,643
- Come and save your little sister.
- No!

517
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,762
No. No. No!

518
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:52,205
- No!
- Prue.

519
00:32:53,889 --> 00:32:55,402
Prue!

520
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,567
Time to get my power back.

521
00:33:02,129 --> 00:33:03,687
Let go!

522
00:33:06,569 --> 00:33:07,604
Prue!

523
00:33:12,649 --> 00:33:15,721
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

524
00:33:15,929 --> 00:33:19,080
Oh, my God!
What do we do? What do we do?

525
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,286
Leo can heal her. I know he can.
We just need to get her home.

526
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:24,360
Go get the car, Phoebe.
Go get the car!

527
00:33:24,849 --> 00:33:26,840
Oh, my God!

528
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:30,565
Oh, God, what have I done?

529
00:33:31,529 --> 00:33:34,202
Leo! Leo!

530
00:33:36,209 --> 00:33:39,963
- What happened?
- Never mind, just heal her. Come on.

531
00:33:46,009 --> 00:33:48,284
What's the matter?
Why isn't it working?

532
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,599
Leo?

533
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:52,687
I can't heal the dead.

534
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:56,446
Yes, you can.

535
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:13,568
What the hell is he doing here?

536
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:15,924
Wait, wait, just hear him out.
He may have an idea.

537
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:19,199
Listen, I'm so sorry.

538
00:34:19,529 --> 00:34:22,089
All I ever wanted was
my freedom, that's it.

539
00:34:22,249 --> 00:34:25,082
That's all
that I was thinking about. Look...

540
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:28,685
...l'm just a genie.
- Get to the point!

541
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,646
He's willing to give up his freedom.

542
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:33,445
Go back in the bottle
and reverse the wishes.

543
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:35,605
I'll return everything
to the way it was.

544
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:38,881
- Even Prue?
- It should.

545
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:42,359
I mean, teenage Prue is the one
that got killed, not adult Prue.

546
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:46,165
How do we know this
isn't just another trick?

547
00:34:46,809 --> 00:34:49,084
Well, if it gets Prue back,

548
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:51,444
you'd have the power of three
to vanquish the Dragon.

549
00:34:52,249 --> 00:34:53,568
What do you got to lose?

550
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:07,884
After you.

551
00:35:25,649 --> 00:35:27,367
Try to fly.

552
00:35:42,449 --> 00:35:44,121
Prue.

553
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:49,157
It worked, Dan's...

554
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:51,921
No, it didn't.

555
00:35:52,129 --> 00:35:54,040
All it did was turn her back
into her adult self.

556
00:35:54,209 --> 00:35:56,086
- It didn't save her.
- Wait.

557
00:35:56,249 --> 00:35:58,479
The genie is back in the bottle,
so if we can get him out,

558
00:35:58,649 --> 00:36:00,162
then we have three
more wishes, right?

559
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:02,604
All we need is one.

560
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:12,999
- Piper?
- Dan, get down!

561
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:23,886
- Did you see where the bottle went?
- No, I have no id... Wait, yeah.

562
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,324
In my premonition.

563
00:36:26,529 --> 00:36:28,918
- You distract him.
- Right.

564
00:36:30,849 --> 00:36:33,602
Too bad you don't have
my power anymore!

565
00:36:33,769 --> 00:36:35,839
Hey Dragon-breath, over here.

566
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:45,081
I wish Prue were alive.

567
00:36:45,809 --> 00:36:48,198
Piper, go check on Prue.

568
00:36:48,409 --> 00:36:51,845
- Where the hell did you come from?
- No, no, that's where you came from.

569
00:36:52,289 --> 00:36:56,805
The power of three will set us free
The power of three will set us free

570
00:36:57,489 --> 00:37:02,802
The power of three will set us free
The power of three will set us free.

571
00:37:20,769 --> 00:37:21,758
Hi.

572
00:37:22,409 --> 00:37:24,604
Look, Piper, I really don't feel
like talking right now.

573
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,801
Wait, wait. We're gonna
have to talk some time.

574
00:37:27,969 --> 00:37:29,960
No. We don't.

575
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:34,680
I don't know how you expected me
to react to your secret, but I don't...

576
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:38,083
I'm really sorry you told me.

577
00:37:39,489 --> 00:37:43,368
I wish you never did.
I wish I never saw what I saw.

578
00:37:44,009 --> 00:37:47,445
I never imagined
things like that even...

579
00:37:49,129 --> 00:37:50,721
...existed.

580
00:37:50,929 --> 00:37:52,806
- Dan...
- Please, just go away.

581
00:37:53,209 --> 00:37:54,847
I don't want to know any more.

582
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:57,517
And I don't want to know
any more about you.

583
00:38:09,769 --> 00:38:12,363
They call themselves the Council
and they're scary dudes,

584
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:14,838
very high up on the evil food chain.

585
00:38:15,009 --> 00:38:16,408
It's only gonna be a matter of time

586
00:38:16,569 --> 00:38:18,321
before they send somebody
looking for you.

587
00:38:18,489 --> 00:38:21,720
Means we're doing something right
if we're getting their attention.

588
00:38:21,889 --> 00:38:24,357
Plus it means that there's some
method to this Wiccan madness,

589
00:38:24,529 --> 00:38:26,406
some greater purpose.

590
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:27,638
It's nice to finally know.

591
00:38:27,849 --> 00:38:29,441
Be careful what you wish for.

592
00:38:29,649 --> 00:38:33,198
Oh, I am a reformed wishaholic,
believe me.

593
00:38:33,369 --> 00:38:35,360
I'm in no hurry
to get any new powers.

594
00:38:35,529 --> 00:38:38,521
Besides, the power you already have
is the one that saved the day anyway.

595
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:40,321
I know and I love it.

596
00:38:40,529 --> 00:38:43,089
I do. I just have to work on
controlling it better.

597
00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:45,365
Yeah, and I'm gonna concentrate
on finding Mr. Right,

598
00:38:45,529 --> 00:38:48,885
not settling for Dick.

599
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:55,880
Well, speaking of wishes,
you still got two left, you know.

600
00:38:56,049 --> 00:38:58,244
Yes, we know, and we already know
what one of them is.

601
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:00,127
If you're up for it, that is.

602
00:39:01,769 --> 00:39:03,407
We want to make you mortal.

603
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:06,567
Keep you off of the Council's radar,
once and for all.

604
00:39:06,769 --> 00:39:09,567
True freedom.
And not just from the bottle.

605
00:39:09,729 --> 00:39:12,004
Although, mortality
is the consequence.

606
00:39:12,209 --> 00:39:14,404
And feelings too.

607
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:16,440
Even the painful ones.

608
00:39:16,649 --> 00:39:20,608
That's okay. I think I'm ready.
Feeling pretty sensitive these days.

609
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:23,882
Let me ask you something.
Why would you do that for me?

610
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:26,643
I mean, especially after
I helped kill you.

611
00:39:26,809 --> 00:39:28,959
Yeah, well, you also helped
bring me back.

612
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:31,245
And besides, once you're human,

613
00:39:31,409 --> 00:39:34,162
we don't have to worry
about you tricking us again.

614
00:39:34,969 --> 00:39:37,244
But there's one wish
you have to grant first.

615
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,644
One that I need.

616
00:39:39,809 --> 00:39:41,083
I want Dan to have peace of mind,

617
00:39:41,249 --> 00:39:44,480
to forget about all the horrible things
that happened the past couple of days,

618
00:39:44,649 --> 00:39:47,209
about who we all really are.

619
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:50,999
I wish that Dan could
truly move on with his life,

620
00:39:51,169 --> 00:39:53,125
without consequences.

621
00:39:55,729 --> 00:39:59,768
Your wish is my command.

622
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,761
No tricks, right?

623
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:26,489
No tricks. I promise.

624
00:40:26,849 --> 00:40:29,158
Got no powers.

625
00:40:35,249 --> 00:40:37,604
Well, that was an interesting
couple of days.

626
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,805
Interesting couple of years.

627
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:43,685
They're calling me, I gotta go.

628
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,601
Not so fast.

629
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:47,282
If we're ever gonna
make this work,

630
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:50,919
I think I deserve to know a little bit
more about you, don't you think?

631
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:54,126
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm going with you, Leo.

632
00:40:55,609 --> 00:40:57,281
I'd like to meet them.

633
00:40:58,169 --> 00:40:59,727
Are you sure?

634
00:40:59,889 --> 00:41:03,564
Positive. Take me to your leader.

635
00:41:04,769 --> 00:41:06,407
Piper?

636
00:41:06,609 --> 00:41:08,565
What are you...? What...?

637
00:41:08,809 --> 00:41:10,527
Don't worry, I'll be back.

638
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:19,560
Worry? I'm not worried.

639
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:21,401
I mean, of course
she'll be back, right?

640
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:23,520
Of course.
I mean, why would we worry?
