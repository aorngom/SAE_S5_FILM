0
00:00:19,369 --> 00:00:21,803
- What's with the hide-and-go-peek?
- He's still staring at me.

1
00:00:21,969 --> 00:00:25,041
- Who?
- That guy at the end of the bar.

2
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:27,725
Oh, no, honey, that's not staring.
That's flirting.

3
00:00:27,929 --> 00:00:30,841
- You say tomato...
- No, I say relax-o.

4
00:00:32,329 --> 00:00:35,207
He seems pretty harmless.
I mean, he's clean-cut, innocent.

5
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:38,162
The kind of guy that a girl
could teach a few things to.

6
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,763
Hello, kind of girl
who's in a serious relationship.

7
00:00:40,929 --> 00:00:42,681
Besides, it's always
the innocent-Iooking ones

8
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:44,208
you have to watch out for.

9
00:00:46,809 --> 00:00:49,960
Hi. Hey, all right,
I need some professional help.

10
00:00:50,169 --> 00:00:53,559
- No arguments here.
- Cute. Where is your DJ?

11
00:00:53,769 --> 00:00:55,600
He's on break. Why?
What's going on?

12
00:00:55,809 --> 00:00:57,640
You know when you get a song
stuck in your head,

13
00:00:57,809 --> 00:00:58,924
and you can't get it out?

14
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:02,439
Yeah, I couldn't get the Facts of Life
song out of my head for three years.

15
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:04,765
All right. I have absolutely
no idea what this one is,

16
00:01:04,969 --> 00:01:07,119
and it's driving me crazy.
I thought maybe your DJ

17
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:09,320
- would recognise it or something.
- How's it go?

18
00:01:09,889 --> 00:01:12,847
- I'm not gonna sing it for you.
- Why not? Maybe we'll recognize it.

19
00:01:14,129 --> 00:01:15,118
Okay.

20
00:01:20,209 --> 00:01:21,608
- Anything?
- Nada.

21
00:01:22,169 --> 00:01:24,603
I'm thinking if you tried it again
with a little more oomph,

22
00:01:24,809 --> 00:01:27,164
maybe some choreography,
and Piper could back you up

23
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:28,563
with some old-school beatbox.

24
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:32,201
Why did I know I would get absolutely
no help out of you crazy people?

25
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:35,006
Oh, come on, wait a minute.

26
00:01:35,209 --> 00:01:38,838
Wait. We can't let you leave
completely empty-handed.

27
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:40,764
What is this?

28
00:01:40,969 --> 00:01:42,721
You really reconnected
with our friend Justin.

29
00:01:42,929 --> 00:01:45,966
He's inviting us to his big annual
family barbecue.

30
00:01:46,169 --> 00:01:47,522
Sounds like fun.

31
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,720
For who? I mean, you know,
Justin and I

32
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:52,523
are still in the flirtatious banter
stage of the relationship.

33
00:01:52,729 --> 00:01:55,118
I think hanging out with the folks
might put a damper on it.

34
00:01:55,329 --> 00:01:57,320
- Is that all?
- Yeah, what do you mean?

35
00:01:57,529 --> 00:02:01,204
I mean, are you sure it's not because
it's a big family gathering?

36
00:02:01,409 --> 00:02:03,718
If you're gonna go with the
"Prue's got parental issues" card,

37
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:04,964
let me save you some time.

38
00:02:05,169 --> 00:02:08,559
Prue, it's not like we blame you.
Seeing complete, connected families

39
00:02:08,769 --> 00:02:12,523
is hard on all of us. We can't spend
our lives avoiding what bothers us.

40
00:02:12,729 --> 00:02:14,321
The only thing bothering me
right now

41
00:02:14,529 --> 00:02:16,679
is that I cannot get this stupid song
out of my head.

42
00:02:16,889 --> 00:02:18,208
I really appreciate your concern.

43
00:02:18,409 --> 00:02:19,922
You know what I would
appreciate more?

44
00:02:20,129 --> 00:02:22,120
Five minutes with your DJ.

45
00:02:38,169 --> 00:02:40,444
Would you like some ice cream,
little one?

46
00:02:40,929 --> 00:02:41,998
Yeah.

47
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:45,838
You didn't say please.

48
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:42,408
Help me!

49
00:05:18,289 --> 00:05:19,324
Come on, Cole, talk to me.

50
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:22,561
Morning, sunshine.

51
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:27,758
Okay, how about cloudy
with chance of showers?

52
00:05:27,969 --> 00:05:30,119
I'm sorry, did you say something?

53
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:32,240
Nothing pressing.
You pull an all-nighter again?

54
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,963
Yeah. Subject matter's
been elusive.

55
00:05:37,209 --> 00:05:39,165
Caught by the bell.
Who's the instant message from?

56
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:41,200
Oh, it's nothing.

57
00:05:41,489 --> 00:05:43,639
All right, well, nothing
usually means something,

58
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:46,164
and something
usually means a boy, so...

59
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:48,679
All right, I don't know what you guys
are talking about,

60
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:51,244
but what I've got is better,
at least bizarrer.

61
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:53,519
Bizarrer? Is that even a word, Piper?

62
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:55,685
Whatever. Anyway,
Cara called last night.

63
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:58,039
She had a meeting
in the Bay Tech Building yesterday,

64
00:05:58,249 --> 00:06:00,809
and she swore that she saw Victor
walking through the lobby.

65
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,203
As in Dad Victor?

66
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:04,206
As in we haven't spoken to him
in a year

67
00:06:04,409 --> 00:06:06,764
and he's probably in town
and he hasn't bothered to call us.

68
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:08,880
That would be the one.
You see my need to share?

69
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:10,761
But Cara hasn't seen him
since what?

70
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:13,642
Like the first grade, I know.
But she sounded very sure.

71
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:16,722
Why do you think he's here?
Should we go and try and find him?

72
00:06:17,889 --> 00:06:19,720
What if it has nothing to do with us?

73
00:06:19,929 --> 00:06:22,159
Well, I for one am not gonna
go out of my way to find out.

74
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:24,644
Wait, you're not even curious?

75
00:06:24,849 --> 00:06:26,840
Come on, Prue.
I mean, he is our father.

76
00:06:27,049 --> 00:06:30,166
Like I said before, I've come to terms
with our lack of parental involvement.

77
00:06:30,369 --> 00:06:32,519
Some people weren't meant to have
the Rockwellian porch

78
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,118
with the house, the two-car garage,
the golden retriever

79
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,398
and the doting mom and dad.

80
00:06:36,609 --> 00:06:40,363
Okay, so we're not the typical family.
But he is all we have, Prue.

81
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:42,686
No, Piper, we have each other,

82
00:06:43,049 --> 00:06:46,280
okay. And we have other people that
love us, and very full and busy lives.

83
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,763
Speaking of which, I gotta dash.

84
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:51,041
If you wanna have lunch,
I'll be up on Knob Hill in the park for...

85
00:06:51,249 --> 00:06:52,887
- Doing a shoot, okay?
- Okay.

86
00:06:53,089 --> 00:06:54,807
Okay.

87
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:58,718
- Hey, can I walk you out?
- That would be so nice.

88
00:07:38,369 --> 00:07:39,563
Oh, excuse me.

89
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:04,079
Hi. I'm...

90
00:08:04,289 --> 00:08:05,881
You don't really care
who I am, do you?

91
00:08:06,089 --> 00:08:07,727
I mean, everybody else
is on lunch break

92
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:09,726
and you're stuck here
fielding random questions

93
00:08:09,929 --> 00:08:12,523
from people who shouldn't even
be asking them in the first place...

94
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:14,048
Can I actually help you?

95
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,366
Yeah. Right.

96
00:08:16,569 --> 00:08:19,845
I'd like to know which company
Victor Bennett is with.

97
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,723
- He's not.
- Excuse me?

98
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:26,528
Bennett comma Victor?

99
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:28,720
He's not listed
in any office in the building.

100
00:08:28,929 --> 00:08:32,604
I have a picture.
It's about from a decade ago,

101
00:08:33,489 --> 00:08:35,286
but have you seen him around?

102
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:38,687
Are you sure?
Because I know that...

103
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,247
Dad?

104
00:08:44,569 --> 00:08:46,321
Dad.

105
00:08:46,969 --> 00:08:48,084
- What?
- It's...

106
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:51,926
It's not you. I'm sorry,
I thought you were...

107
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:54,042
I'm sorry.

108
00:08:59,689 --> 00:09:01,759
So they say stick to what you know,

109
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:05,041
so I pitched a piece
about growing up in the city.

110
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:07,604
- Hopefully it'll make the cover.
- You're dodging.

111
00:09:08,609 --> 00:09:09,962
Artfully, but it's still a dodge.

112
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:13,241
All right, did you ever consider
that maybe I just don't wanna go?

113
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:15,041
No, it has nothing to do
with the barbecue

114
00:09:15,249 --> 00:09:17,319
or the guy that asked you
to go with him.

115
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:18,918
It has to do with Dad.

116
00:09:20,489 --> 00:09:23,765
Why do you insist on pinning
everything that I do on my feelings

117
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:25,800
or lack thereof for our father?

118
00:09:26,009 --> 00:09:28,842
Prue, you say you're over it,
but you say it so much

119
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:32,240
that I have this feeling that the person
you're trying to convince is yourself.

120
00:09:33,169 --> 00:09:35,729
And believe me,
after what I went through with Cole,

121
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:37,408
if anyone understands that, it's me.

122
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,723
- It's sort of not the same thing.
- Well, maybe it is.

123
00:09:40,929 --> 00:09:42,681
My feelings for our father
are in the past,

124
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:45,039
which means they really
have no place in the present.

125
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:47,843
So Justin gets penalized.

126
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:53,008
- There it is.
- What?

127
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:55,439
That song. Don't you hear it?
Somebody's humming it.

128
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:05,161
Hi.

129
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:07,488
Hey.

130
00:10:07,689 --> 00:10:10,601
I was wondering if you could tell me
what that song is that you're humming.

131
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,165
Okay, riddle solved. Now you can stop
humming that stupid song.

132
00:10:23,009 --> 00:10:25,364
We were in the middle of you
trying to make an argument

133
00:10:25,569 --> 00:10:28,037
of why you're not gonna go
to Justin's barbecue.

134
00:10:29,529 --> 00:10:32,601
Prue, if you keep ignoring me,
my feelings might actually implode.

135
00:10:38,369 --> 00:10:41,406
- It's cold out.
- There's a thing we call winter here.

136
00:10:41,609 --> 00:10:44,646
Why would a child want ice cream
when it's this cold out?

137
00:10:44,849 --> 00:10:47,966
And the truck pulled up
and no one budged.

138
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,807
And did you notice
there are no parents?

139
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:51,601
So connect the dots for me, please?

140
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,037
Preferably standing still.

141
00:10:53,249 --> 00:10:55,763
What? Do you have
a hankering for a snow cone?

142
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,846
Prue, we're in the middle
of a conversation,

143
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:01,041
and considering your lunch hour
ended, oh, five minutes ago

144
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:03,968
- we should probably make this fast.
- Yeah, well, something's wrong.

145
00:11:04,169 --> 00:11:06,125
I know that. Why don't you
talk to me about it?

146
00:11:06,329 --> 00:11:08,684
Not with me, Phoebe.
With this, all right?

147
00:11:08,889 --> 00:11:10,368
I have a total déja vu
coming on.

148
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,241
Okay, so first you're humming
weird songs,

149
00:11:12,449 --> 00:11:14,485
and now you're having flashbacks?

150
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:20,763
- Hello?
- Would you like some ice cream?

151
00:11:20,969 --> 00:11:24,882
All right. I mean, it's just that usually
that my instincts...

152
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:28,845
No! Hold on!

153
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:53,282
All right, where's the little girl?

154
00:11:53,489 --> 00:11:55,957
I don't know. I was holding on to her
and... We have to find her.

155
00:11:56,169 --> 00:11:58,125
First, we have to figure out
where the hell we are.

156
00:11:58,329 --> 00:12:01,241
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say
we're not still in the ice-cream truck.

157
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:05,522
Or even worse, we are
still in the ice-cream truck.

158
00:12:05,729 --> 00:12:07,401
Prue...

159
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:09,918
I know, I hear it too.

160
00:12:13,009 --> 00:12:16,285
All right, if there's a way in,
there's definitely a way out.

161
00:12:16,489 --> 00:12:17,922
Who are you?!

162
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:19,638
No powers, no powers.

163
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:21,282
I'm not surprised,
I'm not surprised.

164
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,759
Okay, something tells me
he was not running from us.

165
00:12:35,969 --> 00:12:37,607
Okay, let's go.

166
00:12:38,209 --> 00:12:39,688
Help!

167
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:41,437
Please help me!

168
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:43,998
Help you from what?

169
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:48,887
- The Nothing.
- Was that the man we just saw here?

170
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:50,767
It's up there.

171
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:53,358
It comes for you, for everybody.

172
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:58,006
And when it gets you, the only thing
left where you stood is nothing.

173
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:01,724
You never know when it's coming.
And you never know who it wants.

174
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:05,082
We try to hide,
but it keeps finding us.

175
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:08,164
Hurry! It's coming!

176
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:11,247
In here! Come on!

177
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:13,207
Here, in here!

178
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:15,518
Wait for me!

179
00:13:17,329 --> 00:13:19,285
- Run!
- Help!

180
00:13:19,489 --> 00:13:21,161
She's not gonna make it.

181
00:13:22,609 --> 00:13:23,598
Prue!

182
00:13:26,329 --> 00:13:27,967
Come on.

183
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:38,763
She was right there.

184
00:13:38,969 --> 00:13:42,166
Prue, it's not your fault. Our powers
don't work here, we know that now.

185
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:43,722
We'll be better prepared next time.

186
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:47,122
Does that mean
you're gonna save us?

187
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:50,479
- Us?
- There are others just like me.

188
00:13:50,969 --> 00:13:53,767
Hiding. Captured by
the ice-cream man.

189
00:13:55,489 --> 00:13:57,161
If he doesn't want you here,

190
00:13:57,369 --> 00:14:00,088
that must mean that you
have the power to save us.

191
00:14:01,329 --> 00:14:03,320
We should go.

192
00:14:03,889 --> 00:14:06,039
The Nothing will be coming back.

193
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:09,480
It always does. Come on.

194
00:14:11,009 --> 00:14:13,443
Prue, it's me leaving you
another message

195
00:14:13,649 --> 00:14:15,446
after leaving Phoebe
another message.

196
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:18,527
I tried you at work, but they said you
never checked in after your shoot.

197
00:14:18,729 --> 00:14:20,640
So where are you guys?

198
00:14:22,649 --> 00:14:25,766
Look, so call me. Or better yet,
just show up and save me

199
00:14:25,969 --> 00:14:29,757
from having to perform an impending
awkward rejection all by myself.

200
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:33,040
Hi, I'm Caleb.

201
00:14:33,489 --> 00:14:34,558
Piper.

202
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:37,442
I'm sort of new in town
and I'm looking to meet someone.

203
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:40,244
Someone special?

204
00:14:41,929 --> 00:14:45,046
Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt
your phone call to your...

205
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:48,878
Fiancé. Very large,
very jealous fiancé.

206
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:52,559
Really? Does...?
Does he ever come here?

207
00:14:52,769 --> 00:14:56,045
- Yeah, all the time.
- So he lives nearby?

208
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:01,002
Look, I'm flattered. And you know,
if this was another time or place...

209
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:03,404
Maybe you'd like to meet
one of my single sisters?

210
00:15:03,609 --> 00:15:05,759
You've got sisters? Really?

211
00:15:05,969 --> 00:15:08,358
Well, maybe we could all
get together some time.

212
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:14,168
Does...? Does your fiancé like
to hang out with your sisters too?

213
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:18,999
Okay. You know what? I don't know
what kind of kinky stuff you're into,

214
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,848
but there's a club down the street
you might be more comfortable in.

215
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:25,758
They've got cages and rubber floors,
and a three-for-two special on Fridays.

216
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:29,006
- I'm not looking for a club, Piper.
- And I'm not interested, Caleb.

217
00:15:29,209 --> 00:15:31,245
At least not in what I think
you're interested in.

218
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,759
So if you don't mind, I have lots
of stacking and stuff to do.

219
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:37,844
I think you got the wrong...
Oh, okay. l...

220
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:40,722
You know what, I'm gonna come
back later, when you're not...

221
00:15:40,929 --> 00:15:41,918
...stacking.

222
00:15:47,689 --> 00:15:51,125
Prue, where are you guys?

223
00:15:52,969 --> 00:15:55,847
Are we going in circles? This looks
like the exact same playground.

224
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,563
In this place, everywhere you go
looks the same.

225
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:03,240
That's how the Nothing gets you.
Only a few of us can find our way.

226
00:16:05,329 --> 00:16:08,048
Why couldn't you get a boy-band song
in your head like everybody else?

227
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:12,760
All right, just tell us everything
you know about the ice-cream man.

228
00:16:12,969 --> 00:16:15,199
Just that he's the one
who put us here.

229
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:19,527
All right, so is he
in charge of the Nothing?

230
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,084
I don't know, I guess.

231
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,325
The others are gonna be
so happy to see you.

232
00:16:24,529 --> 00:16:26,485
We've been wishing
and hoping that someday,

233
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:30,284
someone would come
and save us. And now you're here.

234
00:16:30,849 --> 00:16:33,443
Well, we're gonna do whatever
we can to get you out of here.

235
00:16:33,649 --> 00:16:35,480
So why don't you take us
to your friends?

236
00:16:35,689 --> 00:16:37,441
Through here.

237
00:16:38,849 --> 00:16:40,248
Daddy!

238
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:45,443
It's okay. It's all right. It's okay.

239
00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:50,167
What is it?

240
00:16:51,289 --> 00:16:53,962
I saw you, when you were little,

241
00:16:54,169 --> 00:16:56,399
in this playground with Dad.

242
00:17:06,969 --> 00:17:08,641
Leo?

243
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:11,400
Leo?

244
00:17:16,929 --> 00:17:19,238
- It's about time.
- Piper, I was busy.

245
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:21,958
Well, don't you have orb waiting?

246
00:17:22,169 --> 00:17:24,967
Look, it's not fair to my other clients
if I keep getting calls from you

247
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:26,284
while I'm at work.

248
00:17:26,649 --> 00:17:28,924
Look, I just have one teensy favour.

249
00:17:29,129 --> 00:17:31,085
Prue and Phoebe
never came back from lunch

250
00:17:31,289 --> 00:17:33,325
and they haven't been returning
my phone calls.

251
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,201
And I know I'm probably
just being paranoid,

252
00:17:35,409 --> 00:17:39,118
but can't you do that check-the-
supernatural-radar thing that you do?

253
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:41,206
I'm sure it's fine, they're just...

254
00:17:47,849 --> 00:17:48,838
Leo?

255
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,485
- Not good?
- I can't sense them anywhere.

256
00:17:53,689 --> 00:17:55,122
It's like they just...

257
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,364
Disappeared.

258
00:17:59,449 --> 00:18:02,566
- All right, is that all of you?
- All that's left.

259
00:18:02,769 --> 00:18:03,918
Are you gonna save us?

260
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:05,357
We're gonna try.

261
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:08,879
All right, I think the only way out
is to go through the person that...

262
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,122
Put us here in the first place.

263
00:18:12,329 --> 00:18:14,763
The ice-cream man? But how
are we supposed to find him?

264
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,641
Something tells me
that's not gonna be hard.

265
00:18:16,849 --> 00:18:19,238
- Why not?
- Oh, because he's right over there.

266
00:18:20,409 --> 00:18:21,842
Okay, you kids stay here.

267
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:25,121
We'll take care
of the Good Humor Man. Let's go.

268
00:18:25,449 --> 00:18:27,087
There he is, by the slide.

269
00:18:29,249 --> 00:18:31,922
Hey wait, look at that.
What does that look like to you?

270
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:33,642
The street,
from the back of the truck.

271
00:18:33,849 --> 00:18:35,043
That's right, the way out.

272
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,205
Okay, all that we need now
are the...

273
00:18:38,769 --> 00:18:41,203
Hey, we were just coming to get you.
Come on, we're going home.

274
00:18:43,809 --> 00:18:46,642
Come on, come on. One down.

275
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:50,761
Here comes another one.

276
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:54,004
- No!
- Hurry, get!

277
00:18:55,729 --> 00:18:57,128
Okay, I'm going next.

278
00:18:57,329 --> 00:18:59,604
- Okay, go.
- Keep away from the door!

279
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,128
Ari, come on. Hurry up.

280
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:22,766
- Oh, my God.
- Actually, quite the opposite.

281
00:19:23,209 --> 00:19:25,848
Okay, we need to keep him away
from the other kids.

282
00:19:26,009 --> 00:19:29,126
I don't think they'll listen to you.
You're not the boss of them.

283
00:19:31,969 --> 00:19:33,368
Did you do it?

284
00:19:33,569 --> 00:19:35,287
Say thank you to the witches.

285
00:19:35,489 --> 00:19:36,524
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

286
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:47,558
Why don't we try focusing
on the positive?

287
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,920
- They're together.
- That's it? That's your positive?

288
00:19:51,129 --> 00:19:53,563
Because I've got a list
a mile long in the negative column.

289
00:19:53,769 --> 00:19:56,522
They've been gone all night, Leo.
And not even you can find them.

290
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:59,004
- I'm sure they're fine.
- You don't know that.

291
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:02,042
Any minute they're gonna walk through
that door with a good explanation.

292
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:04,080
Piper?

293
00:20:05,529 --> 00:20:07,008
See?

294
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:09,637
Prue, Phoebe, hi.

295
00:20:09,849 --> 00:20:11,521
Hey.

296
00:20:11,849 --> 00:20:13,999
- Okay.
- Where were we?

297
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:16,040
Oh, I would like to know
the same thing.

298
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:17,807
All that we know
is we have to go back.

299
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,364
Wait a minute, is this demon
or sibling-related?

300
00:20:20,569 --> 00:20:22,958
A little bit of both. We thought
the good guys were bad guys,

301
00:20:23,169 --> 00:20:25,478
and in trying to vanquish them,
we helped the real bad guys,

302
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:27,520
which were dead ringers
for good guys.

303
00:20:27,729 --> 00:20:28,957
Was that English?

304
00:20:29,169 --> 00:20:31,239
How about we fill in the blanks
as we climb the stairs

305
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:34,122
- to that big book in the attic?
- Good idea.

306
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:41,887
So he's a demonic dogcatcher
and he uses ice cream as bait?

307
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:44,205
Great news for the
lactose-intolerant demons.

308
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,162
Nothing in here on the demon kids
who escaped.

309
00:20:47,369 --> 00:20:49,041
That we helped escape.

310
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:51,968
But there's a whole page
dedicated to the Ice Cream Man.

311
00:20:52,169 --> 00:20:53,522
What?

312
00:20:53,729 --> 00:20:56,118
- He is mortal.
- What?

313
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,566
Do you remember when demons
looked like demons

314
00:20:58,769 --> 00:21:02,045
and innocents looked like innocents?
Who changed the rules on us?

315
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:03,967
Wait. If he's mortal,
how does he do it?

316
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:07,319
- It's not him.
- Bingo, it's a song.

317
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,520
It says, "The Ice Cream Man
plays the devil's chord,

318
00:21:09,729 --> 00:21:11,799
which is a series of notes
that when sounded together

319
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:14,284
specifically attract demon kids
like moths to a flame."

320
00:21:14,489 --> 00:21:17,128
More like moths to nothing.
That's what's inside the truck.

321
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,121
Nothing. That why
he pulls them in there.

322
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:22,843
The Nothing is the only thing
that can vanquish them.

323
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,927
So they might be pint-sized,
but they're badasses.

324
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:28,597
But if they couldn't get out
on their own, how did you guys?

325
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:31,007
Because he led us out.

326
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:37,604
- He tried to save us.
- And that is all she wrote, literally.

327
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:42,158
The Nothing doesn't discriminate.
Good or evil, tastes the same.

328
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:45,281
Now the only person who knows
anything about the escaped meanies

329
00:21:45,489 --> 00:21:48,128
is stuck on the playground
and is in serious danger

330
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:49,842
- of becoming lunch himself.
- Right.

331
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,085
And our powers don't play,
not in this situation.

332
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:55,247
Pheebs and I tried everything to get
back in, but the door wouldn't budge.

333
00:21:55,449 --> 00:21:56,848
Well, not everything.

334
00:21:58,809 --> 00:21:59,924
Mind sharing with the room?

335
00:22:01,329 --> 00:22:04,878
Phoebe had a premonition of me...

336
00:22:05,089 --> 00:22:07,080
And Dad in the playground.

337
00:22:07,289 --> 00:22:08,517
You were there?

338
00:22:08,689 --> 00:22:11,681
- How? When?
- Only one way to find out.

339
00:22:11,889 --> 00:22:14,005
Right, but we don't even know
where he is.

340
00:22:14,209 --> 00:22:16,882
Never have, not even now, when
he might actually come in handy.

341
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:21,599
He's here. Dad's in San Francisco.

342
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:24,847
He's been here
for the last three months.

343
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:27,961
So it was him
that your friend Cara saw.

344
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:30,319
And it was an email from him
that I got yesterday

345
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:32,520
that I didn't tell you guys about.

346
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:34,162
He's here.

347
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:36,564
An instant message away.

348
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:38,960
- Phoebe, this is...
- Huge.

349
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:40,522
I know.

350
00:22:40,729 --> 00:22:42,401
And I'm sorry I didn't tell you guys

351
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,924
that I've been keeping in touch
with him, but...

352
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:47,919
I wanted to. It just never
seemed like the right time.

353
00:22:49,769 --> 00:22:52,044
So I guess now it's the right time.

354
00:22:54,529 --> 00:22:56,121
What do you think?

355
00:22:57,049 --> 00:22:58,562
Do we have a choice?

356
00:23:19,929 --> 00:23:21,840
- What you doing?
- Killing.

357
00:23:22,049 --> 00:23:26,008
- No kidding. Did anybody see you?
- Thought I was supposed to kill.

358
00:23:27,249 --> 00:23:30,366
- Was it fun?
- He screamed a lot.

359
00:23:30,569 --> 00:23:32,799
- Cool.
- So, what do we do now?

360
00:23:33,009 --> 00:23:35,762
Well, I guess we waste even more
time while we pick up after you.

361
00:23:35,969 --> 00:23:38,244
But you said all we had to do
was find the truck...

362
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:40,644
Not any truck. The truck.

363
00:23:40,849 --> 00:23:43,921
I already got rid
of the ice-cream man, remember?

364
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:47,804
The only people we might have to kill
to get to the truck are those witches.

365
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,920
- But...
- And if you would've paid attention,

366
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,438
you would've known that.
And you also would've known...

367
00:23:56,089 --> 00:23:58,603
...that this isn't the right truck.

368
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,883
Now, I like killing just as much
as the next demon.

369
00:24:03,089 --> 00:24:06,286
But right now, we gotta be smart.
And trashing every ice-cream truck

370
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:07,922
that we see is not smart.

371
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:11,007
- But it's fun.
- We'll have fun when this is all over.

372
00:24:11,209 --> 00:24:12,688
- Promise?
- Yeah.

373
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:15,722
But first, do you think
you can clean up this mess?

374
00:24:16,209 --> 00:24:17,608
I was waiting for you to say that.

375
00:24:20,689 --> 00:24:21,678
Done.

376
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:23,926
Welcome to Club Switzerland.

377
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:27,007
All right, could we sort of
cut the sarcasm there?

378
00:24:27,209 --> 00:24:29,928
I just didn't feel like inviting him
to our home for tea and cookies.

379
00:24:30,129 --> 00:24:33,201
- He's our father, Prue. This is family.
- This is business.

380
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,400
And don't even think
about giving me that look.

381
00:24:35,609 --> 00:24:37,884
If he gives us any useful information
about the playground,

382
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:40,125
I will be the very first one
to thank him.

383
00:24:40,329 --> 00:24:41,967
And then send him packing.

384
00:24:42,169 --> 00:24:44,808
These must be the sisters
I've heard so much about.

385
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:48,001
- Caleb.
- To think I almost didn't swing by.

386
00:24:48,449 --> 00:24:50,963
Okay, you know what, I've tried.
I really have.

387
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:53,763
And you're not a bad guy.
But obviously the part of your brain

388
00:24:53,969 --> 00:24:56,483
meant to take a hint
wasn't wired together properly,

389
00:24:56,689 --> 00:24:58,327
because you're not taking any.

390
00:24:58,529 --> 00:25:00,326
This is a really bad time.

391
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:02,201
Oh, okay.

392
00:25:02,409 --> 00:25:04,047
When would be a good time?

393
00:25:04,689 --> 00:25:05,678
Help me.

394
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:08,998
You got a phone call.
It's in the office.

395
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:11,279
- Why don't I show you where that is?
- Okay.

396
00:25:11,489 --> 00:25:14,686
- Do you mind if I ask you something?
- Thank you.

397
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:18,278
Hey, you're just lucky
nobody got killed, okay?

398
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:20,367
You hear what I'm saying?

399
00:25:28,249 --> 00:25:29,364
Well.

400
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:32,129
Would it be too much
to ask for a hug?

401
00:25:33,329 --> 00:25:36,048
- It's good to see you, Daddy.
- Oh, baby, you have no idea.

402
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:42,322
What a place. This is yours, Piper?
It's terrific.

403
00:25:42,529 --> 00:25:44,759
The three of you together.
I hardly know where to begin.

404
00:25:45,129 --> 00:25:47,882
Well, I have a suggestion.
How about we just cut to the chase?

405
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:51,409
Prue, he just got here.
Can't that wait, like, five minutes?

406
00:25:51,609 --> 00:25:54,123
He's a businessman, Piper. I'd think
he would appreciate that.

407
00:25:54,329 --> 00:25:57,321
We can do the family-bonding thing
once the work is done, all right?

408
00:25:57,529 --> 00:26:00,282
How about you just tell us everything
you know about the playground?

409
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:02,518
What playground?

410
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,765
Dad, I had a premonition.
I know you were there.

411
00:26:04,969 --> 00:26:07,563
And somebody's hurt,
so we need to get back inside.

412
00:26:09,649 --> 00:26:12,004
- Let it go.
- That may be your motto,

413
00:26:12,209 --> 00:26:14,165
but we made a mistake
and we'd like to fix it.

414
00:26:14,369 --> 00:26:16,883
So just tell us how you got in,
and we can handle it from there.

415
00:26:17,089 --> 00:26:19,523
- We're big witches now.
- Yeah, but you're still my girls.

416
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:21,879
- Victor...
- Prue.

417
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:31,001
All right.

418
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,368
Yes, I was there.

419
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:36,241
I went in after you, and...

420
00:26:37,649 --> 00:26:40,482
It was the last thing I ever did
as your father.

421
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:45,598
You were home with a cold...
Must've been about 6.

422
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:48,767
Your mom had some errands to run,
so she took your sisters with her

423
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:51,119
and left me home in charge.

424
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:54,967
You had asked me
to read you a story.

425
00:26:55,169 --> 00:26:56,887
You used to love that.

426
00:26:57,169 --> 00:26:59,808
But the cold was too much for you.
You only lasted a page or two,

427
00:27:00,009 --> 00:27:02,762
and I left your room.
You were still sleeping.

428
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:05,883
Never heard you come downstairs.

429
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:10,481
You must have been looking
for a glass of water or me.

430
00:27:11,529 --> 00:27:13,804
And that must've been
when you heard it.

431
00:27:17,689 --> 00:27:20,203
- The song.
- I mean, I heard a truck drive by

432
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:22,798
and stop a few doors down,
but I didn't think anything of it.

433
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:25,523
It was an ice-cream truck.
How was I to know?

434
00:27:25,729 --> 00:27:28,323
But somehow you did. You must've
gone into the living room

435
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:29,928
following that song.

436
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:32,279
And that's when you saw it happen.

437
00:27:32,529 --> 00:27:35,282
A little boy, not much older
than yourself.

438
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:37,042
Yeah.

439
00:27:37,249 --> 00:27:40,207
He was standing by the truck
and something pulled him in.

440
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:41,603
He was so scared.

441
00:27:41,809 --> 00:27:43,242
And you ran out to help him.

442
00:27:43,729 --> 00:27:45,162
Just like yesterday.

443
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:47,678
When I saw your bed was empty,
I lost my mind.

444
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:50,968
The door was wide open.
There was a truck parked outside.

445
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,081
I mean, I had no idea what I was
getting into, but I just had to go.

446
00:27:54,289 --> 00:27:56,086
You saved Prue.

447
00:27:56,689 --> 00:27:58,168
But I lost the three of you.

448
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:01,798
You said you left

449
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:05,126
because Grams wanted us
to use our powers, and you didn't.

450
00:28:05,329 --> 00:28:07,797
That's the truth. And now you know
the whole story.

451
00:28:08,009 --> 00:28:10,000
I mean, when your grandmother
found out...

452
00:28:10,209 --> 00:28:11,688
I had just brought Prue back,

453
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:13,481
but being your father
wasn't good enough.

454
00:28:13,689 --> 00:28:16,283
I mean, how could I ever protect you
from something like that again

455
00:28:16,489 --> 00:28:17,683
when I didn't have the powers?

456
00:28:18,689 --> 00:28:22,728
Okay, so the book said
the Ice Cream Man is mortal.

457
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:25,363
That's why he can go through
the door and we can't, right?

458
00:28:27,049 --> 00:28:29,324
So, what do you say, Dad?
We need your help.

459
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:36,645
You know, if this doesn't work,
I can look back

460
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,567
and pinpoint the moment
where it went wrong.

461
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:41,442
And that moment's name
would be Dad?

462
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:44,402
You gotta admit, if he can open
the door, then we kind of need him.

463
00:28:44,609 --> 00:28:46,361
It's all about word choice.
We don't need him,

464
00:28:46,569 --> 00:28:49,003
we need his utter lack of power,
right? He opens the door,

465
00:28:49,209 --> 00:28:51,404
we save the day,
we get on with our lives.

466
00:28:51,609 --> 00:28:52,837
It's a one-time group effort.

467
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:55,968
Glad to see you have a healthy
handle on the situation, Prue.

468
00:28:56,409 --> 00:28:57,762
I think I do.

469
00:28:58,409 --> 00:29:00,365
So yeah, I was surprised
to hear from you.

470
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:02,446
But why did you think
I wouldn't let you back?

471
00:29:02,649 --> 00:29:04,367
Because as far back
as you can remember,

472
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:06,002
I've done very little right by you.

473
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:07,847
I mean, if a guy,
let alone your own dad,

474
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,559
walks out on you once, maybe
you give him a second chance.

475
00:29:10,769 --> 00:29:13,078
But if he appears
to make a habit of it...

476
00:29:13,289 --> 00:29:15,245
I never thought you left
by choice, Dad.

477
00:29:16,889 --> 00:29:18,720
Thank you, Pheeb.

478
00:29:18,929 --> 00:29:21,568
Okay, well, this is it.

479
00:29:21,769 --> 00:29:23,088
But there's nothing here.

480
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:25,041
Wait, we lost the truck?

481
00:29:26,969 --> 00:29:29,802
Yeah, but we gained company.

482
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:39,204
Oh, those kids so need
to be grounded.

483
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:46,361
I don't get it. Why pick a fight
and then run?

484
00:29:46,529 --> 00:29:48,804
Speaking of running, we should run.
They're getting away.

485
00:29:49,009 --> 00:29:51,045
We can't, because we have
to get back in the truck.

486
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:52,238
Not all of us. Come on.

487
00:29:54,729 --> 00:29:56,447
Nice work.

488
00:29:57,849 --> 00:30:00,568
All right, lost modes of transport
are definitely not my forte, so...

489
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:03,159
Prue, sometimes in life,
things happen for a reason.

490
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:07,078
No magic involved.
The truck's been towed.

491
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:11,407
Right.

492
00:30:21,689 --> 00:30:25,648
- Need a hand?
- No, and I don't need anything.

493
00:30:28,809 --> 00:30:32,688
This is where he pulled us in.
But since he's still trapped inside,

494
00:30:32,889 --> 00:30:36,677
I'm guessing the only way in
is through the exit.

495
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:41,718
All right, let's just do this.

496
00:30:43,689 --> 00:30:44,917
You can do it, right?

497
00:30:47,009 --> 00:30:49,842
Well, let's just say
that chasing demons

498
00:30:50,009 --> 00:30:51,840
is not exactly my day job.

499
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:54,847
All right.

500
00:30:55,049 --> 00:30:58,200
It helps if you specifically focus
on the task.

501
00:30:59,289 --> 00:31:02,281
Don't think about what's behind
the door. That will only distract you.

502
00:31:02,489 --> 00:31:05,049
Picture yourself opening the door.

503
00:31:05,249 --> 00:31:08,798
See yourself opening the door.
Then just do it.

504
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:22,879
- Thanks for the advice.
- Just doing my job.

505
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:33,686
This would be a lot easier
if things stopped moving.

506
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:35,117
We left him right here.

507
00:31:36,729 --> 00:31:37,923
Unless...

508
00:31:39,009 --> 00:31:41,477
The Nothing. Even mortals
have memories, Prue.

509
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:44,284
I saw what it did. I know
what it could've done to him.

510
00:31:44,489 --> 00:31:45,683
And us if we don't act quickly.

511
00:31:46,249 --> 00:31:48,285
Yeah, well, at least we agree
upon one thing.

512
00:31:48,569 --> 00:31:52,164
Make that two.
And get out while you still can.

513
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:54,686
Oh, my God.

514
00:31:55,009 --> 00:31:58,604
- I am so sorry. I didn't know.
- No, the mistake was mine.

515
00:31:58,809 --> 00:32:01,960
You're the Charmed Ones.
You were saving innocents.

516
00:32:02,449 --> 00:32:03,962
How could you know they weren't?

517
00:32:04,449 --> 00:32:05,564
How did you know?

518
00:32:05,769 --> 00:32:08,203
Let's just say we both have friends
in high places.

519
00:32:09,249 --> 00:32:12,924
The moment I mistakenly pulled you
and your sister in, I was alerted

520
00:32:13,129 --> 00:32:14,562
and sent to save you.

521
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:17,087
And you get this in return.

522
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:19,684
It's getting closer.

523
00:32:21,129 --> 00:32:23,199
You got us out of here once.
Now it's my turn.

524
00:32:25,849 --> 00:32:28,283
The children... You must get them
back inside the playground.

525
00:32:28,489 --> 00:32:30,286
We will, and you're gonna
help us do it.

526
00:32:30,489 --> 00:32:33,799
I disabled the truck.
You need to fix it. Play the song.

527
00:32:33,969 --> 00:32:36,164
Don't you dare. You stay with us.

528
00:32:36,729 --> 00:32:38,401
Inside...

529
00:32:40,289 --> 00:32:41,404
It's for the truck.

530
00:32:43,249 --> 00:32:45,558
It's almost here. You go first, okay?

531
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:48,283
No. I can be replaced. You can't.

532
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:49,683
No!

533
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:57,167
Prue, it'll be back!
We gotta get out now!

534
00:32:58,049 --> 00:32:59,118
You didn't fail.

535
00:32:59,329 --> 00:33:01,923
The only way you fail is if you don't
go back and do what he asked.

536
00:33:04,249 --> 00:33:05,523
Come on.

537
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:15,248
Why don't they ever run into a well-lit
room with nowhere to hide?

538
00:33:15,449 --> 00:33:17,201
Well, we know they're somewhere.

539
00:33:17,409 --> 00:33:19,206
And I know what's gonna
give them away.

540
00:33:19,409 --> 00:33:21,365
How could you...?

541
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:26,407
How bad did you wanna
get off that playground?

542
00:33:26,609 --> 00:33:28,520
And now we're free.

543
00:33:28,729 --> 00:33:31,243
Don't you wanna stay free?

544
00:33:31,849 --> 00:33:33,726
Why do I get the feeling
they weren't looking

545
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:34,918
to pick a fight?

546
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:38,326
They were just looking for the truck,
and we crashed their party.

547
00:33:38,529 --> 00:33:41,168
But we're like a mile ahead.
I mean, we know where it is.

548
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:42,438
It's in the junkyard.

549
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:45,684
Did I say a mile?

550
00:33:45,889 --> 00:33:48,164
Okay, so they know. It's three
of us versus three of them.

551
00:33:48,369 --> 00:33:50,246
We're even, and bigger.

552
00:33:52,649 --> 00:33:54,048
I think you need to count again.

553
00:33:55,729 --> 00:33:57,845
- When in doubt...
- Bring reinforcements.

554
00:33:58,049 --> 00:34:01,485
All that's left for us to do
is destroy the truck.

555
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:03,168
Yeah.

556
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:06,521
- Prue.
- And Dad. Let's go.

557
00:34:13,689 --> 00:34:16,249
- Do you think they're here already?
- Probably.

558
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,167
Do you think they know
we're here already?

559
00:34:18,369 --> 00:34:19,961
Probably.

560
00:34:21,209 --> 00:34:25,327
Okay, do they do that because they
think it's funny, or just to freak us out?

561
00:34:25,529 --> 00:34:28,407
All we have to do is hold off the
demons until Dad and Prue get out.

562
00:34:28,609 --> 00:34:30,600
You haven't, by any chance,
had a premonition

563
00:34:30,809 --> 00:34:34,199
that this is all gonna turn out okay
and just neglected to inform your kin?

564
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,760
Okay, I think they're surrounding us.

565
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:42,644
Don't say that. We're not surrounded
until they're all around us.

566
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,607
Okay, how bad could the odds be?

567
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:50,598
I mean, sure, there's a whole bunch
of them, but we're witches, right?

568
00:34:50,809 --> 00:34:52,640
And you have the power of...

569
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:54,558
Piper.

570
00:35:05,449 --> 00:35:07,280
All right, you little brats.

571
00:35:07,489 --> 00:35:09,161
Bring it on!

572
00:35:11,049 --> 00:35:14,439
Head for the slide up at the top.
That's our way out.

573
00:35:18,729 --> 00:35:20,845
- Daddy!
- Hold on, Prue!

574
00:35:21,689 --> 00:35:23,042
Daddy! I need you.

575
00:35:23,249 --> 00:35:24,967
I've got you.
I'm not leaving without you.

576
00:35:27,289 --> 00:35:28,722
Dad!

577
00:35:33,889 --> 00:35:35,163
I got you!

578
00:36:11,089 --> 00:36:12,966
All right, any ideas
what to do with this?

579
00:36:13,169 --> 00:36:15,399
Eight years of fixing your
mother's car has given me one.

580
00:36:15,609 --> 00:36:17,088
All right, we'll buy you some time.

581
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:20,247
- Hey, need a hand?
- I need about ten.

582
00:36:21,449 --> 00:36:23,041
Oh, you need a little time-out, missy.

583
00:36:33,529 --> 00:36:35,759
Dad, hurry!

584
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,123
Welcome to our world, Dad.

585
00:37:29,329 --> 00:37:32,924
When I decide I wanna have kids,
you remind me of this day.

586
00:37:34,329 --> 00:37:37,366
Leo, what are you doing here?
Why did you bring him here?

587
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,402
He's supposed to be here, Piper.

588
00:37:39,609 --> 00:37:41,327
You fixed my wheels. Thanks.

589
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,926
Caleb's the new Ice Cream Man.
He filled me in back at the club.

590
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:47,040
Everything's happened
the way it was meant to.

591
00:37:47,249 --> 00:37:49,524
He was sent here to take over.
It's his time.

592
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,447
So your interest in me...

593
00:37:51,649 --> 00:37:53,719
Strictly professional. I was lost.

594
00:37:53,929 --> 00:37:56,602
But until I was sure who you
were, I couldn't just come out

595
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:58,527
and say, "Hey, are you
a Charmed One?

596
00:37:58,729 --> 00:38:01,641
Because I need you to take me
to my demon-catching truck."

597
00:38:02,369 --> 00:38:04,678
Speaking of which,
I'm running kind of late as it is,

598
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:08,120
so thank you, all of you.

599
00:38:10,009 --> 00:38:11,567
Good luck.

600
00:38:16,449 --> 00:38:20,488
Something tells me I'm never gonna
look at a Creamsicle the same way.

601
00:38:32,049 --> 00:38:34,517
Well, I guess this is goodbye again.

602
00:38:39,649 --> 00:38:41,958
Thanks, Dad. Keep writing.

603
00:38:42,169 --> 00:38:43,761
You don't have to keep
secrets anymore.

604
00:38:43,969 --> 00:38:46,403
- I know.
- I mean anything.

605
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:53,401
Hey, what's the story
with this Leo character, anyway?

606
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:55,042
How much does he know
about you?

607
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:56,841
Just about everything.

608
00:38:57,049 --> 00:38:59,324
- So he's...
- He's a wonderful man, yes.

609
00:38:59,529 --> 00:39:01,804
Still, I think I'll have a little chat
with him sometime...

610
00:39:02,169 --> 00:39:04,046
- Dad.
- It's a father's prerogative.

611
00:39:05,489 --> 00:39:08,526
- I'm not saying goodbye.
- Prue.

612
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:11,084
I'm saying see you soon, Dad.

613
00:39:11,889 --> 00:39:12,878
Thank you.

614
00:39:14,689 --> 00:39:17,487
You know, that's sort of why
I came to town.

615
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:19,884
For this job interview. And...

616
00:39:20,409 --> 00:39:24,721
Although it would entail some travel,
I'd be based here in San Francisco.

617
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,408
And...

618
00:39:26,609 --> 00:39:29,328
If you guys think occasionally this
town is big enough for us,

619
00:39:29,529 --> 00:39:30,882
I'd like to accept their offer.

620
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:36,364
- Could I accept that as a yes?
- Yes.

621
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:39,246
That's my cab.

622
00:39:41,729 --> 00:39:43,401
All right.

623
00:39:45,769 --> 00:39:47,725
We've got so much
catching up to do.

624
00:39:47,929 --> 00:39:49,806
That's okay. It's different now.

625
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,641
It is, isn't it?

626
00:39:56,329 --> 00:39:58,047
See you soon.
