1
00:00:00,918 --> 00:00:03,670
So the wizard didn't realise
the weight of the book.

2
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:06,381
And after he put them on the shelves,

3
00:00:06,548 --> 00:00:11,386
they blew up and he had to re-conjure
the entire library magically.

4
00:00:11,553 --> 00:00:14,723
Because he was a wizard,
it only took him a couple of minutes.

5
00:00:15,682 --> 00:00:17,267
Yeah, it's a cute story.

6
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,811
The first couple
thousand times you tell it.

7
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,855
- Excuse me?
- Nothing.

8
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:24,525
That's pretty much the bulk of the tour.

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:28,654
Would you like to know anything about
the facilities, students, teachers?

10
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,743
Boy!

11
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:37,788
That was swinging!

12
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,873
- Hi.
- Hi.

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,416
This is Professor Drake.

14
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:44,378
This is April, one of the students
who's applying.

15
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,339
Oh, salutations.
How do you do? Hello.

16
00:00:47,506 --> 00:00:51,093
Drake is our visiting lecturer
on advanced magical compositions.

17
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,054
In this case,
magical musical compositions.

18
00:00:54,221 --> 00:00:59,017
That's the use of meter and tempo
in spell casting and conjuring.

19
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:05,065
The troll is here.
Why don't we see if he'll dance for us.

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,026
Come on.

21
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:13,740
Hey, you put them down!
All of 'em.

22
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:17,578
- Wow, will I get to take his class?
- Sure, why not?

23
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:22,291
Yeah, actually, Professor Drake's
gonna be on sabbatical in about a week.

24
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:26,378
That's right.
I forgot about that little wrinkle.

25
00:01:26,545 --> 00:01:29,047
But with eager minds,
and the power of magic,

26
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:31,717
it's midsummer madness all the time.

27
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:35,095
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta cut in.

28
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:09,273
They'll burn! They'll burn!

29
00:03:11,108 --> 00:03:15,404
Don't you understand? They'll burn.
We have to help them!

30
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,323
I don't want to hurt anybody.

31
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:21,326
We have to help them!
They're burning...

32
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:24,621
I don't wanna hurt nobody,
but I need somebody to listen!

33
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:26,331
We need help!

34
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:34,006
You don't understand.
You don't understand. The fire...

35
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:36,717
Relax, pal, you're under arrest.

36
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:39,970
Get up!

37
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,556
- We gotta help Marie!
- Just calm down, buddy.

38
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,684
- Come on, everything's gonna be okay.
- No, it won't.

39
00:03:45,851 --> 00:03:49,771
You don't understand! The fire!
You have to let me go so I can get help!

40
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,441
They're gonna burn!
They're gonna burn!

41
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:56,653
Let me out!

42
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:02,492
- Rain gear for the kids?
- Yes.

43
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:05,996
- Camera and film?
- Of course.

44
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:10,709
Extra room for my... pattini?

45
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:13,879
Pattini?

46
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,672
Shoes.

47
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:20,219
It's not a vacation in Italia
if you don't have new shoes.

48
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:22,054
Right.

49
00:04:22,221 --> 00:04:24,765
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

50
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,892
I still don't think this is a good idea.

51
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,937
Why not? In Hong Kong
we'll buy you some suits

52
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,147
or bootleg DVDs or something.

53
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:37,069
It's not the shopping.
It's this whole world vacation thing.

54
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:40,948
I think we should stay here
and wait for the Elders' decision on me.

55
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,201
Absolutely not.
That's precisely why we should be going.

56
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:47,454
We're all together,
we deserve a vacation.

57
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:50,415
We're not gonna wait
for the other pattini to drop.

58
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:54,127
- So that's that. We're going.
- What about the travel and the cost?

59
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,965
For God sakes, we're orbing!

60
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,968
Okay, well...
What about Phoebe and Paige?

61
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,303
- What about them?
- They made us this big

62
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,391
- send-off dinner last night.
- Oh, please! They ordered pizza.

63
00:05:07,558 --> 00:05:09,768
And we're not helping with the clean up.

64
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:13,397
Wow, if that's the best you got,
you really do need a vacation.

65
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:15,858
But...

66
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:19,319
Look, Phoebe and Paige
just remade the world.

67
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,989
I think they can handle the kitchen.

68
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,784
Now, unless you have
any more objections...

69
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:32,416
Leaning Tower of Pisa, here we come!

70
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:38,463
I know, but Elise, why can't
we just do the interview here?

71
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,216
You know, kind of like
a Ask Phoebe at home thing?

72
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,635
Yeah, the place looks great.

73
00:05:43,802 --> 00:05:45,888
Yeah, call him, I'll hold on.

74
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,724
That sounds exciting.

75
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,268
- I guess.
- What do you mean?

76
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:54,980
You have Cosmo profiling you.
That'd be great anytime.

77
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,858
I know, but I still want
to make the most out of my day.

78
00:05:58,609 --> 00:06:01,862
Phoebe, you asked to meet me here at...

79
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,990
...8.22. That's not making
the most of your day,

80
00:06:05,157 --> 00:06:09,328
that's some sort of weird OCD thing.
What's going on?

81
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,330
I don't know.

82
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:14,625
Meeting Drake and realising
what little time he has left

83
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,377
has made me wanna make
the most of the time I have.

84
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:20,297
- You know, time's a'wastin'.
- Yeah.

85
00:06:20,464 --> 00:06:23,926
Well, at least you're not wasting
all your time at Magic School.

86
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:30,140
Yeah, Elise, I'm still here.
They can move it, that's perfect.

87
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:32,434
Okay, as long as
the shoot's over by 3.00,

88
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:36,813
'cause I'm speaking at City College.
All right, I'll be there in 25 minutes.

89
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:39,733
- You're a machine.
- Every moment counts.

90
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,528
Do me a favour and help
get this place cleaned by 2.00?

91
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,279
Great, thanks!

92
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,741
- How you doing? Gotta go.
- Wait. Hold on. I need...

93
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:51,453
- I need your help. Hi, Paige.
- I was afraid you were gonna say that.

94
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,748
- What's the matter?
- Not sure. I've been around you enough

95
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:58,210
- to know when something's not right.
- What? Magically wrong?

96
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,839
- Don't know what else.
- I'm on the clock, gotta speed this up.

97
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:05,717
My friend Mike, my mentor, he's
the one that brought me into the force.

98
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:09,721
I think that... he might be,
you know, possessed, maybe.

99
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:12,432
He's not crazy.
I don't care what anybody says.

100
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,059
Mike would not hurt a fly.

101
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,937
Wait. Back up to the
possessed thing, please.

102
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:21,275
Since Mike retired, he's been working
this jewellery store security on Market.

103
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,945
And lately he's been
having these... episodes.

104
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:26,363
What kind of episodes?

105
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,782
They've been happening more frequently.

106
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:32,119
Yesterday he snapped.
Started waving his gun around,

107
00:07:32,286 --> 00:07:36,248
talking about he's gonna die at
some terrible fire at Cabaret Fantome.

108
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:38,250
I haven't heard of that place.

109
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:42,462
Look, I haven't asked you guys
for help like this before.

110
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,508
Okay. Well, if I move
my staff meeting to 11.00,

111
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,511
and my 1 to 1.30, I should
be able to help you right now.

112
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,264
So I will check
the archives for the club.

113
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,267
Paige, you go with Darryl
and check out this Mike guy.

114
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:58,228
We'll meet back here at like,
I don't know, 1.10.

115
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:07,362
No! I need...
I need somebody to listen to me!

116
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,615
I don't have much time.
You understand?

117
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,034
I don't have much time!

118
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:17,664
You see what I mean?

119
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,584
It doesn't seem demonic.

120
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:23,921
Not demonic? I'm telling you,
he doesn't even know who I am.

121
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,423
- He doesn't know who he is.
- I gotta get out!

122
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,011
- Help! Let me get out of here!
- He mostly seems afraid and panicky.

123
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:34,473
All right, here goes.

124
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,398
- Hi, I... I'm...
- Marie!

125
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,905
No, I'm Paige. Who's Marie?

126
00:08:50,072 --> 00:08:53,659
My fiancée. She's trapped too.

127
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,870
- Trapped where?
- At the club with everybody else.

128
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:58,539
Cabaret Fantome?

129
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,750
Yes! Yes, you know it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

130
00:09:01,917 --> 00:09:04,169
- You believe me?
- Just relax, Mike.

131
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:07,673
No! My name is George.
I keep telling you that!

132
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,092
We're gonna die.
Don't you understand?

133
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,305
If that's not possession, what is it?

134
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:22,354
Cabaret Fantome, deadly fire.
Maybe Darryl's friend isn't so crazy.

135
00:09:22,521 --> 00:09:25,732
The Count's club was the biggest,
most corrupt in the city.

136
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,527
Until it burned down,
killing everyone inside.

137
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,780
Why would the Count set the fire
in the club, only to die in it?

138
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:35,117
I don't know, maybe he
couldn't get out fast enough?

139
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:39,371
- Maybe we should talk to George.
- George? Who's George?

140
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,708
If I'm right, he's somebody
who died in the fire.

141
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:46,837
I think he's a spirit that's possessed
Mike and he's crying out for help.

142
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:50,674
But why would he need help?
The fire happened over 100 years ago.

143
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,260
Help from the pain
of being a Lost Soul, perhaps.

144
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:57,055
Paige asked me to do a little
research in between classes.

145
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,225
"Possessions, Confessions,
and Ghostly Obsessions:

146
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,603
A Demon's Guide to Everything Magical."

147
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,981
I used to sell these.
Talk about a tough item to move.

148
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:11,320
"Lost Souls are spirits of the dead,

149
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:14,323
unable to move on
because of spiritual confusion"?

150
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:18,827
That's when souls die
a violent death together.

151
00:10:20,162 --> 00:10:23,790
The fires of Gomorrah,
the Flood, Pompeii.

152
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:29,171
I would step back. The book
likes to show off a little, don't you?

153
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,341
What the hell?

154
00:10:32,508 --> 00:10:35,260
Don't be afraid,
it's simply illustrating a point.

155
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,055
When souls die at once,
the good ones can't move on

156
00:10:38,222 --> 00:10:41,433
because the bad ones
are holding 'em back. And vice versa.

157
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,312
They're lost, they're stuck
in their respective afterlives,

158
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:49,733
unaware of their tragic fate.
It's really sad, actually.

159
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:54,988
But if they're unaware,
how are we supposed to help George?

160
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,616
We can't.
Unless we enter his world

161
00:10:57,783 --> 00:11:01,828
and find out which one of those
bad souls is holding him back.

162
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:04,832
- Excuse me?
- Well, this spell would get us there,

163
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,835
but I'm not gonna tell you
what it is unless you take me.

164
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,962
Wait, us?

165
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:12,589
How many chances
do we have to go to the 1890s?

166
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:15,342
It's not going to the 1890s
that's the problem.

167
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:18,095
- It's getting back.
- Don't worry, little lady.

168
00:11:18,262 --> 00:11:22,182
The spell'll only keep us with the souls
till the moment they become lost.

169
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,519
- In this case, when the fire begins.
- How do we free George?

170
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:27,312
I don't know, we wing it.

171
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,317
Okay. I don't know. I'm gonna
go check out some other things.

172
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,653
All right. You don't have to go,
but you do.

173
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,198
- I can't! I have an interview.
- Interview shminterview.

174
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:42,035
How does an interview weigh in
against the fate of an innocent?

175
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:45,122
Your premonition skills
could prove essential.

176
00:11:45,289 --> 00:11:48,500
And it is the next logical step
in our whirlwind romance.

177
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,461
What whirlwind romance?

178
00:11:51,712 --> 00:11:53,630
The one we'd be having if we had time.

179
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:56,300
Come on, I don't have
long to live, I'm dying here.

180
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,845
A soul needs your help.
So, what do you say?

181
00:12:14,818 --> 00:12:16,987
Are you sure this is the place?

182
00:12:17,154 --> 00:12:19,448
It says here it's where
the cabaret used to be.

183
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:22,993
A vacant lot after 106 years?

184
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:26,872
It's probably haunted.
Or better yet cursed. Cool, let's go.

185
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,249
There a reason we
can't do this from home?

186
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:33,337
The closer to where the souls were lost,
the better the chances of finding

187
00:12:33,504 --> 00:12:37,591
the exact one we are looking for.
Excuse me. Safety first.

188
00:12:37,758 --> 00:12:39,218
What?

189
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,724
- What are you doing?
- Getting comfortable. What else?

190
00:12:45,891 --> 00:12:49,228
You don't want my body...
slumped in the front seat.

191
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:51,647
It's too conspicuous.

192
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:56,401
Phoebe, living isn't about tasks.
It's about living.

193
00:12:57,736 --> 00:13:01,782
All right. Paige, are you gonna make
sure Elise bumps my interview two hours?

194
00:13:01,949 --> 00:13:04,576
- I'm all over it.
- We will be back before two hours?

195
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:06,954
We'll return just when the fire begins.

196
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,374
Which, based on what you
said about George, seems imminent.

197
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:14,336
Free our souls from their shells
See where the lost spirits dwell

198
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:18,841
Long enough to find their pain
Quick enough to return again

199
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,226
Oh, my!

200
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,566
- This is...
- Fantastic.

201
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,402
Well, you look stunning.

202
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,072
Why, thank you.
You don't look so bad yourself.

203
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:43,866
Well, thank you very much.

204
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,914
- So, what do we do now?
- We mingle.

205
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,803
Ladies, please.

206
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,099
Toulouse, who the hell is that?

207
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:13,270
Never seen 'em before, boss.

208
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:16,815
Nor have I. Find out who they are.

209
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,331
Pardon us.

210
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:35,918
So all these people are stuck
in some, like, ghostly limbo?

211
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:38,712
- As if the fire never happened?
- It happened.

212
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:40,756
Otherwise they wouldn't be here.

213
00:14:40,923 --> 00:14:44,593
Keep your eyes in your socket.
We're here for George, remember?

214
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,137
That doesn't mean
we can't enjoy ourselves.

215
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,057
Come on, it's 1899.
You may not remember, but I do.

216
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:53,227
What, the Gilded Age?

217
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:58,106
It's a time when everyone thought
life couldn't possibly get any better.

218
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,777
There was science.
There was art. There was peace and love.

219
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:04,696
And romance.
Everything was a celebration.

220
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:08,283
This is a celebration?
Everyone's dead, just like...

221
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:12,120
George? George?

222
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,957
- What'd you do to him?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

223
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:18,460
Don't lie to me. I saw him
talking to you and now he's gone.

224
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:20,921
What can I say.
He likes my cards.

225
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:25,259
Still, I don't know where he is.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

226
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:28,262
Excuse me?

227
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,473
I couldn't help but overhear.
Do you know George?

228
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,809
- Who are you?
- That doesn't matter.

229
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:37,604
But what does matter
is that George came to us for help.

230
00:15:38,856 --> 00:15:42,484
- About the fire?
- What fire? What are you talking about?

231
00:15:42,651 --> 00:15:45,737
- I don't have time for this!
- She doesn't know either?

232
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,031
That's because it hasn't happened yet.

233
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:51,869
Not as far as she's concerned.
Not as far as they're all concerned.

234
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,330
They're doomed to repeat the last
few hours over and over.

235
00:15:55,497 --> 00:15:57,916
It's like a never-ending loop.

236
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:01,503
That's just terrible. What could
possibly cause such a thing?

237
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,131
What or who?

238
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:12,181
- Well?
- Well, they're not the law.

239
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:16,059
- I don't know where they came from.
- I'm interested in how they got in.

240
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,645
And if they're my way out.

241
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:22,524
What do you mean?

242
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:25,694
Toulouse, what if I was
to tell you everyone in this room

243
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,697
has been reliving
this same night for over 100 years?

244
00:16:28,864 --> 00:16:32,826
Like rats on a wheel.
I mean, nobody knows it but me.

245
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,163
And what if,
no matter what anybody did,

246
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,292
or how hard they tried,
there's absolutely no way out?

247
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:44,796
And all the drinking
and gambling and... the girls.

248
00:16:44,963 --> 00:16:47,716
Well, what if they didn't mean squat?

249
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,010
What if, you'll love this,

250
00:16:50,177 --> 00:16:52,930
I told you that it was
going to be like that forever?

251
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:57,226
Forever. What would you say then?

252
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,687
Well... Would I get to keep my tips?

253
00:17:03,315 --> 00:17:04,816
Bring me a Scotch.

254
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,946
Champagne for the lady,
and a cigar for the gentleman.

255
00:17:09,112 --> 00:17:11,865
I want them to be comfortable
when I meet them.

256
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:13,659
Yes, sir.

257
00:17:18,789 --> 00:17:21,208
Okay, if you guys
are not back in two minutes,

258
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,252
I'm calling Piper!

259
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:39,560
Hey, Elise. What are you doing here?

260
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:41,895
Well, what do you mean?

261
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:44,189
I'm here with Cosmo for the photo shoot.

262
00:17:44,356 --> 00:17:45,607
Where's Phoebe?

263
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,943
Phoebe...

264
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:51,822
Didn't you get her message?
She said she's gonna have to reschedule.

265
00:17:51,989 --> 00:17:55,784
- What?!
- Yeah, just for a couple hours.

266
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,498
I never got the message
to push the shoot.

267
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,125
Are you out of your mind?

268
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:06,128
We're talking national exposure here
for her column!

269
00:18:06,295 --> 00:18:09,047
The kind you can't buy,
and the deadline is tonight!

270
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,924
And no, I can't just...

271
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:16,680
Phoebe? Phoebe, we talked about this.

272
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:19,808
Blow it with Cosmo once,
you don't get a second chance.

273
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:22,269
- What is the matter with her?
- Well...

274
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,856
- I'd say that she's got food poisoning.
- Food poisoning?!

275
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,776
I think the more she can sleep,
the quicker she'll get better.

276
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:34,740
- When? When is she gonna get better?
- Well, like I was trying to say...

277
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,075
A couple hours.

278
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,163
Have you thought about
doing it at the office?

279
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:46,001
Well, that is where
I originally wanted it, but...

280
00:18:46,168 --> 00:18:49,004
See? You're brilliant.
Really, a brilliant woman.

281
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,298
Okay, I promise you'll have her there.

282
00:18:51,465 --> 00:18:52,716
She better be.

283
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:57,638
Piper!

284
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,765
Piper, Leo!

285
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:06,730
- How was the vacation?
- This better be an emergency.

286
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:09,191
We were just about
to go for a gondola ride.

287
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,078
Oh, for the love of God.

288
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,504
Hey, a fan dance.

289
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:31,964
I love a fan dance.

290
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,925
Wait'll you see this. Never mind.

291
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:38,595
Yes, it is quite a sight.
A beautiful woman onstage,

292
00:19:38,762 --> 00:19:42,015
nothing between her and the audience
except two ostrich fans.

293
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:46,061
The allure of the dance is to watch
how she moves with the fans.

294
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,730
Showing only what she wants,
not an inch more.

295
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:51,149
Is the dance ever performed by a man?

296
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:57,030
So, tell me, my new friends,
how exactly do you know George?

297
00:19:57,197 --> 00:19:59,449
What makes you think that we do?

298
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:02,536
Well, I saw you talking
to his fiancée, Marie.

299
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,414
She seems terribly distraught,
doesn't she?

300
00:20:05,581 --> 00:20:08,167
- She doesn't know what happened to him.
- Do you?

301
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,878
I've been concerned about him recently.

302
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:15,883
Keeping an eye on him, you know.
He is my best barkeep, after all.

303
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:19,261
- And you don't know what happened?
- I wish I did.

304
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:24,099
So, how did you come to learn
about Cabaret Fantome?

305
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:27,102
Word gets out.

306
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:30,022
Hard to keep a place like this
hidden forever.

307
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:35,110
- Do you like the cigar?
- Quite.

308
00:20:35,277 --> 00:20:39,364
They're hand rolled in Havana, and
shipped to my dealer Philippe, special.

309
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:41,158
He's right across the street.

310
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:44,203
Would you like to take in the night air,
pay him a visit?

311
00:20:44,369 --> 00:20:47,080
- He loves new customers.
- Sure. Care to join us?

312
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:52,085
Sadly, I'm unable to leave the club.

313
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:55,380
- And why is that?
- Because as they say...

314
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:59,301
...the show must go on, right?

315
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:06,141
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome your host, Count Roget.

316
00:21:06,892 --> 00:21:11,438
Feel free to enjoy the show from here.
It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

317
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,440
We're dying to see it.

318
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:35,462
Right on time.

319
00:21:44,471 --> 00:21:48,225
Could have waited till after the show.
Come on, we gotta get to the spot.

320
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,997
George!

321
00:22:10,873 --> 00:22:13,417
- George!
- We have to help her!

322
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:15,919
George, where are you?

323
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:19,506
We can't. We stay, we burn.
Don't worry, she'll be back tomorrow.

324
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:23,135
The fire!

325
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:25,721
What's wrong? What's going on?

326
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:28,557
- Go, go get some help.
- Right away.

327
00:22:36,857 --> 00:22:37,900
Marie!

328
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:44,323
Just hold on.

329
00:23:01,256 --> 00:23:04,968
There's nothing in the Book
that tells us how to get 'em back.

330
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,763
Since I can't talk to the Elders...

331
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,270
- Phoebe?
- Are you all right?

332
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:18,857
I don't know.

333
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:28,450
And that's when the good souls
tried to escape, but couldn't.

334
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,453
- Couldn't?
- Yeah, the exits were magically sealed.

335
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,789
I got dead leg.
I'll be down here. Sorry.

336
00:23:33,956 --> 00:23:36,416
At least nobody knows
they're gonna re-live it.

337
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:40,003
The Count knew. He just stood there
watching everybody burn.

338
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,549
- You think he's a demon?
- If he was, he wouldn't be reliving it.

339
00:23:43,715 --> 00:23:45,884
No, but maybe he made
a deal with a demon.

340
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:48,470
If he's the soul trying
to hold everyone back,

341
00:23:48,637 --> 00:23:50,764
he'd do anything
to keep from moving on.

342
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:54,476
Doesn't seem like much of a deal,
though. He's stuck as well.

343
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:57,604
But anything's better
than Purgatory. Trust me, it's...

344
00:23:57,771 --> 00:24:01,567
He's probably trying to buy time.
Find another way out.

345
00:24:01,733 --> 00:24:05,195
How do we help George
and the other souls move on?

346
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,739
Find a way to separate
their souls from the Count's.

347
00:24:07,906 --> 00:24:10,367
- How?
- Find who he made the deal with

348
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:11,827
and get him to break it.

349
00:24:11,994 --> 00:24:14,079
- Think that demon's around?
- This one is.

350
00:24:14,246 --> 00:24:18,792
Yeah, but not for long.
Besides, that's not really the point.

351
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,461
I mean, enough about me.
What do you think of me?

352
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:24,715
Let's go check the Book.
Andiamo!

353
00:24:24,882 --> 00:24:26,341
Ciao, ciao!

354
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:28,302
Maybe we should talk to George

355
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:31,096
and see if he remembers
what the demon looks like.

356
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,639
Hello! Hello!

357
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:35,559
Magazine. Interview.
Cosmo. Cancelling twice.

358
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:38,604
I think this is more important
than Cosmo, don't you?

359
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:42,065
Paige, there's a lot more
to life than work.

360
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:45,944
- There's adventure.
- Really? I wouldn't know.

361
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:48,322
Hey, I have an idea.
Why don't you do it?

362
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,823
- What?
- Be me!

363
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,117
You can glamour.
You've done it before.

364
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:55,204
It'll give you a taste of life
outside Magic School.

365
00:24:55,370 --> 00:24:59,291
Besides, if anyone knows me as well
as I know me, it's you. Just fake it!

366
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,376
Why don't I just go talk to George?

367
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:04,505
Because if we have to go back
at the cabaret afterwards,

368
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:08,175
the Count is expecting Phoebe.
Feathers and all.

369
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,552
- Feathers?
- Don't ask.

370
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:19,394
The doctors are saying that
he's schizophrenic or something.

371
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:23,315
First he's George, then he's back
to being Mike again. Now he's George.

372
00:25:23,482 --> 00:25:26,485
That must be who we saw
get back in the club before we left.

373
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:29,863
Perhaps the fire's what pulled
George back in the time warp.

374
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,573
He knows what's going on.

375
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,243
And can only escape long enough
to cry for help.

376
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,869
What are you talking about?

377
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:39,081
The fire your friend's
screaming about is real. Very real.

378
00:25:39,248 --> 00:25:42,709
- The fire. Help me, please!
- That's how poor George died.

379
00:25:42,876 --> 00:25:45,546
The only way he knows how
to cry for help

380
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:48,674
- is to possess your friend.
- But why Mike?

381
00:25:49,424 --> 00:25:51,426
Proximity.

382
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,929
- I need to get out of here!
- You ready?

383
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,682
- No.
- Let's go.

384
00:25:56,849 --> 00:26:00,227
I gotta get out of the fire!

385
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:03,230
It's coming back!

386
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:07,734
- I need somebody to believe me!
- We believe you, George.

387
00:26:11,405 --> 00:26:12,447
George?

388
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:17,995
- Then you do believe me?
- Yes.

389
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,166
We also saw Marie just as we left.

390
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,293
Well, you...

391
00:26:24,459 --> 00:26:28,547
Well, you can go in and out
without getting burned? How?

392
00:26:28,714 --> 00:26:31,091
Well, you kinda have to die first.

393
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:33,886
We can go back in
to free you and everybody else,

394
00:26:34,052 --> 00:26:37,639
- but we're gonna need your help.
- Anything! Anything!

395
00:26:37,806 --> 00:26:41,393
- What can you tell us about the Count?
- He's the one who did this.

396
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:46,064
- He cursed everybody to save himself.
- Yeah, we know.

397
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:49,151
Maybe he was talking
to someone else, maybe there's...

398
00:26:49,318 --> 00:26:52,738
Did you see him talk to anybody else,
anyone unusual that night?

399
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:55,741
Yes, yes!
Every night before the show,

400
00:26:55,908 --> 00:27:00,579
he sits with this frightening-looking
man at the centre table.

401
00:27:00,746 --> 00:27:04,208
And then the Count,
he signs something.

402
00:27:04,374 --> 00:27:07,753
- That could be the deal.
- They might still be there.

403
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,505
This may be a silly question.

404
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:12,549
Is there anything we can do
to make you more comfortable?

405
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,635
Save Marie.

406
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,776
Kids are down for the count.
No pun intended.

407
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:33,570
- What are you doing?
- Me? Nothing.

408
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,865
Yes, you are.
You're writing in the Book?

409
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:38,951
No, I was just looking for demons.

410
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:42,663
"Tips for future Whitelighters."

411
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:45,123
What?

412
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:48,961
It's just something I was
working on for the kids. You know...

413
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:55,092
No, I don't know. Why can't you tell
them this yourself when they're ready?

414
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:57,761
Because I might not be around.

415
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:00,347
- Come on.
- I know you wanna ignore everything

416
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:02,599
going on with the Elders,
but I can't.

417
00:28:02,766 --> 00:28:05,519
We don't know what
they're gonna do or when.

418
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:08,397
They can't just
yank you out of our lives, Leo.

419
00:28:08,564 --> 00:28:10,899
- How do you know that?
- Because they can't.

420
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,902
And if they did, I'd quit.
We'd all quit.

421
00:28:15,112 --> 00:28:18,615
Is that why you didn't want
to go around the world in 80 orbs?

422
00:28:18,782 --> 00:28:22,536
Yeah, I just wanted to finish it.
Just in case.

423
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:24,830
Okay.

424
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,082
Did you even look for demons?

425
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:30,252
Yeah, I found this one.

426
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:34,423
Sargon. Traders of souls,
preys on the afterlife.

427
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:38,343
Well, it certainly looks
like our guy except...

428
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,721
...we vanquished him already.

429
00:28:46,226 --> 00:28:49,229
I can do this.
I can do this. I can do this.

430
00:28:50,606 --> 00:28:52,858
You owe me.

431
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:58,405
Hello, sis.

432
00:29:03,994 --> 00:29:08,165
Phoebe, there you are! You look great!
You feeling better? You are so late!

433
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:13,253
- I know. Maybe we should reschedule.
- Not a chance! Come meet everybody.

434
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,590
- Hi, I'm Cameron.
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.

435
00:29:16,757 --> 00:29:20,385
- So, you're the photographer?
- I'm interviewing you.

436
00:29:20,552 --> 00:29:22,804
We spoke on the phone? Twice?

437
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:25,641
That's right, I'm sorry.
I got confused.

438
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:28,727
I thought you said,
"I'm the camera man."

439
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:33,273
Okay, so I'm gonna ask you questions
while they shoot.

440
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,192
- That all right with you?
- Sure.

441
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,902
- Okay, great.
- Shoot away.

442
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:43,033
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. It's just new contacts.

443
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,910
So why don't we start with

444
00:29:45,077 --> 00:29:49,206
what inspired you
to become an advice columnist?

445
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,709
That's a really good question.

446
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:56,797
Well, I guess growing up
as an only child...

447
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:58,799
I'm sorry, only child?

448
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,927
I meant Paige grew up as an only child.

449
00:30:02,094 --> 00:30:07,850
I mean, that's how she grew up until
she met her sisters, you know, us... me.

450
00:30:08,684 --> 00:30:10,769
And that had absolutely nothing to do

451
00:30:10,936 --> 00:30:14,231
with why Phoebe
became an advice columnist.

452
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:18,026
She talks about herself
in the third person.

453
00:30:19,111 --> 00:30:21,738
Yeah, what I meant to say was that

454
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:25,784
Paige really had
a lot to do with my decision.

455
00:30:26,702 --> 00:30:29,204
Well, she opened up
a whole new world for me,

456
00:30:29,371 --> 00:30:32,249
and made me see
how much I really have to offer.

457
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:37,087
And I can honestly say,
that I would not be standing here today

458
00:30:37,254 --> 00:30:41,216
- if it wasn't for Paige.
- Oh, great!

459
00:30:43,677 --> 00:30:46,388
Hi, okay. According to Mike...

460
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:47,890
- George.
- Whatever.

461
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,475
There was a demon
in the club that night who...

462
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,811
We vanquished, five years ago.

463
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:55,439
- What? Are you serious?
- 'Fraid so.

464
00:30:55,606 --> 00:30:58,275
According to the Book,
there aren't other demons

465
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:01,528
- who could've made the deal.
- How do we get 'em to unmake it?

466
00:31:01,695 --> 00:31:03,280
- We go back.
- No! What? No!

467
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:06,658
No, he's right. It's the only way
we're gonna find the demon.

468
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:09,453
You said you'd barely
made it out alive last time.

469
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,663
You don't even know what he looks like.

470
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:14,374
- George told us where to find him.
- It's simple.

471
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:18,337
We go back. I talk to him demon
to demon, talon to talon, claw to claw.

472
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:22,090
- Make him unmake the deal.
- Hopefully, the souls'll be released.

473
00:31:22,257 --> 00:31:24,927
- Yeah.
- Okay. Let's do it.

474
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:30,224
This time no messing around, okay?
We get in, we find him, we get out.

475
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,518
- Might wanna stay for the show.
- Wait!

476
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:36,313
- What are we supposed to do?
- What you always do. Worry.

477
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:43,070
We're late.

478
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:45,989
No, we're not. Let's go.

479
00:31:46,156 --> 00:31:49,034
There's nobody at that centre table.

480
00:31:49,201 --> 00:31:51,203
Your demon is long gone.

481
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:55,332
In fact, he left 106 years ago.
Right after we made the deal.

482
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:56,667
Long before the fire.

483
00:31:56,834 --> 00:32:00,879
You know... The fire!
It's coming back! You gotta believe me!

484
00:32:01,046 --> 00:32:02,589
Sit down.

485
00:32:02,756 --> 00:32:06,218
Please, you gotta help me and Marie!
Or something like that?

486
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:10,681
Oh, my God.
That was you in Mike's body.

487
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,558
- You tricked us!
- Slow down.

488
00:32:12,724 --> 00:32:16,812
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome your host, Count Roget.

489
00:32:19,648 --> 00:32:24,695
I regret to inform you that tonight's
fan dance is going to be cancelled.

490
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:44,548
Really think that gun's
gonna do anything?

491
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:48,010
Indeed. If you can burn,
you can bleed.

492
00:32:52,222 --> 00:32:56,393
You really shouldn't bother.
Both of you will die soon enough.

493
00:32:57,769 --> 00:33:00,856
Since your friend George
has found a temporary way out,

494
00:33:01,023 --> 00:33:04,443
I now have found
my permanent way out.

495
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:15,496
You know, they haven't
been gone that long, relax.

496
00:33:15,662 --> 00:33:20,292
Oh, no! I can't relax.
I worry, remember?

497
00:33:24,129 --> 00:33:28,133
Drake. What happened?

498
00:33:29,343 --> 00:33:31,845
Why isn't Phoebe waking up?

499
00:33:32,638 --> 00:33:37,017
Drake? Did you hear me?
What the hell is wrong with Phoebe?

500
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,897
I suppose she didn't make it.

501
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,370
What do you mean she didn't make it?
How is that possible?

502
00:33:56,537 --> 00:33:59,331
I don't know. Clumsy...

503
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,962
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

504
00:34:05,128 --> 00:34:09,174
Actually, I'm splendid.
I mean... swell.

505
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,218
You have to get her
before the fire starts.

506
00:34:11,385 --> 00:34:13,428
It's already begun.

507
00:34:13,595 --> 00:34:15,556
Then you need to go get her. Go!

508
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:18,267
No! What do you mean, go back there?

509
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:20,561
- Forget it.
- Why not?

510
00:34:24,106 --> 00:34:26,400
Perhaps if I go...

511
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:31,405
...outside...

512
00:34:34,241 --> 00:34:36,243
Have a smoke, you know, like...

513
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:40,581
Consider the possibility of going back.

514
00:34:40,747 --> 00:34:43,917
- I gotta go. Excuse me.
- Who are you?

515
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:45,752
Count Roget!

516
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:54,094
Oh, not bad!
I guess I did choose the right body.

517
00:34:54,261 --> 00:34:57,848
No, don't.
You're in enough trouble already with...

518
00:34:58,015 --> 00:35:00,225
...the Elders.

519
00:35:10,027 --> 00:35:12,571
Go. I'm gonna die anyway.
Get out of here!

520
00:35:12,738 --> 00:35:17,618
Not like this. If George can get out, we
can too. We have to think about this.

521
00:35:21,038 --> 00:35:23,457
- Fortune teller.
- Okay.

522
00:35:27,669 --> 00:35:31,131
Perfect.
Perfect escape from the ordinary.

523
00:35:31,298 --> 00:35:33,091
Five card spread.

524
00:35:35,177 --> 00:35:37,888
Listen, odds are
the Count's possessed my body.

525
00:35:38,055 --> 00:35:40,265
Until he's evicted, I got nowhere to go.

526
00:35:40,432 --> 00:35:43,852
Only you can get out to your body.
Even though I'm into your body,

527
00:35:44,019 --> 00:35:46,522
- I still can't get out.
- I'll come back for you.

528
00:35:46,688 --> 00:35:49,107
If he puts up a fight,
you vanquish my sorry ass.

529
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:51,401
I don't care.
But only as a last resort.

530
00:35:51,568 --> 00:35:55,614
Okay.
Vita Brevis Abraxis

531
00:35:58,492 --> 00:36:00,202
Can I get a water?

532
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:06,375
This should dispossess him,
if we can find him.

533
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:10,254
He's off the radar. There's nothing
in the Book to help locate him.

534
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,714
You were onto something a minute ago.

535
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:16,844
- Phoebe?
- Where's the Count?

536
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,639
Wait a minute.
What's my middle name?

537
00:36:20,806 --> 00:36:24,518
- Surly?
- That's my girl.

538
00:36:24,685 --> 00:36:26,770
Whatever, where's Drake's body?

539
00:36:26,937 --> 00:36:30,899
- We don't know.
- We can't scry for him.

540
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:33,819
We're thinking maybe
he's in a pub, or a restaurant.

541
00:36:33,986 --> 00:36:36,113
Or a tobacco shop.

542
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,323
I think I know where to find him.

543
00:36:45,122 --> 00:36:49,001
- What kind of terrible world is this?
- One you'll be leaving soon.

544
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:53,505
- No. They'll take me away!
- Go to hell!

545
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,387
Darryl.

546
00:37:44,515 --> 00:37:46,850
Mike. Is that you?

547
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:48,435
Of course it's me.

548
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:54,483
What's... what's going on here?

549
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,445
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

550
00:38:06,495 --> 00:38:08,997
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

551
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:14,711
Thank you so much.
Thank you for bringing me back.

552
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:18,090
Thank you.
This boy was getting hot.

553
00:38:18,257 --> 00:38:20,008
I'll bet.

554
00:38:50,205 --> 00:38:52,916
Leonardo, it's bene.

555
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:57,379
The vacation was a great idea.

556
00:38:57,546 --> 00:38:59,840
Just not great timing.

557
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,301
Yeah, well. Life is short, bella.

558
00:39:02,467 --> 00:39:05,179
- Are you quoting Drake now?
- He's got a point.

559
00:39:05,345 --> 00:39:08,015
Thanks for trying to distract me
from the Elders.

560
00:39:08,182 --> 00:39:10,601
I wish it would've worked out
the way I planned.

561
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:12,060
Could be worse.

562
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:18,150
I think from now on I'm gonna stop
trying to control every little moment.

563
00:39:18,984 --> 00:39:21,862
The best ones kinda
sneak up on you anyway.

564
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:34,458
- Excuse me, have you seen Phoebe?
- Very funny.

565
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:38,545
Wow, I haven't seen you
this relaxed in quite a long time.

566
00:39:38,712 --> 00:39:42,007
After having been you, I kinda see why.

567
00:39:42,174 --> 00:39:45,886
Well, I'm trying to take a step back
and enjoy every moment.

568
00:39:46,053 --> 00:39:48,055
Hey, thank you.

569
00:39:48,222 --> 00:39:50,557
You did a great job.
Nobody ever knew.

570
00:39:50,724 --> 00:39:54,186
Well, you're welcome.
I think after reading the article,

571
00:39:54,353 --> 00:39:57,981
you'll find that your little sister
got praised quite a bit.

572
00:39:58,148 --> 00:39:59,816
Deservedly so.

573
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:03,111
- I think I got more out of it than you.
- Yeah.

574
00:40:03,278 --> 00:40:05,656
I kinda miss being out there
in the real world.

575
00:40:05,823 --> 00:40:08,075
Maybe you should
do something about that.

576
00:40:08,242 --> 00:40:10,118
Maybe I will.

577
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:14,456
Ladies and gentlemen,
P3 is proud to present

578
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:18,001
- a one night only show by...
- What's going on?

579
00:40:18,168 --> 00:40:19,670
...Drake Demond.

580
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,338
Oh, my God.

581
00:40:21,505 --> 00:40:24,299
This is what happens
when you have one week to live?

582
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:28,512
- What is he up to?
- Just be grateful it's not a fan dance.
