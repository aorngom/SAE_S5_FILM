1
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,876
I guess my invitation must've
gotten lost in the mail.

2
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,989
- I told you I'd find you again, satyr.
- There's nothing for you here.

3
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,991
- Leave this place or I'Il...
- Or you'll what?

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,272
You gonna play your flute?

5
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,036
Who are you? What do you want?

6
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,034
I want you to show me
the Eternal Spring, that's what.

7
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,512
Unless, of course, you want to end up
like your poor satyr here.

8
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:03,029
Only he can tell us
when to reveal the spring.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,079
Now I'm telling you.

10
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,516
Where is it?

11
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,676
I will find you!

12
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,913
Congratulations again, Phoebe.

13
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,548
- Thanks, sweetie. Good night.
- See you.

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,759
Where are you?
Where are you, where are you?

15
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:46,830
- Did you lose something?
- Just my brain and my keys.

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,719
Well, I got some cabs waiting
to take us home downstairs.

17
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:53,031
I need to find my keys so nobody
has to wake up to let me in.

18
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,589
Piper will kill me
if I wake up the baby.

19
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,591
Well, why don't you stay here?

20
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,998
I mean it. I got the place for the
whole night, somebody ought to use it.

21
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,116
Oh, that's sweet.

22
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,515
- Thanks, but I can't.
- Sure you can.

23
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,874
I insist.

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,316
Columnist of the year?
Come on, you deserve it.

25
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,274
Sleep in, have breakfast,

26
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,238
get a massage. It's on me.

27
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,719
What?

28
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,914
You're just a really nice guy,
you know that?

29
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,916
- That's just the champagne talking.
- No, it's not.

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,559
Okay, maybe it is a little.

31
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,879
But, no, you are.

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,792
Renting this suite

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,791
and making sure everyone
gets home okay,

34
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,075
the speech you made...

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,708
Well, you guys deserve all the awards,
not me.

36
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,672
All I did was buy the paper.

37
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,593
I'm glad you did.

38
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,555
Me too.

39
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,833
Good night, boss.

40
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,037
Good night.

41
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,071
- Well, I better get going.
- Yeah.

42
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,670
- Good night.
- Good night.

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,912
- I'm not sure we should be doing this.
- Yeah, me neither.

44
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,518
Gosh, what's that smell?
I hope it's not breakfast.

45
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,910
I'm making an herbal sleep remedy.

46
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,314
Remind me never to get insomnia.

47
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,795
- Cute.
- Cute is a sleeping baby.

48
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:02,394
That baby woke up
every 15 minutes last night.

49
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,232
If I don't make something
to help him sleep,

50
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,755
you're gonna have one cranky mom
on your hands.

51
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,319
"Going to have"?

52
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,756
Now, where is the dried dill?

53
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,831
I can't find anything around here.

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,468
It's in the middle cupboard,
bottom right.

55
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,512
See, I switched things around.

56
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,278
I wanted to separate the herbs
for potions

57
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,714
from the ones we use for cooking.

58
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,956
But we use dill for both.

59
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,031
Well, that's why I put it there

60
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,794
with the herbs and spices that we use
for cooking and magic.

61
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,916
It's a whole new system, see.

62
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,519
Voilà, you have your dill.

63
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,069
Okay, but what was wrong
with the old system?

64
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,118
I mean, it worked perfectly well
for about five years.

65
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,748
Nothing was wrong with it, honey,
it just didn't work for me.

66
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,679
You know, your mind is just
a little more linear, that's all.

67
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,308
Well, you know, I know with Wyatt
and everything lately

68
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,118
that you've had to, you know,

69
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,238
take on more responsibility
for all things Wiccan lately.

70
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,710
But, you know, you don't need

71
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,791
to shoulder the burden
all by yourself anymore.

72
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,439
Sweetheart, it's no burden.

73
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,072
That's why I quit my job, after all.

74
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,955
Yeah, but still, I mean,
it's not fair to you.

75
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,271
Now that I have Leo being Mr. Mom,
I got a little bit more time on my hands.

76
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,111
Well, I don't mind taking the lead.

77
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,235
Morning. Never mind, don't ask.

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,869
Hey, somebody's doing
the walk of shame.

79
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,598
Details, details.

80
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,035
I knew I wasn't gonna
get away with this one.

81
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,309
Not a chance.

82
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,631
- Spill it, sister.
- Okay.

83
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,910
I think I did something really bad.

84
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,079
I slept with my boss.

85
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,912
- Jason?
- No, Elise.

86
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,638
Yes, of course, Jason!

87
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,837
Wow, that is bad.

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,592
For future employment's sake.

89
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,513
Unless, of course... Maybe it'll
work out, and you guys will get married

90
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,240
and have kids, and you could own
half the newspaper.

91
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,032
- Paige.
- Sorry.

92
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,913
- How did this happen?
- It was very fast.

93
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,995
- Downer.
- No, that part wasn't fast.

94
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,230
That part was...

95
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,397
- So that's good, right?
- Yes.

96
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,828
No.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,560
I don't know. See, I'm very conflicted
about this whole thing,

98
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,950
because it's not just the fact
that he's my boss,

99
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,237
it's just I didn't plan on this all
happening right now in my life.

100
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,756
Well, honey, unfortunately, that's
when these things usually happen.

101
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:26,435
Yeah, can we get back to the whole,
like... part?

102
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,076
Talk about "orbis interruptus."

103
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,832
Sorry, I just got an alert
from the Elders.

104
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,434
- Do you know about wood nymphs?
- Wood nymphs?

105
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,113
Yeah, frolicking little tree sprites,

106
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,748
protectors of the forest,
always in the company of a satyr.

107
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,639
Yeah, I know what they are.

108
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,677
It was a rhetorical question.
What about them?

109
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,754
Well, I guess a couple have been
spotted in the city by mortals.

110
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,393
The Elders are worried
about exposure.

111
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,879
Well, that doesn't make any sense,

112
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,917
because they don't abandon
their forest unless...

113
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,672
- They're flushed out.
- By a demon.

114
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,956
- I'll get right on it.
- I'll get right on it.

115
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,028
You're tired, honey.

116
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:00,350
I am. I'll also be in the attic.

117
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,310
Paige, will you orb to the office
and grab my laptop?

118
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,040
I have to finish this article,
and I don't want to see Jason.

119
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,952
I'm sorry, I really can't.

120
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,552
<i>Ask Piper.</i>

121
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,833
Hey, that's cheating.

122
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,749
Why is he still playing this melody?

123
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,313
Maybe he doesn't recognize us.

124
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,548
- Hi.
- He must be our new satyr.

125
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,672
Look how many people
have gathered to adore him.

126
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,757
He's not playing the melody.

127
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,394
Excuse me. Pardon me.

128
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,313
All right, girls, you had your fun.

129
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,748
Let's go.

130
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,749
I know, I know.

131
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,520
- What should we do?
- Flee.

132
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,598
What are you doing?

133
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,599
I'm practicing.

134
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,954
In case you can't find the nymphs,

135
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,556
I thought maybe I could try
and lure them to us.

136
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,280
How many times
have I told you, Tull,

137
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,556
only a satyr can master that thing.

138
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,278
I don't know why you keep trying.

139
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,032
- Well, because Father...
- Father's dead!

140
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,838
Don't you understand?

141
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,592
And we're never gonna
get our revenge

142
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,433
unless we find that damn spring
and become unstoppable.

143
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,150
I'm just trying
to help you find them, Xavier.

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,672
I already did.

145
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,355
They've escaped to the city,
just like I thought they would.

146
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,032
But they're out of their element.

147
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,555
Lost without nature, confused.

148
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,351
So how do you know
where they are?

149
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,468
They found an oasis
in the middle of it all, a fountain.

150
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,674
One which they'll return to tonight
when the moon is full.

151
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,916
To rejoice in it.

152
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,548
Xavier, can I come?
Please, can I join you?

153
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,672
No.

154
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,799
You aren't strong enough to help.

155
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,558
But don't worry, you will be.

156
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,837
Once you drink from the spring.

157
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,396
Until then...

158
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,473
...keep practicing.

159
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,434
- Phoebe.
- Shoot.

160
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,272
Hey.

161
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,999
I didn't even see you come in.

162
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,879
I just came by to get my laptop.
I'm gonna work from home.

163
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,508
- Okay, bye.
- Wait, there's a staff meeting.

164
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,079
You have to stay for that.

165
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,629
Oh, that's right, I totally forgot.

166
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,878
Listen, about last night...

167
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,032
It was a huge mistake. I agree,
it should've never happened.

168
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,758
Actually, that's not what
I was gonna say.

169
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,229
- No?
- I thought it was amazing.

170
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,674
I think you're amazing.

171
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,958
Really?

172
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,235
See, but that's not the point.

173
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,070
The point is, you're my boss.

174
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,710
And I don't want my professional
and personal life to collide.

175
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,438
Isn't it a little late for that?

176
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,831
No. We can stop this right here
and now, before it gets any worse.

177
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,672
Before what gets any worse?

178
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,035
Phoebe, we have nothing
to be ashamed of.

179
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,272
We're two intelligent adults who
happen to be attracted to each other.

180
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,714
What's so wrong with that?

181
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,393
Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Dean,

182
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,233
but looks like those Godiva girls
popped up again.

183
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,993
Oh, no.

184
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,511
- Anybody know who they are?
- Not yet,

185
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,638
- but everybody wants to know.
- Then let's be the first to find out.

186
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,916
Pull Bill and Jean from Metro,
get Francesca online.

187
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,036
I don't want to trail this story,
I want to lead it.

188
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,111
- Understood.
- Phoebe?

189
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,910
What exactly are you doing over there,
writing a dissertation?

190
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,957
No. Actually, since wood nymphs
are considered

191
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,116
the personification of nature,

192
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,239
I am devising a spell using the four
elements to try to locate their home.

193
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,628
Well, what good will that do?

194
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,791
The Elders said the nymphs
were loose in the city.

195
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,269
But I'm thinking that
if we can find out where they lived,

196
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,755
you know, we can find out what
flushed them out

197
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,117
- and see what demon's after them.
- Talk about your roundabout methods.

198
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,952
No, actually, it's like that cliché,

199
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,151
"thinking outside the box."
It kind of applies here.

200
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,512
Well, me, I'm just gonna stick to good,
old-fashioned scrying to find him.

201
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,199
How's that working out for you?

202
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:05,950
Let's just say it's been a busy day
for evil in the city.

203
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,597
I wonder if nymphs have
any natural enemies.

204
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,230
What are all these?

205
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,437
<i>I indexed the Book oF Shadows
to make our searches more efficient.</i>

206
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,398
<i>You colour-coded
the Book oF Shadows?</i>

207
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,112
- When?
- Yesterday.

208
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,511
Now, you see, demons and warlocks
will be under red,

209
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,238
angels and beings of light
under white,

210
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,358
and wood nymphs, because they're
spirits of nature, will be under green

211
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,239
- because green represents...
- I know what green represents.

212
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,356
Great. Then you'll just love it.

213
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,750
I don't think so.

214
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,955
- Isn't that Wyatt calling you?
- Nice try. Leo's got him.

215
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,599
You're not getting rid of me
that easy.

216
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,433
I am not trying to get rid of you,
all right.

217
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,034
I'm just trying to take point
because your life is so busy now

218
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,430
that I thought I would just try to help
a little bit.

219
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,318
I got your busy right here, lady.

220
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,350
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.</i>

221
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,875
I'm stuck at work.
I forgot there was a staff meeting.

222
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,837
<i>- Have you seen the news yet?
- No.</i>

223
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,355
We're too busy fighting over
the best way to find nymphs.

224
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,351
<i>Okay, well, stop arguing</i>

225
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:13,590
and turn on the TV,
because they're all over it.

226
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,069
- What? What do you mean?
- What's she saying?

227
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,276
Nobody knows who they are yet,
but believe me,

228
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,357
the demon is not the only one
looking for them now.

229
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,718
<i>- Where were they last spotted?
- Downtown, City Plaza.</i>

230
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:26,518
Maybe they'll go back there.

231
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,877
Well, if they do, there's gonna be
a demon waiting for them.

232
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,189
Okay, how much longer before you
realize this is not working?

233
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,874
Hey, Phoebe was the one who said
they were here, not me.

234
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,674
No, excuse me. You were the one
that said a demon was here waiting.

235
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,713
I was the one that said
they'd be stupid to come back.

236
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,236
And you think they're not? Half of
San Francisco has spotted them.

237
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,034
Well, at least it looks like
they're having fun.

238
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,358
Hold it. Shouldn't we see
if the demon attacks?

239
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,828
Ladies.

240
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,593
Wait's over.

241
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,318
Last chance.

242
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,029
- Where's the spring?
- Oh, please. Please.

243
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,270
Please, help us.

244
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,117
Why didn't he blow up?

245
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,159
- Let's get out of here.
- First thing we've agreed on all day.

246
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,955
No, no, no.

247
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,873
But we need to be outside
to find our new satyr.

248
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,350
No. No, you don't. Not when there's
a demon out there, you don't.

249
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,636
Paige, a little help, please.

250
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,759
Sorry, Miss Nymph, you're stuck here.

251
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,354
But... But you're suffocating us.

252
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:49,158
But we're meant to be outdoors.

253
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,799
We were born to be wild.

254
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,319
I hear what you're saying.

255
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,471
Nature is a part of us.

256
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,357
We're meant to preserve it,
to nurture it.

257
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,308
Well, that's really great, honey,
but our job is to preserve you, okay?

258
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,994
All right, inside, inside, inside.

259
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,997
What's going on down here?

260
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,197
- Who are they?
- Nymphs, Leo. Clearly nymphs.

261
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,758
Hi there. No wonder the Elders
were worried about exposure.

262
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,839
Who's the sexy beast?

263
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,560
The beast is married, to me.

264
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,676
Now, I don't mean to rain
on anybody's parade,

265
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,593
but didn't you two just lose a sister?
Shouldn't you be,

266
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,875
I don't know, grieving?

267
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,156
Oh, we don't mourn death,
we celebrate it.

268
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,314
It's the way of nature.
The Eternal Spring we protect

269
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,074
ensures that life is always renewed
in the forest.

270
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,595
So she'll be reborn or something?

271
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,152
If not in the plants and trees,

272
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,311
then in the wind and rain
that brings them sustenance.

273
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,391
Isn't that awesome?

274
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,034
Still, without her,
we may not find our new satyr.

275
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:53,193
We need three to perform the dance,
or we may not hear his call.

276
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,594
I'm a little confused.

277
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,309
See, if you guys protect this spring,
what do you need a satyr for?

278
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,916
Because that's the way
it's always been.

279
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,878
- Oh, okay.
- So do you know who the demon is?

280
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:09,278
No, only that he wanted us
to bring him to the Eternal Spring

281
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,158
to drink from it, we assume.

282
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,039
Which would make him immortal.
Indestructible.

283
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,597
We need Phoebe.

284
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,355
- Hello? Anybody home?
- Ask and you shall receive.

285
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,919
Try and keep an eye on them.

286
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,799
Hiya. Where you been?

287
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,032
Avoiding Jason.
Apparently, it didn't work.

288
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,714
Yeah. Well, we found something.

289
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,632
Enough, stop.

290
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,915
- I thought there was three of them.
- Yeah, the demon got one.

291
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,674
Yeah, but on the plus side,
you got some really pretty flowers.

292
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,876
Yeah, see, I don't want
to talk about that.

293
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,832
Tell me about the demon.

294
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,353
Well, Piper let him get away.

295
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,954
Come on, I blew off his hand,
didn't I?

296
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,156
Yes, but the rest of him got away.

297
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,151
Yeah, well, okay,
demons don't always go poof

298
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,594
when you want them to, you know.

299
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,438
What the hell is going on
with you two?

300
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,672
It seems that Paige thinks
she's the lead witch all of the sudden.

301
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,478
That's what's going on.

302
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,070
I don't think I'm lead witch, I've just
had to be for the last few months.

303
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,679
It's all I do.

304
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,434
Maybe while I was
on maternity leave.

305
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,831
But it's like sports, you can't lose
your starting job due to injury.

306
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:20,508
Vanquishing demons
is not a sport, Piper.

307
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,079
It is if you're good at it.

308
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,671
All right, come on.

309
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,558
- Where are you going?
- Wyatt's crying.

310
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,199
They are all yours.

311
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,997
We need to frolic.
We need to find our satyr.

312
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,670
Okay, I would like to frolic too,
but I actually have work to do.

313
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,670
Are you always this tense?

314
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,515
Look, we need to find this demon
before this demon finds them.

315
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,193
<i>All right,
I'm gonna go check the Book.</i>

316
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,879
- I'll go.
- No, wait.

317
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,395
- Let your sister go.
- Thanks.

318
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,752
Why?

319
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,998
You'll see.

320
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,031
Something wrong?

321
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:59,597
Not anymore.

322
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,834
I will have your revenge, Xavier,
I swear it.

323
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,230
They will not get away with this.

324
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,397
It's not the nymphs you have
to worry about, it's the witches.

325
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,552
You're not strong enough
to stand up to them.

326
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,234
But I will be
once I drink from the spring.

327
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,676
And then I'll use the immortal waters
to heal you.

328
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,556
Always the dreamer.

329
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,678
You'll never trick them into thinking
you're their new satyr.

330
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,513
No?

331
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,396
Watch me, brother.

332
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,919
Watch me.

333
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,551
Demons and warlocks are red,
beings of light are white.

334
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:46,190
Oh, yeah? Well, what's a bunyip?
Because it's not good or evil.

335
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,834
So, what the hell colour is that?

336
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,231
Well, that's confusing.

337
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,994
- Everything all right?
- Yeah, sure, fine,

338
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,998
<i>if you call Paige defacing
the Book oF Shadows "all right."</i>

339
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,394
<i>She defaced the Book?</i>

340
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,790
For all intents and purposes.
Look at this.

341
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,350
This is a sacred book.
It looks ridiculous.

342
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,071
Well, look, these things
just come right off. See?

343
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,037
That is so not the point.

344
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,918
- It's not?
- No.

345
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,595
She's done this a lot lately,
and it's not just this. The kitchen.

346
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,997
The least she could do
is discuss it with us beforehand.

347
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,953
You're right, she should've
discussed it with you.

348
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,635
But that's not
what's making you angry.

349
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,917
What are you really feeling?

350
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,149
Okay, you know,
just because we've gone to counselling

351
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,436
doesn't mean
that you're a shrink now.

352
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,955
I'm just saying that this whole
competitive thing you guys...

353
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,230
I'm not competitive, she is.

354
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,913
You both are,
and you both need to stop.

355
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,389
Otherwise, you'll never help
the nymphs reclaim their forest.

356
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,788
I know, I know.

357
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,554
I just can't help but feel like
I'm being pushed aside.

358
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,517
She's not pushing you aside.

359
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,511
She's just picking up the slack.

360
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,597
Okay, just so you know
for future reference,

361
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,672
you're supposed to be on my side
in these situations.

362
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,717
It keeps us out of counselling.

363
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,117
I am on your side, honey. Always.

364
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,871
I'm just saying that maybe

365
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,679
you should look at this
like an opportunity.

366
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,070
Now, this is me talking,
this isn't a shrink.

367
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,468
You're always complaining

368
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,518
about how you're not able to have
a normal life because of witchcraft,

369
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,399
and maybe letting Paige take the lead
once in a while,

370
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,596
it'll allow you to have that.

371
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,638
That's some good
reverse psychology there.

372
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,030
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

373
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:34,558
So how do you know this potion
is gonna work?

374
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,790
Shouldn't we wait for Piper
to find the demon first?

375
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,996
She won't. That's why I went ahead

376
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:42,914
and made this garden-variety,
kick-ass vanquishing potion.

377
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,798
You guys have to stop butting heads.

378
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,996
We work best
when we work together.

379
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:49,355
Well, tell her that. Don't tell me that.

380
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,511
Are you sure she's the one?

381
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,358
She needs us as much
as we need her.

382
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,835
That looks beautiful.
You guys should be florists.

383
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,475
We are. That's what we do.

384
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,279
- In the woods, I mean.
- Right, of course. Sorry.

385
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,954
That's all right.
Most people don't even know we exist.

386
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,112
They take us for granted.
They take the forest for granted,

387
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,748
as if it'll always be there.

388
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,469
- That's why we have to help you.
- Helping us helps you.

389
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,599
After all, all of nature is intertwined:
Forests, flowers,

390
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,318
- love.
- Love.

391
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,152
It's in the air.

392
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,515
Not where I'm standing, it isn't.

393
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:28,274
- I'll get it.
- Good.

394
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,552
You know, Paige,
we think that you need

395
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,075
- to get back to your wild side.
- Wild side.

396
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,550
- Girls, you might just have a point.
- You're right, she is the one.

397
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,153
The one for what?

398
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,193
The one to help us
find our new satyr.

399
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:56,989
Hi.

400
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,639
Jason.

401
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,156
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Well, we never got to finish our talk.

402
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,029
Yeah. Now's not really a good time,
though. I'll call you.

403
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,760
- Did you get the flowers I sent you?
- I did. They were beautiful.

404
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,148
That was very sweet.

405
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:14,438
Look, I know this is awkward for you
because of work and all,

406
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,114
but I think we can
work this thing out.

407
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,829
It's a lot more complicated than that,
believe me.

408
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,550
Phoebe, we have to talk.

409
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,598
I know, and we will soon, I promise.

410
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,113
Phoebe, what's wrong?

411
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,794
Is there something going on here
that you're not telling me about?

412
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,916
No, of course not.

413
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,113
- What was that?
- What was what?

414
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,919
- What was that?
- Oh, that?

415
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,038
Oh, my God, Paige.

416
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,909
So handsome.

417
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,150
You found them.

418
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,439
Isn't that your sister?

419
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,198
Yeah. Paige.

420
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,835
She's one of the Godiva girls?

421
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,953
No, she is not.

422
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,792
Paige, you get back here right now.

423
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:12,031
What's going on here?

424
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,392
I don't suppose you can just forget
about everything you just saw, right?

425
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,278
Personally or professionally?

426
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,318
- Both?
- Phoebe.

427
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,391
Okay, look, just promise me
you won't do anything

428
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,074
- until we talk, okay? For me.
- Talk?

429
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,470
- Talk when?
- We're gonna talk later.

430
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,392
Okay, thanks for the flowers.

431
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,551
I like your jacket. Okay, bye.

432
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,952
Piper! Leo!

433
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,711
We really need to be out looking
for our new satyr, Paige.

434
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,394
I thought all we had to do
was dance to hear his call.

435
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,313
It's her first night as a nymph,
Miranda.

436
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,993
Let's see what she can do.

437
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,390
All right, why not?

438
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,278
Follow me, girls.

439
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,150
I can't sense her. Probably because
she's not a witch anymore.

440
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,878
No, of course not.

441
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,429
Because, thanks to me,
she is now a nymph.

442
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,192
Thanks to you? What did you do?

443
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,998
I had to be the one in control.

444
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,355
I had to be the one to find
the stupid demon,

445
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,279
which, by the way,
I have not done yet.

446
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,591
Well, thanks to me, my paper's gonna
get an exclusive on her,

447
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,079
because I slept with Jason.

448
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,959
Oh, good, so this is all
your fault then? Perfect.

449
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,758
Let's forget about
whose fault this is, okay?

450
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,394
Either way, we need a way
to find Paige before the demon does.

451
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,712
That's not gonna do any good unless
we come up with a vanquishing potion.

452
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,911
- Paige already did that.
- She did?

453
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,433
Yeah.

454
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,513
Hello.

455
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,719
I think we found Paige.

456
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,036
I don't see her.

457
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,758
You don't want to.

458
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,157
That cat's out of the bag.

459
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,673
Come on.

460
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,158
Paige, what are you doing?

461
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,039
I'm dancing, Leo.
Do you want to come dance with me?

462
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,636
No, Paige. Come down here
before somebody recognizes you.

463
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,951
- All right, Paige, looking good!
- So much for that.

464
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,678
Come on, Paige,
we're getting out of here.

465
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,871
I can't.
I can't leave till I find my satyr.

466
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,230
Her satyr? Get...

467
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,473
- Talk to her.
- Paige, honey, listen, we need you.

468
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,558
We can't save your fellow nymphs
without you.

469
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,917
- You don't need me, Piper.
- The hell I don't. Paige, listen to me.

470
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,039
You are not a nymph. You are a witch,
and a damn good one at that.

471
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,679
That is your true nature.

472
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,116
Hey, Piper, you've gotta get
those groupies off the stage.

473
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:44,716
- They're distracting my band.
- I know, I know. I'm working on it.

474
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,629
Piper.

475
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,679
Paige! Wait.

476
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,599
- Where are we going?
- To our new satyr.

477
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,751
Do you hear his call?

478
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,436
Welcome, my little nymphs.

479
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,238
Welcome.

480
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,237
I don't know how the hell to find her.

481
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,470
Well, maybe if we knew
why they decided to turn her

482
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,074
into a nymph in the first place,
that would help.

483
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,276
That's because they needed
a third sister, right?

484
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,955
<i>Yeah, well, the Book also says that
only certain types of magical creatures</i>

485
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,709
can be turned into a nymph.
So, what type was she?

486
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,552
The type that needed
a change, maybe.

487
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,473
From being a witch? That's ridiculous.
Paige loves being a witch.

488
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,758
Until I came roaring back.
And I didn't just push her aside,

489
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,672
I actually pushed Paige
right out the door.

490
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,068
Are we back to blaming you again?

491
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,468
- Yeah.
- Just checking.

492
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,551
Maybe they sensed that
she was overdue for some fun.

493
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,557
She has been working
around the clock lately.

494
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,036
Well, she had plenty of fun
at P3 last night.

495
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,156
Film at 11.

496
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,954
I'll take care of it.
You guys stay on it.

497
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,396
Okay, what haven't we tried?

498
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,199
I think we've pretty much
tried everything.

499
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,478
All right. Well, then it's time to start
thinking outside the box.

500
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,789
Come again?

501
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,078
That was Paige's theory.
It worked pretty damn well for her.

502
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,399
Paige was working on a spell
to locate the nymphs

503
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,357
using the four elements of nature.

504
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,159
- Wow, that's a novel concept.
- Yeah, well, I mocked it.

505
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,557
But if she's right, it should lead us
to where the nymphs live,

506
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,994
and therefore, Paige.

507
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,158
Here's water and fire.

508
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,117
A little bit of wind.

509
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,874
Okay, so all we're missing is earth.

510
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:07,116
I'll go get some dirt
from the back yard.

511
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,629
Hi. Hello.

512
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,677
<i>- Hey, it's Jason.
- Hey.</i>

513
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:16,189
- I can't really talk right now.
- It's not about us, Phoebe.

514
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,952
- It's about your sister.
- What about her?

515
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,953
I'm not the only one who saw her.
There was a photographer

516
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,953
<i>at your sister's club last night
because oF the band.</i>

517
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,679
I've got pictures.

518
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,070
And what are you gonna do
with the pictures?

519
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,275
<i>Well, iF I don't print them,</i>

520
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,391
I'll be the only paper in town
that doesn't.

521
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,199
- You know what, just print them.
- Phoebe...

522
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,873
Look, if we hadn't slept together,
Jason,

523
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,911
you'd have never known
that she was one of them.

524
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,993
If we hadn't slept together,
I wouldn't have hesitated to print them.

525
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,435
Phoebe, will you please tell me
what's going on here?

526
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,113
No comment.

527
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,872
No. No, I don't want any wreaths.

528
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,112
No, no berries.
I just want the Spring.

529
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,192
What's the matter?
Why aren't you dancing?

530
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,796
Something doesn't feel right.

531
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,757
- Is this much farther?
- No.

532
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,275
- We're almost there.
- Good.

533
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,317
How did you know
we needed a new satyr?

534
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,596
You called me with your little dance,
didn't you?

535
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,193
Forgive her, she's new.

536
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,033
Then she should be silent,
shouldn't she?

537
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,714
Shouldn't we be worried about
the demon that killed the last satyr?

538
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,108
- I'll take care of him.
- How?

539
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,714
Enough with your questions, nymph!

540
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,750
It's not our place to question him.
We only wish to please.

541
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,638
But you don't know him.

542
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,473
We protect and nourish the forest
while caring for our satyr.

543
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,871
- That's all we need to know.
- It's in our nature.

544
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,638
It's in your nature.

545
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,950
It's in our nature.
You're one of us now.

546
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,277
- We're here.
- Where? Where is it? Show it to me.

547
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,791
So beautiful.

548
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,789
You.

549
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,992
Hi. No offence, but we were looking
for some wood nymphs.

550
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,519
Wait, you two know each other?

551
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,238
Yeah, I was the one
that blew off his arm.

552
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,868
- Wow, that looks like it hurts.
- It does.

553
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,393
You sure we even need this?

554
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,391
Well, that depends on
how many parts I blow off

555
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,397
before he tells us
where the nymphs are.

556
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,790
You're too late.
My brother's found them already.

557
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,389
Oh, your brother. Where is he?

558
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,072
You know, we can just keep doing this,
but he's never gonna talk.

559
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,719
And then he's just gonna try
and fry us.

560
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,791
We'll have to dive out of the way,
get all dirty,

561
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,951
and we're just gonna end up
vanquishing him anyway.

562
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,475
- So should we just cut to the chase?
- I don't see why not.

563
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,995
No, wait. I'll tell you.

564
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,994
- Told you.
- Oh, man.

565
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,071
Now how are we gonna find Paige?

566
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,198
Well, we can just sit and wait
for his brother to come back.

567
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,713
I thought no one was supposed
to drink from the spring.

568
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,077
They're not.

569
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,428
At last.

570
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,788
Satyr, we should leave now.

571
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,554
Your satyr is dead, nymph.

572
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,591
My name is Tull,

573
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,392
brother of Xavier,

574
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,431
son of Nades.

575
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,876
And I will have our revenge.

576
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,553
That's right, nymph, be afraid.

577
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,109
There are no witches here now
to protect you.

578
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,032
Oh, no?

579
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,317
- Hurry, close the spring.
- No!

580
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,037
No. No!

581
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:52,911
Xavier. Xavier, where are you?

582
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,196
You're stepping on him.

583
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,873
What?

584
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:04,279
- No. No.
- Now, you should tell us

585
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:08,399
where our sister is, unless, of course,
you want to join your brother.

586
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,153
Throw it!

587
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,517
Paige calls that a potion?

588
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,551
If we kill him,
then how are we gonna find Paige?

589
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,278
What have you seen
in the last few minutes

590
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,118
that leads you to believe
we'll kill him?

591
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,953
- Just try it.
- Hang on.

592
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,394
Your powers have no effect on me.

593
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,754
I'm immortal now.

594
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,319
Arrogant.

595
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,396
Okay, run.

596
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,228
Paige!

597
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,755
- Oh, God, what if she's...
- Don't go there.

598
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,194
Paige!

599
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:12,193
You know, maybe we shouldn't be
calling for her. Maybe we should be...

600
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,152
- Yes.
- Daisy?

601
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,788
- Miranda?
- Don't be afraid.

602
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,310
Don't be afraid. You don't need a satyr
to tell you what to do anymore.

603
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,517
- Come on.
- We need you.

604
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,274
And helping us helps you,
remember?

605
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:31,318
- Come with us.
- Here we go.

606
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,071
Paige.

607
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:43,394
- She's bleeding.
- We have to call for Leo.

608
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,438
Here, I think this will help.

609
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,352
- What is that?
- Water from the Eternal Spring.

610
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,398
Wood nymphs wear a drop
to remind us of what we protect.

611
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,794
You all right?

612
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,072
Yeah, I'll be all right
if you tell me you got that bastard.

613
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,196
No!

614
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,272
Oh, I guess you didn't.

615
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,155
- He drank from the Spring.
- Yeah, we noticed.

616
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,197
You think you can
orb us out of here?

617
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,118
No, but maybe we don't have to.

618
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,317
If we can't vanquish him, maybe we
can turn him into something else

619
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,789
that's also immortal, like a tree.

620
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,634
Yes, even when they die, they're
reborn into new life and new growth.

621
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,997
Vengeance will be mine!

622
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,390
Piper, do you have any idea
what they're talking about?

623
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,879
- I think so.
- Good.

624
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:35,152
I will avenge my brother, Xavier!

625
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,710
<i>Changing seasons changes
All liFe renews as creation calls</i>

626
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,916
<i>Nothing is immune
Everything transmutes</i>

627
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,832
<i>So take this demon
And give him roots</i>

628
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,478
- That had to hurt.
- Nice job, sis.

629
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,959
You're not so bad yourself.

630
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,840
You know, you two make
a great one-two punch.

631
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,788
- Yeah, well, who's number one?
- We'll talk about that later.

632
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,110
Thank you for your help.

633
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:28,475
Told you you didn't need a satyr.

634
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,230
We don't know. We can't imagine
protecting the forest without him.

635
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,709
It's never been any other way.

636
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,950
Well, changes are good

637
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,912
for all of us.

638
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,838
He's so...

639
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,638
...innocent.

640
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:22,920
If he only had any idea what
Mommy and Auntie Paige did today.

641
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,959
They turned a very bad man
into a very big tree.

642
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,712
He's gonna have enough problems
growing up around me as it is.

643
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:37,111
Are you kidding me?
He is lucky to have you.

644
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,794
Yeah, well, lucky or not, he's got me.

645
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,951
I so missed
not being around him today.

646
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,878
Hello?

647
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,759
Sorry. You guys, I just wanted
to let you know

648
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,514
that I'm going out.

649
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,477
Trolling for satyrs, are we?

650
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:55,069
No, I'm not trolling.

651
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,629
I'm just gonna go out
with one of the guys in the band.

652
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,035
Oh, really?

653
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,668
Don't you think he's gonna be
expecting the wild child?

654
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,310
Never know, I might just have to give
him a little somethin'-somethin'.

655
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,156
Paige and I have decided to share
the responsibilities of head witch

656
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,834
so that I can spend more time
with Wyatt,

657
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,036
- and she can...
- Rock on.

658
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,431
Good night, you guys.

659
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,518
- Right, rock on.
- Don't do that.

660
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,954
- Rock on.
- Give it up, man.

661
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,348
- What?
- Give it up.

662
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,748
I'll show you give it up.

663
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,275
You give it up is what I'm saying.
Right now!

664
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,549
Your plant could use some water.

665
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,592
I'll get right on that.

666
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,559
I saw tomorrow's advance copy.

667
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,191
I noticed that you're running
the article.

668
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,509
Yes, I am.

669
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:50,752
And I also noticed
that Paige's name wasn't in it.

670
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,759
No, it isn't.

671
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,595
Thank you.

672
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,551
You know, it's ironic.

673
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,910
You were the one who was worried
about sleeping with the boss,

674
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:08,196
how it might affect your job.

675
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,557
Turns out it affected mine.

676
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,152
- How so?
- Well, I didn't buy this paper

677
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,278
to bury stories like this one,
Phoebe.

678
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,079
But that's basically what I just did.

679
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,355
I don't know what your sister's
involved in,

680
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,630
but the truth is, I...

681
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,430
I care about you too much
to cause you any hurt.

682
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,590
- That's not very professional of you.
- I know.

683
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,433
- Maybe you should fire you.
- Maybe.

684
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:44,070
I am still a little curious about what you
know of these Godiva girls, though.

685
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,435
Where they come from.

686
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,670
What happened to them.

687
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:51,952
You're not gonna tell me, are you?

688
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,994
I didn't think so.
