1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,750
Piper, did you check on the cake?

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,149
Yes.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,789
That's good, because I don't want
the cake to be delivered

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,228
till after the linens arrive.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,152
I checked on the cake.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,436
Could you please
take off that microphone?

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,359
Sorry, I'm just checking
the sound system.

8
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,830
What about the limo?
Honey, did you book the limo?

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,276
It's all taken care of,
along with the DJ, the caterer,

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,313
the table arrangements and the rice.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:34,034
Rice? No, no, we can't
throw rice.

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,828
- Why not?
- Because the birds can't digest it

13
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,959
- and they will blow up.
- Okay, so we'll throw birdseed

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,872
or we'll release balloons.

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,158
No, no. We can't release
balloons either, they float to the ocean.

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,709
And the whales mistake them
for squid and I can't be thinking

17
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,111
about whales washing up on the
beach during my wedding, you know?

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,918
Honey, I know you want
the perfect day,

19
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,957
but you need
to relax a little bit and breathe.

20
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,554
Breathing is good.
Breathing is your friend.

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,554
Whoa! Is this a wedding
or a coronation?

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,350
- Where is my dress?
- Oh, I don't have it.

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,112
I'm not breathing. What do you mean?
How could you forget my dress

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,714
the day before the wedding?
The bridal shop is closed tomorrow.

25
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,269
Relax, it's open tonight,
I'm planning on picking it up

26
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,113
- on my way to the rehearsal dinner.
- Oh, all right.

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,670
- Why don't we sit down?
- Yeah, sitting is good.

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,035
I think I'm a little stressed out.
You know, because I just,

29
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,399
I want tomorrow to be perfect.
No glitches, natural or supernatural.

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,710
No magic, no ghosts.

31
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,794
You guys understand that?

32
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,870
I just want tomorrow
to be nice and normal.

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,679
Honey, I promise you
will have your perfect wedding.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,311
By this time tomorrow, you and Cole
will be joined in holy matrimony.

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,792
Holy matrimony will be the worst
possible thing that could happen.

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,312
It'll keep you from
ever reigning as The Source.

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,635
That can't be right.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,228
It's what I foresee.

39
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,551
Unless, of course,
you cancel the wedding.

40
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,392
I can't. I need Phoebe.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,028
Yes, I can see that too.

42
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,793
We've been through this.

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,437
Cole's love for Phoebe still exists
within me, I can't overcome it.

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,909
If I'm to regain what I've lost,
it has to be with Phoebe.

45
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,959
- Marrying her.
- Even if it means losing your son?

46
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,513
A son?

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,515
- You saw a son in my future?
- More than a son.

48
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,319
You and Phoebe Halliwell
will produce the most powerful child

49
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,993
the magical world has ever seen.

50
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,874
- That's my boy.
- No, he won't be your boy.

51
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,157
He'll be theirs, on the side of good.

52
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,789
Unless you marry the witch
in a dark way.

53
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,510
Impossible, the wedding's tomorrow.
I don't have time.

54
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,671
Then your son will never be heir
to your kingdom.

55
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,273
He'll be heir to their destiny.

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,316
Not if I destroy the white wedding...

57
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,477
...then find a way to lure
her into a dark one.

58
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,438
I'll have to move quickly.
Start a fight between Phoebe

59
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,756
and one of her sisters. Paige.

60
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,876
Do you really think
sibling rivalry is going to--?

61
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,112
Not by itself, no. I'll have to get
a demon to attack, to distract them.

62
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:07,073
While you're doing that,

63
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:11,791
I'll set Paige up, mix a potion or two
to incite the infighting, then poof!

64
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,033
Watch the white wedding
disappear, literally.

65
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,078
Still, how will you get her
to marry you in the dark way?

66
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,313
What do I need for that?

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,431
A dark priest
to perform the ceremony

68
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,591
at night in a cemetery.

69
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,749
And of course, the groom
will have to drink her blood.

70
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,912
What are the chances of that?

71
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,789
Good.

72
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,312
Very good.

73
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,389
And what about Phoebe, who was
speedwalking down the aisle?

74
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,352
- I was not!
- You left your dad.

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,753
Okay, attention.

76
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:48,159
I have something for my groomsmen,
two fine gentlemen

77
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,198
I chose to stand by me
on the most important day of my life.

78
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,592
Because...

79
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,718
Well, they're the only ones I know.

80
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,271
Well, you have to admire
his honesty.

81
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,512
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

82
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,439
Engraved golf balls.

83
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,114
Titleist Pro V1 s. Thanks, man.

84
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,872
I don't golf.

85
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,589
- Hey, I'll take them.
- Well, they got my name on it.

86
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,789
So?

87
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,110
And for my two
beautiful bridesmaids...

88
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,600
...whom I chose because...

89
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,316
...they're my best friends
in the whole wide world.

90
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,995
Oh, Phoebe...

91
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,189
There's a bonsai tree
for balance and harmony.

92
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,716
And a dream catcher so that
all your dreams will come true,

93
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,518
just like mine have.

94
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,671
This is so great. Tarot cards!

95
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,354
My deck is totally trashed,
this is perfect.

96
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,712
That's just in case
you need psychic services

97
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,112
while me and my new husband
are busy getting busy.

98
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,270
Oh, I hope that's the photographer.

99
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,718
Hey, Leo, I got an extra stogie,
you wanna join me?

100
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,030
- I don't smoke.
- I'll take that.

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,631
But I do eat chocolate.

102
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,757
Leo, no, wait!

103
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,912
No, Leo!
You need to wait for everybody else.

104
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,311
Let's see what the future has
in store for Cole and Phoebe.

105
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,669
Oh, no.

106
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,196
You don't really believe
that stuff, do you?

107
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,597
Oh, I am so sorry. There's just
so many details, you know.

108
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,399
I practically bit Paige's head off
today at the church

109
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:47,755
because she didn't pick up
my dress on time.

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,309
Which is now in the attic. Yay!

111
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,029
Excuse me. I'll be right back.

112
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,118
So, what did the cards say?

113
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,032
Oh, nothing.

114
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,670
Try the cards again,
see what comes up.

115
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,231
Oh...maybe later.

116
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,634
So...

117
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,715
I don't mean to spoil anyone's fun,
but I should be going.

118
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,757
- Going where?
- Hotel.

119
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,911
Not supposed to stay in
the same house as my bride

120
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,718
the night before
before the wedding, right?

121
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,677
But Phoebe has the number
in case of emergency.

122
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,751
- Good night.
- See you later.

123
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:56,469
So, what are you gonna do
your last night as a single guy?

124
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,837
Oh, if I told you that,
you'd never marry me.

125
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,755
I feel like I'm standing
at the edge of a cliff right now.

126
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,988
- You do?
- Yeah.

127
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,791
And somehow I've never felt
safer in my whole life.

128
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,713
Are you okay?

129
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,308
No.

130
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,189
Not really.

131
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,598
You have no idea how difficult
you're making this for me.

132
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,274
I do.

133
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,599
But you have to go.

134
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,077
You'll have me soon enough.

135
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,593
I hope so.

136
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,598
I saw some witches poking around
this crypt one night

137
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,432
a couple or three years back.

138
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,917
- I think this is where they buried it.
- I can always count on you to help.

139
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,913
Well, you're one of the few left.

140
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,512
The dark priesthood's
a lonely calling these days.

141
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,237
I haven't seen a human soul
in my collection plate in months.

142
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,231
I'll be sure to make a donation.

143
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,839
Bless you, child.

144
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:37,276
You know, it's not a wise move
to unearth a Lazarus demon.

145
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,356
They're mean and unreliable.

146
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,032
- A bad combination.
- I know.

147
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,430
It's just that after you kill one,

148
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,154
you have to bury the remains
to prevent resurrection.

149
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,435
Yes. I know.

150
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,877
Well, what I wanna know is
what's a wise, old seer want

151
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,839
- with one of these messy creatures?
- That's my concern.

152
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,517
Don't you mean
The Source's concern?

153
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,314
I've heard the rumours.

154
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,233
A new Source has risen.

155
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,676
And lucky to have you as his seer.
Still, you've always worked

156
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,391
in a strictly advisory capacity.
Yet here you are digging up demons.

157
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,552
- So?
- So, what's in it for you?

158
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,909
I had a vision.

159
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,357
This Source will have a son.

160
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,034
The greatest power
in the history of magic.

161
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,236
And you'll be the hand
that rocks his cradle.

162
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,356
Once I get rid of his mother...

163
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,589
...yes.

164
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,158
Very nice.

165
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:54,073
Tell the new Source
I live to serve him.

166
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,148
- Hello.
- I had to call. It's an emergency.

167
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,719
Phoebe, what is it?

168
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,154
I needed to hear your voice.

169
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,199
I'm glad you called.

170
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,157
- You are?
- Yeah.

171
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,316
Something's been bothering me.

172
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,915
Maybe it's my imagination
but Paige was a little...

173
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,469
I don't know,
weird at dinner, kind of cold.

174
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,471
Really? I didn't notice.

175
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,029
I wouldn't bring it up,

176
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,839
but I don't wanna do anything
to come between you and your sister.

177
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,679
If us getting married is gonna hurt
the power of three in any way--

178
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,839
I don't know what to say.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,629
Except Paige has been nothing
but supportive of our marriage.

180
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,109
Forget about it. It's probably nothing.

181
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,395
Okay.

182
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,232
So how do you look
in your wedding gown?

183
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,432
I don't know yet, I've been too busy
to try it on.

184
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,633
Well, when you do, I want you
to picture me taking it off.

185
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,237
Gotta go, babe. Love you.

186
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,628
I love--

187
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,873
You.

188
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,274
Hey!

189
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,591
What is a wedding
without a bachelor party?

190
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,512
I got poker chips,
corn chips, I have chips.

191
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,672
I got the entertainment. From my
private collection, I might add.

192
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,877
You wouldn't happen to have
the key to the minibar, would you?

193
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,115
What does the future
have in store for Phoebe and Cole?

194
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,639
Piper.

195
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,034
Look, I can't keep this
to myself any longer.

196
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,875
This is Phoebe
and Cole's tarot reading.

197
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,191
They were lovers in their past,
despair fills their present...

198
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,757
...but this...

199
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,638
...is their future.

200
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,114
Oh, please.
This looks nothing like Death.

201
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,599
Prue met him, I know.

202
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,320
No, you're missing the point.
This is a bad omen.

203
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,551
Well, not necessarily.

204
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,269
Look, Cole's a nice guy,
fine, whatever, but face the facts.

205
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,510
He was the world's greatest demon
for what, a century?

206
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,989
Yeah, but we've been through that.

207
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,958
Yeah, I know. But a century's worth
of blood and bad karma,

208
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,872
you don't just walk away from that.

209
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,473
God, I don't know,
maybe I'm just...worried.

210
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,278
Well, have you ever considered

211
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,113
that maybe you drew those cards
because they represent your feelings

212
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,350
and not Phoebe's future?

213
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,432
That's a possibility.

214
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,792
- You!
- Oh!

215
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,871
You ruined my wedding!

216
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,553
And the bridal shop
is closed tomorrow.

217
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,430
Now, Phoebe, let's not
blow this out of proportion.

218
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,832
My wedding dress
could double as a circus tent.

219
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,719
Okay, I think things
are already out of proportion!

220
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,718
- All I did was pick up the dress.
- The wrong dress!

221
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,589
- No, I checked the tag.
- Oh, really? Let me just look at that.

222
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,192
"Millie Platt."

223
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,193
Do I look like Millie Platt to you?
Do l?

224
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,195
That's impossible.

225
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,908
Okay, you know, if you would have
picked up the dress

226
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,634
when I asked,
we'd have time to fix this.

227
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,074
Don't worry, I can sew.

228
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,199
I will take in the seams,
all of them, tonight.

229
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,874
Sword!

230
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,872
You'd better take care of this mess.

231
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,712
There must be something
in the Book.

232
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,869
Not the demon.

233
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,519
My wedding dress.

234
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,795
Are you hurt?

235
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,393
Baby, you're not supposed
to be here.

236
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,471
Leo said it was an urgent call,
I was worried.

237
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,591
Thanks, I'm fine.

238
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,078
No demon is gonna stop me
from marrying you tomorrow.

239
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,754
Now, my sister's another story.

240
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,553
I said I was sorry.

241
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,393
What kind of demon attacked you?

242
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,120
This one. "Lazarus demon"?

243
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,032
A Lazarus demon? You sure?

244
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,714
"Rare, high-level demons
with telekinetic powers."

245
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,751
Yep, that's the bad boy we popped.

246
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,714
Has it resurrected yet?

247
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,871
Resurrected?

248
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,229
Behind you!

249
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,829
Sofa!

250
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,309
No!

251
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,154
Piper, blow him up!

252
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,274
Leo.

253
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,399
Are you okay?

254
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,709
I think so, yeah.

255
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,553
He's gonna be back.
The Book says that Lazarus demons

256
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,188
get stronger the longer
they are out of cemetery ground.

257
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,748
Cemetery ground?

258
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,673
It's the only way to keep them
from resurrecting, you bury them.

259
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,593
So that means someone
intentionally dug him up...

260
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:42,194
...to attack us.
The night before my wedding.

261
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,635
Well, the question is, who and why?

262
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,394
I know why.
To stop the wedding.

263
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,636
I did two tarot readings, Phoebe.
They both said

264
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,870
that marrying Cole will only cause
death and despair.

265
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,556
- What?
- I'm surprised he didn't tell you.

266
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,312
He saw the first reading.

267
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,470
If I ran scared every time
things looked dark for us

268
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,272
we'd never have made it this far.

269
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,679
That's true.

270
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,351
Is there anything else
bothering you, Paige,

271
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,953
that I should know about?

272
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,879
No, not really.

273
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,037
Okay, good.

274
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,151
Paige and I will be on
demon watch tonight,

275
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,835
- so that Phoebe can get some sleep.
- I'm too wired to sleep.

276
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,197
Maybe I can help you relax with one
of my aromatherapy treatments.

277
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,752
See, now this is the spirit.

278
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,276
Everything will be fine,
as long as we stay together,

279
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,032
and stay calm.

280
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,516
I just did what the Seer told me.

281
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,709
Did she tell you to kill my fiancée?

282
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,118
Because that's what you almost did.

283
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,990
The Source before you
would've rewarded me

284
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,991
for killing one of those witches.

285
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,596
The old Source was reckless.

286
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,433
And now he's dead.

287
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,757
You wanna follow him to his grave?

288
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,394
No.

289
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,230
Then let's get this straight.

290
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,711
You work for me now.

291
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,918
Do what I tell you, I guarantee
you'll never see another cemetery.

292
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,833
But...

293
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,552
...hurt my bride again,
and I will bury you myself!

294
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,911
And stay down until I need you.

295
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,116
How dare you unearth
a Lazarus demon.

296
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,397
We need a creature that can lure
your witch into the cemetery.

297
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,549
But a Lazarus demon?

298
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,709
The witches must believe

299
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,950
they are under attack
for your plan to work.

300
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,917
There's no plan with Phoebe dead.

301
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,990
I'm beginning to wonder
if you can handle

302
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,390
your new mantle of power.

303
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,113
Are you questioning my leadership?

304
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:57,512
No. You inherited the world's evil.
I'll follow that anywhere.

305
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,673
- But...?
- Cole. He's still alive inside you.

306
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,399
And he loves the witch.

307
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,754
I know.

308
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,114
I can feel it.

309
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,432
When you were a demon,

310
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,751
his love for her ruined
more than one good plan.

311
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,552
It's different now.

312
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,838
Cole's voice used to scream inside
my head. Now it's just a whisper.

313
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,316
We can use his feelings
to control her.

314
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,112
So we'll take shifts,

315
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,317
and I will go first. And then Paige
will wake you up in the morning.

316
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,468
What is this?

317
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,749
My face cream,

318
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:46,718
also known as "Heaven in a Jar."
It's a special blend.

319
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,108
You made it?

320
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,198
It's got patchouli oil
for balance and confidence,

321
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,920
and chamomile
to relax your nervous system.

322
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,435
I'm really sorry
about your wedding dress.

323
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,870
I want everything to go
so great for you tomorrow.

324
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,594
It's okay.

325
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,514
- She is trying.
- Yeah, I know.

326
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,954
Couldn't hurt, right?

327
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,593
You still feeling tense?

328
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,071
Not really tense, just...

329
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,756
...extremely alert.

330
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,149
Phoebe, I know you want
the Cinderella fantasy.

331
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,552
But I don't want you to be upset

332
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,917
if everything doesn't go
exactly as planned tomorrow.

333
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,633
Where is that coming from?

334
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,115
Well, I was just remembering
my wedding day.

335
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,875
And I remember I wanted
everything to be absolutely perfect.

336
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:46,510
And then Prue crashed through
the front door on a Harley!

337
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:51,748
Yeah, only Prue could make
my wedding day all about her.

338
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:57,911
But the point is,
I barely remember the ceremony.

339
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,078
It's a total blur.

340
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:04,635
And in the end, all that matters is
that you marry the guy that you love.

341
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,030
And if you manage to do that,

342
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,270
your wedding was perfect.

343
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,597
What are you doing in here?

344
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,509
Just checking on Phoebe.
You were in the bathroom.

345
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,037
I didn't even hear you.

346
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:17,918
Well, that's a problem,
don't you think?

347
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,389
- What if I was a demon?
- Oh, good point.

348
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,198
When you're on
demon watch in this house,

349
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:24,828
- you don't take bathroom breaks.
- Got it.

350
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,038
And whatever you do,
don't fall asleep.

351
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,711
Paige. Paige!

352
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,791
You were supposed to wake me up.

353
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,591
What happened? What time is it?

354
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,519
Look at me!

355
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,111
What do you have to
say for yourself?

356
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,918
I fixed your wedding dress?

357
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,354
Paige!

358
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,151
This is all your fault!
You put a mojo on my face cream.

359
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,829
I did not!
Those are all natural ingredients.

360
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,117
If you had something to say to me,
why didn't you just say it, Paige?

361
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,748
Okay, we all just need
to just take a deep breath--

362
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,480
- Say what?
- Don't think that I don't know

363
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,517
how you really feel about Cole.

364
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,399
Oh! I have been nothing
but supportive of that demon.

365
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,868
Ex-demon.

366
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,439
Oh, is that like "ex-convict"?

367
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,478
All right, that is not necessary.

368
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,119
We all just need to calm down--

369
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,032
Face it, Phoebe,
this wedding has been filled

370
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,156
with nothing but bad omens
from the start.

371
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,595
And they all seem to be
connected with you now, don't they?

372
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,955
All right, that's it!

373
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,549
Break it up. You go back
to your corner, and you...

374
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,354
You're gonna get ready.

375
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,949
And we're gonna put
lots and lots of makeup on you.

376
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,351
Face it. There's not enough spackle
in the world to fill those craters.

377
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:35,239
- Step back.
- Oh, now what are you doing?

378
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,119
Trying to prove to you that I am not
trying to sabotage your wedding.

379
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,555
- I don't think--
- Let the object of objection

380
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,796
Become but a dream,
As I cause the seen to be unseen

381
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,072
Magic, she just did magic on me.

382
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,791
And it's working.

383
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,791
It is?

384
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,032
My zits are gone?

385
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,028
Yeah, I can...

386
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,795
...honestly say that your face
is completely clear.

387
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,916
It is my wedding day. The one day
of my life that is all about me,

388
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,156
and nobody can see me.

389
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,199
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to do it.

390
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,197
Stop following me. Go away!

391
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,920
Hang on, Phoebe. Don't lose it now.

392
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,152
Here. You can't walk around naked,
and I think it'll fit now.

393
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,153
Paige! What difference
does it make? I am invisible.

394
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,629
My wedding is supposed to start
in less than one hour

395
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,597
and everyone I've ever known
is gonna be there.

396
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:38,557
And I'm never gonna be able
to face them again.

397
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,038
All right, this is all just a backfire
to the vanishing spell.

398
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,038
There's gotta be a reversal in here.

399
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,351
Hey, what's going on up here?
You guys aren't even dressed yet.

400
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,033
Where's Phoebe?

401
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,030
She is still putting on her face.

402
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,991
I can't keep stalling
this photographer forever.

403
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,037
He's done portraits in every room
in the house.

404
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,918
Send him ahead to the church.

405
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,476
- Phoebe?
- That was me.

406
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,437
I'm working on my impressions.

407
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,036
Dad, go downstairs
and wait for us there.

408
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,555
See? I'm working it into the toast.

409
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,039
Oh, what's the use?

410
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,031
I might as well call Cole
and tell him it's off.

411
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,629
- Oh, honey...
- Something you said

412
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,071
is bothering me. Why would there be
a backfire to the vanishing spell?

413
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,918
Personal gain, I guess.

414
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,718
But there wasn't any of that
when I used it

415
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,949
to help others, why Phoebe?

416
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,237
What, are you suggesting that there
is outside magic at play here?

417
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:42,278
Yeah, the same magic
that dug up the Lazarus demon,

418
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,637
and then there was the acne,
then the super-sized wedding dress.

419
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,836
She's rambling.
Should I yell at her again?

420
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,116
No! She might be onto something.

421
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:52,794
Listen, we're not fighting
each other here, we're fighting evil.

422
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,393
We kick evil's ass every day.

423
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,993
- Sometimes twice a day.
- Okay.

424
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:59,596
Today's a day like any other day.
Evil wants this wedding cancelled?

425
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,319
Screw that.

426
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,038
We're not gonna go
down without a fight.

427
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,838
Okay, so, what we do
is we get dressed,

428
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,040
we head to the church,
while we look for a way to fix Phoebe.

429
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,714
- Are you with me?
- Yes. Phoebe...

430
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,950
Grab the Book, let's go.

431
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,679
Get the dress.

432
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,679
The wedding was supposed to start
1 5 minutes ago. Where are the girls?

433
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:38,638
Phoebe needs to talk to you
in the dressing room.

434
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,268
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

435
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,510
I don't think that
that's gonna be a problem.

436
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,032
Okay, this one's gotta work.
It's the spell that reversed

437
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,760
my enhanced breasts. Here.

438
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:00,635
Guiding spirits, hear our plea
Annul this magic, let it be

439
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,832
Can you see me?

440
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,192
Not even your breasts.

441
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,960
Well, that's it.
It's the last reversal spell we have.

442
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:17,716
It's okay, you guys.
You did your best.

443
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,152
Come on, let's go.

444
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,509
We'll leave you two alone to talk.

445
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,638
Wait a minute, where's Phoebe?

446
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,592
Over here.

447
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,598
- Hi, honey.
- Phoebe?

448
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,512
- You're invisible?
- Yeah.

449
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,831
Looks like whatever demon's
trying to stop our wedding succeeded.

450
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,072
- Oh, honey...
- We tried every trick we know to fix it.

451
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,992
And nothing's worked. And now...

452
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,315
Phoebe?

453
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,078
I wanted the perfect wedding.

454
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,713
But I didn't want it for me.
I wanted it for you.

455
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,239
You've given me so much.
You don't deserve this.

456
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,597
It's okay, baby.

457
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,151
- We'll find another way, I promise.
- Okay.

458
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,832
- I'll make the announcement.
- All right.

459
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,878
- The wedding's off.
- Not necessarily.

460
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,791
Get everybody in their positions.

461
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,713
We'll start with the processional,
tell the quartet.

462
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,918
What about Phoebe?
She's invisible.

463
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,351
Not for long, we hope, so go on.

464
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,988
And look for your bride
walking down the aisle.

465
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:40,989
Go on.

466
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:46,195
Wait.

467
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,271
Hold on here. I'm a little confused.

468
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,759
I thought we were out of spells.

469
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,836
Not yet. You know how
every attempt we've made

470
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,877
to reverse your invisibility
has failed?

471
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,155
Yes.

472
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,276
Well, what if we don't reverse it,
we just shift it

473
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,873
- from one sister to another?
- Wait.

474
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,235
You mean transfer
the invisibility to you?

475
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,879
No way, I won't let you.

476
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,873
Phoebe, every Cinderella
needs a fairy godmother.

477
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,439
Let me be yours.

478
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,629
- Paige.
- Please.

479
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,153
I need to do this so you know

480
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,992
that I am not trying
to stop your wedding.

481
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,592
The natives are growing
restless in there.

482
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,352
Yeah, I know.
A couple have already left.

483
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,953
Will somebody tell me
what's going on?

484
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,553
I wish I knew.

485
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,712
Places, everybody.

486
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,156
Aren't you going to seat me?

487
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,752
- I'll get her.
- No, allow me.

488
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,599
You should wait for Phoebe.

489
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,111
- They'll recognize you.
- You never contacted me.

490
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,032
- Did your potion work?
- Yes.

491
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,350
And did they use the spell
you thought they would?

492
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,078
Yes, and now she's invisible.

493
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,549
Then why are all these people here?

494
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,637
I think they found a spell
to reverse our magic.

495
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:07,671
And did she find an obedience spell
to make you do as she pleases?

496
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,870
Don't forget who you're talking to.

497
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,159
Where's the Lazarus demon?

498
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,709
In my chambers,
awaiting your command.

499
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,433
Order him to attack.

500
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,797
The girls will stop the ceremony
to save innocent lives.

501
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,593
Where's Paige?

502
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,434
I don't know.

503
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,671
I'm gonna cry.

504
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,592
Please be seated.

505
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,798
Thank you all for coming
to honour the love

506
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,349
between Cole Turner
and Phoebe Halliwell.

507
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,630
Before we get started,
I must ask, is there anyone

508
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,469
who has just cause why this couple
should not be united in marriage?

509
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,871
This is your time, your platform.

510
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,511
Speak now, or forever
hold your peace.

511
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,470
I'll check that out. Keep going.

512
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,430
Since nobody here
can show just cause

513
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,272
it's my privilege to ask--

514
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,476
You put her down!

515
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,428
Excuse me.

516
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,149
Keep going, please.
Just keep going.

517
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,869
As I was saying,

518
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,271
it's my privilege to ask who gives
this woman to this man today?

519
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,638
Her sisters and I do.

520
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,717
Son of a bitch!

521
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,278
Piper, look out!

522
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,515
Stop!

523
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,833
Where's Paige?

524
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,034
I don't know.

525
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:23,669
Leo, where's Paige?

526
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,511
I can't get a read on her.

527
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,756
Wherever she is,
her heart's not beating.

528
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:32,312
Over here.

529
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,235
What the hell is going on in here?

530
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,950
That's it. The wedding is off!

531
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:49,038
Tell everyone to get out of here.
Go, go!

532
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,158
Just send the food to the house.

533
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,999
Yes, and the bill.

534
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,191
Not as sorry as I am. Thank you.

535
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,193
Caterer's taken care of.

536
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,318
Thank you so much, Piper, I just...
I can't deal with any of that right now.

537
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,072
It's okay. It's been a tough day.

538
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,836
How about you, how are you doing?

539
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,638
I'm still a little shaky.

540
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:23,835
We nearly lost you.

541
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,797
Lucky the demon hesitated
when Cole yelled.

542
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,472
Yeah, but why did he?

543
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,035
Maybe he was surprised
somebody yelled at him.

544
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,755
We should all just be thankful
that we're alive.

545
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,469
And visible.

546
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,153
Although I'm not sure
how that happened.

547
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:40,278
I do. The magic you were under
was supposed to stop the wedding.

548
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,158
It wore off once the wedding
was cancelled.

549
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,753
Oh, you mean when evil won?

550
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,551
I am not stopping until I find out
who sent that thing after us.

551
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,151
Speaking of the demon...

552
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,318
...the crispy critter needs to find
its way back to a cemetery.

553
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:56,674
Well, I know a local haunt.
I can take it there.

554
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,235
And what happens
when my freeze wears off on the way?

555
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,431
You'll be as defenceless
as a cat toy.

556
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,589
I'll go with him.

557
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,869
I wanna make sure
it's in the ground for good.

558
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,839
Let's all do it.

559
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,353
Fine by me.

560
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,712
I found a spot.

561
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,911
This headstone's
from the early 1 900s.

562
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,031
Nobody will come digging
here anytime soon.

563
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,719
Piper, if you see anyone coming,

564
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,559
freeze them.

565
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,834
Don't worry, honey. It took Leo
and me three times to get married.

566
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,479
It'll happen for you and Cole.

567
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,111
We just need to figure out what kind
of evil stopped your wedding and why.

568
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,039
I have an idea.

569
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,589
Why don't we just ask it?

570
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,028
Oh, don't be crazy.

571
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,312
That Lazarus demon
is a time bomb waiting to explode.

572
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:55,392
No, I wanna know who ruined
the happiest day of my life.

573
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,593
Phoebe, I'm asking you please,
for me. Don't do this.

574
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:08,398
Cole, I can't believe
you don't wanna know.

575
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,918
One flinch, and I blow you
into briquettes.

576
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,871
Who resurrected you?

577
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,233
Ask him.

578
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:36,152
You swore I'd never see
a cemetery again if I helped you.

579
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,079
You set me up!

580
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,589
Cole, what is this demon
talking about?

581
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,834
I have no idea.

582
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:47,072
Liar! You ordered me
to attack them in the church.

583
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,913
Is this how you reward
your loyal servants?

584
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,630
Okay, Cole, what is going on?

585
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,916
Because I gotta tell you
right now, I am freaking out!

586
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,956
Oh, what's the point,
you already figured it out.

587
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,039
No, it can't be.

588
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,194
No. It can't be. No...

589
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,000
It's not. It's the Seer.

590
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,076
- Not for long.
- No, don't.

591
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,514
Where's Cole?

592
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,555
Unconscious in the mausoleum.

593
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,750
Why would you save us one day
and try to kill us the next?

594
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,399
For the same reason.

595
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,915
To keep the balance of power
between good and evil.

596
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,714
Don't be cryptic. I hate cryptic.

597
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:40,316
I had a vision.
If you married Cole on this day

598
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:43,995
his love would have helped you
evolve into a much stronger witch.

599
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,310
Too strong. I had to stop you.

600
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,398
And I did.

601
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,197
- Bitch!
- Cole...

602
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,032
Go, I'll bury the rest
of the demon.

603
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,788
Cole!

604
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:29,158
It was the Seer.
She's in the cemetery.

605
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,035
Yeah, we know. We had a little chat.

606
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,519
I'm surprised she didn't kill you.

607
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,434
That's not her style.
Killing's beneath her.

608
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:39,551
She only does it if she has to.

609
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,312
Come on, let's get you home.

610
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,873
You okay?

611
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,719
I still don't understand,
if the Seer wanted to stop Phoebe

612
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,678
from marrying you,
wouldn't she want to kill you?

613
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,472
I don't know,
you'd have to ask the Seer.

614
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,232
Look, a chapel.

615
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:01,791
- A chapel in a mausoleum?
- That's a first.

616
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,639
It's cute.

617
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,432
And perfect.

618
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:06,953
For what?

619
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,113
A wedding.

620
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,110
I couldn't agree more.

621
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,435
Really?

622
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,953
You've got the rings.

623
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,235
And we're all here.

624
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,520
Okay, I do. I mean...

625
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:24,238
I will. Let's go!

626
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,073
Not two but one...

627
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,477
...till life be gone.

628
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,038
You may kiss the bride.

629
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,399
We did it.

630
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,352
Yes, we did.

631
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,952
It is done.
