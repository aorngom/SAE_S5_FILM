1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,953
We're hanging white gauze curtains
to give this place flavour, you know?

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,270
Then we'll take out
these tables over here,

3
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,635
replace them with mounds of pillows
so people can lay back,

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,631
get comfortable.
You look worried, baby girl.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,517
Treat, I know I gave you the authority
to make some changes in the club.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,557
But I thought they would
happen gradually.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,358
You know, I don't
wanna shock the regulars.

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,398
Well, I do. All right?
Your place seems too safe.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,595
Now, do you trust me?

10
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:27,558
Do you trust the number one
club promoter in all of San Francisco?

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,472
- Yes, of course.
- Good.

12
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,279
All right, guys. Rip it all out.

13
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,668
Wait a minute.

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,831
What's going on? That's our table.

15
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,670
Who told them that they
could rip out our table?

16
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,796
- I did.
- And who are you?

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,589
Phoebe, this is Treat Taylor.
He's the new manager at P3.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,596
- I'm sorry, the new what?
- I just hired him on a trial basis.

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,830
Well, isn't that interesting.

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,071
I need to talk to you.

21
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,270
You look worried, baby girl.

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,953
Well, why didn't you
tell me about this?

23
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,599
It just happened yesterday,

24
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,433
which is why I asked you
to come down here today.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,477
We said we weren't gonna do this.

26
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,228
- Do what?
- Make any major changes in our lives.

27
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:17,234
All the books caution against it
after you've suffered a major loss.

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:21,518
Do not sell the house, do not
get married, do not quit your job.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,797
Okay, but like it or not,
there's been a lot of changes lately.

30
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,235
And this is hardly the biggest.

31
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,710
Speak of the devil/whitelighter/witch.

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,279
- Hi, guys.
- Hi.

33
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,000
- Hope I'm not interrupting.
- No, no. We were just talking.

34
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,758
Well, I have a quick question,
but it can wait. Continue.

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,990
I was just explaining to Phoebe

36
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,833
that the changes I'm making
in the club are not by choice.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,115
They are by necessity.

38
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,396
Okay, P3 has been
struggling a little lately.

39
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,393
And we are now
a single salary household.

40
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,790
Well, we don't have to be.
I can get a job.

41
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,000
And if you could get a part-time,
entry-level job

42
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,357
that pays you about 200 grand a year,
that would really make a difference.

43
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,796
Otherwise, I'd rather you
be free for "other work."

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,712
- About that other work--
- But it's not fair.

45
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,233
You shouldn't carry financial burden.

46
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,118
I will worry about the source
of our income

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,998
if you worry about
the source of all evil.

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,479
Speaking of evil--

49
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,676
Besides, what kind of job
would you get?

50
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,229
Well, I am a college grad.
I am sure I could find something.

51
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,790
- I found something.
- Okay, Paige, what is it?

52
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,676
Okay, have you guys
ever walked by a house

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,593
and just got a really bad,
creepy feeling from it?

54
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,877
Okay, on my way to get coffee
every morning,

55
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,431
I walk by this house
and I get this shiver.

56
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,908
- A shiver?
- Does that mean anything?

57
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,389
It's a shiver.

58
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,949
No, I've always dismissed it
as a bad case of the creeps.

59
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,634
But now that I'm a witch...

60
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,676
I don't know, I think it might
be something supernatural.

61
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,398
Well, do you know anything
about the house?

62
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,197
Just that this cute guy
named Finn lives there.

63
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,239
We bumped into each other
at the grocery store, flirted a little.

64
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,675
Done the "Are these
melons ripe?" thing. Okay.

65
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,150
Well, that sounds like you
have the hots, not the creeps.

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,953
- No--
- Well, either way,

67
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,395
I think it's a good idea that you
stay away from this Finn guy.

68
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:11,438
No, I don't get the shiver
from him, just the house.

69
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,113
I think I'm onto something.

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,555
I really think that when you've
been a witch for a few months,

71
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,871
you'll know the difference between
sensing evil and needing a jacket.

72
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,395
- So you don't want to check it out?
- Not anytime soon.

73
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,316
- Phoebe, I'm not making this up.
- Oh, I know you're not, sweetie.

74
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:31,710
But you gotta admit,
it's not a lot to go on.

75
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,189
- I gotta run. I'll call you later?
- Okay.

76
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,635
Okay.

77
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,439
Stay away from that Finn guy.

78
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,157
- Jeez, Finn, you live here?
- It needs some work.

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,792
Okay, it needs a lot of work.

80
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,679
But it's nicer inside. I'll show you.

81
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,913
- I must be out of my mind.
- Why?

82
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,913
I don't know. Going home
with a guy I just met.

83
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,631
Come on. What are you afraid of?

84
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,193
Keep meaning to get that fixed.

85
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,351
It's kind of dark in here, Finn.

86
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,353
A little old to be scared
of the dark, aren't you?

87
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,190
Maybe I should go
check the circuit breaker.

88
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,476
Wait, don't go.

89
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,918
It's okay.

90
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,589
Who's there?

91
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,712
If I'm reading this correctly,

92
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,838
you were 27 years old
when you finished college.

93
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,511
Yes, I just graduated last spring.

94
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,636
That certainly took a while.

95
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,360
Oh, I had to take a break
after my freshman year.

96
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,029
Personal reasons.

97
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,998
- Would you care to elaborate?
- Not really.

98
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:09,431
You know, during the holidays,
things get pretty hectic around here.

99
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,672
We need people who
can handle tense situations.

100
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,469
Oh, believe me, I am uniquely qualified
to handle any kind of pressure.

101
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,073
I have battled more...

102
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,433
...customer complaints than--
Than you can possibly ever imagine.

103
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,672
I see you also noted that you
require a flexible work schedule.

104
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,672
I'll put in the hours, I promise.

105
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,833
It's just sometimes I may
just have to leave unexpectedly.

106
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,508
Would you care to elaborate?

107
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,435
No, not really.

108
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,794
I see.

109
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,520
- It's not what you're thinking.
- And you know what I'm thinking?

110
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,954
I don't know what you're thinking.

111
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,111
I just know that whatever
you're thinking, it's not it.

112
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,748
- So you're not gonna tell me?
- No, it's just so silly.

113
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,031
No.

114
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,999
Hello?

115
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,071
Is anybody home?

116
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,752
Leo.

117
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,436
Oh, God, are you okay?

118
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,919
I knocked but nobody answered.

119
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,152
- And the door was unlocked.
- It usually is.

120
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,950
Otherwise, demons come crashing
through and costs a fortune to fix.

121
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,517
If you're looking for Phoebe,
she's not here. She's at a job interview.

122
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,353
- Actually I was looking for you.
- Me? Why?

123
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:31,990
Well, seeing that you're a whitelighter
and I'm part-whitelighter,

124
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:35,869
I was hoping we could have a
"whitelighter to part-whitelighter" chat.

125
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,828
Sure. Of course, sit down.

126
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,474
So you have the ability
to locate your charges, right?

127
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,148
Sometimes.

128
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,995
And if you had a sixth sense
for locating good,

129
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,833
is it possible that I have one
for locating evil?

130
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,228
You think you sensed evil?

131
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,910
I know it sounds silly, but there's
this house that I walk by,

132
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,958
and I get this really bad feeling from.

133
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,675
Problem is, I've already discussed it
with Piper and Phoebe,

134
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,068
and they've dismissed it.

135
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,993
So you want me to talk to them.

136
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,559
I hate to put you in the middle.

137
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,031
Oh, that's part of my job.

138
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,875
I'll just talk to them when I sense
their minds are in the right spot.

139
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,359
Thank you.

140
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,474
Damn it.

141
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,596
Now would not be a good time.

142
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,069
I am only gonna say this once.

143
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,909
The real world better start
showing me some respect,

144
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,752
otherwise, I'm gonna
stop saving it every week.

145
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,036
- What happened?
- I just had the worst job interview

146
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,919
for a position that a monkey could fill,
provided the monkey could explain

147
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,150
why it needed flexible work hours.
Why aren't you at work?

148
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,356
I-- It's my lunch break. I just--

149
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,034
You're not still talking about
the creepy house, are you?

150
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,872
Did you find out
any new information?

151
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,357
I think it's worth checking out.

152
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,557
Okay. Well, let's go.

153
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,836
I mean, it's not like I have
to be at work or anything.

154
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,997
Yeah, but I do.

155
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,276
Could we meet afterwards? Like 4?

156
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,237
I'll give you the address, I just--

157
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,152
I need...

158
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,117
...pen and paper.

159
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,511
I love being able
to move stuff with my mind.

160
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,799
I'll see you there later.

161
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,872
- Leo, thanks.
- Sure.

162
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,119
You really think she's
onto something?

163
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,998
Well, the important thing
is that she does,

164
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,549
so I think we should support that.

165
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:19,713
Okay. Well, then I'll go change into
my work clothes and head over there.

166
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,758
Do you want me to go with you?
You don't even know what's there.

167
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,672
Leo, please.

168
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,796
This is what I do.

169
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,270
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

170
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,552
You're changing
the name of the club?

171
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,229
I mean, you know,
that's the plan, you know.

172
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,799
What's wrong with P3?

173
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,960
Well, we polled people. Most of them
thought it was a parking level.

174
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,236
I mean, I don't even know
what it stands for.

175
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,789
It stands for Prue,
Piper and Phoebe.

176
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,111
We are P3. We were.

177
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,717
Yeah, but check this out.

178
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,189
See, the new image
deserves a new name, you know.

179
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,157
I mean, otherwise no one
will know what it is.

180
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,880
You know what I'm saying? If you're
against it, I can take it all down,

181
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,076
- change things, whatever you want.
- No. No, it's just--

182
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,595
It's just another change.

183
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,354
- So do what you want.
- You cool?

184
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,919
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You cool? You cool?

185
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,069
All right.

186
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,234
Come on, Phoebe,
show a little spine.

187
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,472
Hello?

188
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,716
Anybody home?

189
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,271
No.

190
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,677
Where are you?

191
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,999
You can't have gone that far.

192
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,352
Leo.

193
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,839
Leo.

194
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,719
I see you.

195
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,912
Why, you little witch.

196
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,470
We'll see how long you last.

197
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,635
Oh, this sucks.

198
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,712
I can't get used to this orbing thing.

199
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,393
You will. You got it in you.

200
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,438
I feel like my stomach's
gonna come out of me.

201
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,274
What's with the white gauze?
It's worse than up there.

202
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,556
It was Treat's idea.
What are you guys doing here?

203
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,359
- We orbed in.
- Together?

204
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,238
Yeah, well, we were
worried about Phoebe.

205
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,960
She was supposed to meet me at the
creepy house, but she never showed.

206
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,396
So I thought maybe she got hung up,
so I went to your place.

207
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,791
I thought we decided not to investigate
the so-called creepy house.

208
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,159
Well, I know you didn't think
it was anything. But Leo...

209
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,878
So you went behind my back
and asked Leo.

210
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,558
She didn't go behind your back,
and I'm her whitelighter too.

211
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,517
Right. Well, it's a smart thing
to do as a witch,

212
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,875
but an annoying thing
to do as a sister.

213
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,632
So, what happened to Phoebe?

214
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,076
I don't know. I checked my radar
but she dropped to the tiniest blip.

215
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,037
And what would account for that?

216
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,952
I don't know, but I don't like it.

217
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,680
Well, then we should
probably get over there.

218
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:39,229
See, I told you something
was going on in that house.

219
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,551
Okay, let's hold the congratulations
till we find Phoebe.

220
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,037
Look out.

221
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,349
- You all right?
- Piper.

222
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:51,953
Yeah, man.

223
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,715
Doesn't matter.
P3 doesn't exist anymore.

224
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,479
Come out.

225
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,555
Watch out. One's loose.
Shut the door.

226
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,919
Shut it.

227
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,397
What are you gonna do with her
when you find her?

228
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,549
Don't ask questions.

229
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,399
Same thing you did
with the other one?

230
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,549
I said...

231
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,316
Don't ask questions.

232
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,912
The other one.

233
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,559
Still, that--

234
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,711
That gives me an idea.

235
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,956
Do you want me to--?

236
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,035
Help me.

237
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,192
Door's still open. Shut it.

238
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,233
Shut.

239
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,518
There it is. See?

240
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,953
Shiver.

241
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,032
Well, Paige, you don't
have to be a super-witch

242
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,191
to know that that house is creepy.

243
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,430
I saw a motorcycle in the driveway.
Somebody's home.

244
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,436
Okay, so I say we go up to the
front door, you knock, and I will freeze.

245
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,989
You don't always have control
over your powers.

246
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,479
You might be blowing up
an innocent.

247
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,479
Okay, so how about you orb in,
check out the place

248
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,596
- and tell us what we're up against.
- I have an idea--

249
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,909
Well, the problem with that is,

250
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,911
what if what we're dealing with
is not supernatural?

251
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,038
Then I've orbed into somebody's
living room and we've risked exposure.

252
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,236
- If I just--
- This is why I say go with the freeze.

253
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,073
- I can get Finn out of the house.
- How?

254
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,389
Well, I know the guy.

255
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,189
I'll just go in, lure him out,
and you can go in and snoop around.

256
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,999
No. We can't let you
go off with a potential demon.

257
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,116
It's too dangerous. Right, Leo?

258
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,038
Actually, it sounds like our best bet.

259
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,669
Are you siding with Paige now?

260
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:45,157
Hey, there's no sides.
And, yes.

261
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,475
Look, I know I'm new to magic,
but the only way to change that

262
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,039
is to allow me
to get some experience.

263
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,111
I am just trying to protect you.

264
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,999
That's nice, but your protecting me
may be hurting Phoebe.

265
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,636
Now, I got her into this,

266
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,119
Iet me help get her out of it.

267
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,753
Okay, fine. Go.

268
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,514
But until we know who this
Finn guy is and what he does,

269
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,114
I do not want you alone with him.
Take him to P3.

270
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,714
Or, I mean, The Spot.

271
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,108
Got it.

272
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,952
- What is that for?
- A lure.

273
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,594
Do not go into that house.

274
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,718
Did you hear me?
I said, do not go in.

275
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,829
It is like talking to a wall.

276
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,355
She's got the Halliwell hearing.

277
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,590
That's one good thing
about being so small.

278
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,036
I'm so light I can kind of fly.

279
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,878
Can you talk?

280
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,479
Okay.

281
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,271
Just close your eyes.

282
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,033
And don't tense up.

283
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,278
No, no. You can collapse later.

284
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,032
- I need you to run. Can you do that?
- Yeah.

285
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,633
We gotta go
before Gammill sees us.

286
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,549
Gotcha.

287
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,950
I knew a witch could never resist
saving an innocent.

288
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,190
- Hello?
- Now what?

289
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,157
- Hello?
- Another girl.

290
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,629
Get her inside. Go. Get her.

291
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,075
- Get her!
- Maybe we should just let them all go.

292
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,030
Since when did you
develop a conscience?

293
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,188
I never gave you one.

294
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,394
Now, what are you
standing around for? Go.

295
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:45,472
Go. Fetch.

296
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,078
Be quiet.

297
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,314
- Hi.
- Hi.

298
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,675
Remember me?
The girl with the melons?

299
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:21,913
From the supermarket melons.

300
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,399
Yeah, I remember.

301
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,673
What brings you here?

302
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,469
Let's just say I got tired of waiting
for you to show up on my doorstep.

303
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,835
- I'm sorry?
- Look, if we're gonna go out,

304
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,719
the first thing you need to know
about me is that I don't play games.

305
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,834
I see what I want, and l...

306
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,238
...go for it.

307
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,193
Do you have a problem with that?

308
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,552
Are you always this
aggressive with guys?

309
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,558
Just the ones I like.

310
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,875
Why don't you come in.

311
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,069
Is something wrong?

312
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,999
Oh, just the old cliché:

313
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,516
My mother told me never to go
into stranger's houses. That thing.

314
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,999
Come on.

315
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,554
What are you afraid of?

316
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,838
Don't do it.

317
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,157
Do it.

318
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,513
No, wait.

319
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,792
On second thought, let's just go out.

320
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,150
The lure worked.

321
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,671
Barely.

322
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,392
Now where were we?

323
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,832
Piper! Piper, I'm--!

324
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:08,471
You go that way. I'll go this way.

325
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,831
In here! I'm in here!

326
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,072
Oh, weird.

327
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,829
Bizarre collection.

328
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,952
I wouldn't touch. We should look
for Phoebe. I'll check upstairs.

329
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,952
Piper!

330
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,717
Piper.

331
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,879
There's nothing upstairs.
I mean nothing.

332
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,712
Anything down here?

333
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,075
No. Nothing but a bunch of clay.

334
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,470
I think we should get out of here.
Check the Book of Shadows.

335
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,870
I-- I want to know
what we're dealing with.

336
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,234
Well, whatever it is,

337
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,710
it better not require
the power of three to vanquish it.

338
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,393
Well, well. The power of three.

339
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,994
So you're not just a witch
but a Charmed One.

340
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,709
Nothing will make me happier
than to collect you all.

341
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,949
When your clay hardens,
I'll fire up the kiln.

342
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,796
And once you're in the kiln,
there'll be nothing left to save.

343
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,153
Don't worry.

344
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,949
I'll be back once I complete
my collection.

345
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,359
Okay, good.

346
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,034
Now that he's gone, I can focus
on getting us out of here.

347
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,229
Although, I do have to tell you,
I'm not having the best day of my life.

348
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,712
It began with an interview where
a woman made me feel this big.

349
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,431
And now I actually am this big.
And next up is being baked.

350
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:57,396
Well, that's just my roundabout
way of saying, "Don't panic."

351
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,755
I'm gonna get us out of here.

352
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,196
I'm...

353
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,998
...going...

354
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,111
...to turn...

355
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:12,319
...this day around.

356
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,509
Found him.

357
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,557
"Gammill, a.k.a. 'The Collector'

358
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,109
is known for his passion
of collecting one-of-a-kind figurines."

359
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,396
Wonder what he gets out of that.

360
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,710
Well, speaking for my great-aunt,
Sylvia, who collects Hummels,

361
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,950
when they have a hard time
dealing with real people,

362
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,634
figurines can be their best friends.

363
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,075
Yeah, but being socially
awkward doesn't land you

364
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,834
- in the Book of Shadows.
- So, what does?

365
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,319
Well, apparently he went up against
a witch some time in the '70s.

366
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,750
A spell was cast to make him
as hideous on the outside

367
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,434
as he was on the inside.
Like this, I suppose.

368
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,238
Does it say what he did
to deserve that?

369
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,799
No, it doesn't make
any sense either.

370
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:52,315
I mean, we saw this guy,
and he still looks the same.

371
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,278
So, what does that mean?

372
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,477
That Gammill found a way to break the
curse and changed his name to Finn?

373
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,200
I don't know, but I'm guessing
whoever the guy Paige is with does.

374
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,228
Then we need to find Paige
and hope that she's not in trouble

375
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,516
so we can find Phoebe
and hope that she's not in trouble.

376
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,079
Well, I wouldn't worry about Paige.

377
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,550
I mean, she's in a public place.
Nobody's gonna hurt her at The Spot.

378
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:17,630
I wasn't expecting company, so just
give me a sec to clean the place up.

379
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,234
I really like your place.

380
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,630
Really? It's a shoebox
compared to yours.

381
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,756
I'm really glad I didn't bring you in.

382
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,832
You know, this is the first time a girl
has ever invited me back to her place.

383
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:33,710
Well, I just thought the club was kind
of noisy, and we could hang out here.

384
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,676
First, actually, I have a question.

385
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,478
About what?

386
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,711
About your house.

387
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,715
I don't really wanna talk about that.

388
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,077
If something bad is going on there,
I need for you to tell me about it.

389
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,393
Please, my sister
could be in trouble.

390
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,989
I don't know much.

391
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:00,194
It's only recently that I've
started asking questions myself.

392
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,109
- Asking who?
- Gammill.

393
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,032
- What's his deal?
- I'm not sure.

394
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,315
Well, how do you know him?

395
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,749
He made me.

396
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,516
Made you what?
Is that like a Mafia thing?

397
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,352
No.

398
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,714
Look, give me your hand.

399
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,592
Put it here.

400
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,312
Do you feel that?

401
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,194
I'm not like you.

402
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,311
Oh, my God.

403
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,035
I just got-- I just got
the creepy shivers myself.

404
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,191
Now I'm glad you
changed the name.

405
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,430
Look at the waitresses.

406
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:02,275
Oh, no, don't look. They're
practically removing their spots.

407
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,710
Can you do that in public?

408
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,556
Listen to me. Just go look
for Paige, okay? Go.

409
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,549
Hold it. You can't go in there.

410
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,473
- Excuse me?
- It's a VlP area.

411
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,359
You're assuming because I'm not tall,
tattooed or big-breasted

412
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,192
that I'm not important?

413
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,476
That's a bad assumption, see,
because I own this club,

414
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,758
- which makes me a VVVlP.
- Piper, Piper.

415
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,515
- What's up, girl?
- Hi.

416
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,432
We got a fly crowd.

417
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,272
I told you all it needed
was a little danger.

418
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,749
Yeah, that's exactly
what this place lacked.

419
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,797
Listen, have you seen
my sister, Paige?

420
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,313
Yeah, she was here but she left.

421
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,198
- She said it was too noisy.
- She said what?

422
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,715
It was too noisy.

423
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,117
Excuse me. Hi, having fun?
Let's go.

424
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,392
Paige took Finn to her loft. Let's go.

425
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:15,440
- Paige?
- What are you doing here?

426
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,229
This is ridiculous.
It's like dealing with a teenager.

427
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,436
- I'm just examining him.
- Okay,

428
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,352
first of all, you should not
have left the club.

429
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,839
- Piper.
- Second of all,

430
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,674
you should not be playing doctor
with the demon boy.

431
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,159
- Piper.
- Third of all--

432
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,072
Piper, he has no bellybutton.

433
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,599
I can explain. First of all, we left
your club because it sucks now.

434
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,638
Okay? Anytime you try
to be that hip, it ain't hip.

435
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:46,918
And second of all, Finn has
no bellybutton because he wasn't born.

436
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,156
I was created out of clay.

437
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,312
In Gammill's own image.
He must be a golem.

438
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,239
I don't know the technical term

439
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,960
but I do know that he needs protection
from the demon that made him.

440
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,633
Okay, hold up.

441
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,313
Where is Gammill now?

442
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,914
At the house, I think.

443
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,399
We were just there.
We didn't see him.

444
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,312
It's because he has
his own secret hiding place.

445
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,948
Could he be hiding
our sister Phoebe there?

446
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,439
No, he probably shrunk her.

447
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,553
I'm sorry, he probably what?

448
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,949
Well, that's what he does.

449
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,759
He takes his wand and he shrinks
the women for his collection.

450
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,869
Oh, God. The figurines.
That's why they're each one of a kind.

451
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,632
We have to get back.
We have to find Phoebe.

452
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,951
Careful. If Gammill is at the house
waiting for you, he'll shrink you all.

453
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,559
I don't know why he didn't before.

454
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,312
Does he still trust you?

455
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,872
- Yeah.
- Okay, then you come with us,

456
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,268
you go in first and distract him.

457
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,034
No, Piper, we can't use Finn
as a minesweeper.

458
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,918
And besides, isn't he an innocent?

459
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,439
Actually, Paige,
innocents tend to be real.

460
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,352
Listen, we have to go get Phoebe.

461
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:47,432
First, we should go by your house,
check the Book of Shadows

462
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,910
to see if there's a spell to undo
shrinking. We'll bring Finn with us.

463
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,399
We don't have time for that.

464
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,993
Well, we can't
go in there unprepared.

465
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,071
Unprepared might be
our best shot right now.

466
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,673
Leo, what do you think?

467
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,512
I think you need
to stop turning to me,

468
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,796
start trying to figure out
a way to listen to each other.

469
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,679
Piper, you don't listen
to Paige's ideas.

470
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,195
And, Paige, you don't listen
to Piper's advice.

471
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:10,718
I think you guys need to figure out
a way how to work as partners.

472
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,199
We're partners.

473
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,749
Equal partners.

474
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,957
Well, listen, can we do that tomorrow?
Right now, we actually need your help.

475
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:21,874
All right, well, I think the best way
that I can help you is by this.

476
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:26,115
- Leo. Great.
- Great. What now?

477
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,988
Well, I'm just gonna have to
convince you that I'm right.

478
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,878
Well, we don't have all day.

479
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,353
Why don't we just flip a coin?

480
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,552
Phoebe's life is at stake.

481
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,472
All the more reason
to make a decision quickly.

482
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,596
Fine. Flip.

483
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,754
- Call it.
- Heads.

484
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,470
Tails.

485
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,474
I win, fair and square.

486
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,115
It's okay, you'll be safe here.

487
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,953
Can I get a glass of water?
My skin feels a little dry.

488
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,669
Yeah, sure. The kitchen's
just down there to the left.

489
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,794
Time to fire up the kiln.

490
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,636
You're next.

491
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,920
At least we came for you.

492
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,637
Phoebe, Paige and I are here now.
We have the power of three.

493
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,155
Can you say a spell?

494
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:14,948
Okay. We'll figure this out.
Paige, let's go over our options.

495
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:18,749
Options? We have two.
We're screwed or we're more screwed.

496
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,957
We don't need negativity.
We need solutions.

497
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,430
Well, I'm sorry, I've never been
shrunk and covered in clay before.

498
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,273
Hey. You wanted to be partners,
so work with me here.

499
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,590
Okay? Or you're right,
we are screwed.

500
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,918
Can't you blast your way out of it?

501
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,832
I tried. I can't move my hands.

502
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,113
I could call for something.
But what would help?

503
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,159
What's the point of having powers
if you can't use them?

504
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,589
What about orbing?

505
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:49,310
- Will Leo hear us?
- No.

506
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,515
You can orb.

507
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,148
- Only in the same place.
- Well, that might work.

508
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,073
The clay is still wet enough, it might
collapse if you leave for a second.

509
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,516
Yeah, only one problem. I've never
been able to orb at will before.

510
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,432
Well, that doesn't mean
that you can't.

511
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,433
- Just concentrate and relax.
- Relax?

512
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,875
- Are you kidding?
- Paige,

513
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,759
just close your eyes,
take a deep breath,

514
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,755
feel the magic rising
from a place of strength.

515
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,912
Feel it building and building.

516
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:23,314
Paige, you're our only hope.

517
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,314
It worked.

518
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,516
How cool was that?

519
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,952
I know, I know. I'm coming.

520
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,919
He's about to put Claudia
into the kiln. Piper, freeze him.

521
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,317
He's way too big for my tiny magic.

522
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,712
- Do you think I can call for his wand?
- I don't know. Try it.

523
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,553
Just keep your voice down.
If he hears us, we'll be cooked.

524
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,673
Wand.

525
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,190
- Wand.
- Go for it.

526
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,588
Wand.

527
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,315
- We need a spark.
- Got it.

528
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,235
Can you freeze him now?

529
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:30,675
Yep.

530
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,796
What do you say we take him out
Charmed-One style?

531
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,949
Don't we need a spell?

532
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,111
That's the good thing about
being stuck in clay all day.

533
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,589
I had time to think of one.
Repeat after me.

534
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,830
- Small of mind
- Small of mind

535
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,672
- Big of woe
- Big of woe

536
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,990
- The pain you caused
- The pain you caused

537
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,754
- You now will know
- You now will know

538
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,676
That's it? That's the spell
you spent all day working on?

539
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,717
Well, it worked, didn't it?

540
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,678
Oh, my gosh. How did you do that?

541
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,155
The power of three.

542
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,276
The power of point three.

543
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:08,629
What do you guys think
of The Spot?

544
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,349
Well, the club scored Dave Navarro.
That's pretty impressive.

545
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:15,318
I still can't get used to
the white gauze.

546
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:19,075
Well, you don't have to.
I told Treat that I just-- I can't do it.

547
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,470
Paige is right. It's trying
way too hard to be hip,

548
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,915
which means it's five minutes away
from being five minutes ago.

549
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,797
The Spot wants to thank
Dave Navarro--

550
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,678
Okay. To the old.

551
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,991
--but he'll be back.
So please, stick around.

552
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,792
What's the matter, honey?

553
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:06,349
The last time I was here,
I was here with Finn.

554
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,070
How do you guys
get over these things?

555
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,674
You don't. But you learn
with experience

556
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:14,673
that you can't dwell on the losses.

557
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,479
- You kind of have to--
- Harden your heart?

558
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,437
Protect your heart.

559
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,592
Unfortunately, it's a fact of our lives

560
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,479
that sometimes the good
comes with a little sadness.

561
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,715
There was a lot of good too.

562
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,154
There was a lot of good.

563
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,754
And my skin looks fabulous.

564
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,956
And now that I've
been five inches tall,

565
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,315
I will never complain
about my height again.

566
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,997
And nor will I doubt
your instincts again.

567
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,434
Thank you.

568
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,310
Okay. Well, then there's just
one more thing that we need to tie up.

569
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,989
Okay.

570
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,952
Leo, what are you looking for?

571
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,429
Something very important.

572
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,429
Broken glass?

573
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,872
Broken glass that needs healing.

574
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,949
Here it is.

575
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,158
It's up to you.

576
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,872
Can you do it?

577
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,479
Well, then do it.

578
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,750
Looks like P3's back.
