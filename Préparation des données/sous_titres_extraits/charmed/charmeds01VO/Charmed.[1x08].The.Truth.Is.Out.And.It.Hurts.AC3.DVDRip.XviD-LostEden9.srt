1
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:10,761
Excuse me.

2
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,304
Are you Dr Mitchell?

3
00:00:12,512 --> 00:00:15,474
- Dr Oliver Mitchell?
- Yes.

4
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:17,476
What a pleasure.

5
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,896
I can't tell you how long
I've waited for this.

6
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,527
Excuse me but have we...?

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:31,907
Met? Oh, I'm sorry. Only in print.
I've read your work.

8
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:37,370
Your studies, specifically on cell
degeneration, are ahead of their time.

9
00:00:38,622 --> 00:00:41,499
- You're very kind.
- No, really, it's fascinating.

10
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:45,879
You've become
kind of a hobby of mine.

11
00:00:47,631 --> 00:00:53,762
I found your article on the mutant
retina gene to be particularly intriguing.

12
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,096
But I haven't even...

13
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,683
Published it yet?
Don't worry, you will.

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,394
And you'll help to find the vaccine.

15
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:04,898
A vaccine? Against what?

16
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,775
Against this.

17
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:26,794
"Ask again later." Hello, vague.

18
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:30,048
How am I supposed to plan my future
without a little direction?

19
00:01:30,214 --> 00:01:32,925
You who can see the future
is now looking for it in a Magic 8 Ball?

20
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:35,219
My visions don't help me, remember?

21
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:39,348
I've got an idea. Why don't we ask if
Prue and Andy will get back together?

22
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:41,642
Oh, Phoebe, please, don't.

23
00:01:41,809 --> 00:01:43,060
- Interesting.
- Very.

24
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,273
You two are cruel.

25
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,277
Ask it what a day off feels like?
That was my boss, Martin.

26
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:53,487
- I have to go to the restaurant.
- You're kidding.

27
00:01:53,654 --> 00:01:56,657
There's a convention in town,
and business is just crazy.

28
00:01:56,824 --> 00:02:00,077
But you worked a double shift
yesterday and the day before that.

29
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:01,829
He's working you to death, Piper.

30
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,123
You were gonna talk to Martin
about this weeks ago.

31
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,833
I never got around to it.

32
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,710
Yeah, well, tell him to stuff it.

33
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,129
Tell him you're taking the night off,
and that's that.

34
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,840
I know, you're right, I will.
Hello, Martin?

35
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,259
No, I know what you want, but...

36
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:18,387
Okay. No, it's not a problem.
I'll be right there.

37
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:21,807
Wow, you told him.

38
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:23,934
Beware the wrath of Piper.

39
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:27,479
I will talk to him, eventually.
I gotta go.

40
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:31,233
Wait, Piper.
I'll walk you to the car. It's safer.

41
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,568
I'll wait here.

42
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,615
Excuse me. Pardon me.

43
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:46,081
Oh, my God, Piper.

44
00:02:48,667 --> 00:02:50,878
- What is it?
- I just had a premonition.

45
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,088
A woman's about to get murdered.

46
00:03:11,648 --> 00:03:12,774
Oh, my God.

47
00:03:14,526 --> 00:03:17,195
Phoebe saw this murder
before it happened.

48
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:19,364
No, not this one.

49
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:22,826
I think I saw the next one.

50
00:05:20,151 --> 00:05:23,112
- Is this leaded?
- Always is.

51
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:31,704
Good morning, ladies.
I took a look at the staircase.

52
00:05:31,871 --> 00:05:34,456
Shouldn't be more than two days' work.
You mind if I get started?

53
00:05:34,623 --> 00:05:37,877
No, not at all.
I'll get you some coffee.

54
00:05:38,168 --> 00:05:41,630
Oops, you're busy. I'll get it.

55
00:05:41,797 --> 00:05:43,173
I'll be right there, Leo.

56
00:05:46,719 --> 00:05:49,305
When are you two gonna stop fighting
over him and grow up?

57
00:05:49,471 --> 00:05:54,101
When Phoebe realizes that she
doesn't have a chance with him.

58
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:58,188
Well, that doesn't matter now because
I have to go protect the innocent.

59
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:02,985
So we'll call a truce temporarily.
I'll just take this to Leo.

60
00:06:10,409 --> 00:06:12,619
You know that you're only into him
because Piper is.

61
00:06:12,828 --> 00:06:16,582
That is so not true. I'm wounded.

62
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,750
Is there anything
about last night's murders?

63
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:20,127
Nothing of any use.

64
00:06:20,294 --> 00:06:22,796
How am I supposed to figure out
who the girl in my vision is?

65
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:24,006
What did she look like?

66
00:06:24,172 --> 00:06:29,928
Well, she was about 5'3"
and her hair was lightish.

67
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:32,597
That's it?

68
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:35,767
If it's not on videotape,
I can't exactly rewind it.

69
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:40,439
Hey, you've gotta talk to Andy.

70
00:06:40,605 --> 00:06:42,566
- What?
- Well, if I can't find her,

71
00:06:42,732 --> 00:06:44,901
then I have to find the killer
before he gets to her.

72
00:06:45,068 --> 00:06:46,987
<i>Well, have you checked
the Book of Shadows?</i>

73
00:06:47,153 --> 00:06:50,156
The way you described your vision,
it sounds like it could be demonic.

74
00:06:50,323 --> 00:06:53,451
Yeah, but for all we know,
Andy's already hot on his trail.

75
00:06:53,618 --> 00:06:55,161
You have to go see him and find out.

76
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:56,997
- Can't.
- Won't.

77
00:06:57,163 --> 00:06:59,207
Give me a break.
We just stopped seeing each other.

78
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:01,001
Don't you think it might be awkward?

79
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:04,337
<i>Okay, then how about I go see him,
and you look in the Book of Shadows?</i>

80
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:07,215
- Phoebe.
- Prue, I had this vision for a reason.

81
00:07:07,382 --> 00:07:10,343
I am supposed to save her.
I know it.

82
00:07:11,928 --> 00:07:13,972
I have to find her.

83
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:25,608
Nothing.

84
00:07:25,775 --> 00:07:27,861
I don't even know
what I'm looking for.

85
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:45,336
"Truth spell."

86
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,223
What the...?

87
00:08:12,238 --> 00:08:14,907
The truth is,
I need extra tablecloths because...

88
00:08:15,074 --> 00:08:17,159
Oh, wine!

89
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:23,791
I need this space. Can't you do that
in the manager's office?

90
00:08:23,958 --> 00:08:27,044
- You took my desk, remember?
- Then go somewhere else.

91
00:08:27,211 --> 00:08:29,630
I've got a restaurant
full of hungry conventioneers.

92
00:08:29,797 --> 00:08:31,298
I just ran out of white corn chowder,

93
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:33,759
and I need you to get ahold
of produce, pronto.

94
00:08:33,926 --> 00:08:37,054
- Well, what about the books?
- You can take them home with you.

95
00:08:37,221 --> 00:08:40,558
I come back after three weeks,
and the whole place is chaos.

96
00:08:41,725 --> 00:08:43,519
Martin, you know what I think?

97
00:08:43,686 --> 00:08:45,020
What? What do you think?

98
00:08:46,564 --> 00:08:48,649
I think I'm gonna need
that number for produce.

99
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:03,247
- Hey.
- Hey.

100
00:09:03,414 --> 00:09:07,084
Can I borrow your laptop?
I need to do some surfing on the Web.

101
00:09:07,251 --> 00:09:11,630
See if I can find anything about
the burns on the victim's forehead.

102
00:09:12,047 --> 00:09:13,340
What?

103
00:09:13,507 --> 00:09:16,802
Nothing. I just never really thought
of you as computer-friendly.

104
00:09:16,969 --> 00:09:19,638
Are you kidding?
Chat rooms saved my life.

105
00:09:21,723 --> 00:09:24,893
So did you talk to Andy?

106
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:27,437
Actually, I spoke to his partner instead.

107
00:09:27,604 --> 00:09:30,691
- You told Morris?
- About the case? I didn't have to.

108
00:09:30,857 --> 00:09:33,777
Every inspector at the station
was talking about it.

109
00:09:33,944 --> 00:09:37,155
The only problem is, they're stumped.

110
00:09:37,322 --> 00:09:39,366
<i>Did you find anything
in the Book of Shadows?</i>

111
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm not sure.
So you didn't see Andy?

112
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:45,789
No, I said I didn't talk to Andy.

113
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:48,583
I saw him in the parking lot
when I left.

114
00:09:49,042 --> 00:09:50,502
But...

115
00:09:51,586 --> 00:09:52,963
...he had that look, Prue.

116
00:09:53,797 --> 00:09:55,799
You know the one I'm taking about.

117
00:09:56,007 --> 00:09:57,968
You might recognize it from the mirror.

118
00:09:59,803 --> 00:10:01,263
He really cares about you.

119
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:03,765
Don't you think I know that?

120
00:10:03,932 --> 00:10:06,309
So, what are you waiting for?
Tell him the truth.

121
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:08,311
It's the only thing
standing between you guys.

122
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:11,690
Tell him that I'm a witch? I can't
do that. What if he can't handle it?

123
00:10:11,856 --> 00:10:14,192
It's not like I can put the genie
back in the bottle.

124
00:10:14,359 --> 00:10:17,237
He's not gonna turn you in
to the warlock police.

125
00:10:17,404 --> 00:10:20,949
At least you'd know
how he feels once and for all.

126
00:10:21,157 --> 00:10:25,078
Otherwise, you'll never know
if it could've worked out or not.

127
00:10:26,162 --> 00:10:29,415
If I were you, I would figure out
a way to tell him.

128
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:33,670
Thank you for the laptop.

129
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,391
- Sandwich?
- Hey, Tanya, sure.

130
00:10:48,059 --> 00:10:50,895
I saved you your favourite.
Turkey, no mayo.

131
00:10:51,187 --> 00:10:52,230
You're a good woman.

132
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:54,690
- Thanks.
- Bye.

133
00:11:16,045 --> 00:11:18,005
Okay, you win.

134
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:22,760
Hey, stranger. Back from the war?

135
00:11:22,927 --> 00:11:25,513
More like I brought the battle
home with me. Inventory.

136
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,849
I'll help you with yours
if you help me with mine.

137
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,227
<i>"For those who want the truth revealed</i>

138

<i>From now until it's now again

140
00:11:37,733 --> 00:11:39,401
So I guess you didn't talk
to your boss.

141
00:11:39,568 --> 00:11:42,321
Of course I did.
Just like I said I would.

142
00:11:45,241 --> 00:11:47,159
Am I getting a zit on my chin?

143
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:49,578
Can't even see it.

00:11:58,045 --> 00:11:59,755
You really can't see it?

00:11:59,964 --> 00:12:03,092
Are you kidding? It looks like
that thing has a life of its own.

148
00:12:03,258 --> 00:12:04,760
What?

149
00:12:05,511 --> 00:12:07,096
So you really told off Martin, huh?

150
00:12:07,388 --> 00:12:10,140
No, I lied. I chickened out.

151
00:12:22,277 --> 00:12:23,612

152
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:26,365

I'll get back to you. Thanks.</i>

153
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:30,327
Hi. Hi, Andy, it's Prue.

154
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,204
Hey, I was wondering, I...

155
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:34,456
Could you just call me, please?

156
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:37,125
Soon. Within the next 24 hours.

157
00:12:37,292 --> 00:12:39,211
I need to talk to you
about something.

158
00:12:39,378 --> 00:12:43,715
So just call, okay? Bye.

159
00:12:43,882 --> 00:12:47,052
You know tonight would be fine too.

160
00:12:47,219 --> 00:12:49,012
Okay, bye.

161
00:13:01,107 --> 00:13:02,984
Excuse me.

162
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:05,362
Are you Mr Pearson?

163
00:13:05,528 --> 00:13:07,489
Alex Pearson?

164
00:13:07,989 --> 00:13:09,240
Yeah, yeah, can I help you?

165
00:13:09,449 --> 00:13:11,451
In so many ways.

166
00:13:12,077 --> 00:13:14,829
Working late tonight, aren't you?

167
00:13:15,038 --> 00:13:17,123
Yeah, I work better at night.

168
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,585
And these soil samples just arrived
from the Bindura plateau.

169
00:13:20,752 --> 00:13:23,463
Ah, Zimbabwe.

170
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:28,593
Their crops have been
overrun by disease for decades.

171
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:31,805
Well...

172
00:13:32,138 --> 00:13:34,474
...your work will put an end to that.

173
00:13:36,017 --> 00:13:38,228
- That's the hope.
- That's the reality.

174
00:13:38,895 --> 00:13:42,982
Are you from the foundation? They
don't usually check up on us this late.

175
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:45,026
No, no.

176
00:13:45,193 --> 00:13:49,405
But I have studied your work,
and I know what it will lead to.

177
00:13:49,572 --> 00:13:52,992
My work? You mean the lab's.
I'm only just a technician.

178
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:55,703
For now, Alex.

179
00:13:56,245 --> 00:14:01,542
But someday. Someday you
will help find the vaccine.

180
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,589
The vaccine? For what?

181
00:14:08,049 --> 00:14:10,426
I'm sorry, who are you?
What do you want?

182
00:14:14,514 --> 00:14:15,890
Your future.

183
00:14:24,523 --> 00:14:26,067
Dear God, what is it?

184
00:14:50,007 --> 00:14:51,592
Thanks.

185
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,844
- Is this leaded?
- Nope.

186
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:55,888
- It's not?
- Never has been.

187
00:14:56,055 --> 00:14:58,807
I just say it is because it's ridiculous
to make two pots of coffee

188
00:14:58,974 --> 00:15:01,685
when you're the only one
who drinks diesel.

189
00:15:03,937 --> 00:15:06,148
Prue, don't give me grief
when you get the phone bill.

190
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:10,402
I was up all night on the Internet,
and I didn't find anything.

191
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:12,196
That poor girl.

192
00:15:12,363 --> 00:15:16,617
Oh, Piper, I'm sorry about the crack
I made last night about your zit.

193
00:15:16,784 --> 00:15:19,328
That's okay. So you really can't see it?

194
00:15:20,412 --> 00:15:21,663
Like I said, it's huge.

195
00:15:25,042 --> 00:15:27,503
Something weird is going on.

196
00:15:27,711 --> 00:15:30,839
Morning, ladies. Should be able
to finish the stairs today.

197
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:34,635
Okay. I'll make some more coffee.

198
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,595
And I'll bring it to you.

199
00:15:36,762 --> 00:15:38,513
Okay.

200
00:15:40,932 --> 00:15:42,517
Here we go again, right?

201
00:15:42,726 --> 00:15:47,898
Piper, we both know the only reason
I like Leo is because you do.

202
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:52,277
Okay, I have no idea
why I just said that.

203
00:15:52,444 --> 00:15:53,862
What's going on?

204
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:55,906
Okay, I'm late for work. Busy, gotta go.

205
00:15:56,698 --> 00:15:58,658
- Prue!
- Yeah?

206
00:15:58,825 --> 00:15:59,868
Spill. What's up?

207
00:16:00,494 --> 00:16:01,870
I cast a truth spell.

208
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:03,622
- What?
- What?

209
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,290
You cast a truth spell?

210
00:16:05,457 --> 00:16:07,292
Yes! Look, please, no more questions.

211
00:16:07,459 --> 00:16:09,211
- Why?
- Because I wanted to know

212
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:12,255
what Andy would think of me
if he found out I was a witch.

213
00:16:12,631 --> 00:16:13,757
I can't believe it.

214
00:16:13,924 --> 00:16:16,760
Oh, look who's talking,
Little Miss Spell-of-the-Week.

215
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:20,013
No, no. I mean I can't believe
you actually took my advice.

216
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,806
The biggest pooper
at the Wicca party

217
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:25,310
has finally used her power
for personal gain. It's about time.

218
00:16:25,477 --> 00:16:28,229
Personal? It's affecting us.
Prue, what have you done?

219
00:16:28,772 --> 00:16:31,775
The spell was only supposed
to work on me, okay?

220
00:16:31,941 --> 00:16:34,360
It said, "those in this house."
I thought I was alone.

221
00:16:34,527 --> 00:16:36,029
Well, obviously, you weren't.

222
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:39,115
Wait, we just have to...
We have to undo it right now, fast.

223
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:42,410
Can't. Twenty-four-hour time limit.
Which means until 8:00 tonight

224
00:16:42,577 --> 00:16:44,662
everybody who comes
into contact with us will have

225
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:47,790
- no choice but to speak the truth.
- What do you mean "no choice"?

226
00:16:47,957 --> 00:16:49,584
Exactly that. Ask me a question.

227
00:16:49,751 --> 00:16:52,503
I'm game.
Prue, what do you think of me?

228
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,922
While I admire your confidence
and your fearlessness,

229
00:16:55,089 --> 00:16:57,842
your utter lack of responsibility
frustrates me to no end.

230
00:16:58,009 --> 00:16:59,677
Oh, God, that is so enough.

231
00:16:59,844 --> 00:17:02,221
Oh, my God.
This could be very dangerous.

232
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:06,851
I'm kind of digging it. Piper, what
do you really think of your boss?

233
00:17:07,018 --> 00:17:10,855
I think he's a self-serving jerk
who must have a very small penis.

234
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,525
- Oh, my God! I'm gonna be so fired.
- No, no, no. It's okay.

235
00:17:14,692 --> 00:17:18,613
Because once the spell ends, no one
will remember what they've heard.

236
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:21,365
You guys, I just wanted to see
how Andy would react.

237
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:23,618
What a way to come
out of the broom closet.

238
00:17:23,784 --> 00:17:27,371
Are you nuts? We just need
to lock the doors, call in sick

239
00:17:27,538 --> 00:17:30,249
and just stay in our own bedrooms
until it just goes away.

240
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,919
Hello, there's a demon on the loose,
and I still have to find that woman.

241
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:36,130
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.

242
00:17:36,339 --> 00:17:38,924
- Premonition?
- No. An epiphany.

243
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:42,178
So are you telling me
that everyone I ask a question to

244
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:44,013
has to answer with the truth?

245
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,599
I think so, yes. But that also means,

246
00:17:46,766 --> 00:17:49,310
if we get asked a question,
we have to answer with the truth.

247
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:50,895
I can work around that.

248
00:17:51,061 --> 00:17:53,606
This is cool. Very cool.

249
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,692
Phoebe, no. Where are you go...?

250
00:17:59,486 --> 00:18:03,324
Don't even think of asking me
what I think about you right now.

251
00:18:15,961 --> 00:18:17,421
- Phoebe.
- Hi, Andy.

252
00:18:17,629 --> 00:18:19,173
- What...?
- Have you talked to Prue?

253
00:18:19,381 --> 00:18:21,175
She left a message
on my machine last night.

254
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:23,093
Wasn't sure if I wanted to
call her back.

255
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,554
Oh, believe me. Trust me.

256
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:28,390
You definitely want to call her back.

257
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:30,100
That why you came here?

258
00:18:30,267 --> 00:18:32,019
Hardly.

259
00:18:33,353 --> 00:18:35,939
What do you know about the guy
they found murdered

260
00:18:36,106 --> 00:18:38,775
in the movie theatre parking lot
the other night?

261
00:18:38,942 --> 00:18:40,777
Lead detective says
he's not the only victim.

262
00:18:40,944 --> 00:18:43,113
They found a lab technician
out in Oakland.

263
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,616
They had the same
cauterized mark on their forehead,

264
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:48,744
and their eyes were drained of colour.
They were completely white.

265
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,787
- Wait.
- Cause of death?

266
00:18:51,204 --> 00:18:53,248
Unknown. Looks like
they took a bullet to the head,

267
00:18:53,415 --> 00:18:55,208
only there's no exit wound
and no bullet.

268
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:56,460
Phoebe, this is highly...

269
00:18:56,626 --> 00:18:58,128
- Any suspects?
- Not yet.

270
00:18:58,336 --> 00:19:00,213
Any evidence that could
lead to a suspect?

271
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,299
They found a button
at the crime scene,

272
00:19:02,466 --> 00:19:04,593
possibly from the suspect's jacket,
made of an alloy

273
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,053
Forensics has never seen before.
What the hell is...?

274
00:19:07,762 --> 00:19:10,098
Do not ask that question.

275
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:11,641
I gotta go. Thanks.

276
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:14,561
Don't forget to call Prue
by 8:00 tonight.

277
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:28,199
Hello? I mean, Prue Halliwell.

278
00:19:28,366 --> 00:19:30,785
<i>- Hey, it's me.
- Andy, hi.</i>

279
00:19:30,994 --> 00:19:33,913
Phoebe stopped by,
suggested I give you a call.

280
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,999
Phoebe.

281
00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,043
Yeah, but can we meet? I really
don't wanna talk over the phone.

282
00:19:39,252 --> 00:19:41,588
Should I be looking forward to this
or dreading it?

283
00:19:41,754 --> 00:19:43,006
Honestly, I don't know.

284
00:19:43,173 --> 00:19:46,968
But what are you doing for dinner?
An early dinner? Like, let's say, now?

285
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,678
<i>It's lunchtime.</i>

286
00:19:49,137 --> 00:19:51,848
<i>But I'm gonna be interviewing
a witness in your area around 5.</i>

287
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,182
I could swing by after.

288
00:19:54,392 --> 00:19:55,435
Yeah?

289
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:58,062
Here? Yeah, I guess that's fine.

290
00:19:58,229 --> 00:19:59,939
All right, I'll see you then.

291
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,442
- Hey, Tanya.
- Personal call, Prue?

292
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,901
Personal business, Hannah.

293
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:06,195
And I swear that
that's my name on the door.

294
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,823
Look.

295
00:20:09,365 --> 00:20:11,534
Last turkey, no mayo. My favourite.

296
00:20:12,326 --> 00:20:15,997
- Actually, I was saving that for Prue.
- Yeah, you were.

297
00:20:17,373 --> 00:20:18,541
Don't you hate turkey?

298
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:21,002
Of course I do.
I just don't want you to have it.

299
00:20:22,837 --> 00:20:25,840
Is there any particular reason
why you're such a bitch to me?

300
00:20:26,007 --> 00:20:28,801
Yes. Because it's my mission in life
to destroy you.

301
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:32,847
Well, nothing like a bit
of interoffice rivalry

302
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,266
to get those
competitive juices flowing.

303
00:20:36,726 --> 00:20:39,061
Hannah, a word.

304
00:20:51,198 --> 00:20:55,077
- What do you think you're doing?
- I don't know. It came out.

305
00:20:55,244 --> 00:20:58,372
No, no, no. It didn't just come out,
you almost came out.

306
00:20:58,581 --> 00:21:01,709
Am I to believe that suddenly
you've lost control of your faculties?

307
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:03,627
No.

308
00:21:04,128 --> 00:21:06,714
God, she's just so...

309
00:21:06,881 --> 00:21:08,215
So Prue.

310
00:21:12,469 --> 00:21:14,346
Forgive me?

311
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:19,893
Always.

312
00:21:21,812 --> 00:21:23,313
Hey.

313
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:36,535
Go on, get back to work.

314
00:21:45,752 --> 00:21:49,423
Martin, I can't work tonight.
I have to do the books.

315
00:21:49,590 --> 00:21:52,801
Do the books and run the floor?
That's imposs...

316
00:21:52,968 --> 00:21:54,970
But you don't underst...

317
00:21:55,804 --> 00:21:57,305
Right now?

318
00:21:57,472 --> 00:21:59,474
I'm on my way.

319
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:03,228
Nice talking to you too, jerk.

320
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:13,155
Hey, I had a little bit of an accident.
Do you mind if I borrow your washer?

321
00:22:13,321 --> 00:22:16,324
No, not at all. Go right ahead.
Can I get you some coffee?

322
00:22:16,491 --> 00:22:19,578
You'd better not. I'll just wind up
knocking it all over again.

323
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:23,290
Truth is, caffeine makes me
a little clumsy, you know.

324
00:22:23,623 --> 00:22:25,917
- Leo, wait.
- Yeah.

325
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:29,296
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

326
00:22:30,964 --> 00:22:32,257
Do you need another shirt?

327
00:22:32,716 --> 00:22:35,260
No, I got one in the truck. Thanks.

328
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,471
Leo, wait. That wasn't my question.

329
00:22:38,638 --> 00:22:40,890
- It wasn't?
- No.

330
00:22:41,766 --> 00:22:45,770
I was just wondering,
do you ever think of me?

331
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:47,689
- Yeah.
- In what way?

332
00:22:47,856 --> 00:22:51,484
- As a friend sort of way or...?
- You have beautiful eyes.

333
00:22:51,651 --> 00:22:53,278
That's a good way.

334
00:22:53,444 --> 00:22:57,240
I'm sorry.
That was totally inappropriate,

335
00:22:57,407 --> 00:22:59,659
- wasn't it?
- No, not at all.

336
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:01,160
Oh, what the hell.

337
00:23:01,327 --> 00:23:03,663
Leo, how do you feel about women
who make the first move?

338
00:23:04,289 --> 00:23:06,624
I don't know.
I'm still waiting for it to happen.

339
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,751
Goodness.

340
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,430
How do you feel about guys
who make the second move?

341
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:22,515
Love them.

342
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:34,819
- Hi, Rex.
- Hello, Prue. How are you?

343
00:23:34,986 --> 00:23:36,112
I am a nervous wreck

344
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,698
because I'm about to tell
my boyfriend that I am a wi...

345
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:44,078
- ner. A winner.
She is a real catch, this one is.

346
00:23:44,245 --> 00:23:46,414
I'm Phoebe, her sister.
We met, remember?

347
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,290
Yeah, how could I forget?

348
00:23:48,457 --> 00:23:50,167
Let's go to my office.

349
00:23:50,334 --> 00:23:53,379
- Okay, the spell is really working.
- Yeah, I know. So you talked to Andy?

350
00:23:53,546 --> 00:23:55,631
I sure did. He gave me
a list of all the victims.

351
00:23:55,798 --> 00:23:57,508
They all died the same way too.

352
00:23:57,675 --> 00:23:59,468
Only problem is,
they don't have a suspect,

353
00:23:59,635 --> 00:24:02,054
which means that
I have no way of finding...

354
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,893
- Her.
- Who her?

355
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,728
That's the girl from my premonition.

356
00:24:09,895 --> 00:24:11,522
Tanya?

357
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:14,108
Wait, hold the elevator.

358
00:24:17,653 --> 00:24:19,154
Excuse me.

359
00:24:19,321 --> 00:24:20,739
Are you Mrs Parker?

360
00:24:21,448 --> 00:24:23,659
- Tanya Parker?
- Yes.

361
00:24:24,868 --> 00:24:28,455
You have been most difficult to find.

362
00:24:28,664 --> 00:24:31,792
Never in the same place.
Never alone.

363
00:24:31,959 --> 00:24:33,043
Excuse me?

364
00:24:35,546 --> 00:24:37,798
- Are you sure?
- Yes, and that's the truth.

365
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:41,135
All right, take the stairs.
I'll call security.

366
00:24:42,553 --> 00:24:44,388
Get off me!

367
00:24:53,605 --> 00:24:55,607
Get off me!

368
00:24:58,151 --> 00:25:01,071
Run, Tanya, ru... Oh, my!

369
00:25:07,869 --> 00:25:09,496
Drive!

370
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:17,921
Phoebe!

371
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:32,018
Honey, I'm fine.

372
00:25:32,185 --> 00:25:34,896
No, there's no reason
to fly back early.

373
00:25:35,105 --> 00:25:37,482
I'm staying...

374
00:25:37,649 --> 00:25:38,733
...with friends.

375
00:25:40,318 --> 00:25:42,070
I'll explain it all when you get home.

376
00:25:42,237 --> 00:25:44,656
- Kids? Do you have any kids?
- Not yet.

377
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,867
- Pets?
- No.

378
00:25:49,035 --> 00:25:50,495
I love you too.

379
00:25:55,291 --> 00:25:57,544
Before I can explain any of this
to my husband,

380
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,088
you're gonna have to
explain it to me.

381
00:26:00,255 --> 00:26:01,965
What is going on?

382
00:26:02,131 --> 00:26:04,050
Short story: You're in danger.

383
00:26:04,425 --> 00:26:07,470
And to keep you out of it, we have to
keep you out of the obvious places,

384
00:26:07,637 --> 00:26:09,138
which is why you have to stay here.

385
00:26:09,389 --> 00:26:11,766
- But what was that thing?
- Truth spell.

386
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,726
That thing...

387
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:15,186
...was a demon.

388
00:26:16,187 --> 00:26:17,522
I'm out of here.

389
00:26:17,689 --> 00:26:20,233
No, Tanya, he's killed before.

390
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:22,443
Trust me. Call the cops. Check it out.

391
00:26:22,652 --> 00:26:25,738
That burn on your forehead,
that's how he does it.

392
00:26:25,905 --> 00:26:28,574
I've seen it, okay? I have visions.

393
00:26:28,741 --> 00:26:31,994
Visions of people
that I'm supposed to help.

394
00:26:32,537 --> 00:26:36,457
I've seen his next victim. It's you.

395
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:41,629
There are no coincidences.

396
00:26:42,505 --> 00:26:46,133
I was supposed to see you,
to find you.

397
00:26:47,051 --> 00:26:48,636
And now I'm supposed to save you.

398
00:26:56,227 --> 00:26:57,728
- Romaine in fridge three.
- Okay.

399
00:26:57,895 --> 00:27:00,731
Phoebe. You have her there,
at the house?

400
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:02,733
I understand you have to
protect the innocent,

401
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,319
but couldn't you find one that makes
a decent béarnaise sauce?

402
00:27:05,486 --> 00:27:06,779
My kitchen is collapsing.

403
00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:09,782
Well, I gotta go.
I'll be there as soon as I can.

404
00:27:09,949 --> 00:27:12,368
Martin, hi. Just the man I wanted to...

405
00:27:12,535 --> 00:27:14,286
I made a list.
You better check it twice.

406
00:27:14,495 --> 00:27:16,330
I'll be back after the dinner rush.

407
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:18,541
But I've got a family situation.

408
00:27:18,707 --> 00:27:21,377
So you'd like to take off, go home,
take care of business?

409
00:27:21,543 --> 00:27:23,545
Thank you, Martin,
for understanding.

410
00:27:23,712 --> 00:27:25,923
Well, don't thank me,
because the answer is no.

411
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:30,010
All right, Martin. What part of "family
situation" do you not understand?

412
00:27:30,177 --> 00:27:32,930
Are you insane?
No one person can do all of this.

413
00:27:33,097 --> 00:27:35,099
How do you expect
me to do it all alone?

414
00:27:35,307 --> 00:27:36,642
- Because I know you will.
- What?

415
00:27:36,809 --> 00:27:38,769
Why spend money on employees
when I know you'll do it?

416
00:27:38,936 --> 00:27:40,395
And you won't complain.

417
00:27:40,562 --> 00:27:42,648
I've got a bargain,
all the work for half the price.

418
00:27:43,941 --> 00:27:45,901
Piper, I don't know why I said that.

419
00:27:46,068 --> 00:27:48,946
Too late, Martin.
Truth's out, and so am I.

420
00:27:49,112 --> 00:27:50,781
You don't deserve me. I quit.

421
00:28:06,546 --> 00:28:09,257
- Andy, hi.
- Hello, Prue.

422
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:14,763
I am so sorry I'm late.
My meeting ran over.

423
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:17,432
Your assistant said I could wait here.
I hope that's okay.

424
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:20,727
Yeah, of course. Can I get you
anything? Something to drink?

425
00:28:20,894 --> 00:28:22,521
I'm fine.

426
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:26,024
- How are you?
- A nervous wreck. You?

427
00:28:26,191 --> 00:28:29,027
Heart's pounding
like a sledgehammer.

428
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:35,617
So, Andy...

429
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:38,161
...how well do you think
you really know me?

430
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,206
Well, I know about
your fondness for Twizzlers,

431
00:28:41,373 --> 00:28:44,084
how you can't stand it
when people talk at the previews,

432
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:45,960
how you like to argue to win,

433
00:28:46,461 --> 00:28:49,172
and how you pick your cuticles
when you're nervous.

434
00:28:49,964 --> 00:28:53,426
I also know I'd love to
start seeing you again.

435
00:28:53,593 --> 00:28:57,430
I wish you could trust me enough to
tell me whatever it is you're afraid of.

436
00:28:58,223 --> 00:29:02,143
Well, actually that's what
I wanted to see you about.

437
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:07,398
Except that instead of telling you,
I think I'll just show you...

438
00:29:07,565 --> 00:29:09,150
...so here it goes.

439
00:29:09,525 --> 00:29:11,611
You see this?

440
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:13,196
Watch.

441
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,116
What the hell was that?

442
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,536
My secret. I did that with my mind.

443
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,497
- You're telekinetic?
- Yes.

444
00:29:22,664 --> 00:29:27,043
Well, no. Actually, it's just so
much more than that. I'm a witch.

445
00:29:28,753 --> 00:29:30,213
- A what?
- A good witch.

446
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:32,840
I have powers. I never wanted them.

447
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:35,468
I didn't even find out about them
until recently.

448
00:29:36,719 --> 00:29:38,888
Right around the time
that I ran into you again.

449
00:29:41,474 --> 00:29:42,600
Okay.

450
00:29:42,767 --> 00:29:45,728
You know all those times
that I disappeared

451
00:29:45,895 --> 00:29:48,981
or would show up at a crime scene
with no logical explanation.

452
00:29:49,148 --> 00:29:51,359
Well, this is why.

453
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:55,321
And believe me, I wanted to tell you,
but I couldn't.

454
00:29:55,613 --> 00:29:56,864
I couldn't tell anyone.

455
00:29:59,408 --> 00:30:01,410
Are you okay?

456
00:30:02,661 --> 00:30:04,372
I don't know.

457
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,627
I mean, of all the things I thought
you were hiding, this was...

458
00:30:09,794 --> 00:30:11,170
...actually nowhere on the list.

459
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:16,383
Does this mean
that Piper and Phoebe are...?

460
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:22,097
Yeah. We inherited our powers
from Mom and Grams.

461
00:30:22,848 --> 00:30:24,225
So when you have kids...?

462
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:27,770
If they're girls, yes.

463
00:30:28,062 --> 00:30:31,440
Well, that's a...

464
00:30:32,858 --> 00:30:34,818
That's quite a secret
you've been hiding.

465
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,695
Tell me about it.

466
00:30:37,488 --> 00:30:40,115
Can you change? I mean,
is this something you can get rid of?

467
00:30:41,658 --> 00:30:45,079
No. Andy, I can't change who I am.

468
00:30:46,663 --> 00:30:49,249
And that's something
that I've recently come to accept.

469
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:53,128
The question is, can you?

470
00:30:53,962 --> 00:30:56,256
Well, to tell you the truth...

471
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:00,427
...I don't know, Prue.

472
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:04,264
I honestly don't know.

473
00:31:14,858 --> 00:31:17,778
- Did Prue talk to Andy?
- She didn't say.

474
00:31:17,944 --> 00:31:19,780
<i>Did you find anything
in the Book of Shadows?</i>

475
00:31:19,946 --> 00:31:21,448
Nothing I recognize.

476
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:26,536
So Andy said the third victim
was a professor at Stanford?

477
00:31:26,745 --> 00:31:29,414
- What's the link?
- He thinks it has something to do

478
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:31,791
with what they're working on.
Biogenetics.

479
00:31:32,626 --> 00:31:35,921
A professor, a geneticist,
a lab technician...

480
00:31:36,129 --> 00:31:38,256
And a sandwich girl?

481
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:41,384
- Do you really think he's after me?
- Truth spell.

482
00:31:50,602 --> 00:31:53,730
Piper, we need milk. Kitchen.

483
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:03,239
- She's carrying.
- Carrying what?

484
00:32:03,406 --> 00:32:05,325
A baby, she's pregnant.

485
00:32:05,492 --> 00:32:07,035
No, no. She doesn't know yet.

486
00:32:08,119 --> 00:32:09,787
What do we do? Do we tell her?

487
00:32:09,954 --> 00:32:11,956
I mean, we protect,
we don't do prenatal.

488
00:32:12,165 --> 00:32:14,667
No, this not the kind of information
Tanya needs right now,

489
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:16,336
especially from people she just met

490
00:32:16,502 --> 00:32:18,588
who are telling her
some three-eyed demon

491
00:32:18,755 --> 00:32:21,215
wants to suck the life out of her.

492
00:32:21,424 --> 00:32:23,718
Suck the life out of her.

493
00:32:23,885 --> 00:32:27,680
Wait a minute. Is it possible
that it's not Tanya he wants?

494
00:32:27,847 --> 00:32:30,725
- That it's her baby?
- How would he know she's pregnant?

495
00:32:31,934 --> 00:32:36,773
I don't know.
Maybe he sees the future too.

496
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,984
Or else he's from it.

497
00:32:40,151 --> 00:32:41,944
- Excuse me?
- The button.

498
00:32:42,111 --> 00:32:44,322
The police found a button
by one of the last victims

499
00:32:44,489 --> 00:32:47,909
made out of some kind of funky metal
they'd never seen before.

500
00:32:48,492 --> 00:32:49,869
- Rewind.
- Okay.

501
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:52,038
There's a button
that's not supposed to exist,

502
00:32:52,205 --> 00:32:54,665
<i>a demon that the Book of Shadows
says doesn't exist</i>

503
00:32:54,832 --> 00:32:58,461
and a baby no one knows exists.
You got a better explanation?

504
00:32:58,878 --> 00:33:00,921
Even if you're right,
how will we find him?

505
00:33:01,881 --> 00:33:04,008
Well, he wants Tanya. He'll find us.

506
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,509
He doesn't know where we are.

507
00:33:05,718 --> 00:33:09,055
Well, he found Tanya at Buckland's.
He saw me...

508
00:33:12,516 --> 00:33:13,642
With Prue.

509
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:20,941
Hey, last one out gets the lights?

510
00:33:22,234 --> 00:33:24,445
I'm going home.

511
00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:29,116
- So lock up when you leave?
- Sure.

512
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:31,452
Prue?

513
00:33:31,869 --> 00:33:33,913
About what I said earlier...

514
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,831
Now isn't a good time.

515
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:38,626
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.

516
00:33:39,126 --> 00:33:40,961
But you wouldn't really mean that,
would you?

517
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,796
No.

518
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,210
Excuse me.

519
00:34:22,377 --> 00:34:25,839
Are you Miss Halliwell?
Prue Halliwell?

520
00:34:26,048 --> 00:34:27,883
Yes. Did we have an appointment?

521
00:34:28,049 --> 00:34:33,180
No. Actually, I'm looking for someone,
and I believe you can help me.

522
00:34:33,346 --> 00:34:35,182
I find objects, not people.

523
00:34:36,683 --> 00:34:41,396
Well, I think you might know her.
I saw you talking to her earlier.

524
00:34:41,563 --> 00:34:44,190
Petite, brown hair.

525
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:46,484
The two of you
were over by the elevators.

526
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,777
I don't remember.

527
00:34:48,528 --> 00:34:49,696
Are you sure?

528
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,197
What do you want with her?

529
00:34:51,406 --> 00:34:53,700
She's hiding the woman
I was sent back to kill.

530
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:56,286
- Sent back from where?
- The future.

531
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,080
- What are you doing?
- Why kill Tanya?

532
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:01,166
I don't want Tanya.

533
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:05,503
I want what's inside her. No!

534
00:35:06,463 --> 00:35:09,549
- And the others, why kill them?
- They were all...

535
00:35:09,716 --> 00:35:12,010
...pieces of the puzzle.

536
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,179
Pieces of the vaccine.

537
00:35:16,556 --> 00:35:18,308
Stop this!

538
00:35:31,446 --> 00:35:34,032
Answer. Come on Prue, pick up.

539
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:36,492
<i>You have reached
Buckland Auction House...</i>

540
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:39,454
There's no answer. It's after 5.
It's going straight to voice mail.

541
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,081
- You have to go to Buckland's.
- I'll grab my keys, grab Tanya.

542
00:35:42,248 --> 00:35:45,543
No. You have to go. Alone.

543
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:47,753
If we bring Tanya with us
and he's there,

544
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,505
it's bringing the feast to the lion.

545
00:35:49,672 --> 00:35:52,550
And she can't stay here
by herself, so...

546
00:35:52,758 --> 00:35:54,552
But I need you, Phoebe.
We need you.

547
00:35:55,178 --> 00:35:57,179
I can't always be the power of three.

548
00:35:57,388 --> 00:35:59,682
But what if he comes here,
and you're all alone?

549
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:01,559
<i>We'll be in the attic with the Book.</i>

550
00:36:02,351 --> 00:36:04,270
- Okay, be careful.
- You too.

551
00:36:34,717 --> 00:36:38,804
I've got eight and a half months
to find Tanya, Miss Halliwell.

552
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:41,223
Plenty of time.

553
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:48,647
Yours, however...

554
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:52,151
...has run out.

555
00:37:03,662 --> 00:37:05,289
Prue?

556
00:37:10,294 --> 00:37:11,336
Oh, no.

557
00:37:18,927 --> 00:37:22,139
You can't hide from me forever.

558
00:37:22,889 --> 00:37:25,892
What's the vaccine for?
What does it protect against?

559
00:37:30,731 --> 00:37:34,276
Against me, of course.

560
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:39,281
And all other warlocks like me...

561
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:41,825
...in the future.

562
00:37:43,618 --> 00:37:49,958
The Parker child will be the one
to bring together all the elements...

563
00:37:51,084 --> 00:37:53,503
...to create...

564
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:58,508
...the vaccine which will destroy us.

565
00:38:02,137 --> 00:38:04,639
Unless I stop him.

566
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,488
Hey. Need a hand?

567
00:38:20,655 --> 00:38:22,615
- Yeah.
- Okay.

568
00:38:23,575 --> 00:38:26,369
He's not after Tanya.
He's after her baby. She's pregnant.

569
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:27,620
Yeah, I know.

570
00:38:27,787 --> 00:38:30,498
- Truth spell. Later. Where's Phoebe?
- Home protecting Tanya.

571
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,667
Well, what are you waiting for, Piper?
Whack him.

572
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:34,919
No. Can't you move him?

573
00:38:35,086 --> 00:38:37,046
Where? He's from the future.

574
00:38:37,213 --> 00:38:39,465
- Prue, he's gonna unfreeze soon.
- Piper, just do it.

575
00:38:39,632 --> 00:38:41,634
- No, you do it.
- No, do it! Piper!

576
00:38:41,843 --> 00:38:43,428
- Just do it!
- Oh, my...

577
00:39:04,907 --> 00:39:07,743
I love it when they clean up
after themselves.

578
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:22,758
- Prue.
- Andy.

579
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:26,095
I need to know how you feel
about what I told you.

580
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:29,849
- I'm gonna need a little more time.
- I don't have time, Andy.

581
00:39:30,015 --> 00:39:31,642
I need to know before 8.

582
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:34,228
- Come inside. We'll talk about it.
- I can't.

583
00:39:34,436 --> 00:39:36,397
- Prue.
- Andy, no.

584
00:39:36,605 --> 00:39:38,524
Look, if I come inside
we'll have drinks,

585
00:39:38,691 --> 00:39:41,318
there'll be small talk,
and precious minutes will pass.

586
00:39:43,237 --> 00:39:45,322
I need to know now.

587
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,785
Can you or can you not
accept that I'm a witch?

588
00:39:53,163 --> 00:39:55,290
If I have to answer right now...

589
00:39:57,876 --> 00:39:59,545
...I don't think so, Prue.

590
00:40:01,338 --> 00:40:03,298
I mean, there's nothing
wrong with it, I guess.

591
00:40:03,465 --> 00:40:07,219
It's just not a future
I envision having.

592
00:40:12,349 --> 00:40:13,767
What were we just talking about?

593
00:40:14,393 --> 00:40:16,728
- You don't remember?
- Honestly, no.

594
00:40:17,646 --> 00:40:21,984
You don't remember anything
you said to me in the last 24 hours?

595
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,071
No. It's really weird.

596
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:29,616
You want to come inside?

597
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:31,910
No.

598
00:40:32,077 --> 00:40:33,954
I have to go.

599
00:40:37,165 --> 00:40:39,000
Goodbye, Andy.

600
00:41:04,275 --> 00:41:06,236
Excuse me.

601
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:10,949
What good is saving the future if I can't
get a glass of water in the present?

602
00:41:11,408 --> 00:41:13,660
Speaking of the future,
where did Tanya go?

603
00:41:13,827 --> 00:41:15,078
She went to the bathroom.

604
00:41:15,286 --> 00:41:17,372
Morning sickness.
Only she thinks it's the halibut.

605
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:20,583
Oh, great. She'll probably sue
the restaurant for food poisoning.

606
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,961
Will this day never end?

607
00:41:23,128 --> 00:41:24,462
Actually, it's just did.

608
00:41:24,671 --> 00:41:29,425
It's 8:20. The spell is over.
The world is a safer place.

609
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:31,636
Piper, I see you sitting.

610
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:33,680
What is wrong with this picture?

611
00:41:33,846 --> 00:41:35,765
- You don't remember?
- Remember what?

612
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:40,520
Piper, I need you in the kitchen,
pronto. We're down a sous-chef.

613
00:41:41,813 --> 00:41:42,855
I don't believe it.

614
00:41:43,064 --> 00:41:47,694
I finally stand up for myself and quit,
and he doesn't even remember.

615
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,071
Wait a minute.
Everybody else has forgotten the truth,

616
00:41:50,238 --> 00:41:52,490
- why do we still remember it?
- Truth or consequences.

617
00:41:52,657 --> 00:41:55,660
Wiccan rule, right? Prue cast a spell
for her own personal gain,

618
00:41:55,827 --> 00:41:57,829
now we have to deal with the fallout.

619
00:41:59,288 --> 00:42:01,165
I'll be right back.

620
00:42:01,332 --> 00:42:03,459
I need to remind Martin of something.

621
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:06,671
You go, girl!

622
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:15,930
Martin, we need to talk.

623
00:42:16,138 --> 00:42:17,723
- Excuse you.
- I cannot...

624
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,309
No, I will not do everything
by myself anymore.

625
00:42:20,476 --> 00:42:22,353
I need help.
Your restaurant needs help.

626
00:42:22,561 --> 00:42:24,230
You need another manager,
sous-chef,

627
00:42:24,397 --> 00:42:26,148
hostess and an extra busboy
on the weekends.

628
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:30,152
If you will not agree to hire these
people, then tell me now and I'll quit.

629
00:42:31,570 --> 00:42:34,323
Honey, what took you so long?
All you had to do was ask.

630
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:38,536
Really? I mean, okay.
I'll see you tomorrow.

631
00:42:38,744 --> 00:42:40,579
But I just...

632
00:42:41,247 --> 00:42:43,082
It's my night off.

633
00:42:47,419 --> 00:42:50,673
Oh, Leo! I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

634
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:53,300
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just surprised.

635
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:56,053
Yeah, me too.
What are you doing here?

636
00:42:56,679 --> 00:43:00,224
Well, I wanted to see you. I just...

637
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:02,768
I have this really strange feeling

638
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:05,646
that I did something
I should apologize for.

639
00:43:07,439 --> 00:43:09,817
- Did I?
- No.

640
00:43:09,983 --> 00:43:12,611
No. Not at all.

641
00:43:12,778 --> 00:43:14,655
Definitely not.

642
00:43:15,572 --> 00:43:17,616
Can I buy you a drink?

643
00:43:23,664 --> 00:43:26,667
- Hey.
- Hey. How'd it go?

644
00:43:27,751 --> 00:43:30,337
- Not well.
- Oh, Prue, I'm so sorry.

645
00:43:30,504 --> 00:43:35,634
Yeah, me too. But I cast a spell
for an answer, and I got it.

646
00:43:35,926 --> 00:43:37,844
Even if it wasn't the one that I wanted.
