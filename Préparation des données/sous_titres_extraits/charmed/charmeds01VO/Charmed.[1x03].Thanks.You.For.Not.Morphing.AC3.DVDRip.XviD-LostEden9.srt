1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:09,217
So we're agreed, 20 minutes?

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:11,053
Prue, you can't do a party
in 20 minutes.

3
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:12,721
- Watch me.
- Prue's party tips:

4
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:13,972
Meet, greet and bail.

5
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:16,099
Hey, I'm sorry, but some of us
have a job.

6
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,768
And some of us have fun.

7
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:19,853
And some of us are having
a really bad hair day.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,731
You know, that is a sign.
Let's turn back now before it's too late.

9
00:00:22,898 --> 00:00:27,068
- Prue, it's never too late for a party.
- It's never too late, Prue.

10
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,945
Remember my sweet 16?

11
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:40,707
Hey, I have an idea.

12
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,876
Why don't we throw a party
and charge admission.

13
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:46,046
- It's a great way to make extra cash.
- Hey, I have an even better idea:

14
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,340
Why don't you just get a job.

15
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,182
The sisters Halliwell.
Now the party can begin.

16
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:01,269
- It's about time you chicks showed.
- Hey, Prue, I'm glad you made it.

17
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,021
Wouldn't miss it for the world, Fritz.

18
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,398
- Marshall, the place looks great.
- Thank you.

19
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,818
We're mostly just restoring it.
I didn't wanna change it too much.

20
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,653
You guys knew the old owners,
didn't you?

21
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,489
Oh, we basically grew up
with their kids.

22
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,325
We probably know the house
better than you guys.

23
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,412
- Hey, how's the bar?
- Oh, dry. I'll take care of it.

24
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:23,124
No. My turn.

25
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,297
Try and behave, Cynda.
We have guests.

26
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:32,050
- You know, sisters.
- Tell me about it.

27
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,678
So, listen, enjoy the party.

28
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,264
- Okay.
- Okay.

29
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,269
Okay, I came, I saw, I was perky.

30
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:46,314
Now I just want my head on a pillow
because I have to wake up early.

31
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:48,900
No. I mean, not yet.

32
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:52,570
Yeah, Prue, we just got here.
It wouldn't look good.

33
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,866
- All right, what's going on?
- Going on? What do you mean?

34
00:01:59,118 --> 00:02:02,705
What a coinkidink. Look who's here.

35
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,876
Phoebe, you didn't.

36
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:09,545
Your fingers weren't doing the walking.
Somebody's had to.

37
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:12,923
We've been through this, okay?
Cop, witch. It's not a love connection.

38
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:15,718
Boy, girl. Lighten up.

39
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:21,807
Hi, Andy.

40
00:02:21,974 --> 00:02:24,310
We're working on their subtlety.

41
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,563
Then it's on to ending hunger
and creating world peace, right?

42
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:31,025
- What will I do with my Saturday?
- Funny you should ask.

43
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,611
I don't mean to push it,
but I was wondering...

44
00:02:33,777 --> 00:02:36,405
If you're not doing anything,
I kind of have these tickets,

45
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,450
but they're for a Warriors game.
You probably wouldn't be interested.

46
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:41,952
Well, the team can't do any worse
than they did last year.

47
00:02:42,119 --> 00:02:44,038
Did you see them get creamed
by the Lakers?

48
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:46,957
Impressive. Is that a yes?

49
00:02:49,168 --> 00:02:52,421
You know, I need to check
my book,

50
00:02:52,588 --> 00:02:54,590
because I might have a thing.

51
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:56,341
A thing?

52
00:02:56,508 --> 00:03:00,596
- So, Prue, I hear your friend's a cop.
- Inspector, actually.

53
00:03:00,762 --> 00:03:03,849
Oh, yeah. Well,
I got these parking tickets...

54
00:03:04,016 --> 00:03:06,393
Well, my focus is mainly
homicide and robbery.

55
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,896
Yeah, yeah.

56
00:03:09,479 --> 00:03:11,982
- So I have these parking tickets...
- Gotta go.

57
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,319
- Maybe you could...
- Hey, Prue, wait.

58
00:03:19,406 --> 00:03:21,199
Hey, man.

59
00:03:48,727 --> 00:03:50,353
Phoebe.

60
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:18,375
How big was this dog again?

61
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:20,919
Huge. Did you see the scratches
on the attic door?

62
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:22,462
What was it doing in the house?

63
00:06:22,629 --> 00:06:25,382
I don't know. Someone obviously
left the front door open again.

64
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:28,635
Why do you always assume
it was me? What about Piper?

65
00:06:28,844 --> 00:06:30,345
- Not it.
- Well, it's not a big deal.

66
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:32,305
We checked the house,
and nothing is missing

67
00:06:32,472 --> 00:06:34,933
except my Pat Boone
Christmas CD.

68
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:38,311
No, this is really creepy.
If there was a dog in the house,

69
00:06:38,478 --> 00:06:39,646
then it had to have an owner.

70
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:42,774
No dog I know can open that
front door, let alone reach top shelf.

71
00:06:42,941 --> 00:06:44,651
Hey, maybe we should get
a security system.

72
00:06:44,818 --> 00:06:47,362
No, they are way too expensive.
Besides, after what happened,

73
00:06:47,529 --> 00:06:50,490
Andy will be checking on us
every five minutes.

74
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,285
- You told him.
- Convenient.

75
00:06:53,868 --> 00:06:55,787
- So, what should we do?
- Well,

76
00:06:55,954 --> 00:06:58,957
either we could rely on
our vicious guard cat to protect us,

77
00:06:59,124 --> 00:07:02,419
or we could remember
to lock the doors.

78
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:07,132
That is a really good idea, Prue.

79
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:10,969
Yep.

80
00:07:15,765 --> 00:07:17,642
Unlock the door, Phoebe.

81
00:07:31,114 --> 00:07:34,117
I was told that you might
be able to help me.

82
00:07:36,452 --> 00:07:38,037
I'd like to have this...

83
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:40,373
...appraised.

84
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,042
Well, you would be better off
going to the house's appraiser.

85
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:45,503
I've been there. He'd need a week.

86
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,088
And I just...

87
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:51,008
Well, I wouldn't feel right without it.
It's a family heirloom.

88
00:07:51,342 --> 00:07:53,302
I feel like...

89
00:07:55,388 --> 00:07:58,015
I think I've seen a ring
similar to this before.

90
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,980
The setting's quite old.
At least 17th century.

91
00:08:04,605 --> 00:08:07,316
The stones look like chrysolite.

92
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:10,820
Keep in mind this is just
an educated guess.

93
00:08:10,987 --> 00:08:14,532
Please, guess away.

94
00:08:14,949 --> 00:08:17,034
If I am not mistaken,

95
00:08:17,243 --> 00:08:19,870
it's a stone that the Egyptians
believed would protect them

96
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:23,040
against spells, curses,
evil spirits.

97
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:26,627
This wouldn't be a wedding band
by any chance, would it?

98
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:30,047
- You tell me.
- The stones are set in twos,

99
00:08:30,214 --> 00:08:32,424
the symbol of duality.

100
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:35,344
Man, woman.

101
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:38,639
- Again, protection.
- And what does all that tell you?

102
00:08:42,268 --> 00:08:44,478
Where did you get this ring?

103
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:47,064
What did you say your name was?

104
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:50,234
I think you know what my name is...

105
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,486
...Prudence.

106
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:58,534
Get out and stay away from us.

107
00:09:04,373 --> 00:09:06,166
I'm staying at the Beaumark.

108
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,794
What do you say you and your sisters
join me for dinner.

109
00:09:09,586 --> 00:09:11,213
Let's say tomorrow night.

110
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,925
- We can talk.
- After how you abandoned us?

111
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,802
- How dare you.
- Fiery temper.

112
00:09:17,553 --> 00:09:19,221
I like that.

113
00:09:19,388 --> 00:09:23,308
- It reminds me of someone I know.
- I'm nothing like you.

114
00:09:23,475 --> 00:09:26,228
I would never leave my responsibilities
and my family.

115
00:09:26,436 --> 00:09:28,605
I can see we have some issues
to work through.

116
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:31,692
No, we've got
the whole subscription.

117
00:09:32,651 --> 00:09:34,611
Now get out,
before I have you thrown out.

118
00:09:35,153 --> 00:09:38,365
Is that any way to talk to your father?

119
00:09:59,844 --> 00:10:03,682
I wonder why he went to you first.
I mean, why not Phoebe? Or me?

120
00:10:03,848 --> 00:10:05,684
Piper, it's not like I won the lotto.

121
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,520
What was he like?
Did he ask about us?

122
00:10:08,728 --> 00:10:10,563
Actually, no.

123
00:10:11,398 --> 00:10:13,608
Phoebe, think about it.
He abandoned us.

124
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:15,110
He was a no-show for 20 years,

125
00:10:15,276 --> 00:10:17,695
and then what, suddenly here he is?
Why now?

126
00:10:17,904 --> 00:10:19,989
Maybe he just wants to be
a part of our lives.

127
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:22,325
After all this time?
Don't get your hopes up.

128
00:10:22,492 --> 00:10:24,410
Well, there's only one way to find out.

129
00:10:24,953 --> 00:10:26,663
Why wait till dinner?
Let's go see him now.

130
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:28,665
Will you be rational?

131
00:10:28,832 --> 00:10:31,960
Don't you find it just a little suspicious
that just when we find out...?

132
00:10:32,126 --> 00:10:33,836
Let me get that for you.

133
00:10:36,422 --> 00:10:39,217
Just when we find out
we're witches, he shows up?

134
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:41,886
But when Mom dies,
he's nowhere to be found.

135
00:10:42,095 --> 00:10:44,889
- He sent us birthday cards.
- Selective memory?

136
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:49,727
Grams always told us
he was a threat to us.

137
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:52,230
There's no reason to think
that that's changed.

138
00:10:52,397 --> 00:10:57,777
Prue, it's not that I don't see your
point, but you knew him, we didn't.

139
00:10:57,944 --> 00:10:59,904
Why can't we have a chance
to know him now?

140
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:04,909
Because we really don't know
why he's here.

141
00:11:05,076 --> 00:11:07,036
And until we do, we can't trust him.

142
00:11:20,007 --> 00:11:21,884
<i>Entrez.</i>

143
00:11:40,361 --> 00:11:41,529
Daddy?

144
00:11:45,324 --> 00:11:47,451
Well, well.

145
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:50,329
What a nice surprise.

146
00:11:50,496 --> 00:11:53,082
I'm sorry to just show up like this.
I know I was supposed

147
00:11:53,249 --> 00:11:57,878
- to wait for dinner, but I...
- No. Nonsense. Welcome.

148
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:00,297
Let me get a good look at you.

149
00:12:02,424 --> 00:12:04,051
This is my baby girl.

150
00:12:04,426 --> 00:12:06,095
Little...

151
00:12:09,473 --> 00:12:11,183
...Piper?

152
00:12:14,353 --> 00:12:16,104
Phoebe.

153
00:12:17,105 --> 00:12:18,732
Yeah.

154
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:22,152
That's okay. People confuse us
all the time.

155
00:12:22,361 --> 00:12:25,948
Are you kidding? I should be
slapped and persecuted.

156
00:12:26,114 --> 00:12:28,659
Let me make it up to you.
How about some room service?

157
00:12:28,825 --> 00:12:31,578
- I just ate, actually.
- A drink? You are legal, right?

158
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:33,956
Barely, but no, thanks.

159
00:12:34,164 --> 00:12:37,292
- A massage? I can call Lucy back.
- No, really.

160
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:38,877
I don't want anything.

161
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,218
I just wanted to look at you.

162
00:12:50,305 --> 00:12:53,099
It's like looking in a mirror, isn't it?

163
00:12:53,391 --> 00:12:55,727
You've got your daddy's eyes,
you know that?

164
00:12:57,145 --> 00:12:59,314
I noticed that.

165
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:04,486
How about a hug?

166
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,263
- They always manage to find me.
- You know, it's okay, I...

167
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,682
I'll just see you at dinner. I gotta go.

168
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,894
Phoebe.

169
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:39,729
Phoebe, wait.

170
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:53,612
Andy, what are you doing here?

171
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,158
- Door was open.
- Again?

172
00:15:58,366 --> 00:16:02,037
Yeah, I came by to check up,
and it was open.

173
00:16:02,245 --> 00:16:04,915
I looked around.
Everything seems to be in order.

174
00:16:05,874 --> 00:16:07,709
You want me to check upstairs?

175
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:11,922
No, no. That's okay, really.

176
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:19,888
Oh, and about tomorrow night,
I've changed my mind.

177
00:16:20,096 --> 00:16:21,723
- We're on.
- Excuse me?

178
00:16:22,223 --> 00:16:26,853
Well, you'll never believe who popped
back into my life after 20 years.

179
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,396
Victor, my dad.

180
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,107
- Your dad?
- Yeah, he wants to have dinner,

181
00:16:31,274 --> 00:16:33,067
and I would really rather avoid that.

182
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:35,195
Too bad the game's not tonight.

183
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:39,616
- Hi, Cynda.
- Hey.

184
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,410
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

185
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:46,289
- Bye.
- Nice party last night.

186
00:16:47,624 --> 00:16:49,876
Guess I'll get going too.

187
00:17:23,701 --> 00:17:26,579
What the hell?

188
00:17:36,964 --> 00:17:39,550
- Prue, you don't know for sure.
- I know plenty.

189
00:17:39,717 --> 00:17:41,594
First, someone rips off the attic door,

190
00:17:41,761 --> 00:17:43,596
<i>then the Book of Shadows
is found downstairs.</i>

191
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:45,181
Isn't that enough?

192
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:48,142
<i>Why would somebody want
the Book? Here.</i>

193
00:17:48,309 --> 00:17:50,644
Well, for one reason,
they know what it can do.

194
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:53,063
They want its power, our power.

195
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:55,191
But that would mean it's someone
who knows us

196
00:17:55,357 --> 00:17:56,984
and knows that we're witches.

197
00:17:57,193 --> 00:18:00,321
- Yeah, someone like Victor.
- What? Dad?

198
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:02,781
Look, just think about it.
The moment he shows up,

199
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:05,200
<i>someone makes two attempts
to grab the Book.</i>

200
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:08,829
- Coincidence? I think not.
- The craft is a chick thing, Prue.

201
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,123
It's passed on down through
the female line.

202
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,709
There's a good chance Dad
doesn't even know we're charmed.

203
00:18:13,917 --> 00:18:16,712
And there's just as good of a chance
he does.

204
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:22,676
<i>What would he want with the Book?
And why would he take it from us?</i>

205
00:18:25,179 --> 00:18:26,555
Phoebe, help me out here.

206
00:18:28,557 --> 00:18:30,976
- Phoebe.
- Okay.

207
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:34,313
Let's just say
for the sake of argument

208
00:18:34,479 --> 00:18:37,566
that he is after it.
Wouldn't he have taken it with him?

209
00:18:37,733 --> 00:18:39,151
He wouldn't have left it behind.

210
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:42,279
Okay, we have to call the cops
and report it as a break-in.

211
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:43,530
And tell them what?

212
00:18:43,947 --> 00:18:46,658
That someone broke into our house
to try and steal our broomsticks?

213
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:49,244
I mean, please. Besides,
Andy's already been here.

214
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:53,582
Oh, so Andy was here again.
Talk about convenient.

215
00:18:53,749 --> 00:18:56,043
Did you ever think
of pointing the finger at him?

216
00:18:56,334 --> 00:18:58,545
He's probably the one
who scared Victor away.

217
00:18:58,754 --> 00:19:02,507
Until we find out what's going on
and whether Victor is involved or not,

218
00:19:02,966 --> 00:19:04,342
<i>we've got to hide the Book.</i>

219
00:19:04,509 --> 00:19:06,887
Either that, or we can't leave
the house.

220
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:09,848
<i>Fine. Then we hide the Book,
because I'm going to dinner tonight.</i>

221
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:12,601
- I wanna see Dad.
- So do I.

222
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,769
I've already seen him.

223
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,861
Girls, it's so nice to see you.

224
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:25,071
It's not like we don't have
a lot to talk about.

225
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,865
We do.

226
00:19:27,032 --> 00:19:30,452
I mean, yeah,
we have a few questions.

227
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:33,747
You know, the last time
we ate together,

228
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:35,707
you would only eat food
that was white.

229
00:19:35,915 --> 00:19:40,044
- I'm glad to see you've outgrown it.
- That's right. I was 4.

230
00:19:40,628 --> 00:19:43,089
And, Phoebe, that would've
made you what, 1?

231
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:47,635
You know, you couldn't walk yet,
but you could swim.

232
00:19:47,802 --> 00:19:49,220
You were a fish.

233
00:19:53,266 --> 00:19:55,143
This feels right, doesn't it?

234
00:19:55,476 --> 00:19:58,146
It feels natural. Almost like normal.

235
00:19:58,354 --> 00:20:01,357
Almost. It's just...

236
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:06,362
Well, why? I mean, after all this time,
why here, why now?

237
00:20:06,904 --> 00:20:08,614
Well, I heard the food
is pretty good here.

238
00:20:08,906 --> 00:20:10,867
And it is dinnertime.

239
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,288
- Here you are, ma'am.
- Thank you.

240
00:20:16,539 --> 00:20:18,332
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

241
00:20:33,889 --> 00:20:36,309
My plans for tonight fell through.
Figured I'd stop by.

242
00:20:49,155 --> 00:20:52,450
And then, all of a sudden, there
he was. He just showed up at work.

243
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:54,827
I can't believe it.
How are you dealing?

244
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:58,122
Honestly, I'm not.

245
00:20:58,289 --> 00:20:59,582
I don't blame you.

246
00:21:00,124 --> 00:21:03,002
- What do you think he wants?
- Dinner.

247
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:05,921
Piper and Phoebe
are there with him now.

248
00:21:06,589 --> 00:21:08,465
You know,
they just don't understand.

249
00:21:08,966 --> 00:21:10,509
They don't know him like I do.

250
00:21:11,218 --> 00:21:13,721
I can't believe I let them go.

251
00:21:14,638 --> 00:21:15,973
I can't believe they went.

252
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:21,311
He's acting like no time has passed,
like I'm still his little girl, and I'm not.

253
00:21:23,272 --> 00:21:26,024
There are things
that I wanna tell him.

254
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,653
I want him to know what he missed.
You know, like...

255
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:31,989
...the time I broke my arm.

256
00:21:32,156 --> 00:21:35,409
Or the day that I finally passed
my driver's test. Our prom.

257
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:38,120
Didn't we miss that too?

258
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:45,252
I want him to know.

259
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:48,130
I want him to want to know.

260
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,633
And I'm sorry, but I also want
some answers.

261
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:54,636
Like, where the hell has he been
my whole life?

262
00:21:54,803 --> 00:21:57,180
Why didn't he come back until now?

263
00:21:57,347 --> 00:21:59,599
He needs to know
that that's not okay.

264
00:21:59,808 --> 00:22:01,059
So tell him.

265
00:22:04,229 --> 00:22:05,689
I'll drop you off.

266
00:22:18,952 --> 00:22:20,245
Prudence.

267
00:22:22,455 --> 00:22:24,249
Did I miss much?

268
00:22:24,457 --> 00:22:27,377
Just catch-up. Dad was filling us in.

269
00:22:27,544 --> 00:22:28,878
- Memory lane.
- Has he mentioned

270
00:22:29,045 --> 00:22:31,256
- where he's been all of our lives?
- Prue.

271
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:34,342
I don't understand.
If you can afford a spread like this,

272
00:22:34,509 --> 00:22:37,178
why didn't you help out
when Grams died?

273
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:39,973
- We actually could've used it then.
- Give him a chance, Prue.

274
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:42,267
Dad's explained.
The money, all this, it's new.

275
00:22:42,475 --> 00:22:44,436
It's okay, Piper, I'm a big boy.

276
00:22:45,019 --> 00:22:48,022
I didn't come back earlier because
I was afraid I might disappoint you.

277
00:22:48,231 --> 00:22:50,984
- Too late.
- Wonder what's keeping that dessert.

278
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:54,195
Please, sit down.
Have something to eat.

279
00:22:54,404 --> 00:22:57,323
- I'm not hungry.
- Always in a hurry, Prue.

280
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:59,659
You skipped crawling
and went straight to walking.

281
00:22:59,826 --> 00:23:01,869
Oh, we're sharing memories.

282
00:23:02,036 --> 00:23:04,664
Well, I've got one of my own.
Your back, walking out the door.

283
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:31,482
- Who wants flambé?
- Nice reflexes.

284
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:36,237
Now, let me get this straight.
Piper, you freeze time.

285
00:23:36,487 --> 00:23:39,282
Prue, don't you move objects?

286
00:23:40,658 --> 00:23:43,286
And what's your special trick, Phoebe?
Premonitions?

287
00:23:45,246 --> 00:23:48,082
Maybe we should
talk about this elsewhere.

288
00:24:10,771 --> 00:24:13,023
- What are you doing here?
- What do you think?

289
00:24:13,732 --> 00:24:17,403
- Get out. Now.
- No. You've gotta get out.

290
00:24:17,611 --> 00:24:20,572
- We've got it under control.
- No, you don't.

291
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:23,117
Because they're on their way back.

292
00:24:24,034 --> 00:24:25,411
I thought you were in charge.

293
00:24:25,619 --> 00:24:28,539
<i>Look, shape-shift into yourselves,
and we'll get back to the Book later.</i>

294
00:24:28,706 --> 00:24:32,668
- Nice plan, Marshall.
- Don't piss me off, Fritz.

295
00:24:32,876 --> 00:24:35,504
How was I supposed to know Prue
would come back with her sisters?

296
00:24:35,712 --> 00:24:38,382
The little witch was supposed to be
out on a date with that cop.

297
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:40,717
You really think you would've
been able to trick Prue

298
00:24:40,884 --> 00:24:42,761
<i>into getting the Book
out of the house?</i>

299
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:46,890
Well, we sure as hell can't now,
can we?

300
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:48,934
So, what now, genius?

301
00:24:50,936 --> 00:24:53,272
We kill them.

302
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,910
Cynda, heel.

303
00:25:09,454 --> 00:25:11,790
Plenty of time for that later.

304
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:14,209
Heel.

305
00:25:30,642 --> 00:25:32,435
Friends of yours?

306
00:25:42,904 --> 00:25:45,365
So someone left a window open,
which is probably how

307
00:25:45,532 --> 00:25:47,826
the birds got in.
What is so funny?

308
00:25:47,992 --> 00:25:50,954
Do you remember the day
this was taken?

309
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:54,040
Yeah. Family picnic. It rained.

310
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:56,543
And your mother packed us all up,
and she brought us home.

311
00:25:56,709 --> 00:25:59,295
And we had the picnic
right here in the living room.

312
00:25:59,462 --> 00:26:01,464
- You remember that, Prue?
- Barely.

313
00:26:01,673 --> 00:26:03,174
Prue.

314
00:26:05,552 --> 00:26:07,220
This one.

315
00:26:08,471 --> 00:26:12,392
This one was at
one of your piano recitals.

316
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:15,144
Not a very good shot. My fault.

317
00:26:16,229 --> 00:26:18,064
I had to take the pictures that day.

318
00:26:18,231 --> 00:26:21,109
Your mother was too busy
holding her breath.

319
00:26:21,984 --> 00:26:24,278
If you look closely...

320
00:26:24,445 --> 00:26:27,406
You see there? That's her.

321
00:26:27,865 --> 00:26:30,326
I never noticed that before.

322
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:38,793
And this one used to be a 5-by-7.

323
00:26:39,126 --> 00:26:41,337
When I was still in it.

324
00:26:43,923 --> 00:26:45,758
I think Grams cut you out.

325
00:26:45,967 --> 00:26:47,718
There's a bunch of other stuff
in the attic.

326
00:26:47,885 --> 00:26:49,720
Grams left us so many things.

327
00:26:49,929 --> 00:26:52,848
- That's not all she left us.
- Phoebe, let's not go there.

328
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:55,226
What? It's not like he doesn't
already know.

329
00:26:55,434 --> 00:26:58,604
And I'm sorry, but it's kind of a relief
to talk to someone about it.

330
00:26:58,896 --> 00:27:00,856
Does anybody want coffee?

331
00:27:01,023 --> 00:27:03,400
I mean, one day I'm a member
of the Y generation

332
00:27:03,609 --> 00:27:06,445
with average hair and a thing
for caffeinated beverages,

333
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:08,781
and the next, I am a witch.

334
00:27:09,573 --> 00:27:12,368
Dad, do you take cream
or sugar with that?

335
00:27:12,535 --> 00:27:16,121
<i>I just read from the Book,
and wham, I am Tabitha.</i>

336
00:27:16,872 --> 00:27:20,251
The only thing is, is I got stuck
with the power to see the future.

337
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,961
- How uncool is that?
- Well,

338
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:24,630
from what your mother always said,
it was actually considered

339
00:27:24,797 --> 00:27:26,548
one of the more desirable powers.

340
00:27:26,924 --> 00:27:29,051
Unless you see things
you don't desire.

341
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:34,014
So how long have you known?
About us, our powers. How long?

342
00:27:34,223 --> 00:27:35,557
I didn't.

343
00:27:35,724 --> 00:27:38,310
I knew there was a possibility.

344
00:27:38,477 --> 00:27:39,895
That's why I came back.

345
00:27:40,104 --> 00:27:43,232
To find out. Must've happened
when your grandmother died, right?

346
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,318
<i>Yep. I just read an incantation
from the Book, and...</i>

347
00:27:46,485 --> 00:27:48,195
Phoebe.

348
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,491
<i>The Book of Shadows.
Not exactly summer reading.</i>

349
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:57,120
Is it still up in the attic?
You know, I haven't seen it in years.

350
00:27:57,663 --> 00:27:58,956
Mind if I have a look?

351
00:28:08,215 --> 00:28:11,802
- Disappointed.
- Patience, my sweet.

352
00:28:11,968 --> 00:28:14,096
Patience is highly overrated.

353
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:15,847
We could've destroyed them
right there.

354
00:28:16,014 --> 00:28:18,517
<i>Then we'd have three dead witches
and no way to get the Book.</i>

355
00:28:18,683 --> 00:28:20,852
- Where would that put us?
- Satisfied.

356
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:24,606
<i>I still like my idea. We kill two of them
and force the third to get the Book out.</i>

357
00:28:24,773 --> 00:28:27,817
Let me explain this once again
for the cerebrally impaired.

358
00:28:27,984 --> 00:28:30,445
These are not schoolgirls
we're dealing with.

359
00:28:30,654 --> 00:28:32,447
These are good witches.

360
00:28:32,614 --> 00:28:36,117
We cannot alert them
to our presence.

361
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:39,204
At their full strength, battling them...

362
00:28:39,371 --> 00:28:43,249
<i>...would be unpleasant. However,
once we possess the Book,</i>

363
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,251
we get its powers.

364
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:48,588
We weaken theirs,
and they're easy prey.

365
00:28:49,047 --> 00:28:52,884
You know, that sounds good
in theory,

366
00:28:53,093 --> 00:28:54,969
but we've already tried everything.

367
00:28:57,931 --> 00:29:00,183
We still have Victor.

368
00:29:00,391 --> 00:29:02,185
What exactly are you
accusing me of, Prue?

369
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:04,479
- Figure it out.
- Come on, Prue, take it easy.

370
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:06,022
Are you kidding me?

371
00:29:06,189 --> 00:29:08,650
Am I the only one who sees
what's going on here?

372
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:10,485
Couldn't we all just take
a deep breath...?

373
00:29:10,652 --> 00:29:13,613
Think about it, Piper.
What, he wines and dines us,

374
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,157
now he's back in a house
he hasn't set foot in in 20 years,

375
00:29:16,324 --> 00:29:19,077
<i>and the first thing he wants to know is
where's the Book of Shadows?</i>

376
00:29:19,243 --> 00:29:22,622
You're just looking for something
to blame him for.

377
00:29:22,789 --> 00:29:24,415
Admit it.

378
00:29:24,874 --> 00:29:27,919
- Tell them why you're here.
- Prue, stop.

379
00:29:28,669 --> 00:29:31,923
For the first time in your life,
Victor, tell them the truth.

380
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,717
All right, fine.

381
00:29:36,052 --> 00:29:39,806
<i>You're right. I am after the Book.</i>

382
00:29:39,972 --> 00:29:42,808
That's exactly the reason
why I came back.

383
00:29:43,518 --> 00:29:44,560
Dad?

384
00:29:44,727 --> 00:29:47,647
But not for the reasons
you would like to believe.

385
00:29:49,106 --> 00:29:52,652
That would make it easy for you,
Prue, wouldn't it? If I were evil?

386
00:29:52,818 --> 00:29:55,029
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you,
I'm not.

387
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:57,615
- I'm here to protect you.
- Yeah, right.

388
00:29:57,782 --> 00:30:00,951
- To protect us from what?
- From yourselves.

389
00:30:01,118 --> 00:30:04,038
That's why I want that damn book.

390
00:30:04,205 --> 00:30:08,042
It's where the power of three started.
And it's where it must end.

391
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,086
But it's part of us,
it's part of who we are.

392
00:30:10,252 --> 00:30:12,713
That's what your mother
believed too.

393
00:30:13,756 --> 00:30:15,466
Before they killed her.

394
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:17,801
- What are you saying?
- You have no idea

395
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:21,222
- what evil is out there.
- Oh, I think we've got a good idea.

396
00:30:21,388 --> 00:30:24,725
Listen to me, Prue.
That book is a magnet for evil.

397
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:30,731
As long as you have it, as long
as you use it, you're in danger.

398
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:33,067
- All of you.
- You are unbelievable.

399
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,110
After all these years of being
an absentee dad,

400
00:30:35,277 --> 00:30:37,988
then you waltz back into our lives
and try and tell us how to live?

401
00:30:38,155 --> 00:30:40,532
I never wanted you to have
those powers in the first place.

402
00:30:40,699 --> 00:30:43,744
I battled with your grandmother
after your mom died.

403
00:30:43,952 --> 00:30:47,915
She wanted you to find out you were
witches when you grew up. I didn't.

404
00:30:48,081 --> 00:30:51,668
I fought for you. Hard.

405
00:30:52,169 --> 00:30:54,379
Your grandmother was too strong.

406
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:57,883
Wait, you're blaming Grams
for why you disappeared?

407
00:30:58,050 --> 00:31:01,345
- She loved us. She raised us.
- What'd she do, put a spell on you?

408
00:31:01,511 --> 00:31:05,015
Believe me, nothing short of that
would've kept me away.

409
00:31:05,223 --> 00:31:09,895
You have to believe me.
All I want is what's best for you.

410
00:31:14,149 --> 00:31:17,486
Phoebe, you believe me, don't you?

411
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:25,619
- We've done fine without you.
- Prue, you can't fight this.

412
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:27,704
- I couldn't.
- I'm not you.

413
00:31:27,913 --> 00:31:29,247
Are you sure?

414
00:31:29,456 --> 00:31:32,125
Are you sure you can protect
your sisters forever?

415
00:31:32,334 --> 00:31:34,961
- We'll protect each other.
- Then you'll die together.

416
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,339
No one can hurt us as bad as you.

417
00:31:54,939 --> 00:31:57,776
If you wanted me to leave,

418
00:31:57,942 --> 00:32:00,153
all you had to do...

419
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,072
...was ask.

420
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,334
Why did you have to do that?

421
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,295
- Did you have to throw him so hard?
- Piper.

422
00:32:17,462 --> 00:32:20,965
We could've just, you know,
talked about it, like normal people.

423
00:32:21,257 --> 00:32:23,217
We're not normal.

424
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,336
Hello, Victor.

425
00:32:59,253 --> 00:33:02,923
- Where have you been?
- How did you get in here?

426
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:07,261
I think that you should be
a little more concerned with...

427
00:33:07,428 --> 00:33:09,638
...what we're doing in here.

428
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:15,311
I was wondering when evil
would rear its ugly head.

429
00:33:15,478 --> 00:33:18,063
Consider it reared.
I don't know the kind of people

430
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:22,193
you're used to dealing with,
but I'd lay serious coin

431
00:33:22,359 --> 00:33:25,779
that they aren't willing
to rip you into a thousand pieces

432
00:33:25,946 --> 00:33:27,948
and dance in your entrails.

433
00:33:28,115 --> 00:33:30,784
Oh, so you're lawyers.

434
00:33:30,993 --> 00:33:33,329
And here I was assuming
you were shape-shifters.

435
00:33:33,495 --> 00:33:36,332
Those are clever words for a man
about to be an appetizer.

436
00:33:36,498 --> 00:33:39,710
Cocky words for a man who can't get
a simple book out of a house.

437
00:33:39,877 --> 00:33:41,962
Close your mouth.
I mean, it's obvious.

438
00:33:42,129 --> 00:33:45,132
You're gonna shape-shift into me
and try to get to the girls that way.

439
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:47,217
Am I right?

440
00:33:47,426 --> 00:33:49,219
- It won't work.
- Why not?

441
00:33:49,428 --> 00:33:51,513
- Do you mind if I poke holes?
- Poke away.

442
00:33:51,722 --> 00:33:55,434
After tonight, the girls won't let me
or anything that looks like me

443
00:33:55,642 --> 00:33:57,394
back into their lives,
let alone the house.

444
00:33:57,561 --> 00:34:01,356
I've officially been kicked out.
There is, however,

445
00:34:01,523 --> 00:34:05,027
one sister I can reach. Phoebe.

446
00:34:05,194 --> 00:34:08,655
So why don't I just become you,
and I'll reach her?

447
00:34:08,822 --> 00:34:12,034
Because only her real father
would know what buttons to push.

448
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,703
The ones that would get me back in.

449
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:19,082
If you kill me,
you'll never know what they are.

450
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:21,793
You'll never get back into the house...

451
00:34:22,711 --> 00:34:25,380
<i>...and you'll never get
the Book of Shadows.</i>

452
00:34:38,268 --> 00:34:40,562
Good morning, Phoebe.

453
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:47,319
Guys,

454
00:34:47,485 --> 00:34:51,364
can we call a truce
just for five minutes, please?

455
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,783
I have a confession.

456
00:34:54,117 --> 00:34:58,705
Remember when we agreed
to not see Dad?

457
00:34:58,997 --> 00:35:00,999
Yeah, well...

458
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:02,876
...I did.

459
00:35:03,043 --> 00:35:05,795
- Hello, I was with you.
- No.

460
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:08,923
By myself, before dinner.

461
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:15,638
And I had a premonition about Dad
when he hugged me.

462
00:35:16,306 --> 00:35:18,558
<i>He was stealing
the Book of Shadows.</i>

463
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,686
Yeah, you were right
about him, Prue.

464
00:35:22,061 --> 00:35:25,106
But I didn't want the premonition
to be true.

465
00:35:25,773 --> 00:35:27,775
I was hoping,

466
00:35:27,942 --> 00:35:31,779
praying that there was
a perfectly good explanation for it.

467
00:35:31,946 --> 00:35:33,740
Hoping that...

468
00:35:35,658 --> 00:35:39,162
That he was really here
to be with us.

469
00:35:39,829 --> 00:35:42,582
I just wanted him back in our lives.

470
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:47,795
He's our dad.

471
00:35:49,881 --> 00:35:53,134
I know, Phoebe. I know.

472
00:36:03,102 --> 00:36:06,397
Hey. Look.

473
00:36:08,858 --> 00:36:11,569
It's Dad's ring. What's it doing here?

474
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:15,948
It must've slipped off when he...

475
00:36:16,365 --> 00:36:17,825
...fell.

476
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:21,704
Well, I'll have it sent back
to the hotel.

477
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:34,341
Don't be afraid.

478
00:36:34,508 --> 00:36:36,719
What are you...? You have to leave.

479
00:36:36,886 --> 00:36:38,804
Phoebe, please,
this is very important.

480
00:36:39,013 --> 00:36:41,557
I can't. I don't wanna
talk to you anymore.

481
00:36:42,641 --> 00:36:45,644
<i>Phoebe, you gotta get the Book
out of the house.</i>

482
00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:49,023
- You have to leave.
- Phoebe, trust me.

483
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:51,108
Look.

484
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:08,500
Excuse me. Hey.

485
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,586
Is this guy bothering you?

486
00:37:11,211 --> 00:37:13,922
No. This is my...

487
00:37:14,423 --> 00:37:17,843
- This is Victor.
- We were just saying goodbye.

488
00:37:18,051 --> 00:37:20,887
Yeah. I gotta run.

489
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,769
What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?

490
00:37:29,938 --> 00:37:31,523
<i>Dad's not after the Book.
It's Marshall.</i>

491
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,899
- He's what?
- The premonition.

492
00:37:33,108 --> 00:37:34,943
It wasn't Dad. Gotta find a spell
and banish them.

493
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:36,486
- Banish who?
- The neighbours.

494
00:37:36,653 --> 00:37:39,364
They're shape-shifters.
Fritz and Marshall and the...

495
00:37:39,531 --> 00:37:42,242
Cookies. Just baked.

496
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:44,995
Hey. The door was unlocked.

497
00:37:46,872 --> 00:37:50,458
- Where you going, Pheebs?
- Just to get something.

498
00:37:51,001 --> 00:37:53,128
Will you save me a cookie?

499
00:37:54,421 --> 00:37:56,840
- Okay.
- Daddy's home.

500
00:38:03,346 --> 00:38:05,390
Come on, come on.

501
00:38:05,557 --> 00:38:08,518
I have no idea what I'm looking for.

502
00:38:09,477 --> 00:38:11,521
Okay. I can take a hint.

503
00:38:15,108 --> 00:38:18,611
<i>"When in the circle that is home
Safety's gone and evils roam</i>

504
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:23,199
<i>Rid all beings from these walls

505
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:25,994
<i>Rid all beings from these walls
Save sisters three</i>

506
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,329
<i>Now heed our call
Okay.</i>

507
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,297
Dad, you can't be here.
You have to leave now.

508
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:39,132
Whoa! Timeout.
What's going on here?

509
00:38:39,298 --> 00:38:42,051
Don't worry about it, sweetie.
Everything's gonna be fine.

510
00:38:42,218 --> 00:38:43,720
- Don't trust him.
- Wait a sec.

511
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:47,598
Last week, we have no dad,
and now we have two?

512
00:38:47,765 --> 00:38:49,100
Phoebe, remember?

513
00:38:49,267 --> 00:38:53,020
Remember when you were little,
and you were afraid of the dark?

514
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:56,274
And I would leave the hall light on
and the door open just a crack?

515
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,527
Oh, that's original.
What kid isn't afraid of the dark?

516
00:38:59,735 --> 00:39:00,862
Prue.

517
00:39:01,195 --> 00:39:03,531
- She's never been afraid of anything.
- He's right, Prue.

518
00:39:03,698 --> 00:39:06,659
- You were never afraid of the dark.
- Lucky guess.

519
00:39:06,826 --> 00:39:08,828
I said I came back to protect you.

520
00:39:09,036 --> 00:39:11,872
Now there's only one way to do it.
Kill us both.

521
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:15,543
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

522
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:17,753
Just do it, because I wanna go out
with a bang.

523
00:39:17,962 --> 00:39:19,964
- Do it, Phoebe.
- The spell will kill everyone,

524
00:39:20,131 --> 00:39:21,966
including Dad.

525
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,009
This is the only way.

526
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:28,889
- Prudence.
- Prue, the protection ring.

527
00:39:36,856 --> 00:39:38,065
Phoebe, now.

528
00:39:38,274 --> 00:39:40,025
<i>In the circle that is home</i>

529
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:43,904
<i>Safety's gone and evils roam</i>

530
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:45,906
<i>Rid all beings from these walls</i>

00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:49,827

533
00:39:52,121 --> 00:39:54,790
<i>Safety's gone and evils roam</i>

534
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:57,710
- Daddy!
- It's okay. Keep it going.

535
00:39:57,918 --> 00:40:00,546
<i>Rid all beings from these walls</i>

536
00:40:00,713 --> 00:40:03,966
<i>Save sisters three
Now heed our call</i>

537
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:16,687
For a moment there,
I wasn't sure what you would do.

538
00:40:16,853 --> 00:40:18,438
For a moment there, neither was I.

539
00:40:18,605 --> 00:40:20,566
I thought you didn't want us
to use our magic.

540
00:40:20,732 --> 00:40:21,900
I didn't.

541
00:40:22,526 --> 00:40:26,238
Not as long as I still thought of you
as my little girls.

542
00:40:26,405 --> 00:40:28,490
But you're obviously not anymore.

543
00:40:28,949 --> 00:40:33,120
- We're still your little girls. We're just...
- Witches.

544
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:37,332
Yeah. Witches.

545
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:40,919
Who obviously don't need
your old man

546
00:40:41,086 --> 00:40:43,463
to protect you from anything.

547
00:40:58,311 --> 00:41:00,689
No, Andy, I'm fine, really.
Dad's gonna be here any minute,

548
00:41:00,855 --> 00:41:03,024
so can I take a rain check on dinner?

549
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:06,403
Okay, no.
Thanks for the good advice. Bye.

550
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:08,196
So he's "Dad" now?

551
00:41:08,363 --> 00:41:11,199
Yes, Phoebe, he is. And by the way,
my dress looks good on you, but...

552
00:41:11,616 --> 00:41:13,535
I don't have any nice clothes, Prue.

553
00:41:13,743 --> 00:41:15,495
- Dad said it was casual.
- I don't care.

554
00:41:15,662 --> 00:41:17,247
I wanna look nice for him.

555
00:41:17,414 --> 00:41:19,999
Who knows how long it'll be
before we see him again?

556
00:41:20,166 --> 00:41:21,751
You don't think he's gonna
stay around?

557
00:41:21,918 --> 00:41:27,131
Well, let's just say I no longer have
a romanticized image of him,

558
00:41:27,298 --> 00:41:29,884
and I'm glad about that, actually.

559
00:41:30,051 --> 00:41:32,554
At least Dad is real now.

560
00:41:32,762 --> 00:41:35,515
And at least he's not a monster,
which is very reassuring,

561
00:41:35,682 --> 00:41:38,726
considering we share his genes.

562
00:41:39,852 --> 00:41:42,313
I'm just glad he came back,
no matter how long he stays.

563
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,233
Kind of nice feeling like
a normal family again.

564
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,527
Whatever that means.

565
00:41:51,155 --> 00:41:53,366
Speak of the devil.

566
00:41:57,328 --> 00:41:59,080
Hi. You must be Mr Wyatt.

567
00:41:59,956 --> 00:42:01,707
The handyman?

568
00:42:01,916 --> 00:42:03,918
- Call me Leo.
- Gladly.

569
00:42:04,418 --> 00:42:08,130
- This was on the steps.
- Oh, thanks.

570
00:42:08,798 --> 00:42:10,633
This place is...

571
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,510
You don't find many
like this one anymore.

572
00:42:12,718 --> 00:42:16,389
- Yeah, it's kind of falling apart.
- Well, the problem isn't the manor.

573
00:42:16,973 --> 00:42:19,433
It's the manner in which
it was treated.

574
00:42:19,976 --> 00:42:21,644
I'd love to see more if...

575
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:24,772
And I would love to show it to you.

576
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:27,400
The attic is right this way.

577
00:42:27,566 --> 00:42:30,277
- Guys.
- Oh, I'll be right up.

578
00:42:31,612 --> 00:42:34,365
- He's not coming.
- Who's not coming?

579
00:42:34,573 --> 00:42:37,368
Dad. But he sent this.

580
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:39,662
"Girls, something's come up.
I had to leave town.

581
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:43,999
Can't make dinner. Probably best
if we let the dust settle anyway.

582
00:42:44,166 --> 00:42:46,794
I know there's a lot you would like
to forget, but here's

583
00:42:46,961 --> 00:42:48,587
what I remember. Love, Dad."

584
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:55,344
<i>What'd you get? What's in there?
You can open...</i>

585
00:42:58,222 --> 00:43:02,309
<i>- It's like magic!
- A bunny!</i>

586
00:43:02,476 --> 00:43:03,811
<i>What is it?</i>

587
00:43:03,977 --> 00:43:06,271
<i>- Come here, come here, come here.
- What is it?</i>

588
00:43:07,856 --> 00:43:09,650
<i>What is it?</i>

589
00:43:18,116 --> 00:43:19,910
<i>What is it?</i>

590
00:43:20,077 --> 00:43:22,579
<i>- What's in the box?
- Again? Oh, God.</i>

591
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:24,957
<i>A bunny!</i>

592
00:43:27,626 --> 00:43:29,920
Oh, Prudence.

593
00:43:30,420 --> 00:43:33,090
Look at that face.
Look at that face.

594
00:43:33,382 --> 00:43:36,677
<i>- Who is it?
- Hey, Piper.</i>

595
00:43:43,767 --> 00:43:45,227
What's in there?

596
00:43:45,394 --> 00:43:48,021
- What do you got, Phoebe?
- Barbie.

597
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,898
<i>- Yes!
- Barbie!</i>
