1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,330
Joseph!

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,630
Joe!

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:15,460
You're gonna be late!

4
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,260
Oh, look at yourself.

5
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,400
Tuck in your shirt.

6
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,630
Put a comb through your hair,

7
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:55,400
for god's sake.

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,630
Dara's son, he always takes care

9
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,800
of his appearance.

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,730


11
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,900
Meager.

12
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:29,700
It's Mee-gar.

13
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,130
Late again and you're making personal calls?

14
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:32,130
Oh, no, I'm...

15
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:33,160
Who's this?

16
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,560
Nobody.

17
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,660
She your girlfriend?

18
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:36,660
No, she came with the phone.

19
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,800
What are you stalking this girl?

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,160
No.

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,230


22
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360


23
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,460
Are you kidding me?

24
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,330
Aw, come on.

25
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,300
Unbelievable. Two in one week.

26
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:50,700
Your sweep's leaving, Meager.

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,300
Get on it... Or get another gig.

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:59,860


29
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:07,800


30
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,460


31
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,400
Hi, how are you today?

32
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,730
And we're still on

33
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:39,300
- for the regional manager's meeting  - Oh.

34
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,530
Tomorrow at 4:00?

35
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,060
Great.

36
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,200
Yeah, thank you.

37
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,530
Okay, great.

38
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,400
Okay, thank you. Bye-bye.

39
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,760
Oh, I'm so...

40
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,760
I did not mean to interrupt.

41
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,000
No problem.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,030
Don't you usually have

43
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,330
the little tablet thingy with you?

44
00:02:59,330 --> 00:03:01,960
Yeah.

45
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,900
Uh, I usually do.

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,060
Is there something else, or...

47
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,630
I used to be a webelo.

48
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,260
And?

49
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,500
Um, the webelos... Cub scouts?

50
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,330
Your brownie patch.

51
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,130
Oh! Oh, yeah.

52
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,860
No, I...

53
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,600
I actually found that online.

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,300
It's kitschy, right?

55
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,800
I was gonna put it on one of my jackets.

56
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,260
Oh, that's...

57
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,500
Oh, that's, uh... Yeah, that's cool.

58
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,030
Hey, Bethany,

59
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,100
We still on for drinks tonight?

60
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,330
Of course.

61
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,000
You better not keep me out too late this time.

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,030
We'll see.

63
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,300
No, no, no, no.

64
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,700
No, no, please.

65
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,130
Don't do this to me!

66
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,130
No. What happened?

67
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:52,360


68
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
Damn it! Oh, my god!

69
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,900
Do not crash on me.

70
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,160
This is not happening.

71
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,230


72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,630
Hold it! Hold it!

73
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:06,830
Please hold the elevator.

74
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,230
I've got to find an I.T. Guy.

75
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,400
This is a disaster.

76
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,660
Oh, you dropped your ph...

77
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,930


78
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,530


79
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,730
- Are you okay?  - Get away from me!

80
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,430


81
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,860


82
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,130


83
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,100
Oh, no.

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,130
Bethany?

85
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,230
Bethany!

86
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,500


87
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,930


88
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,460


89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,630
Stop it!

90
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,330
Stop it!

91
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,560
I'm telling you because you knew about John

92
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,300
And you didn't say anything, so I trust you.

93
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,660
At least enough for me to not think

94
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,960
you're gonna think I'm crazy.

95
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,960
Oh, of course not.

96
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,660
I saw him last night.

97
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,030
You saw john.

98
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:35,460
Yes, in my kitchen.

99
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,000
Standing about as far from me as you.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,200
Hello, Liv.

101 
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,260 
I grabbed my gun,

102
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:46,260
But he was gone.

103
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,230
I know he wasn't there.

104
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:53,000
Obviously.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,160
I...I just...

106
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,830
Let me see.

107
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,260
You fall in love with your partner...

108
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,200
Who betrays you...

109
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,730
And your country?

110
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,800
He dies in your arms.

111
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,900
Then he shows up in your kitchen

112
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,200
And you're wondering if that's grounds

113
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,460
To rescue yourself.

114
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,260
Yeah, okay, well, we can start with that.

115
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,030
I say no.

116
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,400
You're the one that exposed him.

117
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,430
Bare minimum,

118
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,900
That makes you indispensable.

119
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,960
You want my advice?

120
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,330
Next time John shows up for a nightcap...

121
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,360
Give him one.

122
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,260
- I'm being serious.  - So am I.

123
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,800
You think a few weeks pass

124
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,930
And everything you went through just goes away?

125
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:30,400
Don't fight it.

126
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,760
Don't beat yourself up.

127
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,960
You're good at that.

128
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,600
That's a character flaw.

129
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,030
It'll get easier.

130
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,060
Did she say what it was about?

131
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,330
Olivia? No.

132
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:02,330
She'll tell us when she gets here.

133
00:08:02,330 --> 00:08:03,330
How are you feeling?

134
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,600
Never been better.

135
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,930
Oh? You look quite the opposite.

136
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,700
Maybe that's 'cause I had a little trouble

137
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,400
Sleeping last night.

138
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,060
Oh, I had trouble sleeping myself.

139
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,430
I was thinking about that man.

140
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,660
The one who tortured you.

141
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,960
Something about him.

142
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,930
So familiar.

143
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,100
Peter, when I was in St. Claire's...

144
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,260
We don't have to talk about this.

145
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,300
It's not important.

146
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,000
But it is important.

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
You cannot imagine what it's like

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,600
For a man like me

149
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,560
To not have access to parts of his mind.

150
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,000
You're doing fine, Walter.

151
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,560
Dr.Bishop Peter.

152
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,600
Ah, visiting hours.

153
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,730
Everybody put on their best straight jacket.

154
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,200
At approximately 10:17 a.m.,

155
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,060
A massive power surge struck a downtown high-rise

156
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,560
in Worcester, Massachusetts.

157
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,660
As a result, an elevator on the 26th floor

158
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,600
Plummeted straight to the basement.

159
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,630
Eight passengers died.

160
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,300
Did the cable snap?

161
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,930
That's what's strange.

162
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,260
The elevator didn't fall.

163
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:19,860
It drove itself into the ground.

164
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,130
That's not possible.

165
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,630
Nine months ago, a maglev train in Tokyo

166
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,830
Plowed through a crowded station.

167
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,900
Publicly,

168
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,260
Reported as human error.

169
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,430
In reality, caused by a power surge

170
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,560
Of unknown origin.

171
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,760
Intelligence chatter speculated

172
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,800
That it might be a demonstration

173
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,560
Of a new weapon technology.

174
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,460
It's possible that this morning's event

175
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,830
Was another demonstration.

176
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,100
To override the elevator's circuitry

177
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,900
Would require a... a discharge

178
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,700
Of immense power

179
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,000
And precision.

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,060
I've made arrangements for you

181
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,200
To be received at the building.

182
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,030
We need to know what happened,

183
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:53,030
How it happened,

184
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,160
And who's behind it.

185
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,860
I'm Peter Simmons, the building's engineer.

186
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,330
Olivia Dunham, FBI.

187
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,400
This is my team,

188
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,930
Peter Bishop and Dr. Walter Bishop.

189
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,300
So you've been briefed on what's happened?

190
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,360
Mm-hmm.

191
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,960
Damn elevator powered itself into the floor.

192
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,300
Never seen anything like it.

193
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,660
Shouldn't the brakes have come on automatically?

194
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,030
Well, that's the thing. They did.

195
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:17,630
I mean, the safety's clamped onto the rails all right,

196
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:19,560
But for some reason, the motor just kept going.

197
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,100
Nearly melted the shoes, which is technically...

198
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,360
Impossible?

199
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,760
Yeah, we're seeing a lot of that lately.

200
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,130
You know your elevators.

201
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:27,560
MIT drop-out.

202
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,860
Is there any security camera footage?

203
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,460
Nope. All the cameras frizzed.

204
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,960
Hey, can you people move out of there?

205
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,760
FBI coming through.

206
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,800
So how could an elevator drive itself?

207
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,400
It's almost like another generator came online,

208
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,130
Jacked into the system, and overloaded it

209
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,660
With double or triple the voltage.

210
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,160
Exit wound burns.

211
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:11,430
Subconjuctival hemorrhages.

212
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,360
This woman displays

213
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,630
All of the symptoms of a classic...

214
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,860
Thermoelectric trauma.

215
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,160
What are you two saying?

216
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,000
He's saying that all these people were electrocuted.

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,830
Electrocuted?

218
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:24,000
May I?

219
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,160
That's lovely.

220
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,800
24 carat gold.

221
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,660
Traces of nickel,

222
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:38,360
Possibly cobalt.

223
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:50,960
How are you doing that?

224
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,130
This entire space is charged

225
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,230
With electromagnetic energy.

226
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:57,660
Far beyond that which occurs in nature.

227
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,230
There's still residual magnetic energy

228
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,800
From whatever electrocuted these people.

229
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,730
I need to examine the victims' belongings.

230
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,000
And one of the bodies as well.

231
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,930
Are you saying you may know how this happened?

232
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,530
No, not yet.

233
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,730
But I can tell you

234
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:17,630
Every one of the passengers in this elevator

235
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,960
Was dead by the time they hit the ground.

236
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:27,500
I've worked on a project where I've seen this before.

237
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:30,130
The government had asked me if it was possible

238
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:34,960
To make a human being trackable by pigeons.

239
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,830
Like homing pigeons?

240
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:40,100
What possible use could that serve?

241
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,700
Well, I¡¯m sure it had something

242
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,400
To do with the commies.

243
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,700
It always did back then.

244
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,860
Regardless, our theory was that

245
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,100
Human beings are merely

246
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,960
Highly complex electrical systems.

247
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:52,960
Um...

248
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,900
Battery, please, Olivia.

249
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,560
The heart, the brain

250
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,760
Driven by electrical impulses.

251
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,560
and because everyone has

252
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,700
a unique electromagnetic signature,

253
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,530
like a fingerprint,

254
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,860
then we theorized that properly altered,

255
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:10,260
pigeons should be able to hone into that signature.

256
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:12,230
Like the way they know how to fly south for the winter.

257
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,860
Precisely.

258
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,200
But the human field was too weak,

259
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,600
So we tried to augment it

260
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,900
and make it strong enough for the birds to detect.

261
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,700
Did it work?

262
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,130
Oh, yes.

263
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,560
But the side effects negated our plans.

264
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,960
There was one test subject,

265
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,330
every time she hiccupped, the lights would dim.

266
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,800
So you're saying these people

267
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,900
could control electronic devices?

268
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,530
No, not deliberately.

269
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:38,900
But I did surmise that it should be possible.

270
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,930


271
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,800
Oh.

272
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,500
Did you just make that thing come back to life?

273
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,860
No, not in this particular instance.

274
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,830
But it does confirm my theory.

275
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,260
What theory?

276
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,330
Didn't I say?

277
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:53,660
No.

278
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:56,830
Well, someone has pursued this idea.

279
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,930
They have amplified

280
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:01,160
a person's electromagnetic field.

281
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,660
And in fact,

282
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:05,160
it is the residual energy from that person

283
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,200
that is making this heart pump.

284
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,860
And further,

285
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:11,030
it is that person

286
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,260
who is responsible for the deaths in the elevator.

287
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,260
So you don't think it was a weapon

288
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,460
that electrocuted those people?

289
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,460
No.

290
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,760
It was a human being.

291
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,500
Accident occurred just after 10:00 a.m.

292
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,330
here at the Herndon building in downtown Worcester.

293
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,730
Hey, Ron wanted to see you.

294
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,160
... haven't yet been released,

295
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,900
dropped 26 stories to their death

296
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,300
when the building's elevator system

297
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,730
failed catastrophically.

298
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,200
what's wrong with you?

299
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,330
Investigators are now looking into possible answers

300
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,560
as to why the emergency brakes...

301
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,060
You look sick.

302
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,730
Thank you, Daniel.

303
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,860
Excuse me, Mr. Boynton.

304
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,360
Where have you been?

305
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,430
Excuse me?

306
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,230
Do you remember last week what I said to you?

307
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,830
The words I used?

308
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:07,960
How sympathetic I was?

309
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,160
What did I... what did I say?

310
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,230
That... that you...

311
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,700
Yeah, that you were watching my performance.

312
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,860
I said you had to stay on the damn grid

313
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:13,900
and stick to the schedule.

314
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,330
because the system here,

315
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:17,130
even when things are working, depends on people like you

316
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:18,830
being, at the very least, reliable.

317
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:21,000
I've... I've...

318
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,360
had a really hard day.

319
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,100
Guess what?

320
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,830
Your day is fantastic compared to mine.

321
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,400
No, it's not.

322
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,200
What the hell's on your uniform?

323
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,760
- What?  - What is that?

324
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,260
I don't... I don't know.

325
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,430
And I'm... I'm not sure.

326
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:35,760
I'll tell you what.

327
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,330
I'll make it easy.

328
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,830
It's not your uniform anymore.

329
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:40,600
- Get your ass down to the locker room...  - wait.

330
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,760
Take it off and leave it there.

331
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,830
No, but... but please.

332
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:45,160
I take care of my mother.

333
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,730
Yeah, and I take care of my family.

334
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,260
And one of the ways I do that

335
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,700
is to employ smart, reliable, capable people.

336
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,800
and you are none of those things.

337
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,900
Please.

338
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,160
You're fired. Go.

339
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,660
Mr. Boyn...

340
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,960
Get outta here, Meager.

341
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,430
I don't want to see you in this building anymore.

342
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,660
Get the hell outta here!

343
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:10,760


344
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,700


345
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,300
Aah!

346
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:42,230
Here.

347
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,830
Thanks.

348
00:16:48,830 --> 00:16:50,760
I thought you left hours ago.

349
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,360
I could say the same about you.

350
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,030
what are you reading?

351
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,200
"Neural distortion in human subjects."

352
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,960
And what's all this for?

353
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,630
I'm just trying to wrap my head

354
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,400
around an idea Walter had.

355
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,760
He believes that it may be a person

356
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,000
who was responsible for the Herndon incident.

357
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,300
Not a person wielding some kind of device.

358
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,400
A person who has somehow developed the ability

359
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,200
to affect, or maybe even control, electrical devices.

360
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,730
and I suppose the good doctor

361
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,200
has a theory how that's possible.

362
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,200
He thinks this person was altered in some way.

363
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,000
Extensive procedures.

364
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,100
Chemical therapy.

365
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,160
What?

366
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,030
In the course of investigating

367
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,300
other pattern cases,

368
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
we've come across a handful of clinics.

369
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:45,100
off the grid operations that solicited clients

370
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,800
by making the same kinds of claims

371
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,830
you see advertised on TV at 3:00 a.m.

372
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,700
Only they weren't actually providing weight loss

373
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,900
or hair growth.

374
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,230
What were they really doing?

375
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:59,800
Have you ever heard of a man named Jacob Fischer?

376
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,730
No.

377
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,030
Doctor of biotechnology.

378
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:06,700
Wanted in four states and three countries

379
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,430
for illegal human experimentation.

380
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,830
Surgical alterations,

381
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,500
radical hormone therapy.

382
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,130
using average citizens as unwitting guinea pigs.

383
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,830
One subject was pumped full of stimulants

384
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,100
and kept awake for a solid year.

385
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:22,060
Fed on a steady visual diet of horrific images.

386
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,400
I only bring it up

387
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,530
because if Dr. Bishop is right,

388
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,630
and there is a person

389
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:30,360
with these extraordinary capabilities,

390
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,100
it might very well be that someone made him this way.

391
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:36,760
I'd like to read the files on Dr. Fischer.

392
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,530
I'll have them transferred to your terminal.

393
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,160
but it's not easy stuff to look at.

394
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,000


395
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,600
Hello?

396
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,860


397
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,030
Hey, Liv.

398
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,300
It's okay. It's okay.

399
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,660
It's just me.

400
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,830
I know this doesn't make any sense to you.

401
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,060
Even if it did,

402
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,630
I know you don't have any reason to trust me.

403
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,100
But that's what I'm asking you to do.

404
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,800
We don't have much time.

405
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,830
I'm here to help.

406
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,100
You tried to kill me.

407
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:02,260
No, Liv.

408
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,400
I loved you.

409
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,900


410
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,860
You know that.

411
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,430
You know I loved you.

412
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:12,900
I did. Always.

413
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:18,100
I can prove it to you.

414
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,430
But not here.

415
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,430
It's... it's just not the way it works.

416
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:27,330
You're on the right track.

417
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:29,460
I'm here to tell you that.

418
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,700
You're looking for a person,

419
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,700
But Jacob Fischer is after him also.

420
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,160
you need to get to him first,

421
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,360
before Fischer can use him.

422
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,360
Use him for what?

423
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,400


424
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,730
Use him for what?

425
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,230
How do you know that?

426
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,800
I will prove it, Liv.

427
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,000
That I love you. Always.

428
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,860
But not just yet.

429
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,430
You're just gonna have to wait.

430
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,660
There were weight sensors in the elevator.

431
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:51,230
So just before impact,

432
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:53,560
the car weighed 1,440 pounds.

433
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,730
the combined weight of the victims,

434
00:22:56,730 --> 00:22:58,560
1,275 pounds.

435
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,260
leaving a discrepancy of 165 pounds.

436
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:04,130
Meaning someone walked out of there alive.

437
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:07,030
Okay.

438
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,530
Somebody got lucky. So what?

439
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:11,630
Walter's theoretical test subject.

440
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:13,660
I think he's real

441
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,430
and that this might be him.

442
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:16,430
The only problem with that scenario

443
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:18,660
is that it doesn't make sense.

444
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,060
if he was in the elevator car,

445
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,130
he should've been electrocuted

446
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:22,630
just like everybody else.

447
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,860
And that's if the impact didn't kill him first.

448
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,460
Not necessarily.

449
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:29,630
If this person is both the source and the conductor

450
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,460
of a large amount of electrical current,

451
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,430
then it could well induce a form

452
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:35,430
of electrodynamic levitation.

453
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,900
That's the technology behind maglev trains.

454
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,400
They essentially float on an electromagnetic cushion.

455
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,160
So he floated.

456
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,930
Like my necklace in the elevator?

457
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:50,160
Um, no, but...

458
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,060
it is possible that he could've levitated

459
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,930
long enough to escape the brunt of the impact.

460
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:57,600
That still doesn't make sense.

461
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,900
If you can sabotage machines,

462
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,860
you wouldn't sabotage one you're in.

463
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,500


464
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,000
Unless it was unintentional.

465
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,400
An accident.

466
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,330
Maybe whoever we're looking for

467
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:10,900
isn't in control of their abilities.

468
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,130
Maybe they don't even know what they're doing.

469
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,400
Then we shouldn't be looking for big events.

470
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,830
We should be looking for small ones.

471
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,500
Unintentional ones.

472
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,300
Oh, come on!

473
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,300
Damn it!

474
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
Just a small discharge.

475
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,130
Negligible compared to the voltage

476
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,660
coursing through that elevator.

477
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,760
I say we need to find this person and soon.

478
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,900
Before he finds out exactly what he's capable of.

479
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,700
Wool socks.

480
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,330
Charlie, thanks for waking up the team.

481
00:24:42,330 --> 00:24:44,130
Sure, look, we got reports of anomalies

482
00:24:44,130 --> 00:24:45,230
clustered around the outlying parts

483
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:46,900
of Worcester and the Terndon building.

484
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,230
Parking garage, gates,

485
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,330
automatic doors, a few cctvs.

486
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,400
Well, we need more.

487
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,700
Enough to discern a pattern.

488
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,560
You know, saying somebody's doing all this.

489
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,330
You do know that's crazy, right?

490
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,130
If it weren't, we wouldn't be looking for him.

491
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,800
- Mmm, Joseph.  - Mom.

492
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,060
What time is it?

493
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,760
Where the hell have you been?

494
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,300
Mom.

495
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,700
I think I made a big mistake.

496
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,960
You? Surprise.

497
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,000
No, pl...

498
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,100
please just listen to me.

499
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,200
Please.

500
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,260
A few months ago,

501
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,330
I was reading this magazine,

502
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,900
and there was this ad in the back

503
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,500
about tapping into your hidden potential, you know?

504
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,460
And I... I figured it couldn't hurt.

505
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,030
So I went down to this office.

506
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,360
They did some tests.

507
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,760
- Did you give them money?  - No, just listen...

508
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,400
What the hell's the matter with you?

509
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,860
They put me under some hypnosis.

510
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,000
I don't know.

511
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,430
And they... they said They were gonna, uh, realign

512
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,330
the electrical impulses of my brain.

513
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,400
Make it mimic a more confident person.

514
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,560
Oh...

515
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:46,600
No, but they did something to me!

516
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,730
They changed me.

517
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,230
I can't remember.

518
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,400
And now all these things have been happening.

519
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,800
I don't know what to do.

520
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't know what to do. What do I...

521
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,760
- I'm dying...  - Stop it!

522
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,200
Get a hold of your...

523
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,900
Damn it, mom!

524
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,500
For once, please!

525
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,260
Please help me.

526
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,430
Pills.

527
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,430
Oh, my god, Oh, my god.

528
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,530
No, no, no, please.

529
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:10,900


530
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,460
Pills.

531
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,460


532
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,600
Hello? Hello?

533
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,730


534
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,060
Hello?

535
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,530


536
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,630
Joseph Meegar.

537
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
You don't have to be scared, Joseph.

538
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,260
We want to help you.

539
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,530
We're here to adjust Your medication.

540
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,560
You did this to me.

541
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,700
What did you...

542
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,660
Ah!

543
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:00,330
Looking for anything unusual.

544
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,330
Systems going offline,

545
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:02,400
Random power surges.

546
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,800
Hey, I've got another incident.

547
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,430
Hold on.

548
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,630
Bicoastal parcel.

549
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:08,030
Guy lost his hand in a conveyor malfunction.

550
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,200
Bicoastal parcel?

551
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,930
Yeah.

552
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,100
I gotta call you back.

553
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,160
What?

554
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,100
Herndon building Security sign in sheet.

555
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:23,900
Bicoastal parcel.

556
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,460
Joseph Meegar.

557
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:56,060
she was found dead.

558
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,160
A pacemaker malfunction.

559
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,530
Olivia thinks they may have found our guy.

560
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:02,830
Yeah, now we just have to find him.

561
00:28:02,830 --> 00:28:04,760
Time of death was around 1:15 a.m.,

562
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,330
So god knows where he could be by now.

563
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:11,100
Ask her what's visible in the event perimeter.

564
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,800
Electronic, specifically.

565
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:13,830
Walter wants to know what's in the apartment.

566
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:15,200
What kind of gadgets.

567
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,560
uh, specifically electronics.

568
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:21,500
Um, okay, there's an answering machine.

569
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,830
An answering machine.

570
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,100
- Telephone.  - Telephone.

571
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,160
- Boom box.  - Boom box. 

572
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,260
- Fan.  - Fan. 

573
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,360
B...boom box.

574
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,560
That's a device for playing music.

575
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:30,300
Cassette tapes, yes?

576
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,530
Yes, but now's not really the time.

577
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,630
Anything else, Olivia?

578
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,830
Television.

579
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:35,930
A television.

580
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:36,960
Lamps.

581
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,130
A lamp.

582
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,130
Walter, Walter.

583
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,230
Pay attention, would you?

584
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,760
We're doing this for you.

585
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,560
Tell Olivia to come home.

586
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,760
I know how to find him.

587
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,360
So...

588
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,500
So what is this?

589
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,130
This is the sort of work I was born for.

590
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:00,460
You were hoping for something more specific, maybe?

591
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,060
Everyone has a unique magnetic fingerprint.

592
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,400
I said that, yes?

593
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,460
But it is limited.

594
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,500
Barely traceable,

595
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,000
Except in people like Mr....

596
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,060
What's his name?

597
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,400
Meegar.

598
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,600
Meegar.

599
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:18,300
But since Mr. Meegar has been enhanced,

600
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,060
He'll give off a stronger signal than your average joe.

601
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,730
So what's that got to do with the cassette tape?

602
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:25,430
The cassette tape is as simple as it gets.

603
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:27,400
Once exposed to a magnetic field,

604
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,360
It remains permanently magnetized.

605
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,200
Given the strength of Mister...

606
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:36,230
Meegar's electromagnetic signature,

607
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:38,600
Plus his proximity to the tape,

608
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,700
I have little doubt

609
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,200
That that cassette has been imprinted

610
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,960
With Meegar's electrical signature.

611
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,730
It... it's kind of like when a film camera

612
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,860
Double-exposes a picture.

613
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,200
Gotcha.

614
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,600
Now we just take out the music

615
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,300
And see what we have left.

616
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,460
Uh-huh.

617
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,460
Well...

618
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,930
Wait, wait, wait... there it is.

619
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,700


620
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,760
That's him.

621
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,560
That's Mister...

622
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,460
Meegar.

623
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,200
Yes.

624
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,430
Now to find Meegar.

625
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,460
How?

626
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,600
Birds.

627
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,430
Wait, you mean that pigeon thing?

628
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:18,760
Mm-hmm.

629
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,730
You believe we can find him using pigeons?

630
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:22,730
It's possible.

631
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,630
As I've said,

632
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,400
I can program carrier pigeons

633
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,630
to track a strong electromagnetic field.

634
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,430
We have his signature.

635
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:33,260
Now all we need are birds.

636
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,130
I... I wish you told me earlier,

637
00:30:35,130 --> 00:30:37,430
Because then I could've been working on it.

638
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,800
So how many?

639
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,160
Not many. Two dozen.

640
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,030
Two dozen.

641
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,360
Great.

642
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,060


643
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,360
Wait...where am I?

644
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,530
Tell Fischer he woke up.

645
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,160
What is... what is this place?

646
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,130
Hey, what are you doing?

647
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:13,300
What are you...

648
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,530
No, no, no!

649
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:15,900
No, wait, no... Please!

650
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,960
Please, please, please!

651
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,100


652
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,000
You ready?

653
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,060
Yes, ideal.

654
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:25,230
Walter, you're not gonna accidentally fry

655
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,130
One of those pigeons?

656
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:28,130
Stranger things have happened.

657
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,260
That's his motto.

658
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,560
As I said,

659
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,800
Pigeons contain traces of magnetite in their beaks.

660
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,830
Like hundreds of tiny

661
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,400
Compass needles.

662
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,230
The tesla coils will create

663
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:43,800
An artificial electromagnetic field,

664
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,430
Which I have already matched

665
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,800
With Mister...

666
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,330
Uh, whatever's unique signature,

667
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,930
And will now imprint onto the pigeon.

668
00:31:51,930 --> 00:31:55,500
So we set all of these birds free and they...

669
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,160
Fly to Joseph Meegar.

670
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,330
Yeah, I know.

671
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,630
Me too. I'll believe it when I see it.

672
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,530
Step back.

673
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:05,360
Work to be done.

674
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:10,800


675
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,630
GPS chip's ready?

676
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:18,530
Yep.

677
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:20,630
So we're putting GPS chips on carrier pigeons

678
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,730
To find a man who can control electricity?

679
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:26,030
I have you to thank for that, don't I?

680
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,100
Yeah, that's me.

681
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,360


682
00:32:47,630 --> 00:32:49,630
No!

683
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,160
You listened.

684
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,930
You're not real.

685
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,830
The last time we spoke,

686
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,030
You listened.

687
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,100
You stay the hell away from me.

688
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:07,460
Liv.

689
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:30,130
I didn't betray you.

690
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:33,230
You know that. In your heart.

691
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:37,860
You know I wasn't the one.

692
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,030


693
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,100
Hey.

694
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,400
I think this bird thing

695
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,400
Might actually work.

696
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,330
You okay?

697
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,000
Yeah.

698
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,330
Hey, Charlie.

699
00:33:58,330 --> 00:34:01,660
Oh, thanks.

700
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,160
Did I miss anything?

701
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,760
I think the show's about to start.

702
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,060
I know we've only been together for a short time,

703
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:10,100
But I think I'm going to miss them.

704
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:12,000
Such majestic creatures.

705
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,830
They're rats with wings.

706
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:15,600
You'll get over it.

707
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,630


708
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,330
All right, GPS is active.

709
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,630
Excellent.

710
00:34:21,630 --> 00:34:23,930
Then we're ready.

711
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,530
Ladies and gentlemen,

712
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,560
Start your engines.

713
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,460


714
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,460
Start it up.

715
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,730
Come on, come on.

716
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,400


717
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:54,560


718
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,300
Are you sure this is gonna work?

719
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:01,060
Of course not.

720
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,960
Seriously, if this works...

721
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,160
You're gonna have some more faith

722
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,900
In your father?

723
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,700
No.

724
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,500
So what do we do now?

725
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,260
We gotta tie the GPS to the mainframe.

726
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,200
Genius.

727
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,930
And we're in.

728
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,060
And there are the birds.

729
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,830
I don't see them.

730
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,930
Yeah, we lost the birds.

731
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,160
They're going northwest

732
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,800
Towards Mill street.

733
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,830
We're approaching Mill now.

734
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:44,830
Uh, make a left.

735
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,160
Take a left.

736
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,930


737
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,660
I see them.

738
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:53,800
All right, we got them.

739
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,860
I see them.

740
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,830
Glad you got the car washed?

741
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,530
Ah! Ah!

742
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,960
What is that?

743
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,260
It is unfair.

744
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,960
And I appreciate that.

745
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,460
The position you find yourself in now

746
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,800
Must be so surreal for you.

747
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,200
Oh, my God! What did you do to me?

748
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,460
My head...hurts so much.

749
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,800
Those had to be subdermal.

750
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,400
They can be removed later.

751
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,600
What am I doing here?

752
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,260
No, no, no... Ah!

753
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,730
You don't realize

754
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,900
What you are.

755
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,460
I'm scared.

756
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,200
Okay?

757
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,330
You wanted to be confident.

758
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,360
That's why you came to us.

759
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,330
No, I don't want to be confident.

760
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,060
I don't need to be confident.

761
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,600
But you are now.

762
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,360
I just want my life back!

763
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,200
I just want to go back to how it was, please!

764
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,730
Look what science has made you, Joseph.

765
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:51,930
You are special.

766
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,500
No.

767
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,400
Make a right on Tempest.

768
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,300
Take your next right.

769
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,200


770
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,560
All right, I think they've stopped.

771
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,130
There.

772
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:12,360
All right, I got them. I see them.

773
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,130
Okay, we're heading there now.

774
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,060
Then our work is done.

775
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,200
Good luck.

776
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,600
Hey, you stay here.

777
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,330
Whatever you say, boss.

778
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:39,660
I'm not gonna ask.

779
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:41,100
Good.

780
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,000
What is it?

781
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,960
Visitors. Front entrance.

782
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,800
Take him out through the back.

783
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,860
Wait at the depot.

784
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,860
You'll be contacted there.

785
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,860
What about you?

786
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,260
He's the priority.

787
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:05,830
No movement.

788
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:08,830
Stand back.

789
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,500
Where are you taking me?

790
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,100
Get in.

791
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,060
Get in the car!

792
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,460
Get those hands up.

793
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:51,760
I said get your hands in the air.

794
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,160
Joseph Meegar.

795
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:57,230
Where is he?

796
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,930
I'm sorry. Who?

797
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,400
Take upstairs.

798
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,660
We'll go around.

799
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,400
Freeze!

800
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,330
Stop!

801
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:23,460
Joseph!

802
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:27,030


803
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:37,030


804
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,130
Stop or I will shoot!

805
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,230
Ugh!

806
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,860
They're gonna keep him heavily sedated for a while.

807
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,560
Don't want him pulling his whole electro-man thing.

808
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,660
Mr Meegar.

809
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:25,660
Miss, no one will tell me Where I'm going.

810
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:28,260
To the hospital.

811
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,930
They're going to perform some exams.

812
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:32,130
Check to see that your head's okay.

813
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,760
And then I'm gonna have some questions for you.

814
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,030
I want to go home.

815
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,960
I didn't want to hurt anybody.

816
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,000
We're going to help you.

817
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,160
That's what they said.

818
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,300
Please... I want to go home.

819
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,830
I'm afraid we can't let you do that.

820
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,200
That one can go out the back.

821
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,230
Thank you, my dear.

822
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,930
What's my name?

823
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,300
Starts with "a. "

824
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,300
yes?

825
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,300
Astrid.

826
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,730


827
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,960
I knew it.

828
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:19,300
Ah, Olivia.

829
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:23,260
Peter told me to tell you, If I saw you,

830
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,060
That he was returning the pigeons.

831
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,130
Walter.

832
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,600
What's...

833
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,660
It's milk.

834
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,660
From gene.

835
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,660
Do you want some?

836
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,660
I' ll pass.

837
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,530
- Are you certain?  - Mm hmm.

838
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:36,000
Hmm.

839
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,460
The color in your face.

840
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:40,000
You're looking a little pallid.

841
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,130
Are you feeling well?

842
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,630
Fine.

843
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:46,160
I'm a little tired. That's all.

844
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,200
Well, I don't yet know you

845
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,400
Well enough to ask this,

846
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,660
But, uh...

847
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,030
You haven't seemed yourself lately.

848
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,430
I haven't been sleeping very well.

849
00:42:05,230 --> 00:42:07,230
I've been...

850
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,660
Nothing.

851
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,300
See you tomorrow.

852
00:42:18,830 --> 00:42:20,700
You've been seeing him.

853
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,730
Your friend.

854
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:23,700
John Scott.

855
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm not surprised.

856
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,230
There is a reason.

857
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:35,760
I've been having hallucinations.

858
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,400
No.

859
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,660
Not hallucinations.

860
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,200
Walter.

861
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:53,560
What's happening?

862
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,730
I can't be sure.

863
00:42:55,730 --> 00:42:58,100
The brain is a mystery.

864
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,030
But I believe

865
00:43:01,030 --> 00:43:04,430
When you were in the tank,

866
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:07,560
John Scott...

867
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:11,160
that part of his consciousness

868
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,460
crossed over into yours.

869
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,560
And it's still there.

870
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,930
His memories.

871
00:43:17,930 --> 00:43:21,660
Experiences, thoughts.

872
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,160
You understand me, yes?

873
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,600
These aren't memories.

874
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,660
He appears right in front of me.

875
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:33,760
He talks to me.

876
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:36,860
Yes, he would.

877
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:39,700
Like a waking dream.

878
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,230
Because he doesn't belong there.

879
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,860
There's only room for one voice in your head,

880
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,460
Not two.

881
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,200
This is your brain's way

882
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,700
of working it out.

883
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,830
Your mind is expelling him.

884
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:56,000
His thoughts.

885
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,060
He'll go away.

886
00:43:58,060 --> 00:43:59,700
Is that what you're saying?

887
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:05,860
I don't know.

888
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,000
Do you really want him to?

889
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:34,860


890
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:06,800


891
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,960


892
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,160
John?

893
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,860
Our team's still cataloging

894
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:49,530
All the files that we found in the cellar.

895
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:51,030
Apparently John Scott was conducting

896
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:52,800
his own investigations.

897
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,130
Did the files give any indication

898
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:55,860
of who he might've been working for?

899
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:57,960
Not that we can see.

900
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,700
But it appears that many of the cases

901
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:00,830
Were pattern-related.

902
00:46:00,830 --> 00:46:02,500
He knew about the pattern.

903
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,400
He also knew about our friend Dr. Fischer.

904
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,000
In fact, he knew quite a bit more than we did.

905
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,230
Including seven other potential Josephs

906
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,930
yhat fischer was subjecting to treatments.

907
00:46:12,930 --> 00:46:16,060
fortunately, none of them had activated yet.

908
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:18,230
We were able to locate all seven.

909
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:22,000
Medical services is examining them now.

910
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,660
But they appear to be fine, thanks to you.

911
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,560
Fischer's still refusing to cooperate,

912
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,930
But I suspect six weeks in solitary

913
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,660
might change his mind.

914
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:31,200
Well, I hope you're right about that.

915
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,730
And there was also something else.

916
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:41,100
John Scott's personal effects.

917
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:43,930
It would seem some of them were intended for you.

918
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:39,160
I will prove it, Liv, That I love you.

919
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,730
Always.
