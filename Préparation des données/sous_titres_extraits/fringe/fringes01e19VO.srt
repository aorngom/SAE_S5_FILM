1
00:00:06,364 --> 00:00:07,955
<i>For those of you
just joining us...</i>

2
00:00:08,794 --> 00:00:11,088
What you're looking at
is the work of Z.F.T.,

3
00:00:11,164 --> 00:00:13,006
a terrorist organization
responsible

4
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,924
for at least a half a dozen
biological attacks

5
00:00:14,959 --> 00:00:16,150
over the
last several months.

6
00:00:16,165 --> 00:00:18,305
<i>Everything we know thus far
can be found in your packets,</i>

7
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:20,144
including a copy
of their manifesto,

8
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,323
<i>which elucidates their idealogy
and their methods:</i>

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,322
"Destruction by the
advancement of technology,"

10
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,215
which in short boils down
to the following:

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,394
Attempting to provoke
or prepare for a war.

12
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:29,936
<i>War?</i>

13
00:00:30,111 --> 00:00:30,921
With whom?

14
00:00:31,256 --> 00:00:32,508
That's the question,
isn't it?

15
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:35,010
<i>What we do know
is that these bizarre acts</i>

16
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,815
<i>seem to be increasing
in frequency.</i>

17
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,789
<i>And that their targets
are unpredictable,</i>

18
00:00:38,855 --> 00:00:40,686
<i>and therefore,
unprotectable.</i>

19
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:42,356
Taxi.
Taxi!

20
00:00:47,992 --> 00:00:49,445
<i>We've recently
developed evidence</i>

21
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:52,049
which suggests Z.F.T.
is funded by an unlikely source

22
00:00:52,084 --> 00:00:53,660
and a name
I'm sure you've all heard of.

23
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:54,949
William Bell,

24
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:56,627
founder and chairman
of Massive Dynamic.

25
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,044
<i>Wait. Wait.
Hold the bus!</i>

26
00:01:03,422 --> 00:01:05,502
You go Up Park, right?
Past Lenox Hill Hospital?

27
00:01:05,537 --> 00:01:06,655
Yeah,
six stops away.

28
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:07,898
Are you feeling okay?

29
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:09,448
Fine.
Let's just go, please.

30
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:11,906
<i>Those of you
assembled in this room</i>

31
00:01:11,941 --> 00:01:13,804
now have
a single, clear-cut goal

32
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:16,659
<i>To provide actionable evidence
establishing a link</i>

33
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:18,516
<i>between
William Bell and Z.F.T.</i>

34
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:20,692
<i>Special Agents Olivia Dunham
and Charlie Francis</i>

35
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:22,113
will be assigning you
to teams

36
00:01:21,948 --> 00:01:23,422
and coordinating
the investigation.

37
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,710
All efforts and information
go through them.

38
00:01:26,142 --> 00:01:27,083
Now let's go to work.

39
00:01:58,551 --> 00:01:59,498
Stop the bus.

40
00:01:59,533 --> 00:02:01,336
Stop the bus, please.
I have to get off.

41
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:02,721
Ma'am, will you
please sit down?

42
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:03,764
- I'm not allowed to--
- Please stop the bus,

43
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:05,588
- I have to get off now.
- Okay, okay.

44
00:02:07,312 --> 00:02:08,193
Open the door!

45
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:13,240
Oh, my God!

46
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:15,334
Please, please help.
Somebody.

47
00:02:17,331 --> 00:02:19,719
Oh, my God.
I can't breathe.

48
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:21,231
Oh, my God.

49
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:25,983
Lady,
you okay?

50
00:02:28,018 --> 00:02:29,209
<i>Yeah, it's 911?</i>

51
00:02:45,912 --> 00:02:49,260
S01E19:
The Road Not Taken

52
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:08,289
Find anything new
and exciting in there, Walter?

53
00:03:08,363 --> 00:03:09,021
Huh?

54
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:10,880
Well, you've read
the manifesto

55
00:03:10,963 --> 00:03:12,310
about a dozen times
cover-to-cover...

56
00:03:12,363 --> 00:03:13,491
So just wondering.

57
00:03:15,263 --> 00:03:16,837
I need to
show you something, Peter.

58
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:27,304
Hey.

59
00:03:27,323 --> 00:03:28,056
Hey.

60
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,932
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

61
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:32,374
Show-and-tell,
apparently.

62
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:37,536
Walter...

63
00:03:37,603 --> 00:03:39,240
What is this?
I don't know what I'm looking at.

64
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:48,302
<i>This typewriter's
Belly's.</i>

65
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,929
I remember
the day he purchased it.

66
00:03:52,163 --> 00:03:52,925
It was raining.

67
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:54,868
Do you understand
what you're saying, Walter?

68
00:03:55,163 --> 00:03:57,131
That William Bell
doesn't just fund Z.F.T.,

69
00:03:57,163 --> 00:03:58,497
he wrote their manifesto,

70
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,873
and is actually responsible
for everything

71
00:03:59,903 --> 00:04:00,712
that's been happening?

72
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:02,102
Absolutely not.

73
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,274
William Bell
was many things.

74
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,929
He was ambitious.
He was egotistical.

75
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,946
He was temperamental.
But he wasn't a madman.

76
00:04:11,133 --> 00:04:13,587
<i>Although the ideas
in his manifesto are radical,</i>

77
00:04:13,663 --> 00:04:17,462
He wouldn't do this--
This--These horrendous things.

78
00:04:18,763 --> 00:04:19,805
He would never do it.

79
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,696
There are references
all throughout

80
00:04:23,037 --> 00:04:24,703
to the
chapter of ethics.

81
00:04:24,738 --> 00:04:26,447
But there is
no such chapter.

82
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:27,363
<i>It is missing.</i>

83
00:04:27,398 --> 00:04:30,048
<i>And I believe that
someone has removed it</i>

84
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:32,241
to suite
their own evil purposes.

85
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,266
- And I can prove it.
- How?

86
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:35,744
<i>Get another copy
of the book.</i>

87
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:36,930
One with
all the pages.

88
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,112
Walter,
there is no other copy.

89
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:39,161
This is the only one.

90
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,242
I'll get it.

91
00:04:40,663 --> 00:04:42,750
He wrote it here in,
in this lab.

92
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,006
The-It could still be here
somewhere,

93
00:04:45,019 --> 00:04:45,917
the original.

94
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,752
- And what if you're wrong?
- I'm not wrong.

95
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:50,641
And when I find it,
you will see.

96
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,488
It will absolve him,
Peter.

97
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,687
Peter, it's Olivia.

98
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:02,063
<i>So this is what
I've got so far.</i>

99
00:05:02,104 --> 00:05:03,734
<i>Bus driver called 911,</i>

100
00:05:03,991 --> 00:05:06,516
<i>reported an agitated woman
got off his bus.</i>

101
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:08,395
<i>Moments later,
she caught fire</i>

102
00:05:08,432 --> 00:05:09,404
and exploded.

103
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:10,742
Police combed the area.

104
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:12,579
They couldn't find any evidence
of an accelerant

105
00:05:12,624 --> 00:05:14,031
or an incendiary device.

106
00:05:14,803 --> 00:05:16,855
If there's something strange
in your neighborhood...

107
00:05:17,372 --> 00:05:18,465
Who you gotta call?

108
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:20,837
So what do you
make of this, Walter?

109
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:23,303
<i>Well, from what
Agent Francis described,</i>

110
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:25,608
it's possible
we're dealing with a case

111
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:28,266
of spontaneous
human combustion.

112
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:29,787
Thought that was
just a myth.

113
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,344
Oh, myth is just
an unverified fact.

114
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:34,154
Maybe she was hit
by a tiny meteor.

115
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:35,608
<i>It's also possible.</i>

116
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,540
Until I get this body
back to the lab,

117
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,809
I won't be able
to say anything

118
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,030
<i>with absolute certainty.</i>

119
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,245
All right,
I'll get the coroner

120
00:05:41,286 --> 00:05:42,951
<i>to prep the bodies
for transport.</i>

121
00:05:42,986 --> 00:05:43,597
<i>Bodies?</i>

122
00:05:43,603 --> 00:05:45,267
Is there another
somewhere?

123
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:51,434
<i>You okay?</i>

124
00:05:52,836 --> 00:05:53,854
<i>Yeah, I just...</i>

125
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,068
Broyles.

126
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:18,617
Send her in.

127
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,307
- Phillip.
- Nina.

128
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:27,085
I won't play coy,
Phillip.

129
00:06:27,703 --> 00:06:29,956
I understand the FBI
has opened an investigation

130
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:31,143
into
Massive Dynamic.

131
00:06:31,403 --> 00:06:34,531
As you can imagine,
we spend a lot of money

132
00:06:34,578 --> 00:06:36,192
on counter-intelligence.

133
00:06:36,263 --> 00:06:37,974
And any probe
into our finances

134
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:39,156
raises red flags.

135
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:43,831
So...

136
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:45,946
What are you
fishing for?

137
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:48,948
Industrial espionage?
Treaty violations?

138
00:06:49,363 --> 00:06:50,670
We have evidence
that indicates

139
00:06:50,705 --> 00:06:53,511
William Bell may be involved
with several biological attacks,

140
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,971
perpetrated
this past year.

141
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:58,261
- But that's ridiculous.
- <i>Perhaps.</i>

142
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:01,300
But as long as
you're here...

143
00:07:02,163 --> 00:07:04,818
If you have something to offer,
now would be the time.

144
00:07:04,853 --> 00:07:06,561
I'm not one of
your street thugs

145
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:07,873
that you can bully,
Phillip.

146
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:10,730
And William Bell
is not a terrorist.

147
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:12,997
I'd like to hear him
tell me that himself.

148
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:15,026
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

149
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:16,117
He's traveling.

150
00:07:21,263 --> 00:07:22,365
You're wasting
your time.

151
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:24,778
William Bell
is not the enemy.

152
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,080
Is there something else?

153
00:07:38,449 --> 00:07:41,430
Matter is just energy
waiting to happen.

154
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:46,617
The average adult at rest
contains enough potential energy

155
00:07:46,652 --> 00:07:48,477
to explode
with the force of

156
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:50,628
five very large
hydrogen bombs.

157
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:51,938
You know, theoretically,
you're actually right?

158
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:56,063
Ho ho ho ho!
My son finally agrees with me!

159
00:07:56,098 --> 00:07:57,996
Uh, Agent Farnsworth,
take a note of that.

160
00:07:58,031 --> 00:07:59,094
Unfortunately,
we're just not very good

161
00:07:59,129 --> 00:07:59,938
at releasing it.

162
00:08:00,003 --> 00:08:01,081
<i>No.
It needs a spark,</i>

163
00:08:01,117 --> 00:08:02,149
of course.
A trigger.

164
00:08:02,184 --> 00:08:04,217
So what do you think
would've released it in her?

165
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:06,229
Some say
a particle is to blame--

166
00:08:06,264 --> 00:08:08,982
The appropriately named
"Pyroton."

167
00:08:09,017 --> 00:08:12,109
<i>Maybe we could finally prove
that it exists.</i>

168
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:14,708
Peter!
Fire up the electron microscope!

169
00:08:14,903 --> 00:08:15,496
<i>Uh...</i>

170
00:08:15,637 --> 00:08:17,461
About that,
I might've taken that apart.

171
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,731
- What on Earth for?
- I needed the parts.

172
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,894
For a project
I'm working on.

173
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:24,768
As I said...

174
00:08:25,124 --> 00:08:27,070
Potential for destruction
in each of us

175
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:28,042
is infinite!

176
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,334
Yes, Jim,
I understand.

177
00:08:42,286 --> 00:08:42,947
<i>Right away.</i>

178
00:08:43,603 --> 00:08:45,457
I had you pegged
as a creature of habit.

179
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,036
You changed
your office.

180
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:51,730
Come again.

181
00:08:52,438 --> 00:08:53,772
Your desk.
You moved it.

182
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,701
Uh, we know
from the driver

183
00:09:00,736 --> 00:09:02,096
what stop
she got on.

184
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,935
He's worked up
an artist sketch rendering.

185
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,453
So we'll canvass
the area,

186
00:09:06,488 --> 00:09:07,721
see if we can ID her.

187
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,932
What about
the other victim?

188
00:09:09,563 --> 00:09:11,688
<i>Did the bus driver
see her get on too?</i>

189
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:13,239
Were they not together?

190
00:09:14,563 --> 00:09:16,352
I'm sorry.
You mean one.

191
00:09:16,919 --> 00:09:18,690
There was only
one victim.

192
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:19,941
I'm confused.

193
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:39,833
Agent Dunham?

194
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:47,783
Where are we
on this?

195
00:09:50,763 --> 00:09:53,494
Uh, the bus driver
remembered

196
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:54,943
what stop she,
uh...

197
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:58,368
What stop she got on.

198
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,449
He gave us
an artist sketch rendering.

199
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:06,073
We're gonna show it around and
see if we can ID her.

200
00:10:06,333 --> 00:10:07,930
<i>What the hell
is going on here?</i>

201
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:08,560
<i>Sanford.</i>

202
00:10:08,601 --> 00:10:10,091
Why is the
entire 13th floor

203
00:10:10,136 --> 00:10:12,789
trying to link William Bell
to biological terror attacks?

204
00:10:12,824 --> 00:10:14,618
We have evidence that
Bell might be implicated.

205
00:10:14,653 --> 00:10:15,298
Yeah,
I know what you have.

206
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:16,719
You have testimony
from a dead man

207
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:18,639
who himself
was an admitted terrorist.

208
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:21,305
<i>Well, his testimony confirms
what we've long suspected.</i>

209
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,675
Massive Dynamic
may be involved

210
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,784
or behind the events
we've been witnessing.

211
00:10:25,819 --> 00:10:27,962
William Bell
and Massive Dynamic

212
00:10:27,997 --> 00:10:30,930
are the Defense D epartment's
largest contractors.

213
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,720
These waters are much too deep
for a fishing expedition.

214
00:10:33,755 --> 00:10:35,734
Are you seriously suggesting
that we just ignore?

215
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:37,458
I am telling you
to drop this,

216
00:10:37,493 --> 00:10:39,072
considering that you have
nothing more

217
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:42,398
than an unsubstantiated report
from a hostile source.

218
00:10:42,571 --> 00:10:43,322
Clear?

219
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,145
- Are we really going to--
- No.

220
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,050
Get more evidence.

221
00:11:00,533 --> 00:11:02,542
Just a few more
centimeters.

222
00:11:04,184 --> 00:11:05,012
<i>You know,
Walter,</i>

223
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:06,285
working with you...

224
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:08,871
It's amazing the sort of things
you get used to.

225
00:11:08,954 --> 00:11:10,883
You're not the first person
to tell me that.

226
00:11:11,024 --> 00:11:11,730
Wow.

227
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:13,641
Looks like somebody
could've flossed more.

228
00:11:20,884 --> 00:11:21,711
Okay.

229
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,133
Let's just hope that she has
her dental records on file.

230
00:11:25,854 --> 00:11:27,339
File,
of course?

231
00:11:27,784 --> 00:11:29,073
<i>My filing system.</i>

232
00:11:29,224 --> 00:11:31,758
Perhaps that's where
I hid the manifesto!

233
00:11:31,854 --> 00:11:33,203
You mean like
how you seal things

234
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:34,453
in the walls
of your old house

235
00:11:34,484 --> 00:11:35,658
or how you
squirrel things away

236
00:11:35,724 --> 00:11:38,032
in random deposit boxes
around the country?

237
00:11:38,124 --> 00:11:39,690
I would hardly call that
a "filing system."

238
00:11:39,762 --> 00:11:41,801
I was prone to hide things
because I was afraid

239
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:42,831
that someone would...

240
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:45,054
<i>unlock
all my secrets.</i>

241
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:47,487
I didn't realize that
the someone would be me.

242
00:11:47,524 --> 00:11:49,422
Where's my Geiger counter?
I left it here.

243
00:11:49,784 --> 00:11:51,162
Wait, you think
a radiation detector's

244
00:11:51,207 --> 00:11:52,591
gonna help you
find the manifesto?

245
00:11:52,784 --> 00:11:53,573
No.

246
00:11:54,134 --> 00:11:56,831
But I find that
the rhythmic ticking...

247
00:11:56,884 --> 00:11:58,639
It emits
helps me think.

248
00:11:58,684 --> 00:12:01,893
Oh, Walter,
Peter actually cannibalized that

249
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:03,128
for his project too.

250
00:12:03,184 --> 00:12:04,065
Oh, no, look...

251
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:05,503
<i>This has
got to stop.</i>

252
00:12:05,749 --> 00:12:06,952
<i>Lab rule number one:</i>

253
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:10,484
<i>Do not borrow Walter's equipment
without asking!</i>

254
00:12:10,524 --> 00:12:13,735
Walter,
we found a match on the victim.

255
00:12:18,455 --> 00:12:19,878
<i>Her name is
Susan Pratt.</i>

256
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:29,084
Thank you.
We'll take it from here.

257
00:12:30,308 --> 00:12:34,716
Susan Pratt.
She's 29 years old. Single.

258
00:12:35,854 --> 00:12:37,885
Worked for a
New York Highway Department.

259
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:40,264
Tollbooth operator.

260
00:12:40,555 --> 00:12:42,298
That's a
lonely line of work.

261
00:12:47,047 --> 00:12:49,663
Doesn't look like she had much
of a social life either.

262
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:54,204
She's definitely
a table for one.

263
00:13:00,854 --> 00:13:01,744
<i>Hey, Liv.</i>

264
00:13:02,054 --> 00:13:03,794
You think there's something
wrong with her?

265
00:13:04,254 --> 00:13:05,315
What do you mean?

266
00:13:05,924 --> 00:13:09,095
<i>You know, good-looking woman
in the prime of her life.</i>

267
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:11,427
<i>No evidence
of a boyfriend.</i>

268
00:13:12,154 --> 00:13:13,812
Or any friends
for that matter.

269
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:16,574
Just doesn't exactly strike me
as being normal.

270
00:13:16,654 --> 00:13:17,788
<i>Well,
I guess that depends</i>

271
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:20,038
on what your definition
of normal is.

272
00:13:26,084 --> 00:13:26,703
<i>Liv.</i>

273
00:13:27,484 --> 00:13:29,318
Hey, Charlie,
I think I found something.

274
00:13:29,484 --> 00:13:32,963
She has a $30,000 check
from an Isaac Winters.

275
00:13:33,124 --> 00:13:34,352
<i>I found something
too.</i>

276
00:13:34,524 --> 00:13:35,924
I think you should take
a look at this.

277
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,281
What the hell
happened to her?

278
00:13:55,495 --> 00:13:56,655
<i>Walter, come back!</i>

279
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,530
Did you get it?

280
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:00,600
No, I told you
they don't have it.

281
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:03,684
Has to be franken berry,
that's what I ate back then.

282
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:06,483
If I'm to remember
where I hid the manuscript,

283
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,027
it's simple sense memory,
Peter.

284
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:09,702
But they don't have it.

285
00:14:09,747 --> 00:14:11,242
For all we know,
they don't even make it anymore.

286
00:14:11,568 --> 00:14:14,037
I did, however,
get you this.

287
00:14:14,254 --> 00:14:15,900
All the
artificial sugary sweetness

288
00:14:15,956 --> 00:14:17,317
a growing scientist
needs.

289
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:19,068
Hello,
Agent Dunham!

290
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:23,289
Let me guess,
you're a cornflakes gal.

291
00:14:23,424 --> 00:14:24,344
Am I correct?

292
00:14:24,603 --> 00:14:26,371
Uh, yeah.

293
00:14:26,484 --> 00:14:27,084
<i>Why not?</i>

294
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,648
<i>So we went to
the victim's apartment</i>

295
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:32,771
and there appears to be
evidence of other fires.

296
00:14:34,175 --> 00:14:36,019
So the bus stop
wasn't her first incident.

297
00:14:36,054 --> 00:14:36,586
No.

298
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:39,060
Walter.

299
00:14:39,724 --> 00:14:41,217
Does that mean
something to you?

300
00:14:42,084 --> 00:14:43,452
Well,
it changes everything.

301
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:47,023
We can rule out
spontaneous human combustion.

302
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,913
For one, I mean,
that's strictly a one-off event

303
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:50,821
as you can imagine.

304
00:14:51,546 --> 00:14:52,869
So what does it rule in?

305
00:14:55,105 --> 00:14:56,188
Pyrokinesis.

306
00:14:56,384 --> 00:14:56,888
Stop.

307
00:14:56,927 --> 00:14:58,359
There's no time for jokes,
Walter.

308
00:14:58,394 --> 00:14:59,324
Pyrokinesis?

309
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,739
<i>It's not even
a real word.</i>

310
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:02,049
<i>It was made up by
Stephen King.</i>

311
00:15:02,124 --> 00:15:03,715
You ever see Firestarter
with Drew Barrymore?

312
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:05,136
<i>Little girl who can start fires
with her mind?</i>

313
00:15:05,177 --> 00:15:07,100
Mr. King
coined the term,

314
00:15:07,151 --> 00:15:09,220
but the phenomenon
existed long before that.

315
00:15:09,897 --> 00:15:11,424
Well, it's not
that complicated, really.

316
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:13,039
It's merely
a form of telekinesis.

317
00:15:13,085 --> 00:15:15,186
The ability to move objects
with the mind.

318
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,181
- Merely?
- <i>However, with pyrokinetics,</i>

319
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:20,994
they can excite objects
at a molecular level.

320
00:15:22,017 --> 00:15:25,854
Well, well, look,
think, think of, of, of

321
00:15:25,854 --> 00:15:28,486
each of these grains of cereal
as a molecule.

322
00:15:29,077 --> 00:15:35,139
Uh, as the molecules
start to vibrate more quickly,

323
00:15:36,105 --> 00:15:37,672
they generate heat.

324
00:15:38,618 --> 00:15:39,640
Energy.

325
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,406
Until that energy
must be released!

326
00:15:44,554 --> 00:15:46,254
It's a fascinating demonstration,
Walter.

327
00:15:46,289 --> 00:15:47,830
But it still doesn't explain
why it is

328
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:49,176
that Susan Pratt blew up.

329
00:15:49,254 --> 00:15:51,195
<i>I suspect
this was a newfound ability.</i>

330
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,487
Well, it, it,
it takes training

331
00:15:52,563 --> 00:15:54,998
to generate a heat source
outside of the body.

332
00:15:55,239 --> 00:15:57,637
Without proper control,
the energy is turned inward.

333
00:15:58,032 --> 00:16:00,054
You see?
She had no other options.

334
00:16:00,054 --> 00:16:01,375
So you think that
she had a choice...

335
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:04,317
To either
blow somebody else up,

336
00:16:04,352 --> 00:16:06,005
- or blow herself up.
- Yes.

337
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,018
But this poor woman had yet
to master her ability.

338
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:10,477
Which made her
a powder keg.

339
00:16:11,154 --> 00:16:12,678
Emotional stress,
agitation,

340
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:15,554
any high anxiety
would set her off.

341
00:16:15,589 --> 00:16:17,236
So where does this ability
come from?

342
00:16:17,254 --> 00:16:19,624
Is it that
she was just born different

343
00:16:19,624 --> 00:16:21,692
or is it something
that someone did to her?

344
00:16:22,524 --> 00:16:25,943
That is the real question now,
isn't it?

345
00:16:26,584 --> 00:16:28,190
I'm not cleaning that up,
by the way.

346
00:16:29,455 --> 00:16:30,056
Dunham.

347
00:16:30,454 --> 00:16:31,951
<i>We got a hit
from that check you found</i>

348
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:33,407
<i>in Susan Pratt's
apartment.</i>

349
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,634
Uh,
it was cut from a law firm.

350
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:36,181
Signed by

351
00:16:36,221 --> 00:16:37,126
<i>Isaac Winters.</i>

352
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:39,598
<i>He has an office
in Charlestown.</i>

353
00:17:11,703 --> 00:17:12,814
No movement.

354
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:16,694
Why am I not surprised
you brought one of those?

355
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:18,706
Because you know me
too well.

356
00:17:18,724 --> 00:17:21,347
<i>If we get caught,
I don't know you at all.</i>

357
00:17:36,954 --> 00:17:38,629
Looks like
somebody left in a hurry.

358
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:41,107
<i>You have
four new messages.</i>

359
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:47,259
<i>Mr. Winters,
this is Susan.</i>

360
00:17:47,326 --> 00:17:48,131
<i>Susan Pratt.</i>

361
00:17:48,344 --> 00:17:49,299
<i>You told me
to call you</i>

362
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,271
<i>if anything odd
started happening.</i>

363
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:53,649
<i>Well, it did,
after I took the tests.</i>

364
00:17:54,005 --> 00:17:55,431
<i>Please call me back.</i>

365
00:17:57,754 --> 00:18:00,708
I'm gonna call ERT,
have them dust for prints.

366
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:04,290
<i>Mr. Winters,
it's Susan again.</i>

367
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:05,077
<i>You told me--</i>

368
00:18:05,135 --> 00:18:06,921
<i>You told me
not to talk to anybody,</i>

369
00:18:06,967 --> 00:18:07,914
<i>but I'm scared.</i>

370
00:18:08,584 --> 00:18:09,842
<i>What's happening
to me?</i>

371
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:27,092
<i>Attention,
all citizens.</i>

372
00:18:27,654 --> 00:18:29,463
<i>Evacuate the area now!</i>

373
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:32,625
<i>Proceed to the
nearest emergency shelter.</i>

374
00:18:33,054 --> 00:18:34,463
<i>This is not a test.</i>

375
00:18:35,093 --> 00:18:36,273
<i>Hey, Liv.</i>

376
00:18:42,524 --> 00:18:43,281
You okay?

377
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:49,397
<i>You sure
you haven't had any LSD?</i>

378
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:52,644
Masculine and
magic mushrooms.

379
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,263
It wasn't a drug trip,
Walter.

380
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:56,848
Well, visual hallucinations
can be caused

381
00:18:56,904 --> 00:18:57,652
by a number of things.

382
00:18:57,687 --> 00:18:59,166
Could you look straight ahead,
please?

383
00:18:59,713 --> 00:19:02,442
Sleep deprivation,
a concussion, brain tumor.

384
00:19:03,315 --> 00:19:05,285
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

385
00:19:06,195 --> 00:19:07,439
Oh, I don't think so.

386
00:19:08,015 --> 00:19:09,945
If you were actually
going insane,

387
00:19:09,972 --> 00:19:12,196
you'd likely have
no idea what's happening.

388
00:19:13,115 --> 00:19:14,322
Take it from me.

389
00:19:15,915 --> 00:19:18,739
When did these episodes start?
How did they feel?

390
00:19:18,745 --> 00:19:20,402
First with
Susan Pratt's body.

391
00:19:20,445 --> 00:19:21,806
Then it was in
Broyles' office.

392
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,221
The other
on the street.

393
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:27,526
The same people, the same places,
but bleak.

394
00:19:28,245 --> 00:19:30,363
The, uh,
the city was on fire.

395
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:32,723
Fascinating.

396
00:19:32,915 --> 00:19:34,443
There's another possibility,

397
00:19:34,575 --> 00:19:36,133
but it's a bit complicated.

398
00:19:37,645 --> 00:19:38,691
Déjà vu.

399
00:19:38,845 --> 00:19:39,964
It wasn't déjà vu,
Walter.

400
00:19:40,015 --> 00:19:40,857
Not even close.

401
00:19:41,251 --> 00:19:44,667
Typical protracted déjà vu.
Prolonged.

402
00:19:44,715 --> 00:19:46,300
What,
you're familiar with the--

403
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,552
The pliability
of space-time, yes?

404
00:19:48,575 --> 00:19:49,489
Of course,
who isn't.

405
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:52,054
One minute will explain.

406
00:19:57,515 --> 00:19:58,186
<i>Most of us...</i>

407
00:19:58,247 --> 00:20:01,600
experience life as
a-a linear progression

408
00:20:01,641 --> 00:20:03,616
just like this.

409
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:05,257
But this is an illusion

410
00:20:05,327 --> 00:20:07,642
because every day,
life presents us

411
00:20:07,688 --> 00:20:08,961
with an array of choices.

412
00:20:09,015 --> 00:20:10,947
<i>As a result,
life should look</i>

413
00:20:10,988 --> 00:20:13,062
more like this.

414
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:15,864
<i>And each choice...</i>

415
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:18,211
leads to a new path.

416
00:20:19,415 --> 00:20:23,865
To go to work.
To stay home.

417
00:20:24,275 --> 00:20:25,959
<i>And at each choice</i>

418
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:29,745
we take,
creates a new reality.

419
00:20:29,745 --> 00:20:31,217
<i>- Do you understand?
- Yes.</i>

420
00:20:31,252 --> 00:20:33,211
But what does it
have to do with déjà vu?

421
00:20:33,237 --> 00:20:36,640
Déjà vu is, is, is
simply a-a momentary glimpse

422
00:20:36,699 --> 00:20:37,489
to the other side.

423
00:20:37,645 --> 00:20:39,402
Almost
everyone experiences it.

424
00:20:39,575 --> 00:20:42,490
We feel that
we've been somewhere before

425
00:20:42,962 --> 00:20:46,691
because actually, we have...
in another reality.

426
00:20:47,649 --> 00:20:49,323
It's another path.

427
00:20:50,128 --> 00:20:51,512
The road not taken.

428
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:53,745
Walter, why me?

429
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:56,732
Why am I
seeing these visions?

430
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,596
I don't know.

431
00:21:06,545 --> 00:21:10,005
Walter,
what about William Bell's drug trials?

432
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:11,804
Cortexiphan.

433
00:21:13,345 --> 00:21:15,135
You said that
it worked on perception.

434
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:15,663
Yes.

435
00:21:15,703 --> 00:21:18,667
If it's true and
I was part of the trials

436
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:19,685
when I was a kid...

437
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:23,503
Is it possible
that it's causing these visions?

438
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:24,843
I don't know.

439
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:30,315
But what I do know is that
you are a committed investigator.

440
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:31,973
You're a perceptive agent.

441
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:34,898
If you are having these visions,
whatever they are,

442
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,449
there must be a reason.

443
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:37,508
Trust me.

444
00:21:37,545 --> 00:21:38,408
<i>Really, Walter...</i>

445
00:21:38,537 --> 00:21:39,857
From a man
who routinely sees

446
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:41,439
little green men
prancing through the lab

447
00:21:41,474 --> 00:21:42,491
when
Tam O'Shanters on?

448
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:44,773
<i>Hey, I think
I found something.</i>

449
00:21:45,975 --> 00:21:46,982
It's another victim...

450
00:21:47,065 --> 00:21:48,936
who died the same way
Susan Pratt did.

451
00:21:49,415 --> 00:21:51,486
<i>I checked it out and
the guy who runs the web site</i>

452
00:21:51,535 --> 00:21:52,606
<i>lives in Malden.</i>

453
00:22:00,365 --> 00:22:01,105
<i>Yes?</i>

454
00:22:01,106 --> 00:22:02,406
Uh, my name is
Olivia Dunham.

455
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:04,363
I'm a special agent
with the FBI.

456
00:22:04,398 --> 00:22:06,564
<i>We need to speak to
Emmanuel Grayson.</i>

457
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:08,374
<i>May I see your credentials,
please?</i>

458
00:22:23,461 --> 00:22:24,944
Mr. Grayson,
you operate a web site

459
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:28,795
called "Galaxy Truths",
where you claim to uncover

460
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:31,360
conspiracies perpetrated by
foreign governments.

461
00:22:31,395 --> 00:22:33,692
I don't claim.
I accomplish.

462
00:22:34,564 --> 00:22:35,803
Unlike you two.

463
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:38,161
<i>You're just pawns being used
by the government</i>

464
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:39,680
<i>to spread
their propaganda.</i>

465
00:22:39,715 --> 00:22:42,135
<i>Look, I can appreciate your opinion,
Mr. Grayson.</i>

466
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,459
- We just want you to ask a few--
- No, no. Look. Look.

467
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:44,549
You're right, okay?

468
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:45,932
<i>She's a fed, but I'm not.</i>

469
00:22:46,167 --> 00:22:47,282
<i>I'm just like you.</i>

470
00:22:47,317 --> 00:22:49,289
I am a citizen
in search of the truth.

471
00:22:49,324 --> 00:22:50,041
Give me the photo.

472
00:22:50,924 --> 00:22:52,551
We downloaded this off
of your web site.

473
00:22:52,786 --> 00:22:54,221
It claims that
this person was a victim

474
00:22:54,256 --> 00:22:55,658
of spontaneous
human combustion.

475
00:22:55,693 --> 00:22:58,278
Now you gotta tell us,
where did this one happen?

476
00:22:58,613 --> 00:23:01,187
Budapest.
Three weeks ago.

477
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:03,747
The victim was an
American graduate student on holiday.

478
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,487
The Hungarian police
say he was attacked

479
00:23:06,522 --> 00:23:08,833
and set on fire.
That's not the truth.

480
00:23:08,868 --> 00:23:09,891
Why do you say that?

481
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:12,764
Are you familiar with
William Bell?

482
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:15,002
Of course.

483
00:23:16,375 --> 00:23:18,192
William Bell
killed these people.

484
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:20,487
What do you mean?

485
00:23:20,575 --> 00:23:22,802
William Bell's company
Massive Dynamic

486
00:23:23,137 --> 00:23:26,634
is a cover for all manner
of unethical behavior.

487
00:23:27,175 --> 00:23:28,214
Multi-national,

488
00:23:28,271 --> 00:23:30,515
outside the purview
of government control.

489
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:32,582
He founded it
to continue his

490
00:23:32,622 --> 00:23:34,209
experiments
with impunity.

491
00:23:35,145 --> 00:23:37,729
Among them,
secret drug trials.

492
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,040
This was
one of his test subjects.

493
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,846
Then why would
William Bell have him killed?

494
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:46,499
Well, he didn't.
At least not intentionally.

495
00:23:46,737 --> 00:23:49,345
You see, Bell is trying
to activate his subjects...

496
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,445
to see which ones
were successful.

497
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:55,289
Some can handle the process.
Others can't.

498
00:23:55,375 --> 00:23:58,084
- What process?
- To create super soldiers.

499
00:23:58,115 --> 00:24:00,403
- Super soldiers.
- Yes.

500
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:02,856
Like Khan Noonien Singh.

501
00:24:02,945 --> 00:24:04,496
<i>To defend us
in a coming war.</i>

502
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,491
- What war?
- I'm sorry.

503
00:24:07,915 --> 00:24:09,445
- The Khan?
- Yes.

504
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:12,295
- As in the Wrath of...
- Yes.

505
00:24:12,475 --> 00:24:16,345
Let me guess.
This war, it's against...

506
00:24:16,645 --> 00:24:17,554
The Romulans.

507
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:19,961
<i>Renegade Romulans
from the future.</i>

508
00:24:20,015 --> 00:24:21,883
<i>Here to change
the timeline.</i>

509
00:24:21,926 --> 00:24:23,710
The sworn enemy
of the Federation.

510
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:24,861
<i>The Federation.</i>

511
00:24:24,872 --> 00:24:27,231
That would be
the United Federation of Planets.

512
00:24:27,615 --> 00:24:28,929
- Yes.
- <i>Hmm.</i>

513
00:24:29,619 --> 00:24:31,411
And you know all this
because...

514
00:24:31,467 --> 00:24:33,145
I am
the Son of Seric.

515
00:24:33,515 --> 00:24:34,969
Which makes you Spock.

516
00:24:35,215 --> 00:24:36,114
Yes.

517
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:40,902
Well, Mr. Spock,
thank you for your time.

518
00:24:41,468 --> 00:24:43,135
We'll let you get back
to the bridge now.

519
00:24:43,893 --> 00:24:45,749
Live long and prosper.

520
00:24:46,645 --> 00:24:49,207
<i>Okay, yes,
you were right.</i>

521
00:24:49,242 --> 00:24:50,079
<i>But see that?

522
00:24:50,125 --> 00:24:51,724
I'm a big enough girl
to admit when I'm wrong.

523
00:24:52,775 --> 00:24:54,812
Oh, but I think we can
prepare for that possibility.

524
00:24:54,843 --> 00:24:55,830
It shouldn't be
a problem.

525
00:24:56,567 --> 00:24:58,970
Uh, Mr. Prime Minister,
I'm very sorry,

526
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:00,285
would you mind holding
for just a moment?

527
00:25:00,323 --> 00:25:01,012
Thanks.

528
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:05,686
Hello.
When?

529
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:10,016
Well, no.
Don't do that.

530
00:25:10,234 --> 00:25:12,043
Don't do anything
until I get there.

531
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,635
Sir, I'm so sorry.
Something has just come up.

532
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:20,508
If you'll excuse me.
Yes. You too.

533
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,678
Get me
to the helicopter fast.

534
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,526
<i>What if
we're overlooking something?</i>

535
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,041
What if Emmanuel Grayson
was right?

536
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,444
About which part?
Being from Planet Vulcan?

537
00:25:40,905 --> 00:25:42,629
No.
Forget that.

538
00:25:44,525 --> 00:25:46,020
But some of what he said
made sense.

539
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:48,392
We already know that
William Bell conducted drug trials

540
00:25:48,469 --> 00:25:49,712
with experimental drugs.

541
00:25:50,988 --> 00:25:52,747
Cortexiphan,
for one.

542
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,692
Do you have anything stronger
for my coffee?

543
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,093
Uh, yeah. Bottom drawer.
In the cabinet behind you.

544
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,339
And here
I was halfway kidding.

545
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:10,110
What?

546
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,866
What your father said about
me having these visions

547
00:26:13,901 --> 00:26:14,807
for a reason.

548
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,213
<i>Maybe there's a clue in them
that I'm meant to find.</i>

549
00:26:17,248 --> 00:26:17,981
Meaning what?

550
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,887
<i>We have one victim.
Susan Pratt.</i>

551
00:26:19,932 --> 00:26:22,529
<i>But in my visions,
there are always two bodies.</i>

552
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,712
- Who are they?
- I don't know. Unidentified.

553
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,865
But maybe
if I could get back

554
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:29,718
<i>to that parallel universe
as Walter describes,</i>

555
00:26:29,753 --> 00:26:31,435
<i>I can ID
that second charred body.</i>

556
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,148
Maybe what's happening there
could help us understand

557
00:26:34,179 --> 00:26:35,869
- what's happening here.
- <i>Happening where?</i>

558
00:26:37,749 --> 00:26:38,467
Nowhere.

559
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:44,362
Your new assignment.

560
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:47,488
Always
a pleasure seeing you, sir.

561
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,995
Hey!
Wait a sec. Harris.

562
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,274
Can you stop?

563
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:07,708
You want me
to submit for a psych exam?

564
00:27:07,743 --> 00:27:09,750
That's right.
I'm concerned for you.

565
00:27:09,785 --> 00:27:11,549
- Why?
- I've read your briefs.

566
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,070
And I'd say your analysis borders
on the paranoid.

567
00:27:14,105 --> 00:27:16,075
Besides which,
your behavior's been noted

568
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:19,780
as erratic and driven by emotion
and not just by me.

569
00:27:19,815 --> 00:27:21,503
Oh, that is not
what this is about.

570
00:27:21,538 --> 00:27:22,780
My colleagues
need to trust me.

571
00:27:22,815 --> 00:27:23,891
They need
to depend on me.

572
00:27:23,957 --> 00:27:25,231
Not wonder
in the back of their minds,

573
00:27:25,251 --> 00:27:26,355
whether or not
I'm losing mine.

574
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:28,012
Look,
this job is intense.

575
00:27:28,101 --> 00:27:28,960
- Not wondering to--
- This has got nothing to do

576
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,223
with my ability
to do my job.

577
00:27:30,258 --> 00:27:31,257
- This is about something else.
- This is exactly what

578
00:27:31,292 --> 00:27:32,283
- This is about you and me.
- I'm talking about...

579
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:34,576
Because right now,
you are acting emotionally.

580
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,594
Yes, you're right,
I am.

581
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,686
You know,
I've tried to move past our history.

582
00:27:37,721 --> 00:27:39,393
I've tried to reason
with you in the interest

583
00:27:39,428 --> 00:27:40,589
of a working relationship.

584
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,932
But you seem to
get off on this.

585
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,853
So fine.

586
00:27:44,097 --> 00:27:45,338
<i>I don't give
a damn anymore.</i>

587
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:48,350
But I am not going to let you
undermine my ability to do my job.

588
00:27:48,385 --> 00:27:50,773
You can color this
any way you like, Dunham.

589
00:27:50,808 --> 00:27:52,734
But I am still
your superior officer

590
00:27:52,769 --> 00:27:54,692
and that evaluation
is a direct order.

591
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,820
<i>We need to
get their statements...</i>

592
00:28:40,855 --> 00:28:43,459
<i>You put a shoot to kill order
out on the perps.</i>

593
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,035
<i>You understand me?
Don't get close to them.</i>

594
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,975
- Charlie.
- Yeah, what's up?

595
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:51,128
I was wondering
where we were

596
00:28:51,163 --> 00:28:52,452
on the
Susan Pratt case.

597
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:55,567
We're at nowhere.
Same place we were yesterday.

598
00:28:55,902 --> 00:28:57,049
I'd like to look again.

599
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,335
You have half of Boston
in quarantined lockdown.

600
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,322
And you're worried about
a pair of charred twins?

601
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,816
Twins?

602
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,685
Sorry.
Didn't see you.

603
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:36,051
<i>We already ran
Susan's bio.</i>

604
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,217
- Well, we didn't find a sister.
- I know.

605
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,235
And what makes
you think--

606
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:41,639
<i>Look.
You were right.</i>

607
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,199
Nancy Lewis.

608
00:29:45,148 --> 00:29:46,889
who went missing
11 years ago.

609
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,484
Maybe Susan ran away.

610
00:29:50,387 --> 00:29:51,365
<i>Changed her identity.</i>

611
00:29:51,395 --> 00:29:53,145
She must've been running
pretty hard.

612
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,470
Where does Nancy live?

613
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,322
She's local.
934 Whittier.

614
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,250
Thanks, Charlie.

615
00:30:14,636 --> 00:30:15,236
Hi.

616
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,247
Can I help you?

617
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,608
Nancy Lewis,
my name is Isaac Winters.

618
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:35,319
<i>Nancy Lewis.
FBI.</i>

619
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,140
<i>We need to
ask you some questions.</i>

620
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:38,880
<i>It's unlocked.</i>

621
00:30:53,107 --> 00:30:54,133
<i>Nancy.</i>

622
00:31:03,007 --> 00:31:04,079
Coffee's still hot.

623
00:31:08,907 --> 00:31:09,879
Uh,
this is Dunham.

624
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:13,643
<i>I need immediate forensic dispatch
to 934 Whittier.</i>

625
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:14,923
<i>Apartment 210.</i>

626
00:31:17,067 --> 00:31:17,685
Dunham.

627
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:19,264
<i>Take a look at this.</i>

628
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:21,509
The glass
has been melted.

629
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:25,900
You think she's starting fires
like her sister?

630
00:31:27,323 --> 00:31:28,166
What is it?

631
00:31:30,207 --> 00:31:31,354
I got an idea.

632
00:31:36,078 --> 00:31:37,197
I'm not sure.

633
00:31:37,707 --> 00:31:38,546
I got it.

634
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:41,152
<i>Yeah, I knew.
I had to, uh...</i>

635
00:31:43,207 --> 00:31:44,134
<i>Please don't
touch that window.</i>

636
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:45,322
We haven't pulled
prints yet.

637
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:46,709
You're not gonna need to.

638
00:31:46,754 --> 00:31:48,535
I think the protocols
and the processing of evidence

639
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:49,372
are pretty clear.

640
00:31:49,463 --> 00:31:51,553
Let me guess,
you're new around here.

641
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:54,888
- Is everything all right?
- <i>Yeah, everything's fine.</i>

642
00:31:54,923 --> 00:31:57,478
Just tell Mr. Protocol
to let me do my job, please.

643
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,453
<i>Uh, it's okay.
He's with me.</i>

644
00:31:59,937 --> 00:32:01,936
Are you, uh,
ever gonna tell me

645
00:32:01,966 --> 00:32:03,334
what it is
that you are actually doing?

646
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:05,368
<i>Help me with this first.
Hold the glass up here.</i>

647
00:32:08,552 --> 00:32:09,408
Gently.

648
00:32:15,937 --> 00:32:17,465
<i>We all hope
that this is important.</i>

649
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:20,044
I was about
to take my bathe.

650
00:32:21,633 --> 00:32:22,428
Hey.

651
00:32:23,021 --> 00:32:24,259
You have any problem
taking it apart?

652
00:32:24,494 --> 00:32:26,764
Walter tried to take back
the electron microscope.

653
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,450
But I convinced him
that you needed it.

654
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
So what's going on?

655
00:32:30,915 --> 00:32:32,267
Nancy Lewis
was kidnapped.

656
00:32:32,855 --> 00:32:34,219
<i>And we're gonna find out
who did it.</i>

657
00:32:47,024 --> 00:32:48,859
I've seen
this woman before.

658
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:51,705
But why does she look
so familiar?

659
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,861
Maybe because you dissected
her twin sister yesterday.

660
00:32:55,746 --> 00:32:57,804
Remember?
Blond girl about 5'7".

661
00:32:58,114 --> 00:33:00,256
Really well done.
Melted fillings.

662
00:33:02,737 --> 00:33:03,740
Astrid...

663
00:33:03,956 --> 00:33:05,591
Can you plug that in
to the DVI input?

664
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:06,412
Yes.

665
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:10,719
Okay.
Here's the deal.

666
00:33:10,737 --> 00:33:13,442
Walter, the project
that I've been working on...

667
00:33:13,582 --> 00:33:14,420
was for you.

668
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:15,572
For me?

669
00:33:15,607 --> 00:33:16,896
<i>It reconstructs audio.</i>

670
00:33:16,931 --> 00:33:18,289
I wanted you to be able
to digitize

671
00:33:18,324 --> 00:33:20,449
some of those old water-damaged
vinyl records you have.

672
00:33:20,484 --> 00:33:21,757
<i>I know how much that
mean to you.</i>

673
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,507
Thank you, son.

674
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:27,811
You know,
when he was five,

675
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:31,496
he--he built me
a popsicle napkin holder.

676
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:33,685
Dreadful design.

677
00:33:33,729 --> 00:33:35,209
<i>Utterly useless.</i>

678
00:33:35,658 --> 00:33:36,364
Thank you.

679
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:39,725
But this--
This is...

680
00:33:42,152 --> 00:33:42,919
You're welcome.

681
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:46,925
Anyway, the basic principles
at work here are very simple.

682
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,614
<i>You all know how
a record player works, right?</i>

683
00:33:48,649 --> 00:33:49,546
<i>Yeah.
A needle goes over</i>

684
00:33:49,618 --> 00:33:50,588
the grooves of the vinyl

685
00:33:50,623 --> 00:33:53,019
and the vibrations it picks up
are amplified into sound.

686
00:33:53,054 --> 00:33:54,776
Exactly.
So the principle is the same.

687
00:33:54,811 --> 00:33:56,147
Except for
instead of a needle,

688
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:58,866
I use the electron microscope
to take a high resolution,

689
00:33:58,901 --> 00:34:00,991
<i>digital image of the grooves
on the surface of the record.</i>

690
00:34:01,137 --> 00:34:03,071
That image is then
transferred into the computer,

691
00:34:03,206 --> 00:34:04,840
which translates it
back into audio

692
00:34:04,875 --> 00:34:05,630
<i>that we can hear.</i>

693
00:34:05,689 --> 00:34:07,097
You sound just like him.

694
00:34:09,307 --> 00:34:12,305
I'm guessing that with
the software modifications I gave you,

695
00:34:12,337 --> 00:34:14,309
we're gonna be able to do
the same thing with this.

696
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:15,613
<i>So you're saying that</i>

697
00:34:15,643 --> 00:34:17,382
you can play back
the glass somehow.

698
00:34:17,417 --> 00:34:18,025
Yeah.

699
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:18,970
Walter says that

700
00:34:18,971 --> 00:34:20,661
<i>these pyrotechnic abilities
only occur</i>

701
00:34:20,696 --> 00:34:22,334
<i>during times
of emotional stress.</i>

702
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:24,260
I think that
when our twin was kidnapped,

703
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:26,442
the heat that she generated
caused that window

704
00:34:26,477 --> 00:34:27,829
<i>to liquefy slightly.</i>

705
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:28,671
<i>Which means...</i>

706
00:34:28,698 --> 00:34:30,796
that any sound that was
in this room at that time

707
00:34:30,831 --> 00:34:33,728
would've left microscopic impressions
in the molten glass.

708
00:34:33,763 --> 00:34:35,158
Like the grooves on a record.

709
00:34:35,593 --> 00:34:36,642
Exactly right.

710
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:38,633
<i>Now if you'll please
scan the glass.</i>

711
00:34:41,967 --> 00:34:43,672
<i>Okay.
You're ready to go.</i>

712
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:45,496
All right.

713
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:48,918
It's transferring
into the sound processor now.

714
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:50,959
Let's see what we got.

715
00:34:55,031 --> 00:34:57,311
That could've been
one of my records.

716
00:34:58,191 --> 00:34:59,322
<i>It's okay.
It's okay.</i>

717
00:34:59,357 --> 00:35:01,352
I already have a digital scan
of the glass in here.

718
00:35:01,387 --> 00:35:03,324
<i>Let's try that again,
shall we?</i>

719
00:35:04,298 --> 00:35:05,506
Just slow it down.

720
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,053
<i>I don't understand.
It should be working.</i>

721
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:22,636
Yes. Yes.

722
00:35:24,942 --> 00:35:27,404
Now attenuate
for ambient noise.

723
00:35:32,786 --> 00:35:34,144
<i>Get out of here.</i>

724
00:35:35,042 --> 00:35:35,785
<i>Stay away.</i>

725
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,588
<i>What do you want?!</i>

726
00:35:42,237 --> 00:35:43,646
<i>Please!</i>

727
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:48,770
<i>See you there.</i>

728
00:35:50,308 --> 00:35:51,233
Poor dear.

729
00:35:55,035 --> 00:35:57,487
Peter, can you play it back
from when he starts to talk?

730
00:35:57,522 --> 00:35:58,744
Yeah.
One sec.

731
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:05,098
Okay, just there.
Where he's dialing.

732
00:36:05,907 --> 00:36:07,509
<i>Okay, can you
make that clearer?</i>

733
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:11,621
Sure. Let me just...
isolate the sound.

734
00:36:17,161 --> 00:36:18,645
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

735
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:20,998
My cell phone app can
dial the number from the tones.

736
00:36:34,596 --> 00:36:35,878
This is Harris.

737
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:42,968
<i>Hey, Charlie.</i>

738
00:36:43,014 --> 00:36:44,166
I'm headed out
for a few hours.

739
00:36:44,216 --> 00:36:45,963
Anybody needs me,
I'm reachable by cell.

740
00:36:46,146 --> 00:36:46,878
You got it.

741
00:37:03,016 --> 00:37:04,840
I got him, Charlie.
He's headed west.

742
00:37:05,586 --> 00:37:06,599
I'm right behind you.

743
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,058
<i>Charlie,
he's approaching a warehouse</i>

744
00:37:48,093 --> 00:37:49,530
<i>off Moore and Adams.</i>

745
00:37:52,016 --> 00:37:52,661
<i>Roger that.</i>

746
00:37:52,712 --> 00:37:54,551
<i>We're turning onto Adams
right now.</i>

747
00:38:14,308 --> 00:38:14,779
Hey.

748
00:38:15,186 --> 00:38:16,894
He used a remote
to get in.

749
00:38:17,116 --> 00:38:18,754
I guess we go
with the old-fashioned way.

750
00:38:43,461 --> 00:38:45,361
No thermal activity yet.

751
00:38:45,396 --> 00:38:46,890
<i>Her body temperature's
normal.</i>

752
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:48,004
We'll know more soon.

753
00:38:48,027 --> 00:38:49,416
<i>Well,
he's losing patience.</i>

754
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:50,763
We need her active.
Get it done.

755
00:39:37,686 --> 00:39:39,719
<i>Liv, I heard gunshots.
Are you okay?</i>

756
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,404
Charlie,
we've got a man down.

757
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:56,181
Charlie,
I've got her.

758
00:39:56,267 --> 00:39:57,942
Back northwest corner.

759
00:39:59,746 --> 00:40:01,704
I'm Olivia.
I am with the FBI.

760
00:40:01,739 --> 00:40:02,455
Help me.
Please.

761
00:40:02,490 --> 00:40:03,814
Don't worry.
You're gonna be okay.

762
00:40:04,909 --> 00:40:05,802
No!

763
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:08,834
Harris,
open the door!

764
00:40:10,386 --> 00:40:12,555
God damn it, Harris.
Open the door.

765
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,562
Open the door!

766
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:18,128
I can't breathe.

767
00:40:19,686 --> 00:40:20,711
<i>Well,
look at that.</i>

768
00:40:23,716 --> 00:40:25,275
<i>Good work,
Agent Dunham.</i>

769
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:26,956
You managed
to activate her

770
00:40:26,986 --> 00:40:27,744
<i>before we could.</i>

771
00:40:27,785 --> 00:40:29,135
Damn it, Harris,
open the door.

772
00:40:29,181 --> 00:40:30,143
She needs help.

773
00:40:30,178 --> 00:40:31,313
Not if
she can control it.

774
00:40:31,348 --> 00:40:32,003
And if not,

775
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:33,547
<i>she'll explode
and kill the both of you.</i>

776
00:40:33,577 --> 00:40:35,480
So one problem
solves another.

777
00:40:36,516 --> 00:40:37,162
Ah!

778
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,105
<i>I'm burning up!</i>

779
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,934
<i>You're gonna be okay.</i>

780
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,968
Just calm down.
Just calm down.

781
00:40:42,716 --> 00:40:44,641
<i>Yeah, it's me.
I need to speak to him.</i>

782
00:40:44,716 --> 00:40:46,545
Just hold on.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

783
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,214
It worked. She's hot.
We have an active.

784
00:40:49,249 --> 00:40:51,166
But she's a loss.
She's highly unstable.

785
00:40:51,301 --> 00:40:52,692
Why is this
happening to me?

786
00:40:52,747 --> 00:40:54,894
They did something to you--
Maybe to both of us

787
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:56,631
a long time ago
when we were just kids.

788
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:58,627
And right now,
you're feeling the effects from that.

789
00:40:58,662 --> 00:41:01,155
But you can control this, okay?

790
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,318
You can control this
and I'm gonna help you.

791
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,713
I just need you to
focus the heat away from us.

792
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:07,518
- No, I can't.
- Yes, you can.

793
00:41:07,553 --> 00:41:09,223
Just focus.
Focus on anything.

794
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:10,590
Just focus, Nancy.

795
00:41:10,786 --> 00:41:12,459
You can do this, Nancy.

796
00:41:12,955 --> 00:41:14,649
- No, I can't.
- You can.

797
00:41:15,593 --> 00:41:16,689
<i>Yeah,
I'll take care of it.</i>

798
00:41:16,733 --> 00:41:17,911
<i>There won't even
be a trace.</i>

799
00:41:18,616 --> 00:41:20,558
<i>I, uh, uh...</i>

800
00:41:37,746 --> 00:41:41,504
Oh! It's okay.
Everything's gonna be okay.

801
00:41:41,786 --> 00:41:44,150
Oh, yeah.
You're gonna be okay.

802
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:49,353
Oh, it's okay.
It's okay.

803
00:41:57,687 --> 00:41:59,480
Okay.
I think you got all of that, Walter.

804
00:42:00,116 --> 00:42:01,611
I'm gonna use the bathroom.
Be right back.

805
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,786
Excuse me.
Could you keep an eye on him,

806
00:42:04,786 --> 00:42:05,948
make sure
he doesn't leave?

807
00:42:12,386 --> 00:42:14,009
Agent Dunham.

808
00:42:15,124 --> 00:42:16,041
<i>Where's Peter?</i>

809
00:42:17,382 --> 00:42:18,850
<i>Peter's
in the bathroom.</i>

810
00:42:23,341 --> 00:42:25,667
What the hell
did you people do to us?

811
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:38,362
You and William Bell,
Walter.

812
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:41,172
What did you do to me?

813
00:42:44,686 --> 00:42:45,829
<i>Susan Pratt...</i>

814
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:50,783
and Nancy Lewis are
from Jacksonville, Florida.

815
00:42:51,816 --> 00:42:53,177
Just like Nick Lane,

816
00:42:54,316 --> 00:42:56,299
the guy that
you conducted drug trials on

817
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:57,313
when he was a kid.

818
00:42:58,186 --> 00:43:00,220
The drug trials
that you conducted on me.

819
00:43:03,176 --> 00:43:04,345
They were Belly's.

820
00:43:04,786 --> 00:43:06,278
They're Belly's trials.

821
00:43:06,313 --> 00:43:07,665
But you knew.

822
00:43:09,625 --> 00:43:12,317
Walter,
you were there and you knew.

823
00:43:12,452 --> 00:43:13,954
We were
trying to help.

824
00:43:15,045 --> 00:43:16,458
It meant no harm.

825
00:43:16,493 --> 00:43:17,280
No harm?

826
00:43:17,315 --> 00:43:22,268
You were drugging children.
Three-year-old children, Walter.

827
00:43:22,716 --> 00:43:24,153
Why did you do it?

828
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,358
We were
trying to prepare you.

829
00:43:28,516 --> 00:43:32,517
To make you capable.
Able.

830
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,001
Something terrible
is coming.

831
00:43:38,036 --> 00:43:40,885
- What?
- I don't know.

832
00:43:42,351 --> 00:43:44,153
Walter,
what did you do to us?

833
00:43:44,446 --> 00:43:45,741
I don't know.

834
00:43:46,446 --> 00:43:49,255
- Damm it, Walter. You do.
- No, I don't.

835
00:43:51,133 --> 00:43:52,419
I don't.

836
00:43:53,086 --> 00:43:56,419
I-I can't remember.

837
00:44:02,686 --> 00:44:04,219
I'm sorry.

838
00:44:33,483 --> 00:44:34,084
Hey.

839
00:44:35,516 --> 00:44:37,107
Hey.
Walter.

840
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:40,498
What just happened?

841
00:45:31,743 --> 00:45:34,352
Nina.
What is it?

842
00:45:34,946 --> 00:45:37,045
These were all taken
in the last 24 hours.

843
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,298
<i>You know what happened
the last time he appeared</i>

844
00:45:40,546 --> 00:45:42,159
<i>with this
kind of frequency.</i>

845
00:45:44,329 --> 00:45:45,492
We need to talk.

846
00:47:00,486 --> 00:47:01,770
Astrid,
I found it.

847
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:05,657
The original manuscript
with the extra pages.

848
00:47:06,216 --> 00:47:08,857
I was right.
Listen to this.

849
00:47:10,416 --> 00:47:13,504
"Our children
are our greatest resource.

850
00:47:14,016 --> 00:47:16,631
"We must nurture them
and protect them.

851
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:22,233
"We must prepare them
so they can one day protect us."

852
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:24,115
You see, I was...

853
00:47:26,816 --> 00:47:28,330
Hello, Walter.

854
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:32,500
Oh. Hello.

855
00:47:34,492 --> 00:47:35,831
It's time to go.

856
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:42,317
Is it time?

857
00:47:57,116 --> 00:47:58,564
I'll get my coat.

858
00:48:31,836 --> 00:48:32,607
Evening.

859
