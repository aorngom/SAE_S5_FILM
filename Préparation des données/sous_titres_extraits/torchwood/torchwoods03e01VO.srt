1
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,520
Come on, Tyler. Tyler, just stop it.

2
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,640
I haven't got time to muck around.

3
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,840
Tyler! All right, I'll just leave
you there. Is that what you want?

4
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,800
If I just leave you?
In the middle of town?

5
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,360
We're going to be late.

6
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,200
Suzette! Stop it, you're just
looking silly, d'you want other
people to see you, looking silly?.

7
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,880
If he gives you any more trouble,
your dad's going to punch
his face in.

8
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,200
I'll punch his bloody mother.
Have you got that, David?

9
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,240
I've booked the car for 7.30, but I
might have to leave it on standby.

10
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:20,000
If Baxter starts talking,
he never stops, so I can't
guarantee what time.

11
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,920
I'll tell you what, I'll send you
a text when I'm on the motorway.

12
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,880
Steven!
if you leave the front door open,
those cats are going to get in.

13
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,200
Darling, don't just stand there,
you're gonna be late.

14
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,280
Steven.

15
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,280
Steven?

16
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,320
Stop playing games!
Get out of the way!

17
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,920
CAR HORNS BLARE

18
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,840
Oi! I said bloody shift, man!

19
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:55,600
David? Are you listening to me?

20
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:00,880
Mica? Oi, you two! Look at me!

21
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,840
See ya then!

22
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:19,360
And you can shut up an' all,
you were the one crying, you
were like a baby, I seen you.

23
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,800
Was not. Was. Was not.

24
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,440
You two, you're gonna be late.
We're going! Look!

25
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,680
I'm going round to
Polly's later, see ya, bye!

26
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,720
What? You are pushing it,
you are, young man. Come on!

27
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:51,560
All right, Glyn? What's occurring?

28
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,280
I've been watching the bay.

29
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,840
No sea monsters. Ah, still early.

30
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,120
Anyone in?

31
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:20,360
You two having shenanigans
in the dark? Jack?

32
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,920
Morning.

33
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,640
Clear! And again! Charging 200.
Clear!

34
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,840
MONITOR FLATLINES

35
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,600
I think we should call it,
everyone agree?

36
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,800
OK. Time of death, 09.17.

37
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,880
Sally, I can leave it with you,
yeah? I'll go and tell them.

38
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,800
I'm sorry.

39
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,280
We did everything we could,

40
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:07,280
but he didn't make it.
Oh, that's a shame.

41
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,760
Very sad. Poor old Mr Williams.
Very sad indeed.

42
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,600
There'll have to be an autopsy,
but I'd say his heart gave out.

43
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,000
Brave old heart.

44
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,320
You were neighbours, is that right?

45
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,360
We live next door.

46
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,960
He's got no family to speak of.

47
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,680
All on his own. We'd just keep an
eye on him, y'know.

48
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,360
Well, I'm sure he appreciated it.

49
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,000
If only there were more like
you two in the world.

50
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,840
I know it's an imposition, but with
us being such good neighbours...

51
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,240
Can we see the body?

52
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,160
Bless him. God rest his soul.

53
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,360
Say, d'you think we could, er...?
Just on our own, um...

54
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,960
Course you can.

55
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,520
Just come and find me,
once you're done.

56
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,160
And I'm sorry for your loss.
Thank you.

57
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,040
He thought we were together.
Like a couple. He said, "You two."

58
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:08,120
The way he said it, huh. "You two."

59
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,000
Well, we are. Does it matter?

60
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,680
I dunno, it's all a bit
new to me, that's all.

61
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,880
Laser saw. Thank you.

62
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,800
Tongs. Tongs.

63
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,600
Almost...

64
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,160
..got it.

65
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,360
Sorry, one more....

66
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,480
There! What?

67
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,320
Now, look at it, that's not human,
is it, does that look human?
No, it does not.

68
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,560
It's just a hitchhiker he
picked up, it didn't kill him.

69
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,800
Some say they're positively
beneficial, they release endorphins.

70
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,920
He died a happy man.
And I've got Tupperware.

71
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,720
And we're very considerate,
we don't leave any mess.

72
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,480
Thank you very much.
We'll just get out of your way.

73
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,120
Wait a minute, wait a minute!

74
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,800
Whatever it was, that was
mutilation, I should report you.
Then why don't you?

75
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,000
But that thing, what the
hell was it, that hitchhiker?

76
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,240
Try putting it into a report.

77
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,720
You're Torchwood?
Never heard of 'em.

78
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,480
There are bodies going missing!

79
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,000
How many?

80
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,520
This whole city talks about you.

81
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
What bodies, where?

82
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,040
It started two months ago.

83
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,840
Bodies, taken down to the mortuary,
then the records just stop.

84
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,400
Five of them. Five in two months.

85
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,440
And none of them white.

86
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,000
One of West Indian decent, one
African, three Chinese, all male.

87
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,360
What was your name again? Rupesh.

88
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,680
Rupesh Patanjali.

89
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,040
What d'you think? NHS.

90
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:59,280
Yeah. Too much red tape.
Sorry. But good luck with it!

91
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,040
Don't! Look, wait a minute!

92
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,920
Oh, Christ. Good morning, sir.
Morning. Morning to you, too.

93
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,240
Colonel Oduya for you, sir.
Unscheduled.

94
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,600
I'd remind you, you've got the
Category Meeting at quarter past.

95
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,840
You'd better come through.
Thank you.

96
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,360
I'm late!

97
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,080
I'm sorry! Oh, my God, I'm really,
really sorry! Good morning.

98
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,920
Bridget Spears. Lois Habiba.

99
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:20,040
Right. This will be your desk.

100
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,480
Just tell me it's something small.

101
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,520
Tell me it's a... It's a meteorite!

102
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,400
Or a shadow on the moon.

103
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,040
Just for once, tell me it's easy.

104
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,120
Might be nothing, sir.

105
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,560
But it's my job to inform the
Government, even if it turns
out to be a false alarm.

106
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,120
Then what is it?

107
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,800
Children, sir. It's the children.

108
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,320
You are gonna get us killed!

109
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,240
No, you get killed, not me. You'd
die like a dog, like an ugly dog!

110
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,520
Oi, Chuckle Brothers.
I found something.

111
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,600
I want a check on
St Helen's Hospital morgue.
There's a computer, do it yourself.

112
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
I've got reports this morning of
17 traffic accidents,

113
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,680
happening across the country,
from Glasgow to St Ives.
Is that above average?

114
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,880
Well, they all occurred between 8.40
and 8.41. 17 road traffic accidents
happening in exactly the same minute?

115
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,360
Every single one of
them involving children.

116
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,920
That'll be the school run. All of
them were just standing in the road.

117
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,760
Not crossing the road, just standing.

118
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:22,720
I saw it myself, Jack.
Two kids on Market Street.

119
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,480
Well, they just stopped.

120
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,200
But the accidents are
just one part of a picture.

121
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,080
Because every other child stopped at
the same time. And not just
in Britain.

122
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,000
Same reports from France.

123
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,560
15 road traffic accidents.

124
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,240
All timed around 9.40. They're an
hour ahead, so it was simultaneous.

125
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,880
All involving children? Yup. Hold
on. Cross-referencing. Here we go.

126
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,680
Reports coming in, RTAs in Norway.

127
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,760
Sweden. Denmark. Luxembourg.

128
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,400
Germany.

129
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,920
India. Egypt.

130
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,440
Guyana.

131
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,200
Spain. Portugal. Bosnia. Tokyo.

132
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,040
Singapore. At 8.40 GMT,
most of America was asleep,

133
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,880
but even there, we're
beginning to get reports.

134
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,520
I think we can assume
it's all of them, sir.

135
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:13,240
As far as we can tell, at 8.40
this morning, every single
child in the world stopped.

136
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,520
Seen anything like this before, Jack?

137
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,400
No way. Kids?

138
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,000
Until we receive further
information, we don't know if
it's extraterrestrial in origin.

139
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,240
Though the United Nations
has taken UNIT up to yellow
alert, just in case. Bloody hell.

140
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,720
And Colonel Mace?
How is he getting on? He's fine.

141
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,640
Wouldn't mind a
post in Vancouver myself.
Wonderful countryside, so they say.

142
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,800
Nice for some.

143
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,680
Sorry. My name's Lois, Lois Habiba.

144
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,520
Just started today. I'm helping
out Miss Spears while they
introduce the new computer system.

145
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,560
Thank you.

146
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:01,640
All done. What's his uniform?
That's not British Army, is it?

147
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:06,360
If you could start transferring
the names and addresses.

148
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,600
You have two
daughters, is that right?

149
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,200
Yeah. Maybe I should get them home
from school. I'd be careful, sir.

150
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I wouldn't do anything
to draw any attention.

151
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,200
Right now, this thing's random
enough to go unnoticed,

152
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,920
and if anyone files a news report,
we'll be crushing it.

153
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,360
But, so far, we're the only ones
with the software clever enough
to piece this all together.

154
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,000
Well, us and Torchwood.

155
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,880
D'you want me to talk to them?

156
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,760
They're a pain in the backside,
but they can be helpful.

157
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,200
We're on to them, right now.

158
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,240
OK, find out anything,
let me know immediately.

159
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,920
Of all the times for Martha Jones to
go on holiday. I get Sergeant Grunt.

160
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm talking to a sergeant! Don't you
dare phone her, she's
on her honeymoon.

161
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,600
What did they say? UNIT base in
Washington has run
some tests on a couple of kids.

162
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,600
Brain scans, blood sugar,
checking for radiation. Nothing.

163
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,000
You were right! He's back!

164
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,360
Ha! Ha! I said so!

165
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,520
Who's back?

166
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:14,080
What's he doing?
Waiting. Just like you said.
He's been there 20 minutes.

167
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,600
Persistent. Good sign.

168
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,040
Dogmatic. Always a plus.

169
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,240
Oh, Christ, never work with
a couple - you two talk like twins!

170
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,960
Now tell me who he is.

171
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,240
Rupesh Patanjali.
He saw the hitchhiker,
he's the bodies-going-missing man.

172
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,840
Dr Patanjali.

173
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,960
We need a doctor.

174
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,480
You let just him follow you?

175
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,440
Ask about Torchwood, and most
people point towards the Bay. Oh.

176
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,120
You bastards, that's exactly what
you did to me the first time we met!

177
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,320
Well, sod that, I'm promoting
myself to recruitment officer!

178
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,800
She's calling us a couple now.

179
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,720
What's your problem?

180
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,640
Just saying.
I hate the word "couple".

181
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,840
Me too.

182
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,360
Hey.

183
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,560
Rupesh, isn't it? Yeah.

184
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,480
Gwen Cooper.

185
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,120
I'm Torchwood.

186
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,840
Three of the bodies were Chinese?

187
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,480
Were they related?
No, one was 27-years-old
and the other two were in their 50s.

188
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,160
But not from the same family.

189
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,880
Bit odd, though, statistically.

190
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,800
In a city this small.

191
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
That's what I thought. Mind you.

192
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,640
Nothing compared to that hitchhiker.

193
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,920
Freak you out?
Oh, yeah! Yeah, me too.

194
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,760
Apparently, anyone could have one.

195
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,640
Don't! I know! This place!

196
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,400
Ever since I moved here,
it's just weird.

197
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,200
Where you from then?

198
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,120
Me? I'm from Chesterfield.

199
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,120
Came down here, 18 months back.

200
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,760
Enjoying it? Very much, yeah.

201
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,160
I bet it doesn't pay you much though.
Not at first. Could be worse.

202
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,760
Torchwood's paid by the Crown.

203
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,360
First pay cheque, I almost fell over.
Had to hide it from my boyfriend.

204
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:07,320
I was buying clothes, had
to stash them under the bed.

205
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:12,600
What's it like, inside Torchwood,
I mean, what do you do?

206
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
Why are you so interested? Well.

207
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,240
From what I've heard,

208
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,560
it sounds... I dunno.

209
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,960
Exciting? I suppose. Glamorous?

210
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,000
No, more, sort of...

211
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:31,600
The thing is, we've all seen it now,
the past few years. Alien life.

212
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,880
Even though half the
world's still denying it.

213
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,160
For me...

214
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,520
OK.

215
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,960
It's the suicides.

216
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:48,600
The past few years,
suicide rates have doubled, and
that's ever since the first alien.

217
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,760
My first case,
my first death, was a suicide.

218
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:54,280
D'you know why she did it?

219
00:15:54,280 --> 00:16:02,200
Cos she'd written all these letters,
she'd been a Christian all her life,
and then alien life appears.

220
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,840
She wrote this bit, she said,
"It's like science has won."

221
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,160
Lost her faith.

222
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,600
More than that.

223
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:15,280
She said she saw her
place in the universe,

224
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:18,320
and it was tiny.

225
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,640
She died because
she thought she was nothing.

226
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,520
I went through that.

227
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,200
Even now, I get terrified.

228
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,760
But at the same time,

229
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:37,840
it is brilliant, and beautiful,

230
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,640
and completely bloody magic.

231
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:45,000
It's bigger, y'know? It's like...

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,480
It's like the whole
wide world is bigger.

233
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,120
My life is bigger.

234
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,600
Shit!

235
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,280
Sasha, love, I haven't got time.
I've got to be in work.

236
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,880
Jack! Get up here!
It's happening again! The children!

237
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,440
They're doing it again!

238
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,680
Are you all right? We're fine, she's
just playing a game. OK.

239
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:21,000
Now come on, sweetheart,
people are staring at you!

240
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,880
Sasha, stop it.

241
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,720
HIGH-PITCHED SCREAMING

242
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,800
What's she doing? I don't know!

243
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:27,720
Sasha! Stop it! Please help her!
There's another one!

244
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,880
It's all right,
it's all right, I'm a doctor.

245
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,800
SCREAMING STOPS

246
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,800
We. We. We.

247
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:54,200
We. We. We. We.

248
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,800
We. We. Whoa!

249
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:02,960
We are. We are. We are. We are.

250
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,360
We are. We are coming.

251
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,040
We are coming. Oh, my God!

252
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,800
We are coming.
We are coming. We are coming.

253
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,640
Who's got children? Find me
a kid, find me a bloody kid, now!

254
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,280
He won't stop, he keeps
saying the same thing,

255
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,200
over and over.
We are coming. We are coming.

256
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,800
We are coming. We are coming.

257
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,560
We are coming.

258
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,400
We are coming. Sasha, please,
my God!

259
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,880
Who are you? Who's coming?

260
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,800
Come on then.

261
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,480
Why is that man filming us?

262
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:10,080
Are we gonna be on telly?

263
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,000
You all right?

264
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,400
They've found me.

265
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Gwen, I'll get on to
the Home Office.

266
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,320
This has gone public. They're gonna
need us. Whoa! Where'd you think
you're going?

267
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,400
Um. I dunno. I could help.

268
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,960
Doing what? You're bleeping.

269
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,600
Shit, yeah, sorry.
Whole city's coming to a standstill,
they're gonna need you in A&E.

270
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,480
We'll get back to you, I promise.
What's in there? Big science-fiction
superbase.

271
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,040
Honestly! See ya.

272
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:07,160
I'm sorry, we've got no comment.
Can we leave it for now?

273
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,840
I'm sorry, he's not
seeing anyone at the moment.

274
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:14,080
The Home Secretary's demanding
information, sir...

275
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,680
No, I'm sorry I don't know
who that is. I'm new.

276
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,120
Anyone else, just tell them
no, Bridget. No more calls.

277
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,120
I'll have to abandon the press
list, can you set up an autoreply?

278
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,280
You'll have to get into my account,
that's the username, spears,

279
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,320
password Hastings, capital H, rest
of it lower case. Right.

280
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,960
Bridget, I want to see Mr Frobisher.

281
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,400
Will you excuse me, please.

282
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,240
Sir? I said, no-one.

283
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,000
Mr Dekker, sir.

284
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,360
Four, five, six.

285
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,000
I warned you.

286
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:30,000
Tell him it's Captain Jack
Harkness, he'll take the call.

287
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,160
I'm sorry, I can't. If you
could just leave your number or...

288
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,800
'Tell him it's Torchwood.'

289
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,360
Right, and how do you spell that?

290
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,440
You work for the Home Office
and you've never heard of Torchwood?

291
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,040
I'm new. Started today.

292
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,600
Just what I need!

293
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,320
Sorry. Not your fault.

294
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,560
You picked a hell of a day.

295
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:53,400
'Just tell him Torchwood,
W-O-O-D.'

296
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,040
We might be able to help, OK?

297
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,680
What was your name?
Lois, Lois Habiba.

298
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,520
Good luck to you, Lois Habiba.

299
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,840
Right. Too many people here...

300
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:23,520
Been a while since we
had visitors down here.

301
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,960
Thought you'd forgotten about us.

302
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:30,560
It's hardly the glamorous side
of Thames House, my little domain.

303
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:35,000
We converted the readings
onto digital, years ago,

304
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,360
but I kept the original equipment.

305
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,800
Call it nostalgia.

306
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,120
Then this morning it woke up.

307
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:49,520
8.40, and again at 10.30,
transmitting on the 456.

308
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,880
WHOOSHING AND WHIRRING

309
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,480
Just five seconds in duration.

310
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,160
But that's enough. What's it saying?

311
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:10,240
Well, I think it's a burst of
compressed information.

312
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,920
I'm running it through the
translators, might take a while.

313
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:28,040
But the point is,

314
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,320
the 456 was open.

315
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:34,000
But why would they change?

316
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
That's your job, to find out.

317
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:38,760
I'll have to tell the Prime Minister.

318
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,160
Elected officials?!

319
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:47,040
They just come and go.
The 456 was here before him,
it'll be here long after he's gone.

320
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,400
And so will we.

321
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,320
The Civil Service, John,
the cockroaches of government.

322
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,880
Have you got kids?

323
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,000
Too busy working.

324
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,720
Turns out to be a Godsend.

325
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,800
So I think it's a transmission,
a pulse, a broadcast.

326
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,720
Like the Mosquito alarm - the
one that only kids can hear.

327
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,640
Unique to prepubescents.
Maybe testosterone interferes
with the signal, and oestrogen...

328
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,680
Oh, no, no, no, hold on.
We're being dumbos, we're missing
the bleedin' obvious here, look.

329
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,400
Recorded in Taiwan.
The point being, anyone?

330
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,360
We are coming. We are coming.

331
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,840
It's English.
They're speaking English. Exactly!
And all the footage is the same.

332
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,640
So every single child in the whole
wide world is speaking English,
so why's that?

333
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,480
I guess if you scanned the Earth
from the outside, you'd register
English as the dominant language.

334
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:45,480
That would be Chinese - Mandarin.
There's a billion people
speaking Mandarin.

335
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,040
That's three times more than
English. Oh, my God. What?

336
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:53,240
OK, ready? So every single child in
the world is talking in unison, yeah?

337
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,480
Yeah. Yup.
Every single child... And one man.

338
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,320
We are coming. We are coming.

339
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,040
What the hell? Who's he?

340
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:07,240
Name's Timothy White. He's a patient
in a psychiatric ward at the Duke Of
York Hospital, East Grinstead.

341
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,240
How did you get this footage?
Staff e-mailed it to the police.

342
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,040
But every police force is swamped
with mums and dads going absolutely
mental, so it's just waiting in line.

343
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,520
I reckon no-one else has
noticed him yet. East Grinstead.

344
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,200
That's what, two hours? I'm on it!

345
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,400
'I know I promised, shut up.
Change of plan.'

346
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:31,920
Oh, s'all right, I thought
you'd be busy. "We are coming!"

347
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,000
Eh, but what's it like?
The estate agent hasn't turned up.

348
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,520
Fair dos, she's probably got kids.
So, what do you think's causing it?

349
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,200
I can't say. Top secret.

350
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,440
You haven't got a clue, have you?
No idea.

351
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:47,600
Tell you what, it looks nice from
the outside. I reckon we could knock
ten grand off the asking price.

352
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,400
Three bedrooms.

353
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
One could be a nursery.

354
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,320
Oh, stop it! One day!

355
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,200
You can adopt a Filipino and get
her to clean the chimneys. I was
thinking though, right?

356
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,680
Those kids went off at 8.40, when
everyone's on their way to school,
then at 10.30, that's break time.

357
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,120
It's like it was timed.
So you'd get maximum kids out in
the open, visible to everyone.

358
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,240
Suppose. Yeah, but that means
it's timed around Britain.

359
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,960
Specific British hours, yeah?

360
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,920
It might be worldwide, but I reckon
someone's looking right at us.

361
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,040
That's brilliant. That is brilliant,
you're not bad, you, are you?

362
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,240
I'm bloody superb.
Oh, my God, Severn Bridge!

363
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,520
I'm going into England!
Farewell forever!

364
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,520
Good luck! Have you got currency?
Yes, and I've had my injections!
See ya!

365
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,520
Lunch time.

366
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,400
This place should be
buzzing with kids.

367
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,480
Everyone's taken them home.
We need a child.

368
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,520
Cos we need to test
those frequencies.

369
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,080
Find the right frequency, and we can
find out who's transmitting.

370
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,360
Where d'you get a child, though?

371
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,680
I could find you lasers and
weevils and hitchhikers.

372
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,360
But kids...

373
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,200
See you later.

374
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,480
Where are you going?

375
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,920
Now who's a couple?

376
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,120
When I was a kid, it was the bomb.

377
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,240
Iron Curtain. Reds under the bed.

378
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,080
It was all so bloody simple.

379
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,320
Now it comes raining
down from the skies.

380
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,960
Made of metal,

381
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,160
stinking green and God knows what.

382
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,120
I find myself running a
country under siege from above.

383
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,240
What d'you recommend that we do?

384
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:03,120
You tell me. Given that this
is now worldwide, Prime Minister,

385
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,040
it might be best if certain

386
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:09,880
historical events were taken
off the record.

387
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:12,800
So Britain gets a clean sheet?
Yes, sir.

388
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,200
How do we know if these...what do we
call them?

389
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,800
The 456. They never gave a name.

390
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,160
We just called them the 456
after the frequency allocation.

391
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,640
Then how do we know that the
456 will keep quiet? We don't.

392
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,520
All we can do is hope
to cover ourselves.

393
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,040
You'll have to issue a Blank Page.

394
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,120
No.

395
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,280
Then, what do we do?

396
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,640
I'm not having my name on this.

397
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:49,200
You never told me.
I was never a part of it.

398
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,200
I never knew.

399
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,480
Is that understood?

400
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,680
Yes, sir.

401
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,400
Then I take it that that

402
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,160
leaves the Blank Page with me?

403
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,280
Just don't tell me about it.

404
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,360
Tell her it's in the bottom drawer,
I put them there yesterday, yeah?

405
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:23,480
Oh, I thought so.

406
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:25,240
Good to see you.

407
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,600
How's things? Terrifying.

408
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,120
Uncle Jack!

409
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,360
Steven! Hey, soldier, how you doing?

410
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:35,400
I was talking like an alien!
Everyone was! It was brilliant!

411
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,520
You'd better come in.

412
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,120
CAR ALARM BEEPS

413
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,760
Only me. Oh, bloody hell.

414
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,440
We must be in trouble.

415
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,400
Or is it Christmas? How are they?

416
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,400
Yeah, it was a bit of a scare.

417
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,320
I brought them home, just in case.

418
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:02,040
I reckon it's that group hysteria
thing, like when lots of girls all
faint at the same time.

419
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,160
Did you say thanks to your uncle?
I did.

420
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,880
David! Your Uncle Ianto's here!

421
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,320
I was thinking.
I missed Mica's birthday.

422
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,560
I thought I could take her
to McDonald's.

423
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,440
That's all of £3.95, you big spender.

424
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,200
All right, cinema.
Yeah, that'd be nice.

425
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,320
You'd like that, wouldn't you, Mica?

426
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,960
I thought maybe this afternoon.
No chance. What about Saturday?

427
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:29,720
I'm kind of busy on Saturday. You're
a civil servant, they don't work
weekends. They invented weekends.

428
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:33,400
And I'm not having her going out, not
today, not with all that voice thing.

429
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,840
I want 'em where I can see them.
But she'll be with me.
She's staying put.

430
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,400
Right. Fine. Just an idea.

431
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,920
I won't bother you.

432
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,560
Oh, that's it, is it?
You're just gonna go now?

433
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:49,760
Oh, sit down, you daft sod. I've
got some of that spinach dip.

434
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:52,880
And you and me, well,

435
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,720
we've got things to talk about.

436
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,960
What things? You've been seen.

437
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,720
They said on the news that
we should send them back to school
tomorrow. D'you think it's safe?

438
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:06,000
Well, I don't know
any more than you.

439
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,600
Oh, come on.

440
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,240
I don't.

441
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,240
Any word from Joe?

442
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,760
In Italy.

443
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,560
With her.

444
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,640
They finally got married.

445
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,520
But he, er...

446
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,920
He phones every now and then,

447
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,360
and sends Steven postcards.

448
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
Remembers his birthday.

449
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,560
There are worse fathers.

450
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,320
How are you off for money?

451
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,720
Don't worry about that.
You give me enough.

452
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,560
Kind of easy, writing cheques, huh?

453
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,720
Alice, you're the one
who asked me to stay away.

454
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,040
I'd come round here every week,
if you wanted me to.

455
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,600
Every day.

456
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,240
Yeah.

457
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,160
I just can't stand it, Dad.

458
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:07,120
I look older than you do
and it's never gonna stop.

459
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:11,000
I get older and older
and you stay the same.

460
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:16,480
One day, you're gonna be
standing at my funeral.

461
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:20,400
Looking just like you did when
you were standing at Mum's.

462
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,760
No wonder she was so furious.
You make us feel old.

463
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:33,120
Actually, I found a grey hair.

464
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,720
Oh!

465
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,560
Well, that is the end of the world.

466
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,160
You ever gonna tell him?

467
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,040
What do I say?
That you're his grandfather?

468
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:55,120
He's too young to notice, right now.
That I don't age. But one day,
he's gonna realise.

469
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,400
And that's another reason
for you to stay away.

470
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,600
I suppose.

471
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,800
I could make the most of it while
he's still young. Take him out.

472
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:06,080
Buy him stuff.

473
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,880
Me and him, sort of thing.

474
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,160
You mean today?
While I'm here, may as well.

475
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:20,040
You bastard. Something happens
to kids, and you want to spend
time with him on the same day.

476
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:22,760
You are not experimenting
on that boy, Dad. Not ever.

477
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:26,320
That's why I want you to
stay away, because you're dangerous.

478
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,240
Dr Patanjali. You were paging me?

479
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,600
Rupesh! Captain Jack Harkness.

480
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:46,240
You've got a children's ward,
haven't you? I need a kid.

481
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:51,160
Susan on the corner was in town
and it was her anniversary,

482
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:55,720
so they went to that posh
French place by the memorial,
and there was you.

483
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,360
So...?

484
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:03,720
There was you, having dinner
with a man. So?

485
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,600
Having dinner, with a man,
in a restaurant.

486
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,120
So? You have dinner with Tina.
Not in town.

487
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,400
Susan said he was gorgeous.

488
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:16,160
Like a film star.

489
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,000
Like an escort.

490
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,520
He's my boss.
She said it was intimate.

491
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,840
I said, "Well, he's had girlfriends,"

492
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,320
and she said, "Well, no girl
was getting her feet round
that table, no chance."

493
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,960
Have you gone bender?
Mica's hearing this.

494
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:33,000
She's not bothered.
Her friend Sian's got two mothers.

495
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,920
Go on.

496
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,720
You never tell me
anything these days.

497
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:46,400
Dad died, that was it, you were off.

498
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,840
You couldn't wait.

499
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,520
Like I did something wrong.

500
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,920
I didn't, did I?

501
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,760
It's not that.

502
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:05,040
It's my job, it's difficult, it's...

503
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:15,440
He is very handsome. No!
Now stop it. You're kidding me!

504
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,040
Really, though?

505
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,080
Really?

506
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,240
Christ almighty!

507
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:27,280
He's nice, though? Is he?

508
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,520
Is he? Oh, my God.

509
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,680
I mean, since when?

510
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,840
It's weird,

511
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,080
it's just different.

512
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:41,600
It's not...men.

513
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,960
It's just him.

514
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,560
It's only him.

515
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,920
And I don't even
know what it is, really.

516
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,440
So... So I'm not broadcasting it.

517
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,440
Oh, no, honest, I won't say.

518
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:03,360
If you want it kept quiet, I swear,
I won't say a word, I promise.

519
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,960
Aye aye, gay boy, she says
you're taking it up the arse.

520
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,840
Mica, will you get off that thing.

521
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:14,480
Thanks. How've you been then,
you smart bastard?

522
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,200
CAR ALARM WAILS

523
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:20,120
Eh, whose car is that outside,
is that you? Black thing?

524
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,320
That's the company car. You want
to watch it on this estate, boy.

525
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:25,280
No, it's fine,
it's got a triple-deadlock.

526
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,400
Oh, aye, sounds like it.

527
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,720
CAR ALARM AND TYRES SCREECHING

528
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,160
Oh!

529
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:37,800
But it's got a triple
deadlock, they can't have!

530
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,520
They drive round the block, then
they come back for a lap of honour.

531
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,320
The victory parade!
We should phone the police.
It's more fun this way.

532
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:48,000
Right, here they come! Get ready!

533
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,280
Yay! David! Get inside! Now!

534
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,280
That's my car! I'm not telling
you again, get inside. I'll take
your computer off you, get in.

535
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,880
That's my car.

536
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:07,640
Timothy White. 52 years old.
He's been with us three months.

537
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:10,880
But he's got a history of being
in and out of care all his life.

538
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,800
Timothy White's.
My mum used to shop there.

539
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,880
If he's got a different name,
he's never said.

540
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:20,240
He spent 40 years living
in Leeds, that's where
he first came on record.

541
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,240
Found homeless, living on
the streets, at the age of 11.

542
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:25,360
11, bloody hell.

543
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,400
No-one ever reported him missing.

544
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,760
Apparently though, he did have
a Scottish accent, back then.

545
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:33,760
Gone now,

546
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,400
but he was a long way lost.

547
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,880
Can you remember the voice?

548
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,720
You said, "We are coming."

549
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,800
Can you remember why?

550
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,840
D'you know what I think it was?

551
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,160
Aliens.

552
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:05,280
There's no such thing.
Those days are gone.

553
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:13,880
I don't mean to scare you, because
you're perfectly safe, but I think
aliens are using you to speak.

554
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,960
What d'you think?

555
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:19,040
No such thing. Isn't it, isn't it?
I've met aliens.

556
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:22,000
It's part of my job.

557
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,480
But I'm not the authorities,
or the police, or the army.

558
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,800
So anything you say

559
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,960
is just between me and you.

560
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,000
And I will believe you.

561
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,360
Give me your hand.

562
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,680
You're telling the truth.

563
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,200
How can you tell? I can smell it.

564
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,600
You've...met them?

565
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,800
Dozens of them.

566
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,160
Still not safe.

567
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:12,040
Isn't it, isn't it?
They're watching.

568
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,600
Well, I can do something about that.

569
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,920
Shh, shh.

570
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,920
What's that thing?

571
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:39,000
The technical name is a gizmo.

572
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:46,480
HE LAUGHS

573
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,720
Isn't it?

574
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,600
I think you've seen aliens too.

575
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,680
What's your name?

576
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,840
What's your REAL name?

577
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,360
When did you last say your name?

578
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,400
Never. Then tell me. I was a kid.

579
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,760
What happened?

580
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:33,600
They took us out.

581
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:40,000
In the night. In the dark.

582
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,200
Isn't it? Isn't it?

583
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:46,200
They told us, they said we were
going to a new home.

584
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,360
Who did, who said?

585
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,560
The staff. A care home?

586
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,360
They drove us
away for miles and miles.

587
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:01,960
HIGH-PITCHED GIGGLING

588
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,960
They were there.

589
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,880
In the sky. What did they look like?

590
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,560
Light.

591
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:20,880
The light...

592
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:24,960
..took them.

593
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,840
Took who? My friends. But not you?

594
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,280
I ran.

595
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:42,160
There was something,
there was people, there was..

596
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,960
Isn't it, isn't it,
isn't it, isn't it?

597
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,440
You're all right,

598
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:51,960
you're safe. OK?

599
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,360
You're safe now.

600
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:56,120
But they're coming back.

601
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,000
I've been smelling them for months.

602
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:05,040
In the air.

603
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,360
Long time coming.

604
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:10,840
Tim, I can help. Look at me.

605
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,440
I can help.

606
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:17,200
If kids went missing, something's got
to be written down
and I will find it.

607
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:19,880
But to do that,
I need to know your name.

608
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,960
I was Clem.

609
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,760
Clement MacDonald.

610
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,200
Hi, Clem.

611
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,760
Hi.

612
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,680
Where were you from?

613
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,880
It was somewhere in Scotland,
do you remember?

614
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,560
Holly Tree. Holly Tree,
is that a town, or a place, or...?

615
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,520
The Holly Tree. Is that
where it happened? Clem?
What was the Holly Tree?

616
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:56,560
What was the Holly Tree?

617
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,160
You're pregnant.

618
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,240
Sorry?

619
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,240
Yes, you are. No, I don't think so.

620
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,480
Yes. I can smell it. Three weeks.

621
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:19,080
Oh... Bloody hell,
I've been running.

622
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:22,880
That camera's gone off,
it just went dead!

623
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:25,240
Still. No harm done, eh?

624
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,680
Everything all right?
Yes. I'm fine, thank you.

625
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,080
Right, well,
I think you've had long enough.

626
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:36,120
Time for your meds, isn't it, Tim?
If you don't mind. No.

627
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,040
Congratulations.

628
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:50,280
Ianto, I need a search on Clement
MacDonald, could be M-C or M-A-C,

629
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,480
and try the words "Holly Tree"
and Scotland. We're looking
at the 1960s, got that?

630
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:59,880
Yeah. Then try the words Timothy
White, with the option of Timothy
White's, apostrophe S, like the shop.

631
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,440
I lost the car.

632
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:06,200
Yeah, and if you find anything,
let me know, don't wait for
me to get back. Kids nicked it.

633
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,840
Yeah, I'll see you later.

634
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:18,280
I've got a red flag on a
Torchwood intercept, the name
Clement MacDonald, can you trace it?

635
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:22,040
Roger, Ashton, control
initiating trace now.

636
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,760
You'll find the names under 456.

637
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,720
And what d'you want me to do?

638
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:04,480
I promise, we can zap these kid's
memories so they won't remember,
no side effects.

639
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,280
There's been another death.

640
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,320
Mr Chow Lee Jee, Chinese again.

641
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,760
He came in with a nosebleed
that wouldn't stop.

642
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:16,480
Next thing you know, it's been
diagnosed as a brain haemorrhage,
he died at 16.25.

643
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,000
Sorry, he's with me.
Dr Patanjali, A&E.

644
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:25,080
We just need
to check Mr Chow Lee Jee.

645
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:28,360
Well, he hasn't gone missing.
I can see that.

646
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,120
Need to run a toxicology scan.

647
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:33,080
Not on the NHS,
we've got much better equipment.

648
00:48:33,080 --> 00:48:39,040
Pupil's blown, that corresponds
with a brain haemorrhage, though
it could be induced artificially.

649
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:42,000
No sign of trauma to the skin,
apart from bruising, but...

650
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,360
GUNSHOT

651
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,480
Get them in.

652
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,000
Seal off the area.

653
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,120
The name Clement MacDonald hasn't
been active for 44 years,
but here he is.

654
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:28,800
Torchwood's found him under
the name of Timothy White.

655
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:31,600
That's way beyond coincidence.
Bring him in.

656
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:47,560
Who changed the plan?
I spent months researching that.

657
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,920
And they believed me!

658
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:55,080
Perfect infiltration, I thought
you wanted me inside Torchwood to
see what they've got in there.

659
00:49:55,080 --> 00:49:56,920
Who killed the Chinese man?

660
00:49:56,920 --> 00:50:02,800
I did, I had to, it was perfect
timing, he just fitted the story.

661
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,440
Then get off your high horse, yeah?

662
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:07,440
Any sign yet?

663
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,120
Not so far.

664
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,520
D'you think it's true?

665
00:50:12,320 --> 00:50:13,760
What they say about him?

666
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,600
He was dead.

667
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,720
Now he's dead again. And we'll
keep killing him till he's ready.

668
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,360
Get him prepared. Yes, Ma'am.

669
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,080
How the hell does he do it?

670
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:35,800
No-one knows. Theory would suggest
it's connected to the Torchwood Hub.

671
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,560
That Rift thing.
Which makes the whole place a target.

672
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,920
What changed the orders?

673
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:42,880
The children.

674
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:36,440
Seal him up. Closing down.

675
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,200
Everybody out!

676
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:40,760
Put him back where he was.

677
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,480
He'll wonder where I've gone.
How do we cover that?

678
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,920
How d'you mean?

679
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,400
Well, he's gonna try and trace me.

680
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:58,520
You're not disappearing.
Yeah, but I've got to, he's gonna...

681
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,840
Sides!

682
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,040
Oh, no.

683
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:05,800
Result! There was a Holly Tree Lodge
just outside Arbroath.

684
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:10,640
It's a hotel now, but, up until
1965, it was a state-run orphanage.
And they had a Clement MacDonald!

685
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:14,280
He was taken into care,
April 1965, after his mother died.

686
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:20,160
No father on record.
In November 1965, he was
transferred, along with... Oh.

687
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,040
Over to control. Harkness now
approaching door one, over.

688
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:35,320
He's inside! We don't know how deep
that place goes. Give it five. Over.

689
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,200
We need damage control
at St Helen's. One body.

690
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:57,800
Dr Rupesh Patanjali.
Shot in the back. What happened?

691
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,560
I don't know. He was just
left there right beside me.

692
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:02,400
Like someone's gloating.

693
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,160
Did they kill you? Yeah.

694
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:13,360
Maybe we're being targeted.
Whether it was him or me, we should
be careful, better tell Gwen.

695
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,920
She's back, she's in the lab. Gwen!

696
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,960
Boy, have I had a day.

697
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,040
Oh, my God. Is that...?

698
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:35,920
How long? Three weeks.

699
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,440
That's good, isn't it?

700
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:48,320
From where I'm standing it...

701
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:50,080
looks good to me.

702
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,480
Yeah.

703
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:56,640
Bloody hell.

704
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,720
It's brilliant!

705
00:55:02,240 --> 00:55:05,200
Ianto! We're having a baby!

706
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,360
Have you told Rhys?
I've only just found out myself.

707
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:12,440
Oh, you told me before you
told him, he is gonna love that.

708
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:14,360
Congratulations.

709
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,000
Would now be a good time to tell
you I lost the car? You did what?!

710
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:22,160
That is so bloody spectacular!

711
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,880
But what about this place,
and my job?

712
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:28,520
We'll manage. We always do.

713
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:30,760
SIREN
What the hell is that?

714
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:35,360
Oh, my God.

715
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:39,800
There's a bomb,
there's a bomb inside your stomach.

716
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,920
Get out, both of you.

717
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:48,720
It has a blast radius of one mile!
Right now! Look there must be
something we can do. We can stop it.

718
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,360
We can fix this OK, we can rip it out
of you. I'm telling you. Get out!

719
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,240
It's active. Two minutes!
I can't just run, Jack.

720
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:56,920
You're pregnant.

721
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:04,480
We are coming.
We are coming. John! John!

722
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:09,080
We are coming. We are coming.

723
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:14,320
We are coming. We are coming.

724
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:19,880
We are coming. We are coming.
We are coming. We are coming.

725
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,240
Ianto, you're going to get
locked inside.

726
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,360
'Torchwood - lockdown.'

727
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:28,520
Ianto! We can override the
mechanism. For God's sake, get out!

728
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:32,000
There'll be nothing left of you!
I can survive anything.

729
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:40,720
RECORDED VOICE:
'Torchwood - lockdown.'

730
00:56:40,720 --> 00:56:43,120
'Torchwood - lockdown.'

731
00:56:43,120 --> 00:56:46,360
I'll come back. I always do.

732
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:50,600
Stop it, Stephen. Stop it.
We are coming. Stop it!

733
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,680
We are coming. We are coming.
We are coming. Stop it! Stop it!

734
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,080
We are coming. We are coming.

735
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,040
We are coming...back.

736
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:29,560
What's going on, like?

737
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:33,160
Someone is trying to kill me.
If they're after me,
they'll come after you.

738
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,720
Call me when you've got them.
And get them quick. Gwen!

739
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:42,600
It's all to do with aliens and
they'll be here tomorrow.
We are coming.

740
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:44,240
And why do they want you dead?

741
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:48,160
We're building something and we
don't even know what it is?
It's for them.
