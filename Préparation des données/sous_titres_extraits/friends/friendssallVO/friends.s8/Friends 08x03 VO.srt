1
00:00:03,292 --> 00:00:06,887
-Are you excited about our honeymoon?
-Yeah, l am.

2
00:00:07,132 --> 00:00:10,090
<i>Bermuda, Bahama</i>
<i>Come on, pretty mama</i>

3
00:00:10,332 --> 00:00:13,688
Get it out of your system
while we're alone.

4
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:17,641
-We came to say goodbye.
-Have a great honeymoon.

5
00:00:17,852 --> 00:00:19,570
-Thanks.
-l'll go pack.

6
00:00:19,772 --> 00:00:24,050
l already packed.
But l couldn't find your Speedo.

7
00:00:26,252 --> 00:00:29,961
Speedo? l don't have a Speedo.

8
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:34,490
l'm gonna go pack
my regular, long bathing suit.

9
00:00:36,092 --> 00:00:39,323
Good, you're still here!
Have a good honeymoon.

10
00:00:39,572 --> 00:00:41,324
Oh, thank you!

11
00:00:41,572 --> 00:00:45,645
And l wanted you guys to know
l am telling the father today.

12
00:00:49,852 --> 00:00:51,331
What? What? What?

13
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:56,163
-We know it's Ross.
-How? How do you know?

14
00:00:56,412 --> 00:01:00,041
lt was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

15
00:01:00,292 --> 00:01:03,568
l wanted Ross to know first.
But l'm relieved!

16
00:01:03,812 --> 00:01:07,441
-l'm gonna be your baby's aunt!
-l know.

17
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:12,362
-Me too!
-l'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

18
00:01:13,052 --> 00:01:17,728
-You'll all be aunts and uncles.
-But l'm the only one related by blood.

19
00:01:18,452 --> 00:01:23,731
Now that you all know, you can give
me advice on how to tell Ross.

20
00:01:23,932 --> 00:01:25,411
What'll you say?

21
00:01:25,612 --> 00:01:29,730
That l'm having it. And he can be
as involved as he wants.

22
00:01:29,932 --> 00:01:31,524
That sounds good.

23
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:36,442
Yeah, but how do l start?
What's the first thing that l say?

24
00:01:39,492 --> 00:01:42,723
-Okay, great. Thanks.
-Hey, good luck.

25
00:01:42,932 --> 00:01:45,127
Yeah, bye.

26
00:01:45,332 --> 00:01:46,765
What was that about?

27
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:51,528
No harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are having a baby.

28
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:57,523
What? l didn't even know!
Why didn't you tell me?

29
00:01:57,772 --> 00:02:00,650
Why am l talking like this?

30
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:05,041
l didn't think
you could keep it a secret.

31
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:08,364
l'm an excellent secret-keeper.
l've kept all our secrets.

32
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:11,200
-What secrets?
-No, no, Joey.

33
00:02:11,412 --> 00:02:16,042
l'm not gonna tell you because
l am an excellent secret-keeper.

34
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:21,449
-You'll tell me later?
-You already know.

35
00:02:22,732 --> 00:02:24,723
The One Where Rachel Tells Ross

36
00:03:02,012 --> 00:03:06,164
lt's so romantic to send people off
on their honeymoon.

37
00:03:06,412 --> 00:03:10,166
You know, they're married.
Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

38
00:03:10,412 --> 00:03:16,248
-Maybe you and l should do something.
-All in good time, my love.

39
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:21,883
l left my guitar in their apartment.
You can let me in, right?

40
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:24,447
They took my key to give to you.

41
00:03:24,652 --> 00:03:29,442
-What? They took mine to give to you.
-Why would they take our keys?

42
00:03:29,652 --> 00:03:34,043
-Maybe they don't trust us.
-They let me keep my key last time.

43
00:03:34,252 --> 00:03:39,246
When you broke the ketchup bottle
and cleaned it with Monica's towels?

44
00:03:39,452 --> 00:03:41,886
-l washed those.
-No, you didn't.

45
00:03:42,092 --> 00:03:44,481
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

46
00:03:45,132 --> 00:03:49,205
-l really need my guitar.
-l have stuff in there too.

47
00:03:49,412 --> 00:03:53,724
-What stuff?
-Monica's chicken parm. l'll fix it.

48
00:03:55,532 --> 00:04:01,641
Mr. Treeger? l need to get into
Monica's apartment. lt's an emergency!

49
00:04:01,852 --> 00:04:06,448
Gas leak.
Oh, and bring garlic bread.

50
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:12,320
-Did Rachel find you?
-No, why?

51
00:04:12,572 --> 00:04:17,441
-She was looking for you.
-l guess l'll catch up with her later.

52
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:23,645
-She really wanted to talk to you now.
-Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

53
00:04:25,052 --> 00:04:28,249
-Oh, no.
-What?

54
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:32,049
l think l might know
what this is about.

55
00:04:33,612 --> 00:04:34,840
Really?

56
00:04:35,052 --> 00:04:41,241
Yeah. We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody this. . .

57
00:04:41,492 --> 00:04:45,007
. . .but a month ago,
Rachel and l slept together.

58
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:47,569
And?

59
00:04:50,652 --> 00:04:56,648
-Wow, l thought you'd be more shocked.
-Oh, sorry. And?!

60
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:04,644
Well, we said we'd just
do it that one time. . .

61
00:05:04,892 --> 00:05:08,441
. . .but now l think she may
wanna start things up again.

62
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:11,962
Yeah, l don't think that's what it is.

63
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:17,240
-Why? What else could it be?
-Oh, wow, l don't feel well.

64
00:05:18,732 --> 00:05:22,407
l'm telling you,
that's what it is.

65
00:05:22,612 --> 00:05:26,241
No wonder she was looking
at me funny at the wedding.

66
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:28,887
She didn't say anything to you?

67
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:32,004
Maybe it's something you ate.

68
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:36,649
-Please, just go and talk to Rachel.
-Yeah, l guess l should.

69
00:05:38,492 --> 00:05:40,801
You know what l have to realize?

70
00:05:41,012 --> 00:05:45,847
l'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.

71
00:05:47,052 --> 00:05:51,648
They always seem to want
a little bit more.

72
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:55,041
l should remember that.

73
00:06:03,932 --> 00:06:05,843
Next.

74
00:06:06,292 --> 00:06:09,762
-They're kissing, let's go around.
-They're in love.

75
00:06:09,972 --> 00:06:13,203
l'm in love too.
But in an orderly fashion.

76
00:06:13,412 --> 00:06:18,884
-Next.
-Hi. Can you do that and walk?

77
00:06:19,132 --> 00:06:23,364
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.

78
00:06:23,572 --> 00:06:29,363
Let me see what l can do.
There are some first class seats.

79
00:06:29,572 --> 00:06:35,090
They bumped them up to first class!
Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.

80
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:37,647
We are on our honeymoon.

81
00:06:37,892 --> 00:06:41,521
-Grab my ass.
-Next.

82
00:06:41,732 --> 00:06:46,886
Sorry, l almost didn't hear you.
l'm so in love with my new husband.

83
00:06:47,092 --> 00:06:49,925
-We're on our honeymoon.
-Congratulations.

84
00:06:50,172 --> 00:06:55,041
Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

85
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:59,689
We're on our honeymoon, so can you
bump us up to first class?

86
00:06:59,932 --> 00:07:03,402
l'm sorry, that couple
got the last two seats.

87
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:09,130
lf we'd gone around them like l said,
she'd have given us those tickets!

88
00:07:09,372 --> 00:07:13,445
25J and K, any chance
those aren't together?

89
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:17,762
They took my key.
You trust me with yours.

90
00:07:17,972 --> 00:07:20,805
Of course, and l'll give it back. . .

91
00:07:21,012 --> 00:07:24,641
. . .when they're done
at the key shining place.

92
00:07:27,492 --> 00:07:29,960
What the hell is that?

93
00:07:30,812 --> 00:07:34,487
-What are you doing?
-You said there was a gas leak.

94
00:07:34,692 --> 00:07:39,368
-Why don't you use your key?
-l won't find it before it explodes.

95
00:07:39,612 --> 00:07:45,209
lf that happens at another building
l manage, people will ask questions.

96
00:07:47,732 --> 00:07:50,451
We could have done that.

97
00:07:52,732 --> 00:07:55,724
They're going into
the first class lounge.

98
00:07:55,932 --> 00:07:58,048
-You know what's in there?
-No.

99
00:07:58,292 --> 00:08:00,726
Me neither. We have to get in!

100
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:05,841
-Just act like you belong.
-Oh, my God! Oranges!

101
00:08:07,772 --> 00:08:12,641
-Nice to see you again.
-May l see your tickets, please?

102
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:14,444
Yes, of course.

103
00:08:15,612 --> 00:08:18,001
l can't see the seat number.

104
00:08:18,212 --> 00:08:21,887
That's all right.
l have it memorized. lt's 1 A.

105
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:27,486
-This isn't first class, sorry.
-Apology accepted.

106
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:32,243
Sir, l'm afraid l'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

107
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:34,364
Fine.

108
00:08:35,532 --> 00:08:38,251
Go, go, go!

109
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:57,089
l think there's something that
we really need to talk about.

110
00:08:57,332 --> 00:09:02,452
l think we do.
Why don't we go inside?

111
00:09:06,852 --> 00:09:11,289
-Look, l know why you're here.
-You do?

112
00:09:11,532 --> 00:09:18,051
Yeah, and to save you from any
embarrassment, l should talk first.

113
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:33,850
Ross and Rachel.
Rachel and Ross.

114
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:38,641
lt's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?

115
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:40,606
What?

116
00:09:41,292 --> 00:09:47,242
l mean, look, that one night we had
was fun and certainly passionate.

117
00:09:47,452 --> 00:09:52,242
But don't you think it's better
if we just stay friends?

118
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,923
Seriously, what?

119
00:09:56,252 --> 00:09:59,483
Okay, okay. You know what?

120
00:09:59,692 --> 00:10:04,846
lf you want to,
we can do it one more time.

121
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:11,485
l'd be okay with that.
ln fact, l have some time right now.

122
00:10:11,692 --> 00:10:15,844
-You know what? Can l talk now?
-Oh, sure.

123
00:10:21,692 --> 00:10:23,842
l'm pregnant.

124
00:10:27,732 --> 00:10:29,450
Ross?

125
00:10:33,732 --> 00:10:35,450
Ross?

126
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,885
Okay, whenever you're ready.

127
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:49,047
And you're the father, by the way.

128
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:04,490
-Can l get you some water?
-l'm good, l'm good.

129
00:11:04,692 --> 00:11:10,847
Ross, there is no pressure on you.
You can be as involved as you want.

130
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:20,247
Yeah, l. . . . l'm just, l don't know.
l don't understand. . .

131
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:24,041
. . .how this happened.

132
00:11:26,212 --> 00:11:29,249
-We used a condom.
-l know.

133
00:11:29,452 --> 00:11:34,287
But you know, condoms only work,
like, 97<i>°/°</i> of the time.

134
00:11:34,732 --> 00:11:36,643
What? What?

135
00:11:38,412 --> 00:11:40,448
What?!

136
00:11:41,132 --> 00:11:44,920
Well, they should put that on the box!

137
00:11:46,892 --> 00:11:50,931
-They do.
-No, they don't!

138
00:11:55,412 --> 00:11:59,405
Well, they should put it
in huge block letters!

139
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:05,005
-Let's just forget about the condoms.
-Well, l may as well have!

140
00:12:06,532 --> 00:12:12,880
-l was really freaked out too when--
-Freaked out? l'm not freaked out.

141
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:17,489
l'm indignant as a consumer!

142
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:21,401
-You know what? Let's talk later.
-No, l wanna talk now.

143
00:12:21,612 --> 00:12:28,165
ln fact, l wanna talk to
the president of the condom company.

144
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,250
Okay, maybe l should come back--

145
00:12:31,932 --> 00:12:34,651
Yeah, l'll press one!

146
00:12:37,932 --> 00:12:43,404
-l looked everywhere. No gas leak.
-So now l can heat this up?

147
00:12:43,932 --> 00:12:46,082
l'll get moving on that door.

148
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:51,047
Great. Could you not tell
Chandler and Monica about this?

149
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:54,568
They don't have any kids
of their own. . .

150
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:59,044
. . .and this door was
like a child to them.

151
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:02,961
l have to put in a new lock.
They'll find out anyway.

152
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:08,727
This looks like an all-day job.
l'll have to cancel my yoga class.

153
00:13:08,932 --> 00:13:12,242
Could you tell Jasmine
l can't make it to yoga?

154
00:13:12,452 --> 00:13:15,444
-Sure.
<i>-Namaste.</i>

155
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:22,844
-What happened to the door?
-So it's noticeable?

156
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:26,488
-ls Rachel here?
-Didn't you two already talk?

157
00:13:26,692 --> 00:13:28,842
Yeah, but. . . .

158
00:13:29,132 --> 00:13:34,843
You guys know Rachel and l slept
together, but there's something else.

159
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:37,811
Rachel's pregnant.

160
00:13:38,012 --> 00:13:41,288
-Holy mother of God!
-l can't believe it!

161
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:48,852
-With my child.
-That is brand-new information!

162
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,881
-You already know, don't you?
-A little bit.

163
00:13:56,132 --> 00:13:59,681
-How you doing?
-Okay. l mean, l'll be okay.

164
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:02,247
l didn't handle it well.

165
00:14:02,452 --> 00:14:04,488
-What'd you say?
-Nothing.

166
00:14:04,732 --> 00:14:09,248
But the complaint department
at the condom company got an earful.

167
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:12,330
Then when l turned around,
she was gone.

168
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:17,930
But in my defense, l found out
that condoms are only 97<i>°/°</i> effective.

169
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:20,692
-What?
-l gotta go find her.

170
00:14:20,892 --> 00:14:27,240
Hold on! Are you serious? So, like,
3<i>°/°</i> of the time they don't even work?

171
00:14:28,332 --> 00:14:31,802
They should put that on the box!

172
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:34,606
-Evidently, they do.
-What?!

173
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,727
-l can't believe we're here.
-You've gotta be kidding.

174
00:14:46,972 --> 00:14:48,530
What?

175
00:14:50,052 --> 00:14:53,931
As a wedding gift, we're
giving you the Honeymoon Suite.

176
00:14:54,132 --> 00:14:57,442
No! You have been screwing us all day!

177
00:14:57,732 --> 00:15:01,566
-Who are you?
-We're you. Just 1 0 seconds later!

178
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:06,886
You got first class, the lounge.
We need free stuff!

179
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:10,044
You're not the only ones
on your honeymoon!

180
00:15:11,132 --> 00:15:15,284
You can have the suite.
We don't care where we stay.

181
00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:22,051
We're here to celebrate our love.
We just want to be together.

182
00:15:24,612 --> 00:15:27,251
We need the stuff.

183
00:15:29,252 --> 00:15:33,006
Hey, it's Joey. We smell gas
from your apartment.

184
00:15:33,212 --> 00:15:38,081
-Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
-What else is new?

185
00:15:38,292 --> 00:15:42,888
-We'd check it, but you took our keys.
-Do something. Get in!

186
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:47,290
-How? l could break down your door.
<i>-Yeah, do that.</i>

187
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:51,445
-You won't blame us for any damage?
<i>-No.</i>

188
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:57,008
-Are you doing it? l can't hear.
-Okay, l'll break it down.

189
00:16:00,732 --> 00:16:04,611
He's doing it,
he's breaking down the door.

190
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:10,247
Okay, we're in.

191
00:16:13,412 --> 00:16:18,167
-Rachel, are you comfortable?
-lf l said l was, would you judge me?

192
00:16:18,652 --> 00:16:22,645
The doctor'll be here in a minute
to do your sonogram.

193
00:16:25,532 --> 00:16:30,242
Oh, man, l swear, if they sold
these at Pottery Barn. . . .

194
00:16:33,612 --> 00:16:35,204
We need to talk.

195
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:40,440
Right now? l kind of got an alfresco
situation going on over here.

196
00:16:40,652 --> 00:16:44,440
l want to apologize
for the way l acted earlier.

197
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:48,247
-Can you stay up near my head?
-Yeah, sorry.

198
00:16:48,452 --> 00:16:53,924
l went crazy. l was thinking about me,
and l should've thought of you--

199
00:16:54,132 --> 00:16:56,282
-Head, Ross! Head!
-Right.

200
00:16:56,492 --> 00:17:00,804
l want you to know that l'll be
there through this whole thing.

201
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:05,881
Doctor's appointments, Lamaze classes,
baby-proofing the apartment.

202
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:09,482
-We can do that after we get married.
-Married?

203
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:11,284
We should get married.

204
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:15,246
Because that's your answer
to everything?

205
00:17:16,372 --> 00:17:19,091
No, it's the right thing to do.

206
00:17:19,292 --> 00:17:24,650
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
But we are not in love, are we?

207
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:30,210
No, but still, l mean,
you can't possibly do this alone.

208
00:17:30,572 --> 00:17:31,846
Excuse me?

209
00:17:32,052 --> 00:17:36,603
Come on, you can't even eat alone
in a restaurant.

210
00:17:36,812 --> 00:17:41,249
-What?
-How can you have a baby by yourself?

211
00:17:41,452 --> 00:17:44,842
-l can too eat by myself!
-When have you ever?

212
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:49,489
When certain people leave the table
and l am not finished!

213
00:17:49,692 --> 00:17:53,002
Certain others take two hours
to eat soup!

214
00:17:53,212 --> 00:17:55,362
Please, you inhale your food.

215
00:17:55,572 --> 00:18:00,043
l grew up with Monica. lf you
didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

216
00:18:02,492 --> 00:18:03,925
Am l interrupting?

217
00:18:04,172 --> 00:18:07,562
No, Dr. Long, come in.
This is Ross, the father.

218
00:18:07,772 --> 00:18:11,651
But not the husband,
because she can do this alone.

219
00:18:11,892 --> 00:18:15,851
Nice to meet you.
l'll get started on this.

220
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:22,646
-Why can't you admit you need me?
-l need you to stay near my head!

221
00:18:23,732 --> 00:18:28,886
Okay. Everything looks good.
Here it is on the screen.

222
00:18:29,092 --> 00:18:31,811
There's your uterus. . .

223
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:35,891
. . .and right here is your baby.

224
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:39,846
Oh, my God.

225
00:18:40,412 --> 00:18:45,486
Wow! There it is, l see it.

226
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:49,480
Congratulations.
l'll give you two a minute.

227
00:18:49,732 --> 00:18:51,723
Thank you.

228
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:00,687
Pretty amazing, huh?

229
00:19:00,932 --> 00:19:04,049
l don't see it!

230
00:19:10,932 --> 00:19:15,084
-What? What?
-l can't see it.

231
00:19:15,332 --> 00:19:18,483
-You just said you did.
-l know, l lied.

232
00:19:18,732 --> 00:19:22,566
l didn't want her to think
l was a terrible mother.

233
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:28,483
Come here. Sure you can.
Come here. Look, it's right there.

234
00:19:33,852 --> 00:19:36,650
Oh, it's beautiful.

235
00:19:36,892 --> 00:19:39,645
l see it now.

236
00:19:40,412 --> 00:19:43,529
-Do you really?
-No, l don't see it!

237
00:19:43,772 --> 00:19:46,286
Come on. All right. Okay. Okay.

238
00:19:46,532 --> 00:19:52,243
You see this tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?

239
00:19:54,332 --> 00:19:56,402
Sweetie, that's it.

240
00:19:56,612 --> 00:20:01,447
That's it? Well, l saw that.

241
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:09,441
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

242
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:17,047
Wow, l can't believe that's our baby.

243
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:22,641
Yeah, that's our baby.

244
00:20:32,052 --> 00:20:35,089
-So how was the doctor?
-lt went great.

245
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:38,921
-Good.
-Show them the picture of your uterus.

246
00:20:44,452 --> 00:20:46,044
l don't see the baby.

247
00:20:46,252 --> 00:20:50,643
l couldn't see it either
at first. But it's right. . . .

248
00:20:51,332 --> 00:20:54,449
Ross, l lost it again.
