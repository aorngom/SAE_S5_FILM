1
00:00:02,521 --> 00:00:03,863
Erica, are you okay?

2
00:00:04,272 --> 00:00:05,353
-  Yeah, you know, maybe I ate too much.

3
00:00:05,619 --> 00:00:07,030
I keep getting these stomach-aches.

4
00:00:07,441 --> 00:00:09,051
They come and go like every few minutes.

5
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:12,634
-  Oh my God!

6
00:00:12,983 --> 00:00:14,871
-  Relax! We'll just get her some antacids.

7
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:18,894
-  She doesn't have a stomach-ache. She's in labor!

8
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:20,346
-  Oh my God!

9
00:00:20,607 --> 00:00:22,205
-  So if you think I didn't say goodbye to you...

10
00:00:22,712 --> 00:00:24,836
....because you don't mean as much
to me as everybody else...

11
00:00:25,285 --> 00:00:27,327
... you're wrong. It's because
you mean more to me.

12
00:00:28,568 --> 00:00:28,957
-  Rach!

13
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:30,770
-  What?!

14
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:54,994
Hey.

15
00:00:55,682 --> 00:00:57,112
-  Shh.. Go back to sleep.

16
00:00:58,354 --> 00:00:59,089
I have to go home.

17
00:01:01,383 --> 00:01:02,322
-  Oh. This was amazing.

18
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:05,154
-  It really was.

19
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,681
You've learned some new moves!

20
00:01:10,313 --> 00:01:11,600
-  Yeah, well, this guy at

21
00:01:12,005 --> 00:01:14,075
work gave me "Sex for Dummies" as a joke.

22
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:14,833
-  Ah.

23
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:17,009
-  Who's laughing now?
-  I know!

24
00:02:07,504 --> 00:02:10,306
-  Breathe, breathe, breathe...

25
00:02:12,771 --> 00:02:13,978
.. Good...

26
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,734
-  Next time, can I say breathe?

27
00:02:16,998 --> 00:02:17,919
-  No, last time
you said it like Dracula,

28
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:19,551
and it scared her!

29
00:02:21,605 --> 00:02:22,973
Can I get you anything? You want some more ice chips?

30
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:24,242
-  No, I'm okay.

31
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:25,453
-  Alright, I'll be right back.

32
00:02:28,002 --> 00:02:28,634
-  Where are you going?

33
00:02:30,145 --> 00:02:30,922
-  To use the bathroom.

34
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:32,275
- You can't leave me alone with her.

35
00:02:34,202 --> 00:02:34,205
What?

36
00:02:36,617 --> 00:02:40,180
-  This is exactly the kind of social situation that I am not comfortable with!

37
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:43,631
-  What kind of social situation are you comfortable with?

38
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,982
-  It's just that we've never spent any time,
you know, alone together.

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,596
-  You'll be fine.

40
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,258
Nah, you won't, but I'll be back in two minutes.

41
00:02:52,503 --> 00:02:53,276
-  Okay.

42
00:03:01,543 --> 00:03:04,244
-  So, ah... Any plans for the summer?

43
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,131
-  I don't know. Maybe church-camp?

44
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,027
-  Hah. May not wanna mention this.

45
00:03:20,465 --> 00:03:22,572
So, you ever wonder which is worse, you know;...

46
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:25,127
...going through labor or getting kicked in the nuts?...

47
00:03:27,721 --> 00:03:29,012
-  What?

48
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:30,476
-  Well, it's just interesting.

49
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:32,438
You know, because no one will ever know,

50
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:34,889
because no one can experience both.

51
00:03:39,939 --> 00:03:41,532
-  One of life's great, unanswerable questions.

52
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:48,018
I mean, who knows? Maybe there's something
even more painful than those things?

53
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:53,586
Like this..

54
00:04:00,906 --> 00:04:01,574
Morning.

55
00:04:01,818 --> 00:04:02,310
Hey!

56
00:04:02,801 --> 00:04:03,679
What's that?

57
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,938
-  It's my house-warming present for Monica and Chandler.

58
00:04:09,002 --> 00:04:10,187
-  It's a baby chick and duck!

59
00:04:11,107 --> 00:04:12,820
-  Uh-huh. And I named them Chick Jr. and Duck Jr.

60
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:15,730
-  I did not see that coming.

61
00:04:17,544 --> 00:04:18,662
-  Yeah, I figure they'll love it at the new house...

62
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:19,830
... you know? It has that big backyard...

63
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,352
...And then, when they get old,
they can go to that special farm...

64
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:24,367
...that Chandler took the other chick and duck to...

65
00:04:26,763 --> 00:04:27,301
Yes.

66
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,872
-  Yeah. It's a shame people can't visit there.

67
00:04:30,605 --> 00:04:31,785
-  That is the rule, though.

68
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,143
-  Guess what? You're almost an uncle!

69
00:04:39,101 --> 00:04:39,898
What?

70
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,852
-  Yeah, Erica went into labor last night...

71
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,585
... Monica and Chandler are at the hospital right now!

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,453
-  Oh my God!

73
00:04:43,797 --> 00:04:45,639
-  Yeah, and I have a definite feeling it's gonna be a girl.

74
00:04:46,146 --> 00:04:48,153
-  Phoebe, you were sure Ben was gonna be a girl.

75
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:50,009
-  Have you seen him throw a ball?

76
00:04:53,944 --> 00:04:54,491
-  Is Rachel here?

77
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:58,697
-  Uh, I think she's still asleep.
Hey, hey, how did it go with you guys last night?

78
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,163
She seemed pretty pissed at you.

79
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:03,554
-  Uh, we, y'know, we worked things out.

80
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,287
-  What's that smile? Did something happen with you two?

81
00:05:08,878 --> 00:05:10,365
-  Hey, I'm not one to kiss and tell...

82
00:05:11,496 --> 00:05:14,486
but I'm also not one to have sex
and shut up. We totally did it!

83
00:05:17,285 --> 00:05:18,202
-  Oh my God. You and Rachel?

84
00:05:19,057 --> 00:05:20,057
-  I know, it's pretty great.

85
00:05:20,466 --> 00:05:22,323
-  So what does that mean? Are you guys getting back together?

86
00:05:22,993 --> 00:05:25,818
-  Oh, I.. I don't know. We didn't really get to talk.

87
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:27,308
-  But do you wanna get back together?

88
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,590
-  I don't know.

89
00:05:30,297 --> 00:05:30,925
It was incredible...

90
00:05:32,068 --> 00:05:34,747
I mean, it just felt so right.
When I was holding her, I mean...

91
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,486
I never wanted to let her go.

92
00:05:40,275 --> 00:05:41,938
You know what? Yeah, I do. I wanna be together.

93
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,915
YAY!

94
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:45,007
Yay!

95
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,519
-  So, so is she still going to Paris?

96
00:05:48,946 --> 00:05:50,987
-  Wow, I hadn't thought of that. I hope not.

97
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,880
-  Oh, this is like the best day ever. Ever!

98
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,773
You guys might get back together,

99
00:05:56,242 --> 00:05:57,615
Monica and Chandler are getting their baby,

100
00:05:58,042 --> 00:05:59,511
there are chicks and ducks in the world again!

101
00:06:01,758 --> 00:06:02,979
Oh, I feel like I'm in a musical!

102
00:06:05,164 --> 00:06:10,656
"Daa - raa... When the sun comes up,
bright and beaming! And the moon comes..."

103
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,082
-  Morning!

104
00:06:12,284 --> 00:06:12,950
-  Guess we'll never know how it ends.

105
00:06:14,013 --> 00:06:14,422
-  Okay.

106
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:16,016
-  Hey.

107
00:06:16,527 --> 00:06:17,038
-  Hey.

108
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:18,403
-  Hey. How did you sleep?

109
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:19,680
-  Good. You?
-  Good.

110
00:06:20,557 --> 00:06:21,603
-  I bet you did!

111
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,236
-  Uh. Would you guys mind giving us a minute?

112
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:29,492
-  Sure, yeah. Will you just keep an eye on the chick and the duck?

113
00:06:30,299 --> 00:06:31,667
-  Chick and the duck? Didn't they die...

114
00:06:31,955 --> 00:06:32,606
-  Dive.

115
00:06:34,142 --> 00:06:37,251
Yeah, they dove head-first into fun on the farm.

116
00:06:45,443 --> 00:06:45,970
So...

117
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:50,189
Morning.

118
00:06:51,141 --> 00:06:51,757
-  You too. ..

119
00:06:53,363 --> 00:06:54,564
...Last night was just wonderful.

120
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,819
-  It really was.

121
00:06:57,426 --> 00:06:59,226
-  I woke up today with the biggest smile on my face.

122
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:00,540
-  I know, me too. It was...

123
00:07:01,945 --> 00:07:03,824
You know, it was like one of those things

124
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:06,404
you think is never gonna happen, and then it does...

125
00:07:07,264 --> 00:07:08,699
...and it's everything you want it to be.

126
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,941
-  Uh-huh. I know. It was just,

127
00:07:14,697 --> 00:07:16,005
it was just the perfect way to say goodbye.

128
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:26,436
-  It's just a little bit more, honey.

129
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,418
-  Help me! This hurts!

130
00:07:28,989 --> 00:07:29,805
-  Is it really that bad?

131
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,784
-  Uh-huh! I think it's time to kick you in the nuts and see which is worse!

132
00:07:36,461 --> 00:07:37,228
Doctor: The baby's head is crowning.

133
00:07:38,847 --> 00:07:39,549
-  Oh! Oh my God!

134
00:07:40,587 --> 00:07:42,989
That is the most beautiful top of a head I have ever seen!...

135
00:07:43,821 --> 00:07:44,681
... Chandler, you have to see this!

136
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,734
-  I'm okay.

137
00:07:48,627 --> 00:07:50,105
-  Chandler, you don't wanna miss this...

138
00:07:50,411 --> 00:07:52,510
.... This is the birth of your child! It's the miracle of life!

139
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:53,720
-  Alright.

140
00:07:56,748 --> 00:07:58,938
Wow, that is one disgusting miracle.

141
00:08:01,127 --> 00:08:04,210
Doctor: Start pushing. Here we go. Here come the shoulders...

142
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:12,439
-  It's a... It's a boy!

143
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:13,722
-  Wow!

144
00:08:14,193 --> 00:08:15,291
-  Is he okay?

145
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:16,658
Doctor: He's just fine.

146
00:08:17,551 --> 00:08:18,169
-  Oh, you did it!

147
00:08:19,784 --> 00:08:22,449
-  It's a baby! A beautiful little baby! ...

148
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:25,505
...And some other stuff I'm gonna pretend I don't see.

149
00:08:29,131 --> 00:08:30,193
Doctor: Would you like to cut the umbilical cord?

150
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:36,837
-  Well, that's spongy.

151
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:42,990
-  Oh, hey handsome!

152
00:08:45,075 --> 00:08:46,458
Oh, I'm gonna love you so much that...

153
00:08:46,824 --> 00:08:48,602
...no woman is ever gonna be good enough for you!...

154
00:08:52,168 --> 00:08:53,171
... Oh, we are so lucky!

155
00:08:53,437 --> 00:08:53,991
-  I know.

156
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,371
He has your eyes.

157
00:08:59,895 --> 00:09:02,548
-  I mean, I know that's not possible, but he does.

158
00:09:03,946 --> 00:09:04,497
Nurse: We'll just get him cleaned up a bit.

159
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,316
- Oh my God, he's beautiful...

160
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,104
...Thank you so much.

161
00:09:13,243 --> 00:09:14,346
-  I'm really happy for you guys.

162
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,302
-  How do you feel?

163
00:09:17,518 --> 00:09:18,253
-  I'm tired!

164
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:20,218
Doctor: Well, you don't have that much time to relax...

165
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,207
... The other one will be along in a minute.

166
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:30,668
-  I... I'm sorry, who should be along in a what now?

167
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,240
Doctor: The next baby should be along in a minute.

168
00:09:36,973 --> 00:09:37,973
-  We only ordered one!

169
00:09:40,332 --> 00:09:42,025
Doctor: You know it's twins, right?

170
00:09:42,572 --> 00:09:45,246
-  Oh, yeah! These are the faces of two people in the know!

171
00:09:51,861 --> 00:09:53,087
Doctor: I can't believe you didn't know it's twins!

172
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:55,206
This has never happened before.

173
00:09:55,706 --> 00:09:58,187
-  Well, gosh. That makes me feel so special and good.

174
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:01,044
-  (to the doctor) Wait, did you know it was twins?

175
00:10:01,496 --> 00:10:03,974
Doctor: Yeah, it's here in the paperwork we got from the clinic in Ohio.

176
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:05,520
-  (to Erica) Anybody tell you?

177
00:10:05,845 --> 00:10:06,584
-  I don't think so.

178
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:09,820
Although, they did mention something about two heartbeats.

179
00:10:10,438 --> 00:10:12,009
But I thought that was just mine and the baby's.

180
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,283
They kept saying both heartbeats are really strong...

181
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:16,364
...and I thought well, that's good 'cause I'm having a baby.

182
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,082
-  This is unbelievable.

183
00:10:20,716 --> 00:10:21,904
-  Twins actually run in my family.

184
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,329
-  Interesting!

185
00:10:25,355 --> 00:10:26,176
Can I see you for a second?

186
00:10:29,939 --> 00:10:30,576
-  What do we do?

187
00:10:31,209 --> 00:10:32,260
-  What do you mean "what do we do"?

188
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,946
Twins! Twins!!

189
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,858
-  Chandler, you're panicking!

190
00:10:38,327 --> 00:10:40,022
-  Uh-huh! Join me, won't you?! 

191
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,022
Okay, what do you say we keep one, and then just like have an option on the other one?

192
00:10:46,304 --> 00:10:47,516
-  We can't split them up!


193
00:10:47,838 --> 00:10:48,204
-  Why not? 

194
00:10:49,006 --> 00:10:50,474
We could give each of them half a 
medallion,

195
00:10:51,374 --> 00:10:53,462
 and then years later, they'll find each other 

196
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:57,491
and be reunited.

197
00:10:58,494 --> 00:11:00,097
 I mean, that's a great day for everybody.


198
00:11:01,469 --> 00:11:03,906
-  Okay, what if the person who adopts the other one is horrible?


199
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:07,060
-  What if they're not? What if it's adopted by a king?

200
00:11:07,552 --> 00:11:09,478
-  Yeah, because I hear the king is looking to adopt.

201
00:11:12,025 --> 00:11:13,980
-  Monica, we are not ready to have two babies!


202
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,154
-  That doesn't matter! 

203
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,317
We have waited so long for this. I don't care if it's two babies. 

204
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:20,669
I don't care if it's three babies! 

205
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:24,369
I don't care if the entire cast of 
"Eight is Enough" comes out of there! 

206
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,794
We are taking them home, because they are our children!


207
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,384
Okay. Shhh...

208
00:11:34,115 --> 00:11:34,794
Okay.

209
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:39,461
Doctor: It looks like we're about ready over here.


210
00:11:40,605 --> 00:11:41,796
Doctor: Come on, Erica, start pushing again now.


211
00:11:42,699 --> 00:11:43,706
Ow!

212
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,161
Here she comes!

213
00:11:46,161 --> 00:11:47,488
She? It's a girl?


214
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:48,785
Yeah.

215
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,619
-  Well, now we have one of each! 

216
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:55,842
And that's enough!

217
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:03,025
-  And then she said it was the perfect way to say goodbye.


218
00:12:04,246 --> 00:12:04,797
-  Oh my God! 

219
00:12:06,433 --> 00:12:06,977
What did you say?

220
00:12:07,525 --> 00:12:08,892
-  Nothing! What do you say to that?


221
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,589
-  Ross, you've got to tell her how you feel!


222
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:13,019
-  No way!


223
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:14,130
-  You can't just give up! 

224
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,347
Is that what a dinosaur would do?

225
00:12:18,604 --> 00:12:19,560
-  What?


226
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,174
-  Dude, I'm just trying to speak your language.


227
00:12:22,971 --> 00:12:25,174
-  Ross, Rachel doesn't know that you wanna get back together...

228
00:12:25,725 --> 00:12:28,651
...If she did, she might feel differently. She might not even go.

229
00:12:30,644 --> 00:12:31,051
-  You really think so?


230
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:32,277
-  I'm telling you! 

231
00:12:33,078 --> 00:12:36,732
Oh, okay! This is the part of the musical where there'd be a really good convincing song. 

232
00:12:37,489 --> 00:12:39,967
"Bam-bam, don't take no for an answer. Bam-bam,...

233
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,572
....don't let love fly away. Bam-bam-bam-bam..."

234
00:12:45,228 --> 00:12:45,660
Hi!


235
00:12:45,989 --> 00:12:47,197
-  Can't a girl finish a song around here?


236
00:12:47,232 --> 00:12:49,182
-  Hey!


237
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,063
-  Hi! So I just dropped Emma off at my mom's.


238
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:52,063
-  Okay.


239
00:12:52,331 --> 00:12:53,336
-  Oh, you're not taking her with you tonight?


240
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:55,685
-  No, we decided that I would go ahead and set up first, 

241
00:12:56,032 --> 00:12:57,745
and then my mom would bring Emma to Paris on Sunday.


242
00:12:58,214 --> 00:13:00,505
-  Wow, eight hour flight with a one-year old? Good luck, mom.


243
00:13:01,098 --> 00:13:01,576
-  Are you kidding? 

244
00:13:01,824 --> 00:13:04,158
Eight hours with my mother talking about Atkins? Good luck, Emma!


245
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:10,178
-  Alright, you know what? You're right. I should at least tell her how I feel.


246
00:13:11,949 --> 00:13:12,851
-  Ross, wait!

247
00:13:13,156 --> 00:13:13,972
-  What? What?

248
00:13:14,319 --> 00:13:15,133
-  Could you get me a muffin?

249
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,217
Gunther: Rachel?

250
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:21,230
-  Yeah?

251
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,733
Gunther: I... I know you're leaving tonight, 

252
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,368
...but I just have to tell you...

253
00:13:29,645 --> 00:13:30,300
...I love you.

254
00:13:34,131 --> 00:13:37,136
Gunther: I... I don't know if that changes your plans at all, but..

255
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:40,813
...I thought you should know.

256
00:13:42,715 --> 00:13:43,355
 Gunther... Oh...

257
00:13:46,697 --> 00:13:47,573
 I love you too. 

258
00:13:49,022 --> 00:13:50,109
Probably not in the same way,...

259
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:53,795
...but I do. And, 

260
00:13:54,453 --> 00:13:56,070
and when I'm in a café, having coffee, 

261
00:13:57,329 --> 00:13:59,513
or I see a man with hair brighter than the
sun,

262
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,632
 I'll think of you. Aw.

263
00:14:08,527 --> 00:14:10,926
-  Oh... Bye guys.


264
00:14:15,915 --> 00:14:16,551
-  Oh my God!


265
00:14:18,663 --> 00:14:19,654
-  Unbelievable!


266
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,194
-  Hey, you know what might help?


267
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:23,562
-  I'm not getting you a muffin!


268
00:14:34,603 --> 00:14:36,377
-  Do you think they recognize each other from in there?


269
00:14:37,766 --> 00:14:41,163
-  Maybe. Unless they're like two
 people who have lived in apartments...

270
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,388
...next to each other for years, 
and then one day ...

271
00:14:43,673 --> 00:14:45,509
they're pushed through a vagina and they meet.

272
00:14:47,532 --> 00:14:49,061
Nurse: We're going to take Erica to recovery now.

273
00:14:50,353 --> 00:14:51,061
-  There's something that we wanna tell you.

274
00:14:53,741 --> 00:14:56,089
 We decided to name the girl-baby Erica.


275
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:00,078
-  Oh my God, that's just like my name!


276
00:15:03,298 --> 00:15:04,256
-  Son of a gun, it is!


277
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:08,439
-  Anyway, I'm gonna go and get some rest.

278
00:15:10,754 --> 00:15:11,964
 I'm really glad I picked you guys. 

279
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,817
You're gonna make great parents.

280
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:16,805
 Even Chandler.


281
00:15:20,952 --> 00:15:21,974
-  Okay, well, bye!
-  Bye!

282
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,132
-  We'll call you!


283
00:15:23,421 --> 00:15:24,276
-  Okay.


284
00:15:24,436 --> 00:15:26,019
-  Have fun at church-camp!


285
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,181
-  Oh, look at these little bunnies!


286
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:34,126
-  I know! 

287
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,162
You ready to trade?

288
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:39,927
-  Okay.


289
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,297
-  Alright, let's see..


290
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:53,258
-  We could trade later.


291
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,301
-  Yeah, I'm good.


292
00:15:58,404 --> 00:15:59,146
-  Hey, what are you working on?


293
00:15:59,718 --> 00:16:02,216
-  It's a... It's a "welcome home" sign for the baby.


294
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:05,054
-  How sweet! Oh, is that the baby?


295
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:07,440
-  No, I sat in the paint.


296
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:10,754
-  Hey.


297
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,433
-  Hey. So, did you talk to Rachel?

298
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:14,971
-  No, and I'm not going to.


299
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:16,193
-  What?


300
00:16:16,438 --> 00:16:17,052
-  Why not?


301
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,343
-  Because she's just going to shoot me down. 

302
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,104
You guys saw what happened with Gunther.
 That did not look like fun.

303
00:16:21,921 --> 00:16:23,414
-  How can you compare yourself to Gunther?

304
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:26,709
 I mean, sure, he's sexy in a more obvious way. 

305
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:32,638
You have a relationship with her,
 you slept together last night.

306
00:16:33,124 --> 00:16:34,082
-  Yeah, and she still wants to go!

307
00:16:35,323 --> 00:16:36,611
 It's pretty clear where she is.

308
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:39,017
-  Yeah, I know what you mean. I mean, sometimes...


309
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:39,934
-  Uh, Joe?


310
00:16:40,179 --> 00:16:41,081
-  Damn it!


311
00:16:43,414 --> 00:16:45,247
-  Look, even if I were gonna tell her,
 I don't have to do it now. 

312
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,590
Okay? I'll be seeing her again. We've got time.


313
00:16:48,523 --> 00:16:50,645
-  No, you don't! She's going to Paris! 

314
00:16:51,175 --> 00:16:54,850
She is going to meet somebody. 
Do you know how many hot guys there are in Paris?

315
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:58,198
 It's... It's a city of Gunthers!


316
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:01,578
Mike: Hey!


317
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:03,685
-  Hey! What do you have there?


318
00:17:04,157 --> 00:17:06,479
Mike: Oh, I made a little something.
 If I had more time to work on it,


319
00:17:06,804 --> 00:17:07,863
 it'd be better, but..

320
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:11,831
-  Oh my God! You did that yourself?

321
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:13,832
-  Honey, that's gorgeous!


322
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:15,732
-  You know, the baby can't read, Mike!


323
00:17:19,465 --> 00:17:21,210
-  Hi! You guys, the car-service just got here. 

324
00:17:21,577 --> 00:17:22,579
I can't believe they're not home yet!

325
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:25,611
 I have to catch my stupid plane. I wanna see the baby!

326
00:17:26,224 --> 00:17:27,479
-  Monica just called from the cab. 

327
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:31,782
She said they should be here any minute.
 And apparently, there's some big surprise.


328
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,442
-  Yeah, did she sound happy about it? 

329
00:17:33,893 --> 00:17:36,801
'Cause my friend Ethel's baby 
was born with a teeny, tiny beard.

330
00:17:41,355 --> 00:17:42,840
-  Oh my God!


331
00:17:43,151 --> 00:17:44,324
-  Oh my God!


332
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:48,158
-  Hi! Oh my gosh!


333
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:50,053
-  Hey.


334
00:17:50,521 --> 00:17:51,192
Phoebe, Ross, -  Hey.


335
00:17:54,888 --> 00:17:56,361
Hey, so what is the big surprise?


336
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:00,918
Oh.

337
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,328
-  Oh my God!


338
00:18:03,611 --> 00:18:04,366
-  What... What...


339
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:07,230
-  Okay, okay, awkward question. The hospital knows you took two, right?


340
00:18:09,087 --> 00:18:09,850
-  Yes, it's twins!


341
00:18:10,577 --> 00:18:11,129
-  Oh my God.


342
00:18:11,373 --> 00:18:13,339
-  Oh, they're so cute! Now, what, what kinds are they?


343
00:18:14,155 --> 00:18:16,770
This is a boy, and that's a girl.


344
00:18:18,176 --> 00:18:19,017
-  Her name is Erica.


345
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:20,281
-  Aw..

346
00:18:20,508 --> 00:18:21,659
-  Hey, that pregnant girl's name was Erica.

347
00:18:23,334 --> 00:18:26,179
-  Yeah. It's a shame you
 two didn't get to spend more time together.

348
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,038
-  Yeah, we named the boy Jack after dad.

349
00:18:31,688 --> 00:18:32,585
-  Aw, he's gonna be so happy.


350
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:34,685
-  Oh, Jack Bing. I love that.

351
00:18:35,605 --> 00:18:37,451
 Ooh, it sounds like a '40s newspaper guy, you know? 

352
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,091
"Jack Bing, Morning Gazette. 
I'm gonna blow this story wide open!"

353
00:18:46,363 --> 00:18:49,900
-  Oh my gosh. Wow, so beautiful.


354
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:51,441
Mike: (To Phoebe) I want one.


355
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:52,581
-  Oh yeah? 

356
00:18:53,355 --> 00:18:55,378
Well, tell me which one, and I'll try slip it in my coat.


357
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:00,649
Mike: Seriously. Wanna make one of those?


358
00:19:00,995 --> 00:19:01,996
-  One? How about a whole bunch?


359
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,323
Mike: Really?


360
00:19:03,651 --> 00:19:05,298
-  Yeah! Ooh, we could teach them to sing, 

361
00:19:05,642 --> 00:19:07,090
....and we can be like the Von Trapp family! 

362
00:19:08,892 --> 00:19:11,475
Only without the Nazis. Although that sounds kinda dull.

363
00:19:13,876 --> 00:19:14,690
-  Oh, you guys, I can't believe this...

364
00:19:15,177 --> 00:19:16,211
... But I'll leave now, or I'm gonna miss my plane.


365
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:19,482
-  I'm just so glad you got to see the babies.


366
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:20,041
-  Me too. 

367
00:19:21,141 --> 00:19:24,824
Oh, I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be 
around to watch you two attempt to handle this!

368
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,152
 Alright, I can't say goodbye to you guys again...

369
00:19:31,622 --> 00:19:33,095
... I love you all so much.


370
00:19:33,962 --> 00:19:34,712
-  I love you.


371
00:19:35,037 --> 00:19:35,853
-  Call us when you get there.


372
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:37,051
-  I will. 


373
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,161
Ross, come here.

374
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,094
-  I just want you to know..

375
00:19:46,215 --> 00:19:47,313
... Last night.. 

376
00:19:49,694 --> 00:19:50,731
...I'll never forget it.

377
00:19:52,939 --> 00:19:53,778
-  Neither will I.


378
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:03,845
-  Alright, now I really have to go.


379
00:20:06,311 --> 00:20:08,000
 Okay. Au revoir! Oh, 

380
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:10,999
they're gonna really hate me over there.

381
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:15,811
-  So, you just let her go?


382
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:18,580
-  Yeah.


383
00:20:20,437 --> 00:20:21,129
-  Hey, maybe that's for the best.


384
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:22,979
-  Yeah?

385
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,710
-  Yeah. You know? You just... Look, you gotta... 

386
00:20:26,831 --> 00:20:29,292
You gotta think about last 
night the way she does, okay?

387
00:20:29,999 --> 00:20:30,508
 Maybe,

388
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,663
 maybe sleeping together 
was the perfect way to say goodbye?

389
00:20:36,866 --> 00:20:38,283
-  But now she'll never know how he feels!

390
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:40,244
-  Maybe that's okay. You know? 

391
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,396
...Maybe, maybe it is better this way?...

392
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:47,595
 I mean, now, now you can move on. ..

393
00:20:47,922 --> 00:20:52,268
...I mean, you've been trying to for so long,
 maybe now that you're on different continents.. 

394
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:54,820
Right?

395
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:01,337
-  Maybe now you 
can actually do it. You know? 


396
00:21:03,994 --> 00:21:05,086
You can finally get over her.

397
00:21:10,286 --> 00:21:11,067
-  Yeah, that's true.

398
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:14,611
.. Except 

399
00:21:17,598 --> 00:21:18,676
...I don't wanna get over her.

400
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:20,501
-  What?


401
00:21:20,811 --> 00:21:22,368
-  I don't! I wanna be with her.


402
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:23,555
-  Really?


403
00:21:23,738 --> 00:21:24,657
-  Yeah, I'm gonna go after her.


404
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:25,618
-  Yeah, you are!


405
00:21:26,373 --> 00:21:27,914
-  Woo!


406
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:30,315
-  Wait, wait! Get your coat! Get your coat!


407
00:21:31,135 --> 00:21:31,732
-  My coat...


408
00:21:32,078 --> 00:21:32,736
-  This is so cool!


409
00:21:33,284 --> 00:21:35,283
-  I have no idea what's going on, but I am excited!


410
00:21:36,891 --> 00:21:38,342
-  But Ross, Ross. What do you, what do you think she's going to say?


411
00:21:38,648 --> 00:21:41,491
-  I don't know, but I.. Look, 
even if she shoots me down, 

412
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:43,733
at least I won't spend the rest of my life wondering...

413
00:21:44,198 --> 00:21:45,719
...what would have happened. 
Where - where is my coat?!

414
00:21:46,696 --> 00:21:47,476
-  You didn't bring one!

415
00:21:48,877 --> 00:21:50,392
 My cab's downstairs, I'll drive you to the airport.


416
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:51,211
-  Okay, guys, wish me luck.


417
00:21:51,556 --> 00:21:52,089
-  Hurry!


418
00:21:52,738 --> 00:21:53,513
-  Good luck, good luck!


419
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,662
-  There's no seatbelt!


420
00:22:05,944 --> 00:22:07,102
-  That's okay. If - if we hit anything,...

421
00:22:07,346 --> 00:22:10,929
... the engine will explode, so you know, 
it's better if you're thrown from the car.


422
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:14,073
-  Alright, alright, let's do this!


423
00:22:14,478 --> 00:22:15,062
-  Okay!


424
00:22:17,474 --> 00:22:17,719
-  Hey!


425
00:22:17,965 --> 00:22:18,741
Man: 18th and East End.


426
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:19,759
-  I - I don't take passengers.


427
00:22:20,225 --> 00:22:22,014
Man: Hey! The law says you have to accept any fare.


428
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:24,102
-  No, you don't understand. This isn't a real cab.


429
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:26,513
Man: Alright, I gotta report you. What's your medallion number?


430
00:22:26,862 --> 00:22:28,632
-  My medallion number is, "Get out of the cab!"


431
00:22:30,012 --> 00:22:30,337
Man: What?


432
00:22:30,618 --> 00:22:31,718
Get out of the cab!


433
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,735
-  Get out of the cab!


434
00:22:38,987 --> 00:22:41,808
-  Oh, hey, hey, can I give you guys your house-warming present now?

435
00:22:42,113 --> 00:22:42,932
-  Now, that you can do.


436
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:43,731
-  Alright!


437
00:22:53,982 --> 00:22:57,852
-  Ah... Chick Jr.? Duck Jr.?

438
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:01,669
Don't hide from mama!

439
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,914
-  You can open your eyes now.


440
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:13,220
-  Are we off the bridge?


441
00:23:13,907 --> 00:23:14,501
-  Yes.


442
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:16,571
-  Is the old woman on the bicycle still alive?


443
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:18,672
-  Yes, she jumped right back up.


444
00:23:21,019 --> 00:23:22,603
-  Oh my God, Phoebe, slow down!

445
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,495
-  Do you wanna get to Rachel in time?


446
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:26,507
-  Yes, but I don't wanna die in your cab!


447
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,061
-  You should have thought of that before you got in!


448
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:31,810
-  Toll-booth.


449
00:23:32,464 --> 00:23:32,708
-  What?


450
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,663
Toll-booth! 


451
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:37,596
Four bucks. There are quarters
 in the glove compartment.

452
00:23:40,535 --> 00:23:40,968
-  Hurry!

453
00:23:41,313 --> 00:23:42,561
-  Okay!


454
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:43,880
-  Okay.


455
00:23:46,504 --> 00:23:47,652
-  Damn, that window is clean.


456
00:24:01,212 --> 00:24:02,795
-  We were wondering 
what was taking so long with the gift, 

457
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:05,512
but now we understand you were doing this.

458
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:10,592
-  Okay, I wanted to surprise you, but

459
00:24:12,229 --> 00:24:15,390
for your house-warming gift, 
I got you a baby-chick and a baby-duck!

460
00:24:17,298 --> 00:24:18,495
-  Really? You got us a chick and a duck?


461
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,465
-  Oh, great! Just what you 
want for a new house with infants. 

462
00:24:23,055 --> 00:24:23,997
Bird feces.

463
00:24:25,861 --> 00:24:27,654
-  Yeah, yeah, they must have jumped off the table, 'cause now they're gone!


464
00:24:28,038 --> 00:24:28,941
-  Oh, don't worry, we'll find them.


465
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,767
- Actually, I'm gonna go check on the twins.
- Alright.


466
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,867
-  Oh God! What did I just step on?


467
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,012
-  It's okay, it's just an egg roll.


468
00:24:37,687 --> 00:24:38,568
-  Oh..


469
00:24:38,816 --> 00:24:40,295
-  You stepped on my egg roll?


470
00:24:42,094 --> 00:24:44,564
-  I'm sorry, I didn't know to look for Chinese food on the floor.


471
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,148
-  Just put it on a plate and leave.


472
00:24:52,095 --> 00:24:53,941
-  Okay, let's find these birds.


473
00:24:57,604 --> 00:24:59,329
-  Wait, wait. Do you hear that?


474
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:04,413
-  Oh! They're in the table!


475
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:06,756
-  Well, that can't be good!


476
00:25:07,245 --> 00:25:08,432
-  We gotta get them out of there!


477
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:09,416
-  How?


478
00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:12,240
-  Oh, oh! Maybe we can lure 
them out. You know any birdcalls?

479
00:25:12,588 --> 00:25:13,969
-  Oh, tons, I'm quite the woodsman.

480
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:18,825
-  Well, maybe we can just tip the table a little.

481
00:25:19,925 --> 00:25:20,250
-  Joey, wait!

482
00:25:20,556 --> 00:25:20,800
 The ball!

483
00:25:21,331 --> 00:25:21,453
-  Oh!


484
00:25:34,684 --> 00:25:35,306
-  Oh God!

485
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:39,590
 So what do we do?

486
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:42,095
-  I don't know. Maybe we can open this up somehow.


487
00:25:47,068 --> 00:25:47,965
-  No... It's all glued together.


488
00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:51,212
-  Does that mean we have to bust it open?


489
00:25:52,624 --> 00:25:53,872
-  I don't know. Maybe.


490
00:25:54,949 --> 00:25:55,727
-  Oh my God!


491
00:25:57,614 --> 00:26:00,033
-  I know! It's.. It's the foosball table.


492
00:26:03,509 --> 00:26:04,679
-  All right, you know what? 
We don't have a choice. 

493
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:07,721
It's like I would have said in 
that sci-fi movie if I'd gotten the part.

494
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,627
 "Those are our men in there, we have to get them out! 

495
00:26:14,705 --> 00:26:16,922
Even if I have to sacrifice the most 
important thing in my life...

496
00:26:18,183 --> 00:26:18,988
... my time-machine."


497
00:26:21,601 --> 00:26:22,316
-  Did that movie ever get made?


498
00:26:22,619 --> 00:26:23,738
-  It did not.


499
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,535
-  Ross, where are you going?

500
00:26:32,902 --> 00:26:35,875
-  To talk to Rachel, isn't that why we took a ride in the death-cab?


501
00:26:37,258 --> 00:26:38,828
-  What? What are you just gonna walk up to her at the gate?

502
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:41,083
 Have you never chased anyone through the airport before?


503
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:43,246
-  Not since my cop-show got cancelled.


504
00:26:45,512 --> 00:26:47,204
-  You have to get a ticket to get past security.


505
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:48,819
-  What? We're never gonna make it!


506
00:26:49,205 --> 00:26:50,988
-  Not with that attitude! Now, haul ass!


507
00:26:54,435 --> 00:26:56,832
-  Okay, if you could all walk slower, that'd be great. 


508
00:27:05,327 --> 00:27:06,966
Madame, your passport please?


509
00:27:07,511 --> 00:27:08,293
-  Oh my God!

510
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:11,500
 I was so afraid I wasn't gonna 
remember any of my high-school French,

511
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:13,746
 but I understood every word you just said!

512
00:27:15,487 --> 00:27:16,264
Your boarding pass, please.


513
00:27:16,834 --> 00:27:17,676
-  Oh.


514
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:22,002
-  Oh, shoot. I had it. Oh, 


515
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,286
I can't believe this.

516
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:26,118
Madame, if you don't have your boarding pass...


517
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:27,002
-  I have it, I have it, I have it. 


518
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:34,076
Oh, okay, I can't find it, but I remember that I was in seat 32C, 

519
00:27:35,348 --> 00:27:36,584
because that's my bra-size.

520
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,212
Madame, you must have your boarding pass..


521
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:41,621
-  Okay, fine! But you know what?


522
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:43,720
 If I was in 36D, we would not be having this problem.

523
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:52,814
-  Hey, I need a ticket.


524
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:54,313
-  Just one?


525
00:27:54,679 --> 00:27:56,535
I drive you all the way down here, 
and I don't get to see how it works out?

526
00:27:57,538 --> 00:27:58,907
-  Fine, two tickets, I need two tickets.


527
00:28:00,023 --> 00:28:00,928
-  We're on our honeymoon.


528
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:04,111
 And the destination?


529
00:28:04,357 --> 00:28:05,745
-  I don't care. Whatever is the cheapest.


530
00:28:07,327 --> 00:28:08,242
-  I'm so lucky I married you.


531
00:28:11,946 --> 00:28:14,314
-  Oh! Shoot! Damn it! Where is it? 


532
00:28:15,968 --> 00:28:17,299
Oh! Oh! I found it! I found it!

533
00:28:17,604 --> 00:28:20,406
-  Hah! I found it! 
I told you I would find it! In your face! 

534
00:28:21,037 --> 00:28:21,919
You're a different person. 

535
00:28:26,228 --> 00:28:28,371
-  Okay, flight 421 to Paris.


536
00:28:30,914 --> 00:28:31,567
I don't see it, do you see it?

537
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:32,966
-  No, did we miss it?


538
00:28:33,414 --> 00:28:35,479
-  No, no, no. That's impossible. It doesn't leave for another 20 minutes.


539
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:38,899
-  Maybe we have the flight-number wrong. God.


540
00:28:43,793 --> 00:28:44,323
-  Hello.


541
00:28:44,629 --> 00:28:45,612
-  Hey, it's me. Here's Ross.


542
00:28:48,114 --> 00:28:49,361
-  What? Hey, hey, listen..


543
00:28:50,033 --> 00:28:53,041
-  Oh my God! Ross, you wouldn't believe the cute little noises the twins are making. Listen.


544
00:28:54,042 --> 00:28:54,805
-  Monica? 

545
00:28:56,493 --> 00:29:00,682
Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?

546
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:03,385
-  Oh, I'm sorry. Shoot, they were doing it before.


547
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:04,171
-  That's alright. Listen, listen.


548
00:29:04,416 --> 00:29:05,742
-  Oh, wait, wait, wait! Here they go again.


549
00:29:07,569 --> 00:29:10,708
-  Monica? Monica, Monica, Monica, Monica..?


550
00:29:12,181 --> 00:29:12,881
-  Isn't that cute?


551
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:13,935
-  That is precious!


552
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,123
 Listen! I need Rachel's flight information.

553
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:23,464
-  Oh, okay. Alright, it's flight 421. Leaves at 8:40.


554
00:29:24,126 --> 00:29:25,518
-  Yes, that's what I have. It's not on the board.


555
00:29:26,129 --> 00:29:28,263
-  That's what it says here. Flight 421, leaves at 8:40,


556
00:29:28,897 --> 00:29:29,834
 Newark airport.

557
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:31,062
-  What?


558
00:29:31,246 --> 00:29:33,866
-  Newark airport. Why, where are you?


559
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:36,539
-  JFK.


560
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:08,400
Don't worry, you guys, we're gonna get you out of there.


561
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:13,125
-  And we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.


562
00:30:21,257 --> 00:30:22,363
-  Okay. Here goes.


563
00:30:28,085 --> 00:30:28,848
-  What's the matter?


564
00:30:30,751 --> 00:30:32,444
-  I need to say goodbye to the table first.


565
00:30:35,564 --> 00:30:36,181
-  I understand.


566
00:30:42,142 --> 00:30:42,947
-  Okay. 


567
00:30:43,254 --> 00:30:43,933
Table, 

568
00:30:47,498 --> 00:30:50,423
you have given us so many great times. 

569
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:59,443
And you guys, Jordan, Victor, Joel... All of you guys. 

570
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:03,233
What can I say? You guys...

571
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,956
...make us look good. 

572
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:12,279
You wanna say anything?

573
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:13,653
-  I don't know.

574
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:19,439
 Except that, for one last time... 


575
00:31:21,108 --> 00:31:24,575
Good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game, good game.

576
00:31:33,176 --> 00:31:33,804
-  Okay, here we go.


577
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:43,804
 I can't do it.

578
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:46,603
-  Well, I can't do it either.


579
00:31:48,684 --> 00:31:49,579
-  Hey! Did you find them?


580
00:31:49,827 --> 00:31:51,470
-  Yeah, they're stuck inside the table!


581
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,758
-  We have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!


582
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:57,980
-  Oh, well sure. This gotta be so hard.


583
00:31:59,913 --> 00:32:00,629
I'll do it. Gimme!

584
00:32:07,314 --> 00:32:09,550
-  Phoebe! Wow! No, no, no!


585
00:32:12,783 --> 00:32:14,342
-  Well, I've never gone this fast before.


586
00:32:15,465 --> 00:32:18,361
-  Phoebe, forget it, okay? Newark is - is like an hour away.

587
00:32:18,705 --> 00:32:19,894
...There's no way we're gonna make it in time.


588
00:32:20,894 --> 00:32:22,113
-  She's got her cell, you could call her.


589
00:32:22,826 --> 00:32:24,149
-  I am not doing this over the phone.


590
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:25,842
-  You don't have any other choice!


591
00:32:33,413 --> 00:32:34,272
-  Hello?


592
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:37,684
-  Rachel? Oh, good. Hey, by the way, did you just get on the plane?


593
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:38,991
-  Yeah.


594
00:32:39,217 --> 00:32:41,227
-  (To Ross) For what it's worth, we would have caught her if we were at the right airport.


595
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:42,536
-  Yay.


596
00:32:44,961 --> 00:32:45,636
-  Uh, Rach, hang on.


597
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:49,937
-  Phoebe? Is everything okay?


598
00:32:54,524 --> 00:32:55,988
-  Uhm, actually no. No, you've... 


599
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,423
You have to get off the plane.

600
00:32:57,827 --> 00:32:58,499
-  What? Why?


601
00:32:59,283 --> 00:33:00,796
-  I have this feeling that something's wrong with it.


602
00:33:01,554 --> 00:33:04,796
... Something is wrong with the left Philange.

603
00:33:07,742 --> 00:33:09,897
-  Oh, honey, I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the plane.


604
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:14,438
-  Alright, look, I have to go. I love you, and I will call you the minute I get to Paris.


605
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:19,083
 Uhm, what was that?

606
00:33:20,942 --> 00:33:23,104
-  Oh, that was just my crazy friend. 
She told me I should get off the plane, 

607
00:33:23,816 --> 00:33:25,326
because she had a feeling that ...


608
00:33:25,568 --> 00:33:27,947
...there was something wrong with the left Philange.

609
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:31,486
Okay, that doesn't sound good.


610
00:33:32,945 --> 00:33:33,514
-  I wouldn't worry about it. 

611
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,904
She's always coming up with stuff like this,

612
00:33:35,209 --> 00:33:36,114
 and you know what? She's almost never right.

613
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:37,461
 But she is sometimes.


614
00:33:38,332 --> 00:33:39,106
-  Well...


615
00:33:42,125 --> 00:33:42,680
-  Wait, what are you doing?


616
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:43,689
 Well, I can't take this plane now.


617
00:33:44,094 --> 00:33:45,515
Excuse me, sir, where are you going?


618
00:33:45,861 --> 00:33:49,550
I have to get off this plane, okay? Her friend has a feeling..


619
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:51,490
...something's wrong with the left Philange.

620
00:33:56,248 --> 00:33:57,185
-  Could I get some peanuts?


621
00:33:59,346 --> 00:33:59,922
What's wrong with the plane?


622
00:34:00,369 --> 00:34:01,510
There's nothing wrong with the plane.


623
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:03,624
Yeah! The left Philange!


624
00:34:03,967 --> 00:34:05,172
There is no Philange!


625
00:34:05,637 --> 00:34:07,653
- Oh my God. This plane doesn't even have a Philange!


626
00:34:09,873 --> 00:34:10,423
- I'm not flying on it!


627
00:34:10,950 --> 00:34:11,543
- Ma'am, please sit down!


628
00:34:11,788 --> 00:34:12,428
- What's going on?


629
00:34:12,837 --> 00:34:14,693
- We're all getting off. There is no Philange!


630
00:34:20,403 --> 00:34:22,074
- This is ridiculous! I...

631
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:25,577
-  Yeah, okay.


632
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,049
-  Alright. My job here is done.


633
00:34:39,262 --> 00:34:40,956
-  That was... Impressive.


634
00:34:43,193 --> 00:34:44,393
-  Yeah, you didn't even use the tools for most of it!


635
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,351
-  Yeah, they were just slowing me down. 

636
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:52,435
Alright, I have to get back to the babies. I'll see you girls later.


637
00:34:57,556 --> 00:34:58,432
-  Sorry about the table, man.


638
00:34:59,672 --> 00:35:00,328
-  Yeah.


639
00:35:01,305 --> 00:35:01,874
-  You gonna buy a new one?


640
00:35:03,915 --> 00:35:04,447
-  Probably not. 


641
00:35:05,649 --> 00:35:08,051
...Nah. I don't know how much I'm gonna wanna play after you go.

642
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:14,821
-  Well, at least we got these little guys out.


643
00:35:16,191 --> 00:35:16,662
-  Yeah.


644
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:17,967
-  Aww, we were worried about you!

645
00:35:23,281 --> 00:35:26,192
...Hm. I guess I better get used to things crapping in my hand, huh?

646
00:35:36,617 --> 00:35:37,284
-  I'm gonna miss these little guys. 

647
00:35:38,933 --> 00:35:39,996
It was nice having birds around again.


648
00:35:42,628 --> 00:35:43,263
-  Hey, you know what? 


649
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:45,135
Maybe we should keep them here with you.

650
00:35:46,648 --> 00:35:47,097
-  What?


651
00:35:47,686 --> 00:35:49,111
-  Yeah, I mean we've got a lot going on right now.


652
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:51,366
And, plus, here they'd have their own room.

653
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,813
-  I could get a goose!


654
00:35:58,232 --> 00:36:00,035
-  You know, I - I think you're set with the poultry.


655
00:36:03,415 --> 00:36:04,292
-  Thanks man. 

656
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:05,662
Did you hear that, you guys? 

657
00:36:05,946 --> 00:36:06,819
You're gonna get to stay here!

658
00:36:07,745 --> 00:36:09,565
 And, and it's good, 

659
00:36:10,629 --> 00:36:11,323
you know, 'cause, 

660
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:14,808
'cause now you have a reason to come visit.

661
00:36:18,943 --> 00:36:20,550
-  I think there may be another reason. 

662
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:30,695
So...

663
00:36:33,722 --> 00:36:34,418
awkward hug or..


664
00:36:35,811 --> 00:36:36,909
...lame cool guy handshake?

665
00:36:40,128 --> 00:36:42,287
-  Uh, lame cool guy handshake, yeah.


666
00:37:01,244 --> 00:37:03,086
- Ma'am, I assure you, the plane is fine.


667
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,187
- And you fixed the Philange?


668
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:08,666
- Yes, the Philange is fixed. 

669
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:10,298
As a matter of fact...

670
00:37:10,523 --> 00:37:12,511
...we put a whole lot of extra Philanges onboard, just in case.


671
00:37:19,694 --> 00:37:20,246
-  Where is she?


672
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:21,021
-  I don't see her.


673
00:37:21,224 --> 00:37:22,185
-  Rachel! Rachel Green!


674
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:23,253
-  There she is!


675
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:25,011
-  Rachel! Rachel!


676
00:37:27,159 --> 00:37:28,520
- Wow, excuse me, sir, do you have a boarding pass?


677
00:37:29,218 --> 00:37:30,138
-  No, no, I just have to talk to someone.


678
00:37:30,402 --> 00:37:32,346
- I'm sorry, you cannot go any further without a boarding pass.


679
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:33,380
-  No, no, no, but...


680
00:37:33,625 --> 00:37:35,766
- RACHEL!!


681
00:37:39,745 --> 00:37:41,096
-  Oh my God... What.. What are you guys doing here?


682
00:37:43,226 --> 00:37:43,982
-  Okay, you're on.


683
00:37:44,736 --> 00:37:46,391
-  What? What? Ross, you're scaring me. What's going on?


684
00:37:48,702 --> 00:37:49,502
-  Okay, the thing is..


685
00:37:50,384 --> 00:37:50,955
-  Yeah?


686
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:52,461
-  Don't go.


687
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,814
-  What?


688
00:37:54,185 --> 00:37:58,171
-  Please, please stay with me. I am so in love with you. Please, don't go.


689
00:38:00,428 --> 00:38:01,564
-  Oh my God.


690
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,768
-  I know, I know. I shouldn't have waited 'till now to say it, but I'm..

691
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:08,324
...That was stupid, okay? I'm sorry, but I'm telling you now.

692
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:12,579
... I love you. Do not get on this plane.

693
00:38:14,218 --> 00:38:15,940
- Miss? Are you boarding the plane?


694
00:38:17,271 --> 00:38:19,966
-  Hey, hey. I know you love me.

695
00:38:21,778 --> 00:38:22,365
... I know you do.

696
00:38:23,791 --> 00:38:25,304
 - Miss?

697
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:28,322
-  I - I have to get on the plane.


698
00:38:28,849 --> 00:38:29,463
-  No, you don't.


699
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:30,276
-  Yes, I do.


700
00:38:30,479 --> 00:38:31,071
-  No, you don't.


701
00:38:31,297 --> 00:38:32,017
-  They're waiting for me, Ross.

702
00:38:33,143 --> 00:38:35,884
 I can't do this right now, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

703
00:38:36,847 --> 00:38:37,340
-  Rachel?


704
00:38:39,278 --> 00:38:39,818
-  I'm so sorry.


705
00:38:55,766 --> 00:38:57,560
-  I really thought she'd stay.


706
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:00,999
-  I'm sorry.


707
00:39:16,781 --> 00:39:17,564
-  Well, that's it.

708
00:39:18,908 --> 00:39:20,577
 Everything's packed.

709
00:39:23,315 --> 00:39:25,189
-  Wow, this is weird.


710
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:26,950
-  I know.


711
00:39:28,602 --> 00:39:30,554
-  Yeah. Uh, does this mean there's nothing to eat?


712
00:39:34,018 --> 00:39:34,855
-  I put three lasagnas in your freezer.


713
00:39:37,023 --> 00:39:37,879
-  I love you!


714
00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:42,545
-  Hey!


715
00:39:42,934 --> 00:39:43,835
-  So did you guys make it in time?


716
00:39:45,707 --> 00:39:48,137
-  Yeah, yeah, he talked to her, but she got on the plane anyway.


717
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:52,233
-  Where's Ross?


718
00:39:53,115 --> 00:39:54,456
-  He went home. He didn't want to see anybody.


719
00:40:12,790 --> 00:40:15,538
- Ross, hi. It's me. ..

720
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,649
..I just got back on the plane. 

721
00:40:19,594 --> 00:40:20,826
And I just feel awful...

722
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:25,205
...That is so not how I wanted things to end with us...

723
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:34,485
...It's just that I wasn't expecting to see you, 
and all of a sudden you're there and saying these things... And... 

724
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,990
And now I'm just sitting here and thinking ...

725
00:40:39,326 --> 00:40:41,685
...of all the stuff I should have said, and I didn't.

726
00:40:41,686 --> 00:40:45,829
 I mean, I didn't even get to tell you that I love you too...

727
00:40:48,161 --> 00:40:49,131
...Because of course I do.

728
00:40:50,334 --> 00:40:51,050
... I love you...

729
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:54,174
...I love you...

730
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,536
...I love you...

731
00:40:58,288 --> 00:40:59,154
 What am I doing?

732
00:41:00,582 --> 00:41:01,663
I love you! 


733
00:41:04,813 --> 00:41:05,466
Oh, I've gotta see you. 

734
00:41:06,548 --> 00:41:07,309
I've gotta get off this plane.

735
00:41:08,168 --> 00:41:08,778
-  Oh my God!


736
00:41:10,331 --> 00:41:10,988
- Excuse me?


737
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:12,685
- Miss? Please, sit down!


738
00:41:13,627 --> 00:41:15,928
- I'm sorry. I'm really sorry, but I need to get off the plane, 

739
00:41:16,314 --> 00:41:17,819
.....okay? I need to tell someone that I love love them.

740
00:41:18,084 --> 00:41:19,369
- Miss, I can't let you off the plane.


741
00:41:19,921 --> 00:41:20,778
-  Let her off the plane!


742
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,968
- I am afraid you are gonna have to take a seat.


743
00:41:25,497 --> 00:41:26,898
- Oh, please, miss, you don't understand!


744
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:28,748
-  Try to understand!


745
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:33,547
- Oh, come on, miss, isn't there any way that you can just let me off...


746
00:41:34,706 --> 00:41:35,689
-  No! No!

747
00:41:37,549 --> 00:41:40,541
Oh my God. Did she get off the plane? 
Did she get off the plane?


748
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:45,348
-  I got off the plane.

749
00:41:56,229 --> 00:41:57,545
-  You got off the plane.


750
00:42:09,866 --> 00:42:11,142
-  I do love you.


751
00:42:13,066 --> 00:42:15,547
-  I love you too, and I'm never letting you go again.


752
00:42:16,111 --> 00:42:17,711
-  Okay. 'Cause this is where I wanna be, 

753
00:42:18,122 --> 00:42:20,109
okay? No more messing around. 
I don't wanna mess this up again.

754
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:22,096
-  Me neither, okay? We are - 

755
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:23,658
we're done being stupid.

756
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,214
-  Okay. You and me, alright? This is it.


757
00:42:26,618 --> 00:42:27,092
-  This is it.

758
00:42:27,828 --> 00:42:28,830
... Unless we're on a break.

759
00:42:40,073 --> 00:42:41,419
-  Don't make jokes now.


760
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:05,420
-  Okay, please be careful with that. It was my grandmother's. Be careful.


761
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,023
-  If that falls off the truck, it wouldn't be the worst thing.


762
00:43:20,037 --> 00:43:20,975
Wow

763
00:43:23,224 --> 00:43:23,722
-  I know...


764
00:43:24,923 --> 00:43:26,164
...It seems smaller somehow.

765
00:43:30,014 --> 00:43:31,623
-  Has it always been purple?


766
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,079
- Look around, you guys...

767
00:43:37,539 --> 00:43:38,514
...This was your first home...

768
00:43:40,647 --> 00:43:41,631
...And it was a happy place...

769
00:43:43,033 --> 00:43:45,423
....filled with love and laughter...

770
00:43:46,892 --> 00:43:47,629
.. But more important..

771
00:43:47,933 --> 00:43:50,262
.. because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!

772
00:43:56,054 --> 00:43:59,644
-  Hey, do you realise that at one time or another we all lived in this apartment?


773
00:44:01,707 --> 00:44:02,581
-  Oh, yeah, that's true.


774
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,678
-  Uh, I haven't.


775
00:44:06,786 --> 00:44:09,231
-  Wait a minute. What about that 
summer during college that you lived with grandma,

776
00:44:09,516 --> 00:44:11,005
And you tried to make it as a dancer?


777
00:44:17,487 --> 00:44:20,464
-  Do you realise we almost made 
it ten years without that coming up?


778
00:44:25,725 --> 00:44:28,690
-  Oh, honey, I forgot. I promised Treeger that we'd leave our keys.


779
00:44:29,588 --> 00:44:30,268
-  Oh, okay.


780
00:45:04,473 --> 00:45:06,033
-  So, I guess this is it.


781
00:45:09,008 --> 00:45:11,466
-  Yeah. I guess so.


782
00:45:14,297 --> 00:45:14,905
- This is harder than I thought it would be.


783
00:45:16,749 --> 00:45:17,601
-  Oh, it's gonna be okay.


784
00:45:29,836 --> 00:45:32,700
- Do you guys have to go to the new 
house right away, or do you have some time?


785
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:38,282
-  We got some time.


786
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:40,035
-  Okay, should we get some coffee?


787
00:45:41,402 --> 00:45:41,851
-  Sure. 

788
00:45:44,236 --> 00:45:45,405
Where?

789
00:45:51,223 --> 00:45:59,421
THE END
