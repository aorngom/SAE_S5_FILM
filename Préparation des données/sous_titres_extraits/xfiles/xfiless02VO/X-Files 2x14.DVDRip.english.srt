1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,359
- All in favour.
- Aye.

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,351
All right.

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,999
Starting Monday...

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,996
...the track around the athletic field will be
closed to joggers at 8.30pm instead of 10.

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,154
Any other items before we call it a night?

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,231
Yeah. Uh...

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,717
I got wind that for the
spring drama production...

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,590
...Howard Roberts intends to
put on <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i>

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,229
You know how he is. Howard's just
trying to do things the kids like.

10
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:41,754
My point exactly.

11
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,311
I don't think that play is appropriate
for this high school.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:51,155
If he wants to be young, I have no
problems with <i>Grease</i> or <i>Annie,</i> or...

13
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,199
- Doesn't <i>Grease</i> have the f-word?
- Look, I'll talk to Howard.

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:01:00,318
Let's adjourn till next week. Deborah,
why don't you lead us in the prayer.

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,949
- Jim, the game is on.
- It'll only take a minute.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,110
We've been letting it slip.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,234
Paul, why don't you get the door.

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,998

- <i>(boy)</i> It's just up here a ways.

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,948
I heard the altar is a hollow stump.

31
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,951
When they get freaked...

32
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,076
...you get Kate. I take Andrea.

33
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,879
Those mittens are givin' me a gingrich!

34
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,871
This is it.

35
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,836
OK, I need a personal object from everyone.

36
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,671
All right. Now, Andrea,
you get to stand over here...

37
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,548
...and face Jerry, like this.

38
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:20,393
- Closer.
- Why like this?

39
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,393
Well, that's so, uh... that's so that we're
calling the spirits up of every direction.

40
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,271
Kate, you stand here and face me.

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,875
Do you really think someone
used this place for black magic?

42
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,788
- Come on, Dave!
- Shh.

43
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,114
In the name of the lords of darkness, rulers
of the earth, kings of the underworld, rise.

44
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,156
Rise to this place.

45
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,879
Uh, Azazel.

46
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,470

00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,509

- Forget this!
- Andrea!

51
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,836
Blessed art thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus!

52
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,310
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and at the hour of our death!

53
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,595
Andrea! Wait!

54
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:41,355
A hunter found him early this morning.

55
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,954
Couldn't have been dead more than 12 hours.

56
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:47,919
- They say this area is used by witches.
- "They"?

57
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,515
Well, everybody around here
knows about the things that go on.

58
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,636
They say people control things.

59
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,315
Any evidence to substantiate
those rumours, Sheriff Oakes?

60
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,189
Agent Scully, look at the body.
The eyes and heart have been cut out.

61
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:04,431
Many homicides involve victim desecration.

62
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,318
I know he and his friends
listen to devil music.

63
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,118
"The Night Chicago Died"?

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,988
You know what I mean.
Those heavy-metal bands that influence kids.

65
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,353
Was Jerry Stevens ever witnessed
participating in witchcraft?

66
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,749
- No.
- More rumours.

67
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,598
This stump here is supposed
to be the ceremonial altar.

68
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,069
What do you think?

69
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,075
With turquoise chips, a picture of
John Wayne and three cans of shellac...

70
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,038
...it'd make a pretty nice coffee table.

71
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:38,511
<i>(sheriff)</i> You see all that wax?
Someone's been burning candles in there.

72
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,392
- Any idea who Jerry Stevens was with?
- We assume he was alone.

73
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:47,554
Most people don't set out to drink
two six-packs by themselves.

74
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,953
I also found this. It has purple ink on the edge
like a library identification stamp.

75
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,318
The end of the title says "in America".
I'm surprised you people overlooked it.

76
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:00,472
I'm sorry, I... I gotta apologise here.
You're right.

77
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,838
I admit, we're a little rattled here.
That's why I called the FBI.

78
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,718
This may involve a deeper conspiracy.

79
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:12,353
See, I grew up around here...
Ever since I was a kid I heard... stories.

80
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:19,639
This is a weird area. It has a strange air
that I could chalk up to imagination...

81
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,075
...till today.

82
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,551
I'll have my staff start checking
libraries for you, Agent Scully.

83
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,632
Better hide your Megadeth albums.

84
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,792
Theories like that are why
I can't take him seriously.

85
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,715
The homicide had a ceremonial presentation.
The manner in which the body was displayed.

86
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,268
I got the impression you didn't believe him.

87
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,238
I didn't want to incite
his aggravated imagination...

88
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,915
...but there is a weird feel to this place.
Maybe there's truth in the rumours.

89
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,270
I think he incited <i>your</i> imagination.

90
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,239
I think it's nothing more than a murderer
taking advantage of local folklore.

91
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,992
There's nothing odd about...

92
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,279
So...

93
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,114
- Lunch?
- Mulder, toads just fell from the sky!

94
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,510
I guess their parachutes didn't open.

95
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:26,195
You were saying something
about this place not feeling odd?

Look, I swear I've never
done anything like that.

What made you go to a place
you heard was a witches' altar?

110
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,870
We were just trying to get some.

111
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,951
I told you.

Why did you take the book?

113
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:14,433
I don't know a thing about witchcraft, and we
wanted it to sound good. I never thought...

114

You never thought what?

115
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,358
That it would work.

116
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,353
If you didn't kill Jerry Stevens,
why did you run away from us?

117
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,431
I'm scared, man.

118
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,638
- Of us?
- Of it. That ceremony.

119
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,632
I'm afraid we called up
some devil or something.

120
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,479
One of you killed Jerry Stevens.

121
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,391
Who?

122
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,958
He was displayed according
to the rites of Azazel.

123
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,077
Who else would know about the ritual?

124
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,879
- We stopped doing this because...
- I went out there.

125
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,555
We were supposed to have a Mass.
No one else showed, so I left.

126
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,315
- It wasn't any of us.
- Something is here.

127
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,393

- You're letting them go?
- There's no evidence to warrant an arrest.

130
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:18,316
- They never leave evidence.
- We heard how Jerry died. An occult ritual.

131
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,836
- They've reached into our area from outside.
- "They" again.

132
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,878
Those three kids are obviously
under a cult influence.

133
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,555
They reach into our children,
in music, television, books.

134
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,995
They prey on children's innocence.

135
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,150
The FBI did a seven-year study...

136
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,279
...and found no evidence of
the existence of occult conspiracies.

137
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,592
And J Edgar Hoover never admitted
to the existence of the Mafia.

138
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,752
If the murders attributed to
occult conspiracies were true...

139
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,991
...it would mean thousands of people
killing tens of thousands...

140
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,674
...without evidence, without being exposed.

141
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,356
It would be the greatest criminal conspiracy
in the history of civilisation!

142

Finally... you people understand
what we're up against.

143
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,309
Our investigation is ongoing.

144
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,511
Mulder, this is mass hysteria.

145
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:20,116
And our presence here gives validity
to their fears of occult murders.

146
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,273
- The water.
- What's wrong with it?

147
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,275
It's going down the drain counterclockwise.

148
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,638
Coriolis force in the northern hemisphere
dictates it should go down clockwise.

149
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,315
- That isn't possible.
- Something is here, Scully.

150
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,631
Something is making these things possible.

You're familiar with the indications

That would be a betrayal of the
doctor/patient relationship. Sorry.

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,197
He was pretty quick to dismiss my concerns.

169
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,236
Maybe there's nothing here.

170
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,197
Or he's hiding something.

171
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,432
Take a look at this.
I found this on the Internet.

172
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,637
"The discovery of a mutilated
teenage boy in the forest...

173
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:51,669
...has police distressed about the possibility
of an organisation of dark forces."

174
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,229
Where's that from? The local paper?

175
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:59,314
"The Jew is known to remove organs and
sacrifice teens in their religious ceremonies."

176
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,154
It's taken from <i>Völkischer Beobachter.</i>
A Nazi newspaper in 1934.

177
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,677
Same rumours, but the blanks have been
filled in with whoever is feared at the time.

178
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,228
In this case it's occultists.

179
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,753
Modern witches, known as Wiccan,
are a religion.

180
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,469
They revere all life and nature.
They do not cast harmful spells.

181
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,189
They don't worship Satan. The Church
of Satan renounced murder and torture.

182
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:25,193
Their influence here wouldn't
account for the frogs or the water...

183
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,555
...or, most importantly, the murder.

184
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,835
Well, if not witches, then what?

185
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:38,108
For your final exam, your grade will be based
on your diagram of a dissected pig embryo.

186
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,478
These are actually hog embryos,
belonging to the order of the artiodactyl...

187
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,510
...or creatures with hooves. Be sure to remove
the heart and lungs and draw diagrams.

188
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,511
Be neat.

189
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,035
Extra credit will be given
for dissecting the heart.

190
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,588
You have until the end of the period.

191
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,074
I'll cut it open, if you do the heart.

192
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,312
OK.

193
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,431
<i>(screaming)</i>

194
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,478
I've had this happen before. Some kids
just have trouble dissecting things.

195
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:49,389
Shannon, I'm trying to reach your father
and get him to pick you up.

196
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,311
No!

197
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,714
- I'm sure he'll be here soon.
- No!

198
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,473
- Shannon!
- Shannon, honey, come back!

199
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,834
Shannon! You're remembering!

200
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,109
Tell me what you remember.

201
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,270
You, um... know who my stepdad is, right?

202
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,434
Jim Ausbury on the PTC.

203
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,191
All right, well...

204
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,951
My mom, she's a teacher.

205
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,759
Well... <i>was</i> a teacher.

206
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,193
My real dad, he, um...

207
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,669
He ran away.

208
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,719
And... my mom met Jim at
some seminar or something.

209
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,349
And they, um...

210
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,308
...they got married.

211
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,671
My sister and I moved up here
when I was about, um...

212
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,671
...four.

213
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,594
She was about two.

214
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:10,070
Anyway, a couple of weeks ago...

215
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:16,516
...my class, we took a field trip to what
they call the American Stonehenge.

216
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,191
And...

217
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:23,236
...I remember, when I was four years old...

218
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,759
...Jim... took me in his car...

219
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,192
...near there. And he, um...

220
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,955
...he made me...

221
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,717
...in the back seat.

222
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,592
He told me that, if I ever told
anybody, he would hurt me.

223
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,438
As he touched me, you know, I would
pretend like I was out of my body...

224
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:01,749
...deep in the ocean, down with the fish...

225
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,669
...in the dark water.

226
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,756
Somehow I managed to
block out all these things.

227
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:14,310
But... lately it's all been...

228
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,309
I'm remembering, you know?

229
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,109
The others, too.

230
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,710
Others?

231
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,472
Yeah.

232
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,710
Men and women.

233
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,874
They would, um, come to the house,
you know, when my mom was away.

234
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,030
And they would take me
down to the basement.

235
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:41,716
It was really dark. It was, like,
painted red with a dirt floor.

236
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:46,356
They would wear these robes, black and red.

237
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:51,675
And they would sing and they would chant.

238
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,431
And then they would tie me and my sister up.

239
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,915
These men and women,
they would make us do things.

240
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,120
They called me a breeder.

241
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,315
They would get me pregnant and
then they would kill the babies.

242
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,518
I've had three children, and
they're all buried in the cellar.

243
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,800
One night...

244
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,555
...Jim murdered my sister for a sacrifice.

245
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,074
She was only eight years old!

246
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:40,394
He told everybody that
she'd died in an accident.

247
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:43,437
Today brought it all back...

248
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,590
...clear like it happened yesterday.

249
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,390
Imagine if what she said is true.

250
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,473
Why don't we just wait and see
what her parents have to say.

251
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,033
Where's Shannon? They told me
you were bringing her home.

252
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,671
She wanted to remain with friends.
Under the circumstances, we thought it best.

253
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,912
Circumstances? Why wouldn't
she want to come home?

254
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:28,748
Someone, or something, has obviously
put these things into her mind.

255
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,392
Mrs Ausbury, perhaps
you'd like a glass of water?

256
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,152
Yeah. Thank you.

257
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,551
Mr Ausbury...

258
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:56,156
Mrs Ausbury, your daughter has not accused
you of any involvement in these activities.

259
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:02,230
Do you have any idea why Shannon
might have said these things?

260
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,950
Jim and I have been having
marriage problems lately.

261
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:12,637
We're committed to working them out. Maybe
we don't pay enough attention to Shannon.

262
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,915
She and I don't...

263
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,193
We don't get along. We fight.

264
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,754
Have you ever known Shannon
to be pregnant?

265
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:30,196
Of course not! She's fifteen years old!

266
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,356
- How can you possibly believe...
- Have you ever had another child?

267
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,036
A girl.

268
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,350
Theresa.

269
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,829
She died.

270
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,388
At eight years old?

271
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,948
Eight weeks...

272
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,634
...with crib death.

273
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,196
Did you do it?

274
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:13,314
I would kill... anyone... who did
the things to her that she claims.

275
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,478
Not a very Christian tenet.

276
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:29,397
<i>(Ausbury)</i>
Thou, God of vengeance, shine forth!

277
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,669
Even the devil can quote
scripture to fit his needs.

278
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,197
How dare you! Get out of our house!

279
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,956
As far as I know, you put those
ideas in my daughter's head.

280
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,031
Now get out!

281
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,677
The devil travels in many forms.

282
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,149
And you may be one!

283
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,916
Are you sure you're up to this, Shannon?
I heard about what you said.

284
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,629
I'll be OK. I don't wanna miss the final.

285
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,792
I'll be in my office, if you're feeling funny.

286
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:22,238
You ought to remove yourjewellery. You
wouldn't want to lose it in some pig's guts.

287
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,914
I'll hold it until you're finished.

288
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,311

<i>(screaming)</i>

292
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,594
I heard the chair and a crash and
I came running out of the office.

293
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,472
Did you see anybody leaving the room?

294
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,235
Did you hear the door open?

295
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,950
I lock the doors after school
when I'm alone. I... I get afraid.

296
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,878
I feel a dark angel is amongst us.

297
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,349
It wants a sacrifice.

298
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,352
It's been years since...
since we've done that.

299
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,078
Exactly.

300
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,799
Exactly. We haven't kept our faith.

301
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,876
Are any of you...
responsible for my daughter?

302
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,911
We all are. She was sacrificed for us.

303
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,232
It's a portent. Shannon's death allows
us to get rid of the police, the FBI...

304
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,993
It can all be blamed on her.

305
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,110
Jim... you tell them she had
a thing for Jerry Stevens.

306
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,993
She killed him out ofjealousy.

307
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:04,313
She cut out his eyes... because she couldn't
stand to have him look at another girl.

308
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:08,552
And his heart... because she was heartbroken.

309
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:15,512
But when they leave, and are gone, we must
rekindle our faith... rather than lose it.

310
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:39,356
I never imagined she would hurt herself.
I'm old-fashioned, Agent Scully.

311
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,073
I can't believe that children are capable
of such things as they are these days.

312
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,153
She wanted me to hold that for her.

313
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,989
Excuse me.

314
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,229
Her office has a faint odour of incense.

315
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,110
- She says it stops the smell of formaldehyde.
- It's also used in Black Mass rituals.

316
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,919
I must admit, there are some
oddities to her story.

317
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,797
What do you mean, "oddities"?

318
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:17,998
The man she replaced has taken
two sick days in a 15-year career.

319
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,949
The morning of Jerry Stevens' murder,
Mr Kingery developed necrotising fasciitis.

320
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,794
- Flesh-eating bacteria? That's very rare.
- I know.

321
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,795
And when I questioned the staff about Mrs
Paddock, no one can even recall hiring her.

322
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,757
<i>(thunder)</i>

323
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,872
Oh, look, <i>I'm</i> even getting caught up in this.

324
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:48,795
I'm sure Mrs Paddock's arrival and the
teacher's sickness is just a coincidence.

325
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,758
The fact that no one recalls
hiring her is an oversight.

326
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,115
This is something
we should get caught up in.

327
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,079
I'll search the Ausbury house.
I've been told they're staying with friends.

328
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,151
You check Mrs Paddock.

336
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,349
I was raised to believe Christianity
was synonymous with hypocrisy.

337
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:46,629
Man's natural tendency was to "do what
thou willst", not "do unto others".

338
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,756
We believe...

339
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,919
...man is nothing but an animal.

340
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,630
No better, no worse, than those
that walk on four legs.

341
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:04,271
And although I believed our faith
kept us powerful in the community -

342
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,749
wealthy, good health -

343
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,630
...I came to see hypocrisy in the others.

344
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,428
In me.

345
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,990
When they told me...

346
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,760
...to blame my dead daughter...
for Jerry Stevens' death...

347
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,274
...my reaction...

348
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,751
I was sick... that they would
vilify an innocent...

349
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,910
...someone I loved...

350
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,798
...just to protect themselves.

351
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:47,351
And, at that moment, I knew
I am better than an animal.

352
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,998
That my... previous beliefs...

353
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,119
...were responsible... for her
no longer being with us.

354
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,548
And that it was time to talk to you.

355
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,230
Clean.

356
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,311
<i>(strained breathing)</i>

357
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,797
- Did you abuse Shannon?
- Never sexually.

358
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,871
And the rituals?

359
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,349
The blood of the young is
considered very powerful.

360
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:52,149
We'd include them in the ceremonies,
against their will.

361
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,278
They were too young to be trusted not to talk,
but we never physically hurt them.

362
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,796
We'd slip over the ancient rituals
that we didn't want to do.

363
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:06,192
Like drinking grape juice
instead of wine at Communion?

364
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,314
What about Shannon's memories?

365
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:19,637
We'd perform a sort of posthypnotic
suggestion that repressed their memories.

366
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,790
When they came of age - 18, 21 -

367
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:26,317
...then they were made aware of the religion
and brought into its practice.

368
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,837
When she recalled the past events,
she must've mixed up reality with...

369
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,708
...with that crap that's on <i>Geraldo</i>
and the tabloids.

370
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,712
Did the others kill Jerry Stevens?

371
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,670
Shannon?

372
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,390
No.

373
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,311
But you are responsible.

374
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,439
You knew the possibilities contained in
your beliefs, no matter how watered down.

375
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:54,229
Did you really think you could call up
the devil and ask him to behave?

376
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,549
Who are the others?

377
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,391
<i>(phone rings)</i>

378
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,677
- Yeah?
- <i>Mulder, the school. I'm in trouble.</i>

379
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,591
Scully?

380
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,831
We've got an emergency.
I'm placing you under arrest.

381
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,638
I'll be back for you later.

382
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,511
<i>(thunder)</i>

383
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,711
<i>(brakes screeching)</i>

384
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,351
<i>(Ausbury sobbing)</i>

385
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,148
Agh!

386
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,676
- Scully?!
- Mulder, what's wrong?

387
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,880
- You called. You said you were in trouble.
- No, I didn't touch the phone.

388
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,911
<i>(thunder)</i>

389
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,551
Ausbury confessed to conspiracy. He'll name
everybody involved. Parents. Teachers.

390
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:17,031
I checked on Mrs Paddock's background.
I don't think she's involved.

391
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,591
My God!

392
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:47,793
Do you think it's some kind of acid?

393
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:53,431
There's no evidence of any reaction
with the wood from the acid.

394
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,192
There are tracks in the dirt,
like from a snake.

395
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,831
That's impossible.

396
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,278
It would take a large python hours to
consume and weeks to digest a human being.

397
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:08,272
You really do watch the Learning Channel.

398
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,919
Scully... snakeskin.

399
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,671
There's a python in Paddock's room.

400
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:25,591
Sheriff Oakes called me. Jim Ausbury is dead.

401
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,471
He was talking to the FBI.

402
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,231
Did they kill him?

403
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,711
You know who killed him.

404
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,755
Ausbury was no believer.

405
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,072
He had no real faith. No devotion.
He was punished for his doubts.

406
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,269
We have to act...

407
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,876
...or the same will happen to us,
if it's not already too late.

408
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,118
We have to assume Jim
told them who we are.

409
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,432
If Mulder knows, it will make the
offering all the more meaningful.

410
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,871
They're here.

411
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,275
Lock the office.

412
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:26,114
My keys. They were in my pocket.

413
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,032
Mulder...

414
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,598
Mrs Paddock? What happened?

415
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,718
I... I came back. They were taking the snake.

416
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,513
Mrs Brown, Mr Vitaris... there are
things about them I learned.

417
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,832
- I think they killed that boy.
- We know about them.

418
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,117
Conference room. It's all there.

419
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,668
The paramedics must be
tied up by the storm.

420
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:09,638
Just stay there, Mrs Paddock.
We're gonna lock the door.

<i>(thunder)</i>

422
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,120
Just stay still. I'll be back.

Oh, God!

429
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,638
Mulder, did you see his expression?

430
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,634
It was as if something had control of him.

431
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,551
Paddock.

432
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,831
Mrs Paddock?

433
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,391
Mulder.

434
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,880
Goodbye. It's been nice working with you.
