1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,837
It's gonna crash.

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,993
Are you saying these men are clones?

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,548
Unless you protect us, we are already dead.

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,916
- Who is Mom talking to?
- Your sister.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,479
I'm in danger, Fox.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,037
- Scully.
- <i>(Mulder) Scully, it's me. Where are you?</i>

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,595
<i>Scully? Are you there?</i>

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,191
<i>Scully?</i>

9
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,472
Sir.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,197
Captain.

11
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,270
- What have you got?
- I'm not sure, sir.

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,796
We picked up some paint
approximately two minutes ago.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,635
- Looks like it's just hanging there.
- It's 200 metres below the ice.

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,678
Looks to be about 80 metres across
and it's noisy.

15
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,399
- Noisy how?
- It's emitting radio signals...

16
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:14,439
...but it's just random noise, sir.
We can't detect any pattern.

17
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,237
Get me Pacific Command
on the satellite uplink.

18
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,515
Admiral. I don't know what we've found,
but it appears to be some kind of craft.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,110
Yes, sir, that's correct.

20
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,239
But we're on a cartography mission,
Admiral. My crew isn't prepared to...

21
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,157
Yes, sir.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,991
Understood, sir.

23
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:46,915
Set a course. Heading 047.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,195
Toward the object, sir?

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,114
Weapons room. Lock torpedoes on target.
Prepare to fire on command.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:57,954
- Captain, shouldn't we identify it?
- We have our orders, Lieutenant.

27
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:00,031
- But, sir...
- <i>(piercing tone)</i>

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,111
The reactor's gone down.

29
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,116
- Engine room!
- That won't work. We're on battery power.

30
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,237
I'm going down there.
Prepare to surface at once!

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,234
Surface into what?
We're under 32 feet of glacial ice.

32
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,749
<i>(Mulder) Scully? Are you there?</i>

33
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,470
<i>Scully? What's going on?</i>

34
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,151
No. Sorry.

35
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,789
- Who was that?
- It's a wrong number.

36
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,472
- Where have you been, Mulder?
- I was trying to reach you.

37
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:47,917
I went by your house, but you weren't there.
I got here as quickly as I could.

38
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,834
- Why didn't you call me?
- I did call. I couldn't get through.

39
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,710
- Put your hands against the wall.
- Scully...

40
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,995
I said put your hands against the wall!

41
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,230
- What's wrong?
- Do it!

42
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,311
Scully, it's me.

43
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,709
I don't know who you are.

44
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,358
I'm gonna take my left hand and reach into
my pocket for my ID, OK? Don't shoot me.

45
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,830
- I got shot once and I didn't much...
- I said keep your hands up!

46
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,111
Where is he?

47
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,350
That was him on the phone, wasn't it?

48
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,111
Tell me where he is.

49
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,874
I don't know what you're talking about.

50
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,231
<i>(Scully groans)</i>

51
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,591
<i>(Mulder)</i> Scully!

52
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,511
<i>(flicks switch)</i>

53
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,595
<i>(Samantha)</i> He's been here.

54
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,599
Your partner is alive. He took her to get me.

55
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,798
- But she wouldn't have just let him in.
- She might not have known who he was.

56
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,394
She might have thought it was you.

57
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:21,949
He'll contact you. He'll say he wants
to make a trade - your partner's life for mine.

58
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,077
- Why does he want to kill you?
- Because I know how to kill <i>him.</i>

59
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,720
- How?
- By piercing the base of his skull.

60
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,157
- That'll kill anybody.
- Yes, but this is the only way to kill him.

61
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,754
- I'm fairly sure it'll work.
- <i>Fairly</i> sure?

62
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,913
He's got powers I've never seen before.
If it doesn't work, you could die.

63
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,115
From what?

64
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:43,078
Their blood is toxic.
Human exposure to it is fatal.

65
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,628
- I know this must seem incredible...
- No. No, no.

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,315
That's just it. It doesn't seem incredible at all.
How do we find him?

67
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,398
We don't. He'll find us.

68
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,996
- He'll call.
- You're sure.

69
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,833
- I know what he wants.
- And if he doesn't get it?

70
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,674
- I know this is hard for you, Fox.
- No, it's not hard. It's unbelievable.

71
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,877
- You don't believe me.
- After 22 years, why come back?

72
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,997
- I've explained.
- You've explained only what you had to!

73
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,995
I know next to nothing about your so-called
parents or the man who wants to kill them!

74
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:29,995
The men you've been seeking
are the progeny of two original visitors.

75
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,119
Clones who have been attempting to
establish a colony here since the late 1940s.

76
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,031
- A colony?
- Loosely.

77
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,918
The community, by necessity, is dispersed.

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,788
Clones identical to my parents live
in virtually every part of the country.

79
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,791
What are they trying to accomplish?

80
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,668
It's their belief that our stewardship
of the planet is being forsaken...

81
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:52,070
...and that, by default,
they'll become the natural heirs.

82
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,151
And in the meantime?

83
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,553
Through hybridisation they've been erasing
that aspect which has forced them to scatter:

84
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,200
...their identical natures.

85
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,953
All the clones worked
in abortion clinics. Why?

86
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,749
Access to foetal tissue.
Though the biologies are incompatible...

87
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:13,038
...they finally found a way
to combine human DNA with alien DNA.

88
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,749
And this man...
Why has he been sent to kill them?

89
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,115
The experiments weren't sanctioned.

90
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:25,591
It was considered a dilution of
their species, a pollution of their race.

91
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,310
So a bounty hunter was dispatched
to destroy them and terminate the colony.

92
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,030
That's a good story.
But I've heard a lot of good stories lately.

93
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,909
I've got no reason to lie to you.

94
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,878
I'm your sister, Fox. You have to trust me.

95
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,717
<i>(knocking)</i>

96
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,071
Who is it?

97
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,111
Skinner.

98
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,513
- Mulder?
- The door's open.

99
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,071
Make yourself at home.

100
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,239
What's going on, Agent Mulder?
Why are the lights out?

101
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,595
Orders from my ophthalmologist.

102
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,108
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

103
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,634
I've been trying to reach
you and Agent Scully.

104
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,915
I haven't checked my messages.

105
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,510
Agent Scully incarcerated four men
with the federal marshal's office...

106
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,795
...and those men are now missing.

107
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,830
It's all right. It's not him.

108
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:13,193
What the hell is going on here, Mulder?

109
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,591
- This is my sister. Samantha Mulder.
- What?

110
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,268
I've no time to explain.
Agent Scully is missing.

111
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,954
- What do you mean, missing?
- <i>(phone)</i>

112
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,230
- Hello.
- Mulder, it's me.

113
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,915
- Scully, where are you?
- I don't know. I'm in a telephone booth.

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,913
He's got my gun, Mulder. He says he'll kill
me if you don't give him what he wants.

115
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,470
- What does he want?
- A woman who is with you.

116
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,313
He says you'll know what I'm talking about.

117
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,476
- Tell him we'll negotiate.
- He doesn't wanna negotiate.

118
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:49,473
- He says he wants to make a trade.
- All right, let me speak to him!

119
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,472
He says be at Memorial Bridge
in Bethesda in one hour.

120
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,154
- Scully, I need more time than that.
- Mulder...

121
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,350
Where is she? What's this negotiation?

122
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:05,275
We don't have any time. If I ever needed
your help, your trust, I need it now.

123
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,555
Mulder's in position.

124
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,158
We just need to make him think
we're gonna make a trade.

125
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,595
- We just need one shot.
- To the base of the neck.

126
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,433
These guys can hollow out
a dime at 200 yards.

127
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,750
Now, Samantha...

128
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,752
Do not take any unnecessary risks out there.

129
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,591
Scully?

130
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,431
Bring her out.

131
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,351
Take your shot when you got it.

132
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,235
Step close. Right up close.

133
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,912
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

134
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,991
- Yeah?
- I'm OK.

135
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,239
Samantha!

136
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,436
I lost the shot.

137
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,759
There's no way out.
We got both sides of the bridge covered.

138
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,591
Now let her go!

139
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,794
- Tell me where she is.
- Let her go!

140
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,673
<i>(gunshot)</i>

141
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,471
Samantha!

142
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,551
Samantha!

143
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,751
Spread it out.

144
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,591
Clear.

145
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,109
There's some debris under the bridge.

146
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:01,631
- Mulder...
- You should be in the hospital, Scully.

147
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,870
I was discharged an hour ago.

148
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,032
- Have they found anything yet?
- Nothing yet.

149
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,554
Do you think she could have survived?

150
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:13,997
- Maybe. But the water's 36°
- Maybe she went into hypothermic shock.

151
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:19,279
I've heard about people that have lived after
being in water like this eight to ten hours.

152
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,716
Mulder, why didn't you tell me
on the phone that it was her?

153
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,917
- I couldn't tell you.
- Why not?

154
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,153
Because you'd never
let me go through with it.

155
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,272
- Are you sure that it's your sister?
- Why would you even question me on that?

156
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,557
Because back at the motel it was you.
But it wasn't you.

157
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,631
Well, it was her!

158
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,156
- Then who is this man and where's he...
- He's an alien.

159
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,114
- Is that what you're gonna tell Skinner?
- I already told him. That was easy.

160
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:51,395
Now I gotta tell my father.

161
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:01,076
You didn't have me come all this way
to give me good news.

162
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,996
What is it, Fox?

163
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,594
Samantha's gone... Dad.

164
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,511
I lost her.

165
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,669
What do you mean, you lost her?

166
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,511
There was a man.

167
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,393
He was holding my partner hostage
in exchange for Samantha.

168
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,673
You let this man take your sister.

169
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:46,797
Isn't that what you're trying to tell me?

170
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,314
I can't explain it to you, but, um...

171
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,119
I believed I was doing the right thing, Dad.

172
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,751
Was this your decision?

173
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,271
Yes.

174
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,356
I'll tell Mom.

175
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:16,277
Do you realise what losing her again
is going to do to your mother?

176
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,952
Do you?

177
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,755
I'm sorry, Dad.

178
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,791
I'm sorry.

179
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,156
I'm... I'm sorry.

180
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:55,116
Your sis...

181
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,636
Samantha left this at the house for you.

182
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,111
<i>(phone rings)</i>

183
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,951
- Mulder.
- <i>Mulder, it's me.</i>

184
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,430
Scully, she left a path in case
we got separated. I think she's alive.

185
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,830
Mulder, I think you should come back
as soon as you can.

186
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,911
<i>Why? What'd you find?</i>

187
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,069
It's your sister.

188
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,720
We just pulled her body out of the river.

189
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,231
Mulder, I'm so sorry.

190
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,595
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

191
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,431
You know...

192
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,274
Whatever you're feeling,
you can't blame yourself.

193
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:17,273
What about a second body?
Did you find a second body?

194
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,351
No, not yet.

195
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,835
I'll be there as soon as I can.

196
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,431
- Agent Scully, something you need to see.
- What is it?

197
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,991
It's the body we pulled from the water.
Something strange is happening.

198
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:42,430
Federal agent. Keep your hands where
I can see them and turn around. Slowly.

199
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,071
Who are you?

200
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,597
- She's dead, isn't she?
- What the hell is going on?

201
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,194
Come, please. There's not much time.

202
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,791
Who are you?

203
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,871
Please.

204
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,188
- It was all a lie.
- We needed your help.

205
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,671
- We knew you could be manipulated.
- He'll be coming. We must hurry now.

206
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,751
Who?

207
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,755
The man who's been sent to kill us.

208
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,710
He's dead.

209
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,912
- How do you know?
- He was shot. In the back of the neck!

210
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,356
- How did he die?
- He fell off a bridge.

211
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,000
With one of you.

212
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:54,239
Then we don't know for sure.
You could have been followed.

213
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,118
Come with me. This way, Agent Mulder.

214
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,795
The rest of us are dispensable.

215
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,798
She was the first.
The one from which we all came.

216
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,871
The one you must save.

217
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,108
- I'm not your saviour.
- You must help us. You have no choice.

218
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,553
No, I... I do have a choice.

219
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,995
My choice is to walk outta here.

220
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,635
We know where your sister is.

221
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,632
Ask yourself, Agent Mulder, how else
would we know so much about her?

222
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,311
<i>(alarm rings)</i>

223
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,631
He's here.

<i>(coughs)</i>

225
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,511
I found one!

226
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,188
Sir, we're gonna get you outta here!

227
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,193
- What about the others?
- We got real lucky. There are no others.

228
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,669
No, wait! There were women in here.

229
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,718
- We looked. You're the only one.
- No! Keep looking!

230
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:02,276
<i>After treatment for smoke inhalation...</i>

231
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:07,195
<i>... Agent Mulder was released from</i>
<i>Samaritan Hospital in satisfactory condition.</i>

232
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,717
<i>At his request, the abortion clinic where</i>
<i>he was found has been searched repeatedly...</i>

233
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,270
<i>... but the bodies of the women</i>
<i>he insists perished were not found.</i>

234
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,079
<i>My report on this case remains incomplete.</i>

235
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:21,232
<i>Many aspects continue to defy explanation...</i>

236
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,790
<i>... including the identities</i>
<i>of the identical men and women.</i>

237
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,192
<i>Agent Mulder's claim of alien origins</i>
<i>cannot be substantiated.</i>

238
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,238
<i>The suspect in their disappearances</i>
<i>is still at large.</i>

239
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,438
<i>He has now been charged with the death</i>
<i>of FBI Special Agent Barrett Weiss...</i>

240
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:41,469
<i>... whose body is quarantined at the Medical</i>
<i>Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.</i>

241
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:44,472
<i>His cause of death involved</i>
<i>a thickening of the blood.</i>

242
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,836
<i>We now believe he was subjected</i>
<i>to a virulent strain of virus...</i>

243
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,798
<i>... whose origin and behaviour</i>
<i>are also unexplainable.</i>

244
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,557
<i>It is my hope that further analysis of this</i>
<i>contagion will aid in the solution of this case.</i>

245
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:01,156
- This is a retrovirus?
- Yes. But we've never seen anything like it.

246
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,954
Do you recognise it?

247
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,749
Was the thickening of the blood
an immunological response to the virus?

248
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:12,072
Apparently. Exposure to it triggers
a massive production of red blood cells.

249
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:17,518
Take a look at this. We took a second culture
and were able to control its growth.

250
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,999
What did you do?

251
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,709
All we did was lower
the temperature by 5° Fahrenheit.

252
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,997
- So the virus is inhibited by cold.
- Knocked out by it!

253
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,552
For some reason this retrovirus
goes dormant at cold temperatures.

254
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,669
We pulled a body from the river
that was chilled near freezing.

255
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,594
- When it started to thaw, it began to corrode.
- Corrode?

256
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:43,719
If you find out anything else,
you let me know as soon as possible.

257
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,275
You wanted to see me?

258
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,954
- How was the opera?
- I've never slept better.

259
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:07,555
I don't like these hasty
public meetings, Agent Mulder.

260
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:11,997
- I'm sorry. I need your help.
- It's over. The fat lady is singing.

261
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,071
I need to know what you know.

262
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,674
- OK. They're all dead.
- No!

263
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,197
One of them is alive. The one
who was sent to kill them. Where is he?

264
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:25,193
A nuclear submarine located his craft
in the Beaufort Sea five days ago.

265
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:28,033
They were ordered to destroy it,
but were disabled.

266
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,592
An attack fleet left Anchorage this morning
to make sure this man does not leave.

267
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,148
I gotta get up there.

268
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,789
You'll only win the war if you pick
the right battles, Agent Mulder.

269
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,269
This is a battle you can't win.

270
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,635
Mulder, it's me. Are you there?

271
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,711
<i>(computer starts up)</i>

272
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,631

<i>I'll be too far away for you to stop me...</i>

273
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,712

<i>I can't allow you to follow.</i>

274
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:43,079

<i>career for reasons purely personal to me.</i>

275
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:47,073
<i>You were right, Scully.</i>
<i>You said a line has to be drawn somewhere.</i>

276
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,799
<i>And I'm drawing it for you here.</i>

277
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,075
<i>I'll contact you when I can.</i>

278
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,476
Sir?

279
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,670
I'm sorry to come unannounced, sir,
but your assistant wasn't at her desk.

280
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,795
- What is it, Scully?
- May we speak off the record, sir?

281
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:13,439
- About?
- Agent Mulder.

282
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,671
He's gone.

283
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,234
- Where?
- I don't know. I was hoping you'd tell me.

284
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,596
Agent Mulder told me he was going to take
some time off after what he'd been through.

285
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:37,800
He told me the same thing, but I don't think
this matter with his sister is settled.

286
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:43,431
Sir, is there any way that you can reach him
through unofficial channels?

287
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,155
- I can't help you, Scully.
- Please!

288
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:55,356
Agent Scully, you and I both have a greater
responsibility to consider - to the FBI.

289
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,877
Mulder's actions are in violation of his duties,
his oath of trust and Bureau protocol.

290
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:04,397
- He's risked my position, your life...
- Agent Mulder <i>saved</i> my life!

291
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,914
If he wanted or expected you to do the same,
he would have told you where he was going.

292
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,917
Please close the door
on your way out, Agent Scully.

Sorry. I must have the wrong apartment.

Where's Mulder?

297
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:01,032
- I need to know, dammit!
- You've mistaken me for someone else.

Excuse me.

301
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,074
Did you tell her what she needed to know?

302
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,910
How hard do you wanna make this?

303
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,991
No harder than it has to be.

304
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,749
I've killed men for far less.

305
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,558
You pull that trigger,
you'll be killing two men.

306
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,915
Now, I wanna know where Mulder is.

<i>(knocking)</i>

308
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,073
Agent Mulder flew to Tacoma, Washington.

309
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,869
From there he caught a military plane
to Deadhorse, Alaska.

310
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,716
He used his FBI credentials
to charter an all-terrain vehicle.

311
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:21,553
It's still a ten-mile hike across the ice.

312
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,916
These are the coordinates
of his final destination.

313
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,155
- How did you get this?
- Unofficial channels.

- Who are you?
- Lieutenant Terry Wilmer.

Step outta there!

319
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,511
Come out!

320
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,911
What happened to you?

321
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,475
I don't know. We, uh...

322
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,875
We just lost power.

323
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:47,357
We... we drifted under the ice for days.

324
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,788
Then, um... then we hit a, uh...

325
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,871
Don't look at me! Face forward!

326
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,872
We hit a shallow patch
and punched through, OK?

327
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,951
That's what happened.

328
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,555
So why did you run?

329
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,795
A man came. He, um...

330
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,393
He sealed most of the men below decks
without any air and, uh...

331
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,438
And then he started to execute the rest of us.

332
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,196
Every... They're all dead.

333
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,159
I, uh... I thought you were him.
I didn't know if you were him.

334
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,629
How is it you managed to survive?

335
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,312
I hid under the body of the chief petty officer.

336
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,630
OK? I, um...

337
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,029
I played dead.

338
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,711
<i>(handcuffs lock)</i>

339
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,675
What's this for?

340
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,116
- What, are you crazy?
- No. I'm just tired.

341
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,757
You're not getting back to your ship
until I get the truth.

342
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,035
Tell me where my sister is.

343
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,157
- I don't know what you're talkin' about.
- Base of the neck!

344
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:00,314
Tell me how I can find her and I'll let you
get back to your ship before it's destroyed!

345
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,597
Please... Please, you're making
a really big mistake.

346
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,319
If I wanted to, I could have
killed you many times before.

347
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,391
Where is she?

348
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:27,108
Is the answer to your question worth
dying for? Is that what you want?

349
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,191
Where is she?

350
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,111
<i>(groans)</i>

351
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,916
Just tell me where she is!

352
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,831
She's alive.

353
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,271
Can you die now?

354
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,991
Agh!

355
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,991
No change in BP or pulse.

356
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,313
I'm Dana Scully, his partner.
What are his vitals?

357
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,995
- He's suffering from extreme hypothermia.
- No! Get him out of the tub.

358
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,789
- He's lost all his body heat.
- If you keep him in there, you'll kill him.

359
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,075
The cold is all that's keeping him alive.

360
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,798
His heart stopped!

361
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,714
- Give me one amp of epinephrine!
- You don't know what you're dealing with!

362
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,112
He has been exposed to a retrovirus
resulting in hyperviscosity syndrome.

363
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,556
- I want you out of my ER right now. Nurse!
- Yes. Ma'am...

364
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,393
His blood has thickened.
That's why his heart is failing.

365
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,472
His heart is failing
because he's lost all his body heat.

366
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,156
No, the only thing saving him right now is
the hypometabolic state induced by the cold.

367
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,028
Now, if you don't do what I'm saying,
you are going to kill him!

368
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,355
Let's get him out of that tub now.

369
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,589
Charged and ready.

370
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,671
- Clear.
- Clear.

371
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,431
- No rhythm.
- No.

372
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,511
- Clear.
- Clear.

373
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,116
- I'm picking up a faint pulse.
- Yes!

374
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,350
I want a digoxin 0.1mg IV.

375
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:45,316
Hang a heparin drip of 1,000 units per hour
and get two units of fresh frozen plasma now.

376
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,551
- This patient's not even...
- He's going to make it.

377
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,870
<i>Transfusions and an aggressive treatment</i>
<i>with antiviral agents...</i>

378
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,080
<i>... have resulted in a steady but gradual</i>
<i>improvement in Agent Mulder's condition.</i>

379
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:09,790
<i>Blood tests have confirmed his exposure</i>
<i>to the still unidentified retrovirus...</i>

380
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,440
<i>... whose origin remains a mystery.</i>

381
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:17,275
<i>The search team that found Agent Mulder</i>
<i>located neither the submarine...</i>

382
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,749
<i>... nor the man he was looking for.</i>

383
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,877
<i>Several aspects of this case</i>
<i>remain unexplained...</i>

384
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:27,112
<i>... suggesting the possibility</i>
<i>of paranormal phenomena.</i>

385
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,556
<i>But I am convinced that</i>
<i>to accept such conclusions...</i>

386
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:35,475
<i>... is to abandon all hope of understanding</i>
<i>the scientific events behind them.</i>

387
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,758
<i>Many of the things I've seen have challenged</i>
<i>my faith and my belief in an ordered universe.</i>

388
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,196
<i>But this uncertainty has only</i>
<i>strengthened my need to know...</i>

389
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,717
<i>... to understand, to apply reason</i>
<i>to those things which seem to defy it.</i>

390
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,991
<i>It was science that isolated the retrovirus</i>
<i>Agent Mulder was exposed to.</i>

391
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:00,873
<i>And science that allowed us to</i>
<i>understand its behaviour.</i>

392
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,230
<i>And ultimately... it was science</i>
<i>that saved Agent Mulder's life.</i>

393
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,671
<i>(grunts)</i>

394
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,431
Hey!

395
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,191
How you feelin'?

396
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,351
<i>(hoarse)</i> Like I got a bad case of freezer burn.

397
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,391
How did I get here?

398
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,114
A naval reconnaissance squad found you.

399
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,714
They choppered you to Eisenhower Field.

400
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,311
- Thanks for ditching me.
- I am sorry.

401
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,558
I couldn't let you risk your life on this.

402
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,678
Did you find what you were looking for?

403
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,037
No...

404
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,551
No.

405
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:29,678
But I found something I thought I'd lost.

406
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,516
Faith to keep looking.

407
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:52,395
