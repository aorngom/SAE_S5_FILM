1
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,552
- Hello?

2
00:00:29,629 --> 00:00:31,563
Hello!

3
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,534
Hey, I'm sittin' here,
dude!

4
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:39,265
Sorry. We're closed.

5
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,933
Uh-uh. I was here before
you turned off the light.

6
00:00:42,008 --> 00:00:44,909
Grandfather clause, man.

7
00:00:44,978 --> 00:00:47,105
I need a Super Patty Double
with cheese...

8
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,171
The light was a mistake.

9
00:00:49,249 --> 00:00:51,183
We're closed. Sorry.

10
00:00:51,251 --> 00:00:53,549
The light was on!

11
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,088
How bad do you want this job? 'Cause
I'll call the head office right now!

12
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:59,250
- Super Patty Double...

13
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:03,489
with cheese, super size fries,
super size Diet Sprite.

14
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,831
Drive through, please.

15
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,513
What the hell is this?

16
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:35,322
Customer service, man!
Stop spankin' it and get my food!

17
00:01:50,143 --> 00:01:52,941
Hey in there.

18
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,946
Guy?

19
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,603
You are your own man,

20
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:33,770
and you control everything
you do.

21
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:41,385
- How ya doin'?
- Hey, Rob.

22
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,387
- Hey, Mr. Rice.
- How's it going, Rob?

23
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:47,785
- Have a good one, Lucy.
- You too, Rob.

24
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:06,443
Welcome to Lucky Boy.
May I take your order?

25
00:04:06,511 --> 00:04:10,948
- Yeah, we'll have it our way.
- F.B.I. Special Agents
Scully and Mulder.

26
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:15,350
- We'd like a word with
your manager, please.
- How can I help you?

27
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:18,446
Sir, would you do us a favor
and gather your employees, please?

28
00:04:18,523 --> 00:04:20,957
- What's going on?
- We're investigating a murder.

29
00:04:21,026 --> 00:04:25,520
A car was found in a reservoir
ten miles from here. A body
was found in the trunk of that car.

30
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:29,397
- Well, what does that have
to do with us?
- This was also found in the car.

31
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:33,370
It's a badge that's only given
to employees. Is that correct?

32
00:04:33,438 --> 00:04:35,633
Yeah. "Free Fer Fridays."
It's our promotion...

33
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,641
where you buy one Super Patty
and get one free.

34
00:04:37,709 --> 00:04:41,372
But look, there's four Lucky Boys
in Costa Mesa alone,

35
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:43,380
and something like
30 in Orange County.

36
00:04:43,448 --> 00:04:45,609
- Thirty-two.
- Yeah, long day,
so let's make this quick.

37
00:04:45,684 --> 00:04:48,812
- Does everybody have their button?
- We only wear them on Fridays.

38
00:04:48,887 --> 00:04:50,821
"Free Fer Fridays."

39
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:54,488
Yeah, but does everybody
have their button?

40
00:05:14,746 --> 00:05:18,273
Hey, uh, you back there.
What's your name?

41
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,284
Derwood Spinks.

42
00:05:20,352 --> 00:05:23,116
Derwood. Do you have
your button, Derwood?

43
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:25,349
Uh, no, I must have
left it at home,

44
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:28,154
on account of we're supposed to
only wear 'em on Fridays.

45
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:33,689
Well, I sure as hell didn't
leave it on no dead guy.

46
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,126
I don't believe that we said
the victim was male.

47
00:05:39,204 --> 00:05:41,331
We're gonna ask everybody
to step outside right now...

48
00:05:41,406 --> 00:05:45,433
- While we take a quick look
around the premises.
- Who was the victim?

49
00:05:46,712 --> 00:05:48,703
His name was
Donald Edward Pankow.

50
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,714
Does that ring a bell?

51
00:05:50,782 --> 00:05:53,808
No.

52
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,059
I'm gonna get
some cigarettes.

53
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:17,971
I guess I'd better call
the corporate headquarters...

54
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:20,068
and find out what
they want us to do.

55
00:06:25,884 --> 00:06:27,852
Hey, Scully.

56
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,319
Check it out.
You know how they say...

57
00:06:30,388 --> 00:06:33,380
you never wanna see the kitchen
of any of your favorite restaurants?

58
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:37,519
Somehow, I don't think Lucky Boy
would make that list.

59
00:06:37,596 --> 00:06:40,827
My point being that this is a hell
of a lot cleaner than all the others.

60
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:43,925
- Don't you think?
- I guess.

61
00:06:44,002 --> 00:06:46,835
So what are you saying, Mulder?
This place has been scrubbed
from top to bottom...

62
00:06:46,905 --> 00:06:50,306
to cover up evidence?
-  Maybe.

63
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:53,936
Maybe I'm thinking
this was the crime scene.

64
00:06:54,012 --> 00:06:56,105
You're saying
Mr. Pankow had his brain...

65
00:06:56,181 --> 00:06:59,617
very neatly removed from his skull
right here in this kitchen?

66
00:06:59,684 --> 00:07:01,743
It had to happen somewhere.

67
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,254
But next to
the shake machine, Mulder?

68
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:06,415
I think that we should be
checking out employee lockers,

69
00:07:06,491 --> 00:07:10,222
and not entertaining the idea that
ad hoc surgery was performed here.

70
00:07:10,295 --> 00:07:13,560
I wouldn't exactly
call it "surgery."

71
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:18,695
What if this man's brain was eaten?
It's not sociologically unheard of.

72
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,967
There are certain tribes in New Guinea
that consider human brains a delicacy.

73
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,305
- Yeah, but, Mulder,
we're in Orange County.
- Yeah? What's your point?

74
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:27,311
It's just that...

75
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:30,246
nothing about the way the body was
dumped suggests a fetishistic killing.

76
00:07:30,315 --> 00:07:32,249
The brain
wasn't removed intact.

77
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:34,478
What if this man's brain
was eaten right out of his skull?

78
00:07:34,553 --> 00:07:38,421
Through an inch and a half opening that
looks like it was cut with a hole saw?

79
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,186
Well, maybe it was cut.
Maybe it was punched.

80
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,319
What looked like tool marks
to you looked to me like
something more organic.

81
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:47,263
Like it was made by a...

82
00:07:47,332 --> 00:07:50,597
a tongue, or a proboscis.

83
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,433
The proboscis of what?

84
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,174
I don't know.

85
00:07:57,242 --> 00:08:00,336
Oh. Hello.
Look at this.

86
00:08:01,913 --> 00:08:04,347
Does that look
like blood to you?

87
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:08,011
-  Yes, it looks like it.
-  What is that?

88
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:11,283
Next to it.
Is that, uh...

89
00:08:11,356 --> 00:08:14,484
Oh, my... Uh. Is that brain...
Is that brain matter there?

90
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:18,086
No, I'd say
that's ground beef.

91
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:21,833
-  Ground beef?
- Yeah.

92
00:09:10,414 --> 00:09:14,248
Rob Roberts?
It's Agent Mulder.

93
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,087
Hello, again.
I'm sorry to bother you at home.

94
00:09:20,157 --> 00:09:22,091
- No. No bother.
- Can I come in?

95
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:24,354
- Yeah, s-sure. Sure.
- Great. Great.

96
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:26,328
Uh, what...
what can I do for you?

97
00:09:26,397 --> 00:09:29,855
- You live here alone?
- Yeah, it's just me.

98
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:32,198
- Mom or girlfriend?
- What?

99
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,261
Come on, man.
Who cleans up after you?

100
00:09:34,338 --> 00:09:38,001
Neither. It's just me.
I-I live here alone.

101
00:09:38,075 --> 00:09:41,738
Well, bravo. You know, they say single
guys are just bears who own furniture.

102
00:09:41,812 --> 00:09:44,406
I mean, my place,
it's...

103
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:47,042
But here, you can smell
the Pine Sol.

104
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:49,916
- Thanks. Can I...
Can I get you anything?
- Yeah.

105
00:09:49,987 --> 00:09:52,455
Yeah, a cheeseburger
and a large order of fries.

106
00:09:54,525 --> 00:09:57,392
It's a bad joke. I'm sorry.

107
00:09:57,461 --> 00:10:00,328
Um, Mr. Rice,
your manager,

108
00:10:00,398 --> 00:10:03,629
he told me that, uh,
you stayed late on Friday.

109
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,635
- Is that right?
- Uh, yeah, sure. Friday.

110
00:10:05,703 --> 00:10:07,694
The freezer had died on us.

111
00:10:07,772 --> 00:10:10,536
I stayed after to throw out
the meat that was goin' bad.

112
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:13,873
- Yeah, did you volunteer to close?
- Yeah.

113
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:16,277
Yeah, okay.
You volunteered.

114
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:18,281
Volunteered.

115
00:10:20,184 --> 00:10:22,118
Um...

116
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:25,314
The, uh... The 35 pounds
of ground chuck...

117
00:10:25,389 --> 00:10:27,653
that Mr. Rice told you to throw away...
what did you do with that?

118
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,784
- I threw it out.
- Where?

119
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,624
In the Dumpster...
behind the restaurant.

120
00:10:32,697 --> 00:10:35,757
Hmm. That's weird.

121
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,064
That's what I figured you did, so I
checked the Dumpster, and it was empty.

122
00:10:39,136 --> 00:10:41,570
Which is weird because
it only gets cleaned out on Thursday,

123
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,573
and you would've thrown away
the meat on Friday.

124
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:47,077
So you'd expect the meat
to be there, right?

125
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:50,807
I don't see how that's relevant
to this murder case anyway.

126
00:10:50,881 --> 00:10:53,145
Let me see if there's anything else
I wanted to ask you.

127
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:56,586
Blood.

128
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,984
You're-You're bleeding.

129
00:11:05,696 --> 00:11:07,630
I-I bit my lip.

130
00:11:07,698 --> 00:11:09,962
Hmm.

131
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:13,026
I think that just about
wraps it up for me here, actually.

132
00:11:13,104 --> 00:11:16,369
Oh, hey, I, uh... I hope
you catch the guy, huh?

133
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,603
No, I already got
a pretty good idea who it is.

134
00:11:19,677 --> 00:11:21,611
Thanks.

135
00:12:16,934 --> 00:12:20,233
- What do you want?
- N-Nothing.

136
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:22,704
So take a hike.

137
00:12:31,982 --> 00:12:35,941
Uh, hi.
This is a message for Rob Roberts.

138
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,750
My name is
Dr. Mindy Reinhart,

139
00:12:38,823 --> 00:12:41,018
and I'm a licensed
mental health counselor...

140
00:12:41,092 --> 00:12:44,823
with the Lucky Boy Corporation's
Employee Assistance Program.

141
00:12:44,895 --> 00:12:47,523
I'm talking to all of
the employees at your restaurant...

142
00:12:47,598 --> 00:12:50,931
about the recent unpleasantness
that occurred there.

143
00:12:51,001 --> 00:12:54,960
Rob, I'd love for you to come down to my
office at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

144
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:58,770
As it is a requirement of your
employer's insurance provider,

145
00:12:58,843 --> 00:13:01,038
this meeting is mandatory.

146
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:05,105
I'm in the Irvine Medical Park,
suite 308.

147
00:13:05,182 --> 00:13:08,743
- Have a good evening.

148
00:13:26,904 --> 00:13:29,896
Self-discipline.
That's the name of this game.

149
00:13:29,974 --> 00:13:33,137
That's the one thing
that separates us from the animals,

150
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:35,144
provided you have it.

151
00:13:35,212 --> 00:13:37,271
So where do you get it?
You can't go down...

152
00:13:37,348 --> 00:13:39,714
to the local convenience store
and buy self-discipline.

153
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:42,513
You can't order it over the internet.
So where does it come from?

154
00:13:42,586 --> 00:13:47,319
True story. I used to weigh 356 pounds.

155
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,087
Do you believe that?
Well, it's true.

156
00:13:50,161 --> 00:13:52,254
I lived to eat,
ladies and gentlemen.

157
00:13:52,329 --> 00:13:56,527
My entire life revolved around eating,
because I was always hungry.

158
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,569
My appetite
was controlling me.

159
00:13:59,637 --> 00:14:02,435
Four-star restaurants, Denny's...
It didn't matter, and it didn't stop.

160
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:04,770
It didn't stop until
I took charge of my own life.

161
00:14:04,842 --> 00:14:07,868
It didn't stop until I put on
the brakes and I said, "Whoa!"

162
00:14:07,945 --> 00:14:10,778
Ricardo, you are your own man,

163
00:14:10,848 --> 00:14:13,715
and you control everything
that you do.

164
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:36,505
Oh, brother.
What?

165
00:14:58,161 --> 00:15:00,789
What... Derwood.

166
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:03,389
How did you get in here?

167
00:15:04,701 --> 00:15:08,159
It's a little skill
I picked up in Chino.

168
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:10,172
I did a nickel
for attempted murder.

169
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:14,269
You didn't know
I was an ex-con?

170
00:15:14,344 --> 00:15:17,245
Yeah,
nobody at work did.

171
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:19,805
Not until this F.B.I.
murder investigation...

172
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:21,817
whipped everybody up
into a froth.

173
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:30,088
Derwood,
what can I do for you?

174
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,822
You know I got fired
last night?

175
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:37,229
Stupid little
pissant job,

176
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:39,359
where they make you wear
a paper hat.

177
00:15:39,436 --> 00:15:41,802
And they fired me.
Plus, as far as that, uh,

178
00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:44,170
redheaded F.B. I agent's
concerned,

179
00:15:44,241 --> 00:15:46,175
I'm the prime suspect
in this murder.

180
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,872
But that's no skin off my nose,
seeing as you did it.

181
00:16:00,924 --> 00:16:02,789
Diet pills.

182
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,929
Yours, right?

183
00:16:06,997 --> 00:16:10,160
See, I found 'em when
I opened up on Saturday morning.

184
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:14,169
I didn't give 'em back because
I figured, hey, free speed, right?

185
00:16:14,237 --> 00:16:16,705
But then there's this
whole flap about a murder,

186
00:16:16,773 --> 00:16:18,900
and I noticed this.

187
00:16:22,312 --> 00:16:24,246
That ain't ketchup, man.

188
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:28,841
What-What do you want,
Derwood?

189
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:33,683
I don't know.
What do you got?

190
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:37,025
TV, VCR.

191
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:40,392
Nah, it's all crappy,
off-brand stuff.

192
00:16:40,463 --> 00:16:43,591
But, you know, I'll take that,
and whatever money you got in the bank,

193
00:16:43,667 --> 00:16:47,398
and you get this,
and I keep my mouth shut.

194
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:50,371
And just maybe
you can blow town...

195
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,171
before the long arm of the law
reaches out and grabs you by the gonads.

196
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,381
Maybe not.

197
00:17:01,484 --> 00:17:03,384
Cup 'em.

198
00:17:03,453 --> 00:17:05,717
Uh... Hi.

199
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:07,586
Uh, Rob?

200
00:17:07,657 --> 00:17:11,184
I hate to bother you, but last night
in the front of the building,

201
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:13,195
there was a man
in a parked car for hours.

202
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:16,790
Did you happen to see him?
It was a maroon car.

203
00:17:16,866 --> 00:17:18,800
He was pretty clean-cut,
so I didn't call the police.

204
00:17:18,868 --> 00:17:21,701
But he was still there
when I went to bed.

205
00:17:21,771 --> 00:17:24,103
Gee, Sylvia, I don't know
what to tell you.

206
00:17:24,174 --> 00:17:27,701
Well, he's gone now, but just,
you know, keep your eyes out
in case he comes back.

207
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:29,711
- You got it.
- Thanks.

208
00:17:34,284 --> 00:17:36,377
- So I'll call you tonight
and let you know...

209
00:17:36,453 --> 00:17:38,978
where to drop off
my new VCR.

210
00:17:41,124 --> 00:17:44,651
Oh. And don't try
skipping town.

211
00:17:44,728 --> 00:17:47,253
You won't get too far.

212
00:18:01,444 --> 00:18:04,572
Hey, just the man
I wanted to see.

213
00:18:04,647 --> 00:18:06,581
How are you
this morning, Rob?

214
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:09,777
- Fine.
- Yeah. I'm glad I caught you.

215
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:12,253
Oh, hey, I was just
driving to your apartment,

216
00:18:12,322 --> 00:18:14,882
and I saw Derwood Spinks
not a block from here.

217
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:18,587
- He wasn't coming from your place
by any chance, was he?
- No, I haven't seen him.

218
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:22,495
Good. I'd stay away from him. He's
our prime suspect in the Pankow murder.

219
00:18:22,565 --> 00:18:25,830
- You think he did it?
- Me? No. No, I should say...

220
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:29,133
that's the opinion of the
Costa Mesa Police, and my partner.

221
00:18:29,205 --> 00:18:31,196
So he's not your guy?

222
00:18:31,274 --> 00:18:34,368
No. No, I think we're looking for
somebody who has a compulsion to kill.

223
00:18:34,444 --> 00:18:37,470
Truly can't help himself.

224
00:18:37,547 --> 00:18:42,314
Oh, quick question. The, uh... The meat
that you threw in the Dumpster?

225
00:18:42,385 --> 00:18:44,853
- What about it?
- The Dumpster had a padlock.

226
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:46,855
- Yeah.
- Who would have the key?

227
00:18:46,923 --> 00:18:48,857
We do,

228
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:51,189
and the
trucking company does.

229
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:56,861
Hey, wait.
What's your point?

230
00:18:56,933 --> 00:18:59,527
I'm just tying up
some loose ends.

231
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:08,736
Good, you got my message,
Rob. I appreciate your coming.

232
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:12,942
This will be really informal.
Here you go.

233
00:19:13,016 --> 00:19:15,678
I wanna run through
some things with you.

234
00:19:15,752 --> 00:19:19,244
We don't stand on ceremony here,
so if there's anything that
you want to talk about,

235
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:21,313
just go ahead
and blurt it out, okay?

236
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:25,561
Hasn't been a run-of-the-mill week
so far, has it?

237
00:19:25,628 --> 00:19:27,562
No.

238
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,064
The police have been at the restaurant,
and the F.B.I.

239
00:19:30,133 --> 00:19:32,567
I'm sure this has been
a very stressful time for you.

240
00:19:32,635 --> 00:19:34,432
Pretty much.

241
00:19:34,504 --> 00:19:37,268
So we wanna keep on top
of any potential problems...

242
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,399
that these stresses
might cause for you.

243
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:43,537
- So let's run through some
standard questions together.

244
00:19:46,116 --> 00:19:48,744
Rob, have you been troubled
recently by insomnia?

245
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:53,256
- Bad dreams? Nightmares?

246
00:19:53,256 --> 00:19:54,525
Have you felt
emotionally numb?

247
00:19:54,525 --> 00:19:56,390
Have you felt
emotionally numb?

248
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:01,193
Do you ever see things
that aren't there, or hear voices?

249
00:20:07,938 --> 00:20:11,271
- Tell me, Rob, do you feel...
- This...

250
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:14,538
This murder...
This murder that happened?

251
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:16,044
Yes?

252
00:20:18,215 --> 00:20:20,649
What kind of a monster
would do something like that?

253
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,653
I don't believe
in monsters.

254
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,749
But I do believe
in people.

255
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:30,816
And sometimes,
they do terrible things...

256
00:20:30,894 --> 00:20:34,330
out of weakness
or sickness or fear.

257
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:38,829
But I do truly believe
that deep down inside,

258
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:41,063
even the worst of us
wants to be good.

259
00:20:41,138 --> 00:20:46,132
Rob, is there anything that's troubling
you that you'd like to talk about?

260
00:20:50,714 --> 00:20:53,308
I'm sorry.
I thought I put that on voice mail.

261
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:59,447
Mindy Reinhart.

262
00:20:59,523 --> 00:21:01,684
Yes, Agent Mulder.
What can I do for you?

263
00:21:04,027 --> 00:21:07,190
No, I'm afraid
I can't do that.

264
00:21:07,264 --> 00:21:11,132
I'm sorry, but it would violate
patient confidentiality.

265
00:21:11,201 --> 00:21:13,135
I, uh...

266
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:15,763
Excuse me, Agent...
Rob?

267
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:19,104
Yeah? I have to
go to work now.

268
00:21:19,176 --> 00:21:22,236
Would you please call me later
so that we can finish our talk?

269
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:42,156
You shouldn't be here, Derwood.
We would've mailed you your last check.

270
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:44,166
Just give me
my money, Rice.

271
00:21:56,213 --> 00:21:58,147
How you doin', killer?

272
00:21:58,215 --> 00:22:00,547
You better have some money
for me too, huh?

273
00:22:00,617 --> 00:22:03,677
There.
Now please leave.

274
00:22:03,754 --> 00:22:06,018
With pleasure, pal.

275
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:08,319
Oh, I ought to just make
happy hour.

276
00:22:10,093 --> 00:22:14,496
Since this is farewell,
when nobody was looking,

277
00:22:14,564 --> 00:22:16,828
I used to dip my boys
in the coleslaw.

278
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,834
- Ew!
- Ew!

279
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:21,200
Bon appétit.

280
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,734
If somebody's still in here,
you're in a world of hurt!

281
00:23:46,723 --> 00:23:49,157
Rob?

282
00:23:54,498 --> 00:23:56,432
You lookin' for these?

283
00:23:58,235 --> 00:24:00,169
The deal's off, buddy.

284
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:06,641
You know that guy
you iced, Pankow?

285
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:09,406
I just heard he didn't have
a brain in his head.

286
00:24:11,548 --> 00:24:14,142
You're one sick
little freak, man.

287
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:18,016
You got a lot of problems.

288
00:24:21,057 --> 00:24:22,991
If I were the F.B.I.,

289
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,993
I'd want you real bad.

290
00:24:27,063 --> 00:24:29,588
Public enemy number one
and all that.

291
00:24:29,666 --> 00:24:31,600
Lots of reward money.

292
00:24:33,904 --> 00:24:35,895
So I'm gonna
turn you in myself,

293
00:24:35,972 --> 00:24:37,906
"lucky boy. "

294
00:25:10,672 --> 00:25:12,606
- Rob.
- Hi.

295
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:15,108
You said we should
finish talking.

296
00:25:15,177 --> 00:25:16,804
Come in.

297
00:25:26,688 --> 00:25:29,782
- I think I need help.
- Tell me why you think that.

298
00:25:30,959 --> 00:25:33,120
I have compulsions
to eat.

299
00:25:33,195 --> 00:25:37,097
I-I get hungry. And I try to
put it off for as long as I can,

300
00:25:37,165 --> 00:25:41,397
but then finally, I just... I get so
hungry that I can't help myself, and...

301
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,904
You binge, then purge?

302
00:25:43,972 --> 00:25:47,635
You eat too much,
and then cause yourself to vomit?

303
00:25:50,579 --> 00:25:53,207
No.
I just eat.

304
00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:56,308
But this makes you feel bad.

305
00:25:56,385 --> 00:25:59,684
I guess it makes me feel
like I'm not a good person.

306
00:25:59,755 --> 00:26:03,657
Rob, there are so many
different kinds of eating disorders.

307
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:06,159
Men and women from every walk
of life suffer from them.

308
00:26:06,228 --> 00:26:10,722
But if there's one thing that they all
have in common, it's low self-esteem.

309
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:14,394
And it's a shame because low self-esteem
can be like a fun house mirror.

310
00:26:14,469 --> 00:26:19,202
It reflects back
a warped and ugly image of ourselves.

311
00:26:19,274 --> 00:26:22,573
What do you think Cindy Crawford would
look like in a fun house mirror?

312
00:26:22,644 --> 00:26:24,874
Uh, weird?

313
00:26:26,748 --> 00:26:30,184
- Ugly.
- And how would the most
handsome man in the world look?

314
00:26:30,252 --> 00:26:33,744
How would, say, PeterJennings
look in a fun house mirror?

315
00:26:33,822 --> 00:26:38,020
- Ugly.
- And how do you look...

316
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:40,926
in this mirror?

317
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:44,295
Do you think that looks
like a bad person?

318
00:26:44,366 --> 00:26:47,858
An unworthy person?
I'll tell you what I see.

319
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:50,871
I see a nice smile.

320
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:52,873
I see soulful brown eyes.

321
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:55,432
I see good.

322
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:58,001
Now, Rob, I want you
to keep looking into this mirror...

323
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,048
until you see
the same things that I do.

324
00:27:02,217 --> 00:27:04,777
There's a meeting that
I'd like you to attend tonight.

325
00:27:04,853 --> 00:27:06,878
It's every Monday,
Wednesday and Friday.

326
00:27:06,955 --> 00:27:09,480
Now, you can talk to me
anytime you want.

327
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:12,493
But these people are the best.
They can really help you.

328
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:30,203
- I have to go.
- You always hurry away.

329
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,514
I appreciate it,

330
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:36,779
and I want you
to understand...

331
00:27:36,852 --> 00:27:39,252
that I really am trying
to do right.

332
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,054
- Hey, Rob, you didn't tell me
you had a friend in the F.B.I.
- What?

333
00:28:16,124 --> 00:28:20,026
He's upstairs. I told him all about
that strange man in the maroon car,

334
00:28:20,095 --> 00:28:22,325
and he said
he'd look into it.

335
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,334
Afternoon, Rob.

336
00:28:28,603 --> 00:28:31,970
Sir, may we speak with you?

337
00:28:34,009 --> 00:28:36,034
Derwood Spinks
has disappeared.

338
00:28:36,111 --> 00:28:39,080
His car is gone,
along with some personal belongings.

339
00:28:39,147 --> 00:28:42,605
My partner saw Spinks in your
neighborhood yesterday morning.

340
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:45,653
At that time, you told Agent Mulder
that you hadn't seen Mr. Spinks.

341
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,518
Is that correct?

342
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,751
I don't even know him
that well.

343
00:28:50,826 --> 00:28:54,193
If he was going to leave town,
he wouldn't come tell me about it.

344
00:28:54,262 --> 00:28:57,857
Who said he left town?

345
00:28:57,933 --> 00:29:01,733
I don't know. Isn't that
what you think happened?

346
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:04,636
No, no. Uh, personally,
I think he's dead.

347
00:29:04,706 --> 00:29:08,198
I can't speak for my partner,
but I think that whatever it was...

348
00:29:08,276 --> 00:29:12,076
that killed Donald Pankow
also got to Mr. Derwood Spinks.

349
00:29:13,348 --> 00:29:15,282
What do... What do you mean,
whatever it was?

350
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:18,911
Well, I'll let you in
on a little secret.

351
00:29:18,987 --> 00:29:21,046
We've been able to keep it
pretty quiet up until now,

352
00:29:21,123 --> 00:29:23,751
but Donald Pankow's brain
was missing from his skull.

353
00:29:23,825 --> 00:29:26,726
My partner was able to find something
that was previously undetected.

354
00:29:26,795 --> 00:29:28,854
It was the tip of what
could only be described...

355
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:31,592
as a tiny shark's tooth
embedded deep in the bone.

356
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:36,565
I think we're looking for
some kind of genetic freak...

357
00:29:36,638 --> 00:29:39,004
a carnivorous predator
as yet unidentified.

358
00:29:39,074 --> 00:29:41,235
A monster, if you will.

359
00:29:43,111 --> 00:29:45,045
There's no such thing.

360
00:29:45,113 --> 00:29:48,810
Well, don't you believe it.
This thing definitely qualifies.

361
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:50,818
It has a biological
imperative to eat.

362
00:29:50,886 --> 00:29:53,286
I think it even ate
that ground chuck you threw away.

363
00:29:53,355 --> 00:29:55,823
Yeah? Why?

364
00:29:55,891 --> 00:29:59,122
Because it can't kill with impunity,
and it knows it.

365
00:29:59,194 --> 00:30:03,332
It knows that the more
it feeds on humans,
the closer it gets to getting caught.

366
00:30:03,465 --> 00:30:05,831
But the hunger
is always there,

367
00:30:05,901 --> 00:30:07,994
and it satisfies it
anyway it can.

368
00:30:13,442 --> 00:30:15,376
I'm-I'm sorry,

369
00:30:15,444 --> 00:30:19,346
but this is like
good cop, insane cop.

370
00:30:21,183 --> 00:30:24,448
Why are you telling me
all of this?

371
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:26,646
I think you know why.

372
00:30:28,056 --> 00:30:30,286
Thank you, Mr. Roberts.

373
00:30:30,359 --> 00:30:32,691
We'll contact you
if we have any further questions.

374
00:30:37,432 --> 00:30:39,366
Watch out for that monster.

375
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:05,626
Devil's food,
with the white sugar frosting.

376
00:31:05,694 --> 00:31:08,492
And it is, like,
"Deliver me from evil. "

377
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:11,691
Come on in.

378
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:14,065
Come on. So,

379
00:31:14,136 --> 00:31:16,070
I baked
three dozen of these...

380
00:31:16,138 --> 00:31:18,606
for my daughter's
school fund-raiser.

381
00:31:18,673 --> 00:31:22,473
And at 3:00 in the morning
the night before there they are,

382
00:31:22,544 --> 00:31:25,012
all three dozen of'em,

383
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,344
lined up
and calling to me.

384
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:29,350
- Well, you know, in the past,

385
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:33,252
there would have been a good chance
I would've gone through
every single last one of them.

386
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:35,255
Small world, huh?

387
00:31:36,892 --> 00:31:39,656
Is this your first time
at a meeting?

388
00:31:39,728 --> 00:31:41,662
- Yeah.

389
00:31:46,168 --> 00:31:48,796
Does anybody else have anything
they want to share?

390
00:31:50,872 --> 00:31:54,535
Do you feel up to introducing yourself?
Everybody's really nice.

391
00:31:54,609 --> 00:31:57,407
- Anyone?
- Don't be scared. It helped me.

392
00:32:15,664 --> 00:32:17,598
Uh, hi.

393
00:32:17,666 --> 00:32:21,193
My name is
Robert Roberts.

394
00:32:21,269 --> 00:32:23,203
People...
People call me Rob.

395
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:25,762
Hi, Rob!

396
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:27,775
I-I have
an eating disorder.

397
00:32:27,843 --> 00:32:31,040
I'm definitely
a meat eater,

398
00:32:31,112 --> 00:32:33,046
not a vegetarian.

399
00:32:33,114 --> 00:32:38,518
I've always had these cravings...
my whole life.

400
00:32:38,587 --> 00:32:41,078
And just-just recently,

401
00:32:41,156 --> 00:32:44,614
the last month or so,

402
00:32:44,693 --> 00:32:47,059
they've just become
too powerful to resist.

403
00:32:47,128 --> 00:32:49,062
Tell us about it.

404
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:53,226
I guess it's the taste
I respond to the most.

405
00:32:54,569 --> 00:32:57,800
Salty and... juicy.

406
00:32:57,873 --> 00:32:59,807
Kind of buttery.

407
00:32:59,875 --> 00:33:04,812
- The texture of it
inside of your mouth...

408
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,213
You know, your teeth
just sink into it...

409
00:33:08,283 --> 00:33:11,480
like this juicy cloud.

410
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:13,851
And it tastes so good.

411
00:33:13,922 --> 00:33:16,186
You know, you don't even
wanna swallow it.

412
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:18,818
You just wanna work it
around your taste buds...

413
00:33:18,894 --> 00:33:22,489
until your eyes roll
right back into your head.

414
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:28,601
Do you remember when
I first came here?

415
00:33:45,253 --> 00:33:48,814
Anyway, it's a real problem.

416
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:54,453
Wait.
Your ex-husband did what?

417
00:33:54,529 --> 00:33:57,362
He said I was too fat
to ride in his sports car...

418
00:33:57,432 --> 00:34:00,196
that I'd just
mess up the springs.

419
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:03,396
So I sat on the hood
and I bounced.

420
00:34:05,206 --> 00:34:08,107
And I didn't stop
until the police showed up.

421
00:34:08,176 --> 00:34:10,110
They sided with me.

422
00:34:11,146 --> 00:34:14,013
Hey, thank you, Sylvia.

423
00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:16,016
Good night, Rob.

424
00:34:17,419 --> 00:34:19,910
Good night, Sylvia.

425
00:34:50,552 --> 00:34:52,486
I'll be right there.

426
00:35:57,351 --> 00:35:59,979
What the hell is going on?

427
00:36:00,054 --> 00:36:03,512
Oh, my God!
Call the police!

428
00:36:03,591 --> 00:36:05,616
Everything okay?

429
00:36:14,301 --> 00:36:16,895
Mr. Derwood Spinks,
alive and well.

430
00:36:19,673 --> 00:36:23,200
You know what, folks? Why don't we
go outside and talk about it there.

431
00:36:25,446 --> 00:36:27,641
I'm confused, Rob.

432
00:36:27,715 --> 00:36:29,649
Was he helping you
redecorate?

433
00:36:31,318 --> 00:36:34,014
- I lied to you before.
- About what?

434
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:36,386
Derwood was...

435
00:36:36,457 --> 00:36:40,120
was coming from my place
the morning you saw him.

436
00:36:40,194 --> 00:36:43,095
He said if I spoke to you,
he'd kill me.

437
00:36:43,164 --> 00:36:46,031
What didn't he want you
to tell us?

438
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,034
Last Friday night,

439
00:36:48,102 --> 00:36:50,935
he hung out while I was
cleaning out the freezer.

440
00:36:52,406 --> 00:36:55,898
He told me to go home,
said he'd finish up.

441
00:36:55,976 --> 00:37:00,379
You know, I... I didn't know why
the hell he was being so nice to me.

442
00:37:00,448 --> 00:37:03,246
But when I got home,

443
00:37:03,317 --> 00:37:07,617
I realized I had the key
to the Dumpster.

444
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:09,622
And when I drove back,

445
00:37:11,392 --> 00:37:14,884
I saw him cleaning up
all this blood.

446
00:37:14,962 --> 00:37:16,793
You must have been
very scared.

447
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:21,392
I was, but you know, I should have
told the truth from the start.

448
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:23,767
Do you recognize
this guy?

449
00:37:30,211 --> 00:37:32,304
- No.
- Hmm.

450
00:37:32,379 --> 00:37:35,507
He's a private eye.
Sylvia Jassie's ex-husband...

451
00:37:35,583 --> 00:37:37,517
hired him to spy on her.

452
00:37:38,919 --> 00:37:41,717
But now this Steve Kiziak
is gone missing.

453
00:37:41,789 --> 00:37:44,519
He was last seen
parked outside your apartment.

454
00:37:44,592 --> 00:37:46,526
You didn't notice him?

455
00:37:46,594 --> 00:37:49,392
No, I-I didn't...
notice anything.

456
00:37:51,832 --> 00:37:53,766
Well, maybe we should check
with Sylvia again.

457
00:37:53,834 --> 00:37:56,701
I don't...
I don't think she's home.

458
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,261
Ah, well,
we'll track her down.

459
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:05,371
Don't worry, Rob.
It won't be long now.

460
00:38:21,028 --> 00:38:22,962
Oh, my God.

461
00:38:23,864 --> 00:38:26,856
Rob?
What happened?

462
00:38:28,269 --> 00:38:30,794
It's a long story.

463
00:38:30,871 --> 00:38:33,203
What do...
What do you want?

464
00:38:33,274 --> 00:38:36,402
I, uh... I was in the neighborhood,
and I thought I'd say hi.

465
00:38:38,946 --> 00:38:42,905
- Hi.
- Rob, are you all right?

466
00:38:47,721 --> 00:38:49,655
Did you do this?

467
00:38:51,025 --> 00:38:55,052
No!
Derwood Spinks did this.

468
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:57,791
You know,
he's the one who...

469
00:38:57,865 --> 00:38:59,799
Like I said,
it's a long story.

470
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:02,267
Where are you going?

471
00:39:02,336 --> 00:39:04,566
To a friend's house.

472
00:39:04,638 --> 00:39:08,506
I have to leave, actually,
as in now.

473
00:39:08,576 --> 00:39:10,976
Are you sure you're all right?
You're not feeling...

474
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:13,775
Yes, absolutely.
I'm-I'm fine, you know?

475
00:39:13,847 --> 00:39:15,781
It's just that when you came
to see me yesterday,

476
00:39:15,849 --> 00:39:18,647
I sensed that there were things that
you wanted to talk about, but couldn't.

477
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,022
That was yesterday.

478
00:39:25,192 --> 00:39:27,195
Well, can we talk
about them now?

479
00:39:27,328 --> 00:39:30,695
Look, let me stop you
right there, okay?

480
00:39:30,765 --> 00:39:33,996
You don't have to worry
about me anymore.

481
00:39:34,068 --> 00:39:37,196
As of...
As of 10:38 a.m.,

482
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:40,502
I am no longer employed by
the Lucky Boy Corporation.

483
00:39:40,575 --> 00:39:43,669
- I quit.
- Rob.

484
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:45,678
I'm here as a friend.

485
00:39:45,746 --> 00:39:48,180
Well, then,
consider me cured.

486
00:39:48,249 --> 00:39:50,240
I had a breakthrough
last night.

487
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:52,878
- Did you attend the O.A. meeting?
- Yeah.

488
00:39:52,954 --> 00:39:56,822
- How did it go?
- It was a complete
and utter waste of my time.

489
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:58,950
I'm sorry
you felt that way.

490
00:39:59,026 --> 00:40:01,017
So they're a bunch
of fat people.

491
00:40:01,095 --> 00:40:04,030
So what?
M-M-Maybe they, got, uh,

492
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:06,931
what you would call
a biological imperative...

493
00:40:07,001 --> 00:40:09,026
to eat too much.

494
00:40:09,103 --> 00:40:13,039
Did you ever think
of that? Did you?

495
00:40:13,107 --> 00:40:18,568
You know, maybe I've got
a biological imperative too.

496
00:40:18,646 --> 00:40:21,080
So why is that
such a bad thing?

497
00:40:21,148 --> 00:40:25,016
Like, the world's gonna end?
That is biology.

498
00:40:25,086 --> 00:40:28,419
You can't fight biology.
You can't.

499
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:33,153
- Sounds like you're saying
you're tired of feeling guilty.
- Bingo.

500
00:40:33,227 --> 00:40:35,218
And I am sick and tired...

501
00:40:35,296 --> 00:40:37,526
of pretending that
I'm something that I'm not.

502
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:43,203
You killed that man,
didn't you?

503
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:56,449
What did you just say?

504
00:40:56,517 --> 00:40:58,747
That's why you feel
so guilty, isn't it?

505
00:41:00,988 --> 00:41:03,513
Can you tell me why
you did it?

506
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:07,755
- Who have you been talking to?
- No one.

507
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:10,194
I realized it
after our last session.

508
00:41:10,264 --> 00:41:13,995
- You spoke to the F.B.I., didn't you?
- I haven't spoken to anyone.

509
00:41:14,068 --> 00:41:16,434
And I won't without your permission,
but I am here...

510
00:41:16,504 --> 00:41:19,439
- To ask you to turn yourself in.

511
00:41:19,507 --> 00:41:22,374
I want you to get
the help that you need.

512
00:41:31,652 --> 00:41:34,951
- You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

513
00:41:35,022 --> 00:41:36,956
Yes, I do, Rob.

514
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,787
No, you don't!

515
00:41:41,262 --> 00:41:43,196
You said...

516
00:41:43,264 --> 00:41:45,528
you don't believe
in monsters.

517
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:48,466
Right?

518
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:52,028
How about...

519
00:41:52,106 --> 00:41:54,040
now?

520
00:41:59,213 --> 00:42:01,147
How about...

521
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:06,548
now?

522
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,112
Do you believe...
in monsters?

523
00:42:18,999 --> 00:42:21,524
You poor man.

524
00:42:23,971 --> 00:42:25,905
What you must go through.

525
00:42:37,351 --> 00:42:39,819
- Oh, my God.
- Step away, Rob.

526
00:42:41,622 --> 00:42:44,056
- Step away.
- Dr. Reinhart, step away from him.

527
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,686
- Don't hurt him.
- Rob, we tracked Sylvia down
on the way to the landfill.

528
00:42:47,762 --> 00:42:50,128
You just can't
stop yourself, can you?

529
00:42:51,298 --> 00:42:53,391
Get on the floor.

530
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:56,527
Rob, get on the floor!

531
00:42:57,872 --> 00:43:00,568
Rob.

532
00:43:00,641 --> 00:43:03,405
Be that good person
I know you mean to be.

533
00:43:33,641 --> 00:43:35,575
Why?

534
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:41,708
I can't be something
I'm not.
