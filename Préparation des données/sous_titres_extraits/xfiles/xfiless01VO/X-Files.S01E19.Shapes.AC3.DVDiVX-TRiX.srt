1
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:04,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(thunder pealing)

2
00:00:21,368 --> 00:00:26,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(animal howling)

3
00:00:31,378 --> 00:00:36,839  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(neighing, mooing)

4
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:31,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(animal roaring outside)

5
00:01:37,444 --> 00:01:39,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(growling)

6
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,447  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(screams)

7
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,882  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(growls, yells)

8
00:02:51,618 --> 00:02:54,451  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm not a killer.

9
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:56,614  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I never meant
to hurt no one.

10
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,091  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm tired ofmy cattle
being butchered.

11
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's the fourth one
this month.

12
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:04,254  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who orwhat
doyou thinkwas responsible?

13
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:06,389  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That cow looked
like a piece ofpaper

14
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,434  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that went
through a shredder.

15
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,470  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No animal
could do that.

16
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:12,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then areyou saying
that a person

17
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:14,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
was responsible for this?

18
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:17,737  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want to remind you
Mr. Parker is free on bond

19
00:03:17,811 --> 00:03:19,278  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
pending trial.

20
00:03:19,346 --> 00:03:20,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's willfully speaking

21
00:03:20,881 --> 00:03:22,746  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
solely in regards
to this incident

22
00:03:22,816 --> 00:03:25,444  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and not about other
litigation.

23
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,783  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We can't talk
about Mr. Parker's case

24
00:03:27,854 --> 00:03:29,788  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
against the Trego
lndian Reservation?

25
00:03:29,856 --> 00:03:31,551  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's exactlywhat I mean.

26
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:34,025  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Wait a second.

27
00:03:34,127 --> 00:03:36,095  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This ain't the time
for lawyer crap.

28
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:37,527  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want to get
this in the open.

29
00:03:37,597 --> 00:03:39,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You think I killed
an lndian

30
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:43,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
because we're having an argument
about where my land ends?

31
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:45,297  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We want to settle
in court.

32
00:03:45,372 --> 00:03:49,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
joseph Goodensnake is dead
with a wound from your shotgun.

33
00:03:51,077 --> 00:03:55,207  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All I'm saying, it was
no animal I know of.

34
00:03:55,282 --> 00:03:57,876  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But it damn well didn't
seem human, neither.

35
00:03:57,951 --> 00:03:59,816  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take a look
at my boy's scars.

36
00:04:03,056 --> 00:04:05,047  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was dark.

37
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:07,889  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We heard a growl. We went
out to protect the cattle.

38
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:12,931  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I could have swore I saw...
red eyes and fangs.

39
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:18,767  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I thought my boy Lyle was...

40
00:04:20,106 --> 00:04:22,631  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Look, nobody--nobody--

41
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:25,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
was more shocked and upset
than I was

42
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:27,375  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to find out
it was thatyoung lndian boy

43
00:04:27,447 --> 00:04:29,381  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but ifhe killed
our cattle--

44
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:33,146  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm very sorry that we had
to find out about it that way

45
00:04:33,219 --> 00:04:35,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but as far as I'm concerned
that's the end ofit.

46
00:04:37,624 --> 00:04:38,955  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Can we see the corral?

47
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,583  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll takeyou
out there.

48
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,563  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Agent Mulder?

49
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:47,065  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah?

50
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,101  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Agent Scully...

51
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:51,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I suppose ifl were hearing
our side ofthe story

52
00:04:51,805 --> 00:04:55,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
it might not hold up too well--

53
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:57,905  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
parts I don't understand
myself--

54
00:04:57,978 --> 00:05:00,606  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
things my father could never try
to explain to a stranger.

55
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,942  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What kinds ofthings?

56
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
For the last few months

57
00:05:05,085 --> 00:05:08,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
wheneverwe'd go outside
at night to check the cattle

58
00:05:08,421 --> 00:05:10,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
we never saw anything
out ofthe ordinary--

59
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:12,391  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
not a mountain lion,
not a coyote

60
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
not even anyTregoes,
Agent Scully...

61
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:20,797  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but I can feel it--

62
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,562  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
something not human--

63
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:25,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
out there...

64
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:27,830  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
watching me.

65
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:31,809  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The airwas more still.

66
00:05:31,878 --> 00:05:34,540  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The night animals
more quiet.

67
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:37,913  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was like nature herself
was terrified.

68
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:41,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gave me the creeps.

69
00:05:41,388 --> 00:05:42,650  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The creeps?

70
00:05:42,722 --> 00:05:45,987  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yeah. The creeps.

71
00:05:46,059 --> 00:05:47,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don'tyou ever get the creeps?

72
00:05:58,071 --> 00:06:00,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The victim was shot there

73
00:06:00,874 --> 00:06:04,002  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
about three meters
from where Parker fired.

74
00:06:05,612 --> 00:06:08,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's no way he could have
mistaken a person for an animal.

75
00:06:08,782 --> 00:06:12,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's open-and-shut,
Mulder.

76
00:06:12,452 --> 00:06:14,386  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know, I'm surprised
you volunteered

77
00:06:14,454 --> 00:06:17,048  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for this assignment.

78
00:06:17,123 --> 00:06:20,786  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Any Bureau agent could have investigated
this reservation homicide.

79
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,885  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why areyou
interested?

80
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:51,413  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, there seems to be
nothing unexplainable

81
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:53,015  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
about this case.

82
00:06:53,093 --> 00:06:54,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Nope.

83
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:57,061  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not a thing.

84
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:03,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is so odd.

85
00:07:03,937 --> 00:07:05,768  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's almost like a snakeskin
that's been shed.

86
00:07:05,839 --> 00:07:09,969  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I suspect the Parkers
knowingly killed Goodensnake.

87
00:07:10,043 --> 00:07:11,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They hardly seem the type
to skin theirvictim.

88
00:07:12,011 --> 00:07:15,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Police and coroner's report
make no mention ofsuch an act.

89
00:07:16,049 --> 00:07:20,042  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully:
We'll have to look
at the body ourselves.

90
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,055  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder:
The body's been transferred
to reservation authorities.

91
00:07:23,123 --> 00:07:25,114  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're supposed
to get in touch

92
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:27,091  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
with a SheriffTskany.

93
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:10,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Excuse me.
We're not from around here.

94
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:12,801  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're looking
for SheriffTskany.

95
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:24,244  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anyone know CharleyTskany?

96
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:26,649  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Man:
Go home, F.B.I.

97
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:30,851  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How did you know?

98
00:08:30,957 --> 00:08:33,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I could smell you
a mile away.

99
00:08:33,393 --> 00:08:36,829  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, they told me that even though
my deodorant's made for a woman

100
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:38,591  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
it's strong enough
for a man.

101
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:46,729  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was at Wounded Knee in 1 973.

102
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:50,936  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What I learned
fighting the F.B.I. is

103
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:54,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you don't believe in us,
and we don't believe in you.

104
00:08:54,981 --> 00:08:58,041  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I want to believe.

105
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:03,613  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whyyou here?
What areyou looking for?

106
00:09:03,723 --> 00:09:06,055  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know
what we're looking for.

107
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,752  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You tell me what I know.

108
00:09:07,861 --> 00:09:10,227  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're looking
for information

109
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:12,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
on the homicide
ofJoe Goodensnake.

110
00:09:12,632 --> 00:09:14,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We're looking for anything

111
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,564  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that can create human tracks
in one step

112
00:09:16,636 --> 00:09:18,604  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and animal tracks
in the next.

113
00:09:18,671 --> 00:09:24,268  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Parker. He found
whatyou're looking for.

114
00:09:24,344 --> 00:09:27,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He killed
whatyou're looking for, F.B.I.

115
00:09:29,349 --> 00:09:31,283  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Parker and his kid killed
my brother.

116
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:33,342  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're all too afraid
ofsome stupid lndian legend

117
00:09:33,419 --> 00:09:34,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to do anything.

118
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:36,421  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gwen!

119
00:09:36,522 --> 00:09:38,820  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The suits come
when theywant something

120
00:09:38,892 --> 00:09:40,325  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but when we need help

121
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:43,122  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
they're nowhere to be found.

122
00:09:49,569 --> 00:09:51,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
SheriffTskany?

123
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:57,106  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm Agent Scully
and this is Agent Mulder.

124
00:09:57,176 --> 00:10:01,306  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Goodensnake's body
is in my office.

125
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,832  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bill, Tom.

126
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,562  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let them through.

127
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:27,333  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Come on, boys.
Let them through.

128
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:36,012  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Who are they?

129
00:10:36,082 --> 00:10:38,016  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Guardians ofthe dead.

130
00:10:38,084 --> 00:10:42,487  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They escort the deceased
spirits to the new world.

131
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:45,113  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I let them
as far as the front door.

132
00:10:45,224 --> 00:10:49,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I keep ancient beliefs out there
and police work in here.

133
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:51,029  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The woman in the pool hall

134
00:10:51,097 --> 00:10:53,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
said people were afraid
ofsome legend.

135
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:55,658  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What do they believe happened?

136
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:57,703  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm not a park ranger

137
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:59,601  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
here to answer questions
about lndians.

138
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:02,766  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Whenever I need federal help
I never get it.

139
00:11:02,842 --> 00:11:04,776  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Since this case falls

140
00:11:04,844 --> 00:11:07,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
under thejurisdiction
ofthe F.B.I.

141
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:09,813  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you're entitled to examine
the body.

142
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:12,146  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So let's get it overwith.

143
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,115  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder:
Was the woman in the pool hall
his sister?

144
00:11:20,226 --> 00:11:22,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gwen. She andJoe
are primarily responsible

145
00:11:23,062 --> 00:11:25,326  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for fueling the boundary
dispute with Parker.

146
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:27,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They felt
he had been grazing his cattle

147
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,130  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
farther and father
onto the reservation.

148
00:11:30,203 --> 00:11:33,536  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Parker probably told you it was
his idea to settle in court.

149
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:36,336  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
joe and Gwen
filed the suit.

150
00:11:38,578 --> 00:11:40,603  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Take a look
at that scar tissue.

151
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Looks like he had been attacked
by an animal as well.

152
00:11:44,617 --> 00:11:46,949  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tskany:
CouldJoe have been
attacked also?

153
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:49,682  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe the Parkers
did see an animal.

154
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,450  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No. Those wounds

155
00:11:51,557 --> 00:11:54,958  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
have been healing
for quite some time.

156
00:11:55,028 --> 00:11:58,395  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The shotgun wound indicates
point-blank range.

157
00:11:58,464 --> 00:12:02,264  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The pellets entered the body
in a single mass.

158
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:05,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The assailant couldn't have been
more than three feet away.

159
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:08,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We need to take a look
at Goodensnake's dental records.

160
00:12:24,023 --> 00:12:26,651  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
These are the canine cuspids.
They're normal.

161
00:12:26,726 --> 00:12:29,661  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Could his records
have been switched?

162
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:31,730  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The second incisor
is chipped

163
00:12:31,798 --> 00:12:33,732  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
just like the ones
in his mouth.

164
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
These match
joe Goodensnake's.

165
00:12:36,302 --> 00:12:39,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There are cases
ofcalcium phosphate salts

166
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:40,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
developing abnormally
with age but...

167
00:12:41,007 --> 00:12:43,532  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That could account forwhatJim Parker
claims to have seen.

168
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,543  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was out that night

169
00:12:45,611 --> 00:12:48,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
expecting to see
a mountain lion.

170
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:51,306  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He gets rattled and the fashlight beam
catchesJoe here.

171
00:12:51,384 --> 00:12:53,818  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Parker saw what
he wanted to see-- an animal.

172
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:56,081  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lyle has scars
just likeJoe.

173
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,487  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou have a facility
for an autopsy?

174
00:12:58,558 --> 00:13:00,549  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why?

175
00:13:00,626 --> 00:13:03,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
IfJoe's teeth are abnormal,
an autopsy might reveal

176
00:13:03,396 --> 00:13:06,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
abnormalities in the interior
ofhis anatomy.

177
00:13:07,233 --> 00:13:10,168  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't allow that.

178
00:13:19,378 --> 00:13:21,403  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm fully qualified.

179
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:25,178  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No. The funeral is tonight.

180
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,617  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's a cremation.
After that we'll have nothing.

181
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:30,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tregoes believe that
the recent dead are unsettled

182
00:13:30,289 --> 00:13:32,416  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
by their new condition
as spirits.

183
00:13:32,492 --> 00:13:35,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Any desecration ofthe body
angers the spirit

184
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:37,153  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and keeps it haunting
this world.

185
00:13:37,263 --> 00:13:40,323  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A law enforcement officer
can't destroy evidence.

186
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,867  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Don't tell me what I can't do.

187
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:44,630  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Native Americans believe

188
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:47,537  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
there are laws greater than
that ofthe U.S. government.

189
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:49,336  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Iftheywant
joe at rest

190
00:13:49,408 --> 00:13:52,639  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that's the way it's going to be.

191
00:13:52,712 --> 00:13:54,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ifyou want
to make

192
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,741  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
an issue out ofit
with your authorities

193
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:58,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
go right ahead.

194
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:01,719  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Charley, doyou believe

195
00:14:01,787 --> 00:14:03,584  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that the spirit
ofJoe Goodensnake

196
00:14:03,656 --> 00:14:05,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
is in that room?

197
00:14:09,495 --> 00:14:11,622  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
All I know is

198
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:15,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
tomorrow, the day after,
you're going to leave

199
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but I have
to stay here.

200
00:14:18,304 --> 00:14:21,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've got to answer
to these people.

201
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:23,902  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You can continue
your investigation.

202
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:26,376  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're going to have to do it
withoutJoe Goodensnake's body.

203
00:14:48,267 --> 00:14:53,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(man chanting)

204
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:57,208  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully: Since we've been here
you've acted

205
00:14:57,276 --> 00:14:59,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
as ifyou expected to find
every piece ofevidence

206
00:14:59,745 --> 00:15:01,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
we've come across.

207
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:04,545  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What aren't
you telling me?

208
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:06,585  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why are we here?

209
00:15:09,689 --> 00:15:12,180  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A true piece ofhistory,
Scully--

210
00:15:14,427 --> 00:15:16,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The very first X-File

211
00:15:16,529 --> 00:15:20,056  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
initiated by
j. Edgar Hoover himselfin 1 946.

212
00:15:22,602 --> 00:15:24,069  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
During World War Il

213
00:15:24,136 --> 00:15:26,696  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a series ofmurders occurred
in and around the Northwest.

214
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Seven here
in Browning alone.

215
00:15:28,441 --> 00:15:31,638  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Each victim was basically
ripped to shreds

216
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:33,474  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and eaten
as ifby a wild animal.

217
00:15:33,546 --> 00:15:37,073  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
However, many ofthe victims
were found at home

218
00:15:37,149 --> 00:15:39,117  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
as ifthey allowed
their killer to enter.

219
00:15:41,187 --> 00:15:44,486  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In 1 946, police cornered
what they believed to be

220
00:15:44,557 --> 00:15:48,823  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
such an animal in a cabin
in Glacier National Park.

221
00:15:48,894 --> 00:15:50,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They shot it

222
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:53,364  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but when theywent in
to retrieve the carcass

223
00:15:53,432 --> 00:15:55,764  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
they found only the body
of Richard Watkins.

224
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,804  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sounds like
the Parker scenario.

225
00:15:58,904 --> 00:16:00,235  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The murders stopped
thatyear.

226
00:16:00,306 --> 00:16:03,298  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Because the cases were unsolved
and so bizarre

227
00:16:03,376 --> 00:16:05,003  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hoover locked them away

228
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:07,637  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
hoping that people around here
would forget about them.

229
00:16:07,713 --> 00:16:12,616  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This file indicates that
they started again in 1 954.

230
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:18,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And '59, '64, '78,
and now again in '94

231
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:19,847  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but...

232
00:16:19,925 --> 00:16:21,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Here it comes.

233
00:16:21,594 --> 00:16:23,528  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
These animal-man
related murders

234
00:16:23,629 --> 00:16:25,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
predate the oldest X-File
by 1 50 years.

235
00:16:25,965 --> 00:16:28,024  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Members ofthe Lewis and Clark
expedition

236
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:32,070  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
wrote oflndian men who could
change their shape into that ofa wolf.

237
00:16:34,707 --> 00:16:38,700  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What this folder describes
is called lycanthropy.

238
00:16:38,778 --> 00:16:41,212  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's a type ofinsanity

239
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,975  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
in which
an individual believes

240
00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:45,313  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that he can turn into a wolf.

241
00:16:45,384 --> 00:16:49,912  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I mean, no one can physically
change into an animal.

242
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How can youjust
dismiss the evidence--

243
00:17:01,934 --> 00:17:03,526  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the tracks in the mud,
the shredded skin

244
00:17:03,636 --> 00:17:05,695  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
a man with the teeth
ofan animal?

245
00:17:05,771 --> 00:17:07,204  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Even ifyou're right

246
00:17:07,273 --> 00:17:09,707  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
andJoe Goodensnake did somehow
have the ability

247
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:12,710  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to transform physically
into an animal

248
00:17:12,778 --> 00:17:16,077  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
he's dead.
jim Parker shot him.

249
00:17:16,148 --> 00:17:19,083  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
In a couple ofmoments
his bodywill be burned.

250
00:17:19,151 --> 00:17:23,110  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
End ofmystery.

251
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:25,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let's hope so.

252
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,911  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You don't belong here.

253
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:48,241  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gwen...

254
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:52,648  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're around to wrap
upyour investigation.

255
00:17:55,121 --> 00:17:59,353  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
aboutyour brother.

256
00:17:59,392 --> 00:18:02,657  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I feel sad for anyone who loses
a part oftheir family.

257
00:18:02,762 --> 00:18:04,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
A part?

258
00:18:05,064 --> 00:18:07,362  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was mywhole family.

259
00:18:08,868 --> 00:18:10,859  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm it now.

260
00:18:13,773 --> 00:18:16,970  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
As a demonstration
ofsorrow

261
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:19,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm supposed
to give away

262
00:18:19,078 --> 00:18:20,513  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
all my brother's
possessions.

263
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:26,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gwen, I don't know
what to say.

264
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:30,282  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's no big deal.

265
00:18:30,356 --> 00:18:33,382  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He had more possessions
than he had friends.

266
00:18:59,518 --> 00:19:01,452  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I read the report
ofyour investigation

267
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,387  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
into the Goodensnake homicide.

268
00:19:04,457 --> 00:19:07,790  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was very good.
It was thorough, professional.

269
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,557  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But what I want to know
is offthe record.

270
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:14,565  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What doyou think
really happened?

271
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,464  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your explanation,
Agent Mulder

272
00:19:16,569 --> 00:19:18,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
is lying on
that burial platform.

273
00:19:18,437 --> 00:19:21,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Why don'tyoujust accept
that and go home?

274
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:26,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Charley, doyou believe
in shape-shifting?

275
00:19:27,813 --> 00:19:29,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is a funeral.

276
00:19:38,357 --> 00:19:42,418  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(drums beating)

277
00:19:59,378 --> 00:20:04,315  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(man chanting)

278
00:20:07,486 --> 00:20:12,423  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(group chanting)

279
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:21,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(chanting)

280
00:21:00,406 --> 00:21:03,341  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(chanting continues)

281
00:21:30,302 --> 00:21:33,271  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
- Get out!
- I want to show my respects.

282
00:21:33,339 --> 00:21:35,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't wantyour respects.

283
00:21:35,908 --> 00:21:37,842  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wantyour heart to grow cold.

284
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,437  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wantyou to feel
what I'm feeling!

285
00:21:43,949 --> 00:21:46,918  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I thinkyou better
leave, Mr. Parker.

286
00:21:50,189 --> 00:21:52,817  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wish your brother
could be here.

287
00:21:52,891 --> 00:21:55,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wish that more
than anything else.

288
00:22:53,686 --> 00:22:56,621  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(faint growl)

289
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:30,819  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(clinking)

290
00:23:38,230 --> 00:23:41,290  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(growling)

291
00:24:13,398 --> 00:24:14,990  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By the way
the body's been mutilated

292
00:24:15,067 --> 00:24:17,365  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'd say he's been attacked
by a large predator

293
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:19,996  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
or somebodywanted it
to look that way.

294
00:24:20,072 --> 00:24:22,006  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Doyou think
this is retaliation

295
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:23,473  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
for the death
ofJoe Goodensnake?

296
00:24:23,542 --> 00:24:26,033  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know.

297
00:24:27,479 --> 00:24:29,447  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Haveyou talked
to Gwen Goodensnake?

298
00:24:29,515 --> 00:24:31,005  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She seemed pretty upset
last night.

299
00:24:31,116 --> 00:24:34,415  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's gone. Nobody has seen her
since the funeral.

300
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,010  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've put an A.P.B. out on her.

301
00:24:37,623 --> 00:24:39,386  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
And what about Lyle Parker?

302
00:24:39,458 --> 00:24:42,586  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We can't find him either.

303
00:24:42,661 --> 00:24:44,322  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He could be dead
as well.

304
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:49,127  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll take a look around.

305
00:25:31,476 --> 00:25:33,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(growling)

306
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,820  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(growls)

307
00:25:47,893 --> 00:25:50,259  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(scully gasping)

308
00:26:14,553 --> 00:26:17,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
That's not from any animal
I've ever seen.

309
00:26:18,023 --> 00:26:21,220  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sheriff, I think
it's time we had a talk.

310
00:26:23,028 --> 00:26:25,155  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
An exchange ofideas?

311
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Scully: Mulder!

312
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,732  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm taking Lyle
to the hospital.

313
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:42,343  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He's suffering
from exposure.

314
00:26:42,414 --> 00:26:44,746  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When he's been checked out
I'm gonna question him.

315
00:26:55,294 --> 00:26:56,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What areyou hiding?

316
00:26:58,363 --> 00:27:00,263  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I thought it was over.

317
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:01,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Over?

318
00:27:01,667 --> 00:27:03,032  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Is that whyyou wouldn't
allow an autopsy

319
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:04,363  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
onJoe Goodensnake's body?

320
00:27:04,436 --> 00:27:07,269  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You thought it would all end
when he was cremated?

321
00:27:07,339 --> 00:27:09,705  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What wereyou afraid we'd find?

322
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:12,266  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can't tell you

323
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:14,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but I'll takeyou
to somebodywho can.

324
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:33,022  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm ashamed
to say it

325
00:27:33,098 --> 00:27:34,963  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
afterwhat happened
at the funeral.

326
00:27:35,033 --> 00:27:37,695  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I picked up some bourbon

327
00:27:37,769 --> 00:27:40,203  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and I don't remember a thing
after that.

328
00:27:44,509 --> 00:27:46,500  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Sometimes, when I'm down

329
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:48,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I go out to where me and my dad
keep stray animals

330
00:27:48,747 --> 00:27:51,807  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
that wander in on the ranch.

331
00:27:51,917 --> 00:27:54,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I just watch them, you know.
Keeps things in perspective.

332
00:27:56,822 --> 00:27:59,347  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Anyway...

333
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:02,757  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
my mom--
when she was alive--

334
00:28:02,828 --> 00:28:04,762  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
was the one that started keeping
those animals.

335
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:08,129  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I guess I go out there
and think about her too.

336
00:28:09,735 --> 00:28:11,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
God, I must have
been reallywasted

337
00:28:11,737 --> 00:28:14,570  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
to run around there naked.

338
00:28:14,639 --> 00:28:17,506  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You must have thought
I was one ofthose animals.

339
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:24,840  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
When you did go home,
did you talk toyour father?

340
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,977  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No. He'd have been mad
I even went to the funeral.

341
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:34,585  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I... I have...
an image ofhim

342
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:36,957  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
sitting on the front porch

343
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:40,157  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but... I don't remember
talking to him. Why?

344
00:28:42,734 --> 00:28:44,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Your father is dead.

345
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:52,533  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'm sorry.

346
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:55,045  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(sighing)

347
00:28:58,717 --> 00:29:01,982  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It appears as ifhe's been...

348
00:29:02,087 --> 00:29:05,181  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
attacked by an animal, but...

349
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,485  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I suspect it may be homicide.

350
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:11,017  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lyle, I lost my father
recently

351
00:29:11,096 --> 00:29:13,030  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and I know
how overwhelming...

352
00:29:13,098 --> 00:29:14,690  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Was it my fault?

353
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:19,863  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
By going to the funeral

354
00:29:19,938 --> 00:29:22,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
did it anger them
into killing my father?

355
00:29:24,743 --> 00:29:26,404  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know.

356
00:29:29,648 --> 00:29:31,377  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can deal with death.

357
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:36,147  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You know, living on the ranch,
being close to nature and all

358
00:29:36,254 --> 00:29:39,553  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
you see how it all works.
Things are born. Things die.

359
00:29:39,624 --> 00:29:42,593  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Everything else
falls in between.

360
00:29:46,598 --> 00:29:50,125  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But ifl caused it...

361
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:51,897  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Ifl brought it on

362
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,234  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I couldn't, uh...

363
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:56,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I... I...

364
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:16,350  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I saw it once with my own eyes.

365
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:18,555  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It was a long time ago.

366
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:21,224  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It seemed like a dream.

367
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:24,063  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was a boy.

368
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:26,229  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Was that 1 946?

369
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The Watkins case?

370
00:30:29,741 --> 00:30:31,610  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I sense
you're different, F.B.I.

371
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:34,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You're more open
to Native American belief

372
00:30:34,412 --> 00:30:36,209  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
than some Native Americans.

373
00:30:40,352 --> 00:30:44,550  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You even have
an lndian name-- Fox.

374
00:30:44,656 --> 00:30:48,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You should be " Running Fox"
or "Sneaky Fox."

375
00:30:49,794 --> 00:30:52,991  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
just as long
as it's not "Spooky Fox."

376
00:30:53,064 --> 00:30:56,500  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Tell me, lsh--
what did you see?

377
00:31:00,172 --> 00:31:04,438  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watkins had been attacked
by an animal

378
00:31:04,509 --> 00:31:06,477  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
when he was alone in the woods.

379
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:11,548  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His scars healed.
It was forgotten.

380
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,811  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then the murders began.

381
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:17,252  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The Tregoes--

382
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:21,519  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
we realized that Watkins
had been attacked

383
00:31:21,626 --> 00:31:25,084  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
bywhat the Algonquins call
the manitou

384
00:31:27,699 --> 00:31:33,535  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
an evil spirit capable
ofchanging a man into a beast.

385
00:31:33,605 --> 00:31:38,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
To be attacked by a manitou
causes the victim to become one.

386
00:31:40,045 --> 00:31:42,946  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The healed scars
onJoe Goodensnake's body.

387
00:31:43,014 --> 00:31:48,646  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The manitou overtakes a man
by night, not by full moon

388
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,679  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but when its blood lust builds
to uncontrollable level

389
00:31:52,791 --> 00:31:55,385  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
the man changes
to a sickening creature.

390
00:31:55,493 --> 00:32:00,396  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It kills,
releasing a savage energy.

391
00:32:00,465 --> 00:32:05,027  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The man returns to his true self

392
00:32:05,103 --> 00:32:09,130  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
unaware ofwhat has happened.

393
00:32:09,207 --> 00:32:13,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The cycle begins anew
the next day.

394
00:32:13,445 --> 00:32:15,436  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This continues until death.

395
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:18,542  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
One night

396
00:32:18,617 --> 00:32:22,314  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
when I was 1 6 years old

397
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:26,118  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was coming back from fishing
in the Cut Bank Creek.

398
00:32:26,224 --> 00:32:30,718  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I knew a shortcut
behind Watkins' house.

399
00:32:30,829 --> 00:32:34,560  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There was a... a groan.

400
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:39,536  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Not animal, but not human.

401
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:42,869  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I looked into his window.

402
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:47,503  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was covered
in sweat and blood.

403
00:32:47,579 --> 00:32:52,676  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was in a great, great pain.

404
00:32:55,654 --> 00:32:59,954  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His arm--
the skin ripped.

405
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:03,255  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It tore up
and fell to the foor.

406
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:06,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Claws sprang
from his fingernails.

407
00:33:06,564 --> 00:33:09,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He turned, screaming

408
00:33:10,835 --> 00:33:12,826  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and he saw me.

409
00:33:12,904 --> 00:33:18,399  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
His eyes...
his eyes were still human.

410
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:21,309  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
They begged me to kill him

411
00:33:21,379 --> 00:33:23,643  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and ifl had been hunting
and had my gun

412
00:33:23,715 --> 00:33:27,515  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'd have done it
without a second thought.

413
00:33:27,585 --> 00:33:33,285  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But being a boy,
and scared to death

414
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,723  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I ran away.

415
00:33:35,794 --> 00:33:38,262  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Shortly after,
the police killed him.

416
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:40,594  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But the manitou rose again.

417
00:33:41,766 --> 00:33:43,028  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Eightyears later.

418
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:46,762  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
But with Watkins dead

419
00:33:46,838 --> 00:33:48,999  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
how could there have been
an attack by a manitou?

420
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:52,373  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Watkins had a son.

421
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:56,244  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It could be passed
along bloodlines.

422
00:33:56,314 --> 00:33:57,872  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gwen.

423
00:34:00,585 --> 00:34:02,985  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
IfJoe Goodensnake
was this creature

424
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:06,319  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
then perhaps it didn't originate
in him by the first attack

425
00:34:06,424 --> 00:34:08,517  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
but was handed down
through the bloodlines.

426
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:11,959  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gwen could have it also.
Gwen could have killed Parker.

427
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:14,089  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(low metallic clank)

428
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:35,545  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(engine starting)

429
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:38,248  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gwen!

430
00:34:44,329 --> 00:34:48,288  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No, no, no..!

431
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,494  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Charley:
You're under arrest
for stealing lsh's car.

432
00:34:53,338 --> 00:34:55,738  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What happened?
What areyou running from?

433
00:34:55,807 --> 00:34:58,332  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I saw it.

434
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,742  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I saw it kill Parker.

435
00:35:01,813 --> 00:35:03,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Let her up.

436
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,621  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I went there after the funeral.

437
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:14,317  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was going to mess up the kid.

438
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:16,758  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
So I waited.

439
00:35:16,828 --> 00:35:19,262  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Parkerwas on the porch.

440
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:23,130  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Then this thing,
this animal--

441
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:25,328  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, my God!

442
00:35:25,403 --> 00:35:27,337  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(sobbing)

443
00:35:27,405 --> 00:35:29,498  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I've never been
so scared.

444
00:35:29,574 --> 00:35:33,066  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I ran, and I hid
in the woods all day.

445
00:35:33,144 --> 00:35:35,078  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wanted to get out...

446
00:35:35,146 --> 00:35:36,943  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wanted to get out ofhere.

447
00:35:37,015 --> 00:35:39,711  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I wanted
to get out ofhere.

448
00:35:39,784 --> 00:35:41,479  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Bring her inside.

449
00:35:41,553 --> 00:35:44,044  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(crying)

450
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:57,367  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Thankyou.

451
00:35:57,435 --> 00:35:58,834  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Hello. This is DoctorJoseph.

452
00:35:58,903 --> 00:36:01,371  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
This is Agent Mulder
from the F.B.I.

453
00:36:01,439 --> 00:36:03,669  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I was told I could reach
Agent Scully at this number.

454
00:36:03,741 --> 00:36:06,335  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
We released Lyle Parker
from the hospital.

455
00:36:06,411 --> 00:36:08,140  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She's taking him back
to the ranch.

456
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:09,510  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I can reach her there?

457
00:36:09,581 --> 00:36:10,878  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Uh-huh. Theyjust left.

458
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,412  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
There's something
I feel you should know.

459
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:17,978  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I received the blood tests
performed on Lyle Parker

460
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:19,556  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and there's something
rather unsettling.

461
00:36:19,624 --> 00:36:20,852  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
What's that?

462
00:36:20,959 --> 00:36:23,427  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Traces ofhis father's
blood type.

463
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:25,360  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It can only be there
through ingestion.

464
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:11,833  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Power's out.

465
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,844  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Yep. Happens to us
all the time

466
00:37:13,912 --> 00:37:15,174  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
being out here
in the sticks.

467
00:37:15,246 --> 00:37:16,838  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I'll fire up
the generator.

468
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:20,841  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(gasps)

469
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,944  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You okay?

470
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:24,612  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I feel sick.

471
00:37:24,722 --> 00:37:26,747  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Please, help me
into the bathroom.

472
00:37:37,869 --> 00:37:40,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Damn. Keeps disconnecting.

473
00:37:40,271 --> 00:37:42,205  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
The mountains must be
blocking the signal.

474
00:37:42,273 --> 00:37:43,706  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
How much farther?

475
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:45,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
About seven miles.

476
00:37:45,743 --> 00:37:49,509  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(gasping)

477
00:37:49,581 --> 00:37:52,243  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lyle, let me come in.

478
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,784  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lyle, I want to takeyou
back to the hospital. Okay?

479
00:37:57,889 --> 00:38:01,655  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
No! I'll be all right.

480
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:04,661  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(gasping)

481
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:11,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(gasping)

482
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:13,595  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lyle?

483
00:38:13,671 --> 00:38:15,036  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lyle, answer me.

484
00:38:15,106 --> 00:38:16,698  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(gasping)

485
00:38:16,774 --> 00:38:19,072  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Lyle, areyou
all right?

486
00:38:19,143 --> 00:38:21,668  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(grunts)

487
00:38:32,223 --> 00:38:36,057  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(roaring)

488
00:38:43,234 --> 00:38:45,862  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(grunts)

489
00:38:45,937 --> 00:38:49,873  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(growls)

490
00:38:59,784 --> 00:39:01,877  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(yelling)

491
00:39:07,325 --> 00:39:09,589  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(gasps)

492
00:40:13,691 --> 00:40:15,989  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(whispering loudly:)
Scully!

493
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:24,126  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(growls)

494
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,290  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(growling)

495
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:51,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(gunshots)

496
00:40:59,737 --> 00:41:01,671  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(growls)

497
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:20,355  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Aah!

498
00:41:20,424 --> 00:41:22,756  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
It's okay. It's me.

499
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:24,761  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I don't know
what happened.

500
00:41:24,829 --> 00:41:26,763  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Somethingjumped me downstairs.
I lost my gun.

501
00:41:26,831 --> 00:41:29,925  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I heard it come up here.
Come on.

502
00:41:30,001 --> 00:41:31,935  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Okay.

503
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:38,158  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(growling)

504
00:42:38,236 --> 00:42:40,295  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
(gunshot)

505
00:42:44,175 --> 00:42:46,769  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
You all right?

506
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,675  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Oh, my God.

507
00:42:55,253 --> 00:42:57,050  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
He was
in the bathroom sick

508
00:42:57,121 --> 00:43:00,522  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
and then we were attacked
by the mountain lion.

509
00:43:00,591 --> 00:43:02,855  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Mulder:
It wasn't a mountain lion.

510
00:43:02,927 --> 00:43:04,895  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Charley:
It's still in a cage.

511
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:26,884  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Where's Gwen?

512
00:43:26,951 --> 00:43:29,579  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She said she'd come
see us before we left.

513
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:31,246  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
She left last night.

514
00:43:31,322 --> 00:43:34,086  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Gave away all her possessions
to her friends.

515
00:43:34,158 --> 00:43:36,854  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
just pulled up
and left? Why?

516
00:43:36,928 --> 00:43:39,795  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Her brother's gone,
no family.

517
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:41,491  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Trouble with Parker
is all over.

518
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:46,193  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe she saw something that
she wasn't ready to understand.

519
00:43:48,506 --> 00:43:50,201  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Maybe.

520
00:43:54,979 --> 00:43:57,209  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Well, thankyou.

521
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:08,750  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
F.B.I.

522
00:44:10,962 --> 00:44:13,260  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
Seeyou in about...

523
00:44:13,331 --> 00:44:15,026  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
eightyears.

524
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:17,431  X1:000 X2:719 Y1:002 Y2:479
I hope not.
