00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:09,540
Don't turn around
or I'll blow your head off.

498
00:41:12,416 --> 00:41:14,714
Don't think I won't do it,
you son of a bitch.

499
00:41:14,786 --> 00:41:17,448
No, I believe you.
just stay cool. I'm with you.

500
00:41:17,522 --> 00:41:19,547
Take two steps forward.

501
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:32,099
Now move slowly
towards the couch.

502
00:41:45,917 --> 00:41:50,047
Turn around and
sit down on your hands.

503
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:04,198
- Are you going to let me
tell you why I'm here?
- I know why you’re here.

504
00:42:04,268 --> 00:42:06,202
I want to know who sent you--

505
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,704
whose errand boy you are.

506
00:42:08,773 --> 00:42:10,934
No one sent me.

507
00:42:17,014 --> 00:42:19,574
You've got
the rest of your life
to give me answers.

508
00:42:37,835 --> 00:42:40,497
[Grunt]

509
00:42:49,046 --> 00:42:52,209
Oh, no.

510
00:42:52,283 --> 00:42:54,649
[ Sighs ]
Oh, damn it.

511
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:58,086
What's wrong?

512
00:42:58,155 --> 00:43:00,715
Let's--
Let's get out of here.

513
00:43:07,064 --> 00:43:11,398
How high does it go, Skinner?
Who's pulling the strings?

514
00:43:11,469 --> 00:43:14,267
You can kill me, Scully.
But you’ll only be doing
their work for 'em.

515
00:43:14,338 --> 00:43:19,435
Forget about your job and your
family. You'll spend the rest
of your life behind bars.

516
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:21,602
There isn't a federal judge
that they couldn't persuade.

517
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:23,737
What's the alternative?
Let you kill me now?

518
00:43:23,848 --> 00:43:27,181
I didn't come here to kill you.
I came here to give you something.

519
00:43:31,389 --> 00:43:33,323
I've got the digital tape.

520
00:43:35,459 --> 00:43:37,689
- You're lying.
- I've got it in my pocket.

521
00:43:37,762 --> 00:43:39,787
I took it out of Mulder's desk.

522
00:43:39,864 --> 00:43:43,163
[Footsteps]

523
00:43:56,781 --> 00:44:01,819
