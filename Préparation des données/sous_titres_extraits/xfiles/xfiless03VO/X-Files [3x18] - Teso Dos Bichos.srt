I think Craig Horning was killed because
of the project he was working on.

00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,720
Is that the, uh,
"the survey and excavation...

34
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,200
of the highland burial grounds
of the Secona Indians" ?

35
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,800
This is from a letter that
was sent to the state department
on behalf of the Secona,

36
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,280
demanding the return
of a certain artifact.

37
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,440
The Amaru Urn. It was among
the antiquities we rescued last month.

38
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:55,680
- Rescued ?
- When Petro Ecuador announced
plans to build a gas pipeline...

39

Carl Roosevelt and I organized the dig.

40
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:04,600
As I understand it, Roosevelt
disappeared under circumstances
not dissimilar to ones here.

41
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,040
The Ecuadorian government claimed he was
carried off in some wild animal attack.

But that's not what you believe.

- Not after last night.
- Have there ever been
any death threats ?

44
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,640
- No.
- Well, what about the curse ?

45
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,040
Secona believed that great evil
will befall anyone that disturbs
the remains of an Amaru.

46
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,640
A woman shaman. That they would
be devoured by the jaguar spirit.

47
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,160
A myth that gained some currency
among the Secona
when Dr. Roosevelt disappeared.

48
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,680
- I'm sure.
- The unfortunate thing is...

49
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,640
somebody exploiting it
to promote fear.

50
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:40,760
To pressure us into returning the bones.
Which I have no intention of doing.

- Can we see it ?
- Yes, of course. Mona.

52

Personally, if someone digs me
up in a thousand years, I hope
there's a curse on them too.

53
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,800
They should have left it buried.
None of this would have happened.

about the piece being brought here ?

- No, not Craig.
- Are you aware that

was sent to the state department
concerning this urn ?

of protest.

- This one was written
by a man named Alonso Bilac.
- Dr. Bilac.

66

He was the liaison
with the Secona Indians.

67
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,200
- Is he still with the project ?
- No, he either resigned...

68
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:50,480
or was forced out by Dr. Lewton,
depending on who you talk to.

Why is that ?

70
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,920
Dr. Bilac feels the Secona have
the right to determine the fate
of their ancestral remains.

back the Amaru Urn.

- Mona Wustner.

81

But you were Dr. Roosevelt's
liaison in Ecuador.

82
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,600
At what point did you part company
with him on the taking of artifacts ?

00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,640
When I felt like he had gone too far
against the wishes of the Secona.

84
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:07,520
Did you express that to him ?

85
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,960
Yes. He wouldn't listen.

86
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,760
Were you speaking for yourself
or for the Indians ?

87
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,080
I spent the last six months...

88
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,600
living with the Secona,
learning from them.

89
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,640

90
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,760

91
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,280
Well, apparently they've learned
something from you too.

92
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:37,760
Yes, I’ve been teaching them
the joys of American bureaucracy.

93
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:45,240
Dr. Lewton believes that
the protests over the Amaru Urn...

94
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,960
has something to do with
Craig Horning's disappearance.

95
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:53,000

as if you expect to see him alive again.

Craig Horning will continue to happen,

until the bones are returned
to their rightful place.

102

Let me ask you, Dr. Bilac.

103
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,560
How far would you go to defend
the rights of the Seconas ?

104
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,040
Farther than writing a letter
to the state department ?

105
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:33,240
If you think I did this,
then you're a fool.

- I was here.

kill for their cause ?

112
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,920
- You think Bilac's a suspect ?
- No. I think he's the suspect.

113
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,320
- Based on what ?
- Based on the arrogance
of his politics,

114
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,680
on his rift with Dr. Lewton,
on his sympathies towards the Indians...

115
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
and the lack of
any other suspects.

116
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:15,200
- He did look a little squirrelly.
- Maybe because he was up late
murdering Craig Horning.

have a body and not much more

119
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:26,400
- I'm not sure he did anything.
- So you think Bilac's innocent ?

120
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,520
That the victim wasn't murdered
at all, that he was devoured by

at all out here ?

168
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:09,880
If Dr. Lewton was brought through here,
it's going to be hard to determine.

169
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,400
Looks like it rained
pretty hard last night.

170
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,600
Well, they determined
that the hood release had been pulled.

171
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,600
And they found
a small flashlight near the car.

172
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,480
It looks to me like he was checking
the engine when he was attacked.

173
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,400
- Maybe somebody
didn't want that car started.
- I don't think so, Mulder.

174
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:27,840
- Why not ?
- We found evidence of two mutilated
rat bodies in the engine compartment.

175
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:31,280
- Rats ?
- Apparently, the museum's
always had a rat problem.

176
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,320
They must've crawled
into the engine to keep warm.

177
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,800
You know, Mulder, there's hardly a thing
about these deaths that adds up.

178
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,200
What's the estimate
on the time of death ?

179
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,160
Somewhere between 9:30 and midnight
when the guard discovered the blood.

180
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,840
It's about the same time
as Craig Horning.

181
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,360
- What's the connection ?
- I don't know.

182
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,200
- I think Mona Wustner
might know something.
- Why ?

183
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,240
Well, she seemed to get nervous
when I asked her about Bilac.

184
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,880
Maybe she's trying to protect him.

185
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:04,400
I think it's starting
to rain again.

186
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,880
I don't think so, Mulder.

Dr. Lewton is dead.

194
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,360
Did you hear what I said ?

195
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,040
Say something, Lonnie, please.
You're scaring me.

196
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,400
- I told you not to come here !
- Why not ?

you're acting like some stranger.

- Can’t you see what
you're doing to yourself?
- Go.

- Let me help you !
- I said get out !

Well, it's human.
Small intestine.

215
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,200
There's about four feet of jejunum
and another foot of ileum.

216
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,440
- Do we know for sure it's Lewton ?
- Yeah, by what he had for lunch.

217
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,800
Corn Chowder. And it looks
like he'd been snacking on
sunflower seeds all afternoon.

218
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:26,360
- A man of taste.
- What I can't determine is
how the body was eviscerated.

219
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,560
There are no knife marks
on the epithelium.

220
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,960
I imagine that they could have been torn
or pulled from the body cavity.

221
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,480
- "Torn or pulled" ?
- But I can't determine that either...

222
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,720
because there was considerable
postmortem predation.

223
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:41,760
- By what ?
- By the size of the bite marks,
a small animal.

224
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
Most probably a rat.

225
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,440

He frightened me. I--
I thought he was gonna hurt me.

- He's sick. He doesn't
know what he's doing.

- Where is he now ?
- At his house.

I left him there and I came back
to the museum, but...

No. But her car
is parked outside.

- She's not here. Did you find Bilac ?
- No, he's not here either.

Listen to this.

"I've seen the Amaru
coming out of the jungle...

- Is there a date of entry on that ?
- These are all recent.

259
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,880
Read me that part about the jaguar
coming down from the trees again.

260
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
- Why ?
- Maybe that's how
the intestines got up there.

Mulder, I think
Bilac's been tripping.

262
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,600
I found something strange
in a ceremonial bowl.

263
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:48,400
And from his writings, it says
it's a hallucinogen called "yaje--

the vine of the soul. "

265

What the hell's
that supposed to mean ?

266
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:56,280
I think he's been praying to the Amaru
through some kind of a ceremony.

00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:59,920
- What does he want from her ?

00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:56,960
No, I think those rats were killed
trying to escape from something.

334
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,000
- Something that sent them
diving into the toilet ?
- No, the lids were down.

335
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,680
They were trying to get out.
They were coming from
within the sewer lines.

336
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,240
- Trying to get away from something.
- Have you been drinking yaje ?

337
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,120
Go with it, Scully.

338
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,720
Agent Scully? Bilac's gone.

339
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,760
What ? How's that possible ?

340
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,640
I don't know. I went to check
on him and he just wasn't there.

341
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,920
- Did you step away from
this door at any time ?
- No.

342
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,320
- And no one entered this room ?
- Absolutely not.

343
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,600
- What about a rat ?
- Sir ?

344
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,880
- Did you ever see
any rats in this room ?
- All the time. Why ?

345
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,000
- How do you think they get in here ?
- Through the old heating system.

346
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,000
There are vents
all over the place.

347
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:46,720
[Scully]
Are there any other doors
or windows in this room ?

348
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:49,800
- [Officer] I checked.
There's only one way out.
- You didn't hear anything ?

349
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,800
Nothing.

350
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,120
I want you to search the entire building
beginning with every room on this floor.

351
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:59,000
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, Scully, take a look at this.

352
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,640
- Where does that lead to ?
- The old steam tunnel.

353
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:10,680
- How do you get down there ?
- They're pretty much sealed up.
Haven't been used for 50 years.

354
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,160
Do you think Bilac
crawled down there ?

355
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,920
Unless he was dragged.

356
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,480
The system looks like it branches off
into three directions.

357
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,880
There must be miles
of tunneling down there.

358
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:47,080
- [Mulder]
And only one way in.
- And one way out.

359
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:50,120
Ladies first ?

360
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,440
Which way ?

361
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,800
To the left, it looks like.

362
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,840
- [Banging]
- [ Gasps ]

363
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,560
Follow that rat.

364
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,840
We should be directly
under the museum here.

365
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,640
Scully ?

366
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,880
- Scully !
- What is it ?

367
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,840
[Scully]
Oh, my God.

368
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,600
It's Dr. Lewton.

369
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Looks like his eyes were eaten
right out of his sockets.

370
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,640
We still don't know by what.

371
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,880
- What is it ?
- I think it's a cat.

372
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,160
Do you think that cat
killed these people ?

373
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,920
No, these cats.

374
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,480
- Which way is out ?
- [Cat Screeching]

375
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,960
Come on, Scully !

376
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,160
[ Cats Screeching ]

377
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,640
No, Mulder. This way.

378
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,200
There's a room here
with a vent.

379
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,280
There.

380
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,280
[ Screeches ]

381
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,000
[ Gasps ]

382
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,680
- It's Bilac.
- [Banging]

383
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,040
Can you jump in there ?

384
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,080
- Yeah.
- Come on.

385
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,040

[Siren Wailing]

388
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,640
He's been down there too long.
It's all right. Come on up.

389
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,320
Okay, I will call
you back later.

390
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,680
Well, the search team's
on their way back up.

391
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,360
They've recovered all the bodies,
including Mona's and Bilac's.

392
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,360
What about the cats ?

393
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:11,400
No. Animal control is still looking.
So far they haven't found
any sign of them.

394
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,600
Well, we both saw them down there,
Scully. We know they're down there.

395
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,240
No one's denying that. It’s just that
there are miles of tunnels down there...

396
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:21,160
and they're saying it's gonna take weeks
to search them all.

397
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,960
- Well, by then it won't even matter.
- What are you talking about ?

398
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,800
I just got off the phone with the
Assistant Secretary of State’s office.

399
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,440
- They've called in
the Ecuadorian Ambassador.
- What for?

400
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,560
Five people had to die,
but they're finally taking it seriously.

401
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,840
- The curse ?
- No.

402
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
Bilac's letter of protest.

403
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,280
The state department has asked
that the museum remain closed
until they can act officially on it.

404
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,640
Are they going
to send back the bones ?

405
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,120
The urn will be back in Ecuador
by the end of the week.

406
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,320
[Mulder Narrating]
The Suffolk County Coroner ruled
the death sat the museum...

407
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,920
were the result
of animal attacks.

408
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:02,920
What motivated these attacks
and why no more have occurred
since has not been explained.

409
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:11,720
To the museum, the Amaru Urn was
an artifact from a dying culture.

410
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,960
Its curse merely
a primitive superstition.

411
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,320
Dr. Bilac learned there is
a world beyond our own,

412
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,440
unseen but powerful,

413
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,200
and as real at the urn itself.

414
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:29,600
The icons from that world represent
forces that cannot be tamed...

415
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,000
or collected in a museum.

416
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,240
The true curse that struck the museum
was the failure to understand...

417
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,560
that there are powers
that should not be disturbed--
