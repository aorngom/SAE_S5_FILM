1
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:17,230
Self isn't something you find.

2
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:20,930
It's something you create.

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,930
The more action you take, the more progress you make.

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:29,330
Self isn't something you find.

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,700
It's something you create.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,000
The more action you take, 

7
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,100
The more progress you make.

8
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:43,600
Self isn't something you find.

9
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,360
It's something you create.

10
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,860
The more action you take, the more progress you make.

11
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,660
Self isn't something you find.

12
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,400
It's something you create.

13
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:03,630
Okay, the lady in red... guess.

14
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:06,130
She's, um...

15
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,700
Allergic to perfume.

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,200
It's... It's a good guess. She just sneezed.

17
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,930
She's having an affair. Next?

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,230
Hold on. Having an affair?

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,730
You made that up.

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,930
Not at all. If you look closely, she has a very peculiar...

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,630
My attitude towards life

22
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,060
determines life's attitude towards me.

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,830
You got a job to do, you do it right.

24
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,230
Stop.

25
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:35,730
Put your hands in the air now.

26
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,500
Oh. Make a federal case out of it, why don't you?

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,260
- Drop it. Drop the blanket.  - Your hands, sir. Both hands.

28
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,960
That's gratitude for you.

29
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:46,730
Hey! Put your hands above your head!

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,630
I bring you a gift, and this is how I'm treated?

31
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,130
What gift?

32
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,660
I dragged, uh, three blocks.

33
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,960
Jane...

34
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,360
Pupils are dilated.

35
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:01,360
Are you on drugs, mister, uh...

36
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:04,600
Resnick. Carl Resnick. I don't do drugs.

37
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,700
- Crack is whack.  - Steady pulse. Steady as a rock

38
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,200
- for someone that dragged a body three blocks.  - Hey.

39
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,700
Let me handle this, Jane. I'll do it.

40
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,730
So this is a gift, huh? Is that why you brought her here to us?

41
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,800
Her? Them.

42
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,500
There's more than one?

43
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,560
It's a whole bagful, fella. What do you need, glasses?

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,660
A bagful of what?

45
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:28,730
Potatoes.

46
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,330
Potatoes.

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,830
I'm supposed to deliver them to the police.

48
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:36,000
- You are the police, right?  - Near enough. He's a perfect subject.

49
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:39,160
- Subject?  - For implanting a suggestion. He's hypnotized.

50
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,400
- He's lying.  - Is he?

51
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,900
Oh, given that the girl he dragged in here dead

52
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,900
is not actually a bag of spuds like he says, then yeah.

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,160
Well, it's not lying if he believes it.

54
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:08,900
Okay.

55
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,500
Thank you.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,530
So, Carl, 

57
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,060
Why would you bring a bag of potatoes to the police?

58
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,030
Uh, I... I don't... I... I can't...

59
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,830
Potatoes to cops?

60
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,930
Potatoes. Not doughnuts, but potatoes.

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,030
Did someone tell you to do it?

62
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,960
- Yes! Yes.  - Who?

63
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,660
Uh...

64
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:35,330
I can't remember.

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,660
Try.

66
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,360
I'm trying.

67
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:40,930
What if I told you it wasn't potatoes?

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,300
That in fact, it was a dead girl you were dragging around?

69
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,700
You have a twisted sense of humor.

70
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,730
Here's proof, Carl. What do you see there?

71
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,930
Potatoes.

72
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,730
- He is crazy.  - Nope. Just hypnotized.

73
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,060
Oh, come on.

74
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:05,330
Hypnosis is just a way to connect to the imagination

75
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,330
rather than the conscious mind.

76
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,800
The mind will accept whatever the imagination creates, 

77
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:11,260
however bizarre.

78
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,460
Hypnotism is what you use against my explicit orders

79
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,560
to get witnesses to tell the truth.

80
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,560
It's a little different than convincing somebody

81
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,630
that a dead girl is a sack of vegetables.

82
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,160
Different in scale.

83
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,160
Well, he doesn't look like he's in a trance or anything.

84
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:27,160
Neither did Minelli when I hypnotized him to stop smoking.

85
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:30,500
The subject acts normally except inside the suggestion.

86
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,100
Carl's suggestion is

87
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,100
to have this very powerful hallucination

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,100
and to forget who did this.

89
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,900
Whoever hypnotized him, I gotta say... good.

90
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,930
Good enough to hypnotize Carl into killing a girl?

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,630
Well, that depends on whether deep down, 

92
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,360
Carl really wanted to kill a girl.

93
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,100
But he's hypnotized.

94
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:52,100
Uh, no suggestion in the world can make you do something

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,130
against your moral character, against your true will.

96
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,800
A hypnotized saint is still a saint.

97
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,660
Not that he's a saint.

98
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,430
Uh, so if Carl's a killer, he can be hypnotized to kill.

99
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:07,800
- Otherwise...  - Otherwise the hypnotist killed the girl and framed Carl for it.

100
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,860
Rigsby.

101
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:17,860
So is Carl a killer? What did we find out about him?

102
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:20,930
- He sells cars, boats, stuff like that.  - And you know this how?

103
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Well, he's very well-mannered, 

104
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,930
a little over-groomed, 

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,760
too badly dressed to be gay, 

106
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,500
so salesman.

107
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,500
He works a dealership over on Fulton.

108
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,400
- Oh. Does he have a record?  - Not even a parking ticket.

109
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:36,030
He's a good boy, obeys authority...

110
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,560
a perfect subject for a trance.

111
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,800
He's all soft and squishy and malleable.

112
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,900
Well, can you fix him with a trance or whatever?

113
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,730
Make him remember what happened?

114
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,460
Well, I could try, but without knowing the trigger, 

115
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:51,160
it'll be like you and I playing Marco Polo in the Atlantic.

116
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:53,400
It'll take forever, and you get all pruny.

117
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,830
Easier just to find the hypnotist and ask him.

118
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:58,200
Got an I.D. on the victim.

119
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,160
Her fingerprints were on file with the school board.

120
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:02,430
She's Mary Beth Hendrix, 27.

121
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,400
Her sister's on the way from the airport now.

122
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,260
Yes. Mm, that's Mary Beth.

123
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,560
She, uh...

124
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,100
Someone shot her?

125
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,500
Gunshot wound to the head. I'm sorry.

126
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,300
The coroner says she died instantly.

127
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,160
I can't believe it.

128
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,330
She was fine when I left.

129
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,930
You live together?

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,730
Um, yeah.

131
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,900
Two country girls in the big city.

132
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,900
I didn't want to come here, 

133
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,360
but Mary Beth said she'd take care of me.

134
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,100
Mm. That's funny, huh?

135
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,630
Lindsay?

136
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,260
Your trip to San Francisco?

137
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:58,530
Yeah. Um, just overnight, for work.

138
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,700
I had just landed when you called.

139
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,700
Mary Beth's an elementary school teacher, right?

140
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:07,330
Um, she was, yeah. But last year I got her a job where I work, 

141
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,760
at the model life centre downtown.

142
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:12,860
Mary Beth was the boss' assistant.

143
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,860
And I'm an event planner.

144
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,360
I help the doctor plan N.L.P. seminars around the country.

145
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,100
What's N.L.P.?

146
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,600
Neuro-linguistic programming.

147
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,930
Uh, well, "sneaky ways to influence people"

148
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,930
doesn't sound quite as catchy.

149
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,330
Well, Dr. Daniel changes lives.

150
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,930
Royston Daniel?

151
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,930
Yes. He's the best.

152
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:33,330
Uh-huh.

153
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,200
Who's Royston Daniel?

154
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,060
Dr. Royston Daniel is

155
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,830
one of the country's preeminent hypnotherapists.

156
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,360
Mary Beth is dead?

157
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,030
Oh, my god.

158
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,660
- You knew Mary Beth then?  - Sure.

159
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:55,160
I-I met her at the model life centre.

160
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,230
I'm taking Dr. Daniel's N.L.P. Course, 

161
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,400
to help me be a better salesman.

162
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,400
Did you spend a lot of time with Mary Beth?

163
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,560
At the Monday class...

164
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:08,330
uh, I didn't understand the exercise.

165
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,330
Mary Beth spent her whole lunch explaining it to me.

166
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,830
She's a great teacher.

167
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,600
Patient, you know?

168
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,900
Even with a dope like me.

169
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:20,330
So now do you remember who hypnotized you?

170
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,600
I got nothing. I'm sorry.

171
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:28,000
Mary Beth...

172
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:30,160
What happened to her?

173
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:32,160
We should go take a look at Daniel

174
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,560
- and this model life centre.  - Let's bring Carl.

175
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,660
- What for?  - Uh, it's where the hypnotists are.

176
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:41,900
Oh. Carl is still our prime suspect in this.

177
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,900
We can't use him as bait.

178
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,730
Well, as long as we don't lose him or break him, 

179
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,100
then what's the problem?

180
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:59,260
"get what you want from whoever you want"... scam.

181
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,260
Not to mention bad grammar.

182
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:04,030
Neuro-linguistic programming is not a scam.

183
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,430
It's the science of willpower and persuasion

184
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,300
and communicating more deeply.

185
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,360
- A way to better your life.  - Yeah, scam.

186
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:14,000
A scam that can better your life.

187
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,460
Ooh, deep. You two stay here.

188
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,660
Good afternoon.

189
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,260
My name is Dr. Royston Daniel, 

190
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,260
and I'm gonna teach you

191
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:28,330
the secrets of neuro-linguistic programming.

192
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,430
Many of you may not fully believe in the power of trance, 

193
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,960
but I promise, you will.

194
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:38,300
Excuse me, young man. This is not the moment. I'm s...

195
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,900
Wake.

196
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,030
What's going on?

197
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,660
Dr. Daniel, what happened?

198
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:50,660
Ladies and gentlemen, a round of applause for Mike here

199
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:54,000
for being such a good sport.

200
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,330
You're all here because you want something.

201
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,000
You want power

202
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,960
or you want money, you want love, you want...

203
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,300
I... I want a quick word with you privately.

204
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,760
I'm in the middle of something right now.

205
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,560
Oh, it's very important. It's about your boat.

206
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:23,400
My boat? I don't have a boat.

207
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,860
No, it's on fire.

208
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,560
Rick, get security, would you...

209
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,930
- Look, sir, I don't know what...  - sir?

210
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:32,060
Your assistant Mary Beth has been murdered.

211
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,660
California Bureau of Investigation.

212
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:39,130
We'd like to speak with you.

213
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,700
You're gonna have to... excuse me, folks.

214
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,200
Um, my associate, Mr. Rick Tiegler,

215
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,900
will conduct the seminar from here on in.

216
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,000
I hope to see you again soon.

217
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,630
Okay. Good. Uh...

218
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,630
As dr. Daniel has shown,

219
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,200
trance is incredibly powerful.

220
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,730
We're gonna teach you

221
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,900
how to unleash that power for yourselves.

222
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,400
Let's start by relaxing

223
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,600
with a few simple breathing exercises.

224
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,600
Then we're gonna show you how to supercharge your life.

225
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,700
How does that sound? How does that sound?

226
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,630
Hi, Dr. Daniel.

227
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,030
Carl, is this the man who hypnotized you?

228
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:37,130
- Let's have a look at those eyes.  - Hey.

229
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,560
Jane. Do you know this man?

230
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:43,060
Well, his face is familiar. Is he one of my students?

231
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:44,760
Mm...

232
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:46,560
No.

233
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:49,260
Rigsby, speak to Dr. Daniel. Take Jane with you.

234
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:52,030
Carl and I are gonna go back to the seminar.

235
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,430
That way, I know he won't get lost or broken.

236
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,600
- Can we use your office?  - Yes, this way.

237
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:03,300
I'll catch up.

238
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,500
This is terrible.

239
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,260
Poor girl.

240
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,900
I had a bad feeling when she didn't come in this morning.

241
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,900
It's not like her to disappear.

242
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,860
Did she have any, uh, pr...

243
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:31,200
problems lately?

244
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,600
Bad breakup? Anybody who might wanna hurt her?

245
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,030
Um, I... I wouldn't know.

246
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,030
Mary Beth's personal life was her own.

247
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,030
She was brought in to us by Carl Resnick out there.

248
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,430
- He was hypnotized to think she was a big bag of potatoes.  - Hmm. Strong stuff.

249
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:47,000
That's an old shot. 

250
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,430
Who could have done that?

251
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,430
Oh, very few people have the talent

252
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,000
- to create a trance that powerful. Very few.  - Other than you, of course.

253
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:57,360
Hmm.

254
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:00,630
Where were you last night between midnight and 6:00?

255
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,930
Oh. Wait now. You think I killed Mary Beth?

256
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,700
- Did you?  - Well, maybe I need a lawyer here.

257
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,700
Maybe. I wouldn't have a clue.

258
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,400
- Rigsby, is he gonna need a lawyer?  - Uh, Dr. Daniel, tell us about your students.

259
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,500
Uh, what kind of people want to get whatever they want

260
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,900
- from whoever they want?  - Who... who wouldn't want to make their life better?

261
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,400
Using trance as a tool,

262
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:26,860
N.L.P. can help everyone from insomniacs, soccer moms,

263
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,360
to high-powered executives, smokers, the weight-challenged.

264
00:13:30,430 --> 00:13:32,730
Anyone who wants to improve his life.

265
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,730
And control the lives of others?

266
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,360
Some of my students want to sell to their customers better

267
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,200
or make people like and respect them.

268
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,530
There's nothing wrong with that. Right?

269
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,430
Oh. Excuse me.

270
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,730
Uh, Royston, I just have the files

271
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,830
for the, uh, advance work

272
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,760
- for the seminar in San Francisco.  - Lindsay, you came in.

273
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,760
Yeah. I just had to keep busy, you know?

274
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,660
Well, thanks. But you don't belong here. Not today.

275
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,060
Whatever this is can wait. It's not important.

276
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:07,660
What?

277
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:11,100
I'm, uh, otherwise occupied, as you can see.

278
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,130
Go home. Grieve.

279
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,130
Don't worry about us. We'll survive.

280
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,900
Take care of you.

281
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,800
Right.

282
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,700
Sorry. This was, uh...

283
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,560
It was a bad idea.

284
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:23,930
Sorry.

285
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,460
I'm sorry.

286
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,960
"take care of you" ...

287
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,560
That's the smoothest blowoff I've heard all day.

288
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,600
I have a question for you guys... are you feeling it?

289
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,200
Yes!

290
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,130
- Are you feeling it?  - Yeah!

291
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,760
Are you guys feeling it?

292
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,600
Yeah!

293
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,500
All right. Now I¡¯m gonna talk to you guys individually, okay?

294
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,330
And I may ask one or two of you to come up on stage and help me.

295
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,200
- Would you do that? Would you come on stage and help me?  - Yeah!

296
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,230
- What are you doing here?  - What do you want me to do here?

297
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,860
Uh, I¡¯m sorry. I actually thought you were someone else. 

298
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:03,500
Sir? 

299
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,960
I'll be right back.

300
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,230
Mr. Tiegler!

301
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,330
Stop!

302
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,560
Mr. Tiegler!

303
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:28,030
- Didn't like the class?  - Cuffs.

304
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:31,500
Looks like I caught the mystery hypnotist.

305
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,330
Got what you want from who you want.

306
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,160
N.L.P. stuff seems to work.

307
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,700
Come on. Buddy, come on.

308
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,400
Come on, man. Let's go.

309
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,500
I'm not talking about Carl. I don't know anything about him.

310
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,100
Okay. Let's talk about your job.

311
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,900
Agent Rigsby asked around at the center.

312
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,800
Everyone says you're Dr. Daniel's number one guy.

313
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,800
I'm proud to assist Dr. Daniel.

314
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,060
I'm good at what I do.

315
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,060
That's what the model life is all about.

316
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:04,560
If anyone could put the hex on Carl Resnick, it's you.

317
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:06,700
I wouldn't say that. No.

318
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,960
Did you ever try your stuff on Mary Beth Hendrix?

319
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,160
I'm not talking about her either.

320
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:15,800
Are you a drinker, Rick? Would you like one now?

321
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,400
Are you offering?

322
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:19,400
No.

323
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:22,400
I'm not a drunk. I'm just under a lot of stress.

324
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:25,300
I understand. Were you drunk when you killed Mary Beth?

325
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,500
- I didn't.  - That's right. You didn't.

326
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,030
But if something happened when you were drunk,

327
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,830
that means you had diminished capacity.

328
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,830
It means you're not responsible like you normally would be. 

329
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,530
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

330
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,600
Yeah, I know that.

331
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,700
Well, is that how it was?

332
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,000
Maybe, uh, I don't really know.

333
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:45,900
Tell me what happened.

334
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:50,260
Yesterday I kind of asked Mary Beth out.

335
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,500
She said no.

336
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:55,960
Actually, she said no way...

337
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,330
In hell.

338
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,360
So last night you were mad, maybe went to a bar to forget.

339
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,430
Yeah, I kind of hoisted a few. Dozen.

340
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,430
But I mean, come on.

341
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,530
Every... everybody needs to let off a little steam, right? 

342
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,830
I lasted till about 1:00,

343
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,000
And then I...

344
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,260
I kind of blacked out.

345
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,660
And then when I woke up,

346
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,560
It was 5:00 a.m. And I was in Mary Beth¡¯s living room.

347
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,430
I was standing over her body...

348
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,400
And I was holding a gun.

349
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:34,000
I could smell the powder, but...

350
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,360
I was just standing there,

351
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:39,530
as calm as could be.

352
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,300
So you killed her?

353
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,630
Yeah, I guess I did.

354
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,960
But like you said, I'm... I'm not responsible.

355
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:51,460
And after you killed her, that's when you decided

356
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,930
to use your skills to frame Carl Resnick?

357
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,760
We'd been partners in a trance exercise,

358
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,700
and I'd put him under a couple of times.

359
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,860
After that, it just gets easier,

360
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,860
especially with someone like Carl.

361
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,430
He's such a cream puff.

362
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,430
What did you think would happen

363
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,460
when Carl dragged a murdered girl's body to the cops?

364
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:14,300
Did you think Carl was getting out of there alive?

365
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,900
Well...

366
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,860
Rick, we're charging you with the murder of Mary Beth Hendrix.

367
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,800
Stay put.

368
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,200
- Really?  - Really.

369
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,160
Be with you in just a sec.

370
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,900
Oh, hey, boss.

371
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,930
Has Cho searched Tiegler's place yet?

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,430
He's getting a warrant now.

373
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,060
I just finished up with the student interviews.

374
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,330
- How's it going here?  - Yeah, a couple more teachers to go, but, uh,

375
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,600
so far nobody knows anything about Mary Beth or Tiegler.

376
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,600
I can't believe Rick killed Mary Beth.

377
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,000
Do you think Dr. Daniel

378
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,660
will set up a place to make donations in her name?

379
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:54,530
- A charity for a school would be good.  - He's still here?

380
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,830
Yeah. I've been helping Agent Rigsby parse the sub modalities

381
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,600
- of the teachers' language patterns.  - Translating their double-talk...

382
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,830
"reframing," "pacing,"

383
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,000
uh, "representational systems."

384
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,630
I don't get half of what these guys say.

385
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,530
What are you doing?

386
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,460
What? Uh, nothing.

387
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,700
Are you mimicking me?

388
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,730
It's called modeling. You, uh, model yourself on your subject.

389
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,160
Subject? You're not trying this NLP crap on me.

390
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,100
No. Sort of.

391
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,260
- You said this would establish a rapport.  - Well, it needs work.

392
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,200
I'm going back to the office.

393
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,160
Come and see me when you're done. 

394
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:34,860
I don't believe this NLP stuff works at all.

395
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,500
You will.

396
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,860
No pineapple on this one.

397
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,460
Mmm.

398
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,560
- Oh, no, thanks.  - You have to.

399
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:53,560
- It's tradition. The case is closed.  - Mm.

400
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,430
Mm? There's no mm on this one.

401
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,060
An hour ago, we found the gun that killed Mary Beth

402
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:01,560
In Tiegler's apartment with Tiegler's prints on it.

403
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,930
Plus, you know, the confession.

404
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,030
Didn't Rick Tiegler's blackout strike you as weird?

405
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,330
Well, he got drunk. He blacked out. He killed someone.

406
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,700
Who hasn't been there?  I'm kidding.

407
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,900
Tiegler came out of a drunken stupor

408
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,200
Standing upright over a body

409
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,860
Instead of facedown in a pool of vomit.

410
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:21,430
It sounds more like a trance than a blackout.

411
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,800
Somebody hypnotized Tiegler into killing Mary Beth

412
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,600
And hypnotizing Carl?

413
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,800
It's possible.

414
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,430
I didn't eat all this cheese and grease for nothing.

415
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:32,030
This cased is closed.

416
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,430
You're just seeing suggestion everywhere, Jane.

417
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:37,300
- You're too suggestible.  - Mm.

418
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:42,860
- Oh, right, too much of a control freak for that?  - Hmm. Pot meet kettle. Kettle, pot.

419
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:47,560
Hi. Agent Lisbon,

420
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,130
I'm, uh, here for my sister's effects from our apartment.

421
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,330
- Agent Rigsby'll help you.  - Thank you.

422
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,900
Miss Hendrix, quick question.

423
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,900
- Do you believe Rick Tiegler killed your sister?  - Jane.

424
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:03,130
Actually, uh, I kinda don't.

425
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,660
How did you know?

426
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,230
Why don't you come to my office?

427
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,830
- I... I'm so sorry.  - It's okay. It's fine.

428
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,930
Control freak.

429
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,660
I'm so sorry to be bothering you guys.

430
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,000
I...

431
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,300
What exactly is your concern, Lindsay?

432
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,630
Yeah, it's just... it's been nagging at me,

433
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:26,230
But, um, did, um, did Rick say how he got into our apartment?

434
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,630
No.

435
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,660
He said he was blacked out. Why?

436
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,860
Mary Beth... she really disliked him.

437
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:35,500
I mean, really, really disliked him. I can't imagine

438
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,900
- She would just open the door and let him into our place.  - Well, he couldn't have broken in.

439
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,330
The BFS report says the front door was undamaged.

440
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,500
I don't get it. I mean, we had a dead bolt and a peephole.

441
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:48,130
Mary Beth was all security-conscious

442
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,760
- Ever since she and Royston got mugged.  - She and Dr. Daniel?

443
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,160
Yeah, when he took her to Maui for the weekend.

444
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:57,130
- Some kids... they mugged them. It was awful.  - She and Dr. Daniel were dating?

445
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:00,560
For six months now. I thought he told you.

446
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:03,430
And voila?

447
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,700
- Would you excuse us for a minute?  - Yeah.

448
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,660
Daniel told us Mary Beth was just his assistant.

449
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:19,200
- He didn't know anything about her private life.  - So Daniel lied to us. Why?

450
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,900
- Well, embarrassment, fear, privacy...  - Guilt maybe.

451
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,230
It's probably nothing, but it is a loose end.

452
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,230
That Tiegler's defense attorney could hang us with.

453
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,230
We better go pick up Daniel.

454
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,260
If we walk, you could burn some case-closed pizza calories.

455
00:22:31,330 --> 00:22:32,860
Cute.

456
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,860
Go inside and find out everything

457
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:38,160
- About her sister's relationship with Daniel.  - Okay.

458
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:40,160
Hey, Lindsay. I want you to tell me

459
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:43,100
exactly when Mary Beth started dating Dr. Daniel.

460
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,760
No, um, Royston would never hurt Mary Beth,

461
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:48,760
Not in a million years, if that's what you're thinking.

462
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:51,130
I really am quite busy, you know.

463
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
We'll have you back here very soon, doctor.

464
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:56,030
- If you could just tell me what this about...  - Just a few questions. That's all.

465
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,260
Yes, a few questions about what?

466
00:22:58,330 --> 00:23:01,060
I'm not sure, sir. I won't be the one asking.

467
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,830
Oh, come on, agent. Just a hint.

468
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,360
You know, you're far too pretty to be so solemn.

469
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:13,030
Ah, the curse of the pretty girl.

470
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,030
You've been told you're gorgeous since you were 12 years old,

471
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,860
And now you can't bear to hear what most women long for.

472
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,800
I have a job to do. That's all.

473
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:23,260
Are you really that tough? I didn't think so.

474
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,260
You don't know anything about me.

475
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,630
- No?  - No.

476
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,960
You're ambitious,

477
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,960
More than you'll let anyone see.

478
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,460
A girl from nowhere will desperate to make it big,

479
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:37,630
But you worry that you'll always be small town, small-time,

480
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,200
You haven't got what it takes,

481
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,730
And that's why you're so shut down to everything but this job.

482
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,060
Dr. Daniel?

483
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:48,660
No offense, but I've been working with Patrick Jane

484
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,660
For nine months now.

485
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:52,600
You want to get under my skin?

486
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:56,530
You're gonna have to up you're game. Shall we?

487
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,060
I'll tell you again, Agent Cho.

488
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:06,560
I wasn't sleeping with my assistant.

489
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,760
The assistant's sister says different, doctor.

490
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:11,300
Then she's lying or misled somehow.

491
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,300
In November, the two of you didn't go to Paris for a week?

492
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,000
On business, yes. I travel extensively, teaching.

493
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,760
The same story for 23 minutes now.

494
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,330
Maybe he's telling the truth.

495
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,230
Maybe it's Lindsay Hendrix who's lying.

496
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,460
No, this one's lying. Notice how he can't break eye contact?

497
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:33,160
I'll get the truth out of him. Look, agent Cho, I came here out of courtesy.

498
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:35,560
Now if there's nothing new, I'd like to go.

499
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,830
- Hey, Cho. May I?  - Sure.

500
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,830
Dr. Daniel, tell the truth.

501
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,730
You'll feel better. Trust me.

502
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,900
I'd like to go now.

503
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,600
Rigsby, hey!

504
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,860
Whoa!

505
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,000
All right, all right, we were together.

506
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,930
- We'd been dating since September, okay?  - It feels better, doesn't it?

507
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,460
- Agent Rigsby, outside. Come on.  - You broke my nose, you crazy bastard.

508
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,960
- Dude, I'm fine. This is ridiculous.  - Gun and badge.

509
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,960
- Boss, come on. I...  - now!

510
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:09,530
Damn it, Wayne. Do you understand what you just did?

511
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,030
Oh, dear.

512
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,530
I know.

513
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,230
No. No, this.

514
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,900
No. No way.

515
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,030
Yeah, afraid so. He's been hypnotized.

516
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,130
Oh, dear.

517
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,560
- Oh, I've been hypnotized, have I?  - Mm-hmm.

518
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,600
You're gonna make me do embarrassing things,

519
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,600
- Pretend like I'm Tina Turner or something?  - You wanna be like Tina Turner?

520
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:39,530
Jane, trust me. I'm not hypnotized.

521
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,530
I feel fine, totally normal.

522
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,630
- Normally you don't break the noses of suspects.  - What... what are you talking about?

523
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,760
I just questioned the guy.

524
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:50,130
Do you think this could be psychological?

525
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:53,560
- Some sort of psychotic break?  - No, hypnosis. That's all.

526
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,860
I thought you couldn't hypnotize somebody

527
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,200
- Against this moral character.  - Rigsby has a brutal streak.

528
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,530
If you didn't know, now you know.

529
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,260
It's not an uncommon trait

530
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,830
- in those that choose to go into police work.  - I'm calling a shrink anyway.

531
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,800
No, wait. Deeply hypnotized subjects

532
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,130
Are very suggestible and have very little inhibition.

533
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,030
Rigsby, do me a favor. Close your eyes.

534
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,830
Please.

535
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,700
Now relax. Don't tell me, but think about it...

536
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:24,160
Think about what you most want to be doing right now.

537
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,560
You can do anything you like in the whole world.

538
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,400
What are you gonna do?

539
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:38,200
I want you to open your eyes and do it.

540
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:40,960
Do whatever you like.

541
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,230
Oh, yeah. That's what I'm talking about.

542
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,530
Huh. Okay, he's hypnotized.

543
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,760
Well, unhypnotize him.

544
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:07,200
- You sure?  - Do it.

545
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,360
I can't.

546
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:12,500
The hypnotist uses a specific trigger

547
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,460
To induce a trance.

548
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:17,130
Unless I know that trigger, I can't get him out.

549
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,430
- I have to go.  - Where do you have to go to?

550
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,200
- I can't tell you. I'll see you later.  - Rigsby, no.

551
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,900
- No, no. This is good. This is very good.  - He's not a guinea pig.

552
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,960
- Rigsby, stay here. That's an order.  - I'm sorry, boss. I have to go.

553
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,960
Hey, Rigsby, you can't leave. You can't. You're not well.

554
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:34,200
Cho, stop messing around. I'm fine. Hey!

555
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,430
Talk to him, Grace. He'll listen to you.

556
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,900
Rigsby.

557
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,000
Please stay.

558
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,130
Please?

559
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,160
Okay.

560
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:48,500
But not for long.

561
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,500
Come on. Come sit with me.

562
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,260
Okay.

563
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,260
Rigsby didn't talk to Tiegler, did he?

564
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:00,860
- Nope.  - So Tiegler didn't do this. Maybe he didn't kill Mary Beth either.

565
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,730
It looks like you're right.

566
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:05,130
Rick Tiegler was put in a trance by the real killer

567
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:07,700
- And thought he just blacked out.  - And the same person put Rigsby under.

568
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,430
We need to question everybody Rigsby interviewed

569
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,060
- At the NLP Center and anyone else he talked to.  - It has to be Dr. Daniel, right?

570
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,930
- He's the only one with the chops to do this.  - And plus he lied about sleeping with the victim.

571
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:19,600
No, no, no. Whoa, whoa. Why would he want Rigsby

572
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:22,300
- To smack his own face into a table?  - Although why would anyone else want Rigsby

573
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,130
- To smack Daniel¡¯s face into the table?  - My guess? The smacking of the face into the table...

574
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:28,930
Unintended side effect of a deeper hypnotic command.

575
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:31,130
- Command to do what?  - There's the rub.

576
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,060
Let's find out.

577
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:41,230
I do not need this right now.

578
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,230
Jane's off doing his thing?

579
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,730
Yes, and I should be with him. What the hell happened?

580
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,730
Tiegler got off on bail just like that?

581
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,500
No record and he's not a flight risk.

582
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,930
Plus, it's Judge Milton. He set the bail at $50,000.

583
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,300
- $50,000 for an accessory to murder charge?  - Well, that's the thing.

584
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,300
- A.D.A. dropped it to obstruction.  - A deal?

585
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,930
I was not consulted.

586
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,930
Me neither. Tiegler found some juice somewhere.

587
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,930
Got a defense attorney from Horton & Fleer, whole nine.

588
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,330
- Find out about Tiegler's bail.  - All right.

589
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,900
Hello, agents.

590
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,300
Nice day, huh, to be walking free in the world?

591
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,730
You need supervision.

592
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:19,330
We think you might have been hypnotized

593
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,160
- by Mary Beth's killer.  - Really? That's your play?

594
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:24,630
- You could be in danger, sir.  - You're the danger, lady.

595
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,660
You threw me down a marble staircase.

596
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,330
- Look at this bruise.  - No, thanks.

597
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,500
Mr. Tiegler, what if I'm right? What if you were hypnotized to

598
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:35,230
take the blame for Mary Beth's murder, and the killer

599
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,700
- is still out there? That would make you a loose end, right?  - You cops will try anything, won't you,

600
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,700
to make me doubt myself? You and my mother.

601
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:44,160
Well, it's not gonna work. I'm living the model life.

602
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:46,360
You have a very good day, Agent Lisbon,

603
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:49,260
And try not to bruise anyone.

604
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,900
Tiegler's bond? Tiegler didn't post it.

605
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,560
- Who did?  - The Model Life Centre, incorporated.

606
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:55,730
- Really?  - Yep.

607
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,400
- Look into it.  - Okay.

608
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,530
I gotta get back.

609
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:03,760
Why are we here?

610
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:06,900
I wanted to bring him somewhere where he felt safe, relaxed,

611
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,830
something that brought him back to his childhood,

612
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,830
before he started getting hurt.

613
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,830
- Hurt by who?  - Yeah, hurt by who?

614
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:16,600
Well, whoever. Uh, none of my business.

615
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,600
Here we are.

616
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,330
Please, have a seat.

617
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,800
- Nobody hurt me, okay?  - Jane, don't upset him.

618
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,800
I know what I'm doing.

619
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,430
Are you still on this hypnosis kick?

620
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,700
- I'm telling you, you're wrong.  - Rigsby, I'm gonna have to ask you to trust me, okay?

621
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,600
Try and trust me. I'm gonna help you break this trance.

622
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:42,330
No one's gonna hurt you, okay?

623
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,360
Bring you back to your normal self.

624
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,130
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

625
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,600
- You've got it wrong.  - Maybe so.

626
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:54,130
I mean, everybody makes mistakes, don't they?

627
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,830
That's life, huh?

628
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,160
Ups and downs.

629
00:30:58,230 --> 00:31:00,300
Look at those swings... 

630
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,230
Up... and down.

631
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:06,760
Up... and down.

632
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,960
That's life.

633
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:12,330
Relax into it.

634
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:15,100
Nothing to worry about.

635
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,360
Up... and down.

636
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:23,260
Up... and down.

637
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,330
Up... 

638
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,660
And down.

639
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,930
How are you feeling? Good?

640
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,930
Tingling in your hands?

641
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,030
Buzzing?

642
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,200
- Tingling, I guess, a little.  - That's good.

643
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,230
Now you're watching those swings.

644
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,360
Up... and down.

645
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:47,500
Up... and down.

646
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,330
Let yourself drift away.

647
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:54,830
Feel the tension release... 

648
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,060
Watching the swings.

649
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,560
You're doing it all on your own.

650
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:02,830
That's very good.

651
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:05,960
All on your own.

652
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,960
Now I have to find the hypnotic trigger.

653
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:13,660
It could be visual, auditory or physical.

654
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,160
Watching the swings.

655
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,260
- Dude, don't feel me up, man.  - Deep breathing.

656
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:37,700
Breathe in. Feel the breath.

657
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,530
Feel the breath out.

658
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,900
In... 

659
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,930
And out.

660
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,930
That's good.

661
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,700
Jane, stop.

662
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,100
- What?  - Just... 

663
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,600
Just stop. Okay? I got a splitting headache. Just... 

664
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:55,630
You're just breathing, Rigsby. Just breathing.

665
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,260
No one is hurting you.

666
00:32:57,330 --> 00:33:00,030
No, you are. You're hurting me. Stop it!

667
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,600
- Stop doing your stuff on me!  - Your reaction is part of the suggestion.

668
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:04,100
It's a built-in defense mechanism

669
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,930
- to stop me trying to help you.  - Rigsby, let Jane help you.

670
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,760
Stop. I... I've gotta get to... 

671
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,900
- I... I've gotta go! I've gotta get out of here.  - Wayne! Wayne, stop!

672
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,400
He's in too deep.

673
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,030
If you try to stop him, he'll probably hurt you.

674
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,300
Hello, Dr. Daniel.

675
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,300
Agent Rigsby? Thank god you're here.

676
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,630
Help me.

677
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,060
Shut up, Royston.

678
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:55,060
Wayne, thank you for coming. Thank you for helping me.

679
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,830
Well, I had to come. I know.

680
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:58,760
Hey, Lindsay. I want you to tell me

681
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,800
exactly when Mary Beth started dating Dr. Daniel.

682
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,300
No, uh, uh, Royston would never hurt Mary Beth,

683
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,300
If that's what you're thinking. Not in a million years.

684
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,660
This is just routine. Relax. We'll be done in no time.

685
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:13,760
I will. I'll relax.

686
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,960
I feel very relaxed with you, Wayne.

687
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,700
Very safe.

688
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Very safe and relaxed sitting next to you. 

689
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:28,630
I feel like I could tell you anything... Anything at all.

690
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,600
Let me tell you about Dr. Daniel.

691
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:34,930
I know.

692
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,600
And don't worry.

693
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
Everything's gonna be fine now.

694
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,300
Agent Rigsby.

695
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,930
Agent, I want you to relax and listen very carefully

696
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,060
to the sound of my voice.

697
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,160
You've got to listen to me, for God sake!

698
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:48,330
You've gotta... 

699
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,460
I was so in love with you,

700
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:03,400
you arrogant bastard. 

701
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:05,960
And all you wanted was Mary Beth.

702
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,460
That stupid cow!

703
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,460
And I thought that if I could finally get rid of her,

704
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:13,460
that you would see me and love me for who I am!

705
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:16,260
But you were in San Francisco when Mary Beth was murdered.

706
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:18,200
Yeah, but they have these things called rental cars.

707
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,200
Then I drove up there and I did the deed,

708
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,430
and then I hypnotized that Skeezebag Rick

709
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,430
to take the blame for it.

710
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,560
Got back just in time to catch my flight.

711
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,560
And then when I got off the plane,

712
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,560
I thought that Royston and I would finally be together,

713
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,960
that he would see me for the gifts that I have.

714
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,960
- But he didn't see you.  - No, he didn't.

715
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:37,930
- It's hard when they don't see you.  - What a moron I was.

716
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,360
What a moron.

717
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:43,230
I came to you, and you said to me,

718
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:47,030
"Oh, it's not important. We'll do fine without you.

719
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,060
Go home."

720
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:50,600
Do you remember that?

721
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,100
Look at me!

722
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,900
And I knew in that moment

723
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,260
That you would never love me.

724
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,160
Never.

725
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:05,060
So now you're gonna die. 

726
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:06,930
Rigsby... 

727
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,560
He hurt me.

728
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,300
He hurt me, Rigsby.

729
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,430
You love to protect women, don't you?

730
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,100
I saw how you looked at that red-haired agent.

731
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,760
Grace. Her name's Grace.

732
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:31,630
Wayne, I need your protection right now.

733
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:33,660
I need your help with a special job.

734
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:36,930
- You'll help me, won't you?  - Sure. What do you need me to do?

735
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,030
- I need you to take...  - Hello, Rigsby.

736
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,700
Hey, is that... 

737
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:44,000
Venus or Mercury?

738
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,930
Hansel and Gretel had bread crumbs. I had Rigsby.

739
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,830
I knew he'd lead me to the guilty one,

740
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:51,660
so I put a tracking device in his pocket.

741
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,160
Bingo.

742
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,530
Smart... 

743
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,160
Except for the part where I have the gun.

744
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:04,860
Oh, I have a gun, too. Lisbon?

745
00:37:04,930 --> 00:37:08,130
Drop the weapon!

746
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,300
So predictable.

747
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:11,500
Rick!

748
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,730
You should put the gun down now.

749
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,860
Oh, for heaven's sake.

750
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,730
Drop the weapon, agent Lisbon.

751
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:23,030
Tiegler, this is your first day out on bail. Don't do this.

752
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,460
Shut up! I said drop it!

753
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:28,030
Best do as she says.

754
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,230
Oh, I'm impressed, Lindsay.

755
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,700
There's not three people in the world

756
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,030
that could've done an induction on a cop.

757
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,760
But Rigsby's guard was up when he was with Dr. Daniel and Carl.

758
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,900
And you?

759
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,600
You just crept through the cracks,

760
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,600
you sneaky little mouse.

761
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:56,360
Well, I was never the sparkling, vivacious one.

762
00:37:56,430 --> 00:37:58,360
That was Mary Beth.

763
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:01,160
And all the boys loved her,

764
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:03,100
never me... 

765
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,900
Until I went to work for Dr. Daniel.

766
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,830
Then I realized I have a talent

767
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,500
for reaching people's unconscious.

768
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,060
People let their defenses down with me.

769
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,100
They trust me.

770
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:18,430
Finally, I was worth something.

771
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,230
Finally, I'm in control.

772
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,930
Look around yourself. Are you in control now?

773
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,430
All these people here have to die.

774
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,700
That's not control. That's madness.

775
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:34,230
You're having a nervous breakdown, Lindsay.

776
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,900
You need help.

777
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:38,500
We can help you.

778
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,330
It's beautiful night for a swim.

779
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,160
Don't you think?

780
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,030
Yeah.

781
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,330
The ocean is so nice tonight.

782
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,200
Hear the crash of the waves, Rigsby? It's peaceful.

783
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:57,200
- Yeah, it's nice.  - It's not nice, Rigsby. It's not the ocean.

784
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:00,200
Hey, now why don't you take Royston for a little swim?

785
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,260
Show him that dark, beautiful ocean.

786
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:05,030
- No.  - That's right. Take him for a swim.

787
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,030
I love night swims. Don't you?

788
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,660
Stop. Rigsby, don't.

789
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,000
Rigsby, listen to me.

790
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,400
Listen to my voice.

791
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:19,530
Why don't you take Jane for a swim? I think he wants to go.

792
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,530
- No, no, no, no. I... I don't want to. I don't wanna go!  - Rigsby!

793
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,000
Come on, let's go swimming, Jane.

794
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,740
- No, no! It's... it's not water down there! It's concrete!  - The water's gorgeous.

795
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,340
- Mr. Jane loves to swim, just like you do, Rigsby.  - Stop, Rigsby. Stop!

796
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,340
Yeah, take him for a swim. Take him over. He wants to go.

797
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,740
- Push him over, Rigsby.  - No, Rigsby! Shark! Shark! There! See it?

798
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,640
- It's a great white.  - Sharks? Where?

799
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,000
- There's no sharks, Rigsby. The water's fine.  - She's lying.

800
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:43,100
- Just take him in! Throw him in!  - She wants you to get eaten.

801
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,800
- Who is this woman?  - Throw him over. Throw him over!

802
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:47,770
Don't...

803
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,300
- Shoulder? Ah, it's the shoulder! Shoulder! Wait! Wait!  - Throw him in, Rigsby!

804
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,140
Gun! Gun! Damn it! 

805
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,540
Yes. Gun. Thanks, Rigsby.

806
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,040
You, my friend, have been in a trance state.

807
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,340
- Get outta here.  - Oh, I'd love to.

808
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,400
Come on. 

809
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:11,070
Let's go.

810
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,600
Jane, would you untie him?

811
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:18,370
Come on.

812
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,740
I don't know. I just suddenly came out of it

813
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,200
And then, uh, boom. Just had to take her down, you know?

814
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,640
Yeah, you took down a 100-pound woman,

815
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,040
- But in that context, you did good.  - What do you mean, "in that context"?

816
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,470
Oh, in the context of someone letting himself get hypnotized,

817
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:41,070
Nearly throwing his colleague off a building

818
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:43,870
And then finally being able to overpower a small crazy woman

819
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,240
To retrieve the situation... you did okay.

820
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,470
Oh, be fair... a small crazy woman with a gun. A gun is a gun.

821
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,740
And anyone can be hypnotized. She was very good.

822
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,670
See? Very good.

823
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,400
Not as good as me, but close. Close-ish.

824
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:59,370
Which is why the professional standards unit

825
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:02,300
Has cleared you for assaulting Dr. Daniel.

826
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,040
You weren't yourself.

827
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,270
But he is now, right? Himself?

828
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,700
Completely unprogrammed?

829
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:11,540
Yes, he is.

830
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,740
Last two days are gone,

831
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:16,670
- But other than that, I'm good to go.  - Oh, so you don't remember anything

832
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,540
From when you were hypnotized?

833
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,540
Fragments, but, no, not really.

834
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,570
Thank goodness, right? 

835
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,270
Yeah.

836
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,700
Oh, lord. Did I make a fool of myself?

837
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:31,470
Cluck like a chicken? I didn't do Tina Turner, did I?

838
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:34,200
No. You were perfectly normal.

839
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:36,040
Oh. Good.

840
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,400
That's a relief, eh? 

841
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,370
Coward.

842
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,540
What?

843
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,740
You honestly don't remember it?

844
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,870
- Don't remember what?  - He remembers.

845
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,470
He so remembers.

846
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,140
What?

847
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,940
It'll come to you.

9999
00:00:0,500 --> 00:00:2,00
