1
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,116
- Thought you'd gone home.
- I wish. We're up.

2
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:23,147
A double homicide in Rancho Rosa.
Local sheriff's in over his head.

3
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,821
- I'm on it.
- Boss,

4
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,443
you've been promising me
more time in the field.

5
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:28,944
Now's as good a time as any.

6
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:32,323
You're right.
Be a cover in the office on this one.

7
00:00:32,697 --> 00:00:33,574
Let's go.

8
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:38,871
- You're okay with this, I hope?
- Absolutely.

9
00:00:52,556 --> 00:00:53,682
What's going on?

10
00:00:53,807 --> 00:00:56,360
Looks like two bullets
to the chest for each of them.

11
00:00:56,485 --> 00:00:58,987
Freshness of the wounds
suggest it happened recently.

12
00:00:59,112 --> 00:01:01,061
Selby and Jana Vickers, 33

13
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,825
and 31 years old,
from here in Rancho Rosa.

14
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:06,094
Identify
from their driver's licenses.

15
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:08,848
- Who found the bodies?
- Couple of teenagers.

16
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:12,403
This place is a local lover's lane.
Apparently, thieves know that, too.

17
00:01:12,966 --> 00:01:14,865
Sheriff thinks
that it's a robbery gone sour.

18
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:17,159
Little old to be necking, no?

19
00:01:17,935 --> 00:01:19,286
There's an age limit on that?

20
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:22,277
Plus their clothes aren't,
disheveled.

21
00:01:23,306 --> 00:01:24,356
Good point.

22
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:27,044
There's a little white thing there,

23
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,951
sticking out from Jana's dress.

24
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:31,510
Could you...
Yeah that's it.

25
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:35,261
$800 dress.

26
00:01:37,132 --> 00:01:39,432
Is that a useful "aha"
or an irritating "aha"?

27
00:01:41,205 --> 00:01:44,015
The borrowed dress tells us
they were going somewhere fancy

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,981
and wanted to make an impression.
Not usually something they'd go for,

29
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,608
or they'd have a later model car.

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,418
He needed a few pulls on the scotch
just to take the edge off

31
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,239
because he was nervous
about who was gonna be there,

32
00:01:56,364 --> 00:01:58,843
which in a small town like this,
likely means

33
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:01,052
relatives or people from his past.

34
00:02:02,563 --> 00:02:04,331
Wedding, maybe?
Or birthday party?

35
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:07,001
- No gift, which leaves...
- No guessing games.

36
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,837
Excuse me, sheriff?

37
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:12,548
What's the name
of the local high school?

38
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:21,553
Stephanie?

39
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,769
You look fantastic.

40
00:02:25,297 --> 00:02:26,771
I'm sorry.
I'm not Stephanie.

41
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:31,859
Do that again, and I'll arrest you.

42
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:35,016
Sorry, I had to.
You've always been the one.

43
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:42,028
I'm not the one.

44
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,280
High school.

45
00:02:53,456 --> 00:02:55,156
Best years of your life.

46
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:08,354


47
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,191
Welcome back to Rancho Rosa High.

48
00:03:12,656 --> 00:03:13,656
Go, Toros!

49
00:03:14,314 --> 00:03:17,380
I'm Tess. One of your student
ambassadors this weekend.

50
00:03:17,505 --> 00:03:19,355
Nametags and reunion books.

51
00:03:19,992 --> 00:03:22,417
We're with the California
Bureau of Investigation.

52
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,509
We need to know
if Jana and Selby Vickers

53
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:27,039
were expected here tonight.

54
00:03:30,041 --> 00:03:32,141
Selby Vickers and his wife Jana.

55
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:34,590
They also replied "yes"
to tomorrow's

56
00:03:34,715 --> 00:03:37,341
homecoming picnic and dance.
Is everything okay?

57
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:40,344
We need to talk to somebody
who would know them.

58
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:44,098
Redheaded woman.

59
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:47,101
That's Willa Brock.
She's the reunion committee chair.

60
00:03:47,269 --> 00:03:50,229
You really think we were young enough
to be in this class, did you?

61
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:54,024
Everyone over the age of 21
looks the same to me.

62
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,238
Tactful and evasive.
You're gonna do very well in life, Tess.

63
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,195
Go, Toros.

64
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:01,870
I'm stunned.

65
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:05,588
It was surprising enough
Selby was even coming.

66
00:04:05,713 --> 00:04:07,715
- Now this?
- Why the surprise?

67
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:10,541
Well, he wasn't
at the fifth or the tenth.

68
00:04:11,807 --> 00:04:12,695
Because...

69
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:15,921
Because he was expelled
and never graduated.

70
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:19,571
Selby pulled this...
It was a really nasty prank.

71
00:04:19,696 --> 00:04:22,190
What was it, senior year?
It was his one and only.

72
00:04:22,315 --> 00:04:24,847
Vice principal Desouza caught him,
gave him the ol'boot.

73
00:04:25,085 --> 00:04:27,600
- What was the prank?
- There was this,

74
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,728
shall we say,
socially challenged boy

75
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,314
- named Derek Logan.
- Selby dragged him

76
00:04:33,482 --> 00:04:35,415
into the girls' locker room,
he blindfolded him

77
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,167
with his own underwear,
tied him up, naked,

78
00:04:39,068 --> 00:04:42,072
took his picture and then
posted it all over the school.

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,268
- How sick is that, right?
- It was disturbing.

80
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:49,498
Is there anything else
you can tell us about him?

81
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:50,873
I played football...

82
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:53,226
Starting running back.
People are still talking

83
00:04:53,351 --> 00:04:55,586
about the 5 touchdowns
I scored against Stratton.

84
00:04:55,754 --> 00:04:57,784
What does
that have to do with Selby?

85
00:04:58,132 --> 00:04:59,131
I was popular.

86
00:04:59,696 --> 00:05:01,746
I was a jock.
He was a nobody.

87
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:04,245
I don't know
what kind of person he was.

88
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:06,764
How about his current life?

89
00:05:07,095 --> 00:05:08,858
<i>I got nada.
I got out of this town</i>

90
00:05:08,983 --> 00:05:11,226
as fast as I could.
I live down in Newport Beach now.

91
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:16,398
How about you, Willa?
Have you heard anything about Selby?

92
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:19,878
I host a daytime
talk show in Chicago

93
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:23,094
that tapes two shows a day
and is about to go national.

94
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:25,783
I'm lucky if I hear anything
about my own family.

95
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:29,191
Derek Logan. That kid
that Selby pulled the prank on.

96
00:05:29,316 --> 00:05:30,930
Could you point him out to us?

97
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,040
Derek Logan?
He's not here?

98
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,287
- No way!
- Gabe,

99
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,294
So good to see you again.

100
00:05:39,285 --> 00:05:40,536
You almost didn't.

101
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:42,883
5 hours I spent
on the 101 driving here.

102
00:05:43,115 --> 00:05:45,886
CBI agent Teresa Lisbon,
Patrick Jane,

103
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:47,638
- this is Gabe Nyland.
- Hi.

104
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:49,735
D.A. for San Diego County.

105
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,710
You've prosecuted
a couple of cases for us.

106
00:05:51,835 --> 00:05:53,978
Now candidate
for Lieutenant Governor of California.

107
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:55,637
Give me the word "g,"

108
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:58,098
I start twisting arms for you
on election day, huh?

109
00:06:00,187 --> 00:06:02,444
Selby Vickers and his wife
were found murdered

110
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:05,224
at the glen... Shot in their car.

111
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:07,134
My god.

112
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:10,308
I hadn't even heard that name
in 15 years till tonight.

113
00:06:10,897 --> 00:06:13,372
- Who did this?
- It's early in the investigation.

114
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:15,683
You just got here, right?

115
00:06:16,443 --> 00:06:19,253
So how is it that you knew
Derek Logan wasn't here?

116
00:06:19,896 --> 00:06:21,892
Derek left the school
and moved out of state

117
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:25,092
after that prank Selby pulled.
Word is he killed himself.

118
00:06:25,758 --> 00:06:26,857
Are you serious?

119
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:29,013
I heard he was a blackjack dealer
at a casino.

120
00:06:29,443 --> 00:06:31,150
We'd like to talk to some classmates

121
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:34,351
that still live in the area.
Maybe they know something about Selby.

122
00:06:34,638 --> 00:06:37,657
There are only a few,
but, the student ambassadors

123
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:40,107
can probably point you
in the right direction.

124
00:06:40,536 --> 00:06:41,950
Thank you for your time.

125
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,912
Nothing jumps out on this,
I'm gonna have the tech guys see it.

126
00:06:50,037 --> 00:06:52,043
Mail's all big bills
and small bank accounts.

127
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:54,413
They certainly weren't
living the high life here.

128
00:06:55,263 --> 00:06:57,090
They didn't need to.
This was home.

129
00:06:57,215 --> 00:06:58,515
They were happy.

130
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:05,424
<i>So I got you next
of kin info on Selby.</i>

131
00:07:06,173 --> 00:07:08,969
Mother in Rancho Rosa.
No luck on Jana, though.

132
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:11,675
<i>- Thanks. Text me the address?
- Will do.</i>

133
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,017
So I've never been
to Rancho Rosa before. What's it like?

134
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:17,015
Nothing special. A town.

135
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,230
Cool. What are you guys doing now?

136
00:07:21,021 --> 00:07:22,721
You know, investigating.

137
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,401
Come here.
Check this out.

138
00:07:24,841 --> 00:07:25,694
I gotta go.

139
00:07:26,474 --> 00:07:28,073
I'm busy... too.

140
00:07:37,431 --> 00:07:39,001
This is from yesterday morning.

141
00:07:40,475 --> 00:07:42,336
<i>I'm done playing games here.
You hear me?</i>

142
00:07:43,078 --> 00:07:45,798
<i>Either you get me my money,
or I'm gonna be forced to take action. </i>

143
00:07:46,853 --> 00:07:48,254
So much for happiness.

144
00:07:51,024 --> 00:07:54,071
So you haven't seen Selby
once in all these years?

145
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:56,110
Supermarket, movie theater maybe?

146
00:07:57,339 --> 00:07:59,520
I mean, if I did, I don't remember.

147
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:01,423
Hard to believe you, Stu.

148
00:08:02,344 --> 00:08:03,107
Sorry?

149
00:08:04,668 --> 00:08:05,609
Really? Okay.

150
00:08:06,182 --> 00:08:08,366
The hair plugs, the heels, this,

151
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:10,948
professional woman here

152
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:13,777
- posing as your girlfriend.
- Wait. What did you just say?

153
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,028
Did he just call me...
What did he say...

154
00:08:16,328 --> 00:08:19,298
- That's all we need for your time...
- Beg my pardon.

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,827
- That's all we have. Thank you.
- I think you look lovely.

156
00:08:22,952 --> 00:08:25,252
- Have a good evening.
- Go, Toros.

157
00:08:27,863 --> 00:08:29,143
What's your problem?

158
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:33,557
It's just a room
full of people lying to each other.

159
00:08:34,226 --> 00:08:37,151
Everyone here is trying so hard
to show how much they've changed,

160
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:38,600
when the mere effort

161
00:08:39,308 --> 00:08:42,111
- screams that they haven't.
- Or they actually do change,

162
00:08:42,236 --> 00:08:45,136
with exceptions like
"Mr. Hair plugs", of course.

163
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:49,653
You got the rebel
who took the bank job,

164
00:08:50,441 --> 00:08:52,496
the player that stays
faithful to his wife.

165
00:08:52,621 --> 00:08:53,949
The rebel took the bank job

166
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,425
because she sees
her rebellion is fruitless.

167
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,659
The player stays faithful
to his wife

168
00:08:58,784 --> 00:09:01,656
because the consequence
of infidelity is much greater now.

169
00:09:02,259 --> 00:09:03,333
But their instincts.

170
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,451
Their instincts never change.

171
00:09:05,576 --> 00:09:07,462
I'm a far cry from
what I was in high school.

172
00:09:08,064 --> 00:09:09,615
I wouldn't be so sure.

173
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:12,316
Driven to succeed to the point
of developing an ulcer,

174
00:09:12,441 --> 00:09:15,604
no tolerance for superiors
less sharp than yourself,

175
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,957
shutting out girls
that wanted to hang out with you,

176
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:20,027
blowing off boys
that want to get close...

177
00:09:20,152 --> 00:09:23,340
All the while,
at every turn, wondering,

178
00:09:23,465 --> 00:09:25,315
"what is it I really want?"

179
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,185
And you played an instrument.
My guess?

180
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,959
- Clarinet.
- Not even close.

181
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:35,936
I'll get the guest list to Rigsby.
I'll have him check everybody out.

182
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:38,368
Have him locate
the whereabouts of Derek Logan.

183
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,984
You really think logan laid
in wait for 15 years

184
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:44,458
and suddenly decided
to take revenge on Selby?

185
00:09:45,514 --> 00:09:48,612
Well, I think that Logan
is as angry today

186
00:09:48,737 --> 00:09:51,996
as he was 15 years ago,
maybe even angrier.

187
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,582
- We'll check him out.
- I'm gonna stick around.

188
00:09:54,707 --> 00:09:57,397
I didn't go to high school.
This is kind of fascinating for me.

189
00:09:57,522 --> 00:09:59,675
- You never went to high school?
- No, I was busy.

190
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,434
You can stay.
Just don't make me sorry I let you.

191
00:10:03,532 --> 00:10:04,441
Bassoon.

192
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:10,192
Mrs. Vickers, when was the last time
you spoke to your son?

193
00:10:12,186 --> 00:10:13,336
This morning.

194
00:10:13,518 --> 00:10:15,760
Selby always checks in on me
before he goes to work,

195
00:10:15,885 --> 00:10:17,709
to see how I'm doing.
He's...

196
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:20,202
Was sweet like that.

197
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,288
Has he any problems?
Work? Personal life?

198
00:10:23,861 --> 00:10:25,588
No. Just the opposite.

199
00:10:25,882 --> 00:10:27,912
Things were starting
to get good for him.

200
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:30,462
After he left high school,
things didn't go right for him.

201
00:10:31,086 --> 00:10:32,788
About high school.
The prank he pulled...

202
00:10:32,913 --> 00:10:34,466
I don't want to talk about that.

203
00:10:35,809 --> 00:10:38,209
His whole life was spoiled
by that...

204
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:39,709
that incident.

205
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,350
He lost a chance at college.

206
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,015
He got stuck working
in a little print shop.

207
00:10:47,529 --> 00:10:49,379
And then Jana came along...

208
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:52,950
and she was like
a whole new world for him.

209
00:10:55,225 --> 00:10:56,675
She encouraged him,

210
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,273
and she told him to strive
for something better.

211
00:11:01,552 --> 00:11:03,578
And he became a whole new person.

212
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:08,680
We haven't been able to
track down any family for Jana.

213
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,669
Do you know where we can find them?

214
00:11:13,614 --> 00:11:15,430
She didn't have anybody...

215
00:11:15,918 --> 00:11:19,011
Nobody that I know of.
She moved here from Poland,

216
00:11:19,694 --> 00:11:22,544
and Selby only met her
a couple of months ago.

217
00:11:23,097 --> 00:11:25,297
A few dates and they got married.

218
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:28,255
It was all kind of a whirlwind.

219
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:31,111
Mrs. Vickers,

220
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:33,933
it's a bit unsettling, but I'd like you
to listen to this message,

221
00:11:34,058 --> 00:11:35,819
see if you recognize the caller.
Okay?

222
00:11:39,914 --> 00:11:42,332
<i>I'm done playing games here.
You hear me?</i>

223
00:11:42,582 --> 00:11:45,272
<i>Either you get me my money,
or I'm gonna be forced to take action.</i>

224
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,286
I've never heard
that voice in my life.

225
00:11:49,522 --> 00:11:52,085
Was my son involved
with a loan shark or something?

226
00:11:52,419 --> 00:11:55,713
Could be. We traced the phone call
to a phone booth in galatin.

227
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:58,759
- That doesn't really tell us...
- Galatin? That's where Jana's from.

228
00:12:00,461 --> 00:12:03,839
Selby met her there at a coffee shop
when he was on a delivery run.

229
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,067
Can you tell us anything about Jana
before she met Selby?

230
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:09,061
Maybe names of friends,
where she worked?

231
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:13,523
No, All that selby told me
was that things were tough for her.

232
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:17,010
He didn't share any details,
probably

233
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:20,345
because he didn't
want me making any judgments.

234
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:26,075
You remember what we used to call you?
You were the frogman.

235
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:28,330
Frog.
Because you played the french horn...

236
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,412
- Yeah.
- No... And 'cause,

237
00:12:30,537 --> 00:12:33,075
you kind a sort a look like a frog,
but no offense.

238
00:12:33,343 --> 00:12:34,950
Yeah, no, I remember.

239
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,963
We used to get on you.

240
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,823
You know what?
I'm sorry about that, sincerely,

241
00:12:40,187 --> 00:12:42,089
but, what?
We were kids, right?

242
00:12:42,214 --> 00:12:45,347
- We were just kids.
- Forget it, forget it. I have.

243
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:47,540
Dude, that time

244
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:49,601
we put the dead bird in his locker.

245
00:12:50,045 --> 00:12:51,050
We did that.

246
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:53,271
Yeah, you guys got me with that one.

247
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,357
Does anybody still call you
"the frogman"?

248
00:12:55,787 --> 00:12:57,980
Pretty much everyone
calls me "Phil,"

249
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,487
except my son, who calls me "dad."

250
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,767
- You fathered a kid?
- He fathered a... Go, frogman!

251
00:13:03,892 --> 00:13:05,241
Come on. Nice!

252
00:13:05,366 --> 00:13:07,159
Good job. Didn't think
you had it in you.

253
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:09,955
Wait. Does he play
the french horn, too?

254
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,931
Because if he does,
you could call him frogboy...

255
00:13:14,805 --> 00:13:16,461
Or... Kermit.

256
00:13:16,939 --> 00:13:17,939
Or Kermie.

257
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,846
Really good to, see you guys again.

258
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:23,463
Come on.

259
00:13:23,712 --> 00:13:25,804
If the kid of yours
ever needs any shaping up,

260
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,348
you send him to
a cordova sports camp, okay?

261
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,185
Vodka tonic, please.

262
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:33,475
Top shelf.

263
00:13:34,753 --> 00:13:35,803
It's on me.

264
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,274
Thank you.

265
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:42,721
You're one of the,
one of the CBI people.

266
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:47,456
I heard about
what happened to Selby.

267
00:13:47,581 --> 00:13:49,119
That's awful.

268
00:13:50,186 --> 00:13:53,250
Well, it doesn't appear
to have dampened the mood here.

269
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,616
L.J. Cordova seems to be
having a great time.

270
00:13:58,319 --> 00:13:59,228
Frogman.

271
00:14:00,365 --> 00:14:03,758
If I could go back in time
and beat the crap out of him

272
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,658
the first time he called me that...

273
00:14:06,571 --> 00:14:07,846
It's not possible, Phil.

274
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:09,451
I know.

275
00:14:11,756 --> 00:14:14,534
But you could just talk
to him quietly

276
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,459
and tell him how you feel.

277
00:14:18,406 --> 00:14:20,965
- He'd probably just laugh at me.
- Probably.

278
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,884
But at least you would know
that you made an effort,

279
00:14:24,009 --> 00:14:27,405
right? And this is a... What?
It's a 15-year school reunion.

280
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:29,242
What are these reunions for, anyway?

281
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:33,274
- I don't know.
- I understand.

282
00:14:33,528 --> 00:14:36,583
All those nights you lay there
not being able to sleep,

283
00:14:36,865 --> 00:14:39,516
thinking about whether or not
you should've confronted him.

284
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:40,872
It's tough.

285
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:44,325
You know what?

286
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,736
You're right.

287
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,222
You go, Phil.

288
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:55,644
- Hey, L.J.
- What up, frog?

289
00:14:56,732 --> 00:14:58,482
What's your problem, man?

290
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:32,222


291
00:15:42,495 --> 00:15:45,195
This thing is
a golden treasury of mullets.

292
00:15:45,805 --> 00:15:46,714
A brawl?

293
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:48,697
You started a brawl?
Come on.

294
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,565
I was going for something
a little more contained,

295
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:55,567
but I guess people just wanted
to explore the physical.

296
00:15:55,692 --> 00:15:57,382
And what information did you glean?

297
00:15:57,507 --> 00:15:59,749
I assume you were testing
some theory or other?

298
00:16:00,203 --> 00:16:04,149
Willa Brock was involved
in eight different school activities,

299
00:16:04,274 --> 00:16:06,841
and she looked pretty good
in cargo pants, which is hard to do.

300
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,067
There are people in the hospital.

301
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:12,156
Yes, but souls were healed.
This was a cathartic brawl.

302
00:16:12,281 --> 00:16:15,640
It was... It was
a therapeutic expression of...

303
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,309
Please.

304
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:20,273
Got a lead.
Jana's INS entry records

305
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:22,591
list a galatin address
as her destination...

306
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,779
The property and residence
of a Terence Badali.

307
00:16:24,904 --> 00:16:27,381
No real sheet, but he had
a couple restraining orders

308
00:16:27,506 --> 00:16:29,871
from women back in the '90s.
He could be our angry caller.

309
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:32,204
- Go to Galatin. Go with Van Pelt.
- Okay.

310
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:34,868
You, go to hell.
Take a toothbrush.

311
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,286
Which way is that?

312
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,406
I'll go.

313
00:16:42,638 --> 00:16:43,839
What's so funny?

314
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,020
"If I want culture,
i'll leave my yogurt out overnight."

315
00:16:47,145 --> 00:16:49,445
L.J. Cordova's yearbook photo quote.

316
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,886
When you're done entertaining yourself,
I got your Derek Logan update

317
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,104
right here.

318
00:16:55,728 --> 00:16:57,521
Kid's life never turned the corner.

319
00:16:57,646 --> 00:17:00,259
Derek Michael Logan left Rancho Rosa

320
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:03,977
a couple weeks after the Selby incident.
Family moved to Virginia.

321
00:17:04,163 --> 00:17:07,129
He became a heroin addict.
Couple years in and out of rehab.

322
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,411
He died of an overdose
on his 23rd birthday.

323
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:12,538
School office has sent over
his old student ID.

324
00:17:12,663 --> 00:17:14,074
From their archives.

325
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,867
He looks like you.

326
00:17:16,982 --> 00:17:19,456
And, this is the photo
of the incident

327
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:21,848
that, Selby plastered
around the school.

328
00:17:21,973 --> 00:17:24,223
How does any kid recover from that?

329
00:17:27,198 --> 00:17:29,248
Well, in this case, they don't.

330
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,007
How sad.

331
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,410
And I was betting on
derek logan as our killer.

332
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,463
Will you quit yanking me around?

333
00:17:37,588 --> 00:17:39,641
If you can't get it right,
we're through.

334
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:43,813
Now the order was for 5/16th beech wood,
not for 5/16th warped beech wood.

335
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,669
Hey, Terence Badali? CBI.

336
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:48,858
Need to talk to you
about Jana Vickers.

337
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,111
I'll call you back.
What about her?

338
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,049
You left a threatening message
on her answering machine recently.

339
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:55,532
How do you know it was me?

340
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,179
Because an innocent person
would say, "i didn't do it."

341
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:01,403
- So what? I called her, big deal.
- You called her and threatened her.

342
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,249
Now she and her husband have
been found killed, and so...

343
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:16,451
You're under arrest.

344
00:18:22,844 --> 00:18:25,314
I panicked. As soon as
you told me they were dead,

345
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,981
I knew you were gonna blame me,
and my brain said, "just run."

346
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,543
Your brain's a fool.
Where were you last night?

347
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:32,568
I was watching college ball.

348
00:18:34,434 --> 00:18:35,741
Can you prove that?

349
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,198
Notre Dame sucked.

350
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,637
I live alone...

351
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:43,538
Since that polish bitch left me.

352
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,675
- Had you a sexual relationship?
- She was my fiancée.

353
00:18:47,622 --> 00:18:49,312
I met her through
this internet service.

354
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:52,050
You pay a lot of money,
but you get to choose from these videos,

355
00:18:52,175 --> 00:18:54,674
and they bring her over
to the country, and she marries you.

356
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,927
- That's a good deal.
- I tell you, man,

357
00:18:57,052 --> 00:19:00,180
these eastern european types...
They know how to take care of their men.

358
00:19:00,655 --> 00:19:02,056
Right. What happened?

359
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,414
She left me for this Vickers guy.

360
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:08,104
She comes to me one day, says she met
this guy at work, they fell in love...

361
00:19:08,383 --> 00:19:10,509
- Must've made you angry.
- Yeah, you bet it did.

362
00:19:10,634 --> 00:19:12,933
So you threaten
to kill them unless they pay you off.

363
00:19:13,496 --> 00:19:15,594
I threatened
to turn her in to the INS,

364
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:18,475
because she had lied about
all these things on her form.

365
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,617
She was in this country
under false pretenses.

366
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,754
- How much were you asking for?
- I wanted my money back.

367
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:25,905
The money I put up
to get her over here.

368
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,630
I saved all my receipts.
It was 25 grand.

369
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:32,003
- And 5 grand for emotional suffering.
- And what was her response?

370
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,631
She said they'd pay.
She admitted she owed me the money.

371
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,383
They were broke. Any idea
where they were gonna get the money?

372
00:19:37,837 --> 00:19:40,553
Jana said that Selby was gonna get it
from an old friend.

373
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,669
They guaranteed badali
they'd have it for him monday, in cash.

374
00:19:44,015 --> 00:19:46,682
At least we know Selby's
sudden interest in the reunion.

375
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:49,687
He was protecting his wife.
It's kind of romantic.

376
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:51,862
- Noble, even.
- Motive, even.

377
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:55,510
He must have asked somebody for money
who really didn't like him asking.

378
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,048
Nice work, grace.

379
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,865
I need to see that list of all
the reunion attendees' arrival times.

380
00:20:02,516 --> 00:20:03,451
Here you go.

381
00:20:04,194 --> 00:20:04,994
Thanks.

382
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,997
You and Cho saw some action?

383
00:20:08,307 --> 00:20:10,134
- Little bit, yeah.
- That's cool.

384
00:20:11,469 --> 00:20:14,426
You have Gabe Nyland arriving by plane
the day before the murder.

385
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:15,471
Are you sure?

386
00:20:15,596 --> 00:20:17,717
There's an airfield in stratton,
the next town over.

387
00:20:17,842 --> 00:20:20,067
I checked the arrival logs.
He flew in by private jet.

388
00:20:20,192 --> 00:20:22,437
Be careful who you vote for
for lieutenant governor.

389
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:24,211
One of the candidates lies.

390
00:20:38,033 --> 00:20:39,901
It's agent Lisbon and Patrick Jane.

391
00:20:40,026 --> 00:20:42,670
We just have a few
follow-up questions for you.

392
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:49,873
Hi. How can I help?

393
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,993
Last night at the reception,
you said you'd just gotten in,

394
00:20:53,186 --> 00:20:55,962
but we know you flew in
the day before the murders.

395
00:20:56,352 --> 00:20:58,006
Can you explain the discrepancy?

396
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,335
Come on in.

397
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,729
I came a day early
for a private fund-raising dinner.

398
00:21:07,671 --> 00:21:09,981
I said i'd just arrived,
because I didn't want

399
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:13,332
my classmates thinking i'm up here
shilling during reunion weekend.

400
00:21:13,856 --> 00:21:16,858
Nice room.
Is it the presidential suite?

401
00:21:19,077 --> 00:21:20,452
Something like that.

402
00:21:20,971 --> 00:21:23,114
Is the bedroom nice?
How's the mattress?

403
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:24,741
It's adequate.

404
00:21:25,345 --> 00:21:27,702
- Can I see it?
- No, why would you want to?

405
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:30,538
- Why not?
- Because I'm entitled to my privacy.

406
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,647
Hello again.

407
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,303


408
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,849
There was
no inappropriate relationship.

409
00:21:50,115 --> 00:21:52,208
You call it
an inappropriate relationship.

410
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,896
The law calls it
soliciting sex from a minor.

411
00:21:55,696 --> 00:21:57,117
She came to my door,

412
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,409
had an idea she wanted to discuss about
a youth voter effort for my campaign.

413
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:04,733
I'm not going to discourage some
kid who wants to get involved.

414
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:07,617
- No, you hide 'em in your bedroom.
- I had to.

415
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:10,647
Media people follow me
everywhere I go now.

416
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:13,114
If I open the door and it's some
guerrilla photographer,

417
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:15,959
our faces end up on the internet,
both of our lives are ruined.

418
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:17,555
You're very good at this.

419
00:22:17,996 --> 00:22:21,146
Selling a case with passion,
even though it holds no water.

420
00:22:21,704 --> 00:22:24,081
Explains why
you're such a successful DA.

421
00:22:24,815 --> 00:22:25,802
It's the truth.

422
00:22:26,113 --> 00:22:27,879
That should be easy to confirm.

423
00:22:28,856 --> 00:22:32,016
Could you have the social worker
bring Tess in, please?

424
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:33,282
No, please.

425
00:22:36,277 --> 00:22:38,523
This is on me.
She didn't ask for any of this.

426
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:40,886
You care about her.

427
00:22:41,772 --> 00:22:43,747
You genuinely care about her.

428
00:22:44,325 --> 00:22:45,655
She's very friendly...

429
00:22:46,471 --> 00:22:47,715
And diplomatic.

430
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:50,618
Diplomatic.

431
00:22:51,601 --> 00:22:53,869
And evasive, like a politician...

432
00:22:54,733 --> 00:22:55,832
Like her father.

433
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,800
And you have
the same shape front teeth.

434
00:22:59,925 --> 00:23:01,712
They are your real teeth,
aren't they?

435
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:05,125
She's your daughter?

436
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,696
Her mother was a year behind me.

437
00:23:12,864 --> 00:23:16,020
Tess was born a few weeks
before I graduated.

438
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:18,409
Families agreed to keep it quiet.

439
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:22,017
I've always done right by Tess.
Come out to see her whenever I can.

440
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,443
Discreetly, of course.

441
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:25,445
Did you ever see Selby
when you visited?

442
00:23:26,418 --> 00:23:28,813
Last year, at a gas station
just outside of town.

443
00:23:28,938 --> 00:23:31,166
We said a quick hello,
went our separate ways.

444
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:35,204
Maybe Selby found out about Tess,
threatened to expose you.

445
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:36,711
Not Selby Vickers.

446
00:23:37,052 --> 00:23:38,563
He wouldn't threaten a fly.

447
00:23:39,145 --> 00:23:40,411
A super nice guy.

448
00:23:40,943 --> 00:23:42,456
He tried to do right by people.

449
00:23:42,581 --> 00:23:44,589
What'd you talk about
at the gas station?

450
00:23:44,968 --> 00:23:45,884
Small talk.

451
00:23:46,009 --> 00:23:48,479
I told him I was gonna run
for lieutenant governor, and he

452
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:50,887
offered to print the campaign flyers,
for free.

453
00:23:51,055 --> 00:23:53,443
- Was he the same way in high school?
- Always...

454
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:57,079
Help you with your homework,
he'd share his lunch with you, he was...

455
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,401
just happy
knowing that you liked him.

456
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,743
Even that thing with logan,
he just did it to be popular.

457
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,474
I've answered all your questions.

458
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:08,529
I think you should go.

459
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,603
- What?
- Come on.

460
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:15,737
Sorry.

461
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:17,313
Very nice to meet you.

462
00:24:17,438 --> 00:24:19,754
Your politics are a roiling mess
of greed and cynicism,

463
00:24:19,879 --> 00:24:21,929
but you have a lovely daughter.

464
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:47,977
Him again.

465
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,625
I'll take care of it.

466
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:02,583
Willa, right?
Regional tv personality.

467
00:25:05,328 --> 00:25:06,961
Anything I can help you with?

468
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:08,781
I'm here for the big game.

469
00:25:08,906 --> 00:25:10,258
Football... I love it!

470
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,510
How goes the investigation?

471
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,308
Oh, my colleagues are pursuing
several leads...

472
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,672
Nothing definitive yet.

473
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,520
Mr. Jane, this is a weekend
of celebration.

474
00:25:23,621 --> 00:25:26,789
Your presence is making
a few people uncomfortable.

475
00:25:27,675 --> 00:25:28,818
Should I go away?

476
00:25:29,048 --> 00:25:30,736
Should I leave...

477
00:25:31,806 --> 00:25:34,092
Selby and Jana unavenged

478
00:25:34,943 --> 00:25:37,535
because of some low comfort levels?
Is that what you're saying?

479
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,622
What are you saying then?

480
00:25:43,821 --> 00:25:45,044
Never mind.

481
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:47,250
I have a question.

482
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,161
How are the burgers?

483
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,124
The burgers are good.
Very good.

484
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:12,234
Vice principal Desouza,

485
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:14,289
do you mind if I join you?

486
00:26:15,684 --> 00:26:17,742
Look at you.
All grown-up.

487
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,199
Sit down.

488
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,662
Tell me what
you've been up to these days.

489
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,050
Nice cover.

490
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:25,585
I didn't actually attend
this school.

491
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:28,753
In fact, I didn't attend
any high school. I'm with the CBI.

492
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,193
Oh, please, please.

493
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:32,339
These reunions are insufferable.

494
00:26:33,245 --> 00:26:35,364
What I wouldn't give
to be home on my couch,

495
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:37,774
glass of wine, good book.

496
00:26:39,308 --> 00:26:42,301
I take it you heard about Selby Vickers
and his wife.

497
00:26:43,672 --> 00:26:45,368
That's... that's a tragedy.

498
00:26:46,381 --> 00:26:48,231
Selby was a truly good kid,

499
00:26:49,062 --> 00:26:51,120
until that one incident
with Derek Logan.

500
00:26:52,095 --> 00:26:54,245
Derek Logan was definitely
a different kind of duck.

501
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,678
He wore the same tattered jacket,
be it hot or cold,

502
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:59,098
always hugged the wall
as he walked down a hallway.

503
00:26:59,709 --> 00:27:00,656
He was off.

504
00:27:01,336 --> 00:27:03,344
"Off" isn't tolerated
in high school.

505
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:06,896
Certainly not in the 30 years
I've been doing this job.

506
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,458
Right over there is where
it all happened.

507
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,811
Derek's folks sent him to
a shrink afterwards...

508
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,450
But it didn't help.

509
00:27:20,288 --> 00:27:22,317
A month later,
they pulled him out of school.

510
00:27:22,442 --> 00:27:24,289
That was the last I heard of him.

511
00:27:36,969 --> 00:27:39,094
Did Selby ever give
a reason why he did it?

512
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:40,956
You know, I asked him,

513
00:27:41,081 --> 00:27:44,286
but he just shrugged. You know, gave me
that teenage "i don't know."

514
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,558
How'd you catch him?

515
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,087
- Derek was blindfolded, right?
- Yes.

516
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:56,048
He heard
his attacker's voice, though.

517
00:27:56,943 --> 00:27:58,728
He thought it sounded like Selby.

518
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:02,455
I confronted Selby.
He confessed quite readily, like the

519
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:05,067
helpful, honest boy he usually was.

520
00:28:06,386 --> 00:28:07,543
It's very strange.

521
00:28:13,147 --> 00:28:15,010
You want me to memorize
everything we have

522
00:28:15,135 --> 00:28:17,520
on all 67 alumni
that showed up at the reunion?

523
00:28:17,739 --> 00:28:20,036
- Yes, I do.
- And how would I do that?

524
00:28:20,535 --> 00:28:22,825
It's easy.
You build a memory palace.

525
00:28:23,528 --> 00:28:26,504
- It was a card player's trick.
- Well, it's multipurpose.

526
00:28:26,629 --> 00:28:29,237
It's perfect for recalling
a large body of information.

527
00:28:29,362 --> 00:28:32,209
All you need is a physical
location that you know well,

528
00:28:32,643 --> 00:28:35,676
and you break it down
in your mind into smaller pieces

529
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:37,440
and link each one

530
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,307
to a package of the information,

531
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:42,025
like this.

532
00:28:45,912 --> 00:28:47,496
I walk in the door,

533
00:28:48,558 --> 00:28:51,642
and I'm greeted by
reunion chair Willa Brock...

534
00:28:52,379 --> 00:28:54,982
Former class president,
debate team captain,

535
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,251
led the team to
three county championships,

536
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:59,275
now a talk show host in Chicago.

537
00:28:59,933 --> 00:29:01,408
I sit down at the table

538
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,387
and catch up with Dana Greer.
Swimmer,

539
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,469
now a realtor in Los Angeles,

540
00:29:06,594 --> 00:29:08,805
married to a gentleman
by the name of Arthur.

541
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,206
And so on and so forth.

542
00:29:11,977 --> 00:29:14,186
When you want
to remember the details,

543
00:29:14,635 --> 00:29:17,085
you close your eyes,
and in your mind,

544
00:29:18,213 --> 00:29:19,344
you walk around

545
00:29:19,469 --> 00:29:21,369
your very own memory palace.

546
00:29:23,566 --> 00:29:25,787
I can't learn all this
stuff in just a couple hours.

547
00:29:25,912 --> 00:29:28,007
It comes very quickly
once you get the hang of it,

548
00:29:28,132 --> 00:29:30,148
- and they'll be wearing nametags.
- But why?

549
00:29:30,273 --> 00:29:32,408
- Why would I memorize all these...
- It's fun.

550
00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:36,559
This is some dubious scheme
that Lisbon doesn't know about,

551
00:29:36,684 --> 00:29:38,109
You can count me out.

552
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:40,277
Sorry, you gotta do it.

553
00:29:40,887 --> 00:29:41,863
No, I don't.

554
00:29:45,932 --> 00:29:47,526
If you don't cooperate,

555
00:29:47,651 --> 00:29:50,471
i'm gonna be forced to tell
Lisbon about you and Van Pelt.

556
00:29:50,596 --> 00:29:52,823
Tell what?
There's nothing to tell.

557
00:29:56,165 --> 00:29:57,104
Really?

558
00:29:57,538 --> 00:29:59,663
Yeah. I don't know
what you're talking about.

559
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:04,792
Contrary to very strict
CBI rules and regulations,

560
00:30:04,917 --> 00:30:06,487
you and Grace Van Pelt

561
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,277
are engaged in an illicit affair.

562
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:11,605
Nope.

563
00:30:12,402 --> 00:30:13,992
You're being childish.

564
00:30:16,185 --> 00:30:18,636
- Don't tell her. She'll report to HR.
- She's a stickler.

565
00:30:18,761 --> 00:30:21,390
- They'll throw one of us off the unit.
- Better get to work.

566
00:30:50,547 --> 00:30:52,908
School would be so much more fun
if they started the day

567
00:30:53,033 --> 00:30:56,168
with this every morning
instead of the pledge of allegiance.

568
00:30:56,293 --> 00:30:58,670
Or maybe they could
just integrate the two

569
00:30:58,795 --> 00:31:01,230
into the "dance of allegiance."

570
00:31:02,470 --> 00:31:05,091
We're taking a real flier here.
This better work.

571
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,125
Timpani.

572
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,742
Really got me stumped on that one.

573
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:11,463
I'm just guessing now.

574
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:14,224
We'd better get this thing going
before people start leaving.

575
00:31:14,349 --> 00:31:16,933
Patience.
The fun will commence shortly.

576
00:31:23,844 --> 00:31:25,152
Hey, how's it going?

577
00:31:26,231 --> 00:31:28,190
Nice to see you.
Long time.

578
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:34,702
Coffee machine.

579
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,246
Stu McAlpine?

580
00:31:39,996 --> 00:31:43,567
How goes it with my favorite
photo club president?

581
00:31:43,914 --> 00:31:47,162
- It goes great. How goes it with you?
- It goes whatever's better than great.

582
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,821
I forgot your name.

583
00:31:49,593 --> 00:31:50,743
Well, it's...

584
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:52,850
Derek Logan.

585
00:31:57,512 --> 00:31:58,999
And it's great to be back.

586
00:32:05,606 --> 00:32:06,632
How are you?

587
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:15,867
This is gonna be good.

588
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:17,667
I promise.

589
00:32:19,576 --> 00:32:20,396


590
00:32:20,942 --> 00:32:22,469
Great to see you, too, man.

591
00:32:22,594 --> 00:32:25,502
Derek Logan.
I can't believe it.

592
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:27,410
You've changed.
Who would've thought

593
00:32:27,535 --> 00:32:29,701
that the girl who brought
four schools to their knees

594
00:32:29,826 --> 00:32:32,585
in the high school county debate finals
would be lost for words?

595
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,451
You just look so different.

596
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:38,007
Let's just chalk it up to 15 years'
worth of solid hours at the health club,

597
00:32:38,132 --> 00:32:40,103
plus maybe a little bit of work.

598
00:32:40,228 --> 00:32:42,162
You gotta look good
in my business, huh?

599
00:32:42,287 --> 00:32:45,165
Had to see
it to believe it. Derek Logan!

600
00:32:45,754 --> 00:32:46,925
L.J., hey!

601
00:32:47,476 --> 00:32:48,932
- Refrigerator.
- What?

602
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:50,705
Rancho Rosa versus Stratton...

603
00:32:51,136 --> 00:32:53,783
The ball is on our 10,
2 seconds on the clock,

604
00:32:53,908 --> 00:32:55,785
sims hands it off, bam!

605
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,221
You run 90 yards,
touchdown, toros win.

606
00:32:59,189 --> 00:33:01,542
You're half right.
That was against Deerfield.

607
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:04,451
And it was a pass, not a handoff,
but it was close.

608
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:07,451
Man!
That's Derek "freakin" Logan!

609
00:33:09,157 --> 00:33:11,167
I'm gonna make the rounds
to say some hellos,

610
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:12,948
but it is great to see you guys!

611
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:21,057
- You're a natural.
- I can't do this.

612
00:33:21,182 --> 00:33:23,587
You're doing it.
You ready for phase two?

613
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,638
I can't.

614
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:27,652
Think of it this way.
You mess up, we blow the case,

615
00:33:27,777 --> 00:33:28,985
and I tell Lisbon.

616
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,758
You're a cold bastard,
you know that?

617
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,593
Good evening, fellow Toros!

618
00:33:37,561 --> 00:33:40,320
Now is the part of the evening
you've all been waiting for,

619
00:33:40,744 --> 00:33:42,262
the achievement awards!

620
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,104
As voted by you,

621
00:33:48,229 --> 00:33:49,985
The 15th reunion class

622
00:33:50,198 --> 00:33:51,932
of Rancho Rosa High!

623
00:33:55,628 --> 00:33:56,729
Break a leg.

624
00:33:57,261 --> 00:33:58,648
Our first award,

625
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,241
the "i can't believe
they're still together" award,

626
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:04,676
- which goes to...
- Dave Mercer and Angie Diaz Mercer.

627
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:07,044
No surprises there,
am I right, gang?

628
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:10,422
- What are you doing?
- I'm let you finish, Willa.

629
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,408
I just wanna say a few quick words.

630
00:34:12,831 --> 00:34:14,411
- Just make it fast.
- Sure.

631
00:34:14,536 --> 00:34:16,021
Slight change of schedule.

632
00:34:16,146 --> 00:34:18,771
We'll get right back to the awards,
but first,

633
00:34:18,896 --> 00:34:20,192
Derek Logan!

634
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:28,244
I'm sure most of you
are scratching your heads,

635
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,858
wondering why I'm here.

636
00:34:31,361 --> 00:34:33,361
I came here tonight because...

637
00:34:34,008 --> 00:34:36,664
I wanted to see how it felt like
to be here again.

638
00:34:36,789 --> 00:34:38,867
I'm not the same person
I was 15 years ago,

639
00:34:39,516 --> 00:34:41,995
so when I walked in
that front door tonight, it felt good.

640
00:34:44,368 --> 00:34:45,277
Thank you.

641
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:46,818
But...

642
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,739
as soon as I set my eyes
on you people,

643
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,618
I remember how it felt
the last time I walked out that door,

644
00:34:53,743 --> 00:34:55,175
and I was that sad,

645
00:34:55,431 --> 00:34:56,881
defeated kid again.

646
00:34:57,792 --> 00:34:58,701
Sure,

647
00:34:58,886 --> 00:34:59,886
go ahead.

648
00:35:00,096 --> 00:35:01,496
Feel sorry for me.

649
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:03,658
But you should also
feel sorry for Selby,

650
00:35:03,783 --> 00:35:05,644
may he rest in peace.

651
00:35:06,725 --> 00:35:08,063
About a month ago,

652
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,443
Selby called me.

653
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,612
He'd been trying to track me down
for months, he said.

654
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,154
He wanted to apologize

655
00:35:15,322 --> 00:35:17,022
and to tell the truth...

656
00:35:19,979 --> 00:35:21,979
The truth that never came out.

657
00:35:22,856 --> 00:35:24,856
You see, Selby was a follower,

658
00:35:25,263 --> 00:35:26,348
not a leader,

659
00:35:26,611 --> 00:35:28,188
and he did what he did because

660
00:35:28,313 --> 00:35:30,150
somebody else was there that day.

661
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,004
Somebody told him to do
what he did to me.

662
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,797
Yeah... That's right.

663
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:36,144
Hey, Gina, what's up?

664
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,111
He'll be fine. Just...

665
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:42,196
Give him an aspirin.

666
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:45,150
And I now know who it was.

667
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:46,828
And that...

668
00:35:46,953 --> 00:35:48,903
is the real reason I am here.

669
00:35:49,237 --> 00:35:50,237
I am here

670
00:35:50,373 --> 00:35:52,065
to make you pay.

671
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,830
You ruined my life,

672
00:35:56,887 --> 00:35:57,696
that day.

673
00:35:58,073 --> 00:36:00,282
And... I've spent 15 years

674
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:02,910
struggling to get it back.
And now, I have.

675
00:36:03,930 --> 00:36:05,111
And I will have

676
00:36:05,236 --> 00:36:06,399
my revenge.

677
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:07,672
Payback

678
00:36:07,797 --> 00:36:08,999
is a bitch,

679
00:36:09,504 --> 00:36:11,084
like in that movie with...

680
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:15,390
Mel Gibson,
where they kidnap his child.

681
00:36:16,524 --> 00:36:18,724
Or is it the other one?
Anyhow...

682
00:36:19,014 --> 00:36:21,415
that's me.
Enjoy the rest of your evening.

683
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:22,540
Go, Toros.

684
00:36:28,162 --> 00:36:31,157
- What do you think you're doing?
- The maid lent us this.

685
00:36:31,282 --> 00:36:33,582
You still should tip her.
It's the right thing to do.

686
00:36:33,707 --> 00:36:35,198
Must've been hard walking out

687
00:36:35,323 --> 00:36:37,923
in the middle
of a big event you planned.

688
00:36:38,141 --> 00:36:41,123
The speech was boring,
and I have to get back to Chicago.

689
00:36:41,248 --> 00:36:43,898
I have two shows
to prepare for on monday.

690
00:36:44,521 --> 00:36:46,721
I have a great idea for your show.

691
00:36:47,059 --> 00:36:50,259
"Humiliating pranks
and the people who initate them."

692
00:36:51,149 --> 00:36:53,049
You could be your own guest.

693
00:36:55,059 --> 00:36:56,725
You have no basis for that.

694
00:36:57,126 --> 00:36:59,840
I didn't want to have to hear Derek
go on and on about...

695
00:36:59,965 --> 00:37:02,415
Did your talk show
goes national soon?

696
00:37:03,192 --> 00:37:04,101
So?

697
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,096
If Selby had gone to the media
with the story

698
00:37:07,221 --> 00:37:09,756
of how you brutalized
a helpless boy,

699
00:37:09,881 --> 00:37:12,377
your big chance would be history.

700
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:16,398
So you arranged a meeting
with Selby to get the money.

701
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:19,350
Jana showed up with him,
which you weren't expecting,

702
00:37:19,475 --> 00:37:21,175
so you killed them both.

703
00:37:22,468 --> 00:37:24,491
I didn't have to pay him
or kill him.

704
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:29,749
Selby didn't have a stitch of proof
putting me in that locker room.

705
00:37:30,344 --> 00:37:33,000
The media would've ignored him
as a crackpot.

706
00:37:33,506 --> 00:37:35,656
"I have immortal longings in me."

707
00:37:37,345 --> 00:37:38,788
Do you remember that quote?

708
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:41,653
It's Shakespeare.

709
00:37:42,605 --> 00:37:45,455
I think it was the quote
in my yearbook photo.

710
00:37:45,815 --> 00:37:47,065
And an apt one.

711
00:37:47,383 --> 00:37:49,349
High school was a wonderful time
for you.

712
00:37:50,357 --> 00:37:51,476
You could say that.

713
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:54,741
Star student, class president,
champion debater...

714
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:57,042
You were at the top
of the social hierarchy.

715
00:37:57,167 --> 00:38:00,611
Willa Brock was the queen of the school.
Your world was perfect.

716
00:38:04,411 --> 00:38:07,001
But then something happened
and unsettled that perfect world.

717
00:38:07,126 --> 00:38:08,176
Derek Logan

718
00:38:08,943 --> 00:38:10,692
irked you, somehow.

719
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:14,530
And you just couldn't let it pass
without a response,

720
00:38:14,655 --> 00:38:16,207
so you turned on the charm,

721
00:38:16,332 --> 00:38:19,120
you manipulated Selby
to do your bidding, knowing...

722
00:38:19,245 --> 00:38:21,315
that he'd be thrilled
to help the popular girl.

723
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,240
The girl he was always
a little in love with.

724
00:38:25,815 --> 00:38:27,957
And then you destroyed Derek Logan,

725
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:30,032
to the delight of your peers.

726
00:38:30,491 --> 00:38:31,941
And you enjoyed it,

727
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:35,002
'cause you found it all so easy

728
00:38:35,127 --> 00:38:37,688
and so empowering and exciting,

729
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,209
right?

730
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:42,923
All your success
at Rancho Rosa High...

731
00:38:43,378 --> 00:38:44,279
This...

732
00:38:45,324 --> 00:38:47,532
was Willa Brock's
crowning achievement.

733
00:38:58,106 --> 00:38:59,456
You've aged well.

734
00:39:01,868 --> 00:39:03,836
It looks like Selby
took more than one photo

735
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:06,301
that day in the locker room,
didn't he?

736
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,136
Have a look at that.

737
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,554
Check that out.

738
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:36,415
This is Selby's proof.

739
00:39:37,652 --> 00:39:39,873
But you didn't wanna pay him
all that money and risk him

740
00:39:39,998 --> 00:39:42,580
blackmailing you again,
so you killed him

741
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:43,922
and his wife Jana.

742
00:39:47,618 --> 00:39:50,804
Kinda poetic,
how you were done in by your own vanity.

743
00:39:54,124 --> 00:39:55,354
Derek Logan

744
00:39:55,595 --> 00:39:57,728
told everyone I let him touch me...

745
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,521
Like I ever would.

746
00:40:01,756 --> 00:40:03,650
I was deeply humiliated.

747
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,468
So you ruined his life.

748
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:08,408
And Selby and Jana Vickers
had to die, too.

749
00:40:08,805 --> 00:40:11,284
Selby falls
for that little polish girl

750
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,259
and suddenly grows a spine?

751
00:40:15,193 --> 00:40:18,498
Things would have been perfect
if he just stayed lonely and pathetic.

752
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:22,645
Close call.

753
00:40:22,979 --> 00:40:25,538
If she'd have destroyed
the negative that Selby had given her,

754
00:40:25,663 --> 00:40:28,669
- we'd have no evidence and no case.
- It was a trophy.

755
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:31,430
It was a reminder
that the great W. Brock can crush anyone

756
00:40:31,555 --> 00:40:34,126
that dares stand in her way,
just like 15 years ago.

757
00:40:35,070 --> 00:40:37,670
Nobody advances an inch
from high school, you proved your point.

758
00:40:37,795 --> 00:40:39,644
Their instincts never change.

759
00:40:42,994 --> 00:40:44,900
Selby and Derek
would both be grateful.

760
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:48,612
You two have an open invitation
if you want to join us at the 20th.

761
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,637
Hopefully, we won't need to.

762
00:40:51,036 --> 00:40:52,836
Keep it in the dojo, Phil.

763
00:40:54,144 --> 00:40:55,474
One thing I don't get.

764
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:58,340
How did you persuade Rigsby
to play this charade?

765
00:40:58,465 --> 00:41:01,846
I told him that you promised
to give him monday off.

766
00:41:02,529 --> 00:41:03,627
Not happening.

767
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,924
Well, that puts me
in an awkward position.

768
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,267
I held up my end of the bargain.

769
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Oh, God.

770
00:41:14,708 --> 00:41:16,458
I used to love this song.

771
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,673
- Loved the song.
- I used to love this song.

772
00:41:19,798 --> 00:41:22,698
You love this song.
Obviously, you wanna dance.

773
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:24,729
With you? No.

774
00:41:25,337 --> 00:41:28,724
Come on, you can pretend
that I'm that mean, cold-hearted guy

775
00:41:28,849 --> 00:41:31,446
that you used to worship from afar,
but never talked to.

776
00:41:36,933 --> 00:41:38,183
No funny stuff.

777
00:41:39,807 --> 00:41:40,773
Really?

778
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:57,426
Trumpet?
