1
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,815
Anyplace. the suspect
can leave the body anyplace,

2
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,317
And they dump it
on the only state land

3
00:00:19,385 --> 00:00:22,320
Within hundred miles of here,
making it ours. great.
why is that a bad thing?

4
00:00:22,388 --> 00:00:25,190
Oh, come on.
you saw the body.
(cho) it's a coincidence.

5
00:00:25,258 --> 00:00:28,193
(rigsby) nah.
jane taught me one thing...
hi. what do we got?

6
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,096
The, uh, victim's name is
emma plaskett, 19, local girl.

7
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:33,131
First responder knew her
from high school.

8
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,133
Lives at home
with her parents,

9
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,369
Has an older brother
and a twin sister, maya,

10
00:00:37,436 --> 00:00:40,338
Who went missing
at the same time.
their car was found abandoned
last night on the roadside,

11
00:00:40,406 --> 00:00:43,341
Ten miles north of here.
who's coordinating
the local search?

12
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:46,244
Sheriff hardy here is
in charge.
ed hardy. good to meet you.

13
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:49,247
Lisbon. patrick jane.
this is van pelt.
well, we called in
all our people,

14
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:51,883
And we got volunteers
rendezvousing at the station.

15
00:00:51,951 --> 00:00:55,420
All our resources are directed
to finding the twin sister.

16
00:00:55,488 --> 00:00:57,022
Lisbon.

17
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,524
Look.

18
00:01:04,597 --> 00:01:06,565
Oh, damn.
yeah.

19
00:01:06,632 --> 00:01:09,301
No, it-it's a coincidence.
that's what i said.

20
00:01:09,368 --> 00:01:12,604
No. no such thing
as a coincidence, not with him.
what are you all
talking about? who's "him"?

21
00:01:12,672 --> 00:01:16,041
Red john. he's a serial killer.
this is his style of cutting.

22
00:01:16,108 --> 00:01:18,910
Look at the toenails.
yeah, i see them.

23
00:01:18,978 --> 00:01:21,246
Painted in her own blood,
just like my wife.

24
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:24,416
This is red john, and he wants
to make sure i was on this case.
it's strange,
i'll give you that,

25
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:27,152
But you're jumping
to conclusions. okay?

26
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:30,922
There's no way
we can know for sure...
(airplane engine whirring)

27
00:01:31,923 --> 00:01:32,923
What the hell?

28
00:01:35,924 --> 00:01:36,924
Oh my God.

Thx to subs-team.tv for the transcript.

30
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:10,010
Man, this nicotine gum is
like chewing on a tire.

31
00:02:10,078 --> 00:02:12,012
What do we know about
the family?

32
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,748
Old money. mr. plaskett's
an architect, mom's a sculptor.

33
00:02:14,816 --> 00:02:16,750
There's been
plasketts in this county

34
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,752
Since before
there was a county,

35
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,255
Which means something
to people around here.

36
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:25,192
Been here ten years.
i'm still the new guy.

37
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,462
(woman) have you found maya?
is she all right?

38
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,963
Where is she?

39
00:02:30,031 --> 00:02:32,766
We don't know as of yet,
but every effort is being--

40
00:02:32,834 --> 00:02:35,102
Where is she?
(man) they don't know
where she is.

41
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,137
We have to let them
do their job.

42
00:02:37,205 --> 00:02:39,573
Uh, can we take a look
at your girls' bedrooms?

43
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:41,375
Yes, of course.

44
00:02:41,443 --> 00:02:43,444
Thank you.
come on, mrs. plaskett.

45
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:48,048
Here it is.

46
00:02:48,116 --> 00:02:49,817
We, uh...

47
00:02:49,884 --> 00:02:52,319
We tried having them sleep
in separate bedrooms,

48
00:02:52,387 --> 00:02:53,821
But it never took.

49
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:55,723
They preferred
being together.

50
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,258
In your professional judgment,

51
00:02:58,326 --> 00:03:01,428
Do you think that maya
is dead also?
yes.

52
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:04,732
We keep an open mind.
we're assuming that she's alive.

53
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:06,500
There's always hope.

54
00:03:06,568 --> 00:03:09,770
Not much.

55
00:03:09,838 --> 00:03:11,638
I see.

56
00:03:13,308 --> 00:03:15,409
Well,
thank you for your candor.

57
00:03:18,179 --> 00:03:19,480
Mr. plaskett?

58
00:03:19,547 --> 00:03:22,483
Perhaps your wife needs you
to be with her right now.

59
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,351
Yes, of course.

60
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:29,523
Why so cruel?

61
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:31,759
Statistically,
it's dad that did it.

62
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:34,028
Well, since when do you care
about statistics?

63
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:35,929
I just wanted
to raise his pulse a little.

64
00:03:35,997 --> 00:03:38,332
Hold on.
this is a red john case.

65
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,135
The cutting style, the painted
toenails, the skywriting--

66
00:03:41,202 --> 00:03:43,837
You put it all together,
it's hard to dismiss.

67
00:03:43,905 --> 00:03:47,675
Yeah, it's red john, all right,
but someone else is involved.

68
00:03:47,742 --> 00:03:50,244
Else, why would he change
his m.o. so radically?

69
00:03:50,311 --> 00:03:51,645
Skywriting?

70
00:03:51,713 --> 00:03:53,647
He wanted to make sure
that the cbi,

71
00:03:53,715 --> 00:03:55,649
<i>that you,
would be put on this case.</i>

72
00:03:55,717 --> 00:03:58,585
He's obviously trying to
lure you into some kinda trap.

73
00:03:58,653 --> 00:04:01,522
Well, that's part of it,
but why take them from a car

74
00:04:01,589 --> 00:04:03,991
Instead of catching them
at home alone,

75
00:04:04,059 --> 00:04:06,994
Like he's always done before?
and why two victims at once?

76
00:04:07,062 --> 00:04:09,897
Twins? why break pattern?
well, he's broken pattern
once before.

77
00:04:09,964 --> 00:04:11,899
Yes,
because it was personal.

78
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,901
He wanted to punish me.

79
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:15,903
I don't think these girls
are random targets.

80
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,005
I think there's something
personal behind this.

81
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:22,209
Red john either knows them
or knows someone close to them.

82
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:28,215
(engine whirring)

83
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:43,998
(engine turns off)
hey.

84
00:04:44,065 --> 00:04:47,868
Hey.
you the pilot who drew that face
over san angelo two hours ago?

85
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:50,671
That was me.
how'd it look? clean?

86
00:04:50,739 --> 00:04:54,041
Good and round?
why'd you do that,
draw the face?

87
00:04:54,109 --> 00:04:55,743
I-i got an internet order

88
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,112
From some company
up in san francisco--

89
00:04:58,179 --> 00:05:01,582
R-jay solutions, inc.,
i think they were called.
r-jay?

90
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,585
Yeah. they paid the full $1,250
up-front by cash transfer.

91
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:07,354
So what's this about?
do you have an address
for r-jay?

92
00:05:07,422 --> 00:05:11,258
Yes, ma'am,
i do, in my office.
great.

93
00:05:14,029 --> 00:05:16,230
There's a brother?

94
00:05:16,297 --> 00:05:18,699
Yes. he's on his way down.
he lives up in parkersville.

95
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:20,134
Boyfriends?

96
00:05:20,201 --> 00:05:23,537
They had boyfriends,
but nobody serious.

97
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:25,606
Anyone at the moment?

98
00:05:25,674 --> 00:05:28,375
No, nobody right now.

99
00:05:28,443 --> 00:05:31,645
No, it can often be hard
for boys to have a chance.

100
00:05:31,713 --> 00:05:33,747
They're such a strong couple.

101
00:05:33,815 --> 00:05:37,551
But still,
very different characters.

102
00:05:37,619 --> 00:05:40,254
Yes... if you know them well.

103
00:05:40,322 --> 00:05:42,156
Emma...

104
00:05:42,223 --> 00:05:45,592
Darker, moodier,
the risk-taker.

105
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,896
Maya--she's a happier soul,
more cautious,

106
00:05:48,963 --> 00:05:51,332
Uh... more conservative.

107
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,733
Yes.

108
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:54,735
How do you know that
about them?

109
00:05:54,803 --> 00:05:57,738
Well, i tell you that, uh,
only so you'll know

110
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:00,607
That there isn't any point
in lying to us.

111
00:06:00,675 --> 00:06:03,143
Lying?
why would we lie to you?

112
00:06:03,211 --> 00:06:05,679
Arden, do you always follow
your husband's lead?

113
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:08,949
Do you never struggle
against his desire to control?

114
00:06:09,017 --> 00:06:11,485
Excuse me?
just 'cause
you drink too much

115
00:06:11,553 --> 00:06:14,488
Doesn't mean you don't have
a say. i mean, i should think

116
00:06:14,556 --> 00:06:17,925
He's at least half the reason
you drink in the first place.

117
00:06:17,993 --> 00:06:20,694
Yeah? a good man,
but cold, pious.

118
00:06:20,762 --> 00:06:23,197
You know,
possession of that badge

119
00:06:23,264 --> 00:06:26,667
Does not excuse you from acting
with normal human decency.
quiet, noah.

120
00:06:26,735 --> 00:06:28,168
Just be quiet.

121
00:06:28,236 --> 00:06:29,770
(arden sighs)

122
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:33,507
(voice breaks) we've been
ashamed to talk about this,

123
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:36,343
But for a few months,
our girls have been mixed up...

124
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,379
With drugs...

125
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:42,516
And the low sort of people
that come along with that.

126
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:45,653
Drake, our son,
heard that emma

127
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,056
Was romaically involved
with a dubious character.

128
00:06:49,124 --> 00:06:51,525
She denied it, totally.

129
00:06:51,593 --> 00:06:54,161
So we don't really know
for sure--

130
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:57,064
Exactly.
we do not know for sure.
do you know his name?

131
00:06:57,132 --> 00:07:00,701
Mace... guthrie.

132
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:04,004
I know a guthrie.
small-time thief.

133
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,342
Here it is.
it's guthrie's place.

134
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,010
Nice, isn't it?

135
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:11,612
You carry a gun?

136
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,113
No, never.

137
00:07:13,181 --> 00:07:15,349
You hang back a tad, huh?
oh, yeah, sure.

138
00:07:15,417 --> 00:07:17,151
Duke.

139
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:21,155
All right, we're gonna do this
nice and easy.
(lisbon) okay.

140
00:07:31,399 --> 00:07:34,335
Guthrie?
(resumes knocking)

141
00:07:34,402 --> 00:07:36,503
Come on, guthrie. open up.

142
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:49,616
(barking)

143
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,124
(continues barking)

144
00:07:57,192 --> 00:08:00,694
(clank)
freeze!

145
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:02,696
Aah!

146
00:08:02,764 --> 00:08:06,200
(dog continues barking)

147
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,636
Whoa. you okay, duke?

148
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:11,338
I'm okay.

149
00:08:11,406 --> 00:08:14,074
Shake it off, big guy.

150
00:08:14,142 --> 00:08:16,043
(door rattles)

151
00:08:16,111 --> 00:08:19,146
That's a very loyal dog.

152
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:20,714
(cho) your store is listed

153
00:08:20,782 --> 00:08:23,584
As the mailing address
for r-jay solutions, inc.

154
00:08:23,652 --> 00:08:25,319
Yes. okay.

155
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:27,921
Suite 121?

156
00:08:27,989 --> 00:08:29,590
Sure.

157
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:35,796
Uh, no, ma'am, uh, a suite is
like a room or an office.

158
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:37,998
A suite is a box.

159
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:40,300
You're a small company,
you look big.

160
00:08:40,368 --> 00:08:42,469
Okay,
we need to open box 121,

161
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:45,406
And we need all the information
you have on who rented it.

162
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:47,441
No problem.
you have a warrant?

163
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:50,944
Ma'am, this is
a murder investigation.
we can get a warrant,
but that takes time,

164
00:08:51,012 --> 00:08:54,114
And time is
of the essence here.
no problem. go get a warrant.
i'll be here.

165
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:56,950
Following the law.

166
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:00,621
You have a wife?

167
00:09:00,689 --> 00:09:02,790
No.
i have a niece.

168
00:09:02,857 --> 00:09:04,792
Thanks. that's okay.

169
00:09:04,859 --> 00:09:07,861
When you come back,
i show you a picture.

170
00:09:07,929 --> 00:09:09,229
Very pretty.

171
00:09:09,297 --> 00:09:10,698
Thank you.

172
00:09:13,735 --> 00:09:15,602
Okay, open it up.

173
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,771
You got it.

174
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,876
(ed) be careful now, duke.

175
00:09:27,482 --> 00:09:30,818
(barking)

176
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:42,496
(dog continues barking, snarls)

177
00:09:47,535 --> 00:09:50,637
(continues barking)

178
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,075
Shh.

179
00:09:57,912 --> 00:09:59,380
(ed) hey, buddy.

180
00:09:59,447 --> 00:10:02,016
Easy, boy. easy, boy.
you got something?

181
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:07,588
(continues barking)

182
00:10:10,725 --> 00:10:13,727
(barking continues)

183
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:19,700
(whimpers)

184
00:10:23,338 --> 00:10:26,040
Hands up.
okay. okay. okay. okay.

185
00:10:26,107 --> 00:10:29,076
Ohh, who's a good boy?
that's a good dog.

186
00:10:29,144 --> 00:10:31,111
(panting)

187
00:10:41,385 --> 00:10:42,819
What?

188
00:10:47,658 --> 00:10:50,460
Emma and maya plaskett.

189
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,131
What about 'em?
you didn't hear?

190
00:10:55,199 --> 00:10:56,800
What?

191
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,802
Emma was found horribly murdered
this morning,

192
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:00,537
And maya is missing.

193
00:11:02,406 --> 00:11:04,774
Oh, my god.

194
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:06,776
Were you having
a sexual relationship

195
00:11:06,844 --> 00:11:08,945
With either of them?

196
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:10,480
No.

197
00:11:10,548 --> 00:11:12,182
Really?

198
00:11:12,249 --> 00:11:14,017
No. never.

199
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:16,653
Maybe hung out with them
a couple times. that's it.

200
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:19,089
Mace...

201
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:21,091
I see you care
for both of them,

202
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:23,326
And i can see
that you're lying to me.

203
00:11:23,394 --> 00:11:24,828
That's a bad idea.

204
00:11:24,895 --> 00:11:28,398
I got nothing to do
with this.

205
00:11:28,466 --> 00:11:30,333
Please understand something.

206
00:11:34,405 --> 00:11:38,875
<i>i have a very deep
personal interest in this case.</i>

207
00:11:40,478 --> 00:11:42,445
I'll do whatever it takes.

208
00:11:42,513 --> 00:11:44,447
I will have you
framed for murder.

209
00:11:44,515 --> 00:11:47,550
I will torture you. i will
kill you myself if i have to--

210
00:11:47,618 --> 00:11:49,552
Whatever it takes.

211
00:11:54,225 --> 00:11:56,159
(sighs) oh, jeez, lisbon.

212
00:11:56,227 --> 00:11:58,795
Come on. this is on tape.
control your man there.

213
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:01,798
Cut him some slack.
look, he's just playing the guy.

214
00:12:01,866 --> 00:12:03,833
He doesn't mean it.
doesn't he?

215
00:12:03,901 --> 00:12:07,504
You know what red john does
to him. he can't think straight.

216
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:10,240
He would do all that he said
and more, if you let him.

217
00:12:10,307 --> 00:12:12,842
I won't let him.

218
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,010
Emma and me had a thing.

219
00:12:14,078 --> 00:12:16,246
Mm-hmm.

220
00:12:16,313 --> 00:12:19,382
<i>she, um, i don't know
what she saw in me,</i>

221
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,384
<i>but she liked me, you know?</i>

222
00:12:21,452 --> 00:12:25,422
(crying) both of those girls
had a way about 'em.

223
00:12:25,489 --> 00:12:28,191
They look at you
like they really see you.

224
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:29,659
(whispers) yeah.

225
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:33,963
So me and emma had been
hookin' up for about a month,

226
00:12:34,031 --> 00:12:36,032
And i get a phone call,

227
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,034
From some guy
that i don't know,

228
00:12:38,102 --> 00:12:40,236
Saying, "stay away from her
or else,"

229
00:12:40,304 --> 00:12:43,740
And he hangs up
before i can tell him to eat it.
can you describe his voice?

230
00:12:43,808 --> 00:12:45,442
Uh, soft...

231
00:12:45,509 --> 00:12:46,776
Quiet.

232
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:48,712
Did you do what he said?

233
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,714
No, of course not.

234
00:12:50,781 --> 00:12:53,216
I kept seeing her.

235
00:12:53,284 --> 00:12:56,219
And then i wake up one morning
a couple weeks later,

236
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:58,254
And there's a pig's head
lying next to me.

237
00:12:58,322 --> 00:13:00,724
I lock and bolt my doors
every night.

238
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:03,126
There's no way
somebody gets in there,

239
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:04,627
But they did.

240
00:13:04,695 --> 00:13:07,297
It's mental. right?

241
00:13:07,365 --> 00:13:11,434
The thing is, me and emma were
on the down low.

242
00:13:11,502 --> 00:13:13,003
Nobody knew.

243
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,405
She insisted on that.

244
00:13:15,473 --> 00:13:17,407
So how did he know?

245
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:20,477
He must have been spying on her
real close.

246
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,784
How did you people know?

247
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,972
(knock on door)

248
00:13:52,176 --> 00:13:53,643
Good morning.
morning.

249
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:56,813
I'm drake plaskett.
i'm maya and emma's brother.

250
00:13:56,881 --> 00:13:59,783
Agent lisbon. this is jane.
patrick jane.

251
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,451
Have you found maya?

252
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,620
No, ma'am.
but i can assure you,

253
00:14:03,688 --> 00:14:06,323
We're continuing the search
with every available resource.

254
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,125
Please come in.

255
00:14:11,195 --> 00:14:13,129
Where have you
been looking for her?

256
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:15,565
I wouldn't know that,
ma'am.

257
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:19,602
To clarify, the cbi conducts
the investigative aspects.

258
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,104
Sheriff hardy is

259
00:14:21,172 --> 00:14:23,640
Very ably investigating
the physical search.

260
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,644
And sheriff hardy will call us
if he has news, mom.

261
00:14:27,712 --> 00:14:29,646
How can we help you,
agent lisbon?

262
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:33,016
You told us it was drake
who told you about guthrie.

263
00:14:33,084 --> 00:14:35,819
Yes.
(lisbon)
how'd you know about him?

264
00:14:35,886 --> 00:14:37,821
Uh, about a month ago,
i'd say,

265
00:14:37,888 --> 00:14:41,324
I was staying the weekend,
overheard the girls talking,

266
00:14:41,392 --> 00:14:44,828
Emma telling maya that this
guthrie character was dangerous,

267
00:14:44,895 --> 00:14:46,730
And she should be careful.

268
00:14:46,797 --> 00:14:49,065
Naturally, i was very concerned.
i told my parents.

269
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:51,768
And then we decided
to confront emma about it.

270
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:54,204
I see. if you could sit down
with us, drake,

271
00:14:54,271 --> 00:14:56,373
And give us a statement,
it'd be really helpful.

272
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,108
Of course.
anything you need.

273
00:15:06,417 --> 00:15:09,119
I'm just gonna go take
another look at the girls' room,

274
00:15:09,186 --> 00:15:11,554
If i may.
of course.

275
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:12,922
Sure.

276
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,192
Lisbon!

277
00:16:22,259 --> 00:16:24,461
Lisbon!

278
00:16:28,666 --> 00:16:31,001
What?

279
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:32,469
A camera,
microphone transmitter.

280
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:35,872
Someone was spying
on our daughters?
yeah.

281
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,674
Who had access to this room?

282
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:41,011
Nobody. just us
and janine, the housekeeper.

283
00:16:41,078 --> 00:16:42,412
Nobody else?

284
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,047
No. nobody.

285
00:16:44,115 --> 00:16:46,182
Drake,
how's your electronic skills?

286
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:50,053
<i>you're accusing me of this?
let's be fair here.
you're the likeliest suspect.</i>

287
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:54,290
You can see that.
you did say you overheard
an intimate private conversation

288
00:16:54,358 --> 00:16:57,227
Between the two of them.
no, they're my little sisters.
i love them.

289
00:16:57,294 --> 00:17:00,063
(patrick)
no one's doubting that.
where were you
night before last?

290
00:17:00,131 --> 00:17:02,365
At home, alone--
no, wait.

291
00:17:02,433 --> 00:17:04,367
Wait. there was a break-in
eight months ago.

292
00:17:04,435 --> 00:17:07,470
That's right.
they broke the kitchen door
to get in.

293
00:17:07,538 --> 00:17:10,573
They took some cash,
some liquor, broke a few vases.

294
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:12,976
We just assumed it was
teenagers on a spree.

295
00:17:13,044 --> 00:17:16,379
That'd be a good cover.
did you report it to the police?

296
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:19,049
Yes, we did,
and the sheriff will confirm it.

297
00:17:19,116 --> 00:17:21,151
(cell phone rings)
excuse me.

298
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:24,154
(ring)
(lisbon) hey.

299
00:17:24,221 --> 00:17:27,157
We got the warrant. we're about
to open the mailbox.

300
00:17:27,224 --> 00:17:30,160
Yeah, jane said he wanted to be
on the line when we opened it.

301
00:17:30,227 --> 00:17:33,596
Okay. one minute.

302
00:17:33,664 --> 00:17:35,231
My niece.

303
00:17:35,299 --> 00:17:37,334
Beautiful, like a movie star,

304
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,002
But well-behaved.

305
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:40,904
Yeah, she's attractive.

306
00:17:40,971 --> 00:17:44,708
Oh, yeah. go for it, man.
i'm not looking to get married
right now, ma'am.

307
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:48,745
Thank you, though.
yeah, i'm still here.
mm-hmm. you ready, ma'am?

308
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,347
(mouths words)

309
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:53,350
Uh, yeah, open up.
(clears throat)

310
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:57,120
Okay. uh, it's an envelope.

311
00:18:00,491 --> 00:18:02,425
It's typewritten,
postmarked hattiesburg,

312
00:18:02,493 --> 00:18:03,994
20th of december,

313
00:18:04,061 --> 00:18:06,629
Addressed to roy tagliaferro.

314
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:13,737
"dear roy, i found this address
on a business card of yours

315
00:18:13,804 --> 00:18:15,739
"that i discovered
down the back of the sofa.

316
00:18:15,806 --> 00:18:18,742
"and so i write to you today
in the faint hope

317
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:21,745
That this letter may find you.
if it does..."
"and you are reading this,

318
00:18:21,812 --> 00:18:24,748
I just want to say that
i still love you very much,

319
00:18:24,815 --> 00:18:26,750
"despite the very cruel way
you treated me,

320
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:29,519
"and i hope you will come back
to me one day.

321
00:18:29,587 --> 00:18:33,123
With all my heart, rosalind."

322
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:37,260
It's him.

323
00:18:37,328 --> 00:18:39,262
I know it.

324
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,830
I know it.

325
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:44,267
This roy tagliaferro is
red john.

326
00:18:44,335 --> 00:18:46,336
We don't know that.

327
00:18:46,404 --> 00:18:49,272
Well, we know red john
killed emma,

328
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:52,275
So we can assume that red john
hired the skywriter.

329
00:18:52,343 --> 00:18:55,912
The skywriter was given
the order by r-jay solutions.

330
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,350
R-jay solutions is
ray tagliaferro.

331
00:19:00,418 --> 00:19:03,420
Hence, roy tagliaferro is
red john.

332
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:04,788
Maybe.

333
00:19:04,855 --> 00:19:07,791
This woman, rosalind,
has seen red john.

334
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:10,627
Lisbon, she--
she knows red john.

335
00:19:10,695 --> 00:19:12,629
This is him.

336
00:19:17,068 --> 00:19:19,202
(piano playing classical music)

337
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:22,172
Are you sure this is
the right rosalind?
there's only two rosalinds
in the hattiesburg phone book.

338
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:25,175
The other one's 73 and married.

339
00:19:25,242 --> 00:19:27,143
(knocks on door)

340
00:19:30,214 --> 00:19:32,315
Rosalind harker?
yes?

341
00:19:32,383 --> 00:19:34,718
We're with the california
bureau of investigation.

342
00:19:34,785 --> 00:19:36,720
May we come in?

343
00:19:36,787 --> 00:19:38,655
Would you show me
some i.d. please?

344
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:53,686
(rosalind) roy tagliaferro?

345
00:19:55,956 --> 00:19:57,423
What are you investigating?

346
00:19:57,491 --> 00:20:00,693
We're with the homicide
and serious crimes unit.

347
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:02,895
What can you tell us
about roy?

348
00:20:02,963 --> 00:20:05,564
Not a thing until you tell me
why you want to know.

349
00:20:05,632 --> 00:20:09,435
We believe he could be a serial
murderer named red john.

350
00:20:09,503 --> 00:20:12,405
No.

351
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:14,407
That's absurd.

352
00:20:14,474 --> 00:20:16,409
(lisbon) may we come in?
no.

353
00:20:16,476 --> 00:20:19,512
No, ma'am, we're not leaving.
(rosalind)
you don't know him.

354
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:21,814
Ma'am? ms. harker?

355
00:20:21,882 --> 00:20:24,650
I'm not listening.
i don't hear you.

356
00:20:24,718 --> 00:20:26,185
(lisbon) ma'am?

357
00:20:26,253 --> 00:20:30,856
Ms. harker?

358
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:32,992
Rosalind?
go away.

359
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:35,060
I can't do that.

360
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,964
There is a girl missing.

361
00:20:39,032 --> 00:20:41,033
Her name is maya. she's 19.

362
00:20:41,101 --> 00:20:43,536
Her sister has already
been killed by red john.

363
00:20:43,603 --> 00:20:47,373
We don't know, but he might have
her captive somewhere.

364
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:55,681
This... man, red john...

365
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:58,017
Killed my wife and child.

366
00:20:58,085 --> 00:21:00,286
That's why i'm here,
rosalind.

367
00:21:00,353 --> 00:21:02,388
That's why i can't leave.

368
00:21:05,926 --> 00:21:08,060
(sighs)

369
00:21:15,669 --> 00:21:17,903
I'm sorry.

370
00:21:17,971 --> 00:21:20,172
That's terrible.

371
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:45,765
I'm blind,

372
00:21:45,832 --> 00:21:48,200
<i>but i'm not blind.</i>

373
00:21:48,268 --> 00:21:50,569
I'm a good judge
of human nature.

374
00:21:50,637 --> 00:21:52,138
I have to be.

375
00:21:53,707 --> 00:21:55,708
I know roy very well.

376
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:00,646
I know him intimately.

377
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:08,454
And i'm sure,
as sure as...

378
00:22:08,522 --> 00:22:10,623
This ground
beneath my feet...

379
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,327
I know that roy is
a good man.

380
00:22:18,698 --> 00:22:20,499
I believe you.

381
00:22:23,603 --> 00:22:26,772
Uh, i'm sorry.

382
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,340
That's okay.

383
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:33,813
We all make mistakes.
god knows.

384
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:39,952
Maybe this red john is just
using roy's identity somehow.

385
00:22:41,688 --> 00:22:45,057
If we could find roy, maybe he
could help us find red john.

386
00:22:47,594 --> 00:22:50,996
Roy came to my door one day

387
00:22:51,064 --> 00:22:53,332
When his car had broken down
off the road.

388
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,268
(liquid pours)
he needed
to use the telephone.

389
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:58,504
So i made him some lemonade,

390
00:22:58,572 --> 00:23:02,808
And we got talking about
classical music,

391
00:23:02,876 --> 00:23:05,077
And...

392
00:23:05,145 --> 00:23:08,114
(chuckles) he didn't leave
for two days.

393
00:23:08,181 --> 00:23:10,750
You two were lovers?

394
00:23:10,817 --> 00:23:12,118
Yes.

395
00:23:12,185 --> 00:23:14,887
That's very brave of you.

396
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:16,922
I have to be.
how long were you together?

397
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,092
Roy was in my life for...

398
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,094
About five months.

399
00:23:22,162 --> 00:23:24,230
He would come and go
as he pleased,

400
00:23:24,297 --> 00:23:27,800
Said he was doing business
in the area.
what kind of business?

401
00:23:27,868 --> 00:23:29,435
He didn't say.

402
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:31,971
You didn't ask?
you weren't curious?

403
00:23:32,038 --> 00:23:33,572
No.

404
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,143
I didn't care. i don't live
in your world. i live here.

405
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:39,145
I was glad when he came,

406
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:40,379
Sad when he left.

407
00:23:40,447 --> 00:23:43,716
You said in your letter
that he was cruel to you.

408
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:47,820
Very cruel.

409
00:23:47,888 --> 00:23:50,289
He left

410
00:23:50,357 --> 00:23:53,058
And just never came back.

411
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:54,894
Never said good-bye,

412
00:23:54,961 --> 00:23:57,630
Why he was leaving
or where he was going.

413
00:23:57,697 --> 00:23:59,732
Just vanished.

414
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,967
It's been
nearly six months now.

415
00:24:02,035 --> 00:24:03,436
Can you describe him?

416
00:24:03,503 --> 00:24:06,806
Just under 6 feet tall...

417
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:10,643
Not muscular,
but not soft either...

418
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,978
Short, straight hair...

419
00:24:13,046 --> 00:24:14,747
A gentle voice...

420
00:24:14,815 --> 00:24:17,016
Rough, strong hands.

421
00:24:17,084 --> 00:24:19,585
He smelled of...

422
00:24:19,653 --> 00:24:22,188
Pine and...

423
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:23,656
Nails and earth.

424
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:26,559
(chuckles) and he liked
to listen to me play the piano.

425
00:24:26,626 --> 00:24:28,160
What was his favorite music?

426
00:24:28,228 --> 00:24:31,630
Bach.
he admired his rigor.

427
00:24:31,698 --> 00:24:35,601
Did anybody see him?
a mailman, a cleaning lady?

428
00:24:35,669 --> 00:24:37,336
No.

429
00:24:37,404 --> 00:24:39,505
I lead
a fairly solitary life.

430
00:24:39,573 --> 00:24:42,508
Did he ever mention any friends,
people from work?

431
00:24:42,576 --> 00:24:45,778
No.

432
00:24:45,846 --> 00:24:48,848
He did bring a friend of his
over once, though,

433
00:24:48,915 --> 00:24:50,716
For thanksgiving.

434
00:24:50,784 --> 00:24:52,218
Dumar.

435
00:24:52,285 --> 00:24:54,954
Dumar. any other name?

436
00:24:55,021 --> 00:24:57,656
Just dumar.

437
00:24:57,724 --> 00:24:59,658
Couldn't believe
a blind woman could cook.

438
00:24:59,726 --> 00:25:01,894
Came over especially to see.

439
00:25:01,962 --> 00:25:03,963
Can you recall anything else
about him?

440
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,898
He smoked a lot.

441
00:25:05,966 --> 00:25:09,335
He said he was trying to quit,
but he smoked so much,

442
00:25:09,403 --> 00:25:12,571
He had to run out to the store
to buy more cigarettes.

443
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:14,507
(laughs) when he came back,

444
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:16,509
He had bought
a stuffed toy elephant

445
00:25:16,576 --> 00:25:20,146
As a gift for me.

446
00:25:20,213 --> 00:25:22,348
That was a good day.

447
00:25:22,416 --> 00:25:25,818
Roy came a couple more times
after that,

448
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:28,654
And then that was it.

449
00:25:28,722 --> 00:25:30,055
Gone.

450
00:25:30,123 --> 00:25:33,592
Do you still have it?
the stuffed elephant.

451
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,594
Yes, i do.

452
00:25:41,935 --> 00:25:44,303
First thing in the morning,

453
00:25:44,371 --> 00:25:46,906
Check on all the convenience
stores in that area.

454
00:25:46,973 --> 00:25:48,908
It was a few months ago,

455
00:25:48,975 --> 00:25:51,444
But it's possible someone will
remember selling the elephant

456
00:25:51,511 --> 00:25:54,046
<i>and cigarettes together.
it was thanksgiving.</i>

457
00:25:54,114 --> 00:25:56,048
Yes, sir.
you got it, chief.

458
00:25:56,116 --> 00:25:59,585
And don't lose the elephant.
she wants it back.
all right.

459
00:25:59,653 --> 00:26:01,654
You know, it's ironic
that she was blind.

460
00:26:01,721 --> 00:26:03,923
How is that ironic?

461
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,591
Whatever. it's messed up.

462
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:08,727
You know, it'd be funny
if it wasn't... not... funny.

463
00:26:08,795 --> 00:26:10,596
I mean...

464
00:26:10,664 --> 00:26:12,598
(minelli)
any luck on this end?

465
00:26:12,666 --> 00:26:14,800
Nope. there's nobody
named roy tagliaferro

466
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:17,803
Anywhere on the database.
it must be an alias.

467
00:26:17,871 --> 00:26:20,706
Try the name in english.
tagliaferro means "cut iron."

468
00:26:20,774 --> 00:26:22,475
Thank you, sir.
it's a good idea.

469
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:25,044
Yes, it is.

470
00:26:25,112 --> 00:26:27,546
(playing bach's
"prelude in 'c' major

471
00:26:27,614 --> 00:26:30,516
From "the well-tempered
clavier")

472
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:33,452
¶

473
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,028
(song ends)

474
00:27:29,176 --> 00:27:30,976
(beep)

475
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:36,315
Boss, i think i found something.

476
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:38,317
Overnight i set up
and ran a code script

477
00:27:38,385 --> 00:27:41,587
To search the probate court's
realty transaction records.

478
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:43,589
I got a hit
on the name "cut iron."

479
00:27:47,494 --> 00:27:50,329
Well?

480
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:52,665
We have a good lead.

481
00:27:52,732 --> 00:27:54,767
Eight months ago, around
the time tagliaferro showed up,

482
00:27:54,835 --> 00:27:56,969
And old farm property was
bought, called sparrow's peak,

483
00:27:57,037 --> 00:27:59,839
And it was bought
by cut iron properties.

484
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:01,107
Let's go.

485
00:28:01,174 --> 00:28:02,608
Wait. there's more.

486
00:28:02,676 --> 00:28:05,111
A company credit card
in the same name was used

487
00:28:05,178 --> 00:28:07,313
To purpose a large truckload
of construction supplies.

488
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,715
Nails, earth, pine.
he's building something.
slow down.

489
00:28:09,783 --> 00:28:12,485
We need to find a judge
and get a search warrant.
sure thing.

490
00:28:12,552 --> 00:28:15,521
Judge felton over in eckerville
will be the quickest, probably.
we don't have time for that.

491
00:28:15,589 --> 00:28:17,823
No choice.
look, no warrant, no case.

492
00:28:17,891 --> 00:28:19,892
We could catch red john,
and he could walk.

493
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,461
If we catch red john, he's not
walking anywhere. he's mine.

494
00:28:22,529 --> 00:28:25,564
Don't talk like that. i can't
let you anywhere near this case

495
00:28:25,632 --> 00:28:29,034
If you start talking crazy
like that.
crazy? you're crazy if you think
you're gonna stop me.

496
00:28:29,102 --> 00:28:30,870
Red john is mine.

497
00:28:30,937 --> 00:28:34,540
You try to stand in my way,
and you--you will regret it.

498
00:28:34,608 --> 00:28:37,643
Are you threatening me?
no, i am just saying
that if you stand in my way,

499
00:28:37,711 --> 00:28:40,513
You will--
i've had it with you
and your egotistical crap!

500
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,515
This isn't about justice
or the law or fighting evil.

501
00:28:42,582 --> 00:28:46,385
This is about you and your
wounded pride. i'm done with it.

502
00:28:46,453 --> 00:28:48,587
Eckerville, judge felton.
right?

503
00:28:48,655 --> 00:28:51,190
Yes, ma'am.

504
00:28:51,258 --> 00:28:55,394
If he does anything wrong,
if he jaywalks--shoot him.

505
00:28:58,365 --> 00:28:59,432
Wow.

506
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:01,100
Steamed up.

507
00:29:01,168 --> 00:29:03,202
Yeah.

508
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,205
Let's go.
oh, hold on.
i don't know about that.

509
00:29:06,273 --> 00:29:09,208
What if maya's waiting out there
for someone to help her?

510
00:29:09,276 --> 00:29:12,511
What if she dies while we're
standing here doing nothing?

511
00:29:14,181 --> 00:29:16,649
All right, let's do it.

512
00:29:16,716 --> 00:29:17,750
Right.

513
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:26,959
What's this--
store number ten?

514
00:29:27,027 --> 00:29:28,761
11.

515
00:29:28,829 --> 00:29:30,429
(sighs)

516
00:29:30,497 --> 00:29:32,431
What a waste of time.

517
00:29:32,499 --> 00:29:34,500
It's worth trying.

518
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:38,938
Excuse me, sir.
do you have, uh--

519
00:29:39,005 --> 00:29:40,506
Sorry. no returns.

520
00:29:40,574 --> 00:29:43,008
Excuse me?
you buy the elephant,
you keep the elephant.

521
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:44,310
You sold this elephant?

522
00:29:44,377 --> 00:29:48,414
Yeah. last year.
it was a good item.

523
00:29:48,482 --> 00:29:52,184
Comes in elephants, bears,
rodents--$9.95.
well, last thanksgiving,
do you recall a customer

524
00:29:52,252 --> 00:29:54,687
Buying this elephant
and some cigarettes?

525
00:29:54,755 --> 00:29:58,090
No. how would i do that?
am i an elephant?

526
00:29:58,158 --> 00:30:00,459
You can look
at the surveillance tape,

527
00:30:00,527 --> 00:30:03,129
If you like.
you have the tape
from five months ago?

528
00:30:03,196 --> 00:30:05,264
Yeah.
yeah, we'd love
to see the tape, yeah.

529
00:30:05,332 --> 00:30:07,199
My son's
a big techno-nerd.

530
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:09,969
We got state-of-the-art
cameras on a 9-month loop.

531
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:18,978
(parking brake engages,
engine turns off)

532
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:27,486
7654 sparrow peak.

533
00:30:27,554 --> 00:30:29,688
This is the place.

534
00:30:29,756 --> 00:30:31,657
Let's go.

535
00:30:33,794 --> 00:30:36,529
Okay.
(cycles shotgun)

536
00:30:49,643 --> 00:30:52,578
(keyboard tapping)

537
00:30:52,646 --> 00:30:54,080
(sighs)
(taps key)

538
00:30:54,147 --> 00:30:56,482
There we go.
thanksgiving afternoon.

539
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:58,818
All right.
where's this elephant?
(taps key)

540
00:30:58,885 --> 00:31:01,821
(taps key)

541
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,756
(taps key)
there.

542
00:31:03,824 --> 00:31:06,392
Right there.
(taps key)

543
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,227
(taps key)
i see it.

544
00:31:08,295 --> 00:31:11,230
(tapping keys)

545
00:31:11,298 --> 00:31:13,265
That--

546
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,234
That's sheriff hardy.

547
00:31:15,302 --> 00:31:17,703
(taps key)

548
00:31:17,771 --> 00:31:20,539
(taps key)
dumar is sheriff hardy?

549
00:31:20,607 --> 00:31:22,908
(door squeaks)

550
00:31:55,575 --> 00:31:57,977
(rattling)

551
00:32:01,081 --> 00:32:03,449
(hardy) jane, look at this.
huh.

552
00:32:09,523 --> 00:32:11,090
(metal clinks)

553
00:32:11,158 --> 00:32:14,760
(sweeps floor)

554
00:32:19,332 --> 00:32:20,566
(clank)

555
00:32:22,769 --> 00:32:24,270
(creaks)

556
00:32:38,151 --> 00:32:40,019
Answer the damn phone.
(van pelt) cbi.

557
00:32:40,087 --> 00:32:42,221
Van pelt, where's jane
and lisbon?
hey.

558
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:45,658
Following up a lead i gave 'em.
why? what's wrong?

559
00:32:56,636 --> 00:32:59,905
Oh.

560
00:33:05,812 --> 00:33:09,615
(breathing heavily)

561
00:33:15,689 --> 00:33:17,757
(click)

562
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,826
(breathing heavily)

563
00:33:40,614 --> 00:33:42,815
Maya! it's okay, maya.

564
00:33:42,883 --> 00:33:44,817
We're gonna get you
outta here.

565
00:33:44,885 --> 00:33:47,520
She's alive.

566
00:33:47,587 --> 00:33:49,889
What are you doing?

567
00:33:49,956 --> 00:33:52,691
You act smart, but really,
you're kinda dumb, huh?

568
00:33:52,759 --> 00:33:54,627
Don't move an inch.

569
00:33:54,694 --> 00:33:56,495
I-i-i don't understand.

570
00:33:56,563 --> 00:33:57,863
No. (laughs)

571
00:33:57,931 --> 00:34:00,166
You never really have.

572
00:34:00,233 --> 00:34:02,668
You recall a man by the name
of orval tanner?

573
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:04,403
Yeah.

574
00:34:04,471 --> 00:34:06,906
Red john's accomplice
in his first killing.

575
00:34:06,973 --> 00:34:09,408
He was caught.
died ten years ago in jail.

576
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:11,477
That's the man.

577
00:34:11,545 --> 00:34:13,879
I'm his son dumar.

578
00:34:13,947 --> 00:34:16,082
This is the family farm.

579
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:18,884
He was a good man,
good father.

580
00:34:18,952 --> 00:34:22,254
He wrote me every week until
the day he died, you know?

581
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:25,024
Taught me everything
i know.
and red john?

582
00:34:25,092 --> 00:34:26,592
Friend of my father's.

583
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,928
And a close friend of mine,
i'm proud to say.

584
00:34:28,995 --> 00:34:31,797
He doesn't have friends.
he has tools.

585
00:34:31,865 --> 00:34:33,532
He's using you.

586
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:39,038
Red john...
is not using me!

587
00:34:39,106 --> 00:34:41,540
He gave me maya.

588
00:34:41,608 --> 00:34:43,676
He gave me the woman
i love--

589
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:47,079
The woman
i'm gonna marry.
love? she's in a cage.

590
00:34:47,147 --> 00:34:49,148
Love's cruel.

591
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,083
At least she's safe.

592
00:34:51,151 --> 00:34:54,019
Not like out there...
with those degenerates.

593
00:34:57,524 --> 00:35:00,860
She'll grow to appreciate
the security i'm giving her.

594
00:35:00,927 --> 00:35:03,729
Isn't that right, honey?
huh?
(pounds door)

595
00:35:03,797 --> 00:35:07,233
She'll learn to love me
the way that i love her.

596
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:09,535
I wouldn't bet on that.

597
00:35:09,603 --> 00:35:12,071
I'm happy for the first time
in my life.

598
00:35:12,139 --> 00:35:15,141
And red john made that happen,
so don't you go telling me

599
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:19,078
He's no friend of mine.
and what did you have
to give him in exchange?

600
00:35:19,146 --> 00:35:21,514
He got emma... and you--

601
00:35:21,581 --> 00:35:23,749
He wanted you badly.

602
00:35:23,817 --> 00:35:26,285
He lured you in so sweetly.

603
00:35:26,353 --> 00:35:29,021
You just couldn't help
yourself, could you?

604
00:35:29,089 --> 00:35:32,324
Ha. if only that rosalind
woman hadn't popped up

605
00:35:32,392 --> 00:35:35,327
And spoiled things.
we were gonna get you here

606
00:35:35,395 --> 00:35:37,963
Nice and quiet,
so we could take our time.

607
00:35:38,031 --> 00:35:39,965
Now we'll have to find someplace
else to keep you both.

608
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:42,134
But that's life.
keep us from what?

609
00:35:42,202 --> 00:35:44,537
Oh...

610
00:35:44,604 --> 00:35:46,739
Well, you'll just have
to wait and see.

611
00:35:46,807 --> 00:35:48,140
Hmm?

612
00:35:48,208 --> 00:35:51,644
It's going to be
so... much... fun.

613
00:35:51,711 --> 00:35:53,913
Oh... (laughs)

614
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,282
(floor creaks)
(lisbon) hardy,
put the gun down.

615
00:35:56,349 --> 00:35:59,018
Put it down slowly.

616
00:35:59,086 --> 00:36:00,853
Crap.

617
00:36:00,921 --> 00:36:02,254
Listen, he--
now!

618
00:36:02,322 --> 00:36:03,956
He... (groans)

619
00:36:04,024 --> 00:36:05,024
(exhales sharply)

620
00:36:05,092 --> 00:36:06,625
(clatters)

621
00:36:06,693 --> 00:36:09,628
Put your hands
behind your head.
well, you fooled us, huh?

622
00:36:09,696 --> 00:36:12,665
Bravo. you never did
go see that judge.
damn it, lisbon.

623
00:36:12,732 --> 00:36:15,634
You were supposed to wait
until red john showed up.
i couldn't take the chance.

624
00:36:15,702 --> 00:36:18,771
Red john's long gone, anyway.
and you faked
the warrant argument...

625
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,773
Turn around, sir.
to lure me
into the open. slick.

626
00:36:20,841 --> 00:36:23,442
How did you know it was me?
don't move.

627
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,978
Rosalind mentioned
that dumar was a heavy smoker

628
00:36:26,046 --> 00:36:28,147
Who was trying to quit.
and you--you chew

629
00:36:28,215 --> 00:36:30,182
On those nicotine gums
all day long.

630
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,485
And it was you
that staged the break-in

631
00:36:32,552 --> 00:36:37,123
At the plaskett house
so you could plant the camera.

632
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,224
(spits)

633
00:36:40,861 --> 00:36:43,462
Bet you think you're
pretty cool right now, huh?

634
00:36:43,530 --> 00:36:44,797
Oh, yeah.

635
00:36:44,865 --> 00:36:46,966
Bingo.

636
00:36:47,033 --> 00:36:50,403
Tell you what, girly...
don't turn around.

637
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,405
You surrender now, and i'll
try to persuade red john

638
00:36:52,472 --> 00:36:55,174
To kill you quick and clean
instead of slow and nasty.

639
00:36:55,242 --> 00:36:57,643
Turn around and shut up!
(chuckles)

640
00:36:57,711 --> 00:37:00,980
(floor creaks above,
hatch slams shut)

641
00:37:01,047 --> 00:37:03,349
<i>(lisbon groans)</i>

642
00:37:06,987 --> 00:37:09,989
(siren wailing)

643
00:37:18,598 --> 00:37:20,266
(siren wailing)

644
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:23,702
<i>(both grunting)</i>

645
00:37:27,407 --> 00:37:29,308
Boss?

646
00:37:34,614 --> 00:37:37,283
This room's clear.

647
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,551
Clear!

648
00:37:38,618 --> 00:37:40,586
Rigsby!
(lisbon)
we're down here!

649
00:37:40,654 --> 00:37:42,621
There's a hatch
in the floor.

650
00:37:42,689 --> 00:37:45,224
(metal latch rattles,
wood creaks)

651
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:46,859
(panting)

652
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:49,395
You guys okay?

653
00:37:49,463 --> 00:37:50,896
(panting) we're fine.

654
00:37:50,964 --> 00:37:55,234
We've got maya.
call the paramedics.

655
00:38:03,210 --> 00:38:04,944
It's okay.

656
00:38:05,011 --> 00:38:07,480
Come here.

657
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:12,418
You're safe now, maya.

658
00:38:12,486 --> 00:38:15,187
(sniffles)
shh...

659
00:38:15,255 --> 00:38:16,388
It's okay.

660
00:38:16,456 --> 00:38:18,424
Shh.

661
00:38:18,492 --> 00:38:21,293
(crying softly)

662
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,782
He was here.

663
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:47,286
He was right here.

664
00:38:47,354 --> 00:38:49,922
We saved a girl's life,
jane.

665
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:52,625
We saved her life.
we have hardy, okay?

666
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:55,094
He's gonna tell us
what we need to know.

667
00:38:55,162 --> 00:38:57,163
Oh, you think so?

668
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,466
You should've waited.
we agreed on that.

669
00:39:00,534 --> 00:39:03,602
What if hardy had killed you
right here?

670
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:07,273
And then he would've led you
straight to red john.
you'd be dead.

671
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:09,408
But you would have
red john.

672
00:39:09,476 --> 00:39:12,078
I don't think you say
what you mean.

673
00:39:12,145 --> 00:39:14,880
I think
you'd choose life.

674
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:16,549
Well, you think wrong.

675
00:39:16,616 --> 00:39:19,151
No. no, you think wrong.

676
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:22,455
Can't you see there's people
who care about you,

677
00:39:22,522 --> 00:39:24,123
Who need you?

678
00:39:24,191 --> 00:39:26,292
You're being selfish
and childish,

679
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:29,295
And i want you to stop it.
i wish that i could,

680
00:39:29,362 --> 00:39:33,399
But, you know, some things
you just can't fix.

681
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:37,069
You needn't be angry.
it's just the way of the world.

682
00:39:41,842 --> 00:39:43,542
We still have hardy.

683
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:46,679
He's gonna talk.
he's gonna give us red john.

684
00:39:46,747 --> 00:39:48,714
Right. we have hardy.

685
00:39:48,782 --> 00:39:50,649
Yes.

686
00:39:50,717 --> 00:39:52,551
And we saved a life.

687
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:54,320
Yes, we did. we...

688
00:39:54,387 --> 00:39:56,355
We did. hurray for us.

689
00:39:56,423 --> 00:39:58,190
(footsteps approaching)

690
00:40:04,798 --> 00:40:08,134
(indistinct
