1
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:09,387
You clean up very nicely,
if you don't mind me saying so.

2
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:11,889
I don't mind you saying so.
Thanks.

3
00:00:14,144 --> 00:00:15,144
You look...

4
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:17,308
Pretty much the same
as you always look.

5
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:19,910
- Really?
- Yes.

6
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:21,687
- This is my date outfit.
- Really?

7
00:00:23,393 --> 00:00:26,110
Is this your first date?
I mean, since your wife died?

8
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,201
Do I seem out of practice?

9
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:31,989
My name's Gerard.
I'll be your server this evening.

10
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,242
- Would you like to hear our specials?
- Sorry, but I'm getting a message

11
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,953
from... your mother.

12
00:00:37,806 --> 00:00:38,806
Janet...

13
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:46,662
I'm sorry for your loss.

14
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,379
She's happy now.

15
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:52,708
And she wants you to know
that she sends her deepest love.

16
00:00:53,746 --> 00:00:54,746
And...

17
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:57,336
your uncle...

18
00:00:58,433 --> 00:00:59,433
says,

19
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:01,115
"roll tide."

20
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,128
Does that mean anything to you.
Roll tide?

21
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,219
My mother's brother Edward.

22
00:01:07,344 --> 00:01:09,860
He died five years ago.
He was a tight end at Alabama

23
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,083
in the '60s.

24
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:16,367
They're called the Crimson tide.
That's their rallying cry, "roll tide."

25
00:01:18,634 --> 00:01:21,863
I'd like to have the soup du jour
and the lamb, medium,

26
00:01:22,226 --> 00:01:23,776
and the arugula salad

27
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,484
and the fish for the lady.
Thank you.

28
00:01:27,866 --> 00:01:29,666
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

29
00:01:36,427 --> 00:01:37,221
What?

30
00:01:37,953 --> 00:01:38,973
Come on.

31
00:01:39,924 --> 00:01:42,275
You're so ferocious
in your lack of faith.

32
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:45,966
Is it so hard to imagine
that I'm not putting on an act?

33
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:48,099
That I really am what I say I am?

34
00:01:48,966 --> 00:01:50,818
His mother sent a message.
I'm meant to help.

35
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:52,036
That's all.

36
00:01:53,291 --> 00:01:54,905
It happens to me all the time.

37
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:00,698
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,030
Roll tide.

39
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:16,147
Bad guys just keep on coming, huh?

40
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,244
I hate the Internet.

41
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,410
If you like, I can deal.

42
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:22,308
- You go.
- No, it's okay.

43
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:26,470
It's just a web alert for when a name
we're interested in pops up.

44
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:38,450
What is it?

45
00:02:47,179 --> 00:02:48,529
This is not good.

46
00:02:49,787 --> 00:02:50,586
Relax,

47
00:02:51,044 --> 00:02:52,394
It's just a hoax.

48
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,389
It's staged, almost certainly.

49
00:03:04,765 --> 00:03:05,765
My God.

50
00:03:14,829 --> 00:03:15,989
I didn't put... no.

51
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:17,279
- Yes.
- No.

52
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,021
You went to jail, really?

53
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:22,409
- I did. What's so hard to believe?
- For how long?

54
00:03:22,739 --> 00:03:24,745
Two days
and two very luxurious nights.

55
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,581
And how'd you get out?

56
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,833
I just escaped.

57
00:03:29,677 --> 00:03:31,377
I don't believe you for one second.


58
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,546
It wasn't that difficult.
It's all timing.

59
00:03:35,538 --> 00:03:36,756
I'm not kidding.

60
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,318
Excuse me.
I have to go to the bathroom.

61
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:47,589
Thank you.

62
00:04:48,076 --> 00:04:49,226
I'm so sorry.

63
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,208
It's work.

64
00:04:53,595 --> 00:04:55,252
Jane, you need to come

65
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,087
to the office right now.

66
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,640
JJ Team

67
00:05:09,101 --> 00:05:11,435
2x23
~ Red Sky in the Morning ~

68
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,278
It was posted
on the Internet an hour ago

69
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,650
on a popular notice board.
There's a message that goes with it.

70
00:05:45,459 --> 00:05:47,221
"I am becoming
what I was meant to be.

71
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,515
"Your children's children
will worship me."

72
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,642
We don't know
where the video was made.

73
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,435
There appears to be an '08 Silverado

74
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:56,325
parked outside the house,
so it's gotta be at least that recent.

75
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,270
Has red john made videos
or issued statements like this before?

76
00:06:00,395 --> 00:06:01,860
- No.
- Thank you.

77
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,405
Excuse me.
Sorry to interrupt.

78
00:06:05,743 --> 00:06:07,793
Hi, Kristina.
Good to see you.

79
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,649
That poor girl.

80
00:06:12,868 --> 00:06:16,417
For what it's worth, I'm getting a sense
that she died very recently.

81
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,208
Her body
will be discovered very soon.

82
00:06:19,924 --> 00:06:21,274
She's near water.

83
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:26,135
Does this feel like Red John to you?

84
00:06:26,882 --> 00:06:28,658
I'm not getting a read on that.

85
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:31,746
The whole Internet aspect
is interesting, though, isn't it?

86
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:33,129
Why put it up there?

87
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,513
This clip's had over a million viewers.
A desire for fame?

88
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:40,733
Patrick, you're being very quiet.
What are you thinking?

89
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:43,006
I'd have to see the crime scene.

90
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,571
CHP just reported a homicide
in the bay area.

91
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:48,407
Smiley face on the wall.
College student named Marley Sparrow.

92
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:51,285
Roommate found her,
called it in about a half-hour ago.

93
00:06:51,635 --> 00:06:53,235
Let's get ready to go.

94
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:55,841
Bay area?

95
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:58,834
Yes. That is close to water.
That's uncanny.

96
00:06:59,056 --> 00:07:00,834
Come on.
That's pretty good.

97
00:07:01,548 --> 00:07:04,085
I am feeling a strong connection
to this case somehow.

98
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,841
Can we have a word, please?

99
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:08,899
Excuse us.

100
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:14,494
She's gonna ask
if she can come along with us.

101
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:17,463
Now obviously, that's your call.
But I hope that you refuse,

102
00:07:17,756 --> 00:07:19,104
'cause I won't work with her.

103
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:20,355
I will quit.

104
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,359
What's your objection?
If she can help us, why not?

105
00:07:23,628 --> 00:07:25,736
Nothing she says
is more than clever guesswork.

106
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:29,281
So she has essentially
the same skills as you,

107
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:31,433
without all the drama.

108
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:34,141
What's the deal?

109
00:07:35,828 --> 00:07:37,177
Red John is mine.

110
00:07:41,337 --> 00:07:42,211
I hear you.

111
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:45,005
Sorry to interrupt.

112
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:46,567
Please.

113
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:52,116
I was going to offer my services,

114
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:55,175
but I get the sense Mr. Jane is
telling you that he won't work with me.

115
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,352
The last thing I want to do

116
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,278
is upset this investigation,

117
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,232
but if I have any more feelings
about the case, could I call you?

118
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,897
Of course, Kristina.

119
00:08:05,311 --> 00:08:07,069
Always be glad
to hear your thoughts.

120
00:08:07,585 --> 00:08:08,695
Have a good night.

121
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:18,372
- Listen...
- I completely understand.

122
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,890
No hard feelings.

123
00:08:23,607 --> 00:08:25,529
That was an unusual date, though?

124
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:29,794
I'll see you soon, I hope.

125
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,265
- Would you...
- Yes, sure.

126
00:08:56,739 --> 00:08:58,245
Guys, give me a minute, please.

127
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:01,899
Thank you.

128
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:22,172
Hey, Marley.
We'll get this sorted out for you.

129
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:50,045
Long time.

130
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,591
So qué pasa, dude?

131
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:55,010
My people need to do their thing.

132
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:56,746
I won't be long.

133
00:10:05,592 --> 00:10:07,866
You hoovering up the, ol'psychic

134
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,274
ectoplasm?

135
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:14,158
Yeah, that's exactly what I'm doing.

136
00:10:15,325 --> 00:10:17,575
We have a schedule to keep,
amigo. Ticktock.

137
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:20,661
Sooner you're done fooling around,
sooner my people can find

138
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:21,970
actual clues.

139
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:23,909
She's from Iowa.

140
00:10:25,632 --> 00:10:28,502
She played the guitar.
She liked dark chocolate,

141
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,671
sudoku

142
00:10:29,886 --> 00:10:31,152
and snowboarding.

143
00:10:32,136 --> 00:10:33,632
Shy, but strong.

144
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:35,551
Honorable, modest.

145
00:10:36,237 --> 00:10:37,597
Didn't drink or smoke.

146
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,796
Parents died
when she was very young.

147
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:43,892
And, she wanted to go
into family law and help foster kids

148
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,274
like herself.
Or become a singer.

149
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,814
She hadn't made up her mind yet.

150
00:10:49,014 --> 00:10:51,692
Yeah, that's great, dude.
But where's Red John?

151
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,717
This wasn't Red John.

152
00:10:53,945 --> 00:10:54,820
So you say.

153
00:10:57,699 --> 00:10:58,700
So I say.

154
00:11:05,591 --> 00:11:08,191
Make sure you have your people
send those papers and journals

155
00:11:08,316 --> 00:11:09,751
to the CBI office.

156
00:11:10,096 --> 00:11:11,044
Will do.

157
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:12,845
Thank you.

158
00:11:31,142 --> 00:11:32,608
Marley was the best.

159
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:34,192
The best person.

160
00:11:34,531 --> 00:11:35,835
A beautiful soul.

161
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,196
Ruth, you found her body, yes?

162
00:11:39,441 --> 00:11:40,449
When you entered,

163
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,160
did you notice anything unusual
before you found the body?

164
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:45,954
- Something missing or out of place?
- No, I don't think so.

165
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,088
- How long had you been gone?
- Two days, snowboarding.

166
00:11:49,597 --> 00:11:50,900
Marley was supposed to come,

167
00:11:51,025 --> 00:11:54,504
but then her boyfriend was coming over
to see her, so she stayed.

168
00:11:54,752 --> 00:11:55,589
His name?

169
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:56,631
Grady Shipp.

170
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,842
He's a policeman in San Francisco.

171
00:12:00,306 --> 00:12:02,238
They've been dating for, like...

172
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,437
a month.

173
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:05,390
Okay. What was he like?
Nice guy?

174
00:12:05,635 --> 00:12:07,453
Marley really liked him a lot.

175
00:12:07,578 --> 00:12:09,644
Said he was super nice.
But I don't know.

176
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,438
We never actually met him.

177
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,768
She'd go to his place, mostly.

178
00:12:15,039 --> 00:12:16,469
And when he came by here,

179
00:12:16,594 --> 00:12:18,070
he'd wait for her in his car.

180
00:12:18,238 --> 00:12:19,238
Weird?

181
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,284
I think Marley was a bit embarrassed

182
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:23,575
for hooking up

183
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,202
with a cop, you know?

184
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,120
So she kept him on the down low.

185
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,246
Embarrassed?

186
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:30,334
Marley was cool.

187
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:34,913
And cops are sort of nerds with guns,
aren't they?

188
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:37,089
Hello?

189
00:12:38,064 --> 00:12:38,924
No offense.

190
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:43,261
Sorry.

191
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,489
Marley Sparrow?

192
00:12:44,614 --> 00:12:47,265
Yes, I was her academic advisor
for two semesters.

193
00:12:48,299 --> 00:12:49,560
Nice enough girl,

194
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,854
but not as clever
as she likes to think she is.

195
00:12:53,096 --> 00:12:54,809
But none of 'em are, are they?

196
00:12:54,934 --> 00:12:57,150
Did you notice any changes
in her behavior recently?

197
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,623
No. But nor do I pay
close attention.

198
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,363
They're all empty vessels
to be filled

199
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:02,781
with knowledge.
Here is

200
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,700
a horrible coincidence.

201
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:08,578
Last semester, I taught
a criminology elective.

202
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:10,480
Murder, myth and marketing...

203
00:13:10,605 --> 00:13:12,749
The serial killer as commodity.

204
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:15,308
Red John

205
00:13:15,677 --> 00:13:18,547
was actually mentioned in our class
discussions. Isn't that eerie?

206
00:13:19,436 --> 00:13:21,007
Who mentioned him?
What'd they say?

207
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,218
Damned if I know.
It was eight or nine months ago.

208
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:24,886
Do you have a student list?

209
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,196
You know, I do.

210
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:28,056
I do. Somewhere.

211
00:13:31,196 --> 00:13:33,270
We would love to get a look
at that list.

212
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,496
No Grady Shipp
with any San Fran police agency.

213
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:42,863
No Grady Shipp, period.

214
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:45,384
There was a Grady Shipp once.
He ate his neighbors

215
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:47,242
in little rock back in the '90s.

216
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,380
He was lethally injected
in Arkansas in '02.

217
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:52,381
So Marley's boyfriend
doesn't want anybody to see his face,

218
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:54,124
and he named himself
after a cannibal.

219
00:13:54,356 --> 00:13:57,043
- That's two strikes against him.
- We don't have a name or other.

220
00:13:57,318 --> 00:13:59,504
The roommate,
said that he never got out of his car.

221
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,435
Maybe we can get a make
and model from her.

222
00:14:04,168 --> 00:14:05,200
In 1989,

223
00:14:05,325 --> 00:14:08,118
he did a 6-month spell
in the same wing at Lompoc

224
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:09,347
as Orval Tanner.

225
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,016
- Tanner?
- Red John's friend.

226
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,351
You have the entire Lompoc
prison registry

227
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,769
in your head?

228
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,485
Only the relevant sections.

229
00:14:16,748 --> 00:14:18,440
What does it mean? Is it a joke?

230
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,734
- Marley's boyfriend is Red John.
- Senseless.

231
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,281
In the hunt for this beast
known as "Red John".

232
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,499
Well, he...
he's not a beast, Jackie.

233
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:31,963
He's a human being.

234
00:14:32,088 --> 00:14:33,808
Now he has done terrible things,

235
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:36,582
but he is still capable of
redemption...

236
00:14:37,148 --> 00:14:38,335
Like all of us.

237
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:42,881
Red John...

238
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:47,026
if you're listening to us now,

239
00:14:47,151 --> 00:14:50,179
I urge you to reach out
and get help.

240
00:14:50,898 --> 00:14:52,224
You can change.

241
00:15:08,012 --> 00:15:09,707
What the hell are you thinking?

242
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,910
Don't you understand
who you're dealing with?

243
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:14,120
- I do understand, yes.
- No, you don't.

244
00:15:14,288 --> 00:15:16,206
Clearly, you don't understand.

245
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,666
I asked miss Frye here

246
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,043
so that I could fully express
my deep dismay.

247
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:22,712
- I was speaking from the heart.
- That may be,

248
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,434
but you were also hustling for business.
And that's okay,

249
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,425
but you
present me now with a problem.

250
00:15:28,665 --> 00:15:31,179
We don't have any obligation
to protect you, but...

251
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,139
I wasn't asking.
Completely unnecessary.

252
00:15:33,621 --> 00:15:35,892
- Red John is not coming after me.
- Are you blind?

253
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:38,356
You've done exactly what I did.

254
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:41,489
I went on television and talked
about him as though I knew him,

255
00:15:41,614 --> 00:15:43,108
and he killed my wife and child.

256
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,444
Patrick, he was punishing you
because you lied about him.

257
00:15:47,116 --> 00:15:48,405
I was telling the truth.

258
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:50,198
He won't take offense with me.

259
00:15:50,518 --> 00:15:54,035
He might even listen to what I said.
In fact, I believe he will.

260
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:57,747
People do change, Patrick.
It's possible.

261
00:15:59,981 --> 00:16:02,127
Agent Hightower, I'm truly sorry

262
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,603
for dismaying you.

263
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,858
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have some other appointments.

264
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:15,293
She needs 24-hour protection...

265
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:17,183
The best that you can provide.

266
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:21,087
The Sac P.D. Special protection unit
will provide security,

267
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,754
the CBI will be on the inside,
bodyguarding miss Frye.

268
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:25,466
Jane and I will take
the first shift.

269
00:16:25,591 --> 00:16:27,789
The next 24-hour rotation
will be split among us,

270
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:29,515
alternating with the Sparrow case.

271
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,470
We're gonna have
to stop protecting her.

272
00:16:31,595 --> 00:16:33,514
That's when he'll go for her.
He'll just wait.

273
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:35,285
Van pelt, what do you got?

274
00:16:35,453 --> 00:16:37,621
We're looking for Grady Shipp?
Marley's address book.

275
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:40,999
Different writing.
Maybe Grady Shipp himself.

276
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:42,834
- Can I?
- Keep digging.

277
00:16:43,109 --> 00:16:45,337
- Take Cho with you. Check it out.
- Yeah, you got it.

278
00:17:45,673 --> 00:17:46,673
Blood.

279
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:51,987
Pig's blood, maybe.

280
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:53,738
For practice?

281
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:31,385
I'll call it in.

282
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:39,868
What is it?

283
00:18:40,842 --> 00:18:41,953
A lens cap.

284
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,221
Interesting.

285
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:45,514
Practicing the Red John symbol,

286
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,756
and not just watching us pursue him,

287
00:18:47,881 --> 00:18:49,502
but filming the pursuit.

288
00:18:50,318 --> 00:18:51,346
What does it mean?

289
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:55,008
It means Marley Sparrow's killer
loves cameras. He's a voyeur...

290
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,718
A fanboy, a slasher movie geek.

291
00:18:57,686 --> 00:18:58,538
Great.

292
00:18:58,663 --> 00:19:00,127
But where does that take us now?

293
00:19:00,252 --> 00:19:01,347
Like in a car?

294
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:05,060
- Try the campus film club.
- All right.

295
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,670
Nice place?

296
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,022
Tasteful.

297
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:13,276
It looks like we're about to pay
too much money to get our legs waxed.

298
00:19:15,896 --> 00:19:17,530
Would you like something to eat?

299
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:18,823
Sure, thanks.

300
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:20,220
I'm good.

301
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:27,156
On reflection, I'm truly sorry
for the situation I put you in.

302
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:29,166
I hadn't thought through
your involvement.

303
00:19:29,806 --> 00:19:32,045
I'll eat some lunch.
Just please don't make a fuss.

304
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:35,847
Miss Ketchum?

305
00:19:37,156 --> 00:19:38,156
Policemen.

306
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:41,299
I knew I'd forgotten something...

307
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:44,966
There it is.

308
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:47,644
- I thought for sure I'd sent that.
- Sent what?

309
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,479
The class list of the students

310
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:51,523
in my criminology class.

311
00:19:52,085 --> 00:19:55,360
- Your colleague had asked for it.
- You're chair of the film club also?

312
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,958
I have that honor.

313
00:19:57,597 --> 00:20:00,573
You know what? I have
the film club register here as well.

314
00:20:03,272 --> 00:20:05,036
Yes. Would you like to see it?

315
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:07,189
Yes, that would be good.

316
00:20:07,547 --> 00:20:08,547
Okay.

317
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:11,381
Here you go.

318
00:20:15,069 --> 00:20:16,798
Where were you Tuesday night?

319
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:20,927
Thrilling!

320
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:23,346
- Am I a suspect?
- Are you?

321
00:20:24,246 --> 00:20:25,246
Well...

322
00:20:25,577 --> 00:20:28,351
I'd like to think I can still summon
that kind of passion.

323
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,811
So where were you?

324
00:20:30,742 --> 00:20:32,125
Home. Alone.

325
00:20:33,001 --> 00:20:34,899
Reading a murder mystery, actually.

326
00:20:35,336 --> 00:20:37,944
Now there's only one name
on both lists. Wesley Blankfein.

327
00:20:38,874 --> 00:20:40,196
You just made a face.

328
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,822
Well, he is a sweet boy.

329
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:45,764
Rather a good actor, actually.

330
00:20:46,457 --> 00:20:47,870
But, strange.

331
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,455
Strange? How?

332
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,380
I can't really put my finger on it.

333
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:53,517
It's a look in his eyes.

334
00:20:54,296 --> 00:20:55,545
Yep, that's him.

335
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,671
I remember when he moved in.

336
00:20:57,796 --> 00:21:00,875
I mentioned to him he was a little older
than most of our students,

337
00:21:01,057 --> 00:21:03,692
and he said he needed to escape
from his mother.

338
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,057
Which I thought was an odd response.

339
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:12,190
- And when did you last see him?
- Three weeks ago, maybe.

340
00:21:12,315 --> 00:21:14,315
I figured he had a girlfriend.

341
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:16,691
- Nothing here!
- Hey Dylan.

342
00:21:17,863 --> 00:21:19,027
Quick question.

343
00:21:19,328 --> 00:21:21,613
You said Marley's boyfriend
waited in a car?

344
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:26,061
- Do you recall what type of car?
- It was black, I think.

345
00:21:27,001 --> 00:21:29,662
- I'm bad with cars.
- It was a black SVU.

346
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:33,082
- What car did Blankfein drive?
- He didn't have a car.

347
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:40,697
Try locating Blankfein's mother.
Maybe she knows where he is.

348
00:21:41,346 --> 00:21:42,383
Let me know.

349
00:21:43,504 --> 00:21:46,216
Wesley Blankfein's in the wind.
He might be good for this.

350
00:21:46,923 --> 00:21:48,187
I don't think so.

351
00:21:48,312 --> 00:21:51,100
Marley made contact with me.
The name "Blankfein" doesn't resonate.

352
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:53,144
He made contact with you?

353
00:21:54,428 --> 00:21:55,428
Of course.

354
00:21:56,342 --> 00:21:59,984
I think we might have had enough
of your crime-fighting skills, Kristina.

355
00:22:00,484 --> 00:22:03,586
Might be best to stick
to the crystal therapy and the...

356
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:05,453
foot massages?

357
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,325
- Reflexology.
- Right.

358
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,493
Reflexology.

359
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:14,971
- This is Lisbon.
- 

360
00:22:15,538 --> 00:22:17,604
We got a case here in Lake Tahoe.

361
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,838
Looks like your boy Red John.

362
00:22:20,206 --> 00:22:22,583
The victim's name is
Jacqueline Sandoval.

363
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,818
You wanna come take a look?

364
00:22:30,495 --> 00:22:32,205
You can smile your arrogant smile

365
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,335
and act like you know everything
about everything, but you don't.

366
00:22:35,749 --> 00:22:38,315
There are whole worlds
you can't even begin to understand.

367
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,326
Synchronized swimming is the only world
that springs to mind.

368
00:22:41,451 --> 00:22:43,728
But I'm sure you're right.
There may be many others.

369
00:22:44,997 --> 00:22:46,397
What's the matter?

370
00:22:47,297 --> 00:22:49,701
Red John killed the woman
who interviewed you.

371
00:22:51,974 --> 00:22:53,024
Oh, my god.

372
00:22:57,255 --> 00:22:58,255
My God.

373
00:23:45,665 --> 00:23:47,175
It's Red John, all right.

374
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:50,303
I'll reach out to the feds,
make sure they keep us in the loop.

375
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:52,318
We must go back
to Kristina Frye's place.

376
00:23:52,443 --> 00:23:54,863
There are cops all around her house.
Van Pelt is with her,

377
00:23:54,988 --> 00:23:57,884
and there's other CBI agents
on their way. She's safe.

378
00:23:58,614 --> 00:24:00,510
I am confident
Red John won't go there.

379
00:24:00,635 --> 00:24:03,858
- That is exactly why he might.
- If he does, we'll get him.

380
00:24:04,299 --> 00:24:07,236
You wanna hang out at Kristina's
house, waiting for Red John to show up?

381
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:10,156
Let's go back to the office,
work the Marley Sparrow case.

382
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:12,367
There's nothing useful
that I can do there.

383
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:15,286
This Blankfein character,
he looks good for it, right?

384
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,368
Fine. Go and wait for Red John.

385
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,615
It's not a good idea, though.

386
00:24:20,943 --> 00:24:23,795
We're in Nevada. You can't just
walk off and leave me here.

387
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,783
Wesley Blankfein's mother
is Myra Hauser-Blankfein.

388
00:24:30,908 --> 00:24:32,335
Address in Franklin Heights.

389
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,496
She owns a black SUV
like Grady Shipp drives.

390
00:24:34,621 --> 00:24:36,771
- Good. Go check her out.
- Now?

391
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:38,048
It's a long drive.

392
00:24:38,173 --> 00:24:40,197
You leave now,
you'll be there by the morning.

393
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:02,675
Grace, thank you.

394
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:09,841
How you doing?

395
00:25:11,064 --> 00:25:12,348
I'm doing fine.

396
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:17,330
Red John certainly made his point.

397
00:25:18,178 --> 00:25:21,548
Quite possibly,
he'll leave things be now.

398
00:25:22,465 --> 00:25:23,715
I know he will.

399
00:25:24,463 --> 00:25:25,815
I have a clear vision of him.

400
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:28,526
He needs to create fear, that's all.

401
00:25:29,014 --> 00:25:30,987
He's done that now,
and he feels calm.

402
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,420
I'm perfectly safe.

403
00:25:32,545 --> 00:25:34,438
Will you just stop that nonsense?

404
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,315
You wanted to promote
your psychic business,

405
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,215
and you made a big mistake.

406
00:25:40,532 --> 00:25:43,291
- Now will you please just own it?
- Why are you here?

407
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:45,628
I am here
because I want to protect you.

408
00:25:45,753 --> 00:25:47,417
And how are you gonna protect me?

409
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,788
If he comes right now,
what are you gonna do,

410
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,883
- hypnotize him?
- What I need to do.

411
00:25:53,053 --> 00:25:55,553
If Red John wants to reach me,
he will.

412
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,907
I choose to believe
that he doesn't want to.

413
00:25:58,032 --> 00:26:00,282
- Now please, go away.
- I'm gone.

414
00:26:17,023 --> 00:26:18,409
You're wasting your time.

415
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,411
We're looking for Mrs. Blankfein
and her son.

416
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,824
Gone. And left the cats to starve.
It's not right.

417
00:26:23,949 --> 00:26:25,791
- Do you know where they went?
- No.

418
00:26:26,078 --> 00:26:27,838
Never leaves before. Never.

419
00:26:28,328 --> 00:26:29,998
Every day, 11:00,

420
00:26:30,123 --> 00:26:32,465
like a machine,
she's watching her tv shows.

421
00:26:32,712 --> 00:26:34,820
Three days now I hear nothing.

422
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,838
Quiet like the grave.

423
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:39,847
- Her son wesley? Have you seen him?
- Nope. Gone, too.

424
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:41,933
You know
Mrs. Blankfein might be dead?

425
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:43,618
Yes, it did.

426
00:26:44,555 --> 00:26:47,300
But there'd be a smell,
wouldn't there, if she was dead?

427
00:26:50,625 --> 00:26:51,984
Step back inside please.

428
00:27:07,631 --> 00:27:08,793
Bedroom's clear.

429
00:27:17,557 --> 00:27:18,557
Jeez.

430
00:27:20,052 --> 00:27:21,052
"G.S."

431
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,674
- Grady Shipp.
- Bingo.

432
00:27:25,811 --> 00:27:27,690
Inside the mind of Wesley Blankfein.

433
00:27:27,992 --> 00:27:29,526
Aka Grady Shipp.

434
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:31,458
Not pretty.

435
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:34,550
What it looks like, he's obsessed
with Marley, so he builds a shrine,

436
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,862
fakes up all these photos
of them together,

437
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,157
tries to turn the fantasy into reality,
and posing as Grady Shipp,

438
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,056
he asks her out, and she says yes.

439
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:44,567
Big mistake.
Fantasy and reality collide,

440
00:27:44,974 --> 00:27:46,969
- and she dies.
- Sounds about right.

441
00:27:47,094 --> 00:27:49,464
Where the hell is he?
Where's his mom?

442
00:27:49,752 --> 00:27:52,295
You find anything useful
in the apartment? No computer?

443
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:53,637
No. A lot of cats.

444
00:27:53,762 --> 00:27:56,382
The pictures of Marley were taken
at different times and places.

445
00:27:56,793 --> 00:27:59,093
The pictures of Wesley
were taken in the same place.

446
00:27:59,441 --> 00:28:00,711
Nowhere we've been.

447
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:03,180
- Maybe it's a safe house.
- Nothing to say where it is.

448
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:06,684
You take a look,
if you see anything useful?

449
00:28:08,435 --> 00:28:09,228
Sure.

450
00:28:09,955 --> 00:28:11,055
If you like.

451
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:34,248
And...

452
00:28:35,137 --> 00:28:37,339
There's a photo of Wesley
with a sign in the distance.

453
00:28:37,464 --> 00:28:39,492
A yellow "KC" backward on a pole.

454
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,218
His shadow is pointing right to it.

455
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,516
Yeah. It's way small
back there, but I see it.

456
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,276
That's the logo for Kenny's Chili.

457
00:28:50,401 --> 00:28:52,239
Southern California fast food chain.

458
00:28:52,364 --> 00:28:54,980
- There's about 50 or so outlets.
- You memorize trademarks?

459
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,413
With Wesley's long shadow
and the golden light,

460
00:28:57,538 --> 00:28:58,944
that would say afternoon.

461
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,162
And sun is in the west,
so that puts Kenny's

462
00:29:02,662 --> 00:29:06,327
due east of this location,
about a block and a half, I'd say.

463
00:29:07,468 --> 00:29:08,287
He's right.

464
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,509
50 or so outlets?

465
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,792
Hardware store
and a liquor store next to it.

466
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,086
- That should narrow it down.
- I'll get on it.

467
00:29:17,462 --> 00:29:18,255
Thank you.

468
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:22,593
You should make that call.

469
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,095
What call?

470
00:29:24,451 --> 00:29:26,851
Right.
Like I'm not a detective, too?

471
00:29:42,545 --> 00:29:43,864
Hey, Jane. It's Grace.

472
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,522
Kristina's taking a nap.
I can get her for you if you like.

473
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:49,203
I'd appreciate that, Grace.
Thank you.

474
00:29:51,592 --> 00:29:52,592
Kristina?

475
00:29:56,086 --> 00:29:57,296
It's Jane for you.

476
00:30:00,476 --> 00:30:01,587
Open the door.

477
00:30:19,173 --> 00:30:20,818
How did Kristina
get past the guards?

478
00:30:20,986 --> 00:30:23,810
We don't know. But she also packed
a bag, she took her passport

479
00:30:23,935 --> 00:30:26,651
and her credit cards, so we can
assume she wasn't abducted.

480
00:30:26,776 --> 00:30:30,536
You can't assume. Red john could've
gotten in and taken her.

481
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,914
Maybe. The likelihood that she's panic
and ran somewhere to hide.

482
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:36,208
Or maybe he lured her out somehow.

483
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,994
We'll check the phone records.

484
00:30:38,601 --> 00:30:41,622
Let's start contacting her relatives
and friends. She's out there.

485
00:30:41,747 --> 00:30:43,257
Forgive me, but belay that order.

486
00:30:44,635 --> 00:30:46,676
The search for Kristina Frye
will be conducted

487
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,846
- by the missing persons unit.
- What?

488
00:30:49,737 --> 00:30:51,335
They're the best at what they do.

489
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,167
They will find her
if she can be found.

490
00:30:54,292 --> 00:30:57,229
And, Van Pelt, snap out of it.
Wasn't your fault.

491
00:30:57,711 --> 00:30:59,106
- Yes, ma'am,
- Move on.

492
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,652
Where are we
on the Marley Sparrow case?

493
00:31:04,301 --> 00:31:07,448
We have a suspect at large
by the name of Wesley Blankfein.

494
00:31:08,152 --> 00:31:10,910
He's been obsessed with both
Red John and Marley Sparrow.

495
00:31:11,275 --> 00:31:13,184
He seems to have created
an alter ego

496
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,031
by the name of Grady Shipp.

497
00:31:15,156 --> 00:31:17,332
It's after a killer
with Red John connections.

498
00:31:17,457 --> 00:31:18,399
Any leads?

499
00:31:18,524 --> 00:31:20,666
Off photos he took,
we've ID'd 6 possible locations

500
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:22,630
for what we assume is
Blankfein's safe house.

501
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,673
It's much a long shot,
but it's all we have.

502
00:31:25,162 --> 00:31:25,966
Go to it.

503
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,926
Let's start divvying up
the locations.

504
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:31,096
Cho, you take riverside county.
Bring Rigsby with you.

505
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,682
Van Pelt and I will take
the san bernardino locations.

506
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:37,102
You stay here.
Take a break.

507
00:31:37,708 --> 00:31:39,897
- I don't need a break.
- I think you do.

508
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,895
I'd rather keep active.

509
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,984
You're too hyped up to be out
in the field.

510
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,821
- That's nonsense.
- I agree with Lisbon. Get some rest.

511
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,360
Some rest?

512
00:31:48,868 --> 00:31:51,686
Just lie down
and catch up on some z's.

513
00:31:52,021 --> 00:31:53,866
Kick back with a good book.
Rest?

514
00:31:55,062 --> 00:31:56,956
- I'm fine.
- Debatable.

515
00:31:57,934 --> 00:32:00,626
Do you want me to ask
the psych counselor for an evaluation?

516
00:33:36,901 --> 00:33:38,599
Leave a message.
I'll call you back.

517
00:33:38,973 --> 00:33:41,317
Lisbon, it's Jane. I found it.

518
00:33:41,442 --> 00:33:43,520
It's 52 North Esperanza.

519
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:46,357
Hotel Del Corona in Salinger Mill.

520
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:48,299
I am gonna...

521
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,894
I'm gonna wait for you
at Kenny's, okay?

522
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:59,078
Give me a call
when you get this message. Thank you.

523
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,576
Welcome, Detective.

524
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:24,580
I'm Grady Shipp.

525
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:27,743
So good of you to come visit me.

526
00:35:29,038 --> 00:35:30,488
You're a lucky man.

527
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:33,005
Very lucky.

528
00:35:34,297 --> 00:35:35,297
Tonight...

529
00:35:36,151 --> 00:35:38,050
You will have the dying honor...

530
00:35:40,731 --> 00:35:42,281
Can we do that again?

531
00:35:44,636 --> 00:35:45,636
Tonight...

532
00:35:47,257 --> 00:35:49,229
You will have the honor of dying

533
00:35:50,471 --> 00:35:51,786
as a sacrifice

534
00:35:51,911 --> 00:35:53,192
to the holy master.

535
00:35:57,856 --> 00:35:58,920
Behold...

536
00:35:59,969 --> 00:36:01,200
The blood sacrament

537
00:36:02,148 --> 00:36:03,348
of the master.

538
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:06,288
Stop.

539
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,375
You wanna try that again?

540
00:36:10,382 --> 00:36:12,947
Just try it again.
Say it like you mean it.

541
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:14,296
Where's the passion gone?

542
00:36:15,213 --> 00:36:17,589
Behold the blood sacrament
of the master.

543
00:36:17,714 --> 00:36:19,927
No. I'm not...
I'm not buying it. Come on.

544
00:36:21,188 --> 00:36:23,210
Just stop of a second and think...

545
00:36:23,335 --> 00:36:26,099
Think about what you're doing,
and we'll start again from the top?

546
00:36:29,611 --> 00:36:32,106
I know what's going on.
They've got your mother, don't they?

547
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:35,275
How'd you know?

548
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,487
They're forcing you to play a part
in their sick little movie.

549
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:43,617
You're playing the part
of grady shipp, right?

550
00:36:45,186 --> 00:36:47,176
It's okay. It's okay.

551
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,177
We need to talk.

552
00:36:55,393 --> 00:36:58,356
Thank you very much
for totally ruining

553
00:36:58,722 --> 00:37:00,375
a freaking brilliant scene,

554
00:37:00,897 --> 00:37:01,897
you jerk.

555
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:03,720
Hush, Dyl.

556
00:37:06,374 --> 00:37:07,558
How did you know?

557
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:10,435
You were the only people
that mentioned Grady Shipp.

558
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,354
He was your creation.

559
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,148
And it was you that killed Marley,

560
00:37:14,316 --> 00:37:15,566
wasn't it, Dylan?

561
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:20,217
Wesley couldn't hurt a fly.

562
00:37:21,408 --> 00:37:23,907
It was a truly sick individual
that did that.

563
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,452
It was me, actually.

564
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:30,767
Dyl's much better with the camera,

565
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,207
and Marley...

566
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:34,835
Deserved what she got,

567
00:37:35,514 --> 00:37:36,913
pious little bitch.

568
00:37:38,535 --> 00:37:41,633
Keep the camera running.
This is all good stuff.

569
00:37:42,664 --> 00:37:45,262
You wouldn't know good stuff
if it smacked you in the face.

570
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,347
This is just a corny slasher movie.

571
00:37:48,046 --> 00:37:50,484
But real, dude.
Real blood.

572
00:37:51,013 --> 00:37:51,852
Real guts.

573
00:37:52,925 --> 00:37:55,230
Yours. Wesley, let's,
wrap this scene up now.

574
00:37:55,735 --> 00:37:58,300
Gonna pick it up right at the end...
"behold the blood," etc...

575
00:37:58,425 --> 00:37:59,818
and then stab this sucker.

576
00:38:03,368 --> 00:38:04,615
I don't know.

577
00:38:06,094 --> 00:38:07,659
What are you... Not... No!

578
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,036
This man is dead.

579
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,132
The only question
is whether you and your mom

580
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:13,290
want to live
or you want to die like him.

581
00:38:13,697 --> 00:38:14,927
That's your choice here.

582
00:38:15,052 --> 00:38:16,792
These people are nuttier
than a fruitcake.

583
00:38:16,917 --> 00:38:20,047
They're gonna kill you regardless.
You don't have to do this.

584
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,798
We are not monsters, Wesley.

585
00:38:23,009 --> 00:38:24,134
We're artists.

586
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,197
We are making art.

587
00:38:29,224 --> 00:38:32,538
When the movie's done, of course you
and your mom are free to go,

588
00:38:32,663 --> 00:38:34,937
with our gratitude for your help.

589
00:38:35,403 --> 00:38:36,313
Stay calm.

590
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:40,201
"Behold the blood." Wesley.

591
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,408
I'm sorry.

592
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:52,788
- Behold...
- No, wesley.

593
00:38:53,224 --> 00:38:54,521
The blood sacrament...

594
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:56,625
- It's okay.
- Of the master!

595
00:39:23,685 --> 00:39:25,707
If there's one thing
I can't tolerate,

596
00:39:25,832 --> 00:39:27,948
it's cheap imitations of my work.

597
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:53,197
Do you know who I am?

598
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,974
"Tiger, tiger, burning bright...

599
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,001
"in the forests of the night,

600
00:40:23,348 --> 00:40:25,215
"what immortal hand or eye

601
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:27,884
"could frame thy fearful symmetry?"

602
00:40:52,639 --> 00:40:53,909
I almost forgot.

603
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:59,244
Kristina would want me
to send her love.

604
00:41:02,022 --> 00:41:04,784
She's very fond of you,
despite your differences.

605
00:41:07,955 --> 00:41:08,955
Roll tide.

606
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,880
You okay?

607
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:49,256
I'm fine.

608
00:41:50,623 --> 00:41:52,523
You're sure he said nothing?

609
00:41:53,108 --> 00:41:54,094
Nothing at all?

610
00:41:56,755 --> 00:41:57,755
Nothing.

611
00:42:25,647 --> 00:42:26,847
"Tiger, tiger,

612
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,655
"burning bright...

613
00:42:31,773 --> 00:42:33,723
"in the forests of the night,

614
00:42:35,777 --> 00:42:37,263
"what immortal hand or eye

615
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:39,712
"could frame thy fearful symmetry?"
