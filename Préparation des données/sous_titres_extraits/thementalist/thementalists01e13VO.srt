1
00:00:00,618 --> 00:00:03,113
<i>MENTALIST /'men-t3-list/ noun</i>

2
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,730
<i>Someone who uses mental
Acuity, hypnosis and/or suggestion.</i>

3
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:13,150
<i>A master manipulator of
Thoughts and behavior.</i>

4
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:34,350
Are you sure about this?
What if somebody sees us?

5
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:37,036
Relax, baby.
I got it all under control.

6
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:35,039
- What do we have here?
- The name's harry lashley,

7
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:37,194
a junior v.p. with the company.
He's the son-in-law

8
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,807
of the boss, a.p. caid.
The receptionist, miss duane,

9
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,933
over there, forget her phone.
Came back to get it,

10
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:44,172
- found him like this.
- She called security.

11
00:01:44,297 --> 00:01:45,747
Luckily I was working late.

12
00:01:45,872 --> 00:01:47,752
I called 9-1-1 as
soon as I got here.

13
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:51,075
I then opened up Mr. Caid's office
to check, but nothing was amiss.

14
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,915
I have an all-access pass.

15
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,360
Well, come on.

16
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:00,119
Only one thing was missing, but it's
the most valuable painting he owns.

17
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:03,956
A.p. Picked it up at an
auction a couple of months ago.

18
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,903
Paid a little over
$50 million for it.

19
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:08,815
Now you said that these doors
were, closed before you got here?

20
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,390
The office is always
locked up when a.p.'s not here.

21
00:02:11,515 --> 00:02:14,615
It's a strict rule that
a.p. Has when he's gone.

22
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,927
And Mr. Lashley... What
would he have been doing here?

23
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,630
No idea.
His office is two floors down.

24
00:02:19,755 --> 00:02:21,910
- He had no reason to be here.
- Maybe he was involved.

25
00:02:22,035 --> 00:02:23,694
If we're lucky, we'll
find the murder weapon.

26
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,603
This was obviously a
well-planned robbery.

27
00:02:25,771 --> 00:02:26,969
Why is that obvious?

28
00:02:27,094 --> 00:02:30,075
Well, nobody finds themselves in
a locked room full of old masters

29
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:32,359
in the middle of the
night by accident, do they?

30
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:36,531
So well-planned, but they weren't
expecting to meet any opposition.

31
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:39,283
Otherwise, Mr. Lashley
here would have been shot

32
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:41,881
or tasered or tied up and gagged.

33
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:46,705
But when they were surprised by
him, they simply hit him on the head,

34
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,918
Which suggests an
improvised weapon, yeah?

35
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,885
I'm listening.

36
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:54,336
Yes, something like...

37
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:05,514
I predict forensics will find
traces of harry lashley on this bust.

38
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:08,073
No offense, but

39
00:03:08,198 --> 00:03:10,005
I used to be police myself,

40
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:12,483
and that's not police work.
That's guessing.

41
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,996
- Carl, bag this for me.
- Yes, sir.

42
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,827
Frank. Is there a
good diner around here?

43
00:03:23,976 --> 00:03:27,748
Yeah. Garrity's, a couple
of blocks over on... Madison.

44
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,810
- Do they do good eggs?
- I guess.

45
00:03:29,935 --> 00:03:31,836
That's the test
of a good diner... Eggs.

46
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,923
You must have had a contentious
relationship with your father.

47
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:37,053
Excuse me? No.

48
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:41,053
Tell me... I can't tell with the
hair in her face and the sobbing,

49
00:03:41,325 --> 00:03:44,765
But, i imagine miss duane
is quite attractive, isn't she?

50
00:03:45,648 --> 00:03:48,445
I mean, receptionists are
often hired for their looks.

51
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:51,110
- What are you talking about?
- Where are you going with this?

52
00:03:51,235 --> 00:03:52,228
This way.

53
00:03:53,338 --> 00:03:54,984
Look at the seams.

54
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,950
These shoulder seams
here... Pulled apart...

55
00:03:59,075 --> 00:04:00,940
And the way he's lying so straight

56
00:04:01,065 --> 00:04:03,409
like this, and that shoe
that has come off.

57
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,740
No, we all noticed. Somebody
must have dragged him here.

58
00:04:05,865 --> 00:04:08,414
Yes, but dragged him from where?
And why?

59
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:12,293
Care to tell us, frank?

60
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,501
I don't know what
you're talking about.

61
00:04:15,626 --> 00:04:17,298
All right, then let me explain.

62
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:21,051
You and miss duane came up here
to have sex in the boss' office.

63
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,678
That's absurd. Why would
I do such a stupid thing?

64
00:04:22,846 --> 00:04:25,275
Well, because it's forbidden, and
thus, very sexy, of course,

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,683
Especially if you
have father issues.

66
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,105
And who doesn't?

67
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,105
It's a furtive but powerful
challenge to the paternal authority.

68
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,885
So you open up a.p.'s
office and then,

69
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:38,265
"crap. There's a dead body.
What are we gonna do?"

70
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,156
You gotta report it, but how do you
explain your presence in his office?

71
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:43,745
A quick but dirty solution...

72
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:47,874
You drag the body out and lock the
doors back up before calling the police.

73
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,201
Who is this guy?

74
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:52,165
He's a pain in the
ass, but he's making sense.

75
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,726
You sure you don't want
to change your statement?

76
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:54,543
No.

77
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:57,004
Oh, please, frank, it'd
be silly to deny it.

78
00:04:57,172 --> 00:05:00,355
Five minutes in a room with
the persuasive agent Cho,

79
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,430
And miss duane will tell all.

80
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:04,824
Back off, man.

81
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,435
I want to. Believe me. I have
zero interest in your sex life.

82
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,048
But one thing that occurs to me...

83
00:05:10,173 --> 00:05:13,312
A room like this would have
security cameras in it, yeah?

84
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:14,364
Yes.

85
00:05:14,489 --> 00:05:17,024
But surely, you wouldn't knowingly

86
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:20,110
record yourself making love
on the boss' carpet.

87
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:23,095
You'd have to know that the
cameras in the room were off,

88
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,669
Probably because you turned them
off, being the head of security.

89
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:27,970
They are off, aren't they, frank?

90
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,110
So the question now is, frank, how
long have they been off,

91
00:05:32,235 --> 00:05:35,084
And who else might have known
they were gonna be off last night?

92
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,580
You guys can take it
from here. I am starving.

93
00:05:37,705 --> 00:05:40,673
Gotta get me some eggs.
Garrity's, right? Thanks.

94
00:05:41,086 --> 00:05:42,967
You ready to tell us the truth?

95
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,167
Hey, look at this.

96
00:05:56,453 --> 00:05:59,441
It's known as "the moro,"
from 14th century italy.

97
00:05:59,892 --> 00:06:01,986
It's a portrait of somebody
named carlotta moro.

98
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,315
It's the only known works of an
artist known as the "siennese master."

99
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,866
It's been owned by two popes,
the king of France

100
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,165
and john jacob astor, among others.

101
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,895
But a.p. caid bought it for
$50 million 3 months ago.

102
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,313
What do we know about caid?

103
00:06:15,438 --> 00:06:17,988
Apart from he's
an idiot with his money?

104
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:22,553
Like the cover says, he got his
start as a roughneck in the oil fields

105
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,944
Then turned into a wildcatter and
made a fortune by the time he was 30.

106
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:28,345
He's a tough guy.
His trick's pulling oil out of places

107
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,612
- nobody else has the balls to go.
- Where is he now?

108
00:06:30,737 --> 00:06:32,723
He's somewhere on a sailboat.
He's been told what's going on.

109
00:06:32,848 --> 00:06:34,485
He's coming back as quick as he can.

110
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:37,706
I was thinking, it would have been easy for
him to sail up or down the coast a few miles,

111
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,610
Put into a small marina and come back and
commit the crime without anybody else knowing.

112
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:43,176
- And why would he want to do that?
- I'm just saying he could.

113
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:45,532
Maybe he wants the insurance money
or he wants to get rid of harry.

114
00:06:45,657 --> 00:06:46,989
Doesn't like that he's
married to his daughter.

115
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:48,846
Did you check with
caid's security team?

116
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:51,470
Everybody at the company that didn't
wear a suit knew all about frank schiappa

117
00:06:51,595 --> 00:06:52,885
And his use of a.p.'s office.

118
00:06:53,010 --> 00:06:55,170
Any number of people might have
known the cameras were off last night.

119
00:06:55,295 --> 00:06:58,995
Sounds like we're gonna have to
check out any number of people.

120
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:00,919
- Where's jane?
- I don't know.

121
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,245
Well, find him.

122
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,270
I'm gonna go and talk
to lashley's wife.

123
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:07,955
You guys give caid's personnel
files a good hard look.

124
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,024
See if there's any criminal
connections,

125
00:07:10,149 --> 00:07:12,570
- especially harry lashley.
- Do you think he's dirty?

126
00:07:12,695 --> 00:07:13,780
Well, he's involved.

127
00:07:13,905 --> 00:07:17,155
Why else would he be there
in the middle of the night?

128
00:07:20,044 --> 00:07:21,575
It doesn't feel real.

129
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,875
If it wasn't for you
people, i wouldn't believe it.

130
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,004
Harry's going to walk through the door,
and this is all just a strange dream.

131
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,533
But here you are. Harry's dead.

132
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,825
When was the last
time you spoke to him?

133
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,485
Yesterday afternoon.

134
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:38,170
Just chitchat, where
to go for dinner.

135
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:41,465
Then he left me a message
canceling, didn't say why.

136
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,421
That wasn't unusual, canceling
without giving any reason?

137
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,339
No.

138
00:07:45,606 --> 00:07:48,092
Harry was very
hardworking, very keen.

139
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,636
Stuff would come up all the time.

140
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,097
What was his job here exactly?

141
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:55,345
Good question.

142
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,425
He was a sort of
jack-of-all-trades for my father,

143
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,965
Did whatever he needed
from week to week.

144
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,570
My father liked having someone
on hand with no ties

145
00:08:04,695 --> 00:08:06,652
or friendships within the company.

146
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,920
That's a tough assignment.

147
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:09,783
Yes.

148
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,715
But he only joined the
company when we were married.

149
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,453
He was... Learning the ropes.

1
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,985
Your father didn't want harry to have a
soft ride just 'cause he was your husband.

2
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,708
Yes, you could put it like that.

3
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,920
- What was his previous employment?
- He was a musician.

4
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:27,435
Jazz guitarist.

5
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,860
Yes. How did you know that?

6
00:08:29,985 --> 00:08:32,330
I looked at his fingers...
Guitarist fingers.

7
00:08:32,455 --> 00:08:34,981
Jazz with a flamenco edge, judging

8
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,835
judging by the ridge on his thumb.

9
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:37,673
Yes.

10
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:40,559
He was playing a gig at one
of these ghastly,

11
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:42,220
events you have to go to,

12
00:08:42,345 --> 00:08:44,425
And you struck up a conversation.

13
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:47,398
You love jazz, so you could talk
with him easily,

14
00:08:47,523 --> 00:08:48,683
which, normally,

15
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:51,758
Is quite difficult for
you out side of business.

16
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:53,996
I... W... Yes.

17
00:08:54,121 --> 00:08:55,369
That's... But...

18
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,995
I'm sorry, miss caid.
He's just showing off.

19
00:08:59,155 --> 00:09:00,989
C-can you think of any reason

20
00:09:01,114 --> 00:09:04,764
why harry would have been
on this floor at that time of night?

21
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:06,312
No.

22
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,257
He would have known that
neither I nor my father were here.

23
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:11,280
So?

24
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,922
I understand from my
understand from my assistant

25
00:09:14,047 --> 00:09:15,912
That frank schiappa's
misbehavior was

26
00:09:16,037 --> 00:09:18,098
an open secret amongst
the junior staff.

27
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,309
He's no longer a caid employee.

28
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,648
Perhaps harry had found out,

29
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:26,190
and he was trying to catch him.

30
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,441
Perhaps.

31
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,771
Or is it possible
that he had prior knowledge

32
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:32,195
that the theft was gonna take place?

33
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,823
You're asking if he could have
been complicit in the theft?

34
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:36,874
- Yes, i am.
- No.

35
00:09:37,642 --> 00:09:39,953
He was honest and gentle.

36
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:41,241
No.

37
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,415
So he never talked to
you about the painting?

38
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:44,635
No.

39
00:09:45,123 --> 00:09:47,125
I didn't approve of buying it.

40
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:51,254
$50 million is far too much
money to spend on a single object.

41
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,512
When it comes to art, rational
arguments don't apply for him.

42
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,025
That would be kathryn
hawkes' area of expertise.

43
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,445
Kathryn hawkes? She is...

44
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,345
She buys the art for
my father's collection.

45
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,645
It's a terrible tragedy. Terrible.

46
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:10,195
Did you know Mr. Lashley?

47
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,220
Not well. I mean,
i knew of him, obviously but,

48
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:15,530
the poor man. It's very sad.

49
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:18,615
But you think the loss of the
painting is the real tragedy here.

50
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,747
Well, no.

51
00:10:20,443 --> 00:10:22,801
Every human life is a sacred thing.

52
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,254
But "the moro" is a uniquely
beautiful treasure, beyond precious.

53
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,009
You know the art market.

54
00:10:29,134 --> 00:10:32,155
Who would be willing and able
to steal such a high-end piece?

55
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,705
Worldwide, there's probably a good
hundred collectors with the resources

56
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,745
And passion enough to
do something like this,

57
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:38,682
But...

58
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:41,022
it's public knowledge that Mr. Caid

59
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:43,555
outbid shirali arlov
to get the "the moro".

60
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,143
Mr. Arlov is not pleased.

61
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,604
Shirali arlov...
The russian oil baron?

62
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,772
Him.

63
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,555
Arlov is a nasty piece of work.

64
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,265
He has a legit front as an oilman, but
he's a super rich gangster, basically.

65
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,509
They say he likes his business rivals to
be delivered to him hog-tied and naked

66
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:02,411
so he can kill 'em personally.

67
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:03,855
Vicious, reedy

68
00:11:04,172 --> 00:11:06,831
and the owner of the finest
collection of renaissance paintings in russia.

69
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:08,233
Sounds likes our kinda guy.

70
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:10,120
Talk to the organized
crime boys upstairs.

71
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:12,595
Find out who arlov's
connections are in california,

72
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,335
Who he'd use for a job like this
and where they were last night.

73
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,717
You got it, boss.

74
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:20,315
- What do you have?
- Harry lashley has a past.

75
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,444
Ten years ago in canada, he stole cash
from a video store he was working at.

76
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,605
Busted and served six months.

77
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,229
- Damn. I was hoping he was clean.
- Yeah, i know.

78
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,833
Then I tried to find any connection
he had to the art world,

79
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,408
and this popped up.

80
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:36,945
A month ago,he paid a company
called r.w.arts $20,000.

81
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:40,085
That's pretty much the only financial
transaction he's made recently.

82
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:43,765
- What's r. w. arts?
- I don't know yet. Shell, probably.

83
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:47,414
The address is just a mailbox in
lockesdale, a little farming town up north.

84
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:51,460
That's interesting. Let's van
pelt and I go up and take a look-see.

85
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:54,054
You and van pelt?

86
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:57,466
Well, she's from a small
farming town. Aren't you?

87
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,717
Yes, i am.

88
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:02,346
Right. Well, that's what you
guys call, uh, what is it? Cover.

89
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,035
What do you need cover
for? You're a cbi operative.

90
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,544
I thought I was a "consultant."

91
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,814
Just follow procedure. Have fun.

92
00:12:14,272 --> 00:12:15,972
Where's the fun in that?

93
00:12:16,692 --> 00:12:17,750
Shall we?

94
00:12:44,293 --> 00:12:45,654
How cute is this?

95
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:49,643
It sure doesn't look like the
lair of high-end art thieves.

96
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,961
Not at all. Flowers and fruit...

97
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:57,609
"rob wallace gallery and framing."

98
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,390
Bingo.

99
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,300
Let's not start with the badge.

100
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:06,605
Let's get the lay of the land first,
then we use the badge if we have to.

101
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,538
Well,

102
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:08,623
okay.

103
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,790
- But don't embarrass me.
- What do you mean?

104
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,793
- You know what I mean.
- No. What do you mean?

105
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,259
Morning, folks.

106
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:22,134
Look around, make yourself at home.

107
00:13:22,897 --> 00:13:23,882
Will do.

108
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,580
I know what you're thinking.

109
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,940
You do?

110
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,037
You're thinking my fiancée
is a lot younger than me.

111
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,050
Oh, no.

112
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:54,911
Well, she is.

113
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,485
I'll let you in on a little secret.

114
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,422
I was her college
professor, seduced her.

115
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,417
No kidding.

116
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,575
Her parents hated it.
A lot of drama.

117
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,320
Totally worth it, though.
Right, babe?

118
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:11,145
Okay, that's what I
mean. Come on. Stop it.

119
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,268
Oh, that's good. He's good.

120
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:21,067
Do you think you could do
a portrait of my fiancée?

121
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,268
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you bet.

122
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:25,143
- No.
- Who's the boss in this relationship?

123
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,199
He's just playing the fool.

124
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:29,270
Stop it now.

125
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,045
Okay, turn just a little
to your left. There.

126
00:14:40,415 --> 00:14:41,174
Good.

127
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,150
Looks good.

128
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:51,223
Just... Just make sure you don't
do her eyes too close together.

129
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,325
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm
getting in your space.

130
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,244
Where's your facilities?

131
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:02,255
Down the hall, door on the right.

132
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,362
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.

133
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,656
Just not too close, you know?
You know what i'm saying?

134
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,036
Yeah.

135
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:23,907
Just, passing through town, are you?

136
00:15:24,032 --> 00:15:26,591
Yes, just passing through.

137
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,435
You have an excellent nose.

138
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,560
Thank you.

139
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,750
How long have you lived here?

140
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,460
All my life.

141
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:20,645
Do you mind if I ask
you a personal question?

142
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,905
That depends, i suppose.

143
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,857
Go ahead.

144
00:16:25,154 --> 00:16:27,904
How long have you and
patrick been together?

145
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:29,237
Not long.

146
00:16:30,302 --> 00:16:31,663
Okay, i'm just gonna say it.

147
00:16:31,788 --> 00:16:33,450
Are you sure about
marrying this guy?

148
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:37,185
I mean, he kinda appears to
be a jerk. I mean, no offense.

149
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,623
Oh, no. Yes.

1
00:16:39,324 --> 00:16:41,905
I-i'm not marrying him.
That's... No.

2
00:16:42,862 --> 00:16:45,462
Don't worry about
that. Not gonna happen.

3
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,485
Hello.

4
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,495
Turn your head just to
the left a little bit.

5
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:15,091
Just a little bit more. A
little bit more to your left.

6
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:18,398
Just, that's great.
Hold that, okay?

7
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,166
Look down.

8
00:17:20,957 --> 00:17:21,957
Hold that.

9
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,752
This way, i'm gonna have a lot
of light on your...

10
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,067
cheekbones.

11
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:31,790
You're gonna be so amazed
with how good this looks...

12
00:17:32,104 --> 00:17:33,748
The facial structure.

13
00:17:36,855 --> 00:17:37,676
Okay,

14
00:17:37,801 --> 00:17:38,824
stand up!

15
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,966
Puts your hands in the air.

16
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,810
OK

17
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:00,912
Move. Move.

18
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,414
*Steady!* *Steady!*

19
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,845
Mr. Wallace, if you'd just
let me show you my badge,

20
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:11,645
We're from the california
bureau of investigation.

21
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:13,080
Our office knows we're here.

22
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:15,160
If you kill us, they'll
know who did it.

23
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:17,320
Kill you?
Why would I want to kill you?

24
00:18:17,445 --> 00:18:19,445
- You're cops?
- Well, she...

25
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,145
We're investigating the
murder of harry lashley.

26
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,523
Lashley's dead?

27
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,275
What happened? I...

28
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,205
We were hoping you might
be able to tell us that,

29
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:33,849
considering you have
the stolen painting.

30
00:18:33,974 --> 00:18:35,970
No, that's... That's a copy.

31
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:39,242
Mr. Wallace here is a-an art forger,

32
00:18:39,801 --> 00:18:42,101
a very... Very good one, by the way.

33
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:45,540
That's a copy. He's not a thief.

34
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,230
Well, give me the shotgun.

35
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,190
Mr. Lashley came to me
a couple of months ago

36
00:18:57,315 --> 00:18:59,998
and commissioned
two copies of "the moro."

37
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,931
How did he find you?

38
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,860
People who need my services
tend to find me eventually.

39
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,481
It's not a crime, what I do.

40
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,390
If you have a valuable painting,

41
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:13,555
it's only sensible to have
a copy made for the display,

42
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,255
So that way, the real thing's safe.

43
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,656
He picked up the copies
about a month ago.

44
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,529
So you gave him two copies already?

45
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,328
What's this one for?

46
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,442
This one I did for myself.

47
00:19:26,757 --> 00:19:28,958
It's a beautiful picture.
I'd come to love her.

48
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,961
Why did he want two copies?

49
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,923
- He didn't say.
- And you didn't ask questions.

50
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:38,605
He paid me $10,000 for each of them,

51
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:41,100
so no,i didn't ask any questions.

52
00:19:42,305 --> 00:19:44,325
How do we know this
isn't the real thing?

53
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,540
I'm not a forger. I'm an artist.

54
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:48,970
I'm not trying to
trick anyone. Okay?

55
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:51,137
I always added detail that ensures

56
00:19:51,262 --> 00:19:53,535
that nobody can sell
my work as the genuine article.

57
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,693
That's very ethical of you.

58
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:58,190
It looks pretty much
exactly the same to me.

59
00:19:58,315 --> 00:20:00,698
No, he's telling the
truth. Take a closer look.

60
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,497
- What am I looking for?
- Closer.

61
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,709
Oh, i still don't...

62
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:14,650
You're getting warmer.

63
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,955
A tv aerial.

64
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:21,920
- Yes.
- They didn't have tv.

65
00:20:22,045 --> 00:20:23,699
No. Beautiful work.

66
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,235
May I borrow it for a while?

67
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,898
I don't know about that. How...
How do I know i'm gonna get it back?

68
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:33,125
Let me put it another way.

69
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,280
Lend it to me or agent van pelt here

70
00:20:35,405 --> 00:20:37,470
will take you and the painting
back to sacramento

71
00:20:37,595 --> 00:20:39,850
And keep you there and ask you

72
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:42,365
mind-numbing questions
for hours and hours on end.

73
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:45,869
Thank you.

74
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,872
Copies? Clever.

75
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,070
Harry and his accomplices
steal the painting once,

76
00:20:51,195 --> 00:20:52,955
but they get to sell it three times.

77
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,145
Hey, boss.
A.p. caid's back from his trip.

78
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,630
He's on his way back to his office.

79
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,930
No, no, no. You got it all wrong.

80
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:09,075
See, i told harry to get a
copy made on the hush-hush.

81
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,536
I mean, what kind of idiot is gonna put $50
million on his wall

82
00:21:12,661 --> 00:21:14,105
so anybody can steal it?

83
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,025
So the painting that
was stolen is a fake?

84
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,875
Damn right, it was.

85
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,265
Now the real one is
in my... Private vault.

86
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:24,595
With all due respect, a.p., the
art here is my responsibility.

87
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,835
Kathryn, the fewer people
who knew, the better.

88
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,250
Besides, it paid off,
didn't it, huh?

89
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:32,045
I mean, right now there's some
thieving son of a bitch out there

90
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:34,345
Who spent a whole
lot of money on junk.

91
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,152
Daddy, harry's dead.

92
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,483
Oh, baby, i know. I'm sorry. I know.

93
00:21:39,608 --> 00:21:43,051
It's too sad, but, uh, you
know, i did like that kid.

94
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,655
Can we see the painting?

95
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,597
You want to see my baby?
I'll open the vault.

96
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,565
Ain't she a beauty?

97
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,190
- You, mind if I take a closer look?
- No. Oh, yeah, yeah.

98
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,611
A masterpiece of quattrocento
portraiture, one of a kind.

99
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,875
$50 million right there.

100
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,158
It's about $10,000
right there. It's a fake.

101
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:10,638
- The hell it is.
- Fake as a $6 bill.

102
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:12,390
That's not funny, son.

103
00:22:12,515 --> 00:22:15,875
Take a look back here by the
trees, the guys on horseback.

104
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,625
The third one in from the
left, next to the footmen...

105
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,714
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see
the horses. What...

106
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,217
What do you think, is that
an m16 or a kalashnikov?

107
00:22:24,775 --> 00:22:27,640
- Son of a bitch.
- Yeah, i think it's a kalashnikov.

108
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:29,595
Son of a bitch. There's...

109
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,575
There's a machine
gun in my painting.

110
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,690
How in the hell could
you not notice that?

111
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:35,720
If this bozo here can
see it, why couldn't you?

112
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:38,120
- A.p. i can assure you, the painting...
- No, no, no, no.

113
00:22:38,245 --> 00:22:39,925
You're the one who has the good eye.

114
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,375
No, you brought me a fake.

115
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,140
Mr. Caid, i can state with
absolute certainty the painting

116
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:48,645
Which I purchased for you and
placed in your hands was genuine.

117
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,095
I have the documents to prove it.

118
00:22:51,425 --> 00:22:55,429
If you chose to engage in some clever
subterfuge without my knowledge,

119
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,483
I can hardly be blamed
for the results.

120
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:03,555
- Excuse me.
- Harry. That son of a bitch harry...

121
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,467
He switched out the real
painting for the fake one.

122
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:09,637
And then bludgeoned himself to death, i
suppose? You have no basis for that.

123
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,480
That was probably one of his crackhead
musician friends he brought along.

124
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:14,502
You don't know that.
That's not fair.

125
00:23:14,627 --> 00:23:17,225
Were you aware
he spent time in prison?

126
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,440
6 months for theft in
canada,10 years ago.

127
00:23:21,990 --> 00:23:22,700
Yes.

128
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:28,258
I mean, no, i didn't.
Um, i-i'm sure it doesn't...

129
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:31,075
I'm sure it's not...

130
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,590
- It was ten years ago.
- I knew it.

131
00:23:33,715 --> 00:23:36,307
I knew it.
This guy was no good for you.

132
00:23:36,432 --> 00:23:39,595
I could feel it, but
I kept quiet, didn't i?

133
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,495
For your sake, i forced
myself to trust this guy.

134
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,125
Because you finally
had yourself a man.

135
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,689
He stole $50 million from me.

136
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,110
Damn it, stevie.

137
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,668
Please.

138
00:23:54,377 --> 00:23:56,601
I beg you. Find
my husband's murderer.

139
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,895
That's what we're
trying to do, ma'am.

140
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,016
They'll tell you the truth.

141
00:24:02,141 --> 00:24:03,623
I want the truth.

142
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,573
You can go now.

143
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,530
That's all we need at the
moment. We'll be in touch.

144
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:16,899
Right.

145
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,845
I hate to be blunt, Mr.
Caid, but you're just...

146
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:26,339
- Let's... Oh, no, you don't.
- We'll... We'll talk later.

147
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:27,949
Harry has copies made,

148
00:24:28,074 --> 00:24:30,478
but he doesn't hang one on the wall
to disguise the robbery. Why?

1
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:31,940
Because it was part of the plan.

2
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:34,620
Everyone has to know the painting was
stolen for him to have anything to sell.

3
00:24:34,745 --> 00:24:35,960
The painting has to be missing.

4
00:24:36,085 --> 00:24:39,320
So he makes the switch, goes to
steal the real painting off the wall,

5
00:24:39,445 --> 00:24:42,188
Knowing frisky frank has
turned the cameras off.

6
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:44,035
So who kills him then?

7
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,405
Whoever ended up delivering
the painting to a buyer.

8
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:48,429
Harry outlived his
usefulness the minute

9
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:51,295
he used his security pass
to get into a. P.'S office.

10
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:54,765
Well, we just heard from the organized
crime boys about shirali arlov.

11
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:55,940
- We did?
- Yeah.

12
00:24:56,065 --> 00:24:59,580
The good news is he's in california...
L. A. He arrived a couple of days ago.

13
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,325
Well, that can't be a coincidence.

14
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,510
All right, what's the bad news?

15
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:05,670
The bad news is he's traveling
on a diplomatic passport.

16
00:25:05,825 --> 00:25:07,925
We cannot touch him
under any circumstances.

17
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:09,748
If we could just ask
him a couple questions...

18
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:12,735
State department was
crystal clear... Keep away.

19
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,595
Arlov controls an oil pipeline
route this country needs.

20
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,240
It's a national security issue.

21
00:25:17,365 --> 00:25:19,502
Another argument for
energy independence there.

22
00:25:19,627 --> 00:25:20,935
Where's he staying?

23
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,645
I repeat, do not touch.

24
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,513
Oh, no, no. No touching.

25
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:27,814
I promise.

26
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:05,915
Nope, nyet, no, and minelli
says no, too. That's four nos.

27
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,630
Minelli always says no.
It's his job.

28
00:26:07,755 --> 00:26:10,815
- And it's my job to listen to him.
- You'd walk away?

29
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,485
If arlov is our man, you'd
let him get away with murder?

30
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,095
He didn't do the murder.

31
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,145
He probably bought the
painting from the murderer.

32
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,028
We'll never know unless
we go talk to him.

33
00:26:20,153 --> 00:26:22,755
We're gonna close this case, but not
by causing an international scandal.

34
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,884
Arlov's the key.

35
00:26:24,009 --> 00:26:27,084
I want to get harry lashley's killer
as much as you do,

36
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:28,794
but we cannot go after arlov.

37
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,713
- The state department...
- A fig to the state department.

38
00:26:30,881 --> 00:26:32,631
Yeah, i agree. Screw 'em.

39
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:35,595
That attitude is why i'm in
charge and you guys aren't.

40
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,675
And would you please leave some
of those for everybody else?

41
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,388
They're so small.

42
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,392
I just don't understand why a law

43
00:26:47,517 --> 00:26:49,774
officer can't go after
a known criminal.

44
00:26:50,922 --> 00:26:52,024
Damn right.

45
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,822
If we left now,
we could be in l. A. before dark.

46
00:26:57,389 --> 00:26:58,120
What?

47
00:26:58,245 --> 00:27:01,495
Tell cho to meet us in the
parking lot in ten minutes.

48
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,057
- Hello?
- You ready?

49
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:24,777
Yeah.

50
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,895
- Are you ready?
- I'm ready. What's the signal?

51
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:30,570
- "she is beautiful."
- Good.

52
00:27:31,411 --> 00:27:32,441
Let's do this.

53
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:10,688
Could you tell Mr.
Arlov patrick jane is here?

54
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,765
I have "the moro" portrait that
was stolen a couple days ago.

55
00:28:14,890 --> 00:28:16,775
I'd like to sell it to him.

56
00:28:37,354 --> 00:28:38,104
What?

57
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:42,805
Let him come in.

58
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,220
Thank you.

59
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,815
Good evening.

60
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:58,950
Please sit.

61
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:11,875
"World's best collisions."
You know this show?

62
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,672
No.

63
00:29:12,797 --> 00:29:14,611
Oh, you should check it out.

64
00:29:14,736 --> 00:29:17,655
It's, very amusing and, educational.

65
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,663
It's a lesson for us all.

66
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:21,941
Anytime, anyplace, boom...

67
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:26,780
- Your life can be over.
- That's very true.

68
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:30,197
Would you like a drink, a snack?

69
00:29:30,695 --> 00:29:33,687
Yes, sparkling water. Please.

70
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,817
No ice, room temperature.

71
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,750
******

72
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,405
Where is everyone?

73
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,335
Weird. They all
called in to sign out.

74
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,265
Jane wasn't feeling well, rigsby's got
a hot date, and cho got kings tickets.

75
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,680
- Son of a...
- What?

76
00:29:58,805 --> 00:30:02,290
Jane doesn't get sick, rigsby's not on
a date because he's in love with you,

77
00:30:02,415 --> 00:30:04,280
- And the kings aren't playing tonight.
- You know about that?

78
00:30:04,405 --> 00:30:05,790
Yeah, they're on
an east coast road trip.

79
00:30:05,915 --> 00:30:07,142
They're playing the
knicks tomorrow night.

80
00:30:07,267 --> 00:30:09,150
No, i mean, about rigsby...
How do you know about that?

81
00:30:09,275 --> 00:30:11,684
Everybody knows that. The
attorney general knows that.

82
00:30:11,852 --> 00:30:13,936
- I'm so embarrassed.
- Please.

83
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,850
Pick up the phone, damn it.

84
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,845
Thank you.

85
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,912
So...

86
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,139
Mr. Patrick jane.

87
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:42,256
You have a painting
you want to sell me?

88
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,294
"The carlotta moro"?

89
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:45,509
Yes.

90
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:50,091
- I don't believe you.
- Would you like to take a look?

91
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,498
Sure.

92
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:13,055
- Are you mad?
- No, i'm just kidding. Kidding.

93
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,645
It's just a prop to
get me into the room.

94
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,571
I am aware that you
have the real painting.

95
00:31:17,696 --> 00:31:19,925
Oh, really? You are aware?

96
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,216
And how are you aware of this?

97
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,560
A guess, confirmed by a
predatory smile on your face

98
00:31:27,685 --> 00:31:30,010
When you asked me
about it just then.

99
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:33,775
You enjoy trapping people in nets
of their own making, don't you?

100
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,025
That's... That's, that's
very perceptive of you.

101
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,207
Not really.

102
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:44,255
Most successful criminal bosses
share a similar profile...

103
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,956
Sadistic, violent,

104
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:50,204
but also highly
methodical and psychologically astute.

105
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,955
Why are you here, Mr. Jane?

106
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,124
I'm a detective of sorts.

107
00:32:11,193 --> 00:32:11,973
Explain.

108
00:32:12,098 --> 00:32:14,110
I'm trying to find out
who killed harry lashley.

109
00:32:14,235 --> 00:32:14,965
Who?

110
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,768
The man who died in the
course of the painting's theft.

111
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,229
Oh, yes, yes, i recall. Poor fellow.

112
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,978
If you're looking for a bribe,
i'm afraid,

113
00:32:23,103 --> 00:32:24,555
you're running out of luck.

114
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,946
You see, you do understand that

115
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:29,354
I have immunity from
prosecution in this country?

116
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:31,195
I know, i know. No touching.

117
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:34,577
I show you my identification
to discourage you from killing me

118
00:32:34,745 --> 00:32:37,050
or torturing me or something.

119
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,374
You might not get arrested for it, but
you sure will make some kind of a fuss.

120
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,065
Oh, i don't mind fuss, you know?

121
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,645
Anything to avoid boredom.

122
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:47,381
Given your immunity, you could tell me
who you bought the painting from

123
00:32:47,549 --> 00:32:48,890
and do no harm to yourself.

124
00:32:49,015 --> 00:32:50,535
And inform to the police? Why?

125
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,078
Why on earth would I do that?

126
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:54,590
Harry lashley didn't deserve to die.

127
00:32:54,715 --> 00:32:58,670
He has a wife who needs to know
what happened. She deserves justice.

128
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,938
Are you serious? "She
deserves justice," huh?

129
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:06,317
Perhaps you haven't paid the
full price for the painting yet.

130
00:33:06,722 --> 00:33:10,145
Perhaps an arrest would
save you some... Money.

131
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:12,855
Oh, well, that's...
That's not a bad thought.

132
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,395
But you see,

133
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,435
i-i love my art collection.

134
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:20,303
I-i love beauty.
It's why I do what I do, you know?

135
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:22,457
Who would want to sell to me

136
00:33:22,582 --> 00:33:24,556
if I start sending
my suppliers to jail, you know?

137
00:33:24,681 --> 00:33:25,431
True.

138
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:29,006
Well, i thought it was worth a try.

139
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:32,455
Thank you, and i'm sorry
for wasting your time.

140
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,335
Oh, no, no, no.
Not at all. Not at all.

141
00:33:35,571 --> 00:33:39,484
You are a very... Very
strange kind of policeman.

142
00:33:39,609 --> 00:33:41,018
It's been most diverting.

143
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:42,978
Could I see it before I leave...

144
00:33:43,888 --> 00:33:44,870
The moro?

145
00:33:45,145 --> 00:33:47,005
I'm told it's very beautiful.

146
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,670
Oh, you... You appreciate art, huh?

147
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:53,362
Why not? Of course.

148
00:34:01,676 --> 00:34:04,126
- What's happening?
- Soon. Get ready.

1
00:34:06,910 --> 00:34:08,067
Here you go.

2
00:34:08,192 --> 00:34:11,340
Look at that. It's
a... An italian silk merchant's wife.

3
00:34:11,508 --> 00:34:14,420
It's 600 years old.
It's... And it's alive.

4
00:34:14,545 --> 00:34:16,303
It's... It's immortal.

5
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,650
May i?

6
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:23,337
Please. Please.

7
00:34:26,032 --> 00:34:29,650
Now I understand why you went
to such lengths to get her.

8
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:32,319
- She is beautiful.
- Now.

9
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,536
Everybody out.

10
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,011
Out. Out. Out.

11
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,029
Please, out.

12
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,753
Out. Out!

13
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:53,612
Out!

14
00:35:00,616 --> 00:35:01,766
Well? Well?

15
00:35:02,319 --> 00:35:03,103
Yes!

16
00:35:05,097 --> 00:35:06,960
You better call
lisbon, give her an update.

17
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:08,175
You call her.

18
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,305
- Oh, i can't. I'm driving. Cho?
- No way.

19
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,986
Oh, come on, guys. I just robbed a
russian mobster. You can't call lisbon?

20
00:35:18,138 --> 00:35:19,908
You gonna be grumpy
like this in the room?

21
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:20,934
Yes, i am.

22
00:35:21,059 --> 00:35:23,410
I'm just asking. I don't
think it's very professional.

23
00:35:23,535 --> 00:35:26,180
- Seriously, don't push me.
- I said I was sorry.

24
00:35:26,305 --> 00:35:28,751
You had express orders
to stay away from arlov.

25
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,260
But that's why I didn't tell
you. You have total deniability.

26
00:35:31,385 --> 00:35:32,417
But that's beside the point.

27
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:34,695
The point is, my brilliant
plan worked like clockwork.

28
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:37,850
What plan? This case is not closed.
You haven't done anything yet.

29
00:35:37,975 --> 00:35:39,845
Not yet, but you watch.

30
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,930
No, i disagree.

31
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,141
Morning!

32
00:35:45,515 --> 00:35:47,227
I'll get back to you.

33
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,067
What the hell?

34
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,862
You got it back. Ing her to me.

35
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,653
Oh, baby!

36
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,283
This is fabulous. Was
it arlov? Did he have it?

37
00:36:01,834 --> 00:36:02,725
Yes, it was.

38
00:36:02,850 --> 00:36:04,550
How did you get it back?

39
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,315
- I stole it.
- Are you serious?

40
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:11,075
Well, there was nothing we
could do legally, as you said.

41
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,620
But arlov was in possession
of a stolen painting.

42
00:36:13,745 --> 00:36:15,957
So there was nothing
he could do either.

43
00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:18,125
This gets better and better.

44
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,385
First of all, i get
the painting back.

45
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:21,388
Second,

46
00:36:21,859 --> 00:36:24,556
when arlov finds out
that i've got it, it'll kill him.

47
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,635
Who cares about arlov?

48
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,311
Who cares about the damn painting?

49
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:32,825
You assured me you would
find harry's killer.

50
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,700
We're doing everything we can,
stevie,

51
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,474
but there's not a lot
left for us to do.

52
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:38,695
Look, stevie, i know you loved him.

53
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,255
And I liked him, too, but
he was part of this theft.

54
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,665
He betrayed me.

55
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,185
In a way, this is a good
thing that he's gone,

56
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:48,105
Because you could be having children
with this bum right now. All right?

57
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,565
You think of that. We
dodged a bullet here.

58
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,455
Come on, give me a hug.

59
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,712
Look, we're gonna
find you a good man.

60
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:59,299
The main thing is we sent
out a message here that

61
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,632
nobody messes with

62
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,805
a.p. caid.
Thank you, thank you.

63
00:37:14,918 --> 00:37:16,316
I had a daughter once.

64
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,630
She died.

65
00:37:21,379 --> 00:37:23,323
Killed. It was my fault.

66
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,430
That's how I know that a ma,

67
00:37:26,555 --> 00:37:28,040
who treats his only daughter
the way you do is a fool.

68
00:37:28,165 --> 00:37:29,735
- Jane.
- What did you say?

69
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:32,917
Your child is hurting, and you're
crowing over this petty victory

70
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,390
like a cockerel on a dung heap.

71
00:37:35,515 --> 00:37:38,492
You're a blind, vain, emotionally
stunted fool.

72
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,385
You care more about this...

73
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,575
For this painting,
for all this rubbish...

74
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,929
Than you do the child
that loves you.

75
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,895
You found my painting.
I am grateful.

76
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,352
And now i'm going to be patient

77
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:55,485
and tell you,
you get this clown out of my office...

78
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:57,150
- How am I gonna make you understand?
- Right now.

79
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,795
How am I gonna make you
understand? See this?

80
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,019
- Jane...
- See this?

81
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,725
This is nothing. It's nothing.

82
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,225
- What are you doing?
- Jane!

83
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,033
- Don't!
- What are you, nuts?

84
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,020
Jane? Jane, have you gone crazy?

85
00:38:09,145 --> 00:38:10,954
Oh, no, no.
I'm just doing my job. Look.

86
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,590
You'd think that someone that has
dedicated their lives to fine art

87
00:38:13,715 --> 00:38:16,280
would want to save a masterpiece
from burning up. Wouldn't you?

88
00:38:16,405 --> 00:38:19,045
Unless she already knew
it was just another fake.

89
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:21,673
No, not at all. I'm just...
I'm just shocked, that's all.

90
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,385
- Is it a fake?
- Yes, it is.

91
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,231
I only found out after I stole it,
but kathryn knew, because

92
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:29,495
it was she who stole the original,

93
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:33,040
And it is she who still has
it in her safe possession.

94
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,313
- No.
- Is that true, kathryn?

95
00:38:36,475 --> 00:38:37,147
No.

96
00:38:38,203 --> 00:38:40,359
Horrible job you found
for yourself, kathryn...

97
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,904
Helping a greedy egotist snatch up

98
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:46,657
beautiful things he has
no ability to appreciate.

99
00:38:47,370 --> 00:38:49,730
And you don't get paid much, do you?

100
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,925
All the money, beauty around you,
and you can't have any of it.

101
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,081
Very frustrating.

102
00:38:57,590 --> 00:38:58,585
Not at all.

103
00:39:00,015 --> 00:39:02,381
Harry came to you for
advice about the painting.

104
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:06,550
You asked him to make a second
copy for your own personal use.

105
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:10,263
Did you blackmail him? Huh?

106
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:15,534
Must've known about the theft conviction
in canada, threatened to tell a.p.

107
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,355
And destroy the life he
was building with stevie.

108
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,285
Care to comment on that?

109
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:22,325
It's all nonsense, a. p.
It's nonsense.

110
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,085
Oh, is it? The reason you
had two copies made...

111
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:27,263
So that you could sell one to arlov,

112
00:39:27,388 --> 00:39:30,575
and you could keep
the original picture for yourself

113
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:35,174
because, Of course, you're the
only one that really deserves it.

114
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,040
It was her? She did it?

115
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,626
Yes. Like I switched
the paintings with arlov,

116
00:39:40,206 --> 00:39:42,355
She switched the original

117
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,325
with harry right before
it went into the vault.

118
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:48,798
All you had to do was come up in here
after hours

119
00:39:48,923 --> 00:39:50,971
and take it off the wall.

120
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:57,595
But harry suspected
something, didn't he?

121
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,479
He tried to stop you...

122
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,804
And you killed him.

123
00:40:12,785 --> 00:40:16,255
Tell the truth, kathryn. Our people are
g||ng through your apartment right now.

124
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,314
They will find that painting

125
00:40:18,439 --> 00:40:20,740
even if they have to tear
the place to the ground.

126
00:40:20,865 --> 00:40:23,045
There is no point in lying anymore.

127
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,138
I'm sorry.

128
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,134
I never meant to kill him.

129
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:31,303
Why did he try to stop me?

130
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:33,409
- No!
- No, no, baby. No, baby, don't.

131
00:40:33,534 --> 00:40:34,490
It was an accident.

132
00:40:34,615 --> 00:40:36,870
Kathryn, you're under arrest
for the murder of harry lashley.

133
00:40:36,995 --> 00:40:38,670
- Put your hands behind your back.
- Oh, i'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

134
00:40:38,795 --> 00:40:40,645
- It was a mistake.
- Come on. Let's go.

135
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:50,410
For what it's worth, i,

136
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,294
i just wanted to apologize
for my pious rant earlier.

137
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,913
I needed a pretext to
burn the picture, and...

138
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,655
Your family dysfunction became it.

139
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,975
Well, no, sir. No apology needed.

140
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:08,080
There was some good, hard
truth in what you said.

141
00:41:08,205 --> 00:41:09,530
Yes, there was,

142
00:41:10,026 --> 00:41:12,976
but you know, no
one likes to be too judgmental.

143
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,745
Hard to believe it's a fake.

144
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,940
Crazy, isn't it?

145
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,153
One painting's worth $50 million,
the other's only worth a few thousand.

146
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:34,074
- They look identical.
- Yep. Crazy.

147
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,287
Not that you mention
it, i'm not sure...

148
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,910
