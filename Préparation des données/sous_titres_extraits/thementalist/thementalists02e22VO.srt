1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,004
Where the hell is he, Stace?

2
00:00:17,217 --> 00:00:19,431
Don't worry, Mr. Lynch.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

3
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:22,730
This is ridiculous.
He goes on in less than five minutes.

4
00:00:28,677 --> 00:00:29,794
He's here.

5
00:00:29,919 --> 00:00:33,112
Get him up on stage
and I'll tell everybody he's on his way.

6
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:38,538
Mr. Brava,

7
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,581
We need to hurry.

8
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:43,709
No advance copy of your speech
has been released.

9
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,961
- Why the secrecy?
- Come hear it, and you'll know.

10
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,724
Can you tell us anything
about what you're going to say?

11
00:00:49,784 --> 00:00:51,008
You want a sound bite?

12
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,510
Fine.

13
00:00:52,678 --> 00:00:55,680
People who traffic in humans
are like cockroaches hiding in the dark.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,044
- You have to expose 'em to the light.
- What do you mean?

15
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,811
Will you be naming somebody?

16
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:07,182
I'll be right back.

17
00:01:39,863 --> 00:01:41,363
We really have to...

18
00:01:47,557 --> 00:01:49,275
Help me! Somebody, please!

19
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,119
Andy Burnside.
Kane county sheriff.

20
00:01:55,908 --> 00:01:58,804
Agent Teresa Lisbon.
This is Patrick Jane, our consultant.

21
00:02:00,102 --> 00:02:02,525
So the victim's name
was Hector Brava.

22
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:05,056
He was a do-gooder.
Ran an organization

23
00:02:05,181 --> 00:02:07,277
called
the Sheltering Light foundation.

24
00:02:07,402 --> 00:02:09,211
They fight human trafficking.

25
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:13,140
He was supposed
to give some kind of a speech.

26
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,417
- So you're the psychic, huh?
- No. No such thing as psychics.

27
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,791
Looks like cause of death
is blunt force trauma.

28
00:02:29,916 --> 00:02:31,275
Yeah, some of my men

29
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,110
found a fire extinguisher
with blood.

30
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,029
No, usable prints on it, though.

31
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,364
What was he doing back here?

32
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,534
This.

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
It's a text message.

34
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,540
"Meet me through the staff door.
Carmen."

35
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:50,461
- Tracking the sender now.
- How many Carmen have you ID'd?

36
00:02:50,974 --> 00:02:52,546
Two employees at the hotel,

37
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,715
another two
were attending the conference.

38
00:02:55,164 --> 00:02:58,070
They all have alibis, though.
We're gonna keep looking.

39
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:00,339
He had his wallet on him,
all credit cards,

40
00:03:00,464 --> 00:03:02,264
a lot of money,
so you can rule robbery out.

41
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,099
Maybe.
Where's his speech?

42
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:08,896
You said he was going to give a speech.
Wouldn't he have that speech

43
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,264
on his person,

44
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,650
or notes at least?
Did you find anything?

45
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,532
- Find out everything about the speech.
- You got it.

46
00:03:23,887 --> 00:03:24,887
What?

47
00:03:26,823 --> 00:03:28,773
There's a contradiction here.

48
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:31,836
The murder itself feels improvised.

49
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:34,075
The fire extinguisher,
the semipublic location.

50
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,500
But the setup...

51
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,935
The text message was planned.

52
00:03:38,577 --> 00:03:40,227
No robbery to speak of.

53
00:03:41,195 --> 00:03:42,888
No assault other than the blow

54
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,156
to the head.

55
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,559
It doesn't feel like an anger killing.
But more

56
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,577
like an act of desperation.

57
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:51,291
The murderer wanted
to keep Brava from doing something

58
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,523
or saying something.

59
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:55,315
That's just what our psychic said.

60
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,612
- Your psychic?
- Kristina Frye.

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,822
You're kidding.

62
00:04:00,435 --> 00:04:01,907
What, you've heard of her?

63
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:06,662
Relax.

64
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:09,039
Don't force the memory.

65
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:11,772
It'll come,
and the details will emerge.

66
00:04:12,183 --> 00:04:13,883
How much you paying her?

67
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:15,796
- None of your business.
- That much?

68
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,114
I'm working for the wrong people.

69
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,092
Nice to see you again.

70
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,260
You, too.

71
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:22,636
Thank you.

72
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:24,825
You got the sheriff
wrapped around your finger.

73
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,932
He's a man with an admirably

74
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,809
- open mind.
- He's also a man

75
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,436
that likes to watch television

76
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:33,814
with a cat curled up asleep on his lap
while his mother knits.

77
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,775
But I'm sure
he'd prefer that to remain a secret.

78
00:04:38,952 --> 00:04:40,696
I thought you said
you weren't psychic.

79
00:04:40,942 --> 00:04:43,324
He is.
He's just not ready to accept it.

80
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:46,535
Actually,
it was the cat hair on your pants,

81
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:50,164
lack of wedding ring
and your general live-with-mom vibe.

82
00:04:51,038 --> 00:04:53,584
But if you want to believe
that his dead uncle Harry came down

83
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:55,419
and whispered it in my ear,
be my guest

84
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:57,379
Don't you get tired
of your cynicism?

85
00:04:57,702 --> 00:04:58,756
Weary as hell.

86
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,717
What's the alternative?

87
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,094
Why don't we give them
a little bit of time?

88
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,654
Sorry about the mom thing.

89
00:05:08,966 --> 00:05:11,602
2x22
~ Red Letter ~

90
00:05:21,089 --> 00:05:22,257
I have a question.

91
00:05:22,382 --> 00:05:24,615
What are you doing
working with the cops?

92
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,368
You were a spiritual psychoanalyst.
Did your patients catch on to you?

93
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:31,205
I still have my practice.
Why, you looking for a therapist?

94
00:05:31,968 --> 00:05:33,668
Let me think about that.

95
00:05:35,018 --> 00:05:37,336
I heard that psychoanalysts
are a disease

96
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:41,061
that present themselves as a cure.
And on top of that, you add in ghosts.

97
00:05:41,703 --> 00:05:44,343
Reflexive mockery,
a sign of a troubled soul.

98
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,445
You got bored, didn't you?

99
00:05:46,859 --> 00:05:48,472
Got too easy taking their money.

100
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:52,559
I think our gift obliges us
to help other people.

101
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:53,895
Is that what you think?

102
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,288
Our gift gives us an obligation to help.
I like that line. I'm gonna use it.

103
00:05:57,413 --> 00:05:59,493
Van pelt says there's a problem
tracing the message

104
00:05:59,618 --> 00:06:01,068
- that Brava got.
- What?

105
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:03,127
The trail leads
to an electronic dead drop.

106
00:06:03,252 --> 00:06:05,906
No way to trace it back.
But she's keep looking,

107
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,825
- run down those calls.
- And the speech?

108
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:09,952
No word yet on
if he had it on him or not.

109
00:06:10,077 --> 00:06:12,204
But we haven't talked to the wife
She's inside.

110
00:06:13,103 --> 00:06:15,483
Hector and I knew something like
this might happen.

111
00:06:15,608 --> 00:06:17,960
He said there was too much at stake
to waste time worrying.

112
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,586
What were you worried about?

113
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,054
The traffickers.

114
00:06:22,007 --> 00:06:24,383
People who profit
from the enslavement of others.

115
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:26,593
Hector was tireless
in his pursuit of them.

116
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:29,408
Is there anyone you can think
of who may have wanted to kill him?

117
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:32,558
My husband's received half a dozen
death threats since Christmas.

118
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,643
If you're asking for names,

119
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,645
we didn't make
a habit of filing the notes.

120
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,733
He was gonna give a speech today.
Did he have it on him?

121
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,303
Yes. Why?

122
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,978
There was
some secrecy surrounding it.

123
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,697
Do you know anything?

124
00:06:47,077 --> 00:06:48,227
No, I didn't.

125
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,454
That wasn't unusual.

126
00:06:55,334 --> 00:06:57,584
Hector rarely shared the details
of his work with me.

127
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,001
His way of protecting me.

128
00:07:01,277 --> 00:07:03,505
The person you need to talk to
is Russell Bigelow.

129
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:05,674
He did research for Hector.

130
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,306
You've been told
who I am and what I do?

131
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,517
My communication
with the other side is like

132
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:20,606
a long-distance phone call
with a bad connection.

133
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:23,777
So often the messages I receive
are meaningless to me,

134
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:27,072
but not to those with ones
who've passed over, okay?

135
00:07:27,729 --> 00:07:29,524
I'm really not big on this...

136
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,201
- supernatural stuff.
- You're not alone.

137
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,175
Your husband wants me
to remind you of something...

138
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,410
that will make you smile...

139
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,922
I'm getting an image of...

140
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:46,673
Cherry blossoms?

141
00:07:48,385 --> 00:07:49,885
Does that mean anything to you?

142
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,947
We were married under a cherry tree.

143
00:07:57,526 --> 00:07:58,811
How could you know that?

144
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,507
He can recall foliage
from his wedding day,

145
00:08:01,632 --> 00:08:04,023
but he can't tell you
who killed him?

146
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,038
Crossing over to the other side
can be confusing.

147
00:08:07,163 --> 00:08:08,971
It's a bit like waking up
from anesthesia.

148
00:08:09,096 --> 00:08:11,698
Sometimes it can take a while
to get real clarity.

149
00:08:13,874 --> 00:08:14,974
Makes sense.

150
00:08:16,955 --> 00:08:18,288
Carmen, mean anything to you?

151
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:20,608
The opera.

152
00:08:21,021 --> 00:08:21,834
Why?

153
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:25,351
That's pretty.

154
00:08:25,636 --> 00:08:26,636
My turn.

155
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:30,050
Did your husband ever cheat on you?

156
00:08:30,591 --> 00:08:32,141
Did you cheat on him?

157
00:08:32,754 --> 00:08:33,846
Why?

158
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:36,216
You're very noble and dignified.

159
00:08:36,341 --> 00:08:37,550
Very stoic.

160
00:08:38,206 --> 00:08:40,341
A Jackie o.
Thing going on there.

161
00:08:40,466 --> 00:08:43,021
Maybe you don't give a crap.
Maybe you're happy he's dead.

162
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:50,899
Maybe not.

163
00:08:52,805 --> 00:08:53,949
I'd like you to leave.

164
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,140
Good idea.
Jane, enough fun. Let's go.

165
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:02,541
Thank you for the tea.
Very tasty.

166
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:07,558
Nice work.

167
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,039
She was hiding something.
I wanted to see what.

168
00:09:10,164 --> 00:09:11,483
What'd you learn?

169
00:09:11,608 --> 00:09:14,007
- It's early days.
- She's got a good arm.

170
00:09:14,132 --> 00:09:15,382
Did learn that.

171
00:09:15,781 --> 00:09:18,918
I'm not so sure this is such a good idea
I talk about this stuff.

172
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,370
I'm just a researcher, you know?

173
00:09:22,084 --> 00:09:24,548
We understand that you're frightened,
but we really need

174
00:09:24,673 --> 00:09:27,149
- to know what was in that speech.
- You don't understand.

175
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:29,900
Trafficking generates billions.

176
00:09:30,621 --> 00:09:32,487
There are governments
behind this stuff.

177
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:35,574
It's like they can get to anybody.
Hector's death proves that.

178
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,992
We can protect you.

179
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,411
Only if you tell us.

180
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:42,372
If you don't help us,

181
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,833
then all the work that you've done
to stop these guys

182
00:09:45,145 --> 00:09:46,645
will be for nothing.

183
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:50,124
Traffickers use

184
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:53,388
quasi-legit businesses to launder
their money around the world.

185
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:55,725
I watch audit trails.

186
00:09:56,165 --> 00:09:57,715
We made a connection.

187
00:09:58,818 --> 00:10:00,599
That's what's in Hector's speech.

188
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,067
What connection?

189
00:10:03,866 --> 00:10:06,412
Have you ever heard of the world
anti-trafficking coalition?

190
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:10,067
- One of the backers of the conference?
- A major charity.

191
00:10:10,306 --> 00:10:12,319
It's run by a guy
named Christopher Lynch.

192
00:10:12,686 --> 00:10:14,905
They assisted us in shutting down
a bunch of networks,

193
00:10:15,614 --> 00:10:17,407
but the trafficking continued.

194
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,369
The money just went someplace else.

195
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:22,496
It took a while to trace it,
but we found out

196
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:25,374
the coalition is a front
for a trafficking group.

197
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,793
They used us

198
00:10:27,961 --> 00:10:31,090
to shut down their own competition,
building themselves a monopoly.

199
00:10:32,737 --> 00:10:33,610
Here.

200
00:10:33,735 --> 00:10:35,716
- That the speech?
- My copy.

201
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,008
Why didn't you
notify the authorities

202
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:41,510
- once you found what was going on?
- 'cause hector said

203
00:10:41,635 --> 00:10:44,109
that he wanted to denounce
Lynch himself, in public.

204
00:10:44,714 --> 00:10:48,327
I said it was too dangerous,
but he just wouldn't listen.

205
00:10:49,657 --> 00:10:52,216
Did Brava ever mention
anybody named Carmen to you?

206
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,000
No, not to me.

207
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:55,946
Why?

208
00:10:56,188 --> 00:10:57,970
Bigelow is saying that the people

209
00:10:58,095 --> 00:11:00,233
fighting human trafficking
were traffickers.

210
00:11:00,358 --> 00:11:03,108
- Apparently.
- All right. You and Cho talk to Lynch.

211
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:05,956
- See what he has to say.
- Okay, you got it.

212
00:11:09,694 --> 00:11:11,116
Are you guys joking?

213
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,552
Because your humor's in bad taste.

214
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,841
Hector was a colleague
and a good friend.

215
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,297
Who was planning to give
a speech that would identify

216
00:11:18,422 --> 00:11:20,554
your coalition as a front
for human traffickers.

217
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,475
He named you specifically.

218
00:11:23,384 --> 00:11:25,809
Someone is leading you down
the garden path, gentlemen.

219
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:28,483
There's no basis of truth in this.

220
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,731
You see that it's
in the traffickers' interest

221
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,483
to split us up,
get us suspecting each other.

222
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,129
- Brava went past suspecting you.
- Please.

223
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:38,071
Hector saw conspiracies everywhere.

224
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,586
- He liked being in the spotlight.
- We read the speech.

225
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:44,538
- It makes a pretty convincing case.
- We're gonna clear this up right now.

226
00:11:44,774 --> 00:11:48,165
I will have my lawyers, give you access
to all our records, and you'll see

227
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,208
that the coalition
has nothing to hide.

228
00:11:50,516 --> 00:11:53,003
Does the name "Carmen"
mean anything to you?

229
00:11:53,171 --> 00:11:55,627
Can you think of anybody
who'd want to kill Brava?

230
00:11:55,752 --> 00:11:57,852
Maybe only a few hundred people.

231
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:00,888
Wait a second.

232
00:12:01,371 --> 00:12:02,262
One thing.

233
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:04,747
Second night of the convention,

234
00:12:04,934 --> 00:12:08,040
I saw Hector having an argument
with a man named Tariq Sharif

235
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,953
outside the hotel bar,

236
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:13,398
and for my money,
the argument was about a woman.

237
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,458
- How you'd tell?
- I know these guys,

238
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,445
they definitely weren't having
a discussion about immigration policy.

239
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,467
How's it coming with Lynch?

240
00:12:21,592 --> 00:12:24,076
Says a man called Tariq Sharif
was fighting with Brava.

241
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,892
- Checking for an ID on Sharif.
- I took a look at the records

242
00:12:27,017 --> 00:12:29,089
that Lynch's lawyer emailed over.
First glance,

243
00:12:29,214 --> 00:12:31,176
couldn't find anything
on Brava's accusations.

244
00:12:31,301 --> 00:12:34,033
I checked Lynch's phone records.
He made a single call after we left

245
00:12:34,158 --> 00:12:35,796
to an anonymous disposable cell.

246
00:12:35,964 --> 00:12:37,797
- Origine?
- Here's the weird thing.

247
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,214
It ends at a cell tower
in the middle of nowhere.

248
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:41,720
- That is weird.
- Right?

249
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,804
- We figured we'd go check it out.
- Okay.

250
00:12:44,148 --> 00:12:45,639
Here we go. I got him.

251
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,974
Here's Tariq Sharif.

252
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:54,810
I'll see if anybody's seen Sharif.

253
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,648
Excuse me.

254
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:06,194
He's by the pool.

255
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,213
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

256
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:27,051
Mr. Sharif?

257
00:13:27,252 --> 00:13:28,252
Yes?

258
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:29,988
We're with the cbi.

259
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,272
Won't you sit down?

260
00:13:35,944 --> 00:13:37,732
Well, don't mind if we do.

261
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:42,737
I was just telling Mr. Sharif
that his spirit is troubled.

262
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,115
There's a wrong
that he burns to rectify.

263
00:13:46,074 --> 00:13:47,033
Interesting.

264
00:13:47,201 --> 00:13:50,078
Hector was an old friend.
I... pushed him

265
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,756
to take up the trafficking problem.
Naturally,

266
00:13:52,944 --> 00:13:54,394
I feel responsible.

267
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,544
They're great glasses.
Could I try those?

268
00:14:02,317 --> 00:14:04,146
Why don't you
take off the sunglasses?

269
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:06,485
Now.

270
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,494
You got a...

271
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,067
owie.

272
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:19,697
It was a misunderstanding.
He was drunk.

273
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,611
It didn't have anything to do
with Ilsa, by any chance?

274
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:24,932
It was nothing like that.

275
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,200
- It was exactly like that.
- You have

276
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,367
a strong connection with Ilsa...
A bond.

277
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,535
See?

278
00:14:33,044 --> 00:14:35,479
Ilsa and I were very close.

279
00:14:37,965 --> 00:14:41,046
By chance, we found ourselves
here alone on the first night.

280
00:14:42,462 --> 00:14:44,799
I expressed
my deep admiration for her.

281
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,511
She returned my feelings
but was afraid to act on it.

282
00:14:48,699 --> 00:14:49,868
Hector found out.

283
00:14:49,993 --> 00:14:52,371
Hypocrite that he is,
he attacked me.

284
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:55,886
- How is he a hypocrite?
- Because he was unfaithful to her.

285
00:14:56,907 --> 00:14:57,771
I did say.

286
00:14:58,510 --> 00:14:59,314
You did.

287
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,818
You were saying
that Mr. Brava was unfaithful?

288
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,651
I'm a pacifist, not a coward.

289
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:07,909
You don't strike me
without repercussions.

290
00:15:08,193 --> 00:15:11,087
I went to his suite
the night before he died

291
00:15:11,212 --> 00:15:12,494
to confront him.

292
00:15:13,993 --> 00:15:15,667
A woman was leaving.

293
00:15:19,254 --> 00:15:20,481
It wasn't Ilsa.

294
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,481
Was it someone from the conference?

295
00:15:24,606 --> 00:15:27,496
It wasn't that kind of woman.
She was young, pretty,

296
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,543
cheap clothes,
I assume she was a prostitute.

297
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:42,315
Far as I can tell,

298
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:46,126
it's the only structure in a half mile
of the tower Lynch's call stopped at.

299
00:15:46,251 --> 00:15:48,641
- I don't see anything.
- Nope. Not a thing.

300
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,831
- Think they have dogs?
- Probably.

301
00:16:55,075 --> 00:16:56,175
Hey, listen.

302
00:16:59,445 --> 00:17:00,445
There.

303
00:17:47,745 --> 00:17:49,755
You have misread
the situation, agents.

304
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,258
I am entirely ignorant
of whatever it is

305
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,783
- that you are accusing me of.
- You're lying.

306
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:56,491
We've got phone records.

307
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,994
You called your goons to lock those
women up so your guys could escape.

308
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,662
I'm sorry goons? What goons?
And records can be faked.

309
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:06,835
Those women in the truck, that was you.
Hector Brava... That was you, too.

310
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,536
You're wrong.

311
00:18:09,062 --> 00:18:10,964
I weep for those poor souls
you found.

312
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,334
And as I said,

313
00:18:12,849 --> 00:18:15,264
- Hector was a dear friend.
- What about Carmen?

314
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,225
Who's Carmen?

315
00:18:18,978 --> 00:18:20,098
Where's my lawyer?

316
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,331
Tough.

317
00:18:22,456 --> 00:18:23,456
Sociopath.

318
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:25,645
Wolf among the sheep.

319
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:27,819
He's a caught wolf now.

320
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:32,117
Phone call's enough to connect him
to 20 felony charges,

321
00:18:32,242 --> 00:18:34,023
not even counting the homicide.

322
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:36,030
He's going away for a long time.

323
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:45,540
She likes you, that one.

324
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,103
- Which one?
- The blonde one.

325
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,501
And you like her.

326
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:52,964
I'm not so sure
I know where this is headed.

327
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,574
You know it exactly.

328
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:57,093
Do you ever consider dating again?

329
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Do you?

330
00:19:01,026 --> 00:19:03,975
- How did we get to this point?
- I'm saying it would be a good thing.

331
00:19:04,896 --> 00:19:05,944
What would?

332
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:08,166
Charging Lynch with Brava's murder.

333
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,050
How close are we?

334
00:19:10,246 --> 00:19:13,818
- A confession would help.
- Why don't you ask one of her spirits?

335
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,488
I'm sure they'll provide
the evidence that's needed.

336
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:17,781
Where do you go?

337
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,867
This case is solving itself
without me. I have errands to run.

338
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,045
Christopher Lynch didn't kill Brava.

339
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,491
The emotion he was trying
to conceal was contempt.

340
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,928
Lynch didn't consider him
worth killing.

341
00:19:40,815 --> 00:19:44,165
A deeply evil man,
but not one who committed this crime.

342
00:19:57,037 --> 00:19:59,456
What if I didn't say "spirits"?
If I said "instincts"?

343
00:19:59,581 --> 00:20:01,677
Would that be something
you could accept?

344
00:20:01,802 --> 00:20:02,902
Well, maybe.

345
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:05,495
- They're telling me to come with you.
- Are they? Why?

346
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:07,530
The last time you spoke
with Ilsa Engels,

347
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:09,163
- she threw a teacup.
- A saucer.

348
00:20:09,288 --> 00:20:11,167
Not a teacup.
Who said I go to see Ilsa Engels?

349
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,989
Tell me that you're not.

350
00:20:15,207 --> 00:20:18,022
She thinks well of me.
I can communicate with her husband.

351
00:20:18,575 --> 00:20:20,792
And she'll only talk to you
if I'm there.

352
00:20:21,371 --> 00:20:23,763
I guess I have no choice
but to bring you along with me.

353
00:20:25,187 --> 00:20:27,517
You think you manipulated me
into coming with you?

354
00:20:27,686 --> 00:20:29,929
No, I don't. I think
you manipulated me into thinking

355
00:20:30,054 --> 00:20:31,855
I manipulated you
into coming with me.

356
00:20:39,804 --> 00:20:42,449
Okay, I'm just gonna come
straight out, and I'm gonna say

357
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,746
i'm sorry for the, obnoxious
infidelity remarks earlier,

358
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,137
and I humbly beg your forgiveness.

359
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:51,875
Sorry.

360
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:55,503
Would you mind talking to us
a little bit about Tariq Sharif?

361
00:20:57,198 --> 00:20:59,936
He was drunk. He said things
he shouldn't have said,

362
00:21:00,061 --> 00:21:02,468
and I excused myself
from his company.

363
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:04,262
And then your husband punched him.

364
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:07,098
I didn't tell to hit him,
if that's what you're asking.

365
00:21:10,114 --> 00:21:12,186
I won't pretend
I'm particularly sad that

366
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,475
Hector punched him.

367
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:15,398
He said things that...

368
00:21:17,732 --> 00:21:19,569
He acted like a pig and an ass.

369
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:22,085
A pig and an ass?
That can't be good.

370
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:28,761
We need to ask you again
about the night before hector died.

371
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:36,461
I had a department meeting.
I stayed

372
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,095
up in berkeley.

373
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:39,881
And,

374
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:42,073
is there any chance
that a woman could've been

375
00:21:42,198 --> 00:21:43,718
visiting with Hector that night?

376
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,073
If Tariq said that, he's lying.

377
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,394
He wouldn't dare say that if Hector
was still alive.

378
00:21:50,591 --> 00:21:51,643
It's disgusting.

379
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:53,406
Disgusting.

380
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,826
I guess I should go.

381
00:22:02,425 --> 00:22:05,627
Okay. I still have some business
to attend to here, so...

382
00:22:06,723 --> 00:22:08,451
Yes, I'm gonna catch a cab
out front.

383
00:22:13,656 --> 00:22:15,959
Nice call on the cherry blossoms,
by the way.

384
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:17,335
How so?

385
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,065
The wedding photograph...

386
00:22:19,347 --> 00:22:20,630
March '97, DC.

387
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,200
March through to April is the annual
cherry blossom festival in DC.

388
00:22:27,564 --> 00:22:30,144
Patrick, you credit me with far
too much cunning.

389
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:32,725
You're very good.
Very compelling.

390
00:22:33,184 --> 00:22:34,184
Thank you.

391
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:38,231
I'll see you later.

392
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,643
Meet me at the hotel bar.

393
00:22:51,129 --> 00:22:53,162
Sweetheart, there you are. Join us.

394
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:54,908
I've got us a room,

395
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:57,441
- And our friend here...
- Novella.

396
00:22:58,462 --> 00:22:59,494
Novella.

397
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:02,171
She's gonna help us
explore some boundaries.

398
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:04,048
No, she's not.

399
00:23:06,108 --> 00:23:07,621
Work with me, Teresa.

400
00:23:16,316 --> 00:23:17,688
You're pretty, well,

401
00:23:17,993 --> 00:23:19,564
You're pretty adventurous, right?

402
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,031
Because my lady, she...

403
00:23:21,477 --> 00:23:23,213
she gets a little out there
at times.

404
00:23:23,494 --> 00:23:24,652
Gettin' there now.

405
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:26,434
Let's go upstairs and see.

406
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,977
You just have to work things out
with Howie.

407
00:23:31,181 --> 00:23:32,035
Barkeep!

408
00:23:32,672 --> 00:23:35,180
How can I help you?
Another bottle of the good stuff?

409
00:23:36,224 --> 00:23:38,417
No, thanks...
You're the pimp?

410
00:23:40,353 --> 00:23:42,781
- Not nice.
- Well, business manager, then.

411
00:23:43,769 --> 00:23:44,881
Concerned friend.

412
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:47,592
Whatever. We'd like to take
our little soirée upstairs

413
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,052
to a more private location.

414
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,220
Novella says that we have
to talk to you.

415
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,809
If it's gonna be the two of you,
it's gonna be extra.

416
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,232
Sure. She's paying.

417
00:24:05,954 --> 00:24:08,487
I should probably tell you
that I am Agent

418
00:24:08,612 --> 00:24:10,615
for the California bureau
of investigation.

419
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:13,785
She has a gun, too. And handcuffs.

420
00:24:14,523 --> 00:24:16,881
- This is entrapment. I want a lawyer.
- What you want

421
00:24:17,006 --> 00:24:19,999
is to take a look at this picture
and tell me if you recognize this man.

422
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:22,585
Nope. Never seen him.

423
00:24:25,859 --> 00:24:28,100
But that guy...
Him I recognize.

424
00:24:28,886 --> 00:24:31,079
He was in here getting a girl
just the other night.

425
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,569
No. No way.

426
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,410
I might not be Denzel,
but I do okay.

427
00:24:36,797 --> 00:24:39,060
Besides, I couldn't afford a prostitute
on my salary.

428
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:40,598
Not for you.

429
00:24:40,723 --> 00:24:42,230
For your boss, Brava.

430
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,679
Is that something you did
a lot of...

431
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,442
Procuring women for him?

432
00:24:50,402 --> 00:24:51,493
The man's dead.

433
00:24:53,089 --> 00:24:55,451
Are you seriously gonna drag his name
through the mud?

434
00:24:55,778 --> 00:24:58,112
I'm not looking
to destroy anybody's reputation.

435
00:24:58,237 --> 00:25:00,039
I just need to know what happened.

436
00:25:02,288 --> 00:25:03,793
Ilsa was back in Berkeley.

437
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:06,791
He called me

438
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:09,231
and said he needed me
to do him a favor.

439
00:25:10,533 --> 00:25:14,029
He couldn't go down to the bar himself,
because somebody would recognize him.

440
00:25:14,556 --> 00:25:16,222
Somebody could've recognized you.

441
00:25:16,512 --> 00:25:17,639
Nobody did.

442
00:25:18,436 --> 00:25:19,436
I was lucky.

443
00:25:20,032 --> 00:25:21,185
It was hard for you.

444
00:25:22,858 --> 00:25:23,858
Sure.

445
00:25:24,935 --> 00:25:27,844
Sure, it would've been easier
if he didn't do it at all, but...

446
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,659
all I could do was

447
00:25:31,122 --> 00:25:32,987
just keep him from getting caught.

448
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:36,002
Is there anything you can tell us
about the girl?

449
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:39,732
I think her name was...

450
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:42,638
Claret.

451
00:25:42,835 --> 00:25:43,844
It's French.

452
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:50,589
What did Brava mean when he said
he wanted to make it regular?

453
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,177
Not, like, actually regular,
because he died and all,

454
00:25:55,558 --> 00:25:57,693
but every thursday afternoon,
it was gonna be.

455
00:25:58,173 --> 00:26:00,892
- He had a place up in Oakland.
- Do you have an address?

456
00:26:01,614 --> 00:26:02,614
Sure.

457
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:03,948
And a key, too.

458
00:26:05,743 --> 00:26:07,702
I think it's this one on the left.

459
00:26:22,224 --> 00:26:23,784
So would you ever...

460
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:25,666
You know...

461
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:27,632
Pay for sex? No.

462
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,462
It's weird, right?

463
00:26:30,415 --> 00:26:32,015
Weird? No.
Expensive.

464
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:38,135
Check this out.

465
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:43,351
Bingo.

466
00:26:44,284 --> 00:26:46,896
- What do you got?
- Ce tracked Carmen's phone number.

467
00:26:47,183 --> 00:26:49,398
It's an apartment rented
to a Sally Alvarez.

468
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,567
So "Carmen" was just a name
she used for work?

469
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:53,402
She has been picked up
for soliciting,

470
00:26:53,666 --> 00:26:56,280
once for possession. She skipped on
that apartment about a month ago,

471
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:59,283
but her P.O. gave us an address
that was good as of last week.

472
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:02,036
Call Burnside.
Tell him we're gonna pick her up.

473
00:27:02,204 --> 00:27:04,956
There was a Carmen Reyes
who called Brava on his hotel phone

474
00:27:05,124 --> 00:27:06,690
twice the night before he died.

475
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:08,471
Left her name
on the hotel messaging.

476
00:27:08,596 --> 00:27:11,545
No record of Sally Alvarez
calling the hotel. Home or cell.

477
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,923
Where did the call originate from?

478
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:16,384
Sunset Horizon Motor court
in San Desidera.

479
00:27:16,552 --> 00:27:18,928
A Carmen Reyes checked in two days ago.
She's still there.

480
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,055
We've got two locations
to look for her at.

481
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:22,682
Or we have two Carmen.

482
00:27:23,190 --> 00:27:24,100
Two Carmen?

483
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:29,480
- What does that mean?
- Means things are getting interesting.

484
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,607
As long as it's interesting for you.

485
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,212
I'll go with Van Pelt.

486
00:27:37,466 --> 00:27:39,558
There's just something about motels.

487
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:41,784
Old-fashioned and illicit,

488
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,552
both at the same time.

489
00:27:44,447 --> 00:27:45,875
Is that an invitation?

490
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:49,458
Look at you, just showing up
like a bad penny.

491
00:27:50,224 --> 00:27:51,961
I had a premonition you'd be here.

492
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:53,481
Really?

493
00:27:54,161 --> 00:27:55,611
No.
Lisbon told me.

494
00:27:57,551 --> 00:27:58,759
Upstairs. 204.

495
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,640
You know Kristina?

496
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,557
Did your psychic powers
tell you to come?

497
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:08,102
I did have an instinct you were
about to get a break in this case.

498
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,950
I think you might have just made
agent Van Pelt's day.

499
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:12,644
We're looking for Carmen Reyes.

500
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:15,327
We have two addresses for her.
This is just one of 'em.

501
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:18,070
- Her real name is Sally Alvarez.
- Wait a second.

502
00:28:19,127 --> 00:28:20,214
I know that name.

503
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:23,034
She communicated with me.
She's passed over.

504
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,289
I'm pretty sure
she's still in there.

505
00:28:33,147 --> 00:28:34,197
Open it up.

506
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:37,262
Step back, sir.

507
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:42,645
She's down.

508
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:50,186
We found Sally Alvarez.

509
00:28:50,627 --> 00:28:53,147
She's been dead for about six hours.
Blunt force trauma to the head.

510
00:28:53,315 --> 00:28:56,317
She's dead? My god.
That's amazing.

511
00:28:56,612 --> 00:28:58,402
- Why?
- Kristina Frye

512
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,404
said Sally passed over.
She predicted it.

513
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,572
- She did?
- Can I have that?

514
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:05,755
Please do not believe
this mystic mumbo jumbo.

515
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,204
Gullible Grace buried the lead.
I was right.

516
00:29:08,697 --> 00:29:10,706
- There were two Carmen.
- There were?

517
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,219
That's right,
and we have the real one right here.

518
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,494
Carmen Reyes.

519
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,215
She claims to be
Hector Brava's daughter.

520
00:29:23,046 --> 00:29:25,805
A year ago,
my mother's diagnosed with cancer.

521
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,082
It got bad very fast.

522
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:31,435
She was gone in less than a month.

523
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:35,064
Before she died, she told me
Hector Brava was my father.

524
00:29:35,948 --> 00:29:38,313
And after the funeral,
I wrote to him.

525
00:29:39,532 --> 00:29:40,653
I never heard back.

526
00:29:41,479 --> 00:29:42,479
I thought

527
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,558
maybe he'd forgotten her.

528
00:29:45,484 --> 00:29:47,720
I wrote there was nothing
I wanted from him,

529
00:29:48,001 --> 00:29:49,787
only to meet the man
who was my father.

530
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,247
He still didn't answer?

531
00:29:53,612 --> 00:29:56,127
I saw somewhere
that he was delivering a speech here.

532
00:29:58,321 --> 00:29:59,964
I thought i'd go confront him.

533
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:01,674
You were angry.

534
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,301
- I wanted to talk to him.
- Did you?

535
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:07,430
When?

536
00:30:07,898 --> 00:30:08,973
The morning he died?

537
00:30:10,047 --> 00:30:11,359
The night before.

538
00:30:12,592 --> 00:30:13,936
I went to his suite.

539
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,271
And?

540
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,107
He let me in.

541
00:30:19,883 --> 00:30:21,117
He was friendly,

542
00:30:22,242 --> 00:30:24,442
until I told him I s his daughter.

543
00:30:25,523 --> 00:30:26,523
He got

544
00:30:26,987 --> 00:30:29,258
very upset and angry.

545
00:30:31,242 --> 00:30:33,289
He said,
I could not be his daughter.

546
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,499
He said,
he already met his daughter,

547
00:30:35,709 --> 00:30:37,710
and what kind of scam
was I trying to play?

548
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,255
He turned so pale and shook

549
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:42,482
all over.

550
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,301
He threw me out of the room
and locked the door,

551
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:48,669
so I left.

552
00:30:52,599 --> 00:30:54,101
That was last time you saw him?

553
00:30:56,624 --> 00:30:58,650
On the news, it said what happened.

554
00:31:01,051 --> 00:31:02,485
I didn't know what to do.

555
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:05,946
And what about the text message?
Did you send that?

556
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:08,803
I don't have a phone.

557
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:11,327
So is she telling the truth?

558
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,990
I'm not sure.

559
00:31:13,426 --> 00:31:14,997
Brava's spirit is deeply conflicted.

560
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,749
I can't get a clear reading.

561
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,667
What are you using, dial-up?

562
00:31:20,504 --> 00:31:21,504
My question,

563
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,923
is if she's telling the truth,
why was Sally Alvarez

564
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:25,859
pretending to be Carmen Reyes?

565
00:31:26,234 --> 00:31:28,511
I talked to Bigelow.
He kept a record of all work

566
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,514
correspondences but didn't have anything
to do with Brava's personal letters.

567
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,516
No way to know
if she tell the truth.

568
00:31:33,684 --> 00:31:35,476
If Brava's her father,
she's got motive.

569
00:31:35,644 --> 00:31:36,886
She's not the only one.

570
00:31:40,884 --> 00:31:42,737
I could never have children.

571
00:31:45,903 --> 00:31:46,904
Is it true?

572
00:31:47,552 --> 00:31:48,989
Is she really she's daughter?

573
00:31:49,663 --> 00:31:50,908
We don't know, Ma'am.

574
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:52,868
She's agreed to take
a paternity test.

575
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:54,620
She might be telling the truth.

576
00:31:55,143 --> 00:31:57,122
You think she might be the one
that killed hector.

577
00:31:57,395 --> 00:31:59,792
Maybe...
And then maybe it was you.

578
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,829
I have to say, Ma'am,

579
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:05,047
it's pretty hard to believe
that you didn't know about his behavior.

580
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:06,757
I knew.

581
00:32:07,745 --> 00:32:09,927
Hector was a passionate
and heroic man who devoted

582
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,554
himself to helping others.

583
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,223
His flaws
were correspondingly oversized.

584
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:16,413
And his behavior was okay with you?

585
00:32:17,082 --> 00:32:18,349
I accepted it.

586
00:32:19,193 --> 00:32:21,023
The good in him outweighed the bad.

587
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:25,799
If he'd told me, maybe
I could've done something to prevent it.

588
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:29,780
- Maybe I could've saved him.
- What for?

589
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:33,260
How could you not want to get away
from his serial philandering,

590
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,366
from the prison
of your loveless marriage?

591
00:32:35,491 --> 00:32:36,620
That's not true!

592
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:37,871
I loved my husband,

593
00:32:38,219 --> 00:32:39,331
and he loved me!

594
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,250
Maybe we can get in contact
with him now.

595
00:32:42,068 --> 00:32:43,616
You could do that, couldn't you?

596
00:32:43,741 --> 00:32:45,763
It would certainly clear up
a few things.

597
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:49,008
Would you do that?

598
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:51,093
Would you talk to my husband?

599
00:32:51,465 --> 00:32:52,469
Yes, ilsa.

600
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,097
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

601
00:32:57,062 --> 00:32:59,490
Okay, so Van Pelt
is bringing Carmen.

602
00:32:59,615 --> 00:33:01,719
Rigsby's gonna bring
Richard Bigelow.

603
00:33:01,844 --> 00:33:03,652
Cho is gonna pick up Tariq Sharif

604
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:05,816
and Stacey.
So we're all set.

605
00:33:06,127 --> 00:33:08,428
- What's all set for what?
- We're all set for,

606
00:33:08,553 --> 00:33:11,313
Kristina Frye
to contact Hector Brava's spirit.

607
00:33:11,438 --> 00:33:13,449
I need everybody connected
with his passing.

608
00:33:14,814 --> 00:33:16,160
Well, I guess...

609
00:33:16,855 --> 00:33:19,208
Just make sure Brava's spirit
has a thirst for revenge.

610
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,531
He wants to put some kind
of a curse on the killer, okay?

611
00:33:21,656 --> 00:33:23,793
That kind of thing.
And I'll take it from there.

612
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:25,210
I can't do that.

613
00:33:25,754 --> 00:33:28,464
Yes, you can. It is a necessary lie.

614
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,949
I can only contact hector Brava's spirit
and speak as he wants me to.

615
00:33:32,074 --> 00:33:34,225
To do otherwise
would be to abuse my gift.

616
00:33:40,595 --> 00:33:43,105
- Everything okay?
- Yep. Everything's good. It's perfect.

617
00:33:46,967 --> 00:33:48,223
Are we starting now?

618
00:33:48,348 --> 00:33:50,486
- Almost.
- I'll just get the door.

619
00:33:51,847 --> 00:33:52,847
Welcome.

620
00:33:53,923 --> 00:33:54,967
Come on in.

621
00:33:57,411 --> 00:33:58,452
Thanks for coming.

622
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,080
It was your husband's request.

623
00:34:04,145 --> 00:34:05,447
Your husband's daughter.

624
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:19,409
Thank you all for coming.

625
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:21,731
Patrick will be assisting me.

626
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,771
So in order for this to work,
I need everybody to be calm and focused.

627
00:34:26,945 --> 00:34:29,420
I want you to look at the candle
in the center of the table.

628
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,402
Focus on the flame

629
00:34:31,742 --> 00:34:33,255
and concentrate on Hector.

630
00:34:52,665 --> 00:34:53,674
He's here.

631
00:34:56,808 --> 00:34:57,876
I can feel him.

632
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,477
Who do you wish to speak to?

633
00:35:10,912 --> 00:35:12,025
The killer's here.

634
00:35:16,777 --> 00:35:17,844
Know this...

635
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,637
Hector Brava says...

636
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,655
vengeance will come.

637
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,104
Your blood will spill...

638
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,039
Before the rising sun.

639
00:35:31,518 --> 00:35:32,703
I sense him.

640
00:35:36,961 --> 00:35:38,755
I can almost see an image.

641
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,104
It's hazy.

642
00:35:46,562 --> 00:35:47,958
It's as if it could just...

643
00:35:48,083 --> 00:35:50,198
Hector, wait.
Stop. Don't go.

644
00:35:51,418 --> 00:35:53,066
Show us who the killer is.

645
00:35:53,925 --> 00:35:55,051
There it is.

646
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:57,236
A door.

647
00:35:58,666 --> 00:36:00,050
"Employees only."

648
00:36:02,173 --> 00:36:03,604
And an empty hallway.

649
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,677
Footsteps...

650
00:36:07,721 --> 00:36:08,730
Close...

651
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:11,158
Close...

652
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,380
I see you.

653
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:20,719
I'm sorry.
You scared me to death with that.

654
00:36:21,769 --> 00:36:23,806
It's okay. You can relax, Bigelow.
It's over.

655
00:36:25,223 --> 00:36:26,600
I know it was you that did it.

656
00:36:26,873 --> 00:36:28,685
Because I got frantic
and I'm fell out?

657
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,647
Because you managed Brava's
correspondence, you were the first one

658
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:33,273
to read Carmen's letters, yes?

659
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,442
You set Brava up
on a date with sally

660
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,028
and had her pretend to be Carmen,
and then you told Brava

661
00:36:38,153 --> 00:36:39,822
that he had sex with his daughter.

662
00:36:40,145 --> 00:36:40,948
Lord.

663
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,909
And then the real deal showed up,

664
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,578
you faked Carmen's message,

665
00:36:47,325 --> 00:36:50,332
and when Brava walked through
that service door, you killed him.

666
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,334
And you killed poor Sally Alvarez

667
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,884
to cover your tracks.

668
00:36:55,033 --> 00:36:57,130
And now you'll pay
for the crime you committed.

669
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,926
Your blood will spill
before the sun rises.

670
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,636
That part I'm not so sure about.

671
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,412
It came in the mail.

672
00:37:13,409 --> 00:37:15,004
Just out of the blue.
Just a...

673
00:37:16,343 --> 00:37:19,392
Letter describing
an affair Brava had 20 years ago,

674
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:21,903
naming the woman and the place.

675
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:24,157
And that came from Carmen Reyes.
The real Carmen.

676
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,111
That gave you all
the facts you needed...

677
00:37:28,236 --> 00:37:31,313
Things about the affair that only Brava
and Carmen's mother would know.

678
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,190
- Right?
- Yeah.

679
00:37:42,259 --> 00:37:43,427
So why'd you do it?

680
00:37:45,203 --> 00:37:47,264
Why put a man through that kind
of suffering?

681
00:37:49,338 --> 00:37:52,165
Was it the money? Or did you just like
having Brava in your power?

682
00:37:54,841 --> 00:37:57,949
Do you know I've been running numbers
on trafficking for Brava

683
00:37:58,207 --> 00:38:01,105
and setting him up on his dates for,
like, five years?

684
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,914
And do you think that he ever,

685
00:38:05,310 --> 00:38:06,617
ever thanked me?

686
00:38:07,327 --> 00:38:08,594
Said, "I'm sorry"?

687
00:38:09,405 --> 00:38:12,009
Said, "I'm gonna make this up
to you one day, Russell"?

688
00:38:14,273 --> 00:38:15,305
I knew Sally

689
00:38:15,868 --> 00:38:17,182
from a whorehouse

690
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:19,004
up in Northern California.

691
00:38:19,515 --> 00:38:21,614
I told her if
she pretended to be Carmen,

692
00:38:21,896 --> 00:38:24,217
we could blackmail Brava
and split the money.

693
00:38:24,488 --> 00:38:26,486
The letter just gave us
everything we needed

694
00:38:26,611 --> 00:38:28,931
to make Brava think that
she was the real deal.

695
00:38:29,913 --> 00:38:32,953
And he was not one for asking
a whole lot of questions, so...

696
00:38:36,589 --> 00:38:38,960
- Then the real Carmen showed up.
- Yeah.

697
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,810
He called me
as soon as she left his room,

698
00:38:42,561 --> 00:38:43,570
freaked.

699
00:38:44,743 --> 00:38:45,812
So I played dumb.

700
00:38:46,029 --> 00:38:46,823
But then

701
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,709
the next morning, he called me

702
00:38:49,061 --> 00:38:50,577
and he said, "we need to talk."

703
00:38:51,092 --> 00:38:53,919
- It was pretty clear he figured it out.
- And so you went to the hotel

704
00:38:54,044 --> 00:38:56,007
and texted Brava
from the service hallway.

705
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,441
I just wanted to keep him quiet.

706
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,813
And Sally Alvarez?

707
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:24,903
You had to keep her quiet,
too, right?

708
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,732
I was a really good researcher.

709
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:32,744
I bet.

710
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:45,817
Agent Van Pelt,
you wanted to see me?

711
00:39:46,617 --> 00:39:49,764
Yeah. I just wanted to go over
a few things in your statement.

712
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,579
Let's go in the kitchen.

713
00:40:03,083 --> 00:40:04,443
Nice working with you.

714
00:40:07,682 --> 00:40:10,298
You were very good back there.
You almost had me with the whole

715
00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:13,493
"I can't misuse my gift for fear
of what might happen" bit.

716
00:40:13,922 --> 00:40:15,342
I did what I said I would.

717
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:19,191
I spoke the words the spirits
told me to speak, nothing more.

718
00:40:19,695 --> 00:40:20,695
Really?

719
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,064
Don't you know me by now?

720
00:40:24,534 --> 00:40:26,840
Don't you know I wouldn't lie
about a thing like that?

721
00:40:27,502 --> 00:40:28,300
Ms. Frye,

722
00:40:28,828 --> 00:40:31,470
Thank you. We couldn't have closed
this one without you.

723
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:32,846
That's debatable.

724
00:40:34,305 --> 00:40:35,265
You're welcome.

725
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,969
Although I have to say it looks like
the spirits got it wrong.

726
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:41,313
I guess being dead
doesn't make you infallible.

727
00:40:41,714 --> 00:40:42,903
What do you mean?

728
00:40:43,028 --> 00:40:45,317
The killer was caught,
and justice was served.

729
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,968
Sure. But no blood was spilled.
Look,

730
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,411
he's right there.

731
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:51,948
- Murderer!
- Easy!

732
00:41:02,408 --> 00:41:03,509
Come on.

733
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,481
That was pure luck.

734
00:41:10,244 --> 00:41:11,147
Admit it.

735
00:41:11,272 --> 00:41:13,444
- If you say so.
- I know so.

736
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:15,731
The dead are dead.

737
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,474
You can't talk to them.

738
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,746
And yet I do.

739
00:41:23,923 --> 00:41:25,037
You're vergood.

740
00:41:27,266 --> 00:41:28,819
- I go this way.
- Okay.

741
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,713
- It was nice seeing you again.
- You, too.

742
00:41:38,423 --> 00:41:39,746
That's with a "K," right?

743
00:41:43,527 --> 00:41:44,793
You wanna go get a coffee?

744
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:49,191
I'll drink tea myself, but you can drink
as much coffee as you want.

745
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,798
Yeah, I'd like that.

746
00:41:51,549 --> 00:41:54,352
I can't right now, though.
I have to be somewhere else.

747
00:41:55,091 --> 00:41:56,536
Maybe some other time?

748
00:41:57,053 --> 00:41:58,181
Some other time.

749
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,500
Sorry, not "maybe."

750
00:41:59,625 --> 00:42:01,518
Definitely.
Sometime soon.

751
00:42:03,113 --> 00:42:04,113
Call me.
