00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:04,400
DO YOU KNOW THE SPEECH?

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:05,400
I KNOW THE GIST OF IT.

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,900
YOU MEMORIZE ENTIRE HOMILIES.

5
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:08,300
HOMILIES ARE POETRY.

6
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,400
A PLEA BEFORE THE CITY COUNCIL IS DEMEANING.

7
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,700
ESTEEMED COUNCILMEN,

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,400

CHURCH WILL BE TORN DOWN.

WHICH YOU HAVE NEVER SHOWN BEFORE.

13
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,700
TO BLOCK THE SALE OF THE CHURCH.

14
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,500
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST LOSING A BUILDING,

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,900
WE'RE LOSING A SACRAMENT.

16
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:37,100
THE COMMUNION WITH OUR NEIGHBORS IS OUR MASS.

17
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,600
NOT BAD, HUH?

18
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,100

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,300

HEY. SOPHIE'S HERE.
MAN, WHAT DO I TELL HER?

26
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,600
ANYTHING BUT THE TRUTH.

27
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,000
- HEY.
- HEY!

28
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,500
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR
COMING TO MY PLAY LAST NIGHT.

29
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,600
LAST NIGHT WAS AWESOME.

30
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,300
THANKS, PARKER.

31
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,200
YEAH, IT WAS LIKE A HORROR MOVIE.

32
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:24,200
"ATTENTION MUST BE PAID!"

33
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:26,500
OH.

34
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,200
YEAH, I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON

35
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,800
I WOULD THINK OF TO PLAY WILLY LOMAN,

36
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,400
BUT YOU -- YOU WORKED IT OUT.

37
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,100
Yeah.

38
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,100
OH!

39
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,900
THAT WAS THE WORST NIGHT OF MY LIFE.

40
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,400
COME ON, MAN, YOU'VE BEEN IN WORSE SITUATIONS.

41
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,500
HA HA HA!

42
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,800
NO. NO, THAT WAS THE WORST.

43
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,200
MM!

44
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,500
HOW GREAT WERE YOU?

45
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,700
I MEAN, THEY OUGHT TO CALL IT,

46
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,400
UH, "DEATH OF A SALESWOMAN."

47
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:11,100
WHAT A GREAT COMMENTARY ON THE GLASS
CEILING FOR WOMEN IN CORPORATE AMERICA.

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,900
NATE, I-I PLAYED THE PART AS A MAN.

49
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,900
YES.

50
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,600
AND BRILLIANTLY.

51
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,400

00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,100

00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,800
OH.

55
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,900
HI. MAGGIE?

56
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,200
is everything okay?

57
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,200
WHO'S MAGGIE?

58
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,900
NATE'S EX-WIFE.

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,700
HEY.

60
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,800
IF I THOUGHT I'D GETYOUTO VISIT,

61
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,200
I'D HAVE GOTTEN MY RIBS
KICKED IN A LITTLE SOONER.

62
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,900
HOW YOU DOIN', PAUL?

63
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,200
I GOT MY SHOTS IN.

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,600
I POPPED THE FIRST GUY IN THE
SHOULDER BEFORE I BLACKED OUT.

65
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,800
YEAH. I KNOW.

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,100
I -- I READ THE POLICE REPORT.

67
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,500
YOU READ THE POLICE REPORT?

68
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,600
I DO THAT.

69
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,300
YOU TALK TO MAGGIE?

70
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,400
DO YOU THINK IT WAS A COINCIDENCE

71
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,300
THAT YOU GOT ATTACKED ON YOUR WAY TO BEG
THE CITY COUNCIL TO SAVE YOUR CHURCH?

72
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,500
NO, I DON'T.

73
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,900
YOU TALK TO MAGGIE A LOT?

74
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,500
yeah, WHEN IS THE SALE FINAL...

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
ON THE CHURCH?

76
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,900
ESCROW CLOSES MONDAY. WHY?

77
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,800
CODE BLUE. PEDIATRICS.

78
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,600
CODE BLUE.

79
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,700
I KNOW HOSPITALS ARE TOUGH FOR YOU.

80
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,200
PAUL, HAVE YOU TRIED LEGAL ACTION?

81
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,600
I MEAN, MAYBE AN INJUNCTION --

82
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,600
WITH WHAT MONEY?

83
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,700
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOD'S PLAN FOR
ME TO SAVE THE CHURCH, NATE.

84
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,000
I WAS WRONG.

85
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,200
BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE
ONE LAST MASS ON SUNDAY,

86
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,900
AND I PLAN TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT.

87
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,200
YOU SHOULD BE THERE.

88
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,900
IT'S NOT GONNA BE YOUR LAST MASS, PAUL.

89
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,300
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

90
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,200
NATE?

91
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,500
JUST...

92
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,200
MOVE GOD'S...

93
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,500
plans along.

94
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,100
THAT'S ST. NICHOLAS?

95
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:15,900
YES.

96
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,400
SANTA CLAUS HAS A CHURCH?

97
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,800
HE'S NOT SANTA CLAUS.

98
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,900
I KNOW THIS IS NOT OUR USUAL KIND OF CASE.

99
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,800
I REALI-- BUT BEFORE YOU SAY ANYTHING,

100
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
PAUL IS AN OLD FRIEND OF MINE,

101
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
AND HE HAS HELPED THE POOR PARISHES --

102
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,600
- NATE. NATE, NATE.
- MORE THAN YOU COULD EVER --

103
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,500
WE'RE TAKING THE CASE.

104
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
- OH.
- YEAH.

105
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
OH. GREAT. GOOD. OH.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,900
ALL RIGHT.

107
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,900
WELL, UH, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
A STRONG-ARM MANEUVER

108
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,700
THAT'S HAPPENED HERE --

109
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,300
GET RID OF THE ACTIVIST PRIEST

110
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,200
AND THE SALE CLOSES ON MONDAY.

111
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,900
DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT
WHO BOUGHT THE CHURCH?

112
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,800
THE SIGN OUTSIDE SAID
IT WAS SOLD TO CANNITY CORP.

113
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,700
NOW, CANNITY CORP IS A WHOLLY OWNED
SUBSIDIARY OF STB INTERNATIONAL,

114
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:56,400
WHICH IS A PARENT COMPANY OF AKAI DIVERSIFIED,

115
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,600
WHICH IS THE U.S. SUBSIDIARY OF CANNITY CORP.

116
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,300
THAT IS A LOT OF TROUBLE TO
GO TO FOR BUYING AN OLD CHURCH.

117
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,500
YEAH, SO, CANNITY CORP --
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE FRONT.

118
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,700
PARKER, CHECK ALL THE ADDRESSES
FOR THE REALTY COMPANIES.

119
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,700
ELIOT, HARDISON -- FIND THE
LOCAL TALENT THAT ATTACKED PAUL.

120
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:12,200
UM, HE MESSED UP ONE OF
THEIR SHOULDERS, IF THAT HELPS.

121
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,100
- SO...
- NO, NO.

122
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,800
- LET'S GO, COME ON.
- I DON'T DO GANGS.

123
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,700
COME ON. WE GOT SOME FRESH AIR.

124
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,700
GET OFF THE COMPUTER.

125
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,500
- I RAPPEL.
- COME ON!

126
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,300
DID NO ONE SEE ME RAPPEL?

127
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:23,800
OH, I HEARD ABOUT IT.

128
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,000
YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

129
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,900
HE'S AN OLD FRIEND.

130
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,700
I OWE HIM.

131
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:04,600
YOU THINK THAT WE JUST GONNA
WALK INTO SOME RANDOM TUNNEL

132
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,000
AND FIND SOME CHOLOS JUST ALL YOKED UP?

133
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,700
- YOU KNOW?
- HARDISON --

134
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,600
"YO, HOLMES, LET ME FIX..."

135
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,300
- DUDE,
- ???QUIET.

136
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,100
LISTEN.

137
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,500
BOYS. WE DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE.

138
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
ALL RIGHT? WE JUST WANT SOME ANSWERS.

139
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,700
HOW'S THIS ANSWER?

140
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,800
GENTLEMEN...

141
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,100
I'M ASKING ON ONE OF YOUR COLLEAGUES,

142
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,000
SOMEBODY WHO ROLLED A PRIEST.

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,900
WHO WAS IT?

144
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,900
YOU SEEING THIS, HARDISON?

145
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,400
THE--THE SITUATION HAS MY ATTENTION, YES.

146
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,100
YOU SEE, THAT'S WHY I DON'T LIKE GUNS.

147
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,700
THEY HAVE A SPECIFIC RANGE OF EFFICACY.

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,700
SEE, MOST GUYS MAKE ONE MISTAKE.

149
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,300
THEY GET TOO CLOSE.

150
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,000
WHO ROLLED...A PRIEST?

151
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
WE DIDN'T BEAT UP NO PRIEST.

152
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,700
WE ARE NOT ???.

153
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,400
DISLOCATED SHOULDER'S A BITCH.

154
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,700
PRIEST GAVE HIM THAT.

155
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,600
YOU BEAT UP A PRIEST?

156
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,300
DO YOU MIND?

157
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,800
BE MY GUEST.

158
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,500
YOU GOT A LONG PENANCE AHEAD OF YOU.

159
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,400
START BY ANSWERING THE MAN'S QUESTIONS.

160
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,300
NOW!

161
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,500
WHO HIRED YOU?

162
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,600
I DON'T KNOW. I GOT A CALL
ON MY CELL WITH AN OFFER,

163
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,800
AND I CALLED HIM BACK
AFTER THE JOB WAS DONE.

164
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
HE PAID ME. THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

165
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,700
I SWEAR.

166
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
YOU GOT A NUMBER?

167
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
CAN YOU DO SOMETHING WITH THAT?

168
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,300
SEVEN DIGITS. I COULD FIND YOU ON MARS.

169
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,100
GENTLEMEN, WE'LL LEAVE YOU
TO YOUR INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

170
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,000
COME ON.

171
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,400
HOW 'BOUT THAT?
MAN, YOU -- YOU SEE ME?

172
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,000
HE WAS INJURED.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,300
WELL, SOMEBODY GOT TO FIGHT THE INJURED.

174
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,800
SHOOT, THAT'S MY NICHE.

175
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,800
??TRACE ON THE GANGBANGER'S CALL,

176
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,300
IT ROUTED THROUGH THIS DUDE'S
NUMBER FROM A PAY PHONE.

177
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,600
SO WE GOT NOTHING.

178
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,800
HOLD ON. HOLD ON.

179
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
THE PAY PHONE IS LOCATED HERE --

180
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,600
THE RESIDENCES AT 8th.

181
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,200
LUXURY CONDOS BROUGHT
TO YOU BY ANDREW GRANT.

182
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,200
YEAH, I KNOW THIS GUY.

183
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,100
HE BUILT THE MEADOW MALL
ON THE WEST SIDE --

184
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,400
YOU KNOW, THE ONE WITH THE MONORAIL.

185
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,500
NOW, THIS GUY DOESN'T HAPPEN TO
OWN ANY OF THE SHELL COMPANIES

186
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,000
THAT BOUGHT THE CHURCH, DOES HE?

187
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,200
WELL, I -- I CAN'T PROVE THAT,

188
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
BUT --

189
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,600
LET'S JUST PUT IT THIS WAY --

190
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,400
THOSE SHELL COMPANIES HAVE
THEIR DADDY'S LYIN' EYES.

191
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,500
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO WE
KNOW ABOUT THIS GRANT GUY?

192
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,200
WELL, THE MAN'S A MEDIA WHORE.

193
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,000
HE WENT THROUGH LIKE NINE
PUBLICISTS LAST YEAR ALONE.

194
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,200
HE'S, UH, CUTTING THE RIBBON
ON THIS PLACE TOMORROW.

195
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,700
ALSO, GRANT SURVIVED A
HELICOPTER CRASH LAST YEAR.

196
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,100
CHECKED OUT HIS PHARMACY ACCOUNT.

197
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,800
THE MAN POPS ANTIANXIETY PILLS LIKE PEZ.

198
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
WELL...

199
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,100
PUBLICISTS ARE LIKE PRIESTS.

200
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,500
YOU GOT TO TELL THEM ALL YOUR SECRETS.

201
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,300
SO THAT'S OUR WAY IN.
THE QUESTION IS -- HOW?

202
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,900
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

203
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,100
IF THIS GUY BEAT UP A PRIEST...

204
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,900
...WE'RE NOT GOING EASY ON HIM.

205
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,300
I GOT A DOZEN REPORTERS
WAITING FOR ME DOWNSTAIRS,

206
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,100
AND THE BACKDROP FOR MY
RIBBON CUTTING ISSCAFFOLDING?

207
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,800
IT WAS A MISCOMMUNICATION.

208
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
ISN'T THAT WHAT I PAY YOU FOR, TOMAS?

209
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
TO COMMUNICATE?

210
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,700
STOP SCREWING UP.

211
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:29,600
MR. GRANT?

212
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,900
KRISTI CONNELLY.
I'M A REPORTER WITHTHE LEDGER.

213
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,500
I WAS WONDERING IF I COULD
ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS.

214
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,300
MISS CONNELLY, I DON'T
KNOW HOW YOU GOT UP HERE,

215
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,200
BUT THE PRESS CONFERENCE
IS DOWN IN THE LOBBY.

216
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,900
- IT STARTS IN 10 MINUTES.
- NO, NO, I UNDERSTAND.

217
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,000
I JUST WONDERED IF I
COULD HAVE A MOMENT --

218
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
- WHERE'S THE FOREMAN?!
- OF YOUR TIME.

219
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,600
FRANCO!

220
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,200
WILLY WONKA'S HERE.

221
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,700
GOOD.

222
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,600
HIS RIDE'S ALMOST HERE.

223
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,500
OKAY...SHOWTIME.

224
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:00,600
ALL RIGHT, DID YOU REMBER
THE BIG SCISSORS THIS TIME?

225
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,200
DID YOU REMEMBER 'EM?

226
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,600
-OH, OH!
- OH.

227
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,900
OH, MY GOD! ARE YOU OKAY?

228
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

229
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,700
- I'M SO SORRY!
- ???

230
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,800
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO DO THAT.
- THAT'S OK. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

231
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,500
JUST BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME. OKAY.

232
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,300
- OH, MY GOD.
- I'M SO SORRY.

233
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,800
I'M SORRY, MAN.

234
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,100
I APOLOGIZE ABOUT THAT.

235
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,200
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?!

236
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
I HAD A LOT OF TEQUILA
LAST NIGHT. I'M SORRY.

237
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,500
WATCH YOUR FOCUS, CUERVO. ALL RIGHT?

238
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,200
I FEEL REALLY BAD.

239
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,700
YOU KNOW WHAT? FEEL BAD, ALL RIGHT?

240
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,500
- JUST GET BACK TO WORK.
- OH, THANKS.

241
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:41,100
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com presents</font>

Sync:FRS@Ê¥µ®¿ìÀÖ</font>

243
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,500
OH!

244
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
OH.

245
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,400
OH, I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

246
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,200
THEY'RE FIXING UP THIS LIFT, RIGHT?

247
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,300
THERE'S PROBABLY A FEW BUGS TO WORK OUT.

248
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,300
UNACCEPTABLE.

249
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,100
I'M CALLING THE CONTRACTOR.

250
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,100
OH, SERIOUSLY? NO SIGNAL?

251
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
OHH!

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
OKAY. THAT'S...WEIRD.

253
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,800
YEAH.

254
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,600
I'M NOT CRAZY ABOUT HEIGHTS.

255
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,300
OR ENCLOSED SPACES.

256
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,800
WHAT IS THAT YOU JUST TOOK?

257
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,600
XANAX.

258
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,200
For my nerves.

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,500
ACTUALLY, CAFFEINE.

260
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,200
WITH A DASH OF DEXTROAMPHETAMINE.

261
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,800
???

262
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,500
ARE YOU GETTING ANY AIR AT ALL DOWN THERE?

263
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,900
GOD, I THINK THEY'VE SUCKED
ALL THE OXYGEN OUT OF HERE.

264
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,600
THEY'RE TORTURING ME.

265
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,700
IT'S LIKE THE WITCHES' OVEN IN
"HANSEL AND GRETEL" OR SOMETHING.

266
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,900
THEY'RE JUST ROASTING US LIKE A TURKEY!

267
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,600
YOU GAVE HIM SPEED?

268
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,300
HE BEAT UP A PRIEST.

269
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,400
GET ME OUT OF HERE!

270
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,400
????

271
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,300
CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME??

272
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,500
I'M GONNA FIRE EVERY ONE OF YOU!

273
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,200
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU!

274
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,100
YOU ARE SO FIRED!

275
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,800
MR. GRANT.

276
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,600
IS ANYBODY EVEN LISTENING?

277
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,200
- MR. GRANT.
- WHAT?

278
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,800
THE PRESS.

279
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,500
THEY'RE STILL DOWN THERE.

280
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,900
WE'VE ONLY BEEN UP HERE FOR HALF AN HOUR.

281
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,800
OH, GOD.

282
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,900
OH, GOD. OH, THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE A FIELD DAY WITH ME.

283
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,500
- I MEAN, LOOK AT ME.
- SEND US HOME.

284
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
OH! SEE?

285
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,700
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

286
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,500
I CAN'T, I CAN'T --

287
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,800
COME ON. YOU'VE GOT TO
STAND UP AND PICK ME UP.

288
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,300
YES. YES, TRUST ME.

289
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,400
- COME ON. TRUST ME.
- WHAT?

290
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,900
TRUST ME. AND PICK ME UP.

291
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,800
SOMEONE???

292
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,300
???

293
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
SHE FAINTED! SHE FAINTED!

294
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,600
SHE FAINTED! COME ON! COME ON!

295
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,700
MOVE OUT OF THE WAY, WOULD YA?

296
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,200
THIS WOMAN NEEDS MEDICAL ATTENTION!

297
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,500
OKAY, COME ON. COME ON!

298
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
COME ON. YOU'LL BE OKAY.

299
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,700
STAY WITH ME, SWEETHEART.

300
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,000
STAY WITH ME. STAY WITH ME.

301
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,100
GET SOME -- WOULD YOU --??

302
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,600
OKAY. OKAY, OKAY, SWEETHEART.

303
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,200
OKAY. YOU'LL BE OKAY.

304
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,200
MISS CONNELLY, YOU JUST
GOT YOURSELF AN INTERVIEW.

305
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,100
OKAY, BACK OFF! NO MORE PICTURES, OKAY?

306
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,600
SO, UM, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY HAS
BEEN THE KEY TO YOUR, UM --

307
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,700
OH, THANKS.

308
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,800
METEORIC RISE? HUH?

309
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,400
AN APPETITE FOR RISK? HARD WORK?

310
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,800
A BIT OF LUCK HERE AND THERE?

311
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,300
THIS INTERVIEW IS OVER.

312
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,400
I'M SORRY?

313
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,700
KRISTI.

314
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:18,800
HOW DID YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO IN THERE?

315
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,300
OH, THAT. I'M A REPORTER.

316
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,100
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND,

317
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,100
REPORTERS, WE'RE LAZY BY NATURE.

318
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,200
ALL WE WANT IS A STORY, A NARRATIVE.

319
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,700
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE
THE STORY THEY'RE WRITING,

320
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,900
JUST GIVE THEM A NEW ONE.

321
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,300
THEY'LL THANK YOU FOR IT.

322
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,600
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO A STORY ON ME.

323
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,400
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

324
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:40,000
I WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE
EVERYONEELSE IS DOING A STORY ON ME.

325
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,900
I SAW THE WAY YOU HANDLED
THE PRESS BACK THERE.

326
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,200
I WANT YOU TO BE MY NEW PUBLICIST.

327
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,600
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,

328
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:52,000
EXCEPT... WHEN CAN I START?!

329
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,000
HOW 'BOUT TOMORROW?

330
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,900
OF COURSE IF I'M GONNA BE
YOUR PUBLICIST, ANDY?

331
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,800
I'M GONNA NEED COMPLETE ACCESS TO YOUR BUSINESS.

332
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,700
THERE CAN'T BE ANY SECRETS BETWEEN US.

333
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,600
NONE.

334
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,300
LET ME SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

335
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,600
HE'S BUILDING ANOTHER MALL
ON THE SITE OF THE CHURCH.

336
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:15,700
IT'S NOT EVEN A MALL.

337
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,700
IT'S A BLOODY "LIFESTYLE" CENTER.

338
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,600
EAT, WORK, SHOP, PLAY,
ALL IN ONE PLACE.

339
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,300
I DON'T LIKE THIS GUY. I HATE HIM.

340
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,900
HE DOESN'T WANT THE CLOSING
OF THE CHURCH CONNECTED TO HIM?

341
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,000
I'LL BET HE'S GOT THE
CITY COUNCIL IN HIS POCKET

342
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,500
AND GOT THE LAND FOR A SONG.

343
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,500
ONCE THIS DEAL CLOSES,
HE'S FREE AND CLEAR.

344
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,000
BY THE TIME THEY BREAK GROUND ON THIS MALL,

345
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,600
- HE'LL BE UNTOUCHABLE.
- FORGET ST. NICK.

346
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,700
WE'D BE BETTER OFF WITH THE
PATRON SAINT OF LOST CAUSES.

347
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:37,700
NO, NO, NO. HE TRUSTS YOU.

348
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,400
YOU CAN HOOK HIM.

349
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,900
YEAH, I KNOW I CAN, NATE,
BUT THERE'S NO TIME.

350
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,200
I MEAN, WE NEED A LONG
CON FOR THIS JOB. RIGHT?

351
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,400
IN THREE DAYS, HE OWNS THAT CHURCH.

352
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,100
SO WE GOT TO HIT HIM HARD NOW, INDIRECTLY.

353
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,500
YOU KNOW, STALL THE CLOSING.

354
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,300
AND BUY ENOUGH TIME TO BRING
HIM IN FOR A LONGER GAME.

355
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,000
YOU REALLY THINK HE'S GONNA FALL FOR THAT?

356
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,100
THIS GUY? I GOT TO BE HONEST WITH YOU --

357
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,700
WE'RE GONNA NEED A MIRACLE
TO SAVE THIS CHURCH.

358
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:03,000
SO LET'S, UH, GO STEAL OURSELVES A MIRACLE.

359
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,200
WHEN THAT CHURCH MIRACLE
AS THE WORK OF GOD???,

360
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:16,400
USUALLY THROUGH THE PRAYERS
AND INTERCESSIONS OF A SAINT,

361
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,600
FOR SOME SPECIFIC PURPOSE,

362
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,600
FREQUENTLY THE CONVERSION
OF THE UNBELIEVING.

363
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,900
HOW DO YOU KNOW ALL THIS STUFF?

364
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,700
I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH FATHER PAUL.

365
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,200
TO, UH...SEMINARY SCHOOL.

366
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,900
SO YOU DROPPED OUT OF
PRIEST SCHOOL TO BECOME A --

367
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,100
AN INSURANCE COP?

368
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,100
AND NOW YOU'RE THE LEADER
OF A BAND OF THIEVES.

369
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,200
NICE.

370
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,700
YOU'RE A CATHOLIC WHO
WANTS TO FAKE A MIRACLE.

371
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,700
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT PUTS
US IN MORAL-SIN TERRITORY.

372
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,400
SO NOW YOU'RE RELIGIOUS, TOO?

373
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,300
NO, NO, I'M NOT DENOMINATIONAL.

374
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,400
IT'S JUST, I NEVER DO ANYTHING
MY NANA SAID "DON'T DO."

375
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,700
THIS, WHAT WE DOIN',
IT JUST DON'T SEEM RIGHT.

376
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,100
WHAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT?
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

377
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,700
WE'RE TRYING TO SAVE A CHURCH, RIGHT?

378
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
SO, FAKING A MIRACLE, TO ME, SEEMS
LIKE THE QUICKEST WAY TO DO THAT.

379
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,700
EVEN ANDREW GRANT'S NOT GONNA
BUILD A MALL ON A HOLY SITE.

380
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,800
RIGHT, SO WE NEED THREE THINGS.

381
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,300
WE NEED A MIRACLE, WE NEED PUBLICITY,

382
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,100
AND WE NEED TO KEEP FATHER
PAUL OUT OF THE WAY.

383
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,500
HE CAN'T BE INVOLVED IN THIS AT ALL.

384
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,800
REPORTERS FOLLOW GRANT AROUND IN PACKS.

385
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,900
LET'S -- LET'S USE HIM AS BAIT.

386
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,400
USE HIS OWN PUBLICITY TO WRECK HIS PROJECT.

387
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400
THAT'S ELEGANT.

388
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,500
OKAY.

389
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,400
PARKER, WE NEED YOU TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL

390
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,200
AND KEEP FATHER PAUL THERE NO
MATTER WHAT -- UP TO A POINT.

391
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,400
BUT KEEP HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.

392
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,600
ELIOT, YOU'RE THE RETRIEVAL SPECIALIST.

393
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,200
GIVE HARDISON ANYTHING HE NEEDS.

394
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,400
AS LONG AS I DON'T HAVE
TO DO ANYTHING IMMORAL.

395
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,500
AH, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

396
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,000
NO, I JUST NEED YOU TO FIGURE OUT,

397
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,400
YOU KNOW, HOW TO FAKE A MIRACLE.

398
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,700
WE ALL GOING TO HELL.

399
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,000
YOU KNOW I'M GETTING OUT
OF HERE IN A COUPLE HOURS.

400
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,100
YEAH, IT'S JUST A FEW LAST
TESTS TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE.

401
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,700
YOU LEAKED THIS?

402
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,000
They're calling for his head.

403
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,800
IT'S A P.R. NIGHTMARE.

404
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,900
TRUST ME, HE'S RATTLED, VULNERABLE --

405
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:19,900
AWW, JUST RIGHT FOR ME TO KISS
AND MAKE BOO-BOO BETTER.

406
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,300
HE'LL BE A MINUTE.

407
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,700
IT'S BUSY TODAY.

408
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,700
IT CERTAINLY IS.

409
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,400
SO, WHAT'S YOUR TAKE ON ALL OF THIS?

410
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,600
THE NEW MALL?

411
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,800
I MEAN LIFESTYLE CENTER?

412
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,500
WE'RE BUILDING RIGHT
AROUND WHERE I GREW UP.

413
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,500
I FIGURED IT WOULD SWEEP OUT THE GANGS.

414
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,400
GOOD ON YA.

415
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,600
YOU'RE A COMPANY MAN.

416
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,100
YES ?? THANK YOU FOR YOUR OPINION.

417
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,600
OK, I JUST RECEIVED A
THREATENING PHONE CALL --

418
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,100
FROM A NUN!

419
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
WELL, MR. GRANT, THE PROBLEM IS
THE REPORTERS HAVE THEIR STORY.

420
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,500
YEAH, "ANDREW GRANT, NEIGHBORHOOD WRECKER."

421
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,600
LIKE THERE'S EVEN A NEIGHBORHOOD THERE.

422
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,200
IT'S A BUNCH OF LOSERS
AND BURNT-OUT BUILDINGS.

423
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,700
THE PROBLEM IS, THEY HAVE THE WRONG STORY.

424
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,100
AND WHAT DO WE DO WHEN
REPORTERS HAVE THE WRONG STORY?

425
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,500
GIVE THEM A NEW ONE?

426
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,200
YOU NEED TO TAKE CONTROL OF THIS.

427
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,700
MAKE AN OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.

428
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,100
GIVE THEM THE OTHER STORY.

429
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,500
YEAH, SURE. OF COURSE.

430
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,700
THE CHURCH.

431
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,400
DO IT AT THE CHURCH.

432
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,200
THE CHURCH'S DOORS ARE CLOSING --

433
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,800
AWW -- BOOHOO --

434
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,200
BUT YOU'RE OPENING NEW DOORS.

435
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,900
OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL!

436
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,900
YES.

437
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
YES. TOMAS?

438
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,800
WE'LL MAKE THE OFFICIAL
ANNOUNCEMENT DOWN ON FIRST!

439
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,600
HUH? CALL EVERY REPORTER IN THE CITY!

440
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,700
WONDERFUL. I'LL SET IT UP.

441
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,100
COME ON, COME ON.??

442
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,400
COME ON, WE??? GO??

443
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,700
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, TOMAS?

444
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,800
I'M COMING, MR GRENT.

445
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,100
ALL RIGHT, FATHER, I GOT
YOUR TEST RESULTS RIGHT HERE.

446
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,000
MM. HIGH CHOLESTEROL,

447
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,600
ELEVATED SED RATE.

448
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,400
AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE PREGNANT.

449
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,000
I'M GONNA NEED YOU TO
STICK AROUND AND RE-TEST.

450
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
BEHOLD!

451
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,800
I HAVE MADE THE STATUES MULTIPLY.

452
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,600
WELL, I GOT TO SAY, IT
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD, HARDISON.

453
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,100
I MEAN -- YEAH.

454
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,300
IT'S, UH...

455
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,900
...POLYSTYRENE?

456
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,300
AMONGST OTHER THINGS.

457
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
DON'T EAT IT.

458
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,000
OR BREATHE NEAR IT.

459
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:19,600
ALL RIGHT.

460
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,800
SHOW US WHAT YOU GOT.

461
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,600
TEST SUBJECT NUMBER ONE.

462
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,600
YEAH, NO, YEAH, I SAID BLEEDING TEARS,

463
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,300
NOT -- NOT BLEEDING EARS.

464
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,100
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK, MAN.

465
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,200
YOU'RE LUCKY, ON THIS DEADLINE,

466
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU A BAKING SODA VOLCANO.

467
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
YEAH, THIS -- THIS IS --

468
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,700
OKAY, WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

469
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,000
LOOKS RIDICULOUS.

470
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,700
STIGMATA PAINTBALL GUN.

471
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,200
WELL, NO, NO, NO, NO. NO.

472
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,100
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

473
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,700
NOW -- HOW DOES THAT WORK?

474
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,600
I'VE BEEN PRACTICING. CHECK ME OUT.

475
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,800
OKAY, HARDISON,

476
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,200
WOULD YOU JUST MAKE THE STATUE
CRY WITHOUT MELTING ST. NICK'S HEAD?

477
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,100
DON'T MELT SANTA!

478
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,900
- HE'S NOT SANTA!
- HE'S NOT SANTA!

479
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,000
WHAT ARE YOU, 10 FEET FROM THERE?

480
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:21,800
HOW CAN YOU MISS THAT?

481
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,500
- YOU STAND RIGHT HERE.
- EVERYBODY CAN'T BE ELIOT.

482
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,300
- UNBELIEVABLE.
- SHUT UP. SHUT UP.

483
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,000
GRANT LINED UP?

484
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,800
UH-HUH. YEAH, HE'LL BE THERE,

485
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,000

00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,800
OH, UM, I'VE BEEN --

487
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,100

494
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,400
NO, NO, NOT THAT. WELL, YEAH.

495
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
I MEAN...

496
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,900
YEAH, AND OTHER THINGS.

497
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,300
THINGS, BUT...

498
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,100
YOU NEVER CHEATED ON HER, NATE.

499
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,300
I KNOW.

500
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,400
I KNOW.

501
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,400
TEMPTED.

502
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,000
- NO. NO, YOU WEREN'T.
- I WAS.

503
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
NOT REALLY.

504
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,000
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE GOOD GUY.

505
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,500
THAT'S -- THAT'S WHAT MADE IT FUN.

506
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:43,300
WELL, PART OF WHAT MADE
IT FUN BETWEEN US BACK THEN.

507
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,700
BACK THEN. YEAH.

508
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,400
AND...

509
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,200
WHAT ABOUT NOW?

510
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,400
I DON'T KNOW. WHAT ABOUT NOW?

511
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,700
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT.

512
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:00,800
BY "WE," UM, I MEAN "YOU" OF COURSE.

513
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,700
OF COURSE.

514
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,700
OF COURSE.

515
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,500
JUST, UM...

516
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,800
DON'T TAKE TOO LONG.

517
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:25,400
A LIFESTYLE CENTER TO REVITALIZE
THE LIFE OF THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

518
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,100
A PULSING HEART OF OPPORTUNITY

519
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:30,800
- AND COMMERCE IN THE CENTER OF THE COMMUNITY.
- EVERYBODY, COME QUICKLY!

520
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,300
YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS!

521
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,300
IT'S A MIRACLE!

522
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,800
It's a miracle.

523
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,400
It's a miracle.

524
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,600
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT.

525
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,200
NOT TOO BAD.

526
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,600
IT WAS NOTHING, REALLY.

527
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,900
IT'S JUST BASIC CHEMISTRY.

528
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:02,400
AN OIL POLYMER THAT REACTS WITH A
SECONDARY CHEMICAL IN THE CANDLES.

529
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
NO CANDLE SMOKE, ABSOLUTELY NO EVIDENCE.

530
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:06,300
LIGHT A CANDLE.

531
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:09,400
LOCAL NEWS WILL PICK UP THE EVENT,

532
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,100
GRANT WILL CRAWL BACK
INTO HIS HOLE FOR A WHILE,

533
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,000
AND, WELL, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING,

534
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,800
IT WILL STAY OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.

535
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,700
WHOA.

536
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,500
WHOA.

537
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,900
THAT'S A LOT OF PUBLIC.

538
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,900
- I'M VERY GOOD.
- YEAH.

539
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,500
A LITTLE TOO GOOD.

540
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,200
WHAT DID WE JUST DO?

541
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:51,900
THE WEEPING STATUE OF ST. NICK IS ON YouTube.

542
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,900
GOOD. THIS CHURCH WILL NEVER SHUT DOWN.

543
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,500
THERE'S JUST SO MANY PEOPLE HERE.

544
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,900
I MEAN, WHAT IF THEY
FIND OUT IT'S A...fake?

545
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:01,200
HELL FIRE, DAMNATION, ET CETERA.

546
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,400
YOU KNOW WHAT?

547
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,300
I'M GONNA STEP OVER HERE,

548
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,600
SO WHEN THE GOOD LORD
THROWS DOWN ON ALL OF Y'ALL,

549
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,800
I DON'T GET HIT BY THE LIGHTNING.

550
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,600
WASN'T ZEUS THE ONE WITH THE LIGHTNING?

551
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:12,100
GUYS, GUYS, THIS IS STILL A BIG WIN.

552
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,200
SOPHIE, UH, FIND OUT WHERE GRANT IS,

553
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,900
- AND MAKE SURE HE'S --
- WHAT DID YOU DO?

554
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,100
UH, WHAT -- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

555
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:24,300
WHAT, YOU -- YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN MIRACLES?

556
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,000
THE WORD "MIRACLE" DOES NOT APPEAR
ANYWHERE IN THE OLD OR NEW TESTAMENTS.

557
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,700
WHAT ABOUT THE WEDDING AT CANA? HUH?

558
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,500
WHAT ABOUT LAZARUS?

559
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,400
PLEASE TELL ME YOU HAD
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

560
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,800
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

561
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:34,800
NATE?

562
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,600
YOU'RE LYING TO ME,
RIGHT TO MY FACE.

563
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:39,900
IN CHURCH!

564
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,900
There's a fake miracle in my church.

565
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,700
Shh.

566
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,900
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A REASON
YOU DIDN'T BECOME A PRIEST.

567
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,300
I DO WHAT I CAN.

568
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,200
YOU CAN'T PLAY GOD, NATE.

569
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,500
JUST TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON,

570
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,700
AND WE'LL TRY TO FIX IT.

571
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,800
PAUL, LISTEN TO ME.

572
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,400
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD, I CAN'T
TELL YOU WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

573
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,500
BUT I CAN TELL YOU...

574
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:03,700
THAT I -- THAT I GOT IT COVERED.

575
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,500
THEY'RE IN SPIN MODE.

576
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,000
IT'S A MESS.

577
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:14,900
I'M GONNA PUT A NAIL
IN HIS COFFIN RIGHT NOW.

578
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,500
WELL, MAKE IT 10.

579
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,600
I DON'T WANT THAT SON
OF A BITCH CRAWLING OUT.

580
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,500
SO...

581
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,600
UGH. ST. NICHOLAS.

582
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,100
A MIRACLE.

583
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,900
OBVIOUSLY WE CAN'T --

584
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,600
YEAH. I KNOW. I'VE BEEN
UP ALL NIGHT WITH THIS.

585
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,300
I FIGURED AS MUCH.

586
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,600
- I DO HAVE A SPIN ON IT.
- NO, NO, NO, FORGET IT.

587
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,200
I'VE KILLED THE AMERICAN TOWN.

588
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,800
THIS MIRACLE -- IT GAVE ME
A REAL CRISIS OF CONSCIENCE.

589
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,300
EXCELLENT.

590
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,000
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD!

591
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,300
WE CAN -- WE CAN WORK WITH THAT.

592
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,800
I LOOKED INTO MY HEART.

593
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,600
I PACED. I CRIED.

594
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,500
BUT BY DAWN...

595
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,900
I HAD MY ANSWER.

596
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,500
BIBLETOPIA.

597
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,600
IT'S A THEME PARK?

598
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,600
AH AH! LIFESTYLE AND RECREATION CENTER.

599
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,900
HERE, LET ME GIVE YOU THE TOUR.

600
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,100
SO, THE CHURCH STAYS.

601
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,000
I MEAN, AT LEAST THE STATUE STAYS,

602
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,700
AND MAYBE THAT ONE WALL
WITH THE STAINED GLASS.

603
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,800
BUT THE REST -- GONE.

604
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:20,100
NOW, FLANKING THE STATUE -- TWO FOOD COURTS.

605
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,700
SO, THE ORIGINAL PEWS --

606
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,600
THEY'RE NOW OUTDOORS,
FOR MEALTIME SEATING,

607
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,100
HOLY CONTEMPLATION, WHATEVER.

608
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,100
SHOPS APLENTY ON THE PERIMETER.

609
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,300
BUT THIS --

610
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,500
THERE WILL BE A SEA --
AN ACTUAL SEA --

611
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,500
SURROUNDING THE PARK,
THAT WILL PART EVERY 30 MINUTES.

612
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
HUH?

613
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,100
AND THEN WHILE PEOPLE
ARE WAITING TO COME IN,

614
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,700
THEY CAN ENJOY PREVIEWS, FOOD, AND
SOUVENIRS AT THE TEARS OF ST. NICK CAFee.

615
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,500
COME TO PRAY, STAY TO SHOP.

616
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
WE ALSO GOT THESE --

617
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,200
ST. NICHOLAS BOBBLE-HEADS.

618
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,300
THERE YOU GO. MM.

619
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS?

620
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,400
COME ON, KRISTI.

621
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,600
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW,
THIS IS NOT A REAL MIRACLE.

622
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,000
"A," BECAUSE MIRACLES DON'T EXIST,

623
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,200
AND, 2, BECAUSE THIS
PAIN-IN-THE-ASS PRIEST WILL DO ANYTHING

624
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,300
TO KEEP HIS CHURCH OPEN.

625
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,700
BUT, HEY I OWE HIM A DEBT.

626
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,300
I MEAN, I NEVER WOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF

627
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,300
BIBLETOPIA WITHOUT HIS
DIVINE INTERVENTION.

628
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,100
THIS STUPID PRIEST --

629
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,300
HE'S GONNA MAKE ME MILLIONS.

630
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,300
BIBLETOPIA?

631
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,200
THE MAN CANNOT BE STOPPED!

632
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,500
IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING WE THROW
AT HIM JUST MAKES HIM STRONGER.

633
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,800
KIND OF ADMIRE HIM, THOUGH.

634
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,900
MY NEPHEW WOULD LIKE BIBLETOPIA.

635
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,400
OH, NO, SEE? THIS IS WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU MESS WITH GOD.

636
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,200
HE RAISES UP YOUR ENEMIES
WITH HIS RIGHT HAND,

637
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,500
AND HE SMITES YOU WITH HIS LEFT.

638
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,300
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

639
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,600
SO I CAN... WE CAN USE THIS.

640
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
JUST ME A SECOND TO --

641
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,700
I JUST NEED --

642
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,900
APOSTOLIC VISITATION.

643
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,300
COME AGAIN?

644
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,900
IT'S THE VATICAN.

645
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,400
WHAT?

646
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:08,900
APOSTOLIC VISITATION.
IT'S LIKE THE POPE'S CSI.

647
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,300
THEY COME, THEY INVESTIGATE A MIRACLE.

648
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,400
THEY DETERMINE WHETHER
IT'S REAL OR A HOAX.

649
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
IF THEY FIND OUT THE TRUTH,

650
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,800
THEY'RE GONNA CLOSE THIS CHURCH DOWN,

651
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,100
AND BLAME FATHER PAUL FOR FRAUD.

652
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,400
I DON'T LIKE THIS, NATE.

653
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,000
EVEN GRANT, OKAY? HE WAS HOOKED.

654
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,900
ORDINARILY WE'D HAVE HIM

655
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,000
- UNDER CONTROL BY NOW.
- WE'LL GET AROUND HIM.

656
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,500
WE'LL SAVE THE CHURCH,

657
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,900
- AND WE'LL TAKE OUT GRANT --
- YOU SCREWED UP.

658
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,400
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO UNDO YOUR OWN CON.

659
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
GENTLEMEN.

660
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,800
AH! FATHER, FATHER!

661
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,800
EXCUSE -- I AM HAVING
JUST BIG SPIRITUAL CRIS.

662
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,600
YOU GUYS COULD UNDERSTAND MORE THAN ANYBODY.

663
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:44,500
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

664
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,300
YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE...

665
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,200
I hope you weren't gonna do

666
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,500
what I know you were just about to do.

667
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,400
What, tell the truth?

668
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,500
You bet I was.

669
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,500
Nate, no more lies!

670
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,000
The Vatican's here!

671
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,500
You and I both know what that means.

672
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,100
Yeah, break out the grappa.

673
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,100
DOES MY GETTING DEFROCKED AMUSE YOU?

674
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:02,700
NO, Listen, just let me
explain this to you, okay?

675
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,300
I just -- this is --

676
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,800
In here.

677
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,000
OH, THERE'S ALWAYS A LOOPHOLE WITH YOU.

678
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,600
That's my side!

679
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,300
???

680
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,200
?????

681
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,000
I GET IMMUNITY, OF COURSE.

682
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,500
NOTHING I SAY CAN BE REPEATED TO ANYONE,

683
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,200
NOR IS IT ADMISSIBLE IN A COURT OF LAW.

684
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,600
START IT RIGHT.

685
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,100
SO, THE STATUE.

686
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,800
BLESS ME, FATHER...

687
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,300
"UH, BLESS ME, FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED."

688
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,400
IT HAS BEEN --

689
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:40,000
"IT'S BEEN 2 YEARS, 3 MONTHS,

690
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,500
AND 15 DAYS SINCE MY LAST CONFESSION."

691
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,500
I WAS AT THE FUNERAL.

692
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,500
SO, THE STATUE --

693
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,500
- WE FAKED A MIRACLE.
- I KNOW.

694
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,200
NOW, I HAD NO IDEA THAT IT
WOULD GET AS MUCH ATTENTION --

695
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,800
AS AND GRANT --

696
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,600
THAT HE WOULD TURN AROUND

697
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,800
AND HE WOULD TRY TO PROFIT FROM IT.

698
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:05,700
"I HAVE COMMITTED A STRING OF SELFISH

699
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,000
AND HURTFUL ACTS... FATHER."

700
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,400
WRONG ACTS, RIGHT REASONS.

701
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,600
OH, THE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS?

702
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,700
IS THAT IT, NATE? IS THAT IT?

703
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:15,700
THE DETAILS.

704
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,100
GOD LOOKS AT HOW WE DO A THING,

705
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,000
AND HE JUDGES.

706
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,400
HEY, I'M OUT HERE HELPING PEOPLE.

707
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,500
- I MEAN THAT...
- ARE YOU?

708
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,500
OR ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL YOURSELF?

709
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,900
MAYBE TAKE A COUPLE OF
BAD GUYS DOWN WITH YOU.

710
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,500
I AM TRYING TO SAVE YOUR DAMN CHURCH.

711
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,300
SAVE MY CHURCH?

712
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,700
YOU FAKED A MIRACLE!

713
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,200
MY PARISHIONERS, MY FLOCK, MY CHURCH --

714
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,000
THEY -- THEY BELIEVED IN THAT MIRACLE.

715
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,700
AND NOW YOU ARE RIPPING OUT THAT FAITH

716
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,300
AND REPLACING IT WITH A LIE.

717
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,600
MAYBE -- MAYBE I'M NOT HERE
TO SAVE THIS CHURCH, NATE.

718
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,200
MAYBE I NEED TO LOSE THIS CHURCH TO SAVE YOU.

719
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,000
GO AND SIN NO MORE.

720
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,600
EXCUSE ME.

721
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,900
ANDY, UM,

722
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,000
THERE'S A BIT OF TROUBLE.

723
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,900
NOTHING ALARMING. IT'S JUST, UM...

724
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,400
THE VATICAN'S HERE.

725
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,100
I KNOW. ISN'T IT GREAT?

726
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,300
GREAT?

727
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,300
IF THEY THINK IT'S REAL,
WE GO FORWARD WITH BIBLETOPIA.

728
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,300
IF THEY EXPOSE IT WELL,

729
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,600
THEN I GET GOOD PRESS FOR
CLOSING THIS FRAUD PARISH.

730
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,000
YOU SEE, WHEN PEOPLE SAY "CONTROVERSY,"

731
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,500
I HEAR "ATTENTION."

732
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,000
- ANDY...
- HUH?

733
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,000
YOU ARE SHAMELESS.

734
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,000
OH, GOD, YOU GET ME SO WELL.

735
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:50,400
HEY, COME ON, GET A
PICTURE WITH THESE GUYS.

736
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,800
???

737
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,100
??

738
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,600
????

739
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,800
IT'S GOOD???

740
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:04,400
????

741
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:07,800
??WITH YOU GUYS.

742
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,500
???

743
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,700
I'M GOING TO CONFESSION.

744
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,700
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

745
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,100
THAT'S GREAT.

746
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,900
AS SOON AS THAT VAN FULL OF VATICAN CSI
EQUIPMENT GETS HERE, WE'RE SCREWED.

747
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,200
THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY,

748
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,600
BUT YOU GUYS WOULDN'T LET ME TALK
WHILE WE WERE ALL in the closet!

749
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,500
IF WE LEAVE IT HERE,

750
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,800
THEY'RE GONNA FIND OUT THE
STATUE ISN'T REALLY CRYING

751
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,300
AND BLAME FATHER PAUL FOR FRAUD.

752
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,800
SOPHIE, IF WE STEAL THE STATUE,

753
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,300
HE'S GONNA GET BLAMED
FOR COVERING UP A FRAUD.

754
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,300
HUH.

755
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,500
THIS AIN'T FUNNY.

756
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,400
AS SOON AS THEY RUN A SCAN
OR A PH STICK OVER THAT STATUE,

757
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,200
THEY'RE GONNA SEE THOSE AREN'T REAL TEARS.

758
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
YOU'RE RIGHT.

759
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,000
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.

760
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,800
YOU KNOW, FATHER PAUL --

761
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,400
HE CAN'T HELP BUT TELL THE TRUTH.

762
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,200
HE'S GONNA FLIP ON US.

763
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,900
I HOPE THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU SUGGEST PRAYER.

764
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:16,700
No, the Weeping Statue of
St. Nicholas is not gonna be stolen.

765
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,200
It's gonna miraculously disappear

766
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,300
in the middle of tomorrow's mass.

767
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,100
I'M SORRY?

768
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:25,200
In front of the priest, the Vatican,

769
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,700
the entire congregation.

770
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:28,800
HAVE YOU LEARNED NOTHING, NATE?

771
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,100
HOW MUCH DOES THE STATUE WEIGH?

772
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,700
- ABOUT 900 POUNDS.
- GOOD.

773
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,400
I AM SO SORRY, NANA.

774
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,500
THE LORD BE WITH YOU.

775
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,200
AND ALSO WITH YOU.

776
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,900
A READING FROM THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO LUKE.

777
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,400
GLORY TO YOU, LORD.

778
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,800
"A MAN HAD A FIG TREE IN HIS VINEYARD,

779
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,800
"BUT IT DID NOT BEAR FRUIT.

780
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,200
"SO HE SAID TO THE MAN
WHO TOOK CARE OF THE VINEYARD,

781
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,100
"'FOR THREE YEARS, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR FRUIT ON THIS TREE,

782
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,200
"'AND FOR THREE YEARS,
I'VE FOUND NOTHING.

783
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,500
"IT'S A WASTE OF MY LAND.

784
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,600
CUT IT DOWN!'

785
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,000
"'SIR,' THE WORKER REPLIED,

786
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,200
"'LEAVE IT ALONE FOR ONE MORE YEAR.

787
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,800
"'LET ME DIG AROUND IT AND FERTILIZE IT.

788
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,900
"'IF IT BEARS FRUIT NEXT YEAR,

789
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,200
ALL IS WELL.

790
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,600
IF NOT, THEN CUT IT DOWN.'"

791
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,600
THE GOSPEL OF THE LORD.

792
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,800
????

793
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,200
REPENT!

794
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,200
OR PERISH!

795
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,400
THAT'S LUKE 13.

796
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,700
TOUGH TO SWALLOW, HUH?

797
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,500
BUT LIKE ALL PARABLES,

798
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,300
THIS ONE'S OPEN TO INTERPRETATION.

799
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,100
WAS THE WORKER JUST BEING LAZY?

800
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,400
STALLING?

801
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,900
"I'LL GET TO IT, BOSS, NEXT YEAR.

802
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,400
MAÃANA."

803
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,100
OR DID THE WORKER HAVE A SECRET?

804
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,800
A SECRET --

805
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,100
THAT ONLY OUR FAITH SUSTAINS US OVER TIME.

806
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,900
THE OWNER DOESN'T HAVE
HIS HANDS IN THE SOIL.

807
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,600
ONLY THE WORKER IS THERE
EVERY DAY IN THE DIRT,

808
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,300
WITH THE TREE.

809
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,600
HE HAS FAITH IN HIS SKILL

810
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,300
AND FAITH THAT GOD WILL SUPPORT THAT SKILL,

811
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,500
AND MAYBE, IN A YEAR'S TIME,

812
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,200
THE TREE WILL BEAR FRUIT.

813
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,900
HE DOESN'T LOOK FOR THE EASY WAY OUT.

814
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,600
HE DOESN'T SAY,

815
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,500
"OH, WHY WOULD THE LORD DO THIS TO ME?

816
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:28,600
"IF ONLY HE WOULD GIVE ME A SIGN.

817
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,600
IF ONLY HE'D GIVE US A MIRACLE."

818
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:37,100
BUT THE WORKER DOESN'T ASK FOR A MIRACLE.

819
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:41,000
HE HAS FAITH IN HIMSELF AND FAITH IN GOD,

820
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
AND HE ONLY ASKS FOR TIME.

821
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,200
LET US PROCLAIM OUR FAITH.

822
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,000
WE BELIEVE IN ONE GOD,

823
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,800
THE FATHER, THE ALMIGHTY,

824
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,400
THE MAKER OF HEAVEN AND EARTH,

825
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,000
OF ALL THAT IS SEEN AND UNSEEN.

826
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,600
WE BELIEVE IN ONE LORD, JESUS CHRIST,

827
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,300
THE ONLY SON OF GOD.

828
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,800
ETERNALLY BEGOTTEN OF THE FATHER.

829
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,100
GOD FROM GOD, LIGHT FROM LIGHT,

830
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,900
TRUE GOD FROM TRUE GOD,

831
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,200
BEGOTTEN, NOT MADE,
ONE IN BEING WITH THE FATHER.

832
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,900
OK.

833
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,100
THAT'LL DO IT.

834
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,900
- WHOA!
- YEAH.

835
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,700
FOR US MEN, FOR OUR SALVATION...

836
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,800
I SAW WHAT HAPPENED!

837
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,000
AN ANGEL TOOK IT AWAY!

838
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,000
CALM DOWN, PEOPLE!
THAT'S NOT WHAT'S HAPPENING!

839
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,200
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

840
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,900
THERE IS NO MIRACLE!

841
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,100
SOMEBODY STOLE THE STATUE!

842
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,700
AND I KNOW WHO IT IS!

843
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,200
ANDREW GRANT.

844
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,500
HEY, THAT'S THE GUY
THAT BOUGHT THE CHURCH!

845
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,500
THAT'S NOT MY VAN!

846
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,800
WHAT KIND OF MONSTER FAKES
A MIRACLE FOR A PROFIT?

847
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,200
- YOU SICKEN ME.
- THIEF!

848
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:27,900
THE PRIEST IS DESPERATE.

849
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,900
LOOK, HE HID THE STATUE IN THE VAN.

850
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:32,500
HE FORGED THE REGISTRATION
PAPERS TO FRAME ME!

851
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,000
- I DON'T BELIEVE YA!
- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

852
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,600
RIGHT HERE. SEE?

853
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,100
MY ASSISTANT --
HE WAS WITH ME THE WHOLE TIME.

854
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
OKAY? NOW, LOOK.

855
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,600
WE BOUGHT THIS PROPERTY --

856
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,900
WE'RE GONNA FIX UP THE NEIGHBORHOOD! RIGHT?

857
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,200
NO.

858
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,300
"NO."

859
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:48,800
NO!

860
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,600
HE GOT THE LAND UNDER THIS CHURCH

861
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,600
THE SAME WAY HE GOT THE
REST OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

862
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
THE SAME WAY HE GETS
ALL OF HIS PROPERTIES --

863
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,000
BY BRIBERY, INTIMIDATION, AND VIOLENCE!

864
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,700
ANDREW GRANT...

865
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,100
SENT A BUNCH OF THUGS
TO BEAT UP FATHER PAUL!

866
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,300
IF I GO TO THE POLICE WITH WHAT I HAVE,

867
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,300
I COULD PUT HIM IN JAIL.

868
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,800
AND ME, TOO, PROBABLY.

869
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,400
FATHER...

870
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,800
WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT?

871
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,900
Yes, I HAVE TO DO THE RIGHT THING???

872
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,600
BIG BULLY!

873
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,900
????

874
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,800
???

875
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,600
OK, GREAT. GOOD.

876
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,000
- OK.
- COPS GOT HERE FAST.

877
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,900
IT'S ALMOST AS IF AN INVESTIGATIVE
JOURNALIST CALLED THEM WITH A TIP-OFF.

878
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,800
KRISTI, SAVE ME, HUH?

879
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:47,100
YOU CAN SPIN THIS, RIGHT?
INSTEAD OF, UH, "FELONY,"

880
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,100
MAYBE SOFTEN IT TO, UH,
"CONTROVERSY" OR SOMETHING.

881
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,900
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU SAY "CONTROVERSY,"

882
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,600
I ALWAYS HEAR "ATTENTION."

883
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,600
OH!

884
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,000

00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,700
AND TOLD EVERYONE THE STATUE WAS A FAKE.

892
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,800
TO SAVE THE FAITH OF MY PARISH.

893
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,700
WRONG ACT, RIGHT REASONS.

894
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,200

895
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,000
