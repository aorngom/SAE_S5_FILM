1
00:00:00,424 --> 00:00:04,483
Somebody, please, help!
Hey! Open the door! Please!

2
00:00:05,023 --> 00:00:07,675
- She can't breathe!
- Can't you see the sign, pal?

3
00:00:07,676 --> 00:00:09,318
CLINIC PERMANANTLY CLOSED

4
00:00:09,319 --> 00:00:12,149
- Over here!
- Hey! Unlock the damn door!

5
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:15,369
- Asthma?
- Yeah, her inhaler's not working.

6
00:00:17,964 --> 00:00:20,750
- Get out of my way. Call for an ambulance.
- What do I do?

7
00:00:20,751 --> 00:00:24,214
Set her on the ground, but keep her upright.
This inhaler's gonna relax her muscles...

8
00:00:24,215 --> 00:00:25,081
Okay.

9
00:00:25,082 --> 00:00:28,427
...while the epinephrine
opens the airway.

10
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:34,602
There you go.

11
00:00:35,777 --> 00:00:38,950
- Oh, thank God. Thank you.
- Yeah.

12
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,246
She could've died.
I mean, she would've died.

13
00:00:42,247 --> 00:00:44,247
Well, she- she was very lucky
you were there.

14
00:00:44,248 --> 00:00:46,307
No, luck shouldn't have
anything to do with it.

15
00:00:46,308 --> 00:00:48,890
You know, the clinic
never should have closed.

16
00:00:48,891 --> 00:00:51,505
- And it's all my fault.
- Hey, it's- it's not your fault.

17
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:53,541
There's no way
you could've seen this coming.

18
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:56,789
No, I was the one that recommended
Mr. Fowler to our board of directors.

19
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,834
You know, he told me that the fund
would double our clinic's money in a year.

20
00:00:59,835 --> 00:01:01,855
- I believed him.
- It's okay.

21
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:04,343
We all do stupid things sometimes.

22
00:01:05,155 --> 00:01:07,411
No, uh, she...

23
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:11,241
Um-- How did you meet Daniel Fowler?

24
00:01:11,242 --> 00:01:15,022
I only volunteer at the clinic on weekends.
My day job is at Dalton Academy.

25
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:18,185
It's that private school up near Brighton.
And I'm the on-site nurse there.

26
00:01:18,186 --> 00:01:23,660
And Fowler's stepson is a student there.
He's a sweet kid. Allergic to strawberries.

27
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:25,646
That's ironic.

28
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:28,753
- Why?
- Because he's sweet.

29
00:01:29,106 --> 00:01:30,533
Yeah, uh...

30
00:01:31,078 --> 00:01:35,319
A lot of the parents had money
invested with him. And I figured...

31
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:38,857
you know, if they could trust him,
then we could, too.

32
00:01:38,858 --> 00:01:42,005
Okay, well, here's the thing.
The government has frozen Fowler's assets.

33
00:01:42,006 --> 00:01:45,682
- So you'll get the money back eventually.
- No, the clinic is out of time.

34
00:01:45,683 --> 00:01:48,404
The board has put the property
up for sale next week.

35
00:01:48,405 --> 00:01:51,252
That's not gonna happen.
I promise.

36
00:01:53,459 --> 00:01:54,961
Sorry. Um...

37
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,902
It's just really hard to trust
people right now, you know?

38
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:01,866
That's okay. We don't
trust you either. So...

39
00:02:02,538 --> 00:02:04,162
No, she didn't...

40
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,721
Thank you for your time.

41
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:11,782
That went super.

42
00:02:12,723 --> 00:02:14,156
Oh, God...

43
00:02:14,857 --> 00:02:16,157
Where is Sophie?

44
00:02:16,905 --> 00:02:19,759
The rich and powerful,
they take what they want.

45
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,714
We steal it back for you.

Leverage.

50
00:02:36,857 --> 00:02:39,368
Thanks for meeting me this morning.

51
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:43,762
Sweetheart, listen-- I know you're crazy busy.
It's final-exam time and everything...

52
00:02:43,763 --> 00:02:47,092
but I was thinking this weekend
we should definitely...

53
00:02:47,093 --> 00:02:51,188
- definitely check out the venetian exhibit--
- I don't think so.

54
00:02:51,348 --> 00:02:54,082
I don't think that
this is working out.

55
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,168
Wait.
Listen, I know that...

56
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:03,764
You know, I travel a lot with...
my job.

57
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:06,619
It's not that. Um, listen...

58
00:03:07,308 --> 00:03:09,194
We talk all the time...

59
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:12,627
but it never feels like you're
actually sharing anything.

60
00:03:12,628 --> 00:03:14,713
As great as you are...

61
00:03:15,276 --> 00:03:18,059
there's always a mask.

62
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:22,481
I just don't know
who you really are, Catherine.

63
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:29,318
I got a class.

64
00:03:32,576 --> 00:03:33,722
Sophie.

65
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:35,694
Pardon?

66
00:03:44,001 --> 00:03:45,569
Or Alice...

67
00:03:46,354 --> 00:03:48,434
Karen, Michelle...

68
00:03:49,804 --> 00:03:51,147
Elizabeth...

69
00:03:54,575 --> 00:03:57,904
Hey. This looks like
an ordinary cellphone, right?

70
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:02,473
It's not, man.
It's a metal detector.

71
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:06,022
See, it uses
pulse-induction technology...

72
00:04:06,023 --> 00:04:09,128
that sends out a current
that generates a magnetic field...

73
00:04:09,129 --> 00:04:12,137
and then--
Are you even listening?

74
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:14,850
- Yeah.
- Well, what did I say?

75
00:04:14,944 --> 00:04:17,406
You were explaining
how you're still a virgin.

76
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:21,448
...isn't a kind of skill. Talking to clients.
You're supposed to sympathize.

77
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:23,580
I told you not to take her.

78
00:04:23,581 --> 00:04:26,108
- Well, you were right. Where's Sophie?
- I don't know.

79
00:04:26,109 --> 00:04:29,868
Well, we're not waiting.
Let's go. Let's start.

80
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:35,294
Daniel Fowler, 61,
C.E.O. of FTP Fidelity.

81
00:04:35,295 --> 00:04:39,723
Now, this is the largest private-investment firm
in the state-- Up until about three weeks ago.

82
00:04:39,724 --> 00:04:43,339
This whole thing was blown as a big Ponzi scheme.
And I'm not talking crooked investments.

83
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,330
I mean stone-cold con.

84
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:48,272
There was never any fund,
no trades, no real accounts.

85
00:04:48,273 --> 00:04:49,602
The clinic lost everything.

86
00:04:49,603 --> 00:04:52,947
10 years, this guy wore all the right suits
and filed all the right papers...

87
00:04:52,948 --> 00:04:54,759
with the S.E.C. Nobody looked twice.

88
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,040
Well, as soon as the FBI figured it out,
they slapped a little house arrest on him...

89
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,685
and they froze all his assets--
I'm talking corporate accounts...

90
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:02,570
personal accounts,
real-estate holdings.

91
00:05:02,571 --> 00:05:06,246
Anything on planet earth
with this dude's name on it is on ice.

92
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:09,423
- The FBI's very thorough, huh?
- Extremely.

93
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:12,231
- So what'd they miss?
- Oh.

94
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:18,188
$20 million. They moved it off the books
right before the warrants came down.

95
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:22,119
Yeah, well, he knew the end was near,
and he was getting ready to bolt.

96
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,147
Tell me something--
Where was Fowler arrested?

97
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:29,166
In his apartment, packing for his
"business trip" to the Maldives.

98
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:34,783
You see, he'd need it light,
portable, close at hand.

99
00:05:35,713 --> 00:05:37,741
That $20 million is in his apartment.

100
00:05:37,742 --> 00:05:41,980
Yeah, but this guy's on house arrest, man.
I mean, he's practically living with the FBI.

101
00:05:41,981 --> 00:05:46,327
The problem is not getting into
the apartment, but getting them out.

102
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,505
Where were you?

103
00:05:51,646 --> 00:05:53,789
Oh. I- I was running an errand.

104
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:55,899
Weren't you with the boyfriend?

105
00:05:58,637 --> 00:06:01,923
So, um, what are the terms
of his house arrest?

106
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:07,014
Fowler's confined to his $6 million
penthouse overlooking the Charles River.

107
00:06:07,015 --> 00:06:09,184
Yeah, that's a rough punishment, huh?

108
00:06:09,185 --> 00:06:13,513
The whole place is outfitted with 24/7
surveillance so the feds can keep an eye on him.

109
00:06:13,514 --> 00:06:14,678
Now...

110
00:06:15,236 --> 00:06:16,700
We can, too.

111
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:19,367
I piggybacked on their wireless feed.

112
00:06:19,368 --> 00:06:24,292
Still, for us to get in and search the place,
we've got to get rid of Fowler.

113
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:28,194
Now, there are three general
exceptions for house arrest.

114
00:06:28,195 --> 00:06:31,801
There's personal safety,
death of a relative, and family events.

115
00:06:31,802 --> 00:06:34,394
Personal safety.
We could burn the apartment down.

116
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:36,464
- Ooh! Ooh!
- Or...

117
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,459
death of a relative.

118
00:06:38,555 --> 00:06:40,396
Uh, w- who's that?

119
00:06:40,715 --> 00:06:42,762
Oh. Oh, the kid.

120
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:45,812
Kid's from her first marriage.
Widmark.

121
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:48,771
Oh, I'm sorry.
"Widmark"?

122
00:06:49,118 --> 00:06:51,494
- Rich people, man.
- Geez...

123
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,529
Oh, can you, uh,
punch in on that, please?

124
00:06:54,713 --> 00:06:56,900
Do you have any respect
for your personal property?

125
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:59,380
Do you have any respect for me?
I bought you that cellphone.

126
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:01,557
Dan.
He said he was sorry.

127
00:07:01,558 --> 00:07:03,629
Yeah.
He's sorry, all right.

128
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,829
I'd ground you, but you don't have
any friends to go out with anyway.

129
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:11,134
I'm gonna talk to him.
I'll be right back.

130
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:16,135
Wow. Okay.
What do we got on the kid?

131
00:07:17,681 --> 00:07:22,418
Widmark Fowler, age 10.
No arrests. No outstanding warrants.

132
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,770
Hardison...

133
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:27,116
He's a fifth-grade student
at Dalton Academy.

134
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:30,365
Academically unexceptional.
No extracurriculars.

135
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,717
He's allergic to strawberries.

136
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:34,961
Strawberries...

137
00:07:36,285 --> 00:07:39,829
Judges give out day passes
for family events.

138
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,652
It's one of the three things, right?
So Fowler...

139
00:07:42,653 --> 00:07:46,930
is going to ask for one
so he doesn't miss his kid's big debut.

140
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:50,350
Okay, I'll bite.
What's he debuting as?

141
00:07:53,486 --> 00:07:57,581
Yeah, I don't know. But we're gonna
go steal his school and find out.

142
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:05,408
- A mister Ando Buhari is here.
- I don't have any appointments.

143
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:09,470
- I know. Do you want--
- Oh, Dr. Jerrod.

144
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:11,931
Dr. Jerrod, come.

145
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,215
It's-- ahhh.
It's a pleasure.

146
00:08:17,216 --> 00:08:20,088
I am Anando Buhari,
Botswana special envoy.

147
00:08:20,089 --> 00:08:21,934
I work for president Khama.

148
00:08:21,935 --> 00:08:25,253
He is most impressed when he read
your paper you wrote as a student.

149
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,258
How do you say, your, um...

150
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,789
- The--
- That-- These--

151
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:31,513
The president of Botswana
read my grad-school thesis?

152
00:08:31,514 --> 00:08:34,724
Yes!
All 600 glorious pages...

153
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:39,637
from which insight drips like honey
upon which bees of wisdom feast.

154
00:08:40,386 --> 00:08:45,659
The president is rebuilding
the educational system from the ground up.

155
00:08:45,743 --> 00:08:48,849
Would you consider
going to Botswana to meet him?

156
00:08:48,934 --> 00:08:51,399
All expenses paid, of course.

157
00:08:51,505 --> 00:08:52,556
I...

158
00:08:56,306 --> 00:08:57,350
Yes.

159
00:08:57,752 --> 00:08:59,396
Everyone, settle down!

160
00:08:59,397 --> 00:09:04,572
I assure you everything is under control!
Mr. Jerrod just took a leave of absence.

161
00:09:04,573 --> 00:09:06,188
In the middle of the school year?

162
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:09,765
The school board has already
sent over an interim headmaster.

163
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:11,899
Would you be quiet?!

164
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,814
And after reading his file...

165
00:09:14,899 --> 00:09:18,572
I can assure you
we are in excellent hands!

166
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,079
Dr. Melcher?

167
00:09:30,657 --> 00:09:32,319
Guten Tag.

168
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,380
My name is Dr. Melcher.

169
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:40,131
And I presume
that you are all familiar...

170
00:09:40,132 --> 00:09:43,738
with the pre-eminent literature
on the children's education--

171
00:09:43,739 --> 00:09:46,536
My book,
"The Melcher Method"--

172
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:48,134
Ja?

173
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:53,038
In which case any further
introduction would be redundant.

174
00:09:53,871 --> 00:09:57,898
I'd like to begin
by speaking about the changes

175
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,160
we're going to be making
in the curriculum.

176
00:10:00,161 --> 00:10:01,177
Excuse me.

177
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:03,138
- Shh! Shh! Shh!
- Ja, ja?

178
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:06,788
Mark Sanford. I'm head of the
concerned parents association.

179
00:10:06,882 --> 00:10:09,674
That must be very exciting for you.

180
00:10:09,853 --> 00:10:12,805
Yes, I'm sure. Why do we need
any changes at all?

181
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:16,091
I mean, this is the best
private school in Boston.

182
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,278
- Ja, ja.
- Let him talk!

183
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,555
The Melcher method involves
the education of the whole child--

184
00:10:23,658 --> 00:10:25,483
Mind and body.

185
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:29,210
Ja, when a child fails,
is it just the brain that fails?

186
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,791
Nein. No, the body contains
the failing brain...

187
00:10:32,792 --> 00:10:38,410
and both are cast into a cruel
world of darkness and despair...

188
00:10:38,561 --> 00:10:40,627
and even worse--

189
00:10:41,461 --> 00:10:42,860
Public school.

190
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:44,646
- Oh, oh, right.
- Public school?

191
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:47,718
Dante's inferno of mediocrity.

192
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:54,843
Which is why I bring with me
two of my most valued associates.

193
00:10:55,078 --> 00:10:58,233
We have mind and body.

194
00:10:58,674 --> 00:10:59,951
Ja. Ja.

195
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:03,214
Miss Donovan
will hone your children's minds.

196
00:11:03,626 --> 00:11:06,776
And Mr. Brewer, he will craft
your children's bodies...

197
00:11:06,777 --> 00:11:12,211
into the proper mind-vessels
through exercise and nutrition.

198
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:16,267
And any questions?

199
00:11:28,451 --> 00:11:31,502
Open floor plan.
3,200 square feet.

200
00:11:31,503 --> 00:11:35,106
Uh, panoramic views of the park
and the Charles.

201
00:11:35,187 --> 00:11:38,913
Uh, there's a fitness center,
a rooftop pool...

202
00:11:38,914 --> 00:11:43,381
uh, concierge service.
It's the perfect newlywed apartment.

203
00:11:43,382 --> 00:11:47,407
Oh, it's-- the place,
it's fantastical.

204
00:11:47,538 --> 00:11:51,124
- What do you think, Binky?
- It's a little small.

205
00:11:51,368 --> 00:11:55,530
The- the apartment, Binky.
What do you think of the apartment?

206
00:11:56,305 --> 00:11:59,581
We'll take it.
She-- She loves air.

207
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:03,178
Hardison and Parker are all set.
Now all we got to do is, uh...

208
00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:06,250
give Widmark a triumph
worthy of a day pass.

209
00:12:06,335 --> 00:12:07,900
A triumph?
In what?

210
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:11,046
I mean, in five years, this kid hasn't joined
a club, he hasn't played a sport.

211
00:12:11,047 --> 00:12:14,216
I've got to be honest with you. I don't know
how I feel about using a kid to get to a Mark.

212
00:12:14,217 --> 00:12:16,729
We're not using him. I mean,
every kid is good at something.

213
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,298
You know, we just got to draw Widmark out.
Give him his moment to shine.

214
00:12:20,299 --> 00:12:23,022
Oh, so, we'd be like
his fairy godparents.

215
00:12:23,032 --> 00:12:26,785
Exactly. And, I mean, come on.
Look at this. Cushy private school.

216
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:29,358
No gunrunners, mob bosses, Interpol.

217
00:12:29,359 --> 00:12:30,645
This is a breeze.

218
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:34,099
We've got one week before
the clinic closes for good.

219
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,602
Athletics. Academics. Let's go get
Widmark the win. All right?

220
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,045
All right, Widmark.
Get on the line. You're up.

221
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:45,954
Yeah, you're up. Get on the line.
Show them what you got, man.

222
00:12:45,955 --> 00:12:47,449
I got this...

223
00:12:47,796 --> 00:12:50,165
Hey. You.
Take your helmet off.

224
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:52,021
- What's your name?
- Skyler Sanford.

225
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:54,395
- Sky... Skyler?
- Yeah.

226
00:12:54,396 --> 00:12:57,671
Is that a boy's name?
Don't do that again.

227
00:12:57,672 --> 00:12:59,695
Put your hat on.
You're up against Wid--

228
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,845
I said get out there, man.
Get out here.

229
00:13:01,846 --> 00:13:03,339
All right.

230
00:13:06,187 --> 00:13:08,552
What are you doing, man?
What are you doing?

231
00:13:08,553 --> 00:13:10,924
Don't laugh!
What are you doing?

232
00:13:11,121 --> 00:13:13,454
There's girls here.
You're better than that.

233
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:15,435
Turn your hat around.

234
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:19,708
All right.

235
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,612
Here we go.

236
00:13:24,165 --> 00:13:26,409
En garde.
Fence!

237
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:40,253
Next week is the state spelling bee,
and we're going to be sending...

238
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:42,488
a representative
from right here in Dalton.

239
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,638
Now, I've chosen the best spellers
from every class to compete in the tryouts.

240
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:50,858
The winners will compete in
a school-wide competition next Friday.

241
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:55,265
Your parents are gonna be there--
It is gonna be huge. Let's get started!

242
00:13:55,359 --> 00:13:57,715
Widmark-- food.

243
00:13:57,964 --> 00:13:58,886
Food.

244
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,349
F-O-O-D.

245
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,043
Food.

246
00:14:05,884 --> 00:14:07,555
Pseudosyllogism.

247
00:14:08,318 --> 00:14:11,623
- That's not fair. He got "food"!
- Uh-uh-uh. Skyler...

248
00:14:11,624 --> 00:14:15,524
I can assure you that the order
of these cards is entirely random.

249
00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:16,974
Pseudosyllogism.

250
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,396
Um...
Pseudosyllogism. S-

251
00:14:22,889 --> 00:14:24,207
Whatever.

252
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,851
Chylocaulous.

253
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,095
Chylocaulous.

254
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:35,052
C-H-Y-L-O...

255
00:14:35,053 --> 00:14:37,224
C-A-U-L-O-U-S.

256
00:14:37,365 --> 00:14:38,689
Chylocaulous.

257
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,760
That's impressive.

258
00:14:42,896 --> 00:14:44,014
Sunset.

259
00:14:45,051 --> 00:14:46,170
Sunset.

260
00:14:46,564 --> 00:14:48,640
- S-U-N...
- Ribonucleic.

261
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,174
Ribonucleic.

262
00:14:50,315 --> 00:14:53,299
R-I-B-O-N-U-C-L...

263
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,970
- E-I-C.
- Wildfire.

264
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:58,003
W-I-L...

265
00:14:58,004 --> 00:14:59,434
- D...
- Flibbertigibbet.

266
00:14:59,435 --> 00:15:01,586
F-L-I-B-B-E-R...

267
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,363
T-I-G-I-B-B-E-T.

268
00:15:03,364 --> 00:15:05,287
- Bicycle.
- B-I...

269
00:15:05,955 --> 00:15:07,330
S-I...

270
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:10,019
C-L-E.
Bicycle?

271
00:15:10,556 --> 00:15:14,209
- Antidisestablishmentarianism.
- A-N-T-I...

272
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:18,239
D-I-S-E-S-T-A-B-L-I-S-H...

273
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,854
M-E-N-T-A-R-I-A-N-I-S-M.

274
00:15:21,979 --> 00:15:25,260
Antidisestablishmentarianism.

275
00:15:25,497 --> 00:15:27,930
Congratulations, Ms. Kim.

276
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,367
Class dismissed.

277
00:15:39,464 --> 00:15:41,943
Hey, Widmark.
Good job.

278
00:15:42,282 --> 00:15:45,376
- I just got lucky with the words you gave me.
- Mnh-mnh. Be proud of yourself.

279
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:47,478
The important thing is you tried.

280
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:50,454
I try hard.
All the time, but...

281
00:15:50,952 --> 00:15:53,900
no matter how much I want
something, it never happens.

282
00:15:53,901 --> 00:15:57,224
Oh, sweetie.
What-- what do you want?

283
00:15:57,225 --> 00:15:59,331
I don't know.
I just...

284
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:02,702
I want someone to like me.

285
00:16:04,176 --> 00:16:06,438
Does that get easier
when you're a grown-up?

286
00:16:06,439 --> 00:16:08,326
Um... no.

287
00:16:09,023 --> 00:16:10,873
I don't think it does.

288
00:16:11,352 --> 00:16:13,973
You're nice.
But weird.

289
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:17,284
All right, go on.
You're late for class.

290
00:16:19,773 --> 00:16:21,378
Stop moving!

291
00:16:22,759 --> 00:16:25,162
Look-- it don't have to be exact.

292
00:16:25,247 --> 00:16:28,116
Woman, it's a motion detector.
Just point it that way.

293
00:16:28,117 --> 00:16:29,845
Watch out...

294
00:16:43,048 --> 00:16:44,640
What the hell do you guys want?

295
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:49,073
Well, we're having a problem
with the signal from camera two again.

296
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:00,479
Hey! FBI!
Drop the gun!

297
00:17:07,163 --> 00:17:08,663
Special Agent Hagen?

298
00:17:09,909 --> 00:17:11,792
It's me. McSweeten.

299
00:17:12,008 --> 00:17:14,427
Todd, from the Moscone
mob case last year?

300
00:17:14,428 --> 00:17:16,389
Oh.
Yeah!

301
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,645
- I lost--
- You dropped this.

302
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:22,034
Yeah.

303
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:24,787
I- I didn't even realize.
Yes, I dropped it.

304
00:17:24,788 --> 00:17:28,695
- Agent Thomas, good to see you again.
- Right back at you. Um...

305
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:31,688
- Taggert from the Moscone case.
- R- right.

306
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,313
Right. Right. So, uh,
what you all been up to?

307
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:38,653
Well, actually, we've had
a pretty good run of it lately.

308
00:17:38,654 --> 00:17:40,287
- Closed some big cases.
- Big.

309
00:17:40,288 --> 00:17:42,938
- Moscone, for one.
- Moscone, no more-ne.

310
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:45,480
We also shut down
a huge meth ring in California...

311
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:47,255
during a bank robbery.

312
00:17:47,414 --> 00:17:49,725
What are you guys doing here?

313
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:52,929
I mean, we--
We're undercover, man.

314
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:56,375
Yeah, yeah. More manpower
on the Fowler case.

315
00:17:56,548 --> 00:17:58,961
- Oh, well, we never have been notified--
- They never said anything about--

316
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:00,712
We're your secret backup.

317
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:03,451
- Well... that's great!
- Hey! That's good.

318
00:18:03,452 --> 00:18:05,320
Shh! Secret!

319
00:18:07,374 --> 00:18:10,651
So, me and you--
You, I-- us--

320
00:18:10,652 --> 00:18:13,187
We should resume surveillance.

321
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,323
Fellas.

322
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:21,140
Can you imagine having
her for a partner?

323
00:18:23,009 --> 00:18:24,014
What?

324
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,950
- You want to see other partners?
- I didn't say that.

325
00:18:28,099 --> 00:18:30,175
- Yeah. Fine. Whatever.
- That's not what I meant!

326
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:33,250
Let me just g- get this straight,
okay. All right, you two--

327
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:35,815
You couldn't rig a gym class
or a spelling bee?

328
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:39,694
And you two-- you run into the only FBI
agents on the planet that recognize you?

329
00:18:39,695 --> 00:18:43,048
I got to be honest with you.
I think we broke the kid even more.

330
00:18:43,049 --> 00:18:45,956
We are the worst
fairy godparents in the world.

331
00:18:45,957 --> 00:18:50,215
Uh, listen, we still got to get Fowler
out of the apartment so we can get in.

332
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:52,966
Yeah, except now when he leaves,
there will be somebody waiting to kill him.

333
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:56,717
One of his victims wants payback
more than he wants to be paid...

334
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:57,735
Back.

335
00:18:57,736 --> 00:18:59,923
One of you two can identify
the gunman, right?

336
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:03,116
Oh, yeah, sure. He stopped and let me take
a picture of him as I was chasing him.

337
00:19:03,117 --> 00:19:06,185
Hey, you know what, man? I've been around little
kids all day. I don't need to come home...

338
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,157
- and do all this crap.
- Hey, man, with all that?

339
00:19:08,158 --> 00:19:11,151
I've been in this pink shirt and these
tight plaid pants, these old webster loafers...

340
00:19:11,152 --> 00:19:13,188
This girl is walking on my back.
I don't need this, man.

341
00:19:13,189 --> 00:19:14,914
Is this the guy?

342
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,745
See?

343
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,392
Wow. I didn't know you could do that.

344
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,820
I thought everybody could do that.

345
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:27,141
Okay. All right, all right.
We'll keep an eye on him.

346
00:19:27,142 --> 00:19:31,035
In the meantime, if they think
you're real FBI, be real FBI.

347
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:33,138
I mean, use it to case the apartment.

348
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:37,013
All right, so I'm out of this, and I'm
on FBI detail with Parker and Hardison.

349
00:19:37,014 --> 00:19:39,249
Actually, no.
I need you to be coach Brewer, so...

350
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,889
There's an armed gunman out there. You want me
in the gym with kids named Skyler and Indigo?

351
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,991
Where did coach Brewer go?

352
00:19:45,992 --> 00:19:49,622
- I mean we are... there
- Shh! Shut up! Shut up!

353
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:57,407
"The play is the thing where in
I'll catch the conscience of a king."

354
00:19:57,408 --> 00:19:59,201
* ...times I'm up *

355
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:02,028
* Sometimes I'm down *

356
00:20:02,485 --> 00:20:05,672
* Ohh, Lord *

357
00:20:06,217 --> 00:20:10,245
* Sometimes I'm almost to the ground *

358
00:20:10,246 --> 00:20:13,496
Sophie, how long would it take
you to stage a musical?

359
00:20:13,616 --> 00:20:15,016
Six weeks.

360
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:16,983
You have two days.

361
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:24,295
* There can be no confusion
that fusion powers the star *

362
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:25,854
D- did...

363
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:30,066
- Did you just make that up on the spot?
- Yes, ma'am.

364
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:34,308
- Huh. You really are quite relentless.
- Thank you, ma'am.

365
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:36,208
M- Miss Donovan?

366
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:39,775
Why are we singing
at a science fair?

367
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:42,170
Ah. Good point, yes.

368
00:20:42,654 --> 00:20:45,274
Science. Knowledge.

369
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:48,412
What is knowledge
without emotional context?

370
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,731
- Facts.
- Uh-uh. Empty. Meaningless.

371
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,032
We're taking left brain--
Science--

372
00:20:53,033 --> 00:20:55,814
And combing it with right brain--
creativity--

373
00:20:55,815 --> 00:20:58,698
To engage the audience's entire brain.

374
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:03,851
Now, just- just present your projects,
and we'll just set it to a little melody.

375
00:21:04,015 --> 00:21:05,011
Who's next?

376
00:21:05,012 --> 00:21:07,614
* I can make a battery out of a potato *

377
00:21:07,615 --> 00:21:08,867
Thank you.

378
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:12,428
- But I can turn on a light bulb.
- Mnh-mnh. That won't be necessary.

379
00:21:12,429 --> 00:21:13,840
Mr. Fowler?

380
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:17,999
* You might find this distasteful *

381
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:20,560
* Or call it just plain gross *

382
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:24,942
* To sing in praise
of bread mold or wonder *

383
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:26,519
* How it grows *

384
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:29,544
* It even makes you crazy *

385
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:33,329
* That mold devours your food *

386
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,683
I don't know what to say, Widmark.

387
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:42,298
- I- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. That was...

388
00:21:42,382 --> 00:21:45,007
That was--
Yes, that was impressive.

389
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:49,322
It was-- It was understated.
It was-- It was potentially wonderful.

390
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,344
Yes!

391
00:21:50,522 --> 00:21:55,225
You, Widmark, are gonna sing
in the grand finale.

392
00:21:55,423 --> 00:21:58,173
Security system installed,
5- camera set-up.

393
00:21:58,174 --> 00:22:02,412
Two in the living room,
entryway, hallway, kitchen.

394
00:22:02,911 --> 00:22:05,420
Could I take a look at your logs
for Fowler's phone calls?

395
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:08,856
I- I mean, if I put in a request
to home office-- It takes forever.

396
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:11,831
Pencil pushers don't understand
what it's like for us out in the field...

397
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:14,755
- face-to-face with crime.
- Yeah, nose-to-nose with evil.

398
00:22:14,756 --> 00:22:16,333
I can hear that.

399
00:22:16,746 --> 00:22:18,875
The files are in here.

400
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:30,122
- Who the hell are you?
- FBI.

401
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:35,081
There are cameras everywhere.
You people don't need to be in here.

402
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:48,893
Out of every kid in the entire school,
she picks him for the showcase performance?

403
00:22:48,894 --> 00:22:51,482
- D- does she even know who he is?
- A student who--

404
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:54,258
Whose father ripped off
everyone in this school.

405
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:57,955
I'm a money manager. I put millions
of my client's accounts with him.

406
00:22:57,956 --> 00:23:01,729
We lost everything. And there isn't a parent
in this school who doesn't have the same story.

407
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:04,644
Ja, it's not our philosophy
to punish the kinder...

408
00:23:04,645 --> 00:23:07,849
for the sins of their parents,
Mr. Sanford.

409
00:23:07,952 --> 00:23:12,160
And Ms. Donovan, she assures me
that Widmark's starring role in the, uh...

410
00:23:12,161 --> 00:23:13,487
The science-sical.

411
00:23:13,488 --> 00:23:16,865
Ja, science-sical--
Is, uh, based solely on merit.

412
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:20,490
Now, if you excuse me, I have
a lot of work to do, please.

413
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:23,212
Good afternoon.
Nice to see you again.

414
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,723
Goodbye. Goodbye.
Goodbye, goodbye.

415
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:33,345
Could you just please try to
maybe not make this so difficult?

416
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:37,117
I can't take you seriously
with that dead cat on your head.

417
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:42,490
Eliot had trouble adjusting, all right?

418
00:23:42,491 --> 00:23:46,291
But he found a way to make his style
work in this setting, so...

419
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,619
Hai! Pain! Honor! Strength!

420
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,624
All right.

421
00:23:57,192 --> 00:23:58,561
Come at me!

422
00:24:01,985 --> 00:24:04,641
It was the best I could manage
under such short notice.

423
00:24:04,642 --> 00:24:07,455
The props are made, the kids have
memorized their presentations.

424
00:24:07,456 --> 00:24:09,820
- I'm just setting it to a bit of music.
- Listen. We-- I mean...

425
00:24:09,821 --> 00:24:12,321
let's not forget why we're here.
Let's not lose focus.

426
00:24:12,322 --> 00:24:15,760
I mean, the object is to get Fowler
out of the apartment, not--

427
00:24:15,761 --> 00:24:18,417
What? Not-- not Widmark.
Right, yeah, I get it.

428
00:24:18,418 --> 00:24:20,627
- He's just the bait.
- Come on. That's not fair.

429
00:24:20,628 --> 00:24:23,819
What's not fair is the way people see him.
His father sees him as a loser...

430
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:26,770
his mother sees him
as this fragile little baby...

431
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:29,930
his schoolmates see him as the boy
whose father stole Christmas.

432
00:24:29,931 --> 00:24:32,746
I just think he--
He-- he...

433
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:34,636
Ohh.

434
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:40,429
I just want people to see him
as he really is.

435
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:43,053
He deserves that.

436
00:24:44,643 --> 00:24:46,226
Everybody does.

437
00:24:57,035 --> 00:24:59,542
This is why we can't have nice things.

438
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:01,934
Rich guys and their crazy
security systems.

439
00:25:01,935 --> 00:25:05,932
Door alarm's got a Takashita 500
with redundant infrared.

440
00:25:06,177 --> 00:25:08,412
- Window's easier.
- The window?

441
00:25:08,413 --> 00:25:12,254
- The window that's 20 stories up?
- Like I said-- easier.

442
00:25:12,618 --> 00:25:17,719
I've done this a million times. All I need
is a pneumatic drill, some diamond bits--

443
00:25:17,861 --> 00:25:19,420
Go, go, go.

444
00:25:22,477 --> 00:25:23,322
Hey.

445
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,346
Hey.

446
00:25:26,609 --> 00:25:29,179
- Oh, uh, thanks.
- What's up?

447
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:32,300
Oh, that one's actually mine.

448
00:25:33,746 --> 00:25:36,272
Uh, I just had my lips on that.
If.. uh...

449
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:39,259
It's like I gave you
a little coffee kiss.

450
00:25:39,794 --> 00:25:42,234
I think your partner is sweet
on McSweeten.

451
00:25:42,235 --> 00:25:44,294
- What? No.
- I dont really talk about this kind of stuff.

452
00:25:44,295 --> 00:25:46,404
No? Well anyway.

453
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,218
Uh, the judge approved
Fowler's day pass...

454
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:52,107
so he can go see some play
his kid is doing at school.

455
00:25:52,108 --> 00:25:54,257
Final-freaking-ly, man!

456
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,250
I- I love the theater.
It's-- "Cats".

457
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:59,837
R- reow!

458
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:03,074
All right, well, see you downstairs
in a couple of minutes.

459
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:05,214
- Um, what?
- You're our backup.

460
00:26:05,215 --> 00:26:08,573
- You're coming along with, right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

461
00:26:08,574 --> 00:26:11,659
- You got our back, right?
- We, we, we-- Jo, yeah.

462
00:26:11,669 --> 00:26:15,253
- We got your back.
- Okay. Good.

463
00:26:18,718 --> 00:26:20,884
Nate, we got a problem...

464
00:26:20,885 --> 00:26:22,640
- Straight in that way.
- Well, so do we.

465
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:26,200
It's final rehearsal, and so far
Widmark hasn't sung a note.

466
00:26:26,497 --> 00:26:28,197
* You *

467
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:31,942
- Shh!
- Hey!

468
00:26:35,744 --> 00:26:38,636
The camera's charged, right?
I don't want to miss a second.

469
00:26:38,637 --> 00:26:41,476
Sir, I'm gonna have to check that bag.

470
00:26:42,312 --> 00:26:45,760
Oh, uh, hey, guys,
can we get a minute?

471
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,296
Look, uh, quick update.

472
00:26:49,306 --> 00:26:52,351
One of us is gonna have to stay upstairs
with the surveillance equipment.

473
00:26:52,352 --> 00:26:53,994
Lucky me.

474
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:56,190
Okay.

475
00:26:57,166 --> 00:27:00,095
Well, we only really need
two agents on Fowler...

476
00:27:00,096 --> 00:27:02,419
so why don't we switch up?

477
00:27:03,082 --> 00:27:06,331
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea.
You know, I could just...

478
00:27:06,332 --> 00:27:08,847
- stay here with Agent Hagen.
- Yeah.

479
00:27:09,091 --> 00:27:10,920
Uh...
You know what?

480
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:14,563
Hagen, you go with the guys.
More manpower for the suspect.

481
00:27:14,564 --> 00:27:16,713
I'll babysit the equipment.

482
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:18,000
Okay.

483
00:27:21,365 --> 00:27:22,688
What are you doing?

484
00:27:22,689 --> 00:27:25,200
Look, Agent McSweetheart
is gonna go wherever you go...

485
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,547
so you got to go to the school,
and I'm just...

486
00:27:27,548 --> 00:27:30,672
just talk me through the break-in.
Talk me-- just...

487
00:27:32,214 --> 00:27:33,463
After you.

488
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:37,106
All that personal space.

489
00:27:38,297 --> 00:27:39,461
Good luck.

490
00:27:41,011 --> 00:27:43,518
Uh, Sophie, are we good to go?

491
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:45,352
Uh, uh...

492
00:27:45,878 --> 00:27:48,842
No, everything's gonna be fine
as soon as I...

493
00:27:49,230 --> 00:27:51,221
find Widmark.

494
00:27:53,859 --> 00:27:56,673
Hardison, what is going on?
What's your status?

495
00:27:56,795 --> 00:27:59,295
I just looped the FBI video feed, so...

496
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:03,645
nobody will see me in the apartment.
Assuming I get in the apartment.

497
00:28:03,975 --> 00:28:05,830
Please take a seat now.

498
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:08,060
Hurry, hurry along.

499
00:28:10,683 --> 00:28:13,594
All right, our man has arrived.
The curtain goes up in five minutes--

500
00:28:13,595 --> 00:28:16,735
One way or the other.
Don't wait for Sophie.

501
00:28:24,022 --> 00:28:25,261
Widmark?

502
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:29,178
Please take a seat now.

503
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:32,543
Hurry, hurry along.
Take your seat.

504
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,425
You sure you can handle this?

505
00:28:36,594 --> 00:28:39,545
Oh, yeah. What's the worst
that can happen?

506
00:28:39,546 --> 00:28:42,483
- Well, you could tangle the lines--
- Hey!

507
00:28:43,477 --> 00:28:46,827
Can you believe they have
a smoothie shop in this place?

508
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,997
- What were you saying?
- Oh...

509
00:28:48,998 --> 00:28:53,627
I was just worried about the play,
and the actors, they cross their lines...

510
00:28:53,628 --> 00:28:56,028
they could really fall on their face.

511
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,332
I'm good! I'm good!

512
00:29:03,417 --> 00:29:04,421
Widmark.

513
00:29:04,647 --> 00:29:06,775
Y- you-- you can't let them win.

514
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:08,991
Y- you can't show them
that they're getting to you.

515
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:11,077
Sophie, no. No.

516
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:13,018
- What?
- Just- just talk to him.

517
00:29:13,019 --> 00:29:16,263
Don't tell him what to do
or who to be. Just talk.

518
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:30,090
Widmark, I'm sorry.

519
00:29:30,881 --> 00:29:31,831
For what?

520
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:34,448
For trying to con you
into being brave, and...

521
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:37,505
that's what I do.
I'm a bloody con artist.

522
00:29:37,787 --> 00:29:43,038
Look, I'm not very good at being honest.
Not even with my friends.

523
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,363
- Do you have a lot of friends?
- No.

524
00:29:56,515 --> 00:29:59,192
No, I--
I never used to have any.

525
00:29:59,285 --> 00:30:02,248
But, um,
now, yes, I- I do.

526
00:30:02,361 --> 00:30:03,507
A few.

527
00:30:05,067 --> 00:30:06,954
I used to have friends.

528
00:30:07,508 --> 00:30:11,178
They don't talk to me anymore.
Because of what my stepdad did.

529
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:13,488
That's got nothing to do with you.
You know that, don't you?

530
00:30:13,489 --> 00:30:16,887
- Then why did they make fun of me?
- Because when they look at you, they see him.

531
00:30:16,888 --> 00:30:20,132
They're not seeing you
for who you really are.

532
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:25,579
How much time do I have left, Parker?

533
00:30:25,813 --> 00:30:28,374
Do you believe in love at first sight?

534
00:30:28,515 --> 00:30:31,758
I believe that when you meet someone,
you have 30 seconds...

535
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,454
before the bells and whistles go off.

536
00:30:34,548 --> 00:30:37,759
Don't be afraid to override
your feelings.

537
00:30:38,629 --> 00:30:39,829
Don't be blue.

538
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:41,835
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Okay. I got you.

539
00:30:41,836 --> 00:30:44,958
On 30 seconds,
"Don't be blue", override--

540
00:30:45,203 --> 00:30:48,230
Wait, uh-- does that mean
cut the blue wire

541
00:30:48,231 --> 00:30:50,380
or don't cut the blue wire, Parker?

542
00:30:50,381 --> 00:30:53,001
That is-- That is so true.
I think you need to be honest--

543
00:30:53,002 --> 00:30:54,258
20 seconds.

544
00:30:54,653 --> 00:30:58,270
It took-- I can't count in 20 seconds
how many blue wires there are.

545
00:30:58,271 --> 00:31:00,592
- Parker, help me out.
- Not following.

546
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:03,593
You just have to cut loose.
Output your feelings.

547
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:06,239
- Snip that blue mood--
- The out-- output?

548
00:31:06,361 --> 00:31:09,104
Output? Okay, I got it.
Gotcha.

549
00:31:11,818 --> 00:31:14,512
Come here, you blue.
Got it.

550
00:31:20,725 --> 00:31:22,631
Daddy's home.

551
00:31:24,732 --> 00:31:27,821
- Did you know I was an actress?
- No.

552
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:30,040
Are you good?

553
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:34,284
Well, others don't seem to think so.

554
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:38,495
Maybe they just can't see you
for who you are.

555
00:31:40,548 --> 00:31:44,322
Do you know what they say about acting?
They say it's about telling the truth, about--

556
00:31:44,323 --> 00:31:48,731
about sharing a little part of yourself
that people don't normally see.

557
00:31:49,003 --> 00:31:52,203
But if you don't-- if you don't
really know yourself...

558
00:31:52,204 --> 00:31:55,108
then they think you're lying.

559
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,605
And...

560
00:31:58,872 --> 00:32:00,768
I think that's my problem.

561
00:32:00,769 --> 00:32:03,319
I've been lying for so long,
that, um...

562
00:32:03,332 --> 00:32:06,201
I don't even know
what the truth is anymore.

563
00:32:06,548 --> 00:32:08,645
I don't want to lie to anybody.

564
00:32:08,942 --> 00:32:09,806
No.

565
00:32:10,477 --> 00:32:13,960
No, you don't have to, Widmark.

566
00:32:14,472 --> 00:32:17,969
What you need to do is you just
have to go out there and be Widmark.

567
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:22,760
Just tell the truth.
Be-- be who you really are.

568
00:32:23,616 --> 00:32:26,601
If you can do that,
then I promise you...

569
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,834
people will believe in you.

570
00:32:36,508 --> 00:32:39,550
Sure is taking them a long time
to get everybody in there.

571
00:32:39,551 --> 00:32:42,882
Yes, a lot longer than I thought.

572
00:32:42,883 --> 00:32:47,971
Excuse me for interrupting prom night
with my annoying felony burglary.

573
00:32:48,337 --> 00:32:51,250
She's ungrateful.
Just ungrateful.

574
00:32:51,251 --> 00:32:52,189
Aha!

575
00:32:55,484 --> 00:32:57,043
Come to pa.

576
00:33:01,841 --> 00:33:05,514
- Widmark okay?
- Guess we're about to find out.

577
00:33:17,154 --> 00:33:19,783
Yeah!
Hacking, rappelling--

578
00:33:19,877 --> 00:33:23,343
Whatever, put me in a dress.
I can do all y'all's jobs.

579
00:33:25,008 --> 00:33:27,703
- It's empty.
- What do you mean it's empty?

580
00:33:27,704 --> 00:33:31,345
I mean it's empty,
like somebody cleaned it out.

581
00:33:36,397 --> 00:33:40,447
I hate to tell you this, but that ain't
our biggest problem right now.

582
00:33:40,498 --> 00:33:42,037
We've got company.

583
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:47,369
* There are many types of clouds *

584
00:33:47,463 --> 00:33:51,078
* Like stratus, cumulus, and nimbus *

585
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:55,209
* Nimbus said to a glum-looking cloud *

586
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:59,228
* Please don't be so cirrus *

587
00:33:59,491 --> 00:34:02,852
* Clouds are high up in the sky *

588
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:05,045
Yeah, but how'd he know
Fowler was gonna be here?

589
00:34:05,046 --> 00:34:07,224
Only ones that knew
were us and the FBI.

590
00:34:07,225 --> 00:34:10,162
Uh, yeah, and Fowler himself.
Maybe we were wrong.

591
00:34:10,163 --> 00:34:12,565
- Maybe Fowler isn't the target.
- Then who?

592
00:34:12,566 --> 00:34:14,424
- What?
- Thank you.

593
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,257
- For this delicious smoothie, Agent.
- Oh.

594
00:34:18,843 --> 00:34:19,811
Um...

595
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:25,918
His FBI handlers.
Fowler's arranged to have them killed.

596
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:28,034
- He's about to run.
- No, there's no way...

597
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:30,664
he could arrange that, man.
He's under house arrest--

598
00:34:30,665 --> 00:34:33,198
No phone calls, no internet.
They're even reading his mail.

599
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,502
- How could he arrange a hit man?
- Let's ask him.

600
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:45,385
- What do you mean you lost it?
- I thought it was in my room.

601
00:34:45,386 --> 00:34:48,258
You thought? Do you have any respect
for your personal property?

602
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:51,245
Do you have any respect for me?
I bought you that cellphone.

603
00:34:51,246 --> 00:34:54,879
Feds confiscated his cellphone.
They didn't take Widmark's.

604
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,680
* You will see in the... *

605
00:34:56,681 --> 00:35:00,035
Fowler's getaway explains the empty safe.
Whatever cash he had on him...

606
00:35:00,036 --> 00:35:02,498
he took with him.
And, uh...

607
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:05,203
I think I know where to look.

608
00:35:10,557 --> 00:35:13,112
Wait. Didn't you search
Fowler before he left?

609
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:17,445
Of course. Nothing on him except
for that camera and some tapes.

610
00:35:18,712 --> 00:35:21,266
Yeah, well,
there's something in that bag.

611
00:35:21,267 --> 00:35:23,196
Where are those tapes?

612
00:35:25,572 --> 00:35:26,792
Thank you...

613
00:35:26,793 --> 00:35:30,844
- Sophie, can you swipe it?
- Mm-hmm. Yes, I'm a little bit busy here.

614
00:35:30,845 --> 00:35:34,579
...Juilliard, for that
wonderful rendition...

615
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,028
of "How Clouds Are Formed".

616
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:44,726
And now we have Milan
with a ballad about photosynthesis.

617
00:35:45,129 --> 00:35:46,369
Enjoy.

618
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:55,211
- Has anybody seen Widmark?
- Sophie, the job's over.

619
00:35:55,212 --> 00:35:58,498
What happens from here on is not
our concern. We have other priorities.

620
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:01,501
No way. No, no. The- the clinic
isn't the only victim here, Nate.

621
00:36:01,502 --> 00:36:05,017
No, I- I didn't prop up this boy
just to see him fail. No way.

622
00:36:05,018 --> 00:36:07,733
I'm not letting that happen.

623
00:36:09,316 --> 00:36:10,884
Yo, what's up?

624
00:36:18,317 --> 00:36:19,829
Uh, Nate--

625
00:36:20,354 --> 00:36:23,449
This phone has sent a bunch of
text messages in the last 48 hours...

626
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,257
to some guy named "Skyler".

627
00:36:25,258 --> 00:36:27,623
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Skyler's a kid at the school.

628
00:36:27,624 --> 00:36:30,818
Why would Fowler be texting
a middle-schooler?

629
00:36:31,326 --> 00:36:34,747
* Photosynthesis is the cause *

630
00:36:34,797 --> 00:36:39,223
* Of this process
that makes things bigger *

631
00:36:42,252 --> 00:36:46,205
He wasn't texting Skyler.
He was texting Skyler's dad.

632
00:36:48,236 --> 00:36:49,879
Uh... sorry.

633
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:54,988
Mark Sanford's an accomplice.
He set up the gunman.

634
00:36:54,989 --> 00:36:57,273
He just traded bags with Fowler.

635
00:37:00,221 --> 00:37:04,466
No, man, why would Sanford help Fowler?
Isn't he one of the guys who invested with him?

636
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:09,458
* Really a gas *

637
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,973
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, no, no.

638
00:37:15,452 --> 00:37:17,255
You're right on time.

639
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:36,313
And now with
"Growth Factors In Bread Mold"...

640
00:37:36,314 --> 00:37:40,529
it's Widmark Fowler!

641
00:37:54,822 --> 00:37:57,451
* You might find this distasteful *

642
00:37:57,545 --> 00:38:00,042
* Or call it just plain gross *

643
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:02,993
* To sing in praise of bread mold *

644
00:38:03,077 --> 00:38:05,997
* Or wonder how it grows *

645
00:38:06,081 --> 00:38:08,551
* It even makes you crazy *

646
00:38:08,635 --> 00:38:12,279
* That mold devours your food *

647
00:38:12,588 --> 00:38:17,392
* Until you find I've changed your mind *

648
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:21,725
* And you see that mold is good *

649
00:38:27,734 --> 00:38:28,860
Shh!

650
00:38:29,405 --> 00:38:33,058
* It's the mushrooms on your pizza *

651
00:38:33,135 --> 00:38:36,544
* It's the yeast
that makes your crust rise *

652
00:38:36,545 --> 00:38:39,513
Well, keep it off the stage!
You're gonna ruin his big finale.

653
00:38:39,514 --> 00:38:40,851
* ...this fun guy *

654
00:38:40,932 --> 00:38:43,744
* That get eaten--
Don't look surprised *

655
00:38:43,745 --> 00:38:46,607
* And while we're on the subject
Who among us *

656
00:38:46,608 --> 00:38:49,176
* Would want the nasty job
that fungus has *

657
00:38:49,177 --> 00:38:51,899
* Scarfing down toxic waste *

658
00:38:52,012 --> 00:38:54,256
* Molds go where they're needed *

659
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:56,918
* So they find our stuff to feed in *

660
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,753
* Molds just want to grow *

661
00:38:58,844 --> 00:39:00,938
* So they pop out spores, you know *

662
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:03,046
* That a mold wants to thrive *

663
00:39:03,047 --> 00:39:05,402
* Needs much more than to survive *

664
00:39:05,486 --> 00:39:08,144
* Because mold's like us *

665
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:15,290
* Just loving our li-fe *

666
00:39:15,374 --> 00:39:17,224
He is competitive.

667
00:39:44,553 --> 00:39:47,032
Uh, Hardison,
are you at your computer?

668
00:39:47,033 --> 00:39:49,448
I need you to check a name for me.

669
00:39:49,964 --> 00:39:51,486
Go ahead.

670
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:53,802
Doug Fineman.

671
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:58,143
And first place goes to
Mr. Widmark Fowler!

672
00:40:01,449 --> 00:40:05,308
Sanford is providing Fowler
with a new identity...

673
00:40:05,712 --> 00:40:08,663
and a new life waiting for him in...

674
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,383
Bogot.

675
00:40:14,008 --> 00:40:16,025
Oh! Coach Brewer!

676
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:18,998
- Shut up!
- I'll take that.

677
00:40:26,189 --> 00:40:27,212
Yes.

678
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:33,442
I'm just saying you can't make
the returns too consistent.

679
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:36,989
10% growth every year,
no matter what the market does?

680
00:40:36,990 --> 00:40:41,353
- The S.E.C. Is going to ask questions.
- Let me worry about the S.E.C., Mark.

681
00:40:41,354 --> 00:40:43,201
But we have to be careful.

682
00:40:43,202 --> 00:40:46,807
My job is to buy off the regulators.
Your job is to bring in new money.

683
00:40:46,808 --> 00:40:51,349
Now, this whole thing goes off
the rails when you stop doing your job.

684
00:40:53,087 --> 00:40:56,038
Where the heck
do you think you're going?

685
00:40:56,967 --> 00:40:59,282
Ja, ja, he, um,
he dropped this.

686
00:40:59,371 --> 00:41:01,994
What is this?
I thought his name was Fowler.

687
00:41:01,995 --> 00:41:03,509
- I don't know.
- Thanks.

688
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,198
- Ja, ja.
- Come on!

689
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:07,833
No! Stop it!
You can't play that!

690
00:41:11,263 --> 00:41:14,493
Now, that...
Is no way to treat a lady.

691
00:41:15,977 --> 00:41:17,200
Come on.

692
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:21,970
- Hi.
- Hey.

693
00:41:22,158 --> 00:41:23,921
Got something for you.

694
00:41:25,142 --> 00:41:27,029
Wow, that is far more than we lost.

695
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,405
Well, you know the $20 million
the feds couldn't find?

696
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:32,337
Fowler had it in an overseas account
using one of his aliases.

697
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:35,960
Yeah, he struck a deal with Sanford.
He traded the tapes for a new passport...

698
00:41:35,961 --> 00:41:39,368
- and two dead FBI guys.
- And our friend Hardison--

699
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:42,600
Well, he liberated some of the cash
so you could use it for your clinic.

700
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:43,301
Wow.

701
00:41:43,302 --> 00:41:46,432
- Hey, Kay!
- Hi, Claudine.

702
00:41:46,902 --> 00:41:50,623
She, um, needed a job
after Fowler went to jail.

703
00:41:51,364 --> 00:41:53,345
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

704
00:41:55,317 --> 00:41:59,234
Well, you know, this is interesting.
This must be a- a first.

705
00:41:59,235 --> 00:42:01,863
I mean, it's the only time
I can remember...

706
00:42:01,864 --> 00:42:05,264
that the con depended solely
on you telling the truth.

707
00:42:05,358 --> 00:42:08,075
- How'd it feel?
- Eh, good.

708
00:42:08,244 --> 00:42:10,644
- Don't get used to it.
- Oh, no. No.

709
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:13,659
I start
telling the truth all day...

710
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:16,413
I stop being Sophie Devereaux.

711
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,306
Maybe that's, uh...

712
00:42:21,851 --> 00:42:23,205
A good thing.

713
