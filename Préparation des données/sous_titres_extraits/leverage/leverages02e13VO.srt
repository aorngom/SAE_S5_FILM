1
00:00:07,733 --> 00:00:09,533
He's telling me something.

2
00:00:10,946 --> 00:00:13,176
I don't know what this means.

3
00:00:14,553 --> 00:00:15,438
What is it?

4
00:00:15,563 --> 00:00:18,868
I'm getting a "B"-sounding name.

5
00:00:21,415 --> 00:00:23,319
Bruce maybe?

6
00:00:24,906 --> 00:00:25,858
Brute?

7
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:27,643
Oh, my god.

8
00:00:27,768 --> 00:00:28,768
Brutus.

9
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:32,698
That's our dog.
Whenever we would come home,

10
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:35,080
Brutus would always run to me first

11
00:00:35,205 --> 00:00:38,617
and Mike would say, "<i>Et tu, Brute?</i>"

12
00:00:40,668 --> 00:00:42,249
We're getting very close now.

13
00:00:42,798 --> 00:00:43,808
Seven months.

14
00:00:44,847 --> 00:00:47,719
Actually, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

15
00:00:47,844 --> 00:00:48,902
Do you think...

16
00:00:50,087 --> 00:00:51,137
Could we...

17
00:00:51,597 --> 00:00:55,596
Could you ask Mike
what we should name him?

18
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:57,823
I don't have to ask him.

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,768
Jodie, he hears you.

20
00:01:01,816 --> 00:01:03,316
He always hears you.

21
00:01:06,432 --> 00:01:09,131
His energy's gone.
I've lost the connection.

22
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:11,208
No, wait. Just ask him...

23
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,031
Perhaps we can try again next week?

24
00:01:23,082 --> 00:01:24,695
He's always with you, you know.

25
00:01:25,512 --> 00:01:26,924
I want you to know that.

26
00:01:28,938 --> 00:01:29,938
Thank you.

27
00:01:33,951 --> 00:01:35,285
Good job on the dog.

28
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:38,367
She had her photos up on facebook.
It wasn't hard to find.

29
00:01:38,918 --> 00:01:40,751
Her most recent bank statement...

30
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:44,575
According to this, she's got about 8000$
left in her joint savings account.

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,015
Well, it's formerly joint.

32
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,465
So we can squeeze another five sessions
out of her tops, before she balks.

33
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:50,985
She's still got the house?

34
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:53,073
She can sell that.

35
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,170
Never leave money
on the table, Wilson.

36
00:01:55,809 --> 00:01:57,773
All right, who's next?

37
00:02:02,186 --> 00:02:04,104
It's been five months
since the accident.

38
00:02:05,471 --> 00:02:08,547
I don't know how to describe it.
It's like she's a zombie.

39
00:02:08,672 --> 00:02:10,327
Everyone grieves in their own way.

40
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:13,311
But she's not dealing with it, Mr. Ford.
He's not letting her.

41
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:19,013
She thinks he's channeling Mike and all
guy's doing is taking her for a ride.

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,539
He ran a credit check on her.
Who does that?

43
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:24,226
People who want your money.

44
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,294
I assume you've shown this to her.

45
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:28,572
I've tried.
She won't listen to me anymore.

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,045
It's like she's been brainwashed
or something.

47
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,026
Belief perseverance. People cling
even tighter to their beliefs

48
00:02:34,151 --> 00:02:36,200
after they've been shown
evidence contradicting them.

49
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:37,573
What am I supposed to do?

50
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:40,367
This guy's taken every penny
from Mike's life-insurance policy.

51
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,490
And now Jodie's talking about putting
her house up on the market next week.

52
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:45,581
Her house.

53
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,917
And the baby's due in two months.

54
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:50,099
- If this keeps up...
- All right, don't worry.

55
00:02:50,596 --> 00:02:52,105
This guy Rand is gonna pay.

56
00:02:52,521 --> 00:02:53,881
We're gonna make sure of that.

57
00:02:54,394 --> 00:02:57,418
I'm not here asking for money,
Mr. Ford.

58
00:02:59,033 --> 00:03:00,554
I just want my sister back.

59
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:06,177
The rich and powerful,
they take what they want.

60
00:03:06,537 --> 00:03:07,978
We steal it back for you.

61
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:15,820
And sometimes, bad guys
make the best good guys.

62
00:03:18,393 --> 00:03:19,490
We provide...

63
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:22,228
leverage!

64
00:03:23,213 --> 00:03:25,863
Welcome to the show.
Okay, go right ahead.

65
00:03:28,197 --> 00:03:29,944
This is where he shoots his show.

66
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:33,170
Surrounded by warehouses
and storage lockers?

67
00:03:33,295 --> 00:03:35,043
Well, it's local cable access.

68
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:36,938
He's self-financing...

69
00:03:37,191 --> 00:03:39,685
Probably trying to score
a bigger payday...

70
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,236
network or something, probably.

71
00:03:42,361 --> 00:03:43,639
<i>You're right about that.</i>

72
00:03:43,807 --> 00:03:45,850
I've hacked Rand's website,
stole his passwords,

73
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:47,476
and accessed his e-mail.

74
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,355
You know, this man has his computer
hooked up to the city's free wi-fi?

75
00:03:52,095 --> 00:03:53,566
<i>My nana could hack this thing.</i>

76
00:03:54,944 --> 00:03:56,443
<i>It looks like there's gonna be</i>

77
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,337
a network scout from wmn
in the audience today.

78
00:03:59,462 --> 00:04:01,448
Sounds like he's trying
to go prime time.

79
00:04:02,113 --> 00:04:05,116
TV show means a control room.
I'll see what I can find.

80
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:18,651
- Who are you hoping comes through?
- Nothing.

81
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:19,884
Nobody.

82
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:21,805
I don't want to talk to anybody.

83
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:23,718
What's wrong?

84
00:04:24,745 --> 00:04:27,004
I just don't like psychics, okay?
They freak me out.

85
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:28,651
Okay, just relax.

86
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:31,343
We're just here to see
what tricks Rand has up his sleeve.

87
00:04:31,468 --> 00:04:32,597
That's all. Just...

88
00:04:45,047 --> 00:04:46,369
Thank you all for coming.

89
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:49,413
I'd like to just jump right in here,
because I'm feeling an energy.

90
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:53,010
It's coming from someone over here.

91
00:04:54,806 --> 00:04:55,901
An "M".

92
00:04:58,829 --> 00:05:00,130
I'm Monica.

93
00:05:01,108 --> 00:05:04,595
I'm getting an "L" name
that connects with you.

94
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:07,306
Lucky. Lucy.

95
00:05:07,888 --> 00:05:08,888
Lucille?

96
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:12,795
It's maternal energy.

97
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,439
Your grandmother, is that right?

98
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,776
You should know
she's very proud of you.

99
00:05:25,027 --> 00:05:28,077
This is not the bathroom, is it?
What's going on, man?

100
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:31,290
- You're not authorized to be in here.
- You're like the wizard.

101
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:34,684
- Sir, you got to go. What is this?
- Like, the guy behind the... All right.

102
00:05:34,809 --> 00:05:36,563
- I said get out.
- All right, man.

103
00:05:36,932 --> 00:05:38,216
Go play with your computer.

104
00:05:38,341 --> 00:05:39,941
I got it wrong. Sorry.

105
00:05:48,309 --> 00:05:49,307
And we're in.

106
00:05:49,952 --> 00:05:51,487
Now we see what they see.

107
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:53,471
What is that smell?

108
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:57,545
What smell? I just washed this thing.
You could eat off the floor.

109
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,339
No, there's definitely a smell.

110
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:02,111
<i>There's someone else
coming through right now.</i>

111
00:06:03,562 --> 00:06:05,114
Is it Fred?

112
00:06:05,545 --> 00:06:07,906
- Or Frank?
- I got a gecko named Frank.

113
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:10,744
He's still alive, though, yeah.

114
00:06:11,091 --> 00:06:13,218
At least he was this morning
when I left.

115
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,360
Are you trying to tell me
something about...

116
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:19,541
It's not a gecko.

117
00:06:22,284 --> 00:06:25,759
You shut yourself off to the energies
that are around us.

118
00:06:26,629 --> 00:06:27,875
But your friend here,

119
00:06:28,389 --> 00:06:29,869
she's a little more receptive.

120
00:06:30,597 --> 00:06:31,597
In fact,

121
00:06:32,156 --> 00:06:34,039
I think I'm getting an energy
right now.

122
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:36,687
It's definitely family.

123
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:41,608
Is it your father?

124
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:43,721
No.

125
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:46,727
No, it's a sibling.

126
00:06:49,482 --> 00:06:50,367
A brother.

127
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:56,206
You were both very young.
It was an accident.

128
00:06:57,548 --> 00:06:58,698
I see a road.

129
00:06:59,777 --> 00:07:01,641
I see a car.

130
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:05,174
But your brother's not in the car.

131
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:07,609
He's in the street.

132
00:07:07,931 --> 00:07:08,931
Wheels.

133
00:07:09,785 --> 00:07:11,055
I see wheels.

134
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,476
A skateboard.

135
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:19,063
A bicycle.

136
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:23,402
Was he riding a bicycle
when he was struck?

137
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:29,281
He's been gone a long time
from you now.

138
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,865
He's sorry that he had to leave you.

139
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:36,511
<i>He knows...</i>

140
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:39,583
<i>that you feel responsible.</i>

141
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:42,690
But he wants you to know
it was an accident.

142
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:46,840
You taught him to ride that bike,
didn't you?

143
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:53,159
That's all right.

144
00:07:53,284 --> 00:07:57,004
Sometimes people just aren't ready
to hear what the spirits have to say.

145
00:08:02,467 --> 00:08:03,467
Damn.

146
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:05,371
He is good.

147
00:08:06,178 --> 00:08:07,627
He should be shot.

148
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,011
There's no way
he could known that stuff.

149
00:08:33,843 --> 00:08:36,452
I've never told anyone.

150
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:38,257
No one.

151
00:08:39,005 --> 00:08:39,810
Ever.

152
00:08:40,262 --> 00:08:42,925
- Parker, he didn't know anything.
- No, Nate.

153
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,621
You said we'd find a trick
up his sleeve.

154
00:08:46,198 --> 00:08:47,714
You said we'd find a trick.

155
00:08:48,462 --> 00:08:50,712
We didn't find a trick, did we?

156
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:53,018
He knew things.

157
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,151
He's really psychic.

158
00:08:55,276 --> 00:08:58,203
He's not a psychic, Parker.
He's just a con man.

159
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:01,135
He just did a cold read on you.
That's all.

160
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,844
He just asked questions and used
your answers to guide him.

161
00:09:03,969 --> 00:09:06,753
- But I didn't say anything.
- You didn't have to.

162
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,380
Can I show you something?

163
00:09:13,547 --> 00:09:15,252
Right there.

164
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,015
Do you remember when he asked you,

165
00:09:18,497 --> 00:09:22,352
"Is this energy that I'm getting does it
have anything to do with your father?"

166
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,671
Do you remember?

167
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,910
Well, you furrowed your eyebrow.

168
00:09:26,228 --> 00:09:28,324
You might as well have told him,
"No."

169
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:30,830
And then, when he keyed
in on your brother...

170
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:31,945
Right here...

171
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:35,365
Your eyes widened just slightly,
so he knew he was on the right track.

172
00:09:35,761 --> 00:09:37,701
And then he just guessed, Parker.

173
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,608
He got a hit when he said
that you were both very young,

174
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,858
and he just went with the odds...

175
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,709
An accident of some kind.

176
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,676
But he knew about the bicycle.

177
00:09:46,801 --> 00:09:47,753
No, he didn't.

178
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:51,565
'cause what happened was,
he said "wheels."

179
00:09:51,823 --> 00:09:54,067
And then he moved on,
and he said "skateboard."

180
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,837
You told him about the bicycle.

181
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:59,213
- No, I didn't say anything.
- You had a certain tell, Parker.

182
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:02,392
Your mouth opened
just a little bit...

183
00:10:02,517 --> 00:10:05,187
Enough for him
to register your surprise.

184
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,862
Then, well, he just guessed.

185
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:11,466
He used all of these things
during the reading...

186
00:10:11,975 --> 00:10:13,346
How your breathing changed,

187
00:10:13,471 --> 00:10:15,770
if your shoulders were raised
or slouched,

188
00:10:15,895 --> 00:10:18,408
how you were holding your hands,
if your lips were pursed.

189
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,553
But what about the other people?
He knew names and relationships.

190
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:22,955
Yeah, the hot read.

191
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,974
What he does is
he researches before the show,

192
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:28,710
gets himself armed with all information
possible to help him with the readings.

193
00:10:29,054 --> 00:10:32,060
It's not really that much
different than what we do.

194
00:10:33,263 --> 00:10:35,910
But he doesn't know who's gonna be
in the audience ahead of time.

195
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,527
Well, no. No, he doesn't.

196
00:10:37,652 --> 00:10:39,846
He doesn't know...
until they're there.

197
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,303
He's got cameras all over the place
hoping to pick up something,

198
00:10:43,428 --> 00:10:46,012
hear something
that's gonna help him in the reading.

199
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:47,911
He also has a plant.
He's got an assistant

200
00:10:48,036 --> 00:10:50,259
who stands in line and pretends
to be part of the audience.

201
00:10:50,384 --> 00:10:54,382
I can't explain it, but sometimes
it feels like he's still around.

202
00:10:54,602 --> 00:10:57,146
I know what you mean.
My mom died a few months ago.

203
00:10:57,356 --> 00:10:58,361
Heart attack.

204
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:03,090
<i>I'm just hoping Mr. Rand
can make contact with her,</i>

205
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:05,970
- <i>Find out if she hears me.</i>
- And that person

206
00:11:06,095 --> 00:11:09,359
feeds him the information
about the readings in his ear

207
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:11,524
using earbuds just like we do.

208
00:11:13,406 --> 00:11:15,424
First one up is Monica.

209
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,052
She's here to speak
to her grandmother Lucille.

210
00:11:18,406 --> 00:11:19,678
She's sitting on your left.

211
00:11:20,544 --> 00:11:21,731
Your other left.

212
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,094
Guys, there's like...

213
00:11:26,236 --> 00:11:28,118
a dozen hidden cameras

214
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:30,600
and the bug Eliot planted
in the control room.

215
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:33,044
I got audio feeds off
of 20 hidden microphones

216
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:35,256
that were taped to the chairs
in the audience.

217
00:11:35,381 --> 00:11:39,003
I got names, people they wanted
to contact, dates.

218
00:11:39,128 --> 00:11:42,207
And that is what Rand
has hidden up his sleeve.

219
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,077
So, what do we do now?

220
00:11:44,668 --> 00:11:46,018
Cut off his arms.

221
00:11:47,070 --> 00:11:47,998
And his head.

222
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,961
I want to kill him.
Can we make that happen?

223
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:57,201
I can...
I mean, I could...

224
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:59,259
Or we could give him
exactly what he wants.

225
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:03,441
And then make the world think that he's
the greatest psychic that ever lived.

226
00:12:03,566 --> 00:12:06,183
And then, in front of the network
and his audience,

227
00:12:06,351 --> 00:12:07,809
we destroy him.

228
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:10,604
How do we do that?

229
00:12:11,642 --> 00:12:13,492
We go and steal the future.

230
00:12:18,553 --> 00:12:20,351
Even move to LA if you want.

231
00:12:20,476 --> 00:12:22,263
Mr. Rand, I don't doubt your gift,

232
00:12:22,388 --> 00:12:24,655
but it's nothing we haven't seen before
on television.

233
00:12:24,975 --> 00:12:26,961
And I got an e-mail
from the network this morning.

234
00:12:27,086 --> 00:12:29,184
The audience for psychic shows
is leveling off.

235
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:32,678
I can't justify picking you up unless
I see something truly unbelievable.

236
00:12:32,803 --> 00:12:35,607
Let me set up a special taping

237
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:38,340
to show you exactly
what I'm capable of.

238
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,468
Although going deeper into the void
is a little dangerous,

239
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:43,595
I'm willing to do it if you are.

240
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:50,927
Mr. Rand, I got to talk to you.

241
00:12:51,052 --> 00:12:53,599
About what? That show?
It was a disaster.

242
00:12:53,724 --> 00:12:55,930
I need more,
more things on more people.

243
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:58,152
Real facts...
things that only the dead would know!

244
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,910
I've already replaced all the equipment.
upgraded all of our microphones.

245
00:13:01,035 --> 00:13:02,468
I could put more plants,

246
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:05,048
but if the questions get more explicit,
they could give us away.

247
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:07,274
I had to cold-read half
that audience in there.

248
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:09,703
You're always saying how you never
get to practice cold reads.

249
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:12,582
Not live! Not in front
of the network suits, you idiot.

250
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,668
But, sir, you were amazing.

251
00:13:15,507 --> 00:13:18,492
The way you used that rainbow ruse
and the russian doll.

252
00:13:18,617 --> 00:13:21,216
You had them eating out of your hand.
I've never seen anything like it.

253
00:13:22,056 --> 00:13:23,730
You want to know what the trick is?

254
00:13:24,657 --> 00:13:25,857
It's confidence.

255
00:13:27,024 --> 00:13:29,516
You believe what you're saying,
and they'll believe it, too.

256
00:13:29,973 --> 00:13:31,562
It doesn't matter how many misses,

257
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:33,520
'cause it's the hits
that they'll remember.

258
00:13:33,911 --> 00:13:34,753
Yes, sir.

259
00:13:35,409 --> 00:13:36,409
All right.

260
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:39,813
So, what do we have scheduled
for the rest of the day?

261
00:13:39,938 --> 00:13:42,197
That's what I wanted to talk
to you about. We've actually...

262
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:43,780
had some cancellations.

263
00:13:44,061 --> 00:13:45,148
Cancellations?

264
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:48,368
- Did they give a reason?
- The same reason, actually.

265
00:14:03,864 --> 00:14:04,884
Here he comes.

266
00:14:05,165 --> 00:14:06,371
Just incredible.

267
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:08,748
Here, let me give you something
for all you've given me.

268
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,518
Please, you know
I can't accept that.

269
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:13,393
You know, I always thought
you guys were fakes.

270
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,366
- I saw this one guy the other night...
- That's not why I do this.

271
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,640
You sure?

272
00:14:25,284 --> 00:14:26,948
How may the spirits serve you today?

273
00:14:27,478 --> 00:14:31,400
Maybe they can explain why you keep...
poaching my clients.

274
00:14:34,205 --> 00:14:37,464
I must apologize, Mr. Rand.
It's true I've had more visitors lately,

275
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:39,459
but I had no idea it was
at your expense.

276
00:14:40,097 --> 00:14:41,850
I'm Bethany. Bethany Noble.

277
00:14:43,502 --> 00:14:46,181
The outfit is a little on the nose,

278
00:14:46,306 --> 00:14:49,846
but other than that, I got to say,
I find your shtick amusing.

279
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:50,972
I'm sorry?

280
00:14:51,097 --> 00:14:52,540
Working out of a coffee shop?

281
00:14:52,665 --> 00:14:53,767
No neon lights.

282
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:56,568
No tarot cards or ouija boards.

283
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:00,524
So, what's your story?
You got me curious.

284
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:04,474
Two years ago, I was diagnosed
with a brain tumor.

285
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,938
The doctors removed it,
but ever since...

286
00:15:08,436 --> 00:15:10,391
I guess you could say
I was twice blessed...

287
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:13,036
with renewed life
and with this gift.

288
00:15:13,643 --> 00:15:14,704
You're serious.

289
00:15:19,275 --> 00:15:20,460
Do you feel the scar?

290
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,032
All right, then.

291
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:28,969
Tell me something
that only the spirits would know.

292
00:15:29,744 --> 00:15:32,430
Tell me about my father...
How he died.

293
00:15:36,328 --> 00:15:37,901
Don't worry. I got you, girl.

294
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:40,823
We didn't give her that scar,
did we?

295
00:15:40,948 --> 00:15:42,023
No, we did not.

296
00:15:45,113 --> 00:15:46,764
I could channel your father,
Mr. Rand,

297
00:15:46,889 --> 00:15:49,062
but that might be difficult,
seeing how he's still alive.

298
00:15:49,975 --> 00:15:51,449
Indiana, isn't it?

299
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:54,749
Do you still have the prayer book
he gave you?

300
00:15:57,326 --> 00:15:58,415
What's wrong?

301
00:15:59,837 --> 00:16:01,126
I felt something.

302
00:16:01,576 --> 00:16:04,137
Nate had me rig the table
with a mild electrical current.

303
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:07,257
- You electrocuted him?
- Yes, I did. It helps sell the bit.

304
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,194
- I approve.
- Thanks, Parker.

305
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:11,539
No. Her agreeing with you
is not a good thing.

306
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:13,413
- That's...
- Thanks.

307
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:17,267
You saw through a trick question.
Doesn't mean anything.

308
00:16:17,819 --> 00:16:20,937
I'm a known commodity in this city.
You could've looked me up.

309
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:26,336
The spirits are all around us,
watching us, guiding us.

310
00:16:27,085 --> 00:16:30,113
I don't need to look people up.
The spirits tell me all I need to know.

311
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:31,731
You're clairvoyant.

312
00:16:32,093 --> 00:16:33,976
They're clairvoyant. I just listen.

313
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:35,535
What do they say about me?

314
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:38,008
You want to know your future.

315
00:16:46,690 --> 00:16:48,698
They're calling you
by a different name.

316
00:16:49,963 --> 00:16:51,468
Do you know the way, José?

317
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:52,465
What?

318
00:16:52,754 --> 00:16:55,621
They're saying José doesn't pay
his tickets and it will burn him.

319
00:16:56,672 --> 00:16:58,808
Don't ask the officer for help.
He has his own problems.

320
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,072
But don't worry, you're the life
of the party, so celebrate.

321
00:17:02,197 --> 00:17:04,996
And bring extra cash
because you won't have enough.

322
00:17:06,681 --> 00:17:09,748
A day late, a dollar short,
and if you don't look both ways,

323
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:11,693
you'll never live to see tomorrow.

324
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:16,025
Listen, I think I've heard enough.

325
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:17,948
Lady, I love your act,

326
00:17:18,073 --> 00:17:20,664
I really do, and I wish you
all the best with it.

327
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:22,850
This is my turf.

328
00:17:23,115 --> 00:17:24,128
Stay off it.

329
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,719
I got a misto here for José.

330
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:38,348
They're calling you by a different name.
Do you know the way, José?

331
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:41,134
I think that's supposed to be mine.

332
00:17:56,330 --> 00:17:58,034
I paid all my tickets!

333
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:01,579
They're saying José
doesn't pay his tickets.

334
00:18:09,452 --> 00:18:12,495
Mr. Rand, your 12:00's here.
It's a new client. I think he's...

335
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,029
I'll handle it.

336
00:18:22,809 --> 00:18:25,771
- How can I help you today?
- Actually, this is...

337
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,656
This is kind of embarrassing.

338
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:30,525
The guys would kill me
if they knew I was here.

339
00:18:33,131 --> 00:18:35,488
Don't ask the officer for help.
He has his own problems.

340
00:18:37,474 --> 00:18:38,474
Officer.

341
00:18:39,031 --> 00:18:41,307
You're a police officer.

342
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:43,178
How did you know that?

343
00:18:43,303 --> 00:18:45,408
Right. Because you're...

344
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:04,142
You're the life of the party,
so celebrate,

345
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,312
and bring extra cash
because you won't have enough.

346
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,358
And if you don't look both ways,

347
00:19:21,483 --> 00:19:23,328
you'll never live to see tomorrow.

348
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:54,664
Have you been here all night?

349
00:19:55,509 --> 00:19:56,319
Bethany.

350
00:19:57,192 --> 00:20:00,226
It happened. All of it happened
just like you said it would.

351
00:20:00,739 --> 00:20:01,829
How do you do it?

352
00:20:02,247 --> 00:20:06,162
I'm just a conduit. I don't do anything.
I simply speak what's on their minds.

353
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,747
You got to come to work for me.

354
00:20:08,532 --> 00:20:10,750
My gift is just that...
It's a gift.

355
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,157
It's meant to be shared,
not bought and sold.

356
00:20:13,783 --> 00:20:17,006
And you're a charlatan, Mr. Rand.
I can't be a part of that.

357
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:19,859
No, no. See, I did my homework.

358
00:20:20,339 --> 00:20:21,302
You need me...

359
00:20:21,885 --> 00:20:23,392
Just as much as I need you.

360
00:20:23,517 --> 00:20:25,974
You're in debt up to your ears.
You got no steady stream of income.

361
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:28,017
You will never pay off
those hospital bills.

362
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,641
How did you get my credit report?

363
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:42,198
It doesn't matter. What matters
is you and I we can help people.

364
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:46,697
You want to use my gift to make you
famous. How is that helping people?

365
00:20:46,822 --> 00:20:47,855
Come on!

366
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,186
It's just for a little while,

367
00:20:50,311 --> 00:20:51,833
till you get back on your feet.

368
00:20:55,139 --> 00:20:57,389
- It would only be temporary.
- Absolutely

369
00:20:59,076 --> 00:21:00,108
Only...

370
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,468
You got to tell me something.

371
00:21:03,764 --> 00:21:05,221
How do you do it?

372
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:06,598
Honestly.

373
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:18,943
I paid all my tickets!

374
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,111
I paid 'em!

375
00:21:36,917 --> 00:21:38,264
The truth is,

376
00:21:38,616 --> 00:21:40,362
I have a lot of help.

377
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,038
Mr. Rand.

378
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:50,358
I thought you said no one
else was allowed in here.

379
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:51,908
Change of plans, Wilson.

380
00:21:52,471 --> 00:21:54,771
You're out.
Ms. Noble will be taking over from here.

381
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:58,858
- I don't understand.
- I need you outside.

382
00:21:59,326 --> 00:22:00,597
Go work the line.

383
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:09,035
- This doesn't feel right. I should go.
- Because of Wilson?

384
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,281
Bethany, the Wilsons of the world...

385
00:22:11,406 --> 00:22:14,063
They serve their purpose,
but you and I... we are special.

386
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:16,042
We're gonna do something great.

387
00:22:16,853 --> 00:22:17,628
Here.

388
00:22:24,781 --> 00:22:26,225
What do you want me to do?

389
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,223
Okay,

390
00:22:27,517 --> 00:22:28,554
this microphone

391
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:30,983
connects to my earpiece.
Now, you

392
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:33,476
look in the audience,
tell me who to talk to.

393
00:22:34,259 --> 00:22:35,480
Use your gift.

394
00:22:35,906 --> 00:22:39,229
When I connect with their loved ones,
you want me to tell you what they say?

395
00:22:39,487 --> 00:22:43,315
You tell me, I communicate it to them.
See, that's my gift.

396
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,561
Relax.

397
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,357
It's just a trial run.

398
00:22:47,651 --> 00:22:48,754
If we do well,

399
00:22:49,095 --> 00:22:51,795
in a little while,
we'll perform live for the network.

400
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:58,913
Okay, you ready?

401
00:22:59,038 --> 00:23:01,713
You do realize what you're asking
me to do is impossible, right?

402
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:03,589
There you go.

403
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:06,134
And my gummy frogs.
I need my gummy frogs.

404
00:23:06,536 --> 00:23:07,427
You serious?

405
00:23:07,745 --> 00:23:08,626
Yeah.

406
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,480
Okay, Parker, how's the harvest?

407
00:23:20,077 --> 00:23:21,228
Excuse me.

408
00:23:22,848 --> 00:23:25,513
Hi. There's no food or drink
in the auditorium, miss.

409
00:23:26,135 --> 00:23:27,579
- Sorry.
- Thanks.

410
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,783
I can only get one wallet at a time

411
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,744
Because someone is
making me return them.

412
00:23:32,912 --> 00:23:35,345
I still don't get why we're
not just making this guy dead.

413
00:23:36,109 --> 00:23:38,422
<i>Yeah, well,
that's why you're on wallet detail.</i>

414
00:23:41,114 --> 00:23:43,180
Okay, guys, show's about to begin.
Tara,

415
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:44,380
it's on you.

416
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:45,775
Got it.

417
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:48,009
<i>The people that we've lost...</i>

418
00:23:48,417 --> 00:23:49,932
They are not gone to us.

419
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:52,055
They're on the other side,

420
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,403
and they're trying to
make contact with us,

421
00:23:55,049 --> 00:23:57,518
to guide us, to console us.

422
00:23:57,914 --> 00:24:00,791
And all of us here have,
atne point or another,

423
00:24:01,839 --> 00:24:03,775
Wanted to talk to
them one more time.

424
00:24:04,469 --> 00:24:05,326
Tonight,

425
00:24:05,807 --> 00:24:07,236
we're gonna do just that.

426
00:24:08,694 --> 00:24:09,891
I feel a presence.

427
00:24:10,749 --> 00:24:12,450
Third row, aisle, yellow dress.

428
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:14,869
Third row on the aisle.

429
00:24:15,037 --> 00:24:16,287
Woman in the yellow dress.

430
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:19,874
- Got her.
- Right there.

431
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:23,268
Sandra Kimmel, hairdresser.
Credit score is really low... 580.

432
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:26,075
Last posted statement paint store,
truck rental.

433
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,074
<i>I got a 17-year-old cutlass.</i>

434
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:30,676
There's a breast-cancer ribbon
on the rearview mirror...

435
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:32,977
Bunch of financial
magazines in the back.

436
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:34,151
<i>This presence...</i>

437
00:24:34,276 --> 00:24:36,053
Is someone that you loved very much.

438
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:37,818
- It's...
- Her mother.

439
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:39,018
<i>... Your mother.</i>

440
00:24:39,626 --> 00:24:40,389
Yes.

441
00:24:41,183 --> 00:24:42,814
Breast cancer.
She died last year.

442
00:24:43,884 --> 00:24:45,233
She was taken from you

443
00:24:46,209 --> 00:24:47,401
just last year.

444
00:24:47,771 --> 00:24:48,736
Breast cancer.

445
00:24:49,544 --> 00:24:51,072
Yes, that's right.

446
00:24:51,673 --> 00:24:54,492
Tell her her mother doesn't blame
her for the salon going under.

447
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,759
Your mother...

448
00:24:56,111 --> 00:24:58,746
she knows how much you wanted
your business to succeed.

449
00:24:59,742 --> 00:25:02,125
It was a salon, wasn't it?

450
00:25:04,626 --> 00:25:05,406
Yes.

451
00:25:05,531 --> 00:25:08,600
<i>Her mother also knows How hard she worked
on the painting, the construction.</i>

452
00:25:09,011 --> 00:25:11,794
Your mother says that your whole life,
you never asked for help.

453
00:25:12,416 --> 00:25:13,262
Never.

454
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:16,722
She knows that you built
that salon with your own two hands,

455
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,441
and she's proud of you,
no matter what happens.

456
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,108
<i>I'm feeling another presence.
It's...</i>

457
00:25:28,096 --> 00:25:29,341
<i>It's a man this time.</i>

458
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:32,546
I got a truck...

459
00:25:32,671 --> 00:25:34,742
Michigan plates, covered in mud.

460
00:25:35,363 --> 00:25:36,713
Two suitcases in the back.

461
00:25:36,838 --> 00:25:38,953
He drove all night to get here.
He didn't even check into his hotel.

462
00:25:39,898 --> 00:25:42,665
Ight, big floral arrangement posted
to his credit card a week ago.

463
00:25:42,962 --> 00:25:46,043
He canceled a trip the same day.
Do you know what you're touching?

464
00:25:46,486 --> 00:25:47,837
His father died last week.

465
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:50,848
He got a call from the national
transportation safety board.

466
00:25:50,973 --> 00:25:52,762
It was a private plane.
It went down.

467
00:25:52,887 --> 00:25:55,075
Your father died in
a plane crash last week.

468
00:25:55,756 --> 00:25:56,679
That's right.

469
00:25:57,016 --> 00:25:58,639
<i>- How'd you know?
- He knows...</i>

470
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,434
That you two had your differences,
and he loves you.

471
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,345
But he wants you to be safe.

472
00:26:04,037 --> 00:26:06,985
Driving 10 straight hours
from michigan to get here...

473
00:26:07,386 --> 00:26:08,357
At's not safe.

474
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:10,721
That's my dad.

475
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:21,579
Margaret Kusen parents both deceased

476
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:25,074
over 20 years ago. She hired
a private inveigator last month.

477
00:26:25,497 --> 00:26:26,959
She's not here to talk to anyone.

478
00:26:27,763 --> 00:26:30,379
She wants answers about her husband.

479
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:34,425
The spirits are telling
me one thing...

480
00:26:35,198 --> 00:26:37,011
Your husband is hiding something.

481
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:40,848
I'm sorry. That's all I'm getting.

482
00:26:41,756 --> 00:26:42,684
It's okay.

483
00:26:43,106 --> 00:26:44,691
That's what I wanted to know.

484
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:53,485
And we'll be right back.

485
00:26:59,341 --> 00:27:00,451
She's amazing.

486
00:27:00,774 --> 00:27:02,688
- Is she for real?
- Who cares?

487
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:05,318
Look at these people.
They're eating it up!

488
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,338
She isonna make me a star.

489
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:12,473
- I'm sorry I couldn't give you more.
- More? Are you kidding me?

490
00:27:12,598 --> 00:27:14,363
Save it for the pay-per-view event.

491
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:17,029
I'm telling you... I'm starting
to rethink this network deal.

492
00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:19,427
They'll still come
for the show, right?

493
00:27:19,552 --> 00:27:22,421
Yes, they will come. Are you kidding?
After what you did in there...

494
00:27:22,546 --> 00:27:23,877
Tara, you got company.

495
00:27:24,002 --> 00:27:27,186
... But they are gonna back up the money
truck for you. I can just see it.

496
00:27:35,048 --> 00:27:35,999
Come on.

497
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,002
- You okay?
- Yeah.

498
00:27:54,524 --> 00:27:55,464
Any theories?

499
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,706
Maybe somebody didn't like their psychic
reading.

500
00:27:57,831 --> 00:28:00,218
- Or maybe someone liked it too much.
- What do you mean?

501
00:28:00,343 --> 00:28:01,650
Rand told me it was
the best show he ever did.

502
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:03,681
Everyone was there at
the show to talk to

503
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:06,089
to the dead except that woman
at the end why was she there?

504
00:28:06,214 --> 00:28:07,832
Her husband.
She thinks he's cheating on her.

505
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:10,813
How'd you know that? All I said was
she hired a private investigator.

506
00:28:10,981 --> 00:28:12,815
Married woman in her 40s? She's
not looking for the maltese falcon.

507
00:28:13,579 --> 00:28:15,258
What do we know about this husband?

508
00:28:16,843 --> 00:28:18,821
Here's the guy she came in with.

509
00:28:18,989 --> 00:28:21,282
Let's see what the facial
recognition says about...

510
00:28:22,539 --> 00:28:24,410
Hello. Nickolas Kusen,

511
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:28,000
age 44. He did time in riverview
a few years back for armed robbery.

512
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:30,624
One of the thugs who tried to
grab her had a prison tattoo.

513
00:28:33,629 --> 00:28:35,046
What... Kusen has a secret,

514
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:38,159
And he's gonna kill rand
so he doesn't reveal it?

515
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,548
That'd be good.

516
00:28:39,673 --> 00:28:42,389
You want to kill someone, you don't
get out and throw 'em in a van.

517
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:45,019
- You don't get out of your seat.
- All right, Kusen needs

518
00:28:45,144 --> 00:28:48,642
rand for his psychic abilities.
That's why he was being so secretive

519
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:49,844
around his wife.

520
00:28:49,969 --> 00:28:52,954
Let me get this straight... We did such
a good job of convincing people Rand

521
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,220
was really a psychic
that we got him kidnapped?

522
00:28:55,345 --> 00:28:58,708
Which means we have to find him, rescue
him, and then, you know, take him down.

523
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:00,783
Let's go to work.

524
00:29:11,181 --> 00:29:12,965
It looks like
they're headed east.

525
00:29:15,443 --> 00:29:17,298
Give me some good news
on the financials.

526
00:29:17,627 --> 00:29:20,154
They're all over the place. It's hard to
get a clear picture.

527
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,925
Must be a cash-heavy operation,
probably import/export.

528
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,379
You know that body shop
Kusen pays property taxes on?

529
00:29:25,504 --> 00:29:27,879
- Let me guess... not a body shop?
- It's a parking lot.

530
00:29:28,724 --> 00:29:31,249
I managed to track them as far
as tremont before I lost them,

531
00:29:31,374 --> 00:29:33,667
but they're definitely
somewhere in the north end.

532
00:29:33,928 --> 00:29:35,466
If I had to guess,
I would say they're being...

533
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:36,852
Union wharf?

534
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,569
And I can do you one better.
I've got an address.

535
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:46,784
All right.

536
00:29:47,178 --> 00:29:49,787
I'm gonna be right outside. I can
be there in seconds if you need me.

537
00:29:50,771 --> 00:29:51,957
Let's hope I don't.

538
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,801
Excuse me.

539
00:30:00,987 --> 00:30:01,841
Are you...

540
00:30:02,009 --> 00:30:04,301
Gonna keep him long?
Because we have a show later.

541
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,441
Who are you?

542
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:07,683
She's... With me.

543
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:11,100
M-ms. Noble.
She and I, we work together.

544
00:30:12,078 --> 00:30:14,074
- How'd you find me?
- The spirits told me.

545
00:30:14,199 --> 00:30:15,717
They said you needed my help.

546
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:17,940
<i>You're psychic, too.</i>

547
00:30:20,651 --> 00:30:22,653
Join us, join us.
Get the lady a chair.

548
00:30:23,257 --> 00:30:25,570
As I was, just explaining to Mr.
Rand...

549
00:30:29,453 --> 00:30:31,532
... I have a bit of a problem.

550
00:30:32,641 --> 00:30:36,633
Several years ago, I was involved
in a short-term business venture

551
00:30:36,758 --> 00:30:38,858
with a very high rate of return.

552
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,463
An associate

553
00:30:40,766 --> 00:30:43,776
and I had gone
into this endeavor together,

554
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:47,094
but before we could split the
profits

555
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,762
from our enterprise,

556
00:30:48,939 --> 00:30:51,178
an unfortunate misunderstanding

557
00:30:51,351 --> 00:30:54,781
forced me to spend a few
years in upstate new york.

558
00:30:55,908 --> 00:30:59,606
- Have you ever been there?
- <i>It's beautiful this time of year.</i>

559
00:30:59,777 --> 00:31:02,354
Yeah, it's... it is beautiful.

560
00:31:02,479 --> 00:31:04,064
Beautiful. Gorgeous.

561
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:07,744
Anyway, when I returned to claim

562
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:11,483
what was mine, Mr. Brancato wasn't
particularly forthcoming

563
00:31:11,608 --> 00:31:13,158
With the information.

564
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:15,912
He passed away without revealing...

565
00:31:16,917 --> 00:31:18,067
Its location.

566
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:20,502
And now you see my dilemma.

567
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,847
You robbed a bank,
and you want us to help you find

568
00:31:23,972 --> 00:31:26,122
Where your partner hid the money.

569
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,172
My wife is such

570
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:31,621
a big fan of yours, Mr. Rand.

571
00:31:31,746 --> 00:31:34,237
She seems to think you have a
knack for this sort of thing,

572
00:31:34,362 --> 00:31:35,692
so I hope that's true,

573
00:31:35,817 --> 00:31:38,850
Because this is only
gonna go down two ways.

574
00:31:39,916 --> 00:31:42,605
You don't find the money
and I kill you...

575
00:31:43,256 --> 00:31:46,110
Or you find the money,
and I consider not killing you.

576
00:31:46,282 --> 00:31:47,782
So, what do you say?

577
00:31:53,682 --> 00:31:56,089
At least he's not
cheating on his wife.

578
00:31:56,214 --> 00:31:59,014
Okay, I found his ex-partner,
cesar brancato.

579
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:00,590
His name was on the lease

580
00:32:00,715 --> 00:32:03,615
for that body shop that
kusen supposedly owned.

581
00:32:05,086 --> 00:32:08,801
This guy wants a bag of money? Let's get
him a bag of money. Everybody listen up.

582
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,655
There was a problem...

583
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,323
before the robbery.

584
00:32:15,732 --> 00:32:18,268
You had issues with him.
You didn't trust him.

585
00:32:18,438 --> 00:32:22,388
I don't need to be psychoanalyzed,
Mr. Rand. I can get that at home.

586
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:25,058
Where the hell's my money?!

587
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,650
I'm seeing something.

588
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,308
It's a car, an old car.

589
00:32:35,195 --> 00:32:36,995
I'm walking around it now.

590
00:32:38,129 --> 00:32:40,029
The license plate's missing.

591
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:42,917
It's a chevrolet...
a chevrolet malibu.

592
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,795
That's what he drove a '78 malibu.

593
00:32:45,770 --> 00:32:48,716
If we follow the car,
it'll lead us to the money.

594
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,995
What do you say we go for a ride?

595
00:33:05,959 --> 00:33:07,709
It's in this direction...

596
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:09,862
Over here.

597
00:33:14,723 --> 00:33:15,909
Buy me 10 seconds.

598
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,183
- Are you all right?
- I'm sorry.

599
00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:26,587
Sometimes the visions are...
A little overwhelming.

600
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:29,099
Good to go.

601
00:33:29,548 --> 00:33:30,748
It's this way.

602
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,989
I'll be damned.

603
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,296
Search it.

604
00:34:16,881 --> 00:34:17,845
May I hold it?

605
00:34:22,514 --> 00:34:23,810
You see anything?

606
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,380
What does it open?

607
00:34:26,463 --> 00:34:29,649
I see a storage unit.
Someone's making a deposit on it.

608
00:34:30,254 --> 00:34:32,735
He has a beard... And glasses.

609
00:34:33,183 --> 00:34:35,083
That's him. That's brancato.

610
00:34:36,072 --> 00:34:38,172
I only need the unit for a week.

611
00:34:40,616 --> 00:34:43,038
Are you attached to
those overalls, Phil?

612
00:34:50,883 --> 00:34:51,883
Come on!

613
00:34:56,237 --> 00:34:59,430
- I know this place. We're...
- I need to concentrate.

614
00:34:59,993 --> 00:35:01,793
Which unit does this open?

615
00:35:03,011 --> 00:35:06,361
<i>Guys, we're not ready.</i>
We got to stall. We got to stall.

616
00:35:07,408 --> 00:35:10,860
No, I'm sorry. I've lost my connection
to the spirit world.

617
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:14,993
It's like a car battery.
I just need to recharge.

618
00:35:15,388 --> 00:35:19,081
I've waited long enough.
Come on. Try this one right here.

619
00:35:19,206 --> 00:35:21,206
Take those, get it. Go get it.

620
00:35:22,518 --> 00:35:25,204
What's going on?!
What the heck you doing over here?

621
00:35:25,374 --> 00:35:26,914
I need to see your records.

622
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:35,132
- <i>Just few more minutes, keep them busy.</i>
- Are you guys cops?

623
00:35:35,415 --> 00:35:37,325
Yeah. We're the k-9 unit.

624
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:39,000
The dog ate my badge.

625
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:41,838
Now, which unit does this key open?

626
00:35:42,218 --> 00:35:43,110
Right.

627
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,142
Let's see. I'm gonna have
to check my records.

628
00:35:46,311 --> 00:35:50,261
- Let's look at your records.
- Okay, we're gonna check the records.

629
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:59,781
- We need more boxes.
- And a lot of luck.

630
00:35:59,906 --> 00:36:02,620
Yeah, I think we used all
our luck on finding this place.

631
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,495
Wait. Man, you know what?

632
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:08,519
It ain't luck, okay? Finding the perfect
place to end the treasure hunt

633
00:36:08,644 --> 00:36:11,294
Is a testimony to my
intellectual prowess.

634
00:36:12,705 --> 00:36:14,455
What?
It's baby clothes.

635
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,130
It says "books," man!

636
00:36:16,255 --> 00:36:17,255
Does it?

637
00:36:18,286 --> 00:36:20,761
Not that.
You got to line up the right...

638
00:36:21,054 --> 00:36:22,464
Hey. We're all clear.

639
00:36:22,589 --> 00:36:24,166
... Code with the thing there,

640
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:26,542
And, I think there... yeah!
There we go. It's...

641
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:29,394
That'd be unit number, 398.

642
00:36:32,265 --> 00:36:33,365
Go! Come on!

643
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:39,694
You better hope they find the money.

644
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:43,283
Come on, come on, what's in there?

645
00:36:43,543 --> 00:36:44,952
Keep going. Open that box.

646
00:37:01,697 --> 00:37:03,847
What's your crystal ball say now?

647
00:37:04,795 --> 00:37:05,722
I don't know.

648
00:37:05,972 --> 00:37:07,932
You better go into
a trance or something,

649
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:10,435
Whatever it is you do,
Because I'm fresh out of patience!

650
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,271
I'm not psychic.

651
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:14,824
I can't... I can't
communicate with the dead.

652
00:37:14,949 --> 00:37:17,807
- It's all fake!
- I think you're holding out on me.

653
00:37:17,932 --> 00:37:20,904
I think you know where the money is...
You just want it for yourself!

654
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,277
No. No! It's not...
listen to me.

655
00:37:23,402 --> 00:37:26,480
My studio is wired up with
microphones and cameras.

656
00:37:26,605 --> 00:37:29,162
And I make it look like
I'm a psychic, but I'm not.

657
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,043
You know, I cold-read people.

658
00:37:31,168 --> 00:37:33,993
Yeah, I ask them questions.
I look at their reactions.

659
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:35,388
It's all I do!

660
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:40,007
It's a scam okay?
I've been running it for years!

661
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,385
Have to say, guys,
I totally saw this one coming.

662
00:37:46,321 --> 00:37:49,066
How'd you know I was hiding
something from my wife?

663
00:37:49,191 --> 00:37:50,873
I didn't. She did.

664
00:37:59,141 --> 00:38:00,527
<i>I cold-read people.</i>

665
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,999
<i>Yeah, I ask them questions,
I look at their reactions.</i>

666
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:04,324
<i>It's all I do.</i>

667
00:38:05,886 --> 00:38:09,286
<i>It's a scam okay?</i>
<i>I've been running it for years!</i>

668
00:38:16,628 --> 00:38:20,043
I'm not done piggybacking the signal from
the unit cameras to the live studio feed.

669
00:38:20,168 --> 00:38:23,717
Guys, we're not ready yet.
You got to stall. You got to stall.

670
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:25,647
<i>It's all fake!</i>

671
00:38:25,772 --> 00:38:27,938
<i>You know what I think?
I think you're holding out on me.</i>

672
00:38:28,063 --> 00:38:30,948
<i>I think you know where the money is.</i>
<i>You just want it for yourself!</i>

673
00:38:31,073 --> 00:38:32,950
<i>No! It's not listen to me.</i>

674
00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:36,481
<i>My studio is wired up with microphones
and cameras.</i>

675
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:39,340
<i>And I make it look like I'm
a psychic, but I'm not.</i>

676
00:38:39,465 --> 00:38:41,179
<i>You know, I cold-read people.</i>

677
00:38:41,304 --> 00:38:44,070
<i>Yeah, I ask them questions.
I look at their reactions.</i>

678
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:47,186
<i>It's all I do! It's a scam okay?</i>

679
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:49,828
All right, there he is.
You're under arrest.

680
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:51,858
Hey, you know what?
He's the bad guy here.

681
00:38:51,983 --> 00:38:54,290
When we were in there, he had a
gun on me, and he robbed a bank.

682
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:56,583
Like I'm gonna believe
anything you say.

683
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,962
- Get them out of here!
- Wait, no! Come on! Aw. Not jail.

684
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,721
<i>... Microphones and cameras.</i>

685
00:39:01,846 --> 00:39:04,946
<i>And I make it look like I'm
a psychic, but I'm not.</i>

686
00:39:06,549 --> 00:39:09,221
Okay, you know, I'm getting
a bad feeling about this.

687
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:10,656
Now, really.

688
00:39:22,002 --> 00:39:23,302
Watch your head.

689
00:39:24,688 --> 00:39:27,966
"He who sells miracles will have
the devil knocking at his door."

690
00:39:28,091 --> 00:39:30,242
- What is that, a proverb?
- Fortune cookie.

691
00:39:30,778 --> 00:39:31,601
What?

692
00:39:31,726 --> 00:39:33,370
What? It started with "he who."

693
00:39:34,013 --> 00:39:36,419
They do make a cute pair,
don't they?

694
00:39:36,685 --> 00:39:38,454
Let's see, we got assault,

695
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:41,423
Kidnapping, and burglary
for our iend kusen,

696
00:39:41,548 --> 00:39:45,552
Garden-variety fraud for our
psychic friend, dalton rand.

697
00:39:46,355 --> 00:39:48,172
Any way we can get them
in the same prison?

698
00:39:48,297 --> 00:39:51,697
- That could be arranged.
- Hey, let's go, man. Let's go.

699
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:57,136
All the people who thought he could talk
to their loved ones on the other side.

700
00:39:57,261 --> 00:40:00,090
What's to stop them from falling
for the next dalton rand?

701
00:40:00,215 --> 00:40:01,315
Not a thing.

702
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:04,516
Then why do it?

703
00:40:09,277 --> 00:40:10,627
It's okay, jodie.

704
00:40:11,164 --> 00:40:14,176
I'm sorry. I'm just so embarrassed.

705
00:40:14,301 --> 00:40:16,377
No, no. Don't be.
Dalton rand is a con artist.

706
00:40:16,502 --> 00:40:18,937
He took advantage of hundreds
of people, maybe thousands.

707
00:40:19,062 --> 00:40:22,127
But now that he's heading to jail,
he can't do it to anyone else.

708
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:27,330
There was a part of me that knew
it wasn't real, but I didn't care.

709
00:40:27,455 --> 00:40:29,599
I just missed mike so much.

710
00:40:29,724 --> 00:40:31,874
I wanted to see him again so bad.

711
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,805
<i>You will see him again.</i>

712
00:40:36,224 --> 00:40:37,824
Maybe it'll be a look.

713
00:40:39,157 --> 00:40:40,907
Maybe it'll be a gesture.

714
00:40:41,506 --> 00:40:43,106
Maybe it'll be the way

715
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:46,463
He spreads peanut butter
on a slice of bread.

716
00:40:47,241 --> 00:40:48,956
But when you see it, you'll know,

717
00:40:49,081 --> 00:40:52,142
And you'll say "That's Mike."

718
00:40:54,724 --> 00:40:58,205
And you know what? That's a miracle
that no one could ever sell you.

719
00:41:03,915 --> 00:41:05,415
Thank you, Mr. Ford.

720
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:15,972
And now I see why you do it.

721
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:24,667
Before you go, this is for your sister
and the baby.

722
00:41:30,906 --> 00:41:31,954
What is this?

723
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,586
It's the money rand
took from your sister...

724
00:41:34,711 --> 00:41:35,711
All of it.

725
00:41:36,387 --> 00:41:37,953
I don't know what to say.

726
00:42:01,326 --> 00:42:02,310
Wait a second.

727
00:42:02,564 --> 00:42:05,137
I thought you said all of rand's money
Went into paying for his show.

728
00:42:05,262 --> 00:42:08,150
- I thought you said he was broke.
- It did. He was.

729
00:42:08,782 --> 00:42:10,277
Where'd the money come from?

730
00:42:10,973 --> 00:42:14,239
- Did you guys find the stolen money?
- Did you find kusen's loot?

731
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:16,427
Without...

732
00:42:17,033 --> 00:42:18,183
Unbelievable.

733
00:42:21,814 --> 00:42:24,664
He who looks for hidden
money shall find it...

734
00:42:25,326 --> 00:42:27,693
If he is also a thief.

735
