1
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:18,765
- Thanks for meeting me like this.
- No problem, how could the FBI help?

2
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,978
Alright, the target in this case
I'm working on...

3
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,687
I know he's got the local police
in his pocket and now,

4
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:26,536
I'm pretty sure he's getting tips
from some one inside my department.

5
00:00:26,661 --> 00:00:28,176
I'm gonna need some help here.

6
00:00:28,301 --> 00:00:29,521
Bellbridge?

7
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:31,354
That's the city.

8
00:00:31,566 --> 00:00:33,381
You're doing the right thing,
Lieutenant.

9
00:00:33,614 --> 00:00:35,618
Show Lieutenant Bonanno
our Bellbridge file.

10
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:39,848
Excuse me.

11
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,657
Let's go, let's go!

12
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:48,681
Mrs. Bonanno?

13
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:51,792
I'm Nate Ford.

14
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:54,947
- I just heard.
- I already gave my statement.

15
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:58,663
No, I'm not a policeman.
I'm in the private sector.

16
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,802
Your husband and I are colleagues.

17
00:02:01,216 --> 00:02:03,746
I appreciate your coming down here,
but it's not...

18
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,334
Nate Ford?

19
00:02:07,763 --> 00:02:09,029
He talked about you.

20
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,496
He did?

21
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:13,174
He said you'd help him
with some cases,

22
00:02:13,545 --> 00:02:15,184
and he wanted to buy you a drink...

23
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:17,730
and then arrest you.

24
00:02:19,133 --> 00:02:20,811
I knew he'd figured it out.

25
00:02:21,101 --> 00:02:24,798
Listen, I'd really like to help.
Can you tell me if there are any leads?

26
00:02:25,261 --> 00:02:26,311
No, it's...

27
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,150
It was his day off.

28
00:02:29,707 --> 00:02:32,151
He said he was gonna run an errand
and come right home.

29
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:34,242
Was he working on a case?

30
00:02:34,539 --> 00:02:36,405
Pat never talked about his cases.

31
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:38,391
I'd ask him what he did today,

32
00:02:38,869 --> 00:02:40,627
And he'd open a beer and say,

33
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:42,419
"Wrote a few tickets."

34
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,633
I can't.

35
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:46,374
I'm sorry.

36
00:02:52,635 --> 00:02:54,511
Listen, if there's anything I can...

37
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:00,971
<i>Clear!</i>

38
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,476
<i>It's me. Leave a message.</i>

39
00:03:23,601 --> 00:03:25,752
Sophie, this is the fourth message.

40
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,198
Please call back. The team could
really use you on this one.

41
00:03:29,323 --> 00:03:32,856
It's just, it was a hospital,
And you know, me and hospitals, so...

42
00:03:42,257 --> 00:03:44,007
<i>It's me. Leave a message.</i>

43
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,976
You want a message?

44
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:48,862
Here's a message.

45
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:51,796
You're wasting your time. All right?

46
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:56,166
You don't figure out who you are
by roang the earth,

47
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,066
or hiding in London, you know?

48
00:03:59,191 --> 00:04:00,507
Look, nobody...

49
00:04:00,798 --> 00:04:02,568
Nobody knows who they are.

50
00:04:03,002 --> 00:04:06,150
Nobody knows who they are.
You think you do, and then life...

51
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:08,323
it just...
it tears it out of you,

52
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,815
and you live with that, and...

53
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:15,254
Look, there is no answer.

54
00:04:17,101 --> 00:04:18,757
Everybody else is upstairs.

55
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:30,238
Let's go.

56
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,953
- So, is he gonna be okay?
- They don't know.

57
00:04:40,242 --> 00:04:43,291
- This guy's a cop. You're thieves.
- I'm not a thief!

58
00:04:45,322 --> 00:04:46,202
Bonanno...

59
00:04:46,851 --> 00:04:50,238
is the cop that we tip off
when we need to put the cuffs on a mark.

60
00:04:50,363 --> 00:04:54,001
We're gonna be covering the same ground
as the state cops on this one...

61
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,504
Hundreds of angry,
very highly motivated state cops.

62
00:04:57,672 --> 00:05:00,343
By the way, guys,
whoever shot him up,

63
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:04,472
- was using military-grade weaponry...
- You know what? I don't care!

64
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:06,553
I don't care about that!

65
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,450
This guy dedicated his life
to doing the right thing!

66
00:05:10,788 --> 00:05:14,437
And this is his payback?
His family's pain is what he deserves?

67
00:05:14,562 --> 00:05:17,274
If we don't settle the score on this,
why do we do this?

68
00:05:17,876 --> 00:05:19,024
Do you understand?

69
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,043
What are Bonanno's active files?

70
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,340
According to the state
police database,

71
00:05:38,465 --> 00:05:40,835
Bonanno had half a dozen open cases.

72
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,643
The most recent one was
a protection racket out of Arcadia,

73
00:05:43,768 --> 00:05:46,804
but the cops were focusing
on an auto-theft ring out of Waynesboro.

74
00:05:47,175 --> 00:05:50,606
Let's just say, if you jacked a car
in Massachusetts in the last year,

75
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:53,352
your head's gonna be bouncing off
a cruiser by dinnertime.

76
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,599
- What's that one?
- That's public corruption.

77
00:05:56,724 --> 00:05:58,482
There's practically no files
on that thing.

78
00:06:00,245 --> 00:06:01,068
That's it.

79
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,680
No, these other two files...

80
00:06:03,805 --> 00:06:05,990
They involve violent criminals.

81
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:08,013
This one...
It's government corruption.

82
00:06:08,611 --> 00:06:10,194
That's it. That's it. Just...

83
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,178
check the shooting.

84
00:06:12,524 --> 00:06:13,682
Put up the scene.

85
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:18,252
Okay, so, Bonanno...
he goes to a remote location,

86
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,831
Alone, no backup.

87
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,720
That means he knows his attackers
and he's not expecting any trouble.

88
00:06:22,845 --> 00:06:25,921
What did you just say?
You said no files on it? So, Bonanno...

89
00:06:26,301 --> 00:06:28,762
was keeping this investigation
off the books.

90
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,341
Explains a secret meeting.

91
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,599
Off hours, away from any witnesses.

92
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,467
- Cops are looking in the wrong place.
- Absolutely. So...

93
00:06:35,592 --> 00:06:37,354
that leaves us.

94
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,856
So, who's the bad guy?

95
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,764
Or...
And I'm just spitballing here,

96
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,428
We could just let the state cops
handle this one,

97
00:06:48,553 --> 00:06:50,034
call in an anonymous tip.

98
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:51,910
Come on, Hardison.

99
00:06:52,417 --> 00:06:53,739
How bad could this be?

100
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:57,121
Ladies and gentlemen,

101
00:06:57,381 --> 00:06:58,652
concerned citizens,

102
00:06:58,777 --> 00:07:00,941
businessmen, and community leaders,

103
00:07:01,452 --> 00:07:04,548
I give you the mayor of Belbridge,
Massachusetts,

104
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:05,716
his honor,

105
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:08,116
Brad Culpepper III!

106
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,225
Thank you very much.

107
00:07:15,932 --> 00:07:16,803
Thank you.

108
00:07:18,877 --> 00:07:20,735
Thank you! Thank you.

109
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:23,500
Folks...

110
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:26,654
During my two terms...

111
00:07:28,018 --> 00:07:30,449
we have made a difference together.

112
00:07:30,912 --> 00:07:32,826
High-school test scores
have gone up.

113
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,968
Crime has gone down.
I personally went to Washington DC,

114
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:40,933
and brought back $20 million
of federal 9/11 money

115
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:44,379
to upgrade our ports,
protect us from terrorists.

116
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:50,636
A mayor...
surrounded by security, the press,

117
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:53,685
Probably has half the local cops
on his own private payroll.

118
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,010
Piece of cake.

119
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,934
Explains why Bonanno kept
his investigation a secret.

120
00:07:58,059 --> 00:08:00,714
- Not secret enough.
- Back when I was playing ball...

121
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:02,695
Yes, Judy, I was much thinner then.

122
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:04,983
When I was pitching,

123
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,834
you could not get me off the mound.

124
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:09,867
My daddy taught me
that once I started the game,

125
00:08:09,992 --> 00:08:12,199
by god, I was going to finish it.

126
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,513
Well, I promise you,

127
00:08:14,164 --> 00:08:18,163
if you give me the ball once again,
I will set my sights on the waterfront.

128
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,637
Gone are those decaying shipyards,

129
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:24,998
to be replaced by a sunny esplanade
where families can picnic

130
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:28,048
and our children can run and play.

131
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:33,092
So, what's our angle here?
I haven't been with you guys very long,

132
00:08:33,217 --> 00:08:35,985
But taking someone down for attempted
murder isn't something you normally do.

133
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:38,037
Listen, we come at him
like any other mark.

134
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:41,019
We flip over a rock in this
guy's backyard, see what jumps out.

135
00:08:41,784 --> 00:08:43,856
And how exactly are we flipping
over this rock?

136
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,399
We crawl under there with him.

137
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,404
The guy's third-generation
corrupt mayor,

138
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:51,001
so I know he's rotten, but...

139
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:53,949
everything's just a good guess here
until you get me some good intel.

140
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,468
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- We're heading in now.

141
00:08:58,059 --> 00:09:00,330
You spend your weekends
making these things, don't you?

142
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,459
Yes, I do, and does anybody
appreciate that?

143
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:04,447
I do.

144
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:07,870
<i>I like the costumes.
I wish I was there.</i>

145
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:10,509
Parker, we need someone
to sweep the mayor's office

146
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:12,384
while he's here at the fundraiser.

147
00:09:13,323 --> 00:09:15,441
Fine. But I never get
to do anything fun.

148
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:26,208
- You can count on my support.
- Thank you.

149
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,568
- Sorry for interrupting, Mr. Kadjic.
- Please.

150
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:31,560
Mayor, you have two new donors.

151
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:33,489
That's a change... new money.

152
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,073
Lionel Gitt...

153
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:38,137
He's a real estate developer.
Does a lot of shopping centers.

154
00:09:38,262 --> 00:09:41,371
And the woman is Felicia Chase.
She's a PR flack from New York.

155
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,327
You do background checks
on your donors now?

156
00:09:43,452 --> 00:09:45,042
You can't be too careful.

157
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,960
They donated the maximum.

158
00:09:47,397 --> 00:09:49,211
10 grand? Each?

159
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:51,381
If you'll pardon me?

160
00:09:51,743 --> 00:09:52,743
Of course.

161
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,822
- How you doing this evening?
- Good. Thank you.

162
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:06,871
Nate, I'm in.

163
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,651
<i>All right, Parker, get those files.</i>

164
00:10:20,468 --> 00:10:21,494
Right there.

165
00:10:30,867 --> 00:10:33,316
Is this lieutenant Patrick Bonanno's
place of residence?

166
00:10:33,941 --> 00:10:36,635
All right, we're from the crime lab.
We're here to collect evidence

167
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:39,882
- This isn't a crime scene.
- Pardon me. I'm sorry.

168
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:42,140
He just say this wasn't
a crime scene?

169
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,394
I'm just housesitting.

170
00:10:48,486 --> 00:10:51,301
No. No, he's absolutely right.
This isn't a crime scene,

171
00:10:51,426 --> 00:10:54,027
- 'cause he done walked all over it.
- I smell soup.

172
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,293
You smell soup?

173
00:10:57,268 --> 00:10:59,324
I do.
What happened, Goldilocks?

174
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,304
You get hungry, decide to make yourself
some lunch in an active crime scene?

175
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:05,696
I would never do that.

176
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:09,871
Let's see what you would do.
Move.

177
00:11:10,689 --> 00:11:13,505
Move!
If I got to tell you one more time...

178
00:11:16,437 --> 00:11:18,093
How are you?
Thank you for coming.

179
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,387
- Brad Culpepper III.
- "The third."

180
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,723
I know. Yes. Hold on.

181
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:25,662
I know, I know, I know,
but my grandfather was the mayor,

182
00:11:25,787 --> 00:11:28,729
My father was the mayor, so I have to.
I don't want to, but I have to.

183
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,164
Lionel Gitt. This is Felicia Chase.

184
00:11:31,289 --> 00:11:33,981
So tell me,
what does a New York publicist

185
00:11:34,472 --> 00:11:37,112
and a Boston developer do
at my little fundraiser?

186
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,614
Just being politicaly active.

187
00:11:39,021 --> 00:11:41,798
You want to be politically active,
you put a sign on your front lawn.

188
00:11:42,075 --> 00:11:43,781
You donate the maximum.

189
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,409
- Let's talk.
- All right.

190
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:52,444
We are gonna search
every inch of this carpet.

191
00:11:52,642 --> 00:11:54,029
What am I looking for?

192
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:56,500
Fibers, damn it. Fibers.

193
00:11:56,625 --> 00:12:00,135
And you, you go search the bedroom
and the bathroom for DNA.

194
00:12:00,303 --> 00:12:02,888
Get me a toothbrush, a hairbrush.
I don't care if it's a nose trimmer.

195
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:05,273
You bag it, tag it,
and send it to the lab.

196
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:08,014
This carpet's made of fibers.

197
00:12:08,431 --> 00:12:12,342
Well, we're looking for other fibers...
Suspicious fibers, fibers of crime.

198
00:12:12,467 --> 00:12:14,559
Damn! What'd they teach you
at the academy, boy!

199
00:12:14,974 --> 00:12:16,124
On my nerves.

200
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:34,831
Mary?
I'll be with you in a minute.

201
00:12:34,956 --> 00:12:37,120
I've got to grab something out
of the mayor's office.

202
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,509
- Someone's coming.
- Would you excuse me for one moment?

203
00:12:40,966 --> 00:12:41,843
Certainly.

204
00:12:42,217 --> 00:12:44,179
You can handle this.
Just feed them a story.

205
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:47,140
I can't do that. I can, but Sophie
usually walks me through this.

206
00:12:50,505 --> 00:12:51,748
Take a deep breath.

207
00:12:52,012 --> 00:12:54,596
If you're uncomfortable, use it.
Make them feel uncomfortable.

208
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:56,307
<i>Here's what you tell them.</i>

209
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:03,833
- Who are you?
- Peggy Marwood.

210
00:13:05,564 --> 00:13:08,557
- Friend of Brad's.
- You can't just barge in here.

211
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:11,915
- Do you have an appointment?
- Yeah, actually, I do.

212
00:13:12,417 --> 00:13:16,047
That's what this is all about.
I sort of missed my appointment,

213
00:13:17,033 --> 00:13:18,345
if you know what I mean.

214
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:24,644
I sort of met Brad at the...

215
00:13:24,769 --> 00:13:27,347
- National mayors conference.
- national mayors conference...

216
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,642
- In Vegas...
- in Vegas...

217
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:33,395
about six to eight weeks ago.

218
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:35,160
Is that his family?

219
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:40,385
They don't have any weird
genetic things, do they?

220
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,909
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:47,701
The mayor didn't mention
anything to me about this.

222
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:49,537
Now make her think
you're gonna leave.

223
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,606
No problem.

224
00:13:50,731 --> 00:13:54,268
I'm just gonna go sit out there
with everybody,

225
00:13:54,393 --> 00:13:56,977
And I might need a wastebasket, though,
'cause I'm feeling a little...

226
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:58,367
you know what I mean?

227
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,716
You should wait in here
in that chair right there,

228
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,896
away from everyone who might...

229
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
see you.

230
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:10,369
Thanks.

231
00:14:14,613 --> 00:14:18,038
- I owe you one.
- Now, see? Trusting me is not so bad.

232
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:24,238
Felicia, do you know the mayor was
a professional baseball player?

233
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:26,425
- No. How exciting!
- Please.

234
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:29,054
It was a half a season
a long time ago.

235
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:30,339
Now look at me.

236
00:14:30,464 --> 00:14:33,747
- But I played Fenway a couple of times.
- Here's your drink, sir.

237
00:14:33,915 --> 00:14:36,285
So, you donated 10 grand apiece.

238
00:14:37,506 --> 00:14:38,877
You have my attention.

239
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,714
Please. No, be candid.

240
00:14:43,343 --> 00:14:45,186
I want you to know that Belbridge...

241
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,093
is a pro-business city.

242
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,597
How does business work with you,
Mr. Culpepper?

243
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:52,162
Frankly.

244
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:55,769
Well, frankly, those who are
with me from the beginning,

245
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,521
they are at the front of the line.

246
00:14:57,859 --> 00:14:59,917
Those who are with me
after the election,

247
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:01,708
they are at the back of the line.

248
00:15:02,456 --> 00:15:04,113
And those who are against me...

249
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:07,081
they are ground into dust.

250
00:15:08,923 --> 00:15:11,034
Now, the good news,
the great news...

251
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,678
is, because of your generosity,
you have moved to the front of the line.

252
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:17,376
So, let's talk business.

253
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:36,351
What you got?

254
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:41,317
Looks like his investigation notes...
From this month.

255
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,175
I think I found something.

256
00:15:44,461 --> 00:15:45,485
It's a twig.

257
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:49,155
You know, that's not a twig.
That is a grasshopper leg.

258
00:15:49,576 --> 00:15:51,939
Orthoptera gryllus.
It's not indigenous to this region.

259
00:15:52,064 --> 00:15:55,039
Son, you may have just blown
this case wide open.

260
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,862
Good work.
Top-line security, isn't he?

261
00:15:58,987 --> 00:16:01,566
Now, you go get back to work.
You go be all you can be.

262
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:11,083
Looks like he was investigating
a company called Kirsch Industries.

263
00:16:11,888 --> 00:16:14,997
Seems like Bonanno found out
that for the past couple of years,

264
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:17,385
Kirsch has been buying up property
on the waterfront.

265
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,021
What do you think this is?

266
00:16:23,631 --> 00:16:24,733
No idea.

267
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,320
Found a file in the mayor's office
for Kirsch Industries.

268
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,246
It's incorporated
in the Cayman islands.

269
00:16:31,371 --> 00:16:33,116
<i>The only industry in the Caymans</i>

270
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:34,951
is scuba diving and tax evasion.

271
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,810
It's a front company for the mayor.

272
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:39,536
The mayor did say he wanted
to build a park on the waterfront.

273
00:16:40,247 --> 00:16:43,489
So, city buys land
from Kirsch Industries,

274
00:16:43,614 --> 00:16:45,202
and the mayor cashes in.

275
00:16:47,162 --> 00:16:48,506
Parker, what else you got?

276
00:16:49,352 --> 00:16:51,514
There could be a safe in here,
but I don't have time

277
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,561
to move all the balls
and bats out of here.

278
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,088
<i>You could start a baseball team
with all the crap he has in his office.</i>

279
00:16:57,213 --> 00:16:59,171
What sort of opportunities
do you see?

280
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,039
Just...

281
00:17:01,991 --> 00:17:04,949
Mr. Mayor, I do like your approach.

282
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:06,308
Really, I do.

283
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:10,449
But I don't think that this city,
frankly, is a good fit for us.

284
00:17:11,474 --> 00:17:13,281
Now, good luck
with your re-election.

285
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,780
What are you doing? He was primed.
Could've used the esplanade.

286
00:17:19,905 --> 00:17:23,381
I got something much bigger in mind,
something he won't be able to refuse.

287
00:17:23,506 --> 00:17:26,345
Okay, guys, wrap it up.
We're gonna go on a little field trip.

288
00:17:42,377 --> 00:17:45,580
I don't know. Culpepper doesn't
strike me as the type to order a hit,

289
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:47,536
especially on something
like a graft case.

290
00:17:47,661 --> 00:17:50,795
What's the big deal? You get caught,
go on TV, you cry and get re-elected.

291
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,501
- It's the american way.
- Exactly.

292
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:55,076
*** This guy has been caught
in a dozen corruption cases.

293
00:17:55,201 --> 00:17:57,702
Each time, he's walked away,
and somebody else took the fall.

294
00:17:57,827 --> 00:17:59,414
This guy does not get caught.

295
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:01,746
I don't know.
It still doesn't feel right.

296
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,014
What's that?

297
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:05,598
It's a page I found
in Bonanno's notebook.

298
00:18:05,723 --> 00:18:07,711
"Maltese Falcon"?
The book or the movie?

299
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:09,618
It means something.

300
00:18:09,927 --> 00:18:10,875
I just...

301
00:18:12,827 --> 00:18:14,889
This is how we're gonna
take down the mayor.

302
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:18,673
- Baseball?
- We're gonna steal this ballpark.

303
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,018
And then the team.

304
00:18:23,759 --> 00:18:25,228
Not necessarily in that order.

305
00:18:32,139 --> 00:18:33,027
That's fine.

306
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,989
Your 3:00 with the head
of the sanitation union is here.

307
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,716
He's a friend of ours.

308
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,451
All right.

309
00:18:44,811 --> 00:18:46,249
<i>I thought you'd want to know,</i>

310
00:18:46,632 --> 00:18:49,044
those two high rollers
that blew you off yesterday,

311
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,089
they're down here at the
waterfront taking pictures.

312
00:18:53,495 --> 00:18:56,255
All right, thanks.
No, I'll take care of it.

313
00:18:58,414 --> 00:19:01,574
That real estate developer was taking
pictures down on the waterfront.

314
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,210
Want me to have the police
pick them up?

315
00:19:05,335 --> 00:19:06,519
"Pick them up."

316
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,712
If they're interested
in the waterfront,

317
00:19:10,073 --> 00:19:12,025
they can be responsible
for my legacy.

318
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:13,626
But, yeah.

319
00:19:14,484 --> 00:19:15,945
Find out what they're doing.

320
00:19:18,786 --> 00:19:19,991
Let's go.

321
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:24,411
All right.

322
00:19:25,102 --> 00:19:26,414
Good, good.

323
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,877
All right, all right. That's enough.

324
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,911
Think Culpepper must know
we're here by now.

325
00:19:33,036 --> 00:19:35,027
Or are you gonna put up
a sign or something?

326
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:38,424
- How do you want to play this?
- Classic con... hook, pinch and flip.

327
00:19:38,673 --> 00:19:42,354
Hook the mayor with the idea
we're gonna build a ballpark here.

328
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:45,782
That's right, and then pinch him for
a bribe to guarantee he gets the action.

329
00:19:45,907 --> 00:19:49,227
Hardison tells me he runs a lot of gray
money through his re-election campaign,

330
00:19:49,352 --> 00:19:51,520
So he'll take the bribe out
of his re-election funds.

331
00:19:51,645 --> 00:19:52,925
Which is a federal offense.

332
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:55,292
All right, so once we nail
the mayor for the bribe...

333
00:19:55,417 --> 00:19:57,061
The flip, right?

334
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,757
When the heat comes down,
whoever shot Bonanno cuts a deal,

335
00:20:00,882 --> 00:20:02,134
the mayor goes down.

336
00:20:02,259 --> 00:20:03,533
Perfectly sound plan.

337
00:20:03,658 --> 00:20:05,161
- Just have one question.
- Shoot.

338
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,207
How do we convince him
with no team to play in it?

339
00:20:28,421 --> 00:20:31,494
- I'm looking for the manager.
- You got him. What can I do for you?

340
00:20:31,619 --> 00:20:34,693
- Roy Chappell. I'm your new catcher.
- We already have a catcher.

341
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,718
- Who signed you?
- The owner did.

342
00:20:38,212 --> 00:20:40,138
Found me in the great north league.

343
00:20:40,263 --> 00:20:42,207
- Minnesota?
- Alaska.

344
00:20:42,332 --> 00:20:46,013
Yeah, but I've played all over...
Venezuela, South Korea, Portland.

345
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:49,581
I talk to the owner every day
and he didn't say nothing about you.

346
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:56,311
Look, man, I'm gonna be honest with you.
I was hired by the owner to come in

347
00:20:56,628 --> 00:20:58,937
to get an outside view
of how this team works.

348
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:00,560
I report directly to him.

349
00:21:01,406 --> 00:21:03,010
We both know what that means.

350
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,638
Now, you can call him.

351
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:09,392
He's probably just gonna yank me from
the team and bring some other guy in

352
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,047
who probably won't be
as honest with you as I am.

353
00:21:13,845 --> 00:21:15,409
We've got some BP left.

354
00:21:15,534 --> 00:21:17,663
Get on out there,
and we'll see what you can do.

355
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:21,260
Billy?

356
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:26,046
The owner signed a catcher
to spy on us.

357
00:21:26,171 --> 00:21:27,561
Roy Chappell.

358
00:21:28,417 --> 00:21:29,617
Check him out.

359
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,498
You got drafted in the sixth round
right out of high school.

360
00:21:35,623 --> 00:21:38,020
Had a cup of coffee
in the royals organization.

361
00:21:38,145 --> 00:21:41,076
Then you bounced around the minors,
you bounced around the world.

362
00:21:41,201 --> 00:21:42,634
And, as we can see here,

363
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,137
you made a very popular commercial
for an energy drink in Japan.

364
00:21:50,397 --> 00:21:51,947
<i>Super happy power go!</i>

365
00:21:53,651 --> 00:21:55,563
It took me 13 hours.

366
00:21:56,217 --> 00:21:59,167
There's only one problem.
I don't like baseball.

367
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:02,242
- What? Everybody likes baseball.
- I don't like baseball, man.

368
00:22:02,367 --> 00:22:05,169
All right? I don't like any sport you
can't score on defense.

369
00:22:05,294 --> 00:22:08,993
Football, hockey,
even basketball, but baseball?

370
00:22:09,872 --> 00:22:12,747
- I'm not even talking to you.
- It's boring.

371
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,050
Hey, wait.
Can you play the commercial?

372
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,596
<i>Super happy power go!</i>

373
00:22:21,477 --> 00:22:24,855
Yeah, he said, "finish out the season,
But don't sign a long-term lease."

374
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,130
That's weird.

375
00:22:34,342 --> 00:22:35,492
Hello, Marge?

376
00:22:36,171 --> 00:22:37,480
I've got some bad news.

377
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:40,037
Yeah, that's right, run away.

378
00:22:40,497 --> 00:22:44,097
Faster you start panicking,
The faster I can get out of here.

379
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:54,831
This time with a little more heat.

380
00:22:58,368 --> 00:23:00,657
<i>Next up on "sports line,
we have Robert in Palmerston.</i>

381
00:23:00,782 --> 00:23:02,258
<i>Robert, what's your question?</i>

382
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:05,228
Yeah, John.
Thanks for taking my call.

383
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:07,592
I'm a first-time caller,
long-time listener.

384
00:23:07,717 --> 00:23:09,732
<i>Appreciate that, robert.
What's on your mind?</i>

385
00:23:09,857 --> 00:23:12,268
Yeah, I just wanted to hear
your thoughts on the rumors

386
00:23:12,393 --> 00:23:14,237
that the beavers are
leaving Palmerston.

387
00:23:14,362 --> 00:23:16,406
<i>Have not heard that.
Have you heard that, Danny?</i>

388
00:23:16,531 --> 00:23:19,776
<i>I heard something about it this morning,
But one of those clubhouse rumors.</i>

389
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:22,358
Thank you. That's all I wanted to say.
Thank you. Goodbye.

390
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,111
Long-time listener, first-time caller.
Long-time listener...

391
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:28,259
<i>Next up is Malik from Palmerston.
What say you, Malik?</i>

392
00:23:28,384 --> 00:23:31,266
Yeah, man. I don't think they should
be called the beavers anymore.

393
00:23:31,391 --> 00:23:33,522
They should be called the
weasels for leaving our town.

394
00:23:33,647 --> 00:23:35,840
That's all I'm trying to say.

395
00:23:35,965 --> 00:23:37,440
You feel me, man? You feel me?

396
00:23:37,565 --> 00:23:41,065
Los beavers me han entristecido
con su traici?Â³n, Esteban.

397
00:23:41,588 --> 00:23:42,988
You speak spanish?

398
00:23:43,657 --> 00:23:44,464
<i>Si­.</i>

399
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:45,758
Seriously?

400
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:49,537
All right, well, good job, Eliot.

401
00:23:49,662 --> 00:23:52,055
Yeah, just keep me posted,
all right?

402
00:23:52,776 --> 00:23:55,683
So, thanks to that little rumor we
started about the team leaving town,

403
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:57,451
Ticket sales... crazy.

404
00:23:57,934 --> 00:24:01,310
- Here's to our national pastime.
- Yeah, baseball or the con?

405
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:04,453
How long are we gonna have to
park outside city hall before.

406
00:24:04,578 --> 00:24:05,578
Mr. Gitt!

407
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:07,737
Not very long.

408
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:11,376
I saw you from across the street.
I thought I'd thank you again.

409
00:24:11,501 --> 00:24:14,152
Mr. Mayor, we apologize
for leaving so abruptly.

410
00:24:14,277 --> 00:24:16,811
- We didn't want to waste your time.
- Please!

411
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:20,416
I just wish that you were comfortable
sharing your plans with me.

412
00:24:23,571 --> 00:24:24,621
Trust me...

413
00:24:24,818 --> 00:24:26,797
What's good for belbridge
is good for you.

414
00:24:26,922 --> 00:24:30,009
Call me... anytime.
Here's my card. There's no pressure.

415
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,177
Thank you.

416
00:24:32,791 --> 00:24:34,013
Worst lift ever.

417
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,181
Amateurs.

418
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:41,368
Be still my heart... If my heart were
somewhere in my pants.

419
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:44,476
- This is a thing of beauty.
- He's building a ballpark?

420
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:46,767
A riverfront ballpark.
You know what that means?

421
00:24:46,892 --> 00:24:47,693
Jobs?

422
00:24:47,943 --> 00:24:49,884
Jobs. Please.

423
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:53,678
A ballpark is $30 million
of borrowed taxpayer money

424
00:24:53,803 --> 00:24:55,446
Just falling from the sky.

425
00:24:55,571 --> 00:24:57,071
It's the holy grail.

426
00:24:57,514 --> 00:24:58,969
If these plans are right,

427
00:24:59,094 --> 00:25:01,452
They're gonna have buy up
every inch of this waterfront.

428
00:25:01,577 --> 00:25:05,080
You know, my daddy tried to build up
the waterfront. He never could.

429
00:25:05,205 --> 00:25:06,305
Now, this...

430
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:10,206
A ballpark with my name on it...

431
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,718
This... this is my legacy.

432
00:25:13,374 --> 00:25:14,899
How do we build a ballpark?

433
00:25:15,024 --> 00:25:16,967
We don't have a team.
Wait a minute.

434
00:25:17,092 --> 00:25:19,725
Wait, I read something
in the paper today.

435
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:22,603
"Palmerston beavers
deny team is moving.

436
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,106
Owners will address rumors
after today's game."

437
00:25:25,274 --> 00:25:26,374
Get the car.

438
00:25:26,499 --> 00:25:28,575
We believe! You can't leave!

439
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,679
We believe! You can't leave!

440
00:25:30,885 --> 00:25:33,236
We believe! You can't leave!

441
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:35,482
We believe! You can't leave!

442
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,560
We believe! You can't leave!

443
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,628
Play ball!

444
00:26:18,017 --> 00:26:20,915
It's a heck of a team you have here.
How long have you owned the club?

445
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,157
Six years.

446
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:24,439
It's been a real
labor of love for me.

447
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:26,187
Then what's all this
about you moving?

448
00:26:26,312 --> 00:26:28,095
I don't know how
those rumors get started.

449
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,463
But, hey,
if it puts fannies in those seats,

450
00:26:30,856 --> 00:26:32,156
What's the harm?

451
00:26:32,281 --> 00:26:33,799
I like the way you do business.

452
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:37,369
<i> Looks like the beavers' pitcher
is calling a powwow at the mound.</i>

453
00:26:37,494 --> 00:26:40,905
Hope this is about you waving me off,
man, because you can't hit the slider.

454
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,004
No, no. We just got to know.

455
00:26:43,129 --> 00:26:45,879
I mean, what's the deal?
Is the team moving?

456
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:48,290
Really want to know?

457
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:49,818
- Yeah.
- Want to know?

458
00:26:49,943 --> 00:26:51,243
Got family here.

459
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:53,224
Team's moving.

460
00:26:53,842 --> 00:26:56,042
Just a question of when and where.

461
00:26:57,325 --> 00:26:58,325
Thanks.

462
00:26:58,561 --> 00:27:00,552
No problem. Let's go.

463
00:27:02,246 --> 00:27:05,482
Hey. When I call the damn slider,
you throw the slider.

464
00:27:05,607 --> 00:27:06,560
All right?

465
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:08,244
Gotcha.

466
00:27:17,044 --> 00:27:18,894
That's them with the owner.

467
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,271
It's really happening.

468
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,738
Mr. Mayor! Good day for a ballgame.

469
00:27:26,863 --> 00:27:29,974
How are you? Bud, how are you?
Listen, can I talk to you for a minute?

470
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:30,918
Sure.

471
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,578
<i>Looks like he's gonna try to score.</i>

472
00:27:36,703 --> 00:27:38,353
<i>The throw to the plate.</i>

473
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,329
You're out!

474
00:27:47,112 --> 00:27:49,162
Now, I know the team is moving.

475
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,530
You're building a new park.

476
00:27:52,349 --> 00:27:56,158
I know baseball. I love baseball. And I
want you to build the park in Belbridge.

477
00:27:56,283 --> 00:27:58,395
You know, I considered Belbridge,

478
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,903
But I like the incentives being offered
by another town Down by fall river.

479
00:28:02,028 --> 00:28:04,628
By "incentives," you mean
cut of the concession,

480
00:28:04,753 --> 00:28:08,021
- piece of the construction, a buy-in?
- Ah, you are pro-business.

481
00:28:08,146 --> 00:28:09,676
All right, give me a number.

482
00:28:09,801 --> 00:28:12,211
You know, the first rule
of real estate, Mr. Mayor.

483
00:28:12,336 --> 00:28:14,436
Never negotiate against yourself.

484
00:28:14,561 --> 00:28:17,049
And the first rule of politics,
Mr. Gitt...

485
00:28:17,174 --> 00:28:19,970
When you want something,
be aggressive.

486
00:28:24,694 --> 00:28:27,738
$250,000. That seems fair.

487
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:31,005
I'll cut you a check in the morning.

488
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:34,530
My chief of staff will call you,
tell you where and when.

489
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:38,507
Okay, guys, we got him.

490
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,320
<i>Now batting for the beavers,
catcher roy chappell.</i>

491
00:28:41,445 --> 00:28:42,477
Meet me outside.

492
00:28:42,602 --> 00:28:45,013
What? Man, I'm three for four.

493
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:48,488
This guy's throwing grapefruits.
I ain't going anywhere.

494
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:56,584
All right, good news, bad news.

495
00:28:56,709 --> 00:28:57,595
Good news?

496
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,862
The mayor's hooked.
We're in the pinch.

497
00:28:59,987 --> 00:29:01,052
Bad news?

498
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:03,815
I think we lost Eliot
until the playoffs.

499
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,670
When the mayor gives us the check, the
money is from his re-election campaign.

500
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:13,872
You left early, man.
Bottom of the ninth.

501
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:16,911
Excuse your rudeness. I'm explaining
the con. It's very complicated.

502
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:20,411
The mayor gives us a check, we deposit
it in some company connected to him.

503
00:29:20,536 --> 00:29:22,714
Looks like he's embezzling
from his campaign funds.

504
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,512
Bottom of the ninth.

505
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,472
I hit a walk-off single.
Crowd goes nuts.

506
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:30,476
But that's not all there is, okay?
There's the Bonanno thing.

507
00:29:30,644 --> 00:29:33,487
What? We give Bonanno's notes
to the newspaper, man?

508
00:29:33,612 --> 00:29:36,315
They named a sandwich
after me at TJ Philbin's.

509
00:29:39,127 --> 00:29:42,154
I'll give it to you, man.
The sandwich thing is pretty cool.

510
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:44,766
- Is this a hoagie?
- No, man, it's a reuben.

511
00:29:44,891 --> 00:29:46,438
Sorry, this is the mayor.

512
00:29:46,563 --> 00:29:49,662
Is it an okay
time to take this call, or...?

513
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,135
Yeah. Go ahead. Good.

514
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,130
Congrats on the sandwich.

515
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,960
Lionel Gitt. How may I help you?

516
00:29:56,236 --> 00:29:57,086
Mr. Gitt.

517
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,672
Mr. Mayor.
A pleasure to hear from you.

518
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,507
We have to adjust our agreement.

519
00:30:02,111 --> 00:30:05,886
It's pretty late notice
to start changing things, your honor.

520
00:30:06,235 --> 00:30:08,973
No, it's for the good.
It's gonna be cash.

521
00:30:09,937 --> 00:30:10,807
Cash?

522
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,444
Yes, cash! Isn't that better?

523
00:30:13,923 --> 00:30:15,921
You see,
my partners in the waterfront deal,

524
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:18,912
They want in, so they're
gonna front the cash. Isn't that great?

525
00:30:19,037 --> 00:30:20,901
But they said
that they'd like to meet you.

526
00:30:21,288 --> 00:30:22,578
Fair enough.

527
00:30:23,028 --> 00:30:25,528
Why don't you just
give me the address?

528
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,277
Okay, well,
we'll see you in an hour.

529
00:30:29,402 --> 00:30:30,452
In an hour.

530
00:30:33,137 --> 00:30:34,687
This is for the best.

531
00:30:39,231 --> 00:30:42,681
You just have to keep the heat
off us for a little longer.

532
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:52,717
Here, look it up.

533
00:30:53,722 --> 00:30:57,146
Okay, the address is right in the middle
of the belbridge waterfront.

534
00:30:57,526 --> 00:30:58,773
It's a walk-away.

535
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:01,289
No, look, this is even better,
'cause he has partners,

536
00:31:01,414 --> 00:31:03,569
So this is our chance
to bring them down, too.

537
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:07,030
If the bribe is in cash, the con doesn't
work. $250,000 in cash we're gonna get.

538
00:31:07,155 --> 00:31:09,867
That had to have come from somewhere.
Hardison can track it.

539
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,368
No, Hardison cannot.

540
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:15,289
You kept saying that you don't think the
mayor's the kind of guy to kill a cop?

541
00:31:15,609 --> 00:31:18,918
<i>So, let's go meet the kind of guys
who kill cops on the waterfront.</i>

542
00:31:19,086 --> 00:31:20,237
That's a solid plan.

543
00:31:20,362 --> 00:31:23,339
Where are these partners coming from?
And why'd they just show up?

544
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,257
The altese fcon" thing...
it's just weird.

545
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,575
Okay, enough!

546
00:31:27,281 --> 00:31:30,054
We're talking about bringing
down a corrupt mayor

547
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,323
and cleaning up a city.
I mean, it's huge.

548
00:31:32,448 --> 00:31:34,352
It's probably the biggest
thing we've ever done.

549
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,243
They're not handing out
trophies for this.

550
00:31:36,368 --> 00:31:39,618
- We don't always win, man.
- Yeah, but we never quit.

551
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:43,817
Okay, so, look.
You guys check out the security.

552
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:47,285
You do the perimeter, yeah?
And we'll be on the inside.

553
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,001
We're gonna do this.
We can do it.

554
00:31:50,126 --> 00:31:52,159
We're gonna bring this guy down.

555
00:32:09,074 --> 00:32:10,451
Homeland security.

556
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,853
- Surprise inspection.
- Nobody called us.

557
00:32:12,978 --> 00:32:14,848
That's 'cause it has
nothing to do with you.

558
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,603
We're here to inspect your...

559
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:18,852
"gate-mounted x-ray imaging system."

560
00:32:18,977 --> 00:32:21,181
Was installed with the federal ant
i-terrorism money.

561
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:22,690
We're just checking it out.

562
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,931
Give us five minutes... And space.

563
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:26,986
We really shouldn't leave, so...

564
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:30,030
Hey, aren't you Roy Chappell?

565
00:32:32,021 --> 00:32:34,790
You hit the gam e-winner yesterday for
the beavers. I was there with my kid.

566
00:32:34,915 --> 00:32:36,537
- I did.
- What you doing here?

567
00:32:36,928 --> 00:32:39,873
It's triple-a ball,
so I got to have a day job, you know?

568
00:32:39,998 --> 00:32:41,455
Excuse me. Sorry.

569
00:32:42,758 --> 00:32:44,443
Hey, Roy? You mind?

570
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,362
It's for my kid.

571
00:32:46,875 --> 00:32:48,507
No, I don't mind, man.

572
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,807
All right. Thanks, roy.

573
00:32:54,804 --> 00:32:57,099
- Who are you right now?
- What do you want me to do?

574
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,238
- Seriously?
- Like a role model.

575
00:33:00,363 --> 00:33:02,260
- Seriously?
- What? It's not my fault.

576
00:33:02,385 --> 00:33:04,815
Man, just put the taps
on the video feeds.

577
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:05,858
Hold, wait.

578
00:33:09,562 --> 00:33:11,672
No, something's not right here, man.

579
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,381
Thank you for meeting
me at such short notice.

580
00:33:29,843 --> 00:33:33,093
The foundation of every good
business relationship is trust.

581
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,107
And cash on a barrel.

582
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:37,389
Like I said, business-friendly.

583
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,184
Nate, I'm under the dock.

584
00:33:44,101 --> 00:33:46,152
<i>Okay, put it down
with the rest of them.</i>

585
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:50,722
Guys with guns.

586
00:33:52,436 --> 00:33:53,945
- What?
- What?

587
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:56,992
They're just walking around
like they own the place.

588
00:34:06,042 --> 00:34:07,082
"Soybeans."

589
00:34:13,197 --> 00:34:15,678
So, let's talk about the terms
of the deal before we continue.

590
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:17,944
- Where your partners?
- They'll be here any second.

591
00:34:18,069 --> 00:34:21,517
I just thought that we would hash things
out before they arrived, you know,

592
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:23,143
just save us some time.

593
00:34:28,714 --> 00:34:30,956
That's the list of all
the security upgrades They installed

594
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:32,585
with the federal money, right?

595
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,121
How much did they spend?

596
00:34:35,082 --> 00:34:36,289
$20 million.

597
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:39,851
That's not what the inside of an x-ray
imaging system's supposed to look like.

598
00:34:39,976 --> 00:34:42,570
No, it's what the inside of
an eas y-bake oven looks like.

599
00:34:44,305 --> 00:34:46,695
Infrared? There's no infrared
feed on these cameras.

600
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,210
And 24-hour surveillance?

601
00:34:48,827 --> 00:34:50,713
The cameras are rolling,
but that drive is not

602
00:34:50,881 --> 00:34:53,668
big enough to record more than a day.
Hell, this is the least secure

603
00:34:53,793 --> 00:34:55,379
port on the east coast.

604
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,012
So, where'd that $20 million go?

605
00:35:04,502 --> 00:35:06,072
I'm thinking inventory.

606
00:35:07,444 --> 00:35:09,148
These beans are made of guns.

607
00:35:11,494 --> 00:35:12,776
And hand grenades.

608
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,654
You know the terms of our agreement.
Why don't you just say?

609
00:35:16,626 --> 00:35:18,818
Well, never negotiate against yourself.
Am I right?

610
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:20,716
- Let's go. We're done.
- No, no.

611
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,370
My partners will be here any...

612
00:35:24,818 --> 00:35:25,849
Son of a...

613
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:28,380
- What is that?
- It's feedback.

614
00:35:29,213 --> 00:35:31,336
Somebody else is transmitting
on high frequency.

615
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:34,882
- All right, come here.
- Jabberwocky!

616
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,133
That's a code word.

617
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,351
That's FBI. Nate, we got FBI.

618
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,938
FBI's right on top of you!

619
00:36:15,512 --> 00:36:16,423
So, the guy

620
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,981
who put out a hit on a police
detective Is an FBI snitch?

621
00:36:19,588 --> 00:36:20,701
That's not fair.

622
00:36:23,537 --> 00:36:24,487
That one.

623
00:36:24,826 --> 00:36:26,561
Federal I.D. Cellphone.

624
00:36:27,557 --> 00:36:28,729
Roskin, Connell.

625
00:36:36,147 --> 00:36:37,788
I've got the front exit.

626
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:39,029
Call it.

627
00:36:39,311 --> 00:36:41,365
- <i>Side door, check in.
</i>- Team 2 in position.

628
00:36:41,713 --> 00:36:43,784
- <i>Team 3, back door.
</i>- Team 3, ready.

629
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:45,440
On my mark, we go.

630
00:36:51,763 --> 00:36:52,626
Who's this?

631
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:54,786
You come in,
and we'll kill all the hostages.

632
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:57,349
- What hostages?
- You thought the mayor was the one?

633
00:36:57,474 --> 00:37:00,056
We got a whole sunday school of
people up in here. We got old folks,

634
00:37:00,181 --> 00:37:03,345
we got nuns, and we got explosives.
You come in, you make headlines.

635
00:37:05,178 --> 00:37:06,526
We got any eyes in there?

636
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:08,354
- Any cameras?
- Nothing.

637
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:10,602
All right, we hold! We hold!

638
00:37:10,885 --> 00:37:12,271
They're not going anywhere.

639
00:37:12,596 --> 00:37:13,721
Call for backup.

640
00:37:14,026 --> 00:37:15,842
I want bomb squads,
full assault team,

641
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:16,932
snipers.

642
00:37:17,647 --> 00:37:19,112
They want to play rough...

643
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:21,488
We play rough.

644
00:37:21,795 --> 00:37:24,713
Now we know why he never went down
for any of the other corruption cases.

645
00:37:24,838 --> 00:37:26,025
'cause he's a snitch.

646
00:37:27,092 --> 00:37:28,404
It's possible that he

647
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:30,748
doesn't know anything
about Bonanno getting shot.

648
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,412
I knew that would come back.

649
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,061
What?

650
00:37:38,439 --> 00:37:39,923
- You did.
- I didn't.

651
00:37:40,372 --> 00:37:42,843
My FBI handlers,
they told me to be very careful

652
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:45,512
because there was a state police
investigation, so I told...

653
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,890
Someone else, okay?
But I had nothing to do with it.

654
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,913
He has a kid!
He has a son!

655
00:37:50,038 --> 00:37:52,603
- He almost died!
- I know, I know! I did nothing!

656
00:37:53,151 --> 00:37:54,938
Do you understand he almost died?!

657
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:57,974
Yeah, Nate, I bought you some time,
but right about now, We got a whole army

658
00:37:58,099 --> 00:37:59,401
of five coming down on us.

659
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:01,453
It's a big day.

660
00:38:01,945 --> 00:38:03,322
Big, big day for us.

661
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,698
You have to let him go.

662
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:08,335
Then kill him now!
We have to get out of here.

663
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:10,621
No, please!

664
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,965
We'll deal with him later.

665
00:38:23,653 --> 00:38:26,887
Here's what we're gonna do.
Come here. I got a plan here. Listen.

666
00:38:27,259 --> 00:38:30,771
No. Nate, are you kidding me, man?
That is the worst plan I've ever heard.

667
00:38:30,896 --> 00:38:32,686
Look, he needs a distraction.

668
00:38:33,025 --> 00:38:35,601
We did just find a box
of ammo and explosives.

669
00:38:36,934 --> 00:38:37,976
I'm just saying.

670
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:40,821
- The problem is in the delivery.
- And a detonator.

671
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,045
Look. Not lucille.

672
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:58,070
Not lucille! She all I got left.

673
00:39:01,676 --> 00:39:03,161
Don't you do it to me.

674
00:39:04,356 --> 00:39:06,053
Get that look out your eye.

675
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,664
You ain't got to be
so happy about it, Eliot.

676
00:39:08,789 --> 00:39:11,755
You always had it in for my van.
You always had it in for Lucille.

677
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:15,156
You said she smells. She don't stink.
It's just an odor.

678
00:39:18,146 --> 00:39:20,476
<i>Is this the FBI agent in charge?</i>

679
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:24,936
This is special agent Amy Nevins. <i>I'm
leader of this task force. Who's this?</i>

680
00:39:25,061 --> 00:39:27,804
<i>- What happened to the other guy?</i>
- He got a little jumpy.

681
00:39:27,929 --> 00:39:31,076
But I'm willing to talk, and as a sign
of good faith, release one hostage.

682
00:39:31,679 --> 00:39:32,829
<i>But just one.</i>

683
00:39:33,481 --> 00:39:35,872
Good. Good. That's a good start.

684
00:39:37,806 --> 00:39:38,965
Sorry, Lucille.

685
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,523
I love you, baby.

686
00:39:40,648 --> 00:39:42,126
I ain't gonna forget you.

687
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:44,515
Dude, grenades.

688
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,247
Dude, the van!

689
00:39:46,657 --> 00:39:48,385
You know she out of warranty, right?

690
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:53,614
You ready?

691
00:39:54,691 --> 00:39:55,581
Ready.

692
00:39:56,653 --> 00:39:57,688
Let's go.

693
00:39:59,726 --> 00:40:01,231
I'm releasing the hostage now.

694
00:40:01,728 --> 00:40:04,318
Hostage coming out! Hostage coming out!
Go! Go!

695
00:40:05,017 --> 00:40:06,235
Hostage is out!

696
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:11,700
Get me out of here.

697
00:40:17,822 --> 00:40:19,040
I've always been

698
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:20,876
and forever shall be

699
00:40:21,209 --> 00:40:22,210
your friend.

700
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:23,598
What the...

701
00:40:34,275 --> 00:40:35,762
I'll never forget you.

702
00:40:39,913 --> 00:40:42,272
What the hell was that?
Is everyone all right?

703
00:40:43,121 --> 00:40:44,816
At least we got the hostage out.

704
00:40:45,344 --> 00:40:47,008
Affirmative. Hostage is clear.

705
00:40:47,133 --> 00:40:48,177
<i>She's fine.</i>

706
00:40:48,603 --> 00:40:49,404
She?

707
00:40:49,933 --> 00:40:52,193
Yeah, those other agents
are bringing her around now.

708
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,269
Hostage is out!

709
00:40:58,868 --> 00:41:00,589
<i>- Hostage is out!</i>
- It's okay.

710
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:03,691
<i>- Hostage is out!</i>
- You're okay.

711
00:41:04,654 --> 00:41:07,346
- Everything's all right.
- It's okay. It's okay.

712
00:41:09,875 --> 00:41:11,222
What an ordeal.

713
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:13,229
Boy.

714
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:22,235
- You're okay.
- Come on, come on.

715
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:28,819
- Isn't that your car?
- Shut up.

716
00:41:34,559 --> 00:41:35,367
Get in!

717
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:36,891
- No!
- Hardison!

718
00:41:37,114 --> 00:41:40,345
No, you ignored us. You screwed up.
You. And you killed lucille.

719
00:41:40,470 --> 00:41:42,954
Priorities, please.
You know, we'll go somewhere safe.

720
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,366
You can bitch me out all you want.
Get in.

721
00:41:45,916 --> 00:41:47,508
- Kiss my ass.
- Come on!

722
00:41:59,991 --> 00:42:02,298
Why didn't you tell us
there were only two of them?

723
00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:06,067
Listen, they found my wire.
You said they would never find my wire!

724
00:42:06,571 --> 00:42:08,865
Tell me why I don't break our deal?

725
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,885
- Not my fault.
- Those people are out in the wind now!

726
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:14,542
We have no idea who they are
or what they want.

727
00:42:15,853 --> 00:42:17,242
I wouldn't say that.

728
00:42:20,407 --> 00:42:21,660
James Sterling...

729
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:24,060
Interpol.

730
00:42:24,996 --> 00:42:27,379
Just rolls off the tongue,
doesn't it?
