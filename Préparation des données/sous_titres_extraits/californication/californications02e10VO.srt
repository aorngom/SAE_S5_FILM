2
00:00:45,689 --> 00:00:47,338
What does that mean...
"wow"?

3
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:51,933
I see what you mean.
You got quite a lump here.

4
00:00:52,336 --> 00:00:53,678
It's grotesque.

5
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:56,222
- Cancer?
- Not necessarily.

6
00:00:56,499 --> 00:00:57,957
What the fuck is it?

7
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:01,477
One very angry and swollen
lymph node.

8
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:05,189
- Down there?
- I keep telling him it's nothing.

9
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:06,816
Not necessarily.

10
00:01:10,187 --> 00:01:13,386
- What are you working on these days?
- What am I working on?

11
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:16,163
I'm working on trying to figure out
what that fucking lump in my junk is.

12
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,245
- That's what I'm working on.
- I say we biopsy that sucker.

13
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,164
We'll do it right here, right now.

14
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:25,212
I'd love to, but I got
a lot of important meetings

15
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:28,963
and appointments and such, so...
I'm a very busy man. I got to run.

16
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:31,257
Hank, you're doing this right now.

17
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,593
Come on. It'll be fun.
It won't hurt at all.

18
00:01:35,104 --> 00:01:37,888
That's not true. It's gonna
hurt like hell. Especially down here.

19
00:01:38,013 --> 00:01:39,839
But it's gonna be quick,
though, right?

20
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:43,686
In the whole scheme of things?
Sure. Over before you know it.

21
00:01:44,097 --> 00:01:47,752
Okay, hold up. Hold it. Hold it.
Is there time for me to get a drink?

22
00:01:47,877 --> 00:01:51,033
Can you send a man-nurse over
to Gil Turner's for a bottle?

23
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,866
For you?
Sure.

24
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,019
<i>The body of Kurt Cobain
was found in a room above the garage</i>

25
00:02:03,144 --> 00:02:05,586
<i>of his fashionable
Lake Washington Boulevard...</i>

26
00:02:16,253 --> 00:02:18,467
What's wrong?
Are you okay?

27
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:20,383
Kurt Cobain...

28
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,164
- He's dead.
- What?

29
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,367
What happened?

30
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:28,003
Suicide.

31
00:02:29,662 --> 00:02:31,606
Well, that's a fucking shame.

32
00:02:35,368 --> 00:02:36,800
And I'm pregnant.

33
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:50,628
It's positive.

34
00:02:50,796 --> 00:02:53,464
- As in?
- As in "I'm with child."

35
00:02:53,632 --> 00:02:56,528
What's so positive about that?
Here. Have another one.

36
00:02:56,653 --> 00:02:58,812
Look. Pee on this.
Pee on that.

37
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:01,599
We've done three, okay?
I'm all out of pee.

38
00:03:01,974 --> 00:03:03,861
Then drink some water
and pee on this.

39
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:06,255
- I'm pregnant.
- I'm not convinced.

40
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,933
This is happening.

41
00:03:08,499 --> 00:03:09,396
Fuck.

42
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,404
The rabbit done died, huh?

43
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:13,701
All right. Okay.

44
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:18,239
What do we do now?

45
00:03:20,032 --> 00:03:23,618
Well, it's okay. I mean, you know,
I'll just take care of it, so...

46
00:03:25,128 --> 00:03:26,664
We'll take care of it.

47
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:29,667
So that's it... we've decided?
That's good. Yeah.

48
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,067
Well-played, woman.
I now feel entirely

49
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,481
incapable of giving you
the right answer here.

50
00:03:37,606 --> 00:03:41,583
Well, no. I mean, Jesus Christ, Hank,
we barely know each other, right?

51
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:44,935
- You got a girlfriend.
- Come on. It's a loose arrangement.

52
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,954
The waify models
are good that way, you know?

53
00:03:47,079 --> 00:03:48,394
And you

54
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:51,981
have a boyfriend. Let's not forget
that important little factoid.

55
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:55,209
I have a boyfriend who's on tour...
A boyfriend I never see...

56
00:03:55,334 --> 00:03:57,611
A boyfriend I think
less and less about.

57
00:03:57,929 --> 00:03:59,237
All right, look.

58
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:01,782
I don't want to be insensitive,
all right,

59
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,067
but are we entirely sure
that this is my doing?

60
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:09,501
Yep. We seem pretty sure. Okay.

61
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,283
Most likely, it's nothing.

62
00:04:12,494 --> 00:04:13,627
But what could it be?

63
00:04:14,653 --> 00:04:17,965
It's hard to say. You could have
a nasty infection somewhere.

64
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:20,262
Well, that sounds very manageable.

65
00:04:20,387 --> 00:04:23,554
Absolutely. We could probably knock
that out with a dose of antibiotics.

66
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:27,182
- Great. What else?
- It could very well be an std.

67
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,400
- No, I don't think so. What else?
- Really?

68
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:33,188
No, let's stay in this arena.
I want to know more.

69
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,983
Well, syphilis is a big one.
It's on the rise.

70
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,651
- Syphilis?
- Syphilis?

71
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,946
You hear that?
Nice.

72
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:40,972
I don't see any reason
 to assume that.

73
00:04:41,097 --> 00:04:43,517
- It could be cancer.
- It could be. You never know.

74
00:04:43,642 --> 00:04:45,117
That's better than syphilis.

75
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,762
Woman, what is wrong with you?
You'd rather I have cancer?

76
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:53,421
We've got to talk about options.

77
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,694
I don't have any pamphlets
or literature on me,

78
00:04:55,814 --> 00:04:58,446
but you strike me
as a painfully liberal,

79
00:04:58,566 --> 00:05:00,219
pro-choice kind of a gal.

80
00:05:00,379 --> 00:05:01,379
Who, me?

81
00:05:02,098 --> 00:05:04,291
Oh, my God, no.
I'm ultraconservative.

82
00:05:04,411 --> 00:05:05,651
Like N.R.A.,

83
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:07,642
- pro-life, the whole...
- Really?

84
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,935
That really limits our options,

85
00:05:10,055 --> 00:05:12,106
but let's sit with that
for a moment.

86
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:14,871
Seriously, I have been
on a kind of...

87
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:18,123
non-abortion streak
my whole life,

88
00:05:18,743 --> 00:05:20,782
and I feel kind of good
about that, you know?

89
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,325
Yeah. I get that.

90
00:05:23,124 --> 00:05:24,801
I get it, but do you really...

91
00:05:25,238 --> 00:05:28,081
- Really want to have a child right now?
- No, not really.

92
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:30,860
You do, right?

93
00:05:31,202 --> 00:05:33,773
No. God, no.
I mean, I am a child.

94
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:35,669
A fairly big one, you know,

95
00:05:36,189 --> 00:05:38,341
but when children have children,

96
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:41,386
it never works out for anyone.
Especially me.

97
00:05:41,546 --> 00:05:43,743
Right. I could see
it might seriously hamper

98
00:05:43,863 --> 00:05:45,354
your ability to drink

99
00:05:46,051 --> 00:05:48,101
- and get laid on a nightly basis.
- No,

100
00:05:48,261 --> 00:05:50,186
I can multitask
with the best of 'em.

101
00:05:50,704 --> 00:05:51,811
Good to know.

102
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,434
I'm sorry that I knocked you up.

103
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:57,424
It's almost rude, right?

104
00:05:57,544 --> 00:05:59,790
You're kind enough
to grant me access to your...

105
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:02,649
your most intimate of areas,
and what do I do?

106
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,033
I pollinate that shit.

107
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:07,168
I really wish that one of us
would have insisted on a rubber.

108
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,538
One of us did.

109
00:06:08,894 --> 00:06:10,540
- Well, not this one.
- This one.

110
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,975
Well, I mean, let's not get
all Rashomon on it.

111
00:06:13,327 --> 00:06:14,575
If I re... Okay.

112
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,130
- Maybe I didn't insist hard enough.
- Thank you.

113
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:20,301
I'm not gonna press charges anymore.

114
00:06:20,621 --> 00:06:22,547
Wonderful. You see?
Look at this.

115
00:06:22,667 --> 00:06:24,554
We get along really well
for a couple of

116
00:06:25,047 --> 00:06:26,378
virtual strangers.

117
00:06:26,747 --> 00:06:28,889
For now, yeah, but give it 10 years,

118
00:06:29,009 --> 00:06:31,190
and I'll just be another woman
that you got

119
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:33,021
tired of fucking.

120
00:06:34,508 --> 00:06:37,526
You know, in 10 years time,
you might well be the love of my life.

121
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:43,776
- What are you doing?
- He said today, you know?

122
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:46,325
- He said maybe today.
- Today is today.

123
00:06:48,377 --> 00:06:49,996
Will you stop it?
It's gonna be okay.

124
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:53,687
- You don't know that.
- Well, I do, because whatever happens,

125
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:55,121
you know,

126
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,628
we'll get through it.
I'm gonna help you.

127
00:06:57,968 --> 00:06:59,424
But it's not your problem.

128
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,609
We're not even together
right now, so...

129
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:05,344
I forgot what a hypochondriac
drama queen you can be.

130
00:07:05,504 --> 00:07:08,389
You're not the one who just had
a biopsy done on your cock.

131
00:07:08,549 --> 00:07:10,412
That's 'cause I don't have a cock.

132
00:07:10,532 --> 00:07:12,059
Thank the lord for that.

133
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,518
It wasn't on your cock.

134
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:15,271
Yeah, I know, but I consider

135
00:07:15,432 --> 00:07:18,008
that whole area...
general area... my cock.

136
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:20,975
Like, from my knees
to my nipples: cock.

137
00:07:21,145 --> 00:07:25,109
He said it was probably just
a swollen lymph node, remember?

138
00:07:25,234 --> 00:07:26,491
It could be cancer.

139
00:07:26,651 --> 00:07:28,933
- It could be syphilis.
- Oh, shit. Yeah.

140
00:07:29,468 --> 00:07:32,705
I could wind up a blind, dickless beggar
working a 405 off-ramp.

141
00:07:32,865 --> 00:07:34,332
Stop by and say hi sometime.

142
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:38,456
- Look who's here.
- Hey, honey.

143
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:39,864
Are you okay?

144
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,434
Yeah, sure. Yes. Why?

145
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:44,267
Because you're here.

146
00:07:44,729 --> 00:07:46,254
You've been sleeping over.

147
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:49,180
Which could mean you guys
are getting back together.

148
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,516
Or it could mean something's wrong.

149
00:07:52,494 --> 00:07:54,586
Either way,
someone should grow a pair

150
00:07:54,706 --> 00:07:56,145
and tell me what's going on.

151
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,300
We're not getting back together.

152
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:02,501
And everything's fine.

153
00:08:03,604 --> 00:08:04,604
Liars!

154
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:09,909
Seriously.

155
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:13,185
What do you want to do?

156
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:15,655
It's totally up to me?

157
00:08:16,393 --> 00:08:17,616
In a way, it is.

158
00:08:18,927 --> 00:08:20,001
Okay, well,

159
00:08:20,163 --> 00:08:21,941
I'm just gonna deal with it,
you know?

160
00:08:22,061 --> 00:08:24,642
I don't really want
to have a baby right now, and...

161
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,425
Judging by that huge exhalation...

162
00:08:29,547 --> 00:08:31,412
Neither do you, so...

163
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:32,948
that's it.

164
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:36,018
But we can't see each other anymore.

165
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,767
This is no way
to start a relationship.

166
00:08:38,887 --> 00:08:40,388
We're both cheating on people.

167
00:08:40,508 --> 00:08:42,942
It kind of sucks.
I don't want to do that.

168
00:08:43,515 --> 00:08:46,146
So, you go, you know,
take care of your shit,

169
00:08:46,522 --> 00:08:49,428
and I'll take care of mine,
and if and when you want,

170
00:08:49,965 --> 00:08:51,200
you could call me.

171
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:54,476
That's not the way it works
in the big ol' world.

172
00:08:54,601 --> 00:08:57,167
People have a tendency
to lose one another.

173
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:01,076
Well, if that's what happens,
then it wasn't meant to be, right?

174
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,829
Could you stop surfing
the Internet for a diagnosis?

175
00:09:12,954 --> 00:09:15,721
No way. I know what I have
without question.

176
00:09:16,032 --> 00:09:16,945
What?

177
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:19,615
Apparently,
I have the bubonic plague.

178
00:09:21,248 --> 00:09:23,437
Well, guess what?
I have just the cure.

179
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,971
I'm gonna offer you...
a service.

180
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:27,409
Yeah.

181
00:09:27,534 --> 00:09:28,942
Cancer-scare mercy fuck?

182
00:09:29,224 --> 00:09:31,977
You know, I'm gonna pass.

183
00:09:32,102 --> 00:09:33,655
You're gonna pass?
You are?

184
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,658
I don't want you to be
insulted, but...

185
00:09:36,845 --> 00:09:38,722
That's okay.
I can take it.

186
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,340
- I'm gonna go take a shower.
- I'm sorry.

187
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:43,582
Can I ask you,
before you go, a question?

188
00:09:43,785 --> 00:09:46,136
I'm offering you sex,
and you wanna talk?

189
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:47,784
Has the Earth spun off its axis?

190
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,213
It's just, you said that thing
the other day, you know?

191
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:52,135
- What thing?
- About Ashby.

192
00:09:53,299 --> 00:09:54,605
- What do you mean?
- What?

193
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,921
You said that thing
about him being a great kisser,

194
00:09:57,046 --> 00:09:59,787
which kind of sounded like a joke
and kind of not at the same time.

195
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,471
Well, it kind of was a joke
and it kind of wasn't at the same time.

196
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:04,311
I mean, he did kiss me.

197
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,279
- He's a fucking asshole.
- No, not an asshole. He's a child.

198
00:10:08,924 --> 00:10:10,095
He wants what he wants,

199
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,720
and he can't understand
if he doesn't get it.

200
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:15,915
He's... kind of similar
to someone else I know.

201
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,907
There should be
a lot of empathy right there.

202
00:10:18,032 --> 00:10:20,832
- You didn't answer my question.
- What was the question?

203
00:10:20,957 --> 00:10:23,705
Is this something I need to worry about?
Is there something going on?

204
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:25,059
Oh, please.

205
00:10:26,021 --> 00:10:28,096
Don't you have enough
to worry about right now?

206
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:31,171
Will you please stop answering
my questions with a question?

207
00:10:31,517 --> 00:10:33,048
Well, then stop asking me questions.

208
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:35,097
You said it...

209
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,033
We're not together right now.

210
00:10:37,158 --> 00:10:39,766
So I don't owe you any explanation.

211
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:31,597
Come on, buddy. Everybody has
a scare or two in their life.

212
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,844
You remember when they took
that gnarly skin tag

213
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:35,845
off the base of my scrotum
that time?

214
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,252
That amused you greatly.

215
00:11:37,377 --> 00:11:39,345
Well, skin tags
are inherently amusing.

216
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,036
Yes, and disgusting.

217
00:11:41,161 --> 00:11:44,202
It's the Runkle family curse.
Mad skin tags, baby.

218
00:11:45,096 --> 00:11:46,872
You make me want to die.

219
00:11:48,109 --> 00:11:52,220
Anyway, I remember I sweated
that phone call for days, man.

220
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,670
Waiting for the results.

221
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,131
Marcy finally had to bitch-slap
some sense into me at one point.

222
00:11:57,256 --> 00:11:59,033
You will be okay.

223
00:11:59,158 --> 00:12:00,657
Everybody says "You'll be okay".

224
00:12:00,782 --> 00:12:03,406
And then one day, the phone rings,
and you're not okay.

225
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,412
Well, yeah.
There's that.

226
00:12:06,116 --> 00:12:07,894
Hey, look on the bright side...

227
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,025
That girl seems to be
eye-raping you over there.

228
00:12:12,642 --> 00:12:13,661
Well, who cares?

229
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:15,901
You know how much time
I've wasted on that dance?

230
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,943
Time that I could've spent
with my daughter?

231
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:20,781
Hey, hey!
You are a great father.

232
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,285
No! I'm a father.
I am not great.

233
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,031
A great father is a guy
that gives it all up for his family

234
00:12:26,156 --> 00:12:29,094
and leaves his self-destructive
bullshit at the door.

235
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:31,410
The self-loathing is strong
in you today, my friend.

236
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:33,873
I'm just like my father.
You know, there isn't a woman I've met

237
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:36,785
that I haven't fallen in love
with for 10 minutes or 10 years.

238
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,719
What about the one woman
that threw it in with me?

239
00:12:39,844 --> 00:12:41,846
Took that massive leap of faith
just to be with me?

240
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:43,470
What did I do?
I fucked that up.

241
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:44,969
You gave it a shot, man.

242
00:12:45,094 --> 00:12:46,181
- Did I?
- Yeah.

243
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,657
Did I do my absolute best or did I
just want someone I didn't have?

244
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:52,410
Is the chase better than the catch?

245
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:55,052
And other some such clichéd,

246
00:12:55,177 --> 00:12:56,871
masculine bullshit.

247
00:12:57,308 --> 00:12:59,619
There is no absolute best, Hank.

248
00:13:00,096 --> 00:13:04,344
You know, I really envy
your relationship with Marce.

249
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:05,755
You know, it's...

250
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,955
It's like it's indestructible,
you know... Teflon marriage.

251
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,549
Maybe. Doesn't mean
I don't want things.

252
00:13:12,674 --> 00:13:14,709
Yeah, but you know what you have.

253
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:16,364
I don't know...

254
00:13:16,932 --> 00:13:18,665
Faced with my own mortality,

255
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:21,862
I might rather be elsewhere...

256
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:24,135
With Daisy maybe.

257
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:26,910
That's just the mindfuck of the fresh.
It's an illusion.

258
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:29,785
That's just new pussy
talking to you.

259
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,810
What if it's not, huh?

260
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:35,198
Runkle, you better watch
your fucking ass

261
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:38,859
or I will have your balls...
Skin tags and all.

262
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,096
Doctor?

263
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,344
No.

264
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:46,425
It's Ashby.
Fuck him.

265
00:14:20,722 --> 00:14:24,385
You want me to leave the water running?
There's still some hot left.

266
00:14:27,763 --> 00:14:29,359
Yeah, okay, okay.

267
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,369
Beautiful.

268
00:14:32,787 --> 00:14:35,082
What's up with moody?
Haven't seen him for days.

269
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,172
He's not picking up,
returning my calls.

270
00:14:37,557 --> 00:14:38,768
He okay?

271
00:14:39,895 --> 00:14:40,994
Yeah, he...

272
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,132
No. He's got some stuff going on.

273
00:14:44,436 --> 00:14:45,788
Anything I can do?

274
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,995
No. I mean,

275
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,886
he kind of wants
to know what's going on with us,

276
00:14:53,011 --> 00:14:54,707
- which is, like...
- Oh, yeah?

277
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,239
- What is going on with us?
- I told him you were a great kisser,

278
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:00,884
which was kind of dumb.

279
00:15:01,009 --> 00:15:03,272
Well, that is somewhat incendiary.

280
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:06,570
And yet completely true.

281
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:07,905
I wouldn't know.

282
00:15:08,884 --> 00:15:11,159
No, he...
It kind of pissed him off.

283
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,081
Really?
You don't say?

284
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:14,903
Right.

285
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:18,309
You know, I was seeing this guy
when I first met hank,

286
00:15:18,434 --> 00:15:20,627
and he kind of reminds me of you.

287
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:22,548
Oh, yeah?
What was he like?

288
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:24,323
He was simple.

289
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:27,384
"Simple"?
Like... retarded?

290
00:15:27,617 --> 00:15:28,622
Yeah.

291
00:15:28,923 --> 00:15:31,530
No. No, good.
Really good simple.

292
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:32,698
I mean, he was...

293
00:15:33,526 --> 00:15:36,142
He loved music,
he smiled a lot.

294
00:15:37,444 --> 00:15:38,438
Stop it.

295
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,438
Kind of like he had
the secret, you know?

296
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:43,024
- Which is what?
- I guess...

297
00:15:45,051 --> 00:15:47,624
Take the thing you love
and make it your life.

298
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,087
- So, we should kiss?
- No.

299
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,744
Are you insane?
Do you have no memory?

300
00:15:55,042 --> 00:15:56,046
Fucker!

301
00:15:59,696 --> 00:16:00,667
Hank! God!

302
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,699
Hank, stop!

303
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:06,259
Oh, shit!
God!

304
00:16:12,123 --> 00:16:13,371
Okay. I'm out.

305
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:17,559
Bitch!

306
00:16:18,674 --> 00:16:20,139
What are you doing?!

307
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,680
Come on.
You're behaving like a child.

308
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,655
Get off of him!

309
00:16:31,195 --> 00:16:34,533
<i>Hank moody, Dr. Reiss calling.
Give me a call at the office.</i>

310
00:16:35,237 --> 00:16:36,242
Hello?!

311
00:16:40,326 --> 00:16:41,350
Fuck!

312
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,473
Peace.

313
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,940
That's great, Marce.

314
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:49,184
Yes. I accept your apology.

315
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,217
I'm all for the 12 steps.

316
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,282
Love 'em.
Can't get enough of 'em.

317
00:16:53,511 --> 00:16:55,079
Wish there were more.

318
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,361
Sounds great.

319
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:00,572
Can't wait to see you.

320
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,873
Love you, too, baby.
Bye.

321
00:17:10,238 --> 00:17:11,780
"Hey" yourself.

322
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:14,908
I thought I might find you here.

323
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,784
Well, you could've just called.

324
00:17:16,995 --> 00:17:19,413
Oh, I just didn't want to
do this over the phone.

325
00:17:19,898 --> 00:17:21,206
I found a place.

326
00:17:22,546 --> 00:17:23,927
So you're moving out?

327
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:26,034
It's a cute place.

328
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,629
It's just a single,
but it's in Santa Monica.

329
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:31,389
It's pretty close
to the water and close to yoga.

330
00:17:33,835 --> 00:17:35,887
There's something else
I wanted to tell you.

331
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:37,717
And I hope you're not mad.

332
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:40,922
But I don't want to do
any more porn.

333
00:17:41,903 --> 00:17:43,228
I think I'm out.

334
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,457
Really?

335
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:47,524
But you're so good at it.

336
00:17:47,797 --> 00:17:50,050
I don't know,
<i>Vaginatown</i> was special.

337
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,125
I mean, this whole thing
was special.

338
00:17:53,918 --> 00:17:57,788
And, you know, if I can't
actually be with you, Charlie...

339
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,144
I'd kind of like the last person
I had on-screen sex with to be you.

340
00:18:03,642 --> 00:18:06,854
That's, like, one of the nicest things
anyone's ever said to me.

341
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:10,676
And yet totally gross for you.

342
00:18:13,933 --> 00:18:15,593
What are you gonna do?

343
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,760
Temp, waitress...

344
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:20,065
But I'm gonna take acting classes...

345
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:22,100
And maybe some improv.

346
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,234
I know I've got an uphill battle
ahead of me.

347
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:26,488
- What with the fisting and all?
- Exactly.

348
00:18:26,613 --> 00:18:28,839
But it's worth it
'cause I really want this.

349
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:32,151
I'll still manage you
if you'll have me.

350
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:34,810
Are you sure
that's such a good idea?

351
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,197
No.

352
00:18:37,316 --> 00:18:38,321
But...

353
00:18:39,836 --> 00:18:43,830
The thought of never seeing you again
sounds like a much, much worse idea.

354
00:18:47,237 --> 00:18:49,678
Maybe I could see
your place sometime.

355
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,722
I'd like that.

356
00:18:54,683 --> 00:18:57,819
Maybe I could see it... now.

357
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,985
Well, I'd like that even more.

358
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:09,197
- Sorry about your cock.
- It's not my cock.

359
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:11,482
Doesn't matter.
You should've told me.

360
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,476
I trained as a paramedic.
I could've helped.

361
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:14,858
Oh, yeah? Like how?

362
00:19:16,249 --> 00:19:17,913
I don't know.
I could've...

363
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:20,758
felt around,
put your mind at ease.

364
00:19:21,002 --> 00:19:22,076
Maybe next time.

365
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,273
Look, I'm sorry
I kissed your old lady.

366
00:19:27,773 --> 00:19:29,125
I'm sorry I kissed yours.

367
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,066
You fucking asshole.
Did you penetrate?

368
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:32,371
Did I go inside? No.

369
00:19:32,512 --> 00:19:35,176
Friends don't let friends
bang each other's soul mates.

370
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,967
"A-fucking-men" to that.

371
00:19:39,663 --> 00:19:40,781
Be good.

372
00:19:45,432 --> 00:19:47,792
- Sorry about the mess.
- It's okay.

373
00:19:48,675 --> 00:19:50,790
Hank, you're my best friend.

374
00:19:51,413 --> 00:19:54,612
I would never, ever fuck someone
to get back at you.

375
00:19:55,038 --> 00:19:56,736
I know. That's the thing.

376
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,372
If you fuck someone, you really want
to fuck them. That's what scares me.

377
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:04,476
Well, what do you really want?
I mean, how do you want this to end?

378
00:20:04,601 --> 00:20:07,942
I want to keep doing this
for as much time as we have left.

379
00:20:08,067 --> 00:20:09,368
Not cleaning up.

380
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:11,501
This.

381
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,505
Isn't that, like,
what we've been doing?

382
00:20:15,842 --> 00:20:19,299
I don't know if we have.
I mean, we've talked about it endlessly,

383
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:22,688
and we've listed all the reasons
why it's not possible,

384
00:20:22,813 --> 00:20:25,669
but what if all those reasons
just magically went away?

385
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:27,949
That's the problem, they never do.

386
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:30,854
Okay, you've got one month left.

387
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:33,697
- What do you do? How do you spend it?
- With Becca.

388
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:35,233
No Hank in there?

389
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,652
I don't fit in anywhere in there?

390
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:39,103
No Hank?

391
00:20:39,982 --> 00:20:43,269
- Maybe a couple of days.
- Fair enough, but for me...

392
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:46,563
I want you there at the end.

393
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:49,621
I want those eyes to be
the last thing that I see.

394
00:20:53,302 --> 00:20:56,156
- You know what it is about Lew?
- No. I don't.

395
00:20:56,743 --> 00:20:58,876
He made a choice. He chose art.

396
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:00,758
He made that his life.

397
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,801
And that's okay.
That's valid.

398
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,221
But with you...

399
00:21:06,156 --> 00:21:08,396
You can't figure out
who you want to be,

400
00:21:08,993 --> 00:21:11,788
you know? It's your indecision
that paralyzes you

401
00:21:11,913 --> 00:21:13,354
and hurts us, Hank.

402
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:15,756
I can feel your restlessness.

403
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,709
I mean, a moment like this,
yeah, you want me, you want us.

404
00:21:19,834 --> 00:21:23,322
And then that moment passes,
and you become like this ghost.

405
00:21:24,113 --> 00:21:27,076
14 years ago, "I love you"
was more than enough.

406
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:29,916
I mean, it was almost revolutionary.

407
00:21:30,993 --> 00:21:32,036
And now...

408
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:35,297
I don't know.
They're just words.

409
00:21:36,231 --> 00:21:38,500
I mean, I know you mean them, but...

410
00:21:39,647 --> 00:21:41,967
I don't know what they mean to you.

411
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,472
You want to be saved?

412
00:21:57,782 --> 00:21:58,782
Hello?

413
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,468
Hey, Dr. Reiss.

414
00:22:02,552 --> 00:22:03,623
How are you?

415
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:09,644
All right. Well...

416
00:22:13,691 --> 00:22:15,505
- What?
- You were right.

417
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,436
- What?
- Syphilis.

418
00:22:18,925 --> 00:22:20,644
- Bullshit.
- It's benign.

419
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:22,209
You know, just...

420
00:22:22,901 --> 00:22:25,287
Antibiotics is all I need,
and then...

421
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:28,631
- I'm gonna be okay.
- That's fantastic.

422
00:22:28,866 --> 00:22:29,972
You're okay.

423
00:22:30,961 --> 00:22:31,961
For now.

424
00:22:37,291 --> 00:22:39,356
- Want to give me that...
- No.

425
00:22:39,481 --> 00:22:42,720
- Post-cancer-scare mercy fuck now?
- No. It's too late.

426
00:22:46,974 --> 00:22:48,664
So, this is it, I guess?

427
00:22:52,824 --> 00:22:54,355
I guess so. Yeah.

428
00:22:55,672 --> 00:22:56,749
Can I call you?

429
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,072
No, really, I'd rather you didn't.

430
00:23:01,197 --> 00:23:03,572
Will you call me,
you know, just to...

431
00:23:03,697 --> 00:23:05,383
Let me know you're okay?

432
00:23:06,225 --> 00:23:07,699
Yeah. I'll call you.

433
00:23:09,447 --> 00:23:10,796
No, you won't...

434
00:23:11,569 --> 00:23:12,723
But I get it.

435
00:23:13,819 --> 00:23:14,846
It was...

436
00:23:16,223 --> 00:23:18,271
It was...
It was awfully nice sharing

437
00:23:19,117 --> 00:23:21,566
this most unpleasant
of milestones with you.

438
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,270
Yeah. Same here.

439
00:23:27,338 --> 00:23:29,266
Don't get lost out there, okay?

440
00:24:06,504 --> 00:24:08,795
I was gonna go check out that vigil

441
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,920
of...

442
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:11,653
Kurt Cobain.

443
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:15,936
I don't know.
Did you want to come?

444
00:24:16,061 --> 00:24:17,915
- The Cobain vigil?
- Yeah.

445
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,678
I got a vigil

446
00:24:20,601 --> 00:24:22,233
that I was already...

447
00:24:22,823 --> 00:24:24,888
- No, seriously. Yeah?
- Yeah.

448
00:24:26,005 --> 00:24:28,419
I don't know if you know this
about me, but...

449
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:30,157
I love vigils.

450
00:24:30,701 --> 00:24:32,303
I kind of guessed that.

451
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:36,848
<i>Dear, Karen,
If you're reading this,</i>

452
00:24:36,973 --> 00:24:39,601
<i>it means I actually worked up
the courage to mail it.</i>

453
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,131
<i>So, good for me.</i>

454
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,816
<i>You don't know me very well,
but if you get me started,</i>

455
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:48,568
<i>I have a tendency to go on and on
about how hard the writing is for me.</i>

456
00:24:49,493 --> 00:24:50,548
<i>But this...</i>

457
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:54,551
<i>This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to write.</i>

458
00:24:55,371 --> 00:24:57,980
<i>There's no easy way to say this,
so I'll just say it.</i>

459
00:24:58,105 --> 00:24:59,258
<i>I met someone.</i>

460
00:24:59,867 --> 00:25:01,082
<i>It was an accident.</i>

461
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:03,743
<i>I wasn't looking for it.
I wasn't on the make.</i>

462
00:25:03,868 --> 00:25:05,409
<i>It was a perfect storm.</i>

463
00:25:05,534 --> 00:25:08,783
<i>She said one thing. I said another.
Next thing I knew,</i>

464
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:12,500
<i>I wanted to spend the rest of my life
in the middle of that conversation.</i>

465
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,059
<i>Now there's this feeling in my gut</i>

466
00:25:17,184 --> 00:25:18,739
<i>she might be the one.</i>

467
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,004
<i>She's completely nuts</i>

468
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,688
<i>in a way that makes me smile.
Highly neurotic.</i>

469
00:25:25,173 --> 00:25:27,544
<i>A great deal of maintenance
required.</i>

470
00:25:28,113 --> 00:25:29,542
<i>She is you, Karen.</i>

471
00:25:30,963 --> 00:25:32,530
<i>That's the good news.</i>

472
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:37,700
<i>The bad is that I don't know
how to be with you right now.</i>

473
00:25:38,274 --> 00:25:39,912
<i>And it scares the shit out of me.</i>

474
00:25:40,574 --> 00:25:42,730
<i>Because if I'm not with you
right now,</i>

475
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:45,126
<i>I have this feeling
we'll get lost out there.</i>

476
00:25:48,257 --> 00:25:51,167
<i>It's a big, bad world
full of twists and turns,</i>

477
00:25:51,437 --> 00:25:54,814
<i>and people have a way of blinking
and missing the moment.</i>

478
00:25:56,373 --> 00:25:59,134
<i>The moment that could've
changed everything.</i>

479
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,271
<i>I don't know
what's going on with us,</i>

480
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,639
<i>and I can't tell you why
you should waste a leap of faith</i>

481
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,267
<i>on the likes of me.</i>

482
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:11,689
<i>But, damn, you smell good...</i>

483
00:26:11,814 --> 00:26:12,814
<i>Like home.</i>

484
00:26:13,293 --> 00:26:15,054
<i>And you make excellent coffee.</i>

485
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,402
<i>That's got to count for something,
right?</i>

486
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:19,544
<i>Call me.</i>

487
00:26:20,471 --> 00:26:22,739
<i>Unfaithfully yours, Hank Moody.</i>
