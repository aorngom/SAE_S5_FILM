1
00:00:01,627 --> 00:00:03,957
I don't think you heard me.
I wrote something.

2
00:00:04,226 --> 00:00:07,286
- Hank wrote a new book? Can I read it?
- That's not appropriate.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,101
I gave it to Karen.
She reads all my stuff first.

4
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:12,257
- Is there a copy?
- It's the only one.

5
00:00:12,423 --> 00:00:13,529
I can't read it.

6
00:00:13,669 --> 00:00:15,345
- Why not?
- I can't go back.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,805
- I wanna go back where we were before.
- I don't think that's possible.

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,841
What the fuck?

9
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:23,135
I'm getting a bad feeling here.

10
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:26,855
I'm thinking you intend to give that
to someone who might already be engaged.

11
00:00:27,085 --> 00:00:28,445
We had the sex, Karen.

12
00:00:28,658 --> 00:00:30,400
I don't love you anymore.

13
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,835
I love Bill. I'm gonna marry Bill.

14
00:00:33,005 --> 00:00:34,704
Get the fuck out of the car, man!

15
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:38,585
- Let me just grab this.
- No! Get the fuck out!

16
00:00:40,394 --> 00:00:41,566
Shut the fuck up!

17
00:00:52,682 --> 00:00:56,873
Subtitles: swsub.com

18
00:00:57,487 --> 00:00:58,697
Kiss the tip!

19
00:01:16,848 --> 00:01:18,239
What up, butterbean?

20
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:22,077
Hey, roomie. Top of the morning to you.
How about this beautiful

21
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:24,204
fucking weather we're having here.

22
00:01:24,344 --> 00:01:28,194
It looks like another sunny day
in hell. What the fuck are you doing?

23
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:31,098
Now that I'm gonna be competing
for all this high-end pussy,

24
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:34,170
I gotta try to get this body in
to some kind of fighting shape.

25
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:36,415
That is a fool's errand, my friend.

26
00:01:37,505 --> 00:01:39,464
- Don't be hating.
- Take it from somebody

27
00:01:39,604 --> 00:01:42,974
who's been there. That shit
is emptier than a Michael Bay joint.

28
00:01:43,247 --> 00:01:45,557
You're just over it now,
all of a sudden?

29
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:50,628
You know, new pussy may hold
the promise of something better,

30
00:01:51,313 --> 00:01:53,012
but it sure as shit ain't love.

31
00:01:54,241 --> 00:01:57,624
Great. So I shuck off the old ball and chain,
and you get thee to a nunnery.

32
00:01:57,768 --> 00:01:59,376
- Perfect timing.
- And Marce?

33
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,480
I know you miss the Marce, right?
That sexy little smurf was good to you.

34
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,705
The sexy little smurf cheated on me
with my assistant.

35
00:02:06,957 --> 00:02:09,026
But you cheated on her
with your assistant

36
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:10,917
- first.
- Point being?

37
00:02:11,177 --> 00:02:14,789
- Your shit's fucked up.
- My shit's fucked up? What about yours?

38
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:16,870
That goes without saying,
but yours more.

39
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,556
Good, this is what I like
about having a roommate.

40
00:02:19,735 --> 00:02:23,127
We got the banter going.
We got the <i>petits bons mots.</i>

41
00:02:26,557 --> 00:02:29,186
- What you got going on later?
- I don't know...

42
00:02:29,326 --> 00:02:33,170
I thought I'd start the day with some
dry toast and half a grapefruit,

43
00:02:33,383 --> 00:02:37,164
bust out the old computer, bang out
10 pages, maybe go for a run.

44
00:02:38,255 --> 00:02:40,530
Maybe I'll just jerk off
and go back to bed.

45
00:02:40,792 --> 00:02:43,645
Wake me up when you come home.
We'll grab a cocktail, alright?

46
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:45,505
Have a good day at work, honey.

47
00:02:47,665 --> 00:02:51,063
I was thinking, later, me and you...
We hit the gym. Tonight.

48
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:54,597
Jesus, enough already.
Just call your fucking wife.

49
00:02:54,743 --> 00:02:58,125
Do whatever you have to do. Beg,
plead, cry. Get down on bended knee.

50
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,537
'cause I'm telling you,
no top-shelf pussy

51
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:03,559
- can compete with a good woman's love.
- Top shelf.

52
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:05,137
Top shelf, baby.

53
00:03:05,277 --> 00:03:07,779
Jesus. Alright.
I'll go to the gym with you.

54
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:10,670
But I'm not wearing any dolphin shorts
or hanging any brain,

55
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,106
so don't get your hopes up.

56
00:04:01,613 --> 00:04:03,580
You have a meeting
with your friend's daughter.

57
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:06,016
- She wants to be a writer.
- Not in the mood.

58
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:08,493
- Reschedule.
- Okay, no problem.

59
00:04:09,677 --> 00:04:11,120
You got a minute, boss?

60
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:15,954
"Boss,"? I thought you were moving on.
When is your 2 weeks' notice up, anyway?

61
00:04:16,794 --> 00:04:21,089
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Things have gotten a little weird.

62
00:04:22,314 --> 00:04:23,722
Oh, really?

63
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:26,344
They weren't always a little weird?

64
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:28,304
You didn't do anything wrong.

65
00:04:29,007 --> 00:04:31,199
I went after something I wanted.
I started it.

66
00:04:31,419 --> 00:04:34,193
That's right. That's...
You started it.

67
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:37,628
And that's where free will comes in.
Choices were made, boss.

68
00:04:39,328 --> 00:04:42,110
I get your point.
So what's your choice?

69
00:04:42,475 --> 00:04:43,772
I want to stay.

70
00:04:43,912 --> 00:04:46,817
I want to learn from you.
I want to be an agent.

71
00:04:46,957 --> 00:04:51,270
I see. So, first, you systematically
destroy my marriage,

72
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:53,940
and now you want me
to help with your career.

73
00:04:54,144 --> 00:04:55,872
Well, fuck you

74
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:57,784
and fuck off!

75
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:02,550
OK, fair enough. I guess I'll just have
to look elsewhere for career guidance.

76
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:05,883
Maybe I'll start with H.R.
I bet they'd love to help,

77
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,091
especially when I told them
what I went through on your desk.

78
00:05:09,355 --> 00:05:11,768
The spanking,
the crawling on the floor,

79
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,006
the sexual humiliation...

80
00:05:14,983 --> 00:05:17,201
Seems you've got
the makings of an excellent agent.

81
00:05:17,676 --> 00:05:19,022
So where do I start?

82
00:05:19,828 --> 00:05:22,837
You start by going through
that slush pile over there.

83
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:26,205
Find me some great material.
Something I can sell.

84
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,149
You can't smoke in here.

85
00:05:37,643 --> 00:05:39,893
What are you gonna do, kick my ass?

86
00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:43,690
Hank, right?

87
00:05:44,034 --> 00:05:45,340
Yeah. Have we met?

88
00:05:45,516 --> 00:05:48,190
You gotta get in the ring.
This is fucking exhilarating.

89
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:50,471
I think I'm good.

90
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:53,961
- Pussy.
- Excuse me?

91
00:05:54,617 --> 00:05:56,920
You heard me.
I called you a pussy.

92
00:05:57,577 --> 00:06:00,079
You afraid to get your ass handed to you
by a woman?

93
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:02,558
Actually,
I'm in touch with that emotion.

94
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,317
What are you doing later?

95
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:06,471
Would you like
to get a drink with two guys

96
00:06:06,611 --> 00:06:09,364
who'll work harder for your affection
than you imagined possible?

97
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,564
- Speak for yourself.
- That depends.

98
00:06:11,834 --> 00:06:12,834
On what?

99
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:16,790
On whether or not your buddy over here
wants to get in the ring with me.

100
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:27,382
Hi. I've got a meeting
with Charlie Runkle.

101
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,142
Mia. I'm so sorry.
I know it's last-minute,

102
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:34,502
but he had to reschedule.
I tried to call you.

103
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:37,646
But my phone died.
Sorry, my bad.

104
00:06:41,586 --> 00:06:45,321
I'm sure Charlie would love to
reschedule at your earliest convenience.

105
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,206
Right. Fine.

106
00:06:48,468 --> 00:06:49,961
That's fine. Whatever.

107
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,147
Is there anything
I can help you with?

108
00:06:52,398 --> 00:06:54,293
- Are you an agent?
- Not yet.

109
00:06:54,743 --> 00:06:56,360
But I will be soon.

110
00:06:56,831 --> 00:06:59,992
Well, I wrote this novel,
and I was just wondering

111
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:02,492
if Charlie would read it
and give me some notes,

112
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:05,719
- let me know if I'm on the right track.
- How old are you?

113
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,859
Sixteen.

114
00:07:07,065 --> 00:07:10,696
And you've written a novel.
That's impressive. What's it about?

115
00:07:11,024 --> 00:07:13,384
A 16-year-old girl
fucks a much older man

116
00:07:13,581 --> 00:07:16,264
and finds herself both
spiritually and sexually awakened.

117
00:07:16,446 --> 00:07:19,538
It's Nabokov meets Judy Blume
with lots of fucking and punching.

118
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,076
What's it called?

119
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:23,168
<i>Fucking & Punching.</i>

120
00:07:24,338 --> 00:07:26,834
- I'd be happy to read it.
- You would?

121
00:07:27,424 --> 00:07:30,273
- Cool.
- I'll give you a call when I'm done.

122
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,690
And we could meet
for coffee or something.

123
00:07:33,499 --> 00:07:37,331
You might want to read it now.
You might not get another chance to.

124
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:39,072
It's up to you.

125
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:42,324
I'll be in here checking my e-mail.
Enjoy.

126
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,163
I'm sorry, I just can't place you.

127
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,298
The Circle Bar...

128
00:07:56,229 --> 00:07:57,425
About a year ago.

129
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:01,096
You bought me a drink

130
00:08:01,273 --> 00:08:03,241
and I spent the night
in your apartment,

131
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:04,675
doing things

132
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:07,130
I haven't done with anyone since.

133
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,185
You promised to call.

134
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,057
You didn't.

135
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:13,927
- Okay. That was low.
- Sorry.

136
00:08:16,872 --> 00:08:18,944
Now I'm gonna have
to deduct a point.

137
00:08:21,245 --> 00:08:22,578
You're starting to...

138
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:24,986
... look familiar.

139
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:27,606
Let me make it up to you.

140
00:08:27,824 --> 00:08:30,891
Let me take you out to dinner
sometime or maybe get a drink.

141
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:34,838
Sure. After I beat
the living shit out of you.

142
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:38,083
Okay, now I'm thinking
I should wear a cup to dinner.

143
00:08:49,082 --> 00:08:51,585
You really should've called her.
She seemed angry.

144
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:52,855
You think?

145
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,849
Another Vodka-Cranberry.

146
00:08:55,394 --> 00:08:56,221
Fag.

147
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:58,731
I can't drink like you, okay?

148
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,355
I need something sweet
to help the medicine go down.

149
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,238
Faggoty fag fag fag.

150
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:06,957
This is cool, us hanging out here.

151
00:09:07,181 --> 00:09:10,488
Just like... Raoul Duke
and Dr. Gonzo, right?

152
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:14,041
- Haven't done it since the salad days.
- When you used me to get laid.

153
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:16,031
Like when you used me
to get published.

154
00:09:16,171 --> 00:09:18,959
- That worked, didn't it?
- For you, maybe. Not so much for me.

155
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:20,536
It worked for me.

156
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:23,977
And I never really got to sow
the wild oats the way I would've liked.

157
00:09:24,138 --> 00:09:25,765
I was always too busy working.

158
00:09:27,255 --> 00:09:29,198
And now you're haunted by it?

159
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:30,678
It's a pretty drink.

160
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:34,225
Most people go their whole life
and never really find someone they love.

161
00:09:34,497 --> 00:09:36,785
They say they do because
everybody's the star

162
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:39,648
of their own little romantic comedy,
but they're full of shit.

163
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:42,699
You and me, we had women
that loved us for who we were,

164
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,013
<i>really</i> loved us for who we were,
and we fucked it up.

165
00:09:46,536 --> 00:09:50,398
For what? Some stupid piece of ass
we forgot about 10 minutes later?

166
00:09:50,554 --> 00:09:53,877
You're fun tonight.
Just don't worry so much, all right?

167
00:09:54,105 --> 00:09:57,604
Everything's gonna work itself out.
It's just a phase we're going through.

168
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:08,809
Yeah. That's fantastic.

169
00:10:09,272 --> 00:10:11,025
Okay. See you there.

170
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:14,244
That was Laura. From the gym.

171
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:17,606
- Shit. I just peed myself.
- Tap, tap, tap on the shoulder.

172
00:10:17,782 --> 00:10:20,611
- She wants to meet us at your place.
- Ding. Round 2.

173
00:10:20,772 --> 00:10:22,972
No, I quit. <i>No más. No más.</i>

174
00:10:24,837 --> 00:10:26,715
- Are you finished yet?
- Hold on.

175
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:29,715
It's just a novella.
Are you one of those people

176
00:10:29,855 --> 00:10:33,796
who move their lips when they read?
'Cause that can really slow you down.

177
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:35,765
So...?

178
00:10:36,176 --> 00:10:37,534
Are you really 16?

179
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:39,031
I'm really 16.

180
00:10:39,443 --> 00:10:41,126
Who are your influences?

181
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:43,060
I don't know...

182
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,697
Chuck Palahniuk...

183
00:10:45,871 --> 00:10:46,960
Nick Cave...

184
00:10:47,549 --> 00:10:49,172
Anything Hank Moody...

185
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:51,627
This is really good.

186
00:10:51,855 --> 00:10:53,767
Don't blow smoke up my snatch.

187
00:10:54,034 --> 00:10:55,694
- I'm not.
- You really think

188
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:58,502
- I've got something here?
- I really do, yeah.

189
00:10:58,653 --> 00:10:59,510
Cool.

190
00:11:00,388 --> 00:11:01,852
Thanks for reading.

191
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:03,871
Where are you going?

192
00:11:04,573 --> 00:11:06,663
You just confirmed
what I already knew.

193
00:11:06,862 --> 00:11:10,689
Why waste it on a tired warhorse
who cancels meetings at the last second?

194
00:11:10,865 --> 00:11:12,066
I can help you.

195
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,416
Give me a break.
You're just an assistant.

196
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,283
For now, but not for long.

197
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:19,828
Would you rather be with someone who's
on their way up or on their way out?

198
00:11:29,109 --> 00:11:30,801
Oh, no. Look at this.

199
00:11:31,823 --> 00:11:33,879
- This is awkward.
- For you, maybe.

200
00:11:34,752 --> 00:11:36,970
- What, no kiss?
- I'm through with that.

201
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:39,449
You want me,
you know where to find me.

202
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,969
You, on the other hand, little lady,

203
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:44,476
have been a very naughty
little smurf.

204
00:11:44,844 --> 00:11:46,431
Bi-curious, are we?

205
00:11:46,755 --> 00:11:49,774
Hey, he started it.
Spanking his assistant.

206
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:51,605
What happened to your face?

207
00:11:53,222 --> 00:11:56,796
- Kicked in the ass by karma.
- I'm not a lesbian, by the way.

208
00:11:56,946 --> 00:11:58,867
Says the girl
with her finger in the dyke.

209
00:11:59,010 --> 00:11:59,881
Nice.

210
00:12:02,542 --> 00:12:03,610
Witty. Clever.

211
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,453
We're on a serious break here.

212
00:12:05,689 --> 00:12:07,736
You could do
whatever the fuck you want.

213
00:12:07,915 --> 00:12:10,851
Get all the stank on your hang-low
you could get. Go for broke.

214
00:12:11,108 --> 00:12:14,417
Don't think I won't do it. With this guy
as my wingman, I can't fail.

215
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:15,859
Sure you can.

216
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:19,527
No. Do not underestimate
your inability to attract women.

217
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,218
Just keeping it real.

218
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,505
I don't know about you, but I'm getting
tired of these vagina haters.

219
00:12:27,689 --> 00:12:29,652
I enjoy the vagina.
As much as you.

220
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:32,718
Once upon a time, we would've
all gone in here together.

221
00:12:32,858 --> 00:12:35,901
- All of us. To have a good time.
- Step aside, asswipes.

222
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:37,790
What the fuck happened to us?

223
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:39,195
Good times.

224
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:43,626
I have to ask. Why does she punch him
in the face just as he's about to cum?

225
00:12:44,923 --> 00:12:46,167
You tell me.

226
00:12:47,002 --> 00:12:49,224
I think maybe
she wants to wake him up.

227
00:12:49,656 --> 00:12:52,034
Or maybe she's trying
to make sure he remembers her.

228
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:54,367
Or maybe it's just really hot.

229
00:12:54,507 --> 00:12:56,930
Whatever happened
to "just plain hot"?

230
00:12:58,276 --> 00:13:00,011
What do your parents make of this?

231
00:13:01,324 --> 00:13:03,881
Well, my dad
doesn't pay much attention.

232
00:13:04,407 --> 00:13:07,793
I mean, he means well,
you know, he just works... a lot.

233
00:13:08,884 --> 00:13:11,379
And my mom... she's gone.

234
00:13:12,071 --> 00:13:15,458
She got sick
a few years back and... died.

235
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:19,242
Let me help you with this.

236
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:22,442
- Why?
- Because I believe in your writing.

237
00:13:23,267 --> 00:13:26,700
This thing is gonna be huge.
Can you imagine the headlines?

238
00:13:27,034 --> 00:13:30,995
"16-year-old girl writes smartest,
sexiest book since "Lolita".

239
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:33,560
It'll be made into a movie.

240
00:13:33,768 --> 00:13:36,246
Maybe Hank Moody
could write the screenplay?

241
00:13:36,599 --> 00:13:37,425
Yeah.

242
00:13:38,293 --> 00:13:40,855
I can't figure out
what happened to the poor guy.

243
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:42,897
I mean, he was such a great writer.

244
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:53,886
Let me let you in on
a little secret, young lady. You...

245
00:13:54,082 --> 00:13:56,390
are much more talented
than you think you are.

246
00:13:56,538 --> 00:13:59,396
You wanna be an actress?
I could have you working in no time.

247
00:13:59,938 --> 00:14:02,400
- Really? So you'd take me on?
- In a heartbeat.

248
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:05,187
You're beautiful,
you're smart, you're funny,

249
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,498
and you can kick a man's ass
no problem.

250
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:10,040
- Got that right.
- Oh, not in the face!

251
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:11,302
Shit.

252
00:14:11,463 --> 00:14:14,055
OK, that's it for me.
Good night and good luck.

253
00:14:14,225 --> 00:14:15,033
Wait.

254
00:14:15,352 --> 00:14:17,802
Not so fast.
What about my goodnight kiss?

255
00:14:18,534 --> 00:14:19,535
Good night.

256
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:24,299
Be careful.

257
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,771
Remember me now?

258
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:39,640
I don't care what you think.

259
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,166
I just don't think
the punishment fits the crime.

260
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:44,608
I'm sorry that I don't remember you,

261
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,392
I'm sorry
that I didn't call you back.

262
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,176
I just think
that I had a very good reason.

263
00:14:51,221 --> 00:14:52,777
But you can't remember it?

264
00:14:53,172 --> 00:14:56,477
I'm gonna go to bed now.
You have fun. You two have fun.

265
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:58,097
There you go.

266
00:14:58,447 --> 00:15:00,307
Now, I want you guys to be safe,

267
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:04,272
be responsible, use redundant forms
of birth control,

268
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,373
but mainly, just keep it down,

269
00:15:06,552 --> 00:15:09,856
because I'm gonna be back there
trying to piss blood in peace.

270
00:15:10,223 --> 00:15:12,065
<i>Carry on, my wayward sons.</i>

271
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:17,454
Do you know how hard it is
to get a <i>girl</i> off?

272
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:19,560
It is like disconnecting a bomb.

273
00:15:19,727 --> 00:15:22,289
I mean, there's all these
wires and shit down there.

274
00:15:22,523 --> 00:15:25,691
Who knows which one you're
supposed to cross or pull.

275
00:15:25,954 --> 00:15:27,593
Plus, the studies show

276
00:15:27,785 --> 00:15:31,260
that the female orgasm
is, like, what, 99% mental.

277
00:15:31,433 --> 00:15:34,520
- Who has time for that?
- Okay, so that's good.

278
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,877
So you wanna go back to
the 4-minute grunt-fest?

279
00:15:37,017 --> 00:15:38,528
Things like in, out, done.

280
00:15:39,936 --> 00:15:42,043
Give me a mouthful of cock any day.

281
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,898
- Right.
- Suck, gargle, spit

282
00:15:45,532 --> 00:15:49,288
works like a charm.
I mean, call me old-fashioned, but...

283
00:15:49,757 --> 00:15:53,044
So, you're done with
the lesbitarian experiment.

284
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:56,974
The grass is always greener,
you know?

285
00:15:57,319 --> 00:15:59,963
Isn't that how you ended up
engaged to be buried?

286
00:16:01,151 --> 00:16:03,033
No Bill-bashing. You promised me.

287
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:05,888
- Stay on the subject.
- That is the subject.

288
00:16:06,114 --> 00:16:08,167
Married people
bored out of their minds,

289
00:16:08,341 --> 00:16:09,791
looking for some strange.

290
00:16:09,951 --> 00:16:12,253
It never solves what was wrong
in the first place.

291
00:16:12,456 --> 00:16:14,608
Like you're such a fucking expert.

292
00:16:14,902 --> 00:16:18,816
I'm gonna tell you one thing.
That lying, cheating little cocksucker

293
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:21,089
is not moving back into my house

294
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,294
until I see some real fucking
remorse-itude, okay?

295
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,124
I want tears. I want jewelry.

296
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,470
Hank never bought me any jewelry.

297
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:32,513
Not then, no.
But he bought you that ring, didn't he?

298
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,110
What ring?

299
00:16:35,038 --> 00:16:35,868
Fuck.

300
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:39,528
I spoiled the fucking
surprise, didn't I?

301
00:16:39,671 --> 00:16:41,468
- What fucking surprise?
- Shit.

302
00:16:41,679 --> 00:16:44,094
I'm getting married.
Why would Hank buy me a ring?

303
00:16:44,272 --> 00:16:45,475
I don't know.

304
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,245
Charlie mentioned that...

305
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:49,911
he was on some kind of roll,
he got a bonus from the movie,

306
00:16:50,072 --> 00:16:52,980
and then he went and blew it
on some antique ring.

307
00:16:53,309 --> 00:16:55,761
Don't tell me that. What, for me?

308
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:57,856
Of course for you.

309
00:16:57,997 --> 00:17:01,008
That's the kind of bling you like,
right? Dead people's jewelry?

310
00:17:02,595 --> 00:17:05,477
Wait. What kind of ring
did Bill get you, again?

311
00:17:06,002 --> 00:17:07,399
That's right. None.

312
00:17:07,578 --> 00:17:09,097
It's on order, okay?

313
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,252
It's very special.

314
00:17:11,552 --> 00:17:13,230
It's a Canadian diamond.

315
00:17:15,181 --> 00:17:18,014
Are they good with
the diamonds, the Canadians?

316
00:17:18,197 --> 00:17:20,021
I thought just the bacon.

317
00:17:24,131 --> 00:17:26,749
- I need a favor.
- And I need some sleep. Go away.

318
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:29,702
- I'm getting close out here.
- Close to what?

319
00:17:29,981 --> 00:17:31,339
Sealing the deal.

320
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:32,933
With lady Tyson?

321
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:36,821
- Good luck. Keep your hands up, though.
- Here's the thing, okay?

322
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:38,824
She seems amenable
to the naughty, OK?

323
00:17:39,023 --> 00:17:41,616
But she seems even more amenable
if you're part of it.

324
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,998
I think she's got kind of
a thing for you.

325
00:17:44,152 --> 00:17:46,957
No, I'm not going for that.
I've already given that girl

326
00:17:47,098 --> 00:17:48,963
enough of my precious bodily fluids.

327
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:52,107
Hey, Hank, I think you need
to take one for the team here.

328
00:17:52,302 --> 00:17:53,679
What team is that?

329
00:17:53,911 --> 00:17:56,370
The team of you and me,
buddy, alright?

330
00:17:56,511 --> 00:17:58,990
My wife is out there
trolling for snatch, OK?

331
00:17:59,194 --> 00:18:01,624
Meanwhile, I've stumbled
onto some high-class,

332
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:03,788
once-in-a-lifetime fantasy shit here.

333
00:18:03,928 --> 00:18:06,526
This kind of thing
doesn't happen for me every day.

334
00:18:06,798 --> 00:18:08,740
No, I am aware,
and I feel your pain.

335
00:18:08,892 --> 00:18:10,880
But there's no way
I'm gonna take a chance

336
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,998
of crossing swords with you
over some poor girl's "vajanus."

337
00:18:14,190 --> 00:18:16,044
Alright. That's cool. I get it.

338
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,477
I'll go out there
and give it my best shot.

339
00:18:18,717 --> 00:18:21,187
If it doesn't happen,
another time, right?

340
00:18:21,341 --> 00:18:23,681
If not then,
there's always call girls,

341
00:18:23,941 --> 00:18:27,462
interactive porn, plastic vaginas.
Thanks, buddy. I feel much better now.

342
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:29,293
Fuck it, Charlie. Okay.

343
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:31,360
Okay. I'll do it.

344
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:34,783
First, let's set some guidelines.

345
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,584
Excellent idea! Excellent.
What? What are you thinking?

346
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:38,655
First,

347
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:42,116
I don't want to see your cock
anywhere near me.

348
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:45,973
Why would I <i>want</i> my cock
anywhere near you?

349
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,610
Why would you wanna be
involved in a threesome with me?

350
00:18:48,771 --> 00:18:51,282
- I don't. My client does.
- <i>This</i> client doesn't.

351
00:18:51,612 --> 00:18:54,475
<i>That</i> client, the new client.
Do you want to do this?

352
00:18:54,834 --> 00:18:58,682
No. But I will. For you.
Anything for you, my love.

353
00:19:00,924 --> 00:19:03,799
- Go agent the deal. I'll freshen up.
- I need to...

354
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:06,456
Go make it so. Make it so.

355
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:13,725
Alright. I'm good. Bring it on.

356
00:19:18,347 --> 00:19:20,938
I should get going. I have to
get up for work in the morning.

357
00:19:21,218 --> 00:19:24,497
Think about what I said.
I'd love to work with you on this.

358
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:26,143
Well...

359
00:19:31,045 --> 00:19:32,105
Here you go.

360
00:19:34,578 --> 00:19:35,974
Make shit happen.

361
00:19:36,934 --> 00:19:38,207
Oh, I will.

362
00:19:41,522 --> 00:19:42,631
Let's do it.

363
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,873
- Okay, where to, bitch?
- Totally up to you, slunt.

364
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,329
God, I miss you.

365
00:19:55,579 --> 00:19:57,389
- I fucking miss you!
- I miss you.

366
00:19:57,621 --> 00:19:59,481
- I miss you.
- I love you.

367
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:03,564
I miss all of us.

368
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:06,552
Me and you and Hank and Charlie.

369
00:20:07,615 --> 00:20:10,621
That first year you guys were
out here, that was magic.

370
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:16,290
The drinking, the dinners,
the movies, the smoking, the "X."

371
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:21,136
That time we almost did swap
but Charlie got hives.

372
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,538
Good times.

373
00:20:25,884 --> 00:20:26,884
You know,

374
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:29,681
morsel, it can be like that again.

375
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,436
No offense, sweetie,
but I don't want

376
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:35,264
- to do that kind of stuff with Bill.
- Why not?

377
00:20:35,533 --> 00:20:39,358
I don't know. He just kind of makes
my labia shrivel.

378
00:20:39,624 --> 00:20:41,627
Thank you for that nice image.

379
00:20:42,008 --> 00:20:43,385
I'm sorry. I just...

380
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:46,912
I miss my fucking life.

381
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,996
I know it's incredibly
anti-feminist of me to admit it,

382
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,332
but I miss...
that sexy little bulldog.

383
00:20:58,219 --> 00:20:59,346
I fucked up.

384
00:20:59,972 --> 00:21:01,177
He fucked up!

385
00:21:01,391 --> 00:21:04,351
I just... I wanna go back
to the way things were.

386
00:21:10,801 --> 00:21:12,214
Marsupial...

387
00:21:12,572 --> 00:21:13,716
Karenina...

388
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:18,839
Did he really buy me a ring?

389
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:23,999
This comes as a shock to you?

390
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:28,361
Look, I know Hank can be a douchebag
on wheels sometimes,

391
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:30,934
but he loves the shit out of you.

392
00:21:31,771 --> 00:21:34,935
His sun rises and sets on you, baby.

393
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:43,914
Dear?

394
00:21:45,523 --> 00:21:46,381
Honey?

395
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,193
- Could I get a sip of that?
- Working hard, huh?

396
00:21:55,026 --> 00:21:57,709
Wouldn't want to get
any germs on you, huh?

397
00:21:57,977 --> 00:21:59,551
You're hardly working.

398
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:19,606
You know what?
Come on up, come on up.

399
00:22:19,933 --> 00:22:20,933
Come here.

400
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:22,327
Listen,

401
00:22:23,085 --> 00:22:26,573
I think if it hasn't happened yet,
I don't think it's gonna happen.

402
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,194
And, I apologize,
but I just think I'd be

403
00:22:29,355 --> 00:22:32,234
shooting puffs of smoke
right now, anyway, so...

404
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:33,473
Maybe...

405
00:22:33,848 --> 00:22:35,136
Maybe that's it.

406
00:22:36,531 --> 00:22:37,479
<i>No más.</i>

407
00:22:38,784 --> 00:22:40,340
You've got work to do.

408
00:22:40,572 --> 00:22:43,183
What the client wants,
the client gets.

409
00:22:43,782 --> 00:22:45,105
Not <i>this</i> client.

410
00:23:00,857 --> 00:23:04,566
- Maybe they're still out.
- The music's on, the cars are here.

411
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:06,837
They just don't hear us.

412
00:23:26,078 --> 00:23:27,169
Holy shit.

413
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:37,960
It's all clear.

414
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:47,400
Shit! Heads up!

415
00:23:48,547 --> 00:23:51,060
I just remembered
why I didn't call her back.

416
00:23:57,282 --> 00:23:58,677
Dude, she's gonna blow.

417
00:24:25,162 --> 00:24:27,970
Baby, come on. Hey.
We were taking a break!

418
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,712
I was just getting some stank
on my hang-low, like you said.

419
00:24:31,957 --> 00:24:34,364
- Don't go away mad.
- I'm not mad.

420
00:24:34,576 --> 00:24:37,006
You're just absolutely
fucking disgusting.

421
00:24:37,155 --> 00:24:39,512
I admit it wasn't the most
pleasant scene to walk in on,

422
00:24:39,677 --> 00:24:42,341
- but nobody asked you in on it.
- You're right.

423
00:24:42,502 --> 00:24:44,699
That's why I'm getting
the fuck out of here.

424
00:24:44,842 --> 00:24:46,642
You don't owe me an apology.

425
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:49,869
You can't have it both ways.
You can't tell me to fuck off,

426
00:24:50,012 --> 00:24:52,733
then wander back into my life
whenever you feel like it.

427
00:24:52,894 --> 00:24:55,748
Believe me, I will not
make the same mistake again.

428
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:58,110
Well, why did you come?

429
00:24:58,324 --> 00:25:01,335
Because you bought me a ring,
you fucking asshole.

430
00:25:01,545 --> 00:25:04,968
- I did.
- Yes. I mean, you went into a store

431
00:25:05,161 --> 00:25:08,140
and you looked around,
and then you picked out a ring...

432
00:25:08,326 --> 00:25:10,172
And then you bought it for me.

433
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:11,924
I did.

434
00:25:13,538 --> 00:25:15,676
But you never bought me a ring.
Ever.

435
00:25:15,992 --> 00:25:17,858
Why didn't you give it to me?

436
00:25:18,072 --> 00:25:21,130
You told me you were gonna marry
Bill and I should respect that.

437
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:22,597
Right. Yes.

438
00:25:23,216 --> 00:25:25,253
That never stopped you before.

439
00:25:25,704 --> 00:25:27,815
Would you have wanted me
to give it to you?

440
00:25:28,011 --> 00:25:30,140
Would that have made a difference?

441
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,141
Are you questioning things?
Are you having doubts?

442
00:25:34,826 --> 00:25:36,998
I question everything.
It's very healthy.

443
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:39,940
It <i>is</i>, but if you are questioning
things and having doubts,

444
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,693
maybe you shouldn't just
rush into the wedding.

445
00:25:42,908 --> 00:25:45,516
Maybe you should postpone it.
What's the rush?

446
00:25:45,695 --> 00:25:47,134
I can't do that.

447
00:25:47,482 --> 00:25:51,548
I never said that you had to choose
between me and William the Conqueror.

448
00:25:51,821 --> 00:25:54,371
I just think you can't
run off and marry a guy

449
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,921
after making sweet love
to yours truly.

450
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:59,962
It just wouldn't be chaste,
young lady.

451
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:03,032
Says the guy who's hosting orgies
and is standing

452
00:26:03,175 --> 00:26:05,876
- in the street in a skirt.
- It was hardly an orgy.

453
00:26:06,026 --> 00:26:08,721
I wasn't even into it.
I did it to get Charlie laid.

454
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,624
I forgot you're such
a humanitarian, right?

455
00:26:11,829 --> 00:26:14,249
I did buy you a ring,
and I would show you,

456
00:26:14,389 --> 00:26:16,984
but I gave it to a homeless
woman after you blew me off.

457
00:26:17,145 --> 00:26:19,482
True story. It was
a very nice ring. Beautiful,

458
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,640
elegant and understated,
much like you.

459
00:26:21,803 --> 00:26:25,078
I would have loved to get down on bended
knee and slip it on your finger.

460
00:26:25,311 --> 00:26:26,319
Stop it.

461
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:28,389
But buying it was a mistake.

462
00:26:28,603 --> 00:26:31,415
Because it's not about the ring.
It was <i>never</i> about the ring.

463
00:26:31,575 --> 00:26:34,069
It's not about marriage.
It's not about the wedding

464
00:26:34,212 --> 00:26:37,098
it's not about me, it's not
about Bill, it's not about Becca...

465
00:26:37,285 --> 00:26:38,858
It's about you, Karen.

466
00:26:49,811 --> 00:26:52,047
Good night, champ. Come again.

467
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:54,358
So to speak. You know...

468
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:57,981
- Good night.
- Good night,

469
00:26:58,392 --> 00:26:59,392
Karen.

470
00:27:05,819 --> 00:27:07,764
Yo. <i>Runkulus maximus.</i>

471
00:27:12,855 --> 00:27:13,979
Look at you.

472
00:27:14,811 --> 00:27:16,597
Isn't it good to be free?

473
00:27:19,761 --> 00:27:21,585
No women weighing us down.

474
00:27:24,232 --> 00:27:26,020
Ain't life fucking grand?
