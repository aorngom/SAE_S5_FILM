<i>Previously on</i> Californication...

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:04,526
Most recently I gave man birth
to a weighty tome

3
00:00:04,801 --> 00:00:07,002
called "God hates us all,"
which was turned

4
00:00:07,327 --> 00:00:10,147
into a movie called "A crazy
little thing called love."

5
00:00:10,310 --> 00:00:12,173
You started when you cheated on me.

6
00:00:12,433 --> 00:00:15,927
- Cheating isn't just about fucking.
- Are you trying to make me throw up?

7
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:18,350
Happy endings may get a bad rap,
but they happen.

8
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:21,308
It is possible one day you
and mom could get back together?

9
00:00:21,468 --> 00:00:22,610
Anything's possible.

10
00:00:23,736 --> 00:00:28,035
Get on with your life and forget about
the woman you didn't want to marry.

12
00:01:41,961 --> 00:01:43,411
Hi, sis. What's up?

13
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:53,170
<i>The white zone
is for the immediate loading</i>

14
00:01:53,377 --> 00:01:55,753
<i>and unloading of passengers only.</i>

15
00:02:05,157 --> 00:02:08,988
- Pop!
- Hey, kiddo. on time, as always.

16
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,221
Sorry, I had a late shoot last night.
How was the flight?

17
00:02:13,361 --> 00:02:15,584
Bumpy as fuck,
but the cocktails helped.

18
00:02:16,065 --> 00:02:18,339
So did business class,
thank you very much.

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,788
A guy could get used to
that kind of thing.

20
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:24,454
Not only is it a better meal,
it's a better class of stewardess.

21
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:28,278
You should have seen the one I had.
Sweet jesus, guide me.

22
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,771
I think they call them
"flight attendants" now.

23
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:35,128
She had tits out to here, legs for days,
an ass like a 10-year-old boy.

24
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:37,879
Goddamn. That's pretty.

25
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:41,447
- What kind of flower is that?
- That's a...

26
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:42,973
purple flower.

27
00:02:43,301 --> 00:02:44,951
Nobody likes a smartass.

28
00:02:45,294 --> 00:02:48,479
I don't have a fucking clue,
which never seems to stop you

29
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:50,623
from asking me
every other goddamn time.

30
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,510
Watch your mouth.

31
00:02:53,136 --> 00:02:54,974
It's kind of crazy for me lately.

32
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,297
I don't have time to stop
and smell the flowers

33
00:02:57,557 --> 00:02:59,716
and then look up
their proper names online.

34
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,645
- You find any time to get married?
- No. still living in sin.

35
00:03:04,988 --> 00:03:07,444
- Your poor mother.
- She's dead, pop.

36
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:11,978
I know. She's probably doing somersaults
in her grave right now.

37
00:03:14,882 --> 00:03:16,713
What do you think?

38
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,440
It's pretty fancy, kid.

39
00:03:18,582 --> 00:03:20,111
Sure you can afford it?

40
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:21,905
Don't sweat it. I'll be fine.

41
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,408
If you say so.

42
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:27,410
Okay, so who do I have to fuck
to get a cocktail around here?

43
00:03:32,494 --> 00:03:34,668
So, what are your thoughts on rehab?

44
00:03:35,995 --> 00:03:38,836
Rehab is for quitters.

45
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,302
Come on. Come on!

46
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:46,512
- I don't know your name.
- You haven't asked.

47
00:03:47,538 --> 00:03:49,716
Let's not stand on ceremony.

48
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,533
Trixie.

49
00:03:53,461 --> 00:03:56,166
That is a terrific name...
if you're a hooker.

50
00:04:00,494 --> 00:04:02,672
What makes you think
I'm not a hooker?

51
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:05,965
For one, you're far too beautiful.

52
00:04:06,327 --> 00:04:07,734
And secondly,

53
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,616
even if you were
a street-walking cheetah,

54
00:04:10,758 --> 00:04:12,955
I would get you
to give it to me gratis.

55
00:04:13,215 --> 00:04:16,084
- Oh, you think so?
- I have never paid for sex in my life.

56
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:17,590
I doubt that.

57
00:04:18,427 --> 00:04:20,277
Speak of the she-devil.

58
00:04:24,721 --> 00:04:28,759
We're trying to determine
if she is a professional sex worker.

59
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:32,687
How nice for you both.

60
00:04:33,282 --> 00:04:36,584
- I need you to come with me.
- And I need to use the restroom.

61
00:04:36,761 --> 00:04:39,607
You do that.
Chicks with small bladders are hot.

62
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:41,611
- Thanks.
- To be continued.

63
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:45,221
- So, your sister called.
- Well, I figured she would.

64
00:04:46,574 --> 00:04:47,673
I'm so sorry.

65
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:53,469
Well, I don't know
what to do with that exactly,

66
00:04:54,793 --> 00:04:56,370
but thank you, I guess.

67
00:04:57,326 --> 00:05:00,891
- Do you want to get out of here?
- Yeah. Where?

68
00:05:01,394 --> 00:05:03,628
- Home.
- Oh, home.

69
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:05,725
That sounds nice.

70
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:08,056
But where is that exactly, home?

71
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,887
Your home? My home? our home?

72
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,371
I got you a ticket.

73
00:05:13,651 --> 00:05:16,060
I hope it's fully refundable
'cause I ain't going.

74
00:05:16,782 --> 00:05:18,669
You're not going
to your dad's funeral?

75
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,523
He was a fucking asshole.

76
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:22,150
You don't mean that.

77
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:24,944
Don't tell me what I mean.
Don't try to mother me.

78
00:05:25,204 --> 00:05:28,394
Half the time you act like you don't
give a shit. Now you care?

79
00:05:28,553 --> 00:05:29,948
I've always cared.

80
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:31,783
It's easy to say.

81
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,749
Sir Trix-a-lot.

82
00:05:37,955 --> 00:05:40,777
- Want to get out of here?
- Sure. meter's running.

83
00:05:41,053 --> 00:05:42,211
The meter's running.

84
00:05:42,938 --> 00:05:46,506
- What should we name him?
- I know, let's call him "love."

85
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:49,762
A crazy little thing called love.

86
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:57,287
Cut! That was fucking cash!

87
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,895
- Carr, what the fuck?
- "What the fuck" what?

88
00:06:00,035 --> 00:06:03,067
I think my rectum just prolapsed.
What's with the fucking dialogue?

89
00:06:03,242 --> 00:06:06,921
They rewrote it in the trailer.
He thought we could end on the kiss.

90
00:06:07,061 --> 00:06:09,363
- What do you think?
- I think the man is money

91
00:06:09,623 --> 00:06:11,782
and we should listen
to whatever the fuck he says.

92
00:06:12,042 --> 00:06:14,451
If he wants to tuck his magical
movie-star cock

93
00:06:14,632 --> 00:06:16,942
and do the pee-pee dance,
I'd shoot it too.

94
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,554
And I would die to see it.

95
00:06:18,694 --> 00:06:21,254
But you're turning
my movie into a piece of shit.

96
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:23,293
Your book, my movie.

97
00:06:23,463 --> 00:06:25,463
Don't be a backseat director, Moody.

98
00:06:25,765 --> 00:06:28,488
All due respect, Sir,
but your boy is exhausting.

99
00:06:28,628 --> 00:06:31,406
Tell me about it.
Drove us all batshit growing up.

100
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:35,122
That was fantastic, guys.

101
00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:37,621
I hate that runty little motherfucker.

102
00:06:37,761 --> 00:06:41,503
I don't know, seemed like a nice enough
guy to me. Very charismatic.

103
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,370
I liked him in that vietnam movie.
He played a good cripple.

104
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:49,094
When in hell is overcrowded
and the devil himself walks the Earth,

105
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:51,150
don't you think
he'll be playing cripples

106
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,198
to charm a greater number of them?

107
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:55,485
- I'm proud of you, kid.
- Why?

108
00:06:55,648 --> 00:06:58,221
Why?
This is the American dream right here.

109
00:06:58,361 --> 00:07:00,454
Your name's gonna be up
on the screen.

110
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:03,245
- You'll be immortal.
- I've written a couple books, too.

111
00:07:03,426 --> 00:07:06,502
- They'll be around long after I'm gone.
- That's not the same.

112
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:09,484
- You haven't read them.
- Your mother filled me in.

113
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:12,497
- Too many words for me.
- A good writer: James Patterson.

114
00:07:12,728 --> 00:07:14,621
I read one of his books on the plane.

115
00:07:16,121 --> 00:07:18,290
Amber, hi. How are you?

116
00:07:18,579 --> 00:07:19,593
Good.

117
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,754
This is Amber. She's in the film.
Amber, this is my old man.

118
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:27,191
- So nice to meet you.
- The moodiest of the Moodys.

119
00:07:27,451 --> 00:07:29,860
I see the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

120
00:07:30,194 --> 00:07:33,329
- Come see me? I've got some thoughts.
- Okay, 2 mins?

121
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:36,888
Oh, I've got some thoughts, too...

122
00:07:37,028 --> 00:07:40,501
some thoughts that are making it
just a little bit crowded in my pants.

123
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:42,905
- What's the story, morning glory?
- Settle down.

124
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:45,784
I'm a happily non-married man.

125
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:58,087
I always wanted to do that.
Fuck, that's good. Funny.

126
00:07:58,765 --> 00:07:59,801
Good for you.

127
00:08:00,974 --> 00:08:03,631
Who says America
isn't the land of opportunity?

128
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,165
Another $10 dream come true.

129
00:08:06,448 --> 00:08:09,316
- It's gonna cost you a little more...
- Stop that!

130
00:08:09,576 --> 00:08:11,235
Maybe I should do one off your rib cage.

131
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:13,221
As you wish.

132
00:08:13,831 --> 00:08:15,454
So, what are you running from?

133
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,921
Please. No one holes up in a hotel room

134
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:22,323
with a hooker and some blow
without being on the run from something.

135
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,320
Stop joking about the hooker stuff.

136
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:26,171
You're making me paranoid.

137
00:08:27,446 --> 00:08:28,864
Maybe it's the blow.

138
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,534
- I'm not joking.
- Yes, you are.

139
00:08:35,905 --> 00:08:37,702
- No.
- Oh, come on.

140
00:08:38,086 --> 00:08:41,596
Really? Let me get this straight,
your names is... Trixie.

141
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,892
and you are in fact a whore?

142
00:08:45,152 --> 00:08:48,626
My name is Beatrice. My parents thought
it would be cute to call me "Trixie."

143
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:53,131
- They still think it's cute?
- They're dead.

144
00:08:57,014 --> 00:08:59,157
Here's a thought. Why don't...

145
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,332
I do you this time,
and then we call it even?

146
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:08,480
Do what you want, but you're still
gonna get a bill for services rendered.

147
00:09:08,759 --> 00:09:11,248
What about the blow? I paid
for the blow and you partook.

148
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,020
- Doesn't that get me a discount?
- Sorry, sweetie.

149
00:09:14,314 --> 00:09:16,414
What about the sex itself?
Was that...

150
00:09:16,637 --> 00:09:18,016
I mean, how...

151
00:09:18,945 --> 00:09:22,380
I'd be lying if I didn't say there were
moments I thought to myself,

152
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,851
whore isn't such a bad way
to earn a living.

153
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:30,422
Why don't we just call it
"casual sex between consenting adults"?

154
00:09:30,774 --> 00:09:33,408
Why don't you just pay me,
and I'll be on my way?

155
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:35,090
Because then I'd miss you.

156
00:09:35,263 --> 00:09:37,430
You can't snort a line of coke
off a woman's ass

157
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:40,220
and not wonder about her dreams.
It's not gentlemanly.

158
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:43,729
If you keep me on the clock, I tell you
what I wanted to be when I grew up.

159
00:09:57,882 --> 00:09:59,287
You take diner's club?

160
00:10:00,498 --> 00:10:02,195
I'm not kidding. I don't...

161
00:10:03,249 --> 00:10:04,837
I don't have any cash.

162
00:10:05,103 --> 00:10:06,549
You don't have any cash?

163
00:10:06,775 --> 00:10:07,916
I got the one.

164
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:13,338
How's the world's
sexiest architect doing?

165
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:14,925
Grandpa!

166
00:10:15,217 --> 00:10:18,720
Sorry my love. Your mother
happens to be a world-class beauty.

167
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:21,164
Too good for this mutt
father of yours.

168
00:10:21,343 --> 00:10:22,912
I'm remodeling a place in Venice.

169
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:24,855
And the client wants it all green.

170
00:10:25,136 --> 00:10:26,321
Painted green?

171
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:28,359
Who is he? The Jolly Green Giant?

172
00:10:29,107 --> 00:10:31,376
You have no idea
how close you are to the truth.

173
00:10:31,516 --> 00:10:34,907
You should meet this guy.
He's a total dial tone.

174
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:36,906
Just a...

175
00:10:38,526 --> 00:10:40,836
Give me a break.
You know, He's paying me very well.

176
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:43,079
Okay? I mean, he's got great taste,

177
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:45,708
and he's not an earth-hater.
What's not to like?

178
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,354
Maybe the fact that he seems
to have a huge crush on you.

179
00:10:48,533 --> 00:10:51,753
- Please. Give me a break.
- Becca agrees with me. Right, Bec?

180
00:10:52,035 --> 00:10:54,156
He does get a little goofy
around you, mom.

181
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:56,520
See? He gets goofy around you, mom.

182
00:10:56,822 --> 00:11:00,480
What about all those
actresses on your set?

183
00:11:01,314 --> 00:11:04,514
- Come on, I don't love them.
- I think I met one of those today.

184
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:08,185
You better be careful, Karen.
This one was sex on a stick.

185
00:11:08,454 --> 00:11:10,903
No, no, I didn't think
she was that attractive.

186
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:12,974
I thought she was more
of an eyesore.

187
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:14,881
Are you kidding?
The way she hugged you?

188
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,104
It almost triggered my angina.

189
00:11:17,922 --> 00:11:20,729
Well-played, pop.
Come again soon, please.

190
00:11:21,026 --> 00:11:22,437
What's an angina?

191
00:11:23,257 --> 00:11:24,726
Do I have one of those?

192
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,859
No, sweetie.

193
00:11:28,217 --> 00:11:30,512
You wanna come to the zoo
with us tomorrow, grandpa?

194
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:33,498
Would that I could, my love,
but I have to go to San Diego

195
00:11:33,789 --> 00:11:35,225
to see an old friend.

196
00:11:35,902 --> 00:11:37,411
Do you want to come with us, dad?

197
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:40,087
I'm sorry, baby.
I've got to work. I can't.

198
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:42,525
That's why you're here?

199
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:45,902
Come on, don't be
such a whiny little bitch, Hank.

200
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:48,207
Once again, my apologies, miss.

201
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:51,491
He is sometimes--
a whiny little bitch.

202
00:11:52,273 --> 00:11:55,193
- Rebecca, that's not funny.
- That's really not funny.

203
00:11:56,656 --> 00:11:58,872
That little fuzz coming
from your bottom lip.

204
00:11:59,035 --> 00:12:01,718
Are you gonna be
a trumpet player or something?

205
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,953
Yeah, I'm gonna be
a trumpet player.

206
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:13,545
- Breathe. count to ten.
- It just pisses me off!

207
00:12:13,726 --> 00:12:16,464
Becca wants to spend time
with the guy, and he's gotta go

208
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:18,626
run off and visit some old cooze

209
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,853
he was banging on the side
30 years ago.

210
00:12:21,001 --> 00:12:22,388
- What?
- Come on.

211
00:12:23,027 --> 00:12:26,490
- Why do you even care anymore?
- Because it's exactly the type of shit

212
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:29,144
that put my mother
into an early grave, that's why.

213
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:31,683
Hank, he's old man.
Give the guy a break.

214
00:12:31,964 --> 00:12:34,897
Whatever wrongs he's committed,
just put them to one side.

215
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,552
You won't change it now.

216
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:40,066
The guy probably has 3 erections left.
You should let him enjoy them.

217
00:12:40,285 --> 00:12:42,855
That fucker is the horniest man
I've ever met!

218
00:12:43,018 --> 00:12:45,655
He'll be pitching a tent
on his deathbed.

219
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:50,674
Why are you so pissed at him
for not spending time with his family?

220
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:54,541
- You never do.
- Do not turn this around on me.

221
00:12:55,076 --> 00:12:57,777
Hank, I know you're busy.
It comes with the territory.

222
00:12:57,928 --> 00:13:01,220
But I have not had a conversation
with you for like 3 months!

223
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,149
You don't give a shit anymore.

224
00:13:03,475 --> 00:13:07,100
Your head so far up your own ass,
and you don't even know it.

225
00:13:08,509 --> 00:13:10,666
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

226
00:13:16,622 --> 00:13:17,912
I think you're right.

227
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:20,257
You say that 'cause
you feel sorry for me.

228
00:13:24,427 --> 00:13:25,982
Okay, here's the plan.

229
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:30,945
As soon as I finish the movie, we jam
the car and go back to New York.

230
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:35,549
- How can you be so self-absorbed?
- What?

231
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,799
We came here for you, right?
I had nothing here.

232
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:42,087
And now that I've started
to make things work for me

233
00:13:42,286 --> 00:13:45,150
and I'm earning a living,
it just means nothing to you.

234
00:13:45,386 --> 00:13:48,616
- You redesign houses for assholes.
- How is that any different

235
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,864
- from redesigning scripts for assholes?
- It's not. that's my point.

236
00:13:52,028 --> 00:13:54,825
We gotta get out of here
before the city destroys us both.

237
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:56,891
You know, it's really not the city.

238
00:14:00,804 --> 00:14:03,405
Come on, tiny dancer.
Is that the best you got?

239
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:06,735
- Not the face, he's too cute.²- Thank...

240
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,788
Your pimp hand is strong.

241
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:15,787
Well-played, son.

242
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:18,463
That's not funny.

243
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:22,893
You okay? All right,
what are we talking about here?

244
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:25,557
Make me an offer,
I'll counter the shit out of it.

245
00:14:25,738 --> 00:14:29,080
We will handle this like the proud,
beautiful black men we are.

246
00:14:31,594 --> 00:14:34,421
- I need something for the valet.
- Both our pimps are here.

247
00:14:34,561 --> 00:14:38,021
- Mine gets 10%. What does yours get?
- 10% of what exactly?

248
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:39,588
See you later, sweetie.

249
00:14:44,109 --> 00:14:45,432
A veterinarian.

250
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:46,609
What?

251
00:14:46,908 --> 00:14:50,260
I always wanted to be
a veterinarian when I grew up.

252
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:52,258
You know, it's never too late.

253
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:54,590
Good night.

254
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,631
Okay, big boy.

255
00:15:00,327 --> 00:15:02,929
Here we go. You just cry it out.

256
00:15:03,648 --> 00:15:05,817
- It hurts.²- I know it hurts.

257
00:15:07,037 --> 00:15:08,533
You're fucking hurting me.

258
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,988
- I'm sorry.²- You're hurting my ears.

259
00:15:13,116 --> 00:15:14,327
Why are you crying?

260
00:15:14,728 --> 00:15:17,154
I'm sorry about your old man.
He was a good guy.

261
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:20,678
He wasn't. He used to say
you look like a walking penis.

262
00:15:21,116 --> 00:15:23,641
- Well, that's not very nice.²- It's not.

263
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:28,321
All right, come on.
We got to get you on a plane.

264
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:30,406
- Fuck that.²- No, fuck you.

265
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:34,103
You're going on a plane to JFK tonight.
You're gonna be with your sisters.

266
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:36,206
You deal with this shit.
You don't run from it.

267
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:38,106
Don't tell me what to feel.

268
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:41,264
All my fucking life, people have been
telling me I do things wrong.

269
00:15:41,443 --> 00:15:44,618
I'm always the fucking asshole.
I look around and I see everybody else

270
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,788
is infinitely more fucked up than I am.

271
00:15:46,928 --> 00:15:48,678
I don't know those people.

272
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:50,218
It could be the blow.

273
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,310
Married or not,

274
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:05,567
that's a hell of a family
you got there, kiddo.

275
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:07,644
I like to think so.

276
00:16:07,784 --> 00:16:10,906
- Can I give you a bit of advice?
- Do I have a choice?

277
00:16:11,382 --> 00:16:14,537
I know things are crazy
for you right now...

278
00:16:14,928 --> 00:16:16,978
I've been there, in my own way.

279
00:16:17,118 --> 00:16:20,128
Just don't go so far that you
cannot find your way back.

280
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,384
That's all I'm saying. Keep them close.

281
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:24,228
Family comes first.

282
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,249
That borders on hysterical,
coming from you and all.

283
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,900
What, I was so bad? Your mother and I
were together till the bitter end.

284
00:16:31,172 --> 00:16:32,461
Bitter, it was.

285
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:35,892
You're not gonna sit there and pretend
to be noble about this shit.

286
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:38,367
If you've got something
on your mind, out with it.

287
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,976
You were always fucking someone else.

288
00:16:41,528 --> 00:16:44,437
Your mother and I
had a lot of problems.

289
00:16:44,744 --> 00:16:46,128
We were married young,

290
00:16:46,447 --> 00:16:48,488
and we were not compatible in that way.

291
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:51,887
- You know what I mean?
- I think I do, and I'd like somebody

292
00:16:52,027 --> 00:16:55,671
to fucking smack me over the head
with a shovel right now. Anyone.

293
00:16:55,976 --> 00:16:59,621
I'm not proud of certain things I do,
but if I had to do it all over again,

294
00:16:59,881 --> 00:17:02,973
- I'm not sure I'd go at it differently.
- Why do you say that?

295
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,348
Because there's not a woman that I've
met that I haven't fallen in love with,

296
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:09,306
whether it was
for 10 minutes or 10 years.

297
00:17:09,644 --> 00:17:12,384
What would have been better?
A lifetime of denying that?

298
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:15,929
Your mother was into all that
catholic guilt shit, not me.

299
00:17:16,449 --> 00:17:19,099
Life's too short
to dance with fat chicks.

300
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,769
Let me get this straight. Here,
the lesson is keep the family together

301
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,788
and fuck around on the side if your wife
doesn't wanna blow you anymore.

302
00:17:26,928 --> 00:17:30,443
You watch it. I'm not so old
that I won't kick the shit out of you.

303
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,454
- I remember that shit, too.
- So now I beat you?

304
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,633
The problem is your generation
think raising a hand to a kid

305
00:17:36,814 --> 00:17:38,388
is the same as child abuse.

306
00:17:38,528 --> 00:17:41,955
I don't have it in front of me, but
I think it's the textbook definition.

307
00:17:42,343 --> 00:17:45,869
Always the smartass. It's your life!
Yours to screw up

308
00:17:46,085 --> 00:17:47,444
if you want to.

309
00:17:51,496 --> 00:17:54,788
I was here a year ago.
You were much happier then...

310
00:17:54,928 --> 00:17:57,057
And even happier
the year before that.

311
00:17:58,862 --> 00:18:01,943
You're not going
in the right direction.

312
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:34,987
I swear to fucking God, Karen,
I am not sleeping with anyone else.

313
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:37,260
Well, you're certainly
not sleeping with me.

314
00:18:37,895 --> 00:18:39,445
How is that my fault?

315
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,387
Every time I get remotely close to you,
you run halfway across the room.

316
00:18:43,677 --> 00:18:45,826
No, I don't. Anyway,
that didn't used to stop you.

317
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,054
You know what the weirdest thing is?

318
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:52,163
I wish you were having an affair
because then I'd stop looking for clues.

319
00:18:52,345 --> 00:18:54,378
I would never do that to you.

320
00:18:55,165 --> 00:18:56,506
You say that.

321
00:18:56,688 --> 00:18:59,377
That's just 'cause that's
your fucking romantic ideal,

322
00:18:59,517 --> 00:19:03,514
- but the truth is, you think about it.
- Yes, I think about it. who doesn't?

323
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:05,091
I never did!

324
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:06,853
Never <i>did</i>?

325
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:09,709
Past tense,
that's a little unsettling.

326
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,688
You should live with someone
who everyday reminds you

327
00:19:12,828 --> 00:19:15,221
how fucking lucky you are
to be with them!

328
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:18,758
- God damn it, that is not how I feel.
- That is how you act.

329
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:21,344
Well, fuck, Karen! It's life, then.

330
00:19:21,484 --> 00:19:24,486
I guess it's hard sometimes.
You're gonna have to deal with it.

331
00:19:24,629 --> 00:19:26,224
I am trying to deal with it!

332
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:28,598
That's why I'm talking to you
right now!

333
00:19:28,776 --> 00:19:30,563
Hank, we need to go see someone.

334
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,121
I am not going to a fucking shrink!

335
00:19:33,261 --> 00:19:35,431
I'm a writer!
I don't give that shit away.

336
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,454
- We're better than that.
- We're better than that?

337
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,133
Because it feels to me like
we're fucking dying here!

338
00:19:41,377 --> 00:19:42,641
We are not talking!

339
00:19:42,868 --> 00:19:45,787
We are not fucking!
Nothing is happening!

340
00:19:46,223 --> 00:19:47,223
And?

341
00:19:48,406 --> 00:19:51,433
And I find myself wanting
to talk to other people.

342
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:53,564
Like Bill?

343
00:19:55,216 --> 00:19:58,321
You fucking talking to Bill?
The Jolly Green Giant?

344
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:02,095
- I'm kidding, Karen.
- I don't even wanna go down that road.

345
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,481
Have you fucked him?

346
00:20:07,637 --> 00:20:09,287
It's so fucking typical.

347
00:20:09,427 --> 00:20:11,447
You go straight to the fucking.

348
00:20:11,597 --> 00:20:14,400
You don't care if I'm talking to him,
if I tell him things...

349
00:20:14,563 --> 00:20:16,365
Just answer the fucking question!

350
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:19,545
You didn't answer me.

351
00:20:21,093 --> 00:20:22,227
Yes, I did.

352
00:20:23,361 --> 00:20:24,361
You know me.

353
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:28,144
The talking and the fucking
go hand in hand.

354
00:20:34,736 --> 00:20:37,672
- I got to get the fuck out of here.
- No. You know what?

355
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:39,855
- Allow me to do that.
- Come here.

356
00:20:47,044 --> 00:20:49,992
- This isn't gonna work. It's not...
- Stop!

357
00:20:50,155 --> 00:20:51,696
Let me go!

358
00:21:01,023 --> 00:21:02,999
- Is it safe?
- I don't know, honey.

359
00:21:03,244 --> 00:21:04,435
You might wanna...

360
00:21:04,616 --> 00:21:07,516
Grab a helmet. There could be
some shrapnel flying around.

361
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:11,042
- Are you going to get a divorce?
- I think that's

362
00:21:11,586 --> 00:21:14,656
the good thing about never being
married. It's impossible to divorce.

363
00:21:15,747 --> 00:21:18,362
- You know what I mean.
- I know what you mean,

364
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:20,555
and I'm doing the best I can!

365
00:22:56,127 --> 00:22:57,777
"To my son, the writer.

366
00:22:58,982 --> 00:23:02,589
"Something I never said
too much: I love you.

367
00:23:03,769 --> 00:23:06,071
"My father never said it much, either."

368
00:23:06,277 --> 00:23:08,948
<i>And I thought I'd be different,
but I guess I'm not.</i>

369
00:23:09,377 --> 00:23:12,920
<i>I tried, but somewhere along the line,
"you slip back into what you know,</i>

370
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,810
"and I'm sorry about that.

371
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:18,682
"And I'm sorry we haven't talked
in a while because I miss you.

372
00:23:18,871 --> 00:23:21,301
"You're a good kid and a funny kid.

373
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,369
"And you're my only son.

374
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:27,402
"I said I never read your books,
but I lied.

375
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:29,015
"I read them all.

376
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,821
"I just didn't know how
to talk about them with you.

377
00:23:32,288 --> 00:23:34,699
"I didn't like the fathers in them.

378
00:23:35,076 --> 00:23:37,221
"I know you writers take liberties,

379
00:23:37,361 --> 00:23:40,718
"but I was afraid that maybe
you didn't take any at all.

380
00:23:40,881 --> 00:23:45,480
"But the thing is boys become men,
and men become husbands and fathers,

381
00:23:45,689 --> 00:23:48,027
"and we do the best we can.

382
00:23:49,146 --> 00:23:51,368
"You're doing the best you can.

383
00:23:51,606 --> 00:23:53,011
"You've done good.

384
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:56,187
"Your books will be in libraries
long after we're both gone,

385
00:23:56,327 --> 00:23:57,851
"and this is important.

386
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:01,275
"More important
is how you treat your family.

387
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:05,145
"I wasn't a perfect husband,
but I loved your mother,

388
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:08,110
"and I'm glad
we spent our lives together.

389
00:24:08,388 --> 00:24:10,028
"And I'm here if you need me.

390
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,919
"That's all I wanted to say.

391
00:24:13,377 --> 00:24:15,596
"Love, your old man."

392
00:24:18,017 --> 00:24:22,240
"P.S.: I saw a preview
of your movie the other night.

393
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:25,203
"It looks like a piece of shit,"

394
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:27,609
"maybe you were right."

395
00:26:07,122 --> 00:26:09,588
<i>The white zone
is for the immediate loading</i>

396
00:26:09,728 --> 00:26:11,878
<i>and unloading of passengers only.</i>

397
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:18,387
So, we'll be right behind you.

398
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:22,968
The moment Becca gets out of school,
we'll get a flight.

399
00:26:38,807 --> 00:26:40,248
I love you.

400
00:26:43,141 --> 00:26:43,965
I...

401
00:26:44,447 --> 00:26:46,713
I didn't say it to hear it back.

402
00:26:55,265 --> 00:26:56,933
Thanks for helping me...

403
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,077
Get my head out of my ass.

404
00:27:01,436 --> 00:27:03,067
It's what I do.

405
00:27:23,732 --> 00:27:27,664
- You know what this is called.
- Yeah, it's Jacaranda tree.
