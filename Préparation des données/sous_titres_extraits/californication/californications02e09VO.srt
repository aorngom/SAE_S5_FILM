1
00:00:00,533 --> 00:00:04,379
This is rehab, okay? I got to tell you
all the bad shit I did.

2
00:00:04,547 --> 00:00:07,178
So, what?
You hocked everything.

3
00:00:07,303 --> 00:00:09,388
Is that it?
The Cartier love bracelet,

4
00:00:09,513 --> 00:00:12,380
the Venetian glass we got
on our honeymoon...

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,015
I didn't sell that ceramic bowl
that they gave us as a wedding present.

6
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:18,726
- Well.
- I made that for you.

7
00:00:19,065 --> 00:00:21,729
I know.
It's special as shit to me.

8
00:00:23,127 --> 00:00:24,753
That's for you, by the way.

9
00:00:24,878 --> 00:00:27,068
- I made it in art therapy.
- Really?

10
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,529
- You're welcome.
- Thank you. I will...

11
00:00:30,813 --> 00:00:33,128
- treasure it always.
- Jesus Christ! Marce!

12
00:00:33,253 --> 00:00:34,908
Is there more?
Is that it? What?

13
00:00:36,252 --> 00:00:39,414
Just the thing with the waiter
at the airport chili's.

14
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:41,692
- Marcy!
- I need to fess up, okay?

15
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,001
It's part of the process.

16
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:46,940
There was just
a little bit of tongue.

17
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:49,799
I was gonna get on the plane
to see my mother... I swear.

18
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:54,015
But the guy had some blow.
One thing lead to another...

19
00:00:54,566 --> 00:00:57,097
- we made out a little.
- Enough. Just stop, okay?

20
00:00:57,962 --> 00:01:01,502
If I were doing anything like that,
you wouldn't want to hear about it?

21
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:04,020
You absolutely would not wanna know
something like that.

22
00:01:04,646 --> 00:01:08,276
I wouldn't say absolutely.
And you were doing something like that.

23
00:01:08,444 --> 00:01:10,153
Remember?
With Dani?

24
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:13,311
You went off the deep end,
and what did I do, Runkle?

25
00:01:13,436 --> 00:01:16,076
I stood by you.
I forgave your ass.

26
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:19,453
And that's what he's doing.
I mean, he's here. He's standing by you.

27
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,890
You know,
this is gonna be rough, honey.

28
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:24,708
You're just in the first week.

29
00:01:24,877 --> 00:01:27,189
But you guys,
you're gonna get through this.

30
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:30,255
Yeah, you're gonna be stronger
in the places that are broken.

31
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:33,224
Like Hemingway said.

32
00:01:33,815 --> 00:01:36,063
I don't know
what I'd do without you guys.

33
00:01:36,188 --> 00:01:39,139
Well, fortunately,
you will never have to find out.

34
00:01:42,312 --> 00:01:44,752
- We should go, give them some space.
- Okay.

35
00:01:44,877 --> 00:01:46,327
<i>Adieu</i>, Cokie Smurf.

36
00:01:47,187 --> 00:01:49,775
You look much better
without that giant monkey on your back.

37
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,316
- Not good enough.
- You want tongue?

38
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:56,194
I want everybody in.
Come on, you two.

39
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:59,285
- Literally? Like a group hug?
- Yes. Please?

40
00:02:01,214 --> 00:02:02,205
All right.

41
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:08,151
That's right.
Feel the love.

42
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:10,502
- I'm feeling the love.
- The love is strong.

43
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:13,256
I'm feeling something poking me
on my left, is what I'm feeling.

44
00:02:13,553 --> 00:02:14,969
I got a bro-ner.

45
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,219
Subtitle:
www.sub-way.fr (1.00)

46
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:00,537
Watch and learn.

47
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,854
Are you, swinging on the exhale
or the inhale?

48
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:08,103
You hooked it.

49
00:03:08,949 --> 00:03:10,011
Gator ball.

50
00:03:10,212 --> 00:03:11,252
A little hook.

51
00:03:11,377 --> 00:03:15,068
If I hit one ball way the fuck over
into Houdini's front yard,

52
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:16,945
then you have to tell me, right?

53
00:03:17,115 --> 00:03:19,021
Everything Janie said about you?

54
00:03:19,146 --> 00:03:21,199
No way. I don't interview and tell.

55
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,721
Hook!

56
00:03:23,935 --> 00:03:26,189
- Captain Hook.
- Come on, Moody.

57
00:03:27,145 --> 00:03:29,834
- It's my fucking life.
- Not anymore it's not. It's my book.

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,582
Besides, I'm not wagering on this game.
You invented it.

59
00:03:32,707 --> 00:03:35,047
You made up all the bullshit rules.

60
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:38,885
Run, you cunt!
That was all right. It came back.

61
00:03:39,395 --> 00:03:41,644
Kind of a metaphor for life,
isn't it, lad?

62
00:03:41,769 --> 00:03:43,957
Yeah, it's Ashby's world.
We all just live in it.

63
00:03:44,082 --> 00:03:46,455
Come on. I've been good lately.
I haven't seen Mia once.

64
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:49,060
She's been busy doing publicity

65
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,855
for this book she wrote.
What is that? A memoir or something?

66
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:53,064
Or something.

67
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:57,268
Come on, give me a little something
for good behavior!

68
00:03:57,393 --> 00:04:01,247
All right! I can't tell you how I know
this, but the Beverly Hills husband...

69
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,193
definitely cheating.

70
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:04,452
No shit.

71
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,959
No shit. I'll know more
when I see her tonight.

72
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:10,290
You're gonna see her tonight?
Your labia got in the way of that one.

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,460
It's...

74
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,557
- Friday night.
- Yeah.

75
00:04:13,682 --> 00:04:16,979
You can't see her tonight.
That's weird. It's like a...

76
00:04:17,348 --> 00:04:18,268
date.

77
00:04:18,393 --> 00:04:21,332
Two people of the opposite gender
can't rendezvous after 7:00 p.m.?

78
00:04:21,457 --> 00:04:23,762
- It's automatically a date?
- In Ashby's world.

79
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:27,258
I like that.

80
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,657
No, Marcy's still out of town,
but I could squeeze you in with Oxsana

81
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:36,420
Tuesday at 4:00.

82
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:41,525
Okay. Great.
We'll see you then. Bye.

83
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:45,618
- How's the patient?
- Requiring all my patience.

84
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:49,246
Daisy, I can't thank you enough
for filling in like this.

85
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:51,521
No problem.
It's fun.

86
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:52,709
Fun?

87
00:04:53,144 --> 00:04:56,461
Rescheduling all Marcy's appointments,
dealing with angry clients...

88
00:04:57,643 --> 00:05:00,958
It's a lot easier than getting cum shot
in your eye and pretending to like it.

89
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,960
And all week long
I've kind of felt special,

90
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,770
like one of those girls in the movies
who works in an office.

91
00:05:07,895 --> 00:05:10,266
Like <i>The Devil Wears Prada</i>
or something.

92
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:13,512
Yeah, well, those girls
all generally get paid.

93
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:16,080
I am not helping out around here
to get paid.

94
00:05:16,205 --> 00:05:18,734
You guys took me in.
You made me a part of your family.

95
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:21,027
I don't know if "family"
is the right word.

96
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:23,165
You mean 'cause of our lengthy...

97
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:24,889
Don't worry.

98
00:05:25,206 --> 00:05:28,201
I get it.
I know it's never gonna happen again.

99
00:05:29,268 --> 00:05:30,746
- You do?
- Yeah!

100
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:33,540
Don't sweat it. I'm already looking
for a new place to live.

101
00:05:35,518 --> 00:05:37,919
You know, the guest room
is yours until you...

102
00:05:39,206 --> 00:05:41,965
Excuse me.
Glamorous and important work to do.

103
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:50,114
You Karen?

104
00:05:51,252 --> 00:05:53,310
- Who's asking?
- I work for Lew Ashby.

105
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,635
You're a long way
from Laurel Canyon.

106
00:05:56,913 --> 00:05:57,928
Here.

107
00:05:58,384 --> 00:05:59,924
What? What is that?

108
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:07,450
- It just says "Get in the car."
- He's not one for words.

109
00:06:07,856 --> 00:06:11,037
- We'll have you back by 11:00.
- Back from where? What the...

110
00:06:11,205 --> 00:06:14,456
I can't say exactly.
But I can say it's supremely awesome.

111
00:06:14,972 --> 00:06:17,543
You honestly expect me
to get in that car with you?

112
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:20,381
What? You got something else to do?
It's Friday night.

113
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,008
Come on.

114
00:06:27,072 --> 00:06:30,306
You sure about this? We could always
grab a box of their best Chardonnay

115
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:31,936
and drink it at the bus stop.

116
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:34,661
You promised you would take me
anywhere I wanted to go tonight.

117
00:06:34,786 --> 00:06:35,997
I did, and I meant it.

118
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:38,692
But I was thinking more like
burgers at the Apple Pan.

119
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,196
So you're a cheap date.

120
00:06:41,696 --> 00:06:45,124
Just because two people of the opposite
gender rendezvous after 7:00 p.m.

121
00:06:45,249 --> 00:06:47,396
doesn't necessarily make it a date.

122
00:06:47,695 --> 00:06:49,970
I think Lew would disagree
with you on that.

123
00:06:50,095 --> 00:06:52,771
- He has. Yeah.
- So he knows we're out tonight?

124
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:55,946
She asked because
she obviously still gives a damn.

125
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:57,768
What about you, your husband?

126
00:06:57,893 --> 00:07:00,830
Where does the one that you gave
your troth to think you are tonight?

127
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,947
He took the kids to Legoland
for the weekend.

128
00:07:03,072 --> 00:07:04,612
- Legoland!
- Legoland.

129
00:07:05,999 --> 00:07:09,136
Plus, he feels Venice is too dangerous.
He doesn't like to come here.

130
00:07:09,798 --> 00:07:11,821
Well, in your case, he may be right.

131
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:15,178
Look at this monstrosity.

132
00:07:15,767 --> 00:07:17,524
- I like this one.
- You do?

133
00:07:17,649 --> 00:07:19,329
Yeah, it looks how I feel.

134
00:07:19,945 --> 00:07:21,551
What's that... Alienated?

135
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:24,972
Nauseous?
Culturally dispossessed?

136
00:07:25,214 --> 00:07:27,070
No, horny.

137
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,074
Cheese cube.

138
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,287
- Hank, are you okay? Is he okay?
- It just went down the wrong pipe.

139
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,052
Cheese cube.

140
00:07:43,143 --> 00:07:44,984
- Hi. I'm Janie.
- Hi. Sonja.

141
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:47,340
Sonja.
When are you due?

142
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,842
God! Six more weeks.

143
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:51,427
- You look great.
- Thank you so much.

144
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,889
So how do you two know each other?

145
00:07:56,378 --> 00:07:58,561
Look who's here.
Look at that.

146
00:08:01,185 --> 00:08:03,816
Sonja and we have no secrets.

147
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:07,153
- Yeah, Hank is the father.
- Alleged father...

148
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:08,935
of Sonja's bump.

149
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,200
It's nice that you're here.
I never thought you'd be, you know,

150
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:16,619
at a place like this. I didn't.
It's Julian's gallery.

151
00:08:16,893 --> 00:08:18,504
No, I did not know that.

152
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:22,073
Okay, and now that you do, you're never
gonna get down here again, will you?

153
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:23,878
Probably not.

154
00:08:24,047 --> 00:08:27,715
- Slippery... Slippery guy, this one.
- Very slippery. Who's Julian?

155
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:30,801
Julian self, the... <i>Artist Within</i>.

156
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:33,293
There he is.
Salvador Dalí.

157
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:37,057
My God! Look at that.

158
00:08:37,555 --> 00:08:39,574
You know what?
I knew it. Look how late it is.

159
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:43,522
We're... Hopping
from gallery to gallery tonight.

160
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,775
"Gallery-hopping" I think they call it.
And we've got another thing to get to.

161
00:08:46,944 --> 00:08:49,109
- I don't thinkwe have another thing.
- No, we do.

162
00:08:49,234 --> 00:08:50,932
No, you can't go.
You cannot...

163
00:08:51,057 --> 00:08:53,406
You cannot leave
without saying hello to Julian.

164
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:55,539
No, I think we can. We could.

165
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,773
You promised
we'd do anything I wanted.

166
00:08:57,898 --> 00:09:00,331
- I did? That doesn't sound like me.
- Lead the way, Sonja.

167
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:04,990
You don't know me well enough
to torture me in this fashion.

168
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:14,435
Shit, Marcy!

169
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,807
All the petty cash, too?

170
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:21,894
Hey, I'm sorry... Listen.

171
00:09:23,689 --> 00:09:26,815
Look, I know it probably took
a lot of courage just to walk in here,

172
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:30,944
but actually we're closed. In fact,
we don't really even, you know, do men.

173
00:09:31,114 --> 00:09:33,157
- Is Daisy here?
- Daisy?

174
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,865
No, listen, pal.

175
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:38,576
No <i>màs</i> appointments today. I just...
I forgot to lock the door is all.

176
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,328
We're going out.

177
00:09:40,932 --> 00:09:42,696
- On a date?
- Yeah.

178
00:09:47,492 --> 00:09:48,833
You look amazing.

179
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:50,798
You do! You look...

180
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,230
I was just meetingyour friend.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.

181
00:09:56,371 --> 00:09:59,389
Steve, this is my boss,
Charlie Runkle.

182
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,592
- Nice to meet you, Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

183
00:10:01,717 --> 00:10:04,560
So... have you got a job, Steve?

184
00:10:05,423 --> 00:10:08,239
- Some means of support?
- Yeah, of course.

185
00:10:08,747 --> 00:10:11,234
I work across the street
at the Sharper Image.

186
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,902
Sharper image.

187
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:16,614
You know, if you're not done with work,
I can wait for you outside if you like.

188
00:10:16,784 --> 00:10:18,867
- That would be great.
- Okay.

189
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,165
- Seems nice.
- Don't you mean "boring as shit"?

190
00:10:26,845 --> 00:10:29,002
Thanks for covering for me,
by the way.

191
00:10:29,865 --> 00:10:33,340
We both know I'm not really the girl

192
00:10:33,509 --> 00:10:35,043
who works at the front desk.

193
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,716
Sure you are.
You're any girl you want to be.

194
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,191
You know, I don't have to go out
with this guy.

195
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:44,225
He asked, and I figured, "What the hell?
Do something normal for a change."

196
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:46,614
But I could tell him something
came up with work...

197
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:49,105
and stay...
Help you with the books.

198
00:10:49,275 --> 00:10:51,530
Yeah, because that wouldn't beat
all dysfunctional.

199
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:53,234
No, no, you should go.

200
00:10:53,404 --> 00:10:56,602
You know, you should go out
tonight on a normal date

201
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,949
with a normal guy
because you're young

202
00:11:00,681 --> 00:11:01,784
and normal.

203
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,621
And that's what normal people
normally do.

204
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:09,131
Don't work too hard.

205
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,333
Don't you fuck him too hard.

206
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:54,673
Just in time.

207
00:11:55,341 --> 00:11:59,019
I had no idea they...
they started so promptly, I mean...

208
00:11:59,814 --> 00:12:02,870
"Lili Haydn,
the Hollywood Bowl, 8:30."

209
00:12:04,006 --> 00:12:06,354
I take it you don't like the crowds.

210
00:12:06,736 --> 00:12:08,386
I have issues.

211
00:12:09,344 --> 00:12:10,344
You do?

212
00:12:20,235 --> 00:12:21,235
So...

213
00:12:22,048 --> 00:12:24,325
- You think you might stay?
- I might.

214
00:12:24,495 --> 00:12:26,540
I mean, it's a beautiful evening,
right?

215
00:12:28,359 --> 00:12:29,664
Where are we gonna sit?

216
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:32,708
Maybe we can squeeze up front.
I know people.

217
00:12:50,107 --> 00:12:53,097
So do you use flavored wax for this

218
00:12:53,222 --> 00:12:55,216
or just, like, surfboard wax?

219
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,420
Do you know
what hospital you're going to...

220
00:12:57,545 --> 00:13:00,194
God, you know what?
No hospitals.

221
00:13:00,606 --> 00:13:02,618
We're having home water birth.

222
00:13:02,743 --> 00:13:04,803
Eases the birth trauma and...

223
00:13:06,973 --> 00:13:08,577
much more sensual for a woman.

224
00:13:08,702 --> 00:13:10,823
It facilitates the birth orgasm.

225
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:14,499
So in a pool this is gonna happen?

226
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:17,795
So you're not expecting
so much a boy or girl as a sea-monkey.

227
00:13:19,441 --> 00:13:21,591
- Amphibious.
- It's actually...

228
00:13:22,117 --> 00:13:23,197
It's a boy.

229
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,134
We have a home ultrasound machine.

230
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,513
We do it every week.
Did I forget to tell you about that?

231
00:13:27,683 --> 00:13:29,471
About the home ultrasound machine?
Yes.

232
00:13:29,596 --> 00:13:32,356
But of course I assumed you had one.
Doesn't everybody?

233
00:13:33,189 --> 00:13:36,584
Hank hasn't always been so involved
in all this pregnancy stuff.

234
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:38,983
And that is a choice
that Hank will live to regret.

235
00:13:39,468 --> 00:13:42,153
Have you...
experienced giving birth?

236
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:44,477
Yes, I have.

237
00:13:45,076 --> 00:13:47,450
But you haven't experienced
a birth orgasm, have you?

238
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,940
- No, I did not.
- You know, I think...

239
00:13:50,065 --> 00:13:52,747
maybe you should let Julian
do a reading for you.

240
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:55,541
- He can gauge your negativity.
- No, I'm good.

241
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:57,875
- I think he's gauging it right now.
- We're good.

242
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,379
We have to get going.
We have that next thing.

243
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:03,508
What thing? You don't want to stay
and hear more about the birth orgasm?

244
00:14:04,566 --> 00:14:05,910
- Jane.
- What?

245
00:14:06,216 --> 00:14:08,208
- You have very beautiful eyes.
- I do?

246
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:09,263
Yes, and...

247
00:14:09,433 --> 00:14:12,258
whatever pain you have experienced
in this life,

248
00:14:12,383 --> 00:14:14,044
you've obviously transcended.

249
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,853
Are you menstruating right now?

250
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:18,856
- Am I... Menstruating?
- And we're done.

251
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:21,234
- That was a good time.
- Hank, come on.

252
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:23,152
Don't go. We're having fun.

253
00:14:23,322 --> 00:14:26,137
- He didn't mean it. It wasn't sexual.
- Of course it's sexual.

254
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:28,282
There's nothing wrong
with expressing

255
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,493
a healthy, respectful interest

256
00:14:30,663 --> 00:14:32,328
in someone else's sexuality.

257
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,938
- See, I'm married, so...
- Now you're married.

258
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:36,172
I am. I'm married.

259
00:14:36,297 --> 00:14:39,210
I think he's suggesting group sex.
That's what you're suggesting, right?

260
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,798
By all means.
I mean, look at us.

261
00:14:42,341 --> 00:14:46,008
The four of us have
this incredible pansexual chemistry.

262
00:14:46,178 --> 00:14:48,026
You go.
I'm gonna take a bullet for you.

263
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:50,052
- Come here.
- Don't resist.

264
00:14:51,225 --> 00:14:54,161
You know what? I just want it so bad,
I'm just not ready.

265
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,279
- I'm not ready.
- I'll see you soon, okay?

266
00:14:58,318 --> 00:14:59,939
What the fuck was that?

267
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:01,214
I like him.

268
00:15:13,107 --> 00:15:16,168
- Daisy, you're back.
- Yeah, I was just in the neighborhood.

269
00:15:16,293 --> 00:15:18,458
I don't understand.
Is your date over already?

270
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,726
Not exactly.

271
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:21,608
I kind of blew it off.

272
00:15:22,741 --> 00:15:24,881
I know! I know!

273
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:26,716
Highly dysfunctional.

274
00:15:26,912 --> 00:15:28,919
But, you see, I forgot something.

275
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:33,181
- What's that?
- Just how much I love <i>Dirty Dancing</i>.

276
00:15:33,611 --> 00:15:35,434
Friends don't let friends wallow.

277
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,099
At least not alone.

278
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,733
So what do you say, Charlie Runkle?

279
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:42,441
Are you ready to have
the time of your life?

280
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:54,421
It is not every day that you meet
a man who has impregnated a cult member.

281
00:15:54,546 --> 00:15:56,732
There were a lot
of controlled substances involved.

282
00:15:56,857 --> 00:15:58,669
It was only the one time, so...

283
00:15:58,794 --> 00:16:01,233
- So your boys are potent?
- They were...

284
00:16:01,358 --> 00:16:05,347
I've been snipped,
vasectomized, had my testes done.

285
00:16:05,472 --> 00:16:07,357
That is some excellent foreplay.

286
00:16:07,482 --> 00:16:09,170
You like that?
That's my "A" material.

287
00:16:09,295 --> 00:16:11,982
At the end of the night, I just come
right out and announce my infertility.

288
00:16:12,107 --> 00:16:12,980
It's sexy.

289
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,097
- Yeah, it's working for you, huh?
- It is. It really turns a girl on.

290
00:16:16,222 --> 00:16:17,375
That reminds me.

291
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:19,394
I've got something of yours.

292
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,942
You... left something at my place.
Your notebook.

293
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,669
I hope you filled in
all the blanks for me.

294
00:16:29,016 --> 00:16:32,468
I figured you could do that,
maybe follow me back to my place?

295
00:16:33,474 --> 00:16:34,826
For the proverbial nightcap?

296
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:40,796
I'm gonna have to pass
on that very tempting offer.

297
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,127
- Rejected.
- No, don't think of it that way.

298
00:16:44,296 --> 00:16:47,214
Think of it...
I'm gay.

299
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,046
- You're gay?
- I'm a big fat gay.

300
00:16:50,756 --> 00:16:52,127
Why?
Because I'm married?

301
00:16:52,252 --> 00:16:55,154
Because you're married
and because you're Lew's girl and...

302
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,923
'cause I'm getting
the strangest feeling about you.

303
00:16:58,048 --> 00:16:58,901
You are?

304
00:16:59,026 --> 00:17:01,687
Yeah, I mean, I can't believe
I'm gonna say this out loud,

305
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:05,691
but I feel that I don't want
to make love to you just the once,

306
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:09,610
although I'm sure you would enjoy
the shit out of it.

307
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:11,947
I don't think you're gonna get
this chance again.

308
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:20,955
Mean.

309
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:24,358
You're...

310
00:17:25,513 --> 00:17:27,705
mean, mean, mean, mean.

311
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:29,240
You're just mean.

312
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:32,175
Still, I'm gonna have to say no.

313
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:35,797
So I'm just,
like, what, a story for your book?

314
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,486
You're not gonna bait me
into changing my mind, Janie Jones.

315
00:17:41,253 --> 00:17:42,419
But wait.

316
00:17:42,544 --> 00:17:46,357
Answer me this, though. What is so sexy
about a man who's been vasectomized?

317
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,101
I don't know.
I guess...

318
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,810
it shows that you can commit,

319
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:53,591
that you can give
your whole heart to someone,

320
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,166
make sacrifices to please a woman.

321
00:17:56,367 --> 00:17:59,369
So you think a woman made me do this,
some castrating female?

322
00:17:59,537 --> 00:18:03,044
Definitely did this for a woman.
You are not some stray dog, Hank Moody.

323
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,791
You belong to someone.

324
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,711
Takes one to know one.

325
00:18:10,732 --> 00:18:13,670
You know, he throws these huge
parties and these people come

326
00:18:13,795 --> 00:18:16,418
and they drink his booze,
and they act like they're his friends.

327
00:18:16,596 --> 00:18:17,679
Yeah, I've heard.

328
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:20,098
Guest of honor never shows.

329
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:41,356
I'm not sure I can bear
to watch the rest of this.

330
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,819
It's pretty much over
once Baby comes out of the corner.

331
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,717
Were you even alive
in the fall of 1987?

332
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:55,550
Of course I was alive.

333
00:18:56,863 --> 00:18:58,322
It was a good time.

334
00:18:58,803 --> 00:19:02,015
I was in the mail room at William
Morris. Marce was still at NYU.

335
00:19:02,358 --> 00:19:04,760
One day, somebody broke
in to her dorm room.

336
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:06,853
Some homeless crack addict

337
00:19:07,026 --> 00:19:09,147
snuck in and stole all her jewelry,

338
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,232
so I tried to think of a movie
to cheer her up.

339
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:12,531
It worked?

340
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:15,044
We had to all the way
up to 57th street to see it...

341
00:19:15,169 --> 00:19:17,864
some crappy little theater
that's not even there anymore.

342
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:19,855
The Duane Reade across the street...

343
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:23,245
where I went in to buy her Twizzlers
and a diet coke... That's still there.

344
00:19:25,982 --> 00:19:27,870
Charlie, she'll get better.

345
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:30,836
She'll be home soon
and everything will get back to normal.

346
00:19:31,346 --> 00:19:32,526
Yeah, sure.

347
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:34,732
She'll quit the Bolivian
marching powder

348
00:19:34,857 --> 00:19:37,971
I'll put my libido back
in a box and re-don the suit.

349
00:19:38,096 --> 00:19:41,231
- The whole cycle can start over again.
- I don't know much about marriage,

350
00:19:41,356 --> 00:19:44,201
but it doesn't sound
so entirely bad to me.

351
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,938
You're probably right.

352
00:19:50,437 --> 00:19:53,341
What's your choice, right?
You choose your partner,

353
00:19:53,466 --> 00:19:55,526
then you do the dance.
What's the alternative?

354
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,668
- Sit the whole thing out?
- No way.

355
00:19:57,793 --> 00:19:59,701
You can't do that, right?

356
00:20:00,209 --> 00:20:01,992
And at the very least, I mean...

357
00:20:03,705 --> 00:20:06,663
you gotta dance
the last dance of the season.

358
00:20:07,857 --> 00:20:09,665
I'm not sure
that's a very good idea.

359
00:20:09,835 --> 00:20:12,210
What? I'm not talking
anything carnal...

360
00:20:12,418 --> 00:20:14,231
Just a simple box step.

361
00:20:14,423 --> 00:20:18,403
I stay in my dance space,
you stay in your dance space.

362
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:22,095
Well... maybe that can work.

363
00:20:24,544 --> 00:20:27,365
- Except I'm not very good.
- Me neither.

364
00:20:52,786 --> 00:20:53,983
Here you are.

365
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:55,829
Right where you started.

366
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:59,359
- None the worse for wear, huh?
- You're right. Thank you.

367
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:02,912
Really, that was such a great night.

368
00:21:03,975 --> 00:21:05,488
And I appreciate it.

369
00:21:05,613 --> 00:21:08,891
Well, it's not just the music, right?
It's how and...

370
00:21:09,715 --> 00:21:11,105
When you hear it.

371
00:21:11,230 --> 00:21:12,251
That's it.

372
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:14,889
Okay. Don't forget your work uff.

373
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:18,204
I don't get to say that a lot.

374
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,703
Girls that work
at Jumbo's Clown room

375
00:21:21,828 --> 00:21:24,266
don't usually have briefcases
and shit.

376
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:28,387
Yeah, I can imagine there wouldn't be
a whole lot of use for that, right?

377
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:33,105
- So, Lew, it's been real.
- Yikes. We're gonna shake hands?

378
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:34,290
Yes, we are.

379
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:36,829
It's my date, my rules, right?

380
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:40,840
So it was a date?

381
00:21:42,604 --> 00:21:45,929
Anytime two people meet after 7:00 pm,
it's a date, right?

382
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,274
My thoughts exactly.
What's wrong with people?

383
00:21:48,399 --> 00:21:50,596
Nobody has the balls to actually say
they're on a date.

384
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:52,852
- Sorry. I can't let go of your hand.
- I know.

385
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:56,022
You kind of, sort of remind me
of someone I once knew.

386
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,322
Okay, I do?

387
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:59,776
I know. You should take her
to the Hollywood Bowl.

388
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,784
- 'Cause that was such a great date.
- Maybe I will. I mean, I used to

389
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:06,074
all the time.
We'd sit in the cheap seats.

390
00:22:06,242 --> 00:22:08,534
You know,
if I ever had another chance...

391
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:11,285
Right. If you ever had another chance,
you'd do it different.

392
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,249
Everybody says that and it's bullshit
cause you do it just the same.

393
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:16,788
No, not me, I swear.
I learn from my mistakes.

394
00:22:16,913 --> 00:22:17,913
You do?

395
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,503
Totally.

396
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:23,468
My God! You're insane!

397
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:25,010
I'm sorry. I lied.

398
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:28,471
Life's just too fucking boring
not to try, okay?

399
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:30,640
Right. That is true.
I will give you that.

400
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:33,226
Lew, seriously,
that was an amazing night.

401
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:35,103
And let's not ruin it.

402
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,396
I really appreciate it.
I had a great time.

403
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:42,308
I guess I'll take that
if it's all I can get.

404
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:44,483
My God! You're not still trying!

405
00:22:44,999 --> 00:22:46,239
Sorry. Truce.

406
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:49,367
Yeah, truce. Good, good.
Let's leave on a peaceful note.

407
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:01,519
My God.

408
00:23:13,085 --> 00:23:14,667
What are you doing, woman?

409
00:23:14,792 --> 00:23:17,518
Look at you. You don't have
your keys out. You got all those bags.

410
00:23:17,643 --> 00:23:21,642
You're like one of those victims
in a self-defense instructional video.

411
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,455
- What are you doing?
- Any deviant could jump out at you

412
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:27,226
at this point and...
Then a stranger could be waiting.

413
00:23:27,351 --> 00:23:30,533
- There is a strange guy waiting for me.
- Who? Me?

414
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,035
- Yeah!
- What?

415
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,786
Are you stalking me?

416
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,193
Stalking you?

417
00:23:35,318 --> 00:23:37,976
No, if I was stalking you,
I wouldn't have to ask you

418
00:23:38,101 --> 00:23:39,788
where you've been tonight.

419
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:41,503
Are you asking me that?

420
00:23:42,124 --> 00:23:45,287
- You don't have to tell me.
- Good. 'Cause I won't.

421
00:23:45,412 --> 00:23:49,037
Don't you wanna know where I've been?
Because I have been somewhere tonight.

422
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,684
- No, not especially.
- No, I want to tell you.

423
00:23:51,809 --> 00:23:53,786
Let me just tell you
what I did not do, OK?

424
00:23:53,911 --> 00:23:56,315
I went on a date with this beautiful
and amazing woman,

425
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,104
No, no, no!
And I did not have sex with her.

426
00:23:59,829 --> 00:24:00,647
Not?

427
00:24:00,815 --> 00:24:03,415
I just cock-blocked myself.
I remained chaste.

428
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,723
I kept my eye on the big picture.

429
00:24:05,848 --> 00:24:08,029
I exercised some impulse control.

430
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:10,288
Till the moment that you had
to get in your car

431
00:24:10,413 --> 00:24:14,125
- and drive here and tell me about it?
- Yeah, that impulse I did not control.

432
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:17,300
- No, I wanted to share that with you.
- Thank you.

433
00:24:18,345 --> 00:24:20,136
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

434
00:24:22,610 --> 00:24:25,380
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- How am I looking at you?

435
00:24:25,711 --> 00:24:28,424
Like you want a reward or something.

436
00:24:28,897 --> 00:24:30,093
You have something?

437
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,534
- I have a little biscuit.
- You have a biscuit?

438
00:24:32,659 --> 00:24:34,309
A little cookie for you.

439
00:24:46,303 --> 00:24:48,028
That was very rewarding.

440
00:24:49,564 --> 00:24:51,791
I just had to check to see,
you know,

441
00:24:51,916 --> 00:24:54,802
if I could still break through
that impulse control of yours.

442
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,421
Apparently, you can.

443
00:24:56,788 --> 00:24:57,788
Thank God.

444
00:25:02,237 --> 00:25:05,008
Hey, is Becca really
at a friend's house tonight?

445
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,683
She's not with Damien?

446
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,353
- Come on.
- Are you fucking insane?

447
00:25:10,478 --> 00:25:12,181
No, but you obviously are.

448
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:17,236
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Okay, what do you want to talk about?

449
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:23,931
I want to know about your date.

450
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:27,108
Did you really just
shut that poor woman down?

451
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:28,804
Just shut her down,

452
00:25:29,226 --> 00:25:32,304
Just... I was the boss.
I did kiss her, but I didn't go inside.

453
00:25:32,429 --> 00:25:33,841
- Gross.
- I'm just saying.

454
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:35,729
- Gross.
- But I refrained.

455
00:25:35,854 --> 00:25:39,662
- You refrained from tapping that ass?
- I refrained from tapping that ass.

456
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:41,376
Was that a first?

457
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:46,200
We still don't know why
you were so late

458
00:25:46,325 --> 00:25:47,921
returning to home tonight.

459
00:25:48,592 --> 00:25:51,007
- Big night at the book club, was it?
- Yes.

460
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:53,302
Did you O.D. on estrogen
and have to...

461
00:25:53,427 --> 00:25:55,802
- come home for a little...
- I was actually on a date.

462
00:25:56,284 --> 00:25:57,138
Jesus.

463
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:01,184
- That's gross.
- And it was quite fun.

464
00:26:01,568 --> 00:26:03,856
Now you're disgusting.
I don't wanna hear that shit.

465
00:26:03,981 --> 00:26:05,980
Yes, you do.
You're gonna hear about it

466
00:26:06,105 --> 00:26:08,191
unless you can stop me.

467
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:10,777
Can you stop me?

468
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:18,618
- What is that?
- That's a male member.

469
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,527
- I thought you'd met.
- No, Hank. That.

470
00:26:23,296 --> 00:26:24,458
What is that?

471
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:27,890
- That's my groin.
- It's like a lump or something.

472
00:26:31,342 --> 00:26:32,924
Did you always have that?
