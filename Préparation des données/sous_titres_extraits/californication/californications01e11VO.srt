1
00:00:00,164 --> 00:00:01,997
<i>Previously on</i> Californication...

2
00:00:02,267 --> 00:00:03,915
- No kiss?
- I'm done with that.

3
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:06,864
You, on the other hand,
have been a very naughty little smurf.

4
00:00:07,144 --> 00:00:08,205
Bi-curious, are we?

5
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:12,067
He started it spanking his assistant.
It was very sweet, actually.

6
00:00:12,358 --> 00:00:13,804
I want to learn from you.

7
00:00:13,954 --> 00:00:15,802
- I want to be an agent.
- I see.

8
00:00:16,053 --> 00:00:18,179
First, you systematically
destroy my marriage...

9
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:19,931
I know about everything.

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,468
... and now you want me
to help with your career.

11
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:24,875
I don't think you heard me.
I wrote something.

12
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:28,433
- Hank wrote a new book? Can I read it?
- That's not appropriate.

13
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:29,965
Can I help you with anything?

14
00:00:30,256 --> 00:00:32,183
I wrote a novel,
and I was wondering

15
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:34,269
- if Charlie would read it.
- What's it about?

16
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:36,760
A 16-year-old girl
fucks a much, much older man

17
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,100
and finds herself both spiritually
and sexually awakened.

18
00:00:41,363 --> 00:00:42,396
Are you OK?

19
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:46,458
But I'm working on it.

20
00:00:46,749 --> 00:00:50,244
- This book is gonna be huge.
- Are you having second thoughts?

21
00:00:50,386 --> 00:00:53,045
- Are you questioning things?
- I question everything.

22
00:00:53,204 --> 00:00:54,326
It's very healthy.

23
00:00:54,499 --> 00:00:56,703
I just think you can't run off
and marry a guy

24
00:00:56,866 --> 00:00:59,095
after making sweet love
to yours truly.

25
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:02,820
We had women that loved us for
who we were, and we fucked it up.

26
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,129
Ain't life fucking grand?

27
00:01:09,344 --> 00:01:14,070
Subtitles: swsub.com

28
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:26,816
- You look great, mom.
- Thank you, sweetie.

29
00:01:27,503 --> 00:01:30,329
I guess you're going with a more
liberal interpretation of the whole

30
00:01:30,483 --> 00:01:33,530
- "white wedding" concept, are you?
- You think I could go braless?

31
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:36,360
Sorry. Didn't know we had a gentleman
in our presence.

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,773
Only if you go with
a more liberal interpretation

33
00:01:38,926 --> 00:01:40,650
of the whole "gentleman" concept.

34
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:44,121
You know, as exciting as it is
to be behind the scenes

35
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,718
in the girls' locker room
right before the big game,

36
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:49,500
- I think I'm going to take my leave.
- Shit.

37
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:51,295
- My dad's coming.
- What?

38
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:53,728
He was supposed to be
playing racquetball!

39
00:01:53,885 --> 00:01:55,660
Yes, get that thing off!

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,377
The groom shouldn't see you in the dress
before the wedding... It's bad luck.

41
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:01,741
What's worse luck
is getting married itself.

42
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:03,132
Shut up.

43
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,507
Two out of three of those
end in divorce.

44
00:02:05,678 --> 00:02:07,808
Sometimes more... Three out of two.

45
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:14,132
- You look lovely.
- Thank you.

46
00:02:14,323 --> 00:02:17,678
A little uncomfortable coming from you.
You know what? Oatmeal.

47
00:02:18,119 --> 00:02:20,426
- Thanks, daddy.
- You should've seen the dress

48
00:02:20,579 --> 00:02:23,305
Karen had on just now.
I mean, it was like, here...

49
00:02:23,578 --> 00:02:25,634
- Cut it out.
- And then the back...

50
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:27,726
You're home early.

51
00:02:28,149 --> 00:02:30,937
I played Harry Greenberg.
I bageled him.

52
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:32,901
Ironically. You know what?

53
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,034
One day, you and me, Bill Tilden.
<i>Mano a mano.</i>

54
00:02:36,231 --> 00:02:39,560
We're gonna play the real tennis. Not
that sissy kind. We're going '70s style.

55
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:42,642
We're playing wooden rackets,
knee socks. Plum smugglers.

56
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:44,972
- But not today because I gotta go.
- Dad.

57
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:46,536
You can't. Remember?

58
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:50,058
- No. What?
- I have to talk to you and mom.

59
00:02:50,285 --> 00:02:51,765
Really? What about, sweetie?

60
00:02:53,018 --> 00:02:54,419
Family stuff.

61
00:02:54,712 --> 00:02:57,505
We're a family.
Or we will be very soon, right?

62
00:02:57,785 --> 00:03:00,123
So I should say what I feel?
No matter what?

63
00:03:00,392 --> 00:03:02,539
Absolutely. Always.

64
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:04,955
I want to live with dad.

65
00:03:07,649 --> 00:03:09,476
I'll still visit and stuff.

66
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:13,230
I want to live
most of the time with dad.

67
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:17,331
It's the first I've heard of this.

68
00:03:23,549 --> 00:03:26,409
Have you thought this through?
I mean, have you... Becca.

69
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:34,876
Then there were two.

70
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:38,197
I need some help taking off this dress.

71
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,250
And then there was one.

72
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,060
Thank you.

73
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:38,023
Uncle Runkle.

74
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:41,844
- Sorry I'm late. I just...
- You just what?

75
00:04:42,554 --> 00:04:43,987
Nah. That's all I got.

76
00:04:45,449 --> 00:04:48,450
- I do have some news, though.
- Ah! Delight me.

77
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:51,250
Becca's moving back in with me.

78
00:04:52,421 --> 00:04:53,850
- No shit.
- Yeah.

79
00:04:54,408 --> 00:04:56,536
- Poor Karen. She must be...
- Devastated.

80
00:04:56,689 --> 00:04:59,336
- That's brutal.
- It is. The good news is, though,

81
00:04:59,608 --> 00:05:02,060
as of today you and your extensive
porn collection

82
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,805
- are moving in to the Four Seasons.
- Fantastic.

83
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:07,514
I booked you a room in the "husbands
who've been kicked out

84
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:09,597
"by their diminutive
lesbian wives" wing.

85
00:05:09,751 --> 00:05:12,286
Right next to the
"young actresses fresh into town" wing.

86
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:15,547
- Correct?
- I don't know the layout of the hotel.

87
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,397
Well, that is news.
Boy, I'll miss the camaraderie,

88
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:23,068
but that stain in your bedroom
was really starting to unnerve me.

89
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:26,439
You inspired that stain,
you cunning linguist, you.

90
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:28,468
- It's a talent.
- Job well done.

91
00:05:30,171 --> 00:05:32,165
What were you doing
in my bedroom, you perv?

92
00:05:32,389 --> 00:05:35,375
Snooping, of course. Looking for
some fucking words I can sell.

93
00:05:35,567 --> 00:05:37,158
- Good luck with that.
- By the way,

94
00:05:37,349 --> 00:05:40,835
how come you never told me Bill's little
Lolita of a daughter was a writer?

95
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:42,673
'cause I don't use that term loosely.

96
00:05:42,949 --> 00:05:45,156
Writer. Everybody says
they're a writer in this town.

97
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:47,300
I'll give her
"budding wordsmith," maybe.

98
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,960
"Budding," huh?

99
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,965
She's fucking bloomed, pal.

100
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,633
Dani's dripping wet
over this manuscript of hers.

101
00:05:53,825 --> 00:05:57,960
In fact, she insists that I pump it,
launch her agenting career,

102
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,173
or she'll hit me with the mother
of all sexual-harassment suits.

103
00:06:01,452 --> 00:06:03,188
Oh, Charlie, I'm sorry.

104
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:05,837
Can you get me a front-row seat
to the trial?

105
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:08,081
I wanna be behind you
in the courtroom sketches.

106
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:10,663
- You're such a good friend.
- What do you want me to say?

107
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:13,428
- You fuck around with your assistant,
you're gonna get screwed.

108
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:16,554
Only a few things could happen,
all of them bad.

109
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:18,771
You're gonna get threatened,
or sued.

110
00:06:18,913 --> 00:06:20,894
You can go for the trifecta
and get divorced.

111
00:06:21,178 --> 00:06:23,962
And yet, do I get any credit
for all the assistants I <i>didn't</i> fuck?

112
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:25,714
- No, that's an injustice.
- It is.

113
00:06:26,358 --> 00:06:28,508
I get no credit for
all the dicks I do not suck.

114
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,306
- Check, please.
- Then again, I don't know.

115
00:06:33,595 --> 00:06:35,536
If Mia turns out
to really be talented,

116
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:38,218
I could pump this till
I'm blue in the face. No harm no foul.

117
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:39,411
Am I right?

118
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:43,348
She might have some
talent, from what I've seen,

119
00:06:43,502 --> 00:06:46,014
the little I have seen.
What is this thing about?

120
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:48,820
This coverage makes it sound
really fucking hot, you know?

121
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:51,781
There's this young woman
who's banging this older guy,

122
00:06:52,051 --> 00:06:54,224
and at one point, you know,
she hauls off

123
00:06:54,388 --> 00:06:56,910
and just punches him right in the face.
That's...

124
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,120
pretty ballsy right there, right?

125
00:06:59,381 --> 00:07:01,909
I don't know what else happens,
but that's one scene.

126
00:07:02,241 --> 00:07:04,055
- Motherfucker.
- What?

127
00:07:07,633 --> 00:07:09,245
"Fucking & Punching."

128
00:07:15,556 --> 00:07:16,932
This is beyond ballsy.

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,250
Where are you...

130
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,770
What the fuck?

131
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:13,301
I guess you didn't hear me knocking.

132
00:08:14,195 --> 00:08:16,983
No. Well, that's why I let
myself in... Because I figured

133
00:08:17,263 --> 00:08:19,504
you'd probably be out here
in this general vicinity,

134
00:08:19,644 --> 00:08:20,922
unable to hear me knocking.

135
00:08:21,062 --> 00:08:23,819
Out by the pool, kicking it,
you know, after school?

136
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,907
Right. Well, school
doesn't get out till 3:00.

137
00:08:26,057 --> 00:08:28,128
You need to get on top of that
kind of shit, Hank.

138
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:31,601
Is that universal? 'Cause I was over
at Mia's school that day.

139
00:08:31,753 --> 00:08:33,911
It was very progressive,
like they didn't adhere

140
00:08:34,062 --> 00:08:36,273
- to that kind of strict.
- There's no one here.

141
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:38,721
I'm all on my own
in my big, empty house,

142
00:08:38,861 --> 00:08:41,460
just like I will be when you
take my daughter away from me.

143
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,460
Come on.
I had nothing to do with that.

144
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,207
- Really? You didn't put her up to it?
- Of course not. Why would I do that?

145
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:51,371
I don't know. To embarrass me. To score
some big fucking victory over Bill.

146
00:08:51,522 --> 00:08:53,476
- No, I wouldn't do that.
- Your usual shit.

147
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:55,686
No, no, no. I wouldn't do that.

148
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:58,431
So she came up with it
all by herself, out of the blue?

149
00:08:58,656 --> 00:09:00,899
The system that's been working
since we split up,

150
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:03,307
doesn't work anymore?
"I wanna live with dad?

151
00:09:03,447 --> 00:09:05,799
- "I don't wanna live with mom?"
- She's a teenager.

152
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,897
The word you're looking for is
"mercurial."

153
00:09:08,188 --> 00:09:09,809
No, I'm not looking for.

154
00:09:10,156 --> 00:09:12,247
And I would never
fuck with her head like that.

155
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:14,652
Yours, yes.
I can be a dick sometimes.

156
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:17,594
But hers, never. Not in a million years.

157
00:09:19,101 --> 00:09:21,389
- Well, okay.
- What do you mean, "okay"?

158
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:24,583
I mean, "okay, I believe you."
But it's not gonna make any difference.

159
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:26,414
It doesn't make it any easier for me.

160
00:09:26,696 --> 00:09:29,107
But if you think about it
in practical terms, it means

161
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:30,787
2 extra nights a week, right?

162
00:09:31,088 --> 00:09:34,710
- I mean, it's not a big...
- No. Don't, okay? Don't do that.

163
00:09:35,124 --> 00:09:37,221
I don't need
your fucking sympathy, Hank, okay?

164
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:40,992
Get out of my house, 'cause I don't want
to see you right now!

165
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:48,375
Where's Ilsa, she-wolf of the SS?

166
00:09:48,817 --> 00:09:49,847
Excuse me?

167
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:54,061
- Dani. Where's Dani?
- She's in a meeting with Mr. Runkle.

168
00:09:54,349 --> 00:09:55,808
- And you are?
- Going in there.

169
00:09:55,948 --> 00:09:57,991
- I'm sorry, sir.
- Look at the time. The big hand

170
00:09:58,131 --> 00:10:00,348
says "fuck"
and the little one says "off."

171
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,974
All right, I need
to talk to you, and you,

172
00:10:04,234 --> 00:10:05,892
and you need to get out, and you...

173
00:10:06,171 --> 00:10:09,350
You, I don't need to talk to,
but I know you.

174
00:10:09,741 --> 00:10:11,022
Hello, Victoria.

175
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:12,696
Well, so formal.

176
00:10:13,051 --> 00:10:15,527
"Tricky Vicky" he used to
call me back in the day.

177
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,904
Where the hell have you been,
Hank Moody?

178
00:10:18,164 --> 00:10:20,458
Don't you owe me a book since
the good guy is in office?

179
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:23,001
It's been 7 years, thanks.
It's coming along swimmingly.

180
00:10:23,152 --> 00:10:25,767
Spell-checking as we speak.
I need to have a chat with you.

181
00:10:26,237 --> 00:10:29,388
- I'm in the middle of a meeting.
- I can see that. It won't take long.

182
00:10:29,579 --> 00:10:32,268
Hank, do you think you two
could do this a little bit later?

183
00:10:32,408 --> 00:10:35,481
Like after the meeting
that Victoria flew in from New York for?

184
00:10:35,631 --> 00:10:37,052
We should straighten it out now.

185
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:40,255
We have a bunch more set up for later.
We don't want them to stack up.

186
00:10:40,472 --> 00:10:43,549
- I can handle this.
- Well, handle it, then.

187
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,835
Looks like you've got
a live one there, Runkle.

188
00:10:47,509 --> 00:10:50,353
Hank, have a seat.
We can talk about "chinese democracy" as soon as

189
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:52,751
I'm done talking
with the publishing sensation.

190
00:10:53,049 --> 00:10:55,566
I don't know if you're aware,
but this young woman's written

191
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:58,299
- what could be the book of the year.
- Is that right?

192
00:10:58,446 --> 00:11:01,275
Have I ever been wrong about this shit?
It's fantastic.

193
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,785
It's like your early stuff.
Not so juvenile.

194
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,036
Not so many lame boner jokes.

195
00:11:06,312 --> 00:11:08,324
Coincidentally,
I have a lame boner right now.

196
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:10,496
I have a lame boner for justice.

197
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,822
And if you won't give me
a private sidebar right now,

198
00:11:12,986 --> 00:11:15,517
maybe there's something
you'd like to tell these good people?

199
00:11:15,689 --> 00:11:18,173
I don't know. What might
they be interested in hearing?

200
00:11:18,508 --> 00:11:21,250
Come on, Mia. Just... Just out with it.

201
00:11:24,962 --> 00:11:26,957
Oh... Wait.

202
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:29,392
I know what I could say.

203
00:11:30,274 --> 00:11:31,350
Thank you, Hank.

204
00:11:32,174 --> 00:11:34,731
Thank you for giving me notes
and helping me with this.

205
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:36,368
It's been a dream come true,

206
00:11:36,521 --> 00:11:38,981
really to have your favorite writer
in the whole wide world

207
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,133
help you on your very first...

208
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:44,407
- ... novel.
- Hank, you're so sweet.

209
00:11:45,088 --> 00:11:47,302
That's it? That's the way
you want to play it?

210
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:51,498
What do you want me to do, blow you?
I mean, that would be untoward.

211
00:11:51,766 --> 00:11:54,125
My God, look at
the potty mouth on this one.

212
00:11:54,398 --> 00:11:55,423
I love it.

213
00:11:56,221 --> 00:11:59,777
She'd be great with the press, right?
Like Elizabeth Wurtzel... With talent.

214
00:12:00,348 --> 00:12:01,482
Okay, Hank. Let's go.

215
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:25,071
Thank you ever so kindly.

216
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:27,723
So you had your fun
and then you told them the truth, right?

217
00:14:27,863 --> 00:14:29,104
Told them what, Hank?

218
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,701
You know, I think I'd appreciate
your particular brand of humor

219
00:14:32,961 --> 00:14:35,424
a lot more if you weren't
fucking around with my life.

220
00:14:35,564 --> 00:14:37,650
And you haven't fucked around
in mine at all?

221
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,880
I mean, I know it was an accident.
How could you possibly have known?

222
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,570
The fact remains you fucked me
and you didn't wanna have

223
00:14:44,762 --> 00:14:46,983
anything to do with me.
Ladies don't like it.

224
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:50,432
So this is your revenge? You're
some kind of feminist caped crusader?

225
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,221
Yeah, well, we all pay for
our sins sooner or later, Hank.

226
00:14:53,484 --> 00:14:56,057
Thank you... How'd you get ahold of it?

227
00:14:56,323 --> 00:14:59,576
Well, it was just sitting there
all unappreciated and shit,

228
00:14:59,767 --> 00:15:02,256
- and I asked Karen if I could read it.
- And she said "no."

229
00:15:02,803 --> 00:15:06,443
Exactly. She was afraid that
I would get corrupted in some way.

230
00:15:06,917 --> 00:15:08,403
- I'm sure.
- Oh, man.

231
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:11,448
I wonder what'd she think if she
knew I had your dick in my mouth.

232
00:15:11,598 --> 00:15:14,284
But I digress.
Anyway, I took it to Kinko's

233
00:15:14,544 --> 00:15:18,580
and settled in for what was truly
a great read. It's so good, Hank.

234
00:15:20,258 --> 00:15:22,160
A really great first draft.

235
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:26,046
You're gonna get caught, you know.
People are gonna recognize my writing.

236
00:15:26,537 --> 00:15:28,573
No, see, I covered my tracks.

237
00:15:28,906 --> 00:15:31,009
I added little bits of me
when I re-typed it.

238
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:34,471
It's not really so much
an <i>outright</i> theft as a mash-up.

239
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:37,313
An homage, if you will. From me to you.

240
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:41,029
You are a very young...

241
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:43,605
Sociopath-in-training.

242
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:45,303
Oh, come on.

243
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:48,507
That's like Satan calling one
of his junior minions "a big meanie."

244
00:15:48,685 --> 00:15:50,603
Yes, but I never set out
to hurt you, Mia.

245
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:55,520
What else is out there for me? College,
going to Europe, working at an agency,

246
00:15:55,681 --> 00:15:57,464
a network, a studio?

247
00:15:58,046 --> 00:16:00,984
Boring! This has been fun.

248
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:03,333
I never intended to be famous,

249
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:06,555
but I do like
being the center of attention.

250
00:16:06,719 --> 00:16:08,860
It feels just like I thought it would...

251
00:16:09,365 --> 00:16:10,950
Totally fucking great.

252
00:16:13,183 --> 00:16:14,759
But it's gonna go away.

253
00:16:19,087 --> 00:16:21,935
Well, we just got offers
from Victoria Newsome and Little Brown,

254
00:16:22,226 --> 00:16:24,893
but I think Random House
is gonna blow them out of the water.

255
00:16:25,251 --> 00:16:26,460
Random House?

256
00:16:27,281 --> 00:16:30,961
I didn't even know... I miss
these calls? I didn't see messages.

257
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:33,405
No, I didn't think it was
worth bothering you about.

258
00:16:33,849 --> 00:16:37,360
- Some Kahlúa with your coffee?
- We seem to be all out of champagne.

259
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,137
I think the TV people drank it all when
they sold "Slut Wars" into syndication.

260
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,956
No, thank you.

261
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,688
Don't mind if I do.

262
00:16:45,869 --> 00:16:48,016
It's been a great ride,
Charlie Runkle.

263
00:16:48,162 --> 00:16:50,171
We proved sex
and the workplace can mix.

264
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:52,382
We subverted some dominant paradigms.

265
00:16:52,646 --> 00:16:56,344
And from a feminist standpoint, we're
about to launch a major female writer.

266
00:16:56,643 --> 00:17:00,860
She was great, wasn't she?
I mean, she was poised, she was funny...

267
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,644
She had them eating out of her hand and
looking up her skirt at the same time.

268
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,688
Yeah, that is quite a feat.

269
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:10,942
The girl's gonna sell 5 million copies
based on the jacket photo alone.

270
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:14,760
And did you see how completely
unfazed she was by Hank?

271
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,617
I mean, no offense, he's a cool guy,
but it was kind of pathetic, right?

272
00:17:20,627 --> 00:17:23,445
Dani, I actually have a little bit
of a headache.

273
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:27,060
- I'm gonna lie down
here for a while. - Okay.

274
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,127
You rest, I'll take the calls.

275
00:17:53,711 --> 00:17:56,021
So, here's the last of your t-shirts.

276
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:57,580
Thanks.

277
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:00,611
You know, you can always
bring your stuff home,

278
00:18:01,062 --> 00:18:03,681
for me to wash
on the weekends or whenever.

279
00:18:03,939 --> 00:18:04,955
I know.

280
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:10,418
'cause your dad, you know,
he'll probably just buy you new clothes

281
00:18:10,849 --> 00:18:13,648
when the old ones get dirty.
That would be his solution...

282
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,728
I know.

283
00:18:18,968 --> 00:18:20,095
You know...

284
00:18:21,123 --> 00:18:21,928
Yeah.

285
00:18:23,587 --> 00:18:24,400
Shit!

286
00:18:24,699 --> 00:18:26,901
You're not taking <i>everything,</i>
are you?

287
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:29,521
No. Just the essentials.

288
00:18:32,003 --> 00:18:35,050
I'm gonna let you guys...
Give her a hand, yeah?

289
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,900
- Mom?
- Yeah?

290
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,360
You and me...

291
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:42,754
I was thinking next Saturday
we could go to the getty.

292
00:18:43,483 --> 00:18:44,815
Just us.

293
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,050
That'd be great.
I'd love that, sweetie.

294
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:55,660
And so it begins.
The non-custodial parent time.

295
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:59,655
Not the dark side of the moon.
I might want to borrow that one.

296
00:18:59,885 --> 00:19:03,054
- It's way too small for you.
- Yeah. That's why I like it.

297
00:19:03,552 --> 00:19:04,664
Whatever.

298
00:19:05,369 --> 00:19:07,497
Hey, I was just teasing.

299
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:10,119
That's what sisters do, you know?

300
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,554
They borrow clothes, talk about boys,

301
00:19:12,784 --> 00:19:15,350
conspire against the parental units...

302
00:19:18,014 --> 00:19:20,196
It's not gonna be any fun here
without you.

303
00:19:20,462 --> 00:19:21,656
Was it fun before?

304
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:23,906
True.

305
00:19:24,088 --> 00:19:26,711
But you won't have that problem
anymore living with your dad.

306
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:28,950
Sure. It'll be a hoot.

307
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:32,083
Like taking Kafka
to the Third Street Promenade.

308
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:34,532
You're not even excited a little bit?

309
00:19:35,148 --> 00:19:38,193
- I suppose.
- Well, shit, I would be stoked.

310
00:19:38,411 --> 00:19:41,153
'cause your dad, I mean, he's a riot.

311
00:19:41,402 --> 00:19:42,677
He's totally awesome.

312
00:19:42,971 --> 00:19:45,513
I'm not going to live with
my dad because it's fun.

313
00:19:45,783 --> 00:19:47,662
I'm going because I have to.

314
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,018
I don't know if you've noticed,

315
00:19:50,271 --> 00:19:53,683
- but your dad is about to marry my mom.
- Yeah, so?

316
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,568
So it's really happening.

317
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,100
He can't pretend anymore
that it's not.

318
00:19:59,372 --> 00:20:02,822
And whatever miraculous thing he thought
would happen with the writing...

319
00:20:03,185 --> 00:20:05,773
You know, that thing he wrote
back home in New York

320
00:20:05,965 --> 00:20:07,786
that would be
the redemption of us all?

321
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,580
Well, obviously,
that's not happening, either.

322
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,650
Yeah, I guess not.

323
00:20:13,109 --> 00:20:14,459
So it's official.

324
00:20:15,322 --> 00:20:16,683
Rock bottom.

325
00:20:17,232 --> 00:20:18,631
The death of hope.

326
00:20:19,581 --> 00:20:21,268
Can't leave him alone now.

327
00:20:21,543 --> 00:20:23,093
The man's got nothing.

328
00:20:24,154 --> 00:20:26,301
Well, that's not entirely true.

329
00:20:27,694 --> 00:20:28,921
He's got you.

330
00:20:31,344 --> 00:20:33,184
We should all be so lucky.

331
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,018
Loved your new novel.

332
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,241
I knew from the first page.

333
00:21:19,247 --> 00:21:21,605
Strange, too. It was like 1987.

334
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:23,690
I went to a party
with Bret E. Ellis.

335
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,987
I asked him who
the good young writers were.

336
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:29,838
He showed me that short story of yours.
I had the same feeling when I read it.

337
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,287
Like this person and I
are connected somehow.

338
00:21:32,858 --> 00:21:34,998
Like we were gonna do
something special together.

339
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:38,501
Well, I'm just overjoyed that
you saw me in there somewhere.

340
00:21:38,781 --> 00:21:40,441
You're all over it, pal.

341
00:21:40,652 --> 00:21:42,904
But, listen, I got to ask, you know,

342
00:21:43,801 --> 00:21:46,343
since you always tend
to write exactly what you know...

343
00:21:50,035 --> 00:21:51,760
What's the fucking deal?

344
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,470
You have done some
fucked-up shit in your time, but...

345
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:05,779
I didn't think you'd do that.

346
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:07,765
Not knowingly.

347
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:10,930
She tricked you into it?
I find that hard to believe.

348
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,660
She was at a book store,
and she was reading my book.

349
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,242
That's always a great
conversation starter for me,

350
00:22:16,434 --> 00:22:18,999
and she was cute and flirty,
I was half in the bag...

351
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:21,028
I was just right for that moment.

352
00:22:21,219 --> 00:22:23,405
The self-loathing
was strong in me that night.

353
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:25,522
I didn't know she was Bill's daughter,

354
00:22:25,714 --> 00:22:29,001
and I thought she was in college.
You know, maybe older.

355
00:22:30,087 --> 00:22:31,137
I was wrong.

356
00:22:31,555 --> 00:22:32,973
Jesus Christ.

357
00:22:34,247 --> 00:22:36,142
How'd we get ourselves into this one?

358
00:22:36,817 --> 00:22:38,503
Thank you for saying "we."

359
00:22:39,884 --> 00:22:42,458
I'll do whatever
you want me to do, you know?

360
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,943
I'll take it off the counter,
you say the word.

361
00:22:45,634 --> 00:22:46,778
Are there offers?

362
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,090
- Many.
- Well, then I'm fucked.

363
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,870
If I say anything,
if I do anything about this shit,

364
00:22:52,081 --> 00:22:54,048
there's no telling
what she's gonna do.

365
00:22:54,268 --> 00:22:57,095
There's no stopping her
from telling Karen or Bill,

366
00:22:57,330 --> 00:22:59,477
- or Becca.
- Fuck. The police.

367
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:02,223
Fuck the police.

368
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:06,627
Expecting someone?

369
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:13,562
Wait.

370
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:16,363
Let me get that.

371
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:21,739
- Good evening, ladies.
- Hey.

372
00:23:21,931 --> 00:23:23,931
I should get going. Call me later?

373
00:23:24,103 --> 00:23:25,750
- I will.
- <i>Four seasons.</i>

374
00:23:26,467 --> 00:23:28,125
- Good night.
- Night.

375
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:35,533
- I'm gonna go put my stuff down.
- Sure.

376
00:23:40,165 --> 00:23:41,168
I'm sorry.

377
00:23:41,776 --> 00:23:42,868
About what?

378
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:45,478
You won.

379
00:23:46,813 --> 00:23:49,746
Not if you're this upset.
I didn't win a goddamn thing.

380
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,344
I hate seeing you this sad.

381
00:23:52,588 --> 00:23:53,470
Ever.

382
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,444
Except maybe after sex with Bill.

383
00:23:58,617 --> 00:24:01,729
That's a smile. A small smile,
but a smile nonetheless.

384
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,930
I'll take it.

385
00:24:03,772 --> 00:24:06,571
- Don't worry, mom. I'll be fine.
- I know.

386
00:24:06,938 --> 00:24:08,777
And it's not you I'm worried about.

387
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:10,345
I know.

388
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:12,614
But first of all, this is not goodbye.

389
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,778
Just think of it as me on the road
with the band,

390
00:24:15,989 --> 00:24:17,848
playing a few out-of-town gigs.

391
00:24:18,229 --> 00:24:20,278
Plus, you get
a break from my noisy guitar.

392
00:24:20,572 --> 00:24:22,892
Yeah, but I love your noisy guitar.

393
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:26,193
I would say "take care of her," but I think

394
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:28,570
she's probably
gonna take better care of you.

395
00:24:28,858 --> 00:24:30,257
I don't disagree.

396
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,922
Call me if you need anything, okay?

397
00:24:33,554 --> 00:24:34,820
Anything at all.

398
00:24:37,721 --> 00:24:39,158
I love you, honey.

399
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,747
I love you, too.

400
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:47,216
She's highly emotional, that one.

401
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,850
All the good ones are.

402
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:55,429
<i>In exchange, they've given their word
they will only fight</i>

403
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:57,001
<i>Al-Qaeda.</i>

404
00:24:58,171 --> 00:25:01,009
Take a picture. It'll last longer.

405
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,350
Are you okay?

406
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:10,255
- You seem depressed.
- You mean like more than usual?

407
00:25:10,824 --> 00:25:11,821
Yes.

408
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,650
I sense these things.

409
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:15,255
Oh, yeah?

410
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:17,792
I'm peachy.

411
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Trust me.

412
00:25:51,328 --> 00:25:52,351
Hey, Bill?

413
00:25:53,689 --> 00:25:55,146
Hey, honey. Bill?
