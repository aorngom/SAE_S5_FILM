1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:05,232
<i>Previously on Dollhouse...</i>

2
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:06,933
 There are three
flowers in a vase.

3
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:09,733
The third flower is green.

4
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:22,133
Agent Paul Ballard
was suspended of duty,

5
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:24,700
pending an investigation into
the shooting of Officer Harton.

6
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,133
I know at the beginning
of the weekend,

7
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:27,266
we said no strings.
Mm.

8
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,599
<i>We also said no ropes.</i>

9
00:00:29,382 --> 00:00:30,199
<i>Yeah, I remember.</i>

10
00:00:31,677 --> 00:00:33,232
<i>I remember it all.</i>

11
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:34,800
I always will.

12
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,133
<i>Echo's off task.</i>

13
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>Your little brain child
just backfired.</i>

14
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:39,833
<i>She's a risk.</i>

15
00:00:39,866 --> 00:00:41,299
An increasing risk.

16
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:42,666
She had control
of the situation.

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,933
But we can't control her.

18
00:00:47,332 --> 00:00:49,232
Our trouble ends here.

19
00:00:55,966 --> 00:00:57,633
I'm going to make
you an offer.

20
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:01,050
I told you,all I want to be left alone.

21
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:03,167
We both know we're past that.

22
00:01:03,926 --> 00:01:05,433
Gee, what gave it away?

23
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,399
The big, black van?

24
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:09,466
Or the being held in
this room for two days

25
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:11,633
with no frickin'
idea where I am?

26
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:15,833
My offer is this.

27
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:17,806
Your life...

28
00:01:19,061 --> 00:01:20,332
for your life.

29
00:01:22,133 --> 00:01:24,262
I get five years,you get the rest.

30
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:27,700
You'll be free.

31
00:01:28,276 --> 00:01:29,704
Is that you talking?

32
00:01:30,226 --> 00:01:31,893
Or the Rossum Corporation?

33
00:01:33,232 --> 00:01:34,332
Why me?

34
00:01:34,366 --> 00:01:35,466
Why did you pick me?

35
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:37,566
Caroline,
you picked us.

36
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,633
This is a good thing, Caroline.

37
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:43,220
I know what I saw.

38
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:46,811
What started this?

39
00:01:48,664 --> 00:01:49,866
You and I have been
doing this dance

40
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,167
for almost two years.

41
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:54,029
I thought you'd
have learned by now.

42
00:02:06,014 --> 00:02:08,171
Nothing is what
it appears to be.

43
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:16,800
Please, any hack can do
a regenerative study.

44
00:02:16,833 --> 00:02:18,133
Any hack with two years

45
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:20,299
and a 50-million-dollar
lab at their...

46
00:02:22,237 --> 00:02:24,224
Owen?
Fly, be free.

47
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,132
Fly.
Owen?

48
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:32,242
Fly, be free.

49
00:02:33,299 --> 00:02:35,269
Owen, you okay, buddy?

50
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,513
Fly, fly!

51
00:02:36,314 --> 00:02:37,533
Owen?

52
00:02:37,566 --> 00:02:38,499
Fly, fly!

53
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,433
Hey, Owen,
Fly, fly!
it's us.

54
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:42,533
Fly!
Owen?!

55
00:02:42,566 --> 00:02:43,499
Owen, it's okay.

56
00:02:43,533 --> 00:02:45,566
Fly! Fly!
Owen?

57
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,800
Gravity's not the equation.

58
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,000
Owen?! Owen?!

59
00:02:53,033 --> 00:02:55,399
Hey, stop!
Owen, stop!

60
00:02:55,433 --> 00:02:57,067
Oh, my God!

61
00:03:29,425 --> 00:03:30,766
That is one of only

62
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:32,329
two existing vials

63
00:03:32,533 --> 00:03:36,000
of our most promising
new memory drug.

64
00:03:36,033 --> 00:03:37,399
The other vial is missing.

65
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:40,399
I don't need just one
Active on this.

66
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:41,733
I need an army.

67
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,332
I've already
rearranged the schedule.

68
00:03:43,366 --> 00:03:45,000
The boots are as good
as on the ground.

69
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,900
If this is about Foxtrot

70
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:48,811
speaking Mandarin
instead of Cantonese,

71
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,035
it was a very...
Topher.

72
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:54,000
simple...
This is...

73
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,633
Clive Ambrose.

74
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,433
Co-chairman of the,
uh, Rossum Corporation,

75
00:03:59,466 --> 00:04:00,900
third richest man
in the country,

76
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:03,299
nominated for a Nobel Prize.

77
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:06,000
I might throw up.

78
00:04:06,493 --> 00:04:07,747
That's a compliment.

79
00:04:09,866 --> 00:04:11,900
Something really bad happened.

80
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:14,067
There's been an incident
at Freemont College.

81
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,399
Owen Johnson.

82
00:04:15,433 --> 00:04:17,100
He was a grad student

83
00:04:17,133 --> 00:04:19,266
at one of our premiere labs.

84
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:20,792
But not anymore.

85
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:22,566
Owen ingested
a psychotropic

86
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,866
modification of
aphenethylamine compound.

87
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:28,100
One of the memory drugs
Rossum's got in R&D?

88
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:29,841
N-7316.

89
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,233
It breaks down natural
inhibitions in the hippocampus

90
00:04:33,234 --> 00:04:36,084
in order to awaken
sleeping parts of the brain.

91
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:38,474
We're still in the
experimental stage.

92
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:41,372
Phase one of N-7316

93
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:45,119
manifests like a
recreational narcotic.

94
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,900
Giddiness, light
hallucinations.

95
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:48,328
Munchies.

96
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:51,000
Phase two
apparently manifests

97
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,033
as a complete loss
of impulse control.

98
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,499
Could be phases,
could be...

99
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,733
a little thing I'd like
to call body chemistry.

100
00:04:57,766 --> 00:04:59,366
We're all our own little

101
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,633
cesspools of hormones,

102
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,633
enzymes, chemical reactions.

103
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:05,033
It's the same as any drug-

104
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:07,666
heroin,
cocaine, caffeine,

105
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,766
how your body
reacts depends

106
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,199
on a multitude
of indefinable factors.

107
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:16,866
You snort horse once,
don't like it,

108
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,866
you go back to
your organic tea,

109
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,100
have a nice life.
I do it once,

110
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:25,100
Whoo, I'm doing two bags
a day for 20 years.

111
00:05:25,133 --> 00:05:27,499
One toot for you,
adios, amigo.

112
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,366
That's what's
so exciting

113
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,866
about drugs!

114
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:33,633
Not that I'd know.

115
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:35,320
We do biweekly

116
00:05:35,321 --> 00:05:36,130
drug tests.

117
00:05:36,349 --> 00:05:39,866
Just pure
scientific observations.

118
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,232
How did the drug find its way

119
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:42,766
into the general
campus population?

120
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:44,287
We don't know.

121
00:05:45,033 --> 00:05:46,566
Maybe Owen was selling it.

122
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:48,900
Maybe he or someone else
put it in the soda machine

123
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:50,900
in the dining hall.

124
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,733
One vial is enough to take out
the entire student body.

125
00:05:54,766 --> 00:05:56,700
No antidote floating
around, I'm guessing.

126
00:05:56,733 --> 00:05:58,900
Right now the best
we can do is sedation.

127
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,666
We're hoping you can
help us do better.

128
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,466
While you work on an antidote,
a team of Actives will

129
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:05,232
secure the campus
and try to locate

130
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:06,933
the missing vial.

131
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:08,966
Oh, right.
They'd be immune.

132
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,693
How did you know that?

133
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:14,199
All right, this baby attacks

134
00:06:14,232 --> 00:06:16,167
the inhibitors
in the hippocampus

135
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:18,866
to break down the repressed
memory blocks, right?

136
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,483
Actives don't have them.

137
00:06:20,566 --> 00:06:22,167
Stuff would bounce
right off them.

138
00:06:22,604 --> 00:06:24,103
Think you can
help us, Mr. Brink?

139
00:06:24,631 --> 00:06:25,934
Well, I can't hurt.

140
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:29,427
Prob-Probably.

141
00:06:40,433 --> 00:06:43,466
Start with the imprints and
get the Actives in the field.

142
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,126
If you need any extra help,

143
00:06:45,127 --> 00:06:46,280
Cool.

144
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:48,399
Echo's on an
engagement, right?

145
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:50,100
Yeah, old client,
new fantasy.

146
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,299
I should call
her back in?

147
00:06:51,332 --> 00:06:53,933
No, she can sit
this one out.

148
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:00,866
So, what do you think?

149
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,866
Wow, I've never seen
anything like it.

150
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,772
It looks like a dragon.

151
00:07:07,773 --> 00:07:08,730
Is that stupid?

152
00:07:09,184 --> 00:07:10,166
Uh, here.

153
00:07:10,332 --> 00:07:11,966
Oh, no, thank you.

154
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,119
Alice, you're going
to drive this bike.

155
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:15,900
I am?

156
00:07:15,933 --> 00:07:17,067
Yeah.

157
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,133
You're gonna do a lot
of new things today.

158
00:07:20,866 --> 00:07:21,966
Okay!

159
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,433
Wow.

160
00:07:34,566 --> 00:07:36,933
Are you making
breakfast?

161
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:37,908
It's kind of late,

162
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:40,140
but since I'm a
gentleman of leisure,

163
00:07:40,142 --> 00:07:42,499
and you've taken up
professional sleeping.

164
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:44,100
Mmm...

165
00:07:44,133 --> 00:07:45,800
Didn't know I could
cook, did you?

166
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,100
Nope.

167
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,167
Good.

168
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:49,199
Then you won't be disappointed

169
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:50,566
when you find out I can't.

170
00:07:51,966 --> 00:07:53,800
Paul, listen.

171
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,358
Take those off
'cause they're done.

172
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,499
And listen.

173
00:08:00,347 --> 00:08:01,613
I'm a grown-up person.

174
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:03,167
We've got...

175
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:05,266
impulsive and

176
00:08:05,299 --> 00:08:06,700
five minutes later,

177
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:09,599
someone nearly killed me
in your apartment.

178
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:11,700
I know you feel an
obligation... That is not what...

179
00:08:11,733 --> 00:08:12,898
Hey!

180
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,833
I don't think you don't like me.

181
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,733
But we don't fast-forward
to the honeymoon

182
00:08:16,766 --> 00:08:18,266
just because I had a bad day.

183
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:20,722
I like taking care of you.

184
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:23,671
I'm glad.

185
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:25,618
I think you're dreamy.

186
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,733
But in my dream,
I'm stronger than you know.

187
00:08:28,766 --> 00:08:30,266
I think you proved
that when you...

188
00:08:30,299 --> 00:08:31,366
That was luck.

189
00:08:31,399 --> 00:08:32,466
I'm not a prize fighter.

190
00:08:32,499 --> 00:08:34,100
That Russian thug
had two left feet.

191
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:35,566
I wish he had.

192
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,399
It would have been a lot easier
to ID a guy with two left feet.

193
00:08:39,807 --> 00:08:40,700
They did ID him.

194
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,566
They got a name which I
guarantee you wasn't his.

195
00:08:43,968 --> 00:08:45,839
I took a set of prints myself,
though.

196
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,656
Got a friend who can
access a few databases

197
00:08:47,657 --> 00:08:48,812
outside
of the bureau's reach.

198
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:50,700
The Dollhouse found
this guy somewhere.

199
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:52,166
Professional killers
are made.

200
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:54,733
They're trained.

201
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:56,100
I'm sorry.

202
00:08:56,133 --> 00:08:58,133
You don't want
to talk about this.

203
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,433
You're off the case.

204
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,645
Officially.

205
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,133
They suspended you!

206
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,833
So far as the Dollhouse
is concerned,

207
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:06,199
I'm not a threat anymore.

208
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:07,633
This is
the perfect time...

209
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:09,766
You can't drop it.

210
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,199
You said you thought
this was important.

211
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:12,800
And they tried to kill me!

212
00:09:13,634 --> 00:09:14,546
Mellie,

213
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:16,499
I promise you...

214
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,399
You can't promise!

215
00:09:19,169 --> 00:09:21,572
It's blind luck that
I'm not dead already.

216
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,543
<i>What you can do
is drop the case.</i>

217
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,191
Let someone else
handle it.

218
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:37,558
Yeah,

219
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,630
you love taking
care of me.

220
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,232
I think you know your way
across the hall.

221
00:10:07,427 --> 00:10:08,200
Go.

222
00:10:11,103 --> 00:10:16,162
<i>???</i>

223
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:17,554
<i>We're going to do the grid.</i>

224
00:10:17,874 --> 00:10:19,854
Six guys and girls,
women-

225
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,733
searching this campus
top to bottom.

226
00:10:21,766 --> 00:10:23,866
I want that other vial.

227
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,733
Tom, this is
Dr. Gawa

228
00:10:28,766 --> 00:10:30,433
from the Center for
Disease Control.

229
00:10:30,466 --> 00:10:32,033
Super. I haven't heard a good

230
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:34,471
flesh-eating-strain-of-something
horrible story in a while.

231
00:10:34,472 --> 00:10:35,556
Yeah, I've got dozens.

232
00:10:35,789 --> 00:10:37,477
Hopefully today won't be worth
talking about.

233
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:39,199
Let's find these kids
and get them better.

234
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:41,232
I've got you set up at the
Kappa Zeta Chi House.

235
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:42,666
And, Tom, you'll be
running the grid.

236
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,800
Uh, the grid's taken care of.

237
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,366
I'll be too busy rounding up
our day-trippers

238
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,366
to look under mattresses.

239
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,232
That's my call.

240
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:48,533
Actually, it's mine.

241
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:53,816
You're NSA?

242
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:56,197
Which outranks Rossum
private security

243
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,266
by more than
a whole bunch.

244
00:10:58,299 --> 00:10:59,268
Topher.

245
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:00,766
All right, fine, I'll stay here

246
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,000
and be the communications
command post.

247
00:11:03,033 --> 00:11:04,933
First have someone show
Dr. Gawa to Kappa House.

248
00:11:04,966 --> 00:11:06,167
You good?
Yeah.

249
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:08,033
I've always wanted to
go to a frat party.

250
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,199
<i>Are you sure you're okay?
I'm okay,</i>

251
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:14,966
if you're okay.

252
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,733
I'm great!

253
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:17,966
Is that terrible?

254
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,599
No, it's wonderful.

255
00:11:21,344 --> 00:11:21,866
I'm not sure

256
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,100
how to work this, but... Okay.

257
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:25,733
Oh, God, what if somebody
sees it?

258
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:26,766
Only us.

259
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
Okay, my life on it.

260
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:30,133
I never thought I'd...

261
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:34,033
Oh, I've lost picture.

262
00:11:35,043 --> 00:11:35,466
Sorry.

263
00:11:35,499 --> 00:11:36,966
No just, uh...

264
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,933
On the side.
There's a button.

265
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,100
Oh.

266
00:11:41,332 --> 00:11:43,866
The tragic suicide

267
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,621
appears to be a case
of the stressed-out student

268
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,466
who didn't know
how to ask for help.

269
00:11:48,824 --> 00:11:50,478
Freemont College officials said

270
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,609
that counseling
will be available

271
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,459
on campus throughout the week.

272
00:11:57,167 --> 00:11:58,374
I have to go.

273
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:00,766
I have to help him.

274
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,033
Alice, is-is everything
all right?

275
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,033
I'm terribly sorry.

276
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:04,133
I have to go.
Yeah,

277
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,067
very funny.

278
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,700
I have to get him out of there.

279
00:12:07,617 --> 00:12:09,499
Okay, it's...

280
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:12,499
it's not actually that funny!

281
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,599
Alice?

282
00:12:17,254 --> 00:12:18,966
That was a door.

<i>You know what I want
to do tonight?</i>

287
00:12:53,807 --> 00:12:55,794
Let's drive to that
thing up north.

288
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,393
You know, we don't have to go

289
00:12:58,394 --> 00:13:01,144
to every antiwar demonstration
in the state.

290
00:13:01,145 --> 00:13:02,051
Yes, we do.

291
00:13:02,228 --> 00:13:05,539
Coraline I love U
I love you.

292
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:21,817
Are you comfortable?

293
00:13:22,518 --> 00:13:23,645
Yes, thank you.

294
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:25,911
I'm going to
give you a shot.

295
00:13:25,912 --> 00:13:28,081
And then I just need you
to sit still for a while.

296
00:13:28,647 --> 00:13:29,660
Can you do that?

297
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:30,847
If you like.

298
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:33,967
Just think about
pretty things.

299
00:13:34,001 --> 00:13:36,134
Rainbows.

300
00:13:37,324 --> 00:13:40,178
She's immune, but dosing her
will help me find an antidote.

301
00:13:50,016 --> 00:13:51,487
All righty.

302
00:13:52,011 --> 00:13:54,490
Let's see exactly
what this stuff is doing

303
00:13:54,491 --> 00:13:55,846
so we can undo it.

304
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,050
This may take a while.

305
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:00,920
Be patient.

306
00:14:01,167 --> 00:14:02,970
What shall I do,
think about rainbows?

307
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:04,769
Go for it.

308
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:05,522
Or shall I
think about

309
00:14:05,523 --> 00:14:08,025
how that glorified dog's
body, Clive Ambrose,

310
00:14:08,026 --> 00:14:09,320
can't keep his
affairs in order?

311
00:14:11,734 --> 00:14:13,600
Oh. You could have said no.

312
00:14:13,634 --> 00:14:16,734
The Rossum Corporation
is why we exist.

313
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:18,625
And I believe
in the work we're funding.

314
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,989
I also believe
that the only reason

315
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,475
I don't have Clive Ambrose's job

316
00:14:22,476 --> 00:14:23,851
is 'cause
he couldn't handle mine.

317
00:14:24,801 --> 00:14:27,144
Oh. So, now we're sharing. Aha.

318
00:14:27,145 --> 00:14:28,426
Can you just figure out a way
to keep people

319
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:30,265
from killing themselves
on this drug?

320
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:32,700
We have more than a few
in the early stages,

321
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:34,355
and sedating them
is hardly a cure.

322
00:14:34,356 --> 00:14:35,353
It'll buy me time.

323
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,653
As long as we keep the place
locked down

324
00:14:37,654 --> 00:14:38,893
and don't have
any more X factors,

325
00:14:38,894 --> 00:14:41,199
then here I come
to save the day.

326
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:50,867
Can you get me a juice box?

327
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,549
Are you lost?

328
00:15:16,886 --> 00:15:17,498
Hi.

329
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:18,471
Um...

330
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:21,114
no.

331
00:15:22,127 --> 00:15:22,970
Do you go to Freemont?

332
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:25,834
Um...

333
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:27,675
I don't know.

334
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,359
Th-There's parts
that seem...

335
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,634
I- I... I don't know.

336
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:33,743
You can come
with us.

337
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:35,439
We got one more.

338
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:41,811
Where are
we going?

339
00:15:45,776 --> 00:15:47,597
No, I don't know
anything is wrong.

340
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:49,756
Maybe that's the client's
new fantasy.

341
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,398
Send a Doll to college.

342
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,719
Well, which college?

343
00:15:53,355 --> 00:15:54,221
Uh, Freemont.

344
00:15:54,564 --> 00:15:55,637
I tracked Echo here.

345
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:56,993
Oh, please God, be joking.

346
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:58,028
Why? What's up?

347
00:15:58,534 --> 00:15:59,131
Phew!

348
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:02,734
Your brain rocks!

349
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:05,367
<i>We have a major engagement
happening there.</i>

350
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,767
<i>Echo cannot interfere
with it.</i>

351
00:16:06,768 --> 00:16:07,994
Get her out of there quickly.

352
00:16:07,995 --> 00:16:09,659
And if you need assistance,
call Dominic.

353
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:10,773
Do you understand?

354
00:16:11,463 --> 00:16:13,382
Hold on. Yes?

355
00:16:13,383 --> 00:16:15,921
There are mansions
in your eyes.

356
00:16:16,353 --> 00:16:17,734
Did you know that?

357
00:16:19,653 --> 00:16:21,298
You can see the doors...

358
00:16:26,567 --> 00:16:27,759
Excuse me.

359
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:33,186
No, I definitely
don't understand.

360
00:16:35,477 --> 00:16:36,240
<i>I don't think</i>

361
00:16:36,241 --> 00:16:38,292
I'm supposed to be here. Sit down.

362
00:16:38,293 --> 00:16:40,252
I'm just going to give you
a little shot. Sit down.

363
00:16:40,828 --> 00:16:41,860
The television made me.

364
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:42,962
I had to come here.

365
00:16:43,647 --> 00:16:45,087
A shot of what exactly?

366
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,056
You ingested a
powerful narcotic.

367
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:48,432
I need to make sure
you don't hurt yourself.

368
00:16:48,433 --> 00:16:50,439
Oh, Matt and I don't do drugs.

369
00:16:50,794 --> 00:16:52,648
I have somewhere to be,
not here.

370
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:54,604
Just relax.

371
00:16:54,757 --> 00:16:56,251
<i>What do they need babies for?</i>

372
00:16:56,868 --> 00:16:57,635
Rossum.

373
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,171
No! I don't think she wants the shot.

374
00:17:00,934 --> 00:17:01,856
Look, I'm not
on drugs!

375
00:17:04,146 --> 00:17:05,285
The window glass.

376
00:17:05,286 --> 00:17:06,732
It's coming
for us.

377
00:17:07,034 --> 00:17:07,470
Fine.

378
00:17:07,471 --> 00:17:08,826
I'll get you
the liquid gel.

379
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:09,533
You, too.

380
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:13,032
Don't worry.
It wears off.

381
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:15,191
I mean, I'm starting
to feel normal again.

382
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,750
Sort of.

383
00:17:17,025 --> 00:17:18,346
The walls stopped moving.

384
00:17:19,033 --> 00:17:20,271
I'm not supposed
to be here.

385
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:21,308
I have to save him.

386
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:23,130
Who?

387
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,696
I love you.

388
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,185
I don't know. Him.

389
00:17:28,185 --> 00:17:29,707
I have to get
into Rossum.

390
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:30,895
The Rossum lab?

391
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,524
This about Owen?

392
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:33,881
What do you know
about Rossum?

393
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:35,979
Just that I have to
get into the building.

394
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,826
You know, I think
they did this.

395
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:41,036
Put something in the water,
using us as guinea pigs.

396
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:42,740
Guinea pigs?

397
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,211
Well, yeah, I mean,
I'm guessing

398
00:17:44,212 --> 00:17:46,283
that we're all nice,
neat entries

399
00:17:46,284 --> 00:17:47,653
in someone's lab journal.

400
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:49,749
You know, uh,
this many affected,

401
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:51,688
this many hurt...

402
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,289
gone.

403
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,527
They killed my friend.

404
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,747
I have to get to the lab.

405
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:01,862
Good luck.

406
00:18:01,863 --> 00:18:03,630
I mean, it's surrounded
by security guards.

407
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:04,935
No, I can get in.

408
00:18:05,987 --> 00:18:07,899
I just have to
listen to myself.

409
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,530
You're serious?
Yeah.

410
00:18:10,453 --> 00:18:13,167
I know a way in,
I... I think.

411
00:18:14,869 --> 00:18:16,258
Which kind of
freaks me out.

412
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,434
Okay, well,
I'll help you.

413
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:20,543
I mean, I know that lab
like the back of my hand.

414
00:18:20,544 --> 00:18:22,432
Oh, no. You don't
have to do that.

415
00:18:22,432 --> 00:18:24,275
Well, I'm not gonna let you
go in there by yourself.

416
00:18:25,392 --> 00:18:26,558
Anyway, it's not just for you.

417
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,809
I mean, I want to find evidence,
prove they did this,

418
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,461
and get their asses
sent to jail.

419
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,263
I'm Sam.

420
00:18:33,664 --> 00:18:36,674
I think I'm glad I met you. 
Alice.

421
00:18:37,034 --> 00:18:37,863
We got to get out of here.

422
00:18:38,173 --> 00:18:38,879
Stuff!

423
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,148
It's all too big!

424
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:49,976
No!¡­???¡­

425
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,991
Wow. That worked.
Thank you.

426
00:19:06,764 --> 00:19:07,861
Let's get out
of sight, okay?

427
00:19:07,862 --> 00:19:08,971
Come on.
Yeah.

428
00:19:13,764 --> 00:19:14,904
Would you like
to have a treatment?

429
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:18,360
No.

430
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:26,472
Hey.

431
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:27,893
Wow.

432
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:32,696
Did not maintain control
of that situation.

433
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,174
I don't want to say evil?

434
00:19:43,243 --> 00:19:44,905
Yeah. Yeah, you really do.

435
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:47,025
Oh, the Rossum
Corporation is evil.

436
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:50,187
"Minds Matter. "
Ugh!

437
00:19:50,369 --> 00:19:51,978
This guy gives me
the heebie-jeebies.

438
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:54,697
Clive Ambrose,
the face of Rossum.

439
00:19:54,938 --> 00:19:58,598
Marketing campaign that big-
he's hiding something.

440
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,399
That whole company's
hiding something.

441
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:02,294
Yeah, for instance,
animal testing.

442
00:20:02,637 --> 00:20:03,781
I mean, monkeys, puppies.

443
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:05,249
They're
torturing them.

444
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,185
Kicking it Mengele-style,
all in the name of science.

445
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:08,953
Monkeys should not
be guinea pigs.

446
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:10,778
Guinea pigs should not be guinea pigs.

447
00:20:10,903 --> 00:20:12,174
Whatever they say
in those ads,

448
00:20:12,341 --> 00:20:14,602
<i>the ends don't
justify the means.</i>

449
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:16,491
I have a plan.

450
00:20:16,725 --> 00:20:18,311
I have the beginnings of a plan.

451
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:19,531
Is this when you free
all the monkeys,

452
00:20:19,532 --> 00:20:21,400
and they go nuts
and bite you to death?

453
00:20:21,401 --> 00:20:24,344
No. This is where we film
the monkeys in their cages

454
00:20:24,345 --> 00:20:25,781
and put the
footage online.

455
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,461
Yeah, where millions
can view it

456
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:28,753
over and over again.

457
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:31,113
Mm. They'll be shamed
into policy changes.

458
00:20:31,244 --> 00:20:32,739
And we get in... how?

459
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:34,855
I mean, Rossum's got
to have security.

460
00:20:35,903 --> 00:20:36,779
I'm working on that part.

461
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:39,866
This is not
how we used to party.

462
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:43,218
I spent four years partying
in the shadow of that building.

463
00:20:43,349 --> 00:20:45,689
Do you know what they could have
done in there in four years?

464
00:20:46,138 --> 00:20:48,698
How many living creatures
they...

465
00:20:48,699 --> 00:20:51,199
Ugh! Someone has to stand up.

466
00:20:51,655 --> 00:20:52,875
It doesn't have
to be you guys.

467
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,319
I- I wouldn't
ask it.

468
00:20:54,546 --> 00:20:56,668
This is just where I am.

469
00:20:58,301 --> 00:20:59,353
Yup.

470
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:01,937
That's my girl.

471
00:21:01,938 --> 00:21:02,697
That's my Caroline.

472
00:21:02,698 --> 00:21:03,453
Mmm.

473
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,487
Get on all of this. James?

474
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:12,734
Nothing yet, sir.

475
00:21:12,735 --> 00:21:15,088
Well, I don't have to tell
you to keep looking, but...

476
00:21:15,089 --> 00:21:16,219
Keep looking.

477
00:21:16,421 --> 00:21:17,947
Sure. Now you're experts.

478
00:21:17,948 --> 00:21:18,594
Four hours ago,

479
00:21:18,595 --> 00:21:20,764
you were discussing your love
for apple sauce.

480
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:38,468
Well, my guys have got this
fairly well-contained.

481
00:21:38,469 --> 00:21:39,895
14 subjects exhibiting

482
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:41,678
erratic behavior, sedated.

483
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,484
What?

484
00:21:45,485 --> 00:21:46,815
We rounded up 14...

485
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,427
You okay?

486
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:50,594
I'm fine.

487
00:21:52,334 --> 00:21:53,214
Go on.

488
00:21:53,698 --> 00:21:54,436
Four...

489
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:56,231
14 round what?

490
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:57,068
Buddy?
Hmm?

491
00:21:58,188 --> 00:21:59,612
How about we head
over to containment?

492
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:01,174
I'm fine.

493
00:22:01,371 --> 00:22:02,908
Dr. Gawa will give
you a light sedative...

494
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:04,247
Hey, I'm fine.

495
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:05,702
All right. Easy, buddy.

496
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:07,405
I know how to solve problems.

497
00:22:07,949 --> 00:22:08,635
You bet.

498
00:22:12,653 --> 00:22:14,607
Oh, man, this is so heavy.

499
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:16,933
It makes my arms tired.

500
00:22:18,434 --> 00:22:19,500
Want me to help you out
with that?

501
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:22,272
Thank you. Okay, here we go.

502
00:22:26,674 --> 00:22:27,648
Hey, wow.

503
00:22:27,649 --> 00:22:30,004
It's...
It's so heavy.

504
00:22:30,042 --> 00:22:32,197
Right. Okay. Extremely.
Everything's heavy.

505
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:34,539
Yeah, I need to speak
to the person in charge

506
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,740
at the security office.

507
00:22:35,926 --> 00:22:36,709
I see.

508
00:22:37,984 --> 00:22:40,065
Please, do keep me updated.

509
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:42,595
And please take care of him.

510
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:44,354
Thank you, Agent.

511
00:22:45,469 --> 00:22:46,916
This is unbelievable.

512
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,843
What part was believable before?

513
00:22:48,844 --> 00:22:51,693
The drug. It's not
being sold, Topher.

514
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:53,602
The effects are spreading.

515
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:55,835
Mr. Dominic is exhibiting
erratic behavior.

516
00:22:57,155 --> 00:22:58,694
He didn't take any.

517
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,545
There's no way Dom would
consciously try and have fun.

518
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:03,974
It could be airborne.

519
00:23:03,975 --> 00:23:05,195
We'd be seeing a lot more cases

520
00:23:05,196 --> 00:23:06,532
on the campus. Beyond even.

521
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:08,306
Exposure to a patient,

522
00:23:08,307 --> 00:23:11,111
whether viral,
or through touch...

523
00:23:14,729 --> 00:23:17,145
That spreads more slowly,
but pretty soon,

524
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:20,014
that campus is gonna fill up
with wacky time bombs.

525
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:21,211
Well, we need to
know what it is.

526
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:25,034
Yes, well, we will...
when I figure it out.

527
00:23:25,085 --> 00:23:27,093
And reversing the effect?
You making any progress?

528
00:23:27,094 --> 00:23:29,866
I'm working! What are you
doing besides being...

529
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,810
Being what?
Wait a minute.

530
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:33,550
Sarcastic?
Unfeeling?

531
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:34,887
British?
It's an animal.

532
00:23:34,888 --> 00:23:36,339
Where?
No! The word!

533
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:40,313
Still, you have to admit,
I am... very... British.

534
00:23:40,314 --> 00:23:43,902
I don't say hard Rs.

535
00:23:43,903 --> 00:23:47,065
You know what I like?
Brown sauce.

536
00:23:47,066 --> 00:23:48,084
What's it made of?

537
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:49,805
Science doesn't know.

538
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:51,332
It's made of brown.
Brown...

539
00:23:51,834 --> 00:23:54,477
mined from the earth
by the hardscrabble brown miners

540
00:23:54,478 --> 00:23:55,808
of North Brownderton.

541
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,710
Oh, my God!

542
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:01,489
I find lentils completely
incomprehensible.

543
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:05,607
What the sun-dappled hell
is Echo doing at Freemont?

544
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:07,685
That's got nothing
to do with the drug.

545
00:24:07,912 --> 00:24:08,841
Which means,

546
00:24:09,967 --> 00:24:11,652
our problems are huge

547
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,327
and indomitable.

548
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:16,568
Ooh. I could eat that word.

549
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:18,023
Or a crisp.

550
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,468
Do you have any crisps?

551
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:20,938
You haven't seen my drawer

552
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:22,282
of inappropriate starches?

553
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:25,067
Come on.

554
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,496
Ah.

555
00:24:26,497 --> 00:24:28,514
Oh, my God, I'm having
such a terrible day.

556
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:33,263
Well, sorry it's not much,

557
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,804
but the, uh, scholarship
doesn't cover a decorating fee.

558
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
It's nice.

559
00:24:39,496 --> 00:24:41,462
So, you used to
go to school here?

560
00:24:41,835 --> 00:24:43,222
No. I went back east.

561
00:24:43,761 --> 00:24:45,990
I think. I mean, I did.

562
00:24:46,064 --> 00:24:47,352
I went to Colby.

563
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:51,291
Okay. So,
someone you know went here.

564
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,101
A boyfriend?

565
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:55,089
I don't know.

566
00:24:55,841 --> 00:24:58,316
I mean, I woke up this morning,
and everything was normal.

567
00:24:58,317 --> 00:24:59,707
And then,
I met Matt,

568
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,248
and... we did stuff.

569
00:25:02,249 --> 00:25:04,494
And then, I saw
the Rossum Building on TV,

570
00:25:04,495 --> 00:25:05,569
and I had to leave, and...

571
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:06,892
and I-I can't really deal

572
00:25:06,893 --> 00:25:08,318
with a lot of
questions right now.

573
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:09,371
Yeah.

574
00:25:09,503 --> 00:25:10,720
It's been a, um...

575
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:13,643
weird, bad day.

576
00:25:13,973 --> 00:25:14,751
Say no more.

577
00:25:15,136 --> 00:25:15,983
Okay, so...

578
00:25:15,984 --> 00:25:17,182
we are here,

579
00:25:18,055 --> 00:25:18,968
and...

580
00:25:18,969 --> 00:25:20,487
Rossum Building is here.

581
00:25:21,464 --> 00:25:22,686
The lab is on the
second floor.

582
00:25:23,516 --> 00:25:24,746
That's where
I save him.

583
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:27,313
Well, Alice, I don't want you
to expect too much.

584
00:25:27,579 --> 00:25:28,714
There may not be a "him".

585
00:25:29,045 --> 00:25:31,187
There might not be the proof
against Rossum

586
00:25:31,188 --> 00:25:33,431
you're looking for, either,
but that's not stopping you.

587
00:25:33,432 --> 00:25:35,041
Nothing stops me-
my mother's voice

588
00:25:35,042 --> 00:25:36,104
is too loud in my ear.

589
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:37,713
Ah... mama's boy.

590
00:25:37,714 --> 00:25:38,860
I ain't got
no choice.

591
00:25:38,861 --> 00:25:40,025
I'm all she's got.

592
00:25:40,412 --> 00:25:42,804
So, you remember how
to get in this building?

593
00:25:44,269 --> 00:25:45,354
Underneath.

594
00:25:45,571 --> 00:25:46,524
That's the way in.

595
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:49,194
Okay, you're not overwhelming me
with specificity.

596
00:25:55,004 --> 00:25:56,268
Lily Foundry.

597
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:00,359
We have to find Lily Foundry.

598
00:26:02,484 --> 00:26:03,985
Listen to me carefully.

599
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,776
I've got a huge phalanx
of machines that go ping,

600
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:12,805
and this is carried
by anyone exposed to it.

601
00:26:12,806 --> 00:26:13,707
Through touch.

602
00:26:15,369 --> 00:26:17,157
It is mandated

603
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,536
that you get any Rossum
operatives

604
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,444
off the grounds
and send them back here.

605
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:23,661
Say hi for me.

606
00:26:23,662 --> 00:26:26,626
Nope, you Dolls, you're...

607
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:30,374
By which, of
course, I mean

608
00:26:30,375 --> 00:26:33,896
NSA, CDC folks...

609
00:26:34,317 --> 00:26:35,822
you're safe as houses.

610
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:38,049
Because of the government.

611
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:40,854
They do things.

612
00:26:41,909 --> 00:26:43,118
But anyone else

613
00:26:43,119 --> 00:26:45,433
who comes in contact
with the drug

614
00:26:45,434 --> 00:26:47,072
is susceptible.

615
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:48,302
Am I sure?

616
00:26:49,762 --> 00:26:51,266
I am fairly sure.

617
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:56,909
Secret Agent Victor is so lofty.

618
00:26:58,397 --> 00:26:59,809
I have a good story about him.

619
00:27:00,017 --> 00:27:01,907
Hold on.¡­

620
00:27:02,605 --> 00:27:04,534
I have a... I have another call.

621
00:27:04,535 --> 00:27:05,354
I have another call.

622
00:27:05,355 --> 00:27:06,223
I have a better call.

623
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:07,089
Boyd!

624
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,402
Did you find Echo?

625
00:27:08,983 --> 00:27:09,688
What...

626
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:12,244
Boyd.

627
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:16,040
Did you find Echo?

628
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,280
It's all right, Ms. DeWitt.

629
00:27:17,281 --> 00:27:18,240
I've, I've worked it out.

630
00:27:18,242 --> 00:27:19,244
Worked out what?

631
00:27:20,092 --> 00:27:22,219
Is Echo contained?

632
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,023
Just listen.

633
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:00,079
It's around here
somewhere.

634
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:01,584
<i>You mean she's
around here.</i>

635
00:28:01,752 --> 00:28:02,918
I don't think
it's a person.

636
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:04,560
I think Lily Foundry
is an it.

637
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:07,501
So, we're looking
for an it?

638
00:28:07,625 --> 00:28:08,392
Uh-huh.

639
00:28:09,346 --> 00:28:10,262
Caroline.

640
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,097
Caroline Farrell!

641
00:28:13,555 --> 00:28:14,409
Excuse me?

642
00:28:15,202 --> 00:28:16,739
I knew that was you.

643
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,014
That's not me.

644
00:28:19,015 --> 00:28:19,669
I'm sorry.

645
00:28:20,197 --> 00:28:21,334
Professor Janak.

646
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:24,797
We charted the whole history
of the Americas together.

647
00:28:24,798 --> 00:28:27,151
Her name is Alice,
but have a good day.

648
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:30,814
I don't know this person,
do I?

649
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,946
I know, she's...
she's tweaked.

650
00:28:32,947 --> 00:28:34,079
She needs to be sedated.

651
00:28:45,528 --> 00:28:46,722
We make choices.

652
00:28:49,351 --> 00:28:51,617
I'm well aware that there
are forces beyond our control,

653
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:54,195
but even in the face of those
forces, we make choices.

654
00:28:54,926 --> 00:28:56,267
And then we live with them.

655
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,528
And then we die with them.

656
00:29:02,478 --> 00:29:06,061
I know why Echo
went to Freemont.

657
00:29:07,086 --> 00:29:08,302
To punish you?

658
00:29:08,566 --> 00:29:10,335
To let Caroline punish me.

659
00:29:11,523 --> 00:29:13,547
Are you ever gonna shut up about her?

660
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,437
Is she what you think about
when you're in me?

661
00:29:22,729 --> 00:29:23,116
Would you

662
00:29:23,117 --> 00:29:24,167
let me die, Paul?

663
00:29:24,168 --> 00:29:26,467
Would you be relieved?

664
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:32,367
You said it didn't
affect them.

665
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:33,916
She's not tripping.

666
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,513
She's glitching.

667
00:29:36,595 --> 00:29:38,037
She's remembering.

668
00:29:48,502 --> 00:29:50,169
There are three
flowers in a vase.

669
00:29:50,604 --> 00:29:52,955
The third flower is green.

670
00:29:57,234 --> 00:29:58,985
"There are three flowers
in a vase. "

671
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,004
Then my odyssey takes me
to the city clerk's office,

672
00:30:06,005 --> 00:30:06,900
where, it turns out,

673
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:08,900
the counter jockeys aren't
opposed to a little

674
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:11,000
"you scratch my back
with a wad of cash,

675
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:13,634
and I scratch yours with
sealed planning records. "

676
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,434
And voilà.

677
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:16,564
Blueprints.

678
00:30:16,886 --> 00:30:17,911
I'm riveted.

679
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:19,867
You are a
snide bitch.

680
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:21,690
I know- I love that
about me.

681
00:30:21,691 --> 00:30:22,619
Me, too.

682
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:23,415
Well, these look like...

683
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:26,182
really boring building plans.

684
00:30:26,186 --> 00:30:27,200
Yeah, I thought
so, too,

685
00:30:27,234 --> 00:30:29,100
the first two hours
I stared at them,

686
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:31,800
but then I saw...

687
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:38,900
Oh.

688
00:30:38,933 --> 00:30:40,574
Nice work, babe.

689
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:42,684
Yeah, I'm totally
in the dark here.

690
00:30:42,685 --> 00:30:43,526
Well, they
put in these

691
00:30:43,527 --> 00:30:44,567
utility tunnels here.

692
00:30:44,601 --> 00:30:46,343
Yeah, but according
to these plans,

693
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:47,800
the room they lead
to is empty.

694
00:30:47,833 --> 00:30:50,685
So, if you wanted to,
say, move things in and out

695
00:30:50,686 --> 00:30:52,401
of the lab without opening
the front door...

696
00:30:52,402 --> 00:30:53,542
You'd go in here.

697
00:30:57,664 --> 00:30:58,512
Babe...

698
00:30:58,929 --> 00:30:59,733
this is good news.

699
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:01,194
Where's your happy face?

700
00:31:02,127 --> 00:31:04,300
Rossum is seriously
powerful, and this just...

701
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,845
this just became real.

702
00:31:06,694 --> 00:31:08,220
Well, it's always
been real to me.

703
00:31:09,253 --> 00:31:10,236
Caroline, I'm just saying

704
00:31:10,237 --> 00:31:11,400
you might not want
to piss them off.

705
00:31:11,434 --> 00:31:14,568
Rossum is exploiting animals
in the name of "science,"

706
00:31:14,569 --> 00:31:16,066
and God knows
what else.

707
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,567
I might want to
piss them off

708
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:19,100
a real lot.
Okay, okay.

709
00:31:19,719 --> 00:31:20,661
Go easy.

710
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:22,252
I'm not backing out.

711
00:31:22,253 --> 00:31:23,608
You'd better
not back out.

712
00:31:23,609 --> 00:31:24,379
I'm with you.

713
00:31:24,593 --> 00:31:25,519
Damn right.

714
00:31:25,554 --> 00:31:27,567
Always.

715
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:35,128
The entrance
is here somewhere.

716
00:31:35,129 --> 00:31:36,830
Okay, we're nowhere near
the Rossum Building,

717
00:31:36,831 --> 00:31:38,245
and I checked all
the directories

718
00:31:38,246 --> 00:31:38,833
for all these
buildings,

719
00:31:38,866 --> 00:31:40,467
and still no
Lily Foundry.

720
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:43,017
Because you're standing on her.

721
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:49,100
There.

722
00:31:49,133 --> 00:31:51,434
We... we follow
the red pipe.

723
00:31:51,902 --> 00:31:53,690
I've been here before,

724
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:55,123
but how can you
not remember something

725
00:31:55,124 --> 00:31:56,590
and remember it
at the same time?

726
00:31:56,591 --> 00:31:58,663
That's just the drug
making you act weird.

727
00:31:58,664 --> 00:32:00,000
No.

728
00:32:00,033 --> 00:32:01,133
I felt it before.

729
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:03,800
It pulled me here.

730
00:32:04,653 --> 00:32:06,205
Well, maybe
you're crazy.

731
00:32:07,549 --> 00:32:08,601
Do you think so?

732
00:32:08,634 --> 00:32:10,477
What I do think is,
when we get in there,

733
00:32:10,478 --> 00:32:12,334
we have to look for lab books,

734
00:32:12,367 --> 00:32:13,534
uh, logs, chemical samples,

735
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:16,334
proof that Rossum
is responsible for this mess.

736
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:18,267
Right there.

737
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:20,531
That goes straight
into the Rossum Building.

738
00:32:20,532 --> 00:32:21,315
Yeah.

739
00:32:26,204 --> 00:32:28,865
Okay, we're gonna have to move
like ninjas from here on out.

740
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:30,900
We're not gonna have
to fight, are we?

741
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:33,509
Because I don't even really
know how to make a fist.

742
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,234
Not if we do
this right.

743
00:32:40,245 --> 00:32:42,517
Okay, so the staircase
to the lab

744
00:32:42,518 --> 00:32:43,634
is just beyond
the lobby.

745
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,234
Now, timing is
everything.

746
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:46,900
Just pretend like we're
playing a video game,

747
00:32:46,933 --> 00:32:47,933
and I'm gonna go first.

748
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,167
And when he turns
his back,

749
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,900
then you go.

750
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:53,167
I don't play video games.

751
00:32:56,866 --> 00:32:58,434
You.

752
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,667
I am so sorry

753
00:33:00,701 --> 00:33:02,534
that I tried to kill you.

754
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,067
It's okay.

755
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,172
No, it's not okay.

756
00:33:08,173 --> 00:33:08,900
I tried to burn you to death.

757
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:09,833
Who does that?

758
00:33:09,866 --> 00:33:11,866
What's the holdup? He says

759
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,367
he tried to
kill me.

760
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,967
He's been exposed.

761
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,434
Oh.

762
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:18,866
Um... it's okay.

763
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,900
Really, uh, whatever
you think you did,

764
00:33:20,933 --> 00:33:21,900
I'm over it.

765
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,300
You know, uh... water...

766
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:24,800
bridge... under.

767
00:33:24,833 --> 00:33:26,427
Please, I'm begging you,
don't walk away.

768
00:33:26,428 --> 00:33:28,173
I just... I need
your forgiveness.

769
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,170
You got it.

770
00:33:29,171 --> 00:33:29,833
You don't mean it.

771
00:33:29,866 --> 00:33:30,833
You still hate me.

772
00:33:30,866 --> 00:33:32,234
I could see it
in your eyes, right,

773
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:33,967
and you just keep looking
at me with them.

774
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
I mean it.

775
00:33:35,816 --> 00:33:36,727
I forgive you.

776
00:33:36,728 --> 00:33:38,634
Look, the guns, right,

777
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,900
the running around,
the barking orders.

778
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:43,133
This is not all there is
to Lawrence Dominic.

779
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:45,038
No, ma'am, this is just my job.

780
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,082
I'm not just hard edges.

781
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:47,400
I mean, look at me.

782
00:33:47,434 --> 00:33:48,634
Check this suit out.

783
00:33:48,667 --> 00:33:50,567
I'm not
just hard edges.

784
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:52,701
How many times
have I told you?

785
00:33:52,733 --> 00:33:54,634
He's not a nice doggie.

786
00:33:54,667 --> 00:33:56,400
I don't want
to pet him.

787
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,133
Mr. Dominic?

788
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:01,200
Mr. Dominic.

789
00:34:01,851 --> 00:34:04,624
I, uh, hear you're feeling
a little under the weather.

790
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,179
I think I might have
something that might help.

791
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,933
He's not
a nice doggie.

792
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,434
I don't want to pet him.

793
00:34:10,467 --> 00:34:11,500
He'll attack me.

794
00:34:25,766 --> 00:34:27,567
All right.

795
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:30,900
Everybody with a firearm,
turn it in, now.

796
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,601
Right here!

797
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,090
Let's get our
friend sedated.

798
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:56,367
You remember to be very quiet
during the game, right?

799
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:59,267
Noise is upsetting.

800
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,733
Lift up your dress.

801
00:35:05,833 --> 00:35:07,300
Stay away from me.

802
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:08,800
No, it's okay, it's okay.

803
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:09,833
I'm not gonna hurt you.

804
00:35:09,866 --> 00:35:10,967
We got to move now.

805
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,833
Let's go... please.

806
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:18,701
It's not...

807
00:35:18,766 --> 00:35:20,300
a fun game.

808
00:35:20,334 --> 00:35:23,334
Please, stop.

809
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,234
<i>We got to move now.</i>

810
00:35:26,267 --> 00:35:27,933
Please, wait.

811
00:35:29,053 --> 00:35:29,701
Listen, wait!

812
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Soft.

813
00:35:38,833 --> 00:35:41,200
Like a kitty. Mm...

814
00:35:43,733 --> 00:35:45,367
I don't hear
anything.

815
00:35:47,467 --> 00:35:49,490
She didn't finish
the trigger code.

816
00:35:49,491 --> 00:35:50,842
She's probably right as rain.

817
00:35:50,843 --> 00:35:52,149
Go check.

818
00:35:52,334 --> 00:35:54,033
I am your superior!

819
00:35:54,495 --> 00:35:55,847
In every way.

820
00:35:57,152 --> 00:35:58,089
Go check.

821
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:07,557
He dumped the stock.

822
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:10,924
He ran out of options.

823
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,073
Help me get her
into the chair.

824
00:36:14,434 --> 00:36:16,267
I can't deal.

825
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:19,601
Help me get her
into the chair.

826
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:35,033
You need to wipe this
out of her.

827
00:36:35,807 --> 00:36:36,900
It doesn't make any sense.

828
00:36:36,933 --> 00:36:38,933
Then you make
it make sense.

829
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,400
You think I float
around like a balloon,

830
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:45,167
untethered to
your muck?

831
00:36:45,539 --> 00:36:46,253
Flip.

832
00:36:48,287 --> 00:36:51,133
I run this house.

833
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,367
No, no.

834
00:36:52,757 --> 00:36:54,667
It doesn't make any sense.

835
00:36:54,701 --> 00:36:56,067
Except...

836
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,307
Actives' brains
aren't like ours.

837
00:36:58,308 --> 00:37:00,367
I mean, we alter them
this way and that,

838
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,534
so... N seven
three...

839
00:37:04,562 --> 00:37:05,813
blah, blah, blah...

840
00:37:07,164 --> 00:37:09,661
it hit the Actives later,
all right?

841
00:37:09,696 --> 00:37:11,248
And differently.

842
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,488
Like... a memory glitch.

843
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:15,398
Which means...

844
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,234
the compound
is breaking down

845
00:37:18,267 --> 00:37:19,933
into a protease

846
00:37:19,967 --> 00:37:23,634
and zipping right through
our manmade memory blocks.

847
00:37:24,405 --> 00:37:26,115
November glitched
to a traumatic memory.

848
00:37:26,231 --> 00:37:27,623
I bet the same thing
is happening

849
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:28,613
to the other Dolls.

850
00:37:29,744 --> 00:37:31,933
Upside is the drug's devolving.

851
00:37:32,636 --> 00:37:34,202
A couple hours, it will be gone.

852
00:37:34,205 --> 00:37:35,567
How do you explain the man

853
00:37:35,601 --> 00:37:37,400
who lost his brain
down his shirt?

854
00:37:37,434 --> 00:37:39,733
Had an extreme dose.

855
00:37:40,412 --> 00:37:41,733
Way more than you can absorb.

856
00:37:41,766 --> 00:37:43,614
Way more than...

857
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:47,067
...he would have taken.

858
00:37:53,904 --> 00:37:54,975
It's a murder.

859
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,141
It's different.

860
00:38:10,234 --> 00:38:12,342
Yeah? What did it used
to be like?

861
00:38:13,003 --> 00:38:13,778
I don't know.

862
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:25,780
Right where I left it.

863
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:31,667
I have to stop him.

864
00:38:35,766 --> 00:38:37,900
Who?

865
00:38:40,086 --> 00:38:41,176
Something awful.

866
00:38:57,866 --> 00:38:59,467
Is that the drug?

867
00:39:00,181 --> 00:39:01,107
You found it.

868
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,498
You found it really fast.

869
00:39:12,232 --> 00:39:13,133
Sam?

870
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:15,500
Oh...

871
00:39:15,534 --> 00:39:17,933
I'm sorry. Look,
I'm-I'm really sorry.

872
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:20,100
I'm sorry.

873
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:34,841
We're in.

874
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:40,962
Leo, over here.

875
00:39:49,567 --> 00:39:51,047
What do they need babies for?

876
00:39:51,414 --> 00:39:52,679
This is Rossum.

877
00:39:53,590 --> 00:39:55,063
They don't care about souls.

878
00:39:55,464 --> 00:39:56,940
Human or animal.

879
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,524
What are they
doing to you?

880
00:40:05,997 --> 00:40:07,282
Are you getting this?

881
00:40:14,138 --> 00:40:14,848
Babe?

882
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:17,298
You got to see something.

883
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:21,408
What is it?

884
00:40:25,594 --> 00:40:26,756
Science fiction?

885
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:30,464
They're not just experimenting
with animals.

886
00:40:30,578 --> 00:40:32,500
Babe, we got
to get footage of...

887
00:40:38,078 --> 00:40:38,989
Are they...?

888
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:42,961
What the hell
are they doing?

889
00:40:43,147 --> 00:40:44,442
Something really not good.

890
00:40:45,698 --> 00:40:47,604
I told you Rossum was evil.

891
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:50,742
Here. Take this.
You get the animals.

892
00:40:50,743 --> 00:40:52,230
I'm gonna see what I
can find in here. Yeah.

893
00:40:55,248 --> 00:40:56,428
Look at her.

894
00:40:57,336 --> 00:40:58,904
Do we have
to just leave her here?

895
00:40:59,147 --> 00:41:00,055
Babe, it's not a pet shop.

896
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:01,265
We can't take them with us.

897
00:41:02,695 --> 00:41:04,112
Hey! Don't move!

898
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:05,870
Go! Run!

899
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,880
<i>What...</i>

900
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,044
did you do?

901
00:41:13,147 --> 00:41:13,773
Make it stop.

902
00:41:13,774 --> 00:41:14,648
Please.

903
00:41:15,828 --> 00:41:17,524
I'm sorry about
this, okay?

904
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:19,473
I- I didn't want to
do this, any of this.

905
00:41:20,082 --> 00:41:22,009
All these people-
why did you hurt them?

906
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:24,392
This right here is my chance
for something.

907
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,702
Owen and me were gonna
take this over to Bel Med Tec.

908
00:41:27,703 --> 00:41:28,943
In Switzerland?

909
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,467
It's the number two drug company
in the world right after Rossum.

910
00:41:31,468 --> 00:41:33,279
You know what they'd pay
for this?

911
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:35,493
Billions.

912
00:41:36,141 --> 00:41:37,057
You're insane.

913
00:41:37,058 --> 00:41:38,331
Nobody's perfect.

914
00:41:40,346 --> 00:41:41,557
You do love a fight.

915
00:41:42,606 --> 00:41:43,467
So we're going?

916
00:41:47,244 --> 00:41:48,719
You're a killer.

917
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:54,081
Listen, Owen was my best friend.

918
00:41:54,736 --> 00:41:56,247
And him dying-
I didn't want that.

919
00:41:56,248 --> 00:41:58,071
I just wanted to get
him out of the way

920
00:41:58,072 --> 00:41:59,595
long enough for me
to get out of town.

921
00:41:59,806 --> 00:42:01,647
I didn't know he'd hurt himself
like that, okay?

922
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,665
He knew
what you were going to do.

923
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:04,878
It was his idea.

924
00:42:05,742 --> 00:42:08,500
And then he got scared,
said Rossum would come after us.

925
00:42:08,501 --> 00:42:09,171
He tried to stop me.

926
00:42:09,172 --> 00:42:10,444
Just because you didn't mean it

927
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:11,909
doesn't mean
you didn't kill him.

928
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:14,297
You're responsible.

929
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:18,015
You think about it your way,
and I'll think about it mine.

930
00:42:19,231 --> 00:42:20,338
Enjoy your trip.

931
00:42:21,325 --> 00:42:21,933
No.

932
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,316
Here...

933
00:42:41,351 --> 00:42:42,611
Leave it! Leave it!

934
00:42:42,612 --> 00:42:43,009
No!

935
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,390
Leave it!
Go!

936
00:42:48,698 --> 00:42:49,433
No!

937
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:54,876
You're a killer, Sam.

938
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,942
You killed him!

939
00:43:04,176 --> 00:43:06,320
I love you,
and you're gonna be okay.

940
00:43:06,605 --> 00:43:08,932
Oh, my God. Come on, we
have to get out of here. Shh!

941
00:43:12,026 --> 00:43:13,793
Okay, okay.

942
00:43:14,933 --> 00:43:17,168
Leo, come on...

943
00:43:23,929 --> 00:43:27,792
Oh, hey, again, so sorry
about the burning alive thing.

944
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,366
Ooh!

945
00:43:36,874 --> 00:43:37,612
Stay with me.

946
00:43:37,613 --> 00:43:38,798
I need you!

947
00:43:38,799 --> 00:43:39,661
Leo, please!

948
00:43:40,783 --> 00:43:41,708
I'm your girl.

949
00:43:42,191 --> 00:43:43,068
Leo.

950
00:43:43,617 --> 00:43:44,615
Please, Leo!

951
00:43:45,082 --> 00:43:46,722
Leo, stay!
Please stay!

952
00:43:46,723 --> 00:43:48,379
Get off of me,
you crazy bitch!

953
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:55,075
Echo?
Mm?

954
00:43:57,750 --> 00:43:59,021
Would you like a treatment?

955
00:44:03,202 --> 00:44:04,186
Yes.

956
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,071
Ms. DeWitt,
I'm glad you could come.

957
00:44:29,392 --> 00:44:32,069
You seemed quite confident
she fits the profile.

958
00:44:32,492 --> 00:44:34,972
Yes. She's been
through a lot.

959
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:37,333
Well, you were
right to call.

960
00:44:55,554 --> 00:44:56,823
She was just here.

961
00:44:57,935 --> 00:44:59,316
She won't get far.

962
00:45:05,707 --> 00:45:07,063
Mr. Dominic,
please come in.

963
00:45:07,064 --> 00:45:07,817
Thank you.

964
00:45:19,059 --> 00:45:20,590
Would you like a drink?

965
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,553
No, thank you.

966
00:45:23,270 --> 00:45:23,760
yeah

967
00:45:24,307 --> 00:45:27,040
All the Actives have been
evaluated and processed.

968
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:29,153
Everything seems satisfactory.

969
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:32,989
Wonderful news.

970
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,900
Yours, I believe.

971
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:47,809
Yes.

972
00:45:48,784 --> 00:45:49,610
Uh, thank you.

973
00:45:54,766 --> 00:45:55,622
The, uh, press

974
00:45:55,623 --> 00:45:57,131
is running
with the story we sold them.

975
00:45:58,334 --> 00:46:00,750
"Student drugs classmates
before committing suicide. "

976
00:46:00,751 --> 00:46:01,916
And Echo?

977
00:46:03,086 --> 00:46:05,691
I suppose you'll be recommending
she be sent to the Attic.

978
00:46:06,106 --> 00:46:07,861
That's entirely your call,
ma'am.

979
00:46:07,862 --> 00:46:09,231
For God's sakes,
quit calling me ma'am.

980
00:46:09,232 --> 00:46:10,979
We got drugged.

981
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:13,278
We behaved like idiot children.

982
00:46:13,279 --> 00:46:14,975
It happens. It's over.

983
00:46:17,583 --> 00:46:18,590
You may go.

984
00:47:00,466 --> 00:47:01,730
Were you gonna
say anything?

985
00:47:03,257 --> 00:47:04,489
I just need to get away.

986
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:07,800
It's not forever.

987
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:09,967
I get it.

988
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,967
I'm sorry.

989
00:47:12,735 --> 00:47:15,329
Debbie might crash here
sometimes, if you hear a noise.

990
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:17,554
If you need to reach me...

991
00:47:17,555 --> 00:47:18,248
You know what?

992
00:47:19,901 --> 00:47:21,602
Maybe it's better
if I don't know where you are.

993
00:47:23,367 --> 00:47:24,439
In case.

994
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:27,044
Yeah. Okay.

995
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:29,503
Okay.

996
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:32,151
Mellie?

997
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:35,584
You know where I am.

998
00:47:51,334 --> 00:47:53,281
This should help you relax.

999
00:47:55,434 --> 00:47:57,566
Well, I don't want to relax.

1000
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,466
I want the hell out of here.

1001
00:47:59,499 --> 00:48:00,354
I understand.

1002
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:01,332
You can't hold me.

1003
00:48:01,333 --> 00:48:03,175
You have to have cause,
evidence.

1004
00:48:03,176 --> 00:48:05,037
I'm not with the government.

1005
00:48:07,373 --> 00:48:08,306
Well, then who the hell are you?

1006
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:14,070
I'm someone who can
give you what you want.

1007
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:16,619
And what do I want?

1008
00:48:16,756 --> 00:48:17,942
A new life.

1009
00:48:18,633 --> 00:48:19,738
A better life.

1010
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:23,500
Your mother,

1011
00:48:23,501 --> 00:48:26,282
Antoinette Jennings
of 483 Hellena Street.

1012
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:30,085
I understand she's experiencing
some financial difficulties.

1013
00:48:30,086 --> 00:48:31,883
In fact, she's about
to lose her home.

1014
00:48:31,884 --> 00:48:33,991
Do not threaten my mother.

1015
00:48:34,501 --> 00:48:35,661
Quite the opposite.

1016
00:48:36,338 --> 00:48:37,651
Once you sign these papers,

1017
00:48:38,063 --> 00:48:40,386
your mother will begin
receiving a monthly stipend

1018
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:42,521
large enough to solve
her financial problems.

1019
00:48:43,973 --> 00:48:46,425
It will continue
for five years,

1020
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:47,947
and at the end
of that time,

1021
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:50,287
you will be quite capable

1022
00:48:50,466 --> 00:48:52,434
of supporting her

1023
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:54,466
all on your own.

1024
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:56,702
How?

1025
00:48:58,859 --> 00:49:00,398
I'm going to make you an offer.

1026
00:49:00,741 --> 00:49:05,741
