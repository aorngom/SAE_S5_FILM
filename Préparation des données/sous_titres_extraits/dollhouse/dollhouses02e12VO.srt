00:00:00,084 --> 00:00:01,083
<i>Previously...</i>

2
00:00:01,892 --> 00:00:03,794
So long as Clyde's
partner is out there,

3
00:00:03,963 --> 00:00:05,363
Rossum will go on.

4
00:00:05,675 --> 00:00:07,298
We have to cut
the head off the snake.

5
00:00:07,683 --> 00:00:09,967
And Caroline's the only one
who's ever met that snake.

6
00:00:10,235 --> 00:00:12,011
- Where's the wedge?
- Gone.

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,346
Caroline's missing.

8
00:00:14,657 --> 00:00:16,644
- Saunders did this.
- Rossum got to her.

9
00:00:16,769 --> 00:00:17,600
A sleeper.

10
00:00:17,874 --> 00:00:20,311
Do you recall
your former neighbor Mellie?

11
00:00:21,035 --> 00:00:23,397
You insist she come along,
I insist she be someone

12
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,982
who trusts you entirely.

13
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:27,401
We're about to go to war.
Go, be with each other,

14
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,028
even if it's just for the night.

15
00:00:29,273 --> 00:00:31,307
Any good battle plan must be fluid.

16
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,115
We'll be going
into full lockdown mode.

17
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,202
Where is security?

18
00:00:37,774 --> 00:00:38,713
Why me?

19
00:00:38,838 --> 00:00:40,738
Because you're very special.

20
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:43,417
You're going to help us
in ways you can't understand.

21
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,086
And I'm just gonna trust you?

22
00:00:45,589 --> 00:00:46,754
With your life.

23
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:49,338


24
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,843
I know what you're doing here.

25
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:55,854
I know all about Rossum's
sick experiments.

26
00:00:55,979 --> 00:00:56,972
So I gather.

27
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:58,808
You're quite the supersleuth.

28
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,143
You can't do anything to me.

29
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,655
People will find out.

30
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,480
People... will find out?

31
00:01:05,195 --> 00:01:06,649
Caroline, don't be silly.

32
00:01:06,817 --> 00:01:08,953
We both know you could vanish
off the face of the earth,

33
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:11,529
and not a soul would notice
you were gone.

34
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:16,590
Did you know that Rossum is the world
leader in producing MRI machines?

35
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:18,715
Congratulations.

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,840
Who cares?

37
00:01:20,097 --> 00:01:23,411
We're also on the cutting edge
of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's research.

38
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:26,037
Developing the newest
atomic force microscopes.

39
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,481
We have clinical laboratories
in every major city in the world.

40
00:01:30,711 --> 00:01:32,733
You know, like,
if you've had your blood drawn

41
00:01:32,858 --> 00:01:34,852
to see if you're a suitable
bone marrow donor

42
00:01:34,977 --> 00:01:36,553
for your cousin who has leukemia.

43
00:01:37,664 --> 00:01:39,764
Rossum likely tested that blood.

44
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:42,756
What did you say?

45
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,611
We like to keep the medical records
of everyone who crosses our path,

46
00:01:45,736 --> 00:01:47,448
especially the interesting ones.

47
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:51,235
You are definitely interesting.
At least on a microscopic level.

48
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,112
What the hell do you want from me?

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,156
- Just a few years of your life.
- No way.

50
00:01:55,913 --> 00:01:57,366
You're gonna have to kill me.

51
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,659
I won't need to.

52
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,619
You've committed terrorist acts.

53
00:02:01,226 --> 00:02:04,339
At best, you're looking
at a lifetime in a federal prison.

54
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:07,623
That's if they don't stick
a needle in your arm.

55
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:10,508
Adelle DeWitt is downstairs.

56
00:02:10,834 --> 00:02:12,965
- She's going to make you an offer.
- To what?

57
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:15,533
Let you brainwash me?
Not a chance.

58
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:19,054
Believe me when I tell you,
Caroline, this is your only chance.

59
00:02:20,649 --> 00:02:21,849
You are special.

60
00:02:22,923 --> 00:02:24,773
You have amazing potential.

61
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,464
I want to see exactly
how far you can go.

62
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:30,389
And I promise you,

63
00:02:31,362 --> 00:02:32,812
I will protect you.

64
00:02:35,119 --> 00:02:37,155
How do I know I can believe you?

65
00:02:37,802 --> 00:02:39,152
It's like I said.

66
00:02:40,679 --> 00:02:42,429
You'll learn to trust me.

67
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:45,875


68
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,880
I don't want to go back.

69
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,839
I just found you.
The idea of letting you go...

70
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,516
We can walk right out
of this building.

71
00:03:03,735 --> 00:03:06,685
Find a doctor to rip out the crap
they put in our heads, never look back.

72
00:03:08,558 --> 00:03:10,309
I couldn't live with myself.

73
00:03:10,434 --> 00:03:11,816
Neither could you.

74
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,864
Actually, no,
I could definitely get over it.

75
00:03:19,488 --> 00:03:20,538
Here we go.

76
00:03:56,153 --> 00:03:58,153
Looks like the war
started without us.

77
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,489
Episode 212: <i>The Hollow Men</i>

78
00:04:26,402 --> 00:04:28,363
www.subbercafe.fr

79
00:04:37,912 --> 00:04:40,654
Phones are dead. Rossum won't be able
to find us that way.

80
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,614
Chopper should be here any second.

81
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:45,576
- We can't wait for them much longer.
- We can wait.

82
00:04:54,382 --> 00:04:56,420
- How's the neck?
- A little sore.

83
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:59,832
- I think the bleeding stopped.
- Wasn't exactly a surgical procedure.

84
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:01,907
- Sorry about that.
- I'm not.

85
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:04,136
Thought of them being able
to track me wherever I go...

86
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:06,720
I'm just glad it's out.

87
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:12,011
Sorry.

88
00:05:12,306 --> 00:05:13,306
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:14,388 --> 00:05:16,922
They said the way I feel
about you is just a program.

90
00:05:17,047 --> 00:05:18,359
I'm trying to remember that.

91
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,527
It's okay.

92
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:23,739
I'm glad we're together,
no matter what happens.

93
00:05:24,953 --> 00:05:26,663
Look lively.
Someone's coming.

94
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:29,495
- Is that them?
- Or Rossum found us.

95
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,790
Let's be prepared for
either eventuality.

96
00:05:39,268 --> 00:05:40,047
It's us.

97
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:41,793
Where's Echo?

98
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,175
I need help.

99
00:05:46,018 --> 00:05:47,846
It's on fire!
It's burning me!

100
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,723
- What's wrong with her?
- I don't know.

101
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,225
- What happened?
- Attacked.

102
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,746
- They're coming.
- You're okay. You're not burning.

103
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,617
- Hold her.
- It hurts...

104
00:05:58,978 --> 00:06:00,192
How did this happened?

105
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,400
- Why is she like this?
- Doesn't make any sense.

106
00:06:02,525 --> 00:06:04,776
I imprinted her as Caroline.
I ate the butt of a rifle.

107
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:06,365
I wake up, and she's mental.

108
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:09,356
- The wedge must have been too damaged.
- No. Bennett fixed the wedge.

109
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:10,577
She died fixing it.

110
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,111
Then maybe Echo and Caroline
are not getting along.

111
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:15,124
We need to reevaluate
the game plan here.

112
00:06:16,162 --> 00:06:18,070
- Nothing's changed.
- Boyd, you got shot.

113
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:20,337
I've been shot before
and I've got meds.

114
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,301
We have to get to Tucson,
break into Rossum

115
00:06:22,426 --> 00:06:23,799
and destroy that mainframe.

116
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,717
Impossible. Caroline was the only one
who could get us in the building.

117
00:06:26,842 --> 00:06:29,218
She's the only one who could
identify Rossum's founder.

118
00:06:29,343 --> 00:06:30,681
Without her, we're screwed.

119
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,684
If we don't try, everything Echo's done
and become will be for nothing.

120
00:06:34,345 --> 00:06:37,521
- It's up to us to finish this.
- How do we even get inside, Boyd?

121
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:42,026
We walk in through the front door.
There's no need to sneak around.

122
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:45,209
We have something Rossum wants.

123
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,120
Come on.

124
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:13,488
They got the hard drives.

125
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,237
No security footage.

126
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:19,253
They knew exactly what they were doing,
exactly how to cover their tracks.

127
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:22,398
How do you feel
about getting the hell out of here?

128
00:07:31,627 --> 00:07:33,827
- Look at this.
- Must be some kind of program.

129
00:07:34,544 --> 00:07:35,734
No, not a program.

130
00:07:35,859 --> 00:07:38,457
A person, this chair,
it changes you into someone else.

131
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,292
It could tell us what happened.

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,836
No. We said we wouldn't do this.
No more technology.

133
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,654
- But this could help us.
- Or kill us.

134
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,631
We don't know who
left that note there.

135
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,234
I don't want to lose you again.

136
00:07:49,798 --> 00:07:50,594
Oh, babe.

137
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:54,330
Look, you said it yourself.
We have to help our friends.

138
00:07:54,455 --> 00:07:56,391
And this chair right here
might be our only shot.

139
00:07:57,285 --> 00:07:58,393
And you know,

140
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,830
no matter who I am,
no matter what they put in my skull,

141
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:02,481
I always remember you.

142
00:08:03,175 --> 00:08:04,575
That won't change.

143
00:08:05,635 --> 00:08:07,185
But if I turn evil...

144
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,029
Shoot me.

145
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,531
I'm not gonna kill you.

146
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,616
Well, seriously wound me, then.

147
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,748
Just, you know,
try to stay away from the junk.

148
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:28,675
Do it.

149
00:08:48,515 --> 00:08:49,515
Oh, God.

150
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:54,783
Take it... Take it easy!

151
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:57,202
Did it not work?

152
00:08:57,794 --> 00:08:59,394
Where did everyone go?

153
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:03,228
- Did they change their minds?
- Who are you?

154
00:09:07,341 --> 00:09:08,486
That is not good.

155
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,799
That's very bad.

156
00:09:13,165 --> 00:09:15,095
- What am I wearing?
- Tell me who you are!

157
00:09:15,925 --> 00:09:17,598
It's me... Topher.

158
00:09:18,075 --> 00:09:20,642
Geez, why are we arming the Dolls?

159
00:09:20,885 --> 00:09:22,895
I'm not a Doll. I'm Priya.

160
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:26,725
Interesting. So, you're...

161
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:28,165
You're you.

162
00:09:29,725 --> 00:09:31,325
So, the question is...

163
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:32,855
Where am I?

164
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,782
You don't know what happened here?

165
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:36,950
Oh, God.

166
00:09:40,595 --> 00:09:41,595
Am I dead?

167
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,209
{\ROSSUM HEADQUARTERS
Tuscon, Arizona}

168
00:09:49,115 --> 00:09:51,131
You're gonna want to come down here.

169
00:09:51,405 --> 00:09:53,258
- Good morning.
- Can we help you?

170
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,552
I doubt it.
I'm looking for the man in charge.

171
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,222
- And you are...?
- Adelle DeWitt.

172
00:09:59,575 --> 00:10:02,476
We haven't met,
but I've heard all about you.

173
00:10:03,155 --> 00:10:05,312
- She killed Bennett.
- She's not Claire.

174
00:10:05,505 --> 00:10:06,555
He's quick.

175
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:07,731
Very quick.

176
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,068
- What did you do with her?
- I guess I just sort of evicted her.

177
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:14,071
Tossed her out
on the digital street, as it were.

178
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:16,239
I'm not big on sentimentality.

179
00:10:17,065 --> 00:10:18,415
And you, my dear.

180
00:10:18,995 --> 00:10:20,619
So excited to see you again.

181
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,623
You never know how these types
of experiments are gonna work out.

182
00:10:25,545 --> 00:10:27,245
I am a lucky boy.

183
00:10:27,794 --> 00:10:29,594
Right here at my doorstep.

184
00:10:30,085 --> 00:10:32,198
All you're missing
is the little bow.

185
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:34,716
- Who the hell are you?
- Clyde Randolph.

186
00:10:35,695 --> 00:10:37,135
Cofounder of Rossum.

187
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,137
I thought Clyde
was stuck in the Attic.

188
00:10:39,572 --> 00:10:40,472
Not anymore.

189
00:10:41,235 --> 00:10:43,835
My original got himself
caught in a loop.

190
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,810
This world is for people
who can evolve.

191
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:49,022
And does that include us?

192
00:10:50,975 --> 00:10:53,402
Isn't that what you're here
to find out?

193
00:10:56,935 --> 00:10:58,285
This is terrible.

194
00:11:00,555 --> 00:11:01,827
I want my body back.

195
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,246
It was a nice body. I mean,

196
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,695
I cover it up half the time
with plaid and cotton-poly blends,

197
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:10,168
but I took pride in my physique.

198
00:11:10,615 --> 00:11:12,296
I had a physique, do you understand?

199
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,310
I mean, this body's okay and everything,
but, I mean, still...

200
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:18,635
We don't know you're dead.
We don't know whose blood that is.

201
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,103
- Then where am I, Sierra?
- Priya.

202
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:24,397
Is that really the most important issue
right now?

203
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,782
Who else would have left
the Topher wedge behind?

204
00:11:26,907 --> 00:11:29,187
I mean, how could you have done that
if you were dead?

205
00:11:30,985 --> 00:11:32,816
You have a point.
You have a point.

206
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:35,055
Right.

207
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,687
Right, right.
Why would I leave a backup wedge?

208
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:42,145
Still thinking.

209
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,494
Well, something only Topher
would know.

210
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:48,165
Yeah, frankly 90% of the things
in my head, no one else knows.

211
00:11:48,645 --> 00:11:51,570
It would help to get caught up
on the state of things here.

212
00:11:51,695 --> 00:11:54,028
I mean, for example,
who are the dead dudes?

213
00:11:54,425 --> 00:11:56,625
Hit men from Rossum, I'm guessing.

214
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,926
We're at war with
the Rossum Corporation, by the way.

215
00:12:00,878 --> 00:12:01,678
Fine.

216
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:02,846
So...

217
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,806
Who killed them?

218
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,824
We don't know.
The security footage was taken.

219
00:12:10,715 --> 00:12:11,965
Shut up!

220
00:12:14,715 --> 00:12:17,865
I had a camera installed.
No one else knew about it.

221
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,070
See?

222
00:12:19,195 --> 00:12:20,680
I was trying to catch a thief.

223
00:12:20,805 --> 00:12:23,823
I'm pretty sure Ivy's been stealing

224
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:25,775
my turkey jerkies.

225
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:38,695
Here's the last thing it recorded.

226
00:12:42,005 --> 00:12:43,205
What was that?

227
00:12:43,695 --> 00:12:45,295
What's wrong with her?

228
00:12:46,965 --> 00:12:48,665
Back it up.
Back it up.

229
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:55,440
He threw something away.

230
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,545
What's this?

231
00:13:02,155 --> 00:13:03,705
Looks like a syringe.

232
00:13:05,954 --> 00:13:07,940
I don't understand.
He drugged Echo.

233
00:13:08,065 --> 00:13:09,715
Why would he drug Echo?

234
00:13:11,495 --> 00:13:13,508
Not Echo. Caroline.

235
00:13:13,633 --> 00:13:16,044
She was gonna tell us
who the founder of Rossum is.

236
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:19,131
Boyd's working for Rossum.

237
00:13:20,345 --> 00:13:21,695
You know, Adelle,

238
00:13:22,645 --> 00:13:23,802
I have to thank you.

239
00:13:24,315 --> 00:13:27,115
None of this could have happened
without you.

240
00:13:27,285 --> 00:13:28,854
It's an exciting time,

241
00:13:28,979 --> 00:13:31,679
and you have been
a good little worker bee.

242
00:13:32,245 --> 00:13:34,271
I'm happy to be of service,
Mr. Randolph.

243
00:13:34,575 --> 00:13:37,740
Though honestly, I'm not sure
I'm deserving of such high praise.

244
00:13:37,865 --> 00:13:38,865
What?

245
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:41,805
Above anything,
Caroline is your success.

246
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,520
You nurtured her,
fostered her growth.

247
00:13:44,645 --> 00:13:46,825
Guided her to become
what she is now.

248
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,160
And what is that?

249
00:13:48,885 --> 00:13:49,744
Our savior.

250
00:13:50,755 --> 00:13:52,438
Caroline's going to save the world?

251
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,910
Not the world.

252
00:13:54,035 --> 00:13:55,292
Just the deserving few.

253
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,100
You'll be happy to know,
you'll be counted among them.

254
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:01,194
Unfortunately, in her present state,

255
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:03,519
Caroline isn't fit to save anyone.

256
00:14:04,275 --> 00:14:07,375
I'm afraid we scrambled her head
one time too many.

257
00:14:07,655 --> 00:14:10,056
The mind doesn't matter.
It's the body we want.

258
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:20,435
He always knew you'd be the one
to deliver her to us.

259
00:14:21,445 --> 00:14:23,069
Our mysterious founder.

260
00:14:25,935 --> 00:14:28,585
I'd like to thank him
for his faith in me.

261
00:14:29,275 --> 00:14:31,975
I know he's looking forward
to that moment.

262
00:14:43,065 --> 00:14:45,383
Do you think they're going
to let us out of here?

263
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,177
You'll be okay.
We'll find a way.

264
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:50,972
You don't want to do that.
That's just gonna loop back on you.

265
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:52,290
What?

266
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,965
Stop breathing on me.

267
00:14:55,815 --> 00:14:57,465
Why did they take Echo?

268
00:14:58,855 --> 00:14:59,856
I don't know.

269
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,486
- Got it.
- You did that?

270
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:06,805
You did that!

271
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:09,199
They must have a weapons cache
in this building. Find it.

272
00:15:09,665 --> 00:15:11,076
I'll take Topher with me.

273
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:13,245
I need him.
We're gonna go after Caroline.

274
00:15:13,535 --> 00:15:15,914
Be careful. They'll kill us all
if they get a chance.

275
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:17,815
Good luck.

276
00:15:19,872 --> 00:15:21,185
We've been betrayed!

277
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,970
By my best man friend.

278
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,447
Soft spoken, mild-mannered,
benedict Boyd.

279
00:15:26,935 --> 00:15:30,060
Although, I got to admit,
I'm kinda of impressed.

280
00:15:30,185 --> 00:15:31,429
Why can't I find Mellie?

281
00:15:32,811 --> 00:15:34,256
Chip's deactivated.

282
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:36,768
I mean, that dude can act.

283
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,189
I don't know whether I want
to kill him or get his autograph.

284
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,513
We have to go!

285
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:41,856
We have to help them!

286
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,526
Hold on, cowgirl.
How do you plan on doing that?

287
00:15:44,748 --> 00:15:46,736
If you haven't noticed,
Rossum sort of has ways

288
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:49,322
of doing, well, this a lot!

289
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:52,367
I don't care. I can't just sit here.
We have to fight.

290
00:15:52,558 --> 00:15:54,497
That is so Ripley of you
and it's supersexy,

291
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,746
but can I make a suggestion?

292
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:58,811
Anthony.

293
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:00,500
He's a soldier, right?

294
00:16:01,037 --> 00:16:02,910
I will sacrifice my personhood

295
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:05,109
and give you back your boyfriend...

296
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:06,339
and then some.

297
00:16:07,352 --> 00:16:09,217
- And then some what?
- Enhancements.

298
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:10,310
Mad skills.

299
00:16:10,435 --> 00:16:12,554
Ninja, hacking, combat training.

300
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:15,310
Cooking?
Doesn't seem that important now,

301
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:18,125
but if you two end up getting married,
you'll thank me.

302
00:16:18,654 --> 00:16:19,591
If, if.

303
00:16:20,636 --> 00:16:21,771
I could do you, too.

304
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,560
No more imprints.
Not for Anthony. Not for me.

305
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,652
Look, I get it.
I get it.

306
00:16:28,309 --> 00:16:31,406
The tech is responsible
for all of this.

307
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,556
But in this particular instance,

308
00:16:33,914 --> 00:16:36,161
why not give the good guys
a fighting chance?

309
00:16:55,531 --> 00:16:58,141
- Looks like they cleared the place out.
- I want to tell you something.

310
00:16:58,567 --> 00:16:59,966
Something important.

311
00:17:04,331 --> 00:17:07,308
Whatever happened to her,
it wasn't a bad wedge.

312
00:17:07,433 --> 00:17:08,943
Bennett fixed it. I saw it.

313
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:11,994
And anyway,
if the wedge wasn't fixed,

314
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,199
it wouldn't make Echo
lose her marbles like that.

315
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,773
This is something else.

316
00:17:15,898 --> 00:17:17,234
What do you think it is?

317
00:17:17,993 --> 00:17:20,181
I don't have proof,
but I'll tell you what it feels like.

318
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:23,083
It's eerily similar to Sierra
when Nolan drugged her.

319
00:17:23,969 --> 00:17:25,494
You think someone drugged Echo?

320
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:26,558
How?

321
00:17:26,767 --> 00:17:28,463
It had to be someone
in the Dollhouse.

322
00:17:28,764 --> 00:17:31,297
I don't know who. Yet.
But I'm working on it.

323
00:17:31,422 --> 00:17:33,760
I left a little helpful
something-something back at the ranch.

324
00:17:34,394 --> 00:17:35,720
What does that mean?

325
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,000
My backup wedge.
Topher 2.0.

326
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,425
I left it in the chair.

327
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,268
Hopefully Victor and Sierra
came back, fired it up,

328
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:45,292
and are on their way here
with reinforcements. Go team!

329
00:17:47,431 --> 00:17:48,817
Thank you for confiding in me.

330
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:51,236
Of course.
Bros before others who aren't bros.

331
00:17:55,412 --> 00:17:57,456
- D- level is clear.
- <i>Roger that.</i>

332
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:00,819
I need you to stay here.

333
00:18:00,944 --> 00:18:02,493
That guard has a firearm.

334
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:03,968
We could use one right now.

335
00:18:04,093 --> 00:18:06,256
I've done my part.
Go do yours.

336
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,011
How do you feel?

337
00:18:26,896 --> 00:18:28,109
I don't know.

338
00:18:30,648 --> 00:18:31,943
I don't feel any different.

339
00:18:33,143 --> 00:18:34,446
Maybe it didn't take.

340
00:18:43,657 --> 00:18:44,998
Well, that's different.

341
00:18:46,886 --> 00:18:48,334
I'm suddenly okay with this.

342
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:51,379
Looks like somebody from Tucson
knows we're here.

343
00:18:52,445 --> 00:18:54,590
What do you say
we take the fight to them?

344
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,544
- You'll learn to trust me.
- They experiment with animals.

345
00:19:10,669 --> 00:19:11,742
Did I fall asleep?

346
00:19:11,867 --> 00:19:14,527
- This isn't a nightmare.
- What do they need babies for?

347
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,215
I need you! Leo, please.

348
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,932
Don't leave me!

349
00:19:18,796 --> 00:19:20,658
This is the shape of things to come.

350
00:19:21,383 --> 00:19:23,787
I'm your girl, Leo.

351
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:26,000
You'll learn to trust me.

352
00:19:44,257 --> 00:19:45,993
Maybe I should have a gun, too.

353
00:19:48,743 --> 00:19:50,193
What about a taser?

354
00:19:51,838 --> 00:19:53,650
Look at this.
They cleared the place out.

355
00:19:57,391 --> 00:19:59,864
To be a kid in this sandbox.

356
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,410
I can only imagine the toys
they have in here.

357
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:08,748
Seriously?
You gotta show me how you do that.

358
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,250
Let's check it out.

359
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:12,342
What about Echo and everything?

360
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:20,693
What do you make of this?

361
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:23,994
That's my tech.

362
00:20:27,462 --> 00:20:29,476
The one DeWitt
handed over to Harding.

363
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,951
I thought it would take Rossum years
to realize my schematics.

364
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:46,828
Now that they have?

365
00:20:50,058 --> 00:20:52,041
We're even more screwed
than we thought.

366
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:53,668
With this,

367
00:20:54,301 --> 00:20:57,672
you can wipe and imprint anyone.

368
00:20:57,978 --> 00:20:59,424
No need for an Active's

369
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,445
cranial architecture
in your coconut.

370
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:03,122
One zap with the laser...

371
00:21:03,918 --> 00:21:05,116
you're a Doll!

372
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:08,975
- What is wrong with you?
- It doesn't work.

373
00:21:09,144 --> 00:21:10,191
Well, good!

374
00:21:11,622 --> 00:21:14,063
Maybe they don't have the <i>cojones</i>
to finish the job.

375
00:21:22,821 --> 00:21:24,574
They're set up for mass production.

376
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,337
This is catastrophic.

377
00:21:31,475 --> 00:21:32,716
What are you doing?

378
00:21:32,841 --> 00:21:33,791
Look around!

379
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:35,679
They're going to weaponize the tech.

380
00:21:35,804 --> 00:21:37,253
My tech. Why?

381
00:21:37,615 --> 00:21:38,737
For weapons!

382
00:21:39,115 --> 00:21:41,466
- Think.
- It got us here in the first place.

383
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:43,642
I'm going
for mindless destruction now.

384
00:21:43,767 --> 00:21:45,178
We can use this, Topher.

385
00:21:45,346 --> 00:21:47,305
If the tech stays in our hands,
we control it.

386
00:21:47,616 --> 00:21:49,632
We can stop Rossum
and get out of this building

387
00:21:49,757 --> 00:21:51,342
without taking another life.

388
00:21:52,353 --> 00:21:54,437
All you have to do is fix one of them.
Can you do it?

389
00:21:56,733 --> 00:21:57,941
In my sleep.

390
00:21:58,614 --> 00:21:59,782
Get to it then.

391
00:22:22,412 --> 00:22:24,241
I don't think so.
I'm afraid.

392
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:26,719
So am I.
That's why we have guns.

393
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,304
Take it.

394
00:22:28,429 --> 00:22:30,390
You have to learn
to protect yourself.

395
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,809
I guess I can't rely on you
to protect me all the time.

396
00:22:33,913 --> 00:22:35,602
- That's not what I meant.
- I know.

397
00:22:35,824 --> 00:22:36,992
But it's true.

398
00:22:38,448 --> 00:22:39,482
Why am I here?

399
00:22:41,365 --> 00:22:42,365
I guess...

400
00:22:44,677 --> 00:22:45,989
I couldn't let you go.

401
00:22:46,682 --> 00:22:49,242
That's very sweet.
I don't believe you.

402
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:52,036
I'm not real.
I know this.

403
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,571
Yes, you are.

404
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,909
I'm a program.

405
00:22:56,114 --> 00:22:57,208
So am I.

406
00:22:57,806 --> 00:22:58,793
And I decided,

407
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,367
it doesn't matter anymore.

408
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,258
We feel what we feel.

409
00:23:03,725 --> 00:23:05,508
I didn't want to reach
the end without you.

410
00:23:10,213 --> 00:23:11,264
What's next?

411
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:13,464
We find the mainframe.

412
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:27,064
- This is simple.
- What's that?

413
00:23:28,602 --> 00:23:31,617
It can transmit an imprint
via directional laser to the brain,

414
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,454
but it doesn't know
how to get the brain to answer.

415
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:35,898
It's not syncing.

416
00:23:36,023 --> 00:23:38,232
Like when your Bluetooth
can't find your cell.

417
00:23:38,357 --> 00:23:39,551
What's the fix?

418
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,310
The diode is reverse-biased.

419
00:23:42,812 --> 00:23:46,049
Dope the semiconductors
at the bipolar junction, voilà.

420
00:23:46,785 --> 00:23:49,552
A team of engineers
couldn't crack that, but you,

421
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:51,281
Topher Brink,

422
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:53,634
you did it in ten minutes.

423
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,158
You truly are amazing.

424
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:57,518
I'm glad I chose you.

425
00:24:00,307 --> 00:24:01,189
For what?

426
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:13,785
What are you doing?! Echo!

427
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,479
Stop! Stop, it's Boyd!

428
00:24:22,066 --> 00:24:23,885
I have enhanced weapons skills.

429
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,713
Anyone care to see a demonstration?

430
00:24:27,645 --> 00:24:29,145
The Brit goes first.

431
00:24:32,327 --> 00:24:34,480
What the hell is going on?

432
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,465
Boyd's the founder.

433
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:39,644
- He was going to kill you.
- What are you talking about?

434
00:24:40,262 --> 00:24:43,112
There is no way, not a chance
on this earth...

435
00:24:43,826 --> 00:24:45,315
It's true, Mr. Brink.

436
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:48,371
You?

437
00:24:50,453 --> 00:24:52,323
You really think
I was going to kill him?

438
00:24:53,107 --> 00:24:54,534
Why bring him here?

439
00:24:54,922 --> 00:24:56,022
Not just me?

440
00:24:56,357 --> 00:24:58,007
Why the party charades?

441
00:24:58,375 --> 00:24:59,975
You really don't know?

442
00:25:02,802 --> 00:25:04,961
You're here 'cause you're my family.

443
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:08,616
I love you guys.

444
00:25:16,737 --> 00:25:17,682
What is that?

445
00:25:19,012 --> 00:25:20,338
The cooling system.

446
00:25:20,463 --> 00:25:22,282
The mainframe generates
a lot of heat.

447
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:24,524
It takes just as much
energy to cool it down.

448
00:25:24,649 --> 00:25:26,190
We're getting close.
Come on.

449
00:25:30,308 --> 00:25:31,758
What are you doing?

450
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:34,011
- What if it doesn't?
- Doesn't what?

451
00:25:34,136 --> 00:25:36,380
Cool down. It might be all fun for you
to shoot your way

452
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,107
into a highly-fortified mainframe,

453
00:25:38,232 --> 00:25:40,163
but couldn't we just
pull the plug on the AC?

454
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:43,906
And overheat the servers.

455
00:25:45,317 --> 00:25:46,792
Thank God you're here.

456
00:25:59,869 --> 00:26:02,069
So, you're working with Saunders.

457
00:26:02,506 --> 00:26:04,806
That means when she killed Bennett,

458
00:26:04,931 --> 00:26:06,856
you killed Bennett.

459
00:26:08,205 --> 00:26:10,255
Everyone has had to sacrifice.

460
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:13,404
That's what's made you all
so incredible: your commitment,

461
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:14,798
your skills.

462
00:26:15,692 --> 00:26:18,517
Everything I've thrown at you,
you've taken, and asked for more.

463
00:26:18,642 --> 00:26:19,577
Look at you.

464
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:21,809
Risking your life for the cause,

465
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:24,534
choosing morality
over self-preservation.

466
00:26:25,351 --> 00:26:26,125
And you.

467
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:30,563
You found a strength and conviction
I'll bet you didn't even know you had.

468
00:26:30,688 --> 00:26:33,633
I pushed you,
and you pushed right back.

469
00:26:38,872 --> 00:26:40,022
You're right.

470
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:42,252
I'm the Tinman, she's the Lion,

471
00:26:42,469 --> 00:26:45,519
and you're the head
of the Lollipop Guild who's a traitor.

472
00:26:46,415 --> 00:26:49,678
You've proven yourselves in many ways.
I wanted you all with me.

473
00:26:51,517 --> 00:26:52,817
Except for Paul.

474
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,454
There's always one relative
you can live without.

475
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:57,448
I never understood
what you saw in him.

476
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,617
So you want us to keep you company,

477
00:26:59,964 --> 00:27:01,764
fiddling while Rome burns?

478
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:05,310
Thank you very much.
I'd rather be dead.

479
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,184
Death will be a blessing.

480
00:27:07,514 --> 00:27:10,169
When it happens, you'll likely be
imprinted and enslaved.

481
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,624
We have to face the facts.
The technology exists.

482
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:16,449
It can't be un-invented.

483
00:27:17,164 --> 00:27:19,700
Once it gets out there,
it will be abused.

484
00:27:19,825 --> 00:27:21,806
None of us can prevent
that from happening,

485
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,101
but we can choose where we want to be,
and on what side,

486
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,322
when the end finally does arrive.

487
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,581
Do you want to be the destroyed,

488
00:27:30,616 --> 00:27:31,701
or the destroyers?

489
00:27:31,826 --> 00:27:33,776
You are spectacularly insane.

490
00:27:34,695 --> 00:27:35,945
I believed you.

491
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:40,123
You pretended to care for me,
and I believed you.

492
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:44,036
- How could you do that?
- I know you're angry.

493
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:46,122
Don't touch me.

494
00:27:47,574 --> 00:27:48,574
I did...

495
00:27:50,209 --> 00:27:51,609
I do care for you.

496
00:27:52,346 --> 00:27:54,055
More than you'll ever know.

497
00:27:54,268 --> 00:27:57,132
Who do you think allowed you
to grow as an individual as Echo?

498
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,969
While they were sending you
out to bed half of Los Angeles,

499
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:03,347
I was here making sure you had
the space to become your own person.

500
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,431
- Why?
- You're the key.

501
00:28:06,551 --> 00:28:08,151
The key to everything.

502
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:10,023
You're going to save us all.

503
00:28:10,148 --> 00:28:11,798
I won't save you, Boyd.

504
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,775
Given the first chance,
I will kill you.

505
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,793
I have no doubt you'll try.

506
00:28:17,136 --> 00:28:20,740
But the fact still remains that inside
that body of yours is everlasting life.

507
00:28:21,711 --> 00:28:24,399
Every time your nervous system
blocks an imprint,

508
00:28:24,524 --> 00:28:27,784
it leaves neurochemical tracers
in your cerebrospinal column.

509
00:28:29,462 --> 00:28:31,552
We've tried to replicate it,
but we can't.

510
00:28:31,677 --> 00:28:33,727
It's unique to your physiology.

511
00:28:34,866 --> 00:28:36,630
So we're going
to harvest it from you.

512
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:41,567
- What are you talking about?
- We're going to use your spinal fluid

513
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:43,860
to make a vaccine
against imprinting.

514
00:28:43,985 --> 00:28:45,896
Is such a thing even possible?

515
00:28:47,076 --> 00:28:49,229
The mad scientist
in me says, "Yes. "

516
00:28:49,354 --> 00:28:51,312
You come any closer,
I will snap your neck.

517
00:28:51,702 --> 00:28:53,002
I'm sorry, Echo.

518
00:28:54,522 --> 00:28:55,622
I really am.

519
00:29:08,382 --> 00:29:11,494
Tell me they taught you how
to sabotage supercomputers at Quantico.

520
00:29:13,009 --> 00:29:16,518
Right after the course on toppling evil
corporations bent on world domination.

521
00:29:19,268 --> 00:29:20,591
Where do we start?

522
00:29:21,329 --> 00:29:22,579
How about here?

523
00:29:26,411 --> 00:29:28,539
I don't think there's an elegant way
to do this.

524
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:31,189
- Good. I hate elegant.
- Me, too.

525
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:44,365
Bring the secondary
cooling system online.

526
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,083
I'll handle the rest.

527
00:29:48,955 --> 00:29:50,621
There's a phrase I want you to say.

528
00:29:51,515 --> 00:29:52,581
How does it go?

529
00:29:53,034 --> 00:29:54,792
Somthing about flowers in a vase.

530
00:29:55,323 --> 00:29:57,086
Activate Mellie's sleeper protocol?

531
00:29:58,265 --> 00:29:59,550
I won't do it.

532
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:03,509
Go ahead and shoot.

533
00:30:04,238 --> 00:30:06,536
I'm sure I'll be far
more talkative with my brains

534
00:30:06,661 --> 00:30:08,288
splattered all over Topher.

535
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:13,487
What now?

536
00:30:13,773 --> 00:30:15,938
We're going to have company.
Come on.

537
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:24,989
Aim, breathe, fire.

538
00:30:26,376 --> 00:30:29,158
It's set for single shots,
so you don't need to crazy, okay?

539
00:30:29,283 --> 00:30:31,287
We just have to hold on
until Echo finishes the job.

540
00:30:32,129 --> 00:30:33,279
You got this.

541
00:30:45,732 --> 00:30:47,595
There are three flowers in a vase.

542
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:48,971
Cover your ears!

543
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:50,723
The third flower is green.

544
00:31:03,854 --> 00:31:04,945
It's me, Paul!

545
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:07,150
I'm not going to shoot you!

546
00:31:21,136 --> 00:31:23,271
Listen to me.
You're not a killer!

547
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:26,967
Mellie, remember us!
Remember what we had!

548
00:31:39,627 --> 00:31:41,232
I can't.

549
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:42,857
You can.

550
00:31:43,026 --> 00:31:44,443
You can fight this.

551
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,945
You know who you are.

552
00:31:49,798 --> 00:31:51,398
When we were together,

553
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:53,661
you made me feel like a real person.

554
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,783
There's no reason to be scared.

555
00:32:24,622 --> 00:32:27,444
The entire process is designed
to extract your spinal fluid

556
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,779
without killing you.

557
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:34,860
Everything's going to be all right.

558
00:32:35,608 --> 00:32:36,608
Go to hell.

559
00:32:41,427 --> 00:32:43,024
Begin the extraction.

560
00:33:12,402 --> 00:33:14,366
Get her out of that thing,
or you're gonna end up

561
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:15,951
with holes in your back.

562
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:17,077
Move!

563
00:33:26,062 --> 00:33:28,339
Thought you two would be
on a beach in Cancun by now.

564
00:33:28,946 --> 00:33:31,342
Never left a man behind before.
Not going to start today.

565
00:33:32,023 --> 00:33:33,594
Besides, we're a family.

566
00:33:34,593 --> 00:33:35,679
Do me a favor.

567
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,557
Call us whatever you want,
just not family.

568
00:33:40,983 --> 00:33:42,061
You know about Boyd?

569
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:43,812
Yeah. Didn't see that one coming.

570
00:33:43,981 --> 00:33:47,107
He's holding Adelle and Topher
in a research lab, same level,

571
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:49,212
other side of facility.

572
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,654
Free them,
then find Paul and Mellie.

573
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:53,614
Get everybody out of here.

574
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:55,362
What are you going to do?

575
00:33:55,487 --> 00:33:57,873
Something Caroline tried to do
two years ago.

576
00:33:59,062 --> 00:34:00,537
Shut this place down for good.

577
00:34:08,591 --> 00:34:09,841
I did all this.

578
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:16,438
I'm the one who brings
about the thought-pocalypse.

579
00:34:17,272 --> 00:34:18,389
Thought-pocalypse?

580
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:21,000
Is brain-pocalypse better?

581
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:25,112
I figure, if I'm responsible
for the end of the world,

582
00:34:25,237 --> 00:34:26,456
I get to name it.

583
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,407
I gave the plans to Harding.
I'm just as culpable.

584
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:32,320
Thanks, Adelle.

585
00:34:33,552 --> 00:34:35,852
You handed someone a piece of paper.

586
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:38,283
I invented it.

587
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,496
- Which means, I have to destroy it.
- Stop.

588
00:34:43,197 --> 00:34:44,248
They'll kill you.

589
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:51,839
- You all right?
- Take cover.

590
00:34:52,144 --> 00:34:53,298
- Excuse me?
- Now!

591
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,420
Army of one.

592
00:35:13,588 --> 00:35:14,528
You still me?

593
00:35:14,936 --> 00:35:17,072
Cause I could use someone
to shoulder some of the guilt.

594
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,407
It's Anthony.

595
00:35:18,736 --> 00:35:20,868
- With some enhancements.
- Clearly.

596
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,286
What next?

597
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:24,662
Mr. Brink?

598
00:35:26,827 --> 00:35:28,208
We destroy the prototypes,

599
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,210
the plans for the prototypes,

600
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:33,213
and every piece of equipment
used to make the prototypes.

601
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:37,092
We wipe this tech
off the face of the earth.

602
00:35:43,751 --> 00:35:46,101
Who let the lab rat out of its cage?

603
00:35:46,943 --> 00:35:47,943
Claire...

604
00:35:48,692 --> 00:35:50,981
Whiskey, whoever can hear me...

605
00:35:52,001 --> 00:35:53,025
this isn't you.

606
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,736
Deep down, you know it's true.

607
00:35:56,464 --> 00:35:57,905
You can overpower him.

608
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,037
Still Clyde.

609
00:36:06,102 --> 00:36:09,750
You know, this is the first time I can
hit a girl without feeling bad about it.

610
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:13,003
You think Topher loaded me up
with nice personalities?

611
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:16,381
I will scrub the floor with you.

612
00:36:19,533 --> 00:36:21,261
15 years of switching bodies.

613
00:36:21,703 --> 00:36:23,722
I've made some improvements
to the OS.

614
00:36:24,137 --> 00:36:27,087
Besides, I don't care
what happens to this body.

615
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:28,581
You do.

616
00:36:29,246 --> 00:36:31,246
What do you mean, she escaped?

617
00:36:32,187 --> 00:36:33,787
No. I'll deal with it.

618
00:36:44,488 --> 00:36:45,577
She killed Mellie.

619
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:47,728
What?

620
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,486
She triggered Mellie, and...

621
00:36:55,797 --> 00:36:57,442
... she killed herself.

622
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:02,761
I'm sorry, Paul.

623
00:37:05,462 --> 00:37:06,390
She's evil.

624
00:37:07,914 --> 00:37:09,349
We have to stop her.

625
00:37:09,474 --> 00:37:10,474
I know.

626
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:13,522
Whoever's running things got to her.
She turned on all of us.

627
00:37:16,970 --> 00:37:18,735
Let's take that bitch down for good.

628
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,573
I know just where she is.

629
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:47,681
We're going to kill each other.

630
00:37:48,168 --> 00:37:50,809
I have 20 houses filled
with bodies waiting for me.

631
00:38:00,588 --> 00:38:03,614
Even if you're on life support,
we can still tap your spine.

632
00:38:36,446 --> 00:38:38,273
Paul, what are you doing?

633
00:38:38,768 --> 00:38:40,394
Take it easy. It's...

634
00:38:44,272 --> 00:38:45,572
What did I miss?

635
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:50,035
It's him. He's the founder.

636
00:38:50,765 --> 00:38:52,663
He's been lying to us
this whole time.

637
00:38:52,832 --> 00:38:54,247
Question is, who are you?

638
00:38:55,633 --> 00:38:57,583
Caroline? Echo?

639
00:38:57,817 --> 00:39:00,067
- I'm everything you made me.
- Good.

640
00:39:00,501 --> 00:39:02,673
Then that means you still
trust me with your life.

641
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,968
You said you'd protect me.
I believed you. You son of a bitch!

642
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,929
I did protect you.
Now it's your turn to protect all of us.

643
00:39:10,052 --> 00:39:12,307
You're going to be
the savior of the world.

644
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:14,231
I trusted you.

645
00:39:14,356 --> 00:39:16,186
Shoot. Don't think.

646
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,521
- Shoot.
- She can't.

647
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,607
Caroline doesn't know you,

648
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,693
but Echo loves you.
She'd never...

649
00:39:40,959 --> 00:39:43,046
I wanted to keep you
around because I like you,

650
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:45,549
but I don't really need you alive.

651
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:48,719
I loved you.

652
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,179
I know.

653
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:11,689
Did I fall asleep?

654
00:40:14,861 --> 00:40:16,371
For a little while.

655
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:37,640
I want you to take this.

656
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,063
After I leave, walk into there...

657
00:40:44,597 --> 00:40:46,297
... and pull the pin out.

658
00:40:47,552 --> 00:40:48,769
Do you understand?

659
00:40:51,274 --> 00:40:52,774
I try to be my best.

660
00:40:57,006 --> 00:40:58,006
Good.

661
00:41:24,098 --> 00:41:25,190
Everybody out!

662
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:27,776
I got Saunders out.

663
00:41:28,362 --> 00:41:30,237
- Where's Echo?
- She said she's coming.

664
00:42:18,609 --> 00:42:21,371
So, did we save the world?

665
00:42:23,198 --> 00:42:24,416
I guess we did.

666
00:42:57,646 --> 00:42:58,873
Let them go.

667
00:43:00,018 --> 00:43:01,453
We got to keep moving.
