1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,500
Reviously in Dollhouse :

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,950
In their resting state, our actives are
as innocent and vulnerable as children.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,240
We call it the tabula rasa, blank slate.

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:16,300
Now imagine the imprint process
fillin it, creating a new personality.

5
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:19,630
A friend, a lover, A... and when
the engagement has been completed...

6
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,730
all memory of it will be wiped clean.

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:25,710
I try to do my best.

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:28,410
Hey, neighbor. Off early?

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,480
Ooh, pretty. Is she in trouble?

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,530
Maybe. Just got caught
up with the wrong people.

11
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:37,390
Either way, I'll keep
looking until I find her.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,110
Lucky girl.

13
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,480
You don't write. You don't call.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,960
- How did you get this number?
- Dollhouse. Start hopping.

15
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,090
I don't know any dollhouse.

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,890
Then find another
honest citizen who does.

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,470
you will have a new
friend living with you.

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,040
Her name is sierra.

19
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,690
Sierra?

20
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:27,010
* superstar, superstar,
driving in your fancy car *

21
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,550
* wishing you could take me home *

22
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,310
* you've got the lingo and the pedigree
to flip the script and get to me *

23
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,370
* but you just can't get off the phone *

24
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,340
* don't mean to burst your bubble *

25
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,120
* don't want to waste your time *

26
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:45,850
* I've got the feeling your
priorities are out of line *

27
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,520
* even though I know you're
trouble you're gonna do just fine *

28
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,410
* you've rehearsed your lines and
now it's time for you to shine *

29
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:57,040
* you're such a star
go on and take it away *

30
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:00,730
* go on and take
it away-ay-ay-ay *

31
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,830
* you play my heart with
every word that you say *

32
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,870
* and toss it you tear it, rip
it up you're gonna smash it *

33
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:13,890
* shopping sprees and limousines
flash a little je Y...*

34
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:28,650
get her locked down now!

35
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm sorry. I was dizzy.

36
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,110
I didn't want you to get
hurt. You're my friend.

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,510
Friends help each other out.

38
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,960
Yes, they do.

39
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,220
You shouldn't have taken the arrow out.

40
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,190
You could have bled to death.

41
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,250
And a broadhead arrow does
more damage coming out.

42
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:30,520
I'll remember that next
time I'm being bow-hunted.

43
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,900
But you're healing nicely.

44
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,350
So I'm certified?

45
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,900
I really would recommend you
take a few more days, mr. Langton.

46
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:42,490
You know you can call me boyd.

47
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,380
Is there a reason I'd want to?

48
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,170
Look, if you don't certify me
and echo gets sent out again,

49
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,420
she could end up with some
stranger as her handler.

50
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,630
We're strangs to them.

51
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,770
She's my responsibility.

52
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,300
And we both know there's
someone out there.

53
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,770
Someone who wants her dead.

54
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:05,980
The word from upstairs
is it can't be alpha.

55
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,800
You're certified.

56
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,160
Thank you.

57
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,180
And do keep a close eye.

58
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,620
Someone else is watching.

59
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,710
Someone always is.

60
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,610
Did you forget your key again...

61
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,120
Oh, I startle you, you startle me.

62
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,040
- Can I help you?
- I'm, uh, a friend of paul.

63
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,440
Really?

64
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:44,300
An old friend from... navy.

65
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,600
Friend from old navy.
I did retail before.

66
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,490
He would buy slacks.

67
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,110
He told me he would be home.

68
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,850
He should be back soon.

69
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,620
You're a friend of paul,
too? Good fend, yeah?

70
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,430
Waiting by the door?

71
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:04,380
No, I just happened to... we're not...

72
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:08,360
you're making coffee in
there? Enough for two?

73
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,070
Did you want to leave him a message?

74
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,350
Here.

75
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,600
Tell him to meet me friday
night at this place. Not at work.

76
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,390
He comes by my work, he bothers me...

77
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,290
and my bosses get very mad.

78
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,900
- At old navy?
- You give him card.

79
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,060
Bye.

80
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,140
Hello, biz.

81
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,690
I did try to respect your no-sunglasses
rule, but what is this, a greenhouse?

82
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:44,960
I'm photosynthesizing here.

83
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,330
All right.

84
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,580
Bless.

85
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,300
Didn't know you were in town.

86
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:56,000
Rayna's at the henry fonda.

87
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,000
- Not the forum? -
It's the pre-release.

88
00:05:58,010 --> 00:06:00,700
You know, the intimate evening gigs.

89
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,510
Remind everyone that she's an artist.

90
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,080
Actually sings the damned songs.

91
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,830
We do the stadiums in the summer.

92
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:13,690
Sounds exhausting. I can have the twins
freed up in a day or so if you need to unwind.

93
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:18,200
Someone's trying to kill rayna.

94
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,370
And to my utter
astonishment, it isn't me.

95
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,610
Kill her? Are you certain?

96
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:26,660
Did you hear about the
accident in kansas city?

97
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,120
Flash pot with a double
charge. Girl on fire.

98
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,430
It wasn't an accident?

99
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:33,680
Actually, it was, yes.

100
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:37,150
We changed up the choreography that day.
Should have been rayna standing there.

101
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,030
Was that the only time?

102
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,730
No, we had a lighting
rig come loose in philly.

103
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,710
Got tangled up in the flies.

104
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,800
How's rayna dealing with all this?

105
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:48,200
I'm worried about her.

106
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:51,960
She seemed erratic, disconnected lately.

107
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:54,980
Even moodier if that
is physically possible.

108
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:59,600
Here. Have a look at this.

109
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,470
Rayna's had stalkers ever since she was
singing for the mouse, but this guy...

110
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,920
and to think, some people don't
believe in everlasting love.

111
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,540
Meanwhile, rayna needs to be
protected and not by bodyguards.

112
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,020
Oh, she hates those guys.

113
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,500
Yes, feels like a prisoner,
blah-biddy, blah-blah-blah.

114
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,000
Anyway, this guy can dodge them.

115
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:29,500
No, what she needs is someone by
her side that she likes, she trusts,

116
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:32,280
and will protect her without
even knowing she's supposed to.

117
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,290
So there's risk?

118
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,020
Absolutely.

119
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,820
She's got to be willing to
take a bullet for my girl.

120
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:40,270
I will try to make sure
it doesn't come to that.

121
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:44,680
What we do need is a credible reason
for our active to be in rayna's life.

122
00:07:44,690 --> 00:07:49,480
Yes, well, as it happens,
we do have an opening.

123
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:52,490
* I've got to find the freedom *

124
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,140
* that's promised me freedom from
our struggles and our misery...*

125
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,100
I really love this song.

126
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,590
I have the feeling that
she could be trouble.

127
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:07,880
I smell... attitude.

128
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:12,520
* Each day when sun
shines upon my eyes *

129
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,590
* it fills me with love,
makes me feel alive *

130
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,560
* I'm saving it up for a rainy day *

131
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:25,080
* when there's no
light to guide my way *

132
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,740
* We've got to find a
freedom that's promised me *

133
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,930
* freedom from our
struggles and our misery *

134
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:39,680
* freedom is all we need *

135
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:46,050
* to heal the pain of history.*

136
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,570
Rayna, love, perhaps we should just
take a minute to, um, you know...

137
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,420
get her working.

138
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,080
- I got the job?
- Yes, yes.

139
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,040
You, uh, you got the job.

140
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,620
Oh, my god!

141
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,620
Why isn't she working yet?

142
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,950
Lucky girl.

143
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,860
Thank you so much! Oh, my god!

147
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,940
You sent echo out on
a high-risk engagement?

148
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:59,500
Dr.Saunders, hey, so
good of you to annoy me.

149
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:04,480
I had her flagged for romantic
or altruistic engagements only.

150
00:10:04,690 --> 00:10:06,770
Does anybody read these?

151
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:09,650
Her last romantic engagement turned
out to be extremely high-risk.

152
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,100
Maybe her engagement with
rayna will turn romantic.

153
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,420
She's bodyguard?

154
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,400
She's a singer.

155
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,980
Persona and parameter:Two
separate elements.

156
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,430
Persona:She's a struggling singer
who just got her first break.

157
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,130
Parameter:She must protect rayna,

158
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,290
which she will do instinctively
and unconsciously at all times.

159
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:34,870
So she doesn't even
know she's a bodyguard.

160
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,740
And this makes what better?

161
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,620
Who do you want?

162
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,780
Someone who's paid to protect you
or someone who wants to protect you?

163
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:44,170
This is the beauty of w do.

164
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,780
T we and what about boyd?

165
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,720
He's not up to any
serious physical threat.

166
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,750
Boyd? What are you guys, buddies now?

167
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,690
Oh, god, of course you are.

168
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,110
You both disapprove of everything.

169
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:05,960
You're gonna get married
and have scowly babies.

170
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,900
Don't be an idiot.

171
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,910
not to stress. We're
sending in backup anyway.

172
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,580
Would you please have a seat?

173
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,180
all right, stop. Stop, stop.
That's what I was talking about.

174
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,340
You guys gotta come in
tighter on me on the eight.

175
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,350
You move any sooner than that, and I'm gonna
be steppin' all over you like a hot mess, okay?

176
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:45,090
It goes boom, pop, and
seven and eight. Hit that.

177
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:50,640
And five, six.

178
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:56,190
that's fine, but jordan,
softer on your consonants.

179
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,880
Okay. I haven't seen all the lyrics
yet, so I'm kinda flying blind here.

180
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:02,550
I need a lyric book
for the new girl now!

181
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
Ey're not very good lyrics.

182
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,910
- A lot "ooh"s and "ah"s?
- Yes.

183
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,390
Try not to move, please.

184
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,470
Oh, sorry.

185
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:12,510
- So is this your first big tour?
- Big one? Yes.

186
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,430
I've been working a lot, but
nothing like rayna russell.

187
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:18,270
I mean, this is the dream gig.

188
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,770
What's up with all the muscle?

189
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:25,500
- Oh, you heard about that "accident," right?
- Yeah.

190
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,360
Well, first, there was three bodyguards.

191
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:30,530
Now there's eight, plus
a whole security staff.

192
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,870
And they don't bring
in her fan mail anymore.

193
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,180
What I hear, it goes
straight to the police.

194
00:12:35,210 --> 00:12:38,390
Stop, stop. Let's do it
one more time from the top.

195
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,610
And what about her? Diva or diva?

196
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:46,650
It depends on the day. I
mean, she's the real deal.

197
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,190
She's earning it.

198
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,540
All right, ladies, here you go.

199
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:00,260
we had to replace the monitor board, so you
are gonna have to get there an hour earlier.

200
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,810
Thank you. Hello, girls.

201
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,080
Bra off, please. Try this on.

202
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,540
should we, uh, go to the bathroom or...

203
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:13,970
Honey, you've got three
quick changes during the show.

204
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,370
They're all gonna see your stuff now or
later, so you might as well get used to it.

205
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,230
Is it always this crazy?

206
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,780
Okay, stop! Stop!

207
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,500
Who's eating a mint?

208
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,800
Somebody is eating a mint!

209
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,850
Okay, I-I can't breathe!

210
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:40,450
And I think we're done here. Rayna,
darling, let's get you over to the venue.

211
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,230
Yes, indeed.

212
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,060
Hey, now that you're done flashing everybody,
you want to roll with me to sound check?

213
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:49,990
We can go over your
harmonies in the car.

214
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,630
Cool with me.

215
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:56,250
Well, looky who's pick of the week.

216
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,960
nice view.

217
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,820
Yeah, look at all the pretty lights, and the people
look like ants and I casee my house from here.

218
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:33,100
You trying to get me killed?

219
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
I wasn't followed.

220
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:38,520
Yeah, yeah, you cannot be sniffing
around the family and talking to me.

221
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,140
The borons see us together, we both get
a death, and I don't get the nice one.

222
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,280
Besides, the family's clean on this.

223
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,070
They traffic girls.

224
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:49,580
Maybe, maybe not, but
they don't brainwash them.

225
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,050
I thought you got something I could use.

226
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,720
Yeah, yeah, I did what you asked.

227
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:58,380
I start throwing the word "dollhouse" around,
my people, they look at me like I'm a tourist.

228
00:14:58,390 --> 00:15:00,290
I can't afford that.

229
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,120
Maybe you're too small-time.

230
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,890
It's a myth, okay?It's an urban legend:

231
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:09,240
Young people having their personalities
replaced so that they could be the perfect date?

232
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,780
it's-it's alligators in the sewers!

233
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:14,970
I've heard this song.
It's not my favorite.

234
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,830
You got no leads.

235
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,330
anything you think you had led
you to me, and I'm a dead end.

236
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,400
You don't know what I got.

237
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:28,210
What you got is the nicest
version of "fired" the bi has.

238
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,030
See, you don't know me, but I
checked you out plenty, agent ballard.

239
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,630
You don't close.

240
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,820
The van dynes, illinois gun club.

241
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:41,110
Bureau takes pity, gives you the one job
you can't blow because it doesn't exist.

242
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,200
The technology exists.

243
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,250
It... somebody made
a monkey tango, right?

244
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,190
It doesn't mean it's
being used on people.

245
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,530
It does. It means that.

246
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,740
How do you know?

247
00:15:57,970 --> 00:16:02,170
We split the atom, we make a bomb.

248
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:06,150
We come up with anything
new, the first thing we do is

249
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,480
destroy, manipulate, control.

250
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,990
It's human nature.

251
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,060
Yeah, people are mostly crap.

252
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,910
I don't think there's a dollhouse.

253
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,360
I hear different, I'll get word.

254
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,750
Personally, I wish there was.

255
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,590
How come?

256
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:34,300
So I could sign up, wipe all
of my terrible burdens away.

257
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,560
We'll keep you in mind.

258
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:39,280
I start over, I wanna
be doris freakin' day.

259
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,660
Right, so, I know this isn't my place,
but I was just walking off my nerves,

260
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,190
and I noticed there's no
security by the freight elevator.

261
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,110
And it seems like somebody
could get in there.

262
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,580
You know, if you're worried about
a homicidal fan or something.

263
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:55,240
Good eyes, jordan.

264
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,340
Sierra should come
into play in a minute.

265
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,900
I'm glad they double-tracked this.

266
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,010
Who's handling her?

267
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,150
Joe hearn. You won't like him.

268
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,540
15 minutes to curtain.

269
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:08,500
Echo's on in 15. Okay. Okay.

270
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:11,060
Oh, my god, are you nervous?

271
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,510
Opening-night jitters?

272
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,920
Your little girl out
there on the big stage?

273
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,140
On the stage where the last
little girl caught fire?

274
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:17,950
A fair point.

275
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,890
I mean, her singing's not a problem.

276
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:23,720
It's not, right? I mean, she is
a good singer. I think she's good.

277
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:24,820
She wouldn't freeze up?

278
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,510
She'll be fine, mama rose.

279
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,290
What's the deal with rayna?

280
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,090
You got the inside edition.
Is she cool? What's she like?

281
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,980
If you like shallow,
vapid, narcissistic girls.

282
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,650
Really? Shallow?

283
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:41,690
She seemed so earthy and
normal with katie couric.

284
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,520
You just can't trust people anymore.

285
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,520
You think you know someone.

286
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,200
Hello, victor. How are you feeling?

287
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,910
Did I fall asleep?

288
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,240
Deep breaths help to
prevent pre-show barfing.

289
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,330
Biz taught me that trick when I was 12.

290
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,890
Rayna, this is audra,
winner of the #1 fan contest.

291
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,380
She flew all the way in from australia.

292
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:31,690
Oh, hey, sweetie, I'd love to hang, but
I've got a show to do. You understand, right?

293
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,160
Of course.

294
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,740
Oh, my god, oh, my god,
oh, my god, oh, my god!

295
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,360
That was weird. Weird adoration.

296
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:39,410
No, what's weird is that
I don't even notice it.

297
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,160
* you're a superstar everyone
knows who you are you think, *

298
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:22,080
* superstar, superstar,
driving in your fancy car *

299
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,610
* wishing you could take me home *

300
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:29,250
* you've got the lingo and the pedigree
to flip the script and get to me *

301
00:19:29,290 --> 00:19:33,300
* but you just can't get off the phone *

302
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,280
* don't mean to burst your bubble *

303
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,140
* don't want to waste your time *

304
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,850
* I've got the feeling your
priorities are out of line *

305
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:44,570
* even though I know you're
trouble you're gonna do just fine *

306
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,070
Are you sure this is safe?

307
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,820
This is my party.

308
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:05,140
You know all these people?

309
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,280
Girl, relax. We're surrounded.

310
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,790
I know.

311
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,170
what in the hell is this
skank doing at my table?

312
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:26,490
- I told you...
- rayna!

313
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,840
You remember audra, yes, winner
of the online video contest?

314
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:33,170
She's your #1 fan.

315
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,340
Why do you always try to hurt me?

316
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,500
Be a saint.

317
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,620
You have no idea how much it means
to me that you're here tonight.

318
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:51,370
- My god.
- Shave aeat.

319
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,240
uh, I just have to say, you are so
beautiful and talented and you saved my life.

320
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:02,890
I had your first cd before any of my
friends, and, you know, I-I told them...

321
00:21:02,930 --> 00:21:05,110
okay, okay. Slow down.

322
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,430
Listen, sweetheart.
You can just hang. Okay?

323
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,260
Turn off fan mode and turn on, um...

324
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,360
- what's your name again?
- Audra.

325
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,740
Turn on audra mode.

326
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:17,520
Audra mode. Okay.

327
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:18,610
What are you drinking?

328
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,170
Oh, it's a shirley
temple. They're delicious.

329
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:25,610
Plus, I'm a lightweight, and I want to be able to
remember every single detail of my time with you.

330
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,390
Oh, geez...

331
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:30,640
well, you're making us feel like alcoholics
over here. Why don't you have some champagne?

332
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,510
Okay.

333
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,540
Unbelievable.

334
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:39,700
I mean... is it always like this?

335
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,430
People just do whatever
you tell them to?

336
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:48,480
If she wanted you to take off your
clothes and run down the street right now,

337
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:50,800
just for kicks, would you do it?

338
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,260
Oh, with or without my undies?

339
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,140
Damn, girl. You need to chill.

340
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,430
That was so cool.

341
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,550
I'm a southie.

342
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:24,460
So, agent ballard.

343
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,970
Maybe I got something for you after all.

344
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,490
It used to be called
the devonshire hotel.

345
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,180
You know, big noise back when
hollywood still had its dignity.

346
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,820
If it's abandoned,
what am I looking for?

347
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,050
The basement.

348
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,750
If people were being held, they
probably would have been down there.

349
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,870
Hey, I'm getting this third-hand.
I still think it goes nowhere.

350
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,120
Then why call?

351
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:45,840
Because you inspire terrible
pity. Watch your back.

352
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,120
you wanted to mess with the borodins?

353
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,930
Actually, I didn'T.

354
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,210
Idiot.

355
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,890
************

356
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:07,350
Do you know who we are?

357
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:09,970
We are the last faces you see.

358
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,920
what do you know about the dollhouse?

359
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:30,410
I don't know what you're talking about!

360
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:35,860
No one ever does.

361
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,010
911.

362
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,140
It takes 40 minutes to get coffee?

363
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,830
You had eyes on 'em.

364
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:02,240
'Sides, my girl only comes into
play in an extreme scenario.

365
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,220
What you got there?

366
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:08,450
Rayna's fan sites.

367
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,830
There's hundreds of these things.

368
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,650
Ah, a bunch of crazies.

369
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:13,220
That's what I'm looking for.

370
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,500
Our man had to have
been on this somewhere.

371
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,820
Right. You're the ex-cop.

372
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,300
Investigating is
somebody else's problem.

373
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:25,690
We just keep an eye out, pull
our girls when the job's done.

374
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,730
This sierra is new, isn't she?

375
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:34,520
What happened to the previous sierra?

376
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:37,620
She got the job done.

377
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,510
What?

378
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,520
It's me!

379
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,940
Get in here.

380
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:51,080
Damn, girl.

381
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,970
Oh, aren't they gorgeous?

382
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,270
You know, orchids are the
symbol of pure affection.

383
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,330
Ye wo you sure have a lot of them.

384
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,980
They help me relax.

385
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:03,390
Nice. I could use some of that.

386
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:08,200
Have you ever felt
so unbelievably alive?

387
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,130
this is gonna be the
best night of my life!

388
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,860
I am ready. I am so ready.

389
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,470
- Go on. Right there.
- Oh, thanks.

390
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,850
hey, I thought you weren't
getting fan mail anymore.

391
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,520
These people think they actually
have a relationship with you.

392
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,260
Comes with the territory.

393
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:42,720
My music touches people, so
they want to touch me back.

394
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,040
Shouldn't the cops be
getting all this stuff?

395
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:47,040
Oh, those are old.

396
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,120
This one isn'T.

397
00:26:49,170 --> 00:26:51,630
It mentions last night's show.

398
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:56,900
These are all from the same guy.

399
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:03,100
It's him. The one they're all afraid of.

400
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:05,370
You're communicating with him?

401
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:07,820
He's my #1 fan.

402
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,150
Audra's a sweet girl, but...

403
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,490
she's got nothing on him.

404
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,230
Yo, he's not a fan. He's insane.

405
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,030
What do you know?

406
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,040
You're a background singer.

407
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,480
A wannabe. A nothing.

408
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:25,400
- three minutes!
- Show time.

409
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,440
The biggest show ever.

410
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,760
TONIGHT

411
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,610
WILL BE YOU LAST...

412
00:27:58,150 --> 00:28:00,600
GOODBYE!

413
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,630
Don't do this!

414
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,350
This is what I do.

415
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,030
He's gonna kill you.

416
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,200
I think you know that.

417
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,300
You have no idea what it's like.

418
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,390
You can't go out there.

419
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,640
You don't tell me what
I can and can't do.

420
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,660
You want him to shoot
you. On stage. Tonight.

421
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:18,880
You're crazier than he is.

422
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,420
I'm not crazy.

423
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:23,750
I just wanto be free.

424
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,450
Biz!

425
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:50,220
* Boy, I've been watching
you, stalking you I know...*

426
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,450
biz!

427
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:57,930
* Are you all alone tonight?'Cause
you're looking fine *

428
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:02,130
* and I want to make you mine *

429
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,380
* I think I could be the one for you *

430
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:11,500
* if you think that, too,
you need to make your move *

431
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,340
you have to stop the show. Rayna...

432
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,170
jordan, get your ass stage left.

433
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,570
- Where's biz?
- I'll take you there myself.

434
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,440
I will smack you.

435
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,380
* baby, make your
move make your move...*

436
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:34,240
You guys got me in the mood tonight.

437
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:40,400
I want you to meet somebody special.

438
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:44,120
This person...

439
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,960
reminds me why I do what I do.

440
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:54,510
You know who you are.

441
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,660
Come on. Show yourself!

442
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:07,480
Give it up for my #1 fan!

443
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,910
this is audra!

444
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:18,960
What up, los angeles?

445
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,210
he's here. I feel it. I know it.

446
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,300
Stop the show.

447
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:32,380
- Because the background singer said so?
- Do it.

448
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,220
There's no way psycho
got through security.

449
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,760
U know how many extra guys
I hired just for tonight?

450
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,480
Just relax.

451
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:41,980
Hey, wait a minute.

452
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,680
rayna, get down!

453
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,100
we got gunshot wounds to
the right lower abdomen.

454
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,790
Can you hear me?

455
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,140
What's your name, buddy?

456
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,450
chest sounds are good;
no sign of hothorax.

457
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,760
He's cyanotic. I thought
the lungs checked out.

458
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,380
- Must be the gases.
- I'm gonna lay some pvc.

459
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,930
He's gonna arrest...
any... minute. Here we go.

460
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,110
What the hell is wrong with you?

461
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
- With me?
- You shut down my show.

462
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,310
I saved your life.

463
00:31:57,330 --> 00:32:00,050
You've got no understanding of my life.

464
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,480
Okay, are there any drugs you're not on?

465
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,070
The guy was about to put a bullet in
you, which, ps: Also stops the show.

466
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:09,340
You disappointed all those people.

467
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,960
I was gonna give 'em a show.

468
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,790
Now all they'll say is I
didn't give 'em a finish.

469
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:19,720
They don't want to see you die.

470
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,880
Did they grow you in a lab?

471
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,620
Do you know anything about people?

472
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:27,960
They'd love to see me die.

473
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,880
80 years old, they'd be talking
about tonight-- they was there when.

474
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:39,900
Rayna... you are not okay, okay?

475
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,730
You are having a breakdown.

476
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:46,030
Not a shave-your-head,
flash-your-junk whacky phase.

477
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,910
You are truly unwell.

478
00:32:47,950 --> 00:32:49,800
So he puts me out of my misery.

479
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,700
What misery?

480
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,230
What have you got to be miserable about?

481
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:57,060
No. Right, uh...

482
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:01,500
I got to be happy. I got to be
grateful.I got to be rebellious--

483
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:04,790
but just enough to give me cred, so
people know I'm not a factory girl.

484
00:33:07,950 --> 00:33:10,210
But I am.

485
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,520
I don't exist. I'm not a real person.

486
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,340
I'm everybody's fantasy.

487
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:24,400
And god help me if I try not to be.

488
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,350
no, you weren't grown
in the lab, but I was.

489
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:37,810
been singing for my supper since when
and before when for everybody else!

490
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,890
God put this voice in me
and forgot to make it mine.

491
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:49,950
I don't feel it. I don't feel anything.

492
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,160
For a long while.

493
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,580
But I know he's out there, the reaper,

494
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:05,340
and any minute now...freedom.

495
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,900
There's your rush. There's your joy.

496
00:34:10,930 --> 00:34:13,650
I can hear. I can hear myself.

497
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,570
I think you hear yourself just fine.

498
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:20,600
Maybe you want to listen to
someone else, like, say, ever.

499
00:34:21,470 --> 00:34:24,270
- You don't like your life, change it.
- They won't let me!

500
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,950
You make them let you.

501
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,040
You're feeling pain, but all
you're doing is spreading it around.

502
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:32,700
The last thing I ever thought
you'd turn out to be was weak.

503
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:35,020
I want you out of here.

504
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:40,480
You say anything to biz, I'll tell every psycho fan
I got right where you live, and you won't last a day.

505
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,830
oh, this gig was supposed to change
everything for me and now I'm thinking it did.

506
00:34:45,870 --> 00:34:48,790
Get your scrawny ass out of my sp...

507
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,570
you can fire me,ut, bitch,
don't think you can take me.

508
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:57,520
Have fun with your fan.

509
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:06,440
uh, excuse me. Sir, sir, um,
I'm supposed to be inside.

510
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:10,100
Um, I'm rayna's #1 fan. I was onstage.

511
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,700
Go around back. Ask for
a guy with a clipboard.

512
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,020
Look what you've done, rayna.

513
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,080
You messed it all up.

514
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:40,180
And I want to be able
to forgive you, but...

515
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:43,590
your actions lately...

516
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,220
who is this?

517
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,240
I came to get my stuff.

518
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,510
I thought something might
have happened to you, too.

519
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,600
What do you mean?

520
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:06,910
Seems like it wasn't such a good
idea to be seen out with rayna.

521
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:17,260
Why her? How is she your #1 fan?

522
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,130
You gave her what was mine.

523
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:24,850
And I know you said we could
never meet in person because it...

524
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:28,120
because it would diminish what we have.

525
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,630
It would ruin our moment.

526
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,730
Now, you will come meet me in person, and
i will not shoot this girl in the brains.

527
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,830
Lunatic.

528
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:41,210
I kill for you, you die for me.

529
00:36:41,250 --> 00:36:43,310
That was the deal.

530
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,440
I want to fulfill my part, rayna.

531
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,850
You have my number. Call me.

532
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:58,630
"Calme"?

533
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,940
You did this?

534
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:22,710
Ten years. Never done that.

535
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:29,050
She wanted this. All of it.

536
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,040
Otherwise, I never would have...

537
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,160
getting what you want may not
be the best thing for a person.

538
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:38,280
You're supposed to be with her.

539
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,240
She fired me.

540
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,330
Does that make a difference?

541
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,670
No.

542
00:37:47,950 --> 00:37:50,470
I don't know why, but...

543
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,510
even after everything
that's happened, I...

544
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,540
I have to help her.

545
00:38:05,970 --> 00:38:08,120
sierra has been kidnapped.

546
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:16,310
She drew his focus away from rayna.

547
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,860
- Well, that was a good call.
- Thank you.

548
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,150
Her handler's outside the location.
I told him to wait for our team.

549
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,410
Yes, that's best. Echo?

550
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,040
On task. Still protecting rayna.

551
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,440
Are you a fan, mr. Dominic?

552
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,540
- I'm sorry? - Rayna--
do you like her music?

553
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,810
I don't know if being a fan
has very much to do with that.

554
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:40,440
Not at the level we're dealing with.

555
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,800
No. Get the girl. Close it out.

556
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,340
Do it.

557
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,410
I don't want to.

558
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,760
You got to be near her.

559
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,540
To smell her.

560
00:39:10,550 --> 00:39:12,930
To touch her.

561
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,830
This... is your big day.

562
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,020
Your time to shine.

563
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,560
- I can't remember.
- Do it!

564
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,410
* Don't want to burst your bubble *

565
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,800
* don't want to waste your time *

566
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:43,380
* I got a feeling your
priorities are out of line *

567
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:48,790
* even though I know you're
trouble you're gonna do just fine *

568
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,350
* I got a feeling it's
time for you to shine *

569
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:56,640
* you're such a star
go on and take it away *

570
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:01,040
* go on and take it away *

571
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:05,140
* You'll play my heart with
every word that you say *

572
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:09,250
- * and toss it and tear it up, rip it...*
- no, no.

573
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,370
What are you doing

574
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,270
you scared me.

575
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,040
I scared you?

576
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,810
After all this, I scared you?

577
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,300
Why are you here? I fired you.

578
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:35,430
Look, I'm not here to fight, rayna.

579
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:37,010
I'm sorry for the things that I said.

580
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:39,190
I just want to know how I can help.

581
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,480
You can leave.

582
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:45,150
Then what are you gonna do?

583
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,840
The show must go on.

584
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,360
You can't be serious.

585
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:53,060
This isn't just about
you anymore, rayna.

586
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,420
Someone else is in danger.

587
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,920
We called the police.

588
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,390
What else do you want from me?

589
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,860
You know this guy.

590
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,230
You know what he's capable of.

591
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:05,500
You could stop him from hurting audra.

592
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,630
I can't stop him.

593
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,870
You could try.

594
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,640
She's your friend. She's a fan.

595
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,350
She'd want me to continue.

596
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:21,920
Rayna...

597
00:41:21,930 --> 00:41:27,010
I know you don't feel anything, or
think that you don't, but you will.

598
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,830
You will if you do
something to save this girl.

599
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:36,470
And you will help this girl.

600
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,970
What makes you think...

601
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:45,990
friends help each other out.

602
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,580
Clear.

603
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,450
Hi, fan #1.

604
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:02,770
My name is jordan. I have rayna.

605
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:05,460
I want to make an
exchange. No funny stuff.

606
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:08,230
I'll meet you where the original
plan was supposed to go down.

607
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,150
You can have her.

608
00:42:13,950 --> 00:42:15,300
What the hell's the matter with you?

609
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:18,560
Are you doing this on purpose
or you just terrible at your job?

610
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,780
Neither. Doing what?

611
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:23,990
Echo's off task. Your little
brainchild just backfired.

612
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,300
Okay, okay, first of all, wow.

613
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:31,080
Secondly, echo's hardwired
to protect the client.

614
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:34,630
Now, sometimes these things play
out differently than we anticipate.

615
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,280
You'd better check your tech!

616
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,310
That's enough!

617
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,590
You're in my house, lawrence!

618
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:43,240
Of the two people here,
one of us is a genius,

619
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:45,990
and the other is a security
guard in a very lovely suit.

620
00:42:46,010 --> 00:42:50,180
All right, genius, tell me why echo would
kidnap the girl you programmed her to protect

621
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,020
and bring her to the man
who's trying to kill her.

622
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:58,940
that does sound kind of bad.

623
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,950
you wanted to die.

624
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:10,370
This would be a "careful
what you wish for" moment.

625
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,330
Let her go.

626
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:15,140
And let her fall to her death?

627
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,590
But then I'd have
nothing to bargain with.

628
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:19,940
You drop her, and this girl will
have a big hole right in her head.

629
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,000
This girl for rayna now.

630
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,100
How about this?

631
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:31,100
You let audra go, throw the gun down
there, and I will hand you rayna.

632
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,250
You can do whatever you want with her.

633
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,680
Because, honestly, I
don't care if rayna lives.

634
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:39,910
She wants to die, and
you want to kill her.

635
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,880
So, basically, nobody wants
rayna to make it to tomorrow.

636
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,840
I do.

637
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:54,710
it's not about killing her.

638
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,490
It's about giving her what she wants.

639
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:01,070
Then this is a big, magical
moment for the two of you...

640
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,090
shut up!

641
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:07,520
you can't possibly understand
what we have together.

642
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:11,300
True. Maybe rayna can explain.

643
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:25,350
I'm so sorry. Please let me go.
I don't want to hurt anybody.

644
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:31,880
I'm sorry. No! Please! I'm sorry.

645
00:44:35,630 --> 00:44:37,810
In position. I have a clear shot.

646
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,290
We're ready to eliminate the threat.

647
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:43,130
Ma'am?

648
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:45,100
Not just yet.

649
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,050
I don't want to hurt anymore.

650
00:44:48,410 --> 00:44:50,560
That's really up to him.

651
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:54,740
- He decides your fate, right?
- No. Please. He's crazy.

652
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,130
I guess it's not love after all.

653
00:44:57,170 --> 00:44:58,950
She doesn't mean it then.

654
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,520
I'm sorry.

655
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,530
Rayna, I would never hurt you.

656
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:05,380
God, now you're
changing your story, too?

657
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:09,460
Shut up! I-I could kill
you and have both girls.

658
00:45:09,470 --> 00:45:12,920
- I could kill everybody.
- No!

659
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,450
- She doesn't seem to like that idea...
- shut up!

660
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,580
Shut up! I will shoot you.

661
00:45:17,590 --> 00:45:19,560
And then I'll let go.

662
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,850
You don't want to die.
You don't want her dead.

663
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:25,080
This is way too confusing.

664
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:54,630
Is rayna okay?

665
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,900
Please don't let me die.

666
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,760
I want to live!

667
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,630
I know.

668
00:46:08,590 --> 00:46:12,190
I will have quite the story to
tell when I get back to brisbane.

669
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,880
What do you mean? This is what
every day is like in america.

670
00:46:14,890 --> 00:46:20,020
Well, part of it was dreadful, but
it was by far the most exciting,

671
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:22,980
fulfilling, wonderful day of my life.

672
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,100
and you're the scariest one of all.

673
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:29,730
That's all I need:
You rubbing off on her.

674
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,600
Who the hell are you?

675
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:34,190
Audra, time for your treatment.

676
00:46:36,020 --> 00:46:38,370
What's wrong with him?

677
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,340
Are you ready for your treatment?

678
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,730
All right, but can I
kick that guy's ass first?

679
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,330
I will seriously consider it.

680
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,530
She's a risk. An increasing risk.

681
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,260
She had control over the situation.

682
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:51,730
But we can't control her.

683
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,560
I'm recommending that we
send echo to the attic.

684
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:58,410
Before someone else ends up dead, or
worse, she compromises this organization.

685
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:00,290
I believe she acted
in our best interest.

686
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:02,380
She went off mission!

687
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:05,310
In fact, I believe she
did quite the opposite.

688
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,100
She stopped the person
who wanted rayna dead.

689
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,130
It just happened to be rayna herself,

690
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,550
and by quite literally dangling
the threat of death in front of her,

691
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:16,850
she prevented rayna from ever being
a danger to herself in the future.

692
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:20,890
- Echo took the mission parameter...
- and did even better.

693
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:28,460
She seems to have the ability to think outside
of the pieces that we give her and then create.

694
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:31,340
Create a new approach to the problem.

695
00:47:31,370 --> 00:47:33,830
It's impressive.

696
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,800
I don't know what it
means, but it's impressive.

697
00:47:37,840 --> 00:47:40,250
She really is special.

698
00:47:40,690 --> 00:47:44,090
Special isn't always a
good thing here, boyd.

699
00:47:45,540 --> 00:47:47,320
Dewitt's a businesswoman.

700
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:49,780
Is she really gonna
harm her best active?

701
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:51,990
Echo wasn't always the best.

702
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,740
You're talking about alpha.

703
00:47:54,750 --> 00:48:00,860
I'm just saying sometimes the best
thing to hope for is good enough.

704
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:10,050
* I've got to find the
freedom that's promised me *

705
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:14,270
* freedom from our
struggles and our misery *

706
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:18,650
* freedom is all we need *

707
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:22,740
* to heal the pain of history *

708
00:48:22,750 --> 00:48:28,440
* I've got to find the
freedom that's promised me *

709
00:48:28,450 --> 00:48:32,760
* freedom from our
struggles and our misery *

710
00:48:32,770 --> 00:48:37,010
* freedom is all we need *

711
00:48:37,020 --> 00:48:41,020
* to heal the pain of history *

712
00:48:41,030 --> 00:48:45,580
* each day when the sun
shines upon my eyes *

713
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:49,660
* it fills me with love,
makes me feel alive *

714
00:48:49,670 --> 00:48:54,580
* I'm saving it up for a rainy day *

715
00:48:54,590 --> 00:48:58,040
* when there's no
light to guide my way *

716
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:03,620
* I got to find The
freedom that's promised me *

717
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:07,920
* freedom from our
struggles and our misery *

718
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:12,710
* freedom is all we need *

719
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:18,250
* to heal the pain of history.*
