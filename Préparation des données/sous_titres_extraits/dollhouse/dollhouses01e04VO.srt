00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,500
<i>Previously on Dollhouse:</i>

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,700
<i>In their resting state,</i>

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,700
<i>our Actives are as innocent
and vulnerable as children.</i>

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,400
We call it the tabula rasa-

5
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,100
<i>the blank slate.</i>

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,200
<i>Now imagine the imprint process
filling it,</i>

7
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,200
<i>creating a new personality.</i>

8
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,300
<i>A friend, lover.</i>

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,000
<i>And when the engagement
has been completed</i>

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,400
<i>all memory will be wiped clean.</i>

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,200
I try to be my best.

12
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,100
Why not default them
with, uh, ninja skills.

13
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,200
We tried that once.

14
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,800
<i>And?
Blood.</i>

15
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,300
<i>Screaming. Dying.</i>

16
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,400
<i>Alpha could have killed Echo
when he escaped,</i>

17
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,800
<i>but he left her alive.</i>

18
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,200
<i>So why didn't he kill Echo?</i>

19
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,300
Find out who's connected

20
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,300
to the Dollhouse

21
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,100
and you'll never see me again.

22
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,200
You don't know me, but I checked
you out plenty, Agent Ballard.

23
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,100
You don't close.

24
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:48,200
Hello, Victor.

25
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,800
Did I fall asleep?

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,300
What am I looking for?

27
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,500
The basement.

28
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,600
What do you know
about the Dollhouse?

29
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,600
I don't know what
you're talking about!

30
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,000
No one ever does.

31
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,500
Oh, God.

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
What is that?
Why is it beeping?

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,800
So,

34
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,000
who kissed
who first?

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,800
I don't know,
but... she did.

36
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,300
She kissed me.
He lunged at me

37
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,700
in the middle of a frat party.

38
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,700
Oh! Well, yeah, it was

39
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,200
because you, you know, you did
the little "kiss me" face.

40
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,500
He had one of those
sad, little

41
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,500
peach-fuzz goatee...

42
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,300
Now, I'm about to say something

43
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,300
that might scare you a little,
okay?

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,300
Okay.

45
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,200
Little Lucy

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,500
has linebacker shoulders.

47
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:47,800
So,

48
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,600
she's going to be a lesbian?

49
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,000
Big baby, narrow birth canal.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,700
That's causing her
some distress.

51
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,200
So, you and I have
some work to do, okay?

52
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,900
And you have to get ready
to hold your baby girl

53
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,000
'cause your wife's going to be
a little wiped out. Ready?

54
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,700
Okay.

55
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,100
Now... push.

56
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,900
Here's a promise:

57
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,000
all this scary,
painful stuff-

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
you won't even
remember.

59
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,500
I want to forget.

60
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,900
I want to forget!

61
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,700
Here comes your daughter.

62
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,500
I want to forget!

63
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,100
Hello, Echo.

64
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,200
How are you feeling?

65
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,400
Did I fall asleep?

66
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,000
For a little while.

67
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,600
Shall I go now?

68
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,800
If you like.

69
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,500
Good day.

70
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,500
I wasn't certain where to sit.

71
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,200
I swam 30 laps today.

72
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,600
Good for you.

73
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,500
I'm tired now.

74
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,500
It's important to exercise.

75
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,900
I try to be my best.

76
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,300
Are you?

77
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,900
Excuse me?

78
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,000
Are you your best?

79
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm... not sure
how to know that.

80
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,800
I think if you always try,

81
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,800
that's best.

82
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,300
right?

83
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,900
Every day is a chance
to be better.

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,500
They're eating lunch.

85
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,700
They're eating lunch
together, man friend.

86
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,900
Same three.

87
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,800
Even the same table.

88
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,100
They're grouping.

89
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,700
Are you saying
they remember each other?

90
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,800
No, no, no, no.

91
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,300
The wipes are clean.

92
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,500
This goes deeper than memory

93
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,000
into instinctual
survival patterns.

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,200
Flocking.

95
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,700
Whole mess of sparrows
turning on a dime.

96
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,500
Salmon trucking upstream.

97
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,300
This isn't a book club,
man friend.

98
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,900
This is the herd.

99
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,400
They're not bison, Topher.

100
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,900
They're a little bit bison.

101
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,500
Well, they didn't
used to be.

102
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,100
They volunteered
for this.

103
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,600
So we're told.

104
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,600
<i>The problem is not
insurmountable.</i>

105
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,700
What problem?

106
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,100
Upon review,

107
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,400
your engagement was flagged

108
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,600
as having certain
special requirements.

109
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,500
Before,

110
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,800
you tell me no one gets to know
what I'm asking for.

111
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
That's correct. However,

112
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,900
our computers do calculate
possible risks

113
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,500
to our Actives.

114
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,400
But you... you don't know.

115
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,100
No one knows the details
of your engagements

116
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,700
but you.

117
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,300
Excuse me.

118
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,800
I'm very sorry.

119
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
DeWitt.

120
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,700
Yes, sir, of course
I understand your concern.

121
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,500
Our main goal now
is to complete this matter

122
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,100
as quickly as possible.

123
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:22,200
Yes, the less time we give him
to spin his own theories,

124
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,500
the better, I think.

125
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
Well, he needs closure.

126
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,800
And we are the experts

127
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,500
at giving people what
they need, aren't we?

128
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,200
Yes, sir, I'll
keep you in...

129
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,500
formed.

130
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Good-bye.

131
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,000
I didn't offer you a drink.

132
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,800
Tea or something stronger?

133
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,500
These computers,

134
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,900
they say I have to pay more,
I pay more.

135
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,800
You're very understanding,
Mr. Diakos.

136
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
This way, please.

137
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,500
Judith will handle
the details.

138
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,200
It is not for me,
you know.

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,300
This night...

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,000
it is a gift.

141
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,800
You're a very
generous man.

142
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,200
Blue skies.

143
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,500
If I had an uncle

144
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,300
who'd get me her
for my bachelor party,

145
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:46,700
I'd get married, too.

146
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,100
She's very...

147
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,100
comfortable with herself,
isn't she?

148
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,600
Taffy, baby,
I'm going

149
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,000
to have fun with you tonight.

150
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,700
Anything you want.

151
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,400
It's all blue skies.

152
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,800
Gentlemen.

153
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,000
Ma'am.

154
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,000
Sir.
Perhaps

155
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,500
you'd like to take the party
up to your suite?

156
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,800
I'd be happy to send up

157
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
a complementary bottle
of champagne.

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Make it two bottles
and you got a deal.

159
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,500
Two bottles it is, sir.

160
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,300
Let's go!

161
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,800
Wait, wait for me.

162
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,700
Help!

163
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,300
Someone help me!

164
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,800
Please! I need help!

165
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,900
Taffy, come on!

166
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,700
We're just having a good
time! Somebody please!

167
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,000
Where is she?

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,400
Grab her, man!

169
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,800
Please! Help me!

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,900
They...

171
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:00,000
they hurt me.
Please!

172
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,300
Ah, crap.

173
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,500
It's okay.

174
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,400
You're safe now.

175
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,600
Where are we going?

176
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,900
I shouldn't be here.

177
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't worry.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
Those idiots
didn't follow us.

179
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
Even if they did...

180
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,600
nobody's getting through here.

181
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:34,800
See?

182
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,000
Everything's fine.

183
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,500
Why don't you
sit down?

184
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,100
That was not okay.

185
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,200
I mean, I know who I am,
and, and what I do,

186
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,500
but I didn't sign up for that.

187
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,600
And I really have to go.

188
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,900
Is there a backdoor?

189
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:52,400
I have somewhere to be.

190
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,500
What are you doing?

191
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,300
I understand you've had
a difficult evening, ma'am.

192
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,300
Yeah?

193
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,900
But we deeply regret any...

194
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,300
indignities you may
have suffered.

195
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,100
But it's hotel policy,

196
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,300
in these instances,
to offer a one-time

197
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,200
payment to, uh,
compensate you for...

198
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,100
You want me to let those freaks
off the hook.

199
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,300
Fine, they're off the hook.

200
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,700
I just want go.

201
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,000
You feel that way now.

202
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,800
But tomorrow, the next day,
you may change your mind.

203
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,500
We feel it's
in your best interest...

204
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,400
I'm leaving.

205
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Ma'am,
that's $10,000.

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,800
Now, all you
have to do

207
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,100
is sign this piece of paper

208
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,400
stating you will not pursue
legal action

209
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,700
against the hotel
or the guests in question...

210
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,900
and you walk away.

211
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,600
With...

212
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,300
that.

213
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,500
$10,000.

214
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,600
I just take your $10,000
and disappear?

215
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,900
Yeah.

216
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,000
You could be free.

217
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,800
You can go
anywhere.

218
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,000
No, thanks.

219
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,100
I just want you
to think about it.

220
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm in.

221
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,500
We're in position.

222
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,900
Door code's 489-374-83.

223
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,500
Blue skies.

226
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,400
They're called breasts.

227
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,500
And yes, they are
exceptional.

228
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,200
You can mention that
when you blog about this later.

229
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,600
Wants me to blog
about it?

230
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
So, boss, what do
we really call you?

231
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,600
You really

232
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,900
call me Taffy.

233
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,500
And the client's the boss.

234
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,500
He put together this
merry band of thieves.

235
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,900
In his infinite wisdom
he decided that...

236
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,700
well, guess I am
the boss of you.

237
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,800
Not taking him out's
your first mistake.

238
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,100
I figured out
on my first job

239
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,900
when a little "creative
thinking" on my part

240
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,600
almost got me not paid-

241
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,300
never second-guess
a client.

242
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,800
And wear comfy shoes.

243
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
Our client's paying
premium for no-kill.

244
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
He gets no-kill.

245
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,700
Okeydoke?

246
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,100
I- I think
you're hurting him.

247
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,000
You're very astute,
Professor.

248
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,500
It's a good thing
this is a no kill-job.

249
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,400
You could have been
in trouble there.

250
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,000
Uh, yeah, right.

251
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,600
Shouldn't we go far away now?

252
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,100
Here's how this is going to go.

253
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,800
In 64 seconds,

254
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,900
the high-security
building

255
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,600
on the other side
of that wall is going

256
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,500
to be shutting down
their motion sensors,

257
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,700
infrared sensors,
security cameras.

258
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,600
We will be in a Gray Hour.

259
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,300
In the one hour
it takes them

260
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:58,000
to revolutionize their security
system and make it impenetrable,

261
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
we penetrate.

262
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,900
Uh, excuse me.

263
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
If their system is down,

264
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,500
they must know
someone is going to try

265
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,000
and break in. That's six
seconds we can't get back.

266
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,600
Inside security:
five guards,

267
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,100
each with GPS tracking devices
implanted in their badges.

268
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,300
The guards will be focused
on perimeter threats.

269
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,500
They're not allowed on the vault
floor during Gray Hour.

270
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,100
For security reasons.

271
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,200
You have 'em yet?

272
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,800
Not till
we're inside.

273
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,200
The-the sensors
don't pick up any...

274
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
15 seconds.

275
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,500
You ready to go boom?

276
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,400
Ready.

277
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,000
We gotta sync
our watches...

278
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,200
Uh, sweetie.

279
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
You're on Taffy
Standard Time now.

280
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,300
And three, two, one.

281
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,700
Go.

282
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,600
A hundred people
must have heard this.

283
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,800
Upstairs, they're just thinking
a truck rumbled by.

284
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,200
I am the best, my man!

285
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,100
Bladdy, blah.

286
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,000
We're all the
best, braggy.

287
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,500
So pretty.

288
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,500
Hey, if she's the best,
funny I've never heard of her.

289
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,300
You've heard of Bonnie and Clyde, right?

290
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,100
Are you
Bonnie?

291
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,000
No.

292
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,700
I'm not that stupid.

293
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,700
Bonnie and her gun-crazy beau-

294
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,200
you know what they wanted?

295
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,100
It wasn't to be the best.

296
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:31,800
Best-ness means a quiet,
head-down kind of life.

297
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,800
No, Bonnie and Clydie-
they wanted fame.

298
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,200
Notoriety.

299
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,500
And boy,
did they get it.

300
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,600
They also got dead.

301
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,100
I'll pass on that.

302
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,500
When this is over,
feel free to forget I exist.

303
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,700
Now just keep it down

304
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:51,900
while this little darling and I
get to know each other better.

305
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,500
Uh, coming online.

306
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,200
Two secs.

307
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,400
I'll see the guards.

308
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,100
What?

309
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,700
She's in.

310
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,300
Damn!

311
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,900
damn

312
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,800
Tick-tock, boys.

313
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,400
Hey, this is...

314
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,300
Oh. Oh, my God.

315
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,800
There are rumors
of secret vaults

316
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,300
used by top museums

317
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,800
to store the world's most
controversial works, but...

318
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,300
Yeah. Piccolo Boy
here is shocking.

319
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,400
Yeah, Piccolo Boy,
as you call him,

320
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,500
was recently stolen from
a private collector in Paris.

321
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,300
Valued at $17 million.

322
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,500
Whatevs.

323
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,200
So, we're stealing
stolen art?

324
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,400
Well, some of these works

325
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,500
are merely
of questionable provenance.

326
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,500
Yeah, high-quality counterfeits.

327
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,200
Antiquities,
which are my particular forte...

328
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,200
Hey, old stuff expert?

329
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,000
Old stuff's in here.

330
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,400
Thank you, gods...

331
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,400
and goddesses.

332
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,000
Gray Hour's now Gray 45 minutes.

333
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,100
This is what
we're here for.

334
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,000
Find it, tell me
if it's the real thing,

335
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,900
so we can pack it up

336
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,000
and get the hell
out of here.

337
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,600
I thought it might be this.

338
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,400
Why else would I
have been chosen?

339
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Chosen for what?
What are we taking out of here?

340
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,100
The Parthenon.

341
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,700
Isn't that kind of big?

342
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,600
Don't do...
Don't shoot me.

343
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,800
How'd you get in here?

344
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,100
Your-Your locks are for crap.

345
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,400
Get out.

346
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
You got to help me.

347
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,900
Put me in Witness Protection.
Uh, get me out of town!

348
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,100
Just listen to me.

349
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,600
The last time I listened
to you, I got

350
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,900
a hole through the gut.
I- I didn't set you up!

351
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,300
You sent me to an ambush.

352
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,000
They were going to kill me!

353
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Who is she?

354
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,100
A pretty girl.

355
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,900
She is a pretty girl.
Pretty and lost.

356
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,300
You know lots of
girls like that.

357
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,100
Not her.

358
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:50,200
Is she the reason
they want me dead?

359
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,500
Her name's Caroline.

360
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,400
Bells ringing?!

361
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,300
No! I-I gave you a tip!

362
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,500
Somebody gives it to me,
I give it to you.

363
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,400
That's how it works!
Who gave you the tip?

364
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,600
Boom, you get shot,
my old, nice life, over.

365
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,300
I can't call my friends.
I can't go home.

366
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,000
I don't have any money.

367
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,300
Who gave you the tip?!

368
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,100
Was it her?!

369
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,900
A voice on the phone.

370
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,500
A- A man.

371
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,900
Not old, not young.

372
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,300
Uh, accent.

373
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,800
Sounded Georgian maybe.

374
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,100
Russian Georgia,
not Sweet Home Georgia.

375
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,700
Alabama.

376
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,200
Wh-What do I know?

377
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,200
It's confusing, this country.

378
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,400
The Borodins used me
to get to you.

379
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,700
That means they know
I talk to you, the FBI!

380
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,400
I am a dead man already

381
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,900
if you don't help me.

382
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
If I help you...

383
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,200
...I never hear
from you again.

384
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,200
Never. As in ever.

385
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,400
Never ever.

386
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,200
Stay here.

387
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,000
I'll see
what I can do.

388
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,100
And this is one
of the missing Elgin Marbles.

389
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,700
Yeah?

390
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,800
Okay, but we're looking
for a frieze fragment,

391
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,200
not a metope panel.

392
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,100
Over their heads, Professor.

393
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,100
The Elgin Marbles

394
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,000
are, uh,
large sections

395
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,100
of the Parthenon's marble

396
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,800
friezes and statuary,
stolen in the late 19th century.

397
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,400
<i>So we are stealing stolen art,
basically.</i>

398
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,300
Not technically.
You see, the Turks,

399
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,800
who controlled Athens
at the time-

400
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,100
they granted Thomas Bruce,
the Seventh Earl of Elgin,

401
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,000
permission to remove
the marbles, so, uh...

402
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,700
So, Greece hired us
to take this one back.

403
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,900
Client info is confidential.

404
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,500
Explains why we got hired
through middlemen.

405
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,200
And the no-kill order.
Things go bad,

406
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,800
they don't want some kind
of international incident.

407
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:41,300
When a client doesn't
say upfront who they are,

408
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,000
finding out's
usually not healthy.

409
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,600
How about we stop speculating?
All right.

410
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,500
The guards are rotating down
to the lower floors.

411
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,900
They're not
coming down here.

412
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,700
At least not for
the next 34 minutes.

413
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Better be right.

414
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:51,900
I am.

415
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,000
It's nothing personal-
his thing with you.

416
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,900
If I were in charge, he'd be
an ass with me, too, so...

417
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,500
Want to grab a drink
after this?

418
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,300
Ask me when we get out of here.

419
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,500
Will do.

420
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,600
Hey!

421
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,900
Where are you
going with that?

422
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,200
Hey!

423
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,600
No, don't!

424
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,700
Don't let

425
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,700
that close!

426
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,700
Stop the door!

427
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,200
Bastard!

428
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,300
Hey, are you okay?

429
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, peachy.

430
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,300
Over here.
You're gonna be fine.

431
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,800
I can get us
out of here.

432
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,600
The alarm come back up in...

433
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,900
In-In what?

434
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,900
31 minutes.

435
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,300
Not gonna be
a problem.

436
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,000
Just got
to make a quick call.

437
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,600
What's up?

438
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,300
It's me. How in the hell are
you getting reception down here?

439
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,000
I got a double-crosser
coming your way.

440
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,700
Probably the southwest corner
of the building.

441
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
He has what we came for.

442
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,700
Black bag.

443
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,200
You're gonna have
to complete this job for me.

444
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,600
I need a happy client.

445
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
I'm on it.

446
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,100
Everything all right in there?

447
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,200
We're locked in.

448
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,800
My tech guy's gonna
need medical,

449
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,300
but I'm fine,
and I can get us out,

450
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
which is irrelevant
if the job's a wash.

451
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,700
I'll finish the job.
Just get out of there.

452
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,900
Thanks. See you in a few.

453
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,500
Did I... fall asleep?

454
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,000
Neuromodulator is your friend.

455
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,900
And I don't mean friend
from kindergarten

456
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,300
you see twice a year.

457
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:47,000
Neuromod is your BFF.

458
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,700
Brain mapping requires...

459
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,400
Pizza squares, ice cream bites,
beef jerky?

460
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Okay, you may be

461
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:57,400
the boy-god of all things neuro,
and I do worship

462
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,500
at the altar
of your genius,

463
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
but I am not getting you
all this stuff.

464
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,600
Ivy, babe,

465
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,200
add juice boxes.

466
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,100
You're privilege-abusing.

467
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Do you want to know
how to avoid spandrels

468
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,400
when aligning rigid designators?

469
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,900
Grape or apple?

470
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,700
Humility is part of
the learning process.

471
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,000
I break you down.

472
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:20,200
Then I build
you back.

473
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,300
Topher.

474
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,500
Shall I go now?

475
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,500
What's wrong with her?

476
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,900
Hysterical woman
syndrome?

477
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,700
Five minutes ago,
you were kissing her ass.

478
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:34,400
Five minutes ago, we were
on Taffy Standard Time.

479
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,500
It's a private number.

480
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,000
It's not letting me
dial out.

481
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,500
Shall I go now?
Yeah.

482
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,900
Let's go! Get us
the hell out of here!

483
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,500
Do we know how long?

484
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,900
Not long enough.

485
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,400
I've dated my share
of crazies.

486
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,800
I know how to deal with this.

487
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,500
Hey.

488
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,400
I'm not saying this isn't cute.

489
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,700
It's adorable.

490
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,700
Shall I go now?

491
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,900
But the sooner
you open that door,

492
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,200
the sooner we can
go get that drink.

493
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,500
So let's do it.

494
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,600
Shall I

495
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,500
go now?

496
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,300
Now?

497
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,400
Ah. Boy.

498
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,500
Give me the bag.

499
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,200
Who are you?

500
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,000
The bag.

501
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,800
I can't do that.

502
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,400
Give...

503
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,000
me... the bag.

504
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,300
I've got a buyer who...

505
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,800
He pays me twice as much

506
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,000
as whoever, so...
Okay. Okay.

507
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:48,600
You and me-
we go in together, 50-50.

508
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,200
I'm gonna drop this. I'll shoot you.

509
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,100
This is the Parthenon.

510
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,200
The is a piece of the Parth...

511
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,000
Do you know
how much that's worth?

512
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,500
That's millions. That's...

513
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,700
I'm gonna turn it into dust,
I swear to God.

514
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,000
You drop it, I shoot you.

515
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,100
Then you don't get paid
or breathe.

516
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,200
Yeah. Okay.

517
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,400
You shot me.

518
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,400
Barely.

519
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,800
<i>I don't know where Boyd is.</i>

520
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,600
Handler Man is MIA,
and Echo's vitals are...

521
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,700
Th-This is a chart?

522
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,600
They're off it.

523
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,400
Boyd checked in with Central
eight minutes ago.

524
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
Apparently,
a member of Echo's crew

525
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,200
absconded
with the target item

526
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,900
and locked the rest
of the team in the vault.

527
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,700
Explains the change in vitals.

528
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,600
This is a special skills
felony engagement.

529
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,500
I wove more
than one thread

530
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,000
of unflappable
into that tapestry.

531
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,300
Okay?

532
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,700
Echo could have
an exploding belly bomb,

533
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,400
and her heart rate shouldn't
go past 65 beats a minute.

534
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,200
Maybe you made a mistake
in the programming.

535
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:58,300
Something's wrong.

536
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,600
I'll initiate contact.

537
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,400
Echo's not picking up her cell.

538
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,800
You reached out to an Active

539
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,600
during an engagement
without my say-so?

540
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
It's the adrenaline.

541
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,700
It makes me forget
my protocols and "q"s.

542
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,800
Echo was talking to Boyd

543
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,200
when her vitals spiked.

544
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,300
Which is irrelevant
if the job's a wash.

545
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,600
I'll finish the job.
Just get out of there.

546
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,300
Thanks. See you in a few.

547
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,100
What was that?

548
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Play it again.

549
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,900
I'll finish the job.
Just get out of there.

550
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Thanks. See you in a few.

551
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,500
That's not...

552
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,200
That didn't happen.

553
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,300
How do I know
that didn't happen?

554
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:41,600
<i>Because that
can't happen.</i>

555
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,600
Topher,

556
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,200
what can't happen?

557
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,300
???

558
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,400
I'm pretty sure...

559
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,300
I'm kind of positive,
actually, that

560
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,500
something happened.

561
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:54,900
The exact same thing happened,
except without the chair.

562
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,600
You've stated that remote wipes
aren't possible.

563
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,800
I've said they're untested.

564
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,900
I've said they're
a very bad, bad idea.

565
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,000
I've said I can't do them.

566
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,300
How do we undo it?

567
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,900
We... don't?

568
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,000
Somebody out there
figured out our frequency,

569
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,100
hacked into our call,

570
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,800
and that's not even
the hard part.

571
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,700
I mean, we're talking
about someone...

572
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,600
I could not have
seen this coming!

573
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
This is not my fault!

574
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,500
All right.

575
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,900
We'll parcel out
the blame later.

576
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,900
What matters now is
the reputation of this company.

577
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,600
We have an engagement
to complete.

578
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,100
I'll confirm that Boyd
retrieved the target item.

579
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
About Echo,

580
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,400
how bad is it?

581
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,500
Being wiped is not
unlike being born.

582
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,800
It's traumatic.

583
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,300
I mean, in here,
we minimize the trauma

584
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,600
with throw pillows
and perfectly crunchy lettuce.

585
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,000
There's no conflict.

586
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,300
But out there it's all...

587
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:50,000
fluorescent lights and forceps.

588
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,500
Right now,

589
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,000
Echo is experiencing

590
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,600
extreme sensory overload.

591
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,900
That could lead to a coma state.

592
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,800
Or it could turn her
into "Carrie at the prom. "

593
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,200
Either way...

594
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,300
we have to help her.

595
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,500
She can't help herself.

596
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,100
Okay...

597
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,300
now you say it.

598
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,400
I'm Taffy.

599
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,400
And...

600
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,300
I know how to get us
out of here.

601
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,800
Yeah, good.

602
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,900
What else?

603
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,000
I try to be my best.

604
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,600
<i>You are the best.</i>

605
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,300
You remember? Bonnie and Clyde?

606
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,600
Are they here, too?

607
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,300
Okay, all right,

608
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,800
let's rewind a few minutes.

609
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,400
You were talking on this.

610
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,900
I was talking on this.

611
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,500
You were talking and you said

612
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,300
that you could
open the door.

613
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:47,300
I know how to open the door.

614
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Yes, good.

615
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,500
So, open it.

616
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
I try to be my best?

617
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
Yeah...

618
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,000
Taffy's gone, man.

619
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,500
And she's not coming back.

620
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,000
Hello, Taffy.

621
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,100
I'm Adelle DeWitt.

622
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,800
I need your help.

623
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,300
Blue skies.

624
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,600
Lots of people would die
to see this stuff.

625
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,600
Now it looks like
we're going to.

626
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,900
This one's broken.

627
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,600
Yeah, look who's talking.

628
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,100
On the inside.

629
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:45,600
So, you like... art?

630
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,100
It doesn't look right.

631
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,700
It's not about looking right.

632
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,600
Art's about feeling right

633
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:57,300
and you... have no idea

634
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,100
what I'm talking about.

635
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,700
She makes me feel...

636
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,200
funny.

637
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,900
Well, that's 'cause
these other guys...

638
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,200
they painted what they saw.

639
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,500
But this guy,

640
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,100
he painted what is.

641
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,400
That's what art's for:

642
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:19,100
to show us who we are.

643
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,200
This one- it's saying
how we start off whole,

644
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
then somewhere along the line,

645
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,400
the pieces start to slide.

646
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,300
We get broken.

647
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,600
That's sad.

648
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,400
No, it's weak.

649
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,700
You can either get broken,

650
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,900
or you can be the one
doing the breaking.

651
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,600
No mystery
which way you went.

652
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,900
<i>Ten months of research.</i>

653
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,600
Blueprints, security systems,

654
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,300
police response time.

655
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,000
The Parthenon job
was supposed to be mine.

656
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,300
And now it is.

657
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,400
You were running
two ponies all along.

658
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,400
It was the client's decision.

659
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,200
Hey, I figured out
on my first job,

660
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
when a little creative
thinking on my part

661
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
almost got me not paid:

662
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,700
never second-guess a client.

663
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,100
And wear comfy shoes.

664
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,800
But I learned how to lap-dance.

665
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:22,600
We'll pay double your usual fee
to extract the team.

666
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,900
Getting sidelined by some girl

667
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,800
at the last minute-

668
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,500
my feelings are hurt.

669
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,700
I assure you that
Echo is not "some girl. "

670
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,600
You and she are cut

671
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,800
from the same cloth.

672
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,100
I've never gotten amnesia
during a gig,

673
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,600
but whatevs.

674
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,500
Three of your peers
are locked in that vault

675
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,800
with nothing between them

676
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,700
and a SWAT team but you.

677
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,400
There is no balm
for a bruised ego

678
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,400
like saving the day.

679
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
I'll need to see the cash.

680
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,700
We're a bit pressed for time.

681
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,700
Of course.

682
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,400
This remote wipe,

683
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,800
it's not about
just creating

684
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,100
five seconds of noise.

685
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,600
He had to break into our system,
which is impossible.

686
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,800
He had to get
Echo's cell number.

687
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,300
He, uh...
Or she.

688
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,400
Or they.

689
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
It has to be a "they. "

690
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,300
I mean, look at this build.

691
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,700
It's not even science. It's art!

692
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,600
You saw the firewalls.

693
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,000
There are many.

694
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,600
I defy another

695
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,300
programmer
to put that much

696
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
neurotrophic factor
around each and every

697
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,800
personality component.

698
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,400
This isn't a lone gunman.

699
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,000
This is a conspiracy.

700
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,100
A gigantic,

701
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,800
multi-pronged, conspiracy.

702
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,600
You need to take something.

703
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,700
What is it, Topher?

704
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,800
When you took Echo out tonight,
did she seem normal?

705
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,300
Yeah, why?

706
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,000
You don't know.

707
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,800
What's going on?

708
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,900
Echo's been wiped.

709
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,000
Remotely.

710
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,200
What?

711
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,800
It's not my fault.

712
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,500
Mr. Langton.

713
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,800
I talked to Topher.

714
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,500
If there were anything
you could do,

715
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,900
I'd already have you doing it.

716
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,100
I didn't think remote wipes
were even possible.

717
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,200
Neither did we.

718
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,400
You retrieved the target item?
Yeah, I got it.

719
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,300
So, how are you planning on

720
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
getting her out of there?
We're working the problem.

721
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,400
What does that mean?

722
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:30,600
It means I'm hopeful
of a happy outcome.

723
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,400
And if the outcome isn't happy?

724
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,900
Then you should
prepare yourself.

725
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,200
The crew's access point
to the vault.

726
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,000
Where is it?

727
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,300
Uh, a security office.

728
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,600
Draw me a map.

729
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,100
The place is a maze!

730
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,800
I don't remember... Try.

731
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,400
How?

732
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,300
As if your life depended on it.

733
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,500
We believe,
with the right equipment,

734
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,200
you could get inside
the building through the roof.

735
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,300
Oh, sweetie.

736
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,800
Equipment's not the issue.

737
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,300
The Gray Hour's going
to end in nine minutes.

738
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:10,100
We won't even make it
out of the parking garage.

739
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,500
But if this Echo chick
is as good as you say,

740
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,300
brain fry aside,

741
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,500
I don't need to get inside.

742
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,600
All I need is a phone.

743
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,000
I like sky.

744
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Yeah, the blue kind.

745
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,500
You mentioned.

746
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:29,600
That's a mountain.
Yep.

747
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,500
What's my name?

748
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,900
Taffy.

749
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,500
When I'm there,

750
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,000
my name is something else.

751
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,000
Hand me that bag.

752
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,200
What are you looking for?

753
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,800
A way out of here.

754
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,900
Not to play with.

755
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,500
There's an air duct back here.

756
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,300
He's gonna find
a way out of here.

757
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,800
Vitas isn't gonna open
that door.

758
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,200
And I'm not gonna open
that door.

759
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,100
And you're definitely
not gonna open that door.

760
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
They are gonna open the door.

761
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,600
They're gonna
take us to Prison.

762
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,500
What's prison?

763
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,600
It's a place with no sky.

764
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:41,700
We're bad guys.

765
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,300
When bad guys get caught,

766
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,400
we don't get to see sky.

767
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,200
I'm a bad guy?

768
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,400
You...

769
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,600
are a talking cucumber.

770
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:55,900
And I'm...

771
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,800
too broken to fix.

772
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,100
Oh, no, no, no.

773
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,700
You don't get to take
the easy way out!

774
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,600
I'm lifting the no-kill order.

775
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,900
When those doors open...

776
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,200
we're shooting our way out.

777
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,600
Yuma Takahashi.

778
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:20,200
You think he's one of the prongs
in the multi-pronged conspiracy?

779
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
He's always gunning for my job.

780
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,200
He loves the beach.

781
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,700
Here.

782
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,300
You really think
a programmer in Tokyo

783
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,500
is going to remote-wipe Echo
in Los Angeles

784
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,300
to steal your job?

785
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,000
He shows DeWitt his mad skills,

786
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,200
suddenly Topher's
no longer "Number One Son. "

787
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,100
Echo could die.

788
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:43,300
That is not a plan
for career advancement.

789
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,500
Anyway, Takahashi's a hack.

790
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,100
There's only
one person

791
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,700
I know who could achieve
a remote wipe.

792
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,400
And he's dead.

793
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,400
You know, this only works
if she answers.

794
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,600
Dial again.

795
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,000
Keep dialing.

796
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,800
I'd like to go over
the plan again.

797
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,100
Nervous Nellie.

798
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,000
He's actually kinda sweet.

799
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Okeydoke.

800
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,100
The vault door contains a whole
mess of glass re-lockers.

801
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,700
If somebody, me say,

802
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,800
drills through the door
from the inside,

803
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,900
the glass breaks.

804
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,000
Presto, alarm goes off.

805
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,900
Whole other mess of locks
are released.

806
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,300
No getting out.

807
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,700
You bypass the glass.

808
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,700
Resin.

809
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,600
Makes it crack
rather than shatter.

810
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,400
If you do it right.

811
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,100
Well, this is
about to be

812
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,100
a giant anticlimax.

813
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,200
Ten, nine, eight...

814
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,700
Dial again.

815
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:39,900
seven, six, five...

816
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:42,200
four, three...

817
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,400
Two?
One.

818
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,000
It's over.

819
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,300
I don't like this room anymore.

820
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,500
Where are the better rooms?

821
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,600
I have something
in my pocket.

822
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,700
Look.

823
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,700
It's over.

824
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,100
It's almost over.

825
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,100
The security system's
going back online

826
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,500
one device at a time.

827
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,300
The vault door,
then the heat sensors,

828
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,900
then the motion detectors.

829
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,700
Hello?

830
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,500
If I can get the vault door open

831
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
before the motion detectors
reactivate,

832
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,700
we're all good.

833
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,200
Is this the chowderhead?

834
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,300
I don't know.

835
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,100
Clearly, yes.

836
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,500
Here's the dealio.

837
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,300
I can get you out of that vault

838
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,500
if you do exactly as I say.

839
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,200
Can you do that?

840
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,900
I think so.

841
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,200
Underwhelming,
but let's give it a go.

842
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:32,900
You should be carrying

843
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,500
a vial of resin.

844
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,400
Bra's a good place.

845
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,200
I have it!

846
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,100
Then you've also
got a nozzle thingy

847
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,200
tucked into your boot.

848
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,700
Lipstick-like.

849
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:49,600
Yes!

850
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,800
Screw one thingy

851
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,900
onto the other thingy.

852
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,400
And you're gonna need a drill.

853
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,700
She says we need a drill.

854
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,900
Who's "she"?

855
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,000
I don't know.

856
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
But I'd give Taffy the drill.

857
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,900
This is fun.

858
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,200
Are you having fun?

859
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,100
No.

860
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,600
Go to the door.

861
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,500
You'll want both hands.

862
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:20,600
On three,
start drilling into the door.

863
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,900
Doesn't matter where.

864
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:22,900
Ready.

865
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:25,200
I'm going to close my eyes
and pray to God

866
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,600
<i>that when I say stop,
you will stop.</i>

867
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,200
One... two...

868
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,600
three... drill.

869
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,500
And stop.

870
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:42,200
Spray the resin into the hole-
three squirts.

871
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Count 'em out.

872
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,600
One, two,

873
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,000
three.

874
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,200
Put the drill in the hole.

875
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,500
Turn it on.

876
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,600
Now, this is the important part.

877
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,800
Do not move your hand.

878
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,300
Don't think about it.

879
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,900
Do it.

880
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,100
Is that good?

881
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,000
Chowderhead!

882
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,100
Talk to me.

883
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,200
This wouldn't have happened

884
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,700
if you didn't
give my job away.

885
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:31,700
What's the police response time?

886
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,500
Seven minutes.

887
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,200
Guards inside, less.

888
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,700
Six minutes, 15 seconds less.

889
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,800
You stupid bitch!

890
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,700
Taffy, thank you
for your services.

891
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:49,700
That's it?

892
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,600
Mr. Dominic will take you
down for your treatment.

893
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,900
Thanks for the cash.

894
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,400
Good luck with the girl.

895
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,500
I'll notify Boyd.

896
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,500
He may have to
neutralize her.

897
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,500
No.

898
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,400
I'm beginning to suspect he
hasn't the proper distance.

899
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,700
Send down for
Ramirez and Hutchins.

900
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,100
Put them
on standby.

901
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,800
I'm sorry.

902
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,000
Me, too.

903
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,700
Don't go anywhere
with that.

904
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,400
I've got my eye on you.

905
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,000
Echo?

906
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,000
This may pinch.

907
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,400
The guards are closing in.

908
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
Remember,

909
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,600
your hands go
over your head.

910
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
Okay.

911
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,500
Why?

912
00:39:58,900 --> 00:39:59,600
don't want

913
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,600
the guards to put a bullet
in your chest.

914
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,300
Don't listen to him.
Take this.

915
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,900
Get up.

916
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,500
Point it
at the bad guys

917
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,100
and you squeeze
the trigger.

918
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Aren't we the bad guys?

919
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,500
Down.

920
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,800
Remember what I told you?

921
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,100
You get broken
or you do the breaking.

922
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,500
Come out slowly!

923
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,200
Let me see
your hands!

924
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,200
Let's go!

925
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,100
Start shooting

926
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,200
now...

927
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,700
or I shoot you.

928
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,300
I'd like to go now.

929
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,700
Let's see
your hands!

930
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,100
There's no way out!

931
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,400
Drop the weapon!

932
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:47,900
Do it.

933
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:50,200
Building perimeter
is locked down!

934
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,400
Hands on your head!

935
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,000
Do it now!
What are you waiting for?

936
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,000
Do it!

937
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,900
Around the corner...

938
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,400
you can get out.

939
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Go.

940
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,500
Go now;
they won't be able

941
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,700
to see you.

942
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,500
Are you okay?

943
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,000
He's broken.

944
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,100
Can we fix him?

945
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
We'll try.

946
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:05,400
I'm not broken.

947
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,200
No, you're not.

948
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,000
Come on.

949
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,300
Let's get
out of here.

950
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,500
What took you
so long?

951
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,400
There's a car out there.

952
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,000
Two guys, motor on,
15 minutes at least.

953
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,600
This is West Hollywood.

954
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,000
Two guys in an idling
car isn't news.

955
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,400
So, who am I going to be?

956
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,600
Uh, John Smith, maybe?

957
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,700
I got a good American accent.

958
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:42,700
You're gonna be Anton Lubov.

959
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:45,300
I d... I don't get it.
I may have misled you

960
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:46,900
about the "me
helping you. "

961
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,000
I needed you to stay put
while I put you front and center

962
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,000
on every "be on the lookout"
list from here

963
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,200
to New York.

964
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,600
If you try to
leave Los Angeles

965
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,000
by plane, train,
or automobile,

966
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,200
the FBI is going
to be all over you.

967
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,900
We won't be discreet.

968
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,500
I'll personally drop you off
at the Borodins' doorstep,

969
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,300
make sure they know
we're friends.

970
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,700
Are you crazy?

971
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,400
You want me to die?

972
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,600
I don't want you to
die, but if you do,

973
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,400
there's a lot to learn
from a dead body.

974
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,300
I know how the
Russians kill.

975
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,700
I know their
favorite weapons.

976
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,400
I know where to look
for bruises.

977
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,000
I know which body parts
they like to chop off

978
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,600
and what message they
want a body to send.

979
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,000
I tried to help you.

980
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,100
If your body
turns up

981
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,600
and tells a different story,

982
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:35,200
well, then that'll give me
information, too.

983
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,300
The FBI doesn't work like that.

984
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,500
You ca...

985
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,900
you can't do this.

986
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:43,700
I'm a screw-up, remember?

987
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,800
My CI shows up dead,
nobody's going to blink.

988
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,600
Nobody's going to care.

989
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,300
You put on your mean
face, act tough,

990
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,400
but you will care,
Agent Ballard.

991
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,300
That's your problem.

992
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,100
I'm not broken.

993
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:16,700
Around the corner,
you can get out.

994
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,100
What are you waiting for?
Do it!

995
00:44:20,100 --> 00:44:21,300
<i>Aren't we the bad guys?</i>

996
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:22,700
<i>Bitch!
Is that good?</i>

997
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,700
<i>No, it's weak.</i>

998
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:25,700
You either get broken or you can
be the one doing the breaking.

999
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,100
That's what art's for:

1000
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:28,500
<i>to show us who we are.</i>

1001
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,100
<i>This one's broken.</i>

1002
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,200
Did I fall asleep?

1003
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,200
Hello, Echo.

1004
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:46,400
How are you feeling?

1005
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,300
Did I fall asleep?

1006
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,900
Michelangelo believed his
sculptures already existed

1007
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:57,300
inside the marble,
waiting to be freed.

1008
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,600
We should get this
to our clients

1009
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:01,900
first thing
in the morning.

1010
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:03,800
And the
antiquities expert?

1011
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,700
They can have him, too.

1012
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,200
So... I put Echo through
every test I could think of,

1013
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,400
which is a lot.

1014
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,900
The remote wipe didn't do any
permanent damage, so...

1015
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,500
Whatever happened...

1016
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:28,900
in Echo's head
in that vault-

1017
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,500
it's gone?

1018
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,300
She's fresh
as morning dew.

1019
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,500
No pesky human evolution bits
lingering around.

1020
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:38,800
Well done.

1021
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:42,300
I believe Victor has completed
his debriefing.

1022
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:44,600
He's ready to be wiped.

1023
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,500
It was Alpha, wasn't it?

1024
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,100
Nobody else
could come even close

1025
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,200
to pulling off a remote wipe.

1026
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,100
He's alive.

1027
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:57,400
He's out there.

1028
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:02,200
You'll need to sign
and initial at the bottom.

1029
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,600
Is this...?

1030
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,200
Am I fired?

1031
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,500
I'm upping your
security clearance.

1032
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,000
Does that mean... I'm right?

1033
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,000
Alpha's alive?

1034
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,600
He's out there?

1035
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,400
But after the... incident,

1036
00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:27,000
you told us security tracked him
down and, you know...

1037
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,500
Our influence is
substantial,

1038
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,600
but Alpha, with his gifts-
gifts we gave him-

1039
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,700
finding him, confining him-

1040
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,400
we're not all-powerful.

1041
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,300
I'm scared.

1042
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,700
I'm scared like a little girl.

1043
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,800
Sign and initial
at the bottom.

1044
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,700
I'll tell you what
I know about Alpha.

1045
00:46:56,300 --> 00:46:58,000
You'll tell me
how he did this

1046
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,800
and how we can keep him
from ever doing it again.
