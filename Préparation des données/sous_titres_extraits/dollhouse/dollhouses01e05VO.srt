********

00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,150
******

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:08,930
You have the money.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,460
It would've been polite to ask.

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,710
You have to get used to
doing things my way,too.

6
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:16,630
See,these personality imprints,
they come from scans of real people.

7
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,790
Keep it down.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,750
While this little darling and
I get to know each other better.

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,800
Wow,she's in.

10
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:25,100
Hey,neighbor. Off early?

11
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,740
Ooh,who's she?

12
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,350
Nobody,according to the FBI database.

13
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,600
What the hell's the matter with you?

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,480
Your little brainchild just backfired.

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:44,150
******

16
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,280
Excuse you.

17
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,370
Are you gonna pick that up?

18
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,160
* Oh,how sweet to walk *

19
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,400
* In this pilgrim way *

20
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,230
I'm talking to you! What,are
you deaf? Or you just tone deaf?

21
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,540
Jesse,not in my shop,please.

22
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,790
Not in your shop?

23
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,350
They wouldn't be in your shop
if you refused to serve them.

24
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,480
No.

25
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:04,080
You know what they're doing
up there on that compound.

26
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,770
No,I don't. Neither do you.

27
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,830
You just don't want to know.

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:14,300
Osama Bin Ghandi. Huh,what
do you need that for,huh?

29
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,620
Or this?

30
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,350
Look at me! Look at
me when I talk to you!

31
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:25,460
All right,all right,enough!
Get out of my store,Jesse.

32
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,530
- Trouble?
- No.

33
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,500
No trouble.

34
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,500
It's weird. Their
money spends just fine.

35
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:53,560
It's not so much the
singing as it is the smiling.

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,570
What do you figure that's all about?

37
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,140
Maybe they're just happy,Phil.

38
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,040
Yeah,maybe.

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,340
<i>SAVE ME</i>

40
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,000
Happy? No,this is something
quite apart from happiness.

41
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:16,880
Call it a kind of bliss,
an unquestioning serenity.

42
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,160
True happiness requires some
measure of self-awareness.

43
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,440
We're talking about people here who
have their very wills taken away.

44
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,550
Imagine such a thing.

45
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,850
The irony of bringing this to you,Adelle,
is not lost on me, I promise you.

46
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,270
It's not the irony that concerns me.

47
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,920
You're asking me to place an
Active with a federal agency.

48
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,150
Indirectly,yes.

49
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,160
I don't wish to be vulgar, but one of the
many benefits of having you as a client

50
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,770
is that you help us avoid
entanglements with federal agencies.

51
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,790
Senator.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,150
It's the ATF.

53
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,230
You been running guns?

54
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,680
Besides,your Active won't be
working with the government.

55
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,730
One of your security guys would liaise.

56
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,390
Your Active would be perfectly safe.

57
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,500
In a fanatical religious cult.

58
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,770
Adelle...

59
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,660
This is an election year.

60
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,260
I got the family value
voters on the right,

61
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,900
the women's issues constituency
on the left all coming after me

62
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:15,530
if anything untoward is going
on behind those compound walls.

63
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,370
The ATF is convinced there is.

64
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,200
Now,we have a very narrow
window on this warrant.

65
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,860
If the government sends in some
wet-behind-the-ears Quantico undercover graduate,

66
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:29,310
these people are gonna know about it.

67
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,020
I need the real thing.

68
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,970
I need a true believer.

69
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:37,510
- I can't help you.
- You're the only one who can.

70
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,580
Aren't you supposed to be shot?

71
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,570
I lived.

72
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,410
I see that. Shouldn't
you be recuperating?

73
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,330
Come on,Loomis. You scan the
face, you look for a match.

74
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,580
Computer does all the work.

75
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,590
Have Carter run it through NCIC.

76
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,800
I already did that.

77
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,530
- And you didn't get a match?
- Nothing.

78
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,910
Well,I don't know what
you expect me to do.

79
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:58,660
We both know your clearance rating opens
up databases Carter can only dream about.

80
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,120
Then you know that I've got plenty of faces to
scan for people much more impressive than you.

81
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,880
But not as charming.

82
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:08,000
Was that flirting?

83
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:10,360
I think so. It's been a while.

84
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,600
Did I mention I was shot?

85
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,860
I don't like it.

86
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:23,490
Good,it's your job not to like it, Mr. Dominic, but
Senator Boxbaum is more than just a valued client.

87
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,780
He's a well-placed asset.

88
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:27,550
Denying his request would have a
steeper downside than acquiescing.

89
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,110
It's not the job. I'm confident
Langton can handle the ATF. It's Echo.

90
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:34,300
Her field response has
been wildly erratic lately.

91
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,390
She's demonstrated a...

92
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,710
talent for adaptability, which is
precisely what is required in this instance.

93
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,090
They shouldn't be adaptable.
They should be predictable.

94
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,470
If Alpha didn't teach us that much.

95
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,880
You don't like Echo, do you,Mr. Dominic?

96
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,370
It's not that I don't like her.

97
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:51,360
It's that sometimes I worry you do.

98
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,330
Your objections have been
noted. Thank you,Mr. Dominic.

99
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,240
- Hello,Echo.
- Hello.

100
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,960
I had an exam.

101
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,790
That's good. Would you
like to have some lunch now?

102
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
I would.

103
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,760
She shouldn't eat.

104
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,830
Not before the surgery.

105
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,220
Echo, why don't you go have a massage?

106
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:17,880
A massage would be relaxing.

107
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,540
If she were any more
relaxed,she'd be ooze.

108
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,210
So,it's doable?

109
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:28,690
It's... experimental.
And highly invasive.

110
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,850
But doable?

111
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,670
The actual procedure isn't much more
complicated than laser eye correction.

112
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,890
It ain't brain surgery.

113
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,590
Actually,it is brain surgery.

114
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,300
We're going to be turning Echo into a
human camera, and in order to do that,

115
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,410
she's going to have to be made blind.

116
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,350
Not permanently.

117
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:47,420
In theory.

118
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,560
So,this is it?

119
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,700
Yes,uh,the latest in CSEVP.

120
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,290
Cortical stimulation for
evocation of visual perception.

121
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,980
Brain camera for the blind.

122
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,550
Or that.

123
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,910
And this is what she'll be seeing?

124
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:06,340
Well,this is what the feds will be seeing,
only less clear once we get it inside of Echo.

125
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:08,510
We'll be using her eyes as lenses.

126
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:14,400
The images will bypass her own cortex
and be broadcast directly back to the ATF.

127
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,340
Echo herself will see no evil.

128
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:23,690
There have been instances of this technology
causing aneurysms and,in one case,death.

129
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,800
It's possible one good sneeze
could bring on a seizure.

130
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,120
Or even worse--
a sneezure.

131
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:33,870
The risks have been determined
to be within acceptable margins.

132
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,290
How soon can she be ready?

133
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,030
I'll need 24 hours.

134
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:43,200
Good. Clock starts now. Thanks.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,050
{\a6}*******

136
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,960
This is our target. Calls
himself Jonas Sparrow.

137
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,510
Real name: Nathan Allan White.

138
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,240
36 years of age, spent most of
those years in federal prisons.

139
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,960
Last time he was inside, Sparrow
claimed a conversion experience.

140
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,990
Upon release,he joined
up with the Zion Ranch.

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,580
Formed a splinter group.

142
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,790
They grew in number...
and set up shop here.

143
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,100
What kind of shop?

144
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,440
Given Sparrow's history, it could be anything
from gun running to human trafficking.

145
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,130
One thing I can promise you: he is not
up at that ranch putting hay in a manger.

146
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,720
Our problem has been we haven't been
able to show cause for a warrant.

147
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,540
Until now.

148
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,620
Sparrow never leaves
the compound himself.

149
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,350
But once a month, he sends some
minions into town to buy supplies.

150
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,140
They go in groups to watch each other.

151
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,930
Well,someone wasn't
watching closely enough

152
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:39,920
because one of the faithful managed to
scribble this on the back of a shopping list.

153
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,460
"Save me."

154
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,580
These two words have
opened a crack in the door.

155
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:47,610
A very small crack.

156
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:50,280
A judge has agreed to let
us do a sneak-and-peek.

157
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:53,840
We have 48 hours to show
cause for further action.

158
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,560
Then the door shuts again.

159
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:57,870
48 hours to penetrate a closed group?

160
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,620
To gain their confidence, to get inside?

161
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,080
I'd like you all to meet Boyd Langton.

162
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,700
Private contractor recommended
to us by Senator Boxbaum.

163
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,980
He's been vetted at the highest level.

164
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:12,430
I'll let him tell you what he does.

165
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,990
Hi,so,what I do is I work with
an extraordinary young woman.

166
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,430
She's not a law enforcement officer.

167
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,150
She's not an undercover
agent. She's just a girl.

168
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:25,680
And she's going to help us.

169
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:29,200
Her name is Esther Carpenter,
and she knows these people.

170
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,170
She knows them like she knows herself.

171
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,630
Did she escape from a cult?

172
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:36,770
No.

173
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,700
She didn't escape from anything.

174
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:46,930
Esther's talent is not in
getting out, but getting in.

175
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,560
And because of this talent, because of
who she is, that is what she will do.

176
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,450
She will not arrive there
a stranger or an intruder.

177
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:06,370
She will walk through the gates of that
compound, and she will be accepted as one of them.

178
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,090
How?

179
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,260
Through a miracle.

180
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,300
I can feel the sun.

181
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,950
We're headed south
now. You made the turn.

182
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,160
It means we're getting closer.

183
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:24,840
I really want to thank you
for going out of your way.

184
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,800
It's not as far out of
my way as you might think.

185
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:31,000
I admire your courage.
Hitchhiking across country.

186
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,770
Because I'm blind?

187
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,350
Nah,'cause you're a girl.

188
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,840
I'm a girl?

189
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:39,880
Wow,I've been blind
longer than I thought.

190
00:10:41,130 --> 00:10:42,580
Do I hear a smile?

191
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,980
You do.

192
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,050
So,you weren't always blind?

193
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,630
No,the Lord saw fit to take
my vision when I was nine.

194
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,320
The Lord,huh? And you don't blame him?

195
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,120
Blame him? No,I praise Him.

196
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:03,040
Saul of Tarsus made it all the way to Damascus after
he was struck blind, and he became a new person.

197
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,110
You want to become a new person?

198
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,610
More than anything.

199
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,700
Are we here?

200
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:17,430
I think so.

201
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,900
There's a gate. It looks like
it's open. I could walk you there.

202
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,090
No,thank you. I made it this far.

203
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,470
Is the path close?

204
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,660
Open the door; you'll step right on it.

205
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:33,800
Thank you.

206
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:37,120
And God bless you.

207
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,070
<i>KEEP OUT</i>

208
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,310
Hello?

209
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,530
Hello?

210
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:26,530
Please... I know you're there.

211
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,440
Jonas Sparrow.

212
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:07,690
I'd know your face anywhere.

You broke in? Okay.

217
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:47,920
So then here's what I want you to do.

218
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,030
Bring the drugs to
this address. You ready?

219
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,850
9000 Temple Street. Downtown.

220
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,000
I'll see you then.

221
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,810
That was my neighbor.

222
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,350
I forgot my pain medication at home.

223
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:03,390
She's gonna run it down here for me.

224
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,760
Please tell me we've made some progress?

225
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:09,750
Sorry. I tried every biometric I know.

226
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,140
Your Caroline doesn't exist.

227
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,640
I'll leave it active and in
the system,at least for now.

228
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,380
If I get any hits off the
face recog, I'll let you know.

229
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:31,750
Esther Louise Carpenter.

230
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,500
From Raymond, New Hampshire.

231
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,300
A blind hitchhiker.

232
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:47,650
And you got all the
way here by yourself?

233
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,030
I was led. By God.

234
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,950
And was that God in the
car that dropped you off?

235
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:58,260
Just one of his instruments.

236
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:02,380
Who told you about this
place, Esther Louise Carpenter?

237
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,490
You did.

238
00:15:05,330 --> 00:15:08,120
I've never seen you before.

239
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,930
But I've seen you.

240
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:13,820
You appeared to me in a vision.

241
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,210
You spoke to me.

242
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:21,930
You said a place had
been prepared for me.

243
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:25,530
You told me to walk out
my door, to not be afraid.

244
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:31,830
You said,"Come to your brothers
and sisters at the Temple."

245
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,330
You said I would be carried here.

246
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,800
As if on the wind.

247
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,160
And then you took my hand,

248
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:50,050
and you held it to your
face so that I would know it.

249
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,810
- Amen.
- Praise be to God.

250
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,430
Hallelujah.

251
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,450
They're taking her inside.

252
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,010
As advertised.

253
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,470
"We shall make a new garden,and
fresh buds will flower there."

254
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,600
It's happening.

255
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,180
If she is what she says she is.

256
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,530
What else could she be?

257
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,650
Brother Seth, I've told you
how we must protect this garden.

258
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,940
There are those who would seek
to destroy it; you know that.

259
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:37,490
Yes.

260
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:40,720
We are commanded to
test all of the signs.

261
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,510
If a serpent should enter, we
must crush it underneath our heel.

262
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,720
You understand that?

263
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:50,560
- Yes,Jonas.
- We must keep the garden pure.

264
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,390
Hello.

265
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,020
Good day.

266
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:09,250
The water is warm.

267
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,770
It feels nice.

268
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,530
Yes,it does.

269
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:20,520
It feels...

270
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,690
nice.

271
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,350
For my money, the Valsalva
mechanism is really the way...

272
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:33,600
w-way to go.

273
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:42,430
I got to go. Something came up.

274
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,540
Doctor?

275
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,580
Topher.

276
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

277
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,410
So,listen. Here's the thing.

278
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,020
I was looking,glancing...

279
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,970
I noticed... Victor.

280
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,350
You noticed Victor.

281
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,510
In the shower,and he's... naked.

282
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,600
Victor's naked in the shower?

283
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,900
Right. Anyway, he seemed
to be having a kind of...

284
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,690
- man reaction.
- A what?

285
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,250
Uh,you know, reaction that a
man person might have in the...

286
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,460
you know,the... naked
part. Shower. Victor.

287
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,850
Victor had an erection?

288
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,810
- I prefer man reaction.
- Why?

289
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:37,260
This is a problem. This can't
happen. It shouldn't happen.

290
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:41,060
When they're in their Doll
state, there's a limp... ness.

291
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,770
Well,I warned about something like this.

292
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,480
When?

293
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,010
His last engagement was
with Miss Lonely Hearts.

294
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:49,350
So? That shouldn't matter.

295
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,550
I mean,okay, it was a romantic
engagement, but he was wiped.

296
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:55,980
This is the eighth time
he's had that exact imprint.

297
00:18:56,020 --> 00:19:00,300
I've cautioned against repeated
imprints in the same Dolls,haven't I?

298
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,600
I don't know. You put it
in one of those reports?

299
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,470
- Of course.
- Okay.

300
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,720
Well,nobody reads those.

301
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,810
How many times has this happened?

302
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,480
I don't know. I wasn't looking for it.

303
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:16,380
Well,now you're gonna have to.

304
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,360
Let's start with the last
three months of shower tapes.

305
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:24,160
We're actually gonna sit down and...

306
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,250
look for the...

307
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:31,510
Man reactions.

308
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,310
This is Sister Emma.

309
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,660
Sister Annabelle.

310
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:40,040
Hello.

311
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,700
Oh,this...

312
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,710
is Iilya.

313
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,750
Hello.

314
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,160
Hello,Iilya.

315
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,680
It's a pleasure to meet you.

316
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,970
And what a handsome face.

317
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,600
Thank you.

318
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,990
Iilya was with us at the
Zion Ranch back in Texas.

319
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,550
You were unhappy there.

320
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:07,130
Things happened there that
should not have happened.

321
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,350
- Jonas led us out of that place.
- He saved us.

322
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:15,260
Esther, Jonas would like to see you.

323
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:34,150
Another female,
approximately 29 years of age.

324
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,640
Let's tag her femme eight.

325
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,720
Could be Andrea Parker
from Florence,Texas.

326
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:43,640
- You have some names?
- Few.

327
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:45,520
Been watching these people a long time.

328
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,610
Any idea who our cry for help came from?

329
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:50,090
Be nice to know who our
ally on the inside is.

330
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:53,360
Yeah,it would be, but we
can't presume any allies.

331
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,750
Damn it!

332
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,670
What happened? We lose our signal?

333
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,200
The signal's still there. I'm
just not getting... What the hell?

334
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,420
I'm going to ask you some questions,Esther,
and I want you to be truthful with me,okay?

335
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,630
Of course.

336
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,900
u work for the government?

337
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:28,940
What?

338
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,970
The federal government--
did they send you here?

339
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,460
No. Of course not.

340
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:36,050
And you're not with law
enforcement of any kind?

341
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,180
No.

342
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,120
I want to believe you,Esther.

343
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:56,160
I want to believe everything you say.

344
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,550
It's a beautiful story.

345
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,400
But the serpent also had a beautiful
story, and the woman was deceived,

346
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:06,340
and the man was corrupted, and they
were forced to leave the garden.

347
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:10,040
I don't understand.

348
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,510
I do not come into this
garden a pure being,Esther.

349
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,720
I come into it the way Adam left.

350
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,180
Broken. Corrupted. Impure.

351
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:29,130
But those whom I shelter--
they are not corrupted.

352
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,310
They have not walked in
the world the way I have.

353
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,100
They have not seen the
things that I have seen.

354
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:39,730
And against this world,
they are defenseless.

355
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,450
So I will protect them.

356
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:47,210
And any who seek to harm
them, to foul this garden...

357
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:53,470
shall fail.

358
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:59,520
Iilya told me that you saved them.

359
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,520
All who are here are blessed.

360
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:26,250
Welcome to the Temple.

361
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,090
Esther.

362
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,930
She who was born for
a time such as this.

363
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,720
Welcome.

364
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,880
He is a great man.

365
00:23:57,190 --> 00:23:59,410
Yes.

366
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,680
You getting this?

367
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,250
Oh,yeah. I'm getting it.

368
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,910
That's an arsenal.

369
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:21,230
- Paul?
- Mellie.

370
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,210
I hope I got here fast enough.
You're not in a lot of pain,are you?

371
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,850
Oh,here's your prescription.

372
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,820
Also some leftover manicotti.

373
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,780
Thank you. I really appreciate this.

374
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:35,430
No big. I've been meaning
to come down here anyway.

375
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,910
You've been meaning to come
down to the Federal Building?

376
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,020
Well... you know.

377
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:44,310
Uh,some guy in the hall
asked me to give you this.

378
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,300
Some guy in the hall?

379
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:49,220
Yeah. I was asking directions,
and he heard me say your name.

380
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,960
I'm right,aren't I? Both were
written by the same person.

381
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,140
Give me a second.

382
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:00,390
And no postmark on either one.

383
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,200
Mellie,describe again the
man who gave this to you.

384
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:07,970
Uh,sure,he was maybe
mid-20s,um,not overly tall.

385
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:10,080
Cute,brownish hair.

386
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,920
Did he have a cart?

387
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,660
A cart?

388
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:16,210
Uh,yes,yes, there was a
cart there. I remember that.

389
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,560
Was there mail on the cart?

390
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:19,560
Uh,yeah,a lot of mail.

391
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,610
Little Stevie from the mail room.

392
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,810
Short,cute,brown hair, too
lazy to walk to your desk.

393
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:27,540
That little bastard.

394
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,810
Still,though,you're right:
the handwriting's a match,

395
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:32,920
so whoever sent you the
photo sent this to you,too.

396
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,300
Okay,hi,Mom. Are we done?

397
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,150
Oh,and the girls of Sigma
Tau. Sisters forever.

398
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,200
Wow,the photograph didn't
really do her justice,did it?

399
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,360
Let's hope those venereal diseases make
you all sterile, you snobby-ass pack of hos.

400
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,880
This is real.

401
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:52,530
I mean,this is who
she was-- just a girl.

402
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,220
Just a girl with a potty mouth.

403
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,250
- Yeah,I probably should have thought about that.
- Someone wanted me to see this.

404
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,550
Can you roll it back?

405
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,860
Ditra and Meg, life without you
will be meaningless and bleak,

406
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,450
- my dormies.
- Okay,well,uh...

407
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,500
I should probably get going.

408
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,440
Okay,thanks again,Mellie.

409
00:26:10,450 --> 00:26:15,320
Let's hope those venereal diseases make
you all sterile, you snobby-ass pack of hos.

410
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,370
Let's roll that back,please. I believe
I spotted a tumescence at 3:21:04.

411
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,880
Tell me what you think.

412
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:29,490
Yeah,it ain't oak, but
it's on its way to wood.

413
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,940
Are we done?

414
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:34,030
Go to Wednesday the 23rd,please.

415
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,430
You know,I could burn these and
you could just take them home.

416
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,620
Go back. There.

417
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,210
- Wait,freeze that.
- I will not.

418
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,470
Of course. If it'd been a snake.

419
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,720
Please pretend I didn't say that.

420
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,050
G
- Go back to 17:57:09.

421
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:02,730
Can you zoom in to his face?

422
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:08,650
Now jump to 24:25:14. Freeze.

423
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,860
Well,I guess that rules
out Miss Lonely Hearts.

424
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:17,020
I
- It's not residual imprinting; it's her.

425
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:19,600
- It's Sierra.
- What?

426
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:25,420
It only happens when she's there, and
it started not long after she arrived.

427
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:28,430
She's the new element that's been
introduced to his environment,

428
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,230
the catalyst to his physical response.

429
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,000
He likes her.

430
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,230
Yeah.

431
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:42,440
When we breach, forward team here.

432
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,550
We need to secure that arsenal.

433
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,050
You're going in now?

434
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,420
Soon as my warrant comes through.
Just waiting on the judge.

435
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,280
Then I need to extract my associate.

436
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:55,890
Sure. Why don't you go knock on the
door, let them know we're coming?

437
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,660
Are you nuts? Your girl stays put.

438
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:01,060
- She's my eyes in there.
- She's served that function.

439
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:03,530
She's provided enough evidence
for you to keep your case alive.

440
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:05,560
Now I would like to do the same for her.

441
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,560
In my judgment this action is premature.

442
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:11,070
Your judgment?

443
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:18,850
Look,I was told not to be too interested
in where you and the girl really came from.

444
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,230
No problem,I'm not.

445
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,550
What I am interested in
is putting Nate White--

446
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,630
or Jonas Sparrow or whatever
he's calling himself this week--

447
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:27,810
back where he belongs
for good this time.

448
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,970
- You know this guy.
- Yeah,I know him.

449
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:32,950
No, you know him.

450
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:39,880
You used to be cop.

451
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,640
Me,too. 12 years,Laughlin PD.

452
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:47,120
Back then he wasn't calling it a church,
and they were mostly underage girls.

453
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,780
We put him away for what
was supposed to be forever.

454
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,430
Forever turned out to
be just shy of two years.

455
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,720
Some judge decided he didn't like
the way we handled the evidence.

456
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,820
So when this judge calls...

457
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,470
I'm not waiting.

458
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:09,890
This is Langton. I need your
okay for a forced extraction.

459
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:13,000
Echo-- she's glitching on
a government job. Damn it.

460
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:15,940
Echo is fine. She has performed
perfectly within parameters.

461
00:29:15,950 --> 00:29:17,180
Then what's the problem?

462
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:18,570
Agent Lilly.

463
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,770
He's about to release the
hounds of hell on that compound.

464
00:29:20,790 --> 00:29:24,030
Echo's imprint will not
have prepared her for this.

465
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,180
- Do nothing.
- What?

466
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:28,610
If you're worried about a glitch...

467
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:32,100
No extraction. Authorization denied.

468
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:40,340
In our book, the story of
Esther is the story of a woman.

469
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,610
Her father died when she was
still in her mother's womb.

470
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,220
Her mother died in childbirth.

471
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:57,450
What was so extraordinary about the
Esther of the Book was her unique vision.

472
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,110
She could see things no one else could.

473
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,950
This was the essence of the Esther
of the Book-- her ability to...

474
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,580
penetrate secrets, to pierce the darkness,
to find the truths others could not.

475
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:13,370
Our Esther,it seems, is no different.

476
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,920
She says I appeared to her in a vision.

477
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:21,640
All right. You all know me.

478
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,920
You know that I make no
special claim to revelation.

479
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,840
I'm just a man, weaker than
most, but my faith is not weak,

480
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,710
and as I see this place and all
of you through Esther's eyes--

481
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,060
her amazing eyes, which
see things no one else can--

482
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:40,740
that faith is only strengthened.

483
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:45,010
Brother Seth,would you
bring our sister forward?

484
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:49,940
Sister.

485
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,050
Esther Carpenter, are you prepared
to forsake the world of men,

486
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,580
to give yourself,your
life, your fidelity,

487
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,610
and your industry to your
brothers and sisters of the Temple?

488
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,950
I am.

489
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,660
Return to the garden.

490
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:20,540
A new beginning.

491
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,530
Nobody move.

492
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,480
The grounds were rigged.
Floods got tripped; we're made.

493
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,760
- Jonas?
- Seth.

494
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,070
I need you with me.

495
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,030
I'm with you,Jonas.

496
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,750
Hold your positions. Do not breach.

497
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,370
Maintain perimeter.

498
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,190
- Brother Seth, guard the window.
- What's going on? I don't understand. What's happening?

499
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,940
Was this you? Did you bring them here?

500
00:32:28,950 --> 00:32:31,650
Who? I don't understand.

501
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,140
Did you do this? Did you
bring the wolves to our door?

502
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,820
- Jonas,no, she's our sister.
- Stop it.

503
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:47,370
The truth this time,Sister.

504
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,520
It's a miracle. I can see.

505
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,760
We're blind.

506
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,400
This is the Bureau of
Alcohol,Tobacco,and Firearms.

507
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:13,460
******

508
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,860
This is worse than Zion Ranch.

509
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,330
Why does he have guns?

510
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,200
We have to trust him.

511
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:36,770
Jonas.

512
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:40,050
You must speak to them...

513
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,560
to your people.

514
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:45,010
They're afraid.

515
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,660
Do you believe it,Seth?
Do you believe in her?

516
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,100
I don't know. I don't
know what to believe.

517
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,700
We took her into the dark;
you put the light in her eyes.

518
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,990
There was nothing: no
physical reaction, no change.

519
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:02,760
How do you fake that?

520
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,440
And yet she sees.

521
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,260
Esther.

522
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,100
Those men outside-- I
know you didn't bring them.

523
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,320
I know you were telling me the truth.

524
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:35,600
They've come to destroy us, to raze
the garden and to salt the Earth.

525
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,800
Esther.

526
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:46,950
Before,I looked into your
eyes and I saw nothing,

527
00:34:47,650 --> 00:34:50,290
and so I believed.

528
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:54,960
And I look into them now...

529
00:34:56,270 --> 00:34:59,140
and I need to know...

530
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,710
was this a miracle?

531
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:10,130
I was blind,but now I see.

532
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:19,380
Then you were brought here for this
purpose: so that I might know what to do.

533
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,660
And now I do.

534
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,570
You've got no way at all
to communicate with her?

535
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,810
No,I really don't.

536
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:32,870
So my inside man is worthless,
is what you're telling me?

537
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,540
She was never your inside man.

538
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:38,120
Oh,so she's just another one of them.

539
00:35:38,130 --> 00:35:39,770
Fine,that's how she'll be treated.

540
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,920
Look,you do have someone on the inside--
whoever sent up that cry for help.

541
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:47,270
We should try to put a name to that, then
at least maybe we can form a strategy.

542
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,700
Weare not going to do anything.

543
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:53,070
You are not a part of this, not anymore.

544
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,640
Oh,great.

545
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,800
It is true.

546
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:04,910
Below us is a cache of weapons Brother Seth and I have
hidden there in the event that this day should ever come.

547
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:07,380
I prayed it would not, but
I always knew that it would.

548
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:10,030
The darkness cannot abide the light.

549
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:13,490
And yet I now believe that
my prayers were answered.

550
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:19,150
Esther was sent to us in advance of these
men-- a demonstration of God's power.

551
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,040
So you will not take up arms.

552
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,250
You will not have to. Come with me.

553
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,210
*****

554
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:36,200
a religious cult known as
the Children of the Temple.

555
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,900
This was the scene today
in Pleasant,Arizona...

556
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:45,390
where agents from the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco,and Firearms surrounded this remote compound.

557
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,300
The sight of the armed agents
caused widespread panic.

558
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:55,650
Cult leader James Sparrow is wanted by
federal authorities on unspecified charges.

559
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,090
I didn't see who wrote the note.
It could have been any one of 'em.

560
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:05,040
There was a bit of a mishegas going on
up at the front of the store at the time.

561
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,690
What kind of mishegas?

562
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,220
Well,Jesse Dillard--
mechanic across the way there.

563
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:13,580
He followed 'em in here and he
tried to,uh, provoke a thing there.

564
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,920
- Why?
- Well...

565
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,820
I mean, they are kind of odd, you know.

566
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:24,470
But,uh,you know, there's been a lot of rumors
about what's going on up there at that compound.

567
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:28,140
Now,I never believed any of
'em until I saw that note.

568
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:32,130
Anyone check the security tape?

569
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,020
Well,nothing was
stolen and nobody asked.

570
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,020
We think he's moved everyone
into this outbuilding here.

571
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,850
No,that's not where
he's got the guns stored.

572
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:48,830
Still,doesn't mean he can't get to them.
There could be tunnels, underground access.

573
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,270
If there are tunnels,why he
didn't use them to move his people?

574
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,940
Why herd them out in broad daylight?

575
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,120
- Will you give us a moment,Carlos?
- Yeah.

576
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:04,160
Okay. You wanted to go in
there and get your girl?

577
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,740
I'm open to letting you do that.

578
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,790
Under a couple of conditions.

579
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,170
How about these conditions?

580
00:38:09,210 --> 00:38:12,470
You stay the hell out of my way and
maybe I don't tell anyone it was you.

581
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,220
You knew he sent his people
into town once a month.

582
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:19,750
You were waiting. You ginned up
tempers. Started rumors in the town.

583
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,100
Created a diversion, and
then you wrote that note.

584
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,990
That's how you got your warrant.

585
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:29,450
Nobody ever asked to
be saved. Not by you.

586
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:37,410
You're witnessing the wonders
of the most high, Brother Seth.

587
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,680
Do not lose faith. Now go. Go.

588
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:53,450
Esther?

589
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,090
Can you,uh,read? Sight-read?

590
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:00,340
It's been a long time. I was nine.

591
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,580
Yes.

592
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:07,530
Read that for us.

593
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,130
"Then...

594
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,130
"Nebuchadnezzar ordered the furnace
"heated seven times hotter than normal..."

595
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:25,570
and commanded the strongest soldiers
in his army "to throw Shadrach,Meshach,

596
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:28,950
"and Abednego into the fiery furnace...

597
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,190
We got movement on the grounds.

598
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,770
They're coming out?

599
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,650
Just one guy.

600
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,560
Is he a black guy?

601
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:41,930
"...the furnacewas so hot "that the
flames of the fire killed the soldiers

602
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,020
"who took them up.

603
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,950
"King Nebuchadnezzar leaped "to his
feet in amazement and asked "his men,

604
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,880
"Weren't there three men that we
tied up "and threw into the fire?

605
00:39:57,090 --> 00:40:00,070
"And the King's men
replied, 'Certainly,O King.'

606
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,450
"And the King said,'Look!

607
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:08,830
"'I see four men walking in the
fire, "'unbound and unharmed,

608
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:13,510
"and the fourth looks
like a son of the gods.'

609
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:18,940
"Nebuchadnezzar "then approached the
opening of the blazing furnace and shouted,

610
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:24,350
"'Shadrach, "'Meshach,and Abednego,
servants of the most high God, "come out!'

611
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,490
"So Shadrach, "Meshach,and
Abednego came out of the fire,

612
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,180
"and the King saw that the fire
"had not harmed their bodies,

613
00:40:33,210 --> 00:40:36,970
"nor was a hair of their heads singed.

614
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:41,450
"Their robes were not scorched and
there was no smell of fire upon them."

615
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,820
We have witnessed more than
one miracle these last days.

616
00:40:50,830 --> 00:40:53,870
Prepare yourselves for the next.

617
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,410
No! No! No! I
- I want to leave.

618
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:59,690
Kris, Kris,wait! Everyone,wait.

619
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,530
Lose your faith, and you will perish.

620
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,990
Those flames can't hurt us.

621
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,700
They'll protect us. Only the
unrighteous will be consumed.

622
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:16,050
It's okay. Come. Sit.

623
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:25,370
Thank you.

624
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,430
Fire seems to be contained
to our target building.

625
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,370
No. This might be a provocation.They
might not even be in there--

626
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,490
trying to draw us out.

627
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,890
All right. Fire gear.
We move in. Same pattern.

628
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:40,050
This is not a rescue
operation-- not yet.

629
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,640
- We're still here to serve a warrant.
- Yes,sir.

630
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,920
That security
consultant-- Langton.

631
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,760
I think he might have
been working with Sparrow.

632
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,060
- The security consultant?
- Yeah,he may be our fire starter.

633
00:41:50,930 --> 00:41:54,190
If he's gone in there, we take him down.

634
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,790
Jonas. Jonas,you have
to let them leave here.

635
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,120
You have to tell them to!

636
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,780
Esther,where is your faith?

637
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,960
This isn't right. You
can't force a miracle.

638
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:37,630
"And he saw "that the flames
did not harm their bodies,

639
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,790
"nor was a hair of their heads singed,
and there was no smell of fire upon them."

640
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:45,800
These people are going to die from
smoke inhalation before the flames...

641
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:52,090
If that's what God wants. You pray.

642
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,770
Let us pray.

643
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:06,980
- Go!
- Esther!

644
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,200
What is wrong with you?
You people are dying!

645
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:09,920
What have you done?

646
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,730
Start taking these people out of here!

647
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,220
He swore to protect them!
If he won't,we have to.

648
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,660
Seth.

649
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,070
The blind girl is looking you in
the eye. Do you know what that means?

650
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,970
It means God brought me here.

651
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:24,290
He has a message for you.

652
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:29,360
And that message... is
"Move your ass!" Go! Come on!

653
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,060
Iilya,we have to go.

654
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,030
- Where will we go?
- I don't know. But outside is life.

655
00:43:55,040 --> 00:43:57,270
In here... no.

656
00:43:57,870 --> 00:44:01,440
How can you doubt after
God restored your sight?

657
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:06,540
Iilya,I don't think God let me
see again so I could just watch.

658
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:12,720
Our home is gone.

659
00:44:24,710 --> 00:44:26,610
- You got him?
- Yeah. Come on,Iilya.

660
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:28,690
- Okay,go! Go!
- Come on!

661
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:37,280
"And he commanded them to purge
the evil from their midst."

662
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,930
Our trouble ends here.

663
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,360
Sparrow?

664
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:07,960
We think he's still in there.

665
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:09,300
Langton and the girl?

666
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,230
I don't know.

667
00:45:12,530 --> 00:45:15,120
Pull your men back.

668
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,030
I know you. How is that possible?

669
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,220
It's not.

670
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:35,820
I thought you were an angel.

671
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:42,190
Of course we won't stop until we're
sure we've found everyone,but...

672
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:45,990
the grim fact is we don't think
there are any more survivors.

673
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,510
Thank God.

674
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:35,180
You the AIC?

675
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,480
I was.

676
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,790
Special Agent Ballard. FBI.

677
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,010
FBI?

678
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,660
Little late to the party.

679
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:44,190
I see that.

680
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,830
The people you took out
of here-- where are they?

681
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:48,280
Being debriefed and then released.

682
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,690
Where?

683
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,010
Look,another agency has a problem how this
went down, you can take it up with my superiors.

684
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:58,890
- I'm not gonna hand you the knife.
- What?

685
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,980
No. I'm looking for this girl.

686
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,980
She look familiar?

687
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,530
She could be anybody.

688
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,430
Look,unofficially,before you release
these folks, just let me talk to them.

689
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:21,200
I don't do things
unofficially. Get a warrant.

690
00:47:22,790 --> 00:47:27,400
A place of safety, of
untroubled certainty, of purity.

691
00:47:28,670 --> 00:47:31,630
This is the world we must maintain.

692
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:36,230
It is imperative that nothing
disturb the innocence of life here.

693
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:40,150
Once any temptation is
introduced, it will spread...

694
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,800
like a cancer, and all will be infected.

695
00:47:43,810 --> 00:47:48,030
Victor must be scrubbed
and monitored closely.

696
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:54,050
So, tell me,Mr.
Dominic. How was Arizona?

697
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:56,960
I understand it's a dry heat.

698
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,600
You requisitioned a
company jet last night.

699
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,230
Echo was glitching on a government job.

700
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,650
I felt I should be on-site in
case measures were called for.

701
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:05,000
I see.

702
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:07,850
As always,just trying to
protect your interests.

703
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:11,630
- I'm touched.
- If I may.

704
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:14,920
Echo has been exhibiting the same signs
Alpha did before his composite event.

705
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,940
Now,if you're not willing
to send her to the Attic...

706
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:19,680
Don't gamble on what I'd be
willing to do,Mr. Dominic.

707
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,040
Take the stairs.

708
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,070
Hello,Echo. How are you feeling?

709
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:37,400
Did I fall asleep?

710
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,920
For a little while.

711
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:41,960
Shall I go now?

712
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,240
If you like.

713
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:53,360
Echo?

714
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:57,420
How's your vision? Can you see okay?

715
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:18,430
I see perfectly.
