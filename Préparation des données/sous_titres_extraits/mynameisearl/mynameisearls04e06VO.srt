1
00:00:01,251 --> 00:00:03,248
WE'VE GOT SPIRIT

2
00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:07,592
<i>It used to be, the best part about
finishing a meal at the Crab Shack was</i>

3
00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:10,036
<i>that you were finished
with a meal at the Crab Shack,</i>

4
00:00:10,156 --> 00:00:11,985
<i>but Darnell was making
a few changes.</i>

5
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:14,163
Can I tempt you fellas
with some desserts?

6
00:00:15,053 --> 00:00:16,895
Strawberry shortcake.
Fancy.

7
00:00:17,055 --> 00:00:18,579
We're trying to class the place up,

8
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:20,787
this was easier
than get rid of that smell.

9
00:00:20,907 --> 00:00:23,526
That strawberry shortcake
sure does look good, huh, Earl?

10
00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:26,613
I don't like strawberries but
I'm gonna take that German chocolate.

11
00:00:27,684 --> 00:00:29,320
I don't like strawberries, too.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,724
I didn't realize
that's what was in it.

13
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:33,612
Chocolate sounds better,

14
00:00:33,732 --> 00:00:36,114
and German is
one of my favorite flavors.

15
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:39,167
You boys finish up your homework.

16
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,894
Don't do too good a job at it,

17
00:00:41,014 --> 00:00:43,107
Mama needs that summer school
for free day care.

18
00:00:43,498 --> 00:00:45,932
I gotta draw something
I think is beautiful for art class,

19
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:47,676
and I can't think of anything.

20
00:00:47,836 --> 00:00:49,844
What about a butterfly,
or a rainbow,

21
00:00:49,964 --> 00:00:52,097
or the small
of Denzel Washington's back?

22
00:00:52,257 --> 00:00:53,890
I drew something beautiful, Mom.

23
00:00:54,182 --> 00:00:55,323
Who is that?

24
00:00:56,038 --> 00:00:56,851
Her!

25
00:01:00,436 --> 00:01:03,309
Please tell me somebody slipped you
a shot of vodka.

26
00:01:03,656 --> 00:01:05,819
She's mine.
Oh, she's fine.

27
00:01:08,298 --> 00:01:10,473
That's mine! That's mine right there.
Come on!

28
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:13,410
Check it out...
A dude cheerleader!

29
00:01:13,895 --> 00:01:16,185
They should put a skirt on him
like the rest of the girls,

30
00:01:16,305 --> 00:01:17,567
and stuff his bra,

31
00:01:17,687 --> 00:01:19,457
and put lipstick on him.

32
00:01:19,902 --> 00:01:23,443
<i>It wasn't the first mob I had ever seen
turn on a male cheerleader, </i>

33
00:01:23,563 --> 00:01:26,040
<i>and it reminded me
of something on my list.</i>

34
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:31,061
Where you going?
Didn't you hear?

35
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:32,846
I'm the new backpack inspector.

36
00:01:33,006 --> 00:01:34,332
George Orwell,

37
00:01:34,452 --> 00:01:36,990
you sure were right about 1984.

38
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,340
What's this?

39
00:01:39,129 --> 00:01:40,243
Oh, my God.

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,799
Kenny wants to be a cheerleader!

41
00:01:42,919 --> 00:01:45,380
No, I don't!
I was gonna audition for the football...

42
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:48,945
Sock mouth.
Nice, Randy.

43
00:01:49,105 --> 00:01:50,616
But you already crossed Kenny off.

44
00:01:50,736 --> 00:01:52,407
Remember? You made him gay.

45
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:55,126
I crossed "I always picked
on Kenny James" off my list,

46
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:58,580
but "kept Kenny from his dream
of cheerleading" is an different item.

47
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,352
Then "made Randy drink
toilet water when he was eight"

48
00:02:01,472 --> 00:02:03,464
and "made Randy drink
toilet water when he was ten"

49
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:05,170
better be two separate list items.

50
00:02:08,664 --> 00:02:09,695
<i>Dios mio!</i>

51
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,092
What's wrong with you?

52
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:13,379
Keep talking,
I'm gonna cut off that hair!

53
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,589
That beautiful, beautiful hair.

54
00:02:16,318 --> 00:02:18,004
<i>At Kimmi Himler Cheer Academy,</i>

55
00:02:18,124 --> 00:02:21,320
<i>you, too, will be able to tuck,
toe touch, tumble, fly and basket toss</i>

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,649
<i>with the best of them.</i>

57
00:02:22,769 --> 00:02:25,315
<i>Each camp session includes
an end-of-session cheer-off.</i>

58
00:02:25,435 --> 00:02:28,083
<i>Come for the cheer,
stay for the friendships.</i>

59
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:30,936
<i>Friendships not guaranteed by camp.
We've got spirit,</i>

60
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:32,290
<i>yes, we do!</i>

61
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,871
<i>We've got spirit,
how 'bout you?</i>

62
00:02:34,991 --> 00:02:37,035
<i>How 'bout you? You?</i>

63
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:40,040
So I checked with the camp

64
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,537
they said they're okay with a grown man
staying in dorms with teen girls.

65
00:02:43,657 --> 00:02:45,960
You just have to sign
a "no statutory rape" waiver.

66
00:02:46,501 --> 00:02:49,855
I told them you were gay, but they said
they're not falling for that again.

67
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,146
Oh, well, that's so nice of you,

68
00:02:52,266 --> 00:02:55,345
but that cheerleading flier wasn't mine.
I've been trying to tell you that was...

69
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:58,918
<i>There was a reason Randy kept
sticking socks in Kenny's mouth.</i>

70
00:02:59,038 --> 00:03:01,142
<i>Kenny didn't want to be a cheerleader.
Randy did.</i>

71
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:04,748
<i>Turns out,
I only knew half the story.</i>

72
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:06,564
Say anything and I'll kill you.

73
00:03:06,896 --> 00:03:09,590
For a gay guy,
you sure do have a good memory.

74
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,481
Randy, I didn't know
you wanted to be a cheerleader.

75
00:03:12,601 --> 00:03:14,531
Come back
so we can talk about this!

76
00:03:14,981 --> 00:03:17,575
That's what girly guys like to do right?
Talk about stuff?

77
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:25,963
I'm in here.

78
00:03:26,801 --> 00:03:27,811
So am I.

79
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:31,140
<i>Randy wanting to be a dude cheerleader
seemed kind of crazy,</i>

80
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,507
<i>but looking back,</i>

81
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:34,517
<i>he'd given me plenty of clues.</i>

82
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:36,594
Cockroach.

83
00:03:41,172 --> 00:03:42,945
I'll have the number two special.

84
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:45,337
What would you like
to order, Randy?

85
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:46,922
Number one!

86
00:03:51,019 --> 00:03:52,296
That's the last beer.

87
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:54,041
I'll go get another case.

88
00:04:02,864 --> 00:04:03,777
Come on.

89
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:06,607
How long do you think you're gonna stay?
These bubbles are going fast,

90
00:04:06,727 --> 00:04:08,626
Kenny doesn't like
anyone else to see Chester.

91
00:04:08,871 --> 00:04:10,753
Stuart!
Put a washcloth over Chester!

92
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,422
Randy, you're on my list now,

93
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:15,633
I can't cross you off
until I send you to cheerleading camp.

94
00:04:15,793 --> 00:04:17,591
So you can make fun of me?

95
00:04:18,218 --> 00:04:20,930
- Tell him you want to go, too.
- No! I'm a man.

96
00:04:21,206 --> 00:04:24,053
It's the only way Randy will do it.
He follows whatever you do.

97
00:04:24,173 --> 00:04:26,853
How many years were you Batman
and Big Batman for Halloween?

98
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,307
<i>Kenny was right.</i>

99
00:04:28,427 --> 00:04:30,295
<i>Randy does do everything I do.</i>

100
00:04:30,526 --> 00:04:32,432
<i>And if I was gonna
cross him off my list,</i>

101
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:35,020
<i>we were going to have to be
cheerleader and big cheerleader.</i>

102
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,839
I made fun of dude cheerleaders
'cause...

103
00:04:38,775 --> 00:04:42,207
I kinda wanted to be one, too.
I just didn't think I could make it.

104
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,571
You're just saying that.

105
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,575
I love cheering.

106
00:04:46,878 --> 00:04:48,955
My whole life
I've dreamed of owning a pom.

107
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,169
- Pom-poms.
- Yeah, two poms.

108
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:54,765
In fact, I've been sneaking off
to cheer for years,

109
00:04:55,281 --> 00:04:56,964
but mostly in the shower,

110
00:04:57,084 --> 00:05:00,633
so I've never tried anything advanced
'cause of how slippery it is in there.

111
00:05:01,839 --> 00:05:03,868
That's why I wear my shoes
when I shower.

112
00:05:04,864 --> 00:05:07,256
Do you still want
to be a cheerleader?

113
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,542
Yep. That's...

114
00:05:10,662 --> 00:05:12,857
why I'm gonna go to this camp
with or without you.

115
00:05:15,197 --> 00:05:18,570
I don't know much about this camp,
but it sounds spec-tac-ular!

116
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:22,035
Kenny taught me
to say it that way.

117
00:05:29,182 --> 00:05:30,212
Ready?

118
00:05:36,134 --> 00:05:39,687
<i>When we were kids, I destroyed
Randy's dream of becoming cheerleader, </i>

119
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:42,294
<i>which probably kept Dad
from kicking him out of the house,</i>

120
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:44,763
<i>but I still needed
to make it up to him.</i>

121
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:47,202
<i>And while we were going
after Randy's dreams,</i>

122
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:50,695
<i>Joy was trying to replace Catalina
in her son's dreams.</i>

123
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:55,948
Hey, sweetheart.

124
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,577
Yes, baby?

125
00:05:59,063 --> 00:06:00,279
You look old.

126
00:06:01,743 --> 00:06:02,953
You look old!

127
00:06:03,276 --> 00:06:05,546
<i>Camp was already a nightmare for me,</i>

128
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,761
<i>but for Randy,
it was a dream come true.</i>

129
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,163
My name is Skyler.

130
00:06:09,582 --> 00:06:12,125
If you go high,
then I'll go higher.

131
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:15,052
My name is Randy,

132
00:06:15,172 --> 00:06:16,632
and I like candy,

133
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,297
and I like corn dogs.

134
00:06:19,308 --> 00:06:21,040
Hello, cheermates!

135
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,345
And welcome
to the Kimmi Himler Cheer Academy!

136
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:30,351
My name is Kimmi Himler.

137
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,527
What's wrong with your face?!

138
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:37,481
Apparently we have
some new campers with us today.

139
00:06:37,601 --> 00:06:39,842
<i>Turns out, Kimmi Himler
was once the captain</i>

140
00:06:39,962 --> 00:06:43,239
<i>of the Nathanville Community College
Fighting Badger cheerleading squad.</i>

141
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,338
<i>We are badgers!</i>

142
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:49,027
B- A-D-G-E-R-S!
We're bad, we're badgers!

143
00:06:49,147 --> 00:06:50,357
<i>And her senior year, </i>

144
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,915
<i>they ditched the guy in the suit
and got a real badger,</i>

145
00:06:53,075 --> 00:06:55,209
<i>which they didn't really
think through.</i>

146
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:59,505
He's gone!
The badger's gone!

147
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,138
Okay, everything's going to be okay.

148
00:07:03,482 --> 00:07:05,928
As long as none of them girls
are on their period.

149
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:19,650
The point is,
I never stopped cheering.

150
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:23,109
Even after the attack when they had
to stick an eight-inch rabies needle

151
00:07:23,229 --> 00:07:25,865
directly into my stomach
once a week for six months.

152
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:28,493
Who else has that kind of spirit?

153
00:07:28,944 --> 00:07:30,077
Mary Lou Retton!

154
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,749
Anyway, everyone find
your hometown

155
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,500
and you'll find
your cheer squad, okay!

156
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,683
What a team.

157
00:07:53,054 --> 00:07:54,942
Great,
just what this team was missing...

158
00:07:55,062 --> 00:07:56,236
two old dudes.

159
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,814
<i>Okay, teams!</i>

160
00:07:57,975 --> 00:07:58,873
<i>Ready,</i>

161
00:07:58,993 --> 00:07:59,862
<i>set,</i>

162
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:00,900
<i>go!</i>

163
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:05,346
What's going on?

164
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:07,115
We're supposed
to be forming a pyramid.

165
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:08,699
Come on, Earl. Get on.

166
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,498
Don't even bother.
Last place gets last dorm pick.

167
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:18,416
As usual, looks like last place
is going to go to

168
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:19,418
<i>Camden!</i>

169
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:22,535
Perfect as usual, Nathanville.

170
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:23,731
Thanks, Mom.

171
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:28,268
Maybe they'll give us
a nice dorm because of your...

172
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:29,428
situation.

173
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:32,849
No, we got the crappy ones last year
and I was pregnant then, too.

174
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,268
<i>Cheer camp was going
to be harder than I thought.</i>

175
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,771
<i>And so was changing Dodge's mind.</i>

176
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,949
Blonde hair and blue eyes is rare,

177
00:08:41,069 --> 00:08:43,536
so it's considered
a treasure of the human race.

178
00:08:43,656 --> 00:08:45,213
It's what World War II was about.

179
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:47,539
Why do you think
the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor?

180
00:08:47,952 --> 00:08:48,739
Jealous.

181
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:55,624
Oh, come on.

182
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:58,305
You just like her 'cause
she's the same color as pancakes.

183
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,620
<i>Even though we would be sleeping
in the third-floor janitor's closet,</i>

184
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,071
<i> they did let us help our teammates
get moved into their rooms.</i>

185
00:09:08,675 --> 00:09:09,802
It's not that bad.

186
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:12,390
If it makes you feel better,

187
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,515
I don't think
that urine smell is from humans.

188
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:17,160
These are the bunks
that Camden gets every year

189
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,722
because we always come last
in everything.

190
00:09:20,261 --> 00:09:22,315
Randy, you know
if we're going to lose anyway,

191
00:09:22,475 --> 00:09:25,943
maybe we should just pack up our tiny,
tight, itchy cheer pants and go.

192
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:27,403
We can't quit.

193
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:29,155
We've got more competitions.

194
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:32,242
And at the end of the week,
we cheer in front of a real crowd.

195
00:09:32,362 --> 00:09:34,730
They'll yell back
any letter you ask them to,

196
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,995
even the hard letters.

197
00:09:36,155 --> 00:09:38,748
What's the point of being in front
of a crowd when we're going to suck?

198
00:09:39,377 --> 00:09:42,335
Speak for yourself, robo-face.
I don't suck.

199
00:09:43,062 --> 00:09:45,036
Cool it, Juno.
You suck worser than she do.

200
00:09:45,156 --> 00:09:48,090
Every time you do a split, I'm afraid
your little mistake's going to pop out.

201
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,930
This pregnancy was not a mistake.

202
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,039
At the time, Coach Barnes and I
were in a committed relationship.

203
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,846
That's not what I heard.

204
00:09:55,007 --> 00:09:56,599
Eat it, chicken fat-ass!

205
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:57,801
Stop it!

206
00:09:57,921 --> 00:09:59,933
Stop calling each other names!

207
00:10:00,053 --> 00:10:02,904
Come on, Preggers, Headgear,
Chunk, Black Girl!

208
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:05,514
You know why Badger Face
treats us so bad?

209
00:10:05,634 --> 00:10:08,653
Because people expect Camden folks
to act this way...

210
00:10:08,813 --> 00:10:09,946
to turn on each other.

211
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:14,325
Me and Earl have been dreaming about
being cheerleaders our whole lives,

212
00:10:14,485 --> 00:10:16,160
but we never did
anything about it

213
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,187
because we let what other
people thought control us.

214
00:10:19,307 --> 00:10:20,403
Right, Earl?

215
00:10:20,897 --> 00:10:23,736
Yep. And now I'm going
to be a cheerleader,

216
00:10:23,922 --> 00:10:27,380
no matter how stupid and...
girly and embarrassing that is.

217
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:29,749
Who cares what
other people think?

218
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:31,951
I'm here to do
whatever it takes

219
00:10:32,071 --> 00:10:34,489
to be the most
best cheerleader I can be.

220
00:10:34,609 --> 00:10:35,617
Me, too!

221
00:10:36,193 --> 00:10:38,667
Maybe, this year,
the football team will finally invite me

222
00:10:38,787 --> 00:10:40,518
to a party
that's actually happening.

223
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,432
That's the spirit, Headgear.

224
00:10:42,552 --> 00:10:44,764
Look at all the good things
about our squad.

225
00:10:45,629 --> 00:10:48,179
Like, Preggers is actually
two cheerleaders in one,

226
00:10:48,299 --> 00:10:50,401
and I can lift
people really high.

227
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:52,298
<i>I was impressed with Randy.</i>

228
00:10:52,418 --> 00:10:54,115
<i>He wasn't just cheering,
he was leading.</i>

229
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,211
<i>After Randy's speech,
a funny thing happened.</i>

230
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:10,580
<i>The girls all went to bed
that night as "I"s,</i>

231
00:11:12,206 --> 00:11:13,776
<i>and woke up as a team.</i>

232
00:11:15,691 --> 00:11:17,910
<i>After a few hours,
we weren't just a team,</i>

233
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:19,336
<i>we were a squad.</i>

234
00:11:19,456 --> 00:11:22,431
<i>Which, later, someone told me
meant the same thing as team.</i>

235
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,335
<i>And our skit could only be
described as raggedy-awesome.</i>

236
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:31,986
Our team is boom, dynamite.

237
00:11:32,146 --> 00:11:35,573
Tick, tick, tick,
boom, dynamite.

238
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:40,052
Our team is boom, dynamite.

239
00:11:41,348 --> 00:11:44,049
<i>By the end of the day,
we had put the other squads on notice.</i>

240
00:11:44,169 --> 00:11:45,537
<i>Camden was here to cheer.</i>

241
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:48,587
That big guy has the spirit
of ten cheerleaders.

242
00:11:48,933 --> 00:11:50,808
Mommy will take care of it.

243
00:11:57,118 --> 00:11:58,721
Sorry, I have bad news.

244
00:11:59,239 --> 00:12:02,057
I went through the rule book,
adult men can't participate in the camp.

245
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:04,352
So P-A-C-K up your crap and go!

246
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:11,776
I guess I won't get to cheer
in front of a real crowd after all.

247
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:14,653
But Kimmi owns the camp.
She can change the rules.

248
00:12:14,913 --> 00:12:16,455
It doesn't matter, Earl.

249
00:12:16,575 --> 00:12:18,944
The president owns the country,
but he doesn't make the rules.

250
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:20,493
<i>Pilgrims</i> make the rules!

251
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:25,331
I'd argue, but History is
the only subject he's better than me at.

252
00:12:31,456 --> 00:12:33,825
<i>I didn't know exactly how I was
going to change Kimmi's mind</i>

253
00:12:33,945 --> 00:12:35,780
<i>about kicking me and Randy out,</i>

254
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,730
<i>but I knew
I had to do something.</i>

255
00:12:37,978 --> 00:12:39,929
Nothing is going
to change my mind.

256
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:41,299
Now, excuse me,

257
00:12:41,419 --> 00:12:43,765
Meg Ryan's about to find out
who's been sending her mail.

258
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,184
It's Tom Hanks.

259
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,312
<i>Over the years, I've come to know</i>
<i>the signs of a lonely woman.</i>

260
00:12:48,472 --> 00:12:49,688
<i>No wedding ring,</i>

261
00:12:49,848 --> 00:12:50,983
<i>sappy movie,</i>

262
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,401
<i>half gallon of ice cream,</i>
<i>one spoon,</i>

263
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,759
<i>and a face horribly disfigured
by a runaway badger.</i>

264
00:12:56,982 --> 00:12:59,857
<i>I had to do whatever it took
to give Randy his chance to cheer.</i>

265
00:12:59,977 --> 00:13:01,169
Listen, Kimmi.

266
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:05,265
I'm not really here
for my brother.

267
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,039
I'm here 'cause I'm lonely.

268
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:09,566
L

269
00:13:10,043 --> 00:13:11,043
O

270
00:13:11,276 --> 00:13:14,088
N-E-L

271
00:13:14,548 --> 00:13:15,548
L

272
00:13:15,709 --> 00:13:16,709
Y.

273
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,263
Lonely.

274
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:21,308
You've got mail.

275
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:22,685
You want it?

276
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:29,557
<i>And so I did
what had to be done.</i>

277
00:13:29,805 --> 00:13:31,594
<i>Unfortunately,
Kimmi was flexible,</i>

278
00:13:31,714 --> 00:13:33,508
<i>so no matter
what position we were in,</i>

279
00:13:33,628 --> 00:13:35,818
<i>we were always face-to-face.</i>

280
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,450
Is your eye going to drip
every time you blink?

281
00:13:45,298 --> 00:13:46,315
Guess so.

282
00:13:48,601 --> 00:13:49,777
We're back in.

283
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,369
I need a hug.

284
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:53,129
<i>I had resorted</i>
<i>to desperate measures,</i>

285
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>and I wasn't the only one.</i>

286
00:13:56,203 --> 00:13:57,716
Baby, what are you doing?

287
00:13:57,948 --> 00:14:00,752
Just spraying on some glitter before
I go read Dodge his bedtime story.

288
00:14:00,872 --> 00:14:02,178
Can you hand me my fishnets?

289
00:14:02,517 --> 00:14:05,222
Good God!
This Catalina thing is making you crazy.

290
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:06,854
What is so crazy about a mama

291
00:14:06,974 --> 00:14:08,559
wanting her son
to think she's sexy?

292
00:14:08,719 --> 00:14:11,667
Everything! Boys aren't supposed
to think their mothers are sexy.

293
00:14:11,787 --> 00:14:13,625
Maybe a couple weird
dreams during puberty

294
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:15,542
you don't tell anyone about,
but that's it.

295
00:14:15,662 --> 00:14:18,402
I'm not just going to sit back and
lose my son to some skeevy señorita.

296
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:20,253
He's not going
to run off with Catalina.

297
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:23,032
Even if she was 8, I doubt
she'd want you as a mother-in-law.

298
00:14:23,757 --> 00:14:25,573
Catalina's just
the flavor of the week.

299
00:14:25,693 --> 00:14:27,550
It'll be some other girl,
and some other girl,

300
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,636
and, before you know it, he's 16
and has a family of his own, and then...

301
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,937
Then he won't need me at all.

302
00:14:38,884 --> 00:14:41,313
Baby, it doesn't matter
how many girls he has.

303
00:14:41,433 --> 00:14:43,068
He only has one mama.

304
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:46,421
- He'll always need you.
- You don't know that.

305
00:14:52,118 --> 00:14:54,480
<i>Darnell fancied himself
a good parent,</i>

306
00:14:55,081 --> 00:14:58,192
<i>and sometimes, when you want to help
someone you love who's hurting,</i>

307
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:00,486
<i>you have to hurt someone else
you love to make it right.</i>

308
00:15:09,502 --> 00:15:10,769
Mommy! Mommy!

309
00:15:10,889 --> 00:15:14,161
The fan fell on me for no reason,
and it was on!

310
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:16,093
Oh, it's okay, sweetie.

311
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:17,585
I'm here.

312
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,127
I'm always going to be here.

313
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:25,794
<i>It was the final performance,</i>

314
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:28,147
<i>and, after staying up
for two nights practicing,</i>

315
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:30,039
<i>the Camden squad
was ready to go.</i>

316
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,552
<i>Unfortunately,
my stomach was, too.</i>

317
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,436
You okay, Earl?

318
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:37,356
I'm feeling a little nauseous.

319
00:15:37,668 --> 00:15:39,675
If you have to hurl,
you should go outside.

320
00:15:39,795 --> 00:15:42,387
We'll lose points if they think
you're doing it to lose weight.

321
00:15:42,507 --> 00:15:44,238
<i>Over the week,
I had gotten used to doing</i>

322
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:46,849
<i>cheerleading around a bunch
of other cheerleaders, but,</i>

323
00:15:46,969 --> 00:15:49,428
<i>when I thought about getting up
in front of a real audience,</i>

324
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,246
<i>my stomach was the one
doing back flips.</i>

325
00:15:52,491 --> 00:15:53,747
What's up, loser?

326
00:15:57,918 --> 00:15:59,128
Randy sent us a postcard

327
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:01,380
saying ya'll were having
a lot of fun at cheer camp.

328
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,377
I do not say this enough.

329
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:06,218
You are a douche bag.

330
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:07,845
Sorry about the camera.

331
00:16:08,082 --> 00:16:09,928
But with all the things
Joy's let me record,

332
00:16:10,048 --> 00:16:11,682
I'd have been rude
to deny her this.

333
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:13,225
Anybody else knows about this?

334
00:16:20,142 --> 00:16:21,317
Oh, my God!

335
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,693
- I can't do this.
- What?

336
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:30,075
Joy brought a ton of people
from the Crab Shack.

337
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:31,818
They got camcorders!

338
00:16:31,938 --> 00:16:33,954
We're going to look stupid
and ten pounds heavier.

339
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:35,956
So what?
This is our dream, Earl.

340
00:16:36,116 --> 00:16:37,441
Not mine. Just yours.

341
00:16:37,561 --> 00:16:39,812
I just lied so I could
cross you off my list.

342
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,579
- That was a horrible thing to do.
- You know what's a horrible thing?

343
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:44,379
Trying to satisfy
a double-jointed woman

344
00:16:44,499 --> 00:16:46,130
while getting squirted
with eye milk.

345
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,371
I did that for you,
but that's it, I'm done.

346
00:16:48,491 --> 00:16:49,762
If you're done, I'm done.

347
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:52,370
No, Randy.
That's how all this started.

348
00:16:53,607 --> 00:16:55,434
Look, all you do is follow me.

349
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:58,270
You can't just do what
I do your whole life.

350
00:16:59,151 --> 00:17:02,191
If this is your dream,
then you do it on your own.

351
00:17:04,699 --> 00:17:06,820
You're right.
I get what you're saying.

352
00:17:07,647 --> 00:17:10,074
I'll do it,
but only if you do it with me.

353
00:17:10,392 --> 00:17:12,993
Oh, damn it, Randy!
This is what I'm talking about.

354
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:15,871
We ain't go on * without you.

355
00:17:16,926 --> 00:17:19,500
We got spirit, yes we do.

356
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:22,002
We got spirit, how about you?

357
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:26,866
<i>The Kimmi Himler Cheer Academy
presents Team Camden!</i>

358
00:17:29,886 --> 00:17:31,553
I do got spirit. Yes, I do!

359
00:17:46,353 --> 00:17:48,779
Thank you, Lord, for the gift
we are about to receive.

360
00:17:50,579 --> 00:17:51,627
Let's go!

361
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:56,245
Are you pressing play?
Press play!

362
00:17:56,405 --> 00:17:57,996
Randy Hickey for
Homecoming Queen!

363
00:17:58,156 --> 00:17:59,873
Shake your pom-poms,
cutie boy!

364
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:02,376
You wouldn't be smiling if you knew
how stupid you looked!

365
00:18:02,536 --> 00:18:03,667
We put this on YouTube

366
00:18:03,787 --> 00:18:06,025
as soon as one of us figures
out how to use a computer!

367
00:18:07,499 --> 00:18:09,007
Your vagina's showing!

368
00:18:09,474 --> 00:18:11,009
<i>My whole life,
Randy's followed me.</i>

369
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,137
<i>He's always been by my side.</i>

370
00:18:13,297 --> 00:18:15,431
<i>You could say
he's been my cheerleader.</i>

371
00:18:15,591 --> 00:18:18,043
<i>And, well, I figured for once
I should be his.</i>

372
00:18:24,082 --> 00:18:25,865
Bang, bang, choo-choo train.

373
00:18:25,985 --> 00:18:27,651
Come on, Camden,
do your thing.

374
00:18:27,811 --> 00:18:29,462
- We can't.
- Why not?

375
00:18:29,582 --> 00:18:31,714
My back is aching,
my skirt's too tight,

376
00:18:31,834 --> 00:18:33,592
my booty's fat
from left to right.

377
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,362
That don't sound
like Camden spirit.

378
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:37,244
I know you got it,
come on, let's hear it.

379
00:18:37,404 --> 00:18:39,079
Bang, bang, choo-choo train.

380
00:18:39,437 --> 00:18:41,123
Come on, Camden,
do your thing.

381
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:43,667
Get it, get it, get it, get it.

382
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:45,294
Got it, got it, got it, got it.

383
00:18:45,454 --> 00:18:47,171
C-A-M.

384
00:18:47,331 --> 00:18:50,188
C-A-M-D-E-N.
Camden!

385
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:58,722
<i>We weren't the best squad
that camp had ever seen,</i>

386
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:01,826
<i>but we were the best squad
Camden had ever seen.</i>

387
00:19:02,387 --> 00:19:04,378
<i>And that was
all because of Randy.</i>

388
00:19:08,434 --> 00:19:10,152
Nice job, cowboy.

389
00:19:10,577 --> 00:19:13,059
The veterinarian who drains
my eye is in Camden.

390
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:14,749
I'm there every Friday.

391
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:16,700
I'm going to look you up.

392
00:19:24,411 --> 00:19:26,343
<i>Later that day, I realized
there were probably</i>

393
00:19:26,463 --> 00:19:28,640
<i> a lot of other things
Randy would enjoy doing</i>

394
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,462
<i>but didn't try because of me.</i>

395
00:19:30,582 --> 00:19:31,954
<i>Like strawberry shortcake.</i>

396
00:19:32,074 --> 00:19:34,808
<i>But, fortunately, I wasn't
the only one realizing that.</i>

397
00:19:34,928 --> 00:19:36,702
Here's your strawberry shortcake.

398
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:38,382
I put the tartar sauce
on the side,

399
00:19:38,502 --> 00:19:40,245
I feared you might
regret that decision.

400
00:19:40,365 --> 00:19:43,204
<i>And maybe Randy had a thing
or two to teach me.</i>

401
