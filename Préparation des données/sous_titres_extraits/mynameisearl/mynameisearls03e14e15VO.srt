00:00:03,053 --> 00:00:04,122
Hello there.

2
00:00:04,242 --> 00:00:07,723
I'm Jeff Zucker,
president and CEO NBC Universal.

3
00:00:07,843 --> 00:00:11,064
Due to the recent writers' strike,
many fans may have forgotten

4
00:00:11,184 --> 00:00:13,439
what's going on
with their favorite show.

5
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:17,873
So, we put together a little recap
to get everybody back up to speed.

6
00:00:19,307 --> 00:00:21,384
It's right here on NBC.com,

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,568
where you can watch
all of your favorite shows.

8
00:00:23,886 --> 00:00:25,946
Preferably within the first 17 days.

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,883
Let's take a look.

10
00:00:28,632 --> 00:00:31,242
This is just
a little commercial from eSurance.

11
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:33,472
I dated a girl with pink hair once.

12
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:35,118
Crazy!

13
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:37,374
<i>Okay. Here we go.</i>

14
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:39,250
<i>So, Earl got out of prison.</i>

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,929
<i>And he tried to get back to his list
and do good things,</i>

16
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:45,090
<i>but Karma wasn't letting
any good things happen to Earl.</i>

17
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,426
<i>So, Earl gave up on his list,
and gave up on Karma...</i>

18
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:50,970
Remember that?

19
00:00:51,295 --> 00:00:54,527
<i>Earl became such a jerk, his friends
put together a Karma intervention.</i>

20
00:00:54,647 --> 00:00:55,511
What?

21
00:00:55,677 --> 00:00:56,805
<i>Intervention.</i>

22
00:00:56,925 --> 00:00:58,402
Also a great show.

23
00:00:58,522 --> 00:01:00,814
You can catch it
on our sister network, A&E.

24
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:03,316
<i>So, anyhow,
Earl's intervention didn't work.</i>

25
00:01:03,476 --> 00:01:06,152
<i>Earl gets hit by a car,
just like he did in the pilot episode.</i>

26
00:01:06,639 --> 00:01:08,863
Writers refer to that as a "callback".

27
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:11,991
I call it, "getting paid twice
for writing the same thing".

28
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:13,660
<i>But look who was driving the car.</i>

29
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:15,704
<i>Alyssa Milano!</i>

30
00:01:15,995 --> 00:01:17,416
Is nice.

31
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:19,179
She plays Billie,

32
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:22,293
<i>a girl who Earl took a liking to
earlier in the season.</i>

33
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:28,485
I did not see that coming.

34
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:31,341
I bet you can't wait to find out
what happens next.

35
00:01:31,461 --> 00:01:33,406
Luckily, you don't have to.

36
00:01:33,526 --> 00:01:36,937
Just stay tuned for a brand-new episode
of <i>My Name is Earl</i>.

37
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:38,101
JZ out!

38
00:01:38,386 --> 00:01:40,812
I WON'T DIE
WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS

39
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,288
<i>Karma finally brought me my good thing</i>

40
00:01:43,408 --> 00:01:46,026
<i>but then plowed into her
at 40 miles an hour.</i>

41
00:01:46,146 --> 00:01:48,321
<i>And I wasn't doing so good myself.</i>

42
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,943
<i>But when you've been
through rough times as much as I have,</i>

43
00:01:51,063 --> 00:01:52,777
<i>you learn ways to deal with it.</i>

44
00:01:52,897 --> 00:01:55,342
<i>Like when I was a kid...</i>
You call this dinner?

45
00:01:55,462 --> 00:01:58,015
I bust my hump all day,
then I come home to salad?

46
00:01:58,135 --> 00:02:00,664
Oh, I'm sorry. Well, here.
I'll just pour some scotch on it,

47
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:02,999
then I'm sure
that you'll lick the plate clean.

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,965
<i>I didn't grow up in the perfect home.</i>

49
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:08,882
<i>But when things got bad,
I turned on the TV and pretended I did.</i>

50
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:11,163
<i>Honey, are my pants done yet?</i>

51
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:13,942
<i>My boss wanted me to go
over the Johnson account this morning,</i>

52
00:02:14,062 --> 00:02:16,014
<i>and I can't debrief in my briefs.</i>

53
00:02:17,425 --> 00:02:20,714
<i>Why not? He might take one look
at those cute legs of yours</i>

54
00:02:20,834 --> 00:02:22,534
<i>and give you a raise.</i>

55
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:30,790
<i>I guess that's why
my mind did what it did.</i>

56
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:35,027
<i>It knew my body couldn't get to a TV
to drown out the pain, so it took over</i>

57
00:02:35,147 --> 00:02:37,994
<i>and did what I had trained it to do
when I was a kid.</i>

58
00:02:39,781 --> 00:02:41,122
Honey, I'm home!

59
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:44,347
<i>My mind created
a nice little world for me,</i>

60
00:02:44,467 --> 00:02:47,337
<i>where my list was finished,
dinner was always waiting,</i>

61
00:02:47,497 --> 00:02:49,890
<i>any problem
could be solved in an half hour</i>

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,522
<i>and I was married to Billie.</i>

63
00:02:51,642 --> 00:02:54,344
Hello, Mr. Senior Account Executive.

64
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:55,970
How's the new corner office?

65
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:58,679
Well, it's so big, it has two corners.

66
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:02,268
That's two more corners
than my father said you'd ever get.

67
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,305
Sam, the two-eyed mailman,
delivered more wedding gifts today.

68
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:12,825
- Not another toaster, I hope.
- Nope.

69
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,263
Four toasters!

70
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,360
Let me guess what's for dinner.

71
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,722
- Toast!
- Toast!

72
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:30,290
<i>Back in the real world,</i>

73
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,858
<i>things weren't going so well
for me or Billie.</i>

74
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:36,719
You guys gonna cut off her shirt?

75
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,140
What happened?
What happened?

76
00:03:41,529 --> 00:03:45,384
Ex-Officer Daniels was driving by
and found them in the street.

77
00:03:45,763 --> 00:03:47,846
Yes, that is how it happened.

78
00:03:56,607 --> 00:03:59,297
Please be a dog...

79
00:04:05,545 --> 00:04:06,544
Aw, crap.

80
00:04:09,172 --> 00:04:12,130
Wacky, wacky
if your neck's not breaky.

81
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,673
His neck's not breaky, is it?

82
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,869
Ambulance man!
Get over here before God takes him!

83
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:20,051
Don't take him, Your Majesty.
Take me instead.

84
00:04:20,171 --> 00:04:21,471
Or my weight in squirrels.

85
00:04:21,904 --> 00:04:23,183
Ambulance man!

86
00:04:23,499 --> 00:04:26,144
Easy there, gorgeous.
Let them do their job.

87
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:28,005
There are two people hurt here.

88
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:30,480
The paramedics had to make
a very difficult decision

89
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,443
and clearly, they have chosen
the hot chick with the nice taters.

90
00:04:36,606 --> 00:04:38,901
<i>This wasn't the first time
Randy had seen me on the ground</i>

91
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:40,597
<i>fighting for my life.</i>

92
00:04:46,673 --> 00:04:49,234
It goes so high
you can't even see it anymore.

93
00:04:49,772 --> 00:04:50,793
Do another one.

94
00:04:55,599 --> 00:04:56,341
Mother!

95
00:04:57,949 --> 00:04:58,885
Pull it out!

96
00:05:00,911 --> 00:05:02,444
Randy, pull it out!

97
00:05:02,683 --> 00:05:05,071
<i>Last time Randy had the choice
of helping me out,</i>

98
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:08,394
<i>he froze up with fear,
ran home, and hid under the bed.</i>

99
00:05:10,169 --> 00:05:12,106
<i>He wasn't going to make
that mistake again.</i>

100
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:19,350
Where the hell is he going?

101
00:05:19,688 --> 00:05:20,406
Nuts.

102
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,893
We've got a stolen ambulance
east bound on Sycomore Street.

103
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,397
I would be in pursuit

104
00:05:25,517 --> 00:05:27,963
but our Al Gore wannabe mayor
decided to go green

105
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,375
and replaced
my squad car with a bicycle.

106
00:05:30,992 --> 00:05:31,977
<i>Copy that.</i>

107
00:05:34,382 --> 00:05:36,214
I hit the girl with my car.

108
00:05:36,973 --> 00:05:39,884
I know, buddy.
We're gonna get you through this.

109
00:05:40,795 --> 00:05:41,988
<i>Between me and Randy,</i>

110
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,556
<i>we had stolen a fire truck,
two cop cars and a bulldozer.</i>

111
00:05:45,716 --> 00:05:47,557
<i>But this was our first ambulance.</i>

112
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:50,004
<i>I just wish
I had been awake to enjoy it.</i>

113
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,981
Hold on, Earl.
You're going to be okay.

114
00:05:59,337 --> 00:06:01,864
Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
I should have strapped you in.

115
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:04,545
Just calm down, Randy.

116
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:07,280
You're no good to anyone
if you can't think straight.

117
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,664
Try to relax.
Listen to a little music.

118
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:13,001
<i>If you can hear us,
bring back the ambulance.</i>

119
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,545
<i>If the patient dies,
you'll be held responsible.</i>

120
00:06:15,705 --> 00:06:17,880
How did that DJ know
I stole an ambulance?

121
00:06:19,902 --> 00:06:21,384
Man, the engine is fried.

122
00:06:21,886 --> 00:06:24,643
Joy, I thought you said
you put oil in the Brat.

123
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:27,849
We are all out of oil, but I sprayed
a can and a half of Pam in there.

124
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:29,997
But you know what?

125
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:32,407
One was regular
and one was butter-flavor.

126
00:06:32,527 --> 00:06:33,771
That's probably it.

127
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,016
Yeah, that's probably it.

128
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,372
Maybe I could fix it.

129
00:06:38,492 --> 00:06:40,506
What are you gonna do, feed it hay?

130
00:06:40,626 --> 00:06:42,905
<i>Queso es not un burro.</i>

131
00:06:44,233 --> 00:06:46,367
Get in, get in!
Earl got hit by a car,

132
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,078
Mom and Dad aren't home,
and I don't know where the hospital is!

133
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:56,044
I can't believe
he got hit by a car again.

134
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:58,880
He really should've put "look both ways
before crossing" on his list.

135
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:03,195
I'm not sure if that worked or not, but
Earl has the softest lips I ever felt.

136
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:04,992
And his mustache tickles.

137
00:07:06,974 --> 00:07:09,858
Is he still breathing?
I can't tell if he's breathing.

138
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:12,197
It might be a good idea
if you'd watch the road

139
00:07:12,317 --> 00:07:14,395
being that we're traveling
at high-speeds and whatnot.

140
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:18,220
Everybody relax.
I know how to wake him up.

141
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,497
This is what I used to do when
he'd pass out in the middle of doing it.

142
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:23,723
Never fails.

143
00:07:27,354 --> 00:07:30,453
Oh, crap. This is really bad.
Darnell, you gotta do something.

144
00:07:30,797 --> 00:07:33,818
You have to save him because
his last words to me were angry ones.

145
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:36,554
I can't have another dead man mad at me.
I need a knife.

146
00:07:36,674 --> 00:07:39,003
I have to cut out his eyes
so his soul can't find me.

147
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:42,391
Looks like you cut out your own eyes
before you chose that outfit you wear.

148
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:45,593
Even in a moment like this
I can still knock 'em out of the park.

149
00:07:46,127 --> 00:07:47,428
Earl, can you hear me?

150
00:07:49,327 --> 00:07:52,254
Dummy? You in there?
Anybody home?

151
00:07:53,052 --> 00:07:55,478
Hello, anybody in there?
Anybody home?

152
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,116
That's my ex-wife.

153
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:09,644
Don't let her...

154
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,333
in.

155
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,556
Hey, dummy.
Hey, Mrs. Dummy.

156
00:08:25,876 --> 00:08:27,718
We just came by
to bring you a wedding gift.

157
00:08:28,018 --> 00:08:29,137
It's a toaster.

158
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:32,056
Just what we needed.

159
00:08:32,815 --> 00:08:34,236
It actually our toaster.

160
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:37,008
And you should know,
the right slot runs hotter than the left

161
00:08:37,128 --> 00:08:38,872
so plan your toast accordingly.

162
00:08:38,992 --> 00:08:40,766
We'd have brought it to the wedding,

163
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:44,081
but the only option on our invitation
was "Will not attend."

164
00:08:44,201 --> 00:08:46,988
So don't be surprised when
you find a cat turd in your toaster.

165
00:08:48,316 --> 00:08:50,940
She held the darn cat
over that thing for two hours

166
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:53,119
I thought he was never gonna go.

167
00:08:53,717 --> 00:08:55,371
Well, it was good seeing you.

168
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,151
I'm sure you got to get going.
Got a long drive back me.

169
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:03,171
You'll have to come for breakfast.
We'll all have toasted cat crap.

170
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:06,174
We don't have a long drive home.

171
00:09:06,567 --> 00:09:08,804
We just bought the house next door.

172
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:19,187
- His heartbeat is really erratic.
- Will this help?

173
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:23,316
We used to bring one of these machines
to Club Chubby on Senior Day.

174
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:24,859
It's called a defibrillator.

175
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:27,195
Save the Spanish
for your friends at the car wash.

176
00:09:27,355 --> 00:09:29,739
- Hand 'em here.
- Have you ever done this before?

177
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:32,587
No, but I started a man's heart
with a car battery and a waffle iron.

178
00:09:32,707 --> 00:09:35,448
This should be a walk in the park.
All right, I'm going to need your help.

179
00:09:35,568 --> 00:09:37,371
Joy, when I say clear,
hit the red button.

180
00:09:38,702 --> 00:09:39,419
Clear!

181
00:09:49,863 --> 00:09:50,927
Oh, crap!

182
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:52,637
I fried my husband's brain.

183
00:09:52,972 --> 00:09:53,930
I'm fine.

184
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,016
Actually, it's not a bad buzz.
Help Earl.

185
00:09:57,176 --> 00:09:59,101
Step aside.
It's time for a little Baywatch action.

186
00:10:01,705 --> 00:10:03,731
- Damn it! I think 're losing him!
- Wait!

187
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:06,104
He can't die in doors.
If his spirit has no escape,

188
00:10:06,224 --> 00:10:07,942
it won't matter if we cut out his eyes.

189
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:11,113
His soul will attach to us,
all our children will have hair lips.

190
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:16,494
Earl's soul! The exit is that way!

191
00:10:16,654 --> 00:10:18,537
What the hell, bitch?
Shut the damn...

192
00:10:26,997 --> 00:10:30,437
<i>Back when we were married and Joy road
on top of me while I was passed out,</i>

193
00:10:30,557 --> 00:10:33,177
<i>the only thing that risk
was an unwanted pregnancy.</i>

194
00:10:33,337 --> 00:10:34,971
<i>Today's risk was death.</i>

195
00:10:35,131 --> 00:10:37,265
<i>But luckily, my mind had no idea.</i>

196
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:43,688
Can I talk to you for a second?

197
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:47,692
Problem, honey?

198
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:50,361
Well, I know Randy's a real hoot,

199
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:52,530
but I'm not sure
about him living with us.

200
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:54,143
It's the perfect plan.

201
00:10:54,263 --> 00:10:56,539
We don't want Joy coming over, right?

202
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:58,181
The only thing she hates more

203
00:10:58,301 --> 00:11:00,871
than a restaurant
with a no flip-flap sign is Randy.

204
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,326
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

205
00:11:08,217 --> 00:11:09,130
I did it!

206
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:11,465
I finally got that candy corn
out of my ear.

207
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:15,386
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
Randy's kind of a slob.

208
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:19,901
I got an idea.

209
00:11:20,745 --> 00:11:22,996
Trust me, I know what I'm doing.

210
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:30,318
See? Everything work out perfectly.

211
00:11:30,478 --> 00:11:32,762
I told you, I know what I'm doing.

212
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:36,198
Without all that mess that's usually
around you, you're not so bad,

213
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:38,551
I could hang out with you all day.

214
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:41,845
Well, I guess I don't ow what I'm doing.

215
00:11:42,799 --> 00:11:45,272
This place is so clean,
Darnell and I should move in

216
00:11:45,392 --> 00:11:48,032
and rent out our house
to that one-legged girl that hates you.

217
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:57,982
Oh, snap.

218
00:12:15,643 --> 00:12:17,615
That's a fine cattle of fish.

219
00:12:19,568 --> 00:12:22,669
<i>Fortunately, my out of control
wheelie bed came to a stop.</i>

220
00:12:22,789 --> 00:12:25,331
<i>Unfortunately,
it was now hooked to a semi.</i>

221
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:26,870
<i>Joy didn't get a license plate,</i>

222
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,960
<i>but she did see the truck was from
Waadt Appliance, so they went there.</i>

223
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:33,297
Great to see you.
How's your brother?

224
00:12:33,457 --> 00:12:34,940
He's good. He's good.

225
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,258
Actually, he's passed out,
strapped to a wheelie bed

226
00:12:37,378 --> 00:12:40,429
and attached to the front of one
of your trucks, so he might be dead.

227
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:42,322
You guys and your adventures.

228
00:12:42,442 --> 00:12:44,466
You know who you should call?
My brother's a cop.

229
00:12:44,586 --> 00:12:47,243
He rides a bike now,
but he swears it's not a demotion.

230
00:12:47,363 --> 00:12:48,987
No. No pigs.

231
00:12:49,107 --> 00:12:51,231
Hey, that's my brother
you're talking about.

232
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:53,085
He is a little on the husky side.

233
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,403
I've been trying to get him on Atkins.
Saved my life.

234
00:12:56,433 --> 00:12:58,346
The truck had woman driver.

235
00:12:58,466 --> 00:13:01,189
Tall, scrawny, apparently
doesn't respond to somebody screaming,

236
00:13:01,309 --> 00:13:03,233
"Stop, bitch,
my friend's stuck on your grill."

237
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:04,499
That'd be Sissy.

238
00:13:04,619 --> 00:13:06,872
She was probably on her way home.
She owns her own truck.

239
00:13:07,032 --> 00:13:09,166
Can you draw a map
to Sissy's house on my hand

240
00:13:09,326 --> 00:13:11,168
and a map to the hospital on this one?

241
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,735
But if her house
is close to the hospital,

242
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,756
you could put them on the same hand-map.

243
00:13:17,949 --> 00:13:19,788
<i>While my friends hunted for me,</i>

244
00:13:19,908 --> 00:13:22,255
<i>Billie slowly made her way
to the hospital.</i>

245
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:29,098
Where do you think the odds are?
He just got better and walked home.

246
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:31,604
About the same as
if he spontaneously combusted.

247
00:13:31,887 --> 00:13:34,246
Not true. The government
doesn't want you to know it,

248
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,684
but people spontaneously
combust all the time.

249
00:13:36,804 --> 00:13:39,530
That's why you see so many sneakers
hanging from power lines.

250
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:47,288
He left less than 25 minutes ago.

251
00:13:49,373 --> 00:13:52,626
You share a bed with a guy
for long enough, you learn a few things.

252
00:13:52,786 --> 00:13:55,754
He must have fallen. We need to find out
what route she took to get here.

253
00:14:08,052 --> 00:14:10,071
I thought you were the pizza guy.
What do you want?

254
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:12,891
We're looking for my brother, Earl.
We have to get him to a doctor fast.

255
00:14:13,011 --> 00:14:15,184
He was on the bed stuck
to the front of your truck.

256
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:16,914
What are you talking about?

257
00:14:19,313 --> 00:14:22,239
Sam Hill, that'd better not
have dented my grill.

258
00:14:23,335 --> 00:14:27,858
I'm sorry, but this is driving me crazy.
You have an eyelash our cheek.

259
00:14:29,541 --> 00:14:32,708
You have enough working against you
without this hanging of you face.

260
00:14:33,614 --> 00:14:35,336
Look, I haven't seen your brother.

261
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:36,918
But if you do,

262
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:40,093
you tell him to watch
where he's driving that wheelie bed.

263
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,254
He needs to stay in the bike lane.

264
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:47,681
No joke, this is the thickest eyelash
I have ever seen.

265
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:51,070
Dag, I bet you could get
ten wishes from that thing.

266
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:53,222
Go ahead.

267
00:14:55,057 --> 00:14:55,856
Wait!

268
00:15:04,846 --> 00:15:06,365
This isn't an eyelash.

269
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:08,452
This is one of Earl's mustache hairs.

270
00:15:10,337 --> 00:15:13,499
You share a toothbrush with a guy,
you learn what his mustache tastes like.

271
00:15:13,659 --> 00:15:16,228
Something fishy's going on here.

272
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:26,929
So, where were we, lover?

273
00:15:34,283 --> 00:15:35,896
Oh, snap!

274
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:39,838
Oh, hell no.
You are not gonna try to steal that.

275
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:44,822
Get yo boobs off my brother!

276
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:48,164
Please don't take him from me.

277
00:15:48,284 --> 00:15:50,289
God left him to me
on the front of my truck.

278
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:52,246
He usually just leaves me
bugs and birds.

279
00:15:52,571 --> 00:15:54,660
Anyway, you can't take him from me.

280
00:15:54,825 --> 00:15:56,375
We already exchanged vows.

281
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:58,700
Okay, she's crazy.

282
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,007
Lucky for us,
I know how to talk to crazy.

283
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:03,694
Hey, sweetheart.

284
00:16:03,814 --> 00:16:05,655
Look, we are not gonna to take your men.

285
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:08,554
We're just gonna fix him for you,
'cause he's broken.

286
00:16:09,191 --> 00:16:12,266
For starters, we're gonna check
and see if he's still alive.

287
00:16:13,844 --> 00:16:14,935
He's crashing!

288
00:16:15,095 --> 00:16:17,147
See, he's crashing,
and what at means to us is,

289
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,339
we should take him
and clean him up for you

290
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:21,775
and maybe make him,
not almost dead.

291
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:23,283
Well, that could help.

292
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:26,071
He just doesn't seem that into it
when we're kissing.

293
00:16:26,501 --> 00:16:30,034
Well, then we're just gonna make him
more lively and bring him right back.

294
00:16:30,194 --> 00:16:33,871
Think you could give him a little perm?
Like the Mexican soccer players.

295
00:16:34,031 --> 00:16:37,398
And see if the doctors can pump him up
a little down south there, you know...

296
00:16:37,518 --> 00:16:39,168
again, like a Mexican soccer player.

297
00:16:40,386 --> 00:16:43,002
We'll pimp your ride, don't worry.

298
00:16:44,558 --> 00:16:48,159
Can you transport Sissy's new boyfriend
out of here, please?

299
00:16:48,662 --> 00:16:50,511
For the perm, would you like...

300
00:16:50,672 --> 00:16:53,885
more Shirley Temp ringlets
or more of a Weirdl Yankovic?

301
00:16:55,042 --> 00:16:56,505
That lady's crazy.

302
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,564
Earl with curly hair?
Not with those cheekbones.

303
00:16:59,684 --> 00:17:02,358
- Good thing we're not real doing that.
- What?

304
00:17:02,518 --> 00:17:04,740
You're not bringg him back, are you?

305
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,539
You're taking him
for your own dirty needs.

306
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:08,614
Run!

307
00:17:22,538 --> 00:17:24,597
Damn, that was my go-to.

308
00:17:28,382 --> 00:17:29,873
She's got a gun!

309
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:40,097
Ah, crap.

310
00:17:40,217 --> 00:17:41,897
You're a coward, Randy Hickey.

311
00:17:46,339 --> 00:17:48,471
This is a little trick
my twin brother taught me.

312
00:17:48,591 --> 00:17:51,532
He pops dents out of washers and dryers
so they can sell themfull price.

313
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,826
He's a clever little, skinny fella.

314
00:17:53,986 --> 00:17:57,663
Listen, I don't feel right about this.
That dent was made by the girl's head.

315
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:01,271
What dent?
Never happened. You're golden.

316
00:18:07,288 --> 00:18:09,764
So no one else
is chasing this ambulance?

317
00:18:09,884 --> 00:18:12,344
Cop on a bike is all we got today?

318
00:18:22,931 --> 00:18:24,231
Is Earl okay?

319
00:18:24,573 --> 00:18:28,318
He's suffered serious head trauma
and massive internal injuries.

320
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,054
Well, at least they're internal.

321
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:34,158
He also has severely bruised nipples.

322
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,036
We might not be able
to save one of them.

323
00:18:37,196 --> 00:18:41,528
In addition, he has some palet shaped
burns on the sides of his head,

324
00:18:41,648 --> 00:18:43,041
And let's see what else.

325
00:18:43,201 --> 00:18:45,064
His left buttock
is filled with buckshot,

326
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:47,296
his teeth are covered in bugs,

327
00:18:47,456 --> 00:18:49,255
and last but not least, we're not sure,

328
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,426
but we think he might have had
an involuntary orgasm.

329
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:55,480
Oh, my God, that crazy bitch tried
to constipate the marriage.

330
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,431
He's going to be okay, right, doc?

331
00:18:57,844 --> 00:18:59,183
Define "okay."

332
00:18:59,343 --> 00:19:01,185
- Not dead.
- I don't know.

333
00:19:01,345 --> 00:19:03,812
Can't you tell us
anything good about Earl?

334
00:19:03,972 --> 00:19:07,441
He has a fantastic mustache and,
praise be to Ganesh it was unharmed.

335
00:19:09,102 --> 00:19:11,331
Other than that, all we can do is pray.

336
00:19:11,922 --> 00:19:15,574
I bet you wish you had
more than one god now, uh?

337
00:19:23,923 --> 00:19:26,652
<i>So, there I was, fighting for my life.</i>

338
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:29,780
<i>My body had taken just about
all the punishment it could handle,</i>

339
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,183
<i>and it was fading.</i>

340
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,669
<i>But not my mind.</i>

341
00:19:32,789 --> 00:19:34,541
<i>My mind was hanging on.</i>

342
00:19:38,518 --> 00:19:39,807
I don't understand.

343
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:43,644
I took the batteries out of all of them.
Where is that bipping coming from?

344
00:19:43,953 --> 00:19:45,355
I don't hear it!

345
00:19:56,124 --> 00:19:59,196
<i>After a round about trip to the hospital
that got me shocked,</i>

346
00:19:59,316 --> 00:20:02,772
<i>dropped, lost
and possibly molested by a she-trucker,</i>

347
00:20:02,892 --> 00:20:05,291
<i>I was finally
under the semi professional care</i>

348
00:20:05,411 --> 00:20:07,262
<i>of Camden County Hospital.</i>

349
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:11,213
You're gonna wake my brother now,
Mr. Doctor?

350
00:20:11,373 --> 00:20:14,133
Do you remember earlier we talked
about something called a coma?

351
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:17,653
Oh, yeah. The story about the bears
sleeping through the winter.

352
00:20:17,773 --> 00:20:20,305
Right... And we don't try wake them.

353
00:20:21,361 --> 00:20:24,101
Hopefully, your brother'll pull through
and wake up on his own.

354
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:26,832
Yeah, listen here, Dr. Bob-a-ganoush.

355
00:20:26,952 --> 00:20:29,053
You people might be great
at running cheap motels,

356
00:20:29,173 --> 00:20:31,631
but we're gonna require
a second opinion from a real doctor.

357
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,068
You know, a Jewish one.

358
00:20:33,437 --> 00:20:35,487
I'm Indian. We're the new Jews.

359
00:20:35,647 --> 00:20:38,115
- I thought that was Koreans.
- They wish.

360
00:20:38,275 --> 00:20:41,624
<i>A lot was going on around me,
but I was pretty unaware of it.</i>

361
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,588
<i>I was also unaware that Billie
was lying in the very next room.</i>

362
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:49,173
<i>My mind was in an other place.
My safe place.</i>

363
00:20:49,293 --> 00:20:50,465
<i>TV world.</i>

364
00:20:50,585 --> 00:20:53,213
<i>And by now,
my mind had even made up a theme.</i>

365
00:20:56,209 --> 00:20:59,094
<i>He is the perfect businessman</i>

366
00:20:59,254 --> 00:21:02,097
<i>She is the perfect wife</i>

367
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:05,100
<i>Together they live in the perfect house</i>

368
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,437
<i>And they thought
they had the perfect life</i>

369
00:21:09,306 --> 00:21:12,191
<i>But they're never alone
No, they're never alone</i>

370
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:16,589
<i>They never have a moment to themselves</i>

371
00:21:17,689 --> 00:21:19,625
<i>'Cause they're never alone!</i>

372
00:21:25,471 --> 00:21:28,205
It's all my fault.
What are we gonna do now?

373
00:21:28,325 --> 00:21:30,278
When I stopped by
the hospital the other day,

374
00:21:30,398 --> 00:21:31,919
Earl's nurse gave me this.

375
00:21:33,245 --> 00:21:36,007
On the back is a coupon
for a free pancake breakfast...

376
00:21:36,127 --> 00:21:39,092
with purchase of second pancake
breakfast. That's how they get you.

377
00:21:39,252 --> 00:21:41,553
Guess what I picked up
in the parking lot at Club Chubby.

378
00:21:41,673 --> 00:21:42,471
Gonorrhea?

379
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,516
Oh, my God, it's Earl's list!

380
00:21:47,878 --> 00:21:50,479
There are sure a bunch of stuff
he never got to cross off.

381
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:51,799
What do you mean "never?"

382
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,274
He's gonna cross the rest off
as soon as he wakes up.

383
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,620
- Look Randy...
- No.

384
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,290
No "look Randy," and no "never,"

385
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:02,626
and no pamphlets
with the sad pull the plug face on.

386
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:04,943
People come back
from the dead all the time.

387
00:22:05,063 --> 00:22:08,059
Zombies, werewolves, vampires.

388
00:22:08,179 --> 00:22:09,289
Need I go on?

389
00:22:09,595 --> 00:22:11,375
Randy's right. We can't give up.

390
00:22:11,657 --> 00:22:13,085
We have to do something.

391
00:22:13,245 --> 00:22:15,999
Well, there are documented cases
of coma patients lured back

392
00:22:16,119 --> 00:22:18,698
into consciousness
when exposed to certain stimuli.

393
00:22:18,818 --> 00:22:20,123
You know, things they enjoy.

394
00:22:20,243 --> 00:22:23,476
Hey, Earl likes that show
<i>Lancelot Link: Secret Chimp</i>.

395
00:22:23,596 --> 00:22:25,514
You think they'd let a monkey
in the hospital?

396
00:22:25,674 --> 00:22:27,391
Did you have any problems to get in?

397
00:22:27,997 --> 00:22:30,979
No. Not once I figure out
that revolving door.

398
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:35,041
<i>So, my friends set about to draw me out
of my coma using different stimuli.</i>

399
00:22:35,161 --> 00:22:37,025
<i>Things that might
inspire me back to life.</i>

400
00:22:37,342 --> 00:22:38,527
It's bacon, Earl.

401
00:22:38,687 --> 00:22:40,195
You always wake up for bacon.

402
00:22:41,901 --> 00:22:43,031
How about boobs?

403
00:22:43,346 --> 00:22:45,367
You used to wake up
for these often enough.

404
00:22:46,002 --> 00:22:46,952
Sorry, Darnell.

405
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,080
I'm cool. You know I don't consider
above the waist to be cheating.

406
00:22:51,074 --> 00:22:53,923
Squeeze, baby.
You're a vegetable, not a fruit.

407
00:22:54,043 --> 00:22:55,925
<i>When boobs and bacon didn't work,</i>

408
00:22:56,045 --> 00:22:58,797
<i>Darnell tried to open
my eyes to new experiences.</i>

409
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:02,426
A third European city you may want
to wake up and visit is Amsterdam,

410
00:23:02,586 --> 00:23:03,719
or as I like to say,

411
00:23:04,034 --> 00:23:05,282
Amster-Jam.

412
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:08,308
You'll see what I mean
when you get there.

413
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,751
<i>They even helped keep
me up on current events.</i>

414
00:23:12,871 --> 00:23:15,647
And here's a picture
of Amy Winehouse taking out the trash.

415
00:23:15,807 --> 00:23:18,612
And here's a picture
of Zac Efron getting gas.

416
00:23:18,864 --> 00:23:22,345
And here's a picture of Paris Hilton
reading to her friend in coma.

417
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:25,245
They really are just like us.

418
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:26,958
<i>They tried classic rock.</i>

419
00:23:27,078 --> 00:23:29,243
<i>Burn out the day</i>

420
00:23:30,747 --> 00:23:33,290
<i>Burn out the night</i>

421
00:23:34,295 --> 00:23:38,378
<i>I can see no reason to put up a fight</i>

422
00:23:41,915 --> 00:23:46,121
<i>I'm burning, I'm burning
I'm burning for you...</i>

423
00:23:48,514 --> 00:23:51,892
<i>And when nothing else worked,
they went for the grand finale.</i>

424
00:24:03,284 --> 00:24:06,644
<i>The stuff they were doing didn't do
so much to bring me back,</i>

425
00:24:06,764 --> 00:24:09,465
<i>but it had a big impact
on the place I was.</i>

426
00:24:17,282 --> 00:24:18,543
Do I smell bacon?

427
00:24:18,703 --> 00:24:20,819
Well, it wouldn't be morning
in the Hickey household

428
00:24:20,939 --> 00:24:22,714
without fresh-cooked bacon from Paris.

429
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,341
Paris, France?

430
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:26,825
No, silly, Paris Hilton.

431
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,404
That's hot.

432
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:34,518
- Randy, what are you doing?
- I told Paris I'm a cowboy.

433
00:24:34,678 --> 00:24:35,727
That's hot.

434
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:38,967
Well, it's off to work.
Big meeting put the boss today.

435
00:24:39,087 --> 00:24:40,241
Bye, sweetie.

436
00:24:41,207 --> 00:24:42,272
That's hot.

437
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:45,795
<i>Randy wasn't a religious man,</i>

438
00:24:45,915 --> 00:24:47,752
<i>other than believing
in the Great Pumpkin,</i>

439
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,872
<i>but these were desperate times.</i>

440
00:24:49,992 --> 00:24:53,243
Dear Lord, it's me, Randy Hickey.

441
00:24:53,793 --> 00:24:56,593
Please tell me what to do
to save my brother.

442
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:02,883
But Lord...

443
00:25:03,885 --> 00:25:05,939
I'm sorry, I'll let you finish.

444
00:25:09,947 --> 00:25:13,516
Perfect. I know how yo help you.
I'll be right back.

445
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:15,998
Why didn't you tell me this before?

446
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,777
You're right.
I should've asked.

447
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,939
Guys, I know how to save Earl!

448
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,740
God's Little Finger!

449
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,463
Oh, snap! I forgot all
about that creepy little faith healer.

450
00:25:29,583 --> 00:25:32,868
Randy, you believe in faith healers?
You're suspicious of the weatherman.

451
00:25:33,028 --> 00:25:36,955
Faith healers just cure diseases.
They don't pretend to predict the futur.

452
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:39,950
He's right. This kid's the real deal.

453
00:25:41,354 --> 00:25:44,737
The power of God will heal you!
Heal you!

454
00:25:45,055 --> 00:25:46,878
In the name of God,
it will heal you!

455
00:25:46,998 --> 00:25:49,140
<i>Joy and Randy knew
Gerald was real because,</i>

456
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,028
<i>'cause they've seen him
with their very own eyes.</i>

457
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,012
Rising,

458
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:56,222
Rising! Rising!
God's Little Finger says heal!

459
00:25:56,959 --> 00:25:58,189
Oh, my God.

460
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:02,272
I think I can see light.
And now I see sheaves.

461
00:26:02,432 --> 00:26:04,475
I think... I can see.

462
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:05,657
Oh, it's gone.

463
00:26:05,777 --> 00:26:08,292
Oh, wait. It's back again.
Oh, it's gone again.

464
00:26:08,412 --> 00:26:10,729
You're just blinking, brother.
You'll get used to that.

465
00:26:10,849 --> 00:26:12,069
Praise God.

466
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:14,748
Pick me! Pick me!

467
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:17,614
In the name of the Father Son
and the Friendly Ghost, pick me!

468
00:26:17,734 --> 00:26:19,656
<i>Joy wasn't usually the religious type,</i>

469
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,941
<i>except she was in battering.
Found herself in higher need.</i>

470
00:26:23,061 --> 00:26:25,665
You got to heal my giant zit.
My high school reunion is this weekend,

471
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:28,340
and I want my english teacher
to regret picking his wife over me.

472
00:26:32,347 --> 00:26:33,698
What happened to your leg?

473
00:26:33,818 --> 00:26:35,764
I tripped over some conjoined twins.

474
00:26:35,924 --> 00:26:37,898
Wasn't my fault.
I didn't see the back one.

475
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:40,808
Dady, give me
one more person up here on stage.

476
00:26:41,304 --> 00:26:43,438
Pick me! I can barely walk.

477
00:26:43,598 --> 00:26:45,322
Damn it, Earl, this is my turn.

478
00:26:45,442 --> 00:26:48,266
This zit's getting so big,
it's got a little zit on the side of it.

479
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:51,404
You, sir, you with the mustache
and the gimpy leg.

480
00:26:55,579 --> 00:26:58,983
Don't worry, Joy. I'm sure everybody
at your reunion's gonna be talking

481
00:26:59,103 --> 00:27:02,234
about your black and white kids
and your terrible personality,

482
00:27:02,354 --> 00:27:03,708
not your big, disgusting zit.

483
00:27:04,903 --> 00:27:08,330
I'm charging up
with the power of Christ!

484
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,423
I'm charging!

485
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:13,134
- You ready?
- Yeah.

486
00:27:13,294 --> 00:27:14,469
Bring it!

487
00:27:14,629 --> 00:27:17,261
God's Little Finger says heal!

488
00:27:19,264 --> 00:27:20,100
Oh, my God.

489
00:27:20,727 --> 00:27:21,851
My leg doesn't hurt.

490
00:27:22,971 --> 00:27:23,824
Incredible!

491
00:27:23,972 --> 00:27:25,389
I'm healed!

492
00:27:25,723 --> 00:27:27,440
The flick sound a little low.

493
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,198
Rising!

494
00:27:37,277 --> 00:27:39,192
God's Little Finger says heal!

495
00:27:39,312 --> 00:27:40,161
Got it!

496
00:27:43,441 --> 00:27:45,951
The next morning, that zit crusted over
and flicked right off.

497
00:27:46,071 --> 00:27:47,579
A healer healed my grandmother

498
00:27:47,699 --> 00:27:49,963
of Restless Leg Syndrom
right before she died of cancer.

499
00:27:50,726 --> 00:27:52,882
In hindsight, we should
have targeted the cancer.

500
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:56,769
<i>Knowing I needed a miracle,</i>

501
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:59,491
<i>my friends went to track down
that little faith earler.</i>

502
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:02,149
<i>Unfortunaty, he had lost his faith.</i>

503
00:28:02,269 --> 00:28:05,103
- So, could you?
- I'm sorry, I don't heal anymore.

504
00:28:06,971 --> 00:28:10,287
I wear these to make sure
I don't even touch anybody by accident.

505
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,945
I don't get it.
Why wouldn't you want to fix people?

506
00:28:14,105 --> 00:28:15,530
Why don't you ask the harlot?

507
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:20,214
<i>Turns out a couple days after healing us
with the spirit of the Lord,</i>

508
00:28:20,334 --> 00:28:22,453
<i>Gerald saw us filled
with the spirit of the Devil.</i>

509
00:28:22,573 --> 00:28:25,166
<i>I'm in front of Chubby's Groceries
where we have acquired</i>

510
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:28,192
<i>exclusive security-cam footage
of the latest robbery</i>

511
00:28:28,312 --> 00:28:32,339
<i>by the criminals weird dubbing
"Smokey and the Tube Top Bandit."</i>

512
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:33,816
<i>According to victims,</i>

513
00:28:33,936 --> 00:28:39,095
<i>the female perpetrator uses the lure
of a flimsy tube top as a distraction</i>

514
00:28:39,255 --> 00:28:42,724
<i>while her mustachioed accomplice
absconds with their shopping cart.</i>

515
00:28:42,844 --> 00:28:45,611
<i>Here you can see a bystander
attempt to stop the accomplice</i>

516
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:48,236
<i>only to be assaulted by canned good.</i>

517
00:28:49,061 --> 00:28:52,776
<i>After interviewing the victims,
police have released these sketches.</i>

518
00:28:52,936 --> 00:28:55,340
<i>Witnesses noted
the female pertrator's...</i>

519
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,155
<i>glowing, flawless skin.</i>

520
00:28:57,315 --> 00:29:00,244
<i>And her accomplice
cat liked speed and agility.</i>

521
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:06,331
God in Heaven, what have I done?

522
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,446
How am I supposed to know
who to heal and who not to?

523
00:29:10,566 --> 00:29:11,763
I'm not God.

524
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:13,838
Just his little finger.

525
00:29:13,998 --> 00:29:16,299
Yep, you ruined a really good thing.

526
00:29:16,792 --> 00:29:18,385
No more revivals.

527
00:29:18,545 --> 00:29:20,560
No more fancy, two-story house.

528
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:24,140
Now, I'm killing possums just
to keep the lights on in this dumpp.

529
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,184
You charged people for faith-healing?

530
00:29:27,269 --> 00:29:29,345
He may have healing powers from God,

531
00:29:29,465 --> 00:29:31,898
but it's not like
he can multiply loaves and fishes.

532
00:29:32,299 --> 00:29:35,360
His family still needs to eat.
Wouldn't you do the same think?

533
00:29:35,647 --> 00:29:38,251
Unlikely.
I have a turtle who can tap-dance,

534
00:29:38,371 --> 00:29:41,991
given the right song and surface,
and I let people watch him for free.

535
00:29:44,028 --> 00:29:46,279
You don't have to feel bad anymore.

536
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:48,998
It's okay that you healed Earl,
'cause he's not evil.

537
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:52,377
He's turned his life around.
He even made a list,

538
00:29:52,537 --> 00:29:55,668
of all his bad deeds,
and he's making up for 'em.

539
00:29:56,919 --> 00:30:00,176
We could even put you on it,
since he upset you and all.

540
00:30:00,336 --> 00:30:01,010
Here.

541
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:06,099
"Made a healer boy
scared of his own hands."

542
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,600
Boom, done.

543
00:30:10,127 --> 00:30:12,021
Now if you wake him up,
he'll fix it.

544
00:30:15,082 --> 00:30:16,685
He made up for all this?

545
00:30:17,706 --> 00:30:19,090
Maybe he really is good.

546
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,864
This is great. Now,

547
00:30:21,024 --> 00:30:23,283
we can get back to doing
the Lord's business.

548
00:30:23,746 --> 00:30:26,619
We won't have to skimp
by the food I took from work.

549
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:30,742
Hold on a second.

550
00:30:31,544 --> 00:30:32,625
What about you?

551
00:30:33,004 --> 00:30:35,587
- Do you have a list, too?
- I don't need a list.

552
00:30:35,747 --> 00:30:37,823
I may have jacked up
some people now and then,

553
00:30:37,943 --> 00:30:40,008
but only
when they damn well had it coming.

554
00:30:40,538 --> 00:30:42,093
How do I know she's not evil?

555
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:43,850
One: I'm American.

556
00:30:44,622 --> 00:30:47,109
Two: I saw all my pregnancies
through to the end.

557
00:30:47,229 --> 00:30:51,311
And three: nobody can look this good
without the lord on her side.

558
00:30:51,471 --> 00:30:53,271
Unless they have the evil on their side.

559
00:30:53,431 --> 00:30:56,228
I'm not gonna even dignify
that comment with a response,

560
00:30:56,348 --> 00:30:58,318
you little lying bat-faced Bible freak.

561
00:30:58,478 --> 00:31:00,361
Blaspheming Jezebel!

562
00:31:00,521 --> 00:31:03,239
- Tiny pecker!
- I'm gonna go listen to Christian rock.

563
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:04,649
I need a smoke.

564
00:31:07,882 --> 00:31:09,551
So what do we do now?

565
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:12,122
Is there any way you boys
can prove to my son

566
00:31:12,242 --> 00:31:13,833
that that lady is a good person?

567
00:31:14,444 --> 00:31:15,524
God's Little Finger?

568
00:31:15,644 --> 00:31:18,159
More like God's Middle Finger,
and you're pointing it at yourself.

569
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:20,590
How's that feel?
I'll be in the car.

570
00:31:22,798 --> 00:31:24,493
It's going to be though.

571
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:30,363
Brain waves are minimal,
heart rate is at 20,

572
00:31:30,483 --> 00:31:32,570
but his internal organs
are all top shelf.

573
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,104
So let's get
this transplan draft started.

574
00:31:35,695 --> 00:31:38,149
Dr. Fujimoto, since you haven't
saved a patient in three weeks,

575
00:31:38,309 --> 00:31:39,869
you get first pick.

576
00:31:39,989 --> 00:31:41,887
I want his gall bladder.

577
00:31:42,522 --> 00:31:44,864
Fuj, what are you doing?

578
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:47,808
You always take the liver
in the first round.

579
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:49,776
<i>My condition was getting worse,</i>

580
00:31:49,896 --> 00:31:52,705
<i>and in my coma mind,
things were changing, too.</i>

581
00:31:54,328 --> 00:31:56,471
That is fantastic news, sir.

582
00:31:58,931 --> 00:32:01,883
A raise and
an expense account at Montgomy Ward?

583
00:32:02,357 --> 00:32:04,861
I'll talk to my wife about it right now.

584
00:32:05,396 --> 00:32:07,720
About what? Two-three-four.

585
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:11,724
You're looking at the new vice president
of Slathery and Mather.

586
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,467
You got a promotion.

587
00:32:14,587 --> 00:32:16,563
Oh, honey, that's wonderful.

588
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:18,598
But it'll mean moving away.

589
00:32:19,131 --> 00:32:20,080
For good.

590
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,777
And leaving all my friends and family.

591
00:32:30,361 --> 00:32:33,319
<i>Since Gerald had seen
a video of Joy doing bad things,</i>

592
00:32:33,439 --> 00:32:36,455
<i>Darnell wanted to show
some videos of Joy doing good things,</i>

593
00:32:36,575 --> 00:32:37,624
<i>which didn't exist.</i>

594
00:32:37,744 --> 00:32:39,600
I thought you said
this was going to look like

595
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,867
I was standing in front
of an Alaskan oil spill.

596
00:32:41,987 --> 00:32:44,215
This is just our big, blue sex tarp.

597
00:32:44,981 --> 00:32:46,634
We've had picnics on this.

598
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,929
Trust me. Back in the day, I could make
one hell of a propaganda video.

599
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:51,365
Although, I'll admit

600
00:32:51,485 --> 00:32:53,860
my previous successes
were with Third World villagers.

601
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,157
They'll believe anything
if you give them a soda pop

602
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:58,271
and a glow-in-the-dark Frisbee.

603
00:33:00,364 --> 00:33:01,928
To prove that Joy is not evil,

604
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:04,235
we put together this reel
of Joy news highlights

605
00:33:04,395 --> 00:33:08,197
which we feel greatly outweighs
her one unfortunate news lowlight.

606
00:33:12,005 --> 00:33:13,912
I wish we could wait for Carter.

607
00:33:14,072 --> 00:33:17,832
He's been tired up with those beavers
that took over the water park.

608
00:33:17,992 --> 00:33:21,002
<i>All right, y'all, let's get this beach
and all the animals cleaned up.</i>

609
00:33:21,162 --> 00:33:23,796
<i>But save the oil,
we can put it in cars.</i>

610
00:33:23,956 --> 00:33:28,456
<i>No, thanks, I'll not drink another drop
of water until breast cancer is cured.</i>

611
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:31,095
<i>I saved a thousand yuckets.
Find a cure.</i>

612
00:33:33,447 --> 00:33:36,365
<i>Yes, sir, mission accomplished.
Great job, Maverick.</i>

613
00:33:36,485 --> 00:33:37,841
<i>Way to go, Goose.</i>

614
00:33:38,846 --> 00:33:41,891
<i>Don't worry, kid, I got your puppy
and I'm gonna swim for help.</i>

615
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:45,151
<i>Make sure you stay in that air bule
underneath the bumper pool table.</i>

616
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:48,312
<i>I just think that dogs and
cats should be neutered,</i>

617
00:33:48,432 --> 00:33:51,467
<i>and if you would jump on this with me,
we could really make difference.</i>

618
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:57,937
<i>In reply to the Vice President,
I sent him the following wire...</i>

619
00:33:58,057 --> 00:33:59,217
<i>Vice President Nixon.</i>

620
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,835
<i>Vice President Nixon,
Los Angeles, California.</i>

621
00:34:01,955 --> 00:34:04,734
<i>- Your sincere good wishes.
- Your sincere good wishes</i>

622
00:34:04,854 --> 00:34:07,137
<i>- are gratefully accepted.
- You are to be congratuled.</i>

623
00:34:07,257 --> 00:34:10,305
<i>You are to be congratuled
on a fine race.</i>

624
00:34:11,185 --> 00:34:12,345
<i>I know that...</i>

625
00:34:20,786 --> 00:34:21,729
Let's do it.

626
00:34:23,516 --> 00:34:26,004
I hope your father gets here
in time to watch you.

627
00:34:26,124 --> 00:34:28,778
Left a voice mail.
Darn beavers.

628
00:34:28,938 --> 00:34:32,145
One, two, three, four.
I declare a thumb war.

629
00:34:32,567 --> 00:34:33,770
I win again.

630
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:36,285
Get out of the way!
Magic boy, magic hands!

631
00:34:39,781 --> 00:34:41,416
The power of the Lord within me,

632
00:34:41,622 --> 00:34:45,106
The power of the Lord within me!
It's charging up, it's charging up!

633
00:34:45,226 --> 00:34:47,588
Enough with the showmanship,
just touch him with the finger, E.T.

634
00:34:47,748 --> 00:34:50,341
- You're gonna make him start over.
- Here we go now.

635
00:34:51,092 --> 00:34:52,802
The spirit's rising.

636
00:34:53,059 --> 00:34:56,189
- I call dibs on the first hug.
- Rising, Rising! Are you ready?

637
00:34:56,309 --> 00:34:58,433
It's rising! Rising!

638
00:34:58,593 --> 00:35:01,185
- God's Little Finger says...
- No! Don't!

639
00:35:02,549 --> 00:35:03,896
Don't do it, Gerald.

640
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:06,943
Why not? I'm back in business
like you wanted, Dad.

641
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:07,920
Watch.

642
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,528
God's Little Finger says heal!

643
00:35:14,358 --> 00:35:15,632
Try it again.

644
00:35:17,247 --> 00:35:19,521
God's Little Finger says heal!

645
00:35:24,795 --> 00:35:27,378
It's not working.
It's all this medicine.

646
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:28,755
We can't have true faith

647
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:31,132
when we're still depending
on all these machines.

648
00:35:32,084 --> 00:35:34,093
Unplug him! Unplug everything!

649
00:35:35,171 --> 00:35:35,887
Stop!

650
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:41,392
You can't heal people, Gerald.

651
00:35:41,749 --> 00:35:43,752
This hole thing has been a scam.

652
00:35:45,123 --> 00:35:47,657
<i>After five years
of believing he had powers,</i>

653
00:35:47,777 --> 00:35:50,046
<i>Gerald was finally going
to learn the truth.</i>

654
00:35:50,166 --> 00:35:51,263
<i>A few years back,</i>

655
00:35:51,383 --> 00:35:54,174
<i>Gerald's dad was trying anything
he could to make a quick buck.</i>

656
00:35:54,294 --> 00:35:56,055
Hello, this is Ed from the bank.

657
00:35:56,175 --> 00:35:58,419
Could you give me
your account number, please?

658
00:36:00,388 --> 00:36:01,241
Damn it.

659
00:36:01,556 --> 00:36:04,956
<i>When out of the clear blue sky,
he was hit with an idea.</i>

660
00:36:08,558 --> 00:36:09,358
Idiot.

661
00:36:12,813 --> 00:36:14,881
Poor thing. It's dead.

662
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:17,804
Gerald, don't touch it.
That's how your uncle got AIDS.

663
00:36:24,729 --> 00:36:25,978
Oh, my Lord.

664
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:32,915
It's a miracle!

665
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:35,279
That bird was as dead as a doornail,

666
00:36:35,439 --> 00:36:37,630
and my son brought it back to life.

667
00:36:37,750 --> 00:36:41,892
He is an agent of the Lord!
Get out your checkbooks!

668
00:36:42,405 --> 00:36:45,872
<i>By the time we went to see Gerald,
the miracle business is booming.</i>

669
00:36:49,494 --> 00:36:50,768
<i>But as it turned out,</i>

670
00:36:50,888 --> 00:36:53,464
<i>Gerald's dad needed a little help
to keep the miracles coming.</i>

671
00:36:53,684 --> 00:36:54,951
Hey, dirt bag.

672
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:57,593
Want to make some real money?

673
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:00,471
Hang on, hang on.

674
00:37:00,631 --> 00:37:01,848
Let me see you limp.

675
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:07,131
Okay, but you're only going
to look, right?

676
00:37:08,265 --> 00:37:10,189
I meant walk with a limp.

677
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,917
<i>If Joy knew it was a scam,
she would've made me split the money,</i>

678
00:37:20,037 --> 00:37:22,910
<i>so I told them I tripped
on some Japanese twins.</i>

679
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,987
<i>Plus, I couldn't ruin
the night for Randy.</i>

680
00:37:25,107 --> 00:37:26,638
<i>I hadn't seen that look on his face</i>

681
00:37:26,758 --> 00:37:29,250
<i>since I blew his mind
with the magic of "Got Your Nose."</i>

682
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,150
So...

683
00:37:30,937 --> 00:37:32,753
his powers only work on birds?

684
00:37:32,961 --> 00:37:36,154
No, that's not true.
'Cause he touched my monster zip,

685
00:37:36,274 --> 00:37:38,342
and the next morning,
it was drying up on the pillow.

686
00:37:38,502 --> 00:37:39,957
Yeah, I used to put some...

687
00:37:40,077 --> 00:37:42,889
pharmaceutical-grade
Neosporin on the kid's hands.

688
00:37:43,049 --> 00:37:44,932
Carter, how could you lie to us?

689
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:48,936
How could you lie and cheat sick people
out of thousands of dollars?

690
00:37:50,662 --> 00:37:51,564
I'm done.

691
00:37:52,933 --> 00:37:54,836
I don't have powers anymore.

692
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,341
I'm done.

693
00:37:58,154 --> 00:38:00,406
Look, I'm sorry
I couldn't heal your brother but...

694
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:04,990
This is great.
I can finally be a normal kid.

695
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:07,121
What's so great about that?

696
00:38:07,281 --> 00:38:08,708
Everything, Dad.

697
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:11,546
I wear plastic gloves on my hands.

698
00:38:11,666 --> 00:38:12,908
To school.

699
00:38:13,232 --> 00:38:16,130
And the only people who talk to me
are the cafeteria ladies.

700
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:19,667
You can cross

701
00:38:19,787 --> 00:38:22,011
"Made a healer boy
scared of his own powers"

702
00:38:22,292 --> 00:38:23,596
of Earl's list.

703
00:38:23,756 --> 00:38:25,598
I didn't like having them to begin with.

704
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,424
Gerald, let's go.

705
00:38:31,114 --> 00:38:33,909
So I got free passes to the water park.

706
00:38:34,029 --> 00:38:35,191
Beavers are gone.

707
00:38:40,849 --> 00:38:42,237
I'm sorry, Earl.

708
00:38:42,649 --> 00:38:45,637
I really thought his magic finger
was really gonna help.

709
00:38:51,905 --> 00:38:52,875
Come on, guys.

710
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:54,723
Let's leave them alone.

711
00:38:58,931 --> 00:39:02,093
Get the hell out of here!
Go! Go! Go on!

712
00:39:11,436 --> 00:39:12,979
Well, I guess this is goodbye.

713
00:39:13,449 --> 00:39:15,147
I don't want you to go.

714
00:39:15,952 --> 00:39:17,306
I have to, buddy.

715
00:39:19,695 --> 00:39:22,841
Everlast Car Service.
Pick up for Earl Hickey.

716
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:28,661
All right.

717
00:39:29,385 --> 00:39:31,171
So long everyone.

718
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:42,717
I'm sorry I've made you do
that inter-invention.

719
00:39:43,754 --> 00:39:46,047
They look like a lot more fun on TV.

720
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:50,224
And I'm sorry
Karma got so mad at you

721
00:39:50,384 --> 00:39:53,720
for throwing away your list
that it hit you with a car again.

722
00:39:58,129 --> 00:40:00,359
I wish you never would have made
this stupid list.

723
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:03,034
Maybe our lives
wouldn't have gotten any better,

724
00:40:03,154 --> 00:40:05,031
but at least,
you wouldn't be leaving me.

725
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,077
But I know how important it was to you.

726
00:40:15,871 --> 00:40:19,456
Maybe you didn't finish it,
but you crossed a lot of things off.

727
00:40:23,454 --> 00:40:26,406
I hope you crossed enough off
to get into Heaven.

728
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,975
Let me cross off Gerald, too.

729
00:40:30,502 --> 00:40:33,142
Maybe God will give you
an extra dessert for each one you did.

730
00:40:45,749 --> 00:40:46,739
The list?

731
00:40:47,991 --> 00:40:50,910
<i>Right then, Randy realized
the answer wasn't the kid,</i>

732
00:40:51,298 --> 00:40:52,745
<i>it was making up to the kid.</i>

733
00:40:53,509 --> 00:40:54,546
The list.

734
00:40:56,199 --> 00:40:58,527
"N45: Wasted electricity."

735
00:41:04,864 --> 00:41:06,967
I can't do it. I'm staying.

736
00:41:09,908 --> 00:41:11,349
That's hot.

737
