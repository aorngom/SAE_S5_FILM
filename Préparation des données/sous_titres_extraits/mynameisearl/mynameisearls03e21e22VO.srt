1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:02,294
CAMDENITES

2
00:00:02,749 --> 00:00:06,218
<i>Ever since I started doing the list,
it'd just been me and Randy,</i>

3
00:00:06,338 --> 00:00:08,490
<i>but now my new wife Billie made three.</i>

4
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,708
Mmm, watch this.

5
00:00:09,828 --> 00:00:12,207
There's this part coming up
that's really funny.

6
00:00:12,327 --> 00:00:15,368
<i>And I was starting to understand
the expression "Three's a crowd."</i>

7
00:00:15,488 --> 00:00:18,051
He's gonna think that it's
his wife licking his leg,

8
00:00:18,171 --> 00:00:20,773
but it's really gonna be the dog.
Watch, watch.

9
00:00:24,652 --> 00:00:27,072
Yep, there it is, just like you said.

10
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:29,949
Thanks for telling me,
so I could be ready for it.

11
00:00:30,544 --> 00:00:33,547
<i>And the way we watched TV
wasn't the only change.</i>

12
00:00:33,947 --> 00:00:35,452
<i>I used to drive my own car,</i>

13
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:39,151
<i>but Billie thought I drove like a girl,
so she insisted on doing it herself.</i>

14
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:44,381
You better take five steps
backwards right now, bitch.

15
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:46,758
<i>Unfortunately, she had
a problem with road rage.</i>

16
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:49,607
Just forget it, it's gone. Go!

17
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,484
<i>And I used to have my own money,</i>

18
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:57,930
<i>but I spent it
throwing an arsonist a prison prom.</i>

19
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,939
<i>And while it was an enchanted evening,
it left me broken,</i>

20
00:01:01,059 --> 00:01:02,893
<i>and I was now living off Billie.</i>

21
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,194
- How many tissues you got there?
- Two.

22
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:08,907
How many times
you gonna blow your nose?

23
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,926
One.

24
00:01:10,046 --> 00:01:12,627
You might want to check your math,
Mr. Rockefeller.

25
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:16,278
<i>And because Billie's money
also paid for the room,</i>

26
00:01:16,398 --> 00:01:18,697
<i>she got to decide
the sleeping arrangements.</i>

27
00:01:18,817 --> 00:01:20,625
Of course he can stay with us, Earl.

28
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,127
He's family.

29
00:01:22,287 --> 00:01:24,796
He's just gonna have to be
an outside brother.

30
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:39,464
<i>My favorite part of the day was
when Billie took a shower,</i>

31
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,047
<i>until she started singing.</i>

32
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,234
I don't get it, Randy.
I just don't get it.

33
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:49,571
Why would Karma want me to be
with a woman who's driving me crazy?

34
00:01:49,885 --> 00:01:52,667
You should just cut her head off
like that King of England dude,

35
00:01:52,787 --> 00:01:54,576
or the guy who used to live downstairs.

36
00:01:54,795 --> 00:01:57,704
It's not that easy.
Billie's supposed to be my reward.

37
00:01:57,947 --> 00:02:01,093
Karma brought her into my life to show
me that I was doing things right.

38
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:04,741
- You don't return a gift like that.
- You do if she makes you sleep outside.

39
00:02:04,861 --> 00:02:07,059
I got sprayed by a cat last night.

40
00:02:07,489 --> 00:02:10,336
Which is a lie, it wasn't a cat.
It was a grown man.

41
00:02:10,456 --> 00:02:12,093
I was too embarrassed to say that.

42
00:02:12,344 --> 00:02:15,842
I know Billie's a handful,
but I'm sure Karma has its reasons.

43
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:19,295
Not to mention, before Billie hit me
with her car, her life was a mess.

44
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,313
I can't let her go back to that.

45
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:32,776
I'm gonna go sleep on the balcony.

46
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:36,644
I kind of made friends with
that Filipino grandmother from room 206.

47
00:02:36,764 --> 00:02:38,740
They won't let her sleep inside either.

48
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,749
<i>I couldn't help but think about
how different my reality was,</i>

49
00:02:41,869 --> 00:02:43,169
<i>compared to my fantasy.</i>

50
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:46,709
<i>When I was in a coma,
my relationship with Billie was perfect.</i>

51
00:02:47,413 --> 00:02:50,279
<i>She made me cakes,
she brought me lemonade,</i>

52
00:02:50,625 --> 00:02:53,180
<i>and when she kissed me,
even her leg got excited.</i>

53
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:57,371
<i>I wondered why Karma brought me out of
my coma only to make me more miserable,</i>

54
00:02:57,491 --> 00:03:00,539
<i>and I wondered, was it just gonna get
worse for the rest of my life?</i>

55
00:03:00,659 --> 00:03:03,853
There's nothing like a crap
and a shower to make you feel better.

56
00:03:05,595 --> 00:03:07,941
I think I'm just gonna go for a walk.

57
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:12,654
<i>I married Billie 'cause I trusted Karma.</i>

58
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:14,814
<i>Karma had never let me down before,</i>

59
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:18,111
<i>but every day that went by
made me lose a little more faith.</i>

60
00:03:19,612 --> 00:03:22,392
I did 25 minutes at level six.

61
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,499
If you can't beat me, you're a wuss.

62
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,501
Come on, faster.

63
00:03:27,912 --> 00:03:30,255
If we want to grow old together,
we need to be healthy.

64
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:33,029
<i>Yep, this marriage
was definitely a mystery.</i>

65
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,640
<i>I needed some advice,</i>

66
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,093
<i>so I went to see
the smartest person I knew.</i>

67
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:41,520
<i>There was a reason Joy
and Darnell's trailer was on its side</i>

68
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,769
<i>a while back, me and some friends
broke in to have a party.</i>

69
00:03:45,485 --> 00:03:47,966
<i>Normally, when you have beer
and strippers in a trailer,</i>

70
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:49,262
<i> you tip the strippers.</i>

71
00:03:49,382 --> 00:03:51,924
<i>We went another way
and tipped the trailer.</i>

72
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:12,133
I really am sorry
about this whole trailer thing.

73
00:04:12,253 --> 00:04:14,900
Ah, don't sweat it, Earl.
I kind of like it.

74
00:04:15,201 --> 00:04:17,856
Besides, with the grass
growing out of the floor,

75
00:04:17,976 --> 00:04:19,846
Mr. Turtle has his own little park.

76
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,604
Never seen him
wag his little tail before.

77
00:04:27,764 --> 00:04:29,731
Yeah, I'm happy for him.

78
00:04:30,822 --> 00:04:33,555
Listen, I need to ask you
a marriage question.

79
00:04:33,921 --> 00:04:36,529
How do you handle being married
to someone who's difficult?

80
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:37,955
Try this.

81
00:04:40,726 --> 00:04:43,202
I just write down
everything Joy does that bothers me.

82
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:46,135
Most psychologists will tell you
to express your thoughts and feelings

83
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:47,924
without fear of confrontation.

84
00:04:48,044 --> 00:04:51,336
These are individuals I call
"people who have not met Joy."

85
00:04:51,761 --> 00:04:54,464
Earl, you gotta flip
this trailer right-side-up.

86
00:04:54,697 --> 00:04:57,015
I got so many bruises
from climbing through this door,

87
00:04:57,135 --> 00:04:59,192
I look like a woman
in a Lifetime movie.

88
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:01,413
I'm gonna do it, Joy.
I just need to figure out

89
00:05:01,533 --> 00:05:03,556
how to get some money
from Billie to rent a crane.

90
00:05:03,842 --> 00:05:05,874
One way would be to grow some nads.

91
00:05:05,994 --> 00:05:07,453
Speaking of being nadless...

92
00:05:07,573 --> 00:05:10,063
Darnell, are you showing Earl
your poetry books?

93
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:13,631
Yeah, we were having a poetry slam.

94
00:05:13,751 --> 00:05:14,962
Let me read one.

95
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:20,406
"Today, she hit a new low.

96
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:24,076
"Got mad cooking dinner
and threw the chicken on the lawn.

97
00:05:24,237 --> 00:05:26,287
"Once again, I see
why everyone in our trailer park

98
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:29,322
"despises her
and wishes we would move."

99
00:05:34,165 --> 00:05:36,839
That's a terrible poem, Darnell.
It don't even rhyme.

100
00:05:39,535 --> 00:05:41,678
Remember that time
I threw a chicken on the lawn.

101
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:45,498
You should write a poem about that,
but make it rhyme.

102
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:53,106
- Did you pee a little?
- Yep.

103
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,440
Me, too.

104
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,778
<i>While I was getting advice
about my wife,</i>

105
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,987
<i>Randy was being tortured by her.</i>

106
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:03,282
Can I have a Klondike Bar, please?

107
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,756
That depends...

108
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:07,328
<i>What would you do for a Klondike Bar?</i>

109
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,164
Nah, seen it.

110
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:22,552
<i>Unfortunately for Randy,
the motel was next to a costume shop.</i>

111
00:06:22,712 --> 00:06:24,804
Would you like to buy
some delicious cookies?

112
00:06:39,338 --> 00:06:42,113
Two slim mint and
three peanut butter sandwich.

113
00:06:43,525 --> 00:06:44,290
Now?

114
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,368
Almost.

115
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:49,911
<i>And, unfortunately for Randy,
the motel was also next to a street.</i>

116
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:52,173
You loser!

117
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,092
Enjoy.

118
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,812
<i>I rescued Randy
and continued my quest</i>

119
00:07:13,932 --> 00:07:16,809
<i>for relationship advice by going
to the happiest couple I knew.</i>

120
00:07:17,475 --> 00:07:19,215
The most important thing is

121
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,444
to take your time with foreplay.

122
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:24,592
"All work and no foreplay
makes Jack a dull boy."

123
00:07:24,712 --> 00:07:26,449
I got that from a <i>Will & Grace</i> rerun.

124
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,230
You start by lightly trailing
your fingers down your lover's chest.

125
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,735
Let him know that you want him.

126
00:07:32,855 --> 00:07:34,624
Let the love flow.
Call him "lover."

127
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:38,121
Call your lover "lover"
as often as possible.

128
00:07:38,603 --> 00:07:39,592
Whisper it.

129
00:07:40,567 --> 00:07:41,332
Lover.

130
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:44,841
Lover.

131
00:07:45,946 --> 00:07:46,719
Lover.

132
00:07:47,108 --> 00:07:47,924
Lover.

133
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:54,572
They have just as much right
to kiss in public as anyone else.

134
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:55,853
Which one's the girl?

135
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:58,727
I don't know
how this stuff works, Randy, I...

136
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:00,799
Oh, looks like it's Kenny.

137
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:02,777
<i>My gay pals sure seemed happy,</i>

138
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:05,326
<i>so I decided to take their advice.</i>

139
00:08:05,446 --> 00:08:09,367
I love foreplaying with you, lover.
You're such a good lover.

140
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:15,581
Not on the menu.

141
00:08:15,741 --> 00:08:18,501
I figured from the way you were talking,
you might be into a little bit of...

142
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:20,570
Nope, you are mistaken.

143
00:08:21,632 --> 00:08:23,932
<i>That was just the poke
I need to continue the search</i>

144
00:08:24,052 --> 00:08:25,753
<i>for a way to make my marriage work.</i>

145
00:08:25,873 --> 00:08:29,237
<i>So I decided to talk to the person who
had made a marriage work the longest.</i>

146
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:31,931
Earl, I'm just...
I am just so excited

147
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:34,744
that you'd come to me
for marriage advice.

148
00:08:34,864 --> 00:08:37,854
Okay, first off,
do you call each other "lover"?

149
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:40,481
Yeah, once.
Not my cup of tea.

150
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:44,193
And you know about the foreplay
and finding the G-spot?

151
00:08:44,353 --> 00:08:45,589
Is Dad here?

152
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:47,666
'Cause I may be better off
talking to him.

153
00:08:47,786 --> 00:08:49,861
Dad's working late at the shop again.

154
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:52,034
And when you figure
that this is the last night

155
00:08:52,195 --> 00:08:55,043
we have to decide
on the fabric for the new drapes...

156
00:08:56,444 --> 00:08:59,571
Actually, maybe
you could give me some advice.

157
00:08:59,691 --> 00:09:01,607
I don't really know
anything about fabrics.

158
00:09:01,727 --> 00:09:03,462
Just tell me which one you like.

159
00:09:03,622 --> 00:09:04,755
The middle one.

160
00:09:05,035 --> 00:09:06,549
Why would you pick that one?

161
00:09:06,757 --> 00:09:08,301
I don't know, it looks nice.

162
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:11,304
- Nicer than the first one?
- Okay, I like the first one.

163
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:14,394
Oh, see...
see, now you're just saying that.

164
00:09:15,386 --> 00:09:18,102
This is gonna be the last time
that we redecorate this house, Earl.

165
00:09:18,348 --> 00:09:20,855
These are going to be
the drapes that I die looking at.

166
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:24,275
You don't care enough about me
to give me your honest opinion?

167
00:09:24,529 --> 00:09:25,233
No...

168
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:27,486
<i>Dad was lucky he wasn't home for this,</i>

169
00:09:27,606 --> 00:09:30,615
<i>but then I started to realize
Dad was lucky like this a lot.</i>

170
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:34,312
<i>Like how he missed all of Mom's
wednesday night dinner adventures.</i>

171
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:37,121
Well, we're not waiting
for your father any longer.

172
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:41,459
Tonight's voyage... Asia.

173
00:09:41,619 --> 00:09:44,666
And not the American version either,
real Asian food...

174
00:09:44,786 --> 00:09:45,671
crickets.

175
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:51,077
Pure protein.

176
00:09:52,046 --> 00:09:53,568
<i>Our annual family portrait.</i>

177
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:55,640
There's an emergency
at the framing shop.

178
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:59,267
Apparently,
all the 5x7 frames came in 7x5.

179
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,949
Your father's going
to be there all night.

180
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:04,106
We're gonna take
the white picture without him.

181
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:07,235
- Can my gerbil be in the picture?
- Is he white?

182
00:10:07,395 --> 00:10:09,957
<i>Or every year
when my mom wanted us to go caroling.</i>

183
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:11,493
I'm sorry, boys.

184
00:10:11,613 --> 00:10:14,909
Your father has to work late again.
Five nights in a row.

185
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:18,127
We're just going to have
to do it without him.

186
00:10:18,247 --> 00:10:20,998
Or we could just blow it off
and watch TV.

187
00:10:21,158 --> 00:10:23,883
Oh, silly.
Come on, big smiles,

188
00:10:24,003 --> 00:10:26,462
and get your umbrella,
it's pouring rain out there.

189
00:10:32,206 --> 00:10:35,554
<i>I knew then that Dad didn't just happen
to miss certain things with my mom,</i>

190
00:10:35,714 --> 00:10:37,492
<i>he avoided them on purpose.</i>

191
00:10:37,612 --> 00:10:40,434
<i>He threw himself into his job
to make his marriage work.</i>

192
00:10:40,594 --> 00:10:42,228
<i>It hit me that I need to do the same,</i>

193
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:45,231
<i>only my job wasn't framing,
it was the list.</i>

194
00:10:45,391 --> 00:10:47,692
<i>I guess I'd find out if it worked.</i>

195
00:10:47,852 --> 00:10:49,854
You missed
the Ethiopian adventure last night.

196
00:10:49,974 --> 00:10:53,239
- I got pickled ox tail.
- Gotta go. Something on the list.

197
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,729
<i>Dad was a genius.</i>

198
00:11:00,466 --> 00:11:02,943
<i>I'd finally found a way
to get along with my wife:</i>

199
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,163
<i>by avoiding her.</i>

200
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:07,851
<i>So like a lot of husbands,
I decided to spend all my time at work,</i>

201
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:10,367
<i>which for me meant
finding something to do on my list.</i>

202
00:11:10,487 --> 00:11:13,086
Here's a good one, Earl.
N°275:

203
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,511
"Never bought Randy a Ferrari."

204
00:11:16,626 --> 00:11:17,930
Or n°276:

205
00:11:18,231 --> 00:11:21,117
"Never told chicks
Randy was a fighter pilot."

206
00:11:22,275 --> 00:11:23,561
Okay, n°277...

207
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:26,272
Randy, how many of these
did you add when I was in a coma?

208
00:11:27,075 --> 00:11:27,838
Zero.

209
00:11:28,393 --> 00:11:29,162
Fifty.

210
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:30,860
That's it, Earl.

211
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,057
I'm done waiting for you
to flip my house back.

212
00:11:33,177 --> 00:11:35,659
I was walking past our ceiling fan,
which is now on our wall,

213
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,826
and it lopped off one of my ponytails.
You owe me 25 bucks.

214
00:11:39,453 --> 00:11:41,400
I told you, I need money for a crane,

215
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,831
and Billie's just getting stingier.

216
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:49,592
What, did you buy stock
in the toothpaste company?

217
00:11:49,712 --> 00:11:52,131
I'll save some of it for the morning.

218
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:58,525
It didn't sound that wet.

219
00:12:01,883 --> 00:12:04,567
You just gonna let some bitchy woman
make your decisions for you?

220
00:12:04,687 --> 00:12:06,687
If you had any self-respect,
you'd do what I say.

221
00:12:06,847 --> 00:12:09,759
<i>I didn't get it.
Karma's mystery was getting deeper.</i>

222
00:12:10,295 --> 00:12:12,788
<i>I was doing the list to get away
from my nightmare of a wife,</i>

223
00:12:12,908 --> 00:12:15,571
<i>only to have Karma stick me
with my nightmare of an ex-wife.</i>

224
00:12:15,731 --> 00:12:18,616
Then I'm gonna take my foot out,
and put it back in again, deeper!

225
00:12:20,027 --> 00:12:22,203
Joy, I want to help you,
I just don't know how.

226
00:12:23,172 --> 00:12:25,208
If we were ants,
we wouldn't need a crane.

227
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,176
We could lift
a million times our weight.

228
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:30,336
Ants are so ripped.
They must get laid all the time.

229
00:12:30,496 --> 00:12:34,099
<i>Randy had a good point,
not just about ants boning a lot.</i>

230
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,133
<i>Ants also worked as a team.</i>

231
00:12:36,592 --> 00:12:38,135
Come on, everybody, pull!

232
00:12:38,563 --> 00:12:41,353
<i>When I was doing bad things,
no one would help me with anything.</i>

233
00:12:41,473 --> 00:12:43,287
<i>But now that I was doing good things,</i>

234
00:12:43,407 --> 00:12:45,267
<i>I had lots of friends
willing to pitch in.</i>

235
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,229
Come on, pull, you lazy bastards!

236
00:12:50,974 --> 00:12:52,411
You are so Spartacus.

237
00:12:52,531 --> 00:12:54,725
No, no, you are so Spartacus.

238
00:12:54,845 --> 00:12:56,570
- You are.
- Oh, no, you are.

239
00:12:58,952 --> 00:13:00,404
Rhino in my back!

240
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:02,739
This is how my father died!

241
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:06,658
Come on, people!
Let's put some muscle into it.

242
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:11,501
I am so sorry.

243
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:13,421
It's coming! It's coming!

244
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:15,005
Keep pulling.

245
00:13:15,165 --> 00:13:16,172
Pull!

246
00:13:16,292 --> 00:13:17,527
It's coming.

247
00:13:18,439 --> 00:13:19,635
Keep pulling.

248
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:32,654
Thank you so much, everybody.

249
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:35,365
I got pony kegs in the side yard.

250
00:13:35,485 --> 00:13:36,347
Enjoy.

251
00:13:40,441 --> 00:13:42,047
Help!

252
00:13:42,167 --> 00:13:43,951
My foot is stuck.

253
00:13:44,111 --> 00:13:46,640
<i>It was great to see
everyone pulling together like that...</i>

254
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,645
<i>and pull together like that.</i>

255
00:13:48,765 --> 00:13:51,274
<i>Plus, I was successfully
staying away from Billie.</i>

256
00:13:51,394 --> 00:13:53,872
<i>It was my first real good day
since I got married.</i>

257
00:13:53,992 --> 00:13:55,938
Hey, Earl, your wife's on the phone.

258
00:13:56,058 --> 00:13:58,747
I told her you were drinking a beer
and she got really mad.

259
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:03,508
Hey, honey.

260
00:14:04,248 --> 00:14:06,679
No, he's crazy, it's just a soda.

261
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,100
God, I miss you. What's up?

262
00:14:08,726 --> 00:14:11,340
I ordered a bunch of stuff to go
from Chubby's Pulled Pork,

263
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,040
and I need you to pick it up.

264
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,470
Feel free to get something for yourself.

265
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,234
Just stay on the left side of the menu.

266
00:14:17,394 --> 00:14:19,790
Oh, man,
I really love that dinner salad,

267
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,855
but work's crazy. Gotta go.
Don't wait up. Love you!

268
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:24,880
<i>I need to pick another list item,</i>

269
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,623
<i>but before I could,
Karma picked one for me.</i>

270
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:30,331
Oh, my God, Earl!
I found a leg!

271
00:14:31,609 --> 00:14:33,792
God, not another body.

272
00:14:34,077 --> 00:14:36,219
This is not a graveyard, people!

273
00:14:36,339 --> 00:14:39,089
Pony up for your grandparents
to have a decent funeral!

274
00:14:39,249 --> 00:14:42,302
It's nobody's grandparent.
It's not even a real leg.

275
00:14:42,572 --> 00:14:43,939
<i>I knew it was fake,</i>

276
00:14:44,059 --> 00:14:47,347
<i>because I had ditched it
under the trailer after committing n°86:</i>

277
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:49,711
"Stole a car from a one-legged girl."

278
00:14:50,344 --> 00:14:51,295
Stand back!

279
00:14:51,415 --> 00:14:53,646
<i>I wish I could say
it was only her car I stole.</i>

280
00:14:54,409 --> 00:14:56,369
You said you loved me!

281
00:14:58,422 --> 00:14:59,910
It doesn't make sense.

282
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:02,676
I'm doing the list to keep away
from one nightmare woman,

283
00:15:02,796 --> 00:15:05,632
Karma sends me to deal with Joy,
another nightmare woman.

284
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:09,075
Now, it's sending me Didi,
the biggest nightmare I've ever met.

285
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:10,579
What the hell's going on?

286
00:15:10,699 --> 00:15:12,782
Sometimes I wish Karma could talk.

287
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:15,209
That'd take a lot of guesswork out
of what we do.

288
00:15:15,697 --> 00:15:18,007
But if I only had one wish in the world,

289
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:21,125
I'd be an ant
who was ripped and got laid a lot.

290
00:15:21,489 --> 00:15:23,388
Hopefully, I'll get two wishes.

291
00:15:23,961 --> 00:15:26,929
<i>I was wishing for something different:
that I wouldn't be killed by Didi.</i>

292
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:29,080
<i>I figured we'd go by where she worked,</i>

293
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,904
<i>so she'd have less chance
of having her shotgun.</i>

294
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:36,901
Excuse me,
I found a leg in my doughnut.

295
00:15:37,021 --> 00:15:39,207
Come on.
Maybe we'll get a free doughnut.

296
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:42,637
I know we came from a keg party,
but try to act sober, okay?

297
00:15:43,397 --> 00:15:44,363
That's hot.

298
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,699
Freshest doughnuts in town,
you son of a bitch.

299
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:48,503
<i>After some discussion,</i>

300
00:15:48,623 --> 00:15:50,660
<i>I learned Didi already had her car back</i>

301
00:15:51,029 --> 00:15:54,123
<i>and didn't just want her leg,
she wanted me to feel her pain.</i>

302
00:15:54,704 --> 00:15:57,743
<i>And if I was gonna figure out
what Karma was trying to tell me,</i>

303
00:15:57,863 --> 00:15:59,836
<i>I guess I had to do what she said.</i>

304
00:15:59,956 --> 00:16:02,590
I want you to hop a mile in my shoe.

305
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,656
<i>I never thought
about how hard I made Didi's life</i>

306
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,368
<i>by stealing her fake leg.</i>

307
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:12,919
<i>But she made me understand</i>

308
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:15,656
<i>how the simple things in life
became complicated,</i>

309
00:16:15,776 --> 00:16:17,313
<i>like bringing home groceries.</i>

310
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:20,708
<i>Getting them to the door wasn't too bad,</i>

311
00:16:20,828 --> 00:16:23,995
<i>but freeing up a hand to open it
put too much weight on one side.</i>

312
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:28,712
<i>And, like how the lights are set
to give people enough time</i>

313
00:16:28,832 --> 00:16:30,925
<i>to walk across the street, not hop.</i>

314
00:16:31,236 --> 00:16:32,843
Get out of the street!

315
00:16:36,966 --> 00:16:40,627
<i>She made me learn how frustrating it was
to pay full price for a pair of shoes</i>

316
00:16:40,747 --> 00:16:43,126
<i>when you knew
you were only gonna wear one.</i>

317
00:16:46,782 --> 00:16:48,241
<i>Didi made me realize</i>

318
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:50,462
<i>that even trying to relax was difficult.</i>

319
00:16:59,317 --> 00:17:00,105
Go back.

320
00:17:08,018 --> 00:17:10,541
<i>Didi must have realized
I was getting the message,</i>

321
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:13,939
<i>'cause she let me share the half
of her foot bath that she never used.</i>

322
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:20,168
I am so sorry.

323
00:17:20,929 --> 00:17:22,129
I forgive you.

324
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,179
You can cross me off your list.

325
00:17:29,479 --> 00:17:32,562
<i>My foot hurt so bad,
I had to use the other one to get home.</i>

326
00:17:32,682 --> 00:17:34,790
<i>I still didn't understand
how suffering for Didi</i>

327
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:37,650
<i>was Karma's answer
to me suffering with my wife.</i>

328
00:17:38,136 --> 00:17:39,773
<i>Then came the weirdest thing yet.</i>

329
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,106
Earl, I'm sorry I've been
a little stingy with you.

330
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,731
It's our money.

331
00:17:44,323 --> 00:17:45,576
Here's an ATM card,

332
00:17:45,696 --> 00:17:47,869
so you don't have to ask me for it
anymore.

333
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:50,906
Oh, there's a special card
you have to put in.

334
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:52,907
And...

335
00:17:53,293 --> 00:17:55,244
I got you your own box of tissues.

336
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,657
You should be able to decide
how many you need.

337
00:17:58,915 --> 00:18:00,332
Well, thanks.

338
00:18:01,422 --> 00:18:02,759
I'll be right back.

339
00:18:04,807 --> 00:18:05,963
I don't get it.

340
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:09,258
She was terrible and now she's nice.
What's Karma trying to tell me?

341
00:18:09,566 --> 00:18:11,427
It's so obvious, Earl.

342
00:18:11,547 --> 00:18:14,054
If you pick up a trailer
for one lady you pissed off

343
00:18:14,214 --> 00:18:16,485
and you hop around
for another lady you pissed off,

344
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:19,158
then your annoying wife
will give you a box of tissues.

345
00:18:19,278 --> 00:18:21,145
I think the ATM card is just random.

346
00:18:21,614 --> 00:18:23,558
You bring up a good point, Randy.

347
00:18:24,227 --> 00:18:26,368
I've pissed off a lot of ladies.

348
00:18:26,716 --> 00:18:28,509
But when I made it up to two of them,

349
00:18:28,629 --> 00:18:30,362
the lady pissing me off got nicer.

350
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:33,889
I think you're just restating
my tissue example.

351
00:18:34,251 --> 00:18:36,545
Maybe that's what Karma's been saying.

352
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:39,100
Maybe if I make up
to the women I've hurt,

353
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,345
my marriage will start to work.

354
00:18:41,465 --> 00:18:43,534
I just wish there was a way
I could double-check.

355
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:46,925
Perfect. Come here.

356
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,928
When I saw you at Club Chubby
on Christmas, I was a pig, right?

357
00:18:51,192 --> 00:18:52,926
And I slapped your butt cheek.

358
00:18:53,141 --> 00:18:54,769
Yeah, hard enough to leave a mark.

359
00:18:54,889 --> 00:18:57,973
When Santa came, I couldn't even sit
on his lap, and he's a big tipper.

360
00:18:58,133 --> 00:19:00,309
Well, then, be mean back.
Make me suffer.

361
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,269
You can slap my ass or...

362
00:19:07,258 --> 00:19:08,185
Thank you.

363
00:19:08,305 --> 00:19:09,610
That was perfect.

364
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:11,019
I thought so.

365
00:19:13,941 --> 00:19:15,164
Check it out.

366
00:19:15,466 --> 00:19:18,327
They just added lemonade and
Chubby Cakes to the vending machine.

367
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:20,042
I know you like them.

368
00:19:20,162 --> 00:19:21,497
<i>And there it was,</i>

369
00:19:21,657 --> 00:19:23,157
<i>just like in my coma fantasy.</i>

370
00:19:23,277 --> 00:19:25,626
<i>I had a wife who brought me
cakes and lemonade.</i>

371
00:19:26,548 --> 00:19:28,837
And, Randy, something for you, too.

372
00:19:29,374 --> 00:19:30,969
What do I have to do?

373
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,062
Smile.

374
00:19:32,841 --> 00:19:35,677
<i>Then she did something
that really blew my mind.</i>

375
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,684
Did you hear that, Randy?

376
00:19:38,804 --> 00:19:41,403
She went to the bathroom
and shut the door.

377
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,033
It's all clear now.

378
00:19:45,556 --> 00:19:48,898
I've had bad marriages
because I've deserved bad marriages.

379
00:19:49,018 --> 00:19:50,442
I've been horrible to women.

380
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,408
But if I keep making it up to them,

381
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,366
things will keep getting better
with Billie and me.

382
00:19:58,065 --> 00:20:01,703
Randy, I need to make up for
the worst thing I've ever done to women.

383
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:03,831
N°204:

384
00:20:04,153 --> 00:20:05,999
"Seduced seven virgins."

385
00:20:06,574 --> 00:20:08,255
But, with the ATM card,

386
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,212
I mean, don't abuse it or anything.

387
00:20:10,372 --> 00:20:12,840
It's ours, but it's mainly mine.

388
00:20:13,917 --> 00:20:16,666
And, Randy, you're
still sleeping on the balcony.

389
00:20:16,786 --> 00:20:19,059
You need to get
to those virgins fast.

390
00:20:20,048 --> 00:20:23,341
<i>I'd been horrible to women in the past,
and now the only way Karma</i>

391
00:20:23,461 --> 00:20:25,299
<i>was gonna let me have a good
relationship</i>

392
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,670
<i>with my new wife, Billie,
was to make up for that.</i>

393
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,787
I can't wait for you
to fix this thing with Billie

394
00:20:29,907 --> 00:20:31,902
so I can stop sleeping
on the balcony,

395
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,842
although, lately when I wake up
facing the railing,

396
00:20:34,962 --> 00:20:36,758
I feel like I'm in a giant crib,

397
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:37,990
which is nice.

398
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,325
<i>If I was gonna get Randy
off the balcony,</i>

399
00:20:40,445 --> 00:20:43,540
<i>I needed to make up for the worst thing
I'd ever done to women.</i>

400
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:46,468
<i>N°204: "Seduced seven virgins."</i>

401
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:50,965
<i>Way back when, a group of Amish
settled near Camden.</i>

402
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:54,882
<i>Everything was fine, until they started
adopting modern technology.</i>

403
00:20:55,371 --> 00:20:56,763
Behold...

404
00:20:56,883 --> 00:20:58,093
the wheel!

405
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:00,346
That is the devil's work!

406
00:21:00,466 --> 00:21:03,102
It has no beginning and no end.

407
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,198
We shall have none of it.

408
00:21:05,318 --> 00:21:08,288
<i>And so, unwilling to change
their deep-seated beliefs,</i>

409
00:21:08,472 --> 00:21:09,608
<i>half the group left</i>

410
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:12,190
<i>and called themselves
the Camdenites.</i>

411
00:21:12,674 --> 00:21:14,440
<i>As the world grew up around them,</i>

412
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,681
<i>the Camdenites decided that
when each young girl turned 21,</i>

413
00:21:17,801 --> 00:21:21,199
<i>they would go out to experience
regular society for 21 days.</i>

414
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:23,022
Those tempted

415
00:21:23,142 --> 00:21:25,815
by the evils of the outside world

416
00:21:26,624 --> 00:21:28,123
can choose to stay there,

417
00:21:28,596 --> 00:21:30,667
but those pure of heart

418
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:33,895
shall return to the glories
of a world with

419
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:38,008
no wheels, no medicine
and no advancements in knowledge

420
00:21:38,168 --> 00:21:39,843
of any kind whatsoever!

421
00:21:40,003 --> 00:21:42,179
Can thou giveth me a "hallelujah"?

422
00:21:42,616 --> 00:21:44,389
Hallelujah!

423
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,955
<i>I called it the Running
of the Virgins.</i>

424
00:21:55,075 --> 00:21:56,768
<i>Every year,
me and Randy were outside</i>

425
00:21:56,888 --> 00:21:59,708
<i>waiting for women
who had never heard a pick-up line.</i>

426
00:21:59,828 --> 00:22:01,401
Greetings, ladies.

427
00:22:01,521 --> 00:22:03,367
Is it hot out here,
or is it just you?

428
00:22:04,736 --> 00:22:06,546
Me and my brother
have been sent out

429
00:22:06,666 --> 00:22:09,331
from the Nathanite religious
settlement for 21 days.

430
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:10,576
Really?

431
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:13,543
We are just now also
on a journey into the world.

432
00:22:13,703 --> 00:22:15,064
That's crazy!

433
00:22:15,524 --> 00:22:17,423
How lucky are you to so quickly run

434
00:22:17,543 --> 00:22:19,847
into people you can
completely trust?

435
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:22,995
Come, let us explore
the world together.

436
00:22:24,705 --> 00:22:25,889
<i>Our goal was...</i>

437
00:22:26,009 --> 00:22:28,218
<i>I think our goal was
pretty obvious.</i>

438
00:22:29,308 --> 00:22:32,868
This barley soda's making me
feel warm under the bonnet.

439
00:22:33,601 --> 00:22:36,212
You know, that dancing thing
looks interesting.

440
00:22:36,332 --> 00:22:38,081
I'm afraid to try it alone.

441
00:22:38,201 --> 00:22:39,988
Do not be afraid, Earleth,

442
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,697
I shall do it with you.

443
00:22:42,581 --> 00:22:44,546
Okay, but we gotta stay real close

444
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,928
so the devil doesn't
get between us.

445
00:22:49,822 --> 00:22:51,635
If there's anything
you're afraid of,

446
00:22:51,755 --> 00:22:53,911
I'd be willing to
try it with you...

447
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,044
unless it's cauliflower.

448
00:22:58,182 --> 00:23:00,033
<i>I had a good thing going.</i>

449
00:23:01,056 --> 00:23:03,301
<i>And I did it year after year.</i>

450
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:06,013
<i>Some years,
the crops were plentiful.</i>

451
00:23:06,474 --> 00:23:08,580
<i>Other years, there was a drought.</i>

452
00:23:09,285 --> 00:23:11,812
<i>But a good farmer always finds
something to plow.</i>

453
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:14,510
<i>Yes, yes! Call me a Jezebel!</i>

454
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,954
<i>Jezebel!

455
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:21,340
<i>So I went back to Camdenite Village
and talked to their leader, Ruth,</i>

456
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,072
<i>to see how I could make up
to all those former virgins.</i>

457
00:23:24,232 --> 00:23:25,657
None of them are here.

458
00:23:25,817 --> 00:23:27,409
They never came back.

459
00:23:27,843 --> 00:23:30,495
They were alive when we left them,
if that's what you're hinting at.

460
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:31,798
No,

461
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:34,499
they all had such a great
time in the outside world,

462
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:36,168
they decided to stay.

463
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,589
If they're happy now, I guess it's not
the worst thing I ever did to women.

464
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:42,153
Maybe not to them,

465
00:23:42,273 --> 00:23:44,384
but it was to the rest of us.

466
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:46,534
You started a trend,

467
00:23:46,654 --> 00:23:50,193
and you know how kids are,
always swept up in the latest craze,

468
00:23:50,313 --> 00:23:53,631
like zippers or those wooden
figures on a stick

469
00:23:53,751 --> 00:23:55,235
that dance on your knee.

470
00:23:55,355 --> 00:23:57,763
None of our daughters
come back anymore.

471
00:23:58,185 --> 00:23:59,531
And without women,

472
00:23:59,651 --> 00:24:01,735
the Camdenites will soon be gone.

473
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,780
Maybe Karma wants me
to make something up to you.

474
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,947
I know!
We could buy you a pitchfork,

475
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:09,242
so you could shovel horse food
like a normal person.

476
00:24:09,402 --> 00:24:11,017
We don't use pitchforks.

477
00:24:11,137 --> 00:24:13,140
They are the tool of the devil.

478
00:24:14,895 --> 00:24:16,456
Although I tried one once,

479
00:24:16,576 --> 00:24:18,954
and it was about a thousand
times easier.

480
00:24:19,955 --> 00:24:22,047
There-there's gotta
be something I can do.

481
00:24:22,918 --> 00:24:24,360
My niece, Greta,

482
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,019
just turned 21,

483
00:24:26,139 --> 00:24:28,512
and in a few days,
will go out into the world.

484
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,400
If you want to help,

485
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,390
make sure she comes back.

486
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,891
And if she could bring back
the recipe for flour...

487
00:24:38,586 --> 00:24:40,941
We lost ours years ago.

488
00:24:41,101 --> 00:24:44,814
<i>Ruth was hoping that if Greta returned
after being in the outside world,</i>

489
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:47,243
<i>other Camdenite girls
would follow her example,</i>

490
00:24:47,363 --> 00:24:49,282
<i>and their community would be saved.</i>

491
00:24:49,442 --> 00:24:52,445
<i>To convince Greta that she wouldn't
want to live in the outside world,</i>

492
00:24:52,565 --> 00:24:55,870
<i>I showed her the scariest thing
I could think of: television.</i>

493
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:58,212
This is all so violent
and horrible.

494
00:24:58,801 --> 00:25:00,961
This is a show called
C.S.I.: Miami.

495
00:25:01,506 --> 00:25:04,260
That means "Crime Stuff in Miami."

496
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,300
That Creamsicle-looking guy,
his name's Horatio.

497
00:25:07,884 --> 00:25:09,469
Hello, cute hubby.

498
00:25:10,663 --> 00:25:13,149
I've got a special
surprise for you.

499
00:25:16,284 --> 00:25:17,519
Randy,

500
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,397
will you and your friend
give us a second?

501
00:25:20,599 --> 00:25:23,867
Sure. I'll show you my bedroom.
It's really big.

502
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:25,607
It's the entire outside.

503
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:28,167
Guess what I got.

504
00:25:28,754 --> 00:25:30,433
Flavored body gels.

505
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:33,994
Chocolate, strawberry and vanilla.

506
00:25:34,504 --> 00:25:36,089
<i>My plan seemed to be working.</i>

507
00:25:36,209 --> 00:25:38,206
<i>I was taking care
of my lady, Karma,</i>

508
00:25:38,366 --> 00:25:41,441
<i>so my lady was taking care of me.
All right.</i>

509
00:25:41,561 --> 00:25:43,381
I'm gonna go with the strawberry.

510
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:46,070
Smeared chocolate puts me
in the wrong frame of mind.

511
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,381
<i>Then, my mission to make Greta
dislike our world hit a bump.</i>

512
00:25:49,501 --> 00:25:51,112
That is most wondrous.

513
00:25:51,232 --> 00:25:54,302
On the farm, the only fun thing
we have to chew on is ox cartilage,

514
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:56,424
but the flavor is gone
after two seconds.

515
00:25:56,544 --> 00:25:58,399
<i>No sooner did Greta start
enjoying stuff</i>

516
00:25:58,519 --> 00:26:01,371
<i>from the modern world then Karma
made Billie change her tune.</i>

517
00:26:01,491 --> 00:26:02,753
Damn it, Earl!

518
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:06,610
Didn't I talk to you about letting
people sit on the made-up bed?

519
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,612
Well, aren't we
about to mess it up?

520
00:26:08,772 --> 00:26:12,020
You didn't know that
when you let people sit on it.

521
00:26:15,826 --> 00:26:17,370
I get it.

522
00:26:18,257 --> 00:26:19,919
I know what's going on.

523
00:26:20,039 --> 00:26:23,245
Karma's making you mad at me
'cause the girl out there is on my list

524
00:26:23,365 --> 00:26:25,021
and I need to be dealing with her.

525
00:26:25,141 --> 00:26:27,111
What the hell are
you talking about?

526
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:30,058
Great, she's chewing gum.
That's a gateway candy!

527
00:26:30,627 --> 00:26:31,927
Make her spit it out.

528
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:35,305
Honey, I really need
to get out there.

529
00:26:35,465 --> 00:26:38,428
- We're in the middle of something.
- I'm not trying to ignore you.

530
00:26:38,548 --> 00:26:42,275
If I don't make up to the women
I've hurt, you're gonna stay like this,

531
00:26:42,395 --> 00:26:44,231
and Karma's never
gonna make you my reward.

532
00:26:44,391 --> 00:26:47,868
Wait, so that's what I am to you,
some kind of carnival prize?

533
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:49,611
No, not right now, but...

534
00:26:51,496 --> 00:26:53,740
Come on, Randy, you're killing me!

535
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,750
Look, forget about the prize thing.
Can we talk about this later?

536
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:59,899
'Cause you'll be in a much better mood
once I get Greta off my list.

537
00:27:00,019 --> 00:27:00,997
No list!

538
00:27:01,157 --> 00:27:03,877
You need to decide
what's more important.

539
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:06,592
Me... or that damn list.

540
00:27:07,182 --> 00:27:08,587
Yeah,

541
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:09,868
here's the thing.

542
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,753
If I pick you,

543
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:14,144
Karma's never
gonna let us get along,

544
00:27:14,264 --> 00:27:16,039
but if I pick the list,

545
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,369
you're gonna go
even more psycho on me,

546
00:27:18,489 --> 00:27:20,765
but Karma can fix that. So...

547
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:23,997
I'm gonna go with the list.

548
00:27:29,194 --> 00:27:30,369
Wrong answer.

549
00:27:30,895 --> 00:27:33,154
<i>If I wanted Karma
to make Billie nice again,</i>

550
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:36,363
<i>I need to convince Greta
the outside world was evil.</i>

551
00:27:36,483 --> 00:27:38,756
And that is when I said,
"Excuse me, sir,

552
00:27:38,876 --> 00:27:40,412
"but that is not a bottle opener."

553
00:27:40,851 --> 00:27:42,909
So, you dance for men?

554
00:27:43,999 --> 00:27:47,522
- Just for money?
- I dance, I jump, I grind.

555
00:27:47,642 --> 00:27:50,338
I once hung upside down
and let a man throw bologna at me.

556
00:27:53,697 --> 00:27:54,531
Hello?

557
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:58,596
Hey, Earl,
Joy would like a word with you,

558
00:27:58,756 --> 00:28:01,830
and based on her tone,
I think it's gonna be a curse word.

559
00:28:02,257 --> 00:28:04,390
<i>Earl, you son of a bitch!
You better get your...</i>

560
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,021
That's a phone. Isn't it cool?

561
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:07,647
How does it work?

562
00:28:07,807 --> 00:28:09,482
Nobody knows.

563
00:28:09,642 --> 00:28:12,694
<i>I didn't believe what Joy told me
until I saw it with my own eyes.</i>

564
00:28:12,854 --> 00:28:14,763
Your wife tied a rope to your car

565
00:28:14,883 --> 00:28:17,613
- and flipped my trailer back over.
- I don't get it, if Billie's mad at me,

566
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:20,188
- why would she take it out on you?
- Where is she?

567
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:23,455
I am so angry, I just want to beat her
with my tiny little fists.

568
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:25,345
That's right, let it out, Cricket.

569
00:28:25,465 --> 00:28:27,908
You're never gonna believe
what Billie did.

570
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:31,379
It's not often we get to meet
one of Kenny's girlfriends.

571
00:28:31,539 --> 00:28:33,673
You are Kenny's girlfriend,
aren't you?

572
00:28:34,426 --> 00:28:36,452
I'm not sure I'm Kenny's type.

573
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,345
Here, see for yourself.

574
00:28:41,883 --> 00:28:44,434
Please tell me he's blowing up
a man-shaped balloon.

575
00:28:44,892 --> 00:28:48,646
Earl, she told my parents
she is going to undo your entire list.

576
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:51,920
The list.

577
00:28:52,709 --> 00:28:54,110
Billie must've stolen it.

578
00:28:54,698 --> 00:28:57,412
Looks like there's a monster
loose in Camden.

579
00:28:58,779 --> 00:29:00,079
Then I guess...

580
00:29:00,988 --> 00:29:02,976
we're going monster hunting.

581
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:09,390
Sorry.

582
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:10,991
I stepped on a nail.

583
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:16,677
<i>Once we figured out</i>

584
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:19,116
<i>that Billie was trying to undo
everything on my list,</i>

585
00:29:19,236 --> 00:29:21,846
<i>Darnell helped us set up what
he called a command center.</i>

586
00:29:22,363 --> 00:29:24,700
I put pins in the locations
where she's already struck.

587
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,999
It'll help us figure out
where she's gonna hit.

588
00:29:27,119 --> 00:29:28,542
According to my calculations,

589
00:29:28,662 --> 00:29:31,414
the only place I know for sure
is safe is Pop's Hot Dog Cart.

590
00:29:31,534 --> 00:29:33,857
Billie just burned down
Pop's Hot Dog Cart.

591
00:29:34,749 --> 00:29:37,487
All right, I was guessing,
but damn, what are the odds?

592
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,431
Greta,

593
00:29:42,551 --> 00:29:44,452
she just wrote that in ink, right?

594
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,185
Watch this.

595
00:29:48,696 --> 00:29:50,625
- Are you magic?
- Yes.

596
00:29:51,274 --> 00:29:52,093
No,

597
00:29:52,704 --> 00:29:54,921
it's a dry erase marker,
and they're evil,

598
00:29:55,081 --> 00:29:57,700
- you can get high from sniffing them.
- I'll show you.

599
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,356
Randy, put it down.

600
00:30:00,654 --> 00:30:01,682
Hey, Earl,

601
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:05,393
thanks to your wife, our neighborhood
is crawling with tourists.

602
00:30:05,513 --> 00:30:07,350
Everybody wants to see "freak town."

603
00:30:07,827 --> 00:30:09,940
Some guy tried to put me
in a Baby Bjorn.

604
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,626
I hate Austin Powers.

605
00:30:13,435 --> 00:30:16,411
<i>Hey, look, there's a couple
of freaks right now!</i>

606
00:30:17,102 --> 00:30:19,214
<i>It's Horn Head and Tiny Guy.</i>

607
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:20,834
<i>Feel free to point and laugh,</i>

608
00:30:20,954 --> 00:30:23,116
<i>as they do not have emotions
like you and I.</i>

609
00:30:26,846 --> 00:30:29,750
<i>We were trying hard to figure out
who else she was gonna hit.</i>

610
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:33,251
<i>Turns out, the real question was,
who wasn't she gonna hit?</i>

611
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:34,586
<i>She got Didi.</i>

612
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:41,134
<i>She got Mistletoe the Stripper,</i>

613
00:30:41,294 --> 00:30:44,888
<i>first day back to work at Club Chubby
without her back brace.</i>

614
00:30:53,603 --> 00:30:55,874
<i>She even made a recording
of Nescobar-A-Lop-Lop,</i>

615
00:30:55,994 --> 00:30:57,596
<i>so he could hear his own accent.</i>

616
00:30:57,716 --> 00:30:59,878
Oh, God, that's what I sound like?

617
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:02,363
People should make fun of foreigners.

618
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:06,128
<i>And before I knew it,</i>

619
00:31:06,248 --> 00:31:09,229
<i>it seemed like I had
the whole town in front of me.</i>

620
00:31:13,537 --> 00:31:14,709
People, people!

621
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:16,628
I'll fix it all.

622
00:31:17,324 --> 00:31:18,421
I'm doing my best.

623
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:23,384
It's Billie.

624
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,436
You got to stop this, Billie.

625
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:31,559
<i>You like spending time
with your list so much,</i>

626
00:31:31,719 --> 00:31:33,770
<i>now you get
to start all over again.</i>

627
00:31:34,621 --> 00:31:36,875
It's not right.
You're hurting innocent people.

628
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:38,233
<i>Speaking of innocent,</i>

629
00:31:38,713 --> 00:31:40,672
someone wants to talk to you.

630
00:31:41,562 --> 00:31:44,531
We went shopping, Earl,
and now we're having fast food.

631
00:31:45,491 --> 00:31:47,534
<i>I just ate beef
that I didn't have to raise,</i>

632
00:31:47,694 --> 00:31:49,003
name and look in the eyes

633
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:51,101
as I smashed its head
with a killing hammer.

634
00:31:51,221 --> 00:31:52,413
<i>It's delicious!</i>

635
00:31:52,707 --> 00:31:55,380
- Randy, I told you to watch Greta.
- I did.

636
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,585
I watched her go out
and to the vending machine.

637
00:31:57,745 --> 00:31:59,796
She's so cute,
I can't take my eyes off her.

638
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:04,684
Oh, you meant watch,
like keep track of her.

639
00:32:04,804 --> 00:32:06,261
That, I did not do.

640
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:08,687
Billie, I swear,
if anything happens to that girl...

641
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:10,515
<i>It'll be your fault, Earl.</i>

642
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:13,182
You made me do this
when you chose your list over me,

643
00:32:13,302 --> 00:32:14,852
so if you keep doing your list,

644
00:32:14,993 --> 00:32:16,729
I'll keep making bad things happen

645
00:32:16,889 --> 00:32:18,173
to people on it.

646
00:32:18,391 --> 00:32:20,678
Oh, my God, she's talking about us!

647
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:37,125
<i>That's when I realized,
there was only one thing left to do.</i>

648
00:32:37,493 --> 00:32:40,003
<i>So, for the last time, Earl,
what's it gonna be...</i>

649
00:32:40,387 --> 00:32:41,736
<i>me or the list?</i>

650
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,124
Okay, Billie, I choose you.

651
00:32:49,512 --> 00:32:51,712
<i>I couldn't believe
I had to give up my list,</i>

652
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:54,225
<i>but I hoped if I could get
Greta back to the Camdenites,</i>

653
00:32:54,702 --> 00:32:56,863
<i>Karma would make everything okay.</i>

654
00:33:02,322 --> 00:33:05,278
Glad you finally manned up
and did right by your wife, Earl.

655
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:08,837
- Where's Greta?
- I left her at Chubby's Burgers.

656
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:11,766
What do you care?
You're here for me, not her, right?

657
00:33:11,886 --> 00:33:14,649
You're not even giving us a chance.
You didn't even bring her.

658
00:33:14,769 --> 00:33:16,748
How do you expect Karma
to do anything for us?

659
00:33:16,908 --> 00:33:19,417
- Screw Karma.
- You shouldn't have said that.

660
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:21,941
Why? What's gonna happen to me?

661
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,716
- You called the cops?
- I didn't, I swear.

662
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:28,259
Then who did? Karma?

663
00:33:28,419 --> 00:33:31,094
<i>It wasn't Karma.
It was something much scarier than that.</i>

664
00:33:31,214 --> 00:33:33,574
There's the trailer-flipping whore.
There she is.

665
00:33:33,694 --> 00:33:35,183
She's making a run for it.

666
00:33:35,343 --> 00:33:36,973
Tase the bitch! Tase her!

667
00:33:37,093 --> 00:33:37,977
Hey, Earl.

668
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,535
Hey, Crab Man.

669
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:40,730
I trusted you.

670
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,331
You said you were putting me first.

671
00:33:43,451 --> 00:33:45,883
Well, now,
I'm putting you first on my list...

672
00:33:46,003 --> 00:33:47,195
of people to kill.

673
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:48,578
That's a death threat.

674
00:33:48,698 --> 00:33:50,757
I know that you can arrest her
just for saying that

675
00:33:50,877 --> 00:33:52,602
and keep her without pressing charges

676
00:33:52,722 --> 00:33:54,124
or letting her call her kids.

677
00:33:54,244 --> 00:33:56,579
I can't. She just stepped
on Camdenite property.

678
00:33:56,739 --> 00:33:59,832
It's a sovereign land.
Camden Police have no jurisdiction.

679
00:33:59,992 --> 00:34:01,517
We try to keep that under wraps.

680
00:34:01,637 --> 00:34:03,848
Otherwise, all the criminals
would hide out there.

681
00:34:03,968 --> 00:34:05,922
Good. Then I'll just hide out here.

682
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:07,310
See?

683
00:34:09,657 --> 00:34:11,094
When you least expect it...

684
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:15,194
... I'll be coming for you, Earl.

685
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,507
Don't worry, buddy.
I'm gonna be out here 24/7

686
00:34:18,627 --> 00:34:20,578
to nab her as soon as she leaves.

687
00:34:20,698 --> 00:34:21,973
Actually, 24/5.

688
00:34:22,261 --> 00:34:24,393
In 5 days,
it's the department bass fishing trip,

689
00:34:24,513 --> 00:34:25,886
which is gonna be a blast,

690
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:28,027
but it'll leave us
a little shorthanded.

691
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:32,132
<i>I had 5 days to find Greta and convince
her to return to the Camdenites,</i>

692
00:34:32,252 --> 00:34:33,939
<i>so Karma would be happy.</i>

693
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:40,216
<i>Now, it wasn't just
to save my relationship.</i>

694
00:34:40,336 --> 00:34:42,000
<i>It was to save my life.</i>

695
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,253
Here, Greta!

696
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,136
<i>But she was nowhere to be found.</i>

697
00:34:53,256 --> 00:34:55,881
<i>And after searching
around the clock for five days,</i>

698
00:34:56,001 --> 00:34:57,569
<i>I knew I was screwed.</i>

699
00:34:59,995 --> 00:35:00,961
Good luck!

700
00:35:04,487 --> 00:35:07,775
<i>I was out of time. Billie could
be coming for me any minute, and</i>

701
00:35:07,935 --> 00:35:10,197
<i>I still didn't know where Greta was.</i>

702
00:35:10,317 --> 00:35:12,698
Turns ordinary water
into champagne.

703
00:35:14,066 --> 00:35:15,450
Greta, where have you been?

704
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:17,994
Randy's been hiding me.

705
00:35:18,154 --> 00:35:20,329
Damn it, Randy, you know
my situation with Billie.

706
00:35:20,947 --> 00:35:24,109
If Greta doesn't go back,
I can't fix my Karma with women.

707
00:35:24,606 --> 00:35:27,873
What about me?
Everything's always about your list.

708
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:29,452
When I do I get a turn?

709
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:31,272
I don't have bad Karma with women,

710
00:35:31,392 --> 00:35:34,302
so why should I have to lose Greta
to help your problem with Billie?

711
00:35:35,129 --> 00:35:37,987
Besides, I want to stay out here
in the land of zippers

712
00:35:38,107 --> 00:35:40,600
and mirrors and tampons
that are not made out of hay.

713
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,589
You can't decide
to change your whole way of life

714
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,275
just based on a few days.

715
00:35:46,474 --> 00:35:49,901
You changed your life in just one day,
and that was right for you.

716
00:35:52,646 --> 00:35:54,280
I said something smart, didn't I?

717
00:35:54,669 --> 00:35:57,200
Oh, you always say
something smart, Randy.

718
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,369
<i>Maybe Greta wasn't supposed
to help me fix my Karma with women.</i>

719
00:36:00,529 --> 00:36:04,207
<i>Maybe she was part of Randy's Karma,
rewarding him for being a good guy.</i>

720
00:36:08,524 --> 00:36:10,818
<i>And that meant I needed
to come up with something else</i>

721
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:14,596
<i>to make things up to the Camdenites.
But it was hard to think about that</i>

722
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:17,058
<i>when I was worried about Billie
being on the loose.</i>

723
00:36:17,178 --> 00:36:19,847
<i>And I knew I had to stay awake
and keep an eye out.</i>

724
00:37:01,981 --> 00:37:03,148
Wakey, wakey.

725
00:37:03,438 --> 00:37:04,826
Life's at stakey!

726
00:37:04,946 --> 00:37:07,070
<i>This time, I knew
I wasn't dreaming,</i>

727
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:09,189
<i>and Billie still had her key.</i>

728
00:37:13,537 --> 00:37:15,570
Quick! Just pretend we're pillows.

729
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:17,318
It's okay.

730
00:37:18,258 --> 00:37:19,657
I'm not here to hurt you.

731
00:37:20,255 --> 00:37:21,868
Then what's with the ax?

732
00:37:23,193 --> 00:37:26,594
All Camdenite women carry them
for protection when we leave the farm.

733
00:37:26,942 --> 00:37:28,887
I suggested pepper spray,
but it turns out,

734
00:37:29,007 --> 00:37:31,961
we Camdenites don't believe
in spray... or pepper.

735
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,194
"We Camdenites?"

736
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,895
<i>It seemed the Camdenites
didn't have a problem</i>

737
00:37:37,015 --> 00:37:39,791
<i>with Billie using their land
to hide out from the police.</i>

738
00:37:45,134 --> 00:37:46,855
<i>But they've a problem sharing their land</i>

739
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:49,077
<i>with someone not willing
to share the work.</i>

740
00:37:58,489 --> 00:38:00,382
<i>And while it took some getting used to,</i>

741
00:38:00,502 --> 00:38:04,066
<i>she soon found that field work was
a great way to get out her anger.</i>

742
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:06,655
<i>In fact,
it made her feel pretty good.</i>

743
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:19,226
<i>And, when she fell back
into her stealing ways,</i>

744
00:38:19,346 --> 00:38:21,552
<i>it didn't work, 'cause
in the Camdenite village,</i>

745
00:38:21,712 --> 00:38:23,234
<i>all the property was shared.</i>

746
00:38:23,354 --> 00:38:24,680
You can have it.

747
00:38:32,117 --> 00:38:34,572
<i>And even though
she was used to being selfish,</i>

748
00:38:34,692 --> 00:38:37,877
<i>it was hard to be greedy around people
who were so happy to give.</i>

749
00:38:52,254 --> 00:38:55,009
<i>Billie had spent her whole life
searching for something.</i>

750
00:38:55,129 --> 00:38:57,446
<i>She tried crime, nursing school,</i>

751
00:38:57,566 --> 00:38:59,695
<i>and then she met me,
and tried Karma.</i>

752
00:38:59,815 --> 00:39:02,301
<i>But nothing felt right...
until now.</i>

753
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:13,437
I guess Karma didn't want to turn you
into another me, after all.

754
00:39:13,972 --> 00:39:16,148
I was just supposed
to help you find the real you.

755
00:39:17,116 --> 00:39:19,568
And now you could cross
the Camdenites off your list.

756
00:39:21,131 --> 00:39:22,184
But first...

757
00:39:24,626 --> 00:39:26,123
... divorce papers.

758
00:39:27,504 --> 00:39:29,412
Uh, you need to sign...

759
00:39:29,936 --> 00:39:31,503
I know where to sign.

760
00:39:41,945 --> 00:39:43,154
Thanks, Earl.

761
00:39:45,951 --> 00:39:47,054
What's this?

762
00:39:48,506 --> 00:39:51,287
Maybe Karma didn't want me
to be your reward,

763
00:39:51,581 --> 00:39:53,269
but it still wanted you to have one.

764
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:00,303
Do good things.

765
00:40:14,558 --> 00:40:17,460
<i>"Dear Mr. Rockefeller, this $72,000</i>

766
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,454
<i>"is the remainder
of my insurance settlement.</i>

767
00:40:20,728 --> 00:40:24,116
<i>"It would be more if you didn't
double up on the tissues.</i>

768
00:40:24,479 --> 00:40:27,128
<i>"I think this money was always
meant for you.</i>

769
00:40:27,248 --> 00:40:28,538
<i>"Love, Billie."</i>

770
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:42,818
<i>I was glad Billie found
where she belonged.</i>

771
00:40:43,372 --> 00:40:45,687
<i>After I had spent time in prison...</i>

772
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,366
<i>after I doubted Karma
and got hit by a car...</i>

773
00:40:50,347 --> 00:40:52,995
<i>after lying for a pretty
good while in a coma...</i>

774
00:40:56,063 --> 00:40:57,779
<i>... I had my list again,</i>

775
00:40:58,234 --> 00:41:00,846
<i>and I was finally back
where I belonged.</i>
