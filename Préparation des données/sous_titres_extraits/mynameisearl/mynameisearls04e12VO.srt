1
00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:03,293
READING IS A FUNDAMENTAL CASE

2
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,018
I think there's something wrong
with these books.

3
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:22,853
The Camden Library couldn't afford
actual classics so...

4
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:24,365
they bought knockoffs.

5
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:26,900
That explains
<i>The Adventures of Chuckleberry Flinn</i>.

6
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,800
I'm going to read
<i>Trazan the Ape Man</i>.

7
00:00:29,925 --> 00:00:31,696
He's got a pet cheetah named Monkey.

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:34,908
All right, let's get started.

9
00:00:36,109 --> 00:00:37,895
<i>Trazan the Ape Man</i>.

10
00:00:39,556 --> 00:00:43,487
"You may be shocked as I describe
this strange and unusual tale

11
00:00:43,612 --> 00:00:45,966
"but I assure you
that every word is true."

12
00:00:46,091 --> 00:00:48,270
<i>And you may be shocked
I'm reading to kids</i>

13
00:00:48,395 --> 00:00:51,474
<i>but like all good adventures,
it starts at the beginning.</i>

14
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:52,950
<i>Back before my list,</i>

15
00:00:53,075 --> 00:00:55,125
<i>me and Randy got sentenced
to community service</i>

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:57,705
<i>in the "Humiliate
to Rehabilitate program."</i>

17
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,682
Hi, Dad.

18
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:06,486
How big's a body part got to be
before we're supposed to report it?

19
00:01:06,611 --> 00:01:07,909
Fist or larger.

20
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:09,615
Never mind then.

21
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,838
<i>It was crappy work
but one guy made it kind of fun.</i>

22
00:01:18,736 --> 00:01:20,246
That guy's doing the theme song

23
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,455
from that show that comes on
every couple of years

24
00:01:22,625 --> 00:01:24,708
about the different colored people
with superpowers

25
00:01:24,878 --> 00:01:27,551
like swimming fast
or throwing sticks real far.

26
00:01:28,332 --> 00:01:30,171
I saw an episode of that once.

27
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:33,421
Come on, fellas,
they're only going to burn it later on.

28
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:36,344
Why should those bastards
in the dump have all the fun?

29
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,940
Those guys at the dump
do have all the fun.

30
00:01:39,065 --> 00:01:40,554
Give me that lighter.

31
00:01:42,892 --> 00:01:45,006
This is a huge misunderstanding.

32
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:47,092
<i>Raynard was so cool</i>

33
00:01:47,217 --> 00:01:50,233
<i>he let us crash with him when our dad
threw us out for the eighth time.</i>

34
00:01:50,403 --> 00:01:51,525
Come on in!

35
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:58,858
There's a bathtub
in the living room.

36
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:01,661
And he's got outside plants
growing on the inside.

37
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:04,414
I didn't grow them on the inside,
I just

38
00:02:04,584 --> 00:02:07,292
opened up the window
and gave the plants a choice.

39
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:09,878
And did you open the bathroom door

40
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,422
and give the tub a choice
or are you just crazy?

41
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:14,048
I'll tell you what is crazy,

42
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:16,894
is letting somebody tell you
where you can put your tub.

43
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:20,638
Believe me, the news isn't so depressing
when you're surrounded by bubbles.

44
00:02:23,026 --> 00:02:25,185
I think your globe is upside down.

45
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:26,303
It's not.

46
00:02:26,428 --> 00:02:27,967
No, I'm pretty sure it is.

47
00:02:28,092 --> 00:02:30,565
Geography was the only class
I went to in high school.

48
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:33,568
Teacher was hot,
had a touch of the palsy.

49
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:35,987
She was always dropping stuff.

50
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:39,467
Bending over to pick it up...

51
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,683
Dropping it again...

52
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,290
Anyway,
the North Pole should be on top.

53
00:02:48,161 --> 00:02:50,835
There is no up or down
in space, man.

54
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:52,247
Look at my hand.

55
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:55,443
A spaceship is coming at the Earth
like this, okay?

56
00:02:57,693 --> 00:02:59,016
This is the top.

57
00:02:59,603 --> 00:03:01,433
But if you come at it like this...

58
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,601
the top becomes the bottom.

59
00:03:10,682 --> 00:03:11,950
Makes you think.

60
00:03:14,507 --> 00:03:16,416
A globe is the Earth?

61
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:22,448
<i>Oh, Susannah, don't you cry for me</i>

62
00:03:22,987 --> 00:03:28,769
<i>I come from Alabama
with a guitar on my knee</i>

63
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:31,438
<i>As fun as Raynard was,</i>

64
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:33,762
<i>he was a little nervous
around the ladies.</i>

65
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:37,864
Nice...

66
00:03:44,248 --> 00:03:45,640
Let me handle this.

67
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,028
We're in a band.

68
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:48,852
We're opening for U2.

69
00:03:49,022 --> 00:03:51,038
- U2?
- Yeah, me, too.

70
00:03:51,662 --> 00:03:52,689
All of us.

71
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:55,072
That's right, so,
who wants to party with guys

72
00:03:55,197 --> 00:03:57,694
that are going to be sharing
a shower with Bono?

73
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:59,380
Sweet!

74
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:02,629
Do you have a tour bus?
'Cause we don't party with garage bands.

75
00:04:03,134 --> 00:04:05,208
No, but we take the bus.

76
00:04:05,771 --> 00:04:07,370
He's kidding. Yeah, we got one.

77
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,038
A big shiny one.

78
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:10,895
It's like 100 feet long!

79
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,714
Everybody stop talking.

80
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,046
Meet me outside in ten minutes.

81
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,747
<i>I went out and stole
the first bus-like thing I could find.</i>

82
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:23,901
<i>We wanted to party
where we wouldn't be disturbed,</i>

83
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:26,981
<i>so we drove out
to the old abandoned Camden Scout Camp.</i>

84
00:04:27,106 --> 00:04:28,923
<i>The next morning,
we got the girls to leave</i>

85
00:04:29,048 --> 00:04:31,936
<i>by telling them we had to rehearse
and that we'd call them later.</i>

86
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,105
<i>Neither one of those things
were true.</i>

87
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,753
<i>And we didn't want to get caught
driving a stolen Bookmobile,</i>

88
00:04:36,878 --> 00:04:37,976
<i>so, we walked, too.</i>

89
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:40,778
That girl bit me.
Is that hot or scary?

90
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:45,716
<i>And that's where our tour bus stayed</i>

91
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:48,465
<i>until me and Randy
went out to do #219:</i>

92
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,184
<i>"Stole a Bookmobile."</i>

93
00:04:52,365 --> 00:04:54,567
But I don't understand
why I can't have one.

94
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:56,519
I promise I'll feed it and walk it

95
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:58,564
and if it's bad
I'll hit it with a shovel.

96
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:01,487
I'm not sure
you're ready for a puppy, Randy.

97
00:05:01,872 --> 00:05:03,217
Let's see if she'll start.

98
00:05:04,764 --> 00:05:05,929
What the hell?!

99
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:16,241
"No one who saw him
could say for certain

100
00:05:16,366 --> 00:05:17,857
"if he was an ape or a man.

101
00:05:18,546 --> 00:05:20,735
"Perhaps he was
neither one of those things.

102
00:05:21,471 --> 00:05:23,844
"Perhaps, he was both."

103
00:05:27,788 --> 00:05:29,987
"Even though
we were paralyzed with fear,

104
00:05:30,112 --> 00:05:33,755
"we couldn't help but gaze
with wonder at this most odd creature

105
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,734
"that looked so much like a man

106
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,683
"but acted so much like a beast."

107
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:43,595
What are we going to do?

108
00:05:44,372 --> 00:05:46,685
Raynard always told us
to think for ourselves.

109
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,909
We should set this thing
on fire and run.

110
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:50,753
We can't leave leave him, Randy.

111
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,419
I got a feeling
this might be all my fault.

112
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:55,308
<i>Turns out, it was all my fault.</i>

113
00:05:55,433 --> 00:05:58,486
<i>The last time I saw Raynard was
right after me and Joy got married.</i>

114
00:05:58,611 --> 00:05:59,754
Earl! Buddy!

115
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,602
Great to see you, Raynard.

116
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:04,675
But we got to keep it down.

117
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:06,280
I got a wife now,

118
00:06:06,738 --> 00:06:07,615
pregnant...

119
00:06:08,203 --> 00:06:09,313
hormones...

120
00:06:09,518 --> 00:06:10,747
a little touchy.

121
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:12,305
Super hearing.

122
00:06:12,656 --> 00:06:14,414
What's
with all this chitter chatter?

123
00:06:14,584 --> 00:06:15,707
Hey, sugar.

124
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:17,719
- It's my friend, Raynard.
- Who cares?

125
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:21,379
I'm working my ass off to grow this baby
and you're out here having a party!

126
00:06:21,712 --> 00:06:22,964
I need peace and quiet.

127
00:06:23,857 --> 00:06:27,021
I mean, what if I'm doing something
really important on the baby today?

128
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:28,803
Like his brain or his weiner?

129
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:31,789
You even care?

130
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,918
I need a glass of Chablis!

131
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,523
She seems nice.

132
00:06:41,782 --> 00:06:43,116
So Earl, buddy,

133
00:06:43,241 --> 00:06:46,368
I was wondering if I could crash
with you guys for a while.

134
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:47,613
I got evicted.

135
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:51,367
Cheers!

136
00:06:51,537 --> 00:06:53,161
Stop talking funny!

137
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,069
You can see
what I'm up against here.

138
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:57,331
Joy's not going to like it
if I let you stay.

139
00:06:57,704 --> 00:06:58,535
But...

140
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:01,544
I've tried everywhere.
I've got nowhere else to go.

141
00:07:15,773 --> 00:07:17,143
Earl! My water broke!

142
00:07:18,948 --> 00:07:21,360
Never mind, never mind,
I just peed the bed.

143
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:22,857
Come clean it up.

144
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,395
<i>After that night,</i>

145
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,661
<i>Raynard wandered
broke and homeless for days</i>

146
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:30,668
<i>until he stumbled across what was left
of Camden's library outreach program</i>

147
00:07:31,424 --> 00:07:33,751
<i>and that reminded him
of the Bookmobile.</i>

148
00:07:37,962 --> 00:07:40,118
I got to put him on the list, Randy.

149
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:42,428
When we were in trouble
he let us crash at his place

150
00:07:42,553 --> 00:07:44,412
but when he need somewhere to stay,

151
00:07:44,537 --> 00:07:46,689
- I didn't help him.
- But that's Joy's fault.

152
00:07:46,814 --> 00:07:48,951
She was so mean
when she was pregnant...

153
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:50,612
and when she wasn't.

154
00:07:50,858 --> 00:07:53,975
We could've tried harder.
We should've been there for him.

155
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:58,851
Raynard, don't be scared.

156
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,896
It's Earl and Randy Hickey.
You remember us?

157
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:05,274
We stole this Bookmobile with you.

158
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:08,062
We're your friends.

159
00:08:18,223 --> 00:08:19,025
You!

160
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,045
Friend!

161
00:08:21,966 --> 00:08:23,270
What's the matter, buddy?

162
00:08:23,395 --> 00:08:26,670
You been living in the woods so long
you forgot how to speak?

163
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:30,007
No one speak to

164
00:08:30,409 --> 00:08:31,331
me.

165
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:34,220
Cool.
He figured out a way to talk out

166
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,040
here using less words.

167
00:08:36,684 --> 00:08:38,067
What a time-saver.

168
00:08:38,942 --> 00:08:40,347
Me like you talk.

169
00:08:40,813 --> 00:08:42,747
Me like you talk, too.

170
00:08:44,832 --> 00:08:47,316
- Smell Raynard?
- No, thank. Just like talk part.

171
00:08:48,536 --> 00:08:50,278
So, what are you doing out here?

172
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:51,904
You okay?

173
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:53,827
Yeah, happy.

174
00:08:54,143 --> 00:08:56,407
It paradise.

175
00:08:57,656 --> 00:08:59,083
Yeah, it's beautiful.

176
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:01,330
But where do you find
food and stuff?

177
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:03,273
Food?

178
00:09:03,398 --> 00:09:04,803
Food. You hungry.

179
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:06,208
I be back.

180
00:09:08,504 --> 00:09:09,499
Weird.

181
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:12,460
I think he's gone crazy.

182
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:14,971
I don't know, Earl. He seems happy.

183
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,016
Plus, he's got a pretty sweet setup.

184
00:09:17,141 --> 00:09:19,624
Maybe we're the crazy ones
for not living like this.

185
00:09:19,749 --> 00:09:23,107
Friend!
This is my hot wife, Sharlene.

186
00:09:25,587 --> 00:09:27,428
Nope, he's the crazy one.

187
00:09:27,735 --> 00:09:28,552
Food.

188
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:30,856
Hot wife!

189
00:09:31,715 --> 00:09:32,820
Perfect life!

190
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,061
<i>And then I realized
why he was crazy.</i>

191
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:37,200
<i>Me and Randy had seen
those berries before.</i>

192
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,866
<i>Back when I was married to Joy</i>

193
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:40,870
<i>and the bill collectors
got to be too much,</i>

194
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,454
- <i>sometimes we'd go camping.</i>
- Ya'll be honest,

195
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:45,374
is the bottom half of me
a horse right now?

196
00:09:46,629 --> 00:09:48,518
Joy, what's wrong with you?

197
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:51,130
<i>Joy, say something.
You're weirding me out!</i>

198
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,508
<i>Is anybody home?</i>

199
00:10:01,461 --> 00:10:02,479
Freakhead!

200
00:10:03,857 --> 00:10:04,860
Baby, no!

201
00:10:09,005 --> 00:10:10,630
How about we skip the berries

202
00:10:10,755 --> 00:10:13,027
and go in my car and get a pizza?

203
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:17,198
Earl, you're using too many words.

204
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:18,374
<i>Pizza.</i>

205
00:10:18,499 --> 00:10:20,284
<i>Come on, we go.</i>

206
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:21,742
Rubber face!

207
00:10:25,063 --> 00:10:26,067
Poor guy.

208
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,874
Living out here
eating crazy berries.

209
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:31,923
And doing God knows what
with a raccoon.

210
00:10:32,181 --> 00:10:34,066
We got to bring him back
to civilization.

211
00:10:34,973 --> 00:10:37,283
When we catch Raynard,
can I keep him for a pet?

212
00:10:37,408 --> 00:10:39,254
What? No! He's a person.

213
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:41,623
Here, Raynard!

214
00:10:42,084 --> 00:10:43,084
Here, boy!

215
00:10:44,223 --> 00:10:46,577
Come with us and see
what you've missed.

216
00:10:47,086 --> 00:10:49,094
Remember how you used to like

217
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:51,092
putting a lime in your beer?

218
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:54,223
Well, now they make beer
with the lime already in it.

219
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:55,400
Crazy, huh?

220
00:10:56,439 --> 00:10:59,190
And everybody's got
a phone in their pocket,

221
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:01,826
and a dog in their purse,
and cars fly.

222
00:11:02,064 --> 00:11:04,584
- Everybody's rich!
- We don't want to oversell it.

223
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:12,545
Just try to fight
through the crazy berries and listen.

224
00:11:12,818 --> 00:11:15,668
It's Earl! I'm your friend,
I want to help you.

225
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,176
You know what?

226
00:11:19,606 --> 00:11:21,470
You're not the only one
that can climb a tree.

227
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,180
I'm coming up there after you.

228
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:39,384
"We watched in awe as he ran away,

229
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:41,032
"as sure-footed as a mountain goat.

230
00:11:41,662 --> 00:11:43,242
"As fast as a jackrabbit.

231
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,267
"And we knew we wouldn't be able
to catch him with our strength,

232
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:49,582
"we would have to use our brains."

233
00:11:51,773 --> 00:11:54,836
"The Ape Man used
his primitive skills to escape,

234
00:11:54,961 --> 00:11:56,422
"but we knew we were smarter.

235
00:11:56,905 --> 00:11:58,892
"So, we decided to set a trap.

236
00:11:59,149 --> 00:12:00,574
"And that required bait."

237
00:12:00,699 --> 00:12:03,521
Don't mention this to my boss.
There's a strict policy at the club

238
00:12:03,646 --> 00:12:05,598
against letting people
lure you into the woods.

239
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,040
What kind of freaky crap is that?

240
00:12:38,884 --> 00:12:41,242
There was more
to that relationship than I thought.

241
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:44,275
"In an effort to civilize
this beast man,

242
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,013
"we brought him back to the city.

243
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:50,261
"To see such a monster paraded
through town made people stare.

244
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:52,203
"Most were disgusted

245
00:12:52,328 --> 00:12:54,230
"but some were overcome
with curiosity.

246
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:57,097
"We knew for the creature's own good

247
00:12:57,222 --> 00:12:59,015
"we had to tame it quickly."

248
00:12:59,634 --> 00:13:01,105
What the hell is that idiot doing

249
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,585
with a wild man tied up
in the back of his car?

250
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,086
That Earl and his list.

251
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:07,952
He gets himself in
so many predicaments.

252
00:13:08,122 --> 00:13:10,144
<i>We were in a hurry to get
Raynard back to normal.</i>

253
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:12,921
<i>Luckily, Catalina knew about
something called a colonic</i>

254
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:15,068
<i>that gets all the bad stuff
out of your body.</i>

255
00:13:15,193 --> 00:13:16,196
Aw, man.

256
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:17,774
Bad news, Raynard.

257
00:13:18,042 --> 00:13:20,125
The hose goes in the other end.

258
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,371
Don't worry.

259
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:27,335
I got a G.I. Joe stuck up there
on accident once.

260
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,098
This hose is a lot smaller

261
00:13:29,223 --> 00:13:31,815
and there's no gun
to get caught on anything.

262
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,144
<i>I hoped to never have to give
another dude a forced colonic.</i>

263
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,149
<i>It was good to see Raynard
back in his right mind again.</i>

264
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:42,361
Married?
To a raccoon?

265
00:13:43,382 --> 00:13:45,801
Those must be some powerful berries!

266
00:13:47,162 --> 00:13:48,534
It was a girl raccoon, right?

267
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,521
<i>The next step to get Raynard
back on his feet</i>

268
00:13:55,646 --> 00:13:57,022
<i>was getting him cleaned up.</i>

269
00:13:57,147 --> 00:13:59,297
Is that one a tick or a mole?

270
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:08,087
Mole.

271
00:14:08,364 --> 00:14:09,925
<i>And after we got him cleaned up,</i>

272
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,894
<i>it was time to find him a job.</i>

273
00:14:12,194 --> 00:14:15,267
<i>So, I got him a delivery job
at Camden Foreign Foods.</i>

274
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:17,071
<i>I figured he couldn't mess it up,</i>

275
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:19,694
<i>he just had to hand people food
and take their money.</i>

276
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:21,406
You don't give them the food

277
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:23,861
if they don't give you the money.

278
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:26,864
Yeah, but she gave me
something better than money.

279
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:29,043
We gave her half a chicken,
she gives us

280
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:30,562
a whole chicken.

281
00:14:30,949 --> 00:14:33,204
That's two for one
where I come from, Buttercup.

282
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:34,413
You are fired!

283
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,679
<i>After Señor LoMein didn't work out,</i>

284
00:14:36,804 --> 00:14:39,457
<i>I got Raynard a job somewhere
that standards were so low</i>

285
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:42,515
- <i>I didn't think he'd get in trouble.</i>
- You put the soap on the pillows?

286
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,233
Yeah, it forces you to
get out of the shower

287
00:14:45,358 --> 00:14:47,081
and walk naked,
feel the delightful sting

288
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:48,636
of the clim on your privates.

289
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,223
Really pulls the drawstring
tight on your coin purse, huh?

290
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:55,696
I thought it was candy
on the pillow.

291
00:14:57,414 --> 00:15:00,328
<i>Finally, I found Raynard a job
where it didn't matter how you did it</i>

292
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:02,107
<i>as long as the job got done.</i>

293
00:15:02,455 --> 00:15:05,110
The hell are you doing?
That's the rat hole I was talking about,

294
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,029
you got to spray
the poison in there.

295
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,264
I'm not going to spray in the hole,
I'll spray around the hole.

296
00:15:10,389 --> 00:15:11,825
If the rat comes out of the hole

297
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:13,577
and he steps into the poison,

298
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,954
he steps in the poison
of his own free will.

299
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,916
I don't give a rat's ass about
that rat's ass and his free will.

300
00:15:19,086 --> 00:15:20,793
You won't do it I'll do it myself.

301
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:22,586
No, that's not your choice to make!

302
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:24,964
- It's the rat's choice!
- Give it!

303
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:27,892
How would you like it
if someone sprayed you

304
00:15:28,017 --> 00:15:29,699
inside your house, huh?

305
00:15:31,394 --> 00:15:33,264
Darnell!
Call the police!

306
00:15:33,632 --> 00:15:36,438
The exterminator sprayed me
in the face with rat poison again!

307
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:40,077
<i>I'd had enough of
Raynard's free thinking.</i>

308
00:15:40,202 --> 00:15:42,826
<i>I decided to post his bail
and call it even.</i>

309
00:15:42,951 --> 00:15:46,101
<i>Until I found out
they hadn't taken Raynard to jail.</i>

310
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:53,367
My official diagnosis is A.P.D.

311
00:15:53,954 --> 00:15:56,662
That's
Antisocial Personality Disorder.

312
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,178
And a pretty advanced case, at that.

313
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:00,874
Here, see for yourself.

314
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:03,139
Randy, enough.

315
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:06,505
Santa Claus would not be working
in a mental institution.

316
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:09,466
<i>Why are you so afraid of me, man?
'Cause what?</i>

317
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:11,643
<i>I'm different,
because I sound funny,</i>

318
00:16:11,768 --> 00:16:14,264
<i>'cause I can talk just like
everybody else here if I wanted to!</i>

319
00:16:14,389 --> 00:16:16,389
<i>Would you be more comfortable
if I talk about,</i>

320
00:16:16,514 --> 00:16:17,701
<i>hot dogs and apple pie?</i>

321
00:16:17,826 --> 00:16:20,102
<i>We could tailgate
and drink some light beer</i>

322
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:22,771
<i>or he's afraid of me
because I don't blindly</i>

323
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:26,233
<i>follow your rules because
I'm not a sheep like you!</i>

324
00:16:31,301 --> 00:16:32,869
That was a good one.

325
00:16:34,015 --> 00:16:37,077
Luckily, society has a place
for people like your friend.

326
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:39,171
Do they make toys there?

327
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,514
Don't worry,
he'll be well taken care of

328
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,125
after a couple days on the meds,

329
00:16:43,506 --> 00:16:45,294
well, he won't even need the straps.

330
00:16:45,747 --> 00:16:47,421
- Can I talk to him?
- Of course.

331
00:16:47,691 --> 00:16:49,617
I'll have my assistant take you in.

332
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,198
Would you like to follow me?

333
00:16:57,431 --> 00:16:59,683
Okay, Randy, that's weird.
I admit it.

334
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:03,168
<i>It was sad seeing Raynard
all drugged up</i>

335
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:06,306
<i>but after trying to help him fit in,
I had to agree that</i>

336
00:17:06,431 --> 00:17:08,662
<i>he just didn't belong
in the normal world.</i>

337
00:17:11,835 --> 00:17:14,450
I like candy.
Do you have candy?

338
00:17:14,749 --> 00:17:16,950
- No, do you?
- No, do you?

339
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,841
Hey there, Raynard.

340
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:28,212
How you feeling?

341
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:30,362
Put out your hand.

342
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,149
You thought I was going to let them

343
00:17:39,274 --> 00:17:41,508
take me for a ride on their
monkey train?

344
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,852
How about you untie me,
let's get out of here.

345
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:47,231
I don't think that's the best idea.

346
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:51,527
You should have left me up in the woods
where I was happy, man.

347
00:17:52,396 --> 00:17:55,404
I've tried living in your world.
Look where it got me!

348
00:17:56,071 --> 00:17:58,450
I don't know if you were
really better off out there.

349
00:17:58,881 --> 00:18:01,009
You were hallucinating
on crazy berries.

350
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,884
I'm not going to eat
anymore of those damn berries.

351
00:18:04,009 --> 00:18:06,459
Please, the next time
I see a raccoon,

352
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:09,023
we're just going to be friends.

353
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:13,215
Come on, Earl.
I'm dying here.

354
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:15,482
<i>Raynard was right.</i>

355
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:18,258
<i>He didn't belong locked up
and pumped full of drugs.</i>

356
00:18:18,383 --> 00:18:20,033
<i>He belonged in the wild.</i>

357
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:23,350
<i>I just had to figure out
how to get him back there.</i>

358
00:18:27,195 --> 00:18:28,258
Yo, buddy.

359
00:18:28,383 --> 00:18:31,337
Will you help me do a magic
trick to entertain the folks?

360
00:18:31,462 --> 00:18:32,468
Sure.

361
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,892
Hey, everybody.
Check this out.

362
00:18:46,787 --> 00:18:48,589
This guy is full of candy.

363
00:18:48,835 --> 00:18:50,675
Like a giant piñata.

364
00:18:52,902 --> 00:18:53,964
Candy!

365
00:19:15,382 --> 00:19:17,932
Sorry I got to take
the Bookmobile back.

366
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:20,505
You're all right with the tent?

367
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,201
Yeah, man. Take it back.

368
00:19:22,566 --> 00:19:24,130
That thing's way too restrictive.

369
00:19:24,255 --> 00:19:26,497
Besides, I already read
or ate most of the books.

370
00:19:29,278 --> 00:19:30,470
You hear that?

371
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:32,507
Hear what?

372
00:19:32,965 --> 00:19:35,506
Exactly.
That's the sound of freedom.

373
00:19:37,615 --> 00:19:40,093
And that chirping is
the sound of Sharlene in heat.

374
00:19:40,627 --> 00:19:42,387
That's going to be
a tough conversation.

375
00:19:42,894 --> 00:19:45,599
I could hit her with the Bookmobile
on my way out.

376
00:19:46,145 --> 00:19:47,727
I don't want to know.

377
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:52,168
Thanks for everything, Earl.
Thanks for bringing me home.

378
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:58,669
"At last, he was returned
to where he belonged.

379
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:01,777
"What we had once feared
we came to admire.

380
00:20:02,565 --> 00:20:05,615
"He had the courage
to think freely, to live freely.

381
00:20:06,378 --> 00:20:07,528
"To truly live.

382
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:10,712
"He was Trazan.
King of the Jungle."

383
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:14,002
The end.

384
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,255
<i>I was glad to bring
the Bookmobile back.</i>

385
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,128
<i>Those books were going
to help the kids</i>

386
00:20:21,253 --> 00:20:23,126
<i>see the world a whole new way.</i>

387
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:24,972
<i>Kind of like Raynard did for me.</i>

388
00:20:25,142 --> 00:20:26,682
Where did Trazan live?

389
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:30,604
The story takes place in Africa.

390
00:20:31,557 --> 00:20:32,771
Which is down here.

391
00:20:33,441 --> 00:20:35,479
Or another way to look at it,

392
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:40,429
is that it's up here.

393
00:20:41,495 --> 00:20:43,282
Makes you think, doesn't it?

394
00:20:44,763 --> 00:20:46,616
A map is also the Earth?

395
00:20:47,956 --> 00:20:49,648
