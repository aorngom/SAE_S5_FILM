1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:03,123
<i>You know the kind of guy who confesses
to a crime he didn't commit</i>

2
00:00:03,431 --> 00:00:05,467
<i>so his ex-wife won't have
to go to prison?</i>

3
00:00:05,679 --> 00:00:07,602
<i>The kind of guy
who leaves his brother all alone</i>

4
00:00:07,846 --> 00:00:10,297
<i>and his friends
with nothing to jump for?</i>

5
00:00:10,557 --> 00:00:12,089
<i>Well, that's me.</i>

6
00:00:12,307 --> 00:00:14,014
<i>And for the next two years,</i>

7
00:00:14,315 --> 00:00:17,929
<i>my name is Inmate #28301-016.</i>

8
00:00:20,432 --> 00:00:22,468
<i>I survived my first night in prison,</i>

9
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:27,171
<i>but I was terrified wondering
what the next 729 days had in store.</i>

10
00:00:27,474 --> 00:00:29,171
<i>But I was hoping I'd be okay</i>

11
00:00:29,438 --> 00:00:32,144
<i>since I had my good friend Ralph
with me to watch my back.</i>

12
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:38,106
Come on.
Out of your bunk, hands off junk.

15
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:54,251
<i>Hey, buddy, if you're reading this,
by now you know I'm long gone.</i>

16
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:56,432
<i>I had to get out
of this godforsaken hellhole.</i>

17
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:58,797
<i>I would have taken you,
but I got hungry last night</i>

18
00:00:59,043 --> 00:01:01,394
<i>and I ate the other melon.
Sorry about that.</i>

19
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:02,845
<i>Your buddy, Ralph.</i>

20
00:01:03,054 --> 00:01:06,444
<i>PS: I made mouth hole in the melon
for you if you get my drift!</i>

21
00:01:06,703 --> 00:01:07,906
<i>Rock and roll!</i>

22
00:01:11,374 --> 00:01:13,370
<i>Turns out Ralph paroled himself and</i>

23
00:01:13,627 --> 00:01:18,001
<i>left me with a broken water melon head
and a lot of explaing to do.</i>

24
00:01:19,928 --> 00:01:21,910
Escape attempt! Cell block seven!

25
00:01:25,871 --> 00:01:26,939
<i>Lockdown! </i>

26
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,740
<i>Since there was a hole in my cell,
I was moved to general population.</i>

27
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:49,337
<i>So lent from sharing a private cell
with my childhood friend</i>

28
00:01:49,628 --> 00:01:52,608
<i>to joining a two-year slumber party
with murderers and rapists.</i>

29
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:59,146
<i>I'd been to county lockup
plenty of times, but</i>

30
00:01:59,372 --> 00:02:00,807
<i>never been to prison.</i>

31
00:02:01,046 --> 00:02:03,247
<i>And prison life took
some getting used to.</i>

32
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:06,768
<i>A typical day in prison can be
broken down into several activities.</i>

33
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:09,613
<i>First, you wake up and
make sure nothing's happened </i>

34
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:11,647
<i>to your two most important things.</i>

35
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:23,536
<i>Next, you head over
to the mess hall for breakfast.</i>

36
00:02:27,808 --> 00:02:29,366
You going to eat your steak?

37
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:32,255
<i>Then you spend most of your day
trying not to get too bored.</i>

38
00:02:32,535 --> 00:02:33,587
Seven.

39
00:02:34,025 --> 00:02:35,186
Three.

40
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:36,494
Five.

41
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,832
Six.

42
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:39,342
Two.

43
00:02:40,214 --> 00:02:41,239
Nine.

44
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:42,865
Nice.

45
00:02:45,776 --> 00:02:47,580
<i>Finally, it's time for bed.</i>

46
00:02:47,903 --> 00:02:50,035
<i>And that's the hardest time of all
because</i>

47
00:02:50,363 --> 00:02:52,264
<i>then you're alone
with just your thoughts.</i>

48
00:03:10,002 --> 00:03:12,134
<i>The only thing that breaks the routine</i>

49
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:14,346
is when one prisoner tries
to kill another.

50
00:03:14,661 --> 00:03:16,807
<i>If you're lucky, you're not the victim.</i>

51
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:19,236
<i>Lockdown!</i>

52
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:25,483
<i>But no matter what,
you still get punished.</i>

53
00:03:26,086 --> 00:03:27,527
<i>And everyone gets searched.</i>

54
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:30,744
<i>Thoroughly searched.</i>

55
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:32,912
<i>Not surprisingly,</i>

56
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,597
<i>prison was turning out
to be a miserable place.</i>

57
00:03:36,022 --> 00:03:39,588
<i>But the one bright spot was visiting day
when I got to see my friends.</i>

58
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:41,693
<i>Some friends I got to see
more of than others.</i>

59
00:03:41,962 --> 00:03:45,662
You don't realize what you're doing
to them coming in dressed like that.

60
00:03:45,947 --> 00:03:47,433
I don't like to change at work.

61
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,449
There's a new girl who steals your pants

62
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:51,970
and then sells them back to you
at unreasonable prices.

63
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:55,248
What do you got there?

64
00:03:55,543 --> 00:03:58,063
Oh, I'm not ready yet, Earl.
You go ahead, Darnell.

65
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,359
Here you go, Earl.

66
00:03:59,619 --> 00:04:03,925
Sometimes incarcerated people use
their time to get closer with God.

67
00:04:04,438 --> 00:04:07,786
Those are some books I found to be
helpful on my journey to find religion.

68
00:04:09,109 --> 00:04:10,162
Holy Bible.

69
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,653
The Torah.

70
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,122
<i>Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret.</i>

71
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:20,943
So where's Joy?

72
00:04:21,183 --> 00:04:23,292
She's feeling guilty
about you going to prison.

73
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:25,743
She didn't want to come empty-handed.

74
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:28,620
I give up. I am just not crafty.

75
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:30,108
What's the matter?

76
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:31,880
This damn glass portrait of Earl.

77
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,489
I just can't make it give off
his angelic essence.

78
00:04:34,754 --> 00:04:36,948
I even stole half this glass
from a church window.

79
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:41,366
I like it. It looks like Earl'd look
if he was made out of glass.

80
00:04:41,722 --> 00:04:43,328
Does it matter if you like it?

81
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:45,578
Were you the hero
that sacrificed your freedom

82
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:48,585
to save me from prison having to pee
in front of a woman named Trudy?

83
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:51,654
This is not good enough for Earl.
I hate it!

84
00:04:53,128 --> 00:04:54,686
I'll get the broom.

85
00:04:56,404 --> 00:04:59,711
She'll come visit once the search
for the church window thief dies down.

86
00:05:00,035 --> 00:05:01,597
There's a lot of heat right now.

87
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:04,272
It could be a while.
They were Lutherans.

88
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:06,062
Everybody quiet.

89
00:05:06,317 --> 00:05:07,321
It's my turn.

90
00:05:08,244 --> 00:05:09,460
First question:

91
00:05:10,021 --> 00:05:11,999
Where do we hide the toothpaste?

92
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:14,037
Behind the mirror.

93
00:05:15,339 --> 00:05:17,612
The bathroom mirror.
Pulls open from the left.

94
00:05:19,633 --> 00:05:21,057
A secret compartment.

95
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:23,959
Your visiting time is over.

96
00:05:25,111 --> 00:05:26,232
Thanks for coming.

97
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:30,456
No. Darnell talked the whole time.
I hardly got to ask any of my questions.

98
00:05:30,784 --> 00:05:32,661
Earl, how do you set the alarm clock?

99
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:34,516
And what's our apartment number again?

100
00:05:35,891 --> 00:05:36,998
I miss you.

101
00:05:37,765 --> 00:05:40,961
<i>I would have worried more about
how Randy was gonna make it on his own,</i>

102
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,509
<i>but I was more worried
how I was gonna survive.</i>

103
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,867
<i>When you're the new guy in prison,
everyone sizes you up.</i>

104
00:05:48,209 --> 00:05:49,890
<i>And they test you daily.</i>

105
00:05:53,581 --> 00:05:56,792
<i>One thing I do know is you can't let
people think you're a punk.</i>

106
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:59,798
<i>And I'd always heard the best way
to earn respect in prison</i>

107
00:06:00,184 --> 00:06:02,932
<i>is to walk u to the biggest guy and
punch him as hard as you can.</i>

108
00:06:14,504 --> 00:06:17,414
<i>Unfortunately, the closer I got,
the bigger he seemed,</i>

109
00:06:17,674 --> 00:06:19,075
<i>and I lost my nerve.</i>

110
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:24,045
<i>The problem is, the gangs in prison are
divided up like my dad's sock drawer,</i>

111
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:25,289
<i>by color.</i>

112
00:06:25,557 --> 00:06:27,466
<i>I was too white to join the Latino gang,</i>

113
00:06:27,726 --> 00:06:28,884
<i>the Asian gang</i>

114
00:06:29,144 --> 00:06:30,352
<i>or the Black gang.</i>

115
00:06:30,694 --> 00:06:33,140
<i>And not white enough
to join the Albino gang.</i>

116
00:06:33,404 --> 00:06:36,151
I'm telling you, we got to take back
the shady part of the yard.

117
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:39,992
<i>So I went with the only gang that might
take me, the white supremacists.</i>

118
00:06:40,615 --> 00:06:43,745
<i>Which meant unlearning what every
after-school special had taught me:</i>

119
00:06:43,991 --> 00:06:45,149
<i>don't be yourself.</i>

120
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:48,808
Hey, who else thinks the Civil War
ain't over, it's just halftime?

121
00:06:52,503 --> 00:06:54,895
I'm just saying, I don't see
why I have to shave my head.

122
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,083
Hate's is in your heart,
not in your hair.

123
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:02,897
Forget it. I'm out.

124
00:07:04,192 --> 00:07:07,516
Geez, you'd think the superior race
wouldn't be so threatened by new ideas?

125
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:11,802
<i>I had just about given up hope
of finding a gang to join when</i>

126
00:07:12,077 --> 00:07:14,375
<i>finally I saw a crowd
I thought I could hang with,</i>

127
00:07:14,736 --> 00:07:15,843
<i>the old-timers.</i>

128
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,004
<i>The one group that had obviously
figured out how to survive in prison.</i>

129
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:22,749
Come on. You can't put me all in.
You only got one cashew.

130
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,934
Hey, guys, got room for one more?

131
00:07:25,223 --> 00:07:27,192
Sure thing, young man. Take a seat.

132
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:31,979
I'm Charlie, this is Whisky Pete,

133
00:07:32,212 --> 00:07:33,281
Philadelphia Mike,

134
00:07:33,518 --> 00:07:35,617
John and Skinny John

135
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:37,494
and old Dirty Neck.

136
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:42,942
That sure is one dirty neck.

137
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:44,979
I'm Skinny John, you jackass.

138
00:07:47,096 --> 00:07:49,181
<i>They might not have been
the toughest gang,</i>

139
00:07:49,331 --> 00:07:50,547
<i>but they were a gang</i>

140
00:07:50,693 --> 00:07:54,556
<i>and they had figured out how survive,
and that made me feel safer.</i>

141
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:57,986
Greta Garbo, Judy Garland and Mae West.

142
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,927
That's easy.
I'd take Greta Garbo for a milkshake,

143
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,546
Mae West to the drive-in,
and I'd kill Judy Garland.

144
00:08:05,062 --> 00:08:06,709
Who would you take to the drive-in?

145
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,808
No, that's okay, you guys play.

146
00:08:09,054 --> 00:08:10,257
Don't you like broads?

147
00:08:10,543 --> 00:08:11,664
No, I love broads.

148
00:08:11,924 --> 00:08:13,843
You don't like talking
about killing broads?

149
00:08:14,929 --> 00:08:18,595
I don't know. It just seems kinda creepy
'cause all those broads e dead.

150
00:08:19,671 --> 00:08:21,319
Was there a plane crash or something?

151
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:25,972
How long have you guys been in here?

152
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:31,399
<i>And then realized the reason they let me
in their gang wasn't for my survival,</i>

153
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:32,741
<i>it was for theirs.</i>

154
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:36,194
You're not taking our nuts anymore,
you big palooka!

155
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,409
We got us some young blood now!

156
00:08:39,907 --> 00:08:41,027
Get him, Earl!

157
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:54,784
Pistachio?

158
00:09:01,848 --> 00:09:04,292
You like it? I used up all my felt.

159
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:07,128
It's amazing.
These are all scenes from my life?

160
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:09,814
It's like a straight version
of one of those AIDS quilts.

161
00:09:10,139 --> 00:09:11,916
Thank you, Joy, I won't forget this.

162
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:15,383
That's when I got chicken pox,
and you were...

163
00:09:16,975 --> 00:09:18,315
off banging Darnell.

164
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,011
I was trying to be accurate.

165
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:26,808
You hate it. I knew you'd hate it.

166
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:29,286
I don't hate it. I said it was nice.

167
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:31,227
No, I see how it is.

168
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:33,592
I mean, you like me feeling guilty.

169
00:09:33,855 --> 00:09:37,359
No matter how many of the kids' coats
I cut up for you, we'll never be even

170
00:09:37,707 --> 00:09:39,957
because you like holding this
over my head, don't you?

171
00:09:40,239 --> 00:09:42,091
Well, bravo, you son of a bitch!

172
00:09:43,976 --> 00:09:45,657
Do I have time for a question right now?

173
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:47,661
You wait your damn turn,
you stupid yeti.

174
00:09:47,945 --> 00:09:51,430
Would you tell your brother to stop
calling me asking me what time it is?

175
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:53,163
Dumbass already lost his job.

176
00:09:53,403 --> 00:09:56,443
That's cause no one will show me how
to set this thing. I'm not a scientist.

177
00:09:58,923 --> 00:10:00,344
What's your question?

178
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,992
Can I borrow money
for the vending machine?

179
00:10:05,327 --> 00:10:07,391
You're the one with access
to the bank account.

180
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,383
The bank closes at 5:00.
My clock always says it's 12:00 AM.

181
00:10:10,748 --> 00:10:11,971
You want some change?

182
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:13,457
Go fetch.

183
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:19,148
I swear that boy's not going
to survive without you.

184
00:10:19,458 --> 00:10:22,773
He keeps carrying one of your old shirts
cause he misses your smell.

185
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,967
Yeah, he seems to be having
a little trouble letting go.

186
00:10:32,815 --> 00:10:36,341
How'd you sleep last night?
It was scary out here. I saw a possum.

187
00:10:38,064 --> 00:10:40,332
Wait a second...
if you want things to be even with us,

188
00:10:40,635 --> 00:10:43,492
how about you let him move in with you,
keep an eye on him for me?

189
00:10:43,758 --> 00:10:47,200
Oh, no. On the way over here, he got
his hand stuck in the tape deck...

190
00:10:47,344 --> 00:10:48,793
I can't put up with that crap.

191
00:10:48,958 --> 00:10:51,391
Come on, Joy, you said
you wanted to even the score.

192
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,210
I mean, this could really help.

193
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:59,421
All right. I'll do it.

194
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:02,545
Can you throw more money on the floor?

195
00:11:02,859 --> 00:11:04,730
I want to get myself a nice, cold drink.

196
00:11:10,931 --> 00:11:12,120
You know what?

197
00:11:12,523 --> 00:11:13,821
This might be fun.

198
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:17,476
<i>Now that I knew Randy
would looked out for,</i>

199
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,274
<i>I could get back to figuring out
how to look out for myself.</i>

200
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,337
<i>Sonny was a guy I used to play
Beer Can Tag with back in the day.</i>

201
00:11:29,634 --> 00:11:31,019
I got you, Earl.

202
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,522
Ain't no use running, fool! I know
where your ma pas your house!

203
00:11:37,099 --> 00:11:39,068
<i>After that, Sonny just disappeared.</i>

204
00:11:39,719 --> 00:11:41,797
Everybody's always asking
what happened to you.

205
00:11:42,811 --> 00:11:45,473
I mean...
for the first couple weeks anyway then

206
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:47,302
you know, life goes on.

207
00:11:48,539 --> 00:11:51,840
I can't believe you got two years
for hitting a cop with an beer can.

208
00:11:52,582 --> 00:11:55,487
Yeah, well, I also kind of wrestled
the cop's gun away

209
00:11:56,061 --> 00:11:59,066
and drove around with him
in the trunk of his car for a few hours.

210
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,730
It was crazy day.

211
00:12:01,156 --> 00:12:03,069
How come this is the first time
I've seen you?

212
00:12:03,982 --> 00:12:06,565
Because this is the first time
I wanted you see me.

213
00:12:07,002 --> 00:12:11,230
<i>Turns out, Sonny figured out another way
to survive in prison... be invisible.</i>

214
00:12:11,695 --> 00:12:13,676
<i>And he agreed to teach me how to do it.</i>

215
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:17,928
<i>I learned things like two fat guys
on a bench didn't have to be scary,</i>

216
00:12:18,216 --> 00:12:21,196
<i>They could also be a nice. shady
place to hide and play cards.</i>

217
00:12:36,098 --> 00:12:38,872
<i>And if you didn't mind scorching
hot water and wrinkled feet,</i>

218
00:12:39,132 --> 00:12:41,770
<i>you could hide out in the showers
practically alI day.</i>

219
00:12:45,547 --> 00:12:48,853
<i>And if you could deal with not chewing
your food and a little indigestion,</i>

220
00:12:49,141 --> 00:12:52,216
<i>you don't have to spit on your lunch
so no one will take it from you.</i>

221
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:04,170
You press the "setime" button
to set the time.

222
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,436
And you press the "set alarm" button
to set the alarm.

223
00:13:09,472 --> 00:13:11,372
"Set the time" to set the time

224
00:13:11,849 --> 00:13:13,653
"Set the alarm" to set the alarm.

225
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:15,676
Why didn't you tell me it rimes?

226
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:17,128
There you go.

227
00:13:17,416 --> 00:13:20,149
Have a good night. If you need anything,
we'll be right back there.

228
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:23,894
If possible, could you try not to need
anything for the next 20 minutes or so?

229
00:13:24,183 --> 00:13:26,634
We're going to go...
balance the checkbook.

230
00:13:28,031 --> 00:13:29,097
No, wait.

231
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,647
Earl usually talks to me
till I fall asleep.

232
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,143
The checkbook.
I've got to transfer some funds, baby.

233
00:13:37,505 --> 00:13:40,024
I'll be right in.
You go sharpen your pencil.

234
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:43,153
You know we're not really
balancing the checkbook?

235
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,456
You got three minutes
or else he finishes without me.

236
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:50,964
- What do you want to talk about?
- Time travel.

237
00:13:51,473 --> 00:13:52,552
Horses.

238
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,691
- All right, horses.
- No, no, ...

239
00:13:55,006 --> 00:13:56,134
Seahorses.

240
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,688
Seahorses in space...

241
00:13:59,236 --> 00:14:00,288
travel.

242
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,065
No. Time travel.

243
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:06,243
So, you got a girl waiting
for you on the outside?

244
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:09,116
Well, I was starting to see
this deaf lawyer lady,

245
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:12,342
but once I got into prison, we decided
to star seeing other people.

246
00:14:12,677 --> 00:14:14,105
That's a better deal for her.

247
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,060
I figured that out,
but it was after I'd already agreed.

248
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:21,381
- Sorry, man.
- No problem.

249
00:14:21,683 --> 00:14:23,901
You're new here, right? Want candy bar?

250
00:14:24,538 --> 00:14:26,588
- Really? Thanks
- No!

251
00:14:26,902 --> 00:14:29,116
Walk away. Walk away.

252
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:32,586
What part of "stay invisible"
don't you understand?

253
00:14:32,892 --> 00:14:35,297
- It was just a candy bar.
- "Just a candy bar"?

254
00:14:35,552 --> 00:14:38,008
You almost just fell
for the oldest prison scam there is.

255
00:14:38,336 --> 00:14:39,880
He wants you to owe him something.

256
00:14:40,181 --> 00:14:42,010
Today he "gives" you a Snickers bar.

257
00:14:42,286 --> 00:14:44,137
Tomorrow, he's going
to expect a Zagnut bar.

258
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,194
Do you know where to get a Zagnut bar?

259
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:49,964
Damn. 'Cause I owe a guy one.
I don't know if they make them anymore.

260
00:14:50,926 --> 00:14:54,723
Some guy gave me a candy bar once,
a real maniac, now I owe him a favor.

261
00:14:55,037 --> 00:14:57,264
In prison, a favor can get you killed.

262
00:14:57,568 --> 00:14:59,830
So trust me, do not owe anybody anything

263
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:02,924
and stay invisible. You might make it
out of here in one piece.

264
00:15:06,763 --> 00:15:07,801
Oh, crap.

265
00:15:08,109 --> 00:15:10,720
- What's wrong?
- That's Glen Shipy. I know him.

266
00:15:11,033 --> 00:15:13,042
<i>When I knew Glen, he was a Camden Scout.</i>

267
00:15:13,338 --> 00:15:16,673
<i>Even though you only had to wear
uniform if you were going to a meeting,</i>

268
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,291
<i>Glen was so proud, he wore it every day.</i>

269
00:15:19,605 --> 00:15:22,257
<i>The regular scouts
left Camden County years before</i>

270
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:26,714
<i>when a local militia group got caught
using the scouts to round up aliens.</i>

271
00:15:33,521 --> 00:15:35,521
<i>So, in Camden, we had Camden outs,</i>

272
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:40,051
<i>and back when I was an amateur criminal,
I often used them as accomplices.</i>

273
00:15:40,402 --> 00:15:42,479
So what happened was, I lost my key

274
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:45,275
I need to get in there
so I could get my TV

275
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:48,422
and VCR and anything else
expensive I happen to see.

276
00:15:49,328 --> 00:15:52,130
If I boost you up through the window,
will you open the door for me?

277
00:15:52,476 --> 00:15:55,038
The Camden Scout motto
is "Always be helpful".

278
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,710
It's got my neskerchief!

279
00:16:10,766 --> 00:16:12,679
Seems like that guy
should be on your list.

280
00:16:13,021 --> 00:16:15,227
He is. I think he's
number one hundred and something.

281
00:16:15,573 --> 00:16:18,666
- Do you think he still remembers you?
- I don't plan to find out.

282
00:16:19,076 --> 00:16:21,728
<i>I'd never turned my back
on someone on my list before.</i>

283
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:23,296
<i>It just wasn't like me.</i>

284
00:16:23,665 --> 00:16:26,087
<i>But I realized that
if I was going to survive in prison,</i>

285
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,127
<i>I wasn't going to be able
to be like myself.</i>

286
00:16:29,903 --> 00:16:32,281
The fat guys are on the move.
Get ready to hitch a ride.

287
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:38,896
I see you, Earl Hickey!

288
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:49,804
<i>Lockdown!</i>

289
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:54,955
I'm coming for you, Earl.

290
00:16:55,285 --> 00:16:56,768
I am going to rip off your ears,

291
00:16:57,055 --> 00:17:00,681
shove them up your butt just
so you can hear me kicking your ass!

292
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:06,511
<i>When they want you to cool off,
they put you in the Hot Box,</i>

293
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,529
<i>which doesn't make much sense,</i>

294
00:17:08,857 --> 00:17:11,029
<i>but neither than put
violent criminals together</i>

295
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,147
<i>and expecting them
not to break the rules.</i>

296
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:14,719
Where are you, Earl Hickey?

297
00:17:15,183 --> 00:17:16,379
I'm gonna find you!

298
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:19,302
I'm gonna track you down
and wear your pelt!

299
00:17:22,555 --> 00:17:23,634
I see you!

300
00:17:24,147 --> 00:17:25,678
You're hiding behind the fat guy!

301
00:17:27,923 --> 00:17:29,972
Now you're hiding behind the skinny guy.

302
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,912
That doesn't even make sense.

303
00:17:38,428 --> 00:17:41,107
<i>Sonny had ratted me out,
and I wanted to know why.</i>

304
00:17:44,353 --> 00:17:45,999
II'm sorry, I'm sorry.

305
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:49,289
Remember I told you
I owed some guy a Zagnut bar?

306
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,326
- Well, Glen is the guy.
- I should kick your ass.

307
00:17:54,518 --> 00:17:57,661
Look. You're making a scene.
Invisible. Invisible. Inwisible.

308
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,951
Invisible? You blew that for me.

309
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:03,770
- Now Glen can see me clear as day.
- Yeah, but I'm still invisible.

310
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,640
Come on, please.

311
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:14,142
Okay, look.

312
00:18:14,518 --> 00:18:16,718
I'm trying to stay calm with this here.

313
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:19,647
What are we gonna do about this?

314
00:18:24,587 --> 00:18:25,701
Son of a bitch.

315
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:35,860
<i>Lockdown!</i>

316
00:18:36,571 --> 00:18:38,962
<i>All I would have had to do
was stay away from Glen...</i>

317
00:18:42,221 --> 00:18:44,818
<i>but as it turned out,
Karma had a different plan.</i>

318
00:18:45,146 --> 00:18:47,482
- You're a dead man, Earl Hickey!
- Holy Moses!

319
00:18:48,203 --> 00:18:49,749
I'm gonna kill you, Earl.

320
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,826
I'm going to rip off your face
and wear it to the Ugly Ball.

321
00:18:53,195 --> 00:18:54,890
That's scary and hurtful, Glen.

322
00:18:55,247 --> 00:18:56,285
You're a dead man.

323
00:18:56,676 --> 00:18:58,453
<i>My Uncle Roger once had a pet pig.</i>

324
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:00,825
<i>Mostly it was an okay animal,</i>

325
00:19:01,154 --> 00:19:04,183
<i>but when it got mad you just had
to stand back and let it squeal.</i>

326
00:19:04,497 --> 00:19:06,424
<i>So I decided to handle Glen
the same way.</i>

327
00:19:06,716 --> 00:19:08,766
I'm going to wear you
like a puppet on my fist

328
00:19:09,088 --> 00:19:12,152
and then get in a punch fight
with a man made of razor blades!

329
00:19:12,801 --> 00:19:15,124
<i>While I was trying to keep
from getting killed by Glen,</i>

330
00:19:15,452 --> 00:19:17,967
<i>Joy was trying to keep Randy
from getting killed by Randy.</i>

331
00:19:18,802 --> 00:19:20,388
What the hell are you doing?

332
00:19:22,462 --> 00:19:24,334
You almost walked out
in front of that truck.

333
00:19:24,879 --> 00:19:27,216
I don't look where I'm going.
It's kind of my thing.

334
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,095
But just let me know if
I'm about to walk into something...

335
00:19:30,438 --> 00:19:31,695
like Earl does.

336
00:19:32,142 --> 00:19:36,120
<i>Although she was discovering that
he took more care of than she expected.</i>

337
00:19:36,536 --> 00:19:38,204
It's so beautiful.

338
00:19:39,864 --> 00:19:43,131
That thing zaps bugs. What do you think
it's going to do to your finger?

339
00:19:43,483 --> 00:19:44,658
Yeah, you're right.

340
00:19:49,051 --> 00:19:51,032
For the love of God, pick something.

341
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:54,222
I'm sorry,
I usually just order what Earl gets.

342
00:19:54,556 --> 00:19:56,325
Well, Randy, I talked to the prison,

343
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:59,791
and they said Earl was having
duck "à l'orange" and caviar pie.

344
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:01,929
I think the guy was being facetis.

345
00:20:02,261 --> 00:20:04,736
But we don't have it anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

346
00:20:05,478 --> 00:20:07,586
We may not know what Earl would order,

347
00:20:07,704 --> 00:20:10,686
but we could find out
what "Little Earl" would order.

348
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:11,646
Stop it!

349
00:20:11,809 --> 00:20:13,711
He is getting way too dependent
on that thing.

350
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,628
"Grilled cheese looks
pretty good, Randy."

351
00:20:15,741 --> 00:20:16,923
<i>And after two days,</i>

352
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:19,213
<i>the only thing keeping Joy
from killing Randy was...</i>

353
00:20:19,303 --> 00:20:20,579
<i>the promise she made to me.</i>

354
00:20:20,704 --> 00:20:21,848
All right, fine!

355
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:24,591
I'll warn you if you're about
to walk into something.

356
00:20:25,283 --> 00:20:26,394
Don't walk.

357
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:31,391
Okay, walk.

358
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:33,707
Go...

359
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,689
I feel like I'm praying Frogger.

360
00:20:42,014 --> 00:20:45,222
<i>Turns out, Glen had a little bit
more stamina than Uncle Roger's pig.</i>

361
00:20:45,398 --> 00:20:46,950
<i>Probably 'cause Glen didn't smoke.</i>

362
00:20:47,030 --> 00:20:48,552
I'm gonna yank out your skeleton,

363
00:20:48,703 --> 00:20:50,678
like a cartoon bear eating a fish

364
00:20:51,219 --> 00:20:53,080
and use it to beat your soul!

365
00:20:53,596 --> 00:20:55,670
I'm going to stick a broom
down your throat,

366
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,626
flip you upside-down,
take you to the barber,

367
00:20:57,886 --> 00:21:00,321
sweep up all the dirty hair.
I'm gonna rip off your skin,

368
00:21:00,836 --> 00:21:02,291
and wear it like a track suit.

369
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:04,645
Then I'm gonna roll around
in broken glass

370
00:21:04,725 --> 00:21:06,539
and then put you back in it.

371
00:21:06,619 --> 00:21:07,997
I'm gonna rip off your hands

372
00:21:08,494 --> 00:21:09,915
and put them where your feet go,

373
00:21:10,104 --> 00:21:12,468
rip off your feet and put them
where your hands go.

374
00:21:12,808 --> 00:21:15,123
I'm going to point at you,
and I'm gonna laugh.

375
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:16,481
<i>But eventually,</i>

376
00:21:16,633 --> 00:21:18,796
<i>even tar-free lungs wear themselves out.</i>

377
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:20,320
I'm gonna rip out your hair...

378
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,940
put it in a jar...

379
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,503
I don't know...

380
00:21:25,336 --> 00:21:26,780
Mail it to the Pope...

381
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,545
with a salmon.

382
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,158
First I'd like to say
that I'm impressed with...

383
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:39,460
the creative ways
you thought of killing me.

384
00:21:40,139 --> 00:21:42,039
That one with my heart
as a cue ball and...

385
00:21:42,341 --> 00:21:43,485
apes playing pool?

386
00:21:44,026 --> 00:21:44,970
Scary.

387
00:21:45,886 --> 00:21:48,100
But are you sure you got the right guy?
I mean,

388
00:21:48,464 --> 00:21:51,514
I vaguely remember
hearing about you

389
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:52,958
falling in a window and,

390
00:21:53,168 --> 00:21:56,519
maybe, I don't know,
something about a dog or something.

391
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:58,375
Something about a dog?

392
00:21:59,494 --> 00:22:00,814
There were two of them

393
00:22:01,085 --> 00:22:02,179
attacking me!

394
00:22:02,443 --> 00:22:04,808
They fought over my body!

395
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:08,103
<i>That's when I found out
the dog attack was just the beginning.</i>

396
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,350
<i>Glen was arrested
for breaking and entering,</i>

397
00:22:13,430 --> 00:22:14,990
<i>burglary, and vandalism.</i>

398
00:22:16,926 --> 00:22:19,814
<i>And when the police dog
broke a tooth on in a shin bone,</i>

399
00:22:19,894 --> 00:22:21,994
<i>he was also charged with
assaulting an officer.</i>

400
00:22:23,051 --> 00:22:25,416
That stupid judge sent me to juvie
for six months.

401
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:28,040
Got in a fight, got more time.

402
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,107
Got in another fight, slimed a guard,

403
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:32,045
tried to escape, got out,

404
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:34,787
stole something, went back in, got out,

405
00:22:35,401 --> 00:22:37,499
robbed a mini mall,
threw rocks at the mayor.

406
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:40,438
If I think about it,
everything I did was your fault.

407
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,316
I don't know if you can really
blame me for everything, I mean,

408
00:22:46,638 --> 00:22:48,160
personal choice seems to...

409
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:51,198
I will twist your yam-sack
like a balloon animal!

410
00:22:52,545 --> 00:22:54,175
You know, on second thought,
I can see

411
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:56,087
how you could
connect the dots like that.

412
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,197
Look,

413
00:22:57,647 --> 00:22:59,828
how about I do something
to make us even?

414
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,216
Like, uh...

415
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,247
I hear you like candy bars.

416
00:23:04,871 --> 00:23:07,609
I got some people on the outside
who could track down a...

417
00:23:07,689 --> 00:23:08,896
a Zagnuts.

418
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:11,173
Make me a shiv.

419
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:13,620
A shiv like a knife?

420
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:17,008
Or like an ice pick, or an axe,
or a cheese slicer.

421
00:23:17,128 --> 00:23:18,345
Surprise me.

422
00:23:18,434 --> 00:23:21,830
<i>Generally, I tried not to break rules
in order to cross things off my list,</i>

423
00:23:22,044 --> 00:23:25,000
<i>but I wasn't as worried about my list
as I was about surviving.</i>

424
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:27,101
<i>And besides, I wasn't me anymore.</i>

425
00:23:27,276 --> 00:23:30,237
<i>I was prisoner number 28301-016.</i>

426
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:32,421
Okay. A shiv it is.

427
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,533
What, Randy?

428
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:48,562
<i>Do you know if that TV show Riptide
is gonna be on tonight?</i>

429
00:23:48,642 --> 00:23:51,271
I swear to God, Darnell,
I can't keep living like this.

430
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,650
That show hasn't been on for 20 years!

431
00:23:56,217 --> 00:23:58,067
<i>Then what's the show I'm thinking of?</i>

432
00:23:58,154 --> 00:23:59,748
<i>You know, the one with the monkey?</i>

433
00:23:59,903 --> 00:24:03,105
- I think he means B. J. and the Bear.
- Don't you dare tell him that.

434
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:06,092
Once he knows, he'll start telling us
about every episode.

435
00:24:07,352 --> 00:24:09,830
<i>Oh, wait.
I think it's B. J. and the Bear.</i>

436
00:24:09,918 --> 00:24:10,937
Damn it.

437
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:13,489
<i>Remember the one
where they were driving</i>

438
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,718
<i>that semi together?</i>

439
00:24:14,798 --> 00:24:17,402
Okay, that's it. This ends now.

440
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:21,037
Push.

441
00:24:24,914 --> 00:24:27,038
Why would B. J. name his monkey "Bear"?

442
00:24:27,579 --> 00:24:29,182
Because BJ was a huge Alabama fan

443
00:24:29,262 --> 00:24:31,245
and he named him after
the coach "Bear" Bryant.

444
00:24:31,325 --> 00:24:32,922
You happy?
Now listen, we gotta talk.

445
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:35,653
As you know, I promised Earl
I would take care of you...

446
00:24:35,733 --> 00:24:37,783
- And I really appreciate it, Joy.
- Not done yet.

447
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,659
But after the last few days,
I've realized something.

448
00:24:40,739 --> 00:24:42,764
You're not just dumb,
you're broken.

449
00:24:43,154 --> 00:24:45,519
Like a daddy long-legs
after the kids pull his legs off.

450
00:24:45,599 --> 00:24:48,691
It's just a little, vibrating ball
that can't do nothing for itself.

451
00:24:48,771 --> 00:24:49,790
That's you.

452
00:24:49,941 --> 00:24:51,715
- I'm a spider ball?
- Yeah.

453
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:53,430
And you're a burden to your brother.

454
00:24:53,545 --> 00:24:55,021
Now I could babysit you for 2 years,

455
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:57,624
but when Earl gets out of prison,
you wouldn't be any better.

456
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,058
And you don't want to be an albacore
around your brother's neck, do you?

457
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:03,635
Is this because I peed on the kids?

458
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:06,134
It was the middle of the night.
I took a wrong turn.

459
00:25:06,214 --> 00:25:07,874
It's because of a lot of things, Randy.

460
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:09,057
Like...

461
00:25:09,531 --> 00:25:11,921
that dumb look
you got on your face all the time.

462
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:14,123
Or the fact that...

463
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,406
you think there's a left sock
and a right sock.

464
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:19,144
But don't you worry.

465
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,016
We're going to work everything out...

466
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,765
starting with this late-night talking.

467
00:25:26,573 --> 00:25:29,573
You can't breathe because of
your deviated septum, can you?

468
00:25:38,985 --> 00:25:40,055
I saw that on MASH.

469
00:25:40,839 --> 00:25:41,912
Night.

470
00:25:45,953 --> 00:25:47,752
<i>Since it was my first time in the cage,</i>

471
00:25:48,028 --> 00:25:50,543
<i>I got out before Glen, who,
from what I heard,</i>

472
00:25:50,631 --> 00:25:52,631
<i>seemed to spend more time
in there than his cell.</i>

473
00:25:53,562 --> 00:25:56,113
<i>To survive in prison,
I needed to stay invisible.</i>

474
00:25:56,428 --> 00:25:58,315
<i>But I also needed to get Glen a shiv.</i>

475
00:25:59,229 --> 00:26:01,283
<i>I was familiar with
the different types of shivs.</i>

476
00:26:01,623 --> 00:26:03,296
<i>There was the sharpened toothbrush,</i>

477
00:26:03,757 --> 00:26:05,031
<i>the razor comb...</i>

478
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,542
<i>There was
the Tighty-Whitey-Mighty-Fighty,</i>

479
00:26:07,642 --> 00:26:09,101
<i>somehow made out of underwear...</i>

480
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:11,015
<i>There was even one
made out of soap.</i>

481
00:26:11,385 --> 00:26:13,275
<i>But the one made out of soap
had its downside.</i>

482
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:23,820
<i>I decided I was gonna make Glen's
with an arm from a pair of glasses.</i>

483
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,966
<i>I was going to call it
"The Peeper Reaper".</i>

484
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:27,116
How about you?

485
00:26:27,417 --> 00:26:30,417
Would you hate Martin Luther King more
if he'd been Indian?

486
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:33,765
Okay, yeah. I'd hate him more
if he'd been Indian.

487
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:36,665
Unless he was Cherokee.

488
00:26:37,164 --> 00:26:39,642
A Cherokee once saved
my black grandpa from drowning.

489
00:26:43,914 --> 00:26:45,783
<i>I was relieved when,
a couple days later,</i>

490
00:26:45,863 --> 00:26:47,247
<i>Glen got out of the hot box.</i>

491
00:26:47,526 --> 00:26:49,631
<i>Mostly cause I wanted him
out of my life.</i>

492
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,696
<i>But also because, when you hide
a shiv in your pants for two days,</i>

493
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,531
<i>you can't help but have a few mishaps.</i>

494
00:26:54,707 --> 00:26:55,814
You got it?

495
00:27:01,347 --> 00:27:02,680
Nice.

496
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:05,536
Thanks.
I made it out of a pair of glasses.

497
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:07,219
Sharpened it on the asphalt,

498
00:27:07,333 --> 00:27:09,542
then I wrapped one of my socks
around it for a handle.

499
00:27:09,622 --> 00:27:11,484
You could stab all day
and not get a blister.

500
00:27:11,612 --> 00:27:15,269
<i>I hoped Karma would understand. I had
no choice but to give Glen that shiv.</i>

501
00:27:18,954 --> 00:27:20,028
<i>Lockdown!</i>

502
00:27:21,331 --> 00:27:22,463
<i>She didn't.</i>

503
00:27:24,864 --> 00:27:27,442
<i>After Glen stabbed me,
I realized two things...</i>

504
00:27:28,276 --> 00:27:29,858
<i>UntiI I did my list item right,</i>

505
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:32,436
<i>Karma wasn't going
to let me be invisible...</i>

506
00:27:32,741 --> 00:27:34,527
<i>and prison health care sucks.</i>

507
00:27:34,804 --> 00:27:35,983
Okay, you're done.

508
00:27:36,283 --> 00:27:40,552
There may be some shiv left in the bone,
if your arm turns black, tell a guard.

509
00:27:40,690 --> 00:27:41,974
That was quite a shiv.

510
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,088
Thank you.

511
00:27:47,250 --> 00:27:49,276
Wow, that Glen's got the worst luck.

512
00:27:50,661 --> 00:27:51,693
Excuse me?

513
00:27:52,219 --> 00:27:53,789
Every year when he's up for parole,

514
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:56,367
somebody pisses him off and
he breaks one of the big seven.

515
00:27:56,447 --> 00:27:57,491
The big seven?

516
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:00,098
Things that keep you
from getting out:

517
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,123
Stabbing, burning,
biting, strangling,

518
00:28:02,203 --> 00:28:04,681
eye gouging, scalping
and taking a poop in the urinal.

519
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,472
Wait, so he messes up
right before parole every time?

520
00:28:10,504 --> 00:28:11,776
Why would he do that?

521
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:14,033
You know what I figured out
about prison?

522
00:28:14,113 --> 00:28:17,463
There are a lot of guys in here
without clearly thought-out plans.

523
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,786
<i>Glen didn't want to get out of prison,</i>

524
00:28:19,932 --> 00:28:21,265
<i>and I wanted to know why.</i>

525
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,643
<i>And finally, after hours of wandering,</i>

526
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:26,234
<i>a fat guy walked by the hot box
so I could ask.</i>

527
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:27,811
Hey, Glen. You got a minute?

528
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:29,960
What the hell do you want?!

529
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,029
Look, I'm not gonna beat
around the bush, Glen.

530
00:28:32,109 --> 00:28:34,260
I think you've been blowing
your parole on purpose,

531
00:28:34,366 --> 00:28:35,743
and I want to know why.

532
00:28:44,736 --> 00:28:46,962
Look, just hear me out
before you kill me.

533
00:28:47,131 --> 00:28:48,378
<i>So I took the plunge and</i>

534
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,756
<i>did what I should have done
the first time I saw Glen...</i>

535
00:28:50,836 --> 00:28:52,466
<i>I told him all about my list, and</i>

536
00:28:52,553 --> 00:28:53,603
<i>how he was on it.</i>

537
00:28:53,685 --> 00:28:55,771
<i>And how, if I was going
to be right with Karma,</i>

538
00:28:56,092 --> 00:28:59,242
<i>I had to do something better than
a shiv to make it up to him.</i>

539
00:28:59,915 --> 00:29:02,565
You really got a list of
bad things you make up for?

540
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,475
I even helped a whole town
of circus freaks.

541
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:08,891
Damn it. I'm not supposed
to call them "freaks".

542
00:29:09,221 --> 00:29:10,491
"Irregular-Americans."

543
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,837
I don't give a sand-covered
cat's crap if you know.

544
00:29:17,383 --> 00:29:19,119
- I'm blowing parole.
- Why?

545
00:29:20,515 --> 00:29:22,905
Because life on the outside
ain't no good for me no more.

546
00:29:27,369 --> 00:29:29,390
<i>Glen told me how
when he first got into juvie</i>

547
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,067
<i>he was so worried about surviving,</i>

548
00:29:31,268 --> 00:29:32,715
<i>he changed the way he was and</i>

549
00:29:32,852 --> 00:29:35,078
<i>did things to make himself
look as tough as he could.</i>

550
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:38,814
<i>Like getting tattoos before
he even knew what cuss words were.</i>

551
00:29:42,586 --> 00:29:44,236
<i>And after years of changing himself,</i>

552
00:29:44,496 --> 00:29:46,372
<i>he was so believable as a badass,</i>

553
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:48,573
<i>it's how people on the outside
saw him, too.</i>

554
00:29:52,006 --> 00:29:53,025
Can I help you?

555
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:55,536
I'm looking for a job.

556
00:29:55,812 --> 00:29:57,988
Please don't hurt me.
I don't want to die.

557
00:29:58,177 --> 00:30:00,085
My pin number's 8-4-3-2.

558
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:07,666
<i>Even when he was doing something good</i>

559
00:30:07,775 --> 00:30:09,552
<i>like going back to the liquor store</i>

560
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,800
<i>to tell them how they'd given him
too much change,</i>

561
00:30:11,942 --> 00:30:13,869
<i>people still judged him
on how he looked.</i>

562
00:30:21,106 --> 00:30:23,306
<i>It didn't take long before
a badass criminal</i>

563
00:30:23,429 --> 00:30:25,283
<i>was the only way Glen saw himself.</i>

564
00:30:25,629 --> 00:30:26,849
<i>So that's how he acted.</i>

565
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:36,877
<i>Every time he got out,</i>

566
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,516
<i>he'd take one look at himself
and do the same thing.</i>

567
00:30:40,198 --> 00:30:42,365
<i>Again, and again, and again.</i>

568
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:45,396
<i>Until he decided
to stop wasting everyone's time</i>

569
00:30:45,479 --> 00:30:46,518
<i>and just stay in prison.</i>

570
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,569
My God, Glen, I feel terrible.

571
00:30:49,183 --> 00:30:50,686
All this stuff is my fault.

572
00:30:50,855 --> 00:30:52,491
It's my fault you got locked up, and

573
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:54,566
it's my fault you're afraid to get out.

574
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:56,347
I'm afraid of no man!

575
00:30:57,758 --> 00:30:59,972
Afraid to get out.
I said afraid to get out.

576
00:31:00,858 --> 00:31:02,470
Oh, yeah, well, that's true.

577
00:31:03,263 --> 00:31:06,353
<i>The next day Glen got out of the box,
and I had a chance to tell him</i>

578
00:31:06,456 --> 00:31:09,039
<i>I wanted to do something to help him
live on the outside again.</i>

579
00:31:09,121 --> 00:31:11,732
I want to do something
to help you live on the outside again.

580
00:31:11,814 --> 00:31:12,934
That'd be cool.

581
00:31:13,502 --> 00:31:14,935
Something big. I mean...

582
00:31:15,195 --> 00:31:16,603
I practically took your life.

583
00:31:17,665 --> 00:31:19,374
I always wanted to go to Mars.

584
00:31:21,163 --> 00:31:22,693
Smaller, something smaller.

585
00:31:23,517 --> 00:31:24,679
I'm out of stamps.

586
00:31:25,525 --> 00:31:27,630
Okay, something between stamps and Mars.

587
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:29,346
Something important to you.

588
00:31:29,767 --> 00:31:33,095
Maybe something you cared about
before you became a criminal.

589
00:31:33,221 --> 00:31:34,273
I know.

590
00:31:34,997 --> 00:31:36,300
My Camden Scout badges.

591
00:31:36,721 --> 00:31:38,982
Camden Scout badges?
How's that going to help you?

592
00:31:39,693 --> 00:31:40,978
If I hadn't gone to juvie,

593
00:31:41,074 --> 00:31:43,301
I would have been
the first kid in Camden to get a...

594
00:31:43,865 --> 00:31:44,890
an honor sash.

595
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:46,933
I was only two badges away.

596
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,221
God, I miss being a Camden Scout.

597
00:31:49,962 --> 00:31:52,350
My neckerchief fluttering
in the morning breeze.

598
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:54,314
Sneaking upstairs during meetings

599
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:56,409
to smell
the scoutmaster's daughter's shoes.

600
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,173
The knots, Earl.

601
00:32:00,865 --> 00:32:02,127
The knots I could tie.

602
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:06,368
<i>It was the second time
Glen asked me to do something for him.</i>

603
00:32:06,595 --> 00:32:08,153
<i>But from the look in his eyes,</i>

604
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,702
<i>I knew it was the first time
I was going to do it right.</i>

605
00:32:11,383 --> 00:32:13,337
All right, I'm in.
Where do we start?

606
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:15,586
I need my archeology badge.

607
00:32:17,904 --> 00:32:19,453
We could dig in the west yard.

608
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:22,346
Just have talk to those guys over there.
They control it.

609
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:23,658
The albinos?

610
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:26,425
And I need my natural science badge.

611
00:32:26,652 --> 00:32:27,800
That's bug collecting.

612
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:29,754
That should be easy.
The barracks are...

613
00:32:29,849 --> 00:32:31,230
most of them are infested.

614
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,898
Just got to make deals
with the gangs that control them.

615
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:36,832
<i>Looking around that yard,
I knew I was in trouble.</i>

616
00:32:36,912 --> 00:32:39,814
<i>Not only was I going
to lose my last bit of invisibility,</i>

617
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,315
<i>I was going to have to make deals with
the most dangerous people in the place.</i>

618
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,578
<i>If Karma was planning on killing me,
I was hoping she'd so it quick.</i>

619
00:32:52,124 --> 00:32:54,721
<i>I was about to go against
everything Sonny had taught me.</i>

620
00:32:54,858 --> 00:32:57,841
<i>Owing favors would make you
the most visible you could become,</i>

621
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,774
<i>And I was about to owe a lot of them.</i>

622
00:32:59,899 --> 00:33:02,397
- Excuse me.
- What do you want, Hawaiian Tropics?

623
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,178
I'm helping a guy get his archeology
badge for Camden Scouts.

624
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,688
Nerd.

625
00:33:07,928 --> 00:33:10,949
Yeah, anyway,
we need someplace to dig,

626
00:33:11,263 --> 00:33:12,759
and I hear this is the best spot.

627
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:14,600
So I guess what I'm saying is...

628
00:33:16,477 --> 00:33:17,570
I need a favor.

629
00:33:18,164 --> 00:33:20,163
We want umbrellas.

630
00:33:20,512 --> 00:33:21,545
Eight of them.

631
00:33:24,663 --> 00:33:27,293
<i>While I was putting my faith
in Karma to keep me safe,</i>

632
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,521
<i>Joy was putting her faith
in a different power, tough love.</i>

633
00:33:30,616 --> 00:33:32,352
He's gotta learn to think on his own,

634
00:33:32,466 --> 00:33:33,672
make his own choices.

635
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,759
Tough love, Darnell, tough love.

636
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:47,604
<i>Joy had a lot of faults,</i>

637
00:33:47,755 --> 00:33:49,723
<i>but she did have
a natural gift for teaching.</i>

638
00:33:55,035 --> 00:33:57,152
<i>And while Randy may have been
a slow learner,</i>

639
00:33:57,282 --> 00:33:58,403
<i>Joy kept after him...</i>

640
00:33:58,868 --> 00:34:01,537
<i>teaching him things
he should have learned a long time ago,</i>

641
00:34:01,688 --> 00:34:04,009
<i>like the clothes you find
in the gutter might be free,</i>

642
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:06,362
<i>but, well, they're probably not
disease free.</i>

643
00:34:09,031 --> 00:34:11,885
<i>Or how to make his brain and his belly
communicate better.</i>

644
00:34:12,036 --> 00:34:13,239
I'll have the chicken.

645
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,094
No, wait...

646
00:34:15,422 --> 00:34:16,447
the crab claws.

647
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:20,404
How's the tuna salad?

648
00:34:20,485 --> 00:34:22,056
Not as good as the chicken salad,

649
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:25,192
but better than getting smacked
in the neck with a big-ass rubber band.

650
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:29,502
Choose, dummy!

651
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:31,503
God... think for yourself.

652
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,294
Take the crab claws.

653
00:34:34,557 --> 00:34:36,093
I'll have what the puppet's having.

654
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:41,728
<i>And eventually
all that pain turned into some gain.</i>

655
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:45,650
You stopped!

656
00:34:46,028 --> 00:34:48,213
Did you do that on purpose
or on accident?

657
00:34:48,293 --> 00:34:49,530
Don't you lie to me.

658
00:34:49,624 --> 00:34:50,635
On purpose.

659
00:34:50,744 --> 00:34:52,695
My brain told my feet to stop
and they did.

660
00:34:53,105 --> 00:34:55,436
My brain never been smarter
than my feet before.

661
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,074
I'm proud of you, Randy.

662
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,836
Now if we can stop walking around
with your brother's shirt

663
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:02,445
like a giant-headed, hillbilly Linus,
you'll be fixed.

664
00:35:04,457 --> 00:35:05,987
<i>I was having success, too.</i>

665
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:09,128
<i>Although I knew every deal I made
was another favor I owed.</i>

666
00:35:09,271 --> 00:35:10,926
I need some spoons to dig with.

667
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:13,219
- Escape?
- Archeology.

668
00:35:13,976 --> 00:35:15,358
I don't know that word.

669
00:35:15,668 --> 00:35:17,513
But you know spoons though, right?

670
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:21,615
Okay, you got it, but I need a favor.

671
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:24,914
I want you to get everyone out
of this prison for an entire day

672
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:26,712
so I can have this place to myself.

673
00:35:29,616 --> 00:35:31,030
Okay, I'll work on that.

674
00:35:31,885 --> 00:35:33,591
<i>And, with every favor I asked,</i>

675
00:35:33,671 --> 00:35:35,417
<i>I felt a little less safe.</i>

676
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,887
I'm going to need
some brushes to clean off

677
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:40,281
whatever we find
when we dig for archeology.

678
00:35:41,485 --> 00:35:42,523
You got it.

679
00:35:42,737 --> 00:35:45,238
But I'm going to need you
to take care of my dog Simon.

680
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:53,188
And if you lose him,

681
00:35:53,298 --> 00:35:54,418
I'll kill you.

682
00:35:56,811 --> 00:35:58,532
<i>And every favor I asked meant</i>

683
00:35:58,641 --> 00:36:00,747
<i>another scary prisoner knew I existed.</i>

684
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:03,689
So far, we've already collected
lice and hookworms.

685
00:36:04,052 --> 00:36:05,960
Word on the yard is, you have maggots.

686
00:36:06,318 --> 00:36:08,924
Yeah, but they're cleaning
the dead flesh out of my back wound.

687
00:36:09,244 --> 00:36:10,337
So you can take 'em,

688
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:13,023
but then you got to clean
the dead flesh out of my back wound.

689
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:18,390
<i>Pretty soon we had everything we need.</i>

690
00:36:18,653 --> 00:36:20,183
<i>For his archeology badge,</i>

691
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:22,856
<i>we stumbled on the spot
where, in the old days,</i>

692
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,988
<i>the guards played a game they called
"kick the prisoner in the face. "</i>

693
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,113
Save the molars.

694
00:36:27,373 --> 00:36:29,669
We could use them to make dice.

695
00:36:32,616 --> 00:36:34,092
<i>For his natural science badge,</i>

696
00:36:34,201 --> 00:36:36,470
<i>we'd collect lice,
hookworms and maggots.</i>

697
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,204
<i>All we needed now were some roaches.</i>

698
00:36:40,597 --> 00:36:41,758
Okay, hit it.

699
00:36:43,395 --> 00:36:44,502
Okay, light's on.

700
00:36:51,171 --> 00:36:53,344
<i>And the thing
I thought would be the hardest</i>

701
00:36:53,473 --> 00:36:55,093
<i>turned out to be the easiest.</i>

702
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:58,601
Excuse me.

703
00:37:00,195 --> 00:37:01,262
For those of you

704
00:37:01,343 --> 00:37:03,344
who don't know me yet

705
00:37:03,536 --> 00:37:05,422
I'm helping a guy get some badges.

706
00:37:05,995 --> 00:37:08,353
Does anyone here
happen to be a scoutmaster?

707
00:37:14,422 --> 00:37:17,394
<i>And just like that,
Glen got his last two badges</i>

708
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:19,362
<i>and was finally awarded his honor sash.</i>

709
00:37:20,767 --> 00:37:23,917
<i>And when the parole board heard
hat a change he'd made in himself,</i>

710
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:25,742
<i>they finally gave him his parole.</i>

711
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:36,595
<i>And Glen was happy to be out.</i>

712
00:37:36,738 --> 00:37:39,102
<i>But while people
were no longer afraid of him,</i>

713
00:37:39,252 --> 00:37:41,065
<i>they still judged him
by the way he looked.</i>

714
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:42,977
Check out this dude
in the scout uniform.

715
00:37:43,288 --> 00:37:44,546
Be prepared...

716
00:37:44,696 --> 00:37:46,186
to never get laid.

717
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:51,042
<i>Glen thought about going back
to his old stealing ways...</i>

718
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:56,220
<i>but for the first time,</i>

719
00:37:56,302 --> 00:37:58,779
<i>the way other people saw him
didn't matter as much.</i>

720
00:37:59,635 --> 00:38:01,562
<i>What mattered was how he saw himself.</i>

721
00:38:07,601 --> 00:38:11,143
<i>Prison debts are bad, so it was nice
knowing I had paid mine to Glen.</i>

722
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,511
<i>It would have been nicer</i>

723
00:38:12,607 --> 00:38:15,331
<i>if there weren't a ton of other convicts
I owed favors to now.</i>

724
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:16,753
Yeah, I know, I know.

725
00:38:16,855 --> 00:38:18,809
I got to get everybody out
of here for a day.

726
00:38:19,219 --> 00:38:22,199
I'm trying to organize
a huge field trip to the Aquarium.

727
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:23,695
They haven't called me back.

728
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:25,032
You got rid of Glen.

729
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:28,289
That's a start, right?
One guy down, 1,200 to go?

730
00:38:28,504 --> 00:38:29,653
Don't worry about it.

731
00:38:29,748 --> 00:38:32,167
That Glen was causing
all those stupid lockdowns.

732
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:34,806
Making me crazier than my mom
before I chopped her up.

733
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:36,247
Anyway...

734
00:38:36,368 --> 00:38:37,942
thanks for getting him out of here.

735
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:39,441
You don't owe me anything.

736
00:38:44,696 --> 00:38:46,686
Man, thanks for the peace and quiet.

737
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:48,751
You don't have to keep
taking care of Simon.

738
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,967
We're square.

739
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:53,608
Aren't you going to give him back to me?

740
00:38:54,304 --> 00:38:55,389
Oh, right.

741
00:39:01,295 --> 00:39:04,438
You're so big.
What's that man been feeding you?

742
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:15,896
<i>The next two years
were going to be hard,</i>

743
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:19,336
<i>but now I knew I couldn't survive them
by doing the same thing Glen had...</i>

744
00:39:19,433 --> 00:39:21,989
<i>letting prison turn me
into someone I wouldn't recognize.</i>

745
00:39:22,881 --> 00:39:25,054
<i>I realized that
no matter how scared I get,</i>

746
00:39:25,150 --> 00:39:26,915
<i>if I'm going to survive in prison</i>

747
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:28,542
<i>I have to do it as myself.</i>

748
00:39:28,835 --> 00:39:33,414
<i>Cause my name isn't
Inmate number 28301-016.</i>

749
00:39:33,523 --> 00:39:35,040
<i>My name is Earl.</i>
