1
00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:07,471
<i>In prison, there's no day
more special than conjugal day.</i>

2
00:00:10,481 --> 00:00:14,318
<i>Which looks better,
throat scar or no throat scar?</i>

3
00:00:14,828 --> 00:00:17,792
<i>Twice a month, the guys in my barracks
get to have sex with a woman,</i>

4
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:21,070
<i>sometimes with their wives,
sometimes with their girlfriends...</i>

5
00:00:22,378 --> 00:00:25,012
<i>and sometimes with women
they were meeting for the first time,</i>

6
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:26,449
<i>known as "letter writers."</i>

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,716
<i>Special ladies who actually
seek out incarcerated boyfriends.</i>

8
00:00:29,842 --> 00:00:31,453
You look different from your picture.

9
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:33,087
You killed your father.

10
00:00:33,998 --> 00:00:34,930
Fair enough.

11
00:00:36,431 --> 00:00:38,316
<i>Yep, conjugal day was great...</i>

12
00:00:38,639 --> 00:00:41,705
<i>unless you bit off a guy's earlobe
and got thrown in the hot box,</i>

13
00:00:41,826 --> 00:00:43,317
<i>- like Frank.
- Earl, buddy,</i>

14
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:44,762
it's good to see you.
Listen, listen.

15
00:00:44,898 --> 00:00:46,132
You got to go find my girl Billie.

16
00:00:46,268 --> 00:00:48,851
Just tell her that I'm not
blowing her off and that I love her

17
00:00:48,986 --> 00:00:52,090
and that she's the best thing
that's ever happened to me, Earl.

18
00:00:52,405 --> 00:00:54,323
She's, she's my angel.

19
00:00:56,186 --> 00:00:59,353
- Your naked angel.
- Yeah.

20
00:01:00,485 --> 00:01:02,903
With wings tattooed
on her most private angel area.

21
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:04,961
Yeah, those wings cost me a fortune.

22
00:01:05,097 --> 00:01:07,901
Plus, it was awkward.
Her brother was the tattoo artist.

23
00:01:08,037 --> 00:01:11,462
Ah, that explains
the "Love your brother".

24
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:14,092
I thought she was just trying
to make the world a better place.

25
00:01:15,956 --> 00:01:19,593
<i>Back at home, Joy was in her 8th month
of surrogating her sister's baby,</i>

26
00:01:19,785 --> 00:01:22,622
<i>and it was having a frustrating
impact on her everyday life.</i>

27
00:01:24,337 --> 00:01:25,683
Your feet must hurt.

28
00:01:25,816 --> 00:01:27,061
They're so swollen.

29
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:30,452
They look like hungry biscuits
trying to swallow up your flip-flops.

30
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:32,393
Yeah, well,
I'm retaining so much water,

31
00:01:32,518 --> 00:01:35,343
I'm afraid you're gonna try to swim
across me to get your green card!

32
00:01:35,816 --> 00:01:37,953
That wasn't a very motherly exchange.

33
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:40,900
Yeah, well, being pregnant
ain't a very motherly experience.

34
00:01:41,157 --> 00:01:43,660
Feels like this little monster's
got my liver in a headlock.

35
00:01:45,778 --> 00:01:46,542
Darnell...

36
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:48,640
I just messed my pants.

37
00:01:48,797 --> 00:01:49,391
Pardon?

38
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:50,750
I just messed my pants.

39
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:51,880
Walk behind me.

40
00:01:52,206 --> 00:01:53,381
Walk behind me.

41
00:01:55,246 --> 00:01:57,411
Go get me some towels
and some new bottoms.

42
00:01:59,927 --> 00:02:01,950
Hola. Miras lo que viene?

43
00:02:03,247 --> 00:02:05,223
Occupied!
Occupied-o!

44
00:02:11,208 --> 00:02:13,650
- Your wife pooped herself.
- Indeed.

45
00:02:16,857 --> 00:02:22,351
"And when you hear the buzzer sound,
that is your 10-minute warning to finish."

46
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:28,570
"Please hose down all items
you have forn-I-cated on."

47
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:31,200
Randy, I'm only here
to talk to her, for Frank.

48
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:32,840
Hose it down anyway.

49
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:34,801
Sometimes you spit when you talk.

50
00:02:38,956 --> 00:02:39,652
Hey.

51
00:02:39,895 --> 00:02:42,583
Oh, god, not again.

52
00:02:42,715 --> 00:02:44,893
I told Frank no more threesomes.

53
00:02:45,086 --> 00:02:45,943
No offense.

54
00:02:46,066 --> 00:02:47,762
I'm just afraid he'll finish too quick,

55
00:02:47,887 --> 00:02:50,203
and I'll be stuck
awkwardly doing a stranger.

56
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:52,991
<i>I could see why Frank
was so crazy about Billie.</i>

57
00:02:53,218 --> 00:02:56,200
<i>He said he knew she was the one
the first moment he laid eyes on her.</i>

58
00:02:59,398 --> 00:03:01,931
<i>And when Frank opened up to her,
she actually listened.</i>

59
00:03:02,066 --> 00:03:03,591
<i>He never had a girl like that before.</i>

60
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,023
You know, I don't believe
in heaven and hell.

61
00:03:06,147 --> 00:03:08,140
I think death is more
like an after-party

62
00:03:08,268 --> 00:03:11,532
where everyone goes to the same club
and drinks some beers,

63
00:03:11,777 --> 00:03:14,363
- smoke a little something-something.
- Like the Peach Pit After Dark.

64
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,373
Totally.

65
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:17,840
I'm Earl Hickey, a friend of Frank's.

66
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:19,683
He got thrown in the hot box, but

67
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:21,560
he wanted me to tell you
that he loves you

68
00:03:22,125 --> 00:03:24,012
and that you're his number one angel,

69
00:03:24,227 --> 00:03:25,501
which is saying a lot 'cause

70
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:27,390
there's quite a few guys
named "Angel" in here.

71
00:03:27,526 --> 00:03:29,251
He got thrown in the hot box?

72
00:03:29,437 --> 00:03:31,092
Today of all days?

73
00:03:32,078 --> 00:03:33,672
That son of a bitch.

74
00:03:33,808 --> 00:03:36,233
- He doesn't love me.
- Come on. He loves you.

75
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:38,023
He talks about you all the time.

76
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:41,433
He's been faithful for
at least seven years.

77
00:03:41,568 --> 00:03:43,040
Don't think he hasn't
been tempted in here.

78
00:03:43,178 --> 00:03:45,152
One of those Angels
is a pretty smooth talker.

79
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,493
Plus, he bought you
that fancy wing tattoo.

80
00:03:47,628 --> 00:03:49,540
If that doesn't say "love,"
nothing does.

81
00:03:49,935 --> 00:03:51,701
Your brother is an artist,
by the way.

82
00:03:53,955 --> 00:03:55,582
You saw my wings?

83
00:03:55,796 --> 00:03:56,410
No.

84
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:59,420
That jackass showed you
my naked picture?

85
00:03:59,548 --> 00:04:03,773
No, uh, Frank just, he has a way
of painting pictures with words.

86
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:07,663
I only felt like I saw it 'cause
he described it in such detail.

87
00:04:08,938 --> 00:04:12,101
He described my vagina in detail.

88
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:16,273
Wich answer will make you
feel less violated?

89
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:17,690
That's it.

90
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:19,690
I can't do this anymore.

91
00:04:19,908 --> 00:04:21,082
Tell Frank that we're done.

92
00:04:21,216 --> 00:04:22,163
It's over.

93
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:25,671
No, no, no, look, you got
to give him a second chance.

94
00:04:25,798 --> 00:04:27,261
I used to do stupid things like Frank,

95
00:04:27,387 --> 00:04:30,542
then life gave me a second chance,
and I started doing good things.

96
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:32,232
People can change.

97
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:34,822
You're right, Earl,
people can change,

98
00:04:34,947 --> 00:04:37,090
starting with me.
I'm done with Frank.

99
00:04:37,215 --> 00:04:38,702
And you can tell that jackass

100
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:41,233
that I'm taking the promise ring out
when I get home.

101
00:04:45,195 --> 00:04:48,212
"I see your lady guest has exited."

102
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:50,631
"Please pull up your pants--
half circle--

103
00:04:50,767 --> 00:04:54,911
"if they are not already up--
half circle-- and follow me."

104
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:59,203
<i>Since the prison
confiscated my old list,</i>

105
00:04:59,327 --> 00:05:00,602
<i>I had to make a new one.</i>

106
00:05:00,737 --> 00:05:03,321
<i>And that day I added
"Made Frank's girl dump him."</i>

107
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:07,812
<i>Frank was the closest thing I had
to a friend in prison and</i>

108
00:05:07,938 --> 00:05:10,203
<i>I owed it to him to tell him
the truth right away,</i>

109
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:11,342
<i>while he couldn't hurt me.</i>

110
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:14,440
<i>But he was hurting too much on
the inside to even consider hurting me.</i>

111
00:05:14,567 --> 00:05:17,111
I added it to my list if that helps.

112
00:05:17,248 --> 00:05:18,833
Billie was my whole life.

113
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,112
Now my life is dead.

114
00:05:21,647 --> 00:05:23,193
I-I got-got a dead life.

115
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:26,801
The list doesn't always mean as much
to other people as it

116
00:05:26,925 --> 00:05:28,062
does to me.

117
00:05:33,587 --> 00:05:35,790
<i>That night,
Joy was having trouble, too.</i>

118
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:38,310
<i>Being blackmailed by Catalina
wasn't sitting well with her.</i>

119
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:41,790
Oh, Baby, all your wiggling
made Mr. Turtle throw up a little.

120
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:43,993
How am I gonna get that
picture back from Catalina?

121
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:45,692
I mean, I can't blackmail her.

122
00:05:45,968 --> 00:05:48,600
Everything she should be
embarrassed about people already know.

123
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:51,423
She's a stripper, she's a maid,
she's a foreigner.

124
00:05:53,075 --> 00:05:54,592
I'm just gonna have to kill her.

125
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:56,000
You can't kill that woman.

126
00:05:56,136 --> 00:05:57,110
Oh, yes, I can.

127
00:05:57,247 --> 00:05:59,713
A poison cookie, just like I tried
with Earl a couple years ago.

128
00:05:59,848 --> 00:06:02,411
I mean, I still know the recipe.
It's just sugar, eggs and poison.

129
00:06:02,535 --> 00:06:04,361
Why don't you just try
being nice to her?

130
00:06:04,496 --> 00:06:06,100
People like it
when you're nice to them.

131
00:06:06,225 --> 00:06:09,472
Remember 5 years ago at the pet store
when you made that guy smile?

132
00:06:11,156 --> 00:06:11,951
Fine.

133
00:06:14,386 --> 00:06:17,183
Dear Lord, please give me the strength
to be nice to somebody

134
00:06:17,316 --> 00:06:19,993
who I hate so much I wish you would
strike her down with a lightning bolt

135
00:06:20,128 --> 00:06:22,852
and fry her into one those little
mexican cinnamon sticks.

136
00:06:23,056 --> 00:06:24,243
They're called churros.

137
00:06:25,146 --> 00:06:28,092
Yeah, churros. Amen.

138
00:06:30,397 --> 00:06:33,843
<i>I hoped Frank would be feeling better
by the time he got out of the hot box,</i>

139
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:35,183
<i>but he wasn't.</i>

140
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,962
<i>In fact, he wasn't feeling much at all.</i>

141
00:06:37,097 --> 00:06:38,512
What happened to your shoes?

142
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:40,960
Oh, I guess someone took 'em.

143
00:06:41,495 --> 00:06:44,300
<i>Frank had done the one thing
you don't want to do in prison:</i>

144
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:45,676
<i>he had given up.</i>

145
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:48,055
<i>And that made him a target,</i>

146
00:06:49,186 --> 00:06:50,707
<i>the worst kind of target.</i>

147
00:06:52,849 --> 00:06:55,820
Frank, James is tattooing
his name on your ass.

148
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:59,673
<i>That's when I knew I had to make
Frank's problem my priority.</i>

149
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,562
We're gonna find you
a new girlfriend.

150
00:07:01,697 --> 00:07:03,560
Hey, man,
what do you think this means?

151
00:07:04,235 --> 00:07:07,402
<i>There were two choices for getting
Frank a new girlfriend in prison:</i>

152
00:07:07,587 --> 00:07:09,091
<i>Female prison guards...</i>

153
00:07:10,536 --> 00:07:12,650
<i>Okay, there was really
only one choice.</i>

154
00:07:12,885 --> 00:07:15,761
<i>The letter-writing women
who were on the prowl for inmates.</i>

155
00:07:15,897 --> 00:07:18,081
<i>Apparently, these women
use some web site called</i>

156
00:07:18,206 --> 00:07:20,722
<i>"convict match" to find
the prisoner of their dreams.</i>

157
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,051
<i>All we had to do was
make a video of Frank and</i>

158
00:07:23,187 --> 00:07:25,952
<i>have Randy put it into the web site
using a magic cord.</i>

159
00:07:26,085 --> 00:07:27,993
- Say "cheese."
- You know, I don't want to do this.

160
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:30,661
Besides, no one's going to love me
the way Billie did.

161
00:07:30,796 --> 00:07:31,850
Sure they will.

162
00:07:31,978 --> 00:07:32,572
Come on, Frank.

163
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,582
This is easy.

164
00:07:33,715 --> 00:07:37,562
The bar's set so low, even that prisoner
that's just a torso got a date.

165
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:39,393
Oh, good for pillow.

166
00:07:39,516 --> 00:07:40,941
Well, then why aren't you doing it?

167
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:44,791
<i>I had to admit, it did get
lonely on the inside,</i>

168
00:07:45,626 --> 00:07:48,800
<i>and having a little female
companionship sounded pretty nice.</i>

169
00:07:50,716 --> 00:07:53,653
My name is Earl, and, uh,
I didn't murder anybody.

170
00:07:53,785 --> 00:07:56,272
I have $40 in my prison
canteen account.

171
00:07:56,405 --> 00:07:58,281
I like taking long
walks out in the yard.

172
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,760
I could bench-press my mom,
and she's fat.

173
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:04,332
I've never been in love,
but I've been married twice.

174
00:08:04,465 --> 00:08:08,520
I love kids, but that's not
what got me in here.

175
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:12,691
I'm not saying anyone's ever actually
confused me with Tom Selleck,

176
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:15,460
but I do get a lot of
"Hey, Magnum".

177
00:08:16,816 --> 00:08:20,130
<i>Joy was working to solve her problem
by being nice to someone she hated.</i>

178
00:08:20,266 --> 00:08:21,292
Hey, Catalina.

179
00:08:21,546 --> 00:08:22,852
Brought you a present.

180
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:27,202
It's a donkey for you,
just because we're friends.

181
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:31,133
Now, the stick, the stick,
you're gonna have to earn.

182
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,731
Give me your cell phone
and it's yours.

183
00:08:33,858 --> 00:08:35,681
Then you can get all
the mexican candy inside

184
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,462
that your people like
to break their teeth on.

185
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:42,620
Actually, Joy, I'm gonna
keep my phone, the donkey...

186
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:45,910
and I would like the stick.

187
00:08:46,505 --> 00:08:48,470
That's not the deal, friend.

188
00:08:49,707 --> 00:08:51,732
Excuse me, would anybody
like to see Joy...?

189
00:08:51,868 --> 00:08:53,561
Take the stick!
Take it, take it, take it, take it!

190
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:54,402
Take the stick.

191
00:08:58,245 --> 00:08:59,931
I thought you had her, baby.

192
00:09:00,386 --> 00:09:02,393
I just got outsmarted by an illegal.

193
00:09:02,696 --> 00:09:04,782
I am so voting in '08!

194
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:10,280
<i>A few days later, me and Frank
found out we were convict matches</i>

195
00:09:10,406 --> 00:09:13,253
<i>for two ladies who wrote to us
and were coming to visit.</i>

196
00:09:13,456 --> 00:09:15,582
<i>Randy even hooked us up
with the conjugal apartment.</i>

197
00:09:15,716 --> 00:09:18,842
And I'm gonna give you guys
twice as much time.

198
00:09:19,218 --> 00:09:21,391
But if anyone asks,
just remember to say

199
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:24,251
you each had sex
with your own girl, then switched.

200
00:09:24,377 --> 00:09:25,941
Otherwise, I could get in trouble.

201
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,180
Are you Annie or Lucy?

202
00:09:33,276 --> 00:09:34,452
Lucy.

203
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:35,840
Hi, Frank.

204
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,772
Wow, you're even cuter
than in your video.

205
00:09:37,897 --> 00:09:40,653
Are you in for life? Because I'm looking
for a long-term relationship.

206
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:42,891
Oops, can you
excuse me for a minute?

207
00:09:43,026 --> 00:09:44,562
I got to pee when I'm nervous.

208
00:09:45,365 --> 00:09:47,241
That's disgusting.
You know, Billie never peed.

209
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:49,673
Frank, look around.
We're in prison.

210
00:09:49,808 --> 00:09:52,820
If that girl's biggest problem
is that she pees, you're in good shape.

211
00:09:53,128 --> 00:09:55,311
What you need to do
is lower your standards.

212
00:10:00,155 --> 00:10:00,991
Annie?

213
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:02,163
Hi, Earl.

214
00:10:04,366 --> 00:10:07,643
<i>After a few more potty breaks,
Frank and Lucy started hitting it off.

215
00:10:07,778 --> 00:10:09,640
Your arms are really strong.

216
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:10,370
Yeah.

217
00:10:10,385 --> 00:10:12,590
I wonder if my dad has strong arms?

218
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:15,392
If I meet him, I'm going
to hug him and never let go.

219
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:17,371
'Cause he's my daddy.

220
00:10:21,378 --> 00:10:23,121
Do you want to know
what got me about your video?

221
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,313
No, thank you.

222
00:10:25,996 --> 00:10:28,221
All right, we're going
to hit the bedroom.

223
00:10:32,056 --> 00:10:33,241
So, Annie...

224
00:10:35,497 --> 00:10:37,000
you've got a wiener, right?

225
00:10:37,465 --> 00:10:39,602
It doesn't function if that
makes you feel any better.

226
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:45,821
<i>Gentlemen, put your
hands together for Catalina!

227
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:48,051
<i>While I was trying to keep
Annie's hands off me,

228
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:51,042
<i>Joy was trying to get her hands
on Catalina's phone.

229
00:10:54,857 --> 00:10:58,150
El deleto la picturo.

230
00:10:59,096 --> 00:11:02,441
<i>Then she decided to steal herself
a new cell phone for all her trouble.

231
00:11:03,616 --> 00:11:07,141
<i>Me and Annie got to talking'cause,
well, we had no other choice.

232
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:08,891
<i>And it turned out, she...

233
00:11:09,026 --> 00:11:11,550
<i>that's what she said to call him...
was easy to talk to.

234
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:13,433
I didn't really commit the crime, but

235
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:16,430
I still feel like I deserve
to be here because of karma.

236
00:11:17,016 --> 00:11:18,281
I know it sounds confusing.

237
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,981
Heck, people have been calling me
confusing my whole life, but I'm not.

238
00:11:22,457 --> 00:11:24,560
That's why I'm going through
with this whole surgery.

239
00:11:25,657 --> 00:11:26,990
Hole surgery?

240
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,171
I'd think they'd have
a fancier name for it.

241
00:11:29,295 --> 00:11:30,001
They do.

242
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:31,680
It's called vaginoplasty.

243
00:11:37,515 --> 00:11:39,291
So we going to make out, or...?

244
00:11:40,315 --> 00:11:43,473
You know, Annie, if I was here
for 30 years or something,

245
00:11:43,605 --> 00:11:47,293
I might be able to justify it,
but I get out in two, so...

246
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,353
I get it.

247
00:11:52,495 --> 00:11:54,321
You know, the top half's
already done.

248
00:11:54,765 --> 00:11:56,120
You want a squeeze?

249
00:12:03,416 --> 00:12:04,913
Technology.

250
00:12:14,145 --> 00:12:16,231
Frank...
step away from the girl.

251
00:12:16,357 --> 00:12:17,211
I can't do that, Earl.

252
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:18,530
I need her to look
more like Billie, and

253
00:12:18,657 --> 00:12:21,000
- Billie has her bellybutton pierced.
- She's not Billie.

254
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:21,782
Not yet.

255
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:22,923
Let him do it.

256
00:12:23,106 --> 00:12:23,842
He's fixing me.

257
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:26,770
Look, we'll get Billie back, okay?

258
00:12:26,907 --> 00:12:27,952
The real Billie.

259
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:30,743
You really think
we can get her back?

260
00:12:30,957 --> 00:12:32,322
I think we're going to have to.

261
00:12:32,497 --> 00:12:34,371
Now you're talking, Earl.

262
00:12:34,966 --> 00:12:37,521
This probably isn't going to help
your abandonment issues, huh?

263
00:12:37,935 --> 00:12:39,951
<i>While I was trying
to solve Frank's problem,

264
00:12:40,086 --> 00:12:41,990
<i>Joy's problem
was starting up again.

265
00:12:43,385 --> 00:12:44,902
Oh, snap!

266
00:12:45,037 --> 00:12:47,203
<i>Joy thought she'd put
her mess behind her,

267
00:12:47,325 --> 00:12:48,551
<i>but she hadn't.

268
00:12:53,308 --> 00:12:54,073
What?

269
00:12:55,085 --> 00:12:56,740
I don't know who stole your phone.

270
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:59,982
Yes, I know what
"already downloaded jpeg" means.

271
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:03,481
Darnell, what's a jpeg?
What's downloading?

272
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,921
And why am I holding a picture of me
crapping my pants again?

273
00:13:06,048 --> 00:13:08,502
<i>Billie wouldn't accept
any of Frank's phone calls or

274
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:09,960
<i>answer his letters, so

275
00:13:10,086 --> 00:13:12,433
<i>I knew it was going to take
something big to get her back.

276
00:13:15,716 --> 00:13:18,500
<i>Something that would make Billie
feel like her and Frank were even.

277
00:13:18,828 --> 00:13:21,531
<i>Since Billie was mad at Frank
for showing me her naked picture,

278
00:13:21,665 --> 00:13:23,851
<i>we decided to show
Frank to the whole world.

279
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:31,801
<i>Joy decided the problem with her picture
was going to need a big solution, too.

280
00:13:32,788 --> 00:13:34,911
<i>So she got out her
poison cookie recipe

281
00:13:35,306 --> 00:13:37,922
<i>and made a special delivery
to take care of everything.

282
00:13:38,146 --> 00:13:42,351
Gentlemen, put your hands
together for Catalina!

283
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:45,691
Jump, jump, jump...

284
00:13:48,065 --> 00:13:50,810
<i>Turned out Joy no longer
had the killer instinct and

285
00:13:50,937 --> 00:13:52,621
<i>swapped out the main ingredient.

286
00:13:59,045 --> 00:14:01,931
<i>This moment would forever be
captured in Joy's memory...

287
00:14:03,165 --> 00:14:04,110
Occupied!

288
00:14:04,245 --> 00:14:05,703
You're lucky you're not dead, bitch.

289
00:14:05,827 --> 00:14:08,273
<i>And more importantly in her camera.

290
00:14:16,428 --> 00:14:17,700
<i>It had been days, and

291
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:19,922
<i>we were still waiting to hear
something from Billie.

292
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:23,082
Do you know a three-letter word
that might have a six in it?

293
00:14:23,937 --> 00:14:24,671
Excuse me.

294
00:14:25,038 --> 00:14:29,491
I'm here to see Frank Stump.
I'm Billie Cunningham, his girlfriend.

295
00:14:34,118 --> 00:14:36,352
- She's here! Billie's here!
- Really?

296
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:38,033
Thanks, Earl.

297
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:39,460
Hey, I got to get her some flowers.

298
00:14:39,596 --> 00:14:41,652
You think anyone would mind
if I take any carnations off

299
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:43,041
of Jose's memorial in the yard?

300
00:14:43,055 --> 00:14:45,720
If anyone cared about Jose,
he'd still be alive.

301
00:14:46,127 --> 00:14:48,520
Tell Billie I'll be right there.
And only say that.

302
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:51,482
Jose's dead?

303
00:14:51,615 --> 00:14:55,353
Oh, man, I never got to tell him
it was me who played that joke on him.

304
00:14:57,007 --> 00:14:58,721
I took the skinheads'radio,

305
00:14:58,728 --> 00:15:00,450
and I hid it in Jose's bed.

306
00:15:08,468 --> 00:15:10,310
Frank will be right here.

307
00:15:10,987 --> 00:15:11,960
No costume?

308
00:15:12,095 --> 00:15:13,522
We're making love today.

309
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:14,731
Ah, that's sweet.

310
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,282
Actually, I'm glad I saw you.

311
00:15:16,765 --> 00:15:20,410
That stuff you said last time about life
giving a second chance got me thinking.

312
00:15:20,547 --> 00:15:22,780
And I re-enrolled in nursing school.

313
00:15:23,165 --> 00:15:25,303
<i>Turned out, Billie used
to be on a good path.

314
00:15:25,427 --> 00:15:28,412
<i>Frank met her on the day she graduated
Community College, and,

315
00:15:28,538 --> 00:15:30,593
<i>well, things went downhill from there.

316
00:15:31,176 --> 00:15:33,340
<i>Frank was already leading
a life of crime, and

317
00:15:33,646 --> 00:15:36,300
<i>being a romantic, he wanted
someone to share his life with.

318
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:37,752
Go ahead. Take something.

319
00:15:38,366 --> 00:15:38,960
What?

320
00:15:39,008 --> 00:15:41,472
Go, go, do it. It's fun.
Go ahead. Take something.

321
00:15:48,038 --> 00:15:49,923
Okay, your turn.

322
00:15:56,397 --> 00:15:58,572
<i>And while stealing may have
given Billie a rush,

323
00:15:58,705 --> 00:16:00,432
<i>she still worried
about the consequences.

324
00:16:00,558 --> 00:16:02,490
Do you think we're going
to hell for all this?

325
00:16:03,417 --> 00:16:05,762
You know, I don't believe
in heaven and hell.

326
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,923
I think death is more
like an after-party

327
00:16:08,057 --> 00:16:11,250
where everyone goes to the same club
and drink some beers,

328
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:14,241
- smoke a little something-something.
- Like the Peach Pit After Dark.

329
00:16:14,376 --> 00:16:15,171
Totally.

330
00:16:19,118 --> 00:16:20,770
<i>But love can make you do
crazy things.

331
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:22,430
<i>Like armed robbery.

332
00:16:27,015 --> 00:16:28,152
Nobody move!

333
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:32,701
- Honey, honey, honey.
- Sorry. Sorry.

334
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:35,252
I know it's not how we practiced it,
but I just got really excited.

335
00:16:35,378 --> 00:16:36,892
Sorry, everyone. Sorry.

336
00:16:37,205 --> 00:16:38,302
When you said that stuff,

337
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:41,561
I kind of looked at my life
and realized I was tired of being a...

338
00:16:41,687 --> 00:16:42,781
Hairy loser?

339
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:45,083
I was just going to say loser.

340
00:16:45,486 --> 00:16:46,612
No, no, you're fine.

341
00:16:46,748 --> 00:16:49,392
I meant that's how it felt
when I turned my life around.

342
00:16:49,565 --> 00:16:50,741
Doing good feels good.

343
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,322
Yeah, and doing bad feels bad.

344
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:54,742
- It sounds so simple.
- Why don't are people do it?

345
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:55,813
I don't know.

346
00:16:55,966 --> 00:16:57,702
Well, it feels great.

347
00:16:57,876 --> 00:17:00,582
Except I'm missing a class
to be here right now.

348
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:01,552
Two, actually.

349
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:02,742
It's a long drive.

350
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:05,141
Wait, you're missing
classes for Frank?

351
00:17:05,647 --> 00:17:07,501
Not that Frank's not great.

352
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:10,273
I mean, the guy can
make wine out of shampoo.

353
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:12,322
I'm not even sur if
Jesus can do that.

354
00:17:12,976 --> 00:17:14,113
He's great.

355
00:17:15,245 --> 00:17:17,313
Well, now that we're
getting back together,

356
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:19,842
I'm probably going to have to take
a little break from school.

357
00:17:19,975 --> 00:17:24,082
Maybe try and start up again in a year
or two, or 13 when he gets out.

358
00:17:24,228 --> 00:17:26,020
Someday I will do it.

359
00:17:28,057 --> 00:17:28,741
Right.

360
00:17:28,987 --> 00:17:31,223
Well, I'll go get him.

361
00:17:33,335 --> 00:17:34,993
<i>I was in a rough spot,

362
00:17:34,997 --> 00:17:36,661
<i>one I'd never been in before.

363
00:17:36,908 --> 00:17:38,241
<i>I had to make a choice between

364
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,133
<i>helping someone on my list

365
00:17:40,136 --> 00:17:41,900
<i>helping someone
who really deserved it.

366
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,552
Frank, we need to talk.

367
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:49,820
<i>I explained to Frank that...

368
00:17:49,826 --> 00:17:51,711
as much as he wanted Billie
back in his life,

369
00:17:51,848 --> 00:17:54,240
<i>not having him in hers
was what she needed,

370
00:17:55,016 --> 00:17:56,533
<i>and that if he really loved her,

371
00:17:56,667 --> 00:17:59,530
<i>he'd let her go so she could live
the life she was meant to.

372
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:01,622
You're right.

373
00:18:03,077 --> 00:18:06,063
She's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

374
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:09,881
I'm the worst thing
that's ever happened to her.

375
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:12,890
Guess it's time for me to just
man up and do the right thing.

376
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,943
I've always had trouble saying
good-bye to women in my life.

377
00:18:17,815 --> 00:18:20,252
I think it's'cause my grandmother
breast-fed me too long.

378
00:18:21,665 --> 00:18:22,373
Okay.

379
00:18:25,826 --> 00:18:27,163
<i>I waited for Frank because,

380
00:18:27,297 --> 00:18:30,323
<i>while I may have made him feel like
he wasn't good enough to be with Billie,

381
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:32,122
<i>I didn't want him to feel alone.

382
00:18:39,706 --> 00:18:40,720
Billie.

383
00:18:42,377 --> 00:18:44,432
I think you'll make a great nurse.

384
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,932
Take care, Earl.

385
00:18:55,946 --> 00:18:57,221
How did it go?

386
00:18:57,747 --> 00:18:59,730
I felt like crying.

387
00:19:00,026 --> 00:19:01,403
Felt like killing you.

388
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:03,660
Felt like calling my grandma.

389
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:05,403
I felt thirsty.

390
00:19:05,918 --> 00:19:09,860
But mostly, once I said it, I...
I felt like a real decent guy.

391
00:19:10,366 --> 00:19:12,302
Maybe for the first time in like...

392
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:15,090
ever.

393
00:19:15,526 --> 00:19:17,410
That's what happens
when you do the right thing.

394
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:18,833
Yeah, it's nice.

395
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,792
It's real nice.

396
00:19:21,508 --> 00:19:23,390
You know,
it's not as nice as

397
00:19:23,528 --> 00:19:27,421
high fiving myself in the mirror
when I'm doing a hot chick...

398
00:19:27,968 --> 00:19:29,542
but it's nice.

399
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:31,492
<i>I was really proud of Frank,

400
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,243
<i>but more important,

401
00:19:33,245 --> 00:19:34,720
<i>Frank was proud of himself.

402
00:19:43,197 --> 00:19:45,501
<i>and I couldn't stop
thinking about Billie

403
00:19:45,698 --> 00:19:48,233
<i>that there was someone out there
working to do good things in life

404
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:50,072
<i>after years of doing bad.

405
00:19:50,425 --> 00:19:51,771
<i>Someone like me.

406
00:19:56,256 --> 00:19:57,600
Naked picture!
