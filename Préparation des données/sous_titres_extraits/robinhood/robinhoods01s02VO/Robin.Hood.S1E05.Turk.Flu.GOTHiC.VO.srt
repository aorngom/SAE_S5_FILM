TREETON MINE

2
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:10,600
Out of the way. Get out of my way!

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,333
Son, you're too late. Your uncle's dead.

4
00:00:20,467 --> 00:00:23,467
They're all dead!

5
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:39,733
Here, Father.

6
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:41,733
Gisborne's coming.

7
00:00:41,933 --> 00:00:44,067
Tell him.

8
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,200
Go on, tell him!

9
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:50,700
Father, tell him his mine's a death trap.

10
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:52,533
You're not working down there no more.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:55,933
We'll not go down there again.

12
00:00:56,133 --> 00:00:57,267
You'll do as I say.

13
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:58,267
My brother' s dead.

14
00:00:58,467 --> 00:01:00,733
And your behavior suggests
that you'd care to join him.

15
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:02,267
We're on strike.

16
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:06,867
Till it's shored up properly you'll not get a miner
down that death pit of yours.

17
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,133
You'd rather die here?

18
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,000
Yes.

19
00:01:10,133 --> 00:01:16,133
I'd rather my soul roamed free up here
than get trapped down there again.

20
00:01:23,267 --> 00:01:25,667
Stay!

21
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:30,600
They claim they would rather die
than go back down.

22
00:01:30,733 --> 00:01:33,733
You're giving them choices.

23
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,800
Very good, Gisborne.

24
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,333
Well!

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,800
Enjoy the strike.

26
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,467
It'll make you feel... much better.

27
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,000
Goodbye.

28
00:02:09,133 --> 00:02:09,867
They're all sacked!

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,733
- Really?
- Although we need the mine working...

30
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:15,467
Really?

31
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,400
Forward planning, Gisborne.

32
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,733
It's all under control.

33
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:25,067
There will be fresh workers arriving
who will do as they're told!

34
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:28,067
By tomorrow morning, this mine...

35
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:31,267
will be working.

36
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,933
Unlike you lot.

37
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:37,867
Bury this man's body with the others.
His family will pay for the grave.

38
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,667
If they will not work,
they will not be fed

39
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,533
until I see fit.

40
00:02:43,667 --> 00:02:45,600
Anyone giving them assistance will hang.

41
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:50,267
You are all sacked. Go home.

Episode 5
"TURK FLU"

45
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:32,133
SHERWOOD FOREST

46
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:48,867
I knew you'd be like this.

47
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:51,267
If you're so bothered about
the archery competition...

48
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,067
I'm not!

49
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,567
If you're so bothered...

50
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,533
we could always have a little competition here.

51
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:06,600
I don't want to be in the archery competition.
Even if there is a silver arrow for the winner.

52
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,667
Just as well.

53
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:12,133
Because by the time we've done a little hunting
and had ourselves a decent feast,

54
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:18,867
there 'll be no time to go to Nottingham
and get ourselves hanged.

55
00:04:19,933 --> 00:04:24,533
Father, I will avenge thee. Gisborne will pay.

56
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,933
Food parcels?

57
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,133
You can't give to us.

58
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,667
Gisborne's forbidden it.

59
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,333
He has spies everywhere.

60
00:04:42,933 --> 00:04:45,200
Nothing like a tragedy to
bring out the do-gooders.

61
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,733
Where is your leader?

62
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:51,333
Where is Robin Hood?

63
00:04:51,867 --> 00:04:53,933
Or are you alone?

64
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:59,467
Does Robin Hood think himself too important
to do his own mischief now?

65
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,200
A man of few words? No matter.

66
00:05:02,333 --> 00:05:06,600
I'm sure I will hear your voice
when you plead for your life.

67
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:07,933
Not even an "Ouch".

68
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:13,867
"Ouch" costs nothing.
Surely you could utter an "ouch".

69
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:29,200
The trap worked.

70
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:31,467
We caught one. A cart.

71
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,067
Let's go. Let's go!

72
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:38,933
Heap! Rubbish heap!

73
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,067
And you! Rubbish heap.

74
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,867
Here. It's all I have of value.

75
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,667
Take it!

76
00:05:57,867 --> 00:06:01,333
Pretty! Not very appetizing.

77
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:05,733
Livestock?

78
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:06,867
Take one.

79
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,467
And let me on my way.

80
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,067
They'll work for you.

81
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,667
They understand simple commands.

82
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:17,467
New men for the Sheriff's mine.

83
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,267
Slaves?

84
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:24,800
KNIGHTON HALL

85
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,800
Sir Guy.

86
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:27,733
She is home?

87
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,667
Yes.

88
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,733
Come through.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,733
Father?

90
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,200
Are you hurt?

91
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,467
I caught it on a splinter on the door.

92
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,333
Let me see.

93
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:45,067
No, no, no, it's nothing.

94
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:46,800
What does Gisborne want?

95
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,467
I don't know. Come on.

96
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,400
Come down.

97
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:00,267
Marian.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,400
To what do we owe the honor, Sir Guy?

99
00:07:03,533 --> 00:07:06,467
Today I am attending...

100
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,733
I'm sure you would expect,

101
00:07:08,933 --> 00:07:12,133
as you yourself may also have the intention...

102
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:17,533
But I thought, even so, that would not
necessarily make my question redundant.

103
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:19,333
Attending...?

104
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:22,667
The Sheriff's fair.

105
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:27,133
So what's your answer?

106
00:07:27,267 --> 00:07:30,933
Forgive me, Sir Guy.
I do not yet understand the question.

107
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:34,733
I am inviting you to the fair
as my personal guest.

108
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:37,133
I fear I wouldn't be good company.

109
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,267
I'm tired.

110
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:44,600
You're ashamed of your hair.

111
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:48,600
But I thought of that. I have a gift for you.
It's a shawl...

112
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:49,867
You can...

113
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,333
I didn't sleep well. That is all.

114
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:54,067
You're declining my invitation?

115
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,667
Marian is delicate. She has wounded...

116
00:07:56,867 --> 00:07:57,867
Wounded?

117
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,733
Pride.

118
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:02,733
Wounded pride.

119
00:08:02,867 --> 00:08:05,000
My hair. As you guessed.

120
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:07,667
Thank you.

121
00:08:08,467 --> 00:08:11,600
So you will come?

122
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,133
Good!

123
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,133
It should be an interesting day.

124
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:21,933
The Sheriff is convinced
that he'll lure Robin Hood.

125
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,800
He's put up a silver arrow as a prize.

126
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:24,533
Silver?

127
00:08:24,733 --> 00:08:25,800
Yeah, but it won't work.

128
00:08:25,933 --> 00:08:29,333
Hood is delegating his crimes to lackeys now.
I confronted one this morning.

129
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:30,267
An outlaw?

130
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,467
Or a disguised villager.

131
00:08:32,667 --> 00:08:33,800
I'll find him.

132
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:36,733
He is marked, I inflicted a wound to his arm.

133
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:41,333
I was being kind. I should have killed him.

134
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:44,800
Well, I'll send a coach for you then.

135
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:48,400
Good day.

136
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:51,867
My Lady.

137
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,267
Sir Guy.

138
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,800
I think you owe me an explanation, young lady.

139
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:07,733
It was you, wasn't it?

140
00:09:07,933 --> 00:09:12,533
There are people starving. People whose menfolk
have died at the mine. Should we do nothing?

141
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:16,267
What? You think you're Robin Hood now?

142
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,933
Is that it? You're in competition with Robin?

143
00:09:19,133 --> 00:09:20,133
This is no competition.

144
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:21,867
I've been helping people far longer than him.

145
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:22,933
How much longer?

146
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:24,600
Three years.

147
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:28,467
I do not know you at all, do I?

148
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:34,467
I never thought I'd see this again.

149
00:09:34,667 --> 00:09:35,867
Outrageous.

150
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,867
Disgrace.

151
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,533
Trading people.

152
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:44,000
Would you like some more wine?

153
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,867
I'm not being funny but...
you brought him here for a picnic?

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,533
We need him. He's our way into the mine.

155
00:09:57,667 --> 00:09:59,267
There is no way into the mine.

156
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,933
We're going to stop this.

157
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:02,733
This is a gift.

158
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:06,533
We're going to close the mine once and for all.

159
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:10,400
We will stop this human trafficking.

160
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:14,933
I thought you were gonna slit me throat.

161
00:10:15,067 --> 00:10:16,467
Or worse.

162
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,933
We don't do throat-slitting.

163
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:21,067
It's too messy.

164
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:23,600
Now you've eaten I'd like to feed
your prisoners.

165
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:24,667
Not meat.

166
00:10:24,867 --> 00:10:26,400
It makes them spirited, you see.

167
00:10:26,533 --> 00:10:28,733
Oh, and keep your distance.

168
00:10:28,867 --> 00:10:31,733
Don't let them breathe near you.

169
00:10:31,867 --> 00:10:32,800
Disease!

170
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:35,733
Some of our soldiers dropped dead
after getting too close.

171
00:10:35,867 --> 00:10:36,933
Dropped dead?

172
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:41,267
Aye, one minute stood there
strong as you, the next...

173
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,133
brains dripping from their nostrils.

174
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,600
Water.

175
00:10:54,733 --> 00:10:56,133
That'll do 'em.

176
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:58,400
They had some scraps earlier.

177
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,733
There used to be a decent living
to be made from selling folk.

178
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:05,467
Then the Pope goes and bans trading Christians.

179
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,333
Thank heavens King Richard likes
his wars abroad.

180
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:12,133
Will?

181
00:11:12,333 --> 00:11:12,933
They need water.

182
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:14,933
Yeah, I'm on it.

183
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,800
Look, you seriously don't believe...

184
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:18,933
No!

185
00:11:19,133 --> 00:11:20,333
Well, give them water.

186
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:21,933
Can't you see they're suffering enough?

187
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:25,533
I notice you're not doing it.

188
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,333
Listen, there is no disease.

189
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:30,267
It's ignorance and superstition and...

190
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,267
You are a genius!

191
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:36,733
John!

192
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:38,933
Have a drink with our friend.

193
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:39,533
What?

194
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,733
There 's something I need to find
in the forest. I need some time.

195
00:11:42,867 --> 00:11:47,867
If he loses consciousness, then so be it.

196
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,933
No consciousness.

197
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:16,267
Could have been worse. If you'd not ordered
the slaves, we'd have had to close the mine.

198
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,500
"Slaves?" I prefer "out-workers."

199
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:24,333
This... mourning, it is tiresome. 
Isn't it? Outlaw it.

200
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:29,067
Au moins, personne ne regrettera
nos nouveaux mineurs  quand ils rentreront. 

201
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,467
Les femmes !

202
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,333
Comment arrivent-elles à faire un son si aigüe,
que vous voudriez vous percer vous-même les tympans ?

203
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,733
Ne vous marriez jamais, Gisbourne.

204
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:46,667
Les femmes! Gardez-les à distance. Pensez... 

205
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,600
Pensez à un lépreux.

206
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:07,933
Juste après le départ à la guerre de Robin,
vous souvenez-vous que j’étais malade ? 

207
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:11,000
Sarah la cuisinière me veillait.
Elle était toujours si gaie, et un jour, elle n’est plus venue.

 208
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:14,667
Mon médecin m’a dit que sa fille était
très malade,

 209
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,067
et l’a été très longtemps.
 
210
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,333
Quand tu dormais, j’allais voir Sarah
et donnais mes médicaments à sa fille.

211
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:22,667
Très noble, mais si tu te fais prendre...

212
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,133
Sarah était bouleversée 
et je me suis occupée d’elle.

213
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:27,333
Et c’est là que j’ai décidé...

214
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:29,333
...que je pouvais aussi faire la guerre.

215
00:13:29,467 --> 00:13:31,333
Je pouvais faire la guerre à la pauvreté.

216
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:35,267
Sir Edward, ma Dame ?
Sir Guy attend.

217
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,467
Nous devons nous débarrasser des gardes de la mine.

218
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:43,800
L’un de vous doit aller dans la cage
comme prisonnier.

219
00:13:43,933 --> 00:13:46,467
Nous avons besoin d’un homme dedans pour
répendre la rumeur de la fièvre Turque.

220
00:13:46,667 --> 00:13:47,533
Un volontaire !

221
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:48,533
Oui, Much.

222
00:13:48,667 --> 00:13:49,133
Merci.

223
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,667
Allan.

224
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,533
Et alors, je dois manger ça ?

225
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,400
Non ! Seulement mâcher.

226
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,333
Il n’y a rien à craindre.

227
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:02,533
Quand les gardes croiront qu’un prisonnier
est malade, ils se sauveront ! 

228
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:06,267
Seulement les plus stupides y croiront.
Je veux dire... 

229
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,133
<i>La Fièvre Turque ?!</i>

230
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,600
Les gens craignent l’inconnu.

231
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,733
Je n’ai pas eu peur.

232
00:14:14,533 --> 00:14:15,733
Non !

233
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:18,533
Will, tu l’as prouvé toi-même.

234
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:20,867
Même si tu avais des doutes,

235
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,267
les hommes du shérif...
Ils vont foncer dans le panneau.

236
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,467
Ça ne marchera jamais !

237
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:27,467
J’ai une autre idée.

238
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,533
Au lieu de faire confiance 
à la stupidité des hommes du shérif...

239
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:31,800
Pourquoi...

240
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:33,933
- Laisse !
- C’est à moi.

241
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:36,933
Volé !

242
00:14:38,133 --> 00:14:41,067
Tu parles Anglais !

243
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,667
Tu ne vas pas aimer ça, Robin,

244
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:02,133
mais je crois que c’est Marianne
dans la voiture de Gisbourne.

245
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:03,733
Elle doit aller à Nottingham.

246
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,200
La fête du shérif.

247
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,067
VILLAGE DE TREETON
- Pourquoi ai-je fait ça ?

248
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,267
Pourquoi lui ai-je dit de défier Gisbourne ?

249
00:15:09,467 --> 00:15:13,733
J’aurai du me taire.

250
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:16,733
Je lui ai dit de se battre pour lui-même.

251
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:17,867
Mais qu’ai-je fait ?

252
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:23,800
Gisbourne et le shérif se sont dirigés
vers moi et je n’ai rien fait.

253
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:28,267
Toi et moi, on va s’en sortir.

254
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:32,333
Ne t’inquiète-pas,
je ne vais rien faire de stupide.

255
00:15:32,533 --> 00:15:36,733
Pourquoi ferai-je quelque chose
de stupide ?

256
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:41,867
Il y a juste une chose que je dois faire.

257
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,733
A plus tard.

258
00:15:44,933 --> 00:15:47,333
A plus tard.

259
00:16:04,533 --> 00:16:05,533
Islama ?

260
00:16:05,667 --> 00:16:08,067
Islama.

261
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,667
Je connais une façon simple et efficace
de te rendre ta liberté.

262
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:17,000
Et bien moins dangereuse que d’aller
à une mine fortement gardée.

263
00:16:17,133 --> 00:16:20,400
Ouvrir la cage :
c’est simple et efficace.

264
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:21,667
Non...

265
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,267
C’est malin.

266
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:29,133
Renonce à ton Dieu. Alors, 
on ne pourra plus t’acheter ni te vendre.

267
00:16:29,267 --> 00:16:30,600
Renoncer à mon Dieu ?

268
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:33,400
Et clamer ta foi dans le Dieu Chrétien.

269
00:16:33,533 --> 00:16:34,800
Mais tout est bien,

270
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,600
car les Dieux savent tout.

271
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,467
Donc ton Dieu saura que tu feints.

272
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,267
Pourquoi feindre d’être Chrétien ?

273
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:46,667
Vous tuez mon peuple au nom du Christianisme !

274
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:49,267
Les Chrétiens ne peuvent pas être vendus.

275
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,000
Le shérif ne t’achètera pas.

276
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:52,067
Tu peux être libre,

277
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,000
et nous pourrons rentrer manger.

278
00:16:56,133 --> 00:16:58,467
Puisque c’est si facile...

279
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,267
Fait-le.

280
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,533
Renie ton Dieu.

281
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,133
Moi ?

282
00:17:05,267 --> 00:17:09,200
Tu ne crois pas 
qu’il peut lire dans ton cœur ?

283
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,867
Bien sûr que si.

284
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:13,533
Il le peut.

285
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:17,333
Je pourrai le renier, comme ça.

286
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:22,333
Je ne crois pas en Dieu.

287
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,000
Non, vraiment pas.

288
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:27,533
Voilà !

289
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:32,267
Aller ! Aide-moi à attacher Brooker.

290
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:41,533
J’y crois... de toute évidence.

291
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,800
Où est le marchant ?

292
00:17:43,933 --> 00:17:48,267
Bien sûr, il doit être chez lui
Avec un gobelet de bon vin rouge.

293
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,933
Je regardais votre archer, 
quel est son nom ?

294
00:17:50,133 --> 00:17:51,200
Michael le Rouge.

295
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:54,133
Michael le Rouge !

296
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:55,333
Oui !

297
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:56,400
Seigneur,

298
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:59,600
Si vous préférez rentrer à Nottingham,
Je serai ravi de rester et...

299
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:01,467
Quoi ? Vous laissez la responsabilité
de la mine ? Désolé. 

300
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:07,600
Rappelez-moi combien de minerai de fer
avez-vous remonté aujourd’hui ? 

301
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,133
Vous ! Vous ne pouvez pas 
aller faire quelques manœuvres ? 

302
00:18:12,267 --> 00:18:16,133
Rien de plus drôle à faire, aujourd’hui !

303
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:20,000
Gauche ! Gauche ! Gauche !

304
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:33,733
Nous renvoyons Brooker.

305
00:18:33,933 --> 00:18:37,267
Quand le shérif et Gisbourne retournent à 
Nottingham, Allan fait son truc...

306
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,867
...là, nous attaquons.

307
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,933
Voilà ce qu’on va faire.

308
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:46,867
Tu vends tes prisonniers au shérif,
comme prévu.

309
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,333
Allan sera juste derrière toi,
déguisé en prisonnier.

310
00:18:49,467 --> 00:18:54,267
Si tu nous donnes, sache-le, nous pourrions 
revoir notre position sur les égorgements.

311
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:56,933
Au feu ! Il y a le feu !

312
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,467
Punition de Dieu !

313
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:04,667
C’est de ma faute !

314
00:19:04,867 --> 00:19:07,400
Je suis désolé, Seigneur ! 
J’ai vraiment la foi ! Vraiment !

315
00:19:07,533 --> 00:19:09,867
Much, vas-tu te taire ?

316
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,067
Comment as-tu allumé ce feu ?

317
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,000
Laissez-nous partir !

318
00:19:12,133 --> 00:19:12,867
Nous essayons de vous aider.

319
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:16,267
Vous nous avez volés pour nous revendre.
Vous ne valez pas mieux que lui.

320
00:19:16,467 --> 00:19:18,067
S’il te plait, laisse-moi t’expliquer.

321
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:23,933
Si vous ne voulez pas nous aider,
alors vous pourrez partir. Tu as ma parole. 

322
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:27,133
Quel est ton nom ?

323
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,667
Djaq.

324
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,667
Djaq.

325
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:31,667
Nous vous aiderons à fuir.

326
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,600
Mais si vous partez maintenant, 
le shérif aura encore besoin de mineurs.

327
00:19:35,733 --> 00:19:39,800
D’autres prisonniers arriveront dans un mois,
des gens comme vous.

328
00:19:39,933 --> 00:19:42,667
Nous allons détruire la mine,
mais nous avons besoin de vous. 

329
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:44,133
Comment nous aideras-tu à fuir ?

330
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:45,933
Le shérif vous achètera,

331
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,067
et nous vous donnerons cet argent.

332
00:19:47,267 --> 00:19:50,600
Et nous vous mènerons à des gens
qui vous feront passer au port. 

333
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,133
Vous avez fait de nous des ennemis.

334
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:54,667
Et maintenant, vous jouez au protecteur ?

335
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,933
Et demandez notre aide ?

336
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:05,400
Laisse-les décider ! Si vous voulez tenter
votre chance, alors allez-y. 

337
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:08,133
Que disent-ils ?

338
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:13,200
Il dit que si vous ne nous laissez
pas partir, il vous tuera.

339
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:15,733
Ce n’est pas ce qu’il a dit.

340
00:20:15,867 --> 00:20:17,467
Il a dit "nou sa lei".

341
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,133
Ça veut dire « prier ».

342
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:21,533
C’est ce que tu veux faire ? 
Te laver et prier ?

343
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:24,733
Prier ? Nou sa lei ?

344
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:30,200
Ensuite nous aiderez-vous ?
S’il vous plait.

345
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,667
Gauche ! Gauche ! Et demi-tour !

346
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,933
Aller, regard droit !

347
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:44,067
Robin dit que nous devons...

348
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:47,267
Vous m’espionnez !

349
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:50,867
Non ! Robin, il... Nous devons garder...

350
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:00,867
Souviens-toi. Si ça tourne mal,
Tu mourras !

351
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,333
Ce retard...?

352
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:10,133
J’ai contourné la forêt.
Je ne voulais pas croiser les hors-la-loi.

353
00:21:10,267 --> 00:21:11,667
Ai-je demandé un itinéraire ?

354
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,933
Non ! Le mois prochain, vous serez à l’heure,
Compris ?

355
00:21:15,133 --> 00:21:18,933
Je serai à l’heure le mois prochain,
mon Seigneur.

356
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,467
Les chaînes !

357
00:21:34,867 --> 00:21:37,867
J’aime ça, c’est bien.

358
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Tu n’espères pas le prix fort pour celui-là ? 

359
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,733
Il n’a pas de muscles.

360
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:45,800
Il a de l’esprit.

361
00:21:45,933 --> 00:21:50,333
De l’esprit ? 
J’ai vu plus d’esprit dans du fromage. 

362
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:07,467
Qui es-tu ?

363
00:22:07,667 --> 00:22:10,200
Je suis Rowan, fils de Dunne,
Et je vais tuer Gisbourne.

364
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:12,800
Si tu fais ça maintenant,
la mine restera ouverte. 

365
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:18,133
Tu saboteras notre plan,
et mettras en danger un de mes hommes. 

366
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:19,867
Si un seul meurt pendant le mois...

367
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,733
Je le retiendrai sur ta prochaine note.

368
00:22:21,933 --> 00:22:25,133
Payez cet homme, Gisbourne.

369
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:29,733
Bien. Alors, au travail.

370
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:32,400
Le fer, le fer !

371
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,267
Je ne peux pas le laisser partir.

372
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,733
Si la mort du shérif ou de Gisbourne avait aidé Nottingham, 
je les aurai tués il y a des mois.

373
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:50,200
Ils méritent de mourir.

374
00:22:50,333 --> 00:22:53,267
Ne préfèrerais-tu pas de les voir
perdre tout ce à quoi ils tiennent ? 

375
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,333
Comme quoi ?

376
00:22:54,467 --> 00:22:55,733
La mine.

377
00:22:55,933 --> 00:22:59,133
Le minerai est leur force, leur pouvoir.

378
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:04,067
Dedans !

379
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:10,333
Donnez-moi un autre travail, s’il vous plait !
Je travaillerai deux fois plus.

380
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:13,200
Tu n’es pas prisonnier de guerre,
tu es Anglais !

381
00:23:13,333 --> 00:23:15,133
Je suis un déserteur.

382
00:23:15,267 --> 00:23:17,533
Il y en avait plein comme nous avec...

383
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,533
C’est le Fièvre Turque.

384
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:21,533
Ça a anéanti tout le monde sauf moi.

385
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,467
La fièvre Turque ?

386
00:23:23,667 --> 00:23:25,333
Nous, les Anglais n’y avons pas
de résistance.

387
00:23:25,533 --> 00:23:29,867
Ecume aux lèvres, convulsions, pourriture.

388
00:23:31,533 --> 00:23:34,667
On l’attrape en étant aussi proche que toi.
En quelques minutes,

389
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,533
ce liquide noir suinte du nez.

390
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:42,733
Allez travailler.

391
00:23:47,733 --> 00:23:51,000
VILLE DE NOTTINGHAM

392
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:02,533
Je ne sais pas ce qui est pire,

393
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:05,800
Les veuves éplorées, 
ou les paysans en parade.

394
00:24:05,933 --> 00:24:07,933
Voyez-vous celui avec qui 
vous vous êtes battu ?

395
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:10,133
Petit et blessé.

396
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:12,267
Bien que sa blessure soit
sous sa manche gauche. 


397
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,467
Peut-être dois-je ordonner 
de relever les manches ?

398
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:19,600
Peut-être devriez-vous vous rappeler
qui donne les ordres.

399
00:24:20,267 --> 00:24:22,467
- Marianne.
- Mon Seigneur.

400
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,333
Les lepreux, Gisbourne. Les lepreux.

401
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:36,733
Lord save me! Save me!

402
00:24:36,867 --> 00:24:37,867
Kill him, quick!

403
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,467
No! His blood will poison the air.

404
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,400
If you're gonna kill someone, kill me, please.
I can feel it starting in me!

405
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:45,067
Don't let me suffer.

406
00:24:45,733 --> 00:24:48,067
What's that?

407
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:52,200
What's wrong with him? Quick!

408
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:55,067
Let's get out of here!

409
00:25:05,067 --> 00:25:08,867
John! Keep him conscious.

410
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:14,867
What is this stuff? Tastes weird.

411
00:25:16,133 --> 00:25:18,133
You'll be fine as long as you don't...

412
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:18,933
swallow it.

413
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:20,467
I said, don't swallow it!

414
00:25:20,667 --> 00:25:21,333
You'll be fine.

415
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,933
Lay fires!

416
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,600
Around those beams and inside!

417
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,667
Let me light them.
I'll burn the place to t'ground.

418
00:25:26,867 --> 00:25:28,000
I don't think so. We'll do that.

419
00:25:28,133 --> 00:25:31,133
No! Let Rowan.

420
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:34,067
For his father.

421
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:38,867
Thanks to the rogue element amongst you,

422
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:44,467
I have been forced
to introduce new security measures.

423
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:49,733
The guilty object to security
because the guilty have something to hide.

424
00:25:53,933 --> 00:25:58,867
I expect your full co-operation.

425
00:25:59,867 --> 00:26:05,533
No man shall wear a sleeve on his left arm.

426
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:18,533
Oh, and, er...

427
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:22,533
do have a lovely fair. Thank you.

428
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:28,333
That one... Ooh, no.

429
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,200
Can I not keep the money?

430
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:38,067
You are a despicable, heartless, soulless 
slave-trader, lucky to escape with your life.

431
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,133
That's a no.

432
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:40,867
Now go.

433
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,267
Go?

434
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:49,933
I'll see that you suffer!

435
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:54,667
You're letting him free?

436
00:26:54,800 --> 00:27:01,267
He'll run straight to the Sheriff of Nottingham
and he and Gisborne will get on their horses...

437
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:01,867
Oh, I get it.

438
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:02,733
Get what?

439
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:05,467
They come here, you go to your fair.

440
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:08,600
Much as it saddens me to drag
Gisborne away from his wooing.

441
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:09,333
Gisborne's wooing?

442
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:11,667
Yes. Marian!

443
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:15,400
Remember the road I told you of?

444
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:20,533
- When you get to the Abbey...
- Mention your name.

445
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:23,867
Salaam alaikum, Djaq.

446
00:27:24,733 --> 00:27:26,933
Alaikum Salaam.

447
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:30,533
God speed, Robin.

448
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,333
Much!

449
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:34,067
What's going on with the pilot fire?

450
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I'll do it.

451
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:54,467
Primitive!

452
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,200
Well, I think we deserve
an outing to Nottingham

453
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:02,867
for such a smooth and successful operation. In fact, 
apart from Allan's ingestion of a certain plant root...

454
00:28:03,067 --> 00:28:06,600
Which will do what to me exactly?

455
00:28:06,733 --> 00:28:11,333
...I'd say today has gone without a...

456
00:28:12,533 --> 00:28:14,533
John!

457
00:28:14,733 --> 00:28:18,333
Step forward Ford, son of Ford.

458
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,267
No sign of Robin Hood.

459
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:28,067
He's a coward.

460
00:28:29,667 --> 00:28:32,933
Your Michael the Red better be a winner.

461
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:37,267
I don't want to have to give
this silver arrow away.

462
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,733
But surely if my man wins then...
the silver arrow will be mine.

463
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:47,067
If Robin Hood turns up and wins, 
I will hang him and keep the arrow.

464
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,800
If he doesn't, and your man wins, he will return it.

465
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:54,667
I see...

466
00:28:54,867 --> 00:28:59,267
Or I will hold you responsible.

467
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,467
When are we gonna burn the mine?

468
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,533
The Sheriff will be coming.

469
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,800
We can't until we've rescued John.

470
00:29:13,933 --> 00:29:14,667
I'm going down there.

471
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,533
What?

472
00:29:15,733 --> 00:29:16,667
To get stuck down there with him?

473
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,533
To help him!

474
00:29:17,667 --> 00:29:19,667
We broke up the ladders for firewood.

475
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,933
If we can't pull him out...

476
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:22,400
He could be bleeding to death.

477
00:29:22,533 --> 00:29:23,800
Maybe he just can't breathe.

478
00:29:23,933 --> 00:29:25,733
So he suffocates, will that suit you better?

479
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:27,067
I'll go down there.

480
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,267
You need someone smaller.

481
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,933
You couldn't lift him.

482
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,733
I'll help him lift himself.

483
00:29:31,867 --> 00:29:33,200
He could be bleeding.

484
00:29:33,333 --> 00:29:34,667
Or suffocating, I heard.

485
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,267
My father was a physician.

486
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:37,333
Oh, great!

487
00:29:37,467 --> 00:29:41,000
My father was a blacksmith.
It doesn't mean I can make a horseshoe.

488
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:42,733
No Djaq, wait. Please!

489
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:44,400
If there is something you can do.

490
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,600
I can stop the blood. Bring him round.

491
00:29:46,733 --> 00:29:47,467
Then do it.

492
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,467
I need silver.

493
00:29:49,667 --> 00:29:50,467
Look over there.

494
00:29:50,667 --> 00:29:52,400
There must be some along with the iron ore.

495
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:53,867
Silver?

496
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,267
He wants paying now?

497
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:56,933
Traces of silver.

498
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,733
Not coins.

499
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:02,933
And water, quickly.

500
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,133
Do as he says.

501
00:30:05,267 --> 00:30:11,133
Sorry, Lord, I will fast for a day and a night,
just please let us get him out.

502
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,267
Silver and this - acid. 
Together make a liquid, stop the bleeding.

503
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:20,733
You don't need to understand.

504
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,267
Fine.

505
00:30:22,467 --> 00:30:24,067
Save Gisborne's mine.

506
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:26,133
Save his wealth.

507
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:28,867
I'm going to go and tear his heart.

508
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:33,200
Let's see him woo a dead woman.

509
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:41,733
Not quite the bullseye. They say the peel of 
an apple can predict who a woman will marry.

510
00:30:41,867 --> 00:30:43,133
How?

511
00:30:43,267 --> 00:30:48,467
The curl of the peel represents
the first letter of his name.

512
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,933
Our next archer is Michael the Red.

513
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:55,267
Ah. This will impress you.

514
00:30:56,667 --> 00:30:58,533
I cut myself.

515
00:30:58,733 --> 00:30:59,867
Your arm?

516
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,533
No, my hand.

517
00:31:02,667 --> 00:31:03,533
Look.

518
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:07,533
I must have got some on my sleeve.

519
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:31,667
I think he wants us to follow him.

520
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:36,200
The mine's...!

521
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,733
Robin Hood.

522
00:31:37,867 --> 00:31:38,867
Robin Hood, mm...

523
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:39,933
Fire!

524
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:41,667
Robin Hood, mine, fire.

525
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,667
Soldiers! Soldiers!

526
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:57,067
It's witchcraft.

527
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,000
Because we don't know what it is?

528
00:32:00,133 --> 00:32:02,733
We made him trust us,
so we have to trust him.

529
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:06,933
Just drop the second line down.

530
00:32:08,133 --> 00:32:10,800
Lower me down.

531
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:13,733
We should have gone after Brooker.

532
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:17,733
He'll have told the Sheriff by now.

533
00:32:22,467 --> 00:32:24,467
Three days and three nights.

534
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,933
Not a morsel will cross my lips.

535
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:30,200
Just get us out of here.

536
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,133
Come on, big man.

537
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:50,200
Wake up...

538
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,267
Please!

539
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:54,067
Wake up!

540
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:56,533
There you go. Here, smell this.

541
00:32:56,733 --> 00:32:59,467
It will help you...

542
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:04,467
Put this on.

543
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:07,467
Around your foot.

544
00:33:14,533 --> 00:33:17,133
Pull!

545
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,267
Master, the Sheriff. What do we do?

546
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:26,333
Come on, John!

547
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:29,067
Come on, John!

548
00:33:32,267 --> 00:33:34,200
They're getting closer.

549
00:33:34,333 --> 00:33:36,933
Come on, almost there! Pull, John, pull!

550
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:03,733
Get John into cover. I'll take care of this.

551
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,933
Into the trees. Go! Run!

552
00:34:25,133 --> 00:34:28,733
Where are your guards,
on their refreshment break?

553
00:34:40,933 --> 00:34:42,133
Get it out!

554
00:34:42,333 --> 00:34:45,067
Get the fire out!

555
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:58,733
Does anyone smell burning?

556
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:00,000
Get the fire out!

557
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:04,533
Forget the outlaws! Save the mine!

558
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:08,800
Never forget the outlaws!

559
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:14,800
- Where are the others?
- Gone.

560
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:16,533
Hey, Rowan will be sorry he missed the blaze.

561
00:35:16,733 --> 00:35:19,733
Him? He's gone to take revenge on his enemy.

562
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,733
Why? Gisborne's here.

563
00:35:21,933 --> 00:35:25,400
His woman! To tear his heart 
ut by killing his woman.

564
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:27,933
Gisborne hasn't got a...

565
00:35:28,133 --> 00:35:29,933
Marian!

566
00:35:30,067 --> 00:35:33,067
Nothing tempts pennies from the poor
like their hope of silver.

567
00:35:33,267 --> 00:35:36,400
- Name.
- Rowan, son of Dunne.

568
00:35:36,533 --> 00:35:39,733
Rowan, son of Dunne.

569
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:42,267
You'd not sooner keep your penny, son?

570
00:35:42,467 --> 00:35:46,067
No, thanks. A penny well spent.

571
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:52,533
The next contestant will be...

572
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:08,467
This place is done for. You 
should have expected him.

573
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,333
It was obvious this was a target.

574
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:17,467
With respect, my Lord, he was supposed to be
in Nottingham trying to win the silver arrow.

575
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,533
Over there.

576
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,800
He's following Marian, quick!

577
00:37:01,333 --> 00:37:03,333
My Lady!

578
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:08,133
It'll be quick. I'm a good shot.

579
00:37:13,533 --> 00:37:15,867
Your father died at the mine, didn't he?

580
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,933
How do you know?

581
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:20,800
It's difficult to explain.

582
00:37:20,933 --> 00:37:23,667
But I know he must have loved you very much.

583
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,533
Everybody knew how dangerous it was
to go down that mine.

584
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:27,867
I told him not to.

585
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,200
He wanted to feed you. And your family.

586
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,400
Your lover knew it wasn't safe!

587
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:35,000
Your father must have known too.

588
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:40,267
I'm going to kill you. Make him suffer. 
Make him understand loss.

589
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,200
At the cost of your own life?

590
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,267
It's what Gisborne deserves.

591
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,667
Your mother will lose
the man of her house twice.

592
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,667
What about her suffering?

593
00:37:50,867 --> 00:37:52,733
I can't do nothing.

594
00:37:52,867 --> 00:37:54,467
Just stand and do nothing.

595
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:58,267
Well, if you want to hurt the Sheriff,
win his silver arrow.

596
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:02,400
You say you are a good shot. Win it.

597
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:05,067
Use the silver, melt it down into coins.

598
00:38:05,267 --> 00:38:07,867
You could feed your family for months.

599
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:11,067
Compensate all the miners ' widows.

600
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:15,800
Or would you rather shoot
an unarmed woman?

601
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:34,400
Marian?

602
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:37,267
Better late than never, I suppose.

603
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:41,667
Make sure this one wins the silver arrow.

604
00:38:45,267 --> 00:38:47,733
Robin!

605
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:50,467
Help me.

606
00:38:51,533 --> 00:38:55,867
Will then next contestant please take his mark!

607
00:38:57,733 --> 00:39:02,467
The next contestant is Rowan, son of Dunne.

608
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:18,467
Bravo!

609
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:22,200
- Robin Hood!
- Seize him!

610
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:53,667
That arrow will feed the miners
for a whole winter.

611
00:39:53,867 --> 00:39:56,333
Come on, let's go.

612
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:05,533
Him... Rowan.

613
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:10,400
No food or drink for one day and night
and then he'll be fine.

614
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:14,333
Oh, just as well seeing there 's
so little venison left...

615
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:17,067
You're fasting too, aren't you?

616
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:18,667
You made a promise...

617
00:40:18,867 --> 00:40:19,733
...to God!

618
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:23,133
You don't know it was Him who got us out.

619
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:25,067
We might have got out of there anyway.

620
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,733
And if it had been Him,
there would have been a sign.

621
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:30,400
And there was no sign.

622
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:32,267
So I am gonna to build a fire, cook some food,

623
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:37,333
and there 's nothing any of you can do about it.

624
00:40:41,667 --> 00:40:47,933
Champion of the Sheriff's Fair, and winner 
of the silver arrow, Rowan, son of Dunne.

625
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,733
Ho! A sign!

626
00:41:12,467 --> 00:41:16,067
Which means I have to fast.

627
00:41:17,667 --> 00:41:21,467
Except God wants me to eat.

628
00:41:25,467 --> 00:41:28,000
Oh! Quite a lot...

629
00:41:28,133 --> 00:41:32,200
Djaq! Come and join us.

630
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,867
For good?

631
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,400
Well, I was thinking just for dinner, but...

632
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:41,133
And I was thinking for good.

633
00:41:41,467 --> 00:41:43,867
Perhaps I should have let
your big friend here die, huh?

634
00:41:43,867 --> 00:41:45,867
Then there would have been a vacancy.

635
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:50,267
It wouldn't be safe for you to join us.

636
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:53,333
For us or for him?

637
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:56,067
For her.

638
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,267
I guessed as much.

639
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:05,667
What's your name? Your real name.

640
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
Safiyya.

641
00:42:07,933 --> 00:42:11,933
- Safiyya...
- But I prefer you to call me Djaq.

642
00:42:12,067 --> 00:42:14,333
Djaq!

643
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,067
Well, your expertise did
 help to save Little John's life.

644
00:42:20,267 --> 00:42:23,867
For which we will be eternally indebted.

645
00:42:24,067 --> 00:42:29,067
Anyone have a problem with
a woman joining the gang?

646
00:42:30,867 --> 00:42:31,533
Er... Can you, er...

647
00:42:31,733 --> 00:42:35,533
I'm a rubbish cook!

648
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:39,800
Well, looks like we're cooking dinner then.

649
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,733
If the fire thing was Djaq and not

650
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:51,333
a sign then...

651
00:42:51,533 --> 00:42:55,667
does that mean I can eat or...
