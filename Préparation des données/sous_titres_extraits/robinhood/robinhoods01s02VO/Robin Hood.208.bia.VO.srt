1
00:00:05,342 --> 00:00:07,417
Are the men ready
to cause chaos in Clun?

2
00:00:07,537 --> 00:00:10,318
Yes, my lord.
This scheme sounds elaborate.

3
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:12,260
Stop whining, Gisborne.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,677
If I'd wanted a wife, I would
have found one with better legs.

5
00:00:15,797 --> 00:00:17,994
Trust me, Carter is a godsend.

6
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:21,073
Shoulders back.
He kills people for fun.

7
00:00:21,193 --> 00:00:22,953
Then why are we paying him?

8
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:25,246
Fun...

9
00:00:26,153 --> 00:00:27,227
and money.

10
00:00:45,496 --> 00:00:46,999
Look at the hands!

11
00:00:56,881 --> 00:00:59,506
Morning, Carter. This is Gisborne.

12
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,241
My Lord Sheriff.

13
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:09,267
Respect, Gisborne, hm? I like it.

14
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,271
Why don't you ever kiss my ring, hm?

15
00:01:13,121 --> 00:01:15,520
So... you know what you're going to do?

16
00:01:15,907 --> 00:01:19,009
Retrieve the Great Pact of Nottingham
and kill Robin Hood.

17
00:01:19,792 --> 00:01:22,960
Believe me, my lord, nothing
would give me greater pleasure.

18
00:01:23,126 --> 00:01:25,153
Robin Hood is as good as dead.

20
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,976


21
00:02:17,898 --> 00:02:19,200
Robin! Sheriff's men.

22
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,073
Wait! You don't want them to see
you with outlaws.

23
00:02:24,193 --> 00:02:27,279
I don't care! They're attacking
the village. Let's get them.

24
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,367
- Why are they doing this?
- "Why"?!

25
00:02:29,487 --> 00:02:31,400
Robin, there isn't time for "why"!

26
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:33,931
- Let's go.
- Marian, we'll wait and see how many...

27
00:02:34,051 --> 00:02:35,716
- Come on!
- Marian!

28
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:39,652
There's too many of them!

29
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:54,707
Marian!

30
00:02:56,062 --> 00:02:56,840
Move!

31
00:03:04,386 --> 00:03:06,885
You, stay there! Don't move!

32
00:03:21,835 --> 00:03:24,520
- Who's that?!
- Robin! The gallows!

33
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,120
Friend, behind you!

34
00:03:56,691 --> 00:03:58,466
The Sheriff's men are running away.

35
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:01,568
Oh, my Lord! Oh, you've saved us!

36
00:04:01,688 --> 00:04:02,754
He's good.

37
00:04:04,005 --> 00:04:05,119
He's very good.

38
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,748
- Don't ever tie me up!
- You didn't listen to your orders.

39
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:25,980
People were dying.

40
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,516
- You can't be seen with us.
- Why not?!

41
00:04:28,636 --> 00:04:31,955
- Robin, I AM with you.
- Because if the Sheriff finds out,

42
00:04:32,128 --> 00:04:34,286
or Gisborne, you can never
go back to the castle.

43
00:04:34,406 --> 00:04:35,985
I don't want to go back.

44
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:39,719
Well, I'm glad. But you're not ready
to make that decision.

45
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:46,481
Thank you, my friend.

46
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:48,998
I owe you my life.

47
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:51,527
Yes, you do.

48
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,512
But I won't take it just yet.

49
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:55,500
Carter.

50
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:57,397
Robin Hood.

51
00:04:58,118 --> 00:04:58,947
Much.

52
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:01,782
Nice, er... move.

53
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:04,683
- Do I know you?
- I...

54
00:05:05,566 --> 00:05:06,839
We've never met.

55
00:05:07,619 --> 00:05:10,228
These soldiers,
why are they attacking innocent people?

56
00:05:10,348 --> 00:05:12,080
- He's wounded!
- It's nothing.

57
00:05:13,412 --> 00:05:14,223
Djaq!

58
00:05:15,072 --> 00:05:16,400
Come on. Get up.

59
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,599
Let's get him out of here. Come on.
John!

60
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:21,482
John! Will, get the quiver.

61
00:05:24,769 --> 00:05:27,001
- I'm sure I've met him.
- Much, let it be!

62
00:05:27,121 --> 00:05:28,183
I'm sure.

63
00:05:28,885 --> 00:05:30,154
I know that face.

64
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:36,519
- Did you fight in the Holy Land?
- Yes. But we didn't meet.

65
00:05:38,029 --> 00:05:41,031
- How can you be sure?
- YOU, I'd have remembered.

66
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,199
Why have you come back?

67
00:05:45,073 --> 00:05:46,489
Stabbed in the back.

68
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:49,602
Did you get him? The one who did it?

69
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,760
No... but I've been biding my time.

70
00:05:54,683 --> 00:05:57,223
- Preparing.
- You looked prepared today.

71
00:05:57,839 --> 00:06:00,120
You could have taken on
a whole army of them.

72
00:06:00,634 --> 00:06:03,706
Must be disappointed, though,
with, er... today's wound.

73
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:07,434
I mean, if you're planning to go back
to the Holy Land and kill him.

74
00:06:08,057 --> 00:06:10,359
- He's here.
- In England?

75
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,506
It wasn't me, was it?

76
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:18,286
It worked, it worked!

77
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:21,759
Hood saw the poor, innocent
people of Clun being attacked.

78
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,742
And then dashed, rather dashingly,
in to save them.

79
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,702
And we lost several guards.

80
00:06:26,903 --> 00:06:29,524
Yes, yes, yes.
It's very unfortunate. Um...

81
00:06:29,644 --> 00:06:32,456
Send their families
a basket of fruit. Small.

82
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,233
But it worked!

83
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:37,568
Carter left with Hood.
Hood could already be dead!

84
00:06:39,223 --> 00:06:42,160
Oh, and by the way,
Marian sent a message.

85
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:45,501
What message?

86
00:06:47,344 --> 00:06:49,639
"I'm not coming back, get over it,"

87
00:06:50,153 --> 00:06:53,360
"and for God's sake, change
your clothes once in a while!"

88
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:54,529
Very funny!

89
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:56,750
She ran away.

90
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:58,859
Guy, sit down.

91
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:06,144
She ran away

92
00:07:06,647 --> 00:07:09,148
the minute her dad died. Hm?

93
00:07:10,344 --> 00:07:12,868
Now, what does that tell us?
It tells me...

94
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:17,066
that the crusty one was the only thing

95
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:18,832
keeping her here.

96
00:07:19,961 --> 00:07:20,691
No.

97
00:07:21,761 --> 00:07:23,623
There was something between us.

98
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,003
No.

99
00:07:25,964 --> 00:07:29,292
She's not coming back, Guy. Move on.

100
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:32,942
I'll tell you what...

101
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:37,090
I'll give you a kiss, hm?
That'll make you feel better.

102
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,481
Oh, come along.

103
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,400
In fact, if Hood's dead,
I'll give you TWO kisses! Come along.

104
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:43,990
- Kissy, kiss, kissy!
- Get off me!

105
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:49,853
Grow up, Gisborne.

106
00:08:03,167 --> 00:08:07,139
Are you going to apologise to me?
You could have got me killed.

107
00:08:07,295 --> 00:08:10,511
I think you would have got
yourself killed without my help.

108
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:13,479
- Charging in like that.
- Robin, I've been fighting

109
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:16,247
these idiots for years,
as the Nightwatchman.

110
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,325
- Remember?
- I know. On your own.

111
00:08:19,837 --> 00:08:21,772
This is a team, Marian.

112
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:24,240
You went crashing in
and we all had to follow.

113
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:27,414
And in battle, that's a cardinal sin.
We work together.

114
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,015
- You mean they do as you tell them?
- Yeah! Yeah, they do.

115
00:08:32,856 --> 00:08:35,751
Until you learn to do the same,
you can stay here at the camp.

116
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:38,359
- What?!
- I mean it, Marian.

117
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:40,092
You need to calm down.

118
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:45,758
Look, I don't need
to be mollycoddled, all right?

119
00:08:45,878 --> 00:08:48,493
Good! Because you're
not going to get it here!

120
00:09:08,921 --> 00:09:10,679
Have you been sent to baby-sit me?

121
00:09:15,231 --> 00:09:17,826
Why do you do everything he says?

122
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:21,880
I thought you used to have
your own men, Little John.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,143
I did. But there can only be one leader.

124
00:09:27,542 --> 00:09:28,737
This is not

125
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:32,839
how I thought it would be...
living in the forest.

126
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,834
I can't breathe...

127
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,036
in here.

128
00:09:39,446 --> 00:09:41,576
It's worse than living in the castle.

129
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,562
Come here.

130
00:09:58,321 --> 00:10:00,308
It's not the here or there, is it?

131
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,765
It's your father.

132
00:10:04,105 --> 00:10:05,959
You've lost your father.

133
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:08,588
And that's why

134
00:10:09,014 --> 00:10:11,335
I want to get on with things.

135
00:10:11,834 --> 00:10:12,767
In time.

136
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:14,812
In time.

137
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,840
You should be resting.

138
00:10:38,697 --> 00:10:41,120
- Things to do.
- What things?

139
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:03,006
- Stay here. Stay here.
- I will.

140
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:33,921
Let me guess...

141
00:12:35,404 --> 00:12:38,129
- the Sheriff sent you.
- He wants his Pact back.

142
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:40,634
No chance.

143
00:12:41,085 --> 00:12:42,919
- I guaranteed it.
- Yeah?

144
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,440
Well, you made a mistake.

145
00:12:46,069 --> 00:12:48,836
- Tell me where you've hidden it.
- I'll die first.

146
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:53,145
No... your friends will die first,
one by one, until you tell me.

147
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:57,627
See, that little look back...

148
00:12:59,422 --> 00:13:01,360
you just revealed your weakness.

149
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:05,556
Never look back, friend.
Now I know I've won.

150
00:13:07,862 --> 00:13:11,229
So... who shall we start with?

151
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:14,059
Your little sidekick in the Holy Land?

152
00:13:15,315 --> 00:13:17,279
Or do you have a soft spot for the girl?

153
00:13:18,468 --> 00:13:19,703
I thought so!

154
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:34,055
Unbelievable!

155
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:37,876
We took him in We pitied him
because he was wounded

156
00:13:37,996 --> 00:13:40,839
- I think that was his plan, Much.
- I know.

157
00:13:41,433 --> 00:13:42,912
I knew. Just...

158
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,090
outrageous!

159
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:51,382
- Marian...
- He'll tell us more

160
00:13:51,578 --> 00:13:54,687
if he knows we're happy to hurt him.
Won't he?

161
00:13:54,807 --> 00:13:58,040
- That's not how we're doing this.
- Speak for yourself.

162
00:13:59,064 --> 00:14:00,879
Just go and cook something.

163
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:03,983
- What, because I'm a woman?
- No, because I'm hungry!

164
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,108
What are we going to do with him?

165
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,880
We'll take him back to Nottingham.

166
00:14:14,413 --> 00:14:17,526
He's failed to find the Pact
and he's failed to kill me.

167
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:21,418
What do you think the Sheriff would do
to a man who's failed him that badly?

168
00:14:21,538 --> 00:14:23,396
Hang him by the neck.

169
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,872
If he's lucky.

170
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:28,200
Come on.

171
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:35,422
Wake up!

172
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,440
- What do you want?
- I want Marian.

173
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:44,553
- Do you know where she is?
- What do you think?

174
00:14:46,151 --> 00:14:49,318
How am I supposed to find her, then?
She could be anywhere.

175
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:50,630
Ask around.

176
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:54,000
Earn your keep.

177
00:14:57,881 --> 00:14:59,779
- Nottingham, then?
- No.

178
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:01,629
Clun first.

179
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:06,209
- Not you, Marian. You're staying here.
- Why?

180
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:09,800
Because...
I think you need some time alone.

181
00:15:10,338 --> 00:15:11,052
Why?

182
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,566
Because this isn't the Marian
I know and love.

183
00:15:13,686 --> 00:15:15,880
Sorry if you're disappointed,
this is who I am now.

184
00:15:16,228 --> 00:15:17,191
Really?

185
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:20,587
Well, I hope not. Come on, let's go.

186
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:22,723
Why Clun?

187
00:15:23,081 --> 00:15:26,600
Because there's something
I want him to see. Come on!

188
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:44,630
I'm sorry, Jane.

189
00:15:45,392 --> 00:15:48,900
We'll make sure you and your
family eat. You have my word.

190
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:51,179
Thank you, Robin.

191
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:54,009
Don't worry, Jane.
We'll set you straight. Here.

192
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,263
Come on.

193
00:16:01,523 --> 00:16:03,500
Her husband died because of you.

194
00:16:04,453 --> 00:16:06,319
I only killed Sheriff's men.

195
00:16:07,195 --> 00:16:10,128
And they only killed villagers
to make you look good.

196
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:13,465
Now, was that the Sheriff's idea
or was it yours?

197
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,157
- His.
- His.

198
00:16:15,358 --> 00:16:17,577
But you were happy to go along with it.

199
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:19,766
And you were happy
to see her husband die,

200
00:16:19,886 --> 00:16:21,778
if it meant that you'd get closer to me.

201
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:25,566
- What's your point, Locksley?
- My point, assassin...

202
00:16:27,978 --> 00:16:31,803
is there's widows here today, all trying
to comfort children who don't understand

203
00:16:31,923 --> 00:16:33,599
why their father didn't come home,

204
00:16:33,801 --> 00:16:37,370
- and their mother won't stop crying.
- If you want me to feel sorry,

205
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,654
- you're wasting your time.
- Am I?

206
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:43,475
Because there's a reason why you
don't like to look back, Carter.

207
00:16:44,483 --> 00:16:47,180
Because you don't want
to see what it is you do.

208
00:16:47,847 --> 00:16:51,482
Because you don't like what you do.
And d'you know how I know that?

209
00:16:53,551 --> 00:16:55,638
It's because I used to be like you.

210
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,999
I've killed in the Holy Land as well.

211
00:16:59,539 --> 00:17:01,566
- Boo-hoo!
- Boo-hoo...

212
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:25,879
- You could have had my eye out!
- You've got some nerve,

213
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,067
showing your face in the forest.

214
00:17:28,284 --> 00:17:30,583
I checked you were on your own first.

215
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:34,439
I know what the lads'll do to me,
but I figured I owe you this much.

216
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:37,891
- You're here for me?
- Gisborne wants me to find you.

217
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,397
Obviously I didn't tell him
you'd probably be here.

218
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,366
Obviously.

219
00:17:41,486 --> 00:17:44,066
No, but I'm going to need to tell him
something, right?

220
00:17:44,186 --> 00:17:47,877
I could tell you've joined the Sisters
of the Immaculate Conception,

221
00:17:47,997 --> 00:17:50,024
- Ripley convent.
- Would he believe that?

222
00:17:50,144 --> 00:17:50,839
Yeah.

223
00:17:51,493 --> 00:17:54,839
I was thinking, you could write a note.
Just say you want to be left alone.

224
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:57,359
A bit of praying, grieving or whatever.

225
00:17:57,865 --> 00:18:01,119
- Why would YOU help ME?
- Look, I'm not all bad.

226
00:18:02,157 --> 00:18:06,008
And any letters from the convent have
to be sealed by the mother superior.

227
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:08,305
- I can sort that.
- How?

228
00:18:09,182 --> 00:18:10,534
I'm good with nuns.

229
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,967
Ave Maria, gratia plena

230
00:18:13,624 --> 00:18:16,040
Dominus tecum Benedicta tu...

231
00:18:18,929 --> 00:18:21,719
Shhhh! You're all right.
I'm not going to hurt you.

232
00:18:22,065 --> 00:18:25,993
I just want to borrow your ring.
Here we are. Come here.

233
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,287
Lovely. Here you are.

234
00:18:31,379 --> 00:18:34,334
Buy yourself a new habit.
Say a little prayer for me.

235
00:18:39,505 --> 00:18:41,097
Right, Will, let's go.

236
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:49,935
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

237
00:18:50,055 --> 00:18:52,389
Everyone to me! Where did he go?

238
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:56,180
Where is he?
John, Will, check by the road.

239
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,199
You two, down there. Now!

240
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:03,174
- What about you?
- I'll stay here.

241
00:19:04,127 --> 00:19:06,805
- Go on, go.
- You would need two!

242
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:07,344
I accepted a contract to kill you.

243
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:10,318
I will fulfil that contract.

244
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,859
It's not just a contract...

245
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:16,664
is it, Carter?

246
00:20:18,744 --> 00:20:22,666
Much was right, wasn't he?
We did meet in the Holy Land.

247
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,931
You never met me. You met my brother.

248
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:29,846
- What was his name?
- You don't remember?!

249
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:32,476
You should. You killed him.

250
00:20:35,473 --> 00:20:37,582
- What was his name?
- Thomas.

251
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:39,075
"Thomas"?

252
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,340
And, yes, this is for him.

253
00:20:43,379 --> 00:20:45,165
I've waited for this moment.

254
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:48,516
I've imagined it so many different ways.
Meeting you.

255
00:20:48,636 --> 00:20:50,662
- Killing you.
- Good.

256
00:20:51,344 --> 00:20:53,425
Well, I hope it lives up to expectation.

257
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:55,344
It will. I've trained myself.

258
00:20:56,404 --> 00:20:59,541
I'm the best there is and I exist,
Locksley, to kill you.

259
00:21:04,308 --> 00:21:05,953
I didn't kill him, Carter.

260
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:09,933
You ordered him into a village.

261
00:21:11,143 --> 00:21:13,079
He called for help,
but you did not come.

262
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,185
You let him die.

263
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,470
I remember him.

264
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:20,138
- He was a good fighter.
- He was a war hero.

265
00:21:20,258 --> 00:21:24,248
Yeah. And he stopped listening.
He thought he was invincible.

266
00:21:24,392 --> 00:21:27,782
He led the charge into that village.
We told him it was dangerous.

267
00:21:27,902 --> 00:21:29,701
- He wouldn't listen.
- No.

268
00:21:30,367 --> 00:21:31,961
We tried to save him.

269
00:21:32,487 --> 00:21:33,839
- I tried.
- You're lying.

270
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:37,222
I was there when they
brought back his body.

271
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:39,758
The stretcher bearers
told me everything.

272
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,996
I told them to make up the story,

273
00:21:44,116 --> 00:21:46,651
so his family would remember him
as a war hero,

274
00:21:46,771 --> 00:21:48,944
not as a fool who got himself killed.

275
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:51,600
Rubbish!

276
00:21:54,296 --> 00:21:56,292
He wasn't the only one
who died that day.

277
00:21:56,412 --> 00:21:59,399
Morgan Foster died trying
to save him. Matthew Kent.

278
00:22:00,009 --> 00:22:02,719
You think I believe this?
You're just frightened to die.

279
00:22:02,993 --> 00:22:05,318
You were a coward then,
and you still are.

280
00:22:05,438 --> 00:22:07,279
- He cried when he died.
- Liar!

281
00:22:07,837 --> 00:22:11,346
He cried! And he said
"Tell my family I didn't cry"

282
00:22:11,656 --> 00:22:13,401
"Tell them I wasn't crying."

283
00:22:13,521 --> 00:22:16,178
"I was laughing
on the wrong side of my face!"

284
00:22:16,486 --> 00:22:20,328
That's what he used to say - "Laughing
on the wrong side of your face."

285
00:22:20,448 --> 00:22:21,999
How do you know that?

286
00:22:26,255 --> 00:22:29,564
I know, because I held him
in my arms when he died.

287
00:22:30,675 --> 00:22:31,408
No.

288
00:22:32,056 --> 00:22:33,188
He was a hero.

289
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,919
You killed him. You're lying.

290
00:22:37,168 --> 00:22:40,482
If you really think I'm lying,
you can kill me.

291
00:22:41,956 --> 00:22:44,025
If you think it'll give you peace...

292
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,919
then kill me now.

293
00:23:08,302 --> 00:23:09,577
He WAS a hero.

294
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,257
Just not on that day.

295
00:23:18,652 --> 00:23:20,170
What am I doing here?

296
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:24,499
I don't know what I'm doing.

297
00:23:31,355 --> 00:23:32,326
Help me.

298
00:23:34,272 --> 00:23:35,461
My brother...

299
00:23:38,441 --> 00:23:39,882
I loved him so much.

300
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,237
It's all right.

301
00:23:54,421 --> 00:23:55,250
Hey...

302
00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:57,658
come on.

303
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:01,992
It's all right.

304
00:24:04,342 --> 00:24:05,541
It's all right.

305
00:24:11,187 --> 00:24:12,279
Are you all right?

306
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,719
Why is he crying?

307
00:24:18,638 --> 00:24:19,888
He's not crying.

308
00:24:22,491 --> 00:24:25,004
He's laughing
on the wrong side of his face.

309
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:31,606
Well, now you know she's safe and well.

310
00:24:34,379 --> 00:24:36,956
And how do you know
that she's safe and well?

311
00:24:37,076 --> 00:24:38,025
She said.

312
00:24:39,382 --> 00:24:40,319
Did she?

313
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:45,084
I thought they took a vow of silence.

314
00:24:45,243 --> 00:24:46,824
No, I mean, the, um...

315
00:24:46,965 --> 00:24:49,984
the mother superior said,
when she gave me the letter.

316
00:24:50,104 --> 00:24:50,833
No.

317
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:54,584
No. This...

318
00:24:55,188 --> 00:24:57,438
- is not right.
- What do you mean?

319
00:24:58,903 --> 00:25:01,117
Marian cannot take holy orders.

320
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:03,788
She has a life to lead.

321
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,865
- Saddle my horse.
- Oh, I don't really do saddling.

322
00:25:09,094 --> 00:25:11,011
- Do as you're told!
- Sure.

323
00:25:11,381 --> 00:25:13,629
- Where are we going, then?
- Ripley convent.

324
00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:17,436
Yeah? Hang on! Doesn't she want
to be on her own, grieving and...?

325
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,901
- Get my horse!
- All right! All right.

326
00:25:23,082 --> 00:25:24,421
Thomas was my hero.

327
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,949
Whatever he did, I had to do, too.

328
00:25:28,753 --> 00:25:31,049
And when he joined the Knights Templar,

329
00:25:31,169 --> 00:25:32,738
I knew I had to follow.

330
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,562
I had only just joined when...
when he died.

331
00:25:37,549 --> 00:25:39,628
Thomas... You look like him.

332
00:25:40,564 --> 00:25:42,375
That's why I recognised you.

333
00:25:42,811 --> 00:25:44,992
I was determined to carry on for him.

334
00:25:45,185 --> 00:25:47,978
To be as good as him.
To get to the very top.

335
00:25:49,063 --> 00:25:52,073
- I joined the King's private Guard
- Like us!

336
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:54,503
And that's where I heard about you.

337
00:25:54,708 --> 00:25:58,199
Robin this, Robin that...
How great you were.

338
00:25:59,821 --> 00:26:01,798
And it made my blood boil.

339
00:26:03,607 --> 00:26:06,630
And every time I killed,
I imagined I was killing you,

340
00:26:07,485 --> 00:26:11,075
the man who took my brother
away from me. And when I returned...

341
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,403
I came straight to Nottingham,

342
00:26:13,757 --> 00:26:17,136
where the Sheriff has a contract
on your head. £500.

343
00:26:17,697 --> 00:26:18,717
- £500?!

344
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:20,919
So I figured...

345
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:25,270
with his plan to lure you to the
village, I'd get to you quicker.

346
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:29,559
So all this death
was for personal revenge?!

347
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:37,293
- When did you last see the King?
- Why?

348
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:40,989
Well, because...
we sent him a message,

349
00:26:42,481 --> 00:26:44,350
a very important message.

350
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,317
The messenger was a man called
Roger of Stoke. Do you know him?

351
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:48,617
I know Roger.

352
00:26:48,936 --> 00:26:51,426
No. He was expected, but did not return.

353
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,336
Great!

354
00:26:56,171 --> 00:26:58,129
So the King knows nothing
about Shah Mat?

355
00:26:58,249 --> 00:27:00,759
- Shah-what?
- That doesn't concern you.

356
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:06,223
- What can I do?
- What can you do...?

357
00:27:09,219 --> 00:27:11,039
You can do what you set out to do.

358
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:14,909
Go back to Nottingham,
give the Sheriff back his Pact...

359
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,687
and one dead outlaw.

360
00:27:21,161 --> 00:27:23,202
I can't believe we're trusting him.

361
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:25,174
He just tried to kill us.

362
00:27:25,294 --> 00:27:28,292
Of all of us, you and I know
what war can do to a man.

363
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:31,231
I've been to war,
but I didn't come back a mad killer.

364
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:34,297
Well, the demons work
in different ways, don't they?

365
00:27:36,053 --> 00:27:37,816
But they're the same demons.

366
00:27:37,936 --> 00:27:41,231
I've got my demons and you've never
held me like you held him.

367
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:42,806
Much! You haven't.

368
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:48,599
- You've never listened to MY story.
- That's because I was there with you.

369
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,267
It's my story, too.

370
00:27:51,259 --> 00:27:52,521
Yeah, I know.

371
00:27:53,826 --> 00:27:56,007
It's just we've never talked about it.

372
00:27:56,376 --> 00:27:59,042
- You know, we never talk.
- Well, all right,

373
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,059
- let's talk.
- No.

374
00:28:02,468 --> 00:28:05,479
- Not if you're doing it to humour me.
- Come on, Much!

375
00:28:05,681 --> 00:28:08,719
- Whatever I say you never listen to me.
- Well, you know that's not true.

376
00:28:09,564 --> 00:28:11,799
I told you I recognised Carter
from the Crusades.

377
00:28:13,389 --> 00:28:16,221
But you didn't believe me.
You'd listen to Marian...

378
00:28:17,524 --> 00:28:19,479
- spend time with her.
- Much...

379
00:28:19,993 --> 00:28:20,790
stop.

380
00:28:23,195 --> 00:28:24,177
All right?

381
00:28:29,496 --> 00:28:30,784
Old friend...

382
00:28:32,037 --> 00:28:34,264
you have a special place in my heart.

383
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,260
Do I?

384
00:28:38,959 --> 00:28:40,839
Well, do I really have to say it?

385
00:28:43,016 --> 00:28:44,865
No. Of course not.

386
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:54,679
Just once in a while, it would be nice.

387
00:28:58,513 --> 00:29:01,956
- What's he doing here?
- Don't worry. It's a long story.

388
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:05,994
- Allan was here.
- Allan?!

389
00:29:06,265 --> 00:29:08,439
Yeah. Gisborne sent him to find me.

390
00:29:08,716 --> 00:29:11,445
- I'll kill him!
- No, he was trying to help.

391
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,439
He sent Gisborne a letter
saying I'm at Ripley convent.

392
00:29:16,579 --> 00:29:18,887
The medicine's ready whenever you want.

393
00:29:20,603 --> 00:29:22,580
This could be dangerous, Robin.

394
00:29:23,416 --> 00:29:27,343
What is it you say, John?
"Today's a good day to die!"

395
00:29:27,975 --> 00:29:28,679
What?

396
00:29:28,881 --> 00:29:31,703
We're going to Nottingham
to collect Carter's fee.

397
00:29:32,112 --> 00:29:33,799
To give it to the people of Clun.

398
00:29:34,137 --> 00:29:37,079
"We"? I take it that includes me?

399
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:39,397
I'm sorry, Marian.

400
00:29:39,584 --> 00:29:42,007
Either I'm part of your gang or I'm not.

401
00:29:42,745 --> 00:29:45,759
Marian, for today,
please just stay here.

402
00:29:46,989 --> 00:29:48,111
Very well.

403
00:29:50,162 --> 00:29:52,394
- Excuse me?
- I said, "very well".

404
00:29:52,981 --> 00:29:56,055
- I bow to your authority.
- Thank you.

405
00:29:59,789 --> 00:30:02,263
- I'm ready.
- Do we really need him?

406
00:30:02,823 --> 00:30:05,879
Well, the Sheriff's not going to give
the money to anybody else now, is he?

407
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,533
- And if he betrays us?
- Then on my head be it.

408
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:10,039
If he does, blame me.

409
00:30:10,654 --> 00:30:13,719
- Good. I will... when we're dead.
- Good.

410
00:30:15,705 --> 00:30:18,165
And that's a rule
I'd like you to stick to,

411
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:21,639
- don't kill anybody unless you have to.
- Spoilsport!

412
00:30:23,032 --> 00:30:23,876
Djaq...

413
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,960
do your worst. Today is a good day.

414
00:30:29,041 --> 00:30:30,975
- I hate sayings.
- Come on.

415
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:36,758
<i>Creatorem...</i>

416
00:30:37,331 --> 00:30:38,811
<i>caeli et terrae</i>

417
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:44,854
<i>Et in lesum Christum</i>

418
00:30:49,117 --> 00:30:51,330
<i>Filium eius unicum</i>

419
00:30:55,966 --> 00:30:58,249
<i>Dominum nostrum</i>

420
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:04,239
<i>Passus sub Pontio Pilato</i>

421
00:31:08,596 --> 00:31:11,076
<i>- Crucifixus...
- What are you doing here?</i>

422
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,846
- You should be back at camp.
- I lied.

423
00:31:14,527 --> 00:31:17,354
- What are you going to do about it?
- Nothing.

424
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:18,319
What's this?

425
00:32:18,868 --> 00:32:20,045
Robin Hood.

426
00:32:20,165 --> 00:32:21,270
As promised.

427
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,080
Dead?

428
00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:25,421
Dead.

429
00:32:28,269 --> 00:32:29,174
Really?

430
00:32:32,548 --> 00:32:34,703
- Did you check him?
- Yes, Sir Guy.

431
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:38,934
Well, let's make doubly sure, shall we?

432
00:32:41,949 --> 00:32:43,454
Show me his neck.

433
00:32:54,297 --> 00:32:55,050
Guy!

434
00:32:56,351 --> 00:32:57,256
Marian?!

435
00:33:00,872 --> 00:33:02,389
What's happening here?

436
00:33:03,092 --> 00:33:05,340
Robin Hood. He's dead.

437
00:33:06,165 --> 00:33:07,516
Congratulations.

438
00:33:08,897 --> 00:33:10,580
I need to speak with you.

439
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:14,270
In private, please.

440
00:33:18,111 --> 00:33:19,033
Carry on.

441
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,538
Dei Patris omnipotentis

442
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,710
Sanctam Ecclesiam catholicam...

443
00:33:34,587 --> 00:33:36,848
Yes, yes, that's quite enough
of the gobbledegook.

444
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:39,009
Anywhere on the table will be fine.

445
00:33:52,035 --> 00:33:52,941
Exeunt.

446
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,999
It means, "get out".

447
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,812
- They're with me.
- Not any more.

448
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,607
Wait for me outside.
I will pay you then.

449
00:34:16,359 --> 00:34:18,839
We have... bad days.

450
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,145
We have good days.

451
00:34:25,258 --> 00:34:28,352
And... when we have

452
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:30,579
Robin Hood,

453
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:34,623
laid out dead on our table,
we have the best days of our lives!

454
00:34:36,912 --> 00:34:39,296
The, um... The Great Pact of Nottingham?

455
00:34:41,765 --> 00:34:44,933
Do you know what
I'm going to do with him now?

456
00:34:45,453 --> 00:34:48,635
That's not my concern, my lord.
My work here is done.

457
00:34:49,847 --> 00:34:50,574
Yes.

458
00:34:51,735 --> 00:34:54,363
Is that a subtile hint
that you'd like to be paid?

459
00:34:54,483 --> 00:34:56,118
I believe I've fulfilled my contract.

460
00:34:58,153 --> 00:34:59,786
Yes, I believe you have.

461
00:35:00,723 --> 00:35:02,773
- We shouldn't have left him.
- We had no choice.

462
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,681
What if Carter isn't one of us?

463
00:35:04,801 --> 00:35:07,665
- What if he tells the Sheriff?
- Then Robin's dead.

464
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,677
I received your letter.

465
00:35:14,039 --> 00:35:15,764
I was about to come and visit you.

466
00:35:15,884 --> 00:35:19,320
I asked to be left alone,
and still you were coming to see me?

467
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,127
You knew I would.

468
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:22,386
Yes.

469
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,642
And that's why I came.

470
00:35:26,813 --> 00:35:28,615
To ask you to please

471
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:30,536
leave me be.

472
00:35:32,303 --> 00:35:33,259
Marian...

473
00:35:35,402 --> 00:35:37,927
Do you seriously expect me to believe

474
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,121
that you have given yourself to God?

475
00:35:42,136 --> 00:35:44,930
Trust me,
I haven't given myself to anybody.

476
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:46,679
Not yet.

477
00:35:47,653 --> 00:35:49,927
Good, because until you do,

478
00:35:51,088 --> 00:35:54,250
I will always believe that
there is a chance for you and me.

479
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,839
- I need to think.
- Stop thinking.

480
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,079
Come home to me!

481
00:35:59,849 --> 00:36:01,918
You burned my home to the ground!

482
00:36:02,857 --> 00:36:03,877
Marian...

483
00:36:06,694 --> 00:36:08,403
if I could take that back,

484
00:36:09,129 --> 00:36:12,264
if I could show you the side to me
that wants to build a home,

485
00:36:12,384 --> 00:36:14,310
- not burn it down.
- I've seen it.

486
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:18,119
- Then why do you reject it?
- My father is dead.

487
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,204
I need time... to grieve.

488
00:36:25,356 --> 00:36:27,015
What better way to grieve

489
00:36:27,712 --> 00:36:30,313
than to create new life? Marian!

490
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:33,477
I thought that I might
never see you again.

491
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,867
I thought I might never...

492
00:36:38,185 --> 00:36:39,001
What?

493
00:36:42,428 --> 00:36:43,443
Kiss you.

494
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,153
Ooh, sorry.

495
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:55,870
The Sheriff wants you.
He's gonna put Robin's head on a spike.

496
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,060
We must continue this conversation soon.

497
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,582
Guy!

498
00:37:13,124 --> 00:37:15,340
I might have more work.
Are you staying in England?

499
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,840
I may return to the Holy Land.

500
00:37:18,833 --> 00:37:22,359
- Not to help King Richard?
- I've had enough of fighting Saracens.

501
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:25,760
I would, however,
like to learn more of their tricks.

502
00:37:26,186 --> 00:37:28,954
They are way ahead of us
with potions and remedies.

503
00:37:30,482 --> 00:37:34,180
They make a concoction to reduce
the breathing of a man to nothing.

504
00:37:35,329 --> 00:37:38,055
- He seems to be dead, but is not.
- Fascinating.

505
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,489
A clue.

506
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,065
And when the same man drinks
the opposing concoction,

507
00:37:44,317 --> 00:37:47,339
he comes back to life, just like that.

508
00:37:49,015 --> 00:37:51,978
- Really? Just like what?
- Just like this!

509
00:37:57,142 --> 00:37:58,080
Alive?!

510
00:38:04,012 --> 00:38:04,720
Really!

511
00:38:06,089 --> 00:38:08,845
- I'll take that money.
- I'm not paying you now,

512
00:38:08,965 --> 00:38:11,880
now that the stiff has
stepped off the stretcher!

513
00:38:14,103 --> 00:38:15,850
- Kneel.
- Make me.

514
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,919
With pleasure.

515
00:38:25,917 --> 00:38:28,529
- What's she doing here?
- She saved your life.

516
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:31,794
Guy...

517
00:38:33,279 --> 00:38:34,414
I have to go.

518
00:38:34,839 --> 00:38:35,566
Go?

519
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,886
- You can't go.
- I can.

520
00:38:38,287 --> 00:38:42,209
- And I must. Look, this was a mistake.
- Marian, this wasn't a mistake.

521
00:38:42,329 --> 00:38:44,619
This was the most perfect thing
that has ever happened.

522
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,111
I am grieving, Guy.

523
00:38:46,609 --> 00:38:48,471
I misled you. I'm sorry.

524
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,586
- I'm sorry.
- You're misleading yourself.

525
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:57,309
I know. I've done it. I told
myself I didn't need you,

526
00:38:58,653 --> 00:39:01,450
that other things would satisfy me,
politics,

527
00:39:02,245 --> 00:39:03,133
power.

528
00:39:03,894 --> 00:39:06,687
- Yet here we are.
- I have to get back.

529
00:39:07,542 --> 00:39:09,468
Before they realise I'm missing.

530
00:39:09,588 --> 00:39:11,529
- Back to the convent?
- Yes.

531
00:39:12,106 --> 00:39:13,317
Marian, no.

532
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:16,116
I forbid you to go.

533
00:39:23,264 --> 00:39:24,922
See you back at the camp.

534
00:39:31,826 --> 00:39:33,959
<i>Alarm! They're in the castle!</i>

535
00:39:34,321 --> 00:39:36,244
Looks like they're missing us.

536
00:39:36,655 --> 00:39:39,669
- Are you ready?
- Sure you don't want to kill anyone?

537
00:39:39,789 --> 00:39:41,742
We're much more likely
to get killed ourselves.

538
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:44,568
Ah, come on.
We're much too good for that!

539
00:39:44,875 --> 00:39:46,801
All right. Let's find out.

540
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,395
<i>Search everywhere!</i>

541
00:40:07,329 --> 00:40:08,621
Carter! Quick!

542
00:40:15,917 --> 00:40:16,640
Quick!

543
00:40:51,327 --> 00:40:53,036
- Robin! Here!
- Robin!

544
00:41:01,671 --> 00:41:04,757
- Do you do this often?
- It seems to, yeah!

545
00:41:05,084 --> 00:41:07,380
It really would be simpler to kill them.

546
00:41:07,593 --> 00:41:10,309
I know. But where would be
the fun in that, eh?

547
00:41:14,928 --> 00:41:18,052
- I'd better be off.
- Are you sure you don't want to stay?

548
00:41:18,358 --> 00:41:22,357
I do. But I'm going back to the Holy
Land to visit my brother's grave.

549
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:25,079
Say goodbye properly.
Tell him I'm sorry.

550
00:41:26,064 --> 00:41:28,119
I thought I was honouring his memory.

551
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,440
And I thought I could do something
useful. Warn King Richard for you.

552
00:41:34,917 --> 00:41:35,720
Thank you.

553
00:41:41,434 --> 00:41:43,639
Well, you disobeyed me.

554
00:41:44,395 --> 00:41:45,747
I saved your life!

555
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:49,789
- And you kissed Gisborne.
- And you tied me up.

556
00:41:50,158 --> 00:41:53,014
- And you could have got us all killed.
- I'm sorry.

557
00:41:54,821 --> 00:41:56,836
I'm not used to taking orders.

558
00:41:57,137 --> 00:41:58,200
But I can learn.

559
00:42:00,186 --> 00:42:02,187
I'd like to be part of your gang.

560
00:42:03,447 --> 00:42:06,342
And I'm not used to you
being in the forest, but...

561
00:42:06,921 --> 00:42:07,837
I'll learn.

562
00:42:09,412 --> 00:42:10,253
Truce?

563
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:12,565
Yeah, truce.

564
00:42:15,871 --> 00:42:17,477
Safe journey, my friend.

565
00:42:56,016 --> 00:42:58,090
- There's a messenger here.
- From Lady Marian?

566
00:42:58,210 --> 00:42:59,348
No, from the King.

567
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,440
He wants me to send
a note back with Lardner.

568
00:43:04,804 --> 00:43:06,891
Beware of the power of Lardner's ring.

569
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:10,360
- What is Lardner's ring?
- Robin, the Sheriff's coming!

570
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:14,098
- You're surrounded, Hood!
- Maybe you could use me as a hostage?

571
00:43:14,218 --> 00:43:18,086
- Gisborne! If I die, Marian dies.
- Marian!

572
00:43:18,277 --> 00:43:20,114
- Will you marry me?
- What?!
