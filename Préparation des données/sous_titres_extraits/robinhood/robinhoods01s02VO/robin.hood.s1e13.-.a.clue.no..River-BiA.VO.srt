1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:02,012
- The King is coming.
- To Nottingham?

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,853
Something has changed.
The King is returning.

3
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:07,408
- Gisborne is saying...
- Gisborne is saying he'll marry Marian.

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:09,695
- I promised to marry him when the King returns.
- Under duress.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,771
Yes, to save my life and my father' s.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,737
- You do not love him!
- He has qualities.

7
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,572
Gisborne was unwell, so he said.

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,333
But he went to the Holy Land
to try to kill the King.

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,695
The physician came every day.

10
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:23,135
- Who was this physician?
- Pitts is his name.

11
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,973
- What illness did he have?
- Fever. Contagion.

12
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,255
- Tell me the truth.
- Sir Guy had business in London.

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,296
He had business in the Holy Land.

14
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,496
The physician will talk.
He did not treat Gisborne.

15
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:36,414
- I do not know how to thank you.
- We'll think of something.

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,015
Allan. Where is Allan? And Will.

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,249
I have a plan of my own.

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,658
The Nightwatchman?

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,017
One final fling with something to make me feel
more comfortable in my marriage.

20
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,330
The Sheriff has a scheme.
He intends to kill the King.

21
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,573
Time to play, Nightwatchman.

22
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,299
This Nightwatchman business
will be the death of you.

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,770
- Gotcha.
- Robin.

24
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:10,575
John!

25
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:13,333
- This is not good, is it?
- Maybe not so good.

26
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,297
She is going to die.

27
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:20,329
- What are you doing? You'll hurt her!
- Where she is she cannot feel a thing.

28
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:30,813
Where is the physician? I cannot wait.

29
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,059
What have I done?

30
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,769
Unless I am badly mistaken, the Sheriff
and Gisborne will arrive at any moment.

31
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:40,011
- Your friend is dead.
- Dead?

32
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,089
Marian.

33
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,089
Robin! Oh, Robin!

34
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,778
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

35
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:54,258
You're getting slack, my friend.

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:58,094
Could it have been easier for me, hm,

37
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:01,889
if you'd led me by the hand
to your little hidey-hole?

38
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,255
A clue, no.

39
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:07,377
Allan. Where are Allan and Will?

40
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,618
Now.

41
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,649
- Stand!
- Oh.

42
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,698
Stand or we shoot!

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,532
- Er, there are two of you.
- Last warning.

44
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,450
How many do you think
there could be of them?

45
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,735
A dozen or so at the most.
Of the inner circle.

46
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,539
- And how many of the outer circle?
- I don't know.

47
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,337
You seem to misunderstand me, my friend.

48
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:51,412
You do not have a bargaining position.

49
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:55,015
Robin, what do I do with him?
If he dies you have nothing against Gisborne.

50
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,009
Wait.

51
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:02,776
Why are they not running? Why are
they not running? Hood must be in there.

52
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:05,818
John? Now what?

53
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,693
Bored now. Kill them!

54
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,010
Positions.

55
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,331
John, I think we're going to die.

56
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,211
- A good day.
- What?

57
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,814
A good day to die.

58
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,017
- What?
- It's a saying.

59
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,614
- Take aim.
- I hate sayings.

60
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,896
There 's Hood! Shoot!

61
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,979
Robin.

62
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,534
Ah! My tooth!

63
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,495
Where 's my tooth?

64
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,971
Gisborne! Where 's my tooth?

65
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:07,575
What is this? Hood does not kill.

66
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,375
Do not shoot!

67
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,139
Sir Guy! It's me.

68
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,733
- Move.
- Sir Guy.

69
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,459
- Kill him.
- I have always served you well.

70
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,292
You've served your purpose. Kill him!

71
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,576
You're learning.

72
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,932
Second line forward.

73
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,452
It's a good day.

74
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,291
Come on, then!

75
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,610
What is this? Is this suicide?

76
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:20,171
We fight for Robin Hood and King Richard!

77
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:44,329
Allan.

78
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:49,099
- Do something, Gisborne.
- Regroup.

79
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,654
Allan.

80
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,218
Get me out of here.

81
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,938
Robin Hood and King Richard!

82
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,939
Get me out of here.

83
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,255
Move back!

84
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,493
Those blithering idiots cost me my tooth!

85
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,973
Where were you two?

86
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,419
I can explain.

87
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,776
It's a woman, a mother, she was giving birth
to this newborn babe, right?

88
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:59,170
We were going to take the haul.
Gisborne's money.

89
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,773
We were going to take it to Scarborough.

90
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:13,176
- Yeah. What can I say?
- Sorry.

91
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,929
Really.

92
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:22,899
Well, we're here now.
Saved your bacon, actually.

93
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,095
What?

94
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,098
We said sorry.

95
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:36,014
Marian. Gisborne stabbed her last night.

96
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:41,139
- And she's...
- She's dead.

97
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,816
Marian's dead.

98
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,814
We need to bury her.

99
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,336
We must take her to Knighton Hall,
to her father.

100
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:18,656
John, I want you to...

101
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,616
Djaq, prepare her body.

102
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,255
Will, I need you to make...

103
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,808
- I need you to make a coffin.
- Shh.

104
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,528
In good time.

105
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:41,056
First... we say goodbye.

106
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,060
She was a good woman.

107
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,538
Kind and considerate.

108
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,052
Good?

109
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,856
Oh, she was...

110
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,736
She was...

111
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,779
She was all right.

112
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,771
Yeah.

113
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,379
Her, we liked.

114
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,849
Her we loved.

115
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,532
Her I loved.

116
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,496
- I loved her and I never told her.
- Well, she knew.

117
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:32,212
We all knew.

118
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,729
I'm not being funny, right.
She's breathing.

119
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,493
- On the blade. She is breathing.
- Eh? Told you.

120
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,251
- What?
- The physician's draught.

121
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:02,777
I have heard of this before. Hemlock.
Too much and the body freezes.

122
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:06,415
The breathing stops.

123
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:10,618
But if one is young and strong,
the body fights back.

124
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:14,249
- Comes back from the dead!
- She died?

125
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,900
And came back!

126
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,971
That is...

127
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:25,652
Marian? Marian?

128
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,899
Marian?

129
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,293
Where have I been?

130
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,579
I don't know, but I'm glad you're back.

131
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:46,618
It would have been nice to have dealt with
Robin Hood before the King returns.

132
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,850
What?

133
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,812
The King is not coming.

134
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,252
What do you mean, the King is not coming?

135
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,332
He is in the Holy Land.

136
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:03,256
I have arranged an impostor.
Think about it.

137
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,935
Is the real King, who spent God knows how long
fighting in the Holy Land,

138
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,851
going to stop off in Nottingham for a chat?

139
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,329
- A clue, no.
- Why?

140
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:15,174
How many of our friends are against us?
Our pathetic lords.

141
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:18,172
Merton, Woodvale, Edward.
How many of them are scheming?

142
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,332
Smiling at us, lying, biding their time,
nodding their heads,

143
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:25,015
all the while preparing for the return
of the precious Richard the Lionheart.

144
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:28,490
Preparing to turn against us
the minute he walks through that door.

145
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,253
- I don't know.
- None of them have ever seen the King.

146
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,615
So, this way we find out, hm?

147
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,497
The plots bubble to the surface.

148
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,855
The rats come scurrying
out of the woodwork.

149
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,173
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, sorry. Nothing personal. Hm?

150
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,251
You should thank me.
You get to marry the girl.

151
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:49,015
Yeah. But based on a lie.
The King is not really coming.

152
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,092
Isn't that despicable?
How could you live with yourself?

153
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:57,975
- What if Edward is one of them?
- I will hang him!

154
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,649
Swap.

155
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:37,819
- Robin, this is my fault.
- No. It was the Sheriff and Gisborne's.

156
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,929
When the King returns, the Sheriff
will make his move. You know that?

157
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,534
He will try to kill the King.
Help me stop him.

158
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:50,249
My daughter' s wedding takes place
in Locksley on Saturday.

159
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,934
At the same time the Sheriff
will meet the King in Nottingham.

160
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,932
Maybe he's thinking I and others
will attend the wedding

161
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,409
and leave him free to assassinate the King.

162
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:00,377
But we must forget the wedding.

163
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:04,976
- We must be in Nottingham.
- We? I don't think so.

164
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:06,937
You, me and a number of loyal nobles.

165
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:13,608
Now is the time to act.
To stand up and defend our King.

166
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,850
- Join us.
- What about Marian?

167
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:20,690
She cannot be left
to meet Gisborne at the altar.

168
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,293
Gisborne!

169
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,291
I'll get rid of him.

170
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,454
Sir Guy.

171
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,930
- I need to speak to Marian.
- She's indisposed.

172
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:42,739
- Indisposed?
- Sleeping.

173
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:46,772
- At this hour?
- She is unwell.

174
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,612
- She's not here.
- She is here.

175
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,657
I knew it.

176
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,733
I knew she would not keep her promise.
She cannot run from me.

177
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:00,938
- Sir Guy, I assure you that...
- Do not "Sir Guy" me.

178
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,534
- Where is she?
- She has been injured.

179
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,690
I do not know how.
Perhaps a fall in the woods.

180
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,453
- Don't lie to me.
- I am not lying.

181
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,414
- Ah.
- I told you.

182
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,574
She looks pale. Marian?

183
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,416
Shh. It's all right. It's only me.

184
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,935
She is unwell.
I will send for a physician.

185
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:45,695
No need. I'm sure rest and recuperation...

186
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:50,698
Perhaps the excitement of the wedding.

187
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,658
Is that true? The wedding excites her?

188
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,650
- You wanted to tell her something.
- Yes.

189
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,049
Tell her I am also...

190
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,776
Goodbye.

191
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,532
Goodbye, Sir Guy.

192
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:24,135
"I will send for a physician."
He just killed one. He is revolting.

193
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:30,493
- He killed one?
- Yes.

194
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,536
Pitts.

195
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,855
We thought he would denounce Gisborne.
But he was a traitor.

196
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,773
He was also revolting.
I'm glad he is dead.

197
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,896
Yeah, but she's got to marry Gisborne now.

198
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,017
- Tomorrow.
- True.

199
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,452
Marian, I will find another way out of this.

200
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,815
Robin, I need to speak to you.

201
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,330
Do you really have another way out for Marian?

202
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,978
I will think of something.

203
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:09,290
If you cannot stop it,
then do not speak of it.

204
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:12,816
Once Marian is married
it can never be undone.

205
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,856
Then what is your plan?

206
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,213
Edward, I will think of something.

207
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,576
No. That is not good enough.

208
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,970
You will raise Marian's hopes
only to see them dashed.

209
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,415
If you care about her, spare her that.

210
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,095
If you cannot save her, I beg you,
do the right thing. Let her go.

211
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,175
Do you know something?

212
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,013
I am sick of doing the right thing.

213
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,816
Robin.

214
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,970
I need your help.

215
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,375
Robin.

216
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,256
I knew you'd be here.

217
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,296
It is my village.

218
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,939
Remember the times
we used to sit up here?

219
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:20,693
Sit up here and say there was
no finer place in England.

220
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:24,376
Gisborne is stealing my life.

221
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,570
Then you must let him.

222
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,890
You heard Edward.

223
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,130
The King is in danger.

224
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,576
What is Locksley
if England can't be saved?

225
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,891
At this moment I care more
about Locksley than England.

226
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:48,016
It isn't Locksley, is it?

227
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:50,288
It's Marian.

228
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,092
We must let her go.

229
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,176
I say "we". I mean you.

230
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,092
There must be a way.

231
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,010
Robin, the King is coming back.

232
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,368
And if we can stop the Sheriff
from messing things up,

233
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,212
then England will be right again.

234
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,448
- Will it?
- Yes.

235
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,692
The Sheriff will be out. You'll be in.

236
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:25,296
We're talking days, surely.
I mean, you'll have your lands back.

237
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,536
You'll be in Locksley,

238
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,173
I'll be in Bonchurch.

239
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,694
It's not a huge estate but it's big enough.

240
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:38,253
A man could easily get lost on it. Easily.

241
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,738
You know something?

242
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,776
If you want to get lost...

243
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,976
why don't you start practicing now?

244
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,331
You don't mean that.

245
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,291
A smaller man would be offended.
A smaller man would be wounded.

246
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,575
You see, there is no smaller man, Much.

247
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,618
You are the smaller man.

248
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:12,649
All you care about is the roof
over your head, the food in your belly.

249
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:17,096
You speak every facile thought
that comes into your head.

250
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:21,650
You're like a pox on my skin.

251
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:28,176
I keep scratching but you never go away.

252
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,136
You go away!

253
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,210
Marian.

254
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,178
What is happening with Merton
and the other nobles?

255
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,218
They are ready, making preparations.

256
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,053
- Will you get word to the King?
- If we can.

257
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,018
If not, we will protect him
as he arrives in Nottingham.

258
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,931
It is so dangerous.

259
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,693
Any move against the Sheriff,
if you were to be caught...

260
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,176
I have waited too long, Marian.

261
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:30,650
- And Robin?
- What of him?

262
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,618
He used to be in charge
of the King's Private Guard.

263
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,612
- He will assist you.
- I think not.

264
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,578
- Why?
- He wants to stop your wedding.

265
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,416
- He cannot.
- I have told him.

266
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,975
Do you believe
Gisborne went to the Holy Land?

267
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,018
Tried to kill the King? Attacked Robin?

268
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,852
I do not know what to believe anymore.

269
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,776
- Will you take me to him?
- Robin?

270
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,579
No, Gisborne. I need to ask him.

271
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:13,293
Get out and scour the country
for the Nightwatchman.

272
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,689
I want him found by sunset.

273
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,899
- Marian.
- I am quite well.

274
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,290
Er, a robbery. A small thing.

275
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,656
But I've taken extra precautions.
You're entirely safe.

276
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:30,174
I hope you have not lost anything important.

277
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,613
I'll get it back.

278
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,970
Sir Guy, I must ask you a difficult question.

279
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,539
I'm intrigued.

280
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,300
Did you try and kill the King in the Holy Land?

281
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:49,009
- Pardon?
- Is it true?

282
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:53,256
That last year you were not
in quarantine with a fever

283
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,253
but that you traveled to the Holy Land,
you and others dressed as Saracens,

284
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,217
and tried to kill the King?

285
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:04,258
- Robin Hood.
- What of him?

286
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:06,490
Been talking to him?

287
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,936
This is a rumor which has been circulating
and I need an answer.

288
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,414
I could not marry you if it were true.

289
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:16,298
Rumors, Marian.

290
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:23,288
You need to be more careful
who you listen to.

291
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,132
The day the King returns is a day of joy for me.

292
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:33,610
- It is the day that I marry you.
- I am not sure.

293
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,215
Well, you must be sure.

294
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:41,334
- But...
- Have you not seen what you do to me?

295
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,340
My passion for you?

296
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,773
I have never felt like this before.

297
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,418
- I must go.
- Stay.

298
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:02,528
- I must go.
- Not until you tell me you believe me.

299
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,256
I believe you.

300
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,489
How are you feeling?

301
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:30,899
I've been to see Guy.

302
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,208
I've challenged him.

303
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,256
And let me guess.

304
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:42,172
You asked him if he was a traitor,
he said he wasn't and you believed him.

305
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,694
Yes.

306
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,738
I think you've been wrong about him.

307
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,132
No. Trust me. I've been right about him.

308
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:56,212
Maybe the difference between you and he
is not so huge.

309
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,536
And isn't that your thesis?

310
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,818
- Isn't that the Robin Hood world view?
- What thesis?

311
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,289
That one man is much like another.

312
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,975
That the poor are no different
from the wealthy and just as deserving.

313
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,369
Why can't you apply your charitable principles

314
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,974
to somebody who's been deprived
in a different way?

315
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,176
Deprived of love.

316
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,372
Deprived of love.

317
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,936
The Nightwatchman.

318
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,852
This is goodbye, Robin.

319
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:45,578
It's time for us to both grow up
and accept our lot in life.

320
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:50,813
- Are you marrying him?
- I am marrying him.

321
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,490
- Very well.
- Pardon?

322
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,175
You said grow up and I'm growing up.

323
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,656
Robin, where are you going?

324
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,616
Arms. What about weapons?

325
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,852
We will make sure all our men are armed
under their cloaks.

326
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,534
I will alert the King's Private Guard
as best I can.

327
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:21,374
I am anxious.
What if the Sheriff is planning...

328
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,499
Remember, the Sheriff
will try to kill the King tomorrow.

329
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,970
We will have the King's Private Guard
on our side.

330
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,575
And not just that.
We will have right on our side.

331
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,173
Justice.

332
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,649
My lords, we have been biding our time
for too long.

333
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,576
We are Robin Hood's men,
here to protect the King.

334
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,616
Let them in. They are Robin's men.

335
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,056
We can trust them.
Much served the King in Antioch.

336
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:58,370
Welcome, Much. Robin is not with you?

337
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:02,499
Robin is... by himself.

338
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,298
There is no Robin.

339
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:47,335
- Master? About your family.
- I have no family, Thornton.

340
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,656
Thornton.

341
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,249
Are you married?

342
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,570
Alas, my wife has died, sir.

343
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,416
Did she understand you?

344
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,096
I... think so, sir. Yes.

345
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,011
- That is the thing, to be understood.
- Yes, indeed, sir.

346
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,449
- I have committed crimes.
- Really?

347
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,495
Heinous crimes.

348
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:30,977
But by taking Marian in holy wedlock...
I will wash away those crimes.

349
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,735
Her pure heart... will cleanse mine.

350
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,737
- Be careful.
- I will.

351
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,288
I hope the decorations... the church...
please you.

352
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,335
They do.

353
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,979
- I hope I please you.
- You should not be here.

354
00:29:58,660 --> 00:29:59,809
Who should be here?

355
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:03,097
You should be inside the church waiting for me.

356
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:06,172
Oh. Forgive me, I was unaware.

357
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,013
- Have you never been to a wedding?
- No.

358
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,136
Well, wait inside for me.

359
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,856
Marian.

360
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,215
I have dreamed of this day.

361
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,255
Go.

362
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,659
Sir Edward?

363
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,493
He was needed on business.
He sends his apologies.

364
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:34,094
What?

365
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,936
Nothing.

366
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,330
This is strange, the gang without Robin.

367
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:14,858
It's fine.
He's made his decision. It's fine.

368
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,977
What are you doing?

369
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:23,809
There 's something I have to do.
I must find Robin.

370
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,655
Come on. It's up to us.

371
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,816
Majesty.

372
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:05,900
Ha! Whoa! Your Majesty, welcome home.

373
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,857
Wait!

374
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,179
I'm Much.

375
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:15,411
I fought in the King's Guard. I'm...
Your Ma...!

376
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,573
Edward.

377
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,616
Marian.

378
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,051
Your Majesty.

379
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,852
Welcome to Nottinghamshire,
the King's own county.

380
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,659
We are glad to be back on English soil.

381
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,696
I'm sure we are.

382
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,256
My loyal subjects...

383
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,980
we have survived the Holy Land

384
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:29,413
and we are grateful
for your warm welcome.

385
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:36,610
However, there are those amongst us
who are disloyal,

386
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,168
who would plot against authority,

387
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:46,611
who do not understand law and order.

388
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,370
We must quash them now.

389
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,618
Arrest Sheriff Vaizey.

390
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,653
- Me?
- Take him to the dungeons.

391
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,779
Me? Me? Blithering oaf! Me, arrested?

392
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:11,250
Arrest all of them. Idiotic buffoon!

393
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:47,779
Good subjects, we must judge the Sheriff
according to law.

394
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:53,412
In such a case we shall hear French evidence.

395
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:57,129
French evidence? What?

396
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,815
Walter Lord of Merton.

397
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,895
Walter, Lord of Merton,

398
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:37,575
go left, à gauche,
to give evidence for the Sheriff,

399
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:42,051
go right, à droit,
to give evidence against the Sheriff.

400
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,495
Do you wish to give evidence
against the Sheriff?

401
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,695
I do.

402
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:56,577
Good. God save the King.

403
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:06,694
Stop the wedding! Stop the wedding!

404
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,333
Stop the wedding! It's not the King!

405
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,570
The King is an impostor!

406
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:18,538
The King is not in Nottingham!

407
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:23,057
Whether the King is in Nottingham or not,
that has no bearing on a wedding.

408
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:27,019
- Did you know this?
- The priest is right.

409
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,056
This makes no difference. Our happiness...

410
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:32,132
You lied to me.
What else have you lied about?

411
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,292
He went to the Holy Land!
He tried to kill the King!

412
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,419
I have done wrong
but you will wash away my sins.

413
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,649
If it is not the King?

414
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,732
It is a ruse by the Sheriff
to flush out his enemies.

415
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:46,732
What will happen to them?

416
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,617
My father. I must go to Nottingham.

417
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:52,168
Your father will be safe.
I have made provision.

418
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:55,809
You see? My influence, it benefits you.

419
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,016
As my father-in-law, he is protected.

420
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,651
As my father-in-law.

421
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,413
- You are cruel.
- This is wrong!

422
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:07,175
You must have legal grounds to object
or remain silent.

423
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,296
- I have moral grounds.
- Get him out of here!

424
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:15,569
This man is a traitor and a liar!
Is that legal?

425
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:18,652
And her heart belongs to another!

426
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,934
Let her tell you that.

427
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:32,420
Marian, my lady, tell them.

428
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,851
Yes, Marian, tell them.

429
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:42,651
Remember your father.

430
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:48,329
It is not true. I am sorry.

431
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:52,777
I know you mean well
but my heart belongs here.

432
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:57,893
- Get on with it.
- What? I don't understand!

433
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:01,298
This is surely some mistake!

434
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,489
You have a ring?

435
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:07,572
He needs you, Marian!

436
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,051
Wise decision. In time you will thank me.

437
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,935
No, the left hand.
The ring must go on the left hand.

438
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,329
No, the right is better.

439
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:40,693
Do you take this man and this horse
as your route out of here?

440
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:43,374
I do.

441
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,571
Master! T he King!

442
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:02,572
It's not the King! He's an impostor!

443
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,049
A trap. I knew it.

444
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,859
- Who's there?
- Everyone.

445
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,056
- The gang.
- Robin, my father.

446
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,176
He leads the rebellion.

447
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:28,013
Former Sheriff,
Edward of Knighton.

448
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,898
- Tell it how it is, Edward.
- I will.

449
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,850
We can catch her for you, sir.

450
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:48,216
No.

451
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:51,618
Let her go.

452
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,613
Lord Knighton, go left, à gauche,
to give evidence for the Sheriff,

453
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:19,933
go right, à droit,
to give evidence against the Sheriff.

454
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,849
- We can't be seen together.
- We'd never get in anyway.

455
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,171
- I'll try the east gate.
- We'll try the west.

456
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:37,331
- Marian!
- Robin!

457
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,656
Much.

458
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:21,297
Climbing. You know I hate climbing.

459
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:42,299
Do you wish to give evidence
against the Sheriff?

460
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,978
A clue, no.

461
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,651
Help! Help!

462
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:04,169
It's a trap! It's a trap!

463
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,376
This is not the King!

464
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,132
Arrest that impostor!

465
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,336
I knew this smelt funny.

466
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,775
- Get him.
- Run!

467
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,173
It's not funny.

468
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,534
No.

469
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,611
Shall we leave?

470
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:31,897
- Thought we were out of a job.
- Good to have you back.

471
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,333
It's good to be back.

472
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,735
Robin!

473
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,776
Not so fast, my friend.

474
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,375
Sorry to burst your bubble, Hood,

475
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,896
but I'm sure you know how this goes, hm?

476
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:47,129
Hands up.

477
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:51,210
- Spoilt my game, Hood. Tut-tut.
- John, catch!

478
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,256
Everybody still, if you please.

479
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:20,810
I think we can safely say

480
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:23,334
an audience with the King...

481
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,058
has been suspended.

482
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,811
Come on, lads. Let's go home.

483
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,535
Come back!

484
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:37,134
Get me down from here, you blithering oafs!

485
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,492
Yeah!
