1
00:00:07,998 --> 00:00:09,109
Excuse me.

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,553
Guy, there's a messenger
outside with a letter.

3
00:00:14,673 --> 00:00:17,434
He's insisting he gives it to
the Lord Of The Manor in person.

4
00:00:17,554 --> 00:00:21,149
- Is it from Lady Marian?
- No, he says it's from the King.

5
00:00:22,007 --> 00:00:23,101
The King?

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,727
So where is he, then?

7
00:00:28,494 --> 00:00:29,957
Well, he was here a minute ago.

8
00:00:30,077 --> 00:00:32,255
He thought Robin was still
Lord Of The Manor.

9
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:34,177
Maybe he found out he wasn't
and ran off.

10
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:37,879
- And what fool told him that?
- It's not a secte, is it?

11
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,040
Fool!

12
00:00:39,426 --> 00:00:41,450
- Get after him! I want that letter!
- Yeah.

13
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,737
Yeah. He won't get far.
He's only on foot. Ha!

14
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:46,848
Hey. Guards, come on!

15
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:50,697
Happy Birthday, Gisborne.

16
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:53,839
- Party going well, is it?
- We've got a problem.

17
00:01:02,045 --> 00:01:04,400
Just give us the letter and
we'll let you go, all right?

18
00:01:25,538 --> 00:01:26,909
<i>Oi! Over 'ere.</i>

19
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,991
<i>Come along!</i>

20
00:01:29,784 --> 00:01:32,599
<i>Look, you've got the most
distinctive tracks in the forest.</i>

21
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,239
<i>- You might as well give up now!
- This way!</i>

22
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,217
Give us the message from the King.

23
00:02:26,337 --> 00:02:28,452
It's for Robin Of
Locksley and his eyes only.

24
00:02:28,572 --> 00:02:31,322
Just give it to me
or we'll take it from you.

25
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:42,039
Don't you know it's rude
to read other people's mail?!

26
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,680
Sub Wood Team
http://subwoodteam.free.fr/forum/

27
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,964
Moochie

28
00:03:23,121 --> 00:03:25,933
By the time you get close
enough to use those swords,

29
00:03:26,053 --> 00:03:29,090
you'll be so full of arrows,
you'll look like hedgehogs.

30
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:35,099
So...

31
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,281
This is what Gisborne's
dogsbody does, is it?

32
00:03:38,401 --> 00:03:41,428
I'm not his dogsbody.
I'm his right-hand man.

33
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:45,199
I couldn't face myself in the morning,

34
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,679
- if I was you.
- I count my money in the morning.

35
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:50,400
While you are squabbling,
there's a man in agony over there.

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,837
Run back to your master.

37
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:54,180
Go on.

38
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:56,665
Go on!

39
00:03:58,405 --> 00:03:59,464
RUN!

40
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:03,200
Do you practise
little speeches like that?

41
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,344
Like what?

42
00:04:04,464 --> 00:04:07,237
"You'll be so full of arrows,
you'll look like hedgehogs."

43
00:04:07,357 --> 00:04:10,277
- No, it just came to mind.
- You practise, don't you?

44
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:11,239
No.

45
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,508
- Robin...
- Ssh-sh-sh-sh.

46
00:04:15,193 --> 00:04:16,282
I know you.

47
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:19,938
Save your strength.

48
00:04:20,606 --> 00:04:21,719
Lardner...

49
00:04:24,841 --> 00:04:25,926
Lardner!

50
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:36,573
It's the royal seal. It is from Richard.

51
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:41,817
So, where are they, Gisborne?

52
00:04:41,937 --> 00:04:44,677
- They'll be here.
- Woodcock, Sir Guy.

53
00:04:44,797 --> 00:04:46,075
Birthday treat.

54
00:04:47,565 --> 00:04:48,953
Shall I get started?

55
00:04:49,574 --> 00:04:50,625
If you must.

56
00:04:50,755 --> 00:04:53,759
Your men had better get
to him before Robin does.

57
00:04:57,859 --> 00:04:59,657
He wants reinforcements.

58
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,471
He wants more men.

59
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:05,159
He still has got no idea. He has
no idea what's happening in England.

60
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,334
The message you sent with Carter.
It can't have reached the King yet.

61
00:05:08,454 --> 00:05:11,977
Many a courier gets intercepted.
The proof of that's right here.

62
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,297
He wants me to send...

63
00:05:14,667 --> 00:05:16,740
a note back with... Lardner,

64
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,959
telling him how many men
I can recruit and when I'll arrive.

65
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,938
Well, you can't do that now, can you ?

66
00:05:23,546 --> 00:05:24,560
But...

67
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:27,520
This... This isn't Lardner. This...

68
00:05:28,193 --> 00:05:30,444
This is McLellan.
This is Lawrence McLellan.

69
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:32,523
Well, then who's Lardner?

70
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:41,217
Richard The Lionheart, they call him.

71
00:05:42,248 --> 00:05:44,310
Going into battle in a foreign land,

72
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:46,639
it's not the heart
of a lion you want, is it?

73
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:50,577
Since when did a heart hurt anybody?

74
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,908
Come on then! Come on!

75
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,698
I've got the heart of a lion!

76
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:02,377
You can imagine the Saracens
translating that, can't you?

77
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,890
He's got the what of a lion? The teeth?

78
00:06:08,584 --> 00:06:09,600
The jaws?

79
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:11,026
The claws?

80
00:06:13,213 --> 00:06:15,482
No! The heart!

81
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:19,177
Richard The Lion Claw,
Jerusalem's yours.

82
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,576
Come in. Sit down. Help yourself!

83
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:23,978
Lion Heart?

84
00:06:26,417 --> 00:06:28,479
- It's good, very good.
- Forget about it.

85
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:31,977
It's no wonder it's taking
him so long over there, is it?

86
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:38,011
Mind you, mind you...

87
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,457
It's better than his brother, isn't it?

88
00:06:41,773 --> 00:06:43,030
Prince John.

89
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:45,817
What's Prince John doing?

90
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,137
Sitting at home, heart of a dormouse?

91
00:06:49,546 --> 00:06:51,750
Prince John is a friend of mine!

92
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:53,745
It's a joke. It's what I do.

93
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:55,999
I do other things.
Let's try some soothsaying.

94
00:06:56,161 --> 00:06:59,880
Sit down. I'll make some predictions
and then I'll make them come true.

95
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:03,512
Someone in this room will bare
their buttocks to the Sheriff tonight.

96
00:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,560
Take that man to the dungeons now!

97
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,667
No, hang on. Prediction two, Sir
Guy's joint will rise from the dead.

98
00:07:09,787 --> 00:07:12,838
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Your woodcock, Sir Guy,

99
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:15,039
- I can bring it back to life.
- Get rid of him!

100
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,199
My third prediction's about Prince John.

101
00:07:17,361 --> 00:07:19,326
One day Prince John
will be King of England.

102
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:20,598
I know that already.

103
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:22,995
But did you know something
in Nottingham can stop him?

104
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:25,577
- Like what?
- Lardner's Ring.

105
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:30,017
- What is Lardner's Ring?
- Well, let me go and I'll tell you.

106
00:07:30,137 --> 00:07:32,993
Lock him in the cell overnight,
flog him in the morning

107
00:07:33,113 --> 00:07:36,561
and then he'll tell us.
Now that really is funny!

108
00:07:39,281 --> 00:07:41,719
You should listen to me!
I know what I'm talking about.

109
00:07:44,955 --> 00:07:48,743
The first prediction! I told you!
And the others will follow.

110
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:51,439
Beware the power of Lardner's Ring.

111
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:54,919
What is Lardner's Ring?

112
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,840
I know I'm meant to be loyal
and obedient, but

113
00:08:05,885 --> 00:08:07,811
the King doesn't know the facts.

114
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:10,137
And once he does, then he'll turn home.

115
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:14,007
And this is no time for you
to go back to the Holy Land.

116
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:16,668
We're agreed then.

117
00:08:20,798 --> 00:08:21,845
Absolutely.

118
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:33,159
Would you like to say a few words?

119
00:08:41,582 --> 00:08:42,639
Go on then.

120
00:08:46,463 --> 00:08:47,839
Will you marry me?

121
00:08:50,258 --> 00:08:51,294
What?

122
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,479
The first time I held my bow, I knew.

123
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:05,610
It felt right.

124
00:09:06,735 --> 00:09:08,480
Like it had been made for me.

125
00:09:10,937 --> 00:09:13,040
And that's how I feel about you.

126
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:19,286
I promised your father
I would protect and look after you.

127
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:24,189
But it works both ways.

128
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:29,198
I look after my bow because
it protects and looks after me.

129
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,279
Together we're stronger.

130
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,026
So...

131
00:09:54,238 --> 00:09:55,239
Marian.

132
00:09:56,142 --> 00:09:57,464
Will you marry me?

133
00:10:03,124 --> 00:10:05,743
Robin, of every single man in the world,

134
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:09,909
- you are the only one...
- Is that a yes?

135
00:10:10,029 --> 00:10:12,935
- Will you let me finish?
- I'm sorry.

136
00:10:14,275 --> 00:10:16,232
The only one who would

137
00:10:16,972 --> 00:10:18,038
propose

138
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:19,932
over a fresh grave

139
00:10:20,795 --> 00:10:24,011
- by comparing me to your weapon.
- Well, is that a no?

140
00:10:25,403 --> 00:10:28,133
- Who will give me away?
- I can ask the King.

141
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:35,117
So we find Lardner
and bring the King home.

142
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:38,420
Defeat the Sheriff

143
00:10:40,164 --> 00:10:41,839
and then we get married.

144
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,479
That sounds like a plan.

145
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,586
Move, you worm!

146
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,396
Right.

147
00:11:08,968 --> 00:11:10,128
What's that?!

148
00:11:11,305 --> 00:11:12,337
It's a dove.

149
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:14,537
Well, I've seen it all now!

150
00:11:18,306 --> 00:11:20,997
Here, why do you keep
a bird in your pocket?

151
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:24,817
Why do you keep a worm in your pants?

152
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,039
You should keep an eye
on that belt of yours!

153
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:38,484
Where is he?

154
00:11:39,795 --> 00:11:41,850
- He's dead.
- What about the message?

155
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,403
Well, we got part of it, yeah.

156
00:11:43,917 --> 00:11:46,206
- But Robin turned up...
- Turned up?!

157
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:49,886
- And got his message?
- I don't know.

158
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:52,359
Look, he kinda took us by surprise.

159
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,439
All we heard him say
was "Lardner", that was it.

160
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,653
Lardner. That's what he said.

161
00:12:05,161 --> 00:12:06,951
I blame you for this!

162
00:12:07,788 --> 00:12:10,841
You had him on your doorstep
and you let him escape?!

163
00:12:11,441 --> 00:12:13,039
You and your imbeciles!

164
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:14,621
Six legs

165
00:12:15,001 --> 00:12:17,597
against one and the one

166
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,170
got away!

167
00:12:33,175 --> 00:12:34,737
There's an explanation.

168
00:12:35,075 --> 00:12:37,964
There is always a rational explanation.

169
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,542
We know McLellan
and the Fool spoke together,

170
00:12:44,662 --> 00:12:47,347
so something was said
about the ring of Lardner.

171
00:12:47,467 --> 00:12:49,209
Maybe it's got
a coded inscription on it.

172
00:12:49,329 --> 00:12:50,397
It's no problem.

173
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:53,805
We'll just torture the Fool
until he tells us.

174
00:12:55,074 --> 00:12:56,446
He's disappeared!

175
00:12:59,841 --> 00:13:02,191
I know that, you blithering oaf!

176
00:13:15,917 --> 00:13:18,667
Know anyone called Lardner?

177
00:13:19,592 --> 00:13:20,920
Have you ever known

178
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,670
or heard of anyone

179
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:26,262
or anything called Lardner?

180
00:13:29,121 --> 00:13:31,959
Lardner's Ring?
What is it? What is it?

181
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,079
Tell us where it is or we will take

182
00:13:39,365 --> 00:13:41,913
every ring in this village.

183
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:48,050
- It must be some kind of ring tax.
- Allan's with them.

184
00:13:51,024 --> 00:13:53,995
Leave me alone! I don't know anything.

185
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:59,639
Right, you've had your chance.
Lose the ring

186
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:01,614
or lose the finger.

187
00:14:02,444 --> 00:14:05,301
Somebody knows where Lardner is.

188
00:14:05,843 --> 00:14:09,039
- Did he say Lardner?
- Does that mean something to you?

189
00:14:09,838 --> 00:14:10,880
So,

190
00:14:11,513 --> 00:14:13,079
when the sand runs out...

191
00:14:14,765 --> 00:14:16,817
the finger... comes off!

192
00:14:20,157 --> 00:14:22,856
Much, when we were in the Holy Land,

193
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,199
do you remember anybody called Lardner?

194
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,839
- No. Why?
- Because I have to find him.

195
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,701
Where's, er... Where's Will and Djaq?

196
00:14:33,064 --> 00:14:35,679
They said
they've gone to get some honey.

197
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:39,260
- They'll be back soon.
- If that's what they've gone for.

198
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:41,940
But why does it need two of them?

199
00:14:42,315 --> 00:14:44,279
Honey is one of those things.

200
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,643
- What things?
- What do you call it when you use

201
00:14:47,763 --> 00:14:50,280
a sweet innocent word but what
you really mean is something else?

202
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,999
- A lie.
- No.

203
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:54,482
- A euphemism?
- A euphemism.

204
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:56,319
Exactly!

205
00:14:57,095 --> 00:15:00,687
Yes. There's a bit too much honey
going on around here if you ask me.

206
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,311
Will and Djaq nipping off together.

207
00:15:03,431 --> 00:15:06,081
You two going for long walks
in the forest.

208
00:15:06,256 --> 00:15:07,453
He's jealous.

209
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,492
What happened to fighting for justice
and rebelling against the Sheriff?

210
00:15:11,726 --> 00:15:13,750
We should be sticking together!

211
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,245
Instead, we're splitting into couples.

212
00:15:17,047 --> 00:15:18,794
To be perfectly honest...

213
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:21,519
I don't fancy mine much.

214
00:15:23,867 --> 00:15:26,257
Anyway, while you two
have been off gallivanting...

215
00:15:26,377 --> 00:15:28,417
We haven't been gallivanting!

216
00:15:28,537 --> 00:15:29,919
I know what you've been up to.

217
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:32,199
We've been burying
a corpse in the forest.

218
00:15:35,179 --> 00:15:36,828
Is that a euphemism?

219
00:15:41,392 --> 00:15:43,679
Speak now and spare this woman's finger.

220
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:47,631
Say nothing and your silence
proves your guilt.

221
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:50,857
- Can we risk it?
- Yeah, we have to.

222
00:15:50,977 --> 00:15:53,839
I'll take him the long way round,
lead him away from camp.

223
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,653
Stop!

224
00:15:57,585 --> 00:15:59,137
I know who Lardner is.

225
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:01,120
And I know about his ring.

226
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:04,559
- Let the woman go.
- You're in Robin Hood's gang?

227
00:16:04,721 --> 00:16:06,471
Let the woman go!

228
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,036
Now...

229
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:13,879
tell me about Lardner.

230
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:16,977
You'll have to catch us first!

231
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,618
Get after 'em!

232
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,059
That way!

233
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:19,881
Whoa! Whoa! Hold there, horsey!

234
00:17:20,586 --> 00:17:22,781
This is my lucky day, this is !

235
00:17:27,236 --> 00:17:28,809
Or it was.

236
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:33,566
Robin?

237
00:17:34,904 --> 00:17:36,678
- What's happened?
- It's Gisborne.

238
00:17:36,798 --> 00:17:38,994
He's at Locksley,
terrorising the people.

239
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:41,768
- What?
- He's searching for Lardner's Ring.

240
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,557
Gisborne The Gullible.
I've got something to show you.

241
00:17:49,393 --> 00:17:51,417
First you see it, then you don't.

242
00:17:51,537 --> 00:17:54,767
- There it is. And there it isn't.
- What's your point?

243
00:17:58,471 --> 00:18:00,121
How did you do that?

244
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,040
You simply pull up on the handle,
the claw grabs hold of the bird.

245
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,183
You lift up the lid, the bird's gone.

246
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,453
The cooked bird has been
hollowed out, you put a live dove

247
00:18:13,573 --> 00:18:15,939
inside it and lah di dah di dah...

248
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:17,927
A plate full of bird's wings.

249
00:18:18,047 --> 00:18:21,597
Your Fool, he's no sorcerer,
he's no soothsayer.

250
00:18:21,717 --> 00:18:23,622
And he cannot predict the future.

251
00:18:23,742 --> 00:18:25,957
He was right about
Lardner's Ring though.

252
00:18:26,077 --> 00:18:27,405
Bring 'em in!

253
00:18:38,064 --> 00:18:40,517
Back home, my uncle had a friend.

254
00:18:40,721 --> 00:18:43,107
The Sultan's official pigeon handler.

255
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:45,479
He handles pigeons?

256
00:18:45,641 --> 00:18:49,160
- Yes, he handles pigeons.
- A job, I suppose.

257
00:18:49,736 --> 00:18:52,159
It's a very important job, Much!

258
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:57,085
Now, the Sultan's very best pigeon,

259
00:18:57,884 --> 00:18:59,034
the smallest

260
00:18:59,729 --> 00:19:01,079
and quickest one,

261
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,055
was a pigeon called Lardner.

262
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:07,731
Right.

263
00:19:09,117 --> 00:19:10,877
Right. Does he have a ring?

264
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,073
And if he does,
what's so special about it?

265
00:19:14,466 --> 00:19:17,399
The Saracens use
pigeons to carry messages.

266
00:19:17,561 --> 00:19:20,432
They put the message on a little
ring tied to the bird's foot

267
00:19:20,552 --> 00:19:22,130
and then they let it fly off.

268
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:24,923
It doesn't matter how far away the
bird is when you let it go,

269
00:19:25,043 --> 00:19:27,079
because it will always
find its way home.

270
00:19:27,507 --> 00:19:29,335
Carrying the message with it.

271
00:19:29,841 --> 00:19:32,524
But it isn't their home
they are searching for.

272
00:19:33,014 --> 00:19:34,582
It is their mate.

273
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:38,936
All you have to do
is split the two of them up.

274
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,767
And a pigeon

275
00:19:41,075 --> 00:19:44,035
will carry a message
to the ends of the Earth,

276
00:19:44,269 --> 00:19:46,958
faster and straighter
than any man ever could,

277
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:50,340
just to be with the one they love.

278
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:55,295
So we could get a message to King
Richard, half away across the world,

279
00:19:55,415 --> 00:19:58,199
- in no time at all?
- A matter of days.

280
00:19:59,777 --> 00:20:01,120
That's incredible!

281
00:20:01,835 --> 00:20:03,040
My question is,

282
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,500
why is the Sultan's best pigeon

283
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,324
being used by King Richard?

284
00:20:09,444 --> 00:20:11,604
Maybe they've formed an alliance
or something.

285
00:20:11,724 --> 00:20:13,531
Or maybe King Richard

286
00:20:13,843 --> 00:20:15,760
and his army have helped themselves.

287
00:20:17,497 --> 00:20:19,000
If they've got Lardner,

288
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:21,550
they've got the Sultan.

289
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,911
And if they've got the Sultan,

290
00:20:25,827 --> 00:20:27,394
they've got everyone.

291
00:20:34,563 --> 00:20:36,506
We have to go back to the tree.

292
00:20:37,161 --> 00:20:39,464
So that's what he had in his box.

293
00:20:39,584 --> 00:20:41,879
And the only place he
could've left it is up that tree.

294
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:45,570
You make me sick, you know that?
Betraying your old friends.

295
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,358
I hope you're enjoying it, Allan.
I couldn't live with myself.

296
00:20:49,478 --> 00:20:51,857
Ah well, you won't have to
for much longer, you see.

297
00:20:51,977 --> 00:20:55,807
The penalty for being
in Robin Hood's gang is death!

298
00:20:56,376 --> 00:20:59,136
Right, well. I'm glad I
could have been of service,

299
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:01,120
I think my work here is done.
Can I go now?

300
00:21:01,401 --> 00:21:03,453
You can go, of course. With him,

301
00:21:03,619 --> 00:21:05,880
to the gallows. Hang them both!

302
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:09,377
And feed their carcasses to the birds.

303
00:21:10,323 --> 00:21:12,637
Come along, Gisborne. No time to lose.

304
00:21:13,571 --> 00:21:16,440
No, please. Have mercy.
Don't let them do this to me!

305
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:23,533
I do comedy, I don't do tragedy.

306
00:21:23,653 --> 00:21:26,160
Please.

307
00:21:27,554 --> 00:21:28,635
Well, seeing you swing
will be comedy, won't it?

308
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:40,478
Very good.

309
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,866
If Robin gets the bird,
it means the King knows our plans.

310
00:21:43,986 --> 00:21:46,842
And the last thing we need
is the King and his army

311
00:21:47,335 --> 00:21:50,731
coming back to England
before we're ready for them.

312
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,413
So we must catch the pigeon.

313
00:22:00,837 --> 00:22:03,597
Catch the pigeon now.

314
00:22:03,717 --> 00:22:07,317
But if we wait for Will
then we can all go together!

315
00:22:07,437 --> 00:22:10,839
- We have to go now. Come on.
- And if Allan returns with more men?

316
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:14,399
If they knew where Lardner was, they
wouldn't have terrorised the village.

317
00:22:14,913 --> 00:22:15,974
We won't be long. Work on the message
until we get back. Now give me the rope.

318
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:50,079
Good luck.

319
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:53,005
Do you think a bird could fly that
distance and still find its way home?

320
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,689
The dove found its way back
to Noah's Ark.

321
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:59,319
How do they do it?

322
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:07,174
They just follow their hearts.

323
00:23:07,601 --> 00:23:09,466
Won't be long.

324
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:13,719
You take your time. No rush.

325
00:23:13,881 --> 00:23:15,837
Do you think that contraption's
strong enough to hold the us?

326
00:23:16,118 --> 00:23:18,319
Last a lifetime, that will.

327
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,797
Huh-heh! At least your lifetime!

328
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:24,325
I could do your job.

329
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:50,039
I couldn't do yours.

330
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,353
Can you see it?

331
00:23:58,115 --> 00:23:59,557
That's it, I think.

332
00:24:00,263 --> 00:24:01,520
Can you reach it?

333
00:24:08,243 --> 00:24:10,578
I'm nearly there.

334
00:24:16,184 --> 00:24:18,094
Robin! Robin, the Sheriff's coming.

335
00:24:21,999 --> 00:24:23,103
And Gisborne's with him!

336
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:25,824
Run!

337
00:24:30,211 --> 00:24:31,533
Go without me! I'll hold them off!

338
00:24:32,921 --> 00:24:34,409
Hang on, stop.

339
00:24:49,558 --> 00:24:51,141
Yeah, that's the tree.

340
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,197
You're surrounded, Hood!

341
00:24:53,401 --> 00:24:56,012
You're going nowhere!

342
00:25:00,546 --> 00:25:03,041
Get back on your horse
and get reinforcements!

343
00:25:04,155 --> 00:25:05,162
- What are you doing here?
- Hiding.

344
00:25:06,877 --> 00:25:09,908
Great!

345
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:12,092
He could just wait until it gets
dark and then release the bird.

346
00:25:14,167 --> 00:25:17,357
He'll be down before nightfall.

347
00:25:17,561 --> 00:25:20,287
"Come home."
No, it needs more immediacy.

348
00:25:21,886 --> 00:25:24,346
"Come home now".
"Come home immediately!"

349
00:25:24,466 --> 00:25:26,969
- "Immediately" is better.
- "Immediately" is longer.

350
00:25:27,089 --> 00:25:30,617
- What?!
- Lardner's a pigeon, not an eagle.

351
00:25:30,737 --> 00:25:33,481
- More words, more weight.
- It's one word. Same as "now"!

352
00:25:35,385 --> 00:25:37,725
- Well, then use "now"!
- Too many cooks!

353
00:25:37,845 --> 00:25:40,469
You know, traditionally,
men in your position

354
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:42,591
offer men in our position
a last request?

355
00:25:42,711 --> 00:25:45,917
I don't hold with tradition.

356
00:25:46,037 --> 00:25:48,050
It's just a little thing. Would you
scratch my nose? I've got an itch.

357
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:50,212
Let the Devil scratch it.

358
00:25:50,732 --> 00:25:53,039
You'll see him soon enough.

359
00:25:53,374 --> 00:25:55,855
Sir Guy's got Robin
Hood trapped up a tree.

360
00:25:56,281 --> 00:25:58,917
He wants every available
man down there now!

361
00:25:59,037 --> 00:26:02,000
- Get your horses! Quick!
- One last chance.

362
00:26:03,707 --> 00:26:05,137
While no-one's looking, let us go
and we'll say no more about it, yeah?

363
00:26:05,316 --> 00:26:07,677
I'm a performer!

364
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:09,757
I can't die without an audience.

365
00:26:11,823 --> 00:26:14,043
It's an insult to my profession.

366
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,429
I told you to keep an eye on that belt.

367
00:26:17,834 --> 00:26:20,962
Marian,

368
00:26:21,082 --> 00:26:24,178
they don't know you're up here. If I
make a run for it, they'll follow me.

369
00:26:45,841 --> 00:26:47,937
- You can escape with Lardner.
- They're coming back!

370
00:26:48,057 --> 00:26:49,869
That is a complete waste of arrows.

371
00:26:49,989 --> 00:26:52,080
Just giving Allan
something to think about.

372
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,240
Think about us !
We're running out of arrows.

373
00:26:59,178 --> 00:27:02,477
Look! Look, they're retreating.

374
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:06,422
I have an idea. Do not
let them escape while I'm gone.

375
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:14,777
- He'll be dead by the time you're back.
- I won't hold my breath.

376
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:17,913
Maybe you could use me as a hostage.

377
00:27:18,033 --> 00:27:21,199
- What?
- You know Gisborne's feelings for me.

378
00:27:21,337 --> 00:27:24,247
He might let you go, if he thought
it meant getting me back.

379
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:27,619
- Are you mad?
- I could say I was on my way to him

380
00:27:27,777 --> 00:27:31,000
- and you ambushed me in the forest.
- He'd never fall for it!

381
00:27:31,308 --> 00:27:33,904
And how would that look? Robin
Hood takes Lady Marian hostage!

382
00:27:34,149 --> 00:27:36,799
Oh, yes, us dying together
might look better!

383
00:27:36,979 --> 00:27:39,144
- But it won't bring the King home.
- Even if Gisborne fell for it,

384
00:27:39,264 --> 00:27:42,559
- the Sheriff wouldn't.
- The Sheriff's gone!

385
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:44,703
And while Gisborne's in charge...
Robin this could be our last chance.

386
00:27:45,112 --> 00:27:48,443
No! It's not happening.

387
00:27:51,121 --> 00:27:52,897
Robin, have you got a better idea?

388
00:27:53,417 --> 00:27:54,993
Right. "Your Majesty."

389
00:27:55,113 --> 00:27:58,240
"No reinforcements."

390
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:02,959
- "John plans to steal your throne..."
- "Plots."

391
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:08,148
- "Plots" is a better word.
- "Plots" is better.

392
00:28:08,377 --> 00:28:10,683
"Your Majesty. No reinforcements."

393
00:28:11,401 --> 00:28:13,840
"John plots to steal your throne."

394
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:17,817
"Come home, now."

395
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:20,960
Short, sharp and to the point.

396
00:28:21,644 --> 00:28:24,000
I'll add "make peace"
before "come home".

397
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:27,767
"Make peace immediately."

398
00:28:27,887 --> 00:28:31,657
You know, I do like "immediately".

399
00:28:31,881 --> 00:28:35,257
But it needs more emotion.
Make it bigger! Raise the stakes!

400
00:28:35,973 --> 00:28:39,177
And alliterate! Alliteration
makes it much more memorable.

401
00:28:39,297 --> 00:28:43,017
- Where have you come from?
- I appear. I disappear.

402
00:28:43,212 --> 00:28:44,577
It's what I do.
To tell how would spoil the illusion.

403
00:28:45,631 --> 00:28:47,865
He's with me.

404
00:28:47,985 --> 00:28:50,364
- I thought you'd been caught.
- Madam,

405
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,679
manacles are mere mist
to myself and my...

406
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,142
my mate.

407
00:28:55,262 --> 00:28:58,675
- You know about the pigeon?
- Yes,

408
00:28:58,795 --> 00:29:01,369
- Robin and Marian have gone to get him.
- So have Sheriff and Gisborne.

409
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,228
They've got them trapped
up a tree surrounded.

410
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:05,295
We need to go. Now!

411
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:09,941
Immediately!

412
00:29:12,296 --> 00:29:13,737
OK, line up!

413
00:29:14,291 --> 00:29:16,757
You, over there!

414
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:44,975
Let's get him down! Come on! Line up!

415
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:47,105
Saddle me up another horse,
make it a fast one.

416
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,689
I'll be leaving shortly.

417
00:29:55,809 --> 00:29:57,387
It's just a matter of time now
Hood, start saying your prayers.

418
00:29:57,507 --> 00:30:00,319
If they come any nearer,

419
00:30:02,638 --> 00:30:05,152
they'll get the same.
And I won't be aiming at their feet!

420
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,009
- Give me your arrows.
- It's not enough.

421
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,472
Well, they don't know that, do they?

422
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:11,920
- Ready?
- Yeah.

423
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,887
Move!

424
00:30:21,007 --> 00:30:23,560
I'll scream, then I can say
you were holding me hostage.

425
00:30:24,091 --> 00:30:25,719
You didn't scream earlier.
He's not stupid.

426
00:30:28,652 --> 00:30:30,479
I'll deal with this, Marian.

427
00:30:31,118 --> 00:30:33,706
It'll take them hours
to cut down this tree.

428
00:30:33,826 --> 00:30:35,589
And in that time, the gang
will realise something's wrong.

429
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:37,777
Yeah? They'll come and help.

430
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,373
Come, come.

431
00:30:41,722 --> 00:30:43,404
That's it, stop.

432
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:46,241
I can't hear an axe.

433
00:30:52,937 --> 00:30:54,719
What are they waiting for?

434
00:30:55,218 --> 00:30:56,393
You know what that is, don't you?

435
00:30:56,835 --> 00:30:58,729
It's pitch.

436
00:31:03,466 --> 00:31:04,511
It burns hot and it burns fast.

437
00:31:12,323 --> 00:31:14,319
Go, go, go!

438
00:31:14,782 --> 00:31:15,886
- Much, I think it's this way.
- You think?!

439
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:18,737
Shhh!

440
00:31:18,857 --> 00:31:20,600
Don't tell me to shush!
We're looking for a tree in a forest!

441
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:23,463
Shut up and listen!

442
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,040
I hope you're ready, Hood!

443
00:31:29,521 --> 00:31:32,778
I'm sensing it's that way.

444
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:37,309
You tried to cover me in pitch
once, Hood, do you remember?

445
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:39,969
Tried to cook me alive
in my own armour.

446
00:31:40,649 --> 00:31:44,186
Yeah!
I should have gone through with it!

447
00:31:46,793 --> 00:31:49,658
Talking trees are good.
But burning bushes are better.

448
00:31:49,778 --> 00:31:51,458
I don't see a trough of
water for you to jump into.

449
00:31:51,578 --> 00:31:53,862
If I were bound and gagged

450
00:31:53,982 --> 00:31:55,719
I couldn't scream,
so all we have to do...

451
00:32:02,764 --> 00:32:05,120
- No!
- There's no other way!

452
00:32:06,313 --> 00:32:08,557
<i>- There's always another way.
- Shields!</i>

453
00:32:08,761 --> 00:32:11,744
This is just putting off the inevitable.

454
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:14,984
- You're not going back to him.
- I can do more good in the castle.

455
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:18,261
Marian, I would rather die
here than have you go back...

456
00:32:19,891 --> 00:32:21,155
If you die now,
my father died for nothing.

457
00:32:22,037 --> 00:32:24,557
Trust me,

458
00:32:24,677 --> 00:32:26,237
- I'll get us out of this.
- No, you won't!

459
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:28,538
Not without my help.

460
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:30,654
Look, we're in this together.

461
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:35,707
Now, tie me up.

462
00:32:35,977 --> 00:32:37,707
Right, listen to me. He's only
got two choices now. Run or burn.

463
00:32:37,896 --> 00:32:41,390
Either way he's finished.

464
00:32:42,495 --> 00:32:44,323
And any bird that leaves
those leaves dies in the sky.

465
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:48,280
There are too many of them.

466
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,665
- What are we going to do?
- After "three" open the shield wall.

467
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,960
One.

468
00:32:58,858 --> 00:32:59,865
Two.

469
00:33:14,974 --> 00:33:16,065
Three!

470
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:17,740
Gisborne!

471
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:19,365
If I die,

472
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:22,563
Marian dies!

473
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:28,319
No!

474
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:31,200
No! Move! Marian!

475
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:33,849
So it's true.

476
00:33:33,969 --> 00:33:37,327
You still love her.

477
00:33:38,413 --> 00:33:41,970
I've found your weakness, Gisborne.

478
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,280
If you harm a single hair on her head,
I swear I will kill you!

479
00:33:44,646 --> 00:33:47,920
You'll die more slowly and painfully
than any man has ever died before!

480
00:33:48,398 --> 00:33:50,811
- Well, I thought that was the point!
- No.

481
00:33:53,828 --> 00:33:55,265
- It would have been quick and painless.
- You let me go,

482
00:33:59,252 --> 00:34:02,012
I'll leave her behind. Untouched.

483
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:06,326
I'll think about it.

484
00:34:08,345 --> 00:34:09,481
Everybody back! Move!

485
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:12,307
Well... that bought us some time.

486
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:13,639
Any ideas?

487
00:34:14,847 --> 00:34:16,279
We need to make
Robin and Marian disappear.

488
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,029
how do we do that?

489
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:21,306
A puff of smoke.

490
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:24,125
Be careful.

491
00:34:24,468 --> 00:34:26,557
Are you all right?

492
00:34:26,677 --> 00:34:30,079
I won't leave you behind.

493
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:31,845
But we can make him think that I will.

494
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:34,428
So now we can all see the famous
Robin Hood for who he really is.

495
00:34:34,737 --> 00:34:38,218
A common coward

496
00:34:39,001 --> 00:34:42,268
using an innocent woman as a hostage.

497
00:34:44,877 --> 00:34:46,137
She's not an innocent,
she's one of you lot!

498
00:34:46,361 --> 00:34:49,919
A pampered parasite
living off the backs of the poor.

499
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,599
Nothing personal.

500
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,340
You can't hide behind her skirts
for ever. Come and fight like a man.

501
00:34:57,334 --> 00:34:59,146
Remove your soldiers, Gisborne!

502
00:34:59,546 --> 00:35:02,820
Or she dies at sundown!

503
00:35:04,193 --> 00:35:06,060
He wouldn't do that, would he?

504
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,972
He's bluffing. This is a siege.
All I have to do is wait.

505
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:16,864
Well, you can't wait too long, though.

506
00:35:18,228 --> 00:35:19,290
As soon as the Sheriff
gets back, she's gonna die.

507
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,760
Ready?

508
00:35:51,035 --> 00:35:54,280
Let's go.

509
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:56,800
The forest's on fire.

510
00:35:57,108 --> 00:35:58,679
It's a smoke screen.
You, you and you! Find the fire!

511
00:35:58,888 --> 00:35:59,900
Put it out!
His men are in the forest.

512
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:04,119
Surround the tree.

513
00:36:05,441 --> 00:36:07,658
Move!

514
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,603
Make sure you see the man on
either side of you at all times.

515
00:36:16,723 --> 00:36:18,759
Right, close in the circle, move in!

516
00:36:19,683 --> 00:36:22,159
Yes!

517
00:36:26,074 --> 00:36:27,380
I know what you're doing, Hood,
and it won't work.

518
00:36:28,361 --> 00:36:29,559
<i>We're ready for you. Ready and waiting.</i>

519
00:36:30,662 --> 00:36:31,854
It's from Will.

520
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:41,640
He's got a plan.

521
00:36:45,813 --> 00:36:47,956
Here. Here.

522
00:36:48,076 --> 00:36:51,720
Good. Horses.

523
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,753
You'll have to put your arms around me.

524
00:36:56,008 --> 00:36:58,559
- No, I'm not coming.
- Marian, we haven't got time for this!

525
00:37:01,288 --> 00:37:03,750
- Then go, before they see the rope.
- We can both go now.

526
00:37:04,637 --> 00:37:07,249
I'm staying here
until you get away safely.

527
00:37:07,566 --> 00:37:11,549
- This is about Gisborne, isn't it?
- No.

528
00:37:12,008 --> 00:37:15,170
Inside us, we both know
we belong together.

529
00:37:17,772 --> 00:37:18,880
And being apart will tear me apart
but I'm more use in the castle.

530
00:37:23,073 --> 00:37:24,461
I can protect you better from there.
It's our only hope.

531
00:37:24,726 --> 00:37:27,904
Trust me.

532
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:38,285
Give me your hand.

533
00:37:46,081 --> 00:37:48,481
- No. Just give me your hand.
- Is this a trick?

534
00:37:48,805 --> 00:37:51,560
It's an engagement ring.

535
00:37:51,721 --> 00:37:55,424
- This afternoon we had a plan.
- Yes,

536
00:37:56,555 --> 00:38:00,163
find Lardner
and bring the King home.

537
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:02,587
Defeat the Sheriff and get
married, in that order, Robin.

538
00:38:06,169 --> 00:38:08,586
First things first.
This isn't what I want to do.

539
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,580
It's what I have to do.

540
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,199
- I love you.
- I love you too.

541
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:42,389
- Let's just get out of here.
- Has Will got everything?

542
00:38:42,756 --> 00:38:44,437
Help!

543
00:38:44,557 --> 00:38:46,199
Somebody please help me!

544
00:38:46,361 --> 00:38:48,572
- Robin's gone.
- Get after him.

545
00:38:48,908 --> 00:38:51,580
Do not let him release that bird.

546
00:38:51,761 --> 00:38:54,040
£50 to the man who kills the pigeon.

547
00:38:54,306 --> 00:38:55,693
He's left me up here
to die, help me!

548
00:38:56,932 --> 00:38:59,120
Marian, I'm coming!

549
00:38:59,445 --> 00:39:00,523
- Is the note ready?
- Yeah. Where's Marian?

550
00:39:00,782 --> 00:39:03,166
She's fine.

551
00:39:03,286 --> 00:39:05,441
Just get out of here
and don't let that bird go

552
00:39:14,353 --> 00:39:16,149
until you're out of range, all right?

553
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:22,780
I'm coming! Marian...

554
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:25,167
Nearly there. Marian, hold on!

555
00:39:31,639 --> 00:39:34,260
Hurry up!

556
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,779
It's all right, I've got you.
I've got you.

557
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:43,641
You're coming home with me.

558
00:39:50,532 --> 00:39:51,780
You're safe now.

559
00:39:52,011 --> 00:39:53,105
Release the bird!

560
00:40:21,573 --> 00:40:22,574
Release it!

561
00:40:36,349 --> 00:40:37,476
Come on!

562
00:41:16,104 --> 00:41:18,240
And fetch...

563
00:41:18,401 --> 00:41:19,799
- Cheer up.
- What have I got to be cheery about?

564
00:41:21,384 --> 00:41:23,520
Well, we've got a visitor.

565
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,363
- Who are you?
- Not him.

566
00:41:26,121 --> 00:41:28,047
Him!

567
00:41:29,717 --> 00:41:30,719
It's Lardner. Say hello.

568
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:34,457
You're joking?

569
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:37,160
When you want something
to disappear, the trick

570
00:41:37,321 --> 00:41:40,218
- is to divert the audience attention.
- He switched the birds.

571
00:41:41,102 --> 00:41:43,486
I just happened to have
a spare stuck up my sleeve.

572
00:41:43,606 --> 00:41:45,240
Should've attached a verse
of the note to the decoy bird.

573
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:49,371
Nah. Would've just weighed him down.

574
00:41:49,491 --> 00:41:51,280
Yes, speaking of decoy birds,

575
00:41:52,229 --> 00:41:53,666
is Marian all right with Gisborne?

576
00:41:54,464 --> 00:41:56,162
Yeah, she'll be fine.

577
00:41:58,817 --> 00:42:01,576
She can look after herself.

578
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,352
Well, hey.
Do you want to do the honours?

579
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:07,223
At least we have some hope now.

580
00:42:09,642 --> 00:42:11,128
Yeah. Thanks to Lardner.

581
00:42:11,775 --> 00:42:13,260
Good luck, my friend.

582
00:42:32,961 --> 00:42:34,783
Safe journey home.

583
00:42:34,903 --> 00:42:37,160
The Sheriff's missing. Find him.

584
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,400
Nottingham is about to be flattened.

585
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,160
I don't think Robin is the
problem. He might be the solution.

586
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,839
<i>- Ask.
- Nooooo!</i>

587
00:42:47,059 --> 00:42:49,559
Marry me now.
And make it the last thing we do.

588
00:42:49,721 --> 00:42:52,014
- Who are you?
- I am the man with the plan.

589
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,911
- The Sheriff is heading for the camp.
- It's time...

590
00:42:55,561 --> 00:42:57,479
They're coming, they're coming!!

591
00:42:55,561 --> 00:42:57,479
Get those gates open!
