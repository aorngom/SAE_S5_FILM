1
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:07,606
How?

2
00:00:07,898 --> 00:00:11,464
- Joderic will be under orders.
- No, it's not for you to worry about.

3
00:00:11,703 --> 00:00:13,336
I cannot be seeing to take from you.

4
00:00:14,113 --> 00:00:16,231
I cannot even be seeing with you,
or Matthew...

5
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:18,897
- Or matthew has to work at the castle.
- Owen.

6
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,995
Take your wife and family

7
00:00:21,135 --> 00:00:23,462
and get your belongings back into the mount.

8
00:00:23,987 --> 00:00:26,545
Joderic will not evict you today.

9
00:00:35,973 --> 00:00:36,900
Let's go.

10
00:00:39,115 --> 00:00:40,397
What are you waiting for?

11
00:00:41,437 --> 00:00:42,377
Nothing.

12
00:00:43,884 --> 00:00:45,778
<i>Everything is gonna be allright.</i>

13
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:48,767
- Oh, please.
- What?

14
00:00:48,996 --> 00:00:50,973
You wanna see
the look on their face, don't you?

15
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:52,652
You wanna see their gratitude.

16
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:02,786
Joderic.

17
00:01:08,264 --> 00:01:09,273
Robin.

18
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:12,383
Do not interfere.
You know I have to do this.

19
00:01:12,604 --> 00:01:14,512
And you know there are
sheriff's men on their way

20
00:01:14,513 --> 00:01:16,158
to make you there's no trouble.

21
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:17,778
Do you have to do this?

22
00:01:17,861 --> 00:01:20,004
I did it on the old sheriff,
you did not complain.

23
00:01:20,005 --> 00:01:21,179
That was different.

24
00:01:21,421 --> 00:01:22,182
How?

25
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:26,073
Two things are certain in life:
death and taxes.

26
00:01:26,173 --> 00:01:28,343
But when the death is caused
by the taxes

27
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:29,892
something is rotten.

28
00:01:30,556 --> 00:01:31,468
Take this.

29
00:01:31,938 --> 00:01:32,947
The miller's debt.

30
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:35,166
I cannot.

31
00:01:35,456 --> 00:01:37,156
This is stolen money.

32
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,530
The Sheriff knows the miller cannot afford it.

33
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,032
I could break it into small amounts.

34
00:01:46,142 --> 00:01:48,520
Payed in over time, that would be credible.

35
00:01:48,645 --> 00:01:51,092
Every time somebody breaks bread
in Nettlestone,

36
00:01:51,093 --> 00:01:52,920
they will thank you, Joderic.

37
00:01:53,402 --> 00:01:55,338
- Sure.
- Then, do me a favor:

38
00:01:56,043 --> 00:01:57,799
tell them that you have not seen me,

39
00:01:58,006 --> 00:01:59,792
tell them this is your own scheme.

40
00:01:59,903 --> 00:02:02,654
- Why?
- My friends think I'm vain.

41
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:16,480
Is he here to evict us?

42
00:02:16,538 --> 00:02:19,164
- Robin did not make it right.
- He said he would fix it.

43
00:02:19,165 --> 00:02:20,049
How?

44
00:02:22,165 --> 00:02:23,907
Let me get this straight.

45
00:02:24,241 --> 00:02:26,605
We're giving money to a taxe collector.

46
00:02:26,881 --> 00:02:28,084
A bailiff.

47
00:02:28,665 --> 00:02:30,683
Oh, that makes all differents.

48
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:44,866
Owen.

49
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:46,926
Kate.

50
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,963
- As you know, I'm here today...
- Didn't you see Robin Hood?

51
00:02:51,123 --> 00:02:53,404
He said he'd speak to you
so we wouldn't be evicted.

52
00:02:53,473 --> 00:02:54,234
No.

53
00:02:55,118 --> 00:02:56,611
No, I'm sorry.

54
00:02:56,929 --> 00:02:58,685
I have not seen Robin Hood.

55
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:02,430
But, we can work this out.

56
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:10,933
He's killed him.

57
00:03:11,186 --> 00:03:12,637
Robin's killed him.

58
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,644
Wait! Stop!

59
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,223
Master!

60
00:04:23,343 --> 00:04:25,431
What, you can't believe
someone is better than you?

61
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,338
He kicked you good.

62
00:04:27,746 --> 00:04:28,659
Who is he?

63
00:04:29,004 --> 00:04:30,179
The Night Watchman.

64
00:04:30,614 --> 00:04:32,909
- I've never heard of him.
- The Night Watchman?

65
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:35,000
Been around for years.

66
00:04:35,553 --> 00:04:37,336
Maybe, you were off for the Crusade.

67
00:04:38,062 --> 00:04:39,043
He's a good man.

68
00:04:39,956 --> 00:04:42,191
He's talked about in all the villages.

69
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:44,182
He's been seiing in Nothingam even at the castle.

70
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:45,861
Always at night.

71
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:47,597
Leaves medecine and stuff,

72
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:48,896
food.

73
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:52,860
Sheriff men are ordered to shoot him
on sights but he's never ***he fly???.

74
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:55,148
Why did he kill Joderic then?

75
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:58,591
We need to find him.

76
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:05,007
The villagers of Nettlestone report,

77
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:09,179
that Robin Hood killed an innocent bailiff today.

78
00:05:10,056 --> 00:05:12,102
This is marvellous, isn't it.

79
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,277
What a drama.

80
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,709
Because now,
even his beloved villagers,

81
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:20,815
will loose patience when
the heroes start picking them off.

82
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:23,582
What else did they say ?

83
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:26,776
Hood was fulfilling(orthographe?) a promise to prevent an eviction.

84
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,794
War has altered his brain, I'm not at all surprised.

85
00:05:32,062 --> 00:05:32,850
SO,

86
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:35,463
what do you propose we're doing?

87
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:39,790
- Immediate reprisals againt villagers.
- Joderic would not want that.

88
00:05:40,371 --> 00:05:43,996
Why should more innocent people
suffer because of his death?

89
00:05:44,286 --> 00:05:47,977
The same people who witnessed and reported the crime.

90
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:52,363
Did the strategy of reprisals
worked in the villages before ?

91
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:54,796
No.

92
00:05:56,372 --> 00:05:57,478
Marian is right.

93
00:06:00,013 --> 00:06:04,466
We're not be going down that road again,*** alternatives.

94
00:06:04,783 --> 00:06:08,723
There's a political advantage to be at him.

95
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:11,137
Robin Hood is giving us the high ground.

96
00:06:11,138 --> 00:06:13,260
We should keep it my thoughts, exactly.

97
00:06:13,413 --> 00:06:16,396
we could have the town cryer's 
announcements taking place.


98
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:20,259
make sure everybody knows,
that an innocent was killed.

99
00:06:20,523 --> 00:06:21,411
Good.

100
00:06:23,409 --> 00:06:25,781
We are going to win hearts and minds.

101
00:06:27,821 --> 00:06:28,917
My Lord...

102
00:06:29,408 --> 00:06:31,899
I still believe action is rather than words.

103
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:36,428
If I had resources. I can do with him, I could
hunt him down.

104
00:06:37,164 --> 00:06:40,660
Very well. We'll do both of it.
The best man win

105
00:06:46,945 --> 00:06:49,068
<i>Joderic was unique.</i>

106
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:51,426
He was kind,

107
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,951
compassionate, learned.

108
00:06:55,569 --> 00:06:57,431
 <i>The murder of the bailiff...</i>

109
00:06:57,432 --> 00:06:59,765
We'll leave as soons as
Joderic is burried.

110
00:07:00,577 --> 00:07:02,880
- We could say you were too upset.
- Murder.

111
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:04,968
I am too upset.

112
00:07:07,285 --> 00:07:09,990
<i>In response to this change of direction</i>

113
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:11,919
- <i>from Robin Hood...</i>
- Joe ?

114
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:14,923
What're you doing here ?

115
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:16,892
You cannot work.

116
00:07:16,934 --> 00:07:18,377
<i> I've recalled...</i>

117
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,082
They made ??? ever and come back in.

118
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:23,170
Called me out of the retirement.

119
00:07:23,447 --> 00:07:25,029
I will talk to the sheriff.

120
00:07:25,598 --> 00:07:27,221
I will get you off you duties.

121
00:07:27,262 --> 00:07:28,580
<i> Make no mistake...</i>

122
00:07:28,677 --> 00:07:30,349
Work helps.

123
00:07:31,362 --> 00:07:35,674
- <i>These people that Robin hood...</i>
-  I still reach out for her in the night, I know it's daft.

124
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,473
It is not daft.

125
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,212
When all this is over,
you are coming home with us.

126
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,868
All this, though(t) *...

127
00:07:48,085 --> 00:07:48,972
One man,

128
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:50,770
one arrow,

129
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:53,488
fired from the bow,

130
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:56,984
- <i>Robin Hood...</i>
- He's saying that you killed Joderic.

131
00:07:56,985 --> 00:07:59,793
- Of couse, he is.
- he s pretty making look us like,

132
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,049
criminals.

133
00:08:01,153 --> 00:08:03,248
You know we are criminals.

134
00:08:03,581 --> 00:08:05,218
???Or so,??? listen someone else.
ou ???Or at least, somebody else.ou...

135
00:08:05,745 --> 00:08:07,673
Between stability,

136
00:08:08,464 --> 00:08:10,961
order, authority...

137
00:08:11,556 --> 00:08:15,079
Or the random chaotic cruelty
of Robin Hood

138
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,049
And all outlaws like him.

139
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:20,736
<i>This cowarded crime,
this murder, will be punished.</i>

140
00:08:21,225 --> 00:08:23,265
We'll hunt Hood down.

141
00:08:23,331 --> 00:08:27,129
With dogs, if necessary
and we will insure that he does not succeed...

142
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,944
See, we would not be coward,
this is what he wants.

143
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:33,537
You never shoot me, understand?

144
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:41,518
This... this is all in my honor, isn't it?

145
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:43,724
Do you really do think
everything's about you, don't you?

146
00:08:43,738 --> 00:08:47,090
- Only when it is about me.
- You have given him a stick to beat you with.

147
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:50,552
You killed an innocent clerk??? , now,
here he is, making the most??? of it.

148
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:52,506
I did not do it.
- I'm sure.

149
00:08:53,895 --> 00:08:56,795
He was the so-called non-violent, Night Watchman.

150
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:58,761
I saw him.

151
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:01,381
- I was there.
- It was not the Night Watchman.

152
00:09:01,382 --> 00:09:02,657
- How do you know?
- I know.

153
00:09:02,727 --> 00:09:05,248
- Then why did he run?
- Why did you run from Joderic?

154
00:09:09,283 --> 00:09:10,198
I should go.

155
00:09:11,419 --> 00:09:13,236
- You must help me.
- I am helping you

156
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:16,094
- I'm telling you it was not the Night Watchman.
- and wether it is,

157
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:19,166
I will find him, I can look
everywhere a part from one place.

158
00:09:21,063 --> 00:09:22,718
I need you to look in the castle.

159
00:09:22,732 --> 00:09:25,361
- I need you to not tell me what to do.
- Please.

160
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:28,209
- I must clear my name.
- Without catching the killer?

161
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:30,310
Is that not more important
that your name ?

162
00:09:30,311 --> 00:09:32,820
If people do not trust me,
then what good can I do?

163
00:09:35,972 --> 00:09:36,836
I'll try.

164
00:09:41,901 --> 00:09:45,796
Tell me, ??? is the Master of Arms??? is it just a ceremony or a polition, now???

165
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:48,825
Because problems like Hood...

166
00:09:48,826 --> 00:09:50,567
demand real solutions.

167
00:09:51,689 --> 00:09:52,961
Town cryers.

168
00:09:59,372 --> 00:10:00,289
Sir Guy.

169
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:01,999
Marian.

170
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:04,414
All these dogs for one man.

171
00:10:05,324 --> 00:10:06,897
Yeah, it's my idea.

172
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,666
The Master of Arms ??? will do nothing.

173
00:10:10,247 --> 00:10:11,772
You are in competitions?

174
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,609
He's little man promoted too far,


175
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,404
when anyone will make a better Master of Arms.

176
00:10:16,771 --> 00:10:17,743
Politics.

177
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,954
Even when my father was the sheriff

178
00:10:19,955 --> 00:10:22,012
I could not grasp the intricacies

179
00:10:22,776 --> 00:10:24,134
He sent me here by the way.

180
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:26,857
He thinks it is safer with the killer on the roads.

181
00:10:26,925 --> 00:10:29,470
You say "a killer", you do not think it is Hood?

182
00:10:30,852 --> 00:10:31,974
Whoever it is.

183
00:10:32,077 --> 00:10:34,526
He thought it would be safer
here in the castle.

184
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:36,934
No, that's not permitted.

185
00:10:43,413 --> 00:10:45,006
I'll talk to the sheriff.

186
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:47,942
Thank you, Sir guy.

187
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:53,319
Raw into a line, sweeping ???self through the forest.

188
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,796
Let's show the??? I had to hunt down Robin Hood.

189
00:10:55,978 --> 00:10:58,174
With these dogs, he will run.

190
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:08,141
This, I do not like.

191
00:11:13,496 --> 00:11:15,630
The kings guild of??? forresters***.

192
00:11:16,055 --> 00:11:17,395
Coming this way.

193
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,709
Dogs.

194
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:28,846
Pairs ???

195
00:11:29,284 --> 00:11:30,734
Meet where we store the provisions.

196
00:11:45,493 --> 00:11:46,877
Up there, now !

197
00:12:12,752 --> 00:12:14,521
Matthew, am I left handed ?

198
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:17,048
clue :

199
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:20,004
No !

200
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,225
Sorry Sir!

201
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:33,519
Stand on my leg ???.

202
00:12:36,385 --> 00:12:37,665
right one.

203
00:12:39,227 --> 00:12:40,185
Well, now...

204
00:12:41,033 --> 00:12:43,277
That might help you to remember.

205
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:47,092
So...

206
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,129
New boy, how do you find  your new job?

207
00:12:53,824 --> 00:12:54,850
Don't worry.

208
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:55,863
You know...

209
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:57,277
You're a lucky boy.

210
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,191
Now that your daddy's mill is shot, you could be....

211
00:13:00,192 --> 00:13:02,801
you could be running through the forest,
chased by owles...

212
00:13:05,477 --> 00:13:07,064
Guards, guards!

213
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,047
Raise the alarm!

214
00:13:13,992 --> 00:13:15,784
In my own room, in my own room!

215
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,728
Where're the men?

216
00:13:17,002 --> 00:13:18,261
Gisbourne has taken them.

217
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:20,067
to hunt Hood with the dogs.

218
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,533
Gisbourne is fool.

219
00:13:21,754 --> 00:13:23,861
Evidently, Hood has evaded them.

220
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:25,338
This stuff has nothing to do with Robin Hood!

221
00:13:25,366 --> 00:13:26,638
Now, you lock down this castle

222
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,074
You tell Gisbourne to scrap the dogs.
and find the killer !


223
00:13:29,183 --> 00:13:30,073
Yes, my Lord.

224
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:39,506
Stop !
Talk Gisbourne to double the dogs!

225
00:13:39,771 --> 00:13:41,890
But my Lord, I thought you said
it could not be Hood.

226
00:13:42,045 --> 00:13:43,492
Two words : Mud sticks.

227
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:45,981
Hood's over to be blamed for one death. Let's blame him for two.
Let's Gisbourne have his ???part???

228
00:13:46,102 --> 00:13:47,867
Meanwhile,

229
00:13:48,026 --> 00:13:50,515
You find out who's really
responsible of this.
Yes Mylord.


230
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,790
NETTLESTONE VILLAGE

231
00:14:26,437 --> 00:14:28,001
We pray for Matthew's soul,

232
00:14:28,822 --> 00:14:30,587
as he journeys to a better place.

233
00:14:32,465 --> 00:14:33,860
Whatever??? is Matthew,

234
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:35,776
And be proud.

235
00:14:37,213 --> 00:14:39,457
We will bring Robin Hood to justice.

236
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:42,371
You have my word.

237
00:14:55,124 --> 00:14:56,273
I don't believe it.

238
00:14:56,656 --> 00:14:57,901
The soldiers found it.

239
00:15:00,008 --> 00:15:01,021
That was our...

240
00:15:02,014 --> 00:15:04,477
- That was our store.
- They don't have destroyed everything.

241
00:15:04,518 --> 00:15:05,818
That was our food.

242
00:15:18,911 --> 00:15:20,142
What is going on?

243
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:22,432
I'm hiding in my own castle,

244
00:15:22,473 --> 00:15:24,895
I cannot move in my own ****out.

245
00:15:25,278 --> 00:15:27,399
- Out! Get out!
- We will not *** stone until, My Lord,

246
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,205
the killer will be found.

247
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:32,520
Not ***stone ??? he will be found.
Lody dody da...

248
00:15:32,657 --> 00:15:34,053
Well, get on with it then.

249
00:15:46,364 --> 00:15:48,567
How is Gisbourne doing with Locksley?

250
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:52,758
More dogs have been brought in,
but the outlaw is still on the run.

251
00:15:54,509 --> 00:15:56,863
Have you put it  **** twice?

252
00:15:56,968 --> 00:15:58,774
- Yes, My Lord.
- Good.

253
00:15:59,882 --> 00:16:00,895
Do you think...

254
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:03,385
Two deaths are enough?

255
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,791
To get them to really...
turn against them the rebel?

256
00:16:09,159 --> 00:16:12,073
If we're going to blame Hood,
let's do it properly.

257
00:16:12,368 --> 00:16:13,380
What do you think?

258
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:16,336
I think maybe...

259
00:16:17,252 --> 00:16:19,551
A few more deaths'd be interesting,
you know, pretty deaths,

260
00:16:19,606 --> 00:16:20,605
not just poison???, but...

261
00:16:20,947 --> 00:16:21,987
Pretty deaths.

262
00:16:37,805 --> 00:16:38,804
Guards!

263
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,487
Quickly! The ****place

263
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,805
Lady Marian.

264
00:16:50,571 --> 00:16:51,584
Come over, please.

265
00:16:51,585 --> 00:16:53,972
How could this happen
after you had the castle locked down?*

266
00:16:54,027 --> 00:16:56,750
You must go back to your room,
it is not safe here.

267
00:17:10,106 --> 00:17:11,543
What is going on here?

268
00:17:11,981 --> 00:17:14,074
Three people have been killed
under your nose.

269
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:16,277
- Well, that is unfortunate.
- It's incompetent.

270
00:17:16,414 --> 00:17:17,522
And what have you achieved?

271
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:19,606
You found some food,
the remanence of a picnic,

272
00:17:19,653 --> 00:17:21,760
- but Robin Hood, no.
- At least, I found something,

273
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:23,279
This is more than could be said for you.

274
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,387
Shut up!

275
00:17:24,483 --> 00:17:25,537
Common up, women.

276
00:17:26,864 --> 00:17:27,877
Grow up.

277
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:34,071
Forgive me.

278
00:17:34,413 --> 00:17:35,754
All these killings,

279
00:17:36,083 --> 00:17:38,819
they are attributed to Robin Hood,
but what proof is there?

280
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:40,872
There were no witnesses.

281
00:17:40,973 --> 00:17:44,763
How could he have moved about the castle
unchallenged by your guards?

282
00:17:45,091 --> 00:17:46,240
And you yourself,

283
00:17:46,241 --> 00:17:48,676
you must have been there
moments before the maid was killed.

284
00:17:49,388 --> 00:17:51,112
That I cannot record*recall?.

285
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:54,168
And from one point of view,
the killings have been useful, no?

286
00:17:54,414 --> 00:17:55,988
Giving you the chance to shine?

287
00:18:04,814 --> 00:18:05,964
She's here???.

288
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:08,263
She's guessing, My Lord,
she's a girl.

289
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:37,488
*** bring some water.

290
00:18:39,992 --> 00:18:41,867
A bit of bread wouldn't go amiss.

291
00:18:42,404 --> 00:18:44,033
Have some cheese.

292
00:18:45,332 --> 00:18:47,248
We're gonna make captured

293
00:18:47,535 --> 00:18:49,588
tortured and hanged.

294
00:18:51,316 --> 00:18:53,710
And you want--
You want some cheese.

295
00:18:57,542 --> 00:18:58,828
Will they ever give up?

296
00:19:07,032 --> 00:19:08,455
Master, the dogs!

297
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,149
You cannot stay!
There's too many of them.

298
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,752
Well, we must do something.

299
00:19:14,655 --> 00:19:17,378
We are running away
when we should be at pursuit.

300
00:19:17,775 --> 00:19:19,732
The Night Watchman is still out there.

301
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,390
We head East.

302
00:19:34,794 --> 00:19:36,505
Back to Nettlestone.

303
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:44,539
NETTLESTONE VILLAGE

304
00:19:46,578 --> 00:19:48,781
Get out of our village,
you're not welcome here.

305
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:53,420
Hello. Excuse me.

306
00:19:53,912 --> 00:19:55,773
Do you know if the Night Watchman
has been back here?

307
00:19:57,035 --> 00:19:58,568
Has the Night Watchman ****?

308
00:19:58,910 --> 00:20:00,593
- Do you have any food?
- Not for anyone of you.*

309
00:20:00,634 --> 00:20:01,742
Any water, anything?

310
00:20:01,838 --> 00:20:02,877
We are wary.

320
00:20:03,932 --> 00:20:06,039
- You killed my son!
- What?

321
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,518
Kate, you know me!

322
00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:14,713
and Joderic

323
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:16,697
You told me yourself you'd see to him.

324
00:20:16,834 --> 00:20:18,271
For known, you've kill him.

325
00:20:18,371 --> 00:20:20,900
Owen.
I swear I could never hurt Matthew.

326
00:20:21,212 --> 00:20:23,119
Matthew!
Don't you say his name!

327
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,980
Don't you put his name in your mouth!

328
00:20:24,981 --> 00:20:26,813
I swear!
I never killed Matthew!

328
00:20:27,238 --> 00:20:28,428
I didn't kill Joderic.

329
00:20:28,429 --> 00:20:30,207
No, you didn't kill all those others either.

330
00:20:31,082 --> 00:20:32,095
What others?

331
00:20:32,587 --> 00:20:34,064
****

332
00:20:36,473 --> 00:20:38,812
Wait, I didn't do it!
I didn't do any of it!

333
00:20:38,813 --> 00:20:40,386
Hold them for the sheriff.

334
00:20:44,517 --> 00:20:46,036
I'm fighting for you.

335
00:20:47,623 --> 00:20:50,305
The sheriff hangs people
for stealing bread.

336
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,795
He cuts out their tongues.

337
00:20:54,154 --> 00:20:55,385
He divides us.

338
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,642
We are going!

339
00:20:59,121 --> 00:21:00,366
Let's get out of here!

340
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:06,305
Stay back.

341
00:21:09,945 --> 00:21:10,903
Stay there.

342
00:21:23,403 --> 00:21:24,976
I walked away for my home,

343
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:27,522
For them.

344
00:21:27,949 --> 00:21:30,248
I gave myself off to the sheriff,
for them.

345
00:21:30,494 --> 00:21:32,451
We gave Joderic money for them.

346
00:21:32,738 --> 00:21:34,517
I never really did understand that.

347
00:21:39,352 --> 00:21:40,638
It's the-- It's a tag.

348
00:21:42,403 --> 00:21:44,469
I will* find it you can't* copy it now.

349
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,726
There's only me and my Dad now,
had to do it just like that.

350
00:21:48,437 --> 00:21:49,450
It's good.

351
00:21:51,134 --> 00:21:52,146
It's good.

352
00:22:00,156 --> 00:22:01,935
Sorry, My Lady,
you can't come through here.

353
00:22:02,168 --> 00:22:03,673
I've come to see Sergeant Lacey.

354
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:04,918
I'll deal with this.

355
00:22:09,091 --> 00:22:10,473
You shouldn't be here, Marian.

356
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,583
- It's not safe.
- I know, thank you.

357
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:14,745
It's all right.

358
00:22:15,511 --> 00:22:16,852
It's not, though, is it?

359
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:23,799
No, You'd thought

360
00:22:23,895 --> 00:22:24,962
Robin a killer.

361
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,258
All these people dead, I...

362
00:22:30,134 --> 00:22:31,379
can't understand.

363
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,256
Matthew,

364
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:37,430
his poor mum and dad :

365
00:22:38,237 --> 00:22:39,291
I know how they feel.

366
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,397
It was the same with Ruth.

367
00:22:45,221 --> 00:22:46,754
You try not to dwell on it.

368
00:22:48,669 --> 00:22:49,956
Remember the good times.

369
00:22:53,299 --> 00:22:54,872
The only thing I regret is that...

370
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,308
she didn't die in our own bed.

371
00:22:58,225 --> 00:22:59,552
that I can not(that kind of)...???

372
00:23:24,535 --> 00:23:25,547
John?

373
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,284
I need you to take over.

374
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:30,678
I have to go to the castle.

375
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,257
Enough is enough.

376
00:23:32,393 --> 00:23:33,789
We stop running, now.

377
00:23:34,035 --> 00:23:35,417
You're not gonna give yourself in again?

378
00:23:35,418 --> 00:23:36,416
Not this time.

379
00:23:36,417 --> 00:23:37,908
Go somewhere *** where I can get in.

380
00:23:38,277 --> 00:23:39,290
Go on.

381
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:41,205
Well, do you want clever
or really clever?

382
00:23:41,369 --> 00:23:42,381
I want fast.

383
00:23:43,818 --> 00:23:44,858
From here,

384
00:23:45,446 --> 00:23:48,018
could I shoot an arrow
through that window?

385
00:23:49,838 --> 00:23:51,754
Pull smoothly
like you're combing your hair.

386
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:02,749
You could.

387
00:24:04,379 --> 00:24:05,857
But of course, I wouldn't.

388
00:24:09,921 --> 00:24:11,357
You're teasing me, aren't you?

389
00:24:18,304 --> 00:24:20,548
Yeah, I'd say anything that will...

390
00:24:21,964 --> 00:24:23,340
And from the days when you could.

391
00:24:24,556 --> 00:24:26,239
Nowadays, we hold our tongues.

392
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:28,537
Those of us lucky enough
to still have them.

393
00:24:29,837 --> 00:24:31,466
Say one thing when we mean another.

394
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,533
For instance,

395
00:24:37,298 --> 00:24:39,159
will you say you want archery lessons,
but...

396
00:24:39,501 --> 00:24:41,991
You have really only interested
in bow range.

397
00:24:48,131 --> 00:24:49,855
You're trying to prove
it couldn't be him?

398
00:24:51,346 --> 00:24:52,386
You still love him.

399
00:24:52,273 --> 00:24:53,572
No.

400
00:24:57,173 --> 00:24:57,963
-Who?

401
00:25:01,195 --> 00:25:01,793
-Tell him,

402
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:05,044
not that you've ever seen him, but tell him,

403
00:25:06,868 --> 00:25:09,048
good people do still love him.

404
00:25:13,457 --> 00:25:17,151
Château de Nottingham

405
00:26:24,752 --> 00:26:27,993
Why can it never be a beautiful woman or so...

406
00:26:28,722 --> 00:26:30,165
Call off your dogs.

407
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:32,017
Why? you're a mad killer?

408
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,236
You know I'm not.

409
00:26:35,702 --> 00:26:36,512
It's true.

410
00:26:38,418 --> 00:26:40,791
So now that we've got that sorted,

411
00:26:41,081 --> 00:26:43,377
what you want to do?
Sleep a little now? (sleep on my own ???)

412
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:45,495
It seems that somebody wants you dead.

413
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:49,180
Oh what's new???, welcome to my world.

414
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:52,750
I came to your room unseen.

415
00:26:53,811 --> 00:26:56,339
If the killer is half as good as me,

416
00:26:56,817 --> 00:26:58,032
he will do the same.

417
00:26:59,653 --> 00:27:01,543
And your point is?

418
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,180
I can  ***  for you

419
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:11,203
Two questions:

420
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:13,981
how?

421
00:27:15,736 --> 00:27:17,145
and why?

422
00:27:17,526 --> 00:27:19,803
Right through Nettlestone village,

423
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:23,812
parade yourself. Make sure everybody
knows you're there.

424
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:26,528
That will draw out the killer,

425
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:28,472
and my men will shoot him.

426
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,150
-What about my men?
-Cause mine are invisible.

427
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,907
And supposing...

428
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,203
I agree,

429
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:41,061
why?

430
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:46,532
Innocent people are being killed.

431
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:49,368
I cannot allow that.

432
00:27:52,451 --> 00:27:53,820
-Oh come on, oh Robin.

433
00:27:56,811 --> 00:27:58,412
It's been a talk, isn't it?

434
00:28:00,989 --> 00:28:03,073
Oh come on, you can be honest with me.

435
00:28:03,864 --> 00:28:05,716
It's not the real reason is it?

436
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,494
Do you want to know what the real reason is?

437
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,654
Nobody loves you anymore,

438
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:15,702
They've turned against you,

439
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:17,091
common serves.

440
00:28:19,495 --> 00:28:20,338
And really,

441
00:28:20,769 --> 00:28:22,891
those are the people who love
you the most.

442
00:28:23,064 --> 00:28:24,839
That's why you can't allow that.

443
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:26,865
Do we have an agreement?

444
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:29,170
that touched the saor??? (la corde sensible)

445
00:28:29,343 --> 00:28:30,598
I'll take that as yes

446
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:33,317
By the way,

447
00:28:33,896 --> 00:28:35,902
this is for you.

448
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,661
for future reference.

449
00:28:39,529 --> 00:28:41,420
Anybody wearing one
of those

450
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:42,655
is with me.

451
00:28:44,849 --> 00:28:46,122
That's sweet.

452
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,376
Robin,

453
00:28:47,932 --> 00:28:49,186
does it go with my dress?

454
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:53,893
This is my favor (for) saving your life.

455
00:29:22,814 --> 00:29:24,454
I'm sorry my lady.

456
00:29:26,518 --> 00:29:27,290
So,

457
00:29:27,406 --> 00:29:29,239
this is you with your hair down.

458
00:29:30,357 --> 00:29:31,360
You cannot be here.

459
00:29:35,296 --> 00:29:37,341
Do not me such a spouse, [poor] Marian*.

460
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:45,324
Listen, I've been trying to think about
who could've done this.

461
00:29:45,455 --> 00:29:47,983
I think the killer is the fortnight (?) the Master at Arms.

462
00:29:48,523 --> 00:29:49,429
Because....?

463
00:29:49,584 --> 00:29:51,552
He was right there when the maid was killed.

464
00:29:51,874 --> 00:29:55,578
And think about it, a murder on the loose
merely consolidate its position.

465
00:29:55,887 --> 00:29:57,909
The situation is in his interests.

466
00:29:58,025 --> 00:30:00,166
Well I tend to change this situation.

467
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:02,886
You think just because you want 
to change things you can't.

468
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:05,622
You saw the change at things
you do not want to change.

469
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:07,474
What about just getting away while you can?

470
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:08,130
Why?

471
00:30:08,593 --> 00:30:10,194
While We're having so much fun.

472
00:30:10,538 --> 00:30:12,004
Does anything touch you Robin?

473
00:30:12,969 --> 00:30:14,126
What does that mean?

474
00:30:14,223 --> 00:30:16,866
It means you're wandering around
as if nothing could hurt you.

475
00:30:17,078 --> 00:30:18,988
As if arrows would bounce off you.

476
00:30:19,105 --> 00:30:21,112
I don't think I've ever seen you hurt.

477
00:30:21,768 --> 00:30:23,311
Oh I've been hurt.

478
00:30:23,828 --> 00:30:24,793
Tell me.

479
00:30:27,648 --> 00:30:28,459
See,

480
00:30:29,443 --> 00:30:31,854
you think it is strong not to feel.

481
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:34,432
But if you cannot feel,

482
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,612
how can you
understand what others feel?

483
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,483
How could you be a all(home)??? man?

484
00:30:38,561 --> 00:30:40,798
I feel when innocent people are shot down,

485
00:30:41,281 --> 00:30:43,364
I feel when my men are hunted
like animals

486
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:46,257
I feel when good people turn against me.

487
00:30:48,302 --> 00:30:50,714
I was talking about you to someone today,

488
00:30:51,389 --> 00:30:52,431
a good man.

490
00:30:53,177 --> 00:30:55,762
Someone who still
remembers you from
the old days.

489
00:30:58,675 --> 00:31:01,473
And you know there are still people who love you.

490
00:31:03,938 --> 00:31:05,732
-My lady
-One moment

491
00:31:05,844 --> 00:31:06,963
-I must search your room.
-Go!

492
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:07,966
Out!

493
00:31:09,123 --> 00:31:11,265
By the way, your investigations,

494
00:31:12,322 --> 00:31:13,190
good work!

495
00:31:15,544 --> 00:31:17,145
Let's see if you're right tomorrow.

496
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,402
My lady!

497
00:31:21,019 --> 00:31:23,045
You had the sheriff to call off the dogs?

498
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,739
How?

499
00:31:26,938 --> 00:31:28,057
Pillow talk.

500
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,021
He'd been in bed with the sheriff.

501
00:31:30,619 --> 00:31:31,738
I've broken* a deal.

502
00:31:32,953 --> 00:31:35,384
We do not deal with the sheriff.

503
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:37,927
Tomorrow,

504
00:31:38,849 --> 00:31:40,006
we save his life.

505
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:40,894
What?

506
00:31:41,164 --> 00:31:42,939
Can't we argue about that tomorrow?

507
00:31:43,325 --> 00:31:45,273
Today, if there are no dogs,

508
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:46,775
I would like to sleep.

509
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,337
No, I have a better idea.

510
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,241
Another one.

511
00:31:49,356 --> 00:31:52,405
If it's as good as saving the sheriff's life,
I'm with Cheese Boy!

512
00:31:52,658 --> 00:31:54,858
Did they find the food we stored
about  the long* stone?

513
00:31:57,072 --> 00:31:58,403
If we were killers,

514
00:31:58,573 --> 00:31:59,769
we would bring them food,

515
00:32:00,213 --> 00:32:01,737
It proves we're not killers.

516
00:32:01,814 --> 00:32:02,798
But they hate us!

517
00:32:05,308 --> 00:32:08,126
Now the mill is closed,
the village will be suffering.

518
00:32:08,665 --> 00:32:09,784
They will be hungry.

519
00:32:11,709 --> 00:32:13,137
You just want everyone to love you.

520
00:32:13,253 --> 00:32:15,394
No I don't want to be branded a killer.

521
00:32:15,529 --> 00:32:17,536
-It is different!
-You want to be loved!

522
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,895
And I'll tell you something,

523
00:32:20,368 --> 00:32:21,352
it's not fair.

524
00:32:22,062 --> 00:32:24,338
I love you,
but no one gives me any food.

525
00:32:24,589 --> 00:32:26,191
And people who do not love you are fed.

526
00:32:27,286 --> 00:32:27,923
come on!

527
00:32:28,058 --> 00:32:29,138
The world is wrong.

528
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,646
We're feeding people who do not love us, and

529
00:32:31,932 --> 00:32:33,668
...saving a man who wants us dead.

530
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:35,868
I changed my mind,

531
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:37,986
I no longer love you.

532
00:32:38,155 --> 00:32:39,332
Now can I eat?

533
00:33:22,578 --> 00:33:23,948
I am no killer.

534
00:33:26,452 --> 00:33:28,902
I bring food to show my good will.

535
00:33:33,087 --> 00:33:34,245
I am your friend.

536
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:39,473
My men are tired and hungry.

537
00:33:43,656 --> 00:33:45,353
This is the last of our food.

538
00:33:53,704 --> 00:33:54,379
Owen?

539
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:57,436
You were using us,

540
00:33:58,455 --> 00:33:59,478
you and the sheriff.

541
00:34:00,693 --> 00:34:01,407
I am not.

542
00:34:01,924 --> 00:34:04,934
Fightin' your own personal battles, 
using us as pawns.

543
00:34:06,496 --> 00:34:08,368
What gift will you 
bring us later?

544
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:12,771
Fellow englishmen,

545
00:34:13,254 --> 00:34:15,183
Your sheriff and I bring you a gift,

546
00:34:15,723 --> 00:34:18,540
that gift is the 
reminder that we are free,

547
00:34:18,922 --> 00:34:20,600
and we should walk free.

548
00:34:22,255 --> 00:34:23,031
Today,

549
00:34:23,702 --> 00:34:25,844
Your sheriff and I share no fear.

550
00:34:26,959 --> 00:34:28,965
Today we defy Robin Hood.

551
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:30,582
Today,

552
00:34:30,949 --> 00:34:33,206
we walk among you to show that life goes on.

553
00:34:33,755 --> 00:34:35,048
We will not hide,

554
00:34:35,469 --> 00:34:37,981
or cower*,
in the face of our laws.

555
00:34:39,733 --> 00:34:43,649
We will not change our lives
 to suit their campaigns of terror.

556
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:47,378
We hold our 
heads high.

557
00:34:48,728 --> 00:34:50,407
Laws exist to protect us.

558
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,278
If we allow Robin Hood to flaw this laws,
if we...

559
00:34:53,818 --> 00:34:57,484
support him when he 
undermines basic justice, to take in flour or bread,*

560
00:34:58,082 --> 00:34:59,162
Then where we'll stop?

561
00:35:02,525 --> 00:35:05,014
We'd give him the right to ignore another law,
and another.

562
00:35:05,126 --> 00:35:06,052
and finally

563
00:35:06,322 --> 00:35:08,251
to condon(condemn) the take of a human life.*

564
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,473
But that too is a law made to protect us.

565
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:13,965
Your sheriff and I,

566
00:35:14,351 --> 00:35:15,605
share your horror

567
00:35:15,865 --> 00:35:18,759
of the murder of
innocents and we are here today,

568
00:35:19,453 --> 00:35:20,727
to show that we are united....

569
00:35:47,609 --> 00:35:49,461
What do you think you're doing?

570
00:35:49,731 --> 00:35:51,679
You're killing innocent people?

571
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:53,242
What can of a man are you?

572
00:35:58,503 --> 00:35:59,468
Marian!

573
00:36:03,346 --> 00:36:04,619
You're the Night Watchman?

574
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,140
There's no time for this,

575
00:36:06,294 --> 00:36:08,686
I know who's trying to kill the sheriff.
It's Joe.

576
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:10,828
Joe Lacey?

577
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:14,820
Joe!

578
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:19,836
Put it down.

579
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:22,938
Put the bow down, Joe!

580
00:36:26,179 --> 00:36:29,092
-You'll let me do this, Robin
-Why did you kill them Joe?

581
00:36:31,037 --> 00:36:32,561
My Ruth,

582
00:36:33,584 --> 00:36:35,783
she worked all her life in the castle.

583
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,770
When she laid dying,

584
00:36:39,252 --> 00:36:41,567
Where was the sheriff? 
Did he come to visit?

585
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:42,995
Did he send food?

586
00:36:44,497 --> 00:36:44,960
No.

587
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,124
He sent Joderic,

588
00:36:47,256 --> 00:36:48,915
because we hadn't paid our taxes,

589
00:36:48,992 --> 00:36:52,098
he put us out 
and she died like a dog on the street.

590
00:36:52,562 --> 00:36:53,932
And now, so we're leaving.

591
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:55,553
You kill the sheriff,

592
00:36:55,877 --> 00:36:57,382
Prince John will send another one,

593
00:36:57,729 --> 00:37:01,105
and the people of 
this village will be tortured because the sheriff died there.

594
00:37:01,622 --> 00:37:02,413
It's just me then.

595
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,259
But am I the only man in Nottignham 
who can say what he likes, do what he likes?

596
00:37:08,332 --> 00:37:10,107
Matthew, the miller's boy!

597
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,325
That was an accident, the sheriff moved.

598
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,409
And the sheriff moved the next day,

599
00:37:14,585 --> 00:37:17,518
when you killed 3 more stable boys and 
washer women.

600
00:37:19,968 --> 00:37:21,319
The sheriff's leaving.

601
00:37:21,434 --> 00:37:23,499
Let me do this terrible thing Robin.

602
00:37:23,727 --> 00:37:24,247
No.

603
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,350
Put it down.

604
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:30,893
Joe, put it down.

605
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:33,574
I will shoot you.

606
00:37:54,602 --> 00:37:55,702
I did it Ruth.

607
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:58,750
I shot the Sheriff.

608
00:38:01,097 --> 00:38:02,467
No,

609
00:38:03,644 --> 00:38:05,245
you shot the deputy,

610
00:38:05,998 --> 00:38:07,908
my look-alike.

611
00:38:27,026 --> 00:38:28,145
Poor Joe.

612
00:38:29,264 --> 00:38:30,884
I understand his grief.

613
00:38:31,575 --> 00:38:33,273
But why did he kill so many?

614
00:38:34,488 --> 00:38:35,337
He didn't.

615
00:38:37,204 --> 00:38:38,188
Well who did?

616
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:39,693
Let's go.

617
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:01,981
What now, Locksley?

618
00:39:03,061 --> 00:39:05,434
I want to kill you, I'm going to kill you,
I mean it!

619
00:39:05,666 --> 00:39:06,920
You coward, I mean it.

620
00:39:07,016 --> 00:39:10,142
Lacey had no reason to kill stable boys and washer women,

621
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:11,862
but you did.

622
00:39:13,155 --> 00:39:15,856
It suited you to have people think I was the killer.

623
00:39:16,531 --> 00:39:18,653
 Interesting idea. I wish I

624
00:39:18,827 --> 00:39:19,463
You did!

625
00:39:20,849 --> 00:39:21,717
Admit it!

626
00:39:22,431 --> 00:39:23,878
How could I admit it?

627
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:27,196
you swore they would kill me
if I ever did something* today.*

628
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:30,311
And I meant it.

629
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:33,784
That's why,

630
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,980
no one will ever know.

631
00:39:55,868 --> 00:39:57,431
My lord let me have some of my men after him.

632
00:39:57,585 --> 00:40:00,440
-No, too late for that, 
But I do have another job for you.

633
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:09,669
Gisbourne, It's you.

634
00:40:11,196 --> 00:40:12,490
Excuse me.

635
00:40:14,322 --> 00:40:16,316
I just came to inform you that...

636
00:40:17,178 --> 00:40:19,352
I'm to be the new Master of Arms.

637
00:40:22,393 --> 00:40:23,723
I don't believe you.

638
00:40:24,621 --> 00:40:26,184
I need to ear that,

639
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:28,052
from the sheriff himself.

640
00:40:28,399 --> 00:40:31,237
That will not be possible,
I'm afraid.

641
00:40:33,794 --> 00:40:36,866
I have been a loyal servant.

642
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:38,901
I have...

643
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,434
What?

644
00:40:43,434 --> 00:40:45,338
I've even killed for him.

645
00:40:46,506 --> 00:40:48,877
Yeah, the sheriff thought
you might have said that.

646
00:40:50,188 --> 00:40:51,828
Wich is why,

647
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:54,954
I am to be the new Master of Arms.

648
00:41:12,999 --> 00:41:14,239
Can I ask you a question?

649
00:41:15,196 --> 00:41:17,118
Why did they call you the Night Watchman,

650
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,861
when you come out on the day?

660
00:41:19,424 --> 00:41:20,591
I don't normally.*

661
00:41:21,112 --> 00:41:22,460
You know I can't be seen.

662
00:41:23,058 --> 00:41:24,854
And I did not choose the name.

663
00:41:25,465 --> 00:41:26,435
Anyway,

664
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,465
You did not mean* to do it anymore.

665
00:41:29,147 --> 00:41:30,351
... day or night.

666
00:41:30,626 --> 00:41:32,153
Now you hate* me.

667
00:41:32,476 --> 00:41:33,716
Yes.

668
00:41:34,799 --> 00:41:36,991
My father had me taught to fight.

669
00:41:37,565 --> 00:41:39,685
You want to *** have choices in the world.*

670
00:41:40,386 --> 00:41:42,757
and I choose to help the poor.

671
00:41:42,979 --> 00:41:45,763
Cute* on about to stop me doing that.

672
00:41:45,889 --> 00:41:47,972
But does your father know what* you're doing?

673
00:41:49,877 --> 00:41:52,475
(he)Thinks I enjoy embroidery.

674
00:41:56,216 --> 00:41:57,186
Give me a moment.

675
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,629
I've a mill to open.

676
00:42:31,907 --> 00:42:32,877
Take this.

677
00:42:35,003 --> 00:42:36,260
It's for you and Owen,

678
00:42:37,398 --> 00:42:38,907
in memory of your son.

679
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:49,511
John!

680
00:43:09,496 --> 00:43:11,778
I hereby declare this mill,

681
00:43:11,975 --> 00:43:13,646
open for business!

682
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:27,446
He has to have the glory,
doesn't he?

683
00:43:28,704 --> 00:43:29,638
Glory?

684
00:43:30,931 --> 00:43:31,793
No.

685
00:43:33,590 --> 00:43:35,422
I think he just wants to be loved.
