00:00:00,035 --> 00:00:02,347
LOCKSLEY VILLAGE

2
00:00:03,238 --> 00:00:05,781
Come on, pay up your taxes.

3
00:00:05,966 --> 00:00:08,401
Guards, take this to the Sheriff.

4
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:12,687
Taxes, we do not like.

5
00:00:15,694 --> 00:00:17,719
Well done, lads!

6
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,780
Hello, there.

7
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:27,229
We're winning.

8
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,929
Sorry, my Lord.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,454
Come on, we are really winning.

10
00:00:36,535 --> 00:00:38,582
And there's one more prize.

11
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:40,709
If we really wanna
beat the Sheriff...

12
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:44,420
NOTTINGHAM CASTLE

13
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,505
How do we know there
even is a Strong Room?

14
00:00:58,506 --> 00:01:00,424
- A wild guess.
- How do you think?

15
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:01,580
A little bird told him.

16
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:03,776
A little Marian bird. Mmmm.

17
00:01:05,268 --> 00:01:06,665
This is it.

18
00:01:11,077 --> 00:01:12,060
Djaq.

19
00:01:13,089 --> 00:01:13,967
This?

20
00:01:14,499 --> 00:01:16,198
It's just a door.

21
00:01:16,316 --> 00:01:17,747
No handle, no lock.

22
00:01:21,197 --> 00:01:22,192
Robin!

23
00:01:24,296 --> 00:01:26,030
I do not like this.

24
00:01:26,145 --> 00:01:27,001
Will?

25
00:01:34,948 --> 00:01:37,329
- Will, what's this?
- Much, don't touch that!

26
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,024
Why do I do it?!

27
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,453
- Right, let's check it out...
- Wait !

28
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:45,517
Look, look, look!

29
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:47,743
Turn it! Turn it! Turn it!

30
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:54,082
What is this?

31
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:56,764
The Sheriff's war chest.

32
00:01:58,024 --> 00:02:00,524
And that, is our poor chest, lads!

33
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:06,496
We're not equipped for this.

34
00:02:06,497 --> 00:02:08,079
Robin! Dogs!

35
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,783
I know. But we'll be back.

36
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:17,243
DEEP IN THE HEART OF ENGLAND

37
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,889
LIVES A LEGEND

38
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:26,952
ROBIN HOOD

39
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:29,187
Subtitles by The SubWood Team

40
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:34,669
Resynched and adapted
by ScarHand

41
00:02:50,475 --> 00:02:52,405
EPISODE 2
BOOBY AND THE BEAST

42
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,209
Am I to drown
in everybody else's incompetence,

43
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:59,666
whilst Robin Hood steals everything
that is rightfully mine?!

44
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,192
A clue : no!

45
00:03:01,562 --> 00:03:03,516
Do something about it, Gisborne!

46
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,186
My Lord, we now know
the Strong Room works.

47
00:03:06,187 --> 00:03:07,836
It stopped Hood dead in his tracks.

48
00:03:07,837 --> 00:03:09,478
Not dead enough!

49
00:03:10,588 --> 00:03:12,796
Stealing our money from me
on the way here is one thing.

50
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:16,323
Stealing it from right under
my very nose is another!

51
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,616
The Black Knights are coming,
expecting their share out, Gisborne!

52
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:22,115
At this rate, there'll be
nothing left to share!

53
00:03:23,248 --> 00:03:25,753
I want Hood caught, Gisborne.

54
00:03:25,754 --> 00:03:27,922
I want him dead!

55
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:33,181
Meanwhile, how's your German?

56
00:03:33,182 --> 00:03:36,476
- German?
- Pat, woman, pat! Don't rub.

57
00:03:37,424 --> 00:03:40,418
- Ah, this guest you're expecting?
- Yes.

58
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:42,716
Count Friedrich of Bavaria

59
00:03:42,717 --> 00:03:46,323
is one of the richest aristocrats
in Europe, by all accounts.

60
00:03:46,358 --> 00:03:48,052
And stupid too. So...

61
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:50,087
You and he should get on.

62
00:03:50,088 --> 00:03:52,422
He also has a weakness for gambling.

63
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,825
- Your alterations to the Great Hall?
- Yes.

64
00:03:55,213 --> 00:03:58,819
We will extend the count
every courtesy, Gisborne.

65
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,524
I've taken my bath six
months early for a reason.

66
00:04:01,559 --> 00:04:05,427
And then we shall
take the inbred booby

67
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,277
for every penny he's got.

68
00:04:11,992 --> 00:04:14,639
LOCKSLEY MANOR

69
00:04:23,294 --> 00:04:26,646
The Sheriff wanted me to thank
you all for your hard work,

70
00:04:26,647 --> 00:04:28,600
building his new Strong Room.

71
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,939
Slave labour, more like.
Where's our money?

72
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:36,102
You'll get what's coming to you.

73
00:04:37,998 --> 00:04:39,624
Now...

74
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:44,847
How did Robin Hood
find out about the Strong Room?

75
00:04:46,861 --> 00:04:50,086
Somebody... must have told him.

76
00:04:52,676 --> 00:04:55,792
Loose talk costs lives.

77
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:07,776
Good. Very good.

78
00:05:09,348 --> 00:05:12,247
This world is full of idiots,

79
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:15,033
waiting to be parted
from their money.

80
00:05:15,056 --> 00:05:16,680
But, as you know...

81
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:20,622
...the house always wins.

82
00:05:22,659 --> 00:05:24,949
Now, I've had this table
put here in the middle,

83
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,446
because dice is the
count's favourite game,

84
00:05:27,447 --> 00:05:30,694
and this is the first thing
I want him to see when he arrives.

85
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,266
Good. Carry on.

86
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:40,048
Ah! Lady Marian,
there you are.

87
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:44,203
Now, our guest
is due to arrive shortly,

88
00:05:44,204 --> 00:05:48,735
and I'd like you to
be a friend to him.

89
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,400
I'd like you to make
him feel that his every desire

90
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:53,729
is yours to obey.

91
00:05:54,065 --> 00:05:55,952
Every desire?

92
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,320
Show him a good time.

93
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,809
- What do you think, Gisborne?
- Good idea.

94
00:06:03,456 --> 00:06:04,681
No, I won't!

95
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,580
Yes, you will, missy.

96
00:06:08,066 --> 00:06:10,135
How's your father, so to speak?

97
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:11,324
Frail.

98
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,823
House arrest doesn't help.

99
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,670
But very much alive.

100
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,086
What if he sees my heart isn't in it?

101
00:06:23,087 --> 00:06:24,220
Well, then pretend.

102
00:06:24,221 --> 00:06:26,601
Deception comes
easily enough to you.

103
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:30,772
Now, when the count arrives,
I want you to smile for him,

104
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:33,721
and buy yourself a gown that...

105
00:06:33,722 --> 00:06:34,894
how shall I say?

106
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:37,669
Stimulates the imagination.

107
00:06:41,638 --> 00:06:43,858
The cheaper the better, I think.

108
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:51,960
Fetch.

109
00:06:59,705 --> 00:07:01,543
Stand further off.

110
00:07:01,994 --> 00:07:04,946
You make me feel
as if I am under arrest.

111
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,381
Trinkets for the lovely lady?

112
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,936
You call this fresh?!

113
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:24,160
You can't expect
people to eat this muck!

114
00:07:27,784 --> 00:07:30,783
Hey! Stop it!
What are you doing?!

115
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:35,761
- They have you well guarded.
- Why did I choose this?

116
00:07:35,762 --> 00:07:38,480
I can hardly breathe in there. Shhh.

117
00:07:38,676 --> 00:07:39,624
What happened?

118
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,892
They're expecting a guest
today, a rich German count,

119
00:07:42,893 --> 00:07:45,507
and they're making me fawn over him, making me dress up...

120
00:07:45,508 --> 00:07:46,681
A German?

121
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:49,918
Do you thing the Sheriff and Prince
John looking for allies abroad?

122
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,831
He's not an ally, he's a gambler.

123
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:54,662
The Sheriff has set up
gaming tables in the castle.

124
00:07:54,663 --> 00:07:57,680
He's planning to fill his new
Strong Room with the count's money.

125
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:59,033
You see?

126
00:07:59,322 --> 00:08:02,166
Another good reason to rob him.

127
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:04,590
Robin, please,
do not go down there, it's dangerous.

128
00:08:04,591 --> 00:08:05,927
You know me.

129
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,340
I like a challenge.

130
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:12,337
You don't have to do this!

131
00:08:12,338 --> 00:08:13,527
Yes, I do.

132
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:16,221
Without me, you wouldn't even
know there was a Strong Room.

133
00:08:16,222 --> 00:08:18,261
- "England needs me?"
- Yes.

134
00:08:18,262 --> 00:08:21,556
England needs me.
England needs us.

135
00:08:21,557 --> 00:08:23,164
And I need you.

136
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:29,436
Guard?

137
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:32,460
We need to break
into the Strong Room,

138
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:35,072
and Stephen was the first person
I thought of.

139
00:08:35,073 --> 00:08:38,555
- Is he a friend of your father's?
- A teacher. A legend in his day.

140
00:08:38,556 --> 00:08:41,295
He doesn't work anymore
but he used to be famous.

141
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:42,994
He worked in the Orient.

142
00:08:43,376 --> 00:08:46,224
They were his apprentices
Gisborne's lot killed this morning.

143
00:08:47,357 --> 00:08:48,397
Will?

144
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,899
Still passionate? Angry?

145
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:59,061
- A lot to be angry about.
- True. And your skills?

146
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,392
You're using them, not wasting them?

147
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,835
- I'm with Robin Hood.
- Good.

148
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:07,065
That is not a waste.

149
00:09:10,405 --> 00:09:12,809
Do not touch that, please.

150
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,295
I have seen this
type of work before.

151
00:09:15,296 --> 00:09:16,146
It is Persian, no?

152
00:09:16,147 --> 00:09:18,534
It was my wife's.

153
00:09:21,685 --> 00:09:25,431
The men who died had
families, wives and children.

154
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:27,951
I want them to be taken care of.

155
00:09:27,952 --> 00:09:30,950
They will be. You have my word.

156
00:09:32,231 --> 00:09:34,867
If there is any information
you can give us...

157
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:39,280
- anything that they told you...
- Look, I'm not being funny...

158
00:09:39,281 --> 00:09:41,362
We've seen this death trap
in action, right?

159
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,801
And now we're gonna take
advice from a blind man?

160
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:49,116
When a man loses his sight,

161
00:09:49,117 --> 00:09:52,796
he finds compensation
in the senses that remain.

162
00:09:59,478 --> 00:10:01,986
I do not intend
on joining your mission.

163
00:10:02,634 --> 00:10:04,449
But I might be of assistance
in planning it.

164
00:10:04,454 --> 00:10:07,680
Yes, but what can you possibly know
about the Sheriff's Strong Room?

165
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:08,652
A great deal.

166
00:10:10,398 --> 00:10:11,843
I designed it.

167
00:10:12,444 --> 00:10:15,289
NOTTINGHAM TOWN

168
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:51,082
Marian.

169
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,279
Who'd have thought?

170
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,764
Ah! Count Friedrich!

171
00:10:55,765 --> 00:10:57,465
Welcome to Nottingham.

172
00:10:57,466 --> 00:11:00,782
Tell me, are all the
roads in England so bad?

173
00:11:00,806 --> 00:11:02,816
I feel like I've been
beaten like an egg.

174
00:11:02,817 --> 00:11:05,239
Your safety was my first concern.

175
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,834
I organised the route
so as to avoid the forest.

176
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,622
We couldn't have your
fortune or your good self

177
00:11:11,623 --> 00:11:13,426
falling into outlaws' hands.

178
00:11:13,427 --> 00:11:18,810
Myself and my men are a match
for any rustic ruffian, I assure you.

179
00:11:28,508 --> 00:11:32,794
Had I known what awaited me here,
I would have employed winged horses.

180
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:37,543
Lady Marian has made it
her personal responsibility

181
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:41,814
to make sure your stay
is as comfortable as possible.

182
00:11:41,815 --> 00:11:42,890
Really?

183
00:11:42,891 --> 00:11:45,620
I'm very happy to
make your acquaintance.

184
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:46,568
Oh, come, come,

185
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:49,903
acquaintances are for
old ladies and priests.

186
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:52,656
We will dispense
with such formalities.

187
00:11:52,657 --> 00:11:54,493
I am already your friend,

188
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:57,269
and always your servant.

189
00:12:01,022 --> 00:12:02,756
Do be careful there!

190
00:12:02,757 --> 00:12:04,502
Take the chest to my rooms.

191
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:11,766
It's a few shillings
for the gaming tables.

192
00:12:11,767 --> 00:12:14,540
Tell me, do you play, Lady Marian?

193
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,481
Such pursuits are not
entirely to my tastes.

194
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:21,238
Then we must find pursuits
that excite you more!

195
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,676
Tell me, do you ride?

196
00:12:29,425 --> 00:12:31,552
Come on, come on.

197
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:43,388
Leaving so soon?

198
00:12:47,774 --> 00:12:48,992
I got your message.

199
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:51,073
What have you got for me?

200
00:12:53,535 --> 00:12:56,715
Robin wants to have
another go at your Strong Room.

201
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,847
Obviously. And?

202
00:13:00,923 --> 00:13:04,373
Well, that's it.
It'll be the next few days though,

203
00:13:04,374 --> 00:13:07,159
- so you'd better be ready.
- Don't waste my time.

204
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,926
I don't pay for obvious.

205
00:13:09,145 --> 00:13:11,064
You'll have to do better than that.

206
00:13:11,654 --> 00:13:12,741
Like what?

207
00:13:13,974 --> 00:13:17,235
Who told Robin Hood
about the Strong Room?

208
00:13:21,246 --> 00:13:22,738
I don't know.

209
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:25,119
I don't. Honest.

210
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:27,998
It's early days in our relationship.

211
00:13:28,194 --> 00:13:30,804
But come to me again with nothing,

212
00:13:30,805 --> 00:13:32,779
and I will be very disappointed.

213
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,834
- Understand?
- Yeah. Got it.

214
00:13:39,205 --> 00:13:41,127
Don't make me wait too long.

215
00:13:50,411 --> 00:13:52,874
The designs were not meant
for the Sheriff.

216
00:13:52,875 --> 00:13:54,630
They were a commission.

217
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:57,094
- By whom?
- A Persian general.

218
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,828
I did not complete the work,

219
00:13:58,829 --> 00:14:01,462
but I kept the plans with me always.

220
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,780
Then, not long ago, my apprentice
sold them to the Sheriff.

221
00:14:05,243 --> 00:14:08,061
His family was starving,
I can't blame him.

222
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:09,430
He died for it.

223
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:13,315
No expense has been
spared for your gambling pleasure.

224
00:14:13,316 --> 00:14:17,631
Food, drink, company.

225
00:14:17,632 --> 00:14:21,550
We aim to please in every respect,
isn't that right, Marian?

226
00:14:22,868 --> 00:14:24,624
Is this your idea of sport?

227
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,858
You do not like the skittles,
my lady?

228
00:14:26,859 --> 00:14:29,091
But it is a charming game.

229
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:31,356
A child's game, surely?

230
00:14:31,357 --> 00:14:34,508
Do men really waste their money
playing this?

231
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:37,187
No waste if the prize
is worth having.

232
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:40,482
Come, let me show you.
Gently caress the ball...

233
00:14:41,647 --> 00:14:44,005
Danke schön. Thank you.

234
00:14:46,975 --> 00:14:49,958
Forgive me, Count Friedrich,
my aim was a little wide.

235
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:54,898
This is the door,

236
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,244
the only entrance or exit.
There's no windows.

237
00:14:57,605 --> 00:15:00,865
The room itself is
20 feet long by 20 feet wide.

238
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:02,841
Both walls are
honeycombed with blow holes,

239
00:15:02,842 --> 00:15:04,576
each loaded with arrows,

240
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:06,531
primed to strike a specific spot.

241
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:08,982
You step on the wrong stone and...

242
00:15:11,269 --> 00:15:14,770
- Which stones?
- My great innovation.

243
00:15:16,032 --> 00:15:17,165
It changes.

244
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,253
Well, that's not possible. Is it?

245
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,582
A weighted wheel beneath
the floor rotates regularly.

246
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:30,195
Each turn defines a new route,

247
00:15:30,368 --> 00:15:33,294
changing the order
of the sprung stones.

248
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:39,934
So, any stone can trigger a trap
at any time?

249
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:42,366
I did not say it would be easy.

250
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,926
This, I do not like.

251
00:15:49,092 --> 00:15:52,456
Come, Lady Marian,
bring me some luck.

252
00:15:52,457 --> 00:15:54,738
- Where've you been?
- An errand.

253
00:15:54,739 --> 00:15:57,686
He's quite taken with her.
Encourage him.

254
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:59,275
He'll lose quicker.

255
00:16:03,905 --> 00:16:07,522
Marian just needs a little coaxing.
It's her way.

256
00:16:07,523 --> 00:16:09,869
She says no when she means yes.

257
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,164
Really?

258
00:16:11,364 --> 00:16:13,814
Then I shall relish the challenge.

259
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:20,886
Lady Marian, I cannot roll
unless you help me.

260
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:25,228
- No, thank you.
- No, no, Lady Marian, I insist.

261
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,469
- Lady Marian wins!
- You see?! I win!

262
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,197
Perhaps you will excuse me.
I have a headache.

263
00:16:48,198 --> 00:16:50,211
Oh, how terrible for you.

264
00:16:50,212 --> 00:16:56,073
If I may, I find that gentle rubbing
of the temples is most effective.

265
00:16:56,074 --> 00:16:59,842
You are very kind,
but I think I will go and lie down.

266
00:16:59,843 --> 00:17:02,882
As hard as it is,
we must let you go.

267
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:05,339
Thank you
for your understanding, Count.

268
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:14,207
Quite the beauty.

269
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,959
I must confess, when I first
came to this country,

270
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,936
I thought I would not like it.

271
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:20,069
But now,

272
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:22,907
I like it very much!

273
00:17:30,618 --> 00:17:32,503
You'll be up against time.

274
00:17:32,896 --> 00:17:36,896
Opening the door turns an hourglass
set beside the base of the plinth.

275
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:41,647
When the sand runs through,
a final fail-safe is triggered.

276
00:17:41,648 --> 00:17:43,962
I shouldn't ask, but what, exactly?

277
00:17:43,963 --> 00:17:46,238
There is a vault
behind the back wall,

278
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,731
containing a vat of molten lead.

279
00:17:48,732 --> 00:17:52,128
It is kept at a constant heat
by the fires of the kitchen.

280
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:54,310
When the hourglass is empty,

281
00:17:54,311 --> 00:17:55,788
the vat is turned.

282
00:17:55,903 --> 00:17:58,619
The liquid
flows into a series of gutters.

283
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:02,726
- The pipes in the walls.
- Burning liquid sprays out,

284
00:18:02,727 --> 00:18:04,206
covering the entire room.

285
00:18:04,207 --> 00:18:06,784
Anyone inside
would not stand a chance.

286
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,068
And yet...

287
00:18:08,069 --> 00:18:12,432
the coins remain intact, because
they're harder than the soft lead!

288
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:17,968
Well, all I'm hearing is arrows,
lead and certain death.

289
00:18:18,303 --> 00:18:19,772
Encouraging!

290
00:18:21,043 --> 00:18:23,124
How long before the hourglass
runs through?

291
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:25,329
A slow count of eight score and ten.

292
00:18:25,421 --> 00:18:27,605
In a count of 170,

293
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,757
you've got to get to
the money and get it out?

294
00:18:29,758 --> 00:18:31,352
Nice of you to join us, Allan.

295
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:32,462
Well...

296
00:18:33,618 --> 00:18:35,079
I still think you're mad.

297
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,500
But if you want some more help...

298
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:37,887
We are mad!

299
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:40,419
We should stick to robbing
merchants in the forest!

300
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:41,725
That, we are good at.

301
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:45,309
Then we will work
until we get better at this!

302
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,563
We'll meet near the old barn, near Clun.

303
00:18:49,564 --> 00:18:50,454
What for?

304
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,922
To practise.

305
00:18:52,141 --> 00:18:55,813
We are going to build
this Strong Room over there.

306
00:18:57,445 --> 00:18:58,969
Good!

307
00:19:02,665 --> 00:19:05,012
- Excuse me, can I pass?
- Orders.

308
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:08,122
No-one passes, not even you.
Sheriff's private room.

309
00:19:08,123 --> 00:19:09,839
Lady Marian?

310
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:12,431
Oh, no!  Let me pass,
just this once. Please.

311
00:19:12,432 --> 00:19:14,014
Well, what's in it for me?

312
00:19:14,015 --> 00:19:17,599
Nice gown, very fetching.
A bit of a new look for you.

313
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,770
- How dare you?!
- I'm just being friendly.

314
00:19:22,252 --> 00:19:24,485
How about a little kiss?

315
00:19:25,004 --> 00:19:26,666
How about a little smack?!

316
00:19:28,033 --> 00:19:29,131
Excuse me!

317
00:19:31,825 --> 00:19:35,097
- You are an impressive fighter.
- Yes, I know.

318
00:19:35,098 --> 00:19:38,950
And you are also very
impressive in many ways.

319
00:19:38,951 --> 00:19:39,516
Please.

320
00:19:39,563 --> 00:19:42,904
- Are you not glad I came after you?
- I made no invitation.

321
00:19:43,436 --> 00:19:45,101
You feign a headache and retire.

322
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:46,326
I follow.

323
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:49,211
This is the way that
trysts are made all over the world.

324
00:19:49,458 --> 00:19:51,851
Well, this one is all over,
all right?

325
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:53,065
As of now.

326
00:19:53,504 --> 00:19:55,781
- Gisborne !
- I mustn't be found here.

327
00:19:55,782 --> 00:19:56,915
Quickly.

328
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:03,475
Come, quick!

329
00:20:06,565 --> 00:20:09,098
There should be a guard
on that door at all times.

330
00:20:09,099 --> 00:20:11,965
- I'll look into it immediately, my Lord.
- Wait.

331
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,370
First things, first.
Tomorrow's meeting. Come here.

332
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:21,680
There.

333
00:20:21,876 --> 00:20:26,894
I have outlined the division
of the money in my Strong Room.

334
00:20:28,523 --> 00:20:32,037
You will be in charge of making sure

335
00:20:32,049 --> 00:20:34,371
our friends, the Black Knights, get their share.

336
00:20:34,372 --> 00:20:36,603
You wish to strengthen our forces in the south?

337
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:39,986
- The share is generous.
- Strategy, Gisborne.

338
00:20:42,098 --> 00:20:45,624
The King is most likely
to land there on his return.

339
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,185
Besides...

340
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:53,869
there will be plenty of funds in the war
chest, after our German booby loses tonight.

341
00:20:54,158 --> 00:20:56,541
We'll make sure he loses big.

342
00:20:56,542 --> 00:21:00,148
- What if the count surprises us and wins?
- Wins?

343
00:21:00,437 --> 00:21:01,999
That buffoon?

344
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,890
"Oh, I feel like I've been
beaten as an egg."

345
00:21:05,925 --> 00:21:07,454
Mincey oaf.

346
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:09,871
But you have made
provision just in case?

347
00:21:09,872 --> 00:21:12,050
You know me too well, Gisborne.

348
00:21:12,051 --> 00:21:13,113
Of course.

349
00:21:14,015 --> 00:21:18,134
All eventualities
have been considered.

350
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,689
Dice that only roll one way.

351
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,135
In our favour.

352
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,271
Make sure Marian is with us tonight.

353
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:39,829
What does he think?

354
00:21:40,603 --> 00:21:44,409
That I will not be suspicious of
an invitation from a sheriff in...

355
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,565
Where are we?!

356
00:21:45,566 --> 00:21:48,089
That I will not do my homework
and find out who he is?

357
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:51,724
Does he think that his reputation
has not spread to Europe?

358
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:54,262
And you... you are in on this plan.

359
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:57,242
Do you think this is not the
first time I have been offered a girl...

360
00:21:57,243 --> 00:22:00,421
- to take my eyes from the table !?
- Let go of me!

361
00:22:00,641 --> 00:22:03,059
Do you people think
that I am a complete idiot?

362
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,713
Yes, until now. Which is
exactly what you wanted, isn't it?

363
00:22:06,724 --> 00:22:08,944
- What do you mean?
- Oh, come on.

364
00:22:08,945 --> 00:22:10,584
The way you fight.

365
00:22:10,585 --> 00:22:12,237
You're no booby.

366
00:22:12,572 --> 00:22:15,588
I don't think a booby
does homework on his hosts.

367
00:22:15,589 --> 00:22:18,183
It suits you to have
people think you're an idiot.

368
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:19,940
It helps sometimes.

369
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:23,125
People play less cautiously,
but I am no cheat.

370
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:25,817
And for what it's worth,
I am no lackey of the Sheriff.

371
00:22:26,684 --> 00:22:29,471
So, we are both players.

372
00:22:31,065 --> 00:22:32,276
And what will you do?

373
00:22:32,277 --> 00:22:34,079
Do? Leave.

374
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,263
If the Sheriff is loading the dice,
I cannot win.

375
00:22:36,264 --> 00:22:39,232
I will be struck
by a sudden illness.

376
00:22:40,603 --> 00:22:43,731
Don't leave. Help me.

377
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:45,650
Help you?

378
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:47,630
You heard the Sheriff.

379
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:50,206
He's using the money
to plot against the King.

380
00:22:50,784 --> 00:22:53,292
I have friends who would like
to relieve him of his money

381
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:55,025
before he distributes it.

382
00:22:55,026 --> 00:22:59,185
- And that will have to be tonight.
- This is a dangerous game.

383
00:23:00,568 --> 00:23:02,465
But you're a player.

384
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:10,696
The hourglass turns now! One...

385
00:23:10,697 --> 00:23:14,668
- Arrow!...
- Two, three, four, five...

386
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:15,878
- John, no!...
- six, seven...

387
00:23:15,879 --> 00:23:16,896
I am stone!

388
00:23:16,897 --> 00:23:19,234
- Not there John, no.
- Well, where?

389
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:21,269
- There!
- Hang on, stone? I thought he was pit?

390
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:25,146
- No, I'm pit!
- Stop! Please! Shut up!

391
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:30,478
Lives depend on this.

392
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:33,102
The wives and families of the dead.

393
00:23:33,451 --> 00:23:35,104
Not to mention
what will happen to England

394
00:23:35,105 --> 00:23:37,810
if the Sheriff
starts to give out that money.

395
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,967
If we are going to defeat
the Strong Room,

396
00:23:40,968 --> 00:23:43,654
then we have to work as a team,

397
00:23:43,655 --> 00:23:46,798
and that means discipline.

398
00:23:48,523 --> 00:23:50,535
What do you think you're doing?

399
00:23:51,483 --> 00:23:54,905
- You stay in the castle.
- Believe me, I would rather stay here.

400
00:23:54,906 --> 00:23:57,130
I am merely doing as I am instructed.

401
00:23:57,131 --> 00:23:59,615
The lady Marian
is to ride out with me.

402
00:24:00,448 --> 00:24:02,505
No, no, no, no.

403
00:24:02,506 --> 00:24:04,054
Well, if I do not ride,

404
00:24:04,055 --> 00:24:06,378
I might be out of sorts,
and if I'm out of sorts,

405
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:10,066
I might decide not to
play the tables at all tonight.

406
00:24:11,129 --> 00:24:12,551
Very well.

407
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:16,158
I will provide you with an escort.
Guards!

408
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:17,880
The forest
is a very dangerous place.

409
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:20,735
Sheriff, we are both
men of the world, ja?

410
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,296
Perhaps alone with nature, out in the
forest amongst the trees and flowers,

411
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:27,221
Lady Marian might
not play so hard to get.

412
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:29,332
No guards.

413
00:24:32,445 --> 00:24:33,935
Don't be late back.

414
00:24:45,144 --> 00:24:46,935
There is a way, you know.

415
00:24:46,936 --> 00:24:48,547
A way to what?

416
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:53,694
There is a way to do all the things
you need to do and still find love.

417
00:24:55,497 --> 00:24:57,693
You're a troubled soul.

418
00:24:57,694 --> 00:24:59,220
Be patient.

419
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:01,294
You will prevail.

420
00:25:03,195 --> 00:25:06,352
And you can tell all that
by just feeling my face?

421
00:25:06,353 --> 00:25:10,073
No. Your friend Much
was telling me earlier.

422
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:15,659
Now I'm better acquainted
with your Sheriff,

423
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:19,313
I begin to understand why you have
such admiration for this outlaw.

424
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:23,112
- It's not just me.
- I didn't mean just you.

425
00:25:23,113 --> 00:25:24,661
I think I would like to
take to the woods

426
00:25:24,662 --> 00:25:28,326
and fight injustice
like your Robin Hood.

427
00:25:28,767 --> 00:25:30,268
What do you think?

428
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:34,997
Why does a potential freedom fighter
waste his life gambling?

429
00:25:35,991 --> 00:25:37,684
I am a count.

430
00:25:37,685 --> 00:25:40,481
My life has been managed
since the day that I was born.

431
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:43,450
Tradition, etiquette...

432
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:44,775
It's all so safe.

433
00:25:44,776 --> 00:25:48,417
I crave danger.
You wouldn't understand.

434
00:25:48,533 --> 00:25:49,666
Don't be so sure.

435
00:26:01,555 --> 00:26:03,960
Are you sure you know
how to find these friends of yours?

436
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:06,050
I'm hoping they're gonna find us.

437
00:26:06,962 --> 00:26:08,615
They already have!

438
00:26:17,426 --> 00:26:18,825
Who's your new friend?

439
00:26:18,826 --> 00:26:21,727
Count Friedrich Berthold
Otto von Wittelsberg,

440
00:26:21,728 --> 00:26:23,854
from the German Duchy of Bavaria.

441
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:25,137
And your friend.

442
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:32,000
- This is the Sheriff's guest?
- Yes

443
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:34,116
And you trust him enough
to bring him here to meet me?

444
00:26:34,117 --> 00:26:36,206
- He wants to help us.
- Oh.

445
00:26:36,207 --> 00:26:39,362
It seems we have a
common desire, Robin Hood.

446
00:26:41,322 --> 00:26:44,776
I mean, we both wish to see
the Sheriff broken and humiliated.

447
00:26:44,996 --> 00:26:47,574
- Marian and I were discussing...
- First name terms!

448
00:26:47,575 --> 00:26:49,886
- Jealous?
- Of him?

449
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,173
Marian has a proposition for you.

450
00:26:53,174 --> 00:26:55,728
If you want to rob the Strong Room,
you have to do it tonight.

451
00:26:55,729 --> 00:26:57,259
Not possible.
We're not ready.

452
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:59,005
Well, then don't bother at all.

453
00:26:59,006 --> 00:27:01,111
The Sheriff will divide the
money between the Black Knights

454
00:27:01,112 --> 00:27:02,868
and they're coming tomorrow.

455
00:27:03,492 --> 00:27:05,758
After that the Strong Room
will be empty.

456
00:27:08,305 --> 00:27:09,476
I don't like that look.

457
00:27:09,626 --> 00:27:13,741
- That look means trouble.
- Robin, it's certain death.

458
00:27:13,742 --> 00:27:14,782
Well,

459
00:27:14,783 --> 00:27:17,130
if that money is going to be
used to finance weapons and men

460
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:18,552
to kill the King, then...

461
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:20,599
then we are dead already.

462
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,150
- Kiss me.
- What?

463
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:39,282
Otherwise what will they think
we've been doing all this time?

464
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:46,337
We have a budding
romance after all.

465
00:27:46,742 --> 00:27:48,834
So it would seem.

466
00:27:48,973 --> 00:27:51,069
Maybe one more,
to make it really convincing?

467
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,457
Careful.

468
00:27:52,884 --> 00:27:55,781
- Remember the skittles?
- Ah, ja.

469
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,584
He's succeeded where you failed,
Gisborne.

470
00:27:59,585 --> 00:28:01,089
So, come on...

471
00:28:01,124 --> 00:28:02,952
money to be made.

472
00:28:16,045 --> 00:28:17,751
You. Stop.

473
00:28:24,045 --> 00:28:27,993
I want the count's goblet filled at
all times tonight. You understand?

474
00:28:28,758 --> 00:28:29,857
Go on.

475
00:28:33,191 --> 00:28:34,451
Put it here.

476
00:28:38,839 --> 00:28:40,538
You know what to do.

477
00:28:42,041 --> 00:28:43,324
There.

478
00:28:43,325 --> 00:28:45,717
The money you lose
tonight goes into that.

479
00:28:45,819 --> 00:28:48,189
It connects directly to
the Strong Room below.

480
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,935
- Now, once it's in there...
- Ja, ja, I know.

481
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,975
Our outlaw friends
will steal it back for me.

482
00:28:52,976 --> 00:28:56,520
It seems unfair. No gambler
likes to lose, even on purpose.

483
00:28:56,521 --> 00:28:58,545
Well, if you win,

484
00:28:58,546 --> 00:29:01,512
the Sheriff will never let
you leave Nottingham alive.

485
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,265
I was running towards the
Great Hall and I tripped and I fell,

486
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:08,869
and I think I've hurt my ankle!
Look!

487
00:29:12,365 --> 00:29:14,850
Men are so obvious.

488
00:29:14,851 --> 00:29:17,516
- Now, play as long as you can.
- Ja.

489
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:20,694
Take your time, and then,

490
00:29:20,695 --> 00:29:24,154
when we get the
signal, start losing.

491
00:29:39,365 --> 00:29:40,889
Oh, I didn't recognise you!

492
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,369
- What?
- Nothing.

493
00:29:56,609 --> 00:29:59,477
- You wanna dress like a girl more often.
- Oh, I do, do I?

494
00:29:59,478 --> 00:30:01,465
It's just a thought.

495
00:30:06,845 --> 00:30:08,324
Count Friedrich.

496
00:30:08,325 --> 00:30:11,176
Ah! Fortune awaits, good luck!

497
00:30:12,263 --> 00:30:16,547
Lady Marian is my good
luck charm this evening.

498
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:17,460
You know, Gisborne,

499
00:30:17,461 --> 00:30:19,927
I have a new-found
respect for Marian.

500
00:30:19,928 --> 00:30:22,494
Are we to endure
this ritual at every turn?

501
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:25,380
Let him lose in his own way.

502
00:30:25,704 --> 00:30:29,107
And if he doesn't,
we'll switch the dice!

503
00:30:31,619 --> 00:30:33,214
I won!

504
00:30:33,215 --> 00:30:34,587
Throw.

505
00:30:35,978 --> 00:30:37,934
Count Friedrich wins!

506
00:30:42,012 --> 00:30:44,012
The count wins!

507
00:30:46,844 --> 00:30:48,635
The count wins!

508
00:30:55,639 --> 00:30:57,350
Again! I win!

509
00:31:04,062 --> 00:31:06,108
No dogs this time.

510
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:17,734
Where's the arrow?

511
00:31:17,735 --> 00:31:19,654
I don't know.

512
00:31:20,637 --> 00:31:22,198
Go on, Will.

513
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:40,831
Poison.

514
00:31:41,282 --> 00:31:42,891
That wasn't there before.

515
00:31:44,785 --> 00:31:46,778
They've changed the sequence.

516
00:31:47,564 --> 00:31:49,807
- Well, then we can't go on!
- Tonight is our only chance.

517
00:31:49,808 --> 00:31:52,214
It the sequence has changed,
our practising is for nothing!

518
00:31:52,215 --> 00:31:53,037
If we do not try,

519
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,011
then all the money in there
will be given to the Black Knights.

520
00:31:55,012 --> 00:31:55,824
And England will be lost!

521
00:31:55,825 --> 00:31:58,506
Yes, and if we're dead,
then that's MY England lost!

522
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:05,337
We go.

523
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:12,655
All right.

524
00:32:14,383 --> 00:32:16,989
But if we die,
don't come running to me.

525
00:32:17,377 --> 00:32:18,475
Go on, Will.

526
00:32:19,492 --> 00:32:20,683
John?

527
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:32,412
Ready?

528
00:32:36,713 --> 00:32:39,065
Djaq? Tell Marian we're in.

529
00:32:39,296 --> 00:32:41,368
Allan, John, keep watch.

530
00:32:44,085 --> 00:32:45,027
Much?

531
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,248
Do not take your eyes off
that hourglass. Bow.

532
00:33:03,585 --> 00:33:04,894
They're in.

533
00:33:04,987 --> 00:33:06,815
Better start losing.

534
00:33:09,071 --> 00:33:10,076
If that's the way he loses,

535
00:33:10,077 --> 00:33:13,256
you may have to use your contingency
plan sooner than expected.

536
00:33:13,545 --> 00:33:16,312
We're about even. It's early yet.

537
00:33:32,425 --> 00:33:33,707
Don't think about that.

538
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:34,736
Marian.

539
00:33:35,451 --> 00:33:37,172
We have to start losing.

540
00:33:37,173 --> 00:33:39,449
- I am doing my best.
- Time is running out.

541
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:42,445
Oh, brilliant.

542
00:33:47,262 --> 00:33:48,446
Go on!

543
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:57,717
Watch out!

544
00:34:02,672 --> 00:34:06,001
Sheriff,
let us make things interesting.

545
00:34:06,124 --> 00:34:07,788
Everything I have,

546
00:34:07,789 --> 00:34:11,554
against the entire contents
of your Strong Room.

547
00:34:14,212 --> 00:34:16,339
As we say in Bavaria,

548
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:20,306
"Das letzte Hemd hat keine Taschen."

549
00:34:23,702 --> 00:34:26,280
"You cannot take it with you."

550
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:31,315
Sheriff, what do you say?
It's only money.

551
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,032
I agree.

552
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:03,937
It's such a momentous game.
Might I suggest...

553
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:06,945
...a change of dice?

554
00:35:07,202 --> 00:35:08,774
As you wish.

555
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:16,572
Ja.

556
00:35:17,439 --> 00:35:18,387
I see.

557
00:35:23,184 --> 00:35:24,468
Ja...

558
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:27,740
You see?

559
00:35:28,433 --> 00:35:30,430
It's easy once you know how.

560
00:35:35,845 --> 00:35:37,321
Excellent!

561
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,620
For luck.

562
00:35:49,716 --> 00:35:50,826
The house wins!

563
00:35:56,908 --> 00:35:58,480
Hang on...

564
00:35:58,481 --> 00:35:59,417
what's this?

565
00:35:59,694 --> 00:36:01,629
Master, please get out,
there's no time!

566
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:03,195
Oh, Sheriff.

567
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,948
It's another trick.

568
00:36:07,023 --> 00:36:08,364
It's an illusion.

569
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:12,245
An image
thrown onto a sheet of glass.

570
00:36:18,925 --> 00:36:20,950
The money is not here.

571
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,752
Lady Marian,

572
00:36:24,469 --> 00:36:27,613
you have brought me
nothing but bad luck.

573
00:36:27,614 --> 00:36:29,830
Your attentions
are no longer welcome.

574
00:36:29,831 --> 00:36:31,183
Auf Weidersehen!

575
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:38,511
Well done, Marian.

576
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,251
It wasn't so hard, was it?

577
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:44,169
No... It wasn't.

578
00:36:47,215 --> 00:36:51,030
Excellent. The war chest
has doubled in one night.

579
00:36:52,884 --> 00:36:54,676
Master, get out of there.

580
00:37:15,984 --> 00:37:17,406
What are you doing?
Just leave it!

581
00:37:17,407 --> 00:37:19,210
We've come this far!

582
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:26,094
- Come on. What's he doing?!
- Wait!

583
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,935
The money is here.
The bags, quickly!

584
00:37:38,263 --> 00:37:40,703
Come on, Much. Give it...

585
00:37:40,704 --> 00:37:42,853
All right, all right!

586
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,737
Marian.

587
00:37:54,738 --> 00:37:57,119
My men have the coach ready.
Your friends?

588
00:37:57,153 --> 00:37:59,326
If they have succeeded,
we will know soon.

589
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:00,974
And if they haven't?

590
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,711
The hourglass!

591
00:38:11,954 --> 00:38:15,456
Why do we leave everything...

592
00:38:15,457 --> 00:38:18,495
to the last... second?!

593
00:38:18,530 --> 00:38:20,520
Well...

594
00:38:20,521 --> 00:38:22,295
I find it's more fun that way.

595
00:38:26,046 --> 00:38:27,191
No...

596
00:38:28,312 --> 00:38:29,480
Come on, go!

597
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:40,732
The Strong Room...

598
00:38:41,368 --> 00:38:43,210
Guards!

599
00:38:43,211 --> 00:38:44,916
Help! You men, quickly!

600
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:46,775
The Sheriff is under attack!

601
00:39:14,907 --> 00:39:16,571
Look at YOU!

602
00:39:17,924 --> 00:39:18,848
You must be careful.

603
00:39:18,849 --> 00:39:21,437
If I can see the friendship
between you, so may others.

604
00:39:21,438 --> 00:39:23,333
Don't worry,
I crave the danger.

605
00:39:23,334 --> 00:39:25,067
If you're ever in Bavaria,

606
00:39:25,068 --> 00:39:28,051
I remain, my lady,
your servant, your booby...

607
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:29,137
and your friend.

608
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,109
You're funny.

609
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,254
- You are beautiful.
- You're leaving.

610
00:39:49,344 --> 00:39:51,806
My war chest,
and the booby's money...

611
00:39:53,162 --> 00:39:57,081
But they can't have done! No! No!

612
00:39:57,948 --> 00:40:00,465
No! No!

613
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,164
No! No!

614
00:40:04,065 --> 00:40:05,812
No!

615
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,545
Count Friedrich will take
you as far as the coast.

616
00:40:19,546 --> 00:40:21,869
I can't thank you enough
for your help, Stephen.

617
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:23,689
Yes, you can.

618
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,861
The families of the
men that died.

619
00:40:25,862 --> 00:40:27,204
We'll look after them.

620
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,057
You will prevail.

621
00:40:38,224 --> 00:40:40,271
Now, you're sure about your route?

622
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:42,271
You stick to the smaller roads.

623
00:40:42,272 --> 00:40:43,971
The Sheriff will have
the main ones covered.

624
00:40:43,972 --> 00:40:46,804
Another bumpy ride.
This country...

625
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:50,012
By the time I get home,
I will be perfectly scrambled.

626
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:52,190
This is your money.

627
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:54,955
And thank you.
England is forever in your debt.

628
00:40:55,485 --> 00:40:57,596
Take it. Keep it.

629
00:40:57,631 --> 00:40:58,562
What?

630
00:40:58,574 --> 00:41:02,250
England's debt is to Lady Marian.
Not me.

631
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:04,354
Spend it wisely, Robin Hood.

632
00:41:05,788 --> 00:41:07,649
About Marian...

633
00:41:07,996 --> 00:41:10,710
One gamble I would have
given anything to win.

634
00:41:10,976 --> 00:41:12,906
You are a lucky man, Robin Hood.

635
00:41:18,462 --> 00:41:19,353
Farewell.

636
00:41:26,069 --> 00:41:27,133
Right...

637
00:41:28,112 --> 00:41:29,283
Work to do.

638
00:41:36,058 --> 00:41:37,584
I'm not being funny but...

639
00:41:37,585 --> 00:41:39,075
the poor have it easy.

640
00:41:39,076 --> 00:41:41,796
I don't think so, Allan.

641
00:41:44,422 --> 00:41:46,064
This is what we do, lads.

642
00:41:46,065 --> 00:41:49,551
We've turned war chest
into poor chest.

643
00:41:50,984 --> 00:41:54,787
Well, come on. We have four
more villages before sun down.

644
00:41:58,639 --> 00:41:59,992
I've been thinking.

645
00:42:00,408 --> 00:42:02,165
We've never been to Germany.

646
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:05,102
If things don't work out here, then...

647
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:07,582
maybe the count would
have us over there.

648
00:42:07,583 --> 00:42:10,832
Much, Count of Schleswig-Holstein!

649
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:12,930
What's so funny?

650
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:16,700
I could be Count of Schleshy...
whatever.

651
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:18,854
It's hard to be count of a place
you can't pronounce!

652
00:42:18,855 --> 00:42:20,276
No, not necessarily.

653
00:42:20,277 --> 00:42:23,004
Nah. Sovereign of Sherwood, mate.
That's you.

654
00:42:23,825 --> 00:42:26,873
Well, that's us, lads.
Sovereigns of Sherwood.

655
00:42:28,411 --> 00:42:29,104
NEXT TIME

656
00:42:29,105 --> 00:42:30,480
- It's Gisborne.
- <i>Now!</i>

657
00:42:30,481 --> 00:42:32,526
He's creating a new armour.

658
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:34,330
- We need to take his toys away.
- Get them!

659
00:42:34,331 --> 00:42:37,007
I want 5000 suits of armour.

660
00:42:37,008 --> 00:42:38,961
I'm afraid I can't let you keep
these diamonds, Gisborne.

661
00:42:38,962 --> 00:42:40,222
And I can't let you take them.

662
00:42:41,748 --> 00:42:44,567
When there are people
who know our little secret,

663
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:45,700
those people have to die.

664
00:42:47,030 --> 00:42:48,880
I need your permission
to leave the castle.

665
00:42:48,881 --> 00:42:49,878
Hit him!

666
00:42:49,879 --> 00:42:52,132
A man wearing this
would be invincible.
