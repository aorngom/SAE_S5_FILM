1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,300
previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,380
the surgical training protocol  is officially changing,people.

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,890
you thought that you'd defend youriboyfend to me,and I'd just take it?

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,520
He's not my boyfriend.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,760
- Hi. - Hi.

6
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,010
You and derek will not work.

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,040
Why do you care what I think?

8
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:19,000
If I'm gonna do this with him,I need you to cheer me on.

9
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,630
as surgeons,we are trained to fix what's broken.

10
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:27,680
I'm in a hurry.

11
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:28,600
I can't stay.

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,350
The chief's having a big meeting.

13
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,220
Uh,but I wanted to tell you  that I'm finished with therapy.

14
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,560
The breaking point is our starting line...at work.

15
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,530
Meredith,you are not finished.

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,230
You have worked incredibly hard.

17
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,160
Look how far you've come.But you're just scratching the surface.

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,600
Well,derek's moved in,and we've taken it to the next level.

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,010
It's not about derek.

20
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,210
I'm happy.

21
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:53,060
You're not done.

22
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:54,290
I am happy.

23
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,930
- Isn't that the point? - No.

24
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:59,310
But in our lives,the breang point is a sign of weakness...

25
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,350
I need you to stayfor the session.

26
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,720
I-I--no.The meeting,the chief,I...

27
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,910
thank you,dr.Wyatt.

28
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,680
Thanks for everything.

29
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,990
And we'll do everything we can to avoid it.

30
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,600
- Whoa. - Oh,sorry.

31
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:17,920
What are you doing in here?

32
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,030
I'm thinking about making this my office when you move T.

33
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:21,220
When I move out?

34
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:22,530
When am I moving out?

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,600
Oh...soon?

36
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:31,330
Did you know meredith was planning on making us move out?

37
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,170
I'm kinda busy here,iz.

38
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,740
You can join us if you want.

39
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:34,650
No!

40
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:38,180
When were you planning on telling us we had to move out?

41
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,380
When were you planning on telling them they had to move out?

42
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,020
What?Why do they have to move out?

43
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,840
Meredith,hey,look,I made this especially for you.

44
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:46,220
It's a zoo,a frat house,with alex and his parade of women...

45
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,400
his parade of skanks.

46
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,350
Whatever.Am i apartment hunting or what?

47
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,770
I don't know.I have to think about it.

48
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,260
Well,just,you kn,eat the muffin,mer.

49
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,470
Taste the muffin.

50
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,590
Remember the muffin.

51
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,360
I like my roommates.

52
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,520
I like them,too.

53
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:00,750
That was your life.

54
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,250
This is our life.

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,970
And I'm excited about building our life together.

56
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:06,730
Come on.It's gonna be great.

57
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:19,080
so derek wants alex and izzie to move out.

58
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,790
Well,since when does he say "jump" and you jump?

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,610
Well,I'm happy.

60
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,030
I'd be pissed off...

61
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,510
but,you know,whatever you want.

62
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,930
hey,you hear anything about what the new rules are?

63
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:40,820
last I heard,you were at hand holding,foot rubs and lots of late-night gab sessions.

64
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,060
Excuse me?

65
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,090
listen up,everyone.

66
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,380
Oh!No,you were talking about the,uh,chief's new rules.

67
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:48,260
I thought you were referring to you and torres.

68
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,040
I've been wrong before.

69
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,390
We're busy people,so I'm gonna try and be brief.

70
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:59,970
I am implementing a new teaching protocol here at seattle grace.

71
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:06,390
Now some of these rules are new,and some are old and are going to be newly enforced.

72
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,110
jack o'brien,47,scheduled for an abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.

73
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:13,430
His,uh,last C.TShowed calcification,

74
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:18,060
so I ordered a C.T.Angio to determine whether it had worsened or remained stable.

75
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,620
Nice catch,yang.You can take him down after rounds.

76
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,030
Dr.Karev will take over.

77
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,530
Dr.Yang,you're done here.Thank you.

78
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,470
First-,second- and third-year residents will no longer be allowed to de facto specialize.

79
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,760
The practice interferes with theevelopment of a fully rounded surgical education.

80
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:38,080
-No more.
-barry patmore,63...

81
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,910
has been experiencing chronic headaches for the past seven years,

82
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,620
has been treated with narcotics,antiseizure medications,antidepressants

83
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,040
and antipsychotic medications with no success.

84
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,340
how severe is the pain today,mr.Patmore,scale of one to ten?

85
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,550
Eight.

86
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,850
It's always an eight.

87
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,940
Which is why mr.Patmore's last consult suggested a bilateral cingulotomy

88
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,990
-- I'm sorry,a frontal lobotomy for a headache?

89
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,110
too loud.

90
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,280
Please.

91
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,220
And could you do something about the buzzing?

92
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,600
Do we need all these machines?

93
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:17,290
mr.Patmore has been experiencing intense pain all day,every day for seven years.

94
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,670
But the cingulotomy could cause seizures or cognitive defects or behavioral changes.

95
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:28,260
Which is why we are going to explore every other possible option  before resorting to such a radical surgery.

96
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,520
More tests.

97
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,930
Yes.

98
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,840
Dr.Yang,you'll be assisting dr.Shepherd today.

99
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:43,610
personal relationships personal loyalties and personal favorites  will no longer be a factor in our training program.

100
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:49,510
Attendings,you will spread your wealth of knowledge  equally among all of the residents.

101
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:54,200
In addition,we will refocus our attention on patient communication and bedside manner.

102
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,070
For some of us,this means learning the lost art of humanity and compassion.

103
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:06,730
For others,this means learning how to treat patient  without becoming emotionally involved with them.

104
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,390
Shelley boden,30,stage iv colon cancer with liver mets.

105
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,100
Shelley has been through extensive chemo and radiation,

106
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,070
and according to the C.T.,A liver resection at this point could be curative.

107
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,240
Will be curative.Will.

108
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,590
Do you have any other questions for us?

109
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,200
What happens if you find more cancer than you expect?

110
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:25,540
No,jenn.

111
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:31,160
"A," that's not gonna happen,and "b," izzie's already answered  all of your questions three times.

112
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,300
Well,izzie's not the main surgeon.

113
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,590
Izzie's awesome.

114
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:35,800
We love izzie.

115
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:36,710
This is dr.Grey.

116
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:39,920
She's gonna prep you for surgery and answer any more questions you have.

117
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,270
izzie's not staying?

118
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,500
This is a surgical program.

119
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,450
Psychiatry is on the fifth floor.

120
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
Let's not confuse the two.

121
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:54,180
In addition,residents,your interns reflect on you.

122
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,580
If they fail,you fail.

123
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,760
If they succeed,you succeed.

124
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:03,330
Attendings,that goes for residents as well.

125
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,110
Teach with enthusiasm.

126
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,600
Learn with enthusiasm.

127
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,410
We are surgeons.

128
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:14,380
We cut out malignancies.

129
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,740
Let's start at home,people.

130
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,140
o'malley.This is dr.Bennett epstein.

131
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,090
He'll be your proctor for the exam today.

132
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,160
You about ready,o'malley?

133
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,250
Oh,yes,sir.

134
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,300
You have exactly three hours from the moment you open the test.

135
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,110
Once you break the seal,you may not leave the room  until you have completed the entire exam.

136
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,680
Good luck,o'malley.

137
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,870
Thank you,sir.

138
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,930
I can do this.

139
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:53,860
I am not married and cheating on my wife with my best friend.

140
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:58,280
everything's just as it should be.

141
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,510
damn chair.

142
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,850
Hang on.

143
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,020
Looks like the wheel's broken.

144
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,100
That's how things work around me.

145
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:25,600
My toaster broke last month,then my cat ran away and my back porch collapsed.

146
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:28,120
Also,my tv only shows the color green.

147
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,560
I'll get another chair.

148
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,630
Don't bother.I'll walk.Probably safer.

149
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,460
No,mr.O'brien,you need to stay in the chair.

150
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,710
Uh,it's hospital policy.

151
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,930
- Mr.O'brien! - I've also had three car wrecks in the last year.

152
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,310
mr.O'brien.

153
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,730
Somebody get me a gurney over here.

154
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920

157
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,960
Sir,im very sorry.

158
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,780
I hit my head.

159
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,910
I'm very,very sorry.

160
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:00,600
Okay,get him a C.T.And I want hourly updates on his condition.

161
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,490
Yes,sir.

162
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,590
You're gonna be okay.

163
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,440
mike,my ceiling's raining here.

164
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,900
It looks like a pipe burst.

165
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,310
We gotta turn off the water and isolate it.

166
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:14,950
No,no,this is the surgical floor.

167
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:18,340
Water's required to scrub in,to clean equipment,to keep people alive.

168
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,820
I need you to fix this with the water on.

169
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,600
I can try.

170
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,750
All right,keep me posted.

171
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,330
um,chief...

172
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,830
there is some kind of leak in the conference room.

173
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,330
You don't say.

174
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:49,270
I was wondering if there was some--anywhere else that I could take the exam.

175
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,540
I will find a different room on my own.

176
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,560
Thank you,sir.

177
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,710
We have a problem.

178
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,590
Mark sloan has found us out.

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,030
mark's known from the beginning.I told him.

180
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,000
He's mark sloan.

181
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,580
Well,you don't have a person that you talk to about things?

182
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:18,060
You are the person that i talk to about things.

183
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,560
And I like to keep my private life private--

184
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:26,120
from everyone-- but most definitely from mark...sloan.

185
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,230
How long will the operation be?

186
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,970
At least a couple of hours.

187
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,030
You think it could be longer?

188
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,040
Well,if there are complications or if the mets are more extensive

189
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,060
-- they won't be.Jenn--

190
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,790
- but what if  - jenn,please stop.

191
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:48,210
Just call mom and dad,tell them two hours.

192
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,880
Since I got cancer,my sister's only capable of talking about cancer,which is so much worse than the cancer.

193
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,860
So I know I don't know you,but spill.

194
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,860
Spill what?

195
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:12,670
Anything,I'm begging you,before she comes back  and asks you to describe my liver cell by cell.

196
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,280
Please.

197
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,500
Okay.

198
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:17,940
Um...

199
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,560
do you want to hear about my stupid boss or my stupid boyfriend?

200
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,000
Oh,boyfriend.

201
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,440
Definitely t boyfriend.

202
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,050
Okay,mr.Patmore.

203
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,460
I'm gonna give you a variety of different stimuli  so we can take a look at the wave patterns generated.

204
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:35,100
I need you to remove your hand from your eyes now.

205
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,930
okay,are we still at an eight?

206
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,070
It's still at eight.

207
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,460
Okay.

208
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,090
Starting visual stimuli.

209
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,140
if you were me,you'd want 'em out...

210
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,990
the roommates.

211
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,170
I'm not being unreasonable,right?

212
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,330
His pulse is coming down.

213
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,710
But u have to admit,you'd want them out.

214
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,510
if you were me,you would want them out.

215
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,230
if we have to operate,I'll let you drill burr holes by yourself.

216
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,190
fine,I'd want them out.Whatever.

217
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,090
Knew it.

218
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:22,480
Okay,mr.Patmore.

219
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:26,420
Okay,we're gonna change your position now,okay?

220
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,590
um,dr.Yang,I think I have an idea.

221
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:33,440
Well,don't think,know and run to the lab for his test results.

222
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,630
But izzie bakes and alex fixes things.

223
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,590
Okay,when I am no longer cancer girl and I can go out and meet a hot doctor

224
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,120
who rocks my world and wants to move in with me,

225
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,550
I might forgo the baked goods and repair work.

226
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:53,040
ooh,heads-up,12:00.

227
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,680
Just so you know,cristina thinks you should move them out you should talk to her.

228
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,650
Dude...you failed to mention the hair.

229
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,800
Yeah,yeah,the hair.

230
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,830
It's one of the many things that makes me happy.

231
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,470
Dr.Sloan,um,I'm working with shepherd today on a pain patient,

232
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,860
and I read this article while i was helping george study...

233
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:15,990
pathetic.

234
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,490
Yes.

235
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:22,850
I know,I'm pathetic but I did read this article and I do have a photographic memory,

236
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,870
and the chief's on his new thing where he wants the interns to be heard and not just seen--

237
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,120
use fewer words,grey.

238
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:29,350
I think he needs an E.N.T.

239
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,710
You're an E.N.T.,Right?

240
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,930
How you doing in there,mr.O'brien?

241
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:37,950
Could be worse.

242
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,810
Could have brain leaking from my ea .

243
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:41,860
That's the spirit.

244
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:44,110
It'll only take a couple more minutes.Hang on.

245
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:51,250
Guess what I found-- an apartment,a beautiful apartment with hardwood floors

246
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:54,870
and an honest-to-god fireplace that you can build honest-to-god fires in,

247
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:58,530
and I can't afford it by myself.

248
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,290
So...

249
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,770
I thought if you could get over yourself,we could live together.

250
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,570
No,thanks.

251
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,350
Did I mention the hardwood floors and the nest-to-god fireplace?

252
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,100
I'd rather live in my honest-to-god R.

253
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,220
Right.

254
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,840
How's he doing,karev?

255
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,400
You think we're looking at a lawsuit?

256
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,350
Well,we don't ha e picture yet,but,uh,no.

257
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,650
This guy doesn't seem like the lawsuit type.

258
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,740
Well,let's hope you're right.

259
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,080
hello?

260
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,890
hello?

261
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,500
I cannot apologize enough.

262
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,110
You treat him like a king.

263
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,400
You hear that,mr.O'brien?

264
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,620
Dr.Karev is gonna take great care of you.

265
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,860
You're our number one priority today.

266
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,600
You okay?

267
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,490
God ha s me.

268
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:14,490
-Mr.O'brien,I am--  -my wife left me.

269
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,710
My accountant stole from me.

270
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,660
the store I worked at burned down.

271
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:25,080
I was diagnosed with an aneurysm for which I require surgery in a hospital

272
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,250
that seems to be...

273
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,520
crumbling around me.

274
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,720
God hates me.

275
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,070
You can see the remaining tumor is easily identified here.

276
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,220
Her liver looks so healthy.

277
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,820
That's the beauty of general surgery.

278
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,340
You see badness surrounded by goodness--

279
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,580
cut out the badness,all is right with the world.

280
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:53,710
It's just you and your scalpel,one-on-one,mano a mano.

281
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:58,390
Y-- okay,this is me teaching with enthusiasm.

282
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:06,340
Oh,no.

283
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,240
-O'malley. -What?

284
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:22,430
if you're finished with your test,

285
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,850
um,look,the hospital's flooding,the C.T.Is on the fritz,

286
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,630
my post-op and pre-op patients are backed up for days.

287
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,420
I gotta get a handle on this thing before the patients find out

288
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,200
and our ranking drops way past 12.

289
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,050
I found a nice,quiet room in psych for you to take your exam.

290
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,880
Oh,I-I-I see.

291
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,240
Um,yeah,you--you-- you go ahead.

292
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,100
Chief.

293
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,590
I am your intern at least for one more day.

294
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:56,850
I can help.

295
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,680
dr.Shepherd,a word.

296
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,190
Excuse me one second.

297
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:06,030
Uh,do you,uh,mind if I run a quick test on your patient?

298
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,110
He's in a lot of pain,mark.

299
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:08,450
I don't think he needs a tummy tuck.

300
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:09,620
Oh,that's funny.

301
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:12,390
No,uh,dr.Grey came to me with an interesting idea,

302
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:17,570
and,uh,unlike you,I'm taking the chief's new teaching protocol seriously,so I listened.

303
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:21,360
Uh,I-I read a thing about swelling and compression of the ethmoid nerve.

304
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:24,120
I believe if we were to stick a cottle elevator up his nose--

305
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:24,860
no,I'm--I'm sorry.

306
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,180
Up his nose?

307
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:30,580
If dr.Grey is on the right track,the,uh,patient will let us know.

308
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,730
Okay.

309
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,130
Mr.Patmore,I'm dr.Sloan.

310
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:37,910
I'm the head of plastic surgery and an ear,nose and throat specialist.

311
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:40,040
I'd like to run a quick test if I can have your permission.

312
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,550
I've seen 16 E.N.T.S not one could help me.

313
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,460
Now breathe normally.

314
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,510
I'm gonna angle this into here.

315
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,540
you let me know when you feel any...

316
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,460
pain or anything.

317
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,720
That's it!

318
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,370
That's the pain!

319
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,550
That's what's causing the pain.

320
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,810
oh,my god.

321
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,380
Oh,my god.

322
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,730
okay.

323
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,500
Anterior ethmoid neurovascular complex.

324
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,580
A simple middle turbinectomy will fix it.

325
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,660
Unless you still want to chop out the front of his brain.

326
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:23,630
nicely done.

327
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,540
hi.

328
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,680
How'd it go?

329
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,120
hi,shelley,um...

330
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:46,440
we found that the mets were much more extensive than the C.T.Detected,

331
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,600
and the main tumor actually extended in

332
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,500
and around the major blood vessel behind the liver.

333
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,070
We're just gonna start a new round of chemo.

334
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,130
That's all.

335
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:59,070
I already have a call in to your oncologist.

336
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,300
That's him.

337
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,670
I'll--I'll be right back.

338
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:09,840
we can manage your pain.

339
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,520
I'm sorry we don't have better news.

340
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,440
So did you...

341
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,960
decide what to do about your roommates?

342
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:40,360
I'm so sorry,shelley.

343
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,800
Come on.

344
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,770
So how good is the hot boyfriend in bed?

345
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,000
look...

346
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,170
we don't even know what we are yet.

347
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:07,710
So how does mark sloan know?

348
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:10,240
Why are you talking to him...

349
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,190
instead of me?

350
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,310
Ladies.

351
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,620
Am I interrupting?

352
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,300
You're timing is perfect.

353
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,570
Really?

354
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,950
Are you about to feel her up?

355
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,340
stop.You have to stop.

356
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,080
I can'T.

357
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,280
Seriously,she hates it.

358
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,840
That's why I can'T.

359
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,460
Don't--you want a spanking?

360
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:37,020
-I--  - okay?

361
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:42,280
So you told derek you think I shouldick them out?

362
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,510
No.

363
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:45,050
No,I s--

364
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,610
I told him I would want them out--me,not you--

365
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,780
and I only said it 'cause hewouldn't stop talking.

366
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,270
So you don't think I should kick them out?

367
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,170
'Cause I think I'm going to.

368
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,440
I mean,I think it's the adult thing to do,don't you?

369
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,770
What does yourhrink say?

370
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:57,700
I quit my shrink.

371
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:59,600
I'm happy.We're happy.

372
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,770
Hey,can I sit here?

373
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,340
George,hey!

374
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,960
George,uh,how--how did it go?

375
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,440
I just-- there was a water problem.

376
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,170
I mean,I'm just trying to help the chief

377
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:14,470
even though all the mecal facts are falling out of my ear onto the floor.

378
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,930
Eat this.It's brain food.

379
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,990
My dude with the aneurysm?

380
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:21,630
Fell in the water,smacked his head and got stuck in the C.T.Machine.

381
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:22,600
My patient's dying.

382
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,110
I hate it when I like them and they're dying.

383
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,790
our guy's been living in pain--

384
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,880
pain at a constant eight for the last seven years--

385
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,930
because of an inflamed nerve in his nose.That's crazy.

386
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,000
I wish I had an inflamed nerve in my nose.

387
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,710
There is no way that that guy has been living at an eight.

388
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,550
He a wimp.

389
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,690
His eight,my three.I can take pain.

390
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,680
You can't talk to my boyfriend for ten minutes.

391
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,260
Well,there's pain and then there's torture.

392
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,140
And I can take pain.Seriously,test me.

393
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,340
nothing.

394
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,060
That's impressive.

395
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,580
Shut up.

396
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:52,520
You barely touched her.

397
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:55,770
-No,no. -No!

398
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,590
Knock it off!

399
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,610
Stop it!

400
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:01,370
Um,how did you diagnose that nerve,because I've never even heard of that condition before?

401
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:04,830
I remembered an article from the "british journal of E.N.T.

402
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,750
," And it was issue number 47,page 19 from 1964.

403
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,030
Photographic memory.

404
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,590
Dude,lex-opedia.

405
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:14,470
Oh,I hate you.

406
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,720
Don't hate me.I can help you.

407
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,030
Oh,uh,chief.

408
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,760
What's going on with the flood?

409
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,350
It's not a flood,bailey.

410
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,720
It's a pipe that...

411
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,170
it's minor,okay.

412
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,520
Not to worry.

413
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,080
Aren't you headed to surgery?

414
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,550
Yes,sir.

415
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:38,490
Uh,chief,a few months ago,little tuck flushed one of his action figures down the toilet,

416
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:41,320
and I thought it was no big deal,minor.

417
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:47,060
Buthen I came home to a kitchen filled with several inches of poop water.

418
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,450
Poop water?

419
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:50,840
In my kitchen,sir.

420
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,980
Thank you,dr.Bailey,but I have this under control.

421
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,600
Yes,sir.

422
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,090
Poop water.

423
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,570
Hey

424
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,510
so apparently there's some kind of leak,

425
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,920
and the chief wants me to move all the pre-op patients to the clinic.

426
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,720
So who's free to help me?

427
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,410
not a high pain threshold,huh?

428
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,880
You know what?Throw him out.

429
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
Not me,just him.

430
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,410
She likes me more.

431
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:19,500
I bake for everyone and I clean.

432
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,340
The only thing you bring to the house is filth.

433
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:24,130
What would you prefer,meredith,chocolate cake or an S.T.D.?

434
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,380
water!

435
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,740
Oh,god.It's everywhere.

436
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,640
-What's happening?What happened? -come on.

437
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:34,110
-Let's keep moving.Move! -somebody get the chief.

438
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:37,450
Post-ops to rooms 2415.

439
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,350
Pre-ops to rooms 2233,4 and 5.

440
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,300
The overflow goes into the clinic.

441
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,970
Chief.

442
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:46,060
I-I got everything under control up here,

443
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,870
but I need you to oversee stevens with the pre-ops in the clinic.

444
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,430
Okay,sir,maybe we need to shut down,

445
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:55,810
just send the patients to mercy west,seattle pres.

446
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:58,790
They can repair the pipe,and we'll be up and running in no time.

447
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,970
I am sending all our patients to dry ground.

448
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,750
I closed all but two O.R.S.Maintenance has isolated the broken pipe.

449
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,300
So thank you,dr.Bailey,

450
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,970
but when I say that I've got it under control,

451
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,030
that's what I mean.

452
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,690
But,sir,they may have isolated it,

453
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,840
but a lot of water got out before they did.

454
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,470
I'm just saying that maybe--

455
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,860
dr.Bailey,clinic,now!

456
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,690
Yes,sir.

457
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,550
On my way.

458
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:26,030
Hey,hey,slow down.

459
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,190
Okay,what next?

460
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,770
Wait.Are you sure you have time for this?

461
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:36,540
I really want you to get to take your test.

462
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,260
Thank you.

463
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,830
grey.

464
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,460
Uh,despite your,uh,unfortunate taste in men,

465
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,380
it turns out you're not entirely useless.

466
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:48,430
Mr.Patmore's condition is extremely rare,

467
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,950
anyou nailed it.

468
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,780
You can scrub in.

469
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,000
Now?

470
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,210
You're doing the surgery now,with the--with the flood?

471
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:58,880
The flood's contained,and our man's been in pain for seven years.

472
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,890
See you in surgery.

473
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,140
I can'T.

474
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:05,140
I'm sorry,um,but I'm busy--

475
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:08,810
I'm really busy helping the chief with the-- chief's,um,iern.

476
00:24:08,810 --> 00:24:11,260
I-I--thank you,but maybe next time?

477
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,550
No,lassie.

478
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,950
There won't be a next time.

479
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,440
Pathetic.

480
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,760
Mr.Patmore,I'm just gonna draw somdbloo and,

481
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,380
uh,place a topical decongestant before I take you to surgery.

482
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,060
Absolutely.Of course.

483
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:28,020
How's your pain level now?

484
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,100
Eight.

485
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,190
It's always at eight.

486
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:33,490
Oh.

487
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:35,740
Well,it looked like you had some relief.

488
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,410
I've spent seven years...

489
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,500
I've seen 39 doctors...

490
00:24:43,330 --> 00:24:46,710
And I've tried every kind of painkiller,and nothinhelps.

491
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,000
I've had doctors tell me it's my imagination...

492
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,340
that I'm crazy...

493
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,820
call me a drug addict.

494
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,520
My wife died last year.

495
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,850
After spending years carting me around to doctor after doctor,

496
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:13,730
test after test,she died.

497
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,240
She was my best friend.

498
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:23,010
she was my favorite person.

499
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,810
And she died...

500
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:30,040
and I couldn't feel it.

501
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:38,260
I couldn't feel that pain because I was so completely occupied witthis one.

502
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,590
and now I finally know what's wrong,

503
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,370
and dr.Sloan's gonna fix it.

504
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,630
So you're right.

505
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,950
you're right that I'm feeling some relief.

506
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,050
okay,let's get your blood drawn.

507
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,240
I'm not gonna do it.I'm not gonna have surgery.

508
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,080
It's just gonna hurt.

509
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,510
She's gonna slice me in half and probably kill me.

510
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:10,650
If she doesn't kill me,it'll just hurt like hell.

511
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,340
Probably get infected and hurt worse.

512
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,140
I'm not gonna do it.

513
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,210
Look,I get that you're scared,

514
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,160
but if you want to live,you need the surgery.

515
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,160
If I want to live?

516
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,270
Have you been paying any attention?

517
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,830
My girlfriend had a hysterical pregnancy,went nuts,

518
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:33,740
cut her wrists while I was in the next room and had to be committed.

519
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:35,890
And now my roommate's planning to make me move out.

520
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:37,990
I have no money for a deposit anywhere else,

521
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:40,820
so chances are,next week,I'm homeless.

522
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:45,670
You making stuff up to make me feel better?

523
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,520
Look,you must have something to live for.

524
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,130
Or even just the possibility of something.

525
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,820
There's a girl at the grocery store.

526
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,150
I keep meaning to say hello.

527
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,140
Instead I...

528
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:05,750
just keep asking her about the produce.

529
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:06,520
All right.

530
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,140
So you get the surgery.

531
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:11,670
'Cause chances are your-- your luck's gonna turn around.

532
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,510
It's science.

533
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:15,210
It's--it's-- it's the law of averages.

534
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:17,400
It's gonna turn around.

535
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,670
And when it does...

536
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,770
you say hello.

537
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,120
I say hello.

538
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:42,370
chips?

539
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,090
Chocolate?

540
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,860
Thanks.

541
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,490
What?

542
00:27:56,490 --> 00:27:58,680
You're not a terrible person.

543
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,730
Okay.

544
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,330
I know we don't always see eye to eye,but...

545
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,940
I found this really great apartment.

546
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,770
It's right across the street from the hospital.

547
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:10,210
It has really great light.

548
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,770
I know you can afford it,and it's burke-free.

549
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:17,140
It must be kind of awful living in his old place.

550
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:19,890
Think about it.

551
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:34,960
you can open that retractor up a little more if you want to get a betterooK.

552
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,660
Just make sure you keep the small bowel inside.

553
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:40,110
We want to avoid a post-op ileus.

554
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,440
Well,we better.

555
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,740
The dude thinks there's a dark cloud following him around.

556
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,930
Well,that sounds overly dramatic.

557
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,720
what's that?

558
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,110
What's-- what the hell?

559
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,450
Hey,mo-move-- move the patient.

560
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,510
What?

561
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:04,380
Move the patient!

562
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,080
Oh,my god!

563
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:17,790
Is everyone okay?How's our patient?

564
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:19,330
He's stable.Vitals holding steady.

565
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,530
All right.Irrigation,please.

566
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:21,550
How can I help?

567
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:23,950
Uh,find the chief and tell him what happened.

568
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,090
God,we need a new O.R.

569
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:27,370
They shut down all the other O.R.S except for this one and dr.Sloan'S.

570
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:29,090
Okay,uh,karev,go to sloan.

571
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:30,880
He just got started.Maybe he can close.

572
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,620
All right.I need everybody's help.

573
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,310
We're gonna get ready to move mr.O'brien.

574
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,350
What do I tell sloan?

575
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,400
Just tell him the damn sky is falling.

576
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,990
nasal speculum and lidocaine.

577
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,110
larger speculum.Another lidocaine.

578
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,380
We're just watching?

579
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,860
I'm a pain specialist,and I would've missed this thing.

580
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,220
So,yes,we're just gonna watch.

581
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,790
don't ever use me again to try and influence her.

582
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,680
You and i are not team meredith.

583
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:03,130
We need the O.R.

584
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,410
We need the O.R.!

585
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,360
On a patient?

586
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:10,210
Yes,sir.

587
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,790
Collapsed?

588
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:17,000
Your staff wasn't hurt,but the patient's abdomen was open.

589
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,140
He's stable as far as I know.

590
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,090
dr.Bailey,spread the word.

591
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,540
We are closing the surgical floor and shipping our patients out to mercy west and seattle presbyterian.

592
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,050
Yes,sir.

593
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,760
And,dr.Bailey...

594
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,200
try not to gloat on the way out.

595
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,030
No gloating,sir.

596
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:53,830
Anybody see any more damage,any bleeding?

597
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,230
no,no bleeding.I just cleared the lower left quadrant.

598
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,030
Give me the pulse irrigator.

599
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,740
dr.Hahn,take a look at this right here.

600
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,650
The pancreas--is that,uh,damage from the debris?

601
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,690
No,no.

602
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,570
That's a tumor.

603
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,770
Oh,son of a bitch.

604
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,740
-you're the shrink,right? -Yeah.

605
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,400
Well,you can't let her quit.

606
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:20,260
Let me guess.

607
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,580
Cristina?

608
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:24,200
She talks ab-- whatever.

609
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:28,440
Um,you can't let her quit because I'm no longer allowed an opinion

610
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,330
because I'm being supportive.So...

611
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,280
you're my last hope.

612
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,530
I mean,it's your job to have an opinion,right?

613
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:38,690
You're paid to have an opinion?

614
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,240
That's right.

615
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,930
Okay,so,um...

616
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,590
she lives her life at an eight.

617
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,430
Her pain...

618
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:50,790
on any given day,she lives at an eight.

619
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,410
And he doesn't get that.

620
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,830
I mean,he moves in and expects her to-- to move her roommates out?

621
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:59,620
Which goes to show you how completely he doesn't get her,because she needs them.

622
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,880
So you need to tell her not to move them out.

623
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,030
I mean,it's not gonna work out in the long run anyway,

624
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,390
and she thinks that she's happy,but she's not.

625
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,160
And it's your job to tell her.

626
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:15,730
It must be incredibly painful for you--

627
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:18,920
the idea of losing meredith to derek.

628
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,860
You're a terrible shrink.

629
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,420
-just talk to the oncologist. -No.

630
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:32,250
There's a clinical trial using chemo plus avastin.

631
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:33,660
And there's-- you're not a doctor.

632
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:36,270
Please stop talking like you're a doctor.

633
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:47,660
Did you have me paged?

634
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,930
Yes,because...

635
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,520
I'm dying,and you can't let me die without knowing what you decided.

636
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,910
You look very serious.

637
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,640
Oh,my god.

638
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,760
Are you gonna break up with him?

639
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,590
No fair.

640
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:18,320
I'm dying,and you're casting all that hotness in the wind.

641
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,600
No fair.

642
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,190
No fair.

643
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:30,190
No fair.

644
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:32,760
It's no fair.

645
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,220
It's no fair.

646
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,310
No fair,no fair,no fair.

647
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,780
Dr.Hahn's gonna come in and talk to you in a couple of minutes.

648
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,220
How'd it go?

649
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,820
Okay?

650
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,310
Actually,not so okay.

651
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,290
Uh,the flood weakened the ceiling in the O.R.

652
00:34:11,390 --> 00:34:14,940
The ceiling collapsed in several fragments,landed inside your incision.

653
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,180
Because of the ceiling thing,we had to explore your

654
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:21,420
abdomen more thoroughly than we normally would have,and...

655
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,730
as a result,we found a malignant tumor on your pancreas.

656
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:26,540
Cancer?

657
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,010
You found cancer?

658
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:32,940
well,wait,wait.

659
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:35,380
Listen,listen to me,'cause here's the thing--

660
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,620
we took it out,we sent it to pathology.

661
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,290
It was only stage I.

662
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:40,680
Only stage I.

663
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,340
We never find pancreatic tumors so early.

664
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,110
They're almost always a death sentence by the time they're diagnosed.

665
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,830
but not for you.

666
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,650
we took the tumor,the whole thing.

667
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,240
We took it out.

668
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,850
You won't even need chemo.

669
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:56,550
That ceiling collapse,it...

670
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,780
it saved your life.

671
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:00,740
Your luck has turned,man.

672
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,520
It's turned.

673
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:09,360
I'm gonna say heO...

674
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,140
to that girl.

675
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,380
I'm gonna say hello.

676
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,200
chief.

677
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:24,540
Chief?

678
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:28,320
Ch-chief,I've downloaded all our patients labs and radiology onto dvds,

679
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,900
and I've attached them to each of their charts.

680
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,110
Is there anything else I can do to help?

681
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,940
How'd it go?

682
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,690
I-I know.

683
00:35:45,870 --> 00:35:47,100
I'm pathetic.

684
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,870
And george doesn't know I exist.

685
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:51,010
And I missed my surgery and blah,blah,blah.

686
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,260
Could you please just tell me how it went with mr.Patmore?

687
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,300
We didn't get to do the surgery.

688
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:58,360
Mr.Patmore has been shipped off to another hospital,

689
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:02,000
and he will be out of pain by this time tomorrow.

690
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,560
Photographic memory,huh?

691
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,280
Yeah.

692
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:10,310
Periodic table.Go.

693
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:11,970
Hydrogen,helium,lithium,beryllium,

694
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,870
boron,carbon,nitrogen,oxygen,

695
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,440
fluorine,neon,sodium,magnesium,aluminum,

696
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,110
silicon,phosphorus,sulfur...

697
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:20,080
I can keep going.

698
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,840
we could burn actual wood?

699
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,190
See?That's my favorite part.

700
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,590
You can't--you can't find that anymore.

701
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,880
Look at this.It's gorgeous.

702
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,100
What do you think?

703
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,200
Thank you!This is a fantastic apartment.

704
00:36:29,250 --> 00:36:30,700
-We totally love it. -Love it.Love it.I love it.

705
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:33,770
It was really great of you,izzie.Really,thank you.

706
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,960
you're kidding,right?

707
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,340
You're kidding,right?

708
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,070
Cristina,are you kidding me?

709
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,490
I am getting kicked out of my house.

710
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,140
You think I pulled this off the board for you?

711
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,480
I was asking you to live there with me.

712
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,620
-oh,uh,I'm sorry. -Oh,yeah.

713
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,090
I'm so--wow.Hilarious.

714
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:57,290
But no,I'm sorry.

715
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:58,650
I-- listen,I--I'm-- I'm walking to the bar.

716
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,700
You know what?You are just-- I...

717
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,370
give me the flyer um...

718
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,310
I already put a deposit down.I'm sorry.

719
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,210
I mean,you should've been more clear.

720
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,010
fine.You know what?

721
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,340
It's fine.Keep it.

722
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,680
That's totally fine.You know,enjoy.That's fine!

723
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,320
Thank you.

724
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,200
I get that you're a private .

725
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:34,530
Rson but I am not.I process my stuff out loud.

726
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,580
And I gave up too much of myself in my marriage.

727
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,290
I can'T...

728
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:42,760
give up pieces of myself again.

729
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:46,870
And,uh,mark is my friend.

730
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:56,790
I think I just hate him because he's seen you naked.

731
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,550
what was the point?

732
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,210
All those hours and all that money--

733
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:18,960
what's the point?The world is a horrible place.

734
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,030
Young people die of diseases.

735
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:25,320
It makes absolutely no sense to try to be happy in a world that's such a horrible place.

736
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,100
Yes.

737
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,590
What?

738
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,460
Yes,horrible things do happen.

739
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,890
Happiness in the face of all of that--

740
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,530
that's not the goal.

741
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:42,820
Feeling the horrible and knowing that you're not gonna die from those feelings,

742
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,290
that's the point.

743
00:38:46,450 --> 00:38:47,820
And you're not done.

744
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:52,000
You've made progress because you're feeling and you're telling me about it.

745
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,770
Six months ago,it would've been just you and a bottle of tequila.

746
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,840
My door is always open.

747
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,310
bones break...

748
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,230
organs burst...

749
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,850
flesh tears...

750
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,630
Are you okay?

751
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:20,040
You know,I'm happy for you.

752
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,920
I am.I'm really happy for you and derek

753
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:26,120
and that you guys are moving forward.i am...

754
00:39:27,850 --> 00:39:31,410
I don't know how it happened that I don't have anyone,but...

755
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,960
I don't have anyone.

756
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:43,660
That's not true,iz.

757
00:39:43,930 --> 00:39:45,510
It's not true.

758
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,730
Hello.

759
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:04,080
We can sew the flesh,repair the damage...

760
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,400
ease the pain.

761
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:10,030
I found your mom's vintage martini set.

762
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,250
They're my family.

763
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,310
You can't just assume I'm gonna kick my family out.

764
00:40:19,390 --> 00:40:22,400
And you don't get to announce it to them and ambush me.

765
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:26,720
And you definitely don't get to try to get cristina on your side.

766
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:27,910
They're my family.

767
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,390
They're who I have-- you and them.

768
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,940
Okay.

769
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,690
Okay?

770
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:45,420
I'd like to talk about it again when you're ready.

771
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,670
But for now,okay.

772
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,870
So you still love me?

773
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:03,830
But when life breaks down...

774
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,220
meredith...

775
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,850
when we break down...

776
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:09,230
yes.

777
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:12,970
There's no science,no hard and fast rules.

778
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,230
We just have to feel our way through,

779
00:41:16,230 --> 00:41:20,200
and to a surgeon,there's nothing worse

780
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,050
and there's nothing better.

781
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:25,780
You sure about this,sir?You've had a long day.

782
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,980
It's one thing to stand on a stage and give a speech.

783
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,630
But if I want our teaching program to be the best,and I do,

784
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:37,710
then it starts here,and it starts with me.

785
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,610
I can't do anying about the flood,

786
00:41:42,650 --> 00:41:45,300
but I can give you your shot,o'malley.

787
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,220
You earned it.

788
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:50,140
-You ready? -Yes,sir.

789
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,220
okay.

790
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,240
Three hours.

791
00:41:58,530 --> 00:41:59,970
go.
