1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,510
my mother used to say that for a surgeon,a day without death is a rare gift.

2
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,960
time of death...11:53.

3
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,020
Every day we face death.

4
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,890
Every day we lose life.

5
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,750
time of death...136.

6
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:38,670
Time of death...15:52.

7
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,830
And every day we're hoping for a stay of execution.

8
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,930
What do you remember about it?

9
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:54,310
Uh,we were at home.

10
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:56,930
You were there?

11
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:59,120
Yes,was there.

12
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:06,560
It's okay to talk about it.

13
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,960
Dr.Wyatt,my mother took a scalpel and sliced her wrists in front of me.

14
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,480
and I sat on the kitchen floor in a pool of her blood,

15
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,210
waiting until she passed out so I could call 9-1-1.

16
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:23,260
It's not okay to talk about it.

17
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,970
Why did you wait until she passed out?

18
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:32,830
She asked me not to bere she slit her wrists,

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,210
so I knew I would get in trouble if I tried to save her life.

20
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,360
But you did save her life.

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,420
She didn't want it saved.

22
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,800
You must be very angry at her.

23
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,390
No.

24
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,750
Not at her.

25
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:52,760
Who are you angry at?

26
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,580
We're attached to death.

27
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:00,150
chained.

28
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,360
like prisoners.

29
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:06,270
captives.

30
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,360
- Do you want to dance it out?
- No.

31
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,170
- Do you want to drink tequila?
- No.

32
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:17,750
Do you want to call me names,mock me endlessly?

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,760
No.

34
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,030
- I'm trying to cheer you up.
- Yeah?Well,stop it.

35
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,240
It's annoying.

36
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,350
And it's not working.

37
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,130
I'm deep in the wilderness here.

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,030
do you want the sparkle pager?

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,700
That's not funny.

40
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,290
You're sad.Actually sad.

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,160
Do you know how I know it's the right thing to do to give you the sparkle pager?

42
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,500
Because you're so sad,you're not even asking me for it.

43
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,100
Shiny,shiny pager with lots of shiny,shiny surgeries.

44
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,910
If I were the kind of person who kissed people,I would kiss you.

45
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,940
I tried to change.

46
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,290
turn over a new leaf.

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,180
But the leaf isn't turning you weren't ready to change.

48
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,830
And that's okay.

49
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,630
Adele wanted me to change,to retire.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,970
Well,I'm still the chief,and this weekend,I'm moving back home.

51
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,360
- Does adele know that?
- She'll be fine.

52
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,340
She was wrong.I was right.

53
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,140
And now we're... doing it like bunnies.

54
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,740
I can't change.I can't change.I can't change.

55
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,620
Be who you are.

56
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,580
I am who I am.

57
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,670
A man.

58
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,150
A man.

59
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:39,590
A man who is who he is... I have a right to be that man.

60
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,540
I'm not gonna say anything.

61
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,850
No judging.

62
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,830
I'm gonna miss living on the land.

63
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,750
It is a beautiful piece of land.

64
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,580
Wanna buy it?

65
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,390
You can't sell this land.

66
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,670
You have blueprints.

67
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,360
This is ur living room window.

68
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,630
The house that derek built.

69
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,510
Yeah,well,that's over.

70
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,380
I'm thinking about getting a place in town.

71
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,490
But you love this land.

72
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,190
This land d ferry boats are who you are.

73
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,240
A man can change.

74
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,980
I'm selling the land.

75
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,750
And ferry boats.

76
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,360
crash.

77
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,420
- Morning.
- Hey.

78
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:28,900
all right.

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,450
Here we go.

80
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,840
Come N.

81
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,500
hey,can you take my cases this morning?

82
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,930
Check in on my post-ops?

83
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,080
You're not coming to work?

84
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:40,180
Nah,I'm gonna hang with rebecca,watch movies.

85
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,430
So if you could cover for me.

86
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,930
hey,take a bite.

87
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,030
Yeah,I'll cover for you.

88
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:49,000
Um,alex.she's not looking very good.

89
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,310
She's fine.

90
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,880
come on.Take a bite.

91
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,670
Dr.Bailey,I got an answer for you from the chief about your schedule.

92
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,080
He said you're not spending enough hours in the O.R.

93
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,440
Between the clinic and your chief resident work.

94
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:12,160
You need to spend at least 15 to 20 more hours per week in surgery

95
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,040
in order to sit for your boards.

96
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,340
Should I tell the chief that's possible?

97
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,570
- Dr.Bailey?
- Hush.

98
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,350
I'm trying to see something.

99
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:24,890
When I'm trying to see something,I can't do it if you're asking me questions.

100
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,270
What are you trying to see?

101
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,860
Dr.Bailey,listen,I am really worried about ava.

102
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:33,360
I mean rebecca.I mean alex.Well,alex and rebecca.

103
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,330
who used to be called ava,so that's why I keep...

104
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,960
anyway,listen,she's crazy,d I don't mean funny crazy.Okay?

105
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,730
Alex is home with her right now,and he's all "take a bite,take a bite."

106
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,060
It's weird and sad and.

107
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:46,050
I want to help,but I don't know what to do.

108
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:49,020
So I'm gonna need you to tell me what to do.

109
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,980
- What do I do?
- She's trying to see something.

110
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:51,900
When she's trying to see something,

111
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,340
she doesn't need you in her face asking questions.

112
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,850
You don't see me asking her questions.

113
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,860
What are you trying to see?

114
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,530
The bigger pture.

115
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,600
it's just you and me and erica.

116
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,560
and we're grabbing you,ripping off your clothes.

117
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,030
And then you're naked.You're so hot.

118
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:18,130
and naked.

119
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,770
and then erica starts kissing you.

120
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,050
- hold on a minute.
- Erica's kissing you

121
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,030
like you need to be kissed.

122
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,600
and then I pin your hands.

123
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:29,350
- Hold on a minute.
- above your head.

124
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,160
And then I watch as she uses one finger...

125
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,780
hold on a minute!

126
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,200
Okay,I'm sorry,'cause that was good for me...

127
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,740
that was really,really good for me.Good boy.

128
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,800
But I have a big trauma coming in downstairs,so,

129
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,880
um,we're gonna have to do this the fast way,okay?

130
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,360
every page needs to go in every set of documents.

131
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,370
Miss one,and you're on scut for a month.

132
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,870
These are the most promising set of clinical trial patients yet,

133
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,620
- and I don't want any mistakes.
- hardass.

134
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,590
Where were you last night?

135
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,390
I had to stay with cristina.She needed me.

136
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,580
That's so nice.

137
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,730
But rebecca's at the house.

138
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,530
I needed you.

139
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,880
Apparently she's crazy.

140
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,240
Now,george,we've had this discussion,

141
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,750
and we decided that it's not appropriate to call izzie crazy.

142
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,470
She's spirited.

143
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,450
- Spirited.
- Yeah.Not me!

144
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:19,600
I'm not crazy.Rebecca's crazy.

145
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,260
And...and alex is pretending she's not.

146
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,570
- It's...
- hello.

147
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,250
H...I-I was just helping meredith collate.

148
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,620
I'm on my way to check on your patients right now.

149
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,740
- I swear.
- That's fine.

150
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,500
Take your time.

151
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,440
You seem.

152
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,360
cheerful.

153
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,890
I'm gettin' my groove back.

154
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,380
I'm gettin' ggy with it.

155
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,920
I'm gettin' down with the.

156
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,300
get down.

157
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,210
- Meredith gave me the sparkle pager.
- what?

158
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:41,170
She needed it for her mojo.

159
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,460
Did you ever stop to think that maybe I needed it?

160
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,690
Oh,you'd waste the sparkle pager.

161
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,450
I need it to get out from under hahn.

162
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,240
I won't have to beg her for O.R.Time if I have the pager.

163
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,280
You know,if she's not gonna teach me,I'm gonna teach myself.

164
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,720
She's just gonna use it for evil.

165
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:52,600
I.

166
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,010
I would use it to do good.

167
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,210
And besides,the pager is sacred.

168
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:57,710
Sacred sparkle.

169
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,070
you can't just give it away.

170
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:00,580
You can't do that.Right?She can't do that.

171
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,100
I think it's nontransferable.

172
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,340
You don't make the rules.

173
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,230
but I am the chief's intern.

174
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,720
Uh,you're the chief's bitch.

175
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,910
And you have no power.

176
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,230
because the power...oh!

177
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,100
is in the pager.

178
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,510
Oh,look,that's the chief with something important and powerful.

179
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:19,320
No need for pagers covered with glue and glitter when you work for the chief.

180
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,110
About rebecca...

181
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,680
me and my world-class neurosurgeon are gonna use a brilliant,

182
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:25,540
cutting-edge technique to save a life.

183
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,750
So I don't have time for crazy.Work it out.

184
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,560
A trauma.

185
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:35,840
what do we got?

186
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:36,760
It's not,"what do we got?"

187
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,910
It what do I got,and I don't know yet.

188
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,100
Well,check the sparklpager rules 'cause whatever it is,it's mine now.

189
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,420
- Hey,what do we have?
- I don't know yet.

190
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,270
- I don't know.
- no.

191
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,020
sparkle pager.

192
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,570
You can't sparkle pager it.

193
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,370
It's not her pager.

194
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,780
Uh,yang,it's yours.

195
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:48,980
Stevens,you need to cover the pit.

196
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:51,110
And didn't you volunteer to oversee karev's post-ops?

197
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,390
Yes,-t I- come on.

198
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,190
I don't have time for pettiness.Go

199
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,760
Hey,callie.

200
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,770
Hi.

201
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,960
Hello,erica.

202
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,830
What's the matter with you?

203
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,750
Nothing.

204
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,820
Just...n-nothing.

205
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,630
- You look all hot and bothered.
- NO.

206
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,430
It's just... there's a trauma,and it's really big.

207
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:10,010
That's all.It's big.It's a big trauma.

208
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,210
You're acting weird.

209
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,840
- she uses one finger...
- really big trauma.

210
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:18,590
I swear,torres,it's like you never seen a really big trauma before.

211
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,950
Oh,my.

212
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,560
really big trauma.

213
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,870
So how do you want to handle this?

214
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,470
help me.

215
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:51,340
Really big trauma.

216
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,190
Please.

217
00:09:57,550 --> 00:09:58,670
help me.

218
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:01,940
<font color="#ffff00">Grey's Anatomy
Season Finale</font>

219
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,870
you dared.

220
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,490
him to lay in a vat of cement at a construction site.

221
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,240
We never thought he'd do it.

222
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,070
I-it's andy.

223
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,370
He never does anything.

224
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,360
He doesn't have the guts,right?

225
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:16,850
You just snuck into a construction site and dared your friend...

226
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,220
he's not our friend.

227
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,160
I mean,the four of us,we're friends.

228
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:22,290
But,uh,he's not really r friend.

229
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,640
Okay,you dared him to lie down in concrete.

230
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:28,910
Nobody made m do it.

231
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,580
You're making it sound like we did sometng wrong.

232
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,240
how long?

233
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:35,880
what?

234
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:40,050
How long did your not friend lay in that vat of cement unable to move

235
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,410
before you four geniuses,

236
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,170
you band of brothers,you future mother teresas...

237
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,790
how long did he lay there in that quick drying cement yelling

238
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,730
that he couldn't move before you called the police?

239
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,090
Yeah.

240
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:54,870
That's what I thought.

241
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,410
what do you want to do first?

242
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,890
I don't know.

243
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:05,770
Okay. Well, what do you want us to do first?

244
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,600
I don't know.

245
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,730
All right, look, we blasted him out of the job site,

246
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,460
but we figured, don't blast him too close.

247
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,500
But this is a lot of concrete,

248
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,330
so if you're planning on treating him,

249
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,590
we need to get started.

250
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:19,150
- So what do you want to do?
- I don't know!

251
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:26,720
I'm sorry.

252
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:33,670
Uh,okay,I-I know I'm not doinmy best to instill a sense of confidence in my abilities.

253
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:39,080
Um,you know,it's just that you are trapped in what I'm guessing is several tons of,

254
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:43,720
ment and I've never seen a boy... wait,how old are you?

255
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,170
19.

256
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,870
Then you're a man then.

257
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:51,070
I've never seen a man trapped in several tons of cement before.

258
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,410
But now that I have,I'm gonna figure this out.

259
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,950
Okay,I'm...I'm gonna work with other surgeons,

260
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:59,190
d we're going to figure out a plan and we're gointo save you.

261
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,870
okay,I never,ever promise life,but I'm promising this to you.

262
00:12:05,070 --> 00:12:06,500
Do you understand?

263
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,980
- I do.
- Okay.

264
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:13,930
I-I don't know much yet,but the one thing I do know is that the cement you're encased in

265
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,190
is slowly leeching the water from your body,

266
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:21,320
and you're gonna need all the water you can get,so no crying.

267
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,440
You're a strong young man.

268
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,100
I know you can do this.

269
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,280
Good.

270
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,910
Good.

271
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,290
Okay,you're gonna live.

272
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,560
I'll make sure that you live.

273
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,310
here you go.

274
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,240
hello.

275
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,570
- Hello.
- dr.Grey,is this him?

276
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:51,460
Him?

277
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,940
Oh,she has a pet name for you.

278
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:55,620
The seattle grace brain butcher.

279
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:57,170
Beth.

280
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,090
I'm sorry.

281
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,960
Oh,no,no,that's fine.That's me.

282
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:00,070
- Hi.
- Dr.Shepherd.

283
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,170
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

284
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,580
- Nice to meet you as well.
- Pleasure.

285
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,700
Um,that hand's just for show.

286
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,620
So come on,tell me. How does this work?

287
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,500
You're going to inject a live virus into her tumor?

288
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,330
Mm-hmm.

289
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,450
And that's safe?

290
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,900
Well,the virus is still in testing stages.

291
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:17,480
I've made some adjustments that I hope will destroy the tumor.

292
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,220
Hey,tumor destroyers.

293
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,220
I like that.

294
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,240
Has this ever worked before?

295
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,060
No.

296
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,410
so I'm your lab rat.

297
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,630
- beth.-I'm just saying,if this works,

298
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,120
my name will go down in the annals of some medical book.

299
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,270
That's kinda cool.

300
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,940
Not if I beat you to it.

301
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:33,770
oh,beth.

302
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,560
This is our other clinical trial patient.

303
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,260
Jeremy.

304
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,560
You didn't call.

305
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,400
They know each other?

306
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,430
I thought you backed out.

307
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:42,170
Oh,as if I'd break our pact?

308
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:42,890
Come here.

309
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,060
they know each other.

310
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,090
what is he doing here?

311
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,600
Well,his surgery is this afternoon.

312
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:59,370
I knew she didn't find this clinical trial on her own.

313
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,710
They met when they were both being treated at mayo last year.

314
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,280
They went through chemo together,radiation,joined a support group.

315
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:07,980
you don't want them to be together?

316
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,040
Look,we like jeremy.

317
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,310
He's a good enough kid.

318
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:15,160
And I feel for him that he's going through this alone,but we worry about beth.

319
00:14:15,310 --> 00:14:17,250
She thinks that she's in love with him.

320
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,110
We just don't want her getting so attached to someone that might.

321
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,110
die.

322
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,760
If something happens,if he doesn't survive.

323
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,500
beth won't want to live.

324
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:35,250
She has to want to fight to stay alive.

325
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,050
There's a binder on occupational medicine articles in my office.

326
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,110
There should be a toxicology section.

327
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,120
See if you can find anything on cement. - Yes,sir.

328
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,880
And let shepherd or grey know I need to see th. It's important.

329
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,070
Will do.

330
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,770
Oh,my god. Oh,my god.

331
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,980
My god.

332
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,750
Why...wh... what is everybody doing standing around here?

333
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,010
This is what your guys told us to do.

334
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,760
And exactly where are my guys?

335
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,900
no more time.

336
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,670
This is what we have to do.

337
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,270
I am telling you,I am right.

338
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:20,120
Why is the patient in there and all of you are in here?

339
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,660
dr.Torres is worried about the limbs.

340
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,840
Dr.Bailey is worried about abdominal crush injuries.

341
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,800
dr.Sloan feels the third-degree burns should take the first look,

342
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:31,330
and dr.Uh,Hahneels the heart and lung issues are gonna kill him before,

343
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,510
um,we get to any of this.

344
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,700
So in other words... no one can agree on where to start.

345
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,280
No,I know where to start.

346
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,170
The cement's contracting,and if I don't get in there,

347
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,710
he could lose both of his legs and his right arm.

348
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,860
Well,he can live without a leg.

349
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,050
I'd like to see him live without a liver.

350
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,970
So we're saying we'd prefer him to suffer a longslow painful death

351
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,270
as the alkaline in the cement continues to burn through his skin?

352
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,050
You can't just start chipping away.

353
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:20,540
Once his circulation opens up,the built-up toxins will stop his heart,

354
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,950
not to mention rhabdomyol... -we could treat that with dialysis.

355
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,100
Yang,let us work.

356
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,530
Chief,I found an article,but it doesn't say a lot.

357
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,460
I can put in a swan-ganz.

358
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,940
People encased in cement are also usually at the bottom of a river. That's going a little overboard.

359
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,100
You are so wrong.

360
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,810
I'm so wrong?

361
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:31,430
you are. Wrong.

362
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:32,570
You two working together on this?

363
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,870
Okay,everybody stand down!

364
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,740
We are fighting the clock,people.

365
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,470
It took one hour for the kids to call 9-1-1.

366
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,990
It took three hours for search andeescu to get this guy cut out of the cement.

367
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:47,070
That gives us less than four to six hours to get him out of e cement and into the O.R.

368
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:48,540
Before he is dead.

369
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,000
Now we are figing one hell of a clock.

370
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,380
Every minute counts.

371
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:56,150
We work as a team or that man dies.

372
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:57,540
Do you understand?

373
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:59,060
Yes,sir.Of course.

374
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,340
Where do you want me,chief?

375
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,320
Go find grey and be her intern for the day.

376
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,710
I already have too many bodies in the room.

377
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,610
What's the patient's name?

378
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,990
Andrew langston.

379
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,970
Okay,let's go save his life.

380
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,590
Hey.

381
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,490
You intimidate me a little.

382
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:23,860
I mean,you're not an intimidating person,

383
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,780
but the legend.of meredith and derek.

384
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,050
it'S.

385
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:31,000
intimidating.

386
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:32,340
There's no legend.

387
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,410
He's selling his land because of you.

388
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,750
There's a legend.

389
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,570
Derek's selling his land?

390
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:39,320
He doesn't say it's because of you,

391
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,570
but he was making plans to build a house when the two of you were together,

392
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,910
and now... I'm...I'm not trying to.

393
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,030
I just really like him.

394
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,170
And you.

395
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:53,150
intimidate me.

396
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,670
There's no legend.

397
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,530
Okay.

398
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,830
Okay.

399
00:18:02,810 --> 00:18:03,800
Okay.

400
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,600
izzie had a question about some post-ops.

401
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,910
what'd I miss?

402
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,110
What?

403
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,850
The movie,what'd I miss?

404
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,860
hey.Hey.

405
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,050
I'm sorry.

406
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,800
Don't be sorry.

407
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:36,680
I think.

408
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,010
I wet my pants.

409
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:48,240
Oh,that's,uh,that's okay.

410
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,000
that's...that's okay.

411
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,970
I'll do better.

412
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,440
I promise.

413
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:57,870
Don't worry about it.

414
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,980
You're doing fine.

415
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:05,520
come on.

416
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,770
I forgot to tell you.

417
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:10,000
Guess who called me.

418
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,700
Carrie from our support group?

419
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,060
Have you talked to her lately?

420
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,920
No,she.

421
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,020
oh,god.

422
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:23,370
Her husband said that they tried radiation one last time,but he said it was bad.

423
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,860
The last day,she didn't even recognize him.

424
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,650
And the pain.

425
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:29,350
hey.

426
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,760
At least we don't have to worry about that.

427
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,110
You know?

428
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,990
This surgery will work.

429
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:37,920
Okay?

430
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:42,750
And...and if it doesn't,at least we'll die quick.

431
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,980
dr.Grey,I thought we talked about changing beth's room.

432
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,780
The room is fine,and it's right down the hall from jeremy.

433
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,110
I'd like to move her as soon as possible.

434
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:01,130
I'm sorry,mrs.Monroe,

435
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,350
I checked,and there aren't any beds available.

436
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,280
Not in a private room.

437
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,780
mom,why don't you go find dad?

438
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,760
Uh,I-I can wait for him here.

439
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:21,340
mom,why don't you go find dad so I can kiss jeremy without you watching?

440
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,990
I think it's time jeremy went back to... mom,I don't understand wh...

441
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,520
nurse!

442
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,420
I need a nurse

443
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,690
He's seizing!

444
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,010
Let's run a second set of labs before surgery.

445
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,820
How's beth?

446
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,730
Was sh...was she scared? Or.

447
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,640
oh,she's fine.

448
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:49,020
Uh,the chief wants to talk to you or shepherd.

449
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,440
He says it's important.I'll go.

450
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,430
And he put me on you today.

451
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,590
So what can I do? How can I help?

452
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,770
Oh,you can,uh,run labs for me.

453
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,840
Labs,that's it?

454
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,050
Yeah. Thanks.

455
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,760
Hi.

456
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:12,490
What's that?

457
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:17,370
I'm pouring vinegar on your flesh to minimize the burns inside your skin caused by the cement.

458
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,250
I'm burning from the inside out?

459
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,150
I'm dying.

460
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,460
I'm dying,aren't I?

461
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,360
Hey,hey,andrew. That word's not allowed anymore.

462
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,590
I'm banning that word from your vocabulary.

463
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,970
Can you move your fingers?

464
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,750
That's very good.

465
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,520
I'm not usually this dumb.

466
00:21:37,710 --> 00:21:38,820
I make the dean's list.

467
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,050
I tutor.

468
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:41,670
I'm...I'm not.

469
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:45,920
I'm not uslly the guy who's dumb enough to jump into a tub of cement for a girl.

470
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,690
Wait,not the girl you came in with?

471
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,100
You did this for her?

472
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:53,600
Lola.

473
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,990
The guys dared me.

474
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,540
She was watching.

475
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,080
And I.

476
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,350
she was wching.

477
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:09,820
And now not only is she totally unimpressed,but now after I'm gone,

478
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:15,640
she'll remember me forever as the idiot who was dumb enough to jump into a tub of cement.

479
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:16,400
Hey,come on.

480
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,750
We all mess up.

481
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:21,630
I'm the guy who ed in a block of cement trying to impress a girl.

482
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,360
I'm like han solo.

483
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:28,600
In "star wars"?

484
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,590
He was encased in carbonite?

485
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,710
you wanted to see me?

486
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,360
I,uh,I got a call from the I.R.B....

487
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,840
The national board that oversees and reviews clinical trials.

488
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,830
You've had 11 deaths.

489
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,250
They're giving you one last patient.

490
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:48,110
You get it today under the wire,and hope for the best.

491
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:52,120
At midnight,if you lose him,they're gonna shut you down,period.

492
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:53,780
One last patient.

493
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,770
You're angry at him... the chief.

494
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,640
But why? Why am I angry at him?

495
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,940
Because you have opened up your past.

496
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,160
It's like you're reliving it all right now.

497
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,310
You're angry with him.

498
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,420
You're angry with your mother.

499
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,440
You're angry with yourself.

500
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,460
The chief went back to his wife.

501
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,730
My mother didn't want to live.

502
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,600
I get that.

503
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,750
He did what he had to do.

504
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:15,790
She did what she had to do.

505
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:17,610
Meredith,I don't think your mother wanted to kill herself.

506
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,910
No,she did.

507
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,700
How can you be sure?

508
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,940
How can you be sure she didn't?

509
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,090
You weren't there.

510
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,780
The answer is right in front of you.

511
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,550
Think about it.

512
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,620
the I.R.B. Is saying I failed?

513
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:31,760
You haven't failed yet.

514
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,560
I failed meredith.

515
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,500
I'll sign the discharge order for beth.

516
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,730
No,you can't send beth home.

517
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:36,720
This surgery is her last shot.

518
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,950
You have until midnight.

519
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:38,980
Jeremy's surgery's today.

520
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,400
So you move jeremy's surgery up.

521
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:41,480
We do beth's this afternoon.

522
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,450
You can fit them both in before the midnight deadline.

523
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:45,150
Damn it.If I could just get the virus dosage right.

524
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:47,110
Right. We're so close. You haven't failed.

525
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,810
Yeah,but are we going too far here?

526
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:50,200
These are people's lives.

527
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,640
is my ego too big here?

528
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:55,350
Your ego is just the right size.

529
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,460
We can do this.

530
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,550
Two patients.

531
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,520
Bends the rules without breaking 'em.

532
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,050
You'll clear it with the chief?

533
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,280
Yeah.

534
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,890
Jeremy's going into surgery soon?

535
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,160
In a couple of hours.

536
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,380
How is he?

537
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,370
Oh,he's stable.

538
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,540
Yeah?-Yeah,he's actually better than stable.

539
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,890
He called me the angel of death.

540
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,420
he's good then.

541
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,350
Can I see him?

542
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,580
Honey,no.

543
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,710
Oh,I'll just be gone a few minutes.

544
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:31,420
Can you get me a wheelchair,please?

545
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,400
If you're going to have surgery today,you need to rest.

546
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,320
You don't need to be... oh... we just want to spend some time with you.

547
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,430
That's all.

548
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:39,690
Please.

549
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,440
We're the last two.

550
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,830
What?

551
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,530
From our support group.

552
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,740
Jeremy and I are the last two still alive.

553
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,690
Hey.

554
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,690
Have you seen cristina?

555
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,080
Because I've done everything I know to do,

556
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:06,010
everything I'm supposed to do,but if she sees me doing nothing,

557
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,800
I am not in the mood to get yelled at today.

558
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,150
She's in with the cement boy.

559
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,690
There's a cement boy? Don't bother.

560
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,030
They don't need interns in... they don't want interns in there.

561
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,420
Interns are in the way!

562
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,970
I'm not complaining.

563
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,780
Two minutes. Two minutes of complaining between me and you.

564
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,560
No one has to know.

565
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,470
I have all this power!

566
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,890
Supposedly.

567
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,580
I supposedly am imbued with the power of being the chief's intern.

568
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,510
But there's a cement boy,and I'm stuck in here,

569
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,500
running labs and researching the effects of cement on the human body

570
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,240
in the vain hopes that somebody asks me a question.

571
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,330
I'm not in with the cement boy because even though I have all this power,

572
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:42,070
I can't use it because it's not real power.

573
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,820
It's fake power?

574
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,970
Fake power.

575
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:47,380
I can go into the chief's office whenever I want.

576
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,490
You know what he has in there?

577
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:49,440
Files.

578
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:52,210
Confidential files on every resident in this hospital.

579
00:25:52,330 --> 00:25:54,710
And I'm just allowed in,and he's not worried

580
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,030
because he knows and I know that I don't have any real power.

581
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,050
I don't have the power to look at those files.

582
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,800
Would it make you feel better if you could look at the files?

583
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,420
You know what would make me feel better?

584
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,310
It would make me feel better if I could feel like there was a reason for this,

585
00:26:07,430 --> 00:26:08,500
that there was a point.

586
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:12,600
Oh,god.

587
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,540
My poor,poor parents.

588
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,360
How would they face anyone at the funeral?

589
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,210
Oh,okay,andrew,you're gonna make a lot mistakes in your life,

590
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,310
but mistakes are...they're... they're just pieces.

591
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:26,750
Like this is a foolish piece,but,you know,it's just a piece.

592
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,610
You need to be proud of the whole picture.

593
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:31,310
The whole picture defines you,not just this one piece.

594
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:37,070
I'm a loser.I'm a loser.I'm a loser.I'm a loser.

595
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,670
- Come on.Uh,andrew.
- I'm a loser.

596
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:42,270
Andrew.Hey,hey,l-listen to me.

597
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,570
Han solo is not a loser.

598
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,540
Han solo got encased in carbonite,and...and that was a big mess,

599
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,270
but that's not what he's remembered for.

600
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,490
He's remembered as the guy who made the kessel run in less than 12 parsecs

601
00:26:54,610 --> 00:26:57,620
and who braved the subzero temperatures of the ice planet hoth

602
00:26:57,690 --> 00:27:01,240
in order to save someone he cared about from the big,ugly wampa.

603
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:03,970
He is remembered as the guy who swooped down at the last minute,

604
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:08,080
blasted darth vader out of the sky so that luke could use the force and...

605
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,650
and destroy the damn "death star," okay?

606
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,670
Princess leia saved him from the carbonite.

607
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,100
and they fell in love and they saved the universe

608
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:21,270
and had twin jedi babies that went on to save the universe again.

609
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,330
Right?Now that's the whole picture.

610
00:27:23,430 --> 00:27:25,890
The carbonite,it was just a piece,okay?

611
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,150
yeah.

612
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:36,090
What?So I like science fiction.Somebody got a problem with that?

613
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:38,850
- no.no.It's great.
- no,not at all.Cool.

614
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:41,040
Do what you doing.

615
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:50,820
so I got jeremy's labs back,and he's good to go for surgery.

616
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,000
Chief sign off on that?

617
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:53,340
Y-yeah.

618
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,360
where are you going?

619
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,610
Get a wheelchair.

620
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:00,070
what are you doing?

621
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,600
My...my mom went to go call my grandma,and my dad went to the cafeteria.

622
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:07,110
There wasn't a wheelchair in my room.

623
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,450
I just want to see jeremy.Please.

624
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,420
I don't want the seizure to be the last time I see him.

625
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:14,540
Please.I-I just need to see him.Please let me see him.

626
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,920
Okay,let's go.

627
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,870
To getto be alone with jeremy?

628
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,760
I mean "alone" alone?

629
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,520
Alone?

630
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,770
We've never done it,either of us.

631
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,750
We've been waiting until we both were tumor free,

632
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:31,060
but the surgery... anything could happen.

633
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,920
We can do it,right?

634
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,800
It...it...it won't kill us or anything?

635
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,870
No,no.

636
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,650
No,it won't kill you.

637
00:28:39,770 --> 00:28:42,110
I mean,you've done it,right?

638
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,320
With each other?

639
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,950
He...I've...he's done... he's done it,and I've done it,yeah.

640
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:50,300
What's it like?Is it magical?

641
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,850
Yes.

642
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:52,790
It can be.

643
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,550
With the right person.

644
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,120
I'm gonngo get you some clothes.

645
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,570
You got shampoo in there?

646
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,030
I don't understand.

647
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,820
I don't understand.

648
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,650
I was pregnant.

649
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,480
I was pregnant.

650
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,510
I know I was.

651
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:20,640
I was pregnant.I don't know.

652
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,530
It's okay.

653
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,750
I don'T.

654
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:24,400
it's okay.

655
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:26,830
- I...
- you just got confused.That's all.

656
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:29,390
You just got confused,okay?

657
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,160
okay....

658
00:29:37,410 --> 00:29:49,540
* I was a little girl alone in my little world for me *

659
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:53,230
* I played pretend between the trees *

660
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,300
* and fed my houseguests bark and leaves *

661
00:29:56,360 --> 00:30:01,540
* and laughed in my pretty bed of green *

662
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:05,150
* I had a dream *

663
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:14,620
* that I could fly from the highest swing I had a dream *

664
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,300
I have never in my life gotten a patient laid

665
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,190
much less two patients.

666
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,200
It's really sweet.

667
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:27,840
We're pimps.

668
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,700
yentas.

669
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,880
- they're so in love.
- Oh,yeah.

670
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:36,240
It's all new and fresh and exciting.

671
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,230
I've never been a fan of new.

672
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,950
I like to know the person,their bodies,what makes them moan.

673
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,470
Oh,boy.

674
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:46,640
Did something happen?Beth isn't in her om.

675
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:52,060
Oh,well,that's because I had my intern take her down for a pre-op M.R.I.

676
00:30:52,150 --> 00:30:53,130
Thank god.

677
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,620
I was afraid she was lying somewhere in pain.

678
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,040
No,she's noin any pain.

679
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,460
We should go to the conference room

680
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:03,050
because there's lots of clinical trial paperwork that you haven't filled out yet.

681
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:04,540
- Thank you.
- You bet.

682
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,420
Yep,I'll be here,doing my thing.

683
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,120
all right,it's at 20 centimeters.Inflate the balloon,yang.

684
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:14,890
I am.

685
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:16,620
All right.So then inflate it more.

686
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,780
Yes,dr.Hahn.

687
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,460
Every time they loosen another piece of concrete,this leg swells even more.

688
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,980
His pressure is 18.

689
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,140
All right,does he have a pulse with that?

690
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,700
I always did enjoy a good game of twister.

691
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,660
It's finished.I'm in.

692
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,390
Yang,do not sew that in.

693
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:41,050
Hold it.I will check your work when I'm done.

694
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,390
Chief,I've gotta do a fasciotomy.

695
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,630
What?A what?

696
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,220
we've got to relieve the pressure in your leg or you could lose the entire limb.

697
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,550
Don't worry.

698
00:31:50,670 --> 00:31:52,590
You probably won't feel a thing.

699
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,500
Oh,god.

700
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,150
Hey,dr.Stevens.

701
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,840
What's going down?

702
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,830
What's going down?

703
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,670
Cristina sparkle paging me out of cement boy.

704
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,740
Alex not answering the phone... alex and his insane girlfriend.

705
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,930
Alex!Alex!

706

Definitely.

721
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:10,170
I don't think,um.

722
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:15,270

00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,520

Yeah.Yeah.

728
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,370
What if you die?

729
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,860
I won'T.

730
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,140
What if I die?

731
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,110
You won'T.

732
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,050
Okay,but.

733
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,930
you changed my life,jeremy west.

734
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:53,930
You made it better,you made it brighter,

735
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,670
- full of joy,and if I die...
- don't you dareie.

736
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:01,380
Okay?

737
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,470
We're not finished yet.

738
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,830
I'm not finished loving you.

739
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,240
Okay,go ahead.

740
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,570
Go ahead.Get your head chopped open.

741
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,460
I'm right behind you.

742
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,240
do not kill him.

743
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,910
you nervous?

744
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,110
I have my ego to keep me warm.

745
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,590
Can't you feel it?

746
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:02,590
What?

747
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,750
The majesty of lifesaving.

748
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,470
When did you become an optimist?

749
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,540
Selling your land.

750
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,160
trying to move forward.

751
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,430
So am I.

752
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,990
who's there?

753
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,700
george o'malley.

754
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,580
I was paged to the supply closet.

755
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,940
Are you alone?

756
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,420
lexie?

757
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:36,720
Um,remember how I said I wasn't a thief?

758
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,000
I think maybe I am.

759
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,220
alexandra caroline grey.

760
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:43,270
I couldn't help it.

761
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,100
I had to know.And then once I knew,i knew.

762
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,850
No,we have to get these back to the chief's office right now.

763
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:49,300
It doesn't matter now.I know.I read them all.

764
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,740
I tried to stop reading,but I couldn't,

765
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,800
and I have a photographic memory,

766
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,330
which is how I got through harvard med... my photographic memory.

767
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,980
And I read all the files,and the information is now burned into my brain,

768
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,960
- and I read your file...
- no,no,I don't wanna know.

769
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,740
George,you failed the intern exam by one point.

770
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,610
One point.

771
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,850
the O.R.Is booked and standing by.

772
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,340
dr.Bailey,what is it?

773
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,890
something.

774
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,700
we're missing.

775
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,710
we're forgetting something.

776
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:45,100
Gangrene,compartment syndrome,compression,fluid balance,electrolytes.

777
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:46,700
What is it?

778
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,960
What is it?

779
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:53,350
Gangrene,compartment syndrome,compression,fluids,electrolytes.

780
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:58,000
Gangrene,compartment syndrome,compression,fluids,electrolytes.

781
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:03,700
Gangrene,compartment syndrome,compression,fluids,elec...

782
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,980
bladder. His bladder.

783
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:11,910
We've been hydrating him and hydrating him for over four hour now.

784
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,890
Oh,if we don't get a catheter in him quick.

785
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:15,850
his bladder's gonna explode.

786
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,010
Can I have mayo?

787
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,560
See?

788
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,700
You have an appetite.

789
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:28,500
That's a good sign.

790
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:34,620
hey,iz.I'll be right back.

791
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,060
- What's going on?
- How's rebecca?

792
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:40,090
She's fine.What do you need?

793
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,580
Did she eat?Did you call her husband?

794
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,880
- Iz...
- Don't get mad at me because I care.

795
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,490
Not caring.Butting in.

796
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,140
I'm butting in because I care.

797
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,240
You know how you care?

798
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,030
By covering me at work,not by calling me every hour and asking... hang on.

799
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,640
- Rebecca?
- Alex?

800
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,240
Rebecca?

801
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,780
Alex?

802
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:07,980
time of death...11:47.

803
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:18,440
rebecca!

804
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,100
You don't have to say any....thing.Don't say it.

805
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:41,220
alex?

806
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,820
Are you still there?

807
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:44,420
Alex?

808
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,810
- I'm so sorry.
- Don'T.

809
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,180
don't say anything.

810
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:56,020
Okay?Don'T...say...anything.

811
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,020
Don't say anything.

812
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:01,370
Don't say anything.

813
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,720
Don't you say anything to me.

814
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:10,340
Don't say anything.Don't say anything.......

815
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,270
what happened?

816
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,480
I need betadine,saline and a suture kit.

817
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:33,900
- What happened?
- She cut herself.

818
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,970
It was an accident.

819
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,970
I've got this.

820
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,920
How much blood has she lost?

821
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,380
- Alex.
- she's fine.

822
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:41,850
I've got this.

823
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:48,280
given the situation,I would understand if you didn't want to proceed with the surgery.

824
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:53,980
But we did learn from jeremy,and the formulation of the viral cocktail will be adjusted.

825
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,590
We have not yet had a positive outcome.

826
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,260
Liz?

827
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,830
I want to take her home.

828
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,390
I understand.

829
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,300
No.I want the surgery.

830
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,150
Honey.

831
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,640
honey,that's the grief talking.

832
00:40:08,690 --> 00:40:11,000
I want the surgery today.

833
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,680
Well,there are no other clinical trials out there.

834
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,870
No one else has any answers.

835
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:19,580
Dr.Shepherd has worke very hard on this...

836
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,870
meredith.

837
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:25,500
We're not letting you have the surgery because you want to die with jeremy.

838
00:40:25,530 --> 00:40:28,210
If I go home,I die.

839
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:31,910
I die in a few weeks,a few days.

840
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:34,920
I don't want to lose you.

841
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,030
Mom.

842
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,920
you won'T.

843
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:43,050
because I'm not finished.

844
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,050
Daddy.

845
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,630
he loved me.

846
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:52,090
Yeah,you know,jeremy really loved me.

847
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:58,250
And he'd be so mad if...if I just gave up.

848
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:01,280
Please.

849
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,940
do the surgery today.

850
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,480
lola.

851
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:13,660
Andrew's asking for you.

852
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,070
So could you come with me,please?

853
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,150
hey,um,is,uh,is he okay?

854
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:22,880
No,he's not okay.

855
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,910
He's stuck in a block of cement.

856
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,880
actual hardening-by-the-second,concrete cement.

857
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,740
How could he possibly be okay?

858
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:35,930
You care about him.

859
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:40,690
He's my friend.

860
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:45,250
I,um,I know I told you he wasn't,but he'sy friend.

861
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,870
I think he's more than that.

862
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:53,270
And I think you're too proud to admit it to your friends and maybe even to yourself.

863
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:56,460
mommy,I have a boo-boo.Kiss it better.

864
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:04,680
hey,he is in pain,he is scared,and he needs someone he knows to hold his hand.

865
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,440
Lola.Hold my hand.

866
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,610
sew what they think.

867
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,070
This matters.

868
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,830
They don'T.

869
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,860
I can't help him.

870
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:25,140
You're gonna hate yourself for this.

871
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,410
Later.

872
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:30,590
you're gonna hate yourself for this,and you'll be right.

873
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,610
I don't think this looks right.

874
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,920
Cristina is dyslexic,but she got straight a's all during med school and she has a phd.

875
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,790
It's pretty amazing.

876
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,690
Eight letters of recommendation in her file.

877
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:49,370
Does this look right?

878
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:50,430
Is this how it was when you found 'em?

879
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,820
Izzie went to college at night.

880
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,750
It took her six years to graduate,and she volunteered as a candy striper.

881
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,150
Patients wrote her letters of rec.

882
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,880
We gotta get outta here before someone catches us.

883
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:04,170
and alex...he wrote this essay to get in,this moving,

884
00:43:04,250 --> 00:43:06,730
beautiful essay about how his grades weren't that good during med school

885
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:09,310
because he was suffering from testicular cancer.

886
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:10,920
- What?
- He said he lost a ball.

887
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,090
but I've seen him naked.

888
00:43:12,110 --> 00:43:14,140
He has two mangerines,george,two pouch potatoes.

889
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:15,110
He lied.He's a liar.

890
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,770
Stop telling me information I don't wanna know.

891
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,100
One point.Just one point.

892
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:19,650
How can they keep you back for one point?

893
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,520
Just forget about it.

894
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,700
Photographic memory.

895
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,650
I can'T.

896
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,160
We'll get it right with beth.

897
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,410
She just lost the love of her life.

898
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:29,050
How could you encourage her to do the surgery?

899
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:30,400
How could you encourage her not to?

900
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,540
You know,it's not me with the big ego,it's you.

901
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:33,640
You backed me into a corner there.

902
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,160
What was I supposed to do,say no?

903
00:43:35,210 --> 00:43:36,220
- Derek...
- I can'T.

904
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:37,710
She's a kid.

905
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:39,640
She's a kid who's gonna die without the surgery.

906
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:41,050
She'll die with the surgery.

907
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:44,810
That's what you and i do together,we kill things over and over and over again.

908
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,160
We've killed 12 people,and now because of you,I will kill a 13th.

909
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,700
When beth's surgery's over,we're done.

910
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,280
I don't want to work with you,I don't want to see you,I don't want to talk to you.

911
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:54,730
We're done.

912
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:05,680
okay,andy,we're ready to begin.

913
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,090
Oh,wait.

914
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,650
is she.

915
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,790
lola?

916
00:44:09,890 --> 00:44:11,910
Uh,she... I couldn't find her.

917
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,160
Uh,she went to eat or something.

918
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:15,750
we need to start the catheter.

919
00:44:16,310 --> 00:44:17,360
Okay.

920
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:20,050
Now you're gonna feel some pressure.

921
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:22,120
She didn't go to eat.

922
00:44:22,180 --> 00:44:24,240
She just didn't want to come,right?

923
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,300
Lola likes to hang out with me.

924
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:34,300
Or she did... used to... before I did this.

925
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,810
Once,she almost.

926
00:44:37,430 --> 00:44:41,700
there,uh,coulda been a kiss,but I.

927
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,800
chickened out.

928
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:45,250
Yeah,well,maybe you don't need to be kissing her.

929
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,850
No,I do.

930
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:49,230
I do.I do need to be kissing her.

931
00:44:49,250 --> 00:44:50,710
My whole life is about kissing her.

932
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:51,750
okay,catheter's in.

933
00:44:51,810 --> 00:44:53,890
The guys are on their last piece of cement.

934
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:57,920
thank god.

935
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,440
The hard part's over.Right?

936
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:01,440
- The hard part's over?
- Yang,get a crash cart ready.

937
00:45:01,510 --> 00:45:03,880
All right,I've got calcium.

938
00:45:03,890 --> 00:45:07,980
d50 and insulin.Ready.

939
00:45:08,260 --> 00:45:09,680
The hard part is over?

940
00:45:10,990 --> 00:45:15,620
Okay,um,there is a chance that when the nice gentlemen

941
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:20,020
take off the final piece of cement there on your abdomen,

942
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:23,100
all the toxins that have been building up underneath the concrete

943
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:26,760
will rush to your heart,and you'll crash.

944
00:45:26,830 --> 00:45:30,360
And you...your heart will stop and you'll stop breathing.

945
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,380
Um,but no,there's no need to make that face because we will restart your heart,

946
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:38,010
and we will put in a tube that will breathe for you and r...

947
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,320
and rush you right to e O.R.,Okay?

948
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,060
We are good at what we do.

949
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:48,400
Just,if you see the warm,welcoming light,do not go into it.

950
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,660
let's go.

951
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,260
okay,we're gonna do this on three.

952
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:56,830
Okay,one.

953
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,470
all right,watch the leads.

954
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,590
Two.

955
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:03,950
Three.

956
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:11,320
There he goes.

957
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,480
clear his airway.

958
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:15,700
all right.

959
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:18,570
One,two.

960
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,800
three.

961
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,200
Easy,easy,easy.

962
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:23,870
watch his head.push the lidocaine,vec and versed.

963
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:24,520
bailey.

964
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,840
got the intubation.

965
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:27,110
Go.

966
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:30,570
What do you mean?

967
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:33,170
I don't know what you mean when you say she didn't want to die.

968
00:46:33,190 --> 00:46:37,560
When you were sitting on the floor with your mother,what did she say to you?

969
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,660
She told me to be extraordinary.

970
00:46:41,710 --> 00:46:44,720
She said that she had failed,but that I should be extraordinary,

971
00:46:44,770 --> 00:46:47,070
that I shouldn't depend on anyone.

972
00:46:49,050 --> 00:46:52,190
"Be an extraordinary woman,meredith," is what she said.

973
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:54,960
And so you became a surgeon,just like her.

974
00:46:55,030 --> 00:46:55,650
Yes.

975
00:46:55,670 --> 00:46:58,830
Which means you have all the tools to figure this out for yourself.

976
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:02,290
But I just... you need to work this through,meredith.

977
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,810
I promise you,when you do,you're gonna be glad.

978
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,180
my head is exploding.

979
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,580
Make it unexplode.

980
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:23,190
Are.

981
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:25,010
- are you mad at me?
- no

982
00:47:25,450 --> 00:47:27,080
Then why are you talking to me in that voice?

983
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:27,760
There's no voice.

984
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,950
There's a voice.

985
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,350
and I did you a favor.

986
00:47:30,450 --> 00:47:31,870
But you didn't do me a favor.

987
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:35,460
You just made it clear that I'm still me...the almost guy.

988
00:47:35,500 --> 00:47:39,090
All that separates me from the rest of my class is one point,one point?

989
00:47:39,140 --> 00:47:42,690
I mean,it would've been okay if it was 50 points or even ten points,but one?

990
00:47:42,750 --> 00:47:47,020
That means it was right there,it was in my hand,and I let it slip away.

991
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,560
It...I didn't want to know that.

992
00:47:48,650 --> 00:47:49,780
Do you get that?

993
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,500
That knowing that if I had just,what,checked "a" instead of "b," that.

994
00:47:53,950 --> 00:47:55,480
that that one point separates me from freedom.

995
00:47:55,500 --> 00:48:03,140
I have been running my tail off,busting my ass to make up for one lousy point,proving.

996
00:48:05,970 --> 00:48:06,690
you didn't do me a favor.

997
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,110
Don't kid yourself.

998
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:13,590
Well,at least.

999
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:15,190
now you know you have what it takes.

1000
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:16,450
Yeah.

1001
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:23,710
This arm's almost bandaged,then we're gonna move to the other one,okay?

1002
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,350
Okay.

1003
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:28,560
I've prescribed her alpralam and clonazepam.

1004
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:29,820
Psych will be down within an hour,

1005
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:32,420
but I thought it'd be good to have something to keep her calm until they get here.

1006
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:35,520
She doesn't need any drugs or any psych.

1007
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,190
She needs a psych consult to be admitted.

1008
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,040
Look,I'm not admitting her.

1009
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,080
You're not taking her home.

1010
00:48:41,130 --> 00:48:42,610
I was watching her every minute until you called.

1011
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:44,900
You shouldn't have to watch her every minute.

1012
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,420
You're not on today,so she was admitted under my name,

1013
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:49,010
which means I get to decide the treatment plan.

1014
00:48:49,070 --> 00:48:50,220
She needs to be put on a hold so...

1015
00:48:50,230 --> 00:48:53,480
damn it!Would you leave us alone,you stupid bitch?

1016
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:09,570
You're supposed to be sitting down.

1017
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:11,070
That's what the breaks are for.

1018
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:13,220
We've been on our feet over nine hours.Rest your legs.

1019
00:49:13,230 --> 00:49:15,030
My legs are good.

1020
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:19,130
It's inappropriate,don't you think,thinng about sex during surgery?

1021
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,510
I'm just saying what I've been witnessing all day.

1022
00:49:21,630 --> 00:49:25,120
This poor kid's entire body was encased in cement.

1023
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:30,600
His legs are crushed,his vessels and nerves nearly cut off completely,and still.

1024
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,300
I was turned on.

1025
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:36,620
this entire time,I've been turned on because of you and your dirty talk.

1026
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,300
It wasn't my dirty talk.

1027
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,540
It's what I was dirty talking about.

1028
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:41,410
What?

1029
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,640
Erica.

1030
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,920
You and erica.

1031
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,650
no.

1032
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:46,690
That'S.

1033
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,760
- no.
- Callie.

1034
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,600
- what?
- It's okay.

1035
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:52,420
I wish I was all someone thought about.

1036
00:50:00,350 --> 00:50:03,410
You had 14 letters of recommendation.

1037
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:11,830
Cristina had eight,meredith had four,izzie had 10,but you had 14.

1038
00:50:11,890 --> 00:50:13,540
And the words that they used to describe you...

1039
00:50:13,590 --> 00:50:16,030
nobody had recommendations like yours.

1040
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:19,370
People said the others were smart,they said that they were hard workers,

1041
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:21,270
they said that they were good.

1042
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:22,940
But your letters?

1043
00:50:22,950 --> 00:50:24,950
They said you were great.

1044
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:27,310
They spoke of your kindness,your attention to detail.

1045
00:50:27,360 --> 00:50:31,300
They talked about how hard you try and that you never give up.

1046
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:35,470
They painted a picture of the kind of doctor that I hope to become.

1047
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:39,040
It was an honor to read those letters because now I know that

1048
00:50:39,090 --> 00:50:42,570
what separates you from the others isn't one stupid point.

1049
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,480
What separates you from the others is greatness.

1050
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,380
So don't you dare let one point hold you back.

1051
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,340
Okay,I'm covered in blood.

1052
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:04,200
Talk fast.

1053
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:05,320
Alex brought rebecca in.

1054
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:06,500
She tried to hurt herself.

1055
00:51:06,510 --> 00:51:08,670
And now he's talking about taking rebecca home.

1056
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:09,600
And?

1057
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:10,730
She needs to be admitted.

1058
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,130
She needs a psych consult.

1059
00:51:12,140 --> 00:51:13,910
- And?
- Can you just do your job?

1060
00:51:14,650 --> 00:51:16,090
I am doing my job.

1061
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:16,780
- I'm sorry.
- I'm helping

1062
00:51:16,790 --> 00:51:20,490
a 19-year-old man that I promised would get to live get to live.

1063
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:22,060
That's my job as a surgeon.

1064
00:51:22,150 --> 00:51:24,200
I took my son to day care when I came in.

1065
00:51:24,210 --> 00:51:25,240
That's my job as a mother.

1066
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:29,140
And I'm standingere asking you,what are you going to do about your patient?

1067
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,460
That's my job as chief resident.

1068
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,410
Now w about you do your job?

1069
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,760
- I can'T.
- I don't know what to do.

1070
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,870
Stevens.

1071
00:51:35,930 --> 00:51:37,530
She's your patient.

1072
00:51:37,590 --> 00:51:39,170
He'S.

1073
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:40,730
her loved one.

1074
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,120
Come on,you know what to do.

1075
00:51:42,150 --> 00:51:44,380
It's just hard to do it.

1076
00:51:46,060 --> 00:51:47,100
Okay,I'll try.

1077
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:48,380
No,you don't have to try.

1078
00:51:48,410 --> 00:51:51,930
You're a doctor trained by me,with all the skills that god gave you.

1079
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:54,210
You have everything you need.

1080
00:51:59,030 --> 00:52:00,940
Each one teach one.

1081
00:52:02,630 --> 00:52:03,440
Where are we?

1082
00:52:03,550 --> 00:52:05,700
Sloan,hahn and torres are done.We're up.

1083
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:07,200
We just unclamped the portal vein.

1084
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,960
Blood flow is good to the liver.

1085
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,540
Uh,right,chief?

1086
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:11,660
Absolutely right.

1087
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,100
Good job.

1088
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,050
good,then we're ready to...

1089
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:32,470
I think I liked it better when you
were saying boring science stuff.

1090
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:39,650
I'm never good enough.

1091
00:52:40,210 --> 00:52:43,670
no matter what I say or what I do.

1092
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,390
I never wanted to do this.

1093
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:52,100
This clinical trial
is making me a failure.

1094
00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:56,570
I fail her over.

1095
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,460
and over.

1096
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,900
and over.

1097
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,970
You mean "them."

1098
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:11,620
When you say,"fail her,"
you mean "fail them".

1099
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,280
the patients.

1100
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:29,850
he's gonna need an embolectomy.

1101
00:53:29,950 --> 00:53:31,200
Call hahn back here.

1102
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:33,390
A clot in the right pulmonary
artery. It's pretty massive.

1103
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:34,470
I could get to it with a thoracotomy.

1104
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:37,300
-Uh,hahn will assess him when she gets here.
-I can get to it.

1105
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:40,330
The lung automatically retracts,leaving
the area for embolectomy clear.

1106
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:41,940
He's already severely compromised.

1107
00:53:42,030 --> 00:53:45,440
We'd waste time setting up bypass,time
his brain won't be perfusing.

1108
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,070
It'll take me seconds.

1109
00:53:47,170 --> 00:53:49,930
I've done it before. with burke.

1110
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:54,230
I promised this kid he would live.

1111
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,060
dr.Bailey,take over C.P.R.

1112
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:01,360
Yang. I'm right here if you need me.

1113
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,780
10-blade.

1114
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:25,320
you don't have to do this.

1115
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:29,920
-Come on. What are you,scared?
-Yes.

1116
00:54:32,090 --> 00:54:34,080
Me,too.

1117
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:37,350
So let's just. leap.

1118
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,580
Okay?

1119
00:54:40,870 --> 00:54:42,960
Okay.

1120
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:56,950
-what is it? What happened?
-He threw a P.E.

1121
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,630
So what,you decided yang would
be the best person to open him up?

1122
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,820
She's a bit of a cardiac
savant if you haven't noticed.

1123
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:05,020
Oh,really? Is that why she went through the
fourth istercoal space insteaof the fifth?

1124
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:06,040
Couldn't get in through the fifth

1125
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:08,710
because there's gauze pushing up the
diaphragm from the abdominal surgery.

1126
00:55:08,810 --> 00:55:10,930
This could be easier if
you did it under fluoro.

1127
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,250
Already had the T.E.E. Here.
I'm doing just fine with it.

1128
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,770
But you could reach it better if...all
right,forget it. I'll do it myself.

1129
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:16,940
-Gown,please.
-I've got this.

1130
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:20,330
No,if you had done it...
just shut up and let me work.

1131
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,810
Let her work,dr.Hahn.

1132
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:40,930
Shepherd scheduled two craniotomies
for the clinical trial today?

1133
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,190
Yes,we lost the first
one,but the second one.

1134
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:47,550
-I told meredith one patient.
-Dr.Grey said she cleared it with you.

1135
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,840
Did she?

1136
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:51,430
I.

1137
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,110
sir,I might be mistaken.

1138
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:57,270
I don't think you are.

1139
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:02,560
she's holding steady.

1140
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,090
The I.C.P.'S 13.

1141
00:56:05,170 --> 00:56:06,670
We'll see.

1142
00:56:06,750 --> 00:56:08,480
Derek.

1143
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:10,310
she's still alive.

1144
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,340
We've gotten this far.

1145
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:13,860
She's still alive.

1146
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,190
For how long?

1147
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,460
-You can go.
-I'll stay with her.

1148
00:56:19,490 --> 00:56:21,440
No,it's just.

1149
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,710
I'll do it. You can go.

1150
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:46,530
yang flew solo,and you
should be celebrating

1151
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,150
because that means
you're doing your job...

1152
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:52,550
teaching her how to save a life.

1153
00:56:52,860 --> 00:56:54,970
Residents are like.

1154
00:56:55,070 --> 00:57:02,600
puppies,eager d enthusiastic, and you need to
learn how to teach without crushing their spirit.

1155
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:06,000
Now you want to work
here with my residents,

1156
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,010
then you need to do better.

1157
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:11,860
You need to be a better teacher.

1158
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:29,270
don't make me regret backing you up.

1159
00:57:29,350 --> 00:57:31,800
No,sir. Absolutely not,sir.

1160
00:57:31,820 --> 00:57:33,630
Thank you,sir.

1161
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:35,830
Puppies.

1162
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:43,490
Rebecca.

1163
00:57:43,590 --> 00:57:46,730
this is dr.Shapiro from psych.
He's gonna be examining you.

1164
00:57:46,770 --> 00:57:51,120
Iz... he's gonna ask you a few questions
while dr.Karev and I talk. Alex?

1165
00:58:03,180 --> 00:58:05,150
-What did I tell you?
-She's my patient.

1166
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:06,560
I decide her treatment plan.

1167
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,580
I am not releasing
her without a consult.

1168
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,090
If you try to take her out of
this hospital without my okay,

1169
00:58:11,240 --> 00:58:12,710
I will call the police
and have you arrested.

1170
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:15,060
-You can't have me arrested.
-Try me.

1171
00:58:15,070 --> 00:58:18,480
Look,iz,you're worried. I
see that,and I understand.

1172
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,930
But you're...you're being
a little unreasonable.

1173
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:24,360
-I've got this.
-No,you don't have it. I have it.

1174
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:27,450
-I'm taking her home.
-No. No!

1175
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:29,370
What,are you gonna bodily restrain me?

1176
00:58:29,490 --> 00:58:30,980
I will if I have to. Are
you gonna hit a woman?

1177
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:34,560
-I will if I have to.
-Alex,she's sick.

1178
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:36,550
She needs help you
cannot possibly give her.

1179
00:58:36,660 --> 00:58:37,610
I can take care of her.

1180
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:40,080
No,you can'T. You have
no idea what you're doing.

1181
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:42,170
You could do more damage
by taking her home.

1182
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,520
Look,I can take care of
her. I've done this before.

1183
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:47,380
Alex... she's just going
through a bad patch.

1184
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,590
People go through a
bad patch. All right?

1185
00:58:49,630 --> 00:58:51,840
I. I-I-I can feed
her and I can...

1186
00:58:51,870 --> 00:58:54,320
I can change her and I can
bathe her and I can watch her.

1187
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:57,910
Until the bad patch is
over,I can take care of her.

1188
00:58:58,050 --> 00:59:02,220
Look,I took care of my
mom,and I can take care of her.

1189
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,150
-You've done this before.
-I've done this before.

1190
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,870
I have done this before,izzie.

1191
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:11,810
But I was a kid then,and I'm a
man now,so I'll be better at it.

1192
00:59:11,890 --> 00:59:14,510
-I have done this before.
-Stop.

1193
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:18,560
You don't have to say anymore.

1194
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,510
You're here early.

1195
01:00:05,650 --> 01:00:06,600
I never went home.

1196
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:10,560
I knew you'd want to monitor your patient.
And I figured you were tired after surgery,so.

1197
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:11,750
How is he?

1198
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,060
His vitals are stable.

1199
01:00:13,180 --> 01:00:15,980
He received 16 liters
over the first 24 hours.

1200
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:19,140
I changed it down to 125 cc's per hour.

1201
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:21,910
His urine output's good
at 37 cc's per hour.

1202
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,820
He had some anxiety at 3:00 A.M.,

1203
01:00:23,900 --> 01:00:27,450
And then again at 5:00 A.M. ,Which
I treated with diphenhydramine.

1204
01:00:27,450 --> 01:00:29,880
Yeah,good. Good job.

1205
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32,370
it's not a good job.

1206
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:35,960
O'malley?

1207
01:00:36,220 --> 01:00:39,430
It's not a good job for me.

1208
01:00:39,620 --> 01:00:46,500
Sitting by his bedside recording urine
output and giving antianxiety meds all night.

1209
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,370
it's not a good job for me.

1210
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:52,260
Running labs for meredith
grey,that's not a good job for me.

1211
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:56,560
It's not a good job for me because I'm better
than that, and you know I'm better than that.

1212
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:04,710
Maybe if I wasn't good at my job or maybe
if I had struggled and was lagging behind.

1213
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:09,120
my personality... I'm not karev,I'm
not yang,I'm not meredith...

1214
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,120
I'm not hardened,I get that. I get it.

1215
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:16,310
I don't have the
personality of a surgeon.

1216
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:20,800
Maybe that's why you made
the mistake of not thinking

1217
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,430
that I deserve a second chance when
everyone else around here has gotten one,

1218
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:28,670
but,sir,it is a mistake
because I'm excellent.

1219
01:01:28,770 --> 01:01:30,400
I'm excellent at my job.

1220
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:36,440
And I did fail my test,but
I deserve a second chance.

1221
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:43,730
Okay.

1222
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:47,100
Ok ?

1223
01:01:47,180 --> 01:01:50,380
Okay,you can retake the test.

1224
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,260
okay.

1225
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:01,140
She hasn't woken up yet.

1226
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:06,220
Sometimes it takes longer with brain
surgery for the body to recover.

1227
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:09,120
But she could not wake up?

1228
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,910
Could she die?

1229
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:15,080
That's a possibility,but I'd rather
not worry about that until we have to.

1230
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:16,490
When?

1231
01:02:16,580 --> 01:02:18,760
When what?

1232
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:23,430
When will we. have to
start worrying about that?

1233
01:02:37,370 --> 01:02:40,130
You're still here. What,did
you sleep in the waiting room?

1234
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:43,220
Look,I like him. All right,I do.

1235
01:02:43,320 --> 01:02:46,100
But he doesn't need to know
that. Nobody needs to know that.

1236
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:49,210
He needs you,and you're too worried
about what your friends think?

1237
01:02:49,310 --> 01:02:50,700
What do you know about it?

1238
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:54,080
Do you know what it'd be like
for me,for him,if they knew?

1239
01:02:54,180 --> 01:02:57,140
You think it's easy?

1240
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:02,250
I think it's better to be honest.

1241
01:03:03,760 --> 01:03:05,080
He's alive.

1242
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,370
Barely,but.

1243
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:10,070
he's alive.

1244
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:20,090
I,uh,called your husband.

1245
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:24,840
He says he took the baby
and left you two months ago.

1246
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,660
He says.

1247
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:42,750
you have something called underlying
borderline personality disorder,

1248
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:46,270
which means you were fragile
to start with,so this.

1249
01:03:46,330 --> 01:03:49,690
this has probably been
coming on for a while.

1250
01:03:49,770 --> 01:03:53,290
Probably since your... your accident.

1251
01:03:53,400 --> 01:03:56,530
When they change your face.

1252
01:03:57,270 --> 01:04:00,500
I helped change yourace.

1253
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:02,890
you couldn'T.

1254
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:11,390
you need help,rebecca,and
I can't give it to you.

1255
01:04:14,340 --> 01:04:18,770
So you're gonna stay
here tonight,and tomorrow.

1256
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:25,390
tomorrow,they're gonna transfer
you to a psychiatric facility.

1257
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:29,380
I think that's better.

1258
01:04:30,460 --> 01:04:33,020
I'm sorry.

1259
01:04:37,340 --> 01:04:39,440
I. I really tried.

1260
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:44,550
I wanted to be better for you.

1261
01:04:46,580 --> 01:04:52,720
I know how hard it is for you to trust people,
and I wanted to be someone you could depend on.

1262
01:04:53,920 --> 01:04:56,300
I'm sorry.

1263
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:01,080
I'm sorry.

1264
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:06,300
It's okay. You tried.

1265
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:15,380
So you convinced shepherd to do the
second surgery without my approval.

1266
01:05:15,470 --> 01:05:18,090
-So?
-So?

1267
01:05:19,620 --> 01:05:23,760
That's how you speak to the chief,"so"?

1268
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:27,200
My mother tried to kill
herself after you left.

1269
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:30,280
Did you know that?

1270
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:33,880
Did you know that?

1271
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:36,470
I didn't know that. I'm
sorry. I didn't know.

1272
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:39,430
I... she was a brilliant surgeon.

1273
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:43,130
How could you do that to her?

1274
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:49,550
She was a
talented,gifted,extraordinary surgeon.

1275
01:05:52,660 --> 01:05:55,280
Meredith?

1276
01:06:02,890 --> 01:06:04,160
Tell me.

1277
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:05,510
She was a surgeon.

1278
01:06:05,610 --> 01:06:07,300
She was an excellent surgeon.

1279
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:10,580
If she was really trying to kill
herself,she wouldn't have slit her wrists.

1280
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:14,550
She knew better. She would've taken
the scalpel and cut her carotid artery.

1281
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,670
It would've taken seconds to die.

1282
01:06:16,750 --> 01:06:18,220
She didn't really want to die.

1283
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:21,020
She was an
excellent,gifted,extraordinary surgeon.

1284
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,780
She didn't want to die.

1285
01:06:22,860 --> 01:06:23,560
What did she want?

1286
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:25,380
She wanted richard to come back to her.

1287
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:27,110
And why didn't he come back?

1288
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:32,110
Well,because. he never knew about
it,and she was too stubborn to ask.

1289
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,230
What does that mean?

1290
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:38,320
Well. that part I don't know. Could
you just tell me that part for once?

1291
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,880
I can.

1292
01:06:40,220 --> 01:06:46,180
It means that you are a gifted,talented,extraordinary
surgeon,exactly like your mother,

1293
01:06:46,260 --> 01:06:51,950
but the difference is,you get
to learn from her mistakes.

1294
01:06:54,080 --> 01:06:56,780
Be extraordinary.

1295
01:06:59,070 --> 01:07:01,980
She wasn't talking about surgery.

1296
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:04,750
No,she wasn'T.

1297
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:10,210
She wasn't talking about surgery at all.

1298
01:07:19,430 --> 01:07:23,330
Well,do I or do I not keep my promises?

1299
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:27,050
You do.

1300
01:07:27,790 --> 01:07:32,040
And remember what I said
about the bigger picture?

1301
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:34,580
yeah.

1302
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,800
he's been waiting his
whole life for that,huh?

1303
01:08:06,910 --> 01:08:09,490
Yes,he has.

1304
01:08:20,820 --> 01:08:22,600
I know you have two balls.

1305
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:25,560
And you better hope I
never tell the chief.

1306
01:08:29,620 --> 01:08:31,700
Alex?

1307
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:33,210
Hey.

1308
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:35,900
Are you okay?

1309
01:08:49,090 --> 01:08:50,920
-are those beth's films?
-Yes.

1310
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,230
These are from two days
ago,and these are from today.

1311
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:57,020
Would you hand me the calipers,please?

1312
01:09:04,250 --> 01:09:06,320
This one is smaller than that one.

1313
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:08,230
The tumor's shrinking.
The virus is working.

1314
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:09,790
Oh,my god.

1315
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,750
-you have to go tell derek.
-No.

1316
01:09:14,410 --> 01:09:16,150
You have to tell derek.

1317
01:09:16,230 --> 01:09:19,870
It's the kind of news
he'd want to hear from you.

1318
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:22,700
Rose.

1319
01:09:23,320 --> 01:09:27,350
congratulations on your
major medical breakthrough.

1320
01:09:27,630 --> 01:09:30,650
It's the stuff of legends.

1321
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:39,560
Oh,you gotta take this
sparkle pager back.

1322
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,440
I am drunk on the power.

1323
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:43,970
-Where is it?
-I think it might actually be mystical.

1324
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,970
-Have you seen derek?
-Nope.

1325
01:09:49,130 --> 01:09:52,550
um,you paged,dr.Yang?

1326
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:56,210
Grab that banana from my cubby.

1327
01:09:58,300 --> 01:10:00,670
You...you want me to. peel it for you?

1328
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:02,930
No,I want you to learn
the running whip stitch.

1329
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:05,970
I'm gonna teach it to
you. Take the needle.

1330
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:07,950
Chart,please.

1331
01:10:08,030 --> 01:10:09,720
Thank you.

1332
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:31,590
hi.

1333
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:37,930
Hey.

1334
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:40,860
You're alive.

1335
01:10:43,930 --> 01:10:47,060
Yeah. I'm alive.

1336
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:01,760
Not just for show anymore.

1337
01:11:03,370 --> 01:11:05,420
No.

1338
01:11:21,370 --> 01:11:24,290
that's not sanitary.

1339
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:27,590
Uh,a little closer together. Try again.

1340
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:30,860
Dr.Yang,thank you for... uh-huh.

1341
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:40,220
How'd it go?

1342
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:43,880
Awful.

1343
01:11:43,980 --> 01:11:45,810
yeah.

1344
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:54,260
Okay,um.

1345
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:56,940
th...uh,these are for you.

1346
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:58,220
Why are you giving me
your keys to the clinic?

1347
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:02,790
I'm not giving you my keys to the
clinic. I'm giving you the clinic.

1348
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:04,590
What?

1349
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:07,360
I've seen the bigger picture.

1350
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,310
I love the clinic. I love what
it means,I love what it is.

1351
01:12:11,350 --> 01:12:14,020
But I don't love it as
much as I love surgery.

1352
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:18,110
I don't love it as mh as I
love being chief resident.

1353
01:12:18,230 --> 01:12:23,180
I don't love it as much as I
love. my husband and my child.

1354
01:12:23,230 --> 01:12:30,850
I have seen the bigger picture,and I can't
do everything and still have everything.

1355
01:12:30,930 --> 01:12:33,430
So I have to,uh.

1356
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,180
let some pieces go.

1357
01:12:36,260 --> 01:12:39,340
This piece.

1358
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:41,260
This is your piece.

1359
01:12:41,380 --> 01:12:48,470
I've watched you earn this
piece the hard way,the awful way.

1360
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:51,270
Knowing.

1361
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:53,950
that I can give the
clinic to someone like you.

1362
01:12:54,050 --> 01:12:56,970
you have grown.

1363
01:12:57,210 --> 01:13:01,800
into a fine doctor,izzie stevens.

1364
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:07,030
Thank you.

1365
01:13:13,820 --> 01:13:17,900
The denny duquette memorial
clinic is in your hands.

1366
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,140
You make me proud.

1367
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:30,840
Derek!

1368
01:13:30,940 --> 01:13:33,230
He's not there.

1369
01:13:42,390 --> 01:13:44,790
I'm not a bad man.

1370
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:50,940
I know I'm the villain in your
story,but I'm not a bad man.

1371
01:13:57,820 --> 01:14:00,790
So you want to finish
what we started yesterday?

1372
01:14:00,890 --> 01:14:04,110
Or you can finish what you started.

1373
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,130
I'm growing.

1374
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:16,790
Go. Get outta here.

1375
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:29,060
Hey.

1376
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,600
I wanted to see if you
wanted to grab a drink.

1377
01:14:31,670 --> 01:14:34,780
-I find my keys.
-Maybe we could,um.

1378
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:38,080
I had something I wanted
to talk to you about.

1379
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:39,650
I had the damn keys this morning.

1380
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:42,110
I put them in this
bag,but I can't remember...

1381
01:14:42,180 --> 01:14:45,660
-this whole thing with yang has got me so messed up.
-Erica.

1382
01:14:45,870 --> 01:14:47,620
What?

1383
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,540
I'm saying something.

1384
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:57,730
I just... I wanted to say.

1385
01:15:00,920 --> 01:15:03,010
I just wanted to say.

1386
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,640
meredith!

1387
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:19,640
richard?

1388
01:15:19,740 --> 01:15:21,420
I want to come home.

1389
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:23,790
Richard... look,I am a good man.

1390
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,550
I'm a good man.

1391
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:31,050
Look,I spend my days being a good man for
the hospital,for my residents,for my patients.

1392
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:34,760
I'm a good man who made one
mistake with a woman 20 years ago.

1393
01:15:34,890 --> 01:15:38,650
I am a good man for everybody
but you. I know that.

1394
01:15:38,750 --> 01:15:41,020
Don't you think I know that?

1395
01:15:41,120 --> 01:15:43,080
But I am a good man.

1396
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:45,950
and I am your husband.

1397
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:49,030
and I love you.

1398
01:15:49,350 --> 01:15:53,800
Now I am not asking you to come home.

1399
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,240
I'm telling you.

1400
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:02,070
I am your husband,and I
want to come home to my wife.

1401
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:11,870
well.

1402
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:15,760
it's about time.

1403
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,110
Meredith.

1404
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:33,400
-I'm retaking my intern test.
-Oh,my god.

1405
01:16:33,410 --> 01:16:36,220
I talked to the chief and made
my case,and I'm taking the test.

1406
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:39,520
Lexie,I know I was mad before,but
thank you,thank you,thank you.

1407
01:16:40,120 --> 01:16:41,220
Thank you.

1408
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:44,640
Get out the liquor,'cause
we are celebrating.

1409
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,730
-I'm sorry.
-Whatever.

1410
01:17:09,240 --> 01:17:11,380
Not whatever.

1411
01:17:11,450 --> 01:17:13,180
I'm sorry.

1412
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:17,710
about rebecca and your mom.

1413
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,470
I'm sorry.

1414
01:17:28,350 --> 01:17:30,990
-Alex.
-please.

1415
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:34,170
Just this once.

1416
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:37,080
Just for this one night,please.

1417
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,610
please.

1418
01:18:07,390 --> 01:18:12,560
please.

1419
01:18:14,240 --> 01:18:16,330
Please.

1420
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:32,310
hey,we goin' home.

1421
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:37,040
Oh,home to daddy.

1422
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,940
Yeah. Yeah.

1423
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:45,270
Meredith?

1424
01:18:58,030 --> 01:19:02,030
brain ma. corny. idiotic.
I cannot believe I did this.

1425
01:19:02,100 --> 01:19:03,300
stupid loser.

1426
01:19:03,390 --> 01:19:04,600
son of A.

1427
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:07,260
I could be at home instead of.

1428
01:19:07,470 --> 01:19:09,790
-Stupid.
-meredith.

1429
01:19:09,980 --> 01:19:11,280
Where have you been?

1430
01:19:11,400 --> 01:19:13,270
I've been waiting and waiting for you,

1431
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:16,980
and I did this
stupid,embarrassing,humiliating,corny thing,

1432
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:19,610
and I was just gonna tell
you that this over here

1433
01:19:19,710 --> 01:19:23,560
is our kitchen and
this is our living room,

1434
01:19:23,660 --> 01:19:26,430
and over there,that's the
room where our kids could play.

1435
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:28,630
I had this whole thing about
"I was gonna build us a house,"

1436
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:30,780
but I don't build houses
because I'm a surgeon.

1437
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:34,610
And now I'm here feeling
like a lame-ass loser.

1438
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:39,480
I got all whole and
healed,and you don't show up.

1439
01:19:39,560 --> 01:19:41,860
And now it's all ruined because
you took so long to come home.

1440
01:19:41,990 --> 01:19:45,450
And I couldn't even find
that bottle of champagne.

1441
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:55,390
This is the kitchen?

1442
01:19:55,750 --> 01:19:57,850
Living room?

1443
01:19:58,790 --> 01:20:00,820
Little small.

1444
01:20:00,920 --> 01:20:03,520
I think the view is
much better from here.

1445
01:20:03,610 --> 01:20:06,410
And that's the room where
the kids are gonna play?

1446
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,610
Where's our bedroom?

1447
01:20:14,330 --> 01:20:17,720
I'm still mad at you,and i
don't know if I trust you.

1448
01:20:17,830 --> 01:20:19,410
I want to trust you,but
I don't know if I do.

1449
01:20:19,530 --> 01:20:20,500
So I'm just gonna try.

1450
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:22,770
I'm gonna try and trust
you because I believe that

1451
01:20:22,850 --> 01:20:28,720
we can be extraordinary together rather
than ordinary apart and I wanna be.

1452
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:56,180
-I have to go.
-What?

1453
01:20:56,230 --> 01:20:59,430
In order to kiss you the
way I want to kiss you,

1454
01:20:59,620 --> 01:21:05,460
in order to do more than kiss
you,I need to speak to rose.

1455
01:21:05,540 --> 01:21:12,190
I want my conscience clear so
that I can do more than kiss you.

1456
01:21:13,530 --> 01:21:16,250
Stay here.

1457
01:21:16,420 --> 01:21:18,670
Don't move.

1458
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:21,920
Wait for me.
