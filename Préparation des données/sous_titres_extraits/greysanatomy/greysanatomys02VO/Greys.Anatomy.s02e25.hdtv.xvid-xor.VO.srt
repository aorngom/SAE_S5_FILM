1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,110
Previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,380
I didn't get the heart.

3
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,270
You didn't get the heart.

4
00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:04,800
I cannot fall for a patient.

5
00:00:04,850 --> 00:00:06,770
what's goin' on between stevens and denny?

6
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:09,370
Is it a crush,is it an innocent flirtation,

7
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:11,160
or is stevens actually crossing the line?

8
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:14,610
I'm considering the possibility
of maybe having a date with a vet.

9
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:15,830
Is he sick again?

10
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,780
I got home. He was listless
and hadn't eaten all day.

11
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:20,760
Those girls were staring at me
like I was a rodent or something.

12
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,300
I'm a surgeon first,just like you.

13
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:25,090
No,not just like me.
I am a person first.

14
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,220
If burke can forgive me
for falling asleep during sex--

15
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:28,570
burke hasn't forgiven you.

16
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,390
You left me. 
You don't get to call me a whore.

17
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:35,770
This thing with us is finished. 
It's over.

18
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,020
in life,we are taught that
there are seven deadly sins.

19
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,390
All right,let's see what you got here.

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:42,890
We all know the big ones--

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,200
gluttony,pride,lust...

22
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:48,080
he's picturing my face.

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,910
He's totally picturing that
dart puncturing my skull.

24
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,030
But the sin you don't hear
much about is anger.

25
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,470
Oh,look at that.

26
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:01,610
Maybe it's because
we think anger's not that dangerous...

27
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:04,970
derek--
derek is picturing you.

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,680
That we can control it...

29
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,820
he called me a whore.
He lost the right to picture me.

30
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,530
So I fell asleep during sex--

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,010
so what?

32
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:14,970
Ass!

33
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:16,500
Ass!

34
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,950
Oh,ass! Hey.

35
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,540
Well,well,isobel stevens
has finally left the hospital.

36
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,710
Does this mean heart patient
dude finally kicked it?

37
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,620
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:27,680
This section of the bar is for surgeons.

39
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:30,900
We don't socialize with gynecologists.

40
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,300
george!Hi.

41
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:39,760
My point is,
maybe we don't give anger enough credit

42
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:40,760
-Hey.
-Hi,callie.

43
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,360
Hey,dr. Torres.

44
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,660
Maybe it can be a lot more
dangerous than we think.

45
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,570
After all,when it comes to
destructive behavior...

46
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,070
gin and tonic and a beer.

47
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:54,280
It did make the top seven.

48
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:58,200
That's it?

49
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,700
That's your diagnosis?

50
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:02,220
Yes,he said bone cancer,
so that would be his diagnosis

51
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,410
I heard him.
I was double-checking.

52
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,850
I still need to do a bone scan
to see how far it's spread.

53
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,860
Osteosarcomas are aggressive,

54
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,550
but,uh,we can try and treat it with chemo
or remove the tumor entirely.

55
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,910
If it's spread too far,
we may have to amputate the limb.

56
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:20,680
At that point,should we even bother?

57
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,680
oh,right,let's just let him die.

58
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,140
-I don't want him to suffer,meredith.
-Right.

59
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:32,490
so what's--I mean,
is there something going on?

60
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,880
No.
No.

61
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,130
Did you guys have a fight or something?

62
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:37,550
No.
No.

63
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,850
So... 
we're all still...friends?

64
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,520
Yes.
Yes.

65
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:54,920
I heard you might
be getting a heart for a transplant.

66
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,990
Mercy west has a heart,
and I'm going to get it,yes.

67
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,700
Can I go? 'Cause,
um,I've done it before...

68
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:04,200
with dr. Bailey
when she went to get a heart

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,070
You can ask her.
I was very helpful.

70
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,730
Oh,I'm sure you were,

71
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,570
but I'm not going to
need your help on this one

72
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,070
22-year-old white male.
G.S.W. To the left shoulder.

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,470
three dead on scene,
multiple walking wounded.

74
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,440
Five most injured are coming in behind us.
We're gonna need...

75
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,540
why are they all in the hallway?

76
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,340
Overflow from the E.R.

77
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,040
Paramedic told us some employee
went postal,shot up a restaurant.

78
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,340
I heard he got away.

79
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,560
Really?

80
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,800
Neal hannigan and deborah fleiss.

81
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,530
They were paying at the register
when the gunman came in.

82
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,540
She's got a through and through
to the right upper arm.

83
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,990
Good distal pulses.

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,630
He sustained a possible graze wound
to the right back.

85
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,140
Let's irrigate the wound,

86
00:03:39,210 --> 00:03:42,260
get them to x-ray
and order a tet-tox for both

87
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,260
Don't worry about me.
Take care of my deborah first.

88
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,910
Oh,now you're concerned.

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,460
I said I was sorry.

90
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,740
Sorry?

91
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,020
The shooting starts and you duck behind me,
and you're sorry?

92
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,180
He ducked behind--you ducked behind her?

93
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,340
It was instinct.
I couldn't help it.

94
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,310
Deb,honey,you know I love you.

95
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,150
Love means never having to
use your girlfriend as a human shield.

96
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,180
we shared a bullet.

97
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,230
Deborah,it went through you and into me.

98
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,830
That's a sign we should be
together forever,a sign.

99
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,520
No,neal,this is a sign.

100
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,490
She is squirting water through my arm.

101
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,850
Look. I can see you through my arm.

102
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:13,730
That's another sign.

103
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,960
Good luck.

104
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,630
Lower left leg deformity from G.S.W.

105
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,600
Pedal pulse is strong and intact.

106
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,740
Paramedic said he got 5
of morphine in the field.

107
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,070
Oh,trust me.
It was not enough.

108
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,130
Probably got the tibia.

109
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,820
Rule out other injuries
and then get him up to radiology

110
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,390
Let's get her up to C.T.

111
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,520
Get ahold of her parents and
get 'em down here as soon as possible

112
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,730
What's her name,by the way?

113
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,830
kendra.
Kendra thomas.

114
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,750
Kendra.

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,850
almost got it.

116
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:44,620
Ohh! Do you know what you're doing?

117
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,450
Because that really hurts,you know?

118
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,960
You know what really hurts?

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,450
Gunshot wounds.

120
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,610
You're lucky.

121
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,190
Lucky? There's no luck.
Quick thinking,doll.

122
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,560
Excuse me?

123
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,040
I'm a quick thinker,smart,
always right on it.

124
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,830
As soon as I saw him--
petey--he's the shooter...

125
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,200
hey,I knew when I fired him he was no good.

126
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,510
As soon as I saw him,
I thought,oh,here we go.

127
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:06,400
I just knew what was coming.

128
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,070
Hey,chaz,larry,no offense,

129
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,420
but you guys gotta think quicker
on your feet.

130
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,670
they have gunshot wounds,
very serious gunshot wounds,

131
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,950
life-threatening gunshot wounds.

132
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,120
It really helps that I'm an athlete,

133
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,180
'cause the second
I saw petey with that gun

134
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,610
I was,like,cat-quick,
just dove right through the window

135
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,340
Those guys... not so smart.

136
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:33,340
I'm gonna take a wild guess
and say that petey was looking for you

137
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,980
You seen any enema kits?

138
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,610
We have 13 G.S.W.S.
You're looking for enema kits?

139
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:43,430
I'm trapped upstairs with the gyno-beast
on the uterus parade.

140
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,480
Addison can't do this to you forever,alex.

141
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,450
You wanna bet?

142
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,460
I swear to god,
she's ruining vaginas for me

143
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,400
2 dead,14 injured.

144
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,300
The policeman said the gunman got away,
so there could be more incoming.

145
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,740
I could stay.

146
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:57,650
We could send bailey.

147
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,620
No,no.

148
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,150
You're our only cardiothoracic
transplant specialist.

149
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,490
You go get that heart.

150
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,350
Oh,forget it,karev.
I already asked.

151
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,170
It's not gonna... 
happen.

152
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,760
dr. Burke!

153
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,530
Dr. Burke!

154
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,050
I heard you were getting a heart.

155
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:21,350
-Can I go with you?
-I asked first.

156
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:24,230
You didn't get assigned any gunshot cases?

157
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,610
Well,yeah,but if you had put me on this
when I asked,I would've been free

158
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,670
-I didn'T.I'm not doing anything.
-No,he's on the gynie squad

159
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,880
Not if you put me on this transplant.

160
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,030
Please!

161
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,840
-Let's go,karev.
-You can't be serious.

162
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,700
Whoo! See you later,yang.

163
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,450
Whoo!

164
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:51,530
So who's the lucky patient?

165
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,900
Denny duquette.

The answer is no,stevens.

170
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,220
You don't even know what I'm gonna ask.

171
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,960
You want to help
prep denny duquette for transplant

172
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,300
So it's true?
He's getting a heart then?

173
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,960
See,your face right now?

174
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,180
That's the problem.

175
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,700
You're overly attached to your patient.

176
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:35,150
So the answer is no,
you cannot prep him.

177
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,470
Go back to sutures.

178
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:39,880
I know denny's cardiac parameters.

179
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,430
I know how his lvad works better
than any other intern.

180
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,920
I also know his meds better.

181
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:47,980
I know the frequency,the dosage,
the quantity and his physical limitations

182
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,310
I promise,I will--
I will be 100% professional

183
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:55,240
Oh,no flirting,no knitting him sweaters,
no marathon games of scrabble?

184
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,850
I will treat him with the same protocol
I would any other patient.

185
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,970
All right,fine.

186
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,250
You can inform him the heart's coming.

187
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,090
-Thank you,dr. Bailey.thank you.
-Stevens...

188
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:10,140
-You so much as sit on that bed--
-got it!

189
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,850
Can you imagine?

190
00:08:18,910 --> 00:08:22,550
You're at work,you're doing your job,
and somebody comes in and shoots you,

191
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:25,220
just puts a bullet in your head.
19 years old.

192
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,200
I called her parents.
They're on their way,also--

193
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,920
good,'cause we need to get her
into the O.R. Immediately.

194
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,360
I mean,the bullet's gone
right through the midline

195
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,180
Also,uh...look at the size of the hematoma.

196
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,340
-Also?
-What?

197
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,070
You said "also" twice.

198
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,860
Yeah,also,she's pregnant.

199
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:45,070
yeah,I'm management,
so I'm 100% covered.

200
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,320
So I could spend a year in this hospital,
it wouldn't cost me a cent.

201
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,830
That's why when I told you 
about management,chaz,

202
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,810
you should've listened to me,
'cause now,you're screwed.

203
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,760
I mean,
even if you just spend one day in this E.R.

204
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,330
That's three...months rent.

205
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,820
You want to be a 60-year-old waiter?

206
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:02,260
Is there any chance you can
please up my morphine?

207
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,640
if he keeps talking,pretty soon,
I'm gonna need some.

208
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,380
Can you find out about kendra for me?

209
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,240
Are you two friends?

210
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,420
Not friends,exactly.

211
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:14,080
But,uh,everybody likes her,you know?

212
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:17,280
She's--she's just--she's nice.

213
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,800
She'll cover your shift when you need it,

214
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,580
she's good with the customers,

215
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,910
she's real generous
when it comes to tipping busboys

216
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,690
-Let me guess,you're a busboy
-I am.

217
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,750
Plus,she's the only one
who calls brad on his crap

218
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,410
Well,why don't you say something?

219
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:33,820
Yeah,I wish. 
I'm saving up to go back to school

220
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,970
I need the job.

221
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,130
What,are you socializing?

222
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,770
I've got five more patients for you to see,

223
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,700
and will here needs to get to surgery.

224
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:42,400
Move your ass.

225
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,610
I need the job.

226
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,610
I have some news for you.

227
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,210
Am I getting a better television?

228
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,320
'Cause this one is ridiculously small,

229
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,070
and it doesn't get the porny channels.

230
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:59,290
You're getting a heart,denny.

231
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,690
I don't mean to be dramatic and all...

232
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,620
but I'm gonna need you to repeat that.

233
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,240
And you say it slow,

234
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,740
because this is one of those moments in life

235
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,990
that I'm gonna want to remember in detail.

236
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,660
You...are getting a heart from mercy west.

237
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:24,390
Dr. Burke already left to get it.

238
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,500
I guess this means I'm gonna have to
start taking you on some real dates.

239
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,690
I guess so.

240
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:32,750
here we are,mr. Duquette.

241
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,600
-What are these?
-D.N.R. Papers.

242
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,610
Do not resuscitate?

243
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,960
I'll leave these here and come back.

244
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,550
why are you signing these?

245
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,580
You're getting a heart.

246
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,200
If this heart doesn't come through
for some reason

247
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,200
it will.

248
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:50,220
The last one didn'T.

249
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:53,180
You are on an lvad,okay?

250
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,570
That could give you another two years right there.

251
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,900
Izzie...

252
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,130
if I don't get this heart...

253
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,240
I'm done.

254
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:06,780
I'M... I'm just--I'm tired.

255
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,280
no.

256
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,630
No.I'm not gonna let you
make this decision,not now

257
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:16,630
Well,that's funny because I thought
D.N.R.Was a patient's choice.

258
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,200
Listen to me...

259
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,950
I believe in heaven,izzie.

260
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:34,290
And if I had to choose between...
this life here...

261
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:41,510
and--and one in heaven...I choose heaven.

262
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,630
Okay?

263
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,830
Okay.

264
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,490
Okay.

265
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,820
The x-rays will tell us
the location of the bullet.

266
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:59,120
Mine was a through and through,right?
So there's no bullet.

267
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,600
Yeah,well,we want to
make sure it didn't hit bone

268
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:03,880
However this turns out,
I want you to operate on my fianc first

269
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:04,870
I don't care if I'm dying.

270
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,330
You're not dying.

271
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,510
I'm also not your fianc anymore.

272
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,070
We already sent out the invitations.

273
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,340
We're getting married six weeks from now.

274
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,160
Deborah,please.

275
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,820
I love you.

276
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,230
oh,don't fall for it.

277
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:21,610
-Excuse me,but--
-that's how they do it,huh?

278
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,200
With the "I love yous"
and the "move in with mes,"

279
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,520
and they suck you in,
and he melts your resolve.

280
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,200
And the minute
you actually need something,

281
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,580
something you totally deserve,

282
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,230
oh,forget it. You know,
it's not gonna happen

283
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,850
because they're gonna pass you
over for surgery

284
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:36,420
or they're gonna duck behind you
when someone's shooting.

285
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,600
You're very,very bitter.

286
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:42,120
that's exactly what I was thinking.
See?

287
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,850
-We're meant to be together.
-Shut up,neal.

288
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,540
there are two donors?

289
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,050
Two brothers tried to
pass a semi on a double yellow

290
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,440
and came out
on the losing end of a head-on

291
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,580
Both are a match for your guy.

292
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,940
So we get our pick?

293
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,450
It doesn't work like that.

294
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,780
U.N.O.S. Has already assigned
who gets which donor.

295
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,430
so who's retrieving the other heart?

296
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,080
took you long enough,preston.

297
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,760
Why is junior here?
Your ego get too big for one man to carry?

298
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:20,440
dr. Hahn here graduated second in our class
at johns hopkins,dr. Karev.

299
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:23,170
Ask her who graduated first.

300
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,380
god.

301
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,510
kendra's fetus is 12 weeks along.

302
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,770
Seems healthy.

303
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,540
-Did you hear me,derek?
-I heard you.

304
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,430
So you're not gonna tell me
what's going on between you and meredith?

305
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,040
I told you there's nothing to tell.

306
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,760
Kendra's parents are here.

307
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,070
Let them know the situation,
sign the consent forms and then scrub in.

308
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:50,440
-Yes,dr. Shepherd.
-Thank you.

309
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:00,080
what the hell happened to my donor?

310
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,770
he went into v-fib.

311
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,510
I can see that.
Give me the paddles.

312
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,700
Karev,take over compressions.
You gave epi?

313
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,270
Three rounds.
And we shocked him twice.

314
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,430
I'm gonna hit him again at 360. Clear.

315
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,840
He's asystolic.
I don't get it.

316
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,080
The guy's already dead.

317
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,680
And now his heart has joined the rest of him.

318
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,520
So we can't use it?

319
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,390
No,karev,we cannot use it.

320
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,650
The muscle is dead.

321
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,980
The heart is useless.

322
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,550
dr. Burke.

323
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,100
Oh,my god!

324
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,670
Move,move,move,move!

325
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,180
Stop right now.

326
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,720
Don't move that scalpel,
not even a single slice.

327
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,520
Just because your donor's heart died
doesn't mean I have to give you mine.

328
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,520
Is your patient higher
on the transplant list?

329
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,820
Is he higher on the transplant list?

330
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,220
I have no idea.

331
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,420
Well,neither do I.

332
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,170
Karev,get U.N.O.S.On the phone,now.

333
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,320
Oh,give me a break.

334
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,150
Hey,hey.

335
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:07,530
What,are you gonna beat him up?

336
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,680
If I have to.

337
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:10,250
Okay,just hold on.

338
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:14,040
Pathetic,preston.
Really pathetic.

339
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,260
I finished all five of your patients.

340
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,100
Do you mind if I scrub in?
I've never seen an O.R.I.F. Before.

341
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,880
Can'T. The board's all backed up like crazy.

342
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,460
Will's gonna have to wait a few hours

343
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,430
'cause every other specialty thinks their
surgeries are more important than ortho

344
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,400
Freakin' superior,macho jerks.

345
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,960
Can I ask you a question about bone cancer?

346
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,550
Yeah.

347
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,510
-In a dog.
-A dog?

348
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:44,330
My dog.
Well,derek's dog.

349
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,300
Do you know dr. Shepherd?

350
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:50,300
It's our dog.We share the dog,
which is--well,never mind.

351
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:58,770
Ijust wantedto askyou ifou knew the success
rate of curing osteosarcoma in a canine leg

352
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:03,250
We have an actual human patient
with a-a bullet lodged in his tibia,

353
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,150
who might walk with a limp
for the rest of his life

354
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,410
who might even conceivably lose his leg,

355
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:12,200
and you're askingme about your predog
that you share with your precious mcdreamy?

356
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:13,990
Yeah,I-I know about him.

357
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,230
And you think I care?

358
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,170
Unbelievable.

359
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:22,150
your guy's on an lvad.
He's probably up and walking around

360
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,830
My guy still needs his dobutamine drip.

361
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,720
That's the best you can do?

362
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:29,670
He can climb mount shasta
on a dobutamine drip.

363
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:33,410
as of this morning,dr. Hahn's patient
was 22 hundredths of a point ahead

364
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:34,770
Well,that's basically a tie.

365
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:39,230
Except that dr.Hahn's patient was admitted
intothe transplant program beforeMrDuquette

366
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,770
How long before?

367
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:47,730
17 seconds.
17 seconds.

368
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,800
Might as well be 17 weeks.
It doesn't matter.

369
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,810
-hello.
-Alex?Where's dr. Burke?

370
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,060
What do you want?

371
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,360
I want to know
how the heart recovery is going

372
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,870
He's working on it.

373
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,730
"He's working on it"?
So he's operating now?

374
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,520
There were two donors,izzie.

375
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,280
Our guy's heart flatlined,
and now he's trying to get the other guy'S.

376
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:11,890
But there's a list.

377
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:15,120
Yes,and the higher guy gets the heart.

378
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,240
Denny's getting sicker.

379
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,400
What?

380
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:21,040
Denny's getting worse by the second.

381
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:23,220
His,uh,his sats are in the 80s.

382
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,290
Izzie.

383
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,050
70s.
His sats are now in the 70s and dropping

384
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:29,570
Izzie,I'm not gonna lie for you.

385
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,610
Then put burke on the phone.

386
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,530
-Hey.
-Hey.

387
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:38,030
Have you seen dr. Karev?

388
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,050
Uh... hours ago.

389
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,520
Okay.

390
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,630
Sorry. I,uh...
I'm--I'm not sorry.

391
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:54,490
I just--I'm having a little trouble
because I need to ask you something.

392
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,220
And I don't usually have trouble,
but what I need to ask,

393
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,180
I'm not even sure
I want the answer to.

394
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,180
But I have to ask,
so I'm just gonna ask you,

395
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:04,890
and then you answer,
and then,um...

396
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,550
and we'll go from there,okay?

397
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,810
Okay.

398
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,450
Are you sleeping with my husband?

399
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:15,730
Not since before I knew he was married.

400
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,920
Okay.

401
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,140
Except,you know,it just--

402
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,210
it felt like--

403
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:25,020
in the vet's office this morning
and then again in the elevator--

404
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,370
it felt a little like
you two were having a lovers' quarrel?

405
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,450
No,we're not.

406
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,210
I've moved on.

407
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,390
I'm dating finn.

408
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,330
You're dating the vet?

409
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,710
Okay.

410
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:47,150
-Addison...
-no,no,thanks.I'm--I'm good.

411
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,470
Thanks. I'm great.

412
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:54,020
flash pulmonary edema?

413
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,880
Is--is it the lvad?
Is the lvad working?

414
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,060
Absolutely.

415
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,600
Well,did you put him on a nitro drip?

416
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,400
Um,I... yes.
Yes,of course.

417
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:03,660
Preston,she could be
putting paddles directly on his heart

418
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,070
He's still not getting this thing.

419
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,870
How's his blood pressure?

420
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,470
It's,uh,still dropping.
82 over 40.

421
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,410
Then take him off the drip
and put him on dopamine,now

422
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:13,250
Don't hang up.

423
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,650
According to my intern,

424
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:20,110
denny duquette now qualifies
as a 1a candidate for that heart

425
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,750
That puts him ahead of dr. Hahn's patient.

426
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,390
I'm outta here.
This is just crap.

427
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,680
-dr. Hahn.
-What?

428
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,540
If dr. Burke wants to run labs,
do an echo and a B.N.P.

429
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,840
To fully ascertain the status
of his patient,we'll allow it.

430
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,500
That'll take an hour.

431
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,130
Is the donor stable?

432
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:37,530
Dr. Hahn,is the donor stable?

433
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,640
Yes,the donor is currently stable.

434
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,640
In that case,dr. Burke,
you've got an hour to get those tests

435
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,560
-Dr. Stevens.
-I heard.

436
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:48,550
Good.
Get going then.

437
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,080
B.P.'S 220 over 130.

438
00:19:58,140 --> 00:19:59,800
The brain is fungating out of the wound.

439
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,460
-What's fungating?
-Herniating.

440
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,400
she's bradycardic.

441
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,770
Let me get 50 mannitol and 20 furosemide.

442
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,030
What's her pulse?

443
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,160
Down to 32.

444
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,120
Come on,kendra. 
CO2?

445
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:14,190
40.

446
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,130
Oh,god.
The clot's already evacuated.

447
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,250
All right,everybody.

448
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,960
But--she's brain dead.

449
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:21,400
There's nothing we can do now.

450
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:26,190
There is no spontaneous brain activity,

451
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,310
and she isn't going to wake up.

452
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:29,210
Oh,god.

453
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:31,620
What about the baby?
Is the baby okay?

454
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,810
As far as we can tell,
the baby's fine,but...

455
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,050
that's not the point.

456
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,500
Essentially,your daughter is dead.

457
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:42,270
We need your consent 
To remove her from life support.

458
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,760
What if we kept kendra alive?

459
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,000
Could the baby live?

460
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:48,430
With all due respect,sir,
you don't want to do that

461
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,000
Are you part of this family?

462
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,470
Do you have a daughter?

463
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,390
If you don't,
you really oughta just shut up

464
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,910
Our daughter...
could have this baby?

465
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,590
You know,even with all these cuts,
I don't feel any pain.

466
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,040
I swear,I have the highest pain
threshold of anybody I know.

467
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:10,480
my god.If I could say something
to that guy and not get fired...

468
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,650
he can't fire me.

469
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,760
Uh,mr. Eckles,brad,

470
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:21,100
I'm happy for you that you're not feeling
much pain from your very minor injuries

471
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,540
but there are a great many people in this
hospital who are in a great amount of pain

472
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,640
See,they have bullets in their bones,
in their chests

473
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,080
and in their brains,bullets
from a gun that was aiming for you

474
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:34,980
And although they can't say it
because you're the boss of them

475
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,920
most of these people,
at this moment,are praying--

476
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,470
not that they'll live,
not that the pain will subside--

477
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:46,780
they're praying to god for you,
at this moment,to shut the heck up

478
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:54,510
no problem.

479
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:59,890
Karev. He stood there
and choose that moron over me

480
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,170
You know,I'm trying to help the dog,

481
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:04,460
and he's standing there
talking about putting the dog down

482
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,150
like doc means nothing.

483
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,530
He's not rewarding karev.

484
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,770
He's punishing me.

485
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,500
And he hates finn,who,
by the way,is great with dogs.

486
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,750
He withholds surgery
when I'm a bad girlfriend

487
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,770
It's his M.O.

488
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,180
I mean,how controlling
and macho and petulant is that?

489
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:22,370
At least he's not shooting people
or putting down dogs

490
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,480
I'm dumping him.

491
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:27,520
This relationship is so over.

492
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,220
Um,I-I told a lie...
to dr. Burke.

493
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:34,640
Good for you.
Fight the power.

494
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:39,190
No,no,I need... um...
god,I can't think.I-I can'T...

495
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:41,050
I-I don't know what to do.

496
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,730
What do I do?

497
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,650
There's this guy ahead of denny
on the transplant list.

498
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,450
he'll get the next heart,iz.

499
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,200
No! He needs to get this heart.

500
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,280
He'll probably get a heart at some point

501
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,630
but as long as denny's doing well
on the lvad

502
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:01,140
and there's someone ahead of him
on the transplant list,

503
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,320
he's not gonna get this heart.Okay?

504
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,240
Yes.
You're right. Okay.

505
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,140
Thank you.

506
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:14,120
Thank you.

507
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:21,780
okay,if I was gonna pick someone who was
gonna go psycho and shoot up the place...

508
00:23:22,670 --> 00:23:24,350
it's izzie.

509
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:25,990
Totally.

510
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:31,720
What's all that?

511
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,000
Heart stuff.

512
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,940
So you're gonna put this heart in me
in my room?

513
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,540
I didn't know transplants were so informal

514
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,900
There--there may not be a heart,denny.

515
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,400
Somebody at mercy west
might get it instead

516
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:51,040
So this isn't gonna happen...
again.

517
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:53,220
Not necessarily.

518
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,520
I have been over this and over this,

519
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,300
and it can't be a lie
and it can't be fake.

520
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,450
We need charts.
We need test results.

521
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:05,080
We need U.N.O.S. To believe us,

522
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,810
so it has to be real.

523
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,660
What are you talking about,izzie?

524
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,190
In order for you to get the heart,

525
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,060
you would have to get worse-much worse--

526
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,260
and you would have to do it very quickly.

527
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,520
Well,I-I don't see that happening.

528
00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,790
You see that happening?

529
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,570
I am gonna make it happen.

530
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,960
It's been 30 minutes already.

531
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:42,290
Is stevens answering her page?

532
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:44,560
She's probably busy getting the test results.

533
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,760
You call bailey?

534
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,770
Uh,she's not answering either.

535
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,850
You can check the chart all you want,
you're not getting this heart.

536
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,280
Well,you may not want it.

537
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,790
His angiogram shows 30% L.A.D.

538
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,560
Still not enough to give it to you.

539
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,680
Izzie.

540
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,590
Izzie,stop and listen to me.

541
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,380
We're not doing this.

542
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,820
Don't worry.

543
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,090
You're not gonna die.

544
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,580
I will be here the whole time
to make sure of that,

545
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,770
and that's what this stuff is for.

546
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,550
This isn't about me dying all right? 
This is wrong.

547
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,540
You have waited a year
and a half to get this thing

548
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,360
Who knows when the next one
is gonna come along?

549
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,350
I'll take my chances.

550
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,220
No! It may be too late by then.

551
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,880
Then it's too late,all right?
Now get this stuff outta here.

552
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,990
Denny...
please...

553
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,410
-you have to do this.
-No,izzie.

554
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:33,160
I'm not about to steal a heart
from another man's chest.

555
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,540
Not to mention,
this will be the end of your medical career

556
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,720
I don't care about my medical career.

557
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,520
All right,you know what?

558
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
This has gone on long enough.
I'm gonna call a nurse.

559
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:45,450
Everyone who is entered into the transplant
program is clocked in to the second.

560
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,520
To the second,denny.

561
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,770
You were clocked in to the second,

562
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,770
and so was the other guy,
I checked with U.N.O.S.

563
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:51,820
The difference between
when you entered the program

564
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:56,230
and when he entered the program
is 17 seconds.

565
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,630
That's it,denny.

566
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,710
17 seconds.

567
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:02,510
I mean,it's not even the length
of a decent kiss.

568
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,350
So this other guy--

569
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,590
I'm not saying that
he doesn't deserve this heart.

570
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,700
I'm sure he does,
but so do you.

571
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,060
So do you.

572
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:17,360
And if you tell me any more crap
about heading towards the light

573
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,860
or looking down on me from heaven,

574
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:22,470
I swear,I will kill you myself right now!

575
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,990
Izzie...

576
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:30,810
just..
.I'm gonna be all right.

577
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,320
All right?
You don't have to worry.

578
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,260
What about me?

579
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,890
What about me when you go to the light?

580
00:26:38,910 --> 00:26:41,680
-Izzie--
-no,I get it...okay? I get it.

581
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:42,990
You'll be okay.

582
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:46,070
You'll be fine.
But what about me?

583
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,930
So don't do it for yourself.

584
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,820
Do it for me,please.

585
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:50,780
Please,denny.

586
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,430
Please do this for me.

587
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:55,480
Because if you die--
oh,god,you have to do this.

588
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,840
You have to do this for me,
or I'll never be able to forgive you.

589
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,560
-For dying?
-No! For making me love you.

590
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,350
Please.

591
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,410
-please do this for me.
-Come here.

592
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,140
Okay? Please.

593
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,560
Okay? I can't do this if you don'T.

594
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:15,780
Please do this for me 
'cause if you don't do this--please.

595
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,260
Okay,I'll do it.

596
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:27,290
I'm in the middle of analyzing an x-ray,

597
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:30,300
and your friend meredith starts
asking me about her dog.

598
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,670
Her dog,george.
She wants a medical opinion about her dog

599
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,650
She likes her dog.

600
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,830
-Why are you defending meredith?
-What?

601
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,020
I get izzie.

602
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,060
I mean,I-I don't,

603
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,910
but if you want to defend izzie,
that's fine.

604
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,080
I-I don't get 
how you can defend meredith.

605
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,480
Hey.

606
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,430
We're interns.
We all started out together.

607
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:51,400
Meredith,izzie,cristina and me--
we started out together.

608
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,860
George,that woman hurt you
as badly as anyone can be hurt

609
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,370
You were devastated when I met you.

610
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:00,920
Look... they're family.

611
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,920
Izzie and meredith and cristina--
they're--they're my family.

612
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:07,450
I can hate meredith,and i can--
I can be angry at her,

613
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,530
but I'm always gonna defend her.

614
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:11,960
So you don't have to forgive meredith,
but I do?

615
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,180
If you want a chance to
be part of the family,yeah.

616
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,700
dr. Burke,hello.

617
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,640
Stevens,where the hell have you been?

618
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,080
Have you got the lab results?

619
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,540
Um... ahem.
I'm working on that.

620
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,400
Stevens,I need answers.

621
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,950
Stevens?

622
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,670
You should get back here
with the heart as soon as you can

623
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:35,070
What the hell are you...
what are you talking about?

624
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,110
Preston...

625
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,930
izzie,what did you do?

626
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:42,090
As soon as I get confirmatory tests
and labs to raise denny's U.N.O.S. Status

627
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,510
I will fax them over to you,

628
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,730
and then you should waste no time
in getting back here

629
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:50,290
because I don't know enough to know
how long denny will have once I start

630
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:53,040
Start?

631
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:56,330
What did you do,izzie?

632
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,580
-What did you do?
-I'm going to hang up now.

633
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,710
Just hurry.

634
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:17,900
according to my intern,
denny duquette is in pulmonary edema

635
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,770
and he has been intubated
and placed on multiple I.V. Drips.

636
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,420
So preston gets the heart.
Great. Let's open this guy.

637
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,020
However... given this unusual situation,

638
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,780
and out of respect to dr. Hahn,

639
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,700
I'd like to confirm those results.

640
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,940
You--you just did.

641
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,860
In person.

642
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,060
I want to confirm them in person.

643
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,360
are you kidding?

644
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:40,060
By the time you get there,
it'll be another hour.

645
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:41,940
What are you up to,burke?

646
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,440
Why don't you just talk to your chief,
confirm the results with him?

647
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,970
Well,because of the shootings today
at the restaurant,

648
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,390
all our attendings are still in surgery.

649
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:56,820
Exactly.

650
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,570
Now if you prefer,I can just call U.N.O.S.

651
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,920
And have them give me the heart.

652
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:04,060
Or I can go and make sure
that it really belongs to me.

653
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,980
Go.

654
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,410
Thank you.

655
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,570
I'm going back to seattle grace.

656
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,350
You stay here and protect my heart.

657
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:20,700
If that woman so much as
looks at a scalpel,tackle her

658
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,890
-Do you understand?
-Yes,sir.

659
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:27,990
Hey,you got a minute?

660
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,100
Are you ready to talk?

661
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,290
Uh,my patient,kendra thomas,
she's brain dead.

662
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,940
Her parents want to
keep her alive to have the baby

663
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,300
So you want me to talk to the parents?

664
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,540
Well,I tried already,
but I figured,you're neonatal

665
00:30:37,590 --> 00:30:39,680
You might have a better shot at it
than I do.

666
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:43,200
It's just that you can give them a much
more detailed picture--I said I'd do it

667
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,110
Mr. And mrs. Thomas,

668
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,250
dr. Shepherd asked me to talk to you
about your daughter and her pregnancy

669
00:30:48,290 --> 00:30:50,350
We've made up our minds.
She's having the baby.

670
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,710
I know kendra meant the world to you,

671
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,630
and I know the terrible grief
you must be going through right now

672
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,590
But from a medical standpoint,
this is a very bad idea.

673
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,160
Well,if we'd wanted your opinion,
miss,we'd ask for it.

674
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:05,420
It's just--we--we love our daughter.

675
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,960
-Please try to understand.
-I do understand.

676
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,120
I do.

677
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:13,030
You think if you love her enoughor
love her baby enough,

678
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,280
that it will keep her close to you.

679
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,100
But she's already gone,and if you
move forward with this,you're risking--

680
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,840
well,I mean,if kendra were to
contract an infection,

681
00:31:20,890 --> 00:31:22,120
she could pass it on to the fetus.

682
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,850
-It could cause brain damage--
-we're taking our chances.

683
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:29,900
They keep organ donors alive
after they're gone.

684
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:31,460
Why not kendra?

685
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,250
Organ donors are not kept alive
for six months.

686
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,560
Your daughter is brain dead.

687
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:38,150
She can't regulate body
temperature,hormone output.

688
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:40,800
These things are very important for a fetus.

689
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,760
You guys can regulate that stuff,right?

690
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,970
-We could try. I--
-well,then try,damn it!

691
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,080
What the hell's the problem here?

692
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,360
The problem here,as I see it,is you want to
use your daughter's corpse as an incubator

693
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,540
-That's the problem.
-okay,I'm sorry.Would you excuse us,please?

694
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,850
-What? What are you doing,derek?
-Let go of me.

695
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,530
-Those people just lost their daughter.
-I know.That was my point,derek.

696
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,310
They need to face that.
She's not coming back.

697
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,220
A little sensitivity would be nice here,okay?

698
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,750
They love their daughter.

699
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,950
-They don't want to let go.All right?
-What they're doing is not about love,derek

700
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,430
It's--it's--
well,it's like you.

701
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,410
Excuse me?

702
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,650
Like how you pretend to love me,

703
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,780
but really,you're just using me to
fill some need you have to be a good guy

704
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,000
Now is not the time to talk about this.
We'll talk about this later.

705
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,510
Oh,what,you walk away?
That's all I get?

706
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,710
-Just calm down,please.
-What? What?

707
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,230
You're not gonna yell at me,
call me names,

708
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,230
or,I-I don't know,ignore me in an elevator?

709
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:26,090
-What do you want from me,addison?
-I want you to care.

710
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:29,100
I sleep with your best friend,
and you walk away.

711
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:31,430
He comes out here from new york
and rubs it in your face,

712
00:32:31,470 --> 00:32:33,490
and still,you get a good night's sleep.

713
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,110
What do I have to do?
Oh,I know.

714
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,970
Maybe what I should do
is go out on a date with the vet

715
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,930
because that seems to be something
that sends you into a blind rage.

716
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:43,660
Oh,but wait,that won't work either,

717
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:46,830
because I'm not meredith grey.

718
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:10,380
I know this is a bad time,

719
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,270
but have you decided if you still want to
go ahead with the baby?

720
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,370
We haven't decided on anything.

721
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,370
Sir...you asked me before
if I had a daughter.

722
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,750
I don't,but I have a family.

723
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,340
I actually have a couple of families.

724
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:35,970
The thing about family is you don't
necessarily like what they do--

725
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,140
their choices and their decisions--
but you stick by them.

726
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,570
Right now,one of my friends,
her boyfriend is dying.

727
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,330
Heart failure. He's 36.

728
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,700
I checked kendra's driver's license.

729
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,740
She's a donor.

730
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,600
She's not a match for him,
but she could save a dozen other lives

731
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:53,730
And from what I know about kendra,
what I've heard,

732
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:58,110
I gotta believe that if she had the choice
between where she is right now

733
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:01,460
and saving a dozen other people,
she'd save those people.

734
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,000
That would be her decision.

735
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:11,650
So the question is whether you stick
by her one last time.

736
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,110
Excuse me.

737
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,680
You paged?

738
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:25,650
Yeah. These are,um...

739
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,700
these are x-rays of a human
with an osteosarcoma on his tibia

740
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,080
It's the closest I could get to mirroring
what's actually happening to your dog

741
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:39,440
In this patient,the cancer was
aggressive and it spread quickly

742
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:42,340
and he died when it finally metastasized
on his lungs.

743
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,520
-The human died?
-Yes,the human died.

744
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:51,820
Thank you,callie.

745
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,770
You're welcome,meredith.

746
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:04,370
Huh. You made up with him.

747
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,350
I told him I'd give him one more chance.

748
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,970
And I told her she won't have to.

749
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,300
What I went through today--

750
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,080
what we went through today--
it's changed me.

751
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:17,460
This bullet will always remind me
to do the right thing by my deborah

752
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,120
Here you go.

753
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:21,880
And whatever's going on with you
and your boyfriend,

754
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:24,050
maybe you should just try
and forgive him.

755
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:27,930
It really feels so much better
than all that anger.

756
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,840
Thanks.

757
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,210
We haven't forgotten you,will.

758
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:41,100
We'll get you the O.R.
As soon as possible.

759
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,340
My friend kendra...

760
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,520
dr. Grey said that if anybody had
any information to give me,

761
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:53,130
that they would let me know
as soon as possible.

762
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:58,450
I'm sorry.

763
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:15,240
I'm--
I'm gonna get you some time off,man

764
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,650
I'm gonna talk to the owner,
make sure they keep your job for you

765
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:21,350
It's not your fault you got shot.

766
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,830
Not my fault either.

767
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,240
You know,I-I didn't--
I didn't pull the trigger.

768
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,970
Petey had the gun.
I'm just saying...

769
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,010
people blame management,but...
we do the best we can.

770
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,990
I mean,I...

771
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:36,510
I do the best I can.

772
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,680
I know what you're gonna say,richard,

773
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,450
but if you knew the day that I had--

774
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,890
everybody in this hospital
has those days,addison,

775
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,730
and no one makes a scene
in front of their peers.

776
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,110
Get it together.

777
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,220
-Addison...
-I can't compete.

778
00:36:58,940 --> 00:36:59,970
He's not having an affair,

779
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,780
he's not trying to hurt me,
he's just...

780
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:09,400
the only people who don't know derek
loves meredith are derek and meredith

781
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,160
How do I compete with that?

782
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,430
So what makes anger different
from the six other deadly sins?

783
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,650
it's pretty simple really.

784
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:59,300
You give in to a sin like envy or pride,
and you only hurt yourself.

785
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,750
I love you.

786
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,090
I'm sorry. I'M...

787
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,170
I-I didn't mean to--
I just--I...

788
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,240
I-I have verbal diarrhea,
and I'm a moron.

789
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:20,010
What are you thinking?
Are you--are you freaking out?

790
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,630
George,I need your help.

791
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,580
I wouldn't ask if it weren't important. 
It's--

792
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:27,140
okay.

793
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:30,550
I'll call you... later?

794
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,070
Sure.

795
00:38:36,390 --> 00:38:39,590
were we supposed to have dinner tonight?

796
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,990
Tell me the truth about doc.

797
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,670
What about him?

798
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:48,680
You've been downplaying
how sick he is,haven't you?

799
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:52,940
best case scenario,I would say
doc has maybe a year left.

800
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,520
Okay.

801
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,860
And doc is not the best case scenario.

802
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,880
Okay.

803
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:03,140
-Meredith?
-Damn it.

804
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,520
Oh,I'M...I'm sorry.

805
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:10,090
I am so sorry.
I know how much you love him.

806
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,110
I do.

807
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,750
I love him so much.

808
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,460
You need my help for an E.K.G.?

809
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:23,490
No. Come.

810
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,220
Okay,after I do this,
I might have to shock you a few of times

811
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,060
Do what?

812
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,580
You feelin' good?

813
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:31,950
I think so.

814
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,660
Explain this to me again.

815
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,120
The,the lvad has been inserted
into your abdomen

816
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,700
and is connected to your heart.

817
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,410
This cord leads to the power source.

818
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,090
This one is connected to the pump
that pumps your heart for you.

819
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:46,630
I have the crash cart,the defibrillator,
the ambu bag,saline--

820
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:48,230
do what,izzie?

821
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:51,710
I feel like we should say stuff.

822
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,800
denny,do you want to say stuff?

823
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:57,470
Kiss me... right here.

824
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,480
See?

825
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:07,550
A kiss is worth a thousand words.

826
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,520
A picture. 
A picture is worth a thousand words

827
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,060
You're gonna correct me
at a time like this?

828
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,440
I don't mean to be intrusive--

829
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:16,310
just give me a second,george!

830
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:19,400
okay...
you ready?

831
00:40:19,470 --> 00:40:22,330
As I'll ever be.

832
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,280
Wait,what are you doin'?

833
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,800
Try lust or coveting,

834
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,550
and you'll only hurt yourself
and probably one or two others.

835
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,290
But anger...

836
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,220
anger is the worst...

837
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,270
okay,we're done.

838
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:49,160
What is that?
Are those gunshots?

839
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:52,680
The mother of all sins.

840
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,600
Petey.

841
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,560
Denny,if there really is
some kind of big,glowing light--

842
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:58,710
I'm gonna try like hell to stay out of it.

843
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,020
-Exactly.
-I don't like the sound of this.

844
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,960
Just make sure nobody comes through
that door.

845
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,870
What are you doing?

846
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:13,300
I'm stopping his heart,george.

847
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,480
Not only can anger
drive you over the edge

848
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,130
when it does,

849
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:22,910
you can take an awful
lot of other people with you

850
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,930
Izzie...
