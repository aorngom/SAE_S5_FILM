1
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:03,430
previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,150
pick me. Choose me. Love me.

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,690
I need to not die emotionally
crippled and alone.

4
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:11,990
Callie... what I did to
you I-is unforgivable.

5
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:13,900
so you two are together?

6
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,330
You know what? You're
inappropriate and unprofessional.

7
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:19,440
Dr.Hahn has agreed to bome our
new head of cardiothoracic surgery.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,200
Lookin' forward to it,dr.Yang.

9
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,230
My wife has filed for divorce.

10
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:25,660
I don't know if I can handle
one more night in that hotel.

11
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:27,120
You can say anything to me.

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,480
I want to marry you,and
you're not ready.

13
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,030
there's this thing
about being a surgeon--

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,690
maybe it's pride or maybe
it's just about being tough--

15
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,230
but a true surgeon never admits they
need help unless absolutely necessary.

16
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,590
What are your other symptoms?

17
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:49,410
Okay,there's the father thing...

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,520
The mother thing,the sister thing...

19
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,050
-mm,the dying-and-coming-back- to-life
thing. -You have too many things.

20
00:00:58,060 --> 00:00:59,490
I can't sleep.

21
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,460
I can't sleep without the dreaming.

22
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,170
And the panic attacks.

23
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,970
-One. One panic attack.
-Okay,still.

24
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,320
What's wrong with me?

25
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,550
As far as I can tell,severe
abandonment issues.

26
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,460
that's crap. Psych is crap.

27
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,700
Issues?

28
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,860
I mean,it's-- it's in the
book. The book said it,not me.

29
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:22,370
have you considered maybe
you and derek should...

30
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,490
stop having breakup sex?

31
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay.

32
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,970
The more available he gets...

33
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:40,150
the more I pull away.

34
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,200
What do you mean?

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,720
Nothing. It's a derek thing.

36
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,790
Surgeons don't need to ask for help
'cause they're tougher than that.

37
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,800
Surgeons are cowboys-- rough
around the edges,hard-core.

38
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,670
Least,that's what
they want you to think.

39
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,960
ah,good morning.

40
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,300
Oh,perfect timing.

41
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,330
Trout for breakfast.

42
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,520
Again.

43
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,740
Yeah,don't start. I let you live
on my land,so don't--don't start.

44
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:17,720
I'm older than you. I've just
seen life from both sides now.

45
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:18,780
You gonna start singing?

46
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,790
I'm just saying that a man who is up fishing at
3:00 every morning is a man in pain over a woman.

47
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,620
Oh,good. A country-western song.

48
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:30,020
I'm pointing out it's a
thing we have in common,derek.

49
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,500
You know,what we need is something
to take our mind off of everything.

50
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,070
What we need...

51
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:42,010
is a gentlemen's evening.

52
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:46,220
-A what? -A good, old--fashioned
gentlemen's evening...

53
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:48,180
tonight.

54
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,140
this is absurd.

55
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,870
You shouldn't be sleeping
in the on call room.

56
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,720
It's not always an on call room. Sometimes
it's a gurney in the tunnels and the...

57
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,640
it's absurd...

58
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,790
when I have a perfectly good bed.

59
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,850
And I know that we said we would wait and be
respectful,and we have been very respectful.

60
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,280
but now I want sex.

61
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,290
-Right now?
-no.

62
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,350
Tonight.

63
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,040
Tonight we will have...

64
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:36,380
hot,perfect sex.

65
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,890
-You in?
-Yeah,I'm obviously in.

66
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,230
I gotta go.

67
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:45,170
I got patients to check
on,erica hahn to impress.

68
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:48,910
I'm gonna go kick some cardio
ass. Oh,god. I gotta shave my legs.

69
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,230
It's okay if you don't,you
know,have ahance to shave your legs.

70
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,910
No,it's not.

71
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,910
It is not okay,george.
I have to shave my legs.

72
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,500
I will be shaving my legs.
Hot,perfect sex requires shaved legs.

73
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,040
Okay.

74
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,040
Erica hahn--
first day.

75
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,190
Oh,first day indeed,and a
mountain of paperwork to prove it.

76
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,280
Derek shepherd,you know erica hahn.

77
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:12,520
You're the new burke.

78
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,380
And this is dr.Mark sloan,head
of plastics. Erica hahn.

79
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:18,000
Ah,the new burke.

80
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,870
Welcome. Excuse us.

81
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:27,110
Interesting guys,and by "interesting"
I mean "ridiculously attractive.

82
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:31,160
do you hire on looks alone,or
is actual skill a factor?

83
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,260
-Good to have you here,erica.
-Good to be here,richard.

84
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,210
What exactly is a gentlemen's evening?

85
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:38,920
I don't know. It's an
evening with gentlemen.

86
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,600
And strippers?

87
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,790
No,I don't--I don't think
the chief meant strippers.

88
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,240
Sure sounds like strippers. Dr.Bailey?

89
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,850
What's the first thing that comes to mind
when I say the words "gentlemen's evening"?

90
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,550
Tassels. Shiny,sequined
tassels and $1 bills.

91
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,800
See? Strippers.

92
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,710
There will be no strippers.
I'm almost positive.

93
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,630
So you don't know what
this thing is either?

94
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,820
No,but you're in?

95
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:01,480
Why not? I like to be surprised.

96
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,370
Okay. Oh,heads-up. Mr.Incredible,12:00.

97
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,130
Hi.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,760
Hi.

99
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:11,490
What the hell was that about?

100
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,620
That was about a date we have later
in the on call room. It's nothing.

101
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,880
Well,you sure seem to be losing
sleep over a whole lot of "nothing.

102
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,750
" This is it-- hahn is in the
hospital,freakin' izzie is on her service again.

103
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,650
I'm gonna ride this trauma
train straight back into cardio.

104
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,110
Okay,what do we got?

105
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,890
Uh,two ambulances,multiple traumas.

106
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:30,040
Any chance you need a
resident's help,dr.Torres?

107
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:35,630
As long as you want to smash
bones into dust while people cry.

108
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:38,020
Sweet. What do you got?

109
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:39,700
Chest pain,tamponade,ruptured aorta?

110
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,480
Uh,more like a clown car.

111
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,570
Jackie escott,25 years old-- dislocated
shoulder lac to her thigh,vital signs are stable.

112
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,500
And helena
boyd,26 years old--

113
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:53,110
also stable with obvious nasal fracture
facial lacs and a chunk of missing scalp.

114
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,370
-She ripped out my hair.
-She ripped out my shoulder!

115
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,970
You pped out your own shoulder when you
were trying to push me off of the platform!

116
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,890
Who let go of the dress? Did
anybody let go of the dress?

117
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:02,610
Hang in there,honey. Don't let
her psych you out,all right?

118
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,450
Okay,what the hell's all this?

119
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,950
It's a store contest. I'm the judge.

120
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,990
Last one to let go of the dress-

121
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,470
-- wins the wedding of
my dreams. -Of my dreams.

122
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,800
All right,enough. You
two are injured,okay?

123
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,210
You need to get your priorities
straight and let go of the--

124
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:18,130
let go--let go of the
dress so we can treat you.

125
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,850
All right,let go now. Now.

126
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,930
That's not gonna happen.

127
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,770
All right. Fine. Let's move.

128
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:36,670
oh,please let this be something
good,something cardio good. Please.

129
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,600
33-year-old male discovered unconscious but
stable having survived a 12,000-foot free fall.

130
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,520
A what?

131
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,890
His parachute didn't open.

132
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:47,210
Wait,he fell 12,000
feet without a parachute?

133
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,660
thank you.

137
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:54,270
What's his name?

138
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,480
Rick. I'm rick jacobs.

139
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,580
He's talking?

140
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,790
you'd think after 12,000 feet,he'd
have at least a punctured lung.

141
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,300
where is he? Where are you?

142
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,860
Oh,my god. There you arE.

143
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,440
How is he? How is he?
Is he okay? Is he dying?

144
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,850
No,I'm not dying,sally.

145
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,670
Okay,ma'am,you need to calm down.

146
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,580
Is this yourife?

147
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,430
My skydiving instructor.

148
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:15,380
-Well,ma'am- -I
watched the whole thing.

149
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,450
I-I couldn't do anything. I was
just--I was just in the clouds floating,

150
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,690
watching while he--while he-- while
he--you-- you fell to your death.

151
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,160
His chute didn't open.

152
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:28,130
Ma'am,okay,we need to do our jobs,and you're
making that difficult by hovering over the patient.

153
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,610
P-please have a seat and breathe.

154
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:35,460
I heard we have a skydiver
who fell 12,000 feet.

155
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,970
That'd be me.

156
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,840
-hello.
-Hi.

157
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,820
He's talking?

158
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,630
Clearly he's in shock,can't
feel the extent of his injuries.

159
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,700
Let's get him down for a C.T.

160
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,010
Cristina,where are you going?

161
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,570
Multiple injuries means multiple
surgeries. I'm going to get me some cardio.

162
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,690
Okay,do you see that you're
bleeding all over the dress?

163
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,270
It's not about the dress.

164
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,800
I can't,uh,I can't-- there's
too much blood down here.

165
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,260
Which one of your legs is bleeding?

166
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,740
I don't know. I can't
really feel anything anymore.

167
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:11,030
I hear you have a broken nose
down here. What's with the dress?

168
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:12,470
It's n about the dress.

169
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,080
Can't they--can't they
just split the prize?

170
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:17,000
I offered. I offered that 14 hours ago.

171
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:22,190
It is a $100,000 wedding package,and
I am not splitting it with anyone.

172
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,420
oh,you're bleeding on your dress.

173
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,190
it's not about the dress!

174
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,530
Uh,uh,I'm gonna have to
stabilize that shoulder somehow.

175
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,600
I'll go grab a sling.

176
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,210
-Well,this is cozy.
-This is hell.

177
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:35,010
I assigned o'malley to you to keep him away from
me,and now our patients are connected to each other.

178
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,460
You're not looking at this
like the opportunity it is.

179
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,170
-Meaning?
-Meaning he's an intern.

180
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,540
It's,like,half my job,torturing interns.

181
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,910
thanks. That's--
that's almost sweet.

182
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:47,410
But torturing george is not
gonna make any of this any better.

183
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,740
Torture him how,exactly?

184
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,090
My hands always get
so sweaty in hospitals.

185
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,360
It's the weirdest thing.

186
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:03,220
It's pretty common,actually.

187
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,020
If it makes you feel any better,dr.Hahn
has done this procedure hundreds of times.

188
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:12,310
And she's really gonna thread a catheter
up my leg,all the way to my heart?

189
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:15,430
Trust me,you are in excellent hands.

190
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:17,740
But,um,I--I'll
be out,right?

191
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:20,970
Oh,yeah,you'll be asleep.
You won't remember a thing.

192
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:24,270
Ivory-billed woodpecker.

193
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,250
I'm sorry?

194
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,500
Ivory-billed woodpecker-- that's
what's getting me through this.

195
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,380
I'm a,uh,lifelong birdwatcher.

196
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:41,240
And when I get through this,I am finally
going to scout the ivory-billed woodpecker.

197
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,500
It is so rare.

198
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,900
You know,we--we
thought it was extinct.

199
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,110
But it's not.

200
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,200
It lives in arkansas...

201
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:56,360
in this one little patch of swamp.

202
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:04,200
Do you have any idea how incredible it
is to see a bird like that in person?

203
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,030
I'm sorry.

204
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:11,480
Uh,I'll be just one second.

205
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:13,460
Why are you hovering?

206
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,970
Guess what just came into the pit.

207
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,570
No,no,don't guess. I'll tell you.

208
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,910
Skydiver.

209
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:23,160
Skydiver whose chute didn't open,who fell
12,000 feet and landed in some shrubbery.

210
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,350
Poor guy. He probably broke
every bone in his body.

211
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,920
No,the point is not "poor guy.
" The point is amazing surgery.

212
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:37,820
And it could be yours for the low,low
price of a humdrum,everyday cardio cath.

213
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,580
Yeah,forget it. I'm not
giving up hahn's service.

214
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,280
Hey,hey,izzie,you know
what? Cardio is my thing.

215
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,370
No.

216
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:47,990
I like this patient,I like
hahn,and I like cardio.

217
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,570
No,you are-- you are
flirting with cardio.

218
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:52,690
I am married to cardio.

219
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:58,290
You will marry general surgery
or,you know,okay,perhaps neuro.

220
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:03,450
but you,you are nowhere near
hard-core enough to commit to cardio.

221
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:08,640
So you are telling me to stop
flirting with your husband.

222
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,590
I get it. That's cute.

223
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,420
But if you're gonna ask me for a favor,insulting
my personal life is probably not a great tactic.

224
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,560
No,no,no,wait. I am not
talking about your sex life.

225
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,130
I could not care less
about your sex life.

226
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,170
It's a skydiver,izzie. Skydiver.

227
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,660
Sounds real cool. Enjoy it.

228
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:28,950
if his intestines look like I think they
will,that's gonna take first priority.

229
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,020
He could have delayed paralysis.

230
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,830
This is not a contest,gentlemen.

231
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:38,850
But since a perfed bowel could kill the guy whether or not his
spine's in working order, my money's on the chief going first.

232
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,100
Hey,what'd I miss?

233
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:43,110
Any cardiothoracic concerns?
I'd be happy to page dr.Hahn.

234
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,080
Sc's coming up.

235
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,600
here it is. Wait for it.

236
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,120
w-wait. Wait.

237
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,580
oh,that can't be right,can it?

238
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,390
I'm not seeing any free
fluid,any intraperitoneal gases.

239
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,240
Does anybody see anything?

240
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,650
There! Right there. A hematoma.

241
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,670
in the right lower quadrant.

242
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,940
It's the appendix.

243
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:11,330
W-we're saying this guy fell 12,000 feet,and
basically all he needs is an appendectomy?

244
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,810
you're charting... in a closet.

245
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,540
I get a lot of work done in
here. It's quiet and nice.

246
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:29,580
And a closet.

247
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,570
Look...

248
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:38,430
when I'm out there roaming the floors,okay, I am the
other grey that dr.Yang likes to humiliate and kick around.

249
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:42,800
And--and in here,I'm--I'm not. You
know,in--in here,I'm-- it's just--

250
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:48,280
it's--it's my place,okay?
It's--it's a closet.

251
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,600
You know,every intern classhas
its runt of the litter.

252
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,660
You keep this up,this
year it's gonna be you.

253
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,300
Get up.

254
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,870
Oh,sorry. You probably
need to get in here.

255
00:12:58,930 --> 00:13:01,690
No,grab--grab a sling from
the box and come with me.

256
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,730
With you?

257
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,770
Well,if you'd rather sit like a loser
in a closet doing charts,you can.

258
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,680
Or you can come help me on
ortho today. Your choice.

259
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,880
No way. No frickin' way.

260
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:15,390
it's the only solution if neither
of you will let go of the dress.

261
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:21,350
it's very simple. Dr.Torres needs to treat jackie's
shoulder and leg,so,jackie,you need a proxy.

262
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,590
What?

263
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,560
Think about it,babe. This
gives you an advantage.

264
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,180
You get to rest your hand
and come back refreshed.

265
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,460
Give me the dress. I'll be the proxy.

266
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,170
No way.

267
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,860
This isn't fair. You think this is fair?

268
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,640
Dr.O'malley's the proxy.

269
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,190
What?

270
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,930
He'll hold on to the dress.

271
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,060
Hold the dress? You just want me to...

272
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,740
stand here and hold a dress?

273
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,940
No one every said internship was easy.

274
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,130
Dude,you're job kinda sucks,huh?

275
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,630
Hello? Watch the shoulder.

276
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:08,730
Oh,check it out. Bambi's a bridesmaid.

277
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,970
you're right. This did cheer me up.

278
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,370
you've got no lung injuries,no
spinal injuries,no broken bones.

279
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,520
-You're just a lucky man.
-Holy crap.

280
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,940
The only thing we found was a little
bleeding in your lower abdomen.

281
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,910
Which means we have to
remove your appendix.

282
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,100
How's that even possible?

283
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:33,860
Uh,the body's an amazing thing. You
know,sometimes these things,they just happen.

284
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:38,610
If you had died... god.

285
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:42,200
I didn't though. I lived.

286
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,690
it's just the most amazing feeling.

287
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,830
I feel like I could
do anything right now.

288
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,060
I mean,anything in the world
because I faced death and I...

289
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,910
I survived.

290
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,880
-It changes a person.
-It does.

291
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,840
It so does.

292
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:03,950
Sally...sal,I have
to-- I want to,um--

293
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,110
don't worry.

294
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:09,260
The minute-- the minute we get out
of here,I am so destroying that video.

295
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:13,960
You will never have to-- to relive that
horrible-- in fact,where's your helmet?

296
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,600
I'm gonna destroy that video right now.

297
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,990
Sally. Sal...

298
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,110
wait.

299
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,220
Did she say "video"?

300
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,460
the trick is to envision the artery like a
spaghetti noodle-- pliable,but not too fragile.

301
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,990
Good morning.

302
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,660
Oh,this is an unexpected
surprise,chief. You need something?

303
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:37,210
Oh,first day. Just wanted to
see how you were settling in.

304
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,140
you see that?

305
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,470
It's a blockage,left main coronary
artery. It's totally closed off.

306
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:47,280
There's no way I'm getting a stent in
there. We're gonna have to open him up.

307
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,310
B.P.'S dropping to 58 over 20.

308
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,360
His heart's racing.

309
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,340
And his temp's rising.
Muscles are rigid.

310
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:57,570
All right,let's bring him off
anesthesia and start him on 100% o-2.

311
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,560
He's got malignant hypothermia.

312
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,950
So he's allergic to the anestsia?

313
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,790
He'll never be able to endure the cabg.

314
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,790
So what are our options?

315
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,450
that's just,uh...

316
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,100
I mean,it sounds like
you're telling me...

317
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:24,070
you're not actually telling
me I'M... I'm gonna die?

318
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,590
The blockage we found in your heart needs
surgery,extensive surgery. angioplasty won't work.

319
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,320
And since you're allergic
to the anesthesia...

320
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,460
so I'll just,uh...

321
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:41,440
I'll be like this.

322
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,070
I'll be sick...

323
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:47,710
and exhausted...

324
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,340
and like this...

325
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,440
until one day when I'll...

326
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,600
just,uh...

327
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:57,600
die.

328
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:06,090
It would've been wonderful...

329
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:08,950
to see that bird.

330
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:13,450
It would've been wonderful.

331
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,790
Com ark) you're crowding me,o'malley.

332
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:26,290
Hey,hey,I think he just let go. You
just let go of the dress,didn't you?

333
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,030
No.

334
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:28,560
I wish to god he had.

335
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:34,510
I swear,if you let go and lose this contest
after my jackie almost died to win it

336
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:38,730
-
- dude,a busted shoulder does not mean she almost died. Okay?

337
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,210
Whatever.

338
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:42,690
I'm watching you.

339
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,930
I know you all think this is stupid.

340
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,160
If I were you,I would
think this is really stupid.

341
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:55,220
Ll,I've never been married myself,so I'm not one to
judge,but george here knows all about what it takes.

342
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,400
Don't you,o'malley?

343
00:17:56,470 --> 00:17:58,830
You're married? For how long?

344
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,090
Not very long.

345
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:03,920
Newlywedongratulatations.

346
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,970
Thanks.

347
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:12,200
Now,jackie,dr.Karev and i are gonna
do this on the count of three,okay?

348
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,790
I should totally win over that helena
girl. I'm am way more injured than she is.

349
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,910
I should just win by default.

350
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,120
One...

351
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:21,220
two...

352
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,630
three.

353
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,450
Is it in?

354
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:30,980
It popped back out.

355
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,370
She's gonna need surgery.

356
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:37,600
Hey,no.I gotta get back to my dress. Just
wrap some bandages around it or something.

357
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:42,270
You would rather hold on to a dress with a dislocated
shoulder than let me repair it in surgery for you right now?

358
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:47,500
I can have surgery anytime. I
can only win this wedding once.

359
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:02,460
So what,heust stands
there and holds a dress?

360
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,460
I know. I thought it was
gonna be more exciting,too.

361
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,590
A monkey could hold a dress.

362
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,730
Actually,this is a lot
harder than it looks.

363
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:13,710
don't let them get to you.
Tune them out,all of them.

364
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,650
It's the only way to get through it.

365
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,550
Sweetie,he's your
competition. Don't help him.

366
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,960
You ever give morphine to
people who aren't patients?

367
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,110
This kinda blows.

368
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,710
It's more fun when you heckle.

369
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,720
Don't heckle,george.

370
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,880
Yeah,whatever. I got
something way better than this.

371
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,000
Something that tops
o'malley playing bride?

372
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,080
Skydiver video.

373
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,780
What are we doing?

374
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:42,450
Video from the helmet of
a skydiver without a chute.

375
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,300
You guys are sick.

376
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,070
Oh,it's not a snuff
film. The guy survives.

377
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,410
holy...

378
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,670
Oh,is he...

379
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,280
oh,no,he's going for it.
He's going for the chute.

380
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:54,220
Oh,and it doesn't open.

381
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,280
Now he's flailing.

382
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,490
He's going for his second chute.

383
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,090
-oh,jeez.
-Oh,also doesn't open.

384
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,560
You'd think there'd be more screaming.

385
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,360
Oh,ok how close the ground is getting.

386
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,950
-Wh-what's he doing
now? -Peeing his pants.

387
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,320
Is he saying something? Turn it up.

388
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:09,220
God,I wish would've told
you. I am so in love with you.

389
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,070
I-I love you. I love you.
I love you,sally. I--ohh!

390
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,960
who's sally?

391
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,890
-His skydiving instructor.
-Sad.

392
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,210
Hey,what are you even doing here?
Aren't you supposed to be in surgery?

393
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,980
The guy is allergic to anesthesia.
The surgery was canceled.

394
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,010
I drowned.

395
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,080
I was sinking...

396
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,140
I died.

397
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,950
And you know what I realized?

398
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,000
I realized how stupid
all of my issues are.

399
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:47,850
I'm waiting for how this applies to me.

400
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,070
-It doesn'T.
-Of course not.

401
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:56,870
Well,that man fell,and all he wanted was one
last chance to tell sall how he felt about her.

402
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,020
And I got one last
chance. I got my chance.

403
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,080
And what have I done with it?

404
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:10,020
You know,being aware of your crap and actually
overcoming your crap are two very different things.

405
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,730
-I know.
-Okay,found it.

406
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:22,310
dr.Hahn,I know how you can do the surgery
on the patient who is allergic to anesthesia.

407
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,820
Well,no anesthesia means no ventilator.

408
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:27,770
No ventilator means no cabg. Not
a whole lot of wiggle room there.

409
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,150
You can operate on him while he's awake.

410
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:33,270
Yang-- you can use a high thoracic
epidural to numb him from the chest down.

411
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,040
Let him breathe on his
own the entire time.

412
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,340
I mean,they pulled it off in india
last month,and then again in--

413
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,930
dr.Hahn,you wanted to sign the
discharge papers for mr.Arnold?

414
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,140
Not quite yet.

415
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,190
Wide awake?

416
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:55,500
You want me to let you slice open
my chest while I'm wide awake?

417
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:58,430
It is your best option.

418
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,650
Uh,how...

419
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:09,020
how long would i have to be lying there,uh,on
the table with my chest open,uh,like that?

420
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:12,640
the surgery can take up to
five or six hours. Maybe more.

421
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:16,440
uh,six hours...

422
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,010
awake...

423
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,640
w-with you operating on my heart. I...

424
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,880
the ivory-billed woodpecker.

425
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:24,400
-What?
-What?

426
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,480
The ivory-billed woodpecker. Mr.Arnold

427
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:31,400
you want to live to see it,don't
you? This is your only chance.

428
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,400
Ivory-billed woodpecker.

429
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,570
Excellent.

430
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:42,830
Stevens,we will scrub in
as soon as an O.R. Is free.

431
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,280
Uh,but the surgery was cristina's idea.

432
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,590
Either you want in or you don'T.

433
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:48,350
-Which is it?
-I do.

434
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:51,770
Uh,but-- I'm sure there'll be
standing room in the gallery,yang.

435
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:54,680
Stevens,book the O.R.

436
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,570
uh,chief.

437
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,830
Awake open-hrt surgery?

438
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:07,160
I want to talk to you about tonight.

439
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,300
Have you heard about this awake open-heart surgery?

440
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,260
I've invited sloan and,

441
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:14,410
um,well,I'm wondering what I should tell him to expect.

442
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,430
Mm,tell him to expect a good time.

443
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:20,090
Okay,so what is that,poker,cigars,whiskey?

444
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:22,360
I mean,what kind of things?

445
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,150
A good time,shep.

446
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,620
You know?

447
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:36,190
You have no idea the kind of stamina it takes to stand in a display window for two days.

448
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:40,140
It's the hardest thing I've ever done,like,ever.

449
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,900
You're risking permanent damage to your shoulder over a contest.

450
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,020
What does your dress look like?

451
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:52,900
Strapless,sweetheart neckline,crystal beading-

452
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,390
- so pretty.

453
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,250
But you're gonna wear your hair down,though,right?

454
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,980
You know,to cover the hunchback?

455
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,660
The what?

456
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,380
Oh,it's just,since you're ignoring dr.Torres' advice about getting the surgery,

457
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:06,920
you know,your shoulder is probably gonna be pretty swollen and purple

458
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,260
--you know,kind of like a hunchback?

459
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,360
But your hair should totally cover it.

460
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,790
I mean,probably,with the right veil.

461
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,880
You didn't tell me that.

462
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,660
How soon can we have the surgery?

463
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,110
dr.Hahn.

464
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,580
I heard a crazy rumor about you.

465
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,190
That I'm performing open-heart surgery on a man who's wide awake?

466
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,920
That's the rumor that's the truth.

467
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,070
Well,I perform awake brain surgery all the time.

468
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:34,670
Not the same thing.

469
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:37,590
You ever heard of a gentlemen's evening?

470
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:38,830
I'm sorry?

471
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,180
The chief is hosting a gentlemen's evening.

472
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,940
We're pretty sure it doesn't involve porn,

473
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,840
but,you know,we want to be sure.

474
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,520
Right.

475
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,710
Are you two a couple?

476
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:53,210
that's--no.

477
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,610
Just checking.

478
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,930
Why would she ask that?

479
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:00,880
I don't know.

480
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,860
I'm--I'm worried about this gentlemen's thing.

481
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:04,930
George...

482
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:06,730
you got a second?

483
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,600
Seriously?

484
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,360
one se.hi.

485
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,470
We're gonna have to push bac our perfect evening tonight.

486
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:23,490
Not by much-- a few hours,I think.

487
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,730
Sure.

488
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,070
Okay.

489
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:30,990
I'm about to scrub in on an awake open-heart surgery.

490
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,440
-A what? -Awake.

491
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,910
The patient's gonna be wide awake while we operate on his heart.

492
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,310
That is intense. -It is.

493
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:38,490
It is intense.It'S...

494
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,010
you know,cristina would be all over this.

495
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:47,890
She would be studying and quizzing herself,and all I can think about is--is the poor guy.

496
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:49,940
You know,he's really nervous already,and...

497
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,410
I'm not hard-core.

498
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,140
I'm nohard-core enough for this.

499
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,950
Yes,you are.

500
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:59,730
What,you're just-- you're just not like cristina.

501
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,000
You're hard-core.

502
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:04,840
You're hard-core like izzie.

503
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:10,160
did that just sound dirty?'Cause that's not how I meant it.

504
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,120
Mean it,man.

505
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,670
Shut--

506
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,340
go kick ass in the surgery,and then we'll have our night,and it will be perfect.

507
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,990
Oh,I have not shaved my legs yet.

508
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:21,360
Go be hard-core izzie.

509
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:23,140
Go. -Okay,got it.going

510
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,810
Thank you. -Bye.

511
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,320
She's hot,man.

512
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,270
-- Is she your wife?

513
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,000
I don't know you well enough to have this conversation.

514
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,720
Chief,you paged?

515
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,240
Close the door.

516
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:49,890
You had the nerve to tell a patient you would perform awake open-heart surgery without running it past me?

517
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,710
Did burke run every surgery past you?

518
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:53,730
Erica,I know you're new here... -no.

519
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,030
But we run-- I just want to know what the rules are.

520
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,260
Every surgery burke booked,he ran it up the flagpole first?

521
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,770
And what about pretty and prettier?

522
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,780
They run all their surgeries past you?

523
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,860
Wait,you're talking about shepherd and sloan?

524
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,230
I am talking about your male attendings.

525
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:11,470
You know,the ones you invited to your gentlemen's evening?

526
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,580
Guess you don't know a guy till you work for him.

527
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,420
I mean,who knew you were running some kind of old boys' club?

528
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,470
No,that is not it.

529
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:21,750
What we were-- you realize that an evening to which the male attendings are invited and the women are not

530
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:25,690
-- you realize that that's a lot like when law firms used to have country club weekends

531
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,590
and failed to invi the black sociates?

532
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,850
Good talk.

533
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,680
I gotta prep for my surgery.

534
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,020
remember when I was dead?

535
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,140
Before I went in that water,everything was so...

536
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,090
complicated and hard.

537
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,750
And then you pulled me out of the water.

538
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,330
And I came back to life.

539
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,920
For a moment,everything was so clear...

540
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,300
as if the water had washed everything clean.

541
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,970
Do you remember that?

542
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,620
I do.

543
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,500
Me,too.

544
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:27,610
I don't know how you guys did this for two days.

545
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:32,350
Believe me,I would be at city hall tomorrow if that were an option.

546
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:36,750
It is an option.You could just...let go.

547
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,010
You let go.

548
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,330
You let go,and it's no big deal.It's a wedding.

549
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:47,660
I let go,and I haveo face the wrath of dr.Sloan.

550
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,770
My mom manages a grocery store,

551
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:57,580
and ever since I got engaged,she's been putting herself into serious debt

552
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,880
over hand-engraved place cards and chocolate fountains.

553
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,180
It's her dream.

554
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,880
My wedding is her dream.

555
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,920
This is so important to her.

556
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,620
This is what she's been living for since I can remember,since...

557
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:17,800
my dad left.

558
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:22,030
My perfect night.

559
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,790
So...

560
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,040
I can do this.

561
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,590
I can do this for her...

562
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,980
because she's done a lot for me.

563
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,900
Get me a crash cart right now.

564
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:52,370
must have happened when she fell this morning,which means she was bleeding all day.

565
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,960
She seemed just fine.

566
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,430
She must have been feeling some major pain.

567
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,460
Yeah,holding on to that dress,that wasn't easy for her.

568
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,060
It was humiliating.It was--

569
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:06,570
but when someone's trying to break you,it gives you drive,gives you strength.

570
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:11,370
Holding on to that dress for hours--I mean,days-- you know,just...

571
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:15,600
and in public,refusing to buckle,refusing to beg--

572
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,700
that hard-core.I mean,in its own way,that's seriously hard-core.

573
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,100
Rumor has it that sloan was busy hazing one of his interns today.

574
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,960
I take it you didn't buckle.

575
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,340
No,sir.

576
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,620
Good man,o'malley.

577
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,620
uh,I can't feel anything from the neck down.

578
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,990
It's almost like the rest of me just...

579
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,760
doesn't exist.

580
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:09,370
Okay,the sound you're about to hear,that's the saw.

581
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,400
that--that's not a pretty sound.

582
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,950
I brought you some music.

583
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:16,800
Just listen to this and tune it all out.

584
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,380
and--and--and that smell.

585
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:25,460
That--that smell is not--that's the cautery.

586
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,840
I-I know it's hard,but you'll get used to it.

587
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,520
In a moment or two,you won't even notice it.I promise.

588
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:42,210
he jumped out of that plane.

589
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:43,870
No one forced him to do it.

590
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:46,360
Fell 12,000 feet.

591
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,590
People chasing death down,then trying to cheat it.

592
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:51,710
Doesn't make any kind of sense to me.

593
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:54,470
There's a clarity thing.

594
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:57,340
When you cross over the edge,

595
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:03,760
there's a moment when everything...just melts away,and you're fearless.

596
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,930
I get it.I understand wanting to feel like that.

597
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,320
You're awake.

598
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:19,370
Did I win?

599
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,580
You should know that your surgery went very well.

600
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,010
But who won?

601
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,020
I-is she still holding on?

602
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,420
Helena collapsed.

603
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,720
She's in surgery.

604
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,930
So--so I won?

605
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:38,160
She--she collapsed,which-- which means I won,right?

606
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:40,930
Where--where's the judge?

607
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:44,900
You--the woman that you stood next to for two days almost died.

608
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:49,470
Okay,you've just woken up from surgery,and all that you can think about is if you won a stupid contest?

609
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,780
Don't you get it?

610
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,930
You--you shouldn't have to fight this hard for a wedding.

611
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,410
You fight for a marriage,and sometimes even that is a lost cause.

612
00:33:57,450 --> 00:33:59,400
Sometimes you have to know when to let go.

613
00:33:59,470 --> 00:34:00,980
So just let go already,all right?

614
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,170
Just frickin' let go.

615
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,510
Yeah,buT...

616
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:10,290
d-did I win?

617
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:31,930
izzie stuck a picture of a bird on an empty saline bag and put it in his eyeline.

618
00:34:31,990 --> 00:34:34,240
That's smart.I wouldn't have thought of that.

619
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:46,180
she doesn't let me take care of her.

620
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,770
It's not my job anymore.

621
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,390
She won't let me.

622
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,940
I'm taking care of her.

623
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,640
You're,uh...

624
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,880
you're,uh,you're looking at my heart?

625
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,160
you're looking at my...

626
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,820
actual heart?

627
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:14,780
Better than that,mr.Arnold,we're fixing it.

628
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:24,150
and,uh,all-- all those people,uh,up there in the observation deck,they're

629
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,770
--they're,uh,looking at it,too?

630
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,420
they are.

631
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,170
People watching me.

632
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:38,420
Pe-people watching me instead of,uh...

633
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:43,570
it's--it's so weird,uh,to be the one ing watched.

634
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,320
It--it's so weird.

635
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,880
How you doing there,mr.Arnold?

636
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,980
You need anything?

637
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,660
Uh,uh,it's--it's cold,uh,co-cold in here.

638
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,860
Uh,I-I need to cover up.

639
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,150
Uh,uh,c-cover me up.

640
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,850
Uh,okay?

641
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,630
Um,cov-cover me up.

642
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,260
C-cov-cover me up.

643
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:04,680
yeah,we're gonna-- we're--we're gonna coveryour legs with more blankets right now.

644
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Oh,c-cov-cover me up.

645
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,990
Okay?

646
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:09,560
Okay,cov-- cover me up.

647
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,770
His heart rate's up to 168.

648
00:36:10,810 --> 00:36:12,240
Damn it.

649
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:17,510
You know,uh,ev-everybody's watching,uh,and--and,uh,I-I need to be covered up.

650
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,140
I-i need-- I-I can't stay like this.

651
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,740
I can't stay like this.

652
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:24,320
You need--need-- I-I can' I can'T.

653
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,680
No,stop right now.

654
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,030
Just--just stop the surgery.

655
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,210
Stop!Stop it!

656
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:35,530
D/6 okay,I-I mean it.

657
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:36,890
Get your hands out of me.

658
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,420
Please stop!

659
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:43,340
Mr.Arnold,I need you to calm down so that your heart can calm down.

660
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,750
Okay,hey,mr.Arnold.

661
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:47,610
Mr.Arnold) oh.

662
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:49,410
Look at me.

663
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,880
Good.Okay.

664
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:54,600
Now I want you to focus on-- on the observation deck,okay?

665
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,350
Pretend that it's a tree line or a shoreline or something-- something with birds.

666
00:36:58,390 --> 00:37:02,270
Those aren't people up there watching you,those are birds-- your birds-- and you're watching them.

667
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,980
So tell me,mr.Arnold,about the birds.

668
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:05,240
Tell me.Tell me about the birds.

669
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,040
I-I can'T.

670
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,630
You can.

671
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,880
How about her?

672
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,710
That woman in--in the far left?

673
00:37:11,770 --> 00:37:13,620
What kind of bird would she be?

674
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:19,990
Okay,okay,uh,uh,I guess,um,uh,she--she has a long neck.

675
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:24,360
Uh,so she'd-- she'd be an ibis,s-some kind of ibis.

676
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,800
Okay,good.Great.Great.

677
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,220
who's next?

678
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,930
Uh,okay.

679
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,870
th-that one,uh,doing--doing that little,uh,dance with her fingers.

680
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:38,390
Um,she's A...

681
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:41,890
she-- she's the purple sandpiper.

682
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:46,600
uh,yeah,th-those are tough little birds.

683
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:48,510
Those are survivors.

684
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:57,560
and,um,and him,uh,with the,uh,the--the sad eyes,uh-huh,he would--

685
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:04,780
he's a,uh,a-a thrush,a-a black-headed nightingale thrush.

686
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:11,950
and--and the tall one standing there,uh,

687
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:17,210
watching over everything,over,uh,everyone--

688
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:20,340
uhuh,he doesn'tiss a thing.

689
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:23,530
He's A...

690
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:27,170
a great blue heron.

691
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:32,320
No question.

692
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,800
hey,how's,uh,how's,uh,how's your bride?

693
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:49,070
Did she,uh,pull through okay?

694
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,050
Please tell me that you let go first.

695
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:53,940
I absolutely cannot handle my bride winning that way.

696
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:00,380
What?

697
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,490
Oh,nothing.Just,uh...

698
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,050
I just didn't know if we-- we'd ever be able to...

699
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:08,200
talk again.

700
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,240
I'm letting go.

701
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,990
I have to...

702
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,600
let go.

703
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:30,160
Why didn't you tell anybody you were hurting?

704
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:32,600
You would've made me let go.

705
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,520
Hell yeah,I would've.

706
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,090
I guess I lost anyway.

707
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:41,260
No,actually,I let go first.

708
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,310
You did?

709
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:46,310
Someone had to catch you.

710
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,810
D.

711
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:52,490
Have a nice life.

712
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,450
we won.

713
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,500
oh,my god.I can't believe I'm crying over this.

714
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,210
we did this.

715
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:05,790
We actually did this.

716
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:08,750
No,sweetie,you did it.

717
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:11,350
This was all you.

718
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:21,230
I know this sounds ridiculous,but I'm a little disappointed.

719
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:25,790
I mean,I survived a 12,000-foot freefall,and this is gonna be my only scar?

720
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,920
It goes away.

721
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,430
The scar?

722
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,730
The feeling.

723
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:36,140
That feeling that you have right now,today,

724
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:39,840
that feeling like you can do anything,

725
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,700
that clarity,it goes away.

726
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:49,850
And you go right back to being the coward who can't tell the person you love how you feel.

727
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,430
I saw your video.

728
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:56,720
Y-you saw the...

729
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,360
But you're not gonna let sally see it,right?

730
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,590
Y-you're n gonna let her know what I said?

731
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,150
like I saiD...

732
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:09,080
it goes away.

733
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,700
It's going away right now.

734
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:15,270
You have to tell her how you feel,right now while you still can.

735
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:20,660
She is just so incredible,I mean,at everything she does.

736
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,590
She's way out of my league.You don't understand.

737
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,590
There is no way that she could possibly feel the same way that--

738
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:29,210
well,if she doesn't feel the same way,then you move on.

739
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,510
But if you never find out how she feels,

740
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,810
then that won't be your only scar.

741
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:47,320
He doesn't have any secret fetishes,right?

742
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,970
He really-- he doesn't strike me as a fetish kind of guy.

743
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:54,370
Hey,richard,you gotta tell us what this evening is about.

744
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:57,600
You've been obtuse,it's been fun but,you know,we're getting a little freaked out now.

745
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,540
What's a gentlemen's evening?

746
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:03,580
It's an evening with no ladies,just gentlemen.

747
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,320
That's it?

748
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,030
pretty boys living in the woods.

749
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,250
This is very charming.

750
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:12,230
Or sad.

751
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:13,770
I'm not sure which.

752
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,710
What happened to no ladies?

753
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,280
Plans change.

754
00:42:20,690 --> 00:42:22,440
What are you doing tonight?

755
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,360
As in,uh...

756
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:29,590
what are you doing tonight?

757
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,220
Look,uh...

758
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,670
I'm not a nice guy.

759
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,660
I don't date.I don't call the next day.

760
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:41,850
I--I'm not looking for a relationship 'cause I'm never good at 'em.

761
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,950
And honestly,I'm kinda hung up on somebody else.So...

762
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,580
the only thing you're ever gonna get from me is sex.That's it.

763
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:51,630
And,uh,that's never enough for girls like you.

764
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,600
Deep down,everyone wants to believe they c be hard-core.

765
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,130
But being hard-core isn't just about being tough.

766
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,390
Oh,this is just unfair!

767
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,970
In your face,banker.Park place is mine.

768
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,030
Give it up.

769
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:07,940
Come on.

770
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:10,300
yeah,oh,with a hotel!

771
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,610
I think you owe him money.

772
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:13,590
It's about acceptance.

773
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,650
George.

774
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:30,830
I'm exhausted.

775
00:43:31,530 --> 00:43:33,190
Every bone...

776
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,880
and every muscle in my body...

777
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,710
aches.

778
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,910
And I don't think I can do this.

779
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,170
I don't-- it's not that I don't want to,because I do.

780
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,010
I really,really do.

781
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:49,780
It's just that I-I just spent six and a half hours on my feet in surgery,

782
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:53,400
and I can barely hold myself up,and I'm just so tired.

783
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,730
this is--this is like a-- a rare bird,george.

784
00:43:57,790 --> 00:44:01,110
You know,I mean,the first time that we're together since--

785
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:05,280
since we were together,and it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

786
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,680
I don't want to waste it.I don't want to waste it on a night

787
00:44:07,740 --> 00:44:12,300
that I'm too exhausted to enjoy it because I want to enjoy our rare bird,george.

788
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,810
I need to enjoy our rare bird.

789
00:44:15,570 --> 00:44:17,830
me,too.I...

790
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:23,840
and oh,my hand is jus oh,it's just killing me from holding that dress.

791
00:44:24,850 --> 00:44:29,880
S-so maybe to-- maybe tonight's not the perfect night.

792
00:44:29,950 --> 00:44:32,290
Maybe a perfect night is...

793
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,720
another night.

794
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,500
Really?

795
00:44:44,310 --> 00:44:47,030
Do you want to maybe,uh...

796
00:44:47,750 --> 00:44:49,750
go to sleep?

797
00:44:56,870 --> 00:44:58,570
Oh,thanks.

798
00:44:58,650 --> 00:45:00,200
Okay.

799
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,460
Did you only shave one of your legs?

800
00:45:09,930 --> 00:45:12,570
I know.I'm sorry.

801
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:13,670
No,no,I was just wondering.It's cool.

802
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:15,650
It's--it's okay.Sorry.

803
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:19,060
It's--it's-- oh,my god.I can't do it.

804
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:24,190
Sometimes you have to give yourself permission to not be hard-core for once.

805
00:45:24,270 --> 00:45:25,690
Maybe I should take a sleeping pill.

806
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:27,350
Oh,no.Don't do that.

807
00:45:27,410 --> 00:45:30,960
You'll just get strung out and turn into a bad afterschool special.

808
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:34,450
We'll just sleep,and...you'll slP.

809
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:39,300
I can't stop,cristina.

810
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:43,490
I just can't stop seeing derek.

811
00:45:45,820 --> 00:45:48,990
And it's not about the sex.It's not...

812
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:51,860
about the sex.

813
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:54,700
It's about that moment afterward...

814
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,230
when the world stops.

815
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,060
It just feels so safe...

816
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:08,510
so safe.

817
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:12,420
I'm not ready to give that up.

818
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:18,390
Does that make me sad and weak and pathetic?

819
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,560
A little bit.

820
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,580
What do I do?

821
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:31,810
I don't know.

822
00:46:31,850 --> 00:46:35,280
You don't have to be tough every minute of every day.

823
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,640
It's okay to let down your guard.

824
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:42,320
In fact,there are moments when it's the best thing you could possibly do...

825
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:54,480
as long as you choose your moments wisely.

826
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:06,630
alex,please tell me that you don't live with meredith grey.
