1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,120
Previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:03,880
there's nothing sexual
between you and georgie?

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,770
Mom!

4
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:07,120
Don't you dare come to me for
forgiveness,you traitorous bitch.

5
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:08,320
Our marriage is falling apart.

6
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,390
You're never here.

7
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:11,170
dr.Hahn-- I have
a thing for her.

8
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:12,480
it's gonna end badly.

9
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:13,760
You know what?Cardio is my thing.

10
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,640
You are flirting with cardio.

11
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:17,440
I am married to cardio.

12
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,910
Yeah,but what if,while I'm waiting,

13
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,250
I meet someone who is ready to
give me what I want from you?

14
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,420
Are we friends yet?

15
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,480
-I'm sorry?
-Are we friends?

16
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,000
I don't want you to date other people.

17
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:26,950
I don't want you to date anybody but me.

18
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,270
in the beginning,god created
the heaven and the earth.

19
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:33,960
At least,that's what they say.

20
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:36,850
He created the birds of the
air and the beasts of the field,

21
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,680
and he looked at his creation
and he saw that it was good.

22
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:44,940
And then god created man,and
it's been downhill ever since.

23
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,470
The woman loves me.

24
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:47,600
Erica hahn?

25
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:48,530
I'm telling you.

26
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,910
We went out last
night,had a couple drinks.

27
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,890
You and erica?

28
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,440
Just me and hahn.

29
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,010
And callie.

30
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,740
oh,all right.So it wasn't a date.

31
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:58,670
xxxxxxx

32
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,170
Why does it always have
to be about the destination?

33
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:02,530
Why can't it be about the journey?

34
00:01:02,590 --> 00:01:04,780
'Cause I'm wearing $300 shoes.

35
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,340
Meredith told me she doesn't
want me seeing other people.

36
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,760
She found out about you and rose?

37
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:10,800
No.There's nothing to find
out.It was just a kiss.

38
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:14,420
Yeah,but you're not the kind of guy who
makes out with nurses in scrub rooms.

39
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,030
Not that there's
anything wrong with that.

40
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:17,020
What do you think?

41
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:18,260
I think it was more than just a kiss.

42
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,730
No,no,no,no,the view.

43
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,490
Well,what am I looking at?

44
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:25,060
The view from my new house.

45
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,470
the story goes on to say that
god created man in his own image,

46
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,410
but there's not much proof of that.

47
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:40,760
After all,god made the sun and the moon and
the stars,and all man makes is trouble...

48
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,060
it's a classic victorian
design with an open floor plan.

49
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,770
What are you doing?

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,450
I'm making an omelet.

51
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,010
What do you think of the house?

52
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:52,300
The house.I think the house is great.

53
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:55,390
Well,if you don't like,you know,you
can tell me.It's your house,too.

54
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,840
Damn.

55
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:00,900
so why are you cooking again?

56
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:03,890
Lexie,uh,was having a bad night,.

57
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:06,930
and I thought I would do
something semi-sisterly

58
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,650
Really?

59
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,020
Really.

60
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,730
are you getting up?

61
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,990
No.

62
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,280
Maybe.

63
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,710
I don't know.

64
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,020
What's thasmell?

65
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:23,980
Someone's cooking.

66
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,030
That's not cooking.

67
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,190
That...

68
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,280
that's not cooking.

69
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,760
You're gonna be
late.You know that,right?

70
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,090
I hate work.

71
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,200
Since when? -Since I hate it.

72
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,240
I hate cristina.I hate hahn.I hate it.

73
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,390
Oh,what is that smell?

74
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,330
That smells like sulfur.

75
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,310
breakfast.

76
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,470
Oh,it's breakfast.

77
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,120
no!

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,430
Don't go.Don't go. -I have to go.

79
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:51,180
She made breakfast.I'm going.

80
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,320
Now stop.off.

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,450
Where's your girlfriend?

82
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:03,000
Back with her husband,I'm guessing.

83
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,360
And I don't have a girlfriend.

84
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,810
Or a conscience,apparently.

85
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,770
Yeah,but you knew that going in.

86
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:10,460
I'm not saying we have to build
it now,but we have to plan it now.

87
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,280
Dude,what the hell is that?

88
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,440
Meredith cooked.

89
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,910
She wanted to do something ce for lexie.

90
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:15,860
You cooked for me?

91
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,790
It's no big deal.

92
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:21,650
Just eggs and avocado and whatever
cheese that was in the fridge.

93
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:24,500
Oh,I love,um,avocados.

94
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,980
Is it okay?

95
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,210
Okay,honey.

96
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,400
Okay.

97
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:41,590
This little man has
been fed and changed.

98
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:42,690
There we go.

99
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:46,240
Oh,I put the ilding
manager's number on my desk.

100
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:50,440
Do not believe him when he tells
you that he can fix the sink.

101
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,750
Remind him he is the one that broke
it when he tried to fix the pipes.

102
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,540
Miranda.

103
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,910
Oh,oh,you're talking to me now?

104
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,320
Now that I'm my way out the door?

105
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,780
-You're always on your
way out the door. -Tucker--

106
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,830
no,are you interested in being a
part of this family or not?Because--

107
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:11,250
okay,I can't do this,uh,now.

108
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,160
I-I don't have time.

109
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,600
oh,dr.Toes.

110
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:23,900
Dr.Hahn,anyone who can outdrink me and still kick
my ass at the dartboard gets to call me callie.

111
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,810
Last night was actually fun,wasn't it?

112
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,370
And I'm not a group person.

113
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,370
Mm,me neither.

114
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,400
I think it's because i
generally don't like people.

115
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:35,080
Me neither.

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,510
morning,ladies.

117
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,260
Case in point.

118
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,820
what's so funny?

119
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,150
And when man finds himself in
trouble,which is most of the time,

120
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,510
he turns to something
bigger than himself--

121
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:56,930
to love or fate or religion--
to make sense of it all.

122
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,180
Sweet tart?

123
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,990
Do you ever eat anything that
even remotely resembles real food?

124
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,130
You'll have to take me
to dinner to find out.

125
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,680
I can't do that.

126
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:07,620
That,uh,kiss was...

127
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,360
unexpected.

128
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,620
I like kissing you.

129
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,370
I enjoyed kissing
you,but,uh,I'm seeing somebody.

130
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,980
Meredith grey.

131
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,160
Everybody knows about
you and meredith grey.

132
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,140
I have to see it through.I'm sorry.

133
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,170
Don't be.

134
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:22,670
It was just a kiss.

135
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,740
See you in surgery,dr.Shepherd.

136
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,050
But for a surgeon,the only thing
that makes any kind of sense is...

137
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,490
medicine.

138
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,380
Yes.

139
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,290
Oh,I--back
off.

140
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,970
Elizabeth archer is my patient.

141
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:39,150
Technically,she's hahn's
patient,but whatever.

142
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,920
Um,I'm scrubbing in on a major
coronary artery dissection with hahn,

143
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,430
and what,you're not
gonna fight me for it?

144
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,330
I'm not doing the cardio thing anymore.

145
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,720
I am over it.

146
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,410
You're over it?

147
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,880
Uh,why?What do you have?

148
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,400
Nothing.I'm charting.

149
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,180
Stevens,elizabeth's archer's chart.

150
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,370
Yang has it.You two have fun.

151
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,220
She's not a cardiothoracic
surgeon,but I could've told you that.

152
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,250
I am the rock star.

153
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,550
Karev,are you a rock star?

154
00:06:07,610 --> 00:06:08,600
Always.

155
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,940
You're with me today.

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,420
Congratulations.Your life
just got more interesting.

157
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,300
Karev doesn't know anything
about elizabeth archer.

158
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,010
You can read,can't you,dr.Karev?

159
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,640
Uh,yes.

160
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,540
Elizabeth archer,49,came into the
E.R.Yesterday complaining of severe,persistent--

161
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,370
an urgent cardiac cath demonstrated dissection
of the proximal two-thirds of the L.A.D.

162
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,960
She was admitted last
night for observation.

163
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,170
While I admire your preparation,dr.Yang,

164
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,270
there is one thing about the
patient you failed to notice.

165
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,210
She's gone.

166
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,660
Callie.

167
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,610
Mrs.O'malley,hi.

168
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,930
How have you been?

169
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,920
Well,I've been worried is how I've been.

170
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,860
I--I've called,and
I left messages.

171
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,980
I know how busy u two are,but you
can't pick up the phone once in a while?

172
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,960
I...I--
never mind.

173
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,300
Water under the bridge.

174
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,060
I was in the neighborhood,and
I hope you don't mind,

175
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:04,850
but I just couldn't wait to show you
some of the outfits I've been making.

176
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:05,980
Out-outfits?

177
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:09,640
Now don't get mad,but georgie
told me you were trying,so...

178
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,680
what do you think?

179
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,100
It's yellow.

180
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,860
I see that.

181
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,570
Dr.Bailey.

182
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,060
Whatever it is,I don't have time.

183
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,460
Um,I think I need some epinephrine.

184
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,420
tucker,now's not a good
time for--epinephrine?

185
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,310
Uh,the cart's around the
corneR.Can you give her the...

186
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,410
Thank you.

187
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:34,570
No,I told you,I put it on my desk.

188
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,940
uh,I have to call you back.

189
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,510
you're gonna have to step
back from the patient,ma'am.

190
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,580
ma'am?

191
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,910
Just one second.

192
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,520
Ms.Archer?Uh,what is she doing here?

193
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,000
I have no idea.Who is she?

194
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,700
She's hahn's patient.Ms.Archer,uh,you
need to get back to your bed.

195
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,050
there.

196
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,150
What'd you do to him?He
was in v-tach and now...

197
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,220
I-I healed him.

198
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,350
I'm a healer.

202
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,330
You're a faith healer?

203
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,710
I'm a healer,and I have faith,but
I'm not sure the two are reted.

204
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,210
ms.Archer,you collapsed.

205
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:26,410
You could go into cardiac
arrest at any moment.

206
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:30,430
So I'm less interested in what you do for
a living than I am with getting you into--

207
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,570
well,wait.I want to know
what she did to mr.Greenwald.

208
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,330
I mean,he's been in and out of
v-tach all day,and now he's stable.

209
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,490
Maybe because of the
amiodarone he got two hours ago.

210
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,580
Really?

211
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:43,040
Does amiodarone usually
take two hours to kick in?

212
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:46,760
Ms.Archer,you have a
coronary artery dissection.

213
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,930
Dr.Karev and I need to get you
into surgery as soon as possible.

214
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,440
I appreciate that,dr.Hahn,

215
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,240
but I am not going into surgery until
we've exhausted all the other possibilities.

216
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,630
Ms.Arc.her,if you don't
have the surgery soon,

217
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,090
I can guarantee you that the blood
supply to your heart will be cut off,

218
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,080
and I'll have to open you up anyway.

219
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,060
All I'm asking for is that you give me
some time and talk me through the surgery

220
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,590
that you'd like to perform so that I
may visualize it while I do what I do.

221
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:17,360
And if it doesn't work,then
you can slice me open,okay?

222
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:23,880
Dr.Karev can work with you
doing whatever it is that you do.

223
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,150
I'll check in soon.

224
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,390
Call me when she codes.

225
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,340
Hey,what are you looking for?

226
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,120
Epinephrine.I need epinephrine.

227
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,760
Why?

228
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,990
Oh,what happened to you?

229
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,950
I'm an adult child of an
alcoholic is what happened to me.

230
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:43,130
I have boundary issues.

231
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:45,510
So when meredith made me eggs this
morning,I couldn't not eat them.

232
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:47,900
I had to pretend I
wasn't allergic to eggs.

233
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,900
And now I have a rash
covering my entire body.

234
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,980
Give me your arm.

235
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:53,300
I'm codependent,my
throat is closing up--.

236
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:56,810
and now my arm hurts

237
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,400
thanks.

238
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,300
You're welcome.

239
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:01,580
And thank you for leing me
crash on your couch last night.

240
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,420
You didn't tell your
mom that we broke up?

241
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,110
What?

242
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,810
Your mom is making us baby clothes

243
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:08,820
because she thinks we're still trying to get
pregnant because she thinks we're still married

244
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,610
because she thinks you're still the kind
of person who would never cheat on his wife-

245
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:13,840
- hand
-stitched unisex baby clothes.

246
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,770
They're yellow and green
and go up to toddler sizes.

247
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:20,560
And she's waiting for you in the lobby.

248
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:25,840
So you never really told me
what you thought of the house.

249
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,150
I have a house.

250
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,110
Well,that's your house.I'm
talking about our house.

251
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,700
Between yesterday and
today u had plans drawn up?

252
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,960
No,I've had the plans for months.

253
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,420
Between yesterday and today,i
decided to share them with you.

254
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,030
Why?

255
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,800
so nothing's really changed,has it?

256
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,570
Everything's the same as it was.

257
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:46,060
No,it's just--it's really
a lot,and it's fast.

258
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,870
Right.Well,I'm just trying
to take a step forward.

259
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,380
Okay,well,there are about 100
steps between where we are right now

260
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,890
and building our dream house.

261
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:55,660
And they'll be fun steps and sexy steps,

262
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,080
and we'll try not to fall
down them together.Okay?

263
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,680
Okay.

264
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,530
dr.Bailey.

265
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,810

Uh,s--chief.

266
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,490
Yeah,rumor has it dr.Hahn has a
patient who's wandering the halls?

267
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,940
Oh,she's back in her bed,sir.

268
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:14,290
And laying hands on other patients?

269
00:11:14,350 --> 00:11:15,880
It was just one patient.

270
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,490
And healing them?

271
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,470
For which there is a perfectly
reasonable medical explanation.

272
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,420
of course there is,

273
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:26,280
but I can't have a hospital full of sick people
thinking there's a miracle woman on the cardiac ward.

274
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,720
Creates panic and hysteria,and
frankly,it's bad for business.

275
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,870
Are you gonna answer that?

276
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:31,960
No,sir,I'm not.

277
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,660
Are you gonna make sure this
woman keeps her hands to herself?

278
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,960
Ye sir,I am.

279
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,720
Thank you,dr.Bailey.

280
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,390
dr.Sloan,why are you endangering
the life of my patient?

281
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,310
Because your patient had her
hands all over one of my patients.

282
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,530
She had a staph infection.I
was trying to heal her.

283
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,660
Don't worry your pretty little
head about it,sloan.Karev.

284
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,270
Have you noticed that even when you're insulting
me,you manage to tell me how pretty I am?

285
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,830
It wasn't meant as a compliment.

286
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,840
Is this like a gender
reversal thing with you,

287
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,280
where you're the big man on campus

288
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,890
and I'm the hot blond whose
ponytail you can't stop pulling?

289
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,480
Why don't you get that
I just don't like you,

290
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,530
that I think you are a crass,

291
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:16,610
predatory ape of man who just
happens to be a decent surgeon?

292
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,850
You want to heal someone?

293
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,390
Heal her.

294
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,480
This is really toxic in here.Could
somebody take me back to my room?

295
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,370
'Cause my healing team
should be arriving soon.

296
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,830
I'll take you.

297
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,240
mrs.O'malley.

298
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,860
There she is.

299
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,840
Come here.

300
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,090
What are you doing here?Does
george know you're here?

301
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,170
Callie said she'd find him for me.

302
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,480
How are you,dear?

303
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,560
You okay?

304
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:38,300
-You talked to callie?
-Poor thing.

305
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
It's gotta be hard for her,you know?

306
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,310
I mean,you try and you
try,but we're all human.

307
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,540
Nobody's perfect.

308
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,450
And in the end,it's nobody's fault.

309
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,390
I'm so happy to hear you say that.

310
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:51,050
I have just felt so terrible about it.

311
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,440
Oh,I know.Me,toO.

312
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,360
You know,we just...

313
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:55,870
we didn't mean for it to happen.

314
00:12:55,910 --> 00:12:57,910
I know how that sounds,but it's true.

315
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,380
We were...

316
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,790
we were drunk,and it only
happened the one time.

317
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,260
And I know that doesn't ma it right.

318
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,830
But you have to believe me,it was never
my intention to break up george's marriage.

319
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,480
I-I mean,I didn't even know
that I was in love with him.

320
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,190
And george was so distraught about it.

321
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,140
I mean,I think that's why
he failed the intern test.

322
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,190
He wh-what?He failed?

323
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,830
Oh,no.He didn't tell you that part?

324
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,850
He didn't tell me any part.

325
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,550
But you said you--
you talked to callie.

326
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,260
About baby clothes.

327
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,070
I thought she was having
trouble getting pregnant.

328
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,770
I made baby clothes.

329
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,670
Oh,no.

330
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,330
Mom.

331
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:33,210
What?

332
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,700
I'm sorry.

333
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,770
I'm so sorry.I'm
sorry,I'm sorry,I'm sorry.

334
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,740
hey,I-I know I said I'd
call you right back...

335
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,410
tucker,wait,I can't do this right
now.I'm being paged to the E.R.

336
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,170
What do you mean,you're
the one paging me?

337
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:51,530
I-I told you never to page
me at the hospital unless...

338
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,510
there was an accident.

339
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,810
Xxall four limbs are moving.

340
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:12,040
Pupils are responsive and dilating.

341
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,420
There's no neurological damage.

342
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:16,490
Let's get him on a monitor and
where's the x-ray for the auma series?

343
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,130
Order a left forearm with the x-rays.

344
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,410
There's bruising and swelling here.

345
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,470
Mama's right here.Little
man.I'm right here.

346
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,880
he was under a bookshelf?

347
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,880
The whole thing must have
fallen over on top of him.

348
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,240
And all those medical books-- he probably
tried to climb up and pulled it over.

349
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,850
I heard him screaming,and
then I found him.

350
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,750
Tucker,I'm trying to hear.Stop talking.

351
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,360
Miranda,let me do that.

352
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,500
No,no,I got it.I got it.

353
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,890
Miranda. -What?

354
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,180
I-I...

355
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,540
this is why we put the baby
gate in the living room.

356
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,630
The gate was open.

357
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,750
You left the gate open?

358
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,660
No,I didn'T.

359
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,220
What are you trying to
say,I left the gate open?

360
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,230
Accidents happen.

361
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,020
Not if you take the time to
bolt the bookshelves to the wall.

362
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:52,030
I can't baby-proof every inch of that
apartment and watch him at the same time.

363
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,750
Well,you weren't watching him,otherwise
we wouldn't be here right now.

364
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,490
Okay,he's got decreased breath sounds
on the left side,and his abdomen's rigid.

365
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,630
What does all this mean?

366
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,310
It means there may be
some internal injuries.

367
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,230
What kind of injuries?

368
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,500
Tucker,we don't have time for questions.

369
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,970
He needs a full trauma workup.

370
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:07,140
Clear a C.T.And get me
an ultrasound machine.

371
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:11,970
this is not
okay,georgie.This is not okay.

372
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,540
I-I-- you're
planning to what?

373
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,710
You're planning to marry izzie
now?You're planning an annulment?

374
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,200
Okay,this-- this
is not about izzie.

375
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,310
What the hell is it
about?Because thissn't okay.

376
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:21,770
This isn't okay with me.I
raised you better than this.

377
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,260
This is about the fact that I never
should've gotten married in the first place.

378
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,980
But you did.You got
married.You didn't invite me.

379
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,290
You didn't let me plan a
wedding,and I accepted that.

380
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,610
I accepted it because you were
happy,and that's all that mattered,

381
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,480
but this--I won't accept
this.I don't accept this.

382
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,060
Mom. -We're catholic.

383
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:39,010
We don't believe in divorce.And we
certainly don't believe in adultery.

384
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,850
I'm sorry.

385
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,370
Well,don't be sorry to
me.Be sorry to father mike.

386
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:46,610
You call him,he'll hear your confession and
he'll get you and callie into counseling.

387
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:50,240
It's too late for that.
-It is not too late.

388
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:55,100
You made a vow to
callie and a vow to god.

389
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,680
you just don't walk away from that.

390
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,700
This is your soul we're talking about.

391
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,700
I have to go.

392
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,730
No,you will not.

393
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:02,550
You will not walk away
from me,george o'malley.

394
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,040
It's dr.Bailey.

395
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,840
I have to go.

396
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,660
what happened?

397
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,920
He got crushed under a bookshelf.
-Multiple rib fractures.

398
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,080
Might have dropped a lung.

399
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,440
They're worried there may
be damage to the heart.

400
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:23,990
Okay,yang and stevens,get him to radiology
for a head,chest and abdominal C.T.

401
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:25,790
O'malley,tell the lab to move fast.

402
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,500
Karev,clear out.We'll keep you posted.

403
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,540
I want you to stay with dr.Bailey.

404
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,100
She's pretty worked up,and I want to make sure
that doesn't get in the way of the baby's care.

405
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,370
I don't need a babysitter.

406
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,910
I know you don'T.

407
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,630
you stay with her.

408
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,930
I'm sorry about that.

409
00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,240
Uh,there was an emergency.

410
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,480
Dr.Karev,this is don and mai.

411
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,580
Nice to meet you.

412
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,880
He's a skeptic.He shouldn't be here.

413
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,040
Is dr.Hahn coming?

414
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:57,250
Dr.Hahn's been called into an emergency surgery,so
she asked me to talk you through the procedure.

415
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:58,470
Is she gonna be long?

416
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,770
Well,I'm hoping she's done before your
heart blows,but I can't makeany promises.

417
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,170
I told you he shouldn't be here.

418
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,260
I need someone who knows what they're
doing to talk me through the surgery.

419
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,480
This...

420
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,380
this,it's--it's
crap.

421
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,910
You're
stalling.You're--you're scared.

422
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:13,320
Of course I'm scared.

423
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,800
Surgery is...

424
00:17:14,850 --> 00:17:16,010
it's barbaric.

425
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:18,750
You tear flesh and spill blood.

426
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:21,400
I-I work with light.I work with energy.

427
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,120
I visualize healing.

428
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,700
And if there's even the slightest chance
that what I do works,isn't that preferable?

429
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,150
I don't believe in what you do.

430
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:29,710
Well,I'm not asking you to.

431
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:32,270
I'm asking you to help me to do it.

432
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,850
Can you imagine how
horrible this is for her?

433
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:39,100
This is why people should not have kids.

434
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,330
What is the matter with
you?That's bailey's baby in there.

435
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,110
No,see,no.It's a trauma case.

436
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,050
If we are gonna be at all
effective in saving that kid's life,

437
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:50,190
it can't be bailey's
baby.He's a blunt trauma case.

438
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,260
you and hahn are exactly alike.The
two of you deserve each other.

439
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,300
Thank you.

440
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,300
I thought you loved
cardio. -Oh,no,no,no,no.

441
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,540
She's pretending not to anymore.

442
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,520
Can't take the pressure,huh,iz?

443
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,810
You're right,cristina.

444
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:04,430
In the contest to see who
can be the best robot,you win.

445
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,740
tell me again how this happened.

446
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:19,630
You didn't understand me the first time?

447
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:20,740
Just--just
tell me again.

448
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,370
Somebody left the baby gatopen.

449
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,610
Somebody.

450
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:25,480
And you...

451
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,680
you're--you're saying
you think I did this?

452
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,170
I'm saying that you were in such a
hurry to get out the house this morning,

453
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:36,000
that you were in such a hurry to--to
get to work and get away from me--

454
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,350
oh,tucker,this doesn't
have anything to do with--

455
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:40,430
why do you think he even
went into that room,huh?

456
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,360
You the only one ever goes in there.

457
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,580
He went looking for his mama.

458
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,040
He went looking for his mama
and wound up in the hospital.

459
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,330
Guess you made a bad choice,huh,tucker?

460
00:18:57,790 --> 00:19:00,240
You picked a bad wife,

461
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,910
she made a bad mother,she
made you stay home,

462
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,690
raise your son,and then
she almost killed him.

463
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:10,100
Poor you,huh?

464
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,840
I heard about dr.Bailey's
son.How bad is it?

465
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,910
Well, we're still
waiting on his studies.

466
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,760
Derek?

467
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,770
Remember before when I was unbelievably cool
and let you off e hook for making out with me?

468
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,530
- Well, now I'm angry.
- Why?

469
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:32,500
Because you're not making
eye contact with me.

470
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:36,930
Because we are standing here talking about
bailey's baby, and you won't look at me.

471
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,270
- Sorry.
- Better.

472
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,370
Now it was one kiss, okay?

473
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:48,110
It was a good kiss, maybe even a great one,
but are we going to let one maybe-great kiss

474
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,830
get in the way of what, up until now, has
been a really great professional relationship

475
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:53,250
even though you didn't
know my name until recently?

476
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,260
No, we are not.

477
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,850
So...

478
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,950
friends?

479
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,990
Friends.

480
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,040
Good.

481
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:08,400
Bailey wants to know if
tuck's films are ready.

482
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,140
What...is that?What's that
shadow?Where's his heart?

483
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,260
- You can't see it because-
- his stomach's in his chest.

484
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,060
There's visceral herniation,
a positive collar sign.

485
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,930
which indicates a diaphragmatic hernia.

486
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:24,400
It's a ruptured diaphragm, which
is the least of his problems,

487
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:28,630
'cause the force of the trauma
injured his thoracic aorta.

488
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,410
You see this, in the chest
cavity next to the stomach?

489
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,080
That's colon.

490
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:37,460
And around the colon is fluid, which
could mean the colon is ruptured

491
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:42,110
and there's fecal matter floating around
that could infect the aortic repair,

492
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,120
and that complication can be fatal.

493
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,850
What are y'all standing around for?

494
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:53,440
Uh, page hahn and the chief.Book an O.R.

495
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,080
Okay, they repaired the
hole in the diaphragm,

496
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,410
and dr.Hahn is just about
to inspect the mediastinum.

497
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:05,180
Okay, is she gonna repair with
sutures or prosthetic graft?

498
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:06,700
- Don't know.
- Don't know?

499
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:08,670
She didn't say.

500
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,220
Dr.Bailey.

501
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:14,120
Dr.Bailey, are you kidding?

502
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,820
I need to be with my son.

503
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,960
- Miranda- - I have no
intention of getting in the way.

504
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,580
I just--I can't stand
out there.I can'T.

505
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:22,360
I need to be with my son.

506
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:26,330
And what we need, dr.Bailey, is
to not have our patient's mother

507
00:21:26,370 --> 00:21:28,710
watching us perform his surgery.

508
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:31,490
Dr.Grey, please escort
dr.Bailey back outside.

509
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,000
No.There will be no escorting of ...

510
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,800
Bailey anywhere, dr.Grey.

511
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,350
You can proceed.

512
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,910
I will not proceed
until you leave this O.R.

513
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:42,310
Now do you want me to
stand here talking to you,

514
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:45,630
or do you want me to try
and save your baby's life?

515
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,800
Miranda.

516
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,350
I just want to hold my son's hand.

517
00:21:53,390 --> 00:21:55,660
I just want to hold his hand.Please.

518
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,200
I'll--I'll
hold his hand.

519
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,490
Dr.Grey can hold this retractor, right?

520
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,620
Yes.

521
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:06,360
I'll hold tuck's hand, dr.Bailey,
if it's-- if it's okay with you.

522
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:09,310
I'll hold-- I'll
hold his hand.

523
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,090
okay, everybody, let's get back to work.

524
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:39,080
Mrs.O'malley.What
are you--

525
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,390
I-I couldn't leave.

526
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:46,350
When harold was here, when he was sick,
dr.Bailey took such good d care of him.

527
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:52,510
I couldn't leave knowing her son was in
trouble, knowing both our sons are in trouble.

528
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,370
Mrs.O'malley,
I just--

529
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,260
I know you think m
old-fashioned, and maybe I am.

530
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,680
But it doesn't matter what I think.

531
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:05,810
In god's eyes, marriage is forever.

532
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,550
Well, if it's any consolation,

533
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,280
george and I got married on the vegas
strip at a 24-hour church of elvis.

534
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,590
I'm not sure god was even there.

535
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,230
He's everywhere.

536
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,730
I used to believe in god...

537
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:26,340
and marriage...and heaven and hell.

538
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,400
But you don't anymore?

539
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,210
I believe in love...

540
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,080
and second chances...

541
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,950
and that even though george
wasn't the one for me,

542
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,130
it was okay that I believed
that he was because...

543
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:50,890
well, for a little while, at least...

544
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:53,610
I got to be an o'malley.

545
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,370
And I really loved being an o'malley.

546
00:24:08,170 --> 00:24:09,570
He's back.

547
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,430
I'm sorry to interrupt, but your,

548
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:14,640
uh, most recent echo shows
the dissection is extending.

549
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,590
You need to let me prep you for surgery.

550
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:20,260
Oh, no.No, not yet.We
haven't finished our work.

551
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,770
You're gonna die.

552
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:25,060
Do you know how mai knew you were
back, even with her eyes closed?

553
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,260
Uh, she heard me?

554
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,700
She felt you.

555
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:30,500
It's like a--like a
pull, like a darkness.

556
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,890
Right, right.I'm--I'm
the angel of death.Got it.

557
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:36,750
No.You're not the angel
of death, dr.Karev.

558
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:39,250
You're--you're actually
a very sweet boy.

559
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:41,450
He's got a beautiful heart,
wouldn't you say, mai?

560
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,300
I would, but his gut and his throat...

561
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,140
they're blocked.

562
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,480
Second chakra's worse.

563
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,640
Seriously?You're talking about chakra?

564
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,480
We're talking about how you've got
a darkness at your throat chakra,

565
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,150
where your voice should be because
whater happened to you was so,

566
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,140
so ugly and went on for so long
that you don't talk about it.

567
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,190
You were hurt so badly that sometimes
you want to hurt other people just to

568
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:07,140
-
- just to spread it around.

569
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:15,080
You were a good boy, dr.Karev, a good,
sweet boy, but you're not a very good man.

570
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,870
What happened to you?

571
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,370
Your artery is shredding.

572
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,000
You need surgery.

573
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,570
I'm not a very good man,
but I do tell the truth.

574
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,240
And the truth is, if you don't get
this surgery fast, you're gonna die.

575
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,860
...I left it on the desk.

576
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:44,340
I was in a hurry, so I looked at the
clock and I walked out of the door.

577
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:47,890
- I...the gate.
- Miranda, this isn't helpg.

578
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:50,860
The gate was open.Did I close the gate?

579
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,540
Okay, look, I walked out of the bedroom
into the office, and I wrote a note

580
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:56,250
-- this isn't--
this isn't helping.

581
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,450
- I can't remember.
- Stop this.This is not helping.

582
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,230
I can't remember if I closed that gate.

583
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,980
That's my baby, that's my baby, and
I can't remember if closed the gate.

584
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,430
-It doesn't matter.It does not matter.
- It does matter!

585
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,690
It matters because I'm his mother,
and I can't have done this to him.

586
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:08,740
I can't have hurt him this badly.

587
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,330
- You didn't do this.
- Things just happen.

588
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,690
No, they don't just happen.

589
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,430
Things don't just happen.

590
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,400
People make decisions.

591
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,990
People prioritize.

592
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,150
Okay, the world just doesn't happen!

593
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,620
Okay, it's not on god.

594
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,780
It'sn me or it's on tucker!

595
00:26:22,810 --> 00:26:23,840
Stop it!Stop.Stop.

596
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:26,230
- It's on me!
- No, stop it.

597
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:31,350
just...just stop it.

598
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,940
you're a good mother.

599
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,250
Tucker is a good father.

600
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,880
You love your baby.

601
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:40,420
People make mistakes.

602
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:46,200
You didn't do this to your son,
and neither did your husband.

603
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:57,650
he wants to build us a house, with
kids' bedrooms and french doors,

604
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,230
and that scares me to death.

605
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,720
Why?Just 'cause of the rose thing?

606
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:05,680
Well, that shouldn't scare
you.It was just one kiss.

607
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,060
One kiss?

608
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,690
Yeah, I w--I wasn't
eavesdropping.

609
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,310
It wasn't like they were
being secretive about it.

610
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,160
It was just something that happened.

611
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,630
Now that you guys are back together,
it's not happening anymore, so...

612
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,090
derek kissed rose?

613
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:19,700
Yeah, but you knew tha.

614
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:26,830
that I'm an idiot.

615
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,230
Okay, the stomach's repaired.

616
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,160
There's no splenic laceration.

617
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:37,730
Now all I have to do is get the
chest tube in, and we're done.

618
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,730
That's good, tuck.

619
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,190
That means you're in better
shape than we thought.

620
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:44,770
That means you're almost outta here.

621
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:47,910
Dr.Yang, would you
like to do the honors?

622
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:52,230
I can trade places
with you if you'd like.

623
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,210
Uh, no.I'm okay.I'm okay here.

624
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,770
Both of which we repaired,
so the surgery was a success.

625
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,150
However, there is a lot of fluid in
the chest cavity, so at this point,

626
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:13,050
we have no way of knowing whether he'll
be able to breathe on his own anytime soon.

627
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:14,220
I know that.

628
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,740
You don't think I know that?

629
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:19,070
Uh, we'll be moving him
to the pediatric I.C.U.

630
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,700
We'll be watching him closely.

631
00:28:20,730 --> 00:28:22,060
Can I see my son now?

632
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,880
Absolutely.

633
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,810
Uh, you're new here.

634
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,000
You don't know me.

635
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,860
And if what you did today ends up saving
my son's life, I'll thank you for it.

636
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:43,500
But if I never have to look at you again
after that, that'll be all right with me.

637
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,640
We never baptized him.

638
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:02,980
We kept putting it off, thinking we
were gonna find time, and--and now...

639
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:06,490
we will find the time.

640
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:11,360
When this is over and tuck is fine...

641
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:18,430
you and i are gonna find time,
and we are gonna baptize our baby.

642
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,830
How's tuck?

643
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,420
Oh, he's still not breathing on his own.

644
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,030
You know, I wish I could help, but
I can't think of anything I can do.

645
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,360
Cristina always knows what to do.

646
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,690
What's your deal with her?With yang?

647
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:04,950
Nothing.There's no deal.I don'T...

648
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,330
I'm crippled with envy.

649
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,990
Of yang?

650
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,190
'Cause she's better at cardio than you?

651
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,690
She's not better than me.

652
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,300
She just...

653
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:17,550
she knows what she wants.

654
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,640
She has this faith in her skill,
in herself, in her future in cardio.

655
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,330
It's an unwavering faith.

656
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:29,390
She knows who she is, and I want that.

657
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,290
I was chasing cardio
because I want what she has.

658
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,540
She's a robot.

659
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,920
Not the robot part.

660
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,610
The--the
faith part.

661
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:41,780
I want that.

662
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:04,160
There's probably a
thousand scientific reasons

663
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,470
why mr.Greenwald's heart
rate just suddenly stabilized.

664
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,850
Without question.

665
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:15,710
And why mrs.Mccaffrey's staph
infection just suddenly disappeared.

666
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,520
Sloan's patient?She's fine?

667
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:24,570
I mean, don't get me
wrong, I have faith.I do.

668
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:29,680
But faith isn't medicine.

669
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,340
Faith...can't heal you.

670
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,570
Well, that may be so.

671
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:40,260
But then again...

672
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,940
it can't hurt.

673
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,810
- hey.
- hey!

674
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,940
How's tuck?

675
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:54,830
He's intubated, and, uh, we won't
know anything for a few hours.

676
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:56,760
How are you holding up?

677
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,070
Who's rose?

678
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:04,250
rose is a circulating nurse.

679
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:06,100
I kissed her once.I'm
sure you know that.

680
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,240
That's why you're asking me.

681
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,870
-When?
- When?

682
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,120
- When did you kiss her? -
Yesterday.Now are we gonna talk--

683
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,580
so yesterday you were
making out with scrub nurses,

684
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,760
and today you're
building our dream house.

685
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,310
Yesterday we were dating other people.

686
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:20,610
-That's not the point.
- That is the point.

687
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:23,290
I told you I wanted to marry you...

688
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:25,860
that I wanted to build a house and a
life with you, and you weren't ready.

689
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,910
And rose is?

690
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,500
You don't want to build a life wh me.

691
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,750
You want someone.

692
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:34,420
You want someone who wants
the same things that you want.

693
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,210
I knew the minute I showed you those plans
that you'd find some reason to walk away.

694
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:40,350
So what, you called my bluff?

695
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:42,700
I did because I can't do this anymore.

696
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:44,990
I can't do the fighting,
the back and forth.I can'T.

697
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,280
Are we together or are we not?

698
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,240
We were together.

699
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,680
I was in love with you.

700
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,350
You didn't tell me you were married.

701
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:51,980
Okay, so now we're gonna
have that fight again.

702
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,640
You didn't tell me about your nurse.

703
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,140
You want to know why I'm not
ready to build a house with you?

704
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,560
This is why.Because i cannot trust you.

705
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,060
You can't trust anybody.

706
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,290
And no matter what I do...

707
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,410
you're always gonna look
for reasons not to trust me.

708
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:12,020
I can't do it anymore.

709
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:15,720
I c--
I can'T.

710
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,670
Well, neither can I.

711
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,260
I need you to hold hands.

712
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,370
Why?

713
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,250
Because the energy in
here, it'S...it's not heang.

714
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:08,590
So I need you to hold hands and
focus all of your love on this child.

715
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:13,800
For a few minutes, I want you
to try to forgive each other.

716
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,640
Can you try to do that?

717
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,430
it's not for you.

718
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:30,970
It's for little tuck.

719
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,810
Is he better?

720
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,820
We don't know yet.

721
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:37,090
I know I haven't called you in a while

722
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:41,850
and that there's a lot that I haven't
told you, and I know I messed up.

723
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,650
But I didn't want to
cause you any more pain,

724
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,140
and I didn't want to disappoint you.

725
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,760
You disappointed yourself, georgie.

726
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,560
You should be disappointed in yourself.

727
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,700
I am.

728
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:57,400
I don't even recognize myself anymore.

729
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,600
This isn't the guy that I wanted to be.

730
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:05,430
Who do you want to be?

731
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:09,280
The guy bailey named her baby after.

732
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,970
I want to be that guy again.

733
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:17,080
You won't go to counseling?

734
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,530
That's just gonna hurt everyone more.

735
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:28,090
I miss your dad.

736
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,590
Me, too.

737
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:33,890
Move back home.I'll take care of you.

738
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:40,290
Well, I think it's time that I
start-- start taking care of myself.

739
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,590
hey, uh, it-- it doesn't help me to
have you all clustered here, watching.

740
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,140
It just doesn't help me.

741
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,720
I appreciate that you're, uh, that
you care, that you're concerned,

742
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,070
but I don't need to be watched.

743
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:21,400
Miranda, he's choking.

744
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,190
He's
chok--

745
00:37:25,490 --> 00:37:27,520
Oh, thank goD.

746
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,070
What are you-- what
are you talking about?

747
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,780
no, it's good.It's good.

748
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,090
He's fighting the tube.It
means he can breathe on his own.

749
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,190
I need your help.

750
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:56,120
hahn said you'd have a heart attack
this afternoon, and, uh, you didn'T.

751
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,770
So you think there might be something
to this healing thing after all?

752
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,970
No, but, uh, I'm gonna help you anyway.

753
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,560
Or, uh, she is.

754
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,050
Uh, this is dr.Steven

755
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,570
-hello.
-Hi.

756
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,730
I'm sorry.I'm--I'm not
sure what I'm doing here.

757
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:14,100
Oh, you're gonna talk her through
a coronary artery dissection repair.

758
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,510
She's an expert?

759
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,730
No, no, no.She's a
second-year resident like me.

760
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:20,190
But she's been focused on, uh,
cardiothoracics for a while,

761
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,780
and she's seen the procedure done.

762
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,240
Well, I appreciate what
you're trying to do, but--

763
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,190
uh, she's, uh, she's like
a bright yellow, right?

764
00:38:27,230 --> 00:38:28,790
What?

765
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,910
What I'm saying is she's an optimist.

766
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,460
She's the opposite of me.

767
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,250
She's exactly the kind of person
you want helping you, right?

768
00:38:35,290 --> 00:38:36,990
she brightens you, that's for sure.

769
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,280
Shut up.

770
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,830
What are we talking about?

771
00:38:39,870 --> 00:38:42,590
Just talk her through the surgery
before she croaks, all right?

772
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,300
Can you do that?

773
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:46,940
Um, you want me to talk you through it?

774
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,070
Uh, in as much detail as possible, yes.

775
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,350
Okay, uh...

776
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,180
yang's got nothing on you.

777
00:38:57,180 --> 00:39:01,070
okay, there are four
chambers in your heart,

778
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:04,630
and ere are three major coronary
arteries that supply blood and oxygen...

779
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,840
as doctors, we know more about the human
body now than at any other point in our hisry.

780
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,810
They extubated him.

781
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,210
His blood pressure's up, too.

782
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,180
Good.

783
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:18,530
Did you know that his
middle name is george?

784
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,670
- Tuck's?
- After me.

785
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,440
I thought dr.Bailey didn't like interns.

786
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,490
Oh, no.

787
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,950
Yeah, she doesn'T.

788
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,860
D-- did you find
an apartment yet?

789
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:33,940
Because I was thinking of...

790
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,290
I was thinking maybe
I'm gonna get one, and...

791
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:40,450
but the miracle of life
itself-- why people live and die,

792
00:39:40,490 --> 00:39:44,320
why they hurt or get
hurt-- is still a mystery.

793
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,040
Here's the thing...

794
00:39:47,870 --> 00:39:49,530
-you're too pretty.
- Oh, come on.

795
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,400
No, so pretty, in fact, that
if we didn't work together,

796
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:57,320
we would probably be...

797
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,330
but the point is we do work together.

798
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,010
And in order for me to do my job,

799
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:10,470
I need to leave who I am outside
the doors of this hospital.So...

800
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,720
oh, hey.You ready?

801
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,120
I am.

802
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,980
Where you guys going?You going to joe's?

803
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:18,840
I'll come meet you.

804
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,220
Good night, dr.Sloan.

805
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:26,700
We want to know the ason, the secret,
the answer at the back of the book...

806
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:29,200
do you want to go to
dinner with me tonight?

807
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,750
I thought you weren't free.

808
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,490
Turns out I am.

809
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:36,870
And I'd like to go out with you tonight.

810
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:39,240
Do you want to go out with me?

811
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,610
That'd be nice.

812
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,520
Because the thought of our being all alone
down here is just too much for us to bear.

813
00:40:47,600 --> 00:40:49,080
How's he doing?

814
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:52,900
He's gonna be just fine.

815
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,960
Where's your husband?

816
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,850
Uh, he went home to get some sleep...

817
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:04,840
and to pack his things 'cause he's
getting himself a hotel room tonight.

818
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:09,500
I'm sorry.

819
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:15,730
For some reason, life just seems to make a
lot more sense when you're looking at a baby.

820
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:19,060
But at the end of the day...

821
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:25,560
the fact that we show up for each
other, in spite of our differences,

822
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,330
no matter what we believe,
is reason enough...

823
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:32,800
to keep believing.
