1
00:00:08,932 --> 00:00:10,384
I just never thought about it.

2
00:00:11,032 --> 00:00:13,699
What I would do, you know?
What the dream would be if I...

3
00:00:14,407 --> 00:00:15,806
couldn't have my dream.

4
00:00:17,027 --> 00:00:18,191
Empty office.

5
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:21,058
What are we doing?
Thought we were gonna lunch.

6
00:00:21,079 --> 00:00:22,210
Why are we still sitting here?

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,145
We're doing what I do
when I get depressed.

8
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:26,249
Just wait.
What time do you have?

9
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:27,678
It's 5 to 1:00.

10
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,550
You know what? I'm glad
I can't have a child.

11
00:00:30,935 --> 00:00:33,010
With my luck, I'd probably
have a kid with two heads.

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,598
It... It's actually better.
I'm grateful.

13
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,601
I don't have to think about it.
The option is...

14
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,828
off the table.

15
00:00:40,898 --> 00:00:42,560
- What time do you have?
- 5 to 1:00.

16
00:00:42,662 --> 00:00:44,390
You people are obsessed with time.

17
00:00:48,938 --> 00:00:50,017
Here he comes.

18
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:02,467
Hi, Dell.

19
00:01:43,857 --> 00:01:45,819
Have a nice... surf.

20
00:01:46,057 --> 00:01:47,465
I'll see you guys after lunch?

21
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,634
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

22
00:02:01,672 --> 00:02:03,304
Admit it.
You feel better.

23
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,217
And if not,
there's another showing in an hour,

24
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:08,631
and it's wet.

25
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:13,368
My brain is bleeding?

26
00:02:13,523 --> 00:02:15,668
How could my brain have been
bleeding since the accident?

27
00:02:15,695 --> 00:02:16,784
Well, it could be
from the trauma,

28
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,762
but it also could be
from one of your surgeries.

29
00:02:19,135 --> 00:02:21,961
Dr. Shepherd, I've been living
in this hospital long enough to know

30
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,933
when there's something
one of you isn't saying.

31
00:02:25,097 --> 00:02:26,694
Because of the location of the bleed,

32
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:28,642
you need to be awake
during surgery.

33
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:30,082
You'll be sedate alert,

34
00:02:30,097 --> 00:02:32,266
but it can be
a really dangerous process.

35
00:02:32,349 --> 00:02:33,762
There's a lot about the brain
we don't know.

36
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:34,842
So...

37
00:02:35,471 --> 00:02:38,213
I could potentially
get my memory back?

38
00:02:38,384 --> 00:02:39,473
Mm. It's possible.

39
00:02:39,545 --> 00:02:41,912
Amnesia can be a symptom,
but I think it's a long shot.

40
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,809
I'll do some brain mapping
and see if anything happens,

41
00:02:43,828 --> 00:02:46,222
- but...
- But I could get my memory back?

42
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:49,727
You're back? What happened?

43
00:02:50,036 --> 00:02:51,163
She's got a fever,

44
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:54,309
- and I think I hear a small murmur.
- A heart murmur?

45
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:55,576
Don't be dramatic.

46
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:57,557
At least it's not the hiccups.

47
00:02:57,576 --> 00:02:59,388
Could be complications
from the endoscopy.

48
00:02:59,408 --> 00:03:00,790
Bacterial endocarditis?

49
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:03,422
You'll have to get tests,
and if they come back positive,

50
00:03:03,431 --> 00:03:05,109
you'll be admitted
for I.V. antibiotics.

51
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:06,509
Which should knock it right out.

52
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:09,292
See? I told you.
Don't be dramatic.

53
00:03:15,622 --> 00:03:17,387
Hey, hey.
You're supposed to wait for me.

54
00:03:17,417 --> 00:03:19,830
I'm going crazy
just sitting there.

55
00:03:20,141 --> 00:03:21,587
Hey, look, I'd be freaked out, too,

56
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,232
if somebody was about to
open up my head.

57
00:03:23,251 --> 00:03:24,992
But Dr. Shepherd, he's the best.

58
00:03:25,047 --> 00:03:26,990
I can't hold my baby, right?

59
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:29,030
She's...
She's in that incubator.

60
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,523
And so the nurses told me
to talk to her. And I try.

61
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,045
Guess what.
Right now, I have nothing to say.

62
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:39,438
You know, I don't even remember
what it feels like to be outside,

63
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,949
to have the wind on my face
or rain or...

64
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:44,355
I know
the surgery is dangerous, but...

65
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:45,729
I'm not freaked.

66
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:48,138
- I can't wait.
- Well, there's no guarantee

67
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,944
the surgery's gonna
bring back your memory.

68
00:03:50,165 --> 00:03:51,376
But there's a chance.

69
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,207
It's better than nothing.

70
00:03:55,949 --> 00:03:58,187
Good news.
Uh, Paul's lack of sex drive

71
00:03:58,272 --> 00:04:00,643
comes from a hormone imbalance.

72
00:04:00,734 --> 00:04:02,208
So Paul still likes sex?

73
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:05,177
Yeah, well, he's a guy and
he's not dead, so I'm guessing yeah.

74
00:04:05,224 --> 00:04:07,017
He... He just can't
do anything about it.

75
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:08,724
- And that's good news?
- The bad news is that

76
00:04:08,734 --> 00:04:09,919
there could be many causes

77
00:04:09,938 --> 00:04:12,984
to this imbalance,
some more serious than others.

78
00:04:13,506 --> 00:04:16,708
So final diagnosis and treatment
could be a lengthy process.

79
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,153
We're gonna have to run
more tests.

80
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:19,190
So it might be a while

81
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:22,653
before Paul can help Kathy...
take the edge off.

82
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,557
Tell her to try swimming.
It's easier on the knees.

83
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:30,863
So...

84
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:32,819
you're the quack.

85
00:04:33,144 --> 00:04:34,496
Uh, I went to med school.

86
00:04:34,584 --> 00:04:36,293
I'm also a licensed herbalist,

87
00:04:36,303 --> 00:04:37,872
and I spent five years in China

88
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,393
learning alternative medicine.

89
00:04:39,963 --> 00:04:42,161
Like I said... quack.

90
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:44,911
Come here.

91
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:46,767
Unless you need to go
tell someone

92
00:04:46,785 --> 00:04:48,470
you saw goody Johnson
with the devil.

93
00:04:50,049 --> 00:04:51,063
Okay.

94
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:54,166
- Lie down on the table.
- Why?

95
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,312
I wanna show you
that I'm not a quack.

96
00:05:00,705 --> 00:05:02,076
I'm not taking my clothes off.

97
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:04,592
Did I ask you
to take your clothes off?

98
00:05:18,649 --> 00:05:19,872
Now...

99
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:26,729
You carry a lot of tension in your
shoulders  and above your right eye.

100
00:05:27,114 --> 00:05:28,410
What do you mean?

101
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:30,624
You're blocking
some serious emotion.

102
00:05:31,688 --> 00:05:32,693
Hang on.

103
00:05:32,741 --> 00:05:34,807
What... What are you doing?

104
00:05:45,172 --> 00:05:47,660
Stop saying "Ow."
It doesn't hurt.

105
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:51,935
- Okay, I'm done.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

106
00:05:51,954 --> 00:05:53,804
Where you going?
You can't leave me here like this.

107
00:05:53,832 --> 00:05:56,016
Lie there. Don't move.
Breathe.

108
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,221
You're going to experience
a rush of emotion,

109
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,493
a release of... psychic pain.

110
00:06:10,848 --> 00:06:12,013
Hello?

111
00:06:13,145 --> 00:06:14,178
Hello?

112
00:06:15,784 --> 00:06:17,201
I don't feel anything...

113
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:19,774
Except stupid for...

114
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:22,869
letting a cute hippie boy
put needles in my face.

115
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,768
Hello!

116
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:27,592
Yeah, Pete...

117
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,844
This isn't working.

118
00:06:30,866 --> 00:06:32,416
I don't have any...

119
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,096
psychic pain.

120
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,891
I... I'm great.

121
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:38,396
Barren, but...

122
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,799
fan-freakin'-tastic.

123
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,207
You can come back now.

124
00:06:44,225 --> 00:06:47,767
I am not feeling any, you know,
rush of emotion or anything.

125
00:06:47,786 --> 00:06:50,581
I don't feel... anything.

126
00:06:57,026 --> 00:06:58,707
I don't feel anything at all.

127
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:06,162
I don't feel anything at all.

128
00:07:13,121 --> 00:07:14,426
I hate L.A.

129
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:23,276
I heard Susan was back.
Is everything okay?

130
00:07:23,284 --> 00:07:24,899
Oh, an infection.
She'll be fine.

131
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:26,851
Oh, good, 'cause I figured
if anything was wrong,

132
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:28,607
- you'd tell me.
- If it was serious, I would,

133
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:30,338
in a very "letting you in"
sort of way.

134
00:07:30,995 --> 00:07:32,469
- You know, it's weird.
- What?

135
00:07:32,638 --> 00:07:34,770
My father...
we're almost talking.

136
00:07:35,946 --> 00:07:36,989
Really?

137
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:39,745
- How's the trailer?
- It's freezing.

138
00:07:40,605 --> 00:07:43,187
You want to eat later?
I'll bring something over.

139
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,830
- Are you using me for central heating?
- Among other things.

140
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:47,335
- Okay.
- All right.

141
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:52,790
Lisa?

142
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:54,940
- I think something is wrong.
- She's in pain.

143
00:07:55,390 --> 00:07:57,627
- Lisa?
- Addison, something is not right.

144
00:07:57,721 --> 00:08:00,512
- My god. I think I just wet my pants.
- No, your water broke.

145
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:02,592
- She's in labor, and it's coming fast.
- I'll call an ambulance.

146
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:03,703
Uh, go get Cooper.

147
00:08:03,722 --> 00:08:06,013
And let the hospital know
we're coming and call the chief.

148
00:08:06,022 --> 00:08:07,738
I don't want any problems
when I try to scrub in.

149
00:08:09,613 --> 00:08:11,425
- I need to push!
- Don't push.

150
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:12,909
Get her into labor
and delivery right away.

151
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:14,073
Jim, check her in.

152
00:08:17,568 --> 00:08:19,511
Is she okay?
Are they okay?

153
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:20,745
- What happened?
- It's too early.

154
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:22,494
- She's not due for another month.
- Well, I'm guessing

155
00:08:22,504 --> 00:08:24,440
that the stress of you all
fighting and crowding her,

156
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,225
declaring yourselves the father
didn't help.

157
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,478
Move!

158
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:38,225
Any word on Lisa and the baby?

159
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:40,900
We're still waiting.

160
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:44,708
- Therapy sucks.
- Said the shrink.

161
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,770
No, I mean my particular
brand of therapy

162
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:49,591
might actually be...
full of crap.

163
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,565
People talking about
their problems endlessly,

164
00:08:52,592 --> 00:08:54,592
telling people
to think positively,

165
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:56,824
- visualize their destiny.
- It doesn't work?

166
00:08:56,894 --> 00:08:59,391
I think positively.
I visualize my destiny.

167
00:09:00,784 --> 00:09:02,493
And look, just look.

168
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,057
What am I lookin' at?

169
00:09:05,221 --> 00:09:06,226
Me...

170
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,812
My pathetic, miserable existence.

171
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:12,478
He left six months ago.

172
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:13,990
He was a loser!

173
00:09:15,446 --> 00:09:18,254
Do you know he peed a little bit
every time he coughed?

174
00:09:18,311 --> 00:09:20,030
Like an incontinent old woman.

175
00:09:20,074 --> 00:09:21,332
He smelled like pee.

176
00:09:22,322 --> 00:09:24,416
And there I was,
in the car, crying,

177
00:09:24,989 --> 00:09:26,322
and I'm a serious feminist.

178
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:28,686
Not to mention, my no-sex couple?

179
00:09:29,077 --> 00:09:31,162
Turns out it was a hormone thing.
It's physical.

180
00:09:31,425 --> 00:09:33,866
In the old days we would've
talked and talked and talked

181
00:09:33,885 --> 00:09:35,616
as Paul got sicker and sicker.

182
00:09:37,265 --> 00:09:39,265
My profession's becoming irrelevant.

183
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:42,286
Maybe it's a good thing.

184
00:09:42,323 --> 00:09:44,933
People should just tell the truth
to the people in their lives.

185
00:09:45,015 --> 00:09:46,094
They can't.

186
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,398
- If they could, we'd all be healthy.
- Like me.

187
00:09:48,426 --> 00:09:49,835
You're not healthy.
You're in denial.

188
00:09:49,848 --> 00:09:50,956
I am not in denial.

189
00:09:50,969 --> 00:09:52,922
You're in denial,
and you're angry.

190
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:54,397
You're the angriest man I know.

191
00:09:54,425 --> 00:09:55,730
Is that why you won't sleep
with me?

192
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:57,725
You're in denial, you're angry,

193
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,967
and you use sex
as weapon to deflect it.

194
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:06,040
Now stimulating area 11.

195
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,692
Ava, can you name this object?

196
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:10,724
Flowers, pink and blue.

197
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,159
Avoiding area 11.
Moving superiorly.

198
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:15,213
This will be area 12.

199
00:10:17,046 --> 00:10:20,464
<i>Una cara con los ojos azules
y el pelo rubio.</i>

200
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:24,302
- Was that spanish?
- Was it?

201
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,907
Okay, I'm going on to 13.

202
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:29,145
<i>Une maison avec des galets rouges.</i>

203
00:10:30,688 --> 00:10:32,345
All right.
Now you're just showing off.

204
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:34,224
Each language is stored in
a different area of the brain.

205
00:10:34,243 --> 00:10:36,591
And as I stimulate them...
this will be 14.

206
00:10:36,627 --> 00:10:37,791
So this isn't from the surgery?

207
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:39,127
She actually speaks
spanish and french?

208
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:42,463
Alex... <i>ich möchte die nächste
Karte, das ist noch das Haus</i>

209
00:10:42,585 --> 00:10:43,593
And german?

210
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,912
She's hypoventilating. Let's put
her under and work on the bleed.

211
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,429
Can't we keep going
just a few more minutes?

212
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,186
Maybe she can get her memory
back along with the languages.

213
00:10:49,204 --> 00:10:50,688
If we don't control this bleed
she'll lose a lot more

214
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:52,077
than her memory she'll die.

215
00:10:55,267 --> 00:10:57,771
- Why is this happening so fast?
- Uh, doctors?

216
00:10:58,242 --> 00:10:59,623
Cooper, she's crowning.

217
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:02,220
- All right, just don't push, Lisa.
- Oh, push? Okay.

218
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,921
No! No, don't push, Lisa.

219
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,197
The cord's wrapped
around the baby's neck.

220
00:11:05,219 --> 00:11:07,064
Oh, I'm sorry!
I can't help it!

221
00:11:07,578 --> 00:11:09,137
God! Oh!

222
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,683
I'll hold her.
You clamp and cut.

223
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:16,082
- Okay.
- Is she okay?

224
00:11:16,213 --> 00:11:17,772
Hang 20 of oxytocin.

225
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:21,076
8 french suction catheter.

226
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:25,116
- Why isn't she crying?
- Cooper's gonna be working on her.

227
00:11:25,135 --> 00:11:27,013
We need to focus
on your right now, Lisa.

228
00:11:27,031 --> 00:11:28,595
Fortunately,
you're not bleeding that much,

229
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:31,307
so we should be able to
remove the placenta by...

230
00:11:33,856 --> 00:11:36,438
By... By what? By what?

231
00:11:36,455 --> 00:11:38,088
- Put her under, now.
- What's going on?

232
00:11:38,095 --> 00:11:40,766
Her uterus must have ruptured
because of the placenta accreta.

233
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,709
- We have to open her up.
- No, no, no, no, no.

234
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:44,595
- The baby's not crying.
- B.P.'s 58 over 32.

235
00:11:44,614 --> 00:11:46,121
Don't put me under
till the baby cries.

236
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,656
We don't have time, Lisa.
We have to put you under right now.

237
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:54,282
Go, Addison.

238
00:11:55,099 --> 00:11:57,080
Hang two units
of B-positive and make sure

239
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:59,771
we have plenty on standby.
She's gonna exsanguinate

240
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,984
if we don't move quickly,
people. 10-blade.

241
00:12:09,133 --> 00:12:10,889
Lisa lost a lot of blood.

242
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:13,218
We had to put the baby
on oxygen but...

243
00:12:13,514 --> 00:12:14,678
they are both stable.

244
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,788
- Who's the father?
- What?

245
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:18,714
You said you sent off
for the paternity test.

246
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:21,461
- Which one of us is the father?
- Did Lisa say anything,

247
00:12:21,493 --> 00:12:22,991
her decision about the baby?

248
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:27,239
Lisa lost a lot of blood,

249
00:12:27,334 --> 00:12:31,221
we had to put the baby on oxygen,
but they are both stable.

250
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,541
I say it again
because it seems like

251
00:12:33,575 --> 00:12:35,453
you didn't hear me
the first time.

252
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:38,428
They almost died.
Lisa... almost died.

253
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,845
And so I didn't have time,

254
00:12:39,854 --> 00:12:42,730
what, with, um,
trying to save her life,

255
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:45,311
to pause and check on
the paternity test

256
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:47,308
or ask her about the baby's future.

257
00:12:47,364 --> 00:12:49,104
What is wrong with you people?

258
00:12:50,161 --> 00:12:52,001
Can... Can we see the baby?

259
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,975
No. None of you go near Lisa
or the baby until I say so.

260
00:12:55,986 --> 00:12:58,662
The child is not a possession
that you fight over.

261
00:13:00,592 --> 00:13:02,310
And by the way, not that you asked,

262
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,179
it's a girl...
6 pounds, 9 ounces.

263
00:13:24,176 --> 00:13:25,209
I don't remember.

264
00:13:27,343 --> 00:13:28,859
We got it, the bleed.

265
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:30,516
You're gonna be fine.

266
00:13:30,841 --> 00:13:32,662
By the way, uh,
you rocked that surgery.

267
00:13:32,672 --> 00:13:34,014
You spoke three languages.

268
00:13:35,384 --> 00:13:36,943
I don't remember anything.

269
00:13:39,857 --> 00:13:41,266
The surgery was sup...

270
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:45,626
I th... I thought I would...

271
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:49,769
What am I gonna do?

272
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:53,150
What if...
What if I never remember anything?

273
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,385
You sick, O'Malley?

274
00:14:05,283 --> 00:14:06,391
You feel fine.

275
00:14:06,568 --> 00:14:08,362
Take an aspirin
and get off my clean bed.

276
00:14:10,486 --> 00:14:12,129
You been married a long time, right?

277
00:14:12,491 --> 00:14:14,092
O'malley, I do not have time

278
00:14:14,129 --> 00:14:15,923
- to answer...
- Did you have doubts...

279
00:14:17,063 --> 00:14:18,096
about your marriage?

280
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:19,978
I don't mean, uh, insecurities.

281
00:14:20,237 --> 00:14:22,885
- I mean really serious doubts.
- Dr. Bailey I need you to sign this

282
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,256
before I can discharge bed ten.

283
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:27,628
No. He's supposed to get
an I.V. dose before discharge.

284
00:14:27,647 --> 00:14:29,149
Why don't people listen?

285
00:14:35,012 --> 00:14:36,646
Someday you'll have
to explain to me

286
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,233
how antibiotics actually work.

287
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:39,897
They are miraculous.

288
00:14:40,184 --> 00:14:41,264
Good afternoon.

289
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,965
Dr. Bailey asked me to look in.

290
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:44,506
Everything looks good.

291
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:47,902
We are going to take you
to radiology to get a central line

292
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:50,684
to continue your
I.V. antibiotics outpatient.

293
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,174
Hey, will you show
your dad the cafeteria?

294
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:58,924
Sure. We're on to you, you know?

295
00:14:59,215 --> 00:15:00,370
What?

296
00:15:06,669 --> 00:15:07,720
Dr. Bailey.

297
00:15:07,934 --> 00:15:11,183
I was... Looking for some privacy,
and, uh...

298
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:14,309
I didn't think anyone would come
looking for me down here.

299
00:15:14,328 --> 00:15:16,769
- I apologize.
- Problem. Take your time.

300
00:15:17,632 --> 00:15:18,702
Uh, Dr. Bailey.

301
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:20,274
Yeah.

302
00:15:20,705 --> 00:15:22,405
Um, you've been married

303
00:15:22,715 --> 00:15:24,109
a long time now, right?

304
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:26,611
Do you think it matters
if one person...

305
00:15:28,171 --> 00:15:29,796
Is... Is more ready?

306
00:15:29,892 --> 00:15:31,244
O'Malley!

307
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:35,341
Come here.

308
00:15:38,398 --> 00:15:39,402
Yes. Hi, Dr. Burke.

309
00:15:39,435 --> 00:15:41,872
I want the two of you
to talk to each other.

310
00:15:41,891 --> 00:15:44,726
I want you to talk to each other
and leave my marriage out of it.

311
00:15:44,757 --> 00:15:46,926
I also want you to leave
my clinic out of it.

312
00:15:47,011 --> 00:15:48,750
And by that, I mean get out.

313
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:52,078
I need the space, I need the peace,
I need the quiet, and I need it now.

314
00:15:52,096 --> 00:15:53,702
- Sorry.
- Yeah, right, sorry.

315
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,005
Cooper, you're blocking the caffeine.

316
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,340
He's blocking the caffeine.

317
00:16:06,005 --> 00:16:07,948
Cooper, if you move,
I'll give you a cookie.

318
00:16:08,206 --> 00:16:10,117
Hey, did something go wrong
with Lisa's surgery?

319
00:16:10,151 --> 00:16:11,325
No, uh, we handled it.

320
00:16:11,465 --> 00:16:13,554
Addison...
She is, uh, pretty excellent.

321
00:16:13,573 --> 00:16:14,638
She's pretty excellent.

322
00:16:18,207 --> 00:16:20,404
Okay, only because
you've sighed twice...

323
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:22,291
What's the matter, Cooper?

324
00:16:26,602 --> 00:16:28,800
I don't go to hookers.
I don't go to strip clubs.

325
00:16:28,955 --> 00:16:31,509
I meet women on the Internet
that want to meet me.

326
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,784
So I like 'em a little younger
and a little dirtier.

327
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,273
Is that wrong?

328
00:16:39,487 --> 00:16:42,025
- It's wrong?
- You need to meet a grown-up.

329
00:16:42,049 --> 00:16:43,509
You need to date
someone your own age.

330
00:16:43,518 --> 00:16:45,938
Someone without
a porny internet name

331
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,381
and perhaps no criminal past.

332
00:16:47,394 --> 00:16:48,848
- A nice girl.
- A viable girl.

333
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:50,558
Someone with whom you can
have a relationship.

334
00:16:50,563 --> 00:16:51,962
You're a respected doctor.

335
00:16:51,972 --> 00:16:54,728
Go out in the real world,
meet a woman your own age

336
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,724
- and ask her out.
- Be a man, Cooper.

337
00:16:58,546 --> 00:16:59,720
Be a man.

338
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,339
There you are.

339
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:15,505
I just stopped by to see how
Lisa and the baby are doing.

340
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:21,893
- You okay?
- Yeah. I just... I...

341
00:17:23,499 --> 00:17:25,072
I had a little
too much surgery today.

342
00:17:25,081 --> 00:17:26,245
But I'm... I'm good.

343
00:17:29,592 --> 00:17:30,862
- You look good.
- Yeah.

344
00:17:31,828 --> 00:17:33,997
You look... beautiful.

345
00:17:36,853 --> 00:17:38,669
Sam told me that
I had to stay away from you

346
00:17:38,687 --> 00:17:40,782
- because you're Naomi's friend, but...
- Stop it.

347
00:17:40,898 --> 00:17:42,222
- What?
- You're flirting.

348
00:17:42,342 --> 00:17:44,511
- What's wrong with flirting?
- What's wrong with it?

349
00:17:44,576 --> 00:17:45,824
What's wrong?

350
00:17:46,293 --> 00:17:49,016
What's wrong is
that I don't have time for it.

351
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:51,909
I am... out of time.
I missed my chance.

352
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,813
And now I have two eggs left.

353
00:17:54,316 --> 00:17:56,373
I might as well have no eggs left.

354
00:17:56,439 --> 00:17:58,008
I am egg-less.

355
00:17:58,454 --> 00:17:59,970
Naomi says that she's dried up?

356
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:03,190
I'm the one who's dried up.
I'm all barren and dried up.

357
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,703
And I have clearly
been wasting my time on men.

358
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,699
I mean,
I might as well take up hobbies,

359
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,370
like needlepoint,

360
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,423
or, um, collecting those little
ceramic dolls, you know?

361
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:14,327
Because that's
what dried up women do.

362
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,592
They do needlepoint.

363
00:18:15,741 --> 00:18:18,865
They do not waste their time
flirting with men

364
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:20,283
who clearly just want to get laid.

365
00:18:20,293 --> 00:18:22,123
They do not waste their time...

366
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,427
telling overly personal...

367
00:18:27,626 --> 00:18:30,820
information about their eggs
to total strangers.

368
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,144
Oh, my god. I'm sorry.

369
00:18:33,809 --> 00:18:35,190
What are you doing?

370
00:18:36,944 --> 00:18:38,089
I'm gonna kiss you.

371
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:40,096
I'm gonna kiss you with tongue.

372
00:18:41,695 --> 00:18:43,432
I'm gonna kiss you
so you feel it.

373
00:18:44,812 --> 00:18:45,873
Okay?

374
00:18:48,176 --> 00:18:49,181
Okay.

375
00:19:18,312 --> 00:19:19,476
Why'd you do that?

376
00:19:20,787 --> 00:19:21,970
To remind you...

377
00:19:23,069 --> 00:19:24,346
that you're not dried up.

378
00:19:27,797 --> 00:19:29,600
If you need me
to remind you again...

379
00:19:31,686 --> 00:19:32,728
let me know.

380
00:19:46,956 --> 00:19:48,340
When do the cramping start?

381
00:19:48,355 --> 00:19:49,928
- A little while ago.
- What is it?

382
00:19:49,947 --> 00:19:51,553
- Is it...
- Probably nothing serious.

383
00:19:51,562 --> 00:19:53,486
It could just be a reaction
to the antibiotics.

384
00:19:53,505 --> 00:19:54,879
We may have to switch
to another one,

385
00:19:54,888 --> 00:19:56,832
but it may mean
another night here.

386
00:19:57,801 --> 00:19:59,285
It's okay, it's okay.

387
00:19:59,936 --> 00:20:00,960
It's okay.

388
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,254
Wait.

389
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:12,096
I know...
I know that you think we're awful,

390
00:20:12,114 --> 00:20:14,292
and I think that we're awful.

391
00:20:14,406 --> 00:20:15,607
I just, um...

392
00:20:17,278 --> 00:20:19,100
I just wanted a baby so badly.

393
00:20:19,841 --> 00:20:20,931
I just wanted a baby.

394
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:23,015
And I don't care
who the father is,

395
00:20:23,034 --> 00:20:24,489
I don't care if the baby's mine.

396
00:20:24,494 --> 00:20:27,977
All that matters is the baby.
Is... Is she gonna be okay?

397
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,059
Just tell me that
she's gonna be okay.

398
00:20:35,468 --> 00:20:36,698
She's gonna be okay.

399
00:20:39,975 --> 00:20:40,979
Thank you.

400
00:20:41,856 --> 00:20:43,058
You're welcome.

401
00:20:50,855 --> 00:20:52,545
I hear Callie's going to be
a bridesmaid.

402
00:20:52,601 --> 00:20:53,624
Yeah.

403
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,217
Would you, um, say that
you were the one

404
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,969
that needed more urging
to get married?

405
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,218
Oh, I hadn't...

406
00:21:04,044 --> 00:21:05,706
Really been thinking about it.
I...

407
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:08,840
It just, uh, seemed like
a good idea at the time.

408
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:13,148
You and Cristina have been
together for a while.

409
00:21:13,176 --> 00:21:14,312
You got married pretty fast.

410
00:21:14,325 --> 00:21:16,635
So in theory it's better
to know someone pretty well.

411
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:19,340
- Way better than...
- Still, no guarantees.

412
00:21:21,306 --> 00:21:22,536
I-I don't...

413
00:21:23,551 --> 00:21:25,692
- believe in divorce.
- Neither do I.

414
00:21:28,797 --> 00:21:29,905
Is it possible...

415
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:33,480
do you think,
to love two people...

416
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,204
at the same time?

417
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,450
I, uh...

418
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:43,481
I'm still hoping it's possible
just to love one person.

419
00:21:47,696 --> 00:21:49,856
So, uh, it's not gonna be
too weird, right?

420
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:51,767
- Me as a bridesmaid?
- No, no, it's fine.

421
00:21:51,776 --> 00:21:53,630
- 'Cause I can tell Cristina...
- I said it's fine.

422
00:21:53,657 --> 00:21:54,887
Really, no worries.

423
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:56,427
So, um...

424
00:21:56,948 --> 00:21:59,478
Did George tell you he's thinking
about transferring to Mercy West?

425
00:21:59,496 --> 00:22:01,657
Yeah. Sounds like a good idea.

426
00:22:03,512 --> 00:22:06,010
- So we're fine?
- Oh, we are. Fine.

427
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,127
Hey, that last dress
was okay, wasn't it?

428
00:22:11,294 --> 00:22:14,280
I mean, it was too tight
and I couldn't breathe, but...

429
00:22:15,191 --> 00:22:17,017
- A wedding's just one day, right?
- Yeah.

430
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:25,544
We got Paul's M.R.I. back,

431
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:28,519
and I've consulted with
Dr. Straley at Sloan-Kettering.

432
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,577
We found a tumor
on your adrenal gland.

433
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,540
All right? Is its right
on top of the kidney,

434
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:35,699
and it's what's been causing
your low sex drive.

435
00:22:37,373 --> 00:22:39,354
So it wasn't me?
He's got a condition.

436
00:22:40,249 --> 00:22:43,076
A tumor, that's not too...

437
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,156
You can treat that, right?

438
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,507
These tumors are usually
aggressive and found late

439
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,582
because the symptoms
are so subtle.

440
00:22:52,585 --> 00:22:53,609
What does that mean?

441
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:55,735
Treatment is difficult and risky,

442
00:22:56,307 --> 00:22:57,876
but there is hope.

443
00:22:59,201 --> 00:23:01,867
Oh, my god, honey,
I can't believe I yelled at you.

444
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,379
I'm so sorry.

445
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:05,636
It's all right, honey.
It's okay.

446
00:23:05,655 --> 00:23:07,772
No, I'm horrible.
I'm so sorry.

447
00:23:07,824 --> 00:23:09,331
I love you so much.

448
00:23:29,011 --> 00:23:30,241
Hello?

449
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:34,243
Hello?

450
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:38,782
Are you there...

451
00:23:39,576 --> 00:23:41,420
elevator god?

452
00:23:42,469 --> 00:23:43,905
It's me, Addison.

453
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,450
<i>What?</i>

454
00:23:46,774 --> 00:23:47,835
Hi.

455
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:49,176
<i>Hi.</i>

456
00:23:49,681 --> 00:23:52,545
Okay, look, you may be
a figment of my imagination,

457
00:23:52,578 --> 00:23:54,719
or maybe I'm going
completely insane,

458
00:23:55,573 --> 00:23:57,320
I don't know. Or maybe...

459
00:23:57,771 --> 00:23:59,863
this is payback for my crimes

460
00:23:59,872 --> 00:24:02,074
on some ginormous karmic level,
I don't know.

461
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,377
I just...

462
00:24:04,522 --> 00:24:08,222
I just want to tell you
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

463
00:24:11,347 --> 00:24:12,352
Okay?

464
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:14,951
<i>Okay.</i>

465
00:24:19,667 --> 00:24:20,710
Well...

466
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:22,897
bye.

467
00:24:28,463 --> 00:24:29,909
I am such a screwup...

468
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,255
in my life.

469
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:36,256
Up until now, I have been
really great at one thing.

470
00:24:37,199 --> 00:24:39,274
I am great...

471
00:24:40,053 --> 00:24:41,353
at being Paul's wife.

472
00:24:41,903 --> 00:24:43,593
And I thought
he didn't want me anymore.

473
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,829
I thought... I was sure that he was
in love with somebody else.

474
00:24:47,014 --> 00:24:48,065
Of course you were.

475
00:24:49,328 --> 00:24:50,398
I lied to Paul.

476
00:24:53,378 --> 00:24:54,693
I was with a man

477
00:24:54,969 --> 00:24:56,922
that night that I didn't come home.

478
00:24:59,781 --> 00:25:01,326
I didn't even find him
that attractive.

479
00:25:01,349 --> 00:25:02,363
I just told myself

480
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:04,756
that I wasn't gonna settle
for being alone, you know?

481
00:25:05,769 --> 00:25:08,764
Kathy, you were reacting
to what was in front of you.

482
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:12,367
There was no way you could
know what was really going on.

483
00:25:12,458 --> 00:25:14,382
What do I do now?

484
00:25:22,824 --> 00:25:24,805
You do what you're great at.

485
00:25:26,189 --> 00:25:27,522
You love your husband.

486
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,653
You're gonna have to
tell me that a lot, okay?

487
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:39,244
Okay.

488
00:25:44,256 --> 00:25:46,162
Hey, everyone else is gone.
I was heading out.

489
00:25:47,388 --> 00:25:50,759
Uh, unless... I was gonna get
some food. You want something?

490
00:25:53,891 --> 00:25:55,459
I... I ate.

491
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:56,878
Thanks for asking.

492
00:25:59,304 --> 00:26:00,346
Another night?

493
00:26:02,249 --> 00:26:04,155
- Are you...
- Asking you out on a date? Yes.

494
00:26:04,183 --> 00:26:05,741
You can't ask me out.

495
00:26:05,751 --> 00:26:07,071
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

496
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,259
I asked.

497
00:26:08,388 --> 00:26:10,548
You're... You're a fetus.

498
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:13,193
You could be my fetus.

499
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:15,276
Coo coo cachoo, Mrs. Robinson.

500
00:26:15,291 --> 00:26:17,760
You can't use "The Graduate"
as a defense.

501
00:26:17,852 --> 00:26:20,608
You can't use a movie made
before you were born as a defense.

502
00:26:20,637 --> 00:26:21,651
Go out with me.

503
00:26:23,214 --> 00:26:25,111
I like you, and you like me.

504
00:26:30,954 --> 00:26:31,958
Dell.

505
00:26:35,421 --> 00:26:36,754
Never gonna happen.

506
00:26:50,469 --> 00:26:54,122
I'm starting to think L.A.
is like New York, but with a beach.

507
00:26:54,378 --> 00:26:55,711
Why do you think we moved here?

508
00:26:58,054 --> 00:26:59,115
Uh, Pete.

509
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:01,125
Uh, isn't it time for you
to get some refills?

510
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,590
Thanks.

511
00:27:09,693 --> 00:27:11,265
Okay, Pete is my friend,

512
00:27:11,509 --> 00:27:13,293
don't get me wrong, but...

513
00:27:13,321 --> 00:27:14,741
Why are you warning me
about him?

514
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:17,117
What, is he like a serial killer?
Is he a felon?

515
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:20,448
Is he secretly
my ex-husband's best friend?

516
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,672
His wife died eight years ago.

517
00:27:24,489 --> 00:27:26,761
- Now I feel shallow.
- No, it's just...

518
00:27:27,154 --> 00:27:29,042
He can't connect with women.

519
00:27:29,276 --> 00:27:30,300
He's a good man,

520
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:32,552
but if you want someone
who's gonna be there,

521
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:34,355
then Pete's not that guy.

522
00:27:36,701 --> 00:27:38,551
- You ready?
- Yeah, good.

523
00:27:47,883 --> 00:27:48,981
This is nice, huh?

524
00:27:50,605 --> 00:27:52,061
- It is.
- Yeah.

525
00:28:01,403 --> 00:28:02,483
- Oh, no.
- What?

526
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,068
- That's not nice.
- Oh, you s...

527
00:28:04,093 --> 00:28:06,140
Hold it, hold it, hold on.
You said, "Be a man."

528
00:28:06,155 --> 00:28:09,126
Cooper, I commend you.
You're making an effort.

529
00:28:09,148 --> 00:28:11,824
But I'm... I'm...
But I'm your friend.

530
00:28:11,951 --> 00:28:14,167
You can't be a man
with your friend.

531
00:28:15,468 --> 00:28:17,716
- Isn't that settling?
- Kinda, yeah.

532
00:28:21,494 --> 00:28:22,527
Yes.

533
00:28:22,542 --> 00:28:23,715
- Okay.
- Settling.

534
00:28:23,741 --> 00:28:25,131
- Great.
- Thank you, yes.

535
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:27,117
- But we're good?
- We're very good.

536
00:28:30,345 --> 00:28:31,491
Hey, ex-best friend.

537
00:28:31,713 --> 00:28:33,892
- Hey, ex-husband.
- You are drunk.

538
00:28:34,029 --> 00:28:36,630
Ten more minutes, and I start dancing,
and I require company.

539
00:28:42,254 --> 00:28:44,311
I don't think I've ever
seen her drunk before.

540
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,262
Sam...

541
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:52,514
Did you cheat on her?

542
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:55,598
Over the years,
there have been temptations,

543
00:28:56,701 --> 00:28:59,445
but, no... I didn't.

544
00:28:59,856 --> 00:29:02,767
Was there a lot of fighting or...

545
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:04,593
Hardly ever.

546
00:29:06,838 --> 00:29:08,039
Honestly...

547
00:29:09,897 --> 00:29:11,719
it was bad, what I did.

548
00:29:14,728 --> 00:29:16,071
I have no good reason.

549
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:19,658
I woke up one day...

550
00:29:21,205 --> 00:29:23,064
and I couldn't do it anymore.

551
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:25,354
It wasn't even a choice.

552
00:29:28,234 --> 00:29:29,351
I had a thought...

553
00:29:30,818 --> 00:29:32,077
Next thing you know...

554
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,637
I'm burning it all down.

555
00:29:36,344 --> 00:29:37,349
I left her.

556
00:29:39,482 --> 00:29:40,543
I don't know why.

557
00:29:42,848 --> 00:29:43,974
I don't know why.

558
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:47,104
What kind of a person does that?

559
00:29:47,447 --> 00:29:48,447
Hell if I know.

560
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,191
And I did it, too.

561
00:29:58,257 --> 00:29:59,600
So I ran into Allan...

562
00:29:59,909 --> 00:30:00,933
at Whole Foods.

563
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:02,477
Wanna hear something funny?

564
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:06,803
He said he didn't believe in marriage,
that marriage wasn't for him.

565
00:30:07,196 --> 00:30:08,501
But I guess that was wrong,

566
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:11,525
because it only took him
four months.

567
00:30:12,007 --> 00:30:14,795
Four months after we broke up,
he got married,

568
00:30:14,984 --> 00:30:17,218
to someone who can't be
more than 25 years old.

569
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:19,562
Isn't that funny?

570
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:37,065
It heads off rejection.

571
00:30:38,763 --> 00:30:39,833
What?

572
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,190
That's why I like the Internet.

573
00:30:42,845 --> 00:30:44,341
I can't stand the...

574
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:47,747
It's horrible, being rejected.

575
00:30:49,549 --> 00:30:50,581
It is.

576
00:31:02,704 --> 00:31:05,220
Preston, I thought you had
a late surgery.

577
00:31:10,707 --> 00:31:12,106
You know all that...

578
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:14,097
"I trust you" crap?

579
00:31:14,802 --> 00:31:16,990
You've been pulling that on me
since I was this high.

580
00:31:17,018 --> 00:31:18,379
Preston, language.

581
00:31:18,421 --> 00:31:19,491
No.

582
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:25,139
"I trust you" is code for
"Learn from your mistakes."

583
00:31:25,332 --> 00:31:26,412
This is not a mistake.

584
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:28,036
I never said it was a mistake.

585
00:31:28,064 --> 00:31:30,998
Cristina never knows
what's good for her.

586
00:31:31,291 --> 00:31:32,916
- That's who she is.
- Preston...

587
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:35,019
She hates change.

588
00:31:35,038 --> 00:31:36,774
I lead. I have to.

589
00:31:37,404 --> 00:31:38,437
And then she's grateful.

590
00:31:38,503 --> 00:31:40,982
That's how it was with dating,
with moving in.

591
00:31:41,295 --> 00:31:42,676
Then I'm pleased for you.

592
00:31:44,521 --> 00:31:46,877
Look, I am going to
make her happy, Mama.

593
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:48,590
The wedding is a huge step,

594
00:31:48,641 --> 00:31:50,576
and she's being a great sport.
You know why?

595
00:31:50,688 --> 00:31:53,017
Because she will be
happy someday.

596
00:31:54,937 --> 00:31:56,571
If you are so sure...

597
00:31:57,764 --> 00:31:59,652
why are you yelling at me?

598
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:10,129
- What happened?
- She's septic.

599
00:32:10,167 --> 00:32:11,454
The sooner
we can get her to an O.R.,

600
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,956
the sooner we can help her.
Let's move.

601
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:15,246
- Richard, what... happened?
- Extremely rare complication.

602
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:17,168
Toxic megacolon with a perforation.

603
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,559
Can you get your dad
out of this room?

604
00:32:18,582 --> 00:32:20,037
This fast? How could...

605
00:32:20,066 --> 00:32:21,860
Sometimes it progresses this rapidly.

606
00:32:21,865 --> 00:32:24,071
Very rarely, but sometimes.
We booked an O.R.

607
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:25,516
You're going into surgery
right now?

608
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:27,252
I didn't sign a consent form.

609
00:32:27,262 --> 00:32:29,064
She needs surgery right now,
Thatcher.

610
00:32:29,078 --> 00:32:31,372
Not tomorrow, not later today.
Right now.

611
00:32:31,391 --> 00:32:32,552
- Thatcher.
- Honey, listen...

612
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:34,195
We need you to stay back, okay?

613
00:32:43,181 --> 00:32:44,692
You're gonna be okay.
This happens.

614
00:32:44,702 --> 00:32:45,950
You're gonna be okay.

615
00:32:46,651 --> 00:32:48,539
We're losing her pulse,
she's coding.

616
00:32:48,548 --> 00:32:50,252
Okay, let's go.
Let's move. Move.

617
00:32:59,181 --> 00:33:00,453
She's okay, huh?

618
00:33:01,134 --> 00:33:02,577
I mean,
after all she went through,

619
00:33:02,591 --> 00:33:04,341
she still looks pretty awesome.

620
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:06,322
Lisa,

621
00:33:06,491 --> 00:33:08,566
we need to know what you want
to do with the baby.

622
00:33:08,998 --> 00:33:10,961
Carol...
she wants this so bad.

623
00:33:11,248 --> 00:33:12,806
This is about what you want.

624
00:33:14,431 --> 00:33:17,088
- We did find out the paternity.
- No, no. I don't wanna know.

625
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:21,538
She's awesome, though.

626
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:25,081
You don't have to decide right now.

627
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:27,683
No. I know what I want to do.

628
00:33:32,451 --> 00:33:34,038
Lisa gave the baby to Carol.

629
00:33:34,195 --> 00:33:36,383
On the condition
they'd all be part of her life.

630
00:33:36,524 --> 00:33:39,031
So it turns out the baby
will have three dads anyway.

631
00:33:39,135 --> 00:33:40,346
And two moms.

632
00:33:40,526 --> 00:33:41,643
Lisa did a good thing.

633
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,029
They look happy.

634
00:33:45,777 --> 00:33:47,204
They look like a family.

635
00:34:16,187 --> 00:34:18,168
- Izzie, look...
- Look, I don't want you to go.

636
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:19,874
To Mercy West...
I don't want you...

637
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,989
It's not fair.

638
00:34:25,525 --> 00:34:26,915
I know we can't help
what happened,

639
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:28,258
and I know that we didn't...

640
00:34:30,375 --> 00:34:32,225
I stood in that bridal shop
with your wife,

641
00:34:32,247 --> 00:34:34,200
and I smiled and I talked,
and I...

642
00:34:34,547 --> 00:34:35,721
felt like...

643
00:34:38,655 --> 00:34:39,772
That's not fair.

644
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:41,903
I don't want you to go
to Mercy West

645
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:44,898
because I'm losing my best friend,
and it's not fair.

646
00:34:47,609 --> 00:34:48,886
It's just not fair.

647
00:35:25,695 --> 00:35:26,794
We can't.

648
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:28,933
I know.

649
00:35:32,418 --> 00:35:34,456
I was looking for you.
You ready to go?

650
00:35:42,721 --> 00:35:44,988
A lot of folks would kill
for what you have, you know?

651
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,583
A clean slate.

652
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:50,428
So you don't remember?
So what?

653
00:35:51,798 --> 00:35:53,075
You'll make new memories.

654
00:35:53,973 --> 00:35:55,381
Oh, wow. Look at that.

655
00:35:56,613 --> 00:35:57,824
It's so beautiful.

656
00:36:03,341 --> 00:36:04,918
How can you be so...

657
00:36:06,258 --> 00:36:08,442
You're so good with me.

658
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:11,329
What's wrong with you
that you can't be is good

659
00:36:11,338 --> 00:36:13,357
with someone
you have feelings for?

660
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:17,138
What happened to you, Alex?

661
00:36:25,187 --> 00:36:27,802
Maybe I don't remember.
So what?

662
00:37:04,707 --> 00:37:07,984
We did everything...
we could.

663
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:23,693
You... You said
it was really simple

664
00:37:23,755 --> 00:37:25,201
and that it was this...

665
00:37:26,014 --> 00:37:28,314
- small thing.
- It was.

666
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:30,564
She had the hiccups.

667
00:37:33,616 --> 00:37:34,686
She came here...

668
00:37:35,512 --> 00:37:37,071
because...
because she trusted you.

669
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,572
I trusted you.

670
00:37:43,108 --> 00:37:45,530
- Meredith, just stop. Okay, just stop.
- No, don't. Don't.

671
00:37:47,078 --> 00:37:49,124
<i>At some point, maybe we accept</i>

672
00:37:49,153 --> 00:37:51,256
<i>that the dream
has become a nightmare.</i>

673
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:55,819
She had the hiccups.
Oh, god.

674
00:37:57,953 --> 00:37:59,305
The hiccups.

675
00:38:10,532 --> 00:38:12,485
They've left. It's just us.

676
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:15,086
Oh, thank god.

677
00:38:27,177 --> 00:38:28,473
I got a dress.

678
00:38:32,241 --> 00:38:33,302
You happy?

679
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:36,644
Yeah.

680
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,400
Are you... happy?

681
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,536
Yeah.

682
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,665
<i>We tell ourselves
the reality is better.</i>

683
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,265
Limes!

684
00:38:56,526 --> 00:38:57,756
- Limes.
- Limes.

685
00:38:57,775 --> 00:38:59,687
So what are we
drinking to this time?

686
00:38:59,842 --> 00:39:02,452
Friends. Crappy friends.

687
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:04,806
Family. Crappy family.

688
00:39:10,771 --> 00:39:11,832
Again?

689
00:39:12,048 --> 00:39:13,052
- Again.
- Again.

690
00:39:15,402 --> 00:39:16,697
<i>Who wants another?</i>

691
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:30,705
<i>We convince ourselves</i>

692
00:39:30,714 --> 00:39:32,621
<i>it's better
that we never dream at all.</i>

693
00:39:34,837 --> 00:39:36,274
<i>But the strongest of us,</i>

694
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:38,251
<i>the most determined of us,</i>

695
00:39:38,636 --> 00:39:40,072
<i>we hold on to the dream.</i>

696
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:42,133
You're ugly and old.

697
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:43,996
I'll miss you, too.

698
00:39:50,294 --> 00:39:51,806
There is an empty office.

699
00:39:53,093 --> 00:39:54,163
Don't tempt me.

700
00:39:54,651 --> 00:39:55,750
Think about it.

701
00:39:58,254 --> 00:40:02,226
<i>Or we find ourselves faced with
a fresh dream we never considered.</i>

702
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,266
Hold the door.

703
00:40:07,326 --> 00:40:09,270
<i>We awake to find ourselves...</i>

704
00:40:10,567 --> 00:40:12,042
<i>against all odds...</i>

705
00:40:14,028 --> 00:40:15,296
<i>feeling hopeful.</i>

706
00:40:16,165 --> 00:40:17,508
This is gonna sound...

707
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,783
When no one else is around,

708
00:40:22,075 --> 00:40:23,615
the elevator kind of, uh....

709
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,793
Talks to me.

710
00:40:28,388 --> 00:40:29,449
Hi, Tilly.

711
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,305
<i>Hey, Pete.</i>

712
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:32,704
That's Tilly.

713
00:40:33,032 --> 00:40:35,342
She works security.
The camera is right there.

714
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:44,313
Hello, Tilly.

715
00:40:44,398 --> 00:40:46,593
<i>Hey, I get my kicks
wherever I can.</i>

716
00:40:49,186 --> 00:40:50,893
- You goin' home?
- Yeah...

717
00:40:52,068 --> 00:40:53,095
Home.

718
00:40:53,696 --> 00:40:54,936
You get what you came for?

719
00:40:56,263 --> 00:40:59,051
I honestly... don't know.

720
00:41:02,114 --> 00:41:03,579
Do you want me
to kiss you again?

721
00:41:06,086 --> 00:41:07,222
I think...

722
00:41:08,649 --> 00:41:09,748
not.

723
00:41:09,899 --> 00:41:11,664
Because of the evators
where you come from?

724
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:14,068
Those horny,
aphrodisiac elevators?

725
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:17,460
Yeah, that, and, um...

726
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:19,876
I'm not interested, so...

727
00:41:33,328 --> 00:41:34,596
You're interested.

728
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:40,361
<i>And if we're lucky,
we realize...</i>

729
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,075
<i>in the face of everything,
in the face of life...</i>

730
00:41:49,628 --> 00:41:50,950
<i>The true dream...</i>

731
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,051
<i>is being able to dream at all.</i>
