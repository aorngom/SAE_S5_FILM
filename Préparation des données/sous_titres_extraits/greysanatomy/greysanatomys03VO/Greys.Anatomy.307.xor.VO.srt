00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,120
Previously  on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,880
you understand there are rules
to your probation?

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,860
the divorce was finalized this morning.

4
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,430
I think I need a little time to--

5
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,130
- take some space.
- Yeah.

6
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:12,660
The other night?
That was me breaking up with you.

7
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:13,930
I slept with another guy.

8
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,260
It was not cheerful.
It was dirty.

9
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,680
you told me your hand was fine.

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,180
It's not fine!

11
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,310
stop worrying.
We are a well-oiled machine.

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,390
Nobody has to know.

15
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:39,670
as surgeons,we're  trained to look for disease.

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:41,840
You're going camping?

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:43,600
Yeah,with shepherd.
Yes.

18
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,330
With the sleeping on the ground and everyone
peeing behind the same bush?

19
00:00:47,330 --> 00:00:48,410
Fresh air.

20
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,920
Sometimes the problem's  easily detected.

21
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,510
We have back-to-back cabgs.
I booked the O.R.S.

22
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,010
- I canceled the O.R.S.
- Why?

23
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,440
Because I'm going camping with shepherd.

24
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,370
But why?

25
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,380
Ah,getting away,out of the city,men being men.

26
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,070
mountain men in the wild.

27
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,520
Ah,the open road.

28
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,570
The road not taken.
The uncharted course.

29
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,140
Terra incognita.

30
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,570
Well,okay.

31
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:19,320
Most of the time,you need to go step-by-step,

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,370
first probing the surface,
looking for any sign  of trouble...

33
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,400
we do have to make one stop.

34
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,770
A mole or a lesion  or an unwelcome lump.

35
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,650
- Mountain men in the wild.
- Yeah.

36
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,900
Terra incognita.

37
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,650
You know,this is my first camping trip.

38
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:38,380
Oh,you don't say?

39
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:41,480
So,preston...
any other little surprises?

40
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,410
You have sunscreen and insect repellant?

41
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,070
Oh,and you're gonna need a shovel
to bury your poop.

42
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:47,280
Izzie,I'm not 5.
Zip me.

43
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,440
And if callie calls,will you tell her...

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,230
tell her I'm a mountain man.

45
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,240
I'm a man on aountain,right,Dr. Burke?

46
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,580
Okay,him I invited.

47
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,470
Izzie baked us treats.

48
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,350
Have fun with your,um...

49
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,300
space...
or whatever.

50
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:10,070
I just thought we needed an extra tent.
Maybe joe misunderstood?

51
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,490
Hey,you want to follow us or
should we follow you?

52
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,330
hey,guys.

53
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,520
That wasn't me,I swear.

54
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,780
Most of the time,we can't tell what's wrong
with somebody  by just looking at them.

55
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:36,250
After all,they can look  perfectly
fine on the outside

56
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,260
while their insides tell us
a whole other story.

57
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,310
Derek's camping--

58
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,500
taking time,getting space.

59
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,270
Prestons do not go into the woods.

60
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,370
A guy named preston is gonna get
his ass kicked by a squirrel.

61
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,140
It's basically a slumber party.

62
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,960
They do it outside,we do it inside.
That's really the only difference.

63
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,180
Have you seen what's his face?

64
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,500
Alex karev.

65
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,530
Poor bastard seems to get a thrill
out of tagging along after me.

66
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,850
he's camping.

67
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:32,770
Well,in that case,how'd you like to get a
thrill out of tagging along after me?

68
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,470
Dr. Bailey makes the assignments.

69
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,880
Dr. Bailey says it's fine.

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,810
Go.

71
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,290
Stevens,conference room.
You're spending the day with a peer counselor.

72
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:48,220
Is that like a shrink?
The hospital's already making me see a shrink.

73
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,950
Go...
meet your peer,get counseled.

74
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,730
Exciting procedures on the board today,
huh,yang?

75
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,010
Yes,Dr. Bailey.
Which one would you like me to start with?

76
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:58,490
are those...
monopoly pieces.

77
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:02,520
21 of them to be exact,mostly houses and hotels.

78
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,890
I also swallowed the thimble,
the racecar,oh,and the shoe.

79
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:09,560
Eric and his older brother
don't always get along.

80
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,980
He wouldn't let me play monopoly w
ith him and his friends.

81
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,490
This way nobody could play.

82
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,260
- Yang,what do you recommend?
- Is this even surgical?

83
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:18,130
Yang.

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,180
track and inventory all the pieces,measure
the progress in x-rays,

85
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,690
- keep examining the stool.
- Very good.

86
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,090
Enjoy.

87
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,590
Dr. Bailey,isn't this more of a nurse's job?

88
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,400
Are you too good to help that boy?

89
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,840
Yes.

90
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,840
No.
Definitely not.

91
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,170
I-I just thought I'd be more help if
I was assisting you in a surgery.

92
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,250
No surgeries for you.

93
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,960
No,I'm-- I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

94
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,910
I don't understand why you erased
my name from the O.R. Board.

95
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:51,530
I-I'm--
I don't know what you're talking about.

96
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,650
No,don't do that.
Don't give me that fake confused look.

97
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,330
It irritates me.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

98
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,350
You erased my name from burke's
humpty dumpty surgery.

99
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:03,630
I know it,and you know it.
What I don't know is why.

100
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,110
I...

101
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,800
have no comment.

102
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,240
No surgeries.Yang

103
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,440
Okay,before you start,there are rules to this...

104
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:20,910
friendship thing or whatever.

105
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:23,160
The dirty mistresses club has rules?

106
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,630
Gosh,u'd think a bunch of dirty
mistresses would

107
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:28,310
be a little less uptight about t
hings like rules.

108
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:30,820
Number one,no flirting.

109
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,920
Second,no talking about derek.

110
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:35,810
"C"--
no giving me the face.

111
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,180
- The face?
- The mcsteamy face.

112
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,280
It doesn't work on me.
I'm immune.

113
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,290
You know,if I'd gone off to the woods,
I would have invited you to keep me warm.

114
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,580
Breaking rules one,two and three.

115
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,650
Oh!
Izzie!

116
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:56,870
Sydney.

117
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,080
- You're my counselor.
- Peer counselor. We're equals.

118
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,360
How are you?

119
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,340
Fine.
I'm fine.

120
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,260
Now that is "outside izzie" talking.
Okay?

121
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,210
How's "inside izzie"?

122
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,730
so...
you and derek,you guys together or...

123
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:27,260
just answer the question,and I'll stop asking.

124
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,920
Derek and I are taking some space.

125
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,960
You're taking space from each other,
or he's taking some space from you?

126
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,200
Derek and I--
there's just a lot of water under the...

127
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,400
thing or something.
Whatever.

128
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,010
my knight in shining poly-cotton.

129
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,110
Morning,donna.
Vicky.

130
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,370
- How was the trip?
- Smooth,perfect.

131
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,330
Speak for yourself.

132
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:52,000
She's still having some penis issues.

133
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,150
I'm sorry?

134
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:58,320
Am I missing something?

135
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:03,290
I believe you're missing the fact that Dr. Sloan
is planning to remove my husband's penis this afternoon.

136
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,500
Oh.Uh...
and your husband is?

137
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,370
Right here.

00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,190

139
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,360
daniel gibson,34,in for sexual
reassignment surgery,

140
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,250
donna,not daniel.She's been living
as donna for two years.Come on,grey.

141
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:34,930
So essentially today,
we are inverting his,uh,her,uh--

142
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,260
her penis.
That's okay.You'll get it.

143
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,760
you know the steps for a vaginoplasty?

144
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,310
Not exactly.

145
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,320
Well,if you want to get in on
this operation today,you better learn.

146
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Don't paany attention to him.
You' doing very well.

147
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,490
Better than I did when I first found out.

148
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,950
We just need to run a few pre-op labs,
make sure everything's in working order.

149
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,070
And then surgery...
today?

150
00:07:56,490 --> 00:07:58,120
Yeah.

151
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:01,240
Big day,donna.
You excited?

152
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:04,290
Excited doesn't begin to cover it.

153
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,330
You're gonna do great.

154
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,550
That is a nice-looking picnic basket.

155
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:36,300
Ah,thank you.
The concierge at the hotel put it together.

156
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,170
We got crackers,uh,pt?

157
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:41,740
and an assortment of seattle soft cheeses.

158
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,410
No,thanks.

159
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:46,010
Dude,he brought silverware.

160
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,610
you should talk.
Have you ever been camping before?

161
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,760
- What?
- A t-shirt and sneakers?

162
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,700
- You'll freeze your ass off.
- So? I'm wearing a jacket.

163
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,970
Just do me a favor.

164
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,270
Don't come crawling to me in the middle
of the night when you want to huddle for warmth.

165
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,050
That's a good-looking tent,joe.

166
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,410
Uh,you and walter got room for one more?

167
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,640
I thought you'd be sleeping with
one of the doctors.

168
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:17,580
Well,preston's already got o'malley
for a roommate,and,um...

169
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:22,620
just between you and me,um,
those other tents are pretty puny.

170
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,110
Well,walter and I were sort of wanting
to share this one,just the two of us.

171
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,060
But I guess if you really want to...

172
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,700
chief,I-I don't think you really...

173
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,250
they've offered,karev.

174
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,750
Chief,they want to be alone.

175
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,240
oh!

176
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,810
So you are,um...

177
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,910
uh,chief.

178
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,920
That's wonderful.
Man love.

179
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,550
it's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

180
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:59,410
M-my--
myousin's gay,so I'm--
I'm hip.

181
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:01,750
D "brokeback mountain," and all of that.

182
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,100
- who's ready to go fishing?
- Uh,me.

183
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:15,700
guess what I'm doing today.
Removing a man's penis.

184
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:18,380
You got an S.R.S.?
Seriously?

185
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,280
He's,uh--
she,she--

186
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,710
is one of sloan's patients.

187
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,310
Oh,god.
That should be me.

188
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:27,070
I should be turning a penis into a vagina.
That should be my penis.

189
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,120
I have to hide.

190
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,840
Sydney is my peer counselor.

191
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,120
"Heal with love" sydney.

192
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,100
Yeah,I'm supposed to be shadowing
her and dialoguing all day,

193
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,600
unless I can come up with a good
medical reason not to.

194
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,230
Anybody?
Anything?

195
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,820
couple of houses and the dog.
That's nine pieces so far.

196
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,570
I love the dog.

197
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:54,040
I'm always the dog when I play monopoly.

198
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,370
uh,I got a page.

199
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,120
Jamie carr--
she slipped and fell in the shower this morning.

200
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,730
I can't see my own feet.
I...did this.

201
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,800
Ooh,nasty break.

202
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,930
She hasn't had any meds for the pain?

203
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,970
She refused.
She's toughing it out.

204
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:18,300
Oh,don't do that.
Don't tough it out.Just say yes.

205
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,920
Well,the baby--

206
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,680
I-I know Dr. Montgomery said it was all right.

207
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,730
But I'll suffer.

208
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,700
Is he okay?
I...

209
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:31,450
he was kicking like crazy,and--
and now--

210
00:11:31,450 --> 00:11:33,510
it's possible that he's just sleeping.

211
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,920
So...
our son sleeps.

212
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,080
he's just sleeping,jamie.

213
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,220
- Do I need a cast?
- Definitely.

214
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,370
But first we need to straighten the bones.

215
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,110
We'll just put your arm in this kind of fancy sling,
and use gravity to help realign the bones.

216
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,730
Could you excuse me just a moment?
I'll be-- I've got A...

217
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,390
trade you?

218
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,670
Vicky.

219
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,990
Inrance forms.

220
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,470
Donna gets his surgeries,and I do the forms.

221
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,290
Super fun.

222
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,320
Well,you seem to be handling
this remarkably well.

223
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,240
Well,I left at first...

224
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,980
when she...

225
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,480
when he told me.

226
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,380
You plan a life together,you know,

227
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,480
kids,and suddenly,
that's allut the window.

228
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,760
Suddenly your husband is this
other girl in your house

229
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,530
who's borrowing your eyeliner and waxing her legs.

230
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:42,020
But you came back.

231
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,060
Why?

232
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,170
Honestly,right now I have no idea.

233
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,650
I'm really gonna miss the penis.

234
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:08,380
you okay?

235
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:10,540
Yeah,I'm fine.
I'm okay.I'm good.

236
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,790
don't make me climb over this stall.

237
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,870
I'll do it,but I'll be really pissed
'cause I don't know you that well.

238
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,630
you're not okay.

239
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,500
Oh,I don't know why...

240
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,260
there's no reason that this should
affect me this much.

241
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,480
I'm used to this.
I am,but...

242
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,560
used to what?

243
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,140
That woman.

244
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:41,470
Yesterday,she's just as healthy as can be.

245
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,020
Uh,and today...

246
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,940
today her baby's dead.

247
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,830
so,uh...

248
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:08,240
how long you and walter been together?

249
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,920
Ten years,on and off.

250
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,890
But now,definitely on.

251
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,930
Thinking about kids.

252
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,490
That's a big step.

253
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,160
You have kids?

254
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:24,330
No.
Oh,I work a lot.

255
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,120
Adele and I,w--

256
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:32,400
well,she always said she didn't
want to raise kids alone.

257
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,650
Walter says the same thing.

258
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,970
He does?

259
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,970
Well,I'm always working at the bar.
But what are you gonna do,right?

260
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,550
If I'm not there,who's gonna run the place?

261
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,500
Exactly.

262
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,660
But walter...

263
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,440
if I have to make a change,I'll do it.

264
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,000
I can't imagine my life without him,you know?

265
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,350
Very nice,o'malley.

266
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,930
At least once a month,my dad would take me
and my brothers to white river.

267
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,200
Well,your dad taught you well.

268
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,850
How are you and,uh,Dr. Torres doing these days?

269
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,600
Good.
She doesn't know it yet,but we are.

270
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:18,140
Excellent,even.

271
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,690
For a while,uh,she wanted,I don't know,

272
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:27,140
a certain level of commitment,
and I just didn't feel that I was re--

273
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,610
now I am,though.

274
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:30,720
- So you're stepping up?
- I'm stepping up.

275
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,880
You knew,right,when it was
the right time with you and cristina?

276
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,650
Right.

277
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,140
You okay?

278
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,040
Absolutely.

279
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,110
- Because,uh--
- we're here to fish,remember?

280
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,890
Right.

281
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:51,470
I'm gonna see if I can get a better
bite downstream.

282
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,990
Okay.

283
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:00,670
I'm sorry,Donna.XXXXXXXXX

284
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,690
- Breast cancer?
- I'm sorry.

285
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:04,620
I'm really...

286
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,490
the needle aspiration showed abnormal
cells in your breast tissue.

287
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:12,050
Rare,but it happens.

288
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,760
Well,so the hormones I've been taking are
essentially giving me cancer?

289
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,250
Yes.That's why we need to stop
the hormone therapy and start the treatment.

290
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,470
Or the cancer will get worse.

291
00:16:27,010 --> 00:16:28,590
The operation?

292
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,230
There'd really be no point.

293
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:34,660
Once we stop the hormones,your breasts
will shrink,your facial hair will grow back.

294
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,110
She'll become a man again.

295
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,690
What if I do the operation,
keep taking the hormones?

296
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:42,190
What--
what happens then?

297
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:46,300
Donna you really want to treat this now
while it's still in its early stages.

298
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,960
So if I keep taking the hormones...

299
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,450
you'd be feeding the cancer.

300
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,240
I could die?

301
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,910
Are you saying if I become a woman,
I could die?

302
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,540
They are a happy couple.

303
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,270
Look at them.
They love each other.

304
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,990
They should have everything.

305
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,700
happy people should have...

306
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,810
happy things happen to them.

307
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,700
- I gotta go tell 'em.
- Wait.

308
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,670
the moment you tell them,
they won't be happy anymore.

309
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,960
Give 'em a few more minutes.

310
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,840
Let 'em be happy...

311
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:40,490
a few more minutes.

312
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:47,400
So you're gettin' back with callie?

313
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,610
Yeah.

314
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,750
Trust me,man,I don't think you
really want to do that.

315
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:55,890
- Really?
- Really.

316
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:01,880
I guess when I get back,I'm gonna tell her
that we shouldn't see each othernymore,

317
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,790
and then when she asks why,
I'm just gonna say,

318
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:08,140
"well,alex karev thinks our relationship
isn't such a good idea.¡±

319
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:10,300
You think that'll do the trick?

320
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:12,500
Fine.
Suit yourself.

321
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:19,740
This was my camping trip.
I was gonna come alone.

322
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,150
So why did you invite me?

323
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:25,030
Because...
it's a guy trip,you know?

324
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,650
Mountain men.

325
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:33,030
- You don't have any friends,do you?
- Of course I have friends.

326
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,380
- Guy friends?
- Yes.

327
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,430
I just need peace...

328
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,990
space.
I have a right to space.

329
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:48,660
And you go and invite half the hospital.

330
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,460
That's because I have guy friends.

331
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,630
There you are.

332
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,600
I have been looking all over.

333
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,240
Oh,Dr. Yang needed some help with this patient.
She needed some help.

334
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,840
oh,well...
patient care always comes first.

335
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,850
- uh,what...
- oh,I'll just wait.

336
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,570
- Wait?
- Yeah,for you to finish,and then we'll dialogue.

337
00:19:24,970 --> 00:19:27,870
So...
what happens with donna now?

338
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,880
She goes back to being an unhappy
man who's stuck with a penis.

339
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,290
There are millions of us out there.

340
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,290
- You're unhappy with your penis?
- I could be a lot less unhappy.

341
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,410
Maybe it's for the best that he's taking some space.
Maybe...

342
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:46,180
you two aren't meant to be together.

343
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,620
Look,derek...

344
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:51,170
on the outside,he holds it all together,

345
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:54,490
but he's damaged goods,meredith.

346
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:57,660
It's my fault.
I damaged him,maybe forever.

347
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,600
You really want to drink from a poisoned well?

348
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,390
Dr. Sloan...
you have to talk to her.

349
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,200
Donna says she wants to
go through with the operation.

350
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,850
Joe and walter got tired of not
catching any fish.

351
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,980
They went for a hike.

352
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,990
What do you make of that?

353
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,430
- Joe and walter?
- Oh,no,no,no.

354
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,400
Joe and walter are great.
I mean that we haven't caught any fish.

355
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,490
- Any theories?
- Just one--

356
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:31,600
fish generally don't like to go where
there's a lot of noise.

357
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,290
- You notice anything going on with burke?
- No.

358
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,720
'Cause before,I thought I saw--

359
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,720
what are you doing?

360
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,190
You don't use bait when you're casting.

361
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:46,460
It's gonna fall off before it hits the water.
Here.

362
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,070
What are you--
here,here,here,here,here.

363
00:20:48,630 --> 00:20:50,690
What you want to--
she's sleeping with sloan,dude.

364
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,090
- What?
- Callie.

365
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:54,320
She's sleeping with sloan.

366
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,200
- No,she's not.
- Torres is doing sloan.

367
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,620
You better take that back.

368
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,040
yeah,people chatting,laughing,
moving around,that sort of thing?

369
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:12,690
That sort of thing let's the fish know
that they're not alone.

370
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,730
- That's the theory.
- So I invited other people?

371
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:18,340
I'm just saying,it's not a frat party.

372
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,380
take it back!
Nothing to take back.

373
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,040
Oh,for god's sake.
What are you guys doing?

374
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:25,200
Break it up!
Break it up!

375
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,020
I don't condone fighting.
I don't like fighting.

376
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:33,270
I think it is pointlessand foolish.

377
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,160
But you two idiotsseem determined
to beat the hellout of each other.

378
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,160
So if you're gonna do it,
you're gonna do itby my rules.

379
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,970
Rules?

380
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,710
Yes, o'malley, rules,
to help you protect your hands

381
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,180
- so you don't do irreparabledamage to them...
- you're dead.

382
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,560
Damage that would endyour careers
before they even started.

383
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:55,150
So with that in mind,
weegonna do open-handed combat.

384
00:21:55,170 --> 00:21:56,190
- A slap fight?
- A slap fight?

385
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,920
Open-handed combat.

386
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,850
- this is ridiculous.
- There willbe no scratching,

387
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,040
- no biting.
- Karev is gonna kill him.

388
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,630
- Not necessarily.
- also no punching,

389
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,550
no kicking,no wrestling movesof any kind.

390
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,890
Now any questions?

391
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,970
- That doesn't leave uswith much.
- All right.

392
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,250
- O'malley's a scrapper.
- A scrapper?

393
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,130
He's gonna destroy him.

394
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,910
He's tougher than he looks--
silent, but deadly.

395
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,370
This is immature and stupid.

396
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:25,250
- I think you'd agree with me.

- They're letting offsome steam.

397
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,260
This is why you don't
haveany guy friends.

398
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:30,210
Yeah, this is why
I should've come alone.

399
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,490
Ready? let's go.

400
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,720
I've wanted thissince I can remember.

401
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,740
I've waited forever.
I'm not stopping now.

402
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:36,660
Donna, listen to me--

403
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,470
if you don't dothe operation,I'm gonna
go to new yorkand find another doctor.

404
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,810
You're gonna have a very hardtime
finding a surgeon--

405
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,730
I'll find one.

406
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,140
donna, I'm tryingto save your life.

407
00:22:45,150 --> 00:22:46,750
As a man.

408
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:49,570
I am not a man.

409
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,190
I'll fight the cancer.
I'll just fight it as a woman.

410
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:55,620
For god's sake,wake up, daniel!

411
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:00,070
My name is donna.

412
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:06,650
I'm not gonna stand by
and watch you kill yourself.

413
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,330
I need vicky to love me.

414
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:28,740
But I need her to love...
me.

415
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:34,010
oh, my god.Please, tell me
it's gonnastop hurting soon.

416
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,520
You're almost done.

417
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:39,090
when our son's 15,and he's yelling at you
that you never didanything for him,

418
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,780
you can guilt himwith the wrist.

419
00:23:47,790 --> 00:23:50,900
ted, jamie, I needto talk to you...

420
00:23:53,490 --> 00:23:57,600
- about the baby.
- Dr. Montgomery...

421
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:04,290
you have to say it.

422
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:07,900
I won't believe itunless you say it.

423
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:11,870
You have to say it.

424
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,240
Thanks for this, izzie.
Thank you.

425
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:28,050
No good deedgoes unpunished.

426
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:29,810
"Good deed"?
You're making me digthrough crap.

427
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,290
It's not like I asked her
to spend the day with me.

428
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:39,180
How's it goin' in there?
Any luck?

429
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:45,760
Okay, I can't havethat grinning puppet heads
tare at me another second,so just go.

430
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,690
- Cristina.
- Hey, this is my crap.

431
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,700
This is my crap.Bailey assigned me
this crap.You get sydney.

432
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:54,290
Fine.Come on, sydney.
We can go.

433
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,810
Okeydokey, smokey.

434
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:10,820
man, I thought my brotherand I
had problems,but you two are morons.

435
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:15,260
Okay, well, swallowing monopolyieces
wasn't exactlya genius move.

436
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,740
You could'vereally hurt yourself.

437
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,100
I didn't, did I?

438
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,170
Now my mom'sgonna make my brother
let me playall the monopoly I want.

439
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,240
I get to play.It's all
that matters,getting to play.

440
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,360
And that makes you smart?

441
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,050
You're fishing through my poop.
How smart are you?

442
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,320
That's right, karev.
Whatever it was,don't take it back.

443
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,130
you don't even knowwhy they're fighting.

444
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,240
arms up, o'malley.
Don't drop your arms.

445
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:49,940
Hey, hey, no wrestling.
No wrestling.Come on, come on.

446
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:52,580
- This is stupid.
- George is defendinghis honor.

447
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:55,800
Karev said that, uh, sloan's been
sleeping with torres.

448
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:58,080
- He what?
- O'malley, arms up.

449
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:17,720
next time,we're not going
campingwith straight guys.

450
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:26,550
so basically,you're getting paid
to look at penises all day.

451
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,810
I'm studying for mcsteamy's
reassignment surgery.

452
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,410
- You like mcsteamy.
- Yes.

453
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,390
I mean, no.
No, not like that.

454
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:40,510
Just...you know,he thinks
I'm better offwithout derek's baggage.

455
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:42,410
Thinks there'stoo much history there.

456
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:46,700
Maybe in his own sick,twisted way,
he'sust tryingto protect me.

457
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:51,250
Protect you?
Maybe.

458
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:55,800
Hey, um...

459
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,720
uh, when your motherwas first
diagnosed with alzheimer'S...

460
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,970
uh, why didn't youtell anyone?

461
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:06,600
Uh, she asked me not to.Why?

462
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,610
So you think it was rightto keep her secret?

463
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,190
Yes.
Why?

464
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,720
Even if it meantyou had to fish crap
out of a toilet all dayand probablyfor years to come?

465
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,180
Okay, rewind.
Start at the beginning.

466
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,480
- whose secretare you keeping?
- Oh, wait.

467
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,170
what the hell happened?

468
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,560
He was fine one minute,and then he just--

469
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:31,550
eric, lay down, okay?

470
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,990
oh, his abdomen is rigid.

471
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:39,900
There's blood in the vomit.
He's perfed.Page bailey.

472
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:44,060
there's a lot of blood,but, uh,
it didn't penetratethe galea.

473
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:44,820
is that a good thing?

474
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,200
yeah, it means we don't
have to do deep stitches.

475
00:27:47,870 --> 00:27:50,980
- You're using a fishing hook?
- Ah, don't worry.

476
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:54,000
We sterilized it.
Also clipped off the barb.

477
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,850
It's good as a needle.

478
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,190
All right, wound's clean.

479
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,560
Just keep some pressureon there,
will you, chief?

480
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,230
Got it.

481
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,870
Okay, we're gonna dosome stitches now,
all right, walter?

482
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:03,880
- Is it gonna hurt?
- Yes.

483
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,990
It's okay.

484
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,460
karev, you wanna sew him up?

485
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,130
Oh, no.

486
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,750
No.No, forget it.

I want an attending.

487
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:13,720
thanks, dude.

488
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:16,010
We're doing some kindof crazy
macgyver surgeryin the middle of the woods.

489
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,780
I want what's bestfor my guy, okay?

490
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,260
No offense.

491
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:26,430
Don't worry.
Dr. Burke'sreally good at doing this.

492
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,570
Well, you are, right?

493
00:28:32,970 --> 00:28:34,290
Right.

494
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,030
there's stilla little bleeding there.

495
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,220
hold on, walter.

496
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:59,370
You got it?

497
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,150
I always have it.

498
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,810
you want something?

499
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,520
He is my patient.
I've been with him all day.

500
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:26,550
If there's any chance that
I can get in on this surgery,I'd really--

501
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:29,350
why'd you erasemy name from the board?

502
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:31,880
I don't knowwhat you're talking about.

503
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:35,640
You really wanna go head-to-head with me on this?
You really want that?

504
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:41,780
Right now, this second,in this moment,
you chose your own fate.

505
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,560
so tell me about denny.

506
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,060
What?

507
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,140
Yeah, it helps to, uh...

508
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,470
to talk about what happened.

509
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,200
- So as much as you can--
- okay, we are done here.

510
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:12,060
Izzie, really...

511
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,770
- it helps to share.
- No.

512
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,690
I don't wantto share with you.

513
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,810
Do you know what I've beendoing all day?
Sifting through feces.

514
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,060
I would rather sift throughfeces
than talk to you.

515
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,660
And now you bring up denny
like you want me to--to gossip with you.

516
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,870
Well, I understand this--
this must be difficult.

517
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,810
You understand?
Really?

518
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,450
What,you cut someone's lvad wire?

519
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:34,290
You fell in love
with a manand he died?

520
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,130
Well, no, but--

521
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:38,500
then how in the hell
could you possibly know?

522
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:44,260
grey,what's our next step?

523
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,760
Continue the primary incision
of the ventral sideof the shaft.

524
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,110
I am surprised you agreed
to do the surgery.

525
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,150
People don't come to me
to fix what's on the outside.

526
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:59,070
They come to me to fix
what's on the inside.

527
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:04,300
If that means giving someone
a straighter noseor bigger breasts or...

528
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,280
if that helpsa person get by...

529
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:10,350
I don't run.
I don't hide.

530
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:12,430
I don't take space.

531
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,660
Well, don't look at me.
I didn't start it.

532
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,660
Karev.

533
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,750
What?I just came out here
to have some fun.

534
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,330
Then the guy gets all over me
about what I'm wearing.

535
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,650
He just rubs methe wrong way.

536
00:31:30,670 --> 00:31:32,360
You're on a camping trip.

537
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:34,900
You're supposed to be
enjoying the great outdoors.

538
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,680
You know I grew upin a bar?

539
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,600
Literally in a bar.

540
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:44,760
My dad was always doing one of two things in there--
playing music or drinking.

541
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:47,520
Dude never even took meto the park.

542
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,490
I just figuredthis was my chance
to get out with the guys.

543
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,300
The one time I try...

544
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,720
you wanted to bea different person.

545
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:02,770
- They're a happy couple.
- Yeah.

546
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,200
I miss my wife.

547
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,570
You have high standards.

548
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:16,380
you have high standards.

549
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,500
Your standards are too high.

550
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:23,000
You...
make people out to be...

551
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,240
and people make mistakes.

552
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,020
Your standards are too high.

553
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,680
You see a flaw, you attack.

554
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,140
Wait, wait.

555
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,860
So you're saying that, uh,
if cristinadid something like--

556
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,460
cristina and I are a team.

557
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,710
We are a team.

558
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:48,880
You're either part of a team
or you play alonefor the rest of your life.

559
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:01,400
good.
Push, jamie.

560
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,310
okay...

561
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:08,270
I need you to pushone more time, jamie.

562
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,460
Ted.

563
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:12,720
one more time.
Push.

564
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,170
push.

565
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:19,230
push.
Push.

566
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,690
Good.
We got it.

567
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:12,360
so that mark sloan...

568
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:17,790
- he's bad news.
- Ah, he's a cancer.He infects everybody.

569
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,060
What are we, three hoursout of seattle?
And still...

570
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:21,940
he infects everything.

571
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:25,430
You know, I thoughtif I just got away
for a while by myself,

572
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,930
I'd get some answers,
get a fresh start.

573
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:32,360
Fresh starts--no such thing.

574
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:35,650
Any other wordsof wisdom there, chief?

575
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,710
I'm living in a hotel.

576
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:44,000
I buy most of my clothesfrom the hotel gift shop,
and my wife won't speak to me.

577
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,220
oh, don't look at me.

578
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:47,550
I came out here for
the same reasons you did.

579
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,380
I have no wisdom.

580
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,300
There is no wisdom here.

581
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:54,260
So in other words...

582
00:34:55,410 --> 00:34:57,110
we're all a bunch of idiots.

583
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,250
- yes.
- yes.

584
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,980
Who wants to go home?

585
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,020
I lost a kid...

586
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,310
my first year.

587
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,870
It was my fault.
And I just couldn'T...

588
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,870
so I had a breakdown.

589
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:53,150
They gave me time off,and when I came back,
I put a smile on my face,

590
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,180
and everybody thoughtI was fine.

591
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:58,950
I lost a kid.

592
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,300
It comes in waves, izzie.

593
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,130
There's a lull,and then...

594
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,260
another wave hits you.

595
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:10,410
I wasn't trying to pry.

596
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,180
I just wanted you to knowthat...

597
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:15,550
it's okaynot to be fine s-sometimes.

598
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,500
I miss him.

599
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,410
All the time, I miss him.

600
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:27,410
It's not waves,
it's constant,all the time.

601
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:33,760
And I walk through the doorsof this hospital,
and I want to be here,I do.

602
00:36:34,410 --> 00:36:36,090
But I...

603
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:38,830
I don't know...

604
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:45,060
if I can be a surgeon again,and I can't talk
about itbecause it scares me too much.Okay?

605
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,370
Okay.

606
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:58,640
- You came back.
- I was heading home.

607
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:01,470
I was on my wayto the airport,and then...

608
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:07,060
you know, you asked before
why I came backthe first time.

609
00:37:07,070 --> 00:37:09,390
You know,I tried not to.

610
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:12,540
I went on dates.

611
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:15,760
I had a lotof great first dateswith...

612
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,460
guys who wereplanning to stay guys.

613
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:24,840
but, you know,you have a great date,and you
want to go and tellyour best friend about it.

614
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,040
And my best friendis daniel.

615
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,700
Donna.

616
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,480
And then you havea few bad dates, and...

617
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,530
she's my best friend.

618
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,450
She knows me.
She loves me.

619
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:50,310
She'S...
my husband.

620
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:58,180
At the end of the day,it's donna,

621
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,930
even when she hurts me,
even when I hate her.

622
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,060
She's who you wantto talk to.

623
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,430
Not all wounds are superficial.

624
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,650
So...

625
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,220
you're sleeping with sloan.

626
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,700
- was.
- Me, too.Was.

627
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:33,180
Which is just a hailstorm
of self-loathingand misery.

628
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,470
yeah.

629
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,290
hey, you want to, um...

630
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,690
get a drink or something?

631
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:54,000
- some other time then.
- Definitely.

632
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,860
Most wounds run deeper than we can imagine.

633
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,960
He'll make a full recovery.

634
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:07,910
You can't see them with the naked eye.

635
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:16,580
- You're back.
- Yes.

636
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,870
I'm glad you're back.

637
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,630
Me, too.

638
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,360
George, we need to talk.

639
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,540
- Yeah, I think we do.
- It's about your dad,george.

640
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,840
My dad?

641
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:40,010
And then there are the wounds
that take us by surprise.

642
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:50,940
so...this could be just a drink,
or this could bemore than a drink.

643
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:54,360
- I cannot start somethingwith you.
- You could.

644
00:39:56,510 --> 00:40:01,120
start over, meredith.
Start fresh.

645
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,130
saved by the bell.

646
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,090
Order me another beer.

647
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,020
Hi.I'm derek shepherd.

648
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,590
what are you doing?

649
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:36,140
Well, we met at this bar.
You remember?

650
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,290
We met, and we--well, you said, uh,
"I'm just a girl."

651
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,950
I said, "I'm just a guy."

652
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,050
And we started this thing.

653
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:45,630
We started this thing.

654
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,980
You didn't know anythingabout me--
the good, the bad, the wife.

655
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,260
You didn't even know my name.

656
00:40:54,430 --> 00:40:56,300
You didn't know me.

657
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,680
I want you to know me.

658
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,860
I want to start overfrom the beginning.

659
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:08,890
So, hi.
Derek shepherd.

660
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:14,530
You walked away.
And now it's too late.

661
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,500
There's too much water
under the thingor whatever.

662
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,030
Meredith...

663
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:25,000
please.

664
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:30,320
The trick with any kind of wound or disease

665
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:35,750
is to dig down and find
the real source of the injury.

666
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,090
Hi.
I'm meredith grey.

667
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:54,030
- Very nice to meet you,meredith.
- It's nice to meet you.

668
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,420
And once you've found it...

669
00:41:59,890 --> 00:42:03,160
try like hell to heal that sucker.
