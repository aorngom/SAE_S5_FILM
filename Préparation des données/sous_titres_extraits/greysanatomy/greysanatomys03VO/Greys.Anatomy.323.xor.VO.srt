1
00:00:09,014 --> 00:00:10,535
I just never thought about it.

2
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:13,850
What I would do, you know?
What the dream would be if I...

3
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:15,957
couldn't have my dream.

4
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:18,342
Empty office.

5
00:00:19,873 --> 00:00:21,209
What are we doing?
Thought we were gonna lunch.

6
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,361
Why are we still sitting here?

7
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:24,296
We're doing what I do
when I get depressed.

8
00:00:24,484 --> 00:00:26,400
Just wait.
What time do you have?

9
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,829
It's 5 to 1:00.

10
00:00:28,692 --> 00:00:30,701
You know what? I'm glad
I can't have a child.

11
00:00:31,086 --> 00:00:33,161
With my luck, I'd probably
have a kid with two heads.

12
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,749
It... It's actually better.
I'm grateful.

13
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:37,752
I don't have to think about it.
The option is...

14
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:39,979
off the table.

15
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,711
- What time do you have?
- 5 to 1:00.

16
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:44,541
You people are obsessed with time.

17
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:50,168
Here he comes.

18
00:01:01,613 --> 00:01:02,618
Hi, Dell.

19
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:45,970
Have a nice... surf.

20
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:47,616
I'll see you guys after lunch?

21
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:01,785
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

22
00:02:01,823 --> 00:02:03,455
Admit it.
You feel better.

23
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,368
And if not,
there's another showing in an hour,

24
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,782
and it's wet.

25
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:13,519
My brain is bleeding?

26
00:02:13,674 --> 00:02:15,819
How could my brain have been
bleeding since the accident?

27
00:02:15,846 --> 00:02:16,935
Well, it could be
from the trauma,

28
00:02:16,954 --> 00:02:18,913
but it also could be
from one of your surgeries.

29
00:02:19,286 --> 00:02:22,112
Dr. Shepherd, I've been living
in this hospital long enough to know

30
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:24,084
when there's something
one of you isn't saying.

31
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:26,845
Because of the location of the bleed,

32
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:28,793
you need to be awake
during surgery.

33
00:02:29,022 --> 00:02:30,233
You'll be sedate alert,

34
00:02:30,248 --> 00:02:32,417
but it can be
a really dangerous process.

35
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,913
There's a lot about the brain
we don't know.

36
00:02:33,932 --> 00:02:34,993
So...

37
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:38,364
I could potentially
get my memory back?

38
00:02:38,535 --> 00:02:39,624
Mm. It's possible.

39
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:42,063
Amnesia can be a symptom,
but I think it's a long shot.

40
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:43,960
I'll do some brain mapping
and see if anything happens,

41
00:02:43,979 --> 00:02:46,373
- but...
- But I could get my memory back?

42
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:49,878
You're back? What happened?

43
00:02:50,187 --> 00:02:51,314
She's got a fever,

44
00:02:51,324 --> 00:02:54,460
- and I think I hear a small murmur.
- A heart murmur?

45
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:55,727
Don't be dramatic.

46
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:57,708
At least it's not the hiccups.

47
00:02:57,727 --> 00:02:59,539
Could be complications
from the endoscopy.

48
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,941
Bacterial endocarditis?

49
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:03,573
You'll have to get tests,
and if they come back positive,

50
00:03:03,582 --> 00:03:05,260
you'll be admitted
for I.V. antibiotics.

51
00:03:05,289 --> 00:03:06,660
Which should knock it right out.

52
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:09,443
See? I told you.
Don't be dramatic.

53
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:17,538
Hey, hey.
You're supposed to wait for me.

54
00:03:17,568 --> 00:03:19,981
I'm going crazy
just sitting there.

55
00:03:20,292 --> 00:03:21,738
Hey, look, I'd be freaked out, too,

56
00:03:21,751 --> 00:03:23,383
if somebody was about to
open up my head.

57
00:03:23,402 --> 00:03:25,143
But Dr. Shepherd, he's the best.

58
00:03:25,198 --> 00:03:27,141
I can't hold my baby, right?

59
00:03:27,162 --> 00:03:29,181
She's...
She's in that incubator.

60
00:03:29,735 --> 00:03:32,674
And so the nurses told me
to talk to her. And I try.

61
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,196
Guess what.
Right now, I have nothing to say.

62
00:03:36,406 --> 00:03:39,589
You know, I don't even remember
what it feels like to be outside,

63
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:42,100
to have the wind on my face
or rain or...

64
00:03:42,412 --> 00:03:44,506
I know
the surgery is dangerous, but...

65
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,880
I'm not freaked.

66
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:48,289
- I can't wait.
- Well, there's no guarantee

67
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,095
the surgery's gonna
bring back your memory.

68
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:51,527
But there's a chance.

69
00:03:52,175 --> 00:03:53,358
It's better than nothing.

70
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,338
Good news.
Uh, Paul's lack of sex drive

71
00:03:58,423 --> 00:04:00,794
comes from a hormone imbalance.

72
00:04:00,885 --> 00:04:02,359
So Paul still likes sex?

73
00:04:02,378 --> 00:04:05,328
Yeah, well, he's a guy and
he's not dead, so I'm guessing yeah.

74
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,168
He... He just can't
do anything about it.

75
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:08,875
- And that's good news?
- The bad news is that

76
00:04:08,885 --> 00:04:10,070
there could be many causes

77
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:13,135
to this imbalance,
some more serious than others.

78
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:16,859
So final diagnosis and treatment
could be a lengthy process.

79
00:04:16,971 --> 00:04:18,304
We're gonna have to run
more tests.

80
00:04:18,323 --> 00:04:19,341
So it might be a while

81
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,804
before Paul can help Kathy...
take the edge off.

82
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,708
Tell her to try swimming.
It's easier on the knees.

83
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,014
So...

84
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:32,970
you're the quack.

85
00:04:33,295 --> 00:04:34,647
Uh, I went to med school.

86
00:04:34,735 --> 00:04:36,444
I'm also a licensed herbalist,

87
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:38,023
and I spent five years in China

88
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,544
learning alternative medicine.

89
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:42,312
Like I said... quack.

90
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:45,062
Come here.

91
00:04:45,565 --> 00:04:46,918
Unless you need to go
tell someone

92
00:04:46,936 --> 00:04:48,621
you saw goody Johnson
with the devil.

93
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,214
Okay.

94
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:54,317
- Lie down on the table.
- Why?

95
00:04:54,721 --> 00:04:56,463
I wanna show you
that I'm not a quack.

96
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:02,227
I'm not taking my clothes off.

97
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:04,743
Did I ask you
to take your clothes off?

98
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,023
Now...

99
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:26,880
You carry a lot of tension in your
shoulders  and above your right eye.

100
00:05:27,265 --> 00:05:28,561
What do you mean?

101
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:30,775
You're blocking
some serious emotion.

102
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,844
Hang on.

103
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,958
What... What are you doing?

104
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:47,811
Stop saying "Ow."
It doesn't hurt.

105
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:52,086
- Okay, I'm done.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

106
00:05:52,105 --> 00:05:53,955
Where you going?
You can't leave me here like this.

107
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:56,167
Lie there. Don't move.
Breathe.

108
00:05:56,306 --> 00:05:58,372
You're going to experience
a rush of emotion,

109
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,644
a release of... psychic pain.

110
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:12,164
Hello?

111
00:06:13,296 --> 00:06:14,329
Hello?

112
00:06:15,935 --> 00:06:17,352
I don't feel anything...

113
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,925
Except stupid for...

114
00:06:20,307 --> 00:06:23,020
letting a cute hippie boy
put needles in my face.

115
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:24,919
Hello!

116
00:06:26,314 --> 00:06:27,743
Yeah, Pete...

117
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,995
This isn't working.

118
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,567
I don't have any...

119
00:06:33,177 --> 00:06:34,247
psychic pain.

120
00:06:34,276 --> 00:06:36,042
I... I'm great.

121
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,547
Barren, but...

122
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,950
fan-freakin'-tastic.

123
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,358
You can come back now.

124
00:06:44,376 --> 00:06:47,918
I am not feeling any, you know,
rush of emotion or anything.

125
00:06:47,937 --> 00:06:50,732
I don't feel... anything.

126
00:06:57,177 --> 00:06:58,858
I don't feel anything at all.

127
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:06,313
I don't feel anything at all.

128
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:14,577
I hate L.A.

129
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:21,000
I heard Susan was back.
Is everything okay?

130
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:22,623
Oh, an infection.
She'll be fine.

131
00:07:22,645 --> 00:07:24,575
Oh, good, 'cause I figured
if anything was wrong,

132
00:07:24,585 --> 00:07:26,331
- you'd tell me.
- If it was serious, I would,

133
00:07:26,353 --> 00:07:28,062
in a very "letting you in"
sort of way.

134
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:30,193
- You know, it's weird.
- What?

135
00:07:30,362 --> 00:07:32,494
My father...
we're almost talking.

136
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:34,713
Really?

137
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:37,469
- How's the trailer?
- It's freezing.

138
00:07:38,329 --> 00:07:40,911
You want to eat later?
I'll bring something over.

139
00:07:41,187 --> 00:07:43,554
- Are you using me for central heating?
- Among other things.

140
00:07:43,585 --> 00:07:45,059
- Okay.
- All right.

141
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:50,514
Lisa?

142
00:07:50,598 --> 00:07:52,664
- I think something is wrong.
- She's in pain.

143
00:07:53,114 --> 00:07:55,351
- Lisa?
- Addison, something is not right.

144
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:58,236
- My god. I think I just wet my pants.
- No, your water broke.

145
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:00,316
- She's in labor, and it's coming fast.
- I'll call an ambulance.

146
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:01,427
Uh, go get Cooper.

147
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:03,737
And let the hospital know
we're coming and call the chief.

148
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:05,462
I don't want any problems
when I try to scrub in.

149
00:08:07,337 --> 00:08:09,149
- I need to push!
- Don't push.

150
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:10,633
Get her into labor
and delivery right away.

151
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:11,797
Jim, check her in.

152
00:08:15,292 --> 00:08:17,235
Is she okay?
Are they okay?

153
00:08:17,249 --> 00:08:18,469
- What happened?
- It's too early.

154
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:20,218
- She's not due for another month.
- Well, I'm guessing

155
00:08:20,228 --> 00:08:22,164
that the stress of you all
fighting and crowding her,

156
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:23,949
declaring yourselves the father
didn't help.

157
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,202
Move!

158
00:08:34,503 --> 00:08:35,949
Any word on Lisa and the baby?

159
00:08:37,516 --> 00:08:38,624
We're still waiting.

160
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:42,432
- Therapy sucks.
- Said the shrink.

161
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:44,494
No, I mean my particular
brand of therapy

162
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,315
might actually be...
full of crap.

163
00:08:48,064 --> 00:08:50,289
People talking about
their problems endlessly,

164
00:08:50,316 --> 00:08:52,316
telling people
to think positively,

165
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:54,548
- visualize their destiny.
- It doesn't work?

166
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:57,115
I think positively.
I visualize my destiny.

167
00:08:58,508 --> 00:09:00,217
And look, just look.

168
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:02,781
What am I lookin' at?

169
00:09:02,945 --> 00:09:03,950
Me...

170
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,536
My pathetic, miserable existence.

171
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:10,202
He left six months ago.

172
00:09:10,277 --> 00:09:11,714
He was a loser!

173
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,978
Do you know he peed a little bit
every time he coughed?

174
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:17,754
Like an incontinent old woman.

175
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:19,056
He smelled like pee.

176
00:09:20,046 --> 00:09:22,140
And there I was,
in the car, crying,

177
00:09:22,713 --> 00:09:24,046
and I'm a serious feminist.

178
00:09:24,711 --> 00:09:26,410
Not to mention, my no-sex couple?

179
00:09:26,801 --> 00:09:28,886
Turns out it was a hormone thing.
It's physical.

180
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:31,590
In the old days we would've
talked and talked and talked

181
00:09:31,609 --> 00:09:33,340
as Paul got sicker and sicker.

182
00:09:34,989 --> 00:09:36,989
My profession's becoming irrelevant.

183
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:40,010
Maybe it's a good thing.

184
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:42,657
People should just tell the truth
to the people in their lives.

185
00:09:42,739 --> 00:09:43,818
They can't.

186
00:09:44,141 --> 00:09:46,122
- If they could, we'd all be healthy.
- Like me.

187
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,559
You're not healthy.
You're in denial.

188
00:09:47,572 --> 00:09:48,680
I am not in denial.

189
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:50,646
You're in denial,
and you're angry.

190
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:52,121
You're the angriest man I know.

191
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:53,454
Is that why you won't sleep
with me?

192
00:09:53,463 --> 00:09:55,449
You're in denial, you're angry,

193
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:57,691
and you use sex
as weapon to deflect it.

194
00:10:01,576 --> 00:10:03,764
Now stimulating area 11.

195
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:06,416
Ava, can you name this object?

196
00:10:06,608 --> 00:10:08,448
Flowers, pink and blue.

197
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:10,883
Avoiding area 11.
Moving superiorly.

198
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:12,937
This will be area 12.

199
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:18,188
<i>Una cara con los ojos azules
y el pelo rubio.</i>

200
00:10:19,906 --> 00:10:22,026
- Was that spanish?
- Was it?

201
00:10:22,148 --> 00:10:23,631
Okay, I'm going on to 13.

202
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:26,869
<i>Une maison avec des galets rouges.</i>

203
00:10:28,412 --> 00:10:30,069
All right.
Now you're just showing off.

204
00:10:30,136 --> 00:10:31,948
Each language is stored in
a different area of the brain.

205
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:34,315
And as I stimulate them...
this will be 14.

206
00:10:34,351 --> 00:10:35,515
So this isn't from the surgery?

207
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,851
She actually speaks
spanish and french?

208
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:40,187
Alex... <i>ich möchte die nächste
Karte, das ist noch das Haus</i>

209
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,317
And german?

210
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:43,636
She's hypoventilating. Let's put
her under and work on the bleed.

211
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:45,153
Can't we keep going
just a few more minutes?

212
00:10:45,163 --> 00:10:46,910
Maybe she can get her memory
back along with the languages.

213
00:10:46,928 --> 00:10:48,412
If we don't control this bleed
she'll lose a lot more

214
00:10:48,431 --> 00:10:49,801
than her memory she'll die.

215
00:10:52,991 --> 00:10:55,495
- Why is this happening so fast?
- Uh, doctors?

216
00:10:55,966 --> 00:10:57,347
Cooper, she's crowning.

217
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:59,944
- All right, just don't push, Lisa.
- Oh, push? Okay.

218
00:10:59,964 --> 00:11:01,645
No! No, don't push, Lisa.

219
00:11:01,654 --> 00:11:02,921
The cord's wrapped
around the baby's neck.

220
00:11:02,943 --> 00:11:04,788
Oh, I'm sorry!
I can't help it!

221
00:11:05,302 --> 00:11:06,861
God! Oh!

222
00:11:11,021 --> 00:11:12,407
I'll hold her.
You clamp and cut.

223
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:13,806
- Okay.
- Is she okay?

224
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:15,496
Hang 20 of oxytocin.

225
00:11:17,213 --> 00:11:18,800
8 french suction catheter.

226
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,840
- Why isn't she crying?
- Cooper's gonna be working on her.

227
00:11:22,859 --> 00:11:24,737
We need to focus
on your right now, Lisa.

228
00:11:24,755 --> 00:11:26,319
Fortunately,
you're not bleeding that much,

229
00:11:26,336 --> 00:11:29,031
so we should be able to
remove the placenta by...

230
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:34,162
By... By what? By what?

231
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:35,812
- Put her under, now.
- What's going on?

232
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:38,490
Her uterus must have ruptured
because of the placenta accreta.

233
00:11:38,508 --> 00:11:40,433
- We have to open her up.
- No, no, no, no, no.

234
00:11:40,443 --> 00:11:42,319
- The baby's not crying.
- B.P.'s 58 over 32.

235
00:11:42,338 --> 00:11:43,845
Don't put me under
till the baby cries.

236
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:46,380
We don't have time, Lisa.
We have to put you under right now.

237
00:11:50,767 --> 00:11:52,006
Go, Addison.

238
00:11:52,823 --> 00:11:54,804
Hang two units
of B-positive and make sure

239
00:11:54,826 --> 00:11:57,495
we have plenty on standby.
She's gonna exsanguinate

240
00:11:57,514 --> 00:11:59,042
if we don't move quickly,
people. 10-blade.

241
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,866
Lisa lost a lot of blood.

242
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:09,195
We had to put the baby
on oxygen but...

243
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:10,655
they are both stable.

244
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,765
- Who's the father?
- What?

245
00:12:12,849 --> 00:12:14,691
You said you sent off
for the paternity test.

246
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,438
- Which one of us is the father?
- Did Lisa say anything,

247
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,968
her decision about the baby?

248
00:12:20,775 --> 00:12:23,216
Lisa lost a lot of blood,

249
00:12:23,311 --> 00:12:27,198
we had to put the baby on oxygen,
but they are both stable.

250
00:12:27,217 --> 00:12:29,518
I say it again
because it seems like

251
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:31,430
you didn't hear me
the first time.

252
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:34,405
They almost died.
Lisa... almost died.

253
00:12:34,507 --> 00:12:35,822
And so I didn't have time,

254
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:38,707
what, with, um,
trying to save her life,

255
00:12:38,893 --> 00:12:41,288
to pause and check on
the paternity test

256
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,285
or ask her about the baby's future.

257
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:45,081
What is wrong with you people?

258
00:12:46,138 --> 00:12:47,978
Can... Can we see the baby?

259
00:12:48,037 --> 00:12:51,952
No. None of you go near Lisa
or the baby until I say so.

260
00:12:51,963 --> 00:12:54,639
The child is not a possession
that you fight over.

261
00:12:56,569 --> 00:12:58,287
And by the way, not that you asked,

262
00:12:58,517 --> 00:13:01,156
it's a girl...
6 pounds, 9 ounces.

263
00:13:20,153 --> 00:13:21,186
I don't remember.

264
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,836
We got it, the bleed.

265
00:13:25,226 --> 00:13:26,493
You're gonna be fine.

266
00:13:26,818 --> 00:13:28,639
By the way, uh,
you rocked that surgery.

267
00:13:28,649 --> 00:13:29,991
You spoke three languages.

268
00:13:31,361 --> 00:13:32,920
I don't remember anything.

269
00:13:35,834 --> 00:13:37,243
The surgery was sup...

270
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,603
I th... I thought I would...

271
00:13:44,356 --> 00:13:45,746
What am I gonna do?

272
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:49,127
What if...
What if I never remember anything?

273
00:13:58,236 --> 00:13:59,362
You sick, O'Malley?

274
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,368
You feel fine.

275
00:14:02,545 --> 00:14:04,339
Take an aspirin
and get off my clean bed.

276
00:14:06,463 --> 00:14:08,106
You been married a long time, right?

277
00:14:08,468 --> 00:14:10,069
O'malley, I do not have time

278
00:14:10,106 --> 00:14:11,900
- to answer...
- Did you have doubts...

279
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,073
about your marriage?

280
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:15,955
I don't mean, uh, insecurities.

281
00:14:16,214 --> 00:14:18,862
- I mean really serious doubts.
- Dr. Bailey I need you to sign this

282
00:14:18,881 --> 00:14:20,233
before I can discharge bed ten.

283
00:14:20,252 --> 00:14:23,605
No. He's supposed to get
an I.V. dose before discharge.

284
00:14:23,624 --> 00:14:25,126
Why don't people listen?

285
00:14:30,989 --> 00:14:32,623
Someday you'll have
to explain to me

286
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:34,210
how antibiotics actually work.

287
00:14:34,316 --> 00:14:35,874
They are miraculous.

288
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:37,241
Good afternoon.

289
00:14:37,337 --> 00:14:38,942
Dr. Bailey asked me to look in.

290
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:40,483
Everything looks good.

291
00:14:40,565 --> 00:14:43,879
We are going to take you
to radiology to get a central line

292
00:14:43,936 --> 00:14:46,661
to continue your
I.V. antibiotics outpatient.

293
00:14:50,085 --> 00:14:52,151
Hey, will you show
your dad the cafeteria?

294
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,901
Sure. We're on to you, you know?

295
00:14:55,192 --> 00:14:56,347
What?

296
00:15:02,646 --> 00:15:03,697
Dr. Bailey.

297
00:15:03,911 --> 00:15:07,160
I was... Looking for some privacy,
and, uh...

298
00:15:07,835 --> 00:15:10,286
I didn't think anyone would come
looking for me down here.

299
00:15:10,305 --> 00:15:12,746
- I apologize.
- Problem. Take your time.

300
00:15:13,609 --> 00:15:14,679
Uh, Dr. Bailey.

301
00:15:15,237 --> 00:15:16,251
Yeah.

302
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:18,382
Um, you've been married

303
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:20,086
a long time now, right?

304
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:22,588
Do you think it matters
if one person...

305
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:25,773
Is... Is more ready?

306
00:15:25,869 --> 00:15:27,221
O'Malley!

307
00:15:29,938 --> 00:15:31,318
Come here.

308
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:35,379
Yes. Hi, Dr. Burke.

309
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,849
I want the two of you
to talk to each other.

310
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:40,703
I want you to talk to each other
and leave my marriage out of it.

311
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:42,903
I also want you to leave
my clinic out of it.

312
00:15:42,988 --> 00:15:44,727
And by that, I mean get out.

313
00:15:44,905 --> 00:15:48,055
I need the space, I need the peace,
I need the quiet, and I need it now.

314
00:15:48,073 --> 00:15:49,679
- Sorry.
- Yeah, right, sorry.

315
00:15:56,169 --> 00:15:57,982
Cooper, you're blocking the caffeine.

316
00:16:00,002 --> 00:16:01,317
He's blocking the caffeine.

317
00:16:01,982 --> 00:16:03,925
Cooper, if you move,
I'll give you a cookie.

318
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:06,094
Hey, did something go wrong
with Lisa's surgery?

319
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:07,302
No, uh, we handled it.

320
00:16:07,442 --> 00:16:09,531
Addison...
She is, uh, pretty excellent.

321
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,615
She's pretty excellent.

322
00:16:14,184 --> 00:16:16,381
Okay, only because
you've sighed twice...

323
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,268
What's the matter, Cooper?

324
00:16:22,579 --> 00:16:24,777
I don't go to hookers.
I don't go to strip clubs.

325
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:27,486
I meet women on the Internet
that want to meet me.

326
00:16:27,757 --> 00:16:30,761
So I like 'em a little younger
and a little dirtier.

327
00:16:31,179 --> 00:16:32,250
Is that wrong?

328
00:16:35,464 --> 00:16:38,002
- It's wrong?
- You need to meet a grown-up.

329
00:16:38,026 --> 00:16:39,486
You need to date
someone your own age.

330
00:16:39,495 --> 00:16:41,915
Someone without
a porny internet name

331
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,358
and perhaps no criminal past.

332
00:16:43,371 --> 00:16:44,825
- A nice girl.
- A viable girl.

333
00:16:44,835 --> 00:16:46,535
Someone with whom you can
have a relationship.

334
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,939
You're a respected doctor.

335
00:16:47,949 --> 00:16:50,705
Go out in the real world,
meet a woman your own age

336
00:16:50,724 --> 00:16:53,701
- and ask her out.
- Be a man, Cooper.

337
00:16:54,523 --> 00:16:55,697
Be a man.

338
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:08,316
There you are.

339
00:17:09,003 --> 00:17:11,482
I just stopped by to see how
Lisa and the baby are doing.

340
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:17,870
- You okay?
- Yeah. I just... I...

341
00:17:19,476 --> 00:17:21,049
I had a little
too much surgery today.

342
00:17:21,058 --> 00:17:22,222
But I'm... I'm good.

343
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,839
- You look good.
- Yeah.

344
00:17:27,805 --> 00:17:29,974
You look... beautiful.

345
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,646
Sam told me that
I had to stay away from you

346
00:17:34,664 --> 00:17:36,759
- because you're Naomi's friend, but...
- Stop it.

347
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,199
- What?
- You're flirting.

348
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:40,488
- What's wrong with flirting?
- What's wrong with it?

349
00:17:40,553 --> 00:17:41,801
What's wrong?

350
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:44,993
What's wrong is
that I don't have time for it.

351
00:17:45,072 --> 00:17:47,886
I am... out of time.
I missed my chance.

352
00:17:47,896 --> 00:17:49,790
And now I have two eggs left.

353
00:17:50,293 --> 00:17:52,350
I might as well have no eggs left.

354
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,985
I am egg-less.

355
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,947
Naomi says that she's dried up?

356
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:59,167
I'm the one who's dried up.
I'm all barren and dried up.

357
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,680
And I have clearly
been wasting my time on men.

358
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:03,676
I mean,
I might as well take up hobbies,

359
00:18:03,967 --> 00:18:05,347
like needlepoint,

360
00:18:05,367 --> 00:18:08,400
or, um, collecting those little
ceramic dolls, you know?

361
00:18:08,407 --> 00:18:10,304
Because that's
what dried up women do.

362
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,569
They do needlepoint.

363
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:14,842
They do not waste their time
flirting with men

364
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,260
who clearly just want to get laid.

365
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,100
They do not waste their time...

366
00:18:20,597 --> 00:18:22,404
telling overly personal...

367
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,797
information about their eggs
to total strangers.

368
00:18:26,807 --> 00:18:28,121
Oh, my god. I'm sorry.

369
00:18:29,786 --> 00:18:31,167
What are you doing?

370
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:34,066
I'm gonna kiss you.

371
00:18:34,684 --> 00:18:36,073
I'm gonna kiss you with tongue.

372
00:18:37,672 --> 00:18:39,409
I'm gonna kiss you
so you feel it.

373
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:41,850
Okay?

374
00:18:44,153 --> 00:18:45,158
Okay.

375
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,453
Why'd you do that?

376
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:17,947
To remind you...

377
00:19:19,046 --> 00:19:20,323
that you're not dried up.

378
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:25,577
If you need me
to remind you again...

379
00:19:27,663 --> 00:19:28,705
let me know.

380
00:19:42,031 --> 00:19:43,415
When do the cramping start?

381
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,003
- A little while ago.
- What is it?

382
00:19:45,022 --> 00:19:46,628
- Is it...
- Probably nothing serious.

383
00:19:46,637 --> 00:19:48,561
It could just be a reaction
to the antibiotics.

384
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:49,954
We may have to switch
to another one,

385
00:19:49,963 --> 00:19:51,907
but it may mean
another night here.

386
00:19:52,876 --> 00:19:54,360
It's okay, it's okay.

387
00:19:55,011 --> 00:19:56,035
It's okay.

388
00:20:03,156 --> 00:20:04,329
Wait.

389
00:20:05,105 --> 00:20:07,171
I know...
I know that you think we're awful,

390
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:09,367
and I think that we're awful.

391
00:20:09,481 --> 00:20:10,682
I just, um...

392
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,175
I just wanted a baby so badly.

393
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,006
I just wanted a baby.

394
00:20:16,156 --> 00:20:18,090
And I don't care
who the father is,

395
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:19,564
I don't care if the baby's mine.

396
00:20:19,569 --> 00:20:23,052
All that matters is the baby.
Is... Is she gonna be okay?

397
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:26,134
Just tell me that
she's gonna be okay.

398
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:31,773
She's gonna be okay.

399
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,054
Thank you.

400
00:20:36,931 --> 00:20:38,133
You're welcome.

401
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,620
I hear Callie's going to be
a bridesmaid.

402
00:20:47,676 --> 00:20:48,699
Yeah.

403
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:54,292
Would you, um, say that
you were the one

404
00:20:54,499 --> 00:20:57,044
that needed more urging
to get married?

405
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:58,293
Oh, I hadn't...

406
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,781
Really been thinking about it.
I...

407
00:21:01,257 --> 00:21:03,915
It just, uh, seemed like
a good idea at the time.

408
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:08,223
You and Cristina have been
together for a while.

409
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:09,387
You got married pretty fast.

410
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,710
So in theory it's better
to know someone pretty well.

411
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:14,415
- Way better than...
- Still, no guarantees.

412
00:21:16,381 --> 00:21:17,611
I-I don't...

413
00:21:18,626 --> 00:21:20,767
- believe in divorce.
- Neither do I.

414
00:21:23,872 --> 00:21:24,980
Is it possible...

415
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:28,555
do you think,
to love two people...

416
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:32,279
at the same time?

417
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:34,525
I, uh...

418
00:21:36,133 --> 00:21:38,556
I'm still hoping it's possible
just to love one person.

419
00:21:42,771 --> 00:21:44,931
So, uh, it's not gonna be
too weird, right?

420
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:46,842
- Me as a bridesmaid?
- No, no, it's fine.

421
00:21:46,851 --> 00:21:48,705
- 'Cause I can tell Cristina...
- I said it's fine.

422
00:21:48,732 --> 00:21:49,962
Really, no worries.

423
00:21:50,356 --> 00:21:51,502
So, um...

424
00:21:52,023 --> 00:21:54,553
Did George tell you he's thinking
about transferring to Mercy West?

425
00:21:54,571 --> 00:21:56,732
Yeah. Sounds like a good idea.

426
00:21:58,587 --> 00:22:01,085
- So we're fine?
- Oh, we are. Fine.

427
00:22:04,155 --> 00:22:06,202
Hey, that last dress
was okay, wasn't it?

428
00:22:06,369 --> 00:22:09,355
I mean, it was too tight
and I couldn't breathe, but...

429
00:22:10,266 --> 00:22:12,092
- A wedding's just one day, right?
- Yeah.

430
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,619
We got Paul's M.R.I. back,

431
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,594
and I've consulted with
Dr. Straley at Sloan-Kettering.

432
00:22:24,605 --> 00:22:26,652
We found a tumor
on your adrenal gland.

433
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:28,615
All right? Is its right
on top of the kidney,

434
00:22:28,642 --> 00:22:30,774
and it's what's been causing
your low sex drive.

435
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,429
So it wasn't me?
He's got a condition.

436
00:22:35,324 --> 00:22:38,151
A tumor, that's not too...

437
00:22:38,897 --> 00:22:40,231
You can treat that, right?

438
00:22:41,924 --> 00:22:44,582
These tumors are usually
aggressive and found late

439
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:46,657
because the symptoms
are so subtle.

440
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,684
What does that mean?

441
00:22:48,866 --> 00:22:50,810
Treatment is difficult and risky,

442
00:22:51,382 --> 00:22:52,951
but there is hope.

443
00:22:54,276 --> 00:22:56,942
Oh, my god, honey,
I can't believe I yelled at you.

444
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:58,454
I'm so sorry.

445
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:00,711
It's all right, honey.
It's okay.

446
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,847
No, I'm horrible.
I'm so sorry.

447
00:23:02,899 --> 00:23:04,406
I love you so much.

448
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:25,316
Hello?

449
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:29,318
Hello?

450
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:33,857
Are you there...

451
00:23:34,651 --> 00:23:36,495
elevator god?

452
00:23:37,544 --> 00:23:38,980
It's me, Addison.

453
00:23:40,445 --> 00:23:41,525
<i>What?</i>

454
00:23:41,849 --> 00:23:42,910
Hi.

455
00:23:43,237 --> 00:23:44,251
<i>Hi.</i>

456
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:47,620
Okay, look, you may be
a figment of my imagination,

457
00:23:47,653 --> 00:23:49,794
or maybe I'm going
completely insane,

458
00:23:50,648 --> 00:23:52,395
I don't know. Or maybe...

459
00:23:52,846 --> 00:23:54,938
this is payback for my crimes

460
00:23:54,947 --> 00:23:57,149
on some ginormous karmic level,
I don't know.

461
00:23:57,175 --> 00:23:58,452
I just...

462
00:23:59,597 --> 00:24:03,297
I just want to tell you
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

463
00:24:06,422 --> 00:24:07,427
Okay?

464
00:24:08,984 --> 00:24:10,026
<i>Okay.</i>

465
00:24:14,742 --> 00:24:15,785
Well...

466
00:24:16,864 --> 00:24:17,972
bye.

467
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,566
I am such a screwup...

468
00:24:24,907 --> 00:24:25,912
in my life.

469
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,913
Up until now, I have been
really great at one thing.

470
00:24:30,856 --> 00:24:32,931
I am great...

471
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,010
at being Paul's wife.

472
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,250
And I thought
he didn't want me anymore.

473
00:24:37,265 --> 00:24:40,486
I thought... I was sure that he was
in love with somebody else.

474
00:24:40,671 --> 00:24:41,722
Of course you were.

475
00:24:42,985 --> 00:24:44,055
I lied to Paul.

476
00:24:47,035 --> 00:24:48,350
I was with a man

477
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:50,579
that night that I didn't come home.

478
00:24:53,438 --> 00:24:54,983
I didn't even find him
that attractive.

479
00:24:55,006 --> 00:24:56,020
I just told myself

480
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,413
that I wasn't gonna settle
for being alone, you know?

481
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:02,421
Kathy, you were reacting
to what was in front of you.

482
00:25:03,245 --> 00:25:06,024
There was no way you could
know what was really going on.

483
00:25:06,115 --> 00:25:08,039
What do I do now?

484
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,462
You do what you're great at.

485
00:25:19,846 --> 00:25:21,179
You love your husband.

486
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:30,310
You're gonna have to
tell me that a lot, okay?

487
00:25:31,793 --> 00:25:32,901
Okay.

488
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:39,819
Hey, everyone else is gone.
I was heading out.

489
00:25:41,045 --> 00:25:44,416
Uh, unless... I was gonna get
some food. You want something?

490
00:25:47,548 --> 00:25:49,116
I... I ate.

491
00:25:49,521 --> 00:25:50,535
Thanks for asking.

492
00:25:52,961 --> 00:25:54,003
Another night?

493
00:25:55,906 --> 00:25:57,812
- Are you...
- Asking you out on a date? Yes.

494
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,398
You can't ask me out.

495
00:25:59,408 --> 00:26:00,728
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

496
00:26:00,747 --> 00:26:01,916
I asked.

497
00:26:02,045 --> 00:26:04,205
You're... You're a fetus.

498
00:26:05,461 --> 00:26:06,850
You could be my fetus.

499
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:08,933
Coo coo cachoo, Mrs. Robinson.

500
00:26:08,948 --> 00:26:11,417
You can't use "The Graduate"
as a defense.

501
00:26:11,509 --> 00:26:14,265
You can't use a movie made
before you were born as a defense.

502
00:26:14,294 --> 00:26:15,308
Go out with me.

503
00:26:16,871 --> 00:26:18,768
I like you, and you like me.

504
00:26:24,611 --> 00:26:25,615
Dell.

505
00:26:29,078 --> 00:26:30,411
Never gonna happen.

506
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:47,779
I'm starting to think L.A.
is like New York, but with a beach.

507
00:26:48,035 --> 00:26:49,368
Why do you think we moved here?

508
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:52,772
Uh, Pete.

509
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:54,782
Uh, isn't it time for you
to get some refills?

510
00:26:55,177 --> 00:26:56,247
Thanks.

511
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,922
Okay, Pete is my friend,

512
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,950
don't get me wrong, but...

513
00:27:06,978 --> 00:27:08,398
Why are you warning me
about him?

514
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,774
What, is he like a serial killer?
Is he a felon?

515
00:27:10,904 --> 00:27:14,105
Is he secretly
my ex-husband's best friend?

516
00:27:14,667 --> 00:27:16,329
His wife died eight years ago.

517
00:27:18,146 --> 00:27:20,418
- Now I feel shallow.
- No, it's just...

518
00:27:20,811 --> 00:27:22,699
He can't connect with women.

519
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:23,957
He's a good man,

520
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:26,209
but if you want someone
who's gonna be there,

521
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,012
then Pete's not that guy.

522
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,208
- You ready?
- Yeah, good.

523
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,638
This is nice, huh?

524
00:27:44,262 --> 00:27:45,718
- It is.
- Yeah.

525
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,140
- Oh, no.
- What?

526
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:57,725
- That's not nice.
- Oh, you s...

527
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,797
Hold it, hold it, hold on.
You said, "Be a man."

528
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:02,783
Cooper, I commend you.
You're making an effort.

529
00:28:02,805 --> 00:28:05,481
But I'm... I'm...
But I'm your friend.

530
00:28:05,608 --> 00:28:07,824
You can't be a man
with your friend.

531
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:11,373
- Isn't that settling?
- Kinda, yeah.

532
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,184
Yes.

533
00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:17,372
- Okay.
- Settling.

534
00:28:17,398 --> 00:28:18,788
- Great.
- Thank you, yes.

535
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,774
- But we're good?
- We're very good.

536
00:28:24,002 --> 00:28:25,148
Hey, ex-best friend.

537
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:27,549
- Hey, ex-husband.
- You are drunk.

538
00:28:27,686 --> 00:28:30,287
Ten more minutes, and I start dancing,
and I require company.

539
00:28:35,911 --> 00:28:37,968
I don't think I've ever
seen her drunk before.

540
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:40,919
Sam...

541
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:46,171
Did you cheat on her?

542
00:28:46,735 --> 00:28:49,255
Over the years,
there have been temptations,

543
00:28:50,358 --> 00:28:53,102
but, no... I didn't.

544
00:28:53,513 --> 00:28:56,424
Was there a lot of fighting or...

545
00:28:57,199 --> 00:28:58,250
Hardly ever.

546
00:29:00,495 --> 00:29:01,696
Honestly...

547
00:29:03,554 --> 00:29:05,376
it was bad, what I did.

548
00:29:08,385 --> 00:29:09,728
I have no good reason.

549
00:29:11,898 --> 00:29:13,315
I woke up one day...

550
00:29:14,862 --> 00:29:16,721
and I couldn't do it anymore.

551
00:29:17,565 --> 00:29:19,011
It wasn't even a choice.

552
00:29:21,891 --> 00:29:23,008
I had a thought...

553
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:25,734
Next thing you know...

554
00:29:27,007 --> 00:29:28,294
I'm burning it all down.

555
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,006
I left her.

556
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,200
I don't know why.

557
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:37,631
I don't know why.

558
00:29:39,286 --> 00:29:40,761
What kind of a person does that?

559
00:29:41,104 --> 00:29:42,104
Hell if I know.

560
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,848
And I did it, too.

561
00:29:51,914 --> 00:29:53,257
So I ran into Allan...

562
00:29:53,566 --> 00:29:54,590
at Whole Foods.

563
00:29:54,716 --> 00:29:56,134
Wanna hear something funny?

564
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:00,460
He said he didn't believe in marriage,
that marriage wasn't for him.

565
00:30:00,853 --> 00:30:02,158
But I guess that was wrong,

566
00:30:02,364 --> 00:30:05,182
because it only took him
four months.

567
00:30:05,664 --> 00:30:08,452
Four months after we broke up,
he got married,

568
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:10,875
to someone who can't be
more than 25 years old.

569
00:30:12,027 --> 00:30:13,219
Isn't that funny?

570
00:30:29,492 --> 00:30:30,722
It heads off rejection.

571
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,490
What?

572
00:30:34,317 --> 00:30:35,847
That's why I like the Internet.

573
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:37,998
I can't stand the...

574
00:30:39,527 --> 00:30:41,404
It's horrible, being rejected.

575
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:44,238
It is.

576
00:30:56,361 --> 00:30:58,877
Preston, I thought you had
a late surgery.

577
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:05,763
You know all that...

578
00:31:06,608 --> 00:31:07,754
"I trust you" crap?

579
00:31:08,459 --> 00:31:10,647
You've been pulling that on me
since I was this high.

580
00:31:10,675 --> 00:31:12,036
Preston, language.

581
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,148
No.

582
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,796
"I trust you" is code for
"Learn from your mistakes."

583
00:31:18,989 --> 00:31:20,069
This is not a mistake.

584
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:21,693
I never said it was a mistake.

585
00:31:21,721 --> 00:31:24,655
Cristina never knows
what's good for her.

586
00:31:24,948 --> 00:31:26,573
- That's who she is.
- Preston...

587
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:28,676
She hates change.

588
00:31:28,695 --> 00:31:30,431
I lead. I have to.

589
00:31:31,061 --> 00:31:32,094
And then she's grateful.

590
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,639
That's how it was with dating,
with moving in.

591
00:31:34,952 --> 00:31:36,333
Then I'm pleased for you.

592
00:31:38,178 --> 00:31:40,534
Look, I am going to
make her happy, Mama.

593
00:31:40,886 --> 00:31:42,247
The wedding is a huge step,

594
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:44,233
and she's being a great sport.
You know why?

595
00:31:44,345 --> 00:31:46,674
Because she will be
happy someday.

596
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:50,228
If you are so sure...

597
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:53,309
why are you yelling at me?

598
00:32:01,674 --> 00:32:03,786
- What happened?
- She's septic.

599
00:32:03,824 --> 00:32:05,111
The sooner
we can get her to an O.R.,

600
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,613
the sooner we can help her.
Let's move.

601
00:32:06,623 --> 00:32:08,903
- Richard, what... happened?
- Extremely rare complication.

602
00:32:08,922 --> 00:32:10,825
Toxic megacolon with a perforation.

603
00:32:10,857 --> 00:32:12,216
Can you get your dad
out of this room?

604
00:32:12,239 --> 00:32:13,694
This fast? How could...

605
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,517
Sometimes it progresses this rapidly.

606
00:32:15,522 --> 00:32:17,728
Very rarely, but sometimes.
We booked an O.R.

607
00:32:17,772 --> 00:32:19,173
You're going into surgery
right now?

608
00:32:19,183 --> 00:32:20,909
I didn't sign a consent form.

609
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:22,721
She needs surgery right now,
Thatcher.

610
00:32:22,735 --> 00:32:25,029
Not tomorrow, not later today.
Right now.

611
00:32:25,048 --> 00:32:26,209
- Thatcher.
- Honey, listen...

612
00:32:26,228 --> 00:32:27,852
We need you to stay back, okay?

613
00:32:36,838 --> 00:32:38,349
You're gonna be okay.
This happens.

614
00:32:38,359 --> 00:32:39,607
You're gonna be okay.

615
00:32:40,308 --> 00:32:42,196
We're losing her pulse,
she's coding.

616
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:43,909
Okay, let's go.
Let's move. Move.

617
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:52,892
She's okay, huh?

618
00:32:53,573 --> 00:32:54,996
I mean,
after all she went through,

619
00:32:55,005 --> 00:32:56,780
she still looks pretty awesome.

620
00:32:57,747 --> 00:32:58,761
Lisa,

621
00:32:58,930 --> 00:33:01,005
we need to know what you want
to do with the baby.

622
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:03,400
Carol...
she wants this so bad.

623
00:33:03,687 --> 00:33:05,245
This is about what you want.

624
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:09,527
- We did find out the paternity.
- No, no. I don't wanna know.

625
00:33:12,588 --> 00:33:13,977
She's awesome, though.

626
00:33:16,009 --> 00:33:17,520
You don't have to decide right now.

627
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,122
No. I know what I want to do.

628
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,477
Lisa gave the baby to Carol.

629
00:33:26,634 --> 00:33:28,822
On the condition
they'd all be part of her life.

630
00:33:28,963 --> 00:33:31,470
So it turns out the baby
will have three dads anyway.

631
00:33:31,574 --> 00:33:32,785
And two moms.

632
00:33:32,965 --> 00:33:34,082
Lisa did a good thing.

633
00:33:34,439 --> 00:33:35,468
They look happy.

634
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:39,643
They look like a family.

635
00:34:08,626 --> 00:34:10,607
- Izzie, look...
- Look, I don't want you to go.

636
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,313
To Mercy West...
I don't want you...

637
00:34:14,207 --> 00:34:15,428
It's not fair.

638
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:19,354
I know we can't help
what happened,

639
00:34:19,373 --> 00:34:20,697
and I know that we didn't...

640
00:34:22,814 --> 00:34:24,664
I stood in that bridal shop
with your wife,

641
00:34:24,686 --> 00:34:26,639
and I smiled and I talked,
and I...

642
00:34:26,986 --> 00:34:28,160
felt like...

643
00:34:31,094 --> 00:34:32,211
That's not fair.

644
00:34:32,806 --> 00:34:34,342
I don't want you to go
to Mercy West

645
00:34:34,361 --> 00:34:37,337
because I'm losing my best friend,
and it's not fair.

646
00:34:40,048 --> 00:34:41,325
It's just not fair.

647
00:35:18,134 --> 00:35:19,233
We can't.

648
00:35:20,274 --> 00:35:21,372
I know.

649
00:35:24,857 --> 00:35:26,895
I was looking for you.
You ready to go?

650
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,427
A lot of folks would kill
for what you have, you know?

651
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:39,022
A clean slate.

652
00:35:40,726 --> 00:35:42,867
So you don't remember?
So what?

653
00:35:44,237 --> 00:35:45,514
You'll make new memories.

654
00:35:46,412 --> 00:35:47,820
Oh, wow. Look at that.

655
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:50,263
It's so beautiful.

656
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,357
How can you be so...

657
00:35:58,697 --> 00:36:00,881
You're so good with me.

658
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,768
What's wrong with you
that you can't be is good

659
00:36:03,777 --> 00:36:05,796
with someone
you have feelings for?

660
00:36:07,211 --> 00:36:09,577
What happened to you, Alex?

661
00:36:17,626 --> 00:36:20,241
Maybe I don't remember.
So what?

662
00:36:57,146 --> 00:37:00,423
We did everything...
we could.

663
00:37:13,794 --> 00:37:16,132
You... You said
it was really simple

664
00:37:16,194 --> 00:37:17,640
and that it was this...

665
00:37:18,453 --> 00:37:20,753
- small thing.
- It was.

666
00:37:21,511 --> 00:37:23,003
She had the hiccups.

667
00:37:26,055 --> 00:37:27,125
She came here...

668
00:37:27,951 --> 00:37:29,510
because...
because she trusted you.

669
00:37:31,612 --> 00:37:33,011
I trusted you.

670
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:37,969
- Meredith, just stop. Okay, just stop.
- No, don't. Don't.

671
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:41,563
<i>At some point, maybe we accept</i>

672
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,695
<i>that the dream
has become a nightmare.</i>

673
00:37:45,892 --> 00:37:48,258
She had the hiccups.
Oh, god.

674
00:37:50,392 --> 00:37:51,744
The hiccups.

675
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:04,924
They've left. It's just us.

676
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,525
Oh, thank god.

677
00:38:19,616 --> 00:38:20,912
I got a dress.

678
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,741
You happy?

679
00:38:28,022 --> 00:38:29,083
Yeah.

680
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,839
Are you... happy?

681
00:38:33,959 --> 00:38:34,975
Yeah.

682
00:38:39,709 --> 00:38:42,104
<i>We tell ourselves
the reality is better.</i>

683
00:38:47,679 --> 00:38:48,704
Limes!

684
00:38:48,965 --> 00:38:50,195
- Limes.
- Limes.

685
00:38:50,214 --> 00:38:52,126
So what are we
drinking to this time?

686
00:38:52,281 --> 00:38:54,891
Friends. Crappy friends.

687
00:38:55,348 --> 00:38:57,245
Family. Crappy family.

688
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:04,271
Again?

689
00:39:04,487 --> 00:39:05,491
- Again.
- Again.

690
00:39:07,841 --> 00:39:09,136
<i>Who wants another?</i>

691
00:39:21,999 --> 00:39:23,144
<i>We convince ourselves</i>

692
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:25,060
<i>it's better
that we never dream at all.</i>

693
00:39:27,276 --> 00:39:28,713
<i>But the strongest of us,</i>

694
00:39:28,943 --> 00:39:30,690
<i>the most determined of us,</i>

695
00:39:31,075 --> 00:39:32,511
<i>we hold on to the dream.</i>

696
00:39:33,257 --> 00:39:34,572
You're ugly and old.

697
00:39:35,111 --> 00:39:36,435
I'll miss you, too.

698
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:44,245
There is an empty office.

699
00:39:45,532 --> 00:39:46,602
Don't tempt me.

700
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:48,189
Think about it.

701
00:39:50,693 --> 00:39:54,665
<i>Or we find ourselves faced with
a fresh dream we never considered.</i>

702
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:58,705
Hold the door.

703
00:39:59,765 --> 00:40:01,709
<i>We awake to find ourselves...</i>

704
00:40:03,006 --> 00:40:04,481
<i>against all odds...</i>

705
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:07,735
<i>feeling hopeful.</i>

706
00:40:08,604 --> 00:40:09,947
This is gonna sound...

707
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:13,222
When no one else is around,

708
00:40:14,514 --> 00:40:16,054
the elevator kind of, uh....

709
00:40:17,049 --> 00:40:18,232
Talks to me.

710
00:40:20,827 --> 00:40:21,888
Hi, Tilly.

711
00:40:22,439 --> 00:40:23,744
<i>Hey, Pete.</i>

712
00:40:24,138 --> 00:40:25,143
That's Tilly.

713
00:40:25,471 --> 00:40:27,781
She works security.
The camera is right there.

714
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:36,752
Hello, Tilly.

715
00:40:36,837 --> 00:40:39,034
<i>Hey, I get my kicks
wherever I can.</i>

716
00:40:41,625 --> 00:40:43,332
- You goin' home?
- Yeah...

717
00:40:44,507 --> 00:40:45,534
Home.

718
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:47,375
You get what you came for?

719
00:40:48,702 --> 00:40:51,490
I honestly... don't know.

720
00:40:54,553 --> 00:40:56,018
Do you want me
to kiss you again?

721
00:40:58,525 --> 00:40:59,661
I think...

722
00:41:01,088 --> 00:41:02,187
not.

723
00:41:02,338 --> 00:41:04,103
Because of the evators
where you come from?

724
00:41:04,131 --> 00:41:06,507
Those horny,
aphrodisiac elevators?

725
00:41:08,247 --> 00:41:09,899
Yeah, that, and, um...

726
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:12,315
I'm not interested, so...

727
00:41:25,767 --> 00:41:27,035
You're interested.

728
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:32,800
<i>And if we're lucky,
we realize...</i>

729
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:36,514
<i>in the face of everything,
in the face of life...</i>

730
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,389
<i>The true dream...</i>

731
00:41:45,879 --> 00:41:48,490
<i>is being able to dream at all.</i>
