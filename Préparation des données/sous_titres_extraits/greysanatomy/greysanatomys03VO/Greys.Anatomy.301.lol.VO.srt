1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,900
15 MINUTES,15 HOURS...

2
00:00:04,010 --> 00:00:06,000
INSIDE THE O.R.,

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,690
THE BEST SURGEONS  MAKE TIME FLY.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,780
OUTSIDE THE O.R.,HOWEVER,

5
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:17,510
TIME TAKES PLEASURE IN KICKING OUR ASSES.

6
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:22,810
FOR EVEN THE STRONGEST OF US,IT SEEMS TO PLAY TRICKS--

7
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:27,470
SLOWING DOWN,HOVERING...

8
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:31,910
UNTIL IT FREEZES...

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,410
LEAVING US STUCK IN A MOMENT,

10
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:40,090
UNABLE TO MOVE  IN ONE DIRECTION OR THE OTHER.

11
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:43,510
IZZIE.IZZIE. COME ON.

12
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,820
OKAY,SHE'S BEEN IN THERE ALL NIGHT. WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,420
- YEAH.
- YEAH.YEAH.

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,420
WHY ARE YOU ALL LOOKING AT ME?

15
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,050
WELL,THIS IS FAMILIAR TERRITORY FOR YOU.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,980
THERE IS NOTHING FAMILIAR ABOUT THIS.

17
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,420
UNFAMILIAR.

18
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,580
DENNY DIED.

19
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:01,810
THE MAN SHE LOVES DIED.

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,020
YEAH,BUT YOU'RE ALL DARK AND TWISTY INSIDE.

21
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,360
"DARK AND TWISTY"?

22
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:06,760
THE MOTHER WITH THE ALZHEIMER'S THING

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:07,890
AND THE FATHER YOU DON'T TALK TO.

24
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,290
AND THE TEQUILA THING AND THE INAPPROPRIATE MEN THING.

25
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,190
YOU ARE DARK AND TWISTY INSIDE,MEREDITH,AND NOW IZZIE IS DARK AND TWISTY INSIDE.

26
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:15,860
SO ALL OF A SUDDEN I'M THE PRESIDENT OF PEOPLE WITH CRAPPY LIVES?

27
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,860
SERIOUSLY,WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

28
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,500
SOMEONE HAS TO GO IN THERE.

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,910
THE SEVEN YEARS  YOU SPEND AS A SURGICAL RESIDENT

30
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:31,750
WILL BE THE BEST  AND WORST OF YOUR LIFE.

31
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,160
LOOK AROUND YOU.

32
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:38,320
SAY HELLO  TO YOUR COMPETITION.

33
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,610
HI. IZZIE STEVENS.WASHINGTON.

34
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:44,820
HEY. ALEX KAREV.IA.

35
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,400
THIS IS NICE,RIGHT? THEY THREW A MIXER FOR THE NEW INTERNS.

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,880
YEAH.

37
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:52,360
IT'S JUST AN EXCUSE TO GET US ALL HAPPY AND DRUNK BEFORE THEY TORTURE US.

38
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,810
- WHAT PROGRAM ARE YOU IN?
- SURGERY.

39
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,660
- SERIOUSLY?
- SERIOUSLY.

40
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,290
WHAT?

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,270
I-I PICKED YOU FOR GYNIE OR PEDS OR SOMETHING.

42
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,680
YOU DON'T THINK I CAN BE A SURGEON?

43
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,140
I CAN BE A SURGEON.

44
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,040
SURGERY'S HARD-CORE.

45
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,920
I'M HARD-CORE.

46
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,090
YOU WON'T LAST THE FIRST YEAR,BABE.

47
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:16,710
HEY,IZZIE. WHAT?

48
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,040
MAYBE YOU SHOULD...

49
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,640
CH-CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.

50
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,890
MAYBE YOU'D WANT TO WEAR SOMETHING MORE COMFORTABLE.

51
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,290
- STOP IT.
- I KNOW.

52
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,800
- IZZIE--
- STOP IT.I MEAN IT.STOP...TALKING.

53
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,730
THERE IS NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT. DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,130
THERE IS NOTHING TO DISCUSS.

55
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:46,960
I'M SO SORRY.

56
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:52,640
YEAH.YEAH,ME,TOO.

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,410
- SO YOU'RE A SURGEON.
- YES.

58
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,440
USUALLY THEY DON'T SEND A SURGEON FOR THIS.

59
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:07,050
WHAT--WHAT DO WE NEED TO-- HOW DO I DO THIS?

60
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,220
HOW DO WE DO THIS?

61
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,860
YOU JUST GOTTA I.D.THE BODY BEFORE I TAKE HIM TO THE FUNERAL HOME...

62
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:13,210
SO I DON'T TAKE THE WRONG GUY.

63
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,020
THAT HAPPENS?

64
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,920
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW MANY TIMES I TAKE THE WRONG GUY.

65
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:30,680
TH-THAT'S HIM.THAT'S... DENNY DUQUETTE.

66
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,400
GREAT. LOAD HIM UP.AND SIGN.

67
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,790
WHEN'S THE FUNERAL?

68
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,740
NO FUNERAL.

69
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:41,980
THE FAMILY ASKED TO HAVE THE BODY SENT TO MEMPHIS.

70
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,910
UH,WAIT,WAIT,WAIT,WAIT.

71
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:55,800
I'M SORRY.

72
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,290
I'M SO SORRY.

73
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,580
WHY ARE WE MAKING SANDWICHES AGAIN?

74
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,740
IT'S WHAT YOU DO WHEN SOMEONE DIES. YOU COOK.

75
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,850
YEAH,I-I KNOW WHAT TO DO WHEN SOMEONE DIES.

76
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,220
I AM A JEW.

77
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,620
I KNOW FOOD AND DEATH.

78
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,140
IT'S SHIVAH.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,700
IS IT SHIVAH EVEN IF SHE'S CATHOLIC?

80
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,200
WELL,SHIVAH'S WHAT I KNOW HOW TO DO,SO...

81
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,980
YEAH,IT'S SHIVAH.

82
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,290
AND IF WE'RE SITTING SHIVAH FOR DENNY,

83
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,510
THEN WE SHOULD ORDER IN

84
00:04:26,570 --> 00:04:28,840
BECAUSE MAKING SANDWICHES IS NOT THE SAME AS COOKING.

85
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,580
SANDWICHES ARE COMFORT FOOD.

86
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,540
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

87
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,410
EVERYTHING WITH ME IS FINE.

88
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,710
IT'S IZZIE THATE'RE WORRIED ABOUT.

89
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,530
OH,WHAT DID YOU DO?

90
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,800
DENNY DIED. BURKE GOT SHOT.

91
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:48,170
LET'S JUST HAVE SOME PERSPECTIVE AND REMEMBER WHAT I DID IS A TINY,SLIGHTLY SMALL--

92
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:50,690
WHATEVER. SPIT IT OUT.

93
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,620
I LOST MY PANTIES LAST NIGHT.

I'VE BEEN HERE ALL NIGHT,TOO.

101
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,960
I WANTED TO SEE THE AUTOPSY ON DUQUETTE.

103
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,420

104
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:31,680
UH,DR.GREY-- HAVE YOU SEEN,UH,HAVE YOU SEEN DR.GREY?

105
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,040

00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:35,380
NO,COULD YOU JUST--

108
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,920
CAN YOU GET SOMEBODY TO COVER MY ROUNDS FOR ME SO I CAN TAKE CARE OF SOME STUFF?

00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,960
EJECTED FROM THE CAR.

114
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,740
SHE WAS--WE WERE COMING TO THE E.R.

115
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:55,860
WE WERE BOTH SICK.

116
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:57,420
WE COULDN'T SHAKE THIS FLU THING.

117
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:00,160
SO SHE WAS BETTER,SO I LET HER DRIVE.

118
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,200

00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,850
HE HAS TO BE ADMITTED.

- YOU CAN'T JUST TAKE HIM.

144
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,800
PAGE ADDISON SHEPHERD. TELL HER TO MEET ME IN THE NICU.

145
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,320
KAREV.

00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,180
DID YOU TRANSFUSE PLATELETS?

150
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,370

151
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,020
- WHERE'S THE MOTHER?
- I DON'T KNOW.

152
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,140
DR.KAREV...

153
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,570
I'M NOT ASKING YOU WHERE THE MOTHER IS FOR MY HEALTH.

154
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:24,990
I EXPECT YOU TO USE YOUR BRAIN.

155
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,470
- WHERE IS THE MOTHER?
- I DON'T KNOW!

156
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,400
THE BABY WAS FOUND IN A TRASH CAN AT A HIGH SCHOOL.

157
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,370
THEY LEFT HIM IN A TRASH CAN.

158
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,330
HE'S GOT SOME INNER ABDOMINAL BLEEDING ON C.T.

159
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,820
YOU WANT TO RUN SOME MORE TESTS?

160
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,710
DR.SHEPHERD?

00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:43,130
I NEED A STAT ULTRASOUND AND FOR YOU TO INFUSE 2 GRAMS OF I.V.I.G.

162
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,270
IF THERE IS NO CRANIAL BLEEDING.

163
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,890
AND THEN FIND OUT WHERE THE MOTHER IS.

164
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,080
I NEED TO TEST FOR MATERNAL PLATELET ANTIBODIES.

165
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,190
CAN'T YOU JUST DO SURGERY TO FIX THE ABDOMINAL BLEEDING?

166
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,670
IF I WANTED TO KILL HIM,I COULD DO THAT. DAMN IT.

167
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,210
WHO DOES THIS?

168
00:07:56,310 --> 00:08:01,210
DR.MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD,THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE HERE ABOUT THE BABY.

00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,910

00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,800
HOW'S IZZIE?

172
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,460
AS WELL AS CAN BE EXPECTED.

173
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,780
IT'S NEVER GETS EASIER,YOU KNOW? LOSING A PATIENT.

174
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,230
IT GETS A LITTLE LESS...

175
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,250
SHOCKING,I GUESS,BUT...

176
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:23,110
IT NEVER GETS ANY EASIER.

177
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:26,420
IZZIE WAS IN LOVE WITH HIM.

178
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:29,580
DENNY WASN'T JUST A PATIENT. THEY WERE IN LOVE.

179
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:37,310
YOU HAD SEX WITH DEREK IN AN EXAM ROOM AT THE PROM?

180
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,290
- YES.
- LAST NIGHT,YOU AND SHEPHERD DID IT?

181
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:41,610
YES.

182
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:44,530
YOU AND McDREAMY DID THE NASTY-NASTY?

183
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,970
- CRISTINA!
- I'M NOT JUDGING.

184
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,950
I'M JUST TRYING TO WRAP MY MIND AROUND IT.

185
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,130
I MEAN,YOU'RE WITH FINN,AND HE'S WITH ADDISON.

186
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:52,130
HE'S MARRIED TO ADDISON.

187
00:08:52,190 --> 00:08:53,450
YEAH.

188
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,660
WELL,WHAT DID DEREK SAY?

189
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:58,530
HE SAID,"MEREDITH,WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?"

190
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,020
OKAY... HE HAS SEX WITH YOU

191
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,440
AND HE'S STANDING THERE ALL McGUILTY,

192
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,040
AND ALL HE HAS TO SAY FOR HIMSELF IS,

193
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,740
"OH,WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?"

194
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,120
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

195
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,520
I DON'T KNOW.

196
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,890
WELL,ARE YOU GONNA GO BACK TO FINN?

197
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,940
UH,I-IS SHEPHERD LEAVING HIS WIFE?

198
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,670
- I JUST--
- MEREDITH,HOLD ON WITH BOTH HANDS.

199
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:23,190
- MEREDITH!
- MOMMY!

200
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,620
- RICHARD,YOU WERE TO TELL ADELE.
- LOOK,I-I CAN'T.

201
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:25,650
- I WAS TO TELL THATCHER.

202
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,430
- THAT IS WHAT WE SAID.
- I CAN'T DO IT.

203
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:27,930
THAT IS WHAT WE AGREED.

204
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,750
PLEASE,RICHARD,PLEASE.

205
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,400
YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME.

206
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,100
ELLIS,NO.

207
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,810
RICHARD,YOU CAN'T LEAVE ME!

208
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:46,120
RICHARD!RICHARD!RICHARD!

209
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,620
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE ME.

210
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,450
I'M YOUR HUSBAND.

211
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,600
AN APPOINTMENT SEEMED TO BE THE BEST WAY TO GET YOUR UNDIVIDED ATTENTION,BECAUSE HERE YOU ARE.

212
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,880
- ADELE,LISTEN--
- SIT DOWN.

213
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,500
- ADELE--
- SIT DOWN!

214
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,210
WE HAVE AN APPOINTMENT.

215
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,360
UH,CHIEF,EX-- UM,THE I.D.C.IS HERE.

216
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,000
WE HAD A COUPLE COME IN THIS MORNING--

217
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,960
DEREK JUST FINISHED A CRANIOTOMY ON THE WIFE--BUT THE HUSBAND,

218
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,860
HE'S GOT SEVERE FLU SYTOMS-- SWOLLEN LYMPH NODS,BUBOES.

219
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,140
- TURNS OUT THEY CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE PLAGUE.
- THE PLAGUE?

220
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:15,600
LOOK,I'M SORRY,ADELE.

221
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,030
I-I NEED TO DEAL WITH THIS.

222
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,520
SHANNON IS A STRAIGHT-A STUDENT.

223
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:22,640
SO WHAT,MY DAUGHTER GETS A B IN MATH,

224
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,540
AND SUDDENLY SHE'S BIRTHING BABIES IN TOILET STALLS?

225
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:27,060
I'M DR.MONTGOMERY-SHEPHERD. I'M TREATING THE NEWBORN.

226
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,930
HE HAS AN EMERGENT BLOOD CONDITION.

227
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,440
I NEED TO KNOW WHOSE BABY IT IS I'M DEALING WITH.

228
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:33,520
YEAH,WE'D ALL LIKE TO KNOW THAT.

229
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,910
SARA... TALK.

230
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,920
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANY BABY,MOM.

231
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,940
NONE OF US DO.

232
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,480
WELL,ONE OF YOU MUST KNOW SOMETHING,OTHERWISE YOU AND YOUR PARENTS WOULDN'T BE HERE.

233
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,880
OUR GIRLS--THE PRINCIPAL SAID THAT THEY WERE THE LAST PEOPLE IN THE BATHROOM BEFORE THAT BABY WAS FOUND.

234
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,860
SO WE JUST THOUGHT,BEFORE THE POLICE SHOW UP...

235
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:52,790
ONE OF YOU KNOWS,AND YOU BETTER CONFESS.

236
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,430
I DON'T WANT MY LISA MESSED UP IN THIS.

237
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:55,600
LOOK,THE POLICE WILL BE HERE SOON.

238
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:59,140
CAN'T YOU JUST DO SOME SORT OF D.N.A.TEST SO THAT THE REST OF US CAN GET OUT OF HERE?

239
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:00,730
D.N.A.RESULTS TAKE DAYS,

240
00:11:00,770 --> 00:11:04,100
AND FRANKLY,I'M NOT CONCERNED WITH GETTING THE REST OF YOU "OUT OF HERE."

241
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:06,370
IF THIS BABY ISN'T TREATED,HE'S GOING TO DIE.

242
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,590
NOW I CAN DO VAGINAL EXAMS ON EACH OF THE GIRLS--

243
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:11,120
MY DAUGHTER IS 14 YEARS OLD.

244
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,310
SHE'S NOT SEXUALLY ACTIVE.

245
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:14,050
AND I WON'T HAVE YOU VIOLATING HER BODY.

246
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,200
YOU WON'T HAVE IT 'CAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S YOUR KID.

247
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,470
I TELL YOU WHAT,YOU HAVE MY CONSENT

248
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,780
TO DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO PROVE MY LISA'S INNOCENT.

249
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,770
YOU ARE A SICK BASTARD,YOU KNOW THAT?

250
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:25,160
A CHILD'S LIFE IS IN JEOPARDY HERE.

251
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,860
AND IT'S NOT YOUR CONSENT THAT I NEED.

252
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,630
WE DIDN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG.

253
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,750
JUST BECAUSE WE WERE IN THERE DOESN'T MEAN IT'S OUR BABY.

254
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:41,860
DO WE LOOK LIKE THE KIND OF GIRLS WHO GET PREGNANT AND THROW THEIR KIDS INTO THE TRASH?

255
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,550
NICE WORK TODAY,O'MALLEY.

256
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:47,180
HEY,DID MEREDITH GO HOME WITH IZZIE?

257
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,490
YEAH,CRISTINA,TOO. I'M HEADED THERE NOW.

258
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,290
- YEAH,ME,TOO.
- OH,GREAT.

259
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,250
IT'S JUST THAT,UM...

260
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,610
I DON'T KNOW IF IZZIE'S UP FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE.

261
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,430
WELL,I'M GONNA GO SEE MEREDITH.

262
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,740
OH.OKAY.

263
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,480

264
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,680
- DR.O'MALLEY?
- YEAH.

265
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,780
I'M WITH THE I.D.C. IS ANYONE ELSE IN THIS ROOM?

266
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,600
NO.

267
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:06,500
- YOU PEORMED THE SURGERY ON MRS.TOUSSAINT?
- YES.

268
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,730
SHE AND HER HUSBAND WERE IN CLOSEONTACT WITH A VICTIM OF THE PLAGUE.

269
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,070
SHE MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED.

270
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,010
- WHICH MEANS WE MAY HAVE BEEN.
- YEAH.

271
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,380
I GOTTA GO. I CAN'T DO THIS.

272
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,890
WE'RE WAITING ON THE DIAGNOSIS ON MRS.TOUSSAINT.

273
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:19,580
THIS ROOM WILL BE SEALED OFF UNTIL WE KNOW THE THREAT HAS BEEN CONTAINED,AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY SAFE.

274
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,900
- YOU'RE NOT SAYING--
- YOU CANNOT LEAVE.

275
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,520
YOU TWO ARE QUARANTINED.

276
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:29,080
I SHOULD CHECK IN WITH THE I.D.C.REP. YOU KNOW,I HAVE TO STAY ON TOP OF MY HOSPITAL.

277
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,270
KEEP ME POSTED.

278
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,730
HELLO!HELLO! I NEED HELP.SOMEBODY,PLEASE.

279
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,390
I KNOW YOU CAN HEAR ME.

280

I SEE YOU STANDING OUT THERE IN YOUR GIANT WHITE SPACE SUIT.

281
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,890

282
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,300

286
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:55,120
AND I WILL NOT IGNORE A PATIENT.

287
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,290
AH. HELLO OUT THERE.

00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,070
THANK GOD. THANK GOD YOU CAN HEAR ME.

289
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,140
HOW IS MY WIFE?

290
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,540
MY NAME IS DR.BAILEY-- MIRANDA BAILEY.

291
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,820
YOUR WIFE IS OUT OF SURGERY.

292
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,010
SHE'S QUARANTINED IN RECOVERY,

293
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,180
BUT SHE'S DOING FINE.

294
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,780
NOW YOU WERE ASKING FOR HELP?

295
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:10,390
YOU KNOW HOW MANY DAYS I BEEN IN HERE?

296
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,780
IT'S ONLY BEEN A FEW HOURS.

297
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:13,530
REALLY?

298
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,140
I'M LOSING IT.

299
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,570
I'M LOSING TRACK OF TIME.

300
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,210
OKAY,SIR,YOU'RE SWEATING.

301
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,080

00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,870
GET BACK IN THE BED.

303
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:25,310
WH-WHAT ABOUT MY WIFE GISELLE?

304
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,830
CAN YOU FIND OUT ABOUT GISELLE?

305
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,300

306
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,540
BUT I CAN CHECK ON HER STATUS AGAIN.

307

00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,360
I BROUGHT FOOD.

317
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,910
UH,GEORGE ISN'T HERE.

318
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,360
NO,I-I KNOW.

00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,340
UH,HE'S IN A QUARANTINE 'CAUSE OF A-A THING.

320
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,690
AND I WAS OFF DUTY AND I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HIM

321
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,500
AND GOING CRAZY,AND I THOUGHT ABOUT IZZIE,AND SO I BROUGHT FOOD.

322
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,880

323
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,190

RELAX,I'M NOT GONNA BRING IT UP--

326
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:26,490
YOU AND McDREAMY AND THE SEX.

327
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,050
- I'M NOT THAT PERSON.
- GOOD.

328
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:31,360
- OKAY.
- GOOD.

329
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,600
SHIVAH? IS IT SHIVAH IF IZZIE'S CATHOLIC?

330
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,080
THIS THING THAT YOU'RE DOING,IZZIE,IT'S NOT HEALTHY.

331
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,540
I MEAN,YOU GOTTA TAKE OFF THAT DRESS.

332
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,420
TELL ME ABOUT SHIVAH.

333
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,880
WELL,IT'S SOMETHING YOU DO WHEN SOMEONE DIES.

334
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,140
YOU KNOW,WE DID IT FOR MY GRANDMOTHER.

335
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,920
HOW DOES IT WORK?

336
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,320
PEOPLE BRING OVER FOOD,

337
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:56,230
FAMILY COMES OVER.

338
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,060
IT'S SUPPOSED TO HELP WITH THE GRIEVING,YOU KNOW?

339
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,490
IT HONORS THE DEAD.

340
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,860
- SOUNDS NICE.
- YEAH.

341
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,530
SEVEN DAYS OF NO LEATHER SHOES,

342
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,230
NO--NO WORK,NO SEX,

343
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,210
NO SITTING ON THINGS HIGHER THAN A FOOT,

344
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,000
NO--NO SHAVING,NO...

345
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,940
WHAT?

346
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:21,990
NO CLEAN CLOTHES.

347
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,840
IZZIE...

348
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,650
THIS DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SHIVAH.

349
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,960
YOU KNOW THEY TOOK HIS BODY AWAY.

350
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,610
I WILL NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN.

351
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:40,860
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF YOU NEVER SAW BURKE AGAIN?

352
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,930
SO WE'RE SITTING SHIVAH FOR DENNY.

353
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,620
YOU WANT TO SEE HIM?

354
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,360
- SEE WHO?
- THE BABY.YOUR BABY.

355
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,540
IT'S NOT OUR BABY.

356
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,760
I'M GIVING YOU PERMISSION TO DO THIS THING. NOW WHAT'S THE HANG-UP?

357
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,290
THE "HANG-UP," SIR,

358
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,470
IS THAT IF YOUR DAUGHTER DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT,

359
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,010
I CAN'T FORCE HER.

360
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,130
THEY'RE 14. THEY'RE MINORS.

361
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,390
WE STILL HAVE A SAY.

362
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:17,510
NO,YOU DON'T.

363
00:16:17,550 --> 00:16:19,650
IF SOMEONE DOESN'T WANT TO SUBMIT TO A VAGINAL EXAM,

364
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,230
THEY DON'T HAVE TO. IT'S THE LAW.

365
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,480
ALL RIGHT. THAT'S IT.

366
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,410
I'M TAKING LISA HOME.

367
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:29,220
YOU DO THAT,SIR,AND I WILL HAVE YOU ARRESTED BEFORE YOU HIT THE PARKING LOT.

368
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,420
THE LAW ISN'T THE ONLY THING IN PLAY HERE.

369
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,800
IF I DO A VAGINAL EXAM AND THE GIRL IS A VIRGIN,

370
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:37,150
THERE COULD BE BLEEDING,UNDUE TRAUMA,

371
00:16:37,210 --> 00:16:38,530
NOT TO MENTION EMOTIONAL STRESS.

372
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,130
WELL,IF I HAD TO TAKE A GUESS AS TO WHOSE KID WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT--

373
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,560
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

374
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:44,570
IT'D JUST BE NICE IF KAREN HAD A CURFEW.

375
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,350
WELL,AT LEAST SHE'S NOT A SHOPLIFTER.

376
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:48,840
OH,SHANNON STOLE ONE LIPSTICK WHEN SHE WAS 9. GET OVER IT.

377
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,240
I KNOW FOR A FACT THAT MY LISA IS A VIRGIN.

378
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:52,110
REALLY?

379
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:52,880
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

380
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,660
BECAUSE SHE'S ONLY 14 YEARS OLD!

381
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,810
THEY'RE ALL 14.

382
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:58,830
DEREK. DEREK LISTEN TO ME.

383
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,970
DEREK,YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

384
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:01,680
DEREK,WE HAVE TO--

385
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,020
- WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS.
- NO,WE DON'T.

386
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,500
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN.

387
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:05,480
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

388
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,720
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH MY CLOTHES,DEREK?!

389
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,570
WAS ONE TIME! I KNOW THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE SAY.

390
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,000
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT ALWAYS GETS SAID,BUT IT'S--

391
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,540
I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED.

392
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,520
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING.

393
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:13,680
HE WAS JUST--HE WAS JUST HERE.

394
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:13,750
HE WAS JUST HERE.

395
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,590
YOU SCREW MY BEST FRIEND,AND ALL YOU CAN SAY--

396
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,980
"HE WAS JUST HERE"?

397
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:18,770
- GET OUT.
- NO.

398
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,240
GET OUT. NO.

399
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,360
NO,I'M NOT GOING.

400
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,420
WE'RE GONNA JUST TALK ABOUT THIS.

401
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,990
- WE'RE GONNA DISCUSS THIS.
- GET OUT OF MY HOUSE NOW!

402
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,620
NO.NO. I'M HOLDING MY GROUND.

403
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,630
- LET'S GO!
- I AM HOLDING MY GROUND.

404
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,280
WE DON'T QUIT!

405
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:29,660
WE HAVE TO WORK-- GET OUT.

406
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,940
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

407
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:32,520
DEREK! NO!

408
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:41,430

I CAN'T LOOK AT YOU.

421
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,480
I LOOK AT YOU,AND I FEEL NAUSEOUS.

422
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,100
I JUST...

423
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:42,960
WE'RE NOT DEREK AND ADDISON ANYMORE.

424
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,180
IF YOU GO NOW...

425
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,720
IF YOU GO NOW...

426
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,860
WE ARE NOT GONNA GET THROUGH THIS.

427
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,870
IF YOU GO NOW...

428
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,500
WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE.

429
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,020
WE DON'T HAVE A CHANCE...

430
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,980
IF YOU GO NOW.

431
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,900
IF YOU GO...

432
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,510

00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,040
AND I LIVE IN HER HOUSE.

448
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,170
WOW,THAT'S GREAT 'CAUSE HOUSING IS A NIGHTMARE.

449
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:03,670
I'M LIVING WITH MY,UH,PARENTS AT HOME,

450
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:06,580
WHICH,UH,WELL,SUCKS.

451
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,750
OH,IT'S NICE MEETING YOU.

452
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,950
WE'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE PLAGUE.

453
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,250
THEY DON'T KNOW IT'S THE PLAGUE.

454
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,930
SO THE MEN IN,UH,WHITE SUITS,JUST,WHAT,MAKING A FASHION STATEMENT?

455
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:20,100
NO,IT'S A PRECAUTION.

456
00:20:20,210 --> 00:20:22,130
WHEN THE BLOOD WORK COMES BACK,WE'LL BE OUTTA HERE.

457
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,710
WHAT IF THE RESULTS COME BACKAND SHE'S,UH,SHE HAS THE PLAGUE?

458
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,610
WELL,THEN WE GET THE PLAGUEAND THEN WE DIE IN HERE WITH THE CRAPPY BENCHES

459
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,330
AND THE DIRTY SCRUBSAND THE LOCKERS FULL OF OLD FOOD.

460
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,880
THERE'S FOOD IN THE LOCKERS?

461
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,230
DR.SHEPHERD,THOSE ARE PEOPLE'S PERSON--THAT'S ALEX'S APPLE.

462
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:42,430
THAT'S JUST RUDE.

463
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,790
SAFE HAVEN LAWS--ALL THOSE GIRLS WOULD'VE HAD TO DO IS

464
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,910
DROP THAT BABY OFF AT A FIRE STATIONOR A HOSPITAL.

465
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,460
NOW...

466
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,690
IT'S A MESS.

467
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,600
WHAT ARE OUR OPTIONS HERE?

468
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,200
BLOOD TYPING.

469
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,230
WE TAKE A SAMPLE FROM EACH OF THE GIRLS.

470
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,200
THE BABY'S BLOOD TYPE IS DOUBLE-O.

471
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:03,680
IF THE GIRLS ARE A OR B,IT MEANS THE BABY IS NOT THEIRS.

472
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,750
DO IT.

473
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,580
EVERYONE THINKS I'LL KNOW WHAT TSAY TO HER.

474
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:16,040
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

475
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,800
DARK AND TWISTY MEREDITH.

476
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,360
I'M NOT DARK AND TWISTY.

477
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,380
AND IF I AM DARK AND TWISTY,IT'S BECAUSE I LIVE MY LIFE UNDER A BANNER OF AVOIDANCE.

478
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,970
I AVOID. I'M AN AVOIDER.

479
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:29,470
HELLO?

480
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,900

I GOTTA GO CHECK ON IZZIE.

483
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,610
DON'T TAKE IT PERSONALLY.

484
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:45,280
IT'S THE DOCTOR THING.

485
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,860
WHAT?

486
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:51,090
FOUR YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL,FOUR YEARS OF COLLEGE,FOUR YEARS OF MED SCHOOL--

487
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:53,070
BY THE TIME WE GRADUATE,WE'RE IN OUR LATE 20s,

488
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,740
AND WE'VE NEVER DONE ANYTHING EXCEPT GO TO SCHOOLAND THINK ABOUT SCIENCE.

489
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,580
TIME STOPS.

490
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,860
WE'RE SOCIALLY RETARDED.

491
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,600
I MEAN,LOOK AT ME.

492
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,540
I'M IN LOVE WITH A GUY WHO WON'T SAY HE LOVES ME BACK,

493
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,940
AND HERE I AM IN HIS KITCHEN COOKING,JUST HOPING HE COMES HOME AND NOTICES ME.

494
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:11,010
I'M A TOTAL FREAK.

495
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:14,630
I'M THAT GIRL IN THE BACK OF THE CLASSWHO EATS HER HAIR.

496
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:17,200
MEREDITH...

497
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,360
SHE'S 17 YEARS OLD.

498
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,960
WE'RE ALL 17 YEARS OLD.

499
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,520
THIS IS HIGH SCHOOL WITH SCALPELS,FINN.

500
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,260
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY TO YOU.

501
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,350
WHEN DYLAN DIED...

502
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:40,100
WHEN--WHEN THE BOMB WENT OFF,DID YOU FEEL LIKE...

503
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,640
WHAT?

504
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:45,960
LIKE YOU WERE MOVING IN SLOW MOTION.

505
00:22:46,890 --> 00:22:51,880
HE WAS THERE AND THEN HE WASN'T,LIKE I BLINKED,AND HE WAS GONE.

506
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,450
I FEEL LIKE I'M MOVING IN SLOW MOTION...

507
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,170
LIKE I'M MOVING IN SLOW MOTIONAND EVERYTHING AROUND ME IS...

508
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,700
MOVING SO FAST. AND I JUST WANT TO GO BACK...

509
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:11,720
TO WHEN THINGS WERE NORMAL,WHEN I WASN'T "POOR IZZIE

510
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,740
LAYING ON THE BATHROOM FLOORIN HER PROM DRESS WITH HER..."

511
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,450

519
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:43,870

521
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:51,410
BUT I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THIS.

522
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,390
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO BE THIS PERSON. I DON'T...

523
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,360
I DON'T KNOW WHO THIS PERSON IS.

524
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:01,030
IZZIE...

525
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,550

526
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:09,070
HOW DID WE END UP HERE?

527
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:11,610
WHY AM I ALONE?

TRAIL MIX AND WARM SODA--WHO PUTS WARM SODA IN THEIR LOCKER?

531
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:31,380
AS USUAL,CRISTINA'S TOO LAZYTO STOCK HER LOCKER WITH FOOD.

532
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,120

I'M JUST A GIRL IN A BAR.

575
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,700
I'M JUST A GUY IN A BAR.

EVERYTHING'S NOT FINE.

OH,IT'S THE BLOOD RESULTS.

589
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,200

NO.

689
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,500
I DID.

690
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:37,090
BUT...

691
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,250
I...

692
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,060
I'M WITH CALLIE...

693
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,080
AND...

694
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:46,430
IT'S DIFFERENT,BUT...

695
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:49,500
YOU SHOULD TELL HER.

696
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:56,340
EVEN IF IT'S SOONISH,YOU SHOULD TELL HER BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

697
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,880
YOU MEAN BEFORE I DIE OF THE PLAGUE?

698
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:02,730
BEFORE SOMEBODY ELSE COMES ALONG.

699
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,560
THAT I BELIEVE.

700
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,180
OH,UH...

701
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,350
I'M GONNA...

702
00:33:10,430 --> 00:33:14,890
I'M GONNA LEAVE THE ROOM FOR A PERIOD OF TIMEFOR NO REASON WHATSOEVER.

703
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:20,050
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT...

704
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,470
BETWEEN YOU AND DEREK.

705
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,860
FINN--AND I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

706
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:27,230
ALL RIGHT,WE NEVER SAID THAT WE WERE EXCLUSIVE.

707
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,590
BUT YOU HAVE PLANS.

708
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:31,680
YEAH.

709
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:34,260
WELL,I DIDN'T SAY I WASN'T PISSED OFF.

710
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,680
I SAID WE WEREN'T EXCLUSIVE.

711
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:38,740
THAT'S ALL I WANTED TO SAY.

712
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:47,310
OH,AND,UH,AND THIS--I-I KNOW YOU THINK YOU'RE SCARY AND DAMAGED.

713
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,310
DARK AND TWISTY.

714
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,040
IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T DESERVE GOOD THINGS.

715
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,950
BUT YOU DO.

716
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,830
AND DEREK...

717
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:57,650
HE'S BAD FOR YOU.

718
00:33:57,680 --> 00:34:00,190
BUT ME-- I'M A GOOD THING.

719
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:06,080
AND IF THERE'S A RACE,IF THERE IS A-A RING,MY HAT IS IN.

720
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,270
I MADE AN APPOINTMENT FOR A REASON.

721
00:34:15,330 --> 00:34:18,120
I SCHEDULED THE TIMEBECAUSE I HAD SOMETHING IMPORTANT TO SAY,

722
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:20,630
AND YOU MADE ME WAIT.

723
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,060
I HAVE A SITUATION,ADELE.

724
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,430
- YOU DON'T¡ª
- I'VE SPENT MY LIFE WAITING,

725
00:34:24,470 --> 00:34:25,990
WAITING FOR YOU TO FINISH MED SCHOOL,

726
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:29,780
WAITING FOR YOU TO COME HOME AT NIGHT,WAITING FOR YOU TO LEAVE THAT...

727
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:30,590
WOMAN.

728
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,260
- I'M DONE WAITING. 
- ADELE--

729
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,880
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO MAKE A CHOICE--ME OR THIS HOSPITAL.

730
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:40,180
IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO RETIRE,RICHARD.

731
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,680
THERE HE IS.

732
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:50,220
THAT'S YOUR SON.

733
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,720
I WANT YOU BOTH TO LOOK AT HIM...

734
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,850
BECAUSE IT'S NOT TRUE THAT YOU DID NOTHING WRONG.

735
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,350
YOU BOTH ARE WRONG.

736
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,160
YOU'RE WRONG FOR COVERING THIS UP.

737
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,630
YOU'RE WRONG FOR LYING ABOUT IT.

738
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:02,870
YOU'RE WRONG FOR LETTING THIS LITTLE BABY,THIS

739
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:08,590
SWEET,INNOCENT,BEAUTIFUL LITTLE BOYSUFFER LIKE THIS.

740
00:35:08,670 --> 00:35:12,040
HE'S DYING,AND IT'S YOUR FAULT.

741
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,700
IT'S BOTH OF YOUR FAULT.

742
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:17,760
AND THE THING IS,THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT.

743
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,180
IN TIME,IT WILL COME OUT.

744
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:21,140
IT ALWAYS DOES.

745
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,710
IT JUST...

746
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,950
IT JUST DOES.

747
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:33,830
AND WHEN IT DOES,THIS BABY WILL BE DEAD.

748
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:42,640
SHANNON...

749
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:48,050
DON'T TELL MY MOM,OKAY?

750
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:54,240
THANK YOU.

751
00:35:57,250 --> 00:36:00,430
THANK YOU FOR TELLING THE TRUTH.

752
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:09,030
YOU--YOU REALLY DON'T FEEL ANYTHING?

753
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:13,310
I ONLY FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

754
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,620
I FEEL LIKE I MIGHT BE TOO LATE.

755
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,980
TOO LATE FOR WHAT?

756
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:19,540
THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND COOPERATION,DOCTORS.

757
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:23,800
YOU'LL HAVE TO GO ON A COURSE OF ANTIBIOTICS,BUT THE THREAT HAS BEEN CONTAINED.

758
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,520
GOOD.

759
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,430
WHAT?

760
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:29,780
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

761
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,500
POOR LITTLE GUY.

762
00:36:34,590 --> 00:36:38,910
THE MITE HE'S OKAY,WE HAVE TO TURN HIM OVERTO A MOTHER WHO'S GOIN' TO JUVIEAND

763
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:44,250
GRANDPARENTS WHO ARE SO CLUELESS,THEY DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE THEIR OWN KID WAS PREGNANT.

764
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:47,490
IMAGINE THE KIND OF CHILDHOOD HE'S GONNA HAVE.

765
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,120
YOU CAN GET OVER A BAD CHILDHOOD.

766
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:54,550
YOU CAN HAVE THE WORST CRAP IN THE WORLD HAPPEN TO YOU,

767
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,040
AND THEN YOU CAN GET OVER IT.

768
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,450
ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS SURVIVE.

769
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,860
HELLO?

770
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,630

00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,660

772
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,050
BUT I'M--I'M FINE.

773
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:14,250

774
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,360

00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:19,680

00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:12,670
SO... WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?

780
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,260
IT MEANS YOU HAVE A CHOICE.

781
00:38:16,370 --> 00:38:18,970
YOU HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE.

782
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,280
AND I DON'T WANT TO RUSH YOUINTO MAKING A DECISION BEFORE YOU'RE READY.

783
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:28,580
THIS MORNING,I WAS GONNA COME OVERAND I WAS GONNA SAY--

784
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:31,230

785
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:35,960

786
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:41,240

I'M A LITTLE LATE.

790
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,640
I KNOW I'M A LITTLE LATE IN TELLING YOU THAT.

791
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,080
I-I JUST...

792
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,710
I JUST WANT YOU TO TAKE YOUR TIME...

793
00:38:58,710 --> 00:39:01,230
YOU KNOW?

794
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,720
TAKE ALL THE TIME YOU NEED.

795
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,230
BECAUSE YOU HAVE...

796
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,430
A CHOICE TO MAKE.

797
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,890
AND WHEN I HAD A CHOICE TO MAKE...

798
00:39:12,970 --> 00:39:15,600
I CHOSE WRONG.

799
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:25,500
ALL RIGHT. GOOD NIGHT.

800
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,440
TIME FLIES.

801
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:39,050
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RETIRE,ARE YOU?

802
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:42,210
ADELE,YOU SPRING THIS ON ME TODAY.

803
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:44,250
I-I NEED MORE TIME.

804
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,120
I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE TIME TO GIVE.

805
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,470
TIME WAITS FOR NO MAN.

806
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,630
TIME HEALS ALL WOUNDS.

807
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:11,920
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL DAY?

808
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:14,590

823
00:41:30,730 --> 00:41:33,390
TIME TO LET GO...

824
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:40,560
TIME.
