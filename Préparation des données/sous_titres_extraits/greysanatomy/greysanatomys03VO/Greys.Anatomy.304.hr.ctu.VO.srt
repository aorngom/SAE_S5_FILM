1
00:00:04,031 --> 00:00:04,421
Who's Mark?

2
00:00:04,907 --> 00:00:06,852
Derek found us in bed together.

3
00:00:07,246 --> 00:00:08,221
You are in love with me.

4
00:00:08,864 --> 00:00:11,035
I'm well off, but I'm not into money,
and I'm hot.

5
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:15,371
I'm a catch. You know, if you can wrap
your head around the enlarged, failing heart

6
00:00:15,564 --> 00:00:16,975
and the dependency to I.V. Meds.

7
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,766
- I'm not ready for us to move in together.
- I'll be out in an hour.

8
00:00:20,166 --> 00:00:21,802
An hour ago, he was proposing.

9
00:00:22,346 --> 00:00:25,295
- Are you gonna tell Shepherd about...
- Not yet.

10
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,663
If I haven't made a decision by the
end of the day, I'm flipping a coin.

11
00:00:29,123 --> 00:00:30,763
A girl can only hold out for so long.

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,198
Grey's Anatomy - Episode 304

13
00:00:32,713 --> 00:00:33,615
"What I Am"

14
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,162
At some point during surgical residency,

15
00:00:42,718 --> 00:00:45,311
most interns get a sense of
who they are as doctors

16
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:47,710
and the kinds of surgeons
they're going to become.

17
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:50,971
If you ask them, they'll tell you--

18
00:00:51,755 --> 00:00:53,011
they're going to be general surgeons...

19
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:56,201
orthopedic surgeons...

20
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:58,940
neurosurgeons...

21
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:02,693
distinctions which do more than
describe their areas of expertise.

22
00:01:03,756 --> 00:01:05,032
<I>They help define who they are.

23
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,662
Because outside the operating room,

24
00:01:08,095 --> 00:01:10,412
<I>not only do most surgeons
have no idea who they are,

25
00:01:11,516 --> 00:01:12,822
they're afraid to find out.

26
00:01:20,338 --> 00:01:20,962
Time me.

27
00:01:21,428 --> 00:01:22,280
I've been timing you.

28
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:25,611
My last time was off by six seconds.

29
00:01:25,908 --> 00:01:27,882
Well, it's not about speed,
it's about accuracy.

30
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:29,253
I mean, your sutures are fine.

31
00:01:29,447 --> 00:01:32,632
My sutures are textbook.
The edges are perfectly aligned.

32
00:01:32,956 --> 00:01:34,541
Mm-hmm. You're ready.

33
00:01:35,105 --> 00:01:37,533
- I need more chickens.
- No more chickens, okay?

34
00:01:37,656 --> 00:01:40,432
It's bad enough that Meredith is dating
a vet. I'm not dating a chicken surgeon.

35
00:01:41,705 --> 00:01:43,963
Stop second-guessing.
It's not like you.

36
00:01:45,106 --> 00:01:47,521
Your hand is fine, and Shepherd
will clear you for surgery.

37
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:54,860
- Cristina.
- Yeah, baby?

38
00:01:58,155 --> 00:01:58,710
- Nothing.

39
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:13,662
So Izzie left the house this morning.
That's a good sign.

40
00:02:14,627 --> 00:02:17,572
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm just not feeling like myself.

41
00:02:18,107 --> 00:02:20,683
O'malley seems to have that
effect on women. Ask Dr. Torres.

42
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:24,562
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dude... You threw her out on her ass.

43
00:02:24,785 --> 00:02:25,391
I did not.

44
00:02:25,668 --> 00:02:26,342
Who told you that?

45
00:02:27,267 --> 00:02:27,771
Torres.

46
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:30,792
- Oh...
- Don't worry. I get it.

47
00:02:30,947 --> 00:02:32,102
She's hot, but she's not for you.

48
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:33,463
Why is that?

49
00:02:33,887 --> 00:02:35,323
- Because she's hot.
- Mm.

50
00:02:36,345 --> 00:02:37,413
- Callie.
- Mnh-mnh.

51
00:02:37,546 --> 00:02:39,143
Hey, come on. Wait.

52
00:02:39,495 --> 00:02:41,063
Before you start yelling, you were right.

53
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:43,893
I should have told you how
I felt about you moving in,

54
00:02:45,015 --> 00:02:46,782
not that you were moving in. It's just,

55
00:02:47,238 --> 00:02:52,442
I'm not good at the whole...
"talking about feelings" thing.

56
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,990
I bet you told Meredith how
you felt, though, didn't you?

57
00:02:54,288 --> 00:02:55,050
And Izzie--

58
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:56,883
you don't seem to have any trouble
talking to them, George, but me--

59
00:02:57,107 --> 00:03:01,301
Let's go, people. I've been in surgery
since 2:00 A.M. I'm in no mood.

60
00:03:01,685 --> 00:03:02,110
George.

61
00:03:05,546 --> 00:03:06,392
I miss you.

62
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:12,851
No cutting. No cutting.
- Yang, you're late!

63
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:14,933
Hey, I got here before George.
- I'm here. I was here.

64
00:03:15,468 --> 00:03:16,840
Nice of you to join us, Yang.

65
00:03:17,337 --> 00:03:19,673
Yeah, what are you smiling about?
Aren't you supposed to be on the gynie brigade?

66
00:03:19,735 --> 00:03:20,252
Yeah, whatever.

67
00:03:21,778 --> 00:03:22,500
Woman troubles?

68
00:03:22,975 --> 00:03:24,171
Oh. Men troubles.

69
00:03:24,317 --> 00:03:26,451
I think this dating two guys
thing is getting to me,

70
00:03:26,786 --> 00:03:27,450
the stress of it.

71
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:29,461
Finn, Derek, Derek, Finn.

72
00:03:30,618 --> 00:03:31,680
I think I'm getting an ulcer.

73
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:34,703
McDreamy and The Vet are making you sick?
- I just need to make a choice

74
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:35,641
and get it over with.

75
00:03:36,177 --> 00:03:37,183
Shawn Sullivan, 62,

76
00:03:37,296 --> 00:03:41,150
had minimally invasive bypass surgery two
days ago to remove a blockage from his L.A.D.--

77
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:42,761
But  I'm all better now.
Thank you, George.

78
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:46,941
So what do you think, Miranda? Can I stop being
a burden to you good people and go on home?

79
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:50,880
You need to stop interrupting the doctors, Shawny.
You just need to listen to what they say.

80
00:03:51,216 --> 00:03:54,562
I need to get back to the dealership.
They're gonna can me if I'm out too long.

81
00:03:54,705 --> 00:03:57,913
They can't can you, sweetie. You're the best salesman they got. Come on.

82
00:03:58,015 --> 00:03:58,910
What do you sell?
- Cars.

83
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:01,351
My shawny could sell... anything.

84
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:02,751
Yeah, I believe he can.

85
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:07,200
What he can't sell me on is going back to
work before he gets his oxygen levels up.

86
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:10,293
So you put that oxygen
back on, Mr. Sullivan,

87
00:04:10,446 --> 00:04:12,192
before I even think about
letting you out of here.

88
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:15,300
You know, and if I do, I want your word--

89
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:18,302
nothing fried, no alcohol
and no cigarettes.

90
00:04:18,827 --> 00:04:21,713
- Boy, you're tough, Miranda.
- I need your word, Mr. Sullivan,

91
00:04:21,855 --> 00:04:23,443
or I'm not gonna sign
those discharge papers.

92
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:24,512
I give you my word.

93
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:26,233
Hmm. All right, then.

94
00:04:27,065 --> 00:04:29,801
Mrs. Sullivan, you need to go to the
front desk to fill out some paperwork,

95
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:31,500
and then you can take
your husband home.

96
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:33,021
How are we doing, guys?

97
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:36,070
She's at 8 centimeters, but the
baby's still at minus 3 station.

98
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:38,350
So what do we do, uh,

99
00:04:38,946 --> 00:04:40,771
patterned breathing, squatting?

100
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:42,582
Dude, squatting?

101
00:04:42,797 --> 00:04:45,563
Dr. Karev, how do we normally
proceed in a situation like this?

102
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:47,703
We monitor the baby's progress.

103
00:04:48,027 --> 00:04:50,113
If the descent stops entirely
during active labor,

104
00:04:50,667 --> 00:04:52,043
we perform a c-section.

105
00:04:52,205 --> 00:04:53,103
Not on me, you don't.

106
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,240
I'm sorry, Dr. Karev, but...

107
00:04:55,506 --> 00:04:57,331
Jeff and I have a natural birth plan,

108
00:04:57,467 --> 00:05:01,253
and Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd promised us that...
-I promised that we would do what we can,

109
00:05:01,385 --> 00:05:04,343
but if your labor intensifies and the baby doesn't descend--

110
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:06,860
Well, then we'll wait until he does, right?

111
00:05:09,218 --> 00:05:10,332
I'm not having a c-section.

112
00:05:10,865 --> 00:05:14,173
A c-section is actually the safest way...
- To what, avoid a lawsuit?

113
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:15,580
We don't have to decide right now.

114
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:18,321
I'm not gonna miss out on an experience
that my body was made for

115
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:19,912
just because it's more
convenient for you.

116
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,422
You all right, Dr. Grey?

117
00:05:28,636 --> 00:05:30,861
Yeah, Dr. Bailey. I just...

118
00:05:36,668 --> 00:05:38,500
Need to make a choice is all.

119
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:42,982
Karev. Dr. Grey, I am clipping a
basilar tip aneurysm. Any interest?

120
00:05:51,287 --> 00:05:51,920
Dr. Bailey, can I get...

121
00:05:56,315 --> 00:05:56,951
Oh, my God.

122
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:06,072
Oh... my... God. - Oh, my God.

123
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:07,930
Is that... McSteamy.

124
00:06:13,955 --> 00:06:15,493
No, Mr. Sullivan,
don't light that!

125
00:06:22,266 --> 00:06:22,911
Somebody get a fire extinguisher!

126
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:24,391
Call a code red.

127
00:06:31,617 --> 00:06:34,361
Make sure he has an airway.
Sir, can you hear me? Sir?

128
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:37,412
No, he's out. Hit his head.
Small hematoma in the occipital region.

129
00:06:37,786 --> 00:06:39,772
Get him to the burn unit till he's
stabilized, and then get a C.T.

130
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:43,933
- Go.
- Right away, doctor. Come on.

131
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,253
- You're burning up.
- I'm fine.

132
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:50,983
You don't look fine. You look
beautiful, but you don't look fine.

133
00:06:51,355 --> 00:06:54,082
-  Now I'm gonna throw up.
- Go, you have aneurysms to clip

134
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,882
and surgeons to confront.

135
00:06:58,247 --> 00:06:59,891
- You're gonna be all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

136
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:01,090
- Will you look after her, please?
- Mm-hmm.

137
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:03,790
You think I'd miss this?

138
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:08,212
- What kind of idiot lights a cigarette in a hospital?
- Apparently people do idiotic things all the time.

139
00:07:13,557 --> 00:07:15,113
Chief. Chief.

140
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:19,290
I thought you were going back to New York.

141
00:07:19,846 --> 00:07:20,893
I thought it was time for a change.

142
00:07:21,165 --> 00:07:22,803
You can't do this. You can't be here.

143
00:07:23,216 --> 00:07:24,822
Sure I can. It was easy.

144
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:27,723
Sublet the apartment,
sold the practice.

145
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,758
He is a liar and a cheat.

146
00:07:29,923 --> 00:07:32,195
The man is one of the finest
plastic surgeons in this country.

147
00:07:32,317 --> 00:07:35,183
His department will generate twice
the revenue neurosurgery does.

148
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:36,140
Money, that's why he's here?

149
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:38,910
Why do you think I'm here?
- This? This is why I left you.

150
00:07:39,198 --> 00:07:40,322
I thought you left me for Derek.

151
00:07:40,476 --> 00:07:42,433
I left New York because of him.

152
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,723
He was your best friend for years.

153
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:46,690
Right up until the point where
he had sex with my wife.

154
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:47,751
We all make mistakes.

155
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:52,082
Holy crap! Are you pregnant?

156
00:07:58,765 --> 00:07:59,643
Oh, this is just perfect...

157
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,331
- An adulterous love child.
- Goes along with an adulterous sociopath.

158
00:08:08,918 --> 00:08:09,491
Meredith.

159
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:11,931
Unh-unh. You've done
enough already.

160
00:08:12,176 --> 00:08:12,793
Meredith.

161
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:16,860
Oh, uh, doctor, I-I finished
filling out the paperwork.

162
00:08:17,037 --> 00:08:18,471
When do you think I can
take Shawny home?

163
00:08:20,055 --> 00:08:21,103
Um...

164
00:08:25,615 --> 00:08:26,833
So who's the father?

165
00:08:27,065 --> 00:08:28,071
I'm not pregnant.

166
00:08:28,645 --> 00:08:30,323
I didn't think I was pregnant
when I was pregnant, either.

167
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:33,101
But the abdominal pain, fever
and the nonstop vomiting--

168
00:08:33,257 --> 00:08:34,340
I'm not pregnant.

169
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:36,470
You don't know who
the father is, do you?

170
00:08:37,927 --> 00:08:40,693
It would have to be Derek's.
There's no way it could be Finn's.

171
00:08:41,496 --> 00:08:42,912
You haven't had sex
with the vet yet?

172
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,382
Well, you gotta get outta
that relationship, immediately.

173
00:08:46,755 --> 00:08:48,342
Oh, I can't be pregnant, can I?

174
00:08:48,966 --> 00:08:51,251
- With McBaby.
- Oh!

175
00:08:51,637 --> 00:08:53,080
Was I this mean to you
when you were pregnant?

176
00:08:53,236 --> 00:08:54,332
Oh, I thought you said
you weren't pregnant.

177
00:08:54,497 --> 00:08:56,813
She's not. We'll have
to run more tests.

178
00:08:57,486 --> 00:08:59,182
In that case, can I have
some morphine?

179
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:05,221
I want you checking the
fetal monitor every 30 minutes.

180
00:09:05,616 --> 00:09:06,180
What's the point?

181
00:09:06,888 --> 00:09:08,551
The baby's nowhere near
where it needs to be,

182
00:09:08,827 --> 00:09:10,130
and you know you're
gonna have to cut her open,

183
00:09:10,246 --> 00:09:10,982
so why not get it over with?

184
00:09:11,607 --> 00:09:13,103
Because it's not what the patient wants.

185
00:09:13,435 --> 00:09:15,031
And it's our job as doctors

186
00:09:15,198 --> 00:09:18,360
to balance the desires of the patient
against the risk of complications.

187
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:20,472
So if the patient wants to have a natural birth--

188
00:09:20,655 --> 00:09:22,791
so if the patient wants a
natural birth, it's not surgical.

189
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:25,143
So why not just cut me loose
and let me in on a surgery?

190
00:09:25,325 --> 00:09:26,390
I might actually learn something.

191
00:09:26,578 --> 00:09:29,313
- Like Sloan's burn case.
- I'm going into plastics anyway.

192
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:31,460
Do  you think that Mark Sloan
has anything to teach you?

193
00:09:31,576 --> 00:09:33,693
He is just like you. He is only
looking out for himself.

194
00:09:33,825 --> 00:09:36,083
So what? Your patient's
looking out for herself,

195
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:38,323
you're looking out for yourself
- No, I'm not, actually.

196
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:39,612
Well, maybe you should be.

197
00:09:42,507 --> 00:09:44,933
Go. Go find Sloan.
Do whatever you want.

198
00:09:45,065 --> 00:09:46,853
Just get out of my face, Karev.
Go!

199
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:58,083
- You know, I'm not saying he's a bad doctor.
- Of course not. Listen--

200
00:09:58,225 --> 00:10:00,302
I'm--I'm saying that he's,
like, a bad person.

201
00:10:00,656 --> 00:10:02,370
The man has no morality, no ethics.

202
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:04,262
Yeah. But there's no pain,
there's no numbness,

203
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:05,092
but, um...
- I mean,

204
00:10:05,206 --> 00:10:07,393
The question is do we really want our
interns learning from somebody like that?

205
00:10:07,706 --> 00:10:08,531
Derek, my arm.

206
00:10:09,306 --> 00:10:11,150
Yeah. Oh, it's good. It's great.

207
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,500
You have great
range of motion.

208
00:10:12,736 --> 00:10:13,720
I  can clear you for surgery.

209
00:10:13,915 --> 00:10:16,550
- Really? You're sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

210
00:10:17,357 --> 00:10:18,172
Complete recovery.

211
00:10:18,956 --> 00:10:21,083
You're not having any problems, right?
- No. Uh...

212
00:10:21,815 --> 00:10:24,101
I-I've been doing his physical
therapy with him every night, so...

213
00:10:24,848 --> 00:10:26,382
He's perfect. He's Burke.

214
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:28,712
Good. Glad to hear it.
Welcome back, Dr. Burke.

215
00:10:29,156 --> 00:10:29,620
Yeah.

216
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:32,393
Uh, Dr. Bailey wanted to know
if you still needed an intern?

217
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:34,651
No, I'm fine.
How's, uh, Dr. Grey?

218
00:10:35,046 --> 00:10:36,973
Oh, she's not pregnant
with anyone's baby, so..

219
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:54,203
Izzie... Good to see you.

220
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:57,933
You want some lunch?

221
00:10:58,427 --> 00:10:59,290
I'm meeting somebody.

222
00:10:59,555 --> 00:11:00,171
Anybody I know?

223
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:02,422
Actually, I don't even know him.

224
00:11:03,266 --> 00:11:03,862
You never met?

225
00:11:05,516 --> 00:11:06,391
Know what he looks like?

226
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:09,241
So for all you know, he could be an older,

227
00:11:09,437 --> 00:11:11,860
rugged, ex-marine-looking dude?

228
00:11:17,576 --> 00:11:18,330
Dr. Stevens?

229
00:11:19,988 --> 00:11:20,701
Mr. Duquette.

230
00:11:22,477 --> 00:11:24,642
Please... Call me Denny.

231
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:30,741
Pretty girl.

232
00:11:33,878 --> 00:11:35,022
Not Denny's type at all.

233
00:11:37,106 --> 00:11:37,623
Really?

234
00:11:39,106 --> 00:11:39,800
What was his type?

235
00:11:40,675 --> 00:11:41,373
Um...

236
00:11:42,546 --> 00:11:44,071
Dark-haired girls, smart.

237
00:11:46,007 --> 00:11:47,241
Uh... well, not that you're not smart.

238
00:11:48,136 --> 00:11:49,660
You're a doctor. Obviously--

239
00:11:49,977 --> 00:11:52,003
I was. I was a doctor.
I'm not anymore.

240
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,171
Oh, that's right.

241
00:11:54,098 --> 00:11:55,261
Dr. Webber said you'd quit.

242
00:11:57,286 --> 00:11:59,781
You... talked to Dr. Webber?

243
00:12:00,497 --> 00:12:01,101
Uh, yes,

244
00:12:01,316 --> 00:12:02,100
and he said that, well,

245
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:04,090
if I wanted to hear the whole
story, I should talk to you.

246
00:12:04,228 --> 00:12:05,881
So if you don't mind, Dr. Stevens...
- Izzie.

247
00:12:06,735 --> 00:12:09,000
Izzie... If you don't mind,

248
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:11,901
I need to hear the whole story.

249
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,411
Dr. Sloan.

250
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:20,873
You my intern?

251
00:12:21,238 --> 00:12:22,543
Yeah. Uh, I'm your intern.

252
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:23,753
My face... oh.

253
00:12:24,105 --> 00:12:25,230
No need to talk, Mr. Sullivan.

254
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:26,371
That's gonna be painful for a while.

255
00:12:26,736 --> 00:12:27,441
My face.

256
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:30,500
He wants to know that you can fix his face.

257
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:32,012
He needs to know that you can fix it.

258
00:12:32,136 --> 00:12:33,961
I'm going to remove the burned tissue

259
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:36,560
and then bandage your face
with a dressing of live cells.

260
00:12:36,686 --> 00:12:39,152
And that'll do it? His face
will be back like it was?

261
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:41,691
Because his face was-- it's a nice face.

262
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:44,662
He's a salesman.

263
00:12:45,985 --> 00:12:48,071
I'm gonna do absolutely
everything I can, Mrs. Sullivan.

264
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:51,333
We'll need a neuro consult
before we operate.

265
00:12:51,668 --> 00:12:54,162
Anything  else? I mean, uh,
I could do debridement or, uh--

266
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:55,473
Actually, there is one more thing.

267
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:58,831
Bone dry cappuccino.
Make it a double.

268
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:05,622
You're a good friend.
- You are so high right now.

269
00:13:06,017 --> 00:13:08,592
Actually, you're my best friend
in the whole entire world.

270
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:10,392
Now I just feel sorry for you.

271
00:13:10,687 --> 00:13:12,800
Why? Because I could die today?

272
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:15,140
This is why I hate being
around stoned people.

273
00:13:15,406 --> 00:13:16,573
And if I did die today,

274
00:13:16,677 --> 00:13:20,291
I'd only be remembered as the
slutty intern who dated two doctors.

275
00:13:20,407 --> 00:13:21,811
No, one doctor, one vet.

276
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:24,013
Derek, Finn.
Derek or Finn?

277
00:13:24,435 --> 00:13:26,500
I'd die as the girl who couldn't
make a choice, right?

278
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:30,072
Probably. But none of that matters,
because you'll be dead.

279
00:13:30,917 --> 00:13:34,101
Dr. Grey... You've got a
fever, high white count

280
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:37,031
and tenderness over
McBurney's point, which suggests--

281
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:38,873
appendicitis.

282
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:42,402
Dr. O'malley, prep Dr. Grey for
surgery. You're scrubbing in.

283
00:13:42,565 --> 00:13:43,882
I am, in Meredith's appendectomy?

284
00:13:44,127 --> 00:13:44,881
I, uh...

285
00:13:45,038 --> 00:13:46,811
Am I the only one who remembers the last time

286
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:48,750
George scrubbed in on an appendectomy?

287
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,742
He almost killed the guy. Sorry, George.

288
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:52,750
I don't have to scrub in, Dr. Bailey. I could just, uh...

289
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:56,010
uh... unless you want me to, which...

290
00:13:56,147 --> 00:13:58,662
no. It's not gonna happen again.

291
00:13:58,977 --> 00:14:00,263
That good enough for you, Dr. Grey?

292
00:14:01,927 --> 00:14:03,213
You're pretty.

293
00:14:08,008 --> 00:14:09,402
George! Ice chips.

294
00:14:13,276 --> 00:14:15,512
- Hey.
- I, uh, heard Meredith's having an appy.

295
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:17,050
It wasn't my idea to scrub in.

296
00:14:17,187 --> 00:14:20,421
- I tried to get out of it.
- George... I was just...

297
00:14:21,716 --> 00:14:23,630
I just thought maybe we could have
a late supper at the Archfield.

298
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:26,191
Why would we have dinner at a hotel?

299
00:14:26,648 --> 00:14:27,973
Because they bring it right to your room.

300
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:30,961
You're staying at the Archfield.

301
00:14:31,515 --> 00:14:32,722
How--how are you affording that?

302
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:35,541
I still have some secrets, O'Malley.

303
00:14:35,935 --> 00:14:38,640
And if you come see me tonight,
I just might show you one or two.

304
00:14:42,017 --> 00:14:43,241
I was just checking on the Sullivans,

305
00:14:43,806 --> 00:14:45,651
and how is he doing because he...
- You are?

306
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:48,571
Dr. Bailey. We met this morning.

307
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,810
I was the resident on
Mr. Sullivan's bypass.

308
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:53,580
Well, I don't need a resident on this case, so...

309
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,772
Excuse me. I wasn't asking
to be your resident.

310
00:14:55,898 --> 00:14:58,041
I was asking how my patient was doing.

311
00:14:58,168 --> 00:14:59,122
He's not your patient anymore.

312
00:15:03,448 --> 00:15:06,251
Hey, so congratulations. I told you.

313
00:15:07,026 --> 00:15:09,351
- Yeah.
- What? What?

314
00:15:11,395 --> 00:15:12,781
Shepherd shouldn't have cleared me.

315
00:15:13,176 --> 00:15:14,650
Burke, you're back.
You're back and you're fine.

316
00:15:16,948 --> 00:15:18,112
- Burke.
- What?

317
00:15:18,427 --> 00:15:18,771
What?

318
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:25,140
He just... shouldn't have cleared me.

319
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:30,553
Another contraction,
Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

320
00:15:31,226 --> 00:15:34,431
You're fully dilated. But the
baby's only at minus 2 station.

321
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,022
- He just needs more time.
- We don't have it, Rebecca.

322
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:39,313
His heart rate's slowing
with each contraction.

323
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:41,343
If he starts having late decels, I...

324
00:15:41,455 --> 00:15:44,340
- Is he having late decels?
- Not yet, but...

325
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:47,780
Then stop trying to scare me into
an operation I told you I don't want.

326
00:15:48,427 --> 00:15:49,470
I have a birth plan.

327
00:15:50,678 --> 00:15:54,041
Look, I'm not-- I'm not gonna be
one of those weak-ass women

328
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,403
who give all that up the minute
things start to get scary. I...

329
00:15:58,117 --> 00:16:01,220
- Rebecca... your birth plan is just that, it's a plan.

330
00:16:01,348 --> 00:16:03,973
- Jeff, get her out of here.
- Honey, I think she's just trying to be cautious...

331
00:16:04,108 --> 00:16:09,750
Just get out! Just get out!
Get out! Aah!! Get out!

332
00:16:18,337 --> 00:16:20,051
Since when do you "get out"?

333
00:16:21,836 --> 00:16:23,402
Clearly, I am not myself today.

334
00:16:24,165 --> 00:16:26,622
Never would've figured
Mark Sloan to be your type.

335
00:16:27,327 --> 00:16:31,620
He's  not. He's not.
What is he doing here?

336
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,681
He's not supposed to be here.

337
00:16:33,797 --> 00:16:34,881
I can't have him here. I can't.

338
00:16:35,447 --> 00:16:37,020
He's supposed to be
in New York. I can't--

339
00:16:38,025 --> 00:16:39,503
I can't function with him here.

340
00:16:39,615 --> 00:16:41,751
I'm a professional here.
People respect me here.

341
00:16:41,857 --> 00:16:43,332
But when he's here, I'm just--I'm--

342
00:16:43,426 --> 00:16:46,893
A woman who gets the hots for
man-candy and cheats on her husband.

343
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:49,601
That is rude... and unkind...

344
00:16:50,798 --> 00:16:52,210
And completely true.

345
00:16:52,376 --> 00:16:53,922
Oh, my god. What am I gonna do?

346
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:57,340
For starters, you can keep your
knees closed in his presence.

347
00:16:57,587 --> 00:16:58,951
- Miranda.
- You asked.

348
00:16:59,418 --> 00:17:02,361
And also, you can remember that no man--

349
00:17:02,757 --> 00:17:06,613
not Derek, not Mark-- defines who you are.

350
00:17:14,145 --> 00:17:15,703
Well, let's see-- your complexion is flushed...

351
00:17:17,868 --> 00:17:18,912
abdominal wall is tender.

352
00:17:20,757 --> 00:17:22,440
Are you happy you have a boyfriend
who works in a hospital?

353
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:28,393
You... are just one of many men that I
happen to be dating at the moment.

354
00:17:28,496 --> 00:17:29,550
Really?
- Mm-hmm.

355
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:30,530
How many of us are there?

356
00:17:30,827 --> 00:17:35,773
Uh... well, there's, uh, you...
- Hm-hmm.

357
00:17:36,047 --> 00:17:38,273
And Finn and...

358
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:41,721
well, forgive me for
pointing out the obvious,

359
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:44,603
but I don't see any practitioners of
veterinarian medicine at your bedside.

360
00:17:44,918 --> 00:17:45,871
You would if you turned around.

361
00:17:47,598 --> 00:17:48,450
Ah, Finn.

362
00:17:49,377 --> 00:17:50,232
Derek.

363
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:55,492
Oh, can I just say how much it helps
that I am on drugs right now?

364
00:17:57,388 --> 00:17:59,000
- So.
- So.

365
00:17:59,717 --> 00:18:01,200
So how's life in the animal kingdom?

366
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:02,913
What about you, Derek?
Slow day?

367
00:18:05,557 --> 00:18:07,622
If you need to take off, that's...
- No, it's fine. I can stay.

368
00:18:08,037 --> 00:18:09,143
- Great.
- Great.

369
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:12,271
- Great.
- Okay, let's get you prepped and ready for...

370
00:18:13,196 --> 00:18:16,823
- Dr. Shepherd. Dr. Finn.
- Now all my boys are here.

371
00:18:17,436 --> 00:18:20,403
You're all so handsome...
and such good kissers.

372
00:18:20,758 --> 00:18:21,422
Oh, God.

373
00:18:22,498 --> 00:18:23,242
Excuse me?

374
00:18:23,857 --> 00:18:24,702
She's on drugs.

375
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,803
He's an excellent kisser.

376
00:18:27,215 --> 00:18:28,753
- You two... dated?
- You didn't know?

377
00:18:28,937 --> 00:18:31,613
It wasn't a date so much as a

378
00:18:32,175 --> 00:18:37,290
disastrously uncomfortable sexual experience.

379
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:39,810
Oh... I-I-- I can't be here.

380
00:18:40,065 --> 00:18:42,420
None of you can be here.
This woman is being prepped for surgery,

381
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,803
which means you all need to leave.

382
00:18:44,115 --> 00:18:45,733
- Gladly.
- Now! Not you, O'Malley.

383
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:48,703
Dr. Bailey, all my boyfriends are here.

384
00:18:48,847 --> 00:18:50,263
Not for long. Say good-bye, Dr. Grey.

385
00:18:50,396 --> 00:18:51,772
- I'll be here when you wake up.
- So will I.

386
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:52,733
- Now!

387
00:19:04,465 --> 00:19:05,131
What are you doing?

388
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:09,470
What does it look like I'm doing?

389
00:19:09,928 --> 00:19:12,600
You're not in med school. You don't need
to practice procedures on a corpse.

390
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:14,902
Better than on a patient.

391
00:19:15,227 --> 00:19:17,701
- Burke, your hand is fine.
- Right.

392
00:19:20,587 --> 00:19:22,513
Are you... mad at me?

393
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,083
Hey, hey, you're mad at me?

394
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:30,880
Forget it.

395
00:19:31,306 --> 00:19:33,782
Just... don't worry about it.

396
00:19:34,057 --> 00:19:34,942
You have patients.

397
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:36,601
I'm on call for the pit.

398
00:19:36,897 --> 00:19:38,722
- Cristina--
- I-I am not leaving.

399
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:47,830
Time me.

400
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:54,750
The transplant went better than
anyone expected, and he was better.

401
00:19:55,076 --> 00:19:57,463
He was... so much better.

402
00:19:58,767 --> 00:19:59,843
But Denny, um...

403
00:20:01,246 --> 00:20:03,542
before the surgery, he was hooked
up to a machine called--

404
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:04,731
you're not answering my question.

405
00:20:05,656 --> 00:20:07,450
I'm trying. I-I'm getting there.

406
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,531
It--it was complicated,
and his heart was--

407
00:20:09,688 --> 00:20:10,883
I don't give a damn about the medicine.

408
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:13,593
I know what killed my son.

409
00:20:17,127 --> 00:20:20,443
He had a bad heart. He had a bad
heart for a long time. I get that.

410
00:20:21,235 --> 00:20:25,591
What I don't get... is how a girl like you
goes from being my son's doctor to-

411
00:20:26,095 --> 00:20:29,223
to his fiancée on the very day he's
supposed to get a new heart.

412
00:20:30,256 --> 00:20:34,011
What I don't get is how you got him to
propose to you hours before he died.

413
00:20:36,846 --> 00:20:37,470
Mr. Sullivan,

414
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:40,953
I'm gonna recommend a night
of observation in the I.C.U.

415
00:20:41,108 --> 00:20:43,552
Before Dr. Sloan proceeds with your surgery. - Oh.

416
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,660
Is that really necessary, Dr. Shepherd?

417
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:49,843
The longer we wait, the higher the risk of infection.

418
00:20:50,288 --> 00:20:52,563
I think it's important that we attend to
potential life-threatening injuries

419
00:20:52,686 --> 00:20:54,833
before moving on to cosmetic, Dr. Sloan.

420
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:57,481
He's not here for a face-lift, Derek.
He's a burn victim.

421
00:20:57,607 --> 00:20:59,670
Why did you ask for a consult if you've
already established a course of action?

422
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:01,263
Because I thought you were good enough at your job

423
00:21:01,355 --> 00:21:02,710
to put aside the personal and do
what's best for the patient.

424
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,342
My job? You're telling me how to do my job?

425
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:05,262
Now you're telling me how to do my--

426
00:21:05,387 --> 00:21:07,892
Please, I'm sure it's complicated. And I know
Shawny's sorry for lighting that smoke.

427
00:21:08,098 --> 00:21:10,552
He was trying to keep his
word to Dr. Bailey.

428
00:21:10,766 --> 00:21:13,701
He told her he wasn't gonna smoke
when he got home, and he was...

429
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:15,872
Just trying to keep his word.

430
00:21:16,688 --> 00:21:17,731
He knows he did wrong.

431
00:21:18,935 --> 00:21:23,640
But he'd... he's a salesman. That's who he is.

432
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:25,933
So could you please just fix his face?

433
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,170
Could you do that for us, please?

434
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,042
If what happened between me and
Addison is so unforgivable,

435
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,633
how do you justify what happened
between you and Meredith?

436
00:21:39,776 --> 00:21:40,812
What the hell are you talking about?

437
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:42,362
You need me to be the bad guy? Fine.

438
00:21:42,837 --> 00:21:44,420
But I'm not the only bad guy here, Derek.

439
00:21:44,565 --> 00:21:46,382
You and me, we're the same.

440
00:21:53,155 --> 00:21:56,960
Addison. Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

441
00:21:58,878 --> 00:22:00,603
You bellowed, Dr. Grey.

442
00:22:01,097 --> 00:22:03,353
- Hi.
- You certainly are, aren't you?

443
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:09,871
But you're not pregnant.

444
00:22:11,116 --> 00:22:11,882
No.

445
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:16,900
Are you okay?

446
00:22:17,695 --> 00:22:18,431
Fine.

447
00:22:19,816 --> 00:22:21,223
How are you?

448
00:22:22,236 --> 00:22:24,342
I'm trying to choose between two men.

449
00:22:25,236 --> 00:22:28,473
Okay, well, good luck with that.

450
00:22:30,008 --> 00:22:31,930
How did you know
Derek was the one?

451
00:22:35,798 --> 00:22:36,563
Excuse me?

452
00:22:37,736 --> 00:22:39,393
I know you hate me and all,

453
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:42,040
and you don't owe me anything.

454
00:22:43,345 --> 00:22:48,553
Nothing. No... thing.

455
00:22:51,635 --> 00:22:52,702
What was I saying?

456
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:53,540
Derek.

457
00:22:54,518 --> 00:22:55,201
Right.

458
00:22:58,017 --> 00:22:59,873
I want him to be the one.

459
00:23:01,578 --> 00:23:04,930
But I would know if he was the
one, right? You knew, right?

460
00:23:12,258 --> 00:23:12,892
You don't...

461
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:17,091
I didn't... know. I just...

462
00:23:19,635 --> 00:23:20,893
Derek's the kind of guy...

463
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:24,550
I just knew he wouldn't hurt me.

464
00:23:26,186 --> 00:23:28,220
I mean, not on purpose, anyway,

465
00:23:28,387 --> 00:23:29,483
not the way I hurt him.

466
00:23:32,888 --> 00:23:33,872
He hurt me...

467
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,121
when he chose you.

468
00:23:38,888 --> 00:23:39,970
I should've let him go.

469
00:23:41,406 --> 00:23:44,751
I should've stepped aside,
been a better person.

470
00:23:45,935 --> 00:23:47,452
I... should've...

471
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:49,682
a lot of things.

472
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:53,393
Me, too.

473
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:55,091
A lot of things.

474
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,472
I don't hate you.

475
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:03,061
How come we never talked
like this before?

476
00:24:03,717 --> 00:24:06,023
The only reason we are
talking like this right now

477
00:24:07,306 --> 00:24:09,883
is because I know you won't
remember a single word of this

478
00:24:10,066 --> 00:24:11,790
once the drugs wear off.

479
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:18,281
Dr. Karev, you need to see this.

480
00:24:18,647 --> 00:24:19,760
I'm off the case.
Page Dr. Montgomery-Shepherd.

481
00:24:19,937 --> 00:24:20,661
We did, but...

482
00:24:22,108 --> 00:24:22,750
oh, man.

483
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:25,962
Were you just
talking to Meredith?

484
00:24:26,927 --> 00:24:27,670
Yeah.

485
00:24:31,575 --> 00:24:32,143
What?

486
00:24:35,688 --> 00:24:36,803
Don't, um...

487
00:24:38,898 --> 00:24:40,353
Don't hurt her again.

488
00:24:44,718 --> 00:24:46,520
- You planning on killing a woman today?
- What?

489
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:49,531
The c-section you should've performed
on Rebecca Bloom this morning?

490
00:24:49,718 --> 00:24:52,082
At this point, it may be too
late for her and the baby.

491
00:24:52,605 --> 00:24:53,543
Nice work, doc.

492
00:24:53,798 --> 00:24:55,400
Get an O.R. and an anesthesiologist.

493
00:24:55,507 --> 00:24:56,823
We're doing a crash
c-section right away.

494
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:08,243
Oh! What is happening?

495
00:25:08,547 --> 00:25:10,260
Rebecca, your baby is having late decels.

496
00:25:10,836 --> 00:25:11,973
He's in distress.

497
00:25:12,117 --> 00:25:14,571
We have to get you into the delivery
room and get him out right now.

498
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:16,992
- Oh, no, please.
- This is no longer a conversation.

499
00:25:17,138 --> 00:25:20,432
I am your doctor, and I am responsible
for your life and your baby's life,

500
00:25:20,565 --> 00:25:23,252
and I'm not about to lose either
one of you, are we clear?

501
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:27,623
You just gonna stand there,
Karev, or are we doing this?

502
00:25:29,505 --> 00:25:30,482
Mr. Duquette, Denny and I--

503
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:32,900
he--he was my patient for months.

504
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:35,043
And the minute he died, you quit your job.

505
00:25:35,268 --> 00:25:36,911
- Because I couldn't..
- Four years of medical school,

506
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,300
now that's a whole lot of debt.

507
00:25:38,655 --> 00:25:40,893
How were you planning on
paying that back, huh?

508
00:25:41,285 --> 00:25:43,473
Did you think that Denny
would pay for everything?

509
00:25:44,005 --> 00:25:46,701
Why are you... what--
what are you talking about?

510
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:48,662
I'm talking about protecting my son.

511
00:25:48,828 --> 00:25:50,243
Oh, where were you
when he needed you?

512
00:25:51,226 --> 00:25:53,102
Because I was there the
whole time. I was there.

513
00:25:53,226 --> 00:25:57,793
I was working 80-hour weeks,
and I was still always there.

514
00:25:58,787 --> 00:26:00,123
He had so many surgeries,

515
00:26:00,986 --> 00:26:03,371
so many procedures.
He was so scared.

516
00:26:04,847 --> 00:26:06,671
Where were you then?
Where were you?

517
00:26:07,506 --> 00:26:08,321
You may not get me,

518
00:26:09,487 --> 00:26:11,370
but you don't have to because
I don't get you either.

519
00:26:11,726 --> 00:26:15,451
- I don't get how a father abandons his dying son.
- Wait. Wait.

520
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:20,822
Is that what he told you, that I--
that his mother and I abandoned him?

521
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:25,943
Well... he didn't tell you the truth.

522
00:26:39,897 --> 00:26:42,920
What? What?

523
00:26:45,017 --> 00:26:47,230
Oh, Burke. I thought you-- you told me--

524
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:50,602
- I can't hold it still long enough to attach the graft.
- You told me your hand was fine.

525
00:26:50,908 --> 00:26:52,410
- I can't--
- you told me your hand was fine.

526
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:53,420
It's not fine!

527
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:56,810
You wanted to believe I was fine.
You wanted me to be fine.

528
00:26:56,917 --> 00:27:00,823
You wanted-- I wanted-- damn it.

529
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:09,353
My hands... are the only things that
I have that are of any value to me, to you.

530
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:12,353
- Not to me--
- Oh, yes, to you. You want Preston Burke.

531
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:24,162
My hands... these are who I am.

532
00:27:25,236 --> 00:27:31,132
If I can't do this, if I can't
finish this surgery, then...

533
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:49,490
what if I hold the vessel?

534
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,921
what if I hold the vessel?

535
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:56,150
Come on.

536
00:27:58,978 --> 00:27:59,803
Burke...

537
00:28:01,018 --> 00:28:02,042
if I hold the vessel...

538
00:28:04,065 --> 00:28:05,912
- I can attach the graft.
- Okay, so...

539
00:28:07,545 --> 00:28:09,233
I--okay, I put my hand...

540
00:28:20,468 --> 00:28:21,653
Nobody has to know.

541
00:28:29,915 --> 00:28:32,933
Derek. Look, I know
you're mad at me,

542
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:34,710
but Mark Sloan is
the best in his field.

543
00:28:34,945 --> 00:28:37,413
Any surgical unit in this country
would be lucky to have him.

544
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:40,051
You did what you thought was best for this hospital.
- I did.

545
00:28:43,035 --> 00:28:45,491
Uh... are you all right?

546
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:49,221
Can I ask you a... personal question?

547
00:28:52,117 --> 00:28:53,622
Why did you leave Meredith's mother?

548
00:28:58,017 --> 00:28:59,713
I could've left Adele.

549
00:29:01,426 --> 00:29:02,773
I could've gone away with Ellis.

550
00:29:05,807 --> 00:29:08,600
But I would've had so much
baggage, so much guilt.

551
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:12,200
Ellis couldn't see it, but I wasn't...

552
00:29:15,107 --> 00:29:16,481
I never would've made her happy,

553
00:29:17,278 --> 00:29:18,601
not like she deserved to be happy.

554
00:29:21,397 --> 00:29:23,053
I was a better man for walking away.

555
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:26,661
I loved her enough to walk away.

556
00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:31,180
Oh, oh, on the table,
keep me draped.

557
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:33,770
Too many people have
seen me naked already.

558
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,321
I'd like to keep whatever dignity I have left.

559
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,050
McSteamy.

560
00:29:38,637 --> 00:29:40,153
Meredith--
- McSteamy! Whoo-hoo!

561
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:43,260
Is that what you're calling me now-- McSteamy?

562
00:29:43,586 --> 00:29:45,582
Yeah, but I don't think you
were supposed to know that.

563
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:47,183
How's my favorite dirty mistress?

564
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,020
Haven't you heard? Now
I'm an adulterous whore.

565
00:29:55,298 --> 00:29:56,520
He's so beautiful.

566
00:29:57,685 --> 00:29:58,391
Thank you.

567
00:29:58,795 --> 00:29:59,653
You're welcome.

568
00:30:07,577 --> 00:30:11,370
The appendix is out. Now
what do I do, O'Malley?

569
00:30:12,606 --> 00:30:16,441
You invert the stump into the cecum
and pull up on the purse strings.

570
00:30:16,865 --> 00:30:17,480
Show me.

571
00:30:19,165 --> 00:30:19,922
Okay.

572
00:30:24,507 --> 00:30:25,503
Where's my coffe Karev?

573
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:28,301
I got pulled into an
emergency c-section. Sorry.

574
00:30:28,586 --> 00:30:30,971
That's too bad. I was gonna let
you scrub in on a real surgery.

575
00:30:31,527 --> 00:30:35,062
Oh, well. Maybe next time...
if O.B. can spare you.

576
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:37,231
See ya.

577
00:30:42,218 --> 00:30:42,822
Finn.

578
00:30:43,477 --> 00:30:44,193
Derek.

579
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:45,592
She's still in surgery.

580
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:46,932
Yeah. Yeah, I figured
I'd wait for her here.

581
00:30:47,998 --> 00:30:49,611
Meredith, uh, tells me that you fish.

582
00:30:50,847 --> 00:30:51,682
She does?

583
00:30:52,076 --> 00:30:53,323
She tells me a lot of things.

584
00:30:55,705 --> 00:30:56,861
Have you been up to Cornet Bay?

585
00:30:57,776 --> 00:30:59,652
It's mostly chinook, some rockfish.

586
00:30:59,836 --> 00:31:01,342
- You fish?
- Yeah, as much as I can.

587
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:03,490
My wife hated it.

588
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:05,012
you had a wife?

589
00:31:05,636 --> 00:31:06,532
Yeah. She died.

590
00:31:08,008 --> 00:31:10,030
I'm sorry. I-I didn't know.

591
00:31:12,366 --> 00:31:14,431
Meredith doesn't tell you a lot of things. Only me.

592
00:31:15,238 --> 00:31:17,003
Yeah. Funny. Very funny.

593
00:31:17,815 --> 00:31:19,070
You know, when I heard that she was sick, I...

594
00:31:19,966 --> 00:31:21,470
People come through
appendectomies all the time.

595
00:31:22,788 --> 00:31:24,660
I mean, she'll be fine, right?
- Mm-hmm.

596
00:31:26,068 --> 00:31:28,061
You really like her, don't you?
- Yeah.

597
00:31:31,275 --> 00:31:32,241
You're a good guy.

598
00:31:32,637 --> 00:31:34,930
Uh, yeah, I think so. I-I hope so.

599
00:31:41,245 --> 00:31:42,131
Okay.

600
00:31:43,775 --> 00:31:44,973
- See you later.
- I'll see you.

601
00:31:47,415 --> 00:31:48,863
It was doctor after doctor.

602
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:52,531
Everybody had a--
had a different opinion.

603
00:31:52,747 --> 00:31:54,003
Everybody had a worse opinion.

604
00:31:55,896 --> 00:31:58,481
Before that, Denny had never
been sick a day in his life.

605
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:00,201
Before that, he had been...

606
00:32:04,057 --> 00:32:04,722
You know, the...

607
00:32:06,216 --> 00:32:08,300
The thought of having to bury your own son...

608
00:32:09,897 --> 00:32:11,860
His mother and I, we didn't--
we didn't handle it very well.

609
00:32:15,288 --> 00:32:18,871
One day, we came home and
found a note saying, uh,

610
00:32:19,355 --> 00:32:22,440
he didn't want us to have to
watch him die, that he left.

611
00:32:24,205 --> 00:32:28,310
We thought... we thought he
was dead all this time.

612
00:32:33,187 --> 00:32:34,023
I had no idea.

613
00:32:36,237 --> 00:32:38,053
Believe me, if I had known, I would...

614
00:32:39,115 --> 00:32:40,502
Never have let him get away with that.

615
00:32:42,946 --> 00:32:43,741
I believe it.

616
00:32:48,507 --> 00:32:50,340
I worked my way through med school.
- You--

617
00:32:50,988 --> 00:32:54,361
I paid off my debt.
- Look, I'm, uh, sorry about before.

618
00:32:54,575 --> 00:32:55,872
You--you don't have to explain--

619
00:32:56,056 --> 00:32:57,880
I do. I do.

620
00:32:58,078 --> 00:32:59,681
You're his dad and you're
trying to protect him.

621
00:33:01,106 --> 00:33:04,393
And I want you to know that
I've paid off all my debt.

622
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:06,443
And when I met Denny,

623
00:33:06,588 --> 00:33:07,480
I was gonna be a surgeon,

624
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:09,671
so I didn't need his money.

625
00:33:11,127 --> 00:33:12,271
I had everything I needed.

626
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:16,400
I had everything I needed un-until, um...

627
00:33:21,537 --> 00:33:22,243
We miss him.

628
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,911
My god, we miss him.

629
00:33:26,598 --> 00:33:27,423
Yeah.

630
00:33:28,385 --> 00:33:29,351
I, um...

631
00:33:31,735 --> 00:33:32,583
yeah.

632
00:33:42,137 --> 00:33:42,730
What is this?

633
00:33:43,557 --> 00:33:44,292
It's for you.

634
00:33:45,275 --> 00:33:46,291
It's from Denny.

635
00:33:56,775 --> 00:33:58,080
Hey. You ready to go?

636
00:34:01,017 --> 00:34:02,713
I'm sorry I have to do this,

637
00:34:03,325 --> 00:34:04,122
but I have to go home.

638
00:34:04,897 --> 00:34:05,793
It's Izzie.

639
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:14,000
It's always Izzie or Meredith.
It's... it's never me.

640
00:34:14,757 --> 00:34:17,051
Oh, come on. That is not true.

641
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:20,410
Who am I to you, George?

642
00:34:21,355 --> 00:34:24,073
Am I your girlfriend? Am I somebody
you mess around with?

643
00:34:25,466 --> 00:34:26,562
Do you even know?

644
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:30,510
well, guess what.

645
00:34:32,135 --> 00:34:34,090
Now you don't have to
bother figuring it out.

646
00:34:38,886 --> 00:34:39,930
How's he doing, Mrs. Sullivan?

647
00:34:40,596 --> 00:34:41,903
We're just getting an
update now, Dr. Bailey.

648
00:34:44,478 --> 00:34:45,300
The surgery went well.

649
00:34:45,855 --> 00:34:48,260
We removed the necrotic tissue,
applied the live cells,

650
00:34:48,537 --> 00:34:50,913
and if his body responds, in three or four weeks--

651
00:34:51,257 --> 00:34:52,282
He'll have his face back?

652
00:34:54,318 --> 00:34:55,313
Mr. And Mrs. Sullivan,

653
00:34:55,976 --> 00:34:58,792
Your face may never be exactly what it was.

654
00:34:59,558 --> 00:35:01,820
Even if everything goes perfectly well,
there will be scarring.

655
00:35:02,276 --> 00:35:03,203
But he's a salesman.

656
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:06,412
He has such a nice face.

657
00:35:15,317 --> 00:35:18,331
You have an incredible wife, Mr. Sullivan,

658
00:35:18,697 --> 00:35:22,192
And half a dozen car salesmen in
the lobby waiting to visit you.

659
00:35:23,028 --> 00:35:26,851
Your face may be different,
but you know as well as I do,

660
00:35:27,036 --> 00:35:28,382
it's not about what you look like

661
00:35:29,055 --> 00:35:31,951
Or your job or how successful you are.

662
00:35:32,777 --> 00:35:37,481
It's about having people in your life
that you love and who love you.

663
00:35:40,497 --> 00:35:41,800
That--that's all that matters.

664
00:35:51,505 --> 00:35:52,261
How you feeling?

665
00:35:52,827 --> 00:35:54,203
Oh, mortified.

666
00:35:55,065 --> 00:35:57,780
I was just explaining the "Meredith
on morphine" experience.

667
00:35:57,988 --> 00:35:59,022
Ahh. You don't remember?

668
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:00,162
Was it memorable?

669
00:36:02,255 --> 00:36:03,490
I'll let Finn tell you. I'll come back.

670
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:04,390
No, a-actually, I've--

671
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:05,990
I've just been sent on a
mission to get the, uh,

672
00:36:06,118 --> 00:36:07,910
patient's ice chips. Be right back.

673
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:12,330
How badly did I embarrass myself?

674
00:36:15,716 --> 00:36:16,310
What?

675
00:36:26,278 --> 00:36:28,450
You deserve to be with somebody
who makes you happy,

676
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:31,212
somebody who's not gonna
complicate your life,

677
00:36:32,897 --> 00:36:33,923
somebody who won't hurt you.

678
00:36:45,046 --> 00:36:46,973
He's a better guy, Meredith.

679
00:36:48,698 --> 00:36:49,472
Finn's the better guy.

680
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:54,102
Derek...

681
00:36:57,306 --> 00:36:58,373
I'm walking away.

682
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:22,850
He left a message.

683
00:37:24,516 --> 00:37:26,240
Denny left a message for
his parents the night...

684
00:37:30,435 --> 00:37:33,620
His father gave me the number
and the code, but, um...

685
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:38,163
I just couldn't do it alone.

686
00:37:48,786 --> 00:37:52,151
Addison... Can we talk?
- I don't want you here, Mark.

687
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:55,442
I think I've made that abundantly clear. So...

688
00:37:57,125 --> 00:37:58,662
If you insist on staying, just...

689
00:37:59,887 --> 00:38:02,522
Know that we're coworkers,
and nothing more.

690
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:07,580
Karev.

691
00:38:09,137 --> 00:38:11,813
As of right now, you are
officially off my service.

692
00:38:12,547 --> 00:38:13,401
But for what it's worth,

693
00:38:14,518 --> 00:38:15,491
I think you're gonna miss me.

694
00:38:19,496 --> 00:38:20,770
Hello, you've reached the Duquettes.

695
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:27,383
DENNY : Dad, Mom, it's me.

696
00:38:28,577 --> 00:38:30,232
DENNY : I'm calling from Seattle Grace hospital,

697
00:38:30,466 --> 00:38:35,432
DENNY : where the beautiful, talented and
incredibly stubborn Dr. Isobel Stevens

698
00:38:36,015 --> 00:38:38,321
DENNY : has just given me a brand-new
heart and promised to marry me.

699
00:38:40,978 --> 00:38:45,851
DENNY : I know we've had our differences,
and I'm sorry we've been out of touch.

700
00:38:47,117 --> 00:38:48,181
More chicken surgery?

701
00:38:50,198 --> 00:38:51,290
I'm making you dinner.

702
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:55,622
DENNY : Believe it or not, I was trying to make everything better.

703
00:38:57,018 --> 00:38:59,631
DENNY : I know you're angry.
I hope you'll forgive me.

704
00:39:01,358 --> 00:39:04,751
DENNY : Turns out, sometimes you have
to do the wrong thing...

705
00:39:06,288 --> 00:39:07,232
McSteamy, right?

706
00:39:09,155 --> 00:39:10,443
You must be a friend of Meredith's.

707
00:39:11,077 --> 00:39:13,920
Not really. Dr. Torres. Callie.

708
00:39:14,957 --> 00:39:15,753
Mark Sloan.

709
00:39:17,448 --> 00:39:18,722
Bad day?

710
00:39:21,365 --> 00:39:22,323
You could say that.

711
00:39:22,897 --> 00:39:24,293
- You?
- Oh, yeah.

712
00:39:26,286 --> 00:39:28,752
So what have you heard
about me, exactly?

713
00:39:29,945 --> 00:39:33,873
Mostly things that involve
the words "dirty" and "bad."

714
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:36,322
Right.

715
00:39:39,358 --> 00:39:42,162
I guess there, uh, really is no
starting over, is there?

716
00:39:47,225 --> 00:39:48,362
Can I buy you a drink, Callie?

717
00:39:59,277 --> 00:40:02,072
Only if you have it delivered to
my hotel room, because I'm off to bed.

718
00:40:08,025 --> 00:40:09,742
DENNY :Sometimes you have to make a big mistake...

719
00:40:10,846 --> 00:40:11,500
You comin'?

720
00:40:14,428 --> 00:40:16,112
DENNY : To figure out how to make things right.

721
00:40:16,568 --> 00:40:20,003
So what time do they let us visitors
start visiting in the morning?

722
00:40:24,558 --> 00:40:25,503
You shouldn't do that.

723
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:27,050
I don't mind.

724
00:40:28,017 --> 00:40:32,243
No, Finn. Really, you shouldn't do that.

725
00:40:44,507 --> 00:40:45,230
So it's Derek.

726
00:40:45,936 --> 00:40:46,711
I'm sorry.

727
00:40:54,205 --> 00:40:54,870
Can I ask why?

728
00:40:55,478 --> 00:40:57,160
You are a great guy...

729
00:40:58,306 --> 00:40:59,500
you're a wonderful guy,

730
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,772
and you may even be the better guy.

731
00:41:04,917 --> 00:41:05,643
But...

732
00:41:06,466 --> 00:41:08,820
- He's the one.
- And I wish he wasn't.

733
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:14,071
He's gonna hurt you again...

734
00:41:17,255 --> 00:41:19,630
And when he does,
I won't be here.

735
00:41:26,596 --> 00:41:27,443
DENNY : Mistakes are painful...

736
00:41:29,408 --> 00:41:30,750
Take care of
yourself, Meredith.

737
00:41:31,187 --> 00:41:34,370
DENNY : But they're the only way to
find out who you really are.

738
00:41:35,998 --> 00:41:39,512
DENNY : I know who I am now.
I know what I want.

739
00:41:40,795 --> 00:41:44,213
DENNY : I've got the love of my life...
a new heart...

740
00:41:45,386 --> 00:41:49,530
DENNY : and I want you guys to get on the
next plane out here, and meet my girl.

741
00:41:53,887 --> 00:41:55,603
DENNY : Everything's gonna be different now.

742
00:41:58,248 --> 00:42:00,521
DENNY : I promise, from here on now,

743
00:42:01,925 --> 00:42:03,081
DENNY : nothing's ever gonna be the same.

744
00:42:04,957 --> 00:42:06,603
DENNY : I love you. Bye.

745
