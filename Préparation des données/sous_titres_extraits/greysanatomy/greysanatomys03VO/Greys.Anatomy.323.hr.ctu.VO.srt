1
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:10,505
I just never thought about it.

2
00:00:11,153 --> 00:00:13,820
What I would do, you know?
What the dream would be if I...

3
00:00:14,528 --> 00:00:15,927
couldn't have my dream.

4
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:18,312
Empty office.

5
00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:21,179
What are we doing?
Thought we were gonna lunch.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,331
Why are we still sitting here?

7
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,266
We're doing what I do
when I get depressed.

8
00:00:24,454 --> 00:00:26,370
Just wait.
What time do you have?

9
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,799
It's 5 to 1:00.

10
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,671
You know what? I'm glad
I can't have a child.

11
00:00:31,056 --> 00:00:33,131
With my luck, I'd probably
have a kid with two heads.

12
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,719
It... It's actually better.
I'm grateful.

13
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:37,722
I don't have to think about it.
The option is...

14
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,949
off the table.

15
00:00:41,019 --> 00:00:42,681
- What time do you have?
- 5 to 1:00.

16
00:00:42,783 --> 00:00:44,511
You people are obsessed with time.

17
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:50,138
Here he comes.

18
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,588
Hi, Dell.

19
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,940
Have a nice... surf.

20
00:01:46,178 --> 00:01:47,586
I'll see you guys after lunch?

21
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:01,755
You two should be
ashamed of yourselves.

22
00:02:01,793 --> 00:02:03,425
Admit it.
You feel better.

23
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:06,338
And if not,
there's another showing in an hour,

24
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,752
and it's wet.

25
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,489
My brain is bleeding?

26
00:02:13,644 --> 00:02:15,789
How could my brain have been
bleeding since the accident?

27
00:02:15,816 --> 00:02:16,905
Well, it could be
from the trauma,

28
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:18,883
but it also could be
from one of your surgeries.

29
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:22,082
Dr. Shepherd, I've been living
in this hospital long enough to know

30
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:24,054
when there's something
one of you isn't saying.

31
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:26,815
Because of the location of the bleed,

32
00:02:27,259 --> 00:02:28,763
you need to be awake
during surgery.

33
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,203
You'll be sedate alert,

34
00:02:30,218 --> 00:02:32,387
but it can be
a really dangerous process.

35
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:33,883
There's a lot about the brain
we don't know.

36
00:02:33,902 --> 00:02:34,963
So...

37
00:02:35,592 --> 00:02:38,334
I could potentially
get my memory back?

38
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:39,594
Mm. It's possible.

39
00:02:39,666 --> 00:02:42,033
Amnesia can be a symptom,
but I think it's a long shot.

40
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,930
I'll do some brain mapping
and see if anything happens,

41
00:02:43,949 --> 00:02:46,343
- but...
- But I could get my memory back?

42
00:02:48,411 --> 00:02:49,848
You're back? What happened?

43
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:51,284
She's got a fever,

44
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:54,430
- and I think I hear a small murmur.
- A heart murmur?

45
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:55,697
Don't be dramatic.

46
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:57,678
At least it's not the hiccups.

47
00:02:57,697 --> 00:02:59,509
Could be complications
from the endoscopy.

48
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:00,911
Bacterial endocarditis?

49
00:03:00,948 --> 00:03:03,543
You'll have to get tests,
and if they come back positive,

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,230
you'll be admitted
for I.V. antibiotics.

51
00:03:05,259 --> 00:03:06,630
Which should knock it right out.

52
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:09,413
See? I told you.
Don't be dramatic.

53
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:17,508
Hey, hey.
You're supposed to wait for me.

54
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:19,951
I'm going crazy
just sitting there.

55
00:03:20,262 --> 00:03:21,708
Hey, look, I'd be freaked out, too,

56
00:03:21,721 --> 00:03:23,353
if somebody was about to
open up my head.

57
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:25,113
But Dr. Shepherd, he's the best.

58
00:03:25,168 --> 00:03:27,111
I can't hold my baby, right?

59
00:03:27,132 --> 00:03:29,151
She's...
She's in that incubator.

60
00:03:29,705 --> 00:03:32,644
And so the nurses told me
to talk to her. And I try.

61
00:03:33,762 --> 00:03:36,166
Guess what.
Right now, I have nothing to say.

62
00:03:36,376 --> 00:03:39,559
You know, I don't even remember
what it feels like to be outside,

63
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,070
to have the wind on my face
or rain or...

64
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:44,476
I know
the surgery is dangerous, but...

65
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,850
I'm not freaked.

66
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:48,259
- I can't wait.
- Well, there's no guarantee

67
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,065
the surgery's gonna
bring back your memory.

68
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:51,497
But there's a chance.

69
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:53,328
It's better than nothing.

70
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:58,308
Good news.
Uh, Paul's lack of sex drive

71
00:03:58,393 --> 00:04:00,764
comes from a hormone imbalance.

72
00:04:00,855 --> 00:04:02,329
So Paul still likes sex?

73
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:05,298
Yeah, well, he's a guy and
he's not dead, so I'm guessing yeah.

74
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:07,138
He... He just can't
do anything about it.

75
00:04:07,252 --> 00:04:08,845
- And that's good news?
- The bad news is that

76
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:10,040
there could be many causes

77
00:04:10,059 --> 00:04:13,105
to this imbalance,
some more serious than others.

78
00:04:13,627 --> 00:04:16,829
So final diagnosis and treatment
could be a lengthy process.

79
00:04:16,941 --> 00:04:18,274
We're gonna have to run
more tests.

80
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:19,311
So it might be a while

81
00:04:19,328 --> 00:04:22,774
before Paul can help Kathy...
take the edge off.

82
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:25,678
Tell her to try swimming.
It's easier on the knees.

83
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:30,984
So...

84
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:32,940
you're the quack.

85
00:04:33,265 --> 00:04:34,617
Uh, I went to med school.

86
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:36,414
I'm also a licensed herbalist,

87
00:04:36,424 --> 00:04:37,993
and I spent five years in China

88
00:04:38,096 --> 00:04:39,514
learning alternative medicine.

89
00:04:40,084 --> 00:04:42,282
Like I said... quack.

90
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:45,032
Come here.

91
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,888
Unless you need to go
tell someone

92
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:48,591
you saw goody Johnson
with the devil.

93
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,184
Okay.

94
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,287
- Lie down on the table.
- Why?

95
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:56,433
I wanna show you
that I'm not a quack.

96
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:02,197
I'm not taking my clothes off.

97
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:04,713
Did I ask you
to take your clothes off?

98
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,993
Now...

99
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,850
You carry a lot of tension in your
shoulders  and above your right eye.

100
00:05:27,235 --> 00:05:28,531
What do you mean?

101
00:05:28,867 --> 00:05:30,745
You're blocking
some serious emotion.

102
00:05:31,809 --> 00:05:32,814
Hang on.

103
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:34,928
What... What are you doing?

104
00:05:45,293 --> 00:05:47,781
Stop saying "Ow."
It doesn't hurt.

105
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:52,056
- Okay, I'm done.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

106
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:53,925
Where you going?
You can't leave me here like this.

107
00:05:53,953 --> 00:05:56,137
Lie there. Don't move.
Breathe.

108
00:05:56,276 --> 00:05:58,342
You're going to experience
a rush of emotion,

109
00:05:58,454 --> 00:06:00,614
a release of... psychic pain.

110
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:12,134
Hello?

111
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,299
Hello?

112
00:06:15,905 --> 00:06:17,322
I don't feel anything...

113
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,895
Except stupid for...

114
00:06:20,277 --> 00:06:22,990
letting a cute hippie boy
put needles in my face.

115
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:24,889
Hello!

116
00:06:26,284 --> 00:06:27,713
Yeah, Pete...

117
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,965
This isn't working.

118
00:06:30,987 --> 00:06:32,537
I don't have any...

119
00:06:33,147 --> 00:06:34,217
psychic pain.

120
00:06:34,246 --> 00:06:36,012
I... I'm great.

121
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:38,517
Barren, but...

122
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,920
fan-freakin'-tastic.

123
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,328
You can come back now.

124
00:06:44,346 --> 00:06:47,888
I am not feeling any, you know,
rush of emotion or anything.

125
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,702
I don't feel... anything.

126
00:06:57,147 --> 00:06:58,828
I don't feel anything at all.

127
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:06,283
I don't feel anything at all.

128
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:14,547
I hate L.A.

129
00:07:18,923 --> 00:07:20,970
I heard Susan was back.
Is everything okay?

130
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:22,593
Oh, an infection.
She'll be fine.

131
00:07:22,615 --> 00:07:24,545
Oh, good, 'cause I figured
if anything was wrong,

132
00:07:24,555 --> 00:07:26,301
- you'd tell me.
- If it was serious, I would,

133
00:07:26,323 --> 00:07:28,032
in a very "letting you in"
sort of way.

134
00:07:28,689 --> 00:07:30,163
- You know, it's weird.
- What?

135
00:07:30,332 --> 00:07:32,464
My father...
we're almost talking.

136
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,683
Really?

137
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:37,439
- How's the trailer?
- It's freezing.

138
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:40,881
You want to eat later?
I'll bring something over.

139
00:07:41,157 --> 00:07:43,524
- Are you using me for central heating?
- Among other things.

140
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:45,029
- Okay.
- All right.

141
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:50,484
Lisa?

142
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:52,634
- I think something is wrong.
- She's in pain.

143
00:07:53,084 --> 00:07:55,321
- Lisa?
- Addison, something is not right.

144
00:07:55,415 --> 00:07:58,206
- My god. I think I just wet my pants.
- No, your water broke.

145
00:07:58,211 --> 00:08:00,286
- She's in labor, and it's coming fast.
- I'll call an ambulance.

146
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:01,397
Uh, go get Cooper.

147
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:03,707
And let the hospital know
we're coming and call the chief.

148
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,432
I don't want any problems
when I try to scrub in.

149
00:08:07,307 --> 00:08:09,119
- I need to push!
- Don't push.

150
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:10,603
Get her into labor
and delivery right away.

151
00:08:10,621 --> 00:08:11,767
Jim, check her in.

152
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:17,205
Is she okay?
Are they okay?

153
00:08:17,219 --> 00:08:18,439
- What happened?
- It's too early.

154
00:08:18,451 --> 00:08:20,188
- She's not due for another month.
- Well, I'm guessing

155
00:08:20,198 --> 00:08:22,134
that the stress of you all
fighting and crowding her,

156
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:23,919
declaring yourselves the father
didn't help.

157
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:25,172
Move!

158
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:35,919
Any word on Lisa and the baby?

159
00:08:37,486 --> 00:08:38,594
We're still waiting.

160
00:08:40,495 --> 00:08:42,402
- Therapy sucks.
- Said the shrink.

161
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:44,464
No, I mean my particular
brand of therapy

162
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,285
might actually be...
full of crap.

163
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:50,259
People talking about
their problems endlessly,

164
00:08:50,286 --> 00:08:52,286
telling people
to think positively,

165
00:08:52,302 --> 00:08:54,518
- visualize their destiny.
- It doesn't work?

166
00:08:54,588 --> 00:08:57,085
I think positively.
I visualize my destiny.

167
00:08:58,478 --> 00:09:00,187
And look, just look.

168
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:02,751
What am I lookin' at?

169
00:09:02,915 --> 00:09:03,920
Me...

170
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:07,506
My pathetic, miserable existence.

171
00:09:08,771 --> 00:09:10,172
He left six months ago.

172
00:09:10,247 --> 00:09:11,684
He was a loser!

173
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,948
Do you know he peed a little bit
every time he coughed?

174
00:09:16,005 --> 00:09:17,724
Like an incontinent old woman.

175
00:09:17,768 --> 00:09:19,026
He smelled like pee.

176
00:09:20,016 --> 00:09:22,110
And there I was,
in the car, crying,

177
00:09:22,683 --> 00:09:24,016
and I'm a serious feminist.

178
00:09:24,681 --> 00:09:26,380
Not to mention, my no-sex couple?

179
00:09:26,771 --> 00:09:28,856
Turns out it was a hormone thing.
It's physical.

180
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:31,560
In the old days we would've
talked and talked and talked

181
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:33,310
as Paul got sicker and sicker.

182
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,959
My profession's becoming irrelevant.

183
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:39,980
Maybe it's a good thing.

184
00:09:40,017 --> 00:09:42,627
People should just tell the truth
to the people in their lives.

185
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:43,788
They can't.

186
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,092
- If they could, we'd all be healthy.
- Like me.

187
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,529
You're not healthy.
You're in denial.

188
00:09:47,542 --> 00:09:48,650
I am not in denial.

189
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:50,616
You're in denial,
and you're angry.

190
00:09:50,626 --> 00:09:52,091
You're the angriest man I know.

191
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,424
Is that why you won't sleep
with me?

192
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:55,419
You're in denial, you're angry,

193
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,661
and you use sex
as weapon to deflect it.

194
00:10:01,546 --> 00:10:03,734
Now stimulating area 11.

195
00:10:04,855 --> 00:10:06,386
Ava, can you name this object?

196
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:08,418
Flowers, pink and blue.

197
00:10:08,674 --> 00:10:10,853
Avoiding area 11.
Moving superiorly.

198
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:12,907
This will be area 12.

199
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:18,158
<i>Una cara con los ojos azules
y el pelo rubio.</i>

200
00:10:19,876 --> 00:10:21,996
- Was that spanish?
- Was it?

201
00:10:22,118 --> 00:10:23,601
Okay, I'm going on to 13.

202
00:10:24,444 --> 00:10:26,839
<i>Une maison avec des galets rouges.</i>

203
00:10:28,382 --> 00:10:30,039
All right.
Now you're just showing off.

204
00:10:30,106 --> 00:10:31,918
Each language is stored in
a different area of the brain.

205
00:10:31,937 --> 00:10:34,285
And as I stimulate them...
this will be 14.

206
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,485
So this isn't from the surgery?

207
00:10:35,504 --> 00:10:36,821
She actually speaks
spanish and french?

208
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:40,157
Alex... <i>ich möchte die nächste
Karte, das ist noch das Haus</i>

209
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:41,287
And german?

210
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:43,606
She's hypoventilating. Let's put
her under and work on the bleed.

211
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:45,123
Can't we keep going
just a few more minutes?

212
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,880
Maybe she can get her memory
back along with the languages.

213
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,382
If we don't control this bleed
she'll lose a lot more

214
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:49,771
than her memory she'll die.

215
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:55,465
- Why is this happening so fast?
- Uh, doctors?

216
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:57,317
Cooper, she's crowning.

217
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:59,914
- All right, just don't push, Lisa.
- Oh, push? Okay.

218
00:10:59,934 --> 00:11:01,615
No! No, don't push, Lisa.

219
00:11:01,624 --> 00:11:02,891
The cord's wrapped
around the baby's neck.

220
00:11:02,913 --> 00:11:04,758
Oh, I'm sorry!
I can't help it!

221
00:11:05,272 --> 00:11:06,831
God! Oh!

222
00:11:10,991 --> 00:11:12,377
I'll hold her.
You clamp and cut.

223
00:11:12,396 --> 00:11:13,776
- Okay.
- Is she okay?

224
00:11:13,907 --> 00:11:15,466
Hang 20 of oxytocin.

225
00:11:17,183 --> 00:11:18,770
8 french suction catheter.

226
00:11:19,995 --> 00:11:22,810
- Why isn't she crying?
- Cooper's gonna be working on her.

227
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,707
We need to focus
on your right now, Lisa.

228
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,289
Fortunately,
you're not bleeding that much,

229
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:29,001
so we should be able to
remove the placenta by...

230
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:34,132
By... By what? By what?

231
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:35,782
- Put her under, now.
- What's going on?

232
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:38,460
Her uterus must have ruptured
because of the placenta accreta.

233
00:11:38,478 --> 00:11:40,403
- We have to open her up.
- No, no, no, no, no.

234
00:11:40,413 --> 00:11:42,289
- The baby's not crying.
- B.P.'s 58 over 32.

235
00:11:42,308 --> 00:11:43,815
Don't put me under
till the baby cries.

236
00:11:43,844 --> 00:11:46,350
We don't have time, Lisa.
We have to put you under right now.

237
00:11:50,737 --> 00:11:51,976
Go, Addison.

238
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,774
Hang two units
of B-positive and make sure

239
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:57,465
we have plenty on standby.
She's gonna exsanguinate

240
00:11:57,484 --> 00:11:59,012
if we don't move quickly,
people. 10-blade.

241
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,836
Lisa lost a lot of blood.

242
00:12:07,072 --> 00:12:09,165
We had to put the baby
on oxygen but...

243
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:10,625
they are both stable.

244
00:12:10,657 --> 00:12:12,735
- Who's the father?
- What?

245
00:12:12,819 --> 00:12:14,661
You said you sent off
for the paternity test.

246
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:17,408
- Which one of us is the father?
- Did Lisa say anything,

247
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,938
her decision about the baby?

248
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:23,186
Lisa lost a lot of blood,

249
00:12:23,231 --> 00:12:27,168
we had to put the baby on oxygen,
but they are both stable.

250
00:12:27,187 --> 00:12:29,488
I say it again
because it seems like

251
00:12:29,522 --> 00:12:31,400
you didn't hear me
the first time.

252
00:12:31,492 --> 00:12:34,375
They almost died.
Lisa... almost died.

253
00:12:34,477 --> 00:12:35,792
And so I didn't have time,

254
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:38,677
what, with, um,
trying to save her life,

255
00:12:38,863 --> 00:12:41,258
to pause and check on
the paternity test

256
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,255
or ask her about the baby's future.

257
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:45,051
What is wrong with you people?

258
00:12:46,108 --> 00:12:47,948
Can... Can we see the baby?

259
00:12:48,007 --> 00:12:51,922
No. None of you go near Lisa
or the baby until I say so.

260
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:54,609
The child is not a possession
that you fight over.

261
00:12:56,539 --> 00:12:58,257
And by the way, not that you asked,

262
00:12:58,487 --> 00:13:01,126
it's a girl...
6 pounds, 9 ounces.

263
00:13:20,123 --> 00:13:21,156
I don't remember.

264
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,806
We got it, the bleed.

265
00:13:25,196 --> 00:13:26,463
You're gonna be fine.

266
00:13:26,788 --> 00:13:28,609
By the way, uh,
you rocked that surgery.

267
00:13:28,619 --> 00:13:29,961
You spoke three languages.

268
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:32,890
I don't remember anything.

269
00:13:35,804 --> 00:13:37,213
The surgery was sup...

270
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:41,573
I th... I thought I would...

271
00:13:44,326 --> 00:13:45,716
What am I gonna do?

272
00:13:46,215 --> 00:13:49,097
What if...
What if I never remember anything?

273
00:13:58,206 --> 00:13:59,332
You sick, O'Malley?

274
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:02,338
You feel fine.

275
00:14:02,515 --> 00:14:04,309
Take an aspirin
and get off my clean bed.

276
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:08,076
You been married a long time, right?

277
00:14:08,438 --> 00:14:10,039
O'malley, I do not have time

278
00:14:10,076 --> 00:14:11,870
- to answer...
- Did you have doubts...

279
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,043
about your marriage?

280
00:14:14,132 --> 00:14:15,925
I don't mean, uh, insecurities.

281
00:14:16,184 --> 00:14:18,832
- I mean really serious doubts.
- Dr. Bailey I need you to sign this

282
00:14:18,851 --> 00:14:20,203
before I can discharge bed ten.

283
00:14:20,222 --> 00:14:23,575
No. He's supposed to get
an I.V. dose before discharge.

284
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:25,096
Why don't people listen?

285
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,593
Someday you'll have
to explain to me

286
00:14:32,614 --> 00:14:34,180
how antibiotics actually work.

287
00:14:34,286 --> 00:14:35,844
They are miraculous.

288
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:37,211
Good afternoon.

289
00:14:37,307 --> 00:14:38,912
Dr. Bailey asked me to look in.

290
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,453
Everything looks good.

291
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:43,849
We are going to take you
to radiology to get a central line

292
00:14:43,906 --> 00:14:46,631
to continue your
I.V. antibiotics outpatient.

293
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,121
Hey, will you show
your dad the cafeteria?

294
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:54,871
Sure. We're on to you, you know?

295
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:56,317
What?

296
00:15:02,616 --> 00:15:03,667
Dr. Bailey.

297
00:15:03,881 --> 00:15:07,130
I was... Looking for some privacy,
and, uh...

298
00:15:07,805 --> 00:15:10,256
I didn't think anyone would come
looking for me down here.

299
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:12,716
- I apologize.
- Problem. Take your time.

300
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,649
Uh, Dr. Bailey.

301
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,221
Yeah.

302
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:18,352
Um, you've been married

303
00:15:18,662 --> 00:15:20,056
a long time now, right?

304
00:15:20,164 --> 00:15:22,558
Do you think it matters
if one person...

305
00:15:24,118 --> 00:15:25,743
Is... Is more ready?

306
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:27,191
O'Malley!

307
00:15:29,948 --> 00:15:31,288
Come here.

308
00:15:34,313 --> 00:15:35,325
Yes. Hi, Dr. Burke.

309
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:37,819
I want the two of you
to talk to each other.

310
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,673
I want you to talk to each other
and leave my marriage out of it.

311
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:42,873
I also want you to leave
my clinic out of it.

312
00:15:42,958 --> 00:15:44,697
And by that, I mean get out.

313
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,025
I need the space, I need the peace,
I need the quiet, and I need it now.

314
00:15:48,043 --> 00:15:49,649
- Sorry.
- Yeah, right, sorry.

315
00:15:56,139 --> 00:15:57,952
Cooper, you're blocking the caffeine.

316
00:15:59,972 --> 00:16:01,287
He's blocking the caffeine.

317
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:03,895
Cooper, if you move,
I'll give you a cookie.

318
00:16:04,153 --> 00:16:06,064
Hey, did something go wrong
with Lisa's surgery?

319
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:07,272
No, uh, we handled it.

320
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:09,501
Addison...
She is, uh, pretty excellent.

321
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,585
She's pretty excellent.

322
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:16,351
Okay, only because
you've sighed twice...

323
00:16:17,112 --> 00:16:18,238
What's the matter, Cooper?

324
00:16:22,549 --> 00:16:24,747
I don't go to hookers.
I don't go to strip clubs.

325
00:16:24,902 --> 00:16:27,456
I meet women on the Internet
that want to meet me.

326
00:16:27,727 --> 00:16:30,731
So I like 'em a little younger
and a little dirtier.

327
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:32,220
Is that wrong?

328
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:37,972
- It's wrong?
- You need to meet a grown-up.

329
00:16:37,996 --> 00:16:39,456
You need to date
someone your own age.

330
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:41,885
Someone without
a porny internet name

331
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,328
and perhaps no criminal past.

332
00:16:43,341 --> 00:16:44,795
- A nice girl.
- A viable girl.

333
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,505
Someone with whom you can
have a relationship.

334
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,909
You're a respected doctor.

335
00:16:47,919 --> 00:16:50,675
Go out in the real world,
meet a woman your own age

336
00:16:50,694 --> 00:16:53,671
- and ask her out.
- Be a man, Cooper.

337
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:55,667
Be a man.

338
00:17:07,187 --> 00:17:08,286
There you are.

339
00:17:08,973 --> 00:17:11,452
I just stopped by to see how
Lisa and the baby are doing.

340
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:17,840
- You okay?
- Yeah. I just... I...

341
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:21,019
I had a little
too much surgery today.

342
00:17:21,028 --> 00:17:22,192
But I'm... I'm good.

343
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:26,809
- You look good.
- Yeah.

344
00:17:27,775 --> 00:17:29,944
You look... beautiful.

345
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,616
Sam told me that
I had to stay away from you

346
00:17:34,634 --> 00:17:36,729
- because you're Naomi's friend, but...
- Stop it.

347
00:17:36,845 --> 00:17:38,169
- What?
- You're flirting.

348
00:17:38,289 --> 00:17:40,458
- What's wrong with flirting?
- What's wrong with it?

349
00:17:40,523 --> 00:17:41,771
What's wrong?

350
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,963
What's wrong is
that I don't have time for it.

351
00:17:45,042 --> 00:17:47,856
I am... out of time.
I missed my chance.

352
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,760
And now I have two eggs left.

353
00:17:50,263 --> 00:17:52,320
I might as well have no eggs left.

354
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:53,955
I am egg-less.

355
00:17:54,401 --> 00:17:55,917
Naomi says that she's dried up?

356
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:59,137
I'm the one who's dried up.
I'm all barren and dried up.

357
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:01,650
And I have clearly
been wasting my time on men.

358
00:18:01,665 --> 00:18:03,646
I mean,
I might as well take up hobbies,

359
00:18:03,937 --> 00:18:05,317
like needlepoint,

360
00:18:05,337 --> 00:18:08,370
or, um, collecting those little
ceramic dolls, you know?

361
00:18:08,377 --> 00:18:10,274
Because that's
what dried up women do.

362
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:11,539
They do needlepoint.

363
00:18:11,688 --> 00:18:14,812
They do not waste their time
flirting with men

364
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,230
who clearly just want to get laid.

365
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,070
They do not waste their time...

366
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:22,374
telling overly personal...

367
00:18:23,573 --> 00:18:26,767
information about their eggs
to total strangers.

368
00:18:26,777 --> 00:18:28,091
Oh, my god. I'm sorry.

369
00:18:29,756 --> 00:18:31,137
What are you doing?

370
00:18:32,891 --> 00:18:34,036
I'm gonna kiss you.

371
00:18:34,654 --> 00:18:36,043
I'm gonna kiss you with tongue.

372
00:18:37,642 --> 00:18:39,379
I'm gonna kiss you
so you feel it.

373
00:18:40,759 --> 00:18:41,820
Okay?

374
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,128
Okay.

375
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:15,423
Why'd you do that?

376
00:19:16,734 --> 00:19:17,917
To remind you...

377
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:20,293
that you're not dried up.

378
00:19:23,744 --> 00:19:25,547
If you need me
to remind you again...

379
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,675
let me know.

380
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:43,385
When do the cramping start?

381
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,973
- A little while ago.
- What is it?

382
00:19:44,992 --> 00:19:46,598
- Is it...
- Probably nothing serious.

383
00:19:46,607 --> 00:19:48,531
It could just be a reaction
to the antibiotics.

384
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,924
We may have to switch
to another one,

385
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,877
but it may mean
another night here.

386
00:19:52,846 --> 00:19:54,330
It's okay, it's okay.

387
00:19:54,981 --> 00:19:56,005
It's okay.

388
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:04,299
Wait.

389
00:20:05,075 --> 00:20:07,141
I know...
I know that you think we're awful,

390
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:09,337
and I think that we're awful.

391
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:10,652
I just, um...

392
00:20:12,323 --> 00:20:14,145
I just wanted a baby so badly.

393
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:15,976
I just wanted a baby.

394
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,060
And I don't care
who the father is,

395
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,534
I don't care if the baby's mine.

396
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:23,022
All that matters is the baby.
Is... Is she gonna be okay?

397
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,104
Just tell me that
she's gonna be okay.

398
00:20:30,513 --> 00:20:31,743
She's gonna be okay.

399
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,024
Thank you.

400
00:20:36,901 --> 00:20:38,103
You're welcome.

401
00:20:45,849 --> 00:20:47,590
I hear Callie's going to be
a bridesmaid.

402
00:20:47,618 --> 00:20:48,669
Yeah.

403
00:20:51,705 --> 00:20:54,262
Would you, um, say that
you were the one

404
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:57,034
that needed more urging
to get married?

405
00:20:57,061 --> 00:20:58,263
Oh, I hadn't...

406
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,751
Really been thinking about it.
I...

407
00:21:01,227 --> 00:21:03,885
It just, uh, seemed like
a good idea at the time.

408
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:08,160
You and Cristina have been
together for a while.

409
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,315
You got married pretty fast.

410
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,680
So in theory it's better
to know someone pretty well.

411
00:21:11,709 --> 00:21:14,385
- Way better than...
- Still, no guarantees.

412
00:21:16,351 --> 00:21:17,581
I-I don't...

413
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:20,737
- believe in divorce.
- Neither do I.

414
00:21:23,842 --> 00:21:24,950
Is it possible...

415
00:21:25,586 --> 00:21:28,525
do you think,
to love two people...

416
00:21:31,144 --> 00:21:32,249
at the same time?

417
00:21:33,425 --> 00:21:34,495
I, uh...

418
00:21:36,103 --> 00:21:38,526
I'm still hoping it's possible
just to love one person.

419
00:21:42,741 --> 00:21:44,901
So, uh, it's not gonna be
too weird, right?

420
00:21:45,021 --> 00:21:46,812
- Me as a bridesmaid?
- No, no, it's fine.

421
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:48,675
- 'Cause I can tell Cristina...
- I said it's fine.

422
00:21:48,702 --> 00:21:49,932
Really, no worries.

423
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:51,472
So, um...

424
00:21:51,993 --> 00:21:54,523
Did George tell you he's thinking
about transferring to Mercy West?

425
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:56,702
Yeah. Sounds like a good idea.

426
00:21:58,557 --> 00:22:01,055
- So we're fine?
- Oh, we are. Fine.

427
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:06,172
Hey, that last dress
was okay, wasn't it?

428
00:22:06,339 --> 00:22:09,325
I mean, it was too tight
and I couldn't breathe, but...

429
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:12,062
- A wedding's just one day, right?
- Yeah.

430
00:22:18,764 --> 00:22:20,589
We got Paul's M.R.I. back,

431
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,564
and I've consulted with
Dr. Straley at Sloan-Kettering.

432
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:26,622
We found a tumor
on your adrenal gland.

433
00:22:26,688 --> 00:22:28,585
All right? Is its right
on top of the kidney,

434
00:22:28,612 --> 00:22:30,744
and it's what's been causing
your low sex drive.

435
00:22:32,418 --> 00:22:34,399
So it wasn't me?
He's got a condition.

436
00:22:35,294 --> 00:22:38,121
A tumor, that's not too...

437
00:22:38,867 --> 00:22:40,201
You can treat that, right?

438
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:44,552
These tumors are usually
aggressive and found late

439
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,627
because the symptoms
are so subtle.

440
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,654
What does that mean?

441
00:22:48,836 --> 00:22:50,780
Treatment is difficult and risky,

442
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:52,921
but there is hope.

443
00:22:54,246 --> 00:22:56,912
Oh, my god, honey,
I can't believe I yelled at you.

444
00:22:57,175 --> 00:22:58,424
I'm so sorry.

445
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:00,681
It's all right, honey.
It's okay.

446
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,817
No, I'm horrible.
I'm so sorry.

447
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:04,376
I love you so much.

448
00:23:24,056 --> 00:23:25,286
Hello?

449
00:23:28,076 --> 00:23:29,288
Hello?

450
00:23:32,259 --> 00:23:33,827
Are you there...

451
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:36,465
elevator god?

452
00:23:37,514 --> 00:23:38,950
It's me, Addison.

453
00:23:40,415 --> 00:23:41,495
<i>What?</i>

454
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:42,880
Hi.

455
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:44,221
<i>Hi.</i>

456
00:23:44,726 --> 00:23:47,590
Okay, look, you may be
a figment of my imagination,

457
00:23:47,623 --> 00:23:49,764
or maybe I'm going
completely insane,

458
00:23:50,618 --> 00:23:52,365
I don't know. Or maybe...

459
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:54,908
this is payback for my crimes

460
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:57,119
on some ginormous karmic level,
I don't know.

461
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,422
I just...

462
00:23:59,567 --> 00:24:03,267
I just want to tell you
I'm sorry for yelling at you.

463
00:24:06,392 --> 00:24:07,397
Okay?

464
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:09,996
<i>Okay.</i>

465
00:24:14,712 --> 00:24:15,755
Well...

466
00:24:16,834 --> 00:24:17,942
bye.

467
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,536
I am such a screwup...

468
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:25,882
in my life.

469
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:29,883
Up until now, I have been
really great at one thing.

470
00:24:30,826 --> 00:24:32,901
I am great...

471
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,980
at being Paul's wife.

472
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,220
And I thought
he didn't want me anymore.

473
00:24:37,235 --> 00:24:40,456
I thought... I was sure that he was
in love with somebody else.

474
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:41,692
Of course you were.

475
00:24:42,921 --> 00:24:44,025
I lied to Paul.

476
00:24:46,971 --> 00:24:48,320
I was with a man

477
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:50,549
that night that I didn't come home.

478
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,953
I didn't even find him
that attractive.

479
00:24:54,976 --> 00:24:55,990
I just told myself

480
00:24:56,009 --> 00:24:58,383
that I wasn't gonna settle
for being alone, you know?

481
00:24:59,396 --> 00:25:02,391
Kathy, you were reacting
to what was in front of you.

482
00:25:03,215 --> 00:25:05,994
There was no way you could
know what was really going on.

483
00:25:06,085 --> 00:25:08,009
What do I do now?

484
00:25:16,451 --> 00:25:18,432
You do what you're great at.

485
00:25:19,816 --> 00:25:21,149
You love your husband.

486
00:25:28,261 --> 00:25:30,280
You're gonna have to
tell me that a lot, okay?

487
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:32,871
Okay.

488
00:25:37,883 --> 00:25:39,789
Hey, everyone else is gone.
I was heading out.

489
00:25:41,015 --> 00:25:44,386
Uh, unless... I was gonna get
some food. You want something?

490
00:25:47,518 --> 00:25:49,086
I... I ate.

491
00:25:49,491 --> 00:25:50,505
Thanks for asking.

492
00:25:52,881 --> 00:25:53,973
Another night?

493
00:25:55,876 --> 00:25:57,782
- Are you...
- Asking you out on a date? Yes.

494
00:25:57,810 --> 00:25:59,368
You can't ask me out.

495
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:00,698
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

496
00:26:00,717 --> 00:26:01,886
I asked.

497
00:26:02,015 --> 00:26:04,175
You're... You're a fetus.

498
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,820
You could be my fetus.

499
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,903
Coo coo cachoo, Mrs. Robinson.

500
00:26:08,918 --> 00:26:11,387
You can't use "The Graduate"
as a defense.

501
00:26:11,479 --> 00:26:14,235
You can't use a movie made
before you were born as a defense.

502
00:26:14,264 --> 00:26:15,278
Go out with me.

503
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:18,738
I like you, and you like me.

504
00:26:24,581 --> 00:26:25,585
Dell.

505
00:26:29,048 --> 00:26:30,381
Never gonna happen.

506
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,749
I'm starting to think L.A.
is like New York, but with a beach.

507
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:49,338
Why do you think we moved here?

508
00:26:51,681 --> 00:26:52,742
Uh, Pete.

509
00:26:52,865 --> 00:26:54,752
Uh, isn't it time for you
to get some refills?

510
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:56,217
Thanks.

511
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,892
Okay, Pete is my friend,

512
00:27:05,136 --> 00:27:06,920
don't get me wrong, but...

513
00:27:06,948 --> 00:27:08,368
Why are you warning me
about him?

514
00:27:08,387 --> 00:27:10,744
What, is he like a serial killer?
Is he a felon?

515
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,075
Is he secretly
my ex-husband's best friend?

516
00:27:14,596 --> 00:27:16,299
His wife died eight years ago.

517
00:27:18,108 --> 00:27:20,388
- Now I feel shallow.
- No, it's just...

518
00:27:20,781 --> 00:27:22,669
He can't connect with women.

519
00:27:22,861 --> 00:27:23,927
He's a good man,

520
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,179
but if you want someone
who's gonna be there,

521
00:27:26,302 --> 00:27:27,982
then Pete's not that guy.

522
00:27:30,464 --> 00:27:32,178
- You ready?
- Yeah, good.

523
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:42,608
This is nice, huh?

524
00:27:44,209 --> 00:27:45,688
- It is.
- Yeah.

525
00:27:55,025 --> 00:27:56,110
- Oh, no.
- What?

526
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:57,695
- That's not nice.
- Oh, you s...

527
00:27:57,739 --> 00:27:59,739
Hold it, hold it, hold on.
You said, "Be a man."

528
00:27:59,758 --> 00:28:02,724
Cooper, I commend you.
You're making an effort.

529
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:05,451
But I'm... I'm...
But I'm your friend.

530
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,794
You can't be a man
with your friend.

531
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,343
- Isn't that settling?
- Kinda, yeah.

532
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:16,154
Yes.

533
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:17,342
- Okay.
- Settling.

534
00:28:17,368 --> 00:28:18,758
- Great.
- Thank you, yes.

535
00:28:18,786 --> 00:28:20,744
- But we're good?
- We're very good.

536
00:28:23,972 --> 00:28:25,118
Hey, ex-best friend.

537
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,519
- Hey, ex-husband.
- You are drunk.

538
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:30,257
Ten more minutes, and I start dancing,
and I require company.

539
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:37,938
I don't think I've ever
seen her drunk before.

540
00:28:39,809 --> 00:28:40,889
Sam...

541
00:28:44,761 --> 00:28:46,141
Did you cheat on her?

542
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:49,225
Over the years,
there have been temptations,

543
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,072
but, no... I didn't.

544
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:56,394
Was there a lot of fighting or...

545
00:28:57,169 --> 00:28:58,220
Hardly ever.

546
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:01,666
Honestly...

547
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:05,346
it was bad, what I did.

548
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:09,698
I have no good reason.

549
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:13,285
I woke up one day...

550
00:29:14,832 --> 00:29:16,691
and I couldn't do it anymore.

551
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:18,981
It wasn't even a choice.

552
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:22,978
I had a thought...

553
00:29:24,445 --> 00:29:25,704
Next thing you know...

554
00:29:26,977 --> 00:29:28,264
I'm burning it all down.

555
00:29:29,971 --> 00:29:30,976
I left her.

556
00:29:33,109 --> 00:29:34,170
I don't know why.

557
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:37,601
I don't know why.

558
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:40,731
What kind of a person does that?

559
00:29:41,074 --> 00:29:42,074
Hell if I know.

560
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,818
And I did it, too.

561
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:53,227
So I ran into Allan...

562
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,560
at Whole Foods.

563
00:29:54,686 --> 00:29:56,104
Wanna hear something funny?

564
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,430
He said he didn't believe in marriage,
that marriage wasn't for him.

565
00:30:00,823 --> 00:30:02,128
But I guess that was wrong,

566
00:30:02,287 --> 00:30:05,152
because it only took him
four months.

567
00:30:05,634 --> 00:30:08,422
Four months after we broke up,
he got married,

568
00:30:08,581 --> 00:30:10,845
to someone who can't be
more than 25 years old.

569
00:30:11,997 --> 00:30:13,189
Isn't that funny?

570
00:30:29,462 --> 00:30:30,692
It heads off rejection.

571
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,460
What?

572
00:30:34,287 --> 00:30:35,817
That's why I like the Internet.

573
00:30:36,494 --> 00:30:37,968
I can't stand the...

574
00:30:39,497 --> 00:30:41,374
It's horrible, being rejected.

575
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,208
It is.

576
00:30:56,331 --> 00:30:58,847
Preston, I thought you had
a late surgery.

577
00:31:04,334 --> 00:31:05,733
You know all that...

578
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:07,724
"I trust you" crap?

579
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:10,617
You've been pulling that on me
since I was this high.

580
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:12,006
Preston, language.

581
00:31:12,048 --> 00:31:13,118
No.

582
00:31:14,217 --> 00:31:18,766
"I trust you" is code for
"Learn from your mistakes."

583
00:31:18,959 --> 00:31:20,039
This is not a mistake.

584
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:21,663
I never said it was a mistake.

585
00:31:21,691 --> 00:31:24,625
Cristina never knows
what's good for her.

586
00:31:24,918 --> 00:31:26,543
- That's who she is.
- Preston...

587
00:31:26,562 --> 00:31:28,646
She hates change.

588
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:30,401
I lead. I have to.

589
00:31:31,031 --> 00:31:32,064
And then she's grateful.

590
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,609
That's how it was with dating,
with moving in.

591
00:31:34,922 --> 00:31:36,303
Then I'm pleased for you.

592
00:31:38,088 --> 00:31:40,504
Look, I am going to
make her happy, Mama.

593
00:31:40,824 --> 00:31:42,217
The wedding is a huge step,

594
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,203
and she's being a great sport.
You know why?

595
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,644
Because she will be
happy someday.

596
00:31:48,564 --> 00:31:50,198
If you are so sure...

597
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:53,279
why are you yelling at me?

598
00:32:01,644 --> 00:32:03,756
- What happened?
- She's septic.

599
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:05,081
The sooner
we can get her to an O.R.,

600
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,583
the sooner we can help her.
Let's move.

601
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:08,873
- Richard, what... happened?
- Extremely rare complication.

602
00:32:08,892 --> 00:32:10,795
Toxic megacolon with a perforation.

603
00:32:10,827 --> 00:32:12,186
Can you get your dad
out of this room?

604
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:13,664
This fast? How could...

605
00:32:13,693 --> 00:32:15,487
Sometimes it progresses this rapidly.

606
00:32:15,492 --> 00:32:17,698
Very rarely, but sometimes.
We booked an O.R.

607
00:32:17,742 --> 00:32:19,143
You're going into surgery
right now?

608
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:20,879
I didn't sign a consent form.

609
00:32:20,889 --> 00:32:22,691
She needs surgery right now,
Thatcher.

610
00:32:22,705 --> 00:32:24,999
Not tomorrow, not later today.
Right now.

611
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:26,179
- Thatcher.
- Honey, listen...

612
00:32:26,198 --> 00:32:27,822
We need you to stay back, okay?

613
00:32:36,808 --> 00:32:38,319
You're gonna be okay.
This happens.

614
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:39,577
You're gonna be okay.

615
00:32:40,278 --> 00:32:42,166
We're losing her pulse,
she's coding.

616
00:32:42,175 --> 00:32:43,879
Okay, let's go.
Let's move. Move.

617
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,862
She's okay, huh?

618
00:32:53,543 --> 00:32:54,966
I mean,
after all she went through,

619
00:32:54,975 --> 00:32:56,750
she still looks pretty awesome.

620
00:32:57,717 --> 00:32:58,731
Lisa,

621
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,975
we need to know what you want
to do with the baby.

622
00:33:01,407 --> 00:33:03,370
Carol...
she wants this so bad.

623
00:33:03,657 --> 00:33:05,215
This is about what you want.

624
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,497
- We did find out the paternity.
- No, no. I don't wanna know.

625
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:13,947
She's awesome, though.

626
00:33:15,979 --> 00:33:17,490
You don't have to decide right now.

627
00:33:17,632 --> 00:33:20,092
No. I know what I want to do.

628
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,447
Lisa gave the baby to Carol.

629
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,792
On the condition
they'd all be part of her life.

630
00:33:28,893 --> 00:33:31,440
So it turns out the baby
will have three dads anyway.

631
00:33:31,589 --> 00:33:32,755
And two moms.

632
00:33:32,875 --> 00:33:34,052
Lisa did a good thing.

633
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:35,438
They look happy.

634
00:33:38,186 --> 00:33:39,613
They look like a family.

635
00:34:08,596 --> 00:34:10,577
- Izzie, look...
- Look, I don't want you to go.

636
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,283
To Mercy West...
I don't want you...

637
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,398
It's not fair.

638
00:34:17,934 --> 00:34:19,324
I know we can't help
what happened,

639
00:34:19,343 --> 00:34:20,667
and I know that we didn't...

640
00:34:22,784 --> 00:34:24,634
I stood in that bridal shop
with your wife,

641
00:34:24,656 --> 00:34:26,609
and I smiled and I talked,
and I...

642
00:34:26,956 --> 00:34:28,130
felt like...

643
00:34:31,064 --> 00:34:32,181
That's not fair.

644
00:34:32,776 --> 00:34:34,312
I don't want you to go
to Mercy West

645
00:34:34,331 --> 00:34:37,307
because I'm losing my best friend,
and it's not fair.

646
00:34:40,018 --> 00:34:41,295
It's just not fair.

647
00:35:18,104 --> 00:35:19,203
We can't.

648
00:35:20,244 --> 00:35:21,342
I know.

649
00:35:24,827 --> 00:35:26,865
I was looking for you.
You ready to go?

650
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,397
A lot of folks would kill
for what you have, you know?

651
00:35:37,753 --> 00:35:38,992
A clean slate.

652
00:35:40,696 --> 00:35:42,837
So you don't remember?
So what?

653
00:35:44,207 --> 00:35:45,484
You'll make new memories.

654
00:35:46,382 --> 00:35:47,790
Oh, wow. Look at that.

655
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,233
It's so beautiful.

656
00:35:55,750 --> 00:35:57,327
How can you be so...

657
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:00,851
You're so good with me.

658
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,738
What's wrong with you
that you can't be is good

659
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,766
with someone
you have feelings for?

660
00:36:07,181 --> 00:36:09,547
What happened to you, Alex?

661
00:36:17,596 --> 00:36:20,211
Maybe I don't remember.
So what?

662
00:36:57,116 --> 00:37:00,393
We did everything...
we could.

663
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,102
You... You said
it was really simple

664
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:17,610
and that it was this...

665
00:37:18,423 --> 00:37:20,723
- small thing.
- It was.

666
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:22,973
She had the hiccups.

667
00:37:26,025 --> 00:37:27,095
She came here...

668
00:37:27,921 --> 00:37:29,480
because...
because she trusted you.

669
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:32,981
I trusted you.

670
00:37:35,517 --> 00:37:37,939
- Meredith, just stop. Okay, just stop.
- No, don't. Don't.

671
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:41,533
<i>At some point, maybe we accept</i>

672
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:43,665
<i>that the dream
has become a nightmare.</i>

673
00:37:45,862 --> 00:37:48,228
She had the hiccups.
Oh, god.

674
00:37:50,362 --> 00:37:51,714
The hiccups.

675
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:04,894
They've left. It's just us.

676
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,495
Oh, thank god.

677
00:38:19,586 --> 00:38:20,882
I got a dress.

678
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,711
You happy?

679
00:38:27,992 --> 00:38:29,053
Yeah.

680
00:38:29,819 --> 00:38:31,809
Are you... happy?

681
00:38:33,929 --> 00:38:34,945
Yeah.

682
00:38:39,679 --> 00:38:42,074
<i>We tell ourselves
the reality is better.</i>

683
00:38:47,649 --> 00:38:48,674
Limes!

684
00:38:48,935 --> 00:38:50,165
- Limes.
- Limes.

685
00:38:50,184 --> 00:38:52,096
So what are we
drinking to this time?

686
00:38:52,251 --> 00:38:54,861
Friends. Crappy friends.

687
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:57,215
Family. Crappy family.

688
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,241
Again?

689
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:05,461
- Again.
- Again.

690
00:39:07,811 --> 00:39:09,106
<i>Who wants another?</i>

691
00:39:21,969 --> 00:39:23,114
<i>We convince ourselves</i>

692
00:39:23,123 --> 00:39:25,030
<i>it's better
that we never dream at all.</i>

693
00:39:27,246 --> 00:39:28,683
<i>But the strongest of us,</i>

694
00:39:28,913 --> 00:39:30,660
<i>the most determined of us,</i>

695
00:39:31,045 --> 00:39:32,481
<i>we hold on to the dream.</i>

696
00:39:33,227 --> 00:39:34,542
You're ugly and old.

697
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:36,405
I'll miss you, too.

698
00:39:42,703 --> 00:39:44,215
There is an empty office.

699
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:46,572
Don't tempt me.

700
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,159
Think about it.

701
00:39:50,663 --> 00:39:54,635
<i>Or we find ourselves faced with
a fresh dream we never considered.</i>

702
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:58,675
Hold the door.

703
00:39:59,735 --> 00:40:01,679
<i>We awake to find ourselves...</i>

704
00:40:02,976 --> 00:40:04,451
<i>against all odds...</i>

705
00:40:06,437 --> 00:40:07,705
<i>feeling hopeful.</i>

706
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:09,917
This is gonna sound...

707
00:40:11,149 --> 00:40:13,192
When no one else is around,

708
00:40:14,484 --> 00:40:16,024
the elevator kind of, uh....

709
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,202
Talks to me.

710
00:40:20,797 --> 00:40:21,858
Hi, Tilly.

711
00:40:22,409 --> 00:40:23,714
<i>Hey, Pete.</i>

712
00:40:24,108 --> 00:40:25,113
That's Tilly.

713
00:40:25,441 --> 00:40:27,751
She works security.
The camera is right there.

714
00:40:35,464 --> 00:40:36,722
Hello, Tilly.

715
00:40:36,807 --> 00:40:39,004
<i>Hey, I get my kicks
wherever I can.</i>

716
00:40:41,595 --> 00:40:43,302
- You goin' home?
- Yeah...

717
00:40:44,477 --> 00:40:45,504
Home.

718
00:40:46,105 --> 00:40:47,345
You get what you came for?

719
00:40:48,672 --> 00:40:51,460
I honestly... don't know.

720
00:40:54,523 --> 00:40:55,988
Do you want me
to kiss you again?

721
00:40:58,495 --> 00:40:59,631
I think...

722
00:41:01,009 --> 00:41:02,157
not.

723
00:41:02,308 --> 00:41:04,073
Because of the evators
where you come from?

724
00:41:04,101 --> 00:41:06,477
Those horny,
aphrodisiac elevators?

725
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:09,869
Yeah, that, and, um...

726
00:41:10,059 --> 00:41:12,285
I'm not interested, so...

727
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:27,005
You're interested.

728
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,770
<i>And if we're lucky,
we realize...</i>

729
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,484
<i>in the face of everything,
in the face of life...</i>

730
00:41:42,037 --> 00:41:43,359
<i>The true dream...</i>

731
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:48,460
<i>is being able to dream at all.</i>
