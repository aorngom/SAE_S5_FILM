1
00:00:04,178 --> 00:00:05,342
<i>There's this person...</i>

2
00:00:07,253 --> 00:00:08,261
<i>In my head...</i>

3
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:11,037
<i>She's brilliant.</i>

4
00:00:11,503 --> 00:00:12,757
<i>Capable.</i>

5
00:00:12,877 --> 00:00:15,101
<i>She can do chest tubes
and craniatomies.</i>

6
00:00:15,261 --> 00:00:17,471
<i>She can run a code
without freaking out.</i>

7
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,285
<i>She's a really good surgeon.</i>

8
00:00:20,873 --> 00:00:22,478
<i>Maybe even a great surgeon.</i>

9
00:00:24,251 --> 00:00:25,307
<i>She's me...</i>

10
00:00:26,286 --> 00:00:27,822
<i>Only so much better.</i>

11
00:00:29,835 --> 00:00:31,242
This is good news.

12
00:00:31,612 --> 00:00:33,453
Reflects well on Seattle Grace.

13
00:00:34,959 --> 00:00:36,623
Is Yang gonna have a problem with it?

14
00:00:37,201 --> 00:00:38,124
I'd say so.

15
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:43,120
Every time Derek
walks into a room,

16
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,228
all I can think about
is his tongue...

17
00:00:45,658 --> 00:00:46,508
In my mouth.

18
00:00:46,668 --> 00:00:48,593
So you think about kissing Derek?

19
00:00:48,753 --> 00:00:50,679
It's making surgery
very difficult.

20
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:53,295
So I need some therapy tools
so that I can move on.

21
00:00:53,415 --> 00:00:54,856
You sure you want to move on?

22
00:00:54,976 --> 00:00:57,257
Well, we have our fifth
clinical trial patient today,

23
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:59,354
and the first four,
we've learned a lot,

24
00:00:59,514 --> 00:01:02,232
but we haven't saved one,
and I really want to save one.

25
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,118
So I can't be distracted
by things like tongues.

26
00:01:06,164 --> 00:01:08,345
So I need some tools, now.

27
00:01:08,465 --> 00:01:10,529
You're having fantasies
about Derek.

28
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:14,369
The only way to get rid of them
is to remind yourself of the reality.

29
00:01:17,216 --> 00:01:19,708
The kissing's not gonna happen now
because he's with Rose.

30
00:01:20,084 --> 00:01:22,074
Powerful stuff... reality.

31
00:01:26,282 --> 00:01:29,656
He's with Rose.
He's with Rose....

32
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:31,870
Sorry I'm late.

33
00:01:32,065 --> 00:01:33,930
- Just getting started.
- Hi, I'm Dr. Grey.

34
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,862
Jonathan evett. I've been treating
darren over at the V.A.

35
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:39,472
I'm so glad that you were able
to get him into the clinical trial.

36
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:42,583
So you're gonna inject
a virus into my son's brain.

37
00:01:42,765 --> 00:01:44,566
Not in the brain, dad.
In the tumor.

38
00:01:44,726 --> 00:01:47,318
The theory is that the virus

39
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:49,192
will attack the tumor and shrink it.

40
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,347
Still, there's an enormous
amount of risk involved.

41
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:52,528
That's okay.

42
00:01:53,192 --> 00:01:54,909
He survived
two tours in Afghanistan.

43
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:56,473
He's used to risk.

44
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:57,962
Sir.

45
00:01:58,415 --> 00:01:59,457
Mr. Covington.

46
00:02:01,534 --> 00:02:03,251
- Todd.
- Your dad called me.

47
00:02:03,928 --> 00:02:06,254
What'd you do,
call my whole platoon, dad?

48
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:09,466
Well, if you're gonna beat this,
you need your friends by your side.

49
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:15,655
Dr. Sloan.

50
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:18,031
Dr. Bailey.

51
00:02:18,717 --> 00:02:19,844
Dr. Bailey's baby.

52
00:02:19,964 --> 00:02:21,788
It appears nurse tanya

53
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:24,612
is no longer available
for your liposuction at 10:00.

54
00:02:25,111 --> 00:02:27,365
Shall I cancel the procedure?

55
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:29,736
Get me another nurse.
Get me kate.

56
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:39,038
Dr. Torres, Dr. Sloan would like
to use nurse kate this morning.

57
00:02:39,158 --> 00:02:41,915
Currently, she's scheduled
for your arthroplasty,

58
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,876
but if you're willing to move it back
an hour, perhaps she could do both.

59
00:02:49,536 --> 00:02:51,637
- Dr. Torres, I know you're in there.
- Yeah, fine.

60
00:02:51,757 --> 00:02:53,831
Just an hour later,
an hour earlier. Whatever.

61
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:55,022
Hey, tuck.

62
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,062
Don't judge me, bailey.

63
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:59,561
- Has cristina seen it?
- Let's take it down.

64
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:02,094
- You can't take it down.
- Take it down. She never has to know.

65
00:03:02,214 --> 00:03:04,702
- She's gonna hear about it.
- Who's gonna about what?

66
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:09,484
izzie...
Move your hand.

67
00:03:10,113 --> 00:03:11,653
Oh, come on. Move it.

68
00:03:18,238 --> 00:03:19,271
Good for him.

69
00:03:25,448 --> 00:03:27,544
No one wins the harper avery.

70
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:30,255
That is so weird. We know
someone who won the harper avery.

71
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:31,676
Hey, talk to Meredith,

72
00:03:31,796 --> 00:03:34,176
see if she'd be okay if rebecca
moved in for a couple of weeks.

73
00:03:34,296 --> 00:03:36,427
- What?
- Yeah, we're gonna get our own place,

74
00:03:36,587 --> 00:03:39,055
but it's gonna take me a while
to save up for a security deposit.

75
00:03:39,215 --> 00:03:40,385
She's married.

76
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:42,729
She's leaving her husband.
She's telling him right now.

77
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,103
- Okay. What about her kid?
- I don't know.

78
00:03:45,263 --> 00:03:47,661
It's a mess right now,
but we're figuring it all out.

79
00:03:47,868 --> 00:03:48,879
Alex, wait.

80
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:51,220
She's pregnant.
She's knocked up.

81
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:52,823
Look, just talk to Meredith.

82
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:58,045
Who would like to present?

83
00:03:58,651 --> 00:03:59,815
Uh, Kyra Marshall,

84
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:02,573
history of end-stage
cardiomyopathy and COPD,

85
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:05,907
now awaiting a heart transplant, but
her antibody levels were so elevated,

86
00:04:06,027 --> 00:04:07,907
she was in danger of rejecting
any donor heart.

87
00:04:08,027 --> 00:04:09,749
So how did we counteract that?

88
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,815
We've been giving her
high levels of chemotherapy

89
00:04:11,956 --> 00:04:14,556
- to suppress her immune system.
- And what precautions have we taken

90
00:04:14,676 --> 00:04:17,468
to make sure that she is not
exposed to infection?

91
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:20,555
Yang, am I boring you?

92
00:04:21,182 --> 00:04:23,207
Because if you'd rather spend
the day in the morgue,

93
00:04:23,327 --> 00:04:25,226
I have about 50 cadaver hearts

94
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:27,562
that need to be harvested
for my research.

95
00:04:28,178 --> 00:04:30,415
So Kyra Marshall's protocols....

96
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:32,291
I would love to go to the morgue.

97
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,132
Thank you.

98
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:36,878
Let Yang be an example
to all of you.

99
00:04:36,998 --> 00:04:39,111
There is no shame
in grunt work.

100
00:04:39,432 --> 00:04:42,258
Now let's meet our mom
in a plastic bubble.

101
00:04:42,671 --> 00:04:44,238
Get me outta here, Lucas!

102
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:46,497
I need to get outta here!

103
00:04:46,657 --> 00:04:48,201
Get them to let me outta here.

104
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,877
- Honey, calm down.
- You said I'd have a heart in 3 weeks.

105
00:04:51,232 --> 00:04:52,629
and it's been eight.

106
00:04:52,789 --> 00:04:56,773
It has been eight weeks without
touching anoer human being

107
00:04:59,253 --> 00:05:01,167
- Kyra, listen to.
- No!

108
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,460
Kyra, you need to listen to me.

109
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,223
I want to leave.

110
00:05:05,706 --> 00:05:07,861
I want to hug my kids,

111
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:10,438
and I want to kiss my husband.

112
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,582
And I w...
God, I'm going crazy in here.

113
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:16,444
Kyra, come here.
Kyra, take my hand...

114
00:05:16,746 --> 00:05:18,529
Kyra, take my hand.

115
00:05:22,026 --> 00:05:23,743
You are gonna leave here soon.

116
00:05:23,903 --> 00:05:27,121
That is what I came to tell you.
We have a heart for you.

117
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,440
We have a heart.

118
00:05:36,434 --> 00:05:37,730
You paged me, chief?

119
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,079
Human resources called.
As of this morning,

120
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,803
the nurses are boycotting
your surgeries.

121
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:45,181
I haven't done anything
to the nurses.

122
00:05:45,728 --> 00:05:47,926
- Nothing that can get us sued.
- Whatever you did,

123
00:05:48,046 --> 00:05:50,687
they felt strongly enough about it
that they sent their union rep.

124
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:56,526
Adele?

125
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:58,444
Wait, your wife's the union goon?

126
00:05:58,604 --> 00:06:00,377
Nurse mediator, Dr. Sloan.

127
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:03,588
And you know Wayne Sheehan
from human resources.

128
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:06,242
- But how did you get in...
- Adele used to be a nurse.

129
00:06:06,362 --> 00:06:08,621
Apparently, she's gotten back
into the field.

130
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:11,039
I'm not just a housewife anymore.

131
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:13,543
There have been some complaints
about Dr. Sloan.

132
00:06:13,663 --> 00:06:17,002
Complaints that this hospital
has, up until now, ignored.

133
00:06:17,122 --> 00:06:19,173
Hey, everything I did was consensual.

134
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,342
In fact, some of 'em
even begged for it.

135
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,470
No formal harassment
complaints have been filed.

136
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:29,495
However, the board has decided
to aggressively protect itself

137
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:33,229
from possible future litigation,
so as of today,

138
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:35,825
if a hospital employee
is having a sexual relationship

139
00:06:35,945 --> 00:06:37,734
with another employee,

140
00:06:37,894 --> 00:06:39,495
they have got to register it.

141
00:06:40,206 --> 00:06:42,030
It's called "Date and Tell."

142
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,777
- This some kind of joke?
- Do you want to wait until you have

143
00:06:44,899 --> 00:06:47,211
a $20 million lawsuit
on your hands?

144
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:49,329
Fill out the form.

145
00:06:49,489 --> 00:06:51,678
Shut up and fill out the damn form.

146
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,374
And you, too, richard.

Sync: ¤AkaZab¤, Benj!

148
00:07:04,281 --> 00:07:05,905
Dr. Yang, are you okay?

149
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:09,135
I mean, I just wanted
to check because you passed up

150
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:12,673
a really awesome transplant case
with Dr. Hahn, and I...

151
00:07:16,354 --> 00:07:18,858
Is this about the thing
with... with Dr. Burke?

152
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:22,050
I know that you two
were together and...

153
00:07:49,466 --> 00:07:51,156
Should I be doing something?

154
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:53,104
Can I help you in...

155
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,963
I'll just go upstairs
and go charting. I...

156
00:08:30,131 --> 00:08:33,361
- If you needed more money, all you...
- I don't need more money.

157
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:35,342
I have 50% of yours.

158
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:38,185
What I need
is to be taken seriously.

159
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,412
I'm working. I'm loving it.

160
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:42,650
I've changed.

161
00:08:43,548 --> 00:08:44,735
I've changed, too.

162
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:47,259
- How?
- I'm spending more time at home.

163
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:49,407
I'm delegating.

164
00:08:49,724 --> 00:08:50,894
I've heard that before.

165
00:08:51,014 --> 00:08:53,828
No, no. I've gotten myself an intern.

166
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:57,734
The chief's intern.

167
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:01,156
Change...

168
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:05,006
It feels good, doesn't it?

169
00:09:05,709 --> 00:09:07,466
- O'malley.
- Yes, sir.

170
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:10,174
I've been watching you, O'Malley,
and frankly,

171
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,610
I'm worried.

172
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:15,324
A guy like you
can't get too comfortable.

173
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:19,018
A guy like you
needs a challenge,

174
00:09:19,694 --> 00:09:20,938
needs change.

175
00:09:22,006 --> 00:09:24,139
Now that you mention it,
I've been feeling unchallenged.

176
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:26,736
What would you think about
being my intern?

177
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:28,600
The chief's intern.

178
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:29,989
The chief's intern?

179
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:31,624
George O'Malley...

180
00:09:32,856 --> 00:09:34,605
Inyern to the chief.

181
00:09:34,725 --> 00:09:37,538
George O'Malley, intern to the chief.
Is that even a real thing?

182
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:40,711
We need to get aggressive
with the virus.

183
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,216
If we inject
the tumor in two sites,

184
00:09:44,336 --> 00:09:47,247
we can actually saturate it
and have a real impact.

185
00:09:48,532 --> 00:09:50,332
Okay, now needle number one.

186
00:09:51,545 --> 00:09:53,482
We will go into the tumor here.

187
00:09:54,186 --> 00:09:55,425
Needle number two

188
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:57,425
goes right here.

189
00:09:58,657 --> 00:10:01,160
Now for the virus
to take full effect,

190
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,684
we need to inject it
at exactly the same time.

191
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:05,223
The same time.

192
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:07,655
You're needle number two.

193
00:10:07,805 --> 00:10:09,737
Don't be nervous.
We're gonna practice.

194
00:10:14,402 --> 00:10:15,407
Now...

195
00:10:16,237 --> 00:10:17,634
We'll use the fluorescein

196
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:20,817
to help us ilate the tumor
from the surrounding tissue.

197
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:28,682
Okay.

198
00:10:29,518 --> 00:10:31,123
Now remember...

199
00:10:31,543 --> 00:10:33,261
We have to be completely in sync.

200
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,701
Okay? Let me know
when you're ready.

201
00:10:37,842 --> 00:10:39,183
He's with Rose,

202
00:10:39,343 --> 00:10:42,937
he's with Rose,
he's with Rose.

203
00:10:43,281 --> 00:10:44,689
Do you like princesses?

204
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:48,359
Yeah, sure.

205
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,529
When you take out mommy's
broken heart, what happens?

206
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:54,138
Well, we're gonna put her
on a heart-lung machine.

207
00:10:55,298 --> 00:10:56,993
It's like with snow white, when...

208
00:10:57,153 --> 00:10:59,161
she eats the poison apple
and she dies for a while,

209
00:10:59,281 --> 00:11:01,045
but she's not really dead.
It's like that.

210
00:11:01,165 --> 00:11:02,832
My mom's gonna be dead?

211
00:11:02,992 --> 00:11:04,083
Snow white dies?

212
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,724
When they're little,
you skip over the scary parts.

213
00:11:09,035 --> 00:11:10,107
I'm really sorry.

214
00:11:10,227 --> 00:11:12,140
It's okay. You don't have kids.

215
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,467
How would you know?

216
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,848
Dr. Bailey, if I can't
get a hold of my patient,

217
00:11:18,968 --> 00:11:21,331
is it okay to give her test
results to her friend?

218
00:11:21,621 --> 00:11:24,128
What if her friend is a really good
friend of mine, and he's changing

219
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:26,678
his life for her 'cause he thinks
she's pregnant, and she's not.

220
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:28,930
Stevens, you want to win yourself
a harper avery,

221
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,210
you need to master
the basics of privacy.

222
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,149
The chief needs to know who you've slept
with by the end of the day. Be thorough.

223
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,285
The chief needs to know who you've slept
with by the end of the day. Be thorough.

224
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,816
The chief needs to know...
Who you've slept with

225
00:11:41,936 --> 00:11:43,231
by the end of the day.

226
00:11:43,863 --> 00:11:45,815
- Be thorough.
- This is no one's business.

227
00:11:45,935 --> 00:11:48,603
It's the chief's business,
so it's my business.

228
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:51,005
- I'm the chief's intern.
- Let me see that.

229
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,639
The chief said you're the only person
in the whole hospital who is exempt.

230
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:57,009
Congratulations.

231
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:03,893
What do they mean
by "sexual relations"?

232
00:12:05,547 --> 00:12:06,674
There are levels...

233
00:12:07,506 --> 00:12:09,315
Of... intimacy.

234
00:12:09,475 --> 00:12:13,110
Well...
They don't need to know the...

235
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,118
They just want to know the...

236
00:12:16,816 --> 00:12:18,115
Highest level.

237
00:12:20,224 --> 00:12:21,482
Okay, then.

238
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:24,413
I won't need one of these.

239
00:12:25,452 --> 00:12:26,452
You...

240
00:12:29,537 --> 00:12:31,274
S... okay. Sure.

241
00:12:31,394 --> 00:12:33,506
I just don't wanna
turn this back...

242
00:12:34,734 --> 00:12:36,321
- Freak.
- I am not a...

243
00:12:37,338 --> 00:12:38,713
I am the chief's intern.

244
00:12:39,585 --> 00:12:41,343
Okay.
That's not a real job.

245
00:12:41,463 --> 00:12:43,265
I just need your form
by the end of the day.

246
00:12:44,002 --> 00:12:46,472
It's because
I don't have a penis, isn't it?

247
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:52,786
I publish more.
I do double the research.

248
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,641
I deserve this
more than burke.

249
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:57,399
It's a big men's club,
and it's not fair.

250
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,595
I didn't even realize
you were being considered.

251
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:02,997
I wasn't gonna mention it
until I won.

252
00:13:04,029 --> 00:13:05,550
Then I was gonna be all nonchalant,

253
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:07,484
like awards
don't matter to me.

254
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:10,167
Now Burke's gone
and ruined my whole act.

255
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:13,170
You want to meet me at Joe's tonight?
We can trash-talk him.

256
00:13:16,195 --> 00:13:18,217
I can't.
I have this other thing.

257
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:21,411
Uh, hey, can you...
Can you talk to the nurses?

258
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:22,972
I need someone to...

259
00:13:23,132 --> 00:13:25,975
tell 'em to call off the boycott,
tell 'em I'm a good guy.

260
00:13:26,448 --> 00:13:28,398
We don't think
you are a good guy.

261
00:13:29,055 --> 00:13:31,093
Dr. Torres thinks
I'm a good guy.

262
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,946
Don't you, Callie?

263
00:13:41,973 --> 00:13:43,316
On call room. Now.

264
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:44,849
So...

265
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,544
what's the recovery period
for brain surgery?

266
00:13:47,902 --> 00:13:50,709
It varies, but usually
at least four to six weeks.

267
00:13:51,285 --> 00:13:53,711
Looks like you'll be stuck with me
for 4 to 6 weeks.

268
00:13:53,871 --> 00:13:55,476
You deploy in five days, man.

269
00:13:55,683 --> 00:13:57,882
That was before I knew
you had a brain tumor.

270
00:13:58,042 --> 00:14:01,302
No. Don't screw this up for yourself.
You're a soldier. It's who you are.

271
00:14:01,462 --> 00:14:03,929
Besides, I'm probably not even gonna
make it through surgery, okay?

272
00:14:04,089 --> 00:14:06,557
Cool. Then I'll be good
to go in about 5 days.

273
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,440
Why did you come, man?

274
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:17,143
How could I not?

275
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:30,789
God, you're so paranoid.

276
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:55,064
Mr. Covington.

277
00:15:04,228 --> 00:15:05,229
Get out.

278
00:15:06,647 --> 00:15:08,345
Don't make me throw you out.

279
00:15:12,199 --> 00:15:13,422
What's wrong?

280
00:15:14,624 --> 00:15:15,910
Nothing's wrong, sir.

281
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:19,813
Nothing at all.

282
00:15:31,966 --> 00:15:34,311
Thank you for the consult, Dr. Sloan.

283
00:15:36,781 --> 00:15:38,342
- No.
- I haven't said anything.

284
00:15:38,462 --> 00:15:41,318
- I'm not talking to the nurses for you.
- You're dating my best friend.

285
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:42,409
No.

286
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:44,947
Come on. You're one of them.
Tell 'em I'm a good guy,

287
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:47,616
A guy who happens to be
mind-blowingly good at sex.

288
00:15:47,776 --> 00:15:50,227
Yeah, see, but that,
all the talk about all the sex?

289
00:15:50,347 --> 00:15:53,080
It's not what I think of
as good-guy behavior.

290
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,083
I hate women like you.

291
00:15:56,243 --> 00:15:59,587
You string guys along,
acting like sex is some prize,

292
00:15:59,747 --> 00:16:02,979
when really you're just afraid that once
you give it up, he'll lose interest.

293
00:16:08,531 --> 00:16:10,625
You know,
my dad's not a bad guy.

294
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,734
He's just... a soldier.

295
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,170
We're all soldiers.

296
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:18,981
Todd's down in the lobby.

297
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:22,192
He's such an idiot.

298
00:16:22,476 --> 00:16:23,744
He should just go,

299
00:16:24,026 --> 00:16:26,230
put me out of his mind
and just...

300
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,325
- That's not so easy to do.
- It'd be better for everyone,

301
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:31,452
Especially with Dr. Evett
hanging around.

302
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:34,345
- Todd can't risk getting outted.
- It's crazy that you even have to worry

303
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,957
- about stuff like that.
- "Don't ask, Don't tell."

304
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:39,278
Hey, I knew the deal
when I signed on.

305
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:45,329
You keep your personal life
separate from your work life.

306
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:47,441
I just never thought I'd...

307
00:16:48,286 --> 00:16:50,164
meet my personal life at work.

308
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,893
I can still go get todd.

309
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,787
No, I can't.

310
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:00,650
My dad... I can't.

311
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:05,260
I know what you're thinking.

312
00:17:06,631 --> 00:17:09,480
Brave soldier who can't even
step up to his own father.

313
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,987
I was thinking, this is hard.

314
00:17:14,963 --> 00:17:16,763
The gay part or the tumor part?

315
00:17:18,664 --> 00:17:19,885
The whole part.

316
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,716
I need your form.

317
00:17:27,876 --> 00:17:30,013
Lexie, I need you
to fill out a form.

318
00:17:30,182 --> 00:17:31,804
- What's this?
- The sex police.

319
00:17:32,107 --> 00:17:33,722
Meredith, I'm gonna need your form.

320
00:17:33,882 --> 00:17:35,715
Don't ask, don't tell.
Forms are stupid.

321
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:37,518
Yeah, I'm still gonna need it, though.

322
00:17:37,678 --> 00:17:38,769
- Pen?
- I...

323
00:17:40,285 --> 00:17:41,146
I, um...

324
00:17:41,306 --> 00:17:43,029
Think I'll need
one of those after all.

325
00:17:43,149 --> 00:17:44,441
What? Why?

326
00:17:52,058 --> 00:17:53,117
I'll just, um...

327
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,461
Thank you.

328
00:17:58,365 --> 00:18:00,749
- Oh, god. I'm so sorry.
- Do you want me to get cristina?

329
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,299
Derek is with Rose,

330
00:18:02,419 --> 00:18:05,379
and I'm okay
that Derek is with Rose.

331
00:18:07,094 --> 00:18:09,388
Get cristina.
Get her form.

332
00:18:09,508 --> 00:18:12,678
- You don't wanna go near her right now.
- Why, is she crying?

333
00:18:13,204 --> 00:18:15,723
Is she staring straight ahead
being super-scary quiet?

334
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,266
She's singing.

335
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:21,587
I still need your form.

336
00:18:21,757 --> 00:18:23,503
Here, perv boy. Enjoy.

337
00:18:24,571 --> 00:18:25,733
This isn't complete.

338
00:18:26,955 --> 00:18:27,988
It's fine.

339
00:18:30,169 --> 00:18:31,169
What?

340
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:35,378
Oh, right.

341
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,768
Sorry. I forgot.

342
00:18:43,073 --> 00:18:44,793
He forgot he had sex with me?

343
00:18:44,953 --> 00:18:47,838
- I just collect the forms.
- He forgot he had sex with me?

344
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:53,552
Stop singing.

345
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:02,769
You're gonna win your own
harper avery award.

346
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,374
Burke wouldn't have a career
if it hadn't been for you.

347
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:09,784
You saved him when he had his tremor.

348
00:19:09,904 --> 00:19:12,702
The harper avery board
may not know it, but he does.

349
00:19:18,837 --> 00:19:20,132
I'm in therapy...

350
00:19:22,607 --> 00:19:25,565
'Cause he's with Rose. I'm way
more screwed up than you are.

351
00:19:32,555 --> 00:19:33,578
Thank you.

352
00:19:34,929 --> 00:19:36,637
That makes me feel a little better.

353
00:19:38,347 --> 00:19:39,408
You're welcome.

354
00:19:43,428 --> 00:19:45,145
Chief, it... Adele.

355
00:19:45,305 --> 00:19:47,856
Uh, is it true you have
every member of the hospital

356
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:49,964
- filing out this form?
- That's right.

357
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,781
We are taking this very seriously.

358
00:19:53,146 --> 00:19:56,170
But I'm exempt from this?
Me? Just me?

359
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:58,594
I don't even want to see you
holding the form.

360
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,565
Okay, then.

361
00:20:07,045 --> 00:20:08,108
What?

362
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:13,257
100.4.

363
00:20:13,895 --> 00:20:14,967
Sorry, karev.

364
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:16,655
Oh, come on. I'm fine.

365
00:20:16,775 --> 00:20:18,262
Immune system protocols.

366
00:20:18,422 --> 00:20:20,638
I am not putting
Mrs. Marshall at risk.

367
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:22,516
Page Yang.
She's scrubbing in.

368
00:20:22,676 --> 00:20:24,173
You go get Mrs. Marshall's family.

369
00:20:24,293 --> 00:20:26,728
You're on babysitting duty
the rest of the day.

370
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:32,739
Darren.

371
00:20:39,495 --> 00:20:40,800
We can take a moment.

372
00:20:48,188 --> 00:20:49,211
No.

373
00:20:49,536 --> 00:20:50,589
Are you sure?

374
00:20:57,527 --> 00:20:58,427
No.

375
00:21:00,294 --> 00:21:01,305
Let's just go.

376
00:21:15,759 --> 00:21:17,364
Donor heart's on its way.

377
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:25,043
Can't imagine how you must feel
about Burke's award.

378
00:21:25,694 --> 00:21:27,681
You actually helped him
with all that research.

379
00:21:27,801 --> 00:21:30,003
He didn't even mention you
in the article.

380
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,695
Well, I guess it's no surprise.

381
00:21:33,815 --> 00:21:36,214
His arrogance is legendary.

382
00:21:41,156 --> 00:21:43,560
I thought we finally had
some common ground.

383
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,500
Good for you...

384
00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:51,811
Refusing to trash him,
rising above.

385
00:21:52,266 --> 00:21:53,479
That's very impressive.

386
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:56,350
I am going to follow
your example, Yang.

387
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,091
Congratulations, Preston.

388
00:22:00,498 --> 00:22:01,831
I wish you well.

389
00:22:09,282 --> 00:22:10,925
Okay, remember what I said.

390
00:22:11,233 --> 00:22:15,130
We have to be in total sync for the virs
to have maximum infiltration.

391
00:22:15,872 --> 00:22:16,881
Okay?

392
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:18,533
Ready?

393
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:21,859
Go.

394
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:31,951
Easy. Slow down.

395
00:22:33,457 --> 00:22:34,648
Easy. Slow down.

396
00:22:34,808 --> 00:22:37,567
Slow down. Look at me.
Don't look at the machine. Look at me.

397
00:22:38,347 --> 00:22:39,444
Slowly.

398
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:45,704
That's it.

399
00:22:47,892 --> 00:22:48,916
That's it.

400
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:58,991
The virus is in.

401
00:23:03,876 --> 00:23:05,595
We're standing on the moon, Dr. Grey.

402
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,727
I just wanted to drop off
the form myself.

403
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:13,937
Answer any questions you might have.

404
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:16,231
There are interns listed on this form.

405
00:23:17,154 --> 00:23:20,071
I require the energy of youth.

406
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:23,613
Dr. Shepherd was just
a moment of weakness, for both of us.

407
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:26,144
- Dr. Sloan?
- That was many moments,

408
00:23:26,264 --> 00:23:28,098
in on call rooms.

409
00:23:28,218 --> 00:23:29,578
Very hot.

410
00:23:29,935 --> 00:23:32,414
- Steamy.
- Dr. Bailey, I get the joke, okay?

411
00:23:32,574 --> 00:23:34,346
See? This is a joke to you.

412
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,960
I am a single woman.

413
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,857
I've been a single woman
for some time now,

414
00:23:39,977 --> 00:23:43,884
but the very idea
that I could have a sexual encounter...

415
00:23:44,246 --> 00:23:47,159
A consensual sexual encounter...
Is a joke to you?

416
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,304
- Dr. Bailey, I never...
- So much so you would single me out

417
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:52,924
of this entire hospital
as the one person

418
00:23:53,044 --> 00:23:55,565
who couldn't interest
a member of the opposite sex?

419
00:23:56,306 --> 00:23:58,106
It's... It's just...

420
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:00,081
- It's harassment.
- Adele.

421
00:24:00,321 --> 00:24:01,832
Just shame on you, sir.

422
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:03,336
Just shame on you!

423
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:08,213
Liquids for your fever.
Drink this.

424
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:09,762
- I'm fine.
- You're run-down.

425
00:24:09,882 --> 00:24:11,774
- I'm fine.
- You're taking on too much.

426
00:24:11,894 --> 00:24:14,248
She can't just move up here.
You guys need to slow down...

427
00:24:14,368 --> 00:24:17,542
What's your problem? You can't pass
a baby on the street without stopping.

428
00:24:17,702 --> 00:24:20,379
The only friggin' baby in the world
you're not happy about is mine.

429
00:24:20,596 --> 00:24:22,422
It's not that I'm not happy
for you. It's...

430
00:24:22,582 --> 00:24:23,632
What?

431
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,509
- Nothing.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

432
00:24:36,654 --> 00:24:38,520
So are we on for tonight,

433
00:24:38,682 --> 00:24:39,706
or what?

434
00:24:40,043 --> 00:24:43,160
I don't know. I mean,
I told you, I have this other thing.

435
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,591
I don't, uh...

436
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:52,019
Make friends easily.

437
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:53,829
I'm awkward

438
00:24:53,989 --> 00:24:56,283
and I'm bad at small talk,

439
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:58,903
and I generally don't like
people I don't know,

440
00:24:59,023 --> 00:25:00,032
but...

441
00:25:01,764 --> 00:25:03,147
I made friends with you.

442
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:06,491
And now you have this "thing,"
and that thing is Sloan.

443
00:25:08,657 --> 00:25:10,539
Are you mad that I'm sleeping
with Mark Sloan?

444
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:13,390
I'm not mad that you're sleeping
with Sloan. I'm mad

445
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:16,598
that you didn't tell me you're sleeping
with Sloan. I'm mad at you...

446
00:25:17,394 --> 00:25:21,009
Because instead of telling me and
admitting that you're one of those girls

447
00:25:21,129 --> 00:25:24,200
who goes all poofy when she gets
a boyfriend, you disappear...

448
00:25:24,786 --> 00:25:26,119
With your "thing."

449
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,492
I don't make friends easily.

450
00:25:42,658 --> 00:25:45,551
That was great. Totally in sync,
like we were one person.

451
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:47,830
Yeah, it was great.
You did great.

452
00:25:48,335 --> 00:25:49,349
Thanks.

453
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:56,095
Obviously, his intracranial pressure is
going to need to be monitored overnight,

454
00:25:56,262 --> 00:25:58,348
so if you just tell me
the parameters...

455
00:25:58,495 --> 00:26:01,033
I'll stay.
I mean, we could. I...

456
00:26:02,563 --> 00:26:03,857
We can stay together.

457
00:26:04,965 --> 00:26:06,007
How'd it go?

458
00:26:07,286 --> 00:26:09,244
Great.
It went really...

459
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:12,782
Really well.
Dr. Grey had one of the...

460
00:26:14,063 --> 00:26:16,682
She had one of the...
One of the injections.

461
00:26:16,941 --> 00:26:17,900
I was just...

462
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,425
I was heading home.
And I didn't know if you...

463
00:26:20,556 --> 00:26:21,818
Yeah, right.

464
00:26:22,629 --> 00:26:24,085
I need to stay here tonight.

465
00:26:25,916 --> 00:26:27,086
- Okay.
- Okay?

466
00:26:27,233 --> 00:26:28,215
I'll just...

467
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:32,963
- Okay.
- Rose.

468
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:34,760
Wait.

469
00:26:40,553 --> 00:26:43,313
- I can page you if there any problems.
- I'll stay.

470
00:26:43,786 --> 00:26:45,866
If you want me to stay, I'll...

471
00:26:46,345 --> 00:26:47,400
I'll stay.

472
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,364
No. You should go be with Rose.

473
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:04,862
Sex? Let's go.

474
00:27:09,797 --> 00:27:11,003
Are you coming?

475
00:27:12,668 --> 00:27:13,785
I'm just...

476
00:27:14,832 --> 00:27:16,597
- Not in the mood.
- What?

477
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:19,128
- You're always in the mood.
- I know.

478
00:27:20,453 --> 00:27:21,796
But I'm just...

479
00:27:24,467 --> 00:27:26,496
All my surgeries got canceled today.

480
00:27:28,803 --> 00:27:30,014
You're useless.

481
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,916
Donor heart just arrived.
And I'll take

482
00:27:37,042 --> 00:27:39,258
- you down to the waiting room.
- Something's wrong.

483
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:41,296
She's having trouble breathing.

484
00:27:41,694 --> 00:27:44,207
Decreased breath sounds on the right
side. Her lung has dropped.

485
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:46,244
- Page Hahn.
- Right away, Dr. Karev.

486
00:27:46,995 --> 00:27:48,251
She's not moving!

487
00:27:52,955 --> 00:27:55,510
What are you doing?
You can't go in there.

488
00:27:56,546 --> 00:27:58,820
You can't break the isolation barrier.

489
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,020
- You need to get your kids outta here.
- Is she dead?*

490
00:28:04,322 --> 00:28:05,573
Mr. Marshall, your kids.

491
00:28:05,695 --> 00:28:07,766
Don't let her die.
Please don't let her die.

492
00:28:08,078 --> 00:28:10,232
Okay, Jessie, Zoe,

493
00:28:10,394 --> 00:28:13,090
this is the scary part,
so I need you guys to turn around.

494
00:28:13,547 --> 00:28:15,530
Come on. Just turn around.
I know what I'm doing.

495
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:17,357
I'll tell you when it's over.

496
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:30,747
Okay, Zoe, Jessie, it's okay.
You can look at your mommy now.

497
00:28:31,129 --> 00:28:33,131
Mommy's okay. God.

498
00:28:33,308 --> 00:28:34,215
It's okay.

499
00:28:35,206 --> 00:28:36,009
It's okay.

500
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:42,993
Here are the rest of the forms, sir,
alphabetized and broken down

501
00:28:43,128 --> 00:28:44,934
- by department.
- See that, Adele?

502
00:28:45,094 --> 00:28:47,372
Didn't have to lift a finger.
I'm delegating.

503
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,065
Well, I've seen
some progress today.

504
00:28:50,431 --> 00:28:51,698
Well, thank you.

505
00:28:57,469 --> 00:28:58,580
Dr. Webber,

506
00:28:59,316 --> 00:29:02,396
- may I have a word with you privately?
- I'll be right outside.

507
00:29:04,817 --> 00:29:06,956
I gave up a major surgery today, and...

508
00:29:07,824 --> 00:29:10,222
all my friends think
I'm a brownnosing perv.

509
00:29:10,481 --> 00:29:13,726
But I... It was worth it
because I thought that...

510
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,106
That you saw me, but...

511
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:20,146
All due respect sir, you're using me
to get back together with your wife.

512
00:29:20,266 --> 00:29:22,878
- O'Malley.
- I don't know if it's possible

513
00:29:22,998 --> 00:29:26,180
to quit a thing that isn't even
a real thing, but...

514
00:29:27,121 --> 00:29:29,145
I do.
I quit.

515
00:29:29,306 --> 00:29:30,430
O'Malley, wait.

516
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:36,299
The truth is, I do see you, O'Malley.

517
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:38,865
I see how hard you're working.

518
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:41,408
The Chief's intern is not a real job,

519
00:29:42,493 --> 00:29:43,883
but I'd like it to be.

520
00:29:46,294 --> 00:29:49,680
Let's give him acetaminophen,
add a 500 of vancomycin

521
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,876
and blood and urine cultures also.

522
00:29:52,188 --> 00:29:54,139
If you want to take a break,
I'll sit with him.

523
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:55,713
No, I'm okay.

524
00:30:10,513 --> 00:30:11,517
V-Fib.

525
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:14,703
- Charge the paddles to 300.
- They are charged.

526
00:30:15,276 --> 00:30:16,192
Clear.

527
00:30:28,575 --> 00:30:31,354
I know my being here
makes you feel uncomfortable,

528
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:35,420
but I was trained not to leave a man
when he's down. Our man is down.

529
00:30:35,784 --> 00:30:37,732
- Todd.
- We both love him.

530
00:30:38,195 --> 00:30:39,321
- Todd.
- No!

531
00:30:41,468 --> 00:30:43,206
All I want to know is how he's doing.

532
00:30:50,338 --> 00:30:51,530
Oh, god.

533
00:30:56,251 --> 00:30:58,351
Dr. Karev saved your life,

534
00:30:58,603 --> 00:31:00,904
but the chance that you were
exposed to infection

535
00:31:01,064 --> 00:31:02,197
is too great.

536
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:04,449
Can she get another heart?

537
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:06,521
You'll be at the top
of the list.

538
00:31:06,641 --> 00:31:09,287
But m gonna have to stay
in isolation, right?

539
00:31:27,004 --> 00:31:29,010
His spinal tap showed encephalitis.

540
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,021
The virus reverted.

541
00:31:33,569 --> 00:31:35,690
There's no way we could've
predicted this.

542
00:31:44,985 --> 00:31:46,756
On the way here, I stopped...

543
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:48,361
and I got this...

544
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:51,756
For when we get it right.

545
00:31:53,934 --> 00:31:55,080
Because we will.

546
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:57,552
We will succeed.

547
00:31:58,289 --> 00:31:59,754
We will save someone.

548
00:32:01,195 --> 00:32:03,739
And when we do, we're gonna
open this bottle of champagne,

549
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:06,589
and we're gonna drink
to Phillip Robinson

550
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,187
and Darren Covington...

551
00:32:10,508 --> 00:32:12,934
And all the other patients
who helped us change

552
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,004
the face of medicine,

553
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:17,110
and we're gonna celebrate.

554
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:19,950
We're gonna use this
as our victory dance.

555
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,262
Meredith, we will...

556
00:32:26,243 --> 00:32:28,158
We will open this bottle of champagne.

557
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,617
Going through all the forms,
I noticed you didn't turn yours in.

558
00:32:43,030 --> 00:32:44,106
No, no, sir.

559
00:32:44,366 --> 00:32:45,789
Well, I need you to.

560
00:32:45,974 --> 00:32:48,678
The hospital is still liable
even though Dr. Burke isn't here.

561
00:33:08,955 --> 00:33:09,961
There.

562
00:33:10,102 --> 00:33:13,270
My sexual relationship.
Preston Burke on paper.

563
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,555
Satisfied?

564
00:33:14,734 --> 00:33:16,189
I know this is difficult for you.

565
00:33:16,314 --> 00:33:18,576
No, it's not difficult, sir.
It is simple.

566
00:33:18,818 --> 00:33:20,623
Burke is not here.
He's gone.

567
00:33:20,972 --> 00:33:22,399
And he's the better for it.

568
00:33:22,694 --> 00:33:24,714
He's winning
the harper avery award and...

569
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:26,756
being celebrated all over the world.

570
00:33:26,942 --> 00:33:28,210
That is not difficult.

571
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:29,581
He's out there.

572
00:33:30,435 --> 00:33:31,642
And I'm here...

573
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:33,872
Where everything is the same.

574
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:36,734
I still live in his apartment,

575
00:33:36,854 --> 00:33:38,822
I walk the same halls
of this hospital,

576
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,629
I wear the same scrubs,
and even that is not difficult.

577
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:43,773
This is where I am.

578
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,557
This is where I choose to be.

579
00:33:47,912 --> 00:33:48,987
But, sir...

580
00:33:49,499 --> 00:33:51,348
When his hand was shaking,

581
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:54,263
I performed his surgeries,

582
00:33:54,942 --> 00:33:57,204
I kept his secrets,
I nursed his pride.

583
00:33:57,585 --> 00:33:59,957
You know it, and I know it,
and he knows it.

584
00:34:01,336 --> 00:34:02,511
He knows it.

585
00:34:04,282 --> 00:34:07,574
And yet, nowhere in the newspaper
article does my name appear.

586
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:15,661
I am the unseen hand
to his brilliance.

587
00:34:18,219 --> 00:34:19,277
Excuse me.

588
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,544
And yet,
while everything is...

589
00:34:27,037 --> 00:34:29,328
the Same, it's very, very different.

590
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,837
Now I'm lucky
if I get to hold a clamp.

591
00:34:33,768 --> 00:34:35,970
Hahn treats me like...

592
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,320
I was his hand,

593
00:34:43,371 --> 00:34:45,004
and now I'm a ghost.

594
00:34:47,308 --> 00:34:48,844
That's not difficult.

595
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:51,810
It's unbearable.

596
00:34:53,197 --> 00:34:55,111
I know everybody
is proud of him,

597
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:56,441
but I'm not.

598
00:34:57,659 --> 00:34:59,199
And I do not wish him well.

599
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:04,647
This boycott has gone on
long enough.

600
00:35:04,827 --> 00:35:07,651
Now, okay,
I have no authority here, but...

601
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,580
I would like to offer
my thoughts on Dr. Sloan.

602
00:35:12,273 --> 00:35:13,510
You're doing great.

603
00:35:13,932 --> 00:35:16,552
This man is a whore,

604
00:35:16,944 --> 00:35:20,354
has always been a whore,
will probably always be a whore.

605
00:35:20,474 --> 00:35:23,207
But, I mean, that's not a secret.
He's not keeping it hidden.

606
00:35:23,368 --> 00:35:25,792
You all knew who he was before
you got involved with him.

607
00:35:25,912 --> 00:35:27,128
Now you want to be all

608
00:35:27,288 --> 00:35:29,964
"woe is me,
he doesn't call me back,

609
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:31,507
"he's dating other women."

610
00:35:31,667 --> 00:35:34,677
He's nasty,
but he's a doctor here

611
00:35:34,837 --> 00:35:36,424
and a pretty good one.

612
00:35:37,466 --> 00:35:40,016
So let us all close our knees

613
00:35:40,477 --> 00:35:44,103
and get back to our jobs
so he can get back to his job

614
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,564
and help the people that really need it.

615
00:35:50,785 --> 00:35:51,902
Disperse.

616
00:36:00,502 --> 00:36:01,808
Oh, my god.

617
00:36:04,063 --> 00:36:05,158
Hi!

618
00:36:11,515 --> 00:36:13,083
My baby.

619
00:36:16,049 --> 00:36:17,683
I heard. You did great.

620
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:24,359
Look, you think I'm scum.
You think I can't do this.

621
00:36:24,479 --> 00:36:27,897
But it's my kid, Izzie, my kid,
and what you think doesn't matter.

622
00:36:33,123 --> 00:36:35,968
I want him to have
a military burial.

623
00:37:26,945 --> 00:37:28,332
<i>It was a good day.</i>

624
00:37:30,504 --> 00:37:31,593
Heading home.

625
00:37:33,135 --> 00:37:35,032
Heading home early.

626
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:39,570
Maybe you have changed.

627
00:37:44,414 --> 00:37:45,683
That's a nice blouse.

628
00:37:48,922 --> 00:37:50,809
<i>Maybe even a great day.</i>

629
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,609
- Good night.
- Did you get in touch with the patient?

630
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,928
- No.
- Did you tell her friend?

631
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,945
No.

632
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:05,983
Even though it killed me,

633
00:38:06,103 --> 00:38:07,297
I didn't tell.

634
00:38:07,578 --> 00:38:08,873
You're growing, Stevens.

635
00:38:10,097 --> 00:38:12,144
Yeah, well, I wish it would stop.

636
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:18,007
My husband is out on a date...

637
00:38:18,944 --> 00:38:19,985
Right now.

638
00:38:20,377 --> 00:38:21,385
On a date.

639
00:38:25,159 --> 00:38:26,821
<i>I was a good doctor...</i>

640
00:38:30,421 --> 00:38:31,970
<i>Even when it was hard.</i>

641
00:38:32,949 --> 00:38:34,845
<i>I was the me in my head.</i>

642
00:38:35,858 --> 00:38:39,285
I just called three of my ex-boyfriends
to find out how unforgettable I am.

643
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:42,658
I left messages.
I'm sure they'll call me back.

644
00:38:44,032 --> 00:38:46,577
So you made a mistake
and you slept with Alex?

645
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:50,027
No one
has made more mistakes

646
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:52,707
or slept with more inappropriate people

647
00:38:53,129 --> 00:38:55,927
or been more publicly humiliated
than me.

648
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,105
Let me be an inspiration.

649
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:00,046
Look at me.

650
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,001
I am the Chief's intern.

651
00:39:02,492 --> 00:39:03,886
I am the man

652
00:39:04,363 --> 00:39:05,931
at the right hand...

653
00:39:07,203 --> 00:39:08,480
Of the man.

654
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:12,270
Okay, I've been avoiding you.

655
00:39:12,496 --> 00:39:13,504
But...

656
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:16,163
When she was here, Addison said...

657
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:17,435
Well, she implied...

658
00:39:17,601 --> 00:39:20,528
that, well, we...
That I, that I was...

659
00:39:22,254 --> 00:39:23,370
That...

660
00:39:25,802 --> 00:39:27,645
You and I might be lesbians.

661
00:39:44,213 --> 00:39:46,297
<i>There was a moment when I thought...</i>

662
00:39:46,782 --> 00:39:48,014
<i>I can't do this.</i>

663
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,532
Well, I'm glad some things
haven't changed.

664
00:39:57,631 --> 00:39:59,444
<i>I can't do this alone.</i>

665
00:39:59,791 --> 00:40:01,594
The most refined, professional,

666
00:40:01,785 --> 00:40:04,930
ladylike doctor in this hospital
came to my defense tonight.

667
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:08,286
The best she could come up with
was, "He's a whore."

668
00:40:09,424 --> 00:40:10,617
I'm a whore.

669
00:40:11,771 --> 00:40:13,048
I slept with her.

670
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,534
The whole time,
I was thinking about Meredith.

671
00:40:18,277 --> 00:40:19,695
Who's the bigger whore?

672
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,089
<i>But I closed my eyes...</i>

673
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:24,425
<i>And imagined myself doing it.</i>

674
00:40:27,101 --> 00:40:28,208
<i>And I did.</i>

675
00:40:29,109 --> 00:40:30,781
<i>I blocked out the fear...</i>

676
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:33,596
<i>And I did it.</i>

677
00:40:35,342 --> 00:40:36,812
It was a really good day.

678
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,890
Look, I'm just gonna say this because
your insurance only covers 20 sessions,

679
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:46,095
and I feel we should get
right to the point.

680
00:40:47,128 --> 00:40:48,564
That was a load of crap.

681
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:52,787
It was not a good day.

682
00:40:52,948 --> 00:40:56,999
Your patient died alone, unable to
tell the love of his life how he felt.

683
00:40:57,184 --> 00:41:00,627
But he did it for his boyfriend. I mean,
I actually think it was kind of heroic.

684
00:41:00,811 --> 00:41:02,658
- It's a load of crap.
- Stop saying that.

685
00:41:02,778 --> 00:41:04,851
Look, let me draw the parallels for you.

686
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,632
The tragic patient dies alone

687
00:41:07,763 --> 00:41:09,929
while the love of his life
is literally

688
00:41:10,089 --> 00:41:11,447
in the next room.

689
00:41:12,141 --> 00:41:12,972
That's you.

690
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:15,571
What are you talking about?
I'm not dying alone.

691
00:41:15,691 --> 00:41:18,705
Oh, but I think you are.
And you're, you're telling yourself

692
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:22,400
you're a hero, when in reality,
all you are is alone.

693
00:41:22,561 --> 00:41:24,552
- Thatis a load of crap.
- He's with Rose.

694
00:41:28,424 --> 00:41:29,857
You know what? I'm...

695
00:41:30,186 --> 00:41:31,802
- Not gonna do this.
- He's with Rose.

696
00:41:31,943 --> 00:41:34,722
- Why do you keep saying that?
- Because if you can't see what's wrong

697
00:41:34,848 --> 00:41:37,615
with that sentence "He's with Rose",
we're never gonna get anywhere.

698
00:41:37,735 --> 00:41:40,856
- He's with Rose.
- Okay! So he's with Rose. So what?

699
00:41:40,976 --> 00:41:43,269
And if he's with Rose,
that means he's not with you.

700
00:41:43,389 --> 00:41:45,672
And do you know why he's not with you?

701
00:41:47,922 --> 00:41:49,009
You're scared.

702
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:51,720
Are you calling me a coward?

703
00:41:54,324 --> 00:41:57,268
- I think you're very frightened.
- Are you calling me a coward?

704
00:41:58,558 --> 00:41:59,590
What do you think?
