1
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,540
previously on "grey's anatomy"...

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:09,720
the chief is under the spell of
some insane man in camouflage.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,660
major owen hunt. I'm a trauma surgeon.

4
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,530
You're reading your mom's diary?

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,690
I'm not half the surgeon my mother was.

6
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,980
the chief wants us to give
george one of our interns?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,330
You di't even think to ask for me?

8
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:23,890
Screw you,Dr. O'malley.

9
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:26,220
We can take it slow.

10
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:28,730
Maybe just first base.

11
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,020
Meredith.

12
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,640
I'm only opening one box.

13
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:42,310
The plan was not to open any.

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,880
The plan was to take your
mom's boxes up to the attic.

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,070
look. It's anatomy jane.

16
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,340
for a surgeon,every
patient is a battlefield.

17
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,530
I'll never have my own office.

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,500
They're our terrain,where
we advance,retreat...

19
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,360
try to remove all the land mines.

20
00:00:57,590 --> 00:00:59,740
And she still has her little twosh.

21
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,880
-Her what?
-Anatomy jane had detachable organs.

22
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,760
And I could never remember their
real names,so I made up names.

23
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:11,720
Like,the twosh was next to the chubbel,and
that was connected to the slivvy.

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,960
,And look. It's the jelly pouch.

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,450
The jelly pouch. My favorite.

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,710
Still can't get enough
of the jelly pouch.

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:22,110
And just when you think you've won
the battle,made the world safe again...

28
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,100
Along comes another land mine.

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,650
-So are we screwing other people or not?
-What?

30
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:31,710
I just want to know if you're gonna go
off and screw o'malley or some other loser,

31
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:35,370
because then I don't have to cancel
my plans with the chick from peds.

32
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,820
you're an ass.

33
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,750
What?

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,800
-that was amazing.
-Yay.

35
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,400
It was for me,too.

36
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,250
-I mean,that was amazing.
-For me,too.

37
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,150
my whole life...

38
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,950
my whole adult life,I
have been with men.

39
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,790
And it always felt,you
know,fine,good,but...

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,630
I never...

41
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,890
I mean--I mean,I
did,but not...

42
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,080
not like this.

43
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,920
this is like needing glasses.

44
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,920
-um,I've blinded you?
-no.

45
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,350
When I was a kid,I would
get these headaches,

46
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,350
and I went to the doctor,and
they said that I needed glasses.

47
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,650
I didn't understand that.

48
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,430
It didn't make sense to me
because I could see fine.

49
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,390
And then I get the
glasses,and I put them on,

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:46,600
and I'm in the car on the way
home,and suddenly I yell...

51
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,260
because the big green blobs that I
had been staring at my whole life,

52
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,020
they weren't big green blobs.

53
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,100
they were leaves on trees.

54
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,990
I could see the leaves.

55
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,810
And I didn't even know
I was missing the leaves.

56
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,640
I didn't even know that
leaves existed,and then...

57
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,750
leaves.

58
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,860
You are glasses.

59
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,600
I am so gay.

60
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:21,820
I am so,so,so gay.

61
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,750
I am extremely gay.

62
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,610
I have to go.

63
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,420
Ah,gentlemen.

64
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,340
I want you to meet the new
head of trauma at seattle grace.

65
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,480
Major owen hunt,you remember
derek shepherd,mark sloan.

66
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,060
-He stole my patient.
-Mine,too.

67
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,960
Now you'll get a chance to steal mine.

68
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,330
-Looking forward to it.
-Ah,can't wait.

69
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,340
I just talked to a friend
of mine at the D.O.H.

70
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:02,300
Now that we have owen,we are being reclassified
as a level i trauma unit by the end of the month.

71
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,400
That explains it.

72
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,360
So my mom bought it
for me when I was 5...

73
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:09,180
which is a super creepy gift for
a 5 year old,but I kinda liked it.

74
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,550
Run!

75
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,390
Okay.

76
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,610
-what was that all about?
-I just saw owen.

77
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,140
Major owen hunt. You know,the guy
who pulled the icicle from my chest.

78
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:26,930
I thought he was in iraq.

79
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,800
Well,yeah,he was and now he's
here,I mean,at my hospital.

80
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,480
-Okay,so?
-So...

81
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,740
so we kissed.

82
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:35,010
I mean he kissed me.

83
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,950
It was stupid. It was nothing.
It was a stupid nothing.

84
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,120
But you don't think he thinks
it was a stupid nothing.

85
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,250
Well,I mean,he obviously likes me,and
now he's back. What's he doing back?

86
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,890
You don't think he quit
the military for you.

87
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,600
I mean,that would be severely
stalkery,but very romantic.

88
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,620
I'm not getting involved
with another attending.

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,650
Coast clear?

90
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,100
-You paged me,chief?
-Uh,yes,I did.

91
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:07,520
'Cause generally,when I'm paged to the helipad,
there's something landing on the helipad.

92
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,580
Yeah.

93
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,780
You pulled off a 12-person
domino surgery last week.

94
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,060
That's the kind of
thing we need every week.

95
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:18,080
It's also the kind of thing that shows me
that you're gonna be a great surgeon someday.

96
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,230
-Well,thank you,sir.
-It's not enough.

97
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:22,010
I don't want you to
be just great,miranda.

98
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,290
I want you to be the best,and if you're gonna succeed
me as the best general surgeon in this hospital,

99
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,810
you need to start now,today,which
means you need to be me.

100
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,640
U want to take point on
a surgery? Take point.

101
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,710
A problem comes up? Solve it.

102
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:35,960
Don't talk to me. Just do it.

103
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,230
Be me.

104
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,070
-Be you?
-Be me.

105
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,710
I could do that.

106
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:45,750
I don't know why you had to bring me
all the way up here to the-- that's why.

107
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,030
Lake washington med is sending over a
10-year-old girl with an abdominal leiomyosarcoma.

108
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:52,130
It's inoperable.

109
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,870
You're gonna have to put together a
team and come up with a plan to save her.

110
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,940
Save a girl with an inoperable tumor?

111
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:02,350
It isn't easy being me.

112
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,590
-what's wrong with you?
-What's wrong with me?

113
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,070
We've been sleeping together for
a week,and already,you're bored.

114
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,340
I'm hot and great in bed.
So what is wrong with you?

115
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,440
Look,I didn't say I s bored.

116
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,430
I just asked whether or not I
should keep sleeping with michelle.

117
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,360
I'm asking if you're all-in.

118
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,940
-What's so wrong with that?
-You're a barbarian.

119
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,470
How can I be all-in
with an actual barbarian?

120
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:25,400
Fine. Claudia in riology
thinks I have a hot ass.

121
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,890
I'll tap that next.

122
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,350
You do that.

123
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,560
Oh,lexie.Would
you mind pick--

124
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,340
lexie,I'm your roommate. You're
eventually gonna have to talk tme.

125
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,720
-I reject that supposition.
-I reject your rejection.

126
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:36,960
-And I ignore your rejection of my rejection.
-What?

127
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,400
-I don't reject you,george.
-Thank you.

128
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,100
Okay,two things-- you all
have a skills lab this morning.

129
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,920
It is mandatory. Dot even
think about trng to get out.

130
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,040
Second,one of you will not have
to go to the mandatory skills lab

131
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,710
because you will be assisting me in my efforts to
remove an inoperable tumor from a 10-year-old girl.

132
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,170
-I'll do it.
-Yono,u won'T.

133
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,570
You have a hundred delinquent charts.
You will do those after the lab.

134
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,340
Slacker.

135
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,500
How can you operate
on an inoperable tumor?

136
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:05,420
Karev is also out.

137
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,960
-What did I say?
-You doubted me.

138
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:09,020
Oh,I-I-I-don't
doubt you,Dr. Bailey.

139
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,800
-Yang is out,too.
-Why?

140
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,480
You weren't supportive of a fellow resident
who couldn't get his paperwork under control.

141
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:18,400
-What is that? Grey,is that anatomy jane?
-YeS.

142
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,460
With the 24 removable organs and the
optional parts to simulate pregnancy?

143
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,490
Yes. Does that mean I'm out,too?

144
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,480
No,that means you're in.

145
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,720
-Oh,that's not fair.
-yes!

146
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,950
Next time,you'll know to bring
in an ugly doll,won't you,stevens?

147
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,910
Dr. Yang,what exactly
happens in skills lab?

148
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:39,160
-Who e you?
-I'm your new intern. Ryan spalding.

149
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,110
Oh,I'm never gonna remember
that. You're,um,uh,4.2.

150
00:07:46,610 --> 00:07:48,110
Three,move.

151
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,160
-Is everything okay?
-Shut up. Don't move.

152
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:52,090
Hi,I'm Dr. Hunt.

153
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:55,750
Over the next few months,I will be teaching
you how to work quickly and efficiently

154
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,430
to keep someone alive in circumstances where the
safe bet is they're dead by the end of the hour.

155
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,090
Now does anyone have a problem
working with live tissue?

156
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,310
-live tissue?
-I don't know.

157
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,060
Anyone? Speak now.

158
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:07,370
In fact,leave now.

159
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,930
If not,I own you for
the rest of the day.

160
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,820
Good. Here we go.

161
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,260
each resident gets a
pig. Interns assist.

162
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,320
Hang on.

163
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,020
Go ahead.

164
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,200
Save their lives.

168
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,150
You're a monster.

169
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,930
They're under. They didn't feel
any pain. Ask the veterinarian.

170
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,720
-You stabbed them.
-So we can save them.

171
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,480
We can practice on--on
surgical mannequins.

172
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,810
We can learn to do the exact same stuff.

173
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,240
-Does that mean you're out?
-Yeah,I'm out.

174
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:11,080
In that case,who wants two pigs?

175
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,160
tori begler,age 10.

176
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,480
Tori has an abdominal leiomyosarcoma.

177
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:25,010
The tumor is wrapped around her celiac artery,her
splenic artery and her left gastric artery.

178
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:27,190
It is considered unresectable.

179
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,350
Did you understand a word of that,tori?

180
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,710
Not really.

181
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,090
grey.

182
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,650
This is anatomy jane.

183
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,150
She's kinda funny looking.

184
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,500
She is funny looking,but
she's very helpful.

185
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,560
So the tumor...

186
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,800
is way down here in your belly.

187
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:51,820
It's hard to get at because
it's underneath all these organs.

188
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,740
Hard,but not impossible,right?

189
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,180
We're gonna try everything we can.

190
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,720
Everything you can should
include your cardiothoracic gal.

191
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,340
Stewart at seattle pres said the
vasculature is the big problem,

192
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:06,300
and you stole the best
cardiovascular surgeon he's ever had.

193
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,250
If she's not on tori's team,we're
leaving and going to san francisco.

194
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,210
Fudge? It's homemade.

195
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,660
-I love this hospital.
-Yeah,enough small talk. Come on.

196
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,020
-More lessons?
-No,no lessons. Just sex.

197
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,630
Nothing fancy. Just plain old
missionary,boy/girl,penis/vagina sex.

198
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:29,650
Hey,hey,I mean it. No
dirty talk. No erica talk.

199
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,490
No talk. Just grunting and grinding.

200
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,220
-Now who's talking dirty?
-Shut up.

201
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:37,040
-What's this about?
-I'm testing a theory.

202
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,290
Good. That looks good.

203
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,650
are you petting the pig?

204
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,620
I-I was-- stop
pettinghe pig.

205
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,230
You seem to be spending a lot of te on
that anastamosis. What was your name again?

206
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,470
Yang. Cristina yang.

207
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,050
Right. Come take a
look at this guy's pig.

208
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,580
-O'malley?
-Oh,this is gonna be good.

209
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,440
Here,make way for Dr. Yang.

210
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,670
you see what he did? He stopped the bleeding,and
then he moved on to his liver lacerations.

211
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:09,620
Yes,but sloppy work can
lead to complications.

212
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,840
Two days from now when this
pig starts vomiting blood,

213
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,990
o'malley's gonna wish he'd
been a little more thorough.

214
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:16,810
He can come back later and make
things pretty when his pig is stable.

215
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,860
Meanwhile,your pig is getting
acidotic and hypothermic.

216
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,090
If this was some scrawny kid
instead of a pig,he'd be dead by now.

217
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,010
Quick and dirty,cristine.

218
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,330
"A. " Cristina.

219
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,190
Okay,let's guide the
catheter into the celiac axis.

220
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,050
Turning on the fluoro.

221
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,100
What the... uh,excuse me a second.

222
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,010
uh,hello. You can't be in here.

223
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,160
That's my uncle pat and aunt jean.

224
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:44,480
They like to make sure
I don't get lonely.

225
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,170
She's not lonely. Dr. Grey
and I are very entertaining.

226
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,020
uh,uh,okay,fine. Um,they
have to stay in there,though.

227
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,340
There's radiation in here.

228
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,740
All right,let's,uh,injectye.

229
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,880
is everything okay?

230
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,910
Uh,it--it's
fine.

231
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,280
Owen hunt is a
murdering,sadistic bastard.

232
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,110
Let me guess. First wet lab?

233
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,090
He's stabbing pigs,defenseless pigs.

234
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,480
Or as he likes to call them,"live tissue,"
because god forbid you should call them animals.

235
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,460
Well,he is the new
head of trauma,stevens.

236
00:12:35,530 --> 00:12:38,060
It may not be ideal,but if that's how
he does things,you should roll with it.

237
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,510
We don't need live subjects.

238
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:40,750
What happened to first do no harm?

239
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,350
Th's not just about humans.
That's about all living things.

240
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,920
Actually,I think it's just about humans.

241
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,840
I'm saying this to you as my
roommate and not my attending.

242
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,690
You disgust me.

243
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,730
Damn it.

244
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,510
What,it wasn't good for you? impossible.

245
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,280
It's not that it wasn't good.

246
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:03,510
it's that it was.

247
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,680
A "thank you" would've been nice.

248
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,820
You paged me?

249
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,330
I've got a 10-year-old girl with a tumor wrapped
around her aorta. I'm putting together a team.

250
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,350
This is her angio?

251
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,790
She just-- this thing is
wrapped around fiveajor arteries.

252
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:19,540
It's bad,but I've got a couple of ideas.

253
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,180
Good for you. Try them on
someone who might actually live.

254
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:27,330
I-I admit,it doesn't look great,but
her family mentioned you by name,

255
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,170
so I thought-- that's
nice,but I really don't care.

256
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,100
Well,I do.

257
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:36,170
Don't get emotional,bailey. No one
likes a girl who gets emotional.

258
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,360
Still... I'd like you on my team.

259
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,630
I'm sorry about this,little
guy. It must have been awful.

260
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:52,780
One day,you're at some beautiful farm out
in the country breathing in the fresh air,

261
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:56,310
lounging in the mud with all your
friends,and next thing you know,

262
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,550
you're sedated and
stabbed in some skills lab.

263
00:13:58,630 --> 00:13:59,990
***

264
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,230
*** ***

265
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,460
-trauma?
-Multiple M.V.C. Six incoming.

266
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,600
You,lab's over. Do your charts.

267
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,230
-What about my pig?
-She's got it.

268
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,750
-What?
-You're staying here.

269
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:13,180
Wait,with a half-dozen crash
victims coming into the pit?

270
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:15,240
You got four struggling
victims right here.

271
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,880
-Keep them alive.
-Wait,all of them?

272
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,750
Karev gets to work on mangled people,and
I'm stuck with 300 pounds of bacon?

273
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,970
Live bacon,and it better
be that way when I get back.

274
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,020
35-year-old backseat passenger. Forehead
versus window,and the window won.

275
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,820
Also has second-degree burns on the
left side. Vitals stable en route.

276
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,930
Trauma one. What do yogot?

277
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:37,060
Charles hit,46,positive ecchymosis over
abdomen. Last B.P.In the field-- 96 over 68.

278
00:14:37,090 --> 00:14:38,590
-Do you know how to use a trauma ultrasound?
-Yes.

279
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,020
In that case,he's all
yours in trauma two.

280
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,370
What do you-- can I
help you gentlemen?

281
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:43,140
Dr. Karev paged us.

282
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,560
Well,he shouldn't have.
We got it covered. Thanks.

283
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:46,950
You have a head injury and burns,so
I don't think you have it covered.

284
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,370
-Karev,are you a doctor?
-Uh,yes,sir.

285
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:51,000
-Are you capable of assessing a patient's injuries?
-Yep.

286
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,170
Like I said,we got it covered.

287
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,960
You know what? We're here. Why
don't you let us just dive in?

288
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:56,510
Appreciate the offer,shepherd,but I want my
residents to learn how to deal with trauma.

289
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,860
They're not gonna learn as much
or as fast if they stand back

290
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:02,270
and watch attendings do
it,unss that attending is me.

291
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:07,220
three other hospitals have
already sent them away,

292
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:09,500
and if we were smart,we
would do the same thing.

293
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,040
What is the matter with you?

294
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,260
we can try and cut around the stomach.

295
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,760
No,the only way to do that
is to actually take it out.

296
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,710
They've done ex vivo autotransplants.

297
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,770
Yeah,with livers an

298
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,660
so why don't we take out
the stomach and the kidneys?

299
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:26,400
oh,yeah,that'd be great
if you wanted to kill her.

300
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:29,280
We're talking about two completely
different blood supplies here.

301
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,660
So,no,not a good idea,grey.

302
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,220
Who are those people?

303
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,560
Uh,that's tori's dad randy and his brother patand
pat's wife jean and tori's brother david and

304
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:45,240
-
- why are they staring at us,Dr. Bailey?

305
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,450
I don't think they're
staring at us,chief.

306
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:51,140
I think they're just
waiting,seeing if we have any news.

307
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:54,200
Look,try and come up with
something before I get back.

308
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:57,760
close the blinds,grey.

309
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,440
-you paged me?
-Rambo is completely out of control.

310
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,680
-Excuse me?
-Hunt.

311
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,810
He kicked me out of my own E.R.

312
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,360
-Did he kill somebody?
-Not yet.

313
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,670
-Then call me when he does.
-Richard.

314
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:11,240
I don't have time for it,shep.

315
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:16,170
I have a dying 10 ye old and a team of doctors who
can't stop bickering long engh to solve a problem,

316
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,010
except for your girlfriend,who's
moesnterted playing with a doll.

317
00:16:19,090 --> 00:16:19,810
Anatomy jane?

318
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,460
She dragged that thing all around
the hospital when she was 5 years old,

319
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,470
and let me tell you,it
was cuter in a child.

320
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,410
-any luck?
-what do you think?

321
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,430
Look,I know you want to
be number one,richard,

322
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:36,160
but we can't take in every
charity case that comes along.

323
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,070
It is a huge waste of resources.

324
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,410
It's your call,Dr. Bailey.

325
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,130
Grey,put that away. This isn't playtime.

326
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,910
I'm not playing. I'm thinking.

327
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:51,350
What if we just took out each of the organs
where the tumor interferes with the blood supply?

328
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:55,100
By the time you clamp off the aorta,you
run the risk of damaging the other organs.

329
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,880
Even if you take them out one by one?

330
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,350
You don't have the time,grey.

331
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,250
What about if we made the time?

332
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:08,040
Dr. Bailey,let's throw
some stuff up on the board.

333
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,310
C.T. Showed a subdural
hematoma. Should I book an O.R.?

334
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,440
First things first. His scalp is
bleeding like stink. What do you do next?

335
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:19,060
-Normally,I'd page shepherd.
-Shepherd's not here.

336
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,550
What do you do to stop the bleeding?

337
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,030
-Suture the laceration,tie off the bleeders.
-That'll take two hours.

338
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,740
What would you use in this
room to take care of this?

339
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,530
-staples?
-It's his forehead. You...

340
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,100
you want this guy to look like
frankenstein for the rest of his life?

341
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,690
-Skin glue.
-Excellent,karev.

342
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:35,590
Clean it,close it,and stick
a pressure dressing over it.

343
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:38,420
How are you feeling,mister,uh,hiott?

344
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,540
Not too good.

345
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,090
How are we gonna make
Mr. Hiott feel better?

346
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,250
The ultrasound showed free fluid.

347
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,930
We'll get him to a C.T. To confirm,but
he's pretty much O.R. Bound.

348
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,860
Excellent. Is that tetanus?

349
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:51,380
You know who you have to thank for the
invention of the tetanus shot,stevens? Horses.

350
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:54,480
The first experiments--
done on horses.

351
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,670
You want to take out all of her abdominal
organs-- intestine,stomach,everything?

352
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,640
-all at once?
-That's right.

353
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:06,930
We'll put the organs on ice
while we dissect out the tumor,

354
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:11,250
then reconnect the vessels using synthetic
grafts and put the organs back in.

355
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,850
Why di't graham or fleisher over
at lake washington suggest this?

356
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,190
They're a couple of smarties.

357
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,270
Probably because it's
never been done before.

358
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,660
it is extremely risky. There are any
number of things that could go wrong.

359
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,840
I-I don't know,randy. Maybe
we should try more chemo.

360
00:18:28,970 --> 00:18:32,720
Uh,with all due respect,Mrs. Begler,I
don't think there's time for that.

361
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,190
Is it gonna save her life?

362
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,940
It's your best shot...

363
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,880
your only shot.

364
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,620
-Then do it.
-okay.

365
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:52,990
Dr. Bailey... um,I'm not a vet.

366
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:57,990
And while I can appreciate the value of practicing
technique on live tissue,there's a multiple M.V.C.

367
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,710
In the pit,and my education would be
far better served practicing on humans.

368
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,460
-Well,w--who's babysitting the
pigs right now? -My interns.

369
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,230
Did major hunt order the interns
to babysit the pigs or you?

370
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,120
-That's not the point.
-Well,make it the point.

371
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,950
I don't have time for this. I'm about
to take six organs out of a person.

372
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,980
Well,see? That--that-- that's
not fair. I'm not Dr. Doolittle.

373
00:19:15,270 --> 00:19:18,670
The zebras and the elephants are
thanking their lucky stars for that.

374
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,320
I have a question.

375
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,530
Why aren't we taking out the kidney
since the left renal artery is involved?

376
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,730
Because we can remove the tumor
without doing that,so why bother?

377
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:36,100
-I have another question.
-Yes?

378
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,320
Why can't you look at me?

379
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,290
What?

380
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:45,790
You can't look at me. You haven't
been able to look at me all day.

381
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,970
I think you're imagining things.

382
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:52,680
I don't think I am.
But,hey,if you say so.

383
00:19:52,850 --> 00:19:54,070
I do.

384
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,730
I say so.

385
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:58,060
So instead of worrying about
whether or not I'm looking at you,

386
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:02,640
maybe you should concentrate on saving the
10-year-old girl that we're about to eviscerate.

387
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,920
uh,grey,why do we
dissect down in quadrants?

388
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,800
Uhso we can get a good luck at the vessels to
make sure we have enough for reconstruction.

389
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:19,030
Very good.

390
00:20:19,170 --> 00:20:20,730
a little suction right in here,please.

391
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,380
Mr. Begler is on the phone.

392
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,170
O.R. Desk wants to know if
they can put him through.

393
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,280
-no.
-He's pretty insistent.

394
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,590
And I'm pretty busy.

395
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,030
If you could hold this up a
little bit higher,Dr. Grey.

396
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:33,880
I want to make sure
to avoid-- that.

397
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,370
Okay,let's get some clamps.

398
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,110
Another clamp,pleas

399
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,130
right there.

400
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,620
Let's hang another bag of blood.

401
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,670
You betterope the aorta
is not that friable,

402
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:46,300
otherwise,all the blood in
the world won't save this girl.

403
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:52,580
- ryan,what's reggie's pulse?
- 69.

404
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,820
Really?'Cause wilbur's at 102,and
I'm pretty sure that's bad.

405
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,660
Babe's like an ox.Hers is 52.

406
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,280
hey,no cute names.

407
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
They're not pets.They're subjects.

408
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,320
It's not our job to
get all affectionate.

409
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:05,490
It's our job to keep them alive...

410
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:10,650
so the attending who somehow thinks we're incapable
can choke on his words at the end of the day.

411
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,830
So I don't want to hear wilbur or babe.

412
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:18,350
You want to call them something,call
them sausage or prosciutto.

413
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,890
wilbur's crashing.

414
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,920
What?What did you do?

415
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:26,350
I don't--I don't-- I gotta
reopen that thoracotomy.

416
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,370
- Uh,pull that chest tray back over here.
- Yeah.

417
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,660
- Dr. Bailey.
- Removing the organs on three.

418
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:39,090
One... twO... three.

419
00:21:40,850 --> 00:21:42,660
very good.

420
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,160
All right.

421
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,280
Let me have it.

422
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:57,930
I'll need medium and large vessel
loops to dissect out the tumor.

423
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,320
Mr. Begler again.

424
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:00,790
He wants to talk to
you about his daughter.

425
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,190
- Well,I'm pretty busy right now.
- I already told him that.

426
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,510
- Well,tell him again.
- I've told him 18 times.

427
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,600
Chief,you need to go talk to them.

428
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,190
Hey,you did put me in charge.

429
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,910
I'll be back.

430
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,970
What the hell?

431
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,400
Look at this crap.

432
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,990
Is that glue?

433
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,610
You used skin glue?

434
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:25,470
Dr. Hunt wanted to get him
outta there pretty quick.

435
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:30,200
Yeah,well,because Dr. Hunt didn't have u
revise the wound,he could lose half his face.

436
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,910
You can't rotate a flap,you
call someone who can.

437
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,810
Well,he says the E.R. Is like being
in the field.You use what's available.

438
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,970
What,uh,qualifies us as a war
zone,karev,our undermanned gift shop,

439
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,390
the lukewarm drinks
from the coffee cart?

440
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,880
He's a meatballer.What do you expect?

441
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,550
Meatballer?Trauma guys.They
just slap it together.

442
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,040
any available I.V.Nurse...

443
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:51,380
Dr. Webber,how's tori?

444
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,560
She's stable.

445
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,000
We're removing the tumor right now.

446
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,640
Actually,I should be in there
to help,but I'm out here instead.

447
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,820
I just needed an update.

448
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,250
It's not important that you
get an update right now,sir.

449
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:03,790
What's important is the best doctors we have
in this hospital are focused on your daughter.

450
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:05,220
Calls don't help us focus.

451
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,710
Interruptions don't help us focus.

452
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,820
I'm sorry.I know we have
been underfoot sometimes.

453
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,810
But we have been to a lot of hospitals.

454
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,450
And hospitals are not easy
places to get information.

455
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,800
In fact,a lot of times,it's impossible to even get a doctor
to talk to you or to get the doctors to talk to each other.

456
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:26,280
And I don't know if it's neglect or their
egos getting in the way,and I don't care.

457
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:28,150
We're just trying to take
care of our little girl.

458
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,030
She's 10,she's scared and she's sick.

459
00:23:32,650 --> 00:23:34,550
We're doing whatever we can.

460
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,130
Don't ever stop taking
care of her like that.

461
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,650
Steven have you ever
used a G.I.A. Stapler?

462
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:49,640
No,but I'm ready.I can handle it.

463
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:52,010
Answer me three
questions,and I'll let you.

464
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,620
Okay.

465
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:56,010
Question
one--polio vaccine.

466
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,780
Which animal do you
have to thank for that?

467
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:58,810
Is this reallysaecesry?

468
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,590
Only if you want to use that stapler.

469
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,040
flipper babies.

470
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:04,480
- What?
- Flipper babies.

471
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:10,060
10,000 babies were born with birth defects in the
1950s because their pregnant mothers took thalidomide,

472
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:13,340
first developed on guinea pigs.The
guinea pigs didn't have any side effects.

473
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,260
Your point?

474
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:18,840
My point is that humans and animals have different
physiologies,they have different reactions.

475
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:21,310
They can have different
reactions.Doesn't mean that they will.

476
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,480
Tell that to those 10,000
babies and their mothers.

477
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:28,050
So the polio vaccine--developed
using mice and monkeys.

478
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,320
You can keep your
stapler.It's not worth it.

479
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,580
Give me the status on reggie and paddy.

480
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,530
Reggie's fine.

481
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,130
Paddy's pulse ox is low but stable.

482
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:38,670
- And babe?
- Holding steady.

483
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,480
I thought we weren't
supposed to give them names.

484
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,980
I could give them numbers,but then I'd
probably tell you three needs antibiotics

485
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:46,080
and find you shoving
a needle in grey's ass.

486
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:48,660
His vitals are getting worse.Damn it.

487
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:50,320
Uh,did you check his lung again?

488
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,570
I already took out an entire lobe.

489
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,420
- What about his descending aorta?
- You know what?Just can it,lexopedia.

490
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,090
I've tried everything.

491
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:57,290
pulseless.Uh,that's it.

492
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,310
- We need to get more exposure.
- You're opening him up more?

493
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,730
I need everyone's help.

494
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,890
Stem to stern.

495
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:04,130
What--what if
he can't take it?

496
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,700
- You could--you could kill
him.- Don't get emotional.

497
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,200
Just get ready to start
massaging his heart.

498
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,500
Scalpel.

499
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,040
Dr. Bailey,can you dissect down anymore?

500
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,840
There's nothing to dissect.

501
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,130
There's barely any artery left.

502
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,700
What about if we extend
the gore-tex graft?

503
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,410
No,what's leftis too friable.

504
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:25,410
So we can't reconnect
the organs to the vessels?

505
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,230
Not at this moment,no.

506
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:30,780
But if we can't reconnect the organs,they
won't reperfuse and they'll just die.

507
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,220
Yes,they will.

508
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:33,550
Is it too late for a transplant?

509
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,600
Well,we'd have to find six
good o ans in about eight hours.

510
00:25:37,690 --> 00:25:38,880
It's too late for a transplant.

511
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,280
And a gold star for grey.

512
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,370
we could try to put in more gore-tex.

513
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,190
Oh,put even more
synthetic material in her?

514
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,600
What about a saphenous vein graft?

515
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,990
No,she's already getting acidotic.

516
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,570
That sort of thing has to be preplanned.

517
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:59,090
Yeah,so what's your idea?

518
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:01,850
- Excuse me?
- I mean,you're good at shooting down every idea we come up with.

519
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:06,350
- What's yours?
- It was my idea not to do this in the first place,Dr. Bailey.

520
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,540
Yeah,you made that very
clear every chance you got.

521
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:10,890
Shut up.

522
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:13,070
I don't care who had what idea when.

523
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,210
Get over yourselves.

524
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,050
Shut up and talk to each other.

525
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,000
what about...

526
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,430
using...

527
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,870
human umbilical vein?

528
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,390
I mean,ready to go,already heparinized.

529
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,680
Okay.

530
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:32,780
I like it.

531
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,010
Erica,what do you think?

532
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:35,450
It could work.

533
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,520
It's Dr. Bailey's call.

534
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,340
If she wants to do it...

535
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:40,930
I do.

536
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,270
In that case,let's do it.

537
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,190
Nice work on the valve.

538
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,630
First developed in
pigs,but more recently cows.

539
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:52,170
Aryou done beating me up for the day?

540
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,650
- Because I'd like to go home.
- I was just trying to teach you.

541
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,980
You want to teach us?

542
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:01,480
Take us to the simulab with the plastic guys who have heart
rates anblood pressure and croak when you nick an artery.

543
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,620
Until you apply scalpel to skin,stevens,you're
just going through the motions.

544
00:27:04,670 --> 00:27:07,010
That attitude,that's from before.

545
00:27:07,050 --> 00:27:08,270
We have the technology now.

546
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:09,400
We don't have to torture live creatures.

547
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,300
No,you don't get to
accuse me of torture.

548
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,730
Those animals felt no pain.

549
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,100
You don't know that.

550
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,950
You don't know that.

551
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,580
You don't know what they felt.

552
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,710
You don't know how scared they re.

553
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,940
Als animare sensitive
and intelligent creatures.

554
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,740
And that is not me being
emotional,that is simply the truth.

555
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,780
You want me to learn from your methods?

556
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,180
You want me to learn anything from you?

557
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:33,860
Then don't stab pigs in front of me
and tell me that the sky isn't blue.

558
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:39,310
You are torturing god's creatures in an age where
we have the technology that no longer requires us to.

559
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,860
If you want to do that,go ahead,but don't
tell me I'm less of a doctor for walking away.

560
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,210
come on,wilbur,don't do this.

561
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,460
His heart's not filling.

562
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,460
No,uh,massage it with both
hands,like a-- like a heart sandwich.

563
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,840
Okay.

564
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:59,150
Good,good.

565
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,610
There.Right there.Stupid.

566
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:02,810
Look at that.

567
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,920
The knife went through his
diaphragm right into his spleen.

568
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,540
Okay,um,hand me those clamps.

569
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,970
we've got some blood pooling
the lower left quadrant.

570
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,610
Can anybody see where it's coming from?

571
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,960
Here.This graft.

572
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:15,730
Satinsky clamps and 4-0 prolene.

573
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,500
Scissors.

574
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,370
waiting,Dr. Bailey.

575
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,370
okay,this thing's coming out.

576
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,840
Still waiting,Dr. Bailey.

577
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:30,700
Okay.

578
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:31,720
Suction.

579
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,410
Clear it out.

580
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,370
Okay,release clamps.

581
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,700
hold on,hold on,hold on.

582
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,420
Right in here.

583
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,640
Still nothing.

584
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,850
no pulsation.

585
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:50,860
come on.

586
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:52,180
Come on.

587
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,040
Reperfusion complete.

588
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,760
Heart's beating on its own.

589
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,990
all right.

590
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,650
all right.

591
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,990
everyone,hell of a job.

592
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:20,830
I've known women to be upset because
they couldn't make it to the big finish.

593
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,390
Never had anything to do with me.

594
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:25,820
Usually something to
do with their anatomy.

595
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:30,430
The point is,I've never known a woman to be
upset because she could take a curtain call.

596
00:29:31,430 --> 00:29:33,270
You're a conundrum,torres.

597
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,480
Erica cried this morning...

598
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,440
in bed...

599
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,090
after sex.

600
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:42,930
That was a compliment...

601
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,330
for you.

602
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:46,140
The crying was a compliment.

603
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,610
It wasn't a compliment for me.

604
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:49,700
She was--it was-- she
was having a revelation.

605
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,360
She was having...

606
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,360
the sex is awesome with erica.

607
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,860
We've reached awesome,which is...

608
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,160
awesome.

609
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:02,670
Yes,but it's also awesome with you.

610
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:04,760
So what's the problem?

611
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:08,280
I guess I thought there
should be a difference...

612
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,300
between you and erica.

613
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,520
I mean,if I'M...

614
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:16,440
there should be a difference.

615
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,130
The difference between me and erica...

616
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,800
is that I know you had
sex with her 12 hours ago.

617
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,820
She doesn't know you had sex with
me,and that makes you a cheater.

618
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,940
Do you want to be a cheater?

619
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,750
'Cause I'm fine with it.

620
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,180
The question is,are you?

621
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,980
I'm gonna yell at the major general.

622
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,540
- You want to come?
- Hell yeah.

623
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,060
Be right there.

624
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,310
- Hey,torres.
- Hey.

625
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,370
Hunt,can I talk to you?

626
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:49,690
Sure.

627
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,160
Karev.

628
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,230
No,no,he can stay.

629
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,120
You want karev to hear how you screwed up the
flap on my head trauma,that's fine with me.

630
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,020
My job's to keep him
alive.That's what I did.

631
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,350
No,what you did was almost maim
a guy for the rest of his life.

632
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:01,360
You're lucky I saved the blood supply.

633
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,680
So what would you have done?

634
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:08,860
Well,you got a man with a deep scalp wound and two of the
best surgeons in the country standing 10 feet away from him.

635
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,400
I would've asked those
two surgeons to step in.

636
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,780
That's what I would've done.

637
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,110
I mean medically.

638
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,340
What would you have done
medically so I can do better?

639
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:20,410
Listen,I recognize there's different
ways of doing things,even the basics.

640
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,770
Over here,if someone appears
dead,you go to them first.

641
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:25,380
In iraq,if someone appears
dead,you don't go to them.

642
00:31:25,430 --> 00:31:31,220
This is day one for me,so if you think there's
a better way,then tell me,and I'll listen.

643
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,900
Ain,both of you,great job.

644
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,570
thank you.

645
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,250
is there a problem,Dr. Bailey?

646
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:48,100
I just find it hard to believe
you're accepting congratulations,

647
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,420
considering you didn't want to do
this operation in the first place.

648
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,790
And when you finly did do it,you
fought me every step of the way.

649
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,340
And yet,you still had a world-class
heart surgeon by your side.

650
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:06,420
You may be a fine surgeon-- god
knows I know that-- but not today.

651
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:15,170
Today you were a pain in the ass-- a
nay-saying,llying,consistently negativ pain in the ass.

652
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:21,110
At no point did you encourage me or do anything to make
me think this surgery could be anything but a failure.

653
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,400
And it wasn't just me.

654
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:26,020
You made it as hard as
humanly possible for all of us.

655
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,120
So,yeah,we did do a nice job today.

656
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:32,140
We did a great job today,but
that wasn't thanks to you.

657
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:38,950
That was thanks to me and the chief
and meredith grey and anatomy jane.

658
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,770
Babe is indestructible.

659
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,870
She lost a part of her liver and
small bowel,but she's been doing fine.

660
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,720
We had to cross-clamp wilbur's
aorta and massage his heart.

661
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:56,180
I couldn't locate the source of his bleeding until I found a
hole in his diaphragm and realized he had a spnic laceration.

662
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,300
He's a--he's
a fighter.

663
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,340
He's pulling through.

664
00:32:58,450 --> 00:33:03,410
Reggie had some oozing after his colon resection,but
we packed it,and he's been stable er since.

665
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:09,320
Uh,paddy almost bled out because his carotid was sliced right
through,but we put in a graft,and he's been stable ever since.

666
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,150
He's good as new.

667
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,270
That's good.

668
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,780
That's great work,all of you.

669
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,690
So,uh,put them out and make sure
that you write up all your work.

670
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:19,960
What do you mean,"put them out"?

671
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:22,140
Terminate
'em.Thpigs--kill 'em.

672
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,610
I'm not killing those pigs.

673
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,560
I spent the entire day
trying to keep them alive.

674
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:42,190
If you want them
dead,you do it yourself.

675
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,080
You sected half of a liver today.

676
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,820
You repaired a diaphragm
and did a splenectomy.

677
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:50,140
You grafted a severed artery and repaired
a lacerated bladder,performed a lobectomy.

678
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,400
And I understand you
even removed a tumor.

679
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,920
On paddy.His thyroid.

680
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:59,290
Do you have any idea how
much you just learned?

681
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,770
They'd be in pain.

682
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:04,890
Those are massive
injuries,months of recovery.

683
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,820
To keep them alive after
all that,that's not humane.

684
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,160
Seriously,you don't remember my name?

685
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,120
I remember your
name,but that was before.

686
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,230
This last tour,I was on
a forward surgical team.

687
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,010
We,uh...

688
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,170
treated combat casualties in the field.

689
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:31,200
You're mostly just looking to do damage ctrol-- sedate
'em,ventilate 'em,airlift 'em to baghdad,then get outta there.

690
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:37,820
Only this one time,we didn't get out fast enough
because we ended up in the middle of an R.P.G. Ambush.

691
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:43,800
There were 20 people in my
unit,including me,and 19 died.

692
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:47,910
And then I got discharged.So...

693
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,370
I'm not there anymore,in the before.

694
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,410
I knew your name in the before.

695
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,790
But now I'm living in the after.

696
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:18,190
- Erica
- you want to apologize to someone,apologize to bailey.

697
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,610
Thanks to you,I made her
life a living hell today.

698
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,250
I slept with mark sloan.

699
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:29,950
- If that's your idea of an apology,you seriously
- shut up.

700
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:35,280
you--you were-- you were crying
and--and--and seeing leaves.

701
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,300
And I wasn'T.

702
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,070
Okay?I-I may never see leaves.

703
00:35:41,290 --> 00:35:43,980
Or--or maybe I will see
leaves,but I will also see flowers.

704
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,700
I might be a whole forest
girl.I don't know yet.

705
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:50,080
But I-I do know that I want
to be with you,and to do that,

706
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,300
I have to at least tell you the truth,and
the truth is,I slept with mark sloan today.

707
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,630
Okay.

708
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,310
Twice,actually.

709
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,230
Okay.

710
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,100
you paged?

711
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,060
Yeah,um,yeah.How's tori?

712
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,580
- Oh,she's good.Stable.
- Yeah.

713
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,350
You weren't imagining things.

714
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,300
You used to run around here
with that doll all the time.

715
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,560
Took herverywhere-- the
cafeteria,the O.R. Gallery.

716
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,790
Tori's got a whole army.

717
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,750
You didn't have anyone.

718
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,350
Seeing anatomy jane...

719
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:45,560
reminded me of how much
I was to blame for that.

720
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,300
You're a living reminder
of every failure in my life.

721
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,900
That's not your fault.

722
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,740
And if I thought I'm sorry would hold
any meaning for you at all,I would say it.

723
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:02,890
I'd say it a thousand times a day.

724
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:06,340
Some wars are never over.

725
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:12,840
Some end in an uneasy truce.

726
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,600
I can't do it.

727
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,450
I know I'm supposed to,but...

728
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,170
they'll suffer.

729
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,610
Don't let them suffer.

730
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,740
So no more on call room,huh?

731
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,010
Afraid not.

732
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,020
That's,uh,that's too bad.

733
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,850
I guess I'll,uh,see you around.

734
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,680
You wanna get a drink?

735
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:58,620
Really?

736
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:02,980
Just 'cause we're not sleeping together
doesn't mean we can't hang out,be friends.

737
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:08,500
You're good for more than sex,mark.

738
00:38:08,730 --> 00:38:10,670
I would love to get a drink.

739
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,680
She's not gonna cry every time,right?

740
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,460
No,no,no.That passes.

741
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,200
some wars result...

742
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:31,390
in complete and total victory.

743
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,660
Sit.

744
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,260
Um,mac and cheese-- from
the box,not the freezer.

745
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,520
Some wars end with a peace offering.

746
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,140
There.

747
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,820
I named the pigs today.

748
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,640
I'm sorry,but I don't
know what that means.

749
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,870
I take things personally.

750
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,600
I get too emotional.

751
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,550
There's no place for it at work,not--not
with the pigs and not with you.

752
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,440
I'm sorry.

753
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:23,790
This is so much better
than the freezer kind.

754
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,980
I thought you were sleeping
with michelle tonight.

755
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,440
Or was it jackie?

756
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,800
- Iz
- I've had a hard day,alex,and a sad night.

757
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,150
So can you please just leave me alone?

758
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,090
- Izzie
- what?

759
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,230
I'm not good at this,all right?

760
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:49,580
I'm not good at--at relationships
or talking about stupid flings,and...

761
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:53,560
and you are,so maybe you could
teach me or something,you know?

762
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,760
Tell me what I did wrong.

763
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,990
You don't want us to see other people.

764
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:07,260
You don't want us to see other people,and
that'sow you tried to tell me...

765
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:12,240
by asking if it was cool
if you sewed michelle.

766
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,360
Laughing is not helping.

767
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,810
I'm sorry.

768
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,970
I'm sorry.

769
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,510
So you want lessons,huh?

770
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,930
I want lessons.

771
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,180
Mm-hmm.Okay.

772
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:29,140
You start with,isobel stevens,you
are staggeringly good in bed.

773
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:33,170
- you're amazing smart,wonderfully funny.
- Yeah.

774
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,700
And you care about animals.

775
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,750
- That's where I start?
- Yeah.

776
00:40:36,950 --> 00:40:40,000
And then you say,you
want to go steady with me?

777
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,970
That's what I would say if it was 1952.

778
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,630
Alex.

779
00:40:50,690 --> 00:40:51,690
Yeah.

780
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:53,680
You wanna go steady with me?

781
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,160
Mm,if that's what youant.

782
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,110
I mean,yeah,whatever.

783
00:40:58,250 --> 00:40:59,900
And some wars...

784
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,150
end in hope.

785
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,880
Oh,look.

786
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,070
WoI re this every day
to elementary school.

787
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,540
Nice.Your mom make that for you?

788
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,620
yeah,right.She probably got it at
the lost and found at the hospital.

789
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,730
Mer,you should do this one.

790
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,690
Is it more ugly hats?

791
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,720
- Another diary?
- More than one.

792
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,780
But all these wars are nothing...

793
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,940
- oh,god.
- I know.

794
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:29,750
Compared to the most
frightening war of all...
