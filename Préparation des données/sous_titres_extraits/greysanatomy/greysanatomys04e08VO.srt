1
00:00:00,085 --> 00:00:02,817
- <i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy...
- What's the matter with you?

2
00:00:02,996 --> 00:00:05,186
- I have to start dating.
- The sex with Izzie...

3
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:07,348
It's like she's trying too hard.

4
00:00:07,468 --> 00:00:09,008
- I got fired.
- What's the problem

5
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:11,198
- with you and your sister?
- She's not my sister.

6
00:00:11,318 --> 00:00:13,165
- We have the same dad.
- You killed my wife.

7
00:00:13,285 --> 00:00:16,042
- You took her from me.
- What do you need, scotch, vodka, gin?

8
00:00:16,162 --> 00:00:17,476
Just don't tell Meredith.

9
00:00:19,534 --> 00:00:22,360
<i>There comes a point in your life
when you're officially...</i>

10
00:00:22,588 --> 00:00:23,684
<i>An adult.</i>

11
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:27,238
<i>Suddenly you're old enough
to vote, drink...</i>

12
00:00:27,803 --> 00:00:30,227
<i>and engage
in other adult activities.</i>

13
00:00:30,443 --> 00:00:31,449
So...

14
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:32,972
Why the brain?

15
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,954
Why biology's Crown jewel?

16
00:00:35,074 --> 00:00:37,065
You mean
why did I go into neurosurgery?

17
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:39,016
Come on. Share.
Share with Sydney.

18
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:41,405
It was the headset

19
00:00:41,556 --> 00:00:44,283
with the magnifying glasses
that tipped the scale for me.

20
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,499
And the man has a sense of humor.

21
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,743
I like that.

22
00:00:48,863 --> 00:00:51,961
<i>Suddenly people expect you
to be responsible...</i>

23
00:00:52,444 --> 00:00:54,651
<i>Serious, a grown-up.</i>

24
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:58,487
Work stuff.

25
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:01,032
As if you didn't know.
I'll just be a sec.

26
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:06,264
I think they're on a date.

27
00:01:06,437 --> 00:01:08,043
That's definitely a date, right?

28
00:01:08,504 --> 00:01:09,715
Maybe she's dying.

29
00:01:09,894 --> 00:01:11,558
Is she dying? Is that why?

30
00:01:11,678 --> 00:01:14,102
Oh, come on. Grow up.
She's nice. She asked me out.

31
00:01:14,222 --> 00:01:16,785
Want me to fake a heart attack?
I do a great fake heart attack.

32
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:18,715
- Here she comes.
- Carry on.

33
00:01:18,835 --> 00:01:19,874
It's Sydney.

34
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,196
In the movies, when the handsome
but sensitive football player kisses

35
00:01:23,364 --> 00:01:26,031
the awkward, freaky girl
in front of the whole school...

36
00:01:26,208 --> 00:01:27,242
That girl is her.

37
00:01:27,362 --> 00:01:29,173
You are very awkward and freaky.

38
00:01:33,672 --> 00:01:34,940
<i>We get taller...</i>

39
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:37,860
<i>We get older.</i>

40
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,088
<i>But do we ever really grow up?</i>

41
00:01:46,404 --> 00:01:48,331
Do you know what kind
of batteries these take?

42
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,023
- Double "A."
- Is it really? Do you have one?

43
00:01:52,045 --> 00:01:54,252
I have some in my locker. Yeah.

44
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:00,997
We're avoiding them now.
It's come to that.

45
00:02:01,147 --> 00:02:02,649
Why are you avoiding Izzie?

46
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,238
It's like we're not us anymore.
Everything used to be so easy.

47
00:02:06,358 --> 00:02:09,482
Talking at least used to be easy.
Now, we can't even talk anymore.

48
00:02:11,378 --> 00:02:14,038
Oh, Derek went on a date
with Sydney Heron last night.

49
00:02:14,158 --> 00:02:17,097
It was probably a fake date to make me
think he's healthy and moving on.

50
00:02:17,217 --> 00:02:18,920
Do you think
he's healthy and moving on?

51
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,825
- Can we just take the stairs?
- Okay.

52
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:28,749
Bailey. I, uh...

53
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:30,896
Just, uh, I wanted to congratulate you.

54
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,868
I'm sorry if things got...

55
00:02:32,988 --> 00:02:34,584
You deserve the job.

56
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:35,819
Does she ever...

57
00:02:35,942 --> 00:02:37,773
Come here, new chief resident. Huh?

58
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,439
- Someone deserves a big hug.
- Come on, Sydney.

59
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:43,080
Well, I admit,
I'm a wee bit jealous.

60
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,025
But the chief has made his decision,
and I will abide by it.

61
00:02:46,357 --> 00:02:47,399
Oh, Callie...

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,742
- I'm, uh, I'm so sorry.
- I'm fine with it.

63
00:02:50,865 --> 00:02:53,015
Oh, good.
We're being a brave soldier.

64
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,658
No, really. I'm fine with it.

65
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,233
Let's not spoil this moment
for Miranda. Okay?

66
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,200
All right, listen up...

67
00:03:02,524 --> 00:03:06,214
I have nothing but respect
for the job done by Dr. Torres,

68
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,807
but things are gonna be
different from here on in.

69
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:12,171
Things are totally weird between us.
We can't hold a normal conversation.

70
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,879
This will be a professional environment.

71
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:17,785
So your love lives,
your hopes and dreams,

72
00:03:17,905 --> 00:03:19,529
the little joys and tragedies

73
00:03:19,649 --> 00:03:22,412
that make you who you are,
have no place in my hospital.

74
00:03:22,532 --> 00:03:25,062
He's acting like a total stranger,
like I don't even know him.

75
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:27,111
The locker room
is for changing,

76
00:03:27,231 --> 00:03:28,282
not for crying.

77
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:30,655
The on-call room is for napping,

78
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:33,171
not for anything
that requires a locked door.

79
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,324
Oh, my god. Don't even get me
started on the sex. It is just tragic.

80
00:03:36,493 --> 00:03:39,169
- It's like...
- Stevens, did you hear a word I said?

81
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:43,450
Grow up, I believe, is my point.

82
00:03:44,384 --> 00:03:48,215
Dr. Bailey, can you make sure
I stay on Dr. Hahn's cardio service?

83
00:03:48,378 --> 00:03:49,518
Already done.

84
00:03:49,638 --> 00:03:50,804
But if you piss her off

85
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:53,920
or mess up or in any way embarrass me,
that's it, no more chances.

86
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,716
Thank you. I will be
the best resident she's ever had.

87
00:03:56,865 --> 00:03:59,506
No, Yang, I will be the best
resident she's ever had.

88
00:03:59,626 --> 00:04:01,598
Yes, right second to you.

89
00:04:01,772 --> 00:04:03,584
His incision is healing nicely.

90
00:04:03,781 --> 00:04:06,232
No erythema or purulent discharge.

91
00:04:06,357 --> 00:04:08,501
He'll be monitored,
we'll try weaning him off the drip

92
00:04:08,621 --> 00:04:09,956
once his meds are maximized.

93
00:04:10,076 --> 00:04:12,594
After discharge, we expect him
to follow up in the cardiac clinic.

94
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:16,288
There are four other people here, Yang.
How about letting one of them talk?

95
00:04:21,093 --> 00:04:24,128
Mr. Talbot's cardiomyopathy
is unusually complicated, that's all.

96
00:04:24,248 --> 00:04:27,081
You know, you could take
a cue from Dr. Stevens.

97
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:29,963
She knows what's going on with
her patients, and she's inclusive.

98
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,458
- What do we got?
- High school bus crash.

99
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:37,348
Bunch of kids just came in.
We got more on the way.

100
00:04:37,712 --> 00:04:40,071
Tricia Hale,17, vital signs stable.

101
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:42,077
Sustained a large facial laceration,

102
00:04:42,197 --> 00:04:44,969
trauma to the buttock area and
an open fracture to the lower right leg.

103
00:04:45,089 --> 00:04:46,228
Okay, trauma room two.

104
00:04:46,348 --> 00:04:48,597
It's still bleeding.
My face is still bleeding.

105
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,247
We'll get to that in a minute, OK?

106
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:52,766
We? No, try the head
of plastic surgery.

107
00:04:52,954 --> 00:04:54,290
No one is touching my face

108
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,765
until I've spoken to the head
of plastic surgery. No one.

109
00:04:56,885 --> 00:04:59,347
34-year-old passenger Marcus King,

110
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,290
no complaints except
deep cuts on his left arm.

111
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:03,990
Stable on route.

112
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:06,557
Listen, I'm fine.
Please help the kids first.

113
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:08,463
They're being taken care of.
What happened?

114
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:10,694
I was taking the kids
on a tour of colleges.

115
00:05:10,814 --> 00:05:11,980
We're from California.

116
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,093
The bus slid down an embankment.

117
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,584
One, two, three.

118
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:20,073
Mandi?

119
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,219
Mandi!

120
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,050
Marcus?

121
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,084
- What's your name?
- Danny.

122
00:05:33,497 --> 00:05:36,596
Hey, Danny, I'm gonna take this off
so I can have a look, okay?

123
00:05:50,937 --> 00:05:52,815
Man, high school really does suck.

124
00:05:58,363 --> 00:06:01,810
It was that asshat sully
and his stupid friends!

125
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:04,554
The driver kept turning around,
telling them to shut up.

126
00:06:04,674 --> 00:06:07,110
I'm just drawing a logo,
and suddenly I'm upside-down.

127
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,988
The pencil went all the way in his eye.

128
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:10,113
I can see that.

129
00:06:10,235 --> 00:06:12,370
- Should I call his parents?
- Let us do that.

130
00:06:12,503 --> 00:06:15,179
Sully and those jerks should be in jail.
You should be calling the police,

131
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,593
- not my parents.
- You need to not think about those kid.

132
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:20,164
You'll be out of high school soon.
You never have to see 'em again.

133
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:22,265
- I still gotta finish.
- You need to calm down.

134
00:06:22,387 --> 00:06:24,990
When you raise your voice and get upset,
your blood pressure shoots up,

135
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:27,467
you could lose your eye.
I need you to stay calm.

136
00:06:28,312 --> 00:06:29,472
I'll try.

137
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:32,812
Listen, I really can't feel
what you're doing.

138
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:35,052
But I hope you're not leaving
a big, old' scar.

139
00:06:35,907 --> 00:06:38,219
No, no. No, no.

140
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,258
Just a few little stitches.
I do stitches all the time, so.

141
00:06:42,378 --> 00:06:44,127
Do you want me to take over, Dr. Bailey?

142
00:06:44,247 --> 00:06:46,560
No, no.
I do stitches all the time, O'Malley.

143
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,024
I just thought with all the more
serious injuries coming in,

144
00:06:49,144 --> 00:06:51,482
- you'd want me to take over.
- I'm fine here.

145
00:06:51,887 --> 00:06:53,174
You're not the boss of me.

146
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:56,157
Actually, I'm the boss of him,
if you want to know.

147
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:57,808
I'm the chief resident.

148
00:06:58,071 --> 00:06:59,263
- What?
- Yeah.

149
00:06:59,967 --> 00:07:01,545
Oh, Mandi.

150
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,626
You know something?
I'm not surprised.

151
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:05,808
Did you know we went
to high school together?

152
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:07,061
- Really?
- Yeah.

153
00:07:07,182 --> 00:07:09,276
And this girl right here,
she is a genius.

154
00:07:09,398 --> 00:07:11,060
Used to help me with all my homework.

155
00:07:11,382 --> 00:07:14,311
Just a few papers. that's all.

156
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,237
Dr. Bailey...

157
00:07:16,357 --> 00:07:18,581
- I do stitches all the time.
- I know,

158
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:21,772
- but you might want to take a listen.
- Something wrong with my ticker?

159
00:07:34,403 --> 00:07:37,427
Um, part of your heart may be

160
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:39,593
working overtime.

161
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:41,098
So, I, uh...

162
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:43,868
will get his E.K.G.
and page Hahn.

163
00:07:44,045 --> 00:07:45,510
Will you finish the sutures?

164
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:48,186
You can't finish this?

165
00:07:51,065 --> 00:07:52,615
I... Yes.

166
00:07:52,943 --> 00:07:54,324
I can do it. Sure.

167
00:07:54,953 --> 00:07:56,906
I'll do it.
You go get Hahn.

168
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:00,661
Okay.

169
00:08:00,977 --> 00:08:02,573
You better be able to fix my face.

170
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:05,005
I have pom statewides in a month.

171
00:08:05,163 --> 00:08:07,373
- You're a cheerleader?
- I'm a pom.

172
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,014
Cheerleaders just jump around.

173
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:10,413
Poms are dancers.

174
00:08:12,855 --> 00:08:14,198
I was on the football team.

175
00:08:14,321 --> 00:08:16,706
I'm not sure you're gonna be
dancing in the next month.

176
00:08:16,837 --> 00:08:17,922
You better be lying.

177
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:20,719
Not lying. You have very serious
knee and leg fractures,

178
00:08:20,897 --> 00:08:22,643
not to mention a cracked coccyx.

179
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:24,217
What the hell is that?

180
00:08:24,495 --> 00:08:26,336
That's the bone
at the bottom of your spine.

181
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:29,857
- The bottom of your bottom.
- My ass?

182
00:08:30,178 --> 00:08:31,258
I broke my ass?

183
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,967
That's one way to look at it.

184
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:34,609
Don't look at it.

185
00:08:34,872 --> 00:08:36,262
You're gonna need surgery.

186
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,088
Good news is that we'll put you under
so we can fix the bones

187
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,640
and Dr. Sloan can fix your face
all at the same time.

188
00:08:42,465 --> 00:08:43,657
You better be good.

189
00:08:44,361 --> 00:08:47,892
Baby, you're not gonna find
anybody better than me.

190
00:08:51,511 --> 00:08:54,037
Oh, my god. Hot cheerleader ass.

191
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:57,655
Take a cue from Stevens.

192
00:08:57,775 --> 00:08:59,756
From Izzie Stevens. Seriously?

193
00:08:59,918 --> 00:09:02,796
You need to cut Izzie some slack.
Her and George are having problems.

194
00:09:02,916 --> 00:09:04,667
Already? It's only been a week.

195
00:09:04,808 --> 00:09:07,026
At that point, you don't even talk.
All you do is have sex.

196
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:08,887
Doesn't mean you can't have problems.

197
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:12,388
Derek and I are having all kinds of sex,
and he's dating other people.

198
00:09:12,577 --> 00:09:14,549
- You didn't hear any of this.
- Oh, please.

199
00:09:18,979 --> 00:09:20,406
Fine. Whatever.

200
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,080
You paged me 'cause you couldn't handle
a few stitches on a wino?

201
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,665
He keeps hollering for Dr. Grey.

202
00:09:24,787 --> 00:09:27,397
I wasn't sure if I should get her
or call the cops or what...

203
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:32,378
That's not Dr. Grey.
Dr. Grey's a girl.

204
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:34,378
I want my daughter!

205
00:09:34,885 --> 00:09:36,744
Stay here.
Make sure he doesn't leave.

206
00:09:38,024 --> 00:09:40,047
<i>- Would you page her?</i>
- Karev...

207
00:09:41,217 --> 00:09:42,456
Keep Meredith out of it.

208
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,010
Get Lexie.

209
00:09:45,348 --> 00:09:47,541
- Yes, sir.
- <i>G-R-E-Y!</i>

210
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:50,725
I need to talk to you about your dad.

211
00:09:50,876 --> 00:09:52,914
You know what?
I don't want to talk about my dad.

212
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:55,522
In fact, we're never gonna
talk about him again, okay?

213
00:09:55,642 --> 00:09:57,473
You helped me out once.
Now it's over.

214
00:10:03,413 --> 00:10:05,805
I can't believe
I gotta fill out all this stuff.

215
00:10:05,998 --> 00:10:07,625
I mean,
a kid gets a bump on the head

216
00:10:07,745 --> 00:10:09,857
and you've practically
gotta write a novel?

217
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:15,104
Mandi, I know you're really busy
but if there's any chance,

218
00:10:15,235 --> 00:10:17,306
any chance you could help me
with some of this stuff.

219
00:10:17,426 --> 00:10:19,912
Patients are supposed to fill those out.
It's not the doctor's job.

220
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:22,261
You be quiet.
Uh, don't worry about it,

221
00:10:22,433 --> 00:10:24,089
Marcus.
We'll figure out something.

222
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:26,327
Good old' Mandi.
You always got my back, huh?

223
00:10:26,447 --> 00:10:28,053
You hush now.

224
00:10:28,298 --> 00:10:32,383
I hate to interrupt the reminiscing,
but I am trying to listen here.

225
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:39,177
You do have atrial fibrillation.

226
00:10:39,352 --> 00:10:41,363
But you're not symptomic,
so that's a good sign.

227
00:10:41,483 --> 00:10:44,584
We'll start you on some blood thinners
and do an outpatient workup.

228
00:10:45,698 --> 00:10:48,647
A treatment plan
you could've made yourself, Dr. Bailey,

229
00:10:48,802 --> 00:10:51,093
If you weren't acting
like such a blithering idiot.

230
00:10:55,678 --> 00:10:57,723
Teacher's pet's in trouble.

231
00:10:57,843 --> 00:11:00,613
Oh, come on.
Hush now, Marcus King.

232
00:11:03,257 --> 00:11:04,258
Hey, you paged?

233
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:06,023
- Yeah, your dad's here.
- What?

234
00:11:06,143 --> 00:11:08,733
He's drunk, he's noisy,
and you need to take him off my han.

235
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,729
I have a broken ass
I have to get back to.

236
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:11,882
Call Lexie.

237
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:13,777
I called Lexie.
She's not coming.

238
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:15,829
And the next person
I'm gonna call is the cops.

239
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:19,147
Cause the guy's ready to get outta here,
and there's no way he can drive.

240
00:11:22,696 --> 00:11:24,112
Gosh. It's good to see you.

241
00:11:24,273 --> 00:11:26,639
See! That's her.
Meredith Grey.

242
00:11:32,184 --> 00:11:33,292
|I'm sorry.

243
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:35,288
I really, really am.

244
00:11:35,408 --> 00:11:36,480
I'm sure you are.

245
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,722
The last time I was here,
I said some...

246
00:11:39,341 --> 00:11:40,834
Terrible things to you.

247
00:11:41,270 --> 00:11:44,447
Telling you not to come to Susan's
funeral? It wasn't your fault.

248
00:11:45,161 --> 00:11:47,180
I know you did everything you could.

249
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:48,524
What I said to you...

250
00:11:49,437 --> 00:11:51,296
I'll regret it till the day I die.

251
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:54,807
And the drinking...

252
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,464
is unacceptable, yeah.

253
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:00,677
But today, uh...

254
00:12:01,816 --> 00:12:02,877
Today...

255
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:06,379
Is Susan's birthday, and I...

256
00:12:10,345 --> 00:12:11,772
Should I go get Lexie?

257
00:12:12,102 --> 00:12:14,365
No, just you.

258
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:16,682
I just want you.

259
00:12:20,849 --> 00:12:22,379
I never knew what to say to them.

260
00:12:22,574 --> 00:12:24,556
In high school.
Kids like him.

261
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,029
They were always so...

262
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:28,564
separate from the rest of us,

263
00:12:28,818 --> 00:12:30,144
you know, alone.

264
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:32,840
It wasn't like that for me. I...

265
00:12:33,366 --> 00:12:36,298
I was prom queen
and class valedictorian.

266
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:38,164
Yeah, I wouldn't broadcast that.

267
00:12:38,351 --> 00:12:40,238
I had a great group of friends.

268
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,830
- You know?
- Not really.

269
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:46,816
Well, let's see what we got here.

270
00:12:48,121 --> 00:12:51,210
- Oh, you see that, Dr. Stevens?
- Yeah.

271
00:12:51,707 --> 00:12:54,629
Looks like the pencil lifted up
one of the branches of the A.C.A.

272
00:12:54,749 --> 00:12:56,411
Is that a bleed?

273
00:12:56,599 --> 00:12:57,838
It is. It's a little one.

274
00:12:58,311 --> 00:13:00,501
We need to get that pencil out
before it gets any bigger.

275
00:13:00,642 --> 00:13:01,844
I'll book an OR.

276
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,043
I am not a blithering idiot.

277
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:10,990
Hahn had no right to speak
to me that way, no right at all.

278
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:12,654
But Marcus isn't...

279
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:16,010
He's just not an old friend, is he?
He's...

280
00:13:17,141 --> 00:13:19,019
He was maybe your boyfriend or...

281
00:13:20,014 --> 00:13:22,099
You know, high school sweetheart or...

282
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:24,300
I was his tutor. Okay?

283
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,331
He was a track star,
didn't have a lot of time for homework,

284
00:13:27,451 --> 00:13:30,840
so I helped him
with his math and reading...

285
00:13:31,575 --> 00:13:32,598
And...

286
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:36,010
French and chemistry.

287
00:13:37,569 --> 00:13:38,837
Then he was just a friend?

288
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:41,641
Really?

289
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:46,091
Okay, there was some talk,
the possibility of...

290
00:13:46,269 --> 00:13:48,665
us going to the homecoming
together, but it...

291
00:13:48,785 --> 00:13:51,493
It didn't work out,
and I was fine with that.

292
00:13:52,853 --> 00:13:54,703
Certainly not a blithering idiot...

293
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:56,656
Today.

294
00:13:57,598 --> 00:13:59,936
Nor any other day in my life.

295
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,327
These and that. Thank you.

296
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:10,725
Is it me, or are there...

297
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:12,575
teenyboppers staring at you?

298
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:16,216
I get that a lot.
It started when I was there age,

299
00:14:17,296 --> 00:14:18,676
never really went away.

300
00:14:19,188 --> 00:14:20,437
Is that so?

301
00:14:22,685 --> 00:14:24,310
Go over there, come on.

302
00:14:26,715 --> 00:14:28,601
- What can I do for you, ladies?
- Tell him.

303
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:30,770
No, it's embarrassing.

304
00:14:30,941 --> 00:14:31,955
You can tell me.

305
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:35,517
You look exactly like her dad.

306
00:14:41,191 --> 00:14:42,575
Swing and a miss.

307
00:14:44,947 --> 00:14:46,910
I'm going crazy with this Hahn thing.

308
00:14:47,088 --> 00:14:49,454
Every time I try and impress her,
she hates me even more.

309
00:14:53,914 --> 00:14:55,632
Not worth getting hung up on.

310
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,543
Why, did something happen?

311
00:14:58,891 --> 00:15:01,772
Apparently they're not even talking
to each other at this point.

312
00:15:02,927 --> 00:15:05,030
I know it's wrong,
but that makes me feel better.

313
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,790
- You're not gonna sit?
- I was gonna,

314
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,089
but I really need to cram.
I got a big surgery today.

315
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,984
You know, we're operating on the kid
with the pencil, so I'll see you.

316
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:14,179
- Okay, see you around.
- Okay.

317
00:15:15,884 --> 00:15:17,658
Will she be able to sit
on her butt again?

318
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:20,599
Or will she have to carry around those
toilet seats for the rest of her life?

319
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,134
She'll have full use
of her butt in a few weeks.

320
00:15:25,088 --> 00:15:28,074
I am so, so honored to be filling in
for you as captain.

321
00:15:29,092 --> 00:15:31,104
You're filling in for me as captain?

322
00:15:31,224 --> 00:15:33,907
I prayed on it, and god seems
to think it's the right move.

323
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:37,748
- Okay.
- And I don't want you to worry.

324
00:15:37,868 --> 00:15:39,380
I called Randy I think I might've

325
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,703
convinced him to still take you
to homecoming, even though

326
00:15:41,835 --> 00:15:44,450
- your face and your butt all messed up.
- I bet he'll take you.

327
00:15:44,642 --> 00:15:45,797
He's classy that way.

328
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:47,806
Okay, so now that we've established

329
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:50,274
that Randy's a classy guy,
visiting time is over.

330
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,264
Bye, sweetie.

331
00:15:53,185 --> 00:15:55,403
- I hope they don't ruin your face.
- Go!

332
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:00,394
Kinda sucks, huh?

333
00:16:01,255 --> 00:16:03,481
Little manicured vultures.

334
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,359
My life is over.

335
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,669
My life is over.

336
00:16:09,392 --> 00:16:10,458
Mom.

337
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:12,706
I love you, too.

338
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,110
Will... Will you...

339
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:16,903
Will you tell dad....

340
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:18,537
Hello?

341
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:27,522
Thanks to your piece-of-crap phone,
my mom's gonna think I died.

342
00:16:31,854 --> 00:16:33,150
- This is where...
- Yeah.

343
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:35,024
But we'll keep you updated.

344
00:16:41,439 --> 00:16:43,262
You better not end up blind

345
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:46,771
and go to some blind kid's school,
'cause, um...

346
00:16:47,445 --> 00:16:49,738
If I have to go back to junior year
without you,

347
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:51,247
you're gonna be dead meat.

348
00:16:56,268 --> 00:16:57,306
Later, freak.

349
00:16:58,310 --> 00:16:59,540
You're the freak.

350
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:01,756
- You are.
- You are.

351
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,876
I promised his life gets better after
high school. He deserves to see that.

352
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:27,210
He's got a good friend.
That's something.

353
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,452
That girl has bee
by his bedside all day.

354
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:32,250
Yeah, but even so,
those cliques, they're miserable.

355
00:17:32,438 --> 00:17:34,513
He just needs to know
it passes eventually.

356
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:38,894
Sorry, Dr. Shepherd.

357
00:17:39,368 --> 00:17:40,401
What's so funny?

358
00:17:43,249 --> 00:17:46,750
I'm just not sure we've come as far as
you'd like to think, clique-wise.

359
00:17:47,684 --> 00:17:48,721
We?

360
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,906
The hospital.

361
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:52,282
You think the hospital's clique-y?
Oh, damn it.

362
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,984
The artery's burst.

363
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,213
His brain is swelling
and cutting off blood supply.

364
00:17:56,335 --> 00:17:58,905
Push 80 grams of Mannitol.
Okay, let's go.

365
00:18:01,148 --> 00:18:02,484
How do I tell his best friend

366
00:18:02,604 --> 00:18:04,859
that he's gonna be in a coma
for the rest of his life?

367
00:18:05,224 --> 00:18:07,985
You can't tell her yet, Derek.
The family has to know first.

368
00:18:08,191 --> 00:18:09,389
Danny's doctor.

369
00:18:10,245 --> 00:18:11,310
Thank God.

370
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:14,786
It's only been a few hours without Danny
and I'm already starting to freak out.

371
00:18:14,955 --> 00:18:16,694
I mean, look what I have to put up with.

372
00:18:16,814 --> 00:18:19,452
They're crying. like, actual real tears.

373
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:22,209
'Cause they're so worried about Danny,
which would be fine

374
00:18:22,329 --> 00:18:23,888
if they knew who Danny was.

375
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:26,220
Whatever.

376
00:18:27,604 --> 00:18:28,749
Can I see him?

377
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:32,528
He hasn't woken up yet.

378
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,144
But he's okay?

379
00:18:36,984 --> 00:18:39,159
As soon as I know something,
I'll let you know.

380
00:18:49,974 --> 00:18:51,918
She'll recover
full function of her knee?

381
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:54,699
I hope so, 'cause if she doesn't
get back on the pom-pom brigade,

382
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,529
her life is totally over.

383
00:18:56,689 --> 00:18:58,240
You'd think the way they treat her,

384
00:18:58,372 --> 00:19:00,879
she'd be ready to ditch
the whole thing, but no.

385
00:19:01,517 --> 00:19:04,682
She's not gonna walk away from that.
It's her life. It's her identity.

386
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:07,817
It's the only way
she understands herself in the world.

387
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,579
I heard one of the sweet young things
told Mark he looked like her dad today.

388
00:19:13,894 --> 00:19:15,706
What does that have to do with anything?

389
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:18,335
You just seem really
empathetic to her plight, you know?

390
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:19,795
Loss of identity,

391
00:19:20,209 --> 00:19:21,703
shattered self-image.

392
00:19:21,862 --> 00:19:23,881
You seem pretty happy
about what happened to her.

393
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,677
She's just happy 'cause Stevens
and O'Malley hit the skids.

394
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:30,670
Didn't I tell you not to tell anybody?

395
00:19:39,199 --> 00:19:41,668
I pulled all the x-rays
for tomorrow's scheduled surgeries.

396
00:19:41,809 --> 00:19:43,546
And what am i supposed to do with them?

397
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,789
I thought I could put them
in the OR if you needed me to.

398
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:48,232
Well, I don't.

399
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,584
Back off.

400
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:56,563
What?

401
00:19:56,949 --> 00:19:58,971
- You're being a brownnoser.
- I'm helping her.

402
00:19:59,091 --> 00:20:01,778
You're annoying her. You got a chance
to show her what you can do,

403
00:20:01,898 --> 00:20:04,180
you're blowing it.
And trust me, these kinds of chances

404
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:05,786
do not come around all the time.

405
00:20:06,366 --> 00:20:08,150
So, you know, just back off.

406
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:18,105
I'm sorry I didn't know you
when you were in high school.

407
00:20:18,632 --> 00:20:22,228
I've regretted it every day,
not knowing you.

408
00:20:22,733 --> 00:20:24,281
Sometimes I still worry about you.

409
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:28,119
Then other times I think, you know,
maybe that's what made you so strong.

410
00:20:28,288 --> 00:20:29,983
Not an excuse. Not at all.

411
00:20:30,473 --> 00:20:32,826
But you are so strong.

412
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:34,687
Gosh.
You're stronger than Lexie.

413
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:36,305
I don't know her that well.

414
00:20:39,352 --> 00:20:40,375
True.

415
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,852
You're a very
impressive person, Meredith.

416
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:47,669
I'm so proud of you.

417
00:20:50,715 --> 00:20:51,945
I'm a lifetime...

418
00:20:53,709 --> 00:20:55,526
A lifetime's worth of proud.

419
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:58,383
Anyway...

420
00:21:03,399 --> 00:21:04,964
How was your date with Sydney?

421
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,997
I was wondering
when you were gonna bring that up.

422
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
- My dad's in the ER.
- Really?

423
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,327
He cut himself.

424
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,470
He's not bad company, actually.

425
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:21,385
He's quite funny and charming.
Drunk.

426
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:27,139
Is it weird that I like my drunk dad
better than my regular dad?

427
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:28,316
A little.

428
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,585
Are you okay?

429
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:36,256
Yeah...

430
00:21:37,937 --> 00:21:40,716
But my patient's in a coma,
and he's never gonna wake up again.

431
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,962
His best friend is in the waiting area.

432
00:21:44,659 --> 00:21:46,002
The poor thing thinks he's...

433
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:49,354
She thinks he's gonna wake up
any second.

434
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,673
I don't know.

435
00:21:59,625 --> 00:22:00,830
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

436
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:02,207
- Who told you?
- Henry.

437
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:03,963
He was observing
in Sloan's surgery,

438
00:22:04,094 --> 00:22:06,505
and he said that Sloan
announced it to the whole OR.

439
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,948
- O'Malley and Stevens are done.
- Yeah.

440
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:13,211
- They didn't even last a week.
- I know.

441
00:22:14,009 --> 00:22:15,823
Can I have the key back to my house?

442
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,866
- What?
- The key to my house, I want it back.

443
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:21,078
I heard we broke up, I want it back.
Can I have it?

444
00:22:21,237 --> 00:22:23,211
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about?

445
00:22:23,331 --> 00:22:26,007
Really? Apparently everyone's talking
about the fact we broke up.

446
00:22:26,139 --> 00:22:28,370
- Who have you been talking to, George?
- Nobody.

447
00:22:28,493 --> 00:22:30,268
- I talked to Meredith.
- See, I knew it.

448
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,935
What do you mean, you knew it?
You been talking to her?

449
00:22:35,018 --> 00:22:36,961
But only after you were talking to her.

450
00:22:37,414 --> 00:22:39,623
So, I'm not the only one
who talked to her then.

451
00:22:39,811 --> 00:22:41,229
You talked to her first.

452
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:00,326
What is my dad doing here?

453
00:23:01,657 --> 00:23:03,198
Your dad came in drunk this morning.

454
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:06,041
That's what I was trying to tell you
earlier when you blew me off.

455
00:23:06,163 --> 00:23:08,463
So you run to Meredith?

456
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:11,547
The one person that I asked you
not to tell?

457
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:13,939
I was trying to help, okay?

458
00:23:14,445 --> 00:23:15,581
Right.

459
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:21,396
You know, you haven't changed.

460
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:23,501
I mean, not even one bit.

461
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:27,107
You get this very intense look
on your face when you're serious,

462
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:28,446
you know?

463
00:23:29,117 --> 00:23:32,985
It's your serious, home-work-doin' face.
Hasn't changed.

464
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:34,833
Dr. Bailey,

465
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:38,671
is that a patient form
I see in your hand?

466
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:41,593
Yes, I suppose it is.

467
00:23:41,713 --> 00:23:43,911
Patients are supposed
to fill out patient forms.

468
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,221
You have work to do,

469
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:47,451
- your own work.
- Yes, sir.

470
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:48,686
Mandi?

471
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:51,801
- Mandi?
- Mandi, I'm not.

472
00:23:52,889 --> 00:23:55,058
- I'm not feeling so...
- Marcus? Marcus?

473
00:23:55,246 --> 00:23:57,634
- Pulse-ox is dropping.
- Pressure is 82 over 48.

474
00:23:57,812 --> 00:24:00,616
Tell radiology we need a stat spiral CT
and page Dr. Hahn.

475
00:24:03,589 --> 00:24:04,613
Marissa.

476
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:08,275
I know Danny's parents aren't gonna
be here for a couple more hours,

477
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,723
But could I at least see him?

478
00:24:11,413 --> 00:24:12,428
Please.

479
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:16,509
All right, come on.
Let's go sit down.

480
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,564
When I removed the pencil,

481
00:24:39,662 --> 00:24:40,912
the artery burst.

482
00:24:42,995 --> 00:24:45,652
When the brain swells that much,
it has nowhere to go.

483
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:51,589
The hemor...

484
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:10,061
I am getting two cups of coffee.

485
00:25:10,262 --> 00:25:12,731
Two. One for me, one for my dad.

486
00:25:13,252 --> 00:25:14,257
He's here.

487
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:17,452
What's wrong with you?

488
00:25:17,591 --> 00:25:19,009
At this exact moment,

489
00:25:19,471 --> 00:25:22,683
in OR two, Dr. Hahn is performing
a pulmonary embolectomy.

490
00:25:24,318 --> 00:25:26,096
A pulmonary embolectomy, Meredith.

491
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,517
So what's the problem?
You're on her service. Just go.

492
00:25:28,637 --> 00:25:29,758
No, I can't...

493
00:25:29,878 --> 00:25:32,978
because that will make me a brownnoser,
and everybody hates brownnosers.

494
00:25:34,008 --> 00:25:35,775
I cannot be a brownnoser.

495
00:25:37,643 --> 00:25:38,939
Okay. So...

496
00:25:39,339 --> 00:25:42,025
there'll be other embolectomies.
You can let this one slide?

497
00:25:42,212 --> 00:25:43,292
No, I can't!

498
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,760
I don't know how to just let
a pulmonary embolectomy slide.

499
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,181
Sure you can.
It's just like cutting a class.

500
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:53,946
You never cut a class.

501
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:55,522
Never, not once.

502
00:26:02,098 --> 00:26:04,234
That was a pretty big VSD on the echo.

503
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:08,018
I'm gonna have to do an additional
arteriotomy of the right PA.

504
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:09,961
You should've taken
the situation seriously.

505
00:26:10,081 --> 00:26:11,915
You should've ordered further tests.

506
00:26:12,035 --> 00:26:14,490
Maybe I should've.
Or maybe you should've.

507
00:26:14,710 --> 00:26:18,851
And if you weren't so busy flirting with
the patient like a love-struck teenager,

508
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:20,132
maybe you would have.

509
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:22,622
Forceps, please.

510
00:26:25,541 --> 00:26:26,621
This is so sad.

511
00:26:26,929 --> 00:26:28,936
I used to walk by his house every day.

512
00:26:29,131 --> 00:26:31,357
He was in my algebra class, I think.

513
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:36,551
Marissa...

514
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:40,888
I know that this seems impossible
right now,

515
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:43,009
but you will get through this.

516
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,665
Danny would've wanted you to...

517
00:26:44,785 --> 00:26:46,680
You don't know
what he would've wanted.

518
00:26:46,893 --> 00:26:49,166
You're just like them.
You're a prom queen,

519
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:51,843
and you're trying to act like you know
what it's like for me.

520
00:26:53,368 --> 00:26:55,405
You have no idea what it's like.

521
00:26:58,494 --> 00:27:00,034
I wasn't a prom queen.

522
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:06,875
I was the girl in the cheap clothes
from the trailer park who got pregnant

523
00:27:07,482 --> 00:27:09,923
and got thrown
in the pregnant girls' class.

524
00:27:10,761 --> 00:27:13,615
None of the mothers would let
their kids hang out with me.

525
00:27:14,948 --> 00:27:16,159
But I got through it.

526
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:18,272
You will get through this.

527
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:21,161
I'm gonna write a letter
to his mom and dad.

528
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,299
That's really beautiful.

529
00:27:24,244 --> 00:27:25,760
- Get out.
- What?

530
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,696
Get out. You're not supposed
to be in here.

531
00:27:27,816 --> 00:27:29,448
- She's here.
- She's his friend,

532
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:30,886
his best friend.

533
00:27:31,908 --> 00:27:33,711
Go away. Go.

534
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:40,070
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

535
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,206
It's okay.

536
00:27:42,609 --> 00:27:44,238
You just lost your best friend.

537
00:27:45,066 --> 00:27:46,738
It's the worst thing in the world.

538
00:27:51,812 --> 00:27:54,742
I'm sorry...
about Danny metcalf.

539
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:57,162
It looked like it was hard on you,
which is good.

540
00:27:57,363 --> 00:28:00,537
If I had a son going through that,
I'd want the surgeon to be...

541
00:28:01,072 --> 00:28:02,894
fully invested like you were.

542
00:28:05,278 --> 00:28:06,974
You have no idea who I am, do you?

543
00:28:07,265 --> 00:28:08,502
Of course I do.

544
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,491
Bye, Dr. Shepherd.

545
00:28:14,017 --> 00:28:17,097
You're the nurse in OR two?
The one that talked about cliques?

546
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:18,456
Yeah. Right?

547
00:28:22,998 --> 00:28:25,109
I am never gonna be captain again.

548
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:29,021
You know, I was
fired from a job recently.

549
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:32,209
You were fired from being a doctor,
and they let you cut open my ass?

550
00:28:32,357 --> 00:28:34,731
Shut your trap for 8 seconds
and let me finish.

551
00:28:37,927 --> 00:28:40,518
I didn't get fired from being a doctor.
I got fired from...

552
00:28:40,829 --> 00:28:42,023
being, like...

553
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:45,105
our own version of squad captain,

554
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,691
which is mostly about organizing crap.

555
00:28:50,297 --> 00:28:51,546
not about surgery.

556
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,797
- So?
- So...

557
00:28:55,868 --> 00:28:57,692
I got to go back
to the part that I like...

558
00:28:58,315 --> 00:28:59,338
which...

559
00:29:00,232 --> 00:29:01,678
it's kind of a gift.

560
00:29:08,925 --> 00:29:09,929
Hahn!

561
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:11,948
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

562
00:29:35,998 --> 00:29:37,328
You paged, Dr. Hahn?

563
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:41,557
Apparently when you ask for copies
of the CT angio around here,

564
00:29:41,726 --> 00:29:45,520
people think it's all right to just give
you the slices that contain the clot.

565
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:49,422
Can you please bring me the entire CT?

566
00:29:51,133 --> 00:29:53,040
Absolutely, yes.
I'll do that right now.

567
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,448
Your dad was in the ER Today.

568
00:30:04,968 --> 00:30:07,046
- I know.
- So you know he was drunk

569
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:09,019
and he put his hand through a window.

570
00:30:09,139 --> 00:30:10,444
Yeah. Anything else?

571
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,620
I know it was Susan's birthday,

572
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,557
and I'm sure it was a very hard day
for the both of you.

573
00:30:16,697 --> 00:30:20,838
And he wasn't actually a problem.
He was kind of charming. But...

574
00:30:21,784 --> 00:30:25,014
he seemed very sad,
and I'd hate to see it happen again.

575
00:30:25,211 --> 00:30:28,404
So maybe you should think
about keeping a better eye on him.

576
00:30:34,482 --> 00:30:36,445
Every day is my mother's birthday.

577
00:30:38,965 --> 00:30:41,106
My mother was born in march.

578
00:30:42,043 --> 00:30:43,752
He lied. He's a liar.

579
00:30:44,549 --> 00:30:45,624
And I'm glad.

580
00:30:46,031 --> 00:30:47,886
Really, I'm glad
that you found him charming.

581
00:30:48,006 --> 00:30:49,414
I'm sure he was delightful.

582
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,463
He's a blast after five drinks.

583
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:54,712
Not so much after nine, though.
He gets a little weepy and mean.

584
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:56,461
He's a drunk, Meredith.

585
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:59,740
He probably came in and told you
how wonderful you are,

586
00:31:00,497 --> 00:31:03,056
how sad he is that he doesn't get
to spend more time with you.

587
00:31:04,018 --> 00:31:06,435
Yesterday he said
that I was his favorite daughter.

588
00:31:06,907 --> 00:31:09,398
The day before,
I was an ungrateful bitch.

589
00:31:09,518 --> 00:31:12,703
The week before,
he wrote me a check for $20,000

590
00:31:12,823 --> 00:31:15,595
because he said I deserved everything
life had to offer

591
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:17,356
because he was so proud of me,

592
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:19,873
a lifetime's worth of proud.

593
00:31:21,028 --> 00:31:24,886
So thank you for letting me know
that I need to keep a better eye on him.

594
00:31:25,006 --> 00:31:26,151
Thanks.

595
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:41,210
Meredith, you want to come in
for a minute and sit down?

596
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,093
Meredith?

597
00:31:56,104 --> 00:31:57,569
I'm sorry about all this.

598
00:31:57,897 --> 00:32:00,967
Meredith, please. You have nothing
to apologize for, nothing at all.

599
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,948
I'm keeping you from doing your job.

600
00:32:03,068 --> 00:32:04,204
This is my job,

601
00:32:04,655 --> 00:32:05,831
at least part of it.

602
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,149
Think of it as...

603
00:32:07,582 --> 00:32:10,189
the principal's office,
only I'm the nice principal.

604
00:32:12,802 --> 00:32:14,866
Anyway, I promised your mom
I'd take care of you.

605
00:32:15,206 --> 00:32:17,769
- I told you, you don't have to do that.
- I know.

606
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:19,167
I know I don't.

607
00:32:19,845 --> 00:32:20,850
But I do.

608
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:41,481
I guess I'm still alive and kickin'.

609
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,169
You're gonna be kickin'

610
00:32:43,693 --> 00:32:46,229
for a good long time now, Marcus King.

611
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:00,338
You have always been my angel.

612
00:33:01,283 --> 00:33:04,072
I never would've made it
through this day without you.

613
00:33:04,663 --> 00:33:06,372
- Come on.
- Mandi, I mean it.

614
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:08,098
Thank you.

615
00:33:08,716 --> 00:33:10,524
I thank you.

616
00:33:11,988 --> 00:33:13,265
My mama thanks you.

617
00:33:14,364 --> 00:33:16,105
and you know my daddy thanks you.

618
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:19,305
You tell your mama and daddy

619
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:21,154
I said they're welcome.

620
00:33:25,268 --> 00:33:27,932
I was wondering if you got a chance
to finish up that paperwork.

621
00:33:29,255 --> 00:33:30,396
I wouldn't ask,

622
00:33:31,401 --> 00:33:32,801
but, you know...

623
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,975
I think a lot of it was kind
of important.

624
00:33:36,378 --> 00:33:39,129
No, I didn't. I was planning on...

625
00:33:40,066 --> 00:33:41,541
I just gotta...

626
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:44,222
you know, finish it right now.

627
00:33:45,186 --> 00:33:46,186
Thanks.

628
00:33:47,881 --> 00:33:48,934
You're the best.

629
00:34:12,836 --> 00:34:15,204
With all due respect,
this has reached critical mass.

630
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:17,949
You saved his life,
and he's taking you for granted.

631
00:34:18,613 --> 00:34:19,944
You know what he deserves?

632
00:34:20,262 --> 00:34:21,478
A long speech.

633
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,682
You need to go right back in there.
You need to give him a long speech.

634
00:34:54,849 --> 00:34:56,192
I don't do secrets.

635
00:34:57,050 --> 00:34:59,604
I don't do any of that 15-year-old

636
00:34:59,754 --> 00:35:03,041
"I'm gonna tell you,
but don't tell anyone else."

637
00:35:03,922 --> 00:35:07,237
We're not talking about who made out
with who at the halloween dance.

638
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:09,560
This was a private family issue.

639
00:35:11,047 --> 00:35:12,317
Your dad's a drunk.

640
00:35:12,437 --> 00:35:14,587
I had to start cleaning up
my dad when I was 7.

641
00:35:14,756 --> 00:35:17,008
That's when I turned
into the grown-up of the family.

642
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:19,011
So you got to wait till you were 24...

643
00:35:19,414 --> 00:35:20,675
Good for you.

644
00:35:29,024 --> 00:35:30,110
'Night, bailey.

645
00:35:31,039 --> 00:35:32,557
- Sit down.
- What?

646
00:35:32,738 --> 00:35:33,869
Sit down!

647
00:35:35,889 --> 00:35:38,161
- You okay?
- What do you care?

648
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,513
With your...

649
00:35:39,664 --> 00:35:41,317
hair products and your...

650
00:35:42,006 --> 00:35:43,222
perfect little face...

651
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,692
perfect little life.
What do you care how I am?

652
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:48,100
My perfect little life?
Have you been paying attention?

653
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,793
I pay attention.

654
00:35:51,197 --> 00:35:54,887
I pay attention to people
in all walks of life,

655
00:35:55,056 --> 00:35:57,531
all types.
I notice people.

656
00:35:57,663 --> 00:36:00,011
I see people. It's guys like you

657
00:36:00,218 --> 00:36:02,129
who don't see people like me.

658
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:03,453
I don't see you?

659
00:36:04,002 --> 00:36:07,485
Clear... I'm not talking about you,
Shepherd.

660
00:36:07,605 --> 00:36:08,685
Just...

661
00:36:09,063 --> 00:36:10,424
guys like you...

662
00:36:11,008 --> 00:36:13,553
who don't see girls like me.

663
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:15,640
We don't exist for you.

664
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,154
We exist to do homework.

665
00:36:18,819 --> 00:36:22,040
We exist to build your ego up.

666
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:28,427
I am a successful...

667
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,493
married mother.

668
00:36:31,254 --> 00:36:33,207
I am chief resident.

669
00:36:33,564 --> 00:36:37,533
I am the chief resident
of a major metropolitan hospital.

670
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:40,697
I'm a surgeon who saved his life today.

671
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:50,485
And he still doesn't see me.

672
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:57,030
I may as well still be
that high school girl with the...

673
00:36:57,485 --> 00:36:59,202
mushroom haircut

674
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:03,393
and the coke bottle asses
and the band uniform,

675
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:06,729
the girl who didn't get to go
to the homecoming dance

676
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,244
'cause it didn't even occur to him
to ask me.

677
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:12,604
All those late nights tutoring him,

678
00:37:12,736 --> 00:37:15,046
and it didn't even occur to him to ask.

679
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:21,475
Band uniform?

680
00:37:22,146 --> 00:37:23,173
Really?

681
00:37:25,466 --> 00:37:29,128
Do I look like I want to be mocked
by you right now?

682
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,896
You don't.

683
00:37:31,113 --> 00:37:32,692
I'm just gonna say one thing.

684
00:37:33,851 --> 00:37:35,919
In high school, I was 110 pounds,

685
00:37:36,939 --> 00:37:38,873
and I hadn't yet figured out
hair product,

686
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,399
so I had a big afro, and...

687
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:43,436
I had acne.

688
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:47,177
And I, too...

689
00:37:47,984 --> 00:37:49,073
wore a band uniform.

690
00:37:52,445 --> 00:37:53,609
Sax.

691
00:37:56,854 --> 00:37:57,880
Oboe.

692
00:38:06,588 --> 00:38:08,270
And I would've been honored...

693
00:38:09,847 --> 00:38:11,725
to take a girl like you to homecoming.

694
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:15,650
<i>In some ways we grow up.</i>

695
00:38:17,687 --> 00:38:18,964
<i>We have families...</i>

696
00:38:20,155 --> 00:38:21,409
<i>We get married...</i>

697
00:38:24,939 --> 00:38:26,115
<i>Divorced.</i>

698
00:38:28,368 --> 00:38:30,669
I was trying to think of a long speech.

699
00:38:31,395 --> 00:38:33,592
You know,
like Bailey with the long speeches.

700
00:38:35,402 --> 00:38:37,235
Just everything I wanted to say to...

701
00:38:41,157 --> 00:38:43,878
It just is, I can't talk to you.
That's why I talked to Meredith.

702
00:38:44,061 --> 00:38:45,470
I just... I don't know why.

703
00:38:48,817 --> 00:38:50,226
It used to be...

704
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:54,795
It used to be...

705
00:38:56,889 --> 00:38:59,050
that I was the only person
you could talk to,

706
00:38:59,697 --> 00:39:02,148
- you were the person I could talk to.
- I know.

707
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:06,120
I'm in love with this incredible guy,

708
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:08,610
and we're having problems.

709
00:39:09,337 --> 00:39:10,792
And my best friend,

710
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:13,182
he would know
what to say to me about it.

711
00:39:13,653 --> 00:39:15,476
I need to be able to talk
to my best friend.

712
00:39:15,596 --> 00:39:17,709
I cannot get through this
without my best friend.

713
00:39:18,184 --> 00:39:19,630
Why isn't this easier?

714
00:39:22,311 --> 00:39:23,569
I don't know.

715
00:39:25,688 --> 00:39:27,391
Well, I want my best friend back.

716
00:39:29,304 --> 00:39:30,307
Me, too.

717
00:39:30,477 --> 00:39:33,002
<i>But for the most part,
we still have the same problems</i>

718
00:39:33,122 --> 00:39:34,978
<i>that we did when we were 15.</i>

719
00:39:36,565 --> 00:39:37,701
Hey, Rose.

720
00:39:40,607 --> 00:39:41,649
You know my name.

721
00:39:41,852 --> 00:39:43,523
I had to ask around, but now I know.

722
00:39:43,897 --> 00:39:45,165
Good for you.
Good night.

723
00:39:45,285 --> 00:39:48,233
Hang on. You know, I should've
recognized you from the OR today.

724
00:39:48,846 --> 00:39:50,547
We worked together for three hours,

725
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,313
and it's thoughtless.

726
00:39:55,094 --> 00:39:57,585
I've worked on 36 of your surgeries,

727
00:39:57,705 --> 00:39:59,986
and today was the first time
we made eye contact.

728
00:40:02,183 --> 00:40:04,831
Like I said,
hospital's no better than high school.

729
00:40:06,793 --> 00:40:08,323
Good night, Dr. Shepherd.

730
00:40:11,422 --> 00:40:13,762
Someone figured out
how to get back on the horse.

731
00:40:13,882 --> 00:40:15,966
What? No, no.
I was just talking about work.

732
00:40:16,716 --> 00:40:18,040
Coulda fooled me.

733
00:40:20,091 --> 00:40:21,969
Hey, dad. You want to get a drink?

734
00:40:28,415 --> 00:40:30,385
Doctors S&S.
How are we this evening?

735
00:40:31,393 --> 00:40:32,408
Hi, Sidney.*

736
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,668
Derek, do you think I just could talk
to you for one minute?

737
00:40:37,354 --> 00:40:38,659
Have a seat.

738
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:50,246
I'm a lot of woman.

739
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:52,423
Okay? I bring home the bacon.

740
00:40:53,066 --> 00:40:54,138
Fry it up in a pan,

741
00:40:54,258 --> 00:40:57,277
serve it with eggs or on a sandwich
or crumbled up in a cobb salad.

742
00:40:57,397 --> 00:40:59,688
- Well, you do a lot with bacon.
- Not just bacon.

743
00:41:00,284 --> 00:41:03,007
But, Derek, I bring a lot of things
to the table.

744
00:41:03,534 --> 00:41:06,905
And I'm looking for a man who can do
the same, a man who can meet my needs,

745
00:41:07,828 --> 00:41:08,941
all my needs.

746
00:41:09,922 --> 00:41:11,649
I just don't think you're ready.

747
00:41:13,201 --> 00:41:14,489
Well, you might be right.

748
00:41:16,278 --> 00:41:18,180
I won't let this affect our work
if you won't.

749
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:19,678
I won't.

750
00:41:27,561 --> 00:41:29,674
<i>No matter how much we grow taller...</i>

751
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:35,275
<i>grow older...</i>

752
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,418
Apparently I'm not good
at meeting needs.

753
00:41:38,947 --> 00:41:41,079
And I don't bring that much
to the table.

754
00:41:41,804 --> 00:41:43,279
I'm awkward and freaky.

755
00:41:46,594 --> 00:41:48,479
<i>We are still forever stumbling.</i>

756
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,171
Do you want to get out of here?

757
00:41:50,294 --> 00:41:51,383
I do.

758
00:41:57,926 --> 00:41:59,137
<i>Forever wondering...</i>

759
00:42:03,281 --> 00:42:04,370
<i>Forever...</i>

760
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:07,674
<i>young.</i>

00:42:08,231 --> 00:42:11,208
