00:00:07,254 --> 00:00:09,286
<i>My name is detective Brett Hopper,</i>

3
00:00:10,063 --> 00:00:12,449
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

4
00:00:12,872 --> 00:00:13,891
Put your hands up!

5
00:00:13,892 --> 00:00:16,669
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

6
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,355
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

7
00:00:19,139 --> 00:00:20,780
Who the hell are you, people?

8
00:00:21,145 --> 00:00:23,348
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

9
00:00:23,676 --> 00:00:26,738
<i>I know all this,
because I am living the same day...</i>

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,870
<i>over and over again.</i>

11
00:00:28,906 --> 00:00:31,619
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

12
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:33,308
<i>Every day, I get another chance.</i>

13
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:35,740
For every decision,
there's a consequence.

14
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:38,450
<i>I've been investigating an old murder.</i>

15
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:39,648
Where am I supposed to look?

16
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:40,858
A little closer to home.

17
00:00:40,859 --> 00:00:43,253
Your old man was
on the right track with the girl.

18
00:00:43,254 --> 00:00:44,767
<i>My father worked on a case.</i>

19
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:46,556
<i>It may be the key to this day.</i>

20
00:00:47,175 --> 00:00:49,099
Yeah, Jen, it's me. We need to talk.

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,341
It's about dad.

22
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:53,656
I'm wondering if you have
any of his old stuff...

23
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,146
I'll call you back later today.

24
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:58,366
<i>And I think my sister knows more
than she's telling.</i>

25
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,490
This is an example

26
00:01:00,513 --> 00:01:03,392
- of how we burry our secrets.
- I understand.

27
00:01:03,695 --> 00:01:06,169
<i>Now, I have to find out
what she's hiding.</i>

28
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:21,727
- Brett Hopper?
- Yeah.

29
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,264
<i>What exactly are you looking for?</i>

30
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:26,167
<i>Temporal lobe epilepsy.</i>

31
00:01:29,185 --> 00:01:30,557
<i>Hippocampus looks normal.</i>

32
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:31,948
No asymmetry or atrophy.

33
00:01:35,454 --> 00:01:37,485
I don't see any sign of neoplasms,

34
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:40,431
no apparent lesions,
no intracranial trauma.

35
00:01:42,316 --> 00:01:43,455
Then it's all good?

36
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:44,617
On first look,

37
00:01:45,562 --> 00:01:46,960
no offense, but your brain...

38
00:01:47,908 --> 00:01:49,253
Nothing special.

39
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:53,910
Do you have a family history
with this sort of thing?

40
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:56,616
I don't know.

41
00:01:56,764 --> 00:01:59,303
I'm gonna go and see my sister later,
so... I can ask her.

42
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:12,884
Hello?

43
00:02:40,286 --> 00:02:41,800
Brett, what are you doing here?

44
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:42,825
Where were you?

45
00:02:43,456 --> 00:02:46,437
At the emergency room.
James had an asthma attack.

46
00:02:48,176 --> 00:02:50,686
- I didn't know he had asthma.
- No, you wouldn't, would you?

47
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,049
- What does that mean?
- Why are you here?

48
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,878
- The police are looking for you.
- I know.

49
00:02:54,897 --> 00:02:58,033
I just had to drop by and pick up
some of dad's old stuff. Case files.

50
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:59,047
Cops stuff...

51
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:00,827
I don't have any of that.

52
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,364
Talk to mom.

53
00:03:04,215 --> 00:03:05,470
Jen, come on, be real.

54
00:03:05,471 --> 00:03:08,135
- Why don't you take the kids inside?
- Randall, it's alright.

55
00:03:08,136 --> 00:03:10,226
No, it's late. Take the kids inside.

56
00:03:10,822 --> 00:03:14,228
- I'm not finished with my sister yet.
- Tonight, you are!

57
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,742
Do you really wanna do this now? Here?

58
00:03:16,743 --> 00:03:19,795
Cops said they were running cars by here
regularly until they catch you.

59
00:03:19,796 --> 00:03:21,177
Are you threatening me?

60
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:27,553
Won't you leave us alone, Brett?
You're good at it.

61
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,203
Why is he asking
for our dad's stuff now?

62
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:46,671
Do you think he knows
about the briefcase?

63
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:48,817
I'm not sure.

64
00:04:03,101 --> 00:04:04,169
You're up early.

65
00:04:05,155 --> 00:04:08,284
Hey, baby girl, yeah.
I've got a big day ahead of me.

66
00:04:08,285 --> 00:04:11,102
- I've gotta go to see somebody.
- Anyone I would know?

67
00:04:11,137 --> 00:04:12,176
It's my mom.

68
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:14,182
Your mom?

69
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:17,402
I thought the two of you don't talk?

70
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:18,701
She talks plenty.

71
00:04:21,905 --> 00:04:24,058
I wouldn't be doing this, if...
I didn't have to.

72
00:04:24,059 --> 00:04:25,192
You know, one of these days,

73
00:04:25,193 --> 00:04:28,267
you're gonna have to tell
someone in your family about us.

74
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,984
- Unless, for some other reason...
- Believe me, I'm sparing you.

75
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,560
Brett...

76
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:35,325
Look.

77
00:04:35,337 --> 00:04:36,656
The only reason I'm going,

78
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:39,122
is to pick up
some of my dad's old stuff.

79
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:40,385
- Okay?
- Okay.

80
00:04:47,747 --> 00:04:48,787
See you later.

81
00:05:02,657 --> 00:05:04,869
Word is you killed
two ex-sheriff's deputies.

82
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:39,158
How you are doing?

83
00:05:41,262 --> 00:05:42,266
Thanks, fellows.

84
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:44,942
- What the hell?
- Relax!

85
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,773
We got him!

86
00:06:00,813 --> 00:06:02,208
Everything's gonna be fine.

87
00:06:02,209 --> 00:06:04,672
You're gonna go to school,
you're gonna teach.

88
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:07,393
You will act like it's a normal day.

89
00:06:07,585 --> 00:06:08,677
What if...

90
00:06:09,064 --> 00:06:10,550
- they come back?
- Then...

91
00:06:10,808 --> 00:06:12,065
I will take care of it.

92
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:17,724
Maybe we should call someone.

93
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:19,527
You wanna call Brett again?

94
00:06:20,217 --> 00:06:21,943
How many times
did you call him last night?

95
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:24,323
Did he pick up? Did he try to call back?

96
00:06:24,398 --> 00:06:25,423
No!

97
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:32,267
I know... You're right.

98
00:06:33,396 --> 00:06:35,096
He's never been there for us.

99
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,625
We will get through this.

100
00:06:37,682 --> 00:06:38,710
I promise.

101
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:43,346
Come in.

102
00:06:50,134 --> 00:06:51,614
So these are ex-sheriff's deputies?

103
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:54,805
I think these are the guys
that are framing me for Garza's murder.

104
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:57,382
Why would a couple of ex-cops
wanna pin a DA's death on you?

105
00:06:57,383 --> 00:06:59,331
They're just soldiers,
but if I can ID them,

106
00:06:59,332 --> 00:07:01,835
I think I can figure out
who they work for.

107
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:03,625
All I got to go on is a photo?

108
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:07,247
I was hoping you still had friends
over there at county.

109
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,825
Yeah, I can ask around.

110
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:13,031
But if it is true that some ex-cops
are involved, then...

111
00:07:13,348 --> 00:07:15,726
we both gotta be careful who we talk to.

112
00:07:15,982 --> 00:07:17,021
I know.

113
00:07:18,025 --> 00:07:19,038
Where are you headed?

114
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,041
To my mom's.

115
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:22,562
I've gotta go dig up some old ghosts.

116
00:07:22,956 --> 00:07:23,963
Thanks.

117
00:07:44,459 --> 00:07:45,915
Mamma, it's me!

118
00:07:46,502 --> 00:07:47,525
I know.

119
00:07:53,988 --> 00:07:55,842
I received a phone call this morning.

120
00:07:55,843 --> 00:07:58,027
You're wanted for murder
and you didn't tell me?

121
00:07:58,028 --> 00:07:59,376
I didn't do it, mamma!

122
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:00,573
Of course not.

123
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:02,410
I didn't raise a murderer.

124
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:03,480
But that's not the point!

125
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:07,275
Don't worry, I'll be out of here
before your husband gets home.

126
00:08:07,412 --> 00:08:09,209
His name is Henry.

127
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,318
Are you gonna to talk to me
about this Brett, or am I gonna have

128
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,433
to read it in the papers?

129
00:08:13,457 --> 00:08:16,228
Look, mamma.
I'm here so I can clear my name.

130
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:18,454
Well, running never solved anything!

131
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,933
I'm sure if you turn yourself in,

132
00:08:19,934 --> 00:08:21,746
they'd find
this was a big misunderstanding.

133
00:08:21,747 --> 00:08:23,200
Please, just listen to me.

134
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,126
I know this all set up

135
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:28,460
has to do with a case
daddy worked 15 years ago.

136
00:08:29,309 --> 00:08:30,360
I need his files.

137
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,604
You came for your father's things...

138
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,925
Your father and I divorced
long before he passed.

139
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,719
What makes you think
I kept anything of his?

140
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,834
Jen told me you did.

141
00:08:42,835 --> 00:08:43,844
Well, I didn't.

142
00:08:43,845 --> 00:08:45,523
All of his things are in storage.

143
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:46,539
Jen knows that,

144
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:48,322
she's the one that put them here.

145
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,853
Do you know where the storage place is,
mamma?

146
00:08:50,854 --> 00:08:51,864
Of course, I do.

147
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:02,194
Mamma, there was a stop sign,
back there!

148
00:09:02,217 --> 00:09:05,179
They just put that in,
I'm not stopping for that!

149
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:07,878
How was you sister when you saw her?

150
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,399
I'm wanted for murder,
and all you can ask me about is Jen?

151
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,512
I'm just hoping you didn't bring in
this trouble to her door.

152
00:09:13,513 --> 00:09:15,109
She got a family to think about.

153
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,411
She's just fine.

154
00:09:16,412 --> 00:09:18,020
She's stronger than you think.

155
00:09:18,021 --> 00:09:19,182
Believe me, I know.

156
00:09:19,558 --> 00:09:21,920
When are you gonna find someone special?

157
00:09:22,294 --> 00:09:26,276
- You could use a woman's touch.
- Yeah. Or a bullet to the head.

158
00:09:33,579 --> 00:09:35,411
So, you wanna do drinks?

159
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:40,646
Yeah, sure! I've always had
a sauce pot for you boys at county.

160
00:09:40,647 --> 00:09:42,372
Hey! While I have you on the line,

161
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,169
I was wondering,
if I email you something,

162
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:46,148
can you put some names on faces for me?

163
00:09:46,184 --> 00:09:47,236
Battle!

164
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:50,510
I gotta call you back.

165
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,362
You're late. What are you doing?

166
00:09:53,363 --> 00:09:54,369
Working...

167
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,995
Is your work
more important than your career?

168
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:02,862
Who are they?

169
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:05,983
Suspects.

170
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,403
What's the case?

171
00:10:08,636 --> 00:10:09,648
A crime...

172
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:15,126
They're a couple of guys who
might be connected to the Garza murder.

173
00:10:18,265 --> 00:10:19,532
Who asked you to look into it?

174
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,446
- Was it Hopper?
- It's personal.

175
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,703
So...

176
00:10:25,697 --> 00:10:28,102
You wanna do that meeting now, or what?

177
00:10:30,077 --> 00:10:31,102
Meeting's off.

178
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:40,798
I don't understand.

179
00:10:41,953 --> 00:10:44,318
The police wanna talk to me about Brett.

180
00:10:44,382 --> 00:10:46,773
Just go with the detective.
Answer his questions.

181
00:10:47,077 --> 00:10:48,080
Don't panic.

182
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:50,528
- What if those men call?
- They won't.

183
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:52,665
We already gave them
what they were asking for.

184
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,515
We didn't give them everything.

185
00:10:56,412 --> 00:10:59,146
- Maybe I should go to the bank.
- Everything's gonna be fine.

186
00:10:59,147 --> 00:11:00,668
OK, I'll pick up the kids,

187
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:05,380
we'll be waiting for you at home
when you get back from the station, OK?

188
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:06,930
This has nothing to do with us.

189
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:08,798
What's all the whispering about?

190
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:11,164
Is somebody telling secrets?

191
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:20,674
It's a good thing you came here.

192
00:11:21,176 --> 00:11:23,341
Of course, I never thought
it'd take 8 years

193
00:11:23,342 --> 00:11:26,417
for you to show up
and weed through all of this.

194
00:11:27,778 --> 00:11:29,608
What's all my stuff doing here?

195
00:11:32,057 --> 00:11:33,692
That was you father's doing.

196
00:11:34,579 --> 00:11:36,462
He always held on to your things.

197
00:11:36,463 --> 00:11:38,061
I thought I lost all this.

198
00:11:38,703 --> 00:11:40,744
- I never knew that he...
- They're all gone!

199
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:43,146
- What?
- Your father's notes.

200
00:11:43,364 --> 00:11:45,966
They were stacked in a dozen boxes
against this wall.

201
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:48,307
Well, does anybody else have a key
besides you and Jen?

202
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:49,321
Well, Nick.

203
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,931
- He helped us back then.
- Uncle Nick?

204
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:54,518
I suppose it makes sense
if he took them.

205
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:56,721
They were partners for years.

206
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:00,395
I hope he did take them.

207
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:02,913
And burned them.

208
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:11,702
Uncle Nick!

209
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:15,038
Are you out of your damn mind,
coming here?

210
00:12:15,423 --> 00:12:16,785
Get your ass inside.

211
00:12:17,685 --> 00:12:20,607
Haven't heard from you in months,
now there's this non-sense?

212
00:12:20,608 --> 00:12:22,649
- News travels fast.
- Are you kidding?

213
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,936
There's retired cops
all over this marina.

214
00:12:25,937 --> 00:12:28,792
I need any of my dad's files
you might have taken out of storage.

215
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:30,294
Are you calling me a thief?

216
00:12:30,554 --> 00:12:33,776
Well, I asked Jen if she had them,
she said no and neither does my mother.

217
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:34,782
That leaves you.

218
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:37,946
I never took anything out of
that place.

219
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,720
No offense, but it's something she just
don't wanna be reminded of, you know.

220
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,567
Look, I just need any notes,

221
00:12:43,765 --> 00:12:46,707
files, connected to this one case
I'm looking into.

222
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:51,488
It was a Jane Doe, I find out
her name is Isabella Contreras.

223
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,901
- You remember it?
- No.

224
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,057
Are you sure ?

225
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:59,229
You know how many of those we saw?

226
00:12:59,402 --> 00:13:01,205
And I can't remember all, kid.

227
00:13:01,327 --> 00:13:03,590
She was found on the back seat of a car.

228
00:13:04,206 --> 00:13:06,015
This hourglass was next to her.

229
00:13:06,088 --> 00:13:09,372
Prints came up, Miguel Dominguez.
Ringing any bells?

230
00:13:09,616 --> 00:13:12,379
Truth be told, if you saw my name
on a police report,

231
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:15,137
chances are I was out in that car,
asleep and worn-off.

232
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,042
Your dad covered my ass
more times than I can remember.

233
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:19,597
The evidence went missing.

234
00:13:20,224 --> 00:13:22,402
Pages from the murder book disappeared.

235
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:24,427
- It happens.
- You know something!

236
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,550
- Don't go there kid.
- Don't go where?

237
00:13:26,644 --> 00:13:29,367
- You're gonna hit an old man?
- What did you drag my father into?

238
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:30,668
He came to me!

239
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,734
What?

240
00:13:34,191 --> 00:13:35,332
Your dad and I

241
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:38,114
were told to make the case go away.

242
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,275
So we did.

243
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:41,557
We looked the other way.

244
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:44,706
You happy now?

245
00:13:58,971 --> 00:14:00,332
You know, I got your first mess.

246
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,893
You didn't have to leave any more.

247
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,405
I've got cops asking questions
about your book.

248
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,256
In connection with the Garza murder.

249
00:14:06,257 --> 00:14:07,498
What are you gonna do about it?

250
00:14:07,499 --> 00:14:10,960
You know, apparently you're forgetting
how this works. You see, you owe me.

251
00:14:12,129 --> 00:14:15,789
When you owe somebody a big favor,
you don't ask the questions.

252
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,227
I'm warning you.

253
00:14:18,128 --> 00:14:20,144
Regardless what happened between us
in the past,

254
00:14:20,163 --> 00:14:22,091
I do not respond well to threats.

255
00:14:23,572 --> 00:14:26,083
Let's just hope you have more control
over yourself

256
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:28,136
than you did
that pretty little wife of yours.

257
00:14:29,116 --> 00:14:30,862
You know, maybe I ought
to pay her a visit.

258
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,714
Just still live over there
in what was it, Fairfax?

259
00:14:54,889 --> 00:14:56,687
What? Are you crazy? I'm a cop!

260
00:15:03,955 --> 00:15:06,301
Cop or not, I still own your ass.

261
00:15:07,178 --> 00:15:08,769
Good luck getting the murder book now!

262
00:15:22,347 --> 00:15:24,872
Randall, it's me. I'm home.

263
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,736
I don't see your car.

264
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,547
Hello ?

265
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:39,789
<i>Press play.</i>

266
00:15:51,888 --> 00:15:52,927
<i>Daddy!</i>

267
00:15:53,074 --> 00:15:54,623
<i>Where are you?</i>

268
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:55,834
<i>Daddy!</i>

269
00:15:55,835 --> 00:15:58,456
<i>It's gonna be okay, guys.
Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

270
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:00,542
<i>Jen...</i>

271
00:16:01,258 --> 00:16:02,780
<i>You need to do something.</i>

272
00:16:08,704 --> 00:16:11,326
They're ex-L.A. county deputies, yeah.

273
00:16:11,717 --> 00:16:12,815
All right, thanks.

274
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:15,767
Yeah, it's Battle.
I'm sending you an e-mail.

275
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:16,855
Yeah? Battle.

276
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:18,513
I'm sending you an e-mail.

277
00:16:18,729 --> 00:16:19,916
Did you check the records?

278
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,860
All right, thanks.

279
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:30,709
Con name's Fencik?

280
00:16:32,861 --> 00:16:33,998
How about the other one?

281
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:35,546
Spell it.

282
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:38,475
Buchalter. Thank you.

283
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,277
My office!

284
00:16:45,438 --> 00:16:46,444
Now!

285
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:56,068
I wanna know why you're looking
into these guys.

286
00:16:56,069 --> 00:16:58,123
And don't gimme that crap
about it being personal.

287
00:16:58,147 --> 00:16:59,156
I told you.

288
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,294
It has to do with Garza.

289
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,928
Hopper put you up to this, didn't he?

290
00:17:01,972 --> 00:17:03,077
Hopper's a fugitive.

291
00:17:04,371 --> 00:17:07,033
If he had contacted me,
I would've informed my lieutenant.

292
00:17:08,074 --> 00:17:09,535
So... tell me something.

293
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,375
How does the other guy look?

294
00:17:11,828 --> 00:17:14,781
You're acting petty cocky
for someone with so many secrets.

295
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,994
Paying off drug dealers
to cover up for a dirty habit.

296
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,354
Well, we all have secrets.

297
00:17:20,234 --> 00:17:22,136
I'm more than willing
to face up to mine.

298
00:17:23,913 --> 00:17:24,916
Are you?

299
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,201
These guys're friends of yours?

300
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:31,540
You tread into dangerous ground,
detective.

301
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:33,220
Because if they're involved in a murder,

302
00:17:33,239 --> 00:17:35,180
you should probably talk
to robbery homicide.

303
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,132
Last I checked, you worked narcotics.

304
00:17:38,995 --> 00:17:40,446
Why don't you go back down there?

305
00:17:42,664 --> 00:17:44,137
He was a good man, your dad.

306
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,673
Always had my back.

307
00:17:47,112 --> 00:17:48,412
He had great instincts.

308
00:17:48,562 --> 00:17:49,575
He taught me a lot.

309
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,249
He helped me get sober.

310
00:17:54,705 --> 00:17:56,326
I owed him my life.

311
00:17:57,767 --> 00:17:59,109
So, understand...

312
00:17:59,313 --> 00:18:00,744
if he told me to do something,

313
00:18:01,797 --> 00:18:04,118
- I did it.
- So <i>he</i> made you a dirty cop.

314
00:18:04,178 --> 00:18:05,540
We weren't dirty.

315
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:08,411
You know what it's like out there,
it's a numbers game.

316
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:11,451
Sometimes you gotta let one go
so you can clear ten others.

317
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,827
It's survival.

318
00:18:13,131 --> 00:18:15,247
I never had to turn my head
to survive.

319
00:18:15,627 --> 00:18:16,768
You're in narcotics.

320
00:18:17,145 --> 00:18:19,655
What about all the crap
you let your informants get away with

321
00:18:19,675 --> 00:18:21,250
just so you can keep using'em?

322
00:18:25,822 --> 00:18:26,824
No, huh?

323
00:18:28,064 --> 00:18:29,999
I guess you're above all that.

324
00:18:34,748 --> 00:18:36,349
That hourglass you got...

325
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:39,122
You say Garza sent it to you?

326
00:18:39,773 --> 00:18:41,205
And he sent a picture to Jen.

327
00:18:41,317 --> 00:18:44,251
Garza was a prosecutor
your dad went to with this stuff.

328
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:47,099
My father knew Garza?

329
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,200
That Jane Doe case...

330
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:51,802
Your dad thought he had a suspect.
This Dominguez guy?

331
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:55,148
Trouble was he was locked up
in Pelican Bay at the time.

332
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:57,810
But your dad went to Garza
with the case anyway.

333
00:18:57,811 --> 00:19:00,770
So if he went to a prosecutor,
he had to have something solid.

334
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,876
All I remember is
he called in the morning, excited.

335
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:05,826
But then that night...

336
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,241
he comes to me...

337
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:08,716
scared.

338
00:19:08,942 --> 00:19:10,003
Like I'd never seen him.

339
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:12,062
He says the all thing's finished.

340
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:15,247
Whatever he found must have freaked out
some higher ops.

341
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:16,604
Higher ops how do you mean?

342
00:19:16,651 --> 00:19:19,811
You saw the murder book on this thing.
It's like Swiss cheese.

343
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,238
No autopsy reports, no evidence logs.

344
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,384
All our original notes from the scene
rewritten.

345
00:19:24,514 --> 00:19:26,246
You know what it takes to pull that off?

346
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:29,505
I don't know who gave the order
to clean the house on this,

347
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:31,698
but it was somebody way over
our pay grade.

348
00:19:31,745 --> 00:19:33,952
You think my father
gave over his notes?

349
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:36,912
Your dad was a dog with a bone.

350
00:19:37,674 --> 00:19:39,086
If he kept that stuff,

351
00:19:39,966 --> 00:19:41,328
I wouldn't be surprised.

352
00:19:41,418 --> 00:19:43,833
So then somebody had to take them
from storage.

353
00:19:43,906 --> 00:19:45,234
If you think it was me...

354
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:47,335
be my guest. Search the place.

355
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:49,840
But if you ask me...

356
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,071
cop to cop...

357
00:19:52,253 --> 00:19:53,256
your mom...

358
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:54,492
your sister...

359
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,153
One of them is holding out on you.

360
00:20:07,235 --> 00:20:08,244
Thank you.

361
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:45,590
<i>This is Jen, please leave me a message.</i>

362
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,163
Jen, it's Brett.

363
00:20:47,617 --> 00:20:48,631
Where the hell are you?

364
00:20:49,188 --> 00:20:52,389
I hope you understand
how serious this is.

365
00:20:54,343 --> 00:20:55,360
Please,

366
00:20:56,096 --> 00:20:57,813
this is everything you asked for.

367
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:00,717
Take it.

368
00:21:01,374 --> 00:21:03,521
And just give me my family back.

369
00:21:07,529 --> 00:21:09,297
That's all that's left.

370
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:11,458
I don't know what else to do.

371
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:19,675
We got a problem.

372
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,182
What happened to you?

373
00:21:27,383 --> 00:21:28,384
A cop.

374
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,577
Which one?

375
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:30,656
Shelten.

376
00:21:31,754 --> 00:21:33,246
He went for the murder book.

377
00:21:33,923 --> 00:21:37,032
He came back with all sorts
of question about Garza.

378
00:21:37,342 --> 00:21:38,602
I want to take him out.

379
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:43,225
I like what you did with Shelten.

380
00:21:44,668 --> 00:21:46,494
You owned him, you knew his secrets.

381
00:21:46,495 --> 00:21:49,307
Secrets are only good
if a man's afraid they'll get out.

382
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:51,921
We might have passed that point
with him.

383
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:58,177
I think we can kill two birds
with one stone here.

384
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,734
Just get the murder book.

385
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:04,834
I'll handle the girl in the car.

386
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:12,314
No, they should have come
to the emergency room.

387
00:22:12,387 --> 00:22:14,396
A little boy with an asthma attack.

388
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:16,830
James Mathis.

389
00:22:17,079 --> 00:22:18,097
I'm trying to find James.

390
00:22:18,407 --> 00:22:19,415
Ok, thank you.

391
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:21,316
No, no, there's nothing up to...

392
00:22:25,229 --> 00:22:26,282
Holy crap.

393
00:22:28,334 --> 00:22:29,430
<i>For every decision,</i>

394
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,030
<i>there's a consequence.</i>

395
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,993
<i>Daddy!</i>

396
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:40,637
<i>Where are you?</i>

397
00:22:40,966 --> 00:22:41,989
<i>Daddy!</i>

398
00:22:42,245 --> 00:22:44,938
<i>It's gonna be OK, guys!
Everything's gonna be fine.</i>

399
00:22:45,979 --> 00:22:46,984
<i>Jen,</i>

400
00:22:47,733 --> 00:22:49,322
<i>you need to do something.</i>

401
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:53,011
<i>You know what they want.</i>

402
00:22:53,943 --> 00:22:55,309
<i>You have to get it.</i>

403
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:08,618
Andrea, I can't talk right now.

404
00:23:10,288 --> 00:23:13,097
Listen, Hopper,
I've got some info
about those guys on the photo.

405
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:14,508
Fencik and Buchalter.

406
00:23:15,226 --> 00:23:16,806
Wait, Fencik and Buchalter?

407
00:23:16,807 --> 00:23:17,709
It's their names?

408
00:23:17,710 --> 00:23:20,189
<i>Yeah, I got their names and numbers
from a friend at county.</i>

409
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,322
But here's the crazy part:
I think Chad knows them.

410
00:23:22,578 --> 00:23:24,770
- What?
- Yeah, I showed him the photo today

411
00:23:24,771 --> 00:23:26,340
and he's been acting weird ever since.

412
00:23:26,466 --> 00:23:28,540
Hold on. Where are you?

413
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:31,631
Following Chad, he just stopped
at an ATM machine.

414
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,351
Olympic and Hope.

415
00:23:34,069 --> 00:23:35,494
Olympic and Hope?

416
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,089
<i>He was gunned down at an ATM
on Olympic and Hope.</i>

417
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,233
Andrea, you've got to get to Chad
immediately, right now!

418
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,299
Hopper, hold on.

419
00:23:44,887 --> 00:23:45,928
I think someone's coming.

420
00:23:45,947 --> 00:23:47,934
<i>Forget about that.
You need to get to Chad now!</i>

421
00:23:47,954 --> 00:23:48,776
<i>He's in danger!</i>

422
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,425
Andrea, listen to me!

423
00:23:50,566 --> 00:23:51,978
<i>You need to get to Chad now!</i>

424
00:23:52,051 --> 00:23:53,676
Hopper, wait. Your sister's here.

425
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:55,535
Jen is there?

426
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:56,891
I gotta go.

427
00:23:58,050 --> 00:23:59,148
I call you tomorrow.

428
00:23:59,214 --> 00:24:00,530
Ok, bye Mom.

429
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:03,679
What are you doing here?

430
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:05,931
Oh God, she's got a gun!

431
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:06,986
<i>What?</i>

432
00:24:09,175 --> 00:24:10,247
Drop it, Jen!

433
00:24:10,594 --> 00:24:11,597
I can't!

434
00:24:11,615 --> 00:24:12,750
What the hell is going on?

435
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:13,846
Put your gun down!

436
00:24:14,101 --> 00:24:15,161
Don't do this, Jen.

437
00:24:15,215 --> 00:24:16,437
They're gonna kill them!

438
00:24:16,438 --> 00:24:17,498
What is she talking about?

439
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:18,427
Put your gun down!

440
00:24:18,428 --> 00:24:19,274
They made me do this.

441
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:20,333
Made you do what?

442
00:24:20,553 --> 00:24:21,562
What are you doing?

443
00:24:22,205 --> 00:24:23,329
They made me do it!

444
00:24:23,603 --> 00:24:24,608
Just calm down.

445
00:24:24,609 --> 00:24:26,009
Come on, let's talk about this.

446
00:24:27,014 --> 00:24:29,132
- Put the gun down, now.
- We'll help you!

447
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,789
I'm so sorry.

448
00:24:47,635 --> 00:24:48,647
Battle!

449
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,353
Call 911!

450
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,004
This is detective Battle,

451
00:24:56,919 --> 00:24:59,710
I need an ambulance at the intersection
of Olympic and Hope.

452
00:25:13,071 --> 00:25:14,173
<i>For every decision</i>

453
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:16,053
<i>there's a consequence.</i>

454
00:25:16,543 --> 00:25:18,203
<i>I'll break into his car
and take it.</i>

455
00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:19,945
<i>Decision...</i>

456
00:25:22,463 --> 00:25:24,131
<i>consequences.</i>

457
00:25:26,344 --> 00:25:27,362
<i>Decision...</i>

458
00:25:27,363 --> 00:25:29,316
<i>Where is the package?
What did you do with it?</i>

459
00:25:29,317 --> 00:25:31,353
<i>- I don't know anything...
- I don't believe you!</i>

460
00:25:31,354 --> 00:25:32,330
<i>...consequences.</i>

461
00:25:32,331 --> 00:25:33,369
<i>I have it!</i>

462
00:25:33,561 --> 00:25:34,695
<i>... consequences...</i>

463
00:25:34,709 --> 00:25:35,992
<i>What is wrong with you?</i>

464
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:39,561
<i>Look, I'm sorry if I don't have time
for the perfect family...</i>

465
00:25:40,132 --> 00:25:43,344
<i>It's not about being perfect!
It is about being there!</i>

466
00:25:52,388 --> 00:25:53,399
She didn't.

467
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,695
<i>For every decision,</i>

468
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:04,114
<i>there's a consequence.</i>

469
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:28,772
Everybody dies.

470
00:26:32,213 --> 00:26:33,272
I can't stop it.

471
00:26:40,331 --> 00:26:41,397
You can't.

472
00:26:41,629 --> 00:26:44,554
Brett, you gotta go. You gotta go.

473
00:26:51,092 --> 00:26:52,623
There are cops everywhere.

474
00:26:52,897 --> 00:26:53,976
You gotta go now.

475
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,026
They'll catch you if you stay.

476
00:27:31,445 --> 00:27:33,030
Brett, what are you doing?

477
00:27:44,636 --> 00:27:46,359
- You're OK.
- What...is it?

478
00:27:47,452 --> 00:27:50,841
- Is it Mom?
- No, it's not Mom, it's you.

479
00:27:51,894 --> 00:27:52,905
We need to talk.

480
00:27:54,094 --> 00:27:55,550
- Now?
- Yeah, right now.

481
00:27:58,663 --> 00:28:03,022
- Brett, this isn't really a good time.
- Jen, you can't keep avoiding me.

482
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,186
I don't hear from you for weeks

483
00:28:06,377 --> 00:28:10,402
and you come to my house, and you act
like I'm the one avoiding you?

484
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:12,999
- What is that?
- I know about the photo in the shed.

485
00:28:13,094 --> 00:28:14,762
And the bruises on your arms.

486
00:28:15,104 --> 00:28:17,578
- How do you know that?
- It doesn't matter how I know.

487
00:28:19,108 --> 00:28:21,309
You have to tell me what's happening.

488
00:28:22,146 --> 00:28:24,729
- You wouldn't understand.
- It's not gonna end well

489
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:26,971
if you don't tell me what's going on.

490
00:28:27,176 --> 00:28:28,228
Now Jenny, please.

491
00:28:28,884 --> 00:28:29,923
Just let me in.

492
00:28:30,715 --> 00:28:31,726
There...

493
00:28:32,054 --> 00:28:33,489
- These men.
- OK.

494
00:28:34,623 --> 00:28:36,167
They came to me...

495
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,236
And...

496
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,094
- I took care of it.
- No.

497
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,213
Tell me what these men wanted.

498
00:28:44,423 --> 00:28:46,494
Nothing... Junk, Dad's old stuff.

499
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:48,830
No, they didn't find
what they were looking for.

500
00:28:48,831 --> 00:28:51,127
And they're gonna come back,
unless you give it to them.

501
00:28:51,185 --> 00:28:55,163
- How could you possibly know that?
- Jen, just tell me what they want.

502
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:56,488
Okay? Please...

503
00:28:58,743 --> 00:29:00,356
You wanna check on the kids?

504
00:29:05,151 --> 00:29:06,781
What the hell are you doing here, Brett?

505
00:29:06,782 --> 00:29:08,012
Are you a part of this?

506
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,476
- Do you know what's going on?
- Do you?

507
00:29:13,179 --> 00:29:15,571
Do you have any idea
what we've been through?

508
00:29:15,572 --> 00:29:17,238
Believe me, I do. Now just get this...

509
00:29:17,239 --> 00:29:20,035
Do you think you can do worst to me
than they've already done, Brett?

510
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,051
They hurt her!

511
00:29:24,353 --> 00:29:26,526
Do you think that doesn't... kill me?

512
00:29:26,868 --> 00:29:28,905
Do you think I'm just okay with that?

513
00:29:29,957 --> 00:29:33,428
Now you probably think I should just
march out there and shut them, right?

514
00:29:33,429 --> 00:29:35,266
Yeah, that's what you would've done!

515
00:29:35,267 --> 00:29:37,317
But I can't be that guy, Brett.

516
00:29:37,959 --> 00:29:39,395
Because I have a family.

517
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:42,059
You don't understand the danger
that you're in.

518
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:44,683
We took care of it, okay? It's done!

519
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:45,695
It's not done!

520
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,281
Okay, I don't care if you hate me,

521
00:29:51,282 --> 00:29:53,372
so long as you believe me
when I tell you

522
00:29:53,373 --> 00:29:55,711
that they will kill you, Jennifer

523
00:29:56,052 --> 00:29:58,587
and all of your children,
like it's nothing!

524
00:29:58,628 --> 00:29:59,707
I have seen it!

525
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,911
Now whatever it is you didn't give them,

526
00:30:02,912 --> 00:30:04,312
Jen and I have to get...

527
00:30:04,767 --> 00:30:05,773
Today.

528
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:07,904
We have to get it now, Randall!

529
00:30:08,947 --> 00:30:10,273
We have to get it now.

530
00:30:14,058 --> 00:30:15,391
I'm trusting you here.

531
00:30:15,678 --> 00:30:16,716
I know.

532
00:30:21,223 --> 00:30:23,847
I've told you.
I have no idea where Brett is.

533
00:30:23,943 --> 00:30:26,189
What about your wife?
Any idea where we can find her?

534
00:30:26,334 --> 00:30:28,576
She's... taking the kids to school.

535
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,161
If she shows up...

536
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:31,851
Have her call me.

537
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,460
Let me know when she does,
she could be in danger.

538
00:30:40,461 --> 00:30:41,473
Danger?

539
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:45,077
What are you talking about?
I mean... You mean Brett?

540
00:30:45,472 --> 00:30:46,504
He would never...

541
00:30:46,561 --> 00:30:49,901
You'd be surprised what people can do
when they're desperate.

542
00:30:50,339 --> 00:30:51,377
If I were you,

543
00:30:51,874 --> 00:30:54,357
I did your kids go home where it's safe.

544
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:59,170
I'll send a patrol of cop by later
to check on you.

545
00:31:30,671 --> 00:31:32,420
I don't understand, it's money.

546
00:31:34,388 --> 00:31:37,341
Like...What's here,
seven-eight thousand dollars?

547
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:38,940
There used to be more.

548
00:31:41,689 --> 00:31:42,742
How much more?

549
00:31:43,029 --> 00:31:44,081
Maybe...

550
00:31:44,464 --> 00:31:45,475
A hundred...

551
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:46,909
Thousand.

552
00:31:48,101 --> 00:31:49,207
So you took it?

553
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:50,519
We needed it.

554
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,280
We're having another baby!

555
00:31:53,649 --> 00:31:55,774
Randall was out of work,
we had a mortgage to pay.

556
00:31:55,775 --> 00:31:58,112
You put your family in jeopardy
for a couple of days off

557
00:31:58,113 --> 00:31:59,417
and some new curtains?

558
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,088
That was Dad's dirty money.

559
00:32:03,585 --> 00:32:07,452
- What do you want? Your shares?
- It's not about the money, Jen!

560
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:08,792
You weren't there.

561
00:32:10,312 --> 00:32:11,952
Dad shot himself!

562
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:15,970
Who do you think dealt with the body?

563
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:19,031
Who do you think made
funeral arrangements?

564
00:32:19,032 --> 00:32:21,711
Did you think the coroner
cleaned up the blood?

565
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,729
What's sure is that it wasn't you.

566
00:32:30,606 --> 00:32:34,043
You wanna know where I was
when I got the call about Dad?

567
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:35,779
Under cover.

568
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,173
Surrounded by a bunch of low life scum
who were gonna blow up my brains

569
00:32:40,174 --> 00:32:41,197
if they knew I was a cop!

570
00:32:41,198 --> 00:32:43,863
I don't care where you were
when you found out!

571
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,092
- But where you were after?
- I was doing my job.

572
00:32:47,093 --> 00:32:49,948
- That's what Dad would have wanted!
- Dad was dead!

573
00:32:50,003 --> 00:32:52,243
Well, we weren't
and you just disappeared!

574
00:32:52,244 --> 00:32:53,795
You never called for help!

575
00:32:53,796 --> 00:32:55,668
Why didn't you call me for help?

576
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:57,773
Our father kills himself.

577
00:32:58,428 --> 00:32:59,877
And I have to ask?

578
00:33:00,547 --> 00:33:01,927
You were his son!

579
00:33:03,574 --> 00:33:05,666
You're not gonna drag me into this, Jen.

580
00:33:05,707 --> 00:33:07,716
You're not gonna drag me into this.

581
00:33:07,873 --> 00:33:09,185
This doesn't make sense.

582
00:33:10,511 --> 00:33:12,547
Why would this people
shake down a school teacher

583
00:33:12,548 --> 00:33:15,261
- for a hundred thousand dollars?
- OK, stop it!

584
00:33:15,602 --> 00:33:19,736
Could you for once stop being a cop
and just be my brother?

585
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:23,620
Could you do that?

586
00:33:26,258 --> 00:33:27,270
Could you?

587
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:47,349
I never stopped being your brother.

588
00:33:53,049 --> 00:33:54,279
I don't understand...

589
00:33:56,361 --> 00:33:57,509
...why he did it.

590
00:33:58,753 --> 00:34:01,965
- Why he left this on me.
- He didn't leave this on you.

591
00:34:03,113 --> 00:34:04,123
I did.

592
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:06,557
But I'm here now.

593
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,219
And I'm not going anywhere.

594
00:34:11,859 --> 00:34:13,089
I spent the money.

595
00:34:14,756 --> 00:34:17,339
- I don't...
- So we'll give them what we have.

596
00:34:18,543 --> 00:34:19,938
If they don't like it...

597
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,066
they're gonna have to deal with me.

598
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:26,828
Hopper's sister wasn't at school
so I spoke to the husband.

599
00:34:26,829 --> 00:34:28,960
The guy was nervous.
Tell you, he's hiding something.

600
00:34:28,961 --> 00:34:30,765
Some people just don't like cops.

601
00:34:30,866 --> 00:34:32,815
I wouldn't be surprised
his sister's in on it.

602
00:34:32,816 --> 00:34:34,481
The apple doesn't fall far of that tree.

603
00:34:34,625 --> 00:34:36,591
- What are you talking about?
-The old man,

604
00:34:36,592 --> 00:34:39,026
I worked for him for five years,
the guy was dirty.

605
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,092
I never of heard that.

606
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:43,194
You were in high school.
Everyone knew he was on the take.

607
00:34:43,285 --> 00:34:44,857
Well, so you saw this or you heard?

608
00:34:44,870 --> 00:34:48,581
The guy is at department, at D3
with 25 years in, set for life,

609
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:49,879
then he eats a bullet?

610
00:34:49,975 --> 00:34:52,039
Sounds like someone
with a clean conscience to you?

611
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,699
- That sounds like a shame.
- A shame?

612
00:34:54,807 --> 00:34:57,147
The guy takes the easy way out
and everyone here clears

613
00:34:57,148 --> 00:34:58,732
so the family'll get the pension.

614
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:00,208
So what? The guy was a cop.

615
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:03,308
- And you look out for blood?
- What is your problem?

616
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,088
The guy was dirty,
he doesn't deserve anything.

617
00:35:06,754 --> 00:35:09,005
What have you got against Hopper's dad?

618
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:14,048
Look, the only Hopper that I care about
put three bullets in Alberto Garza.

619
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:22,254
What is this? Are these those...

620
00:35:22,255 --> 00:35:23,404
Keep the case in the car.

621
00:35:23,405 --> 00:35:25,704
- What is going on?
- Stay in the car.

622
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,046
My children!

623
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:47,040
- Where are they?
- They're inside, they're fine.

624
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,082
They're fine.

625
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:53,089
Jen, these men...
they want the briefcase.

626
00:35:54,723 --> 00:35:56,541
Give them the briefcase, Jen.

627
00:35:57,133 --> 00:35:58,144
Please...

628
00:36:10,199 --> 00:36:12,878
- You have to give it to them.
- I got what you want.

629
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:14,737
I'll give it to you. Nobody gets hurt.

630
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,117
Jen, go get the case.

631
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:28,947
Everything's gonna be okay.

632
00:36:29,065 --> 00:36:30,186
I'm gonna fix this.

633
00:36:32,236 --> 00:36:33,247
Take it!

634
00:37:10,612 --> 00:37:11,664
Are we good?

635
00:37:13,666 --> 00:37:14,678
We're good.

636
00:37:31,497 --> 00:37:32,535
Oh my God!

637
00:37:33,191 --> 00:37:34,490
Oh my God, you guys...

638
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,447
Come here, come here...

639
00:38:10,151 --> 00:38:11,189
I'm sorry, Jen.

640
00:38:14,052 --> 00:38:15,064
I'm so sorry.

641
00:38:37,136 --> 00:38:40,936
James has just said that he wants
to go to school barefoot.

642
00:38:44,118 --> 00:38:45,130
You okay?

643
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:48,205
I don't know.

644
00:38:48,642 --> 00:38:50,651
Honey, everything's gonna be fine.

645
00:38:50,652 --> 00:38:53,508
- We can get through this.
- No... It's not that.

646
00:38:57,725 --> 00:38:58,777
I feel...

647
00:38:58,804 --> 00:38:59,829
different.

648
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:01,633
Different? What do you mean?

649
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,939
I don't know, I just feel it.

650
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:08,680
Things are gonna be different today.

651
00:39:09,666 --> 00:39:11,334
Aren't they different every day?

652
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:14,176
I can understand you're scared.

653
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,565
But we can handle this.

654
00:39:18,235 --> 00:39:19,479
I'm gonna call Brett.

655
00:39:19,629 --> 00:39:21,720
Are we talking about the same Brett?

656
00:39:22,548 --> 00:39:26,443
Jen, you're the one who's always saying
we can't count on him for anything!

657
00:39:26,444 --> 00:39:28,111
That was our father's money.

658
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:30,052
I have to tell him.

659
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:32,472
He's my brother.

660
00:39:35,231 --> 00:39:36,434
I'm so terrified.

661
00:39:37,266 --> 00:39:39,291
What if these men wanted the money...

662
00:39:39,651 --> 00:39:40,655
and I spent it?

663
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:46,151
When I woke up this morning though,
I had a thought.

664
00:39:46,356 --> 00:39:48,557
These men, they don't seem
like they need money.

665
00:39:48,558 --> 00:39:49,833
I was thinking the same thing.

666
00:39:49,834 --> 00:39:52,271
So if they don't want the money,
then what?

667
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:08,898
- Well, the lining's different.
- So?

668
00:40:18,022 --> 00:40:19,061
What is that?

669
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:24,050
It's an autopsy report.

670
00:40:31,606 --> 00:40:33,888
Who is Isabella Contreras?

671
00:40:33,984 --> 00:40:37,045
She's a girl that was killed.
And he wanted to find out about it.

672
00:40:39,683 --> 00:40:40,688
Oh God.

673
00:40:40,742 --> 00:40:41,945
What does that mean?

674
00:40:42,082 --> 00:40:45,512
- When she died, she was pregnant.
- Those men wanted this?

675
00:40:46,063 --> 00:40:47,512
What am I supposed to do?

676
00:40:49,275 --> 00:40:51,517
- You're gonna give it to them.
- They came to me.

677
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:54,790
- How am I supposed to reach them?
- You're gonna call this number.

678
00:40:54,831 --> 00:40:57,469
You're gonna ask
for Fencik or Buchalter.

679
00:40:57,558 --> 00:40:58,829
You're gonna say who you are

680
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:02,069
and you're gonna tell them
that you have what they want.

681
00:41:04,426 --> 00:41:06,722
How could you possibly know
those people?

682
00:41:07,023 --> 00:41:09,223
Andrea managed to track them down
for me yesterday.

683
00:41:09,224 --> 00:41:12,182
So this is all... they wanted from me?

684
00:41:15,132 --> 00:41:16,813
Isn't this Dad's handwriting?

685
00:41:20,175 --> 00:41:22,280
- Yeah, it is.
- What does it mean?

686
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:25,765
I don't know.
I only recognize these two names.

687
00:41:27,774 --> 00:41:29,879
So who's Tobias Booth?

688
00:41:31,409 --> 00:41:32,693
...and as your councilman,

689
00:41:32,803 --> 00:41:35,649
I promise to continue
Alberto Garza's effort.

690
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:39,743
He would have wanted us to remember
that hope is bigger than anyone of us.

691
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:43,465
And like his memory, it will carry on.

692
00:41:44,094 --> 00:41:45,761
As Alberto used to say,

693
00:41:46,677 --> 00:41:47,921
you cannot kill hope...

694
00:41:48,536 --> 00:41:49,561
with a bullet.

695
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:51,795
I'd like to...

696
00:41:51,986 --> 00:41:53,080
Put it all down.

697
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,542
The captain wants the book...

698
00:41:56,457 --> 00:41:57,510
the gang leader...

699
00:41:58,439 --> 00:41:59,451
Hopper.
