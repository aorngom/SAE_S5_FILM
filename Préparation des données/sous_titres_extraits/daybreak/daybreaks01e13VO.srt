1
00:00:11,588 --> 00:00:13,593
<i>My name is Detective Brett Hopper.</i>

2
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,564
<i>And this is the day that
changes everything.</i>

3
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:20,863
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

4
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,322
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

5
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,706
Who the hell are you, people?

6
00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:27,248
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

7
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,803
<i>I know all this
because I am living the same day...</i>

8
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:33,058
<i>over, and over again.</i>

9
00:00:33,142 --> 00:00:35,863
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

10
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:37,721
<i>The pieces are finally coming together.</i>

11
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:39,518
They wanted me to set up a meeting.

12
00:00:39,601 --> 00:00:41,654
- What's it about?
- Corruption at city hall.

13
00:00:41,821 --> 00:00:43,062
<i>Why Garza was murdered.</i>

14
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,870
He cut a deal.
He was supposed to testify againt Booth.

15
00:00:45,906 --> 00:00:46,992
<i>Why I was framed.</i>

16
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:48,507
Garza sent me two packages.

17
00:00:48,543 --> 00:00:50,381
<i>Evidence
from one of my father's old cases.</i>

18
00:00:50,548 --> 00:00:52,640
<i>Everyone around me
is somehow tied to this.</i>

19
00:00:52,694 --> 00:00:54,458
Shelten... It's been a while.

20
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,797
You're asking me to lie.

21
00:00:55,878 --> 00:00:57,614
You've had four years of practice.

22
00:00:57,628 --> 00:00:59,104
What the hell are you doing here, D.?

23
00:00:59,105 --> 00:01:00,594
I need five minutes.

24
00:01:00,642 --> 00:01:01,708
<i>But until yesterday,</i>

25
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:03,570
<i>I was missing a couple of key players.</i>

26
00:01:03,593 --> 00:01:06,293
They arraigned some lawyer.
His name is Barry Coldburn.

27
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:08,726
Booth, Detweiler. Spivak?

28
00:01:08,783 --> 00:01:10,163
<i>Now, it's time to finish it.</i>

29
00:01:10,164 --> 00:01:11,161
Great minds, uh?

30
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:51,597
I love you.

31
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,429
I love you too.

32
00:02:01,256 --> 00:02:02,800
There's something I need to tell you.

33
00:02:04,673 --> 00:02:06,341
It's about my brother Billy.

34
00:02:13,155 --> 00:02:16,366
Billy was sure we'd go to jail
for what we did to Dad.

35
00:02:18,103 --> 00:02:19,155
Freaked out.

36
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:22,485
I did the only thing
that I could think of.

37
00:02:23,497 --> 00:02:24,503
I called Chad.

38
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:35,449
I can't let this hang over me anymore.

39
00:02:37,182 --> 00:02:39,615
I think I should go to the police
and tell them what I did.

40
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:40,863
No, not today.

41
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:44,463
It's too dangerous. Call your brother,
tell him to get out of town.

42
00:02:44,558 --> 00:02:45,611
These people are serious.

43
00:02:51,367 --> 00:02:53,916
What are you saying?
These are the same people that are...

44
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:55,586
framing you for Garza's murder?

45
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:59,050
I think it all revolves
around a case this judge is building.

46
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,139
The grand jury's supposed
to convene tomorrow.

47
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:04,005
And Garza was supposed to testify.
I think that's why...

48
00:03:04,087 --> 00:03:05,112
he was killed.

49
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:07,124
But what does that have to do with us?

50
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:08,935
I don't know. But...

51
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:11,771
If we're gonna get through this,
we're gonna need some help.

52
00:03:14,184 --> 00:03:16,140
- Thanks for coming.
- Not a problem.

53
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,839
Pleasant surprise.

54
00:03:18,671 --> 00:03:19,682
Everything alright?

55
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:24,794
Cream, two sugars, right?

56
00:03:28,938 --> 00:03:31,603
Real nice of you using Rita
to embush me.

57
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:33,134
She told me everything.

58
00:03:33,763 --> 00:03:35,307
About Billy. Her father.

59
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:38,512
How you helped them out with the body.

60
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,115
I'm sorry, Chad. I...

61
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:42,848
I just... I couldn't lie to him anymore.

62
00:03:43,422 --> 00:03:45,003
I would have done the same thing.

63
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:46,150
Please...

64
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,122
Just hear him out.

65
00:03:52,948 --> 00:03:56,433
- What do you want from me, Hopper?
- Those guys you dealt with back then.

66
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:58,059
The same guys are messing with me now.

67
00:03:58,251 --> 00:04:00,294
Something really big is about to happen.

68
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,139
And it deals with politicians...

69
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:03,232
gangs...

70
00:04:03,574 --> 00:04:04,613
crooked cops...

71
00:04:05,815 --> 00:04:07,783
Today's the day
I'm gonna bring it all down.

72
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,449
I'm asking,

73
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:12,138
are you in?

74
00:04:15,295 --> 00:04:16,347
I'm listening.

75
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,366
There's a case going
before the grand jury tomorrow,

76
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:22,319
investigating corruption in city hall.

77
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:26,448
But there's a Robbery/Homicide Detective
named Spivak. You know him?

78
00:04:28,305 --> 00:04:29,918
A real pain in the ass. What about him?

79
00:04:30,013 --> 00:04:31,930
Subpoenas are being issued in this case.

80
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,461
His name is on the list.

81
00:04:34,171 --> 00:04:35,456
Wanna be part of this?

82
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:37,028
Look into Spivak.

83
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:40,976
What makes you think I'll help <i>you</i>
of all people?

84
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:44,557
The sniper was gonna shoot you,
but I pushed you out of the way.

85
00:04:44,885 --> 00:04:47,919
<i>- Why did you do it?
- We were friends once. Partners.</i>

86
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,519
I know we got our issues, but...

87
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:54,622
at the end of the day,
I think you're a good cop.

88
00:04:55,876 --> 00:04:56,915
A good man.

89
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:01,373
I think we should tell him about Garza.

90
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:04,504
The A.D.A. that got killed last night?

91
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,340
Brett's being framed for his murder.

92
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,511
OK, I'm on my way.

93
00:05:13,455 --> 00:05:15,376
I'd love to explain, but I gotta go.

94
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:18,236
You can't just say you're wanted
for killing a public official

95
00:05:18,237 --> 00:05:19,275
and expect to walk away.

96
00:05:19,276 --> 00:05:20,905
I forgot to make this phone call.

97
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,837
- No, I can't let you go.
- Get out of my way.

98
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:25,311
You talked a good game
about corruption and dirty cops,

99
00:05:25,312 --> 00:05:27,712
but you failed to mention
that you're wanted for murder.

100
00:05:27,713 --> 00:05:30,140
- You don't understand.
- I have to do this.

101
00:05:30,141 --> 00:05:31,729
Let's go down to the station.

102
00:05:34,045 --> 00:05:36,384
Easy. If you're innocent,
you got nothing to worry about.

103
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:37,424
Margo, wait.

104
00:05:39,015 --> 00:05:40,053
Don't move.

105
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,815
Give it up, pal.

106
00:05:54,242 --> 00:05:56,183
- No place left to run.
- Right.

107
00:05:58,652 --> 00:06:00,405
- Freeze!
- Margo, don't get in the car.

108
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:01,726
OK, give me twenty minutes.

109
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,315
Stop the bus!

110
00:06:11,918 --> 00:06:13,075
I'm a police officer.

111
00:06:13,113 --> 00:06:14,673
Yeah! But what the hell, are you crazy?

112
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,532
Get out of the bus,
you'll have a stroke.

113
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:18,670
Pal, I don't know
what the hell you are thinking.

114
00:06:18,671 --> 00:06:21,336
This bus is about to crash,
he's gonna have a stroke any second.

115
00:06:21,345 --> 00:06:22,865
- What did you say?
- This is insane!

116
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:25,485
- I gotta hit you outta here.
- Please, just calm down.

117
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:28,946
Rita, call 911, now!

118
00:06:29,135 --> 00:06:30,752
- Easy.
- We got him.

119
00:06:30,753 --> 00:06:32,446
I think he's having a stroke!

120
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,474
Hold on, sir.

121
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:34,770
You gotta stand up.

122
00:06:37,832 --> 00:06:38,836
What are you doing?

123
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:41,126
Do some digging,
you'll find Spivak's the inside man.

124
00:06:43,308 --> 00:06:45,680
Promise me you'll go to the hospital
and stay there.

125
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:46,957
I need to know you're safe.

126
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,128
- I can't.
- Promise me.

127
00:06:48,234 --> 00:06:49,688
Don't leave until I say.

128
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:51,298
- All right?
- I promise.

129
00:06:52,857 --> 00:06:53,876
Alright.

130
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:16,284
May I help you?

131
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,636
Yes, Detective Brett Hopper. LAPD.

132
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:20,385
I'm looking for Margo Clarke.

133
00:07:20,906 --> 00:07:21,931
She stepped away.

134
00:07:23,247 --> 00:07:24,573
Are you Judge Nitzberg?

135
00:07:25,302 --> 00:07:26,327
Yes, why?

136
00:07:27,215 --> 00:07:29,962
I'm here
about the grand jury hearing tomorrow.

137
00:07:31,322 --> 00:07:34,742
Damien Ortiz,
he's my confidential informant.

138
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:37,592
And I know
that he was testifying for you.

139
00:07:37,811 --> 00:07:38,836
So was Garza.

140
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,079
Who sent you, Booth?

141
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:45,451
No, sir. We're on the same side.

142
00:07:47,946 --> 00:07:49,928
Booth framed me for Garza's murder.

143
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:54,594
You can tell Booth and his cronies
I will not be intimidated.

144
00:07:54,867 --> 00:07:58,858
This grand jury investigation
will proceed with or without Garza.

145
00:07:58,859 --> 00:07:59,869
That's good.

146
00:08:00,364 --> 00:08:02,165
See, that's why I'm here. Sir,

147
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:05,075
Garza sent me two packages.

148
00:08:05,543 --> 00:08:08,632
Evidence linked to a homicide
that my father worked.

149
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:10,753
Evidence that leads right back to Booth.

150
00:08:10,933 --> 00:08:13,212
- Garza sent you evidence?
- Yes, sir.

151
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:15,757
In case something would happen to him,
I guess I was his...

152
00:08:15,811 --> 00:08:17,000
insurance policy.

153
00:08:17,818 --> 00:08:19,062
And somebody found out.

154
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,805
Now, did anybody else know
that he was gonna testify...

155
00:08:21,806 --> 00:08:22,838
Detective.

156
00:08:22,873 --> 00:08:24,977
I can't risk discussing the details.

157
00:08:24,983 --> 00:08:27,484
Your Honor, I just need to know
if I'm on the right track.

158
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:31,142
Who else knew?

159
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:38,378
Technically...

160
00:08:38,704 --> 00:08:39,729
No one.

161
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:41,673
The warrant was sealed, but...

162
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,588
But what?

163
00:08:43,802 --> 00:08:46,480
Last night, he called
and said he was having second thoughts.

164
00:08:46,649 --> 00:08:49,054
- Garza called you last night?
- He was scared,

165
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:52,545
he said that his wife kept telling him
how dangerous these people are.

166
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,320
So Mrs. Garza was trying
to talk him out of testifying.

167
00:08:55,463 --> 00:08:58,294
- She's in on this. With Booth.
- What?

168
00:08:58,334 --> 00:09:01,040
She claimed
that she saw me murder her husband.

169
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,091
She's the key witness against me.

170
00:09:03,170 --> 00:09:04,195
Julissa?

171
00:09:04,715 --> 00:09:06,027
- Why?
- I don't know but if...

172
00:09:06,064 --> 00:09:08,241
if Garza told her about the packages,

173
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,530
and she told Booth...

174
00:09:10,243 --> 00:09:11,514
She's the connection.

175
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:14,291
She betrayed her husband.

176
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:15,918
That's how Booth found out about me.

177
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,653
That's why I'm being framed.

178
00:09:19,188 --> 00:09:20,418
Now, this grand jury...

179
00:09:20,419 --> 00:09:23,059
Do you have enough
to bring down Booth without Garza?

180
00:09:23,387 --> 00:09:26,204
I don't know.
We've had to postpone the hearing.

181
00:09:26,531 --> 00:09:28,724
But the other presiding judges and I
are going to

182
00:09:28,786 --> 00:09:30,228
need to see if we can continue.

183
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:32,305
- When's the meeting?
- It hasn't been set yet.

184
00:09:32,727 --> 00:09:34,628
Let's say I can break Mrs. Garza.

185
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:37,566
Is she just as valuable to you
as her husband?

186
00:09:37,884 --> 00:09:40,044
- You think you can do that?
- Yes.

187
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:41,767
But I need a favor from you.

188
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:53,874
I surrender.

189
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,987
- Jenny.
- Brett.

190
00:10:06,777 --> 00:10:07,994
Everything's gonna be OK.

191
00:10:08,448 --> 00:10:10,357
- Can you give us a sec?
- Yeah.

192
00:10:10,903 --> 00:10:11,917
Make it fast.

193
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:15,643
Everything is in here,
just like you wanted.

194
00:10:15,942 --> 00:10:16,944
All this...

195
00:10:17,278 --> 00:10:18,830
- Is it about Dad? Why--
- Yes.

196
00:10:20,563 --> 00:10:24,036
I know it's been eating you up inside
for a long time.

197
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,427
Why he killed himself.

198
00:10:28,136 --> 00:10:29,899
But you need to realize

199
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:31,402
you're not Dad.

200
00:10:33,493 --> 00:10:34,764
Hopper, we gotta move.

201
00:10:37,487 --> 00:10:38,525
Thanks, sister.

202
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,997
Look, I'm only doing this
because Judge Nitzberg called

203
00:10:42,998 --> 00:10:45,223
- and vouched for you.
- You're doing the right thing.

204
00:10:46,309 --> 00:10:47,334
I'd better be.

205
00:10:48,142 --> 00:10:51,108
You screw this up and I'm running
a desk for the next ten years.

206
00:10:51,163 --> 00:10:53,855
- Where is she?
- Inside, with your partner.

207
00:10:54,053 --> 00:10:56,076
- You've got ten minutes.
- Alright.

208
00:10:56,992 --> 00:10:58,277
- I'll wait for you.
- Alright.

209
00:11:03,547 --> 00:11:04,941
Oh God. It's him.

210
00:11:05,419 --> 00:11:07,037
That's the man that killed my husband!

211
00:11:07,038 --> 00:11:08,599
Be quiet. Save your breath.

212
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:10,931
I know you're in on it.

213
00:11:11,409 --> 00:11:13,132
Framing me for your husband's murder.

214
00:11:13,364 --> 00:11:14,430
Why is he here?

215
00:11:14,676 --> 00:11:15,920
This man is a killer.

216
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:17,737
He's innocent till proven guilty.

217
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:19,077
Why did you do it?

218
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,493
Did Booth have something on you?

219
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,778
This is ridiculous.

220
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:26,127
They found a gun in his apartment.

221
00:11:26,181 --> 00:11:27,234
She's got a point.

222
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:28,758
Give me a favor, go down to SID,

223
00:11:28,759 --> 00:11:31,327
grab hold of ballistics and prints
for the murder weapon.

224
00:11:31,656 --> 00:11:32,981
Someone's gonna fake the results.

225
00:11:33,938 --> 00:11:35,660
- You sure about all this?
- I'm sure.

226
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:45,328
<i>Now we're gonna start
at the very beginning.</i>

227
00:11:49,577 --> 00:11:51,600
Don't... touch the bubble head.

228
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:16,146
The detective who just left...
Spivak. What was he doing down here?

229
00:12:23,964 --> 00:12:25,290
It's a simple question.

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,969
Was the gun in my right hand
or in my left?

231
00:12:28,174 --> 00:12:29,924
- I'm not...
- Right or left?

232
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,702
You said I was standing
over your husband's body with the gun.

233
00:12:32,703 --> 00:12:34,811
- Which hand was it in?
- I demand to see a lawyer.

234
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:36,396
Did I leave out the back or the front?

235
00:12:36,397 --> 00:12:38,829
- I don't know.
- You don't know because I wasn't there!

236
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,150
Did you even know
what your husband had on Booth?

237
00:12:44,818 --> 00:12:45,843
I do.

238
00:12:46,116 --> 00:12:47,169
He sent it to me.

239
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,770
I don't know what you're talking about.

240
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,337
That's Isabella Contreras.

241
00:12:54,184 --> 00:12:55,387
Booth had her killed.

242
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:57,245
Killed.

243
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,733
One to the head, two to the chest.

244
00:13:01,665 --> 00:13:02,704
Sound familiar?

245
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:04,221
<i>That's his M.O.</i>

246
00:13:04,754 --> 00:13:06,079
What the hell is this?

247
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:15,519
Booth didn't tell you about Isabella,
did he?

248
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,195
I've known Tobias for 25 years.

249
00:13:19,824 --> 00:13:21,642
<i>He's an honorable man.</i>

250
00:13:21,732 --> 00:13:22,784
<i>How dare you?</i>

251
00:13:23,912 --> 00:13:26,530
You let a murder suspect into a room
with our only eye witness?

252
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:28,984
I got a call from a presiding judge
who vouched for Hopper.

253
00:13:28,985 --> 00:13:30,458
- What judge?
- Nitzberg.

254
00:13:31,825 --> 00:13:34,893
See, the sad thing about this
is that when a woman's pregnant,

255
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:37,514
they do a separate autopsy...

256
00:13:38,047 --> 00:13:39,058
on the fetus.

257
00:13:41,174 --> 00:13:43,339
See, that's the man
that you're trying to protect.

258
00:13:43,374 --> 00:13:45,293
- It's not possible.
- He got a girl pregnant,

259
00:13:45,294 --> 00:13:47,461
and then killed her
to save his own career.

260
00:13:47,643 --> 00:13:48,941
Tobias would never...

261
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:53,670
Tobias...

262
00:14:01,711 --> 00:14:02,859
I had it all wrong.

263
00:14:03,146 --> 00:14:05,066
Here I thought
he was blackmailing you...

264
00:14:07,061 --> 00:14:08,168
That's not what happened.

265
00:14:12,191 --> 00:14:13,516
You were sleeping with him.

266
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:19,858
You realize what you've done?

267
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:21,771
Mrs. Garza's testimony is tainted,

268
00:14:21,772 --> 00:14:24,240
we'll be lucky if anything she says
is admissible in court.

269
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,347
Your husband would tell you everything.

270
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:31,592
But he didn't know
that you were rolling over

271
00:14:31,593 --> 00:14:33,657
and whispering those same secrets

272
00:14:34,244 --> 00:14:35,447
into Booth's ear.

273
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:37,928
- You have no right.
- You basically let the killer in,

274
00:14:37,929 --> 00:14:40,443
let the killer put a bullet
in your husband's head.

275
00:14:40,593 --> 00:14:43,272
- I don't have to hear this from you.
- Garza flipped on Booth,

276
00:14:43,654 --> 00:14:45,664
finally listened to his conscience,

277
00:14:45,766 --> 00:14:47,871
finally found the strength to say no.

278
00:14:48,119 --> 00:14:49,521
Alberto was weak!

279
00:14:49,703 --> 00:14:51,110
He got what he deserved!

280
00:14:54,178 --> 00:14:55,326
<i>You have no idea...</i>

281
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,321
<i>what I sacrificed...</i>

282
00:14:57,376 --> 00:14:59,604
Did she just say what I think she did?

283
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:02,440
I put in too much time,

284
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:05,777
too many years to let it all die.

285
00:15:06,597 --> 00:15:09,332
Because Alberto lacked the strength

286
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:11,657
to do whatever it takes.

287
00:15:13,475 --> 00:15:15,498
He was nothing without me.

288
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,309
Hopper didn't do it.

289
00:15:21,535 --> 00:15:23,900
- <i>Are you happy now?</i>
- We gotta get Booth down here, now.

290
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,152
Yeah, we do, make the call.

291
00:15:44,307 --> 00:15:45,346
I...

292
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,491
just received the word.

293
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,320
I know.

294
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,177
What do you want me to do?

295
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:57,145
Cooperate fully.

296
00:15:58,115 --> 00:16:00,356
Let them do their song and dance.

297
00:16:00,712 --> 00:16:02,202
I'll get you out of there in an hour.

298
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,499
I mean about Julissa Garza,
she knows enough to implicate me.

299
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,125
I'll handle Julissa.

300
00:16:08,328 --> 00:16:10,241
But we have a more pressing problem.

301
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,988
Detective Hopper.

302
00:16:13,508 --> 00:16:15,995
- I'll talk to Detweiler.
- Talk to everyone.

303
00:16:17,361 --> 00:16:19,076
Detweiler, Nick Vukovic,

304
00:16:19,418 --> 00:16:21,181
Torrez and all his people.

305
00:16:21,515 --> 00:16:22,527
I understand.

306
00:16:24,249 --> 00:16:26,832
Hopper will be dead
before the day is over.

307
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,032
The important thing...

308
00:16:30,563 --> 00:16:33,816
is that nothing derails tomorrow.

309
00:16:40,181 --> 00:16:44,390
We have to send a clear message
as to who exactly runs this city.

310
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,734
I understand completely.
Yeah.

311
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:56,976
I'll be sure to pass that along.

312
00:16:58,113 --> 00:16:59,452
No. Thank <i>you</i>, sir.

313
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,286
Damn shame.

314
00:17:06,945 --> 00:17:08,859
Someone you know betrays you.

315
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:12,870
Makes you wonder
who you gotta really trust.*gotta/can ?

316
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,027
What are you talking about?

317
00:17:16,219 --> 00:17:17,257
I just got word:

318
00:17:18,519 --> 00:17:21,157
Hopper's the one who gave you up
at the safe house.

319
00:17:23,207 --> 00:17:24,218
Hop?

320
00:17:25,038 --> 00:17:26,077
You sure?

321
00:17:26,173 --> 00:17:27,417
I wish I wasn't.

322
00:17:30,248 --> 00:17:31,929
Kills me
to be the one who tell you, kid.

323
00:17:40,749 --> 00:17:41,761
Thanks.

324
00:17:43,128 --> 00:17:44,402
Good news and bad news.

325
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:47,802
Found the body in the bathtub
over your apartment, so that checks out.

326
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:50,046
But there was no one at that address
on Via Ombra.

327
00:17:50,084 --> 00:17:51,095
What?

328
00:17:51,177 --> 00:17:52,900
They must have moved Margo
somewhere else.

329
00:17:53,146 --> 00:17:55,524
They said she had to set up a meeting
for tomorrow.

330
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:56,576
A group of judges.

331
00:17:58,148 --> 00:17:59,815
If this is as big as you're claiming,

332
00:18:00,251 --> 00:18:01,727
it could lead to dozens of arrests.

333
00:18:01,728 --> 00:18:05,062
Prison officials, city councilmen,
federal prosecutors, ex-cops.

334
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:06,360
Not just ex-cops.

335
00:18:08,027 --> 00:18:09,135
Active duty too.

336
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:12,035
What do you got?

337
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:13,989
I can't prove anything yet.

338
00:18:15,889 --> 00:18:19,032
I'm gonna see if we got anything
on this... Konrad Detweiler.

339
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:20,117
Cool.

340
00:18:23,576 --> 00:18:25,544
That's a hell of a story, Hopper.

341
00:18:26,022 --> 00:18:27,339
Everybody out to get at you.

342
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:29,849
You are to get me too ?

343
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:31,045
Me?

344
00:18:31,387 --> 00:18:32,959
No, I'm just doing my job!

345
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:35,862
Does that include
planting a weapon at my place

346
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:37,827
doctoring ballistics
and faking finger prints?

347
00:18:39,317 --> 00:18:40,930
Nobody's here, it's just you and me.

348
00:18:41,026 --> 00:18:42,037
Admit it.

349
00:18:42,679 --> 00:18:44,582
The apple
doesn't fall far from the tree,

350
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,987
you're just like your old man.

351
00:18:46,014 --> 00:18:48,273
- The ego, the sheer eye dance...
- Watch your mouth!

352
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:49,458
My father was a good cop.

353
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:50,619
He was a dirty cop.

354
00:18:51,767 --> 00:18:53,995
And he dragged down
a lot of good people with him.

355
00:18:54,112 --> 00:18:56,558
Who do you think you're playing,
Spivak, you're not sleek.

356
00:18:57,652 --> 00:18:59,128
I know about the grand jury.

357
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:01,875
The subpoena.

358
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:05,650
My father did what he had to do
to protect his family.

359
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:06,689
What's your excuse?

360
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,827
You don't know a damn thing, Hopper.
Nick Vukovic is my ex-partner.

361
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:11,719
- Nick?
- That's right.

362
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,907
And your dad turned him
into the traitor he is today.

363
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:16,997
- Get the facts straight. It's the--
- That's a lot of crap, Hopper!

364
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,334
Talked to my guys in county.

365
00:19:20,633 --> 00:19:21,726
You wanna see this.

366
00:19:22,355 --> 00:19:24,217
Jackets on Fencik and Buchalter.

367
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:27,087
Ex-deputies, just like Hopper said.

368
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:32,796
You're gonna move on that, or what?

369
00:19:40,487 --> 00:19:42,018
Got a present for you too.

370
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:45,435
SID found your finger prints
on the Garza murder weapon,

371
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:47,654
- just like you said.
- Who else has seen this report?

372
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:48,797
No one.

373
00:19:49,737 --> 00:19:52,040
It was on top of Rednazki's inbox,
still sealed.

374
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,571
You stole it?

375
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,574
Borrowed it.

376
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,984
Either way,
it shouldn't have been there.

377
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,162
Any idea who gave it to us?

378
00:19:59,188 --> 00:20:01,365
I have a pretty good guess.
What's up with the widow?

379
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:04,181
Mrs. G.? She lawyered up already,
she's on her way home.

380
00:20:04,182 --> 00:20:05,217
Who's the suitor?

381
00:20:05,325 --> 00:20:06,899
The best defense guy in the city.

382
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:09,152
- Barry Coldburn.
- Yeah, how do you know?

383
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,449
That just makes sense.

384
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:13,854
- Catch up with me later.
- All right.

385
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,144
- Hello?
- <i>Detective Hopper,</i>

386
00:20:15,145 --> 00:20:16,381
this is Judge Nitzberg.

387
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:17,857
Your Honor, is everything OK?

388
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,876
<i>Well, I'm not sure.</i>

389
00:20:19,073 --> 00:20:21,786
Margo never came back from lunch,
but she left me a voice mail.

390
00:20:21,918 --> 00:20:23,482
You never saw her after I left?

391
00:20:23,553 --> 00:20:27,017
No, but she called to set a meeting
for me with the other presiding judges.

392
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,966
- <i>Is this about the grand jury?</i>
- Yes.

393
00:20:29,089 --> 00:20:31,262
They grabbed me at work. Two of them.

394
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:33,270
They wanted me to set up a meeting.

395
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,914
At the courthouse.

396
00:20:34,949 --> 00:20:36,557
- When's the meeting?
- <i>Nine o'clock.</i>

397
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,032
- Nine o'clock tonight?
- <i>No, tomorrow morning.</i>

398
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,163
Tomorrow.

399
00:20:43,715 --> 00:20:45,522
It's a long way away. I gotta go.

400
00:20:49,361 --> 00:20:50,510
I'll take him up, fellows.

401
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:52,419
Sorry, elevator's full.

402
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,097
Lose the entourage.

403
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:12,887
I'm sorry, have we met?

404
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,924
I don't know what you got planned,
but it's over.

405
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:19,377
Yeah, we broke Mrs. Garza.

406
00:21:20,103 --> 00:21:22,206
You're that detective. Right?

407
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:25,918
You forgot to tell her
about Isabella Contreras.

408
00:21:27,225 --> 00:21:28,480
How you killed the young woman.

409
00:21:29,152 --> 00:21:30,530
And her unborn child.

410
00:21:31,515 --> 00:21:34,060
<i>Your</i> unborn child.

411
00:21:34,732 --> 00:21:36,022
You think this is the first time

412
00:21:36,023 --> 00:21:38,655
I've been threatened by a detective
named Hopper?

413
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,819
Your father made threats too,
and look how that ended.

414
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,145
You don't talk about him.

415
00:21:43,392 --> 00:21:44,393
Suit yourself.

416
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:48,248
But you two have a lot more in common
than you might think.

417
00:21:51,061 --> 00:21:53,094
I have bad news for you, Detective.

418
00:21:54,331 --> 00:21:56,310
I'll be out of here in an hour
and you'll end up

419
00:21:56,311 --> 00:21:59,253
with a bullet in your head,
just like your old man.

420
00:21:59,996 --> 00:22:01,975
And just like him,

421
00:22:04,876 --> 00:22:06,290
you'll never see it coming.

422
00:22:27,263 --> 00:22:28,681
Didn't you hear me from the lobby?

423
00:22:29,586 --> 00:22:30,638
What's wrong?

424
00:22:34,528 --> 00:22:36,419
I need you to tell me everything

425
00:22:37,904 --> 00:22:40,060
that you remember about Dad's death.

426
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,305
- Why?
- I know it's hard,

427
00:22:42,306 --> 00:22:43,913
it's just... It's really important.

428
00:22:44,385 --> 00:22:46,365
Tell me exactly what you saw
when you found him.

429
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:50,818
It was a mess.

430
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:54,406
I walked in,

431
00:22:55,737 --> 00:22:56,738
and...

432
00:22:57,165 --> 00:22:58,243
I saw his body.

433
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:01,884
I tried calling Mom, tried calling you.

434
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:04,136
And then I got hold of Nick.

435
00:23:04,861 --> 00:23:05,868
What did he say?

436
00:23:06,165 --> 00:23:07,226
He was shocked.

437
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:10,690
But he came right away.
He called the police.

438
00:23:11,237 --> 00:23:12,775
He handled everything.

439
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,984
He really saved me, that day.

440
00:23:15,055 --> 00:23:16,769
Maybe you should talk to him.

441
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,857
Why are you asking me about this now?

442
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:23,056
I don't think dad killed himself.

443
00:23:25,098 --> 00:23:26,529
I think he was murdered.

444
00:23:28,411 --> 00:23:29,418
What?

445
00:23:29,806 --> 00:23:31,715
- Who?
- Wait, let me call Nick.

446
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:36,719
Nick, it's Hopper. Where are you?

447
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:44,880
- Yeah?
- Hi, Hopper.

448
00:23:46,117 --> 00:23:47,118
What do you want?

449
00:23:47,545 --> 00:23:50,637
<i>Just heard the good news, word is
you've been cleared of the Garza mess.</i>

450
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:54,209
Yeah, thanks. Listen man,
I got to meet somebody, so...

451
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:56,318
Gotta hand it to you,
I thought they had you cold.

452
00:23:56,384 --> 00:23:58,746
<i>Well, with your prints
all over the murder weapon....</i>

453
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:03,125
- Wait, what did you just say?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

454
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:05,563
Just trying to figure how the killer
got your prints

455
00:24:05,629 --> 00:24:06,800
on the gun that hit Garza.

456
00:24:06,801 --> 00:24:07,967
Wait. How did...

457
00:24:09,134 --> 00:24:11,025
Heard you've been doing
a lot of talking, Hop.

458
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,307
- Tell me about it.
- Where is Nick?

459
00:24:13,448 --> 00:24:14,968
I'm gonna need some answers first.

460
00:24:18,185 --> 00:24:19,793
<i>Do you believe in déjà vu?</i>

461
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,675
<i>Can't leave today... Over and over...</i>

462
00:24:22,676 --> 00:24:26,139
<i>I'm reminded of another time,
another place,</i>

463
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,801
<i>and a different Detective Hopper.</i>

464
00:24:27,802 --> 00:24:29,232
<i>Dad shot himself.</i>

465
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,806
<i>Where did you drag my father into?</i>

466
00:24:30,807 --> 00:24:31,934
<i>He came to me!</i>

467
00:24:31,938 --> 00:24:33,678
<i>You'll end up
with a bullet in your head,</i>

468
00:24:33,696 --> 00:24:35,340
<i>just like your old man.</i>

469
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,432
<i>And just like him,</i>

470
00:24:40,235 --> 00:24:41,649
<i>you'll never see it coming.</i>

471
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:10,630
<i>Brett. Oh my God!
We've been trying to reach you.</i>

472
00:25:10,806 --> 00:25:12,830
Yeah, baby, I'm sorry, I'm...

473
00:25:13,593 --> 00:25:14,995
I'm OK.

474
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:16,032
<i>I was so worried.<i>

475
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,082
<i>I thought after everything
that happened...</i>

476
00:25:18,213 --> 00:25:20,620
No, I'm all right. You just hold tight.

477
00:25:20,705 --> 00:25:23,076
<i>This morning, when you weren't here,
I called the station.</i>

478
00:25:24,545 --> 00:25:25,838
Wait, hold on, What d'you...

479
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:27,001
What did you just say?

480
00:25:27,028 --> 00:25:28,463
<i>I said I called the station.</i>

481
00:25:28,752 --> 00:25:30,720
No, before that. Before that.

482
00:25:31,828 --> 00:25:33,227
Did you say this morning?

483
00:25:33,391 --> 00:25:35,209
<i>Yeah. Brett, what's going on?</i>

484
00:25:35,388 --> 00:25:36,864
<i>You sound really strange.</i>

485
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:41,792
- Rita, what time is it?
- <i>What? I don't know.</i>

486
00:25:41,961 --> 00:25:43,038
What time is it?

487
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,492
<i>Ten after seven.</i>

488
00:25:58,153 --> 00:25:59,260
It's tomorrow.

489
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,854
I don't understand it, how...

490
00:26:14,763 --> 00:26:16,327
it happened. I don't know...

491
00:26:16,401 --> 00:26:17,866
What do you mean? What happened?

492
00:26:18,538 --> 00:26:19,768
No. All this stuff...

493
00:26:20,006 --> 00:26:22,643
All this stuff happened yesterday,
but it's like it's finally...

494
00:26:22,734 --> 00:26:24,641
The city's about
to go up in flames, Hop.

495
00:26:25,003 --> 00:26:27,175
You have no idea how big this is,
do you?

496
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:28,488
They grabbed me at work.

497
00:26:28,584 --> 00:26:30,101
They wanted me to set up a meeting.

498
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,876
- When's the meeting?
- Tomorrow morning.

499
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,261
Tomorrow...

500
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,030
It's a long way away.

501
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:37,744
It's like yesterday's thing
was a set-up.

502
00:26:37,745 --> 00:26:39,165
Yesterday was a set up until...

503
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,794
Baby, I get out of here, all right?

504
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,337
Wait. Where are you?
Chad's been asking for you.

505
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:46,728
- When?
- This morning.

506
00:26:46,729 --> 00:26:48,153
He's on his way over right now.

507
00:26:52,676 --> 00:26:54,548
I trust no one, so are you.

508
00:26:55,511 --> 00:26:56,920
No, but we have a problem.

509
00:26:57,961 --> 00:26:59,478
Hopper knows about Rita's Dad.

510
00:26:59,596 --> 00:27:02,172
- And how did that happen?
- Does it matter?

511
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:05,202
I've given you what you wanted.

512
00:27:05,203 --> 00:27:06,809
You need to take care of them.

513
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:09,724
She won't say anything,
it's Hopper we...

514
00:27:09,725 --> 00:27:13,100
You need to take care of them.

515
00:27:15,104 --> 00:27:16,115
Not going there.

516
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,651
Yes. Yes, we are.

517
00:27:18,598 --> 00:27:20,442
A reckoning has come today, Sergeant.

518
00:27:20,443 --> 00:27:22,325
Our slates are being wiped clean.

519
00:27:24,451 --> 00:27:25,856
I'll kill you right now.

520
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:27,157
She'd still die.

521
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:31,088
I'm afraid you have a decision to make.

522
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,783
<i>Hi. You reached
the offices
of Alan Nitzberg.</i>

523
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,052
<i>Neither his Honou
nor his assistant, Margo...</i>

524
00:27:43,681 --> 00:27:46,194
My fellow Justices of the Court,

525
00:27:46,563 --> 00:27:49,102
our legal system is under attack, today.

526
00:27:51,554 --> 00:27:53,672
The death of Alberto Garza

527
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:55,832
was just a warning shot.

528
00:27:57,457 --> 00:27:59,083
It was a sign that said:

529
00:27:59,179 --> 00:28:00,832
"No one is safe."

530
00:28:02,969 --> 00:28:04,415
It was a sign that said:

531
00:28:04,497 --> 00:28:05,877
"We run the System,

532
00:28:06,055 --> 00:28:08,911
"we will intimidate you,
we will disgrace you,

533
00:28:10,189 --> 00:28:12,615
"we will find your darkest secrets."

534
00:28:14,015 --> 00:28:15,125
These men,

535
00:28:15,783 --> 00:28:17,833
led by councilman Tobias Booth,

536
00:28:18,561 --> 00:28:20,481
try to tell <i>me</i>
how the System is running,

537
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,162
that I'd better get on board.

538
00:28:23,013 --> 00:28:24,381
I told the councilman

539
00:28:24,476 --> 00:28:26,879
his version of justice isn't mine.

540
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:28,301
Isn't ours.

541
00:28:32,363 --> 00:28:33,941
This isn't about justice.

542
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,622
It's about a corrupt few
controling the many.

543
00:28:41,347 --> 00:28:43,308
This is about power.

544
00:28:45,442 --> 00:28:46,481
My friends,

545
00:28:47,495 --> 00:28:50,557
<i>this</i> is where we draw the line,

546
00:28:51,517 --> 00:28:53,403
and make our last stand.

547
00:28:55,175 --> 00:28:56,241
We're in position.

548
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:02,347
Now.

549
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:03,712
It's all yours.

550
00:29:04,378 --> 00:29:05,567
Make it ugly.

551
00:29:40,517 --> 00:29:41,546
You OK?

552
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:45,315
Yeah. I'm fine.

553
00:29:48,158 --> 00:29:51,648
Look, Rita. This is gonna sound crazy,
but you're in danger.

554
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:55,723
We need to leave.
We need to get out of town right now.

555
00:29:55,913 --> 00:29:56,938
What?

556
00:29:56,992 --> 00:29:58,892
Those people that helped us out
with your dad,

557
00:29:58,906 --> 00:30:00,067
they're gonna come after us.

558
00:30:00,861 --> 00:30:02,883
They made unacceptable demands.

559
00:30:03,072 --> 00:30:04,380
How do you know that?

560
00:30:04,418 --> 00:30:05,627
Because they told me.

561
00:30:05,749 --> 00:30:08,079
I tried to talk them out of it.
I did something for them.

562
00:30:08,146 --> 00:30:10,196
Look, I'm just trying
to take care of you, here.

563
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:14,838
Don't stop on my account.

564
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,815
No, for real.
I can't wait to hear the rest.

565
00:30:22,003 --> 00:30:23,325
So, it wasn't Spivak.

566
00:30:24,404 --> 00:30:25,411
It was you.

567
00:30:28,652 --> 00:30:30,666
You switched the ballistics
and the prints.

568
00:30:32,068 --> 00:30:33,179
What are you talking about?

569
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:36,386
Andrea got to the results
before anybody else saw them at SID.

570
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:40,003
So the only person that would have known
that those were my prints on the gun...

571
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:42,757
was the person who planted the report.

572
00:30:43,178 --> 00:30:44,737
Is that true, Chad?

573
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,879
I understand what you did
with Rita's father,

574
00:30:46,966 --> 00:30:48,439
so they threatened you with that.

575
00:30:48,911 --> 00:30:51,780
But something tells me
that's not why you set me up.

576
00:30:51,798 --> 00:30:53,186
- Brett, don't...
- Rita, please.

577
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,321
I think you did it 'cause you wanted to.

578
00:30:56,973 --> 00:31:00,512
I think you set me up because Rita
is with me and not with you.

579
00:31:01,535 --> 00:31:02,992
You never deserved her.

580
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:04,568
You still don't.

581
00:31:05,995 --> 00:31:08,780
I don't know what you see
in this back stabbing son of a bitch.

582
00:31:08,781 --> 00:31:10,401
He stole you away from me.

583
00:31:10,632 --> 00:31:11,645
Chad...

584
00:31:12,246 --> 00:31:13,919
He didn't steel me.

585
00:31:15,113 --> 00:31:16,332
You lost me.

586
00:31:19,061 --> 00:31:20,125
Don't say that.

587
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:21,498
Did you hear what she said?

588
00:31:23,082 --> 00:31:24,279
You lost her.

589
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:25,910
It's on you, Chad.

590
00:31:27,936 --> 00:31:29,188
And always has been.

591
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:52,764
Oh, my God!

592
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,464
Stop it!

593
00:32:11,805 --> 00:32:12,852
It's over.

594
00:34:11,213 --> 00:34:12,458
Barry Coldburn.

595
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,578
Sorry, have we met?

596
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:16,510
Brett Hopper. I think you heard of me.

597
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:20,414
You were that cop.

598
00:34:21,147 --> 00:34:23,686
The one who was accused
of killing Garza.

599
00:34:24,069 --> 00:34:25,445
What can I do for you?

600
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:26,990
I know what you did.

601
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,125
You're not gonna get away with it.

602
00:34:29,211 --> 00:34:30,682
Putting a hand on the judges,

603
00:34:31,014 --> 00:34:32,038
killing Garza,

604
00:34:32,624 --> 00:34:33,627
framing me...

605
00:34:34,571 --> 00:34:37,528
Those are some pretty outlandish
charges, detective.

606
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:41,421
Do you have even a shred of evidence
to support them?

607
00:34:41,422 --> 00:34:42,434
Not yet.

608
00:34:42,863 --> 00:34:45,370
But it's no coincidence
your name keeps popping up.

609
00:34:45,567 --> 00:34:47,730
The Santyana Club,
your connection to Booth...

610
00:34:47,816 --> 00:34:48,966
Mrs. Garza...

611
00:34:49,097 --> 00:34:51,405
You even defended my girlfriend
four years ago.

612
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:52,624
Really?

613
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,092
- How did I do?
- You made it go away,

614
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,018
just like you make
all your problems go away...

615
00:34:58,465 --> 00:34:59,598
until this time.

616
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:01,674
Something went wrong.

617
00:35:02,756 --> 00:35:04,190
Judge Nitzberg.

618
00:35:14,385 --> 00:35:16,155
Hypothetical situation:

619
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,750
Let's say you're the top cop
in the department.

620
00:35:20,195 --> 00:35:23,731
Under your regime, crime is down,
streets are safer,

621
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:25,680
and bad guys get put away.

622
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,908
How hard would you fight
to keep it that way?

623
00:35:29,681 --> 00:35:31,140
If it were you, Hopper,

624
00:35:31,346 --> 00:35:32,891
if this was your city,

625
00:35:33,555 --> 00:35:35,186
would you let other men,

626
00:35:35,958 --> 00:35:37,538
<i>lesser</i> men,

627
00:35:37,589 --> 00:35:39,855
dictate how justice's
supposed to be carried out?

628
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:44,276
Would you let them take apart a system
that's been in place for decades?

629
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:46,320
A system that works?

630
00:35:46,758 --> 00:35:48,080
That you built?

631
00:35:48,543 --> 00:35:51,410
Would you let one man ruin all that?

632
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:54,843
You brought this whole thing down
because one judge said no to you?

633
00:35:54,963 --> 00:35:55,976
Please...

634
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,605
You don't care about Nitzberg
or Garza or any of this.

635
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:02,099
Why don't you ask me the question
you came to ask?

636
00:36:02,151 --> 00:36:03,490
What question is that?

637
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:05,367
You wanna know what happened
to you father.

638
00:36:05,368 --> 00:36:07,044
I know what happened to my father.

639
00:36:07,086 --> 00:36:08,099
He was murdered.

640
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,352
But who did it?

641
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:13,268
My professional opinion
as a defense attorney:

642
00:36:13,783 --> 00:36:17,629
homicides are mostly committed
by those closest to the victim.

643
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,577
A spouse, a sibling...

644
00:36:20,573 --> 00:36:21,588
A partner...

645
00:36:22,566 --> 00:36:24,695
That person often feels soon guilt.

646
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,012
Gets close to the family,

647
00:36:27,172 --> 00:36:29,249
helps them out in their time of need.

648
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:31,978
Do you know anyone
who fits that description, detective?

649
00:36:37,745 --> 00:36:39,341
It's one hell of a city.

650
00:36:40,749 --> 00:36:44,045
I think you'll find
that the system works...

651
00:36:45,152 --> 00:36:46,820
just as it is.

652
00:36:47,165 --> 00:36:49,912
The fact that your name was cleared
proves my point.

653
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,262
And now, if you'll forgive me,

654
00:36:53,426 --> 00:36:55,170
my family is waiting for me.

655
00:37:01,455 --> 00:37:02,456
Coldburn!

656
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,462
This isn't over.

657
00:37:08,842 --> 00:37:09,935
Today, it is.

658
00:37:40,331 --> 00:37:41,343
Hop.

659
00:37:41,794 --> 00:37:42,805
D.

660
00:37:45,838 --> 00:37:47,875
Gotta say I judged you wrong,
last night.

661
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,849
I got some bad intel.

662
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,926
I heard you sold me out.

663
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:56,103
Something didn't feel right.

664
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:58,404
So I had a little chat with Baxter.

665
00:37:59,238 --> 00:38:01,521
Turns out, you and me,
we both got played.

666
00:38:02,484 --> 00:38:03,782
I could have told you that.

667
00:38:07,149 --> 00:38:08,434
I know that, now.

668
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,550
I could have ended you, Hop.

669
00:38:13,495 --> 00:38:14,602
But I didn't.

670
00:38:16,768 --> 00:38:18,497
I wanna believe in the family, now.

671
00:38:20,233 --> 00:38:21,641
So I want a clean slate.

672
00:38:23,451 --> 00:38:24,626
Make piece.

673
00:38:26,057 --> 00:38:27,506
I brought you something.

674
00:38:37,368 --> 00:38:38,372
Get out.

675
00:38:45,073 --> 00:38:46,672
I don't know what's going on.

676
00:38:49,392 --> 00:38:51,784
See, this <i>chota,</i>
he tried to sell me out to Booth,

677
00:38:52,153 --> 00:38:53,882
then turn us against each other.

678
00:38:54,975 --> 00:38:57,121
So I say he's lost his right to breathe.

679
00:38:57,573 --> 00:39:00,006
- What do you think?
- Don't listen to him, Brett!

680
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:02,343
- You know me!
- I know you killed him, Nick.

681
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:08,003
- What? Are you crazy?
- Why did you do it?

682
00:39:08,498 --> 00:39:10,165
Please, Brett, it's not what you think.

683
00:39:10,192 --> 00:39:11,818
Why did you do it?

684
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,479
It was the Contreras case.

685
00:39:19,421 --> 00:39:21,048
He was gonna bring it all down!

686
00:39:21,049 --> 00:39:22,628
You put the gun in his mouth.

687
00:39:22,655 --> 00:39:26,099
He had no idea
what those people are capable of!

688
00:39:26,413 --> 00:39:28,141
They would have killed your mom!

689
00:39:28,162 --> 00:39:30,478
- Your sister!
- You pulled the trigger.

690
00:39:30,808 --> 00:39:33,362
- I did it for you.
- No you didn't!

691
00:39:37,724 --> 00:39:38,735
You did it for you.

692
00:39:39,036 --> 00:39:41,066
I had no choice!

693
00:39:58,633 --> 00:40:00,259
There's always a choice.

694
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,389
Where are you going?

695
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:10,776
Brett! Don't leave!

696
00:40:13,892 --> 00:40:14,896
Think of you fa...

697
00:40:17,151 --> 00:40:18,156
I do.

698
00:40:18,996 --> 00:40:20,090
Every day.

699
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,590
Hey, buddy!

700
00:41:10,943 --> 00:41:11,957
Rambis!

701
00:41:13,091 --> 00:41:14,254
Take this.

702
00:41:21,928 --> 00:41:23,247
What made you wanna

703
00:41:23,488 --> 00:41:25,106
finally stay at your place?

704
00:41:27,239 --> 00:41:28,882
I thought we could use a change.

705
00:41:33,397 --> 00:41:34,783
You need new pillows.

706
00:41:36,227 --> 00:41:38,019
