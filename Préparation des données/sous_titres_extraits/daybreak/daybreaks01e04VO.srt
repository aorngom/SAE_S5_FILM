00:00:11,529 --> 00:00:13,820
<i>My name is detective Brett Hopper,</i>

3
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:16,718
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

4
00:00:17,076 --> 00:00:17,904
Freeze!

5
00:00:18,042 --> 00:00:21,193
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

6
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:23,298
<i>I will be framed for murder...</i>

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:25,238
Who the hell are you people?

8
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:27,228
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

9
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:30,885
<i>I know all this because I am living
the same day...</i>

10
00:00:31,242 --> 00:00:33,137
<i>over and over again.</i>

11
00:00:33,202 --> 00:00:36,210
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

12
00:00:36,614 --> 00:00:38,255
<i>Every morning, I get another chance.</i>

13
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,791
For every decision,
there's a consequence.

14
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:42,540
<i>I can save my sister Jennifer...</i>

15
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,060
- You're acting really crazy.
- There isn't any time!

16
00:00:45,117 --> 00:00:45,991
What is this about?

17
00:00:46,029 --> 00:00:47,778
<i>I can track down every lead.</i>

18
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:50,901
<i>Hopper, you should have received
a package today.</i>

19
00:00:51,173 --> 00:00:53,284
The message on your answerphone
came from the home

20
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,651
of a U.S. Attorney, Nathan Baxter.

21
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:56,523
Anything else you're not telling me,
partner?

22
00:00:56,772 --> 00:00:58,402
<i>But today, I need some answers...</i>

23
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:00,513
You called and left me a message
about this package.

24
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,263
- Who told you to call me?
- Garza.

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,803
<i>... before it's too late.</i>

26
00:01:04,859 --> 00:01:07,293
If I get here earlier tomorrow,
I might be able to help her.

27
00:01:07,349 --> 00:01:09,682
<i>Hopper, I need your help.</i>
I've done something terrible.

28
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:18,261
I love you.

29
00:01:19,436 --> 00:01:20,508
I love you, too.

30
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:22,261
When will I see you again?

31
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,418
Tomorrow.

32
00:01:26,592 --> 00:01:27,495
I'll see you tomorrow.

33
00:01:33,066 --> 00:01:34,819
- Rita?
- Hopper, I need your help.

34
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,087
I've done something terrible.

35
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,389
Andrea?

36
00:01:39,815 --> 00:01:41,040
Tell me what happened.

37
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:42,784
It's Eddie...

38
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,614
I think I killed him.

39
00:01:54,786 --> 00:01:56,403
Okay, why don't you take me through it?

40
00:01:57,543 --> 00:01:58,394
He came over.

41
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:00,189
He was high.

42
00:02:01,108 --> 00:02:02,555
He was tweaking so bad.

43
00:02:02,981 --> 00:02:04,768
He got violent and...

44
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:06,878
I fought back.

45
00:02:07,934 --> 00:02:08,717
And...

46
00:02:09,721 --> 00:02:11,653
he went... over.

47
00:02:23,256 --> 00:02:24,634
God, he's dead!

48
00:02:24,822 --> 00:02:26,915
- This is my fault.
- No, no, it's not.

49
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:29,111
We both knew what Eddie was into.

50
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:30,965
I didn't mean to kill him.

51
00:02:31,084 --> 00:02:32,838
Just stop it. He brought this here.

52
00:02:33,842 --> 00:02:35,033
You were defending yourself.

53
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:37,356
We're gonna fix this.

54
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:44,930
We'll leave him at his apartment.

55
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:48,687
There's a pay phone around the corner.
We can call 9-1-1 from there.

56
00:02:51,002 --> 00:02:52,007
You okay?

57
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,274
I know you've got problems
of your own, Hopper.

58
00:02:57,145 --> 00:02:59,035
I just didn't know where else to turn.

59
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,720
He was my partner, too.

60
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,128
When was the last time
you talked to him?

61
00:03:05,204 --> 00:03:06,522
Couple of months, maybe.

62
00:03:07,502 --> 00:03:08,871
You know if he was still using?

63
00:03:09,171 --> 00:03:10,107
I don't know.

64
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:11,910
I mean, how long did we work with him

65
00:03:11,944 --> 00:03:13,715
before either of us realized, right?

66
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:16,780
Yeah. Eddie had his secr...

67
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:20,535
I didn't feel a pulse, I swear to God!

68
00:03:21,054 --> 00:03:23,317
- Hang in there, man.
- We gotta get him to a hospital.

69
00:03:23,454 --> 00:03:25,105
St. Francis is the closest one,

70
00:03:25,122 --> 00:03:27,045
- but it's the other way.
- St. Francis. Okay.

71
00:03:31,954 --> 00:03:33,299
You're gonna be okay, man.

72
00:03:47,774 --> 00:03:48,778
- I can lose him.
- No!

73
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,322
No, if we run, he'll have a bird on us
in minutes.

74
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:53,360
I don't think Eddie's got minutes.

75
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:55,935
So we can't waste 'em by going nascar
against a black and white.

76
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:58,156
Just be cool.
All right, hang in there, man.

77
00:03:58,215 --> 00:04:00,002
We're gonna get you some help. Hang in.

78
00:04:07,299 --> 00:04:09,991
Narcotics. These are my partners.
We're on the job.

79
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:12,364
What happened to him?

80
00:04:12,534 --> 00:04:15,071
He was UC on a buy bust.
Took a hit from a couple of bangers.

81
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:16,320
We're taking him to a hospital.

82
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,167
Let's go.
We've got an injured officer here.

83
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:20,757
61-14, I've got an injured officer

84
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:23,005
at Alvarado and Glendale
with his partners.

85
00:04:23,191 --> 00:04:25,333
Show me escorting
to St. Francis Memorial Hospital.

86
00:04:25,476 --> 00:04:26,761
Code three. Follow me.

87
00:04:30,788 --> 00:04:32,091
You know I can't go in there.

88
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:33,269
I know.

89
00:04:33,711 --> 00:04:35,703
I know. I got this.

90
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,113
Need help over here!

91
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:45,423
Come on, this side, this side!

92
00:04:48,257 --> 00:04:49,465
Where's your other partner?

93
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:21,617
- Hey.
- I didn't even hear you get up.

94
00:05:21,618 --> 00:05:24,954
- I just... I didn't want to wake you.
- I like when you wake me.

95
00:05:25,014 --> 00:05:27,516
Now you're all dressed,
and I've missed all the good parts.

96
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:31,022
That's a good part, too.

97
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,812
Baby girl, I'm trying to get
an early start.

98
00:05:36,814 --> 00:05:38,722
But save me some of that for later,
all right?

99
00:05:39,563 --> 00:05:41,674
Well, later it might be all gone.

100
00:05:43,537 --> 00:05:45,409
Sweetie, it was... It was just a joke.

101
00:05:46,268 --> 00:05:47,715
Oh, no, I know. I just...

102
00:05:48,964 --> 00:05:50,122
I got a...

103
00:05:50,164 --> 00:05:51,492
I got a lot on my mind.

104
00:05:51,773 --> 00:05:53,134
You wanna tell me about it?

105
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,164
It's Andrea.

106
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:59,449
I think she may be caught up
in something with Eddie Reyes.

107
00:05:59,534 --> 00:06:00,505
- Eddie?
- Yeah.

108
00:06:00,538 --> 00:06:02,427
I haven't heard his name
since he got fired.

109
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,147
Well, he popped up yesterday.

110
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,482
So what exactly are those two
caught up in?

111
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,333
I don't know.

112
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,523
Trying to figure that out.

113
00:06:09,897 --> 00:06:11,796
Eddie's had a rough time of it.

114
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:13,872
I hope he's not in any more trouble.

115
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:14,709
Please.

116
00:06:14,816 --> 00:06:16,446
Eddie ain't nothing but trouble.

117
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:17,450
I gotta go.

118
00:06:17,841 --> 00:06:20,088
I have to see this lady about a package.

119
00:06:20,402 --> 00:06:22,751
- Lady?
- It's evidence.

120
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:26,214
Might be important.

121
00:06:46,549 --> 00:06:47,536
- Battle.
<i>- Hey.</i>

122
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:49,561
<i>I know this is a little bit
sudden.</i>

123
00:06:49,603 --> 00:06:51,118
You gotta stay away from Eddie today.

124
00:06:51,186 --> 00:06:53,024
Hopper, what the hell
are you talking about?

125
00:06:53,126 --> 00:06:55,645
I think he's using again.
Listen, if he calls,

126
00:06:56,037 --> 00:06:56,786
<i>don't pick up.</i>

127
00:06:56,845 --> 00:06:58,888
<i>If he comes over, do not let him in.</i>

128
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:01,032
- Where are you getting this?
- Just trust me.

129
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,687
Stay away from Eddie today. Okay?

130
00:07:04,035 --> 00:07:05,397
Okay, yeah, I got it.

131
00:07:12,929 --> 00:07:13,968
Who was that?

132
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:15,601
Hopper.

133
00:07:17,277 --> 00:07:19,056
He says I should stay away from you.

134
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,350
Typical Hopper.

135
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,395
All I'm saying is, why today?

136
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:36,235
The same day that you gotta go to I.A,

137
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,057
he calls out of the blue
to talk about me.

138
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:40,354
He must know something.

139
00:07:40,392 --> 00:07:42,502
Then why didn't he say something
about us?

140
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,781
He did. He said to stay away from me.

141
00:07:46,201 --> 00:07:48,043
You know how Hopper
gets an idea in his head.

142
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:49,040
He can't let it go.

143
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,869
You mean like, how he got me canned?

144
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:53,992
Come on.

145
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,183
You know that's not true.

146
00:07:57,886 --> 00:07:59,513
Thought you were on my side.

147
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,986
I am.

148
00:08:01,274 --> 00:08:02,597
Come on, baby.

149
00:08:04,248 --> 00:08:05,869
I'm just worried about you, you know?

150
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,080
You just said so yourself...

151
00:08:07,127 --> 00:08:09,932
Hopper gets an idea in his head,
he doesn't let it go.

152
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,075
He's going to I.A. today, too,

153
00:08:12,892 --> 00:08:15,237
and what if he knows
what you've been doing?

154
00:08:15,631 --> 00:08:17,468
- He doesn't.
- Then why he call this morning

155
00:08:17,524 --> 00:08:19,513
and tell you to stay away from me?

156
00:08:24,622 --> 00:08:26,521
Is there something
you're not telling me?

157
00:08:26,685 --> 00:08:27,750
Like what?

158
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,611
Come on, baby, of course not.

159
00:08:31,749 --> 00:08:33,925
You've seen me at my worst,

160
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:35,750
spun out.

161
00:08:37,748 --> 00:08:39,865
There's nothing I can hide from you.

162
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:50,887
Hey, how about I take you
to la <i>Cabañita<i> tonight?

163
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,116
You know you don't have to.

164
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:55,118
I'd like to.
Even a rent-a-cop can afford that.

165
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:13,558
<i>They played me some voice mail,</i>

166
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,936
<i>a woman talking about
some package they sent to you.</i>

167
00:09:16,008 --> 00:09:17,496
<i>They think it is tied to Garza.</i>

168
00:09:17,497 --> 00:09:20,555
You called and left me a message
about this package.

169
00:10:20,068 --> 00:10:23,078
- Ava, I'm Brett Hopper.
- How did you find me?

170
00:10:23,181 --> 00:10:25,076
Don't worry about that. Where's Baxter?

171
00:10:25,639 --> 00:10:26,879
He's in the shower.

172
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,857
Now I know that you work for Garza.

173
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:34,130
I know that he had you send me
a package. I need to know why.

174
00:10:34,365 --> 00:10:35,668
Garza never told me.

175
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:40,332
Why are you asking me, anyway?
Why don't you just talk to him ?

176
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:41,748
Garza's dead.

177
00:10:43,313 --> 00:10:44,779
He was killed last night.

178
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,792
My God. When?
I mean, why would anybody...

179
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,886
Right now I'm trying
to figure all that out, but

180
00:10:50,989 --> 00:10:53,709
I think it may have something to do
with that package you sent me.

181
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:55,539
I need you to tell me everything.

182
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,470
Garza was acting nervous.

183
00:10:57,499 --> 00:10:59,666
When he brought the packages,
they were both sealed.

184
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:01,984
I didn't see what was inside.
He just said to send them.

185
00:11:02,049 --> 00:11:04,391
- There were two packages?
- You didn't know?

186
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:07,877
Yeah, I sent one to you
and one to someone...

187
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,251
someone named... Mathis.

188
00:11:12,175 --> 00:11:13,502
Jennifer Mathis?

189
00:11:14,703 --> 00:11:15,773
You know her?

190
00:11:17,002 --> 00:11:20,725
She's my sister. Put your clothes on
and get the hell out of here.

191
00:11:20,772 --> 00:11:22,179
You're in danger, too.

192
00:11:23,251 --> 00:11:24,780
And stay away from Baxter.

193
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:39,751
<i>- Wait, so you never received a package?</i>
- No, I haven't gotten anything.

194
00:11:39,846 --> 00:11:42,314
You never got it.
<i>Your husband must have taken it.</i>

195
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:44,972
- Randall?
- Tell Randall I'm coming to see him.

196
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:46,497
<i>Brett, that doesn't...</i>
He's not here.

197
00:11:46,498 --> 00:11:48,748
Where is he?
<i>He left work and went home.</i>

198
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,313
<i>He got a call.</i>
Our alarm went off.

199
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:51,725
<i>- What?</i>
- No, it's okay.

200
00:11:51,814 --> 00:11:53,749
- It happens by mistake...
- Stay there.

201
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,044
I'm coming to get you.

202
00:12:04,822 --> 00:12:06,562
Hey. You were supposed
to be at work.

203
00:12:06,563 --> 00:12:09,266
I was worried about you,
after your I.A. meeting, you know?

204
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,480
Hopper calling this morning and all.

205
00:12:11,621 --> 00:12:13,122
So what did you tell 'em?

206
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:17,049
Slow down, slow down. They know what?

207
00:12:17,381 --> 00:12:19,754
About Slim... everything,

208
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,788
okay? They've got pictures
and bank statements.

209
00:12:23,508 --> 00:12:25,835
I don't know
what I'm gonna do here, Eddie.

210
00:12:26,689 --> 00:12:29,452
- They say anything about me?
- This is my ass we're talking about.

211
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,906
Come on, don't be that way, baby.

212
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:33,861
- Hopper's the one who did this to us.
- This wasn't Hopper,

213
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:36,210
okay? Hopper's wanted for murder.

214
00:12:37,354 --> 00:12:40,032
- What?
- They say he killed the A.D.A, Garza,

215
00:12:40,163 --> 00:12:41,946
and they want me to help bring him in.

216
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,120
Offered me a deal.

217
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,852
I roll on Hopper and they drop the case.

218
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,920
- What're you gonna do?
- It's my partner.

219
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:50,180
What if he did it?

220
00:12:50,356 --> 00:12:53,123
Then you help bring down a murderer,
and you walk away clean.

221
00:12:53,228 --> 00:12:55,219
- And what if he didn't?
- Well, then you help

222
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:57,340
prove his innocence, right?
And everybody wins.

223
00:12:57,566 --> 00:12:59,354
- Eddie, I can't...
- No, baby, no.

224
00:12:59,504 --> 00:13:01,437
You take this deal, I.A. Goes away.

225
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:04,390
Slim goes away.
I can try and clear my record.

226
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:07,189
I mean, this could be
a second chance for both of us.

227
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,592
I didn't roll on you and I'm not
gonna do it to Hopper.

228
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,124
Do you always side with that guy?

229
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:13,988
They just told you he killed somebody
and yet you're still backing him.

230
00:13:14,007 --> 00:13:14,814
What about us?

231
00:13:17,939 --> 00:13:19,469
Why are you looking at me like that?

232
00:13:19,563 --> 00:13:20,649
Are you using again?

233
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:23,375
You think I'd do that to myself, to you,

234
00:13:23,478 --> 00:13:26,611
- after everything you've done?
- It's just a question.

235
00:13:27,786 --> 00:13:29,471
It's a question Hopper put there, right?

236
00:13:29,543 --> 00:13:31,099
That's what he told you this morning.

237
00:13:31,194 --> 00:13:34,074
So he doesn't just get me fired,
he gets to ruin us.

238
00:13:35,046 --> 00:13:37,693
Probably just take his side
on that one, too?

239
00:13:41,315 --> 00:13:44,795
Randall, it's me again. Call me.

240
00:13:47,419 --> 00:13:48,595
This isn't like him.

241
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:52,599
<i>I'm gonna kill him.</i>

242
00:13:53,857 --> 00:13:54,858
What?

243
00:13:54,914 --> 00:13:57,288
- Nothing.
- Don't "nothing" me.

244
00:13:57,575 --> 00:14:00,443
You pull me out of class, you drag me
home and you won't even tell me

245
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:03,825
- what the hell's going on.
- I would if I knew, but for now...

246
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:05,280
you're safer with me.

247
00:14:05,524 --> 00:14:06,524
Safer?

248
00:14:06,928 --> 00:14:08,271
What are you talking about?

249
00:14:08,362 --> 00:14:10,115
Are we in some kind of danger?

250
00:14:11,032 --> 00:14:12,683
- Is Randall?
- I don't know!

251
00:14:12,794 --> 00:14:14,418
I can totally tell when you're lying...

252
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:17,166
I just wish you'd be
a little bit more worried about yourself

253
00:14:17,203 --> 00:14:19,041
and a little less about your husband.

254
00:14:19,173 --> 00:14:20,865
What is that supposed to mean?

255
00:14:24,899 --> 00:14:26,010
It's Randall's car.

256
00:14:32,047 --> 00:14:33,269
Jen, wait! Let...

257
00:14:34,431 --> 00:14:36,117
Let me check the house first.

258
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:40,173
- Hopper, we need to talk.
<i>- Yeah, I...</i>

259
00:14:40,204 --> 00:14:41,941
I'm a little busy right now, Andrea.

260
00:14:41,982 --> 00:14:44,739
Look, you called me this morning, okay?
I need your help!

261
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,244
Andrea, I gotta call you back.

262
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:08,679
The whole place is tossed.
Nobody's here.

263
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:11,972
Why would anybody do this to us?

264
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:15,953
I think they're
looking for that package.

265
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:18,305
Do you think they have Randall?

266
00:15:18,761 --> 00:15:19,911
Forget Randall.

267
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:21,540
- What?
- For all we know,

268
00:15:21,548 --> 00:15:23,215
he could be involved in this.

269
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:24,811
What is wrong with you?

270
00:15:25,144 --> 00:15:28,498
My house is turned upside down,
my husband is missing

271
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,780
and all you can say
is that maybe it's his fault?

272
00:15:30,811 --> 00:15:33,217
All I'm saying
is that it's a possibility.

273
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,488
You never liked him.

274
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:36,993
You always assume the worst in people.

275
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:39,747
I'm following my instincts, all right?
It's my job.

276
00:15:39,811 --> 00:15:41,290
That's right, your instincts.

277
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:43,239
That's why
I don't hear from you for a month!

278
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,098
That's why
you missed your niece's birthday!

279
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:47,028
What are you talking about right now?

280
00:15:47,078 --> 00:15:50,047
Look, I'm sorry if I don't have time
for the perfect family

281
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:52,411
- and the perfect life...
- It's not about being perfect.

282
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,067
It is about being there!

283
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:57,485
That's why your relationship with mom

284
00:15:57,525 --> 00:15:59,842
- is so screwed up...
- What? My relationsh...

285
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,310
You keep turning her against me.
That's what's wrong

286
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,178
- with ma!
- Right! It's never your fault.

287
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:05,926
You are just like dad.

288
00:16:07,764 --> 00:16:09,340
You wanna play it like that?

289
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,774
Where'd you get these bruises
on your arm, Jennifer?

290
00:16:12,824 --> 00:16:14,168
Where'd you get those?

291
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:16,400
- What?
- What? Yeah, I know about 'em.

292
00:16:16,441 --> 00:16:17,713
You don't understand.

293
00:16:17,966 --> 00:16:18,966
You don't!

294
00:16:33,954 --> 00:16:35,251
Wha... Brett?

295
00:17:07,741 --> 00:17:10,387
- Randall, how did they find me?
- I don't know, Brett!

296
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:12,125
- Did you tell 'em?
- No, I swear to god

297
00:17:12,155 --> 00:17:15,498
I didn't tell 'em! They took me,
and then they were gonna get Jen,

298
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,826
and they looked at that thing
on the dash and they knew.

299
00:17:17,856 --> 00:17:19,792
I think it's a GPS or something.

300
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,261
What the hell are you doing?

301
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,228
Where is the package?

302
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:28,282
- What did you do with it?
- I don't know any...

303
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,300
I don't believe you!

304
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,400
Stop it! Let him go!

305
00:17:30,421 --> 00:17:32,173
I'm going to count to three,
you hear me?

306
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,218
One...

307
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,360
Two...

308
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:36,297
- Please don't...
- I have it!

309
00:17:38,954 --> 00:17:39,975
I hid it...

310
00:17:40,571 --> 00:17:41,591
okay?

311
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:49,197
I was scared.

312
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,480
I got a call ;
they said "Don't tell anyone"

313
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:53,379
and I opened it and I saw that.

314
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,076
- Do you know who this woman is?
- No.

315
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:59,571
I thought it was
some kind of threat, so I hid it.

316
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:01,056
I didn't even tell Randall.

317
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,087
Jen, I'm a cop.
This is what I deal with.

318
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:04,248
I can protect you.

319
00:18:05,894 --> 00:18:07,743
- Why didn't you ask me for help?
- I tried.

320
00:18:07,783 --> 00:18:10,161
- When?
- Last night. I called you six times.

321
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:12,517
And I called you back. You said
your phone was broken.

322
00:18:12,518 --> 00:18:13,746
- What?
- Yes!

323
00:18:13,787 --> 00:18:15,271
You never called me back.

324
00:18:17,676 --> 00:18:18,878
The cops are coming.

325
00:18:19,342 --> 00:18:21,009
Get the hell off my property.

326
00:18:33,023 --> 00:18:36,670
<i>...now find themselves in the number
two spot in the B.C.S. rankings...</i>

327
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:37,828
I'm closing my tabs.

328
00:18:37,872 --> 00:18:39,593
- Anything else?
- No, thanks.

329
00:18:40,054 --> 00:18:41,054
Tough shift, huh?

330
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:43,490
Just be glad
your day's not as bad as mine.

331
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:47,438
<i>...notre Dame, the only team
in the preseason top five</i>

332
00:18:47,488 --> 00:18:49,438
<i>still holding that distinction.</i>

333
00:19:12,245 --> 00:19:16,181
<i>...in baseball, the Dodgers
have once again defied expectation,</i>

334
00:19:16,225 --> 00:19:17,823
<i>by coming back from the dead</i>

335
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,213
<i>with a 7-run rally
in the bottom of the 9th</i>

336
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:22,607
<i>to beat the Giants 11-10.</i>

337
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,223
I knew it. I told you this would happen.

338
00:19:25,358 --> 00:19:28,319
But nobody believed me.
Didn't I say this would happen?

339
00:19:28,459 --> 00:19:30,495
I shoulda put money on that bitch.

340
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,267
Hey, man, uh...

341
00:19:36,822 --> 00:19:38,155
How did you know they'd win?

342
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,955
Because the Dodgers rule!

343
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,468
<i>...the Mets should probably clinch
the division for next season.</i>

344
00:19:47,498 --> 00:19:49,494
Right. Yeah. Go, blue.

345
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:50,791
Go, blue.

346
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:53,528
Yes, this is detective Spivak.

347
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:55,165
I'm looking into an old case.

348
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,134
The D.R. Number is 91

349
00:19:59,357 --> 00:20:00,781
4641.

350
00:20:01,176 --> 00:20:03,425
Okay. Well, could you
transfer me then, please?

351
00:20:03,426 --> 00:20:05,934
So someone checked out
the murder book. I need to know who.

352
00:20:07,098 --> 00:20:08,108
What did you say?

353
00:20:08,138 --> 00:20:11,431
Internal Affairs pulled a murder book.

354
00:20:11,532 --> 00:20:13,764
I need to know
the name of the requester.

355
00:20:13,804 --> 00:20:15,229
Well then, what time do they open?

356
00:20:15,236 --> 00:20:16,239
Hello?

357
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:17,885
Hello!

358
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,111
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's me.</i>

359
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:27,816
Thank god. Are you okay?

360
00:20:27,847 --> 00:20:29,513
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

361
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:31,096
<i>Brett, you know what they're saying.</i>

362
00:20:31,124 --> 00:20:34,632
They brought me in, they asked me
questions, told me terrible things.

363
00:20:34,682 --> 00:20:36,692
<i>I know. I'm sorry
they put you through all that.</i>

364
00:20:36,723 --> 00:20:37,975
You know none of it's true.

365
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:39,227
I didn't believe it.

366
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:42,773
éI love you.

367
00:20:43,732 --> 00:20:44,783
I love you, too.

368
00:20:44,904 --> 00:20:45,904
<i>Now...</i>

369
00:20:45,985 --> 00:20:47,530
<i>I have to ask you a favor.</i>

370
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:49,571
Honey, I need to speak to Chad.

371
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:52,479
<i>I don't have time to explain.
I know he's there.</i>

372
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:54,459
<i>That's fine. I just need to speak</i>

373
00:20:54,489 --> 00:20:56,491
to him, because it's very,
very important.

374
00:20:57,966 --> 00:21:00,430
It's for you. It's... Brett.

375
00:21:07,584 --> 00:21:10,635
- Heya, partner.
- Internal affairs pulled a murder book

376
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,938
for a case from 1991.

377
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,604
I need you to tell me who.

378
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:15,911
<i>Classic Hopper...</i>

379
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,608
Target of a citywide manhunt,

380
00:21:17,649 --> 00:21:20,214
but it's still "I need, I need, I need."

381
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:23,103
- I'm trying to prove my innocence here.
<i>- Great!</i>

382
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:25,719
Come on into the station,
we'll talk all about it.

383
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:27,053
Why don't you come get me?

384
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:28,555
I'm at the corner of...

385
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:38,514
Andrea, please tell me
that you did not see Eddie today.

386
00:21:38,878 --> 00:21:39,878
Hello?

387
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,201
<i>You turned her against me.</i>

388
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:44,613
- Eddie?
<i>- You did it, Hopper.</i>

389
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,798
<i>- Remember that.
- Eddie!</i>

390
00:21:47,586 --> 00:21:48,637
<i>What are you doing?</i>

391
00:21:48,677 --> 00:21:49,725
<i>Put it down!</i>

392
00:23:00,787 --> 00:23:02,297
I like when you wake me.

393
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:05,429
Now you're all dressed, and I've already
missed all the good parts.

394
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:09,166
That's a good part, too.

395
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:12,575
- You remember Eddie Reyes?
- Of course I do.

396
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:13,908
Are you still feeling bad

397
00:23:13,939 --> 00:23:16,454
- about how that went down?
- No... It's Andrea.

398
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,859
I feel like she may be
getting caught up in something with him.

399
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,111
Like what?

400
00:23:21,414 --> 00:23:22,485
I don't know.

401
00:23:22,661 --> 00:23:25,566
It might have to do
with the I.A. investigations, though.

402
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,470
Whatever it is, it's not gonna end well.

403
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:31,440
How could you possibly know that?

404
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,594
Because I've seen it happen before.

405
00:23:33,874 --> 00:23:35,733
Yeah, but the difference is you.

406
00:23:36,726 --> 00:23:40,066
You've seen this kind of thing happen
before, so why don't you help her?

407
00:23:40,207 --> 00:23:41,439
Don't let it happen.

408
00:23:42,318 --> 00:23:43,854
It might not be that simple.

409
00:23:45,035 --> 00:23:46,802
Well, then at least you tried.

410
00:23:52,975 --> 00:23:54,783
Be safe today... okay?

411
00:23:56,793 --> 00:23:57,823
You, too.

412
00:24:27,677 --> 00:24:30,596
<i>That thing on the dash...
I think it's a GPS or something.</i>

413
00:24:55,038 --> 00:24:57,421
- What are you doing here?
- I need to talk to you.

414
00:24:58,885 --> 00:25:01,117
I know this is coming out
of nowhere, but...

415
00:25:01,915 --> 00:25:03,966
You gotta stay away from Eddie today.

416
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:06,672
- What?
- Yeah, he's using again

417
00:25:06,814 --> 00:25:09,695
so if you see him
it'll end bad for the both of you.

418
00:25:12,788 --> 00:25:13,947
Where is he?

419
00:25:16,007 --> 00:25:18,241
- What he...
- Where is he?

420
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:20,906
Hey Hopper.

421
00:25:23,098 --> 00:25:26,350
You got a lot of cojones,
coming here saying that crap about me.

422
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:27,441
You lied to me.

423
00:25:27,603 --> 00:25:30,411
You've been all business
with me for the last six months.

424
00:25:30,976 --> 00:25:32,603
Now all of a sudden we're best friends,

425
00:25:32,623 --> 00:25:35,411
- confiding secrets in each other?
- I never hid anything from you.

426
00:25:35,431 --> 00:25:38,441
Like the fact you've been looking
into the latin disciples?

427
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,017
Thought I didn't know?

428
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,644
How is what we do together

429
00:25:42,674 --> 00:25:44,902
- any of your business?
- You stay out of this.

430
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:47,445
You lost the right
to tell me what to do

431
00:25:47,446 --> 00:25:49,463
when you asked for
a drug test that got me fired.

432
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:51,351
- It's not what happened.
- And I am to believe

433
00:25:51,352 --> 00:25:52,038
you didn't know?

434
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:54,350
- You weren't doing your job!
- That's right.

435
00:25:54,366 --> 00:25:56,540
You just had
to protect your reputation...

436
00:25:56,598 --> 00:25:59,893
And now you're gonna
screw Andrea the way you screwed me.

437
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:04,012
You're on your own.

438
00:26:31,142 --> 00:26:32,294
<i>This is Chad Shelton.</i>

439
00:26:32,404 --> 00:26:33,425
Chad, it's Hopper.

440
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:35,334
<i>Didn't expect to hear from you so early.</i>

441
00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:36,480
The meeting's at 3:00.

442
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:38,732
- I had a question for you.
<i>- I got some questions</i>

443
00:26:38,769 --> 00:26:41,113
for you too. I was gonna
wait to ask them in person.

444
00:26:41,163 --> 00:26:42,981
So, then, uh, we're still on?

445
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:44,337
<i>I'm sure we're both looking</i>

446
00:26:44,367 --> 00:26:46,486
forward to spending
this quality time together.

447
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:49,125
- So why are you calling me?
<i>- I'm looking into this...</i>

448
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:50,882
homicide from 1991.

449
00:26:50,987 --> 00:26:54,498
Now the records say that Internal
Affairs pulled the murder book

450
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:56,093
Do you have any idea who?

451
00:26:58,811 --> 00:27:00,698
I can't wait
to help you out with that, buddy.

452
00:27:00,718 --> 00:27:03,275
Can I get you anything else?
Maybe walk your dog

453
00:27:03,316 --> 00:27:04,739
<i>for you? Wash your car?</i>

454
00:27:05,538 --> 00:27:07,336
Maybe you wanna sleep with my ex-wife?

455
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:08,548
Oh, wait...

456
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:11,659
Punk...

457
00:27:13,295 --> 00:27:14,305
Tough day?

458
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,437
Yeah.

459
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:17,366
Things'll look up.

460
00:27:17,467 --> 00:27:20,194
- What can I bring you?
- Just... some coffee, please.

461
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:30,374
This is detective Spivak calling from
Homicide. I'm looking for records...

462
00:27:30,415 --> 00:27:31,423
Yes, I will hold.

463
00:27:31,425 --> 00:27:33,122
Well, I know Internal Affairs has it.

464
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,237
I'm trying to find who.

465
00:27:34,238 --> 00:27:35,550
Can I speak to your Lieutenant?

466
00:27:35,597 --> 00:27:37,183
I need to talk to your Captain.

467
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:39,132
<i>This is the Los Angeles
Police Department.</i>

468
00:27:39,174 --> 00:27:40,611
<i>Your call is important to us.</i>

469
00:27:40,612 --> 00:27:43,203
<i>Your estimated wait time is 15 minutes.</i>

470
00:27:43,274 --> 00:27:46,658
Let me ask you something, woman.
This look like white wine to you?

471
00:27:47,507 --> 00:27:50,091
Oh no, I know you didn't just do that!

472
00:27:50,734 --> 00:27:52,673
Now bring me what I ordered.

473
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:02,304
- Yeah?
<i>- Detective Hopper,</i>

474
00:28:02,648 --> 00:28:04,930
<i>I understand
you've been making some calls.</i>

475
00:28:05,092 --> 00:28:07,811
- Who is this?
<i>- It's not going to be that easy.</i>

476
00:28:11,234 --> 00:28:14,123
<i>You're going to admit
to killing alberto Garza.</i>

477
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:18,810
Well, you're calling me...

478
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:21,709
whoever you are,
so you must want something.

479
00:28:21,989 --> 00:28:23,446
<i>I'll get right to the point.</i>

480
00:28:23,486 --> 00:28:25,726
<i>You do have something I'm looking for.</i>

481
00:28:27,012 --> 00:28:28,244
The packages...

482
00:28:28,577 --> 00:28:30,325
<i>Very good, detective Hopper.</i>

483
00:28:30,677 --> 00:28:33,559
Okay, you want the packages.
I want some answers.

484
00:28:34,103 --> 00:28:36,457
<i>You bring what you have to Elysian Park.</i>

485
00:28:37,053 --> 00:28:38,608
<i>There are some picnic tables.</i>

486
00:28:38,803 --> 00:28:41,097
<i>The one on the north end at 2:00 P.M.</i>

487
00:28:41,335 --> 00:28:43,638
<i>and I'll bring you
all the answers you need.</i>

488
00:28:43,677 --> 00:28:44,814
Okay. If I get there,

489
00:28:44,999 --> 00:28:46,652
and it looks like a trap, I'm gone.

490
00:28:46,889 --> 00:28:48,176
<i>Detective Hopper,</i>

491
00:28:48,788 --> 00:28:50,891
<i>you act as though you have a choice.</i>

492
00:29:22,503 --> 00:29:23,839
Andrea, I cannot do this now,

493
00:29:23,926 --> 00:29:25,776
okay? I tried to help you
early this morning.

494
00:29:26,071 --> 00:29:27,126
You're on your own now.

495
00:29:27,216 --> 00:29:28,324
<i>Please, Hopper.</i>

496
00:29:29,608 --> 00:29:30,695
Andrea?

497
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:31,835
I need your help.

498
00:29:33,315 --> 00:29:34,323
It's Eddie.

499
00:29:35,189 --> 00:29:37,842
- I made a terrible mistake.
- What happened with Eddie?

500
00:29:38,114 --> 00:29:41,138
I can't go to the police
because of I.A, and Eddie...

501
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:44,572
Look, I need you right now.
And no one else can help me.

502
00:29:44,899 --> 00:29:46,031
<i>If we don't find him,</i>

503
00:29:46,709 --> 00:29:47,781
he's dead.

504
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,959
<i>Please, Hopper.</i>

505
00:29:54,066 --> 00:29:55,389
I can't do this alone.

506
00:30:00,662 --> 00:30:02,912
<i>You bring what you have
to Elysian park,</i>

507
00:30:03,146 --> 00:30:05,618
<i>and I will bring you
all the answers you need.</i>

508
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,410
You don't always get to choose
who you fall in love with though, right?

509
00:30:12,627 --> 00:30:16,289
I mean, I knew Eddie had been using,
but I thought that was behind us.

510
00:30:16,395 --> 00:30:17,476
I mean,

511
00:30:19,062 --> 00:30:21,303
I helped him get clean. He was better.

512
00:30:21,454 --> 00:30:23,542
I didn't think it was gonna
be like that again.

513
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,851
What happened?

514
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,815
You did...

515
00:30:28,045 --> 00:30:29,047
this morning.

516
00:30:30,627 --> 00:30:32,303
After you left, he got so mad.

517
00:30:33,722 --> 00:30:35,886
He started throwing things.
He ran off...

518
00:30:37,476 --> 00:30:40,181
and then he found me here
at the market later.

519
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:43,557
I've seen him like this before,

520
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,872
and I know he's gonna do
something stupid.

521
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:47,558
He had his old .38,

522
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:49,725
and I know he's gonna score.

523
00:30:50,254 --> 00:30:51,615
Where does he go to score?

524
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,461
Danny Yan.

525
00:30:54,263 --> 00:30:55,264
Slim?

526
00:30:56,587 --> 00:30:57,624
Your C.I?

527
00:30:58,413 --> 00:30:59,427
Yeah.

528
00:31:00,258 --> 00:31:02,203
What exactly is Eddie mixed up in?

529
00:31:17,819 --> 00:31:20,375
There's a lot more bounce
than bouncer for club like this.

530
00:31:20,539 --> 00:31:22,005
I know, something's wrong.

531
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:24,370
None of Slim's guys are on the floor.

532
00:31:27,246 --> 00:31:30,790
Get everyone out there.
He doesn't leave this neighborhood.

533
00:31:34,937 --> 00:31:35,938
Battle.

534
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,252
I should've known.

535
00:31:37,881 --> 00:31:40,351
- Where's Eddie?
- We had a little disagreement.

536
00:31:40,444 --> 00:31:41,452
What did you do?

537
00:31:42,954 --> 00:31:44,327
Tell me something, babe.

538
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,539
How does a pathetic tweaker like Eddie

539
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:49,085
score such a sweet slice
of pie like you?

540
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:51,681
Yeah, keep talking, Slim.
I will shoot your ass.

541
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:54,199
I'm a victim here.

542
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:57,603
I just got assaulted in my place
of business by your boyfriend,

543
00:31:57,746 --> 00:32:00,663
- which by the way, doubles your juice.
- Shut up.

544
00:32:04,617 --> 00:32:07,449
Hopper doesn't know
about our little arrangement, right?

545
00:32:08,382 --> 00:32:12,617
You want to arrest somebody detective,
try our star-crossed lovers here.

546
00:32:13,006 --> 00:32:15,565
One of them's got a nasty habit
he can't keep up with,

547
00:32:15,779 --> 00:32:19,477
and the other one, well... can you put
somebody away for being an enabler?

548
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:22,371
- Don't.
- See, when Eddie was on the job,

549
00:32:22,714 --> 00:32:24,706
he got used to taking home free samples,

550
00:32:24,949 --> 00:32:27,138
but ex-cops don't get glass for free,

551
00:32:27,696 --> 00:32:30,343
so Charlie's Angel here
kept bailing him out.

552
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,312
Straight out of Shakespeare, man.

553
00:32:33,569 --> 00:32:34,535
So sad...

554
00:32:35,658 --> 00:32:38,585
Did you wake up this morning and decide
you wanted a bullet in your head?

555
00:32:38,586 --> 00:32:41,822
Because the day I'm having, you do not
wanna get on my bad side.

556
00:32:41,951 --> 00:32:44,118
- All I'm saying...
- Where's Eddie?

557
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:48,791
Somewhere on foot between
the 110 and the Cornfields.

558
00:32:49,446 --> 00:32:50,812
Chinatown ain't that big, man.

559
00:32:50,855 --> 00:32:52,685
You better hope you find him
before we do.

560
00:32:52,728 --> 00:32:54,200
Yeah, you better hope we do, too.

561
00:33:02,521 --> 00:33:05,073
You were paying off that dirtbag?

562
00:33:05,757 --> 00:33:07,000
That's what I.A.'S got on you?

563
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,659
- It's not that simple.
- Yeah, it is.

564
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,760
You were giving money to a drug dealer.

565
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:12,343
They were gonna kill Eddie,

566
00:33:12,403 --> 00:33:14,577
okay? I couldn't report it.
I didn't have a choice.

567
00:33:14,642 --> 00:33:17,118
Do you have any idea
what I gave up to help you?

568
00:33:17,476 --> 00:33:20,240
My family, Rita...
their lives are in danger

569
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:21,844
because I'm being framed for murder,

570
00:33:21,967 --> 00:33:24,278
and today I had a chance
to find the guy behind it,

571
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,345
maybe even stop it, but I didn't.

572
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,127
I helped you instead.

573
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,859
- I'm sorry, Hopper.
- "Sorry"?

574
00:33:35,281 --> 00:33:38,834
"Sorry" doesn't keep me out of jail,
or Rita from getting killed.

575
00:33:38,970 --> 00:33:40,977
"Sorry" doesn't end is damn day.

576
00:33:42,215 --> 00:33:43,223
"Sorry"...

577
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:47,874
Every morning...

578
00:33:49,383 --> 00:33:50,686
I wake up and I think:

579
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:54,265
"maybe today'll be different",

580
00:33:55,531 --> 00:33:57,178
but it always ends the same.

581
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:02,228
He's 30 days clean, and I'm back
in Slim's parking lot,

582
00:34:02,314 --> 00:34:04,286
hoping to God I find Eddie alive.

583
00:34:06,154 --> 00:34:09,683
But I can't give up,
because what if today it is different?

584
00:34:10,156 --> 00:34:11,529
Maybe today he kicks it,

585
00:34:12,523 --> 00:34:13,524
or he dies.

586
00:34:16,029 --> 00:34:17,219
If it were someone you loved,

587
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:20,514
wouldn't you do everything
that you could to save them?

588
00:34:32,408 --> 00:34:34,172
I know where Eddie's gonna be.

589
00:34:37,281 --> 00:34:39,544
- He's gonna show up near here.
- How do you know that?

590
00:34:39,595 --> 00:34:40,797
Trust me, just keep looking.

591
00:34:41,283 --> 00:34:43,248
- I take inside you take the street?
- Yeah.

592
00:34:55,946 --> 00:34:57,396
- Your keys.
- Put down the gun.

593
00:34:57,415 --> 00:34:58,277
Keys, now.

594
00:35:00,437 --> 00:35:01,517
Keys, now.

595
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:11,163
- Come on, baby, just...
- Eddie, don't do this.

596
00:35:12,722 --> 00:35:13,720
Don't do this.

597
00:35:16,718 --> 00:35:18,225
You never got it, did you, Hopper?

598
00:35:18,347 --> 00:35:20,497
You just... you didn't even try
to understand.

599
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:23,816
- Please, Eddie...
- I'm talking here, baby.

600
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:26,707
All right, what didn't I understand?

601
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,030
I got seven years on you,
and you still made d-2 before I did.

602
00:35:30,034 --> 00:35:32,343
You know, I mean,
not everybody's a super cop.

603
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:33,846
I just wanted a little relief.

604
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:35,799
- Okay?
- Okay, I get that.

605
00:35:36,056 --> 00:35:39,596
I get that. But your beef is with me,
not Andrea, so let her go, man.

606
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,881
- Just put down your gun.
- You know I can't do that.

607
00:35:41,938 --> 00:35:44,842
Eddie, come on,
it doesn't have to go down like this.

608
00:35:46,822 --> 00:35:50,362
You know that cholo
that I caught up in Boyle Heights?

609
00:35:50,427 --> 00:35:51,853
You know, that low-level dealer?

610
00:35:51,925 --> 00:35:52,931
What?

611
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,020
I patted him down, I swear I did.

612
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:57,105
- Why don't you just listen?
- All right.

613
00:35:57,184 --> 00:35:58,335
In, booking,

614
00:35:59,186 --> 00:36:02,706
I find out that he's got a little 5-shot
just jammed in his belt,

615
00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:05,259
and he coulda popped us at any time,

616
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:09,336
and I didn't catch it
'cause I was tweaking.

617
00:36:11,165 --> 00:36:12,491
So I look at this guy,

618
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,648
and I ask him, you know :
"why didn't you shoot me?"

619
00:36:18,919 --> 00:36:20,552
And he just looks at me

620
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:23,556
and he said:
"because you seem like a nice guy."

621
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:27,107
I should be dead,
and you should be dead.

622
00:36:27,286 --> 00:36:29,803
We, all of us should be dead
because of me.

623
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,810
- It's over, man.
- No, it's not over.

624
00:36:32,892 --> 00:36:35,531
Eddie, listen, we can all
walk out of here together.

625
00:36:37,664 --> 00:36:39,024
I didn't make the call, Eddie.

626
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:40,214
You hear me?

627
00:36:41,126 --> 00:36:42,488
I didn't make the call.

628
00:36:43,317 --> 00:36:45,796
All right?
But I didn't warn you, either.

629
00:36:46,133 --> 00:36:50,603
Now I'd heard that the drug test was
coming down, and I knew you were using.

630
00:36:50,749 --> 00:36:53,710
But what's on me
is that I coulda helped you,

631
00:36:54,303 --> 00:36:55,383
and I didn't,

632
00:36:56,236 --> 00:36:57,308
and I'm asking...

633
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,157
all right?

634
00:36:59,729 --> 00:37:00,644
There.

635
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:03,054
I'm asking you now, please,

636
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:06,072
let me help you now.

637
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:07,862
Eddie?

638
00:37:09,421 --> 00:37:11,266
Let me help you.

639
00:37:13,443 --> 00:37:14,972
Let me help you this time.

640
00:37:20,582 --> 00:37:21,648
I got you.

641
00:37:22,702 --> 00:37:23,799
- Okay.
- Sorry.

642
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:25,839
All right.

643
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:31,438
I'm so sorry.

644
00:38:13,011 --> 00:38:15,123
- Morning.
- Hey, good morning.

645
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:18,684
- I didn't hear you get up.
- I didn't want to wake you.

646
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:20,168
I like when you wake me.

647
00:38:22,846 --> 00:38:24,019
Is everything okay?

648
00:38:24,948 --> 00:38:26,183
The phone is ringing.

649
00:38:27,387 --> 00:38:29,116
Yeah, that's what it does.

650
00:38:29,217 --> 00:38:30,504
This hasn't happened before.

651
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:33,261
What, someone calling you?
Are you kidding?

652
00:38:33,319 --> 00:38:34,399
No, it's not that.

653
00:38:35,697 --> 00:38:36,873
Something's changed.

654
00:38:37,381 --> 00:38:39,262
- Andrea.
- Hey, Hopper.

655
00:38:40,325 --> 00:38:41,390
So...

656
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:45,115
this might sound a little
out of the blue, but...

657
00:38:46,638 --> 00:38:48,808
I'm taking Eddie to rehab this morning.

658
00:38:48,944 --> 00:38:50,476
<i>There's a lot to tell you.</i>

659
00:38:53,635 --> 00:38:54,678
You still there?

660
00:38:57,495 --> 00:39:00,044
You didn't have to come, you know.
I can do this without you.

661
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:01,904
Wanted to see it myself.

662
00:39:02,004 --> 00:39:04,471
You know, you threw a lot at me
on the phone.

663
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:07,166
Sorry. It's just...

664
00:39:07,817 --> 00:39:09,512
when I woke up today, I felt...

665
00:39:11,011 --> 00:39:12,034
I felt different.

666
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:13,793
Different? Like... Like how?

667
00:39:13,886 --> 00:39:15,659
Like I had this weird urge to call you,

668
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:18,653
and then all this stuff came out, and...

669
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:22,677
it's strange. I've been feeling so...

670
00:39:23,442 --> 00:39:25,649
hopeless, but today, I don't know.

671
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,956
It's good? Yeah,

672
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,335
and even with this I.A. Stuff, I mean,

673
00:39:32,794 --> 00:39:35,726
I woke up with the strangest idea,
why don't I just tell Chad the truth?

674
00:39:35,812 --> 00:39:38,599
I'd like to think that, you know,
he wouldn't crucify you, but...

675
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,535
Yeah, well, I've already called
my league rep

676
00:39:40,536 --> 00:39:42,677
and told him
that's what I'm gonna do, so...

677
00:39:42,834 --> 00:39:44,844
If I get days, I get days.

678
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:48,186
And, if I lose my job,

679
00:39:49,844 --> 00:39:51,017
at least I'm not dead.

680
00:39:54,754 --> 00:39:57,052
What? Why does that make you laugh?

681
00:39:57,163 --> 00:40:00,577
No, it's this just isn't the day
that I expected to have.

682
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:02,843
Yeah, me neither...

683
00:40:04,431 --> 00:40:05,511
but here we are.

684
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:08,586
What about Eddie?

685
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:12,326
Well, I don't think he's happy
to be pushed out of the nest.

686
00:40:13,069 --> 00:40:15,307
I don't think it's gonna be easy
either way.

687
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:21,363
- What are you looking at?
- My old partner.

688
00:40:21,578 --> 00:40:24,611
Don't look so smug. I'll break
my foot off in your ass, <i>cabron</i>.

689
00:40:24,725 --> 00:40:27,727
So you got any gas
in this piece of crap, or what?

690
00:40:47,008 --> 00:40:48,953
What, is this some kind of joke?

691
00:40:50,351 --> 00:40:53,241
- What are you talking about?
- Like I'm supposed to see this,

692
00:40:53,348 --> 00:40:55,381
and it'll remind me of what kind of cop

693
00:40:55,438 --> 00:40:57,701
I used to be or some garbage like that?

694
00:40:58,374 --> 00:41:00,126
What's supposed to remind you of that?

695
00:41:00,190 --> 00:41:02,243
This stupid picture that you dug up.

696
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:03,880
- You knew about that picture?
- Yeah,

697
00:41:03,951 --> 00:41:05,849
I should.
I was the first officer on scene.

698
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,266
- What?
- Jane Doe.

699
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,865
Body dumped in a car off Figueroa.

700
00:41:09,902 --> 00:41:11,762
I was a rookie. I didn't know much.

701
00:41:12,164 --> 00:41:14,340
That's when I first met your old man.

702
00:41:15,036 --> 00:41:16,065
He was okay.

703
00:41:16,712 --> 00:41:19,412
- My father was there?
- Yeah, he was the lead detective on it.

704
00:41:19,413 --> 00:41:20,352
But he didn't close it.

705
00:41:20,353 --> 00:41:23,294
Evidence went missing
and it just all fell apart.

706
00:41:24,201 --> 00:41:27,734
It's funny how they always hinge
on some little, stupid thing.
