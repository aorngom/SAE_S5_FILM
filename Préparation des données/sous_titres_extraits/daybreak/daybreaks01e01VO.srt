2
00:00:39,733 --> 00:00:41,160
You need new pillows.

3
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,122
My pillows rule and you know it.

4
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:06,760
You know, we could stay
at your place tonight.

5
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,579
Maybe.

6
00:01:11,929 --> 00:01:13,554
We'll see how the day goes.

7
00:01:17,755 --> 00:01:20,445
<i>...we've got a sigalert
on the northbound 405 at the 10</i>

8
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:22,120
<i>to an overturned semi.</i>

9
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:24,705
<i>It spilled over a hundred cases
of diapers</i>

10
00:01:24,897 --> 00:01:26,408
<i>all across the lanes of traffic.</i>

11
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:31,755
Somebody's tense.

12
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,050
Keep going. I'll get over it.

13
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:38,960
You've been working too hard.

14
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:44,280
This coming from a girl who works
four double shifts in five days?

15
00:01:44,686 --> 00:01:46,236
Life of a nurse.

16
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,565
Life of a cop.

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,514
Let's just take a drive up the coast.
Blow off the world for a day.

18
00:01:58,842 --> 00:02:01,611
I got a meeting
with Internal Affairs at 3:00.

19
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,185
- This is about Andrea?
- Yeah.

20
00:02:04,697 --> 00:02:06,190
How serious is it?

21
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:07,604
Serious enough.

22
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:11,125
I'd hate to lose
another partner just 'cause

23
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:13,831
somebody's got a personal axe to grind.

24
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:18,390
You think Chad
has something to do with it?

25
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,510
I got it.

26
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,476
Listen... your business
is your business,

27
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:52,152
and me bringing up my ex-husband
in the shower just...

28
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:55,768
...that wasn't right,
so I'll never do it again.

29
00:02:57,098 --> 00:02:59,861
I didn't mean to break
your palm tree thing.

30
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,800
My mom gave it to me.

31
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,820
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:06,352
Where can I get you a new one?

33
00:03:06,465 --> 00:03:08,706
This cute little place in Palm Springs.

34
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,097
I think it's called a gas station.

35
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:18,430
Listen...

36
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:24,305
- I know things haven't been exactly...
- No, everything's all good, all right?

37
00:03:24,427 --> 00:03:25,890
I'll call you at the hospital?

38
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,669
- All right.
- Be safe.

39
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,617
Give Rambis a hug for me.

40
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,133
Okay.

41
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:54,790
I've got a dozen e-mails to return,
a conference call that starts like now.

42
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:56,598
And the note says...

43
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,334
What?

44
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:01,087
You want me in Burbank by 8:00?

45
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:04,500
That's in 20 minutes. I'm in Venice.

46
00:04:08,268 --> 00:04:09,298
Crap.

47
00:04:15,621 --> 00:04:17,530
It's okay, ma'am. I'm a cop.

48
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,961
Thank you, officer.

49
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,687
Excuse me, ma'am!

50
00:04:26,883 --> 00:04:27,951
Miss!

51
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:32,465
- I don't know some diapers or some...
- Excuse me, miss. You dropped this.

52
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,957
Somebody call 9-1-1!

53
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:47,040
Oh my God!

54
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,258
Are you okay?

55
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,694
My car!

56
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:51,574
My car!

57
00:05:06,788 --> 00:05:11,069
Mr. Hopper, your dog
bark very hard last night.

58
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,550
Oh, sorry about that, Mr. Zeitoun.

59
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,445
You have a leak from upstairs.

60
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:20,515
My wife say plumbers come.

61
00:05:20,629 --> 00:05:21,973
- Now we have leak.
- Okay.

62
00:05:22,049 --> 00:05:23,970
- Thank you.
- You have leak. We have leak.

63
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:36,983
Rambis?

64
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,183
Rambis.

65
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:02,492
Rambis. Psycho dog,
did you make this mess?

66
00:06:11,365 --> 00:06:14,000
All right, all right, I get it.
Give me this.

67
00:06:16,072 --> 00:06:17,620
<i>You have nine messages.</i>

68
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,868
<i>Message one.</i>

69
00:06:20,877 --> 00:06:22,049
<i>Message two.</i>

70
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,697
Hello.

71
00:06:30,876 --> 00:06:33,414
Sis, I got six hang ups from you
last night. What's goin' on?

72
00:06:33,922 --> 00:06:36,080
Nothing. We just... We just had a little

73
00:06:36,256 --> 00:06:38,730
problem with the phone.
But it's okay now.

74
00:06:38,968 --> 00:06:40,460
<i>You sure?</i>
You sound kinda rattled?

75
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:43,710
<i>It's... we're just late for school.</i>

76
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:46,046
So we'll talk later, okay? Bye.

77
00:06:54,687 --> 00:06:56,380
<i>Message seven.</i>

78
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,731
<i>Damn it, where you at?
It's me, Damien.</i>

79
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:02,540
<i>Turn on your cell phone.
They hit the safe house, Hop.</i>

80
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:04,500
<i>You need to come get my ass.</i>

81
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,620
Police! Hands up!

82
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,387
Easy! I'm a cop. I'm a cop!

83
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,300
Okay, okay, I'm relaxed.

84
00:07:13,825 --> 00:07:16,810
- Detective Brett Hopper?
- Yeah. Get these guys off of me.

85
00:07:16,877 --> 00:07:19,058
You're under arrest
for the murder of assistant D.A.

86
00:07:19,097 --> 00:07:19,924
Alberto Garza.

87
00:07:19,971 --> 00:07:22,190
- What?
- You have the right to remain silent.

88
00:07:22,304 --> 00:07:24,870
If you give up the right
to remain silent, anything you say...

89
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,030
- Have a seat.
- Before you all apologize

90
00:07:40,124 --> 00:07:41,551
for breaking down my door,

91
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:43,064
I want to see the warrant.

92
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:46,055
'Cause you had to have more
than some lame-ass anonymous tip

93
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:48,859
to get a judge to sign off
on that kind of a blitz.

94
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,849
Well, they told us you'd puff up.

95
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,371
I'm detective Choi.

96
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:53,989
Detective Spivak.

97
00:07:54,075 --> 00:07:55,195
I've had the pleasure.

98
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:59,078
Look, you know what we do in here,
all the tactics, the back and forth,

99
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:00,954
so I'm coming straight at you.

100
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,357
What did you have against Garza?

101
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,750
You gotta be kidding, right?

102
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:11,020
We've got the murder weapon
with your prints on it.

103
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,493
All right, well,
a gun's easy enough to plant.

104
00:08:15,682 --> 00:08:18,203
Prints are doable, too,
a little tougher. Where'd you get it?

105
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:19,710
Where do you think we got it?

106
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:23,086
I don't know, but chances are,
whoever gave you the gun is in on it.

107
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:25,350
- Now tell me where you got it.
- Your place.

108
00:08:25,483 --> 00:08:26,532
Your closet.

109
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,928
The closet?

110
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,530
Pretty stupid move, man.

111
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,232
Why would you hang on
to something like that?

112
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:37,985
Somebody broke into my place
and put that gun there.

113
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,251
Now the neighbor said something
about a plumber,

114
00:08:40,336 --> 00:08:43,209
- and my dog was going crazy, so...
- Why'd you do it, Hopper?

115
00:08:43,276 --> 00:08:45,883
Was it personal, or did Garza
have something on you?

116
00:08:46,035 --> 00:08:47,570
All right, you guys aren't.

117
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,130
According to the newspapers, Garza
was hit sometime last night, right?

118
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:54,668
I was with somebody last night.

119
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:55,906
Rita Shelton.

120
00:08:55,981 --> 00:08:57,495
She's a nurse at Westside.

121
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:58,760
So I got an alibi.

122
00:08:58,921 --> 00:09:02,304
Secondly, I've never even met Garza,
so you got no motive.

123
00:09:02,398 --> 00:09:03,890
How about murder-for-hire?

124
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,072
I want my lawyer and a phone.

125
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:15,098
After you're booked, like everyone else.

126
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,820
Look into the camera, please.

127
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:23,780
Thank you very much. You can step away.

128
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:30,331
Hang on. That's my partner.

129
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,480
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

130
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,990
Your guess is as good as mine.

131
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:38,220
I've got to get to my brother!

132
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:42,235
They put me on leave.

133
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,516
So before you go telling

134
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,808
- certain people things you think...
- Andrea, hello?

135
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,580
Fingerprints, mug shot...
I'm a little busy right now.

136
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,180
Let's go, detective.

137
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,260
You are a lucky man, Hopper.

138
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:57,231
I got you one of the best defense
attorneys in the state: Barry Colburn.

139
00:09:57,262 --> 00:09:59,048
<i>He'll meet you at the court
for arraignment.</i>

140
00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:00,966
Come on, Baxter.
You gotta do better than that.

141
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:03,087
Now flex some federal muscle
<i>and get me outta here.</i>

142
00:10:03,134 --> 00:10:04,716
Doing my best. I've called all morning.

143
00:10:04,763 --> 00:10:07,162
Nobody's giving an inch,
not the D.A.'S office, not L.A.P.D.

144
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,834
I'm a cop with a clean record
and an alibi.

145
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,081
- How is this happening?
<i>- I know you're pissed.</i>

146
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:13,943
But this hurts me, too.
Damien is on the run,

147
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,942
and you're the only one he trusts.
This case hinges on his testimony.

148
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,952
<i>Well, I'm</i> sorry
for being so insensitive.

149
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,590
Seriously, how am I supposed to find
my star witness without you?

150
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:25,190
Did you see Damien last night?
<i>Did you talk to him? Give me something.</i>

151
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,240
He left a message on my machine.
He wants me <i>to come get him.</i>

152
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,293
Where is he?
What happened at the safe house?

153
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:34,854
Focus, Baxter. I'm the one in jail.

154
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:38,240
Now I can't help you or Damien
unless you get me outta here.

155
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:48,560
Let's go.

156
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,470
Hopper, why did you kill Garza?

157
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,819
Baxter tried to put in a good word
for you with the L.A. County D.A

158
00:11:06,951 --> 00:11:08,301
but Garza was one of theirs.

159
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,071
- Right, Colburn...
- Barry.

160
00:11:10,609 --> 00:11:11,630
Where's Rita?

161
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,238
We can't find her.

162
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,879
What do you mean?
Did you check the hospital?

163
00:11:16,946 --> 00:11:19,112
She's not at the hospital,
she's not in her apartment,

164
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:20,760
she's not answering her cell.

165
00:11:20,827 --> 00:11:23,302
The cops and my people
are looking for her.

166
00:11:23,359 --> 00:11:27,004
Colburn, your first
and last priority as of right now

167
00:11:27,108 --> 00:11:30,280
is to find Rita Shelton.
Do you understand me?

168
00:11:31,471 --> 00:11:32,472
Okay.

169
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:36,652
By the way,

170
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:40,030
pulled in a couple of favors
and got you some time with your sister.

171
00:11:40,596 --> 00:11:41,862
Jen, where is she?

172
00:11:42,826 --> 00:11:44,546
I'll see you in there, Hopper.

173
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,040
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm gonna be fine. I'm fine.

174
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:50,463
They said they found a gun.

175
00:11:50,548 --> 00:11:52,812
No. Well, they did.
Someone else put it there.

176
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,248
- Who would put...
- I don't know.

177
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,248
It doesn't matter
because I have an alibi.

178
00:11:56,872 --> 00:11:57,893
Rita Shelton.

179
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:01,289
Wait, you and Rita, as in Chad's wife?

180
00:12:01,412 --> 00:12:02,914
Well, ex-wife, but...

181
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,213
And you didn't tell me.

182
00:12:06,354 --> 00:12:08,870
Jen, we haven't been talking
as much as we... never mind that!

183
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,006
I wanna know about those 6 hang ups
from last night.

184
00:12:11,044 --> 00:12:13,090
And don't give me that mess
about the phones.

185
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:14,080
It's nothing, really.

186
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:15,917
Is everything okay
between you and Randall?

187
00:12:15,936 --> 00:12:17,374
- Of course.
- Jen, I...

188
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,240
I'm gonna kill him.

189
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:36,009
Who you killing now?

190
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:38,026
Chad.

191
00:12:38,772 --> 00:12:39,868
Jennifer.

192
00:12:40,378 --> 00:12:41,465
You're lookin' well.

193
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,470
Come on, partner.

194
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,340
Time to face the music.

195
00:12:47,656 --> 00:12:49,795
Boy, you know,
cops will pull a lot of crazy stunts

196
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:52,013
to weasel out of a meeting
with Internal Affairs.

197
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:55,457
But committing a murder, that definitely
wins a prize, right, Hopper?

198
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:58,158
You have an ugly smile.
People say that about you,

199
00:12:58,332 --> 00:12:59,834
especially women.

200
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,659
We'll meet you up on four, guys.

201
00:13:03,881 --> 00:13:06,740
I need a little quality time
with my old partner here.

202
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,724
I said we'll you up on four.

203
00:13:11,443 --> 00:13:12,454
Come on.

204
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:22,550
You get the score of the Dodgers game?

205
00:13:26,768 --> 00:13:28,932
I know Andrea is a dirty cop.
You'll help me prove it.

206
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:31,451
Yeah, I got a few other things
on my mind right now besides

207
00:13:31,491 --> 00:13:33,988
what my partner may or may not be into.

208
00:13:34,017 --> 00:13:36,453
Yeah, this whole
murdering-the-assistant-D.A thing,

209
00:13:36,484 --> 00:13:37,636
it's a real shame, isn't it?

210
00:13:37,656 --> 00:13:40,021
You know this thing screams setup
from like a mile away.

211
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,200
Setup? No, they got you cold, man.

212
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:43,751
Weapon, prints...

213
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:46,590
But you got an alibi, right? Rita...

214
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:50,125
Been spending a lot of time
with her lately.

215
00:13:50,792 --> 00:13:54,007
When you gonna make an honest woman
of her, get married already?

216
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:57,550
Tell the truth. It bugs you
she kept my last name, doesn't it?

217
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:00,590
You need a breath mint.

218
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,820
Here's what I don't understand...

219
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,090
You don't want to break
some unspoken code

220
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:08,179
by telling on your partner,

221
00:14:08,198 --> 00:14:10,448
yet you got no problem sleeping
with another man's wife?

222
00:14:10,478 --> 00:14:13,016
You were divorced,
and we weren't partners anymore.

223
00:14:13,046 --> 00:14:15,370
You expect me to believe
those years we rolled togeth...

224
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:18,206
It never happened, Chad... Never.

225
00:14:23,891 --> 00:14:26,720
How is she these days, my little Rita?

226
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,391
It's been a while, but there's

227
00:14:29,432 --> 00:14:32,616
certain things you just never forget.
You know, like in the shower...

228
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,650
You better watch it, convict.

229
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,610
You play this right, I can help you.

230
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,330
But you screw with me...

231
00:14:52,328 --> 00:14:53,440
Shelton!

232
00:14:56,776 --> 00:14:59,690
Why do I get the feeling
you know more than you're telling?

233
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,196
'Cause I do.

234
00:15:04,189 --> 00:15:06,777
And due to the severity of the crime
and the physical evidences

235
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:09,824
against the suspect,
the county requests no bail. We ask...

236
00:15:09,854 --> 00:15:11,543
Your Honor,
the district attorney's office

237
00:15:11,593 --> 00:15:14,267
has been made aware
of an exculpatory witness

238
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:17,017
- who can attest to my client's...
- A witness that we can't locate

239
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:18,022
at this time, Your Honor.

240
00:15:18,053 --> 00:15:20,397
We consider the suspect
to be a danger and a flight risk.

241
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:21,673
- Can we ask...
- Flight risk?

242
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:24,330
He's a decorated 12-year veteran
of the department.

243
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:28,005
Veteran or not, the People are pursuing
a charge of first-degree murder.

244
00:15:28,157 --> 00:15:30,439
Very well. People's request is granted.

245
00:15:30,621 --> 00:15:33,644
Suspect will be held without bail
and remanded to county jail.

246
00:15:33,805 --> 00:15:35,767
Preliminary hearing is set
for a week from today

247
00:15:35,807 --> 00:15:37,910
whether or not this witness
has been produced.

248
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:39,629
Dismissed.

249
00:15:41,034 --> 00:15:42,590
Find Rita.

250
00:16:41,976 --> 00:16:43,088
What is this?

251
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,020
Where am I?

252
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:49,327
Chad, is that you?

253
00:16:50,095 --> 00:16:53,140
Is this how Internal Affairs
is running things now?

254
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,091
Now that's enough questions,
detective Hopper.

255
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,600
You're going to admit
to killing Alberto Garza.

256
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:05,332
What?

257
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,241
Garza,

258
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:09,870
the assistant D.A.
You're going to confess.

259
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,382
I'm not gonna do a damn thing.

260
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,892
Who the hell are you people?

261
00:17:15,218 --> 00:17:16,696
You know, you really need

262
00:17:16,697 --> 00:17:18,928
to get over this tough guy persona.

263
00:17:18,999 --> 00:17:20,987
It's not going to help you here.

264
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:22,867
Show him.

265
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,800
You know firsthand
how dangerous this city can be.

266
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,835
Anything can happen to anyone.

267
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:43,785
Rita...

268
00:17:43,836 --> 00:17:47,213
Random acts of assault
and battery, rape.

269
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,119
Carjacking.

270
00:18:04,451 --> 00:18:06,300
I'm gonna kill you!

271
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,650
I'm gonna kill you!

272
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,860
- I will kill you!
- Calm down.

273
00:18:11,406 --> 00:18:12,703
There's more.

274
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:26,541
Don't worry.
Your sister and the kids are okay.

275
00:18:30,663 --> 00:18:34,060
I swear to God, I will find you.

276
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:38,530
Well, whatever you do
is your choice, detective,

277
00:18:39,347 --> 00:18:42,147
but just remember, for every decision,

278
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:44,755
- I'm gonna kill you.
- there's a consequence.

279
00:18:46,313 --> 00:18:47,384
Relax.

280
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,679
Just a mild sedative.

281
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:52,300
We'd like you to...

282
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:53,412
unwind.

283
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,196
Sleep on it.

284
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,704
Remember...

285
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,646
Decision,

286
00:19:03,646 --> 00:19:04,971
consequence.

287
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:09,217
Decision.

288
00:19:10,268 --> 00:19:11,694
consequence.

289
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:02,129
What was that for?

290
00:20:02,806 --> 00:20:04,697
I had the worst nightmare.

291
00:20:05,809 --> 00:20:07,052
It was so real.

292
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,812
Are you okay?

293
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:13,289
Yeah. Yeah. I just.

294
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:14,940
I feel a little sore.

295
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:40,410
Brett, what's wrong?

296
00:20:40,605 --> 00:20:42,610
You ever have a déjà-vu?

297
00:20:43,072 --> 00:20:45,780
Yeah. Gives me the creeps
when that happens.

298
00:20:50,795 --> 00:20:53,192
<i>...we've got a sigalert
on the northbound 405</i>

299
00:20:53,193 --> 00:20:55,216
<i>at the 10 due to an overturned semi.</i>

300
00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:58,110
<i>- It spilled over a hundred cases of...</i>
- Diapers.

301
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,510
<i>all across the lanes of traffic.
It's quite a sight to see.</i>

302
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:02,020
Brett?

303
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,220
Baby, you don't...
You don't look so good.

304
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,330
I need a shower.

305
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,990
Slow down. What happened?

306
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,750
Oh, my side.

307
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:21,200
Did I shave last night?

308
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:23,720
What? No. Why?

309
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:30,600
- What happened?
- I gotta go walk Rambis.

310
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:05,100
You gotta be kidding me.

311
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,250
<i>You have nine messages.</i>

312
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,670
<i>Message seven.</i>

313
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,760
<i>Damn it, where you at?
It's me, Damien.</i>

314
00:22:13,059 --> 00:22:14,205
<i>Turn on your cell...</i>

315
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:17,450
Yes, Rita Shelton.

316
00:22:17,632 --> 00:22:19,240
When she gets in, tell her not to go...

317
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:21,692
Jen, stay at home with the kids,
today. Don't go to school.

318
00:22:22,642 --> 00:22:23,640
- Yes.
<i>- Your place...</i>

319
00:22:23,678 --> 00:22:25,720
I need a patrol car
right outside her apartment.

320
00:22:25,839 --> 00:22:26,994
<i>In your closet.</i>

321
00:22:29,914 --> 00:22:31,289
It's a pretty stupid move, man.

322
00:22:31,319 --> 00:22:32,842
Murder weapon with your prints on it.

323
00:22:32,861 --> 00:22:34,890
Why would you hang on
to something like that?

324
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,607
My name?

325
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:39,470
Detective Spivak.

326
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,146
<i>He just dropped it in the water.</i>

327
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,040
Rita Shelton, where is she?

328
00:23:07,123 --> 00:23:09,478
- I'm sorry sir, you need to wait.
- I'm detective Hopper.

329
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:11,450
I called earlier. I need to see her now!

330
00:23:11,591 --> 00:23:13,020
She's not here now.

331
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,039
She's not here?
But her shift started at 8:00.

332
00:23:15,116 --> 00:23:17,292
She called in and said
she was taking a vacation day.

333
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,660
A vacation day?
She never said anything to me about...

334
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,050
Out of the way !

335
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:24,887
Massive trauma to her head,
internal bleeding, multiple fractures.

336
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:26,595
- What happened?
- Bus crash.

337
00:23:26,808 --> 00:23:28,990
Driver had a stroke,
went out of control.

338
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:31,417
Miss!

339
00:23:31,670 --> 00:23:33,470
You dropped this.

340
00:23:39,424 --> 00:23:40,430
Crash cart ready!

341
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:42,260
Move her into bay three!

342
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,070
I didn't go for coffee.

343
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,145
This is not a request!

344
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:02,540
You will sit in my office
until you learn to...

345
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:03,956
Brett?

346
00:24:06,186 --> 00:24:08,020
What are you doing here?

347
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:11,500
Randall... I'm gonna kill him.

348
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,420
You're dismissed.

349
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:23,800
Don't you ever touch my sister again.

350
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,775
From the assignment last night,

351
00:24:26,815 --> 00:24:30,114
who can tell me what country
Jules Verne was referring to?

352
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,000
Brett, what are you doing here?

353
00:24:36,196 --> 00:24:37,386
<i>Security : first floor west.</i>

354
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:40,180
I can't find Rita. She's missing,
so they're probably watching you.

355
00:24:40,199 --> 00:24:41,612
Rita? Rita who?

356
00:24:43,593 --> 00:24:45,362
Never mind.

357
00:24:45,514 --> 00:24:46,390
You're in danger.

358
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,760
I need you to get the kids,
get in a car and just drive.

359
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,820
Don't tell me where to.

360
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:51,292
Don't tell Randall. But go now.

361
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:53,506
What is wrong with you?
You're acting really crazy.

362
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,610
There isn't any time!

363
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,725
- What is it, Brett?
- Just do what I say

364
00:24:56,782 --> 00:24:57,910
and go far away from here.

365
00:24:58,245 --> 00:24:59,499
What did you do?

366
00:25:02,229 --> 00:25:04,170
- Just go.
- Go get the kids !

367
00:25:18,415 --> 00:25:20,022
What if I pull the wrong block?

368
00:25:20,123 --> 00:25:22,240
Then we start the game over, alright?

369
00:25:24,795 --> 00:25:25,796
Hopper?

370
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,292
Andrea.

371
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:28,620
Thanks for coming.

372
00:25:34,031 --> 00:25:36,940
Didn't think you'd call
considering the circumstances.

373
00:25:36,983 --> 00:25:39,192
Well, believe me,
I didn't have anywhere else to turn.

374
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,204
Good to know you think so highly of me.

375
00:25:43,295 --> 00:25:44,781
I didn't mean it like that.

376
00:25:44,862 --> 00:25:47,885
Listen, I need you to do me a favor
in case I get caught again.

377
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:50,552
Again? What do you mean?

378
00:25:51,048 --> 00:25:52,635
Nevermind. I need your help.

379
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:56,063
I can't find Rita, and I think
that she may be in danger.

380
00:25:56,477 --> 00:25:57,590
Now look, I know that...

381
00:25:57,756 --> 00:25:59,879
you got your own troubles
to deal with right now but

382
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:03,202
- I didn't say anything to I.A. about...
- Let's just stick to your problem, ok?

383
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,945
Tell me what happened with Garza.

384
00:26:09,096 --> 00:26:11,411
Garza? Why would you ask me...

385
00:26:37,048 --> 00:26:38,250
I'm sorry.

386
00:27:14,727 --> 00:27:16,750
Move! Get out of my way!

387
00:27:17,022 --> 00:27:18,043
Move!

388
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:43,503
<i>Doors opening.</i>

389
00:27:44,554 --> 00:27:45,990
<i>Doors opening.</i>

390
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,070
Move! Move!

391
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:01,758
<i>I've got him.</i>

392
00:28:04,215 --> 00:28:05,460
<i>He's boarding !</i>

393
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:10,028
We got him.
Suspect's on the westbound train.

394
00:28:10,107 --> 00:28:11,164
Cover all exits.

395
00:28:19,601 --> 00:28:21,160
<i>Doors closing.</i>

396
00:29:05,385 --> 00:29:06,676
Great minds, huh?

397
00:29:09,757 --> 00:29:12,222
We could tattoo the word "guilty"
right across your forehead.

398
00:29:12,242 --> 00:29:13,260
I know I'm clean.

399
00:29:13,644 --> 00:29:15,100
Youall ain't got nothing.

400
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:16,976
How about the murder weapon?

401
00:29:17,439 --> 00:29:18,943
I don't know what you talking about.

402
00:29:19,153 --> 00:29:20,038
Really?

403
00:29:20,367 --> 00:29:21,420
So you say the dive teams

404
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,262
won't find anything
off the Santa Monica pier?

405
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:27,959
In the water.

406
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:30,905
I think we hit a nerve.

407
00:29:31,169 --> 00:29:32,610
Who's feeding you this crap?

408
00:29:33,089 --> 00:29:34,014
Who's your source?

409
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,340
You're not asking the questions,
Hopper. We are.

410
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:38,401
Now why did you kill Garza?

411
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,147
You wanted the phone.

412
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,151
<i>Message seven.</i>

413
00:29:59,228 --> 00:30:00,260
<i>Damn it, where you at?</i>

414
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,330
<i>It's me, Damien.</i>

415
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:02,730
<i>Turn on your cell phone!</i>

416
00:30:03,372 --> 00:30:04,830
<i>They hit the safe house, Hop.</i>

417
00:30:04,952 --> 00:30:06,470
<i>You need to come get my ass!</i>

418
00:30:06,946 --> 00:30:09,200
<i>I'll be laying low where you first
got it all started.</i>

419
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:10,261
<i>You know what I'm saying?<i>

420
00:30:10,646 --> 00:30:12,303
<i>Meet me there at 9:00 tomorrow night.</i>

421
00:30:12,553 --> 00:30:13,740
That's tonight!

422
00:30:14,402 --> 00:30:15,365
<i>Message eight.</i>

423
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,728
All right, time's up.

424
00:30:16,767 --> 00:30:19,059
<i>Hopper, you should have received
a package today.</i>

425
00:30:19,194 --> 00:30:20,253
Let's go.

426
00:30:23,065 --> 00:30:24,702
Bad enough you're in here for murder.

427
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:27,295
You had to kick the crap
out of your brother-in-law, too?

428
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,322
It felt necessary...

429
00:30:28,461 --> 00:30:29,251
and good.

430
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,311
Well, that's great.

431
00:30:31,062 --> 00:30:32,988
Anyway, I spoke to your sister,

432
00:30:33,302 --> 00:30:35,330
and she's trying to get him
to drop the charges

433
00:30:35,410 --> 00:30:38,122
- but he's pretty pissed off.
- Wait, she's still with him?

434
00:30:38,449 --> 00:30:40,180
Yeah, at the hospital.

435
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,730
They're still picking the glass
out of his back.

436
00:30:43,151 --> 00:30:45,058
Okay, listen, Colburn.. Barry...

437
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:47,827
I need you to do me a favor
and get my sister and her kids

438
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:48,999
someplace safe.

439
00:30:49,654 --> 00:30:50,419
Why?

440
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:52,307
Please don't ask me questions.
Just do it.

441
00:30:52,386 --> 00:30:54,129
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

442
00:30:54,331 --> 00:30:55,707
I'll get out of here soon enough.

443
00:30:55,739 --> 00:30:57,357
Yeah, that's what they all say.

444
00:31:00,007 --> 00:31:03,080
Stinking Dodgers!
Down six runs going into the ninth.

445
00:31:03,351 --> 00:31:04,580
I had to turn it off.

446
00:31:04,882 --> 00:31:06,568
Meet you up on four, guys.

447
00:31:06,895 --> 00:31:09,574
I need a little quality time
with my old partner here.

448
00:31:10,248 --> 00:31:11,558
Don't worry, fellas.

449
00:31:11,866 --> 00:31:13,388
I'll be gentle.

450
00:31:23,031 --> 00:31:24,511
Wanna know a secret, Chad?

451
00:31:25,131 --> 00:31:27,039
The Dodgers rally in the ninth.

452
00:31:27,794 --> 00:31:28,830
They win.

453
00:31:32,272 --> 00:31:33,450
Where is Rita?

454
00:31:37,952 --> 00:31:40,350
You are itching for a toe tag,
aren't ya?

455
00:31:44,303 --> 00:31:45,613
Who is behind this?

456
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,210
Who's watching? Where's Rita?

457
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:49,470
You are certifiable.

458
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,497
I'll make sure you end up on death row.

459
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:58,003
You believe in second chances, Andrea?

460
00:33:04,994 --> 00:33:07,540
You cut a deal with I.A.
to bring me in, yes or no?

461
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,280
I'm not proud of it, okay.

462
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:12,141
But I.A. is convinced
I'm taking a payoff from some...

463
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,390
- Are you?
- No!

464
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,891
You shouldn't keep it
under your mattress.

465
00:33:27,948 --> 00:33:29,300
I found it in 30 seconds.

466
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:31,340
What are you doing in my home, Hopper?

467
00:33:32,181 --> 00:33:34,120
I need to know if I can trust you.

468
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:36,600
If we're still partners.

469
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:38,366
Partners?

470
00:33:39,593 --> 00:33:42,473
You've been giving your partner
the cold shoulder the last six months.

471
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:44,945
Now you're wanted for murder
and you say Rita's missing.

472
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:46,835
- What's going on with you?
- I don't know !

473
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,980
I'm just trying to get control
of this day.

474
00:33:50,177 --> 00:33:51,420
This day is over.

475
00:33:51,745 --> 00:33:53,530
You gotta worry about tomorrow.

476
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:00,368
This...

477
00:34:00,503 --> 00:34:01,910
mess you're in...

478
00:34:02,935 --> 00:34:04,352
have anything to do with the fact

479
00:34:04,353 --> 00:34:06,180
you've been looking into
the Latin disciples?

480
00:34:08,048 --> 00:34:09,300
Where did you hear that?

481
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,468
Don't worry. I haven't told anyone.

482
00:34:16,943 --> 00:34:19,698
I'm working this case
for the U.S. Attorney's office.

483
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,510
It's strictly confidential.

484
00:34:21,914 --> 00:34:24,800
We flipped this kid, Damien Ortiz
against the disciples.

485
00:34:25,216 --> 00:34:26,711
Trial's tomorrow. Now he's on the run.

486
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:28,482
If they're after him,
they're gonna get him.

487
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:30,005
Well, hopefully not before I do.

488
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:33,567
The disciples are involved
in Rita's disappearance?

489
00:34:33,586 --> 00:34:34,941
That's what I'm gonna find out.

490
00:34:36,603 --> 00:34:38,491
I need you to search her place for me.

491
00:34:38,568 --> 00:34:40,071
Check for signs of a struggle,

492
00:34:40,175 --> 00:34:42,102
- run a trace on...
- Cell phone, yeah.

493
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:43,151
Done this before.

494
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:45,220
Does that mean you're gonna help me?

495
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,431
You're gonna need this.

496
00:35:01,841 --> 00:35:02,842
Thanks.

497
00:35:03,708 --> 00:35:04,671
Where you headed?

498
00:35:06,639 --> 00:35:07,664
I'm going clubbing.

499
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:16,711
Hey. I'm Damien's 9:00.

500
00:35:16,879 --> 00:35:18,020
Come on, bring him in.

501
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,190
Arms out to your side.

502
00:35:20,494 --> 00:35:21,599
Turn around.

503
00:35:22,874 --> 00:35:24,540
What do you got here?

504
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,546
Nice.

505
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:28,329
Come on.

506
00:35:34,266 --> 00:35:35,267
Easy!

507
00:35:37,461 --> 00:35:39,780
Listen, wait, wait.
You don't wanna do this, okay?

508
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,869
Get damien,
and we can discuss this like men.

509
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,914
You think that first step's a bitch?
Wait till the next one.

510
00:36:05,953 --> 00:36:06,827
Damien...

511
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,104
Turned me against my own only

512
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,588
- so you could sell my ass out?
- I didn't sell you out!

513
00:36:10,873 --> 00:36:12,887
- Tell me what happened.
- You know what happened.

514
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,600
Your safe house was a death trap.

515
00:36:15,029 --> 00:36:18,863
Why would I be here helping you
while I'm on the run for murder?

516
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,330
- Murder?
- Yeah.

517
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:24,390
- Hey, yo, who you playing?
- Hey, don't you watch the news?

518
00:36:24,771 --> 00:36:27,343
I'm wanted for killing an assistant D.A.

519
00:36:32,036 --> 00:36:34,707
You gotta tell me exactly
what happened D., all right?

520
00:36:34,744 --> 00:36:37,428
'Cause only a handful of people knew
where we were hiding you.

521
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,255
Well, somebody said something, right?

522
00:36:39,332 --> 00:36:41,712
'Cause them Feds that's supposed
to be looking out for me,

523
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:43,140
protecting my ass, are long gone.

524
00:36:43,282 --> 00:36:44,992
I wake up,
don't hear nobody in the house.

525
00:36:45,068 --> 00:36:46,995
Check the window, all the cars are gone.

526
00:36:47,463 --> 00:36:50,161
See some skinheaded fools
coming my way strapped.

527
00:36:50,199 --> 00:36:51,280
Wait, skinheads?

528
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:55,390
- Not disciples?
- Nah, some good ol'hog-ridin' boys.

529
00:36:55,581 --> 00:36:57,044
Look, I ain't no fool, Hop.

530
00:36:57,176 --> 00:36:59,885
I figure the L.D.S farmed it out
make it look like some other crew.

531
00:36:59,897 --> 00:37:03,310
All right, did any of these disciples
say anything about Garza or me?

532
00:37:03,810 --> 00:37:04,734
You?

533
00:37:05,218 --> 00:37:08,070
Nah, this is bigger than you
or some D.A, man.

534
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,570
I need names, Damien.

535
00:37:09,649 --> 00:37:10,770
You're crazy.

536
00:37:11,189 --> 00:37:12,500
Our deal's off, Hop.

537
00:37:12,691 --> 00:37:13,778
You on your own.

538
00:37:15,547 --> 00:37:17,100
Just give me one name, D.

539
00:37:17,172 --> 00:37:19,530
Forget about Feds,
forget about Baxter, all right?

540
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,870
I will personally find you
protection myself.

541
00:37:23,201 --> 00:37:25,846
- Nah, man. I don't think so.
- You're making a mistake.

542
00:37:25,912 --> 00:37:27,230
Just give me a...

543
00:37:50,544 --> 00:37:53,473
You people know you just blew away
a federal witness?

544
00:37:54,201 --> 00:37:55,880
Or is that part of the plan?

545
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:59,114
Forget the kid. We have business
to discuss, detective Hopper.

546
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,640
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I know what you're capable of.

547
00:38:02,219 --> 00:38:05,900
I know you can get at Rita
and my sister and her kids.

548
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:08,030
But if you want me
to take the fall for Garza,

549
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,600
you better not touch them.
You understand me?

550
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,720
How did you know this was about Garza?

551
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,710
You're the one behind the curtain.
You tell me.

552
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:23,250
I need to know how you came
to this information.

553
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,580
What are you talking about

554
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,930
You told me last time I was here.

555
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,630
You think this is a game?

556
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:30,930
Oh, no.

557
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,430
Okay, listen, listen,
I'll do whatever you tell me.

558
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,080
Just don't hurt them!

559
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,150
A little late for that.

560
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,270
For every decision,

561
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,090
there's a consequence.

562
00:38:48,612 --> 00:38:49,774
Stop!

563
00:38:51,478 --> 00:38:52,469
Why?

564
00:38:52,711 --> 00:38:55,240
Tell me why this is happening!

565
00:38:56,822 --> 00:38:58,090
Relax.

566
00:38:58,879 --> 00:39:00,520
Just a mild sedative.

567
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:04,230
We'd like you to... unwind...

568
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:06,719
sleep on it.

569
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,582
But remember, decision... consequence.

570
00:39:18,251 --> 00:39:22,154
<i>decision, consequence.</i>

571
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:27,602
<i>decision, consequence.</i>
