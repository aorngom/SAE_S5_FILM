2
00:00:11,254 --> 00:00:13,258
<i>My name is detective Brett Hopper,</i>

3
00:00:14,044 --> 00:00:16,401
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything...</i>

4
00:00:16,854 --> 00:00:17,815
Put your hands up!

5
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:20,696
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

6
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:22,416
<i>I will be framed for murder...</i>

7
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:24,681
<i>Who the hell are you people?</i>

8
00:00:25,146 --> 00:00:27,179
<i>My girlfriend Rita
will be in danger.</i>

9
00:00:27,624 --> 00:00:30,457
<i>I know all this because I am living
the same day...</i>

10
00:00:31,123 --> 00:00:32,800
<i>over and over again.</i>

11
00:00:32,837 --> 00:00:35,873
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

12
00:00:35,874 --> 00:00:37,305
<i>Every day I get another chance.</i>

13
00:00:37,343 --> 00:00:39,841
<i>For every decision,
there's a consequence.</i>

14
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:43,396
<i>Garza sent evidence to my sister
Jennifer and me before he died.</i>

15
00:00:43,434 --> 00:00:45,989
<i>I think whoever killed this girl
killed Garza.</i>

16
00:00:46,036 --> 00:00:48,072
<i>My partner Andrea helped me
figure out the clues.</i>

17
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,542
<i>That thing you asked about</i>

18
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,377
<i>matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez.</i>

19
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:53,803
<i>He's serving five consecutive
life sentences.</i>

20
00:00:53,841 --> 00:00:56,291
<i>My informant Damien may know something
that can help me,</i>

21
00:00:56,319 --> 00:00:59,298
<i>but Rita's ex-Husband Chad had
the most important Information of all.</i>

22
00:00:59,327 --> 00:01:00,376
<i>Where is it? The book--</i>

23
00:01:00,377 --> 00:01:01,250
- You have it.
- No.

24
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:02,186
You're lying.

25
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:05,756
If you're right, book's
on the front seat of my car.

26
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:07,118
<i>Now that I have the murder book,</i>

27
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:09,714
<i>I have to find out
who the girl in the picture is.</i>

28
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:49,199
<i>That thing you asked about</i>

29
00:01:49,653 --> 00:01:51,832
<i>matched a guy named Miguel Dominguez.</i>

30
00:01:52,285 --> 00:01:54,743
<i>He's been in Pelican Bay since '89, so</i>

31
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:56,741
<i>no way he could have killed anyone.</i>

32
00:02:19,477 --> 00:02:21,544
Keep that lying bitch in the trunk.

33
00:02:22,252 --> 00:02:23,263
I'll be there.

34
00:02:28,533 --> 00:02:30,939
They got Baxter,
but they can't find Hop.

35
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:44,766
I meet a chick like that,
she'll be cooking for me in three days.

36
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:16,299
No. We agreed this be done
a certain way,

37
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:18,249
and now you're changing the plans on me.

38
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:19,574
No, I'm not angry.

39
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,128
I feel like I keep telling you
the same thing over and over.

40
00:03:23,185 --> 00:03:24,212
Bye, mom.

41
00:03:27,733 --> 00:03:28,949
What are you doing here?

42
00:04:16,155 --> 00:04:17,306
That was nice.

43
00:04:17,559 --> 00:04:18,879
That was more than nice.

44
00:04:21,772 --> 00:04:22,866
It's been a while.

45
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,679
A while?

46
00:04:25,269 --> 00:04:26,542
What was last night?

47
00:04:28,464 --> 00:04:30,078
No, I'm just saying--
I guess,

48
00:04:30,134 --> 00:04:32,408
I guess I just can't get enough of you.

49
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:42,849
Where do you think you're going?

50
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:47,428
Gotta go to the station
pick up a murder book

51
00:04:47,429 --> 00:04:49,222
from this cop before he leaves
for the day.

52
00:04:49,712 --> 00:04:51,908
You're in narcotics.
Why do you need a murder book?

53
00:04:52,181 --> 00:04:54,831
This cold case that my pops
was working on back in the day--

54
00:04:54,868 --> 00:04:57,442
may be connected to something
I'm working on right now.

55
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:58,488
Your dad?

56
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:01,283
That's kind of weird.

57
00:05:01,392 --> 00:05:03,890
You and your dad connected
through a murder.

58
00:05:04,588 --> 00:05:06,341
There have been stranger things.

59
00:05:10,497 --> 00:05:12,779
What time you supposed
to go meet this cop?

60
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:15,974
I'm not. I'm just gonna break
into his car and take it.

61
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,973
Yeah, right.

62
00:05:19,425 --> 00:05:20,857
I hope they'll bust you.

63
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:49,556
How you holding up?

64
00:05:50,421 --> 00:05:52,873
Eddie wasn't real happy
about rehab, but...

65
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:54,843
we talked about it.

66
00:05:54,862 --> 00:05:55,936
He knows he needs help.

67
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:57,052
That's good.

68
00:05:57,113 --> 00:05:59,001
Here's the thing you called about.

69
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,555
Miguel Dominguez.

70
00:06:02,186 --> 00:06:03,814
Gang task force didn't have much.

71
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:07,642
This is way too thin for a guy
with five consecutive life sentences.

72
00:06:07,678 --> 00:06:10,469
Yeah, I know. It didn't seem right
to me either, but I checked.

73
00:06:10,497 --> 00:06:11,551
That's it.

74
00:06:14,994 --> 00:06:16,690
Hold up. He's a Latin disciple?

75
00:06:16,794 --> 00:06:18,613
It didn't come up anywhere I checked.

76
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:21,114
It's the first tag G.T.F.
put in the system.

77
00:06:21,426 --> 00:06:23,129
Anybody ask you why you wanted this?

78
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:26,438
But you got me curious.

79
00:06:27,654 --> 00:06:31,261
Is this connected to the L.D. thing
you're working with the feds?

80
00:06:33,802 --> 00:06:34,802
Yeah, I think so.

81
00:06:35,899 --> 00:06:38,252
And you were gonna tell me
about that one day?

82
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,121
All right, you wanna roll with me
on this,

83
00:06:40,152 --> 00:06:43,040
you find out why there's only
two pages on this guy.

84
00:06:44,526 --> 00:06:45,868
I have I.A. in an hour.

85
00:06:47,204 --> 00:06:48,924
God forbid I keep Shelton waiting.

86
00:06:48,948 --> 00:06:50,378
Well... He'll live.

87
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,835
Any leads on the disciples yet?

88
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:55,458
I'm about to go chase one down.

89
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:56,553
Thanks for this.

90
00:07:22,727 --> 00:07:23,797
Where is he?

91
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:26,160
I don't know! I don't know!
I swear, man!

92
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,282
Where's Damien?

93
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:44,417
You gotta be kidding!

94
00:07:55,649 --> 00:07:56,760
We've got a problem.

95
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,526
Hey, <i>ese</i>,
you ain't got no business here.

96
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:19,131
Turn around and keep walking.

97
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,781
My business is with Damien. Move.

98
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:22,931
- You're making a big mistake--
- Move.

99
00:08:26,777 --> 00:08:28,153
It's not what you think!

100
00:08:28,238 --> 00:08:29,256
Go!

101
00:08:49,354 --> 00:08:51,192
You have no right to be here, Hop.

102
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,946
- This is my family.
- I called.

103
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:54,161
You didn't pick up.

104
00:08:54,218 --> 00:08:55,820
You know what this looks like?

105
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:58,912
The lack of respect?
You coming up in here with a gun?

106
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:01,363
My moms is here.

107
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:03,160
What the hell is wrong with you?

108
00:09:03,197 --> 00:09:06,138
I thought you had more sense
than this. You're on the run, D.

109
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,447
There are skinheads out there
looking for you right now.

110
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:09,562
You think I'm running?

111
00:09:09,842 --> 00:09:11,349
People look for me
everyday, Hop.

112
00:09:11,372 --> 00:09:12,840
I ain't hiding' from nobody.

113
00:09:13,054 --> 00:09:15,640
And being here is important, all right?

114
00:09:15,836 --> 00:09:19,328
I promised my niece I'd make it
to her party, and I keep my promises--

115
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:21,153
Something you need to work on.

116
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:24,402
You lucky I'm with my family,
or I'd deal with you myself.

117
00:09:24,417 --> 00:09:25,462
Yeah. We need to talk.

118
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:26,582
Get out of here, all right?

119
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,775
Before I change my mind
about letting you leave.

120
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:29,890
Two minutes...

121
00:09:30,097 --> 00:09:31,106
outside.

122
00:09:36,212 --> 00:09:38,355
I'm gonna be right back,
all right, loco?

123
00:09:38,393 --> 00:09:39,858
Let me handle this <i>hura</i>.

124
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,807
Better make it quick, Hop.

125
00:09:53,721 --> 00:09:57,406
I may be your boy, D,
but I'm not one of your boys.

126
00:09:58,358 --> 00:09:59,584
We straight on that?

127
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,356
I'm gonna remember this.

128
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:03,579
Shut up and listen.

129
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,854
Miguel Dominguez--

130
00:10:06,145 --> 00:10:08,652
He's a Latin disciple connected
to a murder I'm looking into.

131
00:10:08,653 --> 00:10:10,173
You want me to help you?

132
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,293
Hop, you don't get that kind of love,
all right?

133
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,735
Everything that's happening to you
right now, D.--

134
00:10:15,763 --> 00:10:17,979
The skinheads,
the hit on the safe house--

135
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,006
All goes back to this guy...

136
00:10:20,524 --> 00:10:21,627
to this case.

137
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,274
What's that?

138
00:10:28,777 --> 00:10:29,832
It's a murder book.

139
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,152
Any info on a murder goes right in here.

140
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,859
So this is how you catch bad guys?

141
00:10:34,452 --> 00:10:35,452
Some of 'em.

142
00:10:38,204 --> 00:10:39,326
Who's this?

143
00:10:39,392 --> 00:10:40,462
She's a Jane Doe.

144
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:42,560
Looks more like a Juanita to me.

145
00:10:43,147 --> 00:10:47,361
Look here. Now this hourglass
was found next to her dead body.

146
00:10:47,587 --> 00:10:49,246
L.D. prints were all over it.

147
00:10:50,255 --> 00:10:51,895
So go catch him, Shaft.

148
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,137
Already been caught.

149
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:56,948
Dominguez has been doing life,
Pelican Bay, since '89.

150
00:10:57,042 --> 00:10:58,979
Problem is, she was killed in '91.

151
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:00,721
Well, he's definitely Fam.

152
00:11:01,576 --> 00:11:04,376
Old school as hell, but he ain't
ringing no bells. What'd he do?

153
00:11:04,441 --> 00:11:06,232
Killed his parents in their sleep.

154
00:11:06,276 --> 00:11:08,712
Arrest report said the cops
found him in the kitchen,

155
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:10,313
Eating on a bowl of cereal,
still had--

156
00:11:10,332 --> 00:11:11,690
Still had the blood all over him.

157
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:12,963
So then you do know him?

158
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:14,752
Not as no damn Dominguez, bro.

159
00:11:15,177 --> 00:11:16,275
Well, as who?

160
00:11:19,695 --> 00:11:21,052
<i>El Lloròn.</i>

161
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:24,182
The Crying Man.

162
00:11:24,588 --> 00:11:27,227
We don't talk about him, Hop... ever.

163
00:11:27,321 --> 00:11:29,239
Well, you about to talk right now.

164
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,205
He's the bogey-man.

165
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,580
Someone goes missing,
must be <i>El Lloròn.</i>

166
00:11:33,957 --> 00:11:36,503
Kid don't eat his vegetables,
you tell him <i>El Lloròn</i> is coming,

167
00:11:36,504 --> 00:11:37,709
and he cleans his plate.

168
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,093
He's like Freddy...

169
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,780
kill you in your dreams.

170
00:11:45,095 --> 00:11:47,038
- This is where she was found?
- You know it?

171
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:48,153
L.D. Territory?

172
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,857
- Nah, man.
- Come on, don't waste my time, D.

173
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:53,788
Look, Hop. I got nothing more to say
about El Lloròn.

174
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:58,803
But I might be able
to help you with her.

175
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:28,263
Hop.

176
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:35,070
El Madre Magdalena...

177
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,156
She wants to know why
you're looking for her.

178
00:12:45,042 --> 00:12:47,115
Tell her I need to know who she is...

179
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:48,765
and why she died.

180
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:08,003
The sister's been looking after
immigrants

181
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,481
and illegals since I was growing up.

182
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:12,734
Somebody goes missing,

183
00:13:13,366 --> 00:13:14,563
the families come to her.

184
00:13:32,391 --> 00:13:33,768
They're all missing?

185
00:13:36,718 --> 00:13:37,736
Yeah.

186
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:43,307
I knew her.

187
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:47,097
She used to live down the street
from me when I was growing up.

188
00:13:48,058 --> 00:13:51,051
Not that many. We should be out of here
in no time, right?

189
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:59,447
All right, where do you wanna start?

190
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:05,568
Just start at the beginning.

191
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:08,518
I already told you,
Brett was with me all night.

192
00:14:08,547 --> 00:14:12,091
Ms. Shelton, if we could just go
through the night one more time.

193
00:14:12,317 --> 00:14:13,468
He didn't do this.

194
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,030
He got to my house around 9:00.

195
00:14:18,077 --> 00:14:22,419
He stopped and got Chinese, we watched
a movie and we went to bed around 11:30.

196
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:25,162
Did you fall asleep together?

197
00:14:25,505 --> 00:14:28,739
I woke up to use the restroom
around 2:30, he was still asleep.

198
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,184
He was with me all night.

199
00:14:49,308 --> 00:14:50,428
Will you excuse me?

200
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:59,326
She seems pretty credible.

201
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,660
Why, because she's cute?

202
00:15:01,346 --> 00:15:04,532
How about because she hasn't flinched
from anything we've asked?

203
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:06,469
- I believe her.
- If she's telling the truth,

204
00:15:06,497 --> 00:15:07,534
someone's lying.

205
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:09,994
Tell him what you told me.

206
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,248
'Bout to get outta here.

207
00:15:11,446 --> 00:15:14,425
Man, this toy cop over here said
I had some dime bags on me.

208
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:17,781
Now I did have 'em, but y'all need
to let me back out on the streets,

209
00:15:17,828 --> 00:15:19,854
- 'cause you know I'm on the same team.
- Team?

210
00:15:19,883 --> 00:15:22,369
Yeah, I been putting' in work
for Hopper, man.

211
00:15:22,614 --> 00:15:24,047
I'm one of his C.I.S.

212
00:15:24,349 --> 00:15:26,036
This is what you brought me here for,
man?

213
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:28,411
Matter of fact,
I saw my man this morning.

214
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:31,935
You saw Hopper today?

215
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,443
Yeah.

216
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:37,770
Let's talk some more. Come on.

217
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:39,213
What? Come on, man.

218
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,579
I been up here all day.

219
00:15:52,984 --> 00:15:54,586
Yo, Hop, this is way too much work.

220
00:15:54,615 --> 00:15:56,547
Why don't you just tell me
about El Lloròn?

221
00:15:56,566 --> 00:15:58,112
We don't have to mess with all this.

222
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,588
We're in the basement of a church,
nobody can hear you.

223
00:16:00,634 --> 00:16:03,745
What, you don't think the devil
ever goes to church?

224
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,930
She said, "why does a man
who's wanted for murder

225
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:15,975
care so much for a lost soul?"

226
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:23,292
Cops been rolling through the hood
looking for you, Hop.

227
00:16:23,310 --> 00:16:24,760
Tell her I was framed.

228
00:16:25,827 --> 00:16:27,771
This girl can lead me to the truth.

229
00:16:39,643 --> 00:16:41,547
- 'Cause...
- Yeah, I know, I got it.

230
00:16:43,498 --> 00:16:45,135
She still needs to be found.

231
00:17:36,385 --> 00:17:39,079
We need to see if this girl's mother
still lives around here.

232
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,080
You know what?

233
00:17:40,382 --> 00:17:42,560
Here on out, you need to do this
on your own, Hop.

234
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:44,713
If this is all connected to El Lloròn,

235
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:47,230
I ain't trying' to be involved
on that level.

236
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:48,842
You already are, Damien.

237
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,418
Rita, is everything okay?

238
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:57,732
<i>Brett, where are you?</i>

239
00:17:57,949 --> 00:17:59,391
- What's wrong?
<i>- This 2 detectives</i>

240
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,814
came and pull me off my job.
They grilled me.

241
00:18:01,842 --> 00:18:03,963
- Wait, Chad didn't come get you?
<i>- Chad?</i>

242
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,735
I haven't talk to Chad in weeks.

243
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,183
<i>Brett, they're saying you killed a man.</i>

244
00:18:08,252 --> 00:18:10,109
I know, I know and I didn't do it.

245
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:11,408
I'll explain all that later.

246
00:18:11,409 --> 00:18:14,242
Listen, for now, stay in the house,
no matter what.

247
00:18:14,662 --> 00:18:16,919
All right, I'm gonna call you
right back.

248
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,997
<i>You reach Chad Shelton,
leave a message.</i>

249
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:28,982
Yeah, man, where are you?

250
00:18:29,853 --> 00:18:31,780
No. We agreed this would be done
a certain way,

251
00:18:31,785 --> 00:18:33,604
and now you're changing the plans on me.

252
00:18:33,632 --> 00:18:34,801
No, I'm not angry.

253
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:38,119
I just feel like I keep telling you
the same thing over and over.

254
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:39,552
Bye, mom.

255
00:18:43,048 --> 00:18:44,381
What are you doing here?

256
00:19:05,825 --> 00:19:07,173
This is my family.

257
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,250
Two minutes.

258
00:19:24,178 --> 00:19:25,236
Thank you, sister.

259
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,550
All right, let's go.

260
00:19:33,683 --> 00:19:34,557
Excuse me.

261
00:19:34,558 --> 00:19:37,028
I told you, he'll see you
when he's ready.

262
00:19:39,934 --> 00:19:41,110
Okay, you know what?

263
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,987
Tell him he can find me in narcotics.

264
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,810
Yeah, it's me.

265
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:48,242
Reschedule Battle.

266
00:19:49,824 --> 00:19:50,995
He lost the book.

267
00:19:51,146 --> 00:19:52,818
How's your next week looking?

268
00:20:05,474 --> 00:20:08,438
Don't stress, Hop. This side of town,
you blend right in.

269
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,744
Yeah, right, with this bull's-Eye
on my chest.

270
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:14,260
Bull's-Eye? That's more like an "s."
Today you're "Supercop."

271
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:18,538
I still can't figure how you found
that picture so fast.

272
00:20:18,611 --> 00:20:20,421
Been looking for it for a while.

273
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,289
I hate this part.

274
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,524
I know what you mean.

275
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:39,874
- Yes?
- Ma'am, I'm detective Hopper.

276
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,085
Are you related to Isabella Contreras?

277
00:20:46,353 --> 00:20:47,529
Yes, I'm her mother.

278
00:20:50,226 --> 00:20:51,578
May we come in, please?

279
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
Thank you.

280
00:21:13,415 --> 00:21:17,461
Yes ma'am, we've finally figured out
what has happened to Isabella.

281
00:21:21,167 --> 00:21:23,108
I hate to say this to you, but...

282
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,038
your daughter Isabella
has been killed, Ms. Contreras.

283
00:21:31,604 --> 00:21:32,644
<i>Con permiso</i>, I...

284
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:35,050
I've forgotten where the tea is.

285
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:45,105
Ms. Contreras...

286
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,614
See?

287
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,023
She was just here yesterday.

288
00:22:04,415 --> 00:22:05,415
Who?

289
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:06,701
Isabella?

290
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:10,816
Yes. She told me
before she went to work that...

291
00:22:11,695 --> 00:22:13,141
she would be back tomorrow.

292
00:22:13,444 --> 00:22:14,464
Tomorrow?

293
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:17,457
I'm sorry, the tea.

294
00:22:22,418 --> 00:22:25,560
Damn, Hop. She thinks
her daughter's still alive.

295
00:22:26,727 --> 00:22:28,292
You need to go through her things?

296
00:22:29,384 --> 00:22:32,521
I'm just saying, you need to show
some more respect for the dead.

297
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:34,933
I'm trying to find her killer, Damien.

298
00:22:35,013 --> 00:22:36,307
What do you call that?

299
00:23:03,699 --> 00:23:05,955
Hotel soaps and shampoos.

300
00:23:06,326 --> 00:23:07,930
Maybe she worked at a hotel,

301
00:23:08,686 --> 00:23:10,774
cleaned rooms, kept a few nice things.

302
00:23:10,954 --> 00:23:14,184
You ever heard of a hotel maid
that could afford dinner at Morton's...

303
00:23:20,807 --> 00:23:21,893
Or these?

304
00:23:24,451 --> 00:23:25,956
She had a <i>papi chulo.</i>

305
00:23:28,043 --> 00:23:29,866
What, that means "sugar daddy"?

306
00:23:30,543 --> 00:23:31,895
I'm right with you.

307
00:23:34,035 --> 00:23:37,068
Ms. Contreras,
did Isabella work at a hotel?

308
00:23:37,352 --> 00:23:40,262
No, a very expensive club.

309
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:44,021
She tells me all the time
how nice the people are--

310
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:45,259
very wealthy.

311
00:23:45,536 --> 00:23:47,300
You know the name of the club?

312
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:49,258
She said it all the time.

313
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:55,849
Just come back tomorrow when she's home.
Then you can ask Isabella the name.

314
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:03,710
- Ma'am, I can't come back tomorrow.
- Isabella will be sorry she missed you.

315
00:24:06,353 --> 00:24:09,206
I wish I had Mr. Detweiler's number.

316
00:24:09,538 --> 00:24:10,538
He'd remember.

317
00:24:11,227 --> 00:24:12,227
Detweiler?

318
00:24:12,351 --> 00:24:15,776
Yes. He got Isabella the job
at the club.

319
00:24:17,978 --> 00:24:20,154
You really should come back tomorrow.

320
00:24:26,685 --> 00:24:29,057
Now we've gotta find this guy Detweiler.

321
00:24:29,728 --> 00:24:31,688
I was cool helping you
with sister Magdalena,

322
00:24:31,742 --> 00:24:33,616
but after that crazy-ass old lady,

323
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:36,760
you can do this little "Tenspeed
and Brown Shoe" routine by yourself.

324
00:24:39,334 --> 00:24:42,102
In case you forgot, I got my own drama.

325
00:24:42,495 --> 00:24:43,506
Yeah.

326
00:24:51,225 --> 00:24:52,512
Sure, I'll be there.

327
00:25:03,351 --> 00:25:04,351
He's good.

328
00:25:13,268 --> 00:25:15,032
How the hell did they find us?

329
00:25:16,823 --> 00:25:17,890
Get down!

330
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,922
Punk-Ass bitches blew up my ride.

331
00:25:41,553 --> 00:25:42,705
We gotta bounce.

332
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,236
I don't give a damn about that truck.

333
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:03,951
Listen, anybody come
near my family--

334
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,792
Mama, Rosa, anybody--
You burn them to hell.

335
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,050
You take me back to my truck?

336
00:26:13,766 --> 00:26:14,942
I got a better idea.

337
00:26:19,889 --> 00:26:20,889
Move.

338
00:26:21,643 --> 00:26:23,231
Hey, I just saved your ass.

339
00:26:24,142 --> 00:26:25,436
<i>Tu eres una maldiciòn.</i>

340
00:26:25,705 --> 00:26:26,639
What?

341
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,640
You're bad luck.

342
00:26:28,078 --> 00:26:29,709
Man, whatever. Just take me to my truck.

343
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:32,014
Your legs ain't broke. Use 'em.

344
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:34,577
Yo, wait!

345
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,643
Forgot my damn...

346
00:26:40,881 --> 00:26:41,920
phone.

347
00:26:58,330 --> 00:26:59,705
Yeah, Andrea, it's me.

348
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,365
Hopper, I heard something
on the way over here.

349
00:27:07,421 --> 00:27:09,894
I know, I gotta tell you about that.

350
00:27:10,846 --> 00:27:12,067
You know about Chad?

351
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:17,106
He was gunned down at an A.T.M.
on Olympic and Gope.

352
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:19,854
- What?
- They think it was an armed robbery.

353
00:27:24,615 --> 00:27:25,615
Okay...

354
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:29,606
Damien was attacked, and Chad was...

355
00:27:33,304 --> 00:27:34,936
This has never happened before.

356
00:27:35,106 --> 00:27:36,514
What are you talking about?

357
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:38,658
You gotta take me to Rita's.

358
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:50,478
I can't stop crying.

359
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:53,856
How'd you find out?

360
00:27:55,177 --> 00:27:58,683
They called me at the police station.
He still had me as a contact.

361
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,769
Well, he was your husband.

362
00:28:03,394 --> 00:28:07,315
I know Chad and I had our problems,
but he was a decent man.

363
00:28:08,806 --> 00:28:10,394
He was good in his own way.

364
00:28:10,778 --> 00:28:14,163
He just... He didn't have
to die like that, so senseless.

365
00:28:16,304 --> 00:28:20,187
After they told me, all I could keep
thinking about was you being safe.

366
00:28:25,179 --> 00:28:27,605
- They said...
- I know, I know. It's not true.

367
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,116
Then you shouldn't even be here
if they're looking for you.

368
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:34,764
No, I wanted to make sure
you were all right.

369
00:28:36,618 --> 00:28:37,618
You should go.

370
00:28:38,806 --> 00:28:41,511
If anything was
to ever happen to you, Brett...

371
00:28:47,806 --> 00:28:49,158
I'm not going anywhere.

372
00:28:50,432 --> 00:28:51,805
- Stop it.
- I don't believe you.

373
00:28:51,806 --> 00:28:52,993
Seriously, I gotta go.

374
00:28:54,684 --> 00:28:56,808
So you're saying no to breakfast?

375
00:28:58,053 --> 00:28:59,678
When do you eat? I never see you eat.

376
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,178
I eat, it's just...

377
00:29:01,179 --> 00:29:03,531
I know, cop stuff.

378
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:05,054
- Cop stuff.
- Come on.

379
00:29:05,738 --> 00:29:07,372
So what do you have to do today?

380
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:10,511
Today I gotta find a guy
named Detweiler. All right?

381
00:29:11,953 --> 00:29:12,953
Later.

382
00:29:51,455 --> 00:29:53,914
<i>You're going to admit
to killing Alberto Garza.</i>

383
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:55,602
<i>Consequence... decision...</i>

384
00:29:55,658 --> 00:29:57,166
<i>Tell me why this is happening!</i>

385
00:29:57,252 --> 00:29:58,631
<i>I swear to god,</i>

386
00:29:59,264 --> 00:30:00,691
<i>I will find you.</i>

387
00:30:02,142 --> 00:30:03,142
Can I help you?

388
00:30:08,068 --> 00:30:09,868
Why are you doing this?

389
00:30:10,527 --> 00:30:14,832
That's funny, when I asked you why,
you shoved a needle in my neck.

390
00:30:15,367 --> 00:30:16,519
Conrad!

391
00:30:18,121 --> 00:30:19,438
Margaret, call 9-1-1.

392
00:30:19,630 --> 00:30:21,939
Yeah, Margaret, why don't you do that?

393
00:30:22,828 --> 00:30:23,828
What do you want?

394
00:30:25,956 --> 00:30:27,838
You're gonna tell me everything,

395
00:30:28,016 --> 00:30:31,898
and then you're gonna give me
one reason why I shouldn't kill you.

396
00:30:33,453 --> 00:30:34,511
Well, there's one.

397
00:30:36,248 --> 00:30:37,862
I'm gonna count to three.

398
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,580
One...

399
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,637
Two...

400
00:30:47,953 --> 00:30:50,423
Mr. Detweiler,
I'm detective Brett Hopper.

401
00:30:50,831 --> 00:30:51,948
How can I help you?

402
00:30:52,831 --> 00:30:56,772
Just so we're clear, I know
who you are and what you're capable of.

403
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:59,173
I'm sorry. I don't follow.

404
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:05,118
I also know that your wife Margaret
is in the house with a shotgun.

405
00:31:05,373 --> 00:31:06,611
Don't call for help.

406
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,516
Sure you don't want some?

407
00:31:10,517 --> 00:31:13,340
I wanna know about Garza
and the Contreras girl.

408
00:31:14,017 --> 00:31:16,958
I wanna know why the hell
you're doing this to me.

409
00:31:17,331 --> 00:31:18,331
Conrad.

410
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:21,518
You didn't say you had company.

411
00:31:22,232 --> 00:31:25,322
Margaret.
Dear, this is detective Hopper.

412
00:31:27,145 --> 00:31:28,145
Hello, detective.

413
00:31:33,042 --> 00:31:36,082
Remember, Timmy's birthday party
is today at 4:00...

414
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,681
Address is on your desk.

415
00:31:38,954 --> 00:31:40,189
Pleasure to meet you.

416
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:57,527
Does your family know
what kind of a man you are?

417
00:31:57,955 --> 00:32:00,660
That you torture
and kill people for a living?

418
00:32:00,832 --> 00:32:05,358
- My family is none of your business.
- You made my family your business.

419
00:32:05,576 --> 00:32:07,144
I'm just playing along.

420
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:16,623
Timmy...

421
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:18,286
He's a good-looking kid.

422
00:32:18,642 --> 00:32:20,524
Looks just like his mother, Lila.

423
00:32:21,645 --> 00:32:23,736
I bet you can't wait to go see them,

424
00:32:23,737 --> 00:32:26,233
along
with your other daughter Catherine.

425
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:29,592
Yeah, they have
a really nice place in Westwood.

426
00:32:32,145 --> 00:32:34,833
- And when did you discover this?
- Today.

427
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,527
Well, sorry if I seem unimpressed,

428
00:32:38,387 --> 00:32:41,316
but you need to understand
that I've been doing this sort of thing

429
00:32:41,364 --> 00:32:43,513
since you were a little boy
with a toy badge,

430
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,639
chasing after your father's shadow.

431
00:32:46,094 --> 00:32:48,926
What the hell do you know
about my father?

432
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,080
You're not that kind of man.

433
00:32:53,081 --> 00:32:54,894
You don't know what kind of a man I am.

434
00:32:54,895 --> 00:32:56,659
Trust me when I say that I do,

435
00:32:57,458 --> 00:33:00,516
and you are nothing like
the people that I work for.

436
00:33:01,724 --> 00:33:03,453
What people?

437
00:33:04,351 --> 00:33:05,626
Who do you work for?

438
00:33:05,831 --> 00:33:08,331
People who'd do far worse
than threaten my family.

439
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:10,954
People who would do far worse
than put a gun to my head,

440
00:33:11,038 --> 00:33:12,692
because that's never been done before.

441
00:33:12,796 --> 00:33:15,603
- You're gonna take me to them.
- No, I'm not.

442
00:33:15,708 --> 00:33:17,002
Then you're gonna die.

443
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:20,830
Hopper...

444
00:33:21,886 --> 00:33:23,376
What you don't realize is

445
00:33:23,377 --> 00:33:25,999
that I am prepared
to do whatever it takes

446
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,845
in order to protect my family.

447
00:33:29,396 --> 00:33:30,396
So...

448
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:32,697
go ahead.

449
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,270
Pull the trigger.

450
00:33:46,021 --> 00:33:47,021
Can I help you?

451
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,727
Here, everything you want is inside--

452
00:33:49,983 --> 00:33:52,459
The murder book, the hourglass,
the photo, all of it.

453
00:33:52,535 --> 00:33:53,896
Just make it stop.

454
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:57,295
- Don't know what you're talking about.
- You don't have to come after me,

455
00:33:57,361 --> 00:33:58,343
my sister or Rita.

456
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:00,162
All right?
It ends today, you understand?

457
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:02,617
You and the people you work for,
you win.

458
00:34:02,772 --> 00:34:04,007
It's not that simple.

459
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:07,712
Make it stop.

460
00:35:12,901 --> 00:35:14,195
He came to your house.

461
00:35:14,837 --> 00:35:17,336
I assume there must be a leak
at the station.

462
00:35:17,337 --> 00:35:21,689
Maybe you should have asked Hopper
how he found you before you let him go.

463
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,699
Sorry, I felt letting him leave

464
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:26,194
was the best way
to handle the situation,

465
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:28,291
especially after he left this.

466
00:35:29,465 --> 00:35:30,582
He had everything...

467
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:34,003
- The hourglass, the missing film...
- He had the murder book.

468
00:35:35,277 --> 00:35:36,344
How did he get it?

469
00:35:39,324 --> 00:35:40,401
I don't know.

470
00:35:41,524 --> 00:35:43,347
What did he hope to accomplish?

471
00:35:45,465 --> 00:35:47,347
All he said was, "make it stop."

472
00:35:48,087 --> 00:35:50,557
Beyond that,
I have no idea what he knows.

473
00:35:51,712 --> 00:35:53,738
<i>They're not going
to be happy you allowed</i>

474
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:55,403
<i>Hopper to make contact with you.</i>

475
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:56,874
<i>And how should I proceed?</i>

476
00:35:58,027 --> 00:36:02,027
<i>If he took the murder book, he knows
much more than he's letting on.</i>

477
00:36:04,777 --> 00:36:05,777
Burn it all down.

478
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:09,797
The cop who lost the book...

479
00:36:11,088 --> 00:36:12,911
<i>He was gunned down at an A.T.M.</i>

480
00:36:13,464 --> 00:36:14,522
The gang leader...

481
00:36:18,402 --> 00:36:19,402
Hopper...

482
00:36:22,902 --> 00:36:23,902
Kill them all.

483
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,152
<i>And the girl?</i>

484
00:36:29,214 --> 00:36:30,802
<i>I'll take care of the girl.</i>

485
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:50,777
Damien, shut up and listen.

486
00:36:50,778 --> 00:36:52,901
The skinheads are still out there
looking for you.

487
00:36:52,973 --> 00:36:55,949
They're in a black van with a woman
painted on the back.

488
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:57,676
They're trying to kill you.

489
00:37:04,778 --> 00:37:06,013
Andrea, listen to me.

490
00:37:06,392 --> 00:37:07,518
I need you to do something.

491
00:37:07,584 --> 00:37:09,837
- Jen, are you all right?
- Yeah, Brett, what's wrong?

492
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:11,520
- Where are you?
<i>- On my way to the mall.</i>

493
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:12,935
- Is everything all right?
<i>- Yeah,</i>

494
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:14,477
I just wanted to make sure you're okay.

495
00:37:14,543 --> 00:37:15,592
<i>I'm fine.</i>

496
00:37:15,762 --> 00:37:18,144
- Where's Randall and the kids?
<i>- At the house.</i>

497
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:20,006
Jen, I need you to get home immediately.

498
00:37:20,141 --> 00:37:22,693
Tell Randall if he sees anything shady,
to call the cops.

499
00:37:22,827 --> 00:37:24,605
- Brett...
- Jen, please, just do it.

500
00:37:56,632 --> 00:37:58,313
<i>- Yeah.</i> - We've got the girl.

501
00:38:00,882 --> 00:38:01,882
Good.

502
00:38:03,319 --> 00:38:04,319
I'm on my way.

503
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,014
Nah, he's around here somewhere.

504
00:38:13,194 --> 00:38:15,613
They don't stray too far
from where they live.

505
00:38:15,764 --> 00:38:19,170
Tell Fencik once we take care
of this garbage, we'll call.

506
00:38:27,104 --> 00:38:28,134
Hey...

507
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:30,835
Heard you were looking for me.

508
00:38:36,622 --> 00:38:38,383
We agreed
this would be done a certain way,

509
00:38:38,386 --> 00:38:40,266
and now you're changing the plans on me.

510
00:38:40,361 --> 00:38:41,570
No, I'm not angry.

511
00:38:41,681 --> 00:38:44,714
I just feel like I keep telling you
the same thing over and over.

512
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,196
'Bye, mom.

513
00:38:49,885 --> 00:38:53,649
What are you doing here?

514
00:38:54,951 --> 00:38:56,520
Tell you the truth,

515
00:38:57,507 --> 00:38:58,825
I'm not so sure.

516
00:39:16,091 --> 00:39:17,773
I thought something happened to you.

517
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:19,126
I'm okay. What's...

518
00:39:19,196 --> 00:39:21,320
- Those detectives said...
- I know what they said...

519
00:39:21,321 --> 00:39:22,321
I didn't do it.

520
00:39:23,696 --> 00:39:25,568
Why... Why is this happening?

521
00:39:35,321 --> 00:39:37,816
A lot of people
could have been hurt today

522
00:39:37,817 --> 00:39:39,556
because of something I did...

523
00:39:41,070 --> 00:39:42,222
Something I took.

524
00:39:44,197 --> 00:39:45,483
I don't understand.

525
00:39:49,523 --> 00:39:52,206
The most important thing
is that you're okay.

526
00:40:30,572 --> 00:40:31,572
Where's the girl?

527
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:35,868
You said you had her.

528
00:40:41,134 --> 00:40:43,075
This is not a night for mistakes.

529
00:40:43,322 --> 00:40:44,322
I agree, sir.

530
00:40:46,382 --> 00:40:47,676
So what's the problem?

531
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:02,158
You let him come to your house.

532
00:41:09,143 --> 00:41:10,824
Finish it.

533
00:41:10,863 --> 00:41:12,110
You just remember,

534
00:41:12,204 --> 00:41:14,302
next time it could be you.

535
00:41:33,874 --> 00:41:36,368
People are always wondering
what the difference is

536
00:41:36,369 --> 00:41:38,750
between a warning and an example.

537
00:41:40,772 --> 00:41:43,039
The difference is rather simple.

538
00:41:44,577 --> 00:41:46,552
Most people don't heed warnings.

539
00:41:46,665 --> 00:41:49,301
But hey learn from examples.

540
00:41:52,883 --> 00:41:54,290
This is an example...

541
00:41:56,326 --> 00:41:58,235
how we bury our secrets.

542
00:42:03,432 --> 00:42:05,048
I understand.
