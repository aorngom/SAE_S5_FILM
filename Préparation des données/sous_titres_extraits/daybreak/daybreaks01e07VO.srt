00:00:07,609 --> 00:00:09,546
<i>My name is Detective Brett Hopper</i>

3
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:12,669
<i>And this is the day
that changes everything...</i>

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:14,125
Freeze! Your hands up!

5
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:16,757
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant DA Alberto Garza.

6
00:00:16,819 --> 00:00:18,272
<i>I will be framed for murder...</i>

7
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:20,856
Who the hell are you people ?

8
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,267
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

9
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:26,727
<i>I know all this because I am living
the same day,</i>

10
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:29,128
<i>over and over again.</i>

11
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,018
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

12
00:00:32,246 --> 00:00:34,405
I thought it'd be different this time.
Didn't you?

13
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:38,674
We taste the same!
We all taste just like chicken!

14
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,152
<i>Every day I get another chance.</i>

15
00:00:40,163 --> 00:00:42,268
For every decision,
there's a consequence.

16
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:44,263
<i>Before he died, Garza sent me evidence</i>

17
00:00:44,264 --> 00:00:46,649
<i>for an old murder case,
one my father worked on.</i>

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:48,305
<i>This girl can lead me to the truth.</i>

19
00:00:48,306 --> 00:00:51,070
<i>Mr. Detweiler got Isabella the job.</i>

20
00:00:51,273 --> 00:00:53,032
<i>And I thought I found the guy behind it.</i>

21
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,239
I wanna know why the hell
you're doing this to me.

22
00:00:55,415 --> 00:00:56,934
<i>But he works for someone else.</i>

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,424
<i>I don't know who,
but I have his license plate.</i>

24
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:01,204
<i>How the hell shall I proceed?</i>

25
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,581
Kill them all.

26
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:05,358
<i>Now, I have to find out who he is.</i>

27
00:01:19,077 --> 00:01:20,242
Somebody's tense.

28
00:01:23,762 --> 00:01:25,190
Scratch your face.

29
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:27,649
Are you growing a beard or something?

30
00:01:29,198 --> 00:01:31,876
No, I guess I haven't had time to shave.

31
00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:33,997
I thought you shaved it yesterday.

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,034
What happened, here?

33
00:01:42,858 --> 00:01:43,869
Nothing.

34
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,812
Did I say something wrong?

35
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:52,672
Sometimes, I just can't take
the same questions, you know ?

36
00:01:54,903 --> 00:01:56,686
If you wanna grow a full beard,

37
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:58,703
it's fine by me. Bring it on!

38
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,957
Baby, what's going on with you?

39
00:02:06,053 --> 00:02:07,083
Come on, tell me.

40
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:10,376
<i>You wanna tell me about it?
What's going on?</i>

41
00:02:10,403 --> 00:02:11,920
<i>Why is this happening?</i>

42
00:02:12,016 --> 00:02:14,066
<i>I just wanna know what happened
to the man...</i>

43
00:02:14,151 --> 00:02:16,206
<i>There's a lot
you're not telling me.</i>

44
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:17,663
I just feel stuck.

45
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,452
Stuck?

46
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:23,691
- What, like... with us?
- With everything.

47
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:26,432
Well, last time I checked,
I'm part of everything.

48
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:28,741
- Is not you, okay?
-Okay. So what is it?

49
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:30,066
Fine!

50
00:02:30,627 --> 00:02:32,929
I thought I found the bad guy
in this case I'm working.

51
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:35,336
But it turns out he works
for somebody that's even worse.

52
00:02:35,373 --> 00:02:36,917
And I don't know who is he,

53
00:02:36,918 --> 00:02:39,423
what he looks like
and I don't know his name.

54
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:41,155
All I got is a licence plate number.

55
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:43,170
But it's not you.

56
00:02:43,936 --> 00:02:47,477
This is something
I gotta figure out by myself.

57
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:05,052
<i>They're not going to be happy.</i>

58
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:06,931
<i>You allowed Hopper
to make contact with you.</i>

59
00:03:06,932 --> 00:03:08,817
<i>He knows much more
than he's letting off.</i>

60
00:03:09,326 --> 00:03:11,530
Oh yes, this is Detective Choi.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,027
I need you to run
a licence plate for me, please.

62
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:15,670
1-E-4-9-9-0-8.

63
00:03:15,814 --> 00:03:17,654
Do you have an address on that?

64
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,684
- Excuse me, can I ask you a question?
- Deliveries are around back.

65
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,681
Let's do this one more time.

66
00:03:52,831 --> 00:03:53,952
I have a question.

67
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:56,217
Those cars out front, who uses them?

68
00:03:56,383 --> 00:03:58,582
All of the cars are licenced
to the Santayana Club

69
00:03:58,773 --> 00:04:00,317
for the exclusive use of our members.

70
00:04:00,318 --> 00:04:02,566
Well, I'm interested
in Conrad Detweiler.

71
00:04:03,464 --> 00:04:04,522
Who drives him?

72
00:04:04,989 --> 00:04:07,724
This is a private club, sir.
I'm afraid I can't divulge that info...

73
00:04:07,725 --> 00:04:08,764
Can't or won't ?

74
00:04:09,004 --> 00:04:12,010
The director of operations
handles all tranportation matters.

75
00:04:12,201 --> 00:04:13,258
If you'll excuse me.

76
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:18,070
Punk!

77
00:04:22,906 --> 00:04:23,939
Excuse me, sir.

78
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:25,365
Lloyd, please.

79
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,417
Okay. Lloyd, I need to know
where the director's office is, please.

80
00:04:28,845 --> 00:04:30,173
You a new member, sir?

81
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,632
Yeah. I'm planning on joining.
I just need one of these guys

82
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,055
to sponsor me.

83
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,893
Do that and your first drink's on me.

84
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,438
Director's office is to the left.

85
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:52,310
<i>I got you one of the best
criminal defense attorney</i>

86
00:04:52,347 --> 00:04:53,530
<i>in the state. Barry Coldburn.</i>

87
00:04:53,653 --> 00:04:54,657
Can I help you?

88
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:56,453
I hope not.

89
00:04:59,068 --> 00:05:01,872
<i>Terry, report. I want your status.
Have you stopped the suspect?</i>

90
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:03,479
Soltis, hallway is clear.

91
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:06,672
I don't see this guy anywhere.

92
00:05:42,556 --> 00:05:44,312
Excuse me, what are you doing in here?

93
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:46,265
Sir, I'm detective Brett Hopper.

94
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:49,049
- If you have a moment, I'd like--
- I'm so sorry, detective.

95
00:05:49,204 --> 00:05:52,632
You are in the wrong place, everyone
else is upstairs in the dinner room.

96
00:05:54,423 --> 00:05:56,667
Did you see anyone else in my office?

97
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:57,831
No, should I have?

98
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:00,817
Everything this morning has been
so unexpected.

99
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:03,535
You never know
what you're gonna wake up to.

100
00:06:13,641 --> 00:06:14,693
It's him.

101
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,914
That's the man that killed my husband.

102
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,957
Stay with Mrs Garza.
The uniforms come with me!

103
00:06:30,272 --> 00:06:31,802
Emergency exit is that way.

104
00:06:34,257 --> 00:06:35,403
Gosh...

105
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,362
<i>We all taste just like chicken!</i>

106
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:56,110
That was different.

107
00:07:03,411 --> 00:07:04,453
It's you!

108
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:07,174
You okay?

109
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,475
I can't get caught again!

110
00:07:15,974 --> 00:07:17,373
Stop running now!

111
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,740
Hey, that's our guy, get him!

112
00:07:32,468 --> 00:07:34,731
- Spivak. <i>
- Mrs Garza IDed Hopper.</i>

113
00:07:35,153 --> 00:07:37,022
She did that last night, dude.

114
00:07:37,153 --> 00:07:40,077
No, she did it in person.
Hopper was here, at the club.

115
00:07:40,222 --> 00:07:42,599
- What he was doing there?
<i>- I didn't have time to ask.</i>

116
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:45,354
Look, he got away but we have
his truck so he's not going far.

117
00:07:45,473 --> 00:07:48,246
Get Mrs Garza down here.
I want her under protective custody.

118
00:07:48,283 --> 00:07:49,971
Do you think
Hopper wanted to get to her?

119
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:52,562
She's the only eye witness.
What do you think?

120
00:07:52,713 --> 00:07:54,910
Set a perimeter.
I get more uniforms down there.

121
00:07:54,966 --> 00:07:55,971
Already on it.

122
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,148
So is Shelten getting
his back waxed in there or what?

123
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:26,265
The sergeant will see you
when he's ready.

124
00:08:26,387 --> 00:08:28,437
Just saying I got a Vietnamese girl

125
00:08:28,438 --> 00:08:30,697
who can get him speed already
in under 20 minutes.

126
00:08:34,248 --> 00:08:35,248
What?

127
00:08:36,305 --> 00:08:38,182
You haven't eard yet, have you?

128
00:08:42,248 --> 00:08:43,281
Heard what?

129
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:45,098
About your partner...

130
00:08:45,924 --> 00:08:49,473
You know Hopper's wanted
for de Garza's murder, right?

131
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:52,075
What are you talking about?

132
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,666
What murder?

133
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:58,437
You got to get that?

134
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:10,584
Come on, come on.

135
00:09:13,033 --> 00:09:14,766
If they think by keeping me here
all day,

136
00:09:14,772 --> 00:09:16,543
that's gonna change my story,
they're wrong.

137
00:09:16,544 --> 00:09:19,431
I know it's rough. These guys
can't afford to make any mistakes.

138
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:22,764
- There was so many eyes watching.
- Brett was with me all night, Chad.

139
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:24,952
There's no way
he could have killed anyone.

140
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:26,073
I know...

141
00:09:27,182 --> 00:09:29,679
But I've heard
they have conflicting testimony.

142
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:31,868
What? From who?

143
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:43,406
- Who is that?
- This none of your damned business.

144
00:09:44,401 --> 00:09:46,824
- What's this?
- A search warrant.

145
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:48,683
For Ms Shelton apartment.

146
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:53,282
I don't care how sick this kid is!

147
00:09:53,357 --> 00:09:55,535
Fire him! Yes, today!

148
00:09:55,591 --> 00:09:57,479
Police business, I need this laptop.

149
00:10:00,145 --> 00:10:01,152
Sit down!

150
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:24,344
There you are...
Now let's see who you hang out with.

151
00:10:26,047 --> 00:10:27,070
Don't !

152
00:10:28,246 --> 00:10:30,980
Trust me, you don't wanna be found dead,
man.

153
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:41,600
How did you guys manage to find me
without your little tracking device ?

154
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,371
Let me guess, now we're gonna take

155
00:10:44,422 --> 00:10:46,371
a little trip to the quarry
to visit Detweiler.

156
00:10:46,418 --> 00:10:48,061
Oh aren't you the shady paddy?

157
00:10:48,922 --> 00:10:50,809
Don't even think about...

158
00:10:56,146 --> 00:10:57,923
Don't kill me! Please!

159
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:16,702
- Yeah?
- Hopper, where the hell are you?

160
00:11:16,703 --> 00:11:18,193
<i>Believe me, you don't wanna know.</i>

161
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:20,079
What if other people wanna know?

162
00:11:20,093 --> 00:11:22,540
Their hust saying you tried
to kill Ms Garza at some club...

163
00:11:22,568 --> 00:11:25,167
Well, that's not what happened.
I didn't even know she was there.

164
00:11:25,168 --> 00:11:28,558
I went looking for a list of suspects
of people who framed me, Andrea.

165
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:30,419
I don't know what you're talking about.

166
00:11:30,531 --> 00:11:33,057
But they have half the force out there
looking for you.

167
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,102
Word is, you killed
two ex-deputies.

168
00:11:37,092 --> 00:11:38,104
What?

169
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,045
You said they were two ex-cops?

170
00:11:40,216 --> 00:11:41,268
<i>Focus, Hopper!</i>

171
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:42,303
Tell me what happened.

172
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:44,289
They threatened me,
but I did not shoot them.

173
00:11:44,336 --> 00:11:45,444
Well, who the hell did?

174
00:11:45,445 --> 00:11:47,877
There was someone on the top
of the building on the roof top.

175
00:11:48,048 --> 00:11:50,262
So now you've got a garding angel
with a snipe rifle.

176
00:11:50,344 --> 00:11:51,509
<i>Do you hear yourself?</i>

177
00:11:51,522 --> 00:11:54,032
Did you call to give me a hard time
or to help me out?

178
00:11:55,185 --> 00:11:56,238
We need to talk.

179
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,832
You're making it very hard
to be your friend right now.

180
00:12:00,024 --> 00:12:01,062
Andrea?

181
00:12:07,401 --> 00:12:08,440
<i>Hey, this is Rita.</i>

182
00:12:08,768 --> 00:12:09,821
<i>Leave a message.</i>

183
00:12:11,365 --> 00:12:12,595
Just charged it...

184
00:12:16,049 --> 00:12:18,721
- I need to find my brother.
- Yeah, yeah, let's go.

185
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:20,443
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

186
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,766
Here you go.

187
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:24,153
Chad, I told you I'm not hungry.

188
00:12:24,154 --> 00:12:27,813
Come on, we could be here a while.
You got to keep your strength out.

189
00:12:30,929 --> 00:12:33,578
I did some asking around,
it turns out that's Garza's wife.

190
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:34,852
What?

191
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,367
- The guy...
- Yeah, the one Hopper whacked.

192
00:12:40,266 --> 00:12:41,278
Sorry.

193
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:43,867
Word is, she's homicide ace in the hall.

194
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,958
Says she saw Hopper do the deed.

195
00:12:45,986 --> 00:12:47,161
It's how they got the warrant

196
00:12:47,218 --> 00:12:49,068
- in the 1st place.
- That's not possible.

197
00:12:49,338 --> 00:12:51,142
Well, don't kill the messenger!

198
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,760
What are you doing? Rita! Hey, no!
That's a witness! No you can't!

199
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,508
Kill the lights.

200
00:13:19,195 --> 00:13:20,206
I got blood.

201
00:13:23,213 --> 00:13:25,627
Looks like somebody
forgot to go to the cleaners.

202
00:13:29,784 --> 00:13:32,600
- Get this to the SID. Put a rush on it.
- Right away, sir.

203
00:13:34,705 --> 00:13:35,757
What?

204
00:13:35,853 --> 00:13:37,670
- This doesn't fell right.
- How's that?

205
00:13:38,053 --> 00:13:40,787
A decorated cop decides
to kill a man he never met.

206
00:13:41,508 --> 00:13:43,079
And stashes the gun at his place

207
00:13:43,093 --> 00:13:46,865
and leaves a bloody shirt
right around his girlfriend's apartment?

208
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:49,633
Leave the room, guys.

209
00:13:55,807 --> 00:13:58,377
Don't ever question a case
in front of anyone else.

210
00:13:58,404 --> 00:14:00,892
When I see something hinky,
I'm not gonna keep quiet about it.

211
00:14:00,893 --> 00:14:01,905
Hopper's too smart

212
00:14:01,962 --> 00:14:04,450
- to do some this stupid...
- All killers make mistakes.

213
00:14:04,551 --> 00:14:07,024
Even the smart ones,
especially the smart ones.

214
00:14:07,038 --> 00:14:08,427
They all think they're not getting

215
00:14:08,502 --> 00:14:11,576
get caught but they always do.
So get used to it: Hopper's the guy...

216
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:14,829
- You have a problem?
- No...

217
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:15,922
No problem.

218
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:18,163
Just sounds like you wanna nail Hopper

219
00:14:18,238 --> 00:14:20,493
more than you wanna catch
Garza's killer.

220
00:14:42,301 --> 00:14:43,326
- Yeah?
- <i>Brett?</i>

221
00:14:44,379 --> 00:14:46,292
Rita. Thank God.

222
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:48,834
Are you OK? I've been so worried.

223
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:50,307
<i>Yeah, I know, I'm sorry.</i>

224
00:14:50,635 --> 00:14:53,656
Listen, now I know they're telling you
all sorts of things about me.

225
00:14:53,657 --> 00:14:56,215
They have an eyewitness, Brett.
The wife.

226
00:14:56,909 --> 00:14:58,002
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

227
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,575
- How do you know?
- I just know. She's lying.

228
00:15:02,086 --> 00:15:03,532
And what about the shirt?

229
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:06,687
- What shirt?
<i>- Your shirt.</i>

230
00:15:06,753 --> 00:15:09,860
The one they found in my apartment.
With blood on it.

231
00:15:10,414 --> 00:15:12,621
They're saying
it's a match to that man Garza.

232
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:13,884
Wait. That's...

233
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:16,194
That's never happened before...

234
00:15:16,504 --> 00:15:18,598
Maybe you should think about
turning yourself in.

235
00:15:18,692 --> 00:15:21,058
Wait.
Really, you don't think I did this?

236
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:22,739
<i>Baby.</i>

237
00:15:24,664 --> 00:15:27,161
Did somebody gets to you?
What's happening?

238
00:15:27,246 --> 00:15:28,786
Brett, we can get you helped.

239
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,705
I mean it's best for everyone.

240
00:15:31,006 --> 00:15:34,020
What do you mean? What are you talking
about,"we"? Who's "we"?

241
00:15:36,137 --> 00:15:37,292
Give yourself up, Hopper.

242
00:15:37,856 --> 00:15:40,184
It's the only chance you have right now.

243
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:45,377
- Yeah, I got to go.
- Brett, please.

244
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,337
DAY 2 (del vo)

245
00:16:08,643 --> 00:16:10,206
Did I say something wrong?

246
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:13,849
Are you even listening?

247
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:17,139
- Sorry, what?
- What is it with you, Brett?

248
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:20,327
You woke up and made conversation
to dump out a hamper.

249
00:16:20,413 --> 00:16:21,365
You wouldn't understand.

250
00:16:21,402 --> 00:16:23,782
How must I understand, Brett,
if you won't even talk to me?

251
00:16:23,829 --> 00:16:25,125
Because, I've told you already.

252
00:16:25,172 --> 00:16:26,561
- When?
- Yesterday.

253
00:16:26,824 --> 00:16:28,383
And the yesterday before that.

254
00:16:28,647 --> 00:16:30,375
And the yesterday before that.

255
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:32,204
It's not your fault, I just...

256
00:16:32,286 --> 00:16:34,436
- What are you talking about?
- I wish somebody

257
00:16:34,511 --> 00:16:38,802
would remember something, anything
that I told them, anything that I said.

258
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:46,152
In 20 seconds that phone is gonna ring
and it's gonna be Andrea.

259
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,354
She's gonna call and tell me
that she's taking Eddie

260
00:16:48,386 --> 00:16:49,960
to rehad because he started using again.

261
00:16:50,006 --> 00:16:52,997
Now, at first Eddie was killed,
but then I changed the day.

262
00:16:53,091 --> 00:16:54,265
Alright, so...

263
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,824
Right now,
honestly I'm just trying to...

264
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,987
- Are you okay?
- No, I definitly am not ok.

265
00:17:17,364 --> 00:17:18,387
Hey, Andrea.

266
00:17:20,012 --> 00:17:22,312
Yeah, he is here. Can he call you back?

267
00:17:28,963 --> 00:17:31,235
You're totaly freaking me out.

268
00:17:31,404 --> 00:17:33,507
- This is some kind of...
- I'm sorry, I really am.

269
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,841
I can't have this conversation today.

270
00:18:01,464 --> 00:18:02,487
I see you...

271
00:18:03,661 --> 00:18:04,919
What are you doing here?

272
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:06,966
You're not supposed to be in here.

273
00:18:07,905 --> 00:18:10,572
- Why the hell are you following me?
- I'm always here!

274
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:12,529
You're the new guy, I'm here every day.

275
00:18:12,604 --> 00:18:14,993
- "I'm here every day"?
- I mean today.

276
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:16,852
Only a different "today".

277
00:18:16,918 --> 00:18:19,736
- Look, I don't have time to explain.
- You know what? I think you do!

278
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:21,257
No way.

279
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:23,530
- You can never believe me. Nobody does.
- Try me.

280
00:18:23,624 --> 00:18:25,051
I don't even understand.

281
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,787
- Spit it out!
- It's always today!

282
00:18:27,862 --> 00:18:30,125
Over and over!
And I'm stuck in it, okay?

283
00:18:31,533 --> 00:18:32,585
There...

284
00:18:32,998 --> 00:18:34,031
You're happy?

285
00:18:38,762 --> 00:18:40,057
Say that again.

286
00:18:41,466 --> 00:18:42,799
I know how it sounds.

287
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:45,207
You're saying it's the same day

288
00:18:45,588 --> 00:18:46,912
that it's repeating?

289
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,532
Go ahead, laugh.

290
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:51,621
I've to get back to work.

291
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:55,932
Director dude's gonna show up
and there isn't much time.

292
00:18:56,007 --> 00:18:57,265
Do you recognize me?

293
00:18:58,598 --> 00:18:59,800
I don't know.

294
00:19:00,242 --> 00:19:02,148
- Should I?
- Come on, man.

295
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:04,669
It's important.

296
00:19:05,636 --> 00:19:07,195
Why? Why do you care?

297
00:19:09,542 --> 00:19:12,284
Because the same thing
is happening to me too.

298
00:19:16,795 --> 00:19:17,828
Very funny.

299
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:20,720
You make fun of the cripple kid.
You want my lunch money?

300
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:23,457
I'm not joking, you've seen me before,
haven't you?

301
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,429
At the police station.

302
00:19:27,865 --> 00:19:29,584
I tell them I'm looking for my brother.

303
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:31,898
But everyday, it's the same.

304
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:33,334
It's the same for me too.

305
00:19:33,616 --> 00:19:35,536
I wake up in the same place, same time

306
00:19:35,537 --> 00:19:38,259
same damn bird,
same damn Dodger game!

307
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:39,935
The Dodgers...

308
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:42,545
- Do they win?
- Yes.

309
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,761
They rally in the bottom of the neith.

310
00:19:44,991 --> 00:19:46,118
Finally!

311
00:19:50,311 --> 00:19:51,522
It's okay.

312
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,691
He is a very close friend
of mister Garza.

313
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,555
He just heard what happened, sorry man.

314
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:59,486
Of course,
I... just need to get my day planner.

315
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:01,576
Listen!
He just lost one of his best friends.

316
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:03,126
Just give us a minute, please!

317
00:20:03,536 --> 00:20:04,534
Of course.

318
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:09,928
Come on, we got to get out of here man,
too many cops around.

319
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:11,064
But I'm not finished!

320
00:20:11,102 --> 00:20:12,237
Finished with what?

321
00:20:13,098 --> 00:20:14,246
It's a membership list.

322
00:20:14,301 --> 00:20:17,062
The man who took my brother
belongs to this club.

323
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:18,549
So your brother's missing?

324
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,421
Not missing. They took him.

325
00:20:20,749 --> 00:20:24,002
But I've been coming here everyday,
trying to find the guy that did it.

326
00:20:24,193 --> 00:20:25,342
What's his name?

327
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:27,080
I don't know. I know what he looks like.

328
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:28,078
With glasses.

329
00:20:28,132 --> 00:20:31,139
So you just come here everyday
and hope he just shows up?

330
00:20:31,371 --> 00:20:33,572
No, I've got a plan, I'm not an idiot!

331
00:20:35,255 --> 00:20:38,126
I'm memorizing the membership list

332
00:20:38,508 --> 00:20:40,859
Names, addresses, the whole enchilada!

333
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:42,868
I'm already up to the end of this.

334
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:44,976
Here a better plan.

335
00:20:55,822 --> 00:20:58,623
- Mr. Summer?
- I know this is a delicate situation.

336
00:20:58,746 --> 00:21:00,669
And I'm pleased the club can
offer our members

337
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:02,377
a safe respite in their time of need.

338
00:21:02,378 --> 00:21:03,388
Your point.

339
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:05,847
We have an extremely demanding
membership.

340
00:21:06,146 --> 00:21:09,057
I cannot afford having one of your
detectives coming into my office.

341
00:21:10,588 --> 00:21:12,291
Our people are all here in this room.

342
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:14,533
I beg to differ. This...

343
00:21:15,139 --> 00:21:16,860
African American gentleman
just flashed me

344
00:21:16,944 --> 00:21:18,569
his badge and kicked me out!

345
00:21:18,774 --> 00:21:19,813
Show me.

346
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:31,591
This is Choi.
Keep a detail on Mrs. Garza

347
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,901
and lock down the building.

348
00:21:32,956 --> 00:21:34,624
How long has this been happening to you?

349
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:36,332
- What?
- The day. Repeating.

350
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:44,059
I didn't have this.

351
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,523
I don't know anymore.

352
00:21:50,903 --> 00:21:52,051
How about you?

353
00:21:52,707 --> 00:21:53,760
Three weeks.

354
00:21:54,142 --> 00:21:55,140
Three...

355
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:58,543
That's the... That's the magic number.

356
00:22:02,245 --> 00:22:03,926
Oh, you gotta be kidding me...

357
00:22:10,214 --> 00:22:13,713
Open every door, every closet,
every bathroom stall.

358
00:22:13,904 --> 00:22:14,912
Hey man...

359
00:22:16,815 --> 00:22:18,442
Dude, what did you do to me?

360
00:22:18,551 --> 00:22:20,260
Nothing. You blacked out.

361
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:22,287
I hate that.

362
00:22:22,861 --> 00:22:24,050
Happens a lot.

363
00:22:24,091 --> 00:22:25,471
That's freaky.

364
00:22:25,580 --> 00:22:28,533
I fall asleep one place
and wake up somewhere else.

365
00:22:29,133 --> 00:22:31,949
Especially after they sticked me
with that needle.

366
00:22:35,244 --> 00:22:36,578
They stick you with a needle?

367
00:22:36,887 --> 00:22:37,840
Yeah.

368
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,338
<i>Relax. Just a mild sedative.</i>

369
00:22:40,413 --> 00:22:42,985
- Did they take you to a quarry?
- No. Some kind of lab.

370
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:45,661
That's were they grabbed my brother.

371
00:22:45,934 --> 00:22:47,609
Since they though that I was asleep.

372
00:22:47,838 --> 00:22:50,315
But I heard Forasz
talking about this
fancy

373
00:22:50,345 --> 00:22:52,683
fancy schmaltzy club that he belongs to.

374
00:22:52,861 --> 00:22:55,894
And I... I've just got
the name onto my brain.

375
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:59,109
- The Santyana Club.
- Go back. Who's Forasz?

376
00:22:59,177 --> 00:23:03,224
That's how everybody called him.
The son of a bitch took my brother.

377
00:23:05,543 --> 00:23:07,852
I'm telling that there is
a conspiracy going on here.

378
00:23:07,965 --> 00:23:10,510
Detweiler, he is the one
who injected me.

379
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:13,735
He's only a middle mouse, man,
but I want the man on top.

380
00:23:14,331 --> 00:23:16,416
- That dude is a member here too.
- Yeah.

381
00:23:17,955 --> 00:23:20,424
You think that we're both looking
for the same guy?

382
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:22,753
If I'm right, his name is right here.

383
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:26,914
Give me the key of that door.

384
00:23:30,276 --> 00:23:31,374
This is so great.

385
00:23:31,375 --> 00:23:34,820
We can buy them together. We'd be like
Butch and Sundance, Bonnie and Clyde!

386
00:23:37,691 --> 00:23:40,180
Ok, it's just... nice not to be alone.

387
00:23:41,363 --> 00:23:42,583
Alright, come here.

388
00:23:43,259 --> 00:23:44,585
You gotta stay right here.

389
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:47,834
- What's your name?
- Hopper.

390
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:51,327
- Like the painter, that's cool.
- I'm Jared.

391
00:23:53,171 --> 00:23:55,819
Do you have any idea
why this is happening?

392
00:23:56,844 --> 00:23:59,060
No, and i don't know
how to make it stop.

393
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:01,539
How did you, like,

394
00:24:02,102 --> 00:24:03,145
handle it?

395
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,198
The only way I know how,

396
00:24:06,644 --> 00:24:07,681
be a cop.

397
00:24:14,049 --> 00:24:16,244
How do you manage
to do those things in pen?

398
00:24:16,453 --> 00:24:17,486
Practice I guess.

399
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:20,472
Help me out.
Do you know Conrad Detweiler?

400
00:24:21,636 --> 00:24:23,197
Sorry. I can't help you.

401
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,178
I'm more interested
in who he hangs with.

402
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:26,990
It's important.

403
00:24:30,605 --> 00:24:31,724
Maybe...

404
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,231
you can help me with something, though.

405
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,151
73 across.

406
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:51,172
Sir. I wouldn't.

407
00:24:53,881 --> 00:24:55,711
The emergency exit is that way.

408
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:08,461
Get in man, get in.

409
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:13,379
M. Colburn, Detective Brett Hopper.

410
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:15,463
We have a mutual acquaintance.

411
00:25:15,584 --> 00:25:16,591
Nathan Baxter.

412
00:25:17,131 --> 00:25:18,126
Go.

413
00:25:19,073 --> 00:25:20,078
Hey, drive !

414
00:25:24,185 --> 00:25:26,415
You're the one the cops are after
for the Garza murder.

415
00:25:26,905 --> 00:25:28,151
How do you know that ?

416
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:30,074
Small club, word gets around...

417
00:25:30,089 --> 00:25:32,095
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

418
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:34,274
Actually I'm being framed
by members of your club.

419
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:37,143
It's a very serious charge.

420
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,270
That's why I need a good lawyer
to help me prove it.

421
00:25:39,332 --> 00:25:41,275
Come on. You didn't jump in my car

422
00:25:41,304 --> 00:25:42,799
to hire me as your defense attorney.

423
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,998
You got in because you need
a quick get away

424
00:25:45,074 --> 00:25:48,335
My retainers starts at $30000

425
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:51,132
How is an honest cops supposed
to come up with cash like that?

426
00:25:51,286 --> 00:25:52,329
You're right.

427
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:53,923
Gimme a dollar.

428
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:02,621
You are now protected
on the attorney-client privilege.

429
00:26:03,737 --> 00:26:04,899
What about your fee?

430
00:26:05,003 --> 00:26:07,748
I can make ten times that
on the book deal.

431
00:26:07,893 --> 00:26:09,136
Let's go to my office.

432
00:26:10,552 --> 00:26:12,848
So you telling me you were
with Hopper all night.

433
00:26:12,849 --> 00:26:15,279
He went to bed with me,
he woke up next me.

434
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,852
I don't know how to be any clearer.

435
00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:19,030
I appreciate that
and I wanna believe you, really.

436
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:20,039
You know...

437
00:26:20,764 --> 00:26:23,465
When I ran your drivers licence, some

438
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:25,295
interesting information came up.

439
00:26:25,982 --> 00:26:28,474
- That's not relevent.
- I was hoping you might have learned

440
00:26:28,493 --> 00:26:30,379
a few things since 2002
like telling the truth.

441
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,127
I said she's done talking to you.

442
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:36,133
This is a homicide investigation.

443
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:39,178
Unless You want her booked
as an accessory.

444
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:40,437
She stays.

445
00:26:45,958 --> 00:26:47,080
Come on.

446
00:26:55,525 --> 00:26:57,675
I thought that went away.
How would he know that?

447
00:26:57,705 --> 00:27:00,773
They're just bluffing.
Don't worry about it, I took care of it.

448
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,068
This is Jared Pryor.

449
00:27:04,531 --> 00:27:06,493
He claims he was with Hopper
this morning.

450
00:27:06,494 --> 00:27:09,080
Yeah, but we can't talk about it...

451
00:27:09,081 --> 00:27:11,031
It's him and me are the same.

452
00:27:11,163 --> 00:27:13,313
- The same ?
- You know, peas in a pod.

453
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:15,419
Flies in the ointment.

454
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,445
Can you tell us why you
and Detective Hopper

455
00:27:17,446 --> 00:27:18,939
were at the Santayana club ?

456
00:27:19,087 --> 00:27:20,088
I...

457
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,555
...can't really say.

458
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:26,080
But if you know who Detweiler,
working for, let me know.

459
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,750
Detweiler?

460
00:27:32,465 --> 00:27:35,170
- Who's that ?
- Do you know where Hopper is now ?

461
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:36,864
Sure.

462
00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:39,130
He's looking for the man
who's making
it today

463
00:27:39,131 --> 00:27:41,533
over and over again! We both are!

464
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,882
Yeah, well...

465
00:27:46,847 --> 00:27:47,966
Good luck with that.

466
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:57,874
Now as my lawyer, you have full access
to the evidence against me, right ?

467
00:27:57,996 --> 00:27:59,606
Well, we're get into that.

468
00:27:59,724 --> 00:28:01,987
But first, there are a few ground rules.

469
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:04,681
Don't talk to anyone about the case.

470
00:28:04,761 --> 00:28:06,723
No wives, girlfriends,

471
00:28:06,817 --> 00:28:09,493
that could make them
potential witnesses in a trial.

472
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:11,672
And don't talk to the press
about anything.

473
00:28:12,526 --> 00:28:13,878
Do you have a publicist?

474
00:28:15,581 --> 00:28:17,760
All right,
I could recommend one for you.

475
00:28:17,948 --> 00:28:20,276
This case is gonna be
trialed in the media...

476
00:28:20,361 --> 00:28:22,952
<i>Hopper shouldn't have receive
the package yet, it's important.</i>

477
00:28:23,018 --> 00:28:25,985
<i>This hourglass
was found next to a dead body.</i>

478
00:28:29,783 --> 00:28:31,999
Now you got 3 minutes, start talking.

479
00:28:38,273 --> 00:28:39,695
Tell me about this hourglass.

480
00:28:39,761 --> 00:28:42,987
- It's from the club. What does that...
- Shut up! I'm asking the questions.

481
00:28:43,053 --> 00:28:45,531
- Who else has one?
- Everyone on the board.

482
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:48,658
- What board?
- I can't tell you if I can't breathe.

483
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:58,481
The Santayana board of directors.

484
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,127
Every member of the board

485
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:03,244
past and present, gets an hourglass
when they're voted in.

486
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:04,944
Kind of an inside joke.

487
00:29:05,038 --> 00:29:07,169
Keep them from
talking too long at meetings.

488
00:29:08,014 --> 00:29:11,593
Would you mind telling me what is
so important about a damn hourglass?

489
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,898
It's the second one
I've seen just like it.

490
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:17,034
- The 1st was sent to me by Garza.
- But you said you didn't know him.

491
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:18,752
I never event met the guy.

492
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:21,297
I don't know why he sent it.

493
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:24,472
But it's evidence
in a 15 year old murder case.

494
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:28,106
Isabella Contreras.
I think she worked at your club

495
00:29:28,275 --> 00:29:29,853
and was killed by one of your members.

496
00:29:29,994 --> 00:29:32,218
What has an old murder case
have to do with Garza?

497
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,274
I don't know but
it's all connected to this club.

498
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:37,082
That's why you saw me there,
I was after this.

499
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,486
- A list of members.
- And you suspect them, don't you?

500
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:43,589
Yeah, one or more
of these men is a killer.

501
00:29:43,898 --> 00:29:47,137
If you're right,
and I hardly doubt that you are,

502
00:29:47,513 --> 00:29:49,528
you've narrowed it down
to the 400 of the richest

503
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:51,663
most powerful people in the city.

504
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:54,447
How many of them are on the board
of the directors? A couple dozen?

505
00:29:54,532 --> 00:29:56,156
Yes, sounds right.

506
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,339
- Who are they?
- You really want to know?

507
00:30:01,126 --> 00:30:02,526
All right.

508
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:05,560
Here Robert Diminico.
He's the deputy mayor.

509
00:30:05,635 --> 00:30:07,592
Winston Wales, philantropist.

510
00:30:07,638 --> 00:30:10,040
Giselle Mack
runs the city art's foundation.

511
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:11,310
Seth Bath.

512
00:30:11,431 --> 00:30:12,836
Alex Forasz.

513
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,979
Here's your friend Garza.

514
00:30:14,006 --> 00:30:15,021
Wait. Go back.

515
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,226
Forasz...

516
00:30:19,287 --> 00:30:21,200
<i>I heard Forasz talking about this...</i>

517
00:30:21,201 --> 00:30:23,524
<i>this fancy schmaltzy club
that he belongs to.</i>

518
00:30:26,102 --> 00:30:27,127
Look, detective...

519
00:30:27,537 --> 00:30:30,134
The DA is gonna be pushing hard
on this one!

520
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,155
Why don't you just let me push back?

521
00:30:32,361 --> 00:30:35,100
I'll make some calls,
see how strong that case is.

522
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:36,217
But...

523
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,815
Next time...

524
00:30:38,308 --> 00:30:39,306
No choking...

525
00:30:39,952 --> 00:30:40,953
Yeah.

526
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:49,952
- Hopper!
- Hey, Andrea. I need you to run a check

527
00:30:50,007 --> 00:30:52,045
on an Alexander Forasz.

528
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:54,634
<i>See if he has a jacket.
- Hopper, what is going on?</i>

529
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,630
There's a board out on you.
Robbery, homicides.

530
00:30:56,631 --> 00:30:58,981
I know. I killed Garza
and went after his wife,

531
00:30:59,008 --> 00:31:00,429
and I did a bunch of bad stuff.

532
00:31:01,523 --> 00:31:03,628
How can you be so damn flip about this?

533
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,558
Because I don't have the time.
you always end up helping me in the end,

534
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,162
so could we just skip to that, please ?

535
00:31:08,163 --> 00:31:10,170
I always help you?
What am I, your secretary?

536
00:31:10,224 --> 00:31:12,247
No, you're my partner.

537
00:31:16,687 --> 00:31:18,345
All right, you have to give me a second,

538
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:20,269
this hasn't exactly been my easiest day.

539
00:31:20,304 --> 00:31:21,801
Yeah, well, you and me both.

540
00:31:23,161 --> 00:31:24,747
- What was that name again?
<i>- Forasz.</i>

541
00:31:24,965 --> 00:31:27,803
F-O-R-A-S-Z.

542
00:31:27,988 --> 00:31:29,409
<i>Alexander Forasz.</i>

543
00:31:33,776 --> 00:31:35,033
Okay, I've got a hit.

544
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,158
But he's clean.
Not even a parking ticket.

545
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,340
What's the hit?

546
00:31:38,873 --> 00:31:42,713
He filed a restraining order against
some guy named Jared Pryor.

547
00:31:44,668 --> 00:31:45,679
<i>I'm Jared.</i>

548
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:46,969
Is this helping?

549
00:31:47,523 --> 00:31:49,452
Yeah. Do you have an adress for Forasz?

550
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,309
I did some asking around,
it turns out that's Garza's wife.

551
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:02,427
What are you doing?

552
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:03,832
You can't just...

553
00:32:03,873 --> 00:32:05,800
That's a witness! You can't just...
Rita!

554
00:32:16,829 --> 00:32:17,835
Thank you.

555
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:22,269
I know you're in a lot of pain
and I'm...

556
00:32:22,487 --> 00:32:23,585
I'm so sorry.

557
00:32:24,593 --> 00:32:26,085
But you're wrong about him.

558
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:27,983
What?

559
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:32,215
Brett Hopper couldn't have killed
your husband. He was with me all night.

560
00:32:34,177 --> 00:32:35,243
Who are you?

561
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:38,175
I'm his girlfriend.

562
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,045
Alberto was my husband.

563
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,624
We were married for twenty-two years.

564
00:32:46,342 --> 00:32:49,202
- I'm so sorry.
- I heard his name first.

565
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:51,444
Your boyfriend.

566
00:32:52,579 --> 00:32:53,851
Alberto said it...

567
00:32:54,193 --> 00:32:55,204
Hopper.

568
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,150
Clear as I am saying it to you.

569
00:32:57,738 --> 00:32:58,614
And then I heard...

570
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,488
I came downstairs but he was...

571
00:33:03,788 --> 00:33:05,743
Alberto was liying there.

572
00:33:07,109 --> 00:33:08,217
I saw him.

573
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:11,455
Standing over my husband, with a gun.

574
00:33:14,718 --> 00:33:16,691
I saw his face.

575
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,069
<i>Detective Hopper?</i>

576
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,321
<i>Barry Coldburn.</i>

577
00:33:39,348 --> 00:33:40,361
We've got problems.

578
00:33:40,605 --> 00:33:43,285
Can you be a little more specific
or is that on my dollar bills?

579
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:44,394
<i>Well, to begin,</i>

580
00:33:44,933 --> 00:33:47,083
they've got the murder weapon
with your prints,

581
00:33:47,243 --> 00:33:49,246
your shirt, with Garza's blood on it,

582
00:33:49,588 --> 00:33:52,167
<i>not to mention the eyewitness,
Garza's wife.</i>

583
00:33:52,168 --> 00:33:53,898
- She's lying.
<i>- It doesn't matter.</i>

584
00:33:53,921 --> 00:33:56,340
The prosecution puts
the grieving widow on the stand,

585
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:58,862
you might as well start
planning the menu for your last meal.

586
00:33:58,891 --> 00:34:02,562
Look, the cops are in on this,
on all levels. Witnesses lie,

587
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:03,931
lab results get doctored.

588
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:06,695
If you're saying to me
an entire system is against you,

589
00:34:06,736 --> 00:34:08,811
that this is one big conspiracy,

590
00:34:08,825 --> 00:34:11,757
let me warn you,
juries don't take kindly to the C word.

591
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,738
- I know how this sounds.
<i>- Do you?</i>

592
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:16,321
If you're laying pipe
for an insanity defense...

593
00:34:16,335 --> 00:34:19,072
That's not what this is.
I'm being framed.

594
00:34:19,144 --> 00:34:22,457
Yeah, maybe... but as your attorney,
I have to advise you.

595
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,319
The evidence against you is...

596
00:34:25,045 --> 00:34:26,728
extremely compelling.

597
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:29,016
<i>If you want my best advise, take a plea.</i>

598
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:31,230
I can probably get you murder II.

599
00:34:31,251 --> 00:34:34,581
<i>That's fifteen to life,
but no chances of the death penalty</i>

600
00:35:04,367 --> 00:35:06,664
So, thanks. Thanks for helping me out.

601
00:35:07,276 --> 00:35:09,151
I have to be really careful.

602
00:35:09,247 --> 00:35:10,314
Sorry, man.

603
00:35:20,308 --> 00:35:21,648
Okay, I confess!

604
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:23,411
I killed Alberto Garza.

605
00:35:23,479 --> 00:35:25,610
- Alright?
- No, you didn't, you idiot!

606
00:35:33,901 --> 00:35:35,035
Where is Detweiler?

607
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,586
On the swing set?

608
00:35:36,853 --> 00:35:38,555
You've been playing in the wrong park!

609
00:35:39,896 --> 00:35:42,360
I know he's answered to somebody
at the club, is that you?

610
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:44,641
Forget about the Santayana Club.

611
00:35:44,709 --> 00:35:46,280
You won't get any answers there.

612
00:35:47,565 --> 00:35:48,891
But where am I supposed to look?

613
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:50,497
A little closer to home.

614
00:35:51,528 --> 00:35:52,498
Thanks, that's helpful!

615
00:35:52,773 --> 00:35:55,311
Your old man was on the right track
with the girl.

616
00:35:56,712 --> 00:35:57,711
My old man?

617
00:35:58,307 --> 00:35:59,481
What are you talking about ?

618
00:35:59,563 --> 00:36:00,646
Here, smart guy...

619
00:36:02,218 --> 00:36:03,243
Figure it out!

620
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:09,056
For the zip ties.

621
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:11,310
Who are you, guys?

622
00:36:12,704 --> 00:36:14,126
Think of us as...

623
00:36:14,563 --> 00:36:15,793
friends of your father.

624
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:22,909
DAY 3 (del vo)

625
00:36:31,718 --> 00:36:33,140
Somebody's tense.

626
00:36:34,957 --> 00:36:36,010
What's wrong?

627
00:36:36,313 --> 00:36:37,325
Nothing.

628
00:36:39,074 --> 00:36:40,389
We went to bed last night,

629
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:42,270
and everything was fine.
What happened?

630
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:44,582
Did you have a nightmare or something?

631
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:48,464
The worst ever.

632
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,141
That's okay.

633
00:36:54,317 --> 00:36:55,397
It's just a dream.

634
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:10,365
Yeah, Jen, it's me, we need to talk.

635
00:37:10,474 --> 00:37:12,128
It's... about Dad.

636
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:14,950
I'm wondering if you have any
of his old stuff?

637
00:37:15,032 --> 00:37:16,747
I'll call you back later today.

638
00:37:24,328 --> 00:37:25,339
Jared!

639
00:37:29,393 --> 00:37:30,664
Get in, man. Get in.

640
00:37:40,611 --> 00:37:41,527
Why are we here?

641
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,206
Do you know a man named
Alexander Forasz?

642
00:37:44,985 --> 00:37:45,996
Yeah.

643
00:37:46,942 --> 00:37:48,220
Maybe. I...

644
00:37:48,514 --> 00:37:50,180
I think so. I am not sure.

645
00:37:50,194 --> 00:37:51,998
He took a restraining order
out against you.

646
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,191
Yeah, well, that's because
I almost caught him.

647
00:37:55,615 --> 00:37:56,776
But he got away!

648
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:00,807
You think he's the one
who took my brother?

649
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:02,330
The one that we're looking for?

650
00:38:03,054 --> 00:38:04,339
That's the reason we're here.

651
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:05,542
Come on.

652
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:08,465
I can't do this.

653
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:12,128
Could you just...
You know, while I stay here?

654
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,239
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

655
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:16,783
Alright.

656
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,250
<i>Yes?</i>

657
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:26,462
LAPD. I'd like to as some questions
about a Jared Pryor.

658
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:29,011
<i>You know, I have
a restraining order against him.</i>

659
00:38:29,024 --> 00:38:30,159
Yes, that's why I'm here.

660
00:38:30,247 --> 00:38:31,504
Please, sir, it's important.

661
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:46,616
Would you like some coffee, detective...

662
00:38:46,689 --> 00:38:47,742
Hopper.

663
00:38:48,412 --> 00:38:49,815
I thought you might know that.

664
00:38:51,756 --> 00:38:53,427
How do you know Jared Pryor?

665
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:55,118
It's complicated.

666
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,660
I'm sure it is.
Did Detweiler introduce you?

667
00:38:57,964 --> 00:39:00,046
- Who?
- Did you meet to the Santayana Club?

668
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,127
A club?

669
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:04,598
- How do you know I belong to the club?
- What did you do to Jared?

670
00:39:04,764 --> 00:39:06,655
- What did you do with his brother?
- Nothing!

671
00:39:06,656 --> 00:39:08,821
- Who the hell are you?
- I was his surgeon!

672
00:39:09,704 --> 00:39:10,759
His surgeon?

673
00:39:12,127 --> 00:39:13,160
Jared was...

674
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:16,600
He was a successful bond trader

675
00:39:16,675 --> 00:39:18,666
for one of the largest firm
in the whole world,

676
00:39:18,683 --> 00:39:20,493
until his seizures
just got out of control.

677
00:39:20,494 --> 00:39:21,519
Seizures?

678
00:39:21,997 --> 00:39:24,211
- From what?
- Temporal lobe epilepsy.

679
00:39:24,252 --> 00:39:26,248
Jared had one of the worst cases
we'd ever seen.

680
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:28,578
It got so drastic
he just couldn't function.

681
00:39:28,606 --> 00:39:30,136
We had to perform surgery.

682
00:39:30,875 --> 00:39:32,173
Like in brain surgery?

683
00:39:32,228 --> 00:39:33,963
Yes, sir. We saved his life.

684
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:35,979
But there were side effects.

685
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,116
Hallucinations, black-outs,

686
00:39:38,117 --> 00:39:41,240
even sufferance from
hyperactive episodes of <i>déja-vu</i>

687
00:39:46,178 --> 00:39:47,168
"Déja-vu"?

688
00:39:47,553 --> 00:39:50,137
It's that feeling that you're
reliving a moment over and over.

689
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:51,866
Yeah. I think I've heard of it.

690
00:39:51,995 --> 00:39:54,853
Jared will have
multiples episodes of this every day.

691
00:39:54,907 --> 00:39:57,526
So he latches on to what's familiar.

692
00:39:57,990 --> 00:39:59,656
He'll repeat routines,

693
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:02,336
he'll go
to the same place
day after day. He will have...

694
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,010
sudden bursts of memory.

695
00:40:05,143 --> 00:40:07,443
That's there is just so much
about the brain that...

696
00:40:07,618 --> 00:40:08,889
we don't understand.

697
00:40:08,946 --> 00:40:10,595
Like the memory of his brother.

698
00:40:10,711 --> 00:40:13,356
- What happen to his brother?
- Well, he died.

699
00:40:13,751 --> 00:40:16,870
Cancer more than a year ago, but see,
Jared doesn't remember.

700
00:40:16,955 --> 00:40:18,865
As far as he's concerned,
his brother was alive

701
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:21,509
when he went into surgery
and gone when he woke up, so...

702
00:40:23,624 --> 00:40:24,826
In a sens, yeah...

703
00:40:26,131 --> 00:40:27,239
I'm responsible.

704
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:30,591
I took the memory of his brother
away from him and

705
00:40:30,703 --> 00:40:32,389
that's why he comes after me.

706
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,539
He actually believes that

707
00:40:34,905 --> 00:40:37,553
he is a victim of some sort
of grand conspiracy and

708
00:40:37,658 --> 00:40:39,677
that I'm, some kind of lean leader.

709
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:47,628
How would somebody know
if they had this...

710
00:40:48,915 --> 00:40:49,957
condition?

711
00:40:50,041 --> 00:40:51,525
Other than the seizures? They...

712
00:40:52,107 --> 00:40:53,534
They probably wouldn't but...

713
00:41:04,579 --> 00:41:05,677
So?

714
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:08,705
He's not who I thought he was.

715
00:41:09,391 --> 00:41:11,841
He want's to talk to you though.
He'll tell you everything.

716
00:41:12,306 --> 00:41:13,818
Did you find my brother?

717
00:41:15,913 --> 00:41:17,979
No, but Forasz said he'll...

718
00:41:18,129 --> 00:41:19,594
He'll tell you where he is.

719
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,947
Thank you.

720
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:32,876
For what?

721
00:41:32,914 --> 00:41:35,059
You're the first person
that believe in me.

722
00:41:35,676 --> 00:41:38,286
The first one that really understood.

723
00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:43,668
I've been alone, for so long.

724
00:41:59,727 --> 00:42:01,532
Anyway, I owe you an apology.

725
00:42:01,607 --> 00:42:03,917
I shouldn't have treated you
the way that I did.

726
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,227
Don't worry about it.

727
00:42:06,696 --> 00:42:07,757
We're good.

728
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:11,152
Still, I'm sorry I bit you.
