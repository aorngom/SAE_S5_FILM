00:00:11,257 --> 00:00:13,349
<i>My name is detective Brett Hopper,</i>

3
00:00:14,069 --> 00:00:16,406
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

4
00:00:16,879 --> 00:00:17,857
Freeze!

5
00:00:17,922 --> 00:00:20,870
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

6
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,775
<i>I will be framed for murder...</i>

7
00:00:23,096 --> 00:00:24,766
Who the hell are you people?

8
00:00:25,385 --> 00:00:27,675
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

9
00:00:27,901 --> 00:00:30,587
<i>I know all this because
I am living the same day...</i>

10
00:00:31,328 --> 00:00:32,980
<i>over and over again.</i>

11
00:00:33,036 --> 00:00:35,600
The day is the same,
but different things happen.

12
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:38,200
<i>Every decision I make
has a consequence.</i>

13
00:00:39,153 --> 00:00:42,200
<i>I could save a stranger's life...
or not.</i>

14
00:00:42,279 --> 00:00:43,536
I didn't go for coffee.

15
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,267
<i>I could try to run... or hide.</i>

16
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:51,644
<i>But the next morning,
I feel the pain of the day before.</i>

17
00:00:52,588 --> 00:00:54,456
<i>Every day I get another chance.</i>

18
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,499
This mess you're in...
have anything to do

19
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:57,826
with the fact you been looking

20
00:00:57,873 --> 00:01:00,073
- into the Latin disciples?
- We flipped Damien Ortiz

21
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:02,009
against the disciples,
now he's on the run.

22
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:04,331
<i>Every day, I get another clue.</i>

23
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:06,702
<i>Hopper, you should've received
a package today.</i>

24
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:10,200
<i>It's important.
Today, I have to get that package.</i>

25
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:54,387
- Good morning.
- Morning.

26
00:02:04,016 --> 00:02:05,800
<i>...due to an overturned semi.</i>

27
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:09,000
<i>it spilled over a hundred cases
of diapers.</i>

28
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:21,299
Are you okay?

29
00:02:21,482 --> 00:02:22,702
Yeah, I'm fine.

30
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,534
<i>...right around there,
due to the rubbernecking.</i>

31
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:32,646
What are you doing?

32
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:34,900
- Just a sec.
- Brett.

33
00:02:35,492 --> 00:02:36,786
I'm just gonna take a shower.

34
00:02:37,068 --> 00:02:40,900
- Me, too. I'll scrub your back.
- Sounds great, baby.

35
00:02:41,988 --> 00:02:43,400
Will you just let me in? Come on.

36
00:02:43,885 --> 00:02:45,500
Come on. Come on. Open up.

37
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:47,761
What?

38
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:51,818
I thought we were gonna take
a shower together.

39
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:53,882
I was... We were, but I was thinking

40
00:02:53,967 --> 00:02:56,007
maybe I would take the day off today.

41
00:02:57,073 --> 00:02:59,178
Really? You never take the day off.

42
00:02:59,253 --> 00:03:02,067
Yeah, well, I thought maybe we could...
We could hang out.

43
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:04,378
Baby, I gotta work.

44
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:06,274
Well, you could take the day off, too.

45
00:03:06,424 --> 00:03:07,484
I can't do that.

46
00:03:07,747 --> 00:03:09,300
Come on, come on. It'll be fun.

47
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,267
Come...

48
00:03:20,723 --> 00:03:21,746
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,300
- It's okay.
- No. It's not okay.

50
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,000
I know that your mother
gave this to you.

51
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay. I'm gonna make this up
to you. I promise.

52
00:03:31,107 --> 00:03:32,700
We can go anywhere you wanna go today.

53
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,849
Anywhere.

54
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:37,039
Okay.

55
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,300
Okay?

56
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,365
I'm just gonna drop by my place

57
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,373
and pick up a package,
and we'll be good.

58
00:03:45,495 --> 00:03:46,500
Let's go.

59
00:03:56,763 --> 00:03:57,900
You said anywhere, right?

60
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:00,365
Yep. Yep.

61
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:03,747
- Okay. Mexico.
- Mex...

62
00:04:03,954 --> 00:04:06,265
- What?
- Let's go down to Rosarito beach.

63
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,700
I know this great lobster shack
right off the highway.

64
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,300
Six beers for a buck.

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,190
Okay. Sure. Sounds great.

66
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,800
<i>Miss... you dropped this.</i>

67
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:37,168
You want some coffee?

68
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:39,583
Yeah.

69
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,038
- ...the most incredible by far.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

70
00:04:44,523 --> 00:04:46,371
- L.A.P.D.
- Hold on.

71
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:48,837
- What's the problem?
- Can I see some I.D, please?

72
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:51,052
- What for?
- Just a police investigation.

73
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:53,186
We're questioning potential witnesses.

74
00:04:53,374 --> 00:04:56,133
I didn't see anything. And I have
a super important morning meeting.

75
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,680
- I'll get a coffee...
- He'll be OK.

76
00:04:57,681 --> 00:04:58,856
Could I please see your I.D?

77
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:06,538
Hello?

78
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,974
Wait. Just calm down. What's wrong?

79
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,700
Look, I can't.

80
00:05:12,793 --> 00:05:14,200
Not today. Not now.

81
00:05:16,738 --> 00:05:18,799
Just... please just stop calling me.

82
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,414
I just... I can't. I'm sorry.

83
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:22,328
I just... I can't.

84
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:28,700
Okay. And this judge, Nitzberg...

85
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,829
- But, he's your supervisor.
- Look,

86
00:05:31,073 --> 00:05:34,621
I've given you my address,
my cell phone. What more do you want?

87
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:37,800
Thank you. That'll be all, ma'am.

88
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,700
My car! My car!

89
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:44,800
- Where you going?
- To the bus. I'm gonna go help 'em.

90
00:05:44,983 --> 00:05:46,865
- Rita...
- Call 911, okay?

91
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:49,590
- Wait. We had plans.
- Okay, I'm sorry, honey.

92
00:05:49,637 --> 00:05:51,239
We're gonna have to escape another day.

93
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:53,473
Okay, but wait. We don't have to cancel.

94
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:55,545
The E.M.T.S are gonna come.
They'll take over.

95
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,965
Brett, what is going on?

96
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:59,968
- Nothing.
- Nothing? First you take the day off,

97
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:01,542
Then you don't want me to go to work.

98
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,699
Now you want me to leave
a major accident scene?

99
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,893
You are acting really strange.

100
00:06:06,006 --> 00:06:07,507
What has gotten into you?

101
00:06:07,647 --> 00:06:09,920
<i>They played some voice mail...
A woman talking about</i>

102
00:06:09,939 --> 00:06:11,191
<i>some package they sent to you.</i>

103
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:12,789
<i>They think it's tied to Garza.</i>

104
00:06:13,801 --> 00:06:17,007
I'm gonna go help those people,
and then I'm going to the hospital.

105
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,040
Okay, but stay there. Don't leave.

106
00:06:20,368 --> 00:06:23,783
Okay? I'm gonna meet you
after I go to my place.

107
00:06:23,924 --> 00:06:25,400
Don't leave the hospital!

108
00:06:59,126 --> 00:07:00,800
- Mr. Hopper.
- Mr. Zeitoun.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,500
- I need to speak to you.
- I know. The dog's been barking.

110
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,700
There's a leak upstairs,
a plumber came, right?

111
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,583
Yes, that's... Yes.

112
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:09,334
Sorry for the inconvenience.

113
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,300
What is this, a joke?

114
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,580
You think this is funny?

115
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:43,300
Is he talking to us?

116
00:07:43,344 --> 00:07:44,765
Nah. No way he made us.

117
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,214
Is this what you want?

118
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:48,606
Come and get it!

119
00:07:48,728 --> 00:07:50,506
- No, he's definitely talking to us.
- Yep.

120
00:08:03,413 --> 00:08:04,748
Let's start two large-Bore I.V.S,

121
00:08:04,804 --> 00:08:06,135
- normal saline.
- Wide open.

122
00:08:06,174 --> 00:08:07,400
And I want you to page Dr. Kim.

123
00:08:07,426 --> 00:08:09,294
I think she might have tension.

124
00:08:10,404 --> 00:08:11,600
Rita, you've got a visitor.

125
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:15,001
- Chad.
- You changed your hair.

126
00:08:15,386 --> 00:08:17,301
- Six months ago.
- It looks nice.

127
00:08:17,404 --> 00:08:19,213
But I liked it
when you had the other thing.

128
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:20,903
I'm working. What are you doing here?

129
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,905
Can't a guy stop by
check on his ex-wife?

130
00:08:25,388 --> 00:08:27,677
Well, then I'll cut right to it.
You seen Hopper lately?

131
00:08:27,753 --> 00:08:29,156
How's that any of your business?

132
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:31,454
It became my business
when your boyfriend

133
00:08:31,455 --> 00:08:32,688
murdered Alberto Garza.

134
00:08:33,621 --> 00:08:34,728
What are you talking about?

135
00:08:34,934 --> 00:08:36,500
Assistant D.A. got hit last night.

136
00:08:36,732 --> 00:08:38,346
Hopper's the prime suspect.

137
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,626
There's a warrant out for his arrest.

138
00:08:40,832 --> 00:08:42,584
There must be some mistake.

139
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:44,950
Yeah, kinda hard to believe,
you think you know someone

140
00:08:44,951 --> 00:08:46,578
and then they go and do something crazy.

141
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:48,188
Brett didn't kill anyone.

142
00:08:48,803 --> 00:08:49,554
I hear different.

143
00:08:51,101 --> 00:08:52,500
Sorry to be the one to tell you.

144
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:54,042
Hopper's in real trouble.

145
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,302
A couple of guys downtown
wanna talk to you about it.

146
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:00,015
Look, you don't have to go,

147
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,826
but it might be helpful.

148
00:09:02,426 --> 00:09:03,700
For Hopper's sake.

149
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:08,881
- Hiya, Hopper.
- I know this is a reach for you,

150
00:09:08,938 --> 00:09:12,200
But don't do anything stupid.
Rita, we need to leave.

151
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,760
Yeah, good plan!
She's gonna go on the run with

152
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:16,507
- a fugitive.
- You gotta come with me,

153
00:09:16,526 --> 00:09:18,066
it's the only way I can protect you.

154
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:20,000
The only one
she needs protection from is you.

155
00:09:20,038 --> 00:09:21,342
Hey, sweetheart, call 9-1-1.

156
00:09:21,343 --> 00:09:24,324
- I got a guy with a gun in my back.
- Whatever he says, I didn't do it.

157
00:09:24,325 --> 00:09:26,943
I didn't kill Garza.
You gotta believe me.

158
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:28,388
Brett, just put the gun down.

159
00:09:29,658 --> 00:09:30,746
Listen to her, Hopper.

160
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,472
- Hole's getting deeper.
- Shut up!

161
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:34,700
Honey, listen, I know this looks crazy.

162
00:09:34,804 --> 00:09:37,140
I know I don't have the right
to ask you this, but I am.

163
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:39,485
You gotta come with me.
I'll explain everything later.

164
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:40,523
Please,

165
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:42,237
now come with me.

166
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:45,321
Brett...

167
00:09:47,432 --> 00:09:49,244
That was real sweet,
but you're under arrest.

168
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:50,280
I have to take you in.

169
00:09:51,457 --> 00:09:52,500
Not today.

170
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
Whiskey sour.

171
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,718
A little early for that,
don't you think?

172
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:26,255
- Hopper, what are you doing here?
- I'm here looking for you.

173
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:28,976
- They say you killed...
- Garza. Yeah, I know.

174
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:31,868
I also know that they offered you
a deal to flip on me

175
00:10:31,981 --> 00:10:34,711
in exchange for amnesty
on your I.A. Investigation.

176
00:10:36,882 --> 00:10:37,999
I never agreed to...

177
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,431
Hell, how did you know...

178
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:44,627
Just hear me out, all right?
That's all I'm asking.

179
00:10:47,473 --> 00:10:48,627
<i>Message eight</i>

180
00:10:48,993 --> 00:10:51,088
<i>Hopper, you should have received
a package today.</i>

181
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,246
<i>It's important. Don't let
anyone know you have it.</i>

182
00:10:53,304 --> 00:10:54,267
<i>You'll be contacted...</i>

183
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,065
- Homicide already played me that.
- Who, the Hardy boys?

184
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:01,211
Well, they're excited by that package.

185
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:03,800
- They think it's tied to Garza.
- Yeah, well, so do I.

186
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,684
- And this is what was inside?
- Yeah.

187
00:11:09,244 --> 00:11:11,731
Why would someone send you
a busted up hourglass?

188
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,514
Yeah, I don't know.

189
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,966
But that's why I need you
to run a trace on my home phone.

190
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:17,800
Incoming calls for the last 12 hours.

191
00:11:17,913 --> 00:11:19,667
If I find the woman
who left that message,

192
00:11:19,668 --> 00:11:20,965
maybe I can get some answers.

193
00:11:25,301 --> 00:11:27,937
How do you know
I won't just turn this into them,

194
00:11:28,885 --> 00:11:30,452
Make all my problems go away?

195
00:11:31,395 --> 00:11:32,300
<i>Hopper!</i>

196
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:39,146
I don't know. I just got a feeling.

197
00:11:46,513 --> 00:11:48,587
Shelton, heard you had Hopper
but you let him go.

198
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,791
But you brought his girlfriend in,
right?

199
00:11:50,792 --> 00:11:51,812
Yeah, where is she?

200
00:11:52,101 --> 00:11:54,045
She's busy.
She'll come in on her own time.

201
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:56,250
Busy? I thought you said
you had an in with her.

202
00:11:56,443 --> 00:11:57,268
Guess not.

203
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,494
- Give the guy a break. It's his wife.
- Ex-wife.

204
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,882
- Right, that's gotta suck.
- Keep laughing.

205
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:03,419
You two are heading into a wall.

206
00:12:03,485 --> 00:12:04,469
Oh, yeah? How's that?

207
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:06,580
You'll never get Andrea Battle
to flip on Hopper.

208
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,649
Really?

209
00:12:08,224 --> 00:12:10,128
Well, who do you think
she'd rather deal with,

210
00:12:10,175 --> 00:12:11,900
I.A. or us?

211
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:25,782
Message on your answering machine
Came from a blocked number.

212
00:12:26,074 --> 00:12:26,941
What kind of a block?

213
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,887
- Law enforcement.
- Did you bypass it?

214
00:12:28,973 --> 00:12:30,091
Gimme some credit.

215
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:33,204
The call came from the home
of a U.S. attorney, Nathan Baxter.

216
00:12:33,542 --> 00:12:36,400
<i>- What happened at the safe house?
- Focus, Baxter.</i>

217
00:12:36,966 --> 00:12:38,103
Is he a friend of yours?

218
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,718
What's going on, Hopper?

219
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,900
That U.S. attorney's
putting together a case

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,600
against the Latin disciples.

221
00:12:47,634 --> 00:12:50,331
Yeah, I heard about the rumors.
What's that got to do with you?

222
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,789
Baxter contacted me
about an l.D. informant I'm running.

223
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:57,522
Damien Ortiz.

224
00:12:57,831 --> 00:12:59,700
I got him to flip against the disciples,

225
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:01,578
had him all holed up
in a safe house, but...

226
00:13:01,925 --> 00:13:03,946
something happened
and the whole thing went south.

227
00:13:03,947 --> 00:13:05,961
<i>Turned me against my own
only to sell my ass out?</i>

228
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:06,867
<i>I didn't sell you out!</i>

229
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:10,300
And what, you thought
you'd just tell me about it at trial?

230
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:12,473
No. I know I shouldn't have kept you
in the dark.

231
00:13:12,872 --> 00:13:14,079
I know it was a mistake.

232
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,160
Yeah, damn right, it was a mistake.

233
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:21,483
Anything else you're not telling me...

234
00:13:21,965 --> 00:13:22,957
... partner?

235
00:13:24,921 --> 00:13:26,385
Yeah, but you wouldn't believe me.

236
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,700
You got an address on Baxter?

237
00:14:11,501 --> 00:14:12,800
I got blood.

238
00:14:13,882 --> 00:14:14,884
I do, too.

239
00:14:38,448 --> 00:14:39,642
- You know her?
- No.

240
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:42,258
But I think she's the woman
who called me about the package.

241
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:44,974
The killer shot her once in the back.
She was running away.

242
00:14:45,012 --> 00:14:47,988
Yeah, if I can get here earlier
tomorrow, I might be able to help her,

243
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:50,992
- maybe get some information...
- What the hell are you talking about?

244
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,400
Something's happening today,

245
00:14:58,285 --> 00:15:00,211
something big,
and I'm at the center of it.

246
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:02,387
I don't know how. I don't know why.

247
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,718
I don't know who's pulling the strings,

248
00:15:04,719 --> 00:15:07,000
but somehow,
all of this is tied together.

249
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:08,927
Damien, Baxter, Garza,

250
00:15:09,987 --> 00:15:11,277
and now this dead woman.

251
00:15:12,606 --> 00:15:14,571
- You think this is a conspiracy?
- Yes.

252
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,300
And I'm the fall guy.

253
00:15:20,614 --> 00:15:22,135
Two years we've been together, right?

254
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:23,656
Two years?

255
00:15:24,081 --> 00:15:26,208
I've never even had a boyfriend
last that long.

256
00:15:26,883 --> 00:15:28,539
We used to finish
each other's sentences.

257
00:15:28,597 --> 00:15:30,659
Now you're running investigations
behind my back,

258
00:15:30,678 --> 00:15:32,527
talking about some conspiracy
against you.

259
00:15:33,326 --> 00:15:35,647
- I wanna believe you...
- You don't believe me, do you?

260
00:15:35,695 --> 00:15:36,543
You lied to me.

261
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
I'll give you a half-hour
before I call this in.

262
00:15:56,332 --> 00:15:57,333
All right.

263
00:16:00,332 --> 00:16:01,300
Hey, Hopper?

264
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,573
Who else you been lying to?

265
00:16:10,627 --> 00:16:12,215
I told you,
I won't go to the station.

266
00:16:12,216 --> 00:16:14,237
- I know.
- And I won't talk to anyone about Brett

267
00:16:14,238 --> 00:16:16,646
- least of all you, Chad.
- Yeah, I got that loud and clear.

268
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,110
I'm not here on police business.

269
00:16:19,235 --> 00:16:20,218
Then why are you here?

270
00:16:20,815 --> 00:16:22,009
Well, it's been a rough day.

271
00:16:22,105 --> 00:16:23,597
I thought you might need a ride home.

272
00:16:24,252 --> 00:16:25,158
You're kidding, right?

273
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:27,280
Yeah, forget it.

274
00:16:28,224 --> 00:16:29,186
Bad idea.

275
00:16:29,418 --> 00:16:30,323
I'll call you a cab.

276
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:32,317
Just wanted to make sure you're okay.

277
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:36,776
Are you... okay?

278
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:41,996
Just let me take you home.

279
00:16:54,986 --> 00:16:56,100
Well, thank you.

280
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:57,600
Yeah, no problem.

281
00:16:58,897 --> 00:16:59,800
Chad, don't.

282
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:02,200
I'm not gonna try anything.

283
00:17:02,552 --> 00:17:04,530
I thought you might want me
to check your place.

284
00:17:04,645 --> 00:17:05,543
Why?

285
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:07,500
I'm worried about you,

286
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,654
- What, with Hopper out there somewhere.
- Chad...

287
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,713
No, I'm just saying,
he's armed and dangerous...

288
00:17:11,714 --> 00:17:14,046
- Brett would never hurt me.
- Not on purpose.

289
00:17:14,624 --> 00:17:16,569
Things can go sideways.
I mean, I've seen it.

290
00:17:16,626 --> 00:17:17,435
A couple years ago,

291
00:17:17,455 --> 00:17:20,300
cops were serving a warrant
on this cripple in Tarzana.

292
00:17:20,389 --> 00:17:22,281
- The guy pulls a gun...
- And they shot him.

293
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:24,250
Turns out they had
the wrong address, right?

294
00:17:25,262 --> 00:17:27,300
You forget, I know all your stories.

295
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:30,400
- Yeah, I guess you do.
- Yeah, I do.

296
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:33,700
Well, look, if you want,
I can stay over.

297
00:17:35,325 --> 00:17:36,600
On the couch, of course.

298
00:17:37,656 --> 00:17:39,119
Thank you for the ride, Chad.

299
00:17:39,678 --> 00:17:40,853
Let's just leave it at that.

300
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,614
Shelton.

301
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:56,997
Hey, Buck.

302
00:18:01,571 --> 00:18:03,381
Yeah, I think I can still make it.

303
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:06,406
Where'd you say that bar was?

304
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,500
It's the place on Los Feliz.

305
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:11,260
I'll see you there.

306
00:18:38,377 --> 00:18:39,783
What happened to your shoulder?

307
00:18:39,937 --> 00:18:40,919
I'm okay. I'm okay.

308
00:18:41,054 --> 00:18:43,249
- You're bleeding. Let me see.
- Rita, I'm fine.

309
00:18:44,202 --> 00:18:46,700
I just came by to make sure
that you got here safely.

310
00:18:47,342 --> 00:18:48,600
Chad drove me home.

311
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,187
Chad?

312
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:52,746
Yeah, he was...

313
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:54,701
He was worried that maybe you'd get

314
00:18:54,702 --> 00:18:55,982
- angry or something.
- Listen,

315
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:57,639
I promise I will tell you everything.

316
00:18:57,735 --> 00:18:58,718
I just...

317
00:18:59,074 --> 00:19:00,403
I don't have the time right now,

318
00:19:00,808 --> 00:19:01,732
all right?

319
00:19:03,023 --> 00:19:04,256
Then you're gonna make time.

320
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,582
I have been worried sick,

321
00:19:06,986 --> 00:19:08,797
and Chad says
you've been accused of murder?

322
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:11,224
Since when do you start believing
everything Chad says?

323
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:12,745
When you put a gun on him.

324
00:19:12,996 --> 00:19:14,960
You came to the hospital,
a place where I work,

325
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:16,017
and brought a gun.

326
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,175
And now you don't wanna talk about it?

327
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:20,601
You won't understand.

328
00:19:20,890 --> 00:19:22,600
God, I want to understand!

329
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:25,500
But you are scaring me, Brett.

330
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:28,584
I just wanna know
what happened to the man

331
00:19:28,603 --> 00:19:29,899
I went to bed with last night.

332
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:31,505
Look,

333
00:19:31,543 --> 00:19:33,900
I know that I shouldn't have come here
tonight.

334
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:35,742
And I'm sorry, but I just...

335
00:19:35,781 --> 00:19:37,334
I wanted to make sure that you...

336
00:19:38,374 --> 00:19:39,588
You were all right.

337
00:19:42,593 --> 00:19:43,614
I'm not all right.

338
00:19:45,848 --> 00:19:47,492
Please... Please just go.

339
00:19:53,904 --> 00:19:54,906
Please.

340
00:20:25,843 --> 00:20:26,999
<i>Stop! Stop!</i>

341
00:20:27,621 --> 00:20:29,220
<i>If you think that first step's a bitch,</i>

342
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,779
<i>- wait till the next one.
- Damien...</i>

343
00:20:32,263 --> 00:20:33,804
Oh, hell no.

344
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:42,891
Fellas, look,

345
00:20:43,681 --> 00:20:45,703
I know I forgot to call Damien.
I know that.

346
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,700
You know, I missed my 9:00.
I realize that.

347
00:20:47,735 --> 00:20:49,105
I just... I've been, like...

348
00:20:49,797 --> 00:20:51,877
Like, crazy, crazy busy.

349
00:20:52,263 --> 00:20:53,361
He'll get that, right?

350
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:57,775
So we cool?

351
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:01,512
I know.

352
00:21:09,943 --> 00:21:10,887
Damien!

353
00:21:11,542 --> 00:21:12,755
I can explain.

354
00:21:12,832 --> 00:21:14,400
- I can explain.
- Too bad.

355
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:16,707
The time for explaining's over.

356
00:21:17,073 --> 00:21:19,404
I thought we had a deal.
I help you, you help me.

357
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:21,428
- Win-win for everyone, right?
- Yes, and you...

358
00:21:21,429 --> 00:21:23,876
- I put myself out there for you!
- You did the right thing!

359
00:21:23,895 --> 00:21:24,572
You think so?

360
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,301
You wanna know what happened
to the last dude

361
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:28,631
who snitched on a rival banger?

362
00:21:29,517 --> 00:21:30,265
Let me guess.

363
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
He got taken to an abandoned
parking structure?

364
00:21:32,393 --> 00:21:33,606
No, man.

365
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:35,900
He got territory.

366
00:21:36,553 --> 00:21:39,115
Got rid of the competition,
scored 12 blocks all his own.

367
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:40,250
Upped his production

368
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:42,013
by 150%.

369
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,575
The dude was making five figures a week.

370
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:47,156
He got treated right.

371
00:21:47,965 --> 00:21:48,774
Me?

372
00:21:48,813 --> 00:21:50,565
I let you talk me into ratting out
my boys,

373
00:21:50,586 --> 00:21:52,435
you stick me at some safe house,
and then?

374
00:21:52,955 --> 00:21:55,563
- I almost get my ass shot off.
- Damien, you gotta believe me.

375
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,297
I wanna believe you, Hopper,
I really do!

376
00:21:57,365 --> 00:21:59,387
Only I can't find you,
you don't return my calls,

377
00:21:59,407 --> 00:22:01,214
and when I reach out to you,
you blow me off!

378
00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:02,832
I'm sorry. I've been a little busy!

379
00:22:03,429 --> 00:22:05,256
- You've been busy?
- Yes.

380
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,765
The city's about
to go up in flames, Hop.

381
00:22:11,036 --> 00:22:13,249
There're deals being cut right now
that I'm not even...

382
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,900
What deals?

383
00:22:16,138 --> 00:22:17,100
What deals?

384
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,900
You have no idea
how big this is, do you?

385
00:22:20,523 --> 00:22:21,446
Well, tell me.

386
00:22:21,726 --> 00:22:22,881
You haven't earned that.

387
00:22:24,153 --> 00:22:26,445
See, on the street,
all you got is your word.

388
00:22:26,701 --> 00:22:28,434
There's no contracts, no lawyers.

389
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,188
You break your word,
there's a price to pay!

390
00:22:32,227 --> 00:22:33,152
Simple.

391
00:22:34,082 --> 00:22:34,987
What's in the back?

392
00:22:37,895 --> 00:22:38,858
That?

393
00:22:45,831 --> 00:22:47,200
You remember Baxter, right?

394
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,965
<i>You two chotas</i>

395
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,065
were the only ones to know
about that safe house.

396
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:04,558
So one of you is gonna die tonight.

397
00:23:04,597 --> 00:23:06,900
- You're making a big mistake.
- You made the mistake!

398
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:08,512
Somebody gave you up at the safe house,

399
00:23:08,665 --> 00:23:10,688
But it wasn't Baxter, it wasn't me!

400
00:23:11,054 --> 00:23:11,863
All right?

401
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,394
We've been set up, man!

402
00:23:13,538 --> 00:23:14,674
- Set up?
- Yes!

403
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,063
- By who?
- I don't know but I'll figure that out.

404
00:23:17,419 --> 00:23:19,172
I just need a little bit more time.

405
00:23:19,749 --> 00:23:21,502
Just a little bit more time, Damien.

406
00:23:22,612 --> 00:23:23,633
Can you do that?

407
00:23:25,713 --> 00:23:27,505
I'm gonna find out who's behind this.

408
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,854
Alright? You got my word on that.

409
00:23:37,807 --> 00:23:38,847
You know what, Hop?

410
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:41,332
I believe you.

411
00:23:50,122 --> 00:23:51,300
We're done.

412
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:53,003
I see you again,

413
00:23:53,735 --> 00:23:55,000
and you're dead, too.

414
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:39,522
Hey, you're up early.

415
00:24:42,007 --> 00:24:43,700
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

416
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:46,293
What's wrong? Are you mad at me?

417
00:24:48,971 --> 00:24:49,895
Nice grab.

418
00:24:50,112 --> 00:24:52,100
Yeah, I was just... Just lucky.

419
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,482
Look, I'm sorry. I just got...
I got a lot going on right now.

420
00:24:57,923 --> 00:24:59,040
You want to talk about it?

421
00:25:05,498 --> 00:25:08,454
Yeah, yeah, I do, actually.

422
00:25:09,779 --> 00:25:11,204
I have this... This case,

423
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,000
And there's a witness

424
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:16,200
and the witness has a hit out on her.

425
00:25:17,325 --> 00:25:18,500
And I need to protect her.

426
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:22,860
But if I do, then I won't have time
for the case.

427
00:25:22,861 --> 00:25:23,900
Don't you have help?

428
00:25:23,977 --> 00:25:25,846
No, it's complicated.

429
00:25:26,578 --> 00:25:29,063
So if you don't protect her,
will she get hurt?

430
00:25:32,513 --> 00:25:33,533
I don't know.

431
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,325
Well, I think it's obvious.

432
00:25:36,615 --> 00:25:39,365
The only way to protect her
is to get to the bottom of it, right?

433
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,946
Solve the case.
Wouldn't that make her safe?

434
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:44,900
I hope so.

435
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:47,000
Solve the case.

436
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,321
What was that for?

437
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,657
Just for being you.

438
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,900
If Chad calls, talk to him.

439
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:37,244
<i>Okay, and this judge Nitzberg...</i>

440
00:26:48,317 --> 00:26:49,400
This is Margo.

441
00:26:49,616 --> 00:26:51,219
Hey, where the hell are you?

442
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,200
Who's this?

443
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:55,185
The meeting got pushed up. You're late!

444
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:56,500
I didn't hear about this.

445
00:26:56,517 --> 00:26:59,204
No, Nitzberg is looking for you.
He's really upset.

446
00:26:59,416 --> 00:27:02,459
- Okay. Give me 20 minutes.
- You gotta get here

447
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:05,300
- and don't stop for coffee!
- Okay, I'll be right there.

448
00:27:05,643 --> 00:27:07,200
I said, don't stop for coffee!

449
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
Yes, sir, will do.

450
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,286
So?

451
00:27:31,643 --> 00:27:32,600
So we wait.

452
00:27:34,092 --> 00:27:36,600
Was he pissed about the guy in the tub?

453
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:38,800
What do you think?

454
00:27:42,364 --> 00:27:45,019
You know what a one-Bedroom runs
in this neighborhood?

455
00:27:45,638 --> 00:27:46,800
I don't know, $1,200?

456
00:27:48,982 --> 00:27:50,300
That's ludicrous.

457
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:52,794
- What, are you moving here?
- No.

458
00:27:52,869 --> 00:27:53,929
So what do you care?

459
00:27:54,727 --> 00:27:55,749
Morning, boys.

460
00:27:56,087 --> 00:27:57,000
Don't do that.

461
00:27:59,592 --> 00:28:01,757
- Can we help?
- You can start by putting your hands

462
00:28:01,758 --> 00:28:02,701
where I can see 'em.

463
00:28:07,182 --> 00:28:09,900
Now... why are you following me?

464
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:11,500
We're just sitting here.

465
00:28:11,591 --> 00:28:13,759
- And videotaping me?
- We're tourists.

466
00:28:13,853 --> 00:28:16,530
Yeah, know any good places to eat
around here?

467
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:21,138
Now I know you've been following
my girlfriend and my sister,

468
00:28:21,204 --> 00:28:23,146
and I know about the guy in the quarry.

469
00:28:23,465 --> 00:28:25,400
I wanna speak to him right now.

470
00:28:25,473 --> 00:28:27,612
All right, listen, you got us, okay?

471
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:30,424
I'm just gonna reach for my phone.

472
00:28:37,548 --> 00:28:38,600
Yeah, it's me again...

473
00:28:38,918 --> 00:28:40,100
Hey, who the hell are you?

474
00:28:54,663 --> 00:28:56,700
- Move, I got a shot!
- Don't shoot!

475
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,600
- I can get him! Just move!
- Don't shoot!

476
00:29:04,468 --> 00:29:05,856
Get out of the way!

477
00:29:23,192 --> 00:29:24,224
Drive!

478
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,200
The balls on that guy.

479
00:29:48,421 --> 00:29:49,472
Wanna go back?

480
00:29:50,063 --> 00:29:51,500
No, we gotta call it in.

481
00:29:55,357 --> 00:29:56,502
Where's your phone?

482
00:30:09,538 --> 00:30:11,100
An assistant D.A. got hit last night.

483
00:30:11,424 --> 00:30:12,747
Hopper's a prime suspect.

484
00:30:12,878 --> 00:30:14,624
There's a warrant out for his arrest.

485
00:30:15,733 --> 00:30:17,346
There must be some mistake.

486
00:30:17,741 --> 00:30:19,964
Yeah, it's hard to believe.
You think you know someone,

487
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,668
then they do something crazy like that.

488
00:30:21,724 --> 00:30:23,029
Brett didn't kill anyone.

489
00:30:23,413 --> 00:30:24,445
I hear it different.

490
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,500
Sorry to be the one to tell you.

491
00:30:27,771 --> 00:30:28,779
Hopper's in real trouble.

492
00:30:28,855 --> 00:30:31,808
There are a couple guys downtown
wanna talk to you about it.

493
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:38,000
Look, you don't have to go,
but it might be helpful...

494
00:30:39,082 --> 00:30:40,124
For Hopper's sake.

495
00:30:43,682 --> 00:30:46,200
Okay. Just let me get my bag.

496
00:30:54,651 --> 00:30:56,706
- Hopper, what are you doing here?
- Where is she?

497
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,800
- Where's who?
- The girl, Baxter.

498
00:30:58,882 --> 00:31:01,050
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.

499
00:31:01,256 --> 00:31:05,300
5'7", dark hair, blue eyes,
legs that won't quit.

500
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,965
How do you...
What, are you following me?

501
00:31:09,398 --> 00:31:10,439
Hopper!

502
00:31:15,426 --> 00:31:17,600
Hey, did you call me? Was it you?

503
00:31:17,766 --> 00:31:18,477
What?

504
00:31:18,478 --> 00:31:20,651
You called and left me a message
about this package.

505
00:31:20,689 --> 00:31:22,477
You said it was very important.

506
00:31:23,143 --> 00:31:24,586
- You're Hopper?
- Yeah.

507
00:31:26,181 --> 00:31:28,335
He told me to call you.
He said you'd understand.

508
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:29,800
Who? Who told you to call me?

509
00:31:30,173 --> 00:31:31,215
Garza.

510
00:31:32,256 --> 00:31:33,300
Garza?

511
00:31:34,107 --> 00:31:35,758
Did he send me this package?

512
00:31:45,535 --> 00:31:46,500
Yeah.

513
00:31:46,542 --> 00:31:49,150
<i>He's here. Hopper, he's
at my house right now.</i>

514
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:53,780
Come on.

515
00:31:54,024 --> 00:31:56,979
I don't know how he found out,
but he's upstairs right now.

516
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,016
Hello? Hello?
Did you hear what I just said?

517
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:01,207
Hopper is here.

518
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:09,600
Those guys are yours, huh?
They work for you?

519
00:32:09,676 --> 00:32:11,137
- Who?
- The guys you were calling.

520
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,704
The ones who have been following me.

521
00:32:12,751 --> 00:32:14,977
What? No, those guys are squeezing me.

522
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,500
- You're gonna tell me everything.
- They'll kill me.

523
00:32:17,567 --> 00:32:18,599
I'll kill you!

524
00:32:25,338 --> 00:32:26,400
<i>Cálmate!</i>

525
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:27,562
<i>Estuvo!</i>

526
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:28,700
<i>Cálmate!</i>

527
00:32:43,985 --> 00:32:45,588
Just answer their questions truthfully.

528
00:32:45,635 --> 00:32:46,800
They're not after you.

529
00:32:49,308 --> 00:32:50,858
Remember, I got your back.

530
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:52,600
I'll be all right, Chad.

531
00:32:56,079 --> 00:32:57,794
You're Jennifer, right? Brett's sister.

532
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,214
Yeah. Rita, right?

533
00:32:59,289 --> 00:33:00,096
Yeah.

534
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:02,202
I just want you to know
that everything'll be okay.

535
00:33:02,203 --> 00:33:03,609
Brett was with me with last night.

536
00:33:04,054 --> 00:33:05,912
With you? But I thought...

537
00:33:09,176 --> 00:33:10,500
So you two...

538
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:12,293
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.

539
00:33:12,856 --> 00:33:14,919
I've been trying to get a number
for your mom.

540
00:33:15,023 --> 00:33:17,780
That's not a good idea.
She and Brett don't really talk anymore.

541
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:20,060
Real tight family you got there, huh?

542
00:33:22,823 --> 00:33:25,215
Listen, if I hear anything,
I'm gonna give you a call.

543
00:33:25,421 --> 00:33:26,400
I'm sure he's okay.

544
00:33:27,364 --> 00:33:28,400
Thank you.

545
00:33:38,007 --> 00:33:40,000
You gotta call Damien.

546
00:33:40,463 --> 00:33:42,100
You're making a big mistake.

547
00:33:42,609 --> 00:33:44,381
You're mak... Call Damien!

548
00:33:44,391 --> 00:33:45,239
Help!

549
00:33:47,897 --> 00:33:50,206
Where are they taking us?
What are they gonna do?

550
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:52,684
- You don't wanna know.
- We gotta get outta here, Hopper!

551
00:33:52,685 --> 00:33:55,154
- We gotta get out!
- Damien knows you sold him out.

552
00:33:55,641 --> 00:33:59,195
- What? No, I'd never do that.
- Shut up. Don't waste your breath.

553
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:01,492
He knows.

554
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:04,800
Now your only hope
of getting out of here is me,

555
00:34:04,884 --> 00:34:06,216
so you better start talking.

556
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,205
I never got their names.
They came to me a 2 days ago.

557
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:12,860
Two men said they wanted information
about Damien.

558
00:34:12,982 --> 00:34:13,992
Why Damien?

559
00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:15,800
Why Damien?

560
00:34:15,838 --> 00:34:18,053
The Latin disciples
are getting into contract killings.

561
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:19,300
Damien knows names.

562
00:34:19,387 --> 00:34:21,263
What does that have to do
with Garza or me?

563
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:22,800
I have no idea. I swear.

564
00:34:24,216 --> 00:34:26,000
Damien was my informant,

565
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,900
and you used me to get at him.

566
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:29,892
I didn't want to.
They held a gun to my head.

567
00:34:29,893 --> 00:34:31,100
Me or him? I'm gonna pick me.

568
00:34:31,175 --> 00:34:34,102
I vouched for you, man.
I guaranteed Damien his life.

569
00:34:34,496 --> 00:34:36,470
Damien knew exactly
what he was getting into.

570
00:34:36,513 --> 00:34:38,543
In case you forgot, Hopper,
Damien is the bad guy.

571
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:41,200
I don't care who he is.
I gave him my word.

572
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,400
Will you grow up, Hopper?

573
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:44,350
Damien's a killer and a drug dealer.

574
00:34:44,385 --> 00:34:45,938
He's getting exactly what he deserves.

575
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:49,312
Well, you're gonna get
exactly what you deserve.

576
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,838
Because when we reach
that parking structure,

577
00:34:52,232 --> 00:34:55,056
Damien's gonna put a bullet
in your head.

578
00:35:01,193 --> 00:35:03,360
So you're telling us you were
with Hopper last night?

579
00:35:03,387 --> 00:35:04,331
Yes.

580
00:35:05,716 --> 00:35:08,024
And he never went out,
maybe went for a walk?

581
00:35:08,146 --> 00:35:09,591
I was with him all night.

582
00:35:10,682 --> 00:35:11,900
Well, I appreciate that.

583
00:35:11,998 --> 00:35:13,734
And I wanna believe you, I really do.

584
00:35:15,301 --> 00:35:17,252
You know, when we ran
your driver's license,

585
00:35:17,346 --> 00:35:19,123
some interesting information came up.

586
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,820
- That's not relevant.
- We were just wondering if Ms. Shelton

587
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,106
could clarify a few things.
This isn't the first time

588
00:35:24,144 --> 00:35:26,513
that she's been involved
in a questionable incident.

589
00:35:26,578 --> 00:35:27,803
Not going there. Move along.

590
00:35:27,866 --> 00:35:30,029
Chad, if this is all too much for you,
you can go.

591
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:33,551
I go, she goes.

592
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:35,413
Next question.

593
00:35:48,811 --> 00:35:50,528
Any idea where Hopper is now?

594
00:36:02,085 --> 00:36:02,954
Who was she?

595
00:36:03,684 --> 00:36:04,493
Who?

596
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:06,945
The girl.
You seem pretty upset about her.

597
00:36:06,946 --> 00:36:09,993
Of course I'm upset about her. I got
my own problems to deal with right now.

598
00:36:10,068 --> 00:36:11,175
What was her name?

599
00:36:11,813 --> 00:36:15,143
Ava. Her name was Ava Reese. I met her
at the courthouse two weeks ago.

600
00:36:15,218 --> 00:36:16,616
What's her connection to Garza?

601
00:36:17,883 --> 00:36:20,091
She worked for him.
What the hell does it matter?

602
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,006
Thank God it's you guys.

603
00:36:48,432 --> 00:36:49,600
Sorry, Hopper.

604
00:36:50,482 --> 00:36:51,533
You took my phone.

605
00:38:44,848 --> 00:38:46,800
Thank you for the ride, Chad.

606
00:38:47,082 --> 00:38:49,500
And thank you for sticking up for me
back there.

607
00:38:49,531 --> 00:38:52,597
What's in your background
is your business, not theirs.

608
00:38:52,935 --> 00:38:54,502
Your secrets safe with me.

609
00:38:55,648 --> 00:38:56,800
And yours with me.

610
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,000
What secret is that?

611
00:39:00,513 --> 00:39:02,690
That you're not always such a hard-ass.

612
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:09,608
Look, if you want, I could stay over...

613
00:39:09,702 --> 00:39:11,269
On the couch, of course...

614
00:39:12,051 --> 00:39:13,561
And keep an eye on things.

615
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:18,358
Let me at least walk you up.
If you feel okay, I'll go.

616
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:21,005
No, I don't want to keep you.
I'm sure you have plans tonight.

617
00:39:21,006 --> 00:39:23,181
No, I'm just gonna meet
this guy in a bar.

618
00:39:23,303 --> 00:39:24,372
I can reschedule.

619
00:39:35,827 --> 00:39:36,746
Hello.

620
00:39:36,803 --> 00:39:37,620
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

621
00:39:37,695 --> 00:39:39,100
Oh, thank God. Are you okay?

622
00:39:39,656 --> 00:39:40,725
Yeah, I'm fine.

623
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:41,954
<i>Where are you?</i>

624
00:39:42,696 --> 00:39:45,504
It's probably best I don't say.
They could be tapping your phone.

625
00:39:46,105 --> 00:39:48,996
They asked me a lot of questions.
They said terrible things about you.

626
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,090
<i>None of it's true.</i>

627
00:39:50,712 --> 00:39:52,426
<i>I'm sorry they put you through
all that.</i>

628
00:39:55,248 --> 00:39:57,152
I just called to make sure
you were safe.

629
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:58,282
Rita...

630
00:39:59,304 --> 00:40:00,308
Everything okay?

631
00:40:05,791 --> 00:40:06,889
I love you.

632
00:40:07,771 --> 00:40:08,900
I love you, too.

633
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:10,745
When will I see you again?

634
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,627
Tomorrow.

635
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,200
I'll see you tomorrow.

636
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,798
Rita?

637
00:40:46,835 --> 00:40:48,187
<i>Hopper, I need your help.</i>

638
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:51,200
I've done something terrible.

639
00:40:51,363 --> 00:40:52,221
<i>Andrea?</i>

640
00:40:52,818 --> 00:40:53,723
<i>Andrea!</i>
