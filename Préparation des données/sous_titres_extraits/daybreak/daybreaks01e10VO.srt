2
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,608
<i>My name is detective Brett Hopper,</i>

3
00:00:12,332 --> 00:00:14,642
<i>and this is the day
that changes everything.</i>

4
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:16,106
Put your hands up!

5
00:00:16,107 --> 00:00:19,088
You're under arrest for the murder
of assistant D.A. Alberto Garza.

6
00:00:19,089 --> 00:00:20,701
<i>I will be framed for murder.</i>

7
00:00:21,384 --> 00:00:23,053
Who the hell are you people?

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,582
<i>My girlfriend Rita will be in danger.</i>

9
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:29,161
<i>I know all this,
because I am living the same day...</i>

10
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:30,992
<i>over and over again.</i>

11
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:32,196
The day is the same

12
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:33,972
but different things happen.

13
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:35,568
<i>Everyday I get an another chance.</i>

14
00:00:35,569 --> 00:00:36,718
For every decision,

15
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,004
there's a consequence.

16
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:39,832
<i>I discovered an alliance</i>

17
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,726
<i>between a city councilman
and street gangs.</i>

18
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,290
A skinhead alliance
with the Latin Disciples.

19
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:46,212
<i>An alliance that led to Garza's murder.</i>

20
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:47,231
All brokered

21
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:48,831
by councilman Booth

22
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,562
and his little lap dog.

23
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:53,950
<i>Turns out that Garza tried to send me
a fax the night he died.</i>

24
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:55,222
<i>Miguel Dominguez?</i>

25
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:57,646
<i>What would Garza send this to you?</i>

26
00:00:57,647 --> 00:00:59,577
He's been in Pelican Bay since 89.

27
00:00:59,578 --> 00:01:02,250
There's no way he could've killed
anyone in 91, let alone Garza.

28
00:01:02,251 --> 00:01:04,556
<i>So, somehow,
I've got to catch Dominguez</i>

29
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:07,720
<i>and find the answers
that would clear my name.</i>

30
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:17,757
Flying to San Francisco.

31
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:19,507
Very romantic.

32
00:01:19,808 --> 00:01:21,127
San Francisco...

33
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:22,511
you alone...

34
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:25,082
First off, it's not even San Francisco.

35
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:26,630
It's Pelican Bay.

36
00:01:27,242 --> 00:01:29,137
It's all the way out
of Nowhere Ville and

37
00:01:29,254 --> 00:01:32,258
believe me, the last thing it is,
is romantic.

38
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:34,157
Do you know what a Supermax is?

39
00:01:34,158 --> 00:01:37,187
Sure, some big grocery store
where you buy things in bulk.

40
00:01:38,428 --> 00:01:40,202
Hello! I was married to a cop.

41
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:45,137
Supermax is like a fortress of solitude
to violent offenders.

42
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:46,439
You're right, well,

43
00:01:46,597 --> 00:01:49,096
I gotta go see this guy there,
Miguel Dominguez.

44
00:01:49,889 --> 00:01:52,664
He's serving five consecutive
life sentences for murder.

45
00:01:52,796 --> 00:01:54,149
Why do you have to go ?

46
00:01:55,072 --> 00:01:56,343
<i>Miguel Dominguez...</i>

47
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:59,678
<i>Why would Garza send this to you?</i>

48
00:02:01,767 --> 00:02:03,486
This guy wants me to go see him.

49
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:05,417
He's a key to this murder case
I'm working on.

50
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,682
That's yours?

51
00:02:08,866 --> 00:02:10,163
That's okay, I got it.

52
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:14,387
Hey.

53
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:17,590
You know,
can I give you a call back?

54
00:02:17,855 --> 00:02:18,862
Who's that?

55
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:20,226
It's just work.

56
00:02:22,263 --> 00:02:24,640
So, what time do you want me
to pick you up in the morning?

57
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:25,645
I got that covered.

58
00:02:26,136 --> 00:02:27,364
- Are you sure?
- Yeah,

59
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,695
I mean, if today is like the passed few,
by the time you wake up,

60
00:02:30,696 --> 00:02:31,734
I'll be back.

61
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:43,476
- Excuse me...
- What?

62
00:02:44,103 --> 00:02:46,516
I'm hearing a sort of horrible clang.

63
00:02:47,507 --> 00:02:49,549
I think we should tell the captain
and turn back.

64
00:02:49,563 --> 00:02:52,553
Was this different from the clang
you heard just a couple of minutes ago ?

65
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:53,558
This one sounds

66
00:02:54,393 --> 00:02:55,865
even more dangerous.

67
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,506
I fly five days a week
all over the world.

68
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:00,548
Airplanes are safer than cars.

69
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:04,044
This is a silver gleaming death machine.

70
00:03:08,444 --> 00:03:09,877
It's nice talking to you, sir.

71
00:03:12,705 --> 00:03:14,098
So do you really travel that much?

72
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,701
San Francisco, Seattle, Japan.

73
00:03:16,993 --> 00:03:18,496
Back to France next week.

74
00:03:18,905 --> 00:03:20,593
I've been to Paris twelve times.

75
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:21,605
Sounds fun.

76
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:23,350
Of course, I've only seen
the Eiffel tower

77
00:03:23,351 --> 00:03:24,518
from my hotel window.

78
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,449
I keep saying I'm gonna go but,

79
00:03:27,453 --> 00:03:30,329
you know how it is,
every time it's the same thing.

80
00:03:30,873 --> 00:03:31,884
Tell me about it.

81
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:34,368
Got to celebrate
my birthday twice though.

82
00:03:34,369 --> 00:03:37,368
'Cause of the international day line.
I'm on way back from Sydney.

83
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:39,089
Today what day is it in Australia?

84
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,268
Well, see,

85
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:42,912
seventeen hours ahead,
so that would make it...

86
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:43,977
Tomorrow.

87
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:45,492
Yeah, I guess it would.

88
00:03:46,363 --> 00:03:47,866
I wish I could get there.

89
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:50,459
- Where? Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

90
00:03:51,969 --> 00:03:54,251
Seems like today is going pretty well.

91
00:03:55,567 --> 00:03:57,744
You gotta live for the moment, right ?

92
00:03:57,994 --> 00:03:59,083
Yeah.

93
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:04,852
Yeah, it's what...

94
00:04:04,988 --> 00:04:06,836
my girlfriend keeps telling me.

95
00:04:08,797 --> 00:04:09,836
Lucky girl.

96
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,995
Excuse me, does he even know
that I'm here ?

97
00:04:24,996 --> 00:04:27,290
You don't have an appointment,
Detective.

98
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,333
You'll have to wait.

99
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:31,017
Yes ma'am, I've been waiting
for three hours.

100
00:04:31,454 --> 00:04:32,473
Detective...

101
00:04:32,711 --> 00:04:34,279
Shelten, is it?

102
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:35,739
Yes, Chad Shelten.

103
00:04:36,914 --> 00:04:37,941
Come on.

104
00:04:39,071 --> 00:04:42,432
You understand that I can't just stop
my day because you drop in.

105
00:04:42,433 --> 00:04:45,468
I appreciate you seeing me,
I won't take you up much of your time.

106
00:04:45,469 --> 00:04:47,491
I need to speak
with one of your prisoners,

107
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:48,730
Miguel Dominguez.

108
00:04:53,013 --> 00:04:55,648
I'm afraid I can't accommodate that,
Detective.

109
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:58,933
An assistant D.A. was murdered
last night in Los Angeles.

110
00:04:58,934 --> 00:05:01,387
Dominguez may have
some information on the killer.

111
00:05:01,388 --> 00:05:05,485
A man who spent the last 17 years
in prison would have information

112
00:05:05,486 --> 00:05:07,254
on a murder that happened last night?

113
00:05:07,255 --> 00:05:08,526
I realize how that may sound...

114
00:05:08,527 --> 00:05:10,578
I'm afraid you come at a bad time,
Detective.

115
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,506
Dominguez shanked a guard
a few days ago.

116
00:05:12,507 --> 00:05:16,730
That's his third incident this year
and we put him in solitary confinement.

117
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:17,742
No visitors.

118
00:05:18,036 --> 00:05:19,047
No exceptions.

119
00:05:19,048 --> 00:05:20,595
I really need to speak with him.

120
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,700
I'm sorry.

121
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,210
- Five minutes.
- Detective.

122
00:05:24,144 --> 00:05:26,249
You've come a long way for nothing.

123
00:05:29,856 --> 00:05:30,867
Yes.

124
00:05:31,335 --> 00:05:34,235
Bob Nedgo,
I have Mr. Detweiler returning.

125
00:05:34,684 --> 00:05:35,982
<i>For every decision,</i>

126
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:37,985
<i>there's a consequence.</i>

127
00:05:41,154 --> 00:05:43,222
Good luck with your case, Detective.

128
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:44,907
See you soon.

129
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,364
Everything is gonna be fine.

130
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:02,291
Nothing's gonna happen to this plane.

131
00:06:02,292 --> 00:06:03,317
How do you know?

132
00:06:04,263 --> 00:06:05,887
Because my day is repeating.

133
00:06:05,888 --> 00:06:08,823
I was here yesterday
and this plane doesn't crash.

134
00:06:09,523 --> 00:06:10,781
I watch TV.

135
00:06:11,046 --> 00:06:12,590
Planes crash all the time.

136
00:06:14,148 --> 00:06:15,993
So, if your day is repeating...

137
00:06:16,547 --> 00:06:18,146
What do you know about me?

138
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:29,359
I hope we didn't keep you
waiting too long.

139
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,092
Detective Shelten, is it?

140
00:06:31,215 --> 00:06:32,226
Yeah.

141
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,111
And...

142
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:37,150
Detweiler sent you?

143
00:06:40,218 --> 00:06:41,911
If you don't mind me asking,

144
00:06:41,912 --> 00:06:43,865
what exactly is your association
with him?

145
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:45,424
We share a common interest.

146
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:48,271
And he sent you here for me?

147
00:06:48,272 --> 00:06:50,607
Relax, he just wants to know
what happened with the guard

148
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:51,686
that Dominguez shanked.

149
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:52,998
That's being handled.

150
00:06:52,999 --> 00:06:54,681
I sort of promised I'd talk to him.

151
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:55,803
See what went down.

152
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,457
You want to talk to Dominguez?

153
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,904
Detweiler wants to know
the whole story.

154
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:08,476
Get the hell out of my office.

155
00:07:08,477 --> 00:07:11,028
He's not gonna be too pleased
with you filling me out like this.

156
00:07:11,029 --> 00:07:12,039
Who? Detweiler?

157
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,102
Detweiler didn't send you here.

158
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,023
Mr. Parrison, get a guard in here

159
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:22,590
to escort this gentleman
off the facility.

160
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:36,096
Hey man, why don't you take this?
It'll help you relax.

161
00:07:36,542 --> 00:07:37,554
Thanks.

162
00:07:37,845 --> 00:07:38,918
Mister Pusherman.

163
00:07:39,454 --> 00:07:40,677
But I'll just say no.

164
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,381
I'm a police officer.

165
00:07:42,845 --> 00:07:43,884
Narcotics Unit.

166
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:46,821
This is a prescription med,
it helps relieve anxiety.

167
00:07:47,406 --> 00:07:48,418
You're gonna take this,

168
00:07:48,419 --> 00:07:51,427
and you're gonna stop moaning about
how unsafe you think the plane is.

169
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:53,683
You're scaring the others passengers.

170
00:07:56,403 --> 00:07:57,414
Take it.

171
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,527
Okay, thank you.

172
00:08:03,623 --> 00:08:05,712
And, the next time you're in Paris,

173
00:08:06,075 --> 00:08:08,076
you should visit the Eiffel tower.

174
00:08:09,397 --> 00:08:10,422
Don't wait.

175
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:19,223
So, Detweiler sent you?

176
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:21,812
Told me to get up here
as soon as I could.

177
00:08:23,029 --> 00:08:24,906
You don't mind me asking what...

178
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,456
what exactly is your association
with him?

179
00:08:27,457 --> 00:08:29,247
Fencik and Buchatler were busy.

180
00:08:31,597 --> 00:08:33,317
Listen, I'm not here to bust your hump.

181
00:08:33,318 --> 00:08:37,083
Detweiler is just a little concerned
about this Dominguez situation.

182
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,707
Well, I already spoke to him about it.

183
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,057
Come on, you know how he gets.

184
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:42,387
Always telling everybody how...

185
00:08:42,432 --> 00:08:43,888
serious he is.

186
00:08:44,884 --> 00:08:47,757
I told him we shouldn’t put Dominguez
in Gen Pop.

187
00:08:47,758 --> 00:08:49,734
Now he's upset
that there is a price to pay.

188
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:51,497
Well, he's a tough guy to work for.

189
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,498
Don't I know it...

190
00:08:52,678 --> 00:08:55,767
I've spent 12 years under that man
since the time when he was a warden.

191
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:58,904
I swear to God, if I never hear
those two words again...

192
00:08:58,989 --> 00:09:00,085
Decision...

193
00:09:00,361 --> 00:09:01,679
Consequence.

194
00:09:08,794 --> 00:09:10,571
So, what do you need from me?

195
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:13,307
You've got five minutes.

196
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:27,425
Where the hell are you?

197
00:09:56,405 --> 00:09:57,871
Some wrong with the food?

198
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,142
Another guy in a tub.

199
00:10:06,134 --> 00:10:08,156
I staked that place out for a week.

200
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:12,071
- Never once was that guy...
- So you did what you have to do.

201
00:10:12,075 --> 00:10:13,461
Yeah, well, feels...

202
00:10:15,066 --> 00:10:16,094
Unprofessional.

203
00:10:17,097 --> 00:10:20,214
Unprofessional is yapping
about it all morning.

204
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,423
There bigger problem than
some guy flowed in his tub.

205
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:27,611
- What? The GPS thing?
- Yeah, the GPS thing.

206
00:10:27,658 --> 00:10:29,437
How we're gonna find Hopper without it?

207
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:30,532
Call some favors.

208
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:33,112
OK, think your guys can help us out?

209
00:10:35,913 --> 00:10:39,338
We're cruising brown town looking for
that gang banger from the safe house.

210
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:41,260
Great.

211
00:10:42,607 --> 00:10:46,734
This job is a lot easier now.
All we've to do is take out the trash.

212
00:10:47,239 --> 00:10:49,007
Slow down, you're gonna choke.

213
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:52,014
When is the last time you ate?

214
00:10:53,174 --> 00:10:56,063
Couldn't say.
Did you bring the Dominguez file?

215
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:04,325
OK, I'll buy it.

216
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:08,159
Why are you looking at a guy
who's been in lock-up for 17 years?

217
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:09,609
I think he killed Garza.

218
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,405
Hopper, the only thing
this guy is killing is time.

219
00:11:17,406 --> 00:11:18,969
They call him "El Llorón".

220
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:20,386
The Crying Man.

221
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:22,790
They say he's a ghost.
He can walk the walls,

222
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,879
he sees everything, hears everything.

223
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,713
Even though he's in locked up,

224
00:11:26,714 --> 00:11:29,195
people fear him
like he's the Boogie Man.

225
00:11:29,995 --> 00:11:31,035
What's he in for?

226
00:11:31,426 --> 00:11:33,998
Killed his whole family.
Both parents, kid sister.

227
00:11:33,999 --> 00:11:35,806
They found him covered in blood,

228
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:39,105
at the breakfast table,
just sitting, eating his cereal.

229
00:11:40,984 --> 00:11:42,460
OK, he's a psychopath.

230
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:46,526
But this guy's on ice in Pelican Bay.
Even ghost don't get over there.

231
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:49,508
That's what I thought, but the magic
trick isn't walking through walls.

232
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,092
He's left to the back door.

233
00:11:52,576 --> 00:11:54,829
You're telling me
somebody let this guy out of prison?

234
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,847
Yeah.

235
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,977
I've a CI, Damien Ortiz,

236
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,563
he's about
to testify about contract killings

237
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:02,730
within the Latin Disciples.

238
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:07,689
Now I think that LDs are using
Dominguez to do all the dirty work.

239
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:10,608
But why go through all of this trouble?

240
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,252
The streets are full of bangers
who whack their best friends

241
00:12:13,253 --> 00:12:14,771
for a c-note or an 8-ball.

242
00:12:14,772 --> 00:12:16,089
It's the perfect alibi.

243
00:12:16,627 --> 00:12:20,837
If he's behind bars, there's no way
he could possibly pull the trigger.

244
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,854
OK, suppose it's true.
How you're gonna prove it?

245
00:12:27,695 --> 00:12:28,698
OK, what do you need?

246
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:32,413
I need you to look into unsolved
homicides over the passed 17 years.

247
00:12:32,414 --> 00:12:34,584
MO : one shot to the head,
two to the body.

248
00:12:34,585 --> 00:12:35,665
Execution style.

249
00:12:36,147 --> 00:12:37,609
Same way Garza went down.

250
00:12:37,814 --> 00:12:40,728
Go see Detective Choi
at Robbery/Homicide. He'll listen.

251
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:44,134
See if Dominguez left prints
at any of the crime scenes.

252
00:12:44,135 --> 00:12:46,269
But if this Dominguez guy
is as good as you say he's,

253
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,326
you think he'd be
careless enough to leave a print?

254
00:12:48,327 --> 00:12:51,150
Yeah, he did it before. He killed
this girl named Isabelle Contreras.

255
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,831
He left one there. Of course,
he could just be taunting the police,

256
00:12:53,832 --> 00:12:55,483
telling us he can't be caught.

257
00:12:55,511 --> 00:12:56,661
But you're gonna try anyway?

258
00:12:56,662 --> 00:12:59,062
Yeah, I'm being framed
for a murder he committed.

259
00:12:59,063 --> 00:13:00,234
I gotta to find him.

260
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:02,584
You said it, this guy's a ghost.
How you're gonna do that?

261
00:13:02,585 --> 00:13:04,557
By getting my informer to inform.

262
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,499
You pull me out of my niece's birthday
for this ?

263
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,563
I'll ask them
to save you a piece of birthday cake.

264
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:11,612
No, man.

265
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:13,804
I'm not doing this. We're through, Hop!

266
00:13:13,805 --> 00:13:16,429
I know that the LDs
are into murder for hire.

267
00:13:17,823 --> 00:13:20,452
I also know that's why Baxter
and the feds want you to testify.

268
00:13:20,453 --> 00:13:23,141
- How the hell you know that ?
- You were gonna give my name ?

269
00:13:23,142 --> 00:13:26,305
Louis Torrez.
He's the one who's running all the hits.

270
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:28,485
This bastard thinks
he can pull on our faces,

271
00:13:28,486 --> 00:13:30,251
he's soon no smaller than a gang banger ?

272
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,181
He's sailing his own disciples
down the river.

273
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:34,175
- You want him ?
- He's protected, Hop !

274
00:13:34,366 --> 00:13:36,755
- He's connected...
- To a councilman named Tobias Booth.

275
00:13:36,779 --> 00:13:38,768
Yeah, I know. He's going down too.

276
00:13:38,858 --> 00:13:41,641
Look at you,
Detective Hopper with the 411.

277
00:13:43,895 --> 00:13:45,243
Alright. I'm listening.

278
00:13:45,501 --> 00:13:48,294
You can get Torrez
after I get what I need from him.

279
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:49,715
Oh yeah ! What's that ?

280
00:13:50,108 --> 00:13:51,118
<i>El Llorón.</i>

281
00:13:54,725 --> 00:13:55,735
Use the front.

282
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,860
- What ?
- He's the LDs secret weapon.

283
00:14:01,861 --> 00:14:03,373
Torrez is the dispatcher.

284
00:14:03,447 --> 00:14:05,807
Someone orders a hit,
Torrez makes the call,

285
00:14:05,865 --> 00:14:08,301
El Llorón pulls out,
he's got a "out of the jail" free card.

286
00:14:08,302 --> 00:14:09,992
You didn't know that, did you ?

287
00:14:09,993 --> 00:14:11,159
Not about El Llorón.

288
00:14:13,161 --> 00:14:15,649
- I'd stay clear...
- I gotta have him.

289
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:18,159
The Crying Man.

290
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:21,445
If this whole thing goes down
the way I think,

291
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:22,610
we could pull them all away.

292
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:24,727
Torrez, Booth, even El Llorón.

293
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:27,693
- So they do a couple of years?
- No, we pull them away for good.

294
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,658
Call the feds, whoever we need.

295
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,578
That's gonna leave a lot more room
at the top of the LD food chain.

296
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:35,273
New for an entrepreneur.

297
00:14:35,957 --> 00:14:37,351
A young man with vision.

298
00:14:39,055 --> 00:14:40,382
I know a guy like that.

299
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:43,089
<i>Let me introduce one of
the greatest success stories</i>

300
00:14:43,312 --> 00:14:44,991
of our anti gang initiative.

301
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:49,544
Louis Torrez joined
the Latin Disciples at the age of 14.

302
00:14:49,728 --> 00:14:52,950
Today, Louis is the key contributor
to this community, a member of...

303
00:15:03,725 --> 00:15:05,250
Oh, yeah! <i>Vato</i>!

304
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:08,665
You think anyone believes that crap
about you leaving that life behind?

305
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:10,277
How would you believe what I say?

306
00:15:11,014 --> 00:15:12,367
I don't buy it either.

307
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:17,428
Andrea Battle.
I'm looking for Detective Choi.

308
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:19,278
Battle?
Hopper's partner?

309
00:15:20,236 --> 00:15:22,514
Spivak, I'm in charge
of the Garza murder.

310
00:15:22,634 --> 00:15:24,667
Anything you have to say to Choi,
you say to me.

311
00:15:26,124 --> 00:15:28,889
I need to look through your files
on cold case murders.

312
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:32,061
Anything that went down execution style
in the last 17 years.

313
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:33,810
Execution style, that's good.

314
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:35,413
What?

315
00:15:35,414 --> 00:15:37,119
I admire what you do
to help your partner,

316
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,770
but you might have just deep-sixed him.

317
00:15:39,996 --> 00:15:41,221
Really? How's that?

318
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:45,221
Garza was killed execution style,
but we didn't release that information.

319
00:15:45,222 --> 00:15:46,628
Other than detectives of the scene,

320
00:15:46,629 --> 00:15:48,938
the only other person that knew
that little detail

321
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:49,939
is the killer.

322
00:15:50,918 --> 00:15:52,323
See, that's the problem.

323
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:55,080
'Cause I happen to know
Brett Hopper didn't kill anyone.

324
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:56,085
Great.

325
00:15:56,408 --> 00:15:58,187
Have him come in
and tell someone about it.

326
00:16:00,704 --> 00:16:01,757
You play ball.

327
00:16:02,698 --> 00:16:04,864
I let you pull all the cases you want.

328
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,197
I have a better idea.

329
00:16:08,027 --> 00:16:11,469
I pull the cases that I want,
you play ball with yourself.

330
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:27,132
Easy!

331
00:16:28,858 --> 00:16:30,429
What we're gonna to do is real simple.

332
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,164
You tell me where El Llorón is,
you walk away.

333
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:36,325
You don't, I walk away,
and I leave you with Damien.

334
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,133
- I don't know what you talking about.
- Stop it!

335
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:44,233
I know he escaped from prison,
I know he killed Garza,

336
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,957
and I know you know
where the hell he is.

337
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:47,969
You're mistaken.

338
00:16:48,535 --> 00:16:50,225
I work for councilman Booth!

339
00:16:50,226 --> 00:16:52,762
At least the Latin Disciples
had more respect for who they are.

340
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,151
I left that life behind.

341
00:16:55,546 --> 00:16:58,211
You can lie, <i>ese</i>, but you ain't done

342
00:17:00,706 --> 00:17:01,872
Let me just talked to him!

343
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,336
<i>Vamo!</i>

344
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:05,837
I got this. Easy, easy.

345
00:17:09,327 --> 00:17:10,327
Son of a bitch.

346
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:14,772
You're gonna have to get
that little tattoo removed?

347
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:16,500
You're gonna rip him off
or make him talk?

348
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:17,537
Shut up! I'm still a cop.

349
00:17:17,538 --> 00:17:18,538
Yeah, shut up!

350
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:22,408
What is this?

351
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,322
Whose address is this?

352
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:29,496
That?
That's <i>muy importante.</i>

353
00:17:30,028 --> 00:17:31,861
That's where I hook up
with Damien's mother.

354
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,221
Come on!

355
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:35,454
- Come on.
- Come on! <i>Vamo!</i>

356
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:37,651
- You know what they call you?
- Think I give a damn?

357
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:40,570
- You wanna me say why we call you LD?
- What?

358
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:42,401
- What?
- <i>La Dama!</i>

359
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:43,690
The woman !

360
00:17:44,569 --> 00:17:45,569
I'm cool, Hop.

361
00:17:46,029 --> 00:17:47,640
- I'm cool, right?
- Right?

362
00:17:48,481 --> 00:17:50,199
- I'm good.
- Yeah, run away!

363
00:17:50,749 --> 00:17:51,749
You think it's...

364
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:55,587
Who the hell's gonna know, <i>cabrón?</i>

365
00:17:55,981 --> 00:17:57,036
Who's running?

366
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,780
We are.

367
00:18:12,306 --> 00:18:13,306
Wait!

368
00:18:13,424 --> 00:18:15,179
You gotta tell me about Dominguez.

369
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,180
<i>El Llorón...</i>

370
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,560
He's not the...

371
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:23,037
What?

372
00:18:24,982 --> 00:18:25,989
Torrez!

373
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:36,582
What the hell did you do?

374
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,083
Watch it, Hop! Watch it!

375
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,795
You did it again!

376
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:45,280
- I knew I couldn't trust you.
- What the hell are you talking about?

377
00:18:45,281 --> 00:18:47,299
You say I wouldn't play bad cop for you?

378
00:18:47,453 --> 00:18:49,508
I came here to get my note! Got it?

379
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:51,848
You got a problem with that?

380
00:18:51,849 --> 00:18:54,226
You could lay down
right next to that bitch!

381
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:56,920
What are you doing?

382
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,082
What do you think?
You think I'm gonna stay here?

383
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:01,655
I'm getting the hell out of here, Hop.

384
00:19:01,656 --> 00:19:02,656
You should too.

385
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,074
Spivak!

386
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:18,894
Detective Battle?
You found Jimmy Hoffa yet?

387
00:19:18,895 --> 00:19:20,202
No, but I found these.

388
00:19:20,821 --> 00:19:23,321
Two cold case hits match
and the same MO as Garza:

389
00:19:23,331 --> 00:19:25,209
One to the head, two to the chest.

390
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:28,598
And both crime scenes
had errant prints
belonging to one guy.

391
00:19:29,437 --> 00:19:31,103
Miguel Dominguez, who's that?

392
00:19:31,465 --> 00:19:32,465
Garza's killer.

393
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:36,970
Hold on, this guy was in prison
when the murder was committed.

394
00:19:36,971 --> 00:19:39,808
Listen. I know what I'm suggesting
might sound a little...

395
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:41,257
- Insane?
- Implausible.

396
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:43,841
It's Dominguez.

397
00:19:44,849 --> 00:19:47,166
We just need to find an errant print
from the Garza scene.

398
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:49,517
Oh, we've got an errant print...
On the gun.

399
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:50,834
It belongs to Hopper.

400
00:19:51,219 --> 00:19:52,552
I don't know your partner, but...

401
00:19:52,981 --> 00:19:53,981
He's our guy.

402
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,670
I wanna recheck the gun.

403
00:19:55,671 --> 00:19:58,113
- You're reaching, Battle.
- Then let me reach!

404
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,725
It's how we found Hoffa right ?

405
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:04,949
Beneath the gold post at the metal ends.

406
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:11,033
I need to see the gun
from the Garza murder.

407
00:20:11,195 --> 00:20:12,645
You're the IO?

408
00:20:12,847 --> 00:20:14,539
- Not but I...
- I am.

409
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,366
Do what she wants.

410
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:19,968
Ok, just give me a second.

411
00:20:29,515 --> 00:20:30,764
We don't have the gun.

412
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:32,886
What do you mean?

413
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:34,477
It's been checked out.

414
00:20:34,599 --> 00:20:35,707
Checked out by who?

415
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:38,580
Detective... Spyvak.

416
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,768
I'm Spyvak!

417
00:21:03,769 --> 00:21:06,051
- Yeah.
- I'm Detective Brett Hopper.

418
00:21:06,436 --> 00:21:09,694
I'm conducting a police investigation.
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

419
00:21:09,807 --> 00:21:12,173
My cousin has one of those
and he ain't a real cop.

420
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,694
Show me something else.

421
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:27,328
- What do you want, Brett Hopper?
- May I come in?

422
00:21:37,544 --> 00:21:39,488
Miss Zapanta, you live here by yourself?

423
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:41,459
Alma. Yeah, just me.

424
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:56,377
Do you know a man named Louis Torrez?

425
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:58,424
Tobias Booth?

426
00:21:58,818 --> 00:22:00,353
Doesn't sound like my flavor.

427
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,100
What about Miguel Dominguez?

428
00:22:02,409 --> 00:22:03,940
I don't know, I don't think so.

429
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,047
You don't know
or you just don't remember.

430
00:22:06,226 --> 00:22:09,211
Men in my life come and go,
I don't know who's got a name.

431
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,172
What is this really about?

432
00:22:12,482 --> 00:22:14,689
I found your address in a man's wallet.

433
00:22:15,308 --> 00:22:17,919
Louis Torrez.
I think you may be in danger.

434
00:22:20,247 --> 00:22:22,005
Maybe he just wanted to buy a painting.

435
00:22:22,061 --> 00:22:25,404
Well, I have reason believe he is
a dispatcher for a contract killer.

436
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:26,793
He had your address.

437
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:30,141
- You could be his next target.
- Why would anybody wanna kill me?

438
00:22:37,909 --> 00:22:38,998
Excuse me.

439
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,718
- Andrea, what did you get?
- You were right.

440
00:22:45,962 --> 00:22:48,432
I've found Dominguez's prints
on two other crime scenes.

441
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,840
But not at Garza's.

442
00:22:49,962 --> 00:22:53,032
- What ? Did you recheck the gun ?
- I tried: only one problem.

443
00:22:54,037 --> 00:22:56,105
- It's gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?

444
00:22:56,424 --> 00:22:58,546
Chain of evidence says
Spyvak signed out.

445
00:22:58,724 --> 00:23:00,895
But I was with him,
I'm telling you he had no idea.

446
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:04,067
Alright, it means I gotta go back
tomorrow and get the gun.

447
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:05,729
What are you talking about?

448
00:23:06,414 --> 00:23:07,418
Thanks.

449
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,137
I gotta stop doing that.

450
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:14,939
Miss Zapanta, is there anyone
that you think would wanna harm you?

451
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:16,643
Yeah.

452
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:18,551
But they're dead.

453
00:23:20,157 --> 00:23:21,171
What do you mean?

454
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,927
I can take care of myself, detective.

455
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,537
Why don't you find someone else to save?

456
00:23:48,512 --> 00:23:49,516
Hey, it's me.

457
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:51,810
Thank God. I've been so worried.

458
00:23:51,885 --> 00:23:54,101
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry I haven't had time to...

459
00:23:54,314 --> 00:23:56,527
call you today.
I just want to make sure you're okay.

460
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:58,890
<i>- make sure you were safe.</i>
- I'm fine why wouldn't I be?

461
00:23:59,176 --> 00:24:01,871
I know you've been hearing
a lot of crazy things about me today

462
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:04,202
You need to know,
I'm trying to clear my name.

463
00:24:04,972 --> 00:24:06,456
What's going on? Where are you?

464
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:09,911
I'm waiting for this guy,
Miguel Dominguez.

465
00:24:10,024 --> 00:24:11,695
Sorry I can't tell you more.

466
00:24:12,136 --> 00:24:13,197
Are you with Chad?

467
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:16,005
Yeah. How did you know?

468
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,277
It doesn't matter, just...

469
00:24:17,671 --> 00:24:19,230
stay with him tonight, OK?

470
00:24:19,638 --> 00:24:20,642
Okay.

471
00:24:20,952 --> 00:24:22,004
I see you tomorrow.

472
00:24:22,323 --> 00:24:24,858
Alright baby? I promise,
I see you tomorrow.

473
00:24:28,596 --> 00:24:29,610
Hopper?

474
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,742
- Yeah.
- What did he say?

475
00:24:33,103 --> 00:24:34,737
That I should stay here with you.

476
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:36,136
Really?

477
00:24:37,028 --> 00:24:38,756
You've got a hell of a tasted man.

478
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:49,292
Where do you keep the blankets?

479
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:50,777
Hall closet.

480
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:57,491
Everything okay?

481
00:24:57,566 --> 00:25:00,205
Yeah, one of my bulbs burned out.

482
00:25:00,802 --> 00:25:02,285
Where do you keep spares?

483
00:25:02,791 --> 00:25:03,828
In the kitchen.

484
00:25:26,317 --> 00:25:27,341
Hey! Morning.

485
00:25:33,204 --> 00:25:35,265
You're in a good mood, this morning.

486
00:25:36,446 --> 00:25:38,761
There's this murder case
I've been trying to close off.

487
00:25:39,484 --> 00:25:41,244
Trying to put behind me and...

488
00:25:41,551 --> 00:25:43,818
- They got finally got a handle on it.
- Really?

489
00:25:44,372 --> 00:25:47,024
Yeah, Andrea came up
with some evidence

490
00:25:47,494 --> 00:25:49,978
that kinda support this theory
I got going on, so...

491
00:25:50,332 --> 00:25:51,662
That's great news.

492
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:54,282
I still have to catch the guy, but...

493
00:25:54,296 --> 00:25:56,865
- We should celebrate.
- OK.

494
00:25:58,535 --> 00:25:59,547
Tonight.

495
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:06,476
- Unless you wanna...
- Unless I wanna what?

496
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:09,338
Unless I wanna what?

497
00:26:13,548 --> 00:26:16,500
No, I gotta go to the house
and see what's up to Rambis,

498
00:26:16,501 --> 00:26:20,388
I gotta get this gun, maybe...
get it print in.

499
00:26:21,004 --> 00:26:23,335
I got this stuff too... I'm rather busy.

500
00:26:25,207 --> 00:26:28,078
Zapanta. Z-A-P-A-N-T-A.

501
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:32,369
First name : Alma.
2216 Moulton Avenue.

502
00:26:32,697 --> 00:26:33,800
- <i>Got that?</i>
- Yeah.

503
00:26:34,456 --> 00:26:36,976
- What's so important about this girl?
- She may be the target

504
00:26:36,977 --> 00:26:38,160
of a contract killing.

505
00:26:38,161 --> 00:26:39,833
<i>Anything you can find will be helpful.</i>

506
00:26:39,834 --> 00:26:41,809
I'll look into it.
Did you get the gun yet?

507
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,533
I'm on the way to my apartment
right now.

508
00:26:43,534 --> 00:26:46,374
Had to help... Rita... with some stuff.

509
00:26:46,776 --> 00:26:49,646
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

510
00:26:50,029 --> 00:26:53,282
I've got IA at 11a.m.
Don't let your stuff make me late.

511
00:27:13,136 --> 00:27:15,145
Hey, buddy.
What's up?

512
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:17,311
Want some treats?

513
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:39,600
Let's go!

514
00:27:50,138 --> 00:27:52,571
Hey, Mr. Hopper!
Your apartment has a leak.

515
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:54,401
I know, I was just coming up
to investigate.

516
00:27:54,402 --> 00:27:56,048
No problem, I'll tell the plumbers.

517
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:57,650
- What you doing Mr. Hopper?
- Shut up!

518
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:10,675
Very bad. He was not supposed
to move in here for a week.

519
00:28:10,785 --> 00:28:13,258
- Who?
- The new tenant, Mr. Jarvik.

520
00:28:13,665 --> 00:28:15,127
I should charge him for this.

521
00:28:15,141 --> 00:28:17,383
They were running surveillance on me.

522
00:28:20,348 --> 00:28:23,465
Mr. Zeitoun, these plumbers-- were they
two of them? Tall white dudes?

523
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:24,762
- Dark jackets?
- Yes.

524
00:28:25,103 --> 00:28:28,165
Why would they do this?
I just painted these walls.

525
00:28:47,614 --> 00:28:49,036
Upstairs. Move!

526
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,469
It's Jarvik.

527
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:54,503
He must have come in here
to clean and surprised them.

528
00:28:54,504 --> 00:28:55,542
Them? Who is “them”?

529
00:28:57,009 --> 00:29:00,166
The men that you saw weren't plumbers.
Their names are Fencik and Buchalter.

530
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:02,407
They're parked across the street
in a blue Sedan.

531
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,446
They killed him.

532
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:05,127
Police! Open up!

533
00:29:06,029 --> 00:29:07,245
What's.. What are you doing?

534
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,857
Open the door and don't let them in.

535
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:11,031
- Why?
- Don't let them in, I'm the police.

536
00:29:11,032 --> 00:29:12,042
Don't let in!

537
00:29:17,602 --> 00:29:19,460
Heard some yelling.
Is everything alright?

538
00:29:19,461 --> 00:29:21,621
Yes, everything is fine, no problem.

539
00:29:22,618 --> 00:29:24,491
Have you seen your tenant
from downstairs?

540
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:25,871
Yes, absolutely... No.

541
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:28,160
- Have you seen him or not?
- He was here,

542
00:29:28,161 --> 00:29:30,791
- but no, he's not... There is leak!
- Where's Hopper?

543
00:29:30,887 --> 00:29:32,697
- Where is he?
- I think he's taking care

544
00:29:32,698 --> 00:29:33,853
of the dead man in the tub.

545
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,052
Blue Jay, what's your status?

546
00:29:41,884 --> 00:29:43,934
Blue Jay! No sign of Hopper, sir.

547
00:29:51,017 --> 00:29:52,726
You and me, we're gonna talk.

548
00:30:03,464 --> 00:30:04,475
Tacos, uh?

549
00:30:06,293 --> 00:30:09,114
- Breakfast of champions.
- I'm out for a run this morning.

550
00:30:09,183 --> 00:30:10,932
- Worked up an appetite.
- I know.

551
00:30:11,479 --> 00:30:13,535
Not many people actually outrun SWAT.

552
00:30:23,256 --> 00:30:24,691
The gun's in there.

553
00:30:26,756 --> 00:30:28,439
I don't even wanna know
how you got this.

554
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,864
They planted it in my apartment.

555
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:32,544
They're gonna try and tell
the prints on it are mine.

556
00:30:32,612 --> 00:30:35,195
I've a feeling the real killer left it
as a calling card.

557
00:30:35,387 --> 00:30:36,706
I'm running down this ID.

558
00:30:36,707 --> 00:30:39,668
Say you got it from a drug bust or some,
don't say you got it for me.

559
00:30:39,695 --> 00:30:42,688
- And don't let it out of your sight.
- You think someone'd tamper with it?

560
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:44,389
Think it might get up and walk away.

561
00:30:45,209 --> 00:30:47,765
So I ran a background on Alma Zapanta

562
00:30:47,766 --> 00:30:49,638
No prior, just got speeding tickets.

563
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,223
There's gotta be something.

564
00:30:51,236 --> 00:30:53,779
There is one thing.
I checked with the county records

565
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,089
and apparently she grew up
in foster care.

566
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:58,576
Horrible story.
The parents were murdered.

567
00:30:58,713 --> 00:31:00,763
Ever found the guy who did it?

568
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:02,759
It was her brother.

569
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,918
He almost killed her
after he got the parents.

570
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:06,586
Wait, Zapanta?

571
00:31:06,914 --> 00:31:07,959
Is that her real name?

572
00:31:07,987 --> 00:31:10,105
No. Birth name was Dominguez, why?

573
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,000
Alma Dominguez.

574
00:31:15,161 --> 00:31:16,679
She's El Llorón's sister.

575
00:31:19,603 --> 00:31:21,503
Are you ready Mr. Zeitoun?

576
00:31:25,002 --> 00:31:26,382
Everybody face forward.

577
00:31:33,719 --> 00:31:35,741
Do you recognize any of these men?

578
00:31:39,281 --> 00:31:40,976
Those men.
Those two.

579
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:42,670
Numbers three and six.

580
00:31:42,671 --> 00:31:43,955
They are the plumbers.

581
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:47,104
They're the ones
who put Mr. Jarvik in tub.

582
00:31:49,264 --> 00:31:50,562
They did not fix leak.

583
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,656
Fencik and Buchalter.

584
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,662
They're ex-sheriff's deputies.

585
00:31:58,947 --> 00:32:00,806
Nothing worse than a dirty cop.

586
00:32:01,092 --> 00:32:03,478
Is he tied to one of the other ass
through the wall?

587
00:32:04,578 --> 00:32:06,884
To make you happier,
you can bog 'em 1st degree murder.

588
00:32:18,191 --> 00:32:19,818
I'm Detective Brett Hopper.

589
00:32:20,583 --> 00:32:22,210
- Brett Hopper?
- May I come in?

590
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,213
I need to speak to you
about your brother.

591
00:32:31,214 --> 00:32:33,788
- I don't have a brother.
- His name is Miguel Dominguez.

592
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:35,689
That's your given name, isn't it?

593
00:32:35,744 --> 00:32:36,892
Alma Dominguez?

594
00:32:37,361 --> 00:32:39,370
You must have me confused
with someone else.

595
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:40,655
His name is Miguel.

596
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:43,115
He also goes by El Llorón.
The Crying Man.

597
00:32:43,553 --> 00:32:46,177
He killed your parents,
he tried to kill you.

598
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,962
You don't know anything about me.

599
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:53,862
I know you're lying.

600
00:32:55,201 --> 00:32:56,258
You need to leave.

601
00:32:56,259 --> 00:32:57,832
You've been hiding from him
ever since.

602
00:32:57,833 --> 00:32:59,171
That's why you changed your name?

603
00:32:59,172 --> 00:33:00,919
- Just leave!
- If he knows you're alive,

604
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,134
he's gonna come back after you,
finish what he started.

605
00:33:03,135 --> 00:33:05,567
Your brother's been in prison 17 years

606
00:33:05,568 --> 00:33:08,109
- and you're still scared!
- Just stop it!

607
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:18,168
Oh my God.

608
00:33:19,979 --> 00:33:22,125
I knew this day would come.

609
00:33:23,507 --> 00:33:26,049
You want everybody
to think you're dead, don't you?

610
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:27,239
I am dead.

611
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:31,065
Changing my name

612
00:33:32,391 --> 00:33:34,127
was the only way to be safe.

613
00:33:36,289 --> 00:33:39,688
I'm sorry, but I think somebody
out there already knows the truth.

614
00:33:40,008 --> 00:33:42,304
I found your address in a man's wallet.

615
00:33:42,741 --> 00:33:43,930
Louis Torrez.

616
00:33:43,985 --> 00:33:46,984
I think he may have tracked you down
on behalf of your brother.

617
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:49,486
- My brother's in prison.
- No, he got out.

618
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,051
Killed someone last night.
Alberto Garza.

619
00:33:52,475 --> 00:33:54,143
And I don't think he's done.

620
00:33:54,471 --> 00:33:56,111
How could you know all this?

621
00:33:58,065 --> 00:33:59,077
Excuse me.

622
00:34:01,325 --> 00:34:02,514
I have to take this.

623
00:34:05,617 --> 00:34:07,626
The gun you gave me,
your prints weren't on it.

624
00:34:08,186 --> 00:34:09,826
Were there any prints on it?

625
00:34:12,363 --> 00:34:14,987
Rednazki found an unspent round
in the clip.

626
00:34:15,383 --> 00:34:18,184
There's one clean print on the casing,
but it doesn't make any sense.

627
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:20,932
Yes, because it belong to this guy,
Miguel Dominguez,

628
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,367
<i>locked up in Pelican Bay.</i>

629
00:34:22,422 --> 00:34:23,461
How did you...

630
00:34:25,337 --> 00:34:27,605
Is that the guy
you thought was Alma's fondest brother?

631
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:29,615
Yeah, and I'm afraid
she may be his next victim.

632
00:34:29,682 --> 00:34:31,992
- Hopper, the guy's in prison.
- <i>Andrea, listen to me.</i>

633
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:34,199
I need you to go to Robbery/Homicide.

634
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,004
Find Detective Choi, he'll listen.

635
00:34:36,059 --> 00:34:38,492
Alright, tell him everything,
have him run ballistics.

636
00:34:38,695 --> 00:34:41,578
Tell him the gun should match
the three bullets in Garza's body.

637
00:34:41,633 --> 00:34:42,672
I'm on it.

638
00:34:48,817 --> 00:34:51,619
He just showed... at my door...
That's what I'm telling you.

639
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:54,927
No, his name is Brett Hopper.

640
00:34:55,214 --> 00:34:56,492
He's looking for you.

641
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,225
He knows about you,
the prison, Torrez...

642
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,199
He's standing right here in front of me.
Yeah, I'll tell him.

643
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:10,675
How could you talk to him?

644
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:13,531
How could you protect that monster
after what he did to your family?

645
00:35:13,532 --> 00:35:16,483
- After what he did to you?
- He didn't to this to me!

646
00:35:16,484 --> 00:35:19,955
My father did this to me
and my mother stood there and watched.

647
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:23,613
They're the monsters,
my brother tried to save me.

648
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:25,868
Are you his contact?

649
00:35:27,822 --> 00:35:29,941
Torrez comes here to you.

650
00:35:30,556 --> 00:35:32,366
You give El Llorón the orders.

651
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:35,728
You know why they call him
the crying man ?

652
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:39,131
You think those tears are
for the people he kills?

653
00:35:39,268 --> 00:35:41,086
El Llorón cries for me.

654
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:44,052
You were talking to him
and you said I'll tell him what?

655
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,075
Tell me what?

656
00:35:47,475 --> 00:35:50,305
My brother said that you don't have
to find El Llorón.

657
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,560
El Llorón will find you.

658
00:36:15,928 --> 00:36:18,128
Hey... I've been meaning to tell you:

659
00:36:19,424 --> 00:36:21,816
I knocked down that wall
you hated in the kitchen.

660
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:22,923
You were right.

661
00:36:23,483 --> 00:36:25,451
Makes the whole place feel bigger.

662
00:36:26,914 --> 00:36:29,168
You should come over
check it out some time.

663
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:31,465
<i>Hey, this is Rita...
Leave the message.</i>

664
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:48,618
- What?
- You need to change that ringtone.

665
00:36:50,258 --> 00:36:51,297
I like it.

666
00:37:20,207 --> 00:37:21,861
Some people just don't quit.

667
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:54,146
Where do you keep your blankets ?

668
00:38:22,704 --> 00:38:25,574
Aren't you glad
you finally picked up that phone?

669
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:28,021
I'm a ghost.

670
00:38:29,061 --> 00:38:30,114
I'll be back.

671
00:38:30,647 --> 00:38:31,822
And you'll be dead.

672
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:33,831
You...

673
00:38:33,886 --> 00:38:35,799
and everyone you love.

674
00:38:46,417 --> 00:38:50,220
Miguel Dominguez, you're under arrest
for the murder of Alberto Garza.

675
00:38:50,381 --> 00:38:52,003
You have the right to remain silent,

676
00:38:52,004 --> 00:38:54,887
anything you say can and will be used
against you...

677
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:08,194
Dominguez's prints
are on the murder weapon.

678
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:10,524
We may have a few loose ends,

679
00:39:10,525 --> 00:39:12,998
but everybody can see it as it is,
about now.

680
00:39:13,208 --> 00:39:14,643
And the Feds are on their way.

681
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,691
They'll make sure Dominguez
never steps out of a cell again.

682
00:39:17,746 --> 00:39:20,233
They're also looking into the names
that you provided.

683
00:39:20,234 --> 00:39:22,393
Conrad Detweiler, Tobias Booth.

684
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:24,866
And we'll bring in Mrs. Garza back in

685
00:39:24,867 --> 00:39:26,834
sort out her conflict in testimony.

686
00:39:26,835 --> 00:39:27,846
Alright, good.

687
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,337
It's been a long way to assist you, Hop.

688
00:39:31,338 --> 00:39:33,825
Don't know how you figured it all out
so fast.

689
00:39:35,098 --> 00:39:36,902
It wasn't as fast as it looks.

690
00:39:37,422 --> 00:39:38,433
Well, it's over.

691
00:39:38,624 --> 00:39:39,923
Now you're a free man.

692
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,454
Go home, get some sleep,
you both look like you could use some.

693
00:39:43,455 --> 00:39:46,531
Yeah, the sooner we can put
this day behind us, the better.

694
00:39:46,832 --> 00:39:48,750
Took the words right out of my mouth.

695
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:49,962
Excuse me.

696
00:40:13,232 --> 00:40:14,284
Something wrong?

697
00:40:24,846 --> 00:40:26,281
Everything's gonna be OK.

698
00:40:34,507 --> 00:40:36,612
I think we finally figured it out.

699
00:40:37,801 --> 00:40:39,810
You must be glad
this day is over.

700
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:51,171
You wanna watch the sunrise with me?

701
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:56,439
I'll be right back.

702
00:41:10,015 --> 00:41:12,147

703
00:41:12,297 --> 00:41:13,377
<i>You're a free man.</i>

704
00:41:14,921 --> 00:41:17,353
Here comes the sun!
You're gonna miss it!

705
00:41:52,987 --> 00:41:54,039
Morning.

706
00:42:02,763 --> 00:42:03,911
Something wrong?

707
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:26,761
