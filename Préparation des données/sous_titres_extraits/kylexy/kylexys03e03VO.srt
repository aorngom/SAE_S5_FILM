<i>Prevously on Kyle XY...</i>

2
00:00:02,377 --> 00:00:04,332
You took me.
You took Amanda!

3
00:00:04,432 --> 00:00:07,054
- She won't remember a thing.
- You feeling okay?

4
00:00:07,364 --> 00:00:09,363
It's just this stupid headache
I've had all week.

5
00:00:09,463 --> 00:00:11,537
I hope I didn't embarrass myself
at the after party.

6
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,961
- You weren't at the after party.
- We were there. Weren't we?

7
00:00:15,182 --> 00:00:17,014
Are you going to make me
ask you out?

8
00:00:17,114 --> 00:00:20,229
Your dad technically holds the
keys to my future in his hand.

9
00:00:20,362 --> 00:00:22,832
But I could ask him first.

10
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:26,176
One hundred percent, absolutely
not, over my dead body, no!

11
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:29,028
<i>Sara just left?</i>

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,305
I would never do that to you.

13
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:33,717
I know that.

14
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,230
I want you
to come home with me.

15
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:39,455
You're gonna
have to trust me.

16
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,236
Did everything work out
the way you wanted?

17
00:00:43,685 --> 00:00:44,627
Exactly.

18
00:00:45,212 --> 00:00:47,485
<i>The psychic said your soul
mate would be in danger.</i>

19
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:56,675
<i>After all was said and done,</i>

20
00:00:57,768 --> 00:00:59,643
it wasn't me who needed saving.

21
00:01:00,779 --> 00:01:01,982
It was Jessi.

22
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:08,724
Okay, you got plenty of room.
Watch out!

23
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:10,832
To the left.

24
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:13,777
Good. Straighten it out.

25
00:01:15,317 --> 00:01:17,204
You got it.
Keep going.

26
00:01:17,995 --> 00:01:20,676
We can put a bed here,
maybe get her an armoire.

27
00:01:22,124 --> 00:01:24,332
Are you sure you want
to give up your space?

28
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:26,342
Well, I don't have much choice.

29
00:01:26,442 --> 00:01:28,981
No, not unless you know
a family dying to

30
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:31,125
adopt a teenager grown in a pod.

31
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:33,430
It's the right thing to do.

32
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:35,257
And it's gonna be okay...

33
00:01:35,626 --> 00:01:36,470
right?

34
00:01:37,581 --> 00:01:39,056
It's gonna be okay.

35
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,340
This is so not okay.

36
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,721
Right when I can finally put
this room to good use,

37
00:01:43,821 --> 00:01:45,184
I get a roommate.

38
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:48,238
Will you look
at the big picture here?

39
00:01:49,132 --> 00:01:51,018
Jessi, 24/7,

40
00:01:51,281 --> 00:01:52,737
it's in the house.

41
00:01:54,195 --> 00:01:55,581
We're so screwed.

42
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:56,901
Try not screwed.

43
00:01:58,232 --> 00:01:59,002
What?

44
00:01:59,424 --> 00:02:01,484
For one thing, Andy's out of town,
and for another

45
00:02:01,584 --> 00:02:03,846
I thought she said she was
never having sex with you again.

46
00:02:03,946 --> 00:02:06,417
She'll change her tune.
Like she's gonna resist this.

47
00:02:09,607 --> 00:02:10,893
We're smart people.

48
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:12,757
We can deal.

49
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,345
It's gonna be okay.

50
00:02:33,158 --> 00:02:33,861
Hi

51
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:36,645
Sorry.

52
00:02:47,718 --> 00:02:49,567

What?

66
00:03:35,914 --> 00:03:39,134
- Do I help cook or...
- Jessi, your job is to eat.

67
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,145
I don't eat eggs.

68
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,912
You want a waffle?

69
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,523
- I'll take a waffle.
- Just eat your eggs.

00:03:47,351 --> 00:03:48,624
How'd you sleep, Jessi?

71
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,272
Good, I guess. It's a cot.

72
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,775
- At least you've got your own room.
- Give it up, Josh.

73
00:04:00,088 --> 00:04:01,240
What's wrong?

74
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:03,242
Nothing.

75
00:04:04,579 --> 00:04:06,084
Has anyone seen my cell?

76
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:08,003
Did you check outside?

77
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:11,032
Maybe you left it out there when
you were talking to Mark last night.

78
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,204
Mark? You were talking to Mark?
I told you...

79
00:04:13,304 --> 00:04:14,711
A different Mark, Dad.

80
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:15,855
It better be.

81
00:04:16,049 --> 00:04:17,981
This different Mark
must be really funny.

82
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:19,395
You were giggling a lot.

83
00:04:20,121 --> 00:04:21,905
So, Josh, when does Andy get back?

84
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:23,344
Not soon enough.

85
00:04:23,444 --> 00:04:25,806
Two more days,
and the wait is killing me.

86
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,373
Is she gonna do it?

87
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:29,434
Do what?

88
00:04:30,716 --> 00:04:34,523
You know, reopen the store and
be generous with the merchandise.

89
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,117
That's what you said on the phone.

90
00:04:39,465 --> 00:04:41,530
You're like a human wiretap.

91
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:44,311
I guess privacy in this house
is a thing of the past.

92
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:45,735
Kyle's doing it, too.

93
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:48,401
He's listening
to Amanda play right now.

94
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:52,003
I'm sorry, what?

95
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,584
You were listening to Amanda.

96
00:04:55,705 --> 00:04:57,514
Except she stopped playing.

97
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,201
You're right, she stopped.

98
00:05:01,711 --> 00:05:02,706
<i>You fainted.</i>

99
00:05:04,081 --> 00:05:05,387
<i>I'm calling 911.</i>

100
00:05:05,487 --> 00:05:08,173
No, Mom, please, I stood up
from the piano too fast.

101
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:10,142
There's no reason
for everyone to hover.

102
00:05:10,242 --> 00:05:11,116
Why now?

103
00:05:11,216 --> 00:05:12,997
Your audition is in two days.

104
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:14,960
Is there anything
I can get you?

105
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,289
- I'm gonna make you something to eat.
- I'm fine!

106
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:20,563
She didn't have breakfast
this morning. No appetite.

107
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:22,914
Something
was upsetting her.

108
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,779
Maybe it was you.

109
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,509
How long are you going to
be staying with the Tragers?

110
00:05:27,609 --> 00:05:29,262
As long as she wants to.

111
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:31,649
It's turned into
a regular orphanage.

112
00:05:35,378 --> 00:05:36,961
You look really pale.

113
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,500
So, is this how it's gonna be now,

114
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:44,127
the two of you
rushing over to protect me?

115
00:05:44,227 --> 00:05:47,167
Maybe we wouldn't have to if you were
capable of taking care of yourself.

116
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,348
- I can take care of myself.
- I know that.

117
00:05:50,523 --> 00:05:51,416
Thanks.

118
00:05:51,516 --> 00:05:53,033
You can go home now.

119
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:55,200
Yes, I'll go back
to our house.

120
00:05:55,871 --> 00:05:57,406
I hope you feel better.

121
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:04,213
- She means well.
- Does she?

122
00:06:05,013 --> 00:06:06,764
Honestly, Kyle, I am preparing

123
00:06:06,864 --> 00:06:08,700
for the most important
concert of my life.

124
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,524
The thought of you two
living together...

125
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:11,700
It's not like that.

126
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,851
She needs a place to live,
a family.

127
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:14,887
I know...

128
00:06:16,374 --> 00:06:18,227
You're the only one for me.

129
00:06:18,874 --> 00:06:20,926
There's nothing to worry about.

130
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:26,637
Now go home.

131
00:06:27,272 --> 00:06:28,778
Seriously, I have to practice.

132
00:06:28,878 --> 00:06:32,093
If I'm not absolutely perfect I won't
be able to win that scholarship,

133
00:06:32,193 --> 00:06:35,722
which, as my mom keeps reminding me,
is the only way I'm paying for college.

134
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,256
Want me to stay and listen?

135
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:38,790
You'll distract me.

136
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,304
Go home.

137
00:06:59,793 --> 00:07:01,806
Amanda's concentration's just off.

138
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:03,681
Don't worry, she'll get it back.

139
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:05,929
I don't know.
It's not like her.

140
00:07:06,168 --> 00:07:07,129
It's nerves.

141
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,719
It happens to everybody.
Trust me.

142
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:13,648
Last year I couldn't hit an outside shot
for three straight games.

143
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:15,726
Suddenly, I'm nailing every one.

144
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:20,147
I just wish Jessi could have
moved in after the concert.

145
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,458
Right, hottie in the house. Of course
your girlfriend's freaking out.

146
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:26,114
I have to keep reassuring Amanda

147
00:07:26,214 --> 00:07:28,373
while trying to make Jessi
feel more comfortable.

148
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:31,305
Sounds like a high-class
problem to me, dude.

149
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:33,770
High-class?
I want them both to be happy.

150
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,575
Sorry, I've got no advice when
it comes to managing women.

151
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:39,167
I think my current situation
speaks for itself.

152
00:07:41,449 --> 00:07:42,428
So, is...

153
00:07:43,068 --> 00:07:44,869
Lori seeing that Mark guy now?

154
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:47,491
Stephen told her he was off limits.

155
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:51,011
Like that's not gonna drive her
straight to him.

156
00:07:59,214 --> 00:08:01,796
Are you slumming
in college town now?

157
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:03,969
I'm just passing through.

158
00:08:04,302 --> 00:08:05,345
Really?

159
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:06,823
Sure. I mean,

160
00:08:07,129 --> 00:08:09,656
I know we're not allowed
to go out with each other, but,

161
00:08:09,756 --> 00:08:12,554
as far as I know there's no
rule against accidental run-ins.

162
00:08:12,654 --> 00:08:14,162
Is that what this is?

163
00:08:14,546 --> 00:08:17,980
A hundred percent purely
accidental run-in. Scout's honor.

164
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,528
I don't know. Something tells me
you weren't a Girl Scout.

165
00:08:20,628 --> 00:08:22,209
Not even remotely.

166
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,321
It is nice,
accidentally running into you.

167
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:28,728
Would you like to do it
again here tomorrow?

168
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:30,695
See, now you're pushing it.

169
00:08:31,456 --> 00:08:32,650
Is that a yes?

170
00:08:34,525 --> 00:08:36,788
Well, it's not like
you can prevent an accident.

171
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:39,177
- Do you want a ride?
- How about another game?

172
00:08:39,277 --> 00:08:42,920
They're both gonna be there, Kyle,
no matter what time you get home.

173
00:08:43,894 --> 00:08:44,992
I'll walk.

174
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:47,584
- Thanks.
- Later.

175
00:08:55,846 --> 00:08:57,284
Somebody likes you.

176
00:09:00,138 --> 00:09:00,888
Here.

177
00:09:01,948 --> 00:09:04,332
What's wrong,
not a big fan of the canine?

178
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,212
It's not the dog
I have a problem with.

179
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,900
Look, I want to apologize.

180
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,896
Okay?

181
00:09:11,622 --> 00:09:13,583
We could have handled
things a lot better.

182
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:15,897
I told them. I said,
"If we want to make

183
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:17,743
a good first impression then

184
00:09:17,843 --> 00:09:20,039
abducting you and your girlfriend,

185
00:09:20,139 --> 00:09:22,088
probably not the best way to go."

186
00:09:22,474 --> 00:09:24,748
You're lucky no one called the police.

187
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:26,009
Could have.

188
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,490
Wouldn't have found anything.
Our membership is very exclusive.

189
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:31,688
Careful.

190
00:09:32,346 --> 00:09:34,907
I'd like to keep things
just between us.

191
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:38,363
Kyle, hang on.

192
00:09:39,796 --> 00:09:41,103
Can we start over?

193
00:09:45,364 --> 00:09:46,485
Who are you?

194
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:48,844
Michael Cassidy.

195
00:09:49,927 --> 00:09:51,265
What do you want?

196
00:09:53,378 --> 00:09:54,978
Okay, to put it bluntly,

197
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:57,438
you are our greatest achievement.

198
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:00,245
And we want to make sure
we have a relationship with you.

199
00:10:00,345 --> 00:10:02,179
A relationship to do what?

200
00:10:03,518 --> 00:10:05,126
Anything and everything.

201
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:07,756
Come see what we are about.

202
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:10,652
We are making state of the art advances
in science and technology.

203
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:11,495
Right.

204
00:10:12,193 --> 00:10:15,435
A group of visionaries and
humanitarians. Scientists.

205
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,607
No, mate.

206
00:10:16,707 --> 00:10:18,246
I don't have the smarts.

207
00:10:18,346 --> 00:10:19,993
I'm more of a front man.

208
00:10:20,341 --> 00:10:23,038
Scientists,
terrible social skills.

209
00:10:24,247 --> 00:10:26,869
Anyway, they sent me to convince
you to give us

210
00:10:26,969 --> 00:10:28,230
a second chance.

211
00:10:28,578 --> 00:10:30,527
Let us show you we're the good guys.

212
00:10:33,623 --> 00:10:36,862
- I'm not interested.
- I'm hoping you'll change your mind.

213
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:40,983
Humor me.

214
00:11:01,672 --> 00:11:03,895
You've been
a very bad girl, Amber.

215
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,158
Haven't you?

216
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:10,411
Dad!

217
00:11:10,511 --> 00:11:11,989
What the hell are you doing?

218
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:13,984
I mean, I know
what you're doing but

219
00:11:14,084 --> 00:11:15,585
what the hell are you doing?

220
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:17,389
I'm sorry.

221
00:11:17,489 --> 00:11:18,648
I'm going crazy.

222
00:11:18,748 --> 00:11:21,231
Andy's been out of town
and you know, I miss her.

223
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:24,486
I get that you miss your
girlfriend but this is not okay.

224
00:11:24,586 --> 00:11:27,510
When the bill for this program
comes in, you're paying for it.

225
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,351
Is there a charge?

226
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,097
I unscrambled the channel.

227
00:11:33,505 --> 00:11:34,967
Why would you do that?

228
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:36,405
Josh asked me to.

229
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,159
Grounded for a week?

230
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:39,960
Two.

231
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,028
Nark.

232
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,325
Dude, you gotta
do something about Jessi.

233
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:58,658
She can't keep a secret for 5 minutes.
She totally ratted me out to Dad.

234
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:00,760
She's not used
to living with a family.

235
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,662
Remember when I first
moved in here?

236
00:12:02,762 --> 00:12:05,672
I told Stephen I took that test
for you, but you forgave me.

237
00:12:05,772 --> 00:12:06,966
Give her time.

238
00:12:08,006 --> 00:12:08,867
Well...

239
00:12:09,906 --> 00:12:13,176
She did provide me with
a fairly excellent dose of porn.

240
00:12:13,863 --> 00:12:16,104
You really miss Andy, don't you?

241
00:12:18,277 --> 00:12:19,906
I thought I was thirsty before.

242
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,141
But now that I've had my first taste...

243
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:25,327
With her gone,
I'm totally dehydrated.

244
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:29,230
So, Andy's a drink
that doesn't quench your thirst?

245
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,476
No, she does.

246
00:12:30,934 --> 00:12:31,826
She did.

247
00:12:32,117 --> 00:12:35,046
It's just... Since we went
there, to that place,

248
00:12:35,251 --> 00:12:37,845
I'm going crazy.
That's all I think about.

249
00:12:38,442 --> 00:12:40,943
You had that accidental run-in
with Jessi in the bathroom.

250
00:12:41,043 --> 00:12:42,654
Why aren't you messed up?

251
00:12:42,948 --> 00:12:44,539
Why would I be messed up?

252
00:12:45,289 --> 00:12:46,499
You saw her boobs

253
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,392
and they're right downstairs.

254
00:12:50,706 --> 00:12:51,673
Both of them.

255
00:12:52,581 --> 00:12:53,897
I love Amanda.

256
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,657
She's my soul mate.

257
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:01,079
<i>Your soul mate?
That's intense.</i>

258
00:13:01,179 --> 00:13:03,074
<i>I felt it from the first time
I saw her.</i>

259
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:04,559
<i>We just</i>

260
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:05,843
<i>connected,</i>

261
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:08,488
<i>as if we were meant
to meet each other.</i>

262
00:13:08,782 --> 00:13:11,079
<i>Amanda's always been
the one for me.</i>

263
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,876
You still haven't gotten it right.

264
00:13:42,976 --> 00:13:45,456
Coming in every second isn't helping.

265
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,768
Great. Broke a string.

266
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:05,529
I keep messing up in the same place.
It's like I can't hold

267
00:14:05,629 --> 00:14:08,121
the piece in my head.
That's never happened before.

268
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:09,814
You'll get it. You always do.

269
00:14:09,914 --> 00:14:12,238
What if I don't?
I need this scholarship.

270
00:14:13,664 --> 00:14:14,422
Done.

271
00:14:15,974 --> 00:14:18,381
It's like I'm carrying this
stress in the back of my neck.

272
00:14:18,481 --> 00:14:19,666
Here, let me.

273
00:14:26,856 --> 00:14:28,027
Feels good.

274
00:14:28,127 --> 00:14:28,930
Good.

275
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:33,125
It's been one thing
after another lately.

276
00:14:33,225 --> 00:14:35,683
- What do you mean?
- First the headaches,

277
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:38,802
now this pain in my neck.
Forgetting my music...

278
00:14:38,902 --> 00:14:41,358
- You're just nervous.
- I guess

279
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:47,041
You know, now that I think
about it, I just...

280
00:14:47,141 --> 00:14:49,449
... haven't felt like myself
since prom.

281
00:14:52,756 --> 00:14:54,743
We know that Latnok
sedated her.

282
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,312
It must have been
a very strong dose.

283
00:14:57,515 --> 00:15:00,997
So strong that she's still having
side effects two weeks later?

284
00:15:01,097 --> 00:15:03,939
- Why is there pain in her neck?
- Stress?

285
00:15:04,039 --> 00:15:07,197
- She's nervous about her concert.
- What if it's more than that?

286
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:09,243
What if they did
something to her?

287
00:15:09,343 --> 00:15:11,512
Kyle, I think
you're being paranoid.

288
00:15:12,352 --> 00:15:13,604
They kidnapped us!

289
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:17,399
It was all a sick game. Who knows
what else they're capable of?

290
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:20,655
Let's say you're right,
they did something.

291
00:15:21,381 --> 00:15:22,361
Now what?

292
00:15:24,678 --> 00:15:27,382
Amanda keeps getting stuck
at the same place in her music.

293
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:30,971
As if her memory's misfiring.
It could be neurological.

294
00:15:32,124 --> 00:15:35,141
Well, it's not like you can just
scan her brain to find out.

295
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:40,080
Okay. You could
figure out a way.

296
00:15:40,754 --> 00:15:43,354
This never would have happened
if it weren't for me.

297
00:15:43,454 --> 00:15:45,767
I have to make sure
she's all right.

298
00:15:47,892 --> 00:15:50,170
Anything for
your precious Amanda.

299
00:15:55,158 --> 00:15:56,782
Fancy meeting you here.

300
00:15:56,882 --> 00:15:58,723
What a wonderful coincidence.

301
00:16:04,961 --> 00:16:05,910
For me?

302
00:16:06,546 --> 00:16:10,286
I just like to keep them on hand
in case of accidental run-ins.

303
00:16:11,306 --> 00:16:12,815
That's so nice of you.

304
00:16:13,748 --> 00:16:15,583
Why do you sound so surprised?

305
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,319
No, it's just, people don't
buy me flowers very often.

306
00:16:19,786 --> 00:16:22,480
Well, then you've been dating
the wrong people.

307
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,933
I mean accidentally running into
the wrong people.

308
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:30,033
We're really doing this,
aren't we?

309
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,093
I'm willing to take the risk.

310
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,346
I mean, that's assuming
that you want to.

311
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,087
I took three buses
just to get here.

312
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,042
Of course I do.

313
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:45,089
It's just never been
this easy before.

314
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,425
No games, it's so direct. Just...

315
00:16:50,002 --> 00:16:51,009
honesty.

316
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,244
Well... No.
It's not easy.

317
00:16:59,967 --> 00:17:01,525
I mean, we're being bad.

318
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:04,197
Secretive.
Downright duplicitous.

319
00:17:04,297 --> 00:17:05,554
We are so evil.

320
00:17:07,017 --> 00:17:09,410
Would you care
to be evil over pizza?

321
00:17:10,835 --> 00:17:12,146
I would love to.

322
00:17:21,235 --> 00:17:23,118
Best accidental run-in ever.

323
00:17:33,743 --> 00:17:36,866
- Is that what happened to my Xbox?
- I needed to wire this controller.

324
00:17:36,966 --> 00:17:40,609
- What do I get out of this deal?
- Knowing that you helped Amanda.

325
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:42,428
That's no reward for me, either.

326
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,642
Do you see her? I need to install this
scanner under the piano.

327
00:17:45,742 --> 00:17:47,664
I don't want her to see us.

328
00:17:47,764 --> 00:17:50,638
Oh, yes, you know,
that would be terrible.

329
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:52,106
You wanted to help.

330
00:17:52,206 --> 00:17:53,631
I'm here, aren't I?

331
00:17:53,731 --> 00:17:55,948
Amanda's next.
Better fire up that scanner thingy.

332
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:57,884
Find a place backstage
for the receiver.

333
00:17:57,984 --> 00:18:00,211
- What should I do?
- Make sure we don't get caught.

334
00:18:00,311 --> 00:18:01,090
Right.

335
00:18:03,812 --> 00:18:06,584
Excuse me.
Are you a performer?

336
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,038
Performers only in the stage area.

337
00:18:09,138 --> 00:18:10,820
- But I'm just...
- Who are you?

338
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,983
I'm sorry, but you're not
allowed to be here.

339
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:14,846
- Please leave.
- Oh, my God!

340
00:18:14,946 --> 00:18:16,702
This is the wrong piece!

341
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:21,257
This is Tchaikovsky and
I wanted Spandus Strapopovich.

342
00:18:21,837 --> 00:18:23,542
Mother! Where are you?

343
00:18:23,924 --> 00:18:26,025
How could you do this to me?
I hate you!

344
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,090
- Young man...
- Are you in charge here?

345
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,362
- I am.
- This is completely unacceptable.

346
00:18:30,462 --> 00:18:32,244
You need to come with me.

347
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:39,547
What are you doing here?

348
00:18:41,392 --> 00:18:42,644
Wishing you luck.

349
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:44,682
It's a closed rehearsal.

350
00:18:44,782 --> 00:18:46,155
And I need to focus.

351
00:18:46,993 --> 00:18:48,454
Okay. Well, then...

352
00:18:48,888 --> 00:18:49,848
good luck.

353
00:19:24,002 --> 00:19:26,748
- The device is working perfectly.
- Great.

354
00:19:30,823 --> 00:19:32,345
We make a good team.

355
00:19:33,083 --> 00:19:34,559
Thanks for helping.

356
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:06,064
- Leave me alone.
- Amanda, I just want to help.

357
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,820
By showing up with your housemate?

358
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,005
You know how that makes me feel,
especially now.

359
00:20:10,105 --> 00:20:12,451
- I shouldn't have brought her.
- No, you shouldn't have

360
00:20:12,551 --> 00:20:14,966
But somehow,
she's always around, helping.

361
00:20:16,657 --> 00:20:18,275
Let me ask you something.

362
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:19,126
What?

363
00:20:19,404 --> 00:20:20,449
That night,

364
00:20:20,549 --> 00:20:22,685
after prom,
when you went looking for me...

365
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:23,488
Yes?

366
00:20:23,886 --> 00:20:25,085
Was Jessi there?

367
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:28,582
- Why would you think...
- Just answer the question.

368
00:20:29,377 --> 00:20:31,366
Jessi helped me find you, yes.

369
00:20:31,891 --> 00:20:32,768
I knew it.

370
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:35,441
Look, I know that night
must seem very strange.

371
00:20:35,541 --> 00:20:38,046
Strange? It's this big
giant question mark,

372
00:20:38,146 --> 00:20:40,658
and now that I know she was
there it makes it all even worse.

373
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:43,264
- Wherever you go, she goes.
- I know it may seem that way...

374
00:20:43,364 --> 00:20:44,812
No, that's how it is!

375
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,857
And honestly, Kyle, I can't take it!

376
00:20:46,957 --> 00:20:49,623
I've got to nail this audition
and I can't be worrying about

377
00:20:49,723 --> 00:20:52,396
what is and what is not going on with
the two of you all the time.

378
00:20:52,496 --> 00:20:54,422
- I just can't!
- There's nothing going on.

379
00:20:54,522 --> 00:20:56,999
Then maybe you could try
not spending every second with her!

380
00:20:57,099 --> 00:20:58,479
See how that goes.

381
00:21:20,907 --> 00:21:23,950
Oh, cool. You got it to read
the data from the rehearsal.

382
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,648
This is all
of Amanda's brain activity.

383
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:29,258
- Were you up all night?
- Not all night.

384
00:21:29,502 --> 00:21:30,952
Maybe most of it.

385
00:21:31,052 --> 00:21:33,650
You know, you could have
used your computer.

386
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,499
It wouldn't have bothered me.

387
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:36,804
This one's fine.

388
00:21:39,267 --> 00:21:42,781
Well, call out the numbers.
I'll input them in the program.

389
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,790
I should do this by myself.

390
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:46,293
Why?

391
00:21:47,199 --> 00:21:48,157
It's just...

392
00:21:50,307 --> 00:21:53,218
maybe you should go see
what everybody else is up to.

393
00:21:53,911 --> 00:21:55,618
It's Amanda, right?

394
00:21:56,456 --> 00:21:57,476
She hates me.

395
00:21:58,212 --> 00:21:59,843
She doesn't hate you.

396
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:02,199
She just thinks that we spend
too much time together.

397
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:04,799
- I've only been trying to help.
- I know.

398
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,973
But she doesn't know the real story,
so it looks different to her.

399
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:13,585
It must be hard, being with someone
when you have to keep so many secrets.

400
00:22:14,598 --> 00:22:15,481
It is.

401
00:22:15,581 --> 00:22:17,719
I wish I could
tell her everything.

402
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,768
Then why don't you?

403
00:22:20,798 --> 00:22:22,866
I think about
how worried she'd be.

404
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:26,186
Who knows how much more danger
I'd be putting her in.

405
00:22:26,453 --> 00:22:30,513
I feel like she'd be more protected
if she didn't know the whole truth.

406
00:22:32,042 --> 00:22:33,696
I know the whole truth.

407
00:22:34,231 --> 00:22:36,939
Thankfully, you can
take care of yourself.

408
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,919
Yeah, I guess.

409
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:45,430
Oh, my God.
There's something there.

410
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:48,166
You were right.

411
00:22:49,846 --> 00:22:52,034
They put something
in her brain.

412
00:22:57,428 --> 00:22:59,377
- What did you do to Amanda?
- What?

413
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:02,198
- You put something in her head.
- Kyle, you're being really...

414
00:23:02,298 --> 00:23:03,926
Tell me what it is.

415
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:08,845
Okay. It's something new
we've developed. It's safe.

416
00:23:09,358 --> 00:23:12,278
Instead of typical sedative you
use an nanoscopic neuro-blocker.

417
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:14,418
Attaches itself to the receptors
on the brain stem.

418
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,753
Why would you do that?

419
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:18,002
So she wouldn't remember
anything from that night.

420
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:20,243
- It should have dissolved.
- Well, it hasn't.

421
00:23:20,343 --> 00:23:22,384
She's having side effects
and I need to get it out.

422
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:24,629
We can't get it out.
But we might be able

423
00:23:24,729 --> 00:23:26,285
- to disintegrate it.
- We?

424
00:23:26,385 --> 00:23:27,979
You mean Latnok?

425
00:23:28,546 --> 00:23:29,741
I'd like to help.

426
00:23:33,339 --> 00:23:36,329
Kyle, don't try anything
on your own. You could hurt her.

427
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:39,515
- Let me make a phone call.
- You've done enough.

428
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:46,111
Hilary, where are you
when I need you?

429
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:50,249
Where are you off to?

430
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,973
Amanda's concert?

431
00:23:56,505 --> 00:23:59,069
Crap. You can totally tell
when I'm lying, huh?

432
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:01,272
Just like Kyle.

433
00:24:02,504 --> 00:24:04,194
You're going to meet Mark.

434
00:24:05,168 --> 00:24:06,019
Listen...

435
00:24:08,097 --> 00:24:09,943
Let me break it down for you.

436
00:24:11,465 --> 00:24:14,189
When it comes to living in this house,
I know we all gather round

437
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:16,859
the kitchen island and yuk it up
and we're all smiles and hugs

438
00:24:16,959 --> 00:24:20,199
and touching moments,
but underneath, it is us versus them.

439
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,342
Everyone under legal voting age

440
00:24:22,442 --> 00:24:24,798
is honor-bound to keep each
other's secrets.

441
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,674
- Well, I can keep a secret.
- Great.

442
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:33,246
- That's it?
- As long as you don't rat me out

443
00:24:33,346 --> 00:24:35,364
- to Mom and Dad, you're in.
- I won't.

444
00:24:35,643 --> 00:24:37,220
- Fine.
- Good.

445
00:24:40,766 --> 00:24:42,839
You know, you should
wear your hair down.

446
00:24:43,448 --> 00:24:45,608
Long healthy hair helps signal
a prospective male

447
00:24:45,776 --> 00:24:47,360
to your reproductive potential.

448
00:24:49,406 --> 00:24:52,240
Okay, thanks.
That's good to know.

449
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,266
How's it going, man?

450
00:25:07,019 --> 00:25:08,980
Good, man. Really good.

451
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:12,252
I'm close to a breakthrough on
the three dimensional algorithm.

452
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,258
Glad to hear it.

453
00:25:14,629 --> 00:25:15,629
Look.

454
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,815
I heard through the grapevine you've
been spending time with Lori Trager.

455
00:25:25,381 --> 00:25:26,794
I guess.

456
00:25:27,258 --> 00:25:28,943
She's a great girl.

457
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:30,680
No doubt.

458
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:32,491
But...

459
00:25:33,774 --> 00:25:35,893
you know how we like
to keep things confidential.

460
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:38,452
And...

461
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:41,614
Our goal is to get our guy
back in the fold.

462
00:25:42,129 --> 00:25:44,556
You were never supposed
to make contact with his sister.

463
00:25:45,031 --> 00:25:47,619
I know. We met by accident.

464
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:50,237
It was just a...
I'll keep things separate.

465
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:52,184
I mean, we're just hanging out.

466
00:25:52,988 --> 00:25:54,338
Not anymore.

467
00:25:59,393 --> 00:26:02,136
- Jessi, hey!
- Your pants are down.

468
00:26:02,236 --> 00:26:03,898
Oh, look at that.

469
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,672
What are you doing?

470
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,259
I... was just thinking of...

471
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:10,511
- Hey, she's pretty.
- Don't look at that!

472
00:26:14,062 --> 00:26:15,198
Are you okay?

473
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:17,241
Knee...

474
00:26:17,516 --> 00:26:18,609
broken.

475
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,083
Leave.

476
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:22,872
Out!

477
00:26:32,029 --> 00:26:34,341
Good. I need your help
figuring this out.

478
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:36,640
I thought you couldn't
be seen with me.

479
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,346
I don't have time for that.

480
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,116
What we saw is a neuro-block
which hasn't been dissolved.

481
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:45,673
It's keeping Amanda's memory of what
to play from getting to her fingers.

482
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:48,925
But I think I can eliminate it
with an electrical charge.

483
00:26:49,966 --> 00:26:52,234
How do I do it
without electrocuting her?

484
00:26:52,334 --> 00:26:54,528
That's a risk
I'd be willing to take.

485
00:26:56,337 --> 00:26:58,513
I know.
You don't have time for this.

486
00:27:02,095 --> 00:27:03,713
- That's Amanda's head?
- Right.

487
00:27:03,813 --> 00:27:04,919
It's empty.

488
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:06,899
You don't have to be here.

489
00:27:06,999 --> 00:27:09,506
Except this is my room now.

490
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:13,258
I have to regulate the voltage
and apply the right amount

491
00:27:13,358 --> 00:27:15,909
to disintegrate the block.
But without hurting her.

492
00:27:25,483 --> 00:27:27,140
- That's not enough.
- I know.

493
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,019
You need more power
if you want it to work.

494
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:31,168
I know.
Let me concentrate.

495
00:27:38,754 --> 00:27:39,682
That's it.

496
00:27:40,888 --> 00:27:42,053
You're doing it.

497
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,107
More.

498
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:46,074
More.

499
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:48,982
More.

500
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:51,405
More.

501
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,869
I think I need to touch Amanda

502
00:28:03,969 --> 00:28:06,085
to control the electrical flow
more precisely.

503
00:28:06,766 --> 00:28:08,673
She'll feel it and
know what you're doing.

504
00:28:08,773 --> 00:28:10,444
Not if I can distract her.

505
00:28:10,544 --> 00:28:12,248
While you're zapping her?

506
00:28:13,611 --> 00:28:14,962
Does someone want to explain

507
00:28:15,062 --> 00:28:17,251
why my laptop just fried
like my brain on drugs?

508
00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:19,054
I must have caused a power surge.

509
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:20,837
Sorry. I'll fix it later.

510
00:28:20,937 --> 00:28:24,459
Later not so good for me. I was
in the middle of something important.

511
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:26,177
Charlotte Cam Live.

512
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:28,081
See, it's you.

513
00:28:28,403 --> 00:28:29,796
You are the problem.

514
00:28:29,896 --> 00:28:32,835
Eavesdropping, barging in without
knocking, blowing out electricity.

515
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,761
- That was me.
- Fine.

516
00:28:34,861 --> 00:28:36,323
Then you get the assist.

517
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:39,085
I can't take it anymore.
I can't get a minute alone.

518
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:41,250
Why don't you go
somewhere else, then?

519
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,337
Because this is my house!

520
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:44,680
Not yours!

521
00:28:49,203 --> 00:28:50,978
Does he think I don't know that?

522
00:28:52,696 --> 00:28:54,871
When I first moved in,
nobody wanted me here

523
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:56,366
except for Nicole.

524
00:28:56,995 --> 00:28:59,170
But I had nowhere else to go.

525
00:28:59,984 --> 00:29:02,974
They'll come around.
It'll just take time.

526
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:06,077
How much time
before Josh isn't mad at me?

527
00:29:07,369 --> 00:29:09,410
Probably until
Andy comes back tonight.

528
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,936
A welcome home kiss from her,
he'll forget why he's upset.

529
00:29:12,036 --> 00:29:14,585
- Kyle, that's it!
- What?

530
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:17,724
How you can help Amanda without
her knowing what you're doing.

531
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:20,208
Pass the electricity
through a kiss.

532
00:29:20,308 --> 00:29:23,375
I won't know how much power to give her.
If I'm wrong I'll electrocute her.

533
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,025
Then you'll have to practice.

534
00:29:27,334 --> 00:29:28,592
On what?

535
00:29:29,417 --> 00:29:30,117
Me.

536
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:34,878
Are you all charged up?

537
00:29:44,412 --> 00:29:45,366
Ready?

538
00:29:56,902 --> 00:29:58,892
- Either of you seen Lori?
- No.

539
00:29:59,511 --> 00:30:00,906
She's been out all day.

540
00:30:01,658 --> 00:30:04,349
- Did she say anything to you?
- Nothing at all.

541
00:30:07,936 --> 00:30:09,214
What was that?

542
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:11,327
What was what?

543
00:30:11,523 --> 00:30:14,781
You just gave her a look. That was your
"I know you're lying" look.

544
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,444
I don't have that look.

545
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,847
Did Lori ask you to lie?

546
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:25,072
I knew it. She's with Mark.

547
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:35,128
There you are.

548
00:30:35,228 --> 00:30:37,901
I thought you ran off
with a girl your own age.

549
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,630
I'm sorry. I got held up.

550
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:44,215
Lucky for you
I'm not high maintenance.

551
00:30:44,431 --> 00:30:46,354
Do you want me to come to you?

552
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:48,945
Listen, Lori...

553
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:54,994
I don't even know
how to say this.

554
00:30:56,344 --> 00:30:58,901
Is this the part
where it's not easy anymore?

555
00:31:00,886 --> 00:31:02,761
Look, my future's really
important to me

556
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,733
- and I don't want to jeopardize it.
- I got it.

557
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:08,640
Now, Lori, come on.
This isn't about you.

558
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,732
Mark, I said I got it.

559
00:31:10,832 --> 00:31:12,828
And now I'm going to hang up.

560
00:31:13,224 --> 00:31:15,997
- Look, I'm sorry.
- Goodbye.

561
00:31:45,105 --> 00:31:47,821
- This is weird.
- It's science.

562
00:31:48,188 --> 00:31:50,324
I know, but I've never
kissed you before.

563
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,628
- You've seen me naked.
- You're not helping.

564
00:31:53,855 --> 00:31:54,762
Sorry.

565
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:02,294
I shouldn't be kissing anyone
other than Amanda.

566
00:32:03,814 --> 00:32:04,670
Fine.

567
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:06,247
Go kiss Amanda.

568
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:08,483
Give her your best guess
about the voltage.

569
00:32:08,583 --> 00:32:10,792
Maybe you'll be right
and you won't kill her.

570
00:32:16,504 --> 00:32:17,309
Sorry.

571
00:32:19,213 --> 00:32:20,862
You need more practice.

572
00:32:26,295 --> 00:32:26,995
Hi.

573
00:32:27,102 --> 00:32:29,663
- I think Kyle's in his room.
- Actually, I wanted to see you.

574
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:31,701
But if you're on your way
out the door...

575
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,325
That's okay. Please.

576
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:40,014
I was hoping you could teach me
some relaxation techniques.

577
00:32:40,114 --> 00:32:41,760
You nervous about
the concert tonight?

578
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,526
The entire scholarship committee
from U-Dub is gonna be there.

579
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:46,176
Watching and judging.

580
00:32:46,707 --> 00:32:48,757
I haven't been able to get
through the piece in weeks

581
00:32:48,857 --> 00:32:50,278
and my mom's all over me.

582
00:32:50,378 --> 00:32:53,676
Sometimes parents don't realize
the pressure they're adding.

583
00:32:54,036 --> 00:32:55,332
It's not just her.

584
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:56,868
I'm off my game.

585
00:32:57,204 --> 00:32:59,106
It's not the easiest thing
in the world to have

586
00:32:59,206 --> 00:33:01,218
Kyle and Jessi
living under the same roof.

587
00:33:01,318 --> 00:33:04,335
I can see how that would bother
you, but you can trust Kyle.

588
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:06,111
I know.

589
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:09,576
I guess I don't trust her.

590
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:11,616
Is that awful?

591
00:33:13,211 --> 00:33:16,118
Amanda, you and Kyle have
a very special connection.

592
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:18,761
He would never do
anything to hurt you.

593
00:33:20,843 --> 00:33:21,832
Trust that.

594
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,279
I don't want to hurt you again.

595
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,570
I can take it.

596
00:33:28,353 --> 00:33:29,966
Maybe if I touched you.

597
00:33:30,223 --> 00:33:32,067
Use my hands
to complete a circuit,

598
00:33:32,167 --> 00:33:34,133
any extra current
will flow back through me.

599
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:35,633
It's worth a shot.

600
00:33:36,011 --> 00:33:38,207
Do you have enough
charge left to try again?

601
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:39,329
I think so.

602
00:33:46,085 --> 00:33:47,111
How's that?

603
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,631
That's not bad.

604
00:33:51,959 --> 00:33:52,853
I feel

605
00:33:53,259 --> 00:33:54,035
warm.

606
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,191
It tingles a little.

607
00:33:59,645 --> 00:34:00,791
Are you ready?

608
00:34:01,751 --> 00:34:03,833
Just try to be gentle.

609
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:10,481
I can hear your heart beating.

610
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:12,533
Yours, too.

611
00:34:30,756 --> 00:34:31,826
Amanda, wait.

612
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:35,767
- Let me explain.
- You are always trying to explain!

613
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:37,441
Explaining why you keep secrets,

614
00:34:37,541 --> 00:34:40,014
explaining why you didn't tell me
what happened on prom night.

615
00:34:40,114 --> 00:34:42,441
But there is no explanation
for why you were kissing Jessi!

616
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,353
There is.

617
00:34:43,453 --> 00:34:45,142
I'll tell you everything.

618
00:34:45,242 --> 00:34:47,707
I don't even care anymore,
because none of it matters.

619
00:34:47,807 --> 00:34:49,191
It does matter.

620
00:34:49,522 --> 00:34:52,047
It'll help you understand why
all of this is happening.

621
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:55,787
The only person who doesn't understand
what is happening is you.

622
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,171
Please.

623
00:34:57,812 --> 00:34:59,456
I'm late for my recital.

624
00:35:08,552 --> 00:35:09,890
I've ruined it.

625
00:35:11,754 --> 00:35:13,036
I've ruined us.

626
00:35:16,343 --> 00:35:17,886
I'm so sorry, Kyle.

627
00:35:21,087 --> 00:35:24,561
She's gonna get to that section of the
music and she won't be able to play it.

628
00:35:24,661 --> 00:35:26,225
I can't let that happen.

629
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,937
I have to help her.

630
00:35:28,037 --> 00:35:30,266
Is there any other way
than kissing her?

631
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:37,342
Then I guess
you have to go make it right.

632
00:35:41,445 --> 00:35:42,612
Thanks, Jessi.

633
00:36:06,482 --> 00:36:07,570
Comfortable?

634
00:36:08,627 --> 00:36:10,210
I need to clear my head.

635
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,346
The tub always works for Kyle.

636
00:36:12,682 --> 00:36:16,189
I thought you'd be with Andy.
Isn't tonight the big homecoming?

637
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:19,885
Her mom's extended their vacation
rental for another three weeks.

638
00:36:20,393 --> 00:36:21,262
Sweetie.

639
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:22,859
I'm sorry.

640
00:36:26,521 --> 00:36:28,281
I know you're frustrated.

641
00:36:29,308 --> 00:36:31,030
I just want to see her.

642
00:36:32,521 --> 00:36:33,736
I thought it was for

643
00:36:33,836 --> 00:36:35,527
you konw, other reasons,

644
00:36:35,965 --> 00:36:38,396
but today I got all mad
at Kyle and Jessi

645
00:36:38,652 --> 00:36:41,646
and all I could think of
was telling Andy about it.

646
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,007
I just

647
00:36:44,771 --> 00:36:45,892
really miss her.

648
00:36:49,085 --> 00:36:50,589
The Jessi thing,

649
00:36:51,158 --> 00:36:53,031
you know it's not gonna be easy, right?

650
00:36:53,131 --> 00:36:56,062
<i>I know we all got used to Kyle
and that turned out great.</i>

651
00:36:56,162 --> 00:36:58,404
<i>I just hope we can get used to her.</i>

652
00:36:59,694 --> 00:37:00,653
<i>So do I.</i>

653
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,603
Is everything okay?

654
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:04,849
Fine.

655
00:37:08,995 --> 00:37:11,506
You've been gone a while.
Do anything exciting?

656
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:13,188
Not really, no.

657
00:37:13,447 --> 00:37:16,303
How about I phrase it this way.
See anyone exciting?

658
00:37:16,403 --> 00:37:18,810
Actually, no, Dad, I didn't.
And thank you, Jessi.

659
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,614
I knew you couldn't keep
your mouth shut.

660
00:37:20,714 --> 00:37:22,265
Jessi didn't have
to say a word.

661
00:37:22,365 --> 00:37:24,867
I'm sure she was
a real pillar of secrecy.

662
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,639
I'll just go.

663
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,397
This isn't her fault.

664
00:37:30,703 --> 00:37:32,181
Oh, that's good. Stick up for her.

665
00:37:32,281 --> 00:37:34,091
Let's see how else
you can destroy my day.

666
00:37:34,191 --> 00:37:35,844
I didn't destroy your day.

667
00:37:35,944 --> 00:37:37,930
No? Because it was
going pretty well

668
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:41,242
until Mark told me he won't date me
because he's afraid of his future.

669
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,694
Good. He should be.

670
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,665
Why do you get to decide who
I can and can't go out with?

671
00:37:45,765 --> 00:37:48,163
Because I'm your father
and you live in my house!

672
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:49,907
Real original, Dad.

673
00:37:50,007 --> 00:37:52,401
Does it feel good to be
a walking parental cliché?

674
00:37:52,501 --> 00:37:54,631
You want a cliché?
Go to your room!

675
00:38:05,163 --> 00:38:07,013
You are not allowed back here.

676
00:38:07,113 --> 00:38:08,216
I need to see her.

677
00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:09,901
I don't know what you did to her,

678
00:38:10,001 --> 00:38:12,181
but my daughter is back there
crying her eyes out.

679
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:14,799
- I've never seen her like this.
- I can help her.

680
00:38:14,899 --> 00:38:17,524
- Please.
- Don't you think you've done enough?

681
00:38:21,143 --> 00:38:22,264
Keep him out.

682
00:39:18,526 --> 00:39:20,198
Two minutes.

683
00:39:45,673 --> 00:39:47,301
What are you doing here?

684
00:39:47,615 --> 00:39:50,973
I couldn't let you perform without
trying to make things better.

685
00:39:51,073 --> 00:39:52,186
It's just...

686
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:54,942
I feel so sad.

687
00:39:56,782 --> 00:39:58,309
I did this to you.

688
00:39:59,005 --> 00:40:00,508
Amanda, I'm so sorry.

689
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:02,786
I trusted you.

690
00:40:04,016 --> 00:40:05,613
And I broke that trust.

691
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:11,366
I hurt you. I never thought I'd do
anything to hurt you, but I did.

692
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,245
I love you so much, Amanda.

693
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:18,201
I love you, too.

694
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:22,444
That's why it hurts so badly.

695
00:40:24,448 --> 00:40:26,374
It's not that you kissed her.

696
00:40:27,462 --> 00:40:30,288
It's that I can feel what's
happening between you two.

697
00:40:30,602 --> 00:40:33,670
- There's nothing.
- You don't see it. But it's there.

698
00:40:38,790 --> 00:40:40,403
I can't be with you

699
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:43,644
when I know I'm losing you
to someone else.

700
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:46,372
You'll never lose me.

701
00:40:49,891 --> 00:40:51,222
I already have.

702
00:40:54,637 --> 00:40:55,530
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

703
00:40:55,961 --> 00:40:57,268
One minute.

704
00:41:00,275 --> 00:41:01,676
I can't do this.

705
00:41:03,007 --> 00:41:04,486
I can't go out and play.

706
00:41:04,586 --> 00:41:05,958
Let me help you.

707
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,150
I know how to fix your problem.

708
00:41:08,393 --> 00:41:09,262
How?

709
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:13,380
If you have any trust
left for me at all,

710
00:41:14,437 --> 00:41:15,722
let me show you.

711
00:41:46,658 --> 00:41:47,824
You're on.

712
00:41:55,774 --> 00:41:57,723
You have to go now.

713
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,345
<i>Amanda's music
had brought us together.</i>

714
00:42:37,609 --> 00:42:40,662
<i>We had connected that first
time I heard her play.</i>

715
00:42:40,762 --> 00:42:41,663
<i>And now,</i>

716
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:44,611
<i>somehow our connection
had been severed.</i>

717
00:43:06,569 --> 00:43:08,869
<i>Though she had never
played better,</i>

718
00:43:08,969 --> 00:43:12,415
<i>it broke my heart to know that
because of what I had done,</i>

719
00:43:12,515 --> 00:43:14,812
<i>she would be playing on
without me.</i>
