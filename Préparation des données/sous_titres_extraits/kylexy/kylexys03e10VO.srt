1
00:00:00,751 --> 00:00:02,585
<i>Prevously on Kyle XY...</i>

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:04,388
We'll have to start at the beginning.

3
00:00:04,488 --> 00:00:06,740
Einstein spent seven weeks
longer in his mother's womb.

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,124
That's why he was smarter.

5
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:10,775
<i>I worked years developing
an artificial womb.</i>

6
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,463
It was supported by a secret
group known as Latnok.

7
00:00:13,563 --> 00:00:16,182
When you first came here,
everything in the world was new.

8
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:19,185
Adam created me,
but you are my family.

9
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:22,647
I saw you kissing Jessi.
It just wouldn't be appropriate.

10
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,007
It won't happen again.

11
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,844
When you kissed me, I felt such
a rush. Didn't you feel it?

12
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:28,986
My heart says there's
still something there.

13
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:31,903
As much as I want us to be
together, we can't.

14
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,825
<i>- My Mom's changed our plans.
- Josh doesn't know?</i>

15
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,952
This is our last night together.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,872
No heartfelt goodbyes.
Tonight is about you and me.

17
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:44,251
You're going straight to bed.

18
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,629
- Who are you?
- Michael Cassidy.

19
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:48,756
They put enormous pressure
on me to bring you in.

20
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:50,951
They wanted their greatest
achievement on their side.

21
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,360
Why the interest in Cassidy?

22
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,146
I don't like him.
The guy creeps me out.

23
00:00:54,246 --> 00:00:56,290
You know what I would like to
hear about? My mother.

24
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,801
I think it's beholding upon me

25
00:00:57,901 --> 00:01:00,402
to tell you what sort of person
you have living under your roof.

26
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:03,104
<i>After the explosion,
she came across a man camping.</i>

27
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,730
<i>And she killed him.</i>

28
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,649
- Oh, my God.
- It's in her nature.

29
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,444
He murdered my mother.

30
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,923
She knew I was Latnok.
She was gonna kill me.

31
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:15,282
Baylin's experiment...
we're starting it up again.

32
00:01:15,382 --> 00:01:16,435
Sarah found out.

33
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:17,935
I'm already a murderer!

34
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,498
<i>- How did it go at the Rack?
- Just like we wanted.</i>

35
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:25,115
- Kyle's still out there with Cassidy.
- Kyle can handle him.

36
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:27,949
You saved my life. I will take
care of this. Do you trust me?

37
00:01:28,105 --> 00:01:28,940
I do.

38
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:33,959
<i>Ruse.</i>

39
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:35,179
<i>Charade.</i>

40
00:01:35,625 --> 00:01:36,624
<i>Deception.</i>

41
00:01:36,946 --> 00:01:40,182
<i>No matter how you define the words,
they begin and end with a lie.</i>

42
00:01:44,855 --> 00:01:45,980
Here you go, mate.

43
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:49,912
My mum always said
tea was medicine for the soul.

44
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:52,832
How are you feeling?

45
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,236
How should I feel?

46
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:58,165
It's going to take some going through.

47
00:01:58,724 --> 00:02:00,900
You've been through a lot tonight.

48
00:02:04,764 --> 00:02:07,067
What are you going to
tell everyone else at Latnok?

49
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:09,742
This group here don't need
to know anything other than

50
00:02:09,842 --> 00:02:13,213
what you're gonna tell your family
about Jessi running away.

51
00:02:13,923 --> 00:02:15,511
But the senior
members, they know.

52
00:02:15,611 --> 00:02:18,177
- You told them already?
- It's my job, mate.

53
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:20,639
Got to keep them up to speed.

54
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:23,559
But they're not even
care that Jessi's dead?

55
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,771
You have to understand.
You're their guy.

56
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:28,898
You always have been.

57
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:31,956
Come on.

58
00:02:33,214 --> 00:02:34,973
I want to show you something.

59
00:02:44,252 --> 00:02:45,956
- Was this mine?
- The one and only.

60
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,614
Took a little maneuvering

61
00:02:47,714 --> 00:02:50,557
to rebuild it after
the explosion at Zzyzx, but,

62
00:02:51,314 --> 00:02:53,631
but that's why our young
geniuses come in so handy.

63
00:02:54,493 --> 00:02:55,989
They rebuilt this?

64
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:57,990
Not exactly.

65
00:02:58,717 --> 00:03:00,411
They built it in pieces.

66
00:03:00,888 --> 00:03:02,223
Mark's algorithms.

67
00:03:02,472 --> 00:03:04,031
Nate's hoverboard magnets.

68
00:03:04,131 --> 00:03:06,138
Everyone contributed something.

69
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:07,770
You tricked them.

70
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:10,689
Their inventions had
practical applications.

71
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,192
- That's all they needed to know.
- What did I give you?

72
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,152
I'm sure you can figure it out.

73
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:21,106
The growth accelerant
that Nate and I developed.

74
00:03:21,206 --> 00:03:23,463
- Helps with muscle growth.
- Why didn't you just tell me

75
00:03:23,563 --> 00:03:25,829
that this is what
you were doing when you brought me in?

76
00:03:25,929 --> 00:03:28,302
How would you have
felt about that?

77
00:03:30,014 --> 00:03:31,659
If Zzyzx had their way,

78
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,562
I would have spent my entire life

79
00:03:33,662 --> 00:03:35,849
in this pod as some
type of bio-computer.

80
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:39,093
That's not the kind of technology
you want falling into the wrong hands.

81
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:40,670
There's your answer.

82
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,599
They knew you wouldn't approve.

83
00:03:42,699 --> 00:03:43,813
They were right.

84
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:44,746
But...

85
00:03:44,846 --> 00:03:47,454
you don't really have a choice
in the matter, do you?

86
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:49,359
Unless you want everyone you know

87
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,547
to know the truth about
what you did to Jessi.

88
00:03:51,647 --> 00:03:53,095
Is that what this is?

89
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:54,859
More blackmail?

90
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:57,720
I like to think of it
as self-preservation.

91
00:04:00,394 --> 00:04:02,480
We gonna have
a problem with that?

92
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:07,538
Look, in a couple of days,

93
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:10,517
Latnok are gonna have a
warehouse full

94
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:13,569
of specimens in gestation
to keep them occupied.

95
00:04:15,636 --> 00:04:17,366
They already have
everything they need?

96
00:04:17,656 --> 00:04:19,758
I have everything they need.

97
00:04:23,034 --> 00:04:24,776
I give it to them...

98
00:04:25,618 --> 00:04:26,849
they leave you alone.

99
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,603
Consider this your freedom.

100
00:04:31,596 --> 00:04:32,816
My gift to you.

00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,026
Thank God.

111
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,369
You're okay?

112
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,364
It worked. I got him
to tell me everything.

113
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:26,307
- What did he say?
- I'll explain it all, I promise.

114
00:05:26,407 --> 00:05:28,994
But I need to see Jessi.
I need to know that she's okay.

115
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:31,920
I'm okay.

116
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:13,849
Your

117
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,708
arms are growing.

118
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:18,445
They are?

119
00:06:21,293 --> 00:06:24,376
They're at least a half-centimeter
bigger in circumference.

120
00:06:24,476 --> 00:06:26,468
Have you increased
your exercise regimen?

121
00:06:27,515 --> 00:06:29,096
Maybe a little.

122
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,876
Your...

123
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:37,054
Your pectoral
muscles are also expanding.

124
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,916
What?

125
00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:45,268
Your hand...

126
00:06:46,173 --> 00:06:47,223
feels nice.

127
00:06:59,092 --> 00:06:59,900
Does

128
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:01,665
this one, too?

129
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,789
Did you just shock me?

130
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:21,357
No. Why would I shock you?

131
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,145
I don't know. I...

132
00:07:23,245 --> 00:07:25,508
I felt a charge
go through my body.

133
00:07:25,608 --> 00:07:27,279
- That's your libido.
- What?

134
00:07:29,384 --> 00:07:30,445
No it isn't.

135
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:33,077
I would have felt that before.

136
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,370
You never felt a charge with Amanda?

137
00:07:35,657 --> 00:07:37,374
I felt other things.

138
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,482
Well, maybe there was a power
surge in the area.

139
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:42,992
Maybe.

140
00:07:45,142 --> 00:07:47,517
So, how did you sleep
last night?

141
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:50,427
I didn't.

142
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:52,179
Neither did I.

143
00:07:57,287 --> 00:07:59,228
I'm sorry you had to
go through that.

144
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,397
I'm sure it wasn't easy...

145
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,300
confronting Cassidy
about Sarah.

146
00:08:05,232 --> 00:08:06,453
I was acting.

147
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:15,682
I'm fine.

148
00:08:16,725 --> 00:08:17,663
I promise.

149
00:08:26,696 --> 00:08:28,630
There's that power surge again.

150
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,190
Josh is still asleep, but I talked
to Lori about what's going on.

151
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:48,696
I'll finish getting dressed
and be right out.

152
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,748
I'll be in the other room,
pretending to be dead.

153
00:08:56,584 --> 00:08:57,995
I'm not happy about this.

154
00:08:58,847 --> 00:09:02,547
I'm sorry. Jessi came in,
and things got weird. But,

155
00:09:03,242 --> 00:09:05,460
- It won't happen again.
- Not that. Well,

156
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,827
yes, that. But more importantly,
I don't like this game

157
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,764
you guys are playing with Cassidy.
It's dangerous.

158
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:12,329
I don't like it either.

159
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:14,511
I've given you a lot of leeway
in the past,

160
00:09:14,785 --> 00:09:16,668
but this just feels different.

161
00:09:16,768 --> 00:09:19,748
There's something about it.
Something about Cassidy...

162
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,935
He scares me.

163
00:09:22,693 --> 00:09:24,563
I'm going to take care of it.

164
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:25,766
I promise.

165
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,512
I need it to be over.

166
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:30,294
We can't keep doing this
to our family.

167
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:54,054
Hide and seek with parents
downstairs is not cool.

168
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,986
Straight to voice mail?
Not cool.

169
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:12,244
Leaving without saying
goodbye? Even less cool.

170
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:13,487
What's wrong with you?

171
00:10:16,204 --> 00:10:17,398
Call me back.

172
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,911
Can anyone help me figure out how to
throttle my girlfriend long-distance?

173
00:10:22,011 --> 00:10:24,039
- Why long-distance?
- Because she left.

174
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:27,336
Vamoosed. Hitched a ride
on the a-train to Cleveland.

175
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:29,831
She didn't even have the
courage to tell me in person.

176
00:10:29,931 --> 00:10:31,364
She left this on my pillow.

177
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,798
On your pillow?

178
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:35,425
Ask Dad.

179
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,551
Oh, I will.

180
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,520
Mom?

181
00:10:38,503 --> 00:10:39,497
Are you okay?

182
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:40,844
You know what?

183
00:10:41,043 --> 00:10:41,849
Yeah.

184
00:10:42,249 --> 00:10:44,460
If she's just gonna up and
leave like that, forget her.

185
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,431
I'm fine.

186
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:47,652
Dandy.
Copa-freakin'-cetic.

187
00:10:47,752 --> 00:10:49,690
She was probably
afraid to say goodbye.

188
00:10:49,858 --> 00:10:51,942
Then she's a coward.
Good riddance.

189
00:10:53,134 --> 00:10:54,394
Josh, I'm sorry.

190
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:56,947
But there's something else
we need to talk about...

191
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:02,231
Here's what I have so far.

192
00:11:02,986 --> 00:11:04,226
Leave it open.

193
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:07,615
Well...

194
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:11,818
In order to fill,
say, 100 pods,

195
00:11:11,918 --> 00:11:15,024
Cassidy would need at least
5,000 gallons of formula on hand.

196
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:17,335
Not to mention the space
he'd need to house the pods.

197
00:11:17,435 --> 00:11:18,385
I ran a search,

198
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:21,930
and there are over 5300 warehouses
in Seattle that are big enough.

199
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:25,261
The formula would have to be
kept at a certain temperature

200
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,737
in order to sustain its
nutritional elements...

201
00:11:27,837 --> 00:11:30,314
probably a few degrees
below body temperature.

202
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,407
That's a way to narrow it down.

203
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:37,713
We can access the city
police's thermal imaging scans,

204
00:11:38,068 --> 00:11:40,513
like how they find the
people growing the weed.

205
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:42,161
- The weed?
- Yeah, the...

206
00:11:42,261 --> 00:11:43,238
The blaze.

207
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:44,615
The herb.

208
00:11:44,715 --> 00:11:45,653
The chronic.

209
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:47,581
- Where did you pick that up?
- Cable.

210
00:11:49,755 --> 00:11:51,965
Once we find where
they're hiding the formula,

211
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:54,046
we need to sabotage it
so that it doesn't work.

212
00:11:54,374 --> 00:11:56,168
And destroy any way of
re-creating it.

213
00:11:56,268 --> 00:11:58,175
What about the pods?
How do we destroy them?

214
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:01,196
We won't need to. Without the
formula, they're useless.

215
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,197
Where?

216
00:12:06,297 --> 00:12:07,547
I hear her heartbeat.

217
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:09,779
You're still listening
for her heartbeat?

218
00:12:10,025 --> 00:12:11,647
It comes naturally now.

219
00:12:13,246 --> 00:12:14,900
She's coming to the window.

220
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:18,504
You've gotta go. She can't see
you. You're supposed to be missing.

221
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:27,932
Hi.

222
00:12:28,032 --> 00:12:28,955
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:31,593
I know this is weird,
but I really need to talk to you

224
00:12:31,693 --> 00:12:33,721
and I don't want
anyone else to know about it.

225
00:12:33,821 --> 00:12:35,005
What happened?

226
00:12:36,237 --> 00:12:37,522
Here, come in.

227
00:12:44,434 --> 00:12:46,850
- I think you were right about Nate.
- What did he do?

228
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,101
I found all this odd
research in his dorm room.

229
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,644
You were in his dorm room?

230
00:12:52,546 --> 00:12:54,712
I saw the number from
the Ouija board.

231
00:12:54,812 --> 00:12:57,085
When you asked
what your birthday was?

232
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:58,652
7 8 1 2 2 7.

233
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:01,071
There were drawings
of these chambers...

234
00:13:01,954 --> 00:13:05,033
that could carry a baby without
a birth mother. Or an umbilical cord.

235
00:13:05,578 --> 00:13:08,036
Your father's name,
Adam Baylin, was everywhere.

236
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:11,794
I know you have secrets,
and I try not to pry, but Kyle,

237
00:13:12,095 --> 00:13:15,502
- it's like he was studying your life.
- Does he know you saw all of this?

238
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:18,434
You said there were people
who would use

239
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:20,266
those you care about to get to you.

240
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:21,831
Is he one of them?

241
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:23,802
I think he might be.

242
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:27,217
Why do I always do this?

243
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:30,475
Why do I always get involved
with the lying, cheating jerks?

244
00:13:34,028 --> 00:13:34,980
I'm sorry.

245
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:38,608
Amanda, I need you
to stay away from him.

246
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:41,333
I can't guarantee it's safe
to be around him.

247
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:45,949
What?

248
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:47,952
It's you.

249
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:52,046
The Charlies,
the Nates of this world...

250
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:53,957
those are the real jerks.

251
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,075
You,

252
00:13:55,175 --> 00:13:56,296
no matter what,

253
00:13:56,396 --> 00:13:58,420
are one of the good guys.

254
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,243
I always knew you were.

255
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:02,299
Even when I thought I didn't.

256
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:03,990
I try to be.

257
00:14:04,506 --> 00:14:05,605
You are.

258
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:38,728
<i>Kissing Amanda, I felt
a rolling flutter deep inside.</i>

259
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,067
<i>I'd heard the term before,</i>

260
00:14:41,305 --> 00:14:42,504
<i>'butterflies.'</i>

261
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:46,435
<i>How was it possible to feel
electricity for one person</i>

262
00:14:46,535 --> 00:14:48,432
<i>and butterflies for another?</i>

263
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:03,228
I think Cassidy has
Adam's data stored

264
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:05,562
on an isolated server
at the university.

265
00:15:05,662 --> 00:15:08,210
I saw the system last night.
If I can get back in there,

266
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:11,284
I can swap it out with a dummy drive
and figure out if he made any back-ups.

267
00:15:12,018 --> 00:15:13,539
I need to get rid of all of them.

268
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,356
Don't you think Cassidy
would be watching you closely?

269
00:15:16,456 --> 00:15:18,488
I'll need some sort of distraction.

270
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,236
You can't go.

271
00:15:22,953 --> 00:15:24,722
- You're dead.
- I know.

272
00:15:24,822 --> 00:15:26,672
And dead girls
get stuck in the house

273
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,898
doing thermal scans of
Seattle's industrial district.

274
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:31,304
I almost hate to suggest it,
but what about Mark?

275
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:34,641
We don't know
if we can fully trust him yet.

276
00:15:34,741 --> 00:15:35,555
I do.

277
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:38,075
I mean, based on my little
recon mission last night,

278
00:15:38,175 --> 00:15:40,169
we know he's no fan of Cassidy's.

279
00:15:40,269 --> 00:15:42,801
And I know it's not my life
we're talking about, but,

280
00:15:42,901 --> 00:15:45,443
your secret is my secret, too.
It's all of ours.

281
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,905
Do we have to spend the rest of our
lives not ever letting anyone else in?

282
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,275
This situation is too extreme, Lori.
No matter how much you care about him.

283
00:15:52,667 --> 00:15:53,879
The problem is,

284
00:15:53,979 --> 00:15:56,413
we don't have anyone else
who has an excuse to be in Latnok.

285
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:59,291
That's not entirely true.

286
00:16:09,183 --> 00:16:11,803
What is this, Bring
Your Mother to Work Day?

287
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:25,099
I'm sorry, Michael. I hate
to bother you like this, but,

288
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,597
can I speak to you?
It's about last night.

289
00:16:29,092 --> 00:16:31,835
I know I wasn't the best dinner guest,
but I didn't think my behavior

290
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:33,746
- warranted a house call.
- No, it's Jessi.

291
00:16:33,846 --> 00:16:35,088
She never came home.

292
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,733
I see. I'm sorry.

293
00:16:38,015 --> 00:16:38,860
Come in.

294
00:16:39,677 --> 00:16:40,522
Thanks.

295
00:16:43,405 --> 00:16:45,940
So, she wasn't at her apartment?

296
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,573
First place I checked.

297
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,576
I don't know why I thought
she might come here,

298
00:16:49,676 --> 00:16:52,217
especially after
your confrontation. But,

299
00:16:52,317 --> 00:16:54,202
I didn't know where else to look.

300
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:56,359
Yeah, I'm sorry.
This is my fault.

301
00:16:56,459 --> 00:16:57,675
Oh, please, no.

302
00:16:58,024 --> 00:17:00,977
It's not the first time
she's run away, unfortunately...

303
00:17:18,644 --> 00:17:21,358
- Where did she go the last time?
- The woods.

304
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,042
It's a long story, and yes,
we've already looked.

305
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:26,430
She's had a rough go of it.

306
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:29,091
You used to counsel her, didn't you?

307
00:17:34,356 --> 00:17:35,660
Is there a problem?

308
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,630
No, not at all. It's just...

309
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,579
It's a bit of a sore subject.

310
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,852
I received a warning for taking her in.
I almost lost my license.

311
00:17:50,309 --> 00:17:52,750
Well, she was very lucky
to have had you helping her.

312
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:53,982
Thank you.

313
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,157
It's nice to feel appreciated.

314
00:17:57,903 --> 00:17:59,884
You've done an
amazing job with Kyle.

315
00:17:59,984 --> 00:18:02,080
All I know,
you mean a lot to him.

316
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:04,619
He means a lot to us.

317
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:14,902
Are you cleaning?

318
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:17,952
In a manner of speaking, yes.
I am cleaning my life.

319
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:21,683
I have too many things that remind
me of Andy. I am purging...

320
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:26,477
And please don't touch anything.
It's all exactly where I want it.

321
00:18:33,314 --> 00:18:34,779
Staphylococcus aureus.

322
00:18:35,177 --> 00:18:36,990
No. That is in fact a cup.

323
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,325
Inside the cup. The bacteria.

324
00:18:39,696 --> 00:18:41,389
How long has this been here?

325
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,056
Could be this morning...
Could be last month...

326
00:18:44,156 --> 00:18:46,871
Your room is the perfect
environment for it to grow.

327
00:18:46,971 --> 00:18:48,789
It's warm, dark,

328
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:50,628
and a little...

329
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:52,213
- Manly?
- Dank.

330
00:18:53,018 --> 00:18:55,076
Why am I letting you stand in my
room and insult me?

331
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,953
- Because your dankness...
- Manliness.

332
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:59,832
Just gave me an idea of how
to disable the formula.

333
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:15,445
<i>I needed to burn Adam's journals
to erase his records of the experiment.</i>

334
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,715
<i>But I knew I was also burning
the only real connection I had</i>

335
00:19:32,815 --> 00:19:34,964
<i>to the man who had given me life.</i>

336
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,027
<i>And the way he had given it.</i>

337
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:43,526
Thank you for earlier.

338
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,391
I'm just glad it's over.

339
00:19:47,648 --> 00:19:50,339
According to the hard drive,
he made a single backup of data.

340
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,944
I think I saw the disc in his
safe when I found Sarah's ring.

341
00:19:53,044 --> 00:19:55,485
He'll have moved it by now.
Maybe to his apartment.

342
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:57,487
Now you're breaking
into his apartment?

343
00:19:58,319 --> 00:20:00,373
If I don't destroy every trace
of this formula,

344
00:20:00,473 --> 00:20:01,908
he'll just re-create it.

345
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,227
I have to make sure
that doesn't happen.

346
00:20:05,189 --> 00:20:08,122
I can't help wishing you'd just
taken him up on his offer of freedom.

347
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:12,717
They're re-starting the experiment.

348
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:14,838
They're playing God!

349
00:20:15,006 --> 00:20:17,841
And if Cassidy is any indication
of the kind of people they are,

350
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,802
- I don't want them to have that power.
- I understand.

351
00:20:21,255 --> 00:20:24,430
I do. But the deeper in you get,
the more it's changing you.

352
00:20:25,047 --> 00:20:28,224
- Changing me?
- You fake Jessi's death.

353
00:20:28,837 --> 00:20:29,795
You're lying,

354
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:32,311
you're sneaking around,
breaking laws...

355
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,854
This just isn't you.

356
00:20:36,127 --> 00:20:38,308
At least it's not
who you used to be.

357
00:20:54,163 --> 00:20:56,530
- Thanks for coming with me.
- Are you kidding?

358
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,050
Being your lookout,
breaking into someone's apartment...

359
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,003
It's like the old days.
I'd be pissed if you hadn't asked me.

360
00:21:02,103 --> 00:21:03,248
This is it.

361
00:21:03,739 --> 00:21:05,515
I have the keys
to Jessi's apartment.

362
00:21:05,615 --> 00:21:08,120
I'll go in there, climb through
the air-conditioning ducts,

363
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,852
and then drop down into Cassidy's.

364
00:21:09,952 --> 00:21:11,965
Or, I could just pick the lock.

365
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:15,679
Don't ask.

366
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,950
Isn't that breaking and entering?

367
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,819
It was okay when you
were just entering?

368
00:21:24,565 --> 00:21:26,242
Let's see what we find.

369
00:21:27,101 --> 00:21:29,404
Cassidy's passport
and birth certificate.

370
00:21:29,505 --> 00:21:32,874
- In case of a quick getaway, I guess.
- He's not using his real name.

371
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,209
It says Michael Cassidy Kingsley.

372
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,462
Mother, Grace.
Father, unknown.

373
00:21:39,606 --> 00:21:40,782
Grace Kingsley.

374
00:21:41,575 --> 00:21:43,586
Why does that name sound familiar?

375
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:49,102
<i>Grace Kingsley...</i>

376
00:21:53,762 --> 00:21:56,038
Grace Kingsley was
in Adam's notebooks.

377
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:58,729
She's a member of Latnok.

378
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:14,207
Easy, killer.
It's just a game.

379
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,783
It's not just a game.

380
00:22:15,883 --> 00:22:18,463
It's our game.
Mine and Andy's.

381
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:21,167
I thought making things explode
would make me feel better,

382
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,320
but it only reminded me
of how much this sucks.

383
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,010
It does suck.
Believe me, I know.

384
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,207
Lori didn't move thousands
of miles away

385
00:22:28,307 --> 00:22:31,683
while you were still both in love
and leave you without saying goodbye.

386
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:33,768
All she did was reject
your sorry ass.

387
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:36,604
I have an idea.

388
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,064
Death by porn?

389
00:22:38,636 --> 00:22:41,359
Just give me a few minutes.
I have to make a call.

390
00:22:44,595 --> 00:22:47,699
If his mother knew Adam,
then she must have known Sarah.

391
00:22:48,449 --> 00:22:50,841
I wonder if she knows
her son is a killer.

392
00:22:51,521 --> 00:22:53,663
This is everything on the disk.

393
00:22:58,214 --> 00:23:01,410
- That's the formula for the fluid.
- You found it.

394
00:23:12,294 --> 00:23:13,850
- It worked.
- What did?

395
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,243
The thermal imaging.
That facility is storing

396
00:23:16,343 --> 00:23:19,022
a large amount of something
at the temperature we were tracking.

397
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:22,108
Let's assume we're right,
and the existing formula is there.

398
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:24,242
I'll go,
add your bacteria to the fluid,

399
00:23:24,342 --> 00:23:26,379
then get out before
anyone knows I was there.

400
00:23:26,479 --> 00:23:28,200
I wish I could go with you.

401
00:23:30,139 --> 00:23:31,283
I do, too.

402
00:23:36,397 --> 00:23:39,572
We should see what else is on
the disk before we destroy it.

403
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:48,926
The pod schematics.

404
00:23:50,746 --> 00:23:53,139
Step one.
Genome insertion.

405
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,372
Step two.
Clone development.

406
00:23:57,238 --> 00:23:59,870
Clone? I thought they
used human embryos.

407
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,187
That's the way
it's always been done.

408
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:06,069
They must be using someone's
genetic sequence to create a clone.

409
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:13,046
- 7 8 1 2 2 7.
- That's impossible.

410
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:20,441
Latnok isn't planning
to gestate babies in those pods.

411
00:24:21,074 --> 00:24:22,418
They're making clones...

412
00:24:24,022 --> 00:24:24,921
of me.

413
00:24:33,108 --> 00:24:35,526
- You've got to be kidding me.
- Is that even possible?

414
00:24:35,626 --> 00:24:38,342
It never was before.
Now with the pods and the formula,

415
00:24:38,442 --> 00:24:40,937
the development process is a
more regulated environment.

416
00:24:41,105 --> 00:24:44,023
I can't even wrap my head around
the breach of scientific ethics.

417
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,005
It's even worse than just cloning.

418
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:48,706
Jessi and I were in gestation
for sixteen years.

419
00:24:48,806 --> 00:24:51,156
That's what allowed our brains
to develop the way they did.

420
00:24:51,256 --> 00:24:53,475
Without all that time,
we'd be just like everyone else.

421
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:56,218
So in order for them to create
more children like you...

422
00:24:56,318 --> 00:24:58,507
They would have to be
in the pods for years.

423
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:02,208
But why just you?
Why not both of you?

424
00:25:04,589 --> 00:25:06,434
They think I'm damaged.

425
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:10,112
I think we've already
established how wrong they are.

426
00:25:10,212 --> 00:25:12,246
Still, Kyle is special.

427
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:15,304
It's understandable why they
would want more like him.

428
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:18,861
If I'm special, it's not because
of how I came into this world.

429
00:25:18,961 --> 00:25:21,487
It's what happened
to me once I was in it.

430
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,025
You took me in.

431
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:25,380
You loved me like I was
one of your own children.

432
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,163
Having you in my life...
that's what makes me special.

433
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:31,772
But this, what they're planning, it's
robbing someone of their childhood...

434
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:35,575
their connection to a mother...
a family. I can't allow that.

435
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,393
Which is why we have to make
sure it doesn't happen.

436
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:43,619
- Is that mold?
- No. Mold is a fungus.

437
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:46,257
This is a bacterial agent
that will compound

438
00:25:46,357 --> 00:25:48,975
exponentially when
introduced into a live organism.

439
00:25:49,075 --> 00:25:51,495
It'll basically suffocate any
nutritional elements growing

440
00:25:51,595 --> 00:25:54,218
in the formula,
so it won't allow anything to grow.

441
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:55,661
Of course it will.

442
00:25:57,651 --> 00:25:59,125
I have to get going.

443
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:05,105
Just... Be careful.

444
00:26:05,547 --> 00:26:06,564
Please.

445
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,953
I'll be home soon.

446
00:26:25,819 --> 00:26:27,984
Are you sure
you don't need back-up?

447
00:26:28,242 --> 00:26:31,201
We can't risk anyone seeing
you until this is all over.

448
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:36,162
When it is over,
what happens with your life?

449
00:26:37,945 --> 00:26:39,196
What do you mean?

450
00:26:39,296 --> 00:26:43,017
We'll destroy the experiment.
And then we can focus on Cassidy.

451
00:26:44,151 --> 00:26:47,980
But one day soon, if we're successful,
your life will just return to normal.

452
00:26:49,656 --> 00:26:52,471
I'm starting to realize
my life can never be normal.

453
00:26:53,201 --> 00:26:56,284
But it would be nice to get back
to some type of constant.

454
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,377
Does constant mean Amanda?

455
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,223
I don't know what it means.

456
00:27:10,403 --> 00:27:12,042
Sorry, Jessi.

457
00:27:12,939 --> 00:27:14,547
I wish I did.

458
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:18,761
I wish I could understand how I could
have feelings for more than one person.

459
00:27:21,821 --> 00:27:24,141
You're saying you
have feelings for me?

460
00:27:24,955 --> 00:27:27,110
Why would you even have to ask that?

461
00:27:30,347 --> 00:27:32,275
- What are you looking for?
- Nicole.

462
00:27:32,883 --> 00:27:33,842
Why?

463
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:48,540
Good luck.

464
00:28:01,459 --> 00:28:03,389
- What happened?
- The lamp blew out.

465
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:05,119
I'll fix it.

466
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,158
- I rock.
- Why do you rock?

467
00:28:13,354 --> 00:28:15,484
And why aren't we making
me feel any better yet?

468
00:28:16,465 --> 00:28:17,723
Maybe this will.

469
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:27,130
Hi.

470
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:30,455
Jackie told me how to hijack
the car's navigational system

471
00:28:30,555 --> 00:28:32,793
and walk Andy through linking
up a video camera.

472
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:36,019
So even though she's on the road
in the middle of the country,

473
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:38,049
you get to see your girlfriend.

474
00:28:38,149 --> 00:28:40,736
Don't understand that at all, but...

475
00:28:41,417 --> 00:28:42,747
thanks, man.

476
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:43,798
Really.

477
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,015
You're welcome.

478
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:53,356
Where are you?

479
00:28:54,127 --> 00:28:56,436
Some rest stop in North Dakota.

480
00:28:56,941 --> 00:29:00,834
Declan totally hacked into our
minivan's GPS. You're lucky we have one.

481
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:03,484
Your moms are lesbians.
How could they not?

482
00:29:05,587 --> 00:29:07,848
Are they... listening
to me right now?

483
00:29:07,948 --> 00:29:10,998
Lucky for you, they took
my brothers in to pee.

484
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,834
Good, because you are in
big trouble, young missy.

485
00:29:14,208 --> 00:29:16,379
I know. I totally suck.

486
00:29:16,641 --> 00:29:18,063
You totally do.

487
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:20,299
How could you not say goodbye?

488
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,579
I chickened out.

489
00:29:25,537 --> 00:29:27,181
I couldn't say goodbye to you.

490
00:29:29,916 --> 00:29:31,257
I still can't.

491
00:29:33,339 --> 00:29:36,525
Well, then it doesn't
have to be goodbye.

492
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:40,736
It can be hello with
a lot of miles between us.

493
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,169
In that case,

494
00:29:44,375 --> 00:29:45,199
hello.

495
00:29:47,128 --> 00:29:47,932
Hi.

496
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:53,173
You know what?
We can say hello every day

497
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:55,119
until I get to see you again.

498
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,586
And then every day after that.

499
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,854
This should only
take about 20 minutes.

500
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,272
Just need to cable the system
and run a quick diagnostic.

501
00:30:59,372 --> 00:31:00,285
No problem.

502
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:19,793
I imagine you're not
dropping off another lasagna.

503
00:31:21,263 --> 00:31:23,797
- I'll come back later.
- Sorry. But you can't leave.

504
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:26,737
- Why?
- Because you've seen me.

505
00:31:26,837 --> 00:31:28,960
- Not following.
- I'm supposed to be missing

506
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:32,270
and if you tell your new boyfriend
that I'm not, you'll ruin everything.

507
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:35,342
He's not my boyfriend.
He's not anything anymore.

508
00:31:35,612 --> 00:31:37,316
I told Kyle I'd stay away from him,

509
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,725
but he still has all that stuff
about him in his dorm room.

510
00:31:39,825 --> 00:31:41,798
- Why didn't you just take it?
- I don't know.

511
00:31:41,898 --> 00:31:45,221
- Because that would be stealing.
- But Nate stole it in the first place.

512
00:31:45,615 --> 00:31:47,873
I guess it just didn't occur to me,
all right?

513
00:31:47,973 --> 00:31:50,282
- I'm not as smart as you.
- That's true.

514
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,831
I just came to say that Nate's
working until ten tonight,

515
00:31:53,931 --> 00:31:55,951
so if Kyle wants to get
into the room, he can.

516
00:31:56,051 --> 00:31:58,082
- Kyle's not home.
- Then you do it.

517
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:01,126
- I can't go anywhere.
- You still haven't explained that.

518
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,753
And I don't plan on it.

519
00:32:04,647 --> 00:32:07,042
Look, unfortunately,
you're gonna have to do it.

520
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:10,208
Do what? Break into his
room and steal his files?

521
00:32:10,308 --> 00:32:12,096
I was thinking firebomb, but okay.

522
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,463
Almost done.
It's just...

523
00:32:49,088 --> 00:32:50,801
You don't have to watch.

524
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:54,847
Unless you just like... lurking.

525
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:04,380
Ninety-six percent.

526
00:33:06,081 --> 00:33:07,318
Ninety-seven.

527
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:21,081
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah, I can hear you.

528
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,937
I'm going to ghost his system.

529
00:33:23,037 --> 00:33:25,545
So, basically it'll be like
I'm sitting right where you are.

530
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:27,514
Less chance for operator error.

531
00:33:30,077 --> 00:33:32,613
Okay. Open up the systems file.

532
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:34,582
I need you to get his IP address.

533
00:33:34,682 --> 00:33:37,020
- If you know...
- I know what that is.

534
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,307
Save the sarcasm.

535
00:33:39,258 --> 00:33:41,787
Type it into the "share host"
box down at the bottom.

536
00:33:41,887 --> 00:33:44,104
And change all the
settings to "allow."

537
00:33:51,416 --> 00:33:52,390
Perfect.

538
00:33:56,365 --> 00:33:58,574
There's a lot of stuff
here Nate's been collecting.

539
00:33:58,674 --> 00:33:59,695
<i>About Kyle?</i>

540
00:34:00,268 --> 00:34:01,752
See for yourself.

541
00:34:03,184 --> 00:34:05,547
I've wanted to know
his secrets for so long...

542
00:34:06,163 --> 00:34:07,544
Here it all is.

543
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,463
Yeah, well take a good look.

544
00:34:10,967 --> 00:34:14,550
No. When he's ready to tell me,
then it'll mean something.

545
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:16,450
For now, this is just weird.

546
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,389
Always the good girl.

547
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:20,725
Not all of us can be
as wild as you, Jessi.

548
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,251
Apparently, you can.

549
00:34:24,828 --> 00:34:25,807
Amanda?

550
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:27,940
What's wrong?

551
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,149
Nate...

552
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:37,524
<i>This is Cassidy.</i>

553
00:34:37,624 --> 00:34:40,148
I caught Kyle's girlfriends
going through my stuff.

554
00:34:40,248 --> 00:34:42,371
- Girlfriends?
- Amanda and Jessi.

555
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:45,791
Jessi. That's impossible.
She's... missing.

556
00:34:46,072 --> 00:34:47,960
Well, if she was,
she isn't anymore.

557
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:51,794
Find out what they know.

558
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,761
Shut it down.
Mr. Cassidy wants everyone out of here.

559
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,865
- I haven't finished yet.
- We have orders.

560
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,473
We need to check the perimeter.

561
00:35:26,891 --> 00:35:28,242
What are you doing?

562
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:31,881
What is this?

563
00:35:32,479 --> 00:35:33,422
A bacteria.

564
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:36,421
- A bacteria? Why would you...
- Mark. We don't have much time.

565
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:39,318
Do you have any idea what
you've been helping Cassidy do?

566
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,122
Computerized in-vitro
gestational chambers.

567
00:35:43,222 --> 00:35:45,006
For women who
can't give birth naturally.

568
00:35:45,106 --> 00:35:46,516
I wish that's what it was.

569
00:35:46,616 --> 00:35:49,575
- What are you talking about?
- Cassidy has been using you.

570
00:35:49,791 --> 00:35:53,204
Latnok is not what they say they are.
And that I need your help.

571
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,765
I need you to trust me.

572
00:35:57,353 --> 00:35:58,238
Please.

573
00:36:06,813 --> 00:36:08,164
I'll distract them.

574
00:36:08,607 --> 00:36:10,690
Just do what you
need to do and get out.

575
00:36:31,078 --> 00:36:32,140
Hello?

576
00:36:53,003 --> 00:36:55,921
You're very anxious, for someone
who's looking for a dead girl.

577
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:04,275
- I told you, I didn't see anything.
- I wish I could believe that.

578
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:05,781
I really do.

579
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,533
- Why did you do that?
- I thought you could use the help.

580
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:26,423
We have to get the files
and get moving.

581
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:28,460
- He's not gonna be out for very long.
- Why not?

582
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,455
Because you don't hit hard enough.

583
00:37:35,635 --> 00:37:36,645
Better?

584
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:44,928
Where are they?
What did you do?

585
00:37:45,354 --> 00:37:46,324
Relax.

586
00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:49,344
They're on their way to the Rack.

587
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:52,227
To meet you, actually.

588
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:56,440
I may not be a genius, but I
know how to clone a cell phone.

589
00:37:56,742 --> 00:38:00,986
Speaking of, you've put me in
quite a bind with your little tricks.

590
00:38:01,527 --> 00:38:03,196
Latnok's gonna
think I failed them.

591
00:38:03,475 --> 00:38:05,960
Failed them?
Or failed her?

592
00:38:06,393 --> 00:38:08,994
- What?
- You know what I'm talking about.

593
00:38:10,858 --> 00:38:13,570
So you found out about my mum.

594
00:38:14,941 --> 00:38:15,883
You know,

595
00:38:16,543 --> 00:38:18,141
if she had her way,

596
00:38:18,241 --> 00:38:20,563
you wouldn't still be
living this life of yours.

597
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:24,009
Latnok would have complete
control over you, and believe me,

598
00:38:24,273 --> 00:38:28,603
it's only a matter of time before she
figures out how to get what she wants.

599
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,140
I was going to convince her
to let you go.

600
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,542
All because I thought
you saved my life.

601
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:37,609
Who knew what a clever
little liar you would be?

602
00:38:37,709 --> 00:38:38,774
I had no choice.

603
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,985
We all have choices.
Like how I

604
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,425
am choosing to forgive you
for what you've done

605
00:38:44,525 --> 00:38:46,156
and give you a chance to fix it.

606
00:38:46,693 --> 00:38:48,710
Then no one need be any the wiser.

607
00:38:49,009 --> 00:38:51,495
Even if I knew how to do that,
I wouldn't.

608
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,163
Oh, you know.

609
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:56,959
It's all up there
in that head of yours.

610
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:00,776
Forgot about that, didn't you?

611
00:39:02,045 --> 00:39:04,261
I can think of a few people
who probably haven't.

612
00:39:04,361 --> 00:39:07,075
But they went about it
the wrong way in the past.

613
00:39:07,797 --> 00:39:12,141
Anyone with a brain knows there's
only one way to get you to cooperate.

614
00:39:16,628 --> 00:39:19,505
You figured out what
I did to get rid of Sarah.

615
00:39:21,103 --> 00:39:23,777
So you know what I'm willing
to do to get what I want.

616
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:36,518
We're okay. Nate's still out cold.

617
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:53,765
That ring... looks a lot like
the one Kyle wears around his neck.

618
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,475
Nate stole it from Cassidy.

619
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,478
It belonged to my mother.

620
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:08,447
So I guess you kind
of helped me find it.

621
00:40:08,957 --> 00:40:10,923
And you saved me, so...

622
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:13,005
I guess we're even?

623
00:40:14,943 --> 00:40:18,756
Look, I know we've never
really gotten along, but...

624
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:20,931
I don't know.

625
00:40:21,529 --> 00:40:24,540
I feel like we might be a
little bit closer than before.

626
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,193
So I think it's only
fair that I tell you...

627
00:40:36,286 --> 00:40:37,626
Tell me what?

628
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:40,439
I'm going to tell
Kyle I want him back.

629
00:40:46,239 --> 00:40:48,229
You really have
the nerve to say that?

630
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,995
After everything
that happened tonight?

631
00:40:51,095 --> 00:40:53,325
Like I said, fair warning.

632
00:40:56,972 --> 00:40:58,126
You deserve it.

633
00:41:00,972 --> 00:41:03,038
You're a lot braver than I thought.

634
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:11,980
Origin...?

635
00:41:13,382 --> 00:41:14,423
What is it?

636
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,017
I don't believe it.

637
00:41:24,395 --> 00:41:26,406
You still wear Adam's Latnok ring.

638
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:30,028
How awfully sentimental.
And lucky for me.

639
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:36,369
- Why are you doing this?
- Because that is what they want.

640
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:39,746
That's what she wants.

641
00:41:40,727 --> 00:41:42,707
And if you try to stop me,

642
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,043
I'm just gonna have to keep
hurting you.

643
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Then,

644
00:41:48,905 --> 00:41:50,864
I'm gonna hurt Jessi...

645
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,845
until she wishes
she had really died.

646
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,659
And then,

647
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:01,195
just when you think
it couldn't get any worse,

648
00:42:04,617 --> 00:42:07,858
I'll hurt everybody that
ever mattered to you.

649
00:42:10,111 --> 00:42:11,946
Starting with Amanda.

650
00:42:15,803 --> 00:42:17,813
How you feelin' about that, mate?

651
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:21,049
<i>Nicole had been right when she said</i>

652
00:42:21,149 --> 00:42:23,677
<i>she didn't recognize
the person I had become.</i>

653
00:42:27,183 --> 00:42:29,084
<i>The person I had been before</i>

654
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:31,333
<i>would have never done this...</i>

655
00:43:01,843 --> 00:43:04,164
- You won't do it.
- What makes you so sure?

656
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:07,584
Because Grace Kingsley, my mother...

657
00:43:08,375 --> 00:43:09,828
What about her?

658
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,421
She's your mother, too.

659
00:43:17,535 --> 00:43:19,019
I'm your brother.

660
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:28,363
Merci d'avoir suivi Kyle XY avec nous.
Espérons tous une suite !!!
