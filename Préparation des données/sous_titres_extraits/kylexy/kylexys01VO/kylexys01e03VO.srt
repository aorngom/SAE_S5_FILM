1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,312
Previously on Kyle XY

2
00:00:01,572 --> 00:00:06,066
Kyle, you've been with us for over a week, and you're telling us you haven't slept? Not even once?

3
00:00:06,122 --> 00:00:08,845
I'll tell you why Kyle hasn't slept for ten days. He's an alien.

4
00:00:08,916 --> 00:00:11,302
You said the last thing you remember was being in the woods. 

5
00:00:12,182 --> 00:00:14,528
-Now ah, how did you get there?
-I don't know.


6
00:00:14,691 --> 00:00:18,977
No one noticed he's gone? How could that be? He has to have come from somewhere.

7
00:00:19,136 --> 00:00:20,658
Someone has to be missing him.

8
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:25,688
-Trager, haven't seen you around, no time for me anymore?
-Might be able to fit you into my schedule.


9
00:00:26,688 --> 00:00:30,560
I want you to draw anything you can remember about where you came from.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,771
This must be the place near Victor Falls where he was first seen.

11
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:35,836
I think something significant may have happened there.

12
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,987
I bet your family's searching for you right now.

13
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:40,754
I mean, they have to be, you didn't just fall from the sky.

14
00:00:41,518 --> 00:00:43,125
Kyle! Kyle!

15
00:00:46,604 --> 00:00:48,878
-What are you doing here? 
-Why'd you come?


16
00:00:50,306 --> 00:00:52,706
I came so my family could find me.

17
00:01:06,054 --> 00:01:10,206
Mom! Dad! Help! Kyle! Come on already!

18
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,042
Kyle! Get out!

19
00:01:14,889 --> 00:01:15,509
What's going on?

20
00:01:15,542 --> 00:01:19,197
-I have to take a shower.
-And brainiac is still asleep in the tub.


21
00:01:20,726 --> 00:01:22,014
Kyle, time to get up.

22
00:01:22,302 --> 00:01:26,328
-It's so gross that he sleeps in there.
-Must remind him of his pod.


23
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,908
What are you gonna do, lure him out with your credit card?

24
00:01:31,403 --> 00:01:34,169
No, sweetie. That's how I would lure you out. Kyle's a lot easier.

25
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:39,787
-Whoa! Teach me!
-Not a chance.


26
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:41,725
-Me first.
-Hey, no! I'm bursting here.


27
00:01:41,725 --> 00:01:46,461
Alright, use my bathroom. You take a shower, use soap and shampoo, and don't just get your hair wet. 

28
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:47,195
Fine.

29
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:53,562
Kyle! Come on, I have to go to work.

30
00:01:53,562 --> 00:01:57,350
First he couldn't sleep, now he's Rip van Winkle? Kyle! Kyle!

31
00:01:57,350 --> 00:02:00,079
Dad, this isn't right, I have to take a shower before I go to work.

32
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,151
Yea, ok. But Kyle first. 

33
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:06,532
Next!

34
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:16,917
Everyone had something to do, and someplace to be. 

35
00:02:16,958 --> 00:02:20,606
-Hon, would you mind dropping off Josh?
-No, but we gotta get going. 


36
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:23,802
-Not until I find my notebook. 
-Here, dork. 


37
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:27,859
O, yea. Must have left it there last night when I went for that pudding. 

38
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:32,738
Ok, Kyle. You got plenty of papers, markers, Sour-Patch Kids.

39
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:38,010
I cannot believe you're taking Kyle to your office with you.

40
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:41,021
Your mom's got a lot of cases to catch up on, no big deal.

41
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:42,977
Besides, it's "Take your Alien to Work" Day.

42
00:02:43,502 --> 00:02:47,968
-Thank you, hon. Call if you need anything. 
-Alright, we'll be fine. Ready, men?


43
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:50,399
-Ready!
-O, joy. Summer school. 


44
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:54,349
See you later. 

45
00:02:54,503 --> 00:02:59,285
-Oh Lori, you're on my way. I can drop you at work. 
-That's ok. I'm meeting Hillary. 


46
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,965
-Hello?
-Mrs. Trager, Detective Breen.


47
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:09,114
-Oh, good morning. 
-I need to come see you today.


48
00:03:09,279 --> 00:03:10,800
Did you find something out about Kyle?

49
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,736
It looks like it. I think Kyle may be connected to a murder. 

50
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,269
I'll give you the details when I see you. 

51
00:03:48,768 --> 00:03:52,594
The elevator was a little room that gave me a strange sensation of rising. 

52
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:57,710
Everyone was careful not to look at each other, or touch. 

53
00:04:00,273 --> 00:04:05,469
Hello! Yea, we're in the elevator. You just tell Brad we got stuck in traffic. Yea. 

54
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:07,800
We didn't get stuck. 

55
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,315
-Just a little white lie.
-You lied? 


56
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:18,631
Uh, yes. But you shouldn't. Always tell the truth, Kyle. Ok? 

57
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:28,985
Here we are, first day on the job.

58
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:31,074
-I have a job?
-No I'm just kidding. 


59
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:32,596
But I want to help. 

60
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:35,314
Ah, you'll find something to do. Right now, I'm late for a meeting with Brad. 

61
00:04:35,314 --> 00:04:39,910
L. W. K. Software, please hold, yes, Sir they're sending somebody. 

62
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:43,450
Yes I-I did call. I just Sir? 

63
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:46,496
-Rough morning? 
-Yea, our server's down. 


64
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:49,293
-Again?
-Yea it crashed this morning. 


65
00:04:49,941 --> 00:04:51,204
Oh, can I help you?

66
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:52,726
I'm Stephen Trager, the B. P. 

67
00:04:52,756 --> 00:04:56,243
O, hi. I'm sorry, I'm Alice, and I'm a temp.

68
00:04:56,384 --> 00:04:57,159
A temp?

69
00:04:57,512 --> 00:04:59,693
Yea it means she's not here all the time. She's not permanent. 

70
00:04:59,693 --> 00:05:02,837
-Listen, I have to go and talk to Brad. 
-Uh, Brad?


71
00:05:02,895 --> 00:05:04,814
-The CEO. 
-Oh! 


72
00:05:04,814 --> 00:05:08,033
I need you to watch Kyle here. He's not used to being around so many people. 

73
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:10,666
And don't worry, he's just going to sit here and draw. 

74
00:05:11,213 --> 00:05:14,737
Uh Kyle, I need you to stay here with Alice, and I'll be right back as soon as I can. 

75
00:05:19,183 --> 00:05:24,942
-Why don't you wait for your dad, just over there?
-Stephen's not my dad. I'm a temp, too. 


76
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,020
The victim was shot. Some hikers found him near Victor Falls. 

77
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:39,460
Detective, I know Kyle was first seen there but that was a few weeks ago. 
This person was killed, way before. 


78
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:43,376
Not necessarily. The bones are bleached clean. 

79
00:05:43,542 --> 00:05:46,820
-We know that quick lime was poured on the body. 
-Quick lime?


80
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:50,602
It's used to decompose a corpse quickly, makes it hard to identify... 

81
00:05:51,092 --> 00:05:53,499
Probably the same reason why the teeth was smashed in. 

82
00:05:53,891 --> 00:05:56,802
-Kyle could never do anything like this. 
-I'm not saying he did.


83
00:05:56,821 --> 00:06:00,807
-Then he's not s suspect. 
-Well, we can't completely discount the possibility.


84
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:05,344
But I will tell you that some flesh remained beneath the victim's fingers that's indicating a struggle. 

85
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:08,798
Now, according to our records, Kyle didn't have a scratch on him when he was found. 

86
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,048
For Kyle to be involved in any way. 

87
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:14,305
You yourself say that trauma may have caused his amnesia. 

88
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:18,790
Well, yes. It's possible he witnessed the attack, or stumbled upon the skeleton. 

89
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,734
-Has he started to remember anything?
-No, I'm still working with him. 


90
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:29,791
-Alright. Well, once he sees these photographs. 
-No. Detective, we can't do that.


91
00:06:29,834 --> 00:06:33,447
Exposing Kyle to something like this could further traumatize him. 

92
00:06:33,447 --> 00:06:40,024
This is a murder investigation. If Kyle is a witness, or in some way involved, I need to find out.

93
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:45,148
If you could find a less disturbing trigger to help him remember. 

94
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:54,407
This symbol was on some sort of security key card we found near the remains in the woods. 

95
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:57,498
Now, either the victim or the killer may have dropped it. 

96
00:06:57,565 --> 00:07:00,699
We've run it through our database but haven't been able to trace it. 

97
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:05,480
If Kyle were to identify it, he might give us a lead. 

98
00:07:22,816 --> 00:07:26,702
-This so beats making out at night.
-Except it'll cost you your job.


99
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:29,570
I'm only missing one shift, it's no big deal. 

100
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,562
-Your parents must be proud. 
-They still think I'm going to work?


101
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,384
Trager, you're a bad girl. 

102
00:07:41,168 --> 00:07:43,368
Declan, it's not happening. 

103
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:49,310
There's always tomorrow.

104
00:07:53,013 --> 00:07:56,797
Uh, I can't tomorrow. I gotta golf with my dad.

105
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,388
-Your dad?!
-Yea, we're doing guy stuff all day. 


106
00:08:00,744 --> 00:08:04,450
-Since when do you like hanging out with your dad. 
-Who said I liked it? 


107
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:08,280
I like this though. 

108
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,398
L. W. K. Software. 

109
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:22,638
No-no-no, I've called three times already. We need to get somebody up here, we need our server fixed, now. 

110
00:08:24,122 --> 00:08:25,860
L. W. K. Software, please hold. 

111
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:38,666
Everyone had a place to be and something to do, just like at home. 

112
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:47,632
-Excuse me.
-I felt in the way here, too. 


113
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:53,047
You must be Kyle! Hey, I'm Mark, a friend of Stephen's. He's told me all about you. 

114
00:08:53,136 --> 00:08:55,112
-He has? 
-Absolutely! 


115
00:08:55,217 --> 00:08:57,728
So uh, what do you make of this joint? 

116
00:08:59,596 --> 00:09:00,749
The office. 

117
00:09:01,348 --> 00:09:02,829
Everyone has a job.

118
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:08,830
This is true! Anyways uh, Stephen's the best, the way he works, one big family. 

119
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,891
I gotta take this, Kyle. Hang on. 

120
00:09:29,996 --> 00:09:31,971
It was as if it were calling out to me. 

121
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:37,627
The server was something I understood, a chance for me to be useful. 

122
00:10:03,433 --> 00:10:08,123
I told you when we first started, it's not just me you're getting

123
00:10:08,147 --> 00:10:10,094
Well, that package got too expensive.

124
00:10:10,326 --> 00:10:12,516
Ok? We had a terrible quarter, terrible year. 

125
00:10:12,516 --> 00:10:16,382
-Now, if we ounce every source of research, dump the division.
-Dump the division?! 


126
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:21,224
These are people, Brad, with lives and families. Mark Ranchel's wife just had a baby! 

127
00:10:21,224 --> 00:10:23,214
You're not working out of your garage anymore. 

128
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:26,244
-You have an obligation now to your shareholders.
-And my friends!


129
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:29,879
They're employees, first, but you knew this day was coming. 

130
00:10:30,109 --> 00:10:31,767
We have cuts to make, you know that we do. 

131
00:10:35,382 --> 00:10:40,059
-Alright, I'll tell them.
-No you can't. 


132
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:45,188
-You have to just wait till next month OK? After this quarter.
-They have to make plans. 


133
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:49,096
If our shareholders hear that we're laying people off, they'll smell trouble. Our stocks could tank. 

134
00:10:49,981 --> 00:10:54,324
You have a loyalty to this company, you can't say a word. 

135
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:10,706
Oh! Uh... excuse me. Stephen, um I uh, kind of lost track of Kyle. 

136
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:14,847
-What? I told you to watch him.
-Well, I'm just supposed to answer the phones, so I don't¡­ 


137
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:15,633
Oh, no. 

138
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,307
Kyle, what did you do?

139
00:11:31,363 --> 00:11:33,714
-We need I. T. up here now. 
-Yea, I've been calling. 


140
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:36,996
There's some kind of design flaw, they need to call a specialist in.  

141
00:11:50,725 --> 00:11:52,046
What the hell is going on around here?

142
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:56,685
-Whoa Brad, where're you going?
-My damn e-mail's still not working. 


143
00:11:58,543 --> 00:11:59,612
Whoa, wait. 

144
00:12:05,449 --> 00:12:06,854
Well, it's about time. 

145
00:12:10,573 --> 00:12:12,559
We just left him a few minutes ago. 

146
00:12:15,486 --> 00:12:16,232
Good job. 

147
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:32,499
-Kyle, you don't have to draw there, you can use my desk.
-I don't mind. 


148
00:12:33,534 --> 00:12:38,051
You know now that you're sleeping better, let's put the second bed back into Josh's room. 

149
00:12:37,942 --> 00:12:40,028
But that's Josh's place in the house. 

150
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,575
I'll just sleep here. I'll wake up earlier so Lori can take a shower. 

151
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:47,333
-But it can't be comfortable. 
-It is for me. 


152
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:53,076
But it's so cold and hard, and Lori's hair products all over the place. 

153
00:12:53,513 --> 00:12:54,800
They smell good. 

154
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:59,177
-I really think it's time you transitioned back into a bed. 
-But I like the tub. 


155
00:13:00,421 --> 00:13:06,056
-There's something about it, it feels¡­
-Safe?


156
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:11,360
Yes, but it's more than that. 

157
00:13:12,836 --> 00:13:13,894
I don't know. 

158
00:13:16,017 --> 00:13:19,733
Alright, we won't push it. 

159
00:13:22,366 --> 00:13:24,874
Sleep in the tub, for now. 

160
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:29,867
May I see? 

161
00:13:32,522 --> 00:13:34,121
More of the woods.

162
00:13:36,575 --> 00:13:37,985
It's all that comes out. 

163
00:13:39,369 --> 00:13:42,868
Because these images are very vivid for you. 

164
00:13:43,907 --> 00:13:46,150
And we'll find out why in time. 

165
00:13:47,276 --> 00:13:50,068
Meanwhile, there's something I need to show you, come on. 

166
00:13:54,659 --> 00:13:59,686
Think carefully, Kyle, does this mean anything to you?

167
00:14:03,278 --> 00:14:03,934
No? 

168
00:14:04,472 --> 00:14:08,445
Take your time, do you recognize it at all?

169
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:12,757
-Should I?
-I don't know? 


170
00:14:14,383 --> 00:14:16,570
Do you think you've ever seen it before?

171
00:14:27,110 --> 00:14:27,741
No. 

172
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:41,229
Dad, I was on fire at summer school today, aced every problem.

173
00:14:41,229 --> 00:14:45,572
-So, algebra's making more sense to you now.
-Yea, but I need to chill out for a while.


174
00:14:46,038 --> 00:14:48,814
-Let me guess, with video games.  
-Great idea!


175
00:14:48,964 --> 00:14:51,423
Josh, we told you not till your grades improve. 

176
00:14:51,918 --> 00:14:54,318
Dad, I'm going through some serious withdrawal here. 

177
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:59,049
Listen, if you don't pass summer school you're not going to go to high school next year with your friends, is that what you want? 

178
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:02,446
-No.
-Then get upstairs and finish that test you brought home. 


179
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:09,350
-Wow, I thought I could be tough.
-Kid's smart, you just need to focus. 


180
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:12,654
-You're through working with Kyle?
-Yea. Listen. 


181
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:15,451
I have to tell you something, just try not to get alarmed. 

182
00:15:15,477 --> 00:15:18,392
I saw Detective Breen this morning, the police found¡­

183
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:23,251
-What?
-Nothing, we're just talking.


184
00:15:25,009 --> 00:15:25,922
About Kyle. 

185
00:15:29,017 --> 00:15:31,768
-Fine, be that way. 
-Oh, hang on Lori. 


186
00:15:31,906 --> 00:15:37,352
Listen, I can't bring Kyle to the office anymore, mom has to work. 
We really need you to watch him tomorrow. 


187
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:43,104
-Uh, like I have to work too, remember?
-He can sit at a table near the counter.


188
00:15:43,104 --> 00:15:48,955
-Some weird mutant scaring off customers? 
-Lori, it's just for a couple of hours, I really need your help. 


189
00:15:49,766 --> 00:15:53,881
-You brought him here, it's not my job to watch him.
-Come on, he's part of the family. 


190
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:56,524
I know you'd like to think that, but he's not. 

191
00:16:00,715 --> 00:16:01,643
Sorry

192
00:16:21,723 --> 00:16:24,344
-What are you doing?
-Homework.


193
00:16:25,054 --> 00:16:30,283
-Homework? Is that your job?
-It's my hell. 


194
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:36,421
X equals forty-nine.

195
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:39,678
Hey that's right. 

196
00:16:41,541 --> 00:16:43,235
You like math, don't you Kyle. 

197
00:16:50,076 --> 00:16:52,731
-He's linked to a murder?
-Shh the kids will hear. 


198
00:16:52,731 --> 00:16:56,605
-What else did Detective Breen say?
-Well, he's not sure Kyle is connected. 


199
00:16:56,679 --> 00:17:00,505
-And Kyle didn't recognize this?
-No, not yet anyway.


200
00:17:01,469 --> 00:17:04,459
It's a big coincidence seen being out there in the same area. 

201
00:17:04,604 --> 00:17:06,619
Well, it doesn't mean he's guilty of anything. 

202
00:17:06,918 --> 00:17:09,874
I mean maybe he was in the wrong place at the wrong time. 

203
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,461
Do they have any suspects?

204
00:17:12,653 --> 00:17:17,519
No, not yet. The only thing he said was that the killer would probably have scratches on him. 

205
00:17:18,698 --> 00:17:22,413
So, if Kyle was a witness, once his memory comes back, he can identify him.

206
00:17:22,413 --> 00:17:23,230
It's possible. 

207
00:17:23,435 --> 00:17:26,905
Meanwhile, he's living here with us and some murderer can be looking for him. 

208
00:17:27,181 --> 00:17:30,202
Or, he's just a lost boy who needs a temporary home. 

209
00:17:41,283 --> 00:17:42,244
Still at it? 

210
00:17:43,386 --> 00:17:45,606
-Done.
-Excellent. Here you go. 


211
00:17:48,907 --> 00:17:51,777
Not bad, not bad, but I'll have to change a few answers though.

212
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,823
-Change them?
-Well, I can't get them all right, they'll know somebody helped me. 


213
00:17:56,477 --> 00:18:01,603
-I thought it was good to help. 
-It is, but it has to be a secret.


214
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:07,140
-A secret? Is that lying?
-How could it be lying if we're not saying anything. 


215
00:18:39,265 --> 00:18:42,776
-Oh?
-Yes, I showered. I'll be ready in a second.  


216
00:18:42,776 --> 00:18:45,586
-Did you finish your test?
-I did it last night, no sweat.


217
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:54,039
Made the papers, the other night we found Kyle sitting right next to this spot.

218
00:18:54,101 --> 00:18:56,330
O, it's so hard to imagine he's involved.

219
00:18:56,330 --> 00:19:00,397
Even if he's not, we still don't know why he was wandering around in the woods in the first place. 

220
00:19:00,729 --> 00:19:01,747
Vamanos. 

221
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:06,347
Ok, first you showered with no complaint, now you're eager to go to summer school? 

222
00:19:06,347 --> 00:19:09,513
-I could stay home all day.
-O, nice try. Where's Kyle?


223
00:19:10,071 --> 00:19:11,441
Must have left with Lori.

224
00:19:14,592 --> 00:19:17,694
Wow, she actually did something we asked her to. 

225
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:33,560
You ditched out on watching Kyle?

226
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:39,280
My parents told me to take him to work, and I lost my job, remember? 

227
00:19:39,631 --> 00:19:42,565
But your parents would be so pissed when they find out. 

228
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:49,938
Yea, they're probably talking right now about how irresponsible I am and I can never be trusted to watch Kyle again, which is fine by me. 

229
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,566
I'll watch him for you.

230
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,050
Where is Declan already?

231
00:19:59,862 --> 00:20:01,848
It's so cool that we're stalking him. 

232
00:20:03,294 --> 00:20:06,736
We are not stalking him. We are confirming. 

233
00:20:09,354 --> 00:20:12,904
Somehow I can't see him playing nine-holes of golf with his father. 

234
00:20:13,205 --> 00:20:19,260
Look, I don't care if he sees other girls. I just, wish him to be honest with me.

235
00:20:19,816 --> 00:20:25,123
-You are so full of it.
-I can see other guys, too, that's our arrangement.


236
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:29,796
-Quite the open door policy.
-Listen to you, slut central. 


237
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,874
Come on, we both know you like him more than you let on. 

238
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:36,420
That doesn't mean that I expect this big commitment. 

239
00:20:57,822 --> 00:20:59,136
Just the truth. 

240
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:20,807
Hello? 

241
00:21:24,152 --> 00:21:25,063
Stephen? 

242
00:21:28,394 --> 00:21:29,193
Nicole? 

243
00:21:34,118 --> 00:21:35,147
Where are you?

244
00:21:38,641 --> 00:21:44,080
In the family everyone had a place, a purpose, something to contribute. 

245
00:21:44,753 --> 00:21:47,142
Everyone mattered, but me. 

246
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:51,640

They didn't even notice they left me behind. 


247
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:57,742
But then I stumbled on a way to help them, to show them I was useful. 

248
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,636
-How did you do that? 
-What?


249
00:23:27,042 --> 00:23:30,993
-You jumped off the roof.
-I had to get down. 


250
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:34,198
People don't do that, they use ladders. 

251
00:23:37,284 --> 00:23:38,731
I don't get you at all. 

252
00:23:42,728 --> 00:23:46,192
-I am so grounded 
-Your mother will understand.


253
00:23:46,226 --> 00:23:48,561
-Have you met my mom? 
-Yes.


254
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:53,753
-Kyle, obviously she's gonna punish me. 
-You just need to explain.


255
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:56,962
That I saw you jump off the roof? Even I don't believe it. 

256
00:23:57,652 --> 00:24:00,912
-But it's the truth. 
-It doesn't matter. 


257
00:24:03,439 --> 00:24:05,322
I thought the truth always matters.

258
00:24:06,388 --> 00:24:08,603
What's happening here? 

259
00:24:09,963 --> 00:24:12,979
-Are you ok?
-Yea, just a little fender bender with the trash. 


260
00:24:13,607 --> 00:24:17,688
How much trouble am I in? For leaving you behind?

261
00:24:17,795 --> 00:24:19,007
Oh, they don't know. 

262
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:24,389
Come on, we got to get you inside. 

263
00:24:38,147 --> 00:24:42,015
Two thousand square feet, great yard, great schools, beautiful nursery for Zach 

264
00:24:42,015 --> 00:24:45,165
Plus a third bedroom for another kid if we want to have one, which I want to, but 

265
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:49,734
-Chloe's already so tired she can't even imagine. 
-Mark. I know you're excited. 


266
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:51,968
I can't believe they accepted our offer. 

267
00:24:52,135 --> 00:24:54,005
Are you sure this is the right time to buy a house? 

268
00:24:54,128 --> 00:24:57,087
I know. The market is high, it'll be a bit of a stretch.

269
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,680
What? What's going on? 

270
00:25:06,145 --> 00:25:13,253
Well uh, I was just thinking, because of the baby and all, to pack up and move now? 

271
00:25:13,327 --> 00:25:17,616
Stephen, we can't breathe in our place anymore, it's so tight. 

272
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:24,067
-Now is the perfect time to move. 
-Yea. 


273
00:25:43,237 --> 00:25:47,929
-Yes. 
-They found Kern in the woods, along with his card. 


274
00:25:47,929 --> 00:25:49,432
-You were sloppy. 
-I was rushed. 


275
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,039
Have they identified him yet?

276
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,727
-I've made that difficult. 
-Well, it's a matter of time.


277
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:58,946
-Time is what I need to cover my tracks. 
-Do a better job of it. 


278
00:26:06,136 --> 00:26:08,694
Lori, I need clothes! 

279
00:26:18,556 --> 00:26:20,869
Kyle, it's time for you to learn about modesty. 

280
00:26:21,295 --> 00:26:23,230
-I'm not modest?
-No. 


281
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:27,585
And not Jewish either, apparently. 

282
00:26:28,035 --> 00:26:32,098
-So, put on your clothes and come out, we need a cover story. 
-Cover story?


283
00:26:32,456 --> 00:26:36,663
What we tell my parents when they ask us what we did today so they don't know that I lost my job. 

284
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:40,582
-You want me to lie?
-You could put it that way. 


285
00:26:43,773 --> 00:26:46,909
Come on Kyle, you're a guy, lying should come naturally to you. 

286
00:26:47,176 --> 00:26:49,314
-It should?
-Lying's part of your make up. 


287
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:51,764
It doesn't feel like it. 

288
00:26:51,764 --> 00:26:55,127
-Believe me, men lie, it's a fact.
-A fact?


289
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,273
-And what's even worse?
-Something worse?


290
00:26:57,603 --> 00:27:00,358
-Men want women to lie to them, too.
-We do? 


291
00:27:00,405 --> 00:27:06,128
Yes! Because if we dare tell you the truth, if we tried to express how we were truly feeling, men freak them out. 

292
00:27:06,696 --> 00:27:10,104
You'd rather we just keep on lying to you so you don't have to... I don't know, like commit?  

293
00:27:11,766 --> 00:27:14,925
-I don't understand.
-Well, that makes two of us. 


294
00:27:26,154 --> 00:27:28,664
-Hey, Kyle, is Mr. Trager home?
-No. 


295
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:31,394
Um, you won't happen to know if he has any touch of paint? 

296
00:27:31,795 --> 00:27:37,019
For my car? For the fender? Uh not that he'd have any that could match, I mean why would he, but I figured, hey it's worth a shot!

297
00:27:37,179 --> 00:27:38,962
You're talking really fast. 

298
00:27:39,235 --> 00:27:42,762
I'm in full-on freak out mode, I just need something to hide the damage. 

299
00:27:42,891 --> 00:27:45,111
-You want to hide it?
-Till I can fix it. 


300
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:49,064
-What's up? 
-I need to camouflage my car. 


301
00:27:49,248 --> 00:27:53,340
-Just tell her it was parked and someone nailed it.
-You think?


302
00:27:53,434 --> 00:27:58,332
Well, yea. If you tell her what really happened, you're screwed, it's a no-win situation. 

303
00:28:00,106 --> 00:28:06,542
Mom, I'm so sorry, I don't know what happened, I've been so careful. 
Just like that, she'll forget all about being mad. 


304
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:09,271
I thought you said men were the liars.

305
00:28:11,305 --> 00:28:13,117
I don't know, I'm a terrible liar. 

306
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,350
Why don't we see if we can find something to fix it. 

307
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:22,339
Well, my way was better. 

308
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:27,983
God, what am I doing? I don't even know what we're looking for. 

309
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:29,729
My mom's gonna be coronary. 

310
00:28:31,522 --> 00:28:33,441
Maybe you can just wait until Stephen gets home. 

311
00:28:35,073 --> 00:28:38,244
I don't have time, my mom's gonna be home in an hour. 

312
00:28:39,187 --> 00:28:41,542
Maybe I could just park it in the hedge so she won't notice. 

313
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,164
Maybe she won't be that angry.

314
00:28:43,164 --> 00:28:47,894
Kyle, she got me that car so I'd be responsible. What is she gonna say if she found out I crashed it in one week. 

315
00:28:48,052 --> 00:28:49,766
What will happen when she finds out?

316
00:28:49,835 --> 00:28:56,468
Well, she'll take away my car, my social life, besides that nothing, you know, except a long exile to my room. 

317
00:28:56,999 --> 00:28:58,549
I think you should tell her.

318
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:02,769
Not telling her is making you feel worse. 

319
00:29:05,381 --> 00:29:08,707
-Wish me luck.
-How do I do that?


320
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:13,029
-You just say, "Good luck." 
-Good luck! 


321
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,571
So Kyle got to go to the coffee shop today, how'd it go, Lori? Any problems? 

322
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:33,133
No, it was great. 

323
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:37,629
He just sat there at the counter and drew the whole time, just like you said he would. 

324
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:41,501
How'd you like it there Kyle? 

325
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,788
It was so hard to look Nicole in the eye. 

326
00:29:46,714 --> 00:29:50,207
I think he was lonely, it's probably not the best place for him. 

327
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,625
I can take Kyle to school with me. 

328
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:58,580
He'll sit right by me, and read along, it'll be fun, right Kyle? 

329
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:01,063
My mouth began to feel dry. 

330
00:30:01,843 --> 00:30:05,335
It's not supposed to be fun, Josh, by the way, how'd your test go?

331
00:30:06,395 --> 00:30:07,230
I passed. 

332
00:30:09,397 --> 00:30:11,660
Yea, all that hard work really paid off. 

333
00:30:12,314 --> 00:30:17,955
They spun their stories with ease and conviction, by staying silent, was I lying too? 

334
00:30:18,486 --> 00:30:19,731
Are you sure you didn't cheat? 

335
00:30:20,016 --> 00:30:21,747
I could feel my heart pound. 

336
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:24,217
Lori, just be happy Josh is doing well.

337
00:30:24,349 --> 00:30:27,692
Hey, mom, you think maybe I could uh play some video games tonight? 

338
00:30:29,576 --> 00:30:31,307
Yea, I think you've earned a reward. 

339
00:30:32,173 --> 00:30:34,402
Until finally I couldn't take it anymore. 

340
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,334
I took the test for Josh. 

341
00:30:38,953 --> 00:30:40,758
-I knew it!
-He's lying!


342
00:30:40,957 --> 00:30:45,348
It's the truth, and I wasn't at the coffee bar, I was here all by myself. 

343
00:30:45,384 --> 00:30:47,411
-Shut up, Kyle! 
-Why didn't you take him?


344
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:51,124
-I got fired, ok? Thanks a lot. 
-Yea, Kyle. I thought you were my friend. 


345
00:30:52,061 --> 00:30:53,644
I never wanted you to begin with. 

346
00:30:56,394 --> 00:30:59,238
-Kyle, they don't mean that. 
-Now, you did the right thing. 


347
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,267
Then why does it feel so wrong?

348
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:36,640
-How'd you get up here?
-Climbed. 


349
00:31:37,613 --> 00:31:39,466
Climbed? Wow. 

350
00:31:45,506 --> 00:31:54,560
Nice up here, private, out of the way. 

351
00:31:56,932 --> 00:32:00,217
-I'm in the way.
-No, that's not true.


352
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:04,265
-Yes.
-No, Lori and Josh didn't mean what they said. 


353
00:32:07,833 --> 00:32:09,694
All I wanted to do was help them. 

354
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:14,794
Lying's not the way, like I told you, tell the truth, no matter what.

355
00:32:18,003 --> 00:32:22,901
-Telling the truth can hurt.
-Yea, sometimes. 


356
00:32:25,432 --> 00:32:27,884
You just still shouldn't lie, just to protect people.

357
00:32:28,895 --> 00:32:33,759
But allowing people to be hurt? Is that alright?

358
00:32:57,114 --> 00:32:57,832
Hey. 

359
00:33:00,671 --> 00:33:02,590
I'm sorry, I didn't watch Kyle. 

360
00:33:03,169 --> 00:33:05,947
-I guess I was afraid to tell you guys I got fired. 
-Why?


361
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:11,231
-Why did I get fired or why was I afraid to tell you?
-Well, take your pick. 


362
00:33:12,969 --> 00:33:16,681
I blew off a shift, and I know it was wrong, so please mom, spare me the lecture. 

363
00:33:17,134 --> 00:33:18,053
Lori 

364
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:28,134
I hope you know, you can tell me anything, now I'm not just saying that, just¡­ 

365
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:31,502
Whatever you're going through, I have a feeling I've been there too. 

366
00:33:32,829 --> 00:33:35,257
Is this one of those, when I was your age speeches?

367
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:39,897
Well, the fact is, I was your age once, not that long ago. 

368
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:43,803
Some styles may have changed, but, the basics. 

369
00:33:46,106 --> 00:33:48,113
I think I still have a pretty good handle on it.

370
00:33:49,649 --> 00:33:53,346
Did you ever wish that somebody felt the way that you did?

371
00:33:53,815 --> 00:33:54,776
Which time? 

372
00:33:59,813 --> 00:34:00,948
One thing I've learned. 

373
00:34:02,241 --> 00:34:05,039
You can't make anybody feel the way you'd like them to. 

374
00:34:06,821 --> 00:34:09,609
If they do, it's wonderful. 

375
00:34:11,002 --> 00:34:14,471
And if they don't, you move on. 

376
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:28,536
-Brad, Stephen. 
-What's up?


377
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,699
First thing in the morning I'm telling the staff about the layoffs.

378
00:34:32,727 --> 00:34:36,132
-You can't do that.
-Well, they deserve to know that truth. 


379
00:34:36,251 --> 00:34:39,841
-If you say anything Trager¡­ 
-What, you'll fire me too? 


380
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:43,965
You won't have to. I'll quit, and I'll take all my software and my patents with me. 

381
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,529
Alright, don't get carried away. 

382
00:34:49,385 --> 00:34:52,868
-Come in tomorrow, and you can break the bad news to them. 
-Bye. 


383
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:03,154
-I can explain. 
-I trusted you with this car, Amanda. 


384
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:06,800
-You promised to be careful. 
-It was an accident, I'm sorry. 


385
00:35:06,983 --> 00:35:09,532
-What happened?
-I was¡­


386
00:35:09,713 --> 00:35:13,742
-I did it. I broke the car. 
-What are you doing? 


387
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:19,858
-That's not what happened!
-Do not cover for him, Amanda. 


388
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:22,115
-I'm not, he's lying. 
-It's the truth. 


389
00:35:23,981 --> 00:35:30,586
Ok, you listen to me very carefully. 
I want you to stay away from my property, and my daughter. 


390
00:35:33,829 --> 00:35:34,688
Come on, Amanda.

391
00:35:39,344 --> 00:35:40,308
Now? 

392
00:35:44,844 --> 00:35:49,767
This lie was easy, because I knew it was the right thing to do. 

393
00:35:54,368 --> 00:35:56,813
-Surfing for porn?
-I wish. 


394
00:35:57,784 --> 00:36:01,230
No internet, no x-box for a week, you?

395
00:36:01,557 --> 00:36:06,314
-I got the mature discussion.
-So not fair. 


396
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:21,001
Kyle, I completely suck. 

397
00:36:22,441 --> 00:36:26,001
I didn't mean what I said, and I should never have asked you to cover for me. 

398
00:36:26,001 --> 00:36:28,283
-Ha, lie for you.
-Zip it, cheater.


399
00:36:28,456 --> 00:36:33,463
-Hey, if you're gonna apologize, make it accurate. 
-At least I'm apologizing.


400
00:36:39,782 --> 00:36:40,614
I'm sorry. 

401
00:36:42,439 --> 00:36:44,124
-We got busted. 
-Josh!


402
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:52,117
-And uh, you can still be my friend. 
-You are so unbelievably lame. 


403
00:36:52,125 --> 00:36:55,777
It's ok, I think I understand about lying now. 

404
00:36:56,094 --> 00:37:01,238
We will never ask you to lie for us again, but can we trust you not to narc?

405
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,159
To keep things just between us. 

406
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:10,767
You can trust me. 

407
00:37:15,693 --> 00:37:18,283
I think we've all learned a very valuable lesson today. 

408
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,236
All set.

409
00:37:29,785 --> 00:37:32,760
You're sure about this, you don't mind giving it up?

410
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:36,487
I hardly ever use it anymore, besides, it's important for Kyle. 

411
00:37:36,663 --> 00:37:39,718
Mom! Dad! I need you!

412
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,904
Kyle! Come on already. 

413
00:37:46,226 --> 00:37:51,376
-Kyle lock the door again?
-Not for long. Ta-da! 


414
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,441
-Too bad they don't give As for breaking and entering.
-And theft. 


415
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,290
-I didn't charge anything on it. 
-Shouldn't you be studying? 


416
00:37:58,362 --> 00:37:59,047
I will!

417
00:37:59,066 --> 00:38:02,656
If you don't pass that test on your own this time, I'll tell the school you cheated.

418
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:04,153
My own mother? 

419
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,546
I can't wait for Kyle to wake up every morning so I can take a shower.

420
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:11,326
Well, you're not gonna have to worry about that anymore.

421
00:38:11,428 --> 00:38:14,668
-Why?
-Uh, just use our shower today, I'll tell you later. 


422
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:19,789
-And when you're done, you're on the clock.
-Uggh, when's my first break? 


423
00:38:21,727 --> 00:38:24,067
You sure paying her to watch Kyle is a good idea?

424
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:26,312
She needs a job, he needs supervision. 

425
00:38:29,871 --> 00:38:32,825
Kyle, time to get up. 

426
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:42,219
Got a surprise for you. 

427
00:38:52,227 --> 00:38:54,692
Ok, open them. 

428
00:39:12,356 --> 00:39:14,039
What do you think?

429
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:30,348
What happened to the workshop?

430
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:35,063
It's not my workshop anymore, it's your room. 

431
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,226
-Mine?
-All yours. 


432
00:39:42,429 --> 00:39:43,484
Do you like it?

433
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:51,948
In that moment, I felt I finally had a place here, I belong. 

434
00:40:00,245 --> 00:40:04,357
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. 


435
00:40:12,122 --> 00:40:14,890
So, let's go get some breakfast. 

436
00:40:15,042 --> 00:40:17,365
Oh, you guys go on, I'm going to set up a little.
