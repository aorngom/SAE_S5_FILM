1
00:00:12,888 --> 00:00:15,140
My birth was unconventional at best.

2
00:00:20,646 --> 00:00:23,065
My first memory was waking up in the forest.

3
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:28,529
Like a newborn baby, I had no idea who I was or what was happening.

4
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:36,495
My eyes weren't sure what they were seeing.

5
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,295
Every sight, sound, and feeling was unfamiliar.

6
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,967
Every species is born with instincts that ultimately create a balance with nature.

7
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,516
Every species, except the one I was born into.

11
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:06,793
I came across a beast with two voices.

12
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:10,964
I was thankful to have found a companion.

13
00:02:33,237 --> 00:02:34,029
Comon, sweetie.

14
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,116
Freak!

15
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,790
Show's over, kid.

16
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,749
What's your name?

17
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,170
Who...are...you?

18
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:06,687
Soon I was taken to a new place with fences and sad faces.

19
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,257
<i>Note to self</i>

20
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,885
<i>Be erect by half-past 10</i>

21
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,720
<i>Be strong, be proud...</i>

22
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,596
Lori!

23
00:03:46,018 --> 00:03:46,727
Lori!

24
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,522
Are you getting up?

25
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,274
Declan!

26
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:59,448
Let's all have breakfast together for a change!

27
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:00,782
I'm making pancakes.

28
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,078
I think you've slept long enough.

29
00:04:08,123 --> 00:04:10,417
[PHONE RINGING]

30
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:12,586
Whew!

31
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:20,302
We, uh--we didn't get to finish what we started.

32
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:21,762
You need to get out of here.

33
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:25,849
Later, Trager.

34
00:04:30,896 --> 00:04:32,314
Lou, you're not disturbing me.

35
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:33,690
What's going on?

36
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:36,109
[Lou] I got someone here I know you're going to want to meet.

37
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,655
The kid showed up here this morning and he's right up your alley.

38
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,157
In other words, no one else wants to treat him.

39
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:43,492
No, no, it's not like that.

40
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:47,829
Nobody knows where he came from exactly, but he seems sharp and he's...

41
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,208
Look, you gotta see him for yourself.

42
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,835
I'll stop by at 10:00 tomorrow.

43
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:55,003
Lo, um, this afternoon okay?

44
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:58,757
I'm on my way.

45
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,555
Ah, it's alive!

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,764
Bite me.

47
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:06,765
No, thanks.

48
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:07,850
That's Declan's job.

49
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,268
Shut up, dweeb!

50
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:09,893
Declan?

51
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,436
What happened to Mike Suby?

52
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:14,982
Old news. Declan's her new flavor of the month.

53
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,317
Or the week, in Miss Skanky's case.

54
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,235
Knock it off.

55
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,820
So, who's this Declan guy?

56
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:20,863
He's just a friend.

57
00:05:20,863 --> 00:05:22,322
He's having a party this week.

58
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,490
Can I take the car?

59
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:24,449
We'll see.

60
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,035
Sorry, guys. I have to go out for a bit.

61
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:28,203
Go out?

62
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:29,413
Lou Daniels just called.

63
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,581
Nicole, it's Sunday.

64
00:05:30,664 --> 00:05:33,333
I know, but it's urgent and it sounds like a really special case.

65
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,668
They always do.

66
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:37,087
Save some pancakes for me, okay?

67
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,813
Yeah, let's roll, man.

68
00:05:57,191 --> 00:06:02,279
For some reason, the more people I saw, the more alone I felt.

69
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,202
Yo, let's get some juice down here.

70
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,332
'Sup? Everyone taking stupid pills around here?

71
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:14,333
Juice me!

72
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,731
Most of our time is spent trying to lessen the pains of life.

73
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,360
I was about to learn how to quash hunger.

74
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,970
See something you like, punk?

75
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,264
You gonna see my fist if you don't quit eyeballing me.

76
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,141
Kick his ass, man.

77
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,149
Be cool, Skeeter.

78
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,110
He can't understand a word you say.

79
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,862
He ain't dissin' you, man.

80
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,281
A'ight.

81
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,324
He keeps staring at me,

82
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,369
I'm gonna have to kick his sorry ass.

83
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:39,084
I had no reason to fear this person,
but he reminded me of the snake in the woods, just before it struck.

84
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:11,533
I was glad to see a familiar face,
but a pressure below my waist was bothering me.

85
00:08:19,124 --> 00:08:20,501
Come on, show me what you got.

86
00:08:22,628 --> 00:08:23,170
Come on, put your hands up!

87
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:23,879
Put 'em up!

88
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,965
You ain't tough, new kid.

89
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:27,799
Come on, put em' up!

90
00:08:28,717 --> 00:08:29,092
Come on!

91
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,680
[Boy] Knock him out, Skeeter!

92
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:45,317
I wanted to learn his game,
but the pain in my belly was getting more intense.

93
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:51,615
Hey!

94
00:08:55,827 --> 00:09:04,211
I barely noticed the discomfort on my face because inside me,
something had flipped and I began to feel wonderful.

95
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:05,921
[Lou] Great job, guys!

96
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,923
No rec privileges for a week.

97
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,466
Now get out of here!

98
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,134
Now!

99
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,054
Everybody out!

100
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,068
Hey,  Nicole.

101
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:30,112
Thanks for coming by to see him.

102
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:31,446
Does "him" have a name?

103
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,658
The paperwork says "John Doe» for the time being.

104
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,868
John Doe.

105
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:38,370
What's a handsome boy like that doing with a dead man's name?

106
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,748
You know he kind of reminds me of my brother Kyle.

107
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,210
He got all the looks in the family.

108
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:47,087
That's perfect.

109
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,338
Kyle.

110
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,093
Y eah.

111
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,930
Can't speak a word, but damned if he doesn't know what you're saying.

112
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,976
I'll be outside if you need me.

113
00:10:01,018 --> 00:10:01,476
Okay.

114
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,880
I wanted to show her where I'd come from and what I had seen.

115
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,151
So let me understand.

116
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:55,989
The boy has no family that you know of, he doesn't communicate, and he was found just wandering alone in the city?

117
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:57,991
That's all his "Booked Into Shelter" folder said.

118
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:00,369
No Amber Alerts, no missing persons report, nothing.

119
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,497
But there is one more things you should see.

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,126
No belly button.

121
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,675
They're never gonna go for this.

122
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,676
It's just for a few days.

123
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,344
-Finally. I'm starving!

124
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:18,387
-Did you get lo mein?

125
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:19,680
Hold on a minute.

126
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,848
Your mom's got something to talk to you about.

127
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:26,395
I have a new patient, and the place where he's staying isn't safe, so I'm bringing him here for a little while.

128
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,814
You mean some mental patient's going to live in our house?

129
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,357
He's not a mental patient.

130
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,609
He's a very sweet, very special boy.

131
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,027
I know what "very special" means.

132
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,320
He'll probably drool all over the house.

133
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,449
I have to say, I have thought--I'd hoped
that you would both show a little compassion.

134
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,534
You don't even know this kid.

135
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:41,618
I don't want him touching my things.

136
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,786
All right, that's enough.

137
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,164
If your mom says he's coming, he's coming and that's final.

138
00:11:56,717 --> 00:12:00,429
<i>So you're born on the cusp</i>

139
00:12:00,429 --> 00:12:03,432
<i>Or it's a run of bad luck</i>

140
00:12:04,183 --> 00:12:06,685
<i>But it's bigger than us...</i>

141
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,103
This is it.

142
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:09,396
Home.

143
00:12:12,441 --> 00:12:17,070
Where you're gonna be staying for a few days, at least until I can...

144
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:29,750
[Kyle] My first thought was that flat,
tiny people must be living in the walls.

145
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,545
But then I understood.

146
00:12:34,213 --> 00:12:38,634
Humans grow smaller as they develop and pretty soon,
I'd be shrinking, myself.

147
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:48,852
Maybe one day this woman would hold me, too.

148
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:03,283
The images made my mind explode with complex mathematical formulae.

149
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:06,286
Would you like to play a game, Kyle?

150
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:07,162
Here.

151
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,624
Lots of kids have tons of fun with this one.

152
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,837
This is called a mouse.

153
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,089
When you move it, this arrow--

154
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,053
Hello there.

155
00:13:23,053 --> 00:13:24,388
-[phone ringing]
-I am a bird.

156
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:26,515
I fly high into the sky.

157
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,600
Touch the sky and watch me fly.

158
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,269
-Hello?
-How'd it go? Did you bring him home?

159
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,187
Oh, he's just great. He's on the computer right now.

160
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:34,398
Do you need me there? Could be a lot to handle.

161
00:13:34,398 --> 00:13:36,066
Trust me, honey, I'll be fine.

162
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,818
Look at the house.

163
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:40,320
Getting a little old for Barney, aren't we, Josh?

164
00:13:43,574 --> 00:13:47,119
[Kyle] When I saw her, I realized something was horribly wrong.

165
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:51,415
Humans grow larger over time, not smaller.

166
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:54,877
It bothered me. Wasn't I ever small?

167
00:13:55,502 --> 00:13:57,004
Why didn't you tell me he was in the house?

168
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,130
I think he saw my boobs!

169
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:00,674
What did she-- Did he just--

170
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:02,384
Stephen, I promise, we're fine.

171
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:04,011
I've got another call. I've gotta go.

172
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:16,565
Our top story in Trebourne County:
a teenage girl washed up on shore this morning,
having no memory whatsoever of how she got there.

173
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:19,026
[Computer] Fractions, fractions, all done!

174
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,360
Yum yum!

175
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:21,695
How much blood?

176
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:23,363
Okay, I'm on my way.

177
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,617
Listen, there’s an emergency at work.

178
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:27,492
I need you to watch Kyle.

179
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,536
-Sure, Mom.
-I'm serious!

180
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,454
Watch him.

181
00:14:31,288 --> 00:14:32,122
I'll be right back.

182
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:37,794
H ello?

183
00:14:38,754 --> 00:14:39,755
Oh, hi, Hillary.

184
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:44,092
No, Declan still hasn't called, and if he's with Jessica, he's probably got the clap by now.

185
00:14:45,469 --> 00:14:48,764
You know me. I felt weird when Mike Suby put his hand down my pants.

186
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,018
Because all I could think about were these warts on his hand.

187
00:14:54,186 --> 00:14:55,354
That could be him!

188
00:14:55,771 --> 00:14:57,147
If I don't click over, you'll know why.

189
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:00,901
Hello?

190
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:02,903
Oh, hi, Declan.

191
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:05,197
No, I wasn't talking to anyone. What's up?

192
00:15:06,615 --> 00:15:09,785
[laughter] I know.

193
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:20,128
[Kyle] It was the most beautiful sound in the world.

194
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,856
It was part mathematics and part... euphoria.

195
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:56,456
I felt certain that whatever this was, was a gift to the world, meant to fill all that heard it with a flood of emotion.

196
00:15:59,168 --> 00:16:00,878
[Woman] Amanda, I'm home!

197
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:09,636
It then struck me that not everyone could appreciate this miracle.

198
00:16:10,345 --> 00:16:13,265
The sound increased my sorrow for those who could not hear it.

199
00:16:32,284 --> 00:16:34,036
There was a pounding in my chest.

200
00:16:34,411 --> 00:16:39,708
My face felt like it was burning, and more than anything,
I wanted to disappear.

201
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:11,615
Aah! Aah!

202
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,871
Run, Mom! There's a psycho in the shower!

203
00:17:25,629 --> 00:17:26,880
It's okay, Josh.

204
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,965
It's okay.

205
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,134
This is Kyle, the special boy I was telling you about.

206
00:17:31,385 --> 00:17:34,346
If he's supposed to be so special, why'd you stick him in the bathtub?

207
00:17:35,514 --> 00:17:37,307
Nice to meet you... perv.

208
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:42,271
The reason I am letting that slide is because I have a favor to ask of you.

209
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:46,066
I would like Kyle to bunk down in your room for a couple nights.

210
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,067
Are you kidding?

211
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:49,152
This guy's got "bed wetter" written all over him.

212
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,529
Well, I'm only asking.

213
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:55,284
Fine.

214
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:57,452
But you better bustle out the rubber sheets.

215
00:17:57,536 --> 00:18:00,289
Have you seen Lori? She was supposed to be watching him.

216
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,875
Some teacher called with test results...

217
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,377
Mrs....Planny Parenthood.

218
00:18:05,669 --> 00:18:10,174
I  was beginning to sense that my very presence was turning these people against each other.

219
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:15,888
You and I are gonna have a talk.

220
00:18:16,305 --> 00:18:18,599
Oh, no. Did something happen to Kyle?

221
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,226
Oh, you mean besides him going outside by himself?

222
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:25,647
You can forget about Declan's party.

223
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:40,579
<i>Look out your front door, there's a ship coming in...</i>

224
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,166
Hi, honey.

225
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,252
Hey, something wrong with Lori? She seems upset about something.

226
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,297
She's just having a difficult time understanding what responsibility means.

227
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:50,797
Oh.

228
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,424
Is this the, uh...?

229
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:55,260
Kyle, this is my husband Stephen.

230
00:18:55,344 --> 00:18:56,720
Honey, this is Kyle.

231
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,889
Hello, Kyle.

232
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:05,395
[slowly] I'm happy to make your acquaintance.

233
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:08,899
Can he understand a single thing I'm saying?

234
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:09,775
I don't think so.

235
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,944
Well, at least he doesn't look dangerous.

236
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,655
Oh! Watch it, watch it!

237
00:19:14,988 --> 00:19:16,990
It's hot! Hot! Ouch!

238
00:19:17,032 --> 00:19:18,242
Ow, ow, ow!

239
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,869
This being was clearly a superior communicator.

240
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:26,917
I somehow understood everything it said and wondered
why others chose to speak so ineffectively.

241
00:19:33,882 --> 00:19:38,220
You know, this neighborhood isn't zoned for halfway houses

242
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:39,721
Oh, good evening, by the way.

243
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:40,639
Excuse me?

244
00:19:41,014 --> 00:19:43,475
One of your challenged cases broke into my--

245
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:44,518
He didn't break in, Mom.

246
00:19:45,102 --> 00:19:50,190
Broke into my house this afternoon and snuck up on Amanda while she was alone.

247
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,235
Who knows what could've happened if I hadn't come home when I did.

248
00:19:53,277 --> 00:19:55,487
I'm so sorry, Carol.

249
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,323
Lori was responsible for watching Kyle this afternoon--

250
00:19:58,407 --> 00:20:01,493
Nicole, I would hate to make this into a police matter...

251
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,916
Come along, Amanda.

252
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:11,712
I'll see ya later!

253
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,303
It's not fair, Dad.

254
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:20,179
I was in the next room.

255
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,514
It's not like I left him alone with Michael Jackson.

256
00:20:23,432 --> 00:20:26,226
There are over 800,000 words in the English language.

257
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:30,856
The eyes, however, speak a more precise code, through their narrowing...

258
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,482
We're not running a reject farm, are we?

259
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:33,066
Josh.

260
00:20:33,442 --> 00:20:41,033
...brow arches, dilations, blinking, or the asymmetrical closure, which I hadn't yet deciphered.

261
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,202
Don't you think this Mirae Worker trip's getting out of hand?

262
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,331
Cool it, guys. What did we say about giving your mom some latitude over the next couple of days?

263
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,252
I was suffering from thirst, but my language skills were relatively primitive,

264
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:55,380
so I relied on phrases I'd memorized at the children's home.

265
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,550
Yo! Let's get some juice down here!

266
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:07,351
'Sup? Everyone taking stupid pills around here?

267
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,519
Juice me!

268
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,527
Oh mum, he's like that Indian from Cuckoo's Nest.

269
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:19,071
Wait. Did he just learn to talk in one day?

270
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:21,657
No. Lori, that's impossible.

271
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:23,992
Right, honey?

272
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,953
Can you understand me, Kyle?

273
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,371
Go on, do it again.

274
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:29,122
Mom, is that how you talk to a dog?

275
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:30,457
"Go on, do it again"?

276
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:32,209
Watch this.

277
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:34,294
Kyle, speak!

278
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,339
I felt weird when Mike Suby put his hand down my pants

279
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:40,717
because all I could think about were these warts on his hand.

280
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:50,686
It's amazing. Autism typically involves mimicry, but Kyle isn't emotionally withdrawn.

281
00:21:50,519 --> 00:21:52,229
His behaviors aren't fixated.

282
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,314
So,  can he understand us or not?

283
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:55,774
I can't say.

284
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:58,110
I've never dealt with anyone like him before.

285
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:01,154
Suby. Ha, nice one!

286
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,533
I can't wait to test him.

287
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,451
Why haven't the police found anything?

288
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,452
He's full of surprises.

289
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,371
Somebody has to be missing this kid.

290
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,165
Well, so far, no one's filed a report.

291
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:14,543
The whole thing is really strange.

292
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:17,462
Oh, even stranger, he doesn't have a belly button.

293
00:22:18,297 --> 00:22:19,339
No belly button.

294
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:20,507
I saw for myself.

295
00:22:20,007 --> 00:22:22,217
Kyle's stomach is totally smooth.

296
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,136
Well, how could that be?

297
00:22:24,136 --> 00:22:25,304
He's extraordinary.

298
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:27,806
Nicole, you said just a few days.

299
00:22:28,724 --> 00:22:30,475
Well, I'm not sending him back to that facility.

300
00:22:30,851 --> 00:22:32,603
You are so wrapped up in this kid.

301
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,354
He can't stay here indefinitely.

302
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:35,063
I know.

303
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:38,442
Social Services promised to find a safe spot for him by Monday.

304
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:40,319
Monday?

305
00:22:41,361 --> 00:22:41,820
Monday.

306
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:04,176
Come on, boys, let's get to work.

307
00:23:17,981 --> 00:23:19,608
Whoa, slow down, Rainman.

308
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,194
I haven't even finished grading the last one.

309
00:23:22,027 --> 00:23:22,486
You're kidding.

310
00:23:22,528 --> 00:23:24,196
That was an hour-long test.

311
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,281
How long did it take him, five minutes?

312
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:29,159
Yeah, and he got them all right.

313
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,414
What is this kid, seriously?

314
00:23:36,667 --> 00:23:37,751
Freaky

315
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,839
Hello, Dr. Fields, please.

316
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:47,678
Try not to move, Kyle.

317
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:56,186
Oh, damn.

318
00:23:56,270 --> 00:24:00,691
-When's  the last time you had this calibrated, at least for a week?
-It's fine! I ran two MRIs this morning.

319
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:01,441
You blind?

320
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:02,651
Look, it's a mess.

321
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:03,318
What is it?

322
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:04,778
Uh, equipment's on the fritz.

323
00:24:04,945 --> 00:24:06,697
You see this red area here?

324
00:24:06,488 --> 00:24:08,490
That's supposed to represent the active point of the brain.

325
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:09,867
Yeah. So?

326
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:11,952
You and I use maybe 7% of our brains.

327
00:24:12,202 --> 00:24:13,412
All right? Any given time.

328
00:24:13,495 --> 00:24:15,706
Einstein used 9% of his brain.

329
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:16,748
Rupert here uses 2%.

330
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:20,127
So it means he's some super genius?

331
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:21,545
No, it means mechanical failure.

332
00:24:21,837 --> 00:24:22,880
You're gonna have to come back some other time.

333
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,339
What if the machine's right?

334
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:34,141
Well, hypothetically speaking, with this type of neural hyperactivity,
he'd be prone to all sorts of seizures, strokes, tumors--

335
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:35,684
-Tu-tumors

336
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,905
Well, it's been a busy day, huh, kiddo?

337
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:50,824
Good night, Kyle.

338
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:52,201
Sweet dreams.

339
00:25:29,571 --> 00:25:30,447
Hey, dude.

340
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:33,116
You're not gonna wig out on me, right?

341
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:39,623
I mean, if something weird starts to happen,
like you foam at the mouth, don't do it here.

342
00:25:40,707 --> 00:25:41,917
Go get my mom.

343
00:25:48,131 --> 00:25:49,508
Damn, I miss Charlotte.

344
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:56,974
Charlotte's Miss Playpen, dude.

345
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,350
The magazine.

346
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,352
My mom hid her.

347
00:26:02,354 --> 00:26:03,105
Where?

348
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:06,608
I know not, my brother.

349
00:26:08,652 --> 00:26:09,820
I know not.

350
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:15,344
Here.

351
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:16,553
You're gonna need that.

352
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,721
What's wrong?

353
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,473
First drink, then talk.

354
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:20,766
[gasp] Hi!

355
00:27:22,643 --> 00:27:23,685
Ooh.

356
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:31,610
<i>Turn the FM off the AM frequency</i>

357
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:34,488
<i>It's the sound that cannot stop...</i>

358
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,076
[Kyle] An ancient ceremony was underway that involved spastic gyrations.

359
00:27:39,868 --> 00:27:42,454
The heat made me sweat, and I needed something to drink.

360
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,081
Who's that?

361
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,958
I don't know, but he's cute.

362
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,709
So spill it, already.

363
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:50,003
Huh? Oh.

364
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,506
I hope you weren't too set on hooking up with Declan tonight.

365
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,132
<i>Hey, beer bong!</i>

366
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:55,050
<i>Who's next?</i>

367
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:57,928
<i>- Whoo!
- Maybe I don't want to know after all.</i>

368
00:27:58,512 --> 00:28:00,430
Yeah. Then I wouldn't go in there.

369
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:08,897
[Boy] Chug, chug, chug, chug!
Chug, chug, chug, chug!

370
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:35,174
[Kyle] At the children's home, the other captives referred to a strange place.

371
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:39,469
I finally realized I'd arrived... in hell.

372
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,907
The appearance of an unknown enemy had begun to agitate the group.

373
00:29:00,157 --> 00:29:01,074
The party's over!

374
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:02,743
Hold it right there!

375
00:29:08,123 --> 00:29:09,374
Wait for Katie.

376
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:10,584
I can't find her.

377
00:29:12,628 --> 00:29:14,213
I dropped my phone!

378
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:20,052
-Relax.
-I didn't do anything.

379
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,019
Whoa, snap!

380
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:29,811
Did you see that?

381
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:31,063
[Boy] Whoa! He's gonna cut himself.

382
00:29:31,271 --> 00:29:33,273
...just walked into the window!

383
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,571
-Get back here.
-Ow.

384
00:29:39,613 --> 00:29:41,490
-Leave her alone!
-Let her go!

385
00:29:42,032 --> 00:29:43,700
She didn't do anything.

386
00:29:44,743 --> 00:29:45,994
Cool it, kid. You're fried.

387
00:29:47,704 --> 00:29:50,332
I remembered how the snake had tried to frighten me.

388
00:30:47,306 --> 00:30:50,142
I hoped this creature would have as much sense as the snake.

389
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:09,495
[cheering]

390
00:31:52,871 --> 00:31:54,706
I...am....

391
00:31:55,415 --> 00:31:56,375
leaking.

392
00:31:57,251 --> 00:31:59,586
My God, what happened to you?

393
00:32:05,676 --> 00:32:06,593
I don't know, Mom.

394
00:32:06,718 --> 00:32:09,721
There's no blood on any doors, and the windows ain't broken or nothin'.

395
00:32:09,638 --> 00:32:10,848
That's okay, hon.

396
00:32:10,806 --> 00:32:12,391
We'll figure it out tomorrow.

397
00:32:12,224 --> 00:32:13,517
The images reminded me.

398
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:15,477
I had no memory of ever being small.

399
00:32:26,905 --> 00:32:30,075
What...am I?

400
00:32:32,286 --> 00:32:39,251
Well, Kyle, that's a difficult question to answer.

401
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:48,177
You're a boy, a special boy, and boys are...human beings.

402
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:55,517
Even with years of historical research, the more humans try to define
themselves, the more they drown in their own confusion.

403
00:32:55,142 --> 00:32:57,686
That's the evolutionist point of view.

404
00:33:01,398 --> 00:33:04,151
You... know not.

405
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:20,751
Now this one.

406
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,379
It'll help you detox.

407
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:25,923
Forget it.

408
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:28,300
One more sip and this place becomes a barfatorium.

409
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:34,014
Focus on something else... like, say, your knight in shining armor.

410
00:33:34,556 --> 00:33:35,599
What?

411
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:36,892
Don't give me that.

412
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,728
The guy who saved your ass last night.

413
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:44,691
The guy with all the Jackie Chan moves.

414
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:48,278
The guy who carried you home.

415
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:50,322
Oh, my God.

416
00:33:50,906 --> 00:33:51,657
Kyle!

417
00:33:52,199 --> 00:33:53,867
I thought I dreamt that.

418
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,578
So, does your dream have digits?

419
00:33:56,495 --> 00:33:57,871
Yeah, mine.

420
00:33:58,497 --> 00:34:00,666
Remember that short bus kid I told you about?

421
00:34:10,592 --> 00:34:11,635
Hi, babe.

422
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,975
[Kyle] Apparently, not all forms of greetings are appropriate.
- Oh! Kyle!

423
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:19,476
You scared me.

424
00:34:22,062 --> 00:34:24,356
What is... "scared"?

425
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:29,444
Oh. Scared...is...fear.

426
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:31,905
Like, "Aah!"

427
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:38,078
I get...scared.

428
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:40,497
What?

429
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:42,416
What are you scared of?

430
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:06,356
Ev...erything.

431
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:12,279
I don't know what...

432
00:35:14,114 --> 00:35:24,791
Kyle, I can't imagine how strange and scary the world
must feel to you right now, but it will get better.

433
00:35:25,459 --> 00:35:26,668
I swear.

434
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:38,514
Help...me...Mom.

435
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,987
I'm gonna take care of you, Kyle.

436
00:35:56,323 --> 00:35:57,533
I promise.

437
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:01,662
Hey.

438
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:03,622
I can't believe I offered to fix their computer.

439
00:36:03,664 --> 00:36:06,041
Their hard drive's fried and their family photos are on it.

440
00:36:06,208 --> 00:36:07,668
I think Tim's mug scared it.

441
00:36:08,919 --> 00:36:10,087
You'll figure it out.

442
00:36:10,087 --> 00:36:11,171
You always do.

443
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:11,839
Yeah.

444
00:36:12,631 --> 00:36:14,174
-Stephen.
-Yeah?

445
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:16,468
I can't do it.

446
00:36:16,593 --> 00:36:18,053
I can't send Kyle away.

447
00:36:18,554 --> 00:36:19,263
Nicole.

448
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:20,973
Not the way he is now.

449
00:36:20,848 --> 00:36:22,099
We talked about this.

450
00:36:22,099 --> 00:36:22,850
We agreed.

451
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:28,897
He's just so vulnerable, and even the best facilities can't give Kyle enough individual care and attention.

452
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:30,691
What are you gonna do, drop all your other cases?

453
00:36:30,858 --> 00:36:35,154
You're already consumed by your work, and now you want to treat your patients at home?

454
00:36:35,154 --> 00:36:36,321
Just this one.

455
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,782
There's something remarkable about him.

456
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:40,534
I feel for the kid.

457
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:41,451
You know I do.

458
00:36:41,618 --> 00:36:43,704
But we have enough going on with our own kids.

459
00:36:44,037 --> 00:36:45,622
Our own family.

460
00:36:45,497 --> 00:36:48,834
It's just until we figure out who he is and where he belongs.

461
00:36:49,585 --> 00:36:50,794
But we may never know.

462
00:36:51,503 --> 00:36:53,005
I know it's asking a lot.

463
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:53,922
Yeah.

464
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:56,133
Too much.

465
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:06,018
Check with Lou Daniels.
Maybe Social Services has something good for him.

466
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:11,940
[Lou] I can't seem to find his file.

467
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:14,568
I've got nothing for him, Nicole.

468
00:37:14,693 --> 00:37:15,402
I'm sorry.

469
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,113
Thank you, Lou.

470
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:43,972
Come on, now.

471
00:37:43,847 --> 00:37:45,432
Where are you?

472
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:56,109
Don't touch that.

473
00:37:56,819 --> 00:37:58,153
Those are for killing rats.

474
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:04,618
Rats...are your enemy.

475
00:38:04,952 --> 00:38:07,871
No, but when they start paying rent, they can put down people traps.

476
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,085
No, Kyle. We don't want them in the house.

477
00:38:14,336 --> 00:38:17,339
So, you...kill them?

478
00:38:19,633 --> 00:38:20,801
Yeah.

479
00:38:22,261 --> 00:38:23,387
I guess.

480
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:30,602
Ha! There it is!

481
00:38:32,312 --> 00:38:33,814
Oh, man.

482
00:38:35,816 --> 00:38:37,943
Aw! Damn it!

483
00:38:47,411 --> 00:38:50,581
Whereas verbal communication was so random and contradictory,

484
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:56,044
this language was a logical math-based shorthand that made perfect...

485
00:38:55,836 --> 00:38:56,795
Oh, come on!

486
00:39:17,733 --> 00:39:18,859
Wow, that's it!

487
00:39:19,735 --> 00:39:20,903
[laughs] That's the one!

488
00:39:22,738 --> 00:39:23,280
How did you--

489
00:39:53,018 --> 00:39:53,936
You find this?

490
00:39:55,437 --> 00:39:56,605
Why'd you do that?

491
00:39:57,105 --> 00:39:58,899
You said you missed her.

492
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:03,403
Take a shot.

493
00:40:06,949 --> 00:40:08,200
Shoot some hoops.

494
00:40:10,202 --> 00:40:11,578
All right, let me show you.

495
00:40:22,381 --> 00:40:23,215
Now you.

496
00:40:29,263 --> 00:40:30,180
Nice!

497
00:40:34,852 --> 00:40:35,644
Nice.

498
00:40:44,027 --> 00:40:46,071
Okay, Kyle's gonna be down in a sec.

499
00:40:46,655 --> 00:40:49,992
I have a favor to ask each of you, and before you all jump down my throat,

500
00:40:49,950 --> 00:40:51,660
I'd like you to think about it.

501
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:59,251
I was thinking, or I was hoping that you wouldn't mind
if Kyle stayed with us a while longer.
