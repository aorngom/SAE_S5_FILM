1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,100
Did you find 
something out about Kyle?

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,000
It looks like it.
I think Kyle may be connected to a murder.

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
Some hikers found it 
near Victor Falls.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The other night, we found Kyle sitting
right next to the spot.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,000
You yourself said that trauma
may have caused his amnesia.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,400
Well, yes it's possible
that he witnesd the attack.

7
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,000
Has he started
to remember anything?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
We both know you like him
more than you let on.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,700
That doesn't mean that
I expect this big commitment.

10
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,900
Just the truth.

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,400
I bet your family's
searching for you right now.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,200
You didn't just
fall from the sky.

13
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,000
This symbol was on some sort
of security key card we found near the remains.

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,700
Does this mean anything to you?

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,300
No.

16
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,900
Linda sync FRM
by www.1000fr.com 

17
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,500
It was my first dream.

18
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,400
At least the first
I could remember.

19
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,400
My subconscious mind
was weaving a tale of love and loss,

20
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,700
even though my memories
 contained no such stories.

21
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,000
I wondered what it meant.

22
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,900
Was it something I had
 already experienced...

23
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,800
 or simply a vision
 of things to come?

24
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,300
 I wished to go back
 to that moment with Amanda.

25
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,400
 I wanted to see
 how it would end.

26
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,000
You sure you didn't draw this
after you saw the key card?

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,700
No, I noticed these markings
on his drawings well before.

28
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,400
Kyle, why did you
draw this in pieces?

29
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,500
That's how I saw it.

30
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,500
It's possible that fractured
pieces of his past are starting to enter

31
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,600
his consciousness.

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,300
I've seen it before
in patients who have trauma-based amnesia.

33
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,000
 Everyone was concerned about the images
 coming from my head.

34
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,000
 I couldn't explain them any more
 than I could explain my dream about Amanda.

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,800
 My mind was doing things the rest of me
 didn't understand.

36
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,100
Where you goin', Lori?

37
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,400
Uh, yeah, where you goin', Lori?

38
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,300
The pool?

39
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,000
You know,last time I checked,

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,700
looking after Kyle actually
meant looking after Kyle.

41
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,100
But he's busy.

42
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,000
Actually, we're
done here...for now.

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,500
Kyle, do you want to go to the pool?

44
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm the only girl in America
who has to baby-sit a fully grown teenager.

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,200
Take your brother, too,

46
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,700
'cause we have to go
to the high school to register Kyle.

47
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,000
Uhh...choice?

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,200
What if I don't want
to go to the pool?

49
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,500
Uh, maybe you don't want
to spend the rest of the day with your summer

50
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,700
reading list, either.

51
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,100
I'll go get my stuff.

52
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,600
Fabulous.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,400
10 years of service
to the company, Tom.

54
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,300
Sorry to see you go.

55
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,100
Time to move on.

56
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
Is this your
forwarding address?

57
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,500
Yeah.

58
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,800
Good.

59
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,800
The company likes
to keep in touch,

60
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,200
especially now with Kern
still MIA.

61
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,400
Well, I'm sure
you'll track him down.

62
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Goes without saying.

63
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,400
A friendly reminder:

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,600
you know how aggressively 

65
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,000
we enforce these confidentiality
agreements?

66
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,000
Yeah.

67
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,600
One more thing.

68
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Your security card.

69
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,400
Of course.

70
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Both of you stay at least
20 feet from me at all times--

71
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,900
close enough I can see
you're in trouble,

72
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,200
far enough away
I can choose to ignore it.

73
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,400
Lori! Come on!

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,700
Over here.

75
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,000
And don't drown.

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
I'll tell you, brother,

77
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,500
give a woman
an ounce of power,

78
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,600
and she'll run
right over you.

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,200
Why is Amanda
sitting up there?

80
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,700
She's a lifeguard.

81
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,700
She guards life?

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,600
Sorta.

83
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,000
She'll jump in to save you
if you can't swim.

84
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,500
He's, like seriously manorexic.

85
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,100
Eat a sandwich!

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:27,700
Yo, Trager.

87
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,900
What's up?

88
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,000
Are you still mad
at him for lying,

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,100
or are you back to the
playing hard to get game?

90
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
Not a game. I'm over it.

91
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,100
Really.

92
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,000
So you're not
secretly yearning he'll call you over?

93
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,300
Nope.

94
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,000
And you're not
quietly wishing he'd sit here with you?

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,500
Not in the least.

96
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,000
And somewhere deepin your subconscious,

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,700
you have no desire to sleep with him
at Preston's party Friday,

98
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
even though we both swore

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,400
we wouldn't go back to school
with our virginities intact?

100
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 My virginity.

101
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,300
Yours hasn't been an issue
for quite some time.

102
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,000
Whatever.

103
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,400
Are you serious?

104
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:17,800
You're really over him.

105
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
I'm done with the whole
friends with benefits thing.

106
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,900
It's not fun anymore.

107
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,600
We're not really friends,

108
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,900
which means we're just benefits,

109
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,000
and if I'm gonna be giving
benefits to anyone,

110
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,800
it should mean something.

111
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,400
Look who's all protective
of her first time.

112
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,800
You've wanted to sleep
with Declan for, like, ever.

113
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,300
I still do, but 

114
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not giving it up to some guy

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,300
whose idea of fun is crawling
into my bedroom drk at 3:00 in the morning.

116
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,600
Well, we'll just have to find you another
devirginizing opportunity...

117
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,900
like yummity goodness
over there.

118
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:51,900
Ew.

119
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,200
Hillary.

120
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
Fine, I'll take him.

121
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,700
You are so not allowed
to corrupt Kyle.

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Why not?

123
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,400
Because it's, like...wrong.

124
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,600
When do we swim?

125
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,900
We don't come here to swim.

126
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,700
We come here
to scope babes.

127
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,900
Babes?

128
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,900
You know. The ladies.

129
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,100
Hot mamas.

130
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,600
Girls with C-cup

131
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,300
Like her.

132
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,200
Good Lord of the Rings.

133
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Is she a friend of yours?

134
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,100
Dude, a chick like that

135
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,100
doesn't know I exist.

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,400
So you won't go talk to her?

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,900
Talk to her? Are you nuts?

138
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,900
So we come to the pool,

139
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,800
but don't swim.

140
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,900
And we scope babes,

141
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,800
but we don't talk to 'em?

142
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,400
It's a cruel world.

143
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,900
I just live in it.

144
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,600
Did she just--

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:53,800
Don't move.

146
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,800
Lori, my favorite
sister of all time.

147
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,300
No.Come on. Go in the bathroom--
No.

148
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,000
Seriously.

149
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,700
Go in the girls' locker room.

150
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,600
Get the name and number
of the girl in the pink bikini

151
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,300
with the polka dots
on her what-nots.

152
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,900
Her what-nots?

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,400
Forget it.

154
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Look, you're gonna
go in there right now,

155
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
or I'm gonna yell
"Lori Trager stuffs her bra"

156
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
at the top of my lungs.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You are the devil.

158
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,000
Fine, you manipulative
little freak.

159
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,700
He has no records,

160
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,000
no history of schooling?

161
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,500
As I explained,

162
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,300
Kyle's situation is unique.

163
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,100
Certainly is.

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,300
But he's exceptionally bright.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You're requesting
a one-on-one tutor.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,200
That's, um--well, that's
an expensive arrangement.

167
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,800
Legally, you're
obligated to provide it.

168
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,900
£¿

169
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:18,300
?

170
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,400
Are you sure he wouldn't
be better suited for a special-ed program?

171
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
He's not disabled.

172
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm sure. But to be fair,

173
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
high school can be
a very difficult experience 

174
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,500
even for the most well-adjusted students.

175
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,800
If this boy is special,

176
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,700
it may not be the easiest
of transitions for him.

177
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,900
I assume you'll
pass our request up the administrative ladder.

178
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,900
Of course.

179
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,700
Good.

180
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,900
Did you find her?

181
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,000
There is one girl in there.

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,900
Gorgeous, great body.

183
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,600
She's in the shower right now.

184
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,800
Naked.

185
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,500
That's her.

186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,600
That's impossible.

187
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,000
Josh, she's a 10.

188
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,700
There is no way a girl
that hot would come within a mile of you.

189
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Get back in there
and find out her name.

190
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,100
It's not her.

191
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,700
Quit messin' around, Lori.

192
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,000
Quit buggin' me, Josh.

193
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,900
Lori Trager stuffs her bra!

194
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,500
Josh Trager
has wet dreams!

195
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,500
You are so dead.

196
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,300
You guys...where's Kyle?

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,200
 It felt just like my dream.

198
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,100
 And just like Josh said,

199
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,700
 she came to help me.

200
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,100
Is he okay?

201
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,500
How long was he under?

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,300
 My whole body tensed and tingled.

203
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,200
 I suddenly felt a strange sort of pressure.

204
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,900
 Good pressure.

205
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
[laughs] No way!

206
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:54,900
Oh.

207
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,200
Oh!

208
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,300
Kyle, cover up.

209
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,000
Guy had a lot of nerve
implying Kyle didn't belong there.

210
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,700
Hooper's not an educator,
he's a bureaucrat,worried about the bottom line.

211
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,000
He was totally inappropriate.

212
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,400
Well, he's not subtle,that's for sure,
but he has a point.

213
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Hey, honey.

214
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,300
Houston, we have a problem.

215
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,000
What's up?

216
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,800
Funny you should ask.

217
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,200
Rough day?

218
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,700
You want to talk
about what happened...

219
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,400
at the pool?

220
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,600
You mean...

221
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,400
Yeah.

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Everybody laughed at me.

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,200
And you don't know why?

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,800
No.

225
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,100
You never had
an erection before?

226
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,100
Not that I can remember.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,300
Okay, then.

228
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,000
Well, first of all,
you have to understand

229
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,600
that what happened to you
was completely normal.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,200
You just don't typically
want it to happen in public.

231
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,700
Then it's not normal.

232
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,300
No, it is.

233
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,500
It's you body's way of...

234
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,400
telling you how you feel.

235
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,700
In fact...it's a very 
honest physical response.

236
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,300
Then why should it be hidden?

237
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,700
Well...

238
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,500
Uh...

239
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,000
Poor Daddy  ??

240
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I ??

241
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,800
Your're good at it ??

242
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You think?

243
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,800
I feel ??

244
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,100
I'm  ??

245
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Trust me¡£There're nothing for £¿£¿

246
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,900
Hi.

247
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,900
Hello.

248
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,500
Is Lori around?

249
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,400
Declan.

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,100
Hi.

251
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,700
Thanks, Mom.

252
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,700
You're welcome.

253
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,400
Come in.

254
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,500
So...you're, um...

255
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,700
at my house...

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,600
Yeah.

257
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,800
In daylight...

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,300
through the front door.

259
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,600
Who'da thunk?

260
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,500
Why?

261
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,600
I didn't see you
leave the pool.

262
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,600
Yeah, I had to bail.

263
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,700
Anyway, Hillary said
you'd be home.

264
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,700
We still haven't covered
the "why" part yet.

265
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,200
I thought you might
want to go to Preston's party on Friday.

266
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,800
Of course. Everyone's going.

267
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
No. I meant, um...with me.

268
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,600
Oh.

269
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,600
All this back and forth,

270
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,300
Trager, I'm tired of it.

271
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,900
And I'm sorry for whatever
I did to piss you off.

272
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,100
I think it's time
we went out together--

273
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,100
really went out.

274
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,100
But if you're not into it--

275
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,900
No, I'm into it.

276
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,500
Well, good.

277
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,200
So we'll go?

278
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yeah.

279
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Cool.

280
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,600
Oh, do you want me to, like,

281
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,700
pick you up, or somethin'?

282
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,900
I can meet you there.

283
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,100
Sounds like a plan.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
All right.

285
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,200
Later, Trager.

286
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,300
Later.

287
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,400
Okay, look, I've been on
the other side of that talk.

288
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
It ain't pretty.

289
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
He said when it happens again
in front of people,

290
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,600
I should think of
something I don't like.

291
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,400
Totally.

292
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,100
I usually go wh zits
and old people.

293
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,000
You?

294
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,100
Grapefruit.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,700
Hmm.

296
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,400
You should know there
are other ways to handle the little problem.

297
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,100
Ta-da.

298
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,000
Charlotte?

299
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,200
No, Charlotte's mine, dude.

300
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,900
You are not ready
for Charlotte.

301
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,100
Meet Ginger.

302
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,700
What do I do with it?

303
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
You look at it.

304
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:32,900
Like at the pool.

305
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,800
Scope babes.

306
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,700
Except when you're here alone,

307
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,900
you can lock your door...

308
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,000
and do...other things.

309
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Is Kyle around?

310
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,100
I feel horrible about
what happened today.

311
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,500
Straight back,
other side of the kitchen.

312
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,900
Thanks.

313
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,600
Hi.

314
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
I have to go.

315
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,000
How would you like
to get out of watching Kyle

316
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,400
for a couple hours every day?

317
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,300
I'm listening.

318
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:07,300
Well, I can make it happen
in exchange for Miss Pink Bikini's digits.

319
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,000
Are we still on that?

320
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,600
Are you interested or not?

321
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,800
Of course.

322
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Hi, Mom.

323
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,400
What do you want?

324
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
So Lori and I were thinking,

325
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,800
maybe we shouldn't bring
Kyle to the pool today.

326
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,300
I mean, not after yesterday.

327
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,700
Because of the..."incident"?

328
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,400
No, I was more worried
about the whole drowning thing.

329
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,600
What drowning thing?

330
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
Kyle doesn't know
how to swim.

331
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,400
That's no reason he should
miss out on going to the pool.

332
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,500
We should get him lessons.

333
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:36,500
That's a great idea.

334
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,300
They offer lessons down there.

335
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,100
Couple hours every day.

336
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,700
He'll be swimmin' in no time.

337
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,100
Amanda, your next
leon's here.

338
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,400
Thanks.

339
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,300
She hates me.

340
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Just don't hump her leg,

341
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
and you'll be fine.

342
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,600
Hi. You're Ashley, right?

343
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,800
Yeah. Hi.

344
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,200
Hi. Can I talk to you
for a second?

345
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,800
Mission accomplished.

346
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,500
Ditched responsibility,

347
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,400
and paid off a debt,

348
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,300
all at once.

349
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,100
You know, I'd happily
give Kyle swimming lessons.

350
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,200
I'd show him
the breast stroke.

351
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,000
You're seriously
grossing me out.

352
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,700
Okay, prudey.

353
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
Please, I am so not a prude.

354
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,600
Ye, just a virgin.

355
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,900
By a very minor technicality.

356
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:42,200
Besides, I decided you're
right about the sex thing.

357
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,300
You're kidding.

358
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,400
Well, it's not like
I'm waiting for true love,

359
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
and the only reason
I've held out this long 

360
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,200
is he hadn't done anything
to deserve it.

361
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,100
But if he's
finally stepping up,

362
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,200
there's no reason
why I shouldn't.

363
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,600
So...cup your hand
and pull the water along with you.

364
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,700
You have to float.

365
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Float.

366
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,300
Yeah. You know.

367
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
You don't know.

368
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,600
Uh, here.

369
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
See?

370
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,900
Let the water hold you up.

371
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Grapefruit.

372
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,200
Her name is Ashley Redmond.

373
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,700
She's your age.

374
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Catholic School.

375
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,200
You better call now and get
the humiliation over with.

376
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,100
Oh, sweet. Thanks.

377
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,400
Whatever.

378
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,800
Hello?

379
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,100
Damn.

380
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
 Buoyancy.

381
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,700
 Strokes.

382
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
 Breathing.

383
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,900
 It all made sense in theory.

384
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
 Now it was time
 to put it into practice.

385
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,500
Where'd he go?

386
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,400
You must be a great teacher.

387
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,800
Hey.

388
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,300
Are you sure you've never
been swimming before?

389
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,600
Yesterday.

390
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
That wasn't swimming.

391
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
That was drowning.

392
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,500
You don't have
a belly button.

393
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:26,600
No.

394
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,300
Why not?

395
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,900
I don't know.

396
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,300
And you still don't remember anything
about your life before?

397
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,800
No.

398
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,700
But you can jump off tall buildings
and swim likean Olympic champion.

399
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,000
Josh tnks I'm an alien.

400
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,100
Or Superman.

401
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,800
You're not angry anymore.

402
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,500
I never was.

403
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:50,700
I just...thought your drawings
were kind of weird.

404
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Why?

405
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,900
There were a lot of me.

406
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,300
I--I draw everything exactly
how I see it in my head.

407
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
But you're special.

408
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,900
I can't seem to get you right.

409
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,800
How come?

410
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,200
Seems like there's
something missing.

411
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,200
My mom's gonna be out
tomorrow afternoon.

412
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,600
Come by my house.

413
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,700
I wanna show you something.

414
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,000
Hey. I spoke to
Detective Breen again.

415
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,300
Did he have anything
new about the logo?

416
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:31,600
Nothing. The logo doesn't
match corporation on record.

417
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,100
And they haven't
been able to decrypt

418
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,500
the computerized strip
on the key card.

419
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,000
Wow, that muste some
sophisticated security system,whatever it's for.

420
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,600
Oh, this worries me, Stephen.

421
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,900
We've no idea what Kyle
might have witnessed.

422
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Well, you're doin' what you can
to help him remember.

423
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,500
Well, maybe now's not the best time
to send him to school.

424
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,200
Oh, please tell me you're not letting 
that vice principal get to you.

425
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,500
Well, he's right.

426
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,900
I want to protect Kyle,

427
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:00,500
not thrust him into another
traumatizing experience.

428
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:03,400
Don't you thinkhe should try to live
like a normal teenage boy?

429
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,700
I'd feel better
if I believed he was normal.

430
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,900
Tom.

431
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,100
What are you doing here?

432
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,200
Something's been
botherin' me.

433
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,500
I thought we should
have a little chat.

434
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
Your key card--

435
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,900
I ran it through the system
to deactivate it,

436
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,100
but the clearance code
didn't match your assignment.

437
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,200
Strae.

438
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,100
That's what I said.

439
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,800
Thought maybe
it was a computer error.

440
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:54,200
And then, I discovered that Kern
was cleared to that level.

441
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,300
Interesting coincidence,

442
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,600
him being missing and all.

443
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,600
I thought it might be a piece of information
you might find worth something.

444
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,100
Something you might 
want me to keep quiet.

445
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,000
Get out.

446
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,200
Think about it.

447
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,600
I have a feeling you don't want the company to know
what you've been up to.

448
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,400
This is my dad's.

449
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
He was an artist too.

450
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,000
Not for, like,a living, but...

451
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,500
it was his thing.

452
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,900
Was?

453
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,100
He died last year.

454
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,700
He's what's missing.

455
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,400
Anyways...take a look.

456
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,800
He saw this in his head?

457
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,400
Kind of.

458
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,000
Art is about drawing
what you feel,

459
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,600
not just what you see.

460
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,500
How do you draw a feeling?

461
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,400
It's like piano.

462
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,300
Right now, I'm just
playg notes.

463
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,200
But art is about putting your
whole self into something...

464
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,600
everything you feel.

465
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,800
How do you feel?

466
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
Just listen.

467
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 I didn't know that I could make a picture
 of how I felt inside,

468
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,200
 but I really wanted to try.

469
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,300
Hello?

470
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,200
Josh Trager?

471
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,600
Uh...hi?

472
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I saw the caller ID.

473
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,000
Your sister said
I would hear from you.

474
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,000
She did?

475
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,400
I'm totally psyched.

476
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:16,300
You are?

477
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,200
Are you going to Jeff Preston's
party tonight?

478
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,000
I don't know him,

479
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,400
but everyone goes, right?

480
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,300
Right.

481
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,100
Awesome. So see you there.

482
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,300
Wardrobe crisis?

483
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,200
The usual.

484
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,200
I love that red shirt
you have.

485
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,700
I think I'm gonna go
with the blue.

486
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,100
Josh wants to go to the party.

487
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,700
I know you have a date.

488
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Date? Mom, so '80s.

489
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,900
Okay, whatever you want
to call it.

490
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,000
Anyway,I was gonna say no,

491
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,800
and then he went into this sales pitch
about how it's a rite of passage into high school.

492
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,300
Well, he's sort of rht.

493
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,700
But don't worry.

494
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,800
It's chaperoned.

495
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,000
And I'll look out for him.

496
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
Unless he embarrasses me,
in which case I will kill him.

497
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,200
Thank you, Lori.

498
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,100
So, this Declan.

499
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:20,500
Is he a good guy?

500
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,200
Mmm, most of the time.

501
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,900
Kyle...

502
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,400
you're comin' to the party.

503
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,400
I don't like parties.

504
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,800
You have to come.

505
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,900
Everyone goes.

506
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,500
Even Amanda?

507
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,500
Guaranteed.

508
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,700
Good. I have
something for her.

509
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,100
Great. Bring it.

510
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:09,600
Get dressed.

511
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,900
Bye, guys.

512
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,100
Bye, guys.

513
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Bye, guys.

514
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,900
Kyle, you're not going?

515
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Lori, see you at midnight.

516
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,400
Kyle and Josh, 10:00 or you
won't live to see 10:01.

517
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:33,500
But--

518
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,600
Go ahead.
Have a good time.

519
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,400
Let's get this over with.

520
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,100
I thought you'd come around.

521
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,200
I underestimated you, Tom.

522
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,800
I never thought the quiet guy
from work would be cap--

523
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,900
member the rules--

524
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,700
no drinking, no puking,outta here by 9:45.

525
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,300
I'll be watching.And I will narc.

526
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,400
 I don't see Ashley.

527
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Or Amanda.

528
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,600
I should've knownit was too good to be true.

529
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,800
Oh, there sh

530
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,900
Hi, Josh.

531
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
[squeaky voice]Ashley...

532
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,200
[clears throat]Hey.

533
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,300
I'm so glad you made it.I don't know anyone here.

534
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,700
Come on.

535
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
I like your shirt.

536
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,200
Thanks.

537
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,000
I was going fornaughty and nice.

538
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,400
[chuckles]It's working.

539
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:41,600
Yo, Preston.

540
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,500
Oh, hey. What's up, guys?

541
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,100
Great party.

542
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,800
Yeah.

543
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:46,600
It'd be better if my parentsweren't lurkin'.

544
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,700
But I hid a bunch of beeraround the property,

545
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,800
so help yourselves.

546
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,300
Thanks, man.You know it.

547
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:52,500
Thirsty?

548
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,800
Always.

549
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:03,800
Oh, my God.That's funny.

550
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,600
Oh, sweet.

551
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,200
I didn't bring a suit.

552
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,800
Damn. Me, neither.

553
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,700
What doin'?

554
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,700
I don't wanna get my clothes wet.

555
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:22,500
What are you doing?

556
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,900
Checking forthe hidden cameras.

557
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
You're funny.

558
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,300
It's my thing.

559
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,100
Right. Sorry.

560
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,300
Why are you sorry?

561
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,700
[giggling]You're hot.

562
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:17,600
It's warm outside.

563
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,000
No, I mean hot hot...

564
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,300
like smokin'.[gig]

565
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,800
Sister Mary Lourdes woulddefinitely not approve.

566
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,200
What she doesn't knowwon't hurt her.

567
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,500
This is totally fun.

568
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,200
When I saw you at the poolthe other day,

569
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,400
I was hoping you'd come talk to me.

570
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,100
You were?

571
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
I thought you were cute.

572
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,600
You did?

573
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:47,400
There aren't anyother boys at my school
to compare you to...but yeah.

574
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,200
What the hell is going on?

575
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,000
Mr. and Mrs. Preston?

576
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,100
Get out of there right now.

577
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,900
[exhales sharply]Honey, come on.

578
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,700
Young man?

579
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,300
I can't.

580
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,700
Zits. Old people.

581
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,700
Zits. Old people.

582
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:15,800
I'm gonna count to 3.

583
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,200
1...

584
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,900
2...

585
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:20,600
Grapefruit!

586
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:38,600
So,

587
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,700
Yeah.

588
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,400
Um, was that your, uh--

589
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:47,400
Yeah. Yours?

590
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,900
No.

591
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,600
I mean, I haven't done it a ton,

592
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,100
but it--it wasn't my first.

593
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,300
It gets better.

594
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,900
Well, I'd better go back to the party.

595
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,100
 Everyone thinks I'm a slut just because
of the eighth gradefield trip to Tacoma.

596
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,400
But I just want a sweet guyto cuddle with.

597
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,100
Is that so wrong?

598
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,900
You feel nice.

599
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,200
 Hillary made my body feel good.

600
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,800
 But just like the girls in Joss maganes,

601
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,500
 something didn't feel right.

602
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,300
 There was a piece missing.

603
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,000
Hillary, get off of him.

604
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:39,900
Go away.

605
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,600
God, you slut.Ow!

606
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,300
I told you to leave him alone.

607
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,000
What are you so worried I'll do?

608
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,100
Gee, I wonder.

609
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:53,000
Do you really think I'm such a super is
You've held out on one thing,

610
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,400
and you act likethe freakin' purity police.

611
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,500
That's not what I'm--

612
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:56,400
I'm tired of it.

613
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Poor Declan.

614
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,800
I never should havetold him to ask you out.

615
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,300
What?

616
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:07,300
I told him you weren't gonna put out anymore
unless he stepped up.

617
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,800
But that's--She didn't say it like that.

618
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
That--that's not what--

619
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,000
Don't talk to me.

620
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,100
You two totally did it,didn't you?

621
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:23,200
Who knew after all this time you'd be so easy?

622
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,900
Declan, man, dude, you gotta come check this out.

623
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,100
It's hilarious.Come here.

624
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,300
Eh, eh, outta the way.

625
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,800
Still in the non-speaking part of the evening?

626
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,000
How could you let him go to that party?

627
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,000
Well, we let Josh go,and he's younger.

628
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,700
I'm not worried about Josh being able to hand himself.

629
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,900
And I'm not worried about Kyle.

630
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:12,700
But he is--

631
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:18,100
Listen, Nicole, you need to ease up on the reins
just a little bit.

632
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,000
Kyle needs to get out there and experience life.

633
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,700
He needs to have it knock him around a little bit.

634
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,200
We took him in so we could protect him.

635
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,900
Not by keeping him in a bubble.

636
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,300
All right, look.

637
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,000
I realize that he's your patient.

638
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:34,500
Yes.

639
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,000
But it's hard for me to stay clinical about him.

640
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,300
Well, of course it is.

641
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,100
So let's handle him like we handle Josh and Lori.

642
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,600
The reason they're well-adjusted
is because we treat them with respect.

643
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,700
We let 'em go out there and make their mistakes,

644
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,300
and they know we're herewhen they need us.

645
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,300
We need to give Kyle the same chance.

646
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,700
I hope you're right.

647
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,600
It had to happen sometime.

648
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,000
Everyone ??

649
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
None ??

650
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,400
What're you doning ?

651
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:21,900
Hidding??

652
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:28,600
From what  ??

653
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,100
Everyting ??

654
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,000
Everybody ?? 

655
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,400
So you finally tapped that, huh?

656
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,000
No, man.

657
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,200
She's not like that.

658
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,200
 Seeing Amanda, I realized something.

659
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,000
 I had been struggling to understand

660
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
 what my mind and body were trying to tell me.

661
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,400
 And right then, I knew what it was.

662
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,900
 Everything was working together,

663
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,800
 sending a message to my heart.

664
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,900
Kyle.

665
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,000
Amda. There you are.

666
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Hey.

667
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,600
[Man]We were waiting for you.

668
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,200
Oh, Charlie, this
is my neighbor Kyle.

669
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,900
Kyle, this is Charlie,my boyfriend.

670
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,300
Hey. Nice to meet you, man.

671
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,500
 And now my heart was sending a message
 to the rest of my body--

672
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:55,400
So you guys live acrossthe street from each other.

673
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,000
 pain.

674
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,500
[Amanda] Uh, next door.Yeah, he just moved in.

675
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,200
[Charlie]Oh, wow. Cool.

676
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,100
 Life is a puzzle.

677
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,200
 Every piece fits together to create who we are,

678
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,400
 what we do, how we feel.

679
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,900
 Every experience shapes us
 into who we will eventually become.

680
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,800
 I began as a blank slate.

681
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,500
 Maybe my hidden memories tell a different story.

682
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,900
 Maybe I hold the key to a mystery
 even greater than that of my past.

683
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,300
 I've been so eager to remember, 

684
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:05,100
to grow up
and experience life like Lori and Josh... 

685
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,100
 but in that one moment,
 I wish I could go back to that blank slate...

686
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,400
when life was...easier.

687
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,700
 I think they wished for it, too.

688
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,500
Ready?

689
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,600
Let's go home.

690
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,400
Okay.

691
