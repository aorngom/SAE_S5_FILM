1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:05,668
- Previously on <i>Alias:</i>
- SD-6 has nothing to do with the CIA.

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:09,089
- Dixon, you've been lied to.
- What are you...

3
00:00:09,175 --> 00:00:12,129
SD-6 is part of the Alliance.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,549
You have been working for the enemy
you thought you were fighting.

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,766
We've gotten reports from all team leaders.

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:23,855
We appear to be in control
of all Alliance facilities.

7
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:26,727
Dixon...

8
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,565
Hey, look, this'll be over soon.
I promise.

9
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:37,577
Don't talk to me.

10
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,082
You're so beautiful.

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,124
Dinner's ready.

12
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,749
We do have an oven, you know.
We can reheat.

13
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:15,490
How are we gonna stay awake today?

14
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,532
Who cares?

15
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:21,159
I see it around me

16
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,874
I see it in everything

17
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:30,662
Vaughn?

18
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:36,629
- How come you never call me Michael?
- I do sometimes.

19
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,129
- Vaughn?
- What?

20
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,224
- I'm graduating today.
- What?

21
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:46,561
When the hell did you have time
to take a class this year?

22
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,724
I wasn't even gonna go to the ceremony,

23
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:56,444
but I've been lying here remembering
why I never gave school up,

24
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,910
and why I killed myself
writing papers instead of just...

25
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:03,403
I don't know.

26
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,534
Accepting that I'd be an agent forever.

27
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,877
You're gonna quit the CIA, aren't you?

28
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:20,596
- I'm afraid I can't endorse your resignation.
- Excuse me?

29
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,805
With the Alliance gone,
we got a hell of a mess to clean up.

30
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,932
- You don't need me for that.
- That's opinion.

31
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,099
And what about Arvine Sloane,

32
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:28,595
whom I'd think you would have
a special interest in bringing to justice.

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,810
Sloane is just a cog in a machine
that doesn't exist any more.

34
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,645
He's wanted in 40 countries.

35
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:37,900
I did everything for the CIA I said I would,
and I'm done.

36
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:41,407
Jack, you wanna jump in here?

37
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:50,122
For years, I wanted nothing more
than to see you live a normal life.

38
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,212
However, your value to the CIA
is irrefutable.

39
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,207
So while this is your ultimately choice,

40
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,751
I suggest that,
given the enormity of the last two weeks,

41
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,795
you may not want to make life-altering
decisions without a little more perspective.

42
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:08,016
I've had two years of perspective. I am
through letting Arvin Sloane control my life.

43
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:11,805
And I don't need your approval
to resign. I told you as a courtesy.

44
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,020
Well then, I will pay you the courtesy of
informing you that if you leave this agency,

45
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,480
you forfeit the clearance
to see your mother.

46
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,151
What? Are you blackmailing me?

47
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,530
Civilians aren't authorised
to be in this facility,

48
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,451
let alone have access to a terrorist that we
can't even acknowledge is in our custody.

49
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,789
In or out, kiddo.
Can't have it both ways.

50
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:39,004
Legally, he's right.

51
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,798
Ethically, he's an ass.

52
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:13,539
Congratulations.
Your father told me about your success.

53
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,500
What about your associates at SD-6?
You had friends there, yes?

54
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:23,253
I haven't seen them yet.
They're still being debriefed.

55
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,298
I'm sorry that
I haven't been to see you in a while.

56
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,549
I understand.

57
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:32,261
I'm sure this has been
overwhelming for you.

58
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:40,105
- I graduate today.
- I know.

59
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:48,491
I would think you'd be more relieved
with SD-6 and the Alliance gone.

60
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,453
I'm thinking of leaving the CIA.

61
00:04:55,545 --> 00:05:02,544
Which would mean
giving up my clearance to see you.

62
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:12,261
You're too forgiving, Sydney.
Don't pretend I'm something I'm not.

63
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:18,107
I've never been a real mother to you,
and you don't owe me a second chance.

64
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,775
If you make this decision about me,
you're a fool.

65
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,355
In fact, if you decide to stay,

66
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,988
I won't agree to see you any more.

67
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,538
Take care of yourself.

68
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,902
- Aaron. Aaron, don't run.
- I just wanna go back to the jellyfish.

69
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:09,402
Always make sure we can see you, OK?
And hold onto your jacket. Aaron.

70
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:20,163
- OK. So, you're gonna stay here, right?
- Yes.

71
00:06:20,255 --> 00:06:23,042
- You're gonna stay here? OK?
- Yeah. Yes.

72
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,584
I'll be right over there
with your daddy, OK?

73
00:06:28,972 --> 00:06:31,463
Where are you?

74
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:33,431
Here. I'm here.

75
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:37,979
Neil, it's Aaron's birthday
and your head's still at the blackboard.

76
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:40,021
Honey.

77
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:46,730
I... I just... I need two more months.
That's it. I-I-I am this close.

78
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,365
I can't stand any more promises
you don't keep.

79
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,451
- I don't know how else to do this.
- Maybe you don't. There are other fields...

80
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:56,910
Once the polytechnic goes public
with the design, then I'll slow down.

81
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,285
I mean, I'll stop. I promise.

82
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:05,425
Think about your father.

83
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:10,717
Aaron's growing up,
and you're missing it.

84
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:19,896
Where is he?

85
00:07:26,321 --> 00:07:27,815
- Aaron?
- Aaron?

86
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,898
Aaron? Aaron?

87
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,485
Excuse me. Did you see a little boy?

88
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,779
He's five years old, he's got
a striped shirt on. He's got brown hair.

89
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:36,579
- His name's Aaron.
- No, sorry.

90
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,120
- Aaron?
- I'll check the gift shop.

91
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,201
Aaron?

92
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,956
Mr Caplan?

93
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:50,591
I believe I can help you locate your son.

94
00:07:52,764 --> 00:07:55,337
And your wife.

95
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:14,735
It was cold in the night
Of an early-morning light

96
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:18,161
OK, seriously?
Oh, my God.

97
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,490
Francie, what? Earrings? Necklace?
What do I need?

98
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,161
Let's see.

99
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:28,256
You look beautiful.

100
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,923
I'm so proud of you.

101
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,921
Thank you.

102
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,340
What's a four-letter word
for "ice-cream thickener"?

103
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,769
- Hello?
- Agar. A-g-a-r.

104
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:46,189
- How'd you know that?
- Phone's for you.

105
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:50,320
- Hello?
- Congratulations, Sydney.

106
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:54,698
You have so many things
to celebrate today.

107
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:59,077
I, myself, am still coping with the pain
and disappointment of learning that

108
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:02,497
you and Jack were double agents.

109
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:04,707
The two people
I trusted most in the world.

110
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:08,543
How many <i>s's</i> are in "Massachusetts"?
Sorry.

111
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:16,388
Our first honest conversation, Sydney,
and you have nothing to say?

112
00:09:16,473 --> 00:09:22,178
Listen to me, you son of a bitch. You have
been a plague on my life. You repulse me.

113
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:24,559
Every time I sat across from you
listening to your lies,

114
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:29,938
all I could do was fantasise
about slashing your throat.

115
00:09:30,028 --> 00:09:35,734
Well, I can't pretend to be surprised
that you feel that way.

116
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:40,119
My only hope is that
you can learn to forgive me.

117
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,447
As hurt as I am,
I know I can forgive you.

118
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,620
After all, Sydney, I helped you.

119
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,628
What are you talking about?

120
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,339
You don't really think it was a coincidence

121
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,627
that I happened to be away
these last two weeks, do you?

122
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:59,097
The intel you that acquired that allowed
the CIA to take down the Alliance -

123
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:00,807
I provided that.

124
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:06,678
My involvement with the Alliance
is merely a means to an end.

125
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,730
Why are you telling me this?

126
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:14,059
Because knowing that I'm alive is gonna
tempt you to come after me. Don't.

127
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:17,615
We've helped set each other free,
Sydney.

128
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,989
And as much as I wish you well,

129
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:23,990
I will end your life if you get in my way.

130
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:31,454
He called me at home to warn me.

131
00:10:31,548 --> 00:10:34,881
No matter where he is,
I can be gotten to.

132
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:40,013
Unfortunately you're not the only one.

133
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:43,763
Neil Caplan. He's a mathematician
working out of Caltech.

134
00:10:43,852 --> 00:10:46,521
The Bureau just confirmed that
he and his family were kidnapped

135
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:48,597
from the Long Beach aquarium yesterday.

136
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,141
Parking lot surveillance cameras
recorded this.

137
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,441
- Sark.
- Doubtful he's acting alone.

138
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:05,119
I assume his partnership with Sloane
is alive and well.

139
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,784
What do they want with a mathematician?

140
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,710
He specialises in a branch of mathematics
called knot theory.

141
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,454
"Knot" as in "tie a knot"?

142
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:15,674
Simply put, it's the study of geometric
objects and how they fit together.

143
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,632
All Alliance facilities have been raided,

144
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,292
yet we haven't found
a single Rambaldi artefact.

145
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,764
If Sloane was expecting our raid,

146
00:11:21,848 --> 00:11:24,054
he could have had everything removed
to a secure location.

147
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:29,018
He must be using Caplan
to help him assemble a Rambaldi device.

148
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,190
So what happens when Sloane
puts the pieces together?

149
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,600
Whether or not you believe
Rambaldi was a prophet,

150
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:37,364
he did anticipate technological advances,

151
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:40,282
many of which seem
most applicable to warfare.

152
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:43,818
It's likely Sloane is building a weapon.

153
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:53,249
He planned for this.
He wanted the Alliance gone.

154
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,086
And this family
that he's taken hostage -

155
00:11:57,175 --> 00:12:01,837
these aren't the only people
whose lives he'll destroy.

156
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,466
This is never gonna stop.

157
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:14,307
Your resignation form.
Sign it and you're out.

158
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,039
Your glasses.

159
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,878
Mr Caplan,
my name is Arvin Sloane.

160
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,172
- Where's my family?
- They're alive.

161
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:30,641
And if you cooperate
you'll be reunited soon enough.

162
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,803
Where am I?

163
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:38,772
Years ago, I was with
the Army Corps of Engineers.

164
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:42,316
They wanted me to study this.

165
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:48,489
That manuscript is 500 years old.

166
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:54,458
Those sketches were drawn
by a man named Milo Rambaldi.

167
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:56,915
You will that see Rambaldi prophesied

168
00:13:57,003 --> 00:14:00,088
scientific principles
centuries ahead of his time.

169
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:04,253
Prototypes of his designs
have turned up all over the world.

170
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,925
For the past 30 years
I've been collecting them.

171
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:13,428
I don't understand why you want me.
I'm nobody.

172
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:17,387
You're gonna help me put them together.
Because you see, Mr Caplan,

173
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:22,108
I know that you feel like
you're only a hostage right now.

174
00:14:22,195 --> 00:14:25,113
But I assume you became
a scientist to discover

175
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,654
what secrets the universe has to offer.

176
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:35,457
Believe me, when we're done here, you'll
be thanking me for giving you the answers.

177
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:38,661
So why don't you go ahead
and take a look?

178
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:21,252
I wanted to be the one to come in and tell
you officially that you've been cleared.

179
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,375
The CIA has concluded that
you had no knowledge

180
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,874
of what was really going on at SD-6.

181
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:31,172
They wanna offer you a place here.

182
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:40,010
Dixon, you have to know
that you were my anchor.

183
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:47,946
Your friendship was the only thing
that kept me sane.

184
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,983
How long have you known?

185
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:57,578
Two years.

186
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:02,826
I wanted to tell you, so many times.

187
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:05,672
But I was ordered not to.

188
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:09,707
The CIA had no way to verify
what I knew in my heart was true -

189
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:15,758
that you would never consciously work
for a man like Arvin Sloane.

190
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:22,272
We were partners.

191
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,725
You lied to me.

192
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,067
Then chose to tell me the truth
when it was convenient for you.

193
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,865
I never wanna see you again.

194
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,260
OK, I'll need taps into all governments
networks - NSA, DOD, FBI, CIA.

195
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,762
Oh, I'll need a red phone to the president.

196
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,395
- No.
- Just thought I'd ask.

197
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,760
I'll need a Cryogen ATR prototype rig.

198
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:08,194
Don't worry, I'll put my own baffles
on the heat sink so it won't be too...

199
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,899
Wow.

200
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,244
Marshall, I'm Michael Vaughn.
Welcome to the CIA.

201
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:19,736
- Heard that one before.
- Well, this time it's for real.

202
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,788
We have a desk set up for you.

203
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,413
- OK. Oh, Syd, hey.
- Marshall.

204
00:17:27,714 --> 00:17:29,338
- You OK?
- Yeah.

205
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:31,713
Every few minutes
I have to fight the urge to weep openly.

206
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,968
I'm not really sure where that's coming
from yet, but I think that's healthy, right?

207
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,427
Listen, I know you need time to adjust,

208
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,093
but we could really use your help
with something.

209
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:43,264
We're trying to find Sloane, but we can't
access any information from his computer.

210
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,391
Well, he probably erased everything
from his hard drive before he left.

211
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:49,400
And the deletion program I installed last
year exceeded DOD sanitising standards,

212
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,644
cos, you know,
I thought I was working for the government.

213
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:53,861
You know the story,
cos you also thought you were working...

214
00:17:53,948 --> 00:17:56,902
I mean, you actually were working for
the government, and we didn't really know.

215
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,069
But, I mean, that's OK. I...

216
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:01,735
I'll see what I can do.

217
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:10,746
Hey, baby. Got your message.

218
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,960
Sorry your business trip was delayed.

219
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:26,060
- Where are the kids?
- At the park, with Mindy.

220
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:30,560
I'm glad the bank at least gave you
the rest of the day off.

221
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,102
- Diane?
- Mm?

222
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,689
We need to talk.

223
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,498
What is it?
Is it your mother?

224
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,532
No.

225
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,300
I don't work at a bank.

226
00:18:57,846 --> 00:19:00,550
I never have.

227
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:08,014
Well, I was able to recover a few fragments
from the RAM drive on Sloane's database.

228
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:11,273
One of them was the most recent doc
he was working on. It's a digital Rolodex.

229
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:13,933
Now, he checked one address
in particular.

230
00:19:14,029 --> 00:19:18,406
Holden Gemler, Van Nuys.
Guy's a cybernetic specialist.

231
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,158
I'll go.

232
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:09,367
OK. Now, usually red eye
is a photographic effect

233
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,167
caused by light reflecting in the pupil.

234
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:16,543
But in Holden Gemler's case
it was caused by this.

235
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,717
- It's an intra-ocular retinal implant.
- Care to elaborate?

236
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,590
Of course, Mr...
Director. Cos you're the...

237
00:20:22,681 --> 00:20:25,468
Director Kendall, right?
Um, it's one <i>I?</i>

238
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,263
- Two.
- It's two. Of course. Why would it be...

239
00:20:28,353 --> 00:20:31,638
By the way, sir, this place,
so much cooler than SD-6.

240
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:34,685
- How about the point?
- Of course. Sorry.

241
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:37,693
So, basically, this guy Gemler,
he was blind in his left eye,

242
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:41,148
so he used himself as a guinea pig
for wetware experiments.

243
00:20:41,241 --> 00:20:44,407
Interfacing technology with
the human brain. Real cutting edge.

244
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:47,067
Basically, this implant connects
with the optical nerve,

245
00:20:47,163 --> 00:20:49,322
which sends impulses
to the vision centre in his brain.

246
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,622
What did Sloane want
with a wetware expert?

247
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,247
All Alliance members
were injected with a tracking device.

248
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:57,955
Sloane must have hired Gemler
to deactivate his so he could disappear.

249
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:59,045
Right. But there's more.

250
00:20:59,134 --> 00:21:02,004
Now, this little baby records everything
it sees on an internal memory.

251
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,218
Now, the LED light was blinking
because it was full,

252
00:21:04,305 --> 00:21:07,093
so I was able to download
12 hours of footage.

253
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:11,976
Now, there was no audio so I created
a lip-reading program. Just whipped it up.

254
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,266
No extra charge. And, uh...

255
00:21:15,358 --> 00:21:18,443
Take a look at what I found.

256
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:22,193
This is the last thing Gemler saw.

257
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,703
Mr Sloane.

258
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:38,499
This is Sloane. I've chartered a C-123
out of Shipman to transport the artefacts.

259
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,997
I will be in touch.

260
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:45,801
"Shipman" could refer to the airfield in the
Mojave Desert. We've surveilled it before.

261
00:21:45,889 --> 00:21:48,925
It's operated by
a transatlantic smuggling cartel.

262
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:52,516
Ex-military, dishonourably discharged
after the Gulf War.

263
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:56,767
They're well-armed, highly organised
and they do have a C-123 in their fleet.

264
00:21:56,858 --> 00:21:59,183
I can have a tactical team there
in three hours.

265
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,270
Once these guys understand
their legal options,

266
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,320
they'll be inclined to tell us
where Sloane went.

267
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,862
Interrogating the employees
could take days.

268
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:09,284
And Sloane doesn't just let hostages go
when he's done with them.

269
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,651
I'm open to suggestions.

270
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,740
If we could get into the facility undetected

271
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:16,415
and access the flight data recorder
on the plane Sloane chartered,

272
00:22:16,503 --> 00:22:20,085
we could track him directly
to his last destination.

273
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:23,293
Spoken like a true volunteer.

274
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,721
I'm hungry.

275
00:22:40,276 --> 00:22:43,443
- Where's my husband?
- Your husband is a gifted individual,

276
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:46,815
and we need his assistance
for a short while.

277
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:51,736
Should he choose to cooperate,
this will soon be an unpleasant memory.

278
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:58,081
We'd like for you to tell your husband
that you support his cooperation.

279
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:02,333
And that if he doesn't,
your son will be the first to suffer.

280
00:23:02,424 --> 00:23:06,042
Oh, God.

281
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,496
So, Mr Johnson, I need these
shipped to Beijing by tomorrow.

282
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:38,998
You know what I find most interesting,
Mr Ludlow?

283
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:44,376
It's that for an accomplished arms
merchant, I've never heard your name.

284
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:51,090
Now, if you really are an expert,

285
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:54,098
you'll know what kind of gun
is pointed at the back of your head

286
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,675
by the sound of the hammer.

287
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,900
An M1911.

288
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:08,235
But if he were really gonna shoot me, he
would have disengaged the thumb safety.

289
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,239
I got a charter leaving for Asia
in half an hour.

290
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:16,905
If the money and the delivery instructions
are in that briefcase as we discussed,

291
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:21,292
it's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

292
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,141
Good call on the gun.
I would have said Beretta M9.

293
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:47,607
Figured I had a fifty-fifty chance.

294
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:52,073
Found the aft access panel.
Looking for the flight data recorder.

295
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:56,238
Found it.
Attaching the disk imager.

296
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:58,914
Receiving uplink now.

297
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:10,216
Uplink complete.
Get out of there.

298
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:14,012
What are you doing here?
I don't have a work order on this aircraft.

299
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:17,347
Give me your ID.
I'm calling this in.

300
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:20,350
Tower, I need confirmation on...

301
00:25:22,397 --> 00:25:24,639
Vaughn, I've been made.
Meet me at the northwest hangar.

302
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:26,642
Copy that. On my way.

303
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,391
Get in.

304
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:10,861
Go.

305
00:26:53,405 --> 00:26:56,026
Where'd you stay last night?

306
00:26:56,116 --> 00:26:58,571
At my sister's.

307
00:26:59,452 --> 00:27:02,204
The kids are there.

308
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:11,881
The time you were shot,
you told me that you had been mugged.

309
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:20,798
If you had died that day,
I would have buried a stranger.

310
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:26,845
Oh, God. I don't know if a single word
you have ever said to me was true.

311
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,779
My love for you is true.

312
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:39,532
My love for our children is true.

313
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,618
As a husband,

314
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:44,993
as a father,

315
00:27:48,043 --> 00:27:52,669
I couldn't honestly say I was protecting
our family unless I was out there.

316
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,710
Except you were working for the people
that make the world more dangerous.

317
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,801
I thought I was serving our country.

318
00:28:01,723 --> 00:28:06,717
This man, Sloane...

319
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:17,353
I will never lie to you again.

320
00:28:20,575 --> 00:28:23,611
The CIA's offered me a job.

321
00:28:29,834 --> 00:28:33,453
Marcus, I did not choose

322
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:38,671
a life of wondering whether my husband
was coming home every night.

323
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:46,346
You take that job,
you take it alone.

324
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,857
Will you help us?

325
00:29:08,206 --> 00:29:11,622
You want me to help you,
you let my family go.

326
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:14,497
That is the only way.

327
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,295
No.

328
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,954
That is not the only way.

329
00:29:20,719 --> 00:29:24,503
Help them.
Do whatever they want. Please.

330
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:27,515
Or they're gonna hurt Aaron.

331
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,442
You want me to help you
put this thing together.

332
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,036
Are you telling me that these pieces exist?

333
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:52,866
You're sitting in a warehouse full of them.

334
00:29:54,002 --> 00:30:01,713
According to this, each artefact is
generating its own unique magnetic field.

335
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:06,297
These fields determine
where in the overall design the pieces go.

336
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:09,972
The problem is, there's no room for error
in the calculations,

337
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,969
and the equipment you gave me
isn't sensitive enough

338
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:13,971
for me to measure the fields
with perfect accuracy.

339
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:16,733
I need something I don't have.

340
00:30:16,816 --> 00:30:22,155
The magnetometer you're developing
for the Swiss polytechnic.

341
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:28,488
- How do you know about that?
- I know about a lot of things.

342
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:32,624
You're asking me to do something
I cannot do.

343
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:37,001
The magnetometer was designed
to measure magnetic fields in space.

344
00:30:37,087 --> 00:30:40,171
It would be sensitive enough
to do this kind of work.

345
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:44,883
But until it clears patent the polytechnic's
got it locked up in a vault somewhere.

346
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:49,133
The AMCORP Bank.
It's two miles from here.

347
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,432
We're in Switzerland?

348
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:03,398
By tomorrow
you'll have what you need.

349
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,869
Just a few more days, Emily.

350
00:31:09,953 --> 00:31:13,369
Well, I'm still waiting
for the owner to counter.

351
00:31:13,456 --> 00:31:15,864
Yeah. Course it has a garden.

352
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:20,039
As a matter of fact, I'm looking out
the window at the garden right now. Yes.

353
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:22,965
I miss you too, my love.

354
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:29,002
What happens when your wife's ready
to move to a Tuscan villa?

355
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:31,802
I purchased it six months ago.

356
00:31:31,891 --> 00:31:36,767
I made contact with our point man.
He's assembling a team for the bank.

357
00:31:36,855 --> 00:31:40,140
But I must question your decision
to lead them in yourself.

358
00:31:40,233 --> 00:31:45,690
In spite of your precautions, it's wildly risky,
given your new level of notoriety.

359
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:50,442
I'm approaching the finish line
of a 30-year odyssey.

360
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:55,078
I won't let anyone else
take the final steps for me.

361
00:31:58,668 --> 00:32:01,753
This is the flight plan we retrieved
from the plane's data recorder.

362
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:05,005
Sloane left Shipman for an island
off the coast of Bermuda.

363
00:32:05,091 --> 00:32:06,883
We're sending in a team,
but it's doubtful he's still there

364
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:10,005
because the plane then went on to
the Zürich airport in Switzerland.

365
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:11,840
It's a start,
but he could be anywhere by now.

366
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,553
Unless we assume Sloane went
to Switzerland for a reason,

367
00:32:14,642 --> 00:32:16,635
that he isn't merely passing through.

368
00:32:16,728 --> 00:32:20,263
In that case we can expect him
to hire local support. Mercenaries.

369
00:32:20,357 --> 00:32:21,602
I dealt with a guy in Switzerland -

370
00:32:21,691 --> 00:32:24,478
a head-hunter we one used to put together
a black ops team in Western Europe.

371
00:32:24,569 --> 00:32:28,649
He controls most of the local territory.
Sloane would use him if he needed mercs.

372
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,824
Well, assuming he did, if this guy
knows you're CIA, he could tip Sloane off.

373
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:35,694
He doesn't. We hired him
fronting as a French crime syndicate.

374
00:32:35,789 --> 00:32:38,790
Set up a meet.
You two are on a plane.

375
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:56,762
The bank's facial recognition cameras
will measure my underlying bone structure.

376
00:32:56,851 --> 00:32:59,521
The cameras target the distance
between your cheekbones.

377
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:02,391
The prosthetics I'll apply
are lined with a carbon powder.

378
00:33:02,482 --> 00:33:04,973
The system database won't find a match.

379
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:08,022
Even an x-ray would be fooled.

380
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,655
Well, then, let's begin.

381
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:18,237
- Come in, come in, come in
- I'll take your photo for you

382
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:21,700
- Come in, come in, come in
- Drive you round the corner

383
00:33:21,793 --> 00:33:25,292
- Come in, come in, come in
- You know you really oughta

384
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:29,164
- Come in, come in, come in
- Move out of California

385
00:33:54,534 --> 00:33:57,570
And I'm not French Mafia.
I'm CIA.

386
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,581
We've tolerated your existence
because you've been helpful.

387
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:03,244
But that tolerance can end now.

388
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,660
We have reason to believe
one of these men

389
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:09,751
recently approached you
to hire some of your contacts.

390
00:34:09,841 --> 00:34:12,510
Warm or cold?

391
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:15,963
If you'd told me the CIA was
simply interested in my client list,

392
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:19,923
I would have told you to go and make love.
With your mother.

393
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:22,268
Hands.

394
00:34:23,521 --> 00:34:25,181
- You broke my...
- How many came to see you?

395
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:26,898
- You broke my nose.
- Talk to me.

396
00:34:26,983 --> 00:34:29,652
OK, OK. They came.
They hired some men.

397
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:31,527
- For what?
- I don't know the details.

398
00:34:31,613 --> 00:34:32,811
Tell me what you know.

399
00:34:32,906 --> 00:34:34,364
The woman and child are,
I know where they are.

400
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,984
- Where?
- In the other room. Downstairs.

401
00:34:40,413 --> 00:34:42,489
They're here.

402
00:35:00,934 --> 00:35:03,555
Oh, God.

403
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:07,562
It's OK.

404
00:35:07,649 --> 00:35:12,275
- We're CIA agents. You're safe.
- It's OK, buddy.

405
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:15,813
Oh, God.

406
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:21,823
- Where's my husband?
- We're still looking for him.

407
00:35:21,913 --> 00:35:25,448
- We're doing everything we can.
- What's your name?

408
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:27,665
Sydney. Sydney Bristow.

409
00:35:27,752 --> 00:35:29,460
Thank you, Sydney.

410
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:36,211
Syd, one of the guys had a cellphone.

411
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,544
If either Sark or Sloane call directly,
we can trace them.

412
00:35:38,638 --> 00:35:42,802
We still don't get how you detected the tap
we put on the SD-6 network last year.

413
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,383
Yes, that was a noble attempt, gentlemen.
A noble attempt.

414
00:35:45,478 --> 00:35:47,020
But, you see, what happened was,

415
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:49,311
it was interfering with
my online Dungeon Master game.

416
00:35:49,399 --> 00:35:53,860
My gnome kept skipping a frame
every time he swung his battle-axe.

417
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:56,487
Oh, my God.
My first phone call.

418
00:35:56,573 --> 00:35:59,443
Excuse me.
Yeah, this is Marshall.

419
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:00,732
Marshall, it's me.

420
00:36:00,827 --> 00:36:03,448
I need you to run a location trace
on every incoming call

421
00:36:03,538 --> 00:36:05,495
that was made to the phone
I'm talking to you on.

422
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:08,536
Sure, Syd. No problem.

423
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:12,161
OK. I need you to scroll to
the "Incoming Call" menu on the phone,

424
00:36:12,255 --> 00:36:14,046
and then hit "pound", "pound" then "send".

425
00:36:14,132 --> 00:36:16,208
OK. Hold on.

426
00:36:19,137 --> 00:36:22,257
- OK, I'm getting 15 locations.
- Any of them in Zürich?

427
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,385
Uh, two. The first one was made from
a payphone at the Zürich airport.

428
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:26,852
No good. Next.

429
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:30,471
Made from a cellphone. I can probably
triangulate the location if it's on.

430
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,563
- I got it. It's moving.
- Where is it?

431
00:36:33,651 --> 00:36:36,569
Uh, looks like the AMCORP Bank
on New Market Street.

432
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:39,276
I'll you right call back.
We're going to New Market Street.

433
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:54,042
- Marshall, we're heading south.
- A robbery is in progress...

434
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:56,087
Yeah, yeah. I got you.
Make a right at the next light.

435
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:58,463
Hold on.

436
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:25,656
Mr Skopik, welcome. I am Claude Sheurer,
president of AMCORP Bank.

437
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,572
- We spoke on the phone.
- Ah, yes.

438
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,906
Thank you for accommodating me
on such short notice.

439
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:33,036
Not at all. $50 million in cash

440
00:37:33,128 --> 00:37:37,125
is not the kind of thing one likes
to leave under one's pillow for very long.

441
00:37:37,215 --> 00:37:39,884
This is our bank manager, Peter Kunz.

442
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,213
- Hello.
- Pleasure.

443
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:44,007
He will take you to our vault,
while I secure your deposit.

444
00:37:44,097 --> 00:37:45,757
Good.

445
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,647
Can we offer you anything?
An espresso?

446
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:57,140
Oh, thank you very much.
You are most kind.

447
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:58,777
But due to a sensitive stomach,

448
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,898
my physician has prohibited
caffeine from my diet.

449
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,695
Very well. After you.

450
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:11,998
I've spliced into
the face recognition database.

451
00:38:13,251 --> 00:38:15,659
You've cleared their system.

452
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,258
I'll need ten seconds.
Keep him talking a little longer.

453
00:38:26,348 --> 00:38:28,554
Herr Kunz,
may I ask you something?

454
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:34,063
This American war on terrorism, has it
affected your procedure in any way at all?

455
00:38:34,147 --> 00:38:37,064
Looping the feed now.

456
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:42,111
I assure you, our institution
is one of the most secure in the world.

457
00:38:47,202 --> 00:38:50,119
Box 4747.

458
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:01,340
OK. Take a left into the alley.

459
00:39:03,802 --> 00:39:07,799
I guess it's pointless to say
we should wait for backup.

460
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:10,214
Sydney, you're going too fast.
Sydney.

461
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:43,415
- Who's in charge?
- What can I do for you?

462
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:47,969
We're United States agents. Lock down
your vault. You're being robbed.

463
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:51,055
I think you're mistaken.

464
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,519
It's looped.
That's him.

465
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:06,852
Sydney's in the lobby.
She's by the entrance.

466
00:40:16,166 --> 00:40:17,790
Sloane.

467
00:40:20,462 --> 00:40:23,961
- Hold your fire.
- Get down.

468
00:40:32,223 --> 00:40:38,226
I warned you, Sydney. I can't guarantee
your safety in a situation like this.

469
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:42,227
There is no way
I'm letting you walk out of here.

470
00:40:43,276 --> 00:40:44,936
Ah.

471
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:48,527
You must be the man
that Sark told me about.

472
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:50,987
The man that Sydney
was willing to kill me for.

473
00:40:51,076 --> 00:40:52,902
She would have killed you for a lot less.

474
00:40:52,994 --> 00:40:57,455
The police are on their way.
We have Caplan's family. Give up.

475
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:02,249
We've rigged the lower level with
enough C-4 to level the entire city block.

476
00:41:02,337 --> 00:41:08,007
So if we don't walk out of here,
nobody does.

477
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:17,848
You're bluffing.

478
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:25,774
I'm not the only one
carrying a remote trigger.

479
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:30,238
The entire bank is monitored
via satellite by an off-site team.

480
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:36,196
If they don't see me walk out of here
in 30 seconds,

481
00:41:36,287 --> 00:41:38,992
they'll detonate.

482
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:41,999
So I suggest that you both
lower your guns.

483
00:41:47,841 --> 00:41:50,877
Lower your guns.

484
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:10,356
Toss them on the ground.

485
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,738
You, my dear,

486
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:21,368
you'll be driving me out of here.
