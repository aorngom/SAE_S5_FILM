1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,538
- Syd, you can't blame yourself.
- Sure I can.

2
00:00:07,632 --> 00:00:09,589
- Well, don't. She was playing you.
- Maybe she was.

3
00:00:09,676 --> 00:00:11,882
- What were you supposed to do?
- I could have listened.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,924
- She offered to help Will and I said no.
- You talk about her as if you can trust her.

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,588
Which we know we can't.
So maybe we could have played her.

6
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:20,056
If you keep second-guessing yourself,
you're gonna drive yourself crazy.

7
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:23,810
I keep checking my voicemail,
just hoping Will's called,

8
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,891
told us where he is.

9
00:00:25,984 --> 00:00:27,692
So Carrie and I went out.

10
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:33,448
It was great. We got sushi. When we got
there, the guy behind the counter,

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:37,400
they were like "Hey". You know,
when we got there. Like they knew us.

12
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:41,493
- They do that at a lot of sushi places.
- Really?

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,871
Anyway, it was great.
We had a fantastic meal and...

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,874
- So what's the problem?
- Post-fish, when I went to drop her off...

15
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:53,551
This is traditionally, classically the time
where I would - or a man would - kiss her,

16
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:56,009
and, well, I just started sweating.

17
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,968
- How bad?
- Bad. Weird bad. Freak-show bad.

18
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,059
- Did she notice?
- It was like I'd just got out of a lap pool.

19
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:03,853
- OK, you need help.
- Yeah. With the ladies.

20
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:06,774
The thing is, it's sort of a catch-22.

21
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,601
- Go ahead. Keep going, I'm listening.
- To feel comfortable around a woman,

22
00:01:11,696 --> 00:01:15,196
you have to have experience. And to have
experience, you have to not be you.

23
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:19,744
I was almost killed last year and the
doctors didn't think I was gonna make it.

24
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:25,500
And the thing that I learned
from that experience... Thanks.

25
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,797
Syd. Excuse me. We're receiving intel
on a local top-secret server

26
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,421
- from a source outside the building.
- Who's sending the signal?

27
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,625
Your mother.

28
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,214
- We just got an upload.
- I just left you a message.

29
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,764
It's the DNA string
of the person who was doubled.

30
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,174
Mr Kendall, I'm gonna ask that
as soon as Will Tippin is located,

31
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,509
we bring him in to compare this
to his DNA.

32
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,138
We're verifying the data now, sir,
but it looks legit. Legitimate.

33
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:50,482
Yeah, I know what "legit" means.

34
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,192
What else do they know?

35
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,901
Did Sydney tell you what the CIA knows?
Or Jack?

36
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,949
I didn't say Jack was involved.

37
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,116
Of course you did. You said in the car,
you mentioned his name.

38
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,160
God, I'm losing my mind.

39
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,503
The CIA doesn't know anything.

40
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,417
That's the problem.

41
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,391
Doesn't make any sense, does it?

42
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:28,019
The entire CIA,
and they've no idea who the double is.

43
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:32,397
It just shows you how wrong they can be.
And now they think I'm a killer.

44
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,316
Which I am, by the way.
I've killed people.

45
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:39,111
People who were trying to kill you.

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,193
So what? Does that make it easy? Or...

47
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:44,406
Francie, I ended someone's life.
Two people's lives.

48
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:46,573
I'm a killer.

49
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,003
I shouldn't be yelling this.

50
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,717
You're warm.

51
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,058
Hold it.
Hands where I can see 'em.

52
00:03:15,236 --> 00:03:17,312
Yeah, it's him. It's Tippin.

53
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,004
- So tell me.
- We received a file.

54
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:41,803
A DNA string
of the person who was doubled.

55
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,344
- And?
- Your DNA didn't match.

56
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:49,094
And there was no Provacillium
in your blood. You've been cleared.

57
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:53,729
- Thank God for you.
- You're OK.

58
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,195
- What about Francie?
- Francie's been questioned.

59
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,031
- She's at home. She's fine.
- Thank you.

60
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,819
- What I said about not trusting you...
- No, don't worry about it.

61
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,782
I was scared to death.

62
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:10,410
I didn't mean any of those things.
You know that.

63
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,620
I trust you more than I trust anyone.

64
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:18,459
I'm sorry about the cell. They're gonna
need you to stay here for a while.

65
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,919
- They've got a lot of questions.
- OK.

66
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:27,598
And a therapist is gonna work with you
to try to reverse your memory conditioning.

67
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,432
That file, the DNA string.
Was there a name attached to it?

68
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:35,020
- There was, but we don't have any leads.
- What was the name?

69
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,650
AG Doren.

70
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:43,737
I'm just so relieved for him.
It's like I can breathe again.

71
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,159
You know where it's fun to breathe?
Santa Barbara. You ever been?

72
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:50,116
Yeah, I love it. The zoo?
That giraffe with the crooked neck?

73
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:53,243
No, I mean the beach,
the Biltmore, the food.

74
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:56,538
- La Super Rica. You ever been there?
- No.

75
00:04:56,629 --> 00:05:00,295
- OK, we're going this weekend.
- Yeah, come on. As if we can go.

76
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,799
There'll be some emergency, some...

77
00:05:03,887 --> 00:05:05,963
See?

78
00:05:08,475 --> 00:05:10,551
Yours.

79
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,979
Yeah? Yeah, practice is over. Why?

80
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:18,186
No, that wasn't gonna be me.

81
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:23,519
What do you mean, Markey's sick?
How sick? Weiss, come on, man.

82
00:05:23,615 --> 00:05:26,984
OK, OK. OK. Goodbye.

83
00:05:27,077 --> 00:05:30,161
- I have to go in.
- I'm gonna practise so I can kick your ass.

84
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:32,654
Really? Don't forget about Santa Barbara.

85
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,825
Yeah, some day.

86
00:06:17,752 --> 00:06:19,828
You received my intel.

87
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,920
Your friend was cleared.

88
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,342
I told you I'd want a favour.
This is it.

89
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:34,303
266 Kronastrasse, in Zurich.

90
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,428
I've just given you the address
of Sloane's warehouse,

91
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,938
where he's hiding the Rambaldi artefacts.

92
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:45,236
- That's not why you're here.
- Yes.

93
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,491
It's the only reason.

94
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:55,032
- I know you're lying, but I don't know why.
- Sydney, I'm here to help you.

95
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:02,286
Stop being as stubborn as I am.

96
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,251
I knew from the beginning I'd turn myself
in, that I would betray the CIA.

97
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,717
But not you.

98
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,845
I had to be careful.

99
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,008
I needed you to trust me.

100
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,349
But I also couldn't tell you my plan.

101
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:23,100
Sloane had 23 Rambaldi artefacts.
The CIA had 24.

102
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,941
In order to assemble the device,
they all had to be brought together.

103
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,106
Those are the pieces
in Sloane's warehouse.

104
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,986
You stole Rambaldi pieces
from the US government?

105
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:34,034
Yes.

106
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,988
By winning your trust, the CIA's trust.

107
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:42,791
And then, as planned,
I had a proposal to deliver to Sloane.

108
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,955
A proposal that we work together

109
00:07:45,048 --> 00:07:50,042
to take down the Alliance
and raid the CIA all at once.

110
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:55,094
I came up with a scenario where the CIA
needed to let me use their computers.

111
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,469
I used the opportunity
to learn where the US government

112
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:02,227
kept its stash of Rambaldi artefacts.

113
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,395
They were being held
at a secret NSA lab in Nevada.

114
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,772
One month later
Sloane had a team raid the lab.

115
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,984
- I never heard of an NSA raid.
- Of course not.

116
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:16,947
When the time came for my escape,

117
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,446
it was painful.

118
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:25,330
Because my love for you, for your father,
was not a contrivance.

119
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:27,663
Suddenly you want us
to have Sloane's artefacts?

120
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,340
Sydney, I know our relationship
is complicated.

121
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:38,423
But I'm your mother, and I have to believe
that'd be the case under any circumstance.

122
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,392
- Go to Zurich.
- You're insane.

123
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:44,808
One more thing I need to do...
And I'm sorry for this, too.

124
00:08:57,996 --> 00:09:03,073
- Provacillium to the rescue.
- Thanks. The fevers were getting bad.

125
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:05,493
So what are we doing with Tippin?

126
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,876
Nothing. For the moment.

127
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:10,040
Then when am I getting extracted?

128
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:13,169
I don't know what new evidence
the CIA has, but it's gonna lead to me.

129
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,337
Not necessarily.

130
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:20,008
If you disappear now,
you'll be a suspect for sure.

131
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,470
What is it?

132
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,106
Allison...

133
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,399
we can't reverse the process.

134
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:41,241
Markovic's lab was destroyed.

135
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,702
But we're doing everything we can
to retrieve the lost data,

136
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:51,706
and I'm hopeful that we will find a way
to reverse the procedure.

137
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,465
- I may have to stay this way?
- No. No, we'll get you back.

138
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,676
Look at me.

139
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,840
We'll get you back.

140
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:13,404
You don't fancy him, do you?

141
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,985
Tippin?

142
00:10:18,076 --> 00:10:20,567
Don't be stupid.

143
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:35,331
And it didn't occur to you, Mr Brandon,
that a raid on an NSA...

144
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:38,262
I'm not at liberty
to discuss the details of the Nevada raid.

145
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,846
And I'm not at liberty
to respect the way that you do business.

146
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:44,471
How many Rambaldi pieces were stolen?

147
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,853
24?

148
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,729
- That's what my mother said.
- I can confirm that number.

149
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:51,520
And we have to find out about this breach
from Irina Derevko?

150
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,401
The question is,
what is the prudent next step?

151
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,986
She's lying. She has to be.
It's a setup.

152
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:58,817
Then why show up in person?
It's a big risk.

153
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:03,736
From what I know of Derevko,
she's loyal to only one person. Herself.

154
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:07,910
Dixon's right, obviously. I don't know,
maybe this is a valid play for Sloane.

155
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,578
Maybe, but why would
she need us to play it?

156
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:13,797
Guilt? Her motives may be insidious,
her methods loathsome,

157
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:15,791
but she is not unfeeling.

158
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:18,589
I say we send a team.
Proceed with caution, but proceed.

159
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,130
We'll prep to have whatever we find at the
Zurich warehouse brought to the States.

160
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,758
A neutral location.
I propose Evans naval base in Ventura.

161
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:27,928
- I'll call my director.
- Yeah, you do that.

162
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:31,105
Sloane may have most of the pieces
to assemble this Rambaldi device,

163
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:34,357
- but I don't think he has them all.
- The Di Regno heart.

164
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:39,070
- If the NSA has still got it.
- All right, that's enough of your crap.

165
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:42,074
Jack, you go along with the NSA here,
transfer the heart to the naval base.

166
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,034
And let Marshall know
that he's going to Zurich, too.

167
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,406
I want him to confirm what we've got,
or not, ASAP.

168
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:50,915
Weiss, I need you to tell Tippin
we're done with him.

169
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:54,786
- Escort him to the safe house.
- Yes, sir.

170
00:11:55,882 --> 00:11:59,631
Marshall, we're sending you to Zurich.
It's a research mission.

171
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:01,795
We believe we may have gained access
to Sloane's Rambaldi artefacts.

172
00:12:01,888 --> 00:12:04,557
Wow, that's fantastic. I mean...

173
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:08,508
You know who should really go with us
on this mission? Carrie. Miss Bowman.

174
00:12:08,603 --> 00:12:11,937
Because she's NSA,
she works under Brandon,

175
00:12:12,023 --> 00:12:15,392
and she's... would be very helpful.
In the field.

176
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,439
- In the field.
- Please?

177
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,819
- Miss Bowman.
- Yes, sir?

178
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:26,954
You're going to Zurich.
Plane leaves in an hour.

179
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,288
Mr Tippin, I'm Agent Weiss.

180
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:37,541
We're all through here. I'm supposed to
take you to where you'll be staying.

181
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:39,708
Is there a computer I can use here?

182
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:42,968
The name on this DNA file - AG Doren -
I know that from somewhere.

183
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:44,846
- I just wanna check it out.
- Sure.

184
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,054
- Thanks. I'm Will.
- Weiss.

185
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,763
- Eric Weiss.
- Like Houdini.

186
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:52,604
Yeah. Yeah, actually he was
a great-great-uncle of mine.

187
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:55,096
Get outta here. Really?
Can you do magic tricks?

188
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,682
OK, check this out.
OK? You ready?

189
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:03,693
- AG Doren doesn't ring a bell?
- No, still doesn't.

190
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,990
Can I access my <i>Trade Roads</i>
while we're here?

191
00:13:06,077 --> 00:13:08,568
Yeah. What's your password?

192
00:13:09,748 --> 00:13:11,824
"Sydney".

193
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,209
- Thanks.
- I considered becoming a magician.

194
00:13:17,297 --> 00:13:20,084
Then I thought to myself
"What the hell am I thinking?"

195
00:13:20,175 --> 00:13:23,508
- Oh, my God.
- What?

196
00:13:23,595 --> 00:13:26,430
- What is that? What's that list?
- Project Christmas.

197
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,184
It's a CIA black-ops programme
from the '70s.

198
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:32,601
Trained kids as sleeper agents
to be used as future spies.

199
00:13:32,687 --> 00:13:36,555
- What?
- It's a summer camp. There were 20 kids.

200
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:41,688
Allison Doren was supposed to have died
in a car accident.

201
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:53,238
This is Kendall.

202
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:58,410
We've got the Di Regno heart. We're en
route to the naval base. ETA three hours.

203
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,581
Roger that.

204
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,118
OK, we're free of explosives.
You can move in.

205
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,922
- This could be real.
- Let's get Marshall in here.

206
00:14:46,469 --> 00:14:48,011
How's it looking?

207
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:51,880
I don't know, sir. It's not consistent with
any of the Rambaldi artefacts I've seen.

208
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,925
- I was thinking the same thing.
- Well, then what the hell is it?

209
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:01,853
Looks like a waffle iron.

210
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:18,248
It's a setup.

211
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:22,118
- There's nothing here.
- Give me Jack Bristow.

212
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,014
Drop the weapon or you're dead.

213
00:15:56,456 --> 00:15:59,623
Irina Derevko has struck again.

214
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:03,995
Based on her intel, we sent in
some of our finest-trained agents,

215
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:07,208
we took control of a storage facility,
and with the help of a bomb squad

216
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:11,298
we are now in control
of two dozen rusted kitchen appliances.

217
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:15,800
Simultaneously an enemy team ambushed
our caravan, they killed two of our men.

218
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:20,850
And along with the Di Regno heart
Jack Bristow is missing.

219
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:24,522
- What's our next move?
- We scour every source of intel.

220
00:16:24,609 --> 00:16:28,227
Anything halfway concrete, we move on it.

221
00:16:45,964 --> 00:16:48,881
He had so many brilliant creations.

222
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,713
Rambaldi.

223
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:57,721
But there was one in particular,
a machine.

224
00:16:57,809 --> 00:17:01,392
He called it <i>Il Dire</i> - The Telling.

225
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:05,098
The construction consists of 47 pieces.

226
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:07,267
Classic Rambaldi.

227
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,729
As you know, it took me a long time.

228
00:17:11,156 --> 00:17:13,777
Longer than I thought.

229
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:16,405
But I've acquired them all.

230
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:20,622
Including the Di Regno heart.
With your help.

231
00:17:20,707 --> 00:17:23,412
They're in the next room, Jack.

232
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:27,787
I have a team assembling <i>Il Dire</i> right now.

233
00:17:27,881 --> 00:17:30,454
They say it shouldn't be more than a day.

234
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,626
And then what?

235
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:39,551
I've seen things, recently.

236
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:43,935
I've seen what's possible.

237
00:17:44,022 --> 00:17:46,727
There's a change coming, Jack.

238
00:17:47,776 --> 00:17:50,231
Something even I couldn't imagine.

239
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,692
I used to feel sorry for you.

240
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:57,117
Couldn't you sense it?

241
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:59,906
That you'd been abandoned.

242
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,783
Left for dead. Disgraced.

243
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:05,246
I pitied you.

244
00:18:05,335 --> 00:18:09,997
That you needed Rambaldi
to fill the void in your life.

245
00:18:11,007 --> 00:18:13,083
It was like a religion for you.

246
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:18,795
I didn't expect you to understand.

247
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:21,298
Then why keep me alive?

248
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,268
Because we're friends, Jack.

249
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:37,324
- <i>Vous m'appelez d'urgence tout de suite. </i>
- <i>Wann würde die Nachricht anfangen?</i>

250
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:42,863
Any anomalies?

251
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:46,874
Were you close to him? Brandon?

252
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,298
I hated him. Which is why I feel so bad,
if that makes any sense.

253
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,458
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:00,421
You're sweet.

255
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:05,051
I see.
No, actually, that helps a lot.

256
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:07,221
I'm so sor... I'm sorry.

257
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,267
- What's up?
- This is AG Doren.

258
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,269
Allison Doren.

259
00:19:14,362 --> 00:19:18,609
I just talked with her parents, told 'em I was
with NTSB, asked about the accident.

260
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,452
- And?
- It was a bus crash and there was a fire.

261
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:25,865
But at the time the coroner told them
that their daughter's burns were severe.

262
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:29,622
- So they never identified the body.
- No.

263
00:19:32,964 --> 00:19:36,167
- Hello.
- I didn't know Sloane would switch crates.

264
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:37,884
- I promise that.
- Where the hell are you?

265
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:41,919
He must have known I was going to
double-cross him. Somehow he knew.

266
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:46,178
- I am gonna find you. I don't care...
- I don't know where Sloane is. Sark does.

267
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:49,056
It doesn't have to be you,
just make sure someone from the CIA

268
00:19:49,147 --> 00:19:50,974
goes to Välsmakande.

269
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:54,517
Välsmakande. It's a club in Stockholm.

270
00:19:54,611 --> 00:19:56,983
Sark's gonna be there
at ten o'clock tomorrow night.

271
00:19:57,072 --> 00:19:59,527
How stupid are you
to think I would ever believe you again?

272
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:03,199
Ultimately, you do whatever you want.

273
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:06,489
That's what free will is all about.

274
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,581
I've got nothing. You?

275
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:25,257
We're going to Sweden.

276
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:53,870
Everyone's blonde.
Keep thinking I see him.

277
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:57,627
Sark's not here.
As expected.

278
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,957
Your dad's gonna be OK.

279
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,262
I know.

280
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:13,560
So when this is over,
how do we go on vacation?

281
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:17,772
- Well, I was thinking about this.
- Yeah?

282
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:23,021
And I was thinking that we have to stop
talking about it and just book the hotel.

283
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,402
- Just do it.
- Right. We have to think more positively.

284
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:30,658
- I mean, we're going to Santa Barbara.
- We're going. We're just going.

285
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,201
There he is.

286
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:43,501
- I don't get it.
- What?

287
00:21:43,595 --> 00:21:46,382
My mother. Nothing. Let's move.

288
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,969
- Freeze.
- Freeze.

289
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:00,813
See, when I have a gun trained on you
I don't just pull the trigger.

290
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:02,528
Thank you.

291
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,277
- You're welcome.
- Where the hell is my father?

292
00:22:08,078 --> 00:22:11,411
Not a problem.
My loyalties are flexible.

293
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:16,324
Sloane and your father are in Mexico City.

294
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:05,629
- Base camp, we're at sub-level two.
- Copy that, Mountaineer.

295
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:08,719
They're in the basement.
Now what?

296
00:23:09,931 --> 00:23:14,558
The alarm system for Sloane's floor
is located 20 yards down on the north wall.

297
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:16,767
A grey box with a yellow stripe.

298
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:21,389
The deactivation code is 1 -1 -5-6-6.

299
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:27,320
If this intel turns out to be wrong, I will
personally escort you to Camp Harris,

300
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:30,242
and I won't leave
until you're dead and buried.

301
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:34,276
Then I certainly hope
Mr Sloane hasn't changed the code.

302
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:37,457
Mountaineer, there's a grey control box
with a yellow stripe

303
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:40,247
20 yards down on the north wall.

304
00:23:40,337 --> 00:23:45,212
You will enter 1 -1 -5-6-6.

305
00:23:46,509 --> 00:23:48,632
Alpha team,
we've neutralised the central alarm.

306
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,721
- You're go to enter the building.
- Move. Move.

307
00:23:59,898 --> 00:24:02,685
Jack, it's been assembled.

308
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,531
Sir, there's a tactical team
heading up the stairs.

309
00:24:14,621 --> 00:24:17,657
Pack everything and go. Go.

310
00:24:17,749 --> 00:24:20,287
We'll see each other again, Jack.

311
00:24:29,511 --> 00:24:31,254
Jack.

312
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,097
Tell Agent Bristow I've got her father.

313
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:38,475
- Equipment's being loaded on the truck?
- Yes, sir.

314
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,824
Go.

315
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:10,497
- Go after Sloane.
- You get Sloane.

316
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,141
Freeze.

317
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:28,561
I've shot you before.
I will do it again.

318
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:31,025
Keep your hands in the air.

319
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,404
- I'm on the roof. I've got Derevko.
- Roger that.

320
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,366
Get off the ledge.

321
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:47,289
- I'll tell you what you need to know.
- Get off the ledge, now.

322
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,422
Sloane believes he's been chosen
to realise the word of Rambaldi.

323
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,586
But you, too, have been chosen.

324
00:25:56,181 --> 00:26:00,309
- If you think I'm bluffing...
- It's you in the prophecy, Sydney. Not me.

325
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:04,224
Only you can stop him.

326
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:08,850
Good luck, sweetheart.

327
00:26:09,819 --> 00:26:12,773
Get down. Now.

328
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:15,106
I love you.

329
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,997
She jumped.

330
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:49,185
- Any available agents, get to street level.
- I'm on my way.

331
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:57,533
She just climbed into a floor
in the middle of the building.

332
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,820
- Which floor?
- I have no idea. 18th, maybe 19th.

333
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:03,237
I can't tell from here.

334
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:12,085
Sir, it's been almost two hours.

335
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,833
Home Base, we just found an
elevator shaft pried open on the 19th floor.

336
00:27:16,928 --> 00:27:20,262
We think Derevko's left the building.

337
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:26,141
Sir, you're not supposed to throw these
like that. You'll break 'em.

338
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,690
- Hey.
- Hey.

339
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:45,656
- Any news?
- No.

340
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:52,623
Just trying to figure it all out.

341
00:28:00,513 --> 00:28:02,423
You're the best.

342
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:06,050
I gotta get an aspirin.
I'll be right back.

343
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:02,650
You've reached Sydney's cellphone.
Leave a message after the beep.

344
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:05,447
Sydney, it's me. Listen.

345
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:08,324
This is gonna sound insane, but...

346
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:14,667
I just found Provacillium in the bathroom,
and I think that... I think that...

347
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:18,752
OK, just think about it.
I think that the double is Franc...

348
00:29:25,932 --> 00:29:28,257
Fran?

349
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:02,292
It was always you?

350
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:08,045
Allison?

351
00:30:08,141 --> 00:30:10,264
It sucks it turned out this way.

352
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:14,513
That's it. Get on the ground.
Get on the ground.

353
00:30:58,149 --> 00:31:00,557
Sloane's got the device.

354
00:31:02,237 --> 00:31:04,313
And my mother, she...

355
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:07,566
Another day.

356
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,292
- So I did it.
- Did what?

357
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,833
- Booked the hotel.
- No, you didn't.

358
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:23,128
- Yes, I did.
- You didn't? Santa Barbara?

359
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:26,419
Three nights, starting tonight. Probably
the greatest phone call I ever made.

360
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:29,927
- You're a genius.
- Thank you.

361
00:31:30,015 --> 00:31:32,137
So after the debrief
I'll come pick you up.

362
00:31:32,225 --> 00:31:34,301
OK.

363
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,566
Hey.

364
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:51,656
Hi.

365
00:31:51,745 --> 00:31:54,864
- You OK?
- Relatively speaking.

366
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,032
You?

367
00:31:58,209 --> 00:32:00,285
Tired.

368
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:05,999
What's up?

369
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:09,888
- I am so burnt.
- I understand.

370
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,895
You have two messages.

371
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:24,735
- Where's Will?
- I don't know.

372
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:27,191
Hi, Miss Bristow, it's Marybeth
from Director Kendall's office.

373
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:31,741
- I've got him for you, so give us a call.
- Will said he had something to do.

374
00:32:33,912 --> 00:32:36,581
Sydney, it's me. Listen.

375
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:39,334
This is gonna sound insane, but...

376
00:32:39,417 --> 00:32:44,922
I just found Provacillium in the bathroom,
and I think that... I think that...

377
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,419
OK, just think about it.
I think that the double is Franc...

378
00:32:50,512 --> 00:32:52,588
End of messages.

379
00:33:16,454 --> 00:33:18,530
Want some?

380
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:22,494
Sure.

381
00:33:32,846 --> 00:33:36,464
I just have to change out of these clothes.

382
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,734
I just remembered.

383
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:56,404
Francie doesn't like coffee ice cream.

384
00:33:57,078 --> 00:33:59,071
No, she doesn't.

385
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:03,414
Drop the gun.

386
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,209
Drop it.

387
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,710
Dispatch.

388
00:38:22,802 --> 00:38:29,766
This is Officer 2300844 calling for
connection. Confirmation: looking glass.

389
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,343
Stand by.

390
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:36,688
- This is Kendall.
- I just woke up in Hong Kong.

391
00:38:36,775 --> 00:38:41,235
I don't know how long I've been here
or how I got here.

392
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:44,823
Hello?

393
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:49,700
Get to our safe house in Tsim Sha Tsui
as quickly as possible.

394
00:38:49,788 --> 00:38:53,453
- You remember how to get there?
- Of course I do.

395
00:38:53,541 --> 00:38:56,993
I'll make sure they're expecting you.

396
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:59,163
OK.

397
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:10,506
Have they said...

398
00:39:11,726 --> 00:39:15,178
Have they said anything about how
I got here? Do you know any possible...?

399
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:21,524
They've asked you to wait for information,
until your contact arrives.

400
00:39:54,436 --> 00:39:57,555
- They doubled Francie.
- I know.

401
00:39:57,647 --> 00:40:00,933
What happened to Will? To Francie?
Are they dead?

402
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,267
Will's OK.

403
00:40:03,361 --> 00:40:05,603
What? How?

404
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:08,774
You...

405
00:40:10,618 --> 00:40:12,694
Sit down.

406
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:30,338
Vaughn?

407
00:40:35,935 --> 00:40:38,936
We thought you were dead.

408
00:40:46,696 --> 00:40:51,903
They asked me to come back,
to... to explain.

409
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:54,069
Come back from what?

410
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:58,077
What are you talking about?

411
00:41:00,293 --> 00:41:02,618
Vaughn.

412
00:41:04,547 --> 00:41:07,217
Why are you wearing that ring?

413
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,427
Syd...

414
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:18,300
since that night...

415
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:21,972
you were missing.

416
00:41:30,657 --> 00:41:34,275
You've been missing for almost two years.
