1
00:00:03,128 --> 00:00:04,670
Previously on <i>Alias:</i>

2
00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:08,337
- I have a crush on a guy at work.
- Really? Who is he?

3
00:00:08,425 --> 00:00:12,553
Someone in my department. We've worked
together for about a year now.

4
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,804
You're kidding me.
What's his name?

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:16,970
Michael.

6
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,806
- What are you doing?
- Downgrading your network privileges.

7
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:25,941
Pending the outcome of my investigation,
your security clearance has been revoked.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,606
We have a situation. Ariana Kane -
head of Alliance counterintelligence -

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:34,319
she's investigating me in connection
with the murder of Emily Sloane.

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,363
I did not kill Emily Sloane.
But I do have secrets.

11
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,123
And the last thing I can afford,
the last thing Sydney can afford,

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:44,833
is someone discovering that
my loyalty does not lie with SD-6.

13
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,624
Kane needs someone to blame.

14
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:51,712
Since she can't find who really murdered
Emily, she's decided to blame me.

15
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,423
I did not murder your wife.

16
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:58,213
But if I don't find the person who did,
Kane will frame me for it.

17
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,724
I have some leads.
I need you to pursue them for me.

18
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:05,562
- Can I trust you to do that?
- Of course.

19
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,191
This will stay between us.

20
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,814
- Hello?
- Agent Kane, Arvin Sloane.

21
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:15,775
Jack Bristow just left my house.

22
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,913
- I want to report a murder.
- Sit down.

23
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:37,755
- Where was this murder committed?
- San Francisco, last night.

24
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,923
Who was murdered?

25
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:43,848
I have five names - Alliance partners.

26
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:49,815
I need their whereabouts and
phone records for the dates listed.

27
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,644
I've included dead-drop instructions.

28
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:55,319
Assume the usual protocols
have been compromised.

29
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,325
Take it easy.

30
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,316
Dad, get in.

31
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:59,550
- Sydney, what are you doing here?
- Kendall contacted me.

32
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,844
He was worried because you hadn't
signalled in since last night.

33
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,060
- Alliance counterintelligence is after me.
- Alliance? Dad, what the hell is going on?

34
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,311
Someone extorted them out of
$100 million. They think that person is me.

35
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:10,891
Mountaineer, you've got company.

36
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,853
Two vehicles - an outrider
paralleling you one block west

37
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,648
and a pursuit vehicle 100 feet behind.

38
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,229
How long have you known about this?

39
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:20,984
I didn't tell you
because it didn't concern you.

40
00:03:21,076 --> 00:03:24,610
If the Alliance thinks you're lying to them,
they'll kill you. That concerns me.

41
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:27,160
What concerns me is having them suspect
that you're my accomplice.

42
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,656
That's why I've kept you out of it.

43
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,928
Take your next left. Now.

44
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,321
Take your next right.
Your ride's a half-block ahead.

45
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,600
Several months ago, the Alliance
offered Sloane a partnership position.

46
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,609
In exchange he had to kill his wife.

47
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,020
Because Emily had learned
the truth about SD-6?

48
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:45,657
He poisoned her.
Or so he thought.

49
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:50,240
Soon after the funeral,
Sloane began receiving odd messages.

50
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:54,709
Messages designed to indicate
that his efforts had failed.

51
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,748
Followed soon after by a terrifying delivery.

52
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,674
Proof she was still alive.

53
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,046
And in exchange for Emily
they demanded money.

54
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,711
$100 million, which the Alliance paid,

55
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,974
and the blackmailer killed her anyway.

56
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:13,599
The Alliance obviously has to find
someone to blame for this.

57
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,266
So why focus on you?

58
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:17,148
I was no more a suspect than anyone else,

59
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:20,567
but as they examined my conduct
they realised I had secrets.

60
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:25,814
Elements of my alibi that, because of
our work for CIA, I can't fully justify.

61
00:05:25,909 --> 00:05:29,823
- And Sloane, does he think you did this?
- I'm not certain.

62
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:34,409
- What are you gonna do? Stay here?
- For the moment. I'll research what I can.

63
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:37,870
The man I went to meet at the movie
theatre had information about the Alliance.

64
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:40,833
Intel I'm not sure the CIA can access.

65
00:05:40,924 --> 00:05:42,584
- It's SD-6.
- You have to go in.

66
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:46,258
- No. I'm calling in sick. I'm helping you.
- No, Sydney. You can't.

67
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:50,426
The agent heading up the investigation
is not interested in you. Not yet.

68
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:54,051
But if you don't show up,
you will arouse her suspicions.

69
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:56,387
We can't allow that to happen.

70
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,948
OK, let's be honest.
Among life experiences to be avoided,

71
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,990
getting kidnapped
definitely ranks near the top.

72
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,369
Except actually
third grade kinda sucked too.

73
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:59,827
There was this whole thing,
lunch money thing, with the...

74
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,424
Uh, I kinda overdid it,
but you saved my bacon. Thank you.

75
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:11,302
- Marshall, thank you.
- Don't worry about it.

76
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,014
Oh, uh, Mr Dixon.

77
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:16,468
I really never have an occasion
to buy another man a present,

78
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:19,266
except my father for Father's Day, but...

79
00:07:19,356 --> 00:07:22,310
- Anyway, it's cologne.
- Thank you.

80
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,891
I think it's a really nice scent
and it's gonna be nice on you.

81
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:28,521
Not that you need a new scent or anything.
I mean, your natural scent's really...

82
00:07:28,615 --> 00:07:29,729
- very...
- Marshall.

83
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:33,573
- You know, I'll be quiet now.
- I appreciate that.

84
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:40,622
Actually, Mr Sloane, I notice
you're not wearing the tie I gave you.

85
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,370
It's OK.

86
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:47,466
You're looking at a prototype of the Triad's
most startling achievement to date -

87
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:50,717
a quantum gyroscope
missile guidance system.

88
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:54,386
According to the partial specifications
we were able to intercept,

89
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,641
not only is this device
cheap and easy to manufacture,

90
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:01,725
but it is far more accurate
than anything in our current arsenal.

91
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:07,734
It is capable of transforming a '70s-era
Scud into a precision-guided munition

92
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:11,024
with a range and lethality
equivalent to that of a cruise missile.

93
00:08:11,116 --> 00:08:12,907
How did we get these photos?

94
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,741
Last month SD-5 tasked a team of agents
to perform a recon op

95
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:22,666
on the Triad's R&D lab in Nice, France.
Your task is acquisition.

96
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,453
Here we have Karl Schatz.
He's a courier for Triad,

97
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:31,174
and he's transporting the prototype
to Berlin for mass production.

98
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,930
You will intercept it en route.

99
00:08:34,014 --> 00:08:37,596
There is no room for failure on this one.
You can imagine the consequences

100
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:42,227
if enemies of the United States
acquire this technology.

101
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,184
There are so many things
I hate about Arvin Sloane.

102
00:08:45,275 --> 00:08:50,067
But the thing that I hate the most is the way
he wraps his criminal activity in the flag.

103
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,815
Well, we won't let him get away with it.

104
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,607
Before you go we'll make a defective copy
of that gyroscope for you to give to SD-6.

105
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:56,982
We'll need to see those photographs.

106
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,154
Dixon has 'em.
He's already on his way to Nice.

107
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,240
Then we'll have to get a team to France.

108
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,574
When you're through with your mission,
make sure you're holding the gyroscope.

109
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,957
We'll duplicate it on site.

110
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,789
And, Syd, you should know

111
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:12,424
that we've been doing everything we can
to help your father.

112
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:15,464
- You've been helping my father?
- Yeah.

113
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,841
You knew the Alliance
was investigating my father?

114
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:19,763
Yes.

115
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,603
- For how long?
- Two weeks.

116
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,561
- Syd, I understand you're upset.
- Yeah, I am.

117
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,221
- Your father said why we hadn't told you...
- Now I've had time to think about that...

118
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:29,060
It was a question of your safety.

119
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,860
- He was almost killed. I saved him.
- It hadn't gotten to that.

120
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:31,610
But it did.

121
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,894
I didn't want you to have
more on your mind.

122
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,364
Why are you worrying
about what's on my mind?

123
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:35,564
It was a judgement call.

124
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,781
A judgement call that you've been
making for the past three months.

125
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:39,577
Involving you had no upside.

126
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,073
There's no upside
to keeping me informed?

127
00:09:41,164 --> 00:09:44,331
You didn't tell me about Manolo or
that you had discussions with my mother.

128
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:48,118
You didn't even tell me
you were seeing Alice again.

129
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:49,755
Wait. What is this about?

130
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,165
This is about me
being too old to be coddled.

131
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:56,339
Your life is complicated, Sydney.
Forgive me for trying to make it any easier.

132
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,801
I don't need you for that.

133
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:54,863
Jack, I'm sending this
through a secure server.

134
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:59,442
I'm sorry. I informed Ariana Kane
that you visited my house last night.

135
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:02,784
Not because I believe you're guilty -
I don't -

136
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,113
but because I had to.

137
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:09,418
This past summer, when I was
initiated into the Alliance,

138
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:12,337
a device was implanted into my neck.

139
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:16,289
It was intended as a means of ensuring
loyalty among Alliance partners.

140
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:22,838
Among other things, this device tracks
my whereabouts as well as my vital signs.

141
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,882
It also transmits my conversations
back to the Alliance.

142
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:30,513
So, you see, they already knew
you'd been to see me.

143
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:34,936
You offered many suspects,
but all your leads were dead ends.

144
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:37,435
Now I offer one of my own.

145
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,824
Last year, I murdered
a member of the Alliance, Jack.

146
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,737
Jean Briault.

147
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,825
You can understand why I was
reluctant to reveal this.

148
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:53,453
It is quite possible that
the blackmailer was stirred by revenge,

149
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:58,541
that he, or she, was close to Briault.

150
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,218
Stay safe, Jack.

151
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:07,053
Good luck.

152
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:09,681
Briault has a wife and an adult son,

153
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:14,349
but neither would have had the necessary
insight to blackmail the Alliance.

154
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:16,980
And the other partners
considered Briault soft.

155
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,608
No one was sad to see him go.

156
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:21,904
So you have nothing.

157
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,949
Are you considering
going into witness protection?

158
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,443
That would leave Sydney exposed
with no one to watch her back.

159
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:27,617
You'd have to take her with you.

160
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:29,663
And have her spend the rest of her life
looking over her shoulder?

161
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:31,623
That's not an option.

162
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:36,837
Then if you're not here to say goodbye,
why'd you bring this to me?

163
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:40,257
I need someone to brainstorm with.

164
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,510
Surely the CIA has teams
who specialise in these matters?

165
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,969
Forensics, profilers...

166
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,931
Yes, they do.

167
00:12:52,439 --> 00:12:58,441
Have Information Resources
pull everything they have on Briault.

168
00:13:04,576 --> 00:13:08,620
I understand that you requested
Sydney Bristow's computer.

169
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,662
Well, three months ago Agent Dixon

170
00:13:10,749 --> 00:13:13,418
reported evidence
suggesting she was a double agent.

171
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:16,705
That was a misunderstanding.
Dixon came upon Sydney

172
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:19,085
as she was executing an operation
Jack had authorised.

173
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,210
Yes, I read your report.

174
00:13:22,302 --> 00:13:27,260
I think either she was
an accomplice to his blackmail,

175
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:32,805
or else the two of them have been
up to something more long-term.

176
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,303
You must have noticed that Bristow
frequently assigns his daughter

177
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:38,601
to operations of his own design.

178
00:13:38,693 --> 00:13:41,184
Sydney Bristow is an excellent agent.

179
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,988
All the more reason
he would enlist her help.

180
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:59,786
Once you recover the gyroscope, you and
Dixon will separate for your flights home.

181
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:04,839
Our team will be set up in this utility room,
where they'll duplicate the gyroscope.

182
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:08,131
- Any questions?
- Maybe you should go over it again.

183
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,058
It's a pretty complicated plan.
Maybe you could make it easier.

184
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,886
OK, look. I don't want to be here
any more than you do.

185
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,136
Hey. Look who's joining you in France.

186
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,021
- Hey.
- Hey?

187
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:20,689
Three months in the hospital, I get a "hey"?
How about a little sugar?

188
00:14:20,777 --> 00:14:23,102
- I'm glad you're back.
- Thank you.

189
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,565
And thank you for the plant, by the way.
Amazingly I've been able to keep it alive.

190
00:14:26,658 --> 00:14:29,493
All right, bring me up to speed.
What's our plan?

191
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,078
I should get to my plane.

192
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:38,991
I'll see you in France.

193
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,371
OK.

194
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,189
Nothing yet, Syd.
No sign of the courier.

195
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:10,532
Copy that.
Just let me know when to move.

196
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:15,289
- You know what?
- What?

197
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,244
I've already made 47 euros.

198
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:24,956
Hey.

199
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,375
- You sure you don't wanna talk about this?
- There's nothing to talk about.

200
00:15:27,469 --> 00:15:29,378
- I share my fights with you.
- No, you don't.

201
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,712
Yeah, I do. Remember when
Alan pissed in the living room?

202
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:32,471
That was your dog.

203
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:34,799
But I was angry about it
and I let you know how upset I was.

204
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,932
I appreciate you trying to cheer me up.
You don't have to do that.

205
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,685
All right, here's a thought.
Tell her how you feel.

206
00:15:40,774 --> 00:15:43,691
I know, I know. I was the one who said
this is a line you don't cross,

207
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,935
but that was before I nearly died.

208
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:48,698
And you know what they say
about the white light and all that? No.

209
00:15:48,782 --> 00:15:52,115
They're wrong.
It's darkness.

210
00:15:55,538 --> 00:15:57,614
Darkness.

211
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:00,410
I understand.

212
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,337
Game time, Syd.
Here comes our guy.

213
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:14,099
Gyroscope is in a shoulder harness
under his left pec.

214
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:16,222
You can use the Artful Dodger.

215
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:18,385
Right.

216
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,599
Now, if it's not in his briefcase
and it's in his pocket,

217
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,097
here is a little goody
every pickpocket can use.

218
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:26,268
I like to call this baby the Artful Dodger.

219
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:29,564
You know, after that movie, um...

220
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,031
- <i>Oliver!</i>
- Right.

221
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:34,117
"Please, sir. Can I have some more?"
I thought that was a good one.

222
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:38,531
So basically you just turn this guy like that,
flip it on, turn it around,

223
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:41,992
and this little guy will cut through anything.

224
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,165
Damn it, I liked this tie.

225
00:16:57,475 --> 00:16:59,551
Better hurry, Syd.

226
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,481
Syd, move.

227
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:21,656
The waves keep on crashing on me
for some reason

228
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,701
How ya doin'?

229
00:17:29,341 --> 00:17:32,258
It wasn't me.

230
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,432
Damn machine. It happens
every time I go through these.

231
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,055
Whatever.

232
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:56,443
JFK, I went through five times.
They literally had me take off my shirt.

233
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:08,956
Oh, my God.

234
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:12,801
Watch the hands.
Hey. It's not a date.

235
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:18,132
I see. You wanna get your thrills?

236
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:35,147
Thank you.

237
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,744
Good work. I'll see you in LA.

238
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,796
Good work.

239
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,169
Base Ops, this is Boy Scout.
Mountaineer just delivered the package.

240
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,796
We're proceeding with the copy.

241
00:18:55,885 --> 00:19:00,013
They're estimating two hours
till the duplicate's ready.

242
00:19:09,107 --> 00:19:11,183
Listen. Do you wanna go to dinner?

243
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,190
We were driving in town and I saw
this place. Rousseau, I think it's called.

244
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,356
Vaughn, we...

245
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:21,076
- We can't do that.
- Why not?

246
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:24,612
Well, for a million reasons.

247
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:27,576
If Alliance security sees us together,
they'll kill us.

248
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,245
The nearest Alliance cell is in Zurich.

249
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:32,918
The CIA tracks SD-6 security section.
There's been no signals, no movement.

250
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,120
You're serious.

251
00:19:34,215 --> 00:19:35,626
We've been to restaurants
and sat near each other.

252
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:37,756
We've met in parks
and convenience stores

253
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:41,758
and all of them in LA where we are
much more likely to be seen.

254
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:48,597
Two things. One - I think it's not that great
a risk. And two - I'm hungry, I'm starving.

255
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:51,725
We're gonna be together anyway.
Why can't we be eating?

256
00:19:51,816 --> 00:19:53,892
Aren't you hungry?

257
00:19:55,487 --> 00:19:57,775
Yeah, I'm hungry.

258
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,782
- Let's do it.
- Yeah?

259
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,335
I'm gonna change.

260
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,499
- That's a good idea.
- OK.

261
00:20:22,847 --> 00:20:25,932
- And?
- We're going to dinner.

262
00:20:29,479 --> 00:20:32,266
I'm gonna keep my comm channel open.
I need you to monitor the RF frequencies.

263
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,480
Got it. In exchange, I'll take an éclair.

264
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:37,604
No, I'm serious. Any suspect signal,
I wanna know about it. Anything.

265
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:40,068
If they're small, bring at least two.

266
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,864
How we doing over here?

267
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:52,080
Sydney Bristow just left the airport
accompanied by a man.

268
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:54,327
Not Dixon.

269
00:20:55,547 --> 00:20:57,623
Find out who he is.

270
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,641
Well, you speak French
almost as well as I do.

271
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:16,064
- Mademoiselle.
- Thank you.

272
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:20,526
See what you like and I'll be right back.

273
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:51,393
- I think wine would help the situation.
- I was just thinking the same thing.

274
00:21:58,193 --> 00:22:01,893
There must be a dozen ways
to blackmail the Alliance.

275
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,195
All of them far less elaborate than this one.

276
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:09,324
So, we can assume a secondary objective
was to make Arvin suffer.

277
00:22:09,412 --> 00:22:12,497
Someone harbouring an acute hatred.

278
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:14,954
Meaning it could be anyone.

279
00:22:16,002 --> 00:22:19,252
Does the Alliance have
any permanent operations in Peru?

280
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,213
Peru? No. Why?

281
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:26,210
Jean Briault, whenever he travelled,
he would use his credit card.

282
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:32,259
Except here. Six times this past year he
went to Lima, and not a single transaction.

283
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:36,306
I think there's a customs statement.

284
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:43,146
Six arrivals into Chavez Airport.
Each time he declared 70,000 in cash.

285
00:22:43,238 --> 00:22:47,022
Why? What's he doing
with all that money?

286
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:50,402
No investments.
He's not buying art.

287
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,488
Is it possible he was running
his own syndicate?

288
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,118
One the Alliance wasn't aware of.

289
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,375
He can't wire his agents operational
money - the Alliance will spot that -

290
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:01,795
so he bankrolls them in Peru.

291
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:07,256
Assume we're right. Why would they
want revenge for his murder?

292
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,850
I'll have Customs send over
all arrivals and departures into Peru

293
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:17,098
for one week
on either side of Briault's visits.

294
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:21,556
When I was your wife...

295
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:29,320
I would meet my case officer
in his hotel room.

296
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:35,946
I suggest you find out where Briault stayed
and pull the hotel security footage.

297
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:56,225
So I heard you on the phone with Base
Ops. Your code name is Boy Scout?

298
00:23:56,311 --> 00:23:57,853
Yeah.

299
00:23:57,937 --> 00:23:59,052
Why?

300
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:03,643
Um, it goes back to CST - clandestine
service training. You don't wanna hear this.

301
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:06,060
- Vaughn.
- OK.

302
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:09,737
- The Boy Scouts have a motto...
- "Always be prepared."

303
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,280
Well, on my first day I showed up
and I'd forgotten my field manual.

304
00:24:12,369 --> 00:24:14,361
So the instructor said
"That is your one screwup."

305
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:19,330
- "From then on you'd better be prepared."
- This story is a disaster.

306
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:23,878
- Tell her she's pretty. Are you an idiot?
- I'm gonna turn you off now. Goodbye.

307
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:26,037
Sorry.

308
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:28,339
He's not SD-6.

309
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,673
Check US DMV.

310
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:37,469
- What makes you think he's American?
- What makes you think he isn't?

311
00:24:41,022 --> 00:24:43,394
So who's our mystery man?

312
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,955
Tell me about your pets.

313
00:24:58,039 --> 00:24:59,070
- What?
- Your pets.

314
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,324
I wanna know about every pet
you've ever had.

315
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,499
Look at that.

316
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,668
Michael Vaughn.

317
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,848
- US Department of State.
- Son of a bitch.

318
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:18,384
He's CIA.

319
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:28,227
Playing pool.
I can see it.

320
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,188
We should play sometime.

321
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:36,443
So, you liked everything?

322
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:43,950
So, uh, it is too late for you
to set out for Avignon,

323
00:25:44,044 --> 00:25:46,998
and you had much to drink.

324
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:49,840
Upstairs I have an inn.

325
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:53,091
And tonight you are my guests. Please.

326
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,138
Take your time.

327
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,859
Did you ask him to do that?

328
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:19,818
There are so many issues with this...

329
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:25,785
Hold on a second. I think we should
have an open mind about this.

330
00:26:25,877 --> 00:26:27,751
An open mind?

331
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:34,884
It'd be rude to overlook such a generous
offer without proper consideration.

332
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:39,798
- I wouldn't dream of it.
- OK.

333
00:26:39,891 --> 00:26:44,470
- But there are clearly issues.
- Yes. I don't disagree.

334
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:56,857
OK.

335
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:04,616
Good. Right on time.

336
00:27:07,002 --> 00:27:07,950
Go ahead, Base Ops.

337
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:11,211
Infosec just called.
Interpol reported a network intrusion.

338
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:15,509
Five minutes later, someone hacked into
US DMV and downloaded Vaughn's info.

339
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:18,215
Both attacks originated from Nice.

340
00:27:20,223 --> 00:27:21,931
Boy Scout, do you copy?

341
00:27:22,017 --> 00:27:24,554
Boy Scout, this is Field Station.
Do you respond? Boy Scout.

342
00:27:24,644 --> 00:27:25,925
What's the name of the restaurant?

343
00:27:26,021 --> 00:27:27,894
Where they're having dinner,
what's the name of the restaurant?

344
00:27:34,696 --> 00:27:37,103
- Hello.
- You've been made. Get out of there now.

345
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,776
Syd, behind you.

346
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:47,115
Go. Go.

347
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:21,106
Gun. Toss it over.

348
00:28:24,579 --> 00:28:26,322
On your knees.
Hands behind your head.

349
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,371
Down.

350
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,534
Get down.

351
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:33,921
Potesh, Jonathan.
ID: six Tango five Charlie David.

352
00:28:34,005 --> 00:28:36,710
Patch me through to Los Angeles -
Ariana Kane.

353
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:54,268
This is Kane.

354
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:57,443
Hello? Hello?

355
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:00,984
Hello?

356
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,202
Take the car.
I'll have Weiss pick me up.

357
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,496
I'll pick up the copy of the gyroscope
before I get on the plane.

358
00:29:10,583 --> 00:29:11,828
We're aborting the countermission.

359
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:14,374
When these guys don't show up,
SD-6 is gonna investigate.

360
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:17,297
They can't prove anything, but this is
the one time we can't deceive them.

361
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:20,134
- There have to be options.
- We have to give SD-6 what they want,

362
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:23,053
as dangerous as that is. You know that.

363
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:25,510
We were so stupid.

364
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,805
- It's my fault.
- That's not true.

365
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,804
You have to go.

366
00:29:37,944 --> 00:29:40,233
I'll see you back in LA.

367
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,054
- Hey.
- Hey.

368
00:30:09,142 --> 00:30:11,894
- This your debrief for Kendall?
- Yeah.

369
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:17,604
You can't show him this.
No, I'm serious. If Kendall sees this...

370
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,981
He needs to know why SD-6
has the real gyroscope.

371
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:23,902
I agree. I think so too,
but this requires a little creativity.

372
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,650
Look, tell him it was my fault. OK?

373
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:29,656
Tell him that grinding the lenses
took a little bit longer than expected

374
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:30,944
and we weren't able
to make Sydney's plane.

375
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,830
- I won't let you cover for me.
- I'm not.

376
00:30:32,916 --> 00:30:36,201
But it's partially my fault too. I'm the one
that told you to take her on a date.

377
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:38,417
- You told me to tell her how I feel.
- Whatever.

378
00:30:38,505 --> 00:30:40,378
I'm three months past
a near-death experience.

379
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,173
What were you listening to my advice for?

380
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:45,378
I'm recommending that I be replaced
as her case officer.

381
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:47,676
OK, now you're just being stupid.

382
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:51,429
- I'm sorry but that's ridiculous.
- I nearly blew our operation inside SD-6,

383
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:53,427
not to mention
putting Sydney's life in danger.

384
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,355
She wanted to go to dinner too.
She's a big girl. She knew the risks.

385
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:58,313
My point is that
my judgement was compromised.

386
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,354
Not to mention all the damage
that you and Sydney have done to SD-6.

387
00:31:01,444 --> 00:31:03,770
Have you given any thought to the fact
that maybe all that work was done

388
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:07,315
because of the way
you guys feel about each other?

389
00:31:08,076 --> 00:31:10,152
How's that for spin?

390
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,363
It's not bad.

391
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:19,408
Whatever you decide to do, just make sure
you discuss this with Sydney first, OK?

392
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,995
I mean, this affects her too.

393
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,638
Anything?

394
00:31:33,727 --> 00:31:37,641
Whenever Briault went to Peru,
he stayed at Hotel Cero Cantidad.

395
00:31:37,731 --> 00:31:40,518
We're scanning everyone
who passes through the lobby.

396
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:44,855
If he met with any assets,
they'll show up on the federal database.

397
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:48,113
- This is Briault?
- That's him last February.

398
00:31:48,199 --> 00:31:50,441
That's him 2001, November.

399
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:53,577
- 2001, September.
- Stop.

400
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,988
Who's that with him?
Can we enhance this?

401
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,407
The shadows are pretty severe.

402
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:00,873
- I can boost the gamma.
- Are they together?

403
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:03,749
Let me try something here.

404
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,916
This won't be perfect.

405
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:18,726
Jack, I just saw McCarthy.

406
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:21,731
- Did he tell you about Kane?
- She and Briault were having an affair.

407
00:32:21,816 --> 00:32:23,394
I can't stand that I didn't
put that together myself.

408
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:26,735
- He also says you're going to SD-6.
- To prove Kane blackmailed the Alliance.

409
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,446
You know this how?

410
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:32,280
The very day Sloane handed over
$100 million in bearer bonds,

411
00:32:32,369 --> 00:32:34,242
Kane opened an account in Monaco.

412
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,867
The contents of that account
are protected by privacy laws.

413
00:32:36,956 --> 00:32:39,494
But SD-6 utilises their cover
as Credit Dauphine

414
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:41,956
to acquire illicit access to that information.

415
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,417
If I can get on their network
I can verify her balance.

416
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:48,669
But this is based on your assumption that
Kane just parked 100 million in the bank.

417
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:52,093
My point is, if you're wrong, they'll kill you.

418
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,181
Let me contact the director.
The CIA can verify what's in the account.

419
00:32:55,266 --> 00:32:58,885
He'd have to get General Counsel
to sign off. That's minimum 48 hours.

420
00:32:58,978 --> 00:33:00,010
I may be safe here,

421
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:03,639
but if they haven't already,
they'll soon begin to suspect Sydney.

422
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:06,105
But I appreciate the offer.

423
00:33:26,006 --> 00:33:28,212
Jack Bristow's here.
He's in the building.

424
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:30,173
The security log shows
he came in two minutes ago.

425
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,388
Seal the exits. No one leaves until
we find him. Who monitors closed circuit?

426
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:01,914
- Jack.
- Can I help you?

427
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,001
Yes. Come with us, please.

428
00:34:21,394 --> 00:34:23,470
Hello, Jack.

429
00:34:24,689 --> 00:34:27,097
There's a plane waiting
to take us to London,

430
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:33,526
but I thought we should wait for
your daughter to return before we left.

431
00:34:33,615 --> 00:34:35,904
I came here to investigate a blackmail,

432
00:34:35,992 --> 00:34:41,153
but you've proven far more compelling
than a simple thief.

433
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:46,708
I know what you did.

434
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:48,871
Do you?

435
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,959
I'm eager to hear what that may be.

436
00:34:54,761 --> 00:34:59,506
Sodium Pentothal.
Won't take more than a few minutes.

437
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,090
Then we'll talk about Sydney.

438
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,665
Five minutes longer
and I would have told everything.

439
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:29,914
Sydney and I would have been revealed
as double agents and killed.

440
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:33,208
Fortunately Sloane saw the email
that I sent him from the server room

441
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,541
detailing what I discovered.

442
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:45,674
Ariana Kane had in fact deposited the
bearer bonds into that Monaco account,

443
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:48,475
but only long enough
to convert them into cash,

444
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,649
which she then transferred out.

445
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,774
And have they recovered the cash?

446
00:35:53,862 --> 00:35:55,237
Not yet.

447
00:35:55,321 --> 00:35:57,813
- And Arvin never questioned why you ran?
- No.

448
00:35:57,907 --> 00:36:02,569
He realises Kane was on a witch-hunt,
that running was a valid option.

449
00:36:02,662 --> 00:36:08,368
In fact, he's taking a week off
and leaving me in charge while he's gone.

450
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,748
Thank you for everything.

451
00:36:14,382 --> 00:36:17,585
- There is one thing that strikes me as odd.
- Yes. Me too.

452
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:20,168
You said
Sloane requested Kane to investigate.

453
00:36:20,263 --> 00:36:23,597
The one person who had
an apparent motive for blackmail.

454
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:28,013
- Someone easy to frame.
- Interesting theory.

455
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:30,180
Or not.

456
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:39,155
- Hey.
- Hey.

457
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,692
- What did Kendall say?
- He told me about your father.

458
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:45,905
He didn't mention anything about our date,
if that's what you mean.

459
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:50,291
- Have you written your mission debrief?
- No, not yet.

460
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:55,371
If I tell the truth, at the least,
they'll remove me as your case officer.

461
00:36:55,465 --> 00:37:00,921
But despite what we did, how stupid
we were, I know we do good work.

462
00:37:01,012 --> 00:37:04,132
- We need to stay together.
- I agree.

463
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:07,593
We do good work.

464
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:14,556
I don't understand.

465
00:37:14,651 --> 00:37:17,984
When I got back to SD-6
and saw my father,

466
00:37:18,071 --> 00:37:21,985
it was clear no one would be asking
questions about Kane's missing agents.

467
00:37:22,075 --> 00:37:27,152
So I gave Sloane the counterfeit
gyroscope. This is the real one.

468
00:37:31,418 --> 00:37:34,454
- We win.
- At the airport you took them both.

469
00:37:34,546 --> 00:37:37,037
Always be prepared.

470
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:49,389
So I had a blood test today,
for health insurance.

471
00:37:49,477 --> 00:37:51,470
There was this guy there giving blood.

472
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:57,731
He was kinda cute so I look over and I
smile at him, and guess what happens?

473
00:37:57,819 --> 00:37:59,776
He fainted.

474
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:03,777
- You just guessed that he...
- It's a blood-sugar thing.

475
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,651
OK, well, fine. Before I realised that,
I was pretty psyched.

476
00:38:07,746 --> 00:38:12,787
I was thinking "Wow. My smile
made a man go weak in the knees."

477
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:18,083
Hey, oh. How's... Any news about
that guy Michael from work?

478
00:38:19,924 --> 00:38:23,044
No. There's not gonna be.

479
00:38:24,888 --> 00:38:28,838
I realised it's not worth fantasising about.

480
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:32,763
Nothing's ever gonna come of it.

481
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,772
Right.

482
00:38:38,777 --> 00:38:42,644
OK. Get your coat.
We're going for cocktails.

483
00:38:42,739 --> 00:38:44,019
- Oh, no, Francie.
- I'm serious.

484
00:38:44,115 --> 00:38:46,108
You need the biggest cosmopolitan.
Come on.

485
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:50,697
Up, up, up, girl. We're gonna go out,
paint this town. Let's do it.

486
00:38:50,789 --> 00:38:52,865
Shake this off.

487
00:39:39,504 --> 00:39:42,173
- Damn, I'm good.
- It's working?

488
00:39:42,257 --> 00:39:43,419
What did I tell you?

489
00:39:43,508 --> 00:39:47,091
You asked me if this was possible.
I said "Give me three months."

490
00:39:47,178 --> 00:39:50,263
Look at that. 89 days later.

491
00:39:50,348 --> 00:39:52,424
- They can't hear us?
- Nope.

492
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:55,435
The hard part was cracking
the spread spectrum algorithm.

493
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,933
The transmission in here
has to match their receivers exactly.

494
00:40:00,025 --> 00:40:02,895
You see that?
That's the switch.

495
00:40:02,986 --> 00:40:04,445
What are my associates hearing?

496
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:08,147
I programmed in a variety of
ambient sounds - rain, TV chatter.

497
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:12,191
Right now you're cruisin' down the 405
listening to Miles Davis.

498
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:13,781
And biorhythms?

499
00:40:13,872 --> 00:40:15,995
Piece of cake.
EKG readings, breathing patterns...

500
00:40:16,082 --> 00:40:20,744
As far as they know,
you're as steady as Charlie Watts.

501
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:25,498
Ten mil. Holy God.

502
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:32,383
- Must feel good.
- What's that?

503
00:40:32,474 --> 00:40:36,258
Being able to speak freely.
Nobody knowin' your business.

504
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,641
Yeah, it does.

505
00:41:19,396 --> 00:41:21,887
We did it.

506
00:41:28,363 --> 00:41:31,862
Are you sure?
Are you sure it worked?

507
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:34,026
Yes, my love.

508
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:38,111
We're free.
