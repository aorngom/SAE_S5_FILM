1
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm counting on you,aleksander.

2
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,800
I'll call youwhen it's done.

3
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:03,700


4
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,500


5
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,800


6
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,700


7
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,600
Visa.

8
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:33,600
Hi.

9
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:08,200
You're looking at the work of an emergingterrorist organization known as the beograd faction.

10
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,100
Yesterday at 5:00 they hitthe indonesian embassy in copenhagen.

11
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,100
It was their fourth major attackwithin the last several months.

12
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,100
And their firstovertly political act.

13
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,800
If that's in fact what it is.

14
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,500
Just looking at their files, they haven't claimedany ideology.

15
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,500
They've made no demands,no pronouncements.

16
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,100
Something doesn't add up.

17
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,500
Langley is desperateto acquire intel on this group.

18
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,000
To that end, they placedan undercover agent within the organization.

19
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,500
His name is thomas raimes.

20
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,400
He specializes in prolongeddeep cover work.

21
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,500
He's been in placefor the last few months posing as a document expertin forging, counterfeiting.

22
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,700
Two weeks agohe warned langley of a pending attackin denmark.

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,500
And he never followed upwith the details?

24
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,500
Agent raimes has missedthe last four meetings with his handler and hasn'tnotified headquarters.

25
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,200
Which means he was eithercaught or killed.

26
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:59,600
In one of his lastcommunications, he was able to identifythe leader of this group, a man named milos kradic.

27
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,200
Echelon intercepts suggestthat kradic has a meet set up tomorrow at a locationin amsterdam.

28
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,900
Dixon, vaughn, you'll runsurveillance on that location.

29
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,300
If kradic shows up, neutralize himand take him into custody.

30
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,000
Sydney, coordinate with jackwhen he gets in.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,600
You'll run the operationsfrom here.

32
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,900
Until then, find outwhat other motives they could have hadfor hitting that embassy.

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,900
Okay, that's it.

34
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,700
Thank you.

35
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:30,800
Hello?

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,900
Nadia.

37
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,400
Sophia?

38
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,800
Is that you?

39
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,400
It's so goodto hear your voice.

40
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,200
Yours too.

41
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,400
I'm so surprisedyou're calling.It's been...

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,800
a long time, yes.

43
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,200
I am flying to los angeles.

44
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,200
I was hopingwe might catch up.

45
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,200
I'd love to.

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,200
Why don't imeet you at the airport?

47
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,900
That'll be wonderful.

48
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,100
I arrive in the morning.

49
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,300
Okay, I'll see you then

50
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,900
So how long has it been since you've heardfrom sophia?

51
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Like 10 years.

52
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,700
Why has she cometo los angeles now?

53
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,300
I don't know.She didn't say.

54
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,800
Are you sureyou're okay with this?

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,300
She can stay as longas she wants.

56
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,300
You know that.

57
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,000
Thanks. 

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,400
Where else am I gonna hearembarrassing stories about you as a kid?

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,600
You okay?

60
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,500
Yeah, I'm fine.

61
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,300
You don't seem very excited.

62
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,500
I know, but I am.

63
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,100
It's just last time I saw her,I was in jail.

64
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,100
I don't want to bea disappointment to her.

65
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,800
Who knows if she'lleven recognize me?

66
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,900
Oceanic airlines,nonstop flight to sydney is now ready for boardingat gate 17.

67
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,200
Oceanic airlines nonstop flightto sydney is now rdy...

68
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,900
sophia.

69
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,100
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,900
I'm so sorry.

71
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,100
What happened?

72
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,800
I didn't have anywhereto go.

73
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,800
It's so good to see you.

74
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:13,400
For the last few weeks, I had a feeling that iwas being watched.

75
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,200
I kept seeing the same faceseverywhere I went

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,600
Then last nightI came home early from work, and they were in my house. 

77
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,400
As soon as I walked in,they attacked me.

78
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,200
What did they want?

79
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,300
I don't know.

80
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,600
Did they take anything?

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,800
I honestly don't know.

82
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,100
When I regainedconsciousness,

83
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:45,600
the house was ransackedand they were gone.

84
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,800
I couldn't stay there.

85
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
I'm sorry I came herelike this.

86
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,300
 It's okay.

87
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,700
You did the right thing.

88
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,100
We should let herget some sleep

89
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:56,100
Yes

90
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,100
I'm sorry we had to meetunder these circumstances. 

91
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,800
You're family to nadia,which means you're familto me.

92
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,100
I'll see to it that you'rewell taken care of.

93
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,000
You have nothing to worryabout from now on.

94
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,600
Thank you.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,300
That woman took careof nadia when I couldn'T.

96
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,200
I owe her.

97
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,700
As soon as I get backto the office, I'll reach out to ourconnections in portugal.

98
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,600
Whatever I can do.

99
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,900
You need a ride?

100
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,100
No, thank you.

101
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:33,700
Okay.

102
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,200
I'll meet you there.

103
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,800
That should takethe edge off.

104
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,400
It's less painfuthan the last few times.

105
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,200
Glad to hear it.

106
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,800
I've increased the dosageof lipoic acid.

107
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,700
Sorry to say,you may experience some increasedside effects.

108
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,000
It's not a cure, but, um, should keep it at bayfor a while.

109
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:26,100
I've been lookinginto studies from the instituteof radiology in prague based on treatment protocolsin chernobyl --

110
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,400
it's apples and oranges,jack.

111
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,500
We're not talking aboutalpha particles and beta particles,gamma or neutron rays.

112
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,800
The radiationyou were exposed to when you walkedinto that reactor --

113
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,300
well, it's a differentfruit altogether.

114
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,200
Thene'll keep looking.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,100
20 years I've known you.

116
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,900
You're not one iotaless stubborn.

117
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,500
How's sydney?

118
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,000
She's doing well.

119
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,500
I remember when she wasjust starting school.

120
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Where do the years go?

121
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Jack, I've watchedcountless people die.

122
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,500
Had to look into my patients'eyes when I tell them what they have is terminal.

123
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,500
And you know what? 

124
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
That stuff about laughterbeing the best medicine?

125
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,500
It's a load of bunk.

126
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,500
I assume you have a point.

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,700
A clean conscience --

128
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,400
that's a treatmentI can stand behind.

129
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,600
We both knowhow this is going to end.

130
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,400
We can filter your bloodtill the cows come home, but there's no changingthe outcome.

131
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,600
Clear your conscience,jack.

132
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,000
That would takeanother lifetime at least.

133
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,700
I'm not suggesngyou write your memoirs.

134
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,500
Although I'm sure they wouldmake a hell of a read.

135
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,100
 Start small.

136
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:43,000
Talk to your daughter.

137
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,000
She's better offnot knowing.

138
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,000
Jack, these secretsyou're keeping --

139
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,600
they're not yours to keep.

140
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,100
We've been waitingover an hour

141
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,000
Think kradic's gonna show?

142
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,000
I hope so.

143
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,700
You have historywith the target? 

144
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,600
I knew the undercoveragent --

145
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,900
raimes.

146
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,700
From langley?

147
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,400
We were in the corpstogether.

148
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,000
Force recon.

149
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,100
Toughest guy in our platoon.

150
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,100
Didn't think the bullet wasmade that could take him down.

151
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,100
We don't know that he's dead

152
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,000
He could've been captured.

153
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,800
If raimes were alive,he would have made contact.

154
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,800
Okay, there's kradic. 

155
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
There's another guy there.

156
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,100
Brown jacket.

157
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:51,800
You see him?

158
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
That's raimes.

159
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,400
Do you think he's gonerogue?

160
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,800
You've grown into a beautiful woman, you know.

161
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,400
so different from the girl I once knew.

162
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,000
You were so angry then.

163
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,400
I know it's hard to believe 

164
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,100
at least it is for me --

165
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,300
but I have a home now, a family..

166
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,000
I finally feel like I belong somewhere.

167
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,600
Your father's a good man.

168
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,400
I can tell.

169
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,900
You should rest now.

170
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,400
I'll be by tonight to check on you

171
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,800
Nadia, wait.

172
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,000
It's san marcos, the orphanage's namesake.

173
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:31,100
My happiest times were there watching over you girls.

174
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,200
I want you to have it.

175
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,700
I can'T.

176
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,700
Please.

177
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,800
It is my way of thanking you for taking care of me. 

178
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,200
Whoa!

179
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,500
Oh, hey.

180
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,800
I -- sorry, mr. Sloane.

181
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,700
I was testing out a mod on a virtual imager, and, well, you looked a little freaky.

182
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,400
There's a latent fingerprint in here.

183
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,000
I want to get everything you can on the person it belongs to.

184
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,400
I want it kept between us.

185
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,000
Yeah.

186
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,200
Sure, no problem. 

187
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,400
Thank you.

188
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,400
Dad, dixon and vaughncalled in.

189
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,700
They found raimes.

190
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,500
He's alive.

191
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,400
He's traveling with kradic.

192
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,200
Have our team shadow raimes.

193
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,000
The second he's alone,pull him aside for questioning.

194
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,800
I want to know why he hasn'tcontacted langley.

195
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,800
I'll let them know.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:47,700
Dad? 

197
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,500
Let me know when dixonand vaughn have secured raimes.

198
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
I'll keep you posted. 

199
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,900
Got the target.

200
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,600
He just ordereda whiskey straight up.

201
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,500
Okay, go for it.

202
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

203
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,600
I didn't see you there.

204
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,200
Cheers.

205
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,100
We're in amsterdam.

206
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,700
This isthe best place we can find?

207
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,300
No.

208
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:57,700
If I chose the meet, we'd be in a park or near a beautiful canal. 

209
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,600
where are you going?

210
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,000
where are you going?

211
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,900
Last time I saw you like thiswas in a bar in baghdad.

212
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,500
Marcus.

213
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,800
What are you doing here? 

214
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,300
Langley assumed you werecompromised.

215
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,900
What's going on?

216
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
The embassy bombing.

217
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,100
You warned of an attacksomewhere in denmark two weeks ago, then nothing.

218
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,600
Why didn't you senda second warning that the bomb would go off? 

219
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,500
You know what?

220
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:48,900
I'll fill out a report later.

221
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,200
Right now I gotta getback out there, because kradicis meeting with an associate.

222
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Then talk fast.Tom, we need answers. 

223
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,300
You don't understand.

224
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,400
So explain it to us.

225
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,800
Why haven't you checked inwith your handlers?

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,100
Kradic is paranoid.

227
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,900
If iwould have radioed in --

228
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,000
there are other ways.

229
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,300
I have to report in, tom.

230
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,000
And right now, we're lookingat two scenarios.

231
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,500
Either you blew your intel,or you've gone over.

232
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,200
Which is it?

233
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,100
You think I sold out? 

234
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,000
 You tell us.

235
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,700
All right, I had the intel,okay?

236
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,000
But if I would havewarned langley, kradic would have knownwe were on to him.

237
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,900
So you decided to let15 people die? 

238
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,100
I had my reasons.

239
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,200
We're listening.

240
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,800
Kradic is after a new weapondeveloped by the indonesians.

241
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,200
It's a water contaminant. 

242
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,200
It can wipe outwhole ecosystems.

243
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,000
Kradic has a line on it.

244
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,200
The embassy bombing was crucialto acquiring the weapon.

245
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,300
It was a handful of livesagainst a half a million.

246
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,800
That's not your callto make.

247
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,100
You weren't there.

248
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,500
Now, look, if I'm notback in a few minutes, kradic is gonna knowsomething's wrong.

249
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,200
Yes, 15 people died, but if we don't recoverthat weapon,

250
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,600
it'll be hundredsof thousands.

251
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,400
So, you gonna let mewalk out that door, or what? 

252
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,800
Your call, marcus.

253
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,500
developed a sample of hydrosec,but he didn't know where.

254
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,200
So he bombed the embassyas cover for the intel theft. 

255
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:23,400
Emergency protocoldictates that if a bomb goes off, all confidential intelligence istransferred to off-site servers.

256
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,800
The explosion triggeredthose protocols

257
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,200
Kradic must have beenprepared to intercept the outgoing data

258
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,500
The location of the hydrosecmust have been in those files.

259
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,200
He knows where it is,and now he's putting together a team to steal itfrom the indonesians.

260
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,300
Indonesian officialsdeny their intelligence has been compromised.

261
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,300
What else could they say?

262
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,200
If they admit to developinghydrosec, they'd be violatinginternational weapons treaties.

263
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,900
We're talking in circles here.

264
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,900
The only option we've got is to make kradic lead usto the weapon.

265
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,300
We could take him out beforehe gets a chance to use it.

266
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,200
Dixon, what's yourtactical assessment?

267
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:59,200
Considering the situatn, I think our best bet is tokeep agent raimes in the field.

268
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,400
Agreed.

269
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,700
You and vaughnwill shadow.

270
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,600
Copy that.

271
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,000
Go check on raimes.

272
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Make sure he's okay.

273
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,000
We'll outfit you for comms.

274
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,600
No dice.

275
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,900
Kradic has state-of-the-artcountersurveillance detection.

276
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,200
If I show up therewired for sound, I'll light uplike a christmas tree.

277
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,600
Then we'll modify the comms.

278
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,800
Spread-spectrumburst transmitters.

279
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,700
Should be beyond kradic'scapabilities.

280
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,700
It'll take us a few minutesto get them ready

281
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
I'll brush past youwith them.

282
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:30,200
Fine.

283
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,600
I'll meet youat the bar in 10 minutes

284
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:32,900
Wait.

285
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,500
This meet --who is it?

286
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:36,300
 A hacker.

287
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
Linus halsey.Why?

288
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,600
Does kradic know this hackerface to face?

289
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,100
You're thinkingof switching him out?

290
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,400
Well, you stand a better chancewith another man on the inside.

291
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:49,800
Fine.

292
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,500
But you better hurry.

293
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,700
He'll be here in one hour.

294
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,100
Hey, what the hell?

295
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,900
Where did you go?

296
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,000
Let me tell you something.

297
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,100
Shooting whiskey on an emptystomach --

298
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,800
not good.

299
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,400
What's the matter?

300
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,600
Milos pushing you around again?

301
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,100
He's waiting.

302
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:06,800
You're like a little girl.

303
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,500
Come on, let's go.

304
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,000
I'll start with langley,see if they have an open file on halsey.

305
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:15,700
If there's a current file photo,we can run his faceprint through interpol'sbiometric city scan. 

306
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,300
Make it fast.

307
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,200
We don'thave much time.

308
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,000
Mr. Sloane, sir.

309
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:25,300
Mr. -- Here's that background checkthat you asked me to run.Yeah.

310
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Sophia vargas.

311
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,500
Yeah, you actually probablyjust want to skip to the last page.

312
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,200
Thank you, marshall.

313
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,500
Sure.

314
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,300
I found the hacker,linus halsey.

315
00:18:55,300 --> 00:19:01,200
He was an mit graduatewith a degree in nonlinear cryptoalgorithsmsand stochastic systems analysis.

316
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,500
Because if they called it"code-breaking," they couldn't charge30 grand tuition

317
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,500
Okay, I'm linked withamsterdam's urban surveillance network.

318
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,200
I'm checking the databasefor hotel reservations.

319
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,900
Got him. 

320
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Hotel ruisseau. 

321
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,900
It's just a few blocks overfrom where they are.

322
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
Got eyes on halsey.

323
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,500
Okay, let me knowwhen you've got him, and I'll head inside.

324
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,700
Shotgun, what's going on?

325
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,200
Dixon, coming your way.

326
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,700
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

327
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,600
I would have had him.

328
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,700
I know.

329
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Hey

330
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,500
Good workon hotel ruisseau.

331
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,600
They caught halsey.

332
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,500
Thanks.

333
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,400
 We aim to please.

334
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
You're in a good mood.

335
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,600
Yeah, I guess so.

336
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
So things went well withsophia after we left?

337
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,600
Yeah

338
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,200
I've missed herso much.

339
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,300
It's been a long time.

340
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,200
I was so different back then

341
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
You wouldn't have known me.

342
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,200
I bet I would have.

343
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:15,600
No

344
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,000
I was crazy, wild.

345
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,900
I don't know what sophiasaw in me.

346
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,400
She was always telling meI was her special one.

347
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:29,400
For years after I leftthe oranage, that was the only thingI could hang on to.

348
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,800
I knew someone, somewherebelieved in me. 

349
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,000
You were lucky to have a personlike that in your life.

350
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,000
Yeah.

351
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,600
Why did you really come here?

352
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Tell me

353
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,100
I don't know what you mean.

354
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,600
I know all aboutjose pedraza.

355
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,900
I know how the argentinepolice found his body.

356
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,600
I know they founda suspect's fingerprint.

357
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,200
But ey couldn't finda match.

358
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,000
I did.

359
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,200
He was hurting my girls, and I was the one who hiredhim to tend the grounds.

360
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,100
I didn't realize.

361
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,400
Did he hurt nadia?

362
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,500
He tried.

363
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,800
I didn't give himthe second chance

364
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,100
I know what I didwas wrong, but they were my children.

365
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,100
Yeah.

366
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,100
I would have donethe same thing. 

367
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,400
Still, that doesn'tanswer my question.

368
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,600
All I ever wanted was to protect nadia.

369
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,200
When she was brought to meas a baby, she was in danger.

370
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,300
I changed her last nameto santos so nobody could find her.

371
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,200
The men who attacked mein lisbon -- 

372
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,100
they weren't after me.

373
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,400
They werafter nadia.

374
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:59,300
They wanted to knowwhat name I had given her.

375
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,700
And what did you tell them?

376
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,100
Nothing.

377
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
Why didn't you tell nadia?

378
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,700
When I saw her with her sister,with you... 

379
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:20,500
she deserves the happinessshe's found here.

380
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,800
I couldn't bring backall that pain to her life.

381
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,300
Don't worry.

382
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,400
Now I can take care of her.

383
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
How can you be sure?

384
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,500
 Because I knowwho's after my child.

385
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,200
you wantedto show me something?

386
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:48,700
Oh, yeah.

387
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,300
Hey, syd.

388
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Yeah, check this out.

389
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,800
Now this is one nanogramof hydrosec, which isone billionth of a gram in a 500 milliliterbeaker of water.

390
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:01,400
Accordingto my simulation, the toxin actually feedsoff the water.

391
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,400
One gram of hydrosec,lake michigan turns into sludge.

392
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,500
It's incredible, really,you know...

393
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,100
you know, dr.

394
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,000
Evilsort of way.

395
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:15,400
What would it taketo manufacture this stuff, level 4 biohazard containment?

396
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,100
Yeah, and a massivecooling system, which should narrow downthe possible locations.

397
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,200
Give me a couple hours.

398
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,300
What's this?

399
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:24,900
Huh?

400
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:33,800
Uh... you know, it's just a copyof some research I'm doing for -- ahem --mr. Sloane.

401
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,600
It's not -- damn it.

402
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,200
What the hellare you thinking?

403
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,300
I'm sure you mean thatin the most polite way.

404
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,900
Using cia resourcesto check up on sophia.

405
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,400
I was merely being cautious.

406
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,900
I don't understand this, but nadia believes in you.

407
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,600
omehow you've earnedher trust.

408
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,900
Every time you lie to her,you break that bond.

409
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,700
I want you to understandthat I'm not telling you thisout of concern for you.

410
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
Only my sister.

411
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,700
Take the highwayto the end of the night

412
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,900
end of the night 

413
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,000
end of the night

414
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,400
nobody reads the paperanymore.

415
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,200
There is too much tragedyin the world.

416
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,400
End of the night 

417
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,300
realms of bliss 

418
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,800
realms of light...

419
00:25:59,500 --> 00:25:59,800
clean.

420
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,700
Have a seat.

421
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,900
Your reputation proceeds y,mr. Halsey.

422
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,500
You're too kind.

423
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Temperamental.

424
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,300
Arrogant.

425
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,200
Vindictive.

426
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:20,900
Violent.

427
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,300
Vain.

428
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,500
Petty and deceitful.

429
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,000
You're forgettingtalented...

430
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,600
brilliant...

431
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,000
and easy on the eye.

432
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,400
There is that.

433
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,800
You are supposedto be brilliant.

434
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,000
They say you'rethe best hacker in the E.U.

435
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,800
That's the rep.

436
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:44,800
T what went wrongon the kroner job?

437
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,700
Kroner job --what happened?

438
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:47,500
Petty?

439
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,900
Who the hell's thatson of a bitch to call me petty?

440
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,600
You know what?

441
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,000
ou can all go -- aah!

442
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,500
Nothing went wrong.

443
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,800
Then why does kronerhate you so much, hmm?

444
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,800
I finished the jobas agreed. 

445
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,100
Perfectly, I may add.

446
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,600
Aah!

447
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,000
Listen to me,you son of a bitch.

448
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm not gonna let youhang my partner out to dry.

449
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,600
The son of a bitchshorted me 10 grand

450
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,400
 Kroner stiffed him10,000 euros.

451
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,300
Then kroner turned around, forgot to pay memy 10,000 euros.

452
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,700
That doesn't explainwhy he hates you.

453
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,900
Now by my count, you stillhave three rings left. 

454
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,500
That's on one ear.

455
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,200
What happened?

456
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,200
After he stiffed me..

457
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,200
He hacked kroner'scredit card to buy hookers.

458
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:45,400
I hacked into hiscredit card account, chard itexactly 10,000 euros to several young ladiesin the red light district,

459
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,200
and then sent the billsto his wife.

460
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,700
Yes, I did.

461
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,200
We leave in an hour.

462
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,400
Aleksander, tell the teamto meet us at tuege airfield.

463
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,400
You wanted to see me?

464
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,800
I was thinking...

465
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,600
the embassy transmissionthat kradic intercepted -- 

466
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:37,400
the network tap he installedwould have had to have been physically placedon the premises.

467
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,400
I don't follow.

468
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:44,000
It would be too riskyto send someone to retrieve it afterwards,so we can assume it stores the information.

469
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:49,400
Which means we might be ableto access it remotely as well and download the same intelkradic got off it.

470
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,800
This is all assumingthe indonesians haven't already locatedand removed the tap.

471
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,600
It's worth a shot.

472
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
I'll get marshall right on it. 

473
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:40,700
Went into the development of this little marvel,and you yank it out with a letter opener?

474
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,500
What are youtalking about?

475
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,500
You don't havethe faintest --

476
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,300
I implanted it to regulate the medicationin your bloodstream.

477
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,100
I explained the entireprocedure to you.

478
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,700
You did?

479
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,000
I did.

480
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,500
I have no memory of this.

481
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,200
Well, we talked aboutthe fact that memory loss could be a side effect.

482
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,100
I even implanteda second one in your calf.

483
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,500
You don't remember that,either, do you?

484
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,000
My position... 

485
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:26,000
my job -- this side effectis unacceptable.

486
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,500
I can adjust the medication.

487
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,400
But your conditionis progressing quicker than I hadanticipated.

488
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,500
Jack, have you thought any moreabout what we discussed?

489
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,300
About sydney?

490
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,600
Sydney has had to faceso many things in her life.

491
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,600
Too manyfor someone so young.

492
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,400
And now, given my condition,I don't want to burden her.

493
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,400
 It's not fair.

494
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,500
Honesty -- that's fair.

495
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,800
You won'always be aroundto protect her, jack.

496
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
She has to know the truthbefore it's too late.

497
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,100
You disagreewith my decision? 

498
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,200
The embassy?

499
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,300
I wasn't there.

500
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,100
I was boxed in

501
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,900
So I made a ll.

502
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,500
Did some civilians die?

503
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,600
Yes

504
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,500
Would I do it again?

505
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,300
Absolutely.

506
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,500
There are sacrificeswe have to make.

507
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,400
There are casualtiesin the business that we're in.

508
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,300
 You disappoint me, marcus.

509
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,500
There was a timeyou understood that.

510
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,400
That was a long time ago.

511
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,300
Things are...

512
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,800
different.

513
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,000
What happened,you get religion?

514
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,100
I had that.

515
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,100
No, I got married.

516
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,500
Had kids.

517
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,700
Changes a man.

518
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,400
You mean it softens

519
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,100
I mean it deepens,gives a man perspective.

520
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,500
Maybe we need menwho can make the hard call, weigh the manyagainst the few.

521
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:17,100
I just know that every timeI think of those 15 people at the embassy,

522
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,800
it weighs on me.

523
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:31,600
How many kids you got?

524
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,500
A daughter, robin,and a son, steven.

525
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,100
And the lucky lady?

526
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,900
My wife was killeda few years ago

527
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,300
What you would call a casualtyof the business we're in. 

528
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,300
Make sure the plane'sready to go.

529
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,600
Ooh, hope it's warmwhere we're going, 'cause this weather'skilling me.

530
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,600
We are 15 minutesbehind schedule.

531
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,200
We'll have to make it upin the air.

532
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Vaughn just checked in.

533
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,300
Kradic's men just arrivedat tuege airfield. 

534
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,800
Marshall was able to runa network probe at the indonesian embassy.

535
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,100
It turns outmy father was right.

536
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,600
We've got a sourceon the hydrosec.

537
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,200
It'sn a manufacturing plantin peru.

538
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,900
Unfortunately,kradic beat us to it.

539
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,200
He must have had a teamin place.

540
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,300
Four hours ago there was a firein one of the research labs.

541
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,000
Our theory is that kradic'smen caused the accident to steal the hydrosec.

542
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,100
It fits their M.O.

543
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,400
Using disaster to achievetheir operational objectives.

544
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,800
Well, the big question is,since they have it, where do they planto use it? 

545
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,700
It's most likely that kradicwill set up a rendezvous with the heist team.

546
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,100
Our best course of actionwould still be to keep dixon in play.

547
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:13,600
That's it.

548
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,700
Something else, jack? 

549
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,800
I know we agreed to keep thisbetween ourselves, but the time has arrived.

550
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:32,700
Personal considerations havebeen weighing on me, arvin.

551
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,300
We need to tell themthe truth. 

552
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,300
 Yes, I know.

553
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,400
You're right.

554
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,900
I'm afraid that nadia'salready in danger.

555
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,200
Fully fueled and readyto take us over the border.

556
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,300
Get the gear.

557
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,100
Let's move.

558
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,100
I'm in place.

559
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:08,800
Do you read?

560
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:09,700
Go ahead.

561
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:16,700
Kradic has gathereda total of six team members, and they're en routeto the plane.

562
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,300
And agent dixon is still embedded?

563
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,000
Securely.

564
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:32,300
Hey!

565
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,000
What's going on? 

566
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,700
Outrigger,I'm in position.

567
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,600
I have a better question.

568
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,200
Which one of you twois agent dixon? 

569
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,400
What?

570
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,400
Oh, man,you're out of your mind.

571
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,200
Milos, come on.Put the gun down.

572
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,000
Take it easy.

573
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:53,600
Enough!

574
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Aleksander intercepteda transmission.

575
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,700
Transmission?

576
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,200
What are you talking about?

577
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,500
You're just being paranoid.

578
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,200
I knowone of you is an agent.

579
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,200
If I move any closer, I'll bemade

580
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,700
Do you have a weapon?

581
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:04,200
Milos, come on.

582
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,200
 Let's talkthis thing through.

583
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:05,700
Come on. 

584
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,900
We are not doing anythingtill I find out the truth!

585
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,000
I sensed somethingwas wrong about you. 

586
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,600
No, no, no.

587
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,300
You wrong!

588
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,500
You know my reputation.

589
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:16,600
You checked out the kroner job. 

590
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,800
I should have trustedmy instincts.

591
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,200
Now, see, this is insane.

592
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
I'm not an agent!

593
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,700
Take it easy.

594
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Who do you work for?

595
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:25,500
Cia?

596
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:26,200
Mossad?

597
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,400
Man, what you talking about? 

598
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,700
Milos, nobody here is an agent.

599
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,500
Okay.

600
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,400
Then you leave melittle choice, huh?

601
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,600
 I'll have to killboth of you.

602
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,500
Which one of you would liketo die first?

603
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,700
Nobody's got to die.

604
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,600
We're all on the same side here. 

605
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,100
Everybody just needs tocalm down.

606
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,100
Lower your guns.

607
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,800
Okay.

608
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,200
Kill both of them.

609
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:07,900
Enough!

610
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,900
Outrigger,don't shoot kradic!

611
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,400
We need him to lead usto the hydrosec.

612
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,400
Let me finish this.

613
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,800
Get on your knees.

614
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,600
This is how you dealwith traitors.

615
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,400
What you got to say now,agent dixon? 

616
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,100
So, dixon, any last words?

617
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,000
Hey...

618
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:48,000
casualty of the businessI'm in. 

619
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,900
He's giving usan out.

620
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,700
He's sacrificing himselfto save the mission.

621
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,500
Shoot him.

622
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:57,200
do it

623
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:10,500
We have business to do, and we needto get out of here before this guy'sbackup shows.

624
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:11,900
You're welcome!

625
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,000
 Let's go.

626
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,400
This is agent vaughn, fieldcode alpha-5-0-niner-charlie.

627
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,600
Request authorizationfor a code 4 medivac.

628
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,400
We have an agent down. 

629
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Vaughn just reported in.

630
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,400
Agent raimes is beingmedivaced to deventer.

631
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,700
He's critical but stable.

632
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,100
They're saying the shot didn'thit any of his vital organs

633
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Dixon saved his life.

634
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,600
He just boarded the plane with kradic and his team.

635
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,300
Re's the tail numberof his flight.

636
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,600
All right, I'll put ina call to euro control, see if we can track it.

637
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:42,900
I think I might be ableto triangulate dixon's signal using one of nsa'scomm sats.

638
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,300
Just --

639
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,600
excuse me, do you havea minute?

640
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,400
What is this about? 

641
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,600
Please, come in.

642
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,100
There's something we needto tell you, something you havethe right to know.

643
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,800
It concerns your mother's sister.

644
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:57,700
Katya? 

645
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,600
Yelena.

646
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,700
She was one of the kgb'sforemost assassins,

647
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,500
responsible for the murdersof countless diplomats and politiciansthroughout eastern europe.

648
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:14,600
In the course of her work,she earned a reputation for being the cruelestof the derevko women.

649
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,900
Why are you telling usthis now? 

650
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,500
Because almost 30 years ago,yelena disappeared.

651
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,700
It was rumored that she hada falling out with irina.

652
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,700
Yelena severed all tiesthe kgb as well as her family.

653
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,100
Both the cia and the kgbtried to find her, but to no avail.

654
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,800
Even irina couldn't locate her.

655
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,700
But you found something? 

656
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:38,200
I received a messagefrom an old associate about a year agothat led me to one of yelena'ssafehouses in warsaw.

657
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,500
Inside we found this.

658
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,500
It's me in college.

659
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,800
This is my old apartmentin argentina.

660
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:51,900
My grad schooltranscripts. 

661
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,400
I was 9 here.

662
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,200
Given what's here,we can assume she's been surveilling you bothfor at least a decade.

663
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,300
We can also assumethat she's responsible for the attack on sophia.

664
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,800
Why?

665
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,200
What does she wantfrom us?

666
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,400
We don't know.

667
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,800
We're doing everythingwe can to find out. 

668
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
What did you learn?

669
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,000
It's me.

670
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,800
The plane is in the air.

671
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,900
Do we know where they're headed?

672
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,900
I'll contact you once I havetheir final destination.

673
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,400
I'll be waiting.

674
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,200
I won't let you down,yelena.

675
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:32,400
Do you have any ideawhere yelena is now? 

676
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,400
At this point,she could be anywhere. --
