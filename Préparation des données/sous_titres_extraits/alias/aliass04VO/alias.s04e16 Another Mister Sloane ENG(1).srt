1
00:00:11,005 --> 00:00:13,737
I know. I know. I know. I'm simply exhausted.

2
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:16,541
The engineers' meeting went over by about 2 1/2 hours,

3
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:18,724
and of course I missed my flight,

4
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:21,246
but luckily I was able to rebook the same day.

5
00:00:21,385 --> 00:00:22,331
Oh, you know what?

6
00:00:22,424 --> 00:00:24,613
Francis called, and, um,

7
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:26,793
they want to publish my paper.

8
00:00:27,887 --> 00:00:29,887
I know. I know.

9
00:00:30,073 --> 00:00:32,216
Well, you know, we'll celebrate when I get home.

10
00:00:32,635 --> 00:00:35,206
You know what? I've got to go, sweetheart.

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:36,626
Tell the girls I have a little something for them.

12
00:00:36,674 --> 00:00:39,149
Give them a kiss. All right, love you, too. Bye.

13
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,496
Excuse me.

14
00:00:59,772 --> 00:01:02,628
Place your luggage and shoes on the table, please.

15
00:01:02,721 --> 00:01:04,096
Oh. Me?

16
00:01:12,334 --> 00:01:13,902
- And your shoes.
- Oh.

17
00:01:24,526 --> 00:01:26,285
Oh, it's just for my daughter.

18
00:01:32,228 --> 00:01:34,371
I will need you to follow me, please.

19
00:01:34,463 --> 00:01:36,271
I don't understand. It's just a bear.

20
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:37,591
This way.

21
00:01:39,088 --> 00:01:42,426
Hang on. Can I have my shoes back, please? Excuse me?

22
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:47,075
What is going on? Am I not allowed to have a toy?

23
00:01:47,916 --> 00:01:49,531
You know, I'd like some answers out of the two of you.

24
00:01:49,624 --> 00:01:50,571
I'm an american citizen.

25
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,227
Don't worry, Dr. Sinclair.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,323
Hang on a second. The other guy looked at my passport. You didn't.

27
00:01:55,461 --> 00:01:58,034
- How did you know my name?
- Your luggage tag.

28
00:01:59,717 --> 00:02:01,525
Oh, this is great. This is just great.

29
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:15,298
Thanks for coming.

30
00:02:15,437 --> 00:02:16,574
On the phone you sounded desperate.

31
00:02:18,052 --> 00:02:20,241
For the past month, I've been investigating leads which --

32
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:21,948
Suggest that your father is still alive.

33
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,034
So? What did you discover?

34
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:27,531
What I learned is that it was a hoax.

35
00:02:27,624 --> 00:02:30,339
My father was killed by Irina Derevko in 1979.

36
00:02:30,524 --> 00:02:33,096
But someone was trying to make me believe otherwise.

37
00:02:34,358 --> 00:02:38,362
Any idea who may have perpetrated this elaborate conspiracy?

38
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:40,488
Arvin Sloane.

39
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,055
One of his colleagues confessed.

40
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,873
What possible motive would he have --

41
00:02:47,966 --> 00:02:49,772
To force me into stealing something they wanted.

42
00:02:49,865 --> 00:02:52,914
I mean, come on, Jack, do I really have to explain to you what this is about?

43
00:02:53,008 --> 00:02:54,382
Sloane hasn't reformed.

44
00:02:54,662 --> 00:02:56,756
And he's still after the same things.

45
00:02:56,849 --> 00:02:58,081
There's more, dad.

46
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:01,733
Vaughn wasn't the only person deceived by Sloane.

47
00:03:02,292 --> 00:03:05,390
The contract, the hit that was put on my life --

48
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:07,612
I've seen the bank records.

49
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,179
The payments paid to the assassin.

50
00:03:10,598 --> 00:03:11,879
It wasn't mom.

51
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:14,094
It was Sloane.

52
00:03:15,075 --> 00:03:17,934
He was behind it. He wanted you to kill her.

53
00:03:22,362 --> 00:03:23,451
I'm sorry, dad.

54
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,292
We should notify the agency. Chase --

55
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:28,809
No.

56
00:03:32,507 --> 00:03:34,408
I'll handle everything.

57
00:03:47,842 --> 00:03:49,217
What do you want?

58
00:03:51,603 --> 00:03:53,315
Just tell me what you want.

59
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,319
Welcome, professor Sinclair.

60
00:04:20,864 --> 00:04:22,096
What's this about, Jack?

61
00:04:24,997 --> 00:04:26,898
You can't imagine

62
00:04:26,992 --> 00:04:28,320
what it felt like

63
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:32,825
looking into the face of the woman I once shared a life with,

64
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:35,011
and with a single bullet

65
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:38,735
ending that life.

66
00:04:39,858 --> 00:04:42,430
I ran through every scenario. Why?

67
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:45,205
What was the purpose in having me believe

68
00:04:45,297 --> 00:04:49,684
the only way to save my daughter's life was to kill her mother?

69
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,681
And then it occurred to me

70
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,356
why you would go to such lengths.

71
00:04:57,682 --> 00:04:58,771
It was for Sydney.

72
00:04:59,707 --> 00:05:01,991
You imagined you'd drive a wedge

73
00:05:02,224 --> 00:05:03,698
between me and my daughter.

74
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,024
I didn't.

75
00:05:05,256 --> 00:05:07,495
I had nothing to do with Irina's death.

76
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:18,363
One good reason why I shouldn't do to you what I did to my wife.

77
00:05:22,576 --> 00:05:23,377
Jack,

78
00:05:24,265 --> 00:05:25,356
this doesn't make sense.

79
00:05:26,804 --> 00:05:27,655
Think about it.

80
00:05:29,948 --> 00:05:33,094
Even if I did succeed in undermining your relationship with Sydney --

81
00:05:33,188 --> 00:05:34,897
which, given our agreement,

82
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,035
runs counter to my self-interest --

83
00:05:37,315 --> 00:05:41,321
even then, with all the people in Sydney's life --

84
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:45,218
Vaughn, Nadia, anyone --

85
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:48,776
do you really believe that she would turn to me?

86
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:52,586
Jack, I didn't do this.

87
00:05:56,283 --> 00:05:57,899
Someone is setting me up.

88
00:06:03,283 --> 00:06:04,180
Who are you?

89
00:06:07,038 --> 00:06:10,706
Your questions will all be answered in time.

90
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,369
It's...

91
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:16,816
what I have,

92
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:21,254
what we can do together, that matters.

93
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:32,713
Years ago, I was with the army corps of engineers.

94
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:36,427
They wanted me to study a certain manuscript.

95
00:06:37,784 --> 00:06:42,650
These pages were drawn over 500 years ago

96
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:44,725
by a man of genius

97
00:06:46,579 --> 00:06:49,531
who anticipated scientific principles

98
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:52,846
centuries ahead of his time.

99
00:06:56,804 --> 00:06:59,664
- You're insane.
- Not at all.

100
00:07:01,021 --> 00:07:03,065
Prototypes of his designs

101
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:05,898
have already been built.

102
00:07:06,271 --> 00:07:07,888
Turned up all over the world.

103
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:12,555
I've been collecting them for the past 35 years.

104
00:07:13,444 --> 00:07:15,107
I  don't understand. What do I have --

105
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,831
I've been following your career, Dr. Sinclair, since Stanford.

106
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,905
I  need your expertise.

107
00:07:29,987 --> 00:07:33,851
You want me to build a 500-year-old machine?

108
00:07:41,572 --> 00:07:42,663
Okay.

109
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:45,264
Listen to me.

110
00:07:47,135 --> 00:07:49,420
I know that, um...

111
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,774
we all have beliefs,

112
00:07:52,914 --> 00:07:57,494
and things that we really want and wish to be true and real.

113
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,049
But these specs -- they're just theoretical.

114
00:08:02,096 --> 00:08:04,811
They have absolutely no basis in physical reality.

115
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,732
Once you see...

116
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:12,997
once you believe...

117
00:08:18,005 --> 00:08:20,290
it'll change everything for you.

118
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:24,781
And what if I don't cooperate?

119
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:50,845
You will.

120
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:37,292
You believe Sloane?

121
00:09:37,384 --> 00:09:38,521
Until proven otherwise, yes.

122
00:09:38,613 --> 00:09:40,515
Until proven otherwise? Didn't you hear what I said?

123
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:41,982
What the hell did Sloane say to you?

124
00:09:42,074 --> 00:09:44,454
Actually, agent Vaughn, in this country the burden of proof

125
00:09:44,548 --> 00:09:47,167
is on establishing guilt, not innocence.

126
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,781
Roberts -- he's in custody.

127
00:09:50,107 --> 00:09:52,104
He said that Sloane was behind the attacks,

128
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:53,624
that he worked for Sloane.

129
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:54,691
You want to put them together?

130
00:09:54,783 --> 00:09:57,450
Assume he makes a positive I.D. you put him face to face with Sloane.

131
00:09:57,544 --> 00:09:58,634
Watch him try to deny that.

132
00:09:58,725 --> 00:09:59,814
You'll have your proof.

133
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:09,752
Roberts, the man you're about to see is your former employer, Arvin Sloane.

134
00:10:09,845 --> 00:10:12,272
All we need you to do is make a positive I.D.

135
00:10:15,408 --> 00:10:17,215
- Well?
- Huh.

136
00:10:17,803 --> 00:10:18,750
What does that mean?

137
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:21,845
I mean, that dude is him -- sort of.

138
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:22,932
Is it him or not?

139
00:10:23,072 --> 00:10:25,308
I mean, yeah, it's him, but then it's not.

140
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:26,155
Know what I'm saying?

141
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:29,202
- So it's not him, but --
- But almost him.

142
00:10:29,434 --> 00:10:30,189
This is wild.

143
00:10:30,283 --> 00:10:32,471
Like, they don't even look that much alike, but...

144
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,306
Oh, this is freaky, man.

145
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:40,489
You ask me, both of them give me the creeps.

146
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,896
Now that I've been exonerated by your informant,

147
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:45,229
I suggest you find out what it is he really does know.

148
00:10:45,324 --> 00:10:46,939
I'll be in my office.

149
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:50,348
I believe it's still mine, yes?

150
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:55,434
Just because Roberts didn't make a positive I.D.

151
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,953
doesn't  mean Sloane's not involved.

152
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,310
Is there a problem?

153
00:11:05,638 --> 00:11:07,444
Yes, actually, there is.

154
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:10,982
You're missing a vital component.

155
00:11:12,337 --> 00:11:13,284
Am I?

156
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:15,260
A transformer coil.

157
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:22,044
Which acts as a containment stabilizer.

158
00:11:22,511 --> 00:11:24,031
Yes, that's right.

159
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:27,940
Yes, we were hoping to have obtained the coil by now.

160
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,355
Well, then you know that without it,

161
00:11:30,447 --> 00:11:35,314
a device of this size is incapable of withstanding its own power output.

162
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:36,490
Hmm.

163
00:11:54,372 --> 00:12:00,531
Maggie, I hired you because countless times you've proven yourself capable

164
00:12:00,717 --> 00:12:06,060
of improvising solutions where others have failed.

165
00:12:09,196 --> 00:12:12,292
Well, I thank you for your vote of confidence,

166
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:14,719
but even I have my limits.

167
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:17,819
I see.

168
00:12:28,863 --> 00:12:29,857
Motivate her.

169
00:12:40,246 --> 00:12:41,574
I want to believe you,

170
00:12:41,715 --> 00:12:43,521
but it doesn't make any sense --

171
00:12:44,205 --> 00:12:45,868
Why someone would set you up,

172
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:49,247
pursue the same specific things you've pursued in the past.

173
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,713
So you think that I've resumed my search for Rambaldi.

174
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:54,038
Have you?

175
00:12:54,365 --> 00:12:56,028
Nadia, I made you a promise.

176
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:59,491
I gave up my past obsessions for you.

177
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:08,334
Look, I know I've given you reasons to doubt me.

178
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,340
I know I've acted crazy in the past,

179
00:13:13,414 --> 00:13:18,235
but what happened in Siena, sweetheart...

180
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,980
that won't happen again.

181
00:13:26,694 --> 00:13:27,879
I promise.

182
00:13:31,156 --> 00:13:35,161
What he's asking might not even be possible even with the component.

183
00:13:37,736 --> 00:13:39,877
Please listen to me. I'm begging you.

184
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:54,610
As you are aware, evidence indicates that someone

185
00:13:54,703 --> 00:13:57,705
has been actively perpetrating crime in my name.

186
00:13:58,264 --> 00:14:01,792
Objective is simple -- find the man. Apprehend him.

187
00:14:01,884 --> 00:14:03,356
Assuming he exists at all.

188
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,493
That's the assumption we're working with.

189
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:08,349
Our best lead so far is Roberts. Where are we with him?

190
00:14:08,442 --> 00:14:10,104
Roberts has been interrogated.

191
00:14:10,197 --> 00:14:13,294
His knowledge of the organization he was working for is extremely limited.

192
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:16,341
But we can still use him. He knows their contact protocol.

193
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,099
We give Roberts the coil and put him into play.

194
00:14:19,238 --> 00:14:20,279
He makes an exchange.

195
00:14:20,373 --> 00:14:22,994
We track the coil back to Arvin Clone.

196
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,731
Sorry, that's what we've been calling him.

197
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:29,207
Yeah, also, uh, Marvin Sloane. Rolling Sloanes.

198
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:32,301
But obviously equally disrespectful.

199
00:14:32,394 --> 00:14:34,056
Has Roberts agreed to cooperate?

200
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:36,576
I'm sure we can persuade him to see things our way.

201
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:37,851
Um, excuse me, sorry,

202
00:14:37,944 --> 00:14:41,854
but we all know that the coil is a key component in the Rambaldi design.

203
00:14:42,604 --> 00:14:43,644
Rambaldi.

204
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:47,548
Which means that, per your pardon agreement, Mr. Sloane,

205
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:50,023
you must recuse yourself of all matters Rambaldi.

206
00:14:50,116 --> 00:14:51,683
You have to leave this room.

207
00:14:51,777 --> 00:14:54,923
Marshall, this mission is about proving my innocence.

208
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:57,586
Sydney, Marcus, talk to Roberts.

209
00:14:57,707 --> 00:15:01,908
Help him to see that it's in his best interest to work with us right away.

210
00:15:03,128 --> 00:15:05,421
You except me to double-cross Sloane?

211
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:07,799
- He's not Sloane.
- Whoever he is.

212
00:15:08,030 --> 00:15:11,415
You dangle bait in front of a man like that, you lose a hand.

213
00:15:13,052 --> 00:15:15,624
I'm sorry, but, uh, no can do.

214
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:17,507
Let's be clear.

215
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,549
You play ball with us, or enjoy the rest of your life in prison.

216
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:22,257
I'll be safer in prison. Trust.

217
00:15:22,584 --> 00:15:25,042
We guarantee immunity from prosecution.

218
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:27,851
National security crimes, europol records, parking tickets --

219
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:29,224
you name it, it all disappears.

220
00:15:29,364 --> 00:15:31,600
And we relocate you to someplace safe.

221
00:15:33,751 --> 00:15:35,032
Someplace safe?

222
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:37,768
What, like Mars?

223
00:15:38,049 --> 00:15:41,528
You'll have full CIA protection. You have our word.

224
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:47,274
Look, I met the man twice.

225
00:15:48,819 --> 00:15:51,561
I deal with his number two. Cat named Carter.

226
00:15:51,657 --> 00:15:54,848
You think about running a trace, they'll know.

227
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:56,124
The line's clean.

228
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:03,709
Please, no! No, please, no!

229
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:08,377
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

230
00:16:13,057 --> 00:16:15,037
- I'm hanging up.
- No, no, let it ring.

231
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,363
What do you want me to do, leave a message?

232
00:16:16,457 --> 00:16:17,975
We won't get a chance like this again.

233
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:32,466
- It's Roberts.
- Where have you been?

234
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,203
Well, hello to you, too, Carter.

235
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,575
It's not nice to disappear, Mr. Roberts.

236
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:39,192
Yeah, well, um, things got a little hot,

237
00:16:39,285 --> 00:16:40,901
so I had to lay low for a whole.

238
00:16:40,993 --> 00:16:42,130
Lay low.

239
00:16:42,222 --> 00:16:45,511
A thing lays, as in you lay a book down.

240
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:47,401
A person lies.

241
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,727
Oh, okay.

242
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:51,522
Well, uh, listen. Why don't we get together?

243
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:53,068
You can give me some grammar lessons,

244
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:55,397
and I can give you that coil you've been looking for.

245
00:16:55,677 --> 00:16:56,767
You have the coil?

246
00:16:58,124 --> 00:16:59,691
I'm looking right at it.

247
00:16:59,782 --> 00:17:02,737
But considering the considerable risk I've taken to procure it,

248
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:04,105
the price just went up.

249
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:06,426
-  Name it.
- 750.

250
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:08,840
Plus a neutral place to meet.

251
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:11,501
Plus, no more grammar lessons.

252
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:14,584
- A neutral location?
- Yeah, that's right.

253
00:17:14,724 --> 00:17:18,298
Or I disappear again, and I take your slinky with me.

254
00:17:18,391 --> 00:17:21,394
You call back in a half hour. I'll have a location.

255
00:17:24,952 --> 00:17:26,232
Might not seem it,

256
00:17:27,403 --> 00:17:29,544
but this could be the luckiest day of your life.

257
00:17:33,287 --> 00:17:35,571
You people better have my back.

258
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:41,397
- The meet is on.
- Where?

259
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:44,154
Tomorrow. Around the corner. 1500.

260
00:17:47,008 --> 00:17:48,480
47...

261
00:17:52,973 --> 00:17:54,300
45...

262
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,682
He's innocent.

263
00:17:58,617 --> 00:17:59,754
Maybe.

264
00:17:59,987 --> 00:18:01,412
I know it, Sydney.

265
00:18:03,097 --> 00:18:04,377
I hope you're right.

266
00:18:06,483 --> 00:18:07,572
Do you?

267
00:18:10,267 --> 00:18:11,816
Okay, one more patch, ladies,

268
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,336
and I am tied into the hotel surveillance system.

269
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:17,996
Perfecto.

270
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:19,893
Qué bueno, Nadia y Sydney.

271
00:18:20,033 --> 00:18:21,792
All systems up and running. Ready to rock.

272
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,455
Moving into position.

273
00:18:25,549 --> 00:18:27,977
Copy, Dixon. We have you on screen.

274
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:33,822
Oh, this place is killer. We have to get married here.

275
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,863
You haven't even proposed yet.

276
00:18:36,004 --> 00:18:37,044
They don't know that.

277
00:18:37,138 --> 00:18:38,180
We can tell them that we're thinking about it

278
00:18:38,272 --> 00:18:40,365
and get a free meal off the sampler menu.

279
00:18:50,895 --> 00:18:52,463
Excuse me, sir, do you have the time, please?

280
00:18:52,556 --> 00:18:54,125
Time for me to get the hell out of here.

281
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,405
Just look at your watch and tell me what time it is.

282
00:18:57,949 --> 00:18:58,895
2:55.

283
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:01,560
When Carter arrives, we'll move in and arrest him.

284
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:02,933
You have nothing to worry about.

285
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,070
Clearly, you don't know the man.

286
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:13,485
Yo. Rum cannonball.

287
00:19:13,718 --> 00:19:15,668
A little early for the hard stuff,

288
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,077
don't you think?

289
00:19:18,918 --> 00:19:20,181
No, I don't.

290
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:22,935
In fact, make it two. One for each hand.

291
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,152
We have an approach.

292
00:19:37,369 --> 00:19:38,793
Do I know you?

293
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,047
I'm just here to make the sweep.

294
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:43,703
Make  sure you're not carrying any weapons.

295
00:19:47,401 --> 00:19:49,447
Sit tight, Sydney. See where this goes.

296
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,792
- Okay. Come with me.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

297
00:19:55,837 --> 00:19:56,927
The plan was to meet here.

298
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:59,401
The plan's changed. We're doing this in the penthouse.

299
00:20:00,335 --> 00:20:01,521
Show me.

300
00:20:12,662 --> 00:20:14,756
All teams, re-deploy to cover the penthouse.

301
00:20:14,803 --> 00:20:16,036
Moving to the freight elevator.

302
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:21,778
Sydney, we need audio on Roberts.

303
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:22,939
Copy.

304
00:20:25,608 --> 00:20:28,657
You got stones, man. Double-crossing Carter like that?

305
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:31,696
Sir? Sir, you left this at the bar.

306
00:20:33,146 --> 00:20:34,331
T hanks.

307
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:36,721
Oh!

308
00:20:38,293 --> 00:20:41,055
So, did Carter come himself, or did he send somebody?

309
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:44,629
Oh, no, no, no. He wants to do this face to face.

310
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:52,187
Following them up.

311
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:25,059
Something's wrong. He's here. The clone.

312
00:21:25,152 --> 00:21:26,767
They're gonna cut the cable.

313
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:51,319
On my way to the subbasement now.

314
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,638
Roberts is dead.

315
00:22:31,245 --> 00:22:33,151
And the coil is gone.

316
00:22:42,542 --> 00:22:44,060
I need to speak with you.

317
00:22:46,352 --> 00:22:48,636
I saw him at the hotel.

318
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:51,829
It was only for a moment, but I know now what Roberts was talking about.

319
00:22:51,921 --> 00:22:53,680
The man, the impostor --

320
00:22:54,334 --> 00:22:56,043
everything about him, Sloane.

321
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:57,560
His clothe his posture,

322
00:22:57,699 --> 00:23:00,491
they way he looked at me -- it's the way you look at me.

323
00:23:01,968 --> 00:23:03,297
And how is that, Sydney?

324
00:23:04,511 --> 00:23:06,939
Let's just say it's equally disturbing.

325
00:23:07,032 --> 00:23:07,691
Yeah.

326
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:11,025
Well, quite frankly, I'm surprised that you didn't get to it before.

327
00:23:11,586 --> 00:23:12,484
What's that?

328
00:23:12,576 --> 00:23:15,674
You read the report. The operation, the elevator cables.

329
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:19,037
- Moscow. Four years ago.
- Yeah.

330
00:23:19,691 --> 00:23:22,262
I tasked Julian Sark to a similar strategy

331
00:23:22,307 --> 00:23:26,026
in order to relieve a Mr. Karpachev of a certain item I required.

332
00:23:26,119 --> 00:23:27,782
Why would someone be impersonating you?

333
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,489
It appears to be more than that.

334
00:23:29,863 --> 00:23:33,246
This man -- his strategy, his appearance,

335
00:23:33,293 --> 00:23:36,722
his affinity for all things Rambaldi.

336
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:40,085
You think he actually believes he's you?

337
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,400
Oh... perhaps Marshall was right.

338
00:23:45,662 --> 00:23:49,046
Perhaps I should recuse myself from any further involvement.

339
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:50,611
No, you have to stay in it.

340
00:23:51,312 --> 00:23:53,453
In fact, you may need to go deeper.

341
00:23:53,874 --> 00:23:56,589
The coils, the manuscript, your sense of strategy.

342
00:23:56,636 --> 00:23:58,441
If you're right about this, he has access to everything --

343
00:23:58,675 --> 00:24:01,821
CIA files, your psych reports, mission analysis.

344
00:24:02,709 --> 00:24:06,572
You may be the only one who can do it -- anticipate his next move.

345
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,089
You're asking me to go back to Rambaldi?

346
00:24:18,037 --> 00:24:19,318
God help us.

347
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:21,850
Yes.

348
00:24:48,952 --> 00:24:50,661
Identity confirmed.

349
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,940
I was wrong about your father. I'm sorry.

350
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:06,128
I know it's been hard to work with Sloane, to trust him.

351
00:26:06,221 --> 00:26:07,118
That's no excuse.

352
00:26:07,211 --> 00:26:08,970
No. You're doing your job.

353
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,391
You don't have to apologize.

354
00:26:10,483 --> 00:26:12,049
Thanks for saying that, but

355
00:26:12,170 --> 00:26:16,653
asking him to go back to the thing that was the cause of so many problems...

356
00:26:17,355 --> 00:26:18,539
What do you mean?

357
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:22,430
Chase authorized my request to research Rambaldi --

358
00:26:22,477 --> 00:26:23,422
Are you serious?

359
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:25,130
He's in there with Dixon right now.

360
00:26:25,222 --> 00:26:26,073
Sydney...

361
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,451
- What is it? I thought --
- You don't know what I saw.

362
00:26:29,479 --> 00:26:32,433
Last year when my father and I went back to Siena,

363
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:35,192
the closer we got to finding this artifact that he wanted,

364
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:36,901
the more he began to change.

365
00:26:37,368 --> 00:26:39,892
I saw him slipping away from himself.

366
00:26:40,547 --> 00:26:44,312
His passion, this desperation to connect with Rambaldi,

367
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:46,164
it completely overtook him.

368
00:26:47,146 --> 00:26:48,857
He became a different man.

369
00:26:49,324 --> 00:26:52,088
His eyes were mad, lost.

370
00:26:53,398 --> 00:26:55,204
I didn't want to be around him after that.

371
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,679
The only reason I agreed to come back, to join A.P.O.,

372
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:04,111
it was because he promised me that part of his life was over.

373
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:30,294
I know what he's doing.

374
00:27:33,992 --> 00:27:35,798
I know what he's doing.

375
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:43,014
The man we're looking for is attempting to construct an energy source --

376
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:46,394
in essence, a massive battery is the simplest way to describe it.

377
00:27:46,488 --> 00:27:48,008
- Where's the power?
- We don't know.

378
00:27:48,381 --> 00:27:50,092
So that's why he needed the transformer coil.

379
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:51,940
That's right, but in order to use it,

380
00:27:52,032 --> 00:27:54,938
it's necessary to have an engineer with a specialty in nuclear physics.

381
00:27:55,714 --> 00:27:58,524
An advanced knowledge of quantum electrodynamics.

382
00:27:58,664 --> 00:28:00,757
There are only a handful of scientists in the world.

383
00:28:00,895 --> 00:28:02,509
You think one of them is working with our target?

384
00:28:02,677 --> 00:28:04,770
Yes, but not by choice.

385
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:07,338
Dr. Margaret Sinclair disappeared last week in Krakow.

386
00:28:07,430 --> 00:28:09,571
We can presume this is no coincidence.

387
00:28:09,711 --> 00:28:11,835
Could this battery already be completed?

388
00:28:12,535 --> 00:28:13,386
It's unlikely.

389
00:28:13,805 --> 00:28:17,716
There are other important components, including xanthium 242.

390
00:28:18,417 --> 00:28:20,509
How do we know they don't already have it?

391
00:28:20,837 --> 00:28:23,265
I contacted a former colleague of mine in Sicily.

392
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:26,298
Someone who trades in illicit chemicals.

393
00:28:26,625 --> 00:28:31,585
Apparently yesterday morning Arvin Sloane placed an order

394
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:34,059
for an unprecedented amount of xanthium.

395
00:28:34,151 --> 00:28:36,100
I kindly told him to hold the order.

396
00:28:37,082 --> 00:28:40,467
That I would be picking it up personally.

397
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:43,969
- Someone else can do this.
- No, it's my contact.

398
00:28:44,061 --> 00:28:45,821
Then you should have backup. I'll come with you.

399
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:48,759
Nadia, it's a meeting. I don't need backup.

400
00:28:51,707 --> 00:28:52,941
Look, sweetheart,

401
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:55,962
I know what you're concerned about.

402
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:57,659
Rambaldi.

403
00:28:58,641 --> 00:29:00,639
You have nothing to worry about. I'll be fine.

404
00:29:00,731 --> 00:29:02,443
I think you're asking too much of yourself.

405
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:05,488
Look, I've proven myself to you, to everyone. I don't have to --

406
00:29:05,583 --> 00:29:07,198
The DSR was a contained environment.

407
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:08,857
You were being watched. There were limitations.

408
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,240
The only limitation that was necessary when I was at the DSR is you.

409
00:29:13,598 --> 00:29:14,926
When I was studying those manuscripts,

410
00:29:15,252 --> 00:29:17,777
the only thing my thoughts kept returning to was you.

411
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:22,568
I was surrounded by symbols of all the things I once believed in,

412
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:23,991
and it all felt meaningless.

413
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:29,053
Having a daughter,

414
00:29:29,612 --> 00:29:30,320
knowing you

415
00:29:30,926 --> 00:29:36,866
means more to me than anything ever has or ever will.

416
00:29:38,312 --> 00:29:40,034
What about Siena?

417
00:29:40,409 --> 00:29:43,791
I can't change what you witnessed in Siena.

418
00:29:44,352 --> 00:29:49,456
But I can assure you that the man that you saw there no longer exists.

419
00:29:52,637 --> 00:29:53,965
I'm sorry, Nadia.

420
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:56,508
For what?

421
00:29:58,754 --> 00:30:02,807
Having me as a father is an arduous undertaking, one that I imposed on you.

422
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:03,942
Don't say that.

423
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:09,295
I don't want to lose you again.

424
00:30:11,822 --> 00:30:14,154
Then I need to know that you have faith in me.

425
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:28,705
Considering she doesn't like running on a wet track,

426
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,668
that mare is quite the longshot.

427
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:33,023
Mr. Sloane.

428
00:30:33,209 --> 00:30:36,066
It's been so long -- in person, I mean.

429
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,595
Well, I've had to take some precautions as of late.

430
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:43,070
Do you have the package?

431
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,010
Yes. Of course.

432
00:30:50,438 --> 00:30:54,633
There is a question I've been wanting to ask you for the longest time.

433
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,527
Now that you are here...

434
00:30:59,381 --> 00:31:00,614
Yes? What is it?

435
00:31:01,127 --> 00:31:05,132
This OMNIFAM organization you founded,

436
00:31:05,224 --> 00:31:07,844
feeding the world's poor and hungry --

437
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:11,109
What was that really about?

438
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:15,400
What was in that food you sent to those impoverished countries?

439
00:31:17,223 --> 00:31:18,599
Ignacio.

440
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:22,211
I know you were involved with genetic experimentation.

441
00:31:22,305 --> 00:31:26,213
Ignacio, the fact is that someone in the black market is posing as me.

442
00:31:27,194 --> 00:31:29,144
And that same someone

443
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:33,433
placed all the previous orders of xanthium 242 with you.

444
00:31:33,947 --> 00:31:37,140
Mr. Sloane, he --

445
00:31:37,607 --> 00:31:40,322
he followed all of your protocols.

446
00:31:41,209 --> 00:31:42,346
I didn't know. I swear.

447
00:31:42,439 --> 00:31:44,722
Ignacio, I'm not here to hurt you.

448
00:31:45,938 --> 00:31:48,271
But you need to tell me exactly where

449
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:51,545
that shipment was supposed to be sent.

450
00:31:55,711 --> 00:31:57,326
Marshall, our team's going to Santiago.

451
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,467
Pull up satellite surveillance. 1500 court of Barrera Montin.

452
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,649
Got it. I'm on it.

453
00:32:01,884 --> 00:32:04,693
Weiss, make sure the jet is on standby.

454
00:32:04,786 --> 00:32:07,930
Coordinate an in-country rendezvous with Sloane at 1200 hours.

455
00:32:08,097 --> 00:32:09,855
1200? Jack, it's me. You can say noon.

456
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:11,275
Just do it!

457
00:32:11,648 --> 00:32:13,119
Sloane is joining the tactical team?

458
00:32:13,213 --> 00:32:14,494
Considering who we're up against,

459
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:16,441
and considering our need for Rambaldi information.

460
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:18,579
And are you considering the man himself?

461
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:21,575
It's one thing to allow Sloane into the DSR,

462
00:32:21,714 --> 00:32:24,093
but if his impostor has assembled the Rambaldi device

463
00:32:24,187 --> 00:32:26,471
and Sloane is put in front of it, what assurance do we have --

464
00:32:26,564 --> 00:32:28,561
I'm calling the shots here, Marcus.

465
00:32:29,496 --> 00:32:32,783
And you have a problem with my questioning Sloane's motives?

466
00:32:32,877 --> 00:32:36,785
As far as I'm concerned, at this juncture, Sloane's motives are irrelevant.

467
00:32:37,064 --> 00:32:39,635
If he can help bring the impostor to us, I say

468
00:32:39,729 --> 00:32:42,155
let Sloane do what he needs to do.

469
00:32:43,446 --> 00:32:44,582
Go to Santiago.

470
00:32:45,611 --> 00:32:46,987
Let's end this.

471
00:33:46,176 --> 00:33:48,747
Mr. Sloane, the shipment's here.

472
00:33:49,681 --> 00:33:50,294
Good.

473
00:33:50,948 --> 00:33:52,465
Meet them at the loading dock.

474
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:54,879
See that it's properly handled.

475
00:33:55,814 --> 00:33:58,672
I'll get Dr. Sinclair. We'll meet you at the lab.

476
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,967
Outrigger, do you have visual?

477
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,997
I count seven tangos so far.

478
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:21,600
Still searching for the hostage.

479
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,480
The xanthium has arrived.

480
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:25,659
You can begin assembly immediately.

481
00:34:25,798 --> 00:34:29,135
I could have worked more efficiently if you hadn't ruined my hands.

482
00:34:29,928 --> 00:34:32,212
I have faith that you'll find another way.

483
00:34:33,334 --> 00:34:36,909
I've got a twenty on Dr. Sinclair. Northwest side, level 2.

484
00:34:37,001 --> 00:34:39,046
Hangar's on ground floor, east side.

485
00:34:39,139 --> 00:34:39,989
Understood.

486
00:34:40,082 --> 00:34:40,885
All right, we'll split up.

487
00:34:40,978 --> 00:34:43,214
One team retrieve the hostage, the other secures the lab.

488
00:34:43,728 --> 00:34:44,532
I go with Sloane.

489
00:34:44,578 --> 00:34:45,857
I was gonna suggest that myself.

490
00:35:07,251 --> 00:35:08,818
Strange, isn't it?

491
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:09,905
What's that?

492
00:35:10,371 --> 00:35:12,226
All our years working together,

493
00:35:13,115 --> 00:35:15,207
this is the first time I've been with you in action.

494
00:35:15,673 --> 00:35:17,000
Up close.

495
00:35:19,807 --> 00:35:23,478
Alpha team, you're almost on target. Take the next left.

496
00:35:36,581 --> 00:35:38,051
Watch your fire. They got Sinclair.

497
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:47,787
It's locked.

498
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,874
Stay back, stay back.

499
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:51,975
Give me your radio.

500
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:57,401
Carter, change of plans.

501
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,928
Secure the device from the hangar and meet me by the side exit.

502
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:08,164
What is this?

503
00:36:09,425 --> 00:36:10,371
This is taking too long.

504
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:13,417
If this were your facility, what would the access code be?

505
00:36:16,459 --> 00:36:18,123
J-A...

506
00:36:20,039 --> 00:36:21,703
Try "jacquelyn."

507
00:36:22,543 --> 00:36:25,208
J-A-C-Q-U-E-L-Y-N.

508
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:35,165
Am I supposed to know who that is?

509
00:36:47,287 --> 00:36:49,046
- I'll set the charges.
- No.

510
00:36:50,495 --> 00:36:52,110
No, we don't have to.

511
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:09,869
We can dismantle it.

512
00:37:10,009 --> 00:37:12,675
No. Sloane.

513
00:37:13,282 --> 00:37:15,901
Sydney, we have to consider the value of this.

514
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:18,580
I don't care.

515
00:37:19,047 --> 00:37:21,187
Phoenix, we're cut off. They've got Dr. Sinclair.

516
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:22,983
You've got to intercept them.

517
00:37:23,151 --> 00:37:23,954
Where?

518
00:37:24,094 --> 00:37:25,946
Northwest corridor, headed your way.

519
00:37:26,648 --> 00:37:27,784
Go.

520
00:37:29,936 --> 00:37:31,074
Go.

521
00:37:32,665 --> 00:37:33,515
I'm on it.

522
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:03,759
Mr. Sloane.

523
00:38:05,162 --> 00:38:07,636
I thought we were supposed to rendezvous on the side entrance.

524
00:38:11,286 --> 00:38:12,040
Hello.

525
00:39:07,835 --> 00:39:08,905
Stay with her.

526
00:39:15,316 --> 00:39:16,932
Who's the man misrepresenting me?

527
00:39:18,708 --> 00:39:21,548
- It's Arvin Sloane.
- I'm Arvin Sloane.

528
00:39:24,249 --> 00:39:25,702
Damn!

529
00:39:29,129 --> 00:39:33,087
Do you know what this is that you're doing?

530
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:36,169
What the hell do you want?

531
00:39:36,263 --> 00:39:39,360
Do you understand what you're dealing with here, and for what?

532
00:39:39,499 --> 00:39:41,258
Please, he told me -- Mr. Sloane --

533
00:39:41,304 --> 00:39:42,682
Listen to me.

534
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:45,621
Don't make me tell you again who I am.

535
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,131
You fool.

536
00:39:50,644 --> 00:39:51,542
He told me --

537
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:53,855
he told me that I could live forever.

538
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:54,847
No!

539
00:39:59,293 --> 00:40:02,146
Is that what you think this is all about? Immortality?

540
00:40:02,379 --> 00:40:07,899
You bought the rumor, you simple-minded dilettante!

541
00:40:13,093 --> 00:40:13,991
A mystery.

542
00:40:14,832 --> 00:40:19,649
The true secrets of these creations will always

543
00:40:19,883 --> 00:40:24,221
be held back from you, the unworthy!

544
00:40:39,573 --> 00:40:40,469
Nadia.

545
00:40:49,878 --> 00:40:50,774
It's all over.

546
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:52,845
It's all over, honey.
