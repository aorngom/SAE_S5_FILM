1
00:00:00,288 --> 00:00:01,722
Previously on Alias...

2
00:00:01,723 --> 00:00:03,848
Sydney, this woman is an assassin.

3
00:00:03,849 --> 00:00:05,036
Vaughn trusted her.

4
00:00:05,222 --> 00:00:06,970
They worked together for seven years.

5
00:00:06,971 --> 00:00:10,233
- Sydney's contact is Renée Rienne.
- Really?

6
00:00:10,234 --> 00:00:11,638
Ms. Rienne has been helping Sydney

7
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,950
with her investigation
of the Prophet Five conspiracy.

8
00:00:13,951 --> 00:00:17,438
Michael always told me
I could come to you.

9
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:19,952
Yeah.

10
00:00:20,452 --> 00:00:24,727
These people killed my fiancé,
the father of my child.

11
00:00:25,078 --> 00:00:27,453
Our agreement is whatever I say it is.

12
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:30,889
I'm the one who got you out of prison.
I can easily put you back.

13
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,079
How's your daughter?

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:34,205
Nadia has nothing to do with this.

15
00:00:34,639 --> 00:00:35,826
Oh, sure, she does.

16
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:25,830
I'm at the archive. Your turn now.

17
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:05,686
Got the key.

18
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:09,813
It's transmitting now.
Insert key template.

19
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:13,411
Perfect.

20
00:02:13,852 --> 00:02:15,414
I'm entering the archive.

21
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:27,162
I need the lock number.

22
00:02:27,163 --> 00:02:28,536
So what are we looking for?

23
00:02:28,537 --> 00:02:31,035
All I know is it's intended
for Gordon Dean.

24
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:33,750
The intel I received said
it will be left for him

25
00:02:33,751 --> 00:02:35,162
at the University of Rome

26
00:02:35,163 --> 00:02:38,162
inside a package shipped
to their museum archive.

27
00:02:38,163 --> 00:02:39,786
Well, how will we know which package?

28
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:42,160
It will be sent from Milan,
from an alias...

29
00:02:42,161 --> 00:02:43,561
Marcello Demasi.

30
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:47,601
I found the alias. Can you give me
a minute to find the name?

31
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:54,785
Here it is. Marcello Demasi. Num...

32
00:02:54,786 --> 00:02:55,786
Sydney?

33
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:57,851
Sydney Bristow?

34
00:02:58,975 --> 00:03:00,162
I don't believe it.

35
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:01,975
Professor Choi.

36
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,537
Sydney, I need the lock number.

37
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:07,098
Look at you. You look great.

38
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,225
Thank you.

39
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:09,226
Sydney.

40
00:03:10,164 --> 00:03:11,475
What are you doing in Rome?

41
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:14,974
Sabbatical. I'm teaching classes
and doing some research.

42
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:16,162
And what about you?

43
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,161
Oh, I've just been traveling...
12 countries in 22 months.

44
00:03:21,975 --> 00:03:22,975
Got it. 1222.

45
00:03:23,546 --> 00:03:27,039
I know that's a lot, but I won't have
much of a chance after the baby's born.

46
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,601
Now get out of there
before the Chancellor gets back.

47
00:03:29,602 --> 00:03:32,475
Well, I should let you get back
to your class.

48
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:36,038
No problem. I'm on a lunch break.
We have plenty of time.

49
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:37,599
Great.

50
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,308
You know, uh,
I don't wanna be presumptive,

51
00:03:52,309 --> 00:03:53,662
but, uh, you married?

52
00:03:54,162 --> 00:03:55,162
Newlyweds.

53
00:03:55,788 --> 00:03:57,475
Ah, eager to start a family then?

54
00:03:57,476 --> 00:03:59,101
I guess you could say we dove right in.

55
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:00,727
Well, he must be some guy.

56
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:02,352
You seem really happy.

57
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:05,724
He is.

58
00:04:10,603 --> 00:04:11,915
I found the shipment.

59
00:04:12,287 --> 00:04:13,974
I'm retrieving the package.

60
00:04:15,476 --> 00:04:16,476
I'll take that.

61
00:04:21,475 --> 00:04:22,912
Put it down. Step back.

62
00:04:55,352 --> 00:04:56,352
Got it.

63
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,038
I'm on my way to the extraction point.

64
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:02,039
So is he here with you, your husband?

65
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,165
He's at the hotel.

66
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:06,975
I'd love for you to meet him.
We'll take you to dinner,

67
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:08,728
if you'll just write down your number.

68
00:05:08,729 --> 00:05:11,479
Sure, I would like that.
Here, take my card.

69
00:05:23,778 --> 00:05:25,275
It was inside the sculpture.

70
00:05:25,276 --> 00:05:26,713
Any idea what it's for?

71
00:05:26,714 --> 00:05:27,714
No.

72
00:05:29,088 --> 00:05:32,038
So who was that man?

73
00:05:32,522 --> 00:05:33,584
- Choi?
- No one.

74
00:05:35,212 --> 00:05:36,774
He was from another life.

75
00:06:30,068 --> 00:06:31,628
She's still unresponsive.

76
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,630
There's been no change since yesterday.

77
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:35,818
I'm afraid the xylenol didn't work.

78
00:06:36,003 --> 00:06:38,649
The drug is still
in the experimental age.

79
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,065
It deserves more time.

80
00:06:40,757 --> 00:06:42,484
Mr. Sloane, we've kept Nadia

81
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,569
in a medically induced coma
for five months now.

82
00:06:46,877 --> 00:06:48,938
None of our procedures
have shown any promise.

83
00:06:48,939 --> 00:06:52,816
When we bring her out, she displays
the same violent propensities.

84
00:06:54,568 --> 00:06:56,692
Now these treatments
are extremely costly.

85
00:06:56,693 --> 00:06:58,593
Expense is not an issue.

86
00:06:58,691 --> 00:07:00,691
We've simply run out of options.

87
00:07:01,316 --> 00:07:04,252
At this point, anything that we may try
is unlikely to inspire change.

88
00:07:04,253 --> 00:07:06,440
It may even do more harm than good.

89
00:07:07,005 --> 00:07:08,817
I am not prepared to give up.

90
00:07:08,818 --> 00:07:09,818
Neither are we.

91
00:07:10,941 --> 00:07:14,689
In the meantime, I think
you should consider alternative care

92
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:16,878
in a place a little more comfortable.

93
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,379
Okay, thank you, Doctor.

94
00:07:28,664 --> 00:07:29,690
Yes?

95
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:31,128
How is she doing today?

96
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,319
I feel for you.

97
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:36,466
I can't imagine how hard it must be

98
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:38,940
looking into the face of your own sins.

99
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:40,128
What do you want, Dean?

100
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:43,691
Sydney Bristow has taken something
of mine... an access card.

101
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,317
I want you to get it back.

102
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:47,930
Why? What is it for?

103
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:51,694
That's none of your concern.
48 hours. Don't let me down.

104
00:07:57,503 --> 00:07:59,193
Are you sure this is the right move?

105
00:07:59,194 --> 00:08:00,194
The right move?

106
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:01,752
If they find out what you're up to...

107
00:08:01,753 --> 00:08:02,758
They won't.

108
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,507
Besides, I don't think
I have the choice at this point.

109
00:08:05,508 --> 00:08:07,258
You're being paranoid again.

110
00:08:07,317 --> 00:08:10,692
You're too important to this operation
to be dismissed over a few setbacks.

111
00:08:10,693 --> 00:08:12,067
Well, maybe you're right,

112
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:15,755
but some life insurance
will help me sleep better at night.

113
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:17,567
You too, I imagine.

114
00:08:18,444 --> 00:08:20,317
Odds are if they terminate me,

115
00:08:20,318 --> 00:08:23,443
they'll decide our entire cell
is a security risk.

116
00:08:24,506 --> 00:08:27,131
I'll let you know
when Sloane contacts me.

117
00:08:45,694 --> 00:08:46,694
Hello, Jack.

118
00:08:46,819 --> 00:08:49,754
Arvin, good news.
Sydney's mission in Italy was a success.

119
00:08:49,755 --> 00:08:51,317
Yes, I already knew that.

120
00:08:52,379 --> 00:08:53,379
Did you?

121
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:55,945
How?

122
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,254
Gordon Dean told me.

124
00:09:38,907 --> 00:09:41,406
Marshall ran analysis
on the card you retrieved?

125
00:09:41,407 --> 00:09:44,346
He suspects it's an access key
for a secure network.

126
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:47,097
So we just have to figure out
which network.

127
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,719
Luckily, there are only
10 billion secure networks in the world.

128
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,967
We may have a dead end on that side,
but we intercepted Dean's property.

129
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:57,030
I'm guessing
he's not too happy about that, so...

130
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,658
I'll take what I can get.

131
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:05,594
- Delivery for Sydney Bristow.
- Hey, come on in.

132
00:10:06,532 --> 00:10:08,780
Just put it in the nursery.
It's right through there.

133
00:10:08,781 --> 00:10:09,781
Thanks.

134
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:15,847
Crib.

135
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:24,969
You know, the, uh,
the nursery could use a little work.

136
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:28,158
I don't know. I think it's kind of airy.

137
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:31,971
I'll grab my bag.
We can head in to work.

138
00:10:31,972 --> 00:10:33,655
I thought you were taking the day off.

139
00:10:33,656 --> 00:10:34,656
I was.

140
00:10:35,097 --> 00:10:38,972
That was before we had ten billion
secure networks to analyze.

141
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:42,220
I have a better idea.

142
00:10:42,348 --> 00:10:43,907
First, let's set up the crib, and then

143
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:44,966
at least that way,

144
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:46,968
we'll know we got something
accomplished today.

145
00:10:46,969 --> 00:10:48,719
It's okay. I'll do it later.

146
00:10:48,909 --> 00:10:50,971
What could it take, half an hour?

147
00:10:53,283 --> 00:10:55,597
I used to think that stuff
would be so fun...

148
00:10:55,598 --> 00:10:59,560
decorating a room
and picking out colors.

149
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:06,973
It hasn't turned out exactly the way
I thought it would.

150
00:11:12,285 --> 00:11:13,285
Yeah?

151
00:11:14,034 --> 00:11:16,159
I was first contacted a month ago.

152
00:11:16,598 --> 00:11:18,910
It was during my sentencing hearings.

153
00:11:19,035 --> 00:11:21,847
As I told your father,
the terms were simple.

154
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,953
They offered to sway

155
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:26,660
the committee's decision
for my release...

156
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,785
and I, in turn,
would be indebted to them.

157
00:11:32,348 --> 00:11:35,179
It was not made clear
what that would entail,

158
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,348
but I had an idea.

159
00:11:36,971 --> 00:11:39,347
You've been lying to us this whole time.

160
00:11:39,348 --> 00:11:40,910
There's no justification.

161
00:11:42,283 --> 00:11:44,783
However, faced with spending
the rest of my life in prison

162
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:46,649
while my daughter
was in the hospital, I...

163
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,642
Nadia hasn't made any improvement.

164
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:51,161
Why admit this to us now?
What's changed?

165
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,910
Nadia won't be getting better, Jack.

166
00:11:57,409 --> 00:12:00,346
If I have to face a life
without my daughter...

167
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:03,723
I still have to live with myself.

168
00:12:06,535 --> 00:12:10,347
It sounds hollow, I know,
in light of what I just told you...

169
00:12:11,035 --> 00:12:13,535
but I consider you both to be my family.

170
00:12:14,724 --> 00:12:16,786
You expect us to forgive you now?

171
00:12:17,098 --> 00:12:18,535
No, Sydney, not at all.

172
00:12:19,909 --> 00:12:22,372
I know how much pain
Dean has caused you

173
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:24,034
as well as Rachel Gibson.

174
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:27,183
I have damaged your investigation
enough.

175
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:32,658
Ironically, Dean's arrangement
puts me in a unique position.

176
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:36,096
The last thing he expects of me
is to double cross him.

177
00:12:36,285 --> 00:12:37,720
You'll help us arrest him?

178
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:38,721
Yes.

179
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,800
He's tasked me
with recovering something

180
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:42,301
you took from him... an access card.

181
00:12:42,302 --> 00:12:43,536
I can use that as bait.

182
00:12:43,786 --> 00:12:45,847
Understand something.
If this is a setup...

183
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,785
It's not, Sydney, I assure you.

184
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:51,222
Once we have Dean in custody,

185
00:12:51,223 --> 00:12:53,722
he will be forced
to expose his organization,

186
00:12:53,723 --> 00:12:57,035
and you will have all the answers
you're looking for.

187
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:06,098
You have a way to contact Dean?

188
00:13:09,724 --> 00:13:10,724
Hello?

189
00:13:11,095 --> 00:13:12,095
It's me.

190
00:13:13,098 --> 00:13:14,535
I have what you wanted.

191
00:13:15,287 --> 00:13:17,412
Good. I knew I could count on you.

192
00:13:20,285 --> 00:13:21,597
Where should we meet?

193
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:23,349
Get a pen. Write this down.

194
00:13:25,224 --> 00:13:27,286
The meeting place is a racetrack.

195
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:30,660
Dean may trust Sloane,
but he's still being cautious.

196
00:13:30,785 --> 00:13:33,222
He picked this location
because it's safe...

197
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:35,785
several exit strategies,
a large crowd to blend in with.

198
00:13:35,786 --> 00:13:38,661
That or maybe he's got
Lollipop in the second.

199
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:41,284
We'll have to grab him
before he has the chance to slip out.

200
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:42,472
That won't be easy.

201
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:44,908
Dean doesn't go anywhere
without a security detail.

202
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:48,411
It'll most likely be two men
heavily armed, nearly invisible.

203
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:50,909
We can assume that one
will shadow Dean, the other Sloane.

204
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:53,597
Um, sorry. Is anybody else
having déja vu here?

205
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:56,597
I mean, first Sloane was good,
then he's bad, now he's good again?

206
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:59,473
Although I guess he was bad at first,
I just thought...

207
00:13:59,474 --> 00:14:02,224
We have a significant
tactical disadvantage.

208
00:14:02,225 --> 00:14:04,850
Dean knows what we look like.
He can I.D. every one of us.

209
00:14:04,851 --> 00:14:07,038
Not everyone. He's never seen me...

210
00:14:07,451 --> 00:14:09,411
but I look forward
to making his acquaintance.

211
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:11,162
Good. Tom, you'll take lead.

212
00:14:11,534 --> 00:14:13,992
Dixon, Sydney, Rachel,
you'll provide support in the field.

213
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:17,159
I want a plan drafted within the hour.
Wheels up at 1500.

214
00:14:17,212 --> 00:14:20,287
We may not have another chance
like this. Let's make it count.

215
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:39,319
Dean's reserved you a seat
in the grandstand.

216
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,400
He won't arrive
until he's confirmed you're alone.

217
00:14:41,401 --> 00:14:42,833
If we put a transmitter on you,

218
00:14:42,834 --> 00:14:44,647
his security countermeasures
may detect it,

219
00:14:44,648 --> 00:14:46,710
so I'll be tracking you remotely.

220
00:14:47,022 --> 00:14:48,084
You'll need this.

221
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:49,898
It's a facsimile, I assume.

222
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:51,086
No, it's the real card.

223
00:14:51,087 --> 00:14:53,149
Dean may verify it with a reader.

224
00:14:53,774 --> 00:14:55,930
We'll move in as soon as
we've intercepted his men,

225
00:14:55,931 --> 00:14:57,803
but until then, you'll have to stall.

226
00:14:57,804 --> 00:14:58,804
Okay.

227
00:15:01,616 --> 00:15:04,427
I hacked into the closed-circuit feeds.
We're ready to go.

228
00:15:04,428 --> 00:15:05,428
Okay, you're up.

229
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:07,364
Look, Sydney...

230
00:15:08,553 --> 00:15:11,865
I may have lost the opportunity
to save my own child.

231
00:15:12,304 --> 00:15:14,428
I only hope that by taking out Dean,

232
00:15:14,429 --> 00:15:16,491
I will have helped to save yours.

233
00:15:17,424 --> 00:15:18,424
Good luck.

234
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:27,860
Okay. Dixon and Tom are in position.

235
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:30,109
No sign of Dean yet.

236
00:15:30,299 --> 00:15:33,361
He won't reveal himself
until Sloane is in place.

237
00:15:39,736 --> 00:15:41,360
Excuse me. Mama comin' through!

238
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:43,611
Watch out. Don't jostle the package!

239
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:49,673
How y'all doin'?

240
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,050
How y'all doin'?

241
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:53,858
You gonna help me
pick a winner today, skinny?

242
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:55,646
Ha ha. He's cute...

243
00:15:55,798 --> 00:15:57,498
for a Sheik.

244
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,918
Excuse me that's my seat.

245
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:22,562
Okay, laser mic's on target, Phoenix.
Reception's good.

246
00:16:28,313 --> 00:16:30,063
Hey, Base. You got a visual?

247
00:16:30,687 --> 00:16:32,187
Affirmative, Sidewinder.

248
00:16:33,063 --> 00:16:37,188
Good, 'cause, uh, I was wondering,
what do you think of this suit?

249
00:16:37,653 --> 00:16:38,683
Pretty sweet, huh?

250
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:40,312
Yeah, it's a nice suit on you.

251
00:16:40,313 --> 00:16:44,000
Blue's a good color.
And for you as well, Director Bristow.

252
00:16:44,122 --> 00:16:47,559
Thanks. Oracle, can you get us
a closer look at Sloane?

253
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,812
- How's that?
- Fine.

254
00:16:54,435 --> 00:16:55,435
I got him.

255
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:58,122
The package has arrived. East concourse.

256
00:16:58,123 --> 00:16:59,123
There.

257
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,687
Sloane's in position.

258
00:17:05,812 --> 00:17:07,183
Sidewinder, we're headed your way.

259
00:17:07,184 --> 00:17:08,684
Ten four. Let's do this.

260
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:22,623
We've got you.

261
00:17:33,124 --> 00:17:34,499
Sidewinder, you're up.

262
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:44,059
How ya doin', mate?

263
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,307
Well, I'm fantastic. Thanks for asking.
You know why?

264
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:48,486
The Tasmanian Devil
is straight as a string.

265
00:17:48,487 --> 00:17:50,049
Gonna make me a rich man.

266
00:17:50,052 --> 00:17:52,052
The thing is, I'm short 2 grand.

267
00:17:52,053 --> 00:17:54,599
What do you say you front me,
and I double it for you by dark?

268
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,121
- Not today.
- Come on, mate.

269
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:58,551
That watch alone
would get me 2 grand across the card.

270
00:17:58,562 --> 00:17:59,989
We need an assist here.

271
00:18:01,641 --> 00:18:02,641
This way.

272
00:18:07,141 --> 00:18:09,830
First security detail down.
The second one hasn't shown.

273
00:18:09,831 --> 00:18:11,455
But this guy's wearing an earpiece.

274
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:13,645
Which means
Dean's communicating with him via radio.

275
00:18:13,646 --> 00:18:14,734
He could be anywhere.

276
00:18:14,735 --> 00:18:16,516
Outrigger, until we I.D.
the second detail,

277
00:18:16,517 --> 00:18:18,014
we'll have to proceed with the meet.

278
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,048
Copy that.

279
00:18:26,455 --> 00:18:28,642
You search crowd. Someone you know?

280
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:31,852
Yes, I do.

281
00:18:33,603 --> 00:18:34,603
Lovely day.

282
00:18:36,728 --> 00:18:37,728
Yes, it is.

283
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,913
Outrigger, if Dean's following
his standard protocol,

284
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:46,601
that second detail shouldn't be any more
than 50 feet away.

285
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:49,287
Do you have something for me?

286
00:18:49,538 --> 00:18:50,538
I do.

287
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:05,164
Outrigger, I've got him at 12:00.
Blue cap, binoculars.

288
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,850
I'm on it.

289
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:11,666
Excuse me, Sir.
I believe you have my seat.

290
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
Drinks too much.

291
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:16,916
Filthy habit.

292
00:19:20,415 --> 00:19:22,164
Second security detail is down.

293
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:23,165
Good work.

294
00:19:27,727 --> 00:19:29,852
Outrigger and Sidewinder, move in.

295
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:36,883
It's been a pleasure.

296
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,632
Post one, what's your status?

297
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:42,633
Outrigger, Sidewinder, move in.

298
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:46,194
Post two, what's your status?

299
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,755
Oracle, I've lost sight of him.

300
00:19:52,009 --> 00:19:53,383
Post two, do you copy?

301
00:19:53,384 --> 00:19:56,070
Sidewinder, come in!
Outrigger, do you copy?

302
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,320
Their P.A. System must be bleeding
into our channel.

303
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,508
I'll try to find an open frequency.

304
00:20:00,755 --> 00:20:02,942
Oracle, do you copy me? I've lost...

305
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:06,505
- Outrigger? Phoenix?
- Come in! We've got a problem!

306
00:20:06,944 --> 00:20:07,944
Stand up.

307
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:09,508
What?

308
00:20:09,757 --> 00:20:11,257
We're gonna take a walk.

309
00:20:11,897 --> 00:20:12,897
Do it now.

310
00:20:17,523 --> 00:20:18,523
Base? Anyone?

311
00:20:22,011 --> 00:20:23,015
Phoenix!

312
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:24,853
Damn it.

313
00:20:28,788 --> 00:20:29,916
You don't need to do this.

314
00:20:29,917 --> 00:20:32,354
I'm telling you, I came here by myself.

315
00:20:32,476 --> 00:20:33,476
Just keep going.

316
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:48,542
Stop.

317
00:20:58,476 --> 00:21:00,226
Well, isn't this a surprise?

318
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:05,479
What are you doing here, Rachel?

319
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,914
You gonna fight me?

320
00:21:14,478 --> 00:21:17,415
Why do you think we never put you
in the field?

321
00:21:18,354 --> 00:21:20,228
Because we knew you weren't equipped.

322
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:21,229
Well, then...

323
00:21:22,417 --> 00:21:23,604
that was your loss.

324
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,888
Oracle, come in. Do you have a visual?

325
00:21:37,889 --> 00:21:39,701
Yeah, actually on... on Dean.

326
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,450
- What's he doing?
- Eating dirt.

327
00:21:42,451 --> 00:21:43,952
I just hit him with a shovel.

328
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:45,578
A shovel? Is he conscious?

329
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,202
Yeah, I think so.

330
00:21:47,328 --> 00:21:48,515
Then hit him again.

331
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:18,828
- We got Dean.
- That's good.

332
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,642
What happens now?

333
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,517
He tells us everything.

334
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:26,078
And we get the truth about Prophet Five.

335
00:22:44,837 --> 00:22:47,087
You seem very pleased with yourself.

336
00:22:48,647 --> 00:22:50,022
I'll keep this simple.

337
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:52,773
We have a few questions for you.

338
00:22:52,774 --> 00:22:55,833
We want to know who you're working for
and what their agenda is.

339
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:59,646
The only other question is
whether you'll cooperate willingly

340
00:22:59,773 --> 00:23:00,773
or unwillingly.

341
00:23:01,398 --> 00:23:03,460
The ironic thing is, Ms. Bristow,

342
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:08,145
you and I may not share the same agenda,
but we have the same goal.

343
00:23:08,334 --> 00:23:11,395
I want to know who I'm working for
as much as you do.

344
00:23:11,396 --> 00:23:13,271
Unfortunately, for both of us,

345
00:23:13,648 --> 00:23:15,773
you robbed me of that opportunity.

346
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:18,959
The access card.

347
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,336
You were making a power play.

348
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:22,977
The people I answer to...

349
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:25,709
their power stems
from remaining anonymous.

350
00:23:26,086 --> 00:23:28,711
I was hoping
to balance the playing field.

351
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:30,691
All the information you want

352
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:34,149
can be accessed off a communication hub
using that card.

353
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,337
But before I tell you the location,

354
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:39,584
you have to agree
to do something for me.

355
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,962
And what is that?

356
00:23:42,586 --> 00:23:43,773
I want $10 million,

357
00:23:45,525 --> 00:23:49,209
as well as documents to authenticate
half a dozen false identities

358
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:53,395
and dental implants capable of fooling
facial-recognition software.

359
00:23:53,396 --> 00:23:54,396
In short,

360
00:23:55,212 --> 00:23:57,337
you're going to make me disappear.

361
00:23:59,462 --> 00:24:01,707
- Not a chance.
- I wouldn't be so hasty.

362
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:05,493
That access card will expire
in just under 12 hours,

363
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,185
at which point
the information will vanish

364
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:11,117
and I can no longer help you, so...

365
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:14,559
I suggest you talk
to the people you answer to

366
00:24:15,185 --> 00:24:16,997
and share with them my offer.

367
00:24:17,995 --> 00:24:18,995
I don't need to.

368
00:24:21,181 --> 00:24:23,681
I don't think it's gonna take that long.

369
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:39,994
- What is it?
- L.S.D.

370
00:24:40,431 --> 00:24:41,431
Well, sort of.

371
00:24:42,869 --> 00:24:45,559
See, I started with a lysergic acid
diethylamide-based serum

372
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:46,560
and, you know...

373
00:24:47,494 --> 00:24:48,494
flinkmanized it.

374
00:24:48,997 --> 00:24:51,743
Of course, he's not gonna see
any dancing bears on this trip,

375
00:24:51,744 --> 00:24:52,931
I promise you that.

376
00:24:52,995 --> 00:24:57,120
Not that... I mean, I heard about it
from a guy once. I've never...

377
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,009
Hey, Mr. Bristow.

378
00:24:59,029 --> 00:25:00,634
How long until we can interrogate Dean?

379
00:25:00,635 --> 00:25:02,883
Not long. In about an hour,
he'll think you're God.

380
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:04,760
He'll tell you anything you wanna know.

381
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:08,323
Of course, if you'd like,
I could facilitate the process.

382
00:25:08,573 --> 00:25:09,573
Let's do that.

383
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,885
I see you've done this before.

384
00:25:44,761 --> 00:25:46,698
- Peaceful, hmm?
- Yeah, it is.

385
00:25:51,195 --> 00:25:54,820
I imagine you're having quite
a difficult day. Am I right?

386
00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:59,073
Excuse me, do I know you?

387
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:02,323
Nope, you don't know me, Mr. Sloane.

388
00:26:05,071 --> 00:26:07,821
But I do have one small favor
to ask of you.

389
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:13,760
My associates and I are aware
of your adventure in Dubai.

390
00:26:13,761 --> 00:26:15,548
We also know that Gordon Dean

391
00:26:15,549 --> 00:26:18,198
is still in custody,
presumably at A.P.O.

392
00:26:18,884 --> 00:26:20,696
We need you to eliminate him.

393
00:26:21,325 --> 00:26:22,325
Eliminate him?

394
00:26:22,884 --> 00:26:24,457
Yes, and we have every confidence that

395
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,709
you'll be able to overcome any obstacles
that stand in your way.

396
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,710
I see.

397
00:26:29,585 --> 00:26:30,772
You can go to hell.

398
00:26:31,835 --> 00:26:33,960
I've already confessed
my bargain with Mr. Dean,

399
00:26:33,961 --> 00:26:36,458
you people no longer have
any power over me.

400
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:37,459
That may be.

401
00:26:38,274 --> 00:26:40,586
But we do still have plenty to offer.

402
00:26:40,835 --> 00:26:43,960
I doubt there's anything
that you could do for me.

403
00:26:45,724 --> 00:26:47,411
Uh, you should answer that.

404
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:50,850
Yeah?

405
00:27:02,285 --> 00:27:03,285
My God.

406
00:27:11,037 --> 00:27:12,037
What did you do?

407
00:27:12,349 --> 00:27:13,974
Nothing. It just happened.

408
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:18,912
The nurse came through on rounds
15 minutes ago and found her awake.

409
00:27:19,786 --> 00:27:20,786
Dad?

410
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:24,850
I'm right here, sweetheart.
I'm right here.

411
00:27:27,786 --> 00:27:28,786
Where am I?

412
00:27:29,913 --> 00:27:31,663
You're gonna be okay, Nadia.

413
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:35,287
You're gonna be okay.

414
00:27:47,588 --> 00:27:49,643
Well, his brain waves
are all over the place,

415
00:27:49,644 --> 00:27:52,098
which I guess explains
why his heart rate's off the chart.

416
00:27:52,099 --> 00:27:53,849
Maybe Twisted Sister
wasn't the way to go.

417
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:54,975
- Cut it.
- Right.

418
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:57,579
You know, I think I gave him
too much diophorazide.

419
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,765
My bad.
I mean, he is hallucinating hard.

420
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:02,271
Whatever he's seeing,
it's scaring him to death, literally.

421
00:28:02,272 --> 00:28:04,666
We have to stabilize his vitals.
He won't talk otherwise.

422
00:28:04,667 --> 00:28:07,228
Well, no, I don't think his body
can withstand any more drugs.

423
00:28:07,229 --> 00:28:08,246
Then what do we do?

424
00:28:08,247 --> 00:28:10,535
Well, not that I would know or anything,
but...

425
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:13,268
well, he needs to feel safe.

426
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:16,592
I mean, maybe if somebody
comforted him...

427
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:29,816
You!

428
00:28:29,817 --> 00:28:32,137
I'm not gonna hurt you.

429
00:28:33,129 --> 00:28:36,069
I know you're scared. Just relax.

430
00:28:37,485 --> 00:28:38,494
They want me dead.

431
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:40,752
They'll kill me.

432
00:28:40,821 --> 00:28:43,380
Well, that won't happen. I won't let it.

433
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:45,691
I'm taking care of you now.

434
00:28:51,754 --> 00:28:54,879
Okay, his heart rate is coming down.
It's working!

435
00:28:55,752 --> 00:28:57,814
I'm gonna ask you some questions.

436
00:28:58,004 --> 00:29:01,068
When you answer me,
I'll make sure no one can hurt you.

437
00:29:01,069 --> 00:29:02,414
Okay? No one.

438
00:29:02,818 --> 00:29:03,943
Do you understand?

439
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:06,740
They want my eyes.

440
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:09,754
Don't let them take my eyes.

441
00:29:09,755 --> 00:29:13,979
No, I won't. No one can hurt you
as long as I'm here. No one.

442
00:29:15,381 --> 00:29:18,784
Listen, the access card...

443
00:29:20,005 --> 00:29:24,255
it was designed to patch into
a specific network. Tell me which one.

444
00:29:27,441 --> 00:29:30,170
Which network does the card access?

445
00:29:32,943 --> 00:29:33,943
I can help you.

446
00:29:35,418 --> 00:29:40,873
When you see the watchman,
you'll need me. I can help you.

447
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:44,620
Listen to me, you need to focus.

448
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:48,693
How do I get
into your organization's network?

449
00:29:52,819 --> 00:29:53,881
Get away from me!

450
00:29:54,634 --> 00:29:55,634
It's your fault!

451
00:29:56,197 --> 00:29:59,259
I needed to find the secret.
I needed protection!

452
00:29:59,571 --> 00:30:00,820
I'm protecting you now.

453
00:30:00,821 --> 00:30:03,196
Tell me the secret. I'll keep it safe.

454
00:30:05,383 --> 00:30:06,695
Stay with me, Gordon.

455
00:30:08,073 --> 00:30:11,021
The watchman is on the roof.

456
00:30:11,508 --> 00:30:13,648
You need to go...

457
00:30:15,259 --> 00:30:16,259
to the roof.

458
00:30:16,883 --> 00:30:18,669
Okay, which roof?

459
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:20,108
Where do I find it?

460
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:24,509
Glenheim.

461
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:26,760
Okay, what is Glenheim?

462
00:30:27,884 --> 00:30:30,131
Okay, there's a Glenheim corporation
in Seattle.

463
00:30:30,132 --> 00:30:31,382
The Glenheim Towers.

464
00:30:31,383 --> 00:30:32,737
Pull up the building schematics.

465
00:30:32,738 --> 00:30:34,760
I'll pull up the building schematics.

466
00:30:35,134 --> 00:30:38,203
Okay, there's a satellite on the roof
connected to the network of servers.

467
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,446
Rachel, we need a plane fueled

468
00:30:39,447 --> 00:30:42,384
and ready to leave for Seattle
within the hour.

469
00:30:42,958 --> 00:30:43,958
Hello.

470
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:46,956
When?

471
00:30:56,458 --> 00:30:58,020
I shouldn't have done it.

472
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:00,340
I didn't mean to.

473
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:03,393
They insisted.

474
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,457
You didn't want to do what?

475
00:31:06,583 --> 00:31:09,730
They insisted to kill Michael Vaughn.

476
00:31:13,309 --> 00:31:16,434
I can help you defeat them,
but you have to hurry.

477
00:31:16,749 --> 00:31:18,590
They have plans for you.

478
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:20,999
What plans?

479
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:28,061
Sydney, you need to go.
I'll take over from here.

480
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:31,062
It's Nadia.

481
00:31:37,123 --> 00:31:39,748
You've never looked more beautiful,
Nadia.

482
00:31:43,811 --> 00:31:44,873
Sovogda?

483
00:31:45,898 --> 00:31:46,937
What happened?

484
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:50,063
I'll tell you about it in time.
Just rest for now.

485
00:31:51,516 --> 00:31:53,442
- Dad?
- I listen.

486
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,457
Where's the doctor?

487
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:59,331
Just stepped out for a minute.

488
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,081
What's happening?

489
00:32:04,144 --> 00:32:05,706
Oh, God. Please, I need help here!

490
00:32:05,707 --> 00:32:08,939
Please! Help! I need help here! Doctor!

491
00:32:11,265 --> 00:32:13,514
I need you to step back, Mr. Sloane.

492
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,106
Nadia! Please!

493
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:19,945
Blood pressure 70 over 50.
I need 500 milligrams of detropine I.V.

494
00:32:52,329 --> 00:32:54,454
We were forced to induce coma again.

495
00:32:54,455 --> 00:32:55,767
Look, I'll be honest.

496
00:32:56,076 --> 00:33:00,138
Waking up without any signs
of her disease was, frankly, a fluke.

497
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:02,453
Without an explanation,

498
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:05,579
it's likely this is never
gonna happen again.

499
00:33:06,266 --> 00:33:08,453
Of course, we'll watch her closely.

500
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:11,578
Thank you, doctor.

501
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:25,142
You've done everything you can for her.

502
00:33:25,456 --> 00:33:27,831
Beyond that, it's out of your control.

503
00:33:28,703 --> 00:33:29,828
Thank you, Sydney.

504
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,016
This is Outrigger. We've touched down.

505
00:33:57,017 --> 00:33:58,017
Copy that.

506
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:00,275
I heard. Are you okay?

507
00:34:00,379 --> 00:34:01,393
Yeah.

508
00:34:01,394 --> 00:34:03,142
- How's Sloane?
- Not well.

509
00:34:17,596 --> 00:34:19,390
We figured out what Dean
was talking about.

510
00:34:19,391 --> 00:34:21,333
The network his organization's using
is mobile.

511
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:22,393
Meaning?

512
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:25,637
Their communications are piggy-backed
through a series of telecom satellites.

513
00:34:25,638 --> 00:34:27,787
The Glenheim people
don't know they're being used,

514
00:34:27,788 --> 00:34:29,057
which is exactly the point.

515
00:34:29,058 --> 00:34:32,164
They wouldn't know the network was there
unless they were looking for it.

516
00:34:32,165 --> 00:34:33,465
Further, the network is rerouted

517
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,253
every few days
as a precautionary measure.

518
00:34:35,254 --> 00:34:37,141
If we lose them now,
we won't find them again.

519
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,580
How much time do we have?

520
00:34:38,581 --> 00:34:40,018
12 minutes, 58 seconds.

521
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,579
Sidewinder, what's your status?

522
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,639
We're at the dish.
We're cutting through now.

523
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,577
When you open up the panel,
let me know what you're looking at.

524
00:34:47,953 --> 00:34:50,515
I'm looking at a keypad
and an L.C.D. readout.

525
00:34:50,516 --> 00:34:52,532
Okay, um, any access ports?

526
00:34:53,641 --> 00:34:54,641
Affirmative.

527
00:34:54,832 --> 00:34:56,805
Uplink should be coming your way.

528
00:34:56,806 --> 00:34:57,828
Got it.

529
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,974
- Marshall, what are we looking at?
- I'm not sure.

530
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:02,685
It looks like the network's
not tracking back to just one source.

531
00:35:02,686 --> 00:35:03,682
Meaning?

532
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:05,325
Meaning when I try to locate the origin,

533
00:35:05,326 --> 00:35:06,732
several addresses keep popping up.

534
00:35:06,733 --> 00:35:09,894
It looks like the information's
being fed by a number...

535
00:35:10,332 --> 00:35:12,144
wait a minute, that is weird.

536
00:35:12,561 --> 00:35:14,363
One of the nodes streams
to Credit Marquis.

537
00:35:14,564 --> 00:35:16,867
- What's that?
- Public front for French intelligence.

538
00:35:16,927 --> 00:35:19,672
That's not all. I mean,
there's a stream to the Russian S.V.R.,

539
00:35:19,673 --> 00:35:21,769
a European pharmaceutical conglomerate,
the C.D.C.,

540
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:23,270
MI-6, this list goes on.

541
00:35:23,271 --> 00:35:25,006
So they're hijacking government servers?

542
00:35:25,007 --> 00:35:27,212
No, if that were the case,
I'd be able to detect it.

543
00:35:27,213 --> 00:35:28,518
I mean, this suggests...

544
00:35:29,393 --> 00:35:30,643
they are government.

545
00:35:31,708 --> 00:35:32,706
Dad?

546
00:35:32,707 --> 00:35:33,709
Gordon Dean didn't bribe

547
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,797
someone on the inside
to get Sloane out of jail.

548
00:35:35,798 --> 00:35:38,267
His organization
is already on the inside.

549
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:40,207
Marshall, can you trace those nodes?

550
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:42,145
Yeah, let me see what I can do.

551
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:49,519
Right on time.

552
00:35:50,018 --> 00:35:52,330
Network diagnostic is up and running.

553
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:56,706
You got two minutes to grab that coffee.

554
00:35:56,707 --> 00:35:59,207
Oh, and get me a cup, too? Little cream.

555
00:36:07,508 --> 00:36:08,578
Arvin.

556
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,934
For the next minute and a half,
no one knows I'm here.

557
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:12,517
Good. Get me out of these.

558
00:36:13,767 --> 00:36:16,142
That isn't exactly what I had in mind.

559
00:36:18,642 --> 00:36:21,082
Okay, I've narrowed the network down
to 12 isolated nodes.

560
00:36:21,083 --> 00:36:23,018
I think I can trace
their point of origin.

561
00:36:23,019 --> 00:36:24,019
- 12?
- Yeah.

562
00:36:24,769 --> 00:36:27,266
"If there was never a one,
there was ever the 12."

563
00:36:27,267 --> 00:36:30,829
In the Caymans, that was one
of Dean's account protocols.

564
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,328
What just happened?

565
00:36:32,329 --> 00:36:35,704
We're locked out.
Let me try to bypass the encryption.

566
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,980
- Oh, no.
- What is it?

567
00:36:37,981 --> 00:36:39,388
"Grade three watchman encryption."

568
00:36:39,389 --> 00:36:41,186
There's no way around this
in six minutes.

569
00:36:41,191 --> 00:36:42,839
The program's requesting an access code.

570
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,919
Dean mentioned "watchman."

571
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,003
He said when I find the watchman,
he would help me.

572
00:36:46,004 --> 00:36:47,900
This is what he meant.
He has the access code.

573
00:36:47,901 --> 00:36:48,906
Go.

574
00:36:50,473 --> 00:36:51,720
Don't do this, Arvin.

575
00:36:51,721 --> 00:36:54,780
I have the access code.
You can take down Prophet Five.

576
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:56,017
God forgive me.

577
00:37:02,341 --> 00:37:04,695
Help! Somebody, please!

578
00:37:05,718 --> 00:37:09,280
These walls are soundproof.
There's no point in shouting.

579
00:37:34,718 --> 00:37:38,093
According to medical services,
Dean took his own life.

580
00:37:38,718 --> 00:37:40,569
Apparently with a cyanide pill

581
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,530
he had subdermally implanted
inside his cheek.

582
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:46,153
I don't understand.

583
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,902
This morning he wanted immunity.

584
00:37:48,903 --> 00:37:50,028
He wanted to live.

585
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:53,281
Clearly, Dean thrived on power.

586
00:37:53,903 --> 00:37:54,938
Once the drug wore off,

587
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:57,278
he must've realized
he was facing a life sentence.

588
00:37:57,822 --> 00:37:59,977
Death was easier to accept.

589
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:03,405
Marshall counted 12 sources
that make up Prophet Five.

590
00:38:03,406 --> 00:38:04,406
12, dad.

591
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,908
It's like the Alliance all over again.

592
00:38:08,091 --> 00:38:09,091
I know.

593
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:12,091
If they are embedded
inside global government,

594
00:38:12,092 --> 00:38:13,529
where do we even start?

595
00:38:13,904 --> 00:38:15,279
We've already started.

596
00:38:19,902 --> 00:38:21,777
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

597
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:27,528
Do you have any plans for tonight?

598
00:38:28,655 --> 00:38:30,280
What did you have in mind?

599
00:38:34,904 --> 00:38:36,779
You're sure you won't join me?

600
00:38:37,157 --> 00:38:38,969
We can drink to your success.

601
00:38:41,031 --> 00:38:42,531
Or perhaps, if you like,

602
00:38:43,907 --> 00:38:45,919
to soothe your guilt.

603
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:50,780
Guilt isn't one of my driving emotions.

604
00:38:51,093 --> 00:38:52,405
To your success then.

605
00:38:54,344 --> 00:38:57,094
As we agreed,
Dean's operation is now yours.

606
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,283
But with one warning...

607
00:39:00,592 --> 00:39:01,967
I appreciate ambition.

608
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:06,593
But if you're considering
any further betrayals,

609
00:39:06,842 --> 00:39:09,435
they will come at your own expense.

610
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,780
I understand.

611
00:39:23,781 --> 00:39:24,968
I'll be right back.

612
00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:37,845
A job well done, Mr. Sloane.
I'm so glad you took our offer.

613
00:39:37,846 --> 00:39:40,221
I didn't have much of a choice, did I?

614
00:39:40,532 --> 00:39:42,657
- There's always a choice.
- Yeah.

615
00:39:44,218 --> 00:39:45,218
My daughter...

616
00:39:46,531 --> 00:39:47,968
when will she be cured?

617
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:50,016
- Soon.
- Soon?

618
00:39:50,781 --> 00:39:52,532
Perhaps you could be
a bit more specific.

619
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:53,533
I wish I could.

620
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:56,969
But there are a few more things
we need you to do first.

621
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:58,997
- We have a deal.
- No.

622
00:39:59,658 --> 00:40:01,075
We have an arrangement,

623
00:40:01,076 --> 00:40:03,970
which you don't seem
to understand very well.

624
00:40:04,407 --> 00:40:05,594
You son of a bitch.

625
00:40:06,218 --> 00:40:07,343
We'll be in touch.

626
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,218
Till then,
I want you to remember one thing...

627
00:40:11,907 --> 00:40:15,093
you have something now
that you didn't have this morning.

628
00:40:15,094 --> 00:40:16,681
- What's that?
- Hope.

629
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:43,343
- Okay, that's the headboard.
- That's the footboard.

630
00:40:43,344 --> 00:40:45,031
That's what I said.

631
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:49,344
Have you ever actually built
anything before?

632
00:40:49,345 --> 00:40:51,954
Yes, in fact. I built your crib.

633
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:53,970
Really?

634
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,780
Well, your mother and I did it together.

635
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:04,219
Done.

636
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,032
Done?

637
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,344
Why? Did you doubt me?

638
00:41:09,345 --> 00:41:10,998
No, of course not.

639
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:33,534
Get me the screwdriver.
