1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:04,624
It looks like Austin is going with...

2
00:00:05,332 --> 00:00:06,748
...an astronaut.

3
00:00:07,141 --> 00:00:09,705
And Kelly's drawing a police officer.

4
00:00:13,063 --> 00:00:16,224
I'm not sure "elephant"
counts as a job, Laurence.

5
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:25,896
What about you, Sydney?

6
00:00:27,487 --> 00:00:29,104
Are you having trouble getting started?

7
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:32,137
That's okay.

8
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:33,545
I can help you.

9
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:38,192
I want you to close your eyes
and tell me the very first thing

10
00:00:38,197 --> 00:00:40,772
that pops into your mind
when I ask you this question:

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,522
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

12
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:04,673
I just spoke with Zurich.
Sloane hit the twelve. They're all dead.

13
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:06,707
- He's solidifying power.
- I must contact Sydney.

14
00:01:06,707 --> 00:01:07,751
Get Marshall and Rachel.

15
00:01:07,755 --> 00:01:09,511
We'll rendezvous at Mikro storage.

16
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:10,721
Trust no one else.

17
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:15,660
<i>You'll be all right.</i>

18
00:01:15,748 --> 00:01:16,911
Rachel, we have to leave.

19
00:01:19,588 --> 00:01:21,921
We don't have time to mourn right now.

20
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:58,010
One, two... three.

21
00:01:58,625 --> 00:01:59,971
Come on! Come on!

22
00:02:02,816 --> 00:02:05,273
One, two, three...

23
00:02:06,206 --> 00:02:07,861
Come on! You're stronger than this!

24
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:22,721
Excuse me.

25
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,202
Something's happened.

26
00:02:38,126 --> 00:02:39,860
Your mother was in an accident.

27
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:43,910
Her car skidded off the road, and...

28
00:02:47,317 --> 00:02:48,451
She's gone.

29
00:02:51,156 --> 00:02:52,160
Your mother...

30
00:02:53,855 --> 00:02:55,172
She's dead.

31
00:02:58,565 --> 00:03:00,641
sweetheart, I need you
to be strong right now.

32
00:03:04,315 --> 00:03:06,493
I need you to be... strong.

33
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,390
It's okay. You're okay.

34
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:22,652
Everything's gonna be okay.

35
00:03:32,415 --> 00:03:34,703
I saw the news reports on Los Angeles.

36
00:03:34,906 --> 00:03:35,901
Good work.

37
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:38,621
I'm not certain "good" is
the proper word for it, but thank you.

38
00:03:38,827 --> 00:03:41,680
I've dispatched a team to the location
you acquired at Mt. Subasio.

39
00:03:41,895 --> 00:03:44,273
I want to be airborne
as soon as they find something.

40
00:03:44,356 --> 00:03:45,361
Understood.

41
00:03:46,247 --> 00:03:48,653
Were you able to make contact
with our friend in Hong Kong?

42
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:50,420
Yes. She sends her regards.

43
00:04:00,276 --> 00:04:02,101
Should I tell her we have a deal?

44
00:04:06,426 --> 00:04:09,442
Let her know the transports will leave
just as soon as they're ready.

45
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:15,241
Am I to understand that we're still
going through with this?

46
00:04:15,657 --> 00:04:17,721
Don't tell me you're having
second thoughts.

47
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:19,160
Of course not.

48
00:04:20,297 --> 00:04:23,733
It's just it's not every dayone gets
to be a part of global genocide.

49
00:04:27,438 --> 00:04:30,502
If I can get a signal down here, I may
be able to tap into Langley's network.

50
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:32,902
I can spoof the origin.
They won't be able to trace the hack.

51
00:04:32,907 --> 00:04:35,230
Sloane will try to seize control
of Prophet 5's operations

52
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:36,693
as quickly as possible.

53
00:04:36,696 --> 00:04:40,171
We should look to identify
any unusual activity in their holdings.

54
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:44,351
It's me. We're in Siena.

55
00:04:44,788 --> 00:04:46,123
<i>So Sydney is with you?</i>

56
00:04:46,506 --> 00:04:47,953
Yeah.
<i>We're both okay.</i>

57
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:50,233
Thank God.

58
00:04:51,706 --> 00:04:53,462
We've had a situation here.

59
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,770
Homebase has been compromised.

60
00:04:56,657 --> 00:04:58,242
<i>Tom... didn't make it.</i>

61
00:05:01,035 --> 00:05:02,832
<i>Stay at the safe house. Once we gather</i>

62
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:05,091
<i>some more information,
we'll forward it to you there.</i>

63
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:06,380
Got it.

64
00:05:08,278 --> 00:05:09,313
How is she?

65
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:14,331
She took a pretty big hit,
but she'll bounce back.

66
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:08,582
Dad?

67
00:06:09,047 --> 00:06:10,043
You did this?

68
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,561
Can you show me how you did it?

69
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,143
- What?
- It's a test,

70
00:06:51,336 --> 00:06:52,593
called an "indicator."

71
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:55,291
People in my line of work use it

72
00:06:55,296 --> 00:06:58,173
to identify people with a highly developed sense

73
00:06:58,576 --> 00:07:00,063
of 3-dimensional reasoning.

74
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:03,262
Very few people can do it.
I can't do it.

75
00:07:03,587 --> 00:07:04,601
You can't?

76
00:07:06,628 --> 00:07:07,931
What it means, Sydney, is...

77
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:12,643
You are a very special...

78
00:07:13,036 --> 00:07:14,050
...girl.

79
00:07:28,297 --> 00:07:29,423
Twelve hours ago,

80
00:07:29,426 --> 00:07:31,362
two intercontinental
cruise missiles were stolen

81
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:33,200
from a storage facility in Moscow.

82
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:34,512
We think it's Sloane?

83
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,271
Whatever he's up to,

84
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,720
he said it was too late to be stopped.

85
00:07:38,856 --> 00:07:41,070
He also said that he'd wipe out
everyone at A.P.O.

86
00:07:41,266 --> 00:07:42,312
He was wrong.

87
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,432
Still, how can we find him?

88
00:07:45,268 --> 00:07:46,322
It's impossible.

89
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:49,012
We don't have a single lead.

90
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,422
- We can't trust the C.I.A.
- Sydney, stop, alright?

91
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:55,271
Let's not overlook the fact
that you basically died today.

92
00:07:55,376 --> 00:07:57,410
You and I have gotten pretty good
at impossible.

93
00:07:59,576 --> 00:08:01,192
I'm gonna have to deal with this wound.

94
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:03,032
I don't have any anesthetic.
It's gonna hurt.

95
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:09,002
Just hold still.

96
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,923
Sorry.

97
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,772
Why would Sloane steal the missiles?

98
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:23,441
- What?
- He just wiped out the Twelve, right?

99
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:26,601
Which means that he controls
their assets.

100
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:29,442
He wouldn't steal missiles.

101
00:08:29,445 --> 00:08:31,791
He'd just buy them on the black market.

102
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:34,001
I think I know how to find him.

103
00:08:35,578 --> 00:08:36,832
We start with the money.

104
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:44,901
<i>If we can hack into the system,
we can I.D. who the payoffs went to.</i>

105
00:08:49,417 --> 00:08:51,410
<i>Then all we need are phone records.</i>

106
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,863
<i>If I'm right, they'll lead us
right to Sloane...</i>

107
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:02,981
<i>Or at least, someone
he's been working with.</i>

108
00:09:28,438 --> 00:09:30,621
We know you're working
with Arvin Sloane,

109
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:34,203
and we know about the I.C.B.M.S
he's recently acquired.

110
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,112
What we don't know is where they are

111
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:37,551
or where they're headed.

112
00:09:38,145 --> 00:09:40,052
Now I'm well aware that you're tough,

113
00:09:40,316 --> 00:09:42,992
that you've been conditioned
to withstand torture.

114
00:09:44,578 --> 00:09:46,273
But I have something you don't have.

115
00:09:48,096 --> 00:09:49,881
I have your former best friend.

116
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:53,150
And I know what you're afraid of.

117
00:10:01,918 --> 00:10:04,880
If I were you,
I would stay extremely still.

118
00:10:08,198 --> 00:10:09,913
She has no idea
where those missiles are.

119
00:10:09,915 --> 00:10:11,363
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

120
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:14,351
What she does know:
Sloane is planning to target two cities

121
00:10:14,368 --> 00:10:16,241
with high civilian concentrations.

122
00:10:16,486 --> 00:10:18,070
He's not interested in the devastation.

123
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,862
He plans to profit off
the reconstruction.

124
00:10:19,967 --> 00:10:22,400
Sloane controls Prophet 5's network,

125
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:25,013
communications, pharmaceuticals,
finance, he'll make billions.

126
00:10:25,215 --> 00:10:26,250
It gets worse.

127
00:10:27,117 --> 00:10:28,621
Sloane's in Mongolia.

128
00:11:07,826 --> 00:11:10,501
Put on your dancing shoes.
We are going out tonight.

129
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:12,223
I can't tonight.

130
00:11:12,277 --> 00:11:13,822
"Can't" is not an option.

131
00:11:14,068 --> 00:11:16,971
Charlie got us passes
for that new club in Silverlake.

132
00:11:17,216 --> 00:11:19,330
That job fair is tonight.
I really wanna go.

133
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,062
Job fair? What? Syd.

134
00:11:21,677 --> 00:11:24,142
You have four years to figure out
what kind of job you want.

135
00:11:24,175 --> 00:11:26,080
I just had a meeting with my advisor,

136
00:11:26,087 --> 00:11:28,382
and she yelled at me 'cause
I haven't picked a major yet.

137
00:11:28,387 --> 00:11:29,650
Education. Done.

138
00:11:30,145 --> 00:11:31,550
You can be a teacher like your mom.

139
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:33,702
I mean, you always talked about
how happy she was.

140
00:11:33,757 --> 00:11:34,921
I thought about that,

141
00:11:34,928 --> 00:11:37,212
but I've always thought about
teaching as my safety net.

142
00:11:37,215 --> 00:11:38,601
Teaching's no safety net.

143
00:11:38,647 --> 00:11:40,500
You know how dangerous it is
to be a teacher?

144
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,352
Kids bring knives to school these days.

145
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,773
I hate the thought
that I could make a decision now

146
00:11:44,843 --> 00:11:46,547
that would affect the rest of my life.

147
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:48,402
Well, I say go with education.

148
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:52,372
Charlie is bringing a friend tonight,

149
00:11:52,568 --> 00:11:54,023
Danny something.

150
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:57,633
- We'll pick you up at 8:00.
- I'll see you later.

151
00:12:04,477 --> 00:12:06,472
I was hoping I might have
a moment of your time.

152
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:23,292
Tell Dixon we'll touch base

153
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:25,122
as soon as we cross
into Mongolian airspace.

154
00:12:25,127 --> 00:12:27,012
Marshall and I are gonna hack
into the N.R.O.,

155
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:28,762
See if we can use
their optical satellites

156
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:29,741
to locate the missiles.

157
00:12:31,566 --> 00:12:32,670
Rachel, listen.

158
00:12:32,868 --> 00:12:34,052
Prophet 5 is gone.

159
00:12:34,407 --> 00:12:37,682
Your family is no longer in danger.
You don't have to do this anymore.

160
00:12:38,935 --> 00:12:41,952
People have given their lives for this.
I'm not gonna bail on them now.

161
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm in this until it's over.

162
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:47,372
Of course, if we don't find Sloane,

163
00:12:47,506 --> 00:12:49,271
that may not be very long from now.

164
00:13:00,788 --> 00:13:02,370
Did it have to be so filthy?

165
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,482
I mean, really, if Rambaldi
can prophesize the future,

166
00:13:05,487 --> 00:13:08,003
he might have advised me
not to wear $500 shoes.

167
00:13:21,396 --> 00:13:22,782
Structural imaging shows

168
00:13:22,787 --> 00:13:25,412
that there's a chamber
about 200 feet below us.

169
00:13:26,747 --> 00:13:27,803
That's quite a climb.

170
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:29,940
You needn't worry.

171
00:13:31,225 --> 00:13:33,303
The next step is for me alone.

172
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:45,192
At last,

173
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:47,842
after almost 30 years.

174
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:51,631
Is it everything you imagined?

175
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:55,042
I'm so glad you're here.

176
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:57,282
If I didn't have someone
to share this with,

177
00:14:57,287 --> 00:14:58,683
I may have doubted my own eyes.

178
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,902
You're talking to your dead daughter.

179
00:15:01,477 --> 00:15:03,792
This is an odd time
to question your sanity.

180
00:15:04,277 --> 00:15:05,290
Perhaps.

181
00:16:04,445 --> 00:16:05,751
So that's it?

182
00:16:06,456 --> 00:16:08,841
All this time, that's what you wanted.

183
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:10,710
This, sweetheart,

184
00:16:11,076 --> 00:16:13,910
this is what everybody
has always wanted.

185
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,400
And I've found it.

186
00:16:19,565 --> 00:16:20,771
It's over, Sloane.

187
00:16:26,716 --> 00:16:28,293
Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Vaughn,

188
00:16:29,048 --> 00:16:30,600
but aren't you supposed to be dead?

189
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,310
I suppose we'll have to rectify that.

190
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:42,810
Well, then,

191
00:16:43,307 --> 00:16:44,783
it appears we have a predicament.

192
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,452
Don't move.

193
00:16:58,627 --> 00:17:00,191
No! Sydney, don't.

194
00:17:10,968 --> 00:17:11,883
What is this, Sloane?

195
00:17:11,888 --> 00:17:13,302
Sydney, please don't be rash.

196
00:17:13,438 --> 00:17:15,861
Give me one reason why
I shouldn't destroy this right now.

197
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:18,433
Suppose I were to give you
two good reasons.

198
00:17:26,765 --> 00:17:28,893
He's gonna strike the U.S.
Can you purge the virus?

199
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:31,533
No, not from here.
But I did pinpoint the origin.

200
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:33,993
Someone uploaded it from Hong Kong.

201
00:17:36,886 --> 00:17:38,043
Who's in Hong Kong?

202
00:17:41,078 --> 00:17:42,302
Who are you protecting?

203
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:45,631
Should I get the snake?

204
00:17:46,436 --> 00:17:47,432
Don't.

205
00:17:52,378 --> 00:17:54,321
Sloane had to call in a partner.

206
00:17:56,126 --> 00:17:58,102
He needed something he didn't have.

207
00:17:58,425 --> 00:17:59,960
What's that?

208
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,663
Hand me the sphere, Sydney.

209
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:06,950
I'll let you all walk out of here.

210
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:09,743
I won't insult you with pretense,
Sydney.

211
00:18:09,746 --> 00:18:11,401
We know each other too well for that.

212
00:18:13,778 --> 00:18:15,620
Oh, I know you're trying
to figure a way out.

213
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:19,031
Just hand over the sphere,
and I will let you all walk away.

214
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,662
If I give this to you,

215
00:18:23,698 --> 00:18:25,630
what's to guarantee
you won't shoot us anyway?

216
00:18:25,685 --> 00:18:28,062
Despite what you may think,
I'm not heartless.

217
00:18:29,246 --> 00:18:30,970
Come on, take my offer.

218
00:18:31,475 --> 00:18:33,560
It appears that Vaughn is back.

219
00:18:34,658 --> 00:18:36,220
Go. Be a family.

220
00:18:37,335 --> 00:18:39,400
Frankly, I don't think
you have any other option.

221
00:18:39,405 --> 00:18:42,302
If you want this, we'll walk out of here
together, and then we'll talk.

222
00:18:44,506 --> 00:18:46,193
Well, remember, Sydney,
it's your choice.

223
00:18:49,697 --> 00:18:50,702
Dad!

224
00:18:51,738 --> 00:18:52,741
Dad!

225
00:19:22,237 --> 00:19:23,852
Dad? Dad?

226
00:19:25,007 --> 00:19:26,000
Dad? Are you home?

227
00:19:26,636 --> 00:19:29,890
That's right, they're having problems
with their tail rudder controls.

228
00:19:30,247 --> 00:19:32,601
Yeah. Okay, well, I'll get back to you.

229
00:19:34,328 --> 00:19:35,260
Hello, Sydney.

230
00:19:40,418 --> 00:19:41,503
What's this?

231
00:19:41,925 --> 00:19:42,921
Open it.

232
00:19:45,747 --> 00:19:47,161
You've been paying my tuition.

233
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:48,951
I thought I should at least help out.

234
00:19:49,705 --> 00:19:51,062
What'd you do, rob a bank?

235
00:19:51,426 --> 00:19:52,433
Sort of.

236
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,421
I got a job at a bank.

237
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,650
It's just part-time for now,
at least. It's...

238
00:19:57,987 --> 00:20:00,031
It's, a French bank.
It's called Crédit Dauphine.

239
00:20:00,178 --> 00:20:02,192
They have a very international
clientele.

240
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,712
Crédit Dauphine?

241
00:20:06,068 --> 00:20:08,452
Yeah, they have 12 branches
around the world.

242
00:20:08,845 --> 00:20:10,162
You're already working there?

243
00:20:10,637 --> 00:20:11,643
About a month.

244
00:20:12,075 --> 00:20:14,631
I wanted to make sure
it would work out before I told you.

245
00:20:14,987 --> 00:20:16,811
A month. Good.
It's not too late to quit.

246
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,810
- What?
- Sydney, listen to me.

247
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:21,223
I'm not quitting this job.
I like it. I'm good at it.

248
00:20:21,258 --> 00:20:22,980
I imagine you are.
That's not the point.

249
00:20:23,157 --> 00:20:24,713
What is the point?

250
00:20:24,927 --> 00:20:27,471
- God, if mom were here, she...
- If your mother was here...

251
00:20:31,357 --> 00:20:32,711
If your mother was here,

252
00:20:33,616 --> 00:20:35,333
she would want you to focus

253
00:20:35,516 --> 00:20:37,882
on school, which is
what you're going to do.

254
00:20:43,446 --> 00:20:44,932
I didn't come to ask your permission.

255
00:20:48,948 --> 00:20:51,792
- I've already made my decision.
- This is not your decision to make.

256
00:20:55,558 --> 00:20:56,620
Sydney, come back...

257
00:21:07,285 --> 00:21:08,611
- Right here.
- All right, Syd.

258
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:09,850
You're okay, you're okay.

259
00:21:15,168 --> 00:21:17,040
It's okay.
I'm gonna go call for help, okay?

260
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:21,170
Okay, just be still.
Look, you're gonna be okay.

261
00:21:23,005 --> 00:21:24,551
We have a problem. Jack's been shot.

262
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:25,992
- How bad?
<i>- It's critical.</i>

263
00:21:25,996 --> 00:21:27,010
<i>We need air support.<i>

264
00:21:28,066 --> 00:21:29,990
Contact Salim Behari in Ulaanbaatar.

265
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:32,443
Have him send a medevac unit.
Tell them to hurry.

266
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:36,912
Dad, keep talking to me.

267
00:21:37,346 --> 00:21:38,871
I'm doing fine. It's...

268
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:40,080
It's just...

269
00:21:40,976 --> 00:21:42,132
It's just a scratch.

270
00:21:44,526 --> 00:21:45,830
I'm just gonna take a look.

271
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:52,412
You're gonna be okay.

272
00:21:54,036 --> 00:21:55,910
Chopper's on its way.
Should be a half-hour.

273
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,163
- Did you hear that?
<i>- Yeah</i>

274
00:21:57,257 --> 00:21:58,190
<i>Listen.</i>

275
00:21:58,197 --> 00:21:59,600
Sloane's dead, Sark got away.

276
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:01,042
<i>He's got the artifact.</i>

277
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,570
I think we know where he's going.

278
00:22:04,395 --> 00:22:05,460
Sorry.

279
00:22:06,056 --> 00:22:07,053
Sorry.

280
00:22:07,688 --> 00:22:09,292
Medevac's on its way. How's he doing?

281
00:22:10,165 --> 00:22:11,382
His heart rate's up.

282
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,541
I think the bullet penetrated his lung.
He's not getting enough air.

283
00:22:16,488 --> 00:22:17,732
Sloane has a partner.

284
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,231
We know who's behind this.

285
00:22:23,606 --> 00:22:24,820
<i>I have the artifact.</i>

286
00:22:25,108 --> 00:22:26,122
<i>I'm on my way.</i>

287
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:27,372
Good.

288
00:22:28,447 --> 00:22:30,280
See that it gets here intact.

289
00:22:34,968 --> 00:22:35,981
Listen to me.

290
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:39,103
Dad, you have been shot in the chest.

291
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:40,771
The medical team is on their way. You...

292
00:22:40,857 --> 00:22:42,550
I can't risk moving you. Right?
I can't...

293
00:22:42,558 --> 00:22:43,473
Vaughn,

294
00:22:44,305 --> 00:22:46,093
get the transport ready.

295
00:22:47,807 --> 00:22:48,852
Wait, Vaughn...

296
00:22:49,485 --> 00:22:50,713
Wait, Vaughn, wait!

297
00:22:51,258 --> 00:22:52,401
Dad, what are you doing?

298
00:22:52,407 --> 00:22:53,350
You can't go anywhere.

299
00:22:53,367 --> 00:22:56,952
Sydney, your mother's not the type
to make empty threats.

300
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,003
If she's acquired missiles,

301
00:22:59,885 --> 00:23:01,342
she intends to use them.

302
00:23:01,765 --> 00:23:04,842
You can't even stand up straight.
How do you expect to confront mom?

303
00:23:06,537 --> 00:23:07,900
I'm not coming with you.

304
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:14,430
You have to go to Hong Kong.
There's no other way.

305
00:23:17,755 --> 00:23:19,211
I am not leaving you here.

306
00:23:19,475 --> 00:23:20,570
You're the only one

307
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:22,940
who can get to Irina in time.

308
00:23:24,427 --> 00:23:25,542
You're the only one

309
00:23:26,135 --> 00:23:27,133
who can beat her.

310
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:29,833
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

311
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:35,382
I never wanted this life for you,
you know.

312
00:23:38,615 --> 00:23:40,802
I never wanted you to bear this kind

313
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,261
of responsibility, but you...

314
00:23:45,098 --> 00:23:46,733
you were a very...

315
00:23:47,108 --> 00:23:48,663
...difficult little girl...

316
00:23:50,086 --> 00:23:51,621
You were far too driven,

317
00:23:52,138 --> 00:23:53,711
far too strong to let someone

318
00:23:54,446 --> 00:23:56,253
like me stop you from becoming

319
00:23:56,557 --> 00:23:57,682
who you are.

320
00:23:59,335 --> 00:24:00,722
Dad, the medical team is coming.

321
00:24:00,728 --> 00:24:04,200
- If you'll just sit tight...
- Sydney, listen to me.

322
00:24:04,586 --> 00:24:05,823
There's no one

323
00:24:06,705 --> 00:24:08,113
in this world

324
00:24:09,968 --> 00:24:12,073
that can do the things that you can do.

325
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,313
I can hold out until help arrives,

326
00:24:16,797 --> 00:24:17,803
but you have to go.

327
00:24:18,477 --> 00:24:19,903
You have to stop your mother.

328
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:23,862
Okay...

329
00:24:25,017 --> 00:24:26,030
Just...

330
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:28,162
Okay, good. Just...

331
00:24:29,865 --> 00:24:31,300
Keep applying pressure, please.

332
00:24:32,296 --> 00:24:34,052
You... you can't afford
to lose more blood.

333
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:35,540
Just get moving.

334
00:24:39,326 --> 00:24:40,690
I love you, dad.

335
00:24:41,877 --> 00:24:43,070
I love you, Sydney.

336
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:47,271
I don't want to leave you.

337
00:24:47,356 --> 00:24:48,363
G o.

338
00:25:48,515 --> 00:25:50,272
Did everything go according to plan?

339
00:25:50,286 --> 00:25:52,262
Your daughter arrived,
mucked things up a bit.

340
00:25:52,596 --> 00:25:53,720
Sloane's dead,

341
00:25:54,196 --> 00:25:55,622
and we lost the tomb.

342
00:25:56,095 --> 00:25:57,733
But the artifact's intact.

343
00:25:59,068 --> 00:26:00,840
There's a reason my fees are so high.

344
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:03,180
Sloane's death doesn't change
our agenda.

345
00:26:03,475 --> 00:26:04,803
Contact controls.

346
00:26:05,066 --> 00:26:08,133
As soon as the satellites are down,
launch the missile strikes.

347
00:26:08,955 --> 00:26:10,711
Have you decided on the final targets?

348
00:26:11,147 --> 00:26:12,600
Washington and London.

349
00:26:14,285 --> 00:26:15,292
Right away.

350
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,633
What's our status?

351
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:39,723
<i>Mil-sat one just hit atmosphere.</i>

352
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:41,680
<i>The rest of the satellites
are right behind it.</i>

353
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:47,400
Initiate the countdown.

354
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:53,131
Oh, my God.

355
00:26:55,786 --> 00:26:57,013
They've started the launch.

356
00:27:02,478 --> 00:27:03,560
So that's it.

357
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:05,782
It's the Horizon, isn't it?

358
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:10,562
You shot the man I loved.

359
00:27:11,775 --> 00:27:13,380
You betrayed my trust.

360
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:18,511
You risked my daughter's life,
all for that.

361
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:22,062
I don't expect you to understand.

362
00:27:23,296 --> 00:27:24,731
We're very different, Sydney.

363
00:27:25,386 --> 00:27:27,531
You still cling to naive ideals.

364
00:27:28,826 --> 00:27:30,602
I learned, at a very young age,

365
00:27:30,978 --> 00:27:33,692
the only currency worth
anything in this world is power.

366
00:27:35,686 --> 00:27:37,512
And the Horizon gives you that?

367
00:27:37,646 --> 00:27:39,790
You've never seen Rambaldi
for what he is.

368
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,743
You dismissed his work
as the labor of a madman.

369
00:27:46,725 --> 00:27:48,942
You blind yourself
to his true potential.

370
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:53,223
I've spent a lifetime acquiring power.

371
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:54,881
With this...

372
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,823
And I'll never have to give it up.

373
00:28:06,248 --> 00:28:07,823
Rambaldi is life, Sydney.

374
00:28:12,096 --> 00:28:13,762
Through him, we can live forever.

375
00:28:23,698 --> 00:28:25,273
I offered you an out.

376
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,211
I gave you your daughter.

377
00:28:28,016 --> 00:28:30,841
I was hoping you'd settle down,
leave me to my affairs.

378
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:33,282
You don't know me very well, do you?

379
00:28:33,377 --> 00:28:34,842
Sadly, I think I do.

380
00:28:36,997 --> 00:28:38,593
After all, I'm still your mother.

381
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:41,513
That doesn't mean anything.

382
00:28:41,976 --> 00:28:43,011
Not anymore.

383
00:28:44,565 --> 00:28:47,043
I am through being disappointed by you.

384
00:28:48,757 --> 00:28:50,631
I hate that it's come to this.

385
00:28:51,536 --> 00:28:53,052
I suppose it had to.

386
00:28:54,948 --> 00:28:57,972
I've come too far
to let anything get in my way.

387
00:28:59,646 --> 00:29:02,132
Then you'll have to go through me first.

388
00:29:02,635 --> 00:29:03,992
You wanted to see me, sir?

389
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:07,971
I've been reviewing your evaluations
since you arrived at SD-6.

390
00:29:09,617 --> 00:29:11,790
To a letter, they're nothing
short of exemplary.

391
00:29:12,306 --> 00:29:13,952
I've upgraded your clearance,

392
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:17,400
and I'm considering
promoting you to field officer.

393
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:19,051
Really?

394
00:29:20,196 --> 00:29:22,560
Now, Sydney, I want to know
that you have given this job

395
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:23,883
its proper consideration.

396
00:29:23,957 --> 00:29:25,690
I realize that you have
a romantic notion

397
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,983
of the espionage trade, but this job...

398
00:29:28,365 --> 00:29:31,300
...is more than just brush passes
and dead drops.

399
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:35,652
You will be facing life and death
situations on a regular basis.

400
00:29:35,657 --> 00:29:36,842
Do you understand that?

401
00:29:36,847 --> 00:29:38,421
You will be forced to make decisions

402
00:29:38,425 --> 00:29:40,543
that will haunt you
for the rest of your life.

403
00:29:41,747 --> 00:29:43,611
This job requires sacrifice,

404
00:29:43,967 --> 00:29:46,740
and you need to know
that you are able to live with that.

405
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:49,531
I can, sir.

406
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:53,310
For as long as I can remember,
I have been searching...

407
00:29:53,758 --> 00:29:55,160
for what I'm supposed to do,

408
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:57,021
for what I'm supposed to be.

409
00:29:58,845 --> 00:30:00,143
This is my purpose.

410
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:02,423
It's in my blood.

411
00:30:03,965 --> 00:30:05,313
It's who I am.

412
00:30:07,485 --> 00:30:10,782
I have never been so sure
of anything in my life.

413
00:31:05,556 --> 00:31:06,873
Why are you fighting me on this?

414
00:31:09,257 --> 00:31:11,283
The defense satellites are destroyed.

415
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:19,513
The stars will fall from the sky.

416
00:31:22,065 --> 00:31:24,591
Even if you manage to beat me
on this rooftop,

417
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,722
it's still too late to stop the launch.

418
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:32,203
You think I came here alone?

419
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:35,843
<i>Sir, beginning final preparations.</i>

420
00:31:36,008 --> 00:31:37,002
Excellent.

421
00:31:37,077 --> 00:31:38,132
Proceed according to...

422
00:31:46,178 --> 00:31:47,633
It appears we have a predicament.

423
00:31:59,468 --> 00:32:00,542
You did it.

424
00:32:02,038 --> 00:32:03,412
You were right all along.

425
00:32:06,228 --> 00:32:08,402
I will never forget your sacrifice.

426
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:09,700
I promise.

427
00:32:12,595 --> 00:32:14,131
The Horizon is gone.

428
00:32:15,377 --> 00:32:18,921
Your mother is probably dividing up
my spoils as we speak.

429
00:32:19,377 --> 00:32:20,793
Then we should get moving.

430
00:32:23,797 --> 00:32:25,731
We don't have to hurry anymore, Nadia.

431
00:32:26,385 --> 00:32:28,421
We have all the time in the world.

432
00:32:34,337 --> 00:32:35,583
Give me the override codes.

433
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:37,433
I don't have the codes, I swear.

434
00:32:40,627 --> 00:32:42,211
- You shot me!
-Yeah,

435
00:32:42,268 --> 00:32:44,691
and I'll keep shooting
until you either give me the codes

436
00:32:44,698 --> 00:32:45,930
or bleed to death. Your choice.

437
00:32:47,747 --> 00:32:50,132
You know, I didn't want any of this.

438
00:32:51,175 --> 00:32:54,632
Mass extermination isn't exactly
my passion, Michael.

439
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,202
I'm a businessman.

440
00:32:57,798 --> 00:33:00,642
You know, I simply wanted to come out
on the winning end.

441
00:33:03,757 --> 00:33:04,940
I'll give you the codes,

442
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,562
but you have to let me go after I do.

443
00:33:06,738 --> 00:33:08,420
Codes first, then we negotiate.

444
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:14,390
3-9-8-alpha-4-tango-6-4-7.

445
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:18,213
Come on. Come on!

446
00:33:20,785 --> 00:33:21,983
Launch aborted!

447
00:33:26,948 --> 00:33:31,402
I'm afraid I can't allow you to be such
a complication in my life any longer.

448
00:33:35,678 --> 00:33:37,062
For whatever it's worth,

449
00:33:37,757 --> 00:33:39,073
I truly do love you.

450
00:33:55,788 --> 00:33:57,703
I owe you an apology, Arvin.

451
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,963
I never gave your faith in Rambaldi

452
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:03,590
the credit it deserved.

453
00:34:04,188 --> 00:34:06,251
There's no need to apologize, Jack.

454
00:34:07,035 --> 00:34:08,261
You're a practical man.

455
00:34:08,366 --> 00:34:09,952
I'd always admired that in you.

456
00:34:11,356 --> 00:34:13,200
Jack, I didn't wanna shoot you.

457
00:34:14,278 --> 00:34:15,941
Sydney forced my hand.

458
00:34:17,765 --> 00:34:19,031
She can be very...

459
00:34:19,368 --> 00:34:21,021
stubborn at times.

460
00:34:22,207 --> 00:34:23,300
You're dying.

461
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:25,103
I can help you.

462
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:27,643
I don't want your help, Arvin.

463
00:34:29,076 --> 00:34:30,071
You've...

464
00:34:30,888 --> 00:34:33,900
caused my daughter so much pain.

465
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:36,900
I could have prevented it.

466
00:34:38,535 --> 00:34:39,533
I won't

467
00:34:40,125 --> 00:34:41,910
continue to make that mistake.

468
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:45,911
I think you've overestimated
your position, Jack.

469
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:49,032
You can't hurt me anymore.

470
00:34:50,145 --> 00:34:51,140
True.

471
00:34:53,696 --> 00:34:56,680
But I can keep you down here with me.

472
00:35:05,806 --> 00:35:06,962
What are you doing?

473
00:35:07,245 --> 00:35:08,710
You beat death, Arvin.

474
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:12,852
But you couldn't beat me.

475
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:21,330
The glass won't hold you.

476
00:35:21,565 --> 00:35:23,490
Mom, you need to come back.

477
00:35:31,478 --> 00:35:32,473
Mom.

478
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,883
You can make it. Give me your hand.

479
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:38,970
I'm sorry, Sydney.

480
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:46,490
Mom, come back!

481
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:03,661
I can't move.

482
00:37:08,365 --> 00:37:10,421
I don't think there's anything I can do.

483
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:13,970
I can't move.

484
00:37:15,056 --> 00:37:16,060
Well...

485
00:37:16,308 --> 00:37:18,673
as you've said, you have
all the time in the world.

486
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:23,682
Unfortunately, I think
you'll have to spend it here.

487
00:37:27,725 --> 00:37:29,720
Well, at least you're here with me.

488
00:37:38,608 --> 00:37:40,253
No, Nadia, don't leave me here.

489
00:37:58,868 --> 00:37:59,931
Daddy!

490
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:12,202
Uncle Dixon!

491
00:38:16,647 --> 00:38:18,103
How are you, sweetie?

492
00:38:19,947 --> 00:38:21,170
Deputy director.

493
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:24,421
Please, this far from Langley,
you can just call me "sir."

494
00:38:25,668 --> 00:38:26,721
Good to see you.

495
00:38:29,545 --> 00:38:31,312
Did you have a hard time
finding this place?

496
00:38:31,315 --> 00:38:32,232
What, are you kidding?

497
00:38:32,357 --> 00:38:34,811
I had an impossible time
finding this place.

498
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,920
Well, I guess that's sort of the point,
right?

499
00:38:39,266 --> 00:38:40,271
Hello, stranger.

500
00:38:40,638 --> 00:38:42,040
Hello, Sydney.

501
00:38:46,185 --> 00:38:48,361
And this must be...

502
00:38:51,587 --> 00:38:52,641
Hello, Jack.

503
00:38:55,165 --> 00:38:57,713
Marshall sends his best.
He wanted to tag along,

504
00:38:57,745 --> 00:38:59,612
but Carrie’s stuck at home on bed rest.

505
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:02,403
Another baby?
Oh, God, I don't know how she does it.

506
00:39:02,435 --> 00:39:04,371
This makes four. All boys.

507
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:07,763
Well, come on inside.
You'll just have to pardon the mess.

508
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,883
Speaking of mess, didn't someone

509
00:39:10,895 --> 00:39:13,111
promise to finish unpacking
her toys before dinner?

510
00:39:13,386 --> 00:39:14,190
Go on.

511
00:39:14,327 --> 00:39:15,310
Go on, Isabelle.

512
00:39:15,335 --> 00:39:16,723
Can I get you something to drink?

513
00:39:20,878 --> 00:39:24,202
Why do I get the feeling
this isn't a purely social call?

514
00:39:28,137 --> 00:39:30,973
Truth be told, I could use
some field assistance.

515
00:39:32,847 --> 00:39:36,380
A merc team hit the national research
facility in Paris yesterday.

516
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:40,410
I need someone to intercept the seller
and retrieve the hard drive.

517
00:39:41,007 --> 00:39:42,431
Can't you put Rachel on it?

518
00:39:43,408 --> 00:39:46,621
She's on deep cover assignment
in Santiago. I can't risk pulling her.

519
00:39:46,696 --> 00:39:49,081
Besides, this job has...

520
00:39:49,376 --> 00:39:50,841
...sentimental value.

521
00:39:58,828 --> 00:40:00,881
Don't look at me.
You're the one that let him go.

522
00:40:06,665 --> 00:40:08,740
We've already prepared
the mission specs.

523
00:40:08,766 --> 00:40:10,211
Low risk insertion,

524
00:40:10,368 --> 00:40:11,590
simple areas.

525
00:40:11,737 --> 00:40:13,542
Who knows, it could be fun.

526
00:40:14,215 --> 00:40:16,881
That's what you say every time
you show up on my doorstep.

527
00:40:17,578 --> 00:40:20,992
Then next, you know, I'm jumping over
canals and tree and shield while Napalm

528
00:40:20,995 --> 00:40:22,403
explodes around me.

529
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:25,511
Yes. That's how I define "fun".

530
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:29,591
Why don't we finish this conversation
over dinner?

531
00:40:30,367 --> 00:40:32,912
And you haven't lived
until you've seen our sunset.

532
