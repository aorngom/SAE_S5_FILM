1
00:00:01,051 --> 00:00:02,628
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:02,719 --> 00:00:05,720
This was from
a hidden camera that I placed.

3
00:00:06,389 --> 00:00:09,011
This is how I knew
you were alive.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,808
No!

5
00:00:10,894 --> 00:00:13,349
I loved you like a daughter.

6
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:16,474
And even you would admit there
were times, I would see it,

7
00:00:16,566 --> 00:00:19,520
you looked at me
like I was your...

8
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:25,024
Where have I been
the last two years?

9
00:00:25,116 --> 00:00:27,654
I know it was you!
What the hell did you do to me?

10
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:28,859
So, before you tell me

11
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:31,444
you can handle
my coming back to the CIA,

12
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,413
there are two things
you need to know.

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,004
First is that I was so in love
with you, it nearly killed me.

14
00:00:39,089 --> 00:00:41,247
And second...

15
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:44,628
...that I don't regret
moving on with my life.

16
00:00:46,596 --> 00:00:47,794
This is Lauren Reed.

17
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:51,756
She's going to be our liaison to
the National Security Council.

18
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:53,725
If there's anything
I can do to help.

19
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:57,430
You should know I'm also
Michael Vaughn's wife.

20
00:01:58,251 --> 00:02:00,042
That's good.

21
00:02:00,545 --> 00:02:01,576
But the truth is...

22
00:02:01,671 --> 00:02:03,996
You're insane.

23
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:07,041
The truth is --

24
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:10,255
- Oh, the truth.
- The ever-evasive truth.

25
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:14,558
Is that there are advantages to
losing all your stuff in a fire.

26
00:02:14,642 --> 00:02:15,389
How's that?

27
00:02:15,477 --> 00:02:17,683
To dying and coming back
to life.

28
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,146
No.
I'm good. I'm good.

29
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,140
Okay, alright, a little one.

30
00:02:21,232 --> 00:02:23,391
Think about it.
All the paper.

31
00:02:23,485 --> 00:02:25,691
Clippings from
high school and yearbooks

32
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:28,067
and sweaters I was never
gonna wear again.

33
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:31,691
And pictures and picture frames.

34
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,702
Yeah, but there's got to be
something you had that you loved

35
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:37,575
that it kills you that
you don't have it anymore.

36
00:02:42,504 --> 00:02:43,749
I mean, like a thing.

37
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:45,167
Like a thing.

38
00:02:45,256 --> 00:02:47,463
I know what you mean.

39
00:02:50,053 --> 00:02:53,801
I used to have a first-edition
"Alice in Wonderland."

40
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,595
My mother gave it to me
for my fifth birthday.

41
00:02:56,684 --> 00:03:00,813
Despite my roller-coaster
relationship with her,

42
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:03,684
wherever she is,

43
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:07,689
that was one of the things
that I sort of loved.

44
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:13,575
This is it.

45
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,826
The bar is closing.

46
00:03:16,913 --> 00:03:19,451
Last drink.

47
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,538
The elephant in the room.

48
00:03:25,255 --> 00:03:26,001
Which one?

49
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:27,583
Come on.
Tomorrow.

50
00:03:27,674 --> 00:03:29,251
You and Vaughn working together.

51
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:30,172
With Lauren.

52
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,422
With Vaughn's wife, yes.

53
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:34,084
And let me just say
for the record,

54
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,098
I'm gonna be your friend, and
if you need someone to talk to,

55
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:39,639
or you need
a shoulder to cry on,

56
00:03:39,728 --> 00:03:41,305
I just want to be there for you.

57
00:03:41,396 --> 00:03:44,065
Oh, tomorrow's gonna be fine.

58
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,768
Damn it.

59
00:04:22,145 --> 00:04:23,520
Hi.

60
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:24,850
Hi.

61
00:04:24,939 --> 00:04:26,054
You've met Lauren?

62
00:04:26,149 --> 00:04:27,477
- Yes.
- Hi.

63
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:28,978
Hello again.

64
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:31,476
Sorry about yesterday.
I should have said something.

65
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:33,445
You had no idea.
I was the one who stormed in.

66
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:36,069
- Anyway...
- It's alright.

67
00:04:38,995 --> 00:04:39,695
Hi.

68
00:04:39,788 --> 00:04:43,203
Listen, I made you a mix CD
of all the most popular songs

69
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,454
over the past two years.

70
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:46,286
Not so you can listen
to all the impossible

71
00:04:46,377 --> 00:04:49,996
bad boy bands they keep
churning out, except for J.T.

72
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:53,126
Timberlake.
That guy can move.

73
00:04:53,218 --> 00:04:54,842
More importantly,
because scientifically

74
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,253
it's proven that sounds
trigger the CA-3 region

75
00:04:57,347 --> 00:05:00,763
of the hippocampus
in the long-term memory.

76
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,510
Thank you.

77
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,768
Awkward.

78
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:16,774
Earlier today,
4.47 P.M. Moscow time,

79
00:05:16,866 --> 00:05:19,571
Russia's early-warning system
was activated.

80
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:22,033
They assumed it was
an incoming missile attack.

81
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,616
It wasn't a missile.

82
00:05:23,706 --> 00:05:26,032
It was a satellite
that had fallen from orbit.

83
00:05:26,126 --> 00:05:27,869
As a result
of the perceived attack,

84
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,416
the Russian President activated
his nuclear briefcase,

85
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:33,174
initiating a countdown
to a pre-launch sequence.

86
00:05:33,258 --> 00:05:36,128
With two minutes to spare,
they attained visual I.D.

87
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,594
and scrubbed the launch.

88
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:41,629
10 minutes later, Echelon picked
up a call from a secure line

89
00:05:41,725 --> 00:05:43,931
between Mr. Sark and this man.

90
00:05:44,018 --> 00:05:45,762
Colonel Boris Oransky.

91
00:05:45,854 --> 00:05:47,811
Dishonorably discharged in '96

92
00:05:47,897 --> 00:05:50,223
from Russia's
Military Space Command.

93
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:50,981
Since then,

94
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,902
he's worked for a privately held
French contractor.

95
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:55,149
It was their satellite.

96
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:56,981
Oransky brought down
his own satellite?

97
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,280
- Do we have any idea why?
- Not yet.

98
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:00,446
But on the phone call,

99
00:06:00,535 --> 00:06:04,615
he and Sark discussed meeting
to move on to phase two.

100
00:06:04,706 --> 00:06:06,366
We've tracked Sark
to Mexico City.

101
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:09,328
We've ordered a team
of local agents to surveil him.

102
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,124
If we're gonna grab Sark,
I'd like to be on that team.

103
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:14,206
It isn't our intention
to apprehend Sark.

104
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:16,375
The NSC believes
we may learn more

105
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:18,674
about The Covenant
by tracking Sark's movement,

106
00:06:18,762 --> 00:06:22,213
in the hope he will lead us
to The Covenant's key players.

107
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,310
That's fine in theory,
except that I guarantee

108
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:28,478
five minutes after that meeting,
we will have lost Sark.

109
00:06:28,563 --> 00:06:29,594
It's happened before.

110
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,441
In the last two years,
our surveillance capabilities

111
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:34,233
have become
far more sophisticated.

112
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,608
I might have missed a lot
in the last two years,

113
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,483
but the fact that Sark is
aligned with an organisation

114
00:06:39,574 --> 00:06:42,860
outwardly hostile to the United
States and apparently Russia --

115
00:06:42,952 --> 00:06:44,495
As I was going
to explain to you,

116
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:47,450
our optical satellite resolution
has increased dramatically.

117
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,118
We have real-time
face recognition.

118
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:52,163
All the technology in the world
can't fix our problem.

119
00:06:52,253 --> 00:06:54,080
It's the people we need to stop.

120
00:06:54,172 --> 00:06:55,714
Sark, for example.

121
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,708
Now, I'm familiar
with the strategy.

122
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:59,710
The CIA employed it
against SD-6.

123
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:01,926
The risks you're describing
have been factored

124
00:07:02,013 --> 00:07:04,338
into our analysis,
and as for SD-6,

125
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:05,926
The Alliance
doesn't exist anymore.

126
00:07:06,017 --> 00:07:08,010
The reason SD-6
and The Alliance broke down

127
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,265
is because Arvin Sloane,

128
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:12,106
a man who the White House
pardoned, wanted them to.

129
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,191
So do me a favour and don't
revise history I lived through!

130
00:07:15,276 --> 00:07:17,316
Alright, enough!

131
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:20,864
Sark was an inch away from
initiating a nuclear exchange.

132
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,404
According to that call,
that was only phase one.

133
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,699
Capturing Sark, although it
might put a smile on my face,

134
00:07:25,787 --> 00:07:28,907
will do nothing
to shut down The Covenant.

135
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:36,079
For the moment,
Sark remains free.

136
00:07:36,172 --> 00:07:40,751
Sydney, Weiss, I want you
to track Sark to that meeting.

137
00:07:40,844 --> 00:07:42,587
Standard
surveillance operation.

138
00:07:42,679 --> 00:07:46,048
Let's see if we can get
some info on their phase two.

139
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:48,098
You leave in an hour.

140
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,135
I hate her.

141
00:07:51,229 --> 00:07:52,640
She's been through a lot.

142
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:55,435
I've been on eggshells for two
weeks since Sydney came back.

143
00:07:55,525 --> 00:07:57,731
Trying not to say
the wrong thing.

144
00:07:57,819 --> 00:07:58,815
I am done.

145
00:07:58,903 --> 00:08:01,608
Sydney Bristow is
self-righteous and arrogant.

146
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,073
She lost two years of her life.

147
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:05,731
She's the most condescending
person I have ever met.

148
00:08:05,827 --> 00:08:07,405
I understand
why you have a problem.

149
00:08:07,495 --> 00:08:09,239
No, she's the one
with the problem.

150
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,410
I am not going to apologise

151
00:08:10,498 --> 00:08:12,407
because I remember
the last 24 months,

152
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,959
or because I'm married
to the man I love.

153
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:14,992
You're reacting emotionally.

154
00:08:15,086 --> 00:08:17,957
No, I'm reacting intelligently,
as I expected Sydney to.

155
00:08:18,047 --> 00:08:20,206
You'd think she'd listen
to someone

156
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,759
instead of just talking
all over them.

157
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:23,882
- She's horrible.
- Okay, stop.

158
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:26,176
This was Sydney's
first briefing.

159
00:08:26,264 --> 00:08:27,343
Give her a minute.

160
00:08:27,432 --> 00:08:29,175
The way things are,
no one would blame you

161
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:31,094
if the two of you
hate each other.

162
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:34,305
But I actually believe that
you will end up respecting her.

163
00:08:34,397 --> 00:08:36,604
You might even like her.

164
00:08:44,449 --> 00:08:46,738
Just remember that I love you.

165
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:52,615
How was the first
briefing with Lauren?

166
00:08:52,707 --> 00:08:53,454
Wonderful.

167
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,867
I'm not asking
because I'm a fan of gossip.

168
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,419
- Tell me how it went.
- Why?

169
00:08:57,504 --> 00:08:59,461
Did she seem aggressive
toward you?

170
00:08:59,547 --> 00:09:01,873
Yes, as I'm sure I did to her.

171
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:02,915
What is this about?

172
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,468
In here.

173
00:09:08,973 --> 00:09:11,464
Now that Lazarey's murder
has been linked to The Covenant,

174
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,967
the NSC has convened
their own investigation.

175
00:09:14,062 --> 00:09:15,011
You think they know?

176
00:09:15,105 --> 00:09:17,430
That you were the murderer?
Not yet.

177
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:20,145
But they've just received some
footage apparently of the crime.

178
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,026
- How?
- Another camera.

179
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:24,567
Security from across the street.

180
00:09:24,656 --> 00:09:26,150
As our bad luck would have it,

181
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:30,570
NSC's assigned this
investigation to Vaughn's wife.

182
00:09:31,454 --> 00:09:32,830
I know what you're thinking,

183
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:35,072
but the longer we withhold
this information,

184
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,625
the more guilty I seem.

185
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,244
The CIA and the NSC are going to
learn that I killed Lazarey.

186
00:09:40,338 --> 00:09:43,043
And when they do,
the NSC will not hesitate

187
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:44,793
to subject you
to every procedure

188
00:09:44,884 --> 00:09:46,794
in order to recapture
your memory.

189
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:48,167
Then let them.

190
00:09:48,263 --> 00:09:50,754
I am losing my mind
not knowing what happened to me.

191
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:52,841
Someone out there.
Someone has the answer.

192
00:09:52,934 --> 00:09:54,927
The techniques employed
to stimulate your memory

193
00:09:55,019 --> 00:09:57,689
are invasive, surgical,
dangerous procedures

194
00:09:57,772 --> 00:10:00,394
that could leave you
with permanent brain damage.

195
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:05,229
That is not happening to you,
not as long as I'm alive.

196
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:07,647
We've discussed this.
You have to stay focused.

197
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,780
You have to do your job.

198
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:12,109
Reintegrating into the CIA
is the only way

199
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:14,777
you're going to get the answers
you're looking for.

200
00:10:14,873 --> 00:10:16,118
I've talked with Lauren.

201
00:10:16,207 --> 00:10:18,283
I told her I might be able
to help.

202
00:10:18,376 --> 00:10:20,832
She's agreed to let me
see the footage.

203
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,201
You'll go to Mexico City.

204
00:10:22,297 --> 00:10:26,341
I'll do what I can to ensure
this remains our secret.

205
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:06,413
Marshall, any luck?

206
00:11:06,508 --> 00:11:07,088
Yeah.

207
00:11:07,175 --> 00:11:10,591
Actually, considering it's
from a Russian security camera,

208
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:11,674
I was expecting static.

209
00:11:11,763 --> 00:11:15,132
Instead, it's pretty good.

210
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,229
Can you loop that?

211
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,781
Yeah.

212
00:11:31,324 --> 00:11:33,862
Freeze there.
Blow up that frame, please.

213
00:11:33,952 --> 00:11:35,280
Sure.

214
00:11:38,164 --> 00:11:39,824
Not enough to make
a positive I.D.?

215
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,161
Well, not like this.

216
00:11:41,251 --> 00:11:43,457
I'm not surprised the Russians
haven't made a match.

217
00:11:43,545 --> 00:11:45,703
Their programs
generate pixel interpolation

218
00:11:45,797 --> 00:11:48,205
based on Bayesian analysis.

219
00:11:48,299 --> 00:11:49,414
Really?

220
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:51,217
Russians.

221
00:11:51,302 --> 00:11:52,465
You can do better?

222
00:11:52,554 --> 00:11:53,882
Me? Please.

223
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:57,138
There's a lot of things
I can't do in life, you know.

224
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:58,719
Smoking a cigarette.

225
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,889
Playing basketball.

226
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:01,353
Oh, chin-ups.

227
00:12:01,438 --> 00:12:03,845
You know, there's always
kids laughing.

228
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:06,609
But I was born for this.

229
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,899
How long will it take you?

230
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:12,400
These eigenvalues are a mess.

231
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,234
Give me 72 hours.

232
00:12:14,325 --> 00:12:16,318
I think I can I.D. this woman.

233
00:12:16,411 --> 00:12:18,949
Good.
Thank you.

234
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,059
I'm gonna kill Marshall.

235
00:12:45,148 --> 00:12:47,141
This is the worst disguise yet.

236
00:12:47,233 --> 00:12:48,692
Oh, viva la revolution.

237
00:12:48,777 --> 00:12:51,350
I'm serious.
Look at that.

238
00:12:52,447 --> 00:12:56,147
Okay, this chip's got
a gig of memory in it.

239
00:12:56,242 --> 00:12:58,365
Or, as they say here,
<i>la memoria.</i>

240
00:12:58,453 --> 00:13:02,036
That's enough memory to transmit
full-resolution photos.

241
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,369
What's this?

242
00:13:04,459 --> 00:13:06,202
What?

243
00:13:06,294 --> 00:13:08,370
Okay, that's bad.
That's double-chin angle.

244
00:13:08,463 --> 00:13:10,502
Not good.

245
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:11,918
Audio's working.

246
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:15,175
Syd, we're here for surveillance
only. Nothing tricky.

247
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,341
Here we go.

248
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:44,828
Sark's here.

249
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:55,165
Oransky just got here.

250
00:14:02,726 --> 00:14:04,006
Retriever to base.

251
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:06,557
Now I'm uploading the photos.

252
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,232
I need to move closer to get
a look at those pictures.

253
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,396
Don't get too close.

254
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:22,326
Careful, Mountaineer.

255
00:14:22,412 --> 00:14:24,654
It looks like they have backup.

256
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:38,258
Well, it appears
they've revealed themselves.

257
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,004
As I told you they would.

258
00:14:40,096 --> 00:14:42,303
The codes are changed
twice a week.

259
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,299
These go into effect
the day after tomorrow.

260
00:14:44,392 --> 00:14:46,136
This is our target, correct?

261
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:47,887
Correct.

262
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:53,980
By the way, I like the name.

263
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:55,527
Medusa.

264
00:14:56,112 --> 00:14:56,776
It's clever.

265
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,606
Images are good, sir.

266
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,240
Okay, we've got it, Mountaineer.

267
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:04,201
Now get out of there.

268
00:15:04,287 --> 00:15:06,659
That woman is watching us.

269
00:15:10,085 --> 00:15:11,413
I think I've been made.

270
00:15:11,503 --> 00:15:12,665
Stay put.
I'm coming in.

271
00:15:12,754 --> 00:15:14,746
Negative.
They've got the exits blocked.

272
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:16,464
You'll be spotted on the way in.

273
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:18,127
If she's CIA,
we should be going.

274
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,760
She might have seen the photos.

275
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:23,379
Then I suggest you make sure
she didn't.

276
00:15:23,973 --> 00:15:27,307
There's a freight entrance
at the back, northeast corner.

277
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,719
You should have
a straight shot out.

278
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:32,887
Come here.

279
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:35,022
Go away!
Go away!

280
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:38,110
Hey, gringo in the poncho!

281
00:15:38,196 --> 00:15:39,987
<i>Señorita</i> in the poncho!

282
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,816
You know who you are!

283
00:15:41,908 --> 00:15:45,194
Reveal yourself,
or the girl dies!

284
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,577
You've got 5 seconds.

285
00:15:47,664 --> 00:15:49,324
4...

286
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:50,874
3...

287
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:53,701
2...

288
00:15:54,462 --> 00:15:55,707
Let her go.

289
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:57,375
I'll let you walk out of here.

290
00:15:57,465 --> 00:15:59,837
I'll be giving the orders,
thank you very much.

291
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,919
Drop the gun.

292
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:05,970
I said, "Drop the gun."

293
00:16:08,184 --> 00:16:10,640
Marshall, pull up her photos.

294
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:14,305
- Mama!
- Shut up!

295
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,226
Don't hurt her.

296
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,564
His earpiece is different.

297
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,329
Marshall, we need
his R.F. signal now.

298
00:16:30,749 --> 00:16:33,703
Sydney, the mission in Thailand.
Chae Son.

299
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,331
Get ready.
I'll tell you when.

300
00:16:37,714 --> 00:16:40,121
Marshall, what frequency
are those guys transmitting on?

301
00:16:40,216 --> 00:16:42,672
Retriever, patch us through
to the R.F. scanner.

302
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:43,923
Kick it over.

303
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:50,308
Okay, now,
your surveillance equipment.

304
00:16:50,393 --> 00:16:51,259
Give it to me.

305
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:53,012
Not until you let her go.

306
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:54,018
No, no, no!

307
00:16:54,105 --> 00:16:56,228
Got it.
418.5 megahertz.

308
00:16:56,316 --> 00:16:58,273
- Can you boost a feedback loop?
- How loud?

309
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,937
- 180 DBs.
- Oh, yeah.

310
00:17:00,028 --> 00:17:01,142
Do it.

311
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:05,574
Please stop trying
to negotiate.

312
00:17:05,658 --> 00:17:07,366
Okay.

313
00:17:07,452 --> 00:17:09,777
The camera's in my glasses.

314
00:17:09,871 --> 00:17:12,279
Give them to me.
Toss them to me.

315
00:17:14,709 --> 00:17:16,084
Now.

316
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,997
Good.

317
00:17:22,717 --> 00:17:25,469
We're gonna walk out of here.

318
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:27,795
You, me.

319
00:17:27,889 --> 00:17:29,798
Almost there.

320
00:17:29,891 --> 00:17:30,840
And the girl.

321
00:17:30,934 --> 00:17:32,013
Now.

322
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:35,302
Mama!

323
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,030
Oransky got away.

324
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:12,422
So we know Sark was looking
at a satellite photo

325
00:18:12,517 --> 00:18:15,008
with a 3-mile radius
centred around the Kremlin.

326
00:18:15,103 --> 00:18:15,933
We don't know why.

327
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,479
We know it has something
to do with Medusa,

328
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:18,513
whatever that means.

329
00:18:18,606 --> 00:18:20,932
When I was at SD-6,
I think I heard

330
00:18:21,025 --> 00:18:23,398
Sloane mention something
about a Project Medusa.

331
00:18:23,486 --> 00:18:24,601
You're kidding me.

332
00:18:24,696 --> 00:18:27,151
Do you know what it is?
What Medusa even means?

333
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,699
No, all I know is the myth.

334
00:18:28,783 --> 00:18:30,906
You know, a woman so ugly

335
00:18:30,994 --> 00:18:33,864
that if you looked at her,
you'd turn to stone.

336
00:18:34,372 --> 00:18:37,041
Sounds like the myth
of my college girlfriend.

337
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,450
She actually dumped me
for a roadie

338
00:18:39,544 --> 00:18:41,453
at a Duran Duran concert.

339
00:18:41,546 --> 00:18:43,373
How embarrassing is that?

340
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,713
Oregano, please.

341
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,673
Syd, come on, don't do that.

342
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:52,678
You weren't dumped.

343
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:54,557
You were dead.

344
00:19:00,273 --> 00:19:03,227
I haven't even asked
anyone how they met.

345
00:19:04,652 --> 00:19:06,728
Are you asking me?

346
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,650
The NSC was wrapping up
the case on your mom.

347
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:12,530
We were all deposed.

348
00:19:12,619 --> 00:19:15,739
Lauren was the one
asking the questions.

349
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,202
They hit it off.

350
00:19:19,542 --> 00:19:21,369
Tell me about their wedding.

351
00:19:22,504 --> 00:19:24,496
It was fine.

352
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:26,214
Her parents' farm in Virginia.

353
00:19:26,299 --> 00:19:28,208
You know
she's Senator Reed's daughter.

354
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,377
No, I didn't.

355
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:31,668
Yeah.

356
00:19:31,763 --> 00:19:33,387
Yeah, they have 500 acres.

357
00:19:33,473 --> 00:19:35,382
It's pretty crazy.

358
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:37,758
Was everyone there?

359
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:40,094
Dixon, Marshall?

360
00:19:44,984 --> 00:19:46,894
She's a good person.

361
00:19:47,445 --> 00:19:53,199
I'm not trying to rub it in, but
I don't want to be dishonest.

362
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:57,822
I should have thought
of it before.

363
00:19:57,914 --> 00:19:58,863
Isn't it obvious?

364
00:19:58,957 --> 00:20:02,290
A prior image model with
3-D surface reconstruction.

365
00:20:02,377 --> 00:20:04,168
Have you made a positive
identification?

366
00:20:04,254 --> 00:20:07,420
Well, no, not yet,
but this is where we started.

367
00:20:07,507 --> 00:20:12,465
Okay, after an application of my
surface-reconstruction genius,

368
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:14,879
this is where we are now.

369
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,809
How's it going?

370
00:20:18,893 --> 00:20:20,803
Marshall's ahead of schedule.

371
00:20:20,895 --> 00:20:22,687
When do you think
you'll be finished?

372
00:20:22,772 --> 00:20:26,272
I'd say maybe noon tomorrow.

373
00:20:28,111 --> 00:20:30,104
Good.
Thank you.

374
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,652
I'd like to feed the image into
our face-recognition database

375
00:20:32,741 --> 00:20:34,235
as soon as it's complete.

376
00:20:47,464 --> 00:20:49,373
Sydney was right.

377
00:20:49,466 --> 00:20:52,632
The Medusa project was flagged
in the SD-6 database.

378
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,257
It's an anti-satellite
pulse weapon.

379
00:20:55,346 --> 00:20:58,300
Once operational, it can cripple
our network of satellites.

380
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,467
D.O.D., NSA, you name it.

381
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,102
We'd be blind
to a potential attack.

382
00:21:02,187 --> 00:21:04,060
That's what's
so genius about this weapon.

383
00:21:04,147 --> 00:21:07,183
It beams a microwave
at one satellite in the chain,

384
00:21:07,275 --> 00:21:09,232
which then relays a pulse
across the network.

385
00:21:09,319 --> 00:21:11,525
You're talking about
hundreds of satellites.

386
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:13,440
Most with classified
orbital rotations.

387
00:21:13,531 --> 00:21:15,275
How does this tie in
with The Covenant?

388
00:21:15,366 --> 00:21:16,446
The man Sark met with.

389
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:17,779
Oransky.

390
00:21:17,869 --> 00:21:20,656
He supervised the development of
Medusa for the Russian military.

391
00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:22,324
He was discharged
before it was completed.

392
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:26,283
He never knew
where it ended up until now.

393
00:21:26,377 --> 00:21:28,951
This is the photo Oransky
and Sark were looking at.

394
00:21:29,047 --> 00:21:32,546
According to the time stamp,
it was taken by a satellite

395
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:34,959
exactly four minutes
after Oransky sent

396
00:21:35,053 --> 00:21:38,054
that other satellite of his
crashing into Gorky Park.

397
00:21:38,139 --> 00:21:40,346
He sends one bird down
so the other can photograph

398
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,971
Russia's nuclear reaction
protocol in action.

399
00:21:43,061 --> 00:21:45,634
What happened was they
thought they were under attack,

400
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,141
so, among other things,

401
00:21:47,232 --> 00:21:50,102
they evacuated several
high-level government officials

402
00:21:50,193 --> 00:21:52,269
to several
continuity-of-government bunkers

403
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:54,354
designed to survive
a nuclear attack.

404
00:21:54,447 --> 00:21:56,356
This is
what Medusa photographed.

405
00:21:56,449 --> 00:21:59,023
See these motorcades
entering the Science Ministry?

406
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:01,360
There must be
a bunker underneath.

407
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:05,155
According to the SD-6 database,
Medusa is stored in that bunker.

408
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,871
And now Oransky and Sark
are planning to steal it.

409
00:22:07,961 --> 00:22:10,368
Why don't we call the Kremlin
and let them know?

410
00:22:10,463 --> 00:22:13,381
The Russians claim to oppose
anti-satellite weapons.

411
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:15,340
They're not about
to admit having one.

412
00:22:15,427 --> 00:22:17,799
Bottom line,
we have to access the bunker

413
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:20,675
and steal Medusa
before Sark gets it.

414
00:22:20,765 --> 00:22:23,054
I'll have Strategic Services
list our options.

415
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:25,219
Meet back here in one hour.

416
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:26,426
No problem.

417
00:22:26,521 --> 00:22:27,896
I can corrupt that image.

418
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:29,938
However, the terms of my parole

419
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:32,231
prohibit me from using
a computer.

420
00:22:32,318 --> 00:22:35,604
You should know that, Jack.
I believe you wrote them.

421
00:22:40,243 --> 00:22:41,274
How's it rendered?

422
00:22:41,369 --> 00:22:42,567
3-D surface reconstruction.

423
00:22:42,662 --> 00:22:44,037
Is the work station
part of a network?

424
00:22:44,122 --> 00:22:45,201
Yes.

425
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:48,326
Okay, well, give me a few days.
I'll see what I can cook up.

426
00:22:48,418 --> 00:22:50,624
I need it by noon tomorrow.

427
00:22:51,421 --> 00:22:55,371
I have an I.Q. of 170, Jack.
I'm not David Copperfield.

428
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:58,548
I'll do what I can.

429
00:22:58,636 --> 00:23:00,179
We have to do better than this.

430
00:23:00,263 --> 00:23:01,841
An hour of running scenarios,

431
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:04,054
and the best we can come up
with is Sloane!

432
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:07,475
Sloane developed a relationship
with the Science Ministry.

433
00:23:07,562 --> 00:23:08,973
If we can get into the Ministry,

434
00:23:09,064 --> 00:23:11,222
we can access the bunker
and destroy Medusa

435
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:12,644
before Sark and Oransky
steal it.

436
00:23:12,734 --> 00:23:14,109
I don't want to be
the voice of dissent

437
00:23:14,194 --> 00:23:16,233
every time I walk
into this room.

438
00:23:16,321 --> 00:23:18,230
I know we're qualified
to make decisions.

439
00:23:18,323 --> 00:23:20,315
But to me,
Sloane is still a criminal.

440
00:23:20,408 --> 00:23:23,113
As we've discussed,
Sloane is a necessary evil.

441
00:23:23,203 --> 00:23:25,491
We need access to the bunker.
Sloane can get it.

442
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,529
If we can use him --

443
00:23:26,623 --> 00:23:28,283
Maybe you haven't been
lucky enough

444
00:23:28,374 --> 00:23:30,912
to have firsthand experience
with that psychopath.

445
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:32,496
- She brokered his deal.
- What?

446
00:23:32,587 --> 00:23:35,754
I was part of the team that
arranged for Sloane's pardon.

447
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,880
None of us are under
any illusions about Sloane.

448
00:23:37,967 --> 00:23:39,711
He was given a pardon
because he provided us

449
00:23:39,803 --> 00:23:42,376
with intel that led to the
destruction of terrorist cells.

450
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:43,966
Of course he did.

451
00:23:44,057 --> 00:23:46,382
He used you to wipe out
his competition.

452
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:49,645
Let me guess. His intelligence
has been accurate.

453
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:51,888
Yes, and the first
slip he makes,

454
00:23:51,981 --> 00:23:53,440
his pardon will be revoked.

455
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:55,185
When's your next
scheduled briefing?

456
00:23:55,276 --> 00:23:57,518
You have regular meetings
with him?

457
00:23:57,612 --> 00:23:59,403
- 12 days.
- Alright, move it up.

458
00:23:59,489 --> 00:24:02,062
See if Sloane can get us access
to the Ministry.

459
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:04,945
I want both of you
to go in as well.

460
00:24:05,036 --> 00:24:07,658
If Sloane can help us
infiltrate the bunker,

461
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:11,116
I don't want to waste a minute.
Is that clear?

462
00:24:25,098 --> 00:24:27,055
Do you mind?

463
00:24:27,684 --> 00:24:29,593
Of course not.

464
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:39,938
This is a difficult
situation for all of us.

465
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:42,318
I'm not sure how exactly,

466
00:24:42,407 --> 00:24:46,239
but I thought we should
at least acknowledge that.

467
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:53,583
No one would blame us
if we hated each other.

468
00:24:54,502 --> 00:24:56,791
But I hope that doesn't happen.

469
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:01,291
I don't hate you.

470
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,844
Or Vaughn.

471
00:25:09,642 --> 00:25:12,098
That's what makes it
so difficult.

472
00:25:13,813 --> 00:25:16,020
Just got intel from NSA.

473
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:18,894
They tracked Sark onto a plane
from Berlin to Frankfurt,

474
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:21,654
only when it landed,
he wasn't onboard.

475
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:25,866
Which means if Sloane
doesn't help us today,

476
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,035
Sark will get to Medusa
before we do.

477
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,614
I'm sorry.

478
00:25:30,705 --> 00:25:32,497
I can't help you.

479
00:25:32,582 --> 00:25:34,824
You work with the Science
Ministry all the time.

480
00:25:34,918 --> 00:25:36,957
How difficult is it
to add the names

481
00:25:37,045 --> 00:25:39,832
of two employees to the guest
list of an awards banquet?

482
00:25:39,923 --> 00:25:42,627
Actually, it's not
difficult at all.

483
00:25:42,717 --> 00:25:43,962
It's what you plan to do

484
00:25:44,052 --> 00:25:46,507
once you're inside the Ministry
that concerns me.

485
00:25:46,596 --> 00:25:49,514
We made it clear that topic
is not open to discussion.

486
00:25:49,599 --> 00:25:51,473
Pursuant to my pardon agreement,

487
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,097
I am under obligation to pass
along intel as appropriate.

488
00:25:54,187 --> 00:25:55,978
However, I am under
no obligation

489
00:25:56,064 --> 00:25:59,978
to assist you or anyone else
to break the law.

490
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:04,442
Now, as you know,
millions of people

491
00:26:04,531 --> 00:26:08,363
rely on the relief
that this company provides.

492
00:26:09,411 --> 00:26:11,118
I couldn't possibly
endanger that

493
00:26:11,204 --> 00:26:15,332
by exposing Omnifam or myself
to criminal charges.

494
00:26:16,751 --> 00:26:19,123
Certainly not with my history.

495
00:26:19,212 --> 00:26:21,335
You've made
your obligations clear.

496
00:26:21,423 --> 00:26:23,664
Now let me clarify mine.

497
00:26:23,758 --> 00:26:26,878
I am obliged to extract
unimaginable pain from you

498
00:26:26,970 --> 00:26:29,924
the moment you are no longer
a valuable source of intel

499
00:26:30,014 --> 00:26:31,425
for the CIA.

500
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:36,137
Personally, I hope
you don't help us out.

501
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:38,471
I've missed you, Sydney.

502
00:26:38,565 --> 00:26:40,308
I really have.

503
00:26:41,443 --> 00:26:43,519
Well, it shouldn't be
too difficult.

504
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:46,067
I'll tell the Ministry
you're high-level donors

505
00:26:46,156 --> 00:26:47,484
Iooking for a new investment.

506
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:49,198
You know where to contact us.

507
00:26:49,284 --> 00:26:51,953
We'll expect to hear from you
within the hour.

508
00:26:52,036 --> 00:26:57,790
Mr. Vaughn, I remember
how close you were with Sydney.

509
00:26:57,876 --> 00:27:00,663
I'm sure you share my relief
in having her back.

510
00:27:02,547 --> 00:27:05,120
Just get us on the list.

511
00:27:31,659 --> 00:27:32,608
Are we on the list?

512
00:27:32,702 --> 00:27:35,158
Under the names Tomas Conterra
and Sabina Milan.

513
00:27:35,246 --> 00:27:36,361
Omnifam investors.

514
00:27:36,456 --> 00:27:37,831
Got it.

515
00:27:38,374 --> 00:27:39,999
Here.

516
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,715
What?

517
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,334
I was just thinking of that
party at the embassy in Prague.

518
00:27:50,428 --> 00:27:52,255
God, that was a good third date.

519
00:27:52,347 --> 00:27:54,339
Yeah, it was.

520
00:27:54,432 --> 00:27:56,508
When you spilled the drink
on the ambassador.

521
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:59,804
What was I supposed to do?
He was staring down your dress.

522
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:08,269
Look how handsome you are.

523
00:28:15,954 --> 00:28:17,116
Ready.

524
00:28:19,124 --> 00:28:20,997
Be safe.

525
00:28:21,084 --> 00:28:22,543
You too.

526
00:28:28,216 --> 00:28:30,007
Dixon's expecting a call
from me.

527
00:28:30,093 --> 00:28:32,418
I'll see you in Los Angeles.

528
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:47,767
It's a polymorphic worm.

529
00:28:47,861 --> 00:28:49,569
Upload it onto the network.

530
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:51,481
It singles out the files
you're interested in

531
00:28:51,573 --> 00:28:54,739
and corrupts the data so the
image can't be fully rendered.

532
00:28:54,826 --> 00:28:55,775
You could kiss me.

533
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:57,067
How long will that take?

534
00:28:57,162 --> 00:29:00,116
I can't say. It depends
on the size of the network.

535
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:02,911
Jack, there is one catch.

536
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:04,993
When you make the upload,
it has to be at a terminal

537
00:29:05,086 --> 00:29:07,873
with administrative privileges.

538
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:27,057
Minister, Tomas Conterra
<i>i</i> Sabina Milan.

539
00:29:45,752 --> 00:29:48,622
Arvin Sloane is an amazing man?

540
00:29:52,467 --> 00:29:54,091
The guards are about
to change shifts.

541
00:29:54,177 --> 00:29:56,170
We have about a minute left.

542
00:30:39,013 --> 00:30:41,220
The guards are gone.

543
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:43,051
Let's do it.

544
00:31:13,882 --> 00:31:16,669
I've got the minister's prints.

545
00:31:18,261 --> 00:31:20,135
The thumb's the clearest.

546
00:31:30,982 --> 00:31:32,726
After you.

547
00:31:46,998 --> 00:31:48,991
The NSC's on a real-time hookup,

548
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:51,409
so whatever we see,
Lindsey sees.

549
00:31:51,503 --> 00:31:53,709
And the face-recognition
database?

550
00:31:53,797 --> 00:31:57,462
As soon as I get the image
rendered, we're ready to roll.

551
00:32:03,348 --> 00:32:05,091
Mr. Bristow,
what can I do for you?

552
00:32:05,183 --> 00:32:06,214
Is Director Dixon in?

553
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:07,684
No, he's over with Marshall.

554
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:09,311
Is there something
I can help you with?

555
00:32:09,396 --> 00:32:10,973
No, I'll just drop these
on his desk.

556
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:12,523
Okay.

557
00:33:08,037 --> 00:33:11,489
Okay, let's see how many guards
are on the control-room floor.

558
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,743
We're almost into their
video-surveillance feed.

559
00:33:17,839 --> 00:33:19,878
What?
What is it?

560
00:33:19,966 --> 00:33:22,920
These are the cameras
for the control-room level.

561
00:33:23,011 --> 00:33:25,716
Sark must already be here.

562
00:33:26,931 --> 00:33:28,924
Oh, God.

563
00:33:29,017 --> 00:33:31,424
He's with Oransky.

564
00:33:32,604 --> 00:33:33,350
Come on.

565
00:33:33,438 --> 00:33:34,387
Wait a minute.

566
00:33:34,481 --> 00:33:36,557
We have no idea
how many men Sark brought.

567
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:38,725
He doesn't know we're coming.

568
00:34:09,891 --> 00:34:12,643
The program will be ready
to render in a minute.

569
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:14,435
You know, I was curious.

570
00:34:14,521 --> 00:34:16,727
Lindsey briefs
the President, right?

571
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:19,685
Well, you think maybe,
assuming this all goes well,

572
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,184
that he could request

573
00:34:22,278 --> 00:34:24,686
one of those little
White House tie clips for me?

574
00:34:24,781 --> 00:34:26,820
Or maybe some peanuts
from Air Force One,

575
00:34:26,908 --> 00:34:28,188
because I love peanuts,

576
00:34:28,284 --> 00:34:31,985
and you figure they'd get
top-quality peanuts

577
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,704
if you're the President.

578
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,032
Oh, wait a minute.
Here we go.

579
00:34:47,554 --> 00:34:49,677
Until Mr. Oransky
gets the Medusa core,

580
00:34:49,764 --> 00:34:51,140
no one enters the control room,

581
00:34:51,224 --> 00:34:54,260
and this entire level
should be locked down.

582
00:34:54,352 --> 00:34:56,843
I need you to secure
all the access points.

583
00:35:21,838 --> 00:35:25,788
Oh, gummy bear?

584
00:35:32,348 --> 00:35:33,759
Find everything you need?

585
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,222
Yes, thanks.
I'm just leaving him a note.

586
00:35:50,658 --> 00:35:53,149
I was wondering
if you might show up.

587
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:56,278
I looked for you
upstairs at the party.

588
00:36:00,043 --> 00:36:01,418
I've taken the liberty

589
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:04,457
of discontinuing
the elevator service.

590
00:36:04,547 --> 00:36:06,706
And unfortunately, Mr. Oransky,

591
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,919
Medusa, and myself won't be
here when the guards arrive.

592
00:36:10,011 --> 00:36:11,422
I'm certain
when they discover you,

593
00:36:11,513 --> 00:36:14,846
the Russians will be
more than hospitable hosts.

594
00:36:22,816 --> 00:36:24,974
I think we got it.

595
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:28,778
There's no way
we can steal Medusa.

596
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:31,105
We can't let Sark
get it, either.

597
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,026
We'll have to destroy it.

598
00:36:33,827 --> 00:36:35,819
We could still
rig the generator to blow.

599
00:36:35,912 --> 00:36:37,786
We do that,
this whole sublevel's going.

600
00:36:37,872 --> 00:36:40,624
We won't have a way out.
That could be an intake vent.

601
00:36:40,708 --> 00:36:42,452
We could crawl inside
and get out.

602
00:36:42,544 --> 00:36:44,583
We might not make it.

603
00:36:46,214 --> 00:36:48,207
We might make it.

604
00:36:50,218 --> 00:36:52,791
I'll activate
the transfer switch.

605
00:36:52,887 --> 00:36:56,303
We'll have the Medusa core
in 30 seconds.

606
00:37:03,398 --> 00:37:05,189
What the hell was that?

607
00:37:06,234 --> 00:37:07,894
Dead generator.

608
00:37:07,986 --> 00:37:09,694
Fouls the control system.

609
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:12,733
They've overloaded
the voltage in here.

610
00:37:13,283 --> 00:37:14,563
Medusa is fried.

611
00:37:17,829 --> 00:37:19,905
We have to go.

612
00:37:19,998 --> 00:37:22,156
No way.

613
00:37:23,084 --> 00:37:26,584
This bitch shot me in my leg.

614
00:37:43,021 --> 00:37:45,642
- What's happening?
- I'm not sure.

615
00:37:46,524 --> 00:37:47,769
It's not rendering.

616
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:51,026
According to the program,
this is as good as it gets.

617
00:37:51,738 --> 00:37:52,568
Sir.

618
00:38:21,559 --> 00:38:23,718
Anything yet?

619
00:38:23,812 --> 00:38:25,851
- Not what we hoped.
- On the picture side.

620
00:38:25,939 --> 00:38:27,314
It's not the technical side.

621
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:28,727
The picture's not in focus.

622
00:38:28,817 --> 00:38:31,023
So no identification
of Lazarey's killer?

623
00:38:31,111 --> 00:38:33,234
Unfortunately, no.

624
00:38:33,822 --> 00:38:35,280
Too bad.

625
00:38:35,365 --> 00:38:36,989
Well, keep looking.

626
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,897
Officially, the Kremlin
denies having been

627
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:13,439
in possession of Medusa.

628
00:39:13,528 --> 00:39:17,312
Unofficially, they've confirmed
that Medusa was destroyed.

629
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:18,569
Great work.

630
00:39:18,658 --> 00:39:19,405
Thank you.

631
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:21,781
Go home.
Get some rest.

632
00:39:25,749 --> 00:39:27,077
I'll see you tomorrow.

633
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,412
- Yeah.
- Good night.

634
00:39:28,501 --> 00:39:30,577
Good night.

635
00:39:44,934 --> 00:39:46,642
I took care of it.

636
00:39:47,979 --> 00:39:49,853
Thanks, Dad.

637
00:39:49,939 --> 00:39:51,731
Welcome back.

638
00:40:15,423 --> 00:40:17,665
It's a third edition.

639
00:40:22,972 --> 00:40:24,799
Thank you.

640
00:40:25,266 --> 00:40:29,513
I was gonna get the first
edition, but it's $40,000.

641
00:40:36,986 --> 00:40:39,026
Anyway, I'll see you later.
