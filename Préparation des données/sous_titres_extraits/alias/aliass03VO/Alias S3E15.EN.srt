1
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:02,918
<i>Previously on "Alias."</i>

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:05,336
Trusting anyone will take time.

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:07,968
You know so much about me.

4
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:10,679
I know almost nothing about you.

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:13,639
I want to...very much.

6
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:16,565
A Covenant official
wants to defect.

7
00:00:16,649 --> 00:00:17,812
Leonid Lisenker.

8
00:00:17,901 --> 00:00:19,644
In exchange
for his extraction and immunity,

9
00:00:19,736 --> 00:00:21,479
he's willing to turn over
everything he knows

10
00:00:21,571 --> 00:00:22,235
about The Covenant.

11
00:00:22,322 --> 00:00:23,781
Believe it or not,
these schematics

12
00:00:23,865 --> 00:00:26,321
are two times scale,
meaning this plasma charge

13
00:00:26,409 --> 00:00:27,607
is only 6 inches in diameter.

14
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:30,489
But it packs a wallop.

15
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:39,629
Freeze!

16
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,255
Give me the bomb.

17
00:01:18,461 --> 00:01:20,917
Out of the way! Hurry up!
Move it now!

18
00:01:21,005 --> 00:01:23,461
Come on! Follow me!

19
00:01:35,937 --> 00:01:38,309
This is way out of my league.

20
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:43,560
Motion sensor.

21
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:47,817
A dedicated board running
God knows how many programs.

22
00:01:47,907 --> 00:01:50,742
There's no way
we'd shut this down in time.

23
00:01:50,827 --> 00:01:54,362
Our best bet is to try
and defuse the motion sensor

24
00:01:54,456 --> 00:01:56,662
and get this off site
in a blast containment vessel

25
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,912
before it vaporizes the block.

26
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:00,040
Can you do that?

27
00:02:04,632 --> 00:02:07,503
I've found the lead
for the motion sensor.

28
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:09,670
I'm cutting it.

29
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,671
It's no good.

30
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:16,348
It's still operational.
It must be looped.

31
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:18,475
What the hell do we do now?

32
00:02:18,563 --> 00:02:21,268
Your guess is as good as mine.

33
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,730
My kid's favourite colour
is red.

34
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,669
The Wicklow National Bank
Building,

35
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:43,999
or what's left of it.

36
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:45,796
Do we know who's responsible?

37
00:02:45,882 --> 00:02:47,756
His name is Daniel Ryan.

38
00:02:47,842 --> 00:02:49,835
This morning
we intercepted a message

39
00:02:49,928 --> 00:02:51,755
he sent to The Covenant
taking credit for the bombing.

40
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:54,931
Ryan's former Royal Navy.
Explosive ordnance disposal.

41
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:56,760
After his dishonorable
discharge,

42
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,010
he went from disposing bombs
to designing them.

43
00:02:59,104 --> 00:03:00,895
He's worked with The Covenant
in the past

44
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,139
and wants to sell them
his latest product.

45
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:04,691
So he displays
their effectiveness

46
00:03:04,776 --> 00:03:07,101
by destroying
a downtown office building?

47
00:03:07,195 --> 00:03:09,152
Actually, Ryan alerted
local authorities,

48
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:10,899
gave them time
to evacuate the building.

49
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,070
A humanitarian bomber.

50
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,910
His goal was to provide
a state-of-the-art bomb squad

51
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,568
ample opportunity
to deactivate his creation.

52
00:03:17,664 --> 00:03:19,491
He wanted the bomb squad
called in?

53
00:03:19,582 --> 00:03:20,614
Well, maybe 'cause he knew

54
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:24,208
there was nothing
they could do, right?

55
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:26,338
The bomb
you recovered last week.

56
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:27,917
I've got that in my workshop.

57
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,667
According to the bomb squad's
voice recording,

58
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:31,004
Ryan made
one significant upgrade.

59
00:03:31,094 --> 00:03:33,799
Anybody ever hear
of quantum entanglement?

60
00:03:33,888 --> 00:03:35,051
Raise your...

61
00:03:37,016 --> 00:03:38,048
No.

62
00:03:38,143 --> 00:03:38,925
Long story short,

63
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:41,225
the theory is
this bomb can't be defused.

64
00:03:41,312 --> 00:03:43,850
Oh, and compared
to his previous version,

65
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,185
it's got twice the yield.

66
00:03:45,275 --> 00:03:47,433
Ryan indicated that
negotiations with The Covenant

67
00:03:47,527 --> 00:03:49,436
will be exclusive for 48 hours.

68
00:03:49,529 --> 00:03:52,530
If there is no agreement,
he will detonate a second bomb,

69
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:54,857
targeted against America,
to elicit bids

70
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:57,987
from terrorist groups
hostile to our interests.

71
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:00,570
But if The Covenant is
interested in making an offer,

72
00:04:00,665 --> 00:04:02,907
he instructed them
to contact him tomorrow night

73
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:05,159
at a pub called
the Black Stag in Belfast.

74
00:04:05,253 --> 00:04:06,284
Our options.

75
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:08,751
Extract Ryan
and force his cooperation,

76
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,672
or get him to do so voluntarily
by posing as The Covenant.

77
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:15,631
How can we do that?
Isn't that risky?

78
00:04:15,722 --> 00:04:16,801
There are variables.

79
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,966
But if our goals are
to prevent a second bombing

80
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:21,763
and to learn who Ryan's
partners might be,

81
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:24,225
the best way to do that
is by gaining his trust.

82
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:26,852
What about Leonid Lisenker,
The Covenant defector?

83
00:04:26,941 --> 00:04:27,807
He's in custody.

84
00:04:27,901 --> 00:04:29,443
He might be able to detail

85
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:31,105
Ryan's relationship
with The Covenant.

86
00:04:31,196 --> 00:04:32,820
For now, we spec out
both approaches.

87
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,400
Sydney, you question Lisenker.

88
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,492
Vaughn, you and Weiss detail
the mission if we go in as CIA.

89
00:04:37,577 --> 00:04:39,570
We'll meet in two hours.

90
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,790
I believe in America.

91
00:04:51,716 --> 00:04:55,002
America has given me new life.

92
00:04:55,095 --> 00:04:57,004
Away from The Covenant.

93
00:04:57,097 --> 00:05:00,466
I was hoping you could tell me
something about this man.

94
00:05:01,935 --> 00:05:05,055
Daniel Ryan
was critical to the I.R.A.

95
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:07,186
when they were
in the bombing business.

96
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:08,851
He's become
an independent contractor

97
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:12,311
since Sinn Fein went
straight year before last.

98
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:17,739
Your cigarettes are for crap.

99
00:05:18,368 --> 00:05:21,488
But I love cable television
in this country.

100
00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:24,249
I am enjoying very much
this picture...

101
00:05:24,332 --> 00:05:27,037
"Miami Vice."

102
00:05:27,544 --> 00:05:30,248
Ryan is selling a new weapon
to The Covenant.

103
00:05:30,338 --> 00:05:33,458
We're considering acquiring it
by posing as The Covenant.

104
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:35,589
For this to work,
we need you to tell us

105
00:05:35,677 --> 00:05:37,337
everything you know about
Ryan's interactions with them.

106
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:38,839
Protocols, contacts.

107
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,801
I was never directly
involved in procurement,

108
00:05:41,891 --> 00:05:44,217
but I did two deals with Ryan.

109
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,350
I can tell you
what he will be expecting,

110
00:05:46,438 --> 00:05:50,850
and that his contact
is Vladimir Androjnev.

111
00:05:52,402 --> 00:05:54,359
How is Agent Vaughn?

112
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,230
When you took me
from North Korea,

113
00:05:57,323 --> 00:06:00,490
I saw a strong connection, yes?

114
00:06:02,036 --> 00:06:05,655
We know the first contact
is made in Belfast.

115
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:06,863
What happens after that?

116
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:08,951
Where's Lauren?
I haven't seen her all day.

117
00:06:09,043 --> 00:06:11,202
She's in Washington.
Monthly debrief at DCI.

118
00:06:11,296 --> 00:06:13,335
Plus a couple days
with her family.

119
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:15,131
And how is the senator?

120
00:06:15,216 --> 00:06:16,248
I like the senator.

121
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:18,418
And how's your marriage doing?

122
00:06:24,142 --> 00:06:25,305
How was Lisenker?

123
00:06:25,393 --> 00:06:28,762
Helpful.
We should go tell Dixon.

124
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:33,357
- What, I can't ask my buddy...
- Marriage is fantastic.

125
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:35,317
Yeah, I can tell.

126
00:07:14,359 --> 00:07:16,435
How you doing there?

127
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:19,314
Who are you?

128
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:28,914
I'm a U.S. federal agent.

129
00:07:28,998 --> 00:07:30,409
In cooperation
with local authorities,

130
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,121
I'm placing you under arrest
for transporting explosives

131
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:35,085
with an intent to kill.

132
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:36,452
You've put on weight.

133
00:07:37,507 --> 00:07:38,882
So have you.

134
00:07:40,051 --> 00:07:42,459
Your friends from The Covenant
aren't here yet.

135
00:07:42,554 --> 00:07:45,590
Come on.
Car's out back.

136
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,222
Alright, come on, move it.

137
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:56,931
There's been a mistake.
I've done nothing wrong.

138
00:07:57,026 --> 00:07:59,564
Tell that to the families
of your victims.

139
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:17,710
Officers down!
I need help now!

140
00:08:33,605 --> 00:08:35,182
We need to hurry.

141
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:37,266
I'm Emma Warfield.
Androjnev sent me.

142
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:38,390
This is not what we agreed.

143
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,726
Not before your stupidity
led the CIA to the meeting.

144
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,445
I don't know you.

145
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,282
Every cop in the city is going
to be here in five minutes.

146
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:48,533
You may not know me,
but I did you a favour.

147
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:56,373
We're good.

148
00:08:56,878 --> 00:08:59,749
Boy Scout to Base Camp.
We've got the package.

149
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,090
That was good, right?

150
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,967
That's called method acting.

151
00:09:05,053 --> 00:09:06,677
I was shot in the neck once.

152
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,423
I can do it again.

153
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:10,424
We've got to move.

154
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,456
According to Lisenker,

155
00:09:40,547 --> 00:09:42,041
Ryan does business
with The Covenant

156
00:09:42,132 --> 00:09:44,373
at the Commodore Hotel
in Moscow, room 305.

157
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,792
I think it would be easier
to sic your father on him.

158
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,128
We have 27 hours before Ryan
sets off another bomb.

159
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:51,049
Our best chance to prevent that
is to let him know

160
00:09:51,141 --> 00:09:52,967
his first demonstration
convinced us to buy

161
00:09:53,059 --> 00:09:54,090
every weapon he can produce.

162
00:09:54,185 --> 00:09:56,095
Us being The Covenant
based on intel received

163
00:09:56,187 --> 00:09:58,061
from someone
we may not be able to trust.

164
00:09:58,148 --> 00:09:59,096
Lisenker defected.

165
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,017
He hates The Covenant
as much as anyone,

166
00:10:01,109 --> 00:10:03,148
and he's all we've got.

167
00:10:05,488 --> 00:10:09,071
- How's the inspection going?
- Good. Whoa.

168
00:10:09,159 --> 00:10:10,736
Lisenker rejected
the fruit basket.

169
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:12,701
Said it would cost a fortune
in Moscow.

170
00:10:12,787 --> 00:10:14,946
Oh, and we need a ceiling.

171
00:10:23,757 --> 00:10:25,666
That's actually
Russian satellite television.

172
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:27,716
I hacked it off
the Dubnovysat communications.

173
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:30,174
Right there.
Now lower it.

174
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,258
Everything is to spec.

175
00:10:32,348 --> 00:10:34,008
The bedsheets
are 700-thread count.

176
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,760
The minibar is stocked
with diet cola,

177
00:10:35,852 --> 00:10:38,224
and the hotel insignia has been
stitched into the bathrobes.

178
00:10:38,313 --> 00:10:40,471
What if he wants to take a walk?

179
00:10:40,565 --> 00:10:42,190
If he does, he can go
as far as the elevator.

180
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,813
Once he presses "lobby,"
we're made.

181
00:10:50,492 --> 00:10:53,409
Okay, we're ready.

182
00:10:53,495 --> 00:10:55,867
You can wean him off
the methohexital.

183
00:11:06,758 --> 00:11:10,590
And now the soundtrack
of our lives.

184
00:11:15,183 --> 00:11:17,259
Here we go.

185
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:41,869
Good evening, Mr. Ryan.

186
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,584
Welcome back to the Commodore.

187
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,701
How may I help you?

188
00:11:44,796 --> 00:11:46,919
You can start by telling me
how I got here.

189
00:11:47,006 --> 00:11:48,251
I just came on duty, sir,

190
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:52,754
but you do have one message
from your attorney.

191
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:53,877
My attorney?

192
00:11:53,972 --> 00:11:57,555
This is how Androjnev is known.
I'm sure of it.

193
00:11:58,268 --> 00:12:00,391
Yes, he called at 6.15

194
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:04,808
to apologise for being
unable to meet with you.

195
00:12:04,899 --> 00:12:06,726
The colleague he sent
in his place

196
00:12:06,818 --> 00:12:11,694
is fully capable of executing
the necessary documents.

197
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:13,573
That is all.

198
00:12:13,658 --> 00:12:15,615
Thank you.

199
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,916
Syd, you're up.

200
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:55,070
You're awake.

201
00:12:55,158 --> 00:12:56,949
That's good.

202
00:12:57,035 --> 00:12:59,074
We can do business.

203
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,868
I do business with Androjnev.

204
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,207
Your product demonstration
in Belfast was impressive.

205
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:08,955
We'd like to purchase
your new weapon.

206
00:13:09,047 --> 00:13:12,048
While I appreciate
your hairstyle,

207
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,968
as I said,
I do business with Androjnev.

208
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:17,722
Do you know what the CIA would
have done with you in custody?

209
00:13:17,806 --> 00:13:20,842
They would have executed you
as an enemy of the state.

210
00:13:20,934 --> 00:13:24,978
Unless you have a death wish,
you will do as I instruct.

211
00:13:25,063 --> 00:13:27,221
These windows have been
made bulletproof with Kevlar

212
00:13:27,315 --> 00:13:28,394
for your protection.

213
00:13:28,483 --> 00:13:30,641
Three officers,
including a CIA agent,

214
00:13:30,735 --> 00:13:32,527
were killed
trying to arrest you.

215
00:13:32,612 --> 00:13:33,727
You're all over the news.

216
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:34,770
Cue the newscast.

217
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:36,656
Patching it into the feed.

218
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:38,615
Roll camera.

219
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:42,411
Authorities...

220
00:13:49,254 --> 00:13:50,748
Police confirm they do have
several leads

221
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,582
and are working to bring
the investigation

222
00:13:52,674 --> 00:13:54,417
to a swift conclusion.

223
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:56,300
Few details have been given
to news organisations,

224
00:13:56,386 --> 00:13:58,841
but a photograph was released
of this man,

225
00:13:58,930 --> 00:14:00,555
who was not only involved
in the raid,

226
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,763
but who police say
was responsible

227
00:14:02,851 --> 00:14:05,721
for the Wicklow National Bank
blast last Wednesday.

228
00:14:05,812 --> 00:14:09,015
The CIA is working with Interpol
as well as local law enforcement

229
00:14:09,107 --> 00:14:12,807
in pursuit of this man
and those responsible.

230
00:14:15,113 --> 00:14:16,358
You will agree to our terms

231
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:18,321
and call off
the second demonstration.

232
00:14:18,408 --> 00:14:20,697
It's unnecessary,
and will only serve

233
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:22,944
to draw unwanted attention.

234
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:29,618
Before Androjnev,
my contact was Pannich.

235
00:14:29,711 --> 00:14:30,707
I deal with him.

236
00:14:30,795 --> 00:14:31,709
Okay?

237
00:14:31,796 --> 00:14:34,168
- It is a trap.
- You know the guy?

238
00:14:34,257 --> 00:14:37,211
The guy's a woman.
I must speak with Sydney.

239
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:39,341
Hello, Sydney, it's Leonid.
Listen to me.

240
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:42,346
Ivana Pannich is dead.
Was killed.

241
00:14:42,432 --> 00:14:45,682
She was killed
in Slovenia last year.

242
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:49,137
You know this. That's why
your handlers were switched.

243
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:50,428
Any other tests?

244
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,895
Yeah. I don't feel safe here.
I want to leave.

245
00:14:52,984 --> 00:14:54,941
You leave this hotel room,
you're a dead man.

246
00:14:55,028 --> 00:14:56,570
You're scared I'll go
to The Covenant.

247
00:14:56,654 --> 00:15:00,189
In addition to being a target
of the CIA, Mr. Ryan,

248
00:15:00,283 --> 00:15:02,774
you are also a security risk
to The Covenant.

249
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:05,621
You have information that
could compromise our operation.

250
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,698
Was that a threat?

251
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,071
I've been threatened before.

252
00:15:09,167 --> 00:15:10,626
It was like a threat.

253
00:15:10,710 --> 00:15:13,628
You leave this room,
I will kill you myself.

254
00:15:18,468 --> 00:15:20,591
There's loads of things
I'm no good at.

255
00:15:20,678 --> 00:15:22,505
Some I'm exceptional at.

256
00:15:22,597 --> 00:15:24,340
One of them is poker.

257
00:15:24,432 --> 00:15:27,137
Ah, I love poker.
Play twice a week.

258
00:15:27,227 --> 00:15:28,057
My friends come around.

259
00:15:28,144 --> 00:15:30,552
They bring their money.
They lose their money.

260
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:32,556
I always win.
Do you know why?

261
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:34,606
I can see a bluff a mile away.

262
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:37,693
Take off the headset.
Do it!

263
00:15:37,779 --> 00:15:39,855
Not when I've got something
that you want.

264
00:15:46,371 --> 00:15:48,909
Mr. Ryan.

265
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,707
You played your hand, darling.

266
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,381
Hello, Daniel!

267
00:16:03,471 --> 00:16:04,882
Androjnev told me
you were in town,

268
00:16:04,973 --> 00:16:07,262
so I took the liberty
of coming over.

269
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,802
Sorry.
Were you going somewhere?

270
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:13,137
I was, yeah, but I can wait.

271
00:16:13,231 --> 00:16:15,556
Do you want to come...

272
00:16:24,826 --> 00:16:27,282
Hello, Emma.
It's good to see you.

273
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:30,869
Leonid,
what an unexpected surprise.

274
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:32,950
You vouch for this one?

275
00:16:33,042 --> 00:16:35,712
Daniel, I know about Belfast.

276
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:38,286
Your extraction was cleared
to the highest levels.

277
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:39,496
Emma saved your life.

278
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:43,540
You should kiss her.
Whatever she wants.

279
00:16:53,646 --> 00:16:55,189
Okay.

280
00:16:55,273 --> 00:16:57,182
The terms are acceptable.

281
00:16:57,275 --> 00:16:59,184
On one condition.

282
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,654
The details for transfer
and materials, blueprints

283
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:04,447
have to be handled
by the co-chair

284
00:17:04,532 --> 00:17:06,074
of the North American cell.

285
00:17:06,159 --> 00:17:08,152
I deal directly with Mr. Sark.

286
00:17:08,244 --> 00:17:09,655
Okay?

287
00:17:11,873 --> 00:17:13,782
You're in no position
to make such a demand.

288
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,081
As long as I've got
what you want, I am.

289
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:19,455
Mr. Sark is in town on business.

290
00:17:19,547 --> 00:17:24,008
For an important supplier
such as yourself, I'm...

291
00:17:24,094 --> 00:17:26,715
I'm sure he would be happy
to oblige.

292
00:17:26,805 --> 00:17:28,215
Happy to oblige?

293
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,714
- Let me explain.
- Explain what?

294
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:32,766
We're not really Covenant.
We can't produce Sark.

295
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:34,097
Sark has never met Ryan.

296
00:17:34,187 --> 00:17:36,180
Are you sure of this?

297
00:17:36,272 --> 00:17:37,138
Yes.

298
00:17:37,232 --> 00:17:40,683
That wasn't a yes.
That was a no.

299
00:17:41,319 --> 00:17:43,988
What I know is
the only chance you have

300
00:17:44,072 --> 00:17:46,444
of getting what you want
is to send someone in there

301
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,988
posing as Mr. Sark.

302
00:17:55,959 --> 00:17:58,995
Mr. Ryan, I'm Julian Sark.

303
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:07,634
They said you was a pretty boy.

304
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,759
When and where
can I acquire your product?

305
00:18:21,276 --> 00:18:23,683
The information you need
is on a disk

306
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:28,025
my associate will carry
aboard Nuage Air Flight 212.

307
00:18:28,116 --> 00:18:30,274
Tomorrow evening's flight
from Rome to Paris.

308
00:18:30,368 --> 00:18:32,859
You'll purchase two
adjacent seats on that flight.

309
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:34,911
And 20 minutes outside Rome,

310
00:18:34,998 --> 00:18:36,825
my associate
will sit next to you,

311
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,459
and the transfer will be made.

312
00:18:38,543 --> 00:18:42,671
It's elaborate,
but at 35,000 feet,

313
00:18:42,756 --> 00:18:44,795
no chance of surveillance.

314
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:48,593
This associate.
How will I know him?

315
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,719
You'll know him.
You've worked with him before.

316
00:18:51,806 --> 00:18:52,885
He's a friend.

317
00:18:52,974 --> 00:18:54,053
Meaning for this to work,

318
00:18:54,142 --> 00:18:56,135
we need the real Sark
to be on that plane.

319
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:58,185
Any ideas how we can do that?

320
00:18:58,271 --> 00:18:59,849
The second demonstration

321
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:03,391
is scheduled to take place
tomorrow afternoon.

322
00:19:03,485 --> 00:19:06,058
I assume it will be called off.

323
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:11,107
When my associate sees you,

324
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:12,611
they'll know we've come
to terms,

325
00:19:12,702 --> 00:19:15,240
and bring that issue to a close.

326
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:18,577
- We're agreed then?
- We are indeed, Mr. Sark.

327
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,580
We know the frequency

328
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:21,993
Ryan broadcast his initial
communiqué over, right?

329
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:23,249
Yes, we intercepted it.

330
00:19:23,338 --> 00:19:24,713
Then to get Sark on the plane,

331
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:27,549
we have to put out a communiqué
from Ryan to The Covenant

332
00:19:27,634 --> 00:19:29,626
which details
the terms he just laid out.

333
00:19:29,719 --> 00:19:30,715
If we can make Sark believe

334
00:19:30,804 --> 00:19:33,758
this is a way to acquire Ryan's
new technology, he may bite.

335
00:19:33,848 --> 00:19:35,259
How much time before he
sets off the next bomb?

336
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,429
Less than 18 hours.

337
00:19:36,518 --> 00:19:38,925
Get Marshall on the intercept.
You work on the communiqué.

338
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,645
I want you on that plane.

339
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:44,064
You played Sark.
Your job now is to shadow him.

340
00:20:02,293 --> 00:20:03,408
The airline database

341
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,081
shows all passengers
have checked in

342
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:08,125
except
a Mr. and Mrs. Clyde Broussant.

343
00:20:19,894 --> 00:20:22,267
Welcome aboard, Mr. Broussant.

344
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:24,644
Would you care for a glass
of wine before takeoff?

345
00:20:24,733 --> 00:20:26,524
That would be lovely.

346
00:20:26,609 --> 00:20:28,816
I've got a 20 on our mark.

347
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,234
I have your wife listed
on the passenger manifest.

348
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,031
She was planning
on making the trip,

349
00:20:34,117 --> 00:20:36,525
but she wasn't feeling
too well, the poor dear.

350
00:20:36,619 --> 00:20:38,279
Cheers.

351
00:20:38,371 --> 00:20:40,530
Maybe this will work out
after all.

352
00:20:58,892 --> 00:20:59,805
Sydney, it's me.

353
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:01,470
Has Ryan's contact arrived?

354
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,479
No, and something tells me
he's not going to.

355
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:06,853
The approach was to be made
20 minutes after takeoff.

356
00:21:06,941 --> 00:21:09,515
They've been in the air
almost an hour.

357
00:21:09,611 --> 00:21:11,687
Tell Mr. Sark to be patient.

358
00:21:14,157 --> 00:21:17,111
Call your partner.
Tell him the deal's off.

359
00:21:18,036 --> 00:21:20,242
Afraid that won't be possible.

360
00:21:24,876 --> 00:21:26,536
- There is no meeting.
- Ryan made us?

361
00:21:26,628 --> 00:21:28,455
I don't think
there was ever a meeting.

362
00:21:28,546 --> 00:21:30,835
- This was staged?
- Yes. The whole thing.

363
00:21:30,924 --> 00:21:32,548
To get Sark on that plane.

364
00:21:32,634 --> 00:21:33,748
We're reviewing
his psych profile,

365
00:21:33,843 --> 00:21:37,093
re-interviewing everyone
who might give us a lead.

366
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:39,054
Whatever Ryan's motive,
he has presented us

367
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,516
with an opportunity
we must act on.

368
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,011
You are to take Sark
into custody.

369
00:21:42,102 --> 00:21:43,975
We will have a team in place
when you land in Paris.

370
00:21:44,062 --> 00:21:45,971
I understand.

371
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:56,605
Hello.

372
00:21:56,699 --> 00:21:57,898
Hi.

373
00:22:00,537 --> 00:22:01,486
I'm a federal agent.

374
00:22:01,579 --> 00:22:03,489
There is a suspect
I need to take into custody.

375
00:22:03,581 --> 00:22:05,704
It has to be done very quietly.
Is there a marshal onboard?

376
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:08,413
No, I'm afraid not.

377
00:22:09,129 --> 00:22:12,083
Is he on the line?
Good.

378
00:22:12,674 --> 00:22:14,465
Tell me about Daniel Ryan.

379
00:22:14,551 --> 00:22:16,342
I read about what happened
in Belfast.

380
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:17,803
That was a terrible tragedy.

381
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:18,919
What do you know about him?

382
00:22:19,013 --> 00:22:22,050
Ryan is a freelance supplier
of advanced ordnance.

383
00:22:22,142 --> 00:22:24,181
He used to be reliably leftist.

384
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:27,804
He supplied causes.
I.R.A.s, Zapatistas.

385
00:22:27,897 --> 00:22:29,557
Now he's strictly mercenary.

386
00:22:29,649 --> 00:22:31,606
- What changed?
- His brother Christopher Ryan.

387
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:33,068
He's the political one.

388
00:22:33,153 --> 00:22:36,853
They used to work together
up until sometime last year.

389
00:22:36,948 --> 00:22:39,404
Christopher disappeared.

390
00:22:39,951 --> 00:22:43,700
The rumour is The Covenant
had him killed.

391
00:22:43,788 --> 00:22:46,991
The Covenant killed his brother,
and he wants to work with them?

392
00:22:47,083 --> 00:22:48,494
Is there anything else?

393
00:22:48,585 --> 00:22:51,420
No.
I'm afraid that's all I have.

394
00:22:51,504 --> 00:22:53,164
Thank you.

395
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:00,426
Okay, Ryan's brother.
Bad dude.

396
00:23:00,513 --> 00:23:03,598
Bombing at the French embassy
in Rabat.

397
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,434
Explosion at the Marine barracks
outside Manila.

398
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,931
And the remains of a Russian
general's compound in Grozny.

399
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:13,934
These incidents are all
at least two years old.

400
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:15,225
Anything more recent?

401
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,858
No, nothing.
It's like he disappeared.

402
00:23:22,202 --> 00:23:24,490
Sloane was telling the truth.

403
00:23:24,579 --> 00:23:27,948
The Covenant
did have this man killed.

404
00:23:28,833 --> 00:23:30,909
Dad, they had me kill him.

405
00:23:31,002 --> 00:23:32,081
What?

406
00:23:32,796 --> 00:23:35,334
During the two years
I was missing.

407
00:23:35,423 --> 00:23:36,882
When The Covenant tried
breaking me down

408
00:23:36,966 --> 00:23:39,754
to get me to work for them.

409
00:23:39,844 --> 00:23:45,052
When they believed I was ready,
they put me to a test.

410
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,677
Kendall later showed me
a picture

411
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:55,350
of the person
he believed they had me kill.

412
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:57,685
He had no identity.

413
00:23:57,779 --> 00:23:59,902
Until now.

414
00:24:02,158 --> 00:24:05,361
If what Ryan said is true,
and Sark has been promoted

415
00:24:05,453 --> 00:24:07,327
to the leadership
of the North American cell,

416
00:24:07,414 --> 00:24:09,287
killing him
on a commercial plane

417
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:13,241
carrying 200 innocent people...

418
00:24:13,336 --> 00:24:16,088
would be
a very public act of revenge.

419
00:24:16,798 --> 00:24:18,126
Oh, my God.

420
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:19,544
Vaughn.

421
00:24:22,053 --> 00:24:23,429
Cheers.

422
00:24:26,307 --> 00:24:27,802
Mr. Vaughn.

423
00:24:27,892 --> 00:24:29,719
Tell me,
you wouldn't happen to know

424
00:24:29,811 --> 00:24:32,895
an eight-letter word
for "arrogant," would you?

425
00:24:32,981 --> 00:24:35,898
Do exactly as I tell you,
or I'll kill you.

426
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:42,606
Right here.

427
00:24:42,699 --> 00:24:44,490
Get in.

428
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:50,070
Doesn't it bother you?

429
00:24:50,165 --> 00:24:52,537
What's that?

430
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:55,081
A bomb maker arranges
for a meeting on a plane,

431
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:56,961
and then doesn't show up.

432
00:24:57,046 --> 00:25:01,258
I don't know about you,
but that concerns me.

433
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,719
Lock this up.

434
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,641
- Yeah?
- We may have a problem.

435
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,016
An explosive device?

436
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:15,891
There may be one onboard.
You have to land immediately.

437
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:16,978
Syd, what you got?

438
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:19,522
The bomb is the size of a CD.
It could be anywhere.

439
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:21,734
Let's try and figure out
how it got onboard.

440
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:24,359
Crew, passenger, maintenance.

441
00:25:24,449 --> 00:25:26,738
Check the plane service records
for the last week, maybe two,

442
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:29,115
to see if there
was anything unscheduled.

443
00:25:29,788 --> 00:25:30,902
Two days ago.

444
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,195
A work order for repairs

445
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:35,374
in the electrical current bypass
in the cargo hold.

446
00:25:38,546 --> 00:25:41,120
Vaughn, talk to me.
What are you looking at?

447
00:25:43,468 --> 00:25:45,377
You better get Marshall
on the phone.

448
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:53,804
- The son of a bitch lied to us.
- Yes, and we lied to him.

449
00:25:53,895 --> 00:25:55,722
The difference is
we were trying to save lives.

450
00:25:55,814 --> 00:25:58,305
Our goals are far less
asymmetrical than we assumed.

451
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,973
Clearly Mr. Ryan shares
our antipathy for The Covenant.

452
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:02,729
Except he believes
we are The Covenant.

453
00:26:02,821 --> 00:26:04,694
A fact we must
disabuse him of immediately.

454
00:26:04,781 --> 00:26:06,489
We must reveal ourselves
for who we are

455
00:26:06,574 --> 00:26:08,863
and take this man
into our confidence.

456
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:13,119
Alright, we have
confirmation from Marseilles

457
00:26:13,206 --> 00:26:15,115
that airspace has been cleared
for an emergency landing.

458
00:26:15,208 --> 00:26:18,494
The second demonstration
he warned us about. This is it.

459
00:26:18,586 --> 00:26:20,709
Ryan must have game-planned
for an emergency landing.

460
00:26:20,797 --> 00:26:22,754
If we can convince Ryan
that Sark is in custody

461
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:24,121
and will be prosecuted,

462
00:26:24,217 --> 00:26:25,676
maybe he will deactivate
the bomb.

463
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,468
Let's do it.

464
00:26:27,554 --> 00:26:28,929
That was DGSE.

465
00:26:29,013 --> 00:26:30,342
Four Mirage fighter jets

466
00:26:30,432 --> 00:26:31,807
were scrambled
by the French Air Force.

467
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:34,133
To eyeball only. No shooting.
Do they understand?

468
00:26:34,227 --> 00:26:36,979
They are confirmed
as a fly-by...for now.

469
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,934
This is your captain speaking.

470
00:26:40,024 --> 00:26:43,607
We are beginning our emergency
descent into Marseilles.

471
00:26:43,695 --> 00:26:45,522
Okay, the bomb
you recovered in Lisbon

472
00:26:45,613 --> 00:26:47,108
may be slightly different.

473
00:26:47,198 --> 00:26:50,650
But it should be similar enough
for me to walk you through this.

474
00:26:50,744 --> 00:26:51,692
What's that?

475
00:26:51,786 --> 00:26:53,280
What? What?
What's what?

476
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:54,616
I don't know.

477
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:57,244
It looks like a thermometer
with a metal ring at the top.

478
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:59,659
Is the liquid rising?

479
00:27:00,378 --> 00:27:02,869
- Yeah. How do you know?
- It's a barometric sensor.

480
00:27:02,964 --> 00:27:04,127
The bomb is triggered
by altitude.

481
00:27:04,215 --> 00:27:06,967
If they plane keeps descending,
it will detonate.

482
00:27:11,056 --> 00:27:13,973
Excuse me.
You need to...

483
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:16,262
Oh, mon Dieu!
What do you want now?

484
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,760
Pull up! The bomb
is rigged to the altimeter.

485
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:20,812
If we go below 18,000 feet,
we're all dead.

486
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:24,018
Marseilles Approach,
this is Nuage 212.

487
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,396
Emergency climb
to one-niner-zero.

488
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:29,479
How long can we stay up?

489
00:27:29,574 --> 00:27:33,109
We have enough fuel for 2 hours,
maybe 2 1/2. But that's it.

490
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:41,625
My name is Sydney Bristow.

491
00:27:41,711 --> 00:27:44,416
I'm a special agent
with the CIA.

492
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:48,050
So today you're CIA?

493
00:27:48,134 --> 00:27:49,628
So...

494
00:27:50,095 --> 00:27:52,052
- Belfast. What was that?
- Belfast was a con.

495
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,427
We wanted you to believe
we were Covenant

496
00:27:54,516 --> 00:27:57,137
so we could acquire
your new technology.

497
00:28:11,825 --> 00:28:14,398
- So this isn't Moscow.
- You're in Los Angeles.

498
00:28:14,494 --> 00:28:16,533
And we know you plan
on detonating a bomb

499
00:28:16,621 --> 00:28:18,329
on Nuage Air 212 as payback

500
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,573
for what The Covenant did
to your brother.

501
00:28:23,837 --> 00:28:25,876
How you doing?

502
00:28:33,596 --> 00:28:35,554
And you?

503
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,594
I defected two months ago.

504
00:28:38,685 --> 00:28:40,642
These are good people, Daniel.

505
00:28:40,729 --> 00:28:43,266
You should listen to them.

506
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:48,897
If you want me to believe
you're Central Intelligence...

507
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:50,232
you've got to do better
than this.

508
00:28:50,321 --> 00:28:52,480
A warehouse somewhere.

509
00:29:11,885 --> 00:29:15,336
Right.
Much more convincing.

510
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:16,841
Mr. Ryan.

511
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:20,300
I'm Marcus Dixon,
the Director of this office.

512
00:29:20,393 --> 00:29:23,643
We now know the bomb
you planted on Nuage Air 212

513
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:24,761
is rigged to an altimeter

514
00:29:24,856 --> 00:29:27,561
and will detonate
if the pilot attempts to land.

515
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,901
I am authorised to make
the following deal.

516
00:29:30,987 --> 00:29:32,778
Disable the bomb

517
00:29:32,864 --> 00:29:34,738
and turn over to us
all blueprints and material

518
00:29:34,824 --> 00:29:37,362
concerning the creation
and production of such bombs.

519
00:29:37,452 --> 00:29:41,200
In exchange, no charges
will be filed against you.

520
00:29:42,499 --> 00:29:45,998
If you really are CIA...

521
00:29:46,795 --> 00:29:49,630
...then the person I met with
wasn't Julian Sark.

522
00:29:49,714 --> 00:29:52,288
No, he was CIA.

523
00:29:52,384 --> 00:29:54,590
He's on that plane.

524
00:29:54,677 --> 00:29:58,461
But I told him my associate
had worked with him before

525
00:29:58,556 --> 00:30:01,391
and could make
a visual identification.

526
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:04,725
You put the word out
to the real Sark.

527
00:30:04,813 --> 00:30:07,482
You let him know
there was a meeting.

528
00:30:07,565 --> 00:30:09,891
Clever.

529
00:30:09,984 --> 00:30:11,395
Full-on genius.

530
00:30:11,486 --> 00:30:13,194
Maybe you really are CIA.

531
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:14,655
Sark is already in custody.

532
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:15,937
As soon as the plane lands,

533
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:17,657
he will be processed
for extradition

534
00:30:17,742 --> 00:30:19,949
and prosecuted to
the fullest extent of the law.

535
00:30:20,036 --> 00:30:21,993
The terms of our deal
expire in 10 seconds.

536
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,081
After that,
what Agent Bristow said is true.

537
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:28,333
You will be tried
as an enemy of the state

538
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,661
and executed.

539
00:30:33,466 --> 00:30:36,633
You cannot let
those innocent people die.

540
00:30:38,596 --> 00:30:40,969
My brother was innocent.

541
00:30:45,186 --> 00:30:46,597
Okay, well, how about this?

542
00:30:46,688 --> 00:30:48,312
We have to keep the bomb
at altitude, right?

543
00:30:48,398 --> 00:30:50,474
Why don't we land
at a high-altitude airport?

544
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,606
The highest-altitude airport
is in Bangda, Tibet,

545
00:30:52,694 --> 00:30:54,983
and that's only 14,000 feet.

546
00:30:56,072 --> 00:30:57,021
Wait a minute.

547
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:58,278
Wait.
Wait a minute.

548
00:30:58,366 --> 00:30:59,777
We can't get rid of the bomb.

549
00:30:59,868 --> 00:31:03,450
We can't defuse the bomb,
but we can trick it.

550
00:31:03,538 --> 00:31:05,780
Air pressure is the force
exerted on a surface

551
00:31:05,874 --> 00:31:07,416
by the weight of the air above.

552
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,956
We need to encase the bomb
in an airtight,

553
00:31:10,044 --> 00:31:11,040
temperature-controlled bubble.

554
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:13,205
To fool the bomb into thinking
we're still at altitude.

555
00:31:13,298 --> 00:31:16,085
But to do that, you need to
remove it from the fuselage

556
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:17,634
and deactivate
the motion sensor.

557
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:20,126
Which the bomb squad in Belfast
was doing when they died.

558
00:31:20,221 --> 00:31:22,510
Well, yeah.

559
00:31:25,268 --> 00:31:27,095
Okay.

560
00:31:27,187 --> 00:31:28,895
Alright, I see four wires

561
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,605
Ieading out
from the motion sensor.

562
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,350
Red, green, yellow, and black.

563
00:31:32,442 --> 00:31:34,518
Can you see which one
is looped to the power source?

564
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,650
Yeah, the red one.

565
00:31:36,738 --> 00:31:39,359
Red one. Okay.
Go ahead and cut that.

566
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:43,775
- No, no! Wait!
- I hate it when you do that!

567
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:45,412
- Is there a suppressor?
- Yeah.

568
00:31:45,497 --> 00:31:46,777
Don't cut it.
It's a false lead.

569
00:31:46,873 --> 00:31:48,664
- Marshall!
- My bad. Sorry.

570
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,371
Find the anti-static wire that
runs through the plasma relay.

571
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:53,335
It's probably wrapped
in degaussed ceramic fibre.

572
00:31:53,421 --> 00:31:56,339
You have to explain this to me
in words I can understand.

573
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:59,425
It could look like anything.
There are a million variations.

574
00:31:59,511 --> 00:32:00,673
Tell me what you're looking at.

575
00:32:00,762 --> 00:32:02,304
I don't know
what I'm looking at!

576
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:05,592
Well, then you better find
somebody that does.

577
00:32:17,737 --> 00:32:19,397
Thirsty?

578
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:42,092
You're angry.
With good reason.

579
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:47,255
The Covenant took away
your brother's life.

580
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:51,637
"Took his life."

581
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:54,018
What an interesting
choice of words.

582
00:32:54,107 --> 00:32:56,432
I mean, personally,
I'd have gone for something

583
00:32:56,526 --> 00:32:57,724
a little bit more colourful.

584
00:32:57,819 --> 00:33:00,654
Like "murdered."

585
00:33:00,739 --> 00:33:01,901
Well, even that's not...

586
00:33:01,990 --> 00:33:03,864
What about "slaughtered"?

587
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,492
Yeah, what about "slaughtered"?

588
00:33:05,577 --> 00:33:07,285
Try that.

589
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:14,490
The Covenant held me captive
for almost two years.

590
00:33:14,586 --> 00:33:17,670
They did things to me...

591
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:20,415
...I will never get over.

592
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:26,133
They starved me.

593
00:33:26,222 --> 00:33:29,722
Subjected me to electroshock.

594
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:32,098
Sensory deprivation.
They used hypnotherapy.

595
00:33:32,187 --> 00:33:33,978
All to convince me
I was someone else.

596
00:33:34,064 --> 00:33:38,144
An operative they created
named Julia Thorne.

597
00:33:40,945 --> 00:33:43,615
I am telling you this.

598
00:33:45,283 --> 00:33:46,825
It may not change anything,

599
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,661
but you need to know that
I understand what it is like

600
00:33:49,746 --> 00:33:52,367
having The Covenant
take away people you love.

601
00:33:52,457 --> 00:33:55,873
They are evil, evil people.

602
00:33:56,878 --> 00:34:00,081
The thing is,
I was luckier than you.

603
00:34:02,258 --> 00:34:04,631
The man I love.

604
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:10,302
The Covenant didn't murder him.

605
00:34:15,146 --> 00:34:17,720
He's on that plane.

606
00:34:18,358 --> 00:34:23,601
Like I said, my telling you this
may not change anything, but...

607
00:34:23,696 --> 00:34:26,448
I swear to you
if you disable that bomb,

608
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:28,656
I will not rest
until The Covenant pays

609
00:34:28,743 --> 00:34:31,032
for what they've done to us.

610
00:34:32,831 --> 00:34:35,867
Please. I beg you.

611
00:34:38,128 --> 00:34:40,286
Don't do this.

612
00:34:50,974 --> 00:34:52,254
I've got Sark.
Talk him through it.

613
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:54,592
Wait a minute.
Sark as in Mr. Sark?

614
00:34:55,103 --> 00:34:58,187
I understand we're looking
for a degaussed ceramic fibre.

615
00:34:58,273 --> 00:34:59,222
That's right.

616
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:02,316
It's clear Mr. Ryan has
applied the best invariation.

617
00:35:02,402 --> 00:35:03,896
Cool.
Can you splice it?

618
00:35:03,987 --> 00:35:06,941
I could, but the dummy wire's
fixed to a suppressor.

619
00:35:07,031 --> 00:35:09,320
I'll have to ground it first.

620
00:35:11,786 --> 00:35:13,945
You're clear.

621
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:29,384
Alright, we have to find
something airtight to put it in.

622
00:35:42,067 --> 00:35:44,225
This should do it.

623
00:35:45,695 --> 00:35:47,569
He needs a phone.

624
00:35:47,655 --> 00:35:49,613
To call who?

625
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:51,241
The bomb.

626
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:52,986
Specifically, a pager.

627
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:55,747
The bombs are wired
with a remote access protocol.

628
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:56,909
I need to dial in

629
00:35:56,998 --> 00:35:59,667
and enter
a deactivation sequence.

630
00:36:05,715 --> 00:36:07,589
This is Director Dixon.

631
00:36:07,675 --> 00:36:10,166
Get me a secure line.

632
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,846
Keep it steady.

633
00:36:27,195 --> 00:36:28,689
Yeah?

634
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,567
Listen, Vaughn, we may have
a way out of this.

635
00:36:31,658 --> 00:36:32,571
594...

636
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:35,944
How will they know when
the bomb has been deactivated?

637
00:36:36,037 --> 00:36:38,409
The red light on the detonator
will turn green.

638
00:36:38,498 --> 00:36:40,407
477...

639
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,374
Vaughn, watch the light
on the detonator.

640
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,658
It should change colour.

641
00:36:43,753 --> 00:36:45,164
Got it.

642
00:36:45,255 --> 00:36:47,543
459...

643
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:51,083
And now punch in 1124.

644
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:53,466
My brother's birthday.

645
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:57,759
Vaughn, what's going on?

646
00:36:57,851 --> 00:36:59,261
Nothing.
It's still red.

647
00:37:04,357 --> 00:37:07,394
Syd, he screwed us.

648
00:37:09,612 --> 00:37:11,854
Oh, my God.

649
00:37:11,948 --> 00:37:13,146
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

650
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:15,483
Oh, my God! Oh!

651
00:37:15,577 --> 00:37:17,450
Damn it!

652
00:37:20,248 --> 00:37:22,371
Okay, first of all, I didn't
touch anything, I swear.

653
00:37:22,459 --> 00:37:23,454
The bomb's been activated.

654
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:26,081
- We know. We spoke to Vaughn.
- Not on the plane. In my office.

655
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:29,207
The bomb in my office has been
activated. It's counting down.

656
00:37:29,299 --> 00:37:31,457
Ivana Pannich,
my former handler,

657
00:37:31,551 --> 00:37:33,840
confessed to me on the day
before she was killed

658
00:37:33,928 --> 00:37:36,170
that my brother had been
murdered by The Covenant,

659
00:37:36,264 --> 00:37:39,348
and that it was
a test of loyalty

660
00:37:39,434 --> 00:37:42,470
for a woman named Julia Thorne.

661
00:37:45,482 --> 00:37:48,151
You killed my brother.

662
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:50,061
Establish a backup connection
with Langley.

663
00:37:50,153 --> 00:37:52,644
I want all non-essentials
removed now.

664
00:37:52,739 --> 00:37:54,945
We have three minutes
to reach safe distance.

665
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,361
I want this to be
smooth and orderly.

666
00:37:56,451 --> 00:37:58,325
If the bombs were activated
by a phone call,

667
00:37:58,411 --> 00:37:59,822
the detonator must be
on a cellular network.

668
00:37:59,913 --> 00:38:01,989
If I can find the right signal,
I might be able

669
00:38:02,082 --> 00:38:04,407
to reverse-engineer
the deactivation protocol.

670
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:07,870
- How much time?
- 3 1/2 minutes.

671
00:38:07,962 --> 00:38:09,160
I'll oversee transport
of the prisoner.

672
00:38:09,255 --> 00:38:11,165
Dixon needs your help
evacuating the Rotunda.

673
00:38:11,257 --> 00:38:12,716
Now!

674
00:38:17,472 --> 00:38:18,931
Don't tell me.

675
00:38:19,015 --> 00:38:21,387
We've come to the point where
you coerce me into cooperating.

676
00:38:21,476 --> 00:38:23,765
Not exactly.

677
00:38:30,443 --> 00:38:33,610
In seven seconds,
you will begin to see spots.

678
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:35,239
You'll think it's a white light.

679
00:38:35,323 --> 00:38:37,363
But I'm here to tell you

680
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:40,321
the last words
I want you to hear ever!

681
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:42,072
There is no white light.

682
00:38:42,163 --> 00:38:44,654
Not for people like you.

683
00:38:51,506 --> 00:38:52,537
God, what have you done?

684
00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:53,711
Get the defibrillator.
Hurry.

685
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,255
I put it outside the door.

686
00:38:58,388 --> 00:39:00,179
He thinks
he was prepared to die.

687
00:39:00,265 --> 00:39:01,973
We'll see about that.

688
00:39:02,058 --> 00:39:04,134
Charge it to 200.

689
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:05,805
You've got to start at 150.

690
00:39:05,895 --> 00:39:08,386
No time for that.
200 now.

691
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,941
1, 2, 3.

692
00:39:14,446 --> 00:39:16,569
1, 2, 3!

693
00:39:21,244 --> 00:39:25,289
You give us the code
that disarms both bombs,

694
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:27,366
or we do that all over again.

695
00:39:27,459 --> 00:39:30,210
Both bombs.

696
00:39:33,715 --> 00:39:37,250
- Vaughn, we have the code!
- Only 10 seconds left!

697
00:39:45,477 --> 00:39:48,228
- Did it work?
- Yeah, it worked.

698
00:39:48,313 --> 00:39:50,602
That's impressive.

699
00:40:23,306 --> 00:40:25,631
French DGSE have Sark
in custody.

700
00:40:25,725 --> 00:40:28,596
They're coordinating with our
State Department on extradition.

701
00:40:28,686 --> 00:40:29,516
Is Vaughn overseeing?

702
00:40:29,604 --> 00:40:31,727
He's boarded a plane to the U.S.

703
00:40:31,815 --> 00:40:33,439
