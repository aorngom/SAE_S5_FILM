1
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:28,467
Hi, Mom.

2
00:00:28,756 --> 00:00:31,161
Yeah, my date ended early so
I thought I'd give you a call.

3
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,966
Mom, with you if it ends too late,
I'm going too fast.

4
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:39,605
If it ends too early,
I've driven him away.

5
00:00:40,121 --> 00:00:42,320
You know what?
We just didn't fit, okay?

6
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:46,855
No, I did not hit him.

7
00:00:47,926 --> 00:00:50,160
He was one of those guys, you know?

8
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,686
He held the door
and he pulled out the chair.

9
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,777
Mom, he tried to read me the menu.

10
00:00:58,784 --> 00:01:00,455
You know what? I don't need help.

11
00:01:00,821 --> 00:01:01,892
I'm not blind.

12
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:06,018
Yet.

13
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:25,069
You know my desire...

14
00:01:27,586 --> 00:01:29,154
and you may have your price.

15
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:32,817
Was that a 'yes'?

16
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:35,439
I don't know.
Savage Garden? Fun House?

17
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:37,082
The Bovine?

18
00:01:37,561 --> 00:01:38,744
Yeah, we'll do the Bovine.

19
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:41,882
Okay, you choose then.

20
00:01:46,878 --> 00:01:47,885
What?

21
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:50,407
Sorry, I thought I heard something.

22
00:01:53,004 --> 00:01:54,018
There's some guy.

23
00:01:54,059 --> 00:01:55,666
He's wearing
a black cape or something.

24
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:58,065
Cool. He looks like the freakin'
Prince of Darkness.

25
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,152
Mom, something's come up.
I gotta go.

26
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:23,002
Yeah, I love you too.

27
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:24,452
Mom, I gotta go!

31
00:03:33,864 --> 00:03:36,907
It'll just be a few more minutes, ma'am.
Detectives are on their way and...

32
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:38,193
want to ask you a few questions.

33
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:39,613
All right.
Who's catching tonight?

34
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:40,912
Detectives Celluci and Graham.

35
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:44,012
Had to be Celluci, huh?

36
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:45,749
Vicki!

37
00:03:48,444 --> 00:03:49,789
What the hell are you doing here?

38
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:51,430
Uh, almost getting myself killed

39
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:53,392
trying to stop a homicide.
Hi to you, too.

40
00:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,587
Dave Graham, Vicki Nelson.

41
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:58,916
Hi. You're a legend.

42
00:03:59,179 --> 00:04:01,074
I mean, he's burned through
a lot of partners.

43
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:02,894
Yeah, how much longer
are you going to last?

44
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,424
Listen, why don't you see if they've
been able to lift any prints, will you?

45
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:10,485
You look nice.
You dress for work these days?

46
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,284
I just came from a wedding.
Don't start with me, okay?

47
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:17,463
Well, if you can't close cases
you might as well look good.

48
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:19,360
Well, thank you.
You look good, too.

49
00:04:20,271 --> 00:04:21,994
So, what did you see?

50
00:04:23,045 --> 00:04:26,332
I saw someone big, and dark.

51
00:04:26,632 --> 00:04:28,180
It looked like
he was wearing a cape.

52
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:29,941
Tossed the kid around like a doll

53
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:31,941
and then disappeared
into that alcove there.

54
00:04:32,631 --> 00:04:33,940
What do you mean 'disappeared'?

55
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,711
What, do you need a Websters?
I mean he went in and didn't come out.

56
00:04:36,712 --> 00:04:38,655
I...I saw from across the street,

57
00:04:39,073 --> 00:04:40,941
came over to try and stop it.

58
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:43,262
So, let me get this straight.

59
00:04:43,807 --> 00:04:44,812
no weapon,

60
00:04:44,849 --> 00:04:46,774
no backup, no idea
really what's going on.

61
00:04:46,793 --> 00:04:48,670
Plus you can hardly see. So...

62
00:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,993
What, you turn PI and
forgot everything you ever knew?

63
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:53,368
No, I did forget
how ignorant you can sound.

64
00:04:53,369 --> 00:04:54,462
What would you have done?

65
00:04:54,463 --> 00:04:56,771
Well, I certainly wouldn't
have got myself almost killed

66
00:04:56,772 --> 00:04:58,538
trying to prove
I'm some kind of superhero.

67
00:04:58,795 --> 00:04:59,949
Oh, That's good, Mike.

68
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:01,959
You know what?
You should go into psychoanalysis.

69
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,445
Oh, well, shoot me for caring, Vicki.

70
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:06,417
Okay, I'm good. All right?
Settled?

71
00:05:06,521 --> 00:05:07,525
I'm all good.

72
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:09,779
You're not going to
shoot him again, are you?

73
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,147
That was an accident.

74
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:13,572
Mike?

75
00:05:15,902 --> 00:05:17,320
It doesn't look like a robbery.

76
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:18,802
The money and wallet are still there.

77
00:05:18,803 --> 00:05:22,102
The wounds on his neck make it look like
somebody came after him with a chainsaw.

78
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,336
- It also looks like he's been bled out.
- Bled out where?

79
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:27,626
Well, a few drops
leading down the alley...

80
00:05:27,955 --> 00:05:29,420
A couple more down the alcove.

81
00:05:29,476 --> 00:05:30,594
It's a dead end from there.

82
00:05:31,515 --> 00:05:32,987
Yeah, it's just like the other one.

83
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,670
What other one?

84
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:39,029
The other one
that's also police business.

85
00:05:39,825 --> 00:05:42,681
Well, I'm the primary witness.
I think I deserve a little information.

86
00:05:42,682 --> 00:05:44,291
Just like you went out of your way

87
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:46,710
to inform your witnesses
when you were on the job, right?

88
00:05:47,855 --> 00:05:49,639
I cannot believe
you are shutting me out.

89
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,448
I can't believe
you walked away from the job

90
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:52,972
and expect to be treated like a cop.

91
00:05:53,977 --> 00:05:56,006
Then I guess I'll just leave
this up to the um...

92
00:05:56,364 --> 00:05:58,148
- professionals.
- Yeah, you do that.

93
00:05:58,176 --> 00:05:59,594
Well, it was nice meeting you.

94
00:06:02,234 --> 00:06:03,239
What?

95
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:14,016
Hi, Mr. Chan?

96
00:06:14,144 --> 00:06:15,282
Hi, my name is Vicki Nelson.

97
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,485
I'm an investigator working
for a lawyer in Hongkong.

98
00:06:17,873 --> 00:06:20,612
Yes, I was wondering, do you remember
an uncle named Chi Fung Chan?

99
00:06:22,326 --> 00:06:23,641
Okay. Sorry to bother you.

100
00:06:27,784 --> 00:06:28,788
Can I help you?

101
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,495
The papers say you
were there last night.

102
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:31,727
You saw Ian's murder.

103
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:35,692
You know what? If you're some kind
of graveyard groupie...

104
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:37,288
My name is Coreen Fennel.

105
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:39,692
Ian was my boyfriend.

106
00:06:40,482 --> 00:06:42,407
I was on the phone
with him when it happened.

107
00:06:42,867 --> 00:06:43,975
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:45,731
What can I do for you?

109
00:06:46,999 --> 00:06:48,126
He saw something.

110
00:06:48,464 --> 00:06:49,675
He saw who killed him?

111
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,326
You should be telling
this to the police.

112
00:06:52,327 --> 00:06:53,331
I did.

113
00:06:53,932 --> 00:06:54,993
They won't believe me.

114
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:57,070
I need somebody who will.

115
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:00,366
Well, what exactly
do you need people to believe?

116
00:07:03,597 --> 00:07:05,719
Ian was killed
by a Walker of the Night,

117
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:07,851
a vampire.

118
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:12,952
Coreen, I understand...

119
00:07:13,092 --> 00:07:14,482
Don't patronize me.

120
00:07:14,961 --> 00:07:15,966
They're real.

121
00:07:16,247 --> 00:07:17,252
Out there.

122
00:07:17,571 --> 00:07:18,764
Walking the night.

123
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:21,901
Looking to slake
their unquenchable thirst.

124
00:07:22,244 --> 00:07:25,070
Feeding on us the way
we feed on cows or chickens.

125
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:26,417
Chickens?

126
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:27,591
Ian told me what he saw.

127
00:07:28,431 --> 00:07:30,178
He said it was
a guy wearing a black cape.

128
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:33,118
The police tried to hide it from me,

129
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,019
but it was in the
paper this morning.

130
00:07:35,969 --> 00:07:37,306
Whatever killed him,

131
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:39,278
took all of his blood.

132
00:07:40,583 --> 00:07:42,674
You know what? I'm sure
when they find who did this

133
00:07:42,683 --> 00:07:44,383
there will be
a reasonable explanation...

134
00:07:44,384 --> 00:07:47,721
They won't find him because they're not
looking for what really killed him.

135
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:49,343
It was a vampire.

136
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:50,723
I know it.

137
00:07:52,582 --> 00:07:53,587
I can pay you.

138
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:55,699
I've got a job at the University Pub.

139
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,823
It wasn't a human
that killed Ian, Miss Nelson.

140
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,481
You were there. You must know that.

141
00:08:14,778 --> 00:08:16,792
You know what? All I know is
that whoever did it,

142
00:08:16,793 --> 00:08:18,933
was big and they wore black.

143
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:20,820
If it's not a vampire, fine.

144
00:08:21,327 --> 00:08:23,242
I just need somebody
to investigate it.

145
00:08:26,538 --> 00:08:27,552
Please.

146
00:08:29,911 --> 00:08:31,840
I don't want to waste
your time or your money,

147
00:08:31,841 --> 00:08:33,636
so I'll put a few days into it.
That's it.

148
00:08:34,382 --> 00:08:35,626
Okay, it's, um...

149
00:08:36,086 --> 00:08:38,114
500 per day, plus expenses.

150
00:08:39,073 --> 00:08:41,217
Just don't put too much hope
into this, okay?

151
00:08:41,218 --> 00:08:42,907
It may not turn out
to be what you think.

152
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:55,947
That...was...

153
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:57,524
delicious.

154
00:08:57,543 --> 00:08:58,829
You have no idea.

155
00:09:00,012 --> 00:09:02,840
From your graphic novels
I thought you'd be dark and...

156
00:09:03,347 --> 00:09:04,577
angry.

157
00:09:05,197 --> 00:09:06,868
I never figured you for a lover.

158
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:09,281
Passion is at the centre of my work.

159
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:11,865
There's nothing else worth living for.

160
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:14,400
Ah, you're smooth.

161
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:16,719
I bet you'll even say you'll call me.

162
00:09:17,941 --> 00:09:20,918
You know it's sad to see someone
so young be so...

163
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:22,251
cynical.

164
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:23,679
Yeah.

165
00:09:23,885 --> 00:09:25,857
Like you're all of 23.

166
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:28,815
Looks can be deceiving.

167
00:09:31,787 --> 00:09:33,233
Hey, what are you doing?

168
00:09:34,635 --> 00:09:36,175
I thought we could play some more.

169
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:38,654
It's late.

170
00:09:39,021 --> 00:09:40,170
You should go home.

171
00:09:41,351 --> 00:09:44,045
Well, I could... just sleep here.

172
00:09:47,944 --> 00:09:49,643
You have a very busy day tomorrow.

173
00:09:50,451 --> 00:09:51,577
You should go.

174
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,408
Man. What was I thinking?

175
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:57,551
Tomorrow's crazy. I should...

176
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,270
I should go home.

177
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:04,509
Good night, Sandra.

178
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,189
Good evening, Mr. Fitzroy.

179
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,274
You been following
the excitement in the news?

180
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:24,879
I avoid it whenever possible.

181
00:10:24,898 --> 00:10:26,344
It's all about the vampire.

182
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,363
Two killings already

183
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,292
Not a drop of blood
left in either of them.

184
00:10:30,376 --> 00:10:32,738
- Just like in the movies, huh?
- Just like in the movies.

185
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:34,710
Vampires are a myth!
The people who write this

186
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:36,409
and the people
who read this are idiots!

187
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:38,627
Yeah. I guess.

188
00:10:40,177 --> 00:10:41,435
They play on people's fears.

189
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:44,072
You'd think
reporters would stick to the facts.

190
00:10:44,073 --> 00:10:45,092
You can keep that.

191
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,045
Do you believe this?

192
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:49,456
No.

193
00:10:50,404 --> 00:10:51,409
Good.

194
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:20,158
Hey!

195
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:22,932
Hey, excuse me!

196
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:25,100
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

197
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:41,650
You understand I wouldn't normally
share this kind of information

198
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:43,143
outside the police force,

199
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:46,929
but there are times when
we must rise above the rigidities

200
00:12:46,957 --> 00:12:48,647
of conventional ethics.

201
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,793
Solving this young fellow's
murder is all that's important now.

202
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:53,276
Amen to that.

203
00:12:54,152 --> 00:12:57,185
Whoever did this did not care
about the extra marks for neatness.

204
00:12:57,288 --> 00:12:59,486
Please. Not in front of the client.

205
00:12:59,495 --> 00:13:01,618
- I don't think he'll mind.
- Just because he's dead

206
00:13:01,619 --> 00:13:03,326
doesn't mean he doesn't have feelings.

207
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:05,101
Most are more sensitive than the living.

208
00:13:06,542 --> 00:13:08,649
What do you think caused
these marks on his neck?

209
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,208
Frankly, I haven't a clue.

210
00:13:11,816 --> 00:13:14,220
Celluci said there was another
victim killed the same way.

211
00:13:15,318 --> 00:13:16,323
Yes.

212
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:19,346
With both, the wounds
are jagged and uneven.

213
00:13:19,619 --> 00:13:20,623
Like from teeth.

214
00:13:21,163 --> 00:13:22,572
Like from teeth.

215
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:25,165
But whatever did
the cutting was razor sharp.

216
00:13:25,174 --> 00:13:28,132
It cut right through skin,
muscle and cartilage in one fell swoop.

217
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,019
No animal can do that.

218
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:32,545
- What about the blood?
- Exactly.

219
00:13:32,658 --> 00:13:33,747
What about the blood?

220
00:13:33,869 --> 00:13:35,831
Both victims were drained nearly dry.

221
00:13:36,258 --> 00:13:37,263
That's unnatural.

222
00:13:38,599 --> 00:13:39,827
And what do you think this is?

223
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:41,837
I found it in a crack in the wall,

224
00:13:41,856 --> 00:13:43,434
near where I lost sight of the killer.

225
00:13:43,584 --> 00:13:46,006
I know what I think it is
but I need confirmation.

226
00:13:47,668 --> 00:13:48,675
Blood.

227
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:51,322
Most certainly blood.

228
00:13:58,361 --> 00:13:59,826
Ah, yes.

229
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,291
Now whether or not
it's from my young friend

230
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,629
I can't say until I do more testing.

231
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:07,603
Maybe I should ask him.

232
00:14:08,927 --> 00:14:09,931
I'm kidding.

233
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:11,762
Just let me know.

234
00:14:15,135 --> 00:14:16,140
Look familiar?

235
00:14:27,424 --> 00:14:28,588
Hey, Norman.

236
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:31,717
You said you were gonna show up
at the Everquest Tournament last night.

237
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:33,452
We had eight computers
networked at once.

238
00:14:33,461 --> 00:14:34,757
It was freakin' awesome.

239
00:14:35,932 --> 00:14:36,951
I was busy.

240
00:14:36,952 --> 00:14:39,362
I have better things to do
than hang out with undergrads.

241
00:14:39,363 --> 00:14:40,438
Right,

242
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:42,279
'cause your social
life is such a whirl.

243
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:43,848
Something like that, yeah.

244
00:14:44,176 --> 00:14:45,220
What? You got a date?

245
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,295
I might have.

246
00:14:47,296 --> 00:14:49,507
Doing math tutoring for girl
in the cheerleading squad

247
00:14:49,508 --> 00:14:51,090
is not considered a date, all right?

248
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:54,109
I'm doing some stuff,
some serious stuff, all right?

249
00:14:54,128 --> 00:14:56,203
- I'm making some changes.
- Oh, where to start?

250
00:14:56,494 --> 00:14:58,597
Wardrobe? Bank account card?

251
00:14:58,757 --> 00:14:59,808
Personality?

252
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,954
We got another game Tuesday
night if you're inter--

253
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:03,798
Screw that.
I'm not like you guys, all right?

254
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:05,319
I'm going to get the clothes.

255
00:15:05,366 --> 00:15:08,093
I'm going to get the money.
And I'm going to get the hot car, okay?

256
00:15:08,094 --> 00:15:10,312
And I'll tell you another thing.
I'm going to get a girlfriend.

257
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:11,905
A hot one, all right?
You'll see.

258
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:14,065
You're going to see, all right.
Oh. Hi...

259
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:17,684
How's the orange pop?
Do you want another one?

260
00:15:17,787 --> 00:15:18,970
No. Uh...

261
00:15:19,524 --> 00:15:20,528
I'm done.

262
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,445
Say...

263
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:28,209
Here,

264
00:15:29,065 --> 00:15:30,074
take that.

265
00:15:32,433 --> 00:15:33,898
- Thanks.
- No problem.

266
00:15:35,731 --> 00:15:37,252
Dude, where'd you get all that money?

267
00:15:38,501 --> 00:15:39,806
Like I said, boys,

268
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:41,984
things are changing.

269
00:16:17,233 --> 00:16:18,360
Nelson Investigations.

270
00:16:18,493 --> 00:16:19,977
I heard you spoke with the coroner.

271
00:16:20,465 --> 00:16:21,789
Oh, news travels fast

272
00:16:21,808 --> 00:16:23,404
Well, it's a small world.

273
00:16:24,254 --> 00:16:25,882
Did you call to trade clichés

274
00:16:25,883 --> 00:16:27,696
or is there something
you have to say to me?

275
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:29,682
What the hell are you doing

276
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:31,673
sniffing around this case?

277
00:16:32,828 --> 00:16:35,062
You know,
that information is confidential.

278
00:16:35,804 --> 00:16:37,563
That means it's between me
and my client.

279
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,923
What client?

280
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:41,994
Your inquisitive mind,
that's what I always loved about you.

281
00:16:42,748 --> 00:16:44,744
Oh, why don't you tell me
some of the rest then.

282
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:47,543
No. I don't think so.
You're too obnoxious already.

283
00:16:48,736 --> 00:16:51,508
Uh... you know though,
if you're willing to share information

284
00:16:51,517 --> 00:16:53,386
this case could be solved a lot faster.

285
00:16:53,434 --> 00:16:55,611
Oh, I'm sorry. My ears must be
playing tricks on me.

286
00:16:55,621 --> 00:16:57,508
Vicki Nelson asking for help?

287
00:16:58,573 --> 00:16:59,935
That's not what I said.

288
00:17:00,259 --> 00:17:02,052
I said 'share information'.

289
00:17:02,545 --> 00:17:04,178
Well, that's an interesting idea.

290
00:17:05,117 --> 00:17:06,901
Why don't we discuss it over Chinese?

291
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,806
You buying?

292
00:17:11,025 --> 00:17:13,278
I figured you could write it off
as a business expense.

293
00:17:13,334 --> 00:17:15,550
You know, consulting
with the city's finest and all.

294
00:17:57,198 --> 00:17:59,019
You surprise me, my son,

295
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,796
calling me up so soon.

296
00:18:01,077 --> 00:18:04,555
And after all those lovely toys
I got for you.

297
00:18:04,749 --> 00:18:06,138
This isn't like I thought.

298
00:18:08,197 --> 00:18:09,221
I want more.

299
00:18:09,793 --> 00:18:11,446
Of course you do.

300
00:18:11,784 --> 00:18:14,056
And I'm here to provide.

301
00:18:14,113 --> 00:18:15,117
Good.

302
00:18:15,592 --> 00:18:16,765
Good. Okay.

303
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:18,193
Cause I want more money.

304
00:18:18,437 --> 00:18:19,892
I want some new clothes.

305
00:18:20,141 --> 00:18:22,018
I want a car, okay? A nice car.

306
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,088
- Get me a Porsche.
- You know the price.

307
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,441
Blood,

308
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,443
and souls.

309
00:18:27,912 --> 00:18:29,438
Blood and souls.

310
00:18:29,612 --> 00:18:31,593
Fine, fine, whatever.

311
00:18:31,856 --> 00:18:34,562
Take what you need, okay?
But do... just do what I say.

312
00:18:36,834 --> 00:18:40,609
Your wish... is my command, sport.

313
00:18:46,244 --> 00:18:47,246
Cool.

314
00:18:47,869 --> 00:18:48,967
Okay, here's mine.

315
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:54,780
"It is easy to suggest solutions
when you know nothing

316
00:18:55,038 --> 00:18:56,351
about the problem."

317
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:01,290
That's the story of your career.

318
00:19:01,459 --> 00:19:03,835
No, that is the job description,
baby, and you know it.

319
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,544
about the problem."

320
00:19:06,474 --> 00:19:10,737
"The night will be filled with
mystery and budding romance."

321
00:19:11,413 --> 00:19:12,945
I could help with part of that.

322
00:19:13,133 --> 00:19:14,946
You going to fill me
on the murders or what?

323
00:19:14,947 --> 00:19:15,950
Oh, Vick, come on.

324
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:17,710
This is a hot case.
None of it's supposed

325
00:19:17,711 --> 00:19:20,123
to leave the department. You know that.
- Mike, come on.

326
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:22,105
How many cases have we solved over

327
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:23,880
beer and bad Chinese?

328
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,466
Oh, I get it.

329
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,776
You're doing Chinese with
somebody else, aren't you?

330
00:19:30,997 --> 00:19:32,076
It Dave, isn't it?

331
00:19:32,114 --> 00:19:34,790
Yes, it's good old Dave.
You found me out.

332
00:19:37,546 --> 00:19:38,703
God, I miss this.

333
00:19:39,717 --> 00:19:41,473
Ever think about coming back
to the force?

334
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:45,024
Yeah, sure, just as soon as
a miracle happens

335
00:19:45,033 --> 00:19:46,808
and somebody
gives me my eyes back.

336
00:19:46,826 --> 00:19:49,194
Aw, come on, Vick.
It can get better. You know that.

337
00:19:49,195 --> 00:19:50,235
They say that...

338
00:19:50,236 --> 00:19:52,941
megadoses of Vitamin A and E
can make a difference.

339
00:19:53,457 --> 00:19:54,640
No, seriously. It can...

340
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:56,358
increase your visual field,

341
00:19:56,386 --> 00:19:58,292
help with the dark adaptation, right?

342
00:19:58,461 --> 00:20:00,179
Sounds like you're reciting this crap.

343
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:01,496
I googled it.

344
00:20:01,712 --> 00:20:02,716
You googled it?

345
00:20:02,876 --> 00:20:04,219
Yeah, I wanted to know. Why?

346
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,965
All the better to pity you, my dear?

347
00:20:06,394 --> 00:20:08,295
Now, you see,
that's your problem right there.

348
00:20:08,296 --> 00:20:10,050
You never knew
the difference between pity

349
00:20:10,051 --> 00:20:11,664
and somebody
actually caring about you?

350
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:12,713
Oh, is that what this is?

351
00:20:12,725 --> 00:20:15,413
Yeah, and if you weren't so damn
angry all the time you'd know it.

352
00:20:15,414 --> 00:20:17,197
So I have anger issues, too?

353
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:20,050
All I'm saying is that you never
need to leave the force, all right?

354
00:20:20,051 --> 00:20:22,565
With a few simple adjustments you could
have lived a perfectly normal life.

355
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:23,571
I am!

356
00:20:23,613 --> 00:20:25,831
Okay? And one of those 'adjustments',

357
00:20:25,894 --> 00:20:28,421
it would have meant me riding
a desk for the rest of my career

358
00:20:28,422 --> 00:20:29,677
watching third-rate detectives

359
00:20:29,678 --> 00:20:31,336
fumble their way
through homicide cases.

360
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:32,932
Am I supposed to resent that remark?
What's that about?

361
00:20:32,933 --> 00:20:34,979
You know what?
You can take that however you want.

362
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,001
You started it.

363
00:20:37,509 --> 00:20:38,514
All right.

364
00:20:39,498 --> 00:20:41,669
Rather than have this whole
evening go off the rails,

365
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:43,274
I'll make a deal with you, okay?

366
00:20:44,157 --> 00:20:47,049
You tell me why you're poking around
in this and I will share some,

367
00:20:47,434 --> 00:20:49,340
some, of what I know.

368
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,175
Fine.

369
00:20:55,062 --> 00:20:56,423
You show me yours first, though.

370
00:20:57,644 --> 00:20:59,451
Always was that way
with you, wasn't it?

371
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,162
Okay. Fine.

372
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,630
I figure from the way Reddick
was beat up before he was killed

373
00:21:08,633 --> 00:21:10,219
that the killer had to be on something.

374
00:21:10,252 --> 00:21:11,550
Yeah, maybe crystal meth, PCP.

375
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,441
That would give him
that kind of crazy energy.

376
00:21:13,442 --> 00:21:16,009
Exactly. The wounds,
they could have been caused by a,

377
00:21:16,178 --> 00:21:18,028
glove with razors or knives on it.

378
00:21:18,037 --> 00:21:19,474
- Like Freddy Kruger?
- Yeah.

379
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:21,503
- Something like that.
- What about the blood?

380
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,360
Well, it could be
a ritual thing, you know?

381
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,088
Oh, for the occult, maybe.

382
00:21:25,238 --> 00:21:26,309
Yeah. Could be.

383
00:21:26,534 --> 00:21:27,813
Why, you got a better theory?

384
00:21:29,482 --> 00:21:31,794
Okay, um... my client

385
00:21:31,869 --> 00:21:33,399
is Ian Reddick's girlfriend.

386
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:36,489
She believes a vampire killed him

387
00:21:40,361 --> 00:21:41,366
A vampire.

388
00:21:42,596 --> 00:21:44,432
Come on, Vick,
going private is no excuse

389
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:46,774
to take money from somebody
who's not playing with a full deck.

390
00:21:46,775 --> 00:21:47,864
Listen,

391
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:50,212
from what I've seen
this is as good a theory as any,

392
00:21:50,428 --> 00:21:52,550
Okay? There was something
about the killer.

393
00:21:52,551 --> 00:21:55,330
The way he moved.
His strength, you know? I mean,

394
00:21:55,527 --> 00:21:58,560
how about the fact that
he took every drop of blood.

395
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:00,875
- Come on.
- Maybe he had something with him.

396
00:22:00,876 --> 00:22:02,055
- I don't know.
- Like what?

397
00:22:02,056 --> 00:22:03,828
A portable blood-sucking machine?

398
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:06,419
Mike, I went back to the alcove
where the killer disappeared

399
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:07,504
and I found blood

400
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:09,992
four inches into a crack in the wall.

401
00:22:10,012 --> 00:22:12,199
Oh, well, that's a hell of
an escape route.

402
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,709
I mean, Vicki come on.
You're talking about real life murders

403
00:22:14,737 --> 00:22:16,761
being committed by some character
out of a monster movie

404
00:22:16,762 --> 00:22:18,255
It's ridiculous.
What are you doing?

405
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:19,452
Why are you...?

406
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:20,587
You know what?

407
00:22:22,751 --> 00:22:23,814
I'm sorry.

408
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:25,795
You know I was just about to tear
your head off for something

409
00:22:25,796 --> 00:22:27,805
I don't even believe. This is crazy.

410
00:22:28,172 --> 00:22:29,420
Well, maybe I am losing it.

411
00:22:30,078 --> 00:22:31,873
Here, eat your fortune cookie.

412
00:22:32,662 --> 00:22:33,751
Get some Vitamin A.

413
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:37,968
- Nice catch.
- Clearly I need more beer.

414
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,721
Yeah, I just got out of a meeting
with Cindy and Rob.

415
00:22:44,871 --> 00:22:47,106
Network is screaming
about the violence in the show.

416
00:22:47,547 --> 00:22:49,322
Well, I told him this isn't the '50s.

417
00:22:49,323 --> 00:22:51,885
There's more violence
in your kids' nursery schools.

418
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:53,827
Well, they started with
the whole chicken and egg thing,

419
00:22:53,828 --> 00:22:55,388
and that's when I lost it.

420
00:23:11,362 --> 00:23:12,442
Gerry?

421
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:13,907
Uh... no.

422
00:23:14,564 --> 00:23:15,775
No, it was nothing.

423
00:23:16,278 --> 00:23:17,297
Where was I?

424
00:23:17,306 --> 00:23:20,057
Yeah, so I said, you know,
it's just a TV show.

425
00:23:20,622 --> 00:23:22,988
What does one more lousy
murder at an act end matter?

426
00:23:24,687 --> 00:23:25,692
Sorry love,

427
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,730
you just got cancelled.

428
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:34,669
Well, that was fun.

429
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,875
Kinda like old times, huh?

430
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:38,612
The talking or the fighting?

431
00:23:39,382 --> 00:23:41,157
I was thinking both, actually.

432
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:43,461
Bye.

433
00:23:55,469 --> 00:23:57,657
I've got some work to do still.

434
00:23:57,704 --> 00:23:59,638
It's ten o'clock.

435
00:24:01,651 --> 00:24:03,726
I've got to check out
that bar that Ian worked at.

436
00:24:03,745 --> 00:24:05,377
Vicki, I already checked out that bar.

437
00:24:05,378 --> 00:24:07,022
It is a dead end, all right?

438
00:24:07,435 --> 00:24:09,332
Well, maybe it needs
a better investigator.

439
00:24:11,997 --> 00:24:13,462
Just like old times!

440
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,816
The city's finally world class, eh?

441
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:32,523
- What?
- The vampire.

442
00:24:33,030 --> 00:24:34,635
I mean you always imagine them in like,

443
00:24:34,663 --> 00:24:36,307
New Orleans or London.

444
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:37,513
Now we've got our own.

445
00:24:37,607 --> 00:24:39,523
Who knows?
They might have always been here.

446
00:24:39,579 --> 00:24:41,147
Oh, people would have known.

447
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,778
I mean, hideous blood-sucking
freaks running around

448
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:45,158
kind of make an impression.

449
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,529
They might at that.

450
00:24:47,205 --> 00:24:48,756
I knew that guy, Ian,

451
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:49,986
the one who was killed.

452
00:24:50,878 --> 00:24:52,136
He lived across the street.

453
00:24:52,268 --> 00:24:54,249
- Really?
- He worked at the Nervosa Club

454
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,512
Nice guy.

455
00:24:55,718 --> 00:24:58,084
He used to let people in the
service biz in for free.

456
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:00,243
I'll have to check it out sometime.

457
00:25:00,281 --> 00:25:01,558
You need someone to go with,

458
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:03,222
I get off at ten.

459
00:25:04,781 --> 00:25:06,762
I'm glad I kind of made an impression.

460
00:26:15,237 --> 00:26:16,307
You're new here.

461
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:17,680
Not new to that line.

462
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,727
What are you doing here?

463
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:29,362
You wanna take that hand off my arm
before I snap it off at the wrist.

464
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,474
I need to know about Ian Reddick.

465
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,736
What do you think people
have been talking about?

466
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,888
Last night was a perfectly normal night.

467
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:53,669
You don't wind up being killed
on a perfectly normal night.

468
00:26:53,688 --> 00:26:54,937
Trust me on that one.

469
00:26:55,631 --> 00:26:57,151
He had a problem with a couple guys,

470
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:59,124
- had to cut them off.
- What guys?

471
00:27:00,251 --> 00:27:01,660
They're in here every night.

472
00:27:03,708 --> 00:27:04,713
Thanks.

473
00:27:11,736 --> 00:27:12,854
Good evening, gentlemen.

474
00:27:13,023 --> 00:27:14,037
We're busy.

475
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,755
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

476
00:27:21,261 --> 00:27:22,369
Why didn't you say so.

477
00:27:23,317 --> 00:27:24,529
Love meetin' new people.

478
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,256
Step into our office.

479
00:27:48,061 --> 00:27:49,395
Hey, can I talk to you a minute?

480
00:27:52,626 --> 00:27:53,631
Escuse me!

481
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:02,716
So this is better.

482
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:03,951
So what do you want to know?

483
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:05,492
They say the waiter
who was killed the other night

484
00:28:05,493 --> 00:28:06,797
had a problem with you guys.

485
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,731
That's a lot more expensive question.

486
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,206
He said we were bothering the girls,
he got us kicked out.

487
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:17,112
That might make
some people angry at him.

488
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:18,145
Yeah, try pissed.

489
00:28:18,305 --> 00:28:19,376
But you didn't kill him.

490
00:28:20,052 --> 00:28:21,059
You're unpleasant,

491
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:23,929
but you're not involved
in the kind of evil that killed him.

492
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,364
How do you know
what the hell we are?

493
00:28:28,148 --> 00:28:29,155
We're done here.

494
00:28:31,505 --> 00:28:34,352
You know we've done
a lot of talking for you, pretty boy.

495
00:28:35,526 --> 00:28:36,906
I think we deserve a bonus.

496
00:28:36,907 --> 00:28:38,681
I'll give you something
you don't deserve,

497
00:28:38,785 --> 00:28:39,799
and that's a warning.

498
00:28:45,296 --> 00:28:46,376
Ian worked a normal shift,

499
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:48,038
picked up his check
and headed home.

500
00:28:48,732 --> 00:28:50,200
Is that the best you can give me?

501
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,729
There were some guys
here he had a problem with.

502
00:28:55,561 --> 00:28:57,976
Hey, are those freaks who
Ian threw out, around tonight?

503
00:28:58,406 --> 00:28:59,796
They went outside with that guy.

504
00:29:00,237 --> 00:29:01,336
What guy?

505
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:03,855
Pale, black suit.

506
00:29:04,859 --> 00:29:06,230
That sure narrows it down.

507
00:29:06,925 --> 00:29:08,465
Pretty boy. Long brown hair.

508
00:29:10,775 --> 00:29:11,932
Where's outside?

509
00:29:22,482 --> 00:29:23,519
Stop.

510
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,936
You don't want to go out there,
beautiful.

511
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:28,429
Yeah, actually I'm pretty sure I do.

512
00:29:29,124 --> 00:29:30,927
Aw... maybe we should dance instead.

513
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:37,937
You picked the wrong dance-partner.

514
00:29:41,566 --> 00:29:43,375
You will not remember
what happened tonight,

515
00:29:43,384 --> 00:29:46,206
but you will remember there are bigger
predators than you out there.

516
00:29:46,539 --> 00:29:48,013
You will not do this again.

517
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:53,898
Who did this to you?

518
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,799
I don't know.

519
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,843
You all right, Mr. Fitzroy?

520
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,776
Cooking accident.
Making dinner at a friend's.

521
00:30:24,777 --> 00:30:27,413
It looks bad. You want me
to call somebody to take a look at it?

522
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:29,557
I'm sorry. I'm fine. Thank you.

523
00:30:37,537 --> 00:30:38,946
Look, if it was up to me,

524
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:40,842
I wouldn't have said
nothing to nobody.

525
00:30:41,105 --> 00:30:42,110
But my wife,

526
00:30:42,157 --> 00:30:44,411
she said it might be important
to stopping this guy.

527
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,328
Yeah, well, anything helps, right?

528
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:48,057
So you say you saw somebody?

529
00:30:48,058 --> 00:30:50,290
Man, I'm not sure what I saw.
I was working the block

530
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:53,154
next to the park and I seen
something drop out of the sky.

531
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:54,233
What something?

532
00:30:54,234 --> 00:30:56,196
Okay, this is where
it starts to get messed up.

533
00:30:56,224 --> 00:30:58,821
It started out as birds or bats and then

534
00:30:58,822 --> 00:31:01,130
when it gets close to the ground
it kinda came together.

535
00:31:01,144 --> 00:31:03,491
They sort of took a shape
as they dropped over the treetop.

536
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,743
- Yeah? What kind of shape?
- I don't know, like a guy.

537
00:31:05,744 --> 00:31:06,749
Like a guy.

538
00:31:06,941 --> 00:31:09,542
He was all flappy.
Like he was wearing a long coat...

539
00:31:09,692 --> 00:31:11,138
made a noise in the wind.

540
00:31:11,589 --> 00:31:13,666
You see, this is why
I didn't want to say nothing.

541
00:31:13,711 --> 00:31:14,744
So what happened next?

542
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:15,945
It was just after that

543
00:31:16,396 --> 00:31:18,180
I heard the screams,
then the cops show up.

544
00:31:19,241 --> 00:31:20,901
All right, well, thank you.

545
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,269
Thank you for your time.
You've been a great help.

546
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,656
If this thing is a vampire,

547
00:31:28,909 --> 00:31:29,998
you need holy water.

548
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,766
- Holy water?
- Yeah, that's what the wife says.

549
00:31:35,072 --> 00:31:36,996
That's what the wife says,
don't you know that?

550
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:53,940
- I'm Norman.
- Good for you.

551
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,809
Hey, this is, uh... my new ride.

552
00:31:56,354 --> 00:31:58,825
Pretty cool, huh?
You want to go for a cruise?

553
00:31:58,994 --> 00:32:00,337
Why would I want to do that?

554
00:32:01,483 --> 00:32:02,953
Oh, because I did it, right?

555
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:04,931
I got the car.

556
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,954
I got the fancy clothes.

557
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:09,945
Really.

558
00:32:10,504 --> 00:32:12,991
Are you going to let me pass
or do I have to scream for help.

559
00:32:30,925 --> 00:32:32,371
Like screaming's going to help.

560
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:50,519
Where did you go?

561
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:53,956
Wild guess, but I don't think
they go anywhere.

562
00:32:54,031 --> 00:32:55,186
You'd be surprised.

563
00:32:56,794 --> 00:32:58,174
Now, where were we?

564
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,831
Blood, we were talking about blood.

565
00:33:01,395 --> 00:33:03,807
Yes, yes, blood.

566
00:33:03,854 --> 00:33:07,096
Well, it was blood.
And it was Ian Reddick's blood.

567
00:33:07,425 --> 00:33:08,788
How it got there I can't say.

568
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:10,770
There really is
no reasonable explanation.

569
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,328
You're going to think
I'm crazy for mentioning this,

570
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:17,953
but the woman that hired me believes
it was a vampire that killed him.

571
00:33:18,754 --> 00:33:21,002
Well, that would explain
certain other findings.

572
00:33:21,421 --> 00:33:24,401
Well, there was a substance on Ian's
throat and that of the other victims

573
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,875
which was something like saliva.

574
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,266
Like saliva?

575
00:33:27,369 --> 00:33:29,125
I'd be more precise if I could,

576
00:33:29,135 --> 00:33:31,604
but it doesn't match
any animal or human species.

577
00:33:31,614 --> 00:33:32,834
And there's something else.

578
00:33:33,939 --> 00:33:36,292
I found this under the nails
of the woman that was killed

579
00:33:36,293 --> 00:33:38,029
in the parking garage last night.

580
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:42,229
It's very similar in structure
to a bat's wing but...

581
00:33:42,246 --> 00:33:44,874
But it doesn't match
any human or animal species.

582
00:33:45,644 --> 00:33:46,698
Exactly.

583
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:48,050
Intriguing, isn't it?

584
00:33:54,822 --> 00:33:57,122
So... so what are we talking
about then?

585
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,329
We've got Count Dracula

586
00:33:59,545 --> 00:34:01,085
out there on a bender?

587
00:34:01,817 --> 00:34:03,310
We must keep an open mind.

588
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,709
There are more things in heaven
and earth than are dreamt of in the...

589
00:34:06,803 --> 00:34:08,486
police officers' training manual.

590
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,885
I'm starting to believe that.

591
00:34:14,851 --> 00:34:15,930
Now,

592
00:34:16,203 --> 00:34:17,837
Mary Baum.

593
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,353
Where would Mary Baum be hiding?

594
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,485
I seen the way
you looked at her, man.

595
00:34:25,448 --> 00:34:26,527
You were gone.

596
00:34:26,528 --> 00:34:28,143
No, no, you were way past gone.

597
00:34:28,153 --> 00:34:30,452
Now we were talking about the case.
How the hell do you get that?

598
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:31,783
Look man, I got eyes.

599
00:34:31,796 --> 00:34:33,192
Let me think.

600
00:34:33,193 --> 00:34:35,292
Last time you got out with
all your parts intact.

601
00:34:35,577 --> 00:34:37,081
Next time you might not
be so lucky.

602
00:34:37,774 --> 00:34:39,015
Who are you to talk, Dave?

603
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,921
Your third marriage is on its last legs.

604
00:34:42,001 --> 00:34:43,870
My girlfriend's not too happy either.

605
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,810
You know, I think
this kinda qualifies me

606
00:34:46,811 --> 00:34:48,347
as having a certain amount of...

607
00:34:48,661 --> 00:34:50,351
experience, dealing
with difficult women.

608
00:34:51,121 --> 00:34:52,905
Gee, I would think it might not be them.

609
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,827
You see what I'm talking about
dealing with difficult women?

610
00:34:56,828 --> 00:34:59,502
So Vicki has a strong
personality. So does Mike.

611
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:01,970
Maybe they're made for each other.

612
00:35:01,971 --> 00:35:04,489
Yeah, like, um...
gasoline and a match.

613
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:07,082
My bet is? He gets whupped.

614
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:10,401
I'm so thrilled to have been
a part of this conversation.

615
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,410
Honestly.

616
00:35:12,073 --> 00:35:13,222
Don't listen to him, Mike.

617
00:35:13,802 --> 00:35:15,005
She got away once.

618
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:18,140
If there's even a chance
it could work, you have to take it.

619
00:35:18,162 --> 00:35:21,141
Well, I do appreciate that.
Thank you for your concern.

620
00:35:21,803 --> 00:35:23,536
Anybody do any work around here?

621
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:26,093
I'm going to go talk to...

622
00:35:26,198 --> 00:35:27,207
I'll talk to you later.

623
00:35:29,925 --> 00:35:31,731
Man, somebody get that girl a doughnut.

624
00:35:32,283 --> 00:35:34,218
You are here for a reason, right?

625
00:35:34,476 --> 00:35:36,787
Just checked in with the M.E.
Did you read that report?

626
00:35:37,241 --> 00:35:38,789
That report is for me only.

627
00:35:38,983 --> 00:35:40,285
what do you think of it, though?

628
00:35:40,286 --> 00:35:42,444
I mean, the batwing
that's not from a bat.

629
00:35:42,445 --> 00:35:43,781
The saliva

630
00:35:43,782 --> 00:35:46,540
- that's not human or animal.
- It's so obviously a vampire, right?

631
00:35:46,552 --> 00:35:48,523
Look, I'm just trying
to make sense of this.

632
00:35:48,524 --> 00:35:50,297
Vicki, I'm not going
to start hunting vampires.

633
00:35:50,298 --> 00:35:52,043
I don't need you running
around scaring people, OK?

634
00:35:52,044 --> 00:35:54,430
The papers are already having
a field day with this thing.

635
00:35:54,941 --> 00:35:56,877
I am a concerned citizen, all right?

636
00:35:56,888 --> 00:35:58,336
I'm trying to help
with an investigation.

637
00:35:58,337 --> 00:35:59,649
If you don't want my help...

638
00:36:01,375 --> 00:36:02,559
Look, I'm cool with that.

639
00:36:03,882 --> 00:36:04,914
Vickiii...

640
00:36:07,823 --> 00:36:09,477
Great. Great.

641
00:36:40,868 --> 00:36:42,518
Finish the ritual, Nightwalker.

642
00:36:42,542 --> 00:36:43,996
The power will be yours.

643
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:45,744
Saw something on the monitor?

644
00:36:46,589 --> 00:36:48,524
Probably somebody's
dog got loose.

645
00:36:52,019 --> 00:36:53,990
There. You see?

646
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,807
Nothing.

647
00:37:01,262 --> 00:37:02,355
Vicki Nelson.

648
00:37:02,366 --> 00:37:03,719
Ms. Nelson, it's Coreen.

649
00:37:03,827 --> 00:37:04,833
Hi, Coreen

650
00:37:04,887 --> 00:37:07,015
Have you found out anything
about Ian's killer yet?

651
00:37:07,084 --> 00:37:09,215
You know, I told you
this would take a little time.

652
00:37:10,007 --> 00:37:11,359
We might not have time.

653
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,982
How many peopleis this undead creep

654
00:37:13,026 --> 00:37:14,595
gonna kill before somebody stops it?

655
00:37:18,696 --> 00:37:19,702
Coreen...

656
00:37:20,244 --> 00:37:22,517
Okay, say this is something
supernatural.

657
00:37:22,528 --> 00:37:24,563
You're all over
this occult stuff, right?

658
00:37:24,812 --> 00:37:26,284
Like ectoplasm on a poltergeist.

659
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,253
What's the significance of a pentagram?

660
00:37:28,837 --> 00:37:29,912
It's a power symbol.

661
00:37:29,913 --> 00:37:31,521
They're used to focus power in rituals.

662
00:37:31,522 --> 00:37:33,298
Like, to call spirits,
that kind of thing.

663
00:37:33,468 --> 00:37:34,594
Why? What did you find?

664
00:37:34,595 --> 00:37:35,845
It may be nothing.

665
00:37:35,846 --> 00:37:37,834
If I find anything
I'll get back to you, though.

666
00:37:37,835 --> 00:37:39,512
You know something.
Tell me.

667
00:37:39,728 --> 00:37:42,130
Look, if I find anything
I will call you back, okay? Bye.

668
00:37:52,823 --> 00:37:54,599
This is Celluci.
Leave a message.

669
00:37:54,653 --> 00:37:57,315
Hey, Mike, it's Vicki.
This is going to sound crazy, but

670
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:59,744
I plotted the locations
of the three murders

671
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:02,660
and they make up the first three
points of a pentagram.

672
00:38:03,396 --> 00:38:05,365
I think I know where the
fourth is going to be

673
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,017
and I think it's going to be tonight.
Call me back, please.

674
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,944
You thought I wanted you?

675
00:38:18,665 --> 00:38:19,781
Stupid.

676
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:22,172
It's her I'm doing this for.

677
00:39:23,302 --> 00:39:24,871
You seemed disturbed.

678
00:39:25,574 --> 00:39:28,020
- What do you want?
- Tell me what I want.

679
00:39:30,032 --> 00:39:31,386
The girl who ate this?

680
00:39:32,295 --> 00:39:33,312
She's yours.

681
00:39:33,874 --> 00:39:35,476
all right?
I offer her to you.

682
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:36,883
But there's another girl.

683
00:39:37,143 --> 00:39:38,571
Her name is Coreen.

684
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:41,038
She works at the University Pub. I...

685
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:43,830
want her... to love me.

686
00:39:43,927 --> 00:39:44,945
Can you do that?

687
00:39:45,107 --> 00:39:47,196
Stealing trinkets is one thing.

688
00:39:47,683 --> 00:39:49,123
But to steal a heart...

689
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:52,001
that's a tall order.

690
00:39:53,212 --> 00:39:54,716
You have to understand, see?

691
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:57,876
I...don't have the power of love.

692
00:39:58,573 --> 00:40:00,748
For that you need someone

693
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:03,009
much more powerful than I.

694
00:40:04,042 --> 00:40:05,611
Great. Yeah, fine

695
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,266
- How do we call him up?
- First,

696
00:40:07,353 --> 00:40:09,961
let me finish marking
the doorway in blood on the city.

697
00:40:10,177 --> 00:40:12,656
Then, one more sacrifice,

698
00:40:12,883 --> 00:40:14,290
here, in the centre,

699
00:40:14,609 --> 00:40:15,712
and he'll arrive

700
00:40:16,161 --> 00:40:19,266
and he'll be ready
and willing to serve you.

701
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:21,989
I don't care
how much blood has to be spilled.

702
00:40:22,095 --> 00:40:23,437
I want her.

703
00:40:23,702 --> 00:40:25,087
I... I'm tired

704
00:40:25,103 --> 00:40:26,942
of playing the nice guy, okay?

705
00:40:27,834 --> 00:40:28,852
Make it happen.

706
00:40:28,868 --> 00:40:31,151
- You'll find her in Parkdale.
- Yes, master.

707
00:40:54,301 --> 00:40:56,758
That's why I dropped physics
in the first place.

708
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:00,562
...for shopping.

709
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,964
You're right.
See you tomorrow.

710
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:04,258
Bye.

711
00:41:19,261 --> 00:41:21,565
- I'll scream.
- I'd appreciate it if you would.

712
00:41:40,981 --> 00:41:42,279
You're not like them.

713
00:41:43,318 --> 00:41:44,930
My master knows you.

714
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:46,618
He's coming for you!

715
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:02,809
Stop right there!

716
00:42:03,442 --> 00:42:05,368
Make another move and
you're going to lose that

717
00:42:05,369 --> 00:42:06,735
fancy dental work.

718
00:42:18,439 --> 00:42:19,632
<i>Hold it right there!

719
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:34,590
Victoria Nelson, PI.
Cute.

720
00:42:46,891 --> 00:42:48,134
You son of a bitch!

721
00:42:48,258 --> 00:42:49,873
Easy, easy, easy.

722
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:53,155
I was just trying to protect myself.
Perhaps a bit too forcefully.

723
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,679
You think?

724
00:42:55,162 --> 00:42:57,091
I didn't have time
to pick up your glasses.

725
00:42:57,361 --> 00:42:58,924
I see you carry an extra pair.

726
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,513
Thank you.

727
00:43:03,033 --> 00:43:06,178
Now, I know you won't believe me,
but I don't want to hurt you.

728
00:43:06,718 --> 00:43:08,628
Yeah? You've got
a funny way of showing it.

729
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:11,542
I wasn't the one threatening
the other's dental work.

730
00:43:11,909 --> 00:43:13,626
My smile is my best feature.

731
00:43:13,703 --> 00:43:15,903
I've never met
a vain serial killer.

732
00:43:16,269 --> 00:43:17,620
I didn't kill that woman.

733
00:43:17,870 --> 00:43:19,201
I was trying to stop it.

734
00:43:21,246 --> 00:43:23,099
And why would I believe that?

735
00:43:23,562 --> 00:43:25,877
You were there.
You must have seen it.

736
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:32,186
I saw something.
I don't know... what I saw.

737
00:43:34,887 --> 00:43:36,488
The problem with your eyes...

738
00:43:37,105 --> 00:43:38,591
it's more than just bad vision.

739
00:43:38,784 --> 00:43:41,099
Yeah, it's called
Retinitis Pigmentosa.

740
00:43:41,291 --> 00:43:43,780
It's a progressive loss
of visual function.

741
00:43:44,108 --> 00:43:46,905
It starts with night blindness.
Then your vision tunnels

742
00:43:47,368 --> 00:43:49,587
so that it feels like you're
looking through a straw.

743
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,767
Next stop, blindness, and to...

744
00:43:52,057 --> 00:43:53,832
top it off, I'm near-sighted.

745
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,880
People with that condition
might want to stay away

746
00:43:56,881 --> 00:43:58,327
from night-time stakeouts.

747
00:43:58,462 --> 00:44:01,047
Yeah, are we gonna talk about
my vision or are you gonna...

748
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,652
tell me what it was
I'm supposed to have seen.

749
00:44:07,858 --> 00:44:09,034
It was a demon.

750
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:12,198
A demon? Sure.

751
00:44:13,008 --> 00:44:14,012
Why not?

752
00:44:14,013 --> 00:44:15,362
You're taking this rather calmly.

753
00:44:15,363 --> 00:44:17,890
Well, I'd be more concerned
if I actually believed it.

754
00:44:17,948 --> 00:44:19,472
I suppose I wouldn't either.

755
00:44:20,706 --> 00:44:22,481
So, how did you wind up there?

756
00:44:26,358 --> 00:44:28,384
I'm busting your chops
for talking about demons,

757
00:44:28,385 --> 00:44:30,371
and I was out hunting a vampire.

758
00:44:30,748 --> 00:44:32,079
Yeah, I know.

759
00:44:32,831 --> 00:44:34,992
I'm going to let you in
on a little secret, okay?

760
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:36,748
You believe in vampires.

761
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:40,279
I am a vampire.

762
00:44:47,745 --> 00:44:50,369
- You didn't try and kill me.
- Was I supposed to?

763
00:44:50,370 --> 00:44:51,777
Isn't that what vampires do?

764
00:44:51,778 --> 00:44:53,845
Unless of course, you also
thought that garlic and

765
00:44:53,846 --> 00:44:55,540
silver crosses would hurt them.

766
00:44:55,848 --> 00:44:58,819
Call me old-fashioned,
but, I'm pretty religious.

767
00:44:59,476 --> 00:45:02,987
Okay, say you are...
a vampire, Mr...?

768
00:45:03,122 --> 00:45:04,878
Henry Fitzroy.

769
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:06,749
Fitzroy.

770
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:13,283
Why would you be trying to
stop another blood sucker?

771
00:45:13,284 --> 00:45:15,047
That's hardly professional
courtesy, is it?

772
00:45:15,048 --> 00:45:17,289
I couldn't have something
like that running around town

773
00:45:17,290 --> 00:45:18,964
terrifying the
masses, now could I?

774
00:45:19,330 --> 00:45:20,330
The next thing you know,

775
00:45:20,331 --> 00:45:22,697
the villagers are out
with their stakes and their torches.

776
00:45:22,698 --> 00:45:23,699
That happen much?

777
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:25,356
- Often enough.
- Really? - Really.

778
00:45:25,534 --> 00:45:26,770
I've lived a long time...

779
00:45:27,432 --> 00:45:28,677
almost 500 years.

780
00:45:29,823 --> 00:45:32,097
Yeah, I wouldn't have pegged
you for a day over 450.

781
00:45:32,098 --> 00:45:33,343
I use a great moisturizer.

782
00:45:36,180 --> 00:45:38,908
You know, it's a shame you're not
the more trusting type, Vicki.

783
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:58,758
That's a nice trick.

784
00:45:58,926 --> 00:46:00,320
It's not a trick, Victoria.

785
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,434
I'm telling the truth.

786
00:46:05,209 --> 00:46:06,850
That's what I'm afraid of.

787
00:46:14,969 --> 00:46:16,826
The wounds are
exactly the same but...

788
00:46:17,527 --> 00:46:19,265
she hasn't lost the
same amount of blood.

789
00:46:19,266 --> 00:46:21,193
Whoever killed her
didn't have time to take it.

790
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:22,290
Right.

791
00:46:22,337 --> 00:46:24,017
The radio car was
on the scene about a...

792
00:46:24,018 --> 00:46:25,498
minute after they
heard the screams.

793
00:46:25,499 --> 00:46:26,965
Yeah?
They get a look at the guy?

794
00:46:26,988 --> 00:46:29,137
Well, uniform thought
he saw something

795
00:46:29,174 --> 00:46:30,596
before he flipped the light on.

796
00:46:31,448 --> 00:46:33,401
What makes me think
I'm not gonna like this?

797
00:46:34,299 --> 00:46:35,319
Well,

798
00:46:36,018 --> 00:46:38,098
he thought it looked
like a man in black,

799
00:46:38,718 --> 00:46:39,926
carrying a woman.

800
00:46:41,638 --> 00:46:43,029
There's another thing.

801
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:46,443
- They found these.
- God dammit.

802
00:46:51,798 --> 00:46:53,307
<i>This is Vicki, leave a message.

803
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:55,127
Vicki, it's me.
Where the hell are you?

804
00:46:56,131 --> 00:46:57,515
Call me as soon
as you get this.

805
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,292
Why did you bring me here?

806
00:46:59,596 --> 00:47:01,466
If you had a more
compliant personality,

807
00:47:01,467 --> 00:47:03,337
I could have made you
forget what you saw.

808
00:47:03,735 --> 00:47:06,175
- But considering you're so...
- Strong-willed?

809
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:07,899
Try 'hard-headed'.

810
00:47:08,013 --> 00:47:09,618
I had two options, I could...

811
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,231
elimate you...

812
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:12,931
or I could trust you.

813
00:47:14,953 --> 00:47:16,413
Trusting's good.

814
00:47:16,596 --> 00:47:18,246
If I sense I can't trust you,

815
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,741
I can still eliminate you
before you do me any harm.

816
00:47:20,948 --> 00:47:22,432
Just 'cause you got in
a lucky shot,

817
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:23,886
doesn't mean
that I'm easy to kill.

818
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:27,251
Everybody's easy to kill.

819
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:34,401
- Why me?
- You're a private investigator,

820
00:47:34,661 --> 00:47:37,322
and you were good enough
to find him the same time I did.

821
00:47:38,376 --> 00:47:40,315
The demon hunts nights,
as do I.

822
00:47:40,631 --> 00:47:43,409
But if there's a human who's calling
him up, and chances are,

823
00:47:43,619 --> 00:47:45,508
he's living his life by day.

824
00:47:46,779 --> 00:47:48,150
You want to team up?

825
00:47:49,076 --> 00:47:50,607
Until the demon's stopped.

826
00:47:55,343 --> 00:47:56,615
I gotta think about this.

827
00:47:57,529 --> 00:47:59,455
Come to me tomorrow
night with your answer.

828
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:03,619
And Vicki...

829
00:48:05,370 --> 00:48:07,617
I may be the only one
who can stop this demon.

830
00:48:08,531 --> 00:48:10,334
Don't even think of
giving up my secret.

831
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,815
Who'd believe me?

832
00:48:58,123 --> 00:49:00,685
Should I call the cops, or
do you just want to arrest yourself?

833
00:49:00,686 --> 00:49:02,513
Hey, I've been up
all night looking for you.

834
00:49:02,725 --> 00:49:04,095
God, you sound like my mother.

835
00:49:04,597 --> 00:49:05,976
How the hell
did you get in here?

836
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:08,361
I showed the Super my badge.
It works wonders.

837
00:49:08,947 --> 00:49:10,125
You gonna use that, or what?

838
00:49:10,161 --> 00:49:11,779
You know what?
I haven't decided yet.

839
00:49:14,124 --> 00:49:16,520
So, why... why were
you looking for me?

840
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,922
A uniform saw a woman
being taken from the scene of

841
00:49:19,923 --> 00:49:21,383
a homicide last night.

842
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,050
You were there.

843
00:49:25,131 --> 00:49:27,103
You are messing around
with my investigation.

844
00:49:27,185 --> 00:49:28,665
It's my investigation, too.

845
00:49:28,688 --> 00:49:30,593
No, Vicki, you're wandering
around half-blind,

846
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:32,797
looking for somebody who's
already killed four people.

847
00:49:32,798 --> 00:49:34,543
That's a good way of
becoming number five.

848
00:49:40,323 --> 00:49:41,429
Aw, you know what?

849
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,813
I'm, uh...

850
00:49:43,938 --> 00:49:45,974
I'm just happy that
you're alive, all right?

851
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:47,910
Talk to you later.

852
00:50:09,321 --> 00:50:10,585
You said you had this covered.

853
00:50:10,703 --> 00:50:13,262
- We're on it, okay?
- And the Chief is on me,

854
00:50:13,339 --> 00:50:15,749
the Mayor is on him,
and the paper's are on all of us.

855
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:18,367
All right, look. We found
a pattern to the crimes.

856
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,903
It looks like there's some
kind of Satanist agenda here.

857
00:50:20,983 --> 00:50:22,188
Great. Even if we break it,

858
00:50:22,189 --> 00:50:24,233
it's going to make news
for the next ten years.

859
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:27,957
I want this freak taken down,
and fast.

860
00:50:28,132 --> 00:50:29,255
We done?

861
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:31,722
One more thing.

862
00:50:32,725 --> 00:50:34,892
I heard Vicki Nelson's
got her nose in this.

863
00:50:36,726 --> 00:50:38,917
No, she's working
a separate investigation.

864
00:50:39,526 --> 00:50:40,760
That's not what I heard.

865
00:50:41,242 --> 00:50:43,647
We can't afford her
anywhere near this.

866
00:50:43,648 --> 00:50:44,658
She's a wild card.

867
00:50:44,659 --> 00:50:47,164
Vicki cleared just about
every homicide she ever pulled.

868
00:50:47,165 --> 00:50:49,062
We'd be lucky to
have her on this.

869
00:50:49,695 --> 00:50:51,466
You do not want to
stake your career

870
00:50:51,467 --> 00:50:52,961
on that statement, Celluci.

871
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,781
I guess we're working together.

872
00:51:25,805 --> 00:51:26,975
History buff?

873
00:51:27,695 --> 00:51:28,717
Family photo.

874
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,422
- Right.
- You believe I'm a vampire,

875
00:51:31,423 --> 00:51:32,995
but you don't believe
I had a father?

876
00:51:34,103 --> 00:51:37,037
And he just happened to be one
of the most famous figures in history.

877
00:51:40,123 --> 00:51:43,287
But that would make you
Henry, Duke of Richmond.

878
00:51:44,695 --> 00:51:46,142
You surprise me again.

879
00:51:46,450 --> 00:51:47,878
How did you know that?

880
00:51:48,457 --> 00:51:50,482
I have a minor in history.

881
00:51:51,563 --> 00:51:54,264
I learned mine the hard way.
I lived through it.

882
00:51:55,190 --> 00:51:58,180
So how did you end up
drawing comic books?

883
00:51:58,431 --> 00:52:00,283
Graphic novels.

884
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,810
Art and literature have
always been my passions.

885
00:52:03,177 --> 00:52:06,476
I finally found a medium where
I can fully realize the both of them.

886
00:52:07,527 --> 00:52:10,247
This is going to take
some getting used to.

887
00:52:12,871 --> 00:52:14,183
Okay, partner.

888
00:52:14,337 --> 00:52:17,656
Why don't we start by you telling me
how you know so much about demons.

889
00:52:20,549 --> 00:52:22,363
London in the 1890s.

890
00:52:24,195 --> 00:52:26,510
They called themselves
the Hellfire Club.

891
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:29,558
Rich men and women who went
to any length to relieve

892
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,236
the boredom of their
pampered lives.

893
00:52:31,237 --> 00:52:32,723
Mr. Fitzroy,

894
00:52:33,012 --> 00:52:35,211
I've heard so much about you.

895
00:52:35,848 --> 00:52:37,989
The club gave them the sense
they were being wicked.

896
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:39,127
They had no idea.

897
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:40,246
Welcome.

898
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,214
And that's when the evil,
at the center of it,

899
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:43,526
all came out to play.

900
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:51,543
O'Mara was performing a ritual.

901
00:52:52,296 --> 00:52:54,418
I didn't know if
it was real or not.

902
00:52:55,286 --> 00:52:58,141
I knew he was trifling with
something better left alone.

903
00:53:04,354 --> 00:53:07,788
<i>- Why?</i>
- I demand your service!

904
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:11,087
<i>- What do you demand?</i>
- Eternal life!

905
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:13,533
<i>And what do you
offer in return?</i>

906
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:15,694
Blood and a soul.

907
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:18,048
A Nightwalker in our midst!

908
00:53:18,549 --> 00:53:20,999
Take him and
give me his power!

909
00:53:21,134 --> 00:53:22,523
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

910
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:26,517
<i>You shall have your power,
and I shall be free.</i>

911
00:53:37,997 --> 00:53:40,004
<i>Finish the ritual, Nightwalker.</i>

912
00:53:40,543 --> 00:53:42,800
<i>Use his blood to
bring me through.

913
00:53:43,418 --> 00:53:46,890
<i>The power will be yours.
Anything you want!

914
00:53:46,929 --> 00:53:49,707
All I want right now,
is for you to go to hell!

915
00:53:50,343 --> 00:53:52,041
<i>We will meet again, Nightwalker.

916
00:53:54,266 --> 00:53:55,282
I took the grimoire

917
00:53:55,283 --> 00:53:57,713
so that none of O'Mara's
followers would use it again.

918
00:53:58,234 --> 00:54:01,031
It was the smell at one of
the crime scenes that gave it away,

919
00:54:01,147 --> 00:54:03,173
the worst kind of
corruption imaginable.

920
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:06,356
I guess demonology's not for
people with sensitive noses.

921
00:54:06,414 --> 00:54:08,286
Once the demon touches them,

922
00:54:08,556 --> 00:54:11,122
their minds are so broken,
they don't even know the difference.

923
00:54:11,218 --> 00:54:14,016
Whoever's called this demon
still thinks he's in control.

924
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:17,857
Well,

925
00:54:18,357 --> 00:54:20,402
if this guy's
not calling the shots,

926
00:54:20,575 --> 00:54:21,984
what does the demon want?

927
00:54:21,985 --> 00:54:24,047
The thing I saw last
night was a minor demon.

928
00:54:24,163 --> 00:54:25,552
His job is to open a door

929
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,520
to bring a much more powerful
demon through.

930
00:54:27,829 --> 00:54:29,179
Once the pentagram is complete,

931
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:31,899
all it takes is one more sacrifice
to open that door.

932
00:54:32,169 --> 00:54:34,928
- You sure about this?
- His master is Astaroth,

933
00:54:36,007 --> 00:54:38,670
the same demon
I fought 100 years ago.

934
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:40,579
Great.

935
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:45,210
And what, pray tell, happens
at Astaroth's coming-out party?

936
00:54:46,325 --> 00:54:48,197
That's when all
hell breaks loose.

937
00:54:50,199 --> 00:54:51,415
So, for those of us who

938
00:54:51,416 --> 00:54:55,601
skipped Demonology 101,
define 'All hell breaks loose'.

939
00:54:55,698 --> 00:54:57,608
Pure evil unleashed on Earth.

940
00:54:58,302 --> 00:55:01,216
- Like what? Wars?
- Of Biblical proportions.

941
00:55:01,389 --> 00:55:04,553
Death, pestilence and despair
ruling for 1000 years.

942
00:55:04,819 --> 00:55:07,424
Most will become corrupt and
fall sway to the dark forces.

943
00:55:07,425 --> 00:55:10,048
Those who don't,
will die horribly.

944
00:55:10,414 --> 00:55:13,173
You know, don't go painting it all
rosy-coloured for my benefit.

945
00:55:13,323 --> 00:55:14,963
Demons have escaped in the past.

946
00:55:15,214 --> 00:55:17,741
- Why haven't I heard of this?
- You've heard of their work.

947
00:55:17,954 --> 00:55:21,747
The slave trade, the Black Death,
Stalin's atrocities in Russia.

948
00:55:23,343 --> 00:55:25,682
So if we stop the one
who's calling the demons,

949
00:55:25,683 --> 00:55:28,052
- do we stop the demon?
- If we get to it in time.

950
00:55:28,147 --> 00:55:30,756
- The trick is finding him.
- Where do we start?

951
00:55:31,194 --> 00:55:32,595
Well, the demon
from last night

952
00:55:32,596 --> 00:55:34,415
can only offer
material goods.

953
00:55:36,302 --> 00:55:37,344
Well, we can't just go

954
00:55:37,421 --> 00:55:39,910
looking at every newly
rich person in town.

955
00:55:39,911 --> 00:55:41,859
Well, the demon
can't create the goods.

956
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,055
He has to steal them,

957
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:45,640
from somewhere close to where
he's going to deliver them.

958
00:55:46,527 --> 00:55:48,129
Well, I guess we
know what I'm doing.

959
00:55:48,244 --> 00:55:50,579
- How about you?
- Now it's time for me to take a nap.

960
00:55:53,377 --> 00:55:54,554
Victoria...

961
00:55:55,538 --> 00:55:58,336
Vicki. Victoria was
an overweight Queen.

962
00:55:58,374 --> 00:56:00,284
She wore it well, though.
Trust me.

963
00:56:01,287 --> 00:56:03,120
I wanted to thank you
for your help.

964
00:56:03,274 --> 00:56:05,975
I haven't met anyone quite
like you in over a lifetime.

965
00:56:08,985 --> 00:56:11,454
Well, you know,
500 years old or not,

966
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:13,423
you and I start
hanging out together,

967
00:56:13,424 --> 00:56:15,399
people will say
I'm robbing the cradle.

968
00:56:16,717 --> 00:56:19,052
I'm willing to take that
chance if you are.

969
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:26,575
It must be that vampire
magnetism I find so tempting.

970
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:29,932
My powers of persuasion
don't work on you.

971
00:56:30,685 --> 00:56:32,653
Then I guess it's just you.

972
00:56:36,665 --> 00:56:38,478
Past you're bedtime, isn't it?

973
00:56:52,505 --> 00:56:53,952
So you found the vampire?

974
00:56:54,414 --> 00:56:57,019
Know what? I can honestly
tell you it's not a vampire.

975
00:56:57,154 --> 00:56:58,813
You're as bad as the police.

976
00:56:59,083 --> 00:57:02,459
Look, I threw the I-Ching,
consulted my spiritualist.

977
00:57:02,764 --> 00:57:04,346
How much more
proof do you need?

978
00:57:04,385 --> 00:57:06,488
I know a vampire did it.
And so do you.

979
00:57:06,876 --> 00:57:09,230
If you won't help me prove it,
I'll do it myself.

980
00:57:16,907 --> 00:57:19,049
Seen any vampires lately, Coreen?

981
00:57:20,014 --> 00:57:21,557
I don't have time for this.

982
00:57:21,615 --> 00:57:23,988
Maybe it was
a giant mosquito.

983
00:57:24,209 --> 00:57:26,370
Hey, it was her boyfriend, man,
give her a break.

984
00:57:27,296 --> 00:57:29,630
It was a vampire,
and I'm going to prove it.

985
00:57:31,598 --> 00:57:32,910
Coreen...

986
00:57:33,566 --> 00:57:35,341
Get yourself some help.

987
00:57:51,565 --> 00:57:53,552
That's the theft reports
from the last week.

988
00:57:54,324 --> 00:57:56,852
More in the last couple weeks
than the whole month before.

989
00:57:57,275 --> 00:58:00,092
Keep that stuff in order or you're
gonna have some filing to do, too.

990
00:58:00,093 --> 00:58:01,424
It's like I never left.

991
00:58:01,597 --> 00:58:03,275
It's good to see you
around again, Vick.

992
00:58:03,276 --> 00:58:04,414
Yeah, you too.

993
00:58:12,303 --> 00:58:14,136
Still searching
for your vampire?

994
00:58:14,850 --> 00:58:16,181
Not a vampire.

995
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:18,050
It's definitely not a vampire.

996
00:58:18,339 --> 00:58:19,805
Since when?

997
00:58:20,172 --> 00:58:21,715
I was just messing with you.

998
00:58:21,716 --> 00:58:23,375
Come on,
who believes in vampires?

999
00:58:23,432 --> 00:58:26,153
Well, you were all over
me about it yesterday, weren't you?

1000
00:58:27,195 --> 00:58:28,835
Mike, you're out of practice.

1001
00:58:28,912 --> 00:58:31,304
You don't even know when
I'm playing you any more?

1002
00:58:33,137 --> 00:58:34,468
So what's this?

1003
00:58:34,565 --> 00:58:37,054
Uh... I've walked away
from the homicide. I've...

1004
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:39,774
got to trace a stolen Mercedes
for a bail bondsman.

1005
00:58:40,195 --> 00:58:41,201
Really?

1006
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:46,544
Vicki Nelson walking away
from a case, just like that?

1007
00:58:46,776 --> 00:58:49,805
Yup. Other paying clients
waiting for service.

1008
00:58:49,922 --> 00:58:51,060
Well...

1009
00:58:51,735 --> 00:58:52,912
Good luck to you then.

1010
00:58:54,108 --> 00:58:55,150
Thanks.

1011
00:58:56,366 --> 00:58:57,388
Nice tie.

1012
00:59:07,054 --> 00:59:09,408
Look, if you didn't
get the blood you need,

1013
00:59:09,409 --> 00:59:10,700
that's your problem!

1014
00:59:14,482 --> 00:59:16,142
You're supposed
to be so powerful!

1015
00:59:16,817 --> 00:59:18,245
You let him stop you.

1016
00:59:18,765 --> 00:59:20,540
Unforeseen circumstances.

1017
00:59:20,656 --> 00:59:23,279
It won't happen again.
Not when the one after me arrives.

1018
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:25,065
And you are sure
he will serve me?

1019
00:59:26,131 --> 00:59:28,762
Every wish, every whim,

1020
00:59:29,053 --> 00:59:33,327
every dream, every desire.

1021
00:59:34,181 --> 00:59:36,512
You're the master.

1022
00:59:37,169 --> 00:59:38,765
That's right.

1023
00:59:40,107 --> 00:59:42,485
Go, go run off and
do what you gotta do.

1024
00:59:42,486 --> 00:59:44,176
I just want her to be mine!

1025
00:59:46,439 --> 00:59:48,632
I've ID'd a number of thefts
that seem kind a hinky.

1026
00:59:48,633 --> 00:59:50,155
Stuff stolen from
a locked room.

1027
00:59:50,156 --> 00:59:52,441
A Porsche taken from a
showroom full of people.

1028
00:59:52,442 --> 00:59:55,151
Cash taken from a bank vault
that had a time lock.

1029
00:59:55,197 --> 00:59:56,509
Child's play for a demon.

1030
00:59:56,714 --> 00:59:58,619
All of them are around
the University Annex.

1031
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:01,249
Chances are good that
our target is right in the center.

1032
01:00:01,621 --> 01:00:04,300
I mean, our demon caller
may even be a student.

1033
01:00:04,323 --> 01:00:05,912
That's still too big an area.

1034
01:00:06,147 --> 01:00:08,992
Well, unless you have a demon GPS
around here somewhere,

1035
01:00:08,993 --> 01:00:10,210
this is all we have.

1036
01:00:10,938 --> 01:00:12,548
I was hoping not to have to do this.

1037
01:00:12,549 --> 01:00:14,558
What do you mean?
You actually have a demon GPS?

1038
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:15,602
I have always

1039
01:00:15,937 --> 01:00:17,678
avoided contact
with the Dark Arts.

1040
01:00:18,717 --> 01:00:19,926
Although what I'm going to do

1041
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,801
isn't much more than
a parlour trick,

1042
01:00:22,444 --> 01:00:23,858
is still repugnant.

1043
01:00:25,255 --> 01:00:26,309
Do you want to leave?

1044
01:00:26,729 --> 01:00:28,504
I'm always up for a good trick.

1045
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,648
Hey, I can see you.

1046
01:00:35,725 --> 01:00:37,749
Man, another vampire myth
blown to bits!

1047
01:00:37,794 --> 01:00:39,423
That's not what
we needed to show.

1048
01:00:40,032 --> 01:00:41,849
I took this from
the demon in the park.

1049
01:00:42,484 --> 01:00:43,984
This is the one we seek.

1050
01:00:45,998 --> 01:00:48,056
We need to know
where it will strike next.

1051
01:00:53,842 --> 01:00:54,871
I know where that is.

1052
01:00:54,902 --> 01:00:57,495
It looks like a city park.
There could be 20 places like that.

1053
01:00:57,615 --> 01:00:59,361
Demons aren't the
only ones who hunt

1054
01:00:59,362 --> 01:01:00,829
lonely
places at night.

1055
01:01:01,269 --> 01:01:02,501
I know this city.

1056
01:01:03,154 --> 01:01:04,300
It's by Queen's Park.

1057
01:01:05,364 --> 01:01:06,382
All right then, let's go.

1058
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:11,548
Too bad that spell
didn't tell us

1059
01:01:11,549 --> 01:01:12,897
when he was
going to strike.

1060
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:14,156
He won't waste any time.

1061
01:01:14,157 --> 01:01:15,971
He'll take his last
sacrifice tonight.

1062
01:01:18,531 --> 01:01:19,709
You love it, don't you?

1063
01:01:20,427 --> 01:01:21,434
The night.

1064
01:01:21,948 --> 01:01:23,834
All of this.

1065
01:01:24,051 --> 01:01:25,078
It's what I am.

1066
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:27,233
It's what I've been
for a long time.

1067
01:01:29,308 --> 01:01:30,701
Speaking of which,

1068
01:01:31,151 --> 01:01:32,780
how exactly does one...

1069
01:01:33,348 --> 01:01:34,687
become a vampire?

1070
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,968
Vacation in Transylvania.

1071
01:01:37,321 --> 01:01:39,142
Come on, I'm serious.

1072
01:01:41,007 --> 01:01:43,450
It was a woman, Christina.

1073
01:01:44,329 --> 01:01:45,893
We met at my father's court.

1074
01:01:46,737 --> 01:01:48,333
She was only there
during the evenings

1075
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:50,512
and she wouldn't let me
see her during the day.

1076
01:01:52,944 --> 01:01:54,604
Suppose you love
someone so much

1077
01:01:54,605 --> 01:01:56,400
you just shut off
your rational mind.

1078
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,426
Yeah, I'm familiar
with the phenomenon.

1079
01:02:01,289 --> 01:02:03,325
So she... she fed on you?

1080
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,281
That's one reason
to take a mortal lover.

1081
01:02:06,740 --> 01:02:08,896
Didn't you notice
the marks on your neck?

1082
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:11,683
My neck wasn't the only place
she put her mouth.

1083
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:19,371
Then, after about a year,

1084
01:02:19,372 --> 01:02:21,259
she finally confessed
to me what she was.

1085
01:02:22,116 --> 01:02:24,112
People in the court
had become suspicious,

1086
01:02:24,397 --> 01:02:25,750
and she had to move on.

1087
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:28,935
I begged her to turn me.

1088
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,493
Wait. You wanted
to become a vampire?

1089
01:02:32,912 --> 01:02:34,144
I wanted to be like her.

1090
01:02:36,314 --> 01:02:37,384
I wanted to be...

1091
01:02:37,385 --> 01:02:38,858
I wanted to be with her, forever.

1092
01:02:40,451 --> 01:02:41,576
Forever's a long time.

1093
01:02:44,548 --> 01:02:47,667
She warned me that two vampires
couldn't share the same hunting grounds,

1094
01:02:47,668 --> 01:02:49,155
but I didn't believe her.

1095
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:51,444
I told her that
true love would prevail.

1096
01:02:53,082 --> 01:02:55,452
She drank my blood
and I drank hers. I died, and...

1097
01:02:55,975 --> 01:02:57,167
returned from death.

1098
01:02:59,217 --> 01:03:00,766
She showed me
the ways of the night.

1099
01:03:02,137 --> 01:03:04,065
Our lovemaking was like
we were on fire.

1100
01:03:05,592 --> 01:03:07,333
You should work in recruitment.

1101
01:03:08,886 --> 01:03:10,547
Then shortly after a year,

1102
01:03:12,112 --> 01:03:14,060
I was feeding on a woman
I'd met at a tavern.

1103
01:03:14,061 --> 01:03:15,434
Christina was suddenly there,

1104
01:03:16,644 --> 01:03:18,181
angry, vicious.

1105
01:03:18,984 --> 01:03:19,995
Jealous.

1106
01:03:20,547 --> 01:03:22,899
It was the territorial instinct
she had warned me about.

1107
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,673
We almost killed each other,
then she was gone.

1108
01:03:27,062 --> 01:03:28,985
- I'm sorry.
- I should have listened to her.

1109
01:03:29,753 --> 01:03:31,646
I'd have lost her anyway,
but still...

1110
01:03:32,804 --> 01:03:34,066
You never saw her again?

1111
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:37,824
If you live long enough,

1112
01:03:38,489 --> 01:03:39,695
everything comes around again.

1113
01:03:42,759 --> 01:03:44,448
I needed your friend's blood.

1114
01:03:44,464 --> 01:03:47,293
But I've never been able
to refuse a second round.

1115
01:04:01,785 --> 01:04:03,126
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1116
01:04:03,166 --> 01:04:04,586
What the hell are those things?

1117
01:04:04,735 --> 01:04:06,650
You know what?
You really don't want to know.

1118
01:04:06,855 --> 01:04:09,216
But you might want to get out
of here! Now! Come on, go!

1119
01:04:09,541 --> 01:04:11,521
See? We're stronger.

1120
01:04:11,919 --> 01:04:13,350
When the master arrives,

1121
01:04:13,813 --> 01:04:15,141
you'll suffer.

1122
01:04:40,391 --> 01:04:42,500
Henry! Henry?

1123
01:04:43,443 --> 01:04:45,286
Are you okay?
You're okay, right?

1124
01:04:47,095 --> 01:04:49,033
Come on, you just heal, right?
You just heal!

1125
01:04:49,562 --> 01:04:50,925
You can do it.
Come on, you okay?

1126
01:04:53,120 --> 01:04:55,085
I need...
I need to feed.

1127
01:05:25,472 --> 01:05:26,526
<i>Enough!

1128
01:05:31,798 --> 01:05:32,848
I gotta go home!

1129
01:05:33,323 --> 01:05:34,358
I need to go.

1130
01:05:34,798 --> 01:05:35,835
Take me home.

1131
01:05:42,650 --> 01:05:43,650
Mr. Fitzroy?

1132
01:05:51,608 --> 01:05:52,740
Come on...

1133
01:06:15,069 --> 01:06:16,080
Are you okay? What...?

1134
01:06:27,275 --> 01:06:28,912
So we're skatin' nation
on that, right?

1135
01:06:28,954 --> 01:06:30,625
Back some sweet backside air.

1136
01:06:30,675 --> 01:06:34,018
And we're thrashed,
I mean stoked, but thrashed.

1137
01:06:34,170 --> 01:06:36,112
So then we come
walking back through the park.

1138
01:06:36,123 --> 01:06:37,141
All of a sudden, Bam!

1139
01:06:37,142 --> 01:06:38,543
This thing jumps on my buddy, Chad,

1140
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:40,728
and then hits my head
busting a south shore birthday.

1141
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:42,989
- What the hell did you just say?
- Man... English!

1142
01:06:42,990 --> 01:06:45,155
Dude, look, I don't know
who this guy was, all right?

1143
01:06:45,156 --> 01:06:46,541
He was just scary and strong.

1144
01:06:46,813 --> 01:06:49,416
I mean, check it,
seven ply maple hardwood

1145
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:51,312
sliced through it
like it was cheese.

1146
01:06:51,409 --> 01:06:52,950
And then he just let you go?

1147
01:06:52,951 --> 01:06:54,505
Nah, that's when
the other dude came.

1148
01:06:54,506 --> 01:06:57,189
Oh yeah, another guy with like, uh...
big teeth and leather wings.

1149
01:06:57,190 --> 01:06:58,123
This was just a dude.

1150
01:06:58,124 --> 01:07:01,129
He went all B. Lee on this thing, man.
I mean, you should've just seen it,

1151
01:07:01,130 --> 01:07:02,379
like faster than you could see.

1152
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,489
Brother, and the chick!

1153
01:07:04,992 --> 01:07:06,755
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me.

1154
01:07:07,379 --> 01:07:09,951
Glasses, blonde, good looking.

1155
01:07:09,952 --> 01:07:11,011
Oh yeah, hot!

1156
01:07:11,403 --> 01:07:13,563
The first guy laid
a smackdown on her, too.

1157
01:07:13,886 --> 01:07:15,358
Wait a second.
Is she all right?

1158
01:07:15,359 --> 01:07:18,240
I don't know, man.
First chance I saw, I was outta there.

1159
01:07:18,665 --> 01:07:21,474
I'll tell you what. Make sure
that this officer has your information.

1160
01:07:21,475 --> 01:07:23,259
We'll be in touch with
you soon, all right?

1161
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:24,569
My buddy, Chad, is he...?

1162
01:07:24,668 --> 01:07:26,252
We'll be in touch
with you, thank you.

1163
01:07:28,087 --> 01:07:30,920
Best bet at finding this guy and
the poor guy's a space case.

1164
01:07:31,537 --> 01:07:34,818
<i>Another murder last evening
by Metro's vampire killer

1165
01:07:34,819 --> 01:07:36,844
<i>brings the death toll to five.

1166
01:07:37,084 --> 01:07:39,395
<i>Now few details
are available at this time,

1167
01:07:39,396 --> 01:07:42,162

1168
01:07:42,163 --> 01:07:44,597

1172
01:07:50,782 --> 01:07:53,183
I've left messages at your office,
your home and your cell.

1173
01:07:53,184 --> 01:07:54,564
Call me as soon as
you get this!

1174
01:08:36,399 --> 01:08:37,551
<i>Mr. Fitzroy?

1175
01:08:44,850 --> 01:08:45,895
Oh, crap!

1176
01:08:54,653 --> 01:08:55,724
Can I help you?

1177
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:58,309
Oh, I was just... just...
I was just checking in.

1178
01:08:58,310 --> 01:08:59,970
I was worried about Mr. Fitzroy.

1179
01:09:00,050 --> 01:09:01,925
Oh, that's so sweet of you.

1180
01:09:02,889 --> 01:09:04,201
Henry's, um...

1181
01:09:05,192 --> 01:09:06,317
Henry's fine.

1182
01:09:07,669 --> 01:09:09,464
Hey, babe,
it's just the doorman.

1183
01:09:10,830 --> 01:09:13,361
Henry's a little bit...
tied up, right now.

1184
01:09:16,414 --> 01:09:17,485
I'm sorry, I...

1185
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:20,526
absolutely, I didn't want
to disturb anything... anyone.

1186
01:09:21,697 --> 01:09:22,835
- That's okay.
- Sorry.

1187
01:09:22,836 --> 01:09:24,817
But, you have yourself
a good night, all right?

1188
01:09:24,818 --> 01:09:26,402
- Thank you, you too.
- Thanks.

1189
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,259
What am I? An idiot?

1190
01:09:51,731 --> 01:09:53,150
How long have you been awake?

1191
01:09:53,217 --> 01:09:55,307
- Long enough.
- Yeah, well...

1192
01:09:56,204 --> 01:09:58,052
Get dressed. We've got
a lot of work to do.

1193
01:09:58,387 --> 01:09:59,512
You're beautiful.

1194
01:10:00,618 --> 01:10:01,810
Chop, chop, mister.

1195
01:10:07,046 --> 01:10:08,869
So I guess it shouldn't
really be a surprise

1196
01:10:08,870 --> 01:10:10,972
that a professor
of the occult works late.

1197
01:10:11,320 --> 01:10:13,007
She's a bit of a
nighthawk herself.

1198
01:10:13,316 --> 01:10:15,669
I've consulted for her
on various matters over the years.

1199
01:10:16,436 --> 01:10:18,097
Does she know what you are?

1200
01:10:18,285 --> 01:10:19,503
She's been a good friend.

1201
01:10:22,784 --> 01:10:23,816
We've missed you.

1202
01:10:25,182 --> 01:10:26,843
So this is your new friend.

1203
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:29,420
Hi, Vicki Nelson,
Private Investigator.

1204
01:10:29,812 --> 01:10:31,596
We're working
together on something.

1205
01:10:31,698 --> 01:10:32,707
Sorry to keep you late,

1206
01:10:32,708 --> 01:10:34,631
but we need some information
about a student.

1207
01:10:35,316 --> 01:10:37,117
Anything, Henry.
You know that.

1208
01:10:37,509 --> 01:10:39,079
We believe a student
at the university

1209
01:10:39,080 --> 01:10:41,131
might have taken
an interest in demonology.

1210
01:10:42,473 --> 01:10:44,933
A more than academic interest.

1211
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:47,384
Every year, there's a few.

1212
01:10:47,385 --> 01:10:50,143
They play one too many games
of Dungeons and Dragons

1213
01:10:50,762 --> 01:10:54,055
and then they start looking into
places they have no business.

1214
01:10:55,051 --> 01:10:56,824
Can you get us names?

1215
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:58,262
Uh... current students?

1216
01:10:58,263 --> 01:11:00,324
Anyone, perhaps,
from previous years?

1217
01:11:00,681 --> 01:11:02,718
If you give me an hour,
I could fax you

1218
01:11:02,719 --> 01:11:05,029
seven or eight names
you might want to check out.

1219
01:11:05,848 --> 01:11:08,555
All right.
Here's my card, fax number.

1220
01:11:10,941 --> 01:11:14,064
I hope nobody's gotten into trouble
because of this stuff.

1221
01:11:14,573 --> 01:11:16,356
- Vicki Nelson.
<i>- Vick, it's me.</i>

1222
01:11:16,436 --> 01:11:18,031
Hey, Mike, how's it going?

1223
01:11:18,103 --> 01:11:19,738
<i>I've got a body
at the skate park.

1224
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:21,044
Skate park?

1225
01:11:21,902 --> 01:11:23,269
Yeah, no, I have no idea.

1226
01:11:23,470 --> 01:11:26,245
<i>This kid says you were there.
You want to come in for a line-up?

1227
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:29,843
Oh... well, that sounds like a...
like a really good time, but um...

1228
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:31,907
I'm kind of busy tonight.

1229
01:11:31,908 --> 01:11:33,649
Come on, Vicki, talk to me.

1230
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:36,351
Tell me what the hell is going on.
<i>Let me help you.</i>

1231
01:11:37,219 --> 01:11:40,342
Listen, I'm getting a list of names
that I have to run and uh...

1232
01:11:40,891 --> 01:11:42,741
I think one of them
might be our killer.

1233
01:11:43,159 --> 01:11:45,505
All right, don't tell me.
One of them's a vampire.

1234
01:11:45,506 --> 01:11:47,009
<i>Uh... it's actually
worse than that.

1235
01:11:48,750 --> 01:11:50,675
Mike, listen.
I don't expect you to believe me,

1236
01:11:50,676 --> 01:11:53,725
but you asked me to keep you in the loop
on this and that's what I'm doing.

1237
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,187
All right?
I'm not going crazy.

1238
01:11:56,892 --> 01:11:58,459
At least I don't think I am.

1239
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,312
All right.

1240
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:03,594
Fax it over and I'll see
what I can do.

1241
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:06,179
<i>Okay, I appreciate it.
Thank you.

1242
01:12:08,606 --> 01:12:10,601
This cop, Mike,
there's a story there.

1243
01:12:11,096 --> 01:12:13,306
- A long and twisted one.
- You still care about him?

1244
01:12:13,882 --> 01:12:16,721
- Professional curiosity as a writer?
- You could say that.

1245
01:12:17,931 --> 01:12:20,315
I don't know what's
between me and him anymore.

1246
01:12:21,401 --> 01:12:23,503
Speaking professionally,
that's pretty common.

1247
01:12:28,258 --> 01:12:29,356
I've got to go.

1248
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:32,156
If you find our man
before tomorrow night,

1249
01:12:32,228 --> 01:12:34,304
don't try to take him yourself.
Wait for me.

1250
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:37,590
And what should I tell him?
Just to...

1251
01:12:37,925 --> 01:12:39,639
stop killing for a little while?

1252
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:41,702
Bravery...

1253
01:12:43,414 --> 01:12:44,699
is a powerfully

1254
01:12:44,954 --> 01:12:47,659
attractive trait in a woman.
Stupidity is not.

1255
01:12:49,052 --> 01:12:50,444
I'll call you.

1256
01:12:59,858 --> 01:13:02,952
Travis Macdonald, 30 Edith St.
Got it.

1257
01:13:03,132 --> 01:13:04,858
You know what?
As you go through the list,

1258
01:13:04,872 --> 01:13:08,528
be on the lookout for anyone
with a fancy red Porsche, okay?

1259
01:13:10,268 --> 01:13:12,169
"... do anything stupid."
Mike! Come on!

1260
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,522
You know me better than that.

1261
01:13:14,701 --> 01:13:16,321
All right, talk to you. Bye.

1262
01:13:23,916 --> 01:13:25,804
You're Coreen, right?

1263
01:13:26,822 --> 01:13:28,911
Yeah, I'm, uh... Norman.

1264
01:13:29,238 --> 01:13:32,805
From the... pub?
Big tipper? Remember?

1265
01:13:33,962 --> 01:13:34,967
Hey, what's up?

1266
01:13:35,053 --> 01:13:37,314
Well, I heard you talking to
those people the other day

1267
01:13:37,315 --> 01:13:39,128
about how you were looking
for that vampire.

1268
01:13:39,129 --> 01:13:40,129
You know what?

1269
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:42,379
I don't need anybody else
to make fun of me right now.

1270
01:13:42,687 --> 01:13:45,098
I don't want to make fun of you.
No, no, no, I believe you.

1271
01:13:45,205 --> 01:13:47,629
There are supernatural forces
at play here.

1272
01:13:48,276 --> 01:13:49,307
You're serious?

1273
01:13:50,633 --> 01:13:51,718
I can prove it to you.

1274
01:13:52,566 --> 01:13:54,776
Hey, you're the only person
who'll believe me, Coreen.

1275
01:13:54,789 --> 01:13:57,159
You know who killed him?
What proof do you have?

1276
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:01,183
I'll answer all your
questions but, uh...

1277
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:03,499
I can't do it here.

1278
01:14:04,155 --> 01:14:06,847
All the proof is back at my place.
Come on, let's go.

1279
01:14:08,378 --> 01:14:09,824
Hey, that's cool.

1280
01:14:11,150 --> 01:14:12,637
You don't want
to come, that's fine.

1281
01:14:12,638 --> 01:14:14,608
I called the police.
They didn't want to listen.

1282
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:16,771
- I thought you'd understand.
- All right, just...

1283
01:14:16,772 --> 01:14:17,996
Give me a minute, okay?

1284
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:21,626
<i>This is Vicki, beep's coming,
leave a message.

1285
01:14:21,921 --> 01:14:23,300
Vicki, it's Coreen.

1286
01:14:23,662 --> 01:14:24,827
I met this guy named Norman.

1287
01:14:24,828 --> 01:14:27,054
He says he knows about Ian's
murder and the vampire.

1288
01:14:27,443 --> 01:14:30,135
I'm going to his place.
I'll call you if I get anything.

1289
01:14:38,811 --> 01:14:39,842
You all set?

1290
01:14:41,744 --> 01:14:42,842
You know, Coreen,

1291
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:45,186
I've waited for somebody
like you for a long time.

1292
01:14:46,218 --> 01:14:47,731
Somebody who
I could really talk to.

1293
01:14:47,732 --> 01:14:49,772
Somebody who cared
about the same things I do,

1294
01:14:49,773 --> 01:14:51,634
like vintage computers,
Medieval fairs...

1295
01:14:51,635 --> 01:14:54,112
You know what, Norman?
Can we make this quick?

1296
01:14:54,113 --> 01:14:56,228
I mean, I have to meet somebody.

1297
01:14:58,572 --> 01:14:59,657
Don't worry.

1298
01:15:05,804 --> 01:15:08,402
I'm the only friend
you're ever going to need, Coreen.

1299
01:15:14,402 --> 01:15:15,406
Thank you.

1300
01:15:16,505 --> 01:15:18,673
So these are the candidates
for our serial killer?

1301
01:15:19,705 --> 01:15:21,915
Half these kids haven't left
their bedroom this month.

1302
01:15:21,916 --> 01:15:23,884
Somebody on this list
is our guy, Dave.

1303
01:15:24,008 --> 01:15:26,843
Mike, this last guy's mom
still cuts his crusts off.

1304
01:15:26,887 --> 01:15:28,213
And I know Vicki.

1305
01:15:28,548 --> 01:15:31,574
If somebody on that list
isn't our guy, then he's a witness.

1306
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:33,455
So who's next?

1307
01:15:33,785 --> 01:15:35,084
Nobody believed me.

1308
01:15:37,078 --> 01:15:39,342
But that's all
changing now, isn't it?

1309
01:15:40,304 --> 01:15:42,795
And soon, you're going
to see for yourself.

1310
01:15:42,796 --> 01:15:44,001
See what?

1311
01:15:45,408 --> 01:15:46,653
The demon!

1312
01:15:47,108 --> 01:15:48,260
Not just a demon!

1313
01:15:48,688 --> 01:15:51,661
This time, I'm gonna
call a Demon Lord.

1314
01:15:52,563 --> 01:15:54,604
- What are you gonna do?
- Well...

1315
01:15:58,005 --> 01:15:59,116
It's a ritual.

1316
01:15:59,973 --> 01:16:02,504
And you know how it is.
You call up a demon,

1317
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:04,794
something's gonna die, right?

1318
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,633
Not you!

1319
01:16:11,222 --> 01:16:14,663
Not you. Hell you know,
some of those people had to die.

1320
01:16:14,891 --> 01:16:16,377
They had it coming.

1321
01:16:16,966 --> 01:16:19,966
But when I chose your boyfriend,
what was his name?

1322
01:16:21,082 --> 01:16:22,368
- Ian.
- Yeah, whatever.

1323
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:23,979
- You killed Ian?
- Well,

1324
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:25,828
I did it so
we could be together.

1325
01:16:26,886 --> 01:16:28,586
I did. I did it so we
could be together.

1326
01:16:28,587 --> 01:16:30,279
And when I call that Demon Lord

1327
01:16:30,506 --> 01:16:31,738
and he serves me,

1328
01:16:33,654 --> 01:16:34,766
you're gonna be my Queen.

1329
01:16:38,144 --> 01:16:39,483
All right.

1330
01:16:42,256 --> 01:16:43,301
Ready?

1331
01:16:50,111 --> 01:16:51,651
Let's get this show on the road.

1332
01:16:57,342 --> 01:16:58,695
<i>Vicki, it's Coreen.

1333
01:16:58,955 --> 01:17:00,235
<i>I met this guy named Norman.

1334
01:17:00,236 --> 01:17:02,420
<i>He says he knows about Ian's
murder and the vampire.

1335
01:17:02,786 --> 01:17:05,532
<i>I'm going to his place.
I'll call you if I get anything.

1336
01:17:08,116 --> 01:17:09,405
Oh, shoot!

1337
01:17:11,714 --> 01:17:12,769
Henry, it's me.

1338
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:15,146
I've got our guy.
His name is Norman Bridewell,

1339
01:17:15,147 --> 01:17:17,923
52 Lunnigan Ave.
I'm on my way.

1340
01:17:17,924 --> 01:17:19,522
Get there as soon as you wake up.

1341
01:17:21,045 --> 01:17:22,318
52 Lunnigan.

1342
01:17:46,423 --> 01:17:48,264
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1343
01:17:53,286 --> 01:17:55,329
I think we found
our final sacrifice.

1344
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,164
<i>Henry, it's me.

1345
01:18:07,165 --> 01:18:09,548
<i>I've got our guy.
His name is Norman Bridewell,

1346
01:18:09,549 --> 01:18:12,237
<i>52 Lunnigan Ave.
I'm on my way.

1347
01:18:12,419 --> 01:18:13,989
<i>Get there as soon as you wake up.

1348
01:18:25,394 --> 01:18:28,163
See, I need another life,
to bring the Demon Lord.

1349
01:18:28,164 --> 01:18:31,391
I was gonna order a pizza delivery guy,
but you're so much better.

1350
01:18:31,392 --> 01:18:33,084
You know, she's like
part of the family.

1351
01:18:33,085 --> 01:18:35,643
Yeah, well, next time,
leave me off the list for the reunion.

1352
01:18:42,452 --> 01:18:44,047
Took you long enough to get here.

1353
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:45,054
Sorry.

1354
01:18:45,294 --> 01:18:47,953
See? You couldn't even
find a proper sacrifice, so I...

1355
01:18:48,115 --> 01:18:49,351
I had to find my own.

1356
01:18:51,485 --> 01:18:54,196
Lord Astaroth will be pleased.

1357
01:18:54,197 --> 01:18:55,706
Don't listen to him!
He's using you!

1358
01:18:55,852 --> 01:18:57,087
Trying to mess with your head.

1359
01:18:57,088 --> 01:18:59,209
What are you talking about?
You don't even know him.

1360
01:18:59,210 --> 01:19:02,046
For all you know, he's a nice guy.
Look at him, right?

1361
01:19:03,442 --> 01:19:04,738
All right, so tell me.

1362
01:19:05,175 --> 01:19:06,822
What do I got to say
to get him here?

1363
01:19:17,694 --> 01:19:19,076
He's here...

1364
01:19:30,763 --> 01:19:31,770
<i>Finally.

1365
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,842
Finally is right.

1366
01:19:32,843 --> 01:19:34,256
I've been waiting a long time.

1367
01:19:34,280 --> 01:19:35,877
<i>You were the one
who called me?

1368
01:19:36,740 --> 01:19:38,505
<i>Quickly perform the sacrifice

1369
01:19:38,506 --> 01:19:40,243
<i>so I can fully enter this plane,

1370
01:19:40,286 --> 01:19:42,043
<i>and then you will have
what you wish.

1371
01:19:42,141 --> 01:19:43,838
That's what
I'm talking about, man!

1372
01:19:45,510 --> 01:19:46,590
Norman! He's lying!

1373
01:19:47,011 --> 01:19:48,493
He's not going to give
you anything!

1374
01:19:48,494 --> 01:19:50,663
He's going to kill you!
He's going to kill all of us!

1375
01:19:50,664 --> 01:19:51,733
Shut up!

1376
01:19:51,734 --> 01:19:53,671
Does this happen
much in sacrifices?

1377
01:19:53,672 --> 01:19:56,247
'Cause I think she could be
a little bit more cooperative.

1378
01:20:18,457 --> 01:20:19,847
<i>Kill her!

1379
01:20:32,154 --> 01:20:33,309
Ah, crap!

1380
01:20:39,136 --> 01:20:40,692
<i>Eternity is long.

1381
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:43,790
<i>I will be back for you.

1382
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:54,319
My hands.

1383
01:21:01,099 --> 01:21:02,221
It won't come off.

1384
01:21:03,142 --> 01:21:05,836
We can't worry about that now.
You're okay. Let's get out of here.

1385
01:21:05,837 --> 01:21:07,595
Vicki, what the hell
did I just see?

1386
01:21:07,819 --> 01:21:09,978
It's a really long story.

1387
01:21:10,128 --> 01:21:12,372
But I'm sure glad
I'm not the one writing the report.

1388
01:21:36,246 --> 01:21:38,171
Vicki, I can't thank you enough.

1389
01:21:38,305 --> 01:21:39,912
Not just for finding Ian's killer,

1390
01:21:40,180 --> 01:21:42,273
but for proving to me
there really are vampires.

1391
01:21:44,639 --> 01:21:46,899
Who said there
really are vampires?

1392
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:49,845
Henry. I saw him, remember?

1393
01:21:50,354 --> 01:21:52,882
The eyes, the teeth, all the rest.

1394
01:21:53,662 --> 01:21:57,947
Well, I think it would be better
for all concerned if you...

1395
01:21:58,466 --> 01:22:00,592
never mentioned that ever again.

1396
01:22:00,910 --> 01:22:03,773
I agree.
Nobody would believe me.

1397
01:22:04,174 --> 01:22:07,572
But now that I know,
I will be a great assistant for you.

1398
01:22:08,024 --> 01:22:09,230
What?

1399
01:22:12,378 --> 01:22:15,241
Look, I haven't been
to class in two months,

1400
01:22:15,242 --> 01:22:16,797
so school's not an issue.

1401
01:22:17,300 --> 01:22:18,572
I can help you.

1402
01:22:20,414 --> 01:22:23,109
Plus, it'll help keep me
quiet about what I've seen.

1403
01:22:30,130 --> 01:22:31,135
Five hundred a week.

1404
01:22:31,136 --> 01:22:33,428
No benefits unless
you count bad coffee.

1405
01:22:33,662 --> 01:22:34,672
Thank you!

1406
01:22:38,170 --> 01:22:40,631
- Thank you.
- Don't ever do that again.

1407
01:23:06,789 --> 01:23:08,637
I wanted to thank you
for your help, Vicki.

1408
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:10,740
You're a great detective.

1409
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:14,623
Thanks, though it was weird

1410
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:17,408
working with you.
But, I enjoyed it.

1411
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,020
Good.
This won't be the end for us.

1412
01:23:20,410 --> 01:23:22,486
- No?
- You gave me your blood.

1413
01:23:24,327 --> 01:23:25,750
You're part of me now.

1414
01:23:27,709 --> 01:23:31,158
You know, feel free to...
call me if you need to...

1415
01:23:31,179 --> 01:23:34,025
hunt down any demons,
or anything.

1416
01:23:35,097 --> 01:23:36,805
Vicki, speaking of demons...

1417
01:23:39,283 --> 01:23:40,705
These, right?

1418
01:23:43,469 --> 01:23:46,365
I don't know what they mean,
if they mean anything at all.

1419
01:23:46,851 --> 01:23:48,190
But you're worried.

1420
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:52,091
That I may have just agreed
to go steady with a demon.

1421
01:23:52,883 --> 01:23:55,997
All I know is Astaroth
is an enemy of both of us now.

1422
01:23:56,316 --> 01:23:58,509
Then I ask
we'd better stay in touch.

1423
01:24:03,444 --> 01:24:04,582
You'd better...

1424
01:24:06,156 --> 01:24:07,813
Talking to yourself again?

1425
01:24:08,081 --> 01:24:09,437
- You know me.
- Yeah.

1426
01:24:09,438 --> 01:24:11,379
I was just enjoying the night air.

1427
01:24:11,815 --> 01:24:14,309
Oh, you're shivery.
It's not that cold.

1428
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,306
Maybe it's not the cold.

1429
01:24:18,713 --> 01:24:20,354
Well, come on.

1430
01:24:24,104 --> 01:24:26,833
- What's with the arm?
- Sorry, it's just me.
