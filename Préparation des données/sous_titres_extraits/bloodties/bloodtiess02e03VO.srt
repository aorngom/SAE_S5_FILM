1
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,600
I hope recovering this knick-knack of yours
is worth all this waiting.

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,000
-A first century Roman glass bowl is hardly a...
Knick-knack.

3
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:23,700
If it's so priceless why would you ??? with 
this Benoit without see any money

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,100
I've done what I ever done times before

5
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,600
using ??? with that money

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,600
And he was always paid,

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:32,400
he's always paid on time.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,300
Well, if the ??? you 
riconsider your businness practices.

9
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,300
What is he look like?

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,200
Oh, he's businness *****he's late forties.

11
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:41,300
Kinda ???

12
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,500
You haven't even met him?

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,400
Let's just get this bowl
and get out of here, shall we?

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,900
Wow, somebody's cranky.

15
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,900
I came as soon
as you called me.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,500
If I'd known this was a simple
recovery case, I would have...

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,900
stopped for a bite first.
-Oh.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,900
-Henry, what is it?
-There's something here.

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,600
It's pain and fear and hate.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,700
Suffering.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,400
We're in a no-tell motel.

22
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,000
Worst thing going on is some guy getting busy with
Mary from accounts payable.

23
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,200
There's presences.

24
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,800
Scores of them.

25
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,000
Henry?

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,300
Frigobar.

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:44,900
You certainly have the most unconventional methods
I've ever seen.

28
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,800
Your friend is like a bloodhound.

29
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,200
You got the blood part right.

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:52,300
OH!

31
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,700
Okay,
your half hour's up.

32
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:07,300
Are you okay?

33
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,000
No.
I had, um...

34
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,500
a dream or something.

35
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,300
Looks more like a nightmare.

36
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,200
Yeah, I was....I was with Henry.
I, uh...

37
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,900
We were in a building,
but it was a hotel.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,500
We were walking and
something came towards us.

39
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,600
It was like an energy
or something.

40
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,500
And...?

41
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,500
And I died.

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,500
-Cool dream.
-No.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,900
No, it wasn't cool.

44
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,300
And whatever it was,
it tore right through me.

45
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,200
I felt every part of it.

46
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,300
Okay...definitely no more
frozen burritos for lunch.

47
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,300
I need the Ackerman file.

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,400
Right.

49
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,100
Oh!

50
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,700
-The goblet!
-Oh, it was an accident.

51
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,600
-I'm sorry.
-I knew you hated it.

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,200
-No, I like it fine.
-Ahem, Vickie Nelson?

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,800
-We've met.
-I don't think so.

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:08,000
My name is Jacob Keller.
I'm in need of your help.

58
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,500
I'm an antiquities dealer,

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,600
and I'm looking for a business associate of mine,
Benoit Fournier.

60
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,500
Benoit Fournier...

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
You know him?

62
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,300
I don't think so.

63
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Well, he's hired me to
track down a piece for him.

64
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,300
It's a Roman glass bowl.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,300
Now I shipped it to him over a month ago
and I haven't received any payment yet.

66
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,500
His phone number's not listed
and I can't seem to find him.

67
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,900
I'm beginning to fear that
I'm a victim of fraud here.

68
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,500
Well, where did you send it?

69
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,800
Well, I use a bonded courier,

70
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,300
and all they'll give me is the billing address,

71
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,200
which happens to be a mailbox at the photocopy shop.

72
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,600
Do you often do business with
people you know nothing about?

73
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,300
Yes.

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,400
Well, he's a very wealthy man

75
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,000
and, well, you could say,
an offbeat individual.

76
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,600
He doesn't like people
knowing where he lives.

77
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,500
He really sounds
on the up and up.

78
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,900
My business caters
to a lot of eccentric people.

79
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,900
I've learned not to ask
any questions.

80
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,800
When you're poor,
you're crazy.

81
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,200
When you're rich,
you're eccentric, right?

82
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:25,500
I can't tell you the resources
I've used to find this bowl.

83
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,200
But, if I don't find him,
and get paid,my business won't survive.

84
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll look into it.

85
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,300
Okay, well...
here's my card.

86
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,100
Please call me anytime,day or night,
as soon as you find anything.

87
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,600
All right.

88
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,000
All righty, then.

89
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,300
Oh, hey there.
This is Emmy Lou from Union Courier.

90
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,300
To whom am I speaking with?

91
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,200
Oh hi, Gary.
Listen, I'm in a bit of a pickle

92
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,600
and I'm wondering
if you could do me a bitty bit of a favour?

93
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,900
Aren't you precious.

94
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,800
Oh, I bet you're just as cute
as a specked pup in a red wagon.

95
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,000
It's a shame you
live so far away.

96
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:43,500
Well, listen Gary,
we have a package here addressed to box number 413 at your address.

97
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,400
And we have a strict policy of
not delivering to mailboxes.

98
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:50,900
So, I was fixing to see
if you'd be able to give me the registrant's address

99
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,800
so we can deliver this package properly.

100
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,700
Oh, now come on, Gary.
This ain't my first rodeo.

101
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,900
I know you all
got that address.

102
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:03,700
A numbered company, huh?
22 Corrigan.

103
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,200
Oh, Gary, you are just sweeter
than a Tennessee...

104
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,300
Williams.

105
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,500
Don't!

106
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,300
Do one thing for me.

107
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,500
Tell me you've always depended
on the kindness of strangers.

108
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:24,000
Well, if that don't put
the pepper in the gumbo,

109
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,300
I don't know what would.

110
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,000
I have to get in there!
My piece!

111
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:48,800
Stop!

112
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,100
Just keep him here.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,800
Hey, John

114
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,400
M.E. says he couldn't
have been dead more than a hour.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
And the guy next door?

116
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,600
Says he only ever talked to him once,
but he thought he was a bit of a nut job.

117
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,700
I noticed a bloody
shoeprint by the bookcase.

118
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,100
Yes, I already have
F.I.S. on it.

119
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,500
They'll have a brand
in an hour or two.

120
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,300
Nice work, Kate.

121
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
Is that Benoit Fournier?

122
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:22,200
-Oh, this can't be good.
-Thanks for the warm welcome.

123
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,200
Any other time but
a homicide, right?

124
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,600
So...
what?

125
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:30,100
You're going to tell me
that he was killed by the bog monster or a basilisk?

126
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,800
No, actually I'm just here
to retrieve a piece of Roman glass.

127
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,700
I can't believe this.
The first normal case I get and the guy I need to talk to turns up dead.

128
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,800
What happened?

129
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,700
Well, we got a single
stab wound to the abdomen.

130
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
The place was obviously torn apart.

131
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,300
Looks like a struggle.

132
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,300
Yeah, he's got defensive wounds on his hands.

133
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,600
Is that your lucky tie?

134
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,800
No, it's just a tie.

135
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,500
It's just your lucky tie.

136
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,900
Who were you hoping
to get lucky with?

137
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,100
Look, it's not
just lucky like that.

138
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,400
Look, this is the same tie that
you gave me after we solved the Aries murders, right?

139
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,600
For me, it's just work related.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:09,900
Okay, yes.

141
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,400
When we got the call Kate
and I were out celebrating the Nicholls cold case.

142
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,400
Yeah, I heard about that.
Congratulations.

143
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,100
Who would have thought
it was the old man, huh?

144
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,100
Oh, clearly not me.

145
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,600
We worked that case for, what?
Six months solid?

146
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,300
Kate opens it up last week.

147
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,700
She said she had a hunch about the scratches
on the old man's wheel well.

148
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,300
That's quite a hunch.

149
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,800
I'm sure we would have solved it
if we'd had enough time, okay?

150
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,200
Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,700
So, who's this
client of yours?

152
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,500
A guy named Jacob Keller.

153
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
He's been with me for
the last hour and a half,

154
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,600
so don't get your hopes up.

155
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,400
Okay, just covering the bases.

156
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,500
Every one.

157
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,700
So you went out celebrating
wearing your lucky tie...

158
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,700
with her.

159
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,000
Yeah.
Entirely professional.

160
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,300
It's just a tie, Vicki.

161
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
-He'd dead.
-What do you mean he's dead?

162
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,800
Looks like he was robbed.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,300
We have to get it back.
They must have some idea who killed him.

164
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,000
Excuse me! A man is dead!

165
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,200
But I still owe money to the
people who sold me that piece!

166
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,500
I have to get it back.
Are you going to help me or not?

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,100
I may know where your
package is going to be tonight.

168
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,500
Okay, I think it's time you
told me what's going on here.

169
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,100
How do you know the bowl
wasn't in Benoit's office?

170
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,000
The police believe the killer
robbed him and got away.

171
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:52,000
I know.

172
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:55,500
Benoit had an appointment to buy the bowl jotted down
on a note pad in his office.

173
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,600
That could have been
last week, last night.

174
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,700
It could have been
a business lunch.

175
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,000
Did you ever have the feeling,
like you've been somewhere before?

176
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,700
Like ??, paramnesia?

177
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Kinda, only this is like
more than that.

178
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,100
This isn't exactly
a place I'd visit twice,

179
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,500
even in a deja vù.

180
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
A guy and a girl
go out for a drink.

181
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,500
Is that a date?
-What is that about?

182
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,200
I was just wondering.
I mean, is a drink an implied sexual advance?

183
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,000
Other than our strange,sexless relationship we seem to share,

184
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't have much experience in the world
of 'dating'.

185
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,900
Really?
So you don't get your groove on before you put the bite on?

186
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,000
My relationships are usually intense and passionate
from the first glance.

187
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,000
I don't need to make
a sexual advance.

188
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
I am one.

189
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,800
-I hate it when you do that.
-I know.

190
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,900
What is all this
line of questioning?

191
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,400
Oh, I was just wondering
why a guy would wear his lucky tie to work.

192
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:53,400
I mean, especially when he was going out
with a strange woman later on.

193
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:56,200
This hypothetical guy
we're talking about,

194
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:01,600
what would be so wrong if he was wearing his special tie
he believed would help him get lucky?

195
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,900
Well, because maybe the person who gave it to him would be hurt
if she saw him wearing it with some bimbo.

196
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,800
Okay, now I'm starting to sense that this guy
and this bimbo might actually be people we know.

197
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,300
The tie donor, too,for that matter.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:22,100
Look, if it's any consolation,
I believe it takes much more than silk accessory to win a woman over.

199
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,300
Oh, come on, don't you have
some kind of lucky shirt

200
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:29,100
or, I don't know,
socks or something?

201
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,200
Well, I do have a bonnet Anne Boleyn gave to me right
before she tried to poison me.

202
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,600
And I am still here,
so I guess that's lucky.

203
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,900
Forget I asked.

204
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,900
-Uh...excuse me.
-Keller?

205
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,500
Any idea of where
my package is?

206
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,200
Yeah, I do, um...

207
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,800
but I think we have to hurry.

208
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,600
I hope recovering this knick-knack of yours
is worth all this waiting.

209
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,500
-A first century Roman glass bowl is hardly a...
-Knick-knack.

210
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,100
-You're hungry, aren't you?
-I could eat.

211
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,200
-You haven't eaten all day.
-How did you know that?

212
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,500
-She did it again.
-What do you mean, again?

213
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,300
I told you.
I've been here before.

214
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,000
Well, that should make
the rest of this case exceedingly simple.

215
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:14,900
Where do we go from here?

216
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,700
I don't know.

217
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,800
We'd just started looking for the thing
and then something happened.

218
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,900
-Something like...?
-Like we kinda died.

219
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,700
Excuse me, what are
you two talking about?

220
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,300
-You feel it, don't you?
-The energy?

221
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,800
How did you know that?

222
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,700
It's hate and fear
and pain and suffering.

223
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:57,900
Him!

224
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
I think that's the guy.

225
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,200
OH!
Ugh...

226
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,200
Is that it?

227
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,300
That's it!

228
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,700
-Keller! No!
-No! Keller!

229
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,600
HENRY!

230
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,500
Arrggghhh...!

231
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,400
Okay,
your half hour's up.

232
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,900
Are you okay?

233
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,900
-Where's Keller?
-Who's Keller?

234
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,500
A twitchy guy
wearing glasses.

235
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,000
Came in looking
for a Benoit Fournier.

236
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,400
I know.
Can you believe it?

237
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,800
-Thirty years.
-Is this yesterday's?

238
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,000
No, today's.

239
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,700
OH!
The goblet!

240
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,500
-I knew you never...
-I liked it fine.

241
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,300
Forget about the goblet.
Coreen, it's the same day!

242
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,600
-Keller!
-Do I know you?

243
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
-You lied to me!
-I haven't even said anything yet.

244
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:23,900
What is it?

245
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,900
What's in the box?

246
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,400
-How could you know about the box?
-Never mind, you just tell me the truth this time.

247
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,200
This time?

248
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,100
I know what it can do.
The box you want me to look for, what is it?

249
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,200
It's a piece...it's something that I recovered.

250
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,100
I'm an antiques dealer.

251
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,100
Yeah, you're Jacob Keller.
You're an antiquities dealer,

252
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,400
and you're looking
for Benoit Fournier.

253
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,800
You're about to tell me that
it's a Roman glass bowl,

254
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,600
and you sold it to him.
But what you're really looking for is some kind of box.

255
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,100
And I think you're looking for it the same way
that he is.

256
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,000
How could you possibly know that?

257
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,200
Just tell me what's in the box!

258
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
I don't know what's inside the box.

259
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,600
Wrong answer!

260
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,300
It has mystical powers
that's associated with it.

261
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,100
Some say it can prolong life,
give you supernatural powers.

262
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,700
I think it does a whole
hell of a lot more than that.

263
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,400
Let's go save your
friend Benoit.

264
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,400
-You know where he is?
-Yeah, I do,

265
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,800
and in about 15 minutes
he's going to be dead.

266
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,200
What's the rush?
We gotta go see a man about a box.

267
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,100
Okay.

268
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,700
I don't understand.
Who would want to kill Benoit?

269
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Well, if you weren't with us,
you'd be my first suspect.

270
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,800
So you're saying
he actually has the box?

271
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,400
No, I think he's going
to buy it tonight at the Empire Hotel.

272
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,800
Wait a second.
How do you know that?

273
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,300
-Call it a hunch.
-A hunch is when you think it's going to rain tomorrow.

274
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,300
This is play by play.

275
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,300
Just trust me, okay?

276
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,400
Henry!

277
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,300
Janitor!

278
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,800
-Vick?
-I don't care what you say,

279
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,200
a lucky tie means a date.

280
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,800
Where the hell did that come from?

281
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,000
I know...two cops out for a beer after work.

282
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,900
Isn't that how we started?

283
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, yeah, that and a 10-37.

284
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,000
Yeah, we'll always
have aggravated assault.

285
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,900
Okay, look,
did I miss something here?

286
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,300
I feel like I've walked into the middle of a fight
that we haven't even had yet.

287
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,800
What the hell are you doing here anyway?

288
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:36,900
Do you want to hear a theory?

289
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,700
The assailant came in dressed as a janitor looking for something,
which we now know he didn't find.

290
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,600
In the course of looking he got into an altercation
with Benoit Fournier and stabbed him.

291
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,500
-Questions?
-One.

292
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
Who's Benoit Fournier?

293
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,300
Oh.

294
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,500
Okay, I mean, is that a date?

295
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,200
A guy and a girl can go out
for a drink without it being a date?

296
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,800
Even if he is wearing his lucky tie?

297
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,600
I wouldn't know.

298
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:22,800
-Aside from our strange...
-I know, we have a strange relationship and you've never been much for dating.

299
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,100
Why do I feel like I don't
have to be in this conversation?

300
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
It makes sense, doesn't it?
Them?

301
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,800
-Absolutely.
-What?

302
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,000
Well, it's not like
you've snapped him up.

303
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,400
And with him seeing someone,
you might want to take this opportunity to move on as well.

304
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,000
To someone special.
Someone who deserves you.

305
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,400
Right.
Someone who'll be snacking on a different girl in his bed every night of the week.

306
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,600
Everybody has their flaws.
Speaking of which...

307
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,400
I know, I called
before you had time to.

308
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,200
What about her?
She looks like your type.

309
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,800
Keller?
What are you doing here?

310
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,200
Well, you said they were
going to make the exchange.

311
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:58,300
-I can help.
-Of course you can.

312
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,000
He came from this direction.

313
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,100
All right, we're going
to end this right here.

314
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:18,800
He's going to be coming through
that door right about...

315
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,500
now.

316
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,600
Ooomph!

317
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,400
Okay, you are going to tell
us what the hell is going on.

318
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,100
Stop it!

319
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,100
??
NO!

320
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,500
Okay, your half hour's up.

321
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,300
Okay, Keller's going to
be coming in here looking for me again,

322
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,900
and I want you to
hold him here until I get back.

323
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,400
What do you mean again?
Who's Keller?

324
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,900
Hey, it's me.
I'll be downstairs so stay in the car.

325
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,800
Wait!
I need the Ackerman file.

326
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,600
It's on my desk.

327
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,200
-Where are you going?
-Later.

328
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,600
OH! The goblet!

329
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,500
Okay, so you had a client come in today
looking for a business associate of his, Benoit.

330
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,300
But what he's really looking for is
a box Benoit is on his way to buy.

331
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,200
Yeah, it's a box.

332
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,600
It's an ancient box,
and the's something inside,

333
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,100
some kind of mystical energy.

334
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,500
And it is evil,
more evil than you could imagine.

335
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,900
You died.
I died.

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
-Everyone died.
-If I might say so,

337
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,900
you're looking awfully appealing
for someone who's dead.

338
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,500
Henry, listen,
my marks glowed.

339
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,600
Something kept me alive.

340
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,900
You think because Astaroth has marked you
that other evil can't touch you?

341
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,600
Maybe, I don't know.

342
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Maybe he's saving me for something,

343
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,200
and if that's the case,
I'm going to use it.

344
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,800
Don't!
Do not begin to think that you're on the right side of evil,

345
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,000
that you can beat it.
That's part of its seduction.

346
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,500
I watched us die
three times tonight.

347
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,800
And if I have a chance to stop it,
I'm going to take it.

348
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,300
-Vicki, please.
-Henry, I may have been marked by that thing,

349
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,600
but I am not going to be fate's bitch.

350
00:20:08,668 --> 00:20:10,833
Benoit Fournier?

351
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,982
Who are you?
And what are you
doing in my office?

352
00:20:12,908 --> 00:20:14,803
My name is Vicki Nelson.
I'm a private investigator.

353
00:20:14,804 --> 00:20:16,333
I was hired by Jacob Keller.

354
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:18,274
I'm sure I don't know
anybody by that name.

355
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,368
Please, Mr. Fournier,
I need you to come with me.
You're in danger.

356
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,995
Madam, with
all due respect...

357
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:24,484
It's about the box.

358
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:26,888
I don't know anything about any boxes.

359
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,200
Henry?

360
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:36,834
You're coming with us.

361
00:20:41,667 --> 00:20:42,607
Come on.

362
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:45,866
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into with that box.

363
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:48,134
Nonsense.
How could something so beautiful be dangerous?

364
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:50,800
Trust me.
I've seen it, up close and personal.

365
00:20:50,801 --> 00:20:53,967
Twenty-five years. It's taken me 25 years
to locate that box and

366
00:20:53,981 --> 00:20:56,067
I'll be damned if I'm going to let you stop me now.

367
00:20:57,401 --> 00:20:58,917
Like, I got here too soon.

368
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:02,432
- But Vicki said...
- I don't care what she said,

369
00:21:03,001 --> 00:21:05,067
- I have to be on my way.
- But Mr. Keller, please!

370
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:08,017
I can't let you go yet.
She'll be here any minute and she really wants
to talk to you.

371
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,167
Why would she want to talk
to me? I don't even know her!

372
00:21:10,201 --> 00:21:12,000
I have no idea.
She was a little weird this morning.

373
00:21:12,001 --> 00:21:14,067
She gets like that sometimes.
But you have to trust her,

374
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:16,501
because it's when she's
the craziest that she's most right.

375
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:19,103
I don't care. If you don't let me out
that door right this second, I'm going to have to...

376
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:20,534
What what?

377
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:23,101
- You!
- Hello, Keller.

378
00:21:23,234 --> 00:21:26,205
Your goons may have brought me here,
but that won't get you the box.

379
00:21:26,206 --> 00:21:27,667
Be careful who you call a goon.

380
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,940
How dare you put a price on it, like it's one
of your little trinkets.

381
00:21:30,941 --> 00:21:33,234
That is a priceless
artifact, my friend.

382
00:21:33,368 --> 00:21:36,368
I'm sorry if myove of beauty offends your
holarly sensibilities.

383
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,501
Enough!

384
00:21:37,734 --> 00:21:40,967
Hey, whatever either of you
think you know about this box,

385
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,967
it doesn't matter.
It is about to fall into the wrong hands
and we have to stop it.

386
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,467
- Keep them here.
-  Wait...!

387
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:50,234
No one leaves.

388
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:53,134
Sit down!

389
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:55,733
But you don't understand!
I have to get out of here.

390
00:21:55,734 --> 00:21:57,334
SIT DOWN NOW!

391
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,500
Okay.

392
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:09,233
I will never get tired
of the way that you do that.

393
00:22:10,567 --> 00:22:11,867
It's awesome.

394
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:20,400
Hey, Mike, it's me.
I'm sorry to interrupt.

395
00:22:20,401 --> 00:22:22,534
I know you're out celebrating
that cold case.

396
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:25,134
No, I am not following you.

397
00:22:25,668 --> 00:22:27,632
Listen, Mike, I need you to meet
me at the Empire Hotel tonight.

398
00:22:27,633 --> 00:22:30,067
I'll explain everything there.
It's urgent.

399
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,834
Yeah, it's one of those cases.
But I gotta tell you, this one is stnge,
even for me.

400
00:22:35,568 --> 00:22:36,633
Thank you.

401
00:22:46,634 --> 00:22:47,766
A magic box?

402
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:50,833
And you're re-living
the same day over and over?

403
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:52,499
I told you it was
strange, even for me.

404
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:55,800
Actually, the only thing
that would be strange is
if there was nothing strange.

405
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,267
Look at you.
You're learning.

406
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,617
Vicki, I went to bed last
night, I woke up this morning.
Today is today.

407
00:23:01,618 --> 00:23:03,534
- Yeah, for the fourth time.
- It can't be.

408
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:05,034
>> How do you know?
>> Because.

409
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,399
How do you know
it's not four times?

410
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,599
How do you know
it's not a hundred?

411
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,100
How do you know that it doesn't
keep happening until fate
gets everything straight?

412
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:16,834
Mike, he's the guy
who had the box!

413
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:21,100
He's dead.

414
00:23:28,067 --> 00:23:30,634
Darryl Forman.
You know him?

415
00:23:30,967 --> 00:23:33,000
Sort of.
I mean, he's the guy

416
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:35,034
who's supposed
to be selling the box.

417
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:39,201
Well, if he's selling it and
the two buyers are corralled back at your office,

418
00:23:39,234 --> 00:23:40,794
- who the hell has it?
- I don't know.

419
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:44,434
Oh, wait...
There was another guy
back at Benoit's office.

420
00:23:44,434 --> 00:23:46,134
He was dressed
in a janitor's uniform.

421
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:48,134
Henry and I saw him before
we stopped the other murder.

422
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:49,144
another murder?

423
00:23:49,201 --> 00:23:52,000
- We already stopped it.
- You stopped a murder?t.

424
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:54,766
- Mike, stay with me.
- Hey, I have to call this in.

425
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,901
Come on!

426
00:23:55,907 --> 00:23:56,864
Vicki!

427
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,967
- That's him!
- Police!

428
00:24:15,401 --> 00:24:16,534
Hold it right there!

429
00:24:18,168 --> 00:24:19,800
Drop the briefcase!

430
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:29,166
What are you doing?
I didn't do anything.

431
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:31,011
Well, you've got nothing
to worry about then.

432
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:37,333
Vicki...

433
00:24:45,067 --> 00:24:45,933
DON'T DO IT!

434
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,222
DON'T OPEN IT!

435
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:57,767
Vick?

436
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,967
- DON'T LOOK AT IT!
- Vicki?

437
00:25:14,067 --> 00:25:16,600
Okay, your half hour's...up?

438
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:29,400
Have you ever seen this symbol?

439
00:25:30,033 --> 00:25:32,100
Maybe... I can't place it, though.

440
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:33,800
Okay, I need you
to do some research.

441
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:36,733
Find out whatever connection it
might have to some kind of box.

442
00:25:37,767 --> 00:25:39,800
A guy named Jacob Keller
is going to come in here

443
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:41,733
looking for me.
Don't worry, Henry's on his way.

444
00:25:41,767 --> 00:25:43,368
He will help.

445
00:25:43,401 --> 00:25:44,368
Phone...

446
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:49,068
My goblet! I knew you hated it.

447
00:25:49,069 --> 00:25:52,000
You know what?I don't hate it.
Okay, I'm sorry I broke the goblet.

448
00:25:52,016 --> 00:25:56,233
But listen, fate is not going to beat us.
We are going to live our day the way we want it to.

449
00:25:56,234 --> 00:25:56,999
Am I right?

450
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,167
- Yes?
- Right! Good!

451
00:26:06,207 --> 00:26:09,121
Nonsense. How could something
so beautiful be dangerous?

452
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:11,366
You have no idea what
you're getting yourself into.

453
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:12,733
How could you
possibly know this?

454
00:26:13,267 --> 00:26:14,867
- Where is it?
- I don't have it!

455
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,534
- I don't have it.
- Where is it?

456
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:19,267
- Drop the knife!
- No, no, no.

457
00:26:19,301 --> 00:26:21,700
- You don't even understand.
- No, you don't understand.

458
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,422
Drop it!

459
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,677
It's the bloody janitor!

460
00:26:32,001 --> 00:26:33,800
And don't think I'm not
going to press charges.

461
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,800
- Vicki said...
- I don't care what she said!

462
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:37,034
I have to be on my way.

463
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:40,201
- You're not going anywhere.
- She'll be here any minute

464
00:26:40,234 --> 00:26:41,934
and I know she really wants to talk to you.

465
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,740
Why would she want to talk to me?
I don't even know her.

466
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:46,201
Sit... down!

467
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:58,668
Okay, so Vicki woke up babbling
about a broken goblet, fate,

468
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,268
and told you to keep him
here, and then ran out.

469
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,310
I think she's finally snapped.

470
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,700
Vicki Nelson Investigations.

471
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:11,133
Hey Coreen, it's me.
I need you to get Henry
toring Keller down to the station.

472
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:12,933
Okay.Is everything all right?

473
00:27:12,967 --> 00:27:14,334
Yeah, I'm okay.

474
00:27:15,007 --> 00:27:16,384
Did you find anything
about that symbol?

475
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,900
Oh, yeah.
It's a symbol for a secret
society called the Knights of Babylon.

476
00:27:21,567 --> 00:27:23,000
The Knights of Babylon?

477
00:27:23,034 --> 00:27:25,133
One of your lesser
known secret societies.

478
00:27:25,167 --> 00:27:27,367
They're not sure exactly when
they were started,

479
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:31,820
but a lot of the legends say it was
in the 15th century when they came into possession of -
listen to this -

480
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:33,434
Pandora's Box.

481
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:36,447
Pandora's Box?
As in...Pandora's Box?

482
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,501
- The one and only.
- The one Zeus gave her and told her never to open.

483
00:27:39,504 --> 00:27:42,700
But she did and released all
the misfortunes of mankind.

484
00:27:43,033 --> 00:27:45,528
Just once...once...
couldn't a myth be a myth?

485
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,304
I've been reading up on it.
A lot of scholars say it
wasn't Pandora's fault.

486
00:27:49,305 --> 00:27:53,450
They say there's no living
creature that can handle the box
without giving in to the
temptation to open it.

487
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,100
I think we can prove them
wrong on that one, though,

488
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:58,367
I mean, who would be dumb
enough to unleash a tidal wave of evil into the world?

489
00:27:59,001 --> 00:28:01,934
Yeah...who'd do that?

490
00:28:02,467 --> 00:28:05,967
- How do you know Benoit?
- Who's Benoit?

491
00:28:06,901 --> 00:28:08,934
How about the guy you
were planning to kill?

492
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,501
I wasn't going
to hurt anybody.

493
00:28:10,734 --> 00:28:11,547
Right.

494
00:28:12,401 --> 00:28:16,434
You were just coming for
a visit and forgot you happened
to have a knife in your hand.
Is that it?

495
00:28:19,113 --> 00:28:20,434
What were you doing
in his office?

496
00:28:21,247 --> 00:28:22,234
What office?

497
00:28:24,167 --> 00:28:25,334
You do realize we're just
going to keep doing this

498
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:28,174
over and over until you
give me some answers.

499
00:28:32,657 --> 00:28:33,801
How do you know Benoit?

500
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,567
Get anything on
that name I gave you?

501
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,434
Yeah, Darryl Forman.

502
00:28:50,368 --> 00:28:51,733
He graduated top of his class,

503
00:28:52,567 --> 00:28:55,200
did some military service in
Europe, and then disappeared off the books.

504
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,799
There are records of border
crossings here and there,

505
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,067
but for the most part, he's an enigma.

506
00:29:00,301 --> 00:29:01,400
Just like this one.

507
00:29:04,734 --> 00:29:05,400
Vicki, I don't
know how you...

508
00:29:05,401 --> 00:29:07,833
I don't care if you
and Mike go out for drinks.

509
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,837
But...
you just....

510
00:29:19,687 --> 00:29:21,054
Thanks.

511
00:29:24,187 --> 00:29:26,013
Was Mike going to
ask me out?

512
00:29:27,887 --> 00:29:29,020
I don't know.

513
00:29:30,884 --> 00:29:32,621
What Mike does is
his business, right?

514
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,587
I'm charging him
with assault, but I have
no proof of attempted murder.

515
00:29:53,004 --> 00:29:54,554
You have proof.
You have me.

516
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:57,321
I saw him die...
twice.

517
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,387
Right, because...

518
00:30:00,521 --> 00:30:02,854
Because you're re-living
the same day.

519
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:05,321
You really think that's
going to hold up, do you?

520
00:30:06,654 --> 00:30:07,853
Where are Fournier
and Keller?

521
00:30:07,854 --> 00:30:09,353
They're being
released right now.

522
00:30:09,354 --> 00:30:11,454
Mike, you can't do that!
I told you what they did.

523
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:13,720
Vicki, what am I supposed
to do?

524
00:30:14,253 --> 00:30:16,665
Hold him overnight?
At least until I get the box.

525
00:30:16,666 --> 00:30:19,586
The laws haven't changed
since you left the job, okay?

526
00:30:19,587 --> 00:30:23,087
I need to be able to
charge him with something, and buying antiques
isn't a crime.

527
00:30:23,854 --> 00:30:25,087
Well, it didn't use to be.

528
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,320
this has all gone wrong.

529
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:33,353
Look, if you need me,
I will be at the Empire Hotel.

530
00:30:33,354 --> 00:30:35,754
It's going to hit the fan at
midnight and I need to be there.

531
00:30:39,787 --> 00:30:41,355
Okay, hold up.

532
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,717
I'm coming with you.

533
00:30:46,521 --> 00:30:47,954
I don't know why.

534
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,320
Okay, so everything else
you've called has come true.

535
00:30:58,354 --> 00:31:01,219
The woman dropping the tray, the
guy whistling at the front desk.

536
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,319
Even finding a free parking
space in this part of town.

537
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,120
Now that's eerie.

538
00:31:04,703 --> 00:31:09,054
So basically we can expect
to see this Forman guy walk
through that door any minute now.

539
00:31:09,104 --> 00:31:10,307
No, not any minute.

540
00:31:11,721 --> 00:31:12,570
This minute.

541
00:31:13,254 --> 00:31:15,210
Okay, hey, hey, hey!
That's far enough.

542
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:18,320
- Drop the briefcase.
- Carefully.

543
00:31:34,054 --> 00:31:34,854
Mike!

544
00:31:39,054 --> 00:31:40,054
Mike?

545
00:31:41,187 --> 00:31:42,087
MIKE!

546
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,987
Mike!
Mike!

547
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:53,910
Mike?

548
00:31:58,543 --> 00:32:01,310
Come on, you're getting blood
all over your lucky tie.

549
00:32:02,744 --> 00:32:04,544
Yeah...

550
00:32:12,311 --> 00:32:13,344
Mike...

551
00:32:14,877 --> 00:32:17,443
Hey...
Hey...Mike...

552
00:32:18,477 --> 00:32:20,810
Mike! Mike!

553
00:32:28,344 --> 00:32:29,111
Mike...!

554
00:32:31,244 --> 00:32:32,244
Bring me the box!

555
00:32:32,278 --> 00:32:34,311
- What?
- I can go back!

556
00:32:34,344 --> 00:32:35,678
I can change this!

557
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:38,344
Who's to say the same thing
won't happen over again?

558
00:32:38,378 --> 00:32:39,943
Because, I won't let it!

559
00:32:40,577 --> 00:32:43,811
If it weren't for me,
he'd...he'd be alive!

560
00:32:45,244 --> 00:32:48,544
He'd have gone out with Kate.
He would have had a chance to be happy.

561
00:32:48,678 --> 00:32:50,744
There are some things
you can't change, Vicki.

562
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:52,877
There's not!

563
00:32:53,611 --> 00:32:56,311
- Nothing is preordained.
- What do you want to do?

564
00:32:56,344 --> 00:32:58,877
You want to keep opening the
box until everything is okay?

565
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:01,031
I have the box.
We've won.

566
00:33:02,344 --> 00:33:05,478
No, we haven't.
Not like this.

567
00:33:09,378 --> 00:33:11,990
Please, please...

568
00:33:14,810 --> 00:33:16,237
Please.

569
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:21,877
You'd die for him,
wouldn't you?

570
00:33:22,911 --> 00:33:24,477
Please.

571
00:33:59,844 --> 00:34:02,044
- Okay, your ...
- ...half hour's up.

572
00:34:02,277 --> 00:34:03,434
I know.

573
00:34:06,777 --> 00:34:09,011
Here's the Ackerman file.

574
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,009
- Yeah, Cellucci.
- Mike?

575
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,710
Hey, Vick.
Vicki, are you all right?

576
00:34:26,744 --> 00:34:30,277
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, you wearing that tie?

577
00:34:30,311 --> 00:34:33,510
The one I gave you the night we
cracked that triple homicide in Cabbagetown?

578
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,651
Yeah, I am.

579
00:34:36,044 --> 00:34:37,881
The one after the
triple homicide.

580
00:34:38,944 --> 00:34:39,810
What's going on?

581
00:34:42,544 --> 00:34:45,277
Nothing I just
... I gotta go.

582
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:47,977
I'll call you soon, okay?

583
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,177
No, Vicki, wait.

584
00:34:52,011 --> 00:34:55,544
Hey, have a good time tonight ok?

585
00:34:56,643 --> 00:34:57,377
Vick!

586
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:08,477
Hey Mike, what do you
say we head to Lavey's for a few drinks after work?

587
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,710
Celebrate breaking the Nicholls homicide?

588
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:12,410
Yeah, sure, why not.

589
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:14,324
Nice tie.

590
00:35:17,177 --> 00:35:18,144
Thanks.

591
00:35:26,477 --> 00:35:28,444
Coreen, I'm giving you the
rest of the day off, okay?

592
00:35:28,477 --> 00:35:30,576
Go home.
Get out of here as soon as
you can and don't come back.

593
00:35:30,577 --> 00:35:31,486
But I was just about to...

594
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:32,710
Do it at home.

595
00:35:36,244 --> 00:35:36,951
Cool.

596
00:35:40,514 --> 00:35:42,514
And I'm taking your
meeting at the Empire Hotel.

597
00:35:42,577 --> 00:35:43,610
He's going to keep you safe.

598
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:45,310
What do you
mean, 'keep me safe'?

599
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:22,127
Well....

600
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,177
Gotcha.

601
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:32,577
Board Room.
Here we go.

602
00:36:43,077 --> 00:36:46,410
Hi. Sorry, I just got to drop
these off for the conference tomorrow.

603
00:36:46,510 --> 00:36:48,443
Put it down and get out.

604
00:36:48,477 --> 00:36:49,710
Sure.

605
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:52,843
- Where is it?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

606
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,077
The box!

607
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:56,611
Enough people have died.
I don't mind making it one more.

608
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:09,747
You have no idea
what you've done.

609
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,677
- How many people you've hurt.
- Put the box down.

610
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:13,177
This has nothing to do with you.

611
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,477
It sure does.

612
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:17,438
You're one of them.

613
00:37:18,511 --> 00:37:20,888
You both are.
I know all about it.

614
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,310
I know all about Pandora's Box
and the Knights of Babylon.

615
00:37:23,311 --> 00:37:26,111
Then you know that it has
go back to where it belongs.

616
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:29,410
Our Order has been protecting
it for hundreds of years.

617
00:37:29,544 --> 00:37:31,044
And what's a few dead
bodies along the way, huh?

618
00:37:31,277 --> 00:37:32,610
To save it from
the rest of the world,

619
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:34,677
I'd say one or two
bodies are worth it.

620
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:35,544
Why does he have it?

621
00:37:35,577 --> 00:37:38,644
He professed to have
a vocation and was brought
into the fold.

622
00:37:38,977 --> 00:37:43,097
But all he was doing was biding
his time until he got close
enough to the box to steal it.

623
00:37:43,811 --> 00:37:45,510
He betrayed a sacred trust.

624
00:37:45,543 --> 00:37:47,276
Don't do it!
Put the gun down!

625
00:37:47,277 --> 00:37:49,543
I told you, this has
nothing to do with you.

626
00:37:49,577 --> 00:37:52,277
It does, all right?
I've opened it.

627
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,967
I saw myself and
everyone I know, die.

628
00:37:55,610 --> 00:37:58,511
Then what's coming next
won't be a huge shock to you.

629
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,992
I'd never open it!
I've been trained!

630
00:38:07,577 --> 00:38:08,444
Just the same...

631
00:38:10,777 --> 00:38:11,777
I really don't care.

632
00:38:12,511 --> 00:38:14,311
It goes where I know
it will be safe.

633
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:21,344
- How can he do that?
- He's not opening it.

634
00:38:22,107 --> 00:38:23,978
No living person
can resist it.

635
00:38:25,911 --> 00:38:28,444
He falls into an entirely
different category.

636
00:38:42,404 --> 00:38:45,277
I'll be happy when this
is sealed up in the wall of my apartment.

637
00:38:45,644 --> 00:38:48,278
- It's been a long day.
- I know.

638
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,777
- And I haven't ...
- ...even fed yet.

639
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:53,078
I know.

640
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:56,911
I wanted to thank you for
everything you did today.

641
00:38:58,244 --> 00:39:00,210
Everything you did in the
last few hours...

642
00:39:01,044 --> 00:39:02,111
days...

643
00:39:03,244 --> 00:39:04,010
day.

644
00:39:08,044 --> 00:39:11,571
tell you the truth,
I don't have experience of anything except this last time.

645
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,244
You ended the world for me.

646
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:21,410
Because you believed
I could bring it back.

647
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,277
You trusted me.

648
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:27,144
Trust can be
extremely stimulating.

649
00:39:29,678 --> 00:39:30,844
It can at that.

650
00:39:33,111 --> 00:39:34,410
Do you mind?

651
00:39:55,811 --> 00:39:57,943
- What time is it?
- Five to six.

652
00:39:59,877 --> 00:40:00,910
I know...

653
00:40:01,443 --> 00:40:03,243
you've been sleeping all day,
but I didn't want to wake you.

654
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,711
It looks like you had
a late one last night.

655
00:40:06,044 --> 00:40:07,044
Yeah.

656
00:40:08,077 --> 00:40:09,411
Is that today's paper?

657
00:40:09,944 --> 00:40:10,877
Yeah?

658
00:40:17,844 --> 00:40:19,010
Finally.

659
00:40:34,227 --> 00:40:34,877
Vick?

660
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:38,444
- Um...I'm going ...
- Yeah.

661
00:40:41,077 --> 00:40:42,110
Vick?

662
00:40:44,944 --> 00:40:47,117
Hey, you okay?

663
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:51,374
You sounded a little
frazzled on the phone there
when we spoke.

664
00:40:53,678 --> 00:40:57,781
Did you ever have one
of those days that you wish
you could just reset
and start over?

665
00:40:59,543 --> 00:41:00,774
All the time.

666
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,744
Well, I had one of those.

667
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:08,643
Well, I'm glad
that you're okay now.

668
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:11,514
You kind of had
me worried there.

669
00:41:17,277 --> 00:41:18,811
How was your date?

670
00:41:19,044 --> 00:41:21,447
- My date?
- With Kate.

671
00:41:23,010 --> 00:41:27,678
Oh, we just...had some drinks
to celebrate solving the case.

672
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:29,632
I mean, it wasn't a date,
it was just ...

673
00:41:30,378 --> 00:41:32,111
...two cops having a drink.

674
00:41:32,344 --> 00:41:33,743
Exactly.

675
00:41:36,311 --> 00:41:37,090
What?

676
00:41:37,543 --> 00:41:40,911
I just came by to tell you
that I'm happy you're okay.

677
00:41:45,443 --> 00:41:46,778
Thanks.

678
00:41:48,410 --> 00:41:50,377
You know, it's good seeing
you around here.

679
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,400
It's like nothing
ever changes, huh?

680
00:41:55,078 --> 00:41:56,561
Almost nothing.

00:42:11,878 --> 00:42:23,804
