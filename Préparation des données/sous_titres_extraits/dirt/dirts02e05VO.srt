<i>Previously on Dirt...</i>

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,119
I didn't invite you here
for a story, either.

3
00:00:04,239 --> 00:00:05,967
- Really?
- Really. I wanted to see you.

4
00:00:06,852 --> 00:00:08,678
That Ted Rothman, he likes you.

5
00:00:09,006 --> 00:00:11,473
- Good to see you, Lucy.
- It's good to see you, Ted.

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,641
I gotta go.

7
00:00:13,272 --> 00:00:15,560
Wait. Are you sure? Come on.

8
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:17,395
We can't do this, Holt.

9
00:00:17,722 --> 00:00:19,773
Don, your brother's been
in a car accident.

10
00:00:19,933 --> 00:00:20,940
How bad is it?

11
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,067
Hey, Jason.

12
00:00:22,412 --> 00:00:24,360
It must be bad if you're here.

13
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:26,776
Congratulations, guys.
You did great.

14
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,908
Drink up, go home
and have some terrific sex.

15
00:00:31,986 --> 00:00:35,038
What, you two haven't done it yet?
Sorry.

16
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,832
Sharlee Cates would be
a great get now.

17
00:00:38,618 --> 00:00:39,626
Get it, Don!

18
00:00:41,413 --> 00:00:42,462
Friggin'move!

19
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:44,806
I want you to meet someone.

20
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:46,758
This is Don Konkey.

21
00:00:46,918 --> 00:00:47,801
Hi, Sharlee.

22
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:50,909
Don's gonna be
your personal photographer.

23
00:00:51,029 --> 00:00:52,818
He'll need unfettered access.

24
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:54,641
That means lots.

25
00:00:55,301 --> 00:00:57,987
Season 2 Episode 5
<i>What Is This Thing Called...</i>

26
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,597
Are you kidding me?

27
00:01:00,717 --> 00:01:03,400
Paul Slatkin gets
a 20-million-dollar deal.

28
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:07,800
Do you remember that party
he had on his boat in the marina?

29
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:10,740
Jews are not sailors.

30
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:11,600
No.

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,191
Even I know that,
and I'm only half a Jew.

32
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,971
Poor guy.
Didn't even see the mast coming.

33
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:21,495
Yeah. He was too busy staring
at Jessica Biel's porthole.

34
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:30,207
Go ahead. Get it.

35
00:01:30,327 --> 00:01:32,264
- I don't need to get it.
- Yeah, right.

36
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:33,179
What?

37
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:34,953
I know you wanna get it.

38
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:37,202
- I'm fine.
- Just embrace it. It's okay.

39
00:01:37,322 --> 00:01:39,965
- Come on. Let's see who it is.
- I don't care.

40
00:01:40,375 --> 00:01:41,771
Really? It's Don.

41
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,323
- Hey. What's up?
- Hi, Lucy.

42
00:01:45,804 --> 00:01:47,819
Roy Toy's moving out on Sharlee.

43
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,738
There's a bunch of guys here
loading up a truck.

44
00:01:49,898 --> 00:01:52,139
Did she tell you that?
Are you alone there?

45
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:55,710
No. I think Roy Toy
might've leaked it to...

46
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,878
a few other guys.

47
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:01,499
Look, I gotta go.

48
00:02:05,334 --> 00:02:06,421
Bananas.

52
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:25,511
- She's never this late.
- Do you think she got laid?

53
00:02:25,631 --> 00:02:26,711
Yes, I did.

54
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,568
Anybody else? Show hands?

55
00:02:29,427 --> 00:02:30,284
I did.

56
00:02:30,688 --> 00:02:33,818
- Alan, you're lying.
- Hey, Thai massages should count.

57
00:02:33,938 --> 00:02:35,908
Anything new on
the Roy Toy/Sharlee split?

58
00:02:36,028 --> 00:02:37,327
Roy Toy and Sharlee split?

59
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that,
because you make terrific brownies.

60
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,500
Somebody find out why he would leak
something so personal.

61
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,073
- I'll take it.
- No, I got it.

62
00:02:45,193 --> 00:02:47,921
When he did that shitty rap album,
I did a piece on him.

63
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:49,636
Roy Toy's no boy toy.

64
00:02:49,756 --> 00:02:52,260
Does Dr. Seuss know
you're plagiarizing him?

65
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,262
Look, Roy thinks that I love him,
which means that he loves me.

66
00:02:55,382 --> 00:02:56,882
I've already left him a message
on his cell phone.

67
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:58,556
- He'll call back.
- Good luck with that.

68
00:02:58,716 --> 00:03:01,667
- Believe me, he'll call me back.
- If he doesn't, Farber's on it.

69
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:05,074
In other news, we have
Genevieve Fair and Zach Baer.

70
00:03:06,891 --> 00:03:08,199
Fantastic picture,

71
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,761
but tragic,
because it's not our cover.

72
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:12,312
Who took this? A seagull?

73
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:14,167
Camille?

74
00:03:14,571 --> 00:03:17,492
- I know how to do my job.
- You're a ray of sunshine, aren't you?

75
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:18,660
I do what I can.

76
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,245
Those two together? No. No way.

77
00:03:20,405 --> 00:03:22,121
- I mean, that's gotta be Photoshopped.
- It isn't.

78
00:03:22,281 --> 00:03:23,832
I checked. Look, the pixels match.

79
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:25,385
Either way, it's fantastic.

80
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:27,711
They just got done doing
that movie Shock together.

81
00:03:27,831 --> 00:03:29,202
This is PR. It's gotta be PR.

82
00:03:29,322 --> 00:03:31,327
No, the guy's a clown.
Don't you remember?

83
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:33,336
We couldn't run
any of those photos of him.

84
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:35,718
The one with no pants,
and when he used an apple as a bong.

85
00:03:37,422 --> 00:03:38,972
God, it hurt not to use those.

86
00:03:39,311 --> 00:03:40,687
Genevieve is gorgeous.

87
00:03:40,807 --> 00:03:43,101
She's got a serious career.
She makes boatloads of cash.

88
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:46,557
She could have anybody she wants.
Why would she be with that tool?

89
00:03:46,677 --> 00:03:48,523
Excuse me.
Just a point of clarification.

90
00:03:48,683 --> 00:03:49,738
Yes, Professor.

91
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:52,184
Does everybody here believe
that these two couldn't be together

92
00:03:52,304 --> 00:03:54,028
solely based
on their physical appearance?

93
00:03:54,304 --> 00:03:55,429
Yes. Yes. Yes.

94
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:57,574
That is completely superficial.

95
00:03:57,734 --> 00:03:59,201
Then, you're on the story.

96
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:01,509
Prove all of us
superficial people wrong.

97
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:02,453
What else?

98
00:04:02,717 --> 00:04:04,934
A valet at the Mondrian told me
that Holt McLaren

99
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:07,458
left there last night at 3:30 am
with Danica Ramos.

100
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:10,871
And he's shooting a movie.

101
00:04:10,991 --> 00:04:13,673
You know, only a guy could do that
and still look good for a 6:00 am call.

102
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:16,559
Well, let's see if it's serious
with Senorita Ramos,

103
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,595
or is he just enjoying a soft taco?

104
00:04:22,172 --> 00:04:23,839
You make lousy cappuccino.

105
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,129
Excuse me.

106
00:04:26,249 --> 00:04:28,618
I worked at Starbucks
all through college.

107
00:04:28,738 --> 00:04:31,906
I didn't realize that cosmetology school
was now considered college.

108
00:04:32,736 --> 00:04:33,746
I'm sorry.

109
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:35,370
Somebody a little bent out of shape

110
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,247
because he didn't get
to do to boy toy story?

111
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,367
Absolutely not.

112
00:04:38,491 --> 00:04:39,813
I am perfectly happy

113
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:42,654
with the complex human mystery
that is Zach and Genevieve,

114
00:04:42,774 --> 00:04:44,434
and I look forward
to proving you wrong.

115
00:04:44,554 --> 00:04:46,623
You know what?
My opinion is hardly superficial.

116
00:04:46,783 --> 00:04:49,542
Nine times out of 10, good-looking
people screw good-looking people.

117
00:04:51,123 --> 00:04:53,378
But I can't wait to be proven right.

118
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,747
Check the crew list of Shock.

119
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,842
Women talk to makeup,
men talk to hair,

120
00:04:58,002 --> 00:04:59,811
and everybody talks to craft service.

121
00:05:00,088 --> 00:05:02,499
Thank you very much,
but I have a better lead.

122
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:05,391
I'm sorry. Is that idea
too superficial for you?

123
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:08,076
I found Zach's ex-girlfriend.

124
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:10,711
- Goes a little deeper.
- You know what? I'm shocked

125
00:05:10,831 --> 00:05:13,201
that you would want to talk
to anybody's ex-girlfriend,

126
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:14,795
but that explains your pissy mood.

127
00:05:14,915 --> 00:05:17,651
In the last week, I have crashed
on two crappy foldout couches

128
00:05:17,771 --> 00:05:20,128
and shared one with
a 15-year-old Pomeranian named Larry,

129
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:22,232
who wants to mate with my ankle.

130
00:05:24,425 --> 00:05:25,828
You know what? Call Lili Steiner.

131
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:27,747
She's a realtor and a source,

132
00:05:27,907 --> 00:05:30,399
but she hasn't gotten me
anything in a while, so...

133
00:05:30,519 --> 00:05:31,816
she owes me.

134
00:05:33,261 --> 00:05:36,214
- That's very nice of you.
- Now you owe me, too.

135
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:41,135
McPherson.

136
00:05:42,179 --> 00:05:43,137
Hi, Roy.

137
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:45,128
Yes.

138
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,059
Yes, I would like to see you.

139
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:52,146
The photographer's name
is Graham Duncan.

140
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:54,065
These are amazing. And he'royalty.

141
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,359
His mother is, like,
the duchess of something.

142
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:57,871
Doesn't that make him a lord?

143
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,385
All I know is that he used to work
for the London Times.

144
00:06:00,505 --> 00:06:02,323
- Hey, lover.
- Hey, Camille.

145
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:05,686
Hey, Lucy.

146
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:08,284
Who took these?

147
00:06:08,854 --> 00:06:10,925
His name is Graham Duncan.
He's a Brit.

148
00:06:11,045 --> 00:06:12,986
Yeah, yeah. I heard of him.

149
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:15,705
- You gonna use them?
- I don't know. We'll see.

150
00:06:15,987 --> 00:06:18,652
So what do you know
about the Roy Toy split?

151
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,548
She didn't know nothin'.

152
00:06:20,935 --> 00:06:22,174
What do you mean?

153
00:06:22,294 --> 00:06:24,746
You didn't notice anything off
between the two of them?

154
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,432
If she doesn't know,
how can I know?

155
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:30,935
Because you are brilliant
and instinctive.

156
00:06:31,542 --> 00:06:32,937
Not so much anymore.

157
00:06:33,097 --> 00:06:35,568
Come on. Don't give me
that bullshit about the drugs again.

158
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:38,946
I put you there so you could find out
what's really going on.

159
00:06:40,914 --> 00:06:42,822
I'm not a reporter, Lucy, you know?

160
00:06:43,483 --> 00:06:45,986
Don, you record other
people's conversations all the time.

161
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:48,786
All I'm asking you to do is record
your own conversation with Sharlee.

162
00:06:48,946 --> 00:06:50,288
It doesn't feel right.

163
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:51,706
Make it feel right!

164
00:06:52,668 --> 00:06:54,208
That's not very nice.

165
00:06:55,716 --> 00:06:56,878
Hey, Lucy, Ted Roth...

166
00:06:57,038 --> 00:06:58,546
- Not now.
- Okay.

167
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,137
How come you're not talking to him?

168
00:07:01,257 --> 00:07:02,800
Please don't change the subject.

169
00:07:03,304 --> 00:07:06,100
Everyone and their mother
wants to get to Sharlee.

170
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,390
You already have her.
She likes you, Don.

171
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:11,434
So just get her to talk.

172
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,139
This is... It's... It's just so good.

173
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:16,795
Don't take away my fun.

174
00:07:24,106 --> 00:07:26,426
Look, I didn't wanna leave,
but I had to.

175
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,102
I love Sharlee,
but she's crazy, dude.

176
00:07:29,222 --> 00:07:30,620
I can't leave Romy with her.

177
00:07:30,965 --> 00:07:33,051
She is kind of young to be a mother.

178
00:07:33,171 --> 00:07:36,017
It's no excuse.
She takes her to clubs at 3:00 am.

179
00:07:36,137 --> 00:07:38,294
What kind of
a mother does shit like that?

180
00:07:39,152 --> 00:07:41,297
I don't know.
The kind of mother she had.

181
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:43,156
But when you grow up with that,

182
00:07:43,276 --> 00:07:46,921
you either repeat that crap or you prove
to yourself you can do better.

183
00:07:48,047 --> 00:07:49,834
I really thought she could.

184
00:07:51,045 --> 00:07:53,102
She wanted so much to have a kid.

185
00:07:57,748 --> 00:07:59,051
I'm so sorry.

186
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,610
What am I supposed to do now?

187
00:08:04,111 --> 00:08:06,030
Are you gonna try for full custody?

188
00:08:06,484 --> 00:08:07,484
I have to.

189
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,201
She smokes way too much weed.

190
00:08:10,485 --> 00:08:13,284
She thinks she's here to infuse
the world with her magic.

191
00:08:15,895 --> 00:08:17,140
She kind of has.

192
00:08:17,422 --> 00:08:18,292
Kind of.

193
00:08:20,719 --> 00:08:22,417
She's too out there now.

194
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:24,509
It's brutal, man,

195
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:27,844
seeing somebody you love over the edge
and not being able to help them.

196
00:08:30,156 --> 00:08:33,099
You know, people are gonna think
that this is about money.

197
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:34,548
Are you kidding?

198
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,620
Look at the prenup.

199
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,599
I'd make a hell of a lot more money
if I stayed with her.

200
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,262
But it isn't about me.

201
00:08:41,838 --> 00:08:43,127
It's about Romy.

202
00:08:43,737 --> 00:08:44,944
God! Which reminds me.

203
00:08:45,104 --> 00:08:47,947
I have to pick up my other kids
from their mother's.

204
00:08:48,107 --> 00:08:49,958
Here's the latest cut
from my new CD.

205
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:51,686
- Thanks.
- Enjoy.

206
00:08:54,036 --> 00:08:55,456
"Whassup, Toy."

207
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,030
Nice.

208
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,575
I'm not crazy.

209
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:03,746
I'm not. You know that, right?

210
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,257
I know crazy, and you're not it.

211
00:09:08,525 --> 00:09:10,921
Get your ass off that wall!

212
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,818
You know you're just giving them
what they want when you do that.

213
00:09:14,938 --> 00:09:16,632
I don't care. They're just

214
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:19,718
pissed that you're in here,
and they're not.

215
00:09:22,141 --> 00:09:24,108
Why is Roy talking shit about me?

216
00:09:24,593 --> 00:09:25,719
He was the one

217
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:28,821
who talked me into taking Romy
into that club.

218
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,793
He did that, not me.

219
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,152
I admit it.

220
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:35,160
I smoke pot.

221
00:09:35,656 --> 00:09:36,837
He grows it.

222
00:09:38,595 --> 00:09:39,917
Do you want some?

223
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:42,931
No, thank you. It makes me stupid.

224
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:46,964
He's having an affair.

225
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,102
I know he is.

226
00:09:53,001 --> 00:09:56,307
He comes home in the middle
of the day smelling like soap.

227
00:09:56,901 --> 00:09:58,862
He's taking a shower somewhere.

228
00:10:00,885 --> 00:10:04,640
And that's what he used to do
before he would go home to Debbie Ann.

229
00:10:08,979 --> 00:10:10,738
What did I do to make him
hate me so much?

230
00:10:11,705 --> 00:10:13,266
He's left two marriages.

231
00:10:13,386 --> 00:10:15,079
You know, it's a pattern.

232
00:10:15,199 --> 00:10:16,486
It's not you.

233
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:19,455
Donkey, will you help me?

234
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,137
You're my friend.

235
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:24,145
Will you find out
who he left me for?

236
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:29,564
You wanna know
how I found out he was leaving?

237
00:10:30,782 --> 00:10:33,212
I'm coming out
of the pet store, and...

238
00:10:33,881 --> 00:10:36,643
a bunch of papparassholes
blocked me, shouting,

239
00:10:36,763 --> 00:10:38,266
"Sharlee, Sharlee, Sharlee,"

240
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:40,969
"how does it feel
to be a single mom?"

241
00:10:46,909 --> 00:10:49,068
I don't want to find out that way.

242
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:57,706
I will. I'll help you.

243
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:02,361
Just promise that you'll tell me
before it gets printed.

244
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:03,537
I will.

245
00:11:10,986 --> 00:11:12,020
Promise.

246
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:16,326
Promise.

247
00:11:26,798 --> 00:11:29,752
{\a3}<i>- Hello, Jason.
- Hey, Don. You working?</i>

248
00:11:29,872 --> 00:11:32,845
Yeah, I'm outside
Roy Toy Manning's ex-wife's house,

249
00:11:32,965 --> 00:11:34,447
waiting for him to pop out.

250
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:36,407
Like a cuckoo clock?

251
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:39,452
Yeah, kind of. How you feelin'?

252
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:42,325
Well, they're releasing me.

253
00:11:42,789 --> 00:11:45,067
I got the scaffolding off my face, but

254
00:11:45,459 --> 00:11:47,209
it still hurts like hell.

255
00:11:47,345 --> 00:11:48,961
I just drank a hamburger.

256
00:11:50,935 --> 00:11:53,924
- April taking you home?
<i>- No, she's in Philadelphia.</i>

257
00:11:54,084 --> 00:11:56,957
Her dad fell off a ladder.
Now he's in the hospital.

258
00:11:57,257 --> 00:11:58,763
A stellar week for her.

259
00:11:58,923 --> 00:12:01,058
Well, come down here and stay with me.

260
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:03,934
I got room. I'll take care of you.

261
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:05,755
Oh, yeah?

262
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:08,189
Just take care of yourself, okay?

263
00:12:08,526 --> 00:12:11,646
<i>- Are you still getting your shots?</i>
- Yeah.

264
00:12:15,052 --> 00:12:16,697
Oh, his neck's too thick.

265
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:17,782
What?

266
00:12:17,943 --> 00:12:20,682
- Just get on a plane, okay?
<i>- I love you, Don.</i>

267
00:12:20,802 --> 00:12:23,468
Yeah, I lo... Yeah, I love you, too.
You, too.

268
00:12:57,435 --> 00:13:00,364
- Willa, it's Roy Toy.
- Yeah, I know.

269
00:13:00,484 --> 00:13:03,830
I don't trust myself for believing him.
I'm checking out his divorce lawyer.

270
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,122
He's using the same one
from his first divorce, so...

271
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:07,540
Well, let me know.

272
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:09,875
Lucy, you're on with Naomi.

273
00:13:10,036 --> 00:13:12,537
Got a call from the manager
of Swingers. Holt just got there,

274
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:14,765
he's in a booth {\making out}
with that model, Ingrid Laska.

275
00:13:14,885 --> 00:13:16,552
She's, like, 3 feet 1/2 taller than him.

276
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:18,529
She's definitely worth the climb.

277
00:13:18,649 --> 00:13:19,952
Got it, Naomi. Kenny?

278
00:13:20,072 --> 00:13:23,546
- Yeah. Ted Rothman called again.
<i>- All right. Not now. Get me Don.</i>

279
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,141
All right. Okay.

280
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:34,397
<i>- Don, Lucy. Lucy, Don.</i>
- Hi, Lucy.

281
00:13:34,517 --> 00:13:37,479
<i>- Hey, where are you?</i>
- At the park.

282
00:13:37,771 --> 00:13:40,489
He's here with his kids.
There's no sign of any girlfriend yet.

283
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,337
OK, I want you to leave Roy
and go to Swingers coffee shop.

284
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,286
Get on Holt McLaren and Ingrid Laska.

285
00:13:45,446 --> 00:13:49,024
- He'll be the one in the booster seat.
- I thought you wanted me on Sharlee.

286
00:13:49,144 --> 00:13:52,084
<i>Well, I did, and now
I want you on Holt McLaren.</i>

287
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,504
Don't do it, Lucy.

288
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:57,530
<i>It's too soon... after Julia.</i>

289
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:00,676
Don, this is a legitimate follow-up
to last week's story.

290
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:03,762
Excuse me. Do you have
a child here at the park?

291
00:14:04,853 --> 00:14:06,265
Oh, I... I gotta go.

292
00:14:06,426 --> 00:14:07,725
- Do it.
- Yeah.

293
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,064
- Which one?
<i>- Don...</i>

294
00:14:10,184 --> 00:14:11,503
I'm going. I'm going.

295
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:14,133
You better be!
And don't come back, cabrón!

296
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:15,844
Oh, God!

297
00:14:17,202 --> 00:14:20,279
- Do you love torturing people?
- Sometimes, sweetie.

298
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:23,120
- Looks like it's been a while.
- Oh, God.

299
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,925
You've never wanted
the John Waters before.

300
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:30,831
I heard you were having dinner the other
night at Matsuhisa with Ted Rothman.

301
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:34,461
- That's why I pay you the big bucks.
- That's a ghost from the past.

302
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,545
Well, the timing was right.

303
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:39,649
Well, I guess he's had it
with all the 20-year-old starlets.

304
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:41,123
Lift your leg.

305
00:14:41,637 --> 00:14:43,218
Mmm. Okay.

306
00:14:44,031 --> 00:14:46,481
- A deep breath. Here we go.
- Oh, God!

307
00:14:47,866 --> 00:14:48,891
You're good.

308
00:14:49,477 --> 00:14:51,087
What do you got for me?

309
00:14:51,207 --> 00:14:54,265
Well, I did Zach Baer's
sister yesterday.

310
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,773
The artist.

311
00:14:55,934 --> 00:14:59,401
Anyway, she told me that Zach
and Genevieve were actually doing it

312
00:14:59,562 --> 00:15:01,877
- during their love scenes.
- That's good.

313
00:15:01,997 --> 00:15:02,965
Really?

314
00:15:03,894 --> 00:15:04,953
How good?

315
00:15:05,272 --> 00:15:07,013
- Personal space.
- Sorry.

316
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:10,955
2,500, and if it checks out,
and we're the only ones, another 7,500.

317
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:14,786
- Plus 150 for the John Waters.
- All right. No problem.

318
00:15:14,906 --> 00:15:17,586
Careful, sweetie. You've only got
the John, not the Waters.

319
00:15:19,873 --> 00:15:22,811
My friend says you're selling
a'72 Firebird Trans Am.

320
00:15:23,144 --> 00:15:24,247
Yeah, sweet.

321
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:25,673
So, how's 5:30?

322
00:15:27,153 --> 00:15:29,663
Okay, perfect.
Yeah. I'll see you then.

323
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:32,226
Yes! Cameraman from Shock.

324
00:15:32,387 --> 00:15:33,570
Halfway home.

325
00:15:34,335 --> 00:15:37,110
It's too bad that you didn't
check the crew list in the first place.

326
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:38,716
You'd be home by now.

327
00:15:38,836 --> 00:15:41,694
Wow. You're really starting
to sound like my ex-girlfriend.

328
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:43,988
And I'm starting to understand
why she's an ex.

329
00:15:44,815 --> 00:15:47,658
Why are you the one moving out
when she's the one who dumped you?

330
00:15:47,819 --> 00:15:50,827
- Why is that of interest to you?
- How did you guys meet?

331
00:15:50,988 --> 00:15:53,038
She approached me in line
at Trader Joe's.

332
00:15:54,211 --> 00:15:57,084
Have you ever made a first move?
Ever?

333
00:15:59,093 --> 00:16:00,312
Okay, then.

334
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:05,725
So Sharlee has been paying
Debbie Ann $15,000 a month

335
00:16:05,845 --> 00:16:08,105
to take care of his kids
from his first marriage.

336
00:16:08,225 --> 00:16:11,248
- She feels guilty of breaking them up.
- That's a whole lot of guilt.

337
00:16:11,368 --> 00:16:13,976
Let's find out how Debbie Ann
feels about this breakup.

338
00:16:14,277 --> 00:16:17,223
Uh, hey, Lucy.
There's a gentleman in your office.

339
00:16:17,343 --> 00:16:20,232
Kenny, stop letting people in my office!

340
00:16:22,098 --> 00:16:24,528
- Somebody revive Kenny.
- I'll get back to you.

341
00:16:26,164 --> 00:16:28,268
You don't have to look any further,

342
00:16:28,602 --> 00:16:32,036
because I will deliver, darling,
that's why. You know me.

343
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:34,830
All right. No, I'll see you
on Wednesday. Thank you. Bye.

344
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,916
I'm so sorry. Sorry. Graham Duncan.

345
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:40,121
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Lucy Spiller.

346
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:41,796
Wish I could say the same.

347
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:45,507
Yeah. I tend to make myself
at home wherever I am. Sorry.

348
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:47,551
Obviously. It's a good policy.

349
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:50,721
Except for in my office.
How'd you get in the building?

350
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:54,650
I talked my way in. Don't be alarmed.
Your security is excellent.

351
00:16:56,622 --> 00:16:59,030
I heard you're a big fan of my work.

352
00:17:00,466 --> 00:17:02,570
Well, despite your entitlement issue,

353
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:05,694
I think your Icon cover with Zach
and Genevieve is extraordinary.

354
00:17:06,503 --> 00:17:08,280
I got that shot while parasailing.

355
00:17:09,187 --> 00:17:10,658
That wasn't just luck?

356
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,888
God, no. Luck is for amateurs.

357
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:14,731
Yeah, I followed them around
for 11 days.

358
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:17,498
I'm quite obsessed
with getting the ultimate shot.

359
00:17:18,012 --> 00:17:18,957
Clearly.

360
00:17:20,786 --> 00:17:23,062
About Don Konkey. He's pretty good.

361
00:17:23,664 --> 00:17:26,465
- Does he work primarily with you?
- We have an agreement.

362
00:17:26,904 --> 00:17:27,925
Oh, sweet.

363
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,678
No, no. I admire that kind of loyalty,

364
00:17:30,838 --> 00:17:33,419
but, personally,
I prefer an open relationship.

365
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:35,474
I find it much more pleasurable.

366
00:17:36,731 --> 00:17:38,675
Whatever satisfies you.

367
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:40,939
Yeah.

368
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:46,375
Okay, well, I think you and I
are gonna work together very, very well.

369
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,682
Debbie Ann.

370
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,664
- Hi.
- Hi. Um, I'm... Sorry.

371
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,856
I'm Willa McPherson with Dirt Now.

372
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:03,155
Christ on a crutch.

373
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:05,087
Could I just talk to you for one second?

374
00:18:05,804 --> 00:18:08,882
If you help me unload the car. I have
a million and one things to do today.

375
00:18:09,043 --> 00:18:12,463
- I totally understand.
- If you understood, you'd disappear.

376
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:16,976
Uh, look, you probably know Roy
better than anybody.

377
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,646
We had to come to you.

378
00:18:18,766 --> 00:18:21,222
Why do you think he would
do something like this to Sharlee?

379
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:23,562
Give me a break.
He didn't do anything to her.

380
00:18:23,682 --> 00:18:27,060
He's a very good father, and he's always
taken very good care of his kids.

381
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,515
You're not helping.

382
00:18:29,589 --> 00:18:32,722
Wasn't it Sharlee that made sure
you were taken care of?

383
00:18:33,637 --> 00:18:35,200
Yeah. So?

384
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,619
She felt bad because
she busted up our family.

385
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,412
She should feel bad.
She seduced my husband.

386
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:43,333
You can put sequins on trash,
but the trash still stinks.

387
00:18:44,802 --> 00:18:47,322
So, you don't think that Roy had

388
00:18:47,561 --> 00:18:49,465
any part in their breakup at all?

389
00:18:50,186 --> 00:18:51,361
No, I don't.

390
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:55,956
It's just that these things usually
aren't that one-sided, you know?

391
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,891
Well, this one is, Wendy.

392
00:18:59,482 --> 00:19:01,731
I don't know what happened
between the two of them,

393
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:03,211
and, frankly, I don't care.

394
00:19:03,331 --> 00:19:05,355
Sharlee is getting exactly
what she deserves.

395
00:19:07,892 --> 00:19:11,287
- What goes around comes around.
- Can I just ask one more...

396
00:19:11,407 --> 00:19:13,549
No. Leave me alone. Watch the hatch.

397
00:19:23,033 --> 00:19:24,458
She blames Sharlee?

398
00:19:25,285 --> 00:19:28,891
Roy leaves Debbie Ann, then leaves
Sharlee, and he's the victim?

399
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,400
Oh, such bullshit!

400
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,460
It's always the other woman,
never the wandering prick.

401
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,448
He's just better at working the media.

402
00:19:35,568 --> 00:19:39,181
He's working too hard to try to convince
everyone he's not having an affair.

403
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:42,351
- So find out who he's having one with.
- Well, ladies, gentlemen,

404
00:19:42,512 --> 00:19:45,854
I just had a private screening this
afternoon with a beautiful love scene

405
00:19:46,015 --> 00:19:48,055
where Zach Baer and Genevieve Fair

406
00:19:48,175 --> 00:19:50,359
were engaged in flagrante delicto.

407
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:52,194
A foreign film?

408
00:19:53,456 --> 00:19:54,446
Screwing.

409
00:19:55,219 --> 00:19:58,367
- It's hearsay unless you have a copy.
- From the guy who shot it.

410
00:19:58,528 --> 00:19:59,535
Seriously?

411
00:20:00,507 --> 00:20:03,378
Good work. Help yourself
to one of Naomi's brownies.

412
00:20:03,941 --> 00:20:06,407
Call their publicists and see
if they wanna make a statement

413
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,977
before this little tidbit goes to press.

414
00:20:10,194 --> 00:20:12,496
It was unbelievable.
The director calls "cut,"

415
00:20:12,616 --> 00:20:14,883
and they don't stop
for quite some time, right?

416
00:20:15,044 --> 00:20:17,220
- Nobody's that good an actor.
- You're welcome.

417
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,421
You know what?
I gotta go meet Lili Steiner.

418
00:20:19,541 --> 00:20:22,845
- She's gonna show me that guesthouse.
- You're welcome again.

419
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:30,148
Is that you, Donnie?

420
00:20:32,697 --> 00:20:35,568
- You've been on me all day, huh?
- Thanks for noticing.

421
00:20:35,688 --> 00:20:37,338
Give me a second, okay?

422
00:20:40,293 --> 00:20:43,110
- You're really dedicated, huh?
- Pretty much.

423
00:20:45,051 --> 00:20:46,301
What, slow week?

424
00:20:46,602 --> 00:20:48,226
There's gotta be better stories
than me around, huh?

425
00:20:48,346 --> 00:20:49,792
Whatever you do is enough.

426
00:20:50,894 --> 00:20:51,907
For who?

427
00:20:53,701 --> 00:20:54,706
Fans.

428
00:20:57,043 --> 00:20:59,260
I'm just trying to live my life, man.

429
00:20:59,814 --> 00:21:01,888
I'm just trying to take pictures of it.

430
00:21:04,395 --> 00:21:06,102
Okay. Fair enough.

431
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:14,275
If she wants to keep tabs on me,
she should do it herself.

432
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:17,714
Okay. You should tell her yourself.

433
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:24,247
Good to see you.

434
00:21:25,638 --> 00:21:28,190
Can I get a picture
of you and your friend?

435
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:30,480
She's a little camera-shy.

436
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,950
- She is?
- Yeah.

437
00:21:33,677 --> 00:21:34,953
Thanks, anyway.

438
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:42,393
I'm done.

439
00:21:43,892 --> 00:21:45,848
- You're not done.
- I know what you're doing.

440
00:21:46,103 --> 00:21:47,934
It's your business. It's not mine.

441
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:51,062
I'm not taking his picture anymore.

442
00:22:00,669 --> 00:22:02,610
<i>Please record your message.</i>

443
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,634
Hi, Graham. This is Lucy Spiller.

444
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:07,578
I need you to get on Holt McLaren.
Send me everything you get.

445
00:22:07,933 --> 00:22:08,938
Thank you.

446
00:22:09,735 --> 00:22:11,736
Well, Lili Steiner came
through in a big way.

447
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:12,937
What, she got you a place?

448
00:22:13,057 --> 00:22:15,553
She was driving me up Stone Canyon
to show me this guesthouse,

449
00:22:15,673 --> 00:22:17,310
when she points at this

450
00:22:17,479 --> 00:22:20,977
hideous faux chateau, and she tells
me that Roy Toy's ex, Debbie Ann,

451
00:22:21,097 --> 00:22:22,694
is seriously considering it,

452
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:24,186
it for 4.2 million dollars.

453
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:26,543
She must be window-shopping.
She doesn't have that kind of money.

454
00:22:26,663 --> 00:22:29,258
No, she had a letter prequalifying
her from the bank.

455
00:22:29,378 --> 00:22:32,304
Look, Roy Toy hasn't seen
any other woman but his ex.

456
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:34,314
She's looking at houses
she can't afford.

457
00:22:34,434 --> 00:22:36,555
She's blasting Sharlee
and defending him.

458
00:22:36,675 --> 00:22:38,482
He's having an affair with Debbie Ann.

459
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:40,699
Why would he have an affair
with the same woman he left

460
00:22:40,819 --> 00:22:41,999
for Sharlee in the first place?

461
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:44,031
Why do men do any of the things they do?

462
00:22:44,151 --> 00:22:45,556
Do you think it's inconceivable

463
00:22:45,676 --> 00:22:47,936
that he might actually
be in love with her?

464
00:22:48,056 --> 00:22:50,159
Farber, you're living in a Reese
Witherspoon movie.

465
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:51,832
You know what?
I prefer a Jane Austen novel.

466
00:22:51,952 --> 00:22:53,791
Kids, prove he's having an affair.

467
00:22:53,991 --> 00:22:55,541
That is a great cover.

468
00:22:56,233 --> 00:22:58,045
And take Don with you. He's available.

469
00:22:59,315 --> 00:23:02,965
I can't believe Lili Steiner came
through you. It's so unfair.

470
00:23:10,808 --> 00:23:12,535
See, I don't think I can get it,

471
00:23:12,655 --> 00:23:15,019
'cause he's a total phone freak,

472
00:23:15,158 --> 00:23:16,765
and he never puts it down.

473
00:23:16,885 --> 00:23:18,893
Only need it for a couple of minutes.

474
00:23:19,013 --> 00:23:20,607
Now, do you want

475
00:23:21,091 --> 00:23:23,703
- chocolate or strawberry milk?
- Strawberry.

476
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:27,823
- Okay.
- Anything digital can be tracked.

477
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:30,228
Willa, a-at work,

478
00:23:30,485 --> 00:23:33,440
said you can hack into the card
and then pull it up on the computer.

479
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,083
The government does it all the time,
and they know all kind of stuff.

480
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,681
You know,

481
00:23:37,801 --> 00:23:40,151
I thought they knew stuff until 9/11.

482
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:42,154
They don't know shit about
what's going on.

483
00:23:42,274 --> 00:23:43,591
Boy, I know.

484
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:45,161
I was being watched.

485
00:23:46,234 --> 00:23:47,238
You were?

486
00:23:48,297 --> 00:23:49,097
No.

487
00:23:50,076 --> 00:23:51,226
I don't know.

488
00:23:51,593 --> 00:23:52,719
I'm schizophrenic.

489
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:54,852
I'm taking shots and...
and getting better.

490
00:23:55,879 --> 00:23:56,886
Yeah.

491
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,562
You know,

492
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:03,445
I know what it's like
to be watched all the time.

493
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:06,173
- It's pretty scary.
- Mm-hmm.

494
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:08,047
Whether it's real or not.

495
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:09,120
Yeah.

496
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:14,974
Do you think that Roy is gonna
find out what you're doing?

497
00:24:17,149 --> 00:24:18,542
I don't have to do it.

498
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,069
I wanna know.

499
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,271
Okay.

500
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:37,937
Have them send an arrangement to my
mother tomorrow. It's her birthday.

501
00:24:38,439 --> 00:24:41,389
Make sure there's lots of lilies.
She's allergic.

502
00:24:45,194 --> 00:24:45,994
Hi.

503
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:48,551
- I'm Genevieve.
- I know who you are.

504
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:51,809
Hi. Lucy Spiller.
I just am shocked to see you here.

505
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:55,508
We don't get visitors of your kind,
just the occasional process server.

506
00:24:55,628 --> 00:24:58,002
Yeah. We just wanted to
set the records straight

507
00:24:58,122 --> 00:24:59,922
- about us.
- What about you?

508
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:01,727
We had sex during our shoot.

509
00:25:01,847 --> 00:25:04,630
We couldn't help it. We're out
of our minds for each other.

510
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:06,177
Right?

511
00:25:10,069 --> 00:25:11,887
Um, how would you... Okay.

512
00:25:12,214 --> 00:25:13,597
How would you like to do
an interview right now?

513
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:16,812
- All you had to do is ask.
- Great. My office is

514
00:25:17,005 --> 00:25:18,920
- right in there.
- Let's go.

515
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,147
- Is that a plastic shirt?
- Yeah. And neoprene.

516
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:36,522
Here.

517
00:25:36,775 --> 00:25:38,455
Here it is. Please hurry.

518
00:25:38,813 --> 00:25:41,163
He's just reading Romy Pat the Bunny.

519
00:25:41,823 --> 00:25:42,776
It's so weird.

520
00:25:42,896 --> 00:25:46,446
He's just playing with her
and acting like everything's fine.

521
00:25:47,626 --> 00:25:48,703
I feel sick.

522
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,143
Here.

523
00:25:51,944 --> 00:25:53,587
Just is in case you get hungry.

524
00:25:53,707 --> 00:25:55,457
Oh, wonderful. Thank you.

525
00:25:57,814 --> 00:25:58,848
Okay.

526
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,666
Okay. Bye.

527
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:09,509
It's nice to remember why
you got into the business.

528
00:26:09,629 --> 00:26:13,379
Yeah. I wanted to prove that good
television wasn't an oxymoron.

529
00:26:13,912 --> 00:26:15,495
- Wanna know what I did today?
- What?

530
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,929
I had corporate marketing fusion
integration meetings

531
00:26:18,049 --> 00:26:19,472
with the parent company.

532
00:26:19,592 --> 00:26:21,335
Wow! No wonder you called so much.

533
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,920
Yeah, by the way,
thanks for taking my calls.

534
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,990
Oh, I'm sorry. I was swamped.

535
00:26:26,439 --> 00:26:28,576
Don't even try and pull
that off with me.

536
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:31,099
You wanna take a call, you take a call.

537
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:33,594
Look, you don't need to run away,
all right? There's no pressure here

538
00:26:33,871 --> 00:26:34,902
at all.

539
00:26:35,116 --> 00:26:37,681
I just, you know...
I like being with you.

540
00:26:39,942 --> 00:26:42,246
You, my friend, are a great salesman.

541
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:49,811
<i>You left your phone on the counter.</i>

542
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:52,898
Oh, my God. I'm a genius.

543
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:54,290
<i>Bye, baby.</i>

544
00:26:55,222 --> 00:26:56,200
<i>Daddy loves you.</i>

545
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,522
<i>- Bye.
- Whatever, yo.</i>

546
00:27:17,852 --> 00:27:21,291
Hey, do you wanna go to the
Hollywood Gold Awards with me?

547
00:27:21,411 --> 00:27:24,361
It'd actually be kind of fun
if I went with you.

548
00:27:27,332 --> 00:27:28,322
Hello.

549
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:32,487
Sure.

550
00:27:33,866 --> 00:27:35,516
Don't sound so excited.

551
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:37,071
What?

552
00:27:51,698 --> 00:27:55,448
<i>Brayden, if you don't get on the potty,
you're gonna peeps the bed!</i>

553
00:27:55,568 --> 00:27:57,307
One more thing about that goddamn potty,

554
00:27:57,427 --> 00:27:58,971
and I'm gonna shoot myself.

555
00:28:00,607 --> 00:28:01,611
<i>Brayden!</i>

556
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:05,019
<i>Roy, can you just go get him and
put him on the potty, please?</i>

557
00:28:05,523 --> 00:28:06,895
I'm serious. Give me a gun.

558
00:28:07,276 --> 00:28:08,310
<i>He doesn't have to go.</i>

559
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:12,380
<i>Well, put a Pull-Up on him if he
doesn't have to go to the bathroom.</i>

560
00:28:18,652 --> 00:28:21,504
I know he's a cheater,
but he seems like a good dad.

561
00:28:21,624 --> 00:28:23,565
I mean, most guys cheat anyway, right?

562
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:24,835
I don't know.

563
00:28:25,488 --> 00:28:27,639
Maybe you just choose guys who cheat.

564
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:28,861
No, I don't.

565
00:28:32,117 --> 00:28:33,121
Maybe I do.

566
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:47,467
Holy shit. They're having an affair.

567
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:49,605
Not nice.

568
00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:52,175
Unbelievable. I don't understand.

569
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:55,018
You don't have to understand.

570
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:57,696
Is that a tattoo on her ass?

571
00:29:00,045 --> 00:29:01,153
"Roy's Toy."

572
00:29:01,494 --> 00:29:02,813
Well, that seals it.

573
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:05,329
- We got it.
- No, no, no. Let's keep watching.

574
00:29:07,291 --> 00:29:09,024
That... Don, that's gross.

575
00:29:09,602 --> 00:29:11,835
- Do it on your own time.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

576
00:29:12,652 --> 00:29:15,255
Seriously, rent a video or something.
Let's go!

577
00:29:15,561 --> 00:29:16,736
It's my job.

578
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,391
No wonder I like bad boys.

579
00:29:26,382 --> 00:29:28,432
<i>Why can't we live together now?</i>

580
00:29:28,633 --> 00:29:29,963
<i>You already moved out.</i>

581
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:33,233
<i>Babe, if we live together now,
it's gonna look funky.</i>

582
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,027
<i>Nuh-uh. Then you should've stayed
married to her for another year,</i>

583
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,670
<i>'cause we could've gotten
another million out of her.</i>

584
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:41,858
Oh, my God!

585
00:29:42,324 --> 00:29:44,743
His whole marriage to Sharlee
was a complete scam.

586
00:29:44,925 --> 00:29:47,202
What an asshole! This is fantastic!

587
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,541
The truth always comes
out in the afterglow.

588
00:29:53,661 --> 00:29:56,377
You know, you're kind of s-spooky.
In a good way.

589
00:29:58,986 --> 00:30:00,236
And so are you.

590
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,640
You couldn't make this Roy Toy stuff up.
Nobody would believe it.

591
00:30:06,931 --> 00:30:09,331
Never underestimate the truly... greedy.

592
00:30:10,762 --> 00:30:12,067
Who is that?

593
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:13,742
Bond.

594
00:30:13,862 --> 00:30:14,935
James Bond.

595
00:30:15,394 --> 00:30:16,944
- Hi, Graham.
- Hey.

596
00:30:17,136 --> 00:30:19,672
Did a great job on the
Holt McLaren photos.

597
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:23,358
- You've really captured the moment.
- Thank you. I think it's brilliant.

598
00:30:23,478 --> 00:30:25,892
I mean, they really liked each other,
so it made it easier for me.

599
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:27,198
Great.

600
00:30:27,411 --> 00:30:28,961
Uh, sorry. Excuse me.

601
00:30:30,409 --> 00:30:31,303
Elaine.

602
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:33,765
Darling,

603
00:30:34,404 --> 00:30:35,454
how are you?

604
00:30:36,046 --> 00:30:38,096
Yeah, probably about 10 minutes.

605
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:40,162
All right. I'll see you there.

606
00:30:40,282 --> 00:30:43,010
Elaine Bass? You have another
assignment with Icon?

607
00:30:43,272 --> 00:30:45,679
No, no. Just a quick coffee.

608
00:30:45,932 --> 00:30:47,927
Right. All right.
Well, I'll call you later.

609
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,397
I look forward to that. Okay.
Cheers.

610
00:30:55,245 --> 00:30:56,895
I don't wanna tell you.

611
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,907
You have to.

612
00:31:01,701 --> 00:31:02,851
It's not good.

613
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:05,435
It's not good.

614
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:08,816
Play with my hair, Don.

615
00:31:17,174 --> 00:31:18,524
I-It's Debbie Ann.

616
00:31:19,212 --> 00:31:22,862
They never really broke up.
They planned it to get your money.

617
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,202
What do you mean?

618
00:31:30,145 --> 00:31:31,189
They, uh...

619
00:31:32,091 --> 00:31:33,095
They...

620
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:36,706
You know, he...

621
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:38,639
he married you, but...

622
00:31:39,072 --> 00:31:40,822
he never really left her.

623
00:31:43,805 --> 00:31:45,113
But we had Romy.

624
00:31:51,987 --> 00:31:52,990
Oh, he...

625
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:56,355
he loved me.

626
00:31:58,777 --> 00:31:59,781
We were...

627
00:32:00,683 --> 00:32:01,972
We were in love.

628
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:04,625
You...

629
00:32:04,997 --> 00:32:06,004
You were.

630
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,061
I'm sorry.

631
00:32:12,898 --> 00:32:13,912
I saw them.

632
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:19,049
These are pictures.

633
00:32:19,425 --> 00:32:20,575
They're yours.

634
00:32:20,956 --> 00:32:23,306
Give them to your lawyer or whatever.

635
00:32:25,116 --> 00:32:26,666
You're a good friend.

636
00:32:27,387 --> 00:32:29,237
You're a really good friend.

637
00:32:32,434 --> 00:32:33,458
Thank you.

638
00:32:34,157 --> 00:32:35,203
Are you okay?

639
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:37,015
Thank you so much.

640
00:32:40,471 --> 00:32:41,971
Thank you, Don.

641
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,360
Sharlee, I'm worried about you.

642
00:32:45,691 --> 00:32:46,907
Thank you, Don.

643
00:32:49,846 --> 00:32:50,850
Thank you.

644
00:32:56,026 --> 00:32:57,776
Here. You keep some, Don.

645
00:32:58,181 --> 00:33:01,031
Sell it on the Internet if
you need some money.

646
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:14,924
What did I do?

647
00:33:19,251 --> 00:33:20,589
I'm fixing it.

648
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,262
I don't want it! Help me!

649
00:33:26,883 --> 00:33:29,069
Help me get it out!

650
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:52,537
Hey, Don!

651
00:33:56,698 --> 00:33:57,706
It's me!

652
00:33:58,800 --> 00:33:59,804
Coming!

653
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:08,993
Jason, you came!

654
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,949
Well, let me... let me help.
Let me get that.

655
00:34:14,124 --> 00:34:15,127
Thanks.

656
00:34:26,485 --> 00:34:27,691
Look at you.

657
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,290
- I need you, Donnie.
- I'm here.

658
00:34:34,725 --> 00:34:35,728
I'm here.

659
00:34:40,472 --> 00:34:41,822
I like your place.

660
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:44,679
I'm gonna get, uh, some blinds.

661
00:34:44,799 --> 00:34:46,696
The kind they deliver and fix and...

662
00:34:46,816 --> 00:34:48,422
You know, in three days.

663
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:53,274
Sorry about the smell.
I dropped some chemicals.

664
00:34:53,394 --> 00:34:55,594
Oh, it's okay.
I'm taking a shitload of them.

665
00:34:55,714 --> 00:34:58,152
- Yeah? Yeah, me, too.
- Oh, you look good.

666
00:34:59,217 --> 00:35:00,467
You lost weight.

667
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:02,361
There's some, um... some

668
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:05,131
cheese and some salami
in the refrigerator.

669
00:35:09,262 --> 00:35:10,812
Hey, where you going?

670
00:35:11,284 --> 00:35:13,759
I... I gotta deliver some photographs

671
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,548
- to Lucy.
- I just got here.

672
00:35:15,668 --> 00:35:17,234
I'm sorry. You know,

673
00:35:17,622 --> 00:35:19,886
the bathroom's just right
around the bend right here,

674
00:35:20,006 --> 00:35:21,556
and here's the couch.

675
00:35:21,826 --> 00:35:23,854
And, uh, this... this

676
00:35:24,215 --> 00:35:25,509
is Tristan II.

677
00:35:26,016 --> 00:35:27,666
He'll keep you company.

678
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:33,396
All right. Well, we'll
catch up when you get back.

679
00:35:33,516 --> 00:35:36,366
When I get back, we'll
catch up. It'll be good.

680
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,330
It's great. I can't believe it.

681
00:35:48,170 --> 00:35:49,520
Congratulations...

682
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:51,851
on breaking the Roy story.

683
00:35:52,069 --> 00:35:53,619
So glad I could help.

684
00:35:53,747 --> 00:35:56,517
And I'm so glad that I could
steer you in the right direction

685
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:58,287
with Zach and Genevieve.

686
00:35:58,511 --> 00:35:59,761
How about that?

687
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:02,925
They really do love each other.

688
00:36:03,317 --> 00:36:04,879
Yes, you're all right.

689
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:07,863
You're an unadulterated romantic.

690
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:10,253
"Unadulterated"?
That's a lot of syllables.

691
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,190
Don't hurt yourself.

692
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:14,066
Listen, because of me, you

693
00:36:14,186 --> 00:36:16,750
found a great place to live.
You should be kissing

694
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:17,874
my ass.

695
00:36:19,414 --> 00:36:21,264
Can I start with your lips?

696
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:23,782
Farber,

697
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:26,819
- was that a first move?
- Yeah, it was.

698
00:36:46,571 --> 00:36:49,419
Ooh, ooh, ooh, no. No, not in there.
Skeletons.

699
00:36:57,838 --> 00:36:59,377
Hey, where you been?

700
00:36:59,766 --> 00:37:00,774
Here.

701
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,559
Oh, sweet Lord.

702
00:37:11,886 --> 00:37:13,548
Don, these are phenomenal.

703
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:18,455
- No one else has these?
- No. There was just me and her.

704
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:22,279
You are a god.

705
00:37:24,301 --> 00:37:26,037
This cover is gonna kill.

706
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,444
I hate it.

707
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:30,697
Lucy,

708
00:37:31,578 --> 00:37:33,046
why can't we help her?

709
00:37:33,174 --> 00:37:34,792
Because we're not her

710
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:37,335
doctor, her family or her friends.

711
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:40,845
Oh. Oh, I can only be her friend when
you want me to be? That's not right.

712
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,559
Don,

713
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:45,464
celebrities sign up to be
a part of this circus.

714
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:48,506
When a clown puts
on a big red rubber nose,

715
00:37:48,626 --> 00:37:50,711
he's expecting
people to point and laugh.

716
00:37:51,784 --> 00:37:54,734
God knows what they'd do
if we stopped watching.

717
00:37:55,666 --> 00:37:58,251
- It's not right, though.
- Oh, it's not right? Don, what

718
00:37:58,371 --> 00:38:02,921
you're getting healthier, so now you're
developing a conscience? That's perfect.

719
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,533
Oh, you can't control me,
and you don't like that, do you?

720
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,411
Loving people is not
about controlling them!

721
00:38:14,049 --> 00:38:16,164
Okay? That's not what it's about!

722
00:38:51,406 --> 00:38:52,856
What are you doing?

723
00:38:54,305 --> 00:38:55,838
I'm glad you're here.

724
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,630
I probably shouldn't be.

725
00:39:15,455 --> 00:39:16,905
What is this thing?

726
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:20,034
I don't know. I just wanna be with you.

727
00:39:20,857 --> 00:39:21,696
Me, too.

728
00:39:28,023 --> 00:39:30,673
You know, maybe we
should just start over.

729
00:39:32,028 --> 00:39:34,207
You know, 'cause I wanna
get it right this time.

730
00:39:35,817 --> 00:39:37,293
We got some of it right.

731
00:39:42,394 --> 00:39:45,544
Lucy Spiller, would you like
to go on a date with me?

732
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,965
Yes, I would.

733
00:39:48,668 --> 00:39:50,118
How about the, um...

734
00:39:51,805 --> 00:39:53,555
the Hollywood Gold Awards?

735
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,450
We can't do that.

736
00:39:55,823 --> 00:39:58,273
Besides, I'm already going with someone.

737
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:03,716
So we're still seeing other people, huh?

738
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,650
But I'll be thinking about you.

739
00:40:07,843 --> 00:40:09,784
Can this count as our first date?

740
00:40:10,587 --> 00:40:13,329
No. I think we just started over.

741
00:40:13,759 --> 00:40:15,666
So I wouldn't invite you in or anything?

742
00:40:16,312 --> 00:40:18,198
- No,...
- That would be

743
00:40:18,755 --> 00:40:22,295
- too soon. It might scare me off.
- I wouldn't wanna do that.

744
00:40:22,415 --> 00:40:23,418
No.

745
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,741
I'd love to kiss you good night, though.

746
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:35,565
Me, too.

747
00:41:20,432 --> 00:41:23,245
