1
00:00:00,386 --> 00:00:01,553
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,954
For over a century, I
have lived in secret,

3
00:00:04,022 --> 00:00:07,658
until now. I know the risk,
and I have to know her.

4
00:00:07,726 --> 00:00:08,993
Elena, she's a dead ringer for Katherine.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,162
- Where is he?
- They have him. I can't get in.

6
00:00:11,229 --> 00:00:13,297
Who says we're not
here for revenge, right?

7
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:15,132
That's exactly what we're here for.

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,434
Can you make it?

9
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:17,902
Unh! Uhh!

10
00:00:18,003 --> 00:00:19,770
Take my wrist. You need more blood.

11
00:00:21,406 --> 00:00:23,808
Stefan, he's dead.

12
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:27,511
You were like this other person.

13
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:29,580
Everything's gonna be ok.

14
00:00:31,082 --> 00:00:32,149
They found Vicki Donovan.

15
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,084
A storm unearthed the
grave off county road.

16
00:00:34,152 --> 00:00:36,153
- She's dead?
- Matt.

17
00:00:50,235 --> 00:00:52,736
Could you turn it up a little bit?

18
00:00:52,804 --> 00:00:54,138
It's not annoying yet.

19
00:00:54,206 --> 00:00:55,473
Sorry.

20
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:01,011
When you goin' back to school?

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,379
Soon.

22
00:01:02,447 --> 00:01:05,649
Oh, come on. Just drink already.

23
00:01:05,717 --> 00:01:07,718
Come on.

24
00:01:07,786 --> 00:01:09,787
This self-detox is unnatural.

25
00:01:09,855 --> 00:01:12,022
Could you get that away from me, please?

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,693
How long did it take you to wean yourself
off of it after you last indulged?

27
00:01:17,162 --> 00:01:18,295
That's not good.

28
00:01:18,363 --> 00:01:20,130
I'll be fine. It just
takes a little bit of time.

29
00:01:20,198 --> 00:01:21,298
I don't get it. You know,

30
00:01:21,366 --> 00:01:22,766
you don't have to kill to survive.

31
00:01:22,834 --> 00:01:24,034
That's what blood banks are for.

32
00:01:24,102 --> 00:01:25,769
I haven't hunted a human in...

33
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:27,271
gahh... way too long.

34
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:28,606
Oh, I'm impressed.

35
00:01:28,673 --> 00:01:30,875
It was completely self-serving.

36
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,944
Trying to get the town
off the trail of vampires,

37
00:01:34,012 --> 00:01:35,312
which is not very easy,

38
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,249
considering there's an entire
tomb of them running around.

39
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:39,517
What are we planning on doing about that?

40
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,452
We're not gonna be doing much of anything

41
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,020
if you don't have your strength.

42
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:44,788
There's nothing wrong with partaking

43
00:01:44,856 --> 00:01:47,825
in a healthy diet of human
blood from a blood bank.

44
00:01:47,893 --> 00:01:49,326
You're not actually killing anyone.

45
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:50,661
I have my reasons.

46
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:52,630
Well, what are those
holier-than-thou reasons?

47
00:01:52,697 --> 00:01:54,798
You know, we've never
actually discussed that.

48
00:01:54,866 --> 00:01:57,401
You know, I... I'd
love to hear this story.

49
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:59,537
You're really enjoying this, aren't you,

50
00:01:59,604 --> 00:02:02,072
just watching me in a struggle?

51
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,073
Very much so.

52
00:02:03,141 --> 00:02:05,042
I hate to break it to you, Damon,

53
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:09,480
but... ahem... I actually
have it under complete control.

54
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:11,415
You do?

55
00:02:11,483 --> 00:02:15,152
Oh. Well, then you should just carry on

56
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,055
making the rest of us vampires look bad.

57
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,592
Have a great day, Stef.

58
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:35,039
Oh. Hey, I almost forgot something.

59
00:02:35,106 --> 00:02:36,407
Oops.

60
00:02:39,311 --> 00:02:41,912
Mmm. Mmm.

61
00:02:41,913 --> 00:02:42,913

62
00:02:47,986 --> 00:02:50,721
Come on, Jeremy. Going to school.

63
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,289
Walking out the door now.

64
00:02:52,357 --> 00:02:53,323
You forgot this.

65
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:55,859
Thank you.

66
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:57,728
Elena.

67
00:02:57,796 --> 00:02:59,563
Uncle John. Hi.

68
00:02:59,631 --> 00:03:01,465
Jenna.

69
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:02,666
John. You made it.

70
00:03:02,734 --> 00:03:04,101
Said I'd be in by noon.

71
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:05,569
Oh, what you say and what you do

72
00:03:05,637 --> 00:03:07,171
are typically very different things.

73
00:03:07,238 --> 00:03:08,806
Uncle John. What's up?

74
00:03:08,873 --> 00:03:10,340
Hey.

75
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:13,076
I had some business in town.

76
00:03:13,144 --> 00:03:15,012
I thought a visit was in order.

77
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:16,914
- How long you staying?
- I don't know yet.

78
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:19,650
Hmm. Ok. Well, I'm gonna go
to school. I'll see you later.

79
00:03:23,421 --> 00:03:26,123
What's up with Jeremy?

80
00:03:26,191 --> 00:03:28,058
He just lost a friend,

81
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,660
so try to be sensitive.

82
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:31,929
I'm always sensitive.

83
00:03:31,996 --> 00:03:35,132
Right. So really, how lo are you staying?

84
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,534
Can't you at least pretend
that you're happy to see me?

85
00:03:37,602 --> 00:03:38,569
Oh, my God, John.

86
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,304
It is so good to see you.

87
00:03:40,371 --> 00:03:41,538
How have you been?

88
00:03:41,606 --> 00:03:43,607
No, I can't.

89
00:03:43,675 --> 00:03:45,409
Did you really think I was just gonna sign

90
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,944
the escrow papers and send 'em back?

91
00:03:47,011 --> 00:03:48,078
Actually, I did.

92
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:50,113
I'm not gonna let you
sell my brother's office.

93
00:03:50,181 --> 00:03:51,748
It's not up you or me.

94
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:53,150
It belongs to Jeremy and Elena.

95
00:03:53,218 --> 00:03:55,719
But they're minors,
so I get the final say,

96
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:57,888
being that I'm the estate's trustee.

97
00:03:58,857 --> 00:04:01,058
He said his trip is open-ended.

98
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,126
Uncle John. I never really liked that guy.

99
00:04:03,194 --> 00:04:04,995
Heh. Does anyone?

100
00:04:05,063 --> 00:04:07,197
I am here for moral
support if you need me.

101
00:04:07,265 --> 00:04:09,867
Thanks. I think I'll
suffer this one alone.

102
00:04:09,934 --> 00:04:11,501
You've been through enough.

103
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:14,071
Thank you, by e way,

104
00:04:14,138 --> 00:04:15,973
for just... for everything you did

105
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:18,141
at Vicki's funeral and her memorial.

106
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:19,376
I couldn't have done it without you.

107
00:04:19,444 --> 00:04:21,511
Of course, Matt.

108
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:27,384
So is Caroline still baking
for you guys around the clock?

109
00:04:27,452 --> 00:04:29,486
She finally went to her dad's,

110
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:33,390
which is a good thing, because
my mom was gonna strangle her

111
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,559
if she dropped off more lasagna.

112
00:04:35,627 --> 00:04:36,593
Oh.

113
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,970
Nah.

114
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:48,472
What's your problem?

115
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,707
I just don't want any.

116
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:53,143
All right.

117
00:04:55,413 --> 00:04:57,814
They say she oded.

118
00:04:57,882 --> 00:05:01,118
That's what I don't get. She was doin' ok.

119
00:05:02,287 --> 00:05:03,453
Apparently not.

120
00:05:05,056 --> 00:05:06,657
How'd she end up buried in the woods?

121
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:07,858
That's what I don't understand.

122
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:10,060
By whoever was with her when she oded.

123
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:11,028
Yeah, but you leave her there.

124
00:05:11,095 --> 00:05:12,462
You don't take the time to bury her.

125
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:14,898
Maybe she saw something and...

126
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:20,270
Hell, man, I don't know.

127
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:32,015
The coroner's office has officially ruled

128
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:34,718
Vicki Donovan's death drug overdose.

129
00:05:34,786 --> 00:05:36,753
Her family has been notified.

130
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,288
The truth will stay in this room,

131
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:41,324
and we can put this behind us.

132
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:43,260
Thank you, sheriff.

133
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,430
And on to a more pressing issue.

134
00:05:46,497 --> 00:05:48,532
John Gilbert has ask to say a few words.

135
00:05:48,599 --> 00:05:50,967
Welcome back, John. It's good to see you.

136
00:05:51,035 --> 00:05:52,135
- Thank you, mayor.
- Yeah.

137
00:05:52,203 --> 00:05:54,171
Hello, everyone. It's
wonderful to see you.

138
00:05:54,238 --> 00:05:56,106
I wish it were under better circumstances

139
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:57,474
as a founding family member,

140
00:05:57,542 --> 00:06:00,077
I find it's my duty to report
some very distressing news.

141
00:06:00,144 --> 00:06:01,078
He's a Gilbert?

142
00:06:01,145 --> 00:06:02,145
Elena's uncle.

143
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:04,948
His name's John, but I call him jackass.

144
00:06:05,016 --> 00:06:07,150
A hospital blood bank in the
neighboring county of Amherst

145
00:06:07,218 --> 00:06:09,119
has reported several break-ins
over the past 2 weeks.

146
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:11,888
7 hunters, 4 campers,
and 2 state employees

147
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,890
have been reported missing as well,

148
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,626
all of this within a 75-mile
radius of mystic falls.

149
00:06:16,694 --> 00:06:20,430
O... ok. No need to get
alarmed right at this Mont.

150
00:06:20,498 --> 00:06:22,732
Meaning he doesn't wanna cancel
the founder's day kick-off party.

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,669
You think all of your problems are over,

152
00:06:25,736 --> 00:06:29,906
but I'm here to tell you
nothing's been solved.

153
00:06:29,974 --> 00:06:34,010
I made a copy of a paper
that Jeremy wrote for me.

154
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,247
I think you should take a look it.

155
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:42,986
Jeremy wrote this?

156
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:46,423
He's very clear that he
didn't think it was real.

157
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:48,058
I really hope you're right,

158
00:06:48,126 --> 00:06:51,962
because I've done so much
to protect him from all this.

159
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:57,501
So how do you deal with it?

160
00:06:57,568 --> 00:06:59,336
What do you mean?

161
00:06:59,403 --> 00:07:01,838
I don't know. With all
the lies and the secrets.

162
00:07:01,906 --> 00:07:05,775
You have to lie to everyone
who's important to you.

163
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:08,712
It's not safe for them to know the truth,

164
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,881
so, yes, I keep it from them,

165
00:07:10,948 --> 00:07:13,383
but it's only because I love them.

166
00:07:15,453 --> 00:07:18,822
I think Stefan's a good guy,

167
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:21,191
but, uh...

168
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:24,461
At the end of the day,
he's still a vampire.

169
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:26,496
I know it's hard to understand,

170
00:07:26,564 --> 00:07:28,298
but Stefan's different.

171
00:07:30,101 --> 00:07:32,936
He would never do anything to hurt me.

172
00:07:33,004 --> 00:07:36,006
I have no interest in the
founder's day kick-off party.

173
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:37,641
Sure, you do. It's tradition.

174
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,776
Far be it for us to break from tradition.

175
00:07:39,844 --> 00:07:43,280
The Gilberts have been a part
of this town for 150 years,

176
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:45,448
one of the founding families,

177
00:07:45,516 --> 00:07:48,952
and with that distinction
comes certain obligations,

178
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:51,021
including going to the party.

179
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:54,457
One DA when you can
appreciate the significance,

180
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:57,027
I'll tell you all about your heritage.

181
00:07:57,094 --> 00:07:59,629
Hmm. The Gilbert family legacy.

182
00:07:59,697 --> 00:08:01,164
I forgot how sacred it was.

183
00:08:01,232 --> 00:08:03,600
I'm not a Gilbert, so I was
never cool enough to hear it.

184
00:08:04,936 --> 00:08:07,070
Why does she hate you?

185
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:08,572
We used to sleep together.

186
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,275
I'm standing right here.

187
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,246
Why would he write a report on vampires?

188
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:18,682
Do you think he's starting to remember?

189
00:08:18,749 --> 00:08:20,450
Damon took away those memories for good.

190
00:08:20,518 --> 00:08:22,586
You don't have to worry about that.

191
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:26,189
Tell you what. Why don't you just ask him?

192
00:08:27,158 --> 00:08:28,225
I... I can't.

193
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,794
Why not? I mean, if he
doesn't know anything,

194
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:34,164
then it's just a-an innocent question.

195
00:08:34,232 --> 00:08:37,300
I don't even know how
to talk to him anymore.

196
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:41,838
I mean, we used to be a lot
more open with each other,

197
00:08:41,906 --> 00:08:45,308
but now, with all these
secrets just piling up...

198
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:49,045
You know, I haven't even
told him that I'm adopted yet.

199
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:53,416
Maybe it's time you start
opening up to him again.

200
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,586
I'm not saying you should
tell him everything,

201
00:08:56,654 --> 00:09:00,924
but at least try to find out what
he does know and be prepared for it.

202
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,160
What about you? How are you doing?

203
00:09:04,228 --> 00:09:06,363
I'm much, much better.

204
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:09,599
Yeah, I'm... I'm still,
you know, a little, uh...

205
00:09:09,667 --> 00:09:13,270
a little jittery, a little
bit on edge, but, uh...

206
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:14,904
I'm... I'm gonna be ok.

207
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:19,309
I've been really worried
about you, and I missed you.

208
00:09:19,377 --> 00:09:22,612
I just needed to lay
low for a little while,

209
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,481
and, uh, let my body readjust.

210
00:09:24,548 --> 00:09:26,750
It's only been a few days.

211
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,652
It feels like a lifetime.

212
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,658
I've missed you, too.

213
00:10:11,495 --> 00:10:13,296
Stefan, what's wrong?

214
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:17,200
Stefan.

215
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,198
Oh, good. You're here.

216
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:37,466
You ask, I come.

217
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:39,101
I'm easy like that.

218
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,506
No, Elena, I will not...

219
00:10:44,574 --> 00:10:46,074
Go to your bedroom with you.

220
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:50,913
Ah...

221
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,347
Just like I remembered.

222
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:54,016
Stop messing around.

223
00:10:59,354 --> 00:11:03,525
You know, did you know that your uncle's
been kickin' it with the founder's council?

224
00:11:03,592 --> 00:11:05,226
- What?
- Yep.

225
00:11:05,294 --> 00:11:07,395
Perfect. We'll just add
it to the growing list

226
00:11:07,463 --> 00:11:09,831
of how everything's falling apart.

227
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,699
What happened right there?

228
00:11:12,902 --> 00:11:15,403
Uh, nothing.

229
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:20,308
Look, Damon, I... I'm
worried about Stefan.

230
00:11:20,409 --> 00:11:21,910
He says that everything's ok,

231
00:11:21,977 --> 00:11:23,278
but he's clearly struggling.

232
00:11:23,345 --> 00:11:25,380
How long iit gonna take
before he's back to normal?

233
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:26,748
Few days, give or take.

234
00:11:26,816 --> 00:11:27,982
It's been a few days.

235
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,717
Give then. I don't know.

236
00:11:29,785 --> 00:11:30,885
What's the big deal?

237
00:11:30,953 --> 00:11:33,154
He's not himself, Damon.

238
00:11:33,222 --> 00:11:38,226
Well, maybe his problem is is he's
spent too long not being himself.

239
00:11:42,031 --> 00:11:44,432
Please don't make me sorry for asking you.

240
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,633
It is what it is, Elena.

241
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:46,634
Hey.

242
00:11:46,702 --> 00:11:50,805
The Stefan you know was "good
behavior" Stefan, "reign it in" Stefan,

243
00:11:50,873 --> 00:11:54,642
"fight against his nature to an
annoyingly obsessive level" Stefan,

244
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,779
but if you think there's
not another part to this,

245
00:11:57,847 --> 00:12:00,181
then you have not been paying
attention. Tsk, tsk, tsk.

246
00:12:00,249 --> 00:12:01,916
He's not you, not even close.

247
00:12:01,984 --> 00:12:03,952
Well, he doesn't wanna be me.

248
00:12:05,321 --> 00:12:08,623
But that doesn't mean
deep down that he's t.

249
00:12:10,459 --> 00:12:11,926
Mm-hmm.

250
00:12:50,366 --> 00:12:51,432
Hey.

251
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,901
What's up?

252
00:12:52,968 --> 00:12:54,836
Do you have some time to talk?

253
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:58,540
Uh, yeah, sure.

254
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,641
Not here.

255
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:02,110
Come on. Let's get out of the house.

256
00:13:05,281 --> 00:13:09,150
I just can't believe mom and dad
never told you that you were adopted.

257
00:13:09,218 --> 00:13:10,919
I'm sure they would have eventually.

258
00:13:10,986 --> 00:13:13,521
Why were y worried about what I thought?

259
00:13:13,589 --> 00:13:16,758
Because... I don't know. It's weird...

260
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:21,362
Going your whole life thinking
you're related blood to someone.

261
00:13:22,331 --> 00:13:24,666
Does it bug you that we're not?

262
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:25,800
No. Jer...

263
00:13:25,868 --> 00:13:27,902
You're my brother.
That's all that matters.

264
00:13:29,972 --> 00:13:34,442
So Mr. Saltzman said you've
been doing great in history now.

265
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,978
Yeah. Yeah, he's really
been helpin' me out.

266
00:13:37,046 --> 00:13:39,380
He gave me some extra credit and stuff.

267
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:42,016
He loved your vampire paper.

268
00:13:42,084 --> 00:13:44,285
Yeah, he thought I had a clever angle.

269
00:13:44,353 --> 00:13:46,888
What drew you to that subject matter?

270
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:49,691
Uh, I don't know. Um, boredom.

271
00:13:49,758 --> 00:13:53,928
Or maybe I'm just as nuts as
the long line of Gilbert crazies.

272
00:13:53,996 --> 00:13:55,496
The Gilberts aren't crazy.

273
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:58,299
Ah, easy for you to say. You're not one.

274
00:13:58,367 --> 00:13:59,867
Ouch.

275
00:14:13,782 --> 00:14:15,717
Oh, God.

276
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,051
I shouldn't be here.

277
00:14:17,119 --> 00:14:18,586
Come on. Don't be a downer.

278
00:14:18,654 --> 00:14:20,588
It's a party for the founding families.

279
00:14:20,656 --> 00:14:23,424
That would be us. It
would be rude to skip it.

280
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:27,095
You know, I... I really liked you a
whole lot better when you hated everybody.

281
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:28,429
Oh, I still do.

282
00:14:28,497 --> 00:14:32,000
I just love that they love me.

283
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:35,036
How you feelin'?

284
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:36,304
I'm good. I'm fine.

285
00:14:36,372 --> 00:14:38,172
No cravings? No urges?

286
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,009
Has that whiskey you been
drinkin' all day doin' its job?

287
00:14:41,076 --> 00:14:42,010
Ah heh.

288
00:14:42,077 --> 00:14:44,679
We are who we are, Stan.

289
00:14:44,747 --> 00:14:46,047
Pretending doesn't change that.

290
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:47,849
Ah, nothing would make you happier

291
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:50,451
than to just see me give in, huh, Damon?

292
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,552
Whatever. It's inevitable.

293
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,487
Hmm.

294
00:14:52,554 --> 00:14:54,455
M gonna go find Elena.

295
00:14:54,523 --> 00:14:56,791
Don't embarrass me, young man.

296
00:15:06,268 --> 00:15:07,535
Ahh.

297
00:15:07,603 --> 00:15:10,805
I'm so glad you could join us tonight.

298
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:12,707
It was nice of you to reach out to us.

299
00:15:12,775 --> 00:15:15,109
This town is e big family,

300
00:15:15,177 --> 00:15:17,111
and when we lose a member,

301
00:15:17,179 --> 00:15:18,613
we all have to come together.

302
00:15:19,648 --> 00:15:21,983
Matt. Kel.

303
00:15:27,189 --> 00:15:28,556
Well, I guess dead kid

304
00:15:28,624 --> 00:15:30,892
rates a special greeting
from the mayor, huh?

305
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,894
Go mom.

306
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:34,462
I need a drink.

307
00:15:36,965 --> 00:15:38,833
Hey, check it out.

308
00:15:38,934 --> 00:15:42,236
Dude, your dad's gonna beat
you down if he catches you.

309
00:15:42,304 --> 00:15:43,571
Yeah, let him try.

310
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:45,173
All right, screw it.

311
00:15:53,782 --> 00:15:54,916
Hey.

312
00:15:54,983 --> 00:15:57,652
Hey. How are you?

313
00:15:58,921 --> 00:15:59,787
Are you drunk?

314
00:15:59,855 --> 00:16:02,090
Um...

315
00:16:03,359 --> 00:16:05,660
Ok, I know it's a little weird,

316
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:07,562
but it's really helping me.

317
00:16:07,629 --> 00:16:09,163
The alcohol, it, uh...

318
00:16:09,231 --> 00:16:10,765
Takes the edge off.

319
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,533
You're totally that drunk high school guy

320
00:16:12,601 --> 00:16:13,768
at the party sneaking booze.

321
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,503
I totally am. Yeah.

322
00:16:15,571 --> 00:16:16,571
How worried do I need to be?

323
00:16:16,638 --> 00:16:19,207
Oh, no. You don't need to be worried.

324
00:16:19,274 --> 00:16:22,577
It's just until, um, the cravings go away.

325
00:16:22,644 --> 00:16:26,381
Listen. How about we
enjoy it while it lasts?

326
00:16:27,883 --> 00:16:31,519
Would you like to dance
with me you hate dancing.

327
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:32,787
I usually have to beg you.

328
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:35,356
No, no, no. You have to beg the sober me.

329
00:16:35,424 --> 00:16:37,392
The drunk me, there's
no begging necessary.

330
00:16:37,459 --> 00:16:39,794
There's really no one dancing.

331
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:42,630
That's because they need
something better to dance to.

332
00:16:42,698 --> 00:16:44,832
Be right back.

333
00:16:47,236 --> 00:16:49,370
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

334
00:16:49,438 --> 00:16:52,106
I already tried to bribe the
guy with 20 bucks and a date.

335
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:56,177
He said Carol Lockwood has complete
control over the music choices.

336
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:00,381
You'd be surprised what
Stefan can accomplish

337
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:02,150
when he puts his mind to it.

338
00:17:05,187 --> 00:17:06,454
Thank God.

339
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:17,932
Have I entered an alternate
universe where Stefan is fun?

340
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,035
Is he gonna be ok?

341
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:22,303
Eventually.

342
00:17:23,172 --> 00:17:25,239
One way or another.

343
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:39,240
History teacher, 3 o'clock.

344
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,143
How do I look? Beautiful.

345
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:44,045
Ah, I been lookin' for you.

346
00:17:44,112 --> 00:17:45,613
Here I am.

347
00:17:46,515 --> 00:17:48,249
I haven't seen you in a while.

348
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,785
Yeah. Well, uh,

349
00:17:50,853 --> 00:17:52,553
things have been a little crazy. Heh.

350
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:53,921
But I'm here now.

351
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,289
Do you wanna get a drink?

352
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,924
Sure.

353
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:58,659
Ok. Great.

354
00:18:00,462 --> 00:18:01,929
When did this happen?

355
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:04,799
Deejay had a change of heart.

356
00:18:04,867 --> 00:18:06,834
Wanna dance? I don't know.

357
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:09,237
- Yes. Yes.
- Matt. Matt.

358
00:18:09,304 --> 00:18:10,938
Come on.

359
00:18:14,543 --> 00:18:16,944
Ah, you know I love a woman in uniform,

360
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,913
but I have to side with this look.

361
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,414
You look... you look smashing.

362
00:18:20,482 --> 00:18:24,051
Heh. Thank you, Damon.

363
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,119
Cheers.

364
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,754
I needed that.

365
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:28,389
Heh.

366
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:32,593
You know, I had my
doubts about you at first.

367
00:18:32,661 --> 00:18:34,829
But like everyone else on the council,

368
00:18:34,897 --> 00:18:36,530
you've won me over.

369
00:18:36,598 --> 00:18:38,900
Heh. Thanks, Liz.

370
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:42,570
It's... it's really nice how
welcoming the council's been.

371
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:45,239
I like my life he in mystic falls.

372
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:47,441
Starting to feel like home again.

373
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:50,044
Well, then you're not gonna
like what I have to tell you.

374
00:18:50,112 --> 00:18:52,480
Jonathan Gilbert's claims check out.

375
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:54,949
The blood banks, the missing
people, all of it's true.

376
00:18:56,018 --> 00:18:57,118
We might have a problem.

377
00:18:57,185 --> 00:18:59,020
Excuse me, sheriff.

378
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:01,422
Um, I was curious if there's been

379
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,392
any more information on what
happened to Vicki Donovan.

380
00:19:04,459 --> 00:19:06,294
It was an overdose, Jeremy.

381
00:19:06,361 --> 00:19:08,329
Yeah, but her body was buried.

382
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,630
Somebody must have done that.

383
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:11,999
We're aware of that.

384
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,567
The investigation is ongoing,

385
00:19:13,635 --> 00:19:16,671
but there's nothing more I
can tell you at this time.

386
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,206
I'm sorry.

387
00:19:19,274 --> 00:19:22,376
Uh, that's ok.

388
00:19:30,852 --> 00:19:33,888
Please dance with your
alcoholic vampire boyfriend.

389
00:19:37,859 --> 00:19:39,727
Ohh! Oh.

390
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:40,594
Watch it.

391
00:19:40,662 --> 00:19:43,164
I'm sorry. My fault. I'm clumsy.

392
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:45,700
Heh. Then get off the dance floor.

393
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,201
Excuse me?

394
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,970
That's no way to talk to a lady.

395
00:19:49,037 --> 00:19:50,204
Whatever.

396
00:19:53,241 --> 00:19:56,210
I think you need to apologize.

397
00:19:58,747 --> 00:19:59,914
Sorry.

398
00:20:06,722 --> 00:20:08,556
Now say it like you mean it.

399
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,393
I'm ally, really sorry.

400
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,794
Stefan, it's fine.

401
00:20:13,862 --> 00:20:15,830
Now walk away.

402
00:20:19,234 --> 00:20:20,735
Are you all right?

403
00:20:27,342 --> 00:20:30,378
Have you noticed what
your brother's been up to?

404
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:32,613
Nope. Been too preoccupied with yours.

405
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:34,749
Jeremy's been asking questions

406
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,717
about Vicki Donovan's death.

407
00:20:36,785 --> 00:20:38,719
He knows that her death
was ruled an overdose.

408
00:20:38,787 --> 00:20:40,988
Really? "Oh, but, Sheriff,
someone buried her.

409
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:42,256
Who would do that?"

410
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:44,325
I know. I know. Me.

411
00:20:44,393 --> 00:20:45,826
I mean, I could compel him,
but he's wearing vervain.

412
00:20:45,894 --> 00:20:48,262
No. I don't want you to compel him.

413
00:20:48,363 --> 00:20:50,164
If he keeps asking questions...

414
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:51,532
Damon, no. I'm serious.

415
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,235
I'm not gonna do that to
him again. I'll handle it.

416
00:20:54,302 --> 00:20:56,270
Ok.

417
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,939
Don't say I didn't warn you.

418
00:21:13,488 --> 00:21:14,622
I saw that.

419
00:21:14,689 --> 00:21:16,424
Shh.

420
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:17,992
We'll keep that between you and me.

421
00:21:19,061 --> 00:21:20,394
Where's the ladies' room?

422
00:21:20,462 --> 00:21:23,264
This way. I'll show you.

423
00:21:23,331 --> 00:21:24,298
Is that soda?

424
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,900
Um...

425
00:21:25,967 --> 00:21:27,234
Mmm.

426
00:21:27,302 --> 00:21:29,770
Vodka. Thank God.

427
00:21:36,611 --> 00:21:37,578
Damon, right?

428
00:21:37,646 --> 00:21:39,580
John.

429
00:21:39,648 --> 00:21:41,715
We didn't get a chance to
meet at the council meeting.

430
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:42,983
Yeah. It's... it's a pleasure.

431
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:45,019
Are you enjoying the, uh, kick-off?

432
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:47,054
Oh, yeah. Forgot how much fun

433
00:21:47,122 --> 00:21:48,622
these small-town celebrations can be.

434
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:49,523
Yeah. Yeah.

435
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,492
When's the last time you were here?

436
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,794
Hasn't been that long.
My brother's funeral

437
00:21:53,862 --> 00:21:55,996
how long have you been in town?

438
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,132
Well, not long at all.

439
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,434
So what do you think, Damon?

440
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:02,837
You know this vampire
problem is real, right?

441
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,305
It's a potential blood bath.

442
00:22:04,372 --> 00:22:05,773
I wouldn't overreact, John.

443
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:08,876
Oh, I think it's like 1864 all over again,

444
00:22:08,944 --> 00:22:10,244
vampires running amok.

445
00:22:10,312 --> 00:22:12,680
Guess we're just gonna
have to hunt them down,

446
00:22:12,747 --> 00:22:14,849
throw 'em in a church,
and burn them to Ash.

447
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,584
That is the story, huh?

448
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:18,486
Part of the story, yeah.

449
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,255
Oh, there's, uh... there's more?

450
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,591
Oh, there's a lot more.

451
00:22:23,658 --> 00:22:26,927
You see, seems there was
a tomb under the church

452
00:22:26,995 --> 00:22:28,863
where the vampires were hidden away,

453
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:30,831
waiting for someone to come
along and set them free.

454
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:35,035
But then you already
knew that, didn't you?

455
00:22:36,371 --> 00:22:38,139
Being that you're the one that did it.

456
00:22:41,076 --> 00:22:43,477
And you're telling me this why?

457
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:46,347
I just thought we'd get the
introductions out of the way.

458
00:22:46,414 --> 00:22:48,549
Well, you know that I
could rip your throat out

459
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,550
before anyone would notice.

460
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:50,985
Yeah. Yeah. Ok.

461
00:22:51,052 --> 00:22:52,620
But you probably ingest vervain, so...

462
00:22:52,687 --> 00:22:54,822
Why don't you take a bite, find out?

463
00:22:55,857 --> 00:22:57,525
It's not worth my time.

464
00:23:27,963 --> 00:23:29,731
Jer.

465
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:32,867
I, um... I heard about your
conversation with sheriff Forbes.

466
00:23:32,935 --> 00:23:35,503
No one is trying figure
out what happened to her.

467
00:23:35,571 --> 00:23:37,438
They're all willing to
believe that she oded.

468
00:23:37,506 --> 00:23:38,639
The coroner's office confirmed it.

469
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:40,241
If that's what they said happened, then...

470
00:23:40,309 --> 00:23:41,242
is that what you believe?

471
00:23:41,310 --> 00:23:44,045
What do you think happened?

472
00:23:44,113 --> 00:23:45,880
I think somebody killed
her and buried her body,

473
00:23:45,948 --> 00:23:49,484
and I don't think we should write
it off just 'cause it's easy.

474
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,219
They're just doing what
they can to move on.

475
00:23:51,286 --> 00:23:54,188
The truth is the only thing
that's gonna help people move on.

476
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:56,090
Jer, just... just let it go. Ok?

477
00:23:56,158 --> 00:23:58,393
Whatever it was, she's gone now.

478
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,762
Whatever it was?

479
00:24:01,797 --> 00:24:04,399
So you don't think it was an overdose.

480
00:24:04,466 --> 00:24:06,300
Yes. I... I do.

481
00:24:07,369 --> 00:24:09,103
Is there something you're not telling me?

482
00:24:10,572 --> 00:24:11,539
Why aren't you looking at me?

483
00:24:11,607 --> 00:24:13,374
Stop it. That doesn't mean anything.

484
00:24:14,743 --> 00:24:17,779
If there was something else,
you would tell me, right?

485
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:21,182
Of course I would.

486
00:24:23,819 --> 00:24:26,521
Oh, God. I ca... I can't even walk.

487
00:24:26,588 --> 00:24:27,655
I know. Me neither.

488
00:24:27,723 --> 00:24:29,357
Oh, God. Matt's gonna kill me.

489
00:24:29,425 --> 00:24:30,858
Ah, he won't even notice.

490
00:24:30,926 --> 00:24:33,895
I think he's actually letting
himself have some fun for once.

491
00:24:33,962 --> 00:24:36,230
Yeah, well... well, I
know I'm supposed to be

492
00:24:36,298 --> 00:24:40,201
on my best behavior because of Vicki,
but I don't wanna think about it.

493
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:42,703
I can't, 'cause if I do...

494
00:24:45,541 --> 00:24:47,775
Yeah, I was a dick to her.

495
00:24:47,843 --> 00:24:50,678
I was really bad.

496
00:24:50,746 --> 00:24:56,651
That's what I hate is I
can't make any of it right.

497
00:24:57,853 --> 00:25:01,155
It's like I don't deserve to even miss h.

498
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,097
You're nice to talk to me.

499
00:25:10,165 --> 00:25:13,868
I don't have anyone to talk to.

500
00:25:17,272 --> 00:25:20,508
I don't have anyone to talk to either.

501
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:26,814
Who knew I'd be missing all the
fun at the founder's parties?

502
00:25:26,882 --> 00:25:29,116
This is rare, believe me.

503
00:25:29,184 --> 00:25:32,086
Is it bad that I'm, uh, enjoying myself?

504
00:25:32,154 --> 00:25:35,590
No. It's great that
you're enjoying yourself.

505
00:25:35,657 --> 00:25:37,458
Thanks for making me dance.

506
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:38,693
Hey, not a problem.

507
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:42,263
Air. Ah heh.

508
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:43,965
Air. I need some air.

509
00:25:44,032 --> 00:25:45,800
Um, come with me?

510
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:48,536
Sure.

511
00:25:48,604 --> 00:25:49,871
You haven't seen my mom, have you?

512
00:25:49,938 --> 00:25:54,408
Um, no. Not in a while.

513
00:25:54,476 --> 00:25:56,377
All right.

514
00:26:02,117 --> 00:26:04,085
Oh, my God.

515
00:26:09,191 --> 00:26:10,858
What the hell are you doin', man?!

516
00:26:10,926 --> 00:26:11,859
Matt... mom!

517
00:26:11,927 --> 00:26:14,061
Whoa. Dude, calm down.

518
00:26:14,129 --> 00:26:16,230
Matt! No!

519
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,471
Tyler!

520
00:26:23,539 --> 00:26:25,139
Tyler! Matt! Stop it!

521
00:26:30,112 --> 00:26:31,279
Hey. Hey.

522
00:26:32,548 --> 00:26:33,581
Hey!

523
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:35,383
Stop!

524
00:26:36,318 --> 00:26:37,752
What the hell was that?

525
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:46,360
I'll take it from here.
I'll Te it from here.

526
00:26:47,362 --> 00:26:48,796
It's all right. It's ok.

527
00:26:48,864 --> 00:26:50,498
You hurt?

528
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,268
Go get cleaned up. It's ok.

529
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,603
Go get cleaned up.

530
00:26:55,671 --> 00:26:57,505
Thank you for your help.

531
00:26:58,774 --> 00:27:01,142
Everything's fine.
Everything's fine, everybody.

532
00:27:01,209 --> 00:27:03,945
Come on. Everybody back
to the party. Let's go.

533
00:27:04,012 --> 00:27:04,946
Come on. Have a good time.

534
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:06,981
Are you ok? Where is she?

535
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:09,684
I don't know.

536
00:27:09,751 --> 00:27:11,919
Come on. Put your head up.

537
00:27:19,861 --> 00:27:23,264
Do you wanna hear the bad
news or the really bad news?

538
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:26,467
Hmm. Actually I don't
want any news, Damon.

539
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:27,802
All right, let me rephrase.

540
00:27:27,869 --> 00:27:31,005
Do you wanna hear how the
council's back in vampire mode

541
00:27:31,073 --> 00:27:33,274
or how just killed uncle John Gilbert?

542
00:27:33,342 --> 00:27:34,542
What?

543
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:37,178
Great party by the way, huh?

544
00:27:39,615 --> 00:27:40,781
Damon.

545
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,270
Is everything all right?

546
00:28:05,073 --> 00:28:07,041
No.

547
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,878
I... I ruined it.

548
00:28:10,946 --> 00:28:12,680
I always ruin it.

549
00:28:12,748 --> 00:28:14,582
What is wrong with me?

550
00:28:15,684 --> 00:28:17,318
God.

551
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:33,801
What are you doing?

552
00:28:37,939 --> 00:28:40,141
Uh...

553
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:41,475
I'm sorry.

554
00:29:30,058 --> 00:29:32,593
You've gotta be kidding me.

555
00:29:33,047 --> 00:29:33,981
Thank you all.

556
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:35,048
Thank you very much. Thank you.

557
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,684
Thank you all for joining us tonight

558
00:29:37,752 --> 00:29:40,854
in just a few moments, we will
officially begin the countdown

559
00:29:40,921 --> 00:29:42,589
to our upcoming founder's day celebration,

560
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,391
and it's a very special one this year,

561
00:29:45,459 --> 00:29:48,594
the 150th birthday of our town.

562
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:54,867
And... and I would like to welcome back

563
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:57,270
one of our town's favorite sons

564
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,839
to do the honors of ringing
our official charter bell.

565
00:29:59,907 --> 00:30:02,108
John Gilbert, would you
please join me up here?

566
00:30:05,913 --> 00:30:11,551
150 years of community,
prosperity, family.

567
00:30:11,618 --> 00:30:13,419
We take care of each other,

568
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:17,623
look after each other, protect each other.

569
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,960
It's good to be home.

570
00:30:28,669 --> 00:30:30,636
Look at his right hand. Whose?

571
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:33,673
The town's favorite son. Look at his ring.

572
00:30:37,678 --> 00:30:39,679
Oh. That looks like mine.

573
00:30:39,746 --> 00:30:41,347
Yeah, and that would be a big coincidence

574
00:30:41,415 --> 00:30:43,816
if he didn't just come back
from the dead 5 minutes ago.

575
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:46,452
When the hell did you get that ring?

576
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,753
Isobel, my wife.

577
00:30:49,523 --> 00:30:55,895
Who gave birth Elena under the medical
care of the esteemed Dr. Grayson Gilbert,

578
00:30:55,963 --> 00:30:57,930
John's brother.

579
00:30:57,998 --> 00:31:00,933
Oh. You think John knew Isobel?

580
00:31:01,001 --> 00:31:03,836
I think John knows a lot of things.

581
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,717
Sorry about that, man.

582
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:20,553
No, really, I'm terribly sorry.

583
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:23,155
You don't wanna do this, man.

584
00:31:25,993 --> 00:31:27,460
Sorry about that, too.

585
00:31:27,527 --> 00:31:30,529
God, all I can do is apologize.

586
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,964
What's that about?

587
00:31:32,065 --> 00:31:34,634
Get out of my way, please.

588
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:39,572
No girl to show off for now?

589
00:31:41,241 --> 00:31:44,010
I see how this is. Heh.

590
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:02,495
Wh... what are you, man?

591
00:33:15,068 --> 00:33:16,235
Stefan.

592
00:33:19,973 --> 00:33:22,174
Stefan.

593
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:30,249
Hey. Hey, are you ok?

594
00:33:32,285 --> 00:33:33,319
What happened?

595
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,159
My arm.

596
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:43,496
I lost my balance and fell.

597
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,131
I'm clumsy.

598
00:33:58,755 --> 00:33:59,688
Let's go.

599
00:33:59,756 --> 00:34:00,724
Dad, I'm sorry.

600
00:34:00,792 --> 00:34:02,726
I don't even know what happened.

601
00:34:03,294 --> 00:34:04,795
I was drinking, and...

602
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:06,663
I lost control.

603
00:34:08,032 --> 00:34:09,466
Can't explain it.

604
00:34:14,704 --> 00:34:18,674
That is the last time you
ever embarrass this family.

605
00:34:33,423 --> 00:34:34,623
What are you doing?

606
00:34:34,691 --> 00:34:35,458
Matt, don't.

607
00:34:35,526 --> 00:34:38,727
I can't do it anymore,
mom, so just go, all right?

608
00:34:38,795 --> 00:34:40,896
You've done it before and
more times than I can count.

609
00:34:40,964 --> 00:34:43,332
I'm not leaving you.

610
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,733
Matty.

611
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:46,268
Mom!

612
00:34:46,336 --> 00:34:47,703
Don't you get it?

613
00:34:47,771 --> 00:34:50,372
I'm better off without you.

614
00:34:54,144 --> 00:34:55,344
No.

615
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,948
Tonight was a...

616
00:34:59,015 --> 00:35:00,616
God, I'm so sorry.

617
00:35:02,552 --> 00:35:06,255
I know I failed you, and I failed Vicki,

618
00:35:06,323 --> 00:35:09,558
but I won't do it to you again.

619
00:35:09,626 --> 00:35:11,861
I promise I'll get it together.

620
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:18,434
I want you out of the house...

621
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:22,304
And my life by morning.

622
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:25,341
Matty.

623
00:35:29,746 --> 00:35:32,014
Goin' somewhere? Hmm?

624
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:34,917
Never like to be the
last one to leave a party.

625
00:35:34,985 --> 00:35:35,985
It's too desperate.

626
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,720
You here to kill me again?

627
00:35:37,787 --> 00:35:40,089
Or you gonna let Mr.
Saltzman do your dirty work?

628
00:35:40,156 --> 00:35:41,891
Ok, you obviously know who I am.

629
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:44,460
I do. Alaric Saltzman,

630
00:35:44,528 --> 00:35:46,262
the high school history
teacher with a secret.

631
00:35:46,329 --> 00:35:49,064
Sure know a lot for someone
who just got to town.

632
00:35:49,132 --> 00:35:52,301
More than you can imagine, Damon.

633
00:35:52,369 --> 00:35:56,138
My knowledge of this town
goes beyond anything that you

634
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:58,741
you or the council knows.

635
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:02,077
So if you were planning
on some clever high-speed,

636
00:36:02,145 --> 00:36:03,479
snatch-ring, vamp kill move,

637
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:08,551
know that if I die everything
I know goes to the council,

638
00:36:08,618 --> 00:36:10,419
including the fascinating little tale

639
00:36:10,487 --> 00:36:11,787
of the original Salvatore brothers

640
00:36:11,888 --> 00:36:15,224
and their present-day
return to mystic falls.

641
00:36:15,292 --> 00:36:18,561
How'd you get that ring?

642
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:23,566
I inherited one, my brother
gray, the other. This was his.

643
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:25,200
And I wouldn't have given mine to Isobel

644
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,336
had I known she'd hand
it over to another guy.

645
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:28,971
So you did know her.

646
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,573
Who do you think sent her your way

647
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,974
when she wanted to become a vampire?

648
00:36:32,042 --> 00:36:33,008
You sent her?

649
00:36:33,076 --> 00:36:34,610
Guilty.

650
00:36:34,678 --> 00:36:36,478
Why, did you think someone else sent her?

651
00:36:36,546 --> 00:36:37,947
Maybe Katherine Pierce?

652
00:36:38,882 --> 00:36:40,816
How do you know about Katherine?

653
00:36:40,884 --> 00:36:42,451
How do I know anything, Damon?

654
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,320
What do you want?

655
00:36:44,387 --> 00:36:45,821
So many questions.

656
00:36:47,023 --> 00:36:48,424
It was a pleasure meeting you, Rick.

657
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:50,726
I've heard so much about you.

658
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:06,141
Not so excited that we have another
month of these founder's day events.

659
00:37:06,209 --> 00:37:08,043
Tell me about it.

660
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:11,614
You ok?

661
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:13,048
Fine.

662
00:37:14,084 --> 00:37:15,050
Are you sure?

663
00:37:15,118 --> 00:37:17,152
I'm fine, Elena.

664
00:37:35,238 --> 00:37:37,706
Oh, my God. You scared me.

665
00:37:37,774 --> 00:37:39,008
Sorry.

666
00:37:40,076 --> 00:37:42,745
I'm sorry that I... I ran off earlier.

667
00:37:42,812 --> 00:37:44,046
What happened?

668
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:45,781
Is everything ok?

669
00:37:49,252 --> 00:37:51,120
Uh...

670
00:37:51,187 --> 00:37:52,755
No.

671
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:54,390
Talk to me.

672
00:38:03,566 --> 00:38:05,734
Stefan, tell me.

673
00:38:06,803 --> 00:38:08,570
I tried...

674
00:38:08,638 --> 00:38:10,939
So hard to keep it together tonight.

675
00:38:11,007 --> 00:38:14,076
And it was working. It was working,

676
00:38:14,144 --> 00:38:17,613
uh, but... but then Matt's mom, she,h,

677
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:19,615
got hurt, and she was bleeding,

678
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:22,451
and I had her... her blood on my hands.

679
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:24,219
And then what happened?

680
00:38:24,287 --> 00:38:26,488
And then that... that
guy in the parking lot,

681
00:38:26,556 --> 00:38:28,123
I wanted to feed on him,

682
00:38:28,191 --> 00:38:31,060
and it took everything
inside of me not to do it.

683
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:32,127
But you didn't?

684
00:38:32,195 --> 00:38:34,329
No, but I wanted to.

685
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:35,364
God.

686
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:38,100
Elena, I... my...

687
00:38:38,168 --> 00:38:41,003
my head is pounding,

688
00:38:41,071 --> 00:38:45,174
I feel like my... skin
is on... is on fire.

689
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:47,643
I have this hunger inside
of me that I've never...

690
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:49,712
I've never felt before in my entire life,

691
00:38:49,779 --> 00:38:51,747
and all I keep thinking about

692
00:38:51,815 --> 00:38:54,316
is how I promised that I would
never keep anything from you,

693
00:38:54,384 --> 00:38:55,651
and so I'm telling you this.

694
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,986
That's ok. I need you
to tell me these things.

695
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:00,189
But I don't want you to see me like this.

696
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,858
I don't want you to know
that this side of me exists.

697
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:04,426
Stefan, you're gonna get through this.

698
00:39:04,494 --> 00:39:05,928
I'm gonna help you pull through.

699
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:08,163
It's gonna be ok. You're gonna be ok.

700
00:39:08,231 --> 00:39:09,598
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

701
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:14,236
No, I'm sorry. I can't.

702
00:39:14,304 --> 00:39:19,041
I... I'm afraid of what I could do to you.

703
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:23,946
I'm not.

704
00:39:25,515 --> 00:39:26,381
Stefan.

705
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:28,650
Stefan, I'm not.

706
00:39:32,288 --> 00:39:35,290
I'm not, ok?

707
00:39:46,236 --> 00:39:48,704
I love you so much.

708
00:39:49,606 --> 00:39:52,341
Oh, I love you, too.

709
00:40:03,286 --> 00:40:04,887
We have a problem, Stefan.

710
00:40:04,954 --> 00:40:08,657
And when I say, "problem,
" I mean global crisis.

711
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,595
Seems uncle John has a...

712
00:40:16,366 --> 00:40:18,267
