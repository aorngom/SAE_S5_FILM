<i>Previously on The Vampire Diaries...</i>

2
00:00:02,007 --> 00:00:04,782
<i>For over a century,
I have lived in secret until now.</i>

3
00:00:04,907 --> 00:00:07,340
<i>I know the risk,
but I have to know her.</i>

4
00:00:07,508 --> 00:00:10,217
She's a dead ringer for Katherine.
Hello, brother.

5
00:00:11,023 --> 00:00:14,650
He killed Zach. He killed Tanner.
He turned Vicki.

6
00:00:14,775 --> 00:00:16,557
I have to kill him.

7
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,683
- You can't do that.
- You were right to stay away from me.

8
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:22,084
- What is that?
- A very important crystal.

9
00:00:22,209 --> 00:00:25,382
That belonged to one of the most
powerful witches of our family.

10
00:00:25,507 --> 00:00:27,485
- Emily Bennet.
- I want my crystal back.

11
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:29,350
- Bonnie has it.
- Get it from her.

12
00:00:29,475 --> 00:00:31,614
Don't be giving that back
to anybody.

13
00:00:32,457 --> 00:00:35,326
Today we're going to talk
about shadow reckoning.

14
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:38,944
This is a method of measuring
heights by the sun's shadow.

15
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:40,660
Let's say, for example,

16
00:00:40,785 --> 00:00:43,501
that we're going to measure
the distance of the shadow.

17
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:46,585
We're gonna take
this measurement here,

18
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:49,240
Measure the length,

19
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:54,522
and we're going to multiply that
by the height of the source.

20
00:00:55,104 --> 00:00:57,723
Building height can also
be measured, using a...

21
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:24,784
Hello?

22
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:14,717
Please help me.

23
00:02:15,118 --> 00:02:16,218
Who are you?

24
00:02:16,843 --> 00:02:17,843
I'm Emily.

25
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,047
You know that.

26
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:22,641
We're family.

27
00:02:23,518 --> 00:02:24,518
Where am I?

28
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:28,767
This is where it started.

29
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,319
And this is where it has to end.

30
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,860
This isn't real.

31
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:39,438
Help me.

32
00:02:45,934 --> 00:02:48,334
What are you looking at?
Turn around.

Mystic Falls Team
1x09 - History Repeating

34
00:03:03,952 --> 00:03:06,411
- Have you even talked to Bonnie?
- I'm mad at her.

35
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:09,188
- She needs to make the first move.
- Be the bigger person.

36
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,206
Impossible in her presence.

37
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:14,295
Why are you so pissed
at her, anyway?

38
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,166
She's a thief. That's why.

39
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,135
I gave her my necklace,
and she refuses to give it back.

40
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,658
It's a matter of principle.

41
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,308
All right. Well, I tried.
I'm officially out of it.

42
00:03:23,433 --> 00:03:24,733
Good. Your turn.

43
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:27,149
Where's Stefan?
Have you talked to him?

44
00:03:27,274 --> 00:03:29,124
- He's avoiding me.
- Why?

45
00:03:29,747 --> 00:03:31,168
It's complicated.

46
00:03:31,869 --> 00:03:33,254
I'll see you later.

47
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:53,399
Good morning, everyone.

48
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,279
Alrighty.

49
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,078
<i>Are you alright?</i>

50
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:19,091
It's a mouthful. I know.

51
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:22,970
Doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.
Saltzman is of German origins.

52
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:27,266
My family emigrated here
in 1755 to Texas.

53
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,084
I, however, was born
and raised in Boston.

54
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:32,113
Now, the name Alaric

55
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:36,817
belongs to a very dead great-grandfather
I will never be able to thank enough.

56
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:40,144
You'll probably want to
pronounce it "Alaric," but it's...

57
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:41,875
"Alaric," okay?

58
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:44,626
So you can call me Rick.

59
00:04:45,874 --> 00:04:47,640
I'm your new history teacher.

60
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,163
Rise and shine.

61
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:51,790
You'll be late for school.

62
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:53,408
What are you doin'?

63
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:55,191
Peace offering.

64
00:04:57,303 --> 00:05:00,591
Come on. You need it for blood
circulation. Does dead flesh good?

65
00:05:03,298 --> 00:05:05,763
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Step aside, please.

66
00:05:07,238 --> 00:05:11,242
I got the town off our back. It was
for the greater good but I'm sorry.

67
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,919
And to prove it,
I'm not gonna feed on a human

68
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:16,394
for at least a...

69
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,650
week.

70
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,861
I'll adopt the Stefan diet,
only nothing with feathers.

71
00:05:21,033 --> 00:05:23,233
Cause I realize that killing your

72
00:05:23,358 --> 00:05:26,210
closest and oldest friend
is beyond evil, and yet

73
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,827
somehow, it's worthy of humor.

74
00:05:30,184 --> 00:05:32,386
- Are you mimicking me?
- Yes, Stefan.

75
00:05:32,511 --> 00:05:36,089
Now that the secret society
of vampire haters is off our back,

76
00:05:36,214 --> 00:05:40,218
I can go back to my routine of how
can I destroy Stefan's life this week.

77
00:05:40,866 --> 00:05:44,134
And I can go back to sulking
and Elena-longing

78
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,512
and forehead brooding.
This is fun. I like this.

79
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,583
And I will finally reveal
the ulterior motive

80
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:52,267
behind my evil and diabolical
return to Mystic Falls.

81
00:05:54,294 --> 00:05:55,813
Yeah. I'm done.

82
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,974
That's just like you, Damon.
Always have to have the last word.

83
00:06:02,455 --> 00:06:04,884
And then I ended up at
the remains of old fell's church

84
00:06:05,009 --> 00:06:06,907
before I woke up back in the woods.

85
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,575
And you always see
your ancestor Emily?

86
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,372
Do you believe in ghosts?

87
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:16,250
Two weeks ago,
I'd say no, but now...

88
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:17,835
I think I'm being haunted.

89
00:06:19,318 --> 00:06:20,900
I don't get it. Why Emily?

90
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:23,757
Grams said she was a powerful
witch back in the civil war days

91
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:26,552
and that this medallion was hers,
a witch's talisman.

92
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,721
And it all started when
you got the necklace?

93
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,268
I think she's using it
to communicate with me.

94
00:06:31,393 --> 00:06:33,058
What does Grams say about it?

95
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:35,436
I can't call her. She's gonna
tell me to embrace it.

96
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,147
I don't want to embrace it.
I want it to stop.

97
00:06:43,218 --> 00:06:45,818
I'm Jeremy Gilbert.
You wanted to see me?

98
00:06:49,312 --> 00:06:51,312
You know that your old teacher

99
00:06:51,743 --> 00:06:52,995
had a jackass file?

100
00:06:54,044 --> 00:06:56,498
No joke.
It's... typed on a label.

101
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:59,460
It has all the...
troublemakers in it,

102
00:06:59,634 --> 00:07:01,908
but really it's just an opus...

103
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:03,297
to you.

104
00:07:07,817 --> 00:07:09,261
Don't worry about it.

105
00:07:10,246 --> 00:07:11,346
I'm not him.

106
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:12,890
Clean slate.

107
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:14,729
Now...

108
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:19,299
- Let's talk about grades.
- I know it's been a rough

109
00:07:19,424 --> 00:07:22,118
couple of months, but I've been
trying to turn them around.

110
00:07:22,243 --> 00:07:26,247
I saw that, but the problem is we're
halfway through a semester and...

111
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,324
half a fail is still pretty bleak.

112
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:33,042
This is the part where you say to me,
"What can I do to change that?"

113
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:34,617
I'm glad you asked.

114
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:37,456
- How do you feel about extra credit?
- Yeah, totally. Whatever.

115
00:07:37,866 --> 00:07:39,625
Good. Write me a paper then.

116
00:07:40,095 --> 00:07:41,794
- Okay. About what?
- History.

117
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,964
Pick a topic. Keep it local.
No <i>Wikipedia regurgita</i>.

118
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,967
These old towns have
a lot of rich history, so just...

119
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,763
get your hands dirty, make it sing,
and you're back on track.

120
00:07:54,436 --> 00:07:56,391
- Deal?
- Yeah. Deal.

121
00:08:00,047 --> 00:08:01,497
That's a cool ring.

122
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:03,565
Thanks. It was my father's.

123
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,306
Little garish, but family.

124
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:09,207
You know.

125
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,642
You've got a week.

126
00:08:20,931 --> 00:08:22,081
What is that?

127
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,954
- What is what?
- The "Hey."

128
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,479
That's twice.
That is 2 heys. That...

129
00:08:28,604 --> 00:08:31,051
Do you have any other words
in your vocabulary?

130
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:34,014
- What's wrong with "Hey"?
- It reeks of awkward subtext.

131
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,475
You spent the night in my bed,
there was...

132
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,143
cuddling, and then you snuck out before
dawn so you wouldn't have to face me,

133
00:08:40,268 --> 00:08:43,812
which I must say is a total lame
guy move that I did not appreciate.

134
00:08:43,937 --> 00:08:46,244
And now with the Heys?
Seriously? I mean,

135
00:08:46,369 --> 00:08:49,903
I may have been some pathetic,
insecure mess after the party but,

136
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,442
do not mistake that
for me being a pushover,

137
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,275
Because I do not let guys
mess with my head anymore.

138
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,560
I heard your mom in the morning and
I didn't want to get you in trouble

139
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:00,080
so I went out the window.

140
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,677
You went out the window?
Another lame guy move.

141
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:05,214
Your mom's the sheriff.
And as for the heys,

142
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,380
I'm pretty sure it's what I've said
to you every day since the first grade.

143
00:09:12,344 --> 00:09:14,636
Trying to read something into it...

144
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,013
Lame girl move.

145
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,571
You weren't in class.
I was worried.

146
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:36,439
I got your messages, and sorry
I didn't get back to you, but...

147
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,869
What I wanna say shouldn't
be said over the phone.

148
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,042
A simple "I didn't kill my brother"
text would have sufficed.

149
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:44,667
I didn't kill my brother,
As much as he

150
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:47,461
deserved it.
He has you to thank for that.

151
00:09:48,592 --> 00:09:50,130
So what did you wanna tell me?

152
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:52,799
I won't be coming to school anymore.

153
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,385
I'm gonna back off
and keep my distance.

154
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,012
It's the right thing to do.

155
00:09:58,264 --> 00:10:00,790
Back off from school or...

156
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:02,768
from me?

157
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,730
Thank you for telling me.

158
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:14,446
- It's better this way.
- Yep. I got it.

159
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:18,346
You're angry.
That's good.

160
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,911
Be easier if you hate me.

161
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:29,777
Okay, it's your last chance.

162
00:10:30,786 --> 00:10:32,026
I'm gonna scream.

163
00:10:32,151 --> 00:10:34,401
Don't do that. Let's stay on point.

164
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:37,034
I want my necklace.

165
00:10:37,159 --> 00:10:38,582
You can't have it.

166
00:10:38,707 --> 00:10:41,842
I can't take it but you can give it
to me. I'm trying to help you here.

167
00:10:41,967 --> 00:10:44,121
- I don't want your help.
- You do want my help,

168
00:10:44,246 --> 00:10:46,684
and you don't even know it.
You know why, you little witch?

169
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:49,419
Cause you've stumbled into
something you need to stumble out of.

170
00:10:49,544 --> 00:10:52,416
- Just leave me alone or I swear...
- Don't. No threats.

171
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,361
A, you hurt me last time.

172
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,645
B, I wish you no harm.

173
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,140
Believe it or not, Bonnie,
I wanna protect you.

174
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:02,327
Let me help you
get Emily off your back.

175
00:11:03,654 --> 00:11:05,956
- How do you know about her?
- I know a lot of things,

176
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:08,334
and I know more about
that crystal than you do,

177
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,335
and I know that she's using it

178
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,153
to creep inside of you.

179
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,775
See how scared you are?

180
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,459
And you should be,
because I will get that crystal,

181
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:21,054
even if I have to wait for
Emily to give it to me herself.

182
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,978
Next time she comes out to play,
you tell her...

183
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,564
That a deal's a deal.

184
00:11:36,589 --> 00:11:39,614
He's bad news, Elena.
He really scared me.

185
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,646
You need to stay as far away
from Damon as possible.

186
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,454
I'm trying. He just
keeps showing up.

187
00:11:47,031 --> 00:11:50,625
I don't want you to be alone.
You're sleeping at my place tonight.

188
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,093
We can make a whole night out of it.

189
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,680
Where are you going?

190
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,988
- Are you okay?
- Now I am.

191
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,213
All my problems were
because of that thing.

192
00:12:22,338 --> 00:12:24,159
Can't believe
I didn't do that sooner.

193
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,036
What's your Grams gonna say?

194
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,498
Grams isn't the one being haunted
by a 150-year-old ghost, is she?

195
00:12:30,855 --> 00:12:32,094
Okay, then.

196
00:12:36,036 --> 00:12:38,006
I like a man who can dine alone.

197
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,466
A quiet strength.

198
00:12:39,963 --> 00:12:42,636
I thought you were still in that
whole Logan depression thing.

199
00:12:42,804 --> 00:12:44,429
I've sworn off men forever,

200
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,355
but it doesn't mean I can't
observe them from a safe distance.

201
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,226
Well, I can introduce you.

202
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:02,197
Thanks for coming. I wouldn't
have called if it wasn't important.

203
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,365
I know that.

204
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:09,215
- He threatened her.
- What would Damon want with Bonnie?

205
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,829
She has this necklace.
Caroline got it from Damon,

206
00:13:11,954 --> 00:13:13,375
and she gave it Bonnie,

207
00:13:13,543 --> 00:13:16,294
and now Damon wants it back.
He's tormenting her.

208
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,668
- Over a necklace.
- It's not just any necklace.

209
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,597
It has to do with Bonnie's heritage.

210
00:13:21,722 --> 00:13:25,726
It belonged to one of her ancestors
who lived here during the civil war.

211
00:13:28,664 --> 00:13:30,183
When you and Damon lived here.

212
00:13:31,518 --> 00:13:32,968
Her name was Emily.

213
00:13:33,797 --> 00:13:36,690
She was Katherine's handmaid
and a witch.

214
00:13:37,781 --> 00:13:38,781
You know?

215
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:40,756
About Bonnie?

216
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:43,947
The first night that you invited me
over for dinner, I made the connection.

217
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,860
And... now Damon knows, and...

218
00:13:48,254 --> 00:13:50,162
for some reason,
he wants that necklace.

219
00:13:50,607 --> 00:13:52,942
- What does it look like?
- It's...

220
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,779
- an antique iron setting with...
- With an amber crystal.

221
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,646
I know it. It belonged to Katherine.

222
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:59,796
Emily gave it to her,
which means that...

223
00:14:00,777 --> 00:14:01,777
What?

224
00:14:03,277 --> 00:14:05,677
I don't know,
but I'm gonna find out.

225
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:08,545
- Let me talk to Damon.
- Will he tell you?

226
00:14:12,682 --> 00:14:14,227
I'll get it out of him.

227
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,491
Have you picked a topic?

228
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:23,906
No, not yet. It's gotta be local
and non-Internet research, so...

229
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,231
That's easy.
You got all your dad's stuff.

230
00:14:26,356 --> 00:14:28,267
- What stuff?
- How the Gilberts came over

231
00:14:28,392 --> 00:14:31,578
on the Mayflower stuff, all that
family lineage from way back.

232
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:34,896
Your dad really loved
all that family history stuff.

233
00:14:35,216 --> 00:14:37,316
It's all boxed up in the closet.

234
00:14:43,181 --> 00:14:44,431
What's up, man?

235
00:14:45,148 --> 00:14:46,748
This is my aunt Jenna.

236
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:48,995
It's nice to meet you.

237
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,498
Jeremy was just
telling me about his paper.

238
00:14:51,788 --> 00:14:53,934
Thanks for giving him
another chance.

239
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:57,062
It was my first day. I wanted
to make a good impression.

240
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,716
So, Stefan...

241
00:15:03,778 --> 00:15:05,578
You know, I been thinking.

242
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:07,614
I think we should start over,

243
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,855
give this brother thing
another chance.

244
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,880
We used to do it, oh,
so well once upon a time.

245
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,506
I don't, Damon.

246
00:15:15,812 --> 00:15:17,894
I can't trust you to be a nice guy.

247
00:15:18,019 --> 00:15:20,156
You kill everybody,
and you're so mean.

248
00:15:20,281 --> 00:15:21,753
You're so mean, and...

249
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,882
You're really hard to imitate, and then
I have to go to that lesser place.

250
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,846
Can I get a coffee, please?

251
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:29,771
So what's with the bottle?

252
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:33,306
I'm on edge. Crash diet, and
I'm trying to keep a low profile.

253
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,437
You could always just leave,
find a new town

254
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:37,686
to turn into your own
personal gas and sip.

255
00:15:37,854 --> 00:15:38,937
I'll manage.

256
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:45,789
- You don't have to keep an eye on me.
- I'm not here to keep an eye on you.

257
00:15:45,914 --> 00:15:48,029
- So why are you here?
- Why not?

258
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:07,674
I'm sorry.
There. I said it.

259
00:16:08,188 --> 00:16:10,760
If you want the ugly-ass necklace,
Keep it.

260
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:11,928
It's yours.

261
00:16:14,281 --> 00:16:16,600
Will you hate me if
I tell you I threw it away?

262
00:16:17,229 --> 00:16:19,644
- You threw it away?
- I know it sounds crazy but

263
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,352
the necklace was giving me
nightmares. I had to get rid of it.

264
00:16:22,477 --> 00:16:24,347
You could have just
given it back to me.

265
00:16:24,472 --> 00:16:26,445
Why? So you could
give it back to Damon?

266
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,652
Screw Damon.

267
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,697
Are we doing manicures
or what? Who has their kit?

268
00:16:30,982 --> 00:16:32,332
Mine's in my bag.

269
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,439
How long do you think this fight
with Stefan's gonna last? Is it...

270
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,373
like a permanent thing?

271
00:16:40,776 --> 00:16:42,426
I don't know, Caroline.

272
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:46,717
Why are you such
a little liar, Bonnie?

273
00:16:46,842 --> 00:16:47,842
What?

274
00:17:00,628 --> 00:17:02,937
I'm not lying to you,
Caroline. I swear.

275
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:05,273
It's true.
I watched her throw it into a field.

276
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,524
Then explain it.

277
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,928
- Who's Emily?
- The ghost.

278
00:17:11,614 --> 00:17:13,990
- The ghost has a name now?
- Caroline, please.

279
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,125
I wonder why
she won't leave me alone.

280
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,245
What is going on? Why
am I not a part of this conversation?

281
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:21,956
- You guys do this to me all the time.
- That's not true.

282
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,174
Yes, it is.

283
00:17:24,192 --> 00:17:26,044
I can't talk to you.
You don't listen.

284
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,512
That's not true.

285
00:17:28,477 --> 00:17:29,589
I'm a witch.

286
00:17:29,785 --> 00:17:31,716
- And don't we all know it?
- See?

287
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,926
That's what I'm talking about.
I'm trying to tell you something.

288
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:36,554
You don't even hear it.

289
00:17:39,048 --> 00:17:41,726
I listen.
When do I not listen?

290
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,983
Jeremy totally ditched me.

291
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:47,858
- Where'd he go?
- Home.

292
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,734
It's not far. He can walk it.

293
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,195
So are you from here?
Are you a townie?

294
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:55,782
I'm a returnee.
Left town for a while. Now I'm back.

295
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,826
- Why'd you leave?
- School.

296
00:18:01,299 --> 00:18:03,540
And then there's the real reason.

297
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:06,826
I was wronged.

298
00:18:07,364 --> 00:18:08,628
Guy named Logan.

299
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,922
- What'd he do?
- Basics...

300
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,633
Lied, cheated,
lured me back in, left me again.

301
00:18:15,916 --> 00:18:18,466
Your turn. Any sad
relationship stories?

302
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,249
The basics...

303
00:18:21,401 --> 00:18:22,551
Fell in love,

304
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,018
married young,

305
00:18:24,941 --> 00:18:26,091
my wife died.

306
00:18:31,388 --> 00:18:33,903
That's always a good
conversation stopper.

307
00:18:35,086 --> 00:18:37,365
- What happened?
- Well, you, me, and the...

308
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,776
North Carolina police department
are all wondering the same thing.

309
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,771
It's what's known as a cold case.

310
00:18:46,932 --> 00:18:49,335
- So why'd you move here?
- A change of pace,

311
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:50,603
new scenery.

312
00:18:50,966 --> 00:18:52,616
I like it here. It's...

313
00:18:52,807 --> 00:18:54,257
Got a rich history.

314
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:58,228
Lucky shot.

315
00:18:58,353 --> 00:19:01,347
More like a carefully honed
skill over many decades.

316
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:06,644
- You're beating me.
- It's because I'm better than you.

317
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,355
I'm onto you.
Reverse psychology.

318
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,108
It's a little transparent,
but I admire the effort.

319
00:19:12,536 --> 00:19:14,686
You prefer the brooding forehead?

320
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,973
Seriously, what game
do you think you're playing?

321
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:20,946
That's a funny question
considering the fact

322
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:24,078
that I have been asking
you that for months.

323
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,665
- It's frustrating, isn't it?
- Touché.

324
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,196
Look, it's just not me.

325
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,625
I don't believe in the...

326
00:19:45,883 --> 00:19:48,728
But if you do, then...
okay. I'm in.

327
00:19:49,095 --> 00:19:52,344
That's all it takes for me
to jump onboard, because

328
00:19:53,602 --> 00:19:55,693
I consider you to be my best friend.

329
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,695
And I'm saying this knowing that

330
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,365
Elena's in the kitchen
listening to my every word.

331
00:20:04,588 --> 00:20:07,138
I didn't know
how real this was for you,

332
00:20:07,387 --> 00:20:08,987
but I'm listening now.

333
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,343
Elena, you can
come in now. We're done.

334
00:20:25,364 --> 00:20:28,214
There is just way too
much drama in this room.

335
00:20:28,707 --> 00:20:30,520
So what do you guys wanna do?

336
00:20:31,317 --> 00:20:34,107
I have an idea.
Why don't we have a séance?

337
00:20:35,035 --> 00:20:37,193
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Come on.

338
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,903
Let's summon some spirits.

339
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:42,115
This Emily chick has some
serious explaining to do.

340
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,364
- What are we doing?
- I don't know.

341
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,459
Be quiet and concentrate.

342
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,837
Close your eyes.

343
00:20:57,264 --> 00:20:58,923
Now take a deep breath.

344
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,013
Call to her.

345
00:21:07,997 --> 00:21:08,997
You there?

346
00:21:09,978 --> 00:21:12,478
Really? "Emily, you there?"
That's all you got?

347
00:21:12,767 --> 00:21:14,517
- Come on.
- Fine. Jeez.

348
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:22,184
I call on you.

349
00:21:23,553 --> 00:21:25,353
I know you have a message.

350
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:28,161
I'm here to listen.

351
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,288
- Did that just...
- Yeah. It just happened.

352
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,725
It's just the air conditioning.

353
00:21:44,804 --> 00:21:46,654
Ask her to show you a sign.

354
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:47,889
Ask her.

355
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:52,018
If you're among us,

356
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:53,811
show us another sign.

357
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:01,235
See? It's not working.

358
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:09,002
I can't. I'm done.

359
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:13,668
Get the light. Please get the light.

360
00:22:13,793 --> 00:22:15,193
Hold on. I got it.

361
00:22:17,735 --> 00:22:18,735
You guys,

362
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,630
the necklace, it's gone.

363
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,008
- What are we doin' here?
- Bonding. Catch.

364
00:22:41,801 --> 00:22:42,801
Go on.

365
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,812
Give it a try.

366
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:50,374
Don't forget who taught
you how to play this game.

367
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:00,211
That hurt.

368
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,979
Downside of my diet...

369
00:23:03,068 --> 00:23:05,618
Getting hit
actually hurts a little bit.

370
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,403
I'm impressed, Stefan.

371
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:13,060
Fun with booze and darts,

372
00:23:13,323 --> 00:23:15,523
Sentimental with football, and now

373
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:17,811
starry night.

374
00:23:23,202 --> 00:23:24,952
What do you want, Stefan?

375
00:23:30,432 --> 00:23:32,368
It wasn't real, Damon.

376
00:23:34,234 --> 00:23:35,884
Our love for Katherine.

377
00:23:37,239 --> 00:23:39,555
She compelled us.
We didn't have a choice.

378
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,335
Took me years to sort that out,

379
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,003
to truly understand
what she did to us.

380
00:23:45,638 --> 00:23:47,838
We are not takin' that on tonight.

381
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:56,100
What do you want
with Katherine's crystal?

382
00:23:58,784 --> 00:24:00,634
How do you know about that?

383
00:24:01,802 --> 00:24:04,233
Come on. You knew
Elena would tell me.

384
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,945
How did you know it was Katherine's?

385
00:24:08,392 --> 00:24:10,448
Emily gave it to her
on her last night.

386
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:13,117
I was with her, and you weren't.

387
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:17,330
I was the last one to see her.

388
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,611
Now, what do you want
with Katherine's crystal?

389
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,552
- She didn't tell you?
- We had other things on our mind.

390
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:38,392
I could rip your heart out
and not think twice about it.

391
00:24:40,463 --> 00:24:41,854
I've heard that before.

392
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,009
I have a bigger surprise, Stefan.

393
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,368
I'm gonna bring her back.

394
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:05,837
Fun's over, Caroline.
You made a point, and I get it.

395
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:08,589
- Now give it back.
- What? Well, I didn't take it.

396
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,702
- What? What happened?
- I don't know. Nothing.

397
00:25:14,827 --> 00:25:16,650
Jeremy, are you home?

398
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,350
Guys...

399
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,325
<i>You guys open the door!</i>

400
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,803
- <i>Help me!</i>
- What's going on?

401
00:25:56,437 --> 00:25:59,223
Try the other door.
I'll check the hallway.

402
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,062
Unlock the door!

403
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,391
Open the door!

404
00:26:25,217 --> 00:26:26,959
What happened?
Are you okay?

405
00:26:35,415 --> 00:26:36,415
I'm fine.

406
00:26:37,614 --> 00:26:40,214
Unbelievable.
You were totally faking it.

407
00:26:40,339 --> 00:26:42,808
- Come on.
- No, you scared the hell out of me.

408
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:49,338
I'm fine.

409
00:26:50,932 --> 00:26:52,318
Everything's fine.

410
00:27:00,753 --> 00:27:03,982
- How can you bring Katherine back?
- Before Katherine and the others

411
00:27:04,107 --> 00:27:06,967
were killed in the church, you remember
what it was like in this town?

412
00:27:07,092 --> 00:27:10,149
- I remember the fear and the hysteria.
- Townspeople were killing vampires

413
00:27:10,274 --> 00:27:13,009
one by one. When they came for
Katherine, I went straight to Emily,

414
00:27:13,134 --> 00:27:16,561
said, "I'll do anything. Name
your price. Just protect her." She did.

415
00:27:17,207 --> 00:27:18,207
How?

416
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,287
She did some kind of spell
with the crystal.

417
00:27:20,412 --> 00:27:23,383
And while the church was burning,
we thought Katherine was burning in it.

418
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,024
- She wasn't.
- But I saw her go inside.

419
00:27:26,149 --> 00:27:27,349
There's a tomb

420
00:27:28,324 --> 00:27:32,026
underneath the church. The spell sealed
Katherine in that tomb, protecting her.

421
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:34,097
Are you telling me
that Katherine's alive?

422
00:27:34,222 --> 00:27:36,453
If that's what you wanna call it.
She's been trapped

423
00:27:36,578 --> 00:27:39,212
in a mystical holding cell
for the last century and a half, but

424
00:27:39,337 --> 00:27:41,673
you're an expert
on a starving a vampire, so

425
00:27:41,798 --> 00:27:43,244
how do you think she's doing?

426
00:27:45,056 --> 00:27:47,264
Did you know that witches can use

427
00:27:47,389 --> 00:27:49,755
celestial events to draw
energy into their magic?

428
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,880
Me either.

429
00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:54,560
But in order to give
the crystal its power,

430
00:27:54,685 --> 00:27:57,133
Emily used the comet
that was passing overhead,

431
00:27:57,618 --> 00:28:00,468
And in order for that
crystal to work again...

432
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:04,163
- The comet had to return.
- Downside...

433
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:07,416
Long time in between comets
and a couple of

434
00:28:07,541 --> 00:28:10,363
hiccups along the way with the crystal
but the comet passed,

435
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:13,613
and I got the crystal.
And then Caroline got the crystal,

436
00:28:13,738 --> 00:28:16,381
and now Bonnie has the crystal,
and here we are.

437
00:28:16,506 --> 00:28:18,829
Why would Emily...
Why would she do this for you?

438
00:28:18,954 --> 00:28:22,054
Because she knew they were
gonna come for her, too,

439
00:28:22,326 --> 00:28:24,971
and she made me promise
that her lineage would survive.

440
00:28:25,096 --> 00:28:27,714
I remember.
You saved her children.

441
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:29,912
It's the only thing
keeping me from ripping

442
00:28:30,037 --> 00:28:32,876
that little Bonnie girl's throat out
to get my crystal back.

443
00:28:33,001 --> 00:28:34,670
Well. A deal's a deal.

444
00:28:35,161 --> 00:28:36,161
So...

445
00:28:37,818 --> 00:28:39,768
You wanna go throw some more?

446
00:28:41,163 --> 00:28:43,069
I can't believe I fell for it.

447
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:44,750
- Are you okay?
- I must go.

448
00:28:44,875 --> 00:28:47,391
- She's leaving, I'm leaving.
- You guys can't leave.

449
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,278
I can. I've had enough freaky fake
witch stuff for one night.

450
00:28:50,403 --> 00:28:51,979
Thank you for having me.

451
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:54,940
- I'll take it from here.
- Where are you going?

452
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:56,859
Back to where it all began.

453
00:29:03,585 --> 00:29:06,202
I won't let him have it.
It must be destroyed.

454
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,710
Wait!

455
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:17,680
- What's happening?
- I don't know. The door, it's not...

456
00:29:18,966 --> 00:29:20,166
What the hell?

457
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:26,055
I'm outta here.

458
00:29:37,842 --> 00:29:39,642
- What's wrong?
- <i>It's Bonnie.</i>

459
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,904
- What happened?
- <i>Emily is possessing her.</i>

460
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:44,039
- She said something.
- What did she say?

461
00:29:44,164 --> 00:29:47,518
<i>She said</i>, "I won't let him have it.
It must be destroyed,"

462
00:29:47,686 --> 00:29:50,382
- <i>And then she just left.</i>
- Where do you think she went?

463
00:29:50,507 --> 00:29:51,705
<i>I don't know.</i>

464
00:29:53,446 --> 00:29:54,646
Fell's church,

465
00:29:54,771 --> 00:29:57,920
<i>By the old cemetery that's where
she took Bonnie in her dreams.</i>

466
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,880
We have to help her, Stefan.

467
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,580
Just stay there.
I'm gonna go find her.

468
00:30:10,714 --> 00:30:12,164
You look different.

469
00:30:13,003 --> 00:30:15,074
- I won't let you do it.
- We had a deal.

470
00:30:15,199 --> 00:30:18,236
Things are different now.
I need to protect my family.

471
00:30:18,361 --> 00:30:21,110
I protected your family.
You owe me.

472
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,278
I know.

473
00:30:23,889 --> 00:30:24,989
I'm sorry.

474
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,253
You're about to be
a lot more than that.

475
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,240
You're so wrong.
I'm much more pathetic.

476
00:30:50,055 --> 00:30:52,528
I've got you beat.
I have pathetic down to a science.

477
00:30:53,217 --> 00:30:55,195
We haven't even covered high school.

478
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,062
Braces, "A" cup.

479
00:30:57,372 --> 00:30:59,315
Glasses, skin condition.

480
00:31:06,365 --> 00:31:07,365
You can...

481
00:31:08,981 --> 00:31:10,993
You know what?
I'm not gonna invite you in.

482
00:31:14,623 --> 00:31:16,457
Well, some other time then.

483
00:31:17,668 --> 00:31:19,543
Have a good night, Jenna.

484
00:31:31,263 --> 00:31:34,362
- So you found the boxes.
- I found this, too.

485
00:31:36,297 --> 00:31:37,447
Me and Logan.

486
00:31:39,418 --> 00:31:40,818
That's just cruel.

487
00:31:40,943 --> 00:31:42,733
Cruel is dating my history teacher.

488
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,351
I'm not dating him.

489
00:31:44,908 --> 00:31:45,908
Yet.

490
00:32:10,488 --> 00:32:12,179
This is why I feed on people.

491
00:32:18,178 --> 00:32:20,161
These people don't deserve this.

492
00:32:20,286 --> 00:32:22,886
They should never
have to know such evil.

493
00:32:23,213 --> 00:32:24,813
What do you mean evil?

494
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,294
I swear to God
I'll make you regret this.

495
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:29,530
I won't let you unleash them
into this world.

496
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:30,698
Them?

497
00:32:32,424 --> 00:32:34,515
What part of the story
did you lelee out?

498
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,746
- What does it matter?
- Emily, tell me what you did.

499
00:32:38,786 --> 00:32:39,886
To save her,

500
00:32:40,483 --> 00:32:41,709
I had to save them.

501
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:43,711
You saved everyone in the church?

502
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,130
- With one comes all.
- I don't care about that.

503
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:49,497
- I just want Katherine.
- I knew I shouldn't have believed

504
00:32:49,622 --> 00:32:52,929
a single word that comes out of your
mouth. This isn't about love, is it?

505
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,828
- This is about revenge.
- The two aren't mutually exclusive.

506
00:32:55,953 --> 00:32:57,867
- You can't do this.
- Why not?

507
00:32:57,992 --> 00:32:59,445
They killed 27 people,

508
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,181
and they called it a war battle.
They deserve whatever they get.

509
00:33:02,306 --> 00:33:05,250
27 vampires, Damon.
They were vampires.

510
00:33:05,375 --> 00:33:07,425
You can't just bring them back.

511
00:33:08,672 --> 00:33:10,230
This town deserves this.

512
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:14,102
You're blaming innocent people for
something that happened 145 years ago.

513
00:33:14,227 --> 00:33:17,286
There is nothing innocent about these
people, and don't think for a second

514
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:20,149
it won't happen again. They already
know too much, and they'll burn

515
00:33:20,274 --> 00:33:23,084
your little grandwitch right next
to us when they find out. Trust me.

516
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,853
Things are different now.

517
00:33:24,978 --> 00:33:27,378
- Don't do this.
- I can't free them.

518
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,714
I won't.

519
00:33:30,516 --> 00:33:31,516
Incendia!

520
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,608
She's alive, but barely.
I can save her.

521
00:34:42,901 --> 00:34:43,901
Her neck,

522
00:34:44,666 --> 00:34:45,791
it's healing.

523
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,214
- What are you doing here?
- Your window was open.

524
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:12,192
- I thought you should know
- Not funny.

525
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,212
Earlier today, I lied.

526
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,781
- About?
- About being in bed with you.

527
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,908
We cuddled and it creeped me out.

528
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,526
It creeped you out?

529
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:25,356
I mean, did you just come over
here to insult me or what?

530
00:35:25,481 --> 00:35:27,546
Because it's been
a really long night.

531
00:35:27,671 --> 00:35:29,921
It's just that... I don't like you.

532
00:35:30,715 --> 00:35:32,215
I never have, but...

533
00:35:33,052 --> 00:35:34,214
it was nice.

534
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:36,901
What?

535
00:35:37,026 --> 00:35:39,136
Being in bed with you, it felt nice.

536
00:35:39,483 --> 00:35:42,909
And so, I was thinking about it,
and I thought that I ould tell you

537
00:35:43,034 --> 00:35:44,587
I stayed the night because

538
00:35:44,712 --> 00:35:47,102
you were all sad and alone
and I felt bad for you.

539
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:52,316
Well, thank you,
cause I love being a charity case.

540
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,191
- You can leave now.
- No, because I know...

541
00:35:56,637 --> 00:35:58,324
With Vicki gone

542
00:35:58,449 --> 00:36:00,799
and my mom off with...
Pete whoever,

543
00:36:02,824 --> 00:36:03,974
it's just me,

544
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:06,228
so...

545
00:36:06,816 --> 00:36:07,816
I know.

546
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:31,385
Katherine never compelled me.
I knew everything

547
00:36:32,073 --> 00:36:33,673
every step of the way.

548
00:36:40,842 --> 00:36:42,292
It was real for me.

549
00:36:49,116 --> 00:36:50,366
I'll leave now.

550
00:36:54,731 --> 00:36:57,444
I don't understand, Elena,
what happened to me.

551
00:36:57,569 --> 00:36:59,169
He attacked me, and...

552
00:36:59,294 --> 00:37:00,794
his face was like...

553
00:37:01,108 --> 00:37:03,158
How do you feel?
Are you okay?

554
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:04,888
I'm fine.

555
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:07,206
It's just this blood. I don't...

556
00:37:12,062 --> 00:37:13,712
I'm not gonna hurt you.

557
00:37:15,171 --> 00:37:17,971
- What's going on?
- I'll explain everything.

558
00:37:18,288 --> 00:37:20,028
Okay? Let's just get out of here.

559
00:37:24,535 --> 00:37:26,085
Look at me. Trust me.

560
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,078
He's not going to hurt you.

561
00:37:29,246 --> 00:37:30,646
Come on.
Come on.

562
00:37:43,005 --> 00:37:45,055
Is she in danger of becoming...

563
00:37:45,766 --> 00:37:48,223
No, she has to die with
my blood in her system,

564
00:37:48,652 --> 00:37:51,822
so keep an eye on her tonight and
make sure that nothing happens and

565
00:37:51,947 --> 00:37:54,178
once it leaves her system,
she'll be fine.

566
00:37:55,203 --> 00:37:57,153
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

567
00:38:00,014 --> 00:38:01,014
You sure?

568
00:38:02,939 --> 00:38:04,239
I can trust her.

569
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:06,074
I need someone to know,

570
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,452
someone to talk to.
I can't live in secret.

571
00:38:08,782 --> 00:38:09,882
I know that.

572
00:38:10,592 --> 00:38:11,992
Shouldn't have to.

573
00:38:15,222 --> 00:38:16,672
You saved her life.

574
00:38:21,266 --> 00:38:23,616
I'm sorry, Stefan.
I thought that...

575
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,250
I couldn't be with you, but I can.

576
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,771
You don't have to push me away.

577
00:38:30,522 --> 00:38:31,722
I can do this.

578
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:38,987
I can't.

579
00:38:44,012 --> 00:38:45,312
I have to leave.

580
00:38:46,678 --> 00:38:49,678
Too many people have died.
Too much has happened.

581
00:38:49,938 --> 00:38:50,938
What?

582
00:38:51,393 --> 00:38:53,249
No. I know you think

583
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:56,022
- you're protecting me, but...
- I have to.

584
00:38:56,147 --> 00:38:57,921
Coming home was...

585
00:38:59,594 --> 00:39:00,754
It was a mistake.

586
00:39:01,521 --> 00:39:04,021
I can't be a part of
your life anymore.

587
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:06,051
Don't go, Stefan.

588
00:39:07,485 --> 00:39:08,485
Please...

589
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:11,247
You don't have to.
This is your home.

590
00:39:11,466 --> 00:39:12,766
Please don't go.

591
00:39:20,485 --> 00:39:21,785
Good-Bye, Elena.

592
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:25,529
You're just gonna walk away?

593
00:39:26,551 --> 00:39:28,251
Don't walk away, Stefan!

594
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:32,340
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

595
00:41:37,772 --> 00:41:41,522
Croutch, Haize, Humanidyne,
McFly, MiniBen314, Thirteen, WoLF971
