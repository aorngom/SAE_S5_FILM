1
00:01:08,322 --> 00:01:10,056
Nice car.

2
00:01:10,057 --> 00:01:12,392
I thought it was a waste

3
00:01:12,393 --> 00:01:13,760
To leave it sitting in the garage.

4
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:18,632
I didn't kno you were
coming back today.

5
00:01:18,633 --> 00:01:20,967
You know, I woke up this morning

6
00:01:20,968 --> 00:01:22,636
And I was feeling great,

7
00:01:22,637 --> 00:01:26,306
And I figured it was time for
me to get back into things.

8
00:01:26,307 --> 00:01:28,842
Does the mean you're ok now?

9
00:01:28,843 --> 00:01:31,278
With all the cravings?

10
00:01:31,279 --> 00:01:33,346
Yeah. I mean,
the worst part is over.

11
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:35,282
So...now all I want to do

12
00:01:35,283 --> 00:01:39,352
Is just spend as much
time with you as possible.

13
00:01:39,353 --> 00:01:41,921
I'm ok with that.

14
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,991
Hey, thank you.

15
00:01:44,992 --> 00:01:47,627
For helping me get through the--

16
00:01:47,628 --> 00:01:49,629
The rough patch.

17
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,931
You're welcome.

18
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,434
We're going to be late.

19
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:55,769
Ok, um, you know what,

20
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,305
I'll catch up with you.
I'm gonna grab my stuff.

21
00:01:58,306 --> 00:01:59,306
I'll be right behind you.

22
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:01,107
Ok. Ok.

23
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:27,000
There was a disturbance at the
hospital blood bank last night.

24
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:28,668
Some of the supply
was compromised.

25
00:02:28,669 --> 00:02:31,671
Compromised? You mean stolen.

26
00:02:31,672 --> 00:02:33,506
We almost missed it.

27
00:02:33,507 --> 00:02:35,308
The inventory records
were altered,

28
00:02:35,309 --> 00:02:36,976
But when the night
manager was questioned,

29
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:39,079
He had no recollection
of changing them.

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,647
Meaning the vampire
who stole the blood

31
00:02:40,648 --> 00:02:42,482
Used mind control
to hide the theft.

32
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:43,703
I know what she meant.

33
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:45,752
We wouldn't have noticed
if John not alerted us

34
00:02:45,753 --> 00:02:46,986
To recent discrepancies

35
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:48,788
At other hospital blood
banks in the county.

36
00:02:48,789 --> 00:02:51,626
How lucky for us, we have John.

37
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:53,124
We're stepping up
security at the hospital,

38
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,351
Giving the guards vervain

39
00:02:54,352 --> 00:02:56,229
To prevent this from
happening again.

40
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:58,064
Sheriff, might I
offer a suggestion?

41
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:00,723
Why don't Damon and I
put our heads together?

42
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:02,374
We can track down
whoever's doing this.

43
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,209
Truthfully, I could
use the extra hands.

44
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,581
Is that something you'd
be willing to do?

45
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:09,783
Well, of course, I mean,
if it'll help.

46
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:11,284
I think we'll make a good team.

47
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:13,553
Don't you, Damon?

48
00:03:13,554 --> 00:03:15,855
John, whatever I can do to
help keep this town safe,

49
00:03:15,856 --> 00:03:18,725
Even if it means
spending time with you.

50
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:25,865
Ok.

51
00:03:25,866 --> 00:03:27,567
This week we're going
to set aside our

52
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:30,170
Regular curriculum for a
lesson in local history

53
00:03:30,171 --> 00:03:31,838
As we approach founder's day.

54
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,007
Apparently the community leaders

55
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:35,275
Feel that's more important
than world war ii,

56
00:03:35,276 --> 00:03:37,010
But hey, what do I know?

57
00:03:37,011 --> 00:03:39,312
Sorry I'm late.

58
00:03:39,313 --> 00:03:40,680
Looks like we will be
at full occupancy today.

59
00:03:40,681 --> 00:03:43,516
Welcome home, Bonnie.

60
00:03:43,517 --> 00:03:45,051
Right, founder's day.

61
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:47,153
What does it mean to
have a founder's day?

62
00:03:47,154 --> 00:03:50,223
Well, if you'll turn
your attention to this

63
00:03:50,224 --> 00:03:51,691
Exquisite diorama over here

64
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,159
That I spent all night...

65
00:03:56,964 --> 00:03:58,698
I suppose I should be grateful

66
00:03:58,699 --> 00:03:59,966
You learned how to use the bell.

67
00:03:59,967 --> 00:04:01,869
I'm here on behalf of my mother.

68
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,071
On behalf of or in spite of?

69
00:04:05,072 --> 00:04:07,607
I'm sorry about what the
other vampires did to Stefan.

70
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:09,279
Abducting him, torturing him.

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,614
It wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

72
00:04:10,615 --> 00:04:13,083
You were playing house
with half of a tomb

73
00:04:13,084 --> 00:04:14,518
Of really pissed off vampires.

74
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:16,286
What did you think
was going to happen?

75
00:04:16,287 --> 00:04:19,389
My mom is devastated.
They tried to overthrow her.

76
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,491
Why isn't she here
telling me this?

77
00:04:21,492 --> 00:04:23,160
She doesn't really do apologies.

78
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:24,127
Well, that's a coincidence,

79
00:04:24,128 --> 00:04:25,228
'cause I don'to forgiveness,

80
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,229
So just run along.

81
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,430
And if you're going to continue

82
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:29,132
Playing house with your
little vampire pets,

83
00:04:29,133 --> 00:04:31,434
You might want to stop
robbing the blood bank dry,

84
00:04:31,435 --> 00:04:33,570
Because they're onto it.

85
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:36,873
I haven't been to the local
blood bank in at least a week.

86
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:38,241
Then it's one of your others.

87
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:39,543
The other ones are gone, Damon.

88
00:04:39,544 --> 00:04:41,444
Well, where'd they go?

89
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:42,879
They weren't cut
out for this town.

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,080
After what happened
with your brother,

91
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:45,282
My mom kicked them out
and they took off.

92
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,951
It's just us and Harper now.

93
00:04:50,621 --> 00:04:51,922
Bonnie.

94
00:04:51,923 --> 00:04:54,124
Hey.

95
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:57,427
Hey, I, um, I tried to
grab you after class

96
00:04:57,428 --> 00:04:59,329
But you'd already taken off.

97
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,698
How are you? How's your family?

98
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,234
We're dealing. It's been hard.

99
00:05:04,235 --> 00:05:06,473
Everyone here really missed you.

100
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,578
Yeah, I just had so
much to deal with

101
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:09,685
After grams' funeral,

102
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:12,605
And honestly after you told me
that the tomb's spell failed,

103
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,377
I just didn't really
want to come back.

104
00:05:14,378 --> 00:05:16,479
I hope you understand
why I called.

105
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,882
I wanted you to know
before you came home.

106
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,718
Yeah, I understand why.
I just wish I didn't know.

107
00:05:23,554 --> 00:05:25,188
I know it's been really hard--

108
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:26,289
Bonnie!

109
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,259
Bonnie! Thank God you're home!

110
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,428
I know we talked every day,
but I missed you!

111
00:05:31,429 --> 00:05:32,796
How are you doing?

112
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:34,631
Better. Just better. You know,

113
00:05:34,632 --> 00:05:36,032
Just glad to be back,

114
00:05:36,033 --> 00:05:37,801
And try to keep myself busy.

115
00:05:37,802 --> 00:05:39,035
Well, I can help with that.

116
00:05:39,036 --> 00:05:42,138
Major wardrobe confab needed asap.

117
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,340
You need to help me
pick the perfect dress

118
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:46,109
For the founder's court. Oh.

119
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:48,345
The founder's court?
Did I miss something?

120
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,981
The founder's court.

121
00:05:50,982 --> 00:05:53,984
You know, miss mystic falls.

122
00:05:53,985 --> 00:05:56,186
They announced it today, and, um,

123
00:05:56,187 --> 00:05:57,887
You and are both on it.

124
00:05:57,888 --> 00:05:59,122
Oh, my God, we signed
up for that so long ago.

125
00:05:59,123 --> 00:06:00,924
I completely forgot.

126
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,158
Yeah.

127
00:06:02,159 --> 00:06:03,994
So are you dropping out, then?

128
00:06:06,264 --> 00:06:09,266
I can't.

129
00:06:09,267 --> 00:06:10,834
No?

130
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:13,703
Her mom is the one who
wanted her to enter.

131
00:06:20,978 --> 00:06:22,746
How was school?

132
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:25,482
Fine.

133
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:27,317
Yeah? Same old, same old?

134
00:06:27,318 --> 00:06:29,386
Nothing new?

135
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:31,187
No stories to bring home?

136
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,591
You're making small talk, why?

137
00:06:34,592 --> 00:06:36,526
You seem awfully chipper lately.

138
00:06:36,527 --> 00:06:39,429
Less doom and gloom,
a little more pep in your step.

139
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,765
And you think it's because
I drank human blood again.

140
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:43,967
I mean, I don't want to brag,

141
00:06:43,968 --> 00:06:46,303
But I would definitely
take responsibility

142
00:06:46,304 --> 00:06:48,238
For this new and improved you.

143
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:50,240
Right, right. Well,
I hate to burst your bubble,

144
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,541
But I'm clean.

145
00:06:51,542 --> 00:06:53,743
Yeah, not possible.

146
00:06:53,744 --> 00:06:56,880
Not only is it possible,
but it is quite true.

147
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:59,949
Stefan, let's be
serious for a second.

148
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,619
You spent the last
century and a half

149
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,488
Being a poster child for Prozac,

150
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:08,091
And now you expect me to
believe that this new you

151
00:07:08,092 --> 00:07:11,294
Has nothing to do with
human blood, nothing.

152
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:15,098
I'm clean.

153
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:16,966
You're lying!

154
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,903
Believe what you want.

155
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:26,776
I'm sorry for the short notice.

156
00:07:26,777 --> 00:07:28,812
I didn't even know that
the contest was coming up,

157
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:30,313
Much less that I would be in it.

158
00:07:30,314 --> 00:07:32,449
Well, I'll be happy to
escort you anywhere.

159
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,218
My mom was really into
this founder's day stuff.

160
00:07:35,219 --> 00:07:37,253
She was even miss
mystic in her day.

161
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:39,622
I kinda wanted to do it for her.

162
00:07:39,623 --> 00:07:41,391
Well, it'll be great.

163
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:42,959
We'll have fun.

164
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,495
Ok. I'll see tomorrow. I love you.

165
00:07:45,496 --> 00:07:46,830
Love you, too.

166
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,492
Well, well.

167
00:08:15,493 --> 00:08:17,560
He's a liar and a thief.

168
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:28,197
So...

169
00:08:28,198 --> 00:08:30,466
When were you going to share?

170
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,802
Go ahead.

171
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:34,080
Help yourself.
No, no, I'm talking about

172
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36,606
The fact that you're
a closet blood nknk.

173
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,474
So I'm drinking blood again.

174
00:08:38,475 --> 00:08:40,076
You're the one that
shoved it on me.

175
00:08:40,077 --> 00:08:42,278
What's your problem?

176
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,981
I have it under control.
Under control?

177
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,283
You robbed the hospital.

178
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:48,951
So what's your point?

179
00:08:48,952 --> 00:08:51,721
Fine. Whatever, man. Drink up.

180
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:54,323
Just remember we're trying
to keep a low profile.

181
00:08:54,324 --> 00:08:55,625
Why don't you just walk up

182
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:57,260
To sheriff Forbes,
ask her to tap a vein.

183
00:08:57,261 --> 00:09:00,396
Have my actions
negatively impacted you?

184
00:09:00,397 --> 00:09:03,299
Ooh. I can't imagine
what that must feel like.

185
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:06,636
Yeah, what's Elena think
about the new...you?

186
00:09:06,637 --> 00:09:09,372
Noing's changed.
I'm still the same person.

187
00:09:09,373 --> 00:09:10,706
Clearly.

188
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:12,909
Elena doesn't need
to know anything yet.

189
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:17,413
You've been off the human
stuff for years, Stefan.

190
00:09:17,414 --> 00:09:18,581
If you're having
trouble controlling--

191
00:09:18,582 --> 00:09:19,682
I'm not having any trouble.

192
00:09:19,683 --> 00:09:21,217
Who do you think
you're talking to?

193
00:09:21,218 --> 00:09:22,852
I know what it's like.

194
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:24,387
That Jekyll and Hyde feeling.

195
00:09:24,388 --> 00:09:26,422
There's that switch,
sometimes it goes off and you snap.

196
00:09:26,423 --> 00:09:28,069
Right now is not a
good time for me

197
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,959
To be worried about you snapping.

198
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:33,195
I know that it pains
you to see this.

199
00:09:33,196 --> 00:09:34,196
Hmm.

200
00:09:34,197 --> 00:09:37,033
But I'm fine, ok?

201
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,768
I'm fine.

202
00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:40,102
So please,

203
00:09:40,103 --> 00:09:41,971
Do me a favor.

204
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,075
And back off.

205
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,515
This year's queen will have

206
00:09:52,516 --> 00:09:54,335
The special honor of
taking center stage

207
00:09:54,336 --> 00:09:56,719
AT THE 150th FOUNDER'S DAY GALA.

208
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,254
Before we crown our winner,

209
00:09:58,255 --> 00:09:59,455
We'd like to get to know

210
00:09:59,456 --> 00:10:01,057
A bit more about each of you.

211
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,959
I'm on the m.F.
Beautification committee.

212
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,994
I volunteer at the rec
center soup kitchen.

213
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,929
I recognize that I haven't
been as involved this year

214
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:08,194
As I used to be.

215
00:10:08,195 --> 00:10:11,028
I implemented this year's
go green campaign at school.

216
00:10:11,029 --> 00:10:13,624
I've been distracted,
and I let a lot of things slide.

217
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:15,893
I don't think it's wrong for
me to win 2 years in a row.

218
00:10:15,894 --> 00:10:17,561
I was surprised to
have been selected.

219
00:10:17,562 --> 00:10:19,897
Since I'm not from one
of the founding families.

220
00:10:19,898 --> 00:10:21,165
But I'm aware of what
an honor this is,

221
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:23,500
And I want you to know
that I take it seriously.

222
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:25,302
Worked with the county's
recycling program

223
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:27,671
And was in charge of the
policemen's yearly raffle.

224
00:10:27,672 --> 00:10:30,243
Just because my DUI made my
community service mandatory,

225
00:10:30,244 --> 00:10:31,660
Doesn't mean I was
any less committed.

226
00:10:31,661 --> 00:10:34,593
This was really
important to my mother.

227
00:10:34,594 --> 00:10:36,547
She believed in community,

228
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:39,016
Family, honor and loyalty.

229
00:10:40,185 --> 00:10:42,519
It's the legacy e e ft for me.

230
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,143
Hey, partner.

231
00:10:47,144 --> 00:10:48,054
What do you want?

232
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:50,327
You haven't returned
any of my calls.

233
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:52,529
Most people take that as a hint.

234
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,299
Why don't we start
looking for vampires?

235
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,667
Why the act, John?

236
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:59,216
I mean, you obviously don't
care about catching vampires.

237
00:10:59,217 --> 00:11:00,304
You're here talking to me.

238
00:11:00,305 --> 00:11:01,905
Actually, I care very much.

239
00:11:01,906 --> 00:11:02,940
What did Isobel say about that?

240
00:11:02,941 --> 00:11:05,242
I mean, considering
that she is one.

241
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:09,246
Isobel and I share
a mutual interest.

242
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:11,315
The originalJohnathan
Gilbert had an invention

243
00:11:11,316 --> 00:11:13,417
That was stolen by a vampire.

244
00:11:13,418 --> 00:11:15,219
That vampire was then burned alive

245
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:17,654
In fell's church,
or soJohnathan thought.

246
00:11:17,655 --> 00:11:19,330
And the invention
was lost forever.

247
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:20,597
Hmm.

248
00:11:20,598 --> 00:11:23,700
But then the vampires
weren't killed, were they?

249
00:11:23,701 --> 00:11:26,269
They were trapped.

250
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,670
And now they're free,
thanks to you,

251
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:29,472
Which means the invention
is retrievable.

252
00:11:29,473 --> 00:11:31,374
Well, what is it?

253
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,376
The only thing that matters
is that I want it back,

254
00:11:33,377 --> 00:11:36,279
And you're going to help me
if you want your secret safe.

255
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,681
I mean, why bring
me into it, John?

256
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:40,216
I mean, I don't even know
what you're talking about,

257
00:11:40,217 --> 00:11:41,284
Much less who has it.

258
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,919
Oh, come on, Damon.

259
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,487
You were around back then.

260
00:11:44,488 --> 00:11:47,991
Yoknow who these people are,
what they look like.

261
00:11:47,992 --> 00:11:49,592
He was friendly with a woman

262
00:11:49,593 --> 00:11:50,994
Who turned out to be a vampire.

263
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,362
Her name was pearl.

264
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:54,898
Does that ring a bell?

265
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:02,839
I'm not playing anymore.

266
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,007
Get out.

267
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:05,608
Get out.

268
00:12:05,609 --> 00:12:07,043
I beg your pardon?

269
00:12:07,044 --> 00:12:08,166
You know, I only entertain

270
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:10,084
This whole blackmail
scheme thing of yours

271
00:12:10,085 --> 00:12:12,486
Because I thought that you and
Isobel could lead me to Katherine.

272
00:12:12,487 --> 00:12:15,155
But see, now I know you have
no idea where Katherine is,

273
00:12:15,156 --> 00:12:17,591
Because if you did, you would know

274
00:12:17,592 --> 00:12:19,093
That Katherine and pearl

275
00:12:19,094 --> 00:12:20,995
Were best friends.

276
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:23,717
See, you don't know everything,

277
00:12:23,718 --> 00:12:25,719
Do you, John?

278
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:30,047
I'll tell the entire
council what you are.

279
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,815
Go for it. I'll kill
every last one of them.

280
00:12:32,816 --> 00:12:34,884
Then I'll sever your hand,
pull your ring off,

281
00:12:34,885 --> 00:12:36,686
And I'll kill you, too.

282
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:38,921
Do you understand that?

283
00:12:40,657 --> 00:12:43,259
Honor your partner.

284
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:50,233
Let's focus. Right hand around.

285
00:12:51,969 --> 00:12:54,570
Flirt with your eyes.

286
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:01,444
Left hand around.

287
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:07,617
This is ridiculous.

288
00:13:07,618 --> 00:13:09,986
Both hands.
You're only saying that

289
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:11,187
Because you don't
know how to do it.

290
00:13:11,188 --> 00:13:13,289
Sorry only one of us was around

291
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,724
When the dance was invented.

292
00:13:14,725 --> 00:13:16,225
Ouch! Oooh!

293
00:13:16,226 --> 00:13:18,861
Oh, no, no, no, no.

294
00:13:18,862 --> 00:13:20,396
There's no touching
during this part.

295
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:23,633
It's about the simple
intimacy of the near-touch.

296
00:13:23,634 --> 00:13:24,700
Very nice, Amber.

297
00:13:24,701 --> 00:13:26,235
Thank you, Mrs. Lockwood!

298
00:13:26,236 --> 00:13:30,940
If you ask me,
the near touch is overrated.

299
00:13:30,941 --> 00:13:33,543
You seem to be in a good mood.

300
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:34,911
Is that a bad thing?

301
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:37,213
Would you prefer me to
be brooding and tortured?

302
00:13:37,214 --> 00:13:38,581
Hey, I'm not complaining.

303
00:13:38,582 --> 00:13:40,817
Oh, no touching.

304
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:45,388
The fell cousins
don't have a shot.

305
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:47,223
And Amber Bradley
is only on the court

306
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:49,959
So the pageant doesn't look like
it's founding families only.

307
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,260
Which, of course, it is.

308
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:52,862
So that leaves Elena.

309
00:13:52,863 --> 00:13:55,465
She totally has the sympathy
vote since her parents died.

310
00:13:55,466 --> 00:13:57,200
How can I compete with that?

311
00:13:57,201 --> 00:13:59,135
Very nice.

312
00:13:59,136 --> 00:14:00,169
Very sensitive.

313
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:01,504
Oh, I'm sorry. This must sound

314
00:14:01,505 --> 00:14:03,840
Really unimportant in
light of everything.

315
00:14:03,841 --> 00:14:05,575
It's ok. I get it.

316
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:07,276
You want to win.

317
00:14:07,277 --> 00:14:09,612
Well, my grandmother
was miss mystic.

318
00:14:09,613 --> 00:14:11,080
And both of my aunts.

319
00:14:11,081 --> 00:14:13,349
My mom's the only one
who didn't get the gene,

320
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,284
And I want this.

321
00:14:15,285 --> 00:14:17,153
I mean, I actually deserve this.

322
00:14:24,328 --> 00:14:25,595
Bonnie.

323
00:14:25,596 --> 00:14:28,130
Hey. Hey.

324
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:30,500
How are you?

325
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,172
I begged Bonnie to
fill in for Matt.

326
00:14:36,173 --> 00:14:38,274
He had to work today.

327
00:14:41,044 --> 00:14:42,645
Bonnie, do you have a minute?

328
00:14:43,814 --> 00:14:46,549
We only have 30
minutes for rehearsal.

329
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,017
It'll only take a minute.

330
00:14:48,018 --> 00:14:50,486
Please?

331
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:05,501
Bonnie, you have to
tell me what's wrong.

332
00:15:05,502 --> 00:15:07,303
It's not worth talking about.

333
00:15:07,304 --> 00:15:09,572
What do you mean, not worth it?

334
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:12,174
You've barely said 10 words to me,

335
00:15:12,175 --> 00:15:14,210
And you won't even look at Stefan.

336
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,014
Is that what it is, is it Stefan?

337
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:23,019
Listen.

338
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,488
Elena, I can't just pretend

339
00:15:25,489 --> 00:15:27,156
Like everything is ok.

340
00:15:27,157 --> 00:15:29,425
Everything my grams
did was to protect us

341
00:15:29,426 --> 00:15:31,827
From those vampires in the tomb.

342
00:15:31,828 --> 00:15:35,898
And now they're out,
which means she died for nothing.

343
00:15:38,502 --> 00:15:42,471
I'm so sorry, Bonnie.

344
00:15:42,472 --> 00:15:44,840
What can I do to make it better?

345
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:46,208
That's just it.

346
00:15:46,209 --> 00:15:48,044
There's nothing you can do.

347
00:15:48,045 --> 00:15:51,581
I blame him, Elena.

348
00:15:51,582 --> 00:15:52,815
Him and Damon.

349
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,483
And I'm not going to
put you in a situation

350
00:15:54,484 --> 00:15:56,953
Where you have to choose sides.

351
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:00,523
I'm just having a
hard time with it.

352
00:16:00,524 --> 00:16:02,758
Ok?

353
00:16:19,176 --> 00:16:21,844
Dude, are you ok? You're bleeding.

354
00:16:31,121 --> 00:16:34,457
Ahh, Stefan!

355
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,058
Are you ok?

356
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:37,927
Yes. I'm sorry.

357
00:16:39,696 --> 00:16:40,730
I was just...

358
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:43,032
I was feeling a little sick.

359
00:16:43,033 --> 00:16:44,934
I'll be fine.

360
00:16:58,112 --> 00:16:59,279
Hey. Hi.

361
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,314
I heard you're driving.
Yeah, I am.

362
00:17:01,315 --> 00:17:02,482
Let me get that for you.

363
00:17:02,483 --> 00:17:03,884
Thanks.

364
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:05,018
Yeah.

365
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:06,586
Um, how, uh--

366
00:17:06,587 --> 00:17:08,922
How is Stefan?

367
00:17:08,923 --> 00:17:11,224
What do you mean?

368
00:17:11,225 --> 00:17:13,427
You know, he seems on edge.

369
00:17:13,428 --> 00:17:14,961
He went through a lot,

370
00:17:14,962 --> 00:17:16,797
He was in bad shape for a while.

371
00:17:16,798 --> 00:17:18,331
But he's bouncing back now.

372
00:17:19,734 --> 00:17:21,067
Alaric.

373
00:17:21,068 --> 00:17:24,337
Hey, buddy.
What are you doing here?

374
00:17:24,338 --> 00:17:26,373
Well, I'm the chauffer.

375
00:17:26,374 --> 00:17:27,808
Oh, I thought I was driving.

376
00:17:27,809 --> 00:17:29,810
Oh, no need.

377
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:31,445
We're going with Rick.

378
00:17:33,381 --> 00:17:35,148
Are we ready?

379
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:36,450
Jeremy can ride with you.

380
00:17:57,472 --> 00:18:00,140
In the running for
miss mystic falls?

381
00:18:00,141 --> 00:18:03,677
Somememis you have to wear
uncomfortable heels to blend in.

382
00:18:05,179 --> 00:18:08,715
I remember this event from 1864.

383
00:18:08,716 --> 00:18:11,218
I was supposed to enter,

384
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,986
Before everything happened.

385
00:18:12,987 --> 00:18:15,922
Ahh, nostalgia's a bitch.

386
00:18:15,923 --> 00:18:17,858
If you're just going to mock me,

387
00:18:17,859 --> 00:18:20,093
Then you move along, please.

388
00:18:20,094 --> 00:18:23,029
John Gilbert thinks your
mom stole an artifact

389
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:27,234
FromJohnathan sr.
Sr. Back in 1864.

390
00:18:27,235 --> 00:18:29,319
What are you, his errand boy?

391
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,021
I don't know what it is,

392
00:18:31,022 --> 00:18:32,655
But I don't want him to have it.

393
00:18:32,656 --> 00:18:33,775
I could ask her.

394
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:35,335
But, you know,
you've made it pretty clear

395
00:18:35,336 --> 00:18:36,670
That you don't trust us,

396
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,338
So why should I even bother?

397
00:18:38,339 --> 00:18:39,940
Because you want to
stay in mystic falls,

398
00:18:39,941 --> 00:18:41,875
And John Gilbert's in town,
making that impossible.

399
00:18:43,044 --> 00:18:44,244
Find out where it is.

400
00:18:44,245 --> 00:18:47,448
He leaves, you can
buy a welcome mat.

401
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:53,220
Thanks for helping me.

402
00:18:53,221 --> 00:18:54,688
Don't thank me

403
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:56,824
Until you're sure your hair
isn't going to burn off.

404
00:18:58,426 --> 00:18:59,760
You know, I remember

405
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:02,262
When my mom and I were
first applying for this.

406
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:04,364
She was so excited.

407
00:19:04,365 --> 00:19:06,767
So were you, if I recall.

408
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:08,335
I was.

409
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:10,871
She just made it sound
like so much fun.

410
00:19:10,872 --> 00:19:12,906
Lots has changed since then.

411
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,908
Well, I hate to break it to you,

412
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:16,643
But it's a little
late for cold feet.

413
00:19:16,644 --> 00:19:19,580
I don't have cold feet. I just...

414
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:22,249
I think I'd be enjoying it
a lot more if she was here.

415
00:19:26,588 --> 00:19:27,855
I'll tell you one thing,

416
00:19:27,856 --> 00:19:30,457
Your hair would have a
better chance if she was.

417
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:35,896
Ok, I should go put my dress on.

418
00:19:35,897 --> 00:19:37,931
Be careful with that thing.

419
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:39,700
Don't hurt anybody.

420
00:19:43,872 --> 00:19:46,273
You look miserable.

421
00:19:47,475 --> 00:19:49,176
Are there really a whole
month of these events

422
00:19:49,177 --> 00:19:50,711
That I'm supposed to show up at?

423
00:19:50,712 --> 00:19:52,579
You can fight it if you want,

424
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,715
But it's part of being a Gilbert.

425
00:19:54,716 --> 00:19:57,985
Yeah, you, uh, you mentioned you
know a lot about the family.

426
00:19:57,986 --> 00:20:01,288
Do you know anything about our
ancestorJohnathan Gilbert?

427
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:04,470
Prolific writer, crazy inventor.

428
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:05,500
Why do you ask?

429
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,050
Well, I read his journal.

430
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,360
Is that right?

431
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,710
Yeah.

432
00:20:10,711 --> 00:20:13,310
I actually found it
in all dad's stuff.

433
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,110
Well, that's surprising.

434
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,750
Most of them are locked away.

435
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:19,059
There's more of them?

436
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,940
Johnathan Gilbert
journaled his whole life.

437
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,230
Right down to the bitter,
insane drunken end.

438
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,080
Guy had a lot of demons.

439
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,370
And did you read 'em?

440
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,100
I browsed, yeah.

441
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,700
What'd you think
about what he wrote?

442
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,730
Crazy ramblings of a mad man,
of course.

443
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,460
Well, she's very pretty.

444
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,260
Yeah, yeah, she's a, uh,

445
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,430
A friend of mine. Excuse me.

446
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,990
Are you ok, Amber?

447
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,450
I hate being the
center of attention.

448
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,340
I get panic attacks.

449
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,500
Do you need some privacy
so you can change?

450
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,130
Actually, I'm just-
I'm just going to go get some air.

451
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,429
You can't be back here.

452
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,320
We need to talk.

453
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,280
Does it have to be right now?

454
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,050
Normally I would have a
completely different outlook

455
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,259
On what I'm about to tell you,

456
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,110
But since it could
really inconvenience me,

457
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,340
I'll squeal.

458
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,190
What are you talking about?

459
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:39,010
Stefan's still
drinking human blood.

460
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,140
What? Yeah.

461
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,290
A month ago,
I would have rejoiced.

462
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,460
But with the council
back on the alert,

463
00:21:48,461 --> 00:21:51,379
It is not a good time for
Stefan to fly off the handle.

464
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,739
I know he's been a little edgy,

465
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,130
But he said that was normal.

466
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:57,349
He has a fridge full of
stolen blood bank contraband

467
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,380
In the house.

468
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,599
Oh, my God.

469
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,559
He has no idea what normal is.

470
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,570
His entire existence isn't normal.

471
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,720
Normal to a vampire is
drinking human blood.

472
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:11,690
But he spent all
this time fighting it

473
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,810
When he should have been
learning how to control it.

474
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,520
And now it's controlling
him instead.

475
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,399
I can't believe this.

476
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,410
I mean, it's Stefan that
we're talking about here.

477
00:22:19,411 --> 00:22:21,049
Stefan on human blood, Elena.

478
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,510
He'll do anything,
he'll say anything,

479
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,550
Because he's not going
to want to stop.

480
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,630
Trust me.

481
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:31,610
Anna!

482
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,020
What is it?

483
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,240
Come on, don't be like that.

484
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,180
Why not?

485
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,839
You're basically using me
to turn you into a vampire

486
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,179
So you could be with someone else.

487
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:45,540
No, I wasn't using you.

488
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,100
Really?

489
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,620
Then how would you
like to define it?

490
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,849
Look, I don't think it's any worse

491
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:52,129
Than becoming friends with me

492
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:53,790
So you could give
your mother my blood.

493
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:56,670
How do you know that?

494
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,980
That's not important.

495
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,990
Seriously, Jeremy.

496
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,370
What do you know?

497
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:05,060
Everything. I know everything.

498
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:09,870
This is all my fault.

499
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:12,860
I'm the one who fed him the
blood in the first place.

500
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,400
What's going on in here?

501
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,429
Just filling Elena in

502
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,030
On your extracurricular
activities.

503
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:29,790
What are you talking about?

504
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:31,630
I know about the blood, Stefan.

505
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,699
I'm gonna-- I'll be downstairs,

506
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,410
Drinking.

507
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:49,810
I was going to tell you.

508
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:50,920
When?

509
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:53,690
I'm fine.

510
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:57,260
I'm fine. The blood,
it doesn't change anything.

511
00:23:58,630 --> 00:23:59,969
It's changing you.

512
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:01,680
Why, because I kept
it a secret from you?

513
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,719
Come on, Elena.

514
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,699
Look, given the way that
you're reacting right now,

515
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,560
Can you really blame
me for doing that?

516
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,020
Are you hearing
yourself right now?

517
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,010
You've been stealing
blood and lying,

518
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,230
And you say that
everything's fine?

519
00:24:14,231 --> 00:24:15,890
Everything's not fine, Stefan.

520
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,509
So what, so you and Damon

521
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,250
All of a sudden have
everythgg figured out then?

522
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,580
It's not about Damon.

523
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,409
It's about what's
happening to you.

524
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:24,320
I know, and I'm telling
you that I'm fine.

525
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:25,730
I'm fine.

526
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,060
Please, come on.

527
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,410
Elena, I thought you...

528
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:31,800
I thought you believed in me.

529
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:35,250
Elena? Let's go.
The line up's starting.

530
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,609
I just--

531
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:38,370
I need a minute.

532
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,830
You're not even dressed yet.

533
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,690
Escorts wait downstairs, Stefan.

534
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,520
God!

535
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,440
Oh, God, sorry!

536
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,280
Ms. Tina fell,

537
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,070
Escorted by bartholomew Whitmore.

538
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:24,620
Has anyone seen Amber?

539
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:28,370
Do you see Stefan down there?

540
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:31,960
Nope.

541
00:25:31,961 --> 00:25:34,100
Just my boring fill-in escort.

542
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,380
What happened to Matt?

543
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:37,080
They wouldn't let him out of work.

544
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,350
Hey, what happened to Stefan?

545
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,409
I don't know. He just
disappeared somewhere.

546
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,070
I don't know.

547
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,800
What am I doing?

548
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:45,130
I never should have
gone through with this.

549
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,970
What do you mean?
I need to find Stefan.

550
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:50,240
This isn't me.
I'm not this person anymore.

551
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,780
Uh, no, no, no, no way, no.

552
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,080
You had your chance to drop out.

553
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,930
And believe me, I was all for it.

554
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:58,510
Because there is no way
that I can beat you.

555
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,600
Elena, you're doing this because
it was important to your mom.

556
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,740
Ms. Caroline Forbes,

557
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,920
And her escort Jeffrey
lockwood Hamilton.

558
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,610
Elena, you're next. Come on.

559
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:29,640
You're missing
Elena's introduction.

560
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,990
I don't care.

561
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,590
So she has no idea
you read her journal?

562
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:34,929
She keeps things from me,

563
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,260
I'm going to keep things from her.

564
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,510
What are you going to do now?

565
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,480
Now that you know everything
that she's been hiding from you?

566
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:43,320
I don't know.

567
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,569
There's a part of me
that's so angry, you know,

568
00:26:47,570 --> 00:26:48,910
That she covered up
what happened to vickie

569
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,670
And erased my memory,

570
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,240
But there's this other
part of me that's glad.

571
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,830
I--

572
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,620
I don't want to remember
vickie like that.

573
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,130
As a monster?

574
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,890
No, as someone who
wanted to hurt me.

575
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,390
When I met you,

576
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,450
You were just a part of my
plan to get my mother back.

577
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,910
But then things changed.

578
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,180
All the time we spent together.

579
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,640
I would never do anything
to hurt you. Not now.

580
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:22,990
You know that, right?

581
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,180
Yeah, I know that.

582
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,589
Where are we going?

583
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,250
I don't know.

584
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,640
I'm in the ceremony.

585
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,690
Not now, you're not.

586
00:27:44,970 --> 00:27:48,200
You're standing in the
parking lot with me.

587
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,360
I'm in the parking lot with you.

588
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,970
I'm sorry.

589
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,650
I'm sorry.

590
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,309
I'm not very good to
be around right now.

591
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,470
I'm a little bit on edge.

592
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,709
I've--I've been
drinking the human stuff

593
00:28:00,710 --> 00:28:01,960
And it's really
screwing with my head.

594
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,280
Oh! she knows now.

595
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,689
God, she wasn't
supposed to find out.

596
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:09,800
I didn't want her to find out,
now everything's ruined.

597
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:12,430
You seem sad.

598
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:16,870
I'm not sad!

599
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,720
I'm freaking hungry!

600
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,470
Ms. Elena Gilbert,

601
00:28:21,710 --> 00:28:24,130
Escorted by Mr. Stefan salvatore.

602
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:51,130
Where's Stefan? I don't know.

603
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,270
What is she doing with Damon?

604
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,890
I have no idea.

605
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,689
What are we going to do?

606
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,350
Right now we just have
to get through this.

607
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,560
I don't hurt people.

608
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,269
I don't do that.

609
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:38,370
I'm the good brother.

610
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,220
Do you want to hurt me?

611
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,080
I want to kill you.

612
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,100
I want to rip into your skin,

613
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,680
And I want to feed on your blood.

614
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,170
Under your skin,

615
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:04,570
Pulsating, flowing.

616
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:08,680
Your carotid artery, right there.

617
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:11,859
If you puncture this just right,

618
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,290
You can control the blood flow.

619
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,670
It takes practice,

620
00:31:14,671 --> 00:31:17,289
But it doesn't have
to make a mess.

621
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,550
You don't have to waste any.

622
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,650
What's stopping you?

623
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,430
If I do this,

624
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,360
If I give in,
there's no going back.

625
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:30,650
Then don't.

626
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,319
I just want one taste.

627
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,300
That's all I need.
Just one more tast

628
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,170
One taste?

629
00:31:55,070 --> 00:31:55,930
Where's Amber?

630
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,230
I don't know.

631
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,660
Before I crown the winner,

632
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,970
I'd like to offer a
personal thank you

633
00:32:00,971 --> 00:32:03,049
To all of these young
ladies for their efforts

634
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:04,520
To better our communities.

635
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,830
So, without further adieu,

636
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:15,819
It is my honor to announce our
very own miss mystic falls,

637
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,380
Ms. Caroline Forbes!

638
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,740
Congratulations!

639
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:22,030
I actually won!

640
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,950
??

641
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:46,880
Get me Damon salvatore.

642
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,060
I can't do this!

643
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:52,920
What's the matter?
I can't do this.

644
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,540
It's ok.

645
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,190
It doesn't hurt that much.

646
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,760
Just not so hard next time.

647
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,410
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

648
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,470
I can't stop.

649
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,040
I can't stop.

650
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,990
Why aren't you afraid of me, huh?

651
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,800
You told me not to be.

652
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:13,890
What?

653
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:17,450
What's your name?

654
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,630
Amber.

655
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:22,560
Listen to me, Amber.

656
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,550
I need you to be afraid of me.

657
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,179
I need you to run like hell,

658
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,210
Do you understand me?

659
00:33:28,211 --> 00:33:30,210
Run, run, now!

660
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:40,740
What is it, did you find h?

661
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,810
There were signs of struggle
in the upstairs bathroom.

662
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:43,960
There was blood.

663
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,960
And that Amber girl is missing.

664
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,310
Oh, my God.

665
00:33:47,311 --> 00:33:48,940
He wouldn't hurt her.

666
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,069
He won't.

667
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,460
Let's just find him, ok?

668
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,090
Let's get your coat, come on.

669
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,290
You said to run!

670
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,830
I changed my mind.

671
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,030
Stefan! oh!

672
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:12,240
Stefan.

673
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,700
Come on. Get control of it.
Come on.

674
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:17,470
It's ok. Come on.

675
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,290
Breathe through it, man.

676
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,080
Stefan, stop it!

677
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,610
It's ok.

678
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,770
Stefan.

679
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,240
She doesn't remember
what happened.

680
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,119
It's a good thing the girls
got here when they did.

681
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,240
She lost a lot of blood.

682
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,130
You didn't see anything?

683
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,179
No. We just found her

684
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,430
And then called Damon.

685
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,070
She gonna be ok?

686
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,040
Looks like it, yeah.

687
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,130
Why don't you girls
get back to the party.

688
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,120
Damon and I can take it from here.

689
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:35,820
Yeah. Ok.

690
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,540
They didn't see the bite mark?

691
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,599
No, I got here before
they got too close.

692
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,600
There was too much blood,
they couldn't see it clearly.

693
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,989
Bonnie, can we talk about this?

694
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,190
There's nothing to talk about.

695
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:57,910
Bonnie, please.

696
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,110
I told you I wasn't going
to make you choose,

697
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,850
But I need to make the
choice for myself.

698
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,160
Please just leave me alone.

699
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,670
Jer.

700
00:36:22,070 --> 00:36:22,670
You ready?

701
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,140
Uh, just a second.

702
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,100
Who's that girl with Jeremy?

703
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,180
His friend Anna.

704
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,440
What's her story?

705
00:36:35,441 --> 00:36:37,589
Why so nosy? I'm just curious.

706
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,660
He really seems to like her.

707
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,900
She's new in town, I think.

708
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,580
She and her mom, pearl.

709
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,889
The family you're so
rudely trying to prevent

710
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,150
From buying Grayson's building.

711
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,540
Her mother's name is pearl?

712
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,170
Yes, so?

713
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,040
Well, I believe I already
know all about her.

714
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,510
Oh, good, there you are.
Jenna wanted me

715
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,900
To get the car.

716
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,610
What happened?

717
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,560
All right, now this
is getting weird.

718
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,600
We're here to talk.

719
00:37:17,010 --> 00:37:18,369
I'm not in the mood. Today's been

720
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,750
A no-good, very bad day.

721
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,299
Annabelle tells me you're
looking for something

722
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,630
I took fromJohnathan Gilbert.

723
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,220
I'm listening.

724
00:37:30,210 --> 00:37:30,850
What is that?

725
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:33,120
Johnathan was passionate
about his inventions.

726
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:36,829
He confided in me that he had
created a detection device

727
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,340
Meant to track down the
town's vampire element.

728
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,800
It was a pocket watch.

729
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,570
That's what it turned
out to be, yes.

730
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,900
But that's not what I stole.

731
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:48,990
I discovered my mistake when I
saw the watch in Johnathan's hand

732
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,630
The night they took us.

733
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,640
Its dial pointed at me.

734
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,140
So what is this? I have no idea.

735
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,660
But now it's yours.

736
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,380
What's the catch?

737
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:03,550
There's no catch.

738
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,540
My daughter wants to stay here.

739
00:38:08,690 --> 00:38:09,770
I want to stay here.

740
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:13,340
You refuse to trust us,
and for good reason.

741
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,040
Consider this an apology.

742
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:37,670
You shouldn't be here.

743
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:40,050
I know.

744
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:46,960
Now you know.

745
00:38:48,050 --> 00:38:49,250
That wasn't you.

746
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,160
Oh, it was absolutely me.

747
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,719
I'a monster predator.

748
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,690
It's who I am, Elena.

749
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,659
That's what the blood makes you.

750
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,600
The blood brings out
what's inside of me.

751
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,840
And if you think any differently,
then you're an idiot.

752
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,480
I know this isn't you, Stefan.

753
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,270
I wanted to drain

754
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:10,960
Every ounce of blood
from that girl's body.

755
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:13,779
- No.
- It's who I am, Elena.

756
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,500
No. You can't scare me off.

757
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,449
Why would you risk it?

758
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,110
Why would you come here?

759
00:39:19,111 --> 00:39:20,470
Because I did this.

760
00:39:20,970 --> 00:39:22,139
This is my fault.

761
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,350
I'm the one who made you
drink the blood.

762
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:26,369
All you did was expose
me to who I really am.

763
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,289
This isn't you.

764
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,170
Stop saying that!

765
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,789
Don't get any closer to me.

766
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:36,240
I'm not going
to let this happen to you.

767
00:39:36,297 --> 00:39:37,140
Stop.

768
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:39,759
Stefan, I'm not going
to give up on you.

769
00:39:39,879 --> 00:39:40,880
Stop!

770
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:42,200
Stop!

771
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,160
I'm so sorry.

772
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:53,840
It's ok.

773
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,050
It's ok.

774
00:39:59,830 --> 00:40:01,630
I don't know what's
happening to me.

775
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,270
It's ok, Stefan, shhh.

776
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:04,410
It's ok.

777
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:07,140
It's ok.

778
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,590
You're gonna be ok.

779
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,860
Sure you want to do this?

780
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:47,980
I'm sure.

781
00:40:55,890 --> 00:40:57,580
There's no guarantee
this is going to work.

782
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,530
It has to.

783
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:07,030
You comin'?

784
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:09,823
I'm gonna stay here.

785
00:41:10,556 --> 00:41:20,099
