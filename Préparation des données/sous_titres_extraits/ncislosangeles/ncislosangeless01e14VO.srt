1
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:11,179
I'm Guy Johnson,
and this is "On the Line!".

2
00:00:11,492 --> 00:00:12,948
Today, we're with ATF agents

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,182
As they prepare to infiltrate
a group of suspected gun runners.

4
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,497
Going after criminals is one thing,

5
00:00:18,788 --> 00:00:21,646
But going after those who deal
in weapons practically guarantees

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,022
a violent confrontation.

7
00:00:23,957 --> 00:00:26,166
These agents have no idea.
Just how much firepower

8
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:29,323
they're going to have to go
up against. Everything from machine guns

9
00:00:29,472 --> 00:00:32,073
to grenades and even rocket launchers
have been used against them.

10
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:35,009
Agents have breached the door
and are storming inside.

11
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:38,820
I'm not hearing any shots fired,
they go from room to room right now,

12
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:40,311
looking for guns and perps.

13
00:00:40,353 --> 00:00:42,499
- All clear!
- That's us. Let's go.

14
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:44,746
Alpha team all clear.
Building's secure.

15
00:00:44,788 --> 00:00:46,388
<i>Copy that, alpha team.</i>

16
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,107
We're gonna need
a forensic unit in here.

17
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:49,899
<i>Copy.</i>

18
00:00:53,009 --> 00:00:54,559
They're already dead.

19
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,431
My god, they're already dead.

20
00:00:57,907 --> 00:00:58,757
Cut it.

21
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:00,827
I said cut it.

22
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:02,895
What the hell happened here?

23
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,645
.: Team UnderCovers :.

24
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:21,990
NCIS Los Angeles 1x14
- LD50 -

25
00:01:38,994 --> 00:01:40,259
Morning, Hetty.

26
00:01:40,508 --> 00:01:41,635
Where is everybody?

27
00:01:41,677 --> 00:01:44,227
Upstairs waiting
to be briefed on a case.

28
00:01:44,477 --> 00:01:46,077
- Waiting for who?
- For you.

29
00:01:46,199 --> 00:01:47,749
- Okay.
- But first,

30
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,526
You owe me some paperwork.

31
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,820
I already dropped that report off.

32
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:57,566
Everyone received a list
of potential new recruits,

33
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,575
And everyone has returned
his recommendation

34
00:02:01,787 --> 00:02:02,622
 but you.

35
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,626
We don't need a new recruit.
Dom is missing, not dead.

36
00:02:07,218 --> 00:02:09,979
I'm not trying
to replace agent Vail.

37
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,780
I'm trying to give the team
the support it needs

38
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:15,172
until his return.

39
00:02:15,996 --> 00:02:19,246
This isn't an office job, Hetty.
We don't need a temp.

40
00:02:20,381 --> 00:02:22,831
You're right,
this isn't an office job.

41
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:27,712
I'll get to it when I have a chance.

42
00:02:34,665 --> 00:02:36,606
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

43
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:40,660
Have a good day.

44
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:42,344
I will.

45
00:02:42,956 --> 00:02:44,747
Now, you want me
to go upstairs or not?

46
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,858
I'm sorry
I had bothered you with this.

47
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,257
You're not bothering me.

48
00:02:55,479 --> 00:02:56,529
My mistake.

49
00:02:57,444 --> 00:02:58,928
My experience has been

50
00:02:59,993 --> 00:03:01,886
that your need
to get in the last word

51
00:03:02,158 --> 00:03:04,083
is a sign of annoyance.

52
00:03:13,708 --> 00:03:14,782
She found you.

53
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:17,058
- She always does.
- Yeah.

54
00:03:17,684 --> 00:03:18,934
Go ahead, Eric.

55
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:22,640
Night before last,
the reality TV show "On the Line!"

56
00:03:22,682 --> 00:03:25,518
was following ATF agents on a raid
of suspected gun runners,

57
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,841
when they found this.

58
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:31,535
Five dead, no obvious signs of death.
Two in Marine uniforms.

59
00:03:31,969 --> 00:03:34,672
Uniforms are authentic,
the men are not.

60
00:03:35,604 --> 00:03:37,664
- They're not Marines?
- Not even close.

61
00:03:37,706 --> 00:03:39,552
Both guys are career criminals.

62
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:41,801
I know that guy.

63
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,892
Ian Albers. Small-time con.

64
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,391
We bust him before?

65
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:50,254
Nope, not according to his record.

66
00:03:50,846 --> 00:03:53,941
Maybe one of those militia guys
we rounded up in bush a few months back?

67
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:56,193
No. I remember the guys I bust.

68
00:03:57,253 --> 00:03:58,905
But I've met him somewhere.

69
00:03:59,227 --> 00:04:01,574
If these guys aren't real Marines,
it isn't our problem.

70
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:03,409
- LAPD should be handling it.
- They are.

71
00:04:03,625 --> 00:04:05,427
But, Director Vance
wants to know why

72
00:04:05,469 --> 00:04:07,536
these two criminals
were impersonating Marines

73
00:04:07,578 --> 00:04:11,277
With very authentic looking military
IDs, and what the hell they were up to.

74
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:15,338
He wants assurances that the security
of our bases has not been compromised.

75
00:04:22,877 --> 00:04:24,198
What is this place?

76
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:28,256
Eric said it was registered
to a "La Grange enterprises".

77
00:04:28,486 --> 00:04:30,128
Turns out it was a bogus company.

78
00:04:30,832 --> 00:04:33,439
It's a lab,
but they weren't making meth.

79
00:04:34,372 --> 00:04:36,322
Not with what they have here.

80
00:04:37,499 --> 00:04:39,180
So what were they cooking?

81
00:04:39,849 --> 00:04:42,439
I don't know.
Maybe something that killed them.

82
00:04:44,194 --> 00:04:46,551
A drug overdose
would show up on an autopsy.

83
00:04:46,593 --> 00:04:49,600
- So would a communicable disease.
- Fumes of some sort?

84
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:52,463
Which brings me back
to my first question:

85
00:04:53,588 --> 00:04:55,988
What were they making
and where is it?

86
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:02,843
Someone cleaned this place out.

87
00:05:03,726 --> 00:05:05,726
Someone who didn't get killed.

88
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:08,128
What was with the Marine uniforms?

89
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:12,353
You know, feel free
to chime in here anytime.

90
00:05:13,574 --> 00:05:16,190
Looks like those men weren't
the only ones who died here.

91
00:05:23,926 --> 00:05:25,658
- Yeah?
- <i>Hey, Callen, it's Kensi.</i>

92
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:29,698
Eric and I have been sifting through
the electronic records of the dead men.

93
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,517
We found a vector
between a recurring phone number

94
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:34,542
and GPS activity
of one of their vehicles.

95
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:37,378
- You have an address?
- <i>Yeah, it's...</i>

96
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,939
299 north Sierra Bonita.

97
00:05:42,471 --> 00:05:44,029
Owner's name is Balmore.

98
00:05:44,071 --> 00:05:46,554
<i>Great. Have a</i> HazMat team
come out here and sweep this place.

99
00:05:46,798 --> 00:05:47,648
HazMat?

100
00:05:47,943 --> 00:05:50,498
- Callen, what did you guys find?
- I don't know.

101
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,184
<i>If you and Sam have been exposed,</i>

102
00:05:52,374 --> 00:05:54,987
the medical officermust look at you.
Your health could be at risk.

103
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:57,565
<i>You know what?</i> So could yours
if you keep eating the burritos.

104
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:01,789
How did you...

105
00:06:01,831 --> 00:06:04,030
<i>The cheese makes your voice phlegmy.
Not good.</i>

106
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:14,982
Got 13 birds, two squirrels.

107
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:18,044
What are the chances these guys were
cooking up some sort of chemical weapon?

108
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:22,044
I sure I hope not. Because if they were,
then we've been exposed to it.

109
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:35,401
It's a nice neighborhood.

110
00:06:35,443 --> 00:06:37,771
I hate to see small-time cons
hanging out around here.

111
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:40,274
Yeah, small-time cons aren't running
this operation,

112
00:06:40,846 --> 00:06:41,918
whatever it is.

113
00:06:46,035 --> 00:06:47,835
The lawn could use a rake.

114
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,093
What a mess.

115
00:07:10,907 --> 00:07:11,972
Mrs. Balmore?

116
00:07:14,155 --> 00:07:16,680
I'm just all butterfingers today.

117
00:07:17,714 --> 00:07:19,480
I just have to clean this up.

118
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,607
I'm Special Agent Sam Hanna.

119
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:23,391
Special Agent G. Callen.

120
00:07:25,569 --> 00:07:27,822
- Could we ask you a few questions?
- Well, of course, dear.

121
00:07:27,906 --> 00:07:29,759
But I need to clean this up.

122
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:32,921
It was full of sugar water
for the hummingbirds.

123
00:07:32,963 --> 00:07:35,221
So, if I don't hose it off
right now,

124
00:07:35,263 --> 00:07:38,005
It's going to be like <i>Leiningen
versus the Ants</i> back here.

125
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:40,864
- Let me help you with that.
- Oh, thank you very much.

126
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:42,670
Do you recognize these men?

127
00:07:43,154 --> 00:07:44,775
I know Corporal Ames.

128
00:07:44,908 --> 00:07:47,925
And that's Corporal Bishop.
They're my Marine Corps drivers.

129
00:07:48,313 --> 00:07:51,088
- Where did they drive you?
- The research facility.

130
00:07:53,299 --> 00:07:55,266
I wasn't supposed to say that.

131
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,476
It's classified.

132
00:07:57,693 --> 00:07:59,036
National Security.

133
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,751
You can tell us. We're NCIS.

134
00:08:02,887 --> 00:08:03,705
You are?

135
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:10,583
- How's your research going?
- Very well.

136
00:08:11,195 --> 00:08:14,491
I thought I would be rusty
after all of these years,

137
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,237
but I was able

138
00:08:16,396 --> 00:08:18,490
to isolate several grams

139
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:21,208
of clostridium botulinum last week.

140
00:08:22,387 --> 00:08:23,337
Botulism?

141
00:08:24,692 --> 00:08:26,636
Most dangerous toxin known to man.

142
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:30,724
Would either of you gentlemen
like some lemonade?

143
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,008
- Excellent, what about CDC?
- <i>I never wanted to be an Army wife,</i>

144
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,149
<i>but I was in love with</i> my husband.

145
00:08:44,794 --> 00:08:48,485
- There you go.
- You're so kind. Thank you, Steve.

146
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,029
It was Sam, ma'am.

147
00:08:50,642 --> 00:08:52,742
- You're welcome.
- Sam.

148
00:08:53,068 --> 00:08:54,311
I'm so sorry.

149
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,859
Sometimes I think I'd forget my head
if it wasn't attached.

150
00:08:57,901 --> 00:08:59,332
It's fine.
It's okay.

151
00:09:01,543 --> 00:09:05,546
So, you enlisted and wound up working
in the Army's medical unit?

152
00:09:05,828 --> 00:09:06,588
Yes.

153
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:09,553
Now, that was an old boy's network
back then.

154
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:14,539
That was so nice of Steve to bring tea.
Are you married?

155
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:20,173
- Let's talk about...
- A handsome young man like yourself?

156
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,543
I work a lot.

157
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,314
That was Kensi.

158
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,935
The coroner has confirmed
it was botulinum poisoning.

159
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,071
Director Vance,
Homeland Security and CDC

160
00:09:29,113 --> 00:09:31,612
have all been alerted,
along with local medical services.

161
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:33,948
And HazMat's doing a sweep
of Esther's place.

162
00:09:34,896 --> 00:09:37,363
Who knows what else granny
was cooking up there.

163
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:40,871
Should Nate be wearing a mask?

164
00:09:41,531 --> 00:09:44,134
No, he's safe. You don't catch
botulism from other people,

165
00:09:44,804 --> 00:09:48,207
But we might have been exposed because
we were in the lab. You feeling okay?

166
00:09:48,319 --> 00:09:51,131
Yeah, nothing a couple weeks
of vacation can't cure.

167
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,830
I hear that.

168
00:09:53,935 --> 00:09:55,082
You're very tall.

169
00:09:55,719 --> 00:09:57,358
My husband Marty was tall.

170
00:09:57,702 --> 00:10:00,667
He died of a heart attack
at Santa Anita several years ago.

171
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:02,509
He loved the ponies.

172
00:10:04,702 --> 00:10:08,569
Let's talk about your work
at Fort Detrick in the late '60s.

173
00:10:09,249 --> 00:10:10,985
Bacterial purification.

174
00:10:11,584 --> 00:10:13,649
The work we did revolutionized 

175
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:16,115
the production of antibiotics
and other drugs.

176
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,483
And what
about your most recent work?

177
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:21,700
I'm long retired.

178
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,946
And your research at the lab?

179
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:26,364
Lab?

180
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:30,689
Where your two drivers

181
00:10:31,205 --> 00:10:32,022
took you?

182
00:10:34,478 --> 00:10:38,012
I forgot about that.
I helped them isolate proteins.

183
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:42,132
A neurotoxic protein produced by

184
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:44,018
the bacterium C...

185
00:10:44,674 --> 00:10:45,674
botulinum?

186
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,844
Yes, of course.
That's it.

187
00:10:52,249 --> 00:10:54,111
Thank you for reminding me.

188
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:57,610
Why did they need
the botulinum toxin?

189
00:10:58,398 --> 00:10:59,825
Antidote research.

190
00:11:00,168 --> 00:11:02,272
<i>So our boys in uniform will be safe.</i>

191
00:11:03,737 --> 00:11:06,087
She seems
like just a sweet old lady.

192
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,161
She is a sweet old lady.

193
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,462
Someone tricked her into creating
biochemical weapons.

194
00:11:11,919 --> 00:11:13,600
Would you excuse me a moment?

195
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:23,844
Well?

196
00:11:24,319 --> 00:11:27,880
I think she's delightful
and... extremely dangerous.

197
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:29,731
She's suffering from Alzheimer's.

198
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:31,656
She remembers the '60s and '70s in

199
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:34,854
vivid detail, but has memory lapses
about more recent events.

200
00:11:35,184 --> 00:11:38,311
All right, well, it is one thing
to forget to feed your dog,

201
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:40,467
it's another when you forget
security protocols,

202
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:42,409
and you're dealing with bioweapons.

203
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:45,079
She may be responsible
for those men's deaths.

204
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:45,901
Or...

205
00:11:46,816 --> 00:11:48,167
The person behind this

206
00:11:48,209 --> 00:11:50,584
use what she created
to tie up the loose ends.

207
00:11:51,124 --> 00:11:53,554
And if that's the case,
she could be in danger.

208
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,930
Botulinum is a neurotoxin protein.

209
00:11:58,972 --> 00:12:01,772
Very popular in Hollywood,
where it is known as botox.

210
00:12:01,814 --> 00:12:03,819
Kills the muscles
that cause wrinkles for that

211
00:12:03,861 --> 00:12:06,100
"don't I look 20 even though I'm 50?"
look.

212
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:09,436
It can also paralyze your breathing
muscles, and you suffocate to death.

213
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:10,612
In fact,

214
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:13,148
it is the deadliest substance
known to man.

215
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:17,152
The housewives of Beverly Hills should
be classified as biochemical weapons.

216
00:12:17,483 --> 00:12:19,333
Do you guys know what LD50 is?

217
00:12:19,554 --> 00:12:21,113
It's the median lethal dose:

218
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:23,826
The amount of toxin needed
to kill half the people exposed.

219
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,453
Lower the LD50,
the more dangerous the substance.

220
00:12:26,772 --> 00:12:27,772
Exactly.

221
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:30,996
Now, the botulinum toxin
has the lowest LD50 there is.

222
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:31,939
So...

223
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,059
a sample only...

224
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:37,631
this small could kill up
to a quarter million people.

225
00:12:37,766 --> 00:12:39,570
And if what Esther told us
is accurate,

226
00:12:39,612 --> 00:12:42,303
then she isolated enough
to kill ten times that.

227
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,482
She's like the evil Martha Stewart.

228
00:12:44,637 --> 00:12:46,223
Only she's not evil.

229
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,215
She's vulnerable
because of her Alzheimer's,

230
00:12:48,257 --> 00:12:49,847
and whoever's behind this knew that.

231
00:12:49,889 --> 00:12:51,826
They sought her out
and tricked her into thinking

232
00:12:51,868 --> 00:12:54,180
that her expertise
was needed for National Security.

233
00:12:54,222 --> 00:12:57,651
Yeah, she's an easy mark
but an unreliable witness.

234
00:12:57,852 --> 00:12:58,902
Poor thing.

235
00:12:59,205 --> 00:13:01,947
She must have enjoyed
the company and attention.

236
00:13:02,526 --> 00:13:05,566
The real question is, who's behind this,
and where the hell is the toxin?

237
00:13:05,816 --> 00:13:07,044
We may have a lead.

238
00:13:07,462 --> 00:13:09,894
Remember this guy, Ian Albers?

239
00:13:10,273 --> 00:13:11,477
I've been trying to.

240
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,804
Well, he used to be
a bouncer at club Halo

241
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:15,586
for our old pal,

242
00:13:16,536 --> 00:13:17,838
I knew I recognized him.

243
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:21,217
Maybe he's moved on from blackmail
to dealing in bioweapons.

244
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,655
You think Dallas is behind this?

245
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,966
If he is,
he's going to wish he wasn't.

246
00:13:26,275 --> 00:13:28,429
Dallas closed the Halo club
after the Safar incident.

247
00:13:28,471 --> 00:13:31,233
He's been keeping a low profile since.
Apparently, not low enough.

248
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:33,680
The dude's already proven
he has friends in high places.

249
00:13:33,722 --> 00:13:34,730
And low places.

250
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,149
He's going to call his buddies
to shut us down, like last time.

251
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:39,713
- He's not going to cooperate.
- At least not willingly.

252
00:13:39,755 --> 00:13:42,119
And get this.
Supposedly, he replaced his security

253
00:13:42,161 --> 00:13:44,740
with a bunch of retired
East German secret police.

254
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,473
The latest Hollywood accessory,
a special ops security team.

255
00:13:47,515 --> 00:13:49,620
Hetty,
any suggestions on getting Dallas?

256
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:53,345
Yes. I suggest
we don't have this conversation.

257
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,423
Forget diamonds,

258
00:13:55,679 --> 00:13:56,817
in this business,

259
00:13:56,859 --> 00:14:00,207
plausible deniability
is a girl's best friend.

260
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:02,174
Now...

261
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,919
Sit down and say, "ah".

262
00:14:05,273 --> 00:14:07,692
Hetty, honestly...
I'm fine.

263
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:11,433
Asset protection
is part of my responsibility,

264
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,388
And you are an asset.

265
00:14:13,928 --> 00:14:16,071
When you're not being
a pain in the asset.

266
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:18,559
Now, open wide.

267
00:14:24,741 --> 00:14:25,822
What was that for?

268
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:28,513
It's a healthy gag reflex.

269
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,661
It's the first thing to go
in botulinum poisoning.

270
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,498
Stop laughing. You're next.

271
00:14:38,724 --> 00:14:41,788
Dallas hid his electronic footprint
pretty well. He was hard to find.

272
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:45,300
For the record,
I walked away 30 seconds ago.

273
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:46,712
He always was careful.

274
00:14:46,754 --> 00:14:49,283
Last time, we had to go to his club
just to look at his computer.

275
00:14:49,325 --> 00:14:51,227
Yeah, but he didn't hide
his credit cards.

276
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,529
At least not well enough
to hide them from Eric.

277
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:55,997
Apparently, the crime
syndicate is recession-proof.

278
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:59,741
Five days a week, Dallas has been
getting massages at a place called the

279
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,260
"Ahimsa retreat".

280
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:04,203
- What is that?
- A wonderful day spa.

281
00:15:04,948 --> 00:15:07,912
They have
the best foot rescue packages.

282
00:15:08,226 --> 00:15:10,784
It's like sending
your toes to Heaven.

283
00:15:11,846 --> 00:15:15,235
I'm not through
with either of your evaluations.

284
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,997
Hetty, we're both fine.
We really need to move on this.

285
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,710
Well, then,
you'll just have to make it quick.

286
00:15:22,469 --> 00:15:25,005
- You look good in a robe.
- I look good in anything.

287
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:26,326
- Ready?
- Yeah.

288
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:54,878
- What the hell?
- Relax.

289
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:56,656
Don't be so tense.

290
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:59,232
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

291
00:15:59,721 --> 00:16:01,476
Come on.
Are you stupid, Dallas?

292
00:16:01,518 --> 00:16:03,907
You think this is a random robbery?
You're butt naked.

293
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:06,528
I have friends.

294
00:16:06,829 --> 00:16:08,091
Lots and lots of friends.

295
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:10,552
Right now, all you have
is a gun pointed at your head.

296
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:12,554
What do you want?

297
00:16:13,087 --> 00:16:15,173
I want information
on biochemical weapons,

298
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:17,059
Specifically botulinum toxin.

299
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:20,257
- Come on, I'm not involved...
- I didn't ask you If you're involved.

300
00:16:21,054 --> 00:16:22,501
I said I want information.

301
00:16:22,763 --> 00:16:24,495
Now, you got 2 seconds
to come clean,

302
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:26,652
or I guarantee this massage
won't have a happy ending.

303
00:16:27,457 --> 00:16:29,167
I don't mess with that crap.

304
00:16:29,679 --> 00:16:31,047
But there's a guy.

305
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:32,978
He's called the Dutchman.

306
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,327
Supposedly, he's made some,
now he's selling.

307
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:37,290
That's all I know. I swear to God.

308
00:16:38,241 --> 00:16:40,350
God doesn't like
when you swear to him.

309
00:16:40,646 --> 00:16:42,463
And I don't like to be lied to.

310
00:16:43,158 --> 00:16:45,664
Now, if I have to come back here
if I find out you played me,

311
00:16:45,706 --> 00:16:47,839
I'm going to shiatsu your ass
into dog food.

312
00:16:48,088 --> 00:16:49,091
You hear me?

313
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:51,814
Make sure you drink plenty of water.

314
00:16:55,881 --> 00:16:57,533
Stay facing down.

315
00:17:11,074 --> 00:17:14,074
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you...
the Dutchman.

316
00:17:14,271 --> 00:17:15,843
Aka Jacobus Troyger,

317
00:17:15,885 --> 00:17:18,789
aka Sebastian Boon,
aka Jurgen Vanderveer,

318
00:17:18,831 --> 00:17:21,415
aka yada yada.
The guy's got more aliases than Callen.

319
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:22,916
Somehow, I doubt that.

320
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,544
European terrorist.

321
00:17:25,728 --> 00:17:27,379
Technically, he's an arms dealer.

322
00:17:27,915 --> 00:17:30,034
He sells weapons
to radicals and insurgents.

323
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,509
- Ipso facto, he's a terrorist.
- And he's in L.A.

324
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:35,224
I haven't been able to find any record
of him entering the country.

325
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,089
He probably used an alias
that wasn't on our watch list,

326
00:17:38,374 --> 00:17:39,661
then entered through a port

327
00:17:39,703 --> 00:17:42,310
which doesn't have
a facial recognition system in place.

328
00:17:42,395 --> 00:17:44,054
If he's staying
to sell his bioweapon,

329
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,068
there's a good chance
people come to buy it.

330
00:17:46,345 --> 00:17:49,285
I'll check with Homeland Security
and border control.

331
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,715
I'll contact Interpol,

332
00:17:50,757 --> 00:17:53,530
see if they picked up any chatter
or tracked any movement overseas.

333
00:17:53,892 --> 00:17:55,449
Eric, check the flight manifests,

334
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:58,076
port surveillance.
We might just get lucky.

335
00:17:58,491 --> 00:17:59,494
Mr. Callen,

336
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,871
a moment.

337
00:18:02,285 --> 00:18:04,416
If she puts on her rubber gloves,
run.

338
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,777
Hetty, I appreciate the concern,

339
00:18:07,819 --> 00:18:10,124
but I draw the line
at turning my head and coughing.

340
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:13,980
I'm going to pretend
you didn't say that.

341
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,863
Now, first,

342
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:20,515
how is our elderly bioweaponeer,

343
00:18:20,707 --> 00:18:21,836
Esther Balmore?

344
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:24,436
- Getting her medical evaluation.
- Oh, good.

345
00:18:25,966 --> 00:18:26,980
That was first.

346
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:28,644
What's second?

347
00:18:29,259 --> 00:18:30,233
Your partner.

348
00:18:30,584 --> 00:18:32,532
Sam has been reluctant to weigh in

349
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:35,370
on the selections
for a temporary agent.

350
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,639
Sam doesn't play well with others,
and he doesn't like to share his toys.

351
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:41,300
But times like these

352
00:18:41,342 --> 00:18:43,640
only emphasize the void left...

353
00:18:44,129 --> 00:18:46,579
by the absence of Agent Vail,

354
00:18:46,841 --> 00:18:48,231
however temporary.

355
00:18:48,852 --> 00:18:51,188
Sam is eternally hopeful

356
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,590
that Dom is going
to return to his post.

357
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,518
Sam sees the glass as half full.
I see it as half empty.

358
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:58,206
It's why we make a good team.

359
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:00,472
Kensi,
just drinks right out of the bottle.

360
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,902
Nate wonders why it's a glass,
and Eric breaks the glass

361
00:19:02,944 --> 00:19:05,411
- by putting his feet up on the table.
- Nevertheless,

362
00:19:05,453 --> 00:19:07,021
I want his input,

363
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,943
if only to begin
to move him forward.

364
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:13,735
Maybe you could
give him a little... nudge.

365
00:19:14,877 --> 00:19:16,488
Big guy does not like to be nudged.

366
00:19:22,859 --> 00:19:23,995
I'll be gentle.

367
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:25,127
Thank you.

368
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:32,958
Tell me something good.

369
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:34,383
Sam was right.

370
00:19:34,565 --> 00:19:37,027
Interpol has various persons
of interest who were stopped

371
00:19:37,069 --> 00:19:39,044
boarding planes bound for L.A.

372
00:19:39,201 --> 00:19:42,451
- In Berlin, London and Madrid.
- We put LAX on full alert.

373
00:19:42,823 --> 00:19:43,890
And we got a hit.

374
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,392
Simon Amputuan.

375
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:48,780
He's a Filipino militant
with ties to Abu Sayyaf.

376
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:52,284
Also known
as Al-harakat Alislamiyya,

377
00:19:52,808 --> 00:19:54,358
or Islamic Movement.

378
00:19:54,546 --> 00:19:56,768
They've been waging a bloody campaign
of kidnappings,

379
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,235
bombings and assassinations

380
00:19:58,277 --> 00:20:00,824
in their fight for an independent
Muslim state in the Philippines.

381
00:20:01,016 --> 00:20:03,113
Call ICE...
hold Amputuan for questioning,

382
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,602
and have Nate meet us
at the boathouse.

383
00:20:06,212 --> 00:20:07,796
I don't know any Dutchman.

384
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:12,002
You realize you're on a terrorist
watch list, Mr. Amputuan?

385
00:20:12,398 --> 00:20:14,415
There are many Amputuans
in the Philippines.

386
00:20:14,457 --> 00:20:16,523
You must be mistaking me
for someone else.

387
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,940
I've heard there are well over
a million people on those watch lists.

388
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:22,607
It must be easy to make mistakes.

389
00:20:23,616 --> 00:20:26,349
What about your involvement
with the militant group, Abu Sayyaf?

390
00:20:26,834 --> 00:20:27,746
Again,

391
00:20:27,906 --> 00:20:30,128
I'm afraid you have
the wrong information.

392
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,855
I run a business call center.

393
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:34,732
Great. He's not just a terrorist,
he's a telemarketer.

394
00:20:35,369 --> 00:20:36,760
That's almost worse.

395
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,147
I don't appreciate
your racial profiling.

396
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:42,181
This isn't about race, Mr. Amputuan.
It's about terrorism,

397
00:20:42,558 --> 00:20:44,966
like your involvement
with the 2004 SuperFerry bombing,

398
00:20:45,102 --> 00:20:46,870
killing 116 people.

399
00:20:47,109 --> 00:20:50,665
That was a tragedy that had nothing
whatsoever to do with me.

400
00:20:51,594 --> 00:20:53,257
Clock's ticking, Nate.

401
00:20:54,135 --> 00:20:56,546
- Time to turn up the heat.
- Please.

402
00:20:56,998 --> 00:20:58,867
Okay, here's the deal, Simon.

403
00:21:00,103 --> 00:21:02,337
The Dutchman was arrested
this morning,

404
00:21:02,901 --> 00:21:06,023
- and he started naming names.
- But I told you, I don't know him.

405
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:06,833
Really?

406
00:21:07,556 --> 00:21:09,231
'cause if you didn't know the guy,

407
00:21:09,390 --> 00:21:12,295
then you would've at least been curious
to see who I was talking about.

408
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,324
Sorry. Too late.

409
00:21:14,933 --> 00:21:17,481
So, you're either going
to cooperate and work with us,

410
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:19,598
or you're going
to get fingered by Jacobus,

411
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,429
or whatever name you know him by.

412
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:29,596
I would feel better if I was provided
with legal counsel,

413
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:33,289
from here on in,
just so as to ensure there are no...

414
00:21:34,086 --> 00:21:35,377
misunderstandings.

415
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:37,962
Fortunately for us,
you're an unlawful combatant.

416
00:21:38,244 --> 00:21:41,174
Unfortunately, the boys
at Guantanamo Bay have no vacancy.

417
00:21:41,379 --> 00:21:43,407
So much for that sunny
Caribbean getaway.

418
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:45,339
We do know some Mossad agents

419
00:21:45,381 --> 00:21:47,965
that would gladly buy you
an all-expense-paid trip to Tel Aviv.

420
00:21:48,007 --> 00:21:49,458
Can you say, "Shalom"?

421
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:54,436
Okay.

422
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,615
There is a rumor that the Dutchman

423
00:21:57,859 --> 00:22:00,610
is auctioning off
the botulinum toxin.

424
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:01,444
Where?

425
00:22:03,547 --> 00:22:04,721
I don't know.

426
00:22:04,907 --> 00:22:07,137
You've come a long way
to not know where you're going.

427
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:09,838
I didn't say I was here
for the auction.

428
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,530
I said I heard rumors of it.

429
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:14,539
I also heard of a rendezvous point.

430
00:22:14,581 --> 00:22:17,063
I imagine it could be
someplace where...

431
00:22:17,218 --> 00:22:20,109
a would-be bidder could be picked up
and taken to the proceedings.

432
00:22:20,151 --> 00:22:21,860
You ever meet the Dutchman?

433
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:25,096
- No. I told you...
- Yeah. You know what? We got it.

434
00:22:25,498 --> 00:22:27,295
We want an address,
we want code words,

435
00:22:27,337 --> 00:22:29,514
and everything else
you've heard rumors about.

436
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,941
What if the Dutchman's seen
pictures of Amputuan?

437
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:33,629
He must have screened these guys.

438
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:34,936
I'll go in as his muscle.

439
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,830
I'm gonna review the files,
learn the history, his associates.

440
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:39,524
- Know it cold.
- I don't like this.

441
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,938
I don't, either,
but the auction's today.

442
00:22:42,639 --> 00:22:44,554
We don't have time
to plan anything else.

443
00:22:44,596 --> 00:22:46,906
Besides, I'm the only one
vaccinated for botulism.

444
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,034
Seals are inoculated for everything,

445
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:51,077
except suicidal tendencies.

446
00:22:52,175 --> 00:22:54,748
And he knows I'm right,
or else he'd argue to go instead of me.

447
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,332
I don't want either of you to go.

448
00:22:57,696 --> 00:22:58,588
Relax.

449
00:22:58,972 --> 00:23:00,587
Sam's the best man for this job.

450
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:02,976
What's the worst thing
that could happen?

451
00:23:03,018 --> 00:23:04,474
I don't know. Let's see...

452
00:23:04,611 --> 00:23:06,384
Sam gets made, they kill him.

453
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:08,822
Then you, Kensi and the others
storm the place,

454
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:10,782
and he releases the toxin,
killing...

455
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:12,807
all of you and half of Los Angeles?

456
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,202
Which half?

457
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:16,761
I'm going to go brief the Director.

458
00:23:22,731 --> 00:23:24,235
You have had your shots, right?

459
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:26,112
Yeah, I had a shot.

460
00:23:26,514 --> 00:23:27,530
Annual boosters?

461
00:23:28,987 --> 00:23:29,949
I go suit up.

462
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,017
The vest is tight.

463
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:40,647
It's rubbing.

464
00:23:41,091 --> 00:23:43,644
Well, better chafed
than dead, I say.

465
00:23:44,435 --> 00:23:45,991
The camera is right here.

466
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,483
They'll probably sweep you, so
the electronics we're providing you with

467
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:51,893
can be remotely
activated and deactivated

468
00:23:51,935 --> 00:23:54,134
so as not to be detected, all right?

469
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,476
Eric, let's give it a try.

470
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:57,977
Turning Sam on now.

471
00:24:02,312 --> 00:24:03,212
Scary.

472
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:08,625
They'll take your phone and any gun

473
00:24:09,093 --> 00:24:10,657
so I'm providing you

474
00:24:10,918 --> 00:24:11,898
with this.

475
00:24:13,898 --> 00:24:15,813
It's a ballistics briefcase.

476
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,455
It'll stop most bullets.

477
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:20,179
Inside are $3 million dollars

478
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,171
in marked bearer bonds.

479
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,504
And twist,

480
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:25,675
pull...

481
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,674
and <i>voilà</i>!

482
00:24:27,902 --> 00:24:29,226
A ceramic blade.

483
00:24:30,544 --> 00:24:31,400
That's it?

484
00:24:31,564 --> 00:24:33,972
No, you know,
parachute or shark repellent?

485
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:37,183
I put that in your shoes.

486
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,885
Botulinum protocols?

487
00:24:39,447 --> 00:24:41,312
Ingest it or inhale it, you die.

488
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,350
Get it in an open wound, you die.

489
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,233
Let's hope the vaccine works.

490
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:46,716
I almost forgot.

491
00:24:47,044 --> 00:24:48,826
In here is an ampule

492
00:24:49,177 --> 00:24:51,158
of an experimental antidote.

493
00:24:51,509 --> 00:24:53,243
Click for the needle.

494
00:24:54,345 --> 00:24:55,997
If you're exposed,

495
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,495
use it just

496
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,892
for good measure.

497
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:02,979
Callen and the rest will be running
a box around you the entire time.

498
00:25:03,021 --> 00:25:04,252
Keep it loose.

499
00:25:04,945 --> 00:25:06,223
No helicopters.

500
00:25:06,609 --> 00:25:08,016
These guys will be paranoid.

501
00:25:08,226 --> 00:25:09,357
You're not ready?

502
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:11,426
You take longer
to get dressed than Kensi.

503
00:25:11,759 --> 00:25:13,595
I have been ready for five minutes.

504
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,637
Let's do it.

505
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,766
Sam looks
like he's getting impatient.

506
00:25:18,153 --> 00:25:18,975
He is.

507
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:22,746
And in about ten seconds,
he's gonna complain about it.

508
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:26,232
They're late.

509
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:31,946
You guys know
each other pretty well?

510
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,200
We should.

511
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:37,466
We've been together longer
than most married couples in this town.

512
00:25:39,932 --> 00:25:41,292
You worried about him?

513
00:25:44,229 --> 00:25:46,227
Right now,
I'm worried about all of us.

514
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:48,963
Yeah.

515
00:25:52,037 --> 00:25:53,678
What if Amputuan lied?

516
00:25:59,714 --> 00:26:02,393
- <i>Hollywood boulevard?</i>
- Sorry. I'm not from around here.

517
00:26:02,784 --> 00:26:04,395
Oh. Where are you from?

518
00:26:05,034 --> 00:26:06,159
Lots of places.

519
00:26:07,155 --> 00:26:08,303
What's your name?

520
00:26:08,678 --> 00:26:10,109
None of your business.

521
00:26:15,417 --> 00:26:17,046
He was grabbed at the airport.

522
00:26:18,042 --> 00:26:19,237
I beg your pardon?

523
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,550
Amputuan.

524
00:26:20,983 --> 00:26:23,665
I got through. I'm authorized
to negotiate on his behalf.

525
00:26:25,603 --> 00:26:27,627
Sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

526
00:26:27,911 --> 00:26:30,922
I have 3 million dollars in bearer bonds
that says your boss does.

527
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:34,579
Excuse me.

528
00:26:40,883 --> 00:26:41,997
Think he bought it?

529
00:26:43,093 --> 00:26:44,558
We'll find out soon.

530
00:26:50,687 --> 00:26:52,068
Follow me, please.

531
00:27:26,627 --> 00:27:27,729
That's it.

532
00:27:28,409 --> 00:27:29,463
Close it up.

533
00:27:59,363 --> 00:28:01,637
I'm so sorry for the hood, mister...

534
00:28:02,011 --> 00:28:03,306
Cook. Felix Cook.

535
00:28:04,086 --> 00:28:05,738
That's him. That's the seller,

536
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:07,685
Jacobus Troyger, the Dutchman.

537
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:10,490
Just one more little
security protocol.

538
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:13,268
Blondie patted me down
pretty good back there.

539
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:16,080
What do they say during those
American football broadcasts?

540
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:19,581
Any recording of this game without
the NFL's consent is prohibited.

541
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,367
Same courtesy applies here.

542
00:28:23,062 --> 00:28:23,789
Okay.

543
00:28:26,531 --> 00:28:27,703
Cut his equipment.

544
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,793
Let's hope
we can get him back again.

545
00:28:34,488 --> 00:28:35,449
He's good.

546
00:28:38,297 --> 00:28:39,258
Thank you.

547
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,429
Please.

548
00:28:45,614 --> 00:28:47,683
LAPD, Swat and HazMat are en route.

549
00:28:48,007 --> 00:28:50,103
<i>Rendez-vous</i> is at 7th and Santa Fe.
Nolan,

550
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:52,272
you coordinate with Swat.
I want them in position,

551
00:28:52,314 --> 00:28:54,148
stay out of sight until we go in.

552
00:28:54,386 --> 00:28:55,229
Morris...

553
00:28:55,271 --> 00:28:57,241
you got HazMat.
They got to be right on our heels.

554
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:58,778
I don't need anyone else dying.

555
00:28:59,182 --> 00:29:00,947
Start on the rear, move forward.

556
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,373
All right, let's go.

557
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,035
Eric,

558
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,996
- <i>what's it looking like in there?</i>
- Without Sam's feed, we're blind.

559
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,123
Turn him back on.

560
00:29:14,857 --> 00:29:16,796
Troyger must be employing
a jamming device.

561
00:29:17,036 --> 00:29:20,153
I can enhance this later,
but for the live op, this is it.

562
00:29:24,492 --> 00:29:25,972
He look familiar to you?

563
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:29,475
<i>You're gonna have turn
a little more, Sam.</i>

564
00:29:30,446 --> 00:29:31,269
<i>That's it.</i>

565
00:29:33,335 --> 00:29:35,843
My, my. Benno Dragovic.

566
00:29:36,183 --> 00:29:39,358
Supplies Serbian
mercenaries worldwide.

567
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:42,572
There are a lot of people
in Washington who will want to see

568
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:44,407
what we've stumbled upon here.

569
00:29:45,075 --> 00:29:47,827
We're not seeing any more cars come in,
Sam. You think the gang's all here?

570
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,950
Looks like this party's starting.

571
00:29:54,573 --> 00:29:56,627
What kind of firepower
we talking about, Sam?

572
00:30:01,444 --> 00:30:03,259
You ever see <i>The Dirty Dozen</i>?

573
00:30:03,612 --> 00:30:04,631
A dozen?

574
00:30:05,311 --> 00:30:06,354
You ready?

575
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,678
Let's do it.

576
00:30:11,217 --> 00:30:12,201
<i>Tracking.</i>

577
00:30:14,298 --> 00:30:16,279
All teams moving into position.

578
00:30:16,701 --> 00:30:17,615
<i>Welcome.</i>

579
00:30:18,962 --> 00:30:21,166
<i>In 1969, when the U.S. Army</i>

580
00:30:21,447 --> 00:30:23,196
<i>stopped making biochemical weapons,</i>

581
00:30:23,638 --> 00:30:26,451
<i>They were far more advanced
than they admitted publicly.</i>

582
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,174
I have recruited an Army scientist
that remembers the recipes.

583
00:30:30,876 --> 00:30:32,025
On offer today...

584
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:36,290
a botulinum that is highly flexible.

585
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:40,129
It can be vaporized against troops

586
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,423
on the battlefield.

587
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,567
Or you can spread it on bullets,

588
00:30:43,931 --> 00:30:46,302
and even a flesh wound
becomes lethal.

589
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:50,556
Abu Nassim, the old warhorse.

590
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:53,599
He's not on Troyger's list
of known associates.

591
00:30:53,862 --> 00:30:55,116
Oh, sure he is.

592
00:30:55,748 --> 00:30:56,896
Abu Nassim

593
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,982
Isn't a name.
It's an honorific, from a culture

594
00:31:00,321 --> 00:31:03,861
where older people
are revered with marks

595
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:07,121
of respect.
His name is Sadiki Hassan.

596
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:09,867
He's on there,

597
00:31:10,056 --> 00:31:11,369
your honor lady lange.

598
00:31:12,658 --> 00:31:14,264
This party favor

599
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,408
is a vaccine to the botulinum.

600
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,374
Uncle Sam would never let you
have this.

601
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,880
I hope we don't need it.

602
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,683
Now get in position.

603
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:34,920
Now...

604
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:38,845
you should all know
the value of what you are buying.

605
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:44,254
And as many of you will resell
in your various markets,

606
00:31:45,227 --> 00:31:47,945
I thought a demonstration
would add value.

607
00:31:48,766 --> 00:31:50,366
What kind of demonstration?

608
00:31:51,248 --> 00:31:53,346
<i>The kind that makes
international news.</i>

609
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:05,298
The Mall.

610
00:32:06,091 --> 00:32:09,314
Is there a more iconic place
of American consumerism?

611
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,097
Within the hour,
an associate of mine

612
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:16,934
will deploy just a few micrograms
of the botulinum,

613
00:32:17,627 --> 00:32:20,563
Cut with a vaporizing powder
that will carry it throughout the Mall.

614
00:32:21,029 --> 00:32:22,025
What Mall?

615
00:32:24,612 --> 00:32:26,402
I can't tell what we're looking at.

616
00:32:27,073 --> 00:32:28,195
Where is that?

617
00:32:28,796 --> 00:32:30,489
Here, in Los Angeles.

618
00:32:31,304 --> 00:32:33,706
But don't worry, Mr. Cook.
You are safe here.

619
00:32:34,316 --> 00:32:35,101
Yeah?

620
00:32:35,361 --> 00:32:37,538
What if I want to do a little shopping
before I go home?

621
00:32:42,017 --> 00:32:43,628
Is that the Hollywood town center?

622
00:32:44,631 --> 00:32:46,047
Or is it the Sunset avenue Mall?

623
00:32:47,197 --> 00:32:50,912
Let's just concentrate on the shopping
in here first, shall we?

624
00:32:52,417 --> 00:32:54,257
Assault teams back
to covert positions.

625
00:32:54,432 --> 00:32:56,515
Eric, Kensi and I will take
the Hollywood town center.

626
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,850
Send agents over to Sunset.

627
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,977
And HazMat teams to both places.
I'm already on it.

628
00:33:02,294 --> 00:33:03,770
I don't want to spook Troyger.

629
00:33:03,939 --> 00:33:06,874
Nobody makes a move on the warehouse
till we find this guy at the Mall.

630
00:33:06,916 --> 00:33:08,569
Big guy, I got some bad news.

631
00:33:08,902 --> 00:33:10,800
<i>You're going to have
to stall for a while.</i>

632
00:33:12,195 --> 00:33:15,236
As you all know, the bidding
will begin at 1 million dollars.

633
00:33:16,525 --> 00:33:17,521
Excuse me.

634
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,746
I'm sorry.

635
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:20,891
But I'm concerned
about your demonstration.

636
00:33:21,235 --> 00:33:23,415
We still have to get
this stuff out of the country.

637
00:33:24,283 --> 00:33:27,046
If a whole bunch of people get killed
in a biochemical attack,

638
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:29,502
they're going to lock
the whole city down.

639
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:32,442
You would rather pay several million
dollars for something that,

640
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:34,387
as far as you know,
could be crushed aspirin?

641
00:33:35,474 --> 00:33:38,111
Does anyone else share
Mr. Cook's concerns?

642
00:33:43,464 --> 00:33:46,232
Apparently, you are the only one
who seems to be bothered by this,

643
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,650
Mr. Cook.

644
00:33:48,047 --> 00:33:49,243
And why is that?

645
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,741
I just want to do this smart.

646
00:34:10,866 --> 00:34:13,759
Seriously, are we here
to buy weapons or for you to perv on me?

647
00:34:14,012 --> 00:34:16,053
'cause if these pants come off,
I want a discount.

648
00:34:16,476 --> 00:34:18,347
A big discount.
You know what I'm saying?

649
00:34:18,533 --> 00:34:20,683
All I know is that you are
a very stupid man.

650
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,858
I'm stupid?

651
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,354
At least I don't have these two
in the same room.

652
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:27,725
Dragovic there killed Hassan's boy.

653
00:34:27,912 --> 00:34:30,022
- Don't listen to him.
- Chechnya,

654
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,068
2002.

655
00:34:32,034 --> 00:34:33,571
Hassan's boy is over there, 

656
00:34:33,803 --> 00:34:35,072
paying his jihadi dues,

657
00:34:35,561 --> 00:34:37,116
Ol'Drago was running black ops

658
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,128
for... Putin.

659
00:34:38,988 --> 00:34:40,661
Code name: Crusader.

660
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:41,704
<i>Sheitan.</i>

661
00:35:20,107 --> 00:35:21,911
You still haven't done me
the courtesy.

662
00:35:22,146 --> 00:35:23,224
I'm a ghost.

663
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,818
Put your hands behind your back
and shut up!

664
00:35:35,514 --> 00:35:38,469
I'm not seeing anyone from the file
of known associates at either place.

665
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:41,321
Nobody acting like they're about
to kill hundreds of people.

666
00:35:41,485 --> 00:35:42,763
Any luck there, Hetty?

667
00:35:42,939 --> 00:35:44,087
<i>Working on it.</i>

668
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,869
I can't do this.

669
00:35:46,326 --> 00:35:48,813
I mean,
all those people and it's my fault.

670
00:35:49,057 --> 00:35:51,835
Esther, try not to think about why.

671
00:35:52,545 --> 00:35:55,203
Let's pretend
that we are looking for...

672
00:35:55,537 --> 00:35:56,839
old friends.

673
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:01,567
Our friend that we're looking for
would be right there.

674
00:36:02,393 --> 00:36:04,481
Now, who do you know?

675
00:36:06,094 --> 00:36:09,320
Listen to you using
the objective case properly.

676
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,723
Look!

677
00:36:12,765 --> 00:36:15,515
That's Captain Hogue!
There, there with the backpack.

678
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,583
<i>Hollywood town center.</i>

679
00:36:21,981 --> 00:36:24,682
Eric, could you go back
to the last feed?

680
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,673
Callen, level six.

681
00:36:31,435 --> 00:36:33,077
<i>Tall, Caucasian male,</i>

682
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:34,215
<i>30s,</i>

683
00:36:34,414 --> 00:36:35,259
<i>bald,</i>

684
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,960
<i>yellow backpack.</i>

685
00:36:37,136 --> 00:36:38,227
Can't see him.

686
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,031
Guys, he's forcing himself
to walk casually,

687
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:43,283
but he's trying to hide
an adrenaline surge.

688
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:45,411
This guy is moments
away from deploying.

689
00:36:48,594 --> 00:36:50,374
I got him.
He's heading for the food court.

690
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:06,181
I just take this for a second.
Thank you.

691
00:37:07,621 --> 00:37:09,614
Oh, my gosh, I am so sorry.

692
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,287
Everybody, down!

693
00:37:19,881 --> 00:37:21,336
Everybody, down!

694
00:37:59,189 --> 00:38:00,611
Keep the vial in the water!

695
00:38:02,356 --> 00:38:05,574
Keep it out of the air. We stay
right here till HazMat scrubs us.

696
00:38:10,644 --> 00:38:11,705
I hate needles!

697
00:38:11,981 --> 00:38:13,225
It's the antidote, G.

698
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:14,541
I just saved your life.

699
00:38:14,797 --> 00:38:16,210
I didn't get a warning?

700
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,295
Oh, now I got to warn you
to save your life?

701
00:38:19,892 --> 00:38:21,617
Just keep the vial in the water!

702
00:38:22,191 --> 00:38:24,701
Understood, Director.
That's why I like my job.

703
00:38:26,963 --> 00:38:28,124
Okay, got it.

704
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,651
The FBI's doing the press conference

705
00:38:33,693 --> 00:38:35,730
announcing the arrests
of Troyger and the others.

706
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,315
And stealing our credit?
That was all us.

707
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,650
Sam and you and me.

708
00:38:40,272 --> 00:38:41,070
Right.

709
00:38:41,891 --> 00:38:43,228
But, we don't exist.

710
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,657
That's why you like your job,
because we don't exist.

711
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,034
I like my job
'cause I do press conferences.

712
00:38:51,275 --> 00:38:53,872
It's true,
you do have a better face for radio.

713
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:03,433
Ms. Blye, if you touch that thermostat,
It'll be to turn it down.

714
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:07,464
But I'm cold and Callen was pushed
in a fountain today.

715
00:39:07,506 --> 00:39:09,562
Which is exactly

716
00:39:09,725 --> 00:39:11,682
why we need cost cutting.

717
00:39:12,389 --> 00:39:16,145
The Koi fish in that fountain
went belly up from the botulinum.

718
00:39:17,123 --> 00:39:20,274
Oh, dear,
one so rarely uses that phrase

719
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,906
literally. Poor things.

720
00:39:22,635 --> 00:39:26,535
Anyway,
the Mall has billed us $72,000.

721
00:39:27,292 --> 00:39:28,641
- For fish?!
- Yes.

722
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,254
You know what I could buy with that?

723
00:39:32,314 --> 00:39:33,944
I have a pretty good idea.

724
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,435
Apparently, they're a prized lineage

725
00:39:37,477 --> 00:39:40,015
of Taisho Sanke from Japan.

726
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,882
Dead fish will be here in the morning
so I can see them for myself.

727
00:39:46,809 --> 00:39:49,320
What?
I know the difference between Koi

728
00:39:49,507 --> 00:39:51,388
and carp and crap.

729
00:39:53,927 --> 00:39:54,725
All done.

730
00:39:56,215 --> 00:39:58,561
My psychological evaluation
of Esther Balmore.

731
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:01,690
And my strong recommendation
that she not be charged.

732
00:40:02,516 --> 00:40:04,345
She thought
she was serving her country.

733
00:40:05,952 --> 00:40:07,489
She won't be charged.

734
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,212
That's not all. She needs,

735
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:15,453
someone to adjust her medications,

736
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:17,206
consistent home nursing...

737
00:40:21,616 --> 00:40:22,795
I'll take care of it.

738
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:43,432
You've come to offer to call the ADA

739
00:40:43,772 --> 00:40:45,262
for Esther Balmore.

740
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,681
Because...

741
00:40:47,338 --> 00:40:48,417
you think

742
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:52,574
watching an old lady go batty
has set off a nerve in me.

743
00:40:53,957 --> 00:40:55,517
I came for a cup of tea

744
00:40:55,824 --> 00:40:57,372
because I'm cold.

745
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,548
You know, in nursing homes,
they only have tea in bags.

746
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:09,099
It just tastes like paper.

747
00:41:10,566 --> 00:41:12,136
When the time comes,

748
00:41:12,618 --> 00:41:14,263
I'll bring you the good stuff.

749
00:41:14,448 --> 00:41:16,032
Smuggle it in if I have to.

750
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:18,567
Go in undercover...

751
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:21,347
As an orderly?

752
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:23,705
Whatever you need.

753
00:41:32,956 --> 00:41:33,949
You know...

754
00:41:34,705 --> 00:41:37,028
It's not the loneliness I fear.

755
00:41:39,386 --> 00:41:40,873
But you are scared of something.

756
00:41:40,957 --> 00:41:41,720
Yes.

757
00:41:42,741 --> 00:41:43,716
Spilling

758
00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:45,792
everything I know.

759
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:48,303
All my secrets being

760
00:41:48,345 --> 00:41:51,388
blathered out into a world
that should never hear them.

761
00:41:54,577 --> 00:41:56,958
So, when the time comes,
as you put it,

762
00:41:57,205 --> 00:41:59,183
there's something you can do.

763
00:42:00,103 --> 00:42:02,460
You can smother me with a pillow.

764
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,346
Make sure it's synthetic.

765
00:42:05,545 --> 00:42:07,411
I'm allergic to feathers.

766
00:42:08,783 --> 00:42:09,545
Okay.

767
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:16,237
Oh, the birds will be so happy!

768
00:42:17,246 --> 00:42:20,354
The delivery man just
left them out front,

769
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:22,454
and I just couldn't move them.

770
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:26,506
You are so kind,

771
00:42:26,682 --> 00:42:27,461
Steve.

772
00:42:30,658 --> 00:42:31,632
That's not it.

773
00:42:34,026 --> 00:42:35,093
What is it, dear?

774
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:36,489
I'm Sam.

775
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,507
Sam!

776
00:42:39,799 --> 00:42:40,557
Right.

777
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:46,369
Say...

778
00:42:46,827 --> 00:42:47,906
- Sam.
- Yes?

779
00:42:49,067 --> 00:42:50,698
This stone fountain.

780
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,498
Don't you think it would look better

781
00:42:54,699 --> 00:42:55,626
if it was

782
00:42:56,048 --> 00:42:57,033
over there?

783
00:43:00,517 --> 00:43:01,304
Sure.

784
00:43:02,735 --> 00:43:04,108
Piece of cake, Esther.

785
00:43:12,128 --> 00:43:13,794
Oh, careful, Steve!
