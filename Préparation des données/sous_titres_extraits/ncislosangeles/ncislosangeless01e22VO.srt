1
00:00:13,255 --> 00:00:14,778
Here comes another one!

2
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:17,040
See, I knew it!

3
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:18,976
Look at those turbojet engines,

4
00:00:19,395 --> 00:00:20,837
the upswept winglets.

5
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,317
I totally schooled you!

6
00:00:25,317 --> 00:00:27,130
Kill the smug mug, Amelia Ass-heart.

7
00:00:27,172 --> 00:00:29,070
I got three right without
the extra pair

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,150
of eyes.

9
00:00:30,713 --> 00:00:32,716
Must be private. No markings.

10
00:00:33,174 --> 00:00:34,873
Maybe it's somebody famous.

11
00:00:36,367 --> 00:00:38,312
- Looks like a Gulfstream.
- You sure?

12
00:00:38,678 --> 00:00:41,174
You can tell by the passenger windows
on the side.

13
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,553
Looks like a bodyguard.

14
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,754
And there's another one.

15
00:00:48,018 --> 00:00:48,780
Down.

16
00:00:52,706 --> 00:00:55,763
Those are cops, man.
The other guy's got cuffs on!

17
00:01:01,538 --> 00:01:03,479
Are you seeing this?
My God!

18
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:10,989
Maybe they're shooting a movie.

19
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:12,371
Dude,

20
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,073
that's no movie.

21
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,558
.: Team UnderCovers :.

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,379
NCIS Los Angeles 1x22
- Hunted -

23
00:01:44,224 --> 00:01:45,583
Eat your breakfast.

24
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,393
You okay?

25
00:02:45,435 --> 00:02:47,368
I'm not comfortable
with authority figures.

26
00:02:47,971 --> 00:02:49,168
It's why I do what I do.

27
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:51,698
Computers don't talk back.

28
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:53,280
Technically, they can.

29
00:02:54,006 --> 00:02:57,135
But even then I can manipulate
the voice to make it soothing if I want.

30
00:02:58,218 --> 00:02:59,296
Sexy, even.

31
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:02,974
Too much information.

32
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:05,518
What did he ask you?

33
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,577
Same thing I'm gonna ask you,
Agent Callen.

34
00:03:09,749 --> 00:03:11,097
Finish your report?

35
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:14,648
Have you started your report?

36
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:20,337
We just buried Agent Vail two days ago?
Director.

37
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,371
Does this charade really need
to be perpetuated any longer?

38
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,384
Charade?

39
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:28,583
Hetty, you know as well as I do

40
00:03:28,891 --> 00:03:30,613
procedure has to be verified,

41
00:03:30,754 --> 00:03:32,295
reports have to be filed.

42
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,223
Yes, I see.

43
00:03:34,832 --> 00:03:38,259
And by the Director
of the entire agency, too.

44
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,512
Don't get me wrong.

45
00:03:41,816 --> 00:03:45,765
Your presence here is always valued,
even welcomed.

46
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,925
And I much prefer
to converse with you face-to-face,

47
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,315
but let's drop the pretense,
shall we?

48
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:56,861
The only thing

49
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,655
your presence
is not going to do is this,

50
00:04:01,253 --> 00:04:02,155
change...

51
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:03,057
my...

52
00:04:03,099 --> 00:04:03,924
mind.

53
00:04:19,856 --> 00:04:20,843
This is Vance.

54
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:24,221
When?

55
00:04:26,348 --> 00:04:27,262
How many?

56
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:30,079
Right.

57
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:32,897
I need everybody upstairs right now.

58
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,195
An hour ago, there was a shootout,

59
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:41,589
private jetport, Van Nuys.

60
00:04:42,644 --> 00:04:45,011
A couple of amateur plane spotters
recorded the incident

61
00:04:45,053 --> 00:04:47,601
with a video camera
and a pair of digital binoculars.

62
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:50,164
It's a prisoner transfer.
One of ours?

63
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,904
Military Police.
One dead, two wounded.

64
00:04:53,232 --> 00:04:54,286
Military Police?

65
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:58,547
- In plainclothes on a private airstrip?
- Must have been a high-value prisoner.

66
00:04:58,886 --> 00:05:00,424
Who has now vanished.

67
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,593
Army CID will be all over this.

68
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:03,749
And so will we.

69
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:07,473
The prisoner they were transporting
was the leader of Talib Al Jihadiya.

70
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,228
The army has had
Ala A Din Keshwar all this time?

71
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:13,980
- Yeah.
- Dom was abducted

72
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,899
to exchange for this guy,
and they didn't tell us they had him?

73
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,485
There was a breakdown
in the system somewhere.

74
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:22,206
- If we'd known about this...
- It would have made no difference.

75
00:05:22,248 --> 00:05:23,656
Isn't that right, Miss Lange?

76
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:26,158
We don't negotiate with terrorists.

77
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,829
I'll get on the phone,

78
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,080
I'll cut through the bureaucracy.

79
00:05:32,122 --> 00:05:34,283
Agent Callen,
you do do what you need to do

80
00:05:35,326 --> 00:05:36,460
and find Keshwar.

81
00:05:47,738 --> 00:05:48,605
Thanks.

82
00:05:49,777 --> 00:05:51,816
Agents Callen and Hanna, NCIS.

83
00:05:51,968 --> 00:05:54,395
Major Rick Medina,
Army CID out of Washington.

84
00:05:54,827 --> 00:05:57,734
I just got an earful from my boss
who got an earful from your boss,

85
00:05:57,776 --> 00:06:00,523
meaning, I'm already prone
not to like you guys.

86
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:03,464
I'm not feeling a lot of love
for you right now either.

87
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:07,575
Where was Keshwar picked up?

88
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:10,117
Intel caught up with him
as he was leaving the Philippines.

89
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:12,455
We grabbed him
at Honolulu International.

90
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,330
And then decided not to share
that information with any other agency?

91
00:06:15,372 --> 00:06:17,170
You can bitch that one up
the flagpole.

92
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,420
It's above my pay grade,
and I don't play politics.

93
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:21,539
I deal in reality.

94
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:25,417
One agent dead, two others wounded,
one critical.

95
00:06:25,781 --> 00:06:28,429
All to free up some
Bin Laden wannabe to kill even more.

96
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,046
- Our case.
- My men.

97
00:06:30,411 --> 00:06:31,599
Our city.

98
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:34,685
- We pool what we know, then.
- Anything on the shooters?

99
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:37,688
One of them
was a ground crew supervisor,

100
00:06:38,396 --> 00:06:39,857
longtime airport employee.

101
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:41,818
The other two were newbies.

102
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,653
- Their paperwork checks out.
- What was the supervisor's name?

103
00:06:45,005 --> 00:06:46,563
- Pierce.
- First name?

104
00:06:47,085 --> 00:06:47,893
Mike.

105
00:06:48,315 --> 00:06:50,214
- Who's in charge here?
- Brosnan,

106
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:51,660
first name Susan.

107
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,954
What have you got for me?

108
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:55,632
Nothing.

109
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:58,834
Knock yourselves out.

110
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,920
Know who I'd like to knock out?

111
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,925
Like to talk to you
about Mike Pierce.

112
00:07:06,396 --> 00:07:07,451
You're his boss?

113
00:07:07,732 --> 00:07:10,012
- And operations manager.
- How well did you know him?

114
00:07:10,533 --> 00:07:12,302
I guess not as well as I thought.

115
00:07:12,642 --> 00:07:15,326
Last few days he seemed
a little distant, but...

116
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:17,781
now this...

117
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:21,314
- Hard to believe this is real.
- What about the other two?

118
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:22,983
They were new employees,

119
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,694
but I can assure you,
I had background checks done.

120
00:07:26,032 --> 00:07:28,059
Then how did Pierce know
about this flight?

121
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:30,977
Everybody knew about the flight.
Like they know about every other flight

122
00:07:31,019 --> 00:07:33,035
they need to clean and refuel...
it's their job.

123
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,496
The passenger list
is kept confidential.

124
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,789
So who told Pierce?

125
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:41,400
Judging by the glaring looks
you're giving me,

126
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:43,254
I assume you suspect that person
is me.

127
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:44,934
Was I glaring?

128
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:46,590
Thought I was squinting.

129
00:07:47,090 --> 00:07:49,657
This is one passenger list
I did not see.

130
00:07:50,002 --> 00:07:52,263
I didn't even know
it was a military flight.

131
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:55,432
Any paperwork that Pierce might have
seen that could have tipped him off?

132
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:57,912
Not that I can think of.

133
00:07:59,119 --> 00:08:02,148
People who use this facility pay
a premium for our discretion.

134
00:08:02,353 --> 00:08:04,483
Guess the army will be getting
a refund, then.

135
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,861
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

136
00:08:07,097 --> 00:08:08,573
- Is Pierce married?
- Yes.

137
00:08:08,772 --> 00:08:10,156
Then I need a home address.

138
00:08:14,347 --> 00:08:16,082
Not sure who I disliked the most,

139
00:08:16,292 --> 00:08:17,360
her or him.

140
00:08:17,806 --> 00:08:20,583
That's funny. I got the impression
you disliked them both equally.

141
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:58,330
Eric, I need an ambulance...
2724 Rushmore, now.

142
00:08:58,529 --> 00:08:59,736
Female GSW.

143
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,208
It's okay.

144
00:09:02,619 --> 00:09:04,365
It's okay. They're on their way.

145
00:09:06,299 --> 00:09:07,693
Save my husband.

146
00:09:09,603 --> 00:09:10,904
What'd she say?

147
00:09:11,572 --> 00:09:12,760
"Save my husband. "

148
00:09:26,428 --> 00:09:27,483
Thanks, Eric.

149
00:09:28,971 --> 00:09:31,327
Vance just released
Keshwar's photo to the media.

150
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:32,696
Said she should be dead.

151
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:34,387
Probably thought she was.

152
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,958
Who are "they"?

153
00:09:36,595 --> 00:09:38,535
Keshwar's people,
tying up loose ends.

154
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:41,592
LAPD's got the perimeter.

155
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:43,749
Forensic team can't get here
for at least three hours.

156
00:09:44,024 --> 00:09:46,614
- I don't have three hours.
- Good thing you've got me, then.

157
00:09:46,938 --> 00:09:48,953
You think Pierce's wife
was in on it?

158
00:09:49,575 --> 00:09:51,696
Maybe she was held captive
in her own house.

159
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:53,301
Bound, gagged

160
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:56,929
and fed nothing but yogurt, Turkey
sandwich and some sort of green tea.

161
00:09:58,068 --> 00:09:59,111
That was...

162
00:09:59,357 --> 00:10:00,447
specific.

163
00:10:06,539 --> 00:10:07,606
And true.

164
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:09,468
She was their insurance policy.

165
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,445
Make sure that Pierce followed through
with his end of the bargain.

166
00:10:13,476 --> 00:10:14,446
Which he does,

167
00:10:14,765 --> 00:10:16,383
dying in the process.

168
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,285
- Don't need her anymore.
- And they're gone.

169
00:10:20,027 --> 00:10:21,370
Question is: Where?

170
00:10:22,043 --> 00:10:23,097
The answer is:

171
00:10:23,332 --> 00:10:24,290
Anywhere.

172
00:10:24,539 --> 00:10:25,805
Or maybe not.

173
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:29,128
Not if you've lost your driver.
Mike Pierce was a pilot.

174
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:33,173
Keep looking.

175
00:10:33,441 --> 00:10:35,759
If they're not here in three hours,
I'm leaving.

176
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,803
Hooray for Hollywood.

177
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,847
Hope that means
you've found something.

178
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:41,650
They slip up.

179
00:10:41,903 --> 00:10:45,311
They always slip up. No matter
how good they think they are,

180
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:48,105
they can't escape
the all-seeing eye in the sky.

181
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:50,733
Or in this case,
the kids with the cams.

182
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:52,100
Behold...

183
00:10:54,063 --> 00:10:55,079
the van.

184
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,613
Someone watching.

185
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,495
And no license plate.

186
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,112
The shootout happened at 9:47.

187
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:04,413
And this taken
from a security camera

188
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,707
at the nearest exit
exactly two minutes later.

189
00:11:07,558 --> 00:11:09,209
No rear license plate either.

190
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,586
He picked up a passenger.

191
00:11:10,956 --> 00:11:12,216
Keshwar.

192
00:11:12,737 --> 00:11:14,298
How can we find the van?

193
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,336
Hooray for Hollywood.

194
00:11:17,378 --> 00:11:20,266
Who needs a license plate
when you've got kaleidoscope?

195
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:22,890
It's trawling through
traffic cameras as we speak.

196
00:11:23,652 --> 00:11:25,703
If they're on the road,
we'll find them.

197
00:11:25,745 --> 00:11:28,020
Meanwhile,
Keshwar's photo is running

198
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,606
on news channels and Internet feeds
all over the city.

199
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,567
And security at every airport,
train station

200
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:35,209
and bus depot is on high alert.

201
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:36,820
He's a rat in a trap.

202
00:11:37,965 --> 00:11:39,573
He's a needle in a haystack.

203
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:42,034
But it's a very distinctive needle.

204
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,235
But we don't have a warm body

205
00:11:44,277 --> 00:11:46,997
with known ties to Keshwar
or Talib al Jihadiya.

206
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:48,248
Yes, we do.

207
00:11:50,134 --> 00:11:51,070
Mowadh.

208
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:54,001
Moe has not been seen
since Dom was killed.

209
00:11:54,601 --> 00:11:56,169
It ain't for lack of trying.

210
00:11:56,757 --> 00:12:00,302
I run facial recognition for the past
five days, cross-referencing his photo

211
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,430
- with feeds from every camera.
- Your search parameters?

212
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:07,351
I started where you last saw him,
expanding the radius block by block.

213
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:10,187
Teenaged kid, all alone,
needs to hide out, where do you go?

214
00:12:10,484 --> 00:12:11,524
The streets.

215
00:12:12,887 --> 00:12:15,228
You figure out pretty quickly
where the other kids go.

216
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,555
Hollywood, Santa Monica, Venice.

217
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:20,323
Moe always said
the beach made him feel small.

218
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:22,699
Might think it's a good place
to get lost.

219
00:12:23,502 --> 00:12:26,439
Change your search parameter.
Start in Venice, work your way east.

220
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:28,330
What are you thinking?

221
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,290
Two needles in the haystack.

222
00:12:34,256 --> 00:12:35,658
I don't care if you...

223
00:12:36,232 --> 00:12:37,052
Fine.

224
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:38,977
Sooner than later, I hope.

225
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,057
Thank you.

226
00:12:41,099 --> 00:12:41,979
Damn it.

227
00:12:42,521 --> 00:12:44,430
The proverbial sound of someone

228
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,070
tightrope walking across red tape.

229
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:48,995
And falling.

230
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:52,563
I want to know why we were left
in the dark on this Keshwar business.

231
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,565
That would be beneficial.
We seem

232
00:12:54,649 --> 00:12:58,360
to be doing all the quid
without any benefit of the pro quo.

233
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:00,737
I keep you uprise.

234
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:03,106
You seem to be afraid

235
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,284
to speak with me privately,

236
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:07,161
knowing damn well

237
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:09,913
that I won't do this
in front of my coworkers.

238
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:12,619
Smart.

239
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,171
But ultimately ineffective.

240
00:13:18,712 --> 00:13:22,447
I've suffered a lot of losses
over the years, Leon. We all have.

241
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:27,266
But the loss of one of my agents,

242
00:13:28,585 --> 00:13:30,273
I cannot withstand.

243
00:13:31,141 --> 00:13:34,013
Agent Sullivan was my first,
and, I swore,

244
00:13:34,544 --> 00:13:35,696
my last.

245
00:13:36,972 --> 00:13:39,362
But swearing seems to have proven

246
00:13:40,002 --> 00:13:41,439
a hollow gesture.

247
00:13:42,582 --> 00:13:44,615
And I'm left with no choice.

248
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:51,028
I thought I'd save Uncle Sam
the postage.

249
00:13:51,946 --> 00:13:53,540
My letter of resignation.

250
00:14:04,357 --> 00:14:05,719
This isn't over, Hetty.

251
00:14:06,743 --> 00:14:09,056
I'm afraid for me, it is, Leon.

252
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:21,121
You're being way too quiet, amigo.

253
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,183
If you don't do
or say something worthy

254
00:14:28,225 --> 00:14:30,629
of my sarcastic ridicule
in the next ten seconds,

255
00:14:31,214 --> 00:14:33,749
I'll play nothing but show tunes
in the car from now on.

256
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,639
And don't think I won't do it.

257
00:14:38,324 --> 00:14:39,670
You should talk to Nate.

258
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:43,882
Or you could talk to me.

259
00:14:44,608 --> 00:14:46,117
What is there to say?

260
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:47,830
Oh, I don't know.

261
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,157
That you feel responsible
for Dom's death.

262
00:14:54,721 --> 00:14:56,713
Maybe if you'd trained him better,

263
00:14:57,035 --> 00:14:58,689
he might not have been abducted.

264
00:15:01,798 --> 00:15:03,818
Maybe if you got there
a few seconds earlier,

265
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,313
he might still be alive.

266
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:08,993
See?

267
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:11,938
What's there to say?

268
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:17,645
And then I could say that...

269
00:15:19,125 --> 00:15:21,222
you need to stop thinking that way.

270
00:15:21,843 --> 00:15:23,507
That you did all that you could do.

271
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:26,758
That Dom's death particularly sucks,

272
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,303
cause he was so young
and didn't deserve it.

273
00:15:33,385 --> 00:15:35,951
You'd probably say something
about losing people before,

274
00:15:37,076 --> 00:15:39,842
and I think we'd both agree
that it never gets any easier.

275
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:49,107
You might also say that you're sad.

276
00:15:52,168 --> 00:15:53,252
You know what?

277
00:15:54,472 --> 00:15:55,503
I am, too.

278
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:04,004
You had to play the show tunes card?

279
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,801
<i>Guys, I found a needle.</i>

280
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,026
Which one?

281
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,338
Moe.

282
00:16:15,736 --> 00:16:16,475
Moe!

283
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:17,809
Wait! Moe!

284
00:16:18,172 --> 00:16:19,019
Wait!

285
00:16:31,277 --> 00:16:32,824
Moe, put the knife down.

286
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:34,280
Stay away!

287
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:35,994
We know you're tired, Moe.

288
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:37,796
And a little scared.

289
00:16:38,628 --> 00:16:40,707
We also know
you tried to help our agent.

290
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,046
You gave him a key, didn't you?

291
00:16:43,656 --> 00:16:44,945
So he could get away.

292
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:47,535
He make it?

293
00:16:51,941 --> 00:16:52,886
Come on, Moe.

294
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,556
Come on.

295
00:17:06,103 --> 00:17:07,521
Hands behind your head.

296
00:17:40,497 --> 00:17:43,061
You're into some pretty serious stuff.
You know that, Moe?

297
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,315
Is he going to roll over?

298
00:17:47,538 --> 00:17:50,086
If he is, Sam's our best shot.

299
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:52,779
Is your head clear?

300
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:55,240
'Cause I need you in the game, man.

301
00:17:57,526 --> 00:17:59,035
I'm sorry about your friend.

302
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:03,690
They told me no one would be hurt.

303
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:05,375
You believed them?

304
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:06,994
I believed a lot.

305
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:09,975
But now...

306
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:13,175
I believe in nothing.

307
00:18:18,534 --> 00:18:19,530
Did you do it?

308
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:21,573
Do what?

309
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:24,603
Verify procedure?

310
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:26,460
File reports?

311
00:18:28,327 --> 00:18:31,421
You know that there was never
any suggestion of any wrongdoing

312
00:18:31,463 --> 00:18:33,653
regarding Agent Vail
on anyone's part.

313
00:18:34,386 --> 00:18:35,906
So why are you here, Director?

314
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,370
I'm here to see
how you guys are doing.

315
00:18:39,318 --> 00:18:40,076
So?

316
00:18:41,005 --> 00:18:42,247
We're doing okay.

317
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:44,664
And Hetty?

318
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:47,942
You know Hetty.

319
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,127
She doesn't just keep things
close to the vest.

320
00:18:52,169 --> 00:18:55,050
She actually sews them in the vest
and covers it with Kevlar.

321
00:18:55,971 --> 00:18:58,209
I actually thought
she'd take it worse.

322
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:02,202
Especially considering what happened
in '99 with Agent Sullivan.

323
00:19:05,624 --> 00:19:06,978
Maybe this time's different.

324
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:13,660
I hope so.

325
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:19,407
This place would fall apart
without Hetty.

326
00:19:26,322 --> 00:19:27,435
That it would.

327
00:19:28,948 --> 00:19:30,502
<i>Why should I help you?</i>

328
00:19:32,276 --> 00:19:34,506
<i>You did the right thing
helping my friend.</i>

329
00:19:37,292 --> 00:19:38,862
Turning your back on them.

330
00:19:39,075 --> 00:19:40,303
It took courage.

331
00:19:40,962 --> 00:19:43,306
Did it take courage for you
to kill my father?

332
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:48,497
Taking any life

333
00:19:49,525 --> 00:19:50,647
takes courage, Moe.

334
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,353
You must know
there's no other choice.

335
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:57,111
Was there no other choice?

336
00:20:00,337 --> 00:20:02,271
Your father was pointing
a gun at me.

337
00:20:09,611 --> 00:20:11,126
Now you have to make a choice.

338
00:20:13,338 --> 00:20:15,589
You can help me find
Ala a Din Keshwar.

339
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:17,757
- So you can kill him, too?
- No.

340
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:20,886
So I can stop him
killing other innocent people.

341
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:25,140
Will you help me, Moe?

342
00:20:28,622 --> 00:20:29,686
Will you help me?

343
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,397
Okay, Pierce,
let's see what you're hiding.

344
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:15,023
It's just me. It's just me.

345
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:17,359
You want to get yourself shot?

346
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:19,235
Sorry.
Should have called out.

347
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:22,757
Maybe we should have a password
or something.

348
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,961
You know, like,
I say flash, you say thunder.

349
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,559
Something like that.

350
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,246
We don't have to;
it's not really a good idea.

351
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,124
- What are you doing here?
- Thought you could use some company.

352
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,418
You know,
checking out Pierce's garage.

353
00:21:36,407 --> 00:21:37,811
Extra set of eyes.

354
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:40,600
- It's cool.
- Yeah.

355
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,011
Proverbial man cave.

356
00:21:43,411 --> 00:21:44,929
Such a cliché.

357
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:46,592
"I need space. "

358
00:21:46,893 --> 00:21:49,591
Is it bad that mine consists
of a bean bag chair,

359
00:21:49,633 --> 00:21:51,418
cases of Otter Pops,

360
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:54,463
and Steven Seagal's entire
oeuvre on DVD?

361
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:58,984
Men.
They always find a way to leave you.

362
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,777
Thinking about Dom?

363
00:22:00,927 --> 00:22:04,283
Dom, my father,
my ex-boyfriend, my old partner.

364
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,786
That's quite a body count, huh?

365
00:22:08,819 --> 00:22:10,647
We all lose people we care about.

366
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:12,956
I know.
I'm a textbook example, right?

367
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:16,751
Girl who can't commit,
because every man in her life dies.

368
00:22:18,196 --> 00:22:20,392
No.
You're just human, Kensi.

369
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:23,279
It's only natural to be struck by...

370
00:22:23,321 --> 00:22:27,262
This a World War II fighter plane.
The P-38 Lightning.

371
00:22:28,908 --> 00:22:29,973
And...?

372
00:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,392
This side of the wall
is devoted to cars.

373
00:22:32,617 --> 00:22:34,019
The other side to planes.

374
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,396
This, my friend,
is on the wrong side.

375
00:22:36,808 --> 00:22:39,474
This is the biggest photo here.
Maybe...

376
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:41,499
he just wanted
to feature it prominently?

377
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:42,712
Or maybe...

378
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:45,710
he wanted to hide something.

379
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:56,666
Whoa, careful.
It might be a stash of por...

380
00:22:58,341 --> 00:22:59,397
Nothing.

381
00:23:05,478 --> 00:23:07,469
Must be at least $50,000 here.

382
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:14,851
It's a flight plan.

383
00:23:14,996 --> 00:23:16,811
Fuel burn rates, heights.

384
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:18,813
Low and fast into Mexico.

385
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:20,648
Pierce was in on it.

386
00:23:20,921 --> 00:23:21,983
I was right.

387
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:23,985
Keshwar lost his driver.

388
00:23:30,925 --> 00:23:32,086
You got a moment?

389
00:23:35,909 --> 00:23:38,374
I thought that was
pretty self-explanatory.

390
00:23:38,689 --> 00:23:40,510
Well, the words are clear, yeah.

391
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:43,042
The sentiment is valid.

392
00:23:45,045 --> 00:23:48,236
It's as clear and valid as it was
in 1999 when it was written.

393
00:23:50,489 --> 00:23:53,118
This is the exact same letter
of resignation you turned

394
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,142
in when Agent Sullivan was killed.
You just changed the date.

395
00:23:56,767 --> 00:23:58,263
Penciled in a new one.

396
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:00,438
Hetty, this is unacceptable.

397
00:24:00,619 --> 00:24:01,914
Unacceptable?

398
00:24:01,956 --> 00:24:03,316
- Yes.
- No, Leon.

399
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:06,111
But you want to know what is?

400
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,353
I choose these people,

401
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,820
and I assess them,

402
00:24:12,586 --> 00:24:13,743
I train them.

403
00:24:13,956 --> 00:24:17,956
I put time and stock
and heart in them,

404
00:24:18,453 --> 00:24:20,333
and they die,

405
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:24,820
proving one thing
I always suspected:

406
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,593
That I am not cut out for this job.

407
00:24:31,207 --> 00:24:34,389
Hetty, you're more cut out for this job
than anybody I've ever worked with.

408
00:24:34,672 --> 00:24:37,431
I was never, ever, cut out for this.

409
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,853
I just happened
to have the capacity for it.

410
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,977
<i>Hey, Hetty,
is Director Vance still there?</i>

411
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:50,905
He is.

412
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,240
<i>We found the van.</i>

413
00:24:55,898 --> 00:24:57,203
Eric found the van.

414
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,177
You in the van,
this is Major Medina, Army CID!

415
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:13,913
How the hell did they beat us here?

416
00:25:13,955 --> 00:25:16,215
They get too aggressive,
they can blow everything.

417
00:25:16,567 --> 00:25:19,100
Callen! Sam!
Nate! Stay with the car.

418
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:21,076
Throw your weapons out the window,

419
00:25:21,118 --> 00:25:23,146
get out of the vehicle
and down on the ground!

420
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,812
Keshwar could be in there.

421
00:25:24,854 --> 00:25:27,375
On my signal,
we go in hot and heavy.

422
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:30,349
Final warning:
Hands where I can see them!

423
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:34,194
Get out of the vehicle
and get down on the ground now!

424
00:25:36,005 --> 00:25:38,612
Medina, pull your men back.
You don't know these guys.

425
00:25:38,654 --> 00:25:39,997
But they don't know us.

426
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,066
They do not kill my men
and get away with it.

427
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,293
Oh, boy.

428
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,170
You want to sit this one out, fine.

429
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,090
- We'll take them.
- Callen, they're praying.

430
00:25:49,132 --> 00:25:50,840
My men, my op.
Sam, they're praying.

431
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,550
- Get ready.
- Pull back!

432
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,302
- Pull back!
- Get away from the van!

433
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,888
Everyone get way from the van!
Pull back! Pull back! Let's go!

434
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,235
- They're martyrs.
- G, got to go! Got to go!

435
00:25:59,326 --> 00:26:00,853
- Pull back!
- Come on!

436
00:26:01,034 --> 00:26:02,311
<i>Allah Akbah.</i>

437
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,251
Allah Akbah.

438
00:26:35,293 --> 00:26:36,806
I almost lost three men.

439
00:26:37,735 --> 00:26:38,554
Four.

440
00:26:39,366 --> 00:26:41,182
I'm not sure mine's worth counting.

441
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:45,436
We'll post up the bodies,
see what we can turn up.

442
00:26:45,652 --> 00:26:48,907
Well, at least Keshwar's out of
the picture, and TAJ's back is broken.

443
00:26:49,235 --> 00:26:50,775
I wouldn't jump to that conclusion.

444
00:26:51,322 --> 00:26:54,332
You just let me know when
I can close the book on this guy.

445
00:26:56,387 --> 00:26:57,967
You think he's in there?

446
00:26:59,066 --> 00:27:01,703
Maybe they want us to think that,
so we give up the hunt.

447
00:27:05,011 --> 00:27:06,029
Dom?

448
00:27:07,374 --> 00:27:08,419
Moe.

449
00:27:10,366 --> 00:27:11,879
Keshwar wasn't in the van.

450
00:27:25,412 --> 00:27:27,620
We all have to believe
in something, Moe.

451
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,441
But first we have to have the courage
to believe in ourselves.

452
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:41,017
A van blew up this afternoon.

453
00:27:45,359 --> 00:27:46,622
Will you help me?

454
00:28:01,005 --> 00:28:02,399
Okay, what do we know?

455
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:05,859
We know Mike Pierce was working
for Ala a Din Keshwar.

456
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:08,076
Yeah, which means,
Keshwar's men paid off Pierce,

457
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:11,118
- but they held his wife captive.
- Maybe Pierce was getting cold feet.

458
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,068
Realized it'sabout to help a terrorist.
They wanted himthrough with it.

459
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:16,685
But it all went south when
Mike Pierce was killed at the airport.

460
00:28:16,854 --> 00:28:20,235
Which means, if he hasn't got a backup
plan, Keshwar's probably gone to ground.

461
00:28:20,277 --> 00:28:23,319
Showed Moe the photos. All 3 of the men
in the van were from the youth center.

462
00:28:23,361 --> 00:28:24,384
He knew them all.

463
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:26,747
Moe said one of them had
a brother here in Los Angeles.

464
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,717
- His name is Tarik Hassan.
- Eric?

465
00:28:28,759 --> 00:28:29,783
On it.

466
00:28:35,525 --> 00:28:37,673
All right.
He's on a terrorist watch list.

467
00:28:37,807 --> 00:28:39,425
Last known whereabouts, Sudan.

468
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:40,968
That's one of the shooters.

469
00:28:41,576 --> 00:28:43,513
Operations manager Susan Brosnan.

470
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:46,182
She told us she performed
background checks on both men.

471
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,615
There is no way this guy would
have been cleared to work at an airport

472
00:28:49,657 --> 00:28:52,302
- anywhere.
- So she rubber-stamped him in.

473
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:53,648
Looked the other way.

474
00:28:55,691 --> 00:28:57,555
So, you think I helped that man?

475
00:28:57,844 --> 00:28:59,828
Do I look like a terrorist to you?

476
00:29:00,169 --> 00:29:01,199
Terrorist?

477
00:29:01,493 --> 00:29:02,514
No.

478
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:04,242
An opportunist? Yes.

479
00:29:06,106 --> 00:29:08,079
Bet you got a nice paycheck,
too, huh?

480
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:10,415
Look, I swear, I don't know
what you're talking about.

481
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:12,306
You can swear all you want,

482
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:15,878
but right now, our agency
is turning your life upside down.

483
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:17,547
It doesn't matter how they paid you.

484
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:19,549
We'll find out.

485
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:20,947
Or...

486
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,542
you can make it easier on yourself.

487
00:29:34,638 --> 00:29:36,292
Okay, wait! Wait.

488
00:29:37,572 --> 00:29:40,086
Look, I work
for very wealthy clients,

489
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:41,174
and...

490
00:29:41,851 --> 00:29:45,120
I'm often given cash
in return for favors.

491
00:29:45,593 --> 00:29:47,577
- What kind of favors?
- You know,...

492
00:29:47,661 --> 00:29:50,453
like stocking the plane
with a-a certain food,

493
00:29:50,657 --> 00:29:52,254
or drink, or...

494
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:55,209
party girls looking for a good time.

495
00:29:56,173 --> 00:29:57,846
You name it, I've done it.

496
00:29:58,828 --> 00:30:01,559
Someone asked me
to give those men a job.

497
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:04,802
- Supplied me with their paperwork.
- Who asked you?

498
00:30:06,842 --> 00:30:08,715
I never saw anyone face-to-face.

499
00:30:08,757 --> 00:30:10,880
It was a...
It was a voice on the phone

500
00:30:10,922 --> 00:30:13,223
or an envelope waiting for me.

501
00:30:13,265 --> 00:30:14,437
I- I don't know.

502
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,588
- You mean, you didn't want to know.
- It was a lot of money.

503
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:20,395
It's too bad you won't be able
to spend it.

504
00:30:33,317 --> 00:30:34,770
You spring cleaning?

505
00:30:36,266 --> 00:30:38,208
Call it what you will, Mr. Callen.

506
00:30:43,548 --> 00:30:45,765
- That's your diary.
- Certainly is.

507
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,097
You don't spring-clean your diary.

508
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:53,426
- Are we moving?
- No.

509
00:30:54,095 --> 00:30:55,544
Are you moving?

510
00:30:59,255 --> 00:31:00,775
You didn't get fired, did you?

511
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,036
Certainly not.

512
00:31:05,804 --> 00:31:07,170
You're not...

513
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:09,508
quitting?

514
00:31:12,865 --> 00:31:14,664
Resigning.
It's different.

515
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:16,457
Not from where I'm standing.

516
00:31:20,657 --> 00:31:22,129
Oh, Mr. Callen,

517
00:31:23,056 --> 00:31:25,508
I've been through a lot,
decades of a lot.

518
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:27,885
And at some point, you realize

519
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:30,763
there are remote islands
you'd like to visit.

520
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,235
Novels to lose yourself to.

521
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:36,323
Culinary delights to fatten up on.

522
00:31:40,255 --> 00:31:42,645
Never thought
I'd hear you rationalize.

523
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:50,866
If you feel the need to take the blame
for Dom's death, Hetty,

524
00:31:52,814 --> 00:31:54,287
you'll have to stand in line.

525
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:58,143
You are gravely mistaken
if you think

526
00:31:59,303 --> 00:32:02,057
I would let the death of one agent

527
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:05,648
influence my occupational choices.

528
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,216
But you are.

529
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:15,600
That's one of the things
I love about you.

530
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:29,051
Don't do this.

531
00:32:32,755 --> 00:32:33,728
I'm afraid

532
00:32:35,462 --> 00:32:36,586
my decision

533
00:32:37,455 --> 00:32:38,497
is final,

534
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:40,701
Mr. Callen.

535
00:33:05,853 --> 00:33:07,833
So Keshwar loses his ride to Mexico,

536
00:33:07,875 --> 00:33:09,612
and he can't risk public transport.

537
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:11,322
Steal a car, cross at the border.

538
00:33:11,747 --> 00:33:12,657
Too risky.

539
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:14,450
Pay to be smuggled across, then.

540
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,285
Takes time and contacts.

541
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,804
He's obviously well-funded.

542
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,375
So... who else could he pay off
to get him out of the country?

543
00:33:23,908 --> 00:33:26,128
Same people you pay off
to get you into the country.

544
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:34,183
When you left the country
and hooked up

545
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:36,430
with Talib al Jihadiya,
how did you get back in?

546
00:33:37,113 --> 00:33:38,231
On a ship.

547
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:40,769
I traveled from Sudan,

548
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,019
boarded in Egypt.

549
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,259
What kind of ship?

550
00:33:44,243 --> 00:33:45,444
A cargo ship.

551
00:33:46,346 --> 00:33:47,672
You remember the name?

552
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,277
Was it flying a flag?

553
00:33:51,106 --> 00:33:52,383
Yes. The flag.

554
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,643
It was...

555
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:55,980
red.

556
00:33:56,456 --> 00:33:58,706
Had a moon on it and a star.

557
00:33:59,573 --> 00:34:00,663
Turkish flag.

558
00:34:02,878 --> 00:34:06,085
Maybe Keshwar's trying to get out
the same way he got Moe in.

559
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:09,797
Port of Los Angeles.

560
00:34:10,161 --> 00:34:11,914
Cargo ships that arrived
ten days ago

561
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:13,884
flying the Turkish flag.
I need it now.

562
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,394
Okay, six Turkish registered ships
on the current

563
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,979
Harbor Commission list.

564
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,424
Three arrived in the past four days.

565
00:34:27,466 --> 00:34:29,650
Two arrived more than two weeks ago.

566
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,465
Got it.

567
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:31,819
The Hamideh.

568
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:33,446
Arrived ten days ago.

569
00:34:34,054 --> 00:34:36,198
Uh-oh. It's scheduled to depart
within the hour.

570
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,194
<i>Where, Eric?</i>

571
00:34:37,382 --> 00:34:39,280
Berth 403.
You want backup?

572
00:34:39,444 --> 00:34:40,476
<i>No time.</i>

573
00:34:41,096 --> 00:34:42,455
Put Army CID in the loop.

574
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,092
There she is.

575
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,716
A guard on the gangway.
Probably more on each deck.

576
00:34:54,373 --> 00:34:56,599
- I'll take Kensi.
- Right behind you.

577
00:34:59,001 --> 00:34:59,805
Hair.

578
00:35:00,748 --> 00:35:02,183
What are we supposed to be?

579
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:03,006
Drunk.

580
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:10,274
- Don't judge me.
- I wouldn't think of it.

581
00:35:20,094 --> 00:35:21,577
Where are you're going?

582
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:23,530
Just going to our stateroom,
thank you.

583
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:26,167
You've got the wrong place.

584
00:35:26,847 --> 00:35:28,939
I paid good money
for this cruise, okay?

585
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:30,884
I paid pretty good money
for her, too.

586
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:36,616
Save that for the stateroom.

587
00:35:39,194 --> 00:35:41,467
This is not your cruise ship.

588
00:35:46,932 --> 00:35:47,812
Yes, it is.

589
00:35:56,816 --> 00:35:58,081
Worth every penny.

590
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:23,097
Keshwar.

591
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,265
We know he's here.

592
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,391
Take us to him.

593
00:36:25,625 --> 00:36:26,934
You'll have to kill me.

594
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,290
I won't kill you.

595
00:36:28,332 --> 00:36:31,438
I'll just blind you and paralyze you.
Make you wish you were dead.

596
00:36:31,678 --> 00:36:32,873
Let me ask again.

597
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,393
Where is he?

598
00:36:35,713 --> 00:36:36,569
The bow.

599
00:36:41,072 --> 00:36:41,907
The bow.

600
00:36:48,229 --> 00:36:49,788
G, the upper deck!

601
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:57,316
Federal agents. Stop!

602
00:37:27,436 --> 00:37:29,705
- Who else is shooting?
- Maybe we got backup?

603
00:37:30,527 --> 00:37:32,215
Hands behind your back now!

604
00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:33,459
Federal agents!

605
00:37:33,657 --> 00:37:35,708
Medina. CID.
We got him.

606
00:37:39,026 --> 00:37:40,503
Thanks for the diversion.

607
00:37:41,112 --> 00:37:42,237
The diversion?

608
00:37:49,021 --> 00:37:51,393
Men dying all around him,
and he slinks away like a rat.

609
00:37:51,478 --> 00:37:52,519
Not this time.

610
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:53,967
This is our guy, Medina.

611
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:55,070
No way.

612
00:37:55,690 --> 00:37:57,375
We caught him.
We deliver him.

613
00:37:57,417 --> 00:38:00,110
- I got a backup team on the way.
- Who told you he was here?

614
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,128
Your boss.
Thank him for me.

615
00:38:08,446 --> 00:38:10,329
Eric, let me talk to Vance.

616
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,542
Has Army CID
been briefed on this op?

617
00:38:15,722 --> 00:38:18,504
In the interests of joint operational
intelligence, yes, they have.

618
00:38:19,117 --> 00:38:22,281
<i>I told Major Medina that Keshwar
was being held on a Turkish ship.</i>

619
00:38:22,492 --> 00:38:23,828
He beat us to it.

620
00:38:24,097 --> 00:38:26,043
Medina
<i>just took Keshwar into custody.</i>

621
00:38:26,635 --> 00:38:28,055
I didn't say which ship.

622
00:38:28,381 --> 00:38:31,229
<i>Medina never gave me the chance.
He hung up before I could tell him</i>

623
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:45,280
- Just want to know what it felt like.
- What did what feel like?

624
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:46,277
That moment

625
00:38:46,805 --> 00:38:49,284
when you went from protecting
your country to betraying it.

626
00:38:49,591 --> 00:38:51,782
I'm not sure I know
what you're saying, Callen.

627
00:38:51,824 --> 00:38:53,372
Why you didn't want us on the case.

628
00:38:53,571 --> 00:38:55,868
Why you were so determined
to storm that van.

629
00:38:56,977 --> 00:38:59,169
You wanted them dead
so they couldn't identify you.

630
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:02,602
You were helping Keshwar all along.

631
00:39:04,135 --> 00:39:06,244
Tell me it was just for the money.

632
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:08,740
It was.

633
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:11,056
It is.

634
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,519
Shoot him.

635
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:19,612
You know
I can't go with you, Callen.

636
00:39:21,424 --> 00:39:23,076
You can't shoot all three of us.

637
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:24,944
I can try.

638
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,586
It is over.

639
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,162
So...

640
00:39:59,641 --> 00:40:00,981
what happens now?

641
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:03,192
You're going to be placed
under arrest.

642
00:40:04,628 --> 00:40:07,710
You made a choice to join TAJ.
There are consequences.

643
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,865
But you tried to help Dom.

644
00:40:10,792 --> 00:40:12,284
You helped us find Keshwar.

645
00:40:13,272 --> 00:40:14,714
That counts for something.

646
00:40:15,651 --> 00:40:16,789
I brought you here.

647
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:20,667
When you were seven years old.

648
00:40:22,492 --> 00:40:24,046
You remember what I told you?

649
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:28,914
I am your brother.

650
00:40:30,871 --> 00:40:32,207
You are my brother.

651
00:40:33,508 --> 00:40:34,539
That's right.

652
00:40:36,422 --> 00:40:37,722
I'm still your brother.

653
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:41,578
And I yours.

654
00:40:59,647 --> 00:41:00,783
Director Vance.

655
00:41:01,111 --> 00:41:02,893
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

656
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,295
I'm headed back to D.C.

657
00:41:05,752 --> 00:41:08,031
I'm setting up interviews
for Hetty's replacement

658
00:41:08,073 --> 00:41:10,176
if you'd like to be considered
for the position.

659
00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:12,226
Thank you.

660
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:14,346
I'm very happy where I am.

661
00:41:14,898 --> 00:41:16,263
Then I'll be in touch.

662
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:18,977
Take care.

663
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,454
A toast?

664
00:41:29,765 --> 00:41:32,156
To your... pending retirement?

665
00:41:34,044 --> 00:41:35,749
A symbolic libation.

666
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:39,675
So, you're not mad at me?

667
00:41:44,351 --> 00:41:46,027
Because I realized something.

668
00:41:46,753 --> 00:41:48,380
I'm actually jealous of you.

669
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,924
Now, you get to relax,

670
00:41:51,552 --> 00:41:54,646
sleep in late, have long lunches
with your friends,

671
00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:57,497
play canasta
until your fingers bleed.

672
00:41:57,683 --> 00:41:59,683
Now you're toying with me.

673
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:03,061
Save your whiskey and your breath.

674
00:42:03,245 --> 00:42:06,440
Vance already has
my letter of resignation.

675
00:42:10,275 --> 00:42:11,528
You mean this one?

676
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:16,709
Where did you get that?
Did Vance give that to you?

677
00:42:16,849 --> 00:42:18,068
No, not exactly.

678
00:42:19,497 --> 00:42:21,056
You know, you can take the...

679
00:42:21,098 --> 00:42:22,813
the kid off the-the street, but...

680
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:28,260
Did I mention the canasta?

681
00:42:40,618 --> 00:42:42,142
.: Team UnderCovers :.

682
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,936
Hell.

683
00:42:44,615 --> 00:42:46,631
Better make it a double.
