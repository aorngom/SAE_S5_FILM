1
00:00:32,915 --> 00:00:34,043
I said no!

2
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,504
What's this guy doing?

3
00:00:37,193 --> 00:00:38,412
Look out!

4
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:43,510
- Stay here!
- No!

5
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:44,901
Stay here.

6
00:00:49,164 --> 00:00:50,365
Son of a...

7
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,262
What the hell, man?
What's wrong with...?

8
00:00:56,927 --> 00:00:58,231
Open the door.

9
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:01,102
Open the door!
Wake up!

10
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,979
Come on, man, open the door!

11
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:03,938
Wake up!

12
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,364
Open the door!

13
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,609
Get him out of the car!

14
00:01:09,774 --> 00:01:10,960
It's gonna go!

15
00:01:17,667 --> 00:01:21,657
.: Team UnderCovers :.

16
00:01:31,258 --> 00:01:33,727
NCIS Los Angeles 1x20
- Fame -

17
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,309
You know what young say
they want to be when they grow up?

18
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:43,639
Probably not a Navy SEAL.

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,468
Not a teacher, not an astronaut
or anything that requires effort.

20
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:49,636
All kids want to be is famous.

21
00:01:50,058 --> 00:01:51,593
And girls just want to have fun.

22
00:01:51,635 --> 00:01:53,527
15 minutes of fame is nothing new.

23
00:01:53,569 --> 00:01:54,828
Morning, guys.

24
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:56,410
Morning, Nate.

25
00:01:56,738 --> 00:01:58,988
- Good workout?
- Yes, maxed out the delts...

26
00:01:59,030 --> 00:02:00,536
feeling that.
And my glutes...

27
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:02,997
keeping my glutes in shape.

28
00:02:03,459 --> 00:02:06,974
A guy carves a ten-foot-tall human
out of stone and buries it,

29
00:02:07,326 --> 00:02:10,004
then he discovers a petrified giant.

30
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,752
The media has a frenzy,
people come from all over.

31
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:15,729
A story of instant celebrity from...
drum roll...

32
00:02:16,467 --> 00:02:17,786
1868.

33
00:02:18,369 --> 00:02:20,014
There's a sucker born every minute.

34
00:02:20,232 --> 00:02:23,150
Actually, Barnum never even said
the famous quotation

35
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:26,701
Barnum made a second stone giant.
Then the guy who owned the first one

36
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:29,398
said people who saw Barnum's giant
were suckers.

37
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:32,608
Yeah, so we celebrate Barnum
for a quote he never said

38
00:02:32,796 --> 00:02:34,460
about a phony replica of a

39
00:02:34,882 --> 00:02:36,197
crackpot hoax.

40
00:02:40,917 --> 00:02:41,995
Well, well.

41
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:45,019
Callen. Doc.

42
00:02:45,617 --> 00:02:47,011
Sorry. Little sore in

43
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,085
- the delts.
- But the glutes are good.

44
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,796
- You heard that?
- I did.

45
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,090
- Sam.
- That desk is taken, Deeks.

46
00:02:54,273 --> 00:02:55,668
You can't sit there.

47
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:57,635
Excuse me.

48
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,398
Mr. Hanna,
I asked Detective Deeks to sit there.

49
00:03:05,699 --> 00:03:07,316
I did so politely.

50
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:10,147
Detective Deeks has been appointed

51
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,177
our LAPD liaison,

52
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:14,685
filling a chair that,

53
00:03:15,142 --> 00:03:16,185
though taken,

54
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:18,498
has been vacant for some time.

55
00:03:18,815 --> 00:03:20,032
Welcome aboard, Deeks.

56
00:03:20,302 --> 00:03:21,122
Thanks.

57
00:03:21,943 --> 00:03:23,396
So you're sort of a temp.

58
00:03:24,521 --> 00:03:26,079
Temp. Yeah, I like that.

59
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:28,749
See, with cops, having
a negative nickname's a good thing.

60
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,170
No time to waste.
We have a case.

61
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,181
Deeks?
Really?

62
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,747
Really.
LAPD liaison.

63
00:03:37,887 --> 00:03:39,597
That's the best they could do?

64
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:43,535
And...

65
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:46,816
- it's the best they can do.
- Sorry.

66
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,130
Forgiven.

67
00:03:48,503 --> 00:03:49,562
 What do you got?

68
00:03:51,311 --> 00:03:52,495
Lieutenant Brian Roth

69
00:03:52,537 --> 00:03:55,943
sailed a car off Mulholland early
this morning with two bullets in him.

70
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:58,776
Eyewitness says he was still alive
when he went over.

71
00:03:58,928 --> 00:03:59,702
But...

72
00:04:00,709 --> 00:04:01,963
he's not anymore.

73
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,424
- The car wasn't his.
- Whose was it?

74
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,287
Belongs to Aubrey Darva.

75
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,830
The Aubrey Darva?

76
00:04:10,685 --> 00:04:13,461
Aubrey's vying for the socialite tiara.
Trying to out-Paris

77
00:04:13,545 --> 00:04:16,064
Paris Hilton
and out-Kim the Kardashians.

78
00:04:16,404 --> 00:04:19,451
Photo on the right taken
just last night. Posted on ZMZ.

79
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:21,802
Famous for being famous.

80
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,638
Welcome to Los Angeles.
The point is,

81
00:04:23,722 --> 00:04:26,108
she wouldn't be hanging out
with a sailor. More likely,

82
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,514
this guy stole her car.

83
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,978
- Was it reported stolen?
- No. Not yet.

84
00:04:30,212 --> 00:04:31,771
Roth was at the top of his class

85
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:33,681
at Annapolis
with a flawless service record.

86
00:04:33,723 --> 00:04:36,859
- I wouldn't call him a nobody.
- To her, he's a nobody. Not my opinion.

87
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,676
Let's get up there
and tell the LAPD we're interested.

88
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:41,656
Good thing we have a liaison.

89
00:04:43,509 --> 00:04:44,646
Good thing.

90
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,343
Okay, Eric,

91
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,697
as soon as you find out,
let me know.

92
00:05:00,053 --> 00:05:01,937
Time to do your liaison thing.

93
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:04,470
Yeah, about that liaise thing.

94
00:05:07,028 --> 00:05:08,766
What's the wait?
The car's coming up.

95
00:05:09,325 --> 00:05:11,310
- He doesn't want to.
- Doesn't want to what?

96
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,437
- Liaise.
- Is that even a word?

97
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:16,440
Yes. A liaison liaises.

98
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:18,717
Well, maybe you can demonstrate.

99
00:05:22,432 --> 00:05:23,322
Thanks.

100
00:05:25,877 --> 00:05:27,647
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

101
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:30,553
I feel like a mom dropping off her kid,
first day of school.

102
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,705
Guys, how's it going?

103
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,310
Beat it.

104
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:39,812
Appreciate the help.
Doesn't look like a very warm reception.

105
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:41,257
We done?

106
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,968
They told me... you don't need to know
what they told me.

107
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:45,219
Is it our crime scene?

108
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,887
Conversation never got that far.

109
00:05:47,404 --> 00:05:48,575
Leave it to me.

110
00:05:50,146 --> 00:05:53,810
Undercover cops. I've pissed off
more than my fair share of shields.

111
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,564
- Why'd they choose you as our liaison?
- Hetty's request.

112
00:05:56,866 --> 00:05:57,874
Thank you.

113
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,839
Our case, our crime scene.

114
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:04,905
You're okay, too, Deeks,

115
00:06:05,089 --> 00:06:06,355
if you're with us.

116
00:06:06,706 --> 00:06:07,866
Let's go, Temp.

117
00:06:13,444 --> 00:06:14,698
Two gunshots...

118
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,303
shoulder, ribs.

119
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,093
This guy would've bled out
even without the crash.

120
00:06:19,491 --> 00:06:21,096
There's blood on the door handle.

121
00:06:21,753 --> 00:06:23,886
Means he got shot
before he got in the car.

122
00:06:24,237 --> 00:06:25,854
Need to find that crime scene.

123
00:06:26,745 --> 00:06:29,555
There's a door-stamp for Balm.
That's the hottest club in Hollywood.

124
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,889
So Roth was there.
Something happens

125
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:34,018
that puts him in Aubrey's car
and gets him shot.

126
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,928
Balm isn't just socialite central
for the Aubrey Darvas of the world.

127
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,689
A lot of bad guys
hanging out there, too.

128
00:06:40,502 --> 00:06:43,652
A nightclub called Balm.
Need to see their security footage.

129
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,154
- <i>I'm on it.</i>
- Nothing here.

130
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,033
Guys?

131
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:49,209
Shoes...

132
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:50,908
clutch...

133
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:53,287
cell phone.

134
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:55,748
- Things a girl does not leave behind.
- And here...

135
00:06:56,109 --> 00:06:57,083
pink fabric.

136
00:06:57,304 --> 00:06:59,794
Remember that photo taken last night
and posted on ZMZ?

137
00:07:00,372 --> 00:07:02,838
Aubrey Darva.
She wore a pink dress.

138
00:07:03,044 --> 00:07:03,839
Find her.

139
00:07:17,807 --> 00:07:18,651
Nice.

140
00:07:21,103 --> 00:07:22,775
So, Aubrey's stepdad is Ben Darva.

141
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,572
Immigrated a penniless kid,

142
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,165
won a full ride to Harvard,

143
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:29,348
made billions in real estate,
and married a socialite from Pasadena.

144
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:31,973
Aubrey is her kid, not his.
Mother died a year ago.

145
00:07:32,113 --> 00:07:35,254
- You vacation with these people?
- No, I just I remember things.

146
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:39,750
- Hi. We're looking for Aubrey Darva.
- Her father's by the pool.

147
00:07:42,341 --> 00:07:45,318
Must be nice to have your morning
latte next to your pool.

148
00:07:46,864 --> 00:07:47,755
Mr. Darva,

149
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,928
I'm Detective Deeks, LAPD.
This is Special Agent Kensi Blye.

150
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,141
You're having surveillance cameras?

151
00:07:55,714 --> 00:07:57,636
Yeah, because of all the break-ins.

152
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,543
In the neighborhood
over the last year.

153
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,371
No one is safe.

154
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:06,318
I'm assuming that's why you're here?

155
00:08:06,512 --> 00:08:08,903
No. We're here
because of your stepdaughter, Aubrey.

156
00:08:09,266 --> 00:08:11,323
- Aubrey?
- Did she come home last night?

157
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,368
Yes. She always comes home.
It's part of our deal.

158
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:16,556
Could you check on her, please?

159
00:08:16,772 --> 00:08:17,915
Sure. This way.

160
00:08:19,359 --> 00:08:20,566
Part of your deal?

161
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,706
Yeah. Aubrey had a problem
with drugs after her mother died.

162
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,007
But I trust her.

163
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:27,151
She's bouncing back.
We have...

164
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:30,593
certain rules.
It was her idea. Are you gonna

165
00:08:30,983 --> 00:08:32,636
tell me what this is all about?

166
00:08:34,499 --> 00:08:36,866
Her car was found at the bottom
of a cliff this morning.

167
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,434
So someone stole her car.

168
00:08:39,012 --> 00:08:40,644
That's what we're here to find out.

169
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:46,855
Aubrey,
there are people here to see you.

170
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,017
We have a deal.

171
00:08:56,603 --> 00:08:57,997
I don't understand.

172
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,540
What is this?

173
00:09:01,782 --> 00:09:03,042
What haven't you told me?

174
00:09:04,045 --> 00:09:07,171
I'm sorry, Mr. Darva, but the driver
of the car had been in a shooting.

175
00:09:08,123 --> 00:09:09,295
Oh, my God.

176
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,091
BOLO's out on Aubrey Darva?

177
00:09:22,133 --> 00:09:25,274
Eric's checking a number she called
every day for the last 6 months.

178
00:09:25,316 --> 00:09:27,348
Perfect. Thanks.
Got something...

179
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:30,511
Police report on the break-ins
in the neighborhood. I have ten.

180
00:09:30,664 --> 00:09:32,679
All high-end houses, all unsolved.

181
00:09:32,832 --> 00:09:35,117
Nine of those addresses
are in Aubrey's phone.

182
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:36,784
She knows the victims.

183
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:39,963
You think she's mixed-up with a break-in
crew? Supplying them with targets?

184
00:09:40,005 --> 00:09:43,274
She would know their habits, schedules,
maybe even their security systems.

185
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:45,829
How does this tie
in to Midshipman Roth?

186
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:48,547
Maybe Roth stumbles onto the ring
tries to be a hero.

187
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:51,465
Or he's part of the ring, and infighting
gets he and Aubrey popped.

188
00:09:51,617 --> 00:09:54,301
- Except Aubrey doesn't need money.
- That's not quite true.

189
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:55,918
She's been in drug rehab,

190
00:09:56,105 --> 00:09:59,462
and her stepfather's tied
her sizable allowance to her recovery.

191
00:09:59,802 --> 00:10:02,193
Maybe she's relapsing,
needs cash to buy drugs.

192
00:10:02,392 --> 00:10:04,770
- You pulled her file?
- Sure, but I knew that already.

193
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:08,732
What? I enjoy my juicy celebrity gossip
as much as the next guy.

194
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:12,236
It's hard to believe a guy like Roth
would be tied up in a break-in crew.

195
00:10:12,456 --> 00:10:14,822
If he was, his shipmates would know.

196
00:10:15,917 --> 00:10:17,426
Nice door stamp.

197
00:10:19,345 --> 00:10:20,953
I'm here because I went to a club?

198
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:23,056
You're here
because your buddy didn't come home.

199
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:24,957
Brian didn't come home?

200
00:10:25,528 --> 00:10:27,638
<i>Maybe he's still with that girl.</i>

201
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:28,669
<i>Sorry.</i>

202
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:29,712
<i>He's dead?</i>

203
00:10:30,778 --> 00:10:32,114
<i>I don't believe it.</i>

204
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,040
Roth was a guy
who was gonna live forever.

205
00:10:37,463 --> 00:10:38,624
Lieutenant Perfect.

206
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:40,393
What did you do yesterday?

207
00:10:41,249 --> 00:10:43,487
We threw Brian a birthday bash.

208
00:10:43,932 --> 00:10:45,772
His birthday's not till June.

209
00:10:46,141 --> 00:10:48,403
L.A. beats a port call in Yemen
for fun, okay?

210
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,678
We deploy in two weeks.
Roth's a card nut, so...

211
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,819
we spent the afternoon
playing poker.

212
00:10:54,003 --> 00:10:55,362
Then we go to Balm, and

213
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:57,323
Brian hooks up with this hot babe.

214
00:10:57,408 --> 00:10:59,325
I mean fantasy island hot.

215
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:02,329
- And he leaves with her.
- That piss you off?

216
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,613
You kidding me?

217
00:11:03,870 --> 00:11:05,605
I wanted to hear his stories.

218
00:11:05,647 --> 00:11:07,667
I mean, ten months at sea,

219
00:11:07,854 --> 00:11:10,526
you want to hear tales like
that and know they're real.

220
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:12,928
I can't believe he's gone.

221
00:11:14,919 --> 00:11:16,818
You see fantasy island in here?

222
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,298
That's her.

223
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:22,473
Is she famous?

224
00:11:23,017 --> 00:11:24,059
Trying to be.

225
00:11:25,038 --> 00:11:26,268
And she's missing.

226
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:30,127
- What do you know about that?
- Nothing.

227
00:11:31,077 --> 00:11:33,275
She and Roth left the club
about 11:30.

228
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:36,403
- And Hadley and I headed back to base.
- Right away?

229
00:11:39,628 --> 00:11:41,246
See, that's funny.

230
00:11:41,691 --> 00:11:43,449
Because if that was true,

231
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:45,537
you'd have made it
to Point Mugu by 1:00 a.m.

232
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:47,581
But you didn't check in until 4:00.

233
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,167
We went for a swim in Santa Monica.

234
00:11:51,095 --> 00:11:52,736
That Ferris wheel has great lights.

235
00:11:53,006 --> 00:11:54,296
Were they still on?

236
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,217
You kind of walked into that.

237
00:12:00,722 --> 00:12:02,738
Your buddy's dead,
his girl's missing

238
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:05,679
and this hole in your timeline
does not look good.

239
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:08,506
So, did you follow them
from the club?

240
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,106
- Have you ever robbed a house?
- No. What's that have to do?

241
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,565
Where's Aubrey Darva?

242
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,094
- I told you, I don't know.
- Where'd you go after Balm?

243
00:12:21,122 --> 00:12:24,096
Hadley's scared like something went down
and Tyre told him to keep quiet.

244
00:12:24,138 --> 00:12:27,468
Tyre is Roth's shipmate, not his friend.
Never used his first name.

245
00:12:27,609 --> 00:12:30,621
Thanks, Eric.
The phone Aubrey calls every day

246
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,627
belongs to her rehab sponsor.
I'll give him a call.

247
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,212
These aren't our shooters?

248
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:38,152
I doubt it. They both seem
genuinely surprised Roth's dead.

249
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:41,009
There's nothing
that doesn't belong here.

250
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,951
No stolen watches, no jewelry.

251
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:46,098
No thick wad of cash.

252
00:12:46,832 --> 00:12:50,253
You don't go to Annapolis to blow it all
by falling in with some break-in crew.

253
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,813
What are these guys hiding?

254
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:55,342
Maybe they know more about
what happened to Aubrey.

255
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:59,596
The longer she's missing,
less likely we find her alive.

256
00:13:00,815 --> 00:13:01,869
What do you have?

257
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:05,490
This is the audio from the SOS system
in Aubrey's Mercedes.

258
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:08,080
Picked up Roth saying something
over and over.

259
00:13:08,353 --> 00:13:10,581
His voice is super weak,
but here's what I got.

260
00:13:16,749 --> 00:13:18,755
Something, something, "king".

261
00:13:19,034 --> 00:13:20,393
Definitely "king".

262
00:13:20,862 --> 00:13:23,302
You don't waste your dying words.
He's saying who shot him.

263
00:13:23,641 --> 00:13:26,090
It sounds like "club".
It's a "Club King".

264
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,111
"Club" could be "Balm".

265
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,208
"King" could be a person.

266
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,650
Or it could be a kingpin.

267
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,352
There's lots of those at Balm.

268
00:13:33,494 --> 00:13:36,190
And Roth left with Aubrey.
Maybe she was somebody else's girl.

269
00:13:36,377 --> 00:13:39,121
Making jealousy a possible motive
for shooting him.

270
00:13:39,851 --> 00:13:41,837
Let me see the security footage
from Balm.

271
00:13:41,879 --> 00:13:42,910
There is none.

272
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,450
- They won't hand it over?
- None to hand over. No cameras.

273
00:13:46,718 --> 00:13:50,081
That's why it's so popular with the rich
and infamous. Nobody's watching.

274
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:52,972
And forget about interviewing witnesses,
even if something happened,

275
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:55,876
- everybody's looking the other way.
- The clock's ticking for the girl.

276
00:13:56,171 --> 00:13:57,586
If she's still alive.

277
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,499
Then we're going clubbing.

278
00:14:03,323 --> 00:14:05,608
If some kingpin at the club
had Roth shot,

279
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,917
it supports Nate's theory
his bunkmates didn't do it.

280
00:14:07,959 --> 00:14:10,709
They haven't told us where they went.
We'll have to stay on them.

281
00:14:10,885 --> 00:14:12,476
What do you say, Sam?

282
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,110
You want a swanky night in a hot club,
or sweating Navy guys in a cold room?

283
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:19,483
This is a fantastic plan,
but you don't just waltz

284
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:20,981
into Balm, okay?

285
00:14:21,023 --> 00:14:24,404
I get in on a connection I've developed,
maybe Kensi gets in 'cause she's hot.

286
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:26,564
Don't make it weird.
But you...

287
00:14:26,606 --> 00:14:28,015
- only one way in.
- Money.

288
00:14:28,057 --> 00:14:30,244
A lot of it. I'll arrange that,
be ready to pay.

289
00:14:30,519 --> 00:14:32,538
- How much?
- Guys drop 30 grand a night.

290
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:37,084
Why don't you go ask Hetty for that?

291
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:39,510
I'll go do that.

292
00:14:43,755 --> 00:14:45,349
I'll go. I'll go ask her.

293
00:14:57,409 --> 00:14:59,773
What can I do for you, Mr. Deeks?

294
00:15:01,171 --> 00:15:03,479
I've been sent to ask for funds
to get into a nightclub

295
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:05,870
undercover
in an attempt to identify Roth

296
00:15:05,912 --> 00:15:07,739
and possibly Aubrey Darva's killer.

297
00:15:10,106 --> 00:15:12,309
That's uncharacteristically
formal speech.

298
00:15:12,351 --> 00:15:14,852
You must be asking
for a lot of money.

299
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,665
Listen, here's the deal, okay?

300
00:15:25,293 --> 00:15:28,562
The only way I get us all in
is if I sell Callen as a big spender.

301
00:15:28,604 --> 00:15:30,741
He needs to flash
one of those credit cards

302
00:15:30,783 --> 00:15:32,764
with a no-questions-asked
kind of limit.

303
00:15:39,515 --> 00:15:40,886
How about this?

304
00:15:55,202 --> 00:15:57,170
$50,000 limit.

305
00:15:57,212 --> 00:15:58,123
However,

306
00:16:00,116 --> 00:16:04,109
if more than $5,000 is charged
to this card,

307
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:07,116
I will come for you
with my letter opener.

308
00:16:07,158 --> 00:16:08,800
Is that clear, Mr. Deeks?

309
00:16:10,346 --> 00:16:11,225
Got it.

310
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:12,271
Wait. What?

311
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:15,189
You want me to sign this?

312
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,494
'Cause it's... it's Cal...
It's Callen's card.

313
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,779
And you're the guarantor.

314
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:24,804
Your credit card.

315
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:27,704
$50,000 limit.

316
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,610
Backstopped in the name
of Ivan Kolvak.

317
00:16:36,503 --> 00:16:37,663
Wardrobe.

318
00:16:42,890 --> 00:16:45,462
- There's a trick somewhere.
- It's got to be a trick.

319
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,631
No trick. Just asked nicely.

320
00:16:50,166 --> 00:16:54,045
Deeks talked you into handing over
a card with a $50,000 limit?

321
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:56,019
Really?

322
00:16:56,886 --> 00:16:58,445
Do you remember Rio?

323
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:00,522
That vicuña suit you wore.

324
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:02,760
It cost ten grand.

325
00:17:03,042 --> 00:17:04,671
The cops hate Deeks.

326
00:17:05,754 --> 00:17:06,942
In Miami,

327
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,083
you nearly scuttled

328
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:12,575
a Feretti yacht of an Omani Prince.

329
00:17:13,225 --> 00:17:15,487
He's a lousy liaison, and

330
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,537
yet I get the sense
he isn't temporary.

331
00:17:18,755 --> 00:17:22,212
The repairs ale cost more
than the limit on that credit card.

332
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:26,003
I'm not complaining
that you gave him the money.

333
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:27,983
How could you, Mr. Callen?

334
00:17:28,311 --> 00:17:29,673
I gave you the card.

335
00:17:30,433 --> 00:17:32,367
You don't want him as a liaison.

336
00:17:33,838 --> 00:17:35,178
You want him as an agent.

337
00:17:36,606 --> 00:17:39,184
If they play Lady Gaga tonight

338
00:17:39,594 --> 00:17:41,657
dance one for me, would you?

339
00:18:03,968 --> 00:18:05,333
Ivan Kolvak and party.

340
00:18:05,611 --> 00:18:06,793
Back of the line.

341
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:10,330
Sorry. We were told
that we were on the list.

342
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,506
Not on the list.

343
00:18:12,349 --> 00:18:15,090
- Back of the line.
- No, it's okay, Jesse. They're with me.

344
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,235
You should have said something.

345
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,331
- All right, brother.
- Thanks, man.

346
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:21,125
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

347
00:18:32,221 --> 00:18:33,932
- Tim, baby!
- There she is.

348
00:18:35,256 --> 00:18:38,232
- So, this is your friend...
- Ivan Kolvak.

349
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:40,963
Dad runs the Russian oil business,
you know.

350
00:18:41,825 --> 00:18:43,586
Well, Ivan, I am Sapphire.

351
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,540
Anything you need, you ask me.

352
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:48,293
I have you at the best table
in the house with a lot

353
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:49,961
of lovely ladies that are excited

354
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,838
- to meet you.
- That's great.

355
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,298
You'd like to open a tab?

356
00:18:57,939 --> 00:18:59,193
God, I love this job.

357
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:00,892
I can see why.

358
00:19:03,471 --> 00:19:05,268
She looks like a high-class madam.

359
00:19:05,459 --> 00:19:07,360
Except for sex is optional.

360
00:19:07,939 --> 00:19:09,554
It's the scene.
What can I say?

361
00:19:09,596 --> 00:19:11,225
She called you Tim.

362
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,859
Been here before?

363
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,638
- Undercover.
- Hers?

364
00:19:15,481 --> 00:19:17,489
God, you're like a bull
instead of a tiger.

365
00:19:18,243 --> 00:19:20,423
You charge on in there.
Thank you, darling

366
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:22,787
Ladies.

367
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:32,067
I don't believe it.

368
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:35,215
My twelve o'clock...
Aubrey Darva

369
00:19:35,853 --> 00:19:36,942
Alive.

370
00:19:42,051 --> 00:19:43,469
And well enough to party.

371
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:57,780
Our victim just became our suspect.

372
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:01,402
This place is a who's who.

373
00:20:01,444 --> 00:20:02,755
Of who's bad.

374
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,763
Aubrey was speaking
to that scrawny guy over there.

375
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,198
Mr. Blood Diamond himself.

376
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,081
And now she's talking to A.J. Madjan,
the mad Armenian.

377
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,551
Guy like
that will kill over an insult.

378
00:20:13,593 --> 00:20:15,367
Or a girl like Aubrey.

379
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,566
Any one of them could have passed
as a club king to Roth.

380
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,512
The question is,
what does Aubrey know?

381
00:20:23,508 --> 00:20:24,868
Time to find out.

382
00:20:28,372 --> 00:20:31,222
- I'm gonna call you Fern, okay?
- Don't you dare call me Fern.

383
00:20:31,264 --> 00:20:33,703
Fern, baby girl.
It's been a long time.

384
00:20:33,745 --> 00:20:35,799
- I'm not interested.
- Come on. Trust me.

385
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:38,932
I got E, shabu, all the coke you can
sink your pretty little face in.

386
00:20:38,974 --> 00:20:39,973
I said no!

387
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:49,956
I don't believe
the jerks in this place.

388
00:20:50,598 --> 00:20:52,998
Sorry. I don't mean you.
It's just...

389
00:20:53,574 --> 00:20:55,337
Haven't been here since I...

390
00:20:56,935 --> 00:20:59,251
You know, good job saying no.

391
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,040
He was a friend.
Used to be.

392
00:21:05,787 --> 00:21:08,037
You don't really need
to know all this stuff.

393
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:09,059
It's okay.

394
00:21:09,253 --> 00:21:12,511
You have to dump friends
who don't get it

395
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:14,765
and make new ones who do.

396
00:21:16,574 --> 00:21:17,774
I haven't made

397
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,843
a friend sober since...

398
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,671
since I was pretty young.

399
00:21:27,792 --> 00:21:28,742
I'm Fern.

400
00:21:29,478 --> 00:21:30,328
Aubrey.

401
00:21:32,876 --> 00:21:34,726
I thought I recognized you.

402
00:21:35,292 --> 00:21:38,779
"L.A. story" I guess. You go for coffee,
and there's Zoe Saldana.

403
00:21:40,406 --> 00:21:41,800
Can you tell I'm from Iowa?

404
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,592
No. No, no. I get it.

405
00:21:44,072 --> 00:21:45,822
I saw Jeremy Piven today.

406
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:49,409
I don't know why,
but that man just...

407
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:51,643
He does it for me.

408
00:21:52,495 --> 00:21:53,295
Where?

409
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,166
When?

410
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,421
At the spa.
A friend took me for my six months.

411
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,494
Six months clean.

412
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:03,394
You'll make it, Fern.
Hang in there.

413
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:08,318
Fern... that was your doing?

414
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,379
Yep.

415
00:22:09,644 --> 00:22:11,494
Kensi is going to kill you.

416
00:22:12,181 --> 00:22:15,120
I tell you what, that Aubrey doesn't
look like she killed anybody last night.

417
00:22:15,484 --> 00:22:19,334
So either she doesn't know about Roth
or her car, or she is ice-cold.

418
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,216
Sapphire said this stuff
is a thousand dollars a bottle.

419
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:24,475
Right.

420
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,682
Hetty cut a side deal with you,
didn't she?

421
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,198
That's how you got the card.

422
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:34,301
Yeah.

423
00:22:34,748 --> 00:22:36,548
So, what's your limit, 15?

424
00:22:37,869 --> 00:22:38,578
Ten?

425
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,693
Come on, five?

426
00:22:45,287 --> 00:22:49,200
I'm supposed to look like I can spend
50, and you're on the hook after five?

427
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,563
She threatened me
with a letter opener.

428
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,331
I guess some people got
to learn the hard way.

429
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:57,951
Why? What are you...

430
00:22:59,365 --> 00:23:01,405
- We'll take two more bottles.
- Okay.

431
00:23:01,447 --> 00:23:04,299
No, she's... Okay, see you.
Listen, no, no.

432
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:06,593
We're good. We're done.
He was...

433
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:08,627
That was a joke.
He's funny.

434
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:11,973
What do you have, Sam?

435
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:14,620
Hadley and Tyre...
they're not our guys.

436
00:23:14,662 --> 00:23:17,259
Spent most of their money
and time with ladies on their laps.

437
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:20,607
Then the club's head geisha
sent the girls to another table.

438
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:23,489
I'm looking at the head geisha now.

439
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,653
Where'd they go after?

440
00:23:25,926 --> 00:23:27,526
<i>A house of ill repute.</i>

441
00:23:28,304 --> 00:23:30,784
<i>- A cheap one.
- Callen, interrupting here.</i>

442
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:33,013
- <i>I got something.</i>
- What is it, Eric?

443
00:23:33,055 --> 00:23:35,512
<i>Aubrey isn't the only
common factor in the break-ins</i>.

444
00:23:35,554 --> 00:23:38,854
<i>The more recent victims
had credit card charges at Balm.</i>

445
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:40,418
Any activity on my card here?

446
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,378
Yeah,
they looked at your credit limit.

447
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,858
That's a great way to figure out
if someone's worth robbing.

448
00:23:46,662 --> 00:23:48,633
Find out just how close they looked,
Eric.

449
00:23:48,675 --> 00:23:49,725
<i>Roger that.</i>

450
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,059
Sometimes I just get so

451
00:23:53,313 --> 00:23:54,808
over being famous.

452
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:57,009
Do you ever date normal guys?

453
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,670
You know, I met this guy last night.

454
00:24:00,057 --> 00:24:01,307
A Navy Officer.

455
00:24:02,746 --> 00:24:05,819
- He didn't even know who I was.
- He liked you for who you are.

456
00:24:05,935 --> 00:24:06,735
Crazy?

457
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:10,184
- Can I talk to you?
- No, Chaz!

458
00:24:10,226 --> 00:24:12,080
I told you that I am not talking.

459
00:24:12,122 --> 00:24:13,660
What's your problem?

460
00:24:14,072 --> 00:24:15,480
It's not your damn business.

461
00:24:22,436 --> 00:24:25,086
Guys? <i>Problem...
someone's grabbed Aubrey.</i>

462
00:24:25,436 --> 00:24:27,758
Stay with her, Kens.
And don't break cover.

463
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:32,707
You think just
because you're in rehab you can walk?

464
00:24:32,749 --> 00:24:35,255
- You're in way too deep!
- If I had known for a second what...

465
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,822
- Leave her alone.
- Or what?

466
00:24:39,864 --> 00:24:41,855
- Smile for the cops.
- Take care of her.

467
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:48,435
Stay down on the ground!

468
00:24:48,477 --> 00:24:50,155
Put your hands behind your head.
Now!

469
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,869
Damn it! Callen?

470
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:57,477
<i>Had to break cover.
I've lost Aubrey.</i>

471
00:24:58,299 --> 00:24:59,599
I got her, Kens.

472
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:05,120
Deeks, south stairwell.

473
00:25:30,024 --> 00:25:30,987
Stay back.

474
00:25:35,677 --> 00:25:37,477
Drop the gun.
Let her go.

475
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,140
No way, man.
I'll pop her!

476
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:45,126
I got it, Callen.

477
00:25:45,641 --> 00:25:47,587
I'm walking out of here. Now!

478
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:49,881
Need you to move now, Deeks.

479
00:25:59,995 --> 00:26:01,086
You okay?

480
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,660
- You're not from Iowa, are you?
- No. And my name's not Fern.

481
00:26:14,452 --> 00:26:15,302
Chaz...

482
00:26:16,389 --> 00:26:17,939
used to be my dealer.

483
00:26:18,637 --> 00:26:19,437
But...

484
00:26:19,952 --> 00:26:21,287
the blond guy, he...?

485
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,690
He's a cop.

486
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:25,041
You were very convincing.

487
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:27,313
He said you were in too deep.

488
00:26:28,889 --> 00:26:30,739
Too deep into what, Aubrey?

489
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,610
Had to do with...

490
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:37,049
People getting robbed, didn't it?

491
00:26:37,514 --> 00:26:38,814
People you know?

492
00:26:49,116 --> 00:26:51,316
Aubrey, if your rehab is for real,

493
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,449
I'm sorry we had
to use it to get to you.

494
00:26:55,134 --> 00:26:58,741
It's one of the hardest parts
of my job... but this is serious.

495
00:27:04,643 --> 00:27:06,693
They asked me if I knew people.

496
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:08,783
If I did,

497
00:27:09,565 --> 00:27:11,847
I'd tell them about their houses

498
00:27:12,378 --> 00:27:13,678
and schedules...

499
00:27:14,829 --> 00:27:15,829
et cetera.

500
00:27:16,205 --> 00:27:19,470
So you were helping them rob
your friends in exchange for drugs?

501
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:22,354
Chaz said
that he sold the info to paparazzi.

502
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,843
I should have known better, but...

503
00:27:27,035 --> 00:27:28,481
I wanted the drugs.

504
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:30,695
And one morning,

505
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:33,474
I'm on the bathroom floor throwing up,
and I hear on the radio

506
00:27:33,516 --> 00:27:36,312
that the Austins had been robbed,
and I...

507
00:27:37,796 --> 00:27:39,196
I put it together.

508
00:27:42,024 --> 00:27:43,524
I'd hit rock bottom.

509
00:27:45,712 --> 00:27:47,012
I got in the car

510
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:49,974
and checked into rehab,
and I have not

511
00:27:50,519 --> 00:27:51,369
used...

512
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:55,512
or told those guys a thing since.

513
00:27:56,899 --> 00:27:59,632
All I'm saying is that Aubrey
was between the suspect and Callen.

514
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:01,645
- He should've let me take the shot.
- Yeah?

515
00:28:01,687 --> 00:28:03,598
And your bullet goes through him
into her.

516
00:28:03,713 --> 00:28:06,362
Okay, but he only had,
like, an inch of the guy's head showing.

517
00:28:06,404 --> 00:28:08,654
Which he hit, now, didn't he, Temp?

518
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:13,297
Club used my credit card
to get personal information.

519
00:28:13,339 --> 00:28:16,591
Address, whether or not
I made payments on alarm systems,

520
00:28:16,633 --> 00:28:19,297
whole bunch of stuff. It's actually
a pretty sophisticated search.

521
00:28:19,406 --> 00:28:22,456
Okay, so Aubrey goes sober,
stops providing intel.

522
00:28:22,554 --> 00:28:25,730
So they start skimming info off
the credit cards. Who ran the card?

523
00:28:25,772 --> 00:28:27,872
That'd be your girlfriend, Sapphire.

524
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,043
Not my girlfriend. It's actually
Tim's girlfriend, and sort of.

525
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,129
So are we arresting her,
or should I do my "liaiser" thing?

526
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,466
We're solving Roth's murder, Deeks.

527
00:28:38,638 --> 00:28:40,385
And that's definitely not a word.

528
00:28:44,331 --> 00:28:47,331
So, you left the club with Brian Roth.
Then what?

529
00:28:48,939 --> 00:28:50,339
Drove to my house,

530
00:28:51,249 --> 00:28:52,499
and we had sex.

531
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,983
He lifted you out of the car,
your dress got caught on the car door.

532
00:28:58,123 --> 00:28:58,873
Yeah.

533
00:29:00,327 --> 00:29:02,115
How did you know about that?

534
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:03,741
What happened next?

535
00:29:05,024 --> 00:29:05,774
We...

536
00:29:06,198 --> 00:29:07,298
fell asleep.

537
00:29:08,049 --> 00:29:10,334
He got up,
I thought to go to the bathroom, but...

538
00:29:10,932 --> 00:29:14,502
he was gone when my friend woke me up
at 8:00 and took me to the spa.

539
00:29:15,618 --> 00:29:18,381
- I never even looked for the car.
- Did he leave a note?

540
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:19,304
No.

541
00:29:20,356 --> 00:29:21,506
I was bummed.

542
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:24,486
I actually

543
00:29:25,124 --> 00:29:26,848
hoped that he would be there.

544
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:32,347
Can you take me home now?

545
00:29:34,035 --> 00:29:37,835
Aubrey puts Brian Roth at the Darva
mansion until about 1:00 a.m.

546
00:29:37,912 --> 00:29:41,890
- Then he drives off the cliff at 2:15.
- With two bullets in him.

547
00:29:42,598 --> 00:29:44,948
So he took a car,
drove somewhere and got shot.

548
00:29:45,749 --> 00:29:47,326
How far could he have gone, Eric?

549
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:51,956
Pretty far.
No traffic that time of night.

550
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,790
Okay, so where did he go?

551
00:29:55,476 --> 00:29:58,526
What the hell
is he mixed-up in that got him shot?

552
00:29:58,682 --> 00:30:01,549
Gambling debts?
His buddies said he played poker.

553
00:30:02,977 --> 00:30:03,927
They did.

554
00:30:05,085 --> 00:30:06,345
I got to check something.

555
00:30:25,509 --> 00:30:27,241
Aubrey, do you have two cell phones?

556
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:28,034
No.

557
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,670
Must be Brian's.

558
00:30:31,899 --> 00:30:33,149
Battery's dead.

559
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:35,562
He didn't say anything to you?

560
00:30:35,604 --> 00:30:38,227
Say he'd be right back,
could he borrow your car?

561
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,796
He just snuck out, leaving his phone,
and took your Mercedes?

562
00:30:41,309 --> 00:30:43,159
Wait, he did say something.

563
00:30:44,106 --> 00:30:45,968
He asked me
if he could raid the fridge.

564
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,855
- The fridge?
- It's in the main house.

565
00:31:02,678 --> 00:31:03,778
Fresh paint.

566
00:31:08,263 --> 00:31:09,363
Still tacky.

567
00:31:10,736 --> 00:31:11,486
Okay.

568
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:14,458
So, if your blood
is under that paint,

569
00:31:14,556 --> 00:31:16,427
it means you were standing here.

570
00:31:16,653 --> 00:31:17,731
You got shot.

571
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:19,752
Then what?

572
00:31:20,264 --> 00:31:22,698
Roth didn't say, "Club King",
he said, "King of Clubs".

573
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:25,526
- He got shot over a poker hand?
- It's not a game, it's the deck.

574
00:31:25,568 --> 00:31:28,750
A special deck issued to all the sailors
and soldiers who went to Iraq.

575
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:31,148
Iraq war fugitive cards.
Always my lucky deck.

576
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:34,225
Eric, King of Clubs,
captured or killed or still at large?

577
00:31:35,807 --> 00:31:37,103
Hassan Al-Jahiri.

578
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:39,146
One of Saddam's top Generals.

579
00:31:39,317 --> 00:31:41,774
- Still at large.
- He was there yesterday at the house.

580
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,778
Roth must have seen him
and recognized him.

581
00:31:45,966 --> 00:31:47,601
And got shot for it.

582
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:50,449
In the car, he wasn't just telling us
who shot him...

583
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,327
He was trying to warn us,
like a good soldier should.

584
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:57,403
Hey, it says here that Jahiri's been
advising terrorists via the Internet.

585
00:31:57,526 --> 00:31:59,813
He's providing military tactics
for dozens of attacks

586
00:31:59,855 --> 00:32:02,563
over the last few years
from London to Malaysia.

587
00:32:02,605 --> 00:32:04,338
This is one dangerous dude.

588
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,173
Okay.

589
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:08,884
Shooter stands here.

590
00:32:11,215 --> 00:32:13,691
Let me see
if he left me any casings.

591
00:32:36,448 --> 00:32:37,757
Lost an earring.

592
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,278
Ben Darva's Persian.

593
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,631
An Iraqi General's
a strange house guest.

594
00:32:52,673 --> 00:32:54,388
Come on, Kensi, pick up.

595
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,773
My boyfriend jokes, and he says
that I shouldn't go out

596
00:32:56,815 --> 00:32:59,727
with two earrings because
I always lose one of them, right?

597
00:33:00,309 --> 00:33:01,309
Sorry.

598
00:33:01,618 --> 00:33:02,605
That's him.

599
00:33:02,838 --> 00:33:03,898
Hey, Ivan.

600
00:33:04,063 --> 00:33:05,620
<i>Hey, Kensi, you've got company?</i>

601
00:33:05,662 --> 00:33:07,276
Yeah, yeah, that's right.

602
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,571
Listen, Roth was shot at the house.

603
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,407
Oh, my God, I totally think so, too.

604
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,673
By Hassan Al-Jahiri,
a former Iraqi General.

605
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:19,611
I'm gonna send you his photo
and information now.

606
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:29,590
Oh, my God, that is hilarious.
He is so right in my face.

607
00:33:31,047 --> 00:33:32,385
Jahiri's in the room.

608
00:33:32,469 --> 00:33:33,511
Kensi,

609
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:35,116
<i>Sit tight</i>.

610
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:37,014
I love you.

611
00:33:39,114 --> 00:33:41,811
Notice how I didn't tell him
anything about losing an earring?

612
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:45,179
- Do you have anything diet?
- Fridge.

613
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:56,521
Nope.

614
00:33:57,222 --> 00:33:58,346
No diet.

615
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:02,981
Eric, bring up Kensi's phone.

616
00:34:07,098 --> 00:34:08,587
They're looking right at her.

617
00:34:08,853 --> 00:34:10,554
Tell me she hasn't been made, Sam.

618
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:14,034
No. He's telling them to burn
everything with blood on it.

619
00:34:14,747 --> 00:34:16,949
Why hasn't she been made?
You were there yesterday.

620
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:18,975
He must not have seen her, just me.

621
00:34:20,027 --> 00:34:22,143
Let's go.
Eric, brief Hetty.

622
00:34:23,339 --> 00:34:25,113
Wait, shouldn't we send in SWAT?

623
00:34:25,155 --> 00:34:27,214
We're 15 minutes out,
SWAT takes at least 20.

624
00:34:27,256 --> 00:34:29,742
Besides, we go in hot,
it lowers her survival chances.

625
00:34:29,784 --> 00:34:32,153
We got to get through
that door without a battering ram.

626
00:34:35,584 --> 00:34:36,725
Who are you?

627
00:34:36,937 --> 00:34:39,452
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Fern.
Nice to meet you.

628
00:34:40,435 --> 00:34:42,368
You still in the kitchen, Kensi?

629
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,980
- Oh, hi, uncle Steve.
- Hey.

630
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:48,371
Well, is it...

631
00:34:48,977 --> 00:34:50,454
Fern or Kensi?

632
00:34:51,035 --> 00:34:52,339
It's Fern Kensi.

633
00:34:53,912 --> 00:34:55,621
Aubrey's my sponsor.

634
00:34:55,663 --> 00:34:59,096
Oh, oh, I wasn't supposed to say.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

635
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:01,869
No. No, no, it's okay.
He knows about rehab.

636
00:35:04,396 --> 00:35:05,436
Well...

637
00:35:06,325 --> 00:35:07,772
I lost another earring.

638
00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:11,484
Pleasure to meet you.

639
00:35:12,309 --> 00:35:13,091
Bye.

640
00:35:19,523 --> 00:35:22,273
Both Darva and Jahiri went
to Harvard.

641
00:35:22,788 --> 00:35:25,216
- They were roommates.
- Look at this, look at this.

642
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:28,506
From 1982. Iran and Iraq
are at war with each other,

643
00:35:28,548 --> 00:35:31,244
Darva was attacked
by some Iraqi students, and...

644
00:35:32,117 --> 00:35:33,756
Jahiri saved his life.

645
00:35:33,879 --> 00:35:37,718
And now Darva's returning
the favor by giving him shelter.

646
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:41,133
- What was that about?
- Uncle Steve?

647
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:44,364
He's my dad's cousin or something.
He lives in the main house.

648
00:35:45,037 --> 00:35:46,842
You think that he shot Brian?

649
00:35:47,215 --> 00:35:49,590
Can you get off the property
without being seen?

650
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,267
Then go, and walk fast.

651
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:53,467
- Yeah, but why?
- Aubrey, just go.

652
00:35:56,656 --> 00:35:57,972
Are you kidding?

653
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:02,201
Oh, give me a break.

654
00:36:02,384 --> 00:36:05,280
Guys, why is Kensi going back
into the lion's den?

655
00:36:05,566 --> 00:36:08,264
- Because it's her job.
- She got Aubrey to safety,

656
00:36:08,306 --> 00:36:10,130
now she's got
to keep eyes on Jahiri.

657
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:11,679
He's a high-level target.

658
00:36:17,507 --> 00:36:19,999
Oh, agent Blye.
Have you found my daughter?

659
00:36:20,622 --> 00:36:21,754
Agent Blye?

660
00:36:22,818 --> 00:36:23,887
Agent Blye?

661
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:25,766
Aubrey's been missing, Hassan.

662
00:36:26,582 --> 00:36:28,065
Aubrey is in her room.

663
00:36:29,725 --> 00:36:31,134
And this woman...

664
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:34,432
is a liability.

665
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:39,791
We've lost her.

666
00:36:40,844 --> 00:36:42,286
Where's Callen?

667
00:36:44,863 --> 00:36:46,049
Closing fast.

668
00:36:47,288 --> 00:36:49,189
What's this about?
You can't do this.

669
00:36:49,231 --> 00:36:50,328
It's too late.

670
00:36:50,764 --> 00:36:52,543
You know he's going to kill me.

671
00:36:53,593 --> 00:36:55,857
Just like he killed the man
who died in Aubrey's car.

672
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:57,423
You've given him a safe place,

673
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:59,893
and in return, he's been running
a terrorist operation.

674
00:36:59,935 --> 00:37:02,934
No, Jahiri saved my life.

675
00:37:04,458 --> 00:37:05,973
I won't let them hurt you.

676
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,221
- Good luck with that.
- Hassan, please!

677
00:37:08,375 --> 00:37:10,266
Little league bombing in Guam...

678
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:11,424
his plan.

679
00:37:11,466 --> 00:37:14,565
A list of his military exploits
is on my phone... go check.

680
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,204
Pretty big body count.

681
00:37:21,258 --> 00:37:22,540
I owed you, Hassan.

682
00:37:23,335 --> 00:37:24,491
But this?

683
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:26,433
I'm gonna call the police.

684
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:28,245
Ben.

685
00:37:30,792 --> 00:37:32,633
Thank you for the hospitality.

686
00:37:46,213 --> 00:37:47,743
Deeks, around back.

687
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,262
Get off me!

688
00:37:49,695 --> 00:37:50,816
Get off me!

689
00:38:05,896 --> 00:38:07,647
<i>I need to talk to your boss.</i>

690
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,915
Callen!

691
00:38:23,789 --> 00:38:24,843
Turn over!

692
00:38:50,147 --> 00:38:51,489
Oh, come on. What?

693
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:55,265
You got some sort of superman double
back flip where you can dodge bullets?

694
00:38:55,307 --> 00:38:57,793
I mean, you can't tell me
I shouldn't have taken that shot.

695
00:38:58,656 --> 00:38:59,374
No.

696
00:39:00,169 --> 00:39:01,422
I'm glad you did.

697
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:11,140
May I?

698
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:13,349
Sure, Tim...
just don't touch the doll.

699
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,908
So, Sapphire spilled her guts.

700
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:19,042
The break-in ring involved
our dealer friends,

701
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:21,891
couple of ex-con B&E guys,
and Sapphire's club girls

702
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:25,066
that she would use to keep
the target "busy" at Balm

703
00:39:25,108 --> 00:39:27,364
while the crew would break in
and Rob their house.

704
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,367
That's pretty good PR
for the PD on that bust.

705
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,161
Even got a compliment from my boss.

706
00:39:32,698 --> 00:39:34,413
That makes you feel
all gooey inside?

707
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,399
Like a warm chocolate chip cookie.

708
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:39,752
You one of those guys who needs
external validation and coddling?

709
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,003
Only from you, Sam.

710
00:39:41,603 --> 00:39:43,124
You want to coddle me?

711
00:39:51,463 --> 00:39:52,782
How's your stepdad?

712
00:39:53,696 --> 00:39:55,872
Uh, well, he just got out
of surgery.

713
00:39:56,015 --> 00:39:57,969
He is still under
from the anesthesia,

714
00:39:58,011 --> 00:40:00,606
- but they think he's going to be okay.
- Good.

715
00:40:01,321 --> 00:40:02,700
You guys are close?

716
00:40:03,243 --> 00:40:04,543
Not really.

717
00:40:04,585 --> 00:40:07,654
I kind of got dumped on him
after my mom died.

718
00:40:08,126 --> 00:40:09,573
What about your real dad?

719
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,680
My mom said
that she would tell me one day.

720
00:40:16,024 --> 00:40:18,617
You know, when I first met
your stepfather...

721
00:40:20,363 --> 00:40:22,140
he worried about you like...

722
00:40:22,479 --> 00:40:23,677
like a real dad.

723
00:40:28,147 --> 00:40:31,036
I've spent a lot of time
looking for my real dad...

724
00:40:33,055 --> 00:40:34,144
But...

725
00:40:36,485 --> 00:40:37,957
Ben's sort of...

726
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:40,573
been that all along.

727
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:43,524
Hasn't he?

728
00:40:47,026 --> 00:40:50,155
Bet you the first thing that he wants
to see when he wakes up is you.

729
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:52,347
Just so he knows you're okay.

730
00:41:06,036 --> 00:41:08,742
I haven't seen the bill,
but if it's over five grand...

731
00:41:09,022 --> 00:41:10,134
Go easy on him.

732
00:41:11,206 --> 00:41:11,958
Why?

733
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:15,650
The cops hate Deeks.
He's a lousy liaison.

734
00:41:15,748 --> 00:41:17,773
That's not what you wanted him for.

735
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,136
You do your homework, don't you?

736
00:41:23,027 --> 00:41:24,481
In choosing agents.

737
00:41:26,425 --> 00:41:28,455
Deeks didn't end up in this building

738
00:41:28,497 --> 00:41:31,118
because we needed some LAPD liaison.

739
00:41:32,096 --> 00:41:34,116
You've been watching him
for a while.

740
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:38,559
There is value in being patient.

741
00:41:40,223 --> 00:41:42,708
So, how long did you watch me
before I joined NCIS?

742
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:45,832
When did G. Callen become
a blip on your radar?

743
00:41:46,876 --> 00:41:48,122
Was it Kiev?

744
00:41:50,658 --> 00:41:51,743
Houston?

745
00:41:54,059 --> 00:41:55,137
Bogota.

746
00:41:57,627 --> 00:42:00,332
Come on, don't tell me
it was, uh, Jersey City?

747
00:42:00,825 --> 00:42:01,935
Peking.

748
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:04,196
You mean, Beijing?

749
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:13,108
Tea, Mr. Callen.

750
00:42:16,631 --> 00:42:18,484
It was Jersey City, wasn't it?

751
00:42:20,114 --> 00:42:21,680
Gulls are coming in.

752
00:42:21,925 --> 00:42:25,420
That means there's gonna be wicked swell
on the bay by the morning.

753
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:29,838
- You're a surfer, huh?
- Yeah.

754
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,340
Well, surf early.

755
00:42:32,899 --> 00:42:35,181
I'm sure Hetty told you
we start at 9:30.

756
00:42:37,717 --> 00:42:38,952
Though...

757
00:42:39,472 --> 00:42:41,838
after your liaising today,

758
00:42:42,435 --> 00:42:44,504
I'm not sure why we'd have you back.

759
00:42:44,546 --> 00:42:46,396
Yeah, I'm not coming in tomorrow.

760
00:42:48,982 --> 00:42:51,135
LAPD op I been trying
to set up for months...

761
00:42:51,177 --> 00:42:53,841
All the pieces finally came
together about an hour ago.

762
00:42:53,883 --> 00:42:55,499
Going undercover tonight.

763
00:42:56,945 --> 00:42:58,058
For how long?

764
00:42:58,312 --> 00:43:00,203
I don't know, cover's pretty deep.

765
00:43:04,886 --> 00:43:06,311
Don't worry, Fern.

766
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:08,514
I'll be back.

767
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,356
Yeah,...

768
00:43:15,398 --> 00:43:16,453
maybe.

769
00:43:16,495 --> 00:43:18,504
