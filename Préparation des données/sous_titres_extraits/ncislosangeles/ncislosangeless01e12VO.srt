00:00:03,762 --> 00:00:06,826
<i>And it's another beautiful morning here
in the southland.</i>

2
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:10,190
<i>Clear and sunny skies with a high
for the day of 78 degrees.</i>

3
00:00:10,565 --> 00:00:13,137
<i>Current temperature outside
is a crisp 60.</i>

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,723
<i>Still no traffic problems
at this early hour.</i>

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:18,727
<i>Clear cruising
on most of the major freeways, but...</i>

6
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,020
<i>watch out for construction
at the entrance</i>

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,838
<i>of the 101 off Vine and Hollywood.</i>

8
00:00:23,412 --> 00:00:25,919
<i>Commuters headed
in that direction of Vine...</i>

9
00:00:35,922 --> 00:00:37,820
Fourth and Spring?
No problem.

10
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:43,084
You see that sunrise?

11
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:44,500
Yeah.

12
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,837
Another day in paradise, right?

13
00:00:48,121 --> 00:00:49,465
Not a morning person?

14
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:50,549
Who is?

15
00:00:51,746 --> 00:00:53,473
If you want my money, take it!

16
00:00:53,598 --> 00:00:54,971
It's not your money I want.

17
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:05,768
Help! Help!

18
00:01:07,713 --> 00:01:08,734
Help me!

19
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,082
.: Team UnderCovers :.

20
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:50,151
NCIS LA 1x12
[ Past Lives ]

21
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,179
I got it.

22
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,288
Cowboy Bar on Sunset.

23
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,251
- With the mechanical bull?
- Yeah.

24
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,765
No, Hetty, plus mechanical bull,
plus tequila equals bar fight.

25
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,725
Trust me, I've been there. Dom?

26
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,494
Is that a doll?

27
00:02:15,537 --> 00:02:19,287
No.
This is one of only 500 Alpha Centauri

28
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:22,310
Imperial Class Guardian
Bobbleheads in the entire world.

29
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:25,728
- It's... not a doll.
- You're playing with an alien doll?

30
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:27,506
At work?

31
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:31,108
There is a difference
between dolls and bobbleheads.

32
00:02:31,461 --> 00:02:34,578
And Imperial Class Alpha
Centauris are only part alien.

33
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,198
The other part is cyborg,
I mean, everyone...

34
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:41,536
- How about Disneyland?
- I hate Disneyland.

35
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,660
- Kensi hates Disneyland.
- The happiest place on Earth?

36
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,544
I have issues with...

37
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:52,630
- grown men in furry costumes.
- Unless it's Thursday night.

38
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,241
- What are we talking about?
- Quality time with the team.

39
00:02:57,417 --> 00:02:59,530
Apparently,
it's been too long since we hung out,

40
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:01,722
unless there's a corpse involved.

41
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:04,058
- We're brainstorming ideas.
- Bowling.

42
00:03:04,226 --> 00:03:05,660
It's great competition,

43
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:08,187
builds camaraderie,
and you wear those funny shoes.

44
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:09,604
No bowling.

45
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,653
What about the Cowboy Bar on Sunset?

46
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:16,195
Oh, that sounds like fun.

47
00:03:16,588 --> 00:03:18,489
They have a mechanical bull, Hetty.

48
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:21,604
No, never mind.

49
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:24,993
Mr. Callen,

50
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,859
you've received
an email this morning.

51
00:03:28,316 --> 00:03:30,042
More specifically, Jason Tedrow

52
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,669
received an email.

53
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:33,796
Who's Jason Tedrow?

54
00:03:35,312 --> 00:03:36,799
Alias... from an old case.

55
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,635
I don't remember it.

56
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,755
You were on assignment
in Afghanistan.

57
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:44,598
A case that now involves all of us.

58
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:45,641
Why is that?

59
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:49,395
Because the man who sent you
the email was killed two hours ago.

60
00:03:50,661 --> 00:03:52,273
The cabbie's name was Joey Gale.

61
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,401
- Former navy systems technician.
- How'd he end up driving a cab?

62
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:57,935
Four years ago,
we took Gale and his accomplices down

63
00:03:57,977 --> 00:04:00,619
for pulling an electronic heist
of five million dollars from

64
00:04:00,661 --> 00:04:02,783
the Naval Advanced
Defense Research Fund.

65
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,368
Gale was the inside guy.

66
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:08,422
Montrell Perez.

67
00:04:09,198 --> 00:04:11,834
- He was the crew's leader.
- Sociopath with gang ties.

68
00:04:12,089 --> 00:04:14,921
- Fourth Street Flats.
- Flats, rough boys.

69
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,226
Tight knit.

70
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,671
- Jon Donnelly.
- No prior record.

71
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,177
Bunked with Perez,
who dragged him into it.

72
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:24,722
- How'd you catch them?
- Deep cover op.

73
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:27,715
I went in as Jason Tedrow,
a dirty MP.

74
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,692
Spent months getting close to them.
Told them I knew they had the money

75
00:04:31,734 --> 00:04:34,482
and that I could use my connections
to sabotage the investigation.

76
00:04:34,808 --> 00:04:36,929
They believed me.
I asked for a cut.

77
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:40,529
And on the day of the payoff,
NCIS arrested all of us.

78
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,447
Now,

79
00:04:41,951 --> 00:04:43,486
Gale and Donnelly

80
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:46,123
struck up a deal
to testify against Perez.

81
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:48,475
They each did four years
and got released.

82
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,206
But Perez wasn't so lucky.

83
00:04:50,442 --> 00:04:51,916
He's doing a ten-year stretch

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,877
at the Naval Consolidated Brig
at Miramar

85
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:56,920
So, where does this crew think
their buddy Tedrow ended up?

86
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,286
Shipped off to a brig
in South Carolina.

87
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,313
- And the 5 million?
- Gone.

88
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,552
Gale used his access to transfer
the money from the fund

89
00:05:04,677 --> 00:05:06,040
to an outside account.

90
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:09,433
But the money was gone from the account
when the investigators got access.

91
00:05:09,831 --> 00:05:12,044
Gale and the rest of them
passed lie detector tests.

92
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:14,229
They had no idea
where that money went.

93
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,398
NCIS got the convictions
that they wanted,

94
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:18,483
but the 5 million dollars
was never found.

95
00:05:18,608 --> 00:05:21,278
Which leads us back to the email
Gale sent to Jason Tedrow.

96
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,772
Right. Now, Gale's been tracking down
the money

97
00:05:23,897 --> 00:05:25,739
since he was paroled
three weeks ago.

98
00:05:26,405 --> 00:05:27,702
He found an account number.

99
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:30,704
Now he wants
Jason Tedrow's help getting it.

100
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:33,249
Why get in touch with someone
he hasn't seen for so long?

101
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,834
I'm just a naturally likeable guy.

102
00:05:35,432 --> 00:05:37,795
- Or he was desperate.
- Could be a little bit of both.

103
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:40,573
Given their history,
Gale must've thought Tedrow was

104
00:05:40,615 --> 00:05:43,259
- of the only people he could trust.
- Honor among thieves.

105
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,762
Gale connected the money
to a shell corporation,

106
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:48,572
but the account was closed
approximately two hours ago,

107
00:05:48,697 --> 00:05:51,151
right around the time
that this happened.

108
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,084
This is a traffic cam on the corner.

109
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,323
He tossed the murder weapon
so he wouldn't be caught with it.

110
00:06:07,448 --> 00:06:09,358
It wasn't a mugging,
it was an execution.

111
00:06:09,483 --> 00:06:11,620
Someone knew he was getting close
to the money.

112
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,830
Kensi, head down to the brig in Miramar.
Find out what Perez knows.

113
00:06:14,955 --> 00:06:17,589
And if Perez has ties to the Flats,
then he's a suspect.

114
00:06:17,714 --> 00:06:20,629
- Could've ordered the hit from prison.
- All right, on my way.

115
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,227
Where's Jon Donnelly?

116
00:06:22,352 --> 00:06:24,216
Paroled three weeks ago, like Gale.

117
00:06:24,477 --> 00:06:26,082
But no driver's license,

118
00:06:26,207 --> 00:06:28,637
no utility bills, no credit cards.
Off the grid.

119
00:06:29,094 --> 00:06:30,137
I'll find him.

120
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:18,604
How is our old friend Jason Tedrow?

121
00:07:20,928 --> 00:07:24,544
- It's just another alias, Hetty.
- An alias that reminds me

122
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,315
of something
Theodore Roethke once wrote:

123
00:07:28,303 --> 00:07:30,032
"My soul, like some

124
00:07:30,343 --> 00:07:32,464
"heat-maddened summer fly,

125
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:34,328
keeps buzzing at the sill.

126
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,261
Which I

127
00:07:36,612 --> 00:07:37,421
is I?"

128
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:41,121
- Well, I've been a lot of people.
- Yes,

129
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:44,710
but you enjoyed being
Jason Tedrow best.

130
00:07:59,753 --> 00:08:01,768
It bothers me, too, Mr. Hanna.

131
00:08:04,007 --> 00:08:05,526
He's going lone wolf on us.

132
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:08,362
Keep an eye on him.

133
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:11,088
He's good at spotting tails.

134
00:08:11,627 --> 00:08:13,338
And you're good at running them.

135
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:15,283
Stay close.

136
00:08:16,009 --> 00:08:17,274
Lone wolf or not,

137
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:20,157
Mr. Callen is one of our own.

138
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:44,799
Oh, my God.

139
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,656
Been a while.

140
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,372
Mom!

141
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:57,911
Jason, this is Michael.

142
00:08:58,517 --> 00:08:59,372
My son.

143
00:09:22,339 --> 00:09:23,270
What is this?

144
00:09:23,882 --> 00:09:26,648
You think you can just waltz back
into my life?

145
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,722
- Thought you'd be glad to see me.
- You disappeared.

146
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:31,586
I was in prison.

147
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:34,140
That's not an excuse.

148
00:09:34,632 --> 00:09:36,296
You didn't even say good-bye.

149
00:09:36,756 --> 00:09:40,026
That would've made it harder. I didn't
want you to have to deal with this, too.

150
00:09:40,068 --> 00:09:43,341
The only person who decides
what I am fit to deal with is me.

151
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:46,001
I've dealt with plenty.

152
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:48,384
And I'm doing just fine.

153
00:09:50,028 --> 00:09:52,299
- I'm looking for your brother.
- Jon?

154
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:56,178
He's still a lost cause.
Figures you'd be looking for him.

155
00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:57,868
Kristin?

156
00:09:58,723 --> 00:09:59,724
In the kitchen.

157
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:00,762
Hey, big guy!

158
00:10:01,313 --> 00:10:03,059
- Come here!
- How are you, kid?

159
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:06,063
Jason Tedrow, this is Tommy Boyd.

160
00:10:06,891 --> 00:10:07,814
My fiancé.

161
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,040
Nice to meet you.

162
00:10:11,532 --> 00:10:12,402
Likewise.

163
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:15,263
Jason's an old friend of Jon's.

164
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:17,950
He was just leaving.

165
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:29,474
- You're getting married?
- Met him right after you vanished.

166
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,197
You thought
I was just gonna wait for you?

167
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:35,412
No, I...

168
00:10:36,642 --> 00:10:37,594
I get it.

169
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:41,723
Last I heard,

170
00:10:41,952 --> 00:10:44,659
Jon was hanging out in front
of the Supply Depot in East L.A.

171
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:46,581
Just looking to pick up odd jobs.

172
00:10:46,850 --> 00:10:48,303
Trying to make ends meet.

173
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:52,442
Thanks.

174
00:10:56,915 --> 00:10:57,958
I've moved on.

175
00:10:58,298 --> 00:10:59,165
Please,

176
00:10:59,704 --> 00:11:00,817
don't come back.

177
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,055
I spotted your tail
a half mile into my drive.

178
00:11:21,814 --> 00:11:24,292
If you spotted me,
you would have tried to shake me.

179
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:27,686
It was that, leapfrog maneuver
on Olympic that gave you away.

180
00:11:27,945 --> 00:11:28,883
You wish.

181
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:32,024
What?

182
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:35,133
You got involved with Donnelly's sister
during the case?

183
00:11:37,048 --> 00:11:39,786
She was never a suspect or a witness,
okay? It was deep cover.

184
00:11:39,828 --> 00:11:42,701
I just used her to gain
the trust of her brother's crew.

185
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:51,218
So I got close to her.

186
00:11:51,863 --> 00:11:55,047
She doesn't know my real name. The man
she fell in love with never exist.

187
00:11:55,368 --> 00:11:56,692
What about the kid?

188
00:11:56,817 --> 00:11:59,801
He was never a suspect, either,
but he did seem a little shifty.

189
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,448
Who's the kid's father?

190
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,333
I don't know.

191
00:12:12,533 --> 00:12:14,607
- User log in, please.
- Thanks.

192
00:12:23,295 --> 00:12:24,535
Agent Blye, NCIS?

193
00:12:25,556 --> 00:12:28,404
- That's me.
- Lieutenant Commander Neil Corby, JAG.

194
00:12:29,042 --> 00:12:31,291
- Montrell Perez is my client.
- And?

195
00:12:33,155 --> 00:12:35,018
You're assuming I have conditions?

196
00:12:35,628 --> 00:12:37,506
We arrested him.
You defended him.

197
00:12:38,136 --> 00:12:40,759
And our relationship
is adversarial by nature.

198
00:12:46,081 --> 00:12:48,449
I need something.
You have it.

199
00:12:48,574 --> 00:12:50,616
Namely,
the cooperation of my client.

200
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:51,714
Quid pro quo.

201
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,892
I scratch your back,
you scratch mine.

202
00:12:54,114 --> 00:12:56,130
Easy now, Agent Blye. We just met.

203
00:12:58,571 --> 00:12:59,742
What do you want?

204
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:03,058
I'm petitioning the Court of Appeals
for a reduction in his sentence.

205
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:05,284
I'd appreciate the support
of NCIS at the hearing.

206
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,720
I will see what I can do.

207
00:13:07,845 --> 00:13:08,841
Much obliged.

208
00:13:09,439 --> 00:13:10,400
So now...

209
00:13:11,255 --> 00:13:12,814
let's scratch your itch.

210
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,220
Keep it down,

211
00:13:19,602 --> 00:13:20,540
gentlemen.

212
00:13:21,993 --> 00:13:23,301
Here comes our boy.

213
00:13:38,758 --> 00:13:41,453
- You smell her?
- Counselor, put a leash on your client,

214
00:13:41,969 --> 00:13:43,281
or I'll do it myself.

215
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:46,455
Agent Blye is prepared to help us get
you out of here earlier than planned.

216
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:49,286
All you have to do
is answer some questions.

217
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:51,497
For this piece, I'll do it for free.

218
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:53,874
Joey Gale is dead.

219
00:13:54,276 --> 00:13:55,792
And not from natural causes?

220
00:13:56,322 --> 00:13:59,421
- Gunned in the street this morning.
- Well, I hope it hurt.

221
00:14:01,946 --> 00:14:03,036
I didn't do it.

222
00:14:05,151 --> 00:14:07,155
But you're tight
with people who could.

223
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:09,401
Prison records show
you made a dozen calls to

224
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:11,767
the Fourth Street Flats members
over the last month.

225
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:14,060
Ain't no crime to phone home.

226
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:16,522
- What about Jon Donnelly?
- I hope he's next.

227
00:14:17,879 --> 00:14:20,117
Gale and Donnelly turned on me.
Karma's a bitch.

228
00:14:20,242 --> 00:14:21,090
Montrell.

229
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:23,945
Please stop making yourself
a suspect in this case.

230
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:24,988
Knock it off.

231
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:28,056
I haven't had a visitor in a long time.
Let me try to work this out.

232
00:14:28,181 --> 00:14:29,201
We're done.

233
00:14:31,612 --> 00:14:32,621
Call me, huh?

234
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:35,749
I ain't going anywhere.
Maybe we could go out on a date.

235
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:43,819
Package for you...

236
00:14:44,292 --> 00:14:45,675
from a JAG lawyer.

237
00:14:46,144 --> 00:14:47,928
- Corby?
- You read the card.

238
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,432
For security purposes.

239
00:14:49,557 --> 00:14:52,081
You know, national security,
classified document protocol...

240
00:14:52,123 --> 00:14:54,518
He doesn't have clearance
to know about this location.

241
00:14:55,049 --> 00:14:58,313
He sent them through central
NCIS mail dispatch in San Diego.

242
00:14:59,689 --> 00:15:00,813
In record time.

243
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,567
I hate flowers.

244
00:15:07,142 --> 00:15:08,783
Give him points for trying.

245
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,377
- Here we go.
- I'll handle it.

246
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:42,024
This crowd can smell
a cop a mile away.

247
00:15:42,728 --> 00:15:45,470
- I smell like a cop?
- Actually, you smell like baby powder

248
00:15:45,595 --> 00:15:47,662
- but that's a different conversation.
- What?

249
00:15:49,044 --> 00:15:50,357
You're scaring me.

250
00:16:05,555 --> 00:16:06,317
Jon?

251
00:16:12,575 --> 00:16:14,028
I just want to talk.

252
00:16:16,571 --> 00:16:17,719
- God!
- Geez!

253
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:19,877
You trying to get killed?

254
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:21,855
I'm trying to stop myself
from getting killed!

255
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:23,044
You all right?

256
00:16:23,169 --> 00:16:25,442
I heard about Gale.
Thought maybe I was next.

257
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:29,468
Haven't seen anyone run so fast
since you got caught with that

258
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:31,271
Marine's girlfriend in San Diego.

259
00:16:31,396 --> 00:16:32,994
That guy was a knuckle dragger.

260
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,731
The only reason I ran is
because you broke the land speed record

261
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:38,640
getting out of that bar after
you realized he had buddies with him.

262
00:16:40,755 --> 00:16:42,049
It's good to see you.

263
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:51,093
Isn't this where you tell me I look good
for a guy who did 48 months in the brig?

264
00:16:51,533 --> 00:16:53,178
I'm a thief, I'm not a liar.

265
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,094
How'd you find me?

266
00:17:00,337 --> 00:17:01,227
Kristin.

267
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:04,228
Bet she was glad to see you.

268
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:06,608
Well, not as much as I'd hoped.

269
00:17:08,703 --> 00:17:10,544
I saw the report
on Gale this morning...

270
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:12,781
And you heard
it was a botched mugging,

271
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:15,450
- you thought I killed him.
- I didn't say that.

272
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,078
Don't feel bad.
I thought the same thing about you.

273
00:17:19,328 --> 00:17:21,123
So the 5 million's still missing,
isn't it?

274
00:17:21,742 --> 00:17:23,510
I don't know anything
about the money.

275
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,379
I don't want to be looking
over my shoulder the rest of my life.

276
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,405
You think Perez
could have done this?

277
00:17:32,046 --> 00:17:33,301
He's a sick bastard.

278
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,179
When I was locked up,
every time I talked to my sister,

279
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,743
she made a point of asking
if I'd heard from you.

280
00:17:40,638 --> 00:17:42,310
Broke her heart pretty bad.

281
00:17:45,713 --> 00:17:46,982
I made a mistake.

282
00:17:47,388 --> 00:17:48,608
You're damn right.

283
00:17:48,842 --> 00:17:50,354
And to make up for it,

284
00:17:50,396 --> 00:17:52,764
you're gonna call
my little sister and apologize

285
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:54,233
for all the things and...

286
00:18:16,457 --> 00:18:18,996
This is the security cam
from Jet Plastics.

287
00:18:19,187 --> 00:18:21,246
No plates, guy in a mask.

288
00:18:21,911 --> 00:18:23,247
No way to ID the driver.

289
00:18:23,684 --> 00:18:25,569
Gale and Donnelly are both dead.

290
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,229
That leaves Montrell Perez.

291
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,795
Guy in the SUV didn't take a shot
at Jason Tedrow.

292
00:18:31,885 --> 00:18:32,778
Why not?

293
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:40,477
You okay?

294
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,684
Jason Tedrow didn't show up
as a player until the end.

295
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:51,852
Gale and Donnelly more than me.

296
00:18:51,894 --> 00:18:53,673
Or he tried to shot you too
and he missed.

297
00:18:53,895 --> 00:18:56,607
Gale and Donnelly both testified
against Perez in court.

298
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:57,857
He hated them for that.

299
00:18:58,651 --> 00:19:00,901
He could buy himself
a Fourth Street Flats hit squad

300
00:19:00,943 --> 00:19:02,963
for a whole lot less
than 5 million dollars.

301
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:05,726
Right.
I'll take another shot at him.

302
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,063
Thought you hated flowers.

303
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,899
Pulled up everything on Kristin
Donnelly's fiancé, Tommy Boyd.

304
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,282
- And?
- Skeletons in the closet.

305
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:22,324
Five years at Folsom State Prison
for armed robbery.

306
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:24,719
Served his full sentence.
Released in 2002.

307
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,998
Anyone else think Kristin's got
a thing for bad boys?

308
00:19:31,043 --> 00:19:32,110
Moving on.

309
00:19:32,152 --> 00:19:34,506
Boyd's records show an incident
where he was a minor.

310
00:19:34,752 --> 00:19:36,452
Underage drinking and a DUI.

311
00:19:36,652 --> 00:19:39,589
He was acquitted, but the details
of the case were sealed by the court.

312
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,304
Work with Eric, get it unsealed.

313
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:52,835
Kristin has no idea
she's marrying an ex-con.

314
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,123
- You don't know that.
- I know her.

315
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:58,067
She'd never go down that path again.

316
00:19:58,109 --> 00:20:00,829
It's not your place to look out for her.
She's a part of this case.

317
00:20:00,871 --> 00:20:03,076
And Boyd just drops into her life
after I leave?

318
00:20:03,604 --> 00:20:05,267
It could be a coincidence.

319
00:20:05,309 --> 00:20:07,747
Somebody dropped a hammer
on Gale and Donnelly.

320
00:20:08,414 --> 00:20:10,027
Perez making hits from prison.

321
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,714
It's a good theory.
It's not the only theory.

322
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:14,547
Do you think it's Boyd?

323
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,271
Or do you want it to be Boyd?

324
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:20,297
Just as you said, I'll be okay.

325
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,398
- What is this?
- I was thinking Ping-Pong.

326
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,384
Ping-Pong.

327
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,571
More specifically,
a Ping-Pong night.

328
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,321
Yeah, for the team outing.

329
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:41,281
And not to brag or anything, but...

330
00:20:41,525 --> 00:20:42,608
I'm really good.

331
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:44,659
Fortunately for you,
it's easy to pick up.

332
00:20:49,303 --> 00:20:50,290
Serve it up.

333
00:20:56,714 --> 00:20:57,638
There you go.

334
00:20:59,401 --> 00:21:01,838
- How's the case?
- Callen wants to work alone.

335
00:21:03,214 --> 00:21:05,914
Behavior that conflicts with one
of the fundamental tenets

336
00:21:05,956 --> 00:21:08,600
of a Navy SEAL's psychology:
teamwork.

337
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,145
One of the fundamental tenets
of G. Callen is to tackle things solo.

338
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,980
It's the way he makes sense
of the world.

339
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,742
He's been doing it his whole life.

340
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:17,567
You debrief him after every case.

341
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,319
You know what's not in the files.

342
00:21:20,324 --> 00:21:22,750
- And that's all you're gonna say?
- That's all I can say.

343
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,537
If it affects NCIS,
it's my job to speak up.

344
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:29,945
But as far as the innermost thoughts
of the field agents are concerned,

345
00:21:30,185 --> 00:21:32,860
it's my job to make sure
that they stay confidential.

346
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:37,597
He trusts you
more than anyone else, Sam.

347
00:21:40,303 --> 00:21:42,341
What if he doesn't need
my help this time?

348
00:21:42,865 --> 00:21:44,665
You'll be ready to offer it anyway.

349
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:48,556
What about the girl?

350
00:21:48,812 --> 00:21:49,949
Kristin Donnelly?

351
00:21:53,387 --> 00:21:54,799
Nothing he can't handle.

352
00:22:02,794 --> 00:22:05,865
Did I mention I have one of the sickest
topspin serves you've ever seen?

353
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:08,493
- Ready?
- Sure.

354
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,531
Free lesson?

355
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:16,012
Yeah, I just got...
I got to warm up next time.

356
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:17,752
'Cause I got... I have this...

357
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,393
this rotator cuff thing.
You ever get that? Like...

358
00:22:20,969 --> 00:22:22,893
When you're in the gym?
Probably not.

359
00:22:24,281 --> 00:22:26,131
Beat your ass at Pictionary.

360
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:30,488
Thank you, sir.

361
00:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,076
Right this way, ma'am.

362
00:22:35,525 --> 00:22:37,022
This isn't a social call.

363
00:22:37,106 --> 00:22:38,322
How did you guess?

364
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:42,472
The flowers weren't nice enough
to warrant a same day visit.

365
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:46,167
I hate flowers,
but the gesture didn't go unnoticed.

366
00:22:47,004 --> 00:22:48,992
What branch of NCIS
are you with, anyway?

367
00:22:49,354 --> 00:22:50,792
I made an inquiry...

368
00:22:50,967 --> 00:22:53,997
and got hit with the kind of clearance
requests you'd expect from Langley.

369
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,375
There's been another shooting.

370
00:22:58,620 --> 00:22:59,544
Jon Donnelly.

371
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,172
We think Montrell Perez may have had
something to do with it.

372
00:23:03,103 --> 00:23:04,227
May I ask why?

373
00:23:05,615 --> 00:23:08,127
I can think of
about five million reasons.

374
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:10,504
A less tactful attorney
might suggest

375
00:23:10,546 --> 00:23:13,359
your efforts are better spent trying
to locate this alleged hit man

376
00:23:13,401 --> 00:23:16,978
rather than assigning blame
to a prisoner already serving his time.

377
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,855
Perez is a legitimate suspect.

378
00:23:19,082 --> 00:23:21,274
And if you still want us
to support his appeal,

379
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,192
he needs to tell us
everything he knows.

380
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,236
He told me he'd talk to you anytime.

381
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,406
So long as it's face-to-face.

382
00:23:29,037 --> 00:23:30,825
And they say chivalry is dead.

383
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,372
- Just run it through my office first.
- Of course.

384
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,124
Thank you for the flowers.

385
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:40,877
You said you didn't like flowers.

386
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,699
I kind of like that you sent them.

387
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,449
- What are you doing here?
- Kristin doesn't know, does she?

388
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:05,699
Know what?

389
00:24:05,741 --> 00:24:07,443
That you got sent
to Folsom State Prison

390
00:24:07,485 --> 00:24:10,163
for a liquor store robbery
that left the owner paralyzed.

391
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,674
Look, I was 18. I'm not the guy
who pulled the trigger.

392
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,893
And it takes a hell of a lot more
than talking like a cop to rattle me.

393
00:24:24,989 --> 00:24:26,599
She'll leave me if she finds out.

394
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,829
She's had it with people
who disappoint her.

395
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,880
How'd you meet?

396
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,120
At a bar.

397
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:39,234
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to convince me

398
00:24:39,276 --> 00:24:41,654
that you had nothing to do
with Jon Donnelly's murder.

399
00:24:42,474 --> 00:24:43,804
That liquor store thing,

400
00:24:43,846 --> 00:24:46,221
I was a kid caught up
with the wrong crowd, all right?

401
00:24:46,263 --> 00:24:48,131
It's not an excuse,
it's what happened.

402
00:24:48,794 --> 00:24:51,406
But I served every day
of my sentence.

403
00:24:53,274 --> 00:24:54,694
We all make mistakes.

404
00:24:55,812 --> 00:24:56,576
We do.

405
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,592
But one mistake I'll never make
is walking out on Kristin.

406
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,845
That's more
than I can say for you...

407
00:25:07,334 --> 00:25:08,428
whoever you are.

408
00:25:25,543 --> 00:25:28,256
- At least he didn't shoot you.
- There is that.

409
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,448
You mind explaining how this visit
is connected to our case?

410
00:25:35,217 --> 00:25:36,743
Is my partner interrogating me?

411
00:25:37,052 --> 00:25:38,828
Your partner is watching your back.

412
00:25:42,197 --> 00:25:44,299
Something's wrong with this guy.
It's just...

413
00:25:45,187 --> 00:25:46,630
he's got some demons.

414
00:25:47,007 --> 00:25:48,120
Don't we all?

415
00:25:50,175 --> 00:25:53,548
He said he met Kristin in a bar, but
it just feels like there's more to it.

416
00:25:55,796 --> 00:25:57,349
Then there probably is.

417
00:25:59,263 --> 00:26:01,741
But he does seem to care
about Kristin and the boy.

418
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:05,930
I don't know.

419
00:26:07,072 --> 00:26:10,523
Four years ago, walking away seemed
like the right thing to do, but...

420
00:26:13,001 --> 00:26:14,774
I told her so many lies.

421
00:26:17,363 --> 00:26:18,727
The deeper you get,

422
00:26:19,574 --> 00:26:23,480
the easier it is to leave the lies
in place and just disappear.

423
00:26:27,548 --> 00:26:30,512
The best thing you can do
is find the man who killed her brother.

424
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:46,840
I got a call
from Miramar Naval Brigg.

425
00:26:47,107 --> 00:26:50,213
Perez just got a visit
from Andres Rodriguo.

426
00:26:50,255 --> 00:26:51,818
AKA Icy Andres.

427
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,958
He's a Fourth Street Flats enforcer

428
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,657
who's a prime suspect in,
I don't know, eight homicides.

429
00:26:58,079 --> 00:27:00,326
Now, unfortunately,
police can't make anything stick

430
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,919
due to the fact
that witnesses against Senior Icy

431
00:27:02,961 --> 00:27:06,457
tend to suffer from such maladies
as unnatural strangulation,

432
00:27:06,684 --> 00:27:08,459
untimely dismemberment,

433
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,186
and unfortunate spills down
empty elevator shafts.

434
00:27:11,228 --> 00:27:13,603
Am I the only one who thinks
he delivers that information

435
00:27:13,645 --> 00:27:16,050
- a little too cheerfully?
- Hey, don't hate.

436
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:17,302
I love my job.

437
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:19,956
Question Perez again,
but don't tell his lawyer.

438
00:27:20,128 --> 00:27:21,806
Let's see how he does
without coaching.

439
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,042
Go behind Corby's back?

440
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,536
Intrigue. Betrayal.
This is getting good.

441
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:29,579
Sometimes he's so cheerful,
I just want to punch him.

442
00:27:29,621 --> 00:27:30,481
Repeatedly.

443
00:27:30,957 --> 00:27:33,735
Since Corby said
Perez will see you anytime, then...

444
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:35,111
he doesn't need to know.

445
00:27:35,969 --> 00:27:39,027
Have another sit-down, smile a lot,
look like you're interested.

446
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:40,580
Be still my beating heart.

447
00:27:40,622 --> 00:27:43,152
Another chance to hear
the latest penitentiary pickup lines.

448
00:27:43,685 --> 00:27:46,287
We dress you in something tight.

449
00:27:46,478 --> 00:27:50,043
He will be so bewitched and bothered,
he won't even notice

450
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:53,254
when you plant
this little bug on him.

451
00:28:01,505 --> 00:28:02,221
Nice.

452
00:28:03,827 --> 00:28:06,682
- You put that on just for me?
- Sure, I did.

453
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:10,229
Jon Donnelly was killed
in a drive-by shooting this afternoon.

454
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:13,489
<i>It's tragic.</i>

455
00:28:14,147 --> 00:28:16,296
<i>You're the only one
in that crew that isn't dead.</i>

456
00:28:16,338 --> 00:28:19,151
<i>And you don't seem to be too scared
about being next.</i>

457
00:28:19,952 --> 00:28:20,894
<i>Scared?</i>

458
00:28:22,023 --> 00:28:22,742
<i>Right.</i>

459
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:24,298
<i>I'm a big dog in here.</i>

460
00:28:24,925 --> 00:28:25,882
Untouchable.

461
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:29,419
To most.

462
00:28:35,421 --> 00:28:37,169
Do you like having me here?

463
00:28:39,823 --> 00:28:42,962
Then give me something I can use
or I'm gone.

464
00:28:44,586 --> 00:28:46,024
What do you want to know?

465
00:28:47,307 --> 00:28:48,976
What happened
to the money you stole?

466
00:28:52,032 --> 00:28:52,980
Off the record?

467
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:54,878
Sure.

468
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:01,357
We stole five mil.

469
00:29:02,725 --> 00:29:04,782
Four-point-five of
which I never saw again.

470
00:29:05,184 --> 00:29:07,812
<i>- What happened to the difference?
- In a bank.</i>

471
00:29:08,354 --> 00:29:09,575
<i>Got my name on it.</i>

472
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,743
I'm gonna tell you something
I haven't told anybody before.

473
00:29:13,547 --> 00:29:15,545
Not even that JAG lawyer of mine,
Corby.

474
00:29:16,437 --> 00:29:19,715
Four years ago, the night
before the trial, I got a phone call.

475
00:29:19,867 --> 00:29:21,653
Guy on the line was wearing

476
00:29:21,695 --> 00:29:24,682
one of those voice distorter things.
He told me I was going down,

477
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:28,784
but I could walk away with some cash

478
00:29:29,312 --> 00:29:31,352
if I did my time,
kept my mouth shut.

479
00:29:31,926 --> 00:29:34,013
Do you have any idea
who it might have been?

480
00:29:36,658 --> 00:29:39,277
Could have been
any of a dozen guys who knew.

481
00:29:39,361 --> 00:29:41,110
Bunch of my old Flats boys.

482
00:29:41,682 --> 00:29:44,407
Maybe even this bent MP
named Tedrow.

483
00:29:45,161 --> 00:29:46,951
Gale and Donnelly
said they got calls, too.

484
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:50,315
They told the guy no. Thought they'd do
their time, get out, find the money.

485
00:29:51,459 --> 00:29:52,820
Guess they were wrong.

486
00:29:56,036 --> 00:29:57,044
Is that all?

487
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:58,629
For today.

488
00:29:59,525 --> 00:30:01,195
You think I'm coming back?

489
00:30:02,602 --> 00:30:03,593
I sure do.

490
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:05,927
It'll be like <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>,

491
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:09,190
only you're hotter
than the FBI chick...

492
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:12,477
and I'm a lot smarter
than the creepy old killer guy.

493
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,653
Call me.

494
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,382
Our killer started working on his plan
four years ago.

495
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:30,892
He spoke to Perez and the others
before the trial.

496
00:30:30,934 --> 00:30:32,464
<i>"Call me", you see that?</i>

497
00:30:32,804 --> 00:30:35,016
Sounds like he had inside information
on the case.

498
00:30:35,058 --> 00:30:36,918
<i>They all like the bad boys,
you know that.</i>

499
00:30:39,095 --> 00:30:41,632
You promised you'd run all visits
with Perez through me first.

500
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:42,465
I'm sorry.

501
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,744
Someone must have screwed up
at the office.

502
00:30:45,757 --> 00:30:47,959
Munro, what is it with you, man?
You jealous?

503
00:30:48,132 --> 00:30:49,972
I'm trying to kick it
to this hot agent, man.

504
00:30:50,164 --> 00:30:51,141
In your dreams.

505
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,591
No, you saw the way
<i>she touched my shoulder, man.</i>

506
00:30:54,506 --> 00:30:55,311
<i>Perez?</i>

507
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:56,812
<i>Perez!</i>

508
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,098
<i>Get a medic, now!</i>

509
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,031
<i>Get back in there.</i>

510
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,164
- His pulse is fading fast.
- What happened?

511
00:31:15,598 --> 00:31:17,551
He started choking and collapsed!

512
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,878
Who was the man on the phone?
Perez!

513
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,635
Who took the money?

514
00:31:29,975 --> 00:31:30,958
It's too late.

515
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,455
<i>He's dead.</i>

516
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:37,715
Initial toxicology results
indicate that Perez was poisoned.

517
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:39,533
Sodium cyanide.

518
00:31:39,575 --> 00:31:42,455
It's a colorless salt
that induces cardiac arrest.

519
00:31:42,497 --> 00:31:44,110
Slip it
into someone's food or drink,

520
00:31:44,194 --> 00:31:45,861
and it can take hours to kill them.

521
00:31:46,307 --> 00:31:48,322
I got something
on Kristin Donnelly's fiancé.

522
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,367
Remember that sealed case
on Tommy Boyd's record?

523
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:53,111
The DUI he got as a minor.

524
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:56,080
I finally managed to access
the court records and get it unsealed.

525
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,584
Tommy was acquitted
due to a technicality.

526
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,656
His court-assigned lawyer
discovered an error

527
00:32:01,698 --> 00:32:05,047
in the arrest paperwork and got
the prosecutor to seal the case.

528
00:32:05,275 --> 00:32:07,300
That's pretty good
for a public defender.

529
00:32:09,007 --> 00:32:10,219
It was Neil Corby.

530
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:25,413
Corby's a former Navy Petty Officer.

531
00:32:25,455 --> 00:32:29,447
After graduating law school, he went
the public defender route for four years

532
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,777
and then decided
he was a military man at heart.

533
00:32:32,285 --> 00:32:33,464
Next stop was JAG.

534
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,287
Perez said he didn't tell
anyone about the phone call.

535
00:32:36,834 --> 00:32:38,252
But Corby knew about it.

536
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:42,174
So either Perez was lying to me,
trying to make me feel special...

537
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:45,671
or Corby knows more about this case
than he's letting on.

538
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:50,943
I hate flowers.

539
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:28,297
- You and Neil Corby...
- And don't hold back.

540
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:31,266
What, you bring him along to lay
a beating on me? Is that what this is?

541
00:33:33,749 --> 00:33:37,389
He saved my ass on a DUI charge
when I was 17. I owed him.

542
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,896
I kept in touch.

543
00:33:39,241 --> 00:33:40,975
I mean, the way my life was headed,

544
00:33:41,192 --> 00:33:43,646
I figured I could use a lawyer
who was a buddy and

545
00:33:43,731 --> 00:33:46,083
four years ago, he...
he called in the favor.

546
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:48,233
He wanted me to get close to a girl.

547
00:33:48,517 --> 00:33:51,116
- Kristin Donnelly.
- The woman you supposedly met in a bar.

548
00:33:51,307 --> 00:33:53,780
No, I did. He told me
where she would be, and he sent me in.

549
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,282
- Why?
- To keep tabs on her brother, Jon.

550
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,828
Apparently,
he just got sent to prison, and

551
00:33:58,913 --> 00:34:01,538
Corby seemed to think that he might
have known about missing money,

552
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,032
but as far as I could tell, Jon didn't
know anything and neither did Kristin.

553
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:06,309
And you fell for her.

554
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:08,421
When she told me she was pregnant,

555
00:34:08,731 --> 00:34:10,238
I figured it was meant to be.

556
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,447
Her and that boy, they're my family.

557
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:17,002
I mean,
it doesn't matter how it started...

558
00:34:18,381 --> 00:34:20,086
they're all I care about now.

559
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,062
Is she in some kind
of danger from Corby?

560
00:34:26,431 --> 00:34:27,901
Why should I believe you?

561
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:30,901
'Cause you're not the only one
that cares about her.

562
00:34:43,165 --> 00:34:46,606
Corby represented Perez in the trial.
He had inside information about.

563
00:34:46,648 --> 00:34:48,603
Got to the money,
switched it to another account.

564
00:34:48,645 --> 00:34:51,881
Got nervous that Donnelly might find out
so he hired Boyd to keep an eye on him.

565
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,300
But in the end, it was Joey Gale
who put it all together.

566
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:57,134
- We'd better talk to Kensi.
- Yeah.

567
00:35:22,431 --> 00:35:23,220
Thanks.

568
00:35:25,034 --> 00:35:26,726
Thank you for meeting me.

569
00:35:27,421 --> 00:35:28,767
I have to apologize.

570
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:31,837
I'm very sorry about Perez.

571
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,549
Well, this isn't exactly the way
I envisioned our first date, but...

572
00:35:39,337 --> 00:35:40,805
The case has hit a dead end.

573
00:35:42,871 --> 00:35:45,325
There was another guy
who got arrested four years ago.

574
00:35:45,367 --> 00:35:47,394
A crooked MP, Jason Tedrow.

575
00:35:48,238 --> 00:35:51,439
- I read his name in the case file.
- He just got released from Charleston.

576
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,526
- All right, I'll check him out.
- I already did.

577
00:35:53,854 --> 00:35:55,152
Several times.

578
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:57,601
Every time I went to Charleston
to visit one of my clients

579
00:35:57,643 --> 00:36:00,140
over the past 4 years,
I made it a point to try to meet him.

580
00:36:00,649 --> 00:36:03,169
One time, the warden told me
Tedrow was in the infirmary.

581
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:05,578
Another time,
Tedrow was on work duty.

582
00:36:05,709 --> 00:36:07,514
He was even in solitary once.

583
00:36:07,894 --> 00:36:09,851
With Jason Tedrow,
it was always something.

584
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,157
Man's like a ghost.

585
00:36:11,388 --> 00:36:14,621
So, now that he's out,
you can see why I've taken an interest.

586
00:36:14,882 --> 00:36:17,842
Yes, certainly does
sound suspicious.

587
00:36:17,926 --> 00:36:18,915
It does.

588
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:24,056
I started considering
all the possibilities with Tedrow,

589
00:36:24,398 --> 00:36:25,834
and I landed on this one.

590
00:36:26,396 --> 00:36:29,362
There's this story,
it's passed around the JAG guys.

591
00:36:29,887 --> 00:36:32,319
NCIS has an undercover operator

592
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:35,276
who can turn himself into anyone
at any time for any reason.

593
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,243
Gets his man, then he's gone.

594
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:40,177
Like some urban legend.
Doesn't even have a real name.

595
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:41,949
Just... "Callen".

596
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:45,619
Yeah, I'm not a huge fan
of urban legends.

597
00:36:46,895 --> 00:36:50,061
I know there was
an undercover NCIS element

598
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:51,709
involved in the case 4 years ago.

599
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,002
I think...

600
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:56,161
Jason Tedrow and Callen

601
00:36:56,435 --> 00:36:57,942
are the same guy.

602
00:36:58,867 --> 00:37:00,519
Which means you...

603
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,641
are wearing a wire...

604
00:37:02,683 --> 00:37:05,806
and he is listening
to every word of this.

605
00:37:06,095 --> 00:37:09,018
So, either he shows
his face right now

606
00:37:09,703 --> 00:37:13,643
or I pull the trigger and leave you
bleeding out all over that seat.

607
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:20,860
<i>Why is Boyd here?</i>

608
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:23,449
- What are you doing?
- I followed you from your house.

609
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,367
I'm making sure
you don't hurt Kristin.

610
00:37:25,457 --> 00:37:27,537
She doesn't know where the money is.

611
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:28,931
Turn around, walk away.

612
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:31,165
Look, whatever favor
I owed you is paid.

613
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:34,418
- It's not that easy.
- Yeah? I figured you'd say that.

614
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:35,895
He's got a gun!

615
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,979
You want to shoot a federal agent,
you go right ahead.

616
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:53,187
Let her go!

617
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:54,605
Get down!

618
00:38:03,958 --> 00:38:05,240
Okay, hang in there.

619
00:38:05,325 --> 00:38:07,743
I gotcha. Hang in there.
You're okay, you're all right.

620
00:38:10,163 --> 00:38:12,957
It's not that bad. You'll be okay.
Come on. Ambulance is on the way.

621
00:38:15,287 --> 00:38:16,418
That's him, isn't it?

622
00:38:20,557 --> 00:38:21,876
I never heard of him.

623
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,644
Hang in there.

624
00:38:36,293 --> 00:38:37,830
I had to protect her.

625
00:38:38,278 --> 00:38:39,178
You did.

626
00:38:39,965 --> 00:38:40,894
I win,

627
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,196
right?

628
00:38:58,497 --> 00:39:01,526
I don't know this Jason Tedrow guy,
but he's becoming a pain in my ass.

629
00:39:02,246 --> 00:39:03,339
Is he retired now?

630
00:39:04,484 --> 00:39:05,321
Almost.

631
00:39:12,054 --> 00:39:13,682
- Good job.
- Thanks.

632
00:39:18,527 --> 00:39:20,232
Congratulations are in order.

633
00:39:21,586 --> 00:39:23,334
Jason Tedrow has

634
00:39:23,506 --> 00:39:25,812
officially ridden off
into the sunset.

635
00:39:30,259 --> 00:39:31,485
What about Kristin?

636
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:33,912
She has her son, Michael.

637
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:37,707
Is there anything you don't know?

638
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:38,769
Plenty.

639
00:39:39,993 --> 00:39:42,857
But whether such things
are worth knowing, however,

640
00:39:43,017 --> 00:39:44,182
is debatable.

641
00:39:45,859 --> 00:39:47,009
What do I do?

642
00:39:49,942 --> 00:39:51,609
Ask yourself a question.

643
00:39:52,591 --> 00:39:53,413
"Which

644
00:39:54,212 --> 00:39:55,479
I is I?"

645
00:39:56,092 --> 00:39:57,774
Then tell her the truth.

646
00:39:58,526 --> 00:40:00,832
I'm certain she'll return the favor.

647
00:40:04,029 --> 00:40:05,353
Which truth?

648
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,928
The one that sets you free.

649
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,278
What are you drawing?

650
00:40:22,826 --> 00:40:23,989
Looks good.

651
00:40:30,165 --> 00:40:31,762
- Hi.
- I'm sorry for showing up.

652
00:40:31,846 --> 00:40:34,116
I just...
I probably should've called.

653
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:35,933
Why start now?

654
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,477
How's Tommy?

655
00:40:38,717 --> 00:40:40,729
Doctors say
he can come home tomorrow.

656
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,399
He's a good man.

657
00:40:46,589 --> 00:40:47,639
Yes, he is.

658
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,109
Michael's not your son.

659
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:07,239
I should've told you the moment
you came back, but I was so angry.

660
00:41:10,721 --> 00:41:12,131
I wanted you to wonder.

661
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:15,214
I wanted you to suffer
like I had after you left.

662
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,166
That was wrong.

663
00:41:22,096 --> 00:41:23,272
One last thing, I...

664
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:29,056
My real name...

665
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,129
Good-bye...

666
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,045
What?

667
00:42:16,690 --> 00:42:18,220
We were waiting on you.

668
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:19,259
Why?

669
00:42:20,115 --> 00:42:21,593
The team outing, remember?

670
00:42:21,896 --> 00:42:23,231
Dom made reservations.

671
00:42:23,808 --> 00:42:25,709
Do I even want to know
what he chose?

672
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:27,377
I chose.

673
00:42:27,991 --> 00:42:30,926
I hope you all enjoy karaoke
as much as I do.

674
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:33,132
But if not,

675
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:34,333
deal with it.

676
00:42:35,603 --> 00:42:36,708
Come on.

677
00:42:38,215 --> 00:42:39,344
You don't have to.

678
00:42:40,179 --> 00:42:43,317
And miss the opportunity to show up
your pathetic Mick Jagger impersonation

679
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,297
with my Springsteen?
Not a chance.

680
00:42:45,339 --> 00:42:47,519
You, Springsteen?
This I gotta hear.

681
00:42:48,084 --> 00:42:49,165
Where's Dom?

682
00:42:49,207 --> 00:42:50,911
I don't know,
meeting us there, I guess.

683
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:54,096
I bet he doesn't show.
Bet he's got himself a hot date instead.

684
00:42:54,138 --> 00:42:56,590
Guess he'll just have to hear you
some other time, Hetty.

685
00:42:56,632 --> 00:42:58,044
What are you going to sing?

686
00:42:58,752 --> 00:43:01,276
I thought a little Ella Fitzgerald.

687
00:43:01,778 --> 00:43:05,192
I've been told
I sound just like her.

688
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,136
