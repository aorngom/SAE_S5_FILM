IT WAS COOL BECAUSE
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME

694
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,500
WE WERE EVER A REAL FAMILY.

695
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,733

YOU?

697
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:39,566
MY EIGHTH BIRTHDAY.
MY MOM WAS STILL ALIVE.

698
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,333
THAT'S THE LAST TIME
WE WERE A REAL FAMILY.
