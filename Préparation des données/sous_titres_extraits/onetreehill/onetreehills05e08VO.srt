1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:02,250
previously on one tree hill.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,410
here is to our crew and to everyone getting what they want.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,600
Alice is considering me for an on-air position,

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:10,630
and those are hard to get.

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,540
I'm really glad brooke set us up.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,370
kiss her and ur fired.

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,760
Haven't you learned?

8
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,360
You only get off when i do.

9
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:24,290
This is over.

10
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,810
Then you're fired.

11
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,390
You're just upset because the talent left your band.

12
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:31,590
He's not worth it,okay?

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,390
Let it go!

14
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,510
You're lucky.

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,810
I'm a little drunk,so in case I said a lot of inappropriate things tonight,

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,140
I meant all of them.

17
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,870
Peyton's the reason you're writing again,

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,590
and I refuse to be a chapter in that book.

19
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,550
Lindsey.Lindsey,wait.

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,370
I asked you to marry me.

21
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:50,090
You said no,so I moved on.

22
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,610
Why haven't you?

23
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:53,550
'Cause I should have said yes.

you still love me,don't you?

28
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,500
I have to go see lindsey.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,370
lindsey?

30
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,770
I'm gonna go to new york,lucas.

31
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,180
I'm not sure when I'll be back.

32
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,770
Don't do this.

33
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,260
I know you're upset.I know.

34
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:02,810
But you need to believe me when I tell you,

35
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:05,860
you're the girl I love.

36
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,770
Then how come you never gave me this?

37
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,370
I got home,and I thought I'd do some menial chore to get my mind off of how angry I was.

38
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,680
Laundry was the first thing that came to mind.

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,040
God.

40
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,700
Who hides a ring in a sock drawer,luke?

41
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:34,650
Lindsey,that ring -- 

42
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,590
don'T.I'm just gonna go.

43
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,120
For the record.

44
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,160
it's as beautiful as I imagined it would be.

45
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,070
Take it.

46
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,460
I was waiting to give you the ring

47
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,870
until I was sure I had another book in me.

48
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:09,340
I just don't want you to end up regretting me because I can't finish.

49
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,730
I would never regret you.

50
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,590
Yeah,you say that now.

51
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,940
But what if I'm not lucas the writer?

52
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:19,670
What if I'm lucas the small-time basketball coach?

53
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,630
What if that's all I'm ever gonna be?

54
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,790
Then I'd be the small-town basketball coach's wife.

55
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,570
Look at me,lucas.

56
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,660
I don't love you for your book.

57
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,340
I love you for the mind that book sprang from.

58
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,760
And I don't care if you never write another word again.

59
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,620
You will always be more than a small-town basketball coach.

60
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,400
because you'll be the man that I love.

61
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,790
Lindsey.

62
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,730
evelyn strauss.

63
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,540
will you marry me?

64
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,610
lindsey,um.

65
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,040
I'm sorry.I never wanted -- 

66
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,460
lucas asked me to marry him.

67
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:26,210
Are you awake?

68
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,960
No.

69
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,130
Sorry I got upset with you.

70
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:39,060
You had a right to be upset.

71
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:41,990
I finally started walking again.

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,090
I've got no business being in some guy's face.

73
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,710
Lucas kissed peyton.

74
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,660
What?

75
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,100
When?

76
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,430
Before we left tric,in peyton's office.

77
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,010
I walked in,and I saw the whole thing,or enough of it.

78
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,860
I don't understand how lucas can do that to lindsey

79
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,170
after everything that they've been through.

80
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,670
And peyton,who does she think she is?

81
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,070
She turned down lucas' proposal.

82
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,210
She broke his heart.

83
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,360
She has no right to take him from lindsey.

84
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:22,210
Maybe it wasn'tat wh it looked like.

85
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,560
Maybe it was just a friendly kiss,or maybe it was a goodbye kiss.

86
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:28,760
Maybe it was just a mistake.

87
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,520
No,I know what I saw.

88
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,680
This was a full-on romantic lucas/peyton kiss.

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,350
You should forget what you saw.

90
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,350
Oh,really,forget it?

91
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,450
No,what I need to do is tell lindsey.

92
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,490
See,that's not your place,regardless of what it looked like.

93
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,990
I mean,look,if lucas is cheating on lindsey,

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,730
then he needs to be man enough to tell her himself.

95
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,080
You know,of all the guys I dated in new york,

96
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,770
not one of them ever named a shot after me.

97
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,000
I think it kind of separates you from all the rich,

98
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:19,650
handsome,famous,successful,educated types.

99
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,000
Flatter me all you want.

100
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,430
You're still cut off.

101
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:26,210
Listen,pal,my name is technically a brand,

102
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:30,600
so I could sue you for naming that shot after me.

103
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,400
First of all,you named the shot after yourself.

104
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,830
Second of all,that shot was the patricia foster last week,

105
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,570
the liz thompson the week before.

106
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,550
Chances are,it'll have a new name tomorrow night,

107
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,500
so if you want to sue me,better do it fast.

108
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,120
Well,if my name's only gonna be on it for the night.

109
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:52,310
maybe there's something else I should do real fast.

110
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,320
I think you are way too full of yourself to make that kind of decision.

111
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,640
Hi,P.Sawyer.

112
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,580
Please tell me those are tears of joy.

113
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,200
Okay,no.

114
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:07,460
I'm coming home right now.

115
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,050
Ooh,not so fast,headline waiting to happen.

116
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,660
I'll drop you off.

117
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,560
You do like me.

118
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:17,170
No,you driving drunk is just something I actually can get sued for.

119
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:36,780
Leave a message.

120
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,510
Hi,uh,millicent,it's -- it's mouth,marvin.mouth.

121
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,660
Um,I just wanted you to know I had a really nice time with you tonight,

122
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,640
and I'm sorry if it ended weird or if you felt bad,

123
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:49,050
not that you should feel bad.

124
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,460
I should feel bad.

125
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:51,990
I do feel bad.

126
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,920
So.call me.

127
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,720
Marvin -- mouth.

128
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,530
I mean,you should call me,and my name is marvin or mouth,

129
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,890
not you should call me marvin.

130
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,460
I just w-- 

131
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,030
Tell me you are not lying here,

132
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:19,950
torturing yourself with a copy of lucas' book.

133
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,550
In that moment,my triumph was not a state championship.

134
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,110
but a moment of clarity.

135
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,570
I've read it,honey.I know how it ends.

136
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:39,180
That's funny.

137
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,970
Because it seems like lucas has forgotten.

138
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:48,000
Oh,brooke,he asked lindsey to marry him.

139
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,480
What?

140
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,920
That's crazy.

141
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,410
Maybe.Or maybe crazy is me thinking that --

142
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,770
that he could still have feelings for me after all these years.

143
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:02,050
But we both know lucas has a history of 

144
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,380
throwing himself into the wrong relationship,

145
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:08,240
especially when he can't admit the truth about who he loves.

146
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,670
No.

147
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,040
It's different this time.

148
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,060
Okay.

149
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:22,540
What am I supposed to do?

150
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,990
Come here.

151
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,340
first,you're gonna let go.

152
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,000
and now we're gonna sit,

153
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:02,490
and you are gonna cry on my shoulder for as long as you need to,okay?

154
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,770
Come here.

155
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,970
Suddenly,it was as if the roar of the crowd,

156
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,460
the echo of the final buzzer,

157
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:16,920
the cheers of my teammates were all sounding from a thousand miles away.

158
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:26,090
and what remained in that bizarre muffled silence was only peyton,

159
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:30,050
the girl whose art and passion and beauty had changed my life.

160
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,680
In that moment,my triumph was not a state championship,

161
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,660
but simple clarity,

162
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,640
the realization that we had always been meant for each other,

163
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,110
and every instinct to the contrary had simply been a denial of the following truth.

164
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:57,070
I was now and would always be.

165
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,430
in love with peyton sawyer.

166
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,070
I'm really sorry we're late.

167
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,620
Hey,no tv for you and no ice cream until the afternoon.

168
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:18,650
Keep it to one scoop,okay?

169
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:20,640
One.

170
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:21,960
Okay.

171
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,900
You forgot.

172
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,670
It's fine!

173
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,340
You look so handsome!

174
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,300
Okay,um,your dad's gonna pick you up after practice.All right?

175
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:31,800
Bye.

176
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,470
Thank you.

177
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,670
Bye.

178
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,570
Haley,so glad you're here.

179
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:39,660
Oh,I've got to go,actually,but is everything okay?

180
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,190
Oh,everything's great,I mean,

181
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,130
as long as this town's big enough for two mrs.Scotts.

182
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:48,480
Oh,my god.

183
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,850
Congratulations!

184
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,740
Hangover?

185
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,600
More like teetering on the edge of death.

186
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,320
Don't you need that?

187
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,680
I'll brew more.

188
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,730
Thanks.

189
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,580
Listen,I don't remember much of last night,

190
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,990
but I have a feeling I was less than professional.

191
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,760
It was probably my fault for not cutting you off.

192
00:13:25,310 --> 00:13:29,780
On the bright side,at least your drunken mistake didn't ruin your basketball career.

193
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,880
Did it ruin my nanny career?

194
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,950
You got to stop the flirting,carrie,

195
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,220
and the skinny-dipping and --

196
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:42,070
I think the severity of this hangover pretty much guarantees it'll never happen again.

197
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,150
I hope that's true.

198
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,740
Drin oentyf water.

199
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:00,640
Hey,mouth -- what are you doing?

200
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,460
Uh,well,the thing is --

201
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,860
did you hear about alice?

202
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,280
She got fired.

203
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,450
What?

204
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,270
When?

205
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,420
First thing this morning.

206
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,480
She's already gone.

207
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,880
How great is that?

208
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,310
That is greater than you know

209
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,220
So,what happened?

210
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:16,130
Do you think they found out about how abusive she was?

211
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,300
Not exactly.

212
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,800
Apparently,she was sleeping with an employee.

213
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,010
They're totally,like,cleaning house.

214
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:40,410
Man,we ain't gonna never beat la salle if you gonna be late.

215
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:43,320
Actually,we're never gonna beat la salle,even if you're on time.

216
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:47,890
Maybe I should have spent last night planning a strategy to win instead of getting engaged,huh?

217
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,820
Definitely.

218
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,840
Wait.Hold on.Did you just say engaged?

219
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:56,100
Congratulations,big brother.

220
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,320
That's awesome.

221
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,270
No doubt,baby.

222
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,410
Way to go.

223
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,330
So,who's the lucky girl?

224
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,590
You're kidding,right?

225
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,630
No,that's a legit question.

226
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,180
With peyton back in town,it could be anybody's ballgame.

227
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:08,370
Could even be brooke.

228
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,540
Stop.

229
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,720
It's lindsey.

230
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:13,150
Excellent choice.

231
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,300
Things might work out for you after all.

232
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:21,980
Maybe not.

233
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:24,930
Do you see what I'm talking about?

234
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,460
You can't just hit people.

235
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,560
Man,all I know is ms.James-scott needed somebody to defend her honor,

236
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,780
and her own husband wasn't man enough to do it.

237
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:33,120
Let me tell you something --

238
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:37,780
my wife's honor is not something that can be taken away by some loudmouth jackass in a bar.

239
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,770
What can be taken away is your ability to play.

240
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,770
It looks like jit'sust a sprain.

241
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,650
Could be a few days.

242
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,980
It could be a month.

243
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,460
That's just great.

244
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,290
That's a hell of a punch,Q.

245
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,290
You might have taken out a whole team with it.

246
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,690
If you wanted to break my heart,

247
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,110
there are a thousand ways you could do it.

248
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:08,400
You did not have to propose to lindsey to hurt me.

249
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,960
It didn't have anything to do with you.

250
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,630
It's just weird timing.

251
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,100
Weird timing.

252
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,060
Okay,luke.

253
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,900
I know that it must seem like --

254
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:26,240
no,don't marry her,luke!

255
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,900
Peyton,you can't --

256
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,720
am I crazy?

257
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,840
Do you not feel what I have felt every day

258
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,590
that we've been apart for the last three years?

259
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:40,000
Because I have felt there is this vital piece of me that's been missing.

260
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:41,780
And I tried to fill it,luke.

261
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,480
I tried to fill it.

262
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,710
with work and friends and music,

263
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,440
and it stayed empty until last night when you kissed me,

264
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,620
and my entire universe snapped back into focus.

265
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,430
Lucas,look me in the eye and tell me that

266
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,250
that kiss did not ctel exaly the same as it felt three years ago.

267
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,730
I'm in love with her,peyton.

268
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,010
What is going on here?

269
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,740
Um,just congratulating luke.

270
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,890
Did you hear he's engaged?

271
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,350
Yeah,I'm gonna be her matron of honor.

272
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,940
Luke,I need to talk to you alone.

273
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,830
Something you want to tell me?

274
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,910
Is this a trick question?

275
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,100
Luke,marriage is a huge commitment.

276
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:03,520
Can you honestly tell me that you're positive lindsey's the one?

277
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:04,960
Okay,I know where this igoing.

278
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:09,120
To tell you the truth,lindsey will always be my number two.

279
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:14,420
but only because you are my number one.

280
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,050
And you always will be.Just don't tell lindsey or nathan.

281
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,470
Marriage is serious,

282
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,790
and you better be ready to commit to lindsey for the rest of your life.

283
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,990
Does that mean you're happy for me?

284
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,760
Get the doctor!

285
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,810
Nurse!

286
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,650
Mama said no tv.

287
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,430
What mama doesn't know won't hurt her.

288
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:37,420
She's okay.

289
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:40,320
We've set the monitor to notify of any changes.

290
00:18:41,650 --> 00:18:44,170
Let me know if adrian tells lexi they harvested the wrong lung.

291
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,900
You know he's going to.

292
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,650
Can I help you?

293
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,060
Looking for a gift for this girl I know.

294
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:56,250
Well,you've definitely come to the right place.

295
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,290
What's this girl look like?

296
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,730
Dark hair,hazel eyes.

297
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,210
If she didn't already own it.

298
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,710
I bet she'd like this one.

299
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,610
Yeah,but she's a little taller than you,

300
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,710
so do you have any other sizes?

301
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,380
Brooke,it's victoria.

302
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,450
She's settinga meeting for you with a furrier.

303
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,080
One sec.

304
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:24,270
Apparently,furs are about to make an unprecedented comeback.

305
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:24,940
Really?

306
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,180
Jamie,cover your ears.

307
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,530
Let's make this short and sweet.

308
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,860
There is no situation in which I am going to kill furry woodland creatures 

309
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:35,730
to make coats out of them,okay?

310
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,320
Thanks.

311
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,200
Let me guess --

312
00:19:41,210 --> 00:19:42,940
bar hag's still calling the shots?

313
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,460
Aren't you supposed to be shopping for some fugly giantess?

314
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:50,770
I'm just saying,why do you work with her if she makes you that crazy?

315
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:55,350
Well,first of all,the bar hag,as you call her,is my mother.

316
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,080
And second of all,she's my business partner.

317
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,900
And if it weren't for her,I wouldn't have a bazillion-dollar company,

318
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,890
a magazine,and all these lovely clothes you see here.

319
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:08,170
My mother wanted me to be an orthodontist,but I just said no.

320
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,230
Judging from your car,maybe you should have reconsidered.

321
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,740
A jab against my car.

322
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,960
You're that girl,huh?

323
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,470
That's disappointing.

324
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,530
What's underneath all the clothes,brooke davis?

325
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,890
Hey,peyton,it's me -- molly.

326
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,730
I -- I live in your old bedroom.

327
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:47,390
Right,keeper of my closet door,hey.

328
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:49,960
If I'd known other people would be reading everything I wrote on that thing,

329
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,790
I probably would have been more careful.

330
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,140
Well,I'm glad you weren'T.

331
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,910
I wanted to ask,did lucas really carry you out of the library after you got shot?

332
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,320
Um,yeah.

333
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,020
That must have been so romantic.

334
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:05,780
Well,I was actually kind of preoccupied bleeding out on the library carpet,so.

335
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:08,020
didn't really think about that.

336
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:10,920
I don't remember writing that part down on my closet doors.

337
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,290
Oh,right,of course.

338
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,480
I've read it 13 times.

339
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:18,540
Is that weird?

340
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,150
Well,it's just that,

341
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,370
when we moved into our new house and I read your closet door,

342
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,060
I knew it was special.

343
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,810
Then I read this book.

344
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,290
And I realized I was part of this timeless love story.

345
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,570
The truth is,sometimes,I read that door,

346
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:34,370
and I imagine that I have your life instead of mine.

347
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,580
No,molly,I am not someone you want to live vicariously through,okay?

348
00:21:37,590 --> 00:21:39,440
I'm -- I'm a mess.

349
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,310
Lucas scott didn't think so.

350
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:45,830
And besides,even if you are,no one's ever gonna write about my life.

351
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,630
It's marvin,right?

352
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,920
Yes,sir.

353
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,620
I suppose you heard we had to fire alice day for carrying on an inappropriate relationship with a subordinate.

354
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,890
I suppose you know a little something about that.

355
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,010
Yes,sir.I -- 

356
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,450
it's okay,son.

357
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,540
Apparently,half the station knew about alice and rick.

358
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,690
Rick?

359
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,090
Evening news anchorman rick?

360
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,250
I know.

361
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,530
Programming director sleeping with her anchor --

362
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,600
oh,boy.

363
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,800
Competition's gonna love that,huh?

364
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,170
I'm sorry -- rick,with the toupee,rick?

365
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,970
Listen,marvin.

366
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,040
we're in a bit of a scramble here.

367
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:40,510
We're gonna need all hands on deck.

368
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:42,870
I watched your audition tape.

369
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,650
It's good.

370
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,810
You know,the tree hill ravens have their season opener coming up.

371
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:50,090
How would you like to cover it?

372
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,790
Yes,sir.Yes.

373
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,170
Good man.

374
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,380
Thank you.

375
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,360
Uh,mcfadden,word of advice --

376
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:03,580
therrtoppounity here for a kid who will work hard and keep his nose clean.

377
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,550
Yes,sir.

378
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,160
What did they say?

379
00:23:13,170 --> 00:23:14,290
Do they know about carlton?

380
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,450
What about carlton?

381
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,880
He was giving it to alice.

382
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,430
What -- you didn't know?

383
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,420
They said she was ngsleepi with rick.

384
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:21,710
Really?

385
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,380
Wait,wait,wait.

386
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,090
Anchorman rick with the toupee?

387
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,420
So she was sleeping with carlton,too?

388
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,710
Oh,yeah.

389
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,820
Hey,mouth.

390
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,900
they didn't say anything about me,did they?

391
00:23:32,910 --> 00:23:34,340
No,why would they s--

392
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,030
you were sleeping with her,too?

393
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,150
Just a few mornings before work.

394
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:43,110
Rick -- I mean,that's just nasty.

395
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:50,000
You ready?

396
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,320
Okay,we're rolling.

397
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:07,170
Haley,did I do something to upset you?

398
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,520
You mean besides lying and cheating?

399
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:14,090
Excuse me?

400
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,630
You told me you weren't back for lucas.

401
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:17,960
I'm not.

402
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:19,370
That's the lying.

403
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,290
- Haley  
- you kissed him last night.

404
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,640
I saw you.

405
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,700
And that's the cheating.

406
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:27,850
And now I have to be the matron of honor to a really sweet girl whose fianc?

407
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:30,700
is hooking up with his old girlfriend behind her back.

408
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:33,380
So,yeah,I know we're friends,but,yeah,peyton,

409
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,950
you did something to upset me and that should upset you.

410
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,210
Okay,listen.

411
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:47,340
You said no,peyton,and lindsey said yes.

412
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,980
I said,someday.

413
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,660
Well,lucas fell in love in the meantime.

414
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,100
You've got to stop trying to take that away from him.

415
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,120
but that's the thing --

416
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:24,000
it's not what he says,it's the way he says it.

417
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:27,420
He honestly acts like he is above me,which is ridiculous.

418
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:30,270
He's a bartender.He mixes**

419
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,400
like chocolate milk?

420
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:34,590
Not exactly.

421
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,730
Are you gonna kill furry woodland creatures?

422
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:42,100
I most certainly am not gonna kill furry woodland creatures.

423
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:44,250
Promise?

424
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,980
Pinky swear,yeah.

425
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:48,450
Now,where was I?

426
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,390
He should be so lucky.

427
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,100
I am brooke davis.

428
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:54,170
Brooke penelope davis.

429
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,690
Exactly!

430
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,490
Besides,what has he ever even said to make me think he's worth my time?

431
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,980
What's underneath all the clothes,brooke davis?

432
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:06,370
How old are you again?

433
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,810
All right.

434
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,710
One more scoop for the boy genius,but don't tell your mom.

435
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,630
Come on.

436
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,240
You got to know it's on your sleeve this top is really cute.Big date?

437
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,170
Oh,just something to impress a guy.

438
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,760
Well,I hope this does the trick.

439
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,230
Fingers crossed.

440
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,630
Millicent,uh,you never called me back,so I thought I'd swing by.

441
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
Actually,I didn't call back on purpose.

442
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,890
Can I ask why?

443
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,230
I don't think we're a good match.

444
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,470
You like sports,and I like ballet,so there's that.

445
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,040
That's the worst reason I've ever heard.

446
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,410
Then how about you like having sex with your boss,and I like ballet?

447
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,410
Brooke told me.

448
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,550
Thank you,brooke davis.

449
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:55,120
Look,that's completely over with,as of last night.

450
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:58,170
Well,I'm glad to hear that,marvin,but it's not really the point.

451
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,110
I don't want to date the kind of guy who would sleep with his boss to get ahead at his job,

452
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,490
no matter how hot or funny or smart he is otherwise.

453
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,640
Millicent.

454
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,020
I'm very sorry,marvin,but.

455
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,910
you're just not the guy I had hoped you would be.

456
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,720
I'm marvin mcfadden,along by --

457
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,070
I'm marvin mcfadden,and with today is --

458
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,830
are you okay?

459
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,220
I'm sorry.

460
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,590
This is the biggest break of my life,

461
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,390
and I can't stop thinking about this girl I met.

462
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:41,800
She thinks I'm morally bankrupt,

463
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:44,380
and the truth is,I have been lately.

464
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,820
Come on,mouth.

465
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,810
You're the most stand-up guy I know.

466
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:50,990
All right,look,if it's true.

467
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:53,140
turn it around.

468
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,340
Thanks,lucas.

469
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,660
Where were we?

470
00:27:57,670 --> 00:28:00,160
Uh,you were asking me how we intend on,

471
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,750
um,avoiding getting our asses handed to us.

472
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,660
I'm here with coach lucas scott,

473
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:09,930
whose storied buzzer-beater sealed a championship for the tree hill ravens four years ago.

474
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,370
hi,mom.

475
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:20,740
So,is there any way that there's,like,

476
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,680
a cosmic loophole that could allow you to talk to me?

477
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:30,550
'Cause I could really use one of those mother/daughter talks all the other girls are raving about.

478
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:43,720
lucas has asked another girl to marry him.

479
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:51,250
I know,right,who does he think he is,asking some beautiful,brilliant,

480
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:56,880
successful editor over the unemployed girl who said someday?

481
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:03,320
What do I do now,mom?

482
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,780
Where do I go from here?

483
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,250
thanks,mom.

484
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,260
I fear Scott residence.

485
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,910
Hey,carrie.It's me.

486
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,720
Listen,I have been making some great progress with mia,

487
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,460
and I was hoping to put in a few more hours,

488
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,420
but I wasn't sure if jamie and nathan were waiting on me for dinner.

489
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,870
They're not home right now,but I'll handle dinner if they show up.

490
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,520
Really? That would be great.Thank you.

491
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:48,800
You're a lifesaver.

492
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:51,020
Just happy to help.

493
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,610
Boys,dinner's ready!

494
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:06,580
Let me see that.

495
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,470
Oh,it's genius.

496
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,880
It's a work of art.

497
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,880
A work of art.Look,mama.

498
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,130
Uh,I mean,nanny carrie.

499
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,760
I've been thinking about what you said earlier,and I get it.

500
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:33,400
I wouldn'twant to date you if you were sleeping with your boss,either.

501
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,110
Brooke?

502
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,370
Ct.Vioria.

503
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:40,850
I would totally date you if you were sleeping with brooke.

504
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,760
Millicent,wait,uh.

505
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:49,780
thm not at guy,at least that's not the guy I've been in the past.

506
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,530
Would you give me just one chance to prove that to you,please?

507
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,570
I promise,it's not a date.

508
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,780
Go home.

509
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,450
But first.

510
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,440
we toast your engagement.

511
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,280
You know,I'm nervous.

512
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:28,610
Oh,don't be nervous.

513
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,850
Them chumps at la salle,they won't even know what hit 'em.

514
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,180
Yeah,I'm not talking about the game.

515
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,530
I know.

516
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:40,360
Look,I was nervous my first time,too.

517
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,780
Just remember.

518
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:46,450
it's a beautiful expression of love between a man and a woman.

519
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,780
Very funny.

520
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,550
Luke,you're a man.

521
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,040
I'd be worried if you said you wasn't nervous.

522
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,630
here's to my friend lucas scott,

523
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:03,600
who don't need to be nervous because he always,

524
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,600
without fail,follows his heart.

525
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:10,550
Cheers.

526
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,080
All right,how about just one more?

527
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,430
Where are we?

528
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,900
I know it doesn't look like much,

529
00:32:29,910 --> 00:32:32,090
but this is my favorite room in the world.

530
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:36,940
With our satellite,I can find almost any sporting event anywhere,anytime.

531
00:32:36,950 --> 00:32:38,580
That's great,but why?

532
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,000
I mean,why sports?

533
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,670
I guess,when I watch a game,

534
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,760
it reminds me we all have greatness inside of us.

535
00:32:45,870 --> 00:32:49,190
You know,on any given day,an underdog can rise up.

536
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,630
It gives me hope.

537
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,620
Here we go.

538
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,290
What's this?

539
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,190
The moscow ballet.

540
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,880
I hear they're prety good.

541
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,170
I don't understand.

542
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,670
Well,I was hoping you would tell me why you love ballet,

543
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:13,260
'cause I think you're really great,

544
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,400
millicent,and I'd love to know more about you.

545
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,680
I'm sorry I called you mama.

546
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:24,350
It's okay.

547
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,350
You want to hear a secret?

548
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:35,440
Sometimes I pretend you're my kid.

549
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,010
you're so good with him.

550
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,910
No,he's good with me.

551
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,650
What?

552
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,680
What's so funny?

553
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,580
Nothing,just -- 

554
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,700
you've had paint on your face for the past two hours.

555
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:28,650
Why didn't you tell me? Where?

556
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,100
Here.

557
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,530
Wait a minute.

558
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,280
Close your eyes.

559
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,270
You actually managed to get paint on your eyelids.

560
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,520
Okay.

561
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,790
Hold on.I'll get it.

562
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,000
Nanny carrie!

563
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,280
Do you think maybe whitey will let you out of practice early so we can catch a movie?

564
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,490
What are you doing,peyton?

565
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:31,020
Just pretending for a second that we're still 17 and nothing's changed.

566
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:36,200
Would you believe I actually met a girl who lives vicariously through us,

567
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,760
at least the us in the book?

568
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,390
Sure,I do.

569
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,300
It was a great story to be a part of,but.

570
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,010
it also took place a long time ago.

571
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,630
I know.

572
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,420
I didn't come here to rehash the past.

573
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:01,160
I was reminded today in a roundabout way that

574
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,460
the most perfect act of love is sacrifice.

575
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,200
That's what keith did for karen.

576
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,730
burying his feelings for her for all those years so he could be a good friend.

577
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,540
I love you,lucas.

578
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,910
And I think I have since the first moment we locked eyes.

579
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,380
And it is gonna suck!

580
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:43,360
But if what you want is for me to let go.

581
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,170
then I'm gonna do it.

582
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,930
Oh,be happy,luke.

583
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,780
I want that with all my heart.

584
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:25,430
Dear molly,this is gonna sound a little strange,

585
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,000
but I'd like you to paint over my old closet door.

586
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:33,190
The thing is,there is never a time when you'll be more honest,

587
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,210
when your convictions will be stronger,

588
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:39,030
or when your motives will be more pure than they are right now.

589
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,640
which means you should chase whatever it is that excites you.

590
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:47,580
They have such perfect lines and grace and power.

591
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:51,560
If I closed my eyes,you could totally be talking about sports right now.

592
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,620
Maybe you should try it.

593
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,980
Ballet?

594
00:37:55,990 --> 00:37:57,650
Closing your eyes.

595
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:07,270
Be confident and take risks.

596
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:12,950
and paint over my words so you can start writing your own.

597
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,710
I assume you're not carjacking me.

598
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,780
You said you wanted to know what was under the clothes.

599
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,180
I was being existential.

600
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,900
I was being literal.

601
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,360
and serious.

602
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,750
You make two fantastic points.

603
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,500
I should be getting home.

604
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,400
What?

605
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,930
You're turning down naked me?

606
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:54,450
Nobody turns down naked me.

607
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,980
Relax.

608
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,550
It was a joke.

609
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,950
You win.

610
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,310
Really?

611
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,800
Absolutely.

612
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,740
Let's have sex,brooke davis.

613
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,430
Your place or mine?

614
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:07,740
As if.

615
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:19,240
you haven't earned that,bartender boy.

616
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:24,010
Sleep tight.

617
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,720
My story may have inspired you,

618
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,370
but I'm certain your story will inspire the next girl to live in our room.

619
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,560
Attagirl.

620
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:39,930
You're home late.

621
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,460
Yeah,sorry.

622
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,610
Mmm,mia's album is sounding awesome.

623
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:44,810
Great.

624
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:48,780
Just,uh,wish you were home more.

625
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,370
Thanks.Me,too.

626
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,840
God,it's been a long day.

627
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:00,640
I snapped at lucas,basically called peyton a whore.

628
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,070
I feel pretty lousy about it.

629
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,920
Are you gonna tell lindsey about the kiss?

630
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:07,260
I don't know.

631
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,990
I'm starting to think some things are better left secrets.

632
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,980
I'm going to bed now,okay?

633
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:15,900
Yeah,great.We're fine here.

634
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:18,160
Just let me know if you need me.

635
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:29,460
I want you to know you don't need somebody to write about 

636
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:32,200
you in order for yur life to mean something.

637
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,730
You can write about yourself.

638
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,500
Make your own destiny.

639
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:40,090
Then,years from now,

640
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,240
the next girl will keep what you write on that door 

641
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,120
long enough to remind you of how inspired your life is.

642
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:50,610
And you can tell that girl to paint over the door,

643
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:55,460
because you realize the words you wrote,the friends you had,

644
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:59,470
the urgency you felt will always be there underneath the paint.

645
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,940
Let's get married right away.

646
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,940
The love you professed will always be there,

647
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,610
the spark of something undeniable,

648
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:13,490
a seed of hope,the truth,for better or for worse,

649
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,370
burning fiercely,just below the surface.

650
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,840
Love,peyton.
