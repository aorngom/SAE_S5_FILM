<i>i was happy.</i>

35
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,470

36
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:40,650
"lucas scott, if you break that box spring,

37
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,740

* and love can hurt so badly *

45
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,810
* and stories end so sadly *

47
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,060

yeah,yeah,yeah,no,okay. um,you sure everything's okay?

183
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:57,360
yeah.

184
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,900
i'm just really happy for you.

185
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,410
i got to go.

186
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,260
hi. it's brooke.

187
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:30,690
i know this probably seems out of the blue,

188
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,190
but do you think you could meet me at my store?

189
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,150
i thought you were gonna come meet me.

190
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,120
i chickened out.

191
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,370
you're just gonna have to join the mile-high club

192
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:48,140
on your own.

193
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,950
i just kind of did.

194
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,060
i'm kidding, i'm kidding.

195
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,270
so,um...

196
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,740
when would you like to get married,peyton sawyer?

197
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,850
oh,i love that question.

198
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,870
um...i don't know.

199
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,620
why don't we find a place we both like,

200
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,110
and then we could pick a date?

201
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:06,970
okay.

202
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,210
well,until then,how do you feel about

203
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,100
living in********

204
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,390
moving in with me?

205
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,970
well,considering the last 48 hours,

206
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,810
<i>i'm pretty sure we already have been living in sin.</i>

207
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,860
yeah.

208
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,850
i'd love to.

209
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:28,590
i do want to spend one more night with brooke,though.

210
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:33,610
she sounded sad on the phone, and i'm gonna miss her.

211
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:37,930
you got it.

212
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,540
my god.

213
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,700
brooke?

214
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,650
hi.

215
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,770

216
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,600
yeah.

217
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,670
last night.

218
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,010
oh,my god.

219
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:15,830
i'm not gonna cry.

220
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,890
oh,it's okay.

221
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,070
i'm not gonna cry.

222
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,480
hey,baby. how was school?

223
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,470

229
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:14,410
my god,man.

00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,300
<i>you are getting it back.</i>

231
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,050
slowly but surely.

232
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,930
<i>slowly? dude, you're playing like me.</i>

233
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,890

245
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,960
yeah,i see. i like that,man.

246
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:53,960
i wish i had me one of them.

247
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:55,830
that's hot.

248
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:57,010
wait a second.

249
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,330
i brought you something,man. i got you a little something.

250
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,000
hold on one second.

251
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,450
hey.

252
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,800
dan was at school again today.

253
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,600
it just bothers me that he keeps coming around.

254
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,710
quentin: check this out.

255
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,420
now,when i was a kid,

256
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:20,980
i used to put all my little treasures in here.

257
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,120
see that? hmm?

258
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,550
<i>now you can,too.</i>

259
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,100
cool! thanks,q!

260
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,930
oh,man,it was nothing. you got it.

261
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,710
q,i'm gonna be in my classroom.

262
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,710
all right,i'll be right there, miss h.j.s.

263
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,300
all right,baller, i got to go,man,

264
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:35,950
but,uh...

265
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:37,980
see if you can beat your dad in that cape.

266
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:40,600
oh,yeah,it's easy. it's nothing.

267
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:42,710
you can do it.

268
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:44,610
it's a pretty cool gift, huh?

269
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,250
let's see what you got, dr. j.

270
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:55,770
yes!

271
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,500
nothing but net.

272
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,940
did you call the police?

273
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,480
no, and i don't want to.

274
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,380
brooke,you have to file a police report,

275
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,180
or your insurance company won't accept the claim.

276
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,090
i don't want to. i have plenty of money for this.

277
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,200
well,do you know what's missing?

278
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,120
the computer, cash from the register,

279
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,710
and the sketches for my new line.

280
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:27,990
oh,honey. i'm so sorry.

281
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:31,230
but i really think we need to call the police.

282
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,040
no. i don't want the press involved in this.

283
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,450
so you can't tell anyone,okay?

284
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,920
<i>not haley and nathan or peyton or anyone.</i>

285
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:42,790
please.

286
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:45,520
okay.

287
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,650
thank you.

288
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,550
come here.

289
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:55,240
deb,you own a gun, right?

290
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:00,660
i do.

291
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,970
i want you to teach me how to use it.

292
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:17,520
jamie was happy to see you at school today.

293
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,360
haley didn't look very pleased,though.

294
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,430
pretty soon, when jamie goes missing,

295
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,350
she'll remember that grandpa dan kept coming around.

296
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,690
as a matter of fact,

297
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,710
she saw his car there practically every day.

298
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:41,730
how does it feel to be the prime suspect,huh?

299
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,200
what's on your mind, skills?

300
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,060
oh,nothing.

301
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:02,300
actually,when you first started dating haley,

302
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,390
how hard was that for you to keep that from lucas?

303
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,020
d.

304
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,710
it was probably harder for haley 'cause they were friends,

305
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,670
but i didn't like lucas.

306
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,720
you didn't like uncle lucas?

307
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,230
it was a long time ago, big ears.

308
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,870
why? where's your head?

309
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:22,890
just thinking about the rules of it all,you know --

310
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,110
how sometimes the heart just wants what it wants.

311
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,040
so,what's going on, skills?

312
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:31,160
you sneaking around with some hot girl and not telling us?

313
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,980
yeah,what's going on, sk-i-ills?

314
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,440
hey.

315
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,700
my ears aren't that big.

316
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:47,480
* is there anybody in there? *

317
00:16:47,850 --> 00:16:50,310
well,mr. fields,you've certainly come a long way.

318
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,150
it almost seems as though

319
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,250
you're starting to enjoy "les miséRables."

320
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,090
oh,come on,now. don't get crazy on me.

321
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:58,290
you asked me to read the book, and i'm reading the book.

322
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:01,660
i've also noticed how you are with jamie and nathan.

323
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:03,210
i appreciate it.

324
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:04,510
i'm telling you,man.

325
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:06,720
jamie -- that kid right there -- he is gonna be the man.

326
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:10,220
i'm serious. he already got some things going for him.

327
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,580
well, i think he likes it

328
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:13,780
thathe star of the basketball team makes him feel special.

329
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,010
well,i got a little brother his age.

330
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:23,150
yeah,he always watching me and copying me and whatever.

331
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:24,160
i ju -- i don't know.

332
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,440
i just try to keep it fun for him

333
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,210
before he grows up and life gets harder.

334
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,650
quentin,what do you want to do with your life?

335
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,340
besides basketball.

336
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,400
besides basketball...

337
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,420
i don't know -- i guess,uh...

338
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,200
get married, raise a family.

339
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,210
yeah? you want kids?

340
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,740
i mean, i think about it sometimes.

341
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:55,640
when i look at my little brother or when i see j luke,

342
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,130
i don't know.

343
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,540
i think maybe i'll have a son of my own someday

344
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,990
or,you know, a little girl.

345
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,590
that'd be all right.

346
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:06,290
yeah.

347
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,290
well,like i said,you've certainly come a long way.

348
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,160
a-plus,mr. fields.

349
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,610
a-plus?

350
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,010
a-plus.

351
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:23,640
what? i got a --

352
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,150
nice.

353
00:18:25,810 --> 00:18:28,030
so,i guess this means i get to go ahead and stop reading this book?

354
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,550
no.

355
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,260
i -- not even -- i can't...

356
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:39,710
okay,that's good. just a little lower now.

357
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:40,550
okay.

358
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,640
ahh. perfect.

359
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:44,320
hi.

360
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,300
hi,mama. what is this?

361
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:47,340
i won't let you hop on the bed,)?

362
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,480
so you're hopping on the pop?

363
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,080
it's fun. you should try it.

364
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:51,880
maybe i will.

365
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:57,850
hey,um,where's deb?

366
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,600
i have no idea -- again.

367
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,950
hi. hey.

368
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,130
um,i-i don't have very long.

369
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,660
oh,okay. good.

370
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:16,790
sorry.

371
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,200
how was your day?

372
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,410
i had to lie to jamie about us.

373
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,660
then...something else happened.

374
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,040
wait. come on.

375
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:27,890
sit down.

376
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,570
what's going on?

377
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,790
well,i-i can't really talk about it,

378
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,930
but,um... i have a friend

379
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:39,250
who's going through some really emotional stuff.

380
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:42,580
and she wants me to keep it a secret.

381
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,270
okay.

382
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,120
i'm just not sure i should.

383
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,150
well,how'd you find out about it?

384
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,050
she called me.

385
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,780
well,without knowing the situation,

386
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,350
i'd say that she called you for a reason.

387
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,240
and if she ain't really tell nobody else about it,

388
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,940
then that means that she respects you

389
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,880
and probably thinks that you're the one person

390
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:05,980
that just might understand what she going through.

391
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,270
yeah.

392
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,200
that makes a lot of sense.

393
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,230
i mean,is there anything i can do?

394
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,080
you just did it.

395
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,120
hey.

396
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:23,870
we just had our first real conversation.

397
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:25,900
it was nice.

398
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,180
<i>yeah,it was kind of nice,huh?</i>

399
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,650
i mean,it wasn't better than that cheerleading outfit,but...

400
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:35,080
it was nice.

401
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
brooke, i'm home!

402
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,816
brke: okay,
don't freak out.

403
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,699
why?

404
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,766
oh, my god.

405
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,400
brooke, what happened?

406
00:20:58,717 --> 00:21:02,083
lindsey came by
and said, "peyton's a bitch."

407
00:21:02,149 --> 00:21:04,348
<i>and i said,
"peyton is not a bitch."</i>

408
00:21:04,349 --> 00:21:05,883
and she said,
"yes, she is."

409
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,217
<i>and i said, "well, maybe
you're the bitch, bitch."</i>

410
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:10,416
and...

411
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:15,332
but you should see
her face.

412
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,999
brooke...

413
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,515
i was doing laundry,

414
00:21:20,516 --> 00:21:22,849
and i got all tangled up
in one of the sheets,

415
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:27,083
and i fell face-first
down the stairs.

416
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,217
oh, honey.

417
00:21:28,282 --> 00:21:30,050
i'm sorry i wasn't here.

418
00:21:30,117 --> 00:21:31,883
why didn't you call me?

419
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:37,066
<i>i did, but you said
you were getting married.</i>

420
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,699
is that why you sounded
so bad on the phone?

421
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:42,933
oh, i'm so sorry.

422
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,633
no, it's okay.

423
00:21:44,699 --> 00:21:46,599
really,
i'm too sore to hug.

424
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:47,599
okay.

425
00:21:47,666 --> 00:21:49,933
but congratulations.

426
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:51,350
thanks.

427
00:21:51,467 --> 00:21:53,267
it's kind of sudden,
right?

428
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,333
are you kidding?

429
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,299
the rest of the world's
been waiting on you two idiots

430
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,567
since high school.

431
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,482
he asked me
to move in with him.

432
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,616
really?

433
00:22:04,683 --> 00:22:06,683
do married people do that?

434
00:22:12,949 --> 00:22:15,483
i really am happy for you,
p. sawyer.

435
00:22:16,817 --> 00:22:18,316
i might be
a little happier

436
00:22:18,383 --> 00:22:20,715
<i>if it was your bony ass
that fell down the stairs,</i>

437
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,417
but still...

438
00:22:22,782 --> 00:22:25,250
i'm gonna miss this.

439
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:27,416
me too.

440
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:46,341
* i smell a little monster
sneaking up behind me *

441
00:22:50,075 --> 00:22:51,807
what's up, beastie boy?

442
00:22:51,958 --> 00:22:53,125
can you help me
make a cape?

443
00:22:54,141 --> 00:22:55,641
sure. how come?

444
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,707
well, quentin
really likes mine,

445
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:01,108
and i thought maybe we could
make one for him, too.

446
00:23:01,675 --> 00:23:04,007
i think
that's a very nice idea.

447
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,975
i'd be happy
to help you, sir.

448
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:09,141
do you smell that?

449
00:23:10,075 --> 00:23:11,023
no.

450
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:13,174
i-i smell
a bigger monster.

451
00:23:13,791 --> 00:23:15,975
uncle lucas!

452
00:23:17,441 --> 00:23:18,673
you're gettingting heavy.

453
00:23:19,324 --> 00:23:21,507
did you know that
daddy didn't like you once?

454
00:23:22,024 --> 00:23:22,840
what?

455
00:23:22,941 --> 00:23:23,874
when?

456
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:25,924
when he was dating mama.

457
00:23:25,925 --> 00:23:27,524
i have big ears.

458
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,375
good looking out.

459
00:23:31,708 --> 00:23:34,241
kid's got my back.

460
00:23:35,241 --> 00:23:37,574
so, speaking of
sneaking around,

461
00:23:38,301 --> 00:23:40,268
uh, where have you been
the last few days?

462
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:43,725
with peyton, maybe?

463
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,300
actually, we're engaged.

464
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,399
get out!

465
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:51,699
dude, i just
shaved your head

466
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,433
from your last engagement
gone wrong!

467
00:23:53,825 --> 00:23:56,491
i know.
i know it sounds crazy.

468
00:23:56,808 --> 00:23:59,290
but we just spent the last
couple of days together,

469
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:01,725
happier than either one of us
can remember.

470
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:04,699
and i know i have been
all over the place.

471
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,133
but my best friend told me,
"pick a team."

472
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:10,275
and you were right.

473
00:24:12,208 --> 00:24:13,908
you're happy?

474
00:24:14,075 --> 00:24:15,975
<i>we both are.</i>

475
00:24:16,041 --> 00:24:18,442
that's all that counts.

476
00:24:18,507 --> 00:24:20,957
besides, the only people
that tear happy people down

477
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:24,157
are those that are unhappy,
so you go do your thing.

478
00:24:24,158 --> 00:24:25,158
i got your back.

479
00:24:27,025 --> 00:24:28,291
thanks.

480
00:24:28,757 --> 00:24:30,874
thank you.

481
00:24:33,808 --> 00:24:35,408
for what?

482
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,674
for always helping me,

483
00:24:37,741 --> 00:24:42,175
for giving me a place to live
and for the record label

484
00:24:42,241 --> 00:24:46,342
and...for being
my best friend.

485
00:24:46,908 --> 00:24:49,840
you really are a good person,
brooke davis.

486
00:24:49,841 --> 00:24:52,075
<i>and what do i
get out of it?</i>

487
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,573
great friends...

488
00:24:54,574 --> 00:24:56,440
great life...

489
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:58,142
good karma.

490
00:24:58,808 --> 00:25:02,274
i don't believe in karma.

491
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:06,208
i try to be a good person,
and bad stuff happens anyway.

492
00:25:06,275 --> 00:25:08,975
like what kind
of bad stuff?

493
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,041
like falling
down the stairs?

494
00:25:12,608 --> 00:25:14,674
yeah,
something like that.

495
00:25:16,308 --> 00:25:18,774
you missing angie?

496
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:22,008
i don't really want
to talk about it.

497
00:25:22,075 --> 00:25:24,041
okay.

498
00:25:26,341 --> 00:25:29,308
ll, let me
ask you something.

499
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:32,341
if you don't
believe in karma...

500
00:25:32,408 --> 00:25:33,874
what do you believe in?

501
00:25:35,041 --> 00:25:36,908
justice.

502
00:25:37,414 --> 00:25:41,515
* I'm not sure i'll see you again *

503
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,333
make sure
we make it bigger, mama.

504
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,367
q's a li-i-ttle bigger
than me.

505
00:25:45,434 --> 00:25:46,434
a little?

506
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:49,634
you think
nanny deb wants help?

507
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,400
oh, i think nanny deb's
taking a nap right now.

508
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:56,033
she sure has been tired
a lot lately.

509
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,200
yeah, she has, huh?

510
00:26:00,066 --> 00:26:02,233
where did i put
my scissors?

511
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:09,781
*i'm trying to change your dream*

512
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:14,014
*and don't you see me?*

513
00:26:14,081 --> 00:26:16,948
*would you come back?*

514
00:26:17,014 --> 00:26:19,781
*would you take this chance?*

515
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:25,500
hey. masked avenger,

516
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:26,599
what?

517
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,833
i know
what you've been up to.

518
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:31,200
i was gonna tell you.

519
00:26:31,267 --> 00:26:33,933
deb, i will not have a junkie
around my son.

520
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,766
oh, wait. what?

521
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,734
i found the pills.

522
00:26:39,801 --> 00:26:40,666
o...kay.

523
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:42,065
come on, deb.

524
00:26:42,066 --> 00:26:43,734
nathan's pain medication
for his back.

525
00:26:43,801 --> 00:26:45,200
this bottle was full
a week ago,

526
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,534
and now you're out all night
and you're always tired.

527
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:50,666
you think
i took those pills?

528
00:26:50,867 --> 00:26:52,000
well, unless you've been
fighting crime in that thing,

529
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:53,233
where the hell
have you been?

530
00:26:55,534 --> 00:26:56,801
i've been having sex.

531
00:26:58,633 --> 00:26:59,299
well, i have.

532
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,283
and i haven't taken
a single one of those pills.

533
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,999
<i>i believe
your husband's back</i>

534
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,834
has been bothering him
lately.

535
00:27:10,266 --> 00:27:11,750
we know what
you've been up to, nathan.

536
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,799
and don't
try and blame it on deb,

537
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,117
because she has been
having sex.

538
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,700
ugh.

539
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:20,700
have you been taking
these pills?

540
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:21,833
and don't say...
yes.

541
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,267
yes. yes?

542
00:27:23,334 --> 00:27:24,099
yeah.

543
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,234
those are my pain pills
for my back,

544
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,934
and my back's
been in pain.

545
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,100
this bottle was full
a week ago.

546
00:27:30,167 --> 00:27:31,167
i know.

547
00:27:31,334 --> 00:27:32,601
i've been taking
two a day,

548
00:27:32,667 --> 00:27:34,400
which is
what the prescription says.

549
00:27:34,467 --> 00:27:36,233
but --
you know,
contrary to popular belief,

550
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:39,300
<i>some people can take pills
without turning into a junkie.</i>

551
00:27:42,701 --> 00:27:44,634
i'm going back to bed.

552
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,933
look, if it makes you
feel any better,

553
00:27:50,934 --> 00:27:52,634
i could probably play
through the pain,

554
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:54,334
but those pills
really seem to help.

555
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,367
i just want you
to be careful.

556
00:27:57,234 --> 00:27:59,234
i will.

557
00:27:59,251 --> 00:28:00,684
are you okay?

558
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,216
yeah.

559
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:04,384
yeah. sorry.

560
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:07,217
can we at least
just go see the doctor

561
00:28:07,284 --> 00:28:09,284
and talk to him
about everything

562
00:28:09,351 --> 00:28:11,150
now that
you're playing again?

563
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:14,518
sure.
we'll go tomorrow.

564
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:16,284
okay.

565
00:28:19,951 --> 00:28:22,950
you know what the worst part
about being a fugitive is?

566
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,483
being a fugitive.

567
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:28,350
all that sneaking around,
constantly being pursued.

568
00:28:28,717 --> 00:28:30,666
<i>see, that's where
you come in.</i>

569
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,334
grandpa dan,
just out of prison,

570
00:28:32,401 --> 00:28:33,868
hanging around
the schoolyard,

571
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:38,000
and then jamie's missing
and grandpa dan's missing.

572
00:28:39,234 --> 00:28:41,167
i'm sure the manhunt
will be extensive,

573
00:28:41,234 --> 00:28:44,200
but they'll be looking for you
in a black s.u.v.,

574
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:46,900
not in a shallow grave
out by the swing set.

575
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:56,300
you know
what i love most?

576
00:28:56,301 --> 00:28:58,433
the fact that
no one checks up on you

577
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:00,067
<i>because no one likes you.</i>

578
00:29:00,134 --> 00:29:03,951
<i>yeah, they'll all miss jamie,
but no one's gonna miss you.</i>

579
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:07,599
all i have to do is
burn your i.d. and that pager.

580
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,882
and, by the way,
a beeper --

581
00:29:08,883 --> 00:29:10,883
what are you, a drug dealer
on "miami vice"?

582
00:29:15,551 --> 00:29:17,351
<i>you did get one page,
though --</i>

583
00:29:17,517 --> 00:29:20,484
right after i hit you
with that car.

584
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:23,801
so i guess your table's ready
at the cheesecake factory.)y

585
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,117
it's alive!

586
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:37,167
well done.

587
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:42,101
<i>what does it want to say?</i>

588
00:29:45,834 --> 00:29:47,633
your plan sucks.

589
00:29:58,113 --> 00:29:59,497
you know, that pain
you're experiencing

590
00:29:59,647 --> 00:30:01,247
is your body
telling you to slow down.

591
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:04,780
you can't handle the pace
you kept before your accident.

592
00:30:04,847 --> 00:30:07,613
which is not to say you can't
have a basketball career again,

593
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,047
if you're smart about it.

594
00:30:09,164 --> 00:30:10,997
what does that mean,
exactly?

595
00:30:11,064 --> 00:30:13,431
can you tell us the risks to him
if he plays again?

596
00:30:13,498 --> 00:30:16,063
well, it's the "exactly" part
that's a little tricky, haley.

597
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,463
nathan's back
is held together

598
00:30:17,464 --> 00:30:19,930
with medical ingenuity
and a few miracles.

599
00:30:19,931 --> 00:30:22,314
<i>the miracle part
isn't exactly scientific.</i>

600
00:30:22,481 --> 00:30:24,963
but it's possible that
i could play for 10 years
and be fine, right?

601
00:30:25,464 --> 00:30:26,430
oh, yeah, it's possible.

602
00:30:27,097 --> 00:30:28,700
but here's
the worst-case scenario.

603
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,600
you cause your spine
enough trauma

604
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:33,697
to end up back in that
wheelchair -- possibly for life.

605
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:39,897
* how many times... *

606
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,966
how come
peyton's moving out?

607
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:45,233
<i>because she's moving in
with me.</i>

608
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,866
we're getting married.

609
00:30:46,933 --> 00:30:48,933
what happened
to lindsey?

610
00:30:49,883 --> 00:30:51,816
it's a long story, kid.

611
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,800
were you ever in love
with mama?

612
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:58,867
<i>what do you mean?
like love love?</i>

613
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,199
no, we were always, uh,
just friends.

614
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,167
why?

615
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,400
just wondered.

616
00:31:06,467 --> 00:31:08,667
were you ever in love
with aunt brooke?

617
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,000
long story.

618
00:31:14,133 --> 00:31:15,567
here.

619
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,966
make yourself useful,
knucklehead.

620
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,100
when you get married,

621
00:31:22,101 --> 00:31:24,535
do i have to be
the ring bearer again?

622
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:27,333
not if you don't want to.

623
00:31:27,334 --> 00:31:31,867
good. 'cause last time,
it didn't work out so well.

624
00:31:31,867 --> 00:31:35,034
* left al

625
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:39,568
your plan sucks.

626
00:31:40,034 --> 00:31:41,233
really?

627
00:31:41,234 --> 00:31:44,001
the guy can finally speak, and
he's a frickin' talking parrot.

628
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,635
don't make me
get the ball gag.

629
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,151
now you're just
turning me on.

630
00:31:51,084 --> 00:31:52,151
okay.

631
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,665
i'll play your little game,
parrot.

632
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,966
why does my plan suck?

633
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,766
the pager.

634
00:32:00,767 --> 00:32:03,632
there's a number
on the back of it.

635
00:32:03,633 --> 00:32:04,800
call it.

636
00:32:10,034 --> 00:32:12,166
is this a trick?

637
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:15,566
call it and find out.

638
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:25,234
my plan doesn't suck.

639
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:31,632
they're getting married,
huh?

640
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:33,133
yeah.

641
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:39,999
the doctor scared you,
didn't he?

642
00:32:40,866 --> 00:32:43,299
right about the time
he said "paralysis."

643
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:47,334
* frame ghost,
left perfume on pillow *

644
00:32:47,399 --> 00:32:49,366
* room without a halo *

645
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:53,600
i was watching you practice
with the team yesterday.

646
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:55,600
you looked so happy --

647
00:32:55,666 --> 00:32:59,033
somebody that was doing exactly
what they were born to do.

648
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,349
you still love it,
don't you?

649
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,350
yeah. i do.

650
00:33:04,117 --> 00:33:06,382
and the truth is,
i could probably slow down

651
00:33:06,383 --> 00:33:07,715
and try to play
a little differently.

652
00:33:07,716 --> 00:33:09,616
no, you can't.
that's not who you are.

653
00:33:09,683 --> 00:33:12,317
you can't do that.

654
00:33:12,383 --> 00:33:14,082
can i tell you
a secret, though?

655
00:33:14,083 --> 00:33:15,783
that's what i love
about you.

656
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,932
i remember the first time
i saw you play

657
00:33:17,933 --> 00:33:19,334
when i was tutoring you.

658
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:21,334
you were like a rock star
out there.

659
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,733
masonboro.

660
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,700
you sat with keith,
and you wore that goofy hat.

661
00:33:25,766 --> 00:33:27,700
whatever.

662
00:33:27,766 --> 00:33:29,833
i scored 35 points
that night,

663
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,933
and each basket
was like my own personal version

664
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,400
of a haley james
pickup line.

665
00:33:35,716 --> 00:33:37,983
it worked.

666
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:42,965
i played that game for you,
haley, and you know what?

667
00:33:42,966 --> 00:33:44,900
i'd give it up
for you, too.

668
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,099
'cause as much as i love
playing the game

669
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:51,866
and the person that i am
when i play it,

670
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:54,367
i love being a husband
and a father more.

671
00:33:55,295 --> 00:34:00,728
*i don't fear anything in this place we're in*

672
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,717
this is
the last of it.

673
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:05,899
no brooke?

674
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,234
no.

675
00:34:07,301 --> 00:34:08,949
she was gone
when i woke up this morning,

676
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:11,084
and she's not picking up
her cell or at the store.

677
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,867
that sucks.
i really wanted to see her.

678
00:34:13,883 --> 00:34:14,950
a little help here.

679
00:34:15,016 --> 00:34:16,916
whoa. i got you.

680
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:21,032
hey, peyton.

681
00:34:21,133 --> 00:34:23,367
it's a beginning,
not an end.

682
00:34:23,433 --> 00:34:28,300
* all that i am made of *

683
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:34,117
* and all that i have *

684
00:34:34,184 --> 00:34:39,683
* when you are near me *

685
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,184
* when you are here *

686
00:34:43,251 --> 00:34:49,316
* i see that all that i am *

687
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:59,484
* you're all that i am *

688
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,882
stop smiling!

689
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:13,599
call the number.

690
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,199
aagh! "call the number,
call the number"!

691
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,900
you want me to call the number?
i'll call the damn number!

692
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,099
pay as you go.
no caller i.d.

693
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,166
my "plan sucks," says
the cripple in the restraints.

694
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,566
emergency
medical response team.

695
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:35,350
may i have your name and the
number on your pager, please?

696
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,866
i-i'm sorry. i think
i've dialed the wrong number.

697
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,000
who is this?

698
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:40,733
emergency
medical response team.

699
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,582
and unless you're on the waiting
list for a heart transplant,

700
00:35:43,583 --> 00:35:45,150
you've called
the wrong number.

701
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,267
i'm sorry.

702
00:35:48,866 --> 00:35:50,665
shut up.

703
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,434
i said, "shut up!"

704
00:36:05,434 --> 00:36:08,450
brooke?
it's deb, honey.

705
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:11,766
brooke?

706
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,434
hi.

707
00:36:27,501 --> 00:36:29,099
i was
in the neighborhood.

708
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,833
thought you might want to have
a little girls' night.

709
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,949
no, thank you.

710
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:35,617
brooke...

711
00:36:35,683 --> 00:36:39,999
i lived a lot of years
feeling powerless and alone.

712
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,033
i was pissed off and medicated
and scared to death.

713
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:46,301
that's not going to happen
to you -- not if i can help it.

714
00:36:48,783 --> 00:36:50,450
now, get dressed.

715
00:36:50,517 --> 00:36:52,767
what does that mean --
emergency response team?

716
00:36:52,784 --> 00:36:54,550

and even if i kidnap
my own grandson,

720
00:37:04,516 --> 00:37:09,049

for a few months.
