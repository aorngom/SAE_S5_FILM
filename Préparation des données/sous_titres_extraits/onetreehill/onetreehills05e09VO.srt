1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,720
Previously on "one tree hill"...

2
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,470
I still love you, lucas.

3
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:05,210
Peyton, I...

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:13,100
lucas asked me to marry him.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,990
What the hell is this?

6
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,460
Well, we have this website.

7
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,480
Yeah, we're sports announcers.

8
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:23,730
Everyone get away from the door!

9
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,140
Jim, you can't do this.

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,470
It's a little late for that, mouth.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:29,590
You're bleeding. We got
to get you somewhere safe.

12
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,900
No, I can't! I can't walk. I tried.

13
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,480
Jimmy, please-- please.

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,100
i'm sorry

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,110
No!

16
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:40,150
He was my friend.

17
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,540
I, uh...I miss him a lot.

18
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,140
lucas,  look me in the eye

19
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,730
and tell me that that kiss did not feel
exactly the same as it felt three years ago.

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,660
I'm in love with her, peyton.

24
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:20,250
Take a look at this picture.

25
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:22,130
What do you see?

26
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,620
There's a high school basketball
game tonight somewhere in america, 

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,150
and there's a great story there.

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,390
sometimes, to find it, you
have to look away...

29
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:44,600
into the shadows, on the
fringe of the obvious.

30
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,890
can you see it?

31
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,530
Look closer.

32
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,150
cut! Cut!

33
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,160
Great. Really great work, mia. Excellent.

34
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,570
Thank you guys very much.

35
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,650
We can check that and move on.

36
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,490
- Hey!
- Hey.

37
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,520
How crazy is this? It looks
just like your classroom.

38
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,910
It's so crazy.

39
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,660
All right, it's good. Let's move on.

40
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,600
Thank you.

41
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:27,760
Um, I kind of need to get out of here.

42
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,670
I don't know if you guys
need me for closeups...

43
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,760
no, no, no. You're good.

44
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:32,680
Okay. All right, see you.

45
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,120
Oh, haley.

46
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,850
Okay, about the whole lucas
engagement thing -- I just...

47
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,470
you got to let him go, peyton.

48
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,830
I know.

49
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:45,000
It's just hard.

50
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,940
It'll be okay.

51
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,050
I'll see you at the game.

52
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,910
This is so awesome.

53
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,360
What's next?

54
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,360
We go hand-held.

55
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,650
Local boys make good.

56
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,890
A new era dawns.

57
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,060
Come on, find the story.

58
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,710
Tonight's the big night, baby.

59
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,640
First game of the season and
broadcasting debut for marvin mcfadden.

60
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,800
It's just a taped segment.

61
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
I'm not even sure they're gonna run it.

62
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,560
Man, they gonna run it.

63
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,690
Look, you gonna throw down so
hard, they gonna have to run it.

64
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,140
Got an angle, right?

65
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,370
Yeah, I'm thinking, "former
state champions take over."

66
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,670
Something like that.

67
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,330
Yeah, that's all good.

68
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,590
Well, look, if you need
anything, I got you.

69
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,120
All-access, baby.

70
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,450
Hey, mouth.

71
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,590
Relax, dog.

72
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,640
You gonna do great, all right?

73
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,720
Hey, sorry. I'll just be one more minute.

74
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,060
I've never seen jamie so keyed up.

75
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,750
He's so excited about this game.

76
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,930
Everything all right?

77
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,680
I have to tell you something.

78
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,430
It's about carrie.

79
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:12,380
I should probably be
the one to tell her.

80
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:15,680
I have to give my two weeks notice.

81
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,590
Wh-wh-why?

82
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:21,590
Because I got accepted to a graduate
program that I thought I couldn't afford, 

83
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:27,160
but I got a last-minute scholarship
offer, and I think I have to take it.

84
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,170
Well, of course you do.

85
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:30,280
Congratulations.

86
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,000
We're gonna miss you.

87
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,890
I hope jamie doesn't take it too hard.

88
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,150
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.

89
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,650
More than you know.

90
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,340
Hey, luke.

91
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,410
You, uh, working on the game plan?

92
00:04:48,450 --> 00:04:53,700
Actually, uh...I was just
thinking about keith.

93
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,340
Wishing he were here, you know?

94
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:00,170
I've been thinking about jimmy all week.

95
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,440
What I wouldn't give to
trade this day for that one.

96
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,800
I see they took dan's
jersey down in the gym.

97
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,260
I'm glad.

98
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,220
Jimmy'd be proud of you.

99
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,500
Thanks.

100
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,270
You too.

101
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,300
Good luck, luke.

102
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,310
Thanks, mouth. You too.

103
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,300
Oh, keith, please help me out tonight.

104
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,530
what you think, ball?

105
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,540
It's good?

106
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,990
Yeah, good.

107
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:29,030
Hey, peyton, is that
really who you used to be?

108
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,030
Yep, that's me. Come on.

109
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,880
You were really cool. What happened?

110
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,380
Watch it.

111
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,040
So, tell me again -- we're going to see
the team that your ex-boyfriend coaches, 

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,600
but now he's engaged
to haley's friend, right?

113
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,160
Okay.

114
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:43,000
You want to see where I
went to high school or not?

115
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,800
No, totally. I just want to know
who we hate before we get there.

116
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,310
You see the girl showing off her cheap-ass
engagement ring to my best friend?

117
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,540
Yeah. Lindsey, right?

118
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:59,710
That's who we hate.

119
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,900
She knows exactly what she's doing.

120
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,400
I cannot believe that lindsey
invited brooke to the game.

121
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,830
I mean, it's bad enough she's got lucas, 

122
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,100
but now she's got to
snake in on my friends, too?

123
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,440
I once put a hex on a girl I
hated, and it totally worked.

124
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:18,550
Really? Maybe you could give her a
horrible rash or something for the wedding.

125
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:19,600
Totally.

126
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:22,950
So are we gonna go back or what? I
mean, I'm pretty excited about this catfight.

127
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,650
Okay, do you want to see the place where I
got shot and almost bled to death or what?

128
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,390
The catfight can wait.

129
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,340
- Hey, we saved you a seat.
- Thank you so much!

130
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:35,390
Oh, I can't wait to get
a good shot of jamie...

131
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,100
with my camera that I don't have.

132
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,250
It's in my classroom.

133
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,830
Can we go with you?

134
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,660
I'm dying to see
teacher girl's classroom.

135
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,030
All right. Come on.

136
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:55,640
All right, let's go. Listen up.

137
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,140
Four years ago, we won
a state championship.

138
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,830
And since then, there's
been a lot of losing.

139
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,800
But this is a new team, and
this is your house.

140
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,470
Good teams win at home.

141
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:11,340
Every game.

142
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,150
Every game.

143
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,520
And this is a good team.

144
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,380
Believe in that.

145
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:20,640
Believe in each other.

146
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,180
It all starts tonight, boys.

147
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,790
A new team da erves new look.

148
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,700
You should win half of your games
just for looking so damn good.

149
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,770
Jamie scott!

150
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,380
You better suit up, too, son.

151
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:49,500
Look at that!

152
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,080
If q's hand isn't
right, we might need you.

153
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,630
Go, jamie!

154
00:08:56,650 --> 00:09:02,490
Go, jamie!

155
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,300
This is so weird.

156
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,520
I feel like I haven't walked
these halls in 20 years.

157
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,360
Hey.

158
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:36,510
Isn't that mia?

159
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,700
Mia?

160
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,820
What are you doing here?

161
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,980
- Hey, peyton.
- Hey, check it out.

162
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:58,320
It's my old friends, brooke and
haley, and their new pal, lindsey.

163
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,470
Peyton, we made plans
for tonight before you --

164
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,240
before you called me a bitch.

165
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,410
Bitch? No. No, I did
not call you a bitch.

166
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,750
I said I didn't like you.

167
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,380
Peyton, um--

168
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,380
no, you don't have to make apologies
to her, just like I'm not apologizing

169
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:16,100
because I'm engaged
to lucas and she's not.

170
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,890
You know, I really was
gonna try to be nice to you, 

171
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,900
but I think that's officially over.

172
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,170
Works for me.

173
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,840
Great.

174
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,010
I'm gonna head back.

175
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,020
Hey!

176
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,210
If you get tired dragging
that fat ass back to the gym, 

177
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,030
there is a water fountain down the hall.

178
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,940
Whatever, you bulimic bitch.

179
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,870
I can'T. There's no handle.

180
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
They're fixing them over the weekend.

181
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,230
So what's that mean?

182
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:49,080
I think it means we're stuck.

183
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,610
Help!

184
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,080
Help!

185
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,690
Somebody!

186
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,710
Help us!

187
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,350
Somebody!

188
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,420
Somebody, please!

189
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,120
Somebody get us out of here!

190
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,870
Help!

191
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:20,270
Lindsey, lindsey, nobody's gonna hear you.

192
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,770
They're all at the game.

193
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:22,990
We cannot be locked in here.

194
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,780
I am totally claustrophobic.

195
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,980
But it's, like, a huge library.

196
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,240
It's the "locked in" part.

197
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,180
Relax. You'll be okay.

198
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:33,300
Okay, they're fixing all the other doors.

199
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,580
No handles.

200
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,410
And the phones seem to be out.

201
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,770
All the calls will go through
the office. Nobody's answering.

202
00:11:38,810 --> 00:11:40,360
Does anybody have cellphone reception?

203
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,560
'Cause I got nothing.

204
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,090
I don'T.

205
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:47,250
Nobody ever gets cellphone
reception in here.

206
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:50,250
Except for me, 'cause the world loves me!

207
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:53,700
I'm gonna call mouth. I'll have
us out of here in two seconds.

208
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,850
hey, this is mouth.
Please leave me a message.

209
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:08,050
It went to voice mail.

210
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,970
Well, there's got to be somebody
else we can call to get out of here.

211
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,750
Uh, call the police. 911.

212
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:16,110
There's someone out there getting
murdered, and we're gonna bother the police? No.

213
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,920
There is somebody that we know who's
not coaching or playing in this game.

214
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,320
Don't ask me. I just moved here.

215
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,650
Brooke.

216
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,150
I don't want to.

217
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:28,270
- Brooke.
- I don't even know his number.

218
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,740
What are you talking about?

219
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,640
Brooke's gonna call owen, her new
bartender crush, to get us out.

220
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:34,650
I am not. It's too soon.

221
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,460
Brooke, we're gonna miss the game.

222
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,290
I don't want to call him!

223
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:40,580
It violates all the
rules of dating etiquette.

224
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:43,090
I am gonna look desperate, he
has to do us a favor, 

225
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:44,750
and then he can make fun of me for it.

226
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,050
Oh, my god.

227
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,260
Fine.

228
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,200
I will call him, but if he does not sleep
with me after this, it is your fault 每

229
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,360
all of you.

230
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,460
I think I'm okay with that.

231
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,150
What?

232
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,310
My battery just died!

233
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:03,600
It's great!

234
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,980
Isn't that great?

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,720
Brooke, we're stuck!

236
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,100
Uh, stuck is not good.

237
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,130
Come sit down for a second, okay?

238
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,910
All right, just breathe
and close your eyes

239
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,160
and try and think of a place
that makes you happy and calm.

240
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,340
You got it? Where are you?

241
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,740
I'm with my dad. We're
walking near walden pond.

242
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,330
It's fall. The leaves are changing.

243
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,260
You're not here.

244
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,790
You're there.

245
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,250
Better?

246
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,560
Yeah.

247
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,680
Hey, mia, are you okay?

248
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,150
I'm great.

249
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,380
I actually think this
is kind of awesome.

250
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,890
I can finally get to know you guys.

251
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:43,290
I have questions.

252
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:45,070
No. Now is not the time.

253
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,230
Oh, come on. You guys
totally fascinate me.

254
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,840
Especially you, brooke.

255
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,150
Really?

256
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,700
Well, in that case, ask away, my dear.

257
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,850
Okay.

258
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,630
Like, you're really successful, right?

259
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,180
Like, really cool and rich?

260
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:01,920
Yes, yes, and yes.

261
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:07,460
So why do you let that horrible stink
of a mom boss you around all the time?

262
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:11,050
You should quit being so nosy.

263
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,560
Come on, brooke. You know she's not nice.

264
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,860
I'm not talking about my mom.

265
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,320
She doesn't appreciate you.

266
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,720
She is my mother, all right?

267
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,620
That doesn't make it right.

268
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,660
Okay.

269
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:25,050
It's time for the two new kids
to stay the hell out of it, 

270
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:29,890
and as for you two, I expect
you both to understand.

271
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,430
What's that supposed to mean?

272
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,690
You know what it means.

273
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,120
Neither of your moms were around 每

274
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,650
at least not in all the time
that I've been friends with you.

275
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:42,180
And I'm sorry for that, but what if you had
a chance to have them back in your lives?

276
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,940
Brooke, I would love to have them
back -- both of them, all right?

277
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,920
But I would hope that they'd be
coming back because they love me, 

278
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,710
not because they wanted to run my label.

279
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,030
Oh, the label i financed?

280
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,670
Easy. I'm with you.

281
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:54,150
Now.

282
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,460
You are with me now, peyton, 

283
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,330
but for the last four years, my
mom has been with me every day, 

284
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,450
helping me create a
pretty great company.

285
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,280
That'S...not true.

286
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:09,650
I was with you when you created that
pretty great company, and so was peyton.

287
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:13,240
Maybe your mom made it bigger, but
you created it all by yourself.

288
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,040
You did.

289
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,770
You made it great before your
mom even stepped into the picture.

290
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,550
You guys don't know anything about it.

291
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,130
Maybe not, but I do know that a
mother's love is unconditional, 

292
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:27,130
and you don't have to earn it, and you don't
have to sign a fashion label to keep it.

293
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,050
It just is.

294
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,500
You don't know anything about it.

295
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,520
you okay?

296
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,570
I'm thinking I can breakthis window.

297
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,400
Lindsey, somebody's gonna
comeget us out of here.

298
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:55,480
I can do it.

299
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:56,270
No--

300
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,680
Okay.

301
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:05,450
Jeez, that chairis really heavy.

302
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:13,400
Hi.

303
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:17,830
Check it out. I found
librarianglaufelte's stash.

304
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:20,040
We always knewshe was boozy.

305
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,850
Do you want some?

306
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,800
Whatcha readin'?

307
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:32,260
B. Davis.

308
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:38,870
She came upwith this, peyton.

309
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,350
The magazine, the high-end
clientele -- victoria did all of it.

310
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,510
I know.

311
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,190
But it's not called"V. Davis, " is it?

312
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,270
All those years growing up, I
just wanted her to see me.

313
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:05,100
To see me and appreciate
meand maybe love me.

314
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,460
And now that I have it, even if it's forthe
wrong reasons, it's hard to let it go.

315
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,200
Can you understand that?

316
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,990
Yeah.

317
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,140
This is terrible.

318
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:31,030
It's lucas' first game, we'restuck
in this stupid library.

319
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:32,600
Ah, I wish we knew the score.

320
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,140
Ravens down by 8.

321
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,260
Wait, let me refresh.

322
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,140
Ravens down by 10.

323
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:39,420
Are you online?

324
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,000
Yeah.

325
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,370
Brooke, peyton, come
here. We got internet.

326
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:45,430
Hey, you guys wantto see me at trick?

327
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,890
Okay, there's got to be a
waywe can use this to get out.

328
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,930
Or at least order a pizza. I'm starving.

329
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,500
No, that's it.

330
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,300
Do we need to be
thinkingabout food right now?

331
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:56,660
We order pizza online. We have it
delivered hereso we can get out.

332
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,760
Okay, blackwell's pizzeria
-- they are...open.

333
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,110
You can order online, and they deliver.

334
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:05,080
Nice.

335
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,920
So, what are we getting?

336
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,970
What kind of pizza?

337
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:11,420
I don't know. Mushroom and sausage.

338
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,390
- No mushroom, please.
- Brooke.

339
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:15,340
Actually, I'm totallywith
brooke. Canadian bacon?

340
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:16,700
Canadian bacon. Extra cheese.

341
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,310
- You guys --
- just order the damn pizza.

342
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,580
Do not yell at me.

343
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:21,150
I'll yell at you if
I want. Just order it!

344
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,400
Freaking sausage, freaking
canadian bacon, freaking mushroom 每

345
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,670
I want to getthe hell out of here!

346
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,280
We all want to get the
hell out of here, okay?

347
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,340
Don't yell at me!

348
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,080
Calm down!

349
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,940
God.

350
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,150
Just no mushroom.

351
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,190
There. It's ordered.

352
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:39,380
Are we all happy now?

353
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,480
What'd we get?

354
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,830
No mushroom, brooke, okay? No
"mush, " no "room" --no mushroom!

355
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,070
Everybody, please relax, okay? The pizza
guy's gonna come, he's gonna let us out, 

356
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,150
and maybe we'll makethe end of the game, 

357
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,420
so in the meantime, everybody
just calm down!

358
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:00,230
You did a great jobwith my record, haley.

359
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,980
Thank you.

360
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,950
Where did that come from?

361
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,620
I don't know. I just think we tear
each otherdown enough, you know?

362
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:12,750
And sometimesyou should tell people
the things thatyou love about them, 

363
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,640
like somethingthey're really great at
or a quality they havethat you admire, 

364
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:19,250
and, I don't know, you
did a really good job.

365
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,400
Courage.

366
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,080
Haley's courageous.

367
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,640
And strong.

368
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,310
And kind.

369
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,190
See, don't you feel
likeyou're pretty awesome now?

370
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,410
Yeah, I kind off do.

371
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,780
Okay, do me. What's great about me?

372
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,620
Your voiceis an amazing gift.

373
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,080
The fact that you came upwith this game.

374
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:37,660
Your boobs.

375
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,910
And your lips.

376
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,560
I would kill for lips
like that. You know?

377
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,880
And you've got good legs.

378
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,190
It's like
a whole --

379
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,710
okay. Before this turns intoa women-in-prison
film, I think we should move on.

380
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,380
Um, lindsey.

381
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:54,080
Your eyes are, like, not even fair.

382
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,720
- You're also one of the smartestpeople I know.
- I am not.

383
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,140
And you're classy.

384
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,390
You guys...

385
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,450
peyton, isn't theresomething nice
you'd like to sayabout lindsey?

386
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,010
She got decent tastein men.

387
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,830
This game sucks.

388
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,680
I'm intimidated by peyton.

389
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:31,390
I spent a yearediting a book that
was basicallya love letter to her.

390
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,050
I watched how caringand meticulous
lucas was with the words he chosefor her, 

391
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,010
like he was stillholding on to her.

392
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:49,220
Sometimes I thinkhe still is.

393
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:54,410
Which is why he proposedto you, right?

394
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,580
Yeah, I can see that.

395
00:20:58,410 --> 00:21:01,370
God, I hate this library.

396
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,630
I found it.

397
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,350
A way out?

398
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,050
No. Lucas' book. I never read it.

399
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,320
They replaced the carpet.

400
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,580
This is wherelucas and I hid out during the
school shooting, but they changed the carpet.

401
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,640
It doesn't match.

402
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:35,360
I'm not gonna tell youhow
to be with lindsey...

403
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,330
but most of your life, I've
known youto take the high road.

404
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:45,380
I knI know, brooke. I'm so sick of
looking at herand her precious ring.

405
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,240
You mean your precious ring?

406
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:56,640
All right. One more.

407
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,280
Score me. Score me, haley.

408
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:03,580
Ravens are down by 9.

409
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,460
Halftime.

410
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,400
Wait. Hold on.

411
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,950
Are you telling me lucas slept
with peyton, brooke, and you, lindsey?

412
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:14,590
Uh, yeah. Not all at the same time.

413
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,280
Jeez, haley, you sureyou
never got in on that?

414
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,890
Ew, he's like my brother.

415
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:21,400
I'm just saying.

416
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:22,460
Jamie looks a lot like him.

417
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,090
Ah, they're like twins.

418
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:24,990
They are not!

419
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:27,070
Yes, they are.

420
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:30,450
And what inbred moron is
takingso long with our pizza?

421
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,070
Well, well, well.

422
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:55,020
Oh, my god, 4, 000 hitsfor
my video at trick.

423
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,350
Listen to these comments.

424
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,280
"You rock. Where can I buy this?"

425
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,840
That's really great, mia.

426
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:04,780
"This song is awesome. I'd
love to seethis chick...naked."

427
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,150
It's just one comment.

428
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,390
No, wait, there's more.

429
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,840
"Another pop princesswho
can't sing or play.

430
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,370
She looks like she
smellslike dirty feet"?

431
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,430
What's wrong with people?

432
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,290
You need to stop. Do you know
what people usethe internet for?

433
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:19,020
- Porn and complaining.
- Yep.

434
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,400
But that's so not fair.

435
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,350
They have to knowthere's
somebody reading this.

436
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:25,190
It's the easiest thingin the
world to tear downsomebody's work.

437
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,790
The hard partis actually creating it.

438
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,890
It's criticismversus creation.

439
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:31,090
- Do you love making music?
- Yeah.

440
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,840
Okay, so, the restdoesn't matter.

441
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,980
Easy for you to say. They
didn'tsay you smell like feet.

442
00:23:38,030 --> 00:23:40,820
Oh, sticks and stones, mia.

443
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,890
Oh, right. This coming from the girl that
couldn't handle itwhen I said I didn't like her.

444
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,310
Okay.

445
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,400
Let's just check the scorecardon
this one, miss "pity me."

446
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:53,630
You dated the guy two
years ago, you disappeared, 

447
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:59,540
then you come back and expecthim to drop
everything for the loveof your bony, jobless ass.

448
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,520
Wtf?

449
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,400
Okay, D.U.I.

450
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,300
Nice work, haley.

451
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:07,360
Better saveol' drinky here before I kick her
spoiled assall the way back to walden pond.

452
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,550
Oh, yeah?

453
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:09,140
Yeah.

454
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:12,680
Guess this is the second time you'll
be bleeding all overthis library.

455
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,980
You think that's funny?!

456
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:21,050
Ken smith is in
the lib-ra-zee!

457
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,850
Oh, my god.

458
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,600
Brooke, it's s
tgoodo see --

459
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,690
no!

460
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,180
You idiot!

461
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,440
The door is locked!

462
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,450
No, it's not. I just walked in, brooke.

463
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:37,460
From the outside, tim.

464
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,960
The door is lockedfrom the outside.

465
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,270
We cannot get out!

466
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,950
Girl, chill.

467
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,040
I'll just call somebodyat the pizza
place and have themsend someone 每

468
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,950
I left my phone in my scooter.

469
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,000
Motorcycle.

470
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,110
It's a motorcycle.

471
00:24:56,910 --> 00:25:01,120
Well, since we're
lockedin here all alone...

472
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:04,240
who wants a piece?

473
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,740
Extra sausage.

474
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,630
Ravens trail by 9.

475
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,040
Sold-out crowd.

476
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,640
Come on, mouth. There's
a great story here.

477
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,360
Find it.

478
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,000
Oh, my god.

479
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:42,310
If you had to eat any partof a person
to stay alive, what would you eat?

480
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:43,880
What?

481
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:48,150
Like -- I don't know -- say we
ran out of foodand haley died.

482
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,750
Thanks a lot.

483
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,610
Okay, someone else dies, and
we need to survive.

484
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:53,290
What do you eat?

485
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,760
I know what I'mstarting with.

486
00:25:54,770 --> 00:25:56,440
Don't say it, perv.

487
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,210
Love handles.

488
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,050
I'd make, like, beef jerkyout
of their love handles.

489
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,740
You could snack on thatfor days.

490
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,870
I so would not
eatsomeone's love handles.

491
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,400
Well, you're gonna starve, and
we're all gonna eat you.

492
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,380
No one gonna's eat me, either.

493
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,910
No!

494
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:18,400
You know, i could eat
your necklike a vampire.

495
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:19,950
You guys, seriously.

496
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:20,680
What's the big deal?

497
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:22,270
You're dead, and I'm hungry.

498
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,510
Yeah, don't you want usto live?

499
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,930
We're hungry, brooke.

500
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,580
Okay.

501
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:34,400
Chow down, but I am gonna
haunteach and every one of you.

502
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,310
I believe in ghosts.

503
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,020
Totally.

504
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:39,370
Yeah, don't evenget me started.

505
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,610
Do you believein ghosts, lin?

506
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,940
Um... I think if someonedies suddenly, 

507
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:48,590
especially before their
time, maybe they get confused.

508
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,860
They don't knowto leave a place.

509
00:26:52,270 --> 00:26:54,580
You think they're stillhere, then?

510
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,450
Jimmy edwards and keith?

511
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,680
I wish you were heretonight, jim.

512
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,270
We were supposed to dothis together.

513
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,520
And this is a pictureof my son.

514
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,690
A lot of people sayhe looks like me, 

515
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,290
but I'm not quite
surehe's that handsome.

516
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,460
He's really something.

517
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:34,330
What's his name?

518
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,430
Nathan.

519
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,130
Mine's snow day.

520
00:27:41,570 --> 00:27:43,160
My happy place.

521
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,250
Lindsey's is walden pond.

522
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:46,000
Mine's a snow day in ohio.

523
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,130
No school.

524
00:27:47,170 --> 00:27:48,880
I'd stay in bedunder the warm covers, 

525
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,540
and my mom would bring mehot chocolate.

526
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,650
How 'bout you, peyton? Your mom ever
bring youhot chocolate on a snow day?

527
00:27:54,670 --> 00:28:00,060
No, I di I didn't have
a whole lotof snow days.

528
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,020
Brooke and I did builda
pretty killer snow fort once.

529
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,870
And you sat in it, and you worried
that your liveswere about to change.

530
00:28:06,910 --> 00:28:11,580
Just because you edited a bookabout my
life doesn't mean you know anythingabout me.

531
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,810
I didn't mean anything by it.

532
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:17,060
I was just -- it's
a beautiful story.

533
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,030
That's nice, mia.

534
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,330
Thanks. I've had this melody forever
and just don't havethe lyrics yet.

535
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,650
Why don't you keep playing
itand maybe we can help you?

536
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:32,660
I think maybe we should probably
just work on thatin the studio, alone.

537
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,880
Oh, for god's sakes. What am
I gonna do --steal mia's song?

538
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,430
I don't know. Songs? Friends?

539
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:39,920
What about you, scraggly?

540
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,990
I heard you stole lucasfrom brooke once.

541
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,010
Pot, meet kettle.

542
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:45,460
Ass, meet face.

543
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:50,830
Pot, meet kettle, ass, meet face

544
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:51,970
I don't thinkthat's gonna work, guys.

545
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,270
Wait! That's hot!

546
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,350
No, drop that bomb
again! I got something.

547
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,450
Yeah?

548
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:57,920
All right, ready?

549
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:58,750
Okay.

550
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,770
One, two, three, four...

551
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,100
straight from the
ghetto, packing wood like geppetto

552
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,810
ain't gonna bathe till
I look like jared leto

553
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:09,780
Nice.

554
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,050
Don't laugh at him.

555
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,320
Uh --
you're right.

556
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,150
Creation versus criticism.

557
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,900
Let me try one.

558
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,480
Two, three, four...

559
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:27,280
my name's peyton fake, blond peyton

560
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,760
I don't have a boyfriend

561
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,290
'cause I'm a bitch

562
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,820
Play it again, mia.

563
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,600
Guys, we need to stop.

564
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,220
Mia.

565
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:41,010
One, two, three, four...

566
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:44,830
her name's lindsey
--man-faced lindsey

567
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:51,830
and her fianc? proposedto me
first with the very same ring!

568
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,980
- You're lying.
- Oh, you didn't know?

569
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:59,460
- Peyton.
- No, is she gonna cry?

570
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:01,700
- Stop it.
- Go ahead --let's cry, little rich girl.

571
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,520
I said stop it.

572
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,430
Is daddy gonna throw youa great, big, huge wedding
at walden pond for his littlecrybaby daughter?

573
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,950
Peyton, you don't knowwhat
you're talking about!

574
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,720
It's fine, haley.

575
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:12,830
Daddy'sgonna make everything better for the little
rich girl thatgot everything she ever wanted!

576
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,060
He's dead!

577
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,310
All right, peyton?

578
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,430
He's dead.

579
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,120
He died two years agofrom cancer, 

580
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:21,670
but not until he couldn't
walkor talk or even recognize me.

581
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,220
Does that make you happy?

582
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,180
Does that make you feel better?

583
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,290
That his death is with meevery day, 

584
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,690
that I was the one who
hadto turn off the ventilator

585
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,520
because my mother wastoo
destroyed to do it?

586
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:36,420
You wantto hear the sound he made
before he tookthat last breath?

587
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:41,920
Oh, 'cause I can still hear
itexactly how it sounded.

588
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,350
Oh, does thatmake you happy?

589
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,590
- Are you glad that my lifeisn't perfect?
- lindsey

590
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:53,060
I used to admire the
peytonfrom the book.

591
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:57,800
She seemed so noble...kind.

592
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:02,800
I wish she were here, peyton.

593
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:05,250
That version of you.

594
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,710
What happened to her?

595
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:45,930
I was true as the sky is blue

596
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:53,250
but I couldn't soon
say the same for you, 

597
00:31:53,260 --> 00:32:03,950
no, no so now I find denial in my eyes

598
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:12,960
I'm mesmerizedby the -the picture
that's in my mind now oh-ho, 

599
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:21,330
so tell me when I finally seeyour
shattered heart what it is, 

600
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:28,490
yeah 'cause I don't want
tokeep on believing in illusions

601
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:35,140
no, no, no 'cause I've seen your
act and I know all the facts

602
00:32:35,150 --> 00:32:36,720
I'm still in love with you, 

603
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:39,430
I wish you were here

604
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,770
and it ain't hard to see
who you are underneath

605
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,370
I'm still in love with you, 

606
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:52,470
I wish you were I wish you were here, 

607
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,940
I wish you were here 

608
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,760
God, the last time I was trappedin
the school was the shooting.

609
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:24,440
You know how lindsey and igot so close?

610
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,040
She was, um, editing lucas' book, 

611
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,370
and I still wasn't really sureabout her

612
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,710
'cause I was rooting for lucasto
be with my friend peyton...

613
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:37,030
or maybe even brooke.

614
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,150
Um, anyway, she -- she was working
on the chapterabout the shooting, 

615
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,670
and she said to me, "I want
this to be lucas'best writing --

616
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,910
the best he has in him
-because peyton deserves it."

617
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:01,660
"Jimmy and keith deserve
it, and that day deserves it."

618
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,220
And we've been friendsever since.

619
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,220
can I please talkwith you?

620
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:27,280
I'm sorry. God, lindsey, I'm sorry.

621
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,860
I am so sorry for what I
saidabout your father, okay?

622
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,830
I lost my mom to cancer, and I...

623
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:35,780
I'm sorry.

624
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,660
I don't know what it
is, but for whatever reason, 

625
00:34:37,670 --> 00:34:40,480
you bring outthe insecurities in me, 

626
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:44,350
and I end up being the
worstpossible version of myself.

627
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,000
Welcome to the club.

628
00:34:49,950 --> 00:34:53,950
Haley told me what you said about wanting
to get thatchapter right in the book, 

629
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,760
the one aboutthe school shooting.

630
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,260
And I think that's what
makes itso hard, you know 每

631
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:06,410
the fact that lucas has foundthis person
that's so great and that has sucha big heart.

632
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:10,440
And it was never my ring.

633
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,190
I was just tryingto hurt you.

634
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,930
And the only reasonI recognized it is 'cause that's
the ringkeith gave karen when he proposed to her, 

635
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:23,950
before he walkedinto this school
and never walked out again.

636
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:29,340
So you have to know how muchlucas
loves you if he wanted youto have it.

637
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,490
Why would you tell me that?

638
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:36,160
So you stop doubting it.

639
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,260
So we stop doing this.

640
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,310
I mean, god, you gave mea clean slate, 

641
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:44,150
and I said something
dumbthat I didn't even mean, 

642
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:47,270
and I was just too
stubbornto take it back.

643
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:52,870
I guess it's obvious that I'm
not the peytonin the book anymore.

644
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:55,760
The truth is, I never was.

645
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,830
I think you were.

646
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,390
And I think you still are.

647
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:05,020
It's just... you're
notthat couple anymore.

648
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:10,390
And in a way, it breaks my heart, 'cause
I really was rootingfor them.

649
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,670
But lucas and I have
writtenour own chapter now, 

650
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,930
and that's a chapteri
won't apologize for.

651
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,030
No, you don't have to.

652
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,780
And you don't have a
man faceor a big ass.

653
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:31,480
The fact is, you havea
pretty great ass, so...

654
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:33,350
Okay.

655
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:37,350
Before this turns intoa
women-in-prison film...

656
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,900
maybe we should move on.

657
00:36:40,930 --> 00:36:45,040
Moving on sounds... overdue.

658
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,860
"N"?

659
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:51,740
Mono.

660
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,620
Monkey.

661
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:54,360
Yes!

662
00:36:54,410 --> 00:36:59,290
Well, guess it's time for
meto get back to work.

663
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,860
But you're forgetting
something, short bus.

664
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,230
The door's locked.

665
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,490
No big deal.

666
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,820
What?

667
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:16,250
Oh, my god! Did you know how
to do thatthis whole time?!

668
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:18,950
Why didn't you saysomething?

669
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,890
I miss you guys.

670
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:26,270
Nobody keeps in touch anymore.

671
00:37:44,070 --> 00:37:45,890
Would you look at that?

672
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,600
You can still see where
dan'sjersey used to hang.

673
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,060
It's kind of eerie, huh?

674
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,870
You know, that's weird. I
expected to see lindsey here.

675
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,220
Have you talkedto haley tonight?

676
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:58,930
Now that you mention it, no, but
I've been tryingto avoid her.

677
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,880
What's going on?

678
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:04,850
You kissed peyton, didn't you?

679
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,890
Okay, I know you want to call
mea dick, and that's fine --

680
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,940
I kissed carrie.

681
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:10,950
You're a dick.

682
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,630
I know.

683
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:17,500
Actually, she kissed me, but it still
happened, and I feel terribleabout it, man.

684
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,430
I'm not that guy, luke.

685
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:22,950
Are you sure? I mean, if you hadanother
chance to do it, would you do it again?

686
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:26,440
No. Absolutely not. I love haley.

687
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,100
Okay.

688
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:34,740
Luke, every time I try to keepsomething
from haley, it just makes it worse.

689
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:36,450
I'm gonna tell her.

690
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,600
She deserves to know.

691
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,510
Ready to go home now, daddy?

692
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:50,130
I got to stop beingmy father and start
being the fathermy son thinks I am.

693
00:38:56,600 --> 00:39:00,690
There was a high schoolbasketball
game tonight somewhere in america.

694
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,990
A team won, and a team lost.

695
00:39:06,450 --> 00:39:08,990
That's not the real story.
