You don't -- You 
don't understand.

49
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,960
I've been holding this 
in For a really long time.

50
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,640

You look like crap.

Yeah,just been dealing 
With some stuff,you know?

55
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,850
Besides,I'm way too wired to sleep.

56
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,740
Do you realize,In less than 24 hours,

57
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,000
We're gonna be State champs?

58
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,670
I don't think so.

59
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,110
What? Come on,man.

60
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,380
With you,me,skills --

61
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,750
No way pontiac beats us,You know?

62
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,230
We can't win it,luke.

63
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,810
We're not going to.

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,800
I needed the money,okay?

65
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,360
You said it was over

66
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,560
That it was just one game.

67
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,410
It was just one game. They 
said It was just one game,okay?

68
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,200
But...

69
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,200
Now we have to lose.ok?

70
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:53,540
God,nathan,What are 
you talking about?

71
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,630
This is whitey's Last game ever.

72
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,690
He's been chasing this 
dream For 35 years.

73
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,380
What about whitey?

74
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,830
Or mouth?

75
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,200
Or skills,with college?

76
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,780
What about me,nate?

77
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,410
This is the last game I'll ever play.

78
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,950
I'm sorry.

79
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,260
You know...

80
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,310
The night before 
I joined the team,

81
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,640
We battled each 
other On this court.

82
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,550
I guess we'll be doing 
The same thing tomorrow.

83
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,720
Lucas,you only play 15 minutes a game.

84
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:33,990
You can't change this.

85
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,510
I can try.

86
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,560
And i hated you 
That night we played.

87
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:43,140
I thought you changed,But...

88
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,950
Guess i was wrong.

89
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,030
Good evening,Ladies 
and gentlemen.

90
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,050
And welcome to what 
may be The biggest day

91
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,770
In the history Of tree 
hill ravens basketball.

92
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,770
10,000 fans will pack 
The rbc center tonight

93
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,610
To see the ravens battle 
Top-ranked pontiac academy

94
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,520
For the state championship.

95
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,260
For coach whitey durham,

96
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:14,890
Only 32 minutes remain 
In a long and storied career.

97
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,460
A little early,Aren't you?

98
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,100
I know,coach, But.

99
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,210
i've been waiting For 
this day my whole life.

100
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,530
Me too,son.

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,040
Me too.

102
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,790
You said,"oh"? Hold on.

103
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,920
Peyton say,"i'm in love With you," 

104
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,680
and you say,"oh."

105
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:36,920
Nice work,player.

106
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,360
She caught me by surprise. 
What was i supposed to say?

107
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,030
Not "oh."

108
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,400
Okay,What else did you say?

109
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:45,990
I mumbled something about us 
Being friends,and then i left.

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,540
And you believe that 

111
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:49,470
That you and p. 
Sawyer Are just friends?

112
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,070
Look,you know what,
Skills? For a long time,

113
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,830
i thought We'd be something more.

114
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,360
It just never seemed To work out.

115
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,830
At a certain point,
You got to face the fact

116
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,630
That it's not meant to be.

117
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,590
Even if she wants more?

118
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,350
She's just confused 
She's had a hard year,

119
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,970
And i happened to be there 
To rescue her a few times.

120
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,070
Maybe you're the one Who confused...

121
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,100
'Cause you didn't just happen 
To rescue her a few times.

122
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,620
You didn't just happen to 
run Back into school that day

123
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,530
Or save her From psycho derek.

124
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,570
Peyton happened to be there,

125
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,580
But you <i>chose</i> to be there.

126
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,430
So maybe you ought to 
think About that.

127
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,680
No,when the boy buys The balloon,

128
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,180
It's a total volume Of one cubic foot.

129
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,910
If he blows up the balloon 
At .1 cubic feet per minute,

130
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,010
How fast is the radius 
Of the balloon increasing

131
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,520
When he only blows it up Halfway?

132
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,970
I don't know about the 
balloon,But this blows.

133
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,200
When am i gonna ever 
need To know this?

134
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,520
When you're failing calculus 
And want to graduate.

135
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:49,100
Wait,That's right now.

136
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:56,970
Okay,let's take a look At 
mr. Miller's last test.

137
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,470
Why don't we take a look 
At mr. Miller's next test?

138
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,420
That's where they keep them,Right?

139
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,380
How do you know that?

140
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,850
I hear things.

141
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,510
So,how come If you're a student,

142
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,720
You have access To all the tests?

143
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:14,900
It's no wonder You have a 4.0 gpa.

144
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:16,980
are you kidding me? It's 
called An honor system,

145
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,970
And it's not like i can 
access Tests to my own classes.

146
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:23,590
You need a few extra bucks. 
I need a few answers.

147
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,190
How about you sell me the 
test? Name your price.

148
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,190
Do you know the meaning 
Of the word "honor"?

149
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,840
Of course you don't. It's you.

150
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:33,210
You know,i really -- i just 
Can't deal with this right now.

151
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,850
Let's just pick this up At the game.

152
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:39,160
The game? The state championship?

153
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,840
You really do hate me,Don't you?

154
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:42,420
Yep. See you later.

155
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,960
We missed you At the banquet.

156
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,010
Your son was named The team's mvp.

157
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,300
Karen...

158
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:03,840
Take a shower,Get dressed,

159
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,570
And see if you can find 
What's left of your dignity.

160
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,090
Nathan is playing His last 
high-school Basketball game ever,

161
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,410
And you're going to it 
Whether you like it or not.

162
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:24,440
So,i got scouts From 
three different schools

163
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:26,230
Coming to watch us play Tonight.

164
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:29,280
Man,we win this thing, I'm gonna 
have my pick Of scholarships.

165
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:36,630
You gonna tell him he's not 
Going to college or should i?

166
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,130
It's one game. 

167
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,130
It's one High-school 
basketball game.

168
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,470
You think it really 
matters If we don't win?

169
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,030
I don't know. 

170
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,370
How about you ask them?

171
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,920
I can't believe whitey 
Wouldn't let us ride the bus.

172
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,870
And thanks to haley,
We're gonna miss the game

173
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,280
Because you had to stop 
and pee Every other mile.

174
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,420
This sucks.

175
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,680
I'm pregnant,And i'm 
not feeling very well.

176
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:16,920
I don't mean it sucks 
Because we're gonna be late.

177
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:19,250
It sucks Because peyton's here.

178
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:21,310
You guys seriously need 
To work things out.

179
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,330
I mean,when i was 
In fat-girl therapy...

180
00:08:24,970 --> 00:08:26,780
Look,maybe role-playing.

181
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,190
It's when everyone speaks 
As someone else. It might help.

182
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,230
It could make things horrible. 
That could be fun,too.

183
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,970
***********

184
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,530
My name's rachel,and i'm a 
Dumbass who's failing calculus,

185
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,770
And i really like to 
hit On married guys.

186
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,360
See? Fun.

187
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,950
Kind of like When i 
slept with nathan.

188
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,760
Damn,that was good.

189
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,470
Okay. Peyton here.

190
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,740
I like to steal boys,

191
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:51,110
but i'm Afraid to tell 
them how i feel.

192
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,360
Speaking of stealing...

193
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,730
Hi,i'm brooke,and i stole 
My friend peyton's artwork

194
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,360
So i could put it On 
my clothing line,

195
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,500
And i never even said Thank you.

196
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,290
Ok, Peyton here again.

197
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,580
Have i mentioned 
That if you love me,

198
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,090
You're probably Gonna die soon?

199
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,380
See mothers one and two. 

200
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,840
Brooke.

201
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,000
My name's rachel,And i have red hair.

202
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,200
Oh,i am gonna Kick your ass.

203
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,890
Hey,hey,stop it. Stop it!

204
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,850
I never congratulated 
you On your pregnancy.

205
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:41,410
Although you have to 
admit It's pretty strange.

206
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:44,120
Strange? How?

207
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,260
How keith was there 
For dan's child

208
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:52,380
And now dan wants to 
be there For keith's.

209
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,380
You really gonna do that To nathan?

210
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:00,760
It's one night,deb.

211
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,290
It's one night For your son.

212
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,520
You know,the pacing's Not 
gonna make me any smarter.

213
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,670
Besides,the stress can't 
be Good for the baby.

214
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,130
I'm not pacing for you. 
I'm pacing for nathan.

215
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,520
He's worked most of 
his life For this.

216
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,500
I just want it to 
be perfect For him.

217
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:30,570
Just so you know,I 
wouldn't have slt with him,

218
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,370
Even if he wanted to.

219
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,120
But we definitely Would have made out.

220
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:36,810
Can you just finish The exam?

221
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,590
I have to go To the bathroom again.

222
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:47,040
You were wrong.

223
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:49,550
You said i was afraid to 
tell Lucas that i loved him,

224
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,340
But i did. I told him last night.

225
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,470
He doesn't want to be With me.

226
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,490
You can smile now.

227
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,440
You believe this,man?

228
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,860
Me and my boy representing 
For the river court.

229
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,110
Hey,how these pills 
work,Anyway? I mean,

230
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,370
How they keep you alive?

231
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:19,180
They slow down my heart rate 
So i can't go full-speed.

232
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,820
That's why whitey only 
lets me Play part time.

233
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:25,260
Maybe he only play you part 
time 'Cause he got me full time.

234
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,740
Listen,I got to talk to you.

235
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,150
Nathan's gonna throw 
The game tonight.

236
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,660
Remember when we saw him 
talking To that daunte guy?

237
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:39,300
He's going to.

238
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,570
- We got to tell whitey,man.   
- We can't.

239
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,530
That'll break his heart 
More than losing this game.

240
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,680
What about my heart? 
What about your heart?

241
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,390
What about the other 
nine guys On the team?

242
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,870
I know.

243
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,000
And that's why We 
got to win this game

244
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,830
You and me.

245
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,500
How?

246
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,370
We freeze out nathan...

247
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,350
And play The game of our lives.

248
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,450
Haley?

249
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,220
Come on,you've been in 
there Forever. We got to go.

250
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,060
Haley...

251
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,680
Oh,my god.

252
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:04,100
Let's go,ravens,let's go!

253
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,180
Let's go.

254
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,870
- How you doing,haley?   
- Not so good.

255
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,360
I'm sure You'll be next.

256
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,560
Maybe we should try to 
get In touch with nathan.

257
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:38,290
No,i don't want him to know,
Not during the game.

258
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,730
Sara lestage?

259
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,200
Okay,this is a bunch of crap. Come on.

260
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,480
Look,our friend has 
been Waiting a long time.

261
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:48,920
So?

262
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,950
So? She's pregnant,And 
she's in a lot of pain.

263
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,190
I know cheerleaders 
expect Special treatment,

264
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,230
But guess what -- i never liked 
The cheerleaders in my school.

265
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,070
It's probably Because 
you looked like that.

266
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,180
Guess who's gonna 
wait A little longer now.

267
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:05,610
Like hell she is. Come on,haley.

268
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:07,110
Excuse me!

269
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,530
I'll call security.

270
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,860
Yeah,call security. Why 
don't you call the police?

271
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,610
Tell them you're discriminating 
Against cheerleaders.

272
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,460
Can we get a doctor,Please?

273
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:17,930
listen to me, I don't care how special 
you are In your little high school.

274
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,700
You can't just barge in here.

275
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:21,750
- What's going on?   
- What's going on is

276
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,200
Our friend is pregnant 
And she's in a lot of pain

277
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,990
And this bitch is about 
To get her ass kicked.

278
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,540
Okay,just calm down. 
I'll take a look at her.

279
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:30,960
You can all wait in the 
lobby And cheer for something.

280
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:31,990
Thanks,you guys.

281
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,610
You're gonna be okay,Haley.

282
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,100
- Slut.bitch.whore. 
- Thank you.

283
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:53,070
Great day For basketball.

284
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,600
Better day For making some money.

285
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:58,080
Nathan's gonna carry The shame 
of this for The rest of his life.

286
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:00,570
Maybe you should have helped 
him Out when he needed it.

287
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,760
Oh,we are almost there,Deb.

288
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,510
Deb?

289
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,330
You're gonna be fine.

290
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,400
Ligament pain brought 
on By stress is common.

291
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:30,130
Your test results don't 
reveal Anything abnormal.

292
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,620
Here's your term of your 
Pregnancy,your baby's sex.

293
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:34,470
T-cell count is normal.

294
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,050
My baby's sex.

295
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,620
Um...i'm sorry.

296
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,680
Did you not want to know?

297
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,720
No,it's okay.

298
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:49,110
Okay,folks,this is the One 
we've all been waiting for.

299
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,680
It's the tree hill ravens 
And pontiac high school

300
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,550
For the north carolina State 
basketball championship,

301
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:55,990

00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,720
Barbecue sauce.

304

Gigi silveri,Ladies and gentlemen.

305
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,060
1,2,3...ravens!

306
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,760
Where's haley at?

307
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:15,010
She's probably putting 
money Down on pontiac.

308
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:32,380
Pontiac's jarvis will jump it up 
Against tree hill's Nathan scott.

309
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,940
And the ravens win the tip.

310
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,690
Ball!

311
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,990
Dude,Give me the ball!

312
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:54,080
Lucas scott with The 
first basket of the night.

313
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:56,700
He looked a lot like The 
old lucas on that shot.

314
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,140
Another turnover By nathan scott,

315
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:12,810
And jarvis slams it home.

316
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,450
Pontiac leads by 9.

317
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,930
Ball!

318
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,140
Skills,Give me the ball,man!

319
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,140
Skills takes it to 
the hoop And scores.

320
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:32,040
The ravens still trail by 10.

321
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:37,060
Jarvis beats scott again 
For another slam dunk.

322
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,680
Lucas scott With another shot in.

323
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:52,580
He sure picked the right night To 
have his best game Of the season.

324
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:57,130
Still,the ravens are digging A deep 
hole Against this great Pontiac team.

325
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,880
So,what exactly did he say To you

326
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,330
Lucas,When you told him.

327
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,960
- What?  
- He said,"oh."

328
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,750
Boys can be so dumb.

329
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,130
Yeah,well,i probably Shouldn't
have been surprised.

330
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:35,770
I asked him once Who he wanted 
next to him When his dreams came true.

331
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,320
He said you.

332
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,610
Why would you Tell me that?

333
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,680
I would have given anything 
To hear him say me.

334
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:54,240
Scott tries to double-team,*******

335
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,470
**********

336
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,820
Hey,how about you get Off the floor?

337
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,990

339
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,120
Come on,i dare you.

340
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,980
Just before halftime,

341
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,860
And a fight has broken out 
Between the tree hill ravens

342
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:19,400
And the tree hill ravens.

343
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,210
Well,that's how we 
started This season.

344
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,440
I guess that's how we'll end it.

345
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,000
At the half end, Pontiac's 
leading tree hill,

346
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:33,920
36 to 21.

347
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,680
<i>i have to say it's 
incredibly unfortunate</i>

348
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:44,300
<i>how the ravens have come 
apart at the seams.</i>

349
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:46,960
<i>after hanging together 
through thick and thin,</i>

350
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:48,460
<i>through good times and bad,</i>

351
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:52,230
<i>for these ravens to fall 
this far is stunning.</i>

352
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,960
<i>and the worst thing 
about it all is this --</i>

353
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:59,690
<i>i mean,after a stellar career,</i>

354
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,400
<i>perhaps the best ever to 
wear a ravens uniform,</i>

355
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,520
<i>you find yourself questioning 
scott's character.</i>

356
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,480
<i>to walk away from the game 
on these terms is shameful.</i>

357
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,340
<i>it's a disgrace,really.</i>

358
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:13,800
<i>whitey durham is the 
picture of a broken man,</i>

359
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,910
<i>and you have to wonder 
if this opportunity</i>

360
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,880
<i>will ever come around again 
for the tree hill ravens.</i>

361
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,680
That was 18 years ago.

362
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,770
Most of you Weren't even born yet.

363
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,570
Back then,i didn't know

364
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,280
That there'd only be one 
chance To erase those words 

365
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,680
This chance.

366
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,590
The rest of your 
life Is a long time.

367
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,190
If you lose,you lose.

368
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,220
But don't lose this way 

369
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,350
Playing selfish,

370
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,110
Bickering with each 
other On the court.

371
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,390
I promise you...

372
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,370
It'll stay with you.

373
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,760
It'll stay with you.

374
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,670
Six turnovers  

375
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,260
that's not The nathan scott i know.

376
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,970
I got worried When 
i didn't see you.

377
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,940
It's okay. Everything's fine.

378
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:28,710
Everything's fine.

379
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,090
I need to ask you A question.

380
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,540
If i don't go to duke,

381
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,000
If i don't play 
College basketball...

382
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,610
I mean,if today is the 
best It ever gets for me...

383
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,470
Will that be enough?

384
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,770
Of course.

385
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,070
Nathan,as long As 
you're a good husband

386
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,950

It's a boy,nathan.

390
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,730
You're gonna have a son.

391
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,350
Although,I have to tell you,

392
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,660
Someday he's gonna 
tease His father

393
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:12,510
For playing like crap In 
the state championship.

394
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,970
You might want To change that.

395
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:24,250
And nathan scott has come Out 
on fire in the second half,

396
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,020

Trying to win. You gonna help me?

But you can help me.

402
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:47,130
A steal by lucas scott,And 
the ravens are heating up.

403
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,390

fine Moral victory.

You know,say what you will About the 
ravages of sports In this corporate age

472
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,920
Where overpaid athletes 
expect Prima donna treatment,

473
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,750
But there is still 
something So unifying

474
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,810
About sport In its purest form --

475
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,240
When athletes rise Above themselves

476
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,540
And touch greatness And,in doing so,

477
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:19,430
Remind us all that we also 
have Greatness inside of us.

478
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,160

00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,620
- It's you.   
- What?

522
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,720
When all my dreams come true,
The one i want next to me 

523
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,490
It's you.

524
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,350
It's you,peyton.

525
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,880
Look,i want to make a deal With you,

526
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,220
Try to make things right.

527
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:00,580
You don't have that 
kind Of money or power.

528
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,840
I'm not an idiot. I know 
You have people to answer to.

529
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,580
But you built your plan On the 
shoulders Of a kid with a dream.

530
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,640
Can't blame him for going 
A little weak in the knees.

531
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:11,050
weak. You think he looked weak?

532
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,720
'Cause he looked pretty damn Strong to me.

533
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,750
I'll be in touch.

534
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,860
You know,I didn't pick nathan 
Because he was the star Of the team.

535
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:29,640
I picked him 'Cause 
he was dan scott's son.

536
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:33,750
Turns out the 
kid Actually has a soul.

537
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:39,890
Never would have bet on that.

538
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,890
You and peyton Together now?

539
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,060
I saw the kiss.

540
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,230
Maybe.

541
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:09,370
It's about time,man.

542
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:12,240
Hey. You played Like a champ tonight.

543
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,820
I played like half a champ.

544
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,640
If you wouldn't have made That shot,

545
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:17,510
I would have never forgiven 
Myself,so thank you.

546

So what are you 
gonna do About daunte?

Deal with it,i guess.

549
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,850
Whatever he does to me,I can take it.

550
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:32,430
Besides,if this was The 
last game i ever played,

653
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,170
<i>he's never gonna forgive himself.</i>

654
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,870

carry the kid out of here tonight </i>

656
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,820
<i>and never bring him back.</i>

657

<i>i have never seen some 
of these kids so happy.</i>

658
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,310

00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:58,960
<i>and there at the center 
of it all is whitey durham</i>
