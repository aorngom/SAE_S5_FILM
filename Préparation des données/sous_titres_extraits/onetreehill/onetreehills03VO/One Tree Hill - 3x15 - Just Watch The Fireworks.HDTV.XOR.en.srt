1
00:00:00,098 --> 00:00:01,412
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,497 --> 00:00:05,971
In 1955, students at Tree Hill high school

3
00:00:06,057 --> 00:00:09,844
created a time capsule to be opened in 50 years.

4
00:00:09,923 --> 00:00:13,138
Within the next week, each of you will videotape your thoughts.

5
00:00:13,203 --> 00:00:16,578
In 10 years, I'll probably be married to someone like Marvin McFadden.

6
00:00:16,661 --> 00:00:19,138
You all probably call him senator McFadden.

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,091
I bet you're going to have it all someday.

8
00:00:21,392 --> 00:00:23,578
Yeah, I'm thinking of running for senator.

9
00:00:24,382 --> 00:00:26,933
I look back on the tour, I'm not, like, proud of it,

10
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:28,891
because I know that weren't proud of me.

11
00:00:28,992 --> 00:00:30,220
Is that what you think?

12
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:33,075
Luke, you mind if we get a few words before your first game?

13
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,552
Yeah, we're sports announcers.

14
00:00:34,653 --> 00:00:37,094
Jimmy Edwards, my partner and friend.

15
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:38,237
Marry me.

16
00:00:42,346 --> 00:00:43,394
I have cancer.

17
00:00:43,497 --> 00:00:46,109
I want you to be here when the album comes out.

18
00:00:46,236 --> 00:00:47,714
I will be here, Peyton.

19
00:00:47,991 --> 00:00:48,954
Ellie?

20
00:01:37,383 --> 00:01:39,734
So you want me to tell you something about myself.

21
00:01:41,061 --> 00:01:42,614
I don't have anything to say.

22
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,095
Even if I did, you'd be wrong to believe me.

23
00:01:49,535 --> 00:01:50,890
Trust is a lie.

24
00:01:52,382 --> 00:01:54,028
Nobody ever knows anyone.

25
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:01,506
You know, people think that if you love somebody hard enough,

26
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:03,165
then everything's just going to work out.

27
00:02:04,317 --> 00:02:05,416
People are wrong.

28
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:09,417
50 years from now, I hope you got what you wanted, Haley.

29
00:02:09,772 --> 00:02:13,019
But getting married to you was the worst mistake of my life.

30
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,571
Here's a little advice -- never get married.

31
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,191
In the end, you'll only be miserable.

32
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,371
Pretty much dated all the hot girls.

33
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:28,385
Freshmen, seniors...

34
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:30,697
yeah, it's good times.

35
00:02:30,864 --> 00:02:32,452
Currently, I'm, uh...

36
00:02:33,273 --> 00:02:34,753
dating Brooke Davis.

37
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:38,758
What else, um, oh, yeah, this is this new girls, Anna...

38
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:42,580
And to think, I was this close to cutting school today.

39
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:44,022
Tim Smith, huh?

40
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:45,513
Score.

41
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:51,743
You're sure it's the time capsule from last year?

42
00:02:51,844 --> 00:02:52,910
Damn sure.

43
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:55,167
Somebody uncorked it early.

44
00:02:56,351 --> 00:02:58,617
I don't know, coach. Looks fine here.

45
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:04,354
Just getting along is kind of new to us.

46
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,394
We'll just shut down the feed.

47
00:03:09,504 --> 00:03:13,581
Once we remove the door, because whoever did this broke the key off in the damn lock.

48
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:17,032
I'll call the locksmith. Maybe you better call out the S.W.A.T. team.

49
00:03:17,136 --> 00:03:18,690
This could turn ugly.

50
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:22,820
But that doesn't change the fact that I need to get closer to my father,

51
00:03:22,931 --> 00:03:24,994
because if I can get closer to him,

52
00:03:25,326 --> 00:03:27,703
maybe I can find a way to beat him

53
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:29,983
once and for all...

54
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:35,375
and set the people that I love free.

55
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:39,523
I just hope I have the strength to tear him down for good.

56
00:03:47,508 --> 00:03:49,309
I'll probably be married to someone like Marvin McFadden.

57
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:53,254
You guys probably call him senator McFadden, but we just call him Mouth.

58
00:03:53,372 --> 00:03:56,185
So if you're watching this in 2055,

59
00:03:56,284 --> 00:03:59,619
there really needs to be some sort of record of my body at its peak.

60
00:03:59,731 --> 00:04:00,889
No, wait.

61
00:04:01,215 --> 00:04:03,843
We have to turn this off right now.

62
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:06,414
What the hell.

63
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,244
Cut the damn power.

64
00:04:09,358 --> 00:04:10,849
Can somebody do something?!

65
00:04:10,967 --> 00:04:12,882
Somebody needs to do something. Excuse me, move!

66
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:17,317
Now, if you guys are space aliens, you probably have three of these,

67
00:04:17,412 --> 00:04:20,564
but I haven't gotten any complaints so far.

68
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:37,064
Actually, if you're aliens, you probably have eight sets of eyes,

69
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:39,098
which would mean I'd have 16 boobs,

70
00:04:39,193 --> 00:04:41,568
which would mean my lingerie bill would be through the roof.

71
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,268
I'm canceling classes and sending everyone home.

72
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,338
In the meantime, find out who did this.

73
00:04:47,445 --> 00:04:49,963
...Regular, futuristic kids...

74
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:54,401
So you want to know what things were like 50 years ago?

75
00:04:54,504 --> 00:04:56,231
Well, the truth is,

76
00:04:56,402 --> 00:05:01,820
there's not a single person in this place worth remembering in 50 years.

77
00:05:01,939 --> 00:05:04,526
So don't believe any of the other crap you're hearing.

78
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:07,384
Everyone at Tree Hill High is a liar.

79
00:05:07,491 --> 00:05:11,209
Like, I'm sure Russ Lahodnie, our all-american wrestler,

80
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:15,040
who everybody thinks is this nice, respectable guy...

81
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:16,680
I bet he forgot to mention the fact

82
00:05:16,762 --> 00:05:20,264
that he's the king of slipping girls the date-rape drug.

83
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:23,097
Or miss perfect 4.0 Katie Radison?

84
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:26,799
Yeah, three words -- gang bang, abortion.

85
00:05:27,949 --> 00:05:32,620
See, people in here are fake, so they stick to their cliques to hide it.

86
00:05:32,743 --> 00:05:34,883
The stoners are medicated,

87
00:05:34,985 --> 00:05:37,918
the honor students are afraid, and the jocks...

88
00:05:38,033 --> 00:05:41,064
Whoa. They're jocks, man.

89
00:05:41,168 --> 00:05:47,312
They'll peak at 17, and their cheerleader girlfriends will be fat and lonely by 21.

90
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:48,893
L osers.

91
00:05:50,007 --> 00:05:52,710
Everyone here is a loser.

92
00:05:53,099 --> 00:05:54,964
And the truth is,

93
00:05:55,968 --> 00:05:58,724
every day I have to come to this school

94
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,789
is one less day I have to come back.

95
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:05,439
Attention, students, classes are canceled for the day.

96
00:06:05,559 --> 00:06:09,556
Please exit the school in a timely but orderly fashion.

97
00:06:09,601 --> 00:06:12,805
That would be a miracle, given how bad the teachers are at Tree Hill high.

98
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,283
They all say they care, but they don't.

99
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,620
Hey, Jim.

100
00:06:23,061 --> 00:06:23,992
Everything okay?

101
00:06:24,098 --> 00:06:27,657
You don't talk to me for a year, and now you want to be friends again?

102
00:06:27,756 --> 00:06:28,917
We just want to talk.

103
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:31,882
Well, forget it. You just heard everything I have to say.

104
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:38,864
There's probably great advances in plastic surgery,

105
00:06:38,957 --> 00:06:43,530
but  there really needs to be some sort of record of my body at its peak.

106
00:06:44,215 --> 00:06:45,196
Okay.

107
00:06:45,644 --> 00:06:48,223
We've got a good news/bad news situation here.

108
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:52,611
What could be worse than the whole school seeing your boobs?

109
00:06:53,638 --> 00:06:56,856
Actually, if you're aliens, you probably have eight sets of eyes, which means...

110
00:06:56,974 --> 00:06:59,026
The whole world seeing them?

111
00:06:59,772 --> 00:07:02,168
Yeah, whoever decided to unleash the time capsule

112
00:07:02,264 --> 00:07:05,059
was also nice enough to upload it onto the web.

113
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:07,402
Oh, my god, I'm internet porn?

114
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:10,164
Some creepy guy is watching me right now?

115
00:07:10,767 --> 00:07:12,566
Well, I'm guessing that's not all he's doing.

116
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:13,665
Ew.

117
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:15,932
What's the good news?

118
00:07:16,062 --> 00:07:18,500
You did rank number 23 on limewire.

119
00:07:18,601 --> 00:07:19,523
Really?

120
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:24,891
So  I'm seeing this girl, and our experience levels are a little different, you know?

121
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:29,308
But even so, I'm doing something with her that I've never done before.

122
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,063
I'm falling in love.

123
00:07:35,396 --> 00:07:37,942
I'm sorry, buddy. I know it's not easy to relive all this.

124
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:39,380
No, it's okay.

125
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:40,759
Seriously.

126
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,666
I'm not gonna have a Jake-down.

127
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:45,831
Yeah, but hearing you talk about how in love you guys were...

128
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:49,770
We were in love, and it was amazing, but...

129
00:07:50,248 --> 00:07:53,686
seeing it and hearing it again just makes you realize how happy I was.

130
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:55,794
You know, I want to be that happy again.

131
00:07:55,902 --> 00:08:01,328
I do, so I'm just gonna grow the hell up and focus on the good things in my life

132
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:04,788
and get ready for Ellie's benefit concert, right?

133
00:08:08,865 --> 00:08:10,048
Ta-da!

134
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,892
Oh, this is gonna be great.

135
00:08:11,986 --> 00:08:13,129
I hope so.

136
00:08:13,223 --> 00:08:15,454
Ticket sales haven't exactly been through the roof.

137
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,313
What are you worried about? You sold out the last Fall Out Boy show,

138
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,473
and this time you have Haley and Jack's Mannequin --

139
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,940
And more expensive benefit tickets.

140
00:08:23,032 --> 00:08:25,380
Okay, yes, I mean, we do have great bands,

141
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:28,364
and Sunkist is being awesome by underwriting the whole event,

142
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:34,031
but I'd really love to do something great for the National Breast Cancer Foundation.

143
00:08:34,146 --> 00:08:35,601
You know, it's for Ellie.

144
00:08:35,862 --> 00:08:36,720
Yeah.

145
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,565
Anyway, I just wish there was a way to get more people's attention.

146
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,192
Too bad I didn't put it on the time capsule. Then everybody would have seen it, right?

147
00:08:44,956 --> 00:08:47,590
How much do you love that your best friend's a genius?

148
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,438
Never mind.

149
00:08:49,903 --> 00:08:51,289
I know how to get the word out.

150
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:52,928
I just need to call Mouth. He can help.

151
00:08:53,026 --> 00:08:56,112
And after my whole senator comment on the time capsule, he's so thrilled with me,

152
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,296
I think he'd donate a kidney if I asked him to.

153
00:08:58,382 --> 00:09:02,040
Well, yeah, but it's not like it's the first time you've ever told him that.

154
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,162
What?

155
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:06,636
Yeah, he mentioned the whole senator thing when we went on our "boy draft" date.

156
00:09:07,614 --> 00:09:10,323
But I never told him about it, so...

157
00:09:11,293 --> 00:09:12,786
...how would he have known?

158
00:09:14,296 --> 00:09:20,995
Not to... change her mind or to tell her what to do, but...

159
00:09:23,303 --> 00:09:25,320
just to say I love you,

160
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:27,585
and I'll miss you.

161
00:09:29,563 --> 00:09:30,974
Just to say goodbye.

162
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:33,377
Great.

163
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,600
It's gone global.

164
00:09:35,338 --> 00:09:39,021
Yeah, well, at least now the whole world knows all the nice things you said about me --

165
00:09:39,192 --> 00:09:42,244
to go along with all the crappy things that Nathan said about me.

166
00:09:43,116 --> 00:09:46,096
Well, what did he say when you talked to him?

167
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:48,228
I haven't talked to him yet.

168
00:09:49,177 --> 00:09:51,860
I know. I just don't want to pry open old wounds.

169
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:54,452
Well, I think the time capsule did that for you.

170
00:09:54,556 --> 00:09:57,927
Which just really sucks because now I have to get up on stage and sing for this benefit.

171
00:09:58,018 --> 00:10:01,461
It's the worst time for all this stuff to blow up again.

172
00:10:03,852 --> 00:10:07,383
What'd you say to "hooter girl" when she made her topless debut?

173
00:10:09,869 --> 00:10:11,501
I told her she looked beautiful.

174
00:10:11,606 --> 00:10:13,118
Oh, god.

175
00:10:13,231 --> 00:10:16,393
Hey, you know what? If you get into trouble, just roll that one out.

176
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:18,442
Yeah, I'll remember that. Thanks.

177
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:21,841
Uh, Lucas, can we talk to you?

178
00:10:22,423 --> 00:10:23,358
Why?

179
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:26,695
Well, Keith and I have been doing some talking, and...

180
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:28,305
We're engaged.

181
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:29,551
What?!

182
00:10:30,325 --> 00:10:32,128
That's so awesome!

183
00:10:32,222 --> 00:10:33,751
Well, it's about time.

184
00:10:33,872 --> 00:10:37,406
Oh, my god! You guys are really engaged? That's so awesome!

185
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:38,897
Here's a little advice --

186
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:41,242
never get married.

187
00:10:41,377 --> 00:10:43,379
In the end, you'll only be miserable.

188
00:10:55,091 --> 00:10:58,576
Um... hi.

189
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:02,442
Listen, um... about the time capsule --

190
00:11:02,562 --> 00:11:04,073
Oh, you looked beautiful.

191
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:07,542
Okay, I guess you had to be there -- sorry.

192
00:11:07,649 --> 00:11:14,172
Um, listen, I just wanted to apologize for avoiding you, avoiding this.

193
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,141
I just really don't want to ruin how we've been lately with another fight.

194
00:11:19,021 --> 00:11:19,943
I know.

195
00:11:20,261 --> 00:11:23,713
And, look, I'm sorry about what I said on that stupid time capsule.

196
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,877
You weren't supposed to hear that.

197
00:11:26,036 --> 00:11:28,079
I mean, this you wasn't supposed to hear that,

198
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,814
not when things have been going so good for us, you know?

199
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,257
Yeah. Um, okay. So this is the thing --

200
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:37,113
we've had some really great nights together lately,

201
00:11:37,401 --> 00:11:38,668
really great.

202
00:11:39,209 --> 00:11:41,095
But you're still living alone in this big house,

203
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:43,555
and I'm still crammed in a one-bedroom with Brooke,

204
00:11:43,653 --> 00:11:45,684
and I just...

205
00:11:47,710 --> 00:11:49,478
I don't know -- I don't...

206
00:11:51,027 --> 00:11:53,935
maybe we're not doing as good as we think we are.

207
00:11:57,277 --> 00:11:59,961
Since you're the head of the media club,

208
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:04,756
and being as you're the president of the student council

209
00:12:04,871 --> 00:12:07,481
and all-around social butterfly,

210
00:12:07,966 --> 00:12:11,792
I thought the two of you might know who caused all this mess.

211
00:12:12,091 --> 00:12:14,098
Um, no idea, coach.

212
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:17,027
Classes check out the keys to the media closet all the time.

213
00:12:17,142 --> 00:12:18,459
Anybody could have done it.

214
00:12:18,562 --> 00:12:20,755
How about you, miss Davis? Any ideas?

215
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,230
Can't think of anybody right now.

216
00:12:31,386 --> 00:12:35,060
I mean, what kind of horrible person would pry open people's secrets

217
00:12:35,157 --> 00:12:37,355
by opening up the time capsule?

218
00:12:38,172 --> 00:12:39,163
Yeah.

219
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:41,749
Yeah.

220
00:12:42,098 --> 00:12:45,317
Hey, Peyton told me you're planning on running for senator?

221
00:12:45,405 --> 00:12:47,240
I think it's a good fit...

222
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,180
since most politicians are liars.

223
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:01,516
Is it too late for my mom to get engaged to a plumber?

224
00:13:02,046 --> 00:13:04,200
Better watch your smart remarks, pal.

225
00:13:04,509 --> 00:13:07,464
I think the engagement comes with full grounding privileges.

226
00:13:07,562 --> 00:13:08,537
Good to remember.

227
00:13:08,626 --> 00:13:10,786
But, seriously, you don't have to fix this.

228
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:13,699
The disposal's been broke for over a year. We're kind of used to it.

229
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:16,270
Yeah, well, it's never too late to try and fix things.

230
00:13:18,677 --> 00:13:21,477
So why don't you give me a hand, and tell me what's bothering you?

231
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:22,656
Well...

232
00:13:23,981 --> 00:13:25,284
you remember Jimmy Edwards?

233
00:13:26,048 --> 00:13:27,073
Yeah. Why?

234
00:13:27,579 --> 00:13:30,747
You know how the time-capsule thing got out?

235
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:34,660
His entry was... really dark.

236
00:13:34,834 --> 00:13:37,106
You know, he was just a completely different person.

237
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,701
He... just ranted about how much he hates everybody.

238
00:13:41,815 --> 00:13:44,633
Doesn't sound like the happy-go-lucky kid who used to come to the shop

239
00:13:44,727 --> 00:13:46,409
and quiz me on sports trivia.

240
00:13:46,671 --> 00:13:48,700
What do you think made him say those things?

241
00:13:49,058 --> 00:13:50,043
Me.

242
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,004
Maybe. I don't know.

243
00:13:53,203 --> 00:13:56,417
I haven't seen him since I... joined the basketball team.

244
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,307
We just kind of drifted apart.

245
00:13:59,433 --> 00:14:00,511
Well...

246
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,271
Voilà.

247
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:05,804
There, you see?

248
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,526
It's never too late to try and fix things.

249
00:14:10,203 --> 00:14:12,404
Speaking of, um...

250
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,111
I got a little proposition for you.

251
00:14:16,226 --> 00:14:18,333
It's kind of off the subject,

252
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:24,742
but I want you to understand that there is no wrong answer to this question, okay?

253
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:25,959
Okay.

254
00:14:27,008 --> 00:14:28,290
Okay, look.

255
00:14:30,377 --> 00:14:32,043
Well, you know I love you.

256
00:14:32,154 --> 00:14:36,038
Okay, Keith, I know that. What's up?

257
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:37,846
Well...

258
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:41,436
me and your mom talked it over, and...

259
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:44,137
well, if it's okay with you...

260
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,286
I'd like to adopt you.

261
00:14:47,941 --> 00:14:50,146
I want you to be my son.

262
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:56,533
Look, just sit with it for a while, and we'll talk about it later, okay?

263
00:14:56,648 --> 00:15:00,874
And, remember, there is no wrong answer.

264
00:15:02,697 --> 00:15:03,583
Okay.

265
00:15:11,385 --> 00:15:16,314
Okay, P. Sawyer, all of your concert woes are so one-trip-to-kinko's ago.

266
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:17,597
Oh, what are you talking about?

267
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,315
Are you hand-delivering me a sold-out crowd?

268
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,142
Sort of, but it's not gonna be my hands that deliver them.

269
00:15:30,518 --> 00:15:33,019
Brooke, you did all this?

270
00:15:33,148 --> 00:15:34,962
Me and a couple of horny freshmen.

271
00:15:35,085 --> 00:15:37,577
Never thought I'd be able to say this, but by the end of the day,

272
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,627
the whole town will have seen my breasts.

273
00:15:39,771 --> 00:15:41,674
Now my mom and I have something in common.

274
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,424
Have I told you lately you're my best friend?

275
00:15:59,534 --> 00:16:00,770
What do you want, Danny?

276
00:16:01,891 --> 00:16:03,232
Let's go for a drive.

277
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,542
What are you doing?

278
00:16:06,648 --> 00:16:09,423
Looking to see if you brought along a hacksaw and shovel.

279
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:12,698
There was a time you and I could talk, Keith.

280
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:16,037
Yeah, I think the last meaningful conversation we had was,

281
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:19,366
"who would win in a fight -- chewbacca or the six million dollar man?"

282
00:16:19,494 --> 00:16:20,644
Chewbacca.

283
00:16:20,917 --> 00:16:21,655
Let's go.

284
00:16:37,258 --> 00:16:38,559
I'm telling you, he'll be here.

285
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:40,510
- Hey.
- Hey -- whoa.

286
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:44,647
Sneaking up on us, Jim?

287
00:16:45,161 --> 00:16:47,938
Not hard to do when you're basically invisible.

288
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:50,637
Look, man, I'm glad you came.

289
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:52,560
Well, I almost didn't come, but...

290
00:16:52,673 --> 00:16:55,647
I figured it was the only way to get you guys not to call my house.

291
00:16:55,738 --> 00:16:59,899
You don't call for a year and then suddenly it's five times in a day.

292
00:17:00,123 --> 00:17:01,622
What's up with that?

293
00:17:02,216 --> 00:17:05,609
Look, it sucks that we lost touch, okay?

294
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:09,497
And a lot of that's on us, but it is a two-way street.

295
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:11,519
You  know, our phones didn't ring, either.

296
00:17:12,771 --> 00:17:14,060
Wow.

297
00:17:14,837 --> 00:17:16,685
I forgot how much fun this was.

298
00:17:16,779 --> 00:17:17,792
I'm  sorry I came.

299
00:17:17,897 --> 00:17:18,873
Come on, Jimmy.

300
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:20,768
He speaks.

301
00:17:21,526 --> 00:17:22,804
What have you got, Mouth?

302
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:25,906
What  words are going to make up for a year of being left behind,

303
00:17:26,014 --> 00:17:28,236
a year of being forgotten about?

304
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,553
How about "I'm sorry"?

305
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:33,764
It sucks, but it's a start.

306
00:17:33,868 --> 00:17:35,420
Look, Jim, you want a long, drawn-out explanation

307
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,392
for why things went down the way they did?

308
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:39,455
I can probably find one for you, okay?

309
00:17:39,555 --> 00:17:41,848
But we're here now.

310
00:17:42,054 --> 00:17:44,927
We want to make up for lost time.

311
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:47,055
You know, we don't want to lose any more.

312
00:17:48,964 --> 00:17:52,232
There's a concert tonight, this cancer-benefit thing.

313
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:54,128
We want you to come with us.

314
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:57,842
I can't show my face around those people,

315
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,462
not after the way I went off on the time capsule.

316
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,101
Dude, everybody went off.

317
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:04,883
Some even took things off.

318
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,916
Look, you know what? Mouth's right, man.

319
00:18:09,036 --> 00:18:11,940
They're not worried about what you said. They're worried about what they said.

320
00:18:12,036 --> 00:18:13,157
Come on.

321
00:18:14,585 --> 00:18:16,214
Look, just say yes.

322
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:21,231
Whatever. But if it's lame, I'm leaving.

323
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:22,521
All right.

324
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:24,479
Come on, man.

325
00:18:27,512 --> 00:18:29,546
All right, so what are we doing here, Danny?

326
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:32,321
Do you remember what happened here when we were kids?

327
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:40,424
Well, I remember I got to first base with Abby Hosford underneath that tree over there.

328
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:42,726
I was thinking a little further back.

329
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:44,267
I'll give you a hint.

330
00:18:45,446 --> 00:18:47,121
The Dunlap brothers.

331
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:55,282
Danny Scott's lunch.

332
00:18:55,411 --> 00:18:57,373
No wonder you fight like a girl.

333
00:18:57,491 --> 00:18:59,192
Your mom sure feeds you like one!

334
00:18:59,323 --> 00:19:00,970
Now eat it, "Dan-iella"!

335
00:19:01,101 --> 00:19:02,964
Eat it, or we'll make you eat it!

336
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,274
You first!

337
00:19:09,609 --> 00:19:10,905
That's what I thought.

338
00:19:11,363 --> 00:19:12,309
Come on.

339
00:19:13,272 --> 00:19:14,158
Thanks.

340
00:19:15,308 --> 00:19:16,546
That's what brothers do.

341
00:19:16,645 --> 00:19:18,069
They look out for each other.

342
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:26,578
It's like those guys read a handbook on bullying.

343
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:29,023
Picking fights, stealing lunches...

344
00:19:29,415 --> 00:19:32,987
but you stood them down, right here in this park, every other time they got into it.

345
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:35,902
Yep, then you got bigger than all of us, didn't you?

346
00:19:36,703 --> 00:19:39,079
Back then, I knew, no matter what,

347
00:19:39,206 --> 00:19:41,215
you and I would always stick together.

348
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,028
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago, Danny.

349
00:19:46,137 --> 00:19:47,036
I know.

350
00:19:49,941 --> 00:19:52,128
Think how far things have fallen for us.

351
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,615
What do you think makes two brothers become such bitter enemies?

352
00:19:57,483 --> 00:19:58,428
You?

353
00:19:59,933 --> 00:20:01,458
You're probably right.

354
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,830
I'll tell you what --

355
00:20:04,727 --> 00:20:06,276
let me make it up to you.

356
00:20:09,369 --> 00:20:10,741
What is this, Danny?

357
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:18,340
This is how far things have come between you and me.

358
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,230
I put that ledger in the safe before the dealership burned.

359
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:23,444
Only two things came out of that fire --

360
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:24,957
that ledger and me.

361
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,053
And I know you didn't pull me out.

362
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,207
I guess you had your hands full with the ledger.

363
00:20:29,308 --> 00:20:31,918
Well, one, anyway, since the other was holding on to a zippo.

364
00:20:32,016 --> 00:20:33,067
Is that what you think?

365
00:20:33,168 --> 00:20:36,458
No, big brother, that's what I know.

366
00:20:36,667 --> 00:20:38,971
You're holding on to the smoking gun.

367
00:20:39,824 --> 00:20:43,195
Well... don't forget what this is, Danny.

368
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:46,494
This is the key to your jail cell.

369
00:20:46,616 --> 00:20:49,905
This ties you to years of money laundering,

370
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,343
fraud, and embezzlement.

371
00:20:52,465 --> 00:20:54,976
You see, that's the thing about a smoking gun, Dan --

372
00:20:55,082 --> 00:20:57,186
it doesn't care who it's pointing at.

373
00:20:59,873 --> 00:21:01,186
Look at you.

374
00:21:02,015 --> 00:21:04,413
Still carrying around all this hate,

375
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:06,824
just like you've been carrying around this ledger.

376
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:09,137
Well, if you don't want to go to jail...

377
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:12,702
you better get rid of them both.

378
00:21:16,227 --> 00:21:18,419
I'm marrying Karen, Dan.

379
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:20,999
I'm moving on.

380
00:21:21,717 --> 00:21:23,076
You should, too.

381
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:29,226
I'll find my own way home.

382
00:21:41,503 --> 00:21:43,118
Get out!

383
00:21:43,384 --> 00:21:44,601
But this is my club.

384
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:46,628
You and Keith are engaged?

385
00:21:46,718 --> 00:21:48,310
Wait, are you pregnant? No, of course not.

386
00:21:48,408 --> 00:21:52,418
Getting pregnant twice outside of marriage would make you... totally awesome!

387
00:21:52,515 --> 00:21:55,388
Um, I think that's Brooke for "congratulations."

388
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:58,306
I'm sorry. Let me make it up to you.

389
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,562
You have to let me make your wedding dress.

390
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:02,809
Please, please, please. I love weddings.

391
00:22:02,933 --> 00:22:05,416
Yeah, um, just promise me that it'll be something more

392
00:22:05,494 --> 00:22:06,630
than what you're wearing on the poster.

393
00:22:06,722 --> 00:22:07,184
Yes.

394
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:08,856
- And no feathers.
- No.

395
00:22:18,702 --> 00:22:19,635
Oh, hey.

396
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:20,938
How you holding up?

397
00:22:21,346 --> 00:22:24,612
I'm good. Just a few butterflies.

398
00:22:24,723 --> 00:22:25,654
Good.

399
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:29,090
When I say butterflies, I mean, like, giant things the size of Mothra

400
00:22:29,142 --> 00:22:31,109
or whatever Godzilla fought.

401
00:22:31,418 --> 00:22:32,785
Well, you'll be okay.

402
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,984
I got you these for good luck.

403
00:22:37,471 --> 00:22:39,427
You know, we should find out what those flowers are called

404
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,306
and order some seeds or something.

405
00:22:41,488 --> 00:22:44,805
At the rate I've been screwing up, there's not gonna be any left to pick.

406
00:22:47,154 --> 00:22:48,261
Come here.

407
00:22:50,688 --> 00:22:54,103
I'm so proud of you, and I love you.

408
00:22:54,834 --> 00:22:57,236
You'll be great out there, okay?

409
00:22:57,647 --> 00:22:59,407
You got nothing to worry about.

410
00:23:06,729 --> 00:23:08,290
Except us.

411
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:12,598
Hey, what's up, Tree Hill? How are you guys?

412
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:16,053
First off, I really want to thank you guys for coming out tonight.

413
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:20,336
Some of you may know Ellie Harp recently succumbed to breast cancer,

414
00:23:20,427 --> 00:23:24,174
so tonight, we remember her life by trying to save many lives,

415
00:23:24,267 --> 00:23:27,084
because, for every ticket you guys have purchased,

416
00:23:27,194 --> 00:23:31,366
you all are helping the National Breast Cancer Foundation in their fight against cancer,

417
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:33,378
so give it up for yourselves.

418
00:23:33,863 --> 00:23:34,610
Thank you.

419
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:39,219
And also give it up for Sunkist, who helped make all this happen tonight.

420
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:44,204
All right, now, you guys, this next performer had leukemia,

421
00:23:44,294 --> 00:23:47,377
he fought leukemia, and he kicked leukemia's ass,

422
00:23:47,465 --> 00:23:49,332
and tonight he is here to kick yours.

423
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:53,607
Please give it up for Andrew McMahon and Jack's Mannequin.

424
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,683
You did good, Peyton. Both your moms would be proud of you.

425
00:26:02,402 --> 00:26:06,017
Wow. Backstage -- how great is this, man, huh?

426
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,868
Look, I'm going to go see if I can find Haley, okay?

427
00:26:07,905 --> 00:26:08,932
- Okay.
- All right.

428
00:26:11,061 --> 00:26:12,363
This is cool.

429
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:20,208
Hey, um, I need to talk to Brooke for a second, okay?

430
00:26:20,448 --> 00:26:21,356
You sure?

431
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:23,647
- Yeah, man, go.
- Great.

432
00:26:24,678 --> 00:26:26,807
I'm sure you'll introduce me later.

433
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:31,860
Brooke, you can't possibly think I could release the time capsule,

434
00:26:31,951 --> 00:26:33,837
that I'd smash out the cornerstone?

435
00:26:33,927 --> 00:26:36,048
Maybe you pretended it was my windshield.

436
00:26:36,494 --> 00:26:37,966
All right, here's the thing.

437
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:41,547
Yes, I saw the time capsule before it was broadcast all over school,

438
00:26:41,644 --> 00:26:44,058
but I was only trying to do it to help someone out,

439
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:46,295
someone who wanted to erase something they'd said on it.

440
00:26:46,318 --> 00:26:46,979
Who?

441
00:26:47,076 --> 00:26:48,179
I can't say.

442
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:49,370
I swore I'd keep it a secret.

443
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:51,669
And the time capsule wasn't supposed to be a secret?

444
00:26:51,762 --> 00:26:52,815
Brooke, I made a promise.

445
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:58,114
Okay. Let's say you did just go in to try to save somebody from something they said.

446
00:26:58,210 --> 00:27:00,866
What does that have to do with my recording?

447
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,802
Why did you have to watch my time capsule?

448
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:07,367
That's what I thought.

449
00:27:07,552 --> 00:27:10,456
Brooke, I didn't watch enough of it to know that you took your clothes off.

450
00:27:10,543 --> 00:27:11,523
I didn't see anything.

451
00:27:11,624 --> 00:27:13,500
You think that's what I'm upset about?

452
00:27:13,607 --> 00:27:16,173
Mouth, there were private things on there.

453
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:18,639
You violated a trust.

454
00:27:18,755 --> 00:27:20,992
You violated a friendship.

455
00:27:23,161 --> 00:27:25,262
I guess I was wrong about what I said on the time capsule.

456
00:27:25,346 --> 00:27:28,055
You're not the guy I thought you'd be in 20 years.

457
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:39,573
Oh, my god!

458
00:27:39,879 --> 00:27:41,922
Did you just get backstage?

459
00:27:42,017 --> 00:27:43,874
Who's all back there? Oh, my god.

460
00:27:43,987 --> 00:27:45,571
Do you think you could get me in?

461
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:47,380
Um, I don't know. I could try.

462
00:27:47,427 --> 00:27:48,399
Hey!

463
00:27:48,547 --> 00:27:49,954
Don't talk to him.

464
00:27:51,773 --> 00:27:54,780
That's the guy that was talking all that smack about me on the time capsule.

465
00:27:54,868 --> 00:27:56,317
Look, Russ, I'm really sorry --

466
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,665
Stay out of it!

467
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,404
Hey!

468
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,219
Are you all right?

469
00:28:44,164 --> 00:28:45,311
Leave me alone!

470
00:28:47,153 --> 00:28:48,327
Just forget about it.

471
00:28:49,389 --> 00:28:51,014
And forget about me.

472
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,311
You know who's up next?

473
00:29:15,414 --> 00:29:16,381
Fall Out Boy.

474
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,943
Yeah, I heard that band sucks,

475
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:19,596
but the bass player's pretty cool.

476
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:21,596
Hi, Pete.

477
00:29:22,005 --> 00:29:24,749
Hey, I can't thank you and the band enough for being here.

478
00:29:24,853 --> 00:29:28,449
It's no big deal, but thanks, and we wouldn't have missed it for the world.

479
00:29:28,541 --> 00:29:32,078
You know, it's a great cause, and I get to see you again.

480
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:33,748
Yeah.

481
00:29:33,861 --> 00:29:37,487
So, be right back. I'm gonna go save the world.

482
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,773
Did he just roll out, "got to go save the world"?

483
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:43,622
Yeah.

484
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,002
That's my line.

485
00:29:47,963 --> 00:29:50,063
What's up, Tree Hill? We're fall Out Boy,

486
00:29:50,158 --> 00:29:53,425
and we love your breasts, so make sure you take care of them.

487
00:30:46,239 --> 00:30:47,038
Hey, Brooke.

488
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:48,521
Don't "hey, Brooke" me.

489
00:30:48,628 --> 00:30:50,599
What is up with you and Hottie McHottie?

490
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:51,700
Who McWhat?

491
00:30:51,791 --> 00:30:53,143
Don't even try it.

492
00:30:53,244 --> 00:30:54,953
Please, the Fall Out Boy?

493
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:58,877
I can spot hitting-on-you from a mile away, and you were definitely returning fire.

494
00:30:58,978 --> 00:31:00,485
We talked for like 10 seconds.

495
00:31:00,593 --> 00:31:02,282
So you move fast.

496
00:31:02,369 --> 00:31:03,840
You should ask him to check you for lumps.

497
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:04,939
Okay, not funny.

498
00:31:05,034 --> 00:31:07,998
What? He's a musician. He's got to have good hands.

499
00:31:14,745 --> 00:31:15,580
Great.

500
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:25,114
Damn it!

501
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:36,084
You're the one with the pepper spray, right?

502
00:31:37,394 --> 00:31:39,036
Thanks for helping me out.

503
00:31:40,674 --> 00:31:42,469
To be honest, it really wasn't about you.

504
00:31:42,573 --> 00:31:45,470
I've just always wanted to pepper-spray someone.

505
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:55,650
Took one to the jaw, huh?

506
00:31:56,129 --> 00:31:58,651
Yeah, it wasn't one. It was three.

507
00:32:00,677 --> 00:32:02,021
Any idea where Edwards went?

508
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:04,124
No, I'm gonna see if I can find him.

509
00:32:04,349 --> 00:32:05,571
Well, I'll come with you.

510
00:32:05,678 --> 00:32:06,860
No, let me go alone.

511
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,348
Might be better one-on-one.

512
00:32:08,453 --> 00:32:09,590
All right.

513
00:32:12,111 --> 00:32:15,165
You think we'll ever have a function in this town that doesn't end up in a brawl?

514
00:32:15,265 --> 00:32:17,766
Why, getting a little too "outsiders" for you?

515
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:19,103
I never saw it.

516
00:32:19,219 --> 00:32:21,810
Well, you would have been one of the bad guys.

517
00:32:21,926 --> 00:32:23,001
Oh, okay.

518
00:32:25,904 --> 00:32:28,712
About what I said in the time capsule about Dan...

519
00:32:28,827 --> 00:32:30,023
Whatever, man.

520
00:32:30,788 --> 00:32:31,831
We're cool.

521
00:32:44,661 --> 00:32:45,800
Haley?

522
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:50,571
Oh, hey. Under... here.

523
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,699
What the hell are you doing?

524
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:53,887
You know, just hanging out under the vanity,

525
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:56,228
singing the finale to "Les Mis."

526
00:32:56,501 --> 00:32:58,916
Right before the first time I had to play on tour,

527
00:32:59,008 --> 00:33:01,419
I got really nervous, and so I ended up hiding under a desk,

528
00:33:01,522 --> 00:33:03,564
and I just sang that song over and over again.

529
00:33:03,672 --> 00:33:06,130
It was kind of the only thing that would calm me down. So I...

530
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:08,405
What -- you don't have any pregame rituals?

531
00:33:08,494 --> 00:33:10,243
No. What are you worried about?

532
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:11,773
I mean, you got the home-court advantage.

533
00:33:11,862 --> 00:33:13,635
You've played in front of this many people before.

534
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:16,722
I know. I'm not worried about playing in front of hundreds of people.

535
00:33:16,772 --> 00:33:18,512
That, I could do it in my sleep.

536
00:33:19,045 --> 00:33:23,373
I'm scared of playing in front of one in particular.

537
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:28,999
This is my first time playing out since the tour,

538
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:32,373
and it's my first time playing since you and I have been us again.

539
00:33:32,475 --> 00:33:34,860
Then I saw your time capsule, and I just got scared.

540
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,177
Of what?

541
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:39,955
Loving it again, of you seeing me love it again.

542
00:33:40,054 --> 00:33:45,448
I just... I'm afraid that you're gonna think that it somehow means that I love you less.

543
00:33:46,749 --> 00:33:48,244
They're ready for you, miss Scott.

544
00:33:48,344 --> 00:33:50,214
Thanks -- Mrs. Scott.

545
00:33:51,563 --> 00:33:53,650
Oh. Sorry.

546
00:33:55,824 --> 00:33:57,348
Well, that was my cue.

547
00:34:02,196 --> 00:34:04,464
Don't be afraid to love it, Haley.

548
00:34:05,441 --> 00:34:06,334
All right?

549
00:34:06,948 --> 00:34:08,124
Okay.

550
00:34:09,131 --> 00:34:10,073
Hey.

551
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,236
Sorry -- pregame ritual.

552
00:34:12,349 --> 00:34:13,722
Yeah, I bet.

553
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:46,786
Great song, huh?

554
00:35:46,837 --> 00:35:47,822
Yeah.

555
00:35:48,191 --> 00:35:50,266
You're Haley's husband, right?

556
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,691
Yeah.

557
00:35:52,077 --> 00:35:53,981
I'm Dallas, Epic Records.

558
00:35:54,225 --> 00:35:55,671
She's talented.

559
00:35:55,769 --> 00:35:57,408
I got to be honest, though.

560
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,909
It's a shame she's not touring.

561
00:36:00,841 --> 00:36:03,234
She must really love you.

562
00:36:18,095 --> 00:36:19,783
Mom, Keith -- you got a second?

563
00:36:19,901 --> 00:36:21,117
Sure.

564
00:36:22,976 --> 00:36:26,118
Or should I say "mom and dad"?

565
00:36:30,296 --> 00:36:32,047
I would love to be your son, Keith.

566
00:36:36,658 --> 00:36:38,277
There's nothing else I'd want more.

567
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:52,203
Hey, Jimmy, I'm trying to find you. Where are you?

568
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,797
Call me when you get this.

569
00:36:57,053 --> 00:36:58,345
Are you coming back in?

570
00:36:58,460 --> 00:36:59,977
I got to find my friend.

571
00:37:00,107 --> 00:37:01,085
Why?

572
00:37:01,685 --> 00:37:03,175
Because he's my friend.

573
00:37:03,267 --> 00:37:06,459
You know, Mouth, that guy's either gonna stand on his own two feet

574
00:37:06,548 --> 00:37:07,998
or he's gonna fall,

575
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:10,116
but he has to do it on his own.

576
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:12,797
That's the scary truth, Mouth.

577
00:37:12,936 --> 00:37:14,324
We're all alone.

578
00:37:14,747 --> 00:37:16,281
Not if we have friends.

579
00:37:16,395 --> 00:37:17,903
But he doesn't.

580
00:37:18,627 --> 00:37:20,079
And if you're honest with yourself,

581
00:37:20,164 --> 00:37:22,819
you know there's a reason you don't hang out with him anymore.

582
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:24,221
And why is that?

583
00:37:24,333 --> 00:37:25,801
Because you hang out with me

584
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:28,244
or Brooke or Lucas.

585
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:30,292
Everybody can't be popular,

586
00:37:30,398 --> 00:37:33,643
because if they were, nobody would be popular.

587
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:36,486
I wish this time capsule had never been opened.

588
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:39,509
All it's done is cause people pain.

589
00:37:39,771 --> 00:37:41,476
The truth usually does.

590
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,792
How awesome was my girl?

591
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,230
Hey! Thanks.

592
00:37:59,379 --> 00:38:01,324
Look, I have a confession to make.

593
00:38:02,977 --> 00:38:04,064
I'm scared.

594
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,158
I didn't want to say anything to you because I know how much this means to you.

595
00:38:08,182 --> 00:38:10,657
And you deserve to have nights like this, but...

596
00:38:12,138 --> 00:38:15,154
the truth is, I'm afraid to go through all that again.

597
00:38:15,307 --> 00:38:17,737
Nathan, I can walk away from the music, you know?

598
00:38:17,838 --> 00:38:19,996
No, it's not the music, Hales. It's the rest of it.

599
00:38:20,071 --> 00:38:24,824
I'm -- I'm afraid to be vulnerable again with you.

600
00:38:26,661 --> 00:38:29,099
Look, I just don't want to be the guy on that time capsule --

601
00:38:29,168 --> 00:38:31,761
not now and not 50 years from now.

602
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:34,907
Hey.

603
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,610
It doesn't mean that I don't love you...

604
00:38:39,757 --> 00:38:41,070
because I do.

605
00:38:43,824 --> 00:38:46,178
You know, if I had recorded a time capsule,

606
00:38:46,286 --> 00:38:48,767
there wouldn't have been one word in there about music.

607
00:38:48,887 --> 00:38:51,295
It all would have been about us.

608
00:38:52,159 --> 00:38:53,662
I'm sure of it.

609
00:38:53,867 --> 00:38:56,252
Just like I'm sure that I love you.

610
00:38:56,354 --> 00:38:57,840
And I guess...

611
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:01,478
the rest we can figure out later.

612
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,765
They need you for the encore, Mrs. Scott.

613
00:39:10,558 --> 00:39:12,499
Ugh, okay.

614
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:21,208
Just promise me that this time, you'll be here when I get back.

615
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:38,563
It's been 50 years...

616
00:39:38,946 --> 00:39:41,958
50 long years...

617
00:39:42,286 --> 00:39:44,195
since I've done this.

618
00:39:44,805 --> 00:39:47,928
Looking back on what I said all those years ago,

619
00:39:48,015 --> 00:39:50,392
all the hopes and dreams I had...

620
00:39:51,883 --> 00:39:54,564
I've come to the conclusion that,

621
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,584
if having things turn out the way you wanted them to

622
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:02,117
is a measure of a successful life...

623
00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:06,374
then some would say I'm a failure.

624
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:12,644
The important thing is

625
00:40:13,838 --> 00:40:17,542
not to be bitter over life's disappointments.

626
00:40:20,349 --> 00:40:23,806
Learn to let go of the past.

627
00:40:37,459 --> 00:40:42,222
And recognize that every day won't be sunny.

628
00:40:42,391 --> 00:40:47,073
And when you find yourself lost in the darkness of despair...

629
00:41:04,867 --> 00:41:11,024
...remember that it's only in the black of night that you can see the stars,

630
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:15,455
and those stars will lead you back home.

631
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:20,977
So don't be afraid to make mistakes, to stumble and fall,

632
00:41:21,063 --> 00:41:23,038
because most of the time,

633
00:41:23,252 --> 00:41:27,908
the greatest rewards come from doing the things that scare you the most.

634
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:34,299
Maybe you'll get everything you wish for.

635
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:42,357
Maybe you'll get more than you ever could have imagined.

636
00:41:46,285 --> 00:41:48,763
Who knows where life will take you?

637
00:41:48,882 --> 00:41:51,955
The road is long, and in the end,

638
00:41:54,707 --> 00:41:57,460
the journey is the destination.
