1
00:00:00,217 --> 00:00:01,483
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,567 --> 00:00:03,326
Is everybody ready?!

3
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:04,408
Let me hear you!

4
00:00:04,506 --> 00:00:09,580
Five, four, three, two, one!

5
00:00:09,678 --> 00:00:11,712
Let the madness begin!

6
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:14,866
When I find out who did this to me,

7
00:00:14,953 --> 00:00:17,799
the sins I commit then could turn this place to rubble.

8
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,869
Can you see my ass through this?

9
00:00:23,078 --> 00:00:24,761
One of these nights, you're gonna realize it.

10
00:00:26,285 --> 00:00:28,245
I'm the guy for you, Brooke Davis.

11
00:00:29,521 --> 00:00:30,399
You'll see.

12
00:00:38,411 --> 00:00:41,037
I wanted you to fight for me.

13
00:00:41,136 --> 00:00:42,638
How was I supposed to know that?

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,886
You just are.

15
00:00:44,001 --> 00:00:45,004
I have cancer.

16
00:00:45,152 --> 00:00:46,650
Your other mom should be dead soon.

17
00:00:46,775 --> 00:00:47,845
You really are a bitch.

18
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:49,701
I'm not the one that sent Ellie away.

19
00:01:00,786 --> 00:01:02,587
You tell Haley that song was a hit.

20
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:15,411
What, what?

21
00:01:20,341 --> 00:01:21,532
How are things with Nathan?

22
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,505
If you think I'm gonna let you mistreat Haley, you're wrong.

23
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:26,866
'Cause if you do, I'm gonna hurt you.

24
00:01:27,027 --> 00:01:28,258
The roots are still there.

25
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:29,494
It just takes time.

26
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,794
Stay with me tonight.

27
00:01:30,987 --> 00:01:33,078
Oh, I was hoping you would say that.

28
00:01:35,258 --> 00:01:35,929
Yummy.

29
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,378
You're in the wrong store.

30
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,267
You're looking for slut barn.

31
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:41,890
So, you two bury the hatchet yet?

32
00:01:42,015 --> 00:01:44,197
Funny thing. I'm about to bury it in her throat.

33
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:48,164
If I wanted to watch cheerleaders wrestle, I'd turn on pay-per-view.

34
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,163
Nice.

35
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:53,014
This kind of turns me on.

36
00:01:54,418 --> 00:01:55,773
Fantasy boy draft.

37
00:01:55,894 --> 00:01:57,616
- I pick Lucas.
- I pick Nathan.

38
00:01:57,706 --> 00:01:58,849
- I get skills.
- Wait!

39
00:01:58,942 --> 00:02:02,017
If you tell Whitey I have a heart condition, I'm off the team.

40
00:02:02,114 --> 00:02:04,548
Yeah, and if I don't tell Whitey about your heart condition,

41
00:02:04,656 --> 00:02:06,113
you're off the planet.

42
00:02:07,273 --> 00:02:08,212
I love you.

43
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:09,640
I still do love you.

44
00:02:09,747 --> 00:02:10,386
I love you.

45
00:02:10,474 --> 00:02:11,401
I love you.

46
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:12,755
I love you, too.

47
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,505
Okay, what the hell just happened?

48
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:17,785
Ida Scott Taylor once wrote,

49
00:03:17,927 --> 00:03:20,424
"Do not look back and grieve over the past,

50
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,811
for it is gone,

51
00:03:22,181 --> 00:03:25,272
and do not be troubled about the future, for it has yet to come.

52
00:03:27,222 --> 00:03:30,016
Live in the present, and make it so beautiful

53
00:03:30,112 --> 00:03:32,056
that it will be worth remembering."

54
00:03:52,671 --> 00:03:53,364
Hello?

55
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:56,406
Where are you?

56
00:03:58,794 --> 00:03:59,897
Okay. Okay.

57
00:04:07,325 --> 00:04:08,382
Hello.

58
00:04:12,951 --> 00:04:14,193
Yeah, no problem.

59
00:04:14,607 --> 00:04:15,741
I'll be right over.

60
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,345
I'm sorry, Brooke.

61
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:22,244
It was Peyton.

62
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:23,348
Peyton?

63
00:04:23,605 --> 00:04:28,140
As in my best friend and your ex-girlfriend Peyton?

64
00:04:31,571 --> 00:04:32,807
Something's up,

65
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,086
but we're together now, right?

66
00:04:35,196 --> 00:04:36,015
You and me.

67
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:39,224
That means everything to me.

68
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,423
We just have to trust each other this time.

69
00:04:43,624 --> 00:04:45,130
I know, you're right.

70
00:04:45,446 --> 00:04:47,475
Besides, I have things to do today.

71
00:04:48,196 --> 00:04:49,680
It's pretty exciting, actually.

72
00:04:49,761 --> 00:04:53,050
Mouth set up a website for me so I can sell my new clothing line,

73
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:55,031
and it goes live in about an hour.

74
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:58,581
So, I figure I should make some dresses in case anyone wants to buy one.

75
00:04:58,955 --> 00:05:00,201
That's really great.

76
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:02,313
I'm proud of you.

77
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:08,049
Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

78
00:05:08,151 --> 00:05:08,984
Okay.

79
00:05:12,511 --> 00:05:14,115
See you later, boyfriend.

80
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:17,959
What?

81
00:05:18,053 --> 00:05:18,965
Nothing.

82
00:05:19,291 --> 00:05:23,129
Just... feels good to hear you call me boyfriend.

83
00:05:24,127 --> 00:05:25,826
Feels good to say it.

84
00:05:43,503 --> 00:05:46,666
And we are live.

85
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,744
Nice.

86
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:09,558
Hi.

87
00:06:14,185 --> 00:06:15,092
Well, well.

88
00:06:16,309 --> 00:06:17,416
Where's the better half?

89
00:06:17,501 --> 00:06:18,572
I don't know.

90
00:06:21,856 --> 00:06:24,662
Oh, he always was the "love 'em and leave 'em" type.

91
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:25,715
Can  I help you with something?

92
00:06:25,795 --> 00:06:28,358
As far as I know, this house doesn't belong to you anymore.

93
00:06:28,579 --> 00:06:32,390
Trust me, little girl, this house and everything in it will always belong to me.

94
00:06:34,675 --> 00:06:37,841
Mr. Scott, can you please leave? You're really creeping me out.

95
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:42,017
You know, at least Peyton was pleasant in the morning.

96
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,206
Oh, by the way, I'm still waiting on those annulment papers.

97
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,807
I hope you don't think a one-night stand's gonna change that.

98
00:07:03,008 --> 00:07:03,961
Hey.

99
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:08,773
Looks like somebody slept in his clothes last night.

100
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:11,674
Yeah, it's a long story.

101
00:07:11,775 --> 00:07:12,679
So what's going on?

102
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:15,844
Um, look, I hate to ask, okay?

103
00:07:15,944 --> 00:07:20,423
But over the summer, you kind of promised that if I ever wanted to go find Ellie,

104
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:21,963
you would come with me.

105
00:07:23,512 --> 00:07:25,032
Yeah, I remember.

106
00:07:25,215 --> 00:07:26,417
Did you find her?

107
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,324
And I think I want to go see her.

108
00:07:30,744 --> 00:07:31,482
Today?

109
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:36,655
Um, right now, actually, 'cause if I don't go, I never will, and I need to.

110
00:07:37,269 --> 00:07:38,322
Will you go?

111
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:42,226
Sure.

112
00:07:43,443 --> 00:07:45,054
A promise is a promise.

113
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:53,512
Hello.

114
00:07:55,278 --> 00:07:56,740
Hey, I'm on my way.

115
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:59,358
Okay. Good. I can give you directions.

116
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:07,026
Okay, where am I going?

117
00:08:09,224 --> 00:08:10,613
Where were you last night?

118
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:12,205
Oh, uh...

119
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:13,745
To  be continued.

120
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:16,982
Mouth, you didn't exactly break any speed records driving over here, you know?

121
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:20,853
You called me 17 minutes ago, and I drive a bicycle, Brooke.

122
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:25,157
Just please come here because I need you to fix this stupid website.

123
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:26,410
It was supposed to go live an hour ago.

124
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:27,463
Oh, it's live.

125
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:28,523
So what's the problem?

126
00:08:28,616 --> 00:08:29,699
Click on "orders."

127
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:32,679
34 orders? Brooke, this is great.

128
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:34,944
Hold the enthusiasm. Click it again.

129
00:08:35,727 --> 00:08:37,514
Make that 36 orders.

130
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,612
Brooke, 36 orders is incredible.

131
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,672
Haley, I can't make 36 dresses that fast.

132
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:43,824
I can't make 6 dresses that fast.

133
00:08:43,913 --> 00:08:45,906
Wait, what did you think was gonna happen?

134
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,060
I don't know. I didn't think people were actually gonna order anything,

135
00:08:48,139 --> 00:08:50,449
and if they did, I figured they'd just order stuff I'd already made.

136
00:08:50,537 --> 00:08:51,455
Was that a bad plan?

137
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,804
37, 38.

138
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:56,144
Dude, it just jumped to 43.

139
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,450
Mouth, I did not ask you to come over here to showcase your counting skills.

140
00:08:58,546 --> 00:09:01,146
I need you to make it stop. Kill it. Do whatever you have to do.

141
00:09:01,229 --> 00:09:03,163
I don't have 43 dresses.

142
00:09:03,255 --> 00:09:04,570
How many do you have?

143
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:06,326
4.

144
00:09:13,701 --> 00:09:14,909
So where are we headed?

145
00:09:15,021 --> 00:09:16,067
River city.

146
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:17,368
You ever been there?

147
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:20,855
No, but it's on my list.

148
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:23,173
So how about that long story?

149
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:25,848
I spent the night with Brooke.

150
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,605
Ugh. Okay. Never mind.

151
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:30,380
It wasn't like that.

152
00:09:30,492 --> 00:09:33,017
I mean, we didn't actually sleep together.

153
00:09:33,131 --> 00:09:37,208
I just thought you decided not to play her non-exclusive sleeping game.

154
00:09:37,307 --> 00:09:39,660
We're together now... exclusively.

155
00:09:41,545 --> 00:09:44,314
Oh, no. Oh, god, I am an idiot.

156
00:09:44,391 --> 00:09:46,182
No, you know what? Scratch that. You're an idiot.

157
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:47,787
I didn't know any better.

158
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,632
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:48,723 --> 00:09:53,243
Lucas, you guys have been together a couple of hours, and you're in the car with me?

160
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,871
Why didn't you tell me? I wouldn't have even asked you to come.

161
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,573
Peyton, I made you a promise.

162
00:09:59,395 --> 00:10:02,386
Besides, you should be able to turn to me for help.

163
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:04,113
I love being that guy for you.

164
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:06,717
Well, does Brooke love you being that guy for me?

165
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,699
No, I didn't think so. So, call her.

166
00:10:10,827 --> 00:10:13,806
Call her and tell her we had plans right now.

167
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:15,158
Dial the phone.

168
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,489
I got it. Just get the phone.

169
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,665
Thank god it is you. Please tell me you are on your way over here.

170
00:10:27,898 --> 00:10:30,645
Actually, I was just checking in to see how things are going.

171
00:10:30,748 --> 00:10:31,882
Like crap.

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,336
Are you still with Peyton?

173
00:10:35,786 --> 00:10:39,687
Yeah, listen, I sort of promised her I'd go with her to see Ellie,

174
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:41,707
and we're heading out of town right now.

175
00:10:42,853 --> 00:10:44,683
How long are you gonna be gone?

176
00:10:44,782 --> 00:10:46,892
I don't know, but I'll call you when I do.

177
00:10:48,037 --> 00:10:48,811
Okay.

178
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:50,683
Look, Brooke, I made her a promise.

179
00:10:50,783 --> 00:10:54,306
Luke, it's fine. We're trusting each other, right?

180
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,620
So just call me later, okay?

181
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,650
See ya.

182
00:10:57,787 --> 00:10:58,630
Okay.

183
00:11:02,082 --> 00:11:03,912
See?  She's fine with it.

184
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:11,516
Hey, was that Lucas? Is he coming over? 'Cause we need all the help we can get.

185
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,579
No, he's with his other girlfriend.

186
00:11:28,983 --> 00:11:30,133
This is it.

187
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:34,551
You okay?

188
00:11:35,232 --> 00:11:36,037
Yeah.

189
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,753
I guess I just didn't think I'd be this afraid.

190
00:11:38,862 --> 00:11:39,852
Of what?

191
00:11:40,171 --> 00:11:43,036
I don't know. The truth maybe?

192
00:11:45,407 --> 00:11:46,144
You know what?

193
00:11:46,647 --> 00:11:49,423
I think this is probably something I should do alone.

194
00:11:49,798 --> 00:11:50,544
Okay.

195
00:11:57,116 --> 00:12:00,167
Look, I'm really sorry that you rode out all this way.

196
00:12:00,271 --> 00:12:03,248
I guess I just needed your help getting here.

197
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:04,957
You never needed my help.

198
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:09,707
Anyway, I'm gonna go explore a bit.

199
00:12:09,803 --> 00:12:11,341
Just give me a call when you're ready.

200
00:12:12,445 --> 00:12:15,049
My name is Elizabeth. I'm your mother.

201
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:16,152
Peyton.

202
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:17,863
Good luck.

203
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:32,779
Thanks, Luke.

204
00:12:45,002 --> 00:12:46,179
Just get out, Ellie --

205
00:12:46,269 --> 00:12:48,100
out of my house, out of my town,

206
00:12:48,631 --> 00:12:49,895
out of my life.

207
00:12:55,198 --> 00:12:56,093
Hi.

208
00:12:58,584 --> 00:13:02,102
Okay, mom, this is pretty weird.

209
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:04,334
You leave me a note and sneak away in the middle of the night,

210
00:13:04,423 --> 00:13:07,195
and then I get this cryptic phone call. What's going on?

211
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,065
- You know how much I love you.
- Mom --

212
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,191
Honey, sit down.

213
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:15,261
Okay.

214
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:23,961
Over the years since I met your father, I've changed,

215
00:13:24,868 --> 00:13:28,251
and somewhere along the line, I've become someone I don't respect.

216
00:13:28,347 --> 00:13:30,011
Pack a bag and get out,

217
00:13:30,122 --> 00:13:32,467
or  so help me god, I will stab you in your sleep.

218
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,643
I'm boiling water to throw on you.

219
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:36,013
And what's the syrup for?

220
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:37,562
Well, that's so it sticks to you.

221
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,316
- Mom, what are you -- 
- Let me finish.

222
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:45,400
As far back as I can remember, I've had to rely on others.

223
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,375
I've never been able to be alone.

224
00:13:49,849 --> 00:13:51,576
I've never been very strong,

225
00:13:53,534 --> 00:13:55,874
but now it's time for me to try.

226
00:13:56,441 --> 00:13:57,785
I have to.

227
00:14:01,193 --> 00:14:03,450
I'm not going back to Tree Hill, Nathan.

228
00:14:18,963 --> 00:14:23,182
This is my world, okay?! That's my music. This is my art.

229
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:25,373
Just stay out of my life, okay?

230
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:28,875
That was their first single.

231
00:14:30,436 --> 00:14:32,550
Only a few thousand of those exist.

232
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:36,052
I'm  sorry. Your front door was unlocked.

233
00:14:36,318 --> 00:14:37,215
Hey.

234
00:14:38,083 --> 00:14:41,767
If I'm allowed to goin to your room and sneak around, you can do the same here.

235
00:14:42,624 --> 00:14:44,589
Oh, wait.

236
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:47,113
I wasn't allowed to do that, was I?

237
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,076
What are you doing here, Peyton?

238
00:14:52,311 --> 00:14:57,298
Well, I -- I tried to see you and went to your hotel room the night you left,

239
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:59,214
but you were gone.

240
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:02,110
And I didn't know how to find you, and I started to think

241
00:15:02,211 --> 00:15:04,142
maybe you didn't want to be found.

242
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:09,183
But that doesn't really answer my question.

243
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,870
What are you doing here?

244
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:16,136
I have a business proposition for you, actually.

245
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:19,897
Um, I have this friend, right? And she's a musician, and she's good.

246
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:23,557
She's really good, and I want to put out her record.

247
00:15:23,643 --> 00:15:29,391
I just -- I don't know how, so I was thinking maybe you could help me.

248
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:35,511
It's good to see you, Peyton.

249
00:15:57,154 --> 00:15:59,753
"The mockery made him an outsider,

250
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:03,801
and feeling an outsider made him behave like one."

251
00:16:04,185 --> 00:16:05,475
I think that's my book.

252
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,456
How you doing, Faith?

253
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:10,570
Oh, my god, Lucas.

254
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:13,445
It's been, like, a long time.

255
00:16:13,542 --> 00:16:13,997
Too long.

256
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:15,464
Wait a minute. What are you doing here?

257
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,550
How did you find me?

258
00:16:16,658 --> 00:16:20,739
Faith, if you still lived in Tree Hill, there's only one place you'd be.

259
00:16:20,842 --> 00:16:22,938
The only difference between there and here is, well,

260
00:16:23,423 --> 00:16:25,593
our court's got a river that runs next to it.

261
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:28,896
Okay, your mom told me where you were, but I would have found you eventually.

262
00:16:29,011 --> 00:16:31,511
My mom always did have a soft spot for you.

263
00:16:32,332 --> 00:16:35,951
So, how's life as a big-shot Ravens superstar?

264
00:16:36,051 --> 00:16:36,523
Here we go.

265
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,449
Next you'll tell me you're dating some bitchy cheerleader.

266
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:43,124
Move your ass, Haley.

267
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,873
You are not setting a very good example, and I noticed

268
00:16:44,902 --> 00:16:46,394
you weren't paying attention during my tutorial.

269
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:48,489
I know how to sew, Brooke.

270
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:52,183
Come on, get the lead out, girls. These dresses are not gonna sew themselves,

271
00:16:52,267 --> 00:16:53,925
and where the hell is Mouth with my extra fabric?! 

272
00:16:53,955 --> 00:16:56,829
Hey, hey! Are you okay? You seem a little edgy.

273
00:16:56,947 --> 00:16:58,327
I am just focused.

274
00:16:58,527 --> 00:17:01,238
Are you sure this doesn't have anything to do with Lucas going off with Peyton?

275
00:17:01,348 --> 00:17:05,347
No. It's not like they went off on tour together. And besides, it's different this time.

276
00:17:05,518 --> 00:17:06,660
It is different, right?

277
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:07,716
Yes.

278
00:17:08,897 --> 00:17:11,582
Bevin, you're late, and what are those?

279
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,403
Cookies.

280
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,731
Not those. Those little people thingies.

281
00:17:15,827 --> 00:17:19,173
My brother Tommy, my sister Tara, and my nieces Jodie and Kate.

282
00:17:19,507 --> 00:17:21,098
I promised I'd babysit them today.

283
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:22,162
Aren't they cute?

284
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:24,471
And what the hell is she doing here?

285
00:17:24,572 --> 00:17:26,232
Oh, I called her. You said to round up the squad.

286
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:29,123
I didn't mean Rachel. You missed the tutorial.

287
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,555
I missed the tutorial.

288
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:32,299
I think I can wing it.

289
00:17:32,405 --> 00:17:34,077
These dresses look pretty simple.

290
00:17:34,196 --> 00:17:34,852
"Simple"?

291
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:38,478
Uh, Brooke, it's actually a really good idea. We need all the help we can get.

292
00:17:39,963 --> 00:17:41,770
Haley, you're a genius.

293
00:17:41,906 --> 00:17:44,372
Hey, kids, do you like to play dress-up?

294
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,014
I bet you do. This is tutorial girl.

295
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:49,892
She's gonna teach you guys how to make dress-up.

296
00:17:49,978 --> 00:17:50,843
Sound like fun?

297
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,463
Uh, Brooke, this doesn't seem terribly bright.

298
00:17:53,554 --> 00:17:55,910
Haley, you said it yourself. We need all the help we can get.

299
00:17:56,038 --> 00:17:57,765
Come on. Here we go. We'll go this way.

300
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:00,001
Oh, this is gonna be so fun.

301
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:07,675
I don't get it. You finally got your divorce.

302
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:09,746
That's what you wanted, mom. Why don't you just come home?

303
00:18:09,857 --> 00:18:10,820
I can't.

304
00:18:10,962 --> 00:18:13,656
Mom, I can't just drop everything and move away.

305
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,513
I know, and that's why I'm not asking you to come with me.

306
00:18:16,633 --> 00:18:18,076
You have a wife, Nathan,

307
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,027
and whatever it is the two of you are going through right now, that still means something.

308
00:18:22,137 --> 00:18:24,898
I don't want you to make the same mistakes I did.

309
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,794
Housekeeping.

310
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:28,155
I'm fine.

311
00:18:29,422 --> 00:18:31,142
Mom, why are you so spooked?

312
00:18:34,964 --> 00:18:37,370
I'm so sorry, Nathan.

313
00:18:38,324 --> 00:18:39,243
I am.

314
00:18:40,472 --> 00:18:44,318
But the fire at the dealership -- it wasn't an accident.

315
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,146
We were going to get out, remember?

316
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:53,635
But your father wouldn't have that.

317
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:58,013
It was me.

318
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:01,221
I tried to kill him.

319
00:19:07,303 --> 00:19:10,789
I was so miserable that day because of your father.

320
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:15,634
I hadn't been out of rehab long, and it had been a difficult day.

321
00:19:16,295 --> 00:19:20,565
I had to find some strength, some courage to find a way out,

322
00:19:20,656 --> 00:19:22,474
and that's when I found one.

323
00:19:35,203 --> 00:19:37,614
There were just four things left to do.

324
00:19:38,368 --> 00:19:41,333
The first was to type the card.

325
00:19:41,887 --> 00:19:44,883
The second was to deliver it.

326
00:19:54,852 --> 00:19:58,200
The third was to light it.

327
00:20:06,953 --> 00:20:13,544
The fourth was to ask God to take me far away from this person I'd become.

328
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:18,166
I'm sorry, Nathan. I did it for both of us, to free us.

329
00:20:18,234 --> 00:20:18,972
No.

330
00:20:19,213 --> 00:20:20,305
Please, Nathan, wait.

331
00:20:20,415 --> 00:20:23,874
No. You didn't have the courage to leave him, but you had the courage to kill him?

332
00:20:41,947 --> 00:20:46,009
You know how you were kind of joking about me dating a cheerleader? Well...

333
00:20:46,109 --> 00:20:48,324
No, don't say it.

334
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:50,280
Unbelievable.

335
00:20:50,386 --> 00:20:51,281
Who is it?

336
00:20:51,378 --> 00:20:52,448
I love you.

337
00:20:52,616 --> 00:20:53,885
I love you, too.

338
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:56,599
Brooke Davis? Lucas, she is horrible.

339
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:58,289
No, she's not horrible.

340
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:00,848
Actually, she's a really amazing person.

341
00:21:00,948 --> 00:21:02,423
Have you forgotten our freshman year?

342
00:21:02,527 --> 00:21:04,223
As much of it as I can, yes.

343
00:21:04,326 --> 00:21:07,907
Morgan Finley -- senior bitch, captain of the cheerleaders.

344
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,103
You know how much she tortured me and my friends,

345
00:21:10,198 --> 00:21:13,731
until one day some freshman boy came along and defended me,

346
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:16,295
some boy named Lucas Scott.

347
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:19,623
After that, they tortured you all year,

348
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:21,127
but you took it

349
00:21:21,579 --> 00:21:25,665
'cause if they were torturing you, they wouldn't pick on any of us.

350
00:21:25,786 --> 00:21:27,956
Oh, yeah. That was a fun year.

351
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:32,633
When I moved away, Brooke Davis was Morgan Finley's most promising protégé.

352
00:21:33,112 --> 00:21:34,411
She's different now.

353
00:21:34,971 --> 00:21:36,667
Maybe you're different now.

354
00:21:38,374 --> 00:21:40,566
You said you would never join that club --

355
00:21:40,714 --> 00:21:42,756
the elite and the popular.

356
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:47,895
So tell me something, Luke. Now that you're basically the king of that club,

357
00:21:47,989 --> 00:21:49,943
who's looking out for the people like me?

358
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:53,618
The ones who were afraid to go to school?

359
00:21:53,963 --> 00:21:55,564
That's not how it is, Faith.

360
00:21:55,966 --> 00:21:58,976
Look, I'm not defending who Brooke was.

361
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,856
I am defending who she is.

362
00:22:02,903 --> 00:22:06,264
And trust me, she never became Morgan Finley.

363
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:10,457
That's it! No more cookie breaks for anybody! Do you people want to be here all night?!

364
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:14,511
Hey, you're Mouth, right?

365
00:22:14,773 --> 00:22:16,500
You announce the basketball games.

366
00:22:16,741 --> 00:22:17,588
I'm Rachel.

367
00:22:17,705 --> 00:22:19,163
Yeah, I know who you are.

368
00:22:19,925 --> 00:22:23,088
I've  listened to your interviews on the school website.

369
00:22:23,181 --> 00:22:24,109
You're really good.

370
00:22:24,202 --> 00:22:25,166
Really?

371
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:26,196
Thanks.

372
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:29,154
It's just practice for, hopefully, the future.

373
00:22:29,942 --> 00:22:31,226
So what's your thing?

374
00:22:32,625 --> 00:22:33,498
My thing?

375
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:36,736
Yeah. You know, every great sports announcer has a thing.

376
00:22:36,832 --> 00:22:40,333
Like Phil Rizzuto has, "holy cow!"

377
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,459
And, um, Marv Albert has, "yes!"

378
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:49,079
A little more work, a little less talk.

379
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,872
We were just discussing Mouth's thing.

380
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,334
Yeah, it's...

381
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:56,603
not really what it sounds like, Brooke.

382
00:22:56,962 --> 00:22:58,363
Isn't he the cutest?

383
00:22:58,642 --> 00:23:01,652
Aw, well, I hate to interrupt the male bonding,

384
00:23:01,745 --> 00:23:03,847
but, Mouth, I need you to watch the kids.

385
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:05,866
I thought Haley was watching them.

386
00:23:05,966 --> 00:23:08,014
Well, now you're watching them. Chop-chop.

387
00:23:11,817 --> 00:23:13,747
Haley, will you please go pick up more fabric?

388
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:15,076
I thought that was Mouth's job.

389
00:23:15,198 --> 00:23:19,197
Will you please just do what I ask, Haley? My day has been a total crap fest.

390
00:23:19,316 --> 00:23:20,994
I guess Lucas didn't check in, then, huh?

391
00:23:21,102 --> 00:23:23,702
So ? It's not like I don't have problems of my own to worry about.

392
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:25,825
Why are you concerned with whether or not Lucas calls me?

393
00:23:25,912 --> 00:23:26,825
How is that any of your business?

394
00:23:26,934 --> 00:23:29,477
I just want to know what would make a guy leave you

395
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,168
first thing in the morning like that.

396
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,643
It just doesn't seem right.

397
00:23:32,908 --> 00:23:34,717
Thanks for rubbing that in, roommate.

398
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,334
So I was wondering...

399
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,211
this song you want to produce --

400
00:23:46,381 --> 00:23:48,181
what makes you think I could help with it?

401
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:53,180
Well, I mean, mostly 'cause you know a lot about music and the industry,

402
00:23:53,284 --> 00:23:57,293
and, I mean, you do have a really nice little collection here.

403
00:23:57,868 --> 00:23:58,795
"Little"?

404
00:24:16,102 --> 00:24:19,845
It's like heaven, only it probably sounds better.

405
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:21,225
Cure fan?

406
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:24,582
Ew, up until this album.

407
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:27,434
Come on. "Wish" is a great record.

408
00:24:27,525 --> 00:24:30,031
No, "Disintegration" is a great record.

409
00:24:30,127 --> 00:24:31,621
"Wish" was pretty much the end.

410
00:24:31,721 --> 00:24:32,999
- Oh, really? 
- Uh-huh.

411
00:24:33,094 --> 00:24:36,256
You're gonna tell me you don't get chills every time you hear the violin

412
00:24:36,354 --> 00:24:38,028
on "To Wish Impossible Things"?

413
00:24:38,113 --> 00:24:39,320
Yeah, every time.

414
00:24:39,435 --> 00:24:40,064
But?

415
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:42,349
But I don't remember the day.

416
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:43,756
The day?

417
00:24:44,018 --> 00:24:45,638
Yeah, you know, it's like --

418
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:50,732
like with "Disintegration," I remember the very first time I heard that record.

419
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,891
You know, like, I remember everything about that day --

420
00:24:52,983 --> 00:24:55,638
the weather outside and the smell in the air.

421
00:24:55,754 --> 00:24:57,671
I just -- I remember all those things,

422
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:01,296
and that's because that day, I fell in love with something.

423
00:25:02,587 --> 00:25:04,018
You fell in love with an album.

424
00:25:04,117 --> 00:25:04,914
No.

425
00:25:06,662 --> 00:25:08,166
I fell in love with music.

426
00:25:12,317 --> 00:25:14,842
So, speaking of The Cure, um...

427
00:25:16,627 --> 00:25:18,276
are you in remission?

428
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:19,240
No.

429
00:25:20,789 --> 00:25:21,902
I'm sorry.

430
00:25:22,362 --> 00:25:24,125
No, no.

431
00:25:26,878 --> 00:25:28,634
The truth is...

432
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,251
I'm probably gonna be just fine.

433
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:37,186
Oh, okay. That's great. That's --

434
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,496
I'm really glad for you, Ellie.

435
00:25:41,544 --> 00:25:47,223
So, anyway, um, I was thinking that if you are gonna help me with Haley's record

436
00:25:47,356 --> 00:25:50,681
that, well, you could maybe move into the house with me.

437
00:25:50,937 --> 00:25:54,575
My dad, you know, he's out to sea, and he said it's okay.

438
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,876
So what do you think?

439
00:25:57,987 --> 00:26:00,286
I appreciate the invitation, Peyton.

440
00:26:00,629 --> 00:26:04,279
I just -- I-I just really don't have the time.

441
00:26:06,293 --> 00:26:07,140
Yeah.

442
00:26:08,729 --> 00:26:10,421
But stay a bit.

443
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:14,403
There's got to be some other albums here that you are dead wrong about.

444
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,576
So you rode here with Peyton Sawyer?

445
00:26:22,739 --> 00:26:24,982
Man, Tree Hill is trippin' since I left.

446
00:26:25,186 --> 00:26:27,419
Yeah, you're right about that.

447
00:26:27,716 --> 00:26:29,637
So tell me about your life, Faith.

448
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,611
Are you happy here?

449
00:26:30,717 --> 00:26:31,721
I guess so.

450
00:26:31,826 --> 00:26:33,765
It took me a little while to get used to it --

451
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:35,907
leaving Tree Hill, changing schools,

452
00:26:36,002 --> 00:26:39,000
but now it's basically same life, different town.

453
00:26:39,161 --> 00:26:40,229
Your mom sounds good.

454
00:26:40,325 --> 00:26:43,089
Yeah, she is. Finally got a good coaching job.

455
00:26:43,193 --> 00:26:46,469
Not too many schools out there are gonna let a woman coach a boys' basketball team.

456
00:26:46,569 --> 00:26:49,648
Yeah, well, if anyone can do it, she can.

457
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,205
Definitely true.

458
00:26:58,627 --> 00:27:00,247
Look what we have here.

459
00:27:00,558 --> 00:27:02,466
One of the Tree Hill Ravens.

460
00:27:03,647 --> 00:27:04,705
Fan club?

461
00:27:06,998 --> 00:27:08,640
You losers win a game yet?

462
00:27:08,743 --> 00:27:10,401
You losers call next?

463
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:12,015
There's nobody here.

464
00:27:12,113 --> 00:27:14,709
Really? 'Cause we're here.

465
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:20,808
Game to 11 by ones, win by 2. Winners stay, losers walk.

466
00:27:22,973 --> 00:27:25,228
What, us two against him?

467
00:27:26,031 --> 00:27:30,481
No, you two against us.

468
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,730
Our ball.

469
00:27:37,581 --> 00:27:40,187
Same jump shot, different town.

470
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:14,633
9-6.

471
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,289
How's my hair? Still sexy?

472
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,278
She's a girl, for god sakes, man. Guard her.

473
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:19,367
You guard her.

474
00:28:26,152 --> 00:28:28,774
- Game.
- Okay, then. Nice to see you guys.

475
00:28:28,864 --> 00:28:31,451
Take care. See you later. Bye.

476
00:28:32,851 --> 00:28:33,971
Nice game, Luke.

477
00:28:34,499 --> 00:28:36,212
Brooke Davis would be proud.

478
00:28:52,651 --> 00:28:54,140
Can I sit with you?

479
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:55,321
Please?

480
00:28:58,507 --> 00:29:00,451
How did it come to this, mom?

481
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,318
I ask myself that question every single day.

482
00:29:10,509 --> 00:29:13,993
I've been sitting here thinking about my 13th birthday.

483
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:20,319
Dad surprised me with hawks tickets -- front row on the court.

484
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:23,022
We drove all the way to Atlanta, the three of us.

485
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:27,149
I remember that trip, how much fun we had as a family.

486
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,930
I just wanted to replay that memory,

487
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:31,473
just to remember it.

488
00:29:35,329 --> 00:29:37,020
Then I saw your face.

489
00:29:39,475 --> 00:29:41,837
It was always right there in front of me, and I never saw it.

490
00:29:41,944 --> 00:29:42,885
What?

491
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,465
You were never happy.

492
00:29:47,882 --> 00:29:50,427
Dad is a bad guy, mom,

493
00:29:51,026 --> 00:29:56,363
but somewhere deep down, he still just wants me to be the best I can be.

494
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:58,931
He doesn't deserve to die for that.

495
00:30:04,111 --> 00:30:08,800
Two years ago, the coach from Oak Lake Academy came to see your father to recruit you --

496
00:30:08,898 --> 00:30:12,480
the number-one high school basketball program in the country,

497
00:30:12,585 --> 00:30:15,646
and your father sent him away.

498
00:30:15,992 --> 00:30:17,990
- He wouldn't do that.
- He did.

499
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:21,205
And I told him it wasn't his decision to make.

500
00:30:21,306 --> 00:30:24,022
You were gonna go to that school whether he liked it or not

501
00:30:24,085 --> 00:30:26,228
and that I was leaving with you.

502
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,489
What did he say?

503
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,464
He looked at me.

504
00:30:30,794 --> 00:30:32,725
He spoke calmly.

505
00:30:34,111 --> 00:30:37,775
He said that if I took you away, he would find us...

506
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:41,978
and he would kill me.

507
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:45,248
Don't you see, Nathan?

508
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:50,479
Your father will always try to control you. He'll never let you go.

509
00:31:01,594 --> 00:31:03,503
You know, thanks for reminding me of a few things today.

510
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:04,340
Like what?

511
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:09,027
Well, how much fun we used to have hanging out at the River Court all day,

512
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:11,853
playing ball, growing up.

513
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,176
Yeah, it was like old times, wasn't it?

514
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:15,362
Yeah, it was.

515
00:31:15,485 --> 00:31:18,073
No uniforms, no crowds, no cheerleaders.

516
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,752
Just you and me and the game.

517
00:31:19,843 --> 00:31:23,313
I almost forgot what it was like -- playing just to play.

518
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:26,807
Speak for yourself. I wanted to crush those guys.

519
00:31:28,526 --> 00:31:30,141
I was right about you, you know --

520
00:31:30,249 --> 00:31:34,619
that you've changed, but I think maybe it's for the best.

521
00:31:34,794 --> 00:31:38,508
Okay, you've teased me all day about how much I've changed,

522
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:39,664
but what about you?

523
00:31:39,777 --> 00:31:40,483
What about me?

524
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:43,203
Well, for a girl who used to be afraid to go to school,

525
00:31:43,312 --> 00:31:45,548
you sure stood up to those guys at the court.

526
00:31:45,738 --> 00:31:48,893
Like I said, maybe it's for the best.

527
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,614
So you said back there I reminded you of a few things.

528
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:53,735
What else?

529
00:31:53,906 --> 00:31:55,936
How much I miss seeing you.

530
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:58,534
Oh, yeah, that's like a no-brainer.

531
00:32:01,769 --> 00:32:03,118
Don't be a stranger, Luke.

532
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,918
Hey, the phone goes both ways.

533
00:32:05,025 --> 00:32:07,715
Yeah, I know, but I didn't say, "keep in touch."

534
00:32:07,803 --> 00:32:09,323
I said, "don't be a stranger."

535
00:32:11,505 --> 00:32:12,482
All right.

536
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:21,638
Bevin.

537
00:32:22,932 --> 00:32:25,502
This is terrible! The stitching is all wrong.

538
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,843
I missed the tutorial.

539
00:32:28,712 --> 00:32:29,535
Hmm?

540
00:32:33,307 --> 00:32:36,525
This is actually kind of perfect.

541
00:32:36,619 --> 00:32:37,659
I know.

542
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:39,460
But it's mine.

543
00:32:39,555 --> 00:32:41,247
I ordered it online this morning.

544
00:32:41,338 --> 00:32:43,885
Wait a second. You came over here to make your own dress?

545
00:32:43,977 --> 00:32:47,055
Well, I liked the design. I just didn't trust the designer.

546
00:32:47,558 --> 00:32:48,549
See ya, Mouth.

547
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,771
Call me.

548
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:51,743
Bye.

549
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:55,803
Well, great! Thanks, everybody, for wasting my time today!

550
00:32:55,879 --> 00:32:57,059
Brooke, stop it.

551
00:32:57,164 --> 00:32:58,767
Everybody here's been busting their butt for you,

552
00:32:58,847 --> 00:33:00,446
and you've pretty much been a bitch all day long.

553
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:03,716
We haven't gotten anything done. I have been dreaming about this for so long.

554
00:33:03,802 --> 00:33:04,638
Don't you understand?

555
00:33:04,736 --> 00:33:09,054
No, not if it changes you, Brooke. Trust me, no dream is worth that.

556
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,439
Shut it down, Mouth -- all of it.

557
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,013
Brooke, that's not --

558
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:25,844
No, just stop the orders and give everybody their money back.

559
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,737
We spent most of the money, Brooke.

560
00:33:28,837 --> 00:33:31,537
How do you think we bought all the material and supplies?

561
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:35,323
Then I'll finish it myself.

562
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:36,605
It's my problem.

563
00:33:37,048 --> 00:33:39,438
Everybody, just go home, please.

564
00:33:40,745 --> 00:33:44,401
I'm really sorry for the way I treated all of you today. I, um...

565
00:33:45,522 --> 00:33:47,073
I haven't been myself.

566
00:33:48,439 --> 00:33:52,614
Hey, kids, hey, here, will you take these?

567
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:53,979
Thanks.

568
00:33:54,414 --> 00:33:55,494
I'm so sorry.

569
00:33:57,488 --> 00:33:59,868
That was a really nice thing to do, Brooke...

570
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:02,414
with my CDs.

571
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,978
I can't believe you saw the first U2 tour in the states.

572
00:34:19,094 --> 00:34:20,129
Yep.

573
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:22,688
They opened for the psychedelic furs,

574
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:28,217
and if you're lucky, I might even have a t-shirt from that tour somewhere around here.

575
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:36,884
Hey, I'm gonna get some water. Can I get you some?

576
00:34:59,926 --> 00:35:01,569
So this is it?

577
00:35:01,805 --> 00:35:05,724
There's no food, Ellie, and there's barely any furniture!

578
00:35:05,827 --> 00:35:08,909
Nothing like a bed and a rockin' soundtrack to die to, right?

579
00:35:09,019 --> 00:35:10,764
You don't know what you're talking about.

580
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:13,584
You came here to die.

581
00:35:16,334 --> 00:35:18,603
Who the hell do you think you are?

582
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:20,712
Don't I deserve the truth?

583
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,849
The truth?

584
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,834
The truth is I don't have any furniture because I'm always on the road.

585
00:35:24,919 --> 00:35:28,217
I don't keep any food in the house because I eat out.

586
00:35:29,236 --> 00:35:31,089
This is the way I've always lived, Peyton,

587
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,805
except I usually get the added benefit of being alone...

588
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,857
At least for the last 17 years, I did.

589
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:46,971
You didn't come here to seek music advice.

590
00:35:48,465 --> 00:35:50,351
You came here out of guilt.

591
00:35:50,465 --> 00:35:54,137
And guess what? I don't want it, and I don't need it.

592
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:55,587
In fact, get out.

593
00:36:01,127 --> 00:36:04,362
You know what? Fine. Fine! Fine! You're right, okay?

594
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:08,511
So I came to see how you are. Is that so bad?

595
00:36:08,631 --> 00:36:12,487
Am I such a horrible person because I was worried about you?

596
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:17,106
I just -- I thought we could do something really good together, okay?

597
00:36:17,159 --> 00:36:19,766
Maybe even something, like, great.

598
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,891
I wanted to sell that record so we could raise money for cancer research.

599
00:36:25,021 --> 00:36:26,606
Sorry I cared.

600
00:36:38,876 --> 00:36:41,025
So I guess this is goodbye, mom.

601
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:44,315
Just for a little while.

602
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:47,388
I'll never leave you for good.

603
00:36:47,912 --> 00:36:49,965
Well, I'm not so good on my own, either.

604
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,538
The day you emancipated yourself, you broke my heart.

605
00:36:58,511 --> 00:37:01,572
Now I realize it was your strongest moment.

606
00:37:02,882 --> 00:37:05,164
Hopefully I can find that kind of strength.

607
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:09,339
I don't want to be alone.

608
00:37:11,444 --> 00:37:13,256
You're not alone.

609
00:37:13,413 --> 00:37:14,620
You have Haley.

610
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:18,301
Go home and deal with your marriage.

611
00:37:20,074 --> 00:37:24,112
Don't avoid it until it becomes something you have to run from.

612
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,107
Bye, mom.

613
00:37:40,574 --> 00:37:41,446
Bye.

614
00:37:58,284 --> 00:37:59,825
Sorry about Ellie.

615
00:38:01,011 --> 00:38:03,598
I don't think I'm evergonna see her again, Luke.

616
00:38:34,037 --> 00:38:35,914
Hi. Where are you?

617
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:39,060
Hey, Brooke, I'm really sorry, but it's gonna be a little while.

618
00:38:39,158 --> 00:38:40,567
Peyton's car broke down.

619
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:42,467
Great.

620
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:47,491
So the two of you are gonna spend the night in some seedy motel.

621
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:50,688
Yeah, and then one thing will lead to another, and --

622
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:55,196
Pretty risky trick, mister.

623
00:38:55,288 --> 00:38:56,634
You weren't worried, were you?

624
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,845
Totally not for a second worried.

625
00:39:03,742 --> 00:39:05,547
What? Bad day?

626
00:39:06,591 --> 00:39:08,635
I just really needed my boyfriend.

627
00:39:08,828 --> 00:39:10,862
Well, he's here now.

628
00:39:10,984 --> 00:39:11,906
Put me to work.

629
00:39:12,009 --> 00:39:13,538
I don't want to work anymore.

630
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:15,576
Can we go do something you want to do?

631
00:39:15,673 --> 00:39:18,671
Actually, I have something I need to go do.

632
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:21,281
Okay.

633
00:39:21,581 --> 00:39:22,553
With you.

634
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,529
You have one message.

635
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:33,031
Miss Harp, this is Dr. Gold calling from East Lake Memorial.

636
00:39:33,118 --> 00:39:36,783
It is extremely important that you call me back.

637
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:41,103
As I said earlier, we need to talk about your decision to stop treatment.

638
00:39:41,261 --> 00:39:43,005
I really...

639
00:40:15,554 --> 00:40:16,574
You're right.

640
00:40:17,402 --> 00:40:18,604
The song's good.

641
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:22,191
It needs background vocals.

642
00:40:22,291 --> 00:40:24,338
Well, yeah, it's just a demo.

643
00:40:24,469 --> 00:40:26,099
It's a business arrangement.

644
00:40:26,964 --> 00:40:27,752
Of course.

645
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:29,178
Okay.

646
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:39,914
Hey.

647
00:40:40,936 --> 00:40:41,845
What's up?

648
00:40:42,877 --> 00:40:46,301
I just wanted to see you.

649
00:41:00,022 --> 00:41:01,412
This is my world, Brooke --

650
00:41:02,139 --> 00:41:03,804
or at least it used to be.

651
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:05,881
I have been here before, you know.

652
00:41:05,989 --> 00:41:07,199
I know.

653
00:41:08,111 --> 00:41:10,677
But I never told you what this place is to me.

654
00:41:12,092 --> 00:41:14,281
It's not just a court.

655
00:41:15,334 --> 00:41:17,712
It's where I came from. It's where I belong.

656
00:41:18,170 --> 00:41:19,269
It's my world.

657
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:21,802
Do I get to be a part of this world?

658
00:41:21,904 --> 00:41:23,201
The biggest part.

659
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:26,160
Ladies and gentlemen, what a treat we have tonight --

660
00:41:26,254 --> 00:41:28,702
River Court legend Lucas Scott.

661
00:41:28,801 --> 00:41:31,033
It's been months since Scott's run a full-court game here,

662
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:34,677
so I guess the big question is will he play tonight?

663
00:41:37,376 --> 00:41:38,826
Go get 'em, boyfriend.

664
00:41:55,051 --> 00:41:56,121
Nice shot.

665
00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:03,869
