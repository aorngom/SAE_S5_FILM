1
00:00:00,598 --> 00:00:02,512
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,583 --> 00:00:04,171
So, are we staying yet?

3
00:00:04,851 --> 00:00:06,798
Are we exclusive yet?

4
00:00:08,357 --> 00:00:09,911
Game on, Brooke Davis.

5
00:00:11,297 --> 00:00:12,941
I would like to say something.

6
00:00:13,172 --> 00:00:15,824
Uh, Mayor Mullins, I object.

7
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:17,979
Well, this is not a court of law, Dan.

8
00:00:18,057 --> 00:00:18,993
Sit down.

9
00:00:26,191 --> 00:00:27,462
I'm still your father.

10
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:29,945
But you're not my father, are you?

11
00:00:30,031 --> 00:00:31,549
Divorce is fine, Deb.

12
00:00:33,461 --> 00:00:34,937
You seem surprised.

13
00:00:35,506 --> 00:00:38,908
Here. It's my cocaine vial.

14
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:42,372
Thought you might like it, considering you were buying drugs today.

15
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:47,614
Ellie was buying marijuana, but not for the reasons you think.

16
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:48,694
She's sick.

17
00:00:49,662 --> 00:00:51,218
She has cancer, Peyton.

18
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,855
Always and forever.

19
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,795
That's what sucks, Haley.

20
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:57,239
I still do love you.

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:00:59,184
I just can't trust you.

22
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,750
No way, Hales!

23
00:01:43,772 --> 00:01:44,651
Let me see it.

24
00:01:44,717 --> 00:01:46,831
I look... like an idiot.

25
00:01:46,888 --> 00:01:48,931
Dude, I saw you in your headgear.

26
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:52,106
Don't call me "dude," and I thought we promised not to talk about that in public.

27
00:01:52,157 --> 00:01:53,540
Whatever, dude.

28
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:55,752
Look, I'm counting to three, and then I'm coming in.

29
00:01:55,803 --> 00:01:57,006
One, two --

30
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:00,954
th--

31
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:59,927
Whoa-oa! Okay, this is hot!

32
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:00,981
Excuse me?

33
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:03,091
Well, I mean -- oh, ew.

34
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:05,911
No, not that I noticed or could ever possibly think of you that way.

35
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:07,616
I just -- okay. Ew.

36
00:03:08,201 --> 00:03:12,557
Look, this party's my one chance to get Brooke to finally rethink this whole non-exclusive thing.

37
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:14,267
Just be...

38
00:03:15,215 --> 00:03:16,669
well, exclusive.

39
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,420
Do you think she'll like it?

40
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,902
You're asking me to enter the sexual mind of Brooke Davis?

41
00:03:20,965 --> 00:03:21,916
She's your roommate.

42
00:03:21,983 --> 00:03:23,222
She's your girlfriend.

43
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:25,414
Sort of, kind of.

44
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:29,715
All right, let me see what I can find out. I'll do a little roommate recon for you.

45
00:03:29,787 --> 00:03:31,368
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

46
00:03:31,685 --> 00:03:33,136
Now it's your turn.

47
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,323
I see a belly-dancer costume with your name on it, love.

48
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,679
Nathan won't know what hit him.

49
00:03:40,616 --> 00:03:44,742
Please. I could go naked to this stupid party, and it wouldn't make a difference.

50
00:03:46,151 --> 00:03:47,216
Okay, ew.

51
00:03:51,822 --> 00:03:54,864
Well, well, well. Mayor Mullins.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,001
What have we here?

53
00:03:56,089 --> 00:03:58,095
Sex scandal 101.

54
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,713
Handcuffs, cocaine, skanky hookers.

55
00:04:03,052 --> 00:04:04,695
No offense, ladies.

56
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,568
So, what's your preference --

57
00:04:06,645 --> 00:04:08,186
video or stills?

58
00:04:09,078 --> 00:04:12,124
Then again, I'm a businessman. We could make a deal.

59
00:04:13,215 --> 00:04:15,473
You drop your bid for re-election

60
00:04:15,785 --> 00:04:17,490
and resign immediately,

61
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,324
and this video goes away.

62
00:04:21,802 --> 00:04:24,396
Good boy. At least you're a smart pervert.

63
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,542
Oh, by the way...

64
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,198
you're gonna endorse me for mayor.

65
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:39,603
Hey. Knock knock.

66
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:41,580
I'm making lunch. You hungry?

67
00:04:42,097 --> 00:04:43,391
Not really.

68
00:04:44,186 --> 00:04:48,138
Come on. You've seen enough afterschool specials to know that you've got to eat.

69
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,273
I know. I will, just...

70
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,656
not right now.

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,879
Okay.

72
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,718
What are you going as?

73
00:04:55,543 --> 00:04:56,785
An angel.

74
00:04:56,892 --> 00:04:58,420
Brooke's gonna be the devil.

75
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:00,715
Imagine that.

76
00:05:00,795 --> 00:05:03,268
I'm just not really feeling it.

77
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:08,178
All right. Well, if you get hungry, let me know.

78
00:05:08,392 --> 00:05:09,898
Hey, um...

79
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,826
look, I know, all right, about Ellie.

80
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:15,949
What?

81
00:05:17,092 --> 00:05:18,593
The breast cancer.

82
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:21,418
Did you think, like, I couldn't handle it, or...

83
00:05:22,002 --> 00:05:23,697
'cause if you were keeping it from me, then --

84
00:05:23,753 --> 00:05:24,761
I wasn't.

85
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:29,027
I wasn't.

86
00:05:29,477 --> 00:05:30,691
I didn't know.

87
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:32,832
Oh.

88
00:05:34,588 --> 00:05:36,118
Well, now you do.

89
00:05:37,577 --> 00:05:38,949
- I'm sorry.
- No.

90
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:43,092
Guess my moms are just dropping like flies, huh?

91
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:02,175
What  the hell are you doing here?

92
00:06:02,255 --> 00:06:03,926
Just savoring the indian summer.

93
00:06:04,012 --> 00:06:06,091
Well, savor it at the beach house, Dan.

94
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:10,069
It's what you'll get in the divorce if you'll just sign the damn papers already.

95
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,452
You mean these papers?

96
00:06:12,264 --> 00:06:14,068
I'll sign them for you right now, sweetheart.

97
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:16,218
Thank you.

98
00:06:18,054 --> 00:06:20,130
I just need you to sign these for me.

99
00:06:24,026 --> 00:06:26,091
"Declaration of candidacy"?

100
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,861
I'm running for mayor.

101
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:34,231
You're running against Mullins, a 10-year incumbent? Fat chance.

102
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:35,475
Guess you didn't hear.

103
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,364
Mullins resigned this morning.

104
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:38,875
Shocking.

105
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:40,886
Fine.

106
00:06:41,077 --> 00:06:44,864
Run for mayor. Run for "Miss Ten North Carolina," for all I care.

107
00:06:45,156 --> 00:06:47,317
At least I won't be around to watch.

108
00:06:47,404 --> 00:06:48,703
Don't be so sure.

109
00:06:49,104 --> 00:06:50,534
Check the date.

110
00:06:55,184 --> 00:06:57,864
You postdated this for two months from now.

111
00:06:58,607 --> 00:07:01,510
Dan, why don't you just go and quit torturing me?

112
00:07:01,582 --> 00:07:06,196
I will... in 60 days, after we play house and show the Tree Hill voters

113
00:07:06,246 --> 00:07:10,434
what a great family man Dan Scott is. Appearances are everything, right, Deb?

114
00:07:10,521 --> 00:07:12,253
Why are you doing this?

115
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,105
Because Mullins got in my way with Whitey,

116
00:07:14,182 --> 00:07:16,419
and I don't like it when people get in my way.

117
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:18,861
Besides, I've got money and I've got freedom.

118
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,875
At least I will when I get rid of you.

119
00:07:21,033 --> 00:07:23,879
Only  thing left... is power.

120
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:28,703
Forget it.

121
00:07:29,671 --> 00:07:30,960
And what about Nathan?

122
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:34,678
If you stick around for the next two months...

123
00:07:35,302 --> 00:07:36,721
I'll leave him alone.

124
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,055
I could turn him against you, Deb.

125
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:42,215
But if you stay with me...

126
00:07:42,799 --> 00:07:45,526
I'll back off for as long as you like.

127
00:07:46,991 --> 00:07:48,219
Who knows?

128
00:07:48,712 --> 00:07:51,579
After 60 days, you may fall in love with me again.

129
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:55,389
You want us to live together, fine.

130
00:07:55,522 --> 00:07:58,655
I've been pretending to love you for a long time now, Dan.

131
00:07:58,731 --> 00:08:00,821
60 days is nothing.

132
00:08:05,239 --> 00:08:06,928
"Mayor Dan Scott."

133
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,036
I like it.

134
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:13,404
New tune?

135
00:08:14,557 --> 00:08:16,909
Sounds pretty good. Speed it up a little.

136
00:08:18,168 --> 00:08:19,157
Faster.

137
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,615
Faster.

138
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,344
# For he's a jolly good fellow #

139
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,032
Sorry.

140
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:35,581
You know, the devil doesn't have sequins or feathers or breasts, for that matter.

141
00:08:35,634 --> 00:08:38,127
Well, in my universe, she does.

142
00:08:39,103 --> 00:08:40,578
Did you even follow the pattern?

143
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:41,490
No.

144
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:42,779
Brooke, you have to do that!

145
00:08:42,851 --> 00:08:45,507
- Says who?
- Says every sewing teacher ever.

146
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:46,998
Otherwise, you'll end up with something like --

147
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,079
Like this?

148
00:08:50,255 --> 00:08:52,600
That... looks really good.

149
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:54,162
Thank you. I just whipped it up.

150
00:08:54,238 --> 00:08:56,543
What are we gonna do for you? I was thinking...

151
00:08:56,685 --> 00:08:59,516
sexy nurse, catholic schoolgirl, playboy bunny...

152
00:08:59,567 --> 00:09:01,633
No, no, and forget it.

153
00:09:01,723 --> 00:09:04,336
It's a costume party. You go as a sexy whatever.

154
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:06,060
All right, well, sexy, not slutty.

155
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:07,063
Fine.

156
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:09,963
Oh, I know.

157
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:13,480
The classic "get my man to see me in a new light" costume.

158
00:09:13,571 --> 00:09:16,034
How about a "get my man to come to this thing" costume?

159
00:09:16,117 --> 00:09:19,633
You got one of those? 'Cause I'm not even sure Nathan's showing up at this thing.

160
00:09:21,539 --> 00:09:23,970
Well, you're gonna make my job easy this year.

161
00:09:24,088 --> 00:09:26,720
There's nothing worse than cheering for a bunch of losers.

162
00:09:26,792 --> 00:09:28,369
Well, it's all about you, Brooke.

163
00:09:28,492 --> 00:09:29,434
What's up?

164
00:09:30,576 --> 00:09:33,145
Are you going to this masquerade party at Tric?

165
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:34,912
Wasn't planning on it. Why?

166
00:09:35,014 --> 00:09:38,834
Just figured it might be the perfect occasion to stop punishing your wife.

167
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,584
Haley is really hurting, Nathan.

168
00:09:41,672 --> 00:09:46,121
Come on, how hard would it be to stop by, smile at her, and tell her she looks cute?

169
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:47,692
Harder than you think.

170
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:50,544
She hasn't written a song since you guys split up.

171
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,278
I guess her talent was tied to you.

172
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,299
No Nathan, no music.

173
00:09:57,415 --> 00:09:59,483
- She put you up to this?
- No.

174
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:05,125
But if I hear one more accidental cover of "Wind beneath my wings," I am going to slit my wrists.

175
00:10:05,192 --> 00:10:07,701
So, please, Nathan, do it for me.

176
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:11,464
And when I get through with her, she's gonna look hot as hell.

177
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:13,282
You can trust me -- I'm m the devil.

178
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:16,256
I'll think about it.

179
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:17,239
Okay.

180
00:10:26,549 --> 00:10:27,305
Hey.

181
00:10:27,904 --> 00:10:29,875
Did you talk to Brooke about my costume yet?

182
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,607
Yeah. How do you feel about head-to-toe tattoos and a nose ring?

183
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:35,518
Not  good.

184
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:37,627
Well, think about it, Tommy Lee.

185
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,724
I got to dump these.

186
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,795
What is this, some kind of California thing Brooke picked up in "The O.C."?

187
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:47,090
I'm sure it goes back further than that.

188
00:10:54,308 --> 00:10:56,801
Hey, since when is Brooke such a metalhead, anyway?

189
00:10:58,143 --> 00:11:00,043
Um... I-I don't know.

190
00:11:00,114 --> 00:11:04,507
I guess even after all this time, people can still surprise you.

191
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:25,346
Is it true? Do you have cancer?

192
00:11:26,555 --> 00:11:27,312
Yes.

193
00:11:27,374 --> 00:11:28,700
Is Peyton at risk?

194
00:11:28,817 --> 00:11:30,129
She might be.

195
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,655
But only 10% of all breast cancers are genetic.

196
00:11:33,722 --> 00:11:36,035
- Is yours one of them?
- I don't know.

197
00:11:36,476 --> 00:11:39,984
So at some point down the line, you should get her checked.

198
00:11:43,538 --> 00:11:45,039
And what about you?

199
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:48,425
I was in remission for a while.

200
00:11:49,144 --> 00:11:50,510
Not anymore.

201
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:54,203
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:54,332 --> 00:11:55,330
Yeah.

203
00:11:55,662 --> 00:11:59,016
It's not how I pictured my life turning out, that's for sure.

204
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:05,027
I know it's crazy, but I can't help feeling like it's some kind of karmic payback, you know?

205
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,665
I don't think it works like that.

206
00:12:07,678 --> 00:12:10,929
Is this why you came back, to make things right with Peyton?

207
00:12:11,401 --> 00:12:15,630
I wanted her and you to be aware of her genetic history.

208
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:18,676
And, sure, I wanted to get to know her.

209
00:12:18,724 --> 00:12:21,077
I wanted her to get to know me.

210
00:12:22,506 --> 00:12:24,006
So she could lose another mother.

211
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:26,767
No, that is exactly what I didn't want.

212
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,506
I was still in remission when I first got here.

213
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:31,195
And don't worry...

214
00:12:31,364 --> 00:12:33,914
I am not about to let her watch me die.

215
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:37,744
Look, Ellie, I am sorry for everything that you are going through,

216
00:12:37,785 --> 00:12:41,747
but you understand that I have to think about Peyton first, last, always.

217
00:12:41,831 --> 00:12:43,873
Oh,  you mean now that you're back in town?

218
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:45,066
Like me?

219
00:12:45,152 --> 00:12:47,574
No, nothing like you, actually.

220
00:12:47,646 --> 00:12:48,614
Larry!

221
00:12:50,641 --> 00:12:51,717
I'm sorry.

222
00:12:56,207 --> 00:12:58,721
If you want me to leave for good this time,

223
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,189
just say the word.

224
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:05,567
She's your daughter now.

225
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,446
It's up to you.

226
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,642
Is that one of ours?

227
00:13:18,745 --> 00:13:21,638
Inspired by, but I made a few modifications.

228
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:22,605
Like what?

229
00:13:22,694 --> 00:13:26,600
Well, if you cut the leg higher, it's less coverage, but it's actually more flattering.

230
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:30,154
And a halter is way better for faking buff Madonna arms.

231
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:33,590
Interesting, but the devil doesn't have feathers.

232
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,773
What  is with you people? So she's a feathery devil.

233
00:13:38,329 --> 00:13:39,149
Hi!

234
00:13:39,553 --> 00:13:40,762
Is that your costume?

235
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:42,636
Uh, is that yours?

236
00:13:42,703 --> 00:13:43,604
Maybe.

237
00:13:44,137 --> 00:13:45,611
I think you'll like it.

238
00:13:45,851 --> 00:13:47,060
I know I will.

239
00:13:47,131 --> 00:13:50,706
You might want to warn your other boyfriends if they plan on seeing you at the party.

240
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:53,255
I think you're gonna be all tied up, so to speak.

241
00:13:53,337 --> 00:13:54,367
Really?

242
00:13:54,546 --> 00:13:56,277
Well, a girl can dream.

243
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:58,114
But I thought you were playing hard-to-get.

244
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:00,378
Actually, I believe you're the one playing hard-to-get.

245
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:02,825
Doesn't mean we can't have a whole lot of fun in the meantime.

246
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:06,455
Just means we'll be wearing a whole lot more clothes while we're having it.

247
00:14:06,752 --> 00:14:07,710
Right.

248
00:14:07,832 --> 00:14:09,316
Commitment thing.

249
00:14:09,501 --> 00:14:12,046
Think my costume's gonna help you change your mind.

250
00:14:12,163 --> 00:14:15,777
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt, but do you have a matching thong?

251
00:14:18,092 --> 00:14:20,023
Oh, you know it, sister.

252
00:14:29,475 --> 00:14:30,862
What the hell is this?

253
00:14:31,266 --> 00:14:34,472
New campaign, new wardrobe.

254
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,988
And that "candidate's wife" look doesn't come cheap.

255
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:44,055
Appearances are everything, right, Dan?

256
00:14:45,075 --> 00:14:46,795
Bedroom's this way, boys!

257
00:14:57,139 --> 00:14:58,167
Peyton?

258
00:15:04,286 --> 00:15:05,514
Peyton, listen --

259
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,898
I thought you were going as an angel.

260
00:15:09,002 --> 00:15:11,362
I am -- I'm the angel of death.

261
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:14,469
Thought it was appropriate.

262
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,111
Honey...

263
00:15:22,083 --> 00:15:24,432
you know the worst part about your mom dying?

264
00:15:25,995 --> 00:15:27,679
I have to pick just one?

265
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:32,009
How suddenly she was gone.

266
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:36,842
I mean, it was like, one minute she was there,

267
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,377
talking about what we were gonna have for dinner, and the next, she was just...

268
00:15:42,219 --> 00:15:43,504
...gone.

269
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:45,291
Forever.

270
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,253
I kept thinking about all the things I would have said to her if I had known.

271
00:15:55,864 --> 00:16:00,197
And then I realized what I really had to worry about was all the things I was gonna say to you.

272
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:02,281
- Daddy, I'm --
- Honey, you were so little.

273
00:16:02,368 --> 00:16:05,281
There was so much left to talk about with mom.

274
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:08,480
So many things she would have told you as you grew up.

275
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:13,580
So I started writing it all down, whatever I could think of --

276
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:16,576
her favorite color, favorite food.

277
00:16:17,359 --> 00:16:19,489
Our first date, first kiss.

278
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:24,005
But all that did was make me realize all the things I didn't know.

279
00:16:24,101 --> 00:16:27,214
Things I couldn't know -- girl stuff.

280
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:31,505
Like what she would have said to you about sex or the day you got your first --

281
00:16:31,572 --> 00:16:32,724
Dad, I just...

282
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:34,502
I know, honey, but...

283
00:16:36,544 --> 00:16:38,332
don't you ever just wonder?

284
00:16:40,506 --> 00:16:41,602
Yeah.

285
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,287
All the time.

286
00:16:45,186 --> 00:16:48,268
Well, now, Ellie...

287
00:16:48,555 --> 00:16:52,379
has the one thing your mother didn't.

288
00:16:52,913 --> 00:16:55,150
She's got a fair warning.

289
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,773
There's time.

290
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:02,707
Time for no regrets... no... wondering.

291
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:07,279
Maybe you should go see her. Talk to her.

292
00:17:07,356 --> 00:17:10,751
Let her answer any questions that you might have.

293
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,875
Like what?

294
00:17:15,481 --> 00:17:18,837
Like... who your real father is.

295
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,621
I think you make a very pretty angel of death.

296
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:28,849
Have fun.

297
00:18:03,866 --> 00:18:05,842
Hey, it's Nathan.

298
00:18:07,358 --> 00:18:10,230
We should, uh, get together tonight.

299
00:18:10,485 --> 00:18:13,061
There's this costume party. We can meet up afterwards.

300
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:15,993
Hey, there's just one thing.

301
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:18,243
Haley can't know.

302
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:39,976
Remember -- no tugging.

303
00:18:40,008 --> 00:18:42,557
- Okay, but --
- No tugging!

304
00:18:43,146 --> 00:18:47,069
You're tough. Any chance I can lose these heels halfway through the night?

305
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,871
No pain, no gain, girl.

306
00:18:48,972 --> 00:18:50,744
Now get your game face on.

307
00:18:52,449 --> 00:18:53,668
Other game.

308
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,248
Okay, we'll work on that.

309
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:00,098
Hello, ladies.

310
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:01,604
Mouth! Ha ha!

311
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,010
You look incredible.

312
00:19:04,097 --> 00:19:05,225
Thanks. So do you.

313
00:19:05,321 --> 00:19:09,223
Wow. It's a good thing you and Lucas are non-exclusive.

314
00:19:09,341 --> 00:19:11,327
So I guess you're over Erica.

315
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,675
My girlfriend -- ex-girlfriend.

316
00:19:14,748 --> 00:19:16,068
Oh, sorry, Mouth.

317
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,266
No, I'm okay.

318
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:21,533
I'm not gonna spend my senior year chasing someone that doesn't care about me anymore.

319
00:19:22,258 --> 00:19:25,868
Yeah, that's... that's really smart.

320
00:19:30,758 --> 00:19:33,072
Ohh! Yes!

321
00:19:34,198 --> 00:19:36,409
Oh, slower, slower...

322
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:40,506
Oh, that's it.

323
00:19:44,669 --> 00:19:46,506
Where the hell is my bed?

324
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:49,466
Oh, hi, Dan. Nice to see you, too.

325
00:19:49,553 --> 00:19:51,319
Where's all my stuff, Deb?

326
00:19:51,412 --> 00:19:52,522
I gave it away.

327
00:19:52,605 --> 00:19:53,393
You what?

328
00:19:53,475 --> 00:19:56,322
I had to. It was all wet and smelly.

329
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,544
And how did that happen?

330
00:19:57,602 --> 00:20:02,727
The sprinklers came on by accident, after I tossed everything out the window.

331
00:20:02,801 --> 00:20:04,443
That part was on purpose.

332
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:08,533
Besides, I had to make room for Hans to whip me...

333
00:20:09,092 --> 00:20:10,576
...into shape.

334
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:14,047
A politician's wife has to look the part.

335
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:15,184
Right, Dan?

336
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:18,995
I guess you'll have to find someplace else to sleep.

337
00:20:19,771 --> 00:20:20,791
Mmm...

338
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:32,209
Nice wings.

339
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,226
Nathan?

340
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:36,504
I couldn't even tell it was you.

341
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:39,634
This is how I can see everything and pretend like I was never even here.

342
00:20:39,729 --> 00:20:41,247
Very sneaky, Bruce.

343
00:20:43,877 --> 00:20:46,822
Hate to say it, but your wife looks pretty hot.

344
00:20:51,307 --> 00:20:52,915
Haley always looks hot.

345
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,730
Hey! You look great.

346
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:00,826
Are you talking to me yet?

347
00:21:00,907 --> 00:21:03,708
Not really, but I guess you're talking to me.

348
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:05,807
Peyton, I don't understand why you're so pissed off.

349
00:21:05,894 --> 00:21:08,422
Really? You come back to town after months of being away

350
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:10,221
and try to pretend like nothing happened.

351
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:12,249
I'm not pretending anything. I'm just...

352
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:15,249
I'm sorry I didn't stay in touch with you. It was hard to keep up with people.

353
00:21:15,361 --> 00:21:18,581
Haley, it wasn't me, okay? I'm not that needy.

354
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:20,112
But you didn't even call Nathan.

355
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:20,994
I did call.

356
00:21:21,081 --> 00:21:24,122
Anyway, I just don't like what you did.

357
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,374
But your husband just said you look hot.

358
00:21:26,435 --> 00:21:29,880
So if you do still love him, there's your in.

359
00:21:41,252 --> 00:21:43,363
Hey, Peyton, I love your costume.

360
00:21:43,444 --> 00:21:46,890
Mouth! Look at you! You're, like, the hottest guy here.

361
00:21:48,395 --> 00:21:50,449
- Oh, no.
- Oh, nice.

362
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:51,831
Wait till Brooke sees him.

363
00:21:51,917 --> 00:21:53,005
She's gonna love it, right?

364
00:21:53,017 --> 00:21:56,341
Uh-huh. No. She thinks Motley Crue is the least-sexy band of all time.

365
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:57,949
We got to tell Lucas.

366
00:22:00,642 --> 00:22:01,866
Uh...

367
00:22:06,674 --> 00:22:09,076
Oh, no, you didn't.

368
00:22:09,157 --> 00:22:10,099
I  did.

369
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:13,053
You are so gullible. Tommy Lee?

370
00:22:13,238 --> 00:22:13,888
What?

371
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:16,801
He's like 40 and looks like that.

372
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,443
You set me up?

373
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,865
You should have been a pirate.

374
00:22:21,942 --> 00:22:25,229
Nothing like a little Johnny Depp to make a girl want to commit.

375
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,926
I heard we got back together again.

376
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:31,684
Tommy Lee, Pamela Anderson.

377
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:33,574
Right.

378
00:22:33,811 --> 00:22:37,569
At the very least, we did have a hot weekend together in Vegas.

379
00:22:38,377 --> 00:22:40,005
You want to dance?

380
00:22:41,409 --> 00:22:43,569
Unless you're seeing someone.

381
00:22:43,958 --> 00:22:45,095
No.

382
00:22:45,362 --> 00:22:46,984
Not exclusively.

383
00:22:56,953 --> 00:22:58,289
You okay?

384
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:01,214
Peachy.

385
00:23:26,756 --> 00:23:27,951
Excuse me?

386
00:23:28,292 --> 00:23:29,623
Hiya, wifey.

387
00:23:30,115 --> 00:23:32,322
You told me to find another place to sleep...

388
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:36,945
in the buff, naturally, since, thanks to you, some homeless person has all my clothes.

389
00:23:37,181 --> 00:23:39,689
Great way to kick off my humanitarian campaign, though.

390
00:23:39,757 --> 00:23:41,343
Forgot to thank you for that.

391
00:23:41,512 --> 00:23:44,465
Would you care to join me, or would you rather sleep on the floor?

392
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,002
Fine.

393
00:24:08,695 --> 00:24:10,784
Sweet dreams, Danny boy.

394
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,870
Hey, have you seen Nathan?

395
00:24:17,925 --> 00:24:18,797
What's he dressed as?

396
00:24:18,868 --> 00:24:24,557
I don't know, actually. I know he's seen me, but he's like the invisible man or something.

397
00:24:24,812 --> 00:24:27,890
Um, Haley... are you okay?

398
00:24:28,443 --> 00:24:32,032
Yeah, if "okay" is like heels that are killing me,

399
00:24:32,078 --> 00:24:34,659
and I'm about five minutes from going home and bingeing on cookie dough.

400
00:24:34,699 --> 00:24:35,954
That's not what I mean.

401
00:24:36,604 --> 00:24:38,739
There's money missing from the register at the café.

402
00:24:38,805 --> 00:24:43,636
I've noticed a pattern the past couple of weeks, and it always finds its way back right after payday.

403
00:24:43,702 --> 00:24:48,037
Look, I know your parents are gone, and I know that things are a bit tight.

404
00:24:48,415 --> 00:24:49,563
Was it you?

405
00:24:51,585 --> 00:24:53,357
Yeah. Um...

406
00:24:53,746 --> 00:24:55,118
I'm really sorry.

407
00:24:55,272 --> 00:24:56,475
So am I...

408
00:24:56,726 --> 00:25:00,335
that you didn't feel that you could come to me and ask if you needed help.

409
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:01,501
I thought we were closer.

410
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,303
We are. It won't happen again.

411
00:25:04,458 --> 00:25:05,393
Good.

412
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:10,980
I want you to know that I am always there for you, no matter what.

413
00:25:11,543 --> 00:25:12,603
Thanks.

414
00:25:13,278 --> 00:25:15,752
Why don't I take this? Consider it interest.

415
00:25:15,834 --> 00:25:16,740
Okay.

416
00:25:53,446 --> 00:25:54,496
Hi!

417
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:55,831
Nice costume.

418
00:25:56,512 --> 00:25:57,521
You like it?

419
00:25:57,726 --> 00:25:58,852
Not really.

420
00:25:59,989 --> 00:26:02,210
I mean, it's just not really you.

421
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:06,025
Yeah, I -- Brooke thought I could...

422
00:26:08,028 --> 00:26:11,233
I just wanted you to want me again. I...

423
00:26:11,806 --> 00:26:14,269
That's not the problem, Haley, trust me.

424
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:19,342
I mean, a sexy makeover's not gonna fix us, right?

425
00:26:19,865 --> 00:26:22,107
Yeah, you're right. I mean...

426
00:26:24,698 --> 00:26:26,940
I look ridiculous, don't I?

427
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:28,932
Haley, no...

428
00:26:29,116 --> 00:26:30,121
I'm sorry.

429
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:43,360
Having fun?

430
00:26:43,718 --> 00:26:48,476
Not really. I mean, I'm psyched to see the band, but I still had to force myself to come here tonight.

431
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:49,545
Me too.

432
00:26:49,883 --> 00:26:51,982
I'm just dealing with some personal stuff.

433
00:26:52,065 --> 00:26:53,115
Yeah, me too.

434
00:26:53,202 --> 00:26:55,357
And someone spilled soda on my wings.

435
00:26:55,597 --> 00:26:58,184
I think that was me.

436
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,188
I got an idea how we could make this night less sucky.

437
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,440
Are you propositioning me, Mouth?

438
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:08,581
Uh, yeah.

439
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,599
To dance.

440
00:28:33,319 --> 00:28:36,888
All right! Are you guys all ready for Fall Down Boy?

441
00:28:36,898 --> 00:28:37,987
Fall Out Boy.

442
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,790
Oh, um, right, right.

443
00:28:40,205 --> 00:28:43,716
Anyway... do I hear a woot-woot?

444
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:51,494
Guess not. All right, well...

445
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:56,768
without further ado, Fall Out Boy.

446
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:03,916
What are you doing?

447
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,058
The band is playing. You're missing it.

448
00:30:06,237 --> 00:30:07,773
This is such a bad idea.

449
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,703
But Nathan totally talked to you.

450
00:30:09,781 --> 00:30:12,790
He swooped in like some kind of knight in Batman armor.

451
00:30:12,858 --> 00:30:15,356
That's not the point! I look like an idiot!

452
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,703
Okay, maybe now that you messed up your hair --

453
00:30:18,776 --> 00:30:22,847
This "Grease" thing is a lie. You turn into some cigarette-smoking hussy,

454
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:24,905
and you get your man? That doesn't work.

455
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,285
You were smoking?

456
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:27,792
Even if it did...

457
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:32,852
that's not who I am. I'm a tutor. I'm -- I'm a nerd.

458
00:30:33,374 --> 00:30:35,328
You're a rock star.

459
00:30:36,102 --> 00:30:37,526
Not anymore.

460
00:30:38,652 --> 00:30:40,235
I'm just Haley.

461
00:30:43,941 --> 00:30:46,092
That really should be enough.

462
00:30:49,304 --> 00:30:51,114
I'm done playing games, Brooke.

463
00:30:51,842 --> 00:30:53,244
I'm just gonna go home.

464
00:30:55,267 --> 00:30:55,964
Okay.

465
00:30:56,026 --> 00:30:57,770
And there better be cookie dough.

466
00:31:43,949 --> 00:31:46,231
Hey, thank you for helping me earlier.

467
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:48,159
I'm sorry I freaked out like a baby.

468
00:31:48,212 --> 00:31:50,461
I just want things back the way they were.

469
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:16,916
Hey.

470
00:32:18,877 --> 00:32:22,466
I wanted to make sure you were okay. I saw you take the plunge and...

471
00:32:22,533 --> 00:32:23,802
Nathan kissed me.

472
00:32:24,115 --> 00:32:24,791
What?

473
00:32:24,904 --> 00:32:28,543
I didn't even know what was happening. It just -- it happened, and then he was gone.

474
00:32:29,788 --> 00:32:31,068
Did you go after him?

475
00:32:31,145 --> 00:32:33,761
No. It was just so romantic and perfect.

476
00:32:33,854 --> 00:32:36,905
I just wanted to come right home and not mess it up.

477
00:32:37,939 --> 00:32:39,608
Well, then, I guess you're okay.

478
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:42,639
Yeah. It was a totally out-of-body experience for me.

479
00:32:42,778 --> 00:32:44,381
Maybe I should get Nathan to kiss me.

480
00:32:44,492 --> 00:32:45,481
Oh, shut up.

481
00:32:47,387 --> 00:32:48,886
All right, then, uh...

482
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,066
- I'm gonna head home.
- Okay.

483
00:32:52,147 --> 00:32:53,744
Thanks for the costume advice.

484
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:56,125
Remind me to never have you spy for me.

485
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:57,462
I'm sorry!

486
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:02,802
Luke, uh... there's just one more thing. I...

487
00:33:04,293 --> 00:33:07,979
Your mom thinks I stole money from the café.

488
00:33:08,557 --> 00:33:10,001
Why does she think that?

489
00:33:10,083 --> 00:33:11,691
'Cause I told her I did.

490
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:15,274
'Cause I... was covering for you.

491
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:18,100
I saw you take it and...

492
00:33:19,484 --> 00:33:21,045
What's going on, Luke?

493
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:31,970
I needed to buy some medicine.

494
00:33:37,351 --> 00:33:38,606
For what?

495
00:33:40,947 --> 00:33:42,569
For my heart, Hales.

496
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:45,058
I have HCM.

497
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:56,342
Angel of death. You're a little early.

498
00:33:58,277 --> 00:34:00,115
How was the show?

499
00:34:01,462 --> 00:34:03,065
You want to come inside?

500
00:34:03,387 --> 00:34:04,754
I'm not staying.

501
00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:07,196
I'm still glad you came --

502
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:10,013
You. Not the death part.

503
00:34:10,104 --> 00:34:13,909
Look, I don't want to be curious about you, but I can't help it. I am.

504
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:17,749
Well, selfishly, I'm glad that's one battle you're losing.

505
00:34:18,711 --> 00:34:19,895
I'm just scared.

506
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:20,530
Of what?

507
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:24,758
Of forgetting my mom, okay? Anna.

508
00:34:29,018 --> 00:34:31,864
I used to have one of her t-shirts that smelled like her,

509
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:34,507
and I slept with it every night

510
00:34:34,604 --> 00:34:38,690
until, one day, it started to smell more like me than it did her.

511
00:34:39,954 --> 00:34:43,841
And so I took it out and tried every detergent I could find,

512
00:34:44,019 --> 00:34:47,737
trying to find that smell. And I couldn't. It was gone.

513
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:53,364
And... so now sometimes I test myself, you know, just to see if I can find that smell.

514
00:34:54,295 --> 00:34:56,134
And once in a while, I can.

515
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:59,128
But it's getting harder and harder.

516
00:34:59,227 --> 00:35:00,404
I understand.

517
00:35:00,573 --> 00:35:03,634
It's bad enough that you're really into music.

518
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,959
I don't want to find out you're an artist, too.

519
00:35:06,035 --> 00:35:10,245
'Cause there are some things I know I got from her. I had to.

520
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:14,458
And I don't -- I don't want to change that.

521
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:20,604
Well, uh, the tendency towards drugs, which I would love to yell at you about --

522
00:35:20,715 --> 00:35:22,318
that's from me.

523
00:35:22,876 --> 00:35:25,595
But I can't draw to save my life.

524
00:35:25,846 --> 00:35:27,935
Those sketches I saw in your room --

525
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,694
that's from your mom.

526
00:35:31,374 --> 00:35:32,758
You know that.

527
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:37,965
And as far as your dad's concerned, when he sent me away all those years ago,

528
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:39,592
that was the right move.

529
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:42,312
I've done some pretty questionable things in my life, Peyton.

530
00:35:42,393 --> 00:35:44,053
I would have sent me away, too.

531
00:35:46,516 --> 00:35:47,846
But you're here now.

532
00:35:48,226 --> 00:35:49,381
That's right.

533
00:35:49,792 --> 00:35:53,656
And if you want to know things, then I want you to know them.

534
00:35:53,729 --> 00:35:56,065
I'll tell you anything -- everything.

535
00:35:56,268 --> 00:35:58,009
And if you don't want to know,

536
00:35:58,645 --> 00:36:00,145
that's okay, too.

537
00:36:00,784 --> 00:36:02,388
It's up to you.

538
00:36:17,117 --> 00:36:19,632
Well, well. We meet again.

539
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:21,121
Thanks for coming.

540
00:36:21,286 --> 00:36:22,498
How could I not?

541
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:24,306
You must have gotten my letter.

542
00:36:24,408 --> 00:36:25,586
Yeah, I got it.

543
00:36:25,904 --> 00:36:27,005
Did you like the perfume?

544
00:36:27,087 --> 00:36:29,093
I'm kind of sexy like that sometimes.

545
00:36:29,707 --> 00:36:31,919
So what can Chris Keller do for you?

546
00:36:33,604 --> 00:36:35,560
He can help Haley with her music.

547
00:36:36,535 --> 00:36:37,614
No, I'm serious.

548
00:36:38,136 --> 00:36:40,116
Apparently, she's hit some kind of slump.

549
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,114
And you care why?

550
00:36:42,131 --> 00:36:43,676
Because she loves it.

551
00:36:43,856 --> 00:36:45,211
And I love her.

552
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:48,222
Wow. How heroic.

553
00:36:48,427 --> 00:36:50,805
Or maybe just completely stupid.

554
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:52,166
I mean, why call me?

555
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:56,511
Because even though you're an ass, Haley's music came a long way with you.

556
00:36:56,793 --> 00:36:59,523
You said in that letter you'd do anything to help her.

557
00:36:59,906 --> 00:37:01,165
This is it.

558
00:37:02,655 --> 00:37:05,245
Look, not that I don't love second chances,

559
00:37:05,332 --> 00:37:07,248
but what makes you think you can trust me?

560
00:37:07,316 --> 00:37:08,742
Oh, I don't trust you.

561
00:37:08,911 --> 00:37:10,459
But Haley does.

562
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:14,052
Besides, if you touch her, I'll crush you.

563
00:37:19,194 --> 00:37:20,959
Well, this is gonna cost you.

564
00:37:21,046 --> 00:37:24,826
I mean, we've got studio space, first-class accommodations,

565
00:37:24,906 --> 00:37:27,575
my time, which is worth a lot.

566
00:37:28,149 --> 00:37:29,976
And I'm kind of digging that watch.

567
00:37:30,566 --> 00:37:32,291
Don't screw with me, Keller.

568
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:36,243
All right, tell you what, give me the rest of this sandwich, I'm in.

569
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:40,192
All right. It's a deal, then.

570
00:37:40,268 --> 00:37:42,018
And this stays between us.

571
00:37:58,704 --> 00:37:59,738
Hello?

572
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:00,983
It's me.

573
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:03,472
I'm sorry, Deb.

574
00:38:03,589 --> 00:38:05,555
I never meant for it to come to this.

575
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,092
I mean, we loved each other once, didn't we?

576
00:38:11,264 --> 00:38:13,087
I know I loved you.

577
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:15,990
Dan, what are you doing?

578
00:38:16,071 --> 00:38:18,282
I just had to talk to you.

579
00:38:20,361 --> 00:38:21,807
Because...

580
00:38:22,958 --> 00:38:25,615
I'm waiting for the glue to dry.

581
00:38:31,416 --> 00:38:33,603
You superglued the phone?!

582
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:37,131
You want to play with me, game on, bitch.

583
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,222
Good night.

584
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,123
How was the rest of your night?

585
00:38:58,215 --> 00:39:02,357
Well, Lucas thought he could make me jealous with that "Baywatch" bimbo.

586
00:39:02,445 --> 00:39:04,191
Two can play at that game.

587
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:05,569
Hmm.

588
00:39:07,032 --> 00:39:08,052
Brooke...

589
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:13,130
be careful.

590
00:39:15,137 --> 00:39:17,456
His heart's more fragile than you think.

591
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:37,368
Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote,

592
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,310
"There is no privacy that cannot be penetrated."

593
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:53,942
"No secret can be kept in the civilized world."

594
00:40:01,796 --> 00:40:02,794
Hey.

595
00:40:03,244 --> 00:40:04,448
You're still awake.

596
00:40:05,395 --> 00:40:07,331
Of course. That's what fathers do --

597
00:40:07,434 --> 00:40:08,830
wait up for their daughters.

598
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:14,873
Did you talk to Ellie?

599
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:16,326
Yeah.

600
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:17,852
Good.

601
00:40:19,603 --> 00:40:22,321
But I didn't have to ask who my real father is.

602
00:40:23,182 --> 00:40:24,525
I already know.

603
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:49,807
"...society is a masked ball

604
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:53,472
where everyone hides his real character...

605
00:40:55,501 --> 00:40:58,224
and reveals it by hiding."

606
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:47,145
