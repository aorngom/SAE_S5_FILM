1
00:00:00,488 --> 00:00:02,049
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,213 --> 00:00:04,295
There are 82 letters in here,

3
00:00:04,443 --> 00:00:06,002
and they're all addressed to you.

4
00:00:06,147 --> 00:00:08,883
They stole a couple of designs, they didn't steal your talent.

5
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:10,083
We'll put together a website.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,203
We'll sell them ourselves.

7
00:00:11,294 --> 00:00:12,287
Clothes over Bros?

8
00:00:12,377 --> 00:00:14,005
Oh, my gosh!

9
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,210
You made that?

10
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:17,779
It's actually kind of perfect.

11
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,033
But it's mine.

12
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:21,368
You came over here to make your own dress?

13
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:25,771
Mayor of Tree Hill, North Carolina, Dan Scott!

14
00:00:26,848 --> 00:00:29,583
I believe that's the same brand of booze used to poison me.

15
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:31,417
And wait for it -- this is the good part.

16
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,359
That's someone you care about buying it.

17
00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:34,992
I need to ask you something.

18
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:36,793
Did you try to kill Dan?

19
00:00:37,005 --> 00:00:38,445
That's the last shred of evidence.

20
00:00:38,528 --> 00:00:40,364
Maybe this can finally set you free.

21
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,349
It's me...

22
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:43,330
Lucas knows.

23
00:00:43,429 --> 00:00:45,539
If you are gonna help me with Haley's record,

24
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,835
well, you could maybe move in to the house with me?

25
00:00:47,934 --> 00:00:49,522
It's a business arrangement.

26
00:00:49,913 --> 00:00:50,882
Stay with me tonight.

27
00:00:52,696 --> 00:00:54,716
Oh, I was hoping you would say that.

28
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,019
H.L. Mencken wrote,

29
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,206
"Every normal man must be tempted at times to spit upon his hands,

30
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:50,667
hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats."

31
00:01:51,404 --> 00:01:52,727
Great, we're 0 and 2.

32
00:01:52,827 --> 00:01:54,381
What the hell are you doing out there?

33
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,353
Me?

34
00:01:55,542 --> 00:01:57,015
Why don't you try passing the ball sometime?

35
00:01:57,109 --> 00:01:58,459
It's called carrying you!

36
00:01:58,562 --> 00:02:00,265
I might as well be out there alone!

37
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,385
All right!

38
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:05,511
Let's see who won tonight's pissing contest!

39
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:09,958
Lucas Scott, 16 points.

40
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:12,837
Nathan Scott, 22 points.

41
00:02:12,945 --> 00:02:15,723
Combined assists -- two!

42
00:02:15,864 --> 00:02:19,073
I guess we skipped the part about sharing the ball.

43
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:25,066
Basketball is a team game, and there's no "I" in "team"!

44
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:29,816
I assume you morons can spell.

45
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:35,124
S-U-C-K. What's that spell?

46
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:36,260
Ravens.

47
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:42,852
Okay, I know you're new at this, but the cheeriness stops when we lose.

48
00:02:42,936 --> 00:02:45,828
Hey, I'm sorry we lost, but Nathan's gonna need consoling.

49
00:02:46,078 --> 00:02:48,363
And you're the consolation prize?

50
00:02:48,455 --> 00:02:50,682
Oh, I like the way you think, roommate.

51
00:02:50,782 --> 00:02:53,666
Good, because, um, I've got dibs on the bedroom tonight.

52
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:56,091
Are you issuing a pre-emptive scrunchy?

53
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:58,444
Anything for love.

54
00:02:58,535 --> 00:03:00,933
Thank you. You're the best. See you guys later.

55
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:04,704
I think you're rubbing off on her.

56
00:03:04,795 --> 00:03:07,507
Why? Is being desperately horny contagious?

57
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:11,188
Guess I'll just have to sleep with Lucas.

58
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,663
Oh, you mean, sleep at Lucas'.

59
00:03:13,877 --> 00:03:16,162
Unfortunately, that's exactly what I mean.

60
00:03:16,251 --> 00:03:18,477
No sex till our hearts catch up with our hormones,

61
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:21,015
but there are other things we can do.

62
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:22,970
Oh, really? Under Karen's roof?

63
00:03:24,698 --> 00:03:26,234
Being in love sucks.

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,607
The worst part about losing is seeing you afterwards.

65
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,052
So then stop losing.

66
00:03:39,572 --> 00:03:41,575
By the way, I think I isolated your problem.

67
00:03:41,682 --> 00:03:42,864
It's your ex-wife.

68
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:44,841
For your information, she's still my wife.

69
00:03:44,952 --> 00:03:46,004
You leave her out of this.

70
00:03:46,108 --> 00:03:48,688
I would, but I ran into her in your bed the other day.

71
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:52,232
I know you usually pull C's in history, so I'm gonna give you a little help here.

72
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:53,930
It has a way of repeating itself.

73
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,944
What's that supposed to mean?

74
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:57,803
You want to bounce a basketball or a baby on your knee?

75
00:03:57,894 --> 00:04:00,700
Haley gets pregnant. You stick around. How convenient for her.

76
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:02,660
It didn't work for Karen, did it?

77
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:04,065
It worked for your mom.

78
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:05,055
Whatever, dad.

79
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:06,343
Haley would never do that.

80
00:04:06,453 --> 00:04:07,532
I hope you're right.

81
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:09,185
But you gotta ask yourself --

82
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:11,275
how far is she willing to go?

83
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:13,889
Haley.

84
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:17,387
Wow, look at you. You're absolutely glowing.

85
00:04:20,207 --> 00:04:22,114
- Okay, hi.
- Hey.

86
00:04:22,389 --> 00:04:23,383
Sorry you lost.

87
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:24,464
You  looked good, though.

88
00:04:24,763 --> 00:04:25,880
Yeah, thanks.

89
00:04:26,004 --> 00:04:29,288
Listen, I want to know if maybe you wanted to come over, and I could cook dinner

90
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,879
and maybe... breakfast.

91
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:36,956
I'd love to.

92
00:04:39,835 --> 00:04:42,822
So, what if I start sleepwalking

93
00:04:42,922 --> 00:04:45,373
and my pajamas accidentally fall off

94
00:04:45,468 --> 00:04:47,447
and I end up in your bed?

95
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:50,014
Well, as long as you're there in the morning...

96
00:04:50,345 --> 00:04:52,239
"when the sun rises on my heart."

97
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,024
Lucas Scott, that is so unfair! You are not allowed to quote from my letters!

98
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,818
- Hi!
- Hey.

99
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,847
Hey, you.

100
00:05:03,084 --> 00:05:04,636
- Oh, my God.
- Hey.

101
00:05:04,908 --> 00:05:07,061
0 and 2 -- can't you do anything right without me?

102
00:05:08,405 --> 00:05:09,818
- Keith.
- Hey, nephew.

103
00:05:09,973 --> 00:05:12,265
It is so great to have you back.

104
00:05:12,361 --> 00:05:13,530
Is Jules with you?

105
00:05:13,715 --> 00:05:14,624
Uh, no.

106
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:15,572
Good.

107
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:17,397
I never liked her, by the way.

108
00:05:18,506 --> 00:05:19,596
I'm, uh...

109
00:05:19,798 --> 00:05:23,821
I'm gonna crash on my couch, give you two some catch-up time.

110
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:25,710
It's so good to see you.

111
00:05:27,052 --> 00:05:27,835
You too.

112
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:30,416
You, on the other hand, I never want to see again.

113
00:05:30,935 --> 00:05:31,691
Bye.

114
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,104
I guess that makes you 0 and 3, huh?

115
00:05:35,137 --> 00:05:36,004
Yeah.

116
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,736
Okay, so what's the story with Brooke?

117
00:05:49,814 --> 00:05:53,401
You're back together, and she says she never wants to see you again?

118
00:05:53,602 --> 00:05:55,250
Yeah, we're back together.

119
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,085
But she wrote letters over the summer,

120
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:00,511
and I've been reading one a day and kind of teasing her.

121
00:06:01,474 --> 00:06:04,468
Love letters. Well, that's one step up from tattoos.

122
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:09,529
Look, um... I know you were upset with me when you left.

123
00:06:09,618 --> 00:06:11,145
I  should have told you about Jules.

124
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:12,773
Yeah, you should have.

125
00:06:13,362 --> 00:06:16,266
But... you know, that's a tough one.

126
00:06:16,603 --> 00:06:20,415
"Keith, your lunatic brother hired your fiancée

127
00:06:20,496 --> 00:06:22,311
to sleep with you and break your heart.

128
00:06:22,404 --> 00:06:23,849
Up for a game of horse?"

129
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,321
I know, but...

130
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:30,313
Hey, look, Luke, I forgave you a long time ago.

131
00:06:30,408 --> 00:06:31,562
You were protecting me.

132
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,430
As messed up as it was, you did what you thought was right.

133
00:06:36,267 --> 00:06:37,605
So where you been?

134
00:06:37,714 --> 00:06:39,776
I mean, why did it take you so long to find Jules?

135
00:06:39,878 --> 00:06:41,189
Oh, it didn't.

136
00:06:41,558 --> 00:06:44,128
Once I knew her real name, it wasn't that hard.

137
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,126
But the woman that I found wasn't Jules.

138
00:06:47,758 --> 00:06:50,323
Emily wasn't the person I thought she was.

139
00:06:51,587 --> 00:06:54,607
More importantly, she wasn't your mom.

140
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:57,359
It took me longer to deal with that.

141
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,137
That why you came back?

142
00:07:02,277 --> 00:07:05,387
I came back because Deb told me everything.

143
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,525
Pulling Dan out of the fire was a brave thing, Luke.

144
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:11,893
Stupid... but brave.

145
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:14,038
A lot of guys would have never gone in there.

146
00:07:14,604 --> 00:07:16,631
Sometimes I wish I hadn't.

147
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,030
Who else knows what you did?

148
00:07:20,242 --> 00:07:23,005
Well, you, me, and Deb.

149
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:25,845
And Dan -- kind of choked it out of me.

150
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,587
No, it's fine. It's okay.

151
00:07:28,902 --> 00:07:31,019
And Peyton knows, too.

152
00:07:32,126 --> 00:07:34,904
You kept the Jules secret for two months.

153
00:07:35,006 --> 00:07:36,017
Nice work.

154
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:40,748
So how's your mom?

155
00:07:41,582 --> 00:07:43,000
She'll be happy to see you.

156
00:07:43,109 --> 00:07:44,333
Do me a favor --

157
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:46,515
let me surprise her.

158
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,282
You got it.

159
00:07:58,344 --> 00:07:59,926
Hey. How was the game?

160
00:08:02,296 --> 00:08:03,530
That bad, huh?

161
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:06,937
No, it's just... this is odd, right?

162
00:08:07,018 --> 00:08:10,930
Like, I don't know, it's just odd having somebody else here.

163
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,922
It's a good odd, though.

164
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:18,427
We got any bands yet?

165
00:08:19,609 --> 00:08:21,214
I have calls out to everyone.

166
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,555
Nobody wants to be the first to commit.

167
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,848
But all it takes is one band.

168
00:08:26,029 --> 00:08:27,275
The rest will fall in line.

169
00:08:27,406 --> 00:08:28,337
Check this out.

170
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:30,813
Nada Surf is playing in Charlotte tomorrow night.

171
00:08:31,036 --> 00:08:33,529
They'd be great for the album, don't you think?

172
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:40,009
Okay,  just try a little bit of that.

173
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:45,972
Mmm... too much mac, not enough cheese.

174
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,253
So what were you and Dan talking about after the game?

175
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:55,685
Oh, um, just the usual. Dan trying to control my life.

176
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:01,228
Look how cute she is.

177
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,404
Ow!

178
00:09:04,193 --> 00:09:05,411
You okay? Let me see.

179
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,115
You just grazed it.

180
00:09:09,206 --> 00:09:10,057
Let me get you a band-aid.

181
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:11,406
They're in the bathroom. Kiss first.

182
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:26,480
What are you doing?

183
00:09:27,117 --> 00:09:29,867
Oh, I was just... looking for band-aids.

184
00:09:29,956 --> 00:09:32,116
Well, buddy, you found my birth-control patches.

185
00:09:32,204 --> 00:09:34,625
Those fix a whole 'nother problem.

186
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:35,786
Next cabinet.

187
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:49,396
Okay, the bedroom is all yours.

188
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:53,361
I'll be sleeping on the couch all night, praying I don't hear the boring married sex.

189
00:09:53,545 --> 00:09:54,662
Oh, my god.

190
00:09:55,241 --> 00:09:57,236
"Congratulations, your designs have been selected

191
00:09:57,316 --> 00:09:59,737
to appear at this year's 'Rogue Vogue' showcase."

192
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:01,237
Cool. What's "Rogue Vogue"?

193
00:10:01,336 --> 00:10:04,689
It's like a competition for emerging fashion designers in New York?

194
00:10:04,766 --> 00:10:07,642
"Your designs will be modeled for all the major labels."

195
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:08,498
Shut up.

196
00:10:08,582 --> 00:10:10,621
Brooke, that's so awesome. I didn't even know you applied.

197
00:10:10,702 --> 00:10:13,028
I didn't. That's why this is so bizarre.

198
00:10:13,424 --> 00:10:14,463
Wait a second.

199
00:10:14,859 --> 00:10:18,476
Remember, last year, Lucas submitted Peyton's artwork to Thud Magazine?

200
00:10:18,563 --> 00:10:20,006
Oh, you're right.

201
00:10:20,758 --> 00:10:24,485
This has Lucas written all over it. He is so sweet.

202
00:10:24,621 --> 00:10:27,240
Unless he's being a total jerk and quoting my letters to me,

203
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:29,070
which I'm getting back, by the way.

204
00:10:29,198 --> 00:10:29,923
I'm gonna google this.

205
00:10:30,028 --> 00:10:31,095
But not in the bedroom.

206
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:33,728
Still bleeding here.

207
00:10:35,314 --> 00:10:36,102
What took you so long?

208
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:37,372
I couldn't find it.

209
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,999
Haley, the other night, when we were together...

210
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:45,795
I mean, we're good with birth control, right?

211
00:10:47,710 --> 00:10:48,834
You're still on it?

212
00:10:49,522 --> 00:10:52,861
Well, of course, I am, but I wasn't that night.

213
00:10:53,636 --> 00:10:56,607
I'm sorry. I know it was stupid, I just, um...

214
00:10:56,764 --> 00:10:57,840
Yeah, I gotta go.

215
00:10:57,937 --> 00:11:00,143
What? What is this?

216
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,659
I can't believe my dad was right.

217
00:11:01,767 --> 00:11:03,490
You talked to Dan about this?

218
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:06,394
Nathan -- Nathan, please don't walk out! You do it all the time.

219
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:09,359
That's because it keeps me from saying things you don't want to hear.

220
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:20,208
Good morning, gentlemen!

221
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:25,778
Well, 5:00 a.m. comes awful early, especially when you're 0 and 2.

222
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,263
Get on the bus now.

223
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:29,792
Where are we going?

224
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,618
To our gym.

225
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:33,442
Coach, you're getting senile.

226
00:11:33,543 --> 00:11:34,687
This is our gym.

227
00:11:34,785 --> 00:11:36,064
Not anymore.

228
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:37,273
Come  on, load up!

229
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:38,484
Go, go!

230
00:11:43,722 --> 00:11:46,518
I hope you boys have had your tetanus shots

231
00:11:46,612 --> 00:11:49,929
because you're gonna be spending a lot of time here.

232
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:52,464
What's wrong with the other gym?

233
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:54,443
It's got my name on it.

234
00:11:55,723 --> 00:11:58,217
And I'm tired of y'all disgracing it.

235
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:03,196
So it's either find another gym or change my name.

236
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,794
And I like my name.

237
00:12:06,198 --> 00:12:08,382
You really expect us to practice in this dump?

238
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:10,523
Oh, not only practice.

239
00:12:10,641 --> 00:12:14,908
Till further notice, you're gonna play all your games in here.

240
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:19,638
But first, you're gonna clean it up.

241
00:12:22,859 --> 00:12:23,773
Here you go...

242
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,669
co-captain.

243
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,536
Where are my letters? I want them back.

244
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,669
Brooke, seeing you like this makes...

245
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:50,260
"the sun go down on my heart."

246
00:12:50,345 --> 00:12:51,562
Oh, I hate you.

247
00:12:51,714 --> 00:12:53,671
This is not fair. You don't get to tease me.

248
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,442
Okay, I'll stop.

249
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:58,493
You know, I missed you last night.

250
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:01,197
Well, I was gonna invite you to spend the night tonight.

251
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:04,789
You know, reward you for doing a little writing of your own.

252
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:05,784
Reward me.

253
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,964
But now there's a price of admission.

254
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:10,526
Let me guess -- the letters.

255
00:13:10,624 --> 00:13:12,339
Yep. Bring them.

256
00:13:12,464 --> 00:13:14,497
Or you'll find out what it's like to be teased.

257
00:13:14,612 --> 00:13:15,282
Okay.

258
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:17,468
What?

259
00:13:17,933 --> 00:13:19,665
Oh,  and don't worry. I'll clean up.

260
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:24,429
So the guy told me he was 26, but he was really 22.

261
00:13:24,528 --> 00:13:25,828
Big secret.

262
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,829
You think that's funny, don't you, wearing my clothes?

263
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:31,199
Well, I made it.

264
00:13:31,377 --> 00:13:32,678
Besides, it's free advertising.

265
00:13:32,774 --> 00:13:34,974
Oh, really, I thought you charged by the hour.

266
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:36,928
Hey.

267
00:13:37,302 --> 00:13:39,834
I'm officially confirming my room reservation for tonight.

268
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:43,375
Lucas is coming over for his "thank you" for submitting me to "Rogue Vogue."

269
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:46,243
You do know there are other ways to thank someone, right?

270
00:13:46,336 --> 00:13:47,541
Mmm, but none so fun.

271
00:13:47,646 --> 00:13:49,860
I hope you guys have more fun than I did last night.

272
00:13:49,958 --> 00:13:53,346
Yeah, what caused the naily interruptus anyway?

273
00:13:55,602 --> 00:13:56,447
Okay.

274
00:13:57,502 --> 00:14:01,212
When Nathan and I slept together, we kind of weren't protected.

275
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:03,556
No wonder he was snooping through the bathroom.

276
00:14:03,658 --> 00:14:06,646
Haley, you're usually little Miss Responsible.

277
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,793
I am all for the sex part,

278
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:11,434
but I kind of want to slap you for the lack-of-protection part.

279
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:14,078
I know about birth control. My mom sat me down a long time ago

280
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:16,632
and asked me what I was more afraid of getting -- herpes or pregnant.

281
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:17,395
And what did you say? 

282
00:14:17,425 --> 00:14:19,595
I said, "I haven't even kissed a boy, I'm only 7."

283
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,414
Your mom was progressive.

284
00:14:22,951 --> 00:14:24,710
You're not... pregnant, right?

285
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:27,316
No, and I'm on the pill now.

286
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,392
Okay, so what's really the problem?

287
00:14:29,476 --> 00:14:30,474
That's what I said.

288
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:31,490
You told him?

289
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:32,988
Yeah, well, hence the walk-out.

290
00:14:33,078 --> 00:14:34,545
What did you expect?

291
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:37,621
There are deal-breakers for 17-year-old boys, even married ones.

292
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,039
There's a time to keep your mouth shut and there is a time to lie --

293
00:14:40,115 --> 00:14:41,292
that was lie time.

294
00:14:41,375 --> 00:14:43,062
I don't want to lie to my husband.

295
00:14:43,167 --> 00:14:45,203
I guess that's in the vows, huh?

296
00:14:45,526 --> 00:14:48,606
I wonder if you knew that when you signed up at the ripe old age of, like, 12.

297
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:51,752
The point is, I think Nathan thinks I did this on purpose,

298
00:14:51,838 --> 00:14:53,971
like I was trying to trap him into something.

299
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,008
Did you?

300
00:14:55,093 --> 00:14:56,264
Brooke, no.

301
00:14:56,352 --> 00:14:59,175
Look, I'm just saying, if you didn't stop him,

302
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:03,445
then maybe, somewhere, on some level, that's what you wanted.

303
00:15:15,438 --> 00:15:17,520
Still got the best cup of coffee in town?

304
00:15:20,566 --> 00:15:21,820
Guess not anymore.

305
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,724
You shouldn't have come back.

306
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:32,756
Dan still thinks you tried to kill him.

307
00:15:32,856 --> 00:15:35,630
Yeah, well, like I told you on the phone, he's wrong.

308
00:15:35,728 --> 00:15:37,856
Dan doesn't care about what's right or wrong.

309
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:39,346
He cares about winning.

310
00:15:39,427 --> 00:15:41,182
Well, don't worry about that.

311
00:15:41,335 --> 00:15:44,627
I'm gonna see Dan, and I'm gonna straighten things out.

312
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,309
He may be the mayor -- sorry about that, by the way --

313
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:49,893
but I'm still his big brother.

314
00:15:52,176 --> 00:15:55,775
You know, I thought about you every day I was gone.

315
00:15:56,066 --> 00:16:00,131
And you're even prettier than I remembered.

316
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,209
What?

317
00:16:11,381 --> 00:16:13,325
Too good to clean like everybody else?

318
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:15,130
Yes.

319
00:16:15,236 --> 00:16:16,735
What is your problem, anyway?

320
00:16:16,896 --> 00:16:20,761
My problem is you and Whitey are both screwing up my shot at playing college ball.

321
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,432
What, you think no one else wants to play in college?

322
00:16:26,522 --> 00:16:28,703
No, I think I'm the only person who needs to.

323
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:31,965
With my grades, if I don't get a scholarship, I'll end up cleaning gyms for a living.

324
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:33,019
Yeah, right.

325
00:16:33,106 --> 00:16:38,171
Well, well, I see my captains are setting another stellar example.

326
00:16:38,257 --> 00:16:39,741
Get back to work.

327
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,572
Nathan!

328
00:16:59,308 --> 00:17:00,531
Well, well...

329
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,601
the booze hound returns.

330
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:05,331
Never thought you'd show your face around Tree Hill again.

331
00:17:05,416 --> 00:17:06,906
I guess you finally grew a pair.

332
00:17:07,011 --> 00:17:08,833
I always had a pair, Danny.

333
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,486
Just ask your wife.

334
00:17:11,086 --> 00:17:12,570
Hey, did you ever find Jules?

335
00:17:12,674 --> 00:17:14,744
I need an address to send her W-2's.

336
00:17:14,845 --> 00:17:17,392
I hear you think I tried to kill you.

337
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:21,704
Trust me, if I did...

338
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,149
you'd be dead.

339
00:17:23,249 --> 00:17:24,568
Oh, I doubt it.

340
00:17:25,126 --> 00:17:28,635
In fact, the attempt on my life has all the markings of a Keith Scott operation,

341
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:30,710
starting  with the fact it was a failure.

342
00:17:32,648 --> 00:17:36,347
You know, I should have run for this office a long time ago.

343
00:17:36,498 --> 00:17:39,401
With its privileges, I get access to things.

344
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:43,280
For instance, the official investigation into the dealership fire.

345
00:17:43,383 --> 00:17:44,787
It was ruled an accident.

346
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:49,772
But I know someone gave me a drugged bottle of scotch that night.

347
00:17:49,889 --> 00:17:53,822
So it stands to reason, whoever bought the bottle also set the fire.

348
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:05,212
I guess that means you.

349
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,629
Man buys booze. Call the FBI.

350
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:11,434
I haven't even started yet.

351
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:15,028
Well, you can't find something that's not there, Danny.

352
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:16,936
Like your heart, for instance.

353
00:18:17,979 --> 00:18:21,133
Oh... by the way...

354
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:24,046
you ever touch Lucas again...

355
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:26,352
you'll wish I killed you.

356
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:40,805
What the hell is this?

357
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,343
Why doesn't my key to the front door work?

358
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:43,411
Changed the locks.

359
00:18:43,487 --> 00:18:45,420
And the alarm code, so don't even think about it.

360
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:46,406
Funny.

361
00:18:46,503 --> 00:18:49,001
Almost as funny as a mother who deserts her son.

362
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,777
At least your father checks in on you.

363
00:18:50,918 --> 00:18:53,353
Mom's better off without you. So am I.

364
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,812
Really? Then why aren't you at practice?

365
00:18:58,173 --> 00:19:00,293
Whitey kicked us out of the field house.

366
00:19:00,546 --> 00:19:02,581
Now we gotta play in that crappy old gym.

367
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:03,461
Don't worry.

368
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,949
I'll get my people to figure out some health-code violation.

369
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,418
I don't even know why you care.

370
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,075
Because you're a high-caliber player, and you deserve the best.

371
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:12,129
You mean like Oak Lake Academy?

372
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:15,725
Yeah, mom told me they made an offer and that you kept it a secret from me.

373
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:18,083
It's nice to see your mother's still using her mouth.

374
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:20,552
There's a reason I didn't tell you about Oak Lake.

375
00:19:20,653 --> 00:19:22,801
If you play there, you're a small fish in a big pond,

376
00:19:22,887 --> 00:19:24,877
but at Tree Hill, you can shine for the Scouts,

377
00:19:24,954 --> 00:19:26,221
and that's been the plan all along.

378
00:19:26,315 --> 00:19:27,733
Dad, the plan's not working.

379
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:29,861
There are no Scouts, not with the way we're playing.

380
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:32,542
I can exert some leverage, get the offer back on the table. It's not to late.

381
00:19:32,624 --> 00:19:33,987
Dad, that's not the point.

382
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:36,766
The point is it should have been my decision, not yours.

383
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,311
You're absolutely right.

384
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:41,691
No one should determine your future but you.

385
00:19:41,843 --> 00:19:44,247
Not me, not your mom, not even your wife.

386
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:47,131
By the way, did she put on a little bit of weight?

387
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,787
You were wrong about Haley.

388
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:49,847
She's on the pill.

389
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:51,607
Oh, is that what she told you?

390
00:19:51,725 --> 00:19:53,040
That sounds like Deb.

391
00:19:53,587 --> 00:19:56,984
Well, you know what they say, "we marry our mothers."

392
00:19:58,676 --> 00:19:59,733
And trust me.

393
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:01,762
Don't take anything for granted.

394
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:14,227
How's it coming?

395
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:16,880
It's done.

396
00:20:18,647 --> 00:20:23,463
You know, uh, Andy could have probably hired a couple guys to do this for you.

397
00:20:24,854 --> 00:20:25,875
How is he anyway?

398
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,975
Andy?

399
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:29,608
Well, he's handsome, generous, wealthy.

400
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:31,551
Well, three out of three ain't bad.

401
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,655
Well, he wasn't the one for me.

402
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:36,779
Traveled halfway around the world and figured out

403
00:20:36,859 --> 00:20:40,027
that everything I ever wanted was here all along.

404
00:20:41,623 --> 00:20:42,676
You know?

405
00:20:44,884 --> 00:20:46,135
Yeah, I do.

406
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:49,870
Well, I should get to the café.

407
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:54,392
See you.

408
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:03,077
When's the last time you gave that car an oil change?

409
00:21:03,703 --> 00:21:05,236
I've been very busy.

410
00:21:05,624 --> 00:21:06,552
Busy now?

411
00:21:09,605 --> 00:21:11,308
So how was Brooke's letter of the day?

412
00:21:11,951 --> 00:21:12,848
Angry.

413
00:21:13,968 --> 00:21:16,182
Just reminded me of how much I hurt her last time, you know?

414
00:21:16,365 --> 00:21:17,490
That's understandable.

415
00:21:19,323 --> 00:21:21,402
You know, you want your relationship to move forward,

416
00:21:21,483 --> 00:21:23,325
at some point, you gotta let go of the past.

417
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:24,962
Start writing a new future.

418
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:29,281
Wait a second. Are we still talking about Brooke, or you and mom?

419
00:21:31,594 --> 00:21:32,530
Go long.

420
00:21:56,758 --> 00:21:59,611
So, considering the show's sold out and we don't have tickets,

421
00:21:59,696 --> 00:22:00,794
how are we supposed to get in?

422
00:22:00,894 --> 00:22:03,027
Oh, relax. Follow my lead.

423
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:07,352
No, Maurice, you're not hearing me. I said room-temp water for Matthew.

424
00:22:07,445 --> 00:22:08,115
She's with me.

425
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:11,127
Tell them to make it right, or I'm gonna crack some skulls.

426
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:18,072
Okay, how'd you know he wouldn't stop us?

427
00:22:18,158 --> 00:22:19,589
First rule of a rock tour --

428
00:22:19,678 --> 00:22:21,794
nobody knows what anybody else is doing.

429
00:22:31,003 --> 00:22:33,460
See that guy down there who's on two cellphones at one time?

430
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:34,873
Yeah, no, I'm with you.

431
00:22:34,964 --> 00:22:36,906
That's the band's manager. Go get him.

432
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:37,520
What?

433
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:39,857
I got you in here. The rest is up to you.

434
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,918
You can do this. Go.

435
00:22:51,828 --> 00:22:52,805
Look, I gotta go.

436
00:22:53,135 --> 00:22:55,267
Excuse me, my name's Peyton Sawyer.

437
00:22:55,352 --> 00:22:59,077
Um, I book a lot of bands for the club I work for,

438
00:22:59,161 --> 00:23:01,983
like, you know, Jimmy Eat World and I've gotten Fall Out Boy,

439
00:23:02,069 --> 00:23:05,012
and now I'm putting together this compilation CD --

440
00:23:05,094 --> 00:23:07,502
That sounds cool, but the label doesn't like

441
00:23:07,576 --> 00:23:09,672
the band to compete against themselves, you know?

442
00:23:09,764 --> 00:23:10,987
Record sales.

443
00:23:11,086 --> 00:23:13,979
Okay, but this would actually be really good for the band

444
00:23:14,073 --> 00:23:17,516
because all the proceeds are gonna go towards breast-cancer research.

445
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:20,581
And, besides, when have you guys cared about the label anyway, right?

446
00:23:22,097 --> 00:23:25,999
Men has a history of following their hearts and their own creative instincts

447
00:23:26,098 --> 00:23:29,418
I mean, look at their second album. The label wouldn't release "The Proximity Effect."

448
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:33,572
You guys just put it out yourself, and you were right. It was a great album.

449
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,152
Benefit album, huh?

450
00:23:36,231 --> 00:23:39,638
All right, I'll talk to the guys. No promises.

451
00:23:57,308 --> 00:23:58,667
You may enter.

452
00:24:03,054 --> 00:24:03,918
Is Haley home?

453
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:06,298
You mean the Haley that promised to get the hell out of here?

454
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:09,985
Whitey told me to tell you to get your butt back to practice.

455
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:13,018
Tell Whitey I'll be back when it's practice and not spring cleaning.

456
00:24:14,732 --> 00:24:15,439
Hey, wha--

457
00:24:21,896 --> 00:24:23,300
Did you think about it?

458
00:24:23,677 --> 00:24:25,581
Having a baby to stay together?

459
00:24:29,507 --> 00:24:31,724
Nathan, I am 17 years old.

460
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,289
We're still in high school.

461
00:24:33,397 --> 00:24:35,310
You and I are totally in limbo.

462
00:24:36,311 --> 00:24:38,348
No. I don't want a baby.

463
00:24:39,314 --> 00:24:41,338
You knew you weren't protected that night.

464
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:44,481
Well, first of all, it takes two, guy without a condom.

465
00:24:44,794 --> 00:24:48,299
Second, the only thing I was thinking about that night was being with my husband.

466
00:24:48,541 --> 00:24:51,862
The fact you think I was trying to trap you is really insulting.

467
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,216
Then why did you go off birth control?

468
00:24:53,311 --> 00:24:55,170
Because I was on tour and you weren't with me,

469
00:24:55,248 --> 00:24:58,341
and contrary to what you were thinking, I wasn't sleeping with Chris Keller.

470
00:25:00,859 --> 00:25:01,791
You know...

471
00:25:03,182 --> 00:25:07,413
I just promised myself the next time I have sex that I'd be in love.

472
00:25:11,077 --> 00:25:13,008
Well, I guess it's a good thing I'm in love.

473
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:23,231
I never said that.

474
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,501
You still should have told me, Haley.

475
00:25:25,597 --> 00:25:29,071
Told you what? That when you have sex, there's a risk of pregnancy?!

476
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:30,796
Haley, I know.

477
00:25:31,078 --> 00:25:33,725
You should have told me having sex turns you into an ass!

478
00:25:33,815 --> 00:25:36,020
Haley, what if something would have happened?

479
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:37,804
That would have changed our lives forever.

480
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,109
Like what, marriage?

481
00:25:39,203 --> 00:25:40,608
Oh, she's good.

482
00:25:40,715 --> 00:25:43,326
I know we're married! I'm talking about basketball, my career.

483
00:25:43,404 --> 00:25:46,677
Oh, okay, so let me get this straight -- you're the one with goals and dreams,

484
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:49,298
and the only thing I want, apparently, is you back.

485
00:25:49,383 --> 00:25:50,981
I'm not that desperate, Nathan.

486
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:52,322
Sounds ugly.

487
00:25:52,433 --> 00:25:53,833
I know.

488
00:25:54,089 --> 00:25:56,870
Makes me feel like I'm still living at home with my parents.

489
00:25:56,962 --> 00:25:59,347
Without the drinking and the death threats.

490
00:25:59,436 --> 00:26:01,617
And if you're so worried about it, then why didn't you stop us that night?

491
00:26:01,708 --> 00:26:04,381
It's just as much your responsibility as it is mine.

492
00:26:04,468 --> 00:26:06,808
You're right. It is my responsibility.

493
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,007
Let me see the pills.

494
00:26:11,019 --> 00:26:13,094
I can't believe you still don't believe me.

495
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:14,591
I can't believe it.

496
00:26:14,701 --> 00:26:15,675
Here.

497
00:26:16,707 --> 00:26:17,724
Take them.

498
00:26:17,821 --> 00:26:19,105
I don't need them anymore.

499
00:26:19,575 --> 00:26:20,496
Haley.

500
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:23,028
Your future as a basketball player is totally secure.

501
00:26:23,109 --> 00:26:25,224
Your future as my husband, not so much.

502
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,595
Second door slam.

503
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:40,605
You think they're gone?

504
00:26:40,726 --> 00:26:42,617
Unless she's coming back to kill him.

505
00:26:44,585 --> 00:26:46,422
I just wanted to have a special night with you

506
00:26:46,498 --> 00:26:49,022
to thank you for getting me into "Rogue Vogue."

507
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,284
What's "Rogue Vogue"?

508
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,636
The fashion show in New York.

509
00:26:53,725 --> 00:26:56,739
Hello, I know you sent my application in.

510
00:26:58,406 --> 00:26:59,829
Unless you didn't.

511
00:27:01,398 --> 00:27:03,485
But if it wasn't you, who else would it be?

512
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,925
I wish it was me. It sounds pretty cool.

513
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:09,102
I should know you well enough to do something like that.

514
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:12,995
Well, don't feel bad -- I guess I'm not exactly encyclopedia Luke-tanica.

515
00:27:13,065 --> 00:27:14,234
I thought it was you.

516
00:27:14,692 --> 00:27:17,540
You know, if you want to get to know each other better,

517
00:27:17,611 --> 00:27:20,186
we could always talk about those letters.

518
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:23,954
Or we could cut out my heart and you could stomp on it.

519
00:27:24,638 --> 00:27:27,470
Luke, it's embarrassing. You were never meant to read those.

520
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:30,555
Brooke... I love those letters.

521
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,929
The girl in them is so open and honest.

522
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:39,467
I don't know why it's so easy for me to get naked one way and not the other.

523
00:27:39,681 --> 00:27:40,738
I do.

524
00:27:41,332 --> 00:27:42,840
I hurt you pretty bad.

525
00:27:45,547 --> 00:27:47,398
I'm not gonna do it again.

526
00:28:11,964 --> 00:28:12,997
You're sure?

527
00:28:20,572 --> 00:28:23,151
Peyton, you were great back there.

528
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:25,854
Whatever happens, you should be really proud.

529
00:28:27,782 --> 00:28:29,416
Your mom would be, too.

530
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:32,449
Thanks.

531
00:28:33,756 --> 00:28:34,931
She was great.

532
00:28:35,099 --> 00:28:37,955
She's the reason I picked your parents to be your parents.

533
00:28:39,382 --> 00:28:42,875
The day you were born, it was 14 hours of labor.

534
00:28:42,975 --> 00:28:46,412
You kicked through the whole third trimester, but then you didn't want to come out.

535
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:49,326
You were stubborn even back then.

536
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:51,057
When you finally did,

537
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,523
the nurses took you away.

538
00:28:53,748 --> 00:28:55,652
That was the policy of adoption.

539
00:28:56,573 --> 00:28:58,064
But your mom was there,

540
00:28:58,738 --> 00:29:00,403
and she brought you back to me.

541
00:29:01,244 --> 00:29:03,576
She wanted us to spend some time together.

542
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:05,867
She was kind.

543
00:29:08,267 --> 00:29:10,362
Can I ask you about the cancer?

544
00:29:11,836 --> 00:29:13,263
I never had the surgery.

545
00:29:14,333 --> 00:29:15,623
I had chemo.

546
00:29:16,397 --> 00:29:17,828
It made me really sick,

547
00:29:18,489 --> 00:29:19,912
but the cancer went away...

548
00:29:21,244 --> 00:29:22,330
for a while.

549
00:29:23,914 --> 00:29:25,442
So what are you doing now?

550
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:28,643
I'm spending time with you.

551
00:29:34,425 --> 00:29:35,357
Hello?

552
00:29:37,392 --> 00:29:38,676
Seriously?

553
00:29:39,403 --> 00:29:42,126
No, you -- you won't regret it. No, I promise.

554
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:44,979
Okay. Thank you so much.

555
00:29:45,516 --> 00:29:46,681
Okay, bye.

556
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:51,787
- Nada Surf is in.
- Whoo!

557
00:30:11,735 --> 00:30:14,519
If you're here to get me back in that gym, you can forget about it.

558
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,048
Heard your fight with Haley last night.

559
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,115
Why don't you stop interfering with things that you know nothing about?

560
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:25,674
You know Brooke and I had a pregnancy scare?

561
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:29,174
Yeah, your future flashes in front of your eyes.

562
00:30:29,334 --> 00:30:31,935
Everything you've always planned on changes.

563
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:33,550
And for a second...

564
00:30:34,954 --> 00:30:37,307
it puts you in Dan's shoes.

565
00:30:39,098 --> 00:30:40,875
The team needs you back, Nate.

566
00:30:41,698 --> 00:30:45,014
You know, you and I aren't the only ones with futures riding on this season.

567
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:48,275
But if we get a streak going, if we take a run at state,

568
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:50,746
these guys will feel what it's like to win,

569
00:30:50,823 --> 00:30:54,953
and that's something that they will strive for long after high-school basketball is over.

570
00:30:58,556 --> 00:30:59,509
Think about it.

571
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:16,055
Thought I told you boys to kill all the cockroaches.

572
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:19,225
Whitey, you're practically begging me to come in and take this team away from you.

573
00:31:19,312 --> 00:31:23,436
Well, since you've lost every game you've coached, it would be a perfect match.

574
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:25,235
Go ahead, make jokes.

575
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,500
I hope you're laughing when Nathan transfers.

576
00:31:27,605 --> 00:31:29,922
Because I made a few calls, and we're out of here.

577
00:31:30,019 --> 00:31:32,249
You really think he'd play in a craphole like this?

578
00:31:32,345 --> 00:31:34,995
Come on, son. Time to go.

579
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:36,888
For you, maybe.

580
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,733
Get out of my craphole, Danny.

581
00:31:59,326 --> 00:32:01,987
You know, I should have told you about Jules when I found out.

582
00:32:02,175 --> 00:32:04,518
Ah, it wasn't your fault.

583
00:32:04,652 --> 00:32:06,331
We shouldn't have secrets.

584
00:32:09,754 --> 00:32:13,209
I saw you the day of the fire across the street, didn't I?

585
00:32:15,127 --> 00:32:16,626
Why were you here that day?

586
00:32:17,373 --> 00:32:18,189
Well, I, uh...

587
00:32:19,218 --> 00:32:20,933
I came back to see you.

588
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:26,636
Then I heard that you were on your way to New Zealand to be with Andy,

589
00:32:26,733 --> 00:32:29,896
so I did something I hadn't done for a long time.

590
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,147
I had a drink.

591
00:32:31,958 --> 00:32:33,604
Then I had a few more.

592
00:32:33,797 --> 00:32:35,615
Is that why you were buying the liquor?

593
00:32:36,071 --> 00:32:38,389
The one that Dan thinks is some kind of evidence?

594
00:32:38,502 --> 00:32:39,438
Yeah.

595
00:32:39,704 --> 00:32:43,263
After that, everything just... spun out of control.

596
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:45,292
And that's where Dan's half right.

597
00:32:45,452 --> 00:32:49,714
I was in a drunken haze, and I did have a broken heart.

598
00:32:49,794 --> 00:32:51,401
And I wanted revenge.

599
00:32:51,783 --> 00:32:55,369
So all my problems pointed right toward Dan Scott.

600
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:58,418
And so I, uh...

601
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:00,814
decided to kill him.

602
00:33:02,916 --> 00:33:04,400
But I didn't do it.

603
00:33:04,761 --> 00:33:05,931
What stopped you?

604
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,137
Deb.

605
00:33:23,814 --> 00:33:24,808
What are you doing?

606
00:33:25,607 --> 00:33:28,548
First, I'm gonna kill this bottle of scotch, and then...

607
00:33:29,526 --> 00:33:30,850
I'm gonna kill my brother.

608
00:33:33,004 --> 00:33:35,195
I can't let you do this, Keith.

609
00:33:35,495 --> 00:33:36,972
You're better than this.

610
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,191
It's the only way.

611
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,748
He'll never stop, Deb.

612
00:33:39,853 --> 00:33:41,486
This is not your war.

613
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,446
You know, Nathan's next, Deb.

614
00:33:44,803 --> 00:33:46,282
Nathan's next.

615
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,103
She, uh...

616
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,644
she came back later that night.

617
00:33:53,858 --> 00:33:56,284
Wake up... wake up!

618
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:59,274
Dan's in the hospital. He's been burned.

619
00:33:59,408 --> 00:34:00,515
What are you talking about?

620
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:02,923
Like you said, it was the only way.

621
00:34:03,356 --> 00:34:04,413
Deb, what did you do?

622
00:34:04,508 --> 00:34:07,249
It wasn't your war, Keith, it was mine.

623
00:34:11,485 --> 00:34:12,605
I drugged him.

624
00:34:13,795 --> 00:34:15,637
I set the dealership on fire.

625
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:26,143
But somehow, he got out. He's alive.

626
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:27,934
Did Dan see you?

627
00:34:28,711 --> 00:34:29,715
Did anyone see you?

628
00:34:29,838 --> 00:34:31,866
No, I don't think he remembers.

629
00:34:32,107 --> 00:34:33,608
Oh, god, what should I do?

630
00:34:33,729 --> 00:34:35,538
They'll think it was an accident.

631
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:38,511
Just let it go, Deb.

632
00:34:39,761 --> 00:34:43,712
I'll leave town again, and we'll both pretend nothing ever happened.

633
00:34:44,138 --> 00:34:45,145
Okay?

634
00:34:46,628 --> 00:34:47,718
It was Deb.

635
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:49,469
She did it.

636
00:34:53,156 --> 00:34:55,274
You're talking about murder.

637
00:34:55,457 --> 00:34:59,352
I can't believe that Deb would do this and that you would help her get away with it.

638
00:34:59,503 --> 00:35:01,199
Deb's been in prison --

639
00:35:01,495 --> 00:35:03,565
17 years with Dan.

640
00:35:04,098 --> 00:35:05,451
She's done her time.

641
00:35:07,228 --> 00:35:08,623
I don't know what to say.

642
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,615
Look, I know this is hard to take.

643
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,124
I made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I can honestly say

644
00:35:15,426 --> 00:35:17,843
that giving Deb a second chance isn't one of them.

645
00:35:29,172 --> 00:35:31,063
Cleans up pretty well.

646
00:35:31,186 --> 00:35:32,460
It's still a pit.

647
00:35:33,898 --> 00:35:34,808
See how it plays.

648
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,373
All right.

649
00:35:44,241 --> 00:35:45,749
You want to know how I did that?

650
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,992
Luck?

651
00:35:51,785 --> 00:35:53,023
It's a dead spot.

652
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,303
Forced you into it.

653
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:55,963
Found it when I was sweeping the floor.

654
00:35:56,845 --> 00:35:58,547
Just like the old Boston Garn.

655
00:35:58,653 --> 00:35:59,746
And the River Court.

656
00:35:59,865 --> 00:36:02,350
I know every square inch of that blacktop. It gives me an edge.

657
00:36:02,443 --> 00:36:03,559
It didn't last time.

658
00:36:04,701 --> 00:36:05,866
Just think about it.

659
00:36:05,969 --> 00:36:09,439
We map out this entire court, use it to our advantage...

660
00:36:09,635 --> 00:36:11,383
it's like the ultimate sixth man.

661
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,844
Peyton, you got these bands to play on the CD? That's incredible.

662
00:36:16,941 --> 00:36:19,273
Yeah, well, we still have a few slots to fill.

663
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:21,713
In fact, we're expecting an answer from one musician today.

664
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:22,680
Who's that?

665
00:36:23,192 --> 00:36:24,776
Haley James-Scott.

666
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,512
What do you say?

667
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:28,660
- I say, "hell, yes."
- All right.

668
00:36:36,726 --> 00:36:37,738
Hey, mom.

669
00:36:39,471 --> 00:36:40,520
Everything okay?

670
00:36:40,734 --> 00:36:42,040
Not for you.

671
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,824
Skills called looking for you the other night.

672
00:36:47,286 --> 00:36:49,986
You could at least do me the courtesy of tightening your alibi

673
00:36:50,068 --> 00:36:52,891
before you decide to check in to hotel Brooke.

674
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:56,845
You are almost 18 years old,

675
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:59,151
and I am almost 36 years old.

676
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:03,289
Now, if you do the math, I think it's pretty obvious what my concerns are.

677
00:37:03,394 --> 00:37:04,951
Mom, we didn't do that.

678
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,624
We're being careful, more careful than you know.

679
00:37:07,771 --> 00:37:11,007
It's more than being careful with the chemistry, Lucas.

680
00:37:12,775 --> 00:37:15,323
It's about being careful with your heart.

681
00:37:15,921 --> 00:37:17,632
Like you are with Keith.

682
00:37:20,222 --> 00:37:23,711
I know you're right, mom, and I get it.

683
00:37:24,748 --> 00:37:30,223
But... I mean, if you're always looking for reasons not to be with somebody,

684
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:33,674
then you'll always find them.

685
00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:37,039
And, I guess, at some point,

686
00:37:37,335 --> 00:37:40,248
maybe you should let go and...

687
00:37:41,652 --> 00:37:43,574
give your heart what it deserves.

688
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,553
I'm sorry.

689
00:37:56,939 --> 00:37:59,454
We lost two games, and my dad was making me crazy.

690
00:37:59,565 --> 00:38:04,032
You know, I am... really sick of hearing you say that.

691
00:38:04,564 --> 00:38:07,975
Here's an idea -- if you don't want to be like Dan, don't.

692
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,355
I don't know what hurts worse, Nathan --

693
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:13,782
that you think I was trying to trick you into having a baby with me

694
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:16,939
or that having one with me is, like, your worst nightmare.

695
00:38:17,034 --> 00:38:19,753
It's not like that. I'm just not ready for --

696
00:38:19,857 --> 00:38:21,564
Of course not. Neither am I.

697
00:38:21,936 --> 00:38:24,975
I would like to think that, if something happened, you and I could...

698
00:38:59,348 --> 00:39:01,015
Fall Out Boy's in.

699
00:39:01,248 --> 00:39:02,468
How great is that?

700
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:08,456
You should be bouncing off your artistically angry walls.

701
00:39:08,552 --> 00:39:09,574
Aren't you excited?

702
00:39:09,678 --> 00:39:11,280
Yeah, I am, but...

703
00:39:11,947 --> 00:39:14,896
I want you to be here when the album comes out.

704
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:19,544
I will be here, Peyton.

705
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:21,817
I promise.

706
00:39:26,719 --> 00:39:27,898
It was you, wasn't it?

707
00:39:28,445 --> 00:39:29,777
The dress I designed.

708
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:32,739
The one you made -- it got me into "Rogue Vogue."

709
00:39:33,157 --> 00:39:34,315
Why did you do it?

710
00:39:34,437 --> 00:39:37,446
You know the winner's almost guaranteed an offer to design their own line.

711
00:39:37,564 --> 00:39:40,976
Yeah, but why would you help me?

712
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:45,148
Because, despite issues of quality control,

713
00:39:45,376 --> 00:39:46,781
your clothes are good.

714
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:48,776
But if you're afraid to go --

715
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,264
Oh, no, I'm gonna go.

716
00:39:50,488 --> 00:39:54,485
And I'm gonna win. So, thanks, I guess.

717
00:39:56,847 --> 00:39:59,134
No, thank you.

718
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:22,178
I'm glad you called.

719
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:24,148
I have something to say.

720
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:28,444
We've known each other a long time,

721
00:40:28,546 --> 00:40:31,115
and every time that we have gotten close,

722
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:34,031
I have been stubborn and scared

723
00:40:34,127 --> 00:40:38,102
and have found ways to let things get between us.

724
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,708
And I... I can't let that happen again.

725
00:41:03,046 --> 00:41:04,033
Keith Scott?

726
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:06,762
Yeah?

727
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,080
Put your hands behind your head.

728
00:41:09,444 --> 00:41:10,773
What the hell is this?

729
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:14,646
You're under arrest for the attempted murder of Dan Scott.

730
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,392
You have the right to remain silent.

731
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,505
Anything you say can and will be used against you.

732
00:41:20,693 --> 00:41:22,440
You have the right to an attorney.

733
00:41:22,682 --> 00:41:24,428
If you cannot afford an attorney...

734
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:53,316
