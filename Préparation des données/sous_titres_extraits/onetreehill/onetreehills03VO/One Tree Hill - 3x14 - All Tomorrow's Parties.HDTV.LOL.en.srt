1
00:00:00,119 --> 00:00:01,622
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:01,714 --> 00:00:03,582
"Congratulations. Your designs have been selected

3
00:00:03,608 --> 00:00:05,951
to appear at this year's Rogue Vogue showcase."

4
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:09,185
It's like a competition for emerging fashion designers in New York!

5
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,655
It is my job to come up with a routine for the tournament.

6
00:00:11,729 --> 00:00:14,881
The tournament's the same weekend as Rogue Vogue. You'll be in New York City.

7
00:00:14,963 --> 00:00:17,438
You made me realize I was ready for you.

8
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:20,766
I love you, Brooke.

9
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,034
I want to be with you, not Peyton.

10
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:28,615
I need you to talk to me about your cancer.

11
00:00:28,712 --> 00:00:29,530
It's okay.

12
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:31,945
No, it's not okay.

13
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:35,082
Ellie? Ellie?

14
00:01:26,234 --> 00:01:30,642
I read a poem once about a girl who had a crush on a guy who died.

15
00:01:31,368 --> 00:01:35,221
She imagined him up in heaven with all the beautiful angels.

16
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,041
And she was jealous.

17
00:01:38,036 --> 00:01:39,576
Ellie is gone.

18
00:01:40,384 --> 00:01:43,553
I imagine her with the badass angels now,

19
00:01:43,775 --> 00:01:47,650
hanging out with them in their black leather jackets, causing trouble.

20
00:01:48,619 --> 00:01:50,355
But I'm not jealous.

21
00:01:50,881 --> 00:01:52,420
I just miss her.

22
00:01:54,892 --> 00:01:56,501
You ready to talk about her yet?

23
00:01:58,591 --> 00:02:01,237
I'm dealing with Ellie's death the way she would have wanted me to --

24
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:03,071
by really living life.

25
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,158
What better way than road-tripping to New York in this sweet ride

26
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,857
and then hopping on a plane nine hours later and flying to Charlotte?

27
00:02:11,956 --> 00:02:13,277
Ellie would have loved it.

28
00:02:13,393 --> 00:02:15,079
And Rachel is gonna hate it.

29
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:16,396
Win-win.

30
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,905
Are we on schedule, navigation girl?

31
00:02:19,146 --> 00:02:24,235
Well, yeah, except that we promised to switch seats once we hit Pennsylvania.

32
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:27,666
Hmm. So, H. James-Scott, what are you more excited about?

33
00:02:27,753 --> 00:02:30,473
The fashion show or the cheerleading competition?

34
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,714
Sharing a hotel room with Nathan.

35
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:34,932
You are so Brooke's roommate.

36
00:02:34,975 --> 00:02:36,005
Whatever.

37
00:02:36,662 --> 00:02:38,614
- Oh, slug bug!
- Ow!

38
00:02:46,771 --> 00:02:52,459
This year's Classic will not be a repeat of last year's debauchery.

39
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,588
There'll be an 11:00 curfew.

40
00:02:55,701 --> 00:03:00,112
That means there will be no late-night hot-tubbing,

41
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:03,944
no spinning the bottle, no truthing or daring.

42
00:03:04,285 --> 00:03:07,771
And that includes the chaperons.

43
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,246
Your mom playing grab-ass on the bus isn't as humiliating

44
00:03:16,325 --> 00:03:18,475
as Dan assaulting me in the locker room.

45
00:03:18,568 --> 00:03:19,396
Where is Dan?

46
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:21,286
Official mayor stuff in Tree Hill.

47
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:23,330
Probably planning an invasion of Raleigh.

48
00:03:23,836 --> 00:03:25,388
More pressure off you, then.

49
00:03:25,491 --> 00:03:27,242
Actually, I play better when Dan's there.

50
00:03:27,343 --> 00:03:29,282
What, some kind of twisted good-luck charm?

51
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,409
No, more like a gun to the head.

52
00:03:36,059 --> 00:03:37,257
Okay, my turn.

53
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,240
Oh, wise radio, what is gonna happen to me in New York

54
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,716
at the Rogue Vogue fashion show?

55
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:44,390
That was the first question you asked, and you can't ask the same question twice.

56
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:45,553
I didn't like my answer.

57
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,018
And it's not like only one thing can happen at a fashion show.

58
00:03:48,113 --> 00:03:50,264
Yeah, but it defeats the purpose of the radio game.

59
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:52,872
It's like magic eight ball -- you have to take the first answer.

60
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:55,310
Yeah, I didn't get a do-over when the answer to my question,

61
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,148
"what will happen with me and Nathan?" was "highway to hell", okay?

62
00:03:58,197 --> 00:04:01,066
Fine, I will accept that at some point this weekend

63
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:03,936
someone will pour some sugar on me.

64
00:04:04,084 --> 00:04:07,294
But my next question is, "what is Lucas thinking about?"

65
00:04:08,153 --> 00:04:09,912
Right now.

66
00:04:10,006 --> 00:04:13,715
# Torn between two lovers #

67
00:04:14,763 --> 00:04:16,036
Okay, new game.

68
00:04:16,312 --> 00:04:17,748
How about movie quotes?

69
00:04:17,861 --> 00:04:19,554
I'll go first. Um...

70
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:24,677
"if I ever start talking about these as the best days of my life, remind me to kill myself."

71
00:04:24,771 --> 00:04:26,293
"Dazed and confused."

72
00:04:26,525 --> 00:04:28,015
Oh, my god, you guys. Look!

73
00:04:29,774 --> 00:04:30,703
Whoa!

74
00:04:31,003 --> 00:04:33,141
Oh, it's just like the movies.

75
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:35,244
Where's the iPod? Plug in the iPod.

76
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,074
Cue the soundtrack.

77
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:49,102
All right, girls, one hour to check-in.

78
00:04:49,198 --> 00:04:53,826
Everyone, assembled for practice at 3:00, break at 6:00, final rehearsal, 8:30.

79
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:54,681
Lights out at 10:00.

80
00:04:54,784 --> 00:04:56,222
You know, Brooke was never this strict.

81
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:59,040
She let us do what we wanted before the competition.

82
00:04:59,142 --> 00:05:01,058
Do I look like Brooke to you?

83
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:02,231
Thank god no.

84
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:04,122
Well, I don't feel good.

85
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:08,563
I'm gonna go try to squeeze in a nap.

86
00:05:15,468 --> 00:05:18,983
How stinkin' great is this?

87
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:21,102
Thanks for coming with me, team.

88
00:05:24,227 --> 00:05:26,408
Guys, guys, this is Rogue Vogue, not prom.

89
00:05:26,505 --> 00:05:29,663
Would you please get rid of those astoundingly repulsive streamers

90
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:31,203
before  I hang you by them?

91
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:32,892
- Um, hi.
- Hi.

92
00:05:33,153 --> 00:05:35,947
Excuse me. I'm Brooke Davis, and I just wanted to check on my time.

93
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:39,188
We're trying to hop a flight tonight back to North Carolina

94
00:05:39,269 --> 00:05:40,542
for a cheerleading competition tomorrow.

95
00:05:40,628 --> 00:05:43,144
My two best friends drove down with me, and I'm in love with them for it,

96
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:46,437
- but we want to fly back together-- 
- You know, the schedule has changed.

97
00:05:47,636 --> 00:05:49,444
Okay. Good change or bad change?

98
00:05:50,739 --> 00:05:52,703
Your clothes don't show until tomorrow.

99
00:05:53,871 --> 00:05:55,131
That's a bad change.

100
00:05:55,237 --> 00:05:57,410
Yeah. Looks like you have a cheer-cision to make.

101
00:05:59,093 --> 00:06:00,006
Well...

102
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:05,982
I cannot believe that director lady. I hate her.

103
00:06:06,085 --> 00:06:08,556
She was wearing white, and it is way after veterans day.

104
00:06:08,656 --> 00:06:09,539
Labor day.

105
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:11,170
Whatever,  almanac girl.

106
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:13,894
What am I gonna do? Could we get me a radio so I can make up my mind?

107
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:16,315
Okay, Donatella, get yourself together.

108
00:06:16,644 --> 00:06:20,612
You've never worked so hard at anything in your life except your fake I.D.

109
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:22,254
It's your big chance!

110
00:06:26,355 --> 00:06:27,803
You guys should go without me.

111
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,033
Are you sure?

112
00:06:29,452 --> 00:06:30,270
Yeah.

113
00:06:30,374 --> 00:06:31,296
Peyton's right.

114
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,610
It's my big shot.

115
00:06:32,915 --> 00:06:36,163
So just go before I change my mind.

116
00:06:36,812 --> 00:06:38,073
Have fun.

117
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,264
Good luck.

118
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:53,897
Oh, wow. Keith.

119
00:06:59,757 --> 00:07:01,424
These are gorgeous.

120
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,070
And  you should see the view.

121
00:07:04,515 --> 00:07:07,623
Oh, and the bathroom, it comes with one of those...

122
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:10,835
Crusty old men?

123
00:07:10,935 --> 00:07:14,043
Oh, that jacuzzi's gonna do wonders for my back.

124
00:07:14,786 --> 00:07:16,712
Whitey, what are you doing in our room?

125
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:18,457
Don't you mean our room?

126
00:07:18,786 --> 00:07:22,448
Oh, the two of you shacked up together in sin -- that's a bad example for the children.

127
00:07:22,546 --> 00:07:24,270
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

128
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:25,295
But, uh...

129
00:07:25,338 --> 00:07:28,167
Don't worry, Karen. I'll take good care of him.

130
00:07:28,512 --> 00:07:30,217
Well, what have we got here?

131
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,042
Mmm!

132
00:07:32,497 --> 00:07:33,885
Truffles.

133
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:36,524
Isn't that romantic?

134
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,604
Paper covers rock.

135
00:07:55,849 --> 00:07:56,926
Two out of three?

136
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:03,128
Room service.

137
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,001
Wrong room. Sorry.

138
00:08:05,117 --> 00:08:08,255
Man, if you don't come open up this door before I kick it down...

139
00:08:12,649 --> 00:08:13,697
Big time.

140
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:15,699
Tony Battle. What are you doing here, man?

141
00:08:15,799 --> 00:08:17,298
I live in the town next over, man.

142
00:08:17,402 --> 00:08:20,523
So now I get to beat your ass in a tournament, not just one-on-one.

143
00:08:20,878 --> 00:08:22,436
Well, hey, man, this is Lucas.

144
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:23,440
What's up, man?

145
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:24,385
Heard about you.

146
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,622
Jump shooter, right?

147
00:08:25,722 --> 00:08:27,591
Went to see Nate's girl, lied about it?

148
00:08:27,683 --> 00:08:28,896
Oh, god.

149
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,800
So I know you're all down to kick it tonight, right?

150
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:35,060
Uh, I don't know if we can do a wild night, man. We got a curfew.

151
00:08:35,157 --> 00:08:37,674
Okay. Cool. So then we'll make it an early wild night.

152
00:08:37,778 --> 00:08:39,179
Get your stuff. Let's roll.

153
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,403
Bevin, let me in.

154
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,816
I can't. I have an enormous fever.

155
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:52,773
You're gonna have to stay with someone else.

156
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:58,934
Thanks for driving up for the weekend.

157
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:00,459
Damn, baby, you look hot.

158
00:09:00,573 --> 00:09:02,373
Oh, no, I don't really have a fever.

159
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:03,897
That was a lie.

160
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:22,088
Hi. Excuse me.

161
00:09:22,464 --> 00:09:24,084
It's just a little crazy in here.

162
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:26,786
Um, I'm looking for the model for my clothes. I'm a designer.

163
00:09:26,888 --> 00:09:28,929
My name's Brooke Davis. I have --

164
00:09:29,405 --> 00:09:30,892
I'm your model.

165
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,020
Solaris.

166
00:09:32,127 --> 00:09:33,539
Solaris? Cool!

167
00:09:33,654 --> 00:09:35,602
Um, sorry I'm a little overwhelmed.

168
00:09:35,699 --> 00:09:38,051
I'm still in high school, and this is all really new to me.

169
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:39,956
Oh, I know. Everyone here is like 30.

170
00:09:40,065 --> 00:09:42,310
I am literally half their age.

171
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,212
So you're 15 or just really bad at math, like me?

172
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,341
Both.

173
00:09:47,477 --> 00:09:50,584
I'm really bad at math and 15.

174
00:09:50,737 --> 00:09:52,217
I thought you were like 25.

175
00:09:52,326 --> 00:09:54,264
Yeah, you and every bartender in the city.

176
00:09:54,382 --> 00:09:55,326
Nice.

177
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:59,276
I am really excited that there's another kid here, though.

178
00:09:59,309 --> 00:10:00,829
I totally miss my friends already.

179
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:02,244
You should be psyched.

180
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:05,727
Your line is so awesome. I would actually wear it.

181
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,893
Like, my friend Jessica has to model a shirt made of tacks.

182
00:10:09,006 --> 00:10:10,095
Ouch.

183
00:10:11,673 --> 00:10:13,241
Do you have plans tonight?

184
00:10:14,892 --> 00:10:16,244
Well, you do now.

185
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:19,310
Get for ready for a wild night, designer Brooke.

186
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:22,717
You took me to some pretty wild parties this summer, Battle,

187
00:10:22,813 --> 00:10:24,967
but I think you're outdoing yourself here.

188
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,745
Hey, you'll see.

189
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:34,839
He don't look like he got game.

190
00:10:40,371 --> 00:10:42,507
Bevin, quit making an "L" before you do that move.

191
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,658
It's the only way I can remember it's left and not right.

192
00:10:44,792 --> 00:10:48,188
Well, stop. It looks like you're making the "loser" sign.

193
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:54,648
Hey, you guys, I'm sorry we're late.

194
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:56,990
Oh. Thank god you guys are here.

195
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:58,531
Where's Brooke?

196
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,966
Um, Brooke got delayed at the fashion show. She's not coming.

197
00:11:03,078 --> 00:11:05,231
We'll just have to forge ahead without her.

198
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,079
All right, team. Everyone to your rooms. Let's get some rest for tomorrow.

199
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:11,158
Got to rest! So sleepy. Bye.

200
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:15,718
Oh, hey, give me a call if you need anything at all, okay?

201
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:16,761
Thanks, Haley.

202
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:20,520
I know you're excited about spending time with Nathan, so don't worry about me.

203
00:11:21,441 --> 00:11:22,641
Okay.

204
00:11:24,068 --> 00:11:26,957
Well, look, um, I'm not much of a listener,

205
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,661
but I do have some tequila in my room.

206
00:11:28,764 --> 00:11:29,664
You interested?

207
00:11:29,774 --> 00:11:31,097
Perfect.

208
00:11:49,493 --> 00:11:51,172
Solaris, I love you.

209
00:11:51,321 --> 00:11:52,834
You look fantastic.

210
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,058
Oh, this is Brooke Davis. I'm modeling her line tomorrow.

211
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:57,455
Do you have a cigarette?

212
00:11:57,571 --> 00:11:59,164
No. I quit.

213
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:00,834
Oh, you bitch. Love you.

214
00:12:04,592 --> 00:12:05,699
It's sad.

215
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:09,259
Ever since she got a rib taken out a year ago and those horrible collagen lip injections,

216
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:11,057
she's totally washed up.

217
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:12,237
Cheers.

218
00:12:18,523 --> 00:12:21,277
Kind of weird, us hanging out.

219
00:12:21,518 --> 00:12:24,938
Nothing personal. I just never imagined the two of us kicking it.

220
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:28,345
Well, we probably have a lot more in common than you think.

221
00:12:28,441 --> 00:12:31,494
Then again, we'll probably never get the chance to find out.

222
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:35,029
I mean, I'm not Brooke's favorite person, and you are.

223
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,841
She just doesn't trust you.

224
00:12:37,709 --> 00:12:38,762
And you do?

225
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:40,475
Not really.

226
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:42,372
I just wanted a drink.

227
00:12:48,138 --> 00:12:49,371
Hey, it's Bevin.

228
00:12:49,483 --> 00:12:52,892
Peyton's not in her room right now, unlike me, who's, like, totally asleep.

229
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:55,441
Anyway, if you see her, will you tell her she's bunking with you?

230
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:56,930
Why?

231
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,186
Because Haley switched rooms with Lucas so she could be with Nathan.

232
00:13:00,282 --> 00:13:02,967
Now Lucas is in Peyton's room because Brooke's not coming.

233
00:13:03,063 --> 00:13:06,332
But, of course, we can't put a girl in with Lucas, especially Peyton.

234
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:08,804
So Lucas goes there, Peyton goes in with you.

235
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:12,106
Chelsea's staying with Ashley because I'm really sick.

236
00:13:13,316 --> 00:13:17,384
Long story short, Peyton's in with you, Lucas is alone in her room.

237
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,335
Okay, yeah, fine. I'll tell her.

238
00:13:19,451 --> 00:13:22,794
Oh, and, uh, tell Skills hi for me.

239
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:24,989
What's up?

240
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:29,613
Oh, Bevin wants me to remind you to bring your flatiron to her in the morning.

241
00:13:31,593 --> 00:13:32,865
Rachel says hey.

242
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,535
Wait a minute.

243
00:13:35,675 --> 00:13:36,714
Oh, well.

244
00:13:36,821 --> 00:13:38,152
You ready for a swim?

245
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,225
Yeah. The jacuzzi looking real good.

246
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,857
Well, let's swim first.

247
00:13:42,145 --> 00:13:44,147
No, I'm -- I'm good.

248
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,731
Skills, come on.

249
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:48,621
Oh, my god.

250
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,391
Do you not know how to swim?

251
00:13:50,503 --> 00:13:52,560
What the hell kind of question is that?

252
00:13:52,656 --> 00:13:54,250
Do I not know how to swim?

253
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:55,772
It's 'cause I'm black, huh?

254
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,099
So you think all black people are just scared of water?

255
00:13:58,226 --> 00:13:59,634
I'm so sorry.

256
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:01,509
Of course you can swim.

257
00:14:01,610 --> 00:14:04,206
Actually, I can't, but... you know.

258
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,583
Well, I'm getting in.

259
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,971
Swimming, huh?

260
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:15,330
Well, how hard can it be?

261
00:14:19,253 --> 00:14:21,553
Damn, baby, you smell like a candy shop or something.

262
00:14:21,665 --> 00:14:22,929
Vanilla body spray.

263
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:24,604
Sparkle Classic swag bag.

264
00:14:24,718 --> 00:14:27,093
You sure you want to wash off all that sweetness, baby?

265
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:28,626
We can go somewhere and just stay dry.

266
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,811
Skills, come on.

267
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,194
You have to trust me.

268
00:14:32,282 --> 00:14:34,419
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

269
00:14:34,546 --> 00:14:35,992
Do you remember when we saw "Titanic"?

270
00:14:36,773 --> 00:14:38,421
"I'll never let you go."

271
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:39,919
That's easy for you to say.

272
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:42,836
'Cause the girl lived, but the dude...

273
00:14:43,804 --> 00:14:44,969
his ass drowned.

274
00:14:46,338 --> 00:14:47,507
Come on.

275
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,493
This food looks amazing, Mrs. Battle.

276
00:14:51,592 --> 00:14:52,995
Well, I hope you boys are hungry.

277
00:14:53,091 --> 00:14:55,534
If you're anything like Tony, that's not gonna be a problem.

278
00:14:55,624 --> 00:14:56,542
Mom!

279
00:14:57,505 --> 00:15:00,502
Nathan, we say grace in this house.

280
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:01,625
Oh, I'm sorry.

281
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,841
Oh, that's okay.

282
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,870
Aliyah, would you like to say grace?

283
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,703
Thank you, dear god, for the lasagna.

284
00:15:09,398 --> 00:15:11,760
Thank you also for sending Lucas here

285
00:15:11,872 --> 00:15:16,525
and having him sit next to me 'cause he is really, really fine.

286
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,056
Now, that was heartfelt. Let's eat.

287
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:22,741
Best grace ever.

288
00:15:24,177 --> 00:15:26,895
So, pops... I was telling these guys I'm gonna have to

289
00:15:26,955 --> 00:15:28,985
light them up in the Classic tomorrow night.

290
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:32,533
Well, you know who holds the all-time record for points in the Classic?

291
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:33,961
All right, here we go.

292
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,066
You played ball, Mr. Battle?

293
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:37,250
Son, I lit 'em up in high school.

294
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,748
That's cool. What happened?

295
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:39,896
Life  happened.

296
00:15:40,005 --> 00:15:41,049
I had this knucklehead.

297
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,406
Hey, man.

298
00:15:42,517 --> 00:15:46,217
Was  it hard letting go and wondering what might have been?

299
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:47,277
Not really.

300
00:15:47,369 --> 00:15:50,912
At a certain point, it's not about what might have been, but what might be.

301
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:54,716
On the drive out, did you see all those guys hanging out on the street corners --

302
00:15:54,806 --> 00:15:56,935
just  them and what might have been?

303
00:15:57,042 --> 00:15:59,698
Honey, do you need me to get you your soapbox,

304
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:01,742
or are you doing okay from your seat?

305
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:03,388
Let's hear about you two.

306
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:04,844
What's your father do?

307
00:16:05,031 --> 00:16:07,877
Well, he hangs out with what might have been.

308
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:10,234
Well, it's a tough thing,

309
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:13,332
but I bet deep down, he wishes the best for both of you --

310
00:16:13,437 --> 00:16:17,935
a good education and the hope that you'll find your way.

311
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:19,957
That's what every father hopes for his child.

312
00:16:20,058 --> 00:16:20,914
Not yours.

313
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:22,646
Whoa. Fall back, little man.

314
00:16:22,771 --> 00:16:25,535
My youngest son is referring to the father I never knew,

315
00:16:25,648 --> 00:16:29,074
but I bet somewhere out there he is thinking the same thing.

316
00:16:29,229 --> 00:16:30,927
That's what fathers do.

317
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:39,258
Ready to hit the lanes?

318
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:43,199
Uh... I kind of had plans, Whitey.

319
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,908
You disappear for four months,

320
00:16:47,008 --> 00:16:50,396
and then you can't find the time to take an old man bowling.

321
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:51,433
I...

322
00:16:56,704 --> 00:16:57,813
Go ahead.

323
00:16:57,959 --> 00:16:59,471
You two have a great time.

324
00:16:59,654 --> 00:17:00,810
Thanks, Karen.

325
00:17:01,686 --> 00:17:03,004
Carry that, will you?

326
00:17:11,901 --> 00:17:14,113
Hey, Travis, have you seen Solaris? I lost her.

327
00:17:14,206 --> 00:17:15,366
She's in the V.I.P. room.

328
00:17:15,466 --> 00:17:16,767
No. I was just in there.

329
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:19,694
Not that one. The real V.I.P. room.

330
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,040
Upstairs.

331
00:17:28,182 --> 00:17:29,167
Solaris?

332
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,138
Solaris?

333
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,627
Brooke?

334
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:42,778
Are you okay?

335
00:17:44,896 --> 00:17:48,794
I just snorted too much "H." I'll be fine in a minute.

336
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,482
As in heroin?

337
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,250
Oh, look.

338
00:17:56,495 --> 00:17:59,212
The princess fell off her pony.

339
00:18:00,873 --> 00:18:02,187
Is she okay?

340
00:18:02,304 --> 00:18:04,895
She's more than okay, sweetie. Trust me.

341
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,812
You're so pretty.

342
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:08,085
Isn't she?

343
00:18:09,802 --> 00:18:11,965
Whoa. Hey. I'm only 17.

344
00:18:12,065 --> 00:18:14,200
Didn't know you were so old, sweetie.

345
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,966
I thought you were more Solaris' age.

346
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,694
That's disgusting.

347
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:19,869
Watch yourself, little girl.

348
00:18:20,007 --> 00:18:21,963
You're swimming in the deep end now.

349
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:43,770
That's a nice jacket.

350
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,093
I had one like it once that I got from this vintage store

351
00:18:46,204 --> 00:18:49,101
but left it at this guy's house one night.

352
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,949
Loved the jacket, hated the guy.

353
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,752
So I never went back for it.

354
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:56,346
It was my birth mother's.

355
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,990
Yeah. I heard about that.

356
00:18:59,619 --> 00:19:00,637
Sucks.

357
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:02,278
Yeah.

358
00:19:07,981 --> 00:19:11,639
I'm sorry. I'm not so good at the shoulder-to-lean-on thing.

359
00:19:11,726 --> 00:19:13,646
You're in luck. I'm not looking for one.

360
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:16,956
I am, on the other hand, looking for another drink.

361
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,148
Works for me.

362
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:20,526
Try this. I call it "sympathy."

363
00:19:20,639 --> 00:19:21,728
Hey, well.

364
00:19:22,003 --> 00:19:23,668
Here's to sympathy.

365
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,925
For the devil.

366
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,222
Uh-oh. Someone is in trouble.

367
00:19:36,013 --> 00:19:38,136
Why? It's not even past curfew.

368
00:19:38,237 --> 00:19:41,720
Oh, Haley, uh... you're always such trouble.

369
00:19:41,816 --> 00:19:43,571
Oh, my god. You thought I was Keith.

370
00:19:43,696 --> 00:19:45,704
Okay. Um, Nathan's M.I.A.

371
00:19:45,788 --> 00:19:48,289
I just thought I'd stop by for a girls' night in with pay-per-view,

372
00:19:48,376 --> 00:19:49,744
but if you've got big plans...

373
00:19:49,851 --> 00:19:52,919
No, of course, of course. Get in here.

374
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:55,266
You sure?

375
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:56,743
I'd love the company.

376
00:19:57,778 --> 00:20:01,279
All right, um... movie guide.

377
00:20:01,856 --> 00:20:03,919
Romance, adventure.

378
00:20:04,031 --> 00:20:05,669
Nothing too scary.

379
00:20:05,845 --> 00:20:08,598
Yeah, I can't really watch scary movies anyway.

380
00:20:08,717 --> 00:20:11,363
Oh, I could totally be down for John Cusack -- "Must love dogs."

381
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:13,092
Oh, yeah.

382
00:20:13,382 --> 00:20:15,240
That means you want to watch it, right?

383
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:16,580
Yeah!

384
00:20:16,687 --> 00:20:19,103
- I love Diane Lane.
- Me too.

385
00:20:19,406 --> 00:20:21,630
Did you see her in "A walk on the moon"?

386
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:29,876
"Must love" -- oh, I missed an "N." I thought it said "dogs." I'm sorry.

387
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:31,254
We can't watch that.

388
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,857
What do you got, big time? I got you, buddy. Shot.

389
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,371
Oh!

390
00:20:36,917 --> 00:20:39,636
Wait. Now, don't shame me out there, son!

391
00:20:39,745 --> 00:20:41,176
"T" is getting schooled!

392
00:20:42,209 --> 00:20:45,004
Man, you see I have the home-court disadvantage here?

393
00:20:45,218 --> 00:20:46,798
My whole family, man.

394
00:20:52,279 --> 00:20:55,353
Uh, I'm not sure blue's my color, Aliyah.

395
00:20:55,483 --> 00:20:58,419
Trust me. It brings out your eyes.

396
00:20:58,978 --> 00:21:01,816
Come on, A.J. Let's school these two. Come on.

397
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,000
Okay, now we got a game.

398
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:07,050
Me and my man. All right? Me and my man.

399
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:09,123
Let's go, let's go.

400
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:13,508
And how is the most beautiful girl in New York City doing?

401
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,470
Oh, that hurts.

402
00:21:15,716 --> 00:21:16,804
Doing great.

403
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:20,611
But I miss you so much.

404
00:21:21,931 --> 00:21:23,715
I miss you too, baby girl.

405
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,535
You must be having the greatest time, huh?

406
00:21:25,657 --> 00:21:27,529
Yeah, it's crazy!

407
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:32,622
Listen, I got to go, but I can't wait to see you.

408
00:21:32,742 --> 00:21:33,957
I love you, babe.

409
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:35,903
I love you, too.

410
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:41,197
Show him your moves, baby. Show him your moves.

411
00:21:41,326 --> 00:21:42,092
I got him.

412
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:46,368
What's the matter? Too low to grab the ball? Got a bad back, old man?

413
00:21:52,465 --> 00:21:54,476
A.J., that's my baby.

414
00:21:54,702 --> 00:21:57,718
When you finish your makeover, you should take over for me.

415
00:21:57,841 --> 00:21:58,791
I'm headed out, kids.

416
00:21:58,917 --> 00:22:01,148
All right, pop. Don't work too hard, man.

417
00:22:01,801 --> 00:22:03,907
- Ooh, love you.
- I love you, pop.

418
00:22:05,661 --> 00:22:08,236
Thanks a lot, Mr. Battle. Appreciate it.

419
00:22:08,338 --> 00:22:11,107
You got a great family, sir. You must be proud.

420
00:22:11,206 --> 00:22:12,324
I am.

421
00:22:12,477 --> 00:22:13,953
You boys go strong, now.

422
00:22:14,493 --> 00:22:15,457
Come on, sweetie.

423
00:22:17,861 --> 00:22:20,374
Battle, man, you have an awesome dad.

424
00:22:20,467 --> 00:22:25,314
Yeah. He could have played D1 ball but just ended up being a dad instead.

425
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:26,913
He's not bitter about it at all.

426
00:22:27,037 --> 00:22:29,766
No. My dad's in love with life, man.

427
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:32,678
I mean, we're doing good now, but when we were little...

428
00:22:32,802 --> 00:22:35,147
man, we came up broke as hell.

429
00:22:35,635 --> 00:22:36,599
What changed?

430
00:22:36,712 --> 00:22:39,462
Nothing. He just kept working the same two jobs.

431
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:41,691
He was happy then. He's happy now.

432
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,118
You know what he says?

433
00:22:43,241 --> 00:22:47,233
"Regret makes you old, and bitterness poisons the people around you."

434
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,782
Your father's a smart man.

435
00:22:57,704 --> 00:23:00,705
Um, excuse me, Mr. Cabdriver?

436
00:23:00,941 --> 00:23:02,157
What's your name?

437
00:23:03,297 --> 00:23:04,904
You can call me Daoud.

438
00:23:06,374 --> 00:23:08,782
Okay, I don't think I can call you "dad."

439
00:23:08,884 --> 00:23:11,077
No, "Daoud."

440
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:14,561
Sorry.

441
00:23:14,721 --> 00:23:15,733
Daoud.

442
00:23:17,539 --> 00:23:19,876
Would you mind doing me a favor and turning on the radio?

443
00:23:19,977 --> 00:23:23,384
I have some really important decisions to make.

444
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,538
Of course.

445
00:23:32,763 --> 00:23:34,865
Would you tell me what he's saying, please?

446
00:23:35,673 --> 00:23:39,450
It is the story of a young girl who is very sad.

447
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:43,388
She's torn between two men.

448
00:23:44,236 --> 00:23:49,651
One man is very rich and offers to take her away from her home

449
00:23:49,973 --> 00:23:52,290
and show her all the wonders of the world.

450
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,657
So why is she torn?

451
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,643
Because the other man...

452
00:23:59,089 --> 00:24:02,343
this man she's known all her life...

453
00:24:03,331 --> 00:24:05,005
she loves him very much.

454
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,593
Yeah.

455
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,998
See? It's not so bad, is it?

456
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:21,393
You want to try it by yourself?

457
00:24:21,486 --> 00:24:24,425
Actually, I'm not ready for you to let me go just yet.

458
00:24:24,522 --> 00:24:25,467
Okay.

459
00:24:25,599 --> 00:24:27,692
But we can go upstairs whenever you want.

460
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:30,594
You know, I am kind of tired from all this floating.

461
00:24:30,702 --> 00:24:33,281
Well, just so you know, there's only one bed.

462
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:35,206
I hope you're cool with that.

463
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:37,058
It's not a water bed, is it?

464
00:24:37,701 --> 00:24:38,488
Oh, God.

465
00:24:41,174 --> 00:24:43,653
So A.J. and I roughed you guys up tonight, huh?

466
00:24:43,778 --> 00:24:47,410
Yeah. You might want to wipe your eye shadow off before you start talking smack.

467
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:49,191
Nah. It's working for me.

468
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:54,080
I ate the food before saying grace.

469
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:56,258
How was I supposed to know?

470
00:24:56,354 --> 00:24:57,592
You're kidding, right?

471
00:24:58,236 --> 00:25:00,360
You always say grace before dinner.

472
00:25:00,545 --> 00:25:03,808
Granted, every time I did it, I was sitting at the counter at my mom's café,

473
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:07,084
and every time it was, "thank you for the chicken fingers."

474
00:25:07,194 --> 00:25:08,318
But still...

475
00:25:08,636 --> 00:25:11,497
Dinner for me was always a TV tray and whatever game was on.

476
00:25:11,604 --> 00:25:14,323
I guess we can both thank Dan for those solo dinners.

477
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:16,083
Well, then there's Chuck Battle.

478
00:25:16,197 --> 00:25:17,651
Never had a father in his life.

479
00:25:17,752 --> 00:25:20,299
One generation just changed everything.

480
00:25:21,573 --> 00:25:23,310
You could do the same with Haley.

481
00:25:24,488 --> 00:25:25,879
Look, I'll catch up with you inside.

482
00:25:26,121 --> 00:25:27,472
And do yourself a favor.

483
00:25:27,666 --> 00:25:29,969
Take a bath, dude. You stink.

484
00:25:31,064 --> 00:25:35,663
But I don't understand how you think you can trust, uh, Lucas this time around.

485
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:40,872
It's a long story that frankly paints me in a really bad light.

486
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,539
Hey, the meter's not still running, right?

487
00:25:44,656 --> 00:25:46,039
I shut it off when we parked.

488
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:49,713
But feel free to tip generously for my brilliant advice.

489
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,493
I just don't understand why I'm so sad

490
00:25:56,595 --> 00:26:00,554
when I'm so young and this great thing is happening for me.

491
00:26:00,651 --> 00:26:03,005
You have a lot of life ahead of you, you know?

492
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:06,063
So what are you saying? Why rush it?

493
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:11,054
I mean, I can be a fashion designer when I grow up. I don't have to be one tomorrow.

494
00:26:11,147 --> 00:26:13,492
No. I'm saying the opposite.

495
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,920
Time passes you by, young lady.

496
00:26:16,352 --> 00:26:21,121
You have a long life, and you can start by making it great right now.

497
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:25,056
My life would be very different if I could have the chance you've been given.

498
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,439
Would you rather drive a cab or design clothes?

499
00:26:28,706 --> 00:26:30,091
I see your point.

500
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:36,477
Thank you so much, Daoud.

501
00:26:36,794 --> 00:26:38,576
And good luck with everything.

502
00:26:38,819 --> 00:26:40,196
Here's, um...

503
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,907
here's triple the fare.

504
00:26:44,101 --> 00:26:46,760
You have a very generous heart, Brooke Davis.

505
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:51,260
Hey, what happens with that song --

506
00:26:51,747 --> 00:26:54,190
the one about the girl torn between two lovers?

507
00:26:55,577 --> 00:26:57,693
There's much happiness, I assure you.

508
00:27:35,341 --> 00:27:36,780
No cheerleading for you?

509
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:41,904
No, I guess not.

510
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:45,806
Well, if you do well in this show, there won't be time for things like that.

511
00:27:45,911 --> 00:27:47,396
You'll be the talk of the town.

512
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,684
It's just hard to let it go.

513
00:27:50,814 --> 00:27:54,179
There are designers here who have been struggling in the fashion world for years,

514
00:27:54,293 --> 00:27:56,722
and yet overnight, this could be the start of your career.

515
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,982
And the end of being a kid, right?

516
00:27:59,141 --> 00:28:01,665
Being a kid ends for all of us, Brooke. Trust me.

517
00:28:01,784 --> 00:28:06,092
Having an apprenticeship with Donna Karan and your own label makes things easier.

518
00:28:08,008 --> 00:28:08,903
Good luck.

519
00:28:20,584 --> 00:28:22,535
Yeah, very funny, Lucas.

520
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,759
Your ass is still sleeping on the floor.

521
00:28:29,155 --> 00:28:30,459
Surprise.

522
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:35,352
I switched rooms with Lucas. I don't have to sleep on the floor, do I?

523
00:28:35,984 --> 00:28:37,717
How'd you manage to switch rooms?

524
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:42,174
Well, believe it or not, Bevin "mastermind" mirsky arranged the whole thing.

525
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,723
Any room in there for me?

526
00:28:48,848 --> 00:28:51,003
I thought you'd never ask.

527
00:28:52,896 --> 00:28:55,870
Nathan! Oh, my gosh!

528
00:28:58,726 --> 00:28:59,794
Come here.

529
00:29:09,901 --> 00:29:12,478
And the stars are -- what are they doing?

530
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:19,274
They're... crying for what we could have had

531
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:20,080
Okay.

532
00:29:20,112 --> 00:29:23,951
No, I like that line. It reminds me of Luke -- of Jake.

533
00:29:24,526 --> 00:29:25,223
Jake.

534
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:27,008
Are you sure you don't mean Lucas?

535
00:29:27,103 --> 00:29:28,300
No.

536
00:29:28,754 --> 00:29:29,945
It's Jake.

537
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:32,144
Well, whatever you say.

538
00:29:32,582 --> 00:29:35,267
Okay, look. I have to go to sleep now, okay?

539
00:29:35,394 --> 00:29:38,709
But, oh, thank you. Thank you for hanging out with me.

540
00:29:38,837 --> 00:29:42,327
You're not the manipulative psycho I thought you were.

541
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:45,358
Well, enjoy.

542
00:29:45,555 --> 00:29:46,594
Good night.

543
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:12,005
Are you drunk?

544
00:30:13,699 --> 00:30:16,335
Are you wearing eye shadow?

545
00:30:18,925 --> 00:30:20,762
Working through the pain?

546
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:23,333
Kinda.

547
00:30:26,012 --> 00:30:28,551
Everything's gonna be all right, right?

548
00:30:31,802 --> 00:30:32,898
Yeah.

549
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:35,998
Yeah, it is.

550
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,374
Oh, god.

551
00:30:54,037 --> 00:30:56,300
How drunk was I last night?

552
00:30:56,488 --> 00:30:58,967
Drunk enough to puke six times.

553
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,153
Let me guess.

554
00:31:01,728 --> 00:31:02,811
Rachel.

555
00:31:02,949 --> 00:31:04,186
Yeah.

556
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:09,134
Rachel's probably not the best person to use the buddy system with.

557
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,270
I feel like you're always rescuing me.

558
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:15,738
Also, like there's a giant elephant standing on my head.

559
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:20,367
Yeah, well, I can't rescue you from the routine you have to do in three hours.

560
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,956
I'll wake you up in a half-hour.

561
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,189
Oh, god, this bed was so comfortable.

562
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:34,711
Ooh! That was attractive.

563
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,049
Room service?

564
00:31:37,219 --> 00:31:42,123
Actually... let's have a proper sit-down breakfast somewhere...

565
00:31:42,391 --> 00:31:43,820
family style.

566
00:31:44,692 --> 00:31:47,960
Family style sounds perfect.

567
00:31:54,318 --> 00:31:56,921
If it's the maid service, we're good. Thanks.

568
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:11,942
Brooke...

569
00:32:12,331 --> 00:32:14,895
I cannot believe I flew all the way back from New York for this.

570
00:32:14,987 --> 00:32:16,791
I am the dumbest girl alive.

571
00:32:16,915 --> 00:32:19,764
Brooke, don't freak out. Okay, look. Hey!

572
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:21,373
Peyton was drunk.

573
00:32:21,511 --> 00:32:23,730
She crashed in my room by accident.

574
00:32:23,853 --> 00:32:26,658
It wasn't her fault. Our rooms got switched.

575
00:32:26,754 --> 00:32:30,431
She didn't get the message. I slept on the floor.

576
00:32:30,608 --> 00:32:31,900
By the way...

577
00:32:32,954 --> 00:32:34,377
I'm thrilled to see you.

578
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,372
Come on.

579
00:32:37,018 --> 00:32:39,152
What did we say about trusting each other?

580
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:44,491
You know Peyton needs both of us right now.

581
00:32:56,202 --> 00:32:57,764
I missed you.

582
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,601
Well, well.

583
00:33:04,709 --> 00:33:06,766
Looks like somebody had a rough night.

584
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:09,054
Says the girl who poured drinks down my throat

585
00:33:09,148 --> 00:33:12,245
and then dropped me off in my best friend's boyfriend's bed.

586
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,349
Look, I just led you to the door, sweetheart.

587
00:33:14,452 --> 00:33:16,728
We're not giant pandas, you know?

588
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:19,590
You can't just put us together and expect us to mate.

589
00:33:19,684 --> 00:33:22,641
And do me a favor. Talk soft.

590
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:24,723
You've got a terrible voice.

591
00:33:24,886 --> 00:33:26,906
Look, I was trying to help you out.

592
00:33:27,047 --> 00:33:29,419
I'm sorry if it's not what you wanted.

593
00:33:29,532 --> 00:33:35,007
You know what? You can't see it, but underneath my sunglasses, I'm rolling my eyes.

594
00:33:36,884 --> 00:33:39,444
Huh! Speak of the devil.

595
00:33:39,564 --> 00:33:40,843
Look, don't take that.

596
00:33:40,939 --> 00:33:42,023
We have to get ready.

597
00:33:42,113 --> 00:33:44,009
Brooke is not a part of this.

598
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,241
You are so happy you're not me right now.

599
00:33:47,343 --> 00:33:49,085
You sound level-10 hung over.

600
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:51,348
Yeah, well, you should see me.

601
00:33:51,634 --> 00:33:54,098
Yeah, you look like ass, too.

602
00:33:54,517 --> 00:33:56,038
Brooke, what the heck?!

603
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,304
Hey!

604
00:33:57,946 --> 00:33:59,932
What about the fashion show?

605
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:03,241
I have the rest of my life for that stuff.

606
00:34:03,352 --> 00:34:05,797
Not so much to be 17 with my friends.

607
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:07,096
How sweet.

608
00:34:07,276 --> 00:34:12,043
Unfortunately, my routine only needs 9 girls, not 10.

609
00:34:12,168 --> 00:34:15,143
Which means you're gonna have to sit this one out, captain.

610
00:34:15,249 --> 00:34:17,031
Well, I think we can manage. Right, girls?

611
00:34:17,163 --> 00:34:17,860
Yes.

612
00:34:17,986 --> 00:34:18,913
Yeah.

613
00:34:20,361 --> 00:34:22,401
And watch me for the changes.

614
00:34:22,661 --> 00:34:24,735
Come on, girls. Let's stretch.

615
00:35:02,924 --> 00:35:03,960
You okay?

616
00:35:04,186 --> 00:35:05,550
You can't be out here with me.

617
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,943
No, it's okay.

618
00:35:07,137 --> 00:35:09,446
I talked to Brooke. She knows what happened.

619
00:35:09,554 --> 00:35:10,782
It's not okay.

620
00:35:11,029 --> 00:35:12,892
I mean, it is, but...

621
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:14,708
it's hard on Brooke.

622
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,876
I'll be fine.

623
00:35:20,499 --> 00:35:25,230
You know, Peyton, you can learn a lot from Ellie.

624
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:28,761
She struck me as tough.

625
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,099
Yeah. Yeah.

626
00:35:30,165 --> 00:35:31,431
And that's important.

627
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:32,933
But...

628
00:35:34,365 --> 00:35:37,480
I also think you can learn a lot from her mistakes.

629
00:35:37,783 --> 00:35:41,002
Don't live your life alone.

630
00:35:42,683 --> 00:35:44,133
Let us in.

631
00:36:11,108 --> 00:36:14,025
I'm still trying to figure out which was more fun last night --

632
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:19,125
sleeping on the floor or Whitey snoring the theme song to "M.A.S.H."

633
00:36:19,313 --> 00:36:20,463
Top that.

634
00:36:21,162 --> 00:36:22,662
Well, let's see, um...

635
00:36:22,768 --> 00:36:24,034
I took a bath.

636
00:36:24,175 --> 00:36:28,545
Uh, I hung out with Haley and watched an adult movie.

637
00:36:30,005 --> 00:36:34,106
Hmm. Haley is a bad influence.

638
00:36:35,406 --> 00:36:37,723
But most of all, I missed you.

639
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,272
Okay, Peyton, focus.

640
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:53,450
Brooke, try to keep up. And, Bevin, don't be an idiot.

641
00:36:53,501 --> 00:36:55,867
We're winning that trophy. All right, let's go.

642
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:57,669
One last thing, girls.

643
00:36:57,775 --> 00:36:58,882
Have fun.

644
00:36:59,183 --> 00:37:02,933
And next up in this year's Secret Sparkle Classic --

645
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,965
when you're strong, you sparkle --

646
00:37:05,068 --> 00:37:07,886
the Tree Hill Ravens cheerleaders.

647
00:37:34,174 --> 00:37:35,659
What are you doing here?

648
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:38,657
And what the hell do you smell like dessert for?

649
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:40,470
Vanilla body spray.

650
00:37:40,662 --> 00:37:43,056
Plus Bevin teaching me how to swim.

651
00:37:43,993 --> 00:37:45,591
Skills, you're the best swimmer I know.

652
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,165
Right. I swim-lessoned her, dog.

653
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,868
Had to get her back for notebooking me.

654
00:37:49,921 --> 00:37:51,033
You know.

655
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,101
Pick it up, Peyton. 

656
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,301
Can't help it. Someone got me drunk last night.

657
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:58,135
Go, Bevin!

658
00:39:33,416 --> 00:39:35,691
Solaris, you're wearingt wo different shoes, you moron.

659
00:39:35,795 --> 00:39:36,990
You might want to lay off the drugs,

660
00:39:37,059 --> 00:39:39,164
considering you don't have many brain cells to begin with.

661
00:39:39,223 --> 00:39:40,263
It doesn't matter anyway.

662
00:39:40,306 --> 00:39:42,424
Brooke Davis checked out this morning.

663
00:39:42,539 --> 00:39:45,305
Can you believe she walked away from all this?

664
00:39:51,511 --> 00:39:56,318
If the rest of my days are like this, I'm gonna die a happy man.

665
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:00,553
Marry me.

666
00:40:01,515 --> 00:40:03,648
You can't propose to me.

667
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:05,477
I was gonna propose to yo--

668
00:40:12,999 --> 00:40:18,028
I'm telling you, I did not order any... pornography.

669
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:22,519
Most of our life is a series of images.

670
00:40:23,145 --> 00:40:26,109
They pass us by like towns on the highway.

671
00:40:26,268 --> 00:40:29,434
But sometimes a moment stuns us as it happens

672
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:33,200
and we know that this instant is more than a fleeting image.

673
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:35,194
We know that this moment --

674
00:40:35,514 --> 00:40:37,165
every part of it --

675
00:40:37,674 --> 00:40:39,259
will live on forever.
