1
00:00:00,874 --> 00:00:02,539
Previously on "One Tree Hill"...

2
00:00:02,555 --> 00:00:05,438
My name is Elizabeth. I'm your mother.

3
00:00:05,919 --> 00:00:07,244
Is this woman my mother?

4
00:00:07,311 --> 00:00:09,682
Your mom is gone, Peyton.

5
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:13,020
But your biological mother is alive.

6
00:00:13,251 --> 00:00:14,566
Are you and Haley fighting?

7
00:00:14,643 --> 00:00:18,070
My problem is with anybody who just vanishes and then waltzes back in

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,250
and expects to be instantly forgiven.

9
00:00:20,316 --> 00:00:24,443
You know, we could totally have a summer-like fling, just in the fall.

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:27,142
And non-exclusive.

11
00:00:28,481 --> 00:00:30,939
There wasn't a moment when I was away

12
00:00:31,271 --> 00:00:33,387
that my heart wasn't with you in Tree Hill.

13
00:00:33,456 --> 00:00:34,598
I'm going to High Flyers.

14
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:37,131
Unlike you, I'm taking my heart with me.

15
00:00:37,889 --> 00:00:39,199
We're not brothers.

16
00:00:39,532 --> 00:00:40,797
We're not even friends.

17
00:00:40,884 --> 00:00:43,168
Three months ago, someone tried to kill me.

18
00:00:43,398 --> 00:00:46,639
And when I find out who did this to me -- and I will find out soon --

19
00:00:46,727 --> 00:00:49,635
the sins I commit then could turn this place to rubble.

20
00:01:07,472 --> 00:01:09,879
Henry David Thoreau once wrote,

21
00:01:09,987 --> 00:01:12,163
"Live each season as it passes.

22
00:01:12,265 --> 00:01:16,371
Breathe the air, drink the drink, taste the fruit,

23
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:20,252
and resign yourself to the influences of each."

24
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:23,053
Well, well. Look who's starting a fire.

25
00:01:45,699 --> 00:01:46,861
Rise and shine.

26
00:01:47,117 --> 00:01:48,295
Nice of you to knock.

27
00:01:48,366 --> 00:01:50,604
I didn't want to wake you, sleeping bitchy.

28
00:01:50,677 --> 00:01:52,498
Besides, I had to get the list ready.

29
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:53,589
What list?

30
00:01:53,769 --> 00:01:54,772
This list.

31
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:58,944
What is that exactly?

32
00:01:59,656 --> 00:02:02,550
Since you and I are both officially available again

33
00:02:02,601 --> 00:02:04,807
and tonight is the end-of-summer beach party -- which means

34
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:06,886
partial, if not total, naked nudity --

35
00:02:06,946 --> 00:02:10,274
I have made a list of all of the available guys,

36
00:02:10,346 --> 00:02:13,454
so that we can avoid the pain and hardship of another Lucas love triangle.

37
00:02:13,526 --> 00:02:17,307
You mean the Lucas that you're supposedly dating?

38
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:20,260
Okay, I'm sorry. I didn't get any of that.

39
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:23,173
Did you just say something about me puking at a rave?

40
00:02:23,803 --> 00:02:27,555
I said, "the Lucas you're supposedly dating."

41
00:02:27,617 --> 00:02:28,893
Non-exclusively.

42
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,480
- Huh.
- What "huh"?

43
00:02:30,535 --> 00:02:32,199
I have dated multiple guys before.

44
00:02:32,276 --> 00:02:33,429
Yeah, I know.

45
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,692
In fact, you are the queen of the multiple-boy dating scenario.

46
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,146
I'm just surprised you're doing it with Lucas.

47
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:43,786
You know what they say. When it comes to boys, I'm full of surprises.

48
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:45,649
But I thought you were the new, responsible Brooke.

49
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,042
Uh, so last season. Responsible Brooke is good, but party Brooke is gooder.

50
00:02:51,063 --> 00:02:51,927
Check it out.

51
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:55,250
I get Lucas, Mouth, half the guys on the team --

52
00:02:55,306 --> 00:02:57,543
I put my first choices here, but we can totally mix and match.

53
00:02:57,611 --> 00:03:01,398
Any and all lifeguards, Nathan's uncle Cooper -- so hot -- Larry.

54
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,850
Whoa! Larry like my dad Larry?

55
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:07,707
Of course! He's my hot-dad fantasy.

56
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:11,147
Peyton, he is a total dilf.

57
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:13,094
And, besides, I gave you Dan.

58
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,186
And I get Dave Grohl from the Foo Fighters.

59
00:03:17,737 --> 00:03:21,332
You get Jake, as promised, Nathan -- but he comes with an asterisk,

60
00:03:21,377 --> 00:03:24,716
because nobody knows what is going on with him and Haley in high school married limbo.

61
00:03:24,765 --> 00:03:26,896
The other half of the guys on the team, Anna --

62
00:03:26,948 --> 00:03:30,839
because, well, you never know, and she was totally into you.

63
00:03:30,896 --> 00:03:33,708
And all the river court boys -- Skills, Fergie, and Garbage.

64
00:03:34,224 --> 00:03:35,089
Junk.

65
00:03:35,937 --> 00:03:36,764
Right.

66
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,873
And, finally, the rest of the Foo Fighters.

67
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,223
Why do you get Dave Grohl? I want Dave Grohl.

68
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,013
No way.

69
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,121
So I get a fugitive and a married guy.

70
00:03:46,763 --> 00:03:49,646
Fine. You take Dave Grohl. I'm taking Anna.

71
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:50,869
- Deal.
- Deal.

72
00:03:50,936 --> 00:03:52,789
Okay. Nighty-night. Thanks. Bye.

73
00:04:05,409 --> 00:04:06,496
You're back.

74
00:04:07,944 --> 00:04:08,763
Maybe.

75
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:11,360
Maybe you're just high and seeing things.

76
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:16,291
So I guess you're still pissed at me, which, personally, I think is crap.

77
00:04:16,362 --> 00:04:17,381
But you tell me.

78
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,519
Are we friends?

79
00:04:19,414 --> 00:04:20,283
I'll tell you what.

80
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,885
I'll play you for it -- game to 11.

81
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:24,687
Make it, take it...

82
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,288
for our friendship.

83
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:24,315
Game.

84
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:28,743
Where are you going?

85
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:29,839
You lost.

86
00:05:30,592 --> 00:05:32,322
I guess that means we're still not friends.

87
00:06:32,536 --> 00:06:34,782
Hiya, new roommate. Getting all moved in?

88
00:06:35,079 --> 00:06:38,393
Uh, with the six feet that you gave me? Yeah. Sure.

89
00:06:38,453 --> 00:06:39,155
Good.

90
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:40,229
Thank you.

91
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,217
Hey,  great idea.

92
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:43,485
What?

93
00:06:43,605 --> 00:06:46,997
Wearing your wedding ring -- it's like a total aphrodisiac for some guys.

94
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:50,229
I just need it to be an aphrodisiac for one guy.

95
00:06:50,306 --> 00:06:51,725
Why? Do you have a new guy?

96
00:06:52,994 --> 00:06:54,560
For Nathan, Brooke.

97
00:06:56,933 --> 00:07:01,115
Hmm, I see. About him -- I notice you haven't unpacked.

98
00:07:01,248 --> 00:07:02,844
A little naive, don't you think?

99
00:07:02,913 --> 00:07:05,738
No. No, I'm just stalling.

100
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:10,992
I mean, it's like if I unpack, my split with Nathan will be more real.

101
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,727
I hate to say it, but it's real enough already.

102
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,451
Yeah, I know.

103
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,051
Okay. No, no, none of that.

104
00:07:20,116 --> 00:07:21,733
Come here. I have a surprise for you.

105
00:07:21,815 --> 00:07:23,208
Come on, come on. This will be fun.

106
00:07:24,381 --> 00:07:26,895
This is totally gonna cheer you up.

107
00:07:30,009 --> 00:07:30,955
Whoa!

108
00:07:31,614 --> 00:07:35,840
Wha-- this is amazing. When did you do this?

109
00:07:35,911 --> 00:07:37,340
Last night, while you were sleeping.

110
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:40,289
You totally sleep like a dead person.

111
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:41,420
Shut up.

112
00:07:41,974 --> 00:07:43,392
This looks awesome.

113
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,375
Thanks.

114
00:07:45,304 --> 00:07:48,896
By the way, I'm kind of gonna need to ask for next month's rent now,

115
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:53,226
'cause I sort of spent this month's rent on the couch and the rugs and things.

116
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:56,688
Okay, although you really shouldn't have to pay for this stuff yourself.

117
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:58,517
We're roommates now. I'll go half.

118
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,586
- Really?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:02,437
I  was hoping you'd say that, 'cause I kind of ate half your rainbow sherbet

120
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,506
last night while I was hanging the wall mural.

121
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:06,171
Where'd you get it, anyway?

122
00:08:06,241 --> 00:08:07,250
The freezer?

123
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:08,439
The wall mural.

124
00:08:08,561 --> 00:08:11,389
Oh, Peyton made it for me. It's the french riviera.

125
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:13,877
Gosh, I haven't talked to Peyton in, like, forever.

126
00:08:13,932 --> 00:08:16,877
Lucas filled me in on her mom situation. What the heck?

127
00:08:16,984 --> 00:08:21,613
Yeah, the mom situation's on high alert right now 'cause Ellie's back in town.

128
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,130
How's Peyton taking it?

129
00:08:23,508 --> 00:08:24,449
Well...

130
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:26,747
There she is now.

131
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:29,404
She's sending me a last-minute flyer for the party tonight.

132
00:08:29,514 --> 00:08:32,794
Speaking of which, you are not allowed to sulk tonight.

133
00:08:32,866 --> 00:08:33,937
I don't sulk.

134
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:35,822
You sulk. You're a sulker.

135
00:08:35,903 --> 00:08:39,102
But tonight, you're gonna have fun. After all, it's a party.

136
00:08:39,164 --> 00:08:42,538
It's supposed to be... dark and depressing?

137
00:08:42,893 --> 00:08:46,066
Well, you asked how she's taking it. There you go.

138
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,876
Hi, Peyton.

139
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:12,853
Last time I saw you, you were slamming a door in my face.

140
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:14,062
So let's have it.

141
00:09:14,456 --> 00:09:15,504
What's that?

142
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:20,692
The heart wrenching, yet inspirational tale of a young girl's complex decision

143
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,545
to part with the daughter she desperately loves.

144
00:09:23,761 --> 00:09:25,569
Actually, it's not that complex.

145
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:29,307
At the time I got pregnant, I liked drugs more than I liked you.

146
00:09:29,376 --> 00:09:30,348
That's it.

147
00:09:34,952 --> 00:09:36,908
I'm a different person now, Peyton.

148
00:09:37,497 --> 00:09:40,964
But those decisions are still mine. I can't change that.

149
00:09:41,036 --> 00:09:45,688
And what? So you -- you're just coming to make peace with yourself?

150
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,193
That is so screwed up.

151
00:09:48,255 --> 00:09:51,126
You can't just crawl out of your hole after 17 years

152
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:53,439
and cause a plague like some kind of locust.

153
00:09:53,517 --> 00:09:56,677
For what it's worth, I crawled out of my hole a long time ago.

154
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:00,624
Your father wouldn't let me see you.

155
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,958
I don't believe you.

156
00:10:06,271 --> 00:10:09,754
You used to sit under a bridge by the river...

157
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:16,133
you and a brunette girl who wore a little too much eye makeup for a 10-year-old.

158
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:23,884
She tried to see me...

159
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:26,931
like seven years ago, but you sent her away!

160
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:27,888
That's right.

161
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:29,752
How could you do that?

162
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:32,221
Because I'm your dad and it was my call.

163
00:10:32,388 --> 00:10:33,874
Unbelievable.

164
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:35,169
- Peyton.
- Forget it!

165
00:10:35,225 --> 00:10:36,058
Peyton!

166
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:42,496
Hey!

167
00:10:42,582 --> 00:10:45,352
I understand you're upset. But don't be slamming doors

168
00:10:45,425 --> 00:10:47,625
and stomping your little chicken ass around this house

169
00:10:47,677 --> 00:10:49,843
while I'm talking with you. I am still your father.

170
00:10:49,894 --> 00:10:52,531
But you're not my father, are you?

171
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:02,475
When Ellie gave you up, she agreed not to see you.

172
00:11:02,524 --> 00:11:05,647
Had your mother lived, we would have told you. It would have been up to you.

173
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:09,835
But when she died, I decided it would be too hard, too confusing for you.

174
00:11:09,843 --> 00:11:11,450
Maybe that was a mistake.

175
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,898
Maybe it was a mistake.

176
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:18,120
You know what, dad? This -- this is you, okay?

177
00:11:19,226 --> 00:11:21,387
Kind of a broken record lately, don't you think?

178
00:11:25,925 --> 00:11:29,566
You know, Peyton, one of these days you're gonna grow up

179
00:11:29,937 --> 00:11:32,488
and you won't have all the answers.

180
00:11:33,328 --> 00:11:36,517
You weren't even 10 years old when Ellie showed up.

181
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:40,137
She had a drug habit, she moved around a lot.

182
00:11:40,203 --> 00:11:42,149
It wasn't even a year after your mother had died

183
00:11:42,195 --> 00:11:45,706
and  you were in a pretty rough place emotionally.

184
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:48,672
And if you ask me, you still are.

185
00:11:48,728 --> 00:11:50,505
And guess what? So am I.

186
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:56,270
I could not risk exposing you to her.

187
00:11:56,342 --> 00:11:58,871
No way -- not then.

188
00:11:59,471 --> 00:12:01,882
Fine! Fine -- not then.

189
00:12:01,938 --> 00:12:06,383
Okay, but what about sometime in, oh, I don't know, the last eight years?

190
00:12:06,765 --> 00:12:07,953
What about then?

191
00:12:08,554 --> 00:12:10,996
Or, like, what about now?

192
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:13,514
I suppose now is up to you.

193
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:34,906
Hey, you.

194
00:12:35,332 --> 00:12:36,617
"Hey" back at you.

195
00:12:37,189 --> 00:12:40,830
1972's outside. It wants its furniture back.

196
00:12:40,918 --> 00:12:43,073
You mock, but you don't know.

197
00:12:43,155 --> 00:12:44,398
Try out the couch.

198
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,039
Nice.

199
00:12:51,324 --> 00:12:53,487
No, I said...

200
00:12:55,301 --> 00:12:57,223
try out the couch.

201
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:04,945
I like this couch.

202
00:13:05,016 --> 00:13:06,522
I thought you would.

203
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:12,003
Oh, way too early in the day for me to see this.

204
00:13:12,544 --> 00:13:14,915
Well, what hour would you prefer to watch us?

205
00:13:14,991 --> 00:13:17,397
Oh, how about never o'clock?

206
00:13:17,469 --> 00:13:19,854
Or maybe, uh, I don't know, quarter after stab out my eyes?

207
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:21,345
Either one's really good for me.

208
00:13:21,575 --> 00:13:24,063
By the way, that couch has not been staingarded yet.

209
00:13:24,115 --> 00:13:25,867
You may want to get a room instead.

210
00:13:25,933 --> 00:13:29,419
Well, if we get a room, then you're gonna be stuck on this tiny couch.

211
00:13:29,762 --> 00:13:31,032
That's a good point.

212
00:13:32,337 --> 00:13:34,171
Give me a minute. We'll go to the beach.

213
00:13:41,594 --> 00:13:43,089
Brooke asked me to help her out.

214
00:13:43,161 --> 00:13:45,998
And by "Brooke," you mean your part-time girlfriend Brooke?

215
00:13:46,905 --> 00:13:47,522
Yeah.

216
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:49,626
We're gonna set up for the end-of-summer thing.

217
00:13:50,509 --> 00:13:52,245
What's  up with that, anyway?

218
00:13:52,752 --> 00:13:56,176
Well, you see, there's a season called "summer," Haley.

219
00:13:56,237 --> 00:13:59,208
And when that ends, another season called "fall" starts right up.

220
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,103
Oh okay. Rephrasing -- what's up with the part-time girlfriend stuff?

221
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:04,982
I don't know yet.

222
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,467
Right now, we're on Brooke's terms.

223
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,642
But I'll keep you posted.

224
00:14:09,719 --> 00:14:10,917
Oh, gee, thanks.

225
00:14:10,993 --> 00:14:12,786
I also came to check on you.

226
00:14:12,808 --> 00:14:14,029
I was worried about you.

227
00:14:14,117 --> 00:14:17,086
Nathan was in a pretty bad mood this morning at the river court.

228
00:14:17,435 --> 00:14:19,723
I thought that might have something to do with you.

229
00:14:21,812 --> 00:14:23,272
Nathan's home?

230
00:14:24,705 --> 00:14:27,777
You... didn't know he was back?

231
00:14:29,636 --> 00:14:30,460
No.

232
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:32,974
No,  I didn't.

233
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,381
I'm sorry, Haley.

234
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:36,886
I thought you knew.

235
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,015
Can you just, um, tell Brooke that I'll see her tonight?

236
00:15:00,111 --> 00:15:03,470
Well, well. If it isn't my beloved daughter-in-law.

237
00:15:05,175 --> 00:15:08,953
Haley, it's so nice of you to come by and check on me following my accident.

238
00:15:09,065 --> 00:15:11,512
Oh, by the way, I think I found a pair of your black gloves.

239
00:15:11,599 --> 00:15:12,404
Leather, right?

240
00:15:12,435 --> 00:15:15,450
Uh, no, I-I don't own any black gloves, Mr. Scott.

241
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:19,878
I know your parents aren't around, so call me "dad."

242
00:15:20,739 --> 00:15:23,048
I'd really just like to see Nathan.

243
00:15:23,488 --> 00:15:25,470
He didn't tell you he was coming home.

244
00:15:28,164 --> 00:15:30,427
Sometimes I'm so proud of that kid.

245
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:32,484
Can I fix you a drink?

246
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,945
I hear you rock stars are big drinkers, right?

247
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:40,057
Well... suit yourself.

248
00:15:41,491 --> 00:15:43,353
Deb said you moved out.

249
00:15:43,456 --> 00:15:44,787
Yeah. It sucks, huh?

250
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:47,373
My marriage is over.

251
00:15:48,325 --> 00:15:51,260
Who knew you and I would have so much in common, after all?

252
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,394
Could you please just tell Nathan that I'm here?

253
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:54,823
Oh, he's not home.

254
00:16:07,588 --> 00:16:08,857
We had an agreement.

255
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,638
Hi, Larry. Long time.

256
00:16:10,690 --> 00:16:11,867
Not long enough.

257
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:15,809
You'll forgive me if I skip the love and go straight to the "you've got a lot of nerve" part.

258
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,422
Peyton is a real mess right now.

259
00:16:17,478 --> 00:16:19,527
- I'm sorry about that.
- You caused it!

260
00:16:19,578 --> 00:16:22,721
No, I think you caused it by not telling her about me.

261
00:16:22,785 --> 00:16:25,825
Don't even go there, Ellie! You agreed to stay away!

262
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,806
Yeah, well, things change!

263
00:16:33,361 --> 00:16:35,093
You have a right to be pissed.

264
00:16:35,164 --> 00:16:38,583
I said I'd stay away, but my situation has changed.

265
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:41,471
And now I would like to get to know Peyton...

266
00:16:42,834 --> 00:16:44,830
with your blessing, of course.

267
00:16:45,579 --> 00:16:48,118
That is not going to happen.

268
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:50,252
You gave her up.

269
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:52,634
You have to live with that.

270
00:16:53,843 --> 00:16:56,975
And now, thanks to your change of heart, so does Peyton.

271
00:16:58,055 --> 00:16:59,740
Stay away from us.

272
00:17:09,004 --> 00:17:10,467
You think this is enough?

273
00:17:12,169 --> 00:17:15,618
For a campfire, not a bonfire.

274
00:17:15,837 --> 00:17:17,808
I'll get some more before I pick you up, all right?

275
00:17:18,105 --> 00:17:18,986
Oh.

276
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:23,932
I was thinking about riding in with Peyton and playing the field tonight.

277
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,443
The field. Right.

278
00:17:28,524 --> 00:17:30,414
We said non-exclusively.

279
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:32,518
Yes, I know, but...

280
00:17:33,788 --> 00:17:37,086
Well, I'm not sure you're gonna be able to handle this whole non-exclusive thing.

281
00:17:37,147 --> 00:17:39,282
Oh, ho! You don't say?

282
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:42,406
Well, I mean, pretty soon you're obviously gonna fall for me.

283
00:17:42,472 --> 00:17:46,005
And then you're gonna have to break up with all those guys and that's just gonna get ugly.

284
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,263
I see.

285
00:17:48,491 --> 00:17:50,412
I'm just looking out for you.

286
00:17:51,242 --> 00:17:53,172
Well, thanks, I think I'll be fine.

287
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,998
- You're sure? 
- I'm sure.

288
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:02,451
Well, since the work's done, I think I'm gonna go for a little swim.

289
00:18:05,638 --> 00:18:09,153
You, uh, want to come look out for me some more?

290
00:18:10,489 --> 00:18:11,574
Sure.

291
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:13,458
I'll catch up.

292
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:14,487
Okay.

293
00:18:25,762 --> 00:18:26,673
What's up, mom?

294
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:27,789
Can I ask you a question?

295
00:18:27,813 --> 00:18:28,736
Yeah. Sure.

296
00:18:29,115 --> 00:18:31,440
- What does "woot" mean? 
- "Woot"?

297
00:18:31,511 --> 00:18:35,751
Yeah. You know, I have this hip new café. I need to be s sure that my vocabulary is current.

298
00:18:35,956 --> 00:18:39,150
Right. Well, "woot" would be like "yahoo."

299
00:18:39,289 --> 00:18:42,519
Oh, okay. So I would go like, "woot!"

300
00:18:43,241 --> 00:18:45,223
No, mom.

301
00:18:45,386 --> 00:18:48,515
You would never go like that. As a matter of fact, never do that again.

302
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:53,331
But if "woot" is "yahoo," then what is "what-what"?

303
00:18:54,178 --> 00:18:56,713
You want to know the difference between "woot" and "what-what"?

304
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:59,831
Yeah. You know, like, "what-what!"

305
00:18:59,892 --> 00:19:01,760
Mom, seriously --

306
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:03,634
never again.

307
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:06,020
You got to lay off the hip-hop.

308
00:19:06,532 --> 00:19:08,493
This is Andy's influence, isn't it?

309
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:12,486
When's he coming back, anyway?

310
00:19:12,703 --> 00:19:15,389
Well, I'm not so sure that he is coming back.

311
00:19:15,457 --> 00:19:16,163
Why not?

312
00:19:16,229 --> 00:19:19,936
Because, Lucas, Andy wanted kids.

313
00:19:20,122 --> 00:19:23,823
He wanted to start a family and I'm not sure that I want the same.

314
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:28,349
Oh. So, what? Your first kid was so rotten that I scared you from trying again.

315
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:30,326
Essentially, yes, that's it.

316
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:33,904
Andy's a wonderful guy. He deserves a family.

317
00:19:36,926 --> 00:19:38,517
And then there's Keith.

318
00:19:39,086 --> 00:19:39,998
What about Keith?

319
00:19:40,213 --> 00:19:42,482
I've been thinking about him a lot.

320
00:19:42,942 --> 00:19:46,919
As a matter of fact, I, uh, thought I saw him in town the day I left for New Zealand,

321
00:19:46,996 --> 00:19:49,648
the day of the fire at Dan's dealership.

322
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,250
You know, maybe I should go.

323
00:19:55,474 --> 00:19:57,917
I got a lot of errands to run before this beach party tonight.

324
00:19:57,994 --> 00:20:01,829
End-of-the-summer beach party -- what-what!

325
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,125
Hey.

326
00:20:25,786 --> 00:20:28,816
I saw your car. I-I didn't know you were home.

327
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:31,696
Yeah, I know.

328
00:20:34,391 --> 00:20:35,923
Did you get the letters I sent?

329
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:38,057
Yeah.

330
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:41,029
It's good to see you.

331
00:20:41,187 --> 00:20:43,256
Look, Haley, I can't do this, all right?

332
00:20:43,322 --> 00:20:45,832
What? You can't do what? You can't talk to me?

333
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:48,610
You didn't even tell me you were home, Nathan.

334
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:51,601
What were you gonna do, pass me in the hallway at school and not say a word?

335
00:20:51,663 --> 00:20:53,496
I didn't even know if you would be in school.

336
00:20:53,736 --> 00:20:55,885
I told you, I'm back for good.

337
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:04,161
Anyway, um, I don't know if you heard, but I'm staying in our apartment.

338
00:21:04,856 --> 00:21:08,359
Brooke rented it and asked me to be her roommate.

339
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:09,864
You and Brooke, huh?

340
00:21:09,926 --> 00:21:12,219
Yeah. I did not see that coming.

341
00:21:13,132 --> 00:21:17,508
Oh, by the way, if this basketball thing doesn't work out, you may have a future as a painter.

342
00:21:23,375 --> 00:21:27,032
Nathan, we have some decisions to make.

343
00:21:27,103 --> 00:21:27,918
Yeah.

344
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:30,421
Yeah, we do.

345
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,895
Yeah.

346
00:21:33,402 --> 00:21:37,678
Well, uh, I guess I'll beat the beach tonight.

347
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:39,494
There's a party.

348
00:21:42,238 --> 00:21:43,043
Yeah.

349
00:21:51,004 --> 00:21:52,114
You've changed.

350
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:54,497
Yeah.

351
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,293
I guess I have you to thank for that.

352
00:22:35,566 --> 00:22:38,662
Okay, not exactly your finest hour in party attire.

353
00:22:38,713 --> 00:22:41,324
But who knows? Somedy might go for the homeless-girl look.

354
00:22:41,405 --> 00:22:43,136
You know I don't even want to go to this thing.

355
00:22:43,198 --> 00:22:45,456
I know. But because Mouth is throwing himself

356
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:47,662
his own personal pity party over Erica Marsh,

357
00:22:47,703 --> 00:22:50,841
you, P. Sawyer, as you know, are my D.J.

358
00:22:51,267 --> 00:22:55,082
Besides, this is the last end-of-summer beach party we're gonna have before we're seniors.

359
00:22:55,132 --> 00:22:57,663
Oh, come on. You know you were gonna have another chance next year

360
00:22:57,703 --> 00:22:59,776
after you flunk out and have to repeat a grade.

361
00:22:59,858 --> 00:23:03,367
See? That's the spirit... sort of.

362
00:23:03,438 --> 00:23:04,773
A little mean, but it's a start.

363
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:07,395
Speaking of mean, please don't be to Haley tonight, okay?

364
00:23:07,457 --> 00:23:08,215
Let's party.

365
00:23:10,454 --> 00:23:11,305
Come on.

366
00:23:17,384 --> 00:23:18,946
It's about time!

367
00:23:19,017 --> 00:23:20,472
Can we light the bonfire now?

368
00:23:20,544 --> 00:23:21,762
Can  we? Can we?

369
00:23:21,829 --> 00:23:24,854
Oh, look, it's Tim. I had a dream you died. Darn.

370
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,887
Check it out. I brought some really cool stuff to burn.

371
00:23:26,948 --> 00:23:30,871
I got cleaning supplies, some army men, some rotten fruit.

372
00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:34,520
And there's this dead animal down the beach that would burn really cool!

373
00:23:34,578 --> 00:23:38,459
Come to think of it, Tim, you might burn really cool.

374
00:23:38,514 --> 00:23:40,169
Let's sacrifice a virgin.

375
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,221
Sweet! Like who?

376
00:23:45,892 --> 00:23:47,905
Crap! Cops!

377
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,801
Hey, Brooke. What's going on? You got cups for us?

378
00:23:51,858 --> 00:23:53,485
Sure, boys, right this way.

379
00:23:58,194 --> 00:23:59,840
I'm sorry. I thought they were 5-O.

380
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,840
I-I'm sure there's still... some...

381
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:49,969
People have had fire rituals since the beginning of time.

382
00:24:50,052 --> 00:24:51,922
For some people, it's witchcraft.

383
00:24:52,004 --> 00:24:53,497
For others -- religion.

384
00:24:53,585 --> 00:24:58,187
But for us, it marks the beginning of our senior year!

385
00:25:02,739 --> 00:25:04,987
I know we have to go back to school soon.

386
00:25:05,033 --> 00:25:10,583
But tonight, as long as this fire burns, summer is still ours.

387
00:25:45,859 --> 00:25:48,876
Look who it is -- the kissing bandit.

388
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:51,927
Did you fondle anyone while I was away?

389
00:25:51,994 --> 00:25:53,438
I should apologize.

390
00:25:53,812 --> 00:25:56,566
I won't, but I should.

391
00:25:57,267 --> 00:26:01,102
That kiss was a reckless mistake, sort of like Lucas.

392
00:26:03,381 --> 00:26:04,456
That was a joke.

393
00:26:04,539 --> 00:26:05,403
Funny.

394
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,426
No wonder you're getting a divorce.

395
00:26:08,475 --> 00:26:09,760
How's that going, by the way?

396
00:26:09,848 --> 00:26:11,784
Why? Are you ready for round two?

397
00:26:11,934 --> 00:26:16,781
Hmm. I'm sorry, I just threw up a little in my mouth.

398
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:18,803
Could I just have a coffee, please?

399
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:21,270
Sure, just let me spit in it first.

400
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,191
Or maybe you could drug it.

401
00:26:25,608 --> 00:26:29,257
You know, Karen, as I recall, you were pretty angry with me the day of the fire.

402
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,633
You know what, Dan?

403
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,941
If you're looking for people who were pretty angry with you,

404
00:26:34,982 --> 00:26:37,462
you might start at "A" in the phone book.

405
00:26:37,532 --> 00:26:39,631
You mean "A" as in "Andy"?

406
00:26:39,693 --> 00:26:42,298
Or maybe "B" as in Boozy?

407
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:45,418
What do we hear from rag-doll Keith these days, anyway?

408
00:26:45,509 --> 00:26:46,876
What are you trying to say?

409
00:26:46,948 --> 00:26:48,535
The fire wasn't an accident?

410
00:26:48,617 --> 00:26:49,605
Why?

411
00:26:50,009 --> 00:26:51,718
Is that what you're saying?

412
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:56,917
You know what? I think I'm gonna play the old "right to refuse service" card.

413
00:26:57,081 --> 00:26:58,130
You can get out.

414
00:26:58,339 --> 00:26:59,631
You said I could have a coffee.

415
00:26:59,727 --> 00:27:03,025
Well, let's just call that a reckless mistake.

416
00:27:03,107 --> 00:27:05,027
Hmm. Fair enough.

417
00:27:05,109 --> 00:27:06,588
Say "hi" to Andy for me.

418
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:08,995
That is, if you ever see the little guy again.

419
00:27:09,348 --> 00:27:13,838
You know what? If someone did try to kill you, I'm sorry they failed, Dan.

420
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:19,107
Maybe next time they won't...

421
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,201
whoever they were.

422
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:37,769
Who wants to swim with naked Tim?

423
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:41,534
Who wants to get drunk and have sex with him?

424
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,023
I know they call its kinny-dipping, but you want to try anyway?

425
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:48,333
I'm pregnant, you idiot.

426
00:27:51,456 --> 00:27:52,868
I'm cool with that.

427
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,077
Hey.

428
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:13,845
How's that casual-dating thing working out for you?

429
00:28:14,316 --> 00:28:15,397
So-so.

430
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,254
It could be worse.

431
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:18,751
Nathan didn't even show up.

432
00:28:35,508 --> 00:28:36,604
I don't blame you.

433
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:37,797
What's that?

434
00:28:38,473 --> 00:28:41,653
This music, it's enough to drive anyone to drink.

435
00:28:43,358 --> 00:28:44,397
Mom stuff?

436
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:47,611
I don't know. I don't feel like I owe Ellie a thing, you know?

437
00:28:47,668 --> 00:28:52,205
But I still feel guilty sometimes for freezing her out.

438
00:28:52,691 --> 00:28:53,398
Yeah?

439
00:28:53,449 --> 00:28:56,930
I mean, is trusting someone always gonna be impossible in my life?

440
00:28:58,753 --> 00:29:00,961
Maybe I should at least try with her.

441
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,631
There's that look again.

442
00:29:04,923 --> 00:29:06,737
What look? I don't have a look.

443
00:29:06,793 --> 00:29:10,580
Dude, you've got a tell the size of J.Lo's ass.

444
00:29:10,991 --> 00:29:12,270
What have you got on Ellie?

445
00:29:15,188 --> 00:29:21,547
Luke, if I'm about to make a huge mistake, please, just help me out.

446
00:29:23,385 --> 00:29:24,411
The thing is...

447
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:30,200
I saw her buying drugs in the park today. I'm sorry.

448
00:29:30,708 --> 00:29:32,344
No. God.

449
00:29:32,517 --> 00:29:36,139
You know what? It -- it makes all the sense in the world, you know?

450
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:40,359
She said she was clean, but, so far, all she's done is lie. Anyway, so...

451
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,511
Is this a funeral?

452
00:29:44,604 --> 00:29:49,180
Will you please play something that doesn't make me want to shoot up and die?

453
00:30:02,693 --> 00:30:03,829
Thank you.

454
00:30:07,884 --> 00:30:09,292
I need a drink.

455
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:16,190
If I were looking for a guy to go skinny-dipping with,

456
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,363
would you be that guy?

457
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,032
Can I be that guy in 20 minutes?

458
00:31:25,402 --> 00:31:29,400
Mmm... I'll give you 15, then I'm going wide with the offer.

459
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:50,008
How come you're not at the party?

460
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,860
How come you're not in the gym?

461
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:55,851
You know that little one-on-one game?

462
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:58,369
That was a joke. You better get yourself in shape.

463
00:31:58,435 --> 00:32:01,359
Otherwise you're gonna be completely worthless to me this season --

464
00:32:01,457 --> 00:32:03,572
instead of mostly worthless, like you are now.

465
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,446
I know why you're here, Nathan.

466
00:32:09,254 --> 00:32:10,995
Haley's not going away, you know.

467
00:32:11,057 --> 00:32:14,083
Dude, for once, could you just mind your own damn business?

468
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,816
As soon as you forgive her and try to work things out.

469
00:32:18,547 --> 00:32:19,904
She loves you, Nate!

470
00:32:19,970 --> 00:32:22,034
And is that supposed to make everything okay?

471
00:32:22,971 --> 00:32:24,615
Yeah, it is.

472
00:32:26,622 --> 00:32:27,660
You're an idiot.

473
00:32:34,125 --> 00:32:36,011
You know something, Nathan?!

474
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:38,828
I've tried with you!

475
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,715
But sometimes I wonder why I bother!

476
00:32:41,788 --> 00:32:43,615
- Then don't.
- Fine! I won't!

477
00:32:46,221 --> 00:32:51,035
You want to be a coward? Fine. Stay here and hide.

478
00:32:51,105 --> 00:32:52,442
Don't go to the party.

479
00:32:53,973 --> 00:32:57,126
But if you think I'm gonna let you mistreat Haley,

480
00:32:57,373 --> 00:32:58,626
you're wrong.

481
00:32:59,457 --> 00:33:02,333
Don't try it for a second. Because if you do,

482
00:33:02,862 --> 00:33:04,387
I'm gonna hurt you.

483
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:08,939
Jackass.

484
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:44,594
Well, at least she won't drown naked.

485
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,862
Hey, Tutor Girl, check it out.

486
00:34:07,103 --> 00:34:09,341
The stars are blue. Do your song.

487
00:34:09,407 --> 00:34:10,650
Uh, no, thanks.

488
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:11,896
Why not?

489
00:34:12,002 --> 00:34:13,237
'Cause I don't want to.

490
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:17,470
Oh, come on, don't be stuck up. Look, I'll sing the Chris Keller part.

491
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:20,558
- Tim, I really don't want to sing. 
- Please? Let me --

492
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:28,498
Nathan's back.

493
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:44,380
Lucas.

494
00:34:46,951 --> 00:34:47,823
Hey.

495
00:34:47,925 --> 00:34:49,031
You having fun yet?

496
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:50,540
Are you?

497
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,621
Yeah.

498
00:34:52,838 --> 00:34:55,226
You know, we're never gonna be here again, Luke.

499
00:34:55,486 --> 00:34:58,353
Seniors, summer -- you got to enjoy it.

500
00:34:58,441 --> 00:34:59,464
No, you're right.

501
00:34:59,957 --> 00:35:01,743
We should enjoy it, you know?

502
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:04,098
But do you think that if we're never gonna be here again,

503
00:35:04,165 --> 00:35:06,367
then maybe we should make it mean something, too?

504
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:08,419
Brooke Davis!

505
00:35:08,699 --> 00:35:11,379
Do not put your clothes on!

506
00:35:12,254 --> 00:35:13,308
Um...

507
00:35:14,769 --> 00:35:16,069
The field calls.

508
00:35:26,039 --> 00:35:27,201
Hey, girly.

509
00:35:28,675 --> 00:35:31,732
I left you like a million messages. Where have you been?

510
00:35:33,384 --> 00:35:34,225
Around.

511
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:46,739
Drinking, huh? I should probably join you, with the night I'm having.

512
00:35:46,825 --> 00:35:50,144
It's like, Tim wants me to play, Nathan won't even talk to me.

513
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,421
Well, it's not like you don't deserve it.

514
00:36:02,197 --> 00:36:03,235
Hey.

515
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,068
Can I talk to you?

516
00:36:13,118 --> 00:36:14,498
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

517
00:36:14,888 --> 00:36:16,680
I should have told you I was back in town.

518
00:36:18,257 --> 00:36:19,182
It's okay.

519
00:36:20,002 --> 00:36:21,094
Not really.

520
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:26,659
Look, I've been avoiding you because I'm still mad, Haley, about everything.

521
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:30,001
I don't see that changing anytime soon.

522
00:36:33,883 --> 00:36:36,228
Do you know the last two times I came to the beach?

523
00:36:37,285 --> 00:36:40,089
For our wedding and to burn the wedding wall.

524
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:43,571
So that's what happened to it.

525
00:36:44,046 --> 00:36:47,595
Well, first I broke it in half with the keyboard I bought you, and then I burned it.

526
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:49,331
Sorry.

527
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:56,950
Nathan, I need to ask you something, and I really don't want you to take it the wrong way, but...

528
00:36:58,208 --> 00:37:02,166
I need to know what you want from me or from us.

529
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:05,321
What are we now?

530
00:37:06,652 --> 00:37:07,727
I don't know.

531
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,890
What do you want us to be?

532
00:37:12,058 --> 00:37:14,757
I don't know, Haley. I can't answer that right now.

533
00:37:14,828 --> 00:37:15,781
I can.

534
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:17,830
I want us to be together.

535
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:18,934
Why?

536
00:37:20,097 --> 00:37:23,783
I mean, we're so far away from who we used to be. Why even fight for it?

537
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:25,178
Because I love you.

538
00:37:29,103 --> 00:37:30,255
Listen...

539
00:37:31,561 --> 00:37:33,844
Basketball season's coming up and I'm --

540
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,538
I'm gonna concentrate on that.

541
00:37:35,555 --> 00:37:38,320
So you should do your thing, whatever it is --

542
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:40,162
school, music --

543
00:37:40,387 --> 00:37:42,056
something other than me.

544
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:47,683
Because I really don't know when I'm gonna be ready for us again...

545
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:50,457
or even if I'll be ready for us at all.

546
00:37:50,489 --> 00:37:52,051
Nathan, don't say that. God --

547
00:37:52,138 --> 00:37:56,340
Haley, i'm not saying it to be mean, okay? I don't --

548
00:37:56,581 --> 00:37:58,630
I don't like hurting you.

549
00:37:58,937 --> 00:38:01,155
I'm just trying to be honest.

550
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,329
I'm gonna head back.

551
00:38:16,117 --> 00:38:17,671
Nathan...

552
00:38:22,654 --> 00:38:24,435
I'm not going anywhere.

553
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:28,532
Okay.

554
00:38:53,229 --> 00:38:54,638
And then...

555
00:38:55,432 --> 00:38:56,968
... there were two.

556
00:38:59,763 --> 00:39:01,463
That's not so bad.

557
00:39:02,226 --> 00:39:05,707
This is how we started last school year, and look how good that turned out.

558
00:39:11,217 --> 00:39:12,400
Let's take a walk.

559
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:25,727
Give me a minute.

560
00:39:33,171 --> 00:39:34,719
What's going on, guys?

561
00:39:34,741 --> 00:39:35,674
What's up?

562
00:39:35,881 --> 00:39:37,194
You got a second?

563
00:39:37,281 --> 00:39:38,990
Sure. What's up?

564
00:39:40,597 --> 00:39:42,699
I'm the guy for you.

565
00:39:43,002 --> 00:39:44,978
I know we're just part-time, and that's cool.

566
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,252
You know, do whatever, have your fun.

567
00:39:48,104 --> 00:39:50,631
But one of these nights, you're gonna realize it.

568
00:39:51,515 --> 00:39:53,991
I'm the guy for you, Brooke Davis.

569
00:39:59,032 --> 00:39:59,998
You'll see.

570
00:40:04,137 --> 00:40:05,730
You guys take it easy.

571
00:40:43,127 --> 00:40:44,001
Here.

572
00:40:44,244 --> 00:40:45,876
It used to be my cocaine vial.

573
00:40:47,331 --> 00:40:50,469
I thought you might like it, considering you were buying drugs today.

574
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:08,204
It's gonna be okay, Hales.

575
00:41:08,405 --> 00:41:14,124
As a matter of fact, I think that this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship...

576
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:16,270
again.

577
00:42:02,449 --> 00:42:06,133
