1
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:27,251
Nathan.

2
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:31,778
- Remember, 20 shots -- no less. 
- Got it, dad.

3
00:00:32,659 --> 00:00:34,413
Quit yakking and warm up.

4
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:53,017
Basket by Nathan Scott!

5
00:00:53,098 --> 00:00:55,043
He really looks sharp out there tonight.

6
00:00:56,328 --> 00:00:59,325
And now a steal by the ravens. They'll go on the offensive.

7
00:00:59,667 --> 00:01:03,758
Coach Whitey Durham urges them on. Tim Smith -- he's got Scott!

8
00:01:03,825 --> 00:01:06,677
And he hammers it home!

9
00:01:06,795 --> 00:01:10,204
He's already got 14 of the Ravens' 17 points tonight.

10
00:01:11,412 --> 00:01:13,410
Turn around jumper by Nathan Scott!

11
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:17,500
We haven't seen talent like this since his father, Dan, played for whitey.

12
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,890
Here's Scott again -- another one! It's all Nathan Scott!

13
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,280
And here he is, ladies and gentlemen, Lucas Scott.

14
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:27,756
What's happening, baby?

15
00:01:28,852 --> 00:01:32,588
- 137 and 3 going into tonight's contest. 
- He sucks.

16
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,600
And as a special bonus, we're joined in the booth by Junk Moreti.

17
00:01:36,706 --> 00:01:37,725
You don't have a booth.

18
00:01:38,278 --> 00:01:41,417
Actually, he's 138 and 3 -- Lucas.

19
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:45,870
Jeez, Edwards, but you can't remember to run a bar of soap under your pits?

20
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:48,328
You smell bad, man. You're ripe.

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:54,346
You guys are stinking up the place! Time-out!

22
00:01:58,005 --> 00:01:59,985
Come on, hustle, hustle, hustle!

23
00:02:01,481 --> 00:02:05,956
- Just what in the hell is going on out there? 
- Whitey, relax. We're up by 9.

24
00:02:06,725 --> 00:02:07,473
Tim...

25
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:09,628
Go in for Nathan.

26
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:17,205
All right, let's get out there and act like we've played the game before.

27
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:20,462
Ravens on 3. 1, 2, 3. Ravens!

28
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:25,598
What have I told you about that?

29
00:02:26,206 --> 00:02:29,293
I don't care if we're up by 5 or 50.

30
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:32,376
I'm still the coach. It's still my team.

31
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,194
Whatever you need to believe.

32
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:41,899
Lucas Scott with the ball. And he currently nurses a big winning streak.

33
00:02:43,306 --> 00:02:47,539
Come on. 14-13, game point for team Scott.

34
00:02:54,037 --> 00:02:56,113
And the hawks pull within one.

35
00:02:56,214 --> 00:02:59,523
And you have to wonder where is Nathan Scott?

36
00:03:03,171 --> 00:03:04,172
Go on.

37
00:03:06,697 --> 00:03:07,776
Let's go, Nathan!

38
00:03:11,468 --> 00:03:12,932
Don't bother showering tonight.

39
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:20,039
For those of you at home, Lucas wears his black shorts tonight

40
00:03:20,096 --> 00:03:21,871
with his traditional white high-tops.

41
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:24,887
He is currently playing without a shoe contract, mouth.

42
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:29,915
Under 20 seconds to go, and it's all tied up. Fasten your seat belts, folks.

43
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:34,319
We're going down to the wire. Stolen by Nathan Scott!

44
00:03:34,406 --> 00:03:41,114
The ravens have it! They're gonna hold on 10 seconds remaining on the clock.

45
00:03:41,485 --> 00:03:43,110
Now five!

46
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,910
Luke flashes in the paint. Fergie finds one on the wing.

47
00:03:46,038 --> 00:03:48,727
- Scott for the game! 
- Scott for the game!

48
00:04:13,129 --> 00:04:15,765
You, tell me we didn't just steal a school bus,

49
00:04:15,816 --> 00:04:18,540
'cause this feels like we just stole a school bus.

50
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:20,046
Dude, we just borrowed it, all right?

51
00:04:34,828 --> 00:04:36,788
So, Nathan, where's Peyton?

52
00:04:37,178 --> 00:04:37,956
Who knows?

53
00:04:38,744 --> 00:04:39,406
Why?

54
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:53,864
Look out!

55
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:42,075
Some of your parents see this latest incident as tomfoolery,

56
00:05:42,822 --> 00:05:43,897
a little prank.

57
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:46,825
Personally, I see a little breaking and entering.

58
00:05:47,563 --> 00:05:50,718
Chief Wayman sees possession and consumption by minors

59
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,760
and a smidgen of grand theft auto.

60
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,507
That said, I think it's time we send a message.

61
00:05:58,781 --> 00:06:03,031
The following players were not involved and will not be reprimanded --

62
00:06:04,306 --> 00:06:07,515
Jake Jagielski, Ruben Gutierrez,

63
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:11,883
Tim smith, and Nathan Scott.

64
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:17,925
As for the rest of you, all players involved are suspended from extracurricular activities,

65
00:06:18,001 --> 00:06:19,747
specifically basketball,

66
00:06:20,772 --> 00:06:22,052
for the rest of the season.

67
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:31,032
So, you just walk away.

68
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:35,589
Well, well. Dan Scott.

69
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:39,050
Half the team suspended, Nathan triple-teamed the rest of the season,

70
00:06:39,127 --> 00:06:40,417
and you say nothing.

71
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:43,602
The inmates will not run the asylum.

72
00:06:43,965 --> 00:06:45,522
You're despicable, you know that?

73
00:06:46,576 --> 00:06:48,973
Letting the dreams of this team just vanish.

74
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:51,359
You're full of crap.

75
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:56,925
It comes with old age, Danny, constipation.

76
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,680
You guys remember Tom Dugan from grade school?

77
00:07:05,946 --> 00:07:07,773
He used to live next door to you, right?

78
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:11,066
Some guy snapped him with a wet towel, and he lost one of his testicles.

79
00:07:12,172 --> 00:07:14,087
- Come on. 
- Okay, junk.

80
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:17,414
- Just saying what I heard. 
- Anyway, man, what you reading these days?

81
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:20,312
Steinbeck -- "the winter of our discontent."

82
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:21,700
Let me hear some.

83
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,286
- Nah. 
- Come on, dog.

84
00:07:24,357 --> 00:07:26,794
You know I be reading vicariously through you.

85
00:07:28,766 --> 00:07:29,990
Peyton Sawyer.

86
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,549
You seen her webcam?

87
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,108
In her bedroom --

88
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,735
I hear she's naked on it, like, all the time.

89
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:46,250
What? I hear things.

90
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:49,665
You know, I saw her the other night.

91
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:53,112
She almost ran me over, of course.

92
00:07:53,792 --> 00:07:56,261
- Yeah, she pretty fine, huh? 
- Ah, she's all right.

93
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:01,227
Just shoot for teams, all right?

94
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,090
Hey, mom.

95
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,268
Hey, hon.

96
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:15,758
It smells good in here.

97
00:08:16,427 --> 00:08:17,979
Did you change your hair?

98
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:22,092
If by "change" you mean "dragged a brush through it," then yeah.

99
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:24,652
- Well, it looks nice. 
- Thank you.

100
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:29,956
The  magazine pages are sticky again. Little pervs.

101
00:08:30,141 --> 00:08:33,134
- Oh, hey, Luke. You been reading this?
- I don't know, Haley. 

102
00:08:33,252 --> 00:08:36,217
Is that the "why do I hang out with these people?" Issue, because you're on the cover of that, right?

103
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:40,601
No, actually, it's the "my best friend is an idiot" issue, and there you are.

104
00:08:42,741 --> 00:08:45,696
- Haley, would you like to join us? 
- Hell, yes.

105
00:08:47,923 --> 00:08:50,478
- So, honey, how was your day? 
- Good, thanks.

106
00:08:50,882 --> 00:08:53,580
" Good" is relative, considering a third of the world is starving,

107
00:08:53,841 --> 00:08:57,317
which does not change the fact that I am clumsy as hell. Did I tell you that I fell down today?

108
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:00,835
Yeah, slipped off the curb, face down, butt in the air.

109
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:03,948
Too graphic? Sorry. I'll just be quiet.

110
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,280
-  So, I got something for you, Lucas. 
- Actually, I found it.

111
00:09:08,576 --> 00:09:12,822
Sorry. Not that I was looking for something specifically, which implies some hideous sort

112
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:14,453
of "Joey loves Dawson " scenario and completely creep me out,

113
00:09:14,527 --> 00:09:15,853
but, you know, we saw it, and...

114
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,430
Give him the book.

115
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,759
Wow. "Julius Caesar."

116
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:29,768
"There's a tide in the affairs of men" -- or something like that.

117
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:31,126
Nice.

118
00:09:32,845 --> 00:09:34,668
Thank you, guys. Thank you very much.

119
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,968
Whatever. That's what you're into.

120
00:09:53,085 --> 00:09:55,860
Well, well, Keith Scott. What do you know?

121
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:57,377
How you doing, Whitey?

122
00:09:57,616 --> 00:09:58,825
Take a load off.

123
00:09:59,116 --> 00:10:02,081
You... you got a second?

124
00:10:02,404 --> 00:10:05,594
Oh, I got a lot of seconds. Or haven't you heard?

125
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,273
Oh, yeah, I heard.

126
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,993
Just a little.

127
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:15,337
A little more.

128
00:10:17,863 --> 00:10:19,259
That's good. That's good.

129
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:27,196
I saw your little brother today -- Danny.

130
00:10:27,507 --> 00:10:29,105
He called me "despicable."

131
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:32,791
Said I crush the dreams of young men.

132
00:10:33,237 --> 00:10:36,165
Was he talking about himself or Nathan, do you think?

133
00:10:36,493 --> 00:10:37,813
Both, I suppose.

134
00:10:40,722 --> 00:10:44,096
Hey, what did you average when you played for me?

135
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:47,527
Oh, about 5,006 beers a night.

136
00:10:49,421 --> 00:10:52,197
Well, at least you were consistent.

137
00:10:52,345 --> 00:10:55,479
Yeah, you gotta give me that. Hey, you know...

138
00:10:57,014 --> 00:11:00,189
- Lucas plays. 
- Lucas? Oh.

139
00:11:01,433 --> 00:11:05,754
- Oh, Dan’s other son. 
- Well, Karen’s son.

140
00:11:06,809 --> 00:11:08,969
Dan's on the birth certificate, but they never got married.

141
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:11,006
Where does he play?

142
00:11:11,432 --> 00:11:14,370
Uh...This park down by the river.

143
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:16,221
Oh, come on, Keith.

144
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,570
If the kid had any promise, he'd be in the gym with the real players.

145
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,050
Like Nathan, you mean?

146
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,640
Come on, coach.

147
00:11:26,357 --> 00:11:27,868
Just take a little drive with me.

148
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:35,825
Luke is on fire tonight. How do you say "hot" in French?

149
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:38,113
- Flambé. 
- Luke is flambé.

150
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,180
Fergie finds Luke, who takes out junk again.

151
00:11:41,287 --> 00:11:42,675
They never learn, mouth.

152
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:45,076
See, that's what I’m talking about.

153
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:47,868
All right, lets say I'm interrested, and I'm not saying I am.

154
00:11:49,115 --> 00:11:51,348
Why put him through that?

155
00:11:51,701 --> 00:11:53,724
Because he should know that he's good --

156
00:11:53,944 --> 00:11:56,526
not just playground good, but good, period.

157
00:11:57,943 --> 00:11:59,443
He could use that in his life.

158
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:01,979
We could all use that in our lives.

159
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:05,859
Yeah. But we had our chance.

160
00:12:09,155 --> 00:12:12,586
- So, you and Karen -- are you... 
- Friends.

161
00:12:14,754 --> 00:12:19,611
You know, I'm the kid's uncle, and I'm in their lives. It is what it is.

162
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:23,007
I remember when Dan told me Karen was pregnant 

163
00:12:23,108 --> 00:12:25,527
right after their senior year in high school.

164
00:12:26,868 --> 00:12:31,019
I told him he should honor his scholarship and go to college.

165
00:12:31,812 --> 00:12:34,002
I'll tell you one thing -- you did Karen a favor.

166
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:35,652
And Lucas, too.

167
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:40,378
Now maybe you can do me one.

168
00:12:55,344 --> 00:12:56,665
What are you wasting your time at now?

169
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:00,238
- I didn't hear you come in. 
- Oh, imagine that.

170
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:03,843
You know nobody listens to this crap.

171
00:13:08,897 --> 00:13:10,411
So, I waited for you tonight.

172
00:13:11,232 --> 00:13:12,897
Yeah, the guys wanted to tip a few.

173
00:13:13,111 --> 00:13:14,892
And you didn't even think to let me know?

174
00:13:15,158 --> 00:13:17,489
That's why I came by. You want to come?

175
00:13:18,568 --> 00:13:20,575
- With the guys? 
- And me.

176
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:21,932
And the guys.

177
00:13:23,812 --> 00:13:26,223
You know what, Peyton? I'm getting really tired of this.

178
00:13:26,315 --> 00:13:29,925
- I came here to spend time with you. 
- Yeah, me and half the team.

179
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:32,174
whatever. You want to be a bitch? That's cool. 

180
00:13:32,276 --> 00:13:35,174
Just listen to your loser rock, and I'll see you tomorrow.

181
00:13:35,244 --> 00:13:39,531
- How about you don't see me tomorrow? 
- Fine by me. Like I don't have other options.

182
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:51,015
Look, I'm sorry. Peyton, I'm really sorry.

183
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,482
It's just a lot of these guys got suspended, so it's like this stupid bonding thing.

184
00:13:58,821 --> 00:14:01,341
Look, I wish it was just you and me.

185
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:05,023
But I was hoping you'd come anyway --

186
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,110
make it a lot more bearable, okay?

187
00:14:27,438 --> 00:14:30,223
- Scott. 
- What's up, coach?

188
00:14:30,316 --> 00:14:32,026
Not you. You.

189
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,629
You read a book or something.

190
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:51,589
Nice, isn't it?

191
00:14:53,376 --> 00:15:00,386
A lot of people like their gyms loud. I like mine like this -- quiet, clean...

192
00:15:01,548 --> 00:15:03,157
Kind of like a church.

193
00:15:04,782 --> 00:15:06,826
A lot of praying done here, anyway.

194
00:15:10,897 --> 00:15:12,934
You played ball in grade school.

195
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:14,855
Why'd you quit?

196
00:15:15,966 --> 00:15:16,831
I didn't.

197
00:15:17,205 --> 00:15:19,401
What, four guys in the park?

198
00:15:20,261 --> 00:15:22,243
That's not exactly basketball.

199
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:24,204
Then what do you think we're doing out there?

200
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:26,667
I  don't know. Planning a bank job?

201
00:15:28,909 --> 00:15:32,601
Look, I've got an opening in my lineup, varsity.

202
00:15:33,554 --> 00:15:35,007
Chance for a lifetime.

203
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,285
What do you say?

204
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,371
I say those people that pray here are wasting their time.

205
00:15:47,183 --> 00:15:49,016
God doesn't watch sports.

206
00:16:04,802 --> 00:16:06,005
Were you gonna tell us, man?

207
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:07,397
It's nothing.

208
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:11,559
Whitey asked you to play on the team, and it's nothing?

209
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:13,965
It's nothing 'cause I’m not playing --

210
00:16:15,292 --> 00:16:16,296
not with those guys.

211
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,405
Luke, man, I’ve been guarding you almost every night since we was 12 years old, right?

212
00:16:21,466 --> 00:16:22,752
And I won how many games?

213
00:16:23,196 --> 00:16:25,117
It just seems like a waste to me, man.

214
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,218
Well, it doesn't to me. Don't you guys ever think that maybe we belong here?

215
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:34,425
No. We belong here. You've never belonged here.

216
00:16:35,342 --> 00:16:38,384
Thanks a lot, skills. Just shoot for teams.

217
00:16:40,979 --> 00:16:44,163
Yo, luke, man, you know you're one of my best friends, right?

218
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:47,906
Ain't nothing never gonna change that, man. But keep it real.

219
00:16:48,429 --> 00:16:52,187
We ain't shooting for teams. We're shooting to be your excuse.

220
00:16:53,258 --> 00:16:54,951
And I ain't about to be a part of that, man.

221
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,069
Somebody left it at the door.

222
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,373
Take it off.

223
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:46,526
- Mom, you okay? 
- Yeah.

224
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:52,557
Do you know who left it?

225
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:54,953
Coach Durham, probably.

226
00:18:00,048 --> 00:18:01,686
He asked me to play.

227
00:18:03,826 --> 00:18:04,973
Maybe you should.

228
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:07,881
You sound like Skills.

229
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,027
Those guys refused to play today. They said they didn't want to be my excuse.

230
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,322
How'd you feel about that?

231
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:18,998
Honestly? I was pissed. Those guys are supposed to be my friends.

232
00:18:19,073 --> 00:18:20,349
They are your friends.

233
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:23,549
Do you remember that?

234
00:18:27,804 --> 00:18:29,448
My first leather basketball.

235
00:18:30,261 --> 00:18:32,990
That was the year that skills' father told us there was no Santa Claus.

236
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:35,141
Yeah, and I tried to talk you out of it.

237
00:18:36,487 --> 00:18:38,418
Then you said something I’ll never forget.

238
00:18:39,211 --> 00:18:42,520
You said you felt bad for the kids who never figured it out, because when they grew up

239
00:18:42,566 --> 00:18:45,617
and had kids of their own, there wouldn't be any gifts on Christmas morning.

240
00:18:47,788 --> 00:18:49,108
You're a good kid, Luke.

241
00:18:49,775 --> 00:18:52,447
But sometimes I feel like you're sitting out your life on account of me,

242
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:53,896
and I don't want that for you.

243
00:18:55,499 --> 00:18:58,438
My past is not your future, okay?

244
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:08,037
- What are you slinging? 
- About 160.

245
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:08,954
Give me that.

246
00:19:09,927 --> 00:19:13,167
Your mom called. She won't be back until next week.

247
00:19:13,424 --> 00:19:15,835
- What do you know about Whitey inviting... 
- Your son to play?

248
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:18,461
- Don't call him that. 
- He's got our last name, dad.

249
00:19:18,549 --> 00:19:24,044
The fact that he shares your last name is only wishful thinking on his mother's part.

250
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:27,386
We were young -- summer after high school. We made a mistake.

251
00:19:27,494 --> 00:19:30,316
You made a mistake, all right. I mean, this guy's a zombie.

252
00:19:30,797 --> 00:19:32,086
Okay.

253
00:19:33,412 --> 00:19:37,315
Look, it's kind of screwed up, all right? People talk about it.

254
00:19:42,479 --> 00:19:43,498
Get out of there.

255
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:48,768
I want you to go to this kid, encourage him not to play.

256
00:19:49,413 --> 00:19:51,695
- I'm not afraid of him, dad. 
- Well, you should be.

257
00:19:52,448 --> 00:19:54,606
We've worked too hard to have anyone coming in now,

258
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,452
disrupting the offense, taking away shots.

259
00:19:57,313 --> 00:20:01,317
Anyway, this has more to do with Whitey and me than you.

260
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,507
- Why do you say that? 
- It's a long story.

261
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,483
If you want, I'll tell you someday.

262
00:20:07,481 --> 00:20:10,287
But for now, I want you to go to this kid and talk to him

263
00:20:10,506 --> 00:20:13,124
and trust me when I tell you, Nathan, there's a bigger picture here --

264
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:16,232
your picture, and this kid's not in it.

265
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:35,181
So, your pops finally mentioned the bastard spawn, huh?

266
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:38,375
They say he's got game. Maybe we could use him.

267
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:43,670
Please. I can get us to the state championship with three blind guys and a cripple,

268
00:20:43,926 --> 00:20:45,943
which is practically what I got with you and what's left.

269
00:20:46,415 --> 00:20:48,529
Nice. So, where are we going?

270
00:20:49,687 --> 00:20:50,593
Let's go to the park.

271
00:21:04,877 --> 00:21:05,692
Nice shot.

272
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:09,695
Think you can hit that against a double team, down by 2,

273
00:21:10,156 --> 00:21:11,825
packed house telling you you suck?

274
00:21:12,711 --> 00:21:14,703
How about just two people telling you you suck?

275
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,094
What do you want?

276
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,454
What do I want?

277
00:21:19,504 --> 00:21:20,836
What do you want, man?

278
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:25,455
I mean, other than my girlfriend and my spot in the lineup, huh?

279
00:21:29,443 --> 00:21:32,223
None of us want you on the team, man. I don't want you.

280
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:36,734
The guys don't want you. My girlfriend sure as hell doesn’t want you.

281
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:43,171
But here's the deal. You and me, one on one.

282
00:21:44,415 --> 00:21:45,970
You can name the time and place.

283
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:49,826
If you win, I'll quit the team.

284
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,822
If I win, you crawl back in your little hole and you remember your place in all this.

285
00:22:03,686 --> 00:22:07,004
Time and place, baby. Time and place.

286
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:20,184
So, Nathan challenged you. Are you gonna play him?

287
00:22:20,781 --> 00:22:23,536
I don't know. It's not like I have anything to prove.

288
00:22:24,019 --> 00:22:28,247
Yeah, I guess. But don't you just want to show him sometimes -- oh, damn!

289
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:32,783
What is up?! I was attacked by a flock of crows last week!

290
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:34,975
I'm totally serious!

291
00:22:36,097 --> 00:22:39,219
- By the way, it's a murder. 
- What?

292
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:40,985
More than one crow is a murder

293
00:22:41,579 --> 00:22:43,581
I don't know what the hell you're talking about.

294
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,401
A parliament of owls, an exultation of larks, a murder of crows.

295
00:22:48,081 --> 00:22:51,385
I think that is why people think you're weird, right there.

296
00:22:53,387 --> 00:22:57,738
Ah. I would like to show him sometimes, though, what a mistake he's made.

297
00:22:58,409 --> 00:22:59,213
Dan?

298
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:04,677
Mostly for mom... And... sometimes for me.

299
00:23:06,848 --> 00:23:10,293
So, Luke, what are ravens -- I mean, more than one?

300
00:23:11,737 --> 00:23:13,053
An  unkindness.

301
00:23:35,284 --> 00:23:36,483
Why wouldn't you play?

302
00:23:37,055 --> 00:23:38,428
I do play -- every night.

303
00:23:40,589 --> 00:23:42,043
It's not the same, Luke.

304
00:23:42,691 --> 00:23:45,743
Why? What makes it less of a game if people don't see it?

305
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:46,768
I'll tell you why.

306
00:23:48,651 --> 00:23:53,741
When I was a kid, my father took me to Raleigh to see David Thompson play.

307
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:56,855
I was 9 years old. I couldn't have cared less about basketball.

308
00:23:57,116 --> 00:24:02,092
But when Thompson stepped on the court, he was so young,

309
00:24:02,823 --> 00:24:07,054
so quick, and just so graceful that I was mesmerized.

310
00:24:07,734 --> 00:24:10,673
I couldn't take my eyes off him until late in the game,

311
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:14,749
and I look up at my dad, and he's got tears in his eyes.

312
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:20,662
14,000 strangers and my father's crying

313
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:22,957
because he's so beautiful.

314
00:24:24,211 --> 00:24:27,636
He played with such poetry that he made us feel like we were a part of it.

315
00:24:28,806 --> 00:24:30,125
You have a gift, Luke,

316
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:33,714
and it's a crime not to let people see it, to hide it in the park.

317
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:40,641
It's a damn shame. That's why.

318
00:24:44,466 --> 00:24:45,813
Keith 's body shop and towing.

319
00:24:55,168 --> 00:24:56,738
That's me inside your head.

320
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,265
What?

321
00:24:59,713 --> 00:25:00,671
NOFX.

322
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:03,696
That's me inside your head.

323
00:25:04,808 --> 00:25:06,610
- It's the lyrics from... 
- I know the song.

324
00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:22,519
Nathan... It's me. Listen, my car broke down.

325
00:25:23,069 --> 00:25:24,392
You're gonna have to come pick me up.

326
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:26,870
So leave the gym.

327
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,579
Listen, it'll take you, like, 10 minutes.

328
00:25:30,187 --> 00:25:31,984
I'm on River Road around the curve.

329
00:25:33,213 --> 00:25:36,309
Well, sucks to be you.

330
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:47,146
Listen, are you sure you got a ride? I mean, I can wait if you want.

331
00:25:47,412 --> 00:25:49,097
Yeah, that's what I want.

332
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:54,349
Listen, have your dad call me with an estimate.

333
00:25:55,425 --> 00:25:58,123
- My uncle? 
- If that's your story.

334
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:05,357
Can I ask you a question?

335
00:26:06,336 --> 00:26:07,403
It's a free country.

336
00:26:08,118 --> 00:26:09,480
Why are you a cheerleader?

337
00:26:10,432 --> 00:26:13,422
No offense or anything, but you're about the least cheery person I know.

338
00:26:26,130 --> 00:26:27,005
Keith !

339
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:32,837
- Hey, how you been, big brother? 
- Not bad. How about you?

340
00:26:32,996 --> 00:26:37,322
Good, good. Dealership's good. I sent you some business not long ago.

341
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:41,666
Oh, yeah, I... I meant to call you and thank you for that.

342
00:26:42,105 --> 00:26:46,667
- Yeah. Well, we're all busy, right? 
- Right.

343
00:26:51,756 --> 00:26:53,533
Come on. Let me give you a ride.

344
00:26:56,343 --> 00:26:58,018
I'll let you insult me.

345
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:05,350
First of all, you don't know me.

346
00:27:06,476 --> 00:27:09,379
Second of all, you don't know me.

347
00:27:12,169 --> 00:27:14,468
God, why are guys such jerks?!

348
00:27:16,127 --> 00:27:17,376
Guys or Nathan?

349
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:19,373
Him.

350
00:27:20,546 --> 00:27:21,186
You.

351
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:23,525
I don't know.

352
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,079
We share the same father.

353
00:27:26,925 --> 00:27:28,057
Yeah, I heard that.

354
00:27:30,018 --> 00:27:31,252
He's kind of an ass.

355
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:35,414
So that must suck, having to see him around.

356
00:27:35,951 --> 00:27:36,785
For my mom.

357
00:27:38,087 --> 00:27:39,214
I never knew him.

358
00:27:39,607 --> 00:27:42,224
- But she told you he was your dad? 
- Yeah, eventually.

359
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,120
We used to play in junior leagues together -- me and Nathan.

360
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:50,683
- Basketball? 
- Yeah, and I loved it, and I was good at it.

361
00:27:51,379 --> 00:27:54,844
You ever have something that you knew that you were better at than almost anybody else?

362
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:57,594
Sex.

363
00:27:59,909 --> 00:28:00,748
Joke.

364
00:28:03,918 --> 00:28:04,916
Anyway...

365
00:28:06,739 --> 00:28:10,666
Guys kept teasing me about it, about how Nathan’s dad was my dad, too.

366
00:28:11,776 --> 00:28:12,902
So I asked my mom,

367
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,539
and she said he wasn't.

368
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:21,361
But I get home, and I hear her crying in her room.

369
00:28:22,391 --> 00:28:23,507
I knew it was true.

370
00:28:24,557 --> 00:28:25,750
So I never went back.

371
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:30,173
I told my mom it was because I didn't want to have to see his face.

372
00:28:31,131 --> 00:28:35,345
But... it was mostly because...

373
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,102
I didn't want her to have to.

374
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,154
So, why'd you just tell me all that?

375
00:28:48,436 --> 00:28:49,987
I mean, we don't even know each other.

376
00:28:52,614 --> 00:28:53,894
Maybe that's the point.

377
00:29:00,008 --> 00:29:03,048
Nathan's got a shot here, Keith -- a real future.

378
00:29:03,781 --> 00:29:06,680
A real future. Let me ask you something.

379
00:29:07,708 --> 00:29:10,842
Do you ever even think about Lucas' future? Do you ever think about that?

380
00:29:11,287 --> 00:29:14,399
I can't change the fact this kid exists. If I could, I would.

381
00:29:14,717 --> 00:29:17,928
The truth is, I told Karen I’d take care of it. But she --

382
00:30:12,964 --> 00:30:16,009
Tomorrow night, at midnight, at the riverfront.

383
00:30:19,276 --> 00:30:20,960
But if I win, I'm gonna want something else.

384
00:30:31,489 --> 00:30:35,383
I love that car. I love that car. My wife's got that car.

385
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,655
I'm guessing you're not car shopping.

386
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:45,439
He's a boy who wants to play basketball, reluctantly.

387
00:30:45,941 --> 00:30:48,708
I find it horrifying and amusing , then after all this years, 

388
00:30:48,801 --> 00:30:51,308
it takes something as simple as that to bring you around.

389
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:53,856
I'm only thinking of the kid.

390
00:30:53,929 --> 00:30:57,912
You have no right to think of him, not today or any other day of his life. How dare you?

391
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:00,774
- Are you finished? 
- I haven't even started.

392
00:31:00,882 --> 00:31:04,261
We've asked nothing of you, and you have delivered in fine fashion.

393
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:08,260
I'll expect that to continue. If Lucas decides to play, you'll do nothing.

394
00:31:08,347 --> 00:31:10,972
Anything else might make me angry and detract from the pleasant,

395
00:31:11,054 --> 00:31:12,719
cordial side you see now.

396
00:31:13,533 --> 00:31:16,974
You know, I know your son doesn't exactly fit in, but Nathan is all-state,

397
00:31:17,297 --> 00:31:19,847
and I'm not sure why you'd want to humiliate your kid like that.

398
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:24,065
You're right, Dan. I'd rather not humiliate him.

399
00:31:24,362 --> 00:31:26,077
You've done that enough.

400
00:31:33,968 --> 00:31:34,740
Nathan.

401
00:31:36,548 --> 00:31:37,397
What's up, dad?

402
00:31:41,054 --> 00:31:43,105
If I wanted a daughter, I'd adopt one.

403
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:44,715
So you could abandon her, too?

404
00:31:47,484 --> 00:31:48,851
Just a joke, dad.

405
00:31:49,184 --> 00:31:52,235
Yeah. And this bet tonight -- is that a joke, too?

406
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,945
Or would you really quit the team? You have everything to lose here and nothing to gain.

407
00:31:57,524 --> 00:32:00,166
Sometimes what you call "everything," I call "nothing."

408
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:02,302
I just think it's best if you don't do this, Nathan.

409
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:04,218
We'll find another way.

410
00:32:05,175 --> 00:32:06,080
No.

411
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:10,473
Dad, I do a lot of stuff for you --

412
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:12,583
almost everything.

413
00:32:14,421 --> 00:32:15,926
But I'm gonna do this for me.

414
00:32:17,806 --> 00:32:18,828
Hi, Mr. Scott.

415
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,773
So, I would have preferred a warning shot on this one --

416
00:32:27,846 --> 00:32:30,012
something to let me know what was coming with Lucas.

417
00:32:30,098 --> 00:32:34,087
Yeah, that's fair enough. But you should see him play, Karen.

418
00:32:34,144 --> 00:32:37,748
I mean, it's like -- it's like poetry, you know?

419
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,845
- And he's gonna be fine. 
 -Yeah, I know.

420
00:32:41,762 --> 00:32:45,611
Do you ever wonder about it, Keith -- how we got to this?

421
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:51,044
Hanging out in the old cafe, lamenting the past, Haley listening in from behind?

422
00:32:51,156 --> 00:32:52,708
I am not listening.

423
00:32:54,147 --> 00:32:57,168
- Okay, I was. I am. 
- Right.

424
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:01,413
I just wondered how we got here so fast.

425
00:33:01,556 --> 00:33:05,949
I don't know. When I see Lucas in high school, it all seems like a blink of an eye.

426
00:33:06,471 --> 00:33:09,498
But otherwise, it seems like it's been forever.

427
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:19,189
- Wow. 
- Yeah.

428
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,958
This place looks great.

429
00:33:23,062 --> 00:33:25,241
Thanks. I just finished putting up the lights.

430
00:33:25,794 --> 00:33:27,376
Miniature golf is never going to be the same.

431
00:33:29,276 --> 00:33:30,274
Your mom is worried.

432
00:33:30,571 --> 00:33:32,799
She's downstairs with keith picking through her past.

433
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,292
Do you think I’m being selfish playing Nathan?

434
00:33:35,676 --> 00:33:36,342
Do you?

435
00:33:37,785 --> 00:33:38,743
A little bit.

436
00:33:39,635 --> 00:33:43,975
I mean, if I walked away, then my mom wouldn't be downstairs worried about it now.

437
00:33:44,631 --> 00:33:50,668
You know, I don't say things like this very often 'cause it sounds weird, but...

438
00:33:51,707 --> 00:33:55,987
you're a really good guy, and I'm glad we're friends.

439
00:33:57,181 --> 00:33:59,090
But you and your mom worry too damn much.

440
00:34:17,563 --> 00:34:21,690
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to an historic night of basketball.

441
00:34:21,762 --> 00:34:24,962
I'm Mouth McFadden, along with my gamey partner, Jimmy Edwards,

442
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:26,933
and, Jimmy, we're in for a treat tonight.

443
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,590
And who doesn't love a treat, Mouth? I know I do --

444
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:32,129
s'mores, ice cream, cake.

445
00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:36,046
So, if you're not doing it for your dad, then why are you doing it?

446
00:34:36,595 --> 00:34:38,975
- You wouldn't get it. 
- I guess not.

447
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,549
So what if this guy plays? Are you really that threatened?

448
00:34:42,743 --> 00:34:45,472
- I'm not threatened by anyone. 
- Well, then, why do it?

449
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:48,108
To prove I'm the best.

450
00:34:49,236 --> 00:34:51,709
Okay, so, what if he wins? What does he get?

451
00:34:53,173 --> 00:34:54,263
He gets you.

452
00:35:04,032 --> 00:35:07,683
Just moments before the stroke of 12:00, and still no Nathan Scott.

453
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,521
The natives are getting restless, Mouth,

454
00:35:09,575 --> 00:35:12,147
judging by the crowd that envelops our booth.

455
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:13,182
You don't have a booth.

456
00:35:13,371 --> 00:35:16,551
Junk Moreti joins us now. Junk, you care to make a prediction?

457
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:19,402
I predict you guys will be the two biggest morons out here.

458
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:24,139
And it looks like Nathan Scott has arrived, driven by car right onto the court.

459
00:35:36,995 --> 00:35:39,663
By the way, I hope you don't mind, but I told a few people.

460
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:56,160
Come on, let's go, babe! Let's go, Nathan!

461
00:36:04,638 --> 00:36:08,761
Okay, folks, here we go -- 15 by ones. Make it, take it, win by one,

462
00:36:08,827 --> 00:36:11,324
and you can feel the intensity in the air.

463
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:13,978
- You ready for this? 
- Why not?

464
00:36:14,956 --> 00:36:19,374
- It's your life. 
 - Yeah. It is.

465
00:36:26,076 --> 00:36:30,597
Oh-ho! A 25-footer rips the silk like Jimmy Edwards in a size 3 dress.

466
00:36:31,914 --> 00:36:33,501
Go ahead, man. I'll give you that all night.

467
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:45,138
What happened to all night?

468
00:36:49,548 --> 00:36:52,619
Is that all you got, man? If that's all you got, this is over.

469
00:36:56,943 --> 00:36:58,014
Yeah! All right!

470
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:00,059
This looks to be a battle, mouth.

471
00:37:52,374 --> 00:37:54,856
No foul. Basket counts.

472
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:59,773
Besides... you won't score again.

473
00:38:00,582 --> 00:38:04,662
Oh, the basket counts, and it's 14-12, game point for Nathan.

474
00:38:04,785 --> 00:38:06,572
He could win it all right here.

475
00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:09,891
Nathan for the win.

476
00:38:11,912 --> 00:38:14,534
Holy crap! Did you see that?!

477
00:38:14,876 --> 00:38:17,791
Someday men will write stories about that block.

478
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,973
Children will be named after it. Argentinean women will weep for it.

479
00:38:24,881 --> 00:38:26,990
Luke gets a basket, and he's down by one.

480
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:32,116
You're down by one, man. Don't choke now.

481
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,320
- Another dagger, and it's all tied up! 
- I think I'm gonna puke.

482
00:38:39,495 --> 00:38:41,645
Come on, Nate! Come on, shut him down, Nathan!

483
00:38:42,152 --> 00:38:45,300
This is it, folks -- no going back now. The next basket wins it.

484
00:38:46,564 --> 00:38:49,944
He's never mentioned you, man -- not once in all these years.

485
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:52,516
This is for my mom.

486
00:38:59,392 --> 00:39:00,747
Luke for the win!

487
00:39:07,616 --> 00:39:11,147
It's good! Lucas Scott takes it 15-14,

488
00:39:11,218 --> 00:39:14,587
and there is bedlam and delirium and felicity for all!

489
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:43,792
So, what did you bet?

490
00:39:44,427 --> 00:39:47,504
- I win Nathan stays on the team.
- Why?

491
00:39:48,088 --> 00:39:53,495
Because it's the last thing he wants. And anyway, it's not about him.

492
00:39:55,594 --> 00:39:56,376
Peyton.

493
00:40:03,730 --> 00:40:04,923
I'll be seeing you.

494
00:40:16,382 --> 00:40:18,804
There is a tide in the affairs of men...

495
00:40:20,984 --> 00:40:22,429
Which, taken at the flood,

496
00:40:23,887 --> 00:40:25,192
leads on to fortune...

497
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,037
Don't worry, dad.

498
00:40:27,645 --> 00:40:29,140
Your dreams are still safe.

499
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:34,993
But omitted, and the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and miseries...

500
00:40:44,065 --> 00:40:46,237
On such a full sea are we now afloat...

501
00:41:02,708 --> 00:41:05,125
And we must take the current when it serves...

502
00:41:27,258 --> 00:41:29,838
Or lose the ventures before us.
