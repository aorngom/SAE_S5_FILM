1
00:00:00,055 --> 00:00:01,456
<i>Previously, on One Tree Hill...</i>

2
00:00:01,466 --> 00:00:02,675
I guess I was wrong.

3
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:04,550
I'm not the guy for you, Brooke Davis.

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,715
I traded the car for the bike and I made 200 bucks.

5
00:00:07,786 --> 00:00:09,588
Your Mum wants you back in the team.

6
00:00:09,598 --> 00:00:11,670
You have to stay on your medication

7
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,341
and we limit you to 15 minutes a night.

8
00:00:13,351 --> 00:00:14,438
A full scolarship.

9
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,193
Tell coach K, I won't let him down.

10
00:00:16,206 --> 00:00:17,790
Haley! I'm going to Duke.

11
00:00:17,803 --> 00:00:19,243
I'm pregnant.

12
00:00:19,418 --> 00:00:20,589
You're gonna be okay.

13
00:00:20,591 --> 00:00:23,020
I think my dead uncle saved my life.

14
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,103
I killed my brother.

15
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:28,460
He's a part-time model.
You're a 22 years old fashion designer.

16
00:00:28,476 --> 00:00:30,070
- Named Peyton.
- Very funny.

17
00:00:30,085 --> 00:00:32,111
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm...

18
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,392
Peyton.

19
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:36,212
Look, I just have a very bad
feeling about this guy.

20
00:00:36,225 --> 00:00:37,651
Leave me alone!

21
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:38,421
My God!

22
00:00:38,435 --> 00:00:40,922
Don't you know we're supposed
to be together?

23
00:00:43,035 --> 00:00:45,513
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her brother, bitch.

24
00:00:49,496 --> 00:00:52,603
<i>Life comes at us from
out of the darkness...</i>

25
00:00:54,998 --> 00:00:56,273
Peyton!

26
00:00:57,568 --> 00:00:58,863
Peyton!

27
00:01:09,678 --> 00:01:13,322
<i>And at times, we can struggle to find
the courage to face it.</i>

28
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:17,681
Thanks for almost braining me with the keys.

29
00:01:17,696 --> 00:01:21,272
Wow... It's bright.

30
00:01:21,636 --> 00:01:24,620
Yeah, well...
With psycho Derek still out there,

31
00:01:24,637 --> 00:01:27,670
I really haven't been
able to sleep for 48 hours.

32
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:31,112
I thought maybe I'd try to
paint the shadows away...

33
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,133
Can't you talk to your mom?

34
00:01:35,158 --> 00:01:36,150
Maybe she can help.

35
00:01:36,168 --> 00:01:37,361
Come on, Hales, you see my mom.

36
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:39,693
She can't even help herself right now.

37
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:42,360
I hate to say it,
but what about your Dad?

38
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:44,620
Hales, I know that we're in trouble
financially right now,

39
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,391
but, I'm gonna take care of it,
I promise.

40
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:48,243
As soon as the basketball season ends,
I'm gonna get a job,

41
00:01:48,256 --> 00:01:50,280
but I'm not gonna go to my Dad for this.

42
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:53,492
Okay, I'm sorry, it's just...
We're gonna have a family soon,

43
00:01:53,507 --> 00:01:55,962
and I guess I just need
that guy from the press conference

44
00:01:55,976 --> 00:01:58,161
to tell me everything's
gonna be okay again.

45
00:01:58,177 --> 00:01:59,252
It will.

46
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:02,323
Oh, and I know that we're eventually
(hit*) to get a car,

47
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:04,343
so I figured until then...

48
00:02:04,478 --> 00:02:05,601
You could ride with me.

49
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:07,643
I know you don't expect me to wear this.

50
00:02:07,657 --> 00:02:09,461
Come on, it's so "Garden State".

51
00:02:09,475 --> 00:02:12,342
Besides, you were the one that needed
a helmet to ride the motorcycle...

52
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:15,393
Hey! Hey!

53
00:02:15,425 --> 00:02:16,853
No...

54
00:02:20,345 --> 00:02:22,011
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

55
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:25,213
You are a full-on genius

56
00:02:25,226 --> 00:02:26,791
I don't know why you even doubt me.

57
00:02:26,808 --> 00:02:28,322
Just bow down to the master.

58
00:02:28,338 --> 00:02:32,220
Oh, I'm bowing.
I am so crushed out on model boy,

59
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,140
or should I say model man?

60
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,750
You like?

61
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:38,802
Real cultured Tiffany's.
Courtesy of Nick.

62
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:41,980
So, I'm thinking you might be over Lucas,
right about now.

63
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,293
Well, let's see the last thing Lucas
gave me was a mix-tape.

64
00:02:45,308 --> 00:02:47,942
Mix-tape, earings,
mix-tape, earings.

65
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:50,173
I totally owe you one.

66
00:02:52,207 --> 00:02:55,551
Well, take your seats,
I'm your new english teacher, Mr Chavez.

67
00:02:57,328 --> 00:02:58,580
Nick?

68
00:02:58,598 --> 00:02:59,911
Peyton?

69
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:01,522
Here.

70
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:06,533
I have to go to the nurse,
I'm gonna be sick.

71
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:51,540
This is all your fault!

72
00:03:51,555 --> 00:03:53,761
Well? You skanked me into this,

73
00:03:53,776 --> 00:03:54,892
how about you help me out?

74
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:57,173
Hey, I am not the one
that ditch my boyfriend

75
00:03:57,186 --> 00:03:59,541
to have my (horn trimmed)
by her highschool english teacher.

76
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:01,832
Although, I am kind of jealous.

77
00:04:01,845 --> 00:04:04,092
Thank you.  That is very constructive.

78
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:05,861
What am I supposed to do about it now, genius?

79
00:04:05,876 --> 00:04:07,750
I have to see him every day
until I'm graduate.

80
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:09,643
- This is so embarrassing.
- Look...

81
00:04:09,655 --> 00:04:12,801
He's probably just as embarassed
about the situation as you are.

82
00:04:13,968 --> 00:04:17,161
Okay, maybe not that embarassed, but,
bottom line Brooke, you have to deal with him.

83
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:18,553
Deal with him? Deal with him how?

84
00:04:18,566 --> 00:04:19,861
Car crash? Drowning?
What do you suggest?

85
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,753
Look, why don't you just wait
until school is over

86
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:23,520
that way you can talk
to him alone.

87
00:04:23,538 --> 00:04:25,092
I mean, you can't skip school forever.

88
00:04:25,108 --> 00:04:26,473
Oh really? Says who?

89
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:30,363
Why do I need stupid english
for... any...how..?

90
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:36,521
Okay.

91
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,903
Would you do me a favor
and check the hallway

92
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:40,971
to make sure the coast is clear?

93
00:04:49,048 --> 00:04:52,150
Actually...
You might wanna wait a second.

94
00:04:52,165 --> 00:04:55,513
Are we expecting an outbreak
of stalkers and photographers

95
00:04:55,527 --> 00:04:57,910
or you're just ashamed
of being seen with me?

96
00:04:57,928 --> 00:05:00,470
No... Everybody knows.

97
00:05:00,486 --> 00:05:03,032
I guess bad news travel fast.

98
00:05:03,046 --> 00:05:05,152
Are you gonna be okay?

99
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,022
Every time I close my eyes,
I see him there, watching me,

100
00:05:08,038 --> 00:05:09,542
and now, I gotta come to school
and deal with

101
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,243
all of them watching me?

102
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:12,932
Did you try calling your Dad?

103
00:05:12,945 --> 00:05:14,413
No!

104
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:17,230
Look, I know he will come home
the minute I call

105
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:19,330
but what's the point, okay?
It's over.

106
00:05:19,345 --> 00:05:21,050
And there's probably like hundred
Police officers

107
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,553
out there looking for psycho Derek,

108
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:25,092
so, what's my Dad gonna do?

109
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:26,903
Protect you.

110
00:05:27,337 --> 00:05:30,103
- I can take care of myself.
- Eh, I know that.

111
00:05:30,116 --> 00:05:32,072
But it's okay to be afraid
from time to time.

112
00:05:32,085 --> 00:05:33,512
Really?

113
00:05:33,527 --> 00:05:35,492
What are you afraid of?

114
00:05:36,538 --> 00:05:39,953
This morning, I ask Withey
if I could play again.

115
00:05:40,066 --> 00:05:42,460
- That's great, Luke.
- Yeah.

116
00:05:42,477 --> 00:05:46,463
But with my heart condition, it still doesn't
change the fact that it's scary.

117
00:05:46,478 --> 00:05:48,572
Well, then, why are you playing?

118
00:05:48,586 --> 00:05:50,553
Because it's who I am.

119
00:05:50,738 --> 00:05:54,573
And you need to be who you are.

120
00:06:01,297 --> 00:06:02,773
I'm out of here.

121
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:07,552
Wait! Peyton...
If you let this change you...

122
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:10,333
He wins.

123
00:06:10,528 --> 00:06:12,771
Maybe he wins.

124
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:20,080
- Gigi.
- Mouth!

125
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:21,552
- I was just thinking about you.
- Good.

126
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:22,791
You know, now that
we're in the playhouse,

127
00:06:22,805 --> 00:06:25,193
we got to step up our game
for the webcast.

128
00:06:25,206 --> 00:06:27,330
I'm gonna ask you out.

129
00:06:27,507 --> 00:06:29,860
Did you just ask me out?

130
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,081
Like on a date?

131
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:34,272
No, not yet, but...
I'm going to.

132
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,340
I just wanted to let you know.

133
00:06:45,976 --> 00:06:47,920
What do we got here?

134
00:06:47,935 --> 00:06:50,711
The Ravens star riding the bus.

135
00:06:50,728 --> 00:06:52,862
Someone wants to talk to you.

136
00:06:56,785 --> 00:06:58,373
You know me?

137
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,942
I know you.

138
00:07:00,956 --> 00:07:05,502
Nathan Scott. Tree Hill's best
power forward in 15 years.

139
00:07:05,515 --> 00:07:07,170
You have at least 28 points a game.

140
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:09,870
You just recording your fourteenth
triple-double this year.

141
00:07:09,871 --> 00:07:13,071
That, plus a *** jumpshot who
put your old man ashamed.

142
00:07:13,695 --> 00:07:15,761
How am I doing so far?

143
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,490
Pretty good.

144
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,923
Daunte Jones.

145
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,609
Hey.

146
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:23,400
How come you're not signing with Duke?

147
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:25,251
I never say I wasn't.

148
00:07:25,265 --> 00:07:27,071
Good answer.

149
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:30,751
More important question is...
Are we going to state?

150
00:07:31,316 --> 00:07:33,313
You can bet on it.

151
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:36,991
I just might.

152
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:42,592
- You want a ride?
- No, i'm good, thanks.

153
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,713
All right, suit yourself.

154
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,292
Let me give you some advice.

155
00:07:47,855 --> 00:07:50,110
Win State and go to Duke.

156
00:07:50,128 --> 00:07:53,423
This town has been waiting
a long time for a state title.

157
00:07:53,558 --> 00:07:55,771
Too long.

158
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,900
Take care of that knee.

159
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:24,691
If you're not gonna coach, at least
you could mentor the kid a little.

160
00:08:24,706 --> 00:08:28,802
It's a full ride to Duke. It's something
he's been working for all his life.

161
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:31,781
I made that mistake with you.

162
00:08:31,795 --> 00:08:34,691
I'm not gonna make it with Nathan.

163
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,210
Now, if you'll excuse me...

164
00:08:37,228 --> 00:08:40,753
I have a state championship to win.

165
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:47,173
What do you know
about the art on my office wall?

166
00:08:48,837 --> 00:08:52,850
"And he said, what hast thou done?

167
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:58,650
The voice of thy brother's blood
crieth unto me from the ground".

168
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:01,001
Caïn and Abel, Danny.

169
00:09:01,015 --> 00:09:03,420
I know my Bible.

170
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:06,412
The question is...

171
00:09:06,425 --> 00:09:09,283
What's it doing on your wall?

172
00:09:09,295 --> 00:09:11,213
Probably a prank.

173
00:09:11,226 --> 00:09:13,040
It seems someone thinks I mistreated Keith

174
00:09:13,057 --> 00:09:14,391
while he was alive.

175
00:09:14,407 --> 00:09:17,571
We all have to tone for our sins.

176
00:09:17,586 --> 00:09:19,371
What that's supposed to mean?

177
00:09:19,387 --> 00:09:23,702
It means Judgement Day
is waiting for us all.

178
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:30,640
It's a good thing you pray, Whitey.

179
00:09:38,438 --> 00:09:40,170
What are you doing?

180
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:42,231
Just praying he won't kill me.

181
00:09:42,246 --> 00:09:44,641
How does he look?
Does he look mad?

182
00:09:46,776 --> 00:09:49,433
Yes. But in a hot way.

183
00:09:49,446 --> 00:09:50,812
Maybe I should talk to him for you.

184
00:09:50,828 --> 00:09:52,392
Would you? Thanks.

185
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:55,853
Not so fast.

186
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:59,591
All right, look, I sort of have
a lot of experience in this.

187
00:09:59,658 --> 00:10:01,471
He's gonna say you should
have never lied to him,

188
00:10:01,486 --> 00:10:03,590
and that it can't work
cause of the age difference,

189
00:10:03,606 --> 00:10:06,683
then he's gonna say there's no way you two
can be together because he's your teacher.

190
00:10:06,686 --> 00:10:09,752
And then he's gonna yell a lot.
But then it will be over.

191
00:10:09,766 --> 00:10:12,811
Just remember,
if he gets really mad, start crying.

192
00:10:12,828 --> 00:10:14,541
It works every time.

193
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:16,570
See you in the quad.
Good luck.

194
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,741
Hi.

195
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:22,871
Brooke Davis...

196
00:10:23,238 --> 00:10:25,582
18, highschool student.

197
00:10:31,696 --> 00:10:35,520
Okay... I know, I'm sorry.

198
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:40,232
I should have told you the truth
about how old I am and who I am but...

199
00:10:40,245 --> 00:10:42,351
We met and we went out and I liked you.

200
00:10:42,365 --> 00:10:43,703
I just didn't know...

201
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,881
You shouldn't have lied.

202
00:10:49,896 --> 00:10:51,360
I know.

203
00:10:51,635 --> 00:10:54,083
We really can't do this, right?

204
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:56,311
Right.

205
00:11:06,007 --> 00:11:07,740
You said you were 23.

206
00:11:07,858 --> 00:11:10,140
- You said you were a model.
- Part-time, but full-time,

207
00:11:10,156 --> 00:11:12,710
I'm your teacher so, we really can't do this.

208
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:15,881
Absolutely not.

209
00:11:16,635 --> 00:11:19,410
But, if we were to do this...

210
00:11:19,648 --> 00:11:21,702
We'll have to make sure
that no one knows.

211
00:11:21,728 --> 00:11:22,752
No one.

212
00:11:22,766 --> 00:11:24,531
Not a soul.

213
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:27,261
If, we were to do this.

214
00:11:29,145 --> 00:11:31,071
I won't tell if you want.

215
00:11:31,086 --> 00:11:32,512
Done.

216
00:11:40,196 --> 00:11:42,382
Look who are all up in my house, dog.

217
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:45,820
Oh my God, you have one decent game
and all of a sudden it's your house.

218
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:48,420
I heard a rumor you might
be coming of the banch into playoff.

219
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:49,791
Eh, is that true, Luke?

220
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:51,371
It's true my friends.

221
00:11:51,385 --> 00:11:52,951
I'm back.

222
00:11:53,466 --> 00:11:54,782
Okay.

223
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:56,922
Me and my boy back together again.

224
00:11:56,935 --> 00:11:58,972
40 minutes a night,
in the big time.

225
00:11:58,986 --> 00:12:00,880
Actually, Whitey only give me 15 minutes
a game, you know,

226
00:12:00,897 --> 00:12:02,793
due to my heart condition.

227
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:07,133
So...

228
00:12:07,636 --> 00:12:10,052
I guess you'll be
wanting this back.

229
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:16,890
Since you started this year
with it, you keep it.

230
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:18,871
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

231
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,381
Cool.

232
00:12:20,528 --> 00:12:23,301
All right, look, game in 21.

233
00:12:23,315 --> 00:12:24,953
Make it, take it.

234
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:28,003
In your case,
Mr 15 minutes man,

235
00:12:28,425 --> 00:12:30,341
we're going to make
the game 11.

236
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:31,871
All right.

237
00:12:51,796 --> 00:12:53,382
Mouth, what are you doing?

238
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:56,312
Gigi wants to go out with me.

239
00:12:56,326 --> 00:12:57,910
Gigi's cute.

240
00:12:58,048 --> 00:12:59,960
Well, I don't really think about
her in that way.

241
00:12:59,978 --> 00:13:02,250
I mean, I really
don't even know her, but...

242
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:04,261
I don't want to heart her feelings.

243
00:13:04,296 --> 00:13:06,121
What should I do?

244
00:13:06,288 --> 00:13:09,301
Oh, I'm not the relationship
expert this days, trust me.

245
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:12,713
But, you're smart, Mouth,
you'll figure it out.

246
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:15,193
And 'ever you do, just be nice.

247
00:13:24,317 --> 00:13:25,572
So?

248
00:13:26,885 --> 00:13:29,030
You were right, it was...

249
00:13:29,165 --> 00:13:31,483
Really intense.

250
00:13:31,685 --> 00:13:33,391
So it's over?

251
00:13:35,088 --> 00:13:36,973
Yeah, it's over.

252
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:44,910
It's over the limit?

253
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:48,242
Are you sure?
Can you just check again?

254
00:13:50,106 --> 00:13:51,402
Yeah.

255
00:13:51,546 --> 00:13:52,712
Okay.

256
00:13:52,726 --> 00:13:55,340
No, yeah. thanks.

257
00:13:55,645 --> 00:13:57,001
Everything okay?

258
00:13:57,015 --> 00:13:59,591
I tried to use our credit card
this morning and it was denied.

259
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:02,593
And now the card compagny's telling
me we're over our limit.

260
00:14:02,606 --> 00:14:04,600
Have you talked about this with Nathan?

261
00:14:04,616 --> 00:14:08,272
Sort of, but he, he just says
everything is gonna be okay.

262
00:14:08,285 --> 00:14:10,362
Karen,
If we can't make ends meet now,

263
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,100
what are we gonna
do when the baby comes?

264
00:14:12,118 --> 00:14:14,143
Okay, all right, let's not panic.

265
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:16,993
You know, if it's more else working,
I can help you out with that.

266
00:14:17,005 --> 00:14:19,960
You know, mornings before school
or nights, whatever.

267
00:14:19,977 --> 00:14:21,763
Yeah, okay.

268
00:14:22,218 --> 00:14:24,830
If you need a short lean on or someone to talk to,

269
00:14:24,846 --> 00:14:26,990
I can help you with that too.

270
00:14:27,146 --> 00:14:31,280
After all, I am the expert
on teenage pregnancy.

271
00:14:42,578 --> 00:14:44,922
Pretty dark, don't you think?

272
00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:46,530
I love you, Luke.

273
00:14:46,545 --> 00:14:48,611
But I've chosen darkness.

274
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:52,121
Well, I just want to
come check up on you, girly.

275
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:53,952
How's your head?

276
00:14:54,197 --> 00:14:56,211
Is that me...

277
00:14:56,516 --> 00:14:59,213
Or I'm the reason people always leave?

278
00:14:59,695 --> 00:15:03,760
Or I'm the reason all
this things keep hapening to me?

279
00:15:03,895 --> 00:15:06,603
Maybe I'm just destined to be alone.

280
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:08,152
It's not you.

281
00:15:08,167 --> 00:15:10,242
And you're not alone.

282
00:15:11,735 --> 00:15:14,380
But eventually you gonna have to be.

283
00:15:15,555 --> 00:15:17,302
No, you're right, I can do it.

284
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:18,300
All right.

285
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:21,722
But just in case,
you have a key to my place,

286
00:15:21,935 --> 00:15:24,523
and I'm just a phone call away.

287
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,080
Thanks.

288
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,531
Where are you going?

289
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:55,621
I just need to get a workout
so I'm going for a run.

290
00:15:55,636 --> 00:15:58,652
You're gonna have to run
a marathon to take care of that ass.

291
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,392
- Hey.
- Hi.

292
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:34,551
I'm sorry. I tried.

293
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:43,601
Have you talked to your brother?

294
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:48,770
He won't call me back.

295
00:16:48,835 --> 00:16:51,580
He's like a Marine or something.

296
00:16:54,145 --> 00:16:56,242
Can I stay?

297
00:16:59,888 --> 00:17:01,533
Sure.

298
00:17:24,247 --> 00:17:26,273
Good thing to deal with an old friend.

299
00:17:26,285 --> 00:17:29,383
Seems he wasn't aware that our star
forward had a pregnant wife.

300
00:17:29,397 --> 00:17:30,793
Yeah, when he heard
about your situation,

301
00:17:30,805 --> 00:17:32,692
he was happy to take
your bike back in trade.

302
00:17:32,705 --> 00:17:35,033
Thanks, but I can't
accept this from you.

303
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,221
NCAA rules.

304
00:17:36,236 --> 00:17:37,561
Nathan, it's your car.

305
00:17:37,578 --> 00:17:39,701
There's no money
changing hands here.

306
00:17:39,715 --> 00:17:42,603
Just consider this the Tree Hill
alumni lending an helping hand.

307
00:17:42,616 --> 00:17:45,601
It's what you're calling yourself
these days, alumni?

308
00:17:46,226 --> 00:17:49,970
Why do you go ruin a perfectly
good gesture by making me feel bad?

309
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:51,932
Just take the car.

310
00:17:52,327 --> 00:17:54,552
What am I gonna do
with that piece of crap?

311
00:17:55,338 --> 00:17:59,021
You know, Nate... as Ravens guys,
stick together.

312
00:18:01,957 --> 00:18:03,643
Daunte...

313
00:18:07,057 --> 00:18:08,452
Thanks.

314
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:29,713
I love working for Uncle Sam!

315
00:18:29,727 --> 00:18:32,893
I love working for Uncle Sam!

316
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:36,121
Let's my know just who I am.

317
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:39,293
Let's my know just who I am.

318
00:18:39,307 --> 00:18:40,672
One, two, three, four...

319
00:18:40,685 --> 00:18:42,400
One, two, three...

320
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:52,582
Left face!

321
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:55,971
Strauss, continue the run please!

322
00:18:58,495 --> 00:18:59,723
I tried to call you.

323
00:18:59,737 --> 00:19:01,181
I know.

324
00:19:01,196 --> 00:19:04,312
Look, it's Peyton.
She's not doing well.

325
00:19:04,326 --> 00:19:06,342
And remind me why this is my concern?

326
00:19:06,356 --> 00:19:07,460
She's your sister.

327
00:19:07,475 --> 00:19:08,733
I don't even know her.

328
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,351
And to be honest,
if this introduction was any indication

329
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,242
of what her side of
the family might be like,

330
00:19:13,256 --> 00:19:14,803
I'll pass.

331
00:19:14,965 --> 00:19:17,150
Look, with Ellie gone, you're the only
family she's got.

332
00:19:17,168 --> 00:19:19,000
Look around you, Scott.

333
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:21,942
We deal with some pretty
serious situations here.

334
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,920
Life threatening type situations, so...

335
00:19:23,938 --> 00:19:26,602
You'll have to excuse me if I don't have time

336
00:19:26,616 --> 00:19:28,330
for your highschool dramas.

337
00:19:28,347 --> 00:19:29,951
Come on, man!

338
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:31,973
She needs your help.

339
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:33,901
I need your help.

340
00:19:33,917 --> 00:19:35,983
When I started my first tour overseas,

341
00:19:35,997 --> 00:19:38,633
I made it a point to get to know
all the guys in my unit

342
00:19:38,646 --> 00:19:41,071
because they also needed help.

343
00:19:41,086 --> 00:19:43,312
But, it's a war

344
00:19:43,325 --> 00:19:45,290
and people die.

345
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:49,901
So, after a while, I learned to
stop getting to know the new guys.

346
00:19:49,917 --> 00:19:51,883
It was just easier that way.

347
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:53,823
Sorry you made the trip...

348
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:55,253
But I can't help you.

349
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:59,000
You travel half way around the world
to fight for a complete stranger...

350
00:19:59,728 --> 00:20:03,742
but you don't have it in your heart
to fight for your own flesh and blood.

351
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,710
Hey, sorry.

352
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:19,493
Haley, you're late.
And where is Peyton?

353
00:20:19,508 --> 00:20:21,411
I know, I'm sorry
I had to close up the cafe.

354
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,753
Peyton didn't even come to school today.

355
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:24,190
I think cheerleading
is out of question.

356
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:27,342
Well, she lets one little stalker into her
life, and we all get screwed, that's nice.

357
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:29,951
Brooke, some of us actually
have real problems.

358
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,432
Fine.

359
00:20:32,485 --> 00:20:34,062
How is she doing?

360
00:20:34,078 --> 00:20:35,552
Honestly, I don't think,
she's doing that well,

361
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:37,750
and it would kind of
be nice if you knew that.

362
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:41,390
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you
guys used to be like best friends?

363
00:20:41,408 --> 00:20:43,630
- What are you gonna do with this?
- Don't ask me, okay?

364
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,573
I'm not the bitch who started it.

365
00:20:45,588 --> 00:20:47,392
Okay well, while we're
dealing with all things Brooke,

366
00:20:47,405 --> 00:20:48,981
somebody left a message for you
at the apartment

367
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:52,020
about styling
a fashion show or something...

368
00:20:52,036 --> 00:20:53,263
What?

369
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:55,172
Why didn't they just call me?

370
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:57,453
I don't know. Maybe because
you move from house to house

371
00:20:57,468 --> 00:20:59,861
like a little nomady camel.
I saved the message.

372
00:20:59,876 --> 00:21:02,203
Thank you. Oh, Haley...

373
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:05,730
Just don't tell Peyton
I asked about her, okay?

374
00:21:05,878 --> 00:21:07,460
Okay.

375
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:17,161
Uh, you wanted to see me, coach?

376
00:21:17,178 --> 00:21:18,910
Yeah, come on in, son.

377
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,621
This is Keith's number.

378
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:33,153
I'm pretty sure
he'd want you to have it.

379
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:36,501
- You're taking your medications?
- Yes, sir.

380
00:21:36,557 --> 00:21:37,962
Good.

381
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:39,793
You know...

382
00:21:39,808 --> 00:21:44,091
It took every ounce of strength
your mother has to come in here

383
00:21:44,107 --> 00:21:46,772
and ask me to take you back.

384
00:21:47,035 --> 00:21:48,840
She loves you that much.

385
00:21:48,856 --> 00:21:52,292
Enough to put your dreams
ahead of her fears.

386
00:21:52,575 --> 00:21:56,401
You've got 15 minutes
a game to make her proud.

387
00:21:57,626 --> 00:22:02,212
And a lifetime
to make them both proud.

388
00:22:05,976 --> 00:22:08,560
All right, fans,
the close season is on the way.

389
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,500
If the Ravens can win
the next five games,

390
00:22:10,518 --> 00:22:12,050
they'll be state champions.

391
00:22:12,068 --> 00:22:14,620
But lose one, and the season is over.

392
00:22:15,146 --> 00:22:17,613
Nathan Scott, ***!

393
00:22:19,325 --> 00:22:25,460
The triple threat of Antoine Skills Taylor and
Scott brothers, Nathan and Lucas, are unstoppable.

394
00:22:26,075 --> 00:22:28,290
Ravens by 10.

395
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:39,140
Lucas Scott has become the Ravens
secret weapon of the 'Vens.

396
00:22:39,156 --> 00:22:41,780
They swing it over to Skills Taylor.

397
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,363
Skills, with the sweet
River Court move for 2.

398
00:22:47,375 --> 00:22:49,103
Smell like **** baby.
bar white toast

399
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,750
Ravens 84,
Bear Creek 62.

400
00:22:51,765 --> 00:22:53,701
The Ravens win in advance.

401
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:55,831
Bear Creek season is over.

402
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,950
The Ravens ***** dominate
force on this playoff since

403
00:23:12,968 --> 00:23:15,161
the Scott brothers
are on their own.

404
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,470
Luke works the ball to Skills.

405
00:23:18,115 --> 00:23:20,022
Skills gives the alley-oop to Nathan,

406
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:22,273
and Nathan drives it home.

407
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:35,570
Long range from Lucas Scott.

408
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:37,133
Ravens are up by 15 now,

409
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:41,201
and that is the magic number as Coach
Durham calls it a night for number 22.

410
00:23:41,218 --> 00:23:43,493
That also looks like the end of the road
for the Cove City Cougars

411
00:23:43,506 --> 00:23:45,491
as the Ravens Coast to an easy win.

412
00:23:45,508 --> 00:23:46,450
Gigi?

413
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,811
Dinner or... a movie?

414
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:50,972
When I ask you out.

415
00:23:53,578 --> 00:23:57,023
And the Ravens advance
to the state quarter-finals.

416
00:24:17,675 --> 00:24:20,571
Skills Taylor brings
the ball up-court,

417
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:23,233
he finds Nathan Scott
with a no look pass.

418
00:24:23,247 --> 00:24:26,453
Nathan lays it in and
the Ravens have a huge (meet?)

419
00:24:27,945 --> 00:24:31,072
Whitey Durham can feel it,
this is over.

420
00:24:34,908 --> 00:24:38,351
Don't look now folks, but if
Tree Hill can win one more game,

421
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:41,233
they'll be playing for
the state championship.

422
00:24:41,388 --> 00:24:43,833
The fans are on their feet,
and they should be.

423
00:24:43,845 --> 00:24:46,671
I'll tell you what,
this could be the best Ravens'...

424
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:55,671
- Yes!
- Yes!

425
00:24:55,687 --> 00:24:58,503
One more game and we are
in the state championship.

426
00:24:58,977 --> 00:25:02,381
Not so fast Hales, I mean, we still got
Verona, and they're pretty tough.

427
00:25:02,397 --> 00:25:04,620
Oh yeah, but between
you, Lucas, and Skills,

428
00:25:04,635 --> 00:25:06,953
nothing's gonna stop us now.

429
00:25:09,028 --> 00:25:11,720
Oh, maybe I spoke too soon.

430
00:25:14,738 --> 00:25:17,821
Nathan, it's just our lights,
what's going on?

431
00:25:17,837 --> 00:25:19,451
I guess that was
our third notice.

432
00:25:19,465 --> 00:25:21,631
Oh God, Nathan, we...

433
00:25:22,217 --> 00:25:24,273
As much as I hate
to say this, I really think

434
00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:26,441
it's time you talk
to your Dad.

435
00:25:41,037 --> 00:25:43,893
I hope you're here to tell me
you're signing with Duke.

436
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,561
I'm not here to
talk about basketball.

437
00:25:48,407 --> 00:25:51,130
I'm having money problems, Dad.

438
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:54,101
It's serious and...
I need your help.

439
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:55,943
You know, Nathan...

440
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:59,770
It broke my heart when you emancipated
yourself and turned away from me as a father.

441
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:01,851
God knows I tried to be there for you.

442
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:04,663
But you're married,
and you're a man now.

443
00:26:04,755 --> 00:26:07,472
My sole wish for you
is that you find your way.

444
00:26:07,486 --> 00:26:09,653
But you're gonna have
to do that on you're own.

445
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,273
So you're saying
you're not gonna help me,

446
00:26:11,288 --> 00:26:12,232
not at all.

447
00:26:12,245 --> 00:26:15,012
No, what I'm saying is,
whenever I invest money,

448
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:17,971
I look on the potential
for return on that money.

449
00:26:17,987 --> 00:26:20,551
Right now, you're not
an investement I'm interested in.

450
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:21,850
But I'm your son.

451
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:24,983
Really?
I thought you were emancipated.

452
00:26:33,628 --> 00:26:36,672
Thanks for nothing... Dad.

453
00:26:49,068 --> 00:26:50,502
Haley.

454
00:26:51,216 --> 00:26:54,451
I don't know if
I can have this baby, Karen.

455
00:26:58,396 --> 00:26:59,960
What do you mean?

456
00:27:01,156 --> 00:27:04,292
They shut the power
off last night, and...

457
00:27:05,448 --> 00:27:08,102
I'm the only one
of us with a job,

458
00:27:08,118 --> 00:27:10,850
and I'm pregnant,
and I'm in high school.

459
00:27:10,985 --> 00:27:13,880
And Nathan is this close
to getting his basketball scolarship,

460
00:27:13,897 --> 00:27:16,460
but he can't do that
and have time for a job,

461
00:27:16,477 --> 00:27:20,483
and I really have no idea
how this is gonna work out, Karen.

462
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:26,610
Haley, when I was your age,
and I was pregnant with Lucas,

463
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:29,091
I didn't have two pennies
(stripped?) together,

464
00:27:29,108 --> 00:27:31,612
I didn't have any friends,
I didn't have college,

465
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:34,402
matter of fact, I didn't
even have a family.

466
00:27:35,257 --> 00:27:38,673
That doesn't really make
me feel better, Karen.

467
00:27:38,685 --> 00:27:40,673
Look at you!

468
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:45,100
You have a great support system,
and friends, and family...

469
00:27:45,115 --> 00:27:46,892
You have a future
ahead of you in college,

470
00:27:46,906 --> 00:27:51,051
but most of all, you have Nathan.

471
00:27:53,865 --> 00:27:56,622
It's sure it's not
gonna be easy,

472
00:27:56,725 --> 00:27:58,991
but you gotta have faith.

473
00:28:02,398 --> 00:28:04,340
Trust me.

474
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:06,851
You can do this.

475
00:28:10,477 --> 00:28:12,141
You can do this.

476
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,002
So let me get this straight.

477
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:19,230
You and Peyton are just friends,
right?

478
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:23,983
I wish I had friends like that.

479
00:28:29,616 --> 00:28:31,292
Derek, hey.

480
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,720
Skills, this is
Peyton's brother, Derek.

481
00:28:35,395 --> 00:28:36,712
Hey.

482
00:28:36,727 --> 00:28:40,263
Who would have guessed
Peyton's brother... was a brother.

483
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:41,980
Caporal Sommers.

484
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:43,663
Big Daddy Skills.

485
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,161
- I wanted to talk to you about...
- Luke...

486
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:49,641
Peyton.

487
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:51,180
I'll leave you to it.

488
00:28:51,197 --> 00:28:52,540
Thank you.

489
00:28:59,615 --> 00:29:01,632
I tried calling you.

490
00:29:01,957 --> 00:29:04,590
I wasn't sure
I wanted to see you.

491
00:29:04,656 --> 00:29:06,112
Like the first time
I called you

492
00:29:06,125 --> 00:29:07,751
and you hanged up on me...

493
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:10,310
A simple thank you
would suffice.

494
00:29:10,937 --> 00:29:13,760
I was the victim, okay?
It wasn't my fault.

495
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:16,633
Well, there's your first problem,
right there. Thinking like a victim.

496
00:29:16,648 --> 00:29:18,033
Don't.

497
00:29:18,225 --> 00:29:21,643
Don't judge me, 'cause
you don't know the first thing about me.

498
00:29:21,786 --> 00:29:23,463
You're right.

499
00:29:24,357 --> 00:29:25,963
Let's change that.

500
00:29:25,978 --> 00:29:27,421
Take a ride with me.

501
00:29:27,437 --> 00:29:29,380
Give me one good reason
why I should.

502
00:29:29,395 --> 00:29:32,051
Because right now,
I'm the only family you got.

503
00:29:35,327 --> 00:29:38,440
And if you don't mind me criticizing
your personal apparence,

504
00:29:38,455 --> 00:29:41,081
one of these days
you're gonna have to sleep.

505
00:29:56,126 --> 00:29:58,053
You're not really what
I expected.

506
00:29:58,065 --> 00:29:59,761
What do you mean?

507
00:29:59,937 --> 00:30:03,491
Well, I don't know,
I just expected someone...

508
00:30:03,507 --> 00:30:04,661
I thought you'd be more like...

509
00:30:04,676 --> 00:30:05,951
More white.

510
00:30:06,076 --> 00:30:09,300
No! That's not
what I meant.

511
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:11,462
Maybe it's the Marine part.

512
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,483
My mother is african-american.

513
00:30:13,606 --> 00:30:16,683
And as far as the Marines goes,
this place saved my life.

514
00:30:16,697 --> 00:30:18,833
When I was just
a little younger than you,

515
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:23,633
my dad... our dad,
he left me and my mum.

516
00:30:24,346 --> 00:30:27,361
Well, it figures, looks like
the boy was right about one thing,

517
00:30:27,376 --> 00:30:28,951
we got a dead-beat dad.

518
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:30,610
This is tough.

519
00:30:30,626 --> 00:30:34,241
She worked two jobs,
and that left me pretty much on my own.

520
00:30:34,258 --> 00:30:36,273
I started getting into trouble.

521
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,490
Nothing horrible, but
nothing I'm proud of either.

522
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,332
What I didn't know at the time
was that mostly, I was just scared.

523
00:30:43,347 --> 00:30:46,833
This place showed me
how to not be scared.

524
00:30:47,488 --> 00:30:51,021
Fear is like a disease, so if you
don't treat it, it'll eat you up.

525
00:30:51,038 --> 00:30:51,990
All right. But guess what?

526
00:30:52,008 --> 00:30:54,720
The last Derek I trusted...
Tried to kill me.

527
00:30:54,737 --> 00:30:56,471
I didn't say it would be easy.

528
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:58,482
Do you think this is easy for me?

529
00:30:58,496 --> 00:31:00,131
I didn't asked for anyone
new in my life.

530
00:31:00,147 --> 00:31:01,740
- Then why are you helping me?
- Because your friend Lucas

531
00:31:01,758 --> 00:31:03,781
cared enough to convince me.

532
00:31:04,137 --> 00:31:06,790
I'm looking at you,
I see that fear.

533
00:31:06,806 --> 00:31:08,972
But I also see strength.

534
00:31:10,386 --> 00:31:11,790
Come on.

535
00:31:19,775 --> 00:31:21,682
Hold it up, okay?

536
00:31:21,905 --> 00:31:23,463
Remind me why I'm
doing this again.

537
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:25,382
Because it's one of my dresses for TART.

538
00:31:25,397 --> 00:31:26,402
TART?

539
00:31:26,415 --> 00:31:30,543
Textile Art Rude Tour. It's a touring
fashion show to showcase new designers.

540
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,090
And a designer dropped out, and now
I'm in, but I'm running out of time...

541
00:31:34,107 --> 00:31:35,203
so chop chop.

542
00:31:35,218 --> 00:31:36,610
What do I get in return?

543
00:31:36,626 --> 00:31:40,222
Well, you're helping me with my work,
so I could help you with yours.

544
00:31:40,236 --> 00:31:44,101
I could grade your important
papers, give Peyton an F...

545
00:31:44,116 --> 00:31:46,542
I was thinking something
a little more...

546
00:31:46,647 --> 00:31:48,342
Physical...

547
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:53,090
So that's all this is about
for you? Sex?

548
00:31:53,108 --> 00:31:54,932
Of course not.

549
00:31:55,557 --> 00:31:57,603
Well, what is it then?

550
00:31:57,617 --> 00:32:01,590
I mean, nobody knows we're together,
all we do is sneak around,

551
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:04,872
not that there's anything wrong
with sneaking around, but...

552
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,161
What's it about if
it's not just sex?

553
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:09,952
I know it's not fair to you Brooke.

554
00:32:09,967 --> 00:32:13,580
Maybe you're right,
maybe we should stop this.

555
00:32:14,305 --> 00:32:15,851
You could do that?

556
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:17,950
I don't want to hurt you.

557
00:32:18,657 --> 00:32:20,022
Ouch!

558
00:32:20,318 --> 00:32:22,322
Care to revise that answer?

559
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:23,961
How about this...

560
00:32:24,167 --> 00:32:26,470
In 3 months,
you'll be done with school...

561
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:28,421
and then it doesn't matter
what anyone thinks.

562
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:31,170
And the world can know,
and it will be just about us.

563
00:32:31,185 --> 00:32:32,361
You and me.

564
00:32:32,375 --> 00:32:35,371
Yeah, that's a good answer.
You get an A.

565
00:32:35,476 --> 00:32:37,183
Now old this.

566
00:32:38,548 --> 00:32:41,032
Looks like we're a little
early for smack-down.

567
00:32:41,385 --> 00:32:44,031
We have a boxing team on base.

568
00:32:44,728 --> 00:32:47,671
Well, you better watch out
for my right hook.

569
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:49,532
You think so?

570
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:51,153
Thanks.

571
00:32:53,118 --> 00:32:54,623
Okay.

572
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:56,813
Let's see it.

573
00:32:57,127 --> 00:32:58,471
Right.

574
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,992
I'm serious. Hit me.

575
00:33:01,008 --> 00:33:02,823
Forget it. This is weird.

576
00:33:02,836 --> 00:33:05,320
The first step in learning
how not to be scared,

577
00:33:05,335 --> 00:33:07,382
is knowing how to defend yourself.

578
00:33:07,437 --> 00:33:10,920
- Come on. Hit me.
- I'm not gonna hit you, okay?

579
00:33:16,698 --> 00:33:18,181
Derek...

580
00:33:18,648 --> 00:33:20,051
Stop!

581
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:22,663
Is that all you got?

582
00:33:22,927 --> 00:33:25,780
Punch me like you mean it, Sawyer.

583
00:33:27,097 --> 00:33:28,321
You hit like a girl.

584
00:33:28,337 --> 00:33:29,541
I am a girl.

585
00:33:29,556 --> 00:33:33,590
A weak, scared,
defenseless little girl.

586
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,790
Okay, Sawyer,

587
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:40,320
so there's actually
a real person in there.

588
00:33:40,338 --> 00:33:41,703
Again.

589
00:33:42,765 --> 00:33:44,501
Hands up.

590
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:47,433
Yeah!

591
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:49,341
You're scared, uh?

592
00:33:49,357 --> 00:33:50,940
You wanna act like
a little baby, and cry,

593
00:33:50,956 --> 00:33:52,280
and stay in the house
all the time?

594
00:33:52,298 --> 00:33:53,591
No.

595
00:33:53,605 --> 00:33:54,813
Shut up.

596
00:33:55,098 --> 00:33:56,451
Picture, Peyton...

597
00:33:56,465 --> 00:33:58,303
Picture everything that hurts
you, and fight it back.

598
00:33:58,315 --> 00:34:00,300
Yeah, fight back! Yeah!

599
00:34:00,317 --> 00:34:03,212
Yeah, fight back, yeah!

600
00:34:04,828 --> 00:34:05,980
Yeah, yeah.

601
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:11,632
Yeah, yeah, fight back.

602
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,243
Yeah, fight back!

603
00:34:26,695 --> 00:34:27,970
Shut up!

604
00:34:53,048 --> 00:34:55,450
Okay, this Gigi thing
is a DEFCON 5.

605
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:57,291
- You gotta help me for this.
- Okay.

606
00:34:57,306 --> 00:34:59,172
The blow-off 101,
let's review.

607
00:34:59,187 --> 00:35:01,010
One, you can't date her right now,

608
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:02,372
but it's not her, it's you.

609
00:35:02,388 --> 00:35:03,941
Two, you're so messed up right now,

610
00:35:03,956 --> 00:35:05,181
she'd be miserable dating you.

611
00:35:05,196 --> 00:35:08,562
Three, there are way better guys
she could have in her life,

612
00:35:08,577 --> 00:35:11,331
and forth, are you ready for this?

613
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:15,212
Dating would ruin
your really special friendship.

614
00:35:15,225 --> 00:35:17,652
But listen Mouth, if she gets bummed when
you tell her you wanna be good friends,

615
00:35:17,665 --> 00:35:19,773
then tell her you wanna be
great friends, okay?

616
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:22,561
Mouth, are you listening?

617
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:24,043
It's okay.

618
00:35:24,058 --> 00:35:26,352
I've already heard this speech.

619
00:35:31,168 --> 00:35:32,630
Hey, Mouth.

620
00:35:32,646 --> 00:35:34,981
Gigi, I know you wanna
ask me out,

621
00:35:34,997 --> 00:35:37,381
but I don't want you to.

622
00:35:38,028 --> 00:35:39,761
Because...

623
00:35:39,776 --> 00:35:42,370
I wanna ask you out.

624
00:35:44,706 --> 00:35:47,202
Uh... I'll have to think about it,

625
00:35:47,218 --> 00:35:49,572
and get back to you.

626
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:57,573
Okay, I've thought about it and...
I'd love to go out with you Mouth.

627
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:05,801
<i>When life comes rushing at you
from out of the darkness,</i>

628
00:36:05,816 --> 00:36:08,673
<i>who will you chose
to face it with?</i>

629
00:36:08,975 --> 00:36:11,032
<i>Will it be someone you trust?</i>

630
00:36:11,045 --> 00:36:13,900
What are we gonna do Nathan,
if we...

631
00:36:15,395 --> 00:36:17,662
I took care of it.

632
00:36:20,398 --> 00:36:23,712
I know that must have been really
difficult for you to talk to your father,

633
00:36:23,725 --> 00:36:26,093
thank you for doing that for me.

634
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:35,232
Thank you for doing that for us.

635
00:36:39,736 --> 00:36:41,803
<i>Burning the midnight oil, killer?</i>

636
00:36:47,987 --> 00:36:49,422
<i>Who is this?</i>

637
00:36:51,857 --> 00:36:53,683
<i>I know what you did.</i>

638
00:37:01,848 --> 00:37:04,002
<i>Will they be wise?</i>

639
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:05,731
Oh, what's that for?

640
00:37:05,747 --> 00:37:07,381
Because you were right.

641
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:11,403
I have a great future
and I have great friends,

642
00:37:11,418 --> 00:37:13,700
and I have the best husband.

643
00:37:13,945 --> 00:37:16,633
You know what I'm
really thankful for?

644
00:37:16,647 --> 00:37:18,782
I have you.

645
00:37:32,106 --> 00:37:34,010
How's our star player doing?

646
00:37:34,026 --> 00:37:34,923
Good.

647
00:37:34,937 --> 00:37:37,192
And thanks man,
I know that was a lot of money,

648
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:39,650
but I'm gonna pay you back.
Every cent.

649
00:37:39,668 --> 00:37:41,482
Take your time.

650
00:37:41,498 --> 00:37:44,163
Just don't disappoint me
out there, Nate.

651
00:37:48,098 --> 00:37:49,681
<i>And will their love for you</i>

652
00:37:49,697 --> 00:37:52,280
<i>help them to guide
you to the light?</i>

653
00:37:53,165 --> 00:37:56,682
<i>Or will they lose their
way in the darkness?</i>

654
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:45,621
<i>Will they make noble choices?</i>

655
00:38:47,785 --> 00:38:51,112
<i>Or will that person be
someone untested?</i>

656
00:38:51,285 --> 00:38:53,452
<i>Someone new...</i>

657
00:38:57,836 --> 00:38:59,463
So you're living?

658
00:38:59,477 --> 00:39:02,472
I know we're related Peyton,
and maybe in another life

659
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:03,473
we'd be closer, but...

660
00:39:04,174 --> 00:39:05,174
I'm a Marine,

661
00:39:04,185 --> 00:39:06,821
and you've got your own life.

662
00:39:06,836 --> 00:39:08,901
I can't be that guy for you.

663
00:39:09,717 --> 00:39:11,702
Why not?

664
00:39:12,947 --> 00:39:15,080
I guess what I'm saying is I...

665
00:39:15,095 --> 00:39:17,241
I don't wanna be that guy.

666
00:39:17,735 --> 00:39:19,600
I'm sorry.

667
00:39:54,546 --> 00:39:57,513
You can take a pass on tonight,
she's gonna be fine.

668
00:39:58,057 --> 00:40:00,142
- You sure?
- No.

669
00:40:00,157 --> 00:40:03,171
But if you keep babying her,
you'll never find out.

670
00:40:03,228 --> 00:40:05,603
Look, you know you should
really get to know her.

671
00:40:05,616 --> 00:40:07,642
She needs someone special
in her life, you know...

672
00:40:07,657 --> 00:40:10,172
She's already got someone
special in her life.

673
00:40:10,185 --> 00:40:11,890
She has you.

674
00:40:12,386 --> 00:40:14,263
Thanks, Scott.

675
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:20,270
So what?
You're just gonna leave her?

676
00:40:20,286 --> 00:40:22,110
I didn't say that.

677
00:40:22,127 --> 00:40:24,991
I've got some experience with
late night guard duty.

678
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,033
But she doesn't need to know that.

679
00:40:27,047 --> 00:40:30,063
She just needs to know
that she can do it alone.

680
00:41:00,898 --> 00:41:05,111
<i>Life comes rushing at you
from out of the darkness,</i>

681
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:07,611
<i>and when it does,</i>

682
00:41:07,628 --> 00:41:10,531
<i>is there someone in your life
you can count on?</i>

683
00:41:10,547 --> 00:41:12,982
Come on Peyton, you can do this.

684
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:20,242
<i>Someone who'll watch over you
when you stumble and fall,</i>

685
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:27,222
<i>and in that moment...</i>

686
00:41:27,665 --> 00:41:30,600
<i>give you the strength
to face you fears alone.</i>
