1
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,800
Uh, are these
the pages from my book?

2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,700
The "comet,"
not "ravens,"

3
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,000
And i cannot be held
accountable, 'cause baby and me

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Have gone completely
bed-Rest stir crazy.

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,000
What?

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:33,800
Oh.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,300
Great.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:37,000
I've got permanent bed head,
and you're laughg at me.

9
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,100
Look, i'm - I'm sorry.

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,500
I know how hard it is
being cooped up in the house.

11
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,400
"Hard"?

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,300
<i>I haveead this month's issue
of b. Davis magazine</i>

13
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,800
Cover to cover
five times.

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:55,900
Just stay and tell me stories
about life on the outside.

15
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,900
I can't.
I'm working on something.

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,100
Why have you been so weird
lately?

17
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:03,900
You're, like, off in the garage,
and yo-

18
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:06,500
You're making me a present.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,000
Are you making
the baby a present?

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,100
<i>Is it a present for me
and the baby?</i>

21
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,000
All right.

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,400
Uh, y-You know what?
You're right.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,000
Well, yeah, i'm right,
so just stay and let me guess.

24
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,200
No, no. I mean, you're right.
You're going completely crazy.

25
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,900
Crazy people
should not be left alone.

26
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,100
Funny. I thought vampires
didn't photograph.

27
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,200
Oh.

28
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,700
Sam, remind me to buy you
a garlic necklace.

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,700
Good morning, brooke.
Being dramatic, as usual.

30
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,000
I'm not being dramatic.
I'm being a mom.

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,300
And that means keeping sam
out of harm's way.

32
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,600
Ah, so i guess i'm "harm."

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,100
No. You're "harm's" older,
decrepit sister,

34
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,700
"Emotional damage."

35
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,000
Sam: okay.

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,100
We bought you caffeine,
so play nice.

37
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Thank you.

38
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,000
What are you up to?

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,300
Nothing.

40
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,100
I like samantha.
She's plucky and dark.

41
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:13,900
She's going through
a really hard time.

42
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,300
Yeah, i know about jack.
Not just jack.

43
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,600
Sam wants a family.

44
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,400
She is vulnerable, and i don't
want her latching onto you

45
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
Just so that you can end up
disappointing her.

46
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,400
I don't intend
to disappoint her.

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,600
You never do.

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,900
Hi.

49
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,700
Well, hurry along.
We don't tip.

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,100
Do you have to be
such a bitch?

51
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,800
I'm wrong when i'm nice. I'm wrong when
i'm mean. I just can't win with you.

52
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,700
No, you can't,
so please stop trying.

53
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,500
I told you, this relationship
is about business,

54
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,400
And that includes sam.

55
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,000
Haley: knock, knock.

56
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,300
<i>Brought you this month's issue
of b. Davis magazine.</i>

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,700
Our ceiling fan
does 147 rotations a minute.

58
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,100
Well, that answers my question
about how mama's doing.

59
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,900
How's baby?

60
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:22,400
Baby is kicking
baby-Growing ass.

61
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,500
The doctor says
we're doing good.

62
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,000
Good. That's what auntie haley
likes to hear.

63
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,600
Good job in there, kiddo.

64
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,100
So, i got an interesting call
from the label this morning.

65
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,500
Oh, let me guess - They want
mia's album like last week,

66
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
Which, by the way,
is gonna be fantastic,

67
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,300
Which is unbiased,
even though i am the producer.

68
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.
Call wasn't about mia.

69
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,800
They want to buy
one of your songs.

70
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,000
I guess they have an artist
that heard it

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,400
And fell in love with it
and blah, blah, blah.

72
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,300
I never thought about
selling my songs.

73
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,700
Okay, well, from the way
they were raving about you,

74
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,300
You might want
to start thinking about it.

75
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll come off the bench.

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,700
Hey,
i'll do whatever it takes.

77
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,500
I just want
back on the team.

78
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,100
Devon...
coach.

79
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,900
...you know how
this league works.

80
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,600
There is always someone
right behind you

81
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,600
Ready to do
whatever it takes.

82
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,600
The roster's full.

83
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,200
I am sorry.

84
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,700
Hey, scott.

85
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,000
You're here early.

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,200
I'm meeting nino.

87
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,300
We're just gonna run through
some drills before practice.

88
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,700
Good.
Glad to hear that.

89
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,700
You know, you two
have been playing together

90
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,900
Really well
these last weeks.

91
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Thanks.

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,300
And i'm not the only one
who's noticed.

93
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,200
Been getting some calls
about you -

94
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,500
Scouts.

95
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Yeah.

96
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,700
Now,
there's nothing concrete yet,

97
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,900
But as i know more,
you'll know more.

98
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,600
Nice work, nathan.

99
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,800
Thanks.

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,400
What are you shredding?

101
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,000
Nothing.
Junk mail.

102
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
Well,
you have two choices.

103
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,400
You get me the fabric on time,
at cost,

104
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,700
Or your "little start-Up company
that could" - It won't.

105
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,300
What now?

106
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,000
It's the new line.

107
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,200
It's - It's so good.

108
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,300
Fresh.

109
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,500
Some of your best work.

110
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,300
But you've always been
a talented girl, brooke.

111
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,800
Thank you.

112
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,800
Now, would you stop threatening
our suppliers?

113
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
It's tacky.

114
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,500
Well,
nice chip at the wall.

115
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,200
Who says i'm trying
to chip the wall?

116
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,500
My daughter
seems sad lately.

117
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,400
What gave her away -

118
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,800
The "kick me, i'm sad" sign
on h prada?

119
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,100
No, it's her designs.
They're so good.

120
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,500
And she built a fashion empire
on a broken heart,

121
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,800
So who's the boy?

122
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,700
Julian.

123
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,500
Cliffsnotes version -
Boy meets girl,

124
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,300
Girl falls crazy in love,
can't admit it,

125
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,900
Boy moves away,
asks girl to come,

126
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,000
Girl says no.

127
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,400
And girl buries herself
in work.

128
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,600
I've read this book before.

129
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,800
I hear bonding.

130
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,300
Back away from the innocent,
victoria.

131
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,800
So, haley still has
to put her mojo on it,

132
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,500
But whato you think?

133
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,000
I love it.

134
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,500
And i love chase for inspiring
the hell out of you lately.

135
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,900
Well, let's just say good
kissing inspires good music.

136
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,100
Yeah,
he is a good kisser.

137
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,400
I mean, that one tiny,
little, inconsequential,

138
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,400
Hardly memorable time
that i kissed him, you know?

139
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,500
You too?

140
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,800
It was twice.

141
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,200
I mean, honey,

142
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,800
It was only to make lucas
and brooke jealous.

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,600
Great.

144
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,800
I'm still trying to forget
that he kissed brooke.

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,100
B.T.W.,
not going so well.

146
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,800
Honey, why are you so worried
about the kissing part?

147
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,200
I mean, i thought you'd be
more concerned

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,000
With the virginity part.

149
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,700
<i>The what part?</i>

150
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,400
And you didn't know that.

151
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,000
So, uncle skills,
it's been a month,

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
And you still haven't talked
to miss lauren.

153
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,700
Hey, ask her
to the danceonight.

154
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,000
I'm good.

155
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,100
Just trying
to hook a brother up.

156
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,400
Wait, so all you guys got dates
to the dance?

157
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
Andre: not me.

158
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,700
Q always said,
"don't bring sand to the beach."

159
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,700
Is the dance
at the beach?

160
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,500
What about you,
j. Luke?

161
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,000
Hey, guys!

162
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,500
Hey, madison.

163
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
Hey, jamie.

164
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,100
Madison, you're late.

165
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,600
One lap around the park.
Go.

166
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:57,800
I bet jamie's
gonna ask madison.

167
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,500
No, i'm not.

168
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,600
Chuck, andre, no teasing.
One lap around the park. Go.

169
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,500
I thought you were
feeling madison.

170
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,900
Well, i'm not gonna be the only
guy at the dance with a date.

171
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,900
Besides, you said all women
are no good.

172
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,100
No, i said nanny deb
was no good.

173
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,800
Is there anything
you don't remember?

174
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,400
Genius.

175
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,100
Who cares
what people think?

176
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,900
I mean,
you're a leader, right?

177
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,300
So if yowant to ask madison,
i say go for it.

178
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,400
My man.

179
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,600
Lucas: open your eyes.

180
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,800
Told you you had
one last graduation gift.

181
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,500
The cure?

182
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,700
Tonight in atlanta.

183
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,500
But i'm supposed to be leaving
for l.A. Today with brooke.

184
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,100
Yeah, i know,
but brooke and chase

185
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,900
Are having their own...
extended goodbye.

186
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,100
Brooke says you can leave
in the morning.

187
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,300
I mean,
unless you don't want to go.

188
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,500
No, no, no, no, no!
I'm going.

189
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,500
And you are gonna get into
a hell of a lot more

190
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,200
Than a concert
with these tickets.

191
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,400
So,
what do you got for me?

192
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,500
Congratulations, nathan.

193
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,900
You got an offer.

194
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,800
From the nba?

195
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,100
It's from a european team,

196
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,500
???

197
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,700
And it's a two-Year deal.

198
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:35,900
Wait. Europe?

199
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,500
Nathan,
a lot of really good players

200
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,300
Are leaving the nba
to go to europe.

201
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,100
Great.
Give me one of their spots.

202
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,900
Look, i know that this is not
the offer that you were expecting.

203
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,800
But this is still a good offer
from a good team.

204
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,000
Well,
when do they need to know?

205
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,100
They'll move on
another choice tomorrow.

206
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,000
How lame is my life

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,900
That my only friends are a
5- Year-Old and my foster granny?

208
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,400
Language, samantha.

209
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,200
Brooke would totally freak if she
knew i was hanging out with you.

210
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,900
Well,
you're a young lady.

211
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
You need to look like
a young lady.

212
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,200
Language, victoria.

213
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:20,900
And as for brooke,

214
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,700
She'll learn she can't pick
her daughter's friends.

215
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:26,600
That's a lesson i like to call
"the peyton sawyer debacle."

216
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,500
Oh, um,
i can't go in here.

217
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,200
Salesperson
kind of hates me.

218
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,300
Since when?

219
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:36,700
Since the salesperson
caught me shoplifting.

220
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,400
You got caught
shoplifting?

221
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,700
Do you know how much
clothes over bros lost

222
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,800
In profit last year
because of shoplifting?

223
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Millions.

224
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,100
It's why those prices that
you're always complaining about

225
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,600
Are so high.

226
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,700
Okay.

227
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,200
You are a member
of this family now.

228
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:55,300
Theft is common.
We don't do common.

229
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,900
Okay.

230
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,200
I don't do it anymore.

231
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,300
Well,
why did you do it at all?

232
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,100
I don't know.
I guess i got a high from it.

233
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
Well,
find another way to get high.

234
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,100
Okay, your words.

235
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,000
And as for this salesperson,

236
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
If she wants you out,
she'll have to deal with me.

237
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,100
Let's go.

238
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,900
Nice day for carrot sticks,
huh?

239
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,100
Speaking of the dance,
want to go with me?

240
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,100
I'm sorry, jamie.
Chuck just asked me.

241
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,100
Chuck?

242
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
Chuck.

243
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,600
Did you know that chase
lost his virginity to brooke?

244
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,500
Yes.

245
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,600
And i'm guessing
from the look on your face,

246
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,000
You did not know that.

247
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,300
Well,
welcome to tree hill.

248
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,300
I challenge you
to find a boy

249
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,200
That did not lose his virginity
to brooke davis.

250
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,500
But she's brooke davis.

251
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,000
And you're mia catalano.

252
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,500
But she's brooke davis.

253
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,400
And you're mia catalano,
and i'm getting off this train.

254
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,400
I just feel stupid -
Like, everyone knew but me.

255
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,800
All right,
i can relate to you.

256
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,300
Nathan lost his virginity
to my sister.

257
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,900
Wow, you win.

258
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,900
Look, i know the way chase
lookat you.

259
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,100
He probably didn't tell you

260
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,000
Because he's not thinking about
anybody but you.

261
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,500
Now, chop-Chop.
Let's make a record.

262
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,000
I am
a high-School graduate,

263
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,600
And i can't read
a freakin' map.

264
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,000
Look, atlanta's
just a straight shot down 74,

265
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,500
To 95, to 20, to 75,
to 85- 6 hours.

266
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Show-Off.

267
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,000
You too.

268
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,900
And maybe if you
would have studied more

269
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,500
Instea ???

270
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,500
No way.
I got an a-Plus in backseat.

271
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,000
So, you're the only one
with one more graduation gift.

272
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,900
And i was gonna wait
to tell you till i got to l.A.

273
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,900
In case you freaked out,
but...

274
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,300
I sent copies
of "unkindness of ravens"

275
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,400
To a bunch of publishers
in new york.

276
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,100
You thudded me.

277
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,400
Payback.

278
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,900
And right now, there's
some stuffy old publisher

279
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,100
Reading your words
and falling in love with them.

280
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
And he's gonna buy them,

281
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,600
And he's gonna fly you
to new york

282
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,500
And make you very,
very famous.

283
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,100
Thank you
for doing that.

284
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,700
I mean, i wanted to,
but i just...

285
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,200
You were afraid.

286
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Yeah.

287
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
I know.

288
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,800
But someone once told me
your art matters,

289
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,500
And i wonder who that was.

290
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,700
I don't know

291
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,800
Off that easy with just a thank-You,
either. And you're not gonna get

292
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I mean, when they turn your
brilliant novel into a movie,

293
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,000
You are gonna have to cast,

294
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Like, a hot, rockin' body,
kick-Ass p. Sawyer.

295
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,100
Yeah,
only if i can play lucas.

296
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:09,600
Oh!

297
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,200
So, this julian -
Where is he?

298
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,400
Los angeles, and i really think
she wanted to go.

299
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,000
I know i did.

300
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,400
It was the closest
i've ever come to a real family.

301
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,500
I'm sorry
she didn't think of you.

302
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,900
My daughter
can be quite selfish.

303
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,000
Hey, no bagging on brooke.
I told you.

304
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
It's my "friendship
with the devil" deal-Breaker.

305
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,100
Really?

306
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,300
<i>You're following us?</i>

307
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,600
I know everything about retail
and who you should be watching,

308
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,000
And it is not us.

309
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,500
It's actually
that girl over there

310
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
About to sff that clutch
into her knockoff.

311
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,500
As for samantha...

312
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,300
Sorry about
the shoplifting thing.

313
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,400
It...won't happen again.

314
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,600
Satisfied?

315
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,700
Now you can go back

316
00:15:56,700 --> 00:16:01,100
To being completely and utterly
incompetent at your job.

317
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,700
Why are you such a bitch?

318
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,300
This bitch
just defended you.

319
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,100
A thank-You would be nice.

320
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,600
Thank you.
Now, why are you such a bitch?

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,400
Maybe i get a high
from it.

322
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:15,000
You know what?
I stopped shoplifting.

323
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,400
Maybe you could stop
being so mean.

324
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,000
Brooke:
i said no bonding.

325
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,400
I told victoria to keep her
old-Lady talons away from sam,

326
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,300
And then there they were,

327
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,600
Having a freakin'
tree hill shopping-Palooza.

328
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,000
Look at her face.
She's so smug.

329
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,200
I just want to throw
that magazine across the room.

330
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:44,300
Okay, um, maybe it is because
i'm hormonal,

331
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,100
Or maybe it's because i've been locked in this room
for so long,

332
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,400
I have completely lost touch
with reality,

333
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,600
But is it the worst thing
in the world

334
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,500
For momzilla
to be nice to sam?

335
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,300
Yes

336
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,500
Okay, what if she hated her?

337
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Wouldn't that be worse?

338
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,900
Yes, but...

339
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,500
...she never
took me shopping.

340
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Am i interrupting?

341
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,100
No, just looking at who i can
pull up to take your place.

342
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,200
Devon.

343
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,500
Did you come here
to talk to me about devon

344
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Or the european offer?

345
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,200
Both, actually.

346
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,100
But first,
i need to ask you a question.

347
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,500
Okay.

348
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,000
Do you think i'm good enough
to make it to the nba?

349
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,900
Are you good enough?

350
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,200
Yes, nathan,
you're good enough.

351
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,400
But it takes more
than talent.

352
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,500
It takes
timing and luck.

353
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,400
Look, you have an offer
on the table,

354
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,200
And a two-Year contract
to play professional ball

355
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,100
Does not come often.

356
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
So you think
i should take it.

357
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,100
Yes, i do.

358
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,000
Yeah, no,
that's really great.

359
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,400
I think that adjustment
helps a lo

360
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,200
Cool.

361
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,000
Sounded good to me.

362
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,800
Sorry to interrupt.

363
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,800
The recording light wasn't on,
so i thought i'd just come in.

364
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,700
You're nick lachey.

365
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,000
And you're mia catalano.

366
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,600
See? I told you.

367
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,300
So, what's a guy got to do
to get your song on his album?

368
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,500
Um, wow.

369
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,200
When the label said
they had an artist

370
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,400
Who was interested in recording
one of my songs, i really -

371
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,500
Didn't picture me.

372
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,700
Yeah, at all.

373
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,400
Nick lachey.

374
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
You really love using first
and last names.

375
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,200
It's a tree hill thing.
Sorry, nick lachey.

376
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,200
Okay, just go.

377
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,300
Bye.

378
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,000
So,
what are the magic words?

379
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
'Cause i really want you
to say yes.

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,800
Your song is great,
and trust me -

381
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,500
I've listened to a lot
of new songs for this album.

382
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,600
Yeah, i'm - I'm sorry.

383
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,500
It's just that
"all in my head"

384
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,700
Wasn't supposed to be
one of them.

385
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,400
Just screwed up.

386
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,100
I'm glad they did.

387
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,200
I really am flattered that
you came all the way out here,

388
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,800
But there are no
magic words.

389
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,500
The answer is just no.

390
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,500
What if i told you
i had a really rough flight?

391
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,800
Standby.

392
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,400
Middle seat.

393
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,700
Coach.

394
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,700
I'm sorry.

395
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,700
I'm just not interested
in selling my music.

396
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
Oh, but would you sign this
for my son?

397
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,000
He's a big fan.
His name's jamie.

398
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,000
Peyton: can you believe
that nathan and haley

399
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Are married with a baby?

400
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,000
Yeah.

401
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,000
I think they were ready
to get married and have a baby

402
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,500
On their second date.

403
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,600
I think they did.

404
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:03,800
I really hate that i'm gonna
miss jamie getting bigger.

405
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,300
I mean, by the time
i come home to visit,

406
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,800
He's already gonna be
walking and talking.

407
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,800
Nah,
with nathan and haley,

408
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,200
He'll be reading
and dribbling first.

409
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,600
They are gonna be
amazing parents.

410
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,800
And you are gonna be
an amazing mom.

411
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,200
You should have that
one day.

412
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,900
And you will.

413
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,600
What's chuck got
that i don't?

414
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:31,800
Better timing,
a date with madison.

415
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,300
I don't get it.

416
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,400
I thought me and madison
had an unspoken connection.

417
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,300
Look, nothing is unspoken
with women.

418
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,000
Now, you can't let this thing
with madison

419
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,400
Ruin the dance tonight.

420
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,400
It's not,
'cause i'm not going.

421
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,000
Jamie, you got to go
to your first dance, man.

422
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,800
I mean,
what happens at your first dance

423
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,900
Becomes the building block
of the rep

424
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,000
That'll follow you
all the way through school.

425
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,100
Me?
My first dance?

426
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,900
I walked in "antwon,"
but i left "skills."

427
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:09,300
So, what? You st gonna sit
onhis couch?

428
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,000
You sit around
poing about nanny deb.

429
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,500
I'm gonna sit around
and pout about madison.

430
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,200
Cool.
You want to roll like i roll?

431
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,300
Then i'm going to the dance...
now.

432
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,800
Oh, man.
This is killing me.

433
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,500
At least the punch
is good.

434
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,900
My wife
just had a little girl.

435
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,800
I told myself i'd be called up
by the time she got here.

436
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,900
I'm sorry about what happened,
man.

437
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,700
It ain't your fault.

438
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,200
And i wanted
to tell you that.

439
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,900
All me.

440
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,600
So,
what are you gonna do now?

441
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,600
Work harder.

442
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,000
Try and get picked up
and...

443
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,000
If i do...

444
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
...i'm gonna do things
differently.

445
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,700
Funny thing is, um...

446
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,100
I told you ???

447
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,300
But i should have been
telling myself that.

448
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,300
'Cause you only get one.

449
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,600
Sam?

450
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,000
Well, the broom's
not parked outside,

451
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,700
So i guess victoria's not here,
either.

452
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,400
Maybe i'll do some filing.

453
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:09,900
Oh...my...god.

454
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,000
Thank you.

455
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,000
What?

456
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,200
It amazes me
how much you can eat.

457
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,300
It's kind of like
you're eating for two.

458
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,500
Are you eating for two?

459
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,000
Trust me, this will be
just the tip of the iceberg

460
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,500
When i'm pregnant.

461
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,200
And either way,
you said it was our last hurrah,

462
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,700
So how can that
not include

463
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,300
Stopping for
"world's best pie"?

464
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,000
Which, by the way, how do you
think they determine that?

465
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,900
Well,
i'm - I'm sure they do studies.

466
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,300
Damn good last-Hurrah pie.

467
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,000
The way i see it is,

468
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,100
As soon as that car pulls out
for l.A. Tomorrow,

469
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,800
I'm officially an adult,

470
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,700
Which means
no more being spontaneous,

471
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,400
No more shoveling pie.

472
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,600
Well, if this really is our last
hurrah, how about we, uh...

473
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,900
Go out in style?

474
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,100
We can't.

475
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:13,400
Are you serious?

476
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,100
Oh, yeah.
Dine and dash.

477
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,100
I dare you.

478
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
I will see you
on the outside.

479
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,800
There's an extra $5
in it

480
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,400
If you run out behind me
screaming.

481
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,800
Woman: no, no, no!

482
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,600
I can't believe
we just did that!

483
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,600
No, no!
What are you doing?!

484
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,600
Dances suck, huh?

485
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,700
Want to get out of here
and get some ice cream?

486
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
Sorry, bro.

487
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,300
I met someone.

488
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,000
Antwon:
aw, come on, now.

489
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,500
There's a lot of girls out there
you could be having fun with.

490
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,300
Why do i have to try?

491
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,800
You're not.

492
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,800
It's not the same thing.

493
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,100
I know you like her.

494
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,800
I think you're chicken.

495
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
I am not.

496
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,500
Look, i'm not scared.

497
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,500
Prove it.

498
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:49,400
Hey, you're home.

499
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,400
You missed jamie on his way
to the dance.

500
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,900
He was so cute
in his little suit!

501
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,000
Looked like
a little lucas.

502
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,000
What's going on?

503
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,300
I got an offer to play...
in europe.

504
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:06,400
And i don't know, hales,
maybe we should...consider it.

505
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,600
It's good money.
It's a two-Year contract.

506
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,300
But you want to play
in the nba.

507
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,300
I know, but so does
every other person on my team

508
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:16,100
And every other player
in the "b" league.

509
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,500
Okay, um...

510
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:24,000
All right, let's say that
you take this two-Year contract

511
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,300
And then the nba
comes calling.

512
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,800
What if i don't take it
and then they never call?

513
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,300
I mean, i've been working
on this...

514
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,500
Comeback
for a long time now,

515
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,500
<i>And maybe
this is my chance</i>

516
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,600
And i'm just too focused on the
fantasy of the nba to notice.

517
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,000
It's not a fantasy.
That's your dream.

518
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,500
There's nothing wrong
with pursuing it.

519
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,900
To what end?

520
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,900
I don't know.

521
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
But whatever you decide,

522
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,100
You have a wife and a son
who love you,

523
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,800
And we're behind you 100%.

524
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,400
Thanks.

525
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,000
Yeah.

526
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,700
What do you call this
again?

527
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,700
The chaser.

528
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,200
Really?

529
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,900
'Cause it tastes just like
a bad long island iced tea.

530
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,800
Why didn't you tell me you lost
your virginity to broo davis?

531
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,300
I didn't.

532
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
Why,
did she say i was a virgin?

533
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,100
Nice.

534
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,000
Peyton told me,
but it should have been you.

535
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,100
The losing-Virginity topic

536
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,200
Really isn't something a guy
likes to bring up to his girl.

537
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,400
Or himself.

538
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,600
But, then again, your premiere
starred brooke davis.

539
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,800
Stay out of it,
nick lachey.

540
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,500
So, what's brooke been up to,
anyway?

541
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,700
You have really out-Bitched
yourself this time, victoria.

542
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,600
Explain.

543
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,700
Or no.
Don't explain.

544
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,100
I'm sure it'll just be
more of the same

545
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:17,000
Self-Serving,
manipulative b.S.

546
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,300
Oh, just stop the histrionics.
We could lose samantha.

547
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,800
"We"?
She is not yours to lose.

548
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Samantha and i
have gotten very close,

549
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,300
And that woman gave her up.

550
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,100
She made her mistakes
a long time ago,

551
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,500
And it's a little late
to try to show up now.

552
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:31,800
I'm sorry.

553
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,100
Are you kidding,
or am i being punked?

554
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,500
This is different.
I never abandoned you.

555
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,200
Not physically.

556
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
And maybe that's worse.

557
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,000
You think i'm so bad.

558
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,300
I destroyed those letters
for you, brooke.

559
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,100
I see how much samantha
means to you.

560
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,200
No.
Don't do that.

561
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,400
You have never done
anything for me.

562
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
This is about you
trying to have

563
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,200
Some half-Assed do-Over
with sam

564
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,300
Because you screwed up
so completely with me,

565
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,600
And it is so obvious
and so damn pathetic!

566
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,400
Just stop!

567
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,700
And you never
took me shopping.

568
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,500
Okay, wait.
Just hear me out.

569
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,600
You're just in time.

570
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,400
For what?

571
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,600
I have
the instrumental track

572
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,100
For "all in my head"
cued up.

573
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,300
Go sing.

574
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:24,900
Now?

575
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:28,100
Hey, joe perry said,
"let the music do the talking."

576
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,000
An aerosmith reference.
I knew i liked you.

577
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,400
I turned down the offer.

578
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,800
Yeah, i know.

579
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,100
I just got off the phone
with the scout.

580
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,500
Nathan, i -

581
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,200
I'm going to the nba,
bobby.

582
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,800
I was going to say

583
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:23,900
That the european league
missed out on a great player.

584
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
I hope the nba doesn't.

585
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:28,300
Thank you.

586
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,100
Oh, and i want you to know
i told the scout about devon.

587
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,300
He's a good player.

588
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
He just made a mistake,

589
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,600
And that doesn't mean he
shouldn't get a second chance.

590
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,100
I told the scout
the same thing.

591
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,500
I'll see you in practice
tomorrow, scott.

592
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,300
I'll see you at practice.

593
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:56,300
Antwon "skills" taylor
crashing a 5-Year-Olds' dance?

594
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,200
I was hoping to see you.

595
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,800
I wanted to ask you out, but i
was kind of hesitant because...

596
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,100
I just got out
of a relationship.

597
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,500
Me too.

598
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,000
Bad break-Up.

599
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,600
It broke my heart.

600
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,600
So i guess
neither one of us

601
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,300
Should really be dating
right now, huh?

602
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,800
Probably not.

603
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,800
So, you want to dance?

604
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,900
No.

605
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,900
But i could go
for some rebound s-E-X.

606
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm kidding.

607
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,600
A dance would be nice.

608
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,300
It was good.

609
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,500
It was great -
The song, i mean.

610
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,100
I know.

611
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,800
Okay,
i'll let you record it.

612
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,300
One condition -

613
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,300
I want to produce.

614
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,900
Hey.

615
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,300
Sorry i've been sneaking around
with your mom.

616
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,600
It's just...
she's not that bad

617
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,500
Once you get past
the royal bitch of it all.

618
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,700
No, she's worse.

619
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,900
You know, she'd really like
another chance.

620
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,500
Sam...

621
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:44,300
I have a letter for you...

622
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,300
...from your birth mother.

623
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,500
I guess she's been sending them
to the store,

624
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,700
Hoping that i could help her
get in touch with you,

625
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,700
And somehow they ended up
in junk mail.

626
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,200
Yeah, i don't want it.

627
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Sam.

628
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,800
No, she gave me up.
She doesn't want me, right?

629
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
What does she want now?
To say she's sorry?

630
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200
Maybe.

631
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,200
Well, then,
she should have said it.

632
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,000
Every time i sat there
in that coffee shop

633
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,700
Right in front of her...

634
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,300
She didn't even know
that was her own daughter.

635
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,400
So, screw her
and her "i'm sorrys"

636
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,000
Because all that ever got me
was a sucky life.

637
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,200
And there's nothing
she could say to fix that.

638
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,200
Samantha, you've been going
to that coffee shop for months.

639
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,500
You must want something
from her,

640
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,500
E- Even if
it's just closure.

641
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,800
Yeah. Okay.

642
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:50,300
How about why?

643
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,800
Why wasn't i good enough?

644
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,700
Why didn't she love me
enough?

645
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,900
Why could she just
throw me away?

646
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,200
Maybe...

647
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,500
Maybe she wants
to tell you

648
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,100
Why giving you up
was the hardest thing

649
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,000
That she ever had to do.

650
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:22,100
Sweetheart,
i have no idea how you feel.

651
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:26,400
Even on her worst day,
victoria never gave me away,

652
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,100
But if you
want to know why,

653
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,900
She's the only person
who can answer that for you.

654
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,000
I should have told you
about brooke.

655
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,700
Did you love her?

656
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:16,200
Thought i did.

657
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:21,600
That's before
i fell in love with you.

658
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,500
???

659
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,600
Really?

660
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,100
I'm sorry i hosed you,
man.

661
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,300
She's waiting for you
over there.

662
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,300
No.

663
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,800
Hello?

664
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,200
This is he.

665
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,600
Yes, sir.

666
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,100
A tryout.

667
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,200
Yes, sir.

668
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
All right, thank you.

669
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,800
Babe...a tryout!

670
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,400
Oh, god.

671
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:50,000
What if i just gave away
my last chance?

672
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,100
Your chance is coming,
baby.

673
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,800
I really believe that.

674
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,700
I'm gonna be right here.

675
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,100
It's okay.

676
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,000
Peyton.

677
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,300
Hi!

678
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
Close your eyes.

679
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:11,900
I knew you had a surprise
for me.

680
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,100
Open your eyes.

681
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:20,700
Where did you find this?

682
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:24,600
It's the best concert
we never went to.

683
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,200
I still can't believe

684
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,200
You pretended to like the cure
all those years.

685
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:30,700
I never said
i loved the cure.

686
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,900
I said i loved kissing you
to the cure.

687
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,200
This was one of the best days
of my life.

688
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,300
Really good pie.

689
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,400
We had our whole lives
in front of us.

690
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,200
Hey.

691
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,400
We still do.

692
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,600
I know.

693
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,800
Well,
the cure is playing.

694
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,500
Where's my kissing?

695
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,800
I can't believe i kept
those tickets for six months...

696
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,700
...and i lost them
in six hours.

697
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,600
You know what?

698
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,200
Maybe we can just go back
to the doorman

699
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:31,200
And explain
that we really did have two.

700
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,800
Yeah, yeah.

701
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,400
I'm kind of thinking he's
probably heard that one before.

702
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,000
I'm sorry
about the concert.

703
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,500
Who goes
to a sold-Out show anyway?

704
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,400
And besides, i only have
one last night with you.

705
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,300
Unless you show up tomorrow
with, like, another surprise.

706
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,500
If that's what it takes
to keep you from leaving.

707
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,000
I'm gonna miss you.

708
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,600
You better...

709
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,600
'Cause i have a lot of dreams
wrapped up in you.

710
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,200
And it's kind of hard
to have a happily ever after

711
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,000
All by yourself.

712
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,500
And we're gonna have that,
lucas.

713
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:13,200
We are gonna get married,

714
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,700
And we're gonna make
a lot of babies

715
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:17,800
In the backseat
of this car.

716
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,700
I promise.

717
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,800
And i always keep
my promises.

718
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,900
Good...

719
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,800
'Cause i'm gonna
hold you to it.

720
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:47,700
