previously
on "one tree hill"...

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,500
were you robbed?
last night.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,400
you can't tell anyone, okay?
deb, you own a gun, right?

4
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,900
i want you to teach me
how to use it.

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,200
shoplift much?
i don't know what you're talking about.

6
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:13,900
what are you doing?!
get off me, bitch!

7
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:18,700
i am going to do the world
a favor and kill you,

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,700
but first,
i'm gonna get jamie back.

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,300
and you're gonna help me.

10
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,400
where do you think you're going?
aah!

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,000
apparently, my mom's dating
some freak she met online.

12
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,400
i'm gonna find out
who this jerk is.

13
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,100
and when i do,
it's gonna get ugly.

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,000
i used to put all
my little treasures in here.

15
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,500
now you can, too.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,100
can you help me make a
cape? quentin really likes mine.

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,300
i thought maybe we could
make one for him, too.

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,200
have a nice night.

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,300
oh, my god.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,800
lucas, what is it?

21
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:58,300
quentin fields
was shot tonight.

22
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,000
he's dead.

26
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,900
quentin fields
was a basketball player.

27
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,500
he was also a son, a brother,
somebody's teammate,

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
somebody's friend.

29
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,400
i didn't know quentin fields.

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
i guess now i never will.

31
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,600
hey, did anybody call you?

32
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,200
yeah.

33
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,000
is it true?

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,300
is quentin really --

35
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,000
is he dead?

36
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,000
yeah.

37
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,400
come on in.

38
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,700
did you ever wonder

39
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,600
what it would be like
if you weren't you anymore?

40
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
if you were suddenly gone,
how would your world react?

41
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,200
q, where the hell
are you, man?

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,800
please tell me i didn't drag
myself out of bed for nothing.

43
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,900
call me back.

44
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,700
whatever you imagined is wrong.

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
hey, what are you
doing here?

46
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,300
haley, what happened?

47
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,100
there's nothing romantic
about death.

48
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,300
grief is like the ocean.

49
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,800
it's deep and dark
and bigger than all of us.

50
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,000
and pain is like
a thief in the night.

51
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,600
what am i gonna tell
my students?

52
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,400
what am i gonna tell
jamie?

53
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,700
he loves quentin.
he's...making him a cape.

54
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,000
i'll do it.

55
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,900
no.

56
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,100
we should do it
together.

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,400
hey, coach luke's back.
what's happening, coach?

58
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,000
hey, guys, uh...

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,300
...we have to tell you
something.

60
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
what's wrong, mama?

61
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,000
it's about quentin, son.

62
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,400
listen...

63
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,400
quentin had an accident,
jamie.

64
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,400
what kind of accident?

65
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,200
is he gonna be okay?

66
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,000
no, he's not okay.

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,100
his -- his body
stopped working,

68
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,400
and he's gone now.

69
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,900
he's gone to heaven,
okay?

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,100
and we're not gonna be able
to see him anymore.

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,200
what about the ravens?
isn't he gonna play anymore?

72
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,400
jamie...he died, honey.

73
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,600
he can't play anymore.

74
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,300
and mommy and daddy
are incredibly sad about it.

75
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,300
so it's okay
if you're sad, too.

76
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,200
i know
that he loved you very much,

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,000
and i know
that you're gonna miss him.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,300
and we're really
gonna miss him, too.

79
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,800
but what about his cape?

80
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,500
jamie, he's...

81
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,500
jamie, honey,
listen to me.

82
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
he's gonna like it.
you'll see.

83
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,200
no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
hey, guys, i'm sorry.

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,300
there's been
a misunderstanding, okay?

85
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,100
these -- these clothes
are not free!

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,300
just taking inventory.

87
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:38,500
brooke davis,
have you lost your mind?!

88
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,300
it's my store.
they're my clothes.

89
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,900
i can do
what i want with them.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,100
but what are you doing?

91
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,500
we're having a sale.

92
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,900
for one day, and one day only,
everything in the store

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,400
is freakin' free!

94
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,600
hey! no!

95
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,500
do you
want to talk about it?

96
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,700
haley told me
about your mom.

97
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:57,100
no, as a matter of fact,
i don't want to talk about it.

98
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,000
there's nothing left to say,
peyton.

99
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,300
my mom's a bitch!
she's a horrible, selfish bitch!

100
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,600
happy now?
was that a good talk?

101
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,300
why are you yelling at me?

102
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,800
i'm gonna need
my key back, too.

103
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,600
what?

104
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,500
my house key?
you moved out, right?

105
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,600
i can't have people
coming and going

106
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,700
like it's some kind
of rachel gatina crack den.

107
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,800
okay, brooke, i understand
that you're upset,

108
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,100
but is there something else
that's going on?

109
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,300
i just need to feel safe
in my house, that's all.

110
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,100
so i need your key.

111
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,700
fine.

112
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,000
what do you want, peyton?

113
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,200
what is it
that you are doing here?

114
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,900
i came here to tell you

115
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
that one of lucas'
basketball players

116
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,800
was killed last night.

117
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,700
quentin fields.

118
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
and luke's a mess.

119
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,138
i just thought
you'd want to know.

120
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,900
i don't know
what to say to any of you.

121
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,400
i didn't know what to say
to my 5-year-old son

122
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,900
who loved quentin
just as much as many of you do.

123
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,600
so, um, if you want to talk
about how you're feeling --

124
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,600
what's the point?

125
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,100
i mean, he's gone, right?

126
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,900
some idiot just shot him,
and now he's gone forever.

127
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,500
so what's the point?

128
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,100
there is no point.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
you think
you can fool me, huh?

130
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,400
you think you can spoil my plan
to get jamie back

131
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,200
with your
stupid defective heart?

132
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,900
well, you can't.

133
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,600
i have a new plan.

134
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,300
i'm not gonna have to take
jamie after all.

135
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,900
he's gonna come
right to me.

136
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,200
and why
would he do that?

137
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,700
oh, because poor grandpa dan
is dying,

138
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,900
and his last dying wish

139
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,400
is to say goodbye
to his sweet little grandson.

140
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,600
and then what?

141
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,500
in a few months,
i'll be dead,

142
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,600
and when
they can't find jamie,

143
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,600
they'll start looking
for you.

144
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,900
and then you'll be the fugitive
that you don't want to be.

145
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,300
mm...

146
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,000
i've decided
i can live with that.

147
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,000
by then, i'll have a six-month
head start with my son.

148
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,900
when life gives you lemons,
you can't be a sourpuss.

149
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,400
it won't work.

150
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,600
they won't bring jamie
to see me.

151
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,300
in case you've forgotten,
i'm a murderer, remember?

152
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:57,500
besides, my grandson's
afraid of me.

153
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,700
not according to this.

154
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,900
found this
in your jacket.

155
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,300
looks like jamie loved you
almost as much as he loves me.

156
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,100
what's he gonna do?

157
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,900
drive himself out here?

158
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,900
what are you gonna do
about the person who brings him?

159
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,500
well, i sincerely hope
it's haley,

160
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,500
but i'm not gonna do
anything.

161
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,500
dan scott, however,
is going to kill that person.

162
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,200
at least that's what
it'll look like.

163
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,500
i mean,
in case you've forgotten,

164
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,600
you're a murderer,
remember?

165
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,400
i was gonna tell him
i was proud of him.

166
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,300
you know, last night
when you came by the office --

167
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:49,200
i said, "i'll just talk
to q tomorrow."

168
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,700
i was gonna tell him
how far he's come

169
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,400
and how proud i was of him
for that.

170
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:01,500
you're supposed to get tomorrow,
you know?

171
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,900
that kid
was just 17 years old.

172
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,700
his life
hadn't even started yet.

173
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,000
and the phone rings
in the middle of the night,

174
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,500
and he's just...gone.

175
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,100
it's just wrong, luke.

176
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,100
it's impossible
and just wrong.

177
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,700
i feel
like i let him down.

178
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,300
i asked him to be
a good example

179
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
and a good teammate.

180
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,200
and then i go
and get suspended?

181
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,400
yeah, but you was defending him,
though.

182
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,700
i was failing him.

183
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,900
he's got a little brother.

184
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
he's got parents.

185
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,500
how does a mother
ever breathe again?

186
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,900
can i have this?

187
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,400
i think he'd like that.

188
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,900
i like
your beach house, by the way.

189
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,900
amazing view.

190
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,200
yes, i've been there.

191
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,500
where do you think
i got your gun from?

192
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:24,100
bedside table, under
the suburban-filth catalog.

193
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,700
their bras are sexy, huh?

194
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,700
why don't you have kids?

195
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:37,000
you're young,
attractive,

196
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,500
crazy as a craphouse rat,
but still...

197
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,100
you could have
a little boy of your own.

198
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,200
hell, i might even
be able to help you out.

199
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,900
i am really going to enjoy
killing you.

200
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,700
stay in the yard, okay?

201
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,300
hi.

202
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,600
they gave me a present.

203
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,500
what are you playing?

204
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,300
basketball.

205
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,400
what's your name?

206
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,800
james lucas scott.
what's yours?

207
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,300
well,
everyone calls me dre,

208
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,900
but my real name
is brandon andre fields.

209
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,400
quentin was my brother.

210
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,000
quentin was my friend.

211
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,600
i'm making him a cape.

212
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,400
coach scott...

213
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:20,500
i'm quentin's mother --
denice.

214
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,800
i wanted to thank you
for standing up for my boy

215
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:27,300
the way you did
in that last game.

216
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
it's a shame that we
have to meet like this.

217
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,200
yes, ma'am, it is.

218
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,900
coach taylor...

219
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,600
quentin always had so many
nice things to say about you,

220
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,900
and you, too, nathan.

221
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:45,000
i really appreciate
you boys coming here,

222
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:49,700
but i mostly wanted to say
thank you to this one.

223
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,700
my son has always loved
basketball.

224
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,500
but i got to tell you --

225
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,900
when i came home
and found him reading a book,

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,500
it just about gave me
a heart attack. 

227
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,100
he said, "mama,

228
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,800
mrs. james scott,
she don't play."

229
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,000
he said, "she almost as bad
as you are."

230
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,300
i realize that you were
all trying to help my boy

231
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,800
live up to the greatness
that god gave him,

232
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:16,200
and you should be
proud of that.

233
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,300
your strength
is inspiring.

234
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,500
my strength
is from jesus christ.

235
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,100
i am gonna miss my baby boy
for the rest of this life.

236
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:45,800
but i know
we are gonna see him again,

237
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:49,600
and our faith
will see us through.

238
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,900
i'm gonna be a musician
when i grow up.

239
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,900
i'm gonna play basketball.

240
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,300
yeah, i might
do that, too.

241
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:05,300
my mom makes the best spaghetti
in the world.

242
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:08,700
my mom makes
good macaroni and cheese.

243
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,900
my grandpa
can whistle really loud.

244
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,500
my grandma deb
wears really tight pants.

245
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,700
my favorite animal
is a cheetah.

246
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,500
mine's a rabbit...
or a tiger...

247
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,300
or a raven.

248
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,400
yeah, a raven.

249
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,000
i'm not going in there.
it's too sad.

250
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,200
what color is the cape?

251
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:35,800
red.

252
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
cool.

253
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,300
jamie, come on, buddy,
time to go.

254
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:44,388
bye.

255
00:16:44,454 --> 00:16:46,388
bye.

256
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,900
i'll be right back.

257
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,100
you're a good boy,
you know that?

258
00:17:30,976 --> 00:17:32,342
hey.

259
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:33,743
hey.

260
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,600
everyone's just kind of
hanging out downstairs.

261
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,700
i just thought maybe
jamie wanted to finish this.

262
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,800
i was also thinking

263
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,700
that maybe he shouldn't
go to the funeral.

264
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:55,500
it's just gonna be so sad
and final.

265
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
well, that's
what death is, hales.

266
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
i know,
but he's 5 years old,

267
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,300
and he still sees
a better world than we do.

268
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,400
well, not to mention wakes and
funerals really creep me out.

269
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,200
yeah, for you,
it's clowns.

270
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,000
for me,
it's old dead guys.

271
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:19,400
you know, my, uh...
my mom's grandfather died

272
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,600
when i was
around jamie's age.

273
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,900
and so my whole family's
at the wake,

274
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,300
and we're kneeling
in front of the casket.

275
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,300
and i'm really scared because
there's this old dead guy

276
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,100
just a few feet
away from me.

277
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,000
anyway, my mom's crying,

278
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:37,900
and, uh, my dad --
he says a couple of words,

279
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
and then he leans forward,
and he kisses the corpse.

280
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,100
and now
i'm totally freaked out.

281
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,900
and then, he turns to me,
and he says,

282
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
"kiss your
great grandfather, son."

283
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,800
he didn't make you?

284
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,800
yeah.

285
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,100
it's my dad.

286
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:58,500
"kiss the 100-year-old dead guy
in makeup."

287
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
sorry. dan sucks.

288
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,400
yeah.

289
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,600
maybe you're right.

290
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,500
maybe jamie should
sit this one out.

291
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,300
i'm so sorry.

292
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,500
i wanted to see you
as soon as i found out.

293
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,300
it's okay.
thank you, though.

294
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,700
you must be devastated.

295
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,200
i just feel numb,

296
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,100
like i'm in a bad dream,
and i just want to wake up.

297
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
i just want q to wake up.

298
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,600
did they --

299
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,900
have they found
the person responsible?

300
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,900
i don't think so.

301
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,400
look, i probably should be
getting back downstairs.

302
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,300
i don't want to make
the day worse

303
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,000
for you, nate,
or somebody else.

304
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,700
okay.

305
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,000
antwon...

306
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,100
i'm here for you.

307
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,900
yeah, you here.

308
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,800
q gone.

309
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,100
and...
i'm someplace else.

310
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,000
it's just so hard to accept
that things like this happen,

311
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:35,600
and not just to quentin,
but at all -- ever.

312
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,600
one out of every 500 people
gets assaulted or raped.

313
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
there were
30,000 aggravated assaults

314
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,100
in our state alone
last year,

315
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:47,600
7,000 robberies,
3,000 murders, 600 rapes.

316
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,600
it's official.
like sucks, and then you die.

317
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,800
i'm sorry.

318
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,400
it's a tragedy.
i know it is. i'm sorry.

319
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,100
excuse me.

320
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,700
hey.

321
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,300
i'm so sorry about that.
do i need to go talk to jamie?

322
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,100
no, he'll be fine.

323
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,000
you can talk to me,
though.

324
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,600
i'm just going through a lot.

325
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,000
saying goodbye to angie,

326
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,100
and victoria
trying to take the company.

327
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,500
and then i...
fall down the stairs.

328
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,500
and now this.

329
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,600
it's just a lot.

330
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,300
there was a therapist
that nathan and i went to

331
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,700
when we were having
some problems.

332
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,100
she really helped.

333
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,000
i can give you her number
if you want.

334
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,100
okay.

335
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
okay. good.

336
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:06,300
i'm really sorry
about everything.

337
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
must have been some fall
down the stairs. does it hurt?

338
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:16,600
get your filthy, murdering hands
away from my son!

339
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,900
i don't know what to say
to them.

340
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,300
i'm 22 years old,

341
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,300
and i'm supposed to make sense
out of all this

342
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,300
for my students?

343
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,800
i c-- i can't.

344
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,100
you reached quentin.

345
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,100
you'll reach them, too.

346
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,700
what's your name?

347
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,000
sam -- samantha walker.
i'm new.

348
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:20,000
can you just take that desk
in the back, please?

349
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,100
why? what's wrong
with this one?

350
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,300
that desk is taken.

351
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,300
quentin, uh...

352
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,900
was a great kid.

353
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,800
he was the leader
of this team,

354
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:52,800
and i know
that he was your friend.

355
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,600
i wish...

356
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:58,500
i could take this pain away,

357
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
but i can't.

358
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,400
and i'm sorry.

359
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,200
it's okay to feel angry.

360
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,200
it's okay to feel pain.

361
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,900
it's even okay to hate
the person that did this,

362
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,800
but when that anger and --
and that pain and that hate

363
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:18,000
becomes too much for you,
you come see me, nate, or luke.

364
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,900
understand?

365
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,500
we are your family, and we
gonna get through this together.

366
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,400
you guys know that
q was working out with me,

367
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,100
helping me with my game.

368
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,900
and that's how
i'm gonna remember him --

369
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,700
strong, happy,
playing the game he loved.

370
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,400
i want you all to find
your own best memories of q

371
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,900
and hold onto them

372
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,200
'cause that's
where he still lives,

373
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,400
and he always will.

374
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,300
peyton?

375
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,900
hey.

376
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,600
hi.
still moving in?

377
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,200
yeah.

378
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,500
i'm -- 

379
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,100
i'm just trying
to keep busy

380
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,500
and stay preoccupied.

381
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,700
i brought you something.

382
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,700
brooke, it's fine.

383
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,500
no, i'm really sorry.

384
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,200
it was a total "f-you" transfer
from victoria to you,

385
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,600
and you didn't deserve it.

386
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,500
it's fine.

387
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,900
is that why you threw all your
pretty clothes out in the street?

388
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,500
kind of.

389
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:26,000
victoria wants the line
that bad, she can have it,

390
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,100
you know?

391
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,000
life's too short.

392
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,200
hey, i got something
for you, too.

393
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,600
so, i had to wrestle
two really strong women

394
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,300
and a kid in a wheelchair
for the couture stuff,

395
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,300
but most of it's there.

396
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,500
you can keep them.

397
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,300
life's too short, brooke,

398
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,500
to fight,
to be miserable...

399
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,200
to let the bitter ones
change how awesome you are.

400
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,400
you know what? um...

401
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
you guys asked me
what the point was

402
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,900
to all of this school
and literature -- life.

403
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,400
and, uh,
i said there was no a point.

404
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,400
and that's not true.

405
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,400
what i should have said was,
"i don't know,"

406
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
because the truth is,
not long ago,

407
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,000
i sat right where you are

408
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:40,400
and wondered
exactly the same things.

409
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:45,000
when something that's tragic and
evil and unexplainable happens

410
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,100
like losing someone forever...

411
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:52,600
...i still wonder...

412
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:55,100
just like you do.

413
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,900
all right, everybody, get out
a piece of paper and a pen.

414
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:00,300
why?

415
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,900
because this is
a literature class.

416
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,000
when archaeologists
uncover lost civilizations

417
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,500
and they unearth these worlds

418
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,400
that have
long since been destroyed,

419
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,100
you know what they find
most often?

420
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,500
they find stories --

421
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,900
ancient languages, words,
inscriptions

422
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,000
from people who've been gone
for thousands of years

423
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,300
because chances are,
they, like you,

424
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,400
they wanted to know,
"what's the point?"

425
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,200
and they wanted us to know
that they were here, you know?

426
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,900
like...

427
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,900
they told their stories,
and they tried to make sense

428
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,400
out of their lives and their
worlds and their tragedies.

429
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,700
so that's what we're gonna do.

430
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,800
so i want you to write
something, anything at all,

431
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,400
about quentin fields.

432
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,600
if you knew him,
write a favorite memory.

433
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,200
if you didn't know him,

434
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:03,500
write what you think
the point is of all this

435
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,700
for yourself and your life
and your time here.

436
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,600
this is a literature class,
and that's what writers do.

437
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,900
we put pen to paper
in times of devastating tragedy.

438
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:20,000
and we just try
and make sense of it.

439
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:23,500
maybe we'll find clarity
in some of those words.

440
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,700
maybe we'll find peace.

441
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,100
who wrote this?

442
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,300
i did.

443
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,300
give me your marker.

444
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,600
"he who does not weep
does not see."

445
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,000
what's the from?

446
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,800
"les misRables."

447
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,200
"the miserable ones."

448
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,300
nice shirt.

449
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,600
clothes over bros,
right?

450
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,300
how come you're
getting dressed up again?

451
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,400
because, uh, mommy and daddy

452
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,200
are gonna go
to quentin's funeral,

453
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,400
and you're gonna go
to the sitter's, remember?

454
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,200
and what happens there,
exactly -- at the funeral?

455
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,800
we're gonna say goodbye
to quentin, honey.

456
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:20,100
jamie loved q.

457
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,600
it's got to be hard
for nathan and haley

458
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,200
to explain it all to him,
you know?

459
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,400
well, maybe
after they explain it to him,

460
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,300
they can explain it
to me.

461
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,600
how's the team doing?
not so good.

462
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,700
i mean,
i wouldn't be surprised

463
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,900
if they forfeit
the rest of the season.

464
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,390
it's really nice
having you here,

465
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,490
especially now.

466
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,490
i know we haven't really
talked much about the wedding.

467
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:50,090
oh, god, luke,
the wedding can wait.

468
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,990
i mean, this is
what a marriage is, right --

469
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,390
the good times
and the bad?

470
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,990
i just wish
i could help you somehow.

471
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,490
peyton, you help me so much
without saying a word.

472
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:04,490
and i love you.

473
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,190
i love you.

474
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:22,990
who is it?

475
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:25,490
nathan.

476
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,590
hi, nate.
hi.

477
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:34,690
come on in.

478
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:42,390
it's a tough day, huh?

479
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:43,690
yeah.

480
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,390
i wish there was something

481
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,990
i could do for you
or haley or jamie.

482
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,490
well, actually,
we were wondering

483
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,290
if there's anything
we could do for you.

484
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:55,390
how do you mean?
why me?

485
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,390
well, i know
that your mom

486
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,490
has been pulling some stuff
with the company,

487
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,690
and -- i don't know --

488
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:02,690
and i guess having dealt
with parent insanity,

489
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:07,590
i just wanted to check your head
and see how you're doing.

490
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:11,090
i'm fine. really.

491
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:13,490
that sounds like something
i would say.

492
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:17,890
look, this thing
with losing quentin is --

493
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:19,790
it's hard.

494
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,590
and i have a feeling
it's gonna be

495
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:24,090
a pretty prominent thing
in our lives for a while.

496
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:28,290
it doesn't mean that your
problems are any less important,

497
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:31,690
that all of us
aren't here for you.

498
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:34,690
look, like i said --

499
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,090
you're fine.
you can handle it.

500
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,590
it's all good.

501
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:42,190
look, i hope that's true,
and maybe it is,

502
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,190
but...

503
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,990
the thing is,

504
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:48,190
the two of us have been down
very similar roads.

505
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,490
i mean, we were
in the same cliques first.

506
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:53,190
we both felt the same pressures,
same expectations.

507
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:55,490
our parents
were like children,

508
00:33:55,590 --> 00:33:59,290
and we both grew into kind
of bad versions of ourselves

509
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:00,890
way too fast.

510
00:34:00,890 --> 00:34:04,490
so i think you know
i get it.

511
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:08,290
they never really gave us
a chance, did they --

512
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:10,390
our parents?

513
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:12,190
they didn't know how.

514
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:16,090
look, the thing is,

515
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,590
you made your dream happen,
all right?

516
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:21,190
and even though
i didn't quite get there,

517
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,490
when it was taken away from me,
i dealt with it alone.

518
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:27,290
that was stupid,
selfish, and wrong.

519
00:34:27,390 --> 00:34:31,290
so if your mom tries to take
your dream away from you

520
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:33,490
and you feel that same pain
i did,

521
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,490
i've sort of been there,
okay?

522
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,390
i'm gonna be
kind of kissed off

523
00:34:37,390 --> 00:34:41,290
if you don't
come talk to me about it.

524
00:34:41,290 --> 00:34:43,590
anyway, thank you
for coming today.

525
00:34:43,590 --> 00:34:44,890
it means a lot.

526
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:46,590
i know
you didn't know quentin,

527
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,190
but...
it doesn't surprise me

528
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,190
that you're thinking
about other people

529
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,690
when all this stuff
is going on with you.

530
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,590
that's not bad for a girl
who never had a chance.

531
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,690
jamie, we're going --

532
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:32,490
i want to go.

533
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,690
jamie...

534
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,190
quentin was my friend,

535
00:35:35,290 --> 00:35:36,990
and i want
to say goodbye, too.

536
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:45,690
it's gonna be really sad,
buddy.

537
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:48,390
i'm already sad.

538
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,390
you're right.

539
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,690
quentin was your friend
and a good one.

540
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:01,990
you should say goodbye.

541
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:15,290
the lord is my shepherd.

542
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,590
i shall not want.

543
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:21,290
he maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

544
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:24,290
he leadeth me
beside still waters.

545
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,890
he restoreth my soul.

546
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,090
he leadeth me
in the paths of righteousness

547
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:31,890
for his name's sake...

548
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:28,190
we're to celebrate the homegoing
of young quentin fields.

549
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,090
i'm sorry for your loss.

550
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,790
shut up.

551
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:40,290
you lost a son.

552
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:42,290
what was his name?

553
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:48,790
you know you can't replace him
with my grandson.

554
00:37:48,790 --> 00:37:52,490
somewhere deep down
inside...

555
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:54,790
you know he's not
coming back.

556
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:59,290
no matter what you do,

557
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:02,990
your son is not
coming back.

558
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:23,290
we celebrate the life
of brother quentin...

559
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,590
quentin fields
was a basketball player.

560
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,990
he was also a son...

561
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,590
...a brother...

562
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:48,290
somebody's teammate...

563
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,690
...and somebody's friend.

564
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:56,390
i never knew quentin fields.

565
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,290
and i guess now i never will.

566
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,790
grief is like the ocean.

567
00:40:06,890 --> 00:40:10,690
it's deep and dark
and bigger than all of us.

568
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,390
and pain is like a thief
in the night...

569
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:34,290
...quiet, persistent, unfair...

570
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:47,290
...diminished by time
and faith and love.

571
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:02,790
i didn't know quentin fields,
but i'm jealous of him,

572
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:06,890
because i see how his absence
has affected the people

573
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,590
who did know him,

574
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:11,690
so i know
that he mattered to them.

575
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:14,790
and i know he was loved.

576
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,590
people say quentin fields was
a great basketball player --

577
00:41:55,590 --> 00:42:00,490
graceful, fluid, inspiring.

578
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,190
they say, on a good night,

579
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,690
it almost seemed
as though he could fly.

580
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,790
and now he can.

581
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:15,200
