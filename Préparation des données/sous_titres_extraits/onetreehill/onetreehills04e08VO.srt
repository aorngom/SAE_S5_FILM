1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:03,600
????

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,200
??????

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:06,300
???????

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,100
I'm your new english teacher -- Mr. Chavez.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:08,800
Nick?

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,200
Well, i don't know who i hate more, mr. Chavez...

7
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,200
you for being a lying bastard

8
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,900
Or me for believing your crap.

9
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:20,700
I'm gonna ask you out.

10
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,300
Like on a date?
Just wanted to let you know.

11
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:25,800
There's nothing going on
between me and pton.

12
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,800
And there's nothing going on
between us, either,

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,100
So why are you still here?

14
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
Give me your hand.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,900
I'm gonna get her back.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You can't help who you love, peyton.

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,400
I want to go to duke with you. Oh, haley.

18
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,600
Daunte, i don't have your money yet.

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,900
I could forget the amount.

20
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,900
The ravens are favored to win
by 10 points tonight.

21
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,900
We're a lock to win 
by a lot more than that.

22
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:50,000
Well, not if you want 
your debt to go away.

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,100
Mouth: the ravens have won by 9!

24
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,000
They're heading to 
the state championship!

25
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,200
Nathan: i wanted to say thanks.

26
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:00,400
I know how hard it was for you
to throw those points away.

27
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,900
You know i'll always be there for you...

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,200
but never again.

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,600
There's no reason
you guys should be here anymore.

30
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,100
We're done.

31
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,100
Hear that, bear?
The kid says we're done.

32
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,000
Maybe we should leave.

33
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,400
I made sure that
we won by less than 10 points.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,500
That was the deal.

35
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,700
Yeah. Well, i thought about it.

36
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,300
I think i'm gonna extend our partnership.

37
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,400
What are you talking about?

38
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,200
State championship --

39
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,400
A lot of people think
we're gonna win tomorrow night.

40
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,400
Those people are right.

41
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,600
No, they're not.

42
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,100
I'm not gonna lose that game.

43
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,100
Think about next year, nate.

44
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,700
You're gonna be 
a duke blue devil,
get to play on tv.

45
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:53,700
Wonder what duke would do 
if they found out

46
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,700
That their star recruit 
shaved some points

47
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,900
In a high school basketball game.

48
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,300
Like anybody would believe you.

49
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,800
I got proof.

50
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,900
Your last game was
your worst game of the year.

51
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,300
What -- Eight turnovers?

52
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
You missed three lay-Ups
in the fourth quarter.

53
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,100
Even bear thought that was a bit much.

54
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,200
All it takes is a whisper,
and your future's over.

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,200
Would you risk your future

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,700
And the future of your pretty little wife

57
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,100
For a meaningless trophy?

58
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,900
Yeah. That's right.

59
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,000
Think it over.

60
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm sure you'll do the right thing.

61
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:45,600
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

62
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,300
F?

63
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,400
Me?

64
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,300
Hey, stranger.

65
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,600
Hey. Brooke,
what are you doing here?

66
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
I thought maybe
we could ride to school together.

67
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:35,700
You gonna invite me in?

68
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,600
Yeah. Yeah. Come on in.

69
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,300
Sorry.

70
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,500
Lucas, i miss you.

71
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,800
Okay, i guess i thought

72
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,900
You were gonna say you miss me, too.

73
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh. Brooke, of course i miss you.

74
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,300
I'm just a little confused.

75
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,900
You show up on my doorstep out of the blue

76
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,500
After ignoring me for the past month.

77
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,800
I've just been thinking a lot about you and us,

78
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,600
And i thought that was enough.

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,500
Brooke, i-I don't know.

80
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:14,500
Because of peyton?

81
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,100
You're never gonna let that go, are you?

82
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,900
For the last time,

83
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,800
Peyton and i are just friends, okay?

84
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,100
"Just friends"?

85
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:33,300
Well, at least you're enjoying the benefits.

86
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,500
It --

One Tree Hill 408

90
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,700
Cutting it kind of close, huh?

91
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,500
I overslept.
No, you didn't.

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:29,600
Are you forgetting?
We sleep in the same bed.

93
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,000
I know one person 
that's not gonna forget it 
anytime soon.

94
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,600
Oh -- Brooke. 
Yeah, i'm sorry about that.

95
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,900
That must have been 
really weird for you.

96
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:37,100
It's okay.
I actually have bigger news to report.

97
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:40,800
They caught him -- Derek,
or whatever his name is.

98
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,400
He's in jail. It's over.

99
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,800
Oh, my god. Oh, that's great, peyton. Thanks.

100
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,400
You can, uh, 
sleep in your own bed now, huh?

101
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,500
Lucky me.

102
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,800
Why did brooke come over this morning --

103
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,700
Some kind of morning
-Dew booty call?

104
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
She said she misses me.

105
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,800
Do you want her to miss you?

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,500
I don't know.

107
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Look, i know you can
take care of yourself.

108
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,000
Just be careful, okay?

109
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,300
What happened to you this morning?

110
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:14,400
I...kind of went to see lucas.

111
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Uh-Oh.

112
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,000
Should have seen that coming.

113
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,700
Should have seen what coming?

114
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,400
Well, it's obvious that 
you're rebounding from nick.

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,600
It's normal to want to re-Tap 
an old keg after a breakup.

116
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,200
That is not what this is about, 
and i don't even like beer.

117
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm just worried that i might 
have screwed up a good thing.

118
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,200
You know, i do miss him. 
What if i made a mistake?

119
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,700
Trust me, brooke. You didn't.

120
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,500
????
What if i only broke up with him

121
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,700
Because i was mad at peyton?

122
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,600
What if you just realized
you didn't love him anymore?

123
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,600
Okay, look...

124
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,200
what you need to do is focus.

125
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,800
You are organizing tonight's 
basketball awards banquet.

126
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
I can't wait to get out of here.

127
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,200
I'm so excited graduation's coming.

128
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,800
Yeah, for some of us.

129
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,600
Hey, don't forget that you promised

130
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,500
To help me decorate for the banquet today.

131
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,900
Yeah, remind me to quit making drunken promises.

132
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,600
I'll meet you there after school.

133
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,700
I got to deal with something.

134
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,200
Hi, mouth. Bye, mouth.

135
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,900
Hey, rachel.

136
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:14,000
[ Gasps ] gigi, hi.

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Didn't see you coming.

138
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,400
I'm sneaky like that.

139
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,400
Good to know.

140
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,900
I just wanted to tell you 
i had a great time on our date.

141
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,200
So did i. It was definitely not boring.

142
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,000
Walk me to class?

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,500
Yeah.

144
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,100
You wanted to see me, coach?

145
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,500
Yeah. Come on in, nathan.

146
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,000
Have a seat.

147
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,500
I just wanted to tell you that, uh,

148
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,900
You're getting the most valuable player trophy

149
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,400
At tonight's banquet.

150
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,500
I'd like to ask lucas to present it to you.

151
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,400
Okay.

152
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,300
I also found out the alumni are giving me

153
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,000
Some kind of a lifetime-Achievement thing.

154
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,900
Coach, that's great. You deserve it.

155
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,200
I don't know. "Lifetime achievement"?

156
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,200
Sounds like an obituary to me.

157
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,600
It still hasn't sunk in that...

158
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,400
..tomorrow night's game 
is the last one i'll ever coach.

159
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,900
Yeah.

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,300
Can you keep a secret?

161
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,800
I really want this championship.

162
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,800
Here, take mr. Kelly's english quiz

163
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,500
Down to the tutor center and file it.

164
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,500
Then bring me back my key, okay?

165
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,300
Thanks.

166
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,900
Miss gatina?

167
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,300
A little early for you to be at school, isn't it?

168
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,400
Kind of. Um, quick question --

169
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,000
If someone was failing calculus 
this late in the year,

170
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,400
What would that mean?

171
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,700
Well, calculus is a part of 
the school's core curriculum.

172
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,700
So if one were to fail it,

173
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,500
That student would not 
graduate with their class.

174
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,000
That's what i thought. Thanks.

175
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Can i give you some advice, rachel?

176
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's no secret you flirt your way 
through high school.

177
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,500
You're a pretty girl,

178
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,100
And you can bluff a lot of people.

179
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:12,300
But you can't bluff math.

180
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,600
Study for your final, okay?

181
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
And graduate with your friends.

182
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
Oh, i'm sorry.

183
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,000
You know, some people actually eat lunch

184
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,200
During their lunch break.

185
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,700
Well, good for them. 
Unfortunately, we need money.

186
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,400
????????

187
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,800
It might give us some extra breathing room.

188
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,400
Check this out.

189
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,800
What is this breathing room.

190
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,200
You made all this today?

191
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Yeah, on one table. That's them leaving now.

192
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,400
Hey, guys! Please come again.

193
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,300
Count on it.

194
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,800
Hey, uh,
i'll see you back at school,
okay? Okay.

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,100
Bye. See ya.

196
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,400
Hey! This is over!

197
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,000
Stay away from me, 
stay away from my wife,

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,700
And forget about the state championship.

199
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,600
It's not gonna happen.

200
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:13,700
You can tell duke whatever you want. 
Now we're done.

201
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,500
You really think all 
we're gonna do is tell duke?

202
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,400
Come here!

203
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,800
What?! No! Aah!

204
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,300
You want to mess around, huh?!

205
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,600
Hold his leg up!

206
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,000
No!

207
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,100
Say goodbye to basketball! 
You won't play anywhere.

208
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,900
Hell, you'll be lucky to walk again.

209
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,800
It didn't have to come to this.

210
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,400
No!

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Here's my final tip to you.

212
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,600
Lose that game!

213
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,700
You sure about the color?

214
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,300
'Cause this is starting to look like that scene

215
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,600
In "the shining" with those creepy little twins.

216
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,000
Oh, am i boring you?

217
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,300
Just say the word, 
and i can stop painting your room.

218
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,600
I'm sorry.

219
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I'm just dealing with 
some stupid high school boy drama.

220
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,800
Lucas, huh?

221
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,300
Is it that obvious?

222
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,800
Only to everyone.

223
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,300
Everyone except lucas.

224
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,100
So make it obvious to him.

225
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,500
I don't understand 
why you're so afraid of 
your own feelings.

226
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,900
Well, those feelings

227
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,600
Are what destroyed 
my friendship with brooke.

228
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,100
And i don't want to lose lucas, too.

229
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,000
What have i been trying to teach you?

230
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,400
You can't live in fear.

231
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,100
Life is about taking risks,

232
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,500
Not being afraid to go after what you want.

233
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,300
I'm just not sure this is the right time.

234
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,300
It never is. That's why it's called a risk.

235
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,500
You got that banquet tonight.
Ask him to go with you.

236
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,100
Maybe i should.

237
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,700
Look, i got to get back to school.

238
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,400
But the room really is 
looking so much better.

239
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,600
I'll tell you what --

240
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,400
I'll promise to have this room done 
by the time you get home

241
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,700
If you promise to take a risk today.

242
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,200
Deal?

243
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,000
Okay.

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,500
Deal.

245
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,400
All right.

246
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
No fear!

247
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,700
Hey, nathan.

248
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,300
Luke, not now, okay? I'm not in the mood.

249
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,300
Look, whitey asked me to present you 
with the mvp award.

250
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,800
If you have a problem with that, just say no.

251
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,600
No, i'll do it, but before i do,

252
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,400
I need to know 
if i'm presenting nathan scott the mvp

253
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,000
Or nathan scott the point shaver.

254
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,500
Lucas, i don't need another lecture, okay?

255
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,700
I didn't ask you to miss those free throws.

256
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,800
If you don't want to give me
the stupid award, don't.

257
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
You told me this was over, nathan.

258
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,300
Just promise me that it is.

259
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,300
Peyton, i brought you something.

260
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,600
Thought you could use it.

261
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,100
Am i missing something?

262
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,000
It's a to-Go box -- 
Since you're screwing my leftovers.

263
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,400
Really, brooke?

264
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,800
You seriously went through the trouble

265
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,500
Of bringing me an actual to-Go box?

266
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,900
At least you're a dedicated bitch.

267
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,400
Says the dedicated slut.

268
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,200
For the record, i'm not screwing lucas.

269
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I know you have trouble comprehending

270
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,500
Two people in bed together actually just sleeping.

271
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,600
Remember, peyton, i gave lucas to you,

272
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,500
And i can take him back whenever i want.

273
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,600
Brooke, are you listening to yourself?

274
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,700
If you decide to get back with lucas,

275
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,200
You better mean it,

276
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,600
'Cause he deserves to be
with somebody who loves him.

277
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,900
Someone like you?

278
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,600
Luke, can i talk to you?

279
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,100
Well, that depends.You gonn?????

280
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,500
Uh, sounds like fun,

281
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,400
But probably too many people around for that.

282
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,600
[ Chuckles ] look, about this morning --

283
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,800
Listen, you don't have to explain.

284
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
It's none of my business. 
I shouldn't have interrupted.

285
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,200
Well, you weren't interrupting anything.

286
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,600
Peyton's been sleeping over

287
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,400
'Cause that crazy stalker guy's been missing.

288
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,400
But they finally caught him, 
so she's safe now.

289
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,900
So she won't be sleeping over anymore.

290
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,300
No.

291
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,800
But even if she was, you know, 
why would you care?

292
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Luke, the reason that i came over this morning

293
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,100
Was to ask if you wanted to 
go to the banquet with me.

294
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,000
You mean, like a date?

295
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Or as friends.

296
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,700
We should be able to be friends, right?

297
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,500
I kind of remember asking you 
that same question once.

298
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,400
And you were right, okay?

299
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,300
I know that now. 
So, what do you say?

300
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,100
Yeah. I'll go to the banquet with you.

301
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:07,900
Okay. I'll see you later, then.

302
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,400
In case you were wondering, 
the nurse's office

303
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,100
Is still the best place 
to treat a venereal disease.

304
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,000
That's good to know.

305
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,200
Actually, i was looking for you. 
I need you to tutor me.

306
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:27,000
[ Laughs ] oh, god, she's serious.

307
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,700
I'm failing calculus, 
and if i don't pass,

308
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,200
I won't be able to 
graduate with my friends.

309
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
Remind me who your friends are again.

310
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,500
Look, haley, 
i know we've had our differences. 
You think?

311
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,300
I've seen what you can do

312
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,900
With some of those brain-Dead losers 
at our school,

313
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,300
And i'm actually smart.

314
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,400
I've just skipped too many classes,

315
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,800
And i can't catch up on my own.

316
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,000
Well, if you're really committed to this,

317
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,300
I will be happy to 
recommend another tutor to you.

318
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,300
But i can't help you personally. 
It's not possible.

319
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,000
Oh, i figured you'd be all booked up.

320
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,500
No, no. I have plenty of time.

321
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,000
I just can't stand you.

322
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,100
Five visits in one week --

323
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,400
I think you've just 
become my most loyal customer.

324
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,100
What can i get you?

325
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,000
Actually, i came by to see

326
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,500
If you were going to the awards banquet.

327
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,400
Yeah, i wouldn't miss it.

328
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,200
Well, in that case, 
how about we go together?

329
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,900
Not as a date -- 
Just two people attending 
the same event,

330
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,800
Riding in the same car, 
possibly sitting at the same table.

331
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,100
Look, dan, i appreciate everything

332
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,000
That you've done for me lately,

333
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
But i can't.

334
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,200
I'm sorry.

335
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
No, i understand. 
I'll see you there.

336
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,800
Hey, sawyer.

337
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,700
Thanks for diting me at lunch.

338
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Sorry. Derek's repainting my room.

339
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,200
I figured the least i could do 
is keep him company.

340
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,100
You two are getting pretty close, huh?

341
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,500
Um, i guess so. 
He's still annoying as hell.

342
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,100
He seems to have an opinion about everything.

343
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:01,000
Remind you of anyone? 
Uh, if you mean you, then, yes.

344
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,800
So, look, i was wondering.

345
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,900
Um...do you want to go to the banquet tonight,

346
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,400
Like, together?

347
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,800
I'd love to, but...

348
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:14,400
..but i -- I don't know.

349
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
There's some weirdness going on 
between you and brooke.

350
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,999
At does that have to do with us 
going to the banquet?

351
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I already told brooke i'd go with her.

352
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,400
Oh.

353
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,000
I feel bad.

354
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
It would just be great 
if we could all go together.

355
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,500
No. No. It's -- It's cool.

356
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,900
Really, it's not a big deal.

357
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,800
I just didn't know you two --

358
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,300
No, no, no, no. I don't know if we are.

359
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,200
I guess i'll find out tonight.

360
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,400
Wish me luck.

361
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,200
Look at this thing.

362
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,000
 These are ugly.

363
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,500
Yeah, they're pretty ugly. Who cares?

364
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,700
I do!
I don't want tacky flowers

365
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,900
Sucking the energy out of the room.

366
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,600
Why are you so concerned 
about this stupid banquet?

367
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,100
[ Sighs ] 'cause i asked lucas to go with me.

368
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,200
Brooke, what are you thinking?

369
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,000
Go sleep with him if you're horny.

370
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,200
Don't go to the banquet with him.

371
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,600
What you're feeling isn't real.

372
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:15,900
Well, maybe you're wrong.

373
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
These are wrong.

374
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,300
You know what this means, don't you?

375
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,100
You have a date for tonight, and i don't.

376
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,400
Well, you may not have a date,

377
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,400
But you have a seating 
chart you can help me with.

378
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,700
Oh. Well, you've got a problem.

379
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,600
Do you realize 
who you have sitting at this table?

380
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,700
I know exactly who i have sitting at that table.

381
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,800
Then we are in for a fun night.

382
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,500
Hey.

383
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,600
Oh, mouth, i need you to be my date 
for the banquet tonight.

384
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,800
I'll pick you up at 6:00, 
and don't wear the drakkar.

385
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,100
Sorry, rachel, i'm going with gigi.

386
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,400
In fact, um, i better go home and get ready.

387
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,300
But the room looks really great, you guys.

388
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,600
Those flowers are awesome.

389
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,800
Okay, we are losing the flowers.

390
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,600
And it looks like you're going solo. Sorry.

391
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,000
Or not.

392
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,800
Hello?

393
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,700
Yes, sir.

394
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,200
Yes, sir. I understand.

395
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,100
Yes, sir.

396
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,800
Yes, sir.

397
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
Are you kidding me?

398
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,900
This place looks great! 
I can't believe you finished.

399
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,800
Just holding up my end of the bargain.

400
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,600
The question is, did you?

401
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,000
Yeah. I took a risk.

402
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,800
Are you gonna leave me hanging?

403
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,500
He's going to the banquet with brooke.

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,300
I'm sorry, peyton.

405
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,800
At least you put yourself out there.

406
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,600
I'm proud of you. Thanks.

407
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,000
So, i kind of need a favor.

408
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Um, will you go with me?

409
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,900
And i'm not sure i can handle another "no."

410
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
I'd be honored to.

411
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:58,100
Cool.

412
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,700
You got a special place for this?

413
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,800
I used to.

414
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,900
I don't think i need it anymore.

415
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,300
Hey. Hey!

416
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,800
I heard you're presenting nathan 
with the mvp award tonight.

417
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,700
That's awesome. Do you need a ride?

418
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,900
??????

419
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,800
Uh, actually, um, i'm going with brooke.

420
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Rewind. When did this happen?

421
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,400
She asked me today.

422
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,100
Are you back together? 
You guys think i'm crazy.

423
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,700
I don't think you're crazy, luke.

424
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:32,300
I mean, maybe brooke thinks she's made a mistake.

425
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,800
Everybody deserves a second chance.

426
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,900
I agree. I think you guys are good together.

427
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,600
Oh, hey...

428
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,000
rachel asked me to tutor her.

429
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
You're tutoring rachel?

430
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,800
Hell, no. I said she asked me.

431
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,700
What happened to second chances?

432
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,800
Uh, rachel's had plenty of second chances,

433
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,600
And every time, she's proven her true colors.

434
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,400
I'm just saying. People make mistakes.

435
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,000
But if they're willing to put the past behind them,

436
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,300
Then maybe we should, too.

437
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,900
Right, mom?

438
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,800
Right.

439
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,000
Right.

440
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
It's not a date.

441
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,200
Wow! Déj?vu!

442
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,400
Dan scott and karen roe, together again.

443
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,100
I hear you're pregnant, too.

444
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,700
It is just like our high school prom.

445
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,700
Shari, is your son tim even on the basketball team anymore?

446
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,900
Actually, timmy is doing really well.

447
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,200
He's at a private institution that focuses specifically

448
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,200
On each student's strengths and weaknesses.

449
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,800
Just say he's slow, shari.

450
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,300
Rachel, are we at the same table?

451
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Sort of. I think there's been a mistake.

452
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:20,700
Where's gigi supposed to sit?

453
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Oh, gigi, i'm sorry.

454
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,400
You were a last-Minute add,

455
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,500
So i had to seat you at another table.

456
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:31,500
That's okay, 'cause now i've got the best seat in the house.

457
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:35,900
Let me get you a chair.

458
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
We're at table five.

459
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,500
No fear.

460
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,300
Everyone, for those of you who don't know,

461
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:23,000
This is my brother derek -- The real one.

462
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,100
Hey.

463
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,900
How you doing?

464
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,600
Nice to meet you.

465
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,900
What's up?

466
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,500
Hey.

467
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,000
So, guys, is tree hill gonna win

468
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,500
The state championship this year?

469
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
I don't know. Hey, nathan, are we gonna win tomorrow?

470
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:42,900
We're gonna try.

471
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,600
Anybody else need a drink?

472
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,800
Well, he seems nice -- Derek.

473
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,500
Yeah, he's a good guy.

474
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,700
You should really get to know him.

475
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,800
What's the point?

476
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,500
Besides, tonight's about us, right?

477
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,900
How's haley doing?

478
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:19,900
She's, uh, grown into a strong woman.

479
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,700
I can't believe she's gonna be a mom.

480
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,700
It seems like yesterday that she was coming

481
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,900
And asking lucas to come out and play.

482
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,300
You know, they're definitely young.

483
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,100
But at least they have each other.

484
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,800
Nathan's gonna be a great father.

485
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,200
Karen, i realize you have no regrets, but i do.

486
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,600
I just need you to know that.

487
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,800
Good evening, everybody.

488
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,700
Tonight, i've been asked to present

489
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,100
A very important award to a very important person.

490
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,400
The most valuable player award

491
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,600
Honors not only the best player on the court,

492
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
But also a true leader off the court.

493
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,600
An mvp leads a team not only in points or rebounds,

494
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,900
But also leads by example.

495
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,900
And we are very proud to 
follow in the footsteps of our leader

496
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,600
And our most valuable player, nathan scott.

497
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
You're our leader, nate.

498
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,500
I'm, uh, i'm not very good at speeches,

499
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,900
So i just wanted to thank my teammates -- Guys --

500
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,600
And, most of all, coach whitey durham

501
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,200
For, uh, giving me a year 
that i'll always remember.

502
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,100
Thanks, coach.

503
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,100
???

504
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,300
Thanks.

505
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,900
Hey, proud wifey.

506
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,600
Hi.

507
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,800
Did nathan look nervous to you at all?

508
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,800
Well, he looked like the star of the basketball team.

509
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,900
Yeah, he did, didn't he? Yeah.

510
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,100
Um, okay.

511
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,000
Rachel told me she asked you for help,

512
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,100
And you turned her down.

513
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,500
Yeah. Can you blame me?

514
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,000
She's been hitting on nathan for a month.

515
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,600
I know. She has flaws -- Big ones.

516
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,900
But, deep down, i promise you, 
she's a really good person.

517
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,700
Oh, my god, you and lucas with your second chances.

518
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,700
I cannot help her!

519
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,400
I'm not saying you have to tutor her.

520
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,100
I'm just saying she's been really good to me lately.

521
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,100
So think about it, okay?

522
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Hey, private, you hanging in there?

523
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,600
Trying my best.

524
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,800
Thanks for coming with me tonight.

525
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:16,300
Without you, i would have left a long time ago.

526
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,800
Peyton, i need to tell you something.

527
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:23,300
My unit is deploying in 24 hours.

528
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,600
"Deploying"?

529
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,700
I take it that's marine for you're leaving?

530
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,600
I leave for assignment tomorrow.

531
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,200
How long have you known? I got the call today.

532
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:33,800
I was waiting for the right time to tell you.

533
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,200
I'm supposed to be back at the base by now.

534
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,900
Why aren't you?

535
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,800
Because my little sister needed me.

536
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,400
I guess i should have let you hang that drawing.

537
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:53,000
As most of you know,

538
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:56,700
Tomorrow night is coach whitey durham's final game.

539
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,700
And to show our appreciation 
for his dedication and excellence,

540
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,800
We present him tonight 
with a lifetime-Achievement award.

541
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,600
So, without further ado,

542
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,900
I give you your coach, whitey durham.

543
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,300
You do realize we have one more game to play.

544
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,000
Let me tell you --

545
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,100
This award means an awful lot to me.

546
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,600
I might have given a lifetime to this team...

547
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,300
but the players --

548
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,000
The players have given me so much more.

549
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,200
You know, basketball was my first love.

550
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,800
And, as most of you in here realize,

551
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,000
You don't forget your first love.

552
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,300
My only regret is

553
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:07,300
That i can't share this wonderful moment

554
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,700
With the other love of my life...

555
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,100
..my late wife, camilla.

556
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Camilla was the only person 
who ever fully understood me.

557
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Being with her made everything else 
seem less important.

558
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,500
The moment i met her,

559
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,500
I knew that i was looking at my future.

560
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,400
And i knew no person

561
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:41,400
Could ever come between us.

562
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,100
I know camilla would have liked this group of boys.

563
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,300
I want to thank them.

564
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,100
And i want to thank all of you

565
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,700
For allowing me...

566
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,200
to spend a lifetime

567
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,900
With my first love.

568
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,300
Thank you.

569
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,900
Dad, i need to talk to you.

570
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,400
Excuse me.

571
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,600
I'm in trouble, dad. How bad is it?

572
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,300
Bad enough that i need you.

573
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,900
I borrowed some money from these guys,

574
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,500
And i couldn't pay them back,

575
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:43,300
So they asked me to 
shave a few points 
in the last game.

576
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,400
Tell me you didn't do it.

577
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,000
How could you be so stupid?!

578
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,400
I came to you for help!

579
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,900
I needed you, and you said no! I didn't have a choice!

580
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:56,400
And now they want me

581
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,200
To throw the state championship tomorrow night.

582
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,500
You got to help me, dad.

583
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,300
Tell me their names.

584
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,500
Daunte and bear.

585
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,900
Damn it, nathan.

586
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,600
Go back inside.
I'll take care of this.

587
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,400
Dad...

588
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,400
i'm sorry.

589
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,999
I'm sorry, karen. Something urgent came up.

590
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I have to go.

591
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,800
That's okay. I can find another ride home.

592
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,100
Are you sure? Yeah. I'll be fine.

593
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,700
It's not like this was a date or anything, remember?

594
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,200
If you say so.

595
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,800
I just have one question.

596
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
What, no props?

597
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,600
If you're sleeping in lucas' bed,

598
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,300
Why haven't you told him how you feel?

599
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,000
I told y i was not gonna say anything to lucas

600
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,500
Until it was over between the two of you.

601
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,000
So, yes, if you had moved on,

602
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,300
I probably would have said something by now, but...

603
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,500
you haven't dated anybody since lucas.

604
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:37,300
You had your chance, peyton. 
You should have said something.

605
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,200
It doesn't matter now, does it?

606
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,800
Los like the two of you are getting back together.

607
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:45,000
I was mad at you 
when i asked him to come with me tonight.

608
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,600
So you invited him out of spite?

609
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,700
No, not at first.

610
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,400
Now i don't know anymore.

611
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,700
Mayor dan scott.

612
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:20,200
Are we sitting at your table, danny?

613
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,500
I understand you've had 
a little misunderstanding with my son.

614
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,600
Now, we're all businessmen,

615
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,100
So, uh, how much is it gonna 
take to make this all go away?

616
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,800
Take a hike, bitches.

617
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Daunte?

618
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,400
All right. Go on. Go on.

619
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,300
Let me ask you a question, mr. Mayor.

620
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,500
Where the hell do you think you are?

621
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,500
Think you can settle this with a checkbook?

622
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,600
Unless you're prepared to write a check for all the money

623
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,200
That the gamblers stand to win tomorrow night

624
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
When your son loses...

625
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,700
or, rather, your sons.

626
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:05,700
You don't scare me. You're just a couple of punks.

627
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,600
And this is what's gonna happen.

628
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,000
You stay away from my son, 
whether i give you money or not.

629
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,800
Do you understand?

630
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,400
It's awful comforting having 
so many people close to you,

631
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,400
Isn't it?

632
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,700
For example, your ex-Wife,

633
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,700
Your cute little daughter-In-Law...

634
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,700
a couple sons.

635
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:25,300
Oh, and let's not forget karen roe and her baby.

636
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,100
Be an awful shame if the ground next to your brother

637
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,900
Started getting real crowded, don't you think?

638
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,000
Here's a tip for you, mr. Mayor.

639
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,500
Bet against the ravens tomorrow night.

640
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,000
Make yourself some money.

641
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,300
Get the hell out of here.

642
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,300
I'm so proud of you.

643
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,800
I wish people would stop saying that.

644
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,800
Why?

645
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,000
What is going on with you? 
You've been so distant all day.

646
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Is it the game?

647
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,000
No. I'm fine.

648
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,600
I'm just -- I'm feeling a lot of pressure lately, i guess.

649
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,300
I'm sorry.

650
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,400
Yeah, you know what?

651
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
For the first time in a while,

652
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,600
I think everything's gonna be okay.

653
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,100
Good.

654
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:37,100
So, uh, i got to ask your advice on something.

655
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
All rit.

656
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,900
Rachel asked me to tutor her.

657
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,700
And...

658
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,300
i just wanted to know what you thought i should do.

659
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,000
Well, i remember, not too long ago, i needed a tutor,

660
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,600
And you set aside your feelings and agreed to help me.

661
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,500
Do not compare yourself to rachel.

662
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,100
Well, we all make mistakes -- All of us.

663
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:03,000
Look, you do what you want to do.

664
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,200
But i think you should know that,

665
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,400
When i was freaking out about 
the whole pregnancy thing,

666
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Rachel was the one that got through to me.

667
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,600
Oh, god.

668
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,300
I'm gonna have to tutor rachel, aren't i?

669
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,500
Yeah. Yeah.

670
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,800
I better get back to the base

671
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,200
Before they think i went awol.

672
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,700
I'll drop you off on the way.

673
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,200
It's actually a really beautiful night.

674
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,500
I was thinking maybe i'd walk.

675
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,700
You sure you want to do that?

676
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,200
"No fear," right?

677
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,800
I haven't walked by myself

678
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,300
Since psycho derek disappeared -- The other one.

679
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,300
It would be nice to walk home by myself.

680
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,300
Peyton sawyer, wanting to be alone.

681
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,100
Look how far you've come.

682
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,900
It's because of you.

683
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,400
So i'm -- I'm kind of a pro at this next part,

684
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,500
The "goodbye" part.

685
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,900
People always leave. Remember?

686
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,100
You'll be careful, right?

687
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,300
Don't worry about me.

688
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,800
I won't go trying to be a hero or anything.

689
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,400
Sure, you will.

690
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,500
Come here.

691
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,000
I'll be back, peyton.

692
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,300
I believe you.

693
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,200
Thanks.

694
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,000
Lucas, don't hate me, okay?

695
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,800
But i think that this was a mistake.

696
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,800
So do i.

697
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,600
You do?

698
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,000
I --

699
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,000
I missed you so much 
when you broke up with me, brooke.

700
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,300
I mean, i spent every day

701
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,500
Hoping that maybe we'd get back together.

702
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,500
But...listening to whitey

703
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:28,800
Describe his life with camilla,

704
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,000
I just realized that --
He wasn't describing us.

705
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,600
Do you think that even exists anymore? What?

706
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,100
A love so strong 
that no person can come between it.

707
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,700
I sure hope so.

708
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,000
Yeah.

709
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,700
I guess we'll just have to wait and see.

710
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,400
So, where does this leave us?

711
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,500
Friends?

712
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,300
Friends.

713
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,100
Rachel? Haley.

714
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:27,100
I will tutor you on three conditions.

715
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,400
The first one is that you have to work around my schedule.

716
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,000
I'm working a ton of hours right now,

717
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,800
And i really don't care 
if it disrupts your social life.

718
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,700
The second is, if you miss one session, it's over.

719
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,800
Got it? Got it.

720
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,300
So, what's the third condition?

721
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,200
No matter how nice i seem,

722
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,100
You have to remember...

723
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:48,300
that i can't stand you.

724
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,100
Okay?

725
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:51,100
Humm

726
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Did you talk to them?

727
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,700
Yeah.

728
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,400
What are we gonna do, dad?

729
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,700
You're gonna lose the state championship.

730
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,900
Now, this is more like it.

731
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,400
Listen, i just wanted to say i'm sorry

732
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,600
That we didn't get to spend more time together tonight.

733
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
How'd it go with brooke?

734
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,600
I realized tonight that 
it's over between me and brooke.

735
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,900
And... she realized it, too.

736
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,800
I love you, lucas.

737
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,100
I love you, too, peyton.

738
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,900
You don't understand.

739
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,300
I've been holding this in 
for a really long time.

740
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,700
And you just need to know.

741
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:32,600
I love you.

742
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,000
I'm in love with you.

743
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
