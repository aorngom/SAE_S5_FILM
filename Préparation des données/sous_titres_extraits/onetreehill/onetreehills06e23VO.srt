And the 10th grade
and 11th grade.

355
00:16:31,204 --> 00:16:33,605
And, finally,
in our junior year,

356
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:35,306
Lucas gathered up his courage

357
00:16:35,374 --> 00:16:37,709
And talked to peyton
for the first time

358
00:16:37,777 --> 00:16:39,911
Right here at this lake...

359
00:16:39,979 --> 00:16:41,479

361
00:16:44,917 --> 00:16:46,818
He said,
"haley, i talked to her!"

362
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:50,288
And when i asked him
if the fantasy was finally over,

363
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:51,857
If he could finally admit

364
00:16:51,924 --> 00:16:54,325
That peyton sawyer
was human after all,

365
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,427
He said, "no.

366
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:58,663
"peyton sawyer is not human.

I believe in true love.

I believe in love
at first sight.

371
00:17:08,474 --> 00:17:12,377
I believe love conquers all.

372
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:15,346
And that doesn't mean
there's not gonna be hard days

373
00:17:15,414 --> 00:17:19,550
Or difficult things to deal
with, because there will be.

374
00:17:19,618 --> 00:17:22,687
But finding that person
who does it for you

375
00:17:22,755 --> 00:17:25,223
And knowing that that person
loves you back --

376
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:30,162
It just makes everything
so much easier.

377
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:34,299
"peyton sawyer
will become peyton scott."

378
00:17:34,366 --> 00:17:35,733
That was the dream.

379

You blew it up tonight,

Did you have a good time?

Yeah. i'm a little
bummed, though.

714

I don't think anybody actually
had slutty wedding sex.

Well, not yet.

Bourbon is a good,

No, it's not.

721
00:36:22,063 --> 00:36:24,832
Saw you dancing
with brooke.

722
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,467
Didn't you have a date?

723
00:36:26,535 --> 00:36:28,068
Yeah.

724
00:36:28,136 --> 00:36:29,537
She did, too, right?

725
00:36:31,306 --> 00:36:32,406
What happened to them?

726
00:36:43,318 --> 00:36:45,352
Oh, my god, you look
just like drew.

Would you ask brooke
to call me, please?

737

You do realize
the name of the company

Is clothes over bros, yes?

739
00:37:25,827 --> 00:37:29,930
My father always made me feel
like i wasn't good enough.

740
00:37:29,998 --> 00:37:31,499
Anytime i had any success,

741
00:37:31,566 --> 00:37:34,201
He would remind me
of my failures.

742
00:37:34,268 --> 00:37:35,803
I see that in brooke.

743
00:37:35,871 --> 00:37:39,607
She's so talented and
good-hearted and beautiful,

744
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,108
But she carries around
this feeling

745
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,443
That she's not
good enough.

746
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:46,079
And she has you
to thank for that.

747
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:47,815
Nice work.

I'm in love with her.

752

And one of these days,
she's gonna love me back.

753
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:03,797
And when she does, i want you
to understand something.

754
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:06,901
You're either gonna learn
to be nice to her...

755
00:38:06,968 --> 00:38:09,003
Or you won't
be in her life.
