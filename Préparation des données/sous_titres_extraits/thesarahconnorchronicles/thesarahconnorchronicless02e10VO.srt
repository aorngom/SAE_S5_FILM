1
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:04,030
Previously on terminator,The
sarah connor chronicle.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,510
What did you want it to Show me.

3
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:07,260
We need to learn how they Work.

4
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:08,500
How to fight them

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,620
We are developing a human interactive AI

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,750
The name is babylon

7
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,350
It's going to change the World.

8
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,820
Dr. buoyed sherman.

9
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,580
He's on that wall for a reason.

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,800
Still fuzzy as to why you Called me.

11
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:20,580
The AI needs to be trained.

12
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:21,930
Do you care about this Girl?

13
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:22,540
Yeah.

14
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,580
Leave her alone.

15
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,870
You are pissed off because

16
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,160
I found someone I like spending time with,

17
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,410
and it's Not you.

18
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,150
-Jesse
-Hey, baby.

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,390
What does it mean to you?

20
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,980
I keep seeing it my dreams.

21
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:37,070
It means something.

22
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,060
Go back to bed.

23
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,690
Keep it running.

24
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:56,760
We'll be back.

25
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,430
You got it.

26
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,570
Right place?

27
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,490
Right place.

28
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,480
Should have brought john.

29
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,570
Don't need to know much
About computers to do this.

30
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,580
Get the ones over there.

31
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,320
Same as the rest.

32
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,250
It's vaporware

33
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,260
There is nothing there.

34
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,530
I didn't say that.

35
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,440
It's a design for an AI

36
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,430
Built to handle big problems.

37
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,160
You need a whole server farm To run it,

38
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,700
and they got zip, Less than zip.

39
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,630
after you lobotomize their desktops

40
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,190
But they have a design.

41
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,910
Yeah,it's like all those articles you read

42
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,860
how the Terrorists have
the plans for nuclear bombs

43
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,010
And all they are missing is the plutonium.

44
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:08,300
Another dead-end.

45
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:11,920
Chasing phantoms and
smudges On the wall again.

46
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,420
Artificial intelligence.

47
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:15,300
The company logo,with 3 dots

48
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,460
Our fingerprints left by

49
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,510
That poor bastard while
Bleeding out in the basement.

50
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,810
That's all.It's just blood.

51
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,290
Everything on that wall has Meant something.

52
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,890
It's all blood.

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,390
Cromartie's body is not in Ellison's yard.

54
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,370
Nobody is saying to stop Looking.

55
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,560
But this, it's not the turk.

56
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,000
You have been looking really hard, mom,

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,060
maybe too hard.

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,450
If you are going to start
In, too, don't, okay.

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,070
Good morning.

60
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:14,440
Good morning to you.

61
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:17,490
I did some digging on the drives

62
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,260
The systems is hunting for Start-up money.

63
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,530
Need investors for the server
farm they are going to build.

64
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,680
Big investors.

65
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,210
I made you an appointment.

66
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,500
Here's your cover.

67
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,410
I am a rich divorceee

68
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:39,730
Looking to put my money in Tech start-ups.

69
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,780
That's right.

70
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,560
I also made you a cheat Sheet

71
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,510
so you wouldn't sound Like a total moron

72
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,770
when you Are asking about networks.

73
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:54,090
I have no idea what you just said.

74
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,270
Yeah, that's my point.

75
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,710
Were you up all Night doing this.

76
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,310
A start-up, okay.

77
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,570
So Cyberdyne was

78
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:09,050
Andy good was building a chess Program,

79
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,120
barbara chamberland

80
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,550
Was trying to solve a traffic Problem.

81
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,640
It always starts small.

82
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,770
You got 30 seconds.

83
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,550
Go.

84
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,170
Funny Derek

85
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,190
25.

86
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,440
I'm not joking.

87
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:42,530
I was sent back to find him.

88
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:43,990
You could have told me.

89
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,710
You could have told me
you Were living with him,

90
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,990
with her, It. Metal.

91
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:52,950
Wasn't talking anymore.

92
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,290
Just her.

93
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,160
He is making questionable Decisions.

94
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,540
Getting people killed.

95
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:00,820
Good people.

96
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,580
Ten seconds.

97
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:03,860
She has taken over.

98
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,700
It's sick.

99
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:06,890
It's what it is.

100
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,990
Imagine if he spends the
next 20 years with her.

101
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,080
Imagine what he will become.

102
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,890
What she will turn him into.

103
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:15,690
Just try.

104
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:18,650
I'm here to stop her.

105
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,550
I'm here to save him.

106
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:29,050
I have got to think about this.

107
00:06:30,650 --> 00:06:32,230
What the hell are you doing Here?

108
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,170
Why did connor send you back?

109
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:36,960
I love you.

110
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:39,820
But don't push it.

111
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,100
James Ellison,been a long time.

112
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:03,360
Heard you lost some weight.

113
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,970
Well, too much irony in a Diet is not good.

114
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,420
What've you got?

115
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,380
Heat wave blew a Transformer on sunday,

116
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,190
blacked Out half of downtown.

117
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,580
Single guy working the Weekend.

118
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,630
Spent eight hours in a sealed Room,

119
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,870
no ac, no ventilation.

120
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,340
Heated up until the heat baked Him to death.

121
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,180
Not a happy ending.

122
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,010
His name is dr. buoyed Sherman.

123
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,000
Consultant on a project here.

124
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:33,940
He worked downstairs.

125
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:36,010
Downstairs.

126
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,490
The basement.

127
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,890
We call the project babylon.

128
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,970
Sophisticated computer Program.

129
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,470
An artificial intelligence.

130
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,710
During the blackout,

131
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,360
The A.I. reseerve
generator powered for itself

132
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,040
In doing so shut down the
Building's other systems.

133
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:56,950
This ai, gas control over The building?

134
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:59,220
You make it sound like a Monster movie.

135
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,430
The facility and ai are Interconnected

136
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,020
to the extent That it needs

137
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,610
the facility's Resources to help it grow.

138
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,270
Does growing involve

139
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,090
Allowing to agonizing death
of an otherwise healthy man?

140
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,410
I don't know what his Intentions were.

141
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,310
Intentions.

142
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,440
Now that does osound like a Monster movie.

143
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:27,370
Which is why we need to Find out.

144
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:32,990
Thank you, colonel.

145
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,820
Good to see you.

146
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:42,780
Sarah Gail,Alex,Welcome to Dakara

147
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,310
Have to bear with us,

148
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,910
we Had a break-in last night.

149
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,670
They took our drives,

150
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:51,550
Industrial espionage for sure.

151
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,250
A lot of money in the ai.

152
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:54,570
A lot of money.

153
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:56,820
Aren't you worried they
got Your software know,

154
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,400
pass it Off as their own.

155
00:08:58,470 --> 00:08:59,290
No.

156
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:01,940
My son built security measures Into the code.

157
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,260
Anyone tries to use the system

158
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:04,400
It will attack.

159
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,880
Is that why the airforce Wants it.

160
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,630
The airforce has been Interested in

161
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,520
ai applications For a long time now,

162
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,990
as par Back as the '80s.

163
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,860
Strange that you call the '80s far back.

164
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,030
I know,isn't it.

165
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,110
Are you a music fan?

166
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,990
That's how I mark the decade.

167
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,960
Always will be duran, duran.

168
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,990
I loved duran, duran.

169
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,030
Used to go dancing.

170
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:26,410
I miss dancing.

171
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,510
We would dress up.

172
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,910
Big hair.

173
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,080
it's the hardest thing to get right

174
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,240
-Hair
-Right.

175
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:40,380
So, the airforce?

176
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,320
Spreading money all over.

177
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:45,760
Rnd, industry cofinancing, Prizes.

178
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:46,880
I call her emma.

179
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,570
Ai, her name is emma.

180
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,210
Like my mom.

181
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,210
You never knew her.

182
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,470
She died in a car crash in 1984.

183
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:04,250
Coffee always helps me Think better. You?

184
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,520
Always.

185
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,320
Do you like chess?

186
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:20,400
I don't pretend to know what
goes on in that big Brain.

187
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:23,390
Operates in rounds that
you And I can't imagine.

188
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,460
He just has trouble with this One.

189
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,530
Needs you.

190
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,630
I bet sometimes it feels like He always will.

191
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:33,520
Do you have any kids.

192
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,410
Just one. Just my son.

193
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,080
Also challenging.

194
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,200
Yeah.

195
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:40,710
In his own way.

196
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,620
Well, then you get it.

197
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,670
Do anything for our kids.

198
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,480
Throw our lives out the window If we had to.

199
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,210
Tell me what you need.

200
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,160
Last night I would have

201
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,520
Said $100,000 and a little Patience.

202
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:56,840
This morning,

203
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,440
I need ten times That and a miracle.

204
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,670
A hell of a morning.

205
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,420
Design is so good.

206
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:06,840
How much time do you have?

207
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,440
Two weeks.

208
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,900
You need more than I have.

209
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:13,130
Call me alex.

210
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,860
Sorry, alex.

211
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:16,670
I'm sorry, too ms. gail.

212
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,850
Call me sarah.

213
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,280
Hi. I'm looking for riley.

214
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,470
Yeah, sure.

215
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,550
You must be john.

216
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,660
Hey, this is john.

217
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,630
Hi.

218
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,420
John, come in.

219
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:35,580
Riley's upstairs.

220
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:41,910
So your foster parents.

221
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,630
Not really what I imagined.

222
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,430
Yeah, they are nice.

223
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,320
They are too nice.

224
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,540
They are aliens.

225
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,410
See those kids down there.

226
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:53,250
They are not theirs.

227
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:56,420
They are just losers and

228
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,130
cast offs and rejects.

229
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,500
They run a loser camp here.

230
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,860
So what about my posters?

231
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,230
What's your favourite?

232
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,000
Ah, I don't know.

233
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,470
I went here so many.

234
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,210
I have been there with my mom.

235
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,180
What about you?

236
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,320
I'm going to guess the bear.

237
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:28,610
You seem like a good merit person.

238
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,860
Not a poster of a bear.

239
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,020
It's a poster of a fish
being Caught by a bear.

240
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,570
Swiped out of the water

241
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,670
Totally random.

242
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,970
Do the other fish even care?

243
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,050
Do they even notice?

244
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,250
No.

245
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,390
They just keep swimming
like nothing happened.

246
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:57,060
Nothing important did.

247
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,110
You know what, I think I'm going to go.

248
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,640
No.

249
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,270
No.

250
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,820
Stay.

251
00:13:09,930 --> 00:13:10,620
I mean,

252
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,750
you came here for a reason, right.

253
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,580
Stay.

254
00:13:24,510 --> 00:13:25,910
Back in mexico,

255
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,500
I promised to explain everything.

256
00:13:32,650 --> 00:13:33,510
The truth.

257
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:39,520
But the truth is there
is nothing I can explain.

258
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,390
Nothing I can say.

259
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,160
You don't have to say anything, john.

260
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,220
It's okay.

261
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,150
You can just sit here with me.

262
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,130
I would like that.

263
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,850
Sorry.

264
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,470
Okay, we got three dots, ai with a name.

265
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:15,660
Strong sense of self-preservation.

266
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,500
Plus the united states Airforce.

267
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,740
What does this add up to for You?

268
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:20,890
Not the turk.

269
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:23,170
Sandra doesn't play chess.

270
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,990
He prefers go.

271
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,360
It's a game.

272
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,140
Chinese invented it 5,000 Years ago.

273
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:34,150
Sandra said it has been calculated there more

274
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,830
Possible go games

275
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,390
In the all-atoms in the universe.

276
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,990
He offered to teach me how to play.

277
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,100
Did he offer to tell you about his ai?

278
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:45,080
It's not the turk.

279
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,080
I told you Sandra doesn't play Chess.

280
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,330
Can be a piece of the Puzzle.

281
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,520
We have seen that before.

282
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,250
Strange things happen at the one, two point.

283
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,680
It's go proverb.

284
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,150
Means the usual rules don't always apply.

285
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,290
Always the same rules. They always apply.

286
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,260
The car has no money.

287
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,210
Without this the airforce deadline.

288
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,660
They will find the money.

289
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:12,980
Everything they need.

290
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,040
Every penny.

291
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,250
They will get their miracle.

292
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,440
How do you know?

293
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,330
I know because it's written

294
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,740
In blood on my basement wall.

295
00:15:38,670 --> 00:15:39,570
Cute top.

296
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,490
You wanted to talk.

297
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,100
You look tired.

298
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,460
Are you sleeping enough?

299
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:55,390
He came to visit me today.

300
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,760
And I thought he was going to

301
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,850
Tell me everything.

302
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,770
I think that's what he wanted To do.

303
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:07,940
And then nothing happened.

304
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,260
He just left.

305
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,590
Something's wrong.

306
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,840
Off balance.

307
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:16,930
Steady him.

308
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:18,170
He is reaching out.

309
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,430
He ran away from me.

310
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,730
He is a boy.

311
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,260
A lot of mirrors in this Room.

312
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,410
Did you notice that?

313
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,260
I don't think I can do this Anymore.

314
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:47,210
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,770
It's not easy, I understand.

316
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,800
Maybe you even have some
real Feelings for him.

317
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,420
You wouldn't. He is john connor.

318
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,220
A reason people follow him all over hell.

319
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,230
What if I want out?

320
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,020
How would you do that?

321
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,510
Where would you go?

322
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,670
There is no out.

323
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:15,820
You can do this.

324
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,120
You have to do this.

325
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,950
Take a look at this.

326
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,730
Do you see him?

327
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:39,310
The three dots on the belt.

328
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,840
If you are going to talk about my mother

329
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,330
when she is Not even here.

330
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,670
I'm talking about the
three Dots on this belt.

331
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,740
I'm seeing them everywhere Now.

332
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,530
Got me thinking how crazy this can make you.

333
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,760
You start seeing things in Every corner

334
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,010
and on every Wall.

335
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,270
Pretty soon you forget what it

336
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,050
Was you were looking for in The first place.

337
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,610
All of us, every one.

338
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:06,880
I remember. I always Remember.

339
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,750
Do you?

340
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,570
Are you sure?

341
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,270
Derrick, what the hell?

342
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:15,910
Nothing.

343
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,050
I just need to know that
you Are seeing clearly.

344
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:27,340
I need to know someone
is, but Especially you.

345
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,930
How old did you say your Son was?

346
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,470
I didn't, but he is 16.

347
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,900
Had our kids about the same Age.

348
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,480
Had mine when I was 21.

349
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,260
You?

350
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,060
19.

351
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,070
My wife, emma, was 19 when we First met.

352
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:54,830
The debut performance of pink Floyd the wall,

353
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,590
daily memorial Sports arena.

354
00:18:57,090 --> 00:18:58,080
I remember that.

355
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:00,510
I wanted to see it so bad.

356
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:03,900
That was 1980, so you Were ...

357
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,640
Nine?

358
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,430
I was very young.

359
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:10,960
This morning I told you i Needed a miracle.

360
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,820
Did you get it.

361
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:15,470
Do you remember the chess Tournament,

362
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,450
airforce sponsored A couple of months ago.

363
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:19,580
A friend of a friend works for A company

364
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,830
that sponsored the Winners, the japanese.

365
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,430
They have a chip prototype.

366
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,580
Chip.

367
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,050
It's a super computer.

368
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,170
Small enough to fit on
the end Of your finger.

369
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:36,160
They want to license it to us.

370
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,300
We quietly put it through its Paces,

371
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,820
and they get a real World test,

372
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,090
and if it works,

373
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,040
We are all geniuses.

374
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,550
Very rich geniuses.

375
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,000
What do you need for this Chip?

376
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,120
A deposit.

377
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:53,220
Japanese friends are very risk Averse.

378
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:55,970
They want half a million to

379
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:57,800
Demonstrate seriousness.

380
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:59,230
You think it works.

381
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,430
This chip?

382
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:01,590
It's the future.

383
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,640
I have been in warmer morgues.

384
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,030
Got to keep the temperature not to go frozen

385
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,520
Towers would fry.

386
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,140
Computer is like everything Else.

387
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,530
Power it generates heat,

388
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,640
Requires cooling, needs more Power.

389
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,320
You know Babylon is a kind of a pig.

390
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,000
Babylon.

391
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,790
You know the story£¿

392
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:30,120
I minored in beer bang Engineering.

393
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:31,930
I didn't read a lot of Stories.

394
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,530
It was a marvel.

395
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,710
God destroyed it.

396
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,910
God have gave it a shot yesterday.

397
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,710
The blackout should have
shut it down completely.

398
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,840
Should it

399
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,340
Babylon routed every watt

400
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,260
From the generates to keep Itself running.

401
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,540
It broke the rules.

402
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,880
It invented new ones.

403
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,870
Mr Waiver said dr. sherman

404
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,150
Worked on the ...

405
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,170
Yeah.

406
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:57,440
Touchy feely, BS, if you Ask me.

407
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,520
How did it feel about him?

408
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,750
Sorry?

409
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,510
Babylon.

410
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,160
How did it feel about Dr. sherman?

411
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,660
I know how that sounds.

412
00:21:07,730 --> 00:21:09,140
It's a computer.

413
00:21:09,710 --> 00:21:11,970
I mean, how does a coffee
Maker feel about coffee?

414
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,660
You heard me.

415
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,570
You are asking if I knew
It was killing sherman

416
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,920
when it threw the switch?

417
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,850
Impossible.

418
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,620
Help.

419
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,800
It's not enough.

420
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,120
What would be enough?

421
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,950
Everything.

422
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,130
Everything then.

423
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,600
You are certain?

424
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,360
Certain as --
is a luxury.

425
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,060
The rules do not apply.

426
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,870
I guess it's enough.

427
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,600
Are you okay?

428
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,700
I'm still patient

429
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,680
Big prolong.

430
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,530
You have to use the full range

431
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,690
Of tools on a guy like him

432
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,800
Before you can close.

433
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,540
You are lucky you and your

434
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,050
Tech pair aren't as tight.

435
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:20,940
You are kidding?

436
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,660
A little bit.

437
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,590
Are you sure you want to do This in cash?

438
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,630
I don't like banks.

439
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,890
Return the toast, proper Etiquette.

440
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,850
Used to think that it was Impossible.

441
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,150
Circuits are so tiny you are

442
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:03,990
All but in the quantum realm.

443
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:07,540
It's the most sophisticated Process on earth.

444
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,450
If you could take your Memories,

445
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:11,430
your consciousness,

446
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:13,900
Everything that makes you a Person,

447
00:23:13,970 --> 00:23:15,430
turn it into pure data

448
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,570
And download it on to a Machine.

449
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,610
That you could run it.

450
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,130
Are you going to eat that?

451
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,870
America.

452
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,500
I love it here.

453
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:28,770
No pressure.

454
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,350
No expectations.

455
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,710
Good sucker

456
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,180
So how long do you estimate

457
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:37,510
Before we stop screwing around Here

458
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,070
and you hand over the Chip?

459
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,210
Pleasure to do business With you.

460
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,990
Don't worry.

461
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,590
Didn't know you spoke Japanese.

462
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,830
I was into stix before Duran, duran.

463
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,580
My turn.

464
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,880
No, it's not, it's my turn.

465
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:34,210
Whatever. It's my turn.

466
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:36,070
Hand me the remote.

467
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,890
You missed dinner again.

468
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,300
Leftovers are in the Fridge.

469
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,220
All right.

470
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,210
Give it back.

471
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,000
The remote.

472
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,950
You took it, and I know you Did.

473
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,870
Riley saw.

474
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,080
I did not, you lier.

475
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,060
I'm going to tell mom.

476
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,420
Tell mom what?

477
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,210
Gina took the remote.

478
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:57,470
And she wants to watch.

479
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:58,940
I know you are upset.

480
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,760
We don't use those words in This house.

481
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,610
She started and riley saw.

482
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,900
Crazy.

483
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:04,810
What.

484
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:07,350
I said he is crazy.

485
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,480
You are all crazy.

486
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,000
Everyone of you.

487
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:15,160
Just sit here in your cozy Little house

488
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,950
with your cold Sewgas --
sodas and facebook Pages

489
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,290
like it matters.

490
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,590
Like it's real but it's not.

491
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:22,920
It's going to burn

492
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,090
and you Will be nothing but skulls.

493
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,740
Don't you get it.

494
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,310
You are dead.

495
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,310
All of you are dead.

496
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,550
Honey.

497
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:36,870
I'm sorry.

498
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,140
I'm sorry.

499
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,460
Thank you.

500
00:25:52,370 --> 00:25:53,130
Look at them.

501
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,260
So many dreams.

502
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,220
About to burn those dreams to The ground.

503
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,930
Connections are up.

504
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,480
Drawing full power.

505
00:26:14,430 --> 00:26:15,570
Loading the program.

506
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,690
What's going on?

507
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,840
Processor register error in The cp memory.

508
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,730
I'm sure it's just a Hiccup.

509
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,950
The data,

510
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,880
a post stamp on a Pool table.

511
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,280
Trying to push a watermelon
Through a garden hose.

512
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,850
our enemy is not 12.

513
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:07,650
This chip is not digned

514
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,090
This guy appears more advanced.

515
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,720
they screwed us.

516
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,070
My family used to run a

517
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:30,020
dry Goods store

518
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,190
for the second World war.

519
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,780
After pearl harbour

520
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:37,260
when they Were getting
rounded up for internment

521
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,440
neighbours offered to watch
our home and business For us.

522
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,060
Just sign this little piece of Paper.

523
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,270
What grandpa didn't know

524
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:52,430
While his son was fighting Across italy 442nd

525
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:56,510
the Neighbours were getting the

526
00:27:56,510 --> 00:27:59,000
Property condemned and
deeding It to themselves.

527
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:03,600
You couldn't have known.

528
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,710
I will fix it.

529
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,090
Make it right.

530
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,240
I don't know how long it will Take

531
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,380
but I will pay you back Every dime.

532
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,860
This isn't important right Now.

533
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,370
I will talk to him.

534
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,080
You don't just talk to Someone like him.

535
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:34,190
It is old country.

536
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:37,340
You know what it is.

537
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,010
A gangster.

538
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,310
You hit him, he will hit You back.

539
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,130
Only he will hit you back Tenfold.

540
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,640
He will mail what's left of You

541
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,940
to your son one piece at a Time cod.

542
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,500
And you trusted him.

543
00:28:49,750 --> 00:28:51,760
Most of these guys mobbed Up.

544
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,310
You didn't buy that chip.

545
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,980
You were paying him to steal It.

546
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,200
Now we know all the facts.

547
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,750
Means, opportunity, but Intent.

548
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,180
we can only guess.

549
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,970
Why did you ask him?

550
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:22,350
Ask the babylon ai, ask john Henry.

551
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:25,680
John henry.

552
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,690
It has a name.

553
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,720
Something dr. sherman did.

554
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,470
Gave it that name.

555
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,640
Not a person.

556
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,940
No.

557
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,140
But it's a mind.

558
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,240
talk to john Henry.

559
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,520
Communicates through images,

560
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,140
Symbol responses,

561
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:48,360
thought About using a
natural language Interface,

562
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,550
but decided against It.

563
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,180
Too creepy.

564
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,460
But it does voice recognition.

565
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,370
Just talk to him.

566
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:59,570
John henry, I'm James Ellison.

567
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,160
Okay.

568
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,600
You know who I am.

569
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,180
Good.

570
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:12,220
Do you know dr. boyd sherman?

571
00:30:16,050 --> 00:30:17,930
That's a yes.

572
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,620
One is yes. Zero is no.

573
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,680
Did you work with him Yesterday?

574
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,010
Did you work with him today?

575
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,390
Why is that?

576
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:34,960
No operator.

577
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,590
No operation.

578
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,280
Could mean dead.

579
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,170
Could be waiting for input.

580
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,240
Rephrase it.

581
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,280
Show me what happened to Dr. sherman.

582
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,560
He was in the lab when the Power went out.

583
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,010
Biometrics showed normal.

584
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,880
Generators came on line.

585
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,930
Power went to the server Farms.

586
00:30:57,470 --> 00:30:58,880
Dr. sherman tried to leave

587
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:00,870
but The electronic door failed.

588
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,050
His pulse increased.

589
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,330
There was only enough power
to run and cool the servers.

590
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,960
Security and biometric
Monitoring went off line.

591
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,030

00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:16,410

00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:22,650
His heart had stopped.

595
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:25,260
His body temperature had risen To the room

596
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:27,810
to almost double Standard temperatures.

597
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:30,610
Well above human Survivorability levels.

598
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,070
He was dead.

599
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,190
But john henry says medical
attention require it.

600
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,400

But you called the paramedics.

603
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,880
You thought they could help?

604
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,690
Am I alive?

605
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,420
Am I dead?

606
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,700

608
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,920
John henry,

609
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,420
how did you Feel about dr. sherman?

610
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:10,360
Do you understand that

611
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,600
Redirecting the power to the Server farms

612
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,870
caused Dr. sherman to die?

613
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:20,010
What image do you associate
With that information?

614
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:25,010
John henry,

615
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,100

With that information?

616
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,750
Has no feeling for what it Did.

617
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,170
Has no opinion.

618
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,640
That's what I was telling you.

619
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,810
Sure, you taught it Procedures.

620
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,290
You taught it rules.

621
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,880
But it has got no ethics, no Morales.

622
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,320
Whether it had any feeling

623
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,440
About dr. sherman shouldn't Matter.

624
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,290
If you had taught it to value Sherman's life.

625
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,570
Someone killed a man.

626
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,800
And it wasn't john henry.

627
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,640

714
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,710

00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:55,480
I hired a man to sell to us.

716
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:59,190
We couldn't make the airforce Deadline, zan.

717
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,020

720
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,980
But it could work.

721
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,800
My design can work.

722
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,240
Daddy, I hope you are right. I do.

723
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,470
I have faith in you.

724
00:37:22,610 --> 00:37:25,950

725
00:37:26,030 --> 00:37:28,000

726
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:32,270
And I wonder if you understand Me.

727
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,330
The money is under my desk.

And it's just ...unlocked.

729
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,960

How not like you.

751
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:19,490
Sarcasm, how not like you.

752
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,540
Oh, wait, that's exactly like You.

753
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,280
I just wanted to stop by to

754
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,600
Let you know that I reject Your rejection.

755
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,520
You want to go for a walk?

756
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:38,700
Mom, I'm going out for A while.

757
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,410
I thought about what you Said, about rules.

758
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,150
The ten commandments.

759
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:42,230
I'm not qualified to teach
John henry those things.

760
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:44,490
I don't know how.

761
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,660
That's why dr. sherman was Here.

762
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,220
I want to show you something.

763
00:42:02,110 --> 00:42:03,110
In the folklore

764
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,990
John henry raced a
steam-drill through a moutain.

765
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,060
One man alone challenge the machine.

766
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,020
Armed with an iron hammer

767
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:12,710
Say he was born with it in his Hand.

768
00:42:13,350 --> 00:42:15,170
His heart gave out, he died, I know.

769
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,310
John henry defeated the Machine.

770
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,210
But he couldn't stop progress.

771
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:40,830
Hello, mr. ellis.

772
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:45,070
My name is john henry.

773
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,980
How are you today?
