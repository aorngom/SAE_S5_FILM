1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,066
In the future,

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:07,112
My son will lead mankind
in!A war against skynet...

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,472
a computer system programmed
to destroy the world.

4
00:00:12,166 --> 00:00:15,128
It has sent machines
back through time...

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,932
some to kill him,
one to protect him.

6
00:00:18,999 --> 00:00:22,767
Today we fight to stop skynet
from ever being created,

7
00:00:22,833 --> 00:00:24,862
To change our future,

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:27,487
To change his fate.

9
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:31,800
The war to save mankind begins now.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,500
???The sarah connor chronicles...

11
00:00:41,894 --> 00:00:42,566
cromartie came through.

12
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,166
He knows we're here.

13
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:45,899
It's just a head.

14
00:00:45,966 --> 00:00:48,050
We're programmed
to repair ourselves.

15
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:49,675
And to blend in.

16
00:00:51,733 --> 00:00:55,500
He will rebuild and continue
his mission to hunt and kill.

17
00:00:55,566 --> 00:00:56,862
I know what his mission is.

18
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:58,932
We've got a problem.

19
00:00:58,999 --> 00:01:00,867
Andy goode rebuilt
his chess computer.

20
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:01,878
The turk.

21
00:01:02,316 --> 00:01:04,166
Somebody killed him
and took the machine.

22
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:06,767
I was paid money for it, $20,000.

23
00:01:06,833 --> 00:01:07,800
Who bought the turk?

24
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:09,266
That's all i have.

25
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:13,066
These things, all of them, are
programmed with specific missions.

26
00:01:13,133 --> 00:01:14,700
The one at the safe house

27
00:01:14,767 --> 00:01:16,633
Was sent there for the
resistance fighters.

28
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,633
Humans sent back from
the future by john.

29
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:26,456
Everything needs to be
destroyed. Every last bolt.

30
00:01:26,456 --> 00:01:28,113
Even a single,
unaccounted for piece

31
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:30,362
Could hasten the
arrival of judgment day.

32
00:01:31,199 --> 00:01:32,133
Get it done.

33
00:01:32,199 --> 00:01:33,253
No sweat.

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:55,666
I need a list of new students inrict
who have enrolled since the fall of 2007.

35
00:01:55,733 --> 00:01:57,266
Males, caucasian,

36
00:01:57,333 --> 00:01:59,066
Ages 15 to 18.

37
00:01:59,133 --> 00:02:01,566
You boys are in here
at least twice a month

38
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:03,999
Waving your patriot act around.

39
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,519
Let me guess
- Drugs?

40
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:09,362
Look me in the eye and tell me

41
00:02:09,362 --> 00:02:12,400
You've never smoked
a little marijuana.

42
00:02:15,299 --> 00:02:17,600
I've never smoked
a little marijuana.

43
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:22,466
Hmm.

44
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,867
Okay, let's see your paperwork.

45
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:29,800
Court order or a signed
national security letter.

46
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:31,299
I don't have my paperwork.

47
00:02:31,366 --> 00:02:34,862
Sorry, the district
will not release

48
00:02:34,862 --> 00:02:37,366
Personal information on students

49
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:40,166
Without written
authorization from the-

50
00:02:46,032 --> 00:02:48,032
Thank you for your cooperation.

51
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:06,612
All of us wear masks.

52
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:09,333
They can be worn out of love

53
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,566
And the desire to remain
close to those around us,

54
00:03:12,633 --> 00:03:14,899
To spare them from
the complicated reality

55
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,666
Of our frayed psyches.

56
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,633
Mom, food's done.

57
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:21,433
It smells done.

58
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,899
We trade honesty for companionship.

59
00:03:23,966 --> 00:03:25,333
Mom, come on.

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,633
It's gonna get burned.

61
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,333
And in the process,

62
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
Never truly know the
hearts closest to us.

63
00:03:32,466 --> 00:03:34,500
Mr. Sarkissian, i'm calling again

64
00:03:34,566 --> 00:03:37,166
About the computer, the
one called "the turk."

65
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:38,733
Will you please call me back.

66
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:42,690


68
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,284
The roast should have
been removed from the stove

69
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:52,503
18 minutes?????

70
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,612
And it's fine.

71
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,050
All right.

72
00:04:00,466 --> 00:04:02,199
Not exactly fine.

73
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,867
Where'd you get this?

74
00:04:15,899 --> 00:04:17,032
Her room.

75
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,767
Why were you in my room?

76
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,175
You told me you
destroyed everything.

77
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:23,675
She lied.

78
00:04:24,633 --> 00:04:27,733
The chip contains visual
records of the t-Triple-Eight-

79
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,999
Where it's been, who
it's interacted with.

80
00:04:30,099 --> 00:04:31,733
It carries important information.

81
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:32,899
It's a brain.

82
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:35,932
It's the only truly irreplaceable
part and she kept it.

83
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:39,767
Next she's gonna tell us

84
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,566
That somehow that's gonna
help us find the turk.

85
00:04:41,633 --> 00:04:43,266
It won't help us find the turk.

86
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,533
What are you saying?

87
00:04:44,633 --> 00:04:45,932
What i'm saying is what
i've been saying, john.

88
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:47,133
She can't be trusted.

89
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,266
No matter how she
acts on the outside,

90
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,899
We have no idea what's
going on in!There.

91
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,533
Well, i could say that about you.

92
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,400
Who showed you to my safe house?

93
00:04:57,466 --> 00:04:58,800
She did.

94
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,800
Who else knew about it? Nobody.

95
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:03,166
Where are my men?

96
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,550
In the morgue.

97
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:11,233
I didn't give the triple-Eight
the safe house location.

98
00:05:11,299 --> 00:05:13,238
Prove it.

99
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,867
Have you ever hacked one of those?

100
00:05:16,932 --> 00:05:18,333
Have you ever read what's on it?

101
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,333
No.

102
00:05:20,253 --> 00:05:20,966
But you have.

103
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:31,833
So how often do you lie?

104
00:05:33,932 --> 00:05:35,867
When the mission requires it.

105
00:05:36,503 --> 00:05:38,032
Do you lie to me?

106
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:39,966
Sometimes.

107
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,666
About important things?

108
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:45,300
Yes.

109
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:47,533
Important things.

110
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:52,032
All right, bro.

111
00:05:52,099 --> 00:05:54,299
This is what i'm talking about.

112
00:05:54,366 --> 00:05:55,333
You can't get these kind of goods

113
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,500
Unless you got family in korea.

114
00:05:56,566 --> 00:05:59,199
Dual-Core processor,
brand-New system bus,

115
00:05:59,266 --> 00:06:00,878
Overclocked memory.

116
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,700
They're using it for the effects
in the new dark man series.

117
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:04,867
Wow.

118
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:06,133
What's the video throughput?

119
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,400
1.4 terabytes per second.

120
00:06:08,466 --> 00:06:10,800
Mas macho, brother.

121
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,966
I'm gonna need two.

122
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:14,566
Cool.

123
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:20,675
Am i making a mistake
with this chip thing?

124
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:23,362
Do i wanna see what's on it?

125
00:06:25,347 --> 00:06:25,999
Tell me "no."

126
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:28,379
I'd rather tell you after.

127
00:06:30,566 --> 00:06:32,800
Flick those bastards off the jeep.

128
00:06:38,644 --> 00:06:39,932
Look, since you
obviously have no clue

129
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,233
How to read this garbage,

130
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:43,233
Would you mind making a
7-Eleven run or something?

131
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:46,233
Pick up some burritos,
chocolate milk.

132
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:48,206
It'd mean a lot to me.

133
00:06:58,487 --> 00:07:00,233
How much power are
you giving the chip?

134
00:07:00,299 --> 00:07:02,066
Uh...

135
00:07:03,899 --> 00:07:06,333
we are running at 2.5 volts.

136
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,199
My cpu requires a minimum of 6.2

137
00:07:08,266 --> 00:07:10,433
And a maximum of 8.7
continuous voltage

138
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,099
In order to function properly.

139
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,466
Well, that much use would burn out

140
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,133
Any processor i've ever seen.

141
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,400
Access to visual memory
will require less power

142
00:07:17,466 --> 00:07:18,932
Than higher level functions.

143
00:07:19,722 --> 00:07:20,999
Higher level functions.

144
00:07:20,999 --> 00:07:22,266
Decision making.

145
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,633
Strategic mission analysis.

146
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,400
We don't wanna activate
those functions.

147
00:07:25,466 --> 00:07:27,733
So crank the juice
but not too much?

148
00:07:28,238 --> 00:07:29,600
Yes.

149
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,433
Crank the juice.

150
00:07:39,966 --> 00:07:41,733
Wow. What a mess.

151
00:07:45,466 --> 00:07:46,999
How the hell do you keep
your brain organized?

152
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:47,999
Not like yours.

153
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:49,666
No kidding.

154
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:09,032
Vick, god, you poor thing.?????

155
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:11,500
I told you, just
take one of my pills.

156
00:08:11,566 --> 00:08:13,999
Fine, babe, come back to bed.

157
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:17,299
I can't sleep with you
standing there like a statue.

158
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,433
Was that thing...

159
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,400
married?

160
00:08:30,466 --> 00:08:31,733
The
t-Triple-Eight

161
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,433
Is an advanced model infiltrator.

162
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,128
Yeah, but i don't think she knows.

163
00:08:36,128 --> 00:08:37,800
I mean, is that possible?

164
00:08:38,253 --> 00:08:40,633
She would not be the first
human fooled by a machine.

165
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,800
I know i've been working a lot.

166
00:08:56,867 --> 00:08:59,067
And i know it's been hard for you

167
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,378
Hanging around at home
since your car accident.

168
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:03,503
I thought we'd made progress.

169
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:08,050
Just talk to me, sweetie.

170
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:11,253
Don't keep it inside. Please.

171
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,667
Please.

172
00:09:40,034 --> 00:09:42,753
At least now we have
an address to go to.

173
00:09:43,367 --> 00:09:45,567
That chip is really creepy.

174
00:09:45,634 --> 00:09:48,233
We've seen some creepy things.

175
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,333
He's protecting her.

176
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,934
Why?

177
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:53,159
And why like that?

178
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,734
Because they're
twisted. That's why.

179
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,613
I'll be in the jeep.

180
00:10:04,367 --> 00:10:05,925
She didn't do it.

181
00:10:06,925 --> 00:10:08,300
She didn't give up the safe house.

182
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:09,400
She's not like that other one.

183
00:10:09,467 --> 00:10:10,900
I hope not.

184
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,487
Have fun at school.

185
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,999
It's pizza day.

186
00:10:19,867 --> 00:10:21,316
I read the newsletter.

187
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,433
Isn't pizza day tomorrow?

188
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,925
Yeah/

189
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,834
She hasn't been here for a while.

190
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,363
I wonder what she thinks
happened to her husband.

191
00:10:40,001 --> 00:10:40,847
Are you kidding?

192
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:43,237
She's dead.

193
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,956
We don't know that.

194
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,300
He wasn't holding her captive.

195
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,440
He wasn't intimidating her.

196
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:57,456
They lived here together.

197
00:11:01,034 --> 00:11:02,425
You think you'd know?

198
00:11:03,734 --> 00:11:05,425
I know i'd know.

199
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:16,863
Computer's gone.

200
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:20,238
Triple-Eight probably jumped
it to cover his tracks.

201
00:11:24,101 --> 00:11:26,581
"Barbara chamberlain,
city manager, los angeles."

202
00:11:28,034 --> 00:11:30,200
City manager, that's
infrastructure.

203
00:11:30,266 --> 00:11:32,113
No wonder skynet's interested.

204
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,581
You think this woman has
anything to do with the turk?

205
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,410
Well, i think if skynet's
interested, we're interested.

206
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:40,634
Do you not wanna work on this?

207
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,628
Because i do.

208
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:43,472
I want us to be happy.

209
00:11:44,433 --> 00:11:45,362
I've made a decision-

210
00:11:45,867 --> 00:11:47,237
We're gonna figure
out what we want.

211
00:11:48,101 --> 00:11:49,238
Together.

212
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:50,925
I'm quitting my job. I'm-

213
00:11:51,934 --> 00:11:52,910
I'm coming home.

214
00:11:56,433 --> 00:11:57,988
That's not a good idea, babe.

215
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,222
See it?

216
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,767
I got it crowd surfing

217
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:13,067
During bjork's secret show

218
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:14,566
At the echo last october.

219
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:17,734
Man, it was the best
five seconds of my life,

220
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,050
I swear to god.

221
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,987
But i got dropped on a chair.

222
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,441
I consider it my first tattoo.

223
00:12:24,175 --> 00:12:25,863
That's tight.

224
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:39,800
Hey, sherry.

225
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,667
Uh, i was thinking
maybe we could use

226
00:12:41,734 --> 00:12:44,222
Study hall to get ready
for the chem test tomorrow.

227
00:12:44,222 --> 00:12:45,867
Yeah. Sure.

228
00:12:45,934 --> 00:12:47,101
That'd be great.

229
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,347
So i hear we used to
be midwest neighbors.

230
00:12:51,347 --> 00:12:51,878
What?

231
00:12:52,378 --> 00:12:54,634
You know, i'm from
lawrence in kansas.

232
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,133
And i overheard you
were from wichita.

233
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,101
So we're practically
cousins geographically-

234
00:12:58,166 --> 00:12:59,634
Who told you i was from wichita?

235
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:01,050
I don't remember.

236
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,972
I'm not.

237
00:13:03,001 --> 00:13:04,500
Whoever said it heard wrong.

238
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:05,612
Okay.

239
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,667
See you in study hall?

240
00:13:09,734 --> 00:13:10,300
Yeah.

241
00:13:11,034 --> 00:13:11,878
Great.

242
00:13:19,667 --> 00:13:21,634
Way to go,!Johnson.

243
00:13:25,133 --> 00:13:27,500
I need to speak to eric carlson.

244
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,533
He in some sort of trouble?

245
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,300
No, no trouble. Where is he?

246
00:13:31,367 --> 00:13:32,567
He just got outta gym class.

247
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:33,767
Give him five to finish showering.

248
00:13:33,834 --> 00:13:36,034
Eric carlson?

249
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:37,166
Hey!

250
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,700
Eric carlson?

251
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,967
What seems to be the problem, sir?

252
00:13:51,967 --> 00:13:52,900
Hey!

253
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:54,600
Are you for real, buddy?

254
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,675
You think i can't get you fired

255
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,191
For that little peep show?

256
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:00,999
Coach!

257
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:12,675
I just finished going through

258
00:14:12,675 --> 00:14:15,144
The first set of files you grabbed.

259
00:14:15,967 --> 00:14:18,425
Only understood a
third of what i read.

260
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,894
You've been doing that
for 20 minutes now.

261
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,767
With my toothbrush.

262
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,159
I got you your own.

263
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,999
And now it's mine.

264
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,987
Mom.

265
00:14:53,834 --> 00:14:55,834
So i figured out that they don't

266
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,097
Store memories the way we do.

267
00:14:57,097 --> 00:14:58,941
They store them by categories.

268
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,737
Like, mission or
location or whatever.

269
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,331
How did you figure that out?

270
00:15:03,331 --> 00:15:05,266
Remember those weird robot symbols?

271
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,600
I still don't know
how to read them.

272
00:15:06,667 --> 00:15:08,600
But the exact same
one kept popping up

273
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:10,722
Every time a clip of
barbara was playing.

274
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:12,863
You should look at this.

275
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,233
Stop. Please.

276
00:15:35,034 --> 00:15:36,768
He gained her trust.

277
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,753
Made her think he was human.

278
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,488
Then killed her.

279
00:15:41,675 --> 00:15:43,160
That's what they do.

280
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,967
John, get the flashlights.
We're gonna find her.

281
00:15:54,967 --> 00:15:56,333
Finding barbara's body

282
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,001
Should not be a mission priority.

283
00:15:58,067 --> 00:15:59,433
You're right.

284
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,800
But we're gonna do it anyway.

285
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,863
We're here.

286
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,237
You see anything?

287
00:16:41,899 --> 00:16:43,238
No.

288
00:16:45,799 --> 00:16:47,966
I don't understand
your need to find her.

289
00:16:48,033 --> 00:16:48,159
She's dead.

290
00:16:50,133 --> 00:16:52,533
That's because you
don't value human life.

291
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,925
But she's not life.
She's just a body.

292
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,333
Bones and meat.

293
00:16:59,033 --> 00:17:00,433
Was that bad to say?

294
00:17:08,706 --> 00:17:13,133
So do we do this a
lot in the future,

295
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,488
Sneak around in the dark?

296
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:16,133
We do this a lot.

297
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:27,050
I was kinda hoping
we wouldn't find her.

298
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,300
That's not barbara.

299
00:17:57,466 --> 00:17:59,400
Who the hell's jessica peck?

300
00:17:59,466 --> 00:18:01,363
A threat to skynet.

301
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,222
Well, how did she get in there

302
00:18:04,222 --> 00:18:06,097
To meet with the city
council without us knowing?

303
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,066
I can't be everywhere. I can't.

304
00:18:10,133 --> 00:18:12,066
I'm working from home
because i just have

305
00:18:12,133 --> 00:18:13,999
Some family stuff
i need to deal with.

306
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:16,488
I have to go.

307
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,333
Jessica peck's trying to
shut down my program again.

308
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,199
Jessica peck was a lobbyist

309
00:18:28,266 --> 00:18:30,400
Being paid to oppose artie.

310
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:30,862
Who's artie?

311
00:18:30,862 --> 00:18:34,675
Automated real time traffic
information exchange.

312
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,737
It was one of barbara
chamberlain's pet projects.

313
00:18:37,737 --> 00:18:40,600
I think it's one of
skynet's pet projects.

314
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,633
So this is about traffic lights?

315
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,767
Exactly.

316
00:18:43,767 --> 00:18:44,832
It's a fiber optic network

317
00:18:44,899 --> 00:18:46,300
Linking every street intersection

318
00:18:46,366 --> 00:18:47,799
To a data center in city hall.

319
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:50,066
Camera's, microphones, sensors.

320
00:18:50,133 --> 00:18:51,600
Right now it's only
a pilot program,

321
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,033
But it could grow statewide.

322
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:53,862
Traffic.

323
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,600
It's not about traffic.

324
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:56,707
It's about information.

325
00:18:56,707 --> 00:18:58,466
Eyes and ears everywhere.

326
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,066
A system that can watch you,

327
00:19:00,133 --> 00:19:01,425
Track you everywhere you go.

328
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,466
If the turk is destined
to become skynet's brain,

329
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:06,633
This software could
be its nervous system.

330
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,987
Like a body waiting for its head.

331
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:09,612
And we don't have either one.

332
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,099
Well, i guess when they say,
"you can't fight city hall"

333
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:13,300
They really mean it.

334
00:19:13,366 --> 00:19:14,533
Yeah, well, whoever said that

335
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,333
Doesn't have as much
plastique as we do.

336
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,033
We can't blow up city hall.

337
00:19:18,099 --> 00:19:19,433
It's really not that hard.

338
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,099
If we destroy the program,
they'll just rebuild it.

339
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:25,266
But if we plant a
virus and crash it,

340
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:27,238
Maybe they'll think it's a bust.

341
00:19:27,932 --> 00:19:29,700
It's already a
controversial program.

342
00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,233
Can you make the virus?

343
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,866
Sure, but city hall's computers

344
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:34,050
Aren't accessible from the outside.

345
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,175
Just make me the virus.
I'll get it inside.

346
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,050
Getting through
security won't be easy.

347
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,667
Once we're inside,
there'll be more guards,

348
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:49,737
Cameras.

349
00:19:50,832 --> 00:19:52,166
What can i get for you?

350
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,033
Just an iced tea, thanks.

351
00:19:54,099 --> 00:19:55,082
Uh, a beer.??

352
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,550
Thank you.

353
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:01,488
I used to be her.

354
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:04,266
Huh?

355
00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:06,366
The waitress. I used
to work in a diner.

356
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,113
I can't see that at all.

357
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,667
I had this regular, tracy.

358
00:20:13,667 --> 00:20:16,999
She had two beautiful kids.

359
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,866
She left her husband,
moved her kids to l.A.

360
00:20:19,932 --> 00:20:21,769
To get 'em into show business.

361
00:20:23,566 --> 00:20:25,362
I'd bring her eggs every day.

362
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:29,253
And i'd hear what she said to them.

363
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:33,066
That they had bad
skin or crooked teeth.

364
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,488
One lie after another.

365
00:20:37,488 --> 00:20:40,566
I swear sometimes i understand
why they drop bombs on us.

366
00:20:53,832 --> 00:20:55,533
Don't worry about it.

367
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,466
We're not going in the front door.

368
00:20:58,175 --> 00:20:59,700
These buildings are all connected

369
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:01,700
By a series of underground tunnels

370
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:03,675
That were built
during the cold war.

371
00:21:04,033 --> 00:21:06,799
I did a project on
'em in the ninth grade.

372
00:21:06,866 --> 00:21:08,112
My last year at school.

373
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,633
And how do you know
they're still functional?

374
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,767
I lived there,

375
00:21:15,832 --> 00:21:16,612
Kyle and i.

376
00:21:18,199 --> 00:21:20,233
After they dropped the bombs on us.

377
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:29,925
Cameron.

378
00:21:31,066 --> 00:21:32,144
Cameron baum.

379
00:21:32,966 --> 00:21:33,675
Yes.

380
00:21:34,733 --> 00:21:36,113
Uh, happy pizza day.

381
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,400
Thank you. I had two slices.

382
00:21:39,466 --> 00:21:40,784
Do i look fat?

383
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,366
Um, still good.

384
00:21:43,433 --> 00:21:45,466
So i had a little issue last week

385
00:21:45,533 --> 00:21:48,899
With a banned substance
in the student parking lot.

386
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:51,633
And now, as a condition
of my rehabilitation,

387
00:21:52,613 --> 00:21:54,050
I hand these out to people.

388
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,700
There's a cop in the
principal's office.

389
00:21:57,767 --> 00:21:59,238
He wants to talk to your brother.

390
00:22:00,832 --> 00:22:01,999
Uh...

391
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:03,879
is he hiding?

392
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,066
Does he have stuff in his locker?

393
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:08,988
Wait, he's not a narc is he?

394
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,175
I'll make sure john gets this.

395
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,754
I need you.

396
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:02,600
You wanted to see me?

397
00:23:03,175 --> 00:23:04,112
John baum?

398
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,550
Yes, sir.

399
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,734
Thank you for your time.

400
00:23:24,567 --> 00:23:25,600
Cameron.

401
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:29,925
What are you doing?

402
00:23:32,867 --> 00:23:34,394
Never mind.

403
00:23:38,967 --> 00:23:40,033
Okay.

404
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,233
I have no clue what
happened to you in kansas.

405
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,867
But your sister's a genius,

406
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:45,901
And i've got nerves of steel.

407
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:46,472
Huh?

408
00:23:46,999 --> 00:23:48,634
We got that cop off your back,

409
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,700
And i've never felt mose alive.

410
00:23:51,315 --> 00:23:52,734
What cop?

411
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,300
Oh...

412
00:24:01,901 --> 00:24:03,367
i don't think i can do it.

413
00:24:03,433 --> 00:24:05,112
I can't finish.

414
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:07,659
But you've almost completed it.

415
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,400
But if i do, i just-

416
00:24:10,467 --> 00:24:12,567
I feel like it's become
a monster, you know?

417
00:24:12,634 --> 00:24:14,467
It's become a horrible
thing between us.

418
00:24:14,534 --> 00:24:16,634
And ever since i
started working on it,

419
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,050
You've been so-

420
00:24:18,634 --> 00:24:19,987
I don't mean to blame you.

421
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,612
Finish it.

422
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,634
Finish it.

423
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,519
You scared the hell outta me.

424
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,600
How long you been sitting there?

425
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:55,628
A little while.

426
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:00,834
That was effective.

427
00:25:01,316 --> 00:25:02,613
What he did,

428
00:25:03,999 --> 00:25:05,565
When he touched her lips.

429
00:25:06,001 --> 00:25:06,863
Effective?

430
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,925
I could see that she liked that.

431
00:25:09,972 --> 00:25:10,988
What are you doing?

432
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:15,863
No.

433
00:25:17,001 --> 00:25:18,934
When you say things like that,

434
00:25:19,001 --> 00:25:20,500
What are you doing?

435
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Just making conversation.

436
00:25:22,567 --> 00:25:24,534
Since when do you
just make conversation?

437
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,565
I don't know.

438
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:27,634
I just seems like
something i should do.

439
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:32,734
And was having morris
impersonate me with that cop

440
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,166
Also something you
thought you should do,

441
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,175
No matter what happened to him?

442
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,834
Yes.

443
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:41,362
But it wasn't a cop.
It was cromartie.

444
00:25:42,175 --> 00:25:42,894
What?

445
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:48,100
W
- What?

446
00:25:48,166 --> 00:25:50,367
He's going school to
school looking for you.

447
00:25:50,999 --> 00:25:52,700
Trying to match your face.

448
00:25:53,175 --> 00:25:55,100
He's moved on though.

449
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,206
He won't go back there.

450
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,534
I wouldn't.

451
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:05,567
The only way that
i'm reassured by that

452
00:26:05,634 --> 00:26:07,363
Is if i remember

453
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,488
That in the core of your chip

454
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,425
You're just like him.

455
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,400
Oh, god. She'll move us so fast.

456
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,734
You cannot tell her, okay?

457
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,175
Promise me.

458
00:26:24,367 --> 00:26:25,050
Hey.

459
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:26,800
Do i smell nail polish?

460
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,634
What are you guys talking about?

461
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:39,400
Just making conversation.

462
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,816
Sayles was always, uh-

463
00:28:07,128 --> 00:28:09,190
I loved him, but he
was an idiot sometimes.

464
00:28:09,613 --> 00:28:10,207
He was careless.

465
00:28:10,207 --> 00:28:13,234
You were following
barbara chamberlain.

466
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,988
I wasn't.

467
00:28:16,175 --> 00:28:17,925
I didn't know he was.

468
00:28:19,284 --> 00:28:20,800
There were a lot
of leads, you know.

469
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,238
We spent a lot of time on our own.

470
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:27,487
I didn't know.

471
00:28:38,134 --> 00:28:39,767
Mom, what are you doing?

472
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,550
Mom.

473
00:28:45,175 --> 00:28:47,206
Mom, talk to me.
What are you doing?

474
00:28:48,675 --> 00:28:50,408
Barbara's name is
in here somewhere.

475
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:53,042
On some list in some file.

476
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:54,566
She's buried in here.

477
00:28:55,508 --> 00:28:57,308
Why do we always find
out about these people

478
00:28:57,375 --> 00:28:58,709
When it's too late,
when they're dead?

479
00:28:59,987 --> 00:29:00,909
Do all these people have to die

480
00:29:00,975 --> 00:29:02,275
So that we can win?

481
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:03,362
Is that it?

482
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:07,176
Who else are you talking about?

483
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:12,175
Are you talking about andy goode?

484
00:29:13,999 --> 00:29:15,378
Is the virus ready?

485
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:19,175
City hall's closed.

486
00:29:19,975 --> 00:29:21,575
I leave in half an hour.

487
00:29:34,142 --> 00:29:36,709
I didn't know sayles
was tracking her.

488
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,238
You gotta believe me.

489
00:29:39,875 --> 00:29:41,253
I don't have to believe anything.

490
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:44,308
In fact, i don't.

491
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:48,275
Are you sure you know
where you're going?

492
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:49,341
Well, i should.

493
00:29:49,408 --> 00:29:50,159
This is where i lost kyle

494
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,675
To the machines when we were kids.

495
00:29:58,308 --> 00:29:59,642
We need to keep moving this way.

496
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:00,628
There's an elevator shaft.

497
00:30:12,475 --> 00:30:14,175
There shouldn't be a wall here.

498
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:17,508
In the future,
there's no wall here.

499
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,487
Meaning?

500
00:30:22,508 --> 00:30:23,831
Meaning we need to blow it up.

501
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:43,942
That's gonna draw attention.

502
00:30:44,238 --> 00:30:45,642
We're on a fault line.

503
00:30:45,709 --> 00:30:46,999
They'll think it was a tremor.

504
00:30:47,709 --> 00:30:49,050
Data center's on b-4.

505
00:30:50,642 --> 00:30:52,341
All right, let's go.

506
00:31:33,508 --> 00:31:34,775
It's working.

507
00:31:44,176 --> 00:31:45,508
What's going on?

508
00:31:45,575 --> 00:31:46,691
Are we good?

509
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:47,909
Something's wrong.

510
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:49,709
The system's blocking the virus.

511
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,175
We can still blow the place.

512
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:17,176
Hold it.

513
00:32:38,275 --> 00:32:39,675
Get them past here.

514
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:55,675
Freeze! 
Down on the ground now.

515
00:33:16,237 --> 00:33:17,238
Reese.

516
00:33:23,222 --> 00:33:25,050
Let's go.

517
00:33:49,612 --> 00:33:50,378
What's the matter?

518
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:53,709
I get in, i get to a certain point,

519
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:55,076
And it kicks me out.

520
00:33:55,142 --> 00:33:58,050
It's like a part of vick's
memory just turns off.

521
00:33:58,275 --> 00:34:00,408
I've even cranked up the juice.

522
00:34:02,642 --> 00:34:03,875
Oh.

523
00:34:03,942 --> 00:34:05,241
And there goes the power supply.

524
00:34:12,809 --> 00:34:14,050
That's weird.

525
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:15,475
My phone is dialing

526
00:34:15,542 --> 00:34:17,175
For an internet connection.

527
00:34:23,842 --> 00:34:25,109
What the hell?

528
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:26,709
Vick's reactivating.

529
00:34:31,393 --> 00:34:31,942
He's trying to get online?

530
00:34:49,109 --> 00:34:50,608
Did it happen? Did he get out?

531
00:34:50,675 --> 00:34:51,800
Did he call someone or something?

532
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:53,628
No.

533
00:34:55,076 --> 00:34:57,175
We should be very
careful with vick's chip.

534
00:34:59,142 --> 00:35:01,300
Yeah, that's the
understatement of the century.

535
00:35:06,341 --> 00:35:07,575
Well, how did it go?

536
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:09,176
It didn't work. We
should just blow it.

537
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:10,508
We can't go back there.

538
00:35:10,575 --> 00:35:11,842
What are you gonna do, take an axe

539
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:13,176
To every traffic light in town?

540
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,175
No.

541
00:35:16,875 --> 00:35:18,362
We only need to take down one.

542
00:35:38,113 --> 00:35:39,190
Two centimeters left.

543
00:35:41,113 --> 00:35:42,363
One centimeter down.

544
00:35:45,612 --> 00:35:48,222
Cut a semicircle with a
diameter of 12 centimeters.

545
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,145
Is it okay if i'm
off by a little bit?

546
00:35:51,211 --> 00:35:52,160
Yes.

547
00:35:52,545 --> 00:35:54,738
Cut a bigger circle to compensate.

548
00:35:55,712 --> 00:35:57,545
How exactly is this gonna work?

549
00:35:58,862 --> 00:36:02,425
Her neural network is the most
sophisticated learning computer on earth.

550
00:36:02,879 --> 00:36:04,979
If we can get her chip
into the a.R.T.I.E. System,

551
00:36:05,046 --> 00:36:06,478
It can take over the whole thing.

552
00:36:06,545 --> 00:36:08,512
Just like vick did with my laptop.

553
00:36:08,579 --> 00:36:10,078
She can kill it.

554
00:36:10,145 --> 00:36:11,879
You can get in through
a traffic light?

555
00:36:11,946 --> 00:36:12,863
Yes.

556
00:36:13,879 --> 00:36:14,999
Are you sure?

557
00:36:15,211 --> 00:36:16,145
No.

558
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:18,012
Are you sure?

559
00:36:18,078 --> 00:36:19,207
No.

560
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,545
Start the incision.

561
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:28,363
Push harder, down
to my endoskeleton.

562
00:36:31,345 --> 00:36:32,237
Sarah.

563
00:36:33,712 --> 00:36:35,278
Once she's in the city's mainframe,

564
00:36:35,345 --> 00:36:36,800
What's to say she'll come back out?

565
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:39,612
You know, maybe-

566
00:36:39,612 --> 00:36:41,679
Maybe it's not the turk
that created skynet.

567
00:36:41,745 --> 00:36:42,925
Maybe it's her.

568
00:36:43,078 --> 00:36:45,012
Maybe this was her plan all along.

569
00:36:45,078 --> 00:36:46,345
She's a machine.

570
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,612
She doesn't have a
soul and she never will.

571
00:36:49,178 --> 00:36:50,679
You don't have to trust her.

572
00:36:50,745 --> 00:36:52,012
You can trust me.

573
00:37:10,512 --> 00:37:11,112
Good.

574
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,979
Set the pliers over
the shielded tab

575
00:37:36,046 --> 00:37:37,145
On the end of the chip.

576
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:40,987
A half turn counterclockwise
and pull it out.

577
00:37:45,145 --> 00:37:46,831
It's okay, john.

578
00:37:49,675 --> 00:37:51,379
It's not the first
time we've done this.

579
00:38:20,878 --> 00:38:22,675
I have to get this
into the cpu interface.

580
00:38:26,478 --> 00:38:28,178
I'll take him to the traffic light.

581
00:39:06,879 --> 00:39:07,845
Okay, she's in.

582
00:39:07,912 --> 00:39:08,845
How long?

583
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:10,238
15 seconds.

584
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:12,345
20.

585
00:39:12,412 --> 00:39:13,737
For what it's worth,

586
00:39:14,312 --> 00:39:14,941
I believe you.

587
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:18,512
I don't think you knew your
guy was watching barbara.

588
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:19,845
Thanks.

589
00:39:28,912 --> 00:39:30,550
Okay, it's done.

590
00:39:33,979 --> 00:39:35,425
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

591
00:39:39,145 --> 00:39:40,745
Derek, don't.

592
00:39:40,812 --> 00:39:43,800
I want you to hear this
in no uncertain terms.

593
00:39:44,111 --> 00:39:46,800
Someday one of these
things is gonna kill you.

594
00:39:49,245 --> 00:39:50,425
It's not gonna be this one.

595
00:41:05,178 --> 00:41:06,800
What was it like?

596
00:41:07,745 --> 00:41:09,445
What'd you see in there?

597
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:12,957
I saw everything.

598
00:41:26,478 --> 00:41:28,012
Sarkissian returned my call.

599
00:41:28,078 --> 00:41:29,645
He'll meet about selling the turk.

600
00:41:29,712 --> 00:41:31,412
He's still got it?
When's the meeting?

601
00:41:31,737 --> 00:41:33,129
Tomorrow morning.

602
00:41:33,545 --> 00:41:36,912
Meaning this news
could have waited?

603
00:41:39,579 --> 00:41:41,345
You killed andy goode.

604
00:41:43,612 --> 00:41:45,512
There was no one
there to protect him.

605
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:46,712
And you killed him.

606
00:41:51,879 --> 00:41:54,113
You lie to me again, i'll kill you.

607
00:42:00,178 --> 00:42:02,145
So much danger in this world

608
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:03,566
Is hidden behind masks.

609
00:42:04,779 --> 00:42:07,425
We tell our children
stories of good and evil,

610
00:42:07,912 --> 00:42:09,738
While knowing it's not that simple.

611
00:42:10,478 --> 00:42:12,478
Do you realize that in 36 hours

612
00:42:12,545 --> 00:42:14,478
We'll be waking up in tahiti?

613
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:17,738
I can't believe you
bought us tickets.

614
00:42:18,412 --> 00:42:20,879
True evil doesn't
give us time to fight.

615
00:42:20,946 --> 00:42:22,440
Or to be afraid.

616
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:27,628
We keep our heads down,

617
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,410
Never bothering to
look behind the masks.

618
00:42:33,362 --> 00:42:34,925
And in doing so,

619
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:36,879
We resign ourselves
to terrible fates

620
00:42:36,879 --> 00:42:38,550
We can never see coming.

621
00:42:38,550 --> 00:42:43,979
