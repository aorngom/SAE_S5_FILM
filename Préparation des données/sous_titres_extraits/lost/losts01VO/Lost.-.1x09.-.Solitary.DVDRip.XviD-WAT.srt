1
00:01:16,776 --> 00:01:19,870
- Ow! Easy, jackass.
- You want it easy, quit moaning.

2
00:01:19,946 --> 00:01:24,246
- l got to change these bandages.
- Try not taking my skin off with them.

3
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,879
How'd l score
the house call, Dr. Quinn?

4
00:01:27,954 --> 00:01:31,253
- Trying to ease your conscience?
- My conscience is fine, thanks.

5
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,493
Of course, what have you got
to feel guilty about?

6
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,621
l mean, you just let that
damn Arab torture me.

7
00:01:37,697 --> 00:01:40,632
Stood by and watched.
Now you figure you'll patch me up

8
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,534
and buy you a ticket into heaven?
Only reason you're here...

9
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,233
l'm here because no one else
wants anything to do with you.

10
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,310
She does.

11
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,344
Change your own bandages.

12
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:18,070
Looking for someone,
or just admiring the view?

13
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:21,370
lt's been two days
since Sayid took off on his own.

14
00:02:22,408 --> 00:02:24,467
l keep thinking
l'm gonna see him.

15
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,069
He'll come when he's
found what he's looking for,

16
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,310
- the French transmission.
- He wasn't looking for anything.

17
00:02:31,117 --> 00:02:34,416
- He left because of what happened.
- lt was an accident.

18
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,615
Well, accidents happen when
you torture people, Jack.

19
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:43,125
Sayid's a trained soldier, Kate.

20
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,187
He can take care of himself.

21
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:20,832
[loud snapping]

22
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:22,901
[screaming]

00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,670

00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:17,284
- [rustling]
- [gasping]

28
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:23,761
Hello?

29
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:27,326
Hello?

30
00:04:49,822 --> 00:04:53,690
[woman] Ew! Get him out of there!
He's drinking our water.

31
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,390
- What's going on out there?
- [sighs] You know, the usual.

32
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,125
People yelling at each other.

33
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:03,134
Doc, what do you
think this is, this...

34
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,931
...this rash?
lt's bad, right?

35
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:07,598
- Some kind of a tropical disease?
- lt's hives.

36
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,733
What's that?
ls that like poison ivy?

37
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,208
lt's a common rash,

38
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:14,644
sometimes brought on
by heat and stress.

39
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:17,842
- Just try to relax. lt'll clear up.
- Right.

40
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,885
- Try to keep your mind off it.
- Okay.

41
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:22,853
What is that?
ls that like aloe?

42
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:25,356
lsn't that for sunburn or something?

43
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:27,484
''Try to keep your mind off it''?

44
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,427
What else has that guy
got to do but stress?

45
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,659
l have enough without having
to treat hypochondriacs.

46
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:35,496
That's like my point, man.

47
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,263
We're all fried.

48
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:41,334
l mean, have you taken
a look at everybody out there?

49
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:44,433
Everybody's way tense.

50
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,104
Dude, l'm just saying,
it... it'd be sweet

51
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,648
if we could have...

52
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,310
l don't know, something to do.

53
00:05:52,385 --> 00:05:54,444
We're surviving here, Hurley.

54
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,353
And that's my main concern,
is keeping us alive.

55
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,024
Things could be worse.

56
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:05,128
How?

57
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,927

- Who are you?
- [woman] <i>Wo ist</i> Alex?

what you are talking about.

00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:11,761
- Please, let's not...
- Where is Alex?

76
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:13,458
l don't know any Alex.

77
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:15,558
[electrical buzzing]

78
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:17,992
Stop!

[speaking in foreign language]

81
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,938
And all the pain will stop.

82
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:00,172
Your Shiite friends have already
implicated you in the bombing.

83
00:08:03,382 --> 00:08:05,976
You planted the device
in the headquarters!

84
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,987
You killed two soldiers!

85
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,389
Confess it, and perhaps
it will only cost you your hands

86
00:08:13,459 --> 00:08:15,518
instead of your life.

87
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:17,359
[coughing]

88
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,261

89
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,461
[Sayid] He doesn't know anything.

90
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,370
- Your sources were wrong.
- [man] Perhaps.

91
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,967
But that's really not the point, is it?

92
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:34,570
- You handled yourself well in there.
- [Sayid] Did l?

93
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,844
[man] l put in for your reassignment
to intelligence division,

94
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,216
- if you still wish it.
- Yes, sir. Very much so.

95
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,085
Good. But stop calling me ''sir''
when it's just the two of us.

96
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,550
You're my superior officer, Omar.

97
00:08:48,628 --> 00:08:49,822
For now.

98
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:52,456
[Omar] And l'll enjoy it
while it lasts.

99
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,897
That reminds me,

100
00:08:53,966 --> 00:08:57,493
in addition to your
increased responsibilities,

101
00:08:57,570 --> 00:09:00,061
a promotion is commensurate
with your move.

102
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:03,870
That is, if you won't miss
being a communications officer.

103
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:07,938
- l am willing to make that sacrifice.
- Good.

104
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:19,721
- Hi.
- Yo.

105
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,660
- What's this?
- They must have fallen from the plane.

106
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,323
What are you doing
in the jungle at night?

107
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,300
- Best time to hunt.
- Ethan here has some experience.

108
00:09:29,368 --> 00:09:32,769
He spotted tracks that might be
a rabbit or some other rodent.

109
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:34,669
Rodent. Yum.

110
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,935
People are getting tired
of boar meat.

111
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,239
You got that right.

112
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,777
All right, well,
l'll take a look at these,

113
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,181
- see if there's anything useful.
- Okay.

114
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,061
Mr. Locke.

115
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:08,197
Are you going back out to hunt?

116
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,832
- For a bit.
- Can l go with you?

117
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,434
l mean, l just want to learn
how to do what you do.

118
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,910

119
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,243

to Mr. Locke about...

120
00:10:17,316 --> 00:10:21,184
l know what you're doing.
Not gonna happen, man. Get back to bed.

121
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:29,825
Whoa, dude...

122
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,928
- [Sayid screaming]
- [electrical buzzing]

123
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,868
Please just listen to me!

124
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,205
l keep telling you
l don't know who Alex is!

125
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,779
l'm a survivor of a plane crash.

126
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:51,647
l found the wire on the beach.
l followed it.

127
00:10:51,717 --> 00:10:55,619
[panting] l thought it might
have something to do with

128
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,521
a transmission
we picked up on a receiver.

129
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,355
A recording, a mayday

130
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:05,887
with a French woman
repeating on a loop for 1 6 years.

131
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,831
[woman speaking French]

132
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,775
[continuing in French]

133
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,876
Sixteen years.

134
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,382
Has it really been that long?

135
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:34,184
You.

136
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,388
You just happened
to hear my distress call?

137
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,100
l know what you are.

138
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,343
[Sayid groans]

139
00:12:08,294 --> 00:12:10,057
Rousseau.

140
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:15,732
- How do you know my name?
- l read it.

141
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,796
There, on the jacket.

142
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,134
What is this place?

143
00:12:24,543 --> 00:12:27,535
Those batteries wouldn't be able
to produce enough power

144
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:30,377
to transmit your distress call
all these years.

145
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,849
Broadcasts from somewhere else.

146
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:36,050
But they control it now.

147
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:38,787
They?

148
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,286
You. And the others like you.

149
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,989
[sighs] l...

150
00:12:45,064 --> 00:12:48,966
l don't know who you think l am.
l've already told you. l am not...

151
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,160
Sayid?

152
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:55,135
- How...?
- My name was on a jacket.

153
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,836
Yours is on the envelope you carry.
Who is she?

154
00:13:03,816 --> 00:13:06,944
The woman in the photographs.

155
00:13:09,822 --> 00:13:11,722
Nadia.

156
00:13:12,324 --> 00:13:15,122
Her name is Nadia.

157
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,488
[Omar] We cannot tie Noor Abed Jazeem
to the bombing,

158
00:13:19,565 --> 00:13:21,294
but we know her sympathies.

159
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:25,531
She's a known associate
of Kurdish and Shiite insurgents.

160
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:27,697
She knows who orchestrated
the bombing?

161
00:13:27,773 --> 00:13:30,765
That, my friend,
is exactly what you will find out.

162
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,276
[door slams shut]

163
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:40,978
Noor Abed Jazeem.

164
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,817
l'm going to ask you
some questions.

165
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,824
lf you refuse to cooperate,
l'm going to hurt you.

166
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:50,055
Nobody calls me Noor, Sayid.

167
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:53,231
You of all people should know that.

168
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,562
What?

169
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,673
You don't remember me?

170
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,307
Am l so different from the girl
in the schoolyard

171
00:14:06,378 --> 00:14:08,744
who used to push you in the mud?

172
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,181
- Nadia.
- And your mother would tell my mother,

173
00:14:14,253 --> 00:14:18,053
''Why must you pick on little Sayid?''

174
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:19,920
And l'd answer,

175
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:22,722
''Because he ignores me.''

176
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,456
You had enough attention,

177
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:30,195
with your family's wealth and...
your charm.

178
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,704
Such things matter little to children.

179
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,900
But then, you always were
older than your years,

180
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:39,444
weren't you, Sayid?

181
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:42,837
Not old enough to understand
that being pushed

182
00:14:42,915 --> 00:14:45,349
was a sign of affection.

183
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,613
Now you're a traitor
to your country.

184
00:14:54,493 --> 00:14:58,020
Tell me what you know
about the bombing, Nadia.

185
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,828
Tell me, or l swear
l will hurt you.

186
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,928
Hmm. Oh, l know, Sayid.

187
00:15:06,005 --> 00:15:09,668
This is not my first interrogation
by the Republican Guard.

188
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,609
This is where they
burned me with acid.

189
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,772
They pierced my hands
with a drill.

190
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:17,975
Would you like to see
the soles of my feet?

191
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:20,450
Where they flayed the skin off?

192
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,545
These are handiworks of your friends.

193
00:15:26,191 --> 00:15:29,285
The people you swear allegiance to.

194
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,661
lf you were innocent, l'm sorry.

195
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:36,232
But this bombing
is a different matter.

196
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,106
- Nadia...
- Go on, Sayid.

197
00:15:41,173 --> 00:15:43,607
Do your work.

198
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,839
l'm not going to
tell you anything.

199
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,181
Then l'm going to hurt you.

200
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:52,783
l know.

201
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,718
[Rousseau] You have a bullet wound.

202
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,721
l was a soldier.

203
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,852
You were?

204
00:16:02,928 --> 00:16:04,327
And are you still?

205
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:08,294
lt was a long time ago.

206
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,334
Tell me more about her,
the woman. Nadia.

207
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,715
Alex... who is he?

208
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:34,022
[Walt] l'm bored.
Can l take Vincent to the beach?

209
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:38,291
Um... l'll take you later.
l'm in the middle of something.

210
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:39,854
But there's nothing to do.

211
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:42,025
Well, you got to figure out
stuff to do.

212
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,695
You got to find a way
to entertain yourself.

213
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:46,499
[Hurley] Come on.

214
00:16:46,572 --> 00:16:49,166
Come on. l know l saw it.

215
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,740
Yes.

216
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:55,469
- Hurley, uh...
- Hold on, man. l'm busy.

217
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,007
- Dude, can l borrow this?
- What?

218
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:01,780
- Thanks, man.
- [Jack] What are you doing?

219
00:17:07,493 --> 00:17:10,018
So you heard my transmission,

220
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:13,292
- came looking for me, for answers.
- l didn't know you were alive.

221
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,662
- Still lying.
- l'm not lying.

222
00:17:16,735 --> 00:17:20,466
Lies! Like this plane crash
that you survived.

223
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,564
- There were others?
- More than 40.

224
00:17:22,641 --> 00:17:24,506
Then why are you alone?

225
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:28,677
- l left them.
- Why?

226
00:17:30,115 --> 00:17:31,810
There was...

227
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,144
l did something.

228
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:41,119
Something l'm ashamed of.

229
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,592
And Nadia...

230
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:48,628
...you left her too?

231
00:17:49,134 --> 00:17:51,967
She wasn't on the plane.

232
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:57,204
She's dead.

233
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,404
Because of me.

234
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,557
l'm so sorry.

235
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:35,010
l want to show you something.

236
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:39,213
[Michael] See, this junction here

237
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:43,084
reroutes some of the spring's water flow
into suspended basins.

238
00:18:43,155 --> 00:18:45,487
Pop in some holes,
you got showers.

239
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,923
You keep the drinking water separate.

240
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,257
This is... You drew this?

241
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,760
- l was an artist in a previous life.
- l thought you were in construction.

242
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,234
- l am. l mean l was. Long story.
- [Charlie] Hey, Jack!

243
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:01,704
Hurley's worked up about something.
Said we should see it.

244
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,975
[Hurley] Welcome...

245
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,015
...to the first and...

246
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,278
...hopefully last,

247
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:14,717
lsland Open.

248
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,056
- What?
- lt's two holes, for now.

249
00:19:19,124 --> 00:19:21,991
- Three par, and no waiting.
- [Jack] Hurley...

250
00:19:23,362 --> 00:19:25,193
You built a golf course?

251
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,756
Rich idiots fly to tropical islands
to whack balls around.

252
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,166
All the stuff we got
to deal with, man,

253
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:33,431
this is what you've been
wasting time on?

254
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,372
Dudes, listen. Our lives suck.

255
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,671
Nerves are stretched to the max.

256
00:19:38,744 --> 00:19:41,770
l mean, we're lost on an island,

257
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,476
running from boars and monsters...

258
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,486
- Freakin' polar bears!
- Polar bears?

259
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:50,545
You didn't hear
about the polar bear?

260
00:19:50,622 --> 00:19:54,558
lf we're stuck here, then just
surviving's not gonna cut it.

261
00:19:54,626 --> 00:19:58,084
We need some kind of relief.
We need some way that we can...

262
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:02,925
...you know, have fun.
That's right, fun.

263
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:06,402
Or we're gonna go crazy, waiting
for the next bad thing to happen.

264
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:16,247
[Rousseau] lt's a music box,
but it's broken.

265
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,977
Has been...

266
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,646
...for a long time.

267
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,188
lt was a gift from my love

268
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:25,951
for our anniversary.

269
00:20:26,024 --> 00:20:28,015
You mean Alex.

270
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:30,061
Robert.

271
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:35,691
lt was such a comfort to me
the first few years here.

272
00:20:38,837 --> 00:20:40,395
l could fix it for you.

273
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:44,767
l could take a look at it
if you freed my hands.

274
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:51,882
l'm fairly good
with mechanical things.

275
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:55,953
l'll need my hands.

276
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,195
What is written on the back
of your photograph?

277
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:10,099
- What are you doing?
- Did she write it, or did you?

278
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,836
Perhaps you don't want to tell me
because it causes too much pain.

279
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:24,738
Rousseau...

280
00:21:26,785 --> 00:21:28,582
You don't need to do that.

281
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,021
- This is a problem, man.
- Yeah.

282
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:42,658
l mean, l know what l'd do, but...

283
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:46,028
...it's gotta be your call.

284
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:52,206
Okay.

285
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,110
- Give me a 7 iron.
- Got it.

286
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,550
[Jack] Hey!

287
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,780
Heads up over there!

288
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,520
- [Charlie] No chance!
- [Hurley] Don't blow it!

289
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,615
[Charlie] You won't
get anywhere near us!

290
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:11,689
[man] Hey! Doc!

291
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:13,253
There you are.

292
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,391
Somebody said
you went this way.

293
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:18,766
Listen, that rash of mine
is starting to spread.

294
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,032
lt's like the size of a grape...

295
00:22:21,106 --> 00:22:23,472
What are you guys doing?

296
00:22:23,608 --> 00:22:26,008
- [Jack] Uh...
- Are you playing golf?

297
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,172
Yeah.

298
00:22:31,116 --> 00:22:32,515
Can l play?

299
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:45,561
[grunts, panting]

300
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,190
Sorry about the sedative.

301
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,463
lt was the only safe way
for me to move you.

302
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:56,973
You offered to fix
my music box.

303
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,509
After all l've done to you.

304
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,205
Striking you, shocking you.

305
00:23:02,013 --> 00:23:03,037
Why?

306
00:23:09,354 --> 00:23:12,255
Do you want me to fix
your music box, or don't you?

307
00:23:14,826 --> 00:23:17,920
Yes. Yes, please.

308
00:23:19,664 --> 00:23:21,632
Then l want to know your name.

309
00:23:22,601 --> 00:23:24,626
Your first name.

310
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,402
Danielle.

311
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,304
My name is Danielle.

312
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,475
And how did you come to be
on this island, Danielle?

313
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,110
[sighs]

314
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:53,228
We were part
of a science team.

315
00:23:53,298 --> 00:23:55,926
A science team
armed with rifles.

316
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:01,200
- Was Robert on the team?
- Yes.

317
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,001
And Alex, was he, too?

318
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:06,135
Our vessel was three days
out of Tahiti

319
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,543
when our instruments malfunctioned.

320
00:24:09,714 --> 00:24:11,807
lt was night.

321
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:14,215
The storm...

322
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:17,212
The sounds...

323
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,387
The ship slammed into rocks,

324
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,893
ran aground,

325
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,429
the hull breached
beyond repair.

326
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,058
So...

327
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,499
...we made camp.

328
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,436
Dug out this temporary shelter.

329
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,972
Temporary.

330
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,909
Nearly two months
we survived here.

331
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,144
Two months before...

332
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,177
Your distress signal.
The message l heard.

333
00:24:50,255 --> 00:24:53,383
You said ''lt killed them all.''

334
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:06,364
We were coming back
from the black rock.

335
00:25:09,641 --> 00:25:11,370
lt was them.

336
00:25:13,745 --> 00:25:15,337
They were the carriers.

337
00:25:15,413 --> 00:25:18,507
Who were the carriers?

338
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,676
The others.

339
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:24,053
What others?

340
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:26,488
What is the black rock?

341
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:30,353
Have you seen other people
on this island?

342
00:25:30,428 --> 00:25:31,952
No.

343
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,895
But l hear them.

344
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,293
Out there in the jungle.

345
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:40,833
They whisper.

346
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:53,040
You think l'm insane.

347
00:25:57,122 --> 00:26:00,353
l think you've been alone
for too long.

348
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,162
[door opening]

349
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:21,241
l'm sorry.
This is all l could find.

350
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:24,578
l'll try and bring you
some fruit later on.

351
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:27,376
Are you ready to talk?

352
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:31,718
That depends on what you'd like
to talk about, Sayid.

353
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,818
Books?

354
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,087
Weather?

355
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,096
Since l've seen neither
locked in this cell for weeks,

356
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,598
l'm afraid my conversation
will suffer.

357
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,100
We have two suspects
in custody.

358
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,296
Have a look at these photographs.

359
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,932
All you need to do is nod.

360
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:51,976
lf you prove you're willing
to cooperate,

361
00:26:52,043 --> 00:26:54,204
l think l can get them to free you.

362
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:04,249
Then l won't have these visits
to look forward to anymore.

363
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,721
This isn't a game, Nadia.

364
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,853
Yet you keep playing it, Sayid.

365
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:16,632
Pretending to be something
l know you're not.

366
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:29,302
- [Boone] You'll never believe this.
- You learned how to tie your shoes?

367
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:32,475
Funny. Someone at the caves
built a golf course.

368
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,314
- Are you high?
- Seriously, a golf course.

369
00:27:35,387 --> 00:27:37,116
Jack's playing right now.

370
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:38,348
[Kate] Jack?

371
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:42,289
- ls golfing?
- That's what l hear.

372
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:47,091
l don't know about you,
but l'm gonna check this out.

373
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:48,894
Wait for me, bonehead.

374
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,774
Doctor playing golf.

375
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,504
Whoo! Boy howdy,
now l've heard everything.

376
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:05,276
- What's next, cop eating a donut?
- lf you want to come, you should say.

377
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,877
Think l'll pass on that, Freckles.
Not big on crowds.

378
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,888
And let's face it,
crowd's not too hot on me, either.

379
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:19,525
One outcast to another, l'd think
about making more of an effort.

380
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:25,166
Duly noted.

381
00:28:26,104 --> 00:28:29,631
[music box playing]

382
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:32,607
You see?

383
00:28:36,981 --> 00:28:38,846
Some things can be fixed.

384
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:41,886
[gasping]

385
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:47,720
Thank you.

386
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:50,923
Thank you so much.

387
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,891
[laughing]

388
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,700
Thank you so much.

389
00:28:57,769 --> 00:28:59,828
Danielle,

390
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:02,236
please let me go.

391
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,567
Go?

392
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,409
Back to the people
l told you about.

393
00:29:12,383 --> 00:29:14,578
You can't. You have to stay.

394
00:29:14,652 --> 00:29:17,416
- lt's not safe.
- Not safe? What's not safe?

395
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,286
You need me. You can't leave.

396
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:20,551
Danielle.

397
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:23,253
[roaring]

398
00:29:26,498 --> 00:29:28,466
Where are you going?

399
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,229
- lf we're lucky, it's one of the bears.
- lf we're lucky?

400
00:29:31,302 --> 00:29:33,293
[snarling]

401
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,847
[Sayid] lt might be
that thing out there.

402
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:46,744
The monster.

403
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,252
There's no such thing as monsters.

404
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,158
- [Omar] You have to execute her.
- What?

405
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:01,289
The Jazeem woman
has given us nothing.

406
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,096
This will send a message
to others who will not talk.

407
00:30:04,169 --> 00:30:05,830
l just need more time with her.

408
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:08,498
You have had more
than a month, Sayid.

409
00:30:08,573 --> 00:30:11,508
Now bring her outside
and shoot her,

410
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:13,544
or l will.

411
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:17,639
ls this a problem?

412
00:30:18,716 --> 00:30:19,842
No.

413
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:23,081
- lt's not a problem.
- Good.

414
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:27,556
[door clanging open]

415
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:35,896
What did you bring me today?

416
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,840
Put it on.

417
00:30:45,643 --> 00:30:48,009
Are you going to hurt me, Sayid?

418
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:35,784
Ugh!

419
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,193
- [Hurley] Dude, l think you stuck it.
- [Charlie] Lucky, lucky.

420
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,323
This thing have a ladies' team?

421
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,562
- Hey.
- Hey.

422
00:31:43,635 --> 00:31:45,899
- When'd you show up?
- While ago.

423
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:49,106
l almost didn't recognize you.

424
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,403
You're smiling.

425
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,307
l have to watch that. [chuckles]

426
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,308
So, how'd you come up with this?

427
00:31:56,381 --> 00:31:58,246
Wasn't me.
lt was all Hurley.

428
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,611
l've been going crazy
to make everyone feel safe.

429
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:04,746
l haven't been sleeping
'cause l want everyone to feel safe.

430
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,619
He builds a golf course,

431
00:32:06,691 --> 00:32:10,286
- and everyone feels safe.
- Aw, crap! Do-over.

432
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,762
lt's a Mulligan.

433
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:15,890
[Charlie] A gentleman's sport.
You got to get the words right.

434
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,628
- Dad.
- Hey. Check this out.

435
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,102
- You want to...
- Let me.

436
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:21,604
- Get away!
- All right.

437
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,300
You left me alone at the caves.

438
00:32:23,374 --> 00:32:25,137
What? l left you with Claire.

439
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,540
She's sleeping.

440
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,738
Oh, man, l'm... l'm sorry.

441
00:32:28,813 --> 00:32:31,043
l just... l just got caught up.

442
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:34,448
l'm really sorry, Walt.
l screwed up.

443
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,680
l'll make it up to you.
Hey, you wanna play?

444
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:39,053
[laughter]

445
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:42,115
[Charlie] You're breathing out.
When you go up...

446
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,956
Nah. There's other people waiting.

447
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:46,588
They won't mind.
You want to take a swing?

448
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:48,393
[Charlie] Michael, it's your shot.

449
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,902
Okay, cool.
Uh, so we'll play later, okay?

450
00:33:07,218 --> 00:33:09,413
[rustling]

451
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,431
Put the gun down, Danielle.

452
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,804
Put it down on the ground.

453
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:34,642
Don't.

454
00:33:39,784 --> 00:33:41,979
[door slams]

455
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,491
l'll take it from here.

456
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,033
[door shuts]

457
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:09,070
What... what's going on?

458
00:34:09,147 --> 00:34:12,048
Forty meters outside this door,
there's a supply truck

459
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:15,108
that will be leaving.
They don't check them on the way out.

460
00:34:15,186 --> 00:34:17,780
Only coming in. Get inside.

461
00:34:17,855 --> 00:34:19,686
Cover yourself any way you can.

462
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:23,921
They won't reach the city for
30 minutes. That's enough time to hide.

463
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,759
Come with me.

464
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:28,856
l can't.

465
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:30,491
Desertion.

466
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:33,936
They would kill my family.

467
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,835
l don't have your courage.

468
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,400
You have more than you know.

469
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,079
Nadia, you have to go.

470
00:34:47,051 --> 00:34:48,746
[Omar] Sayid?

471
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,114
What are you doing?

472
00:34:58,229 --> 00:34:59,560
Don't.

473
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,331
- Guard!
- [Nadia screams]

474
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:10,797
Sayid! Now you have to come
with me! They'll kill you!

475
00:35:10,875 --> 00:35:13,901
No. You escaped, you stole my gun,
and you shot him.

476
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,076
And then you shot me.

477
00:35:19,817 --> 00:35:21,148
[gunshot]

478
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,346
Sayid!

479
00:35:24,322 --> 00:35:26,085
[Sayid groaning]

480
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:30,790
[panting] Take it.

481
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,353
Please, Nadia.

482
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,365
Take it and go.

483
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:52,247
[truck driving away]

484
00:35:56,687 --> 00:35:58,655
[Sayid] Please,
l don't wish to hurt you.

485
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,791
You already have.

486
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:03,926
Don't.

487
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,590
[gun clicks without firing]

488
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,637
The firing pin
has been removed.

489
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:18,231
Robert didn't notice
it was missing, either,

490
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:21,006
when l shot him.

491
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:25,272
- But you loved him.
- He was sick.

492
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:26,646
Sick?

493
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,009
lt took them...

494
00:36:30,087 --> 00:36:32,578
...one after the other.

495
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:35,792
l had no choice.

496
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,658
They were already lost.

497
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,926
- You killed them.
- What would have happened

498
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,366
if we were rescued?

499
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:47,927
l couldn't let that happen.

500
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:49,529
l won't!

501
00:36:50,241 --> 00:36:52,004
l'm not sick.

502
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,443
l know.

503
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,580
Then why kill me?

504
00:37:00,384 --> 00:37:03,785
l can't let you go.

505
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:07,249
Don't you understand?

506
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:10,886
To have someone to talk to...

507
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:13,254
...to touch.

508
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:20,369
''You'll find me in the next life,

509
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,406
if not in this one.''

510
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:25,164
What?

511
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,269
The writing on the back
of Nadia's photograph.

512
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,209
l know what it's like
to hold on to someone.

513
00:37:35,486 --> 00:37:40,185
l've been holding on for seven years
to just a thought.

514
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:44,490
A blind hope that somewhere
she's still alive.

515
00:37:47,732 --> 00:37:49,859
But the more l hold on,

516
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,234
the more l pull away
from those around me.

517
00:37:57,308 --> 00:37:59,208
The only way off this...

518
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:03,780
...this place, is with their help.

519
00:38:23,768 --> 00:38:25,531
Come with me.

520
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,297
You don't have to be
alone, Danielle.

521
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,657
Your people,

522
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:57,633
the ones you're determined
to get back to.

523
00:38:57,702 --> 00:38:59,465
Watch them.

524
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,832
Watch them closely.

525
00:39:14,251 --> 00:39:15,741
Danielle!

526
00:39:17,088 --> 00:39:18,919
Who is Alex?

527
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,524
Alex was my child.

528
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,646
[laughing]

529
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,409
Guys, please.

530
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,779
l've never made par
