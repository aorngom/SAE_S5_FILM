[screaming]

3
00:00:11,277 --> 00:00:14,212
- Mayday, Mayday!
- <i>[static, speaking in French on radio]</i>

4
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:17,716
The French are coming! l've never
been so happy to hear the French.

5
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:20,719
- Does anyone speak French?
- <i>[French continues on radio]</i>

6
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:23,654
[Shannon] ''l'm alone now.

7
00:00:23,723 --> 00:00:25,486
On the island alone.

8
00:00:25,558 --> 00:00:27,753
Please, someone come.

9
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,756
They're dead.

10
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:31,592
lt killed them.

11
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,164
lt killed them all.''

12
00:00:34,234 --> 00:00:38,864
Guys... where are we?

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,974
[Sayid] l found the wire on the beach.

14
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,808
l thought it might have something to do
with the transmission we picked up.

15
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,975
...with a Frenchwoman
repeating on a loop for 1 6 years.

16
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,847
Has it really been that long?

17
00:00:52,485 --> 00:00:53,474
You.

18
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,884
Your people,

19
00:00:54,954 --> 00:00:57,718
the ones you're determined
to get back to.

20
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,019
Watch them closely.

21
00:01:00,093 --> 00:01:03,153
[Claire sobbing] l mean,
l was sleeping, and l woke up,

22
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,356
and he was trying to hurt my baby!

23
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:08,367
- We gotta find out who everyone is.
- Wanna start a census?

24
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:11,768
[Hurley] l interviewed
everyone at the beach. Jack.

25
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:15,004
One of them isn't in the manifest.

26
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:17,610
He wasn't on the plane.

27
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,070
We're not the only people
on this island,

28
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:21,738
and we all know it!

29
00:01:22,715 --> 00:01:24,114
They've attacked us!

30
00:01:24,184 --> 00:01:28,143
Sabotaged us,
abducted us, murdered us.

31
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:31,054
Maybe it's time we started
worrying about them.

32
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,455
[Sayid] Danielle?

33
00:01:36,529 --> 00:01:37,962
What are you doing here?

34
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:39,794
When l saw black smoke...

35
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,930
That night, they came.

36
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,264
[Rousseau] You have only three choices.

37
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,738
Run.

38
00:01:49,576 --> 00:01:51,544
Hide.

39
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,078
Or die.

40
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,811
[Jack] All l can tell you
is we do have a plan.

41
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:59,215
[Arzt] Go into the jungle,
get some dynamite, blow open a hatch,

42
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,150
and then you hide
everyone inside.

43
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,815
God knows how long that
dynamite has been out there.

44
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:07,121
So, unless you want to blow up,

45
00:02:07,193 --> 00:02:09,252
l'm coming with you.

46
00:02:11,598 --> 00:02:13,930
- [Michael] Good luck.
- Same to you.

47
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:18,827
- See you soon.
- Yes, you will.

48
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,412
[Michael] Keep it straight.

49
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:37,945
Go, go!

50
00:02:38,024 --> 00:02:39,491
[Walt] Bye, Vincent.

51
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:41,026
- Come on, go.
- Bye, Vincent.

52
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,760
[cheering]

53
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:53,332
[baby crying]

54
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,975
Okay. [sighing]

55
00:02:59,045 --> 00:03:00,034
Shhh.

56
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,379
Claire. Everybody's leaving.

57
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,352
Well, l can't go anywhere,
all right?

58
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,719
l've got the baby
and l'm... l'm so tired.

59
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:12,883
l can't... can't carry him.

60
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,723
And now he's wet
and there's sand everywhere.

61
00:03:15,795 --> 00:03:18,787
- l don't have anymore nappies.
- Why don't you let me help?

62
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,800
No, look, nobody ever taught me
how to do this. Okay?

63
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,803
- lt's gonna be okay.
- Why do people keep telling me that?

64
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,532
Are they the ones with the baby?

65
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,405
[Sayid] We've got to get there
before sundown.

66
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:32,671
Once you reach the caves,
stay there.

67
00:03:32,745 --> 00:03:35,270
The rest of us will be
right behind you.

68
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:37,444
Sayid.

69
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:40,508
l need a gun.

70
00:03:41,521 --> 00:03:43,113
l know Jack gave 'em to you.

71
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:45,821
l want one right now.
l have to protect Claire.

72
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,326
Rousseau said the others
won't be here till night.

73
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,828
She's certifiable.
What if they show up before?

74
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:54,230
- Last time you had a sidearm...
- l killed a murderer. l did us a favor.

75
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:57,235
You're emotionally involved.
Let me handle the weapons.

76
00:03:57,303 --> 00:04:00,568
You're not here all the time.
You can't protect her. l need a gun.

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,235
lf you want to help Claire, get her
packed, carry her child to the caves.

78
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,470
That's what she needs.

79
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:35,930
How exactly does something
like this happen?

80
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,603
Are you on the same island as l am?

81
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:44,813
l guess that explains it.

82
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:47,652
Hold on, wait...
Hold, wait.

83
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,483
What are we,
a couple miles inland?

84
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,115
A tsunami probably
swept it here. Huh? Right?

85
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,823
[Jack] Hey.

86
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,293
Hey, where are you going?

87
00:04:56,362 --> 00:04:58,694
The explosives are
in the hold of the ship.

88
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,357
[Jack] Rousseau, wait.

89
00:05:03,403 --> 00:05:06,463
l did what you asked.
You need dynamite.

90
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,063
You don't need me.

91
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,934
Let her go, Jack.

92
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:14,579
Who's gonna lead us back?

93
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,274
l'll lead us back.

94
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,282
Damn it.

95
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,153
You heard her.
Explosives are in the hold. Let's go.

96
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,492
Hold on. l came here to tell you
how to handle dynamite,

97
00:05:31,564 --> 00:05:33,532
not explore a ghost ship.
You think...

98
00:05:33,599 --> 00:05:35,590
Just... stay out here.

99
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,706
Um...

100
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:44,470
l'm gonna stay out here
and hang with Arnzt.

101
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,998
[rattling]

102
00:06:37,663 --> 00:06:39,290
[Locke] Slaves.

103
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:48,530
[crashing]

104
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:51,338
This ship must have been
en route to a mining colony.

105
00:06:52,378 --> 00:06:54,972
Probably set off from
the eastern coast of Africa.

106
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,571
Mozambique.

107
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:38,818
Jack. John. Over here.

108
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,465
...and then my third wife,
she says, get this,

109
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,196
''l didn't sign up for this.''

110
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:54,137
You tell me, what the hell
is that even supposed to mean?

111
00:07:56,342 --> 00:07:58,276
What, am l boring you?

112
00:07:59,445 --> 00:08:00,434
Huh?

113
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,539
You know what? l'm sorry.

114
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,450
l'm sorry that l'm not cool
enough to be part of your

115
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,318
merry little band of adventurers.

116
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:11,481
What?

117
00:08:11,557 --> 00:08:14,424
l know a clique when l see it.
l teach high school, pally!

118
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:17,558
You know, you people think

119
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,758
you're the only ones on
this island doing anything of value.

120
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,425
l got news for you.

121
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,335
There were 40 other survivors
of this plane crash,

122
00:08:25,404 --> 00:08:28,100
and we are all people too.

123
00:08:30,743 --> 00:08:32,677
Okay.

124
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,443
You know what,

125
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,505
l can probably get it
open if l just...

126
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,140
No.
We should take it outside.

127
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,214
Why? You don't
even know if this...

128
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,653
You're not prying open a crate
that says ''Explosives'' with a pickax.

129
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,787
[Locke] Yeah, l agree with Jack.

130
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:47,984
Take it outside, open it there.

131
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,656
Okay.

132
00:08:51,297 --> 00:08:53,197
l got it.

133
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,699
You mind showing us the way?

134
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,002
[Arzt] lt's not just the teenagers.
The gym teachers,

135
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:06,033
you think they let me sit with them
in the cafeteria? No. They do not.

136
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,545
This is all in your head.

137
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,410
Really? You explain
to me why Kate

138
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,007
gets the best pieces
of wreckage for her shelter?

139
00:09:12,084 --> 00:09:15,451
And the Korean guy. Does he catch
fish for everybody on the island?

140
00:09:15,521 --> 00:09:17,386
No. He does not. He doesn't.

141
00:09:18,925 --> 00:09:21,917
And some of us have actually
lost weight while we were here.

142
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:24,588
You mind telling me
where you're hiding the carbs?

143
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,757
- 'Cause l can't figure...
- [creaking]

144
00:09:26,832 --> 00:09:28,800
What the hell
are you people doing?

145
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,868
Wait, wait. Stop.
Stop right where you are.

146
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:35,373
Put that down carefully.
Put it down carefully.

147
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:38,173
Put it gently...
Gently. Damn it!

148
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,077
Carefully, gently. Gently.

149
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:45,248
Get outta there.
Get away from it. Come on.

150
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,583
- Get out. Move away from it.
- What the hell is your...?

151
00:09:48,654 --> 00:09:49,985
Shh. Be quiet.

152
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,291
Do any of you have any idea

153
00:09:55,361 --> 00:10:00,492
what happens to dynamite
in 90-plus degree heat? Huh?

154
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,531
Do you know?

155
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,326
Any of you?

156
00:10:08,207 --> 00:10:11,699
lt sweats nitroglycerin.

157
00:10:12,878 --> 00:10:14,402
[sighs]

158
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,074
What are you doing?
Did l ask you to come closer?

159
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,457
Dynamite...

160
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:31,162
...is nitroglycerine
stabilized by clay.

161
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,329
Nitroglycerine...

162
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:41,401
...is the most dangerous and unstable
explosive known to man.

163
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,338
Hey Kate, gimme your shirt.

164
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:50,246
Now. Princess, give me your shirt.
l need to wrap the dynamite.

165
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:52,443
Just throw it to me, right here.

166
00:10:52,518 --> 00:10:54,281
Just be careful.
Come on, hurry up.

167
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:56,753
Okay, good. Now back up.

168
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,313
Back up. Just back up.

169
00:10:59,392 --> 00:11:00,791
Get outta my way.

170
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,259
Any of you ever hear

171
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:05,797
about the guy
who invented nitroglycerin?

172
00:11:05,865 --> 00:11:07,662
Probably not,

173
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,827
because he blew
his freaking face off.

174
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:15,201
His lab assistant
came into the room,

175
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,466
saw that his mentor had detonated,

176
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:21,304
and he said<i>:</i> ''Huh.

177
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,378
l guess this stuff does work.''

178
00:11:25,084 --> 00:11:26,813
[sighs]

179
00:11:28,621 --> 00:11:31,249
We're not gonna take
more of this stuff than we need,

180
00:11:31,323 --> 00:11:34,121
because nitroglycerine
is extremely temperamental.

181
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,182
So we just...

182
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:45,830
Dude.

183
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:09,852
[speaking in Korean]

184
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,327
Ahhh!

185
00:12:30,049 --> 00:12:32,609
- Sorry for the inconvenience.
- l'm sure you are.

186
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:34,585
Sir, your bag was unattended.

187
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:37,047
- Am l free to go?
- Yes, sir.

188
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,317
Good.

189
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,449
l have a plane to catch.

190
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:51,194
Could you hand me a
paper towel there, bud?

191
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,104
Uh, paper towel,
this one's broken.

192
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,141
- Uh...
- Oh.

193
00:12:56,208 --> 00:13:00,269
Oh. You don't speak English. Sorry.

194
00:13:04,683 --> 00:13:07,015

196
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,395
Dad, look!

197
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,875
How does a place this big
never get discovered?

198
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,814
[Sawyer] Don't know.

199
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:51,783
But you could build yourself one hell
of a beach resort right over there.

200
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:54,519
Yeah, you build your resort.

201
00:14:54,593 --> 00:14:56,993
l'm happy to say goodbye
to this place forever.

202
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:03,594
What about everybody else?
Think they'll be okay?

203
00:15:03,669 --> 00:15:06,638
- [Sawyer singing <i>Redemption Song]</i>
- l hope so, buddy.

204
00:15:06,772 --> 00:15:08,933
At least until we can
get 'em some help.

205
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,602
~ <i>Redemption songs</i>

206
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,170
~ <i>Is all I ever had...</i>

207
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,840
Singing Bob Marley?

208
00:15:18,884 --> 00:15:20,078
No.

209
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,318
Why? You like Bob Marley?

210
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,357
Man, who doesn't like Bob Marley?

211
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,962
[Shannon sighs]

212
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:18,241
Damn it!

213
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,012
Do you really need all that?

214
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,411
Yeah. l do.

215
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,449
Why do you have to bring so much?

216
00:16:24,516 --> 00:16:26,177
Don't you have a hike to lead?

217
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,518
l'm fine.

218
00:16:33,692 --> 00:16:35,523
These belonged to your brother.

219
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,532
l need these things.

220
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:46,298
l can't just leave them.

221
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,200
What are we doing?

222
00:16:52,277 --> 00:16:53,335
Hiding?

223
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,508
As if they won't find us.

224
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:57,378
[sobbing] lt's just...

225
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,049
lt's too much.

226
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,715
lt's too much.

227
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:08,458
lt won't be too much
if l carry it for you.

228
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,664
Now come on.

229
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,490
l have a hike to lead.

230
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:29,980
You okay?

231
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,718
That was messed up.

232
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,385
Yeah.

233
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,018
He just...

234
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:44,229
...exploded...

235
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,864
...in front of us.

236
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,198
He was just trying to help.

237
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:57,805
This is because l came.

238
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,540
What?

239
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:04,347
l'm...

240
00:18:05,617 --> 00:18:08,518
...kind of bad luck.

241
00:18:11,223 --> 00:18:12,588
Hey...

242
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,619
lt was an accident.

243
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:23,935
An accident.

244
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,162
Yeah.

245
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,186
Locke.

246
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,291
We should think about this.

247
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,592
All right.

248
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,635
Maybe this isn't the best way.

249
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:00,869
lt's the only way, Jack.

250
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:41,139
- How many do we need to blow the hatch?
- Two should take care of the hinge.

251
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:45,375
- Three to be safe.
- Safe. [scoffs]

252
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:51,987
l'm removing the driest pieces
to minimize our risk transporting it.

253

You ever play Operation?

254
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,028
Sure. ''Don't touch the sides.''

...on the funny bone.

Bzzzz!

260
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,192
You like to play games, John?

261
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,765
Absolutely.

262
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:41,127
[Charlie] Okay.

so l've solved the
Turnip-Head transport issue.

265
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:49,912
This is, uh, just a blanket
from the plane.

266
00:20:49,982 --> 00:20:54,248
And then, this piece of wood here
that goes through this bamboo.

267
00:20:54,853 --> 00:20:56,047
Here you go.

268
00:20:56,888 --> 00:20:57,912

There's no time!
Where is Sayid?

280
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,242
All right, just calm down.
l'll get him for you.

281
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:27,716
- Stay here, all right?
- Okay.

282
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,775
That's okay.

283
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,149
[Charlie] Sayid! Sayid!

284
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,492

Oh, l haven't named him yet.

290
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:51,733
May l hold him?

291
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:55,241
Um, why do you need Sayid?

292
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,914
You don't want me to hold him?

293
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:03,017
[stammering] No, l just fed him.
l don't think it's a good idea. Okay?

Last night in the bar,

Fine. l'm a huge fan.

313
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,454

You're pathetic.

You're pathetic!

ls he all right?

341
00:25:06,938 --> 00:25:10,669
- [Sayid] Rousseau. Was she alone?
- Did she take my baby?

342
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:11,970
Which way did she go?

343
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:15,376
l don't know!
She took my baby!

344
00:25:16,114 --> 00:25:18,639
This is your fault!
You brought her into the camp!

345
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:19,877
lf you had given me a gun. . .

346
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:22,586
Do not hit me again.

347
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,785
You want to waste time
assigning blame?

348
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,620
There's plenty to go around.

349
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:30,922
She has a head start.
lf we leave now, we can catch her.

350
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,327
How we gonna do that?

351
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:34,331
Because l know where she's going.

353
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,210
l can carry
all the sticks in my pack.

354
00:25:49,748 --> 00:25:52,080
The more insulation we stuff in,
the better.

355
00:25:53,618 --> 00:25:55,210
l think we should split 'em up.

356
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:56,976
What?

357
00:25:57,055 --> 00:26:00,218
lt's not smart to keep it all together,
so we split 'em up.

358
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:02,453
lf we need three sticks
to blow the hinge,

359
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:03,858
then we should bring six.

360
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,323
Three and three.

361
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,128
A fail-safe.
ln case one of us...

362
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,327
You and me then.

363
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:14,370
No. l'm taking one.

364
00:26:16,341 --> 00:26:17,365
Not gonna happen.

365
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:18,602
This is why l came.

366
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:20,702
- You wasted a trip.
- l need to do this.

367
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,339
Kate, no one owes
anyone anything.

368
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,076
- l'm carrying one.
- We're done.

369
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:26,913
- This is not your decision.
- lt is.

370
00:26:26,985 --> 00:26:28,452
We'll draw straws.

371
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:34,184
They're coming. We don't have time to
argue about who risks their life, so...

372
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,521
- ...we let fate decide.
- Works for me.

373
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:43,993
- What about you?
- You wanna carry some dynamite?

374
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:47,493
What?

375
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:52,507
You got some... Arnzt on you.

376
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:00,885
Short sticks carry the packs.

377
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,295
Looks like it's you and me, Kate.

378
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:29,807
So, what's this stuff even do?

379
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,611
Well, the transmitter
sends out an SOS

380
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,379
in case someone's listening.

381
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,011
And if there's anything out there,

382
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,318
we'll see it on this
radar screen here.

383
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,426
Here we go.

384
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:52,092
- Come on.
- [beeping]

385
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:54,297
[Michael] Someone, find us.

386
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,770
Those are messages
everybody wrote.

387
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,610
Sure are.

388
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,707
They're private.

389
00:28:06,818 --> 00:28:08,012
Yep.

390
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,619
l for one never knew
how much Tracey

391
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:14,284
missed her hubby
and two kids back in Fresno.

392
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:17,493
Yet she's sleeping
next to good ol' Scott

393
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,052
to keep her warm at night.

394
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,256
That's Steve. Scott's dead.

395
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:22,822
Whatever.

396
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:26,132
Long ride, Kazoo.
We gotta keep ourselves entertained.

397
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:28,930
Who the hell is Hugo
and how's he got

398
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:31,805
a hundred and sixty million dollars
to leave to his mom?

399
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,810
How'd you like it if l read yours?

400
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:36,505
You can't 'cause l didn't write one.

401
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:38,705
Why not?

402
00:28:38,783 --> 00:28:42,480
'Cause the only letter l ever wrote
is to the man l'm gonna kill.

403
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,989
- Why you gonna kill him?
- 'Cause l need to.

404
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,185
- Why?
- Because.

405
00:28:57,335 --> 00:28:59,064
[Charlie] Are you bloody joking?

406
00:28:59,137 --> 00:29:02,595
Why would she go for the black smoke?
lsn't that where the others are?

407
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,733
The others are why
she would go there.

408
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,010
Rousseau told us
she saw black smoke

409
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,478
the day her own child
was taken 1 6 years ago.

410
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:12,541
They took something from her.

411
00:29:12,617 --> 00:29:16,576
And now she believes...
she has something they want.

412
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:20,214
- She's making a trade?
- l believe she is. Yes.

413
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:22,452
That's insane. She's insane.

414
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:26,293
Don't apply reason to her actions.
She's a mother who lost her child.

415
00:29:26,364 --> 00:29:27,388
Just like Claire.

416
00:29:30,802 --> 00:29:32,736
This isn't about revenge.

417
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:34,668
Don't make it personal.

418
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,308
[shouting]

419
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,404
l'm coming with you.

420
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,742
That's not a good idea.

421
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,409
This is my baby, okay.
l let her take him.

422
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:49,112
- Claire, listen.
- Don't tell me what to do!

423
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,279
Calm down.

424
00:29:50,355 --> 00:29:53,381
[sobbing] l am coming with you.
This is my fault and l'm coming

425
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:54,652
and you can't stop me!

426
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,427
lt's fine, all right.
lt's all right.

427
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,429
[sobbing] l'm supposed to raise him.

428
00:30:06,704 --> 00:30:08,467
Get him back, Charlie.

429
00:30:10,375 --> 00:30:12,605
Get Aaron back.

430
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,239
Aaron?

431
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,606
Please.

432
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,205
Get him back. Please.

433
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:21,616
Claire, l will get him back.

434
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,914
Promise.

435
00:30:38,603 --> 00:30:41,868
<i>[PA announcer]</i>

436
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:45,369
Hey, you want something to eat?

437
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,569
<i>[video game beeping]</i>

438
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:52,810
l guess that's a ''no'' then.

439
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:05,126
lf you're worried about Vincent,
he's gonna be okay, man.

440
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:08,097
Dogs fly in the luggage compartment
all the time.

441
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:14,327
All right.

442
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,569
l gotta call work.

443
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:19,676
Right over there.

444
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:22,308
Don't go anywhere, okay?

445
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:31,581
No, l live in a studio apartment.

446
00:31:31,656 --> 00:31:34,557
l gotta be out the door
in the morning for work by 5am.

447
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:38,084
Who's gonna watch him? How's he
getting to school? What about after?

448
00:31:38,162 --> 00:31:40,221
l can't do this, Ma.

449
00:31:42,667 --> 00:31:43,691
You know, l was...

450
00:31:45,470 --> 00:31:47,233
Listen, l was thinking, um...

451
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:52,032
l was thinking maybe
you could take him.

452
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,240
But Ma,
if it's a question of money, l...

453
00:31:57,682 --> 00:31:59,707
[sighs]

454
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,186
What am l supposed to do with him?
He's not supposed to be mine.

455
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,521
This was never part of the plan.

456
00:32:14,999 --> 00:32:16,364
Yeah, l...

457
00:32:18,336 --> 00:32:19,803
Thanks, Ma.

458
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:34,482
Hey, man.

459
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:37,821
- l was, uh...
- l need new batteries.

460
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,529
Hey.

461
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:48,827
- You wanna try?
- What?

462
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,889
Come on, come here.

463
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,300
- You drive for awhile.
- Really?

464
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:54,804
Absolutely.
Okay, now. Look.

465
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,432
The most important part
of this boat is the rudder.

466
00:32:57,508 --> 00:32:58,873
lt's how you steer.

467
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,776
You turn it gradually.
Nothing sharp, okay?

468
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,279
Push it this way.

469
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,046
Where are we going?

470
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,211
Look.

471
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:13,783
So we're going approximately
north by northeast.

472
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,622
So hopefully that puts us
into a shipping lane.

473
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,955
Or we hit some land.

474
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,654
What do l aim for?

475
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,463
See that cloud on the horizon?

476
00:33:24,535 --> 00:33:26,002
- Right there?
- Yeah.

477
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:28,969
You aim for that.

478
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,496
Yep.

479
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,270
- Okay.
- Got it.

480
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,246
How come you and my mom
didn't stay together?

481
00:33:43,654 --> 00:33:44,951
We tried.

482
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,322
lt just didn't work out.
So our lives, our interests

483
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,692
just went in different directions.

484
00:33:53,097 --> 00:33:55,031
How come l never saw you?

485
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,066
'Cause your mom didn't want me to.

486
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:05,036
She did what she thought was best.

487
00:34:07,445 --> 00:34:09,310
She was wrong.

488
00:34:11,616 --> 00:34:13,481

00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,918

- [Michael] Hey, we hit a log.

490
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,422
- We lost the rudder.
- [Jin] Rudder. Rudder.

491
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,084
[Michael] We're losing it!
lt's sinking! Stop the boat.

492
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:25,656
Stop the boat!
Just pull the sail down.

493
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,524
Right.

494
00:34:29,967 --> 00:34:31,161
Dad!

495
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:34,499
Sawyer!

496
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:41,802
Sawyer!
Give me the rope. Throw it.

- Sawyer!
- [Sawyer] lt's sinking.

- [speaking Korean]

and we'll pull you in!

503
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:23,676
Okay.

Michael. Michael. [speaks Korean]

505
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,592
Got it. Come on.

506
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:39,396
Come on, buddy.

507
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:45,701
[panting]

508
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,075
You just saved our ass, buddy.

509
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,011
Here's your shirt.

510
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,020
You should put that
back on before you burn.

511
00:36:16,774 --> 00:36:17,798
Sorry.

512
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:19,742
Yeah, well...

513
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,606
lt's the luck of the draw.

514
00:36:23,281 --> 00:36:25,681
Sun sets in 90 minutes,
give or take.

515
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,378
lf we want to get back
to the hatch, we have to hustle.

516
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,579
Okay, this is how we do this.

517
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:33,123
l'll lead.
Kate, you're right behind me.

518
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,625
Then Hurley.
John, you bring up the rear.

519
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,390
- lf you see me heading the wrong way...
- We should stagger our formation.

520
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:41,328
Keep a safe distance
from each other.

521
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:44,460
All right. We stagger.

522
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,302
lf anyone hears
anything or sees anything...

523
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,999
Like the security system
that eats people?

524
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,406
Yeah. Like that.

525
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,570
You two, you take your packs off,
you put 'em down and you run.

526
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,477
- You got it?
- Got it.

527
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,742
Yes, sir.

528
00:37:01,152 --> 00:37:02,414
Okay.

529
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,148

Do you think
we're being punished?

539
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,372
Punished for what?

540
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,944
Things we did before.

541
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,206
The secrets we kept.

542
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,586
The lies we told.

543
00:38:47,458 --> 00:38:49,892
Who do you think
is punishing us?

544
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:55,792
Fate.

545
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,834
[Claire] No one's punishing us.

546
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,832
No such thing as fate.

547

Are you okay?

548

Where did it come from?

562
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:32,561
Based on the maps inside, Nigeria.

563

- Anyone onboard?
- Two men, dressed as priests.

564

- Priests?
- Drug runners in disguise.

565
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,410
The plane was loaded with heroin.

All right.

Nope.

- That number? 23?

The guy who called the feds on me
back in Australia

Nah. lt's just a number.

00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:02,168
Better catch up.
l can barely see 'em.

762
00:58:14,090 --> 00:58:16,650
We shouldn't be this close
to each other, Jack.

lf we blow up, we blow up.

764

about back there?

- You asked to let you go.

00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,325
That's right.

767
00:58:27,404 --> 00:58:29,338
That thing was
taking you down the hole.

- lt wasn't gonna hurt me.
- lt was gonna kill you.

769
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:33,969

Look, l need for you to...

771
00:58:36,246 --> 00:58:39,807
l need for you to explain to me what
the hell's going on inside your head.

772

l need to know why you believe
that thing wasn't gonna...

773
00:58:42,686 --> 00:58:46,452
- l believe that l was being tested.
- Tested.

774
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,650
Yeah. Tested.

775
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:53,660
l think that's why you and l
don't see eye to eye sometimes, Jack.

776
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,722
- Because you're a man of science.
- Yeah.

777
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,428
- And what does that make you?
- Me?

778
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:01,663
Well, l'm a man of faith.

779
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,637
Do you really think
all this is an accident?

780
00:59:08,612 --> 00:59:10,705
That we, a group of strangers,
survived.

781
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:14,147
Many of us with
just superficial injuries.

782
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:19,018
You think we crashed on this place
by coincidence? Especially this place.

783
00:59:19,089 --> 00:59:22,991
We were brought here for a purpose.
For a reason. All of us.

784
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:27,052
Each one of us
was brought here for a reason.

785
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:29,157
Brought here?

786
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,168
And who brought us here, John?

787
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,362
The island.

788
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:37,304
The island brought us here.

789
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:41,034
This is no ordinary place.
You've seen that, l know you have.

790
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:45,241
The island chose you too, Jack.

791
00:59:46,216 --> 00:59:48,013
lt's destiny.

792
00:59:50,453 --> 00:59:53,217
Did you talk with Boone
about destiny, John?

793
00:59:57,761 --> 01:00:01,288
Boone was a sacrifice
that the island demanded.

794
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,171
What happened to him at that plane
was a part of a chain of events

795
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,834
that led us here,
that led us down a path,

796
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:16,640
that led you and me to this day,
to right now.

797
01:00:19,215 --> 01:00:21,445
And where's that path end, John?

798
01:00:21,952 --> 01:00:23,749
The path ends at the hatch.

799
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:29,085
The hatch, Jack. All of it. All of it
happened so we can open the hatch.

800
01:00:29,159 --> 01:00:32,595
No. No, we're opening the hatch
so that we can survive.

801
01:00:33,730 --> 01:00:36,665
Survival is all relative, Jack.

Look, we're 1 5 miles out.
We could be here for weeks.

The way he runs around,
does whatever the hell he wants.

the back of my hand a long time ago.

- Hell of a lot cheaper than a shrink.

ls that what your father did to you?
Show you the back of his hand?

My daddy never got
a chance to beat me.

on this raft, l couldn't figure it out.

You're pathetic.

883
01:09:22,592 --> 01:09:23,718
Wire.

884
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:34,331
Hold that end.

885
01:09:49,752 --> 01:09:50,878
Now the fuse.

l'll do it.

887
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:41,494
- That's as far as it goes.
- lt's far enough.

888
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,903
l'll light it. You take cover.

889
01:10:43,973 --> 01:10:46,965
There'll be enough
burn time for me to get clear.

890
01:10:47,510 --> 01:10:50,707
- Hurley!
- [Hurley] Wait. Just a sec.

891
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,581
What was that
about back there?

892
01:11:03,559 --> 01:11:05,789
What was what about?

893
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:09,092
Putting the dynamite in your pack.

894
01:11:09,165 --> 01:11:12,692
- l made a judgment call.
- We drew straws.

895
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:15,760
l'm not gonna let drawing straws
make decisions like that.

896
01:11:15,838 --> 01:11:17,203
You had no right.

897
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:20,709
Everybody wants me to be a leader
till l make a decision they don't like.

898
01:11:20,776 --> 01:11:23,540
You want to keep second guessing me?
That's your call.

899
01:11:24,413 --> 01:11:26,278
There's something you need to know.

900
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,544
lf we survive this,
if we survive tonight...

901

...we're gonna
have a Locke problem.

902
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:42,725
And l have to know
that you've got my back.

903
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:46,424
l got your back.

904
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,996
[Locke] Are we ready?

905
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:53,132
[Hurley] Wait a sec. Wait a sec.

907
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:12,852
No, no, no.

Stop, don't light it!
We can't do this!

We can't do this!
Stop! What are you...?

913
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:32,477
We gotta stop it.
The numbers are bad.

914
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,746
What are you doing?
Why'd you do that?

915
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:41,149
Wait! The numbers are bad!
The numbers are bad!

916
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,020
- The numbers are bad!
- [Jack] Stop!

917
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44,957
- No, we can't!

918
01:12:45,027 --> 01:12:46,892
- Get back!
- We can't. The numbers...
