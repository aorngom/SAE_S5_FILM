1
00:00:14,601 --> 00:00:16,238
Would you put your seat back, please?

2
00:00:18,375 --> 00:00:20,301
Would you fasten your seat belt, please?

3
00:00:21,258 --> 00:00:22,503
Excuse me. Excuse me.

4
00:00:24,338 --> 00:00:26,135
Can I get another one of those, please?

5
00:00:26,366 --> 00:00:28,714
I'm sorry, sir.
We'll be landing in 20 minutes.

6
00:00:29,011 --> 00:00:30,558
Well, 20 minutes is a long time.

7
00:00:30,854 --> 00:00:32,393
How about a newspaper instead?

8
00:00:32,798 --> 00:00:35,041
And if you could buckle
your seat belt, sir...

9
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:48,863
<i>Sorry about the bumps, folks.</i>

10
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:52,257
<i>We're just hitting a little warm air
as we make our descent into Los Angeles.</i>

11
00:00:52,422 --> 00:00:53,988
<i>Please keep those seat belts fastened,</i>

12
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:55,963
<i>and we'll have you
on the ground shortly.</i>

13
00:02:18,498 --> 00:02:19,498
It's me.

14
00:02:21,311 --> 00:02:22,311
I...

15
00:02:25,824 --> 00:02:26,935
I just read...

16
00:03:38,388 --> 00:03:39,686
Forgive me.

17
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,435
Mom! Mom!

18
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:54,686
Help!

19
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,764
You have everything you need?

20
00:04:24,893 --> 00:04:27,251
No, but I made the best out
of what we have.

21
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:31,185
Bernard and Jin?

22
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,902
They're both excellent shots
and highly motivated.

23
00:04:36,953 --> 00:04:38,978
The dynamite's in place. We won't miss.

24
00:04:40,929 --> 00:04:43,464
No matter what happens here,
I want you to keep moving.

25
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:45,296
Keep moving for that radio tower.

26
00:04:45,797 --> 00:04:47,428
Don't turn back for any reason.

27
00:04:49,234 --> 00:04:51,752
I'm willing to give my life
if it means securing rescue,

28
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:53,877
but I'm not giving it up for nothing.

29
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:56,109
You understand?

30
00:05:03,034 --> 00:05:04,109
I understand.

31
00:05:09,274 --> 00:05:10,355
Then good luck.

32
00:05:11,895 --> 00:05:12,982
You, too.

33
00:05:21,369 --> 00:05:23,917
If I told you that I'd help you
with your "S.O.S." sign,

34
00:05:24,044 --> 00:05:25,353
would you change your mind?

35
00:05:26,185 --> 00:05:27,296
No, ma'am.

36
00:05:27,989 --> 00:05:29,281
I want you to say it again.

37
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:30,947
Say it, Bernard.

38
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:33,483
I am a dentist.

39
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:34,984
I am not Rambo.

40
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,373
And don't you forget it.

41
00:05:54,515 --> 00:05:55,783
Charlie's gonna be fine.

42
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:58,269
Yeah. Of course he is.

43
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:22,659
Because...

44
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:25,656
we have... to go... home.

45
00:06:43,373 --> 00:06:44,442
Alright.

46
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:47,655
Let's do it.

47
00:07:27,236 --> 00:07:39,551
Subtitles: swsub.com

48
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:07,049
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

49
00:08:07,555 --> 00:08:09,844
What did you do for a living
before you became Moses?

50
00:08:11,785 --> 00:08:12,785
I was a doctor.

51
00:08:12,987 --> 00:08:14,300
Right. 'course you were.

52
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,046
Well, I need your attention
for a minute, doctor.

53
00:08:20,098 --> 00:08:21,098
Is she okay?

54
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,590
Why wouldn't she be?

55
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:27,532
Because none of your people
trusts her. No offense.

56
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:30,295
Why don't you catch up to me
when you're done?

57
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:32,233
It's fine.

58
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:38,227
So I need to show you
how this wonderful gadget works

59
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:39,916
in case anything happens to me.

60
00:08:40,773 --> 00:08:42,429
You need to be able to call my boat.

61
00:08:43,725 --> 00:08:44,899
Okay. Show me.

62
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:46,201
It's actually simple.

63
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,350
Turn her on here.

64
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:49,835
This opens a direct channel
to the freighter.

65
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,462
Give her a tap here.

66
00:08:51,817 --> 00:08:53,543
Wait for the beep and say hello.

67
00:08:54,723 --> 00:08:55,981
- That's it?
- That's it.

68
00:08:56,597 --> 00:08:59,923
Once the rock star turns off whatever
underwater contraption is jamming us up,

69
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,119
this red light will turn
a lovely shade of green.

70
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:05,364
That'll be any time now, yeah?

71
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:07,849
Hopefully.

72
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:22,008
Who are you?

73
00:09:23,336 --> 00:09:25,838
If you tell us how you got down here,
we won't hurt you.

74
00:09:28,822 --> 00:09:30,558
I came in my invisible submarine.

75
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:31,695
Don't you see it?

76
00:09:33,432 --> 00:09:35,922
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy? He's one of them.

77
00:09:37,593 --> 00:09:38,750
Why are you here?

78
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:41,575
How did you find out about this station?

79
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:45,439
Juliet told us.

80
00:09:47,407 --> 00:09:48,564
She's one of us now...

81
00:09:49,656 --> 00:09:50,927
In case you haven't heard.

82
00:09:55,282 --> 00:09:56,282
We gotta call Ben.

83
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:00,970
Let's call Ben.

84
00:10:04,393 --> 00:10:05,426
Come on.

85
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:20,485
<i>You're inside a room full of equipment.</i>

86
00:10:21,092 --> 00:10:23,878
There's a blinking yellow light
above a switch.

87
00:10:24,672 --> 00:10:25,783
<i>You flick the switch.</i>

88
00:10:26,345 --> 00:10:27,345
Light goes off.

89
00:10:29,908 --> 00:10:30,908
And you drown.

90
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:46,383
<i>It's Bonnie.</i>

91
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:48,409
<i>Ben, are you there?</i>

92
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:50,617
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

93
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:55,621
Why are you breaking radio silence?

94
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:57,109
One of them's down here.

95
00:10:57,509 --> 00:10:58,542
I'm sorry. What?

96
00:10:58,683 --> 00:11:00,579
<i>We've got him tied up, but he's here.</i>

97
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:02,160
<i>One of them swam down here.</i>

98
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:03,522
Who? Which one?

99
00:11:03,782 --> 00:11:04,782
He won't tell us.

100
00:11:05,035 --> 00:11:06,035
It's Charlie!

101
00:11:06,502 --> 00:11:07,547
<i>Tell him I said hi!</i>

102
00:11:08,346 --> 00:11:09,346
How did...

103
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:11,475
<i>How does he know about the station.</i>

104
00:11:11,597 --> 00:11:13,135
He said Juliet told them.

105
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:24,110
All right, sit tight. Don't do anything.
I'm sending help.

106
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,019
You need to go down
to the Looking Glass

107
00:11:27,141 --> 00:11:29,202
and find out what Charlie Pace
is doing down there.

108
00:11:29,324 --> 00:11:31,980
You told us the Looking Glass
was inoperable... flooded.

109
00:11:33,346 --> 00:11:34,346
I lied.

110
00:11:35,222 --> 00:11:37,138
Mikhail, I need you to go now!

111
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:39,794
I can be there by dawn.

112
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:43,934
But if Juliet told them
about the Looking Glass,

113
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,519
what else did she tell them?

114
00:11:53,074 --> 00:11:54,074
Ryan, come in.

115
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:55,926
Ryan, are you there?

116
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,870
Are your walkies all off?

117
00:12:09,014 --> 00:12:10,021
Yes, sir.

118
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:13,351
Did you get a good look?

119
00:12:13,536 --> 00:12:15,837
The tents are marked with white coral
... three of 'em.

120
00:12:16,135 --> 00:12:17,199
Juliet did her job.

121
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:19,138
Alright. Let's do this.

122
00:13:16,786 --> 00:13:17,866
It's empty!

123
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:19,877
Get away from the tent!

124
00:13:23,448 --> 00:13:25,133
- It's a trap! Move!
- Please, God.

125
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:29,855
Move, move!

126
00:13:32,246 --> 00:13:33,314
The tree line!

127
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:47,591
I got your man!

128
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,355
Drop your weapons!

129
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:01,168
I got your man!

130
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:04,291
It's over!

131
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:07,544
Don't.

132
00:14:07,777 --> 00:14:09,063
Finger off the trigger.

133
00:14:19,094 --> 00:14:23,075
There were supposed
to be three explosions.

134
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:31,873
It didn't work.

135
00:14:41,654 --> 00:14:43,342
There you go. Good as new.

136
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:44,990
Thanks.

137
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:47,198
The news people
are waiting for you outside,

138
00:14:47,543 --> 00:14:48,906
you being a hero and all.

139
00:14:49,779 --> 00:14:50,843
Right.

140
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:54,123
The woman... how is she?

141
00:14:55,029 --> 00:14:56,186
She's been stabilized.

142
00:14:56,844 --> 00:14:58,467
Thank God you were on that bridge.

143
00:15:01,614 --> 00:15:03,328
- Sorry.
- No visitors in E.R.

144
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,009
It's okay.

145
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,699
She's...

146
00:15:10,948 --> 00:15:12,105
We used to be married.

147
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,761
Come on in.

148
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:19,760
What happened?

149
00:15:22,447 --> 00:15:23,511
There was...

150
00:15:26,362 --> 00:15:27,449
a car accident.

151
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,761
Are you okay?

152
00:15:33,716 --> 00:15:34,819
Yeah, I'm fine.

153
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:37,945
Were you drinking again?

154
00:15:41,546 --> 00:15:42,708
- Are you, Jack?
- No.

155
00:15:47,198 --> 00:15:48,987
Why did you come down here, Sarah?

156
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,041
I'm still listed
as your emergency contact.

157
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:02,964
What were you doing
driving around at 2:00 in the morning?

158
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:24,567
Maybe you could give me a lift home?

159
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,509
I don't think that would be appropriate.

160
00:16:36,197 --> 00:16:37,197
Well...

161
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:41,963
Thanks for coming down, Sarah.

162
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:45,138
Good-bye, Jack.

163
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:02,821
Why were there only two explosions?

164
00:17:03,514 --> 00:17:05,306
Maybe they didn't have to blow
the 3rd tent.

165
00:17:05,428 --> 00:17:07,127
But those gunshots...
What was that about?

166
00:17:07,249 --> 00:17:08,890
- He's okay.
- Do you believe that?

167
00:17:09,012 --> 00:17:11,786
Listen, they had no idea
that we were waiting for them,

168
00:17:12,845 --> 00:17:14,109
and Sayid's with your husbands.

169
00:17:14,231 --> 00:17:17,034
They're gonna be fine, and they're gonna
be a couple hours behind us.

170
00:17:17,156 --> 00:17:18,825
We should wait for them here.
You go...

171
00:17:18,947 --> 00:17:21,230
No. No one gets left behind.

172
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:23,885
If you say,
"live together, die alone" to me,

173
00:17:24,026 --> 00:17:25,622
I'm gonna punch you in your face.

174
00:17:27,761 --> 00:17:28,761
Fair enough, Rose.

175
00:17:29,701 --> 00:17:30,701
Fair enough.

176
00:17:31,823 --> 00:17:33,180
But we have a plan!

177
00:17:34,279 --> 00:17:35,592
And for all we know, it worked.

178
00:17:37,606 --> 00:17:40,092
It's gonna be okay.
Everything is gonna be all right.

179
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,568
Let's just keep moving, okay?

180
00:17:55,673 --> 00:17:56,754
It's okay. Let's go.

181
00:18:05,694 --> 00:18:07,637
I'm gonna ask you this one more time.

182
00:18:08,858 --> 00:18:09,858
Why are you here?

183
00:18:12,856 --> 00:18:16,239
I'm here...
to turn off your jamming equipment.

184
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:19,847
In there,
next to the flashing yellow light.

185
00:18:20,292 --> 00:18:22,981
- Now how'd you know about that?
- I know because I know.

186
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:26,668
Whatever you ladies do to me,
I'm going to turn it off.

187
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:28,610
- You are, huh?
- Most definitely am.

188
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,732
So what's the code?

189
00:18:31,671 --> 00:18:32,671
What?

190
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,492
If you're gonna turn off
the jamming equipment,

191
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,785
you're gonna need the code,

192
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:38,720
and only three people know it.

193
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:41,221
Me, her and Ben.

194
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:48,795
Well...

195
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,170
Guess I won't need the code...

196
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:53,955
Since this entire station's
gonna be flooded anyway.

197
00:18:57,677 --> 00:18:59,291
Now just turn off your little jammer,

198
00:18:59,436 --> 00:19:01,738
and the helicopters come
and rescue all my friends.

199
00:19:02,482 --> 00:19:04,293
But if this station floods,

200
00:19:05,389 --> 00:19:06,645
what happens to you?

201
00:19:10,209 --> 00:19:11,296
I die.

202
00:19:18,518 --> 00:19:20,114
- What?
<i>- They're all dead…</i>

203
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:22,468
<i>Diane, Ivan. All of them… dead.</i>

204
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,542
<i>It's Shephard and his people…
They're gone!</i>

205
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:25,869
Gone? Gone where?

206
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,818
I don't know. Did you hear me?

207
00:19:28,003 --> 00:19:29,582
They killed seven of us!

208
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:32,037
Calm down and tell him the good news.

209
00:19:32,221 --> 00:19:33,379
What good news?

210
00:19:34,314 --> 00:19:35,570
We caught three of them...

211
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,745
The ones that stayed behind
to blow up the tents.

212
00:19:38,113 --> 00:19:39,642
They knew we were coming.

213
00:19:39,915 --> 00:19:41,002
It was Juliet.

214
00:19:41,753 --> 00:19:42,781
She betrayed us.

215
00:19:43,003 --> 00:19:45,585
- What?
- Just figure out where she is,Tom.

216
00:19:46,814 --> 00:19:47,814
Get up.

217
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,764
Okay, junior, where the hell did...

218
00:19:55,253 --> 00:19:56,305
They're not talking.

219
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:57,448
Who do you have?

220
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:59,771
<i>Jarrah, Kwon and the dentist.</i>

221
00:20:00,305 --> 00:20:01,322
Shoot Kwon.

222
00:20:03,282 --> 00:20:04,376
- What?
<i>- You want them</i>

223
00:20:04,498 --> 00:20:06,080
to answer questions, kill Kwon.

224
00:20:06,202 --> 00:20:07,206
<i>Do it now!</i>

225
00:20:08,445 --> 00:20:11,509
I don't know what that means,
but I'm sure it's lovely.

226
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,431
No, wait, no...

227
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:14,827
- No talk.
- No, please.

228
00:20:15,086 --> 00:20:17,927
Talk to me. Nobody will get hurt.
Now tell me where your people went.

229
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,903
He's lying. He's going to kill us all.

230
00:20:21,735 --> 00:20:23,127
Where are they?

231
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:31,962
The radio tower.

232
00:20:32,674 --> 00:20:34,103
They're hiking to a radio tower.

233
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,135
<i>Why in the hell are they going there?</i>

234
00:20:39,461 --> 00:20:41,375
<i>A woman parachuted here.</i>

235
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:44,723
She has a satellite phone,
and they're gonna call her ship.

236
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,784
Juliet thought we were coming tomorrow,

237
00:20:49,523 --> 00:20:51,375
so why were they waiting for us tonight?

238
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:52,585
You heard him.

239
00:20:53,059 --> 00:20:54,146
How'd you know?

240
00:20:55,961 --> 00:20:56,961
A kid

241
00:20:57,565 --> 00:21:00,794
<i>told us.
He came in a canoe and warned us.</i>

242
00:21:01,522 --> 00:21:02,522
What kid?

243
00:21:03,523 --> 00:21:05,257
Karl. He said his name was Karl.

244
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:07,452
<i>You heard that, Ben?</i>

245
00:21:10,808 --> 00:21:11,808
I heard.

246
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:21,606
<i>What do you want us to do?</i>

247
00:21:21,954 --> 00:21:22,977
Kill them?

248
00:21:25,181 --> 00:21:26,181
No.

249
00:21:26,796 --> 00:21:27,871
Not yet.

250
00:21:36,451 --> 00:21:37,878
We're going to the radio tower?

251
00:21:38,295 --> 00:21:39,382
Not we, Richard. Me.

252
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,548
You're going to take everyone
to the temple as planned.

253
00:21:42,943 --> 00:21:45,605
Now might not be the best time
to go tromping off on your own.

254
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:46,822
Really? And why not?

255
00:21:46,944 --> 00:21:48,648
Because people are asking questions,

256
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:51,407
about leaving home,
about what happened to Locke,

257
00:21:51,568 --> 00:21:52,568
about Jacob.

258
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,946
Not to mention
the rapidly spreading rumor

259
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:58,179
that everyone
who went down to the beach is dead.

260
00:21:58,816 --> 00:22:00,050
They're not all dead.

261
00:22:06,092 --> 00:22:07,243
Where are you going?

262
00:22:10,398 --> 00:22:13,388
- I asked where you were going.
- Well, I thought I might go for a walk,

263
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:15,658
see if I can't find Jack
and all his friends.

264
00:22:17,457 --> 00:22:18,509
I'm coming with you.

265
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:21,083
Alright.

266
00:22:21,931 --> 00:22:23,381
- What?
- I said alright.

267
00:22:24,131 --> 00:22:25,540
In fact, I think it's a good idea.

268
00:22:27,395 --> 00:22:29,590
I mean, you do wanna see Karl again,
don't you?

269
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,918
Get your pack.
I'm leaving in ten minutes.

270
00:22:39,281 --> 00:22:40,286
There're 40 of them,

271
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:42,499
and you're alone.

272
00:22:42,876 --> 00:22:45,271
They're gonna do whatever it takes
to get off the island.

273
00:22:45,575 --> 00:22:47,759
What do you think
is gonna happen when you get there?

274
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:50,921
I'm gonna talk them out of it.

275
00:23:20,197 --> 00:23:21,272
Something's wrong.

276
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:24,401
Lots of things are wrong.

277
00:23:25,019 --> 00:23:27,920
Jin, Bernard, Sayid...
They should've caught up to us by now.

278
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:30,154
I wanna go back to make sure

279
00:23:30,286 --> 00:23:31,872
- they're all right.
- 'course you do.

280
00:23:32,612 --> 00:23:34,616
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means, Kate,

281
00:23:34,738 --> 00:23:36,675
there's always someone to go back for.

282
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,351
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.

283
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:41,486
- Nothing?
- I'm fine.

284
00:23:41,608 --> 00:23:43,721
Why don't you just tell me
what happened?

285
00:23:50,808 --> 00:23:52,581
- What'd you do that for?
- To wake you up.

286
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:56,608
Ever since you got that tape from Lock,
it's like you've been sleepwalking.

287
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,631
You don't care about our friends, fine,

288
00:23:59,753 --> 00:24:02,371
but it's like you don't care
about anything anymore.

289
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:05,914
And since when did you
start calling me "Kate"?

290
00:24:11,205 --> 00:24:12,321
You know...

291
00:24:14,429 --> 00:24:16,392
They sent Juliet to check out Sun.

292
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:22,407
But she was there to check
and see if I'm pregnant, too.

293
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:28,082
Well, let's hope you're not.

294
00:24:43,563 --> 00:24:44,713
That light still red?

295
00:26:12,869 --> 00:26:14,748
Bloody hell. You all right?

296
00:26:14,998 --> 00:26:17,761
Not for long if you don't
get out of here. You have to hide.

297
00:26:17,901 --> 00:26:19,827
There's people in there.
Quick, hide, hide!

298
00:26:22,029 --> 00:26:23,109
Who's he talking to?

299
00:26:29,217 --> 00:26:30,568
Who were you talking to?

300
00:26:30,762 --> 00:26:32,594
Wasn't talking to anyone.
I was just singing.

301
00:26:45,028 --> 00:26:46,028
Shut up.

302
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:47,999
Right, okay. You got it.

303
00:26:49,701 --> 00:26:50,718
Come on.

304
00:27:30,707 --> 00:27:31,707
Can I help you?

305
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:35,593
Just checking her chart.

306
00:27:35,717 --> 00:27:37,630
I'm sorry. I'm Dr. Hamill... Rob.

307
00:27:37,818 --> 00:27:40,014
The new chief of surgery.
I don't think we've met yet.

308
00:27:41,643 --> 00:27:43,368
Dr. Shephard, the hero...

309
00:27:44,182 --> 00:27:45,269
Twice over.

310
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:48,769
You all right?

311
00:27:48,954 --> 00:27:51,429
After last night,
I'm surprised you'd even wanna come in.

312
00:27:52,827 --> 00:27:54,835
Talk about right place, right time, huh?

313
00:27:55,071 --> 00:27:56,767
This woman is very lucky you were there.

314
00:27:56,889 --> 00:27:59,028
If she was lucky,
she wouldn't have a fractured back

315
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:00,931
that was impinging upon her spinal cord.

316
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:04,569
I'd like to...
operate first thing in the morning.

317
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:07,520
You wanna operate?

318
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,146
Yes.

319
00:28:09,268 --> 00:28:11,135
I'm sorry, but this isn't your patient,

320
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:12,896
and we are well aware of the issues.

321
00:28:13,018 --> 00:28:15,333
Gary Nadler's doing
the surgery at 6:00 a.m.

322
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,986
With all due respect...

323
00:28:22,324 --> 00:28:24,246
Dr. Hamill, I'd rather do it myself.

324
00:28:28,074 --> 00:28:29,131
Last night,

325
00:28:29,425 --> 00:28:31,827
you pulled this woman's 8-year-old son
out of a flaming car,

326
00:28:31,949 --> 00:28:33,258
then you went back for her.

327
00:28:36,387 --> 00:28:37,476
I think you've done enough.

328
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:38,849
I wanna do the surgery.

329
00:28:40,699 --> 00:28:43,355
Look, everything's under control here.

330
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:44,764
She'll be fine.

331
00:28:45,512 --> 00:28:47,358
Go home. Have a drink.

332
00:28:48,053 --> 00:28:49,053
You deserve it.

333
00:28:54,053 --> 00:28:55,316
The chart, please.

334
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,662
You call me.

335
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:08,359
I wanna know what happens.

336
00:29:19,374 --> 00:29:21,009
<i>... was shut down for several hours</i>

337
00:29:21,131 --> 00:29:23,885
<i>in the wake of a fiery car accident
that left two injured.</i>

338
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:27,020
<i>An unidentified
40-year-old woman and her son.</i>

339
00:29:27,553 --> 00:29:28,816
<i>Fortunately for the two of them,</i>

340
00:29:28,938 --> 00:29:31,841
<i>Dr. Jack Shephard was near
the scene of the crash</i>

341
00:29:31,963 --> 00:29:33,953
<i>and pulled both victims
from the burning wreckage</i>

342
00:29:34,073 --> 00:29:36,756
<i>and treated them at the scene
until paramedics arrived.</i>

343
00:29:37,126 --> 00:29:39,919
<i>The victims were later transported
to St. Sebastian hospital.</i>

344
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:42,956
<i>Further details of their conditions
have not yet been released.</i>

345
00:29:53,377 --> 00:29:54,441
I'm going back.

346
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,981
- What?
- I'm going back to the beach.

347
00:29:58,437 --> 00:29:59,975
No way. We keep moving.

348
00:30:00,315 --> 00:30:01,683
I ain't asking permission.

349
00:30:09,068 --> 00:30:10,712
Look, you got a job to do here.

350
00:30:10,938 --> 00:30:12,811
I ain't gonna stand in your way
of doing it,

351
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,342
but you sure as hell don't need me.

352
00:30:15,485 --> 00:30:17,152
What do you think you're gonna get done,

353
00:30:17,316 --> 00:30:18,455
alone and unarmed?

354
00:30:18,874 --> 00:30:20,668
He won't be alone. I'll go with him.

355
00:30:25,479 --> 00:30:27,566
20 mins ago,
you weren't even interested in going,

356
00:30:27,688 --> 00:30:28,697
and now all of a sudden

357
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:31,260
- you're telling Jack...
- I didn't wanna go with you.

358
00:30:35,017 --> 00:30:36,566
It's a suicide mission without guns.

359
00:30:36,855 --> 00:30:38,428
I know where there are some guns.

360
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:41,472
There's a hidden cache
a couple of miles from here.

361
00:30:41,594 --> 00:30:44,024
I can take us back to the beach
on a route past it.

362
00:30:44,974 --> 00:30:46,688
Juliet, you don't have to do that.

363
00:30:47,604 --> 00:30:49,771
Yeah, Jack, I kinda do.

364
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:00,354
Let's do this.

365
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:07,484
Don't do anything stupid.

366
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,649
I won't if you won't.

367
00:31:20,035 --> 00:31:21,228
Don't wait up.

368
00:31:40,495 --> 00:31:42,103
I told you to shut up!

369
00:31:42,296 --> 00:31:44,293
You know how you get a tune stuck
in your head?

370
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,434
This song...
It just started coming to me.

371
00:31:46,645 --> 00:31:47,709
It's almost finished.

372
00:31:47,831 --> 00:31:49,052
Just need to find the bridge.

373
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,776
Get the speargun.

374
00:31:50,898 --> 00:31:52,710
- What? Why?
- 'Cause I want it to hurt.

375
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,171
- No, Ben said we...
- You don't wanna get it? I will.

376
00:31:59,574 --> 00:32:00,713
No. I'll... I'll shut up!

377
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,832
I thought you two
were on assignment in Canada.

378
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,893
He made us promise not to tell anyone.

379
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:22,655
- Hello again.
- Where is the other one?

380
00:32:22,961 --> 00:32:25,742
- What?
- This idiot swam down from a boat.

381
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:27,966
I was just shooting at his friend.

382
00:32:28,962 --> 00:32:30,016
He dove down here.

383
00:32:30,138 --> 00:32:32,120
- He's alone.
- Are you sure about that?

384
00:32:33,923 --> 00:32:36,029
Here's a better question
to ask, Cyclops.

385
00:32:36,151 --> 00:32:38,670
Why did your little friend Ben
tell you people

386
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,351
that this entire station
was flooded when it isn't?

387
00:32:41,983 --> 00:32:45,290
Or, why these two have been
jamming transmissions off the island?

388
00:32:46,158 --> 00:32:47,285
What?

389
00:32:48,318 --> 00:32:49,318
Is that true?

390
00:32:51,028 --> 00:32:52,600
- That's Ben.
- I'll get it.

391
00:32:59,257 --> 00:33:02,540
You have to understand.
Everything I did, I did for the island.

392
00:33:02,945 --> 00:33:05,962
The island told you it was necessary
for you to jam your own people?

393
00:33:06,173 --> 00:33:09,333
Yes, it did.
You've always been a loyalist, Mikhail.

394
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:11,040
Now I'm asking you to trust me,

395
00:33:11,298 --> 00:33:13,717
<i>to trust Jacob who told me to do that.</i>

396
00:33:14,052 --> 00:33:16,389
Why would Jacob ask you
to lie to your own people?

397
00:33:16,734 --> 00:33:18,607
Because this island is under assault

398
00:33:18,729 --> 00:33:21,056
by forces stronger
than anything it's had to deal with

399
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:24,043
in many, many years,
and we are meant to protect it,

400
00:33:24,609 --> 00:33:26,294
by any means necessary.

401
00:33:26,734 --> 00:33:29,066
The jamming was for everyone's security.

402
00:33:30,158 --> 00:33:32,823
We are in a serious situation here.

403
00:33:35,238 --> 00:33:36,945
So why not trust me?

404
00:33:37,687 --> 00:33:38,798
I made a mistake.

405
00:33:39,971 --> 00:33:42,178
I should have told you, and I apologize.

406
00:33:45,613 --> 00:33:46,881
Mikhail, are you still there?

407
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:53,924
Yes.

408
00:33:56,922 --> 00:33:58,122
I need you to help me.

409
00:34:00,385 --> 00:34:03,273
I need you to help me clean up
this mess that I've made.

410
00:34:05,985 --> 00:34:07,529
I need you to kill Charlie.

411
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:13,024
<i>Make sure that the jamming mechanism
continues to function at all cost.</i>

412
00:34:13,812 --> 00:34:16,810
And we can't risk Greta and Bonnie
telling the others what we've done,

413
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:18,735
so you'll have to take care
of them, too.

414
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:26,732
How do I know you didn't say
the same thing to them about me?

415
00:34:28,233 --> 00:34:29,706
Because if I had, Mikhail...

416
00:34:30,608 --> 00:34:31,765
you'd already be dead.

417
00:34:47,241 --> 00:34:50,379
Out of those polar bear cages
and put us on the chain gang,

418
00:34:51,112 --> 00:34:53,814
what the hell did you have us
breaking all those rocks for, anyway?

419
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:55,330
We were building a runway.

420
00:34:56,087 --> 00:34:57,432
A runway? For what?

421
00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:59,523
The aliens.

422
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:02,964
I don't know what for.

423
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:04,777
Do you think they told me everything?

424
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:06,425
Yeah, yeah, whatever you say.

425
00:35:08,843 --> 00:35:10,276
So you screwing Jack yet?

426
00:35:10,587 --> 00:35:11,932
No. Are you?

427
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:16,435
How far away are these guns?

428
00:35:16,898 --> 00:35:18,055
There aren't any guns.

429
00:35:19,684 --> 00:35:20,712
What?

430
00:35:21,148 --> 00:35:22,819
- I lied.
- You lied.

431
00:35:23,337 --> 00:35:25,442
It was the only way he'd let us go back.

432
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,328
So why are you going back?

433
00:35:34,401 --> 00:35:35,401
Karma.

434
00:35:36,659 --> 00:35:38,352
Why are you going back, James?

435
00:35:43,024 --> 00:35:44,099
Hey, guys! Wait up!

436
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:48,537
What the hell do you want?

437
00:35:48,837 --> 00:35:50,034
I'm coming with you guys.

438
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:52,629
No way. Not a chance.

439
00:35:53,398 --> 00:35:54,450
Come on. I can help.

440
00:35:55,215 --> 00:35:56,741
They're my friends, too, man.

441
00:35:57,273 --> 00:35:58,902
Charlie wouldn't let me go with him,

442
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:02,154
and Jack's too busy leading
to even talk to me.

443
00:36:04,586 --> 00:36:05,954
I just wanna help. Please?

444
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:10,343
For God sakes, Hugo, look at you!

445
00:36:10,892 --> 00:36:12,418
You're just gonna get in the way.

446
00:36:14,274 --> 00:36:15,537
You wanna get us killed?

447
00:36:19,793 --> 00:36:21,003
Come on.

448
00:36:35,907 --> 00:36:37,198
If we head north,

449
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,554
we should get to them
before they reach the tower.

450
00:36:41,255 --> 00:36:42,518
Why did you let me come?

451
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,382
I let you come because
I'm delivering you to your new family.

452
00:36:47,912 --> 00:36:49,967
I let you come because you betrayed me.

453
00:36:51,257 --> 00:36:52,904
You locked Karl in a cage.

454
00:36:53,068 --> 00:36:55,646
You put him in a room
and tried to brainwash him.

455
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,437
I didn't want him to get you pregnant.

456
00:37:00,223 --> 00:37:01,738
I suppose I overreacted.

457
00:37:04,236 --> 00:37:05,317
We'd better get going.

458
00:37:07,324 --> 00:37:08,686
Why do you have to stop them?

459
00:37:09,755 --> 00:37:11,330
Why won't you just let them leave?

460
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,213
Because I can't, Alex.

461
00:38:58,071 --> 00:38:59,193
Don't, John.

462
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:08,023
Put the gun down.

463
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,447
Walt?

464
00:39:13,629 --> 00:39:14,693
Now get up, John.

465
00:39:18,369 --> 00:39:19,875
He shot me, and I can't...

466
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:23,075
move my legs.

467
00:39:23,382 --> 00:39:24,592
You can move your legs.

468
00:39:25,193 --> 00:39:26,548
Now get out of the ditch.

469
00:39:28,444 --> 00:39:29,444
Why?

470
00:39:30,257 --> 00:39:32,050
Because you have work to do.

471
00:39:47,269 --> 00:39:48,269
You okay?

472
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:51,520
Yeah, I just...

473
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,177
got a rock in my shoe.

474
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:05,076
He didt mean it, you know.

475
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:08,268
What?

476
00:40:08,582 --> 00:40:09,582
Sawyer.

477
00:40:10,456 --> 00:40:13,397
When he said that he didn't want you
to go with him... he didn't mean it.

478
00:40:13,831 --> 00:40:15,487
If he didn't mean it, why'd he say it?

479
00:40:17,168 --> 00:40:18,769
He was trying to protect you.

480
00:40:22,333 --> 00:40:24,630
That's why I asked you
not to come back for me.

481
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,112
Why are you sticking up for Sawyer?

482
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:36,770
He'd never do it for you.

483
00:40:43,321 --> 00:40:44,458
Because I love you.

484
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:38,521
Can I help you?

485
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,207
Sorry. I...

486
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,861
Actually, I came...

487
00:42:48,081 --> 00:42:49,133
Is the funeral over?

488
00:42:50,019 --> 00:42:51,957
There was no funeral, sir.
Only a viewing.

489
00:42:53,082 --> 00:42:54,082
Nobody showed up.

490
00:42:56,145 --> 00:42:57,145
Nobody?

491
00:42:58,278 --> 00:42:59,768
- You sure?
- Just you.

492
00:42:59,958 --> 00:43:01,315
My deepest condolences.

493
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:03,582
Friend or family?

494
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,459
Neither.

495
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,526
Would you like me to open it up?

496
00:43:15,756 --> 00:43:16,893
Take your time.

497
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,255
Damn it.

498
00:44:20,063 --> 00:44:21,063
How much further?

499
00:44:21,562 --> 00:44:22,562
About an hour.

500
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:27,498
The radio tower...
when was the last time you were there?

501
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:29,130
The day I recorded the message.

502
00:44:31,373 --> 00:44:34,121
I'll take you to the tower,
but I'm not leaving the island.

503
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:35,996
What?

504
00:44:36,163 --> 00:44:37,767
There's no place for me back there.

505
00:44:38,624 --> 00:44:39,864
This is my home now.

506
00:45:05,748 --> 00:45:06,748
We need to talk.

507
00:45:22,006 --> 00:45:24,068
What did Ben say? Can we kill him?

508
00:45:24,382 --> 00:45:26,592
Is it possible to turn
this equipment off?

509
00:45:27,635 --> 00:45:28,635
What?

510
00:45:28,757 --> 00:45:31,258
The equipment that's jamming
the island, can you turn it off?

511
00:45:31,380 --> 00:45:33,402
Sure. Ben gave us the code.

512
00:45:33,591 --> 00:45:34,961
You are the only ones who have it?

513
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:36,774
Yeah. Why?

514
00:45:37,507 --> 00:45:39,859
What would happen
if the station were to be flooded?

515
00:45:40,536 --> 00:45:42,977
Nothing. The casing for
the equipment is waterproof.

516
00:45:43,141 --> 00:45:44,198
It'll keep going forever.

517
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,634
Then why do you need to be here?

518
00:45:45,758 --> 00:45:47,038
Because Ben told us to.

519
00:45:47,506 --> 00:45:48,664
We were following orders.

520
00:45:48,819 --> 00:45:49,945
And you never asked why?

521
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,940
No, because I trust him,
and I trust Jacob,

522
00:45:54,745 --> 00:45:57,220
and the minute I start
questioning orders, this whole thing...

523
00:45:57,342 --> 00:45:59,542
everything that we're doing here...
falls apart.

524
00:46:03,072 --> 00:46:04,598
She makes an excellent point.

525
00:46:27,509 --> 00:46:28,509
Please...

526
00:46:29,321 --> 00:46:30,321
I'm sorry, Bonnie.

527
00:46:30,696 --> 00:46:32,169
I, too, am following orders.

528
00:46:47,068 --> 00:46:48,068
We need her.

529
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:15,072
Hi. I'm Benjamin. I don't
believe we've had the pleasure...

530
00:47:15,194 --> 00:47:16,369
Don't talk to him!

531
00:47:19,569 --> 00:47:20,569
What do you want?

532
00:47:21,069 --> 00:47:22,595
Just a moment of your time...

533
00:47:23,569 --> 00:47:25,707
to talk, you and me, alone.

534
00:47:27,008 --> 00:47:28,008
For what?

535
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,114
You've just killed seven of my people.

536
00:47:30,236 --> 00:47:32,126
The least you can give me
is five minutes.

537
00:47:37,393 --> 00:47:38,512
Is he alone?

538
00:47:38,666 --> 00:47:40,684
There's only two sets
of tracks... his and hers.

539
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,759
Five minutes.

540
00:48:10,769 --> 00:48:13,619
I'm sorry, sir there are no more
refills left on this prescription.

541
00:48:17,813 --> 00:48:20,063
Well, that... That's a mistake.
I...

542
00:48:20,687 --> 00:48:22,846
I only refilled it twice.
Could you check again?

543
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:25,190
I did check it again, Dr. Shephard,

544
00:48:25,312 --> 00:48:27,931
and that was the third refill,
so there's nothing I can do.

545
00:48:29,939 --> 00:48:32,102
Fine. I've got another prescription
right here.

546
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,764
Hey, I know you.

547
00:48:35,175 --> 00:48:36,198
You're the hero.

548
00:48:36,902 --> 00:48:38,169
I'm not a hero.

549
00:48:38,291 --> 00:48:40,647
We saw it on tv.
Hey, lady, what's wrong with you?

550
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:43,067
Give this guy whatever he needs.
You know what he did?

551
00:48:43,189 --> 00:48:44,294
Here, just... Here...

552
00:48:44,938 --> 00:48:45,938
Oxycodone.

553
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:48,555
Dr. Shephard, you can't write
a prescription for yourself.

554
00:48:48,677 --> 00:48:51,129
That's not me.
That's Dr. Christian Shephard.

555
00:48:51,251 --> 00:48:53,135
I'm Dr. Jack Shephard.
He's my father.

556
00:48:53,396 --> 00:48:54,997
I'm gonna call his office to confirm...

557
00:48:55,152 --> 00:48:57,969
- He's out of town right now.
- I'm sure somebody in the office...

558
00:48:59,568 --> 00:49:00,627
Don't bother.

559
00:49:16,377 --> 00:49:17,377
Have a seat.

560
00:49:25,938 --> 00:49:28,900
Not so long ago, Jack,
I made a decision

561
00:49:29,999 --> 00:49:32,925
that took the lives
of over 40 people in a single day.

562
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,321
I'm telling you this because...

563
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:41,531
history is about
to repeat itself right here,

564
00:49:41,688 --> 00:49:42,688
right now.

565
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:44,273
Let me guess. You've...

566
00:49:44,686 --> 00:49:47,018
You've got us surrounded,
and if I don't do what you say,

567
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,190
you're gonna...

568
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:49,928
You're gonna kill all my people.

569
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:51,821
No, Jack. You are.

570
00:49:55,942 --> 00:49:57,466
And how am I gonna do that?

571
00:49:57,626 --> 00:49:59,041
The woman you're traveling with...

572
00:49:59,687 --> 00:50:02,281
the one who parachuted onto
the island from a helicopter...

573
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:05,268
she's not who she says she is.

574
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,189
- She's not, huh?
- No, she's not.

575
00:50:11,214 --> 00:50:12,312
Then who is she?

576
00:50:12,499 --> 00:50:14,000
She's a representative of some people

577
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,873
who have been trying
to find this island.

578
00:50:18,956 --> 00:50:20,431
She's one of the bad guys.

579
00:50:23,059 --> 00:50:24,602
I almost forgot. You're the...

580
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:26,677
You're the good guys.

581
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:27,940
Jack, listen to me.

582
00:50:28,365 --> 00:50:29,838
If you phone her boat,

583
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:32,976
every single living person
on this island

584
00:50:33,493 --> 00:50:34,612
will be killed.

585
00:50:39,419 --> 00:50:40,924
So here's what has to happen.

586
00:50:41,626 --> 00:50:42,626
Get that device...

587
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:45,420
the phone she carries with her...

588
00:50:46,249 --> 00:50:47,251
and give it to me.

589
00:50:47,855 --> 00:50:48,876
I will turn around.

590
00:50:49,376 --> 00:50:50,607
We'll go back to my people.

591
00:50:51,289 --> 00:50:53,334
You will turn around,
go back to your people.

592
00:50:54,812 --> 00:50:56,022
I'm not going anywhere.

593
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,850
May I have my walkie back?

594
00:51:07,385 --> 00:51:09,604
- What?
- There's something you need to hear.

595
00:51:10,751 --> 00:51:11,751
Please?

596
00:51:21,187 --> 00:51:22,187
Thank you.

597
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:26,783
Tom, are you there?

598
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,333
<i>Yeah, I'm here.</i>

599
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:33,826
Your plan killed seven of my people,

600
00:51:34,465 --> 00:51:37,304
but the ones that you failed to kill
are now holding your friends

601
00:51:37,497 --> 00:51:40,090
Jin, Sayid, Bernard... at gunpoint.

602
00:51:40,746 --> 00:51:42,048
<i>Jack, don't give him any...</i>

603
00:51:42,723 --> 00:51:45,019
<i>- Leave him alone!
- I said shut up!</i>

604
00:51:47,651 --> 00:51:50,579
And what's to stop me
from snapping your neck...

605
00:51:50,701 --> 00:51:53,795
Tom, unless you hear my voice
in one minute, shoot all three of them.

606
00:52:02,237 --> 00:52:03,607
Bring me the phone.

607
00:52:09,307 --> 00:52:10,362
40 seconds.

608
00:52:10,484 --> 00:52:13,397
No.
I'm getting them all off the island.

609
00:52:13,522 --> 00:52:15,314
- All of 'em!
- Let me ask you something.

610
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:16,994
Why do you want to leave the island?

611
00:52:17,116 --> 00:52:19,440
What is it you so desperately
wanna get back to?

612
00:52:20,555 --> 00:52:21,555
You have no one.

613
00:52:22,304 --> 00:52:25,157
Your father's dead. Your wife left you,
moved on with another man.

614
00:52:26,235 --> 00:52:28,357
Can you just not wait
to get back to the hospital,

615
00:52:28,759 --> 00:52:30,129
get back to fixing things?

616
00:52:31,005 --> 00:52:32,298
It's 20 seconds now.

617
00:52:33,429 --> 00:52:34,902
Just get me the phone.

618
00:52:36,225 --> 00:52:37,304
Ten seconds.

619
00:52:37,646 --> 00:52:38,707
Bring me the phone.

620
00:52:38,834 --> 00:52:40,502
- I'm not bluffing.
- I won't do it!

621
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:42,827
Four... three...

622
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:55,305
I'm so sorry, Jack.

623
00:53:27,554 --> 00:53:28,729
Tom, are you there?

624
00:53:31,181 --> 00:53:32,558
Yeah, Jack, I hear you.

625
00:53:34,492 --> 00:53:36,965
I'm gonna lead my people
up to the radio tower,

626
00:53:37,928 --> 00:53:39,922
and I'm gonna make a call,

627
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,681
and I'm gonna get 'em all rescued.

628
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:42,802
Every one of 'em.

629
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,521
And then I'm gonna come find you...

630
00:53:48,368 --> 00:53:49,484
and I'm gonna kill you.

631
00:53:52,684 --> 00:53:53,797
Are you a sodding idiot?

632
00:53:55,308 --> 00:53:58,967
You have the opportunity
to make Ben very, very angry.

633
00:53:59,996 --> 00:54:01,311
Why would you not take that?

634
00:54:07,479 --> 00:54:09,652
- 5-4-5...
- What?

635
00:54:09,942 --> 00:54:11,392
- 8-7-5-5...
- Is that a code?

636
00:54:11,514 --> 00:54:13,123
- 4-3-7...
- Wait.

637
00:54:13,828 --> 00:54:15,536
- Start again, start again.
- 6...

638
00:54:15,724 --> 00:54:16,740
Start from the beginning!

639
00:54:16,862 --> 00:54:18,328
- 1-3.
- Start from the beginning.

640
00:54:18,531 --> 00:54:19,621
Start again.

641
00:54:20,524 --> 00:54:21,739
Wake up, wake up.

642
00:54:21,933 --> 00:54:23,248
Start again. Start again.

643
00:54:23,395 --> 00:54:24,686
<i>Good vibrations.</i>

644
00:54:25,373 --> 00:54:26,373
What?

645
00:54:26,996 --> 00:54:27,996
Beach Boys.

646
00:54:29,247 --> 00:54:30,559
<i>Good vibrations.</i>

647
00:54:33,211 --> 00:54:34,359
On the keypad.

648
00:54:34,747 --> 00:54:35,747
The numbers...

649
00:54:37,355 --> 00:54:38,434
they're notes.

650
00:54:42,557 --> 00:54:44,634
It was programmed by a musician.

651
00:55:10,469 --> 00:55:11,469
Tie him up.

652
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:13,461
He's coming with us.

653
00:55:33,974 --> 00:55:34,974
What?

654
00:55:43,659 --> 00:55:44,711
This is your mother.

655
00:56:15,107 --> 00:56:16,693
Will you help me tie him up?

656
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,015
What happened? What'd he say?

657
00:56:38,921 --> 00:56:40,156
It's not important right now.

658
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:42,950
- Just get everybody together.
- Jack, your knuckles.

659
00:56:56,722 --> 00:56:57,722
What happened?

660
00:57:01,035 --> 00:57:02,035
He killed them.

661
00:57:08,088 --> 00:57:09,284
All three of 'em. He...

662
00:57:11,824 --> 00:57:13,014
He radioed the beach.

663
00:57:14,863 --> 00:57:16,026
And I let it happen.

664
00:57:20,846 --> 00:57:22,107
I had to let it happen.

665
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:26,140
We can't tell Rose...

666
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:27,546
or Sun, not yet.

667
00:57:28,597 --> 00:57:30,575
We gotta keep moving. I promised Sayid

668
00:57:31,358 --> 00:57:32,727
that we would keep moving.

669
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,257
So why did you bring him back?

670
00:57:38,847 --> 00:57:40,373
Why didn't you just kill him?

671
00:57:41,533 --> 00:57:43,059
Because I want him to see it.

672
00:57:45,158 --> 00:57:46,897
I want him to experience the moment

673
00:57:47,019 --> 00:57:49,296
that we get off this island,
and I want him to know...

674
00:57:51,312 --> 00:57:52,410
That he failed.

675
00:57:58,324 --> 00:57:59,655
And then I'll kill him.

676
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,631
It was an order, Tom.
We had to follow it.

677
00:58:06,525 --> 00:58:08,628
Ben didn't know what the hell
he's talking about.

678
00:58:08,788 --> 00:58:11,952
He's lost it.
I mean, look at what they did to us!

679
00:58:12,286 --> 00:58:14,585
Instead of putting three bullets
in the damn sand,

680
00:58:14,855 --> 00:58:16,476
we should've killed them for real.

681
00:58:28,024 --> 00:58:30,435
All they got left is
three guys and four guns.

682
00:58:30,586 --> 00:58:33,229
And all we've got, James,
are two people and no guns.

683
00:58:34,971 --> 00:58:36,125
So we'll wait till night.

684
00:58:36,247 --> 00:58:38,483
That isn't gonna change the fact
that we're unarmed.

685
00:58:38,605 --> 00:58:41,422
If you wanna kill yourself, that's fine,
but before you go and try...

686
00:58:45,595 --> 00:58:46,595
You hear that?

687
00:59:14,427 --> 00:59:15,623
Stay in the bus, hero.

688
00:59:46,470 --> 00:59:47,627
Stay right there, Tom.

689
00:59:57,472 --> 00:59:58,472
I give up.

690
01:00:08,597 --> 01:00:10,433
That's for taking the kid off the raft.

691
01:00:16,845 --> 01:00:18,287
Dude, it was over. He surrendered.

692
01:00:20,974 --> 01:00:22,079
I didn't believe him.

693
01:01:05,507 --> 01:01:07,070
What are you doing, Dr. Shephard?

694
01:01:07,694 --> 01:01:08,831
I was just...

695
01:01:09,821 --> 01:01:11,305
I was just checking the...

696
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:13,820
The Arlen charts.

697
01:01:13,985 --> 01:01:16,570
Just wanted to...
Wanted to see how the operation went.

698
01:01:16,783 --> 01:01:19,580
I left three messages on your
voice mail. You didn't get them?

699
01:01:21,264 --> 01:01:22,401
My phone's broken.

700
01:01:26,201 --> 01:01:27,439
Let's go to my office.

701
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:29,763
For what?

702
01:01:30,013 --> 01:01:32,437
We need to have a talk. Come on.

703
01:01:34,374 --> 01:01:35,638
You know, I know that you're...

704
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,114
You're new around here,
so you don't know much about me...

705
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,335
I know enough.

706
01:01:39,663 --> 01:01:40,792
So let's go to my office...

707
01:01:40,914 --> 01:01:42,940
If you got something to say to me,
say it to me...

708
01:01:43,827 --> 01:01:44,827
Right here.

709
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,118
Will you excuse us, please?

710
01:01:55,351 --> 01:01:58,712
Mrs. Arlen, the woman you saved,
woke up in recovery about two hours ago.

711
01:01:59,389 --> 01:02:01,559
She was in some pain
but highly responsive

712
01:02:01,681 --> 01:02:04,073
to the reflex tests and entirely lucid.

713
01:02:04,958 --> 01:02:06,075
Well, that's...

714
01:02:07,826 --> 01:02:08,826
That's great.

715
01:02:09,075 --> 01:02:11,329
But then she described
the series of events

716
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:12,766
that caused her accident.

717
01:02:14,743 --> 01:02:16,484
She says she was driving over the bridge

718
01:02:16,606 --> 01:02:18,921
when she saw a man
standing on top of the railing

719
01:02:20,390 --> 01:02:21,488
about to jump off.

720
01:02:23,818 --> 01:02:27,002
She was distracted
and lost control of her car.

721
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,618
She ran into the median,

722
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:31,703
rolled over
and was hit by the van behind her.

723
01:02:35,162 --> 01:02:36,893
So the obvious question here...

724
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,404
it's how did you get
to that flaming car so fast?

725
01:02:41,264 --> 01:02:44,269
What were you doing on that bridge?

726
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:54,521
Do you know how many years
I've worked at this hospital?

727
01:02:56,138 --> 01:02:57,138
Do you know...

728
01:02:58,137 --> 01:02:59,351
Anything about me?

729
01:03:00,825 --> 01:03:02,317
Do you have any idea...

730
01:03:03,515 --> 01:03:04,911
what I've been through?

731
01:03:05,888 --> 01:03:07,714
How much have you had to drink today?

732
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:11,478
Okay, I'll tell you what. You do this...

733
01:03:11,856 --> 01:03:13,423
You get my father down here.

734
01:03:13,758 --> 01:03:17,115
Get him down here right now,
and if I'm drunker than he is,

735
01:03:17,389 --> 01:03:18,429
you can fire me.

736
01:03:21,351 --> 01:03:22,828
Don't you look at me like that.

737
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:25,215
Don't you... pity me.

738
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:27,507
- I'm trying to help you...
- You can't help me!

739
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,558
<i>Attention, Others. Come in, Others.</i>

740
01:04:03,426 --> 01:04:04,767
<i>If you're listening to this,</i>

741
01:04:04,941 --> 01:04:06,795
<i>I want you to know
that we got you bastards,</i>

742
01:04:07,798 --> 01:04:10,065
<i>and unless
the rest of you wanna be blown up,</i>

743
01:04:10,648 --> 01:04:12,539
<i>you best stay away from our beach.</i>

744
01:04:16,658 --> 01:04:18,163
<i>Where are you? What's going on?</i>

745
01:04:18,423 --> 01:04:19,896
Dude, I'm back at the beach.

746
01:04:20,326 --> 01:04:21,332
What?

747
01:04:21,454 --> 01:04:23,750
I went back to help Juliet and Sawyer.

748
01:04:24,424 --> 01:04:25,424
I saved them.

749
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,360
You're...

750
01:04:27,551 --> 01:04:28,696
They're okay? Juliet...

751
01:04:28,974 --> 01:04:34,478
Everyone's fine.
Me, Sawyer, Juliet, Sayid, Jin, Bernard.

752
01:04:35,261 --> 01:04:36,361
Wait.

753
01:04:39,113 --> 01:04:41,504
Bernard and Jin and Sayid...
They're with you?

754
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:43,954
Yeah, dude, I told you.
I saved them all.

755
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:00,318
<i>Stay where you are.
We're almost up to the tower.</i>

756
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:02,169
<i>- You'll be safer there.</i>
- Yeah, I gotcha.

757
01:05:02,291 --> 01:05:04,818
We'll stay put until you like,
you know, phone home.

758
01:05:08,082 --> 01:05:09,082
What about Charlie?

759
01:05:09,268 --> 01:05:10,595
Did he make it back yet?

760
01:05:10,893 --> 01:05:13,832
Not yet, but they're probably
paddling home as we speak.

761
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:15,840
Don't worry. I'm sure he's fine.

762
01:05:29,647 --> 01:05:31,325
There's diving gear
on those racks, yeah?

763
01:05:31,953 --> 01:05:34,142
- Aye. It's plenty.
- Why don't you take care of that?

764
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,790
- I'll tap out <i>Good Vibrations</i>.
- Alright, mate.

765
01:05:40,064 --> 01:05:41,318
You get any flashes?

766
01:05:43,265 --> 01:05:44,363
No. Nothin'.

767
01:05:46,953 --> 01:05:48,282
I'll meet you back here, then.

768
01:06:41,238 --> 01:06:42,452
So much for fate.

769
01:06:53,604 --> 01:06:54,916
"Incoming transmission"?

770
01:07:01,095 --> 01:07:02,427
<i>Can you hear me ?</i>

771
01:07:02,967 --> 01:07:05,035
Yes! Yes, I can hear you.

772
01:07:05,157 --> 01:07:06,720
<i>Who is this? Who am I speaking to?</i>

773
01:07:08,349 --> 01:07:10,112
Charlie Pace.
I'm a survivor of flight

774
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:13,481
8-1-5... Oceanic, flight 8-1-5.

775
01:07:14,371 --> 01:07:15,548
<i>Where are you?</i>

776
01:07:15,792 --> 01:07:17,329
We're on an island. We're alive.

777
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:19,535
<i>An island? Well, where?
What's the location?</i>

778
01:07:19,668 --> 01:07:21,251
I don't know. Who's this?

779
01:07:21,483 --> 01:07:22,756
<i>This is Penelope.</i>

780
01:07:22,891 --> 01:07:24,289
<i>Penelope Widmore.</i>

781
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,382
<i>How did you get this frequency?</i>

782
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:34,079
<i>Did you just say, "Desmond"?</i>

783
01:07:34,295 --> 01:07:36,448
Yeah, he's here. He's with me.

784
01:07:36,772 --> 01:07:38,859
<i>- Is he okay?</i>
- He's brilliant!

785
01:07:38,981 --> 01:07:40,095
Hey, are you on the boat?

786
01:07:40,217 --> 01:07:42,010
- <i>What boat?</i>
- Your boat...

787
01:07:42,168 --> 01:07:43,343
80 miles offshore.

788
01:07:44,355 --> 01:07:45,931
Naomi, parachutist.

789
01:07:46,053 --> 01:07:47,166
<i>I'm not on a boat.</i>

790
01:07:47,288 --> 01:07:48,773
<i>Who's Naomi?</i>

791
01:08:21,644 --> 01:08:22,879
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

792
01:10:31,676 --> 01:10:33,374
Hey, Aaron, it's okay, sweetie.

793
01:10:33,701 --> 01:10:34,897
What's the matter?

794
01:10:35,505 --> 01:10:37,345
I don't know.
I think he's just a bit scared.

795
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,300
Hard to blame him.

796
01:10:43,303 --> 01:10:45,595
- What is it?
- What's your boyfriend's name...

797
01:10:45,717 --> 01:10:47,366
The rock star who goes to the station?

798
01:10:47,488 --> 01:10:48,488
Charlie. Why?

799
01:10:51,942 --> 01:10:53,331
Charlie just got us rescued.

800
01:10:59,925 --> 01:11:01,025
He did it!

801
01:11:01,177 --> 01:11:03,181
- Your friend bloody well did it.
- What?

802
01:11:03,862 --> 01:11:05,864
The green light... it's on.
The jamming stopped.

803
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,239
Use it, then.

804
01:11:07,612 --> 01:11:08,612
Alright.

805
01:11:11,034 --> 01:11:12,113
<i>4-2.</i>

806
01:11:17,175 --> 01:11:18,175
What's this?

807
01:11:19,365 --> 01:11:21,829
It's Rousseau's message.
It's still blocking the signal.

808
01:11:22,206 --> 01:11:24,425
It doesn't matter. We're here.

809
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:28,442
<i>Iteration 1-7-5-0-4-5.</i>

810
01:12:22,547 --> 01:12:24,476
I recorded this 16 years ago.

811
01:12:25,825 --> 01:12:28,063
Three days before you were born.

812
01:12:34,200 --> 01:12:35,763
I guess we don't need it anymore.

813
01:12:43,138 --> 01:12:44,390
All right. Do it.

814
01:12:52,075 --> 01:12:53,499
I can't get a signal in here.

815
01:13:11,486 --> 01:13:12,759
I'm getting something.

816
01:13:15,066 --> 01:13:16,108
It's gonna work.

817
01:13:16,266 --> 01:13:18,446
It's happening.
We're gonna get off of this island.

818
01:13:19,201 --> 01:13:20,629
We'll celebrate when we're home.

819
01:13:25,448 --> 01:13:27,582
I know you think
you're saving your people,

820
01:13:28,448 --> 01:13:29,816
but you need to stop this.

821
01:13:30,387 --> 01:13:31,387
It's a mistake.

822
01:13:31,756 --> 01:13:33,318
The mistake was listening to you.

823
01:13:33,514 --> 01:13:35,213
This will be your last chance.

824
01:13:35,511 --> 01:13:37,305
I'm telling you, making that call

825
01:13:37,575 --> 01:13:39,048
is the beginning of the end.

826
01:13:39,635 --> 01:13:41,066
I've got it! I've got a signal!

827
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:45,241
Jack, please!
You don't know what you're doing!

828
01:13:45,389 --> 01:13:46,699
I know exactly what I'm doing.

829
01:14:05,922 --> 01:14:07,078
Step back, Jack.

830
01:14:16,014 --> 01:14:17,014
What did you do?

831
01:14:17,174 --> 01:14:19,412
What I had to. Now step back.

832
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:27,724
Stay away from the phone.

833
01:14:36,351 --> 01:14:37,528
What are you doing?

834
01:14:38,328 --> 01:14:39,422
I don't want to shoot you.

835
01:14:39,703 --> 01:14:40,913
Do it, John! Shoot him!

836
01:14:41,269 --> 01:14:42,338
Do what you need...

837
01:14:49,828 --> 01:14:53,567
Please, put the phone down.

838
01:14:57,734 --> 01:14:59,741
You're done keeping me on this island

839
01:15:05,329 --> 01:15:06,329
I will...

840
01:15:06,891 --> 01:15:07,899
kill you...

841
01:15:08,446 --> 01:15:09,538
if I have to.

842
01:15:10,008 --> 01:15:11,127
Then do it.

843
01:15:32,810 --> 01:15:34,624
You're not supposed to do this.

844
01:15:39,324 --> 01:15:40,414
<i>Minkowski.</i>

845
01:15:49,204 --> 01:15:50,225
Who is this?

846
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:51,595
<i>Who is this?</i>

847
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:55,613
My name's Jack Shephard. Are you...

848
01:15:56,541 --> 01:15:58,091
Are you on the boat... the freighter?

849
01:15:58,766 --> 01:15:59,982
<i>How'd you get this channel?</i>

850
01:16:01,317 --> 01:16:03,090
Naomi told us about your search team,

851
01:16:03,212 --> 01:16:04,291
about the boat.

852
01:16:04,655 --> 01:16:08,248
<i>Naomi? You found her?
Where is she? Who are you?</i>

853
01:16:10,044 --> 01:16:12,785
I'm one of the survivors
of oceanic flight 815.

854
01:16:15,042 --> 01:16:16,766
Can you get a fix on our location?

855
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:18,515
<i>Hell, yeah, we can.</i>

856
01:16:18,637 --> 01:16:21,280
<i>Sit tight. We'll be right there.</i>

857
01:17:24,791 --> 01:17:25,791
It's me.

858
01:17:27,281 --> 01:17:29,539
Wait. Don't... Don't hang up, please.

859
01:17:32,447 --> 01:17:34,063
I know what you said. I just...

860
01:17:35,996 --> 01:17:37,315
I just need to see you.

861
01:17:38,417 --> 01:17:39,417
Please.

862
01:17:43,668 --> 01:17:44,983
Yeah, out at the airport.

863
01:17:46,854 --> 01:17:47,854
You know where.

864
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:52,480
Thank you.

865
01:19:14,918 --> 01:19:15,970
Saw you on the news.

866
01:19:17,855 --> 01:19:20,057
Still pulling people
out of burning wreckage, huh?

867
01:19:21,104 --> 01:19:22,104
Old habits.

868
01:19:26,153 --> 01:19:27,291
You look terrible.

869
01:19:29,918 --> 01:19:30,918
Thanks.

870
01:19:33,856 --> 01:19:35,224
Why did you call me?

871
01:19:46,787 --> 01:19:48,542
I was hoping that you'd heard,

872
01:19:49,196 --> 01:19:50,758
that maybe you'd go to the funeral.

873
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:55,953
Why would I go to the funeral?

874
01:20:09,092 --> 01:20:10,365
Been flying a lot.

875
01:20:12,246 --> 01:20:13,295
What?

876
01:20:13,417 --> 01:20:15,028
The golden pass that they gave us.

877
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:17,117
I've been using it.

878
01:20:17,415 --> 01:20:18,678
Every friday night, I...

879
01:20:20,853 --> 01:20:23,687
I fly from L.A. to Tokyo or...

880
01:20:25,104 --> 01:20:28,256
Singapore or... Sydney.

881
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,261
And then I...

882
01:20:32,416 --> 01:20:33,668
I get off, and I...

883
01:20:34,417 --> 01:20:36,635
have a drink
and then I fly home.

884
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:39,666
Why?

885
01:20:43,105 --> 01:20:44,841
Because I want it to crash.

886
01:20:48,986 --> 01:20:51,378
I don't care
about anybody else on board.

887
01:20:53,505 --> 01:20:55,550
Every little bump we hit or...

888
01:20:56,225 --> 01:20:57,531
turbulence, I mean, like,

889
01:20:58,669 --> 01:21:00,579
I actually close my eyes,

890
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:03,381
and I pray

891
01:21:04,288 --> 01:21:05,677
that I can get back...

892
01:21:13,917 --> 01:21:16,194
- This is not gonna change...
- No, I'm sick...

893
01:21:16,869 --> 01:21:18,044
of lying.

894
01:21:21,872 --> 01:21:23,105
We made a mistake.

895
01:21:30,042 --> 01:21:31,042
I have to go.

896
01:21:31,854 --> 01:21:33,555
He's gonna be wondering where I am...

897
01:21:40,666 --> 01:21:41,666
We...

898
01:21:42,417 --> 01:21:43,838
were not supposed to leave.

899
01:21:44,667 --> 01:21:45,667
Yes, we were.

900
01:21:54,487 --> 01:21:55,606
Good-bye, Jack.

901
01:22:04,695 --> 01:22:06,105
We have to go back, Kate.

902
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:25,169
We have to go back!
