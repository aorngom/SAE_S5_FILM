00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,687
<i>Previously, on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:10,578
Beach camp's right over there.

3
00:00:10,871 --> 00:00:12,127
Can you get me some clothes?

4
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,431
What happened to yours?

5
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:15,893
I woke up in the jungle like this.

6
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:17,150
Well, F.Y.I.,

7
00:00:17,338 --> 00:00:19,246
the whole island vibrated,

8
00:00:19,927 --> 00:00:21,317
Kate, Jack and Sawyer saw it, too,

9
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:23,545
right before they had bags
pulled over their heads--

10
00:00:23,593 --> 00:00:24,670
Don't worry.

11
00:00:25,247 --> 00:00:26,702
Locke's gonna go after them.

12
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:29,140
- He said so in his speech.
- What speech?

13
00:00:30,708 --> 00:00:32,211
I'm gonna find our friends.

14
00:00:33,269 --> 00:00:34,715
We're gonna find them-- all of them.

15
00:00:35,414 --> 00:00:37,464
I don't know how yet, but I will.

16
00:00:42,316 --> 00:00:44,375
You've got a problem with your roof.

17
00:00:45,018 --> 00:00:46,019
Roof ?

18
00:00:58,405 --> 00:01:07,104
3x08 - Flashes Before Your Eyes

19
00:01:11,255 --> 00:01:12,899
Dude, I don't know about this.

20
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:16,008
See, you're looking at this all wrong.

21
00:01:16,395 --> 00:01:18,039
He would want us to do this.

22
00:01:18,275 --> 00:01:20,883
He would want us to ransack
is tent and stash?

23
00:01:21,705 --> 00:01:23,457
Yeah, that's sounds exactly like Sawyer.

24
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:24,766
He stole all this.

25
00:01:24,851 --> 00:01:26,353
I mean, people need food.

26
00:01:26,618 --> 00:01:28,630
They need medical supplies. They need...

27
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:31,935
shocking amounts of pornography.

28
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:36,498
Desmondo!

29
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,645
- I need you to come with me.
- You guys find Eko?

30
00:01:40,646 --> 00:01:41,648
Both of you.

31
00:02:07,985 --> 00:02:09,033
What happened?

32
00:02:10,366 --> 00:02:11,368
Eko is dead.

33
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:15,724
We found his body in the jungle...

34
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,698
buried him yesterday.

35
00:02:19,007 --> 00:02:20,018
How did he died?

36
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:23,935
The island killed him.

37
00:02:25,428 --> 00:02:27,667
What do you mean
"the island killed him"?

38
00:02:32,325 --> 00:02:33,979
You know what it means.

39
00:02:35,164 --> 00:02:36,851
With the doctor gone the camp is on edge

40
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:40,054
enough without people having to worry
about what's out here in the jungle.

41
00:02:40,437 --> 00:02:42,837
They are gonna look to you two.
See how you react.

42
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:46,014
So when I tell everyone what happened,
I need you to...

43
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,095
help keep things calm.

44
00:02:49,238 --> 00:02:50,305
Dude, you okay?

45
00:02:52,327 --> 00:02:53,360
Hey, guys.

46
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,200
What's wrong with Desmond?

47
00:03:16,585 --> 00:03:17,596
What is he doing?

48
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:26,471
There is someone else out there.

49
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:33,996
Where's Claire?

50
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:37,216
Just went for a walk.
I offered to watch the baby.

51
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,673
- I've got her.
- Is she okay?

52
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,790
- What happened?
- Stand back. just give me some room!

53
00:04:01,495 --> 00:04:03,460
Get back Charlie, I know what I'm doing.

54
00:04:03,555 --> 00:04:05,208
Is she breathing? She's not breathing?

55
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:16,897
Do you want me to help you?

56
00:04:23,749 --> 00:04:24,935
You all right?

57
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:27,571
Cough it up.

58
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,050
It's all right, Charlie.

59
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:32,486
- Okay, let's get her back to the tent.
- Is she okay?

60
00:04:32,656 --> 00:04:35,388
- Let me help.
- I've got her, Charlie.

61
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:38,213
Where are you going?

62
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:40,258
Hey, how did he know?

63
00:04:42,337 --> 00:04:43,773
How did he know she was drowning?

64
00:04:46,137 --> 00:04:47,564
I'll tell you how he knew.

65
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:50,896
That guy...

66
00:04:52,146 --> 00:04:53,554
sees the future, dude.

68
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:32,382
She's beautifull.

69
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:35,953
Aye.

70
00:05:36,754 --> 00:05:37,757
Thanks.

71
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,821
- What's her name?
- Penny...

72
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:43,775
Penelop.

73
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,247
How are you feeling?

74
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,936
Still a little shaken up.

75
00:05:51,682 --> 00:05:53,884
I go to swimming almost every day and...

76
00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:57,220
the undertow just grabbed me.

77
00:05:58,373 --> 00:05:59,649
You know, if you hadn't...

78
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,256
I thought you were only gonna be
five minutes. Aaron's starving.

79
00:06:05,378 --> 00:06:07,249
Yeah, um... sorry.

80
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,262
Anyway, I just really wanted to say...

81
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,657
thank you.

82
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:18,739
Thank you so much...

83
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:20,967
for being there.

84
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,477
It was my pleasure.

85
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:34,790
Locke doesn't know about anything
except knives and fishing.

86
00:06:34,949 --> 00:06:38,224
There's nothing to know. I don't buy
this precognitive insanity rubbish.

87
00:06:38,322 --> 00:06:40,500
Look, if the bearded wonder
could predict the future,

88
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,821
he wouldn't have ended up here,
would he?

89
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,718
Well, whatever happened to him,
we're gonna have to find out what it is.

90
00:06:48,249 --> 00:06:51,499
You do realize he's gonna know your plan
before you even come up with it, dude.

91
00:06:51,622 --> 00:06:52,900
In that case...

92
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,433
we're gonna have
to get him really bloody drunk.

93
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,310
Beautiful evening.

94
00:07:13,813 --> 00:07:14,890
Aye

95
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,610
Say it, dude.

96
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,476
This morning...

97
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:24,720
I'm sorry I wasn't more... grateful.

98
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,929
Thank you for helping Claire not drown.

99
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,755
No harm done.

100
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:34,048
Excellent.

101
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,846
Brought a peace offering.

102
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:39,236
You know, make the truce official.

103
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,011
Thanks, but no.

104
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,810
I've spent a wee bit too much time drunk
as of late.

105
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:50,680
Too good for us, brother.

106
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,642
All right, that's fine.

107
00:07:55,464 --> 00:07:57,627
We'll take our drink
and go somewhere else.

108
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,147
What kind of whiskey is that?

109
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,545
It's, uh... just says "Maccutcheon".

110
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,025
All right, then.

111
00:08:17,328 --> 00:08:18,358
Let's have it.

112
00:08:20,377 --> 00:08:21,757
No, the bottle, brother.

113
00:08:22,244 --> 00:08:24,465
I mean,
if you've come to drink, let's drink.

114
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:25,539
Hey, let's drink.

115
00:09:01,722 --> 00:09:03,102
Are all your songs about

116
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:06,738
drinking and fighting
and girls with one leg?

117
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,366
Well...
girls with one leg and a heart of gold.

118
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,920
So, Dezzie...

119
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:24,358
let me ask you something.

120
00:09:24,696 --> 00:09:25,773
Anything, pal.

121
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,128
How'd you know Claire was drowning?

122
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:34,987
I could hear her calling for help.

123
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,438
Uh, no, you didn't.

124
00:09:38,297 --> 00:09:39,931
You were, like, a mile away.

125
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,064
Well, I suppose I...

126
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:47,011
I've got good hearing.

127
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,725
You...

128
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,629
hear the lightning as well?

129
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,900
Excuse me?

130
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,199
The lightning.

131
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:04,780
Just by chance, you pitched
your little rod outside Claire's tent,

132
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,790
and two hours later, lightning strikes.

133
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,325
Thanks for the drink, pal.

134
00:10:21,235 --> 00:10:22,775
I don't know what you're doing.

135
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,173
You'd best tell us.

136
00:10:25,317 --> 00:10:28,049
You think because you turned some key,
that makes you a hero?

137
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:29,636
You're no hero, brother.

138
00:10:29,941 --> 00:10:31,383
I don't know how you're doing

139
00:10:31,449 --> 00:10:33,600
but I know a coward when I see one.

140
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:39,978
You don't want to know what happened
to me when I turned that key!

141
00:10:40,054 --> 00:10:41,500
You don't want to know--

142
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:43,450
- You don't want to know!
- Get him off!

143
00:10:58,587 --> 00:10:59,589
Wait!

144
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:02,518
I'll see you in another life, brother.

145
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,686
I love you, Penny.

146
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,863
My god.

147
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,431
Des, are you all right?

148
00:11:46,481 --> 00:11:48,180
Stay there. Hang on.

149
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm just getting ice.

150
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,058
Are you all right?

151
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,700
- Sweetie, you okay?
- What's happening?

152
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:02,330
Well, what's happening
is the result of combining ladders,

153
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,219
painting the ceiling and alcohol.

154
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:06,980
Are you okay? Are you nauseous?

155
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,025
This is my flat.

156
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:13,280
Although if you want me
to feel at home here,

157
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:15,425
you might startcalling it our flat.

158
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,698
How many fingers, Des?

159
00:12:21,885 --> 00:12:22,915
Love, look at me.

160
00:12:23,671 --> 00:12:24,720
What's wrong?

161
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,451
Absolutely nothing.

162
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,415
Here.

163
00:13:04,032 --> 00:13:05,049
Let me.

164
00:13:06,514 --> 00:13:08,205
- Thanks.
- Hang on.

165
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,354
You've got paint on your neck.

166
00:13:15,425 --> 00:13:16,739
How's that concussion?

167
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:18,153
Well, my...

168
00:13:18,692 --> 00:13:22,590
severe head injury is a small price to
pay for the pleasure of having...

169
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,470
you move into my humble...

170
00:13:26,284 --> 00:13:27,314
is...

171
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,406
"rat trap" accurate?

172
00:13:38,702 --> 00:13:39,738
<i>Voilà.</i>

173
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:45,250
You know you don't really need a job
from my father, Des.

174
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,698
It's not about the job.

175
00:13:47,274 --> 00:13:48,729
I want him to respect me.

176
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,068
Then respect you he shall.

177
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:54,815
But if for some reason he's too daft
to see how brilliant you are,

178
00:13:54,871 --> 00:13:57,060
it's not the end of the world.

179
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,918
What did you say?

180
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:19,872
Here you go, luv.

181
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,900
You all right?

182
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:23,849
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

183
00:14:23,924 --> 00:14:24,948
Just...

184
00:14:26,159 --> 00:14:28,920
Just had a bit of a déjà vu, that's all.

185
00:14:40,524 --> 00:14:41,650
Good afternoon.

186
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,830
I'm here to see mr. Widmore.

187
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:48,577
- And you are?
- Hume, Mr. Desmond Hume.

188
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:51,070
Hello, luv.

189
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:54,850
Got a parcel here for 8-15.

190
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,138
Excuse me.

191
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,176
What did you say?

192
00:14:59,411 --> 00:15:03,470
I said, "delivery for 8-15".

193
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,285
Mr. Hume?

194
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:11,050
Mr. Widmore is ready for you.

195
00:15:13,909 --> 00:15:14,914
Thank you.

196
00:15:22,326 --> 00:15:24,860
Penny didn't tell me
you were an actor, Desmond.

197
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:28,918
No, it's actually set design
for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

198
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:30,178
Impressive.

199
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:33,134
You didn't graduate from university.

200
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,476
No, Sir.

201
00:15:34,795 --> 00:15:36,183
I had to look after my 3 brothers

202
00:15:36,249 --> 00:15:38,650
- after my father--
- Any military experience?

203
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,271
No, Sir.

204
00:15:46,352 --> 00:15:47,496
She's beautiful...

205
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,120
your boat.

206
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:54,710
My foundation is sponsoring
a solo race around the world.

207
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:01,690
Something wrong?

208
00:16:02,889 --> 00:16:03,970
No, Sir.

209
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,479
Well, Desmond, I'm going to see to it

210
00:16:07,535 --> 00:16:10,719
that you have a position
in our administrative department.

211
00:16:10,813 --> 00:16:14,200
Not the most glamorous duty,
but it's a start.

212
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,970
- I'll speak to human resources.
- With all due respect, Sir...

213
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,583
I haven't come here to...

214
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:24,990
interview for
a position in your company.

215
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:27,734
- You haven't?
- No, Sir.

216
00:16:30,607 --> 00:16:33,553
I came here to ask
for your daughter's hand in marriage.

217
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:38,830
We've been together
two years now, and...

218
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,525
Pen's moving in...

219
00:16:41,816 --> 00:16:43,207
and...

220
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:44,896
I love her.

221
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,630
Your permission would
mean everything to me.

222
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:53,730
I'm impressed, Hume.

223
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,030
Very noble gesture.

224
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,949
- You know anything about whiskey?
- No, I'm afraid not, Sir.

225
00:17:06,953 --> 00:17:11,155
This is a 60-year MacCutcheon,
named after Anderson MacCutcheon,

226
00:17:11,296 --> 00:17:13,699
esteemed admiral from the Royal Navy.

227
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:15,652
He retired

228
00:17:16,451 --> 00:17:19,650
with more medals
than any man before or since,

229
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:22,760
moved to the Highlands
to see out his remaining years.

230
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:25,680
Admiral MacCutcheon
was a great man, Hume.

231
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,880
This was his crowning achievement.

232
00:17:35,253 --> 00:17:36,802
This swallow

233
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:40,480
is worth more
than you could make in a month.

234
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,552
And to share it with you
would be a waste

235
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:53,814
and a disgrace
to the great man who made it,

236
00:17:54,735 --> 00:17:56,946
because you, Hume,

237
00:17:57,182 --> 00:17:59,230
will never be a great man.

238
00:18:05,870 --> 00:18:07,422
Mr. Widmore...

239
00:18:09,525 --> 00:18:12,130
- I know I'm not--
- What you're not...

240
00:18:12,483 --> 00:18:14,950
is worthy of drinking my whiskey.

241
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,532
How could you ever be
worthy of my daughter?

242
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,390
Thank you very much. A fiver!
Thank you very much.

243
00:19:13,671 --> 00:19:15,446
- I know you.
- That's fine. See you later.

244
00:19:15,493 --> 00:19:18,300
- How do I know you?
- You can leave your number if you want.

245
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:19,940
How do I know you?

246
00:19:20,236 --> 00:19:21,570
I don't...

247
00:19:22,505 --> 00:19:24,627
- Where do I know you from?
- Look,

248
00:19:24,768 --> 00:19:27,500
I don't know, but I'll remember
if I could get some help.

249
00:19:31,163 --> 00:19:32,943
Hey, can I get some help?

250
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,469
You're Charlie.

251
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:38,210
Yeah, name's on the sign.

252
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,970
<i>System failure.</i>

253
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,870
- No...
- Thanks a lot.

254
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,260
The... It was in the hatch.

255
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:50,890
I remember seeing you. There was a...

256
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:53,550
There was a computer,
there was a button. We...

257
00:19:55,394 --> 00:19:57,253
We were on an island.

258
00:19:57,354 --> 00:19:59,110
We are on an island, mate.
This is England.

259
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:01,870
- No, it was real, man, I remember!
- Hey, all right.

260
00:20:01,927 --> 00:20:03,898
This is why we don't do drugs.

261
00:20:03,927 --> 00:20:07,240
No, this... I remember this.
This all happened before.

262
00:20:07,386 --> 00:20:09,076
Today...

263
00:20:10,036 --> 00:20:11,896
This happened today. This...

264
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,696
I remember that he said I wasn't worthy,

265
00:20:15,762 --> 00:20:19,030
and then I came down
and I took off my tie,

266
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:22,300
and then I lost my tie,
and Penny said, "where was it"?

267
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:23,920
And then it started to rain!

268
00:20:36,447 --> 00:20:38,360
Your thesis is a bit neat.

269
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,548
The wild card, Partridge,
is unpredictability.

270
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:43,270
Run the same test ten times,
you'll get ten different outcomes.

271
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:44,849
That's what makes life so wonderfully--

272
00:20:44,888 --> 00:20:47,124
- Donovan!
- Case in point.

273
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,600
Who could have known that a drenched
Scotsman would appear in this rotunda?

274
00:20:52,516 --> 00:20:55,730
- You've looked better. Not much, but...
- I need to ask you something.

275
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,443
By all means, do.

276
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,117
What do you know about time travel?

277
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:15,765
Are you bloody insane?

278
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:17,437
Just tell me if it's possible.

279
00:21:17,514 --> 00:21:18,612
Which part?

280
00:21:18,746 --> 00:21:20,422
The island full of mysterious hatches,

281
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,850
or the computer
which keeps the world from ending?

282
00:21:24,314 --> 00:21:26,047
Forget you're my best mate, all right?

283
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,092
As a physicist, is it possible
that I've somehow managed to

284
00:21:30,848 --> 00:21:34,643
go back in time and
am now living my life over again?

285
00:21:37,551 --> 00:21:38,784
It's not funny, Donovan.

286
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,661
Penny's father berates you
for not being a great man,

287
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,313
and voilà, you've dreamed a future where
you push a buttonto save the world.

288
00:21:45,352 --> 00:21:47,413
These things are not in my head,
brother.

289
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:50,413
I remember things.

290
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:52,414
All right, then.

291
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,434
What happens next?

292
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,771
It doesn't work like that.

293
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,137
I don't remember everything, just...

294
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,412
just bits and pieces.

295
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,517
How wonderfully convenient.

296
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,495
I remember this.

297
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,774
I know this song.

298
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:23,804
The jukebox...

299
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,993
Des, you're worrying me now.

300
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,300
I remember this night.

301
00:22:33,155 --> 00:22:34,997
Graybridge comes back
from two goals down in

302
00:22:35,016 --> 00:22:37,583
the final two minutes to win this game.
It's a bloody miracle!

303
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,848
And right after they win,
Jimmy Lennon's gonna come through

304
00:22:40,905 --> 00:22:43,782
that door and hit the bartender
right in the head with a cricket bat,

305
00:22:43,801 --> 00:22:44,822
'cause he owes him money.

306
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,340
- Seriously, Des-
- Watch, please.

307
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,062
Just watch.

308
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,062
He'll score the first goal right now.

309
00:22:55,293 --> 00:22:56,872
<i>Brilliant save by...</i>

310
00:22:58,061 --> 00:22:59,072
They came back.

311
00:22:59,411 --> 00:23:00,839
They--they won.

312
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,511
Jimmy Lennon, cricket bat.

313
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,800
There's no such thing
as time travel, Des.

314
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,701
And from what I understand,
true love can be just as unlikely.

315
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,001
So,

316
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,619
if you love Penny,

317
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:32,834
stop messing about and marry her.

318
00:24:11,102 --> 00:24:12,624
You smell like the pub.

319
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:15,980
That's because I was at the pub.

320
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,684
You didn't get the job.

321
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,717
What did my father say?

322
00:24:25,206 --> 00:24:28,183
Your father... was lovely.

323
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,805
We just both agreed that I wasn't...

324
00:24:33,225 --> 00:24:34,453
exactly qualified.

325
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,380
I say we celebrate.

326
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:40,660
I say we celebrate that fate
has spared you a miserable existence

327
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:43,060
under the employ of Widmore industries.

328
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:44,727
Let me take you out tomorrow.

329
00:24:44,766 --> 00:24:46,800
Let's go for lobsters on the pier,
my treat.

330
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:49,333
I don't think my failure
to impress your father is any

331
00:24:49,814 --> 00:24:51,028
occasion to celebrate.

332
00:24:51,086 --> 00:24:52,742
Well, the occasion is I love you.

333
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,338
Why?

334
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,377
Why do you love me?

335
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:05,479
'Cause you're a good man.

336
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:09,865
In my experience,
they're pretty hard to come by.

337
00:25:25,314 --> 00:25:26,566
Where are you?

338
00:25:29,181 --> 00:25:30,510
I'm right here.

339
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:44,789
Never done this before, have you?

340
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:48,979
Is it that obvious?

341
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:51,722
I can always tell the first-timers.

342
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:56,685
Now then, may I ask your price range?

343
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,785
I'm not a man of means.

344
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:02,178
I hope to, you know, one day...

345
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,533
I have just the thing.

346
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:19,767
This won't blind any queens,
to be sure, but still,

347
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,846
it has the sparkle of life.

348
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,630
I'll take it.

349
00:26:32,816 --> 00:26:34,100
I'm... sorry?

350
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,847
It's perfect. I'll take it.

351
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,621
No, you won't.

352
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,086
Give me the ring. Give it here.

353
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,185
I don't understand.

354
00:26:46,239 --> 00:26:48,144
This is wrong. You don't buy the ring.

355
00:26:48,741 --> 00:26:51,372
You--you have second thoughts.
You walk right out that door.

356
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,941
So come on. Let's have it.

357
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:57,430
I don't know what you're on about.

358
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,764
You don't buy the ring, Desmond.

359
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,525
How do you know my name?

360
00:27:05,581 --> 00:27:09,376
I know your name as well as I know
that you don't ask Penny to marry you.

361
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,162
In fact, you break her heart.

362
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:12,770
Well, breaking her heart, of course,

363
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:15,830
is what drives you
in a few short years from now

364
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,691
to enter that sailing race
to prove her father wrong,

365
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:22,279
which brings you to the island
where you spend the next three years

366
00:27:22,356 --> 00:27:25,213
of your life entering numbers
into the computer,

367
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,050
until you are forced
to turn that fail-safe key.

368
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:35,700
And if you don't do those things,
Desmond David Hume,

369
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,246
every single one of us is dead.

370
00:27:43,602 --> 00:27:45,586
So give me that sodding ring.

371
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:56,600
You're going to be difficult
about this, I can see.

372
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,870
Who are you?

373
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:02,029
Do you like chestnuts?

374
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,802
What?

375
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,001
Thank you.

376
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:17,460
That man over there
is wearing red shoes.

377
00:28:20,658 --> 00:28:22,584
So? What, then?

378
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,089
Just thought it was a bold
fashion choice worth noting.

379
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,400
This isn't really happening, is it?

380
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:36,840
Sorry?

381
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:42,209
I've had a concussion.

382
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,760
You're my subconscious.

383
00:28:47,782 --> 00:28:48,938
Am I?

384
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,077
You're here to...

385
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,378
to talk me out of marrying Penny.

386
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:56,780
Well, it won't bloody work.

387
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,599
Oh, yes, it will.

388
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:02,120
There is no island.
There is no button.

389
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,593
It's madness.
I love her. She loves me.

390
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,368
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life with her.

391
00:29:10,719 --> 00:29:11,903
No, Desmond...

392
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,519
You knew that was gonna happen,
didn't you?

393
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,980
Then why didn't youstop it?
Why didn't you do anything?

394
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,983
Because it wouldn't matter.

395
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:43,632
Had I warned himabout the scaffolding,

396
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,540
tomorrow he'd be hit by a taxi.

397
00:29:45,615 --> 00:29:47,347
If I warned himabout the taxi,

398
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:49,950
he'd fall in the shower
and break his neck.

399
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,720
The universe, unfortunately,
has a way of...

400
00:29:55,156 --> 00:29:56,774
course-correcting.

401
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,305
That man was supposed to die.

402
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,494
That was his path.

403
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:11,225
Just as it's your path
to go to the island.

404
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,580
You don't do it
because you choose to, Desmond,

405
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:19,505
you do it because you're supposed to.

406
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,847
I'm gonna meet Penny in an hour.

407
00:30:27,783 --> 00:30:29,160
I've got the ring.

408
00:30:29,714 --> 00:30:31,140
She'll say yes.

409
00:30:31,948 --> 00:30:33,797
I can choose whatever I want.

410
00:30:37,518 --> 00:30:40,176
You may not like your path, Desmond,

411
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:47,059
but pushing that button is the only
truly great thing that you will ever do.

412
00:30:57,306 --> 00:30:58,808
How much for the ring?

413
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:51,927
- Am I late?
- Right on time.

414
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:56,016
Take your photo, lovebirds?

415
00:31:56,074 --> 00:31:57,172
No, thanks, mate.

416
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,470
Come on, something
to show the grandkids.

417
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,039
Come on, Des, let's do it
for all those grandkids.

418
00:32:02,314 --> 00:32:03,874
You'll do it?
All righty.

419
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:06,512
Let's see what we got for you here, eh?

420
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,767
Ah, a beautiful desert scene.

421
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,790
No, not the desert?
All right.

422
00:32:11,182 --> 00:32:12,521
I know. The Alps.

423
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:14,109
I love the Alps.

424
00:32:14,110 --> 00:32:15,169
I hate the Alps.

425
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:16,598
Yeah, not the alps.

426
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:20,220
Here we go.
Beautiful marina scene.

427
00:32:20,427 --> 00:32:22,465
- Yeah, let's do that.
- It's the one, isn't it?

428
00:32:23,761 --> 00:32:24,763
All right.

429
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,741
Take your coat off. It's boiling.
There's palm trees.

430
00:32:28,777 --> 00:32:29,810
Here we go.

431
00:32:34,685 --> 00:32:35,975
An instant classic.

432
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,996
- Only 5 quid.
- Here we go, luv.

433
00:32:40,781 --> 00:32:41,937
Here you go, mate.

434
00:32:43,752 --> 00:32:45,004
Out of 20.

435
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,277
You're a lovely couple.

436
00:32:47,356 --> 00:32:49,629
Small price to pay
for the memories, right?

437
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,882
I couldn't go through with it.

438
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,395
What was that?

439
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,524
I can't do this.

440
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:11,855
You can't do what?

441
00:33:12,798 --> 00:33:13,973
Us.

442
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:18,299
This...

443
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,052
This relationship.

444
00:33:23,990 --> 00:33:25,523
What are you talking about?

445
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:28,180
How can I?

446
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:32,591
I can't look after you.

447
00:33:32,918 --> 00:33:34,960
I haven't got a job.
I don't have any...

448
00:33:35,649 --> 00:33:38,461
I can't even afford 5
quid for a bloody photograph.

449
00:33:40,752 --> 00:33:42,389
You deserve someone better.

450
00:33:42,870 --> 00:33:45,739
I know what I deserve.
I chose to be with you. I love you.

451
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:49,035
Love's not enough.
Being a good man is not enough.

452
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,754
What's this about, Des?
Where's this coming from?

453
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:55,029
It's all happening too soon--
you moving in,

454
00:33:56,127 --> 00:33:57,997
you're painting rooms,
you're changing things.

455
00:33:58,055 --> 00:33:59,449
I don't even like red.

456
00:34:00,096 --> 00:34:02,396
And why would you leave your flat--
your expensive flat--

457
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,808
Don't do that.

458
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:08,038
Don't you pretend you don't care,
and don't you dare rewrite history.

459
00:34:08,077 --> 00:34:11,789
I left my expensive flat 'cause you
were too proud to live there, remember?

460
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:17,926
If you want me to go,
if you want me to leave,

461
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:22,928
then don't make this about
what I do or don't deserve...

462
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,302
and have the decency to admit

463
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,377
that you're doing this
because you're a coward.

464
00:34:35,924 --> 00:34:37,021
I'm sorry.

465
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,450
But this...

466
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:51,878
we're not supposed to be together.

467
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:24,969
What'll it be?

468
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:33,749
Just give me a pint of your cheapest.

469
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,544
I'm celebratin'.

470
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,601
What's the occasion?

471
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:43,185
I think I've made
the biggest mistake of my life,

472
00:35:44,748 --> 00:35:45,961
and the worst part is...

473
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,457
I'm pretty sure I've made it before.

474
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,821
That's what they call déjà vu, mate.

475
00:35:52,705 --> 00:35:53,899
Do they now?

476
00:36:17,486 --> 00:36:18,892
I had the wrong night.

477
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,652
I was right.

478
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:23,717
I was off by a night.
I heard the song, and then...

479
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,015
I remember this.

480
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,543
I'm not crazy!

481
00:36:27,665 --> 00:36:28,994
I can still change things.

482
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,464
I can still change it.

483
00:36:34,129 --> 00:36:35,389
Jimmy Lennon.

484
00:36:35,390 --> 00:36:37,323
Where the hell's my money?

485
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:39,982
Hey, duck, brother!

486
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:08,625
Please...

487
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,123
let me go back.

488
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,689
Let me go back one more time.

489
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:19,256
I'll do it right.
I'll do it right this time.

490
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,790
I'm sorry, Penny.

491
00:38:26,898 --> 00:38:28,131
I'll change it.

492
00:38:30,298 --> 00:38:31,511
I'll change it.

493
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,233
How'd you know Claire was drowning?

494
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:40,158
Well, I could hear her calling for help.

495
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:43,984
You, uh, hear the lightning as well?

496
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:49,350
Just by chance, you pitched
your little rod outside Claire's tent,

497
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:51,895
and two hours later, lightning strikes.

498
00:38:58,633 --> 00:39:00,808
I don't know how you're doing
what it is you're doing,

499
00:39:00,866 --> 00:39:02,540
but I know a coward when I see one.

500
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,048
Yeah, a coward--

501
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,809
You don't want to know what happened
to me when I turned that key!

502
00:39:09,810 --> 00:39:11,530
- Get off!
- You don't want to know!

503
00:39:11,742 --> 00:39:14,053
You don't want to know
what happened to me.

504
00:39:14,447 --> 00:39:15,892
You don't want to know!

505
00:39:20,494 --> 00:39:23,094
- It doesn't matter what you do.
- What the hell are you doing?

506
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,573
You can't change it.

507
00:39:28,730 --> 00:39:31,780
No matter what you try to do,
you just can't change it.

508
00:39:35,209 --> 00:39:37,963
He's wankered.
Let's get him to his tent.

509
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:41,461
All right, Des, come on.
Give me your arm.

510
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,758
Come on. Stand up. Stand up!

511
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,507
You're a good man, Charlie.

512
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,939
Listen, I'm sorry I tried
to strangle you, all right?

513
00:39:56,498 --> 00:39:57,827
Fair play, mate. Here we go.

514
00:40:02,494 --> 00:40:03,977
Sorry I called you a coward.

515
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,458
Ah, you're all right, pal.

516
00:40:12,648 --> 00:40:14,690
You are gonna tell me
what happened to you.

517
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,494
When I turned that key...

518
00:40:29,361 --> 00:40:30,633
my life...

519
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:34,657
flashed before my eyes,

520
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,561
and then I was back in the jungle,

521
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,024
still on this bloody island.

522
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:45,799
But those flashes, Charlie...

523
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:49,489
those flashes--
they didn't stop.

524
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,297
So...

525
00:40:53,008 --> 00:40:57,390
you're telling me you saw a flash
of Claire drowning this morning?

526
00:40:57,710 --> 00:40:59,342
That's how you knew how to save her?

527
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,769
I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie.

528
00:41:04,405 --> 00:41:05,618
I was saving you.

529
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,207
This morning, you dove in after Claire.

530
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:18,010
You tried to save her, but...

531
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,314
you drowned.

532
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,835
What are you talking about?

533
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:29,592
I didn't drown.

534
00:41:30,302 --> 00:41:32,498
When I saw the lightninghit the roof,

535
00:41:33,712 --> 00:41:34,944
you were electrocuted.

536
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:39,505
And when you heard
Claire was in the water, you...

537
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:42,477
you drowned trying to save her.

538
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:46,489
I dove in myself,
so you never went in.

539
00:41:46,985 --> 00:41:49,797
I've tried, brother.
I've tried twice to save you, but...

540
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,530
the universe has a way
of course-correcting,

541
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,960
and I can't stop it forever.

542
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,288
I'm sorry. I'm sorry because...

543
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:09,056
no matter what I try to do...

544
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,635
you're gonna die, Charlie.
