<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,153 --> 00:00:04,227
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything, Pal.

3
00:00:04,441 --> 00:00:06,043
How do you know Claire was drowning?

4
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:24,684
I could hear her calling for help.

5
00:00:24,898 --> 00:00:25,906
You...

6
00:00:26,722 --> 00:00:28,253
Hear the lightning as well?

7
00:00:42,871 --> 00:00:44,731
I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie.

8
00:00:45,358 --> 00:00:46,423
I was saving you.

9
00:00:47,858 --> 00:00:49,969
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,

10
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,755
you were electrocuted,

11
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:55,815
and when you heard Claire
was in the water...

12
00:00:57,139 --> 00:00:58,956
You drowned trying to save her.

13
00:01:00,433 --> 00:01:02,983
I've tried, brother,
I've tried twice to save you,

14
00:01:03,048 --> 00:01:04,754
but no matter what I try to do...

15
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:09,238
You're gonna die, Charlie.

16
00:01:23,895 --> 00:01:25,050
You're insane, mate.

17
00:01:25,421 --> 00:01:28,419
Superman can fly
round the entire planet

18
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:30,010
in the blink of an eye.

19
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:32,526
Dude,
if we're going by a pure foot race,

20
00:01:33,127 --> 00:01:34,958
Supes would get dusted by the Flash.

21
00:01:34,983 --> 00:01:38,424
But why would the man of steel
agree to a sodding foot race?

22
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,511
Uh, for charity?

23
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:43,759
And Flash would totally win,
'cause he can, like,

24
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:45,665
vibrate through walls and stuff.

25
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,528
Vibration.

26
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:50,299
Well and what would Superman do
if he came against a wall?

27
00:01:50,422 --> 00:01:52,093
Well, no smashing allowed.

28
00:01:52,919 --> 00:01:54,552
No flying, no smashing.

29
00:01:54,587 --> 00:01:56,559
Any other restrictions
I need to know about?

30
00:01:56,624 --> 00:01:59,760
Perhaps we should fit superman
with a pair of kryptonite...

31
00:02:02,344 --> 00:02:03,442
The hell?

32
00:02:10,933 --> 00:02:12,736
No, don't! Don't touch it.

33
00:02:12,805 --> 00:02:15,177
- My God,my God!
- Just breathe.

34
00:02:15,755 --> 00:02:17,042
Looks like it's homemade.

35
00:02:17,107 --> 00:02:18,215
We've got to get back.

36
00:02:18,253 --> 00:02:20,014
- No! You help!
- I can't help!

37
00:02:21,871 --> 00:02:23,056
I'm sorry, mate.

38
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,317
<i>Here it is. Here it is.</i>

39
00:02:46,354 --> 00:02:48,908
<i>Superman can fly around
the entire planet...</i>

40
00:03:22,431 --> 00:03:23,431
Where's the wire?

41
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:27,197
Did you eat those mushrooms
Jack warned us about?

42
00:03:27,244 --> 00:03:28,244
Listen to me.

43
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:31,130
There's a wire,
a cable buried in the sand.

44
00:03:32,868 --> 00:03:34,572
Do you know what I'm talking about?

45
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:36,991
This is future crap, isn't it?

46
00:03:37,032 --> 00:03:38,762
The cable ! Do you know where it is?

47
00:03:40,492 --> 00:03:42,351
- This is important.
- Why?

48
00:03:45,288 --> 00:03:46,492
<i>Superman...</i>

49
00:03:52,556 --> 00:03:53,944
Because someone's coming.

50
00:04:02,195 --> 00:04:05,415
Subtitles: swsub.com

51
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,368
God tests our faith in many ways.

52
00:04:50,385 --> 00:04:53,162
So, as you well know,
we have our own test here...

53
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,280
A vow of silence that lasts
as long as we see fit.

54
00:04:58,523 --> 00:05:00,805
This challenges both one's patience...

55
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:02,576
and his faith.

56
00:05:04,448 --> 00:05:07,131
For some, it may last a week.

57
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:10,450
Those we're less sure about, a month.

58
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:13,215
Personally, Desmond,

59
00:05:14,342 --> 00:05:15,792
I never thought you'd last...

60
00:05:18,843 --> 00:05:20,560
and so now I stand corrected.

61
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:26,183
For whatever reason,
your path has led you here.

62
00:05:29,327 --> 00:05:30,715
And now you're one of us.

63
00:05:34,803 --> 00:05:35,885
Welcome, brother.

64
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:38,713
Thank you...

65
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:41,762
Brother.

66
00:05:49,201 --> 00:05:50,201
Morning, Jack.

67
00:05:54,523 --> 00:05:56,798
Must be nice
to wake up in your own bed.

68
00:05:58,552 --> 00:06:00,346
Home, sweet home.

69
00:06:01,496 --> 00:06:04,031
So I was wondering
if I could borrow your first aid kit.

70
00:06:06,126 --> 00:06:07,199
I've...

71
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:08,761
twisted my ankle.

72
00:06:13,436 --> 00:06:15,908
- You want me to take a look at it?
- No, you're all right.

73
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,676
I've taped my share of ankles.

74
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:20,762
Right.

75
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:25,748
Thanks.

76
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,240
Something wrong, Hurley?

77
00:06:31,374 --> 00:06:33,039
No, just...

78
00:06:34,452 --> 00:06:35,764
keeping Desmond here company

79
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:39,114
'cause we're friends.

80
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,951
Bring that back when
you're done with it, okay?

81
00:06:43,952 --> 00:06:44,952
Absolutely.

82
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:48,974
What the hell was that?

83
00:06:49,261 --> 00:06:50,933
Do you want him to get suspicious?

84
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,065
Suspicious of what?

85
00:06:54,703 --> 00:06:57,398
Oh, this is like when you knew
Claire was drowning, isn't it?

86
00:06:57,553 --> 00:07:00,166
That's why you got the first aid kit.
Someone's gonna get hurt.

87
00:07:00,303 --> 00:07:02,909
- Is it me?
- No. It's just a precaution.

88
00:07:03,052 --> 00:07:05,677
Look, dude, you want me
to take you to the wire?

89
00:07:05,678 --> 00:07:06,900
I want an explanation.

90
00:07:16,658 --> 00:07:18,290
I saw a sequence of events...

91
00:07:19,494 --> 00:07:21,105
Things that are gonna happen.

92
00:07:21,596 --> 00:07:22,678
What'd you see?

93
00:07:23,024 --> 00:07:24,031
It was...

94
00:07:24,804 --> 00:07:26,804
It was like a sort of jigsaw puzzle,

95
00:07:27,662 --> 00:07:29,415
only I didn't have
the picture on the box,

96
00:07:29,453 --> 00:07:31,256
so I don't know
how the pieces fit exactly.

97
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,457
But one of the pieces.
The first one...

98
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:40,517
It was you,
pulling the cable out of the sand.

99
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:45,229
So what are the other pieces?

100
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:49,249
If I tell you that,
it'll change the picture on the box.

101
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,802
So what?

102
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:52,703
Isn't that the point...

103
00:07:52,802 --> 00:07:54,190
Preventing something bad?

104
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:55,869
Not this time.

105
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:59,128
So you're not trying to stop
something from happening.

106
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:02,345
You actually want it to happen.

107
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,045
More than anything.

108
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:26,352
Hey, Freckles, you home?

109
00:08:28,093 --> 00:08:30,121
Thought you weren't
allowed to use nicknames.

110
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,363
You weren't around
when I lost the bet,

111
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:35,928
so you're...

112
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:39,427
exempt.

113
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:45,804
What's up?

114
00:08:47,086 --> 00:08:48,867
I wanted to ask you something.

115
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:53,993
I'm up here.

116
00:08:59,243 --> 00:09:00,354
So did you tell him?

117
00:09:00,928 --> 00:09:02,159
Did I tell who what?

118
00:09:02,993 --> 00:09:03,993
You know.

119
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:06,204
Did you tell the doc...

120
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:08,430
about you and me?

121
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:14,869
But he knows.

122
00:09:15,616 --> 00:09:18,104
He saw us on one
of their surveillance monitors.

123
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:19,546
She said the camera was broken.

124
00:09:19,618 --> 00:09:21,268
Well, they had another camera.

125
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,062
Perverts.

126
00:09:23,804 --> 00:09:25,609
Anyway, he knows.

127
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:29,537
Well, now that that's outta the way...

128
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:33,646
How about a little afternoon delight?

129
00:09:37,207 --> 00:09:38,710
That means sex.

130
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:41,029
Come on, Freckles, wait. Now...

131
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:43,550
Do you need me
to make you a mix tape?

132
00:09:43,551 --> 00:09:45,106
Yeah, why don't you do that?

133
00:09:53,548 --> 00:09:55,370
Dude, you're gonna have
to tell me again.

134
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:56,952
What do we need Jin for?

135
00:09:57,117 --> 00:09:58,728
Because he was there with us.

136
00:09:59,553 --> 00:10:01,553
On the beach,
when I find the cable?

137
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:04,701
<i>This way. Here it is.</i>

138
00:10:05,401 --> 00:10:06,425
That's right.

139
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:08,156
In one of your puzzle flashes?

140
00:10:09,492 --> 00:10:10,492
Aye.

141
00:10:13,554 --> 00:10:15,632
So... If he doesn't come,

142
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:20,239
then neither does the someone
you won't tell me anything about.

143
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:22,373
That'd be the long and short of it,

144
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,367
but I've no bloody idea
how I'm gonna get him to come with us.

145
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,052
Watch the master.

146
00:10:38,444 --> 00:10:39,468
- Camping?
- Yeah,

147
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:41,660
you know, like,
sleeping under the stars,

148
00:10:41,802 --> 00:10:44,878
fire on the beach, marshmallows.

149
00:10:46,884 --> 00:10:47,896
Camping.

150
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,808
Everybody likes marshmallows.

151
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,426
Good man.

152
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:01,834
Get food, water.

153
00:11:03,114 --> 00:11:04,225
Where are you going?

154
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:05,302
We need one more.

155
00:11:08,427 --> 00:11:09,927
How daft do you think I am?

156
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:12,181
This isn't a camping trip.

157
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:16,531
You've had another one
of your visions, haven't you?

158
00:11:18,165 --> 00:11:19,470
What was it this time?

159
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:24,085
Someone's coming to the island.

160
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:25,989
Coming?

161
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,917
As in someone who's not already here?

162
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:29,710
How the hell is that gonna happen?

163
00:11:31,552 --> 00:11:32,552
I can't tell you.

164
00:11:35,228 --> 00:11:37,084
It's got nothing to do with me?

165
00:11:37,295 --> 00:11:40,225
Well, you're a part of it, yeah,
as are Jin and Hurley.

166
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,112
Right, but with all due respect,

167
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:45,859
you haven't previously told
Jin or Hurley that they're gonna die.

168
00:11:48,406 --> 00:11:50,744
Well, that's not gonna happen,
not this time.

169
00:11:58,832 --> 00:12:00,147
Can I bring my guitar?

170
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:02,928
Absolutely.

171
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,363
All right, I'm in.

172
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:10,365
You had me worried there for a second.

173
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:40,843
This is it.

174
00:12:43,613 --> 00:12:44,994
Well, how can you tell?

175
00:12:45,525 --> 00:12:48,198
'Cause that's exactly where
I followed the wire into the jungle.

176
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:49,841
Where is it, then?

177
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,990
Wait to go, dude§

178
00:12:59,742 --> 00:13:00,742
Here it is !

179
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:04,699
<i>Here it is!</i>

180
00:13:05,165 --> 00:13:06,739
<i>The beacon fell this side of the rise.</i>

181
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
Just one thing...

182
00:13:07,983 --> 00:13:09,927
Last time I followed this wire
into the jungle,

183
00:13:09,928 --> 00:13:13,135
I almost got kebabbed by one
of Rousseau's spiky death trap things.

184
00:13:15,203 --> 00:13:16,602
<i>Cut her down.</i>

185
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,242
We're not going in the jungle!

186
00:13:18,301 --> 00:13:19,301
Well, not yet.

187
00:13:20,122 --> 00:13:23,624
It's getting late, so,
we'll camp here the night.

188
00:13:25,115 --> 00:13:26,115
Camp.

189
00:13:29,932 --> 00:13:31,274
So when do they get here...

190
00:13:32,887 --> 00:13:34,236
your mysterious someone?

191
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:36,698
Soon.

192
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:48,609
You do realize you are free
to talk again, brother Desmond?

193
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:54,170
Used to being quiet, I suppose.

194
00:13:56,077 --> 00:13:57,197
Moriah.

195
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,380
I find the name

196
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,649
the brothers have chosen
for the wine made here...

197
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,196
interesting.

198
00:14:05,891 --> 00:14:07,244
And why is that, brother?

199
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:10,629
Well, Moriah is the mountain
where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac.

200
00:14:12,572 --> 00:14:14,127
It's not exactly the most...

201
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,793
festive locale, is it?

202
00:14:16,087 --> 00:14:18,181
And yet God spared Isaac.

203
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:20,586
Well, one might argue that...

204
00:14:21,243 --> 00:14:24,651
God need not have asked Abraham
to sacrifice his son in the first place.

205
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,413
Well, then it wouldn't have been
much of a test, would it, brother?

206
00:14:29,966 --> 00:14:32,633
Perhaps you underestimate
the value of sacrifice.

207
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,124
Brother Desmond!

208
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:37,964
I met this man waiting at the gates.

209
00:14:37,975 --> 00:14:39,663
He says he needs
to have a word with you.

210
00:14:46,227 --> 00:14:47,227
Sorry, sir.

211
00:14:56,737 --> 00:14:57,995
Forgive me, brother.

212
00:15:19,066 --> 00:15:20,390
The oatmeal's awesome.

213
00:15:20,917 --> 00:15:21,917
It is, huh?

214
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:26,228
It's strange, huh?

215
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:29,042
What's that?

216
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,401
Being back,

217
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:32,232
not...

218
00:15:33,101 --> 00:15:35,040
looking for a way out of a cage,

219
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,956
not finding a reason to go running off
into the jungle again.

220
00:15:39,475 --> 00:15:41,552
I almost don't know
what to do with myself.

221
00:15:42,163 --> 00:15:43,163
Well, enjoy it.

222
00:15:43,909 --> 00:15:46,157
I'm sure something
will go wrong soon enough.

223
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:54,419
Well, my big, dangerous
adventure for tonight

224
00:15:54,477 --> 00:15:57,709
is gonna be
doing the dishes in the ocean.

225
00:15:58,868 --> 00:16:00,657
- Well, be careful.
- I'll try.

226
00:16:04,503 --> 00:16:05,752
Can I borrow that spoon?

227
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,126
Thanks.

228
00:16:24,932 --> 00:16:25,955
Good night.

229
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:27,476
Yeah, good night.

230
00:16:56,556 --> 00:16:58,293
What, my doorbell busted again?

231
00:17:00,709 --> 00:17:01,986
What the hell are you doing?

232
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:04,706
Shut up and don't talk.

233
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,167
You crying?

234
00:17:15,227 --> 00:17:16,732
I said shut up.

235
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:25,726
You got it.

236
00:18:19,021 --> 00:18:20,964
Dude, I love the part about the bird.

237
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:22,885
It was a bird, right?

238
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,228
- You.
- Me?

239
00:18:26,512 --> 00:18:29,590
Have you heard the one
about the chupacabra?

240
00:18:30,714 --> 00:18:31,725
Chupa?

241
00:18:31,792 --> 00:18:34,069
Yeah, it's like a bear with spines,

242
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:35,631
but Mexican...

243
00:18:35,665 --> 00:18:36,665
Thanks.

244
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
Who's that?

245
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:49,415
Her name's Penny.

246
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:53,166
That's not bad, Des, not bad at all.

247
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:57,288
So how did you manage
to leave her behind and come here?

248
00:19:00,285 --> 00:19:01,451
Because I'm a coward.

249
00:19:03,355 --> 00:19:04,398
Sorry.

250
00:19:06,035 --> 00:19:07,266
You and me both, pal.

251
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,971
You know,
I tried to run away from her, and she...

252
00:19:12,035 --> 00:19:13,153
She tracked me down.

253
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:17,379
"With enough money and determination,

254
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,819
you can find anyone," she said.

255
00:19:21,850 --> 00:19:23,861
You know,
I used to get through my nights

256
00:19:25,494 --> 00:19:28,386
thinking that she actually meant it,
that she never gave up...

257
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,609
that maybe she spent
the last three years...

258
00:19:34,911 --> 00:19:35,911
looking for me.

259
00:19:45,818 --> 00:19:46,898
What's that?

260
00:19:59,174 --> 00:20:00,386
Is that a helicopter?

261
00:20:00,777 --> 00:20:01,850
Rescue.

262
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:13,524
Is that how a helicopter's
supposed to sound?

263
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:38,574
We gotta go out there.

264
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:40,436
- Out there?
- Well, yeah.

265
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,910
In what?

266
00:20:41,976 --> 00:20:43,531
Well, we gotta do something.

267
00:20:45,349 --> 00:20:46,353
Look.

268
00:20:47,724 --> 00:20:48,724
Look!

269
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,160
My god.

270
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,552
No dude, it's not a food drop.
You saw the beacon thing.

271
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:14,962
Someone, like, ejected.

272
00:21:15,026 --> 00:21:16,435
Yeah, but that was a helicopter.

273
00:21:16,436 --> 00:21:18,324
You can't eject from a helicopter.

274
00:21:19,057 --> 00:21:21,869
Well, maybe they jumped.
All that matters is that they're here.

275
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:24,141
"They"?
How do we even know it's a person?

276
00:21:24,289 --> 00:21:26,491
Because he said "someone" was coming.

277
00:21:29,055 --> 00:21:30,322
Where are you going?

278
00:21:30,685 --> 00:21:31,851
Out to where it fell.

279
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,494
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, slow down.

280
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:37,061
We're not gonna trudge out
into the jungle

281
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:38,976
- in the middle of the night.
- Yes, we are.

282
00:21:39,168 --> 00:21:42,679
Were you even listening to Hurley
when he mentioned Rousseau's death trap?

283
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,897
Now it's gonna be light in two hours.

284
00:21:44,935 --> 00:21:46,748
- We'll wait until...
- She can't wait.

285
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:48,935
She?

286
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,420
They. Whoever it is...

287
00:21:51,187 --> 00:21:52,187
could be hurt.

288
00:21:52,698 --> 00:21:54,595
We have to go all four of us now.

289
00:21:55,377 --> 00:21:56,377
Why?

290
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,232
Because that's the way
it's supposed to happen.

291
00:22:01,961 --> 00:22:05,116
Right. Well, I guess
it's supposed to happen without me.

292
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,381
<i>Superman...</i>

293
00:22:24,058 --> 00:22:25,706
We'll leave at first light, then...

294
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,810
together.

295
00:22:31,722 --> 00:22:32,774
Terrific.

296
00:22:41,236 --> 00:22:42,309
Is your sister in?

297
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:47,467
Leave. Now.

298
00:22:49,734 --> 00:22:50,995
Let him be, Derek.

299
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:58,808
Hello, Ruth.

300
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,788
So you're a monk now, are you?

301
00:23:05,901 --> 00:23:08,492
Well, technically
I'm still what they call a novice,

302
00:23:08,811 --> 00:23:11,177
- till the abbott says...
- Why are you here, Desmond?

303
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,710
Well, now that my initiation is done...

304
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:19,621
I felt like I owed you an explanation.

305
00:23:22,861 --> 00:23:26,326
You can never begin
to explain what you did.

306
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:29,365
You left one week before the wedding.

307
00:23:29,494 --> 00:23:31,758
Everything was planned,
bought and paid for.

308
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,800
You just disappeared completely.

309
00:23:35,245 --> 00:23:36,308
I had a calling.

310
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:40,540
We dated for six years,
and the closest you ever came

311
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:43,814
to a religious experience
was Celtic winning the cup.

312
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:47,648
Yes, I was scared about the wedding,

313
00:23:48,183 --> 00:23:50,643
so I had a few pints, too many, maybe.

314
00:23:53,186 --> 00:23:56,376
I raised my eyes, and I asked,

315
00:23:58,434 --> 00:24:00,045
"am I doing the right thing?"

316
00:24:01,244 --> 00:24:03,014
And that's the last thing I remember.

317
00:24:03,183 --> 00:24:05,868
And when I woke up,
I was lying on my back

318
00:24:05,952 --> 00:24:08,525
in the street,
and I don't know how I got there.

319
00:24:08,934 --> 00:24:12,492
And there was this man standing over me,

320
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,174
and he reached out his hand
and he said to me,

321
00:24:18,246 --> 00:24:19,748
"can I help you, brother?"

322
00:24:20,687 --> 00:24:22,344
And the first thing I noticed was...

323
00:24:22,687 --> 00:24:24,455
the rope tied around his waist,

324
00:24:25,544 --> 00:24:26,821
and I looked at him and...

325
00:24:27,601 --> 00:24:29,146
I knew...

326
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,762
I was supposed to go with him.

327
00:24:33,196 --> 00:24:34,567
I was supposed to leave...

328
00:24:36,748 --> 00:24:38,525
everything that mattered behind.

329
00:24:39,997 --> 00:24:41,219
Sacrifice all of it...

330
00:24:42,855 --> 00:24:44,217
for a greater calling.

331
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:52,145
Well, it's a good thing
a bloody shepherd didn't help you up,

332
00:24:52,716 --> 00:24:55,231
or I suppose you'd be off
with the sheep, wouldn't you?

333
00:24:58,183 --> 00:25:00,699
Next time you want to break up
with someone, Des,

334
00:25:02,438 --> 00:25:03,772
don't join a monastery.

335
00:25:04,934 --> 00:25:08,344
Just tell the girl
you're too bloody scared.

336
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,604
You a doctor or a carpenter?

337
00:25:20,196 --> 00:25:22,562
What, your dad never taught you
to use a hammer?

338
00:25:23,307 --> 00:25:25,195
No, my dad taught me how to drink.

339
00:25:25,746 --> 00:25:27,305
Well, at least it's something.

340
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:31,814
Hope I'm not interrupting.

341
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:35,600
You two arguing over
who's your favorite other?

342
00:25:36,498 --> 00:25:37,746
What do you want, Sawyer?

343
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:40,245
Oh, what I wanted, doc,
was to inform you

344
00:25:40,291 --> 00:25:42,882
there's been some developments
since you were A.W.O.L.

345
00:25:44,561 --> 00:25:45,561
So tell me...

346
00:25:49,686 --> 00:25:50,797
how's your backhand?

347
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:55,873
Where'd you get the table?

348
00:25:56,057 --> 00:25:57,334
Don't you recognize it?

349
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,388
It fell out of the purple haze
when the hatch went blammo.

350
00:26:01,047 --> 00:26:02,780
If we don't play every 108 minutes,

351
00:26:03,556 --> 00:26:05,153
the island's gonna explode.

352
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,600
Finally, something I can beat you at.

353
00:26:12,858 --> 00:26:15,597
You know, considering
I haven't played since I was 12,

354
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:17,435
I wouldn't be too proud.

355
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:20,638
What is that, 18-point?

356
00:26:22,923 --> 00:26:24,161
It's kinda strange, huh...

357
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:26,740
being back?

358
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:29,798
Something funny?

359
00:26:31,064 --> 00:26:33,305
Kate said the same thing
in the kitchen last night.

360
00:26:34,876 --> 00:26:36,971
- She did?
- She did.

361
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
19-point.

362
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:48,169
So you guys ate together, huh?

363
00:26:48,754 --> 00:26:50,857
No, Juliet and I had dinner together
last night.

364
00:27:02,627 --> 00:27:03,849
Best two out of three?

365
00:27:05,876 --> 00:27:06,876
You got it.

366
00:27:10,722 --> 00:27:11,746
So what's next?

367
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:12,875
Next?

368
00:27:13,251 --> 00:27:16,683
Yeah, you saw the wire,
the flashy thing falling out of the sky.

369
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,254
Now what?

370
00:27:18,292 --> 00:27:20,168
- Maybe I can help you find...
- That's it.

371
00:27:20,393 --> 00:27:21,503
There is no next.

372
00:27:22,441 --> 00:27:23,496
We find the beacon.

373
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,447
Why are you lying to me, mate?

374
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,686
Look, mate,

375
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:29,566
I've saved your life three times now.

376
00:27:30,206 --> 00:27:32,713
If that hasn't bought me your trust,
I don't know what will.

377
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,255
Let's move.

378
00:27:44,948 --> 00:27:45,990
Dude...

379
00:27:46,878 --> 00:27:48,631
seriously, I'm gonna have a coronary.

380
00:27:48,754 --> 00:27:51,250
Actually, you're not,
and if you don't get a move on,

381
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:53,335
we're not gonna make it
before nightfall...

382
00:27:54,081 --> 00:27:55,191
Look at this!

383
00:27:58,348 --> 00:27:59,560
It can't be Rousseau's.

384
00:27:59,899 --> 00:28:02,926
If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock
would be flying at my head right now.

385
00:28:04,969 --> 00:28:06,032
Don't move.

386
00:28:06,335 --> 00:28:07,847
- What are you doing?
- Don't move.

387
00:28:16,674 --> 00:28:19,247
Did that come down
with the flashing red light thingy?

388
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,026
Walkie-talkie.

389
00:28:27,209 --> 00:28:29,345
No, dude, that's a satellite phone.

390
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:34,751
Crap, it's dead.

391
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:36,459
Shocker.

392
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:45,263
My God.

393
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,218
Is that you?

394
00:28:52,459 --> 00:28:53,487
Then who's she?

395
00:28:55,074 --> 00:28:56,858
That would be Penny.

396
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:14,744
What's this?

397
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:16,105
Your mix tape.

398
00:29:20,945 --> 00:29:22,686
Well, you gonna take it, or ain't you?

399
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:26,638
"The best of Phil Collins," huh?

400
00:29:26,715 --> 00:29:27,767
Don't get picky.

401
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,979
And if Bernard asks,
I don't know a thing about it.

402
00:29:31,573 --> 00:29:32,643
Thanks, James.

403
00:29:35,069 --> 00:29:36,846
So why'd you jump me last night?

404
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,569
What?

405
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:42,206
Was it 'cause you saw the doc
hanging out with Juliet?

406
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:45,882
It is not like that.

407
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:47,257
It's not?

408
00:29:49,436 --> 00:29:51,117
You ain't gotta use me, Freckles.

409
00:29:52,259 --> 00:29:53,535
All you gotta do is ask.

410
00:30:05,714 --> 00:30:07,122
You think it's her, don't you?

411
00:30:08,634 --> 00:30:09,634
Who?

412
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:12,981
Your girl... Penny.

413
00:30:14,275 --> 00:30:17,524
You think it's actually her
who bailed out of the helicopter.

414
00:30:18,106 --> 00:30:19,251
Earlier I hoped it.

415
00:30:21,006 --> 00:30:22,006
Now I know it.

416
00:30:25,999 --> 00:30:27,229
Why didn't you tell us?

417
00:30:27,945 --> 00:30:29,278
Would you come if I had?

418
00:30:30,133 --> 00:30:31,133
Of course.

419
00:30:31,258 --> 00:30:32,258
Why wouldn't I?

420
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:35,546
I didn't wanna tell you because...

421
00:30:37,508 --> 00:30:39,128
I didn't want anything to change.

422
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:41,022
Fair enough.

423
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:44,883
Look, if whatever you're seeing
leads to your girl getting us rescued,

424
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,006
why would we want to change anything?

425
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:48,318
Right?

426
00:30:49,571 --> 00:30:50,571
Right.

427
00:30:59,217 --> 00:31:00,318
Right.

428
00:31:06,743 --> 00:31:09,644
Thanks for the heads-up
about bringing an umbrella, dude.

429
00:31:35,453 --> 00:31:36,610
Brother Desmond?

430
00:31:37,618 --> 00:31:38,728
What are you doing?

431
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:43,855
Well, I believe I'm...
getting pissed on our lovely wine.

432
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:48,892
That bottle of our lovely wine
fetches over 100 quid.

433
00:31:50,094 --> 00:31:52,341
We've only bottled 108 cases this year.

434
00:31:53,924 --> 00:31:57,098
It's just as well we've taken
a vow of poverty then, isn't it?

435
00:31:57,673 --> 00:31:59,561
We've also taken a vow of charity.

436
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:03,609
Right.

437
00:32:13,424 --> 00:32:16,594
Something tells me, Desmond,
that you're not cut out to be a monk.

438
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:20,302
Well, you know, I've had a tough week.

439
00:32:27,609 --> 00:32:28,886
I'm sorry for the wine.

440
00:32:31,312 --> 00:32:32,486
I'll take the penance.

441
00:32:33,545 --> 00:32:35,714
I'm afraid
you're beyond penance, Desmond.

442
00:32:37,484 --> 00:32:38,484
Brother Desmond.

443
00:32:40,421 --> 00:32:41,421
Not anymore.

444
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:46,372
Are you firing me?

445
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,298
I am indeed.

446
00:32:50,798 --> 00:32:51,798
You can't do that.

447
00:32:52,573 --> 00:32:54,851
- I heard the call.
- I'm sure you did hear the call,

448
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:58,044
but the abbey clearly isn't where
you are meant to end up.

449
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,957
I have little doubt that God
has different plans

450
00:33:01,013 --> 00:33:03,867
than you being a monk, Desmond...
bigger plans.

451
00:33:04,171 --> 00:33:05,928
- Aye, sure he does.
- He does.

452
00:33:07,628 --> 00:33:09,624
You've just spent
too much time running away

453
00:33:09,718 --> 00:33:12,038
to realize
what you may be running toward.

454
00:33:31,484 --> 00:33:33,095
What am I supposed to do now?

455
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:36,096
Whatever comes next.

456
00:33:51,046 --> 00:33:52,109
Who's Penny?

457
00:33:52,924 --> 00:33:54,868
She's a chick Desmond used to date,

458
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:57,340
and now he thinks she fell from the sky.

459
00:33:57,484 --> 00:34:00,804
So we're gonna go save her life,
and she's gonna get us rescued.

460
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:09,648
Dude, even if I spoke korean,
it wouldn't make any sense.

461
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:12,174
We'll move faster if we stop talking.

462
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:13,364
She might be hurt.

463
00:34:14,301 --> 00:34:15,660
I'm moving as fast as I can.

464
00:34:16,226 --> 00:34:18,978
In case you haven't noticed, dude,
I'm not exactly the Flash.

465
00:34:19,181 --> 00:34:20,524
The Flash is pathetic.

466
00:34:22,052 --> 00:34:24,502
You got something
against the fastest man alive?

467
00:34:25,235 --> 00:34:26,411
You're insane, mate!

468
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:30,034
Superman can fly around the entire
planet in the blink of an eye.

469
00:34:30,177 --> 00:34:32,395
Dude, if we're going
by a pure foot race,

470
00:34:32,676 --> 00:34:34,426
Supes would get dusted by the Flash.

471
00:34:34,586 --> 00:34:37,957
But why would the man of steel
agree to a sodding foot race?

472
00:34:38,302 --> 00:34:39,553
Uh, for charity?

473
00:34:39,647 --> 00:34:41,667
The Flash would totally win,
'cause he can, like,

474
00:34:41,681 --> 00:34:43,104
vibrate through walls and stuff.

475
00:34:43,176 --> 00:34:44,361
Vibration!

476
00:34:44,545 --> 00:34:46,892
And what would Superman do
if he came up against a wall?

477
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:48,704
Well, no smashing allowed.

478
00:34:51,037 --> 00:34:53,159
No flying, no smashing.

479
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:55,535
Any other restrictions
I need to know about?

480
00:34:57,717 --> 00:35:01,594
Perhaps we should fit Superman with
a pair of kryptonite ballet slippers...

481
00:35:04,463 --> 00:35:05,515
The hell?

482
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,414
Charlie, duck!

483
00:35:20,749 --> 00:35:21,754
Dude.

484
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,060
This way.

485
00:35:35,144 --> 00:35:36,903
No, the beacon
fell this side of the rise.

486
00:35:36,955 --> 00:35:37,955
No, there.

487
00:35:39,456 --> 00:35:40,621
How about we split up?

488
00:35:40,837 --> 00:35:43,006
Me and Charlie'll go that way.
You and Jin go around,

489
00:35:43,098 --> 00:35:44,873
and we'll meet up
at that ridge over there.

490
00:35:46,241 --> 00:35:47,274
You and Jin.

491
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,978
I'll stick with Desmond.

492
00:35:59,643 --> 00:36:00,694
You said "duck."

493
00:36:01,849 --> 00:36:04,089
- Sorry?
- You shouted, "duck."

494
00:36:06,276 --> 00:36:08,605
You knew, even before we set off.

495
00:36:08,988 --> 00:36:10,954
- You knew all this time, didn't you?
- Aye.

496
00:36:11,209 --> 00:36:12,712
Then, why didn't you say anything?

497
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,133
Because if I told you the truth,
you wouldn't have come.

498
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:18,863
Oh, you need me to come
'cause I was part of your vision.

499
00:36:19,132 --> 00:36:21,296
You thought the only way
you could get your girl back

500
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:22,845
was if took an arrow in the head.

501
00:36:24,269 --> 00:36:25,565
You were gonna sacrifice me.

502
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,261
If the flashes don't happen exactly
as I saw them,

503
00:36:29,143 --> 00:36:30,254
the picture changes.

504
00:36:32,777 --> 00:36:34,805
I was supposed to let you die, Charlie.

505
00:36:35,144 --> 00:36:36,416
What's that supposed to mean?

506
00:36:36,581 --> 00:36:38,193
It means it's bloody pointless.

507
00:36:39,581 --> 00:36:42,452
I keep saving your life,
and what good has it done?

508
00:36:42,763 --> 00:36:44,828
It's just gonna keep happening
again and again.

509
00:36:44,889 --> 00:36:46,068
Maybe that's the point, yeah?

510
00:36:46,105 --> 00:36:48,190
- Maybe it's a test.
- A test?

511
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:50,836
Like God testing Abraham,
except I failed...

512
00:36:52,471 --> 00:36:54,124
Because I changed what I saw.

513
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:12,427
Hey, can you hear me?

514
00:37:19,272 --> 00:37:20,643
Dude, she's not moving.

515
00:37:24,055 --> 00:37:25,055
I'm sorry, Penny.

516
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:27,801
I'm sorry.

517
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:45,298
I was afraid you'd left
without saying good-bye.

518
00:37:46,114 --> 00:37:47,114
No.

519
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:51,092
I nearly took this with me.

520
00:37:55,379 --> 00:37:56,708
If you're not in a hurry,

521
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:59,392
brother Martin's
heading into town in a few hours.

522
00:37:59,554 --> 00:38:00,718
He can give you a ride.

523
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:04,814
That is, if you don't mind
doing some heavy lifting.

524
00:38:07,303 --> 00:38:09,153
All ten cases are ready to go.

525
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,323
Desmond there
is just getting the last one.

526
00:38:12,805 --> 00:38:15,444
Thank you,
and my father sent the check in advance?

527
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,829
And please thank him
for his generous donation.

528
00:38:18,117 --> 00:38:19,728
Always a pleasure to see you.

529
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:24,305
Good-bye, Desmond.

530
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:34,451
I think we should be able
to fit it all in the back,

531
00:38:34,489 --> 00:38:36,354
and if not,
we'll put the rest in the front.

532
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:39,990
Is that all right?

533
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,490
Absolutely.

534
00:38:56,304 --> 00:38:57,713
You'd better drive safe, miss.

535
00:38:58,498 --> 00:39:01,491
This vineyard only makes a limited
number of these cases each year.

536
00:39:02,409 --> 00:39:03,470
Is that so?

537
00:39:03,517 --> 00:39:05,484
Aye. It's because the monks are lazy.

538
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:09,413
You know, it's easier
making grape jelly than wine.

539
00:39:10,172 --> 00:39:12,247
And how do you know so much
about monks?

540
00:39:12,416 --> 00:39:13,505
I'm an ex-monk.

541
00:39:13,643 --> 00:39:14,678
Really?

542
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,740
As of last night.

543
00:39:17,365 --> 00:39:18,365
I was fired.

544
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:22,056
Well, it wasn't that funny.

545
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:24,319
I'm sorry. I've never... I've...

546
00:39:24,535 --> 00:39:26,187
I didn't know monks could be fired.

547
00:39:26,428 --> 00:39:27,428
Oh, they can.

548
00:39:28,239 --> 00:39:30,582
You know, I was told
in no uncertain terms

549
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,671
that the abbey
wasn't where I was meant to end up,

550
00:39:34,115 --> 00:39:35,115
just a...

551
00:39:36,163 --> 00:39:37,327
step along the path.

552
00:39:37,515 --> 00:39:40,069
You know,
God allegedly has bigger plans for me.

553
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:48,041
Something tells me
you don't entirely believe that.

554
00:39:48,107 --> 00:39:49,571
I suspect that's because I don't.

555
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,383
Well, maybe they're right.

556
00:39:51,418 --> 00:39:53,113
I just think,
if you hadn't gotten fired,

557
00:39:53,114 --> 00:39:54,583
we wouldn't have met,
and then...

558
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:58,198
how could you possibly help me
unload these crates in Carlisle?

559
00:39:59,887 --> 00:40:01,907
Did I say
I was coming to Carlisle with you?

560
00:40:02,824 --> 00:40:03,824
Not yet.

561
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:17,282
I mean, of course,
if an ex-monk already has plans...

562
00:40:17,387 --> 00:40:19,821
You know, I don't usually get into cars
with strangers.

563
00:40:20,135 --> 00:40:21,968
Well, in that case, I'm Penelope.

564
00:40:24,949 --> 00:40:25,949
Penny.

565
00:40:28,011 --> 00:40:29,011
Desmond.

566
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:33,211
Very nice to meet you, Penny.

567
00:40:43,948 --> 00:40:44,948
She's alive.

568
00:40:47,249 --> 00:40:48,291
Stand back!

569
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:50,386
Get away from her!

570
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,813
I'm here. I'm here, Penny.

571
00:40:55,373 --> 00:40:57,326
- Be careful.
- Just get off, Charlie.

572
00:40:57,819 --> 00:40:59,435
Sorry, Penny. Sorry.

573
00:41:07,496 --> 00:41:08,576
Desmond?
