00:00:00,858 --> 00:00:02,503
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,783 --> 00:00:04,262
I don't know how it happenned,

3
00:00:04,598 --> 00:00:07,973
but you seem to have
some communion with this island, John.

4
00:00:08,709 --> 00:00:11,187
And that makes you very, very important.

5
00:00:11,397 --> 00:00:14,120
In time, you'll have
a better understanding of things.

6
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:18,263
Kwon is pregnant.

7
00:00:18,521 --> 00:00:19,798
<i>The fetus is healthy...</i>

8
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:21,472
What's that?

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:24,169
Juliet is gathering information for us
at your former camp.

10
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:26,482
She's determining if any of the women
are pregnant.

11
00:00:26,646 --> 00:00:29,879
Then we're gonna go in and... take them.

12
00:00:30,716 --> 00:00:31,833
Juliet is a mole.

13
00:00:32,424 --> 00:00:33,683
She's working for Ben.

14
00:00:35,946 --> 00:00:37,084
We're moving.

15
00:00:37,622 --> 00:00:40,430
- Moving? Where are we going?
- We are not going anywhere, John.

16
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,569
You are going to stay behind.

17
00:00:42,769 --> 00:00:44,524
We'll leave a trail...
One you can track.

18
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:45,992
And, John,

19
00:00:46,285 --> 00:00:48,974
unless you're carrying
your father's body on your back...

20
00:00:50,396 --> 00:00:51,462
don't bother.

21
00:00:57,505 --> 00:00:59,261
Come on! Damn it, push!

22
00:01:03,075 --> 00:01:04,296
Something's wrong.

23
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,578
I can't...

24
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:09,356
Emily...

25
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:10,777
you can do this!

26
00:01:10,974 --> 00:01:11,974
Now push!

27
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:13,887
Come on. Come on, baby.

28
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:15,535
You can do it. Now come on!

29
00:01:15,663 --> 00:01:18,091
Come on. There you go! Come on!

30
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:25,904
It's a boy.

31
00:01:27,149 --> 00:01:28,224
You did it.

32
00:01:30,272 --> 00:01:31,347
It hurts.

33
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,247
Oh, you did it.

34
00:01:44,459 --> 00:01:45,785
Roger, it hurts.

35
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:53,733
Emily, no one knows we're out here.

36
00:01:54,035 --> 00:01:55,722
We gotta get back, okay, honey?

37
00:01:55,862 --> 00:01:57,483
Can you hold on to the baby?

38
00:01:58,999 --> 00:02:00,410
Can you hold the baby?

39
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:01,722
Hold him tight.

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,908
Help! Help!

41
00:02:18,252 --> 00:02:19,496
Help!

42
00:02:20,844 --> 00:02:22,026
Help!

43
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:25,832
Come on. Help me.

44
00:02:27,111 --> 00:02:28,509
Hey, what happened, man?

45
00:02:29,636 --> 00:02:30,795
We were hiking.

46
00:02:30,921 --> 00:02:34,041
She went into labor,
and she wasn't due yet. She's bleeding.

47
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:36,217
Okay, look.
We'll put her in the car, okay?

48
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:38,067
We're gonna get you to the hospital.

49
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:39,932
Oh, okay. Okay, honey.

50
00:02:40,047 --> 00:02:42,348
- Okay, it's all right.
- Let's keep her warm. All right?

51
00:02:42,808 --> 00:02:45,118
- How's the baby?
- Fine, I guess. I don't know.

52
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,544
Roger...

53
00:02:48,552 --> 00:02:49,794
I'm right here.

54
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:51,156
Call him Benjamin...

55
00:02:52,111 --> 00:02:53,111
Stay with me.

56
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,721
Stay with me!

57
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:04,887
God, no!

58
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:14,289
What you got there?

59
00:03:14,923 --> 00:03:16,256
It's a birthday present.

60
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:18,649
Mine just happens to be today.

61
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:23,051
You do remember birthdays,
don't you, Richard?

62
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,109
So do you want me
to bring the tape back to Juliet?

63
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:29,376
- What?
- The tape

64
00:03:29,428 --> 00:03:30,902
with your instructions for Juliet...

65
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:33,160
Do you want me to bring it back
to the medical station?

66
00:03:33,191 --> 00:03:35,177
I recorded it yesterday before we left.

67
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,529
I thought you already took it!

68
00:03:38,504 --> 00:03:39,610
Where's Tom?

69
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:45,372
Have you seen my recorder?

70
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:13,477
You said that if I... killed my father,

71
00:04:14,864 --> 00:04:17,396
you'd tell me everything
I wanted to know about the island.

72
00:04:22,859 --> 00:04:24,911
So why don't you start at the beginning?

73
00:04:38,885 --> 00:04:42,418
Subtitles: swsub.com

74
00:04:47,437 --> 00:04:49,343
I know I promised
to tell you everything,

75
00:04:49,798 --> 00:04:51,256
and I wish it was as simple

76
00:04:51,318 --> 00:04:53,933
as me taking out a dusty old book
and opening it up.

77
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,388
But it's not that simple.

78
00:05:08,315 --> 00:05:09,815
How about you just tell me?

79
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:13,921
You probably think
I'm the leader of this little community,

80
00:05:14,665 --> 00:05:16,086
but that's not entirely true.

81
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,158
We all answer to someone, John.

82
00:05:20,413 --> 00:05:21,678
And who might that be?

83
00:05:24,188 --> 00:05:25,441
His name is Jacob.

84
00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,129
Okay, then.

85
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:29,313
Take me to Jacob.

86
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,500
I can't do that.

87
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:34,457
Where are you going?

88
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,768
If you don't want to take me,
maybe someone else will.

89
00:05:36,938 --> 00:05:38,652
I'll just go and ask Richard.

90
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:40,098
Why would Richard take you?

91
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:42,499
He doesn't know where Jacob is.
He doesn't talk to Jacob.

92
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,846
- Well, who talks to him?
- I do.

93
00:05:43,857 --> 00:05:46,064
- You're the only one who talks to him?
- That's right.

94
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:48,075
And no one else knows where he is?

95
00:05:48,689 --> 00:05:50,648
I was born here on this island.

96
00:05:51,313 --> 00:05:53,163
I'm one of the last that was.

97
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:54,690
Most of these people you see...

98
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:57,975
I brought them here,
so Jacob talks to me, John.

99
00:05:58,502 --> 00:06:01,297
He tells me what to do, trusts me.

100
00:06:01,877 --> 00:06:05,727
And no one else has ever seen him?

101
00:06:06,116 --> 00:06:07,254
That's right.

102
00:06:07,928 --> 00:06:09,003
How convenient.

103
00:06:09,854 --> 00:06:11,440
You know what I think, Ben?

104
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,444
I think there is no Jacob.

105
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,939
I think your people are idiots

106
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:18,717
if they believe you take orders
from someone else.

107
00:06:19,249 --> 00:06:21,514
You are the man behind the curtain...

108
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:24,306
the Wizard of Oz...

109
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:27,807
and you're a liar.

110
00:06:30,251 --> 00:06:32,494
And what might you base
that theory on, John?

111
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,738
Because if you were telling the truth,

112
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,541
your hand wouldn't be shaking.

113
00:07:15,313 --> 00:07:16,377
Namaste.

114
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,910
Thanks.

115
00:07:21,188 --> 00:07:23,268
Hey, welcome to the island, man.

116
00:07:25,564 --> 00:07:27,506
So what do you think?

117
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:30,668
Wow, this is some place.

118
00:07:30,944 --> 00:07:33,013
Thanks again for the opportunity,
Mr. Goodspeed.

119
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:34,062
Horace, please.

120
00:07:34,928 --> 00:07:36,170
And this must be Ben.

121
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:39,202
Yeah. Mr. Goodspeed was there
the day you were born.

122
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,625
Yes, I was.

123
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:43,280
He's doing us a big favor here.

124
00:07:43,627 --> 00:07:45,127
He gave your old man a job.

125
00:07:46,624 --> 00:07:48,877
- Uh, he don't say much.
- That's okay.

126
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:51,950
I bet he will when he has
something to say, right, Ben?

127
00:07:53,175 --> 00:07:54,452
Hey, you hungry, kiddo?

128
00:07:56,952 --> 00:07:59,008
Great. All right, well, I tell you what.

129
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,142
After you're done processing,
we'll have some lunch. How's that sound?

130
00:08:02,266 --> 00:08:03,266
Thank you.

131
00:08:03,453 --> 00:08:04,897
You're gonna love it here.

132
00:08:06,605 --> 00:08:07,927
<i>Welcome to the island.</i>

133
00:08:08,295 --> 00:08:09,883
<i>For your own comfort and safety,</i>

134
00:08:10,013 --> 00:08:13,066
<i>we ask that you stay within the
confines of your new living quarters.</i>

135
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:16,315
<i>Our barracks are surrounded
by a high-frequency sonar fence</i>

136
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:21,627
<i>to protect us from the island's
abundant and diverse wildlife.</i>

137
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,884
<i>You are now a member
of the Dharma Initiative.</i>

138
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,804
What kind of wildlife you think
this fence is protecting us from?

139
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:28,893
Roger Linus?

140
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,518
<i>Every morning you will be given
a new code</i>

141
00:08:33,617 --> 00:08:35,916
<i>which will allow you
to cross outside the fences</i>

142
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,291
<i>if you so desire.</i>

143
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:41,113
<i>There are properties on this island
that exist nowhere else on earth.</i>

144
00:08:41,677 --> 00:08:44,050
<i>Our mission is to study these properties</i>

145
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:48,062
<i>for the betterment of mankind
and advancement of world peace.</i>

146
00:08:48,482 --> 00:08:50,756
<i>Most of you
will be working on the mainland.</i>

147
00:08:51,203 --> 00:08:53,536
<i>Should you be assigned
geological study...</i>

148
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:55,502
Hey.

149
00:08:56,537 --> 00:08:57,648
You're new, huh?

150
00:08:59,892 --> 00:09:00,892
I'm Annie.

151
00:09:02,953 --> 00:09:03,953
Want one?

152
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:09,614
We can have as many as we want.

153
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:11,957
"Work man"?

154
00:09:13,078 --> 00:09:15,072
What is this? Workman?

155
00:09:17,336 --> 00:09:18,453
I'm a janitor?

156
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,832
I'm sorry, Mr. Linus.

157
00:09:20,004 --> 00:09:22,268
Goodspeed told me
you people were doing experiments,

158
00:09:22,269 --> 00:09:23,324
changing the world.

159
00:09:23,516 --> 00:09:25,279
I didn't come here
to clean up after you.

160
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:26,653
Look, if anything else opens up,

161
00:09:26,767 --> 00:09:28,275
you can feel free to apply for it.

162
00:09:31,882 --> 00:09:32,957
Come on.

163
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:52,877
- What happened to you?
- I was with Locke.

164
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:55,187
Where is he?

165
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
He went back.

166
00:09:56,877 --> 00:09:57,877
Back where?

167
00:09:58,002 --> 00:10:00,065
With them.
Don't ask me where the hell it is,

168
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:01,899
'cause it don't matter right now.

169
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,890
What does matter... is this.

170
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,730
Where is Ben?!

171
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,376
Where is he?!

172
00:10:23,814 --> 00:10:25,147
I thought you were dead.

173
00:10:26,977 --> 00:10:29,789
I'm fortunate the pylons
were not set to a lethal level.

174
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:35,300
What is he doing here?

175
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,971
- It's all right.
- He's the one who tried to kill me!

176
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:42,688
He's with us now.

177
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:46,022
Where have you been, Mikhail?

178
00:10:46,127 --> 00:10:48,656
I encountered several of his people
in the jungle.

179
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:51,378
They had an injured woman with them.

180
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,015
Apparently,
she had just parachuted onto the island.

181
00:10:54,127 --> 00:10:56,482
- What?
- Her helo crashed in the water.

182
00:10:57,563 --> 00:11:01,794
She says her ship is approximately
130 clicks to the west of us.

183
00:11:02,252 --> 00:11:04,564
- She has a radio-telephone.
- Where is she now?

184
00:11:05,064 --> 00:11:07,484
I assume they have taken her
back to their camp.

185
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:10,311
We'll be visiting their camp
day after tomorrow.

186
00:11:10,312 --> 00:11:12,489
- We'll take care of it then.
- Day after tomorrow?

187
00:11:12,751 --> 00:11:13,751
We have to go now.

188
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,826
Ben's not going anywhere with you.

189
00:11:17,063 --> 00:11:19,549
- Excuse me?
- He and I are going to see Jacob.

190
00:11:27,352 --> 00:11:29,212
Please tell me
this isn't true, Benjamin.

191
00:11:35,753 --> 00:11:37,796
Sorry. I have to deal
with this now, John.

192
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:39,715
Our excursion will have to wait.

193
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:43,520
Since when
do you explain yourself to him...

194
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:44,935
an outsider?

195
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,489
So when do we leave?

196
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,951
You know, you didn't have to beat him
senseless to make your point.

197
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,465
Yes, I did.

198
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:25,307
I hear you're gonna go see Jacob.

199
00:12:26,597 --> 00:12:27,874
You're gonna need this.

200
00:12:35,848 --> 00:12:36,848
Thanks.

201
00:12:44,035 --> 00:12:45,146
Happy birthday, dad.

202
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:02,676
So once water
is added to the bicarbonate,

203
00:13:02,972 --> 00:13:05,619
we will get
our very own volcanic reaction.

204
00:13:07,335 --> 00:13:08,347
Yes?

205
00:13:08,406 --> 00:13:10,684
Is that what happened
to the volcano on this island?

206
00:13:10,843 --> 00:13:14,345
Exactly, Annie,
but that was a long time ago.

207
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,021
Okay, let's get ourselves an eruption.

208
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:21,085
Just add water, and voilà.

209
00:13:21,336 --> 00:13:23,187
Now I know it's not lava, but...

210
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,384
What was that?!

211
00:13:31,035 --> 00:13:33,112
Okay, everyone, into your positions.

212
00:13:34,764 --> 00:13:35,998
Get over here!

213
00:13:36,588 --> 00:13:37,924
That's right, all together!

214
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,362
Annie, lock the back door, please.

215
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:45,454
Ben, come on, honey, you gotta move.

216
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,133
Come on!

217
00:13:59,508 --> 00:14:01,451
Don't worry. It's just the hostiles.

218
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:04,611
We'll be okay.

219
00:14:11,144 --> 00:14:13,179
Hey, man, I heard
you ran into a little trouble.

220
00:14:13,521 --> 00:14:16,831
We were driving back from the plane,
and we hear this huge explosion.

221
00:14:17,645 --> 00:14:19,916
Next thing I know,
there's a siren wailing,

222
00:14:20,004 --> 00:14:22,082
and we're driving through
the middle of a shootout.

223
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,387
Look, we're having some skirmishes
with the natives.

224
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:26,107
What do you mean, natives?

225
00:14:26,262 --> 00:14:28,394
We're not exactly sure who they are.

226
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:30,819
This ain't what I signed up for.

227
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:33,086
Roger, I did you a favor, man.

228
00:14:33,328 --> 00:14:34,937
You were having trouble finding work,

229
00:14:35,018 --> 00:14:38,011
and don't forget about Ben.
He's getting a quality education.

230
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:40,073
I don't give a damn about his education!

231
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,565
If I'm gonna get shot at,
I want hazard pay.

232
00:14:42,643 --> 00:14:43,947
I want another 30 grand.

233
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:45,081
Calm down, man.

234
00:14:45,271 --> 00:14:48,171
And don't try to tell me
you don't have it. You hear me?

235
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:51,855
Now get the hell out of my house.

236
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:05,122
I thought I told you to go to bed.

237
00:15:33,217 --> 00:15:34,292
She's not here.

238
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:36,104
I noticed.

239
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:37,971
What are you doing?

240
00:15:38,167 --> 00:15:39,222
Looking for Juliet.

241
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:43,062
You're not gonna find her in there.
She left with Jack.

242
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,640
Juliet left with Jack?

243
00:15:44,731 --> 00:15:47,092
He took off right after
I told him about Naomi.

244
00:15:47,249 --> 00:15:48,355
Who's Naomi?

245
00:15:48,842 --> 00:15:50,431
And why would you do that, Kate?

246
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,921
Because she's hurt,
because he's a doctor

247
00:15:53,002 --> 00:15:54,863
and because he has a right to know.

248
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
Where is he now?

249
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:57,654
I don't know, Sayid.

250
00:15:58,323 --> 00:15:59,515
Of course you don't.

251
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:02,507
It might be time for you to tell
everybody else about Naomi, too.

252
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:03,669
Play her the tape.

253
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:06,533
What tape?

254
00:16:13,048 --> 00:16:15,337
There's something you should know,
before we go.

255
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,746
Whether or not you think
he's the Wizard of Oz,

256
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:23,324
I can assure you
that Jacob is very, very real.

257
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:29,787
And we're gonna go see him,
and he's not gonna like it.

258
00:16:30,854 --> 00:16:34,162
In fact, I have a feeling
he's gonna be very... angry.

259
00:16:37,732 --> 00:16:39,153
And that's why my hand was shaking,

260
00:16:39,227 --> 00:16:41,526
because this is not a man
you go and see.

261
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:44,461
This is a man who summons you.

262
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,093
Well, I guess
there's a first time for everything.

263
00:17:31,266 --> 00:17:32,367
It's us.

264
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:34,747
That's you, and that's me.

265
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,452
Now we never have to be
away from each other.

266
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,851
Happy birthday, Ben.

267
00:17:49,115 --> 00:17:50,115
Thanks.

268
00:17:50,301 --> 00:17:51,301
You're welcome.

269
00:18:38,239 --> 00:18:39,425
It's your birthday.

270
00:18:42,989 --> 00:18:44,179
Sorry I forgot.

271
00:18:48,863 --> 00:18:51,962
It's kinda hard to celebrate
on the day you killed your mom.

272
00:18:53,926 --> 00:18:56,789
She was just seven months pregnant.
We went for a hike,

273
00:18:57,929 --> 00:18:59,507
but you had to come early.

274
00:19:02,113 --> 00:19:03,564
Now she's gone...

275
00:19:05,864 --> 00:19:09,455
and I'm stuck here on this island...
with you.

276
00:19:21,549 --> 00:19:22,836
Happy birthday, Ben.

277
00:19:49,099 --> 00:19:50,134
Mom?

278
00:19:56,347 --> 00:19:57,434
Ben, don't!

279
00:20:02,173 --> 00:20:03,229
Mom!

280
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:05,165
It's not time yet, Benjamin.

281
00:20:13,538 --> 00:20:14,613
Mom!

282
00:20:54,339 --> 00:20:55,499
Let's go, John.

283
00:21:07,273 --> 00:21:09,238
So, what, the whole world
thinks we're dead?

284
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:11,415
- That's not important right now.
- Not important?

285
00:21:11,499 --> 00:21:13,056
What do you mean, it's not important?

286
00:21:13,175 --> 00:21:14,175
Excuse me.

287
00:21:15,298 --> 00:21:17,652
I'm sorry. Don't you people
want to be rescued?

288
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,902
We kept her a secret to keep her safe.

289
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,125
Safe from what, Sayid?

290
00:21:21,216 --> 00:21:22,507
Safe from Jack.

291
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,240
He spent a week with the others,

292
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,446
and he brought one of them
back with him,

293
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,836
here, amongst us,

294
00:21:30,763 --> 00:21:33,059
and every time we try
to get answers from this woman,

295
00:21:33,467 --> 00:21:34,854
he prevents her from giving them.

296
00:21:35,338 --> 00:21:36,338
But it's Jack.

297
00:21:37,402 --> 00:21:39,513
He would never do anything to hurt us.

298
00:21:40,276 --> 00:21:41,276
And Juliet...

299
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:43,320
I believe she's a good person.

300
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:44,466
Good person, huh?

301
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:46,226
You're basing that on what?

302
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:47,653
Wouldn't involve her taking you

303
00:21:47,715 --> 00:21:50,604
to one of their medical stations,
would it now, Mrs. Kwon?

304
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:54,974
<i>Kwon is pregnant.</i>

305
00:21:55,079 --> 00:21:57,776
<i>The fetus is healthy
and was conceived on island</i>

306
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,558
<i>with her husband.
He was sterile before they got here.</i>

307
00:22:01,211 --> 00:22:03,701
<i>I'm still working on getting samples
from the other women.</i>

308
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,302
<i>I should have Austen's soon.</i>

309
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,333
<i>I'll report back when I know more.</i>

310
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:08,793
Where'd you get that?

311
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:12,358
Where have you been, Jack?

312
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,763
I asked you where you got it.

313
00:22:13,852 --> 00:22:16,160
You think you're in a position
to be asking us questions?

314
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,878
- Turn the tape over.
- Stay out of it.

315
00:22:17,951 --> 00:22:19,627
You wanna burn me at a stake?
Here I am.

316
00:22:19,668 --> 00:22:22,813
But first, turn the tape over.
Press "play."

317
00:22:33,168 --> 00:22:34,559
<i>Juliet, it's Ben.</i>

318
00:22:34,879 --> 00:22:38,492
<i>I'm sending three teams to extract
Kwon the night after tomorrow.</i>

319
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:40,669
<i>We won't have time
to run Austen's sample,</i>

320
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:43,515
<i>so if you determine
that she or anyone else is pregnant,</i>

321
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:46,577
<i>mark their tents,
and we'll take them, too.</i>

322
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:49,355
<i>Good luck.</i>

323
00:22:55,853 --> 00:22:58,204
The night I saw your baby
on the ultrasound,

324
00:22:58,482 --> 00:23:00,576
I told Jack what they were making me do.

325
00:23:03,043 --> 00:23:04,320
Why didn't you tell us?

326
00:23:05,793 --> 00:23:08,252
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

327
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,730
"Yet?"

328
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,381
I think we got
some catching up to do.

329
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:35,777
Mom?

330
00:24:42,997 --> 00:24:44,063
Mom?

331
00:25:15,394 --> 00:25:17,727
I didn't mean to scare you.
Wait. Are you lost? Wait.

332
00:25:21,601 --> 00:25:22,712
Are you one of them?

333
00:25:23,976 --> 00:25:24,976
One of who?

334
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:26,677
A hostile.

335
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:31,984
Do you even know what that word means?

336
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:34,041
What's your name?

337
00:25:36,276 --> 00:25:39,732
So you wanna tell me what you're doing
in the jungle all by yourself?

338
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:44,031
I left home, and...

339
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,068
I'm looking for my mom.

340
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:47,802
You think she's out here?

341
00:25:48,725 --> 00:25:50,058
You wouldn't believe me.

342
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,033
Try me.

343
00:25:54,795 --> 00:25:55,918
She's dead.

344
00:26:01,692 --> 00:26:02,847
Did she die here?

345
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,228
On the island?

346
00:26:06,726 --> 00:26:07,726
When I was a baby.

347
00:26:09,266 --> 00:26:10,351
Did you see her?

348
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:12,528
Out here, Ben, in the jungle?

349
00:26:15,165 --> 00:26:16,165
She talked to me.

350
00:26:19,392 --> 00:26:20,477
What did she say?

351
00:26:20,666 --> 00:26:22,332
That I couldn't come with her.

352
00:26:23,913 --> 00:26:25,468
She said it wasn't time yet.

353
00:26:33,813 --> 00:26:36,289
You should go home now.
Your people will be looking for you.

354
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:37,845
I don't wanna go back there!

355
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,715
I hate it there!

356
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:47,705
Take me with you.

357
00:26:50,267 --> 00:26:51,600
Maybe that can happen...

358
00:26:52,515 --> 00:26:53,680
Maybe,

359
00:26:54,682 --> 00:26:57,223
if that's what you really want,
if that's what you want.

360
00:26:57,265 --> 00:26:58,704
I want you to think about that.

361
00:27:01,265 --> 00:27:04,880
And you're gonna have to be very,
very patient.

362
00:27:27,348 --> 00:27:28,454
We're here.

363
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,184
You'll want to turn off your flashlight.

364
00:27:44,328 --> 00:27:45,328
Why?

365
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,506
Jacob feels the same way
about technology as you do.

366
00:28:29,387 --> 00:28:31,973
Once I open this door,
there's no turning back.

367
00:28:35,484 --> 00:28:37,355
Are you sure this is what you want?

368
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:46,956
So be it.

369
00:28:53,078 --> 00:28:54,466
I'm here with John Locke.

370
00:28:55,765 --> 00:28:56,876
We're coming in now.

371
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,764
Jacob.

372
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:25,139
This is John.

373
00:29:28,202 --> 00:29:29,955
Aren't you going to say hello, John?

374
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:33,705
What?

375
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:36,358
I told you he wouldn't.

376
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:39,508
Who... What are you talking about?

377
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:42,267
You can't see him?

378
00:29:44,018 --> 00:29:45,018
See who?

379
00:29:47,518 --> 00:29:48,529
He's sitting right here.

380
00:29:49,281 --> 00:29:50,292
In this chair.

381
00:29:50,787 --> 00:29:52,565
Yes, I know! But he insisted.

382
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:56,291
What is this?

383
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,385
You wanted the secrets of the island?

384
00:29:59,517 --> 00:30:00,628
Well, here they are.

385
00:30:01,893 --> 00:30:04,309
This is the man
who can answer every single...

386
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:06,832
I am not.

387
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:10,979
He made me bring him here.
Did you think that that was my...

388
00:30:11,082 --> 00:30:12,409
Sorry, may I finish?

389
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:13,518
You're crazy.

390
00:30:16,018 --> 00:30:17,018
Excuse me?

391
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:20,613
You don't know anything
about the island, do you?

392
00:30:20,707 --> 00:30:22,754
You just made it all up.

393
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:24,165
Jacob, please, I can't hear him

394
00:30:24,186 --> 00:30:26,017
if you're gonna talk
over what he's saying...

395
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:27,018
Shut up!

396
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:31,169
You're putting on a show for me?

397
00:30:33,018 --> 00:30:34,018
Or do you...

398
00:30:36,643 --> 00:30:38,405
Do you really think
there's someone there?

399
00:30:39,579 --> 00:30:41,134
I know there's someone there.

400
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:47,788
You don't know anything.

401
00:30:57,074 --> 00:30:58,872
I'm sorry you feel that way, John,

402
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,929
And I'm sorry
that you're too limited to see.

403
00:31:05,895 --> 00:31:06,895
You're pathetic.

404
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,459
Help me.

405
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,491
What did you just say?

406
00:31:24,936 --> 00:31:25,943
I...

407
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,437
I didn't say anything.

408
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:29,394
Oh, yes, you did.

409
00:31:29,896 --> 00:31:30,896
I heard you.

410
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:32,885
You said...

411
00:31:52,931 --> 00:31:54,949
That's enough! You've had your fun!

412
00:32:45,267 --> 00:32:46,267
What was that?

413
00:32:51,890 --> 00:32:53,017
That was Jacob.

414
00:33:00,838 --> 00:33:02,277
What did you hear in there, John?

415
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:05,645
What did Jacob say to you?

416
00:33:07,826 --> 00:33:09,562
He didn't say anything to me.

417
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:10,764
You did.

418
00:33:12,138 --> 00:33:14,782
- What are you talking about?
- There is no Jacob, Ben.

419
00:33:15,388 --> 00:33:17,368
I'm not gonna be taken in
by the little...

420
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:19,549
show you put on last night.

421
00:33:19,764 --> 00:33:22,501
You're a fraud,
and it's time your people

422
00:33:22,699 --> 00:33:23,810
were told the truth.

423
00:33:25,637 --> 00:33:27,414
And this is not the way we came.

424
00:33:29,386 --> 00:33:31,108
I'm taking us back another way.

425
00:33:31,338 --> 00:33:33,230
I wanted to show you something first.

426
00:33:33,949 --> 00:33:34,949
I've seen enough.

427
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,378
You know, John, you're not wrong.

428
00:33:38,512 --> 00:33:40,159
Some of the things I've told you...

429
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,472
Some of the things
I've told everybody...

430
00:33:42,699 --> 00:33:43,810
are simply not true.

431
00:33:44,577 --> 00:33:45,577
Like what?

432
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:49,265
Well, for starters,
I wasn't born on this island.

433
00:33:51,138 --> 00:33:52,749
Then where did you come from?

434
00:33:55,761 --> 00:33:57,483
That's what I want to show you.

435
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:50,014
Morning.

436
00:34:50,227 --> 00:34:52,359
Okay, wait. Put it right...

437
00:34:52,459 --> 00:34:53,513
Right down there.

438
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,166
What's the problem now?

439
00:34:59,005 --> 00:35:01,316
You're usually chatty cathy
in the morning.

440
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:03,023
It's my birthday.

441
00:35:07,194 --> 00:35:09,322
I don't know why I keep fooling myself
into thinking

442
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,279
that one of these years
you're actually gonna remember.

443
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,040
Well, I tell you what.

444
00:35:17,763 --> 00:35:19,318
All we gotta do this morning

445
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,866
is run this stuff out to Pearl station.

446
00:35:23,448 --> 00:35:25,170
Why don't we go up to the Mesa,

447
00:35:25,625 --> 00:35:26,700
drink some beers?

448
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,140
Have some...

449
00:35:32,577 --> 00:35:34,624
I don't know... Father and son time?

450
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:39,637
I'd like that.

451
00:36:00,013 --> 00:36:02,124
You sure can't say it ain't beautiful.

452
00:36:15,483 --> 00:36:16,916
Do you really blame me?

453
00:36:17,893 --> 00:36:18,893
What?

454
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:23,120
Do you really think it's my fault
that she died?

455
00:36:28,015 --> 00:36:29,015
What do I know?

456
00:36:34,547 --> 00:36:36,470
Why do you keep looking
at your watch?

457
00:36:37,024 --> 00:36:38,203
You got a date?

458
00:36:39,566 --> 00:36:40,573
Listen...

459
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,480
If it makes you feel any better,

460
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:49,708
I will do my best
to remember your birthday next year.

461
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:56,120
I don't think that's gonna happen, dad.

462
00:36:58,701 --> 00:36:59,701
What do you mean?

463
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,129
You know, I've missed her, too.

464
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,334
Maybe as much as you have.

465
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,614
But the difference is

466
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:11,359
that for as long as I can remember,
I've had to put up with you.

467
00:37:13,952 --> 00:37:18,648
And doing that required
a tremendous amount of patience.

468
00:37:26,254 --> 00:37:27,454
Good-bye, dad.

469
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:52,609
You want us to...

470
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:54,198
go get his body?

471
00:39:58,557 --> 00:40:00,000
No, leave him out there.

472
00:40:23,648 --> 00:40:25,373
This is where I came from, John.

473
00:40:29,256 --> 00:40:30,656
These are my people...

474
00:40:32,318 --> 00:40:33,822
the Dharma Initiative.

475
00:40:36,669 --> 00:40:38,603
They came here seeking harmony...

476
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:45,259
but they couldn't even coexist
with the island's original inhabitants.

477
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:51,843
And when it became clear
that one side had to go,

478
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,550
one side had to be purged...

479
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,989
I did what I had to do.

480
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:03,112
I was one of the people
that was smart enough

481
00:41:03,175 --> 00:41:05,578
to make sure that I didn't end up
in that ditch...

482
00:41:06,787 --> 00:41:09,254
Which makes me considerably smarter
than you, John.

483
00:41:24,473 --> 00:41:25,895
What did Jacob say to you?

484
00:41:26,828 --> 00:41:28,019
Why did you do this?

485
00:41:28,701 --> 00:41:30,173
Because you heard him.

486
00:41:32,837 --> 00:41:34,667
Now I need to know what he said.

487
00:41:35,817 --> 00:41:36,836
"Help me."

488
00:41:39,569 --> 00:41:41,095
I'm not gonna ask you again.

489
00:41:42,264 --> 00:41:43,666
What did he say to you?

490
00:41:46,191 --> 00:41:47,191
He said...

491
00:41:49,003 --> 00:41:50,003
"Help me."

492
00:42:01,336 --> 00:42:03,688
Well, I certainly hope he helps you,
John.
