00:00:00,108 --> 00:00:01,753
<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,033 --> 00:00:03,512
I don't know how it happenned,

3
00:00:03,848 --> 00:00:07,223
but you seem to have
some communion with this island, John.

4
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:10,437
And that makes you very, very important.

5
00:00:10,647 --> 00:00:13,370
In time, you'll have
a better understanding of things.

6
00:00:16,391 --> 00:00:17,513
Kwon is pregnant.

7
00:00:17,771 --> 00:00:19,048
<i>The fetus is healthy...</i>

8
00:00:19,688 --> 00:00:20,722
What's that?

9
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:23,419
Juliet is gathering information for us
at your former camp.

10
00:00:23,521 --> 00:00:25,732
She's determining if any of the women
are pregnant.

11
00:00:25,896 --> 00:00:29,129
Then we're gonna go in and... take them.

12
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:31,083
Juliet is a mole.

13
00:00:31,674 --> 00:00:32,933
She's working for Ben.

14
00:00:35,196 --> 00:00:36,334
We're moving.

15
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:39,680
- Moving? Where are we going?
- We are not going anywhere, John.

16
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:41,819
You are going to stay behind.

17
00:00:42,019 --> 00:00:43,774
We'll leave a trail...
One you can track.

18
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,242
And, John,

19
00:00:45,535 --> 00:00:48,224
unless you're carrying
your father's body on your back...

20
00:00:49,646 --> 00:00:50,712
don't bother.

21
00:00:56,755 --> 00:00:58,511
Come on! Damn it, push!

22
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:03,546
Something's wrong.

23
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:04,828
I can't...

24
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:08,606
Emily...

25
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:10,027
you can do this!

26
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:11,224
Now push!

27
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:13,137
Come on. Come on, baby.

28
00:01:13,285 --> 00:01:14,785
You can do it. Now come on!

29
00:01:14,913 --> 00:01:17,341
Come on. There you go! Come on!

30
00:01:23,994 --> 00:01:25,154
It's a boy.

31
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:27,474
You did it.

32
00:01:29,522 --> 00:01:30,597
It hurts.

33
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,497
Oh, you did it.

34
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,035
Roger, it hurts.

35
00:01:50,224 --> 00:01:52,983
Emily, no one knows we're out here.

36
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:54,972
We gotta get back, okay, honey?

37
00:01:55,112 --> 00:01:56,733
Can you hold on to the baby?

38
00:01:58,249 --> 00:01:59,660
Can you hold the baby?

39
00:01:59,972 --> 00:02:00,972
Hold him tight.

40
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:17,158
Help! Help!

41
00:02:17,502 --> 00:02:18,746
Help!

42
00:02:20,094 --> 00:02:21,276
Help!

43
00:02:23,171 --> 00:02:25,082
Come on. Help me.

44
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:27,759
Hey, what happened, man?

45
00:02:28,886 --> 00:02:30,045
We were hiking.

46
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:33,291
She went into labor,
and she wasn't due yet. She's bleeding.

47
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,467
Okay, look.
We'll put her in the car, okay?

48
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,317
We're gonna get you to the hospital.

49
00:02:37,421 --> 00:02:39,182
Oh, okay. Okay, honey.

50
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:41,598
- Okay, it's all right.
- Let's keep her warm. All right?

51
00:02:42,058 --> 00:02:44,368
- How's the baby?
- Fine, I guess. I don't know.

52
00:02:45,625 --> 00:02:46,794
Roger...

53
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:49,044
I'm right here.

54
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:50,406
Call him Benjamin...

55
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:52,361
Stay with me.

56
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,971
Stay with me!

57
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,137
God, no!

58
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:13,539
What you got there?

59
00:03:14,173 --> 00:03:15,506
It's a birthday present.

60
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:17,899
Mine just happens to be today.

61
00:03:19,857 --> 00:03:22,301
You do remember birthdays,
don't you, Richard?

62
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,359
So do you want me
to bring the tape back to Juliet?

63
00:03:27,523 --> 00:03:28,626
- What?
- The tape

64
00:03:28,678 --> 00:03:30,152
with your instructions for Juliet...

65
00:03:30,183 --> 00:03:32,410
Do you want me to bring it back
to the medical station?

66
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,427
I recorded it yesterday before we left.

67
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:35,779
I thought you already took it!

68
00:03:37,754 --> 00:03:38,860
Where's Tom?

69
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,622
Have you seen my recorder?

70
00:04:08,646 --> 00:04:11,427
You said that if I... killed my father,

71
00:04:12,814 --> 00:04:15,346
you'd tell me everything
I wanted to know about the island.

72
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:22,861
So why don't you start at the beginning?

73
00:04:36,835 --> 00:04:40,368
Subtitles: swsub.com

74
00:04:43,887 --> 00:04:45,793
I know I promised
to tell you everything,

75
00:04:46,248 --> 00:04:47,706
and I wish it was as simple

76
00:04:47,768 --> 00:04:50,383
as me taking out a dusty old book
and opening it up.

77
00:05:02,450 --> 00:05:03,838
But it's not that simple.

78
00:05:04,765 --> 00:05:06,265
How about you just tell me?

79
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:10,371
You probably think
I'm the leader of this little community,

80
00:05:11,115 --> 00:05:12,536
but that's not entirely true.

81
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:16,608
We all answer to someone, John.

82
00:05:16,863 --> 00:05:18,128
And who might that be?

83
00:05:20,638 --> 00:05:21,891
His name is Jacob.

84
00:05:23,579 --> 00:05:24,579
Okay, then.

85
00:05:24,763 --> 00:05:25,763
Take me to Jacob.

86
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,950
I can't do that.

87
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:30,907
Where are you going?

88
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,218
If you don't want to take me,
maybe someone else will.

89
00:05:33,388 --> 00:05:35,102
I'll just go and ask Richard.

90
00:05:35,203 --> 00:05:36,548
Why would Richard take you?

91
00:05:36,634 --> 00:05:38,949
He doesn't know where Jacob is.
He doesn't talk to Jacob.

92
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,296
- Well, who talks to him?
- I do.

93
00:05:40,307 --> 00:05:42,514
- You're the only one who talks to him?
- That's right.

94
00:05:42,515 --> 00:05:44,525
And no one else knows where he is?

95
00:05:45,139 --> 00:05:47,098
I was born here on this island.

96
00:05:47,763 --> 00:05:49,613
I'm one of the last that was.

97
00:05:49,826 --> 00:05:51,140
Most of these people you see...

98
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:54,425
I brought them here,
so Jacob talks to me, John.

99
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:57,747
He tells me what to do, trusts me.

100
00:05:58,327 --> 00:06:02,177
And no one else has ever seen him?

101
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:03,704
That's right.

102
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:05,453
How convenient.

103
00:06:06,304 --> 00:06:07,890
You know what I think, Ben?

104
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,894
I think there is no Jacob.

105
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,389
I think your people are idiots

106
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:15,167
if they believe you take orders
from someone else.

107
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:17,964
You are the man behind the curtain...

108
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:20,756
the Wizard of Oz...

109
00:06:23,203 --> 00:06:24,257
and you're a liar.

110
00:06:26,701 --> 00:06:28,944
And what might you base
that theory on, John?

111
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:31,188
Because if you were telling the truth,

112
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,991
your hand wouldn't be shaking.

113
00:07:11,763 --> 00:07:12,827
Namaste.

114
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,360
Thanks.

115
00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:19,718
Hey, welcome to the island, man.

116
00:07:22,014 --> 00:07:23,956
So what do you think?

117
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,118
Wow, this is some place.

118
00:07:27,394 --> 00:07:29,463
Thanks again for the opportunity,
Mr. Goodspeed.

119
00:07:29,512 --> 00:07:30,512
Horace, please.

120
00:07:31,378 --> 00:07:32,620
And this must be Ben.

121
00:07:32,764 --> 00:07:35,652
Yeah. Mr. Goodspeed was there
the day you were born.

122
00:07:36,075 --> 00:07:37,075
Yes, I was.

123
00:07:38,162 --> 00:07:39,730
He's doing us a big favor here.

124
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:41,577
He gave your old man a job.

125
00:07:43,074 --> 00:07:45,327
- Uh, he don't say much.
- That's okay.

126
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:48,400
I bet he will when he has
something to say, right, Ben?

127
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:50,902
Hey, you hungry, kiddo?

128
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:55,458
Great. All right, well, I tell you what.

129
00:07:55,530 --> 00:07:58,592
After you're done processing,
we'll have some lunch. How's that sound?

130
00:07:58,716 --> 00:07:59,716
Thank you.

131
00:07:59,903 --> 00:08:01,347
You're gonna love it here.

132
00:08:03,055 --> 00:08:04,377
<i>Welcome to the island.</i>

133
00:08:04,745 --> 00:08:06,333
<i>For your own comfort and safety,</i>

134
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:09,516
<i>we ask that you stay within the
confines of your new living quarters.</i>

135
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:12,765
<i>Our barracks are surrounded
by a high-frequency sonar fence</i>

136
00:08:14,157 --> 00:08:18,077
<i>to protect us from the island's
abundant and diverse wildlife.</i>

137
00:08:18,779 --> 00:08:21,334
<i>You are now a member
of the Dharma Initiative.</i>

138
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,254
What kind of wildlife you think
this fence is protecting us from?

139
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:25,343
Roger Linus?

140
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,968
<i>Every morning you will be given
a new code</i>

141
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:32,366
<i>which will allow you
to cross outside the fences</i>

142
00:08:32,507 --> 00:08:33,741
<i>if you so desire.</i>

143
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:37,563
<i>There are properties on this island
that exist nowhere else on earth.</i>

144
00:08:38,127 --> 00:08:40,500
<i>Our mission is to study these properties</i>

145
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:44,512
<i>for the betterment of mankind
and advancement of world peace.</i>

146
00:08:44,932 --> 00:08:47,206
<i>Most of you
will be working on the mainland.</i>

147
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,986
<i>Should you be assigned
geological study...</i>

148
00:08:50,765 --> 00:08:51,952
Hey.

149
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:54,098
You're new, huh?

150
00:08:56,342 --> 00:08:57,342
I'm Annie.

151
00:08:59,403 --> 00:09:00,403
Want one?

152
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:06,064
We can have as many as we want.

153
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:08,407
"Work man"?

154
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:11,522
What is this? Workman?

155
00:09:13,786 --> 00:09:14,903
I'm a janitor?

156
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,282
I'm sorry, Mr. Linus.

157
00:09:16,454 --> 00:09:18,718
Goodspeed told me
you people were doing experiments,

158
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:19,774
changing the world.

159
00:09:19,966 --> 00:09:21,729
I didn't come here
to clean up after you.

160
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,103
Look, if anything else opens up,

161
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:24,725
you can feel free to apply for it.

162
00:09:28,332 --> 00:09:29,407
Come on.

163
00:09:47,388 --> 00:09:49,327
- What happened to you?
- I was with Locke.

164
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:51,637
Where is he?

165
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,890
He went back.

166
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:54,327
Back where?

167
00:09:54,452 --> 00:09:56,515
With them.
Don't ask me where the hell it is,

168
00:09:56,585 --> 00:09:58,349
'cause it don't matter right now.

169
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:01,340
What does matter... is this.

170
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,180
Where is Ben?!

171
00:10:13,741 --> 00:10:14,826
Where is he?!

172
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:21,597
I thought you were dead.

173
00:10:23,427 --> 00:10:26,239
I'm fortunate the pylons
were not set to a lethal level.

174
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,750
What is he doing here?

175
00:10:32,892 --> 00:10:35,421
- It's all right.
- He's the one who tried to kill me!

176
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:39,138
He's with us now.

177
00:10:41,263 --> 00:10:42,472
Where have you been, Mikhail?

178
00:10:42,577 --> 00:10:45,106
I encountered several of his people
in the jungle.

179
00:10:45,828 --> 00:10:47,828
They had an injured woman with them.

180
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:50,465
Apparently,
she had just parachuted onto the island.

181
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:52,932
- What?
- Her helo crashed in the water.

182
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:58,244
She says her ship is approximately
130 clicks to the west of us.

183
00:10:58,702 --> 00:11:01,014
- She has a radio-telephone.
- Where is she now?

184
00:11:01,514 --> 00:11:03,934
I assume they have taken her
back to their camp.

185
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:06,761
We'll be visiting their camp
day after tomorrow.

186
00:11:06,762 --> 00:11:08,939
- We'll take care of it then.
- Day after tomorrow?

187
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,201
We have to go now.

188
00:11:10,329 --> 00:11:12,276
Ben's not going anywhere with you.

189
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:15,999
- Excuse me?
- He and I are going to see Jacob.

190
00:11:23,802 --> 00:11:25,662
Please tell me
this isn't true, Benjamin.

191
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:34,246
Sorry. I have to deal
with this now, John.

192
00:11:34,388 --> 00:11:36,165
Our excursion will have to wait.

193
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:39,970
Since when
do you explain yourself to him...

194
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:41,385
an outsider?

195
00:12:00,756 --> 00:12:01,939
So when do we leave?

196
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,351
You know, you didn't have to beat him
senseless to make your point.

197
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,865
Yes, I did.

198
00:12:18,787 --> 00:12:20,707
I hear you're gonna go see Jacob.

199
00:12:21,997 --> 00:12:23,274
You're gonna need this.

200
00:12:31,248 --> 00:12:32,248
Thanks.

201
00:12:39,435 --> 00:12:40,546
Happy birthday, dad.

202
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:58,076
So once water
is added to the bicarbonate,

203
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:01,019
we will get
our very own volcanic reaction.

204
00:13:02,735 --> 00:13:03,747
Yes?

205
00:13:03,806 --> 00:13:06,084
Is that what happened
to the volcano on this island?

206
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,745
Exactly, Annie,
but that was a long time ago.

207
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:12,421
Okay, let's get ourselves an eruption.

208
00:13:14,247 --> 00:13:16,485
Just add water, and voilà.

209
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:18,587
Now I know it's not lava, but...

210
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,784
What was that?!

211
00:13:26,435 --> 00:13:28,512
Okay, everyone, into your positions.

212
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:31,398
Get over here!

213
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:33,324
That's right, all together!

214
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:35,762
Annie, lock the back door, please.

215
00:13:38,764 --> 00:13:40,854
Ben, come on, honey, you gotta move.

216
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:48,533
Come on!

217
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:56,851
Don't worry. It's just the hostiles.

218
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:00,011
We'll be okay.

219
00:14:06,544 --> 00:14:08,579
Hey, man, I heard
you ran into a little trouble.

220
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:12,231
We were driving back from the plane,
and we hear this huge explosion.

221
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:15,316
Next thing I know,
there's a siren wailing,

222
00:14:15,404 --> 00:14:17,482
and we're driving through
the middle of a shootout.

223
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:19,787
Look, we're having some skirmishes
with the natives.

224
00:14:20,064 --> 00:14:21,507
What do you mean, natives?

225
00:14:21,662 --> 00:14:23,794
We're not exactly sure who they are.

226
00:14:24,108 --> 00:14:26,219
This ain't what I signed up for.

227
00:14:26,482 --> 00:14:28,486
Roger, I did you a favor, man.

228
00:14:28,728 --> 00:14:30,337
You were having trouble finding work,

229
00:14:30,418 --> 00:14:33,411
and don't forget about Ben.
He's getting a quality education.

230
00:14:33,466 --> 00:14:35,473
I don't give a damn about his education!

231
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,965
If I'm gonna get shot at,
I want hazard pay.

232
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,347
I want another 30 grand.

233
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:40,481
Calm down, man.

234
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:43,571
And don't try to tell me
you don't have it. You hear me?

235
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:47,255
Now get the hell out of my house.

236
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,522
I thought I told you to go to bed.

237
00:15:28,617 --> 00:15:29,692
She's not here.

238
00:15:30,504 --> 00:15:31,504
I noticed.

239
00:15:32,316 --> 00:15:33,371
What are you doing?

240
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:34,622
Looking for Juliet.

241
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,462
You're not gonna find her in there.
She left with Jack.

242
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:40,040
Juliet left with Jack?

243
00:15:40,131 --> 00:15:42,492
He took off right after
I told him about Naomi.

244
00:15:42,649 --> 00:15:43,755
Who's Naomi?

245
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:45,831
And why would you do that, Kate?

246
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:48,321
Because she's hurt,
because he's a doctor

247
00:15:48,402 --> 00:15:50,263
and because he has a right to know.

248
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
Where is he now?

249
00:15:51,943 --> 00:15:53,054
I don't know, Sayid.

250
00:15:53,723 --> 00:15:54,915
Of course you don't.

251
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:57,907
It might be time for you to tell
everybody else about Naomi, too.

252
00:15:58,069 --> 00:15:59,069
Play her the tape.

253
00:16:00,846 --> 00:16:01,933
What tape?

254
00:16:08,448 --> 00:16:10,737
There's something you should know,
before we go.

255
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:15,146
Whether or not you think
he's the Wizard of Oz,

256
00:16:15,757 --> 00:16:18,724
I can assure you
that Jacob is very, very real.

257
00:16:22,444 --> 00:16:25,187
And we're gonna go see him,
and he's not gonna like it.

258
00:16:26,254 --> 00:16:29,562
In fact, I have a feeling
he's gonna be very... angry.

259
00:16:33,132 --> 00:16:34,553
And that's why my hand was shaking,

260
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:36,926
because this is not a man
you go and see.

261
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,861
This is a man who summons you.

262
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:45,493
Well, I guess
there's a first time for everything.

263
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:26,367
It's us.

264
00:17:27,303 --> 00:17:28,747
That's you, and that's me.

265
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:34,452
Now we never have to be
away from each other.

266
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,851
Happy birthday, Ben.

267
00:17:43,115 --> 00:17:44,115
Thanks.

268
00:17:44,301 --> 00:17:45,301
You're welcome.

269
00:18:32,239 --> 00:18:33,425
It's your birthday.

270
00:18:36,989 --> 00:18:38,179
Sorry I forgot.

271
00:18:42,863 --> 00:18:45,962
It's kinda hard to celebrate
on the day you killed your mom.

272
00:18:47,926 --> 00:18:50,789
She was just seven months pregnant.
We went for a hike,

273
00:18:51,929 --> 00:18:53,507
but you had to come early.

274
00:18:56,113 --> 00:18:57,564
Now she's gone...

275
00:18:59,864 --> 00:19:03,455
and I'm stuck here on this island...
with you.

276
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:16,836
Happy birthday, Ben.

277
00:19:43,099 --> 00:19:44,134
Mom?

278
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:51,434
Ben, don't!

279
00:19:56,173 --> 00:19:57,229
Mom!

280
00:19:57,610 --> 00:19:59,165
It's not time yet, Benjamin.

281
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:08,613
Mom!

282
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:49,499
Let's go, John.

283
00:21:01,273 --> 00:21:03,238
So, what, the whole world
thinks we're dead?

284
00:21:03,361 --> 00:21:05,415
- That's not important right now.
- Not important?

285
00:21:05,499 --> 00:21:07,056
What do you mean, it's not important?

286
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:08,175
Excuse me.

287
00:21:09,298 --> 00:21:11,652
I'm sorry. Don't you people
want to be rescued?

288
00:21:12,152 --> 00:21:13,902
We kept her a secret to keep her safe.

289
00:21:13,903 --> 00:21:15,125
Safe from what, Sayid?

290
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:16,507
Safe from Jack.

291
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,240
He spent a week with the others,

292
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:21,446
and he brought one of them
back with him,

293
00:21:21,839 --> 00:21:23,836
here, amongst us,

294
00:21:24,763 --> 00:21:27,059
and every time we try
to get answers from this woman,

295
00:21:27,467 --> 00:21:28,854
he prevents her from giving them.

296
00:21:29,338 --> 00:21:30,338
But it's Jack.

297
00:21:31,402 --> 00:21:33,513
He would never do anything to hurt us.

298
00:21:34,276 --> 00:21:35,276
And Juliet...

299
00:21:35,838 --> 00:21:37,320
I believe she's a good person.

300
00:21:37,466 --> 00:21:38,466
Good person, huh?

301
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:40,226
You're basing that on what?

302
00:21:40,377 --> 00:21:41,653
Wouldn't involve her taking you

303
00:21:41,715 --> 00:21:44,604
to one of their medical stations,
would it now, Mrs. Kwon?

304
00:21:47,866 --> 00:21:48,974
<i>Kwon is pregnant.</i>

305
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,776
<i>The fetus is healthy
and was conceived on island</i>

306
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,558
<i>with her husband.
He was sterile before they got here.</i>

307
00:21:55,211 --> 00:21:57,701
<i>I'm still working on getting samples
from the other women.</i>

308
00:21:57,776 --> 00:21:59,302
<i>I should have Austen's soon.</i>

309
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,333
<i>I'll report back when I know more.</i>

310
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:02,793
Where'd you get that?

311
00:22:05,065 --> 00:22:06,358
Where have you been, Jack?

312
00:22:06,414 --> 00:22:07,763
I asked you where you got it.

313
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:10,160
You think you're in a position
to be asking us questions?

314
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,878
- Turn the tape over.
- Stay out of it.

315
00:22:11,951 --> 00:22:13,627
You wanna burn me at a stake?
Here I am.

316
00:22:13,668 --> 00:22:16,813
But first, turn the tape over.
Press "play."

317
00:22:27,168 --> 00:22:28,559
<i>Juliet, it's Ben.</i>

318
00:22:28,879 --> 00:22:32,492
<i>I'm sending three teams to extract
Kwon the night after tomorrow.</i>

319
00:22:32,573 --> 00:22:34,669
<i>We won't have time
to run Austen's sample,</i>

320
00:22:34,792 --> 00:22:37,515
<i>so if you determine
that she or anyone else is pregnant,</i>

321
00:22:37,681 --> 00:22:40,577
<i>mark their tents,
and we'll take them, too.</i>

322
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:43,355
<i>Good luck.</i>

323
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:52,204
The night I saw your baby
on the ultrasound,

324
00:22:52,482 --> 00:22:54,576
I told Jack what they were making me do.

325
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:58,320
Why didn't you tell us?

326
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:02,252
Because I hadn't decided
what to do about it yet.

327
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,730
"Yet?"

328
00:23:11,395 --> 00:23:13,381
I think we got
some catching up to do.

329
00:24:28,332 --> 00:24:29,377
Mom?

330
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:37,663
Mom?

331
00:25:08,994 --> 00:25:11,327
I didn't mean to scare you.
Wait. Are you lost? Wait.

332
00:25:15,201 --> 00:25:16,312
Are you one of them?

333
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:18,576
One of who?

334
00:25:19,137 --> 00:25:20,277
A hostile.

335
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,584
Do you even know what that word means?

336
00:25:26,641 --> 00:25:27,641
What's your name?

337
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:33,332
So you wanna tell me what you're doing
in the jungle all by yourself?

338
00:25:35,666 --> 00:25:37,631
I left home, and...

339
00:25:38,391 --> 00:25:39,668
I'm looking for my mom.

340
00:25:40,014 --> 00:25:41,402
You think she's out here?

341
00:25:42,325 --> 00:25:43,658
You wouldn't believe me.

342
00:25:44,582 --> 00:25:45,633
Try me.

343
00:25:48,395 --> 00:25:49,518
She's dead.

344
00:25:55,292 --> 00:25:56,447
Did she die here?

345
00:25:56,828 --> 00:25:57,828
On the island?

346
00:26:00,326 --> 00:26:01,326
When I was a baby.

347
00:26:02,866 --> 00:26:03,951
Did you see her?

348
00:26:04,517 --> 00:26:06,128
Out here, Ben, in the jungle?

349
00:26:08,765 --> 00:26:09,765
She talked to me.

350
00:26:12,992 --> 00:26:14,077
What did she say?

351
00:26:14,266 --> 00:26:15,932
That I couldn't come with her.

352
00:26:17,513 --> 00:26:19,068
She said it wasn't time yet.

353
00:26:27,413 --> 00:26:29,889
You should go home now.
Your people will be looking for you.

354
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:31,445
I don't wanna go back there!

355
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,315
I hate it there!

356
00:26:40,305 --> 00:26:41,305
Take me with you.

357
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:45,200
Maybe that can happen...

358
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:47,280
Maybe,

359
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:50,823
if that's what you really want,
if that's what you want.

360
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:52,304
I want you to think about that.

361
00:26:54,865 --> 00:26:58,480
And you're gonna have to be very,
very patient.

362
00:27:20,948 --> 00:27:22,054
We're here.

363
00:27:35,927 --> 00:27:37,784
You'll want to turn off your flashlight.

364
00:27:37,928 --> 00:27:38,928
Why?

365
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,106
Jacob feels the same way
about technology as you do.

366
00:28:22,987 --> 00:28:25,573
Once I open this door,
there's no turning back.

367
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,955
Are you sure this is what you want?

368
00:28:39,556 --> 00:28:40,556
So be it.

369
00:28:46,678 --> 00:28:48,066
I'm here with John Locke.

370
00:28:49,365 --> 00:28:50,476
We're coming in now.

371
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,364
Jacob.

372
00:29:17,739 --> 00:29:18,739
This is John.

373
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,555
Aren't you going to say hello, John?

374
00:29:26,305 --> 00:29:27,305
What?

375
00:29:28,681 --> 00:29:29,958
I told you he wouldn't.

376
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:33,108
Who... What are you talking about?

377
00:29:34,729 --> 00:29:35,867
You can't see him?

378
00:29:37,618 --> 00:29:38,618
See who?

379
00:29:41,118 --> 00:29:42,129
He's sitting right here.

380
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,892
In this chair.

381
00:29:44,387 --> 00:29:46,165
Yes, I know! But he insisted.

382
00:29:48,856 --> 00:29:49,891
What is this?

383
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,985
You wanted the secrets of the island?

384
00:29:53,117 --> 00:29:54,228
Well, here they are.

385
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,909
This is the man
who can answer every single...

386
00:29:59,432 --> 00:30:00,432
I am not.

387
00:30:01,805 --> 00:30:04,579
He made me bring him here.
Did you think that that was my...

388
00:30:04,682 --> 00:30:06,009
Sorry, may I finish?

389
00:30:06,118 --> 00:30:07,118
You're crazy.

390
00:30:09,618 --> 00:30:10,618
Excuse me?

391
00:30:12,184 --> 00:30:14,213
You don't know anything
about the island, do you?

392
00:30:14,307 --> 00:30:16,354
You just made it all up.

393
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:17,765
Jacob, please, I can't hear him

394
00:30:17,786 --> 00:30:19,617
if you're gonna talk
over what he's saying...

395
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:20,618
Shut up!

396
00:30:22,992 --> 00:30:24,769
You're putting on a show for me?

397
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:27,618
Or do you...

398
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:32,005
Do you really think
there's someone there?

399
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,734
I know there's someone there.

400
00:30:40,055 --> 00:30:41,388
You don't know anything.

401
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:52,472
I'm sorry you feel that way, John,

402
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,529
And I'm sorry
that you're too limited to see.

403
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:00,495
You're pathetic.

404
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,059
Help me.

405
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,091
What did you just say?

406
00:31:18,536 --> 00:31:19,543
I...

407
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:21,037
I didn't say anything.

408
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:22,994
Oh, yes, you did.

409
00:31:23,496 --> 00:31:24,496
I heard you.

410
00:31:25,282 --> 00:31:26,485
You said...

411
00:31:46,531 --> 00:31:48,549
That's enough! You've had your fun!

412
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:39,867
What was that?

413
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:46,617
That was Jacob.

414
00:32:53,338 --> 00:32:54,777
What did you hear in there, John?

415
00:32:56,701 --> 00:32:58,145
What did Jacob say to you?

416
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:02,062
He didn't say anything to me.

417
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:03,264
You did.

418
00:33:04,638 --> 00:33:07,282
- What are you talking about?
- There is no Jacob, Ben.

419
00:33:07,888 --> 00:33:09,868
I'm not gonna be taken in
by the little...

420
00:33:10,381 --> 00:33:12,049
show you put on last night.

421
00:33:12,264 --> 00:33:15,001
You're a fraud,
and it's time your people

422
00:33:15,199 --> 00:33:16,310
were told the truth.

423
00:33:18,137 --> 00:33:19,914
And this is not the way we came.

424
00:33:21,886 --> 00:33:23,608
I'm taking us back another way.

425
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:25,730
I wanted to show you something first.

426
00:33:26,449 --> 00:33:27,449
I've seen enough.

427
00:33:29,198 --> 00:33:30,878
You know, John, you're not wrong.

428
00:33:31,012 --> 00:33:32,659
Some of the things I've told you...

429
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:34,972
Some of the things
I've told everybody...

430
00:33:35,199 --> 00:33:36,310
are simply not true.

431
00:33:37,077 --> 00:33:38,077
Like what?

432
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:41,765
Well, for starters,
I wasn't born on this island.

433
00:33:43,638 --> 00:33:45,249
Then where did you come from?

434
00:33:48,261 --> 00:33:49,983
That's what I want to show you.

435
00:34:41,387 --> 00:34:42,514
Morning.

436
00:34:42,727 --> 00:34:44,859
Okay, wait. Put it right...

437
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:46,013
Right down there.

438
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,666
What's the problem now?

439
00:34:51,505 --> 00:34:53,816
You're usually chatty cathy
in the morning.

440
00:34:54,457 --> 00:34:55,523
It's my birthday.

441
00:34:59,694 --> 00:35:01,822
I don't know why I keep fooling myself
into thinking

442
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,779
that one of these years
you're actually gonna remember.

443
00:35:08,265 --> 00:35:09,540
Well, I tell you what.

444
00:35:10,263 --> 00:35:11,818
All we gotta do this morning

445
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,366
is run this stuff out to Pearl station.

446
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,670
Why don't we go up to the Mesa,

447
00:35:18,125 --> 00:35:19,200
drink some beers?

448
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,640
Have some...

449
00:35:25,077 --> 00:35:27,124
I don't know... Father and son time?

450
00:35:30,989 --> 00:35:32,137
I'd like that.

451
00:35:51,163 --> 00:35:53,274
You sure can't say it ain't beautiful.

452
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:08,066
Do you really blame me?

453
00:36:09,043 --> 00:36:10,043
What?

454
00:36:11,604 --> 00:36:14,270
Do you really think it's my fault
that she died?

455
00:36:19,165 --> 00:36:20,165
What do I know?

456
00:36:25,697 --> 00:36:27,620
Why do you keep looking
at your watch?

457
00:36:28,174 --> 00:36:29,353
You got a date?

458
00:36:30,716 --> 00:36:31,723
Listen...

459
00:36:33,853 --> 00:36:35,630
If it makes you feel any better,

460
00:36:37,478 --> 00:36:40,858
I will do my best
to remember your birthday next year.

461
00:36:45,104 --> 00:36:47,270
I don't think that's gonna happen, dad.

462
00:36:49,851 --> 00:36:50,851
What do you mean?

463
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,279
You know, I've missed her, too.

464
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,484
Maybe as much as you have.

465
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:57,764
But the difference is

466
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:02,509
that for as long as I can remember,
I've had to put up with you.

467
00:37:05,102 --> 00:37:09,798
And doing that required
a tremendous amount of patience.

468
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:18,604
Good-bye, dad.

469
00:39:42,416 --> 00:39:43,759
You want us to...

470
00:39:44,279 --> 00:39:45,348
go get his body?

471
00:39:49,707 --> 00:39:51,150
No, leave him out there.

472
00:40:14,798 --> 00:40:16,523
This is where I came from, John.

473
00:40:20,406 --> 00:40:21,806
These are my people...

474
00:40:23,468 --> 00:40:24,972
the Dharma Initiative.

475
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:29,753
They came here seeking harmony...

476
00:40:33,012 --> 00:40:36,409
but they couldn't even coexist
with the island's original inhabitants.

477
00:40:40,043 --> 00:40:42,993
And when it became clear
that one side had to go,

478
00:40:43,934 --> 00:40:45,700
one side had to be purged...

479
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,139
I did what I had to do.

480
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,262
I was one of the people
that was smart enough

481
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:56,728
to make sure that I didn't end up
in that ditch...

482
00:40:57,937 --> 00:41:00,404
Which makes me considerably smarter
than you, John.

483
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:17,045
What did Jacob say to you?

484
00:41:17,978 --> 00:41:19,169
Why did you do this?

485
00:41:19,851 --> 00:41:21,323
Because you heard him.

486
00:41:23,987 --> 00:41:25,817
Now I need to know what he said.

487
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:27,986
"Help me."

488
00:41:30,719 --> 00:41:32,245
I'm not gonna ask you again.

489
00:41:33,414 --> 00:41:34,816
What did he say to you?

490
00:41:37,341 --> 00:41:38,341
He said...

491
00:41:40,153 --> 00:41:41,153
"Help me."

492
00:41:52,486 --> 00:41:54,838
Well, I certainly hope he helps you,
John.
