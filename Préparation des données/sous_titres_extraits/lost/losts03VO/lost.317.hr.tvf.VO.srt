<i>Previously on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:02,253 --> 00:00:04,327
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything, Pal.

3
00:00:04,541 --> 00:00:06,143
How do you know Claire was drowning?

4
00:00:22,896 --> 00:00:24,784
I could hear her calling for help.

5
00:00:24,998 --> 00:00:26,006
You...

6
00:00:26,822 --> 00:00:28,353
Hear the lightning as well?

7
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:44,831
I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie.

8
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:46,523
I was saving you.

9
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:50,069
When I saw the lightning hit the roof,

10
00:00:51,359 --> 00:00:52,855
you were electrocuted,

11
00:00:53,691 --> 00:00:55,915
and when you heard Claire
was in the water...

12
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,056
You drowned trying to save her.

13
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:03,083
I've tried, brother,
I've tried twice to save you,

14
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:04,854
but no matter what I try to do...

15
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:09,338
You're gonna die, Charlie.

16
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:25,150
You're insane, mate.

17
00:01:25,521 --> 00:01:28,519
Superman can fly
round the entire planet

18
00:01:28,776 --> 00:01:30,110
in the blink of an eye.

19
00:01:30,145 --> 00:01:32,626
Dude,
if we're going by a pure foot race,

20
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:35,058
Supes would get dusted by the Flash.

21
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:38,524
But why would the man of steel
agree to a sodding foot race?

22
00:01:39,324 --> 00:01:40,611
Uh, for charity?

23
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:43,859
And Flash would totally win,
'cause he can, like,

24
00:01:44,121 --> 00:01:45,765
vibrate through walls and stuff.

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,628
Vibration.

26
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:50,399
Well and what would Superman do
if he came against a wall?

27
00:01:50,522 --> 00:01:52,193
Well, no smashing allowed.

28
00:01:53,019 --> 00:01:54,652
No flying, no smashing.

29
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,659
Any other restrictions
I need to know about?

30
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:59,860
Perhaps we should fit superman
with a pair of kryptonite...

31
00:02:02,444 --> 00:02:03,542
The hell?

32
00:02:11,033 --> 00:02:12,836
No, don't! Don't touch it.

33
00:02:12,905 --> 00:02:15,277
- My God,my God!
- Just breathe.

34
00:02:15,855 --> 00:02:17,142
Looks like it's homemade.

35
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,315
We've got to get back.

36
00:02:18,353 --> 00:02:20,114
- No! You help!
- I can't help!

37
00:02:21,971 --> 00:02:23,156
I'm sorry, mate.

38
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:44,417
<i>Here it is. Here it is.</i>

39
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:49,008
<i>Superman can fly around
the entire planet...</i>

40
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:23,531
Where's the wire?

41
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:27,297
Did you eat those mushrooms
Jack warned us about?

42
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:28,344
Listen to me.

43
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:31,230
There's a wire,
a cable buried in the sand.

44
00:03:32,968 --> 00:03:34,672
Do you know what I'm talking about?

45
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,091
This is future crap, isn't it?

46
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:38,862
The cable ! Do you know where it is?

47
00:03:40,592 --> 00:03:42,451
- This is important.
- Why?

48
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:46,592
<i>Superman...</i>

49
00:03:52,656 --> 00:03:54,044
Because someone's coming.

50
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:05,515
Subtitles: swsub.com

51
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,168
God tests our faith in many ways.

52
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:52,962
So, as you well know,
we have our own test here...

53
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,080
A vow of silence that lasts
as long as we see fit.

54
00:04:58,323 --> 00:05:00,605
This challenges both one's patience...

55
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:02,376
and his faith.

56
00:05:04,248 --> 00:05:06,931
For some, it may last a week.

57
00:05:08,059 --> 00:05:10,250
Those we're less sure about, a month.

58
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:13,015
Personally, Desmond,

59
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:15,592
I never thought you'd last...

60
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:20,360
and so now I stand corrected.

61
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:25,983
For whatever reason,
your path has led you here.

62
00:05:29,127 --> 00:05:30,515
And now you're one of us.

63
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:35,685
Welcome, brother.

64
00:05:37,395 --> 00:05:38,513
Thank you...

65
00:05:40,562 --> 00:05:41,562
Brother.

66
00:05:49,001 --> 00:05:50,001
Morning, Jack.

67
00:05:54,323 --> 00:05:56,598
Must be nice
to wake up in your own bed.

68
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:00,146
Home, sweet home.

69
00:06:01,296 --> 00:06:03,831
So I was wondering
if I could borrow your first aid kit.

70
00:06:05,926 --> 00:06:06,999
I've...

71
00:06:07,561 --> 00:06:08,561
twisted my ankle.

72
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:15,708
- You want me to take a look at it?
- No, you're all right.

73
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,476
I've taped my share of ankles.

74
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:20,562
Right.

75
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:25,548
Thanks.

76
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,040
Something wrong, Hurley?

77
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:32,839
No, just...

78
00:06:34,252 --> 00:06:35,564
keeping Desmond here company

79
00:06:37,748 --> 00:06:38,914
'cause we're friends.

80
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,751
Bring that back when
you're done with it, okay?

81
00:06:43,752 --> 00:06:44,752
Absolutely.

82
00:06:47,421 --> 00:06:48,774
What the hell was that?

83
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:50,733
Do you want him to get suspicious?

84
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:51,865
Suspicious of what?

85
00:06:54,503 --> 00:06:57,198
Oh, this is like when you knew
Claire was drowning, isn't it?

86
00:06:57,353 --> 00:06:59,966
That's why you got the first aid kit.
Someone's gonna get hurt.

87
00:07:00,103 --> 00:07:02,709
- Is it me?
- No. It's just a precaution.

88
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:05,477
Look, dude, you want me
to take you to the wire?

89
00:07:05,478 --> 00:07:06,700
I want an explanation.

90
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:18,090
I saw a sequence of events...

91
00:07:19,294 --> 00:07:20,905
Things that are gonna happen.

92
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:22,478
What'd you see?

93
00:07:22,824 --> 00:07:23,831
It was...

94
00:07:24,604 --> 00:07:26,604
It was like a sort of jigsaw puzzle,

95
00:07:27,462 --> 00:07:29,215
only I didn't have
the picture on the box,

96
00:07:29,253 --> 00:07:31,056
so I don't know
how the pieces fit exactly.

97
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,257
But one of the pieces.
The first one...

98
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,317
It was you,
pulling the cable out of the sand.

99
00:07:43,418 --> 00:07:45,029
So what are the other pieces?

100
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:49,049
If I tell you that,
it'll change the picture on the box.

101
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:50,602
So what?

102
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:52,503
Isn't that the point...

103
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:53,990
Preventing something bad?

104
00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:55,669
Not this time.

105
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,928
So you're not trying to stop
something from happening.

106
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,145
You actually want it to happen.

107
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:13,845
More than anything.

108
00:08:24,669 --> 00:08:26,152
Hey, Freckles, you home?

109
00:08:27,893 --> 00:08:29,921
Thought you weren't
allowed to use nicknames.

110
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:34,163
You weren't around
when I lost the bet,

111
00:08:34,728 --> 00:08:35,728
so you're...

112
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,227
exempt.

113
00:08:44,604 --> 00:08:45,604
What's up?

114
00:08:46,886 --> 00:08:48,667
I wanted to ask you something.

115
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:53,793
I'm up here.

116
00:08:59,043 --> 00:09:00,154
So did you tell him?

117
00:09:00,728 --> 00:09:01,959
Did I tell who what?

118
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:03,793
You know.

119
00:09:04,548 --> 00:09:06,004
Did you tell the doc...

120
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,230
about you and me?

121
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:14,669
But he knows.

122
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:17,904
He saw us on one
of their surveillance monitors.

123
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:19,346
She said the camera was broken.

124
00:09:19,418 --> 00:09:21,068
Well, they had another camera.

125
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:22,862
Perverts.

126
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,409
Anyway, he knows.

127
00:09:27,126 --> 00:09:29,337
Well, now that that's outta the way...

128
00:09:31,602 --> 00:09:33,446
How about a little afternoon delight?

129
00:09:37,007 --> 00:09:38,510
That means sex.

130
00:09:38,916 --> 00:09:40,829
Come on, Freckles, wait. Now...

131
00:09:41,782 --> 00:09:43,350
Do you need me
to make you a mix tape?

132
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:44,906
Yeah, why don't you do that?

133
00:09:53,348 --> 00:09:55,170
Dude, you're gonna have
to tell me again.

134
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:56,752
What do we need Jin for?

135
00:09:56,917 --> 00:09:58,528
Because he was there with us.

136
00:09:59,353 --> 00:10:01,353
On the beach,
when I find the cable?

137
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,501
<i>This way. Here it is.</i>

138
00:10:05,201 --> 00:10:06,225
That's right.

139
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,956
In one of your puzzle flashes?

140
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:10,292
Aye.

141
00:10:13,354 --> 00:10:15,432
So... If he doesn't come,

142
00:10:16,493 --> 00:10:20,039
then neither does the someone
you won't tell me anything about.

143
00:10:20,229 --> 00:10:22,173
That'd be the long and short of it,

144
00:10:25,450 --> 00:10:29,167
but I've no bloody idea
how I'm gonna get him to come with us.

145
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,852
Watch the master.

146
00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:39,268
- Camping?
- Yeah,

147
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,460
you know, like,
sleeping under the stars,

148
00:10:41,602 --> 00:10:44,678
fire on the beach, marshmallows.

149
00:10:46,684 --> 00:10:47,696
Camping.

150
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,608
Everybody likes marshmallows.

151
00:10:59,163 --> 00:11:00,226
Good man.

152
00:11:00,289 --> 00:11:01,634
Get food, water.

153
00:11:02,914 --> 00:11:04,025
Where are you going?

154
00:11:04,102 --> 00:11:05,102
We need one more.

155
00:11:08,227 --> 00:11:09,727
How daft do you think I am?

156
00:11:10,537 --> 00:11:11,981
This isn't a camping trip.

157
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:16,331
You've had another one
of your visions, haven't you?

158
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:19,270
What was it this time?

159
00:11:22,163 --> 00:11:23,885
Someone's coming to the island.

160
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:25,789
Coming?

161
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,717
As in someone who's not already here?

162
00:11:27,773 --> 00:11:29,510
How the hell is that gonna happen?

163
00:11:31,352 --> 00:11:32,352
I can't tell you.

164
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,884
It's got nothing to do with me?

165
00:11:37,095 --> 00:11:40,025
Well, you're a part of it, yeah,
as are Jin and Hurley.

166
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,912
Right, but with all due respect,

167
00:11:42,992 --> 00:11:45,659
you haven't previously told
Jin or Hurley that they're gonna die.

168
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:50,544
Well, that's not gonna happen,
not this time.

169
00:11:58,632 --> 00:11:59,947
Can I bring my guitar?

170
00:12:01,728 --> 00:12:02,728
Absolutely.

171
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,163
All right, I'm in.

172
00:12:08,048 --> 00:12:10,165
You had me worried there for a second.

173
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:40,693
This is it.

174
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,844
Well, how can you tell?

175
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,048
'Cause that's exactly where
I followed the wire into the jungle.

176
00:12:48,637 --> 00:12:49,691
Where is it, then?

177
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Wait to go, dude§

178
00:12:59,592 --> 00:13:00,592
Here it is !

179
00:13:02,164 --> 00:13:04,549
<i>Here it is!</i>

180
00:13:05,015 --> 00:13:06,589
<i>The beacon fell this side of the rise.</i>

181
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,590
Just one thing...

182
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,777
Last time I followed this wire
into the jungle,

183
00:13:09,778 --> 00:13:12,985
I almost got kebabbed by one
of Rousseau's spiky death trap things.

184
00:13:15,053 --> 00:13:16,452
<i>Cut her down.</i>

185
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:18,092
We're not going in the jungle!

186
00:13:18,151 --> 00:13:19,151
Well, not yet.

187
00:13:19,972 --> 00:13:23,474
It's getting late, so,
we'll camp here the night.

188
00:13:24,965 --> 00:13:25,965
Camp.

189
00:13:29,782 --> 00:13:31,124
So when do they get here...

190
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:34,086
your mysterious someone?

191
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:36,548
Soon.

192
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:48,459
You do realize you are free
to talk again, brother Desmond?

193
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,020
Used to being quiet, I suppose.

194
00:13:55,927 --> 00:13:57,047
Moriah.

195
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,230
I find the name

196
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,499
the brothers have chosen
for the wine made here...

197
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,046
interesting.

198
00:14:05,741 --> 00:14:07,094
And why is that, brother?

199
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:10,479
Well, Moriah is the mountain
where Abraham was asked to kill Isaac.

200
00:14:12,422 --> 00:14:13,977
It's not exactly the most...

201
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,643
festive locale, is it?

202
00:14:15,937 --> 00:14:18,031
And yet God spared Isaac.

203
00:14:18,849 --> 00:14:20,436
Well, one might argue that...

204
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,501
God need not have asked Abraham
to sacrifice his son in the first place.

205
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:29,263
Well, then it wouldn't have been
much of a test, would it, brother?

206
00:14:29,816 --> 00:14:32,483
Perhaps you underestimate
the value of sacrifice.

207
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:35,974
Brother Desmond!

208
00:14:36,359 --> 00:14:37,814
I met this man waiting at the gates.

209
00:14:37,825 --> 00:14:39,513
He says he needs
to have a word with you.

210
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:47,077
Sorry, sir.

211
00:14:56,587 --> 00:14:57,845
Forgive me, brother.

212
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,240
The oatmeal's awesome.

213
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:21,767
It is, huh?

214
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:26,078
It's strange, huh?

215
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,892
What's that?

216
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,251
Being back,

217
00:15:31,078 --> 00:15:32,082
not...

218
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:34,890
looking for a way out of a cage,

219
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:38,806
not finding a reason to go running off
into the jungle again.

220
00:15:39,325 --> 00:15:41,402
I almost don't know
what to do with myself.

221
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:43,013
Well, enjoy it.

222
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,007
I'm sure something
will go wrong soon enough.

223
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:54,269
Well, my big, dangerous
adventure for tonight

224
00:15:54,327 --> 00:15:57,559
is gonna be
doing the dishes in the ocean.

225
00:15:58,718 --> 00:16:00,507
- Well, be careful.
- I'll try.

226
00:16:04,353 --> 00:16:05,602
Can I borrow that spoon?

227
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:15,976
Thanks.

228
00:16:24,782 --> 00:16:25,805
Good night.

229
00:16:26,326 --> 00:16:27,326
Yeah, good night.

230
00:16:56,406 --> 00:16:58,143
What, my doorbell busted again?

231
00:17:00,559 --> 00:17:01,836
What the hell are you doing?

232
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:04,556
Shut up and don't talk.

233
00:17:14,017 --> 00:17:15,017
You crying?

234
00:17:15,077 --> 00:17:16,582
I said shut up.

235
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,576
You got it.

236
00:18:18,871 --> 00:18:20,814
Dude, I love the part about the bird.

237
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:22,735
It was a bird, right?

238
00:18:23,077 --> 00:18:24,078
- You.
- Me?

239
00:18:26,362 --> 00:18:29,440
Have you heard the one
about the chupacabra?

240
00:18:30,564 --> 00:18:31,575
Chupa?

241
00:18:31,642 --> 00:18:33,919
Yeah, it's like a bear with spines,

242
00:18:34,448 --> 00:18:35,481
but Mexican...

243
00:18:35,515 --> 00:18:36,515
Thanks.

244
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,950
Who's that?

245
00:18:48,211 --> 00:18:49,265
Her name's Penny.

246
00:18:50,701 --> 00:18:53,016
That's not bad, Des, not bad at all.

247
00:18:53,639 --> 00:18:57,138
So how did you manage
to leave her behind and come here?

248
00:19:00,135 --> 00:19:01,301
Because I'm a coward.

249
00:19:03,205 --> 00:19:04,248
Sorry.

250
00:19:05,885 --> 00:19:07,116
You and me both, pal.

251
00:19:09,765 --> 00:19:11,821
You know,
I tried to run away from her, and she...

252
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,003
She tracked me down.

253
00:19:15,075 --> 00:19:17,229
"With enough money and determination,

254
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,669
you can find anyone," she said.

255
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,711
You know,
I used to get through my nights

256
00:19:25,344 --> 00:19:28,236
thinking that she actually meant it,
that she never gave up...

257
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,459
that maybe she spent
the last three years...

258
00:19:34,761 --> 00:19:35,761
looking for me.

259
00:19:45,668 --> 00:19:46,748
What's that?

260
00:19:59,024 --> 00:20:00,236
Is that a helicopter?

261
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:01,700
Rescue.

262
00:20:11,074 --> 00:20:13,374
Is that how a helicopter's
supposed to sound?

263
00:20:37,213 --> 00:20:38,424
We gotta go out there.

264
00:20:38,755 --> 00:20:40,286
- Out there?
- Well, yeah.

265
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,760
In what?

266
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:43,381
Well, we gotta do something.

267
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:46,203
Look.

268
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:48,574
Look!

269
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:04,010
My god.

270
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:13,252
No dude, it's not a food drop.
You saw the beacon thing.

271
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:14,662
Someone, like, ejected.

272
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:16,135
Yeah, but that was a helicopter.

273
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:18,024
You can't eject from a helicopter.

274
00:21:18,757 --> 00:21:21,569
Well, maybe they jumped.
All that matters is that they're here.

275
00:21:21,663 --> 00:21:23,841
"They"?
How do we even know it's a person?

276
00:21:23,989 --> 00:21:26,191
Because he said "someone" was coming.

277
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:30,022
Where are you going?

278
00:21:30,385 --> 00:21:31,551
Out to where it fell.

279
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,194
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, slow down.

280
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:36,761
We're not gonna trudge out
into the jungle

281
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,676
- in the middle of the night.
- Yes, we are.

282
00:21:38,868 --> 00:21:42,379
Were you even listening to Hurley
when he mentioned Rousseau's death trap?

283
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:44,597
Now it's gonna be light in two hours.

284
00:21:44,635 --> 00:21:46,448
- We'll wait until...
- She can't wait.

285
00:21:47,635 --> 00:21:48,635
She?

286
00:21:48,701 --> 00:21:50,120
They. Whoever it is...

287
00:21:50,887 --> 00:21:51,887
could be hurt.

288
00:21:52,398 --> 00:21:54,295
We have to go all four of us now.

289
00:21:55,077 --> 00:21:56,077
Why?

290
00:21:56,575 --> 00:21:58,932
Because that's the way
it's supposed to happen.

291
00:22:01,661 --> 00:22:04,816
Right. Well, I guess
it's supposed to happen without me.

292
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,081
<i>Superman...</i>

293
00:22:23,758 --> 00:22:25,406
We'll leave at first light, then...

294
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,510
together.

295
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:32,474
Terrific.

296
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:42,009
Is your sister in?

297
00:22:44,695 --> 00:22:47,167
Leave. Now.

298
00:22:49,434 --> 00:22:50,695
Let him be, Derek.

299
00:22:57,508 --> 00:22:58,508
Hello, Ruth.

300
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,488
So you're a monk now, are you?

301
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:08,192
Well, technically
I'm still what they call a novice,

302
00:23:08,511 --> 00:23:10,877
- till the abbott says...
- Why are you here, Desmond?

303
00:23:13,258 --> 00:23:15,410
Well, now that my initiation is done...

304
00:23:17,397 --> 00:23:19,321
I felt like I owed you an explanation.

305
00:23:22,561 --> 00:23:26,026
You can never begin
to explain what you did.

306
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,065
You left one week before the wedding.

307
00:23:29,194 --> 00:23:31,458
Everything was planned,
bought and paid for.

308
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,500
You just disappeared completely.

309
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:36,008
I had a calling.

310
00:23:37,038 --> 00:23:40,240
We dated for six years,
and the closest you ever came

311
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:43,514
to a religious experience
was Celtic winning the cup.

312
00:23:44,606 --> 00:23:47,348
Yes, I was scared about the wedding,

313
00:23:47,883 --> 00:23:50,343
so I had a few pints, too many, maybe.

314
00:23:52,886 --> 00:23:56,076
I raised my eyes, and I asked,

315
00:23:58,134 --> 00:23:59,745
"am I doing the right thing?"

316
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:02,714
And that's the last thing I remember.

317
00:24:02,883 --> 00:24:05,568
And when I woke up,
I was lying on my back

318
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,225
in the street,
and I don't know how I got there.

319
00:24:08,634 --> 00:24:12,192
And there was this man standing over me,

320
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,874
and he reached out his hand
and he said to me,

321
00:24:17,946 --> 00:24:19,448
"can I help you, brother?"

322
00:24:20,387 --> 00:24:22,044
And the first thing I noticed was...

323
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:24,155
the rope tied around his waist,

324
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:26,521
and I looked at him and...

325
00:24:27,301 --> 00:24:28,846
I knew...

326
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:31,462
I was supposed to go with him.

327
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:34,267
I was supposed to leave...

328
00:24:36,448 --> 00:24:38,225
everything that mattered behind.

329
00:24:39,697 --> 00:24:40,919
Sacrifice all of it...

330
00:24:42,555 --> 00:24:43,917
for a greater calling.

331
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:51,845
Well, it's a good thing
a bloody shepherd didn't help you up,

332
00:24:52,416 --> 00:24:54,931
or I suppose you'd be off
with the sheep, wouldn't you?

333
00:24:57,883 --> 00:25:00,399
Next time you want to break up
with someone, Des,

334
00:25:02,138 --> 00:25:03,472
don't join a monastery.

335
00:25:04,634 --> 00:25:08,044
Just tell the girl
you're too bloody scared.

336
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:19,304
You a doctor or a carpenter?

337
00:25:19,896 --> 00:25:22,262
What, your dad never taught you
to use a hammer?

338
00:25:23,007 --> 00:25:24,895
No, my dad taught me how to drink.

339
00:25:25,446 --> 00:25:27,005
Well, at least it's something.

340
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,514
Hope I'm not interrupting.

341
00:25:33,009 --> 00:25:35,300
You two arguing over
who's your favorite other?

342
00:25:36,198 --> 00:25:37,446
What do you want, Sawyer?

343
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:39,945
Oh, what I wanted, doc,
was to inform you

344
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:42,582
there's been some developments
since you were A.W.O.L.

345
00:25:44,261 --> 00:25:45,261
So tell me...

346
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:50,497
how's your backhand?

347
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:55,573
Where'd you get the table?

348
00:25:55,757 --> 00:25:57,034
Don't you recognize it?

349
00:25:57,322 --> 00:26:00,088
It fell out of the purple haze
when the hatch went blammo.

350
00:26:00,747 --> 00:26:02,480
If we don't play every 108 minutes,

351
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:04,853
the island's gonna explode.

352
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:09,300
Finally, something I can beat you at.

353
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:15,297
You know, considering
I haven't played since I was 12,

354
00:26:15,821 --> 00:26:17,135
I wouldn't be too proud.

355
00:26:18,985 --> 00:26:20,338
What is that, 18-point?

356
00:26:22,623 --> 00:26:23,861
It's kinda strange, huh...

357
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,440
being back?

358
00:26:28,498 --> 00:26:29,498
Something funny?

359
00:26:30,764 --> 00:26:33,005
Kate said the same thing
in the kitchen last night.

360
00:26:34,576 --> 00:26:36,671
- She did?
- She did.

361
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,200
19-point.

362
00:26:46,203 --> 00:26:47,869
So you guys ate together, huh?

363
00:26:48,454 --> 00:26:50,557
No, Juliet and I had dinner together
last night.

364
00:27:02,327 --> 00:27:03,549
Best two out of three?

365
00:27:05,576 --> 00:27:06,576
You got it.

366
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:11,446
So what's next?

367
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:12,575
Next?

368
00:27:12,951 --> 00:27:16,383
Yeah, you saw the wire,
the flashy thing falling out of the sky.

369
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,954
Now what?

370
00:27:17,992 --> 00:27:19,868
- Maybe I can help you find...
- That's it.

371
00:27:20,093 --> 00:27:21,203
There is no next.

372
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:23,196
We find the beacon.

373
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,147
Why are you lying to me, mate?

374
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,386
Look, mate,

375
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:29,266
I've saved your life three times now.

376
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:32,413
If that hasn't bought me your trust,
I don't know what will.

377
00:27:33,894 --> 00:27:34,955
Let's move.

378
00:27:44,648 --> 00:27:45,690
Dude...

379
00:27:46,578 --> 00:27:48,331
seriously, I'm gonna have a coronary.

380
00:27:48,454 --> 00:27:50,950
Actually, you're not,
and if you don't get a move on,

381
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:53,035
we're not gonna make it
before nightfall...

382
00:27:53,781 --> 00:27:54,891
Look at this!

383
00:27:58,048 --> 00:27:59,260
It can't be Rousseau's.

384
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:02,626
If it was Rousseau's, a massive rock
would be flying at my head right now.

385
00:28:04,669 --> 00:28:05,732
Don't move.

386
00:28:06,035 --> 00:28:07,547
- What are you doing?
- Don't move.

387
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:18,947
Did that come down
with the flashing red light thingy?

388
00:28:22,693 --> 00:28:23,726
Walkie-talkie.

389
00:28:26,909 --> 00:28:29,045
No, dude, that's a satellite phone.

390
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,451
Crap, it's dead.

391
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,159
Shocker.

392
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:44,963
My God.

393
00:28:45,866 --> 00:28:46,918
Is that you?

394
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,187
Then who's she?

395
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,558
That would be Penny.

396
00:29:13,444 --> 00:29:14,444
What's this?

397
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:15,805
Your mix tape.

398
00:29:20,645 --> 00:29:22,386
Well, you gonna take it, or ain't you?

399
00:29:24,894 --> 00:29:26,338
"The best of Phil Collins," huh?

400
00:29:26,415 --> 00:29:27,467
Don't get picky.

401
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:30,679
And if Bernard asks,
I don't know a thing about it.

402
00:29:31,273 --> 00:29:32,343
Thanks, James.

403
00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:36,546
So why'd you jump me last night?

404
00:29:38,268 --> 00:29:39,269
What?

405
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,906
Was it 'cause you saw the doc
hanging out with Juliet?

406
00:29:44,418 --> 00:29:45,582
It is not like that.

407
00:29:45,957 --> 00:29:46,957
It's not?

408
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:50,817
You ain't gotta use me, Freckles.

409
00:29:51,959 --> 00:29:53,235
All you gotta do is ask.

410
00:30:05,414 --> 00:30:06,822
You think it's her, don't you?

411
00:30:08,334 --> 00:30:09,334
Who?

412
00:30:10,474 --> 00:30:12,681
Your girl... Penny.

413
00:30:13,975 --> 00:30:17,224
You think it's actually her
who bailed out of the helicopter.

414
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:18,951
Earlier I hoped it.

415
00:30:20,706 --> 00:30:21,706
Now I know it.

416
00:30:25,699 --> 00:30:26,929
Why didn't you tell us?

417
00:30:27,645 --> 00:30:28,978
Would you come if I had?

418
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:30,833
Of course.

419
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:31,958
Why wouldn't I?

420
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:35,246
I didn't wanna tell you because...

421
00:30:37,208 --> 00:30:38,828
I didn't want anything to change.

422
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:40,722
Fair enough.

423
00:30:41,711 --> 00:30:44,583
Look, if whatever you're seeing
leads to your girl getting us rescued,

424
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:46,706
why would we want to change anything?

425
00:30:46,764 --> 00:30:48,018
Right?

426
00:30:49,271 --> 00:30:50,271
Right.

427
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,018
Right.

428
00:31:06,443 --> 00:31:09,344
Thanks for the heads-up
about bringing an umbrella, dude.

429
00:31:35,153 --> 00:31:36,310
Brother Desmond?

430
00:31:37,318 --> 00:31:38,428
What are you doing?

431
00:31:39,685 --> 00:31:43,555
Well, I believe I'm...
getting pissed on our lovely wine.

432
00:31:45,186 --> 00:31:48,592
That bottle of our lovely wine
fetches over 100 quid.

433
00:31:49,794 --> 00:31:52,041
We've only bottled 108 cases this year.

434
00:31:53,624 --> 00:31:56,798
It's just as well we've taken
a vow of poverty then, isn't it?

435
00:31:57,373 --> 00:31:59,261
We've also taken a vow of charity.

436
00:32:02,309 --> 00:32:03,309
Right.

437
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:16,294
Something tells me, Desmond,
that you're not cut out to be a monk.

438
00:32:17,626 --> 00:32:20,002
Well, you know, I've had a tough week.

439
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:28,586
I'm sorry for the wine.

440
00:32:31,012 --> 00:32:32,186
I'll take the penance.

441
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:35,414
I'm afraid
you're beyond penance, Desmond.

442
00:32:37,184 --> 00:32:38,184
Brother Desmond.

443
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:41,121
Not anymore.

444
00:32:44,684 --> 00:32:46,072
Are you firing me?

445
00:32:46,998 --> 00:32:47,998
I am indeed.

446
00:32:50,498 --> 00:32:51,498
You can't do that.

447
00:32:52,273 --> 00:32:54,551
- I heard the call.
- I'm sure you did hear the call,

448
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:57,744
but the abbey clearly isn't where
you are meant to end up.

449
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,657
I have little doubt that God
has different plans

450
00:33:00,713 --> 00:33:03,567
than you being a monk, Desmond...
bigger plans.

451
00:33:03,871 --> 00:33:05,628
- Aye, sure he does.
- He does.

452
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,324
You've just spent
too much time running away

453
00:33:09,418 --> 00:33:11,738
to realize
what you may be running toward.

454
00:33:31,184 --> 00:33:32,795
What am I supposed to do now?

455
00:33:34,621 --> 00:33:35,796
Whatever comes next.

456
00:33:50,746 --> 00:33:51,809
Who's Penny?

457
00:33:52,624 --> 00:33:54,568
She's a chick Desmond used to date,

458
00:33:55,058 --> 00:33:57,040
and now he thinks she fell from the sky.

459
00:33:57,184 --> 00:34:00,504
So we're gonna go save her life,
and she's gonna get us rescued.

460
00:34:06,719 --> 00:34:09,348
Dude, even if I spoke korean,
it wouldn't make any sense.

461
00:34:10,269 --> 00:34:11,874
We'll move faster if we stop talking.

462
00:34:12,064 --> 00:34:13,064
She might be hurt.

463
00:34:14,001 --> 00:34:15,360
I'm moving as fast as I can.

464
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:18,678
In case you haven't noticed, dude,
I'm not exactly the Flash.

465
00:34:18,881 --> 00:34:20,224
The Flash is pathetic.

466
00:34:21,752 --> 00:34:24,202
You got something
against the fastest man alive?

467
00:34:24,935 --> 00:34:26,111
You're insane, mate!

468
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,734
Superman can fly around the entire
planet in the blink of an eye.

469
00:34:29,877 --> 00:34:32,095
Dude, if we're going
by a pure foot race,

470
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:34,126
Supes would get dusted by the Flash.

471
00:34:34,286 --> 00:34:37,657
But why would the man of steel
agree to a sodding foot race?

472
00:34:38,002 --> 00:34:39,253
Uh, for charity?

473
00:34:39,347 --> 00:34:41,367
The Flash would totally win,
'cause he can, like,

474
00:34:41,381 --> 00:34:42,804
vibrate through walls and stuff.

475
00:34:42,876 --> 00:34:44,061
Vibration!

476
00:34:44,245 --> 00:34:46,592
And what would Superman do
if he came up against a wall?

477
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:48,404
Well, no smashing allowed.

478
00:34:50,737 --> 00:34:52,859
No flying, no smashing.

479
00:34:53,029 --> 00:34:55,235
Any other restrictions
I need to know about?

480
00:34:57,417 --> 00:35:01,294
Perhaps we should fit Superman with
a pair of kryptonite ballet slippers...

481
00:35:04,163 --> 00:35:05,215
The hell?

482
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:08,114
Charlie, duck!

483
00:35:20,449 --> 00:35:21,454
Dude.

484
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,860
This way.

485
00:35:34,944 --> 00:35:36,703
No, the beacon
fell this side of the rise.

486
00:35:36,755 --> 00:35:37,755
No, there.

487
00:35:39,256 --> 00:35:40,421
How about we split up?

488
00:35:40,637 --> 00:35:42,806
Me and Charlie'll go that way.
You and Jin go around,

489
00:35:42,898 --> 00:35:44,673
and we'll meet up
at that ridge over there.

490
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:47,074
You and Jin.

491
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:48,778
I'll stick with Desmond.

492
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:00,494
You said "duck."

493
00:36:01,649 --> 00:36:03,889
- Sorry?
- You shouted, "duck."

494
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:08,405
You knew, even before we set off.

495
00:36:08,788 --> 00:36:10,754
- You knew all this time, didn't you?
- Aye.

496
00:36:11,009 --> 00:36:12,512
Then, why didn't you say anything?

497
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:14,933
Because if I told you the truth,
you wouldn't have come.

498
00:36:15,005 --> 00:36:18,663
Oh, you need me to come
'cause I was part of your vision.

499
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:21,096
You thought the only way
you could get your girl back

500
00:36:21,133 --> 00:36:22,645
was if took an arrow in the head.

501
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:25,365
You were gonna sacrifice me.

502
00:36:25,441 --> 00:36:28,061
If the flashes don't happen exactly
as I saw them,

503
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:30,054
the picture changes.

504
00:36:32,577 --> 00:36:34,605
I was supposed to let you die, Charlie.

505
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:36,216
What's that supposed to mean?

506
00:36:36,381 --> 00:36:37,993
It means it's bloody pointless.

507
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:42,252
I keep saving your life,
and what good has it done?

508
00:36:42,563 --> 00:36:44,628
It's just gonna keep happening
again and again.

509
00:36:44,689 --> 00:36:45,868
Maybe that's the point, yeah?

510
00:36:45,905 --> 00:36:47,990
- Maybe it's a test.
- A test?

511
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,636
Like God testing Abraham,
except I failed...

512
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:53,924
Because I changed what I saw.

513
00:37:11,054 --> 00:37:12,227
Hey, can you hear me?

514
00:37:19,072 --> 00:37:20,443
Dude, she's not moving.

515
00:37:23,855 --> 00:37:24,855
I'm sorry, Penny.

516
00:37:26,601 --> 00:37:27,601
I'm sorry.

517
00:37:42,478 --> 00:37:45,098
I was afraid you'd left
without saying good-bye.

518
00:37:45,914 --> 00:37:46,914
No.

519
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,892
I nearly took this with me.

520
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:56,508
If you're not in a hurry,

521
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:59,192
brother Martin's
heading into town in a few hours.

522
00:37:59,354 --> 00:38:00,518
He can give you a ride.

523
00:38:01,726 --> 00:38:04,614
That is, if you don't mind
doing some heavy lifting.

524
00:38:07,103 --> 00:38:08,953
All ten cases are ready to go.

525
00:38:09,879 --> 00:38:12,123
Desmond there
is just getting the last one.

526
00:38:12,605 --> 00:38:15,244
Thank you,
and my father sent the check in advance?

527
00:38:15,352 --> 00:38:17,629
And please thank him
for his generous donation.

528
00:38:17,917 --> 00:38:19,528
Always a pleasure to see you.

529
00:38:23,004 --> 00:38:24,105
Good-bye, Desmond.

530
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:34,251
I think we should be able
to fit it all in the back,

531
00:38:34,289 --> 00:38:36,154
and if not,
we'll put the rest in the front.

532
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:39,790
Is that all right?

533
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,290
Absolutely.

534
00:38:56,104 --> 00:38:57,513
You'd better drive safe, miss.

535
00:38:58,298 --> 00:39:01,291
This vineyard only makes a limited
number of these cases each year.

536
00:39:02,209 --> 00:39:03,270
Is that so?

537
00:39:03,317 --> 00:39:05,284
Aye. It's because the monks are lazy.

538
00:39:06,612 --> 00:39:09,213
You know, it's easier
making grape jelly than wine.

539
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,047
And how do you know so much
about monks?

540
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:13,305
I'm an ex-monk.

541
00:39:13,443 --> 00:39:14,478
Really?

542
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,540
As of last night.

543
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:18,165
I was fired.

544
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:21,856
Well, it wasn't that funny.

545
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:24,119
I'm sorry. I've never... I've...

546
00:39:24,335 --> 00:39:25,987
I didn't know monks could be fired.

547
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:27,228
Oh, they can.

548
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:30,382
You know, I was told
in no uncertain terms

549
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:33,471
that the abbey
wasn't where I was meant to end up,

550
00:39:33,915 --> 00:39:34,915
just a...

551
00:39:35,963 --> 00:39:37,127
step along the path.

552
00:39:37,315 --> 00:39:39,869
You know,
God allegedly has bigger plans for me.

553
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,841
Something tells me
you don't entirely believe that.

554
00:39:47,907 --> 00:39:49,371
I suspect that's because I don't.

555
00:39:49,979 --> 00:39:51,183
Well, maybe they're right.

556
00:39:51,218 --> 00:39:52,913
I just think,
if you hadn't gotten fired,

557
00:39:52,914 --> 00:39:54,383
we wouldn't have met,
and then...

558
00:39:54,739 --> 00:39:57,998
how could you possibly help me
unload these crates in Carlisle?

559
00:39:59,687 --> 00:40:01,707
Did I say
I was coming to Carlisle with you?

560
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:03,624
Not yet.

561
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:17,082
I mean, of course,
if an ex-monk already has plans...

562
00:40:17,187 --> 00:40:19,621
You know, I don't usually get into cars
with strangers.

563
00:40:19,935 --> 00:40:21,768
Well, in that case, I'm Penelope.

564
00:40:24,749 --> 00:40:25,749
Penny.

565
00:40:27,811 --> 00:40:28,811
Desmond.

566
00:40:31,624 --> 00:40:33,011
Very nice to meet you, Penny.

567
00:40:43,748 --> 00:40:44,748
She's alive.

568
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:48,091
Stand back!

569
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:50,186
Get away from her!

570
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:54,613
I'm here. I'm here, Penny.

571
00:40:55,173 --> 00:40:57,126
- Be careful.
- Just get off, Charlie.

572
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:59,235
Sorry, Penny. Sorry.

573
00:41:07,296 --> 00:41:08,376
Desmond?
