1
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,601
You got this thing
running yet, buddy?

2
00:00:33,323 --> 00:00:35,211
Nah, but I got your tools all set.

3
00:00:35,983 --> 00:00:38,210
See if we can get this thing started,
okay?

4
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:40,623
I thought we needed
a new carburettor.

5
00:00:40,783 --> 00:00:41,949
Well, maybe we don't.

6
00:00:42,477 --> 00:00:45,082
Come on. Slide behind the wheel.
We'll fire this up.

7
00:00:53,948 --> 00:00:55,491
What's the matter? Go ahead.

8
00:01:11,633 --> 00:01:12,885
This is stupid.

9
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,236
Without a new carburettor,
it's not gonna work.

10
00:01:15,427 --> 00:01:17,395
Having hope is never stupid.

11
00:01:17,937 --> 00:01:19,814
You gotta believe
good things will happen,

12
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:20,902
and then they will.

13
00:01:21,176 --> 00:01:22,527
Understand what I'm saying?

14
00:01:23,836 --> 00:01:25,148
In this world, son,

15
00:01:26,055 --> 00:01:27,610
You gotta make your own luck.

16
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:31,465
All right? All right. Come on.

17
00:01:34,857 --> 00:01:37,944
Well, what do you want to fix today?

18
00:01:40,583 --> 00:01:42,925
We're gonna have to put that on hold
for a little while,

19
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:46,091
'cause I gotta go to Vegas.

20
00:01:46,835 --> 00:01:48,549
You know, I got some work out there.

21
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:51,988
- What about the road trip?
- The grand canyon will still be there

22
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:53,570
when I get back, little dude.

23
00:01:54,792 --> 00:01:56,277
I got something for you.

24
00:01:57,953 --> 00:01:59,786
I'm... not supposed to, Mom says.

25
00:02:00,504 --> 00:02:02,947
Live a little, Hugo.
It's just a candy bar, okay?

26
00:02:06,406 --> 00:02:09,507
All right. I'll be back
before you know it, all right?

27
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,215
Hold down the fort?
You're my man? All right.

28
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:01,125
So then the others
take the bags of our heads,

29
00:03:01,234 --> 00:03:04,070
and we're, like
on the other side of the island.

30
00:03:04,119 --> 00:03:07,206
And they take Jack,
Kate and Sawyer someplace,

31
00:03:07,294 --> 00:03:11,746
and they sent me back
to warn everyone to stay away...

32
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
which I did...

33
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:17,257
And now, everyone's freaked out.

34
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,188
With them gone,
and what happened to Eko,

35
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,685
they're all scared.

36
00:03:29,703 --> 00:03:30,744
And I'm scared.

37
00:03:34,373 --> 00:03:35,415
But then I've...

38
00:03:37,107 --> 00:03:39,306
been scared most
of my time here, anyway...

39
00:03:46,251 --> 00:03:47,639
Except when I'm with you.

40
00:03:52,616 --> 00:03:54,003
I miss you, Libby.

41
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:18,386
Bloody hell.

42
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,342
Dude, you okay?

43
00:04:20,436 --> 00:04:21,436
Peachy.

44
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:24,564
Really? 'Cause you've
kinda been moping the last--

45
00:04:24,648 --> 00:04:27,037
Look, it's not worth
talking about, Hurley, okay?

46
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:28,873
Dude, you can tell me anything.

47
00:04:33,997 --> 00:04:35,019
Desmond...

48
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:37,641
... said I was gonna die.

49
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,899
He told me he has these flashes...

50
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,141
visions, whatever...

51
00:04:42,536 --> 00:04:44,088
and in them, I always die.

52
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:51,942
So this is the part where

53
00:04:52,838 --> 00:04:56,794
you tell me, "It's ridiculous.
Don't be daft. He's a nutter."

54
00:04:57,805 --> 00:04:59,199
I think he might be right.

55
00:05:01,194 --> 00:05:02,892
And I think it might be my fault.

56
00:05:03,658 --> 00:05:04,658
Your fault?

57
00:05:06,318 --> 00:05:07,704
I'm... kinda cursed.

58
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,905
Death finds me, dude.

59
00:05:18,132 --> 00:05:19,132
Vincent?

60
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:22,987
Is that an arm?

61
00:05:29,296 --> 00:05:30,296
Here, Vincent.

62
00:05:30,336 --> 00:05:32,578
Come here. I think we need to get that.

63
00:05:33,406 --> 00:05:35,798
Yeah, chase the dog
with the skeletal arm

64
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,895
into the creepy jungle.
You be my guest.

65
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:41,468
If I'm not back in three hours,
tell somebody.

66
00:06:52,273 --> 00:06:53,371
Awesome.

67
00:06:58,383 --> 00:07:09,484
Subtitles: www.swsub.com

68
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,976
It's everyone's fantasy,
winning the lottery.

69
00:07:13,554 --> 00:07:16,216
Untold millions falling
into your lap overnight.

70
00:07:16,804 --> 00:07:18,915
What would you do
with all that money?

71
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:22,886
Well, one such lucky winner
recently bought a chicken shack.

72
00:07:23,508 --> 00:07:25,494
I'm Tricia Tanaka
with Hugo Reyes,

73
00:07:25,814 --> 00:07:29,309
Winner of a record $114 million,

74
00:07:29,578 --> 00:07:32,433
outside Mr. Cluck's
Chicken Shack in Diamond Bar,

75
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:35,349
which will be having
its grand reopening tomorrow.

76
00:07:35,951 --> 00:07:38,459
So, Hugo, I think
the question on everyone's mind

77
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:40,410
is why did you buy Mr. Cluck's?

78
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:45,747
I like chicken.

79
00:07:49,811 --> 00:07:54,441
Also with us is Hugo's
former boss and now employee,

80
00:07:54,602 --> 00:07:55,739
Randy Nations.

81
00:07:56,228 --> 00:07:59,103
That's probably
every working stiff's fantasy,

82
00:07:59,142 --> 00:08:00,375
isn't it, Mr. Reyes?

83
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:07,142
Okay, so, Hugo,
tell us what else you've done

84
00:08:07,176 --> 00:08:08,939
since you got on your lucky streak.

85
00:08:09,931 --> 00:08:12,574
Actually, I've kind of
had some bad luck, too.

86
00:08:12,745 --> 00:08:15,697
My grandpa Tito died of a heart attack,

87
00:08:15,951 --> 00:08:18,460
and the first house I bought
my mom burnt down.

88
00:08:18,588 --> 00:08:21,532
My friend Johnny ran off
with my girlfriend Starla...

89
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:24,032
And this guy jumped off
my accountant's roof.

90
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:25,250
Cut!

91
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:27,667
What the hell was that?

92
00:08:29,315 --> 00:08:31,884
It's a puff piece, Mr. Reyes.
Do you know what that is?

93
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:36,541
Sorry, Tricia Tanaka.

94
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:41,123
Do you mind if we go inside
and shoot some b-roll?

95
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,316
- I don't know...
- Yeah. Of course you can.

96
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:47,218
He's just superstitious.
You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet.

97
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:51,625
Okay, let's go. God, I hate this.

98
00:08:52,118 --> 00:08:54,796
- I always get the stupid stories.
- Hey, you sure it's okay?

99
00:08:55,751 --> 00:08:56,751
Yeah, relax.

100
00:08:57,358 --> 00:08:58,931
The safety guards are on the fryers?

101
00:08:59,076 --> 00:09:00,503
Those fryers are stone-cold.

102
00:09:00,561 --> 00:09:02,722
All right? We don't even start cooking
till tomorrow.

103
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,883
You hear something?

104
00:09:06,092 --> 00:09:07,635
And then pan through the...

105
00:09:57,522 --> 00:09:59,663
Well, we are out of Dharma oat bars.

106
00:10:00,457 --> 00:10:01,767
- Already?
- Yep.

107
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:03,959
Did you check behind the powdered milk?

108
00:10:04,036 --> 00:10:06,737
- Yeah. It's not there.
- You pass me the box of cereal?

109
00:10:07,465 --> 00:10:08,865
Then I guess we're out of them.

110
00:10:09,071 --> 00:10:12,504
Will you... pass me... the cereal?

111
00:10:15,945 --> 00:10:18,667
From now on, I will only
speak to you in English.

112
00:10:18,753 --> 00:10:20,065
It's how you will learn.

113
00:10:23,002 --> 00:10:24,543
It will be hard at first...

114
00:10:28,353 --> 00:10:29,867
Hey, everyone!

115
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,294
Hurley, what is it?

116
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,517
Is it the others?

117
00:10:33,074 --> 00:10:34,683
- Are you okay?
- What's going on, man?

118
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:36,926
Car.

119
00:10:38,411 --> 00:10:41,132
I found a car tipped over in the jungle.

120
00:10:42,698 --> 00:10:43,843
You found a... car.

121
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,521
And we can totally fix it!

122
00:10:45,843 --> 00:10:48,470
And get it going again.
It's not far. Come on.

123
00:10:49,646 --> 00:10:51,312
Why do we need to start a car?

124
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:54,588
Because it'll be fun.

125
00:10:56,724 --> 00:10:58,132
We could all use some fun.

126
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:00,278
I mean, after everything
that's happened,

127
00:11:00,357 --> 00:11:01,397
we need it.

128
00:11:03,418 --> 00:11:04,584
Especially you, dude.

129
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:07,566
So who's with me?

130
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:12,845
Well, I... gotta get some bananas.
Sorry.

131
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:15,378
- I don't think so, Hurley.
- Sorry, Hurley.

132
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:21,529
Come on! Anyone?
We're gonna drive it!

133
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Who's coming?

134
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:34,218
Thanks, dude.

135
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,777
You have no idea
what you volunteered for, do you?

136
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:45,425
Come on.

137
00:11:46,475 --> 00:11:47,592
Are we there yet?

138
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:51,107
If we are where I think we are,

139
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,004
then our beach should be
just through those trees.

140
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:55,605
We'll be home
in about five minutes.

141
00:11:56,307 --> 00:11:58,236
Try to contain
your excitement, Freckles.

142
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,655
Forgive me if I'm
not excited about explaining

143
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:03,206
why there's only two of us
coming back, James.

144
00:12:03,436 --> 00:12:06,339
Well, maybe they should explain
why they ain't come looking for us.

145
00:12:08,366 --> 00:12:10,254
In fact, I'd be surprised if Loc...

146
00:12:11,372 --> 00:12:13,051
- What happened?
- Stepped on something.

147
00:12:13,052 --> 00:12:14,575
- Son of a bitch!
- Here, let me see.

148
00:12:14,671 --> 00:12:16,060
Looks like a... dart.

149
00:12:16,273 --> 00:12:17,759
How the hell did it get out here?

150
00:12:17,851 --> 00:12:19,564
Just relax your foot for a second, okay?

151
00:12:19,602 --> 00:12:21,898
I'm gonna pull it out
on the count of three. You ready?

152
00:12:22,672 --> 00:12:23,675
One...

153
00:12:25,408 --> 00:12:26,739
I thought you said three.

154
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,665
Yeah, well,
anticipation's the worst part.

155
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,221
I thought I would spare you.

156
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:43,010
You know,
all you have to do is say sorry.

157
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:45,903
We could start again,

158
00:12:46,489 --> 00:12:47,978
give each other a clean slate.

159
00:12:49,017 --> 00:12:50,017
Slate...

160
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,103
like on "little house"?

161
00:12:53,082 --> 00:12:54,124
What?

162
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:55,533
"Little house on the prairie"?

163
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,564
Laura Ingalls used to write
on this little chalkboard at school?

164
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,989
You call it "little house"?

165
00:13:02,186 --> 00:13:05,040
I had mono when I was a kid.
I missed two months of school.

166
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:07,152
We only got one channel in my trailer.

167
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:11,877
What are we even talking about?

168
00:13:16,113 --> 00:13:17,683
We ain't talking about nothing.

169
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,778
And I ain't got nothing to be sorry for.

170
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,393
So that's how it's gonna be?

171
00:13:32,207 --> 00:13:33,465
Welcome home, Sawyer.

172
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:40,105
Welcome home, Kate.

173
00:14:40,264 --> 00:14:43,100
Hugo? Is that you, Hugo?

174
00:14:44,807 --> 00:14:45,807
Oh, my God.

175
00:14:47,163 --> 00:14:48,163
What happened?

176
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:49,527
Tricia Tanaka's dead.

177
00:14:50,213 --> 00:14:51,523
- What?
- Mr. Cluck's...

178
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:52,989
it got hit by a meteor...

179
00:14:54,567 --> 00:14:55,567
or an asteroid...

180
00:14:57,478 --> 00:15:00,273
I don't know the difference,
but it's gone.

181
00:15:00,578 --> 00:15:01,578
That's crazy.

182
00:15:01,665 --> 00:15:03,382
It's not crazy. It's the lottery money.

183
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:05,780
The numbers-- I'm cursed.
And now Tricia Tanaka's dead,

184
00:15:05,817 --> 00:15:07,862
and her camera dude,
and it's all my fault.

185
00:15:09,613 --> 00:15:11,195
It was an accident.

186
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:14,157
It's not an accident. It is a curse.

187
00:15:14,451 --> 00:15:15,800
There's only one way to stop it.

188
00:15:15,801 --> 00:15:18,274
- I have to go to australia.
- Again with australia?

189
00:15:18,358 --> 00:15:20,121
That's where the numbers came from.

190
00:15:20,465 --> 00:15:22,576
Lenny in the institution-- he told me.

191
00:15:22,767 --> 00:15:24,656
Hugo, wait.

192
00:15:25,417 --> 00:15:28,258
I can prove to you you're not cursed.

193
00:15:29,623 --> 00:15:30,968
- You can?
- Yes.

194
00:15:31,927 --> 00:15:32,927
Come here with me.

195
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:34,778
I have to show you something.

196
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:46,306
After 17 years,
your father has returned.

197
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:52,831
Your mom wasn't kidding
about those candy bars.

198
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,662
Just kidding.

199
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:01,268
Poor...

200
00:16:02,571 --> 00:16:03,571
Roger.

201
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,426
Sorry about your arm, dude.

202
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:16,512
In. In.

203
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:18,204
Totally. Let's check it out.

204
00:16:25,162 --> 00:16:27,651
Dude, Roger was on a beer run.

205
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,018
Oh, man, I suck at charades.
You want to what?

206
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,475
Oh, you wanna take roger out...

207
00:16:43,299 --> 00:16:45,884
then and turn it over? Cool.
I understand!

208
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:53,528
Okay, on three.

209
00:16:56,137 --> 00:16:57,198
One...

210
00:16:58,309 --> 00:16:59,332
two...

211
00:17:00,692 --> 00:17:01,692
three.

212
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:12,617
We'll get that later.

213
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:23,666
So when's it gonna happen?

214
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:30,212
- When's what gonna happen?
- Don't play stupid with me... brother.

215
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:37,492
I was drunk.
You know, if I said anything--

216
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:39,826
I have a right to know
when I'm gonna die.

217
00:17:41,897 --> 00:17:44,401
- It doesn't work like that.
- What doesn't work like that?

218
00:17:44,553 --> 00:17:45,553
Hey, Oliver Twist.

219
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:49,902
- Where the hell's my stuff?
- What stuff?

220
00:17:49,941 --> 00:17:52,121
Oh, you know
good and damn well what stuff!

221
00:17:52,361 --> 00:17:55,077
I had books, food, porno,
a bottle of scotch.

222
00:17:55,169 --> 00:17:57,423
Aye, apologies for the scotch, mate.

223
00:17:59,423 --> 00:18:00,502
You drank it?

224
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:04,093
Well, to be fair, there was,
there was three of us.

225
00:18:05,982 --> 00:18:06,982
Yeah, there was.

226
00:18:07,881 --> 00:18:09,437
You, the munchkin and who else?

227
00:18:17,301 --> 00:18:18,301
Oh, I got it.

228
00:18:18,801 --> 00:18:20,888
We're gonna tip it up. Crafty.

229
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:23,216
Crafty?

230
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,871
Yeah, crafty.

231
00:18:25,224 --> 00:18:28,871
It's like...
when you're good at... crafts.

232
00:18:31,686 --> 00:18:32,766
Never mind.

233
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,695
Where the hell's my stuff?

234
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:38,197
- What are y'all doing?
- Dude! You're alive!

235
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:44,819
Yeah, yeah, snuffy.
It's good to see you, too.

236
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:48,325
I'll be damn.
Y'all found yourselves a hippie car.

237
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:49,405
Pretty cool, huh?

238
00:18:49,459 --> 00:18:50,770
- Sawyer.
- Jin-Bo.

239
00:18:52,114 --> 00:18:53,114
How you doing?

240
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:55,775
Good... see you.

241
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:59,096
Well, look at that.
Somebody's hooked on phonics.

242
00:18:59,981 --> 00:19:02,452
What about Jack and Kate?
They with you? They all right?

243
00:19:02,686 --> 00:19:03,686
Kate's with me...

244
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,436
but the doc... they still got him.

245
00:19:08,593 --> 00:19:09,593
Okay, it's okay.

246
00:19:10,244 --> 00:19:13,178
It's gonna be all right.
Jack's gonna be all right. We all are.

247
00:19:13,717 --> 00:19:16,229
- Well, what a relief.
- Nah, see, things are getting better.

248
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,286
The car, you coming back safely--
It's a sign.

249
00:19:19,432 --> 00:19:21,207
Yeah, a sign I want my stuff back.

250
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,576
You're gonna help to fix this thing.

251
00:19:25,119 --> 00:19:26,777
And why in the hell would I do that?

252
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:29,010
'Cause there's beer.

253
00:19:32,146 --> 00:19:33,902
Why did he say, "don't come back"?

254
00:19:33,931 --> 00:19:36,060
He sacrificed himself
so we could escape.

255
00:19:36,185 --> 00:19:38,393
Probably didn't want it
to be for nothing.

256
00:19:38,737 --> 00:19:40,934
Hurley told us
they released Michael and Walt.

257
00:19:41,323 --> 00:19:43,175
Yep. They gave Michael a boat.

258
00:19:43,246 --> 00:19:44,905
They took off and never looked back.

259
00:19:45,006 --> 00:19:46,439
Did you see any other boats?

260
00:19:46,954 --> 00:19:49,869
No, but something tells me
they didn't give away their only one.

261
00:19:52,417 --> 00:19:53,690
So they can leave the island?

262
00:19:54,313 --> 00:19:55,374
I don't know, John.

263
00:19:56,066 --> 00:19:59,232
This "zoo" where they held you--
Is that where they live?

264
00:20:00,823 --> 00:20:03,177
We escaped with one of them--
a kid named Karl.

265
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,270
He said that they live on this island.

266
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:07,534
He could've taken us there,
but Sawyer let him go.

267
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:09,788
- Why?
- You're gonna have to ask Sawyer.

268
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:13,900
- Kate, where are you going?
- I don't care what Jack said.

269
00:20:15,351 --> 00:20:18,146
They've got him, and we have
to get him back. I owe him that...

270
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:20,226
So I'm going to get help.

271
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:22,359
Help from who?

272
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,126
Now that's a hell of a Jesus.

273
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:33,847
Yes. Hugo is such a good son.

274
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:36,535
He knows of my love for the Savior,

275
00:20:36,813 --> 00:20:39,453
so he commissioned artisans in Taxco

276
00:20:39,611 --> 00:20:43,036
to custom carve for me
this statue in solid gold.

277
00:20:46,217 --> 00:20:47,719
That smells like great lasagna.

278
00:20:48,523 --> 00:20:50,586
The Trons made it themselves.

279
00:20:51,785 --> 00:20:55,547
Hugo found them in Bennigan's.
Now they are our butlers.

280
00:20:58,254 --> 00:20:59,560
Something wrong, Hugo?

281
00:21:01,142 --> 00:21:03,093
Your father asked you a question, Hugo.

282
00:21:04,479 --> 00:21:05,501
My father?

283
00:21:06,632 --> 00:21:08,149
You're acting like he never left us,

284
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:10,401
like he hasn't been gone for 17 years.

285
00:21:10,713 --> 00:21:12,141
And all of a sudden he shows up?

286
00:21:12,213 --> 00:21:14,385
Aren't you at least a little suspicious?

287
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:17,373
I showed up because your mom called
and said you were in trouble.

288
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:21,301
- What?
- All these numbers and curse.

289
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:23,760
Hugo, I don't know what to do anymore.

290
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,979
I thought you need a manly influence,

291
00:21:26,075 --> 00:21:28,539
a father to get you
to stop this nonsense.

292
00:21:28,645 --> 00:21:29,645
I'm not crazy!

293
00:21:29,994 --> 00:21:33,195
And the only reason he's back
is 'cause he wants the money.

294
00:21:33,298 --> 00:21:34,353
Oh, now that hurts.

295
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:36,797
Well, guess what?
There isn't gonna be any money.

296
00:21:37,948 --> 00:21:39,684
Mr. Tron, lady Tron.

297
00:21:39,905 --> 00:21:41,704
Your services will no longer be need.

298
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:44,982
Severance. Trust me,
I'm doing you a huge favor.

299
00:21:45,067 --> 00:21:47,397
It's only a matter of time
before the curse gets you,

300
00:21:47,568 --> 00:21:49,883
and you... die, or worse.

301
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:53,643
- What are you doing?
- Getting rid of it,

302
00:21:53,781 --> 00:21:57,002
all of it--
The money, the houses, the livestock...

303
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:58,355
And I'm starting with him.

304
00:21:58,452 --> 00:22:00,435
No, Hugo.
Your father is staying with us.

305
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:01,713
Staying with us? Where?

306
00:22:03,192 --> 00:22:05,275
It's been 17 years, Hugo.

307
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:06,949
What's been 17 years?

308
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:14,101
I have needs.

309
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:21,819
This can't be happening! He has to go!

310
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,320
He has to! I want him gone!

311
00:22:23,424 --> 00:22:25,207
- No, you don't!
- Yeah, I do!

312
00:22:25,371 --> 00:22:27,927
Why don't you show your father
what you have in the garage?

313
00:22:41,438 --> 00:22:42,923
I can't believe it.

314
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:46,052
You saved it.

315
00:23:11,637 --> 00:23:13,238
Me first now. Come on.

316
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:16,373
What's up with all this recycling?

317
00:23:17,101 --> 00:23:18,101
You got me, dude.

318
00:23:22,164 --> 00:23:24,994
Looks like those Dharma freaks
were building some sort of dirt road.

319
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,439
Now we're talkin'.

320
00:23:33,195 --> 00:23:35,555
Looks good to me. Engine's fine, right?

321
00:23:35,691 --> 00:23:36,691
Son of...

322
00:23:37,999 --> 00:23:39,430
What's a head doing back here?

323
00:23:39,747 --> 00:23:41,168
Oh, that's just Roger.

324
00:23:43,465 --> 00:23:45,414
I'm gonna start the car now!

325
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,464
Engine...

326
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,097
Dude, even if you were speaking english,

327
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:55,071
I wouldn't understand a word
you're saying.

328
00:23:55,285 --> 00:23:57,239
Just relax. We're good. This'll work.

329
00:24:02,485 --> 00:24:03,544
I have hope.

330
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:06,247
This will work.

331
00:24:19,275 --> 00:24:20,275
Damn it.

332
00:24:28,285 --> 00:24:30,005
It's flat, and it stinks.

333
00:24:30,764 --> 00:24:32,650
Can you get it to work?
You know what's wrong?

334
00:24:32,669 --> 00:24:34,348
Chill out. Let the man do his thing.

335
00:24:34,525 --> 00:24:37,786
Dude, that beer's been sitting there
since before "Rocky III,"

336
00:24:38,356 --> 00:24:40,590
maybe even "II."
It's probably poison by now.

337
00:24:41,048 --> 00:24:43,691
Skeletor seems to like it. Bottoms up.

338
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:47,805
That's not cool, dude.
That guy had a mom, a family

339
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:49,067
and friends.

340
00:24:49,222 --> 00:24:52,231
Oh, and a name.
Not Skeletor. It's Roger Workman.

341
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,842
It's workman, you blockhead.

342
00:24:56,322 --> 00:24:59,216
That's his job.
He was a Dharma janitor.

343
00:24:59,573 --> 00:25:01,522
Yeah,
well you should still respect the dead.

344
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:06,768
Can you fix it?

345
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:09,815
No fix.

346
00:25:14,265 --> 00:25:15,539
But you have to!

347
00:25:16,484 --> 00:25:18,841
Can't you try, dude?
I mean, we gotta get this running!

348
00:25:19,053 --> 00:25:22,159
Leave the man alone.
He's right. "No fix."

349
00:25:22,445 --> 00:25:23,795
Take a look at that mess.

350
00:25:23,863 --> 00:25:26,275
There's no way it's gonna get running.
How thick are you?

351
00:25:26,373 --> 00:25:27,761
What's your problem, man?

352
00:25:28,185 --> 00:25:29,628
Why don't you want this to work?

353
00:25:29,629 --> 00:25:32,232
I don't care if it works.
Why is it so important to you?

354
00:25:32,290 --> 00:25:34,251
Because we could all use a little hope.

355
00:25:34,439 --> 00:25:36,036
If it's hope you're looking for, I say,

356
00:25:36,037 --> 00:25:37,814
you're on the wrong damn island.

357
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:40,927
'Cause there sure as hell
ain't no hope here.

358
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:55,402
Come on Hugo, time to get up!

359
00:25:55,564 --> 00:25:57,812
Come on! Rise and shine.

360
00:25:57,868 --> 00:26:00,542
Hit the deck. Come on,
we're burning daylight. Let's go.

361
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:03,699
What's with the earphones?

362
00:26:04,597 --> 00:26:05,658
It's for the noise.

363
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:08,481
Well, your mother's
a very passionate woman.

364
00:26:09,223 --> 00:26:10,792
That is disgusting.

365
00:26:10,873 --> 00:26:12,881
Come on.
We're going on an adventure. Let's go.

366
00:26:13,076 --> 00:26:14,491
I'm not going anywhere with you.

367
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:16,992
Look, just do this one thing with me.

368
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:19,774
If it doesn't work,
you can go to Australia.

369
00:26:20,086 --> 00:26:21,282
I won't stop you. Okay?

370
00:26:23,274 --> 00:26:24,432
What one thing?

371
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:27,400
We're gonna break the curse.

372
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:30,898
This is stupid.

373
00:26:31,797 --> 00:26:33,249
Just give her a chance, man.

374
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,754
Cut the deck, please.

375
00:26:47,945 --> 00:26:50,590
You've recently come
into a great deal of money.

376
00:26:50,677 --> 00:26:52,271
Could've seen that on the news.

377
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,492
But it hasn't brought you happiness.

378
00:27:00,743 --> 00:27:02,210
It's brought you great misfortune.

379
00:27:04,253 --> 00:27:05,900
She didn't see that on the news.

380
00:27:07,112 --> 00:27:08,257
I'm seeing numbers.

381
00:27:09,153 --> 00:27:11,023
What numbers?- 4,

382
00:27:11,726 --> 00:27:13,171
8, 15,

383
00:27:13,324 --> 00:27:14,282
16,

384
00:27:14,855 --> 00:27:15,775
23,

385
00:27:16,471 --> 00:27:17,476
42.

386
00:27:19,715 --> 00:27:21,771
There's darkness around these numbers...

387
00:27:23,327 --> 00:27:24,406
great tragedy.

388
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:33,385
I'm... I'm sorry.

389
00:27:33,607 --> 00:27:35,035
What? What is it?

390
00:27:36,778 --> 00:27:37,801
Death...

391
00:27:38,593 --> 00:27:39,593
... surrounds you...

392
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,135
and...

393
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,188
more is coming.

394
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:47,336
Your hands, please.

395
00:27:50,711 --> 00:27:52,099
There's a curse on you.

396
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:55,595
But it can be removed.

397
00:28:00,287 --> 00:28:02,540
Now, Hugo,
I need you to remove your clothes.

398
00:28:05,363 --> 00:28:06,386
My clothes?

399
00:28:07,043 --> 00:28:10,178
A curse is like an unwelcome entity
that lives inside you,

400
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,540
and it must be exorcised.

401
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,843
Did my dad put you up to this?

402
00:28:26,424 --> 00:28:28,026
- What?
- Hugo, please.

403
00:28:29,328 --> 00:28:30,859
I'll give you $1,000 right now

404
00:28:30,879 --> 00:28:33,032
If you admit that
my dad told you to say this stuff.

405
00:28:33,052 --> 00:28:35,453
The mystic arts
are not subject to bribes.

406
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,241
- How dare you--
- $10,000.

407
00:28:37,332 --> 00:28:38,605
Your dad put me up to it.

408
00:28:47,714 --> 00:28:48,899
I was just trying to help.

409
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:52,490
Help who?

410
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:01,842
Beer.

411
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:06,074
Bingo. Beautiful.

412
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,247
Car.

413
00:29:16,106 --> 00:29:17,610
International house of pancakes.

414
00:29:19,937 --> 00:29:21,519
What are you doing over there?

415
00:29:22,672 --> 00:29:23,672
I'm praying.

416
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:25,691
- Praying for what?
- Help.

417
00:29:26,777 --> 00:29:29,439
Well, hell,
I got you a little help right here.

418
00:29:44,297 --> 00:29:45,474
Stop moping. Come on.

419
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:49,204
I'm not moping. I'm thinking.

420
00:29:49,369 --> 00:29:51,757
When people stare out at the ocean

421
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,810
and get all quiet-like, they're moping.

422
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:55,458
So get up and come with me.

423
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:57,919
That car I found--
we're getting it running.

424
00:29:58,981 --> 00:30:00,158
What's the point?

425
00:30:02,535 --> 00:30:04,460
- What did you do that for?
- Snap out of it.

426
00:30:04,534 --> 00:30:07,784
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
'Cause someone said you're gonna die.

427
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:10,294
I got an idea that's gonna help us both.

428
00:30:10,611 --> 00:30:11,624
Now...

429
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,379
... it is dangerous,

430
00:30:14,153 --> 00:30:16,461
and there's a very good chance
that you will die.

431
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:19,322
This is supposed
to convince me to come with you?

432
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:21,278
It is, 'cause if you don't die,

433
00:30:22,566 --> 00:30:24,204
- then we win.
- Win?

434
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:25,850
Look, I don't know about you,

435
00:30:26,418 --> 00:30:28,251
but things have really sucked for me
lately,

436
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:29,847
and I could really use a victory.

437
00:30:30,221 --> 00:30:33,054
So let's get one, dude.
Let's get this car started.

438
00:30:33,666 --> 00:30:35,920
Let's look death in the face
and say, "whatever, man."

439
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:38,520
Let's make our own luck.
What do you say?

440
00:30:45,236 --> 00:30:46,295
I'm sorry.

441
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:53,606
Okay, nice. Keep it coming.

442
00:30:56,413 --> 00:30:59,176
You... were... right.

443
00:31:00,118 --> 00:31:03,334
Okay. That's two. Hit me.

444
00:31:05,371 --> 00:31:10,152
Those pants don't make you look fat.

445
00:31:11,882 --> 00:31:13,020
Now you got it!

446
00:31:13,338 --> 00:31:15,505
The only three things
a woman needs to hear.

447
00:31:16,503 --> 00:31:19,127
Come on, get up. We got work to do.

448
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:21,104
What's your problem, jumbotron?

449
00:31:21,843 --> 00:31:24,530
Shut up, red... neck... man.

450
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,050
<i>Touché.</i>

451
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:32,200
- What's Jiminy Cricket doing here?
- We need another man.

452
00:31:32,321 --> 00:31:34,536
- Another man for what?
- To push this car, dude.

453
00:31:35,297 --> 00:31:36,686
Push it? Push it where?

454
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:20,183
This is gonna be real good.

455
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,330
So you're going to Australia?

456
00:32:28,914 --> 00:32:30,815
Long way to go
'cause some stupid numbers--

457
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,427
I'd really like you to leave.

458
00:32:34,973 --> 00:32:37,306
When your mom called me
about the lottery,

459
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:39,900
I was on my bike before
she could hang the phone up.

460
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:43,485
I'm getting old.

461
00:32:45,192 --> 00:32:46,896
Yeah, I saw my retirement.

462
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:51,096
You're right.

463
00:32:53,249 --> 00:32:54,526
I'm here for the money.

464
00:32:57,096 --> 00:32:58,756
Well, you're not getting any of it.

465
00:32:58,757 --> 00:33:01,479
Well, that's not why
I'm here talking to you now.

466
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:05,476
I'm here talking to you now
because going to Australia's

467
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:06,912
not gonna break any curse.

468
00:33:08,627 --> 00:33:10,669
You don't need to leave. You just...

469
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:13,635
you need a little hope.

470
00:33:16,307 --> 00:33:17,773
We make our own luck, Hugo.

471
00:33:20,417 --> 00:33:22,150
You know what I think you should do?

472
00:33:22,725 --> 00:33:23,725
What?

473
00:33:25,074 --> 00:33:27,015
I think you should give away the money--

474
00:33:27,675 --> 00:33:29,141
All of it, every penny.

475
00:33:31,689 --> 00:33:34,277
Just save enough for a... a carburetor.

476
00:33:38,037 --> 00:33:41,085
Work on the Camaro,
you know, just you and me.

477
00:33:42,748 --> 00:33:43,970
Take it off the blocks

478
00:33:44,379 --> 00:33:46,546
and make that road trip
to the Grand Canyon.

479
00:33:51,012 --> 00:33:52,845
Never too late for a fresh start.

480
00:34:02,531 --> 00:34:04,586
I'll send you a postcard from Sydney.

481
00:34:11,902 --> 00:34:13,464
I'll be here when you get back.

482
00:34:20,386 --> 00:34:23,396
Are you nuts?
You're not gonna drive down that.

483
00:34:24,991 --> 00:34:26,457
We're gonna jump-start it.

484
00:34:27,881 --> 00:34:30,061
You guys are gonna push it,
and then on the way down,

485
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:31,935
I'm gonna pop the clutch
and get it started.

486
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,209
You see those rocks?

487
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,329
All you're gonna do
is crash into those real fast,

488
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:38,146
if you don't roll over first.

489
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:41,175
- Hurley, no.
- Dudes, I know how to drive.

490
00:34:42,934 --> 00:34:45,525
Now come on. Just push me.
This will work. I know it.

491
00:34:46,687 --> 00:34:48,018
And what are you out here for...

492
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:49,537
Watch him crash and burn?

493
00:34:54,503 --> 00:34:55,780
I came to ride shotgun.

494
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:06,449
Well, it's your funeral.

495
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,290
Come on. Let's give 'em their ride.

496
00:35:13,015 --> 00:35:14,655
Are you sure you want to do this?

497
00:35:17,191 --> 00:35:18,191
Victory or death.

498
00:35:26,796 --> 00:35:27,796
Push!

499
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,898
Careful now!

500
00:35:54,545 --> 00:35:55,545
Here we go!

501
00:36:06,801 --> 00:36:08,615
Now would be a good time, Hurley.

502
00:36:10,047 --> 00:36:11,088
Like right now!

503
00:36:11,143 --> 00:36:13,130
There is no curse.
You make your own luck.

504
00:36:13,943 --> 00:36:16,915
You make your own luck.
There is no curse!

505
00:40:09,486 --> 00:40:12,323
If you were looking for help
to find Jack, why didn't you ask us?

506
00:40:12,749 --> 00:40:15,787
Two reasons-- you don't know
where to look, and you're not motivated.

507
00:40:16,235 --> 00:40:17,457
And I don't blame you.

508
00:40:18,057 --> 00:40:20,459
Why would you want to go
on another trek across the island,

509
00:40:20,497 --> 00:40:22,099
risk more lives just to get Jack back?

510
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:23,742
- You're wrong.
- Oh, really?

511
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,314
Then why didn't you come after--

512
00:40:25,315 --> 00:40:27,983
Not about the motivation,
just about knowing where to look.

513
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,870
We got a compass bearing,

514
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,712
and I'm pretty sure if we follow it,

515
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:33,929
- it'll lead us right to him.
- How?

516
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:36,764
Because of the way
the sunlight hit Mr. Eko's stick

517
00:40:36,803 --> 00:40:38,308
when John was burying him.

518
00:40:41,195 --> 00:40:43,568
So now you know our secret.
How about you tell us yours?

519
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,164
No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot.

520
00:40:48,461 --> 00:40:50,023
It's all right! It's safe!

521
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:52,168
We're just here to talk!

522
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:55,649
You can come out!

523
00:41:21,789 --> 00:41:23,053
What are you doing here?

524
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:26,242
I came to ask for your help.

525
00:41:28,254 --> 00:41:29,254
To do what?

526
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:32,372
I'm heading to the others' camp,

527
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:33,717
and if I'm gonna find it,

528
00:41:33,932 --> 00:41:35,572
I need someone who knows the island.

529
00:41:36,966 --> 00:41:39,372
What makes you think
I have an interest in helping you?

530
00:41:42,386 --> 00:41:43,601
Because they had me,

531
00:41:43,892 --> 00:41:45,427
and they would have never let me go.

532
00:41:45,689 --> 00:41:48,087
They probably would've killed me
if I hadn't escaped.

533
00:41:49,089 --> 00:41:51,787
And the girl who helped me escape...

534
00:41:53,445 --> 00:41:54,945
she was about 16 years old.

535
00:41:58,647 --> 00:42:00,094
And her name was Alex.

536
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:04,879
I'm pretty sure
that she's your daughter.
