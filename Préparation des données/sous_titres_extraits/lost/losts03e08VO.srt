00:00:00,718 --> 00:00:02,287
<i>Previously, on</i> Lost...

2
00:00:09,865 --> 00:00:11,178
Beach camp's right over there.

3
00:00:11,471 --> 00:00:12,727
Can you get me some clothes?

4
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:14,031
What happened to yours?

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,493
I woke up in the jungle like this.

6
00:00:16,691 --> 00:00:17,636
Well, F.Y.I.,

7
00:00:17,938 --> 00:00:19,846
the whole island vibrated,

8
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:21,917
Kate, Jack and Sawyer saw it, too,

9
00:00:22,002 --> 00:00:24,145
right before they had bags
pulled over their heads--

10
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:25,270
Don't worry.

11
00:00:25,847 --> 00:00:27,302
Locke's gonna go after them.

12
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,740
- He said so in his speech.
- What speech?

13
00:00:31,308 --> 00:00:32,811
I'm gonna find our friends.

14
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:35,315
We're gonna find them-- all of them.

15
00:00:36,014 --> 00:00:38,064
I don't know how yet, but I will.

16
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:44,975
You've got a problem with your roof.

17
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:46,619
Roof ?

18
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:07,704
3x08 - Flashes Before Your Eyes

19
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:13,499
Dude, I don't know about this.

20
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:16,608
See, you're looking at this all wrong.

21
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:18,639
He would want us to do this.

22
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,483
He would want us to ransack
is tent and stash?

23
00:01:22,305 --> 00:01:24,057
Yeah, that's sounds exactly like Sawyer.

24
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:25,366
He stole all this.

25
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:26,953
I mean, people need food.

26
00:01:27,218 --> 00:01:29,230
They need medical supplies. They need...

27
00:01:30,468 --> 00:01:32,535
shocking amounts of pornography.

28
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,098
Desmondo!

29
00:01:38,072 --> 00:01:40,245
- I need you to come with me.
- You guys find Eko?

30
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:42,248
Both of you.

31
00:02:08,585 --> 00:02:09,577
What happened?

32
00:02:10,966 --> 00:02:11,968
Eko is dead.

33
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:16,324
We found his body in the jungle...

34
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,242
buried him yesterday.

35
00:02:19,607 --> 00:02:20,618
How did he died?

36
00:02:23,297 --> 00:02:24,535
The island killed him.

37
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:28,267
What do you mean
"the island killed him"?

38
00:02:32,925 --> 00:02:34,579
You know what it means.

39
00:02:35,764 --> 00:02:37,451
With the doctor gone the camp is on edge

40
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,654
enough without people having to worry
about what's out here in the jungle.

41
00:02:41,037 --> 00:02:43,437
They are gonna look to you two.
See how you react.

42
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:46,614
So when I tell everyone what happened,
I need you to...

43
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,695
help keep things calm.

44
00:02:49,838 --> 00:02:50,905
Dude, you okay?

45
00:02:52,927 --> 00:02:53,844
Hey, guys.

46
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,800
What's wrong with Desmond?

47
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:18,196
What is he doing?

48
00:03:25,493 --> 00:03:27,071
There is someone else out there.

49
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:34,536
Where's Claire?

50
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:37,816
Just went for a walk.
I offered to watch the baby.

51
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,273
- I've got her.
- Is she okay?

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,390
- What happened?
- Stand back. just give me some room!

53
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:04,060
Get back Charlie, I know what I'm doing.

54
00:04:04,155 --> 00:04:05,808
Is she breathing? She's not breathing?

55
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:15,897
Do you want me to help you?

56
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,656
You all right?

57
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,882
Cough it up.

58
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,319
It's all right, Charlie.

59
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:33,087
- Okay, let's get her back to the tent.
- Is she okay?

60
00:04:33,238 --> 00:04:35,525
- Let me help.
- I've got her, Charlie.

61
00:04:37,688 --> 00:04:38,813
Where are you going?

62
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:40,858
Hey, how did he know?

63
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,373
How did he know she was drowning?

64
00:04:46,737 --> 00:04:48,164
I'll tell you how he knew.

65
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:51,376
That guy...

66
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:54,154
sees the future, dude.

68
00:05:29,276 --> 00:05:30,432
She's beautifull.

69
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,003
Aye.

70
00:05:34,804 --> 00:05:35,807
Thanks.

71
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:38,871
- What's her name?
- Penny...

72
00:05:40,728 --> 00:05:41,825
Penelop.

73
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,297
How are you feeling?

74
00:05:47,358 --> 00:05:48,986
Still a little shaken up.

75
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,934
I go to swimming almost every day and...

76
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,270
the undertow just grabbed me.

77
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,699
You know, if you hadn't...

78
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:03,306
I thought you were only gonna be
five minutes. Aaron's starving.

79
00:06:03,428 --> 00:06:05,299
Yeah, um...sorry.

80
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:12,312
Anyway, I just really wanted to say...

81
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,707
thank you.

82
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:16,789
Thank you so much...

83
00:06:18,016 --> 00:06:19,017
for being there.

84
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,527
It was my pleasure.

85
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,840
Locke doesn't know about anything
except knives and fishing.

86
00:06:32,999 --> 00:06:36,274
There's nothing to know. I don't buy
this precognitive insanity rubbish.

87
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:38,550
Look, if the bearded wonder
could predict the future,

88
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,871
he wouldn't have ended up here,
would he?

89
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:45,768
Well, whatever happened to him,
we're gonna have to find out what it is.

90
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:49,549
You do realize he's gonna know your plan
before you even come up with it, dude.

91
00:06:49,672 --> 00:06:50,950
In that case...

92
00:06:52,650 --> 00:06:55,483
we're gonna have
to get him really bloody drunk.

93
00:07:08,188 --> 00:07:09,360
Beautiful evening.

94
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:12,940
Aye

95
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:15,660
Say it, dude.

96
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,526
This morning...

97
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,770
I'm sorry I wasn't more... grateful.

98
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:26,979
Thank you for helping Claire not drown.

99
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,805
No harm done.

100
00:07:31,087 --> 00:07:32,098
Excellent.

101
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,896
Brought a peace offering.

102
00:07:35,509 --> 00:07:37,286
You know, make the truce official.

103
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,061
Thanks, but no.

104
00:07:40,929 --> 00:07:43,860
I've spent a wee bit too much time drunk
as of late.

105
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,730
Too good for us, brother.

106
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,692
All right, that's fine.

107
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,677
We'll take our drink
and go somewhere else.

108
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:57,197
What kind of whiskey is that?

109
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,595
It's, uh... just says "Maccutcheon".

110
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,075
All right, then.

111
00:08:15,378 --> 00:08:16,408
Let's have it.

112
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:19,807
No, the bottle, brother.

113
00:08:20,294 --> 00:08:22,515
I mean,
if you've come to drink, let's drink.

114
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,589
Hey, let's drink.

115
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,152
Are all your songs about

116
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:04,788
drinking and fighting
and girls with one leg?

117
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:08,416
Well...
girls with one leg and a heart of gold.

118
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:18,970
So, Dezzie...

119
00:09:21,162 --> 00:09:22,408
let me ask you something.

120
00:09:22,746 --> 00:09:23,823
Anything, pal.

121
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,178
How'd you know Claire was drowning?

122
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:33,037
I could hear her calling for help.

123
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,488
Uh, no, you didn't.

124
00:09:36,347 --> 00:09:37,981
You were, like, a mile away.

125
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,114
Well, I suppose I...

126
00:09:43,664 --> 00:09:45,061
I've got good hearing.

127
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:50,606
You...

128
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,679
hear the lightning as well?

129
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,950
Excuse me?

130
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,249
The lightning.

131
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,830
Just by chance, you pitched
your little rod outside Claire's tent,

132
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:05,840
and two hours later, lightning strikes.

133
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,375
Thanks for the drink, pal.

134
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,825
I don't know what you're doing.

135
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,223
You'd best tell us.

136
00:10:23,367 --> 00:10:26,099
You think because you turned some key,
that makes you a hero?

137
00:10:26,269 --> 00:10:27,686
You're no hero, brother.

138
00:10:27,991 --> 00:10:29,433
I don't know how you're doing

139
00:10:29,499 --> 00:10:31,650
but I know a coward when I see one.

140
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:38,028
You don't want to know what happened
to me when I turned that key!

141
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,550
You don't want to know--

142
00:10:39,705 --> 00:10:41,500
- You don't want to know!
- Get him off!

143
00:10:56,637 --> 00:10:57,639
Wait!

144
00:10:58,442 --> 00:11:00,568
I'll see you in another life, brother.

145
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,736
I love you, Penny.

146
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,913
My god.

147
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,481
Des, are you all right?

148
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:46,230
Stay there. Hang on.

149
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,050
I'm just getting ice.

150
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,108
Are you all right?

151
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,750
- Sweetie, you okay?
- What's happening?

152
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,380
Well, what's happening
is the result of combining ladders,

153
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,269
painting the ceiling and alcohol.

154
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:05,030
Are you okay? Are you nauseous?

155
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,075
This is my flat.

156
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:11,330
Although if you want me
to feel at home here,

157
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:13,475
you might startcalling it our flat.

158
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,748
How many fingers, Des?

159
00:12:19,935 --> 00:12:20,965
Love, look at me.

160
00:12:21,721 --> 00:12:22,770
What's wrong?

161
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,501
Absolutely nothing.

162
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,315
Here.

163
00:13:01,932 --> 00:13:02,949
Let me.

164
00:13:04,414 --> 00:13:06,105
- Thanks.
- Hang on.

165
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,254
You've got paint on your neck.

166
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:14,639
How's that concussion?

167
00:13:15,049 --> 00:13:16,053
Well, my...

168
00:13:16,592 --> 00:13:20,490
severe head injury is a small price to
pay for the pleasure of having...

169
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,370
you move into my humble...

170
00:13:24,184 --> 00:13:25,214
is...

171
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,306
"rat trap" accurate?

172
00:13:36,602 --> 00:13:37,638
<i>Voilà.</i>

173
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:43,150
You know you don't really need a job
from my father, Des.

174
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,598
It's not about the job.

175
00:13:45,174 --> 00:13:46,629
I want him to respect me.

176
00:13:47,212 --> 00:13:48,968
Then respect you he shall.

177
00:13:49,973 --> 00:13:52,715
But if for some reason he's too daft
to see how brilliant you are,

178
00:13:52,771 --> 00:13:54,960
it's not the end of the world.

179
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,818
What did you say?

180
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,772
Here you go, luv.

181
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:19,800
You all right?

182
00:14:19,988 --> 00:14:21,749
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

183
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:22,848
Just...

184
00:14:24,059 --> 00:14:26,820
Just had a bit of a déjà vu, that's all.

185
00:14:38,424 --> 00:14:39,550
Good afternoon.

186
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,730
I'm here to see mr. Widmore.

187
00:14:42,871 --> 00:14:46,477
- And you are?
- Hume, Mr. Desmond Hume.

188
00:14:47,397 --> 00:14:48,970
Hello, luv.

189
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,750
Got a parcel here for 8-15.

190
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:55,038
Excuse me.

191
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,076
What did you say?

192
00:14:57,311 --> 00:15:01,370
I said, "delivery for 8-15".

193
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,185
Mr. Hume?

194
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:08,950
Mr.Widmore is ready for you.

195
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:12,814
Thank you.

196
00:15:20,226 --> 00:15:22,760
Penny didn't tell me
you were an actor, Desmond.

197
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:26,818
No, it's actually set design
for the Royal Shakespeare Company.

198
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:28,078
Impressive.

199
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,034
You didn't graduate from university.

200
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,376
No, Sir.

201
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,083
I had to look after my 3 brothers

202
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:36,550
- after my father--
- Any military experience?

203
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,171
No, Sir.

204
00:15:44,252 --> 00:15:45,396
She's beautiful...

205
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,020
your boat.

206
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,610
My foundation is sponsoring
a solo race around the world.

207
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,590
Something wrong?

208
00:16:00,789 --> 00:16:01,870
No, Sir.

209
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,379
Well, Desmond, I'm going to see to it

210
00:16:05,435 --> 00:16:08,619
that you have a position
in our administrative department.

211
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:12,100
Not the most glamorous duty,
but it's a start.

212
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:16,870
- I'll speak to human resources.
- With all due respect, Sir...

213
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:20,483
I haven't come here to...

214
00:16:20,652 --> 00:16:22,890
interview for
a position in your company.

215
00:16:23,710 --> 00:16:25,634
- You haven't?
- No, Sir.

216
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:31,453
I came here to ask
for your daughter's hand in marriage.

217
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,730
We've been together
two years now, and...

218
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,425
Pen's moving in...

219
00:16:39,716 --> 00:16:41,107
and...

220
00:16:41,795 --> 00:16:42,796
I love her.

221
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,530
Your permission would
mean everything to me.

222
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:51,630
I'm impressed, Hume.

223
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,930
Very noble gesture.

224
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,849
- You know anything about whiskey?
- No,I'm afraid not, Sir.

225
00:17:04,853 --> 00:17:09,055
This is a 60-year MacCutcheon,
named after Anderson MacCutcheon,

226
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,599
esteemed admiral from the Royal Navy.

227
00:17:11,721 --> 00:17:13,552
He retired

228
00:17:14,351 --> 00:17:17,550
with more medals
than any man before or since,

229
00:17:17,706 --> 00:17:20,660
moved to the Highlands
to see out his remaining years.

230
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,580
Admiral MacCutcheon
was a great man, Hume.

231
00:17:24,670 --> 00:17:26,780
This was his crowning achievement.

232
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,702
This swallow

233
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:38,380
is worth more
than you could make in a month.

234
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,452
And to share it with you
would be a waste

235
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,714
and a disgrace
to the great man who made it,

236
00:17:52,635 --> 00:17:54,846
because you, Hume,

237
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:57,130
will never be a great man.

238
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,322
Mr. Widmore...

239
00:18:07,425 --> 00:18:10,030
- I know I'm not--
- What you're not...

240
00:18:10,383 --> 00:18:12,850
is worthy of drinking my whiskey.

241
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,432
How could you ever be
worthy of my daughter?

242
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:11,290
Thank you very much. A fiver!
Thank you very much.

243
00:19:11,571 --> 00:19:13,346
- I know you.
- That's fine. See you later.

244
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:16,200
- How do I know you?
- You can leave your number if you want.

245
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,840
How do I know you?

246
00:19:18,136 --> 00:19:19,470
I don't...

247
00:19:20,405 --> 00:19:22,527
- Where do I know you from?
- Look,

248
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:25,400
I don't know, but I'll remember
if I could get some help.

249
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:30,843
Hey, can I get some help?

250
00:19:32,073 --> 00:19:33,369
You're Charlie.

251
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:36,110
Yeah, name's on the sign.

252
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,870
<i>System failure.</i>

253
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,770
- No...
- Thanks a lot.

254
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,160
The... It was in the hatch.

255
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,790
I remember seeing you. There was a...

256
00:19:49,184 --> 00:19:51,450
There was a computer,
there was a button. We...

257
00:19:53,294 --> 00:19:55,153
We were on an island.

258
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:57,010
We are on an island, mate.
This is England.

259
00:19:57,066 --> 00:19:59,770
- No, it was real, man, I remember!
- Hey, all right.

260
00:19:59,827 --> 00:20:01,798
This is why we don't do drugs.

261
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:05,140
No, this... I remember this.
This all happened before.

262
00:20:05,286 --> 00:20:06,976
Today...

263
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:09,796
This happened today. This...

264
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,596
I remember that he said I wasn't worthy,

265
00:20:13,662 --> 00:20:16,930
and then I came down
and I took off my tie,

266
00:20:17,042 --> 00:20:20,200
and then I lost my tie,
and Penny said, "where was it"?

267
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:21,820
And then it started to rain!

268
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:35,960
Your thesis is a bit neat.

269
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:38,148
The wild card, Partridge,
is unpredictability.

270
00:20:38,187 --> 00:20:40,870
Run the same test ten times,
you'll get ten different outcomes.

271
00:20:40,889 --> 00:20:42,449
That's what makes life so wonderfully--

272
00:20:42,488 --> 00:20:44,724
- Donovan!
- Case in point.

273
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:48,200
Who could have known that a drenched
Scotsman would appear in this rotunda?

274
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:53,330
- You've looked better. Not much, but...
- I need to ask you something.

275
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,043
By all means, do.

276
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,717
What do you know about time travel?

277
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,365
Are you bloody insane?

278
00:21:13,399 --> 00:21:15,037
Just tell me if it's possible.

279
00:21:15,114 --> 00:21:16,212
Which part?

280
00:21:16,346 --> 00:21:18,022
The island full of mysterious hatches,

281
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,450
or the computer
which keeps the world from ending?

282
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,647
Forget you're my best mate, all right?

283
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:27,692
As a physicist, is it possible
that I've somehow managed to

284
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:32,243
go back in time and
am now living my life over again?

285
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:36,384
It's not funny, Donovan.

286
00:21:36,911 --> 00:21:39,261
Penny's father berates you
for not being a great man,

287
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:42,913
and voilà, you've dreamed a future where
you push a buttonto save the world.

288
00:21:42,952 --> 00:21:45,013
These things are not in my head,
brother.

289
00:21:46,415 --> 00:21:48,013
I remember things.

290
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:50,014
All right, then.

291
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,034
What happens next?

292
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,371
It doesn't work like that.

293
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,737
I don't remember everything, just...

294
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,012
just bits and pieces.

295
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,117
How wonderfully convenient.

296
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,095
I remember this.

297
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:18,374
I know this song.

298
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,404
The jukebox...

299
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:25,593
Des, you're worrying me now.

300
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,900
I remember this night.

301
00:22:30,755 --> 00:22:32,597
Graybridge comes back
from two goals down in

302
00:22:32,616 --> 00:22:35,183
the final two minutes to win this game.
It's a bloody miracle!

303
00:22:35,936 --> 00:22:38,448
And right after they win,
Jimmy Lennon's gonna come through

304
00:22:38,505 --> 00:22:41,382
that door and hit the bartender
right in the head with a cricket bat,

305
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,422
'cause he owes him money.

306
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,940
- Seriously, Des-
- Watch, please.

307
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,662
Just watch.

308
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,662
He'll score the first goal right now.

309
00:22:52,893 --> 00:22:54,472
<i>Brilliant save by...</i>

310
00:22:55,661 --> 00:22:56,672
They came back.

311
00:22:57,011 --> 00:22:58,439
They--they won.

312
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,111
Jimmy Lennon, cricket bat.

313
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:13,400
There's no such thing
as time travel, Des.

314
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,301
And from what I understand,
true love can be just as unlikely.

315
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:25,601
So,

316
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,219
if you love Penny,

317
00:23:27,831 --> 00:23:30,434
stop messing about and marry her.

318
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:10,224
You smell like the pub.

319
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,580
That's because I was at the pub.

320
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,284
You didn't get the job.

321
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,317
What did my father say?

322
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:25,783
Your father... was lovely.

323
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,405
We just both agreed that I wasn't...

324
00:24:30,825 --> 00:24:32,053
exactly qualified.

325
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,980
I say we celebrate.

326
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,260
I say we celebrate that fate
has spared you a miserable existence

327
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,660
under the employ of Widmore industries.

328
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,327
Let me take you out tomorrow.

329
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:44,400
Let's go for lobsters on the pier,
my treat.

330
00:24:44,448 --> 00:24:46,933
I don't think my failure
to impress your father is any

331
00:24:47,414 --> 00:24:48,628
occasion to celebrate.

332
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:50,342
Well, the occasion is I love you.

333
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,938
Why?

334
00:24:58,670 --> 00:24:59,977
Why do you love me?

335
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,079
'Cause you're a good man.

336
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,465
In my experience,
they're pretty hard to come by.

337
00:25:22,914 --> 00:25:24,166
Where are you?

338
00:25:26,781 --> 00:25:28,110
I'm right here.

339
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,389
Never done this before, have you?

340
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,579
Is it that obvious?

341
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:49,322
I can always tell the first-timers.

342
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,285
Now then, may I ask your price range?

343
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,385
I'm not a man of means.

344
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,778
I hope to, you know, one day...

345
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,133
I have just the thing.

346
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:17,367
This won't blind any queens,
to be sure, but still,

347
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,446
it has the sparkle of life.

348
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:30,230
I'll take it.

349
00:26:30,416 --> 00:26:31,700
I'm... sorry?

350
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,447
It's perfect. I'll take it.

351
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,221
No, you won't.

352
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,686
Give me the ring. Give it here.

353
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,785
I don't understand.

354
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:45,744
This is wrong. You don't buy the ring.

355
00:26:46,341 --> 00:26:48,972
You--you have second thoughts.
You walk right out that door.

356
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,541
So come on. Let's have it.

357
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:55,030
I don't know what you're on about.

358
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,364
You don't buy the ring, Desmond.

359
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,125
How do you know my name?

360
00:27:03,181 --> 00:27:06,976
I know your name as well as I know
that you don't ask Penny to marry you.

361
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,762
In fact, you break her heart.

362
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,370
Well, breaking her heart, of course,

363
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:13,430
is what drives you
in a few short years from now

364
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,291
to enter that sailing race
to prove her father wrong,

365
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,879
which brings you to the island
where you spend the next three years

366
00:27:19,956 --> 00:27:22,813
of your life entering numbers
into the computer,

367
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,650
until you are forced
to turn that fail-safe key.

368
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:33,300
And if you don't do those things,
Desmond David Hume,

369
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,846
every single one of us is dead.

370
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:43,186
So give me that sodding ring.

371
00:27:52,394 --> 00:27:55,000
You're going to be difficult
about this, I can see.

372
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,270
Who are you?

373
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:00,429
Do you like chestnuts?

374
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,202
What?

375
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,401
Thank you.

376
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:15,860
That man over there
is wearing red shoes.

377
00:28:19,058 --> 00:28:20,984
So? What, then?

378
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:25,489
Just thought it was a bold
fashion choice worth noting.

379
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,800
This isn't really happening, is it?

380
00:28:33,872 --> 00:28:35,240
Sorry?

381
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:40,609
I've had a concussion.

382
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,160
You're my subconscious.

383
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,338
Am I?

384
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:49,477
You're here to...

385
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,778
to talk me out of marrying Penny.

386
00:28:53,534 --> 00:28:55,180
Well, it won't bloody work.

387
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,999
Oh, yes, it will.

388
00:28:58,286 --> 00:29:00,520
There is no island.
There is no button.

389
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,993
It's madness.
I love her. She loves me.

390
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,768
I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life with her.

391
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,303
No, Desmond...

392
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,919
You knew that was gonna happen,
didn't you?

393
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:33,380
Then why didn't youstop it?
Why didn't you do anything?

394
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,383
Because it wouldn't matter.

395
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,032
Had I warned himabout the scaffolding,

396
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,940
tomorrow he'd be hit by a taxi.

397
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,747
If I warned himabout the taxi,

398
00:29:45,883 --> 00:29:48,350
he'd fall in the shower
and break his neck.

399
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:53,120
The universe, unfortunately,
has a way of...

400
00:29:53,556 --> 00:29:55,174
course-correcting.

401
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,705
That man was supposed to die.

402
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,894
That was his path.

403
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:09,625
Just as it's your path
to go to the island.

404
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,980
You don't do it
because you choose to, Desmond,

405
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,905
you do it because you're supposed to.

406
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,247
I'm gonna meet Penny in an hour.

407
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:27,560
I've got the ring.

408
00:30:28,114 --> 00:30:29,540
She'll say yes.

409
00:30:30,348 --> 00:30:32,197
I can choose whatever I want.

410
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:38,576
You may not like your path, Desmond,

411
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:45,459
but pushing that button is the only
truly great thing that you will ever do.

412
00:30:55,706 --> 00:30:57,208
How much for the ring?

413
00:31:47,717 --> 00:31:49,277
- Am I late?
- Right on time.

414
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,366
Take your photo, lovebirds?

415
00:31:53,424 --> 00:31:54,522
No, thanks, mate.

416
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,820
Come on, something
to show the grandkids.

417
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,389
Come on, Des, let's do it
for all those grandkids.

418
00:31:59,664 --> 00:32:01,224
You'll do it?
All righty.

419
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,862
Let's see what we got for you here, eh?

420
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,117
Ah, a beautiful desert scene.

421
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,140
No, not the desert?
All right.

422
00:32:08,532 --> 00:32:09,871
I know. The Alps.

423
00:32:10,425 --> 00:32:11,459
I love the Alps.

424
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,519
I hate the Alps.

425
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,948
Yeah, not the alps.

426
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,570
Here we go.
Beautiful marina scene.

427
00:32:17,777 --> 00:32:19,815
- Yeah, let's do that.
- It's the one, isn't it?

428
00:32:21,111 --> 00:32:22,113
All right.

429
00:32:23,259 --> 00:32:26,091
Take your coat off. It's boiling.
There's palm trees.

430
00:32:26,127 --> 00:32:27,160
Here we go.

431
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:33,325
An instant classic.

432
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,346
- Only 5 quid.
- Here we go, luv.

433
00:32:38,131 --> 00:32:39,287
Here you go, mate.

434
00:32:41,102 --> 00:32:42,354
Out of 20.

435
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,627
You're a lovely couple.

436
00:32:44,706 --> 00:32:46,979
Small price to pay
for the memories, right?

437
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,232
I couldn't go through with it.

438
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,745
What was that?

439
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,874
I can't do this.

440
00:33:08,011 --> 00:33:09,205
You can't do what?

441
00:33:10,148 --> 00:33:11,323
Us.

442
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:15,649
This...

443
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:18,402
This relationship.

444
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,873
What are you talking about?

445
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:25,530
How can I?

446
00:33:27,726 --> 00:33:29,941
I can't look after you.

447
00:33:30,268 --> 00:33:32,310
I haven't got a job.
I don't have any...

448
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:35,811
I can't even afford 5
quid for a bloody photograph.

449
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:39,739
You deserve someone better.

450
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,089
I know what I deserve.
I chose to be with you. I love you.

451
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:46,385
Love's not enough.
Being a good man is not enough.

452
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,104
What's this about, Des?
Where's this coming from?

453
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:52,379
It's all happening too soon--
you moving in,

454
00:33:53,477 --> 00:33:55,347
you're painting rooms,
you're changing things.

455
00:33:55,405 --> 00:33:56,799
I don't even like red.

456
00:33:57,446 --> 00:33:59,746
And why would you leave your flat--
your expensive flat--

457
00:33:59,765 --> 00:34:01,158
Don't do that.

458
00:34:01,671 --> 00:34:05,388
Don't you pretend you don't care,
and don't you dare rewrite history.

459
00:34:05,427 --> 00:34:09,139
I left my expensive flat 'cause you
were too proud to live there, remember?

460
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,276
If you want me to go,
if you want me to leave,

461
00:34:15,385 --> 00:34:20,278
then don't make this about
what I do or don't deserve...

462
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,652
and have the decency to admit

463
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,727
that you're doing this
because you're a coward.

464
00:34:33,274 --> 00:34:34,371
I'm sorry.

465
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:37,800
But this...

466
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:49,228
we're not supposed to be together.

467
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,869
What'll it be?

468
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:30,649
Just give me a pint of your cheapest.

469
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,444
I'm celebratin'.

470
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,501
What's the occasion?

471
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:40,085
I think I've made
the biggest mistake of my life,

472
00:35:41,648 --> 00:35:42,861
and the worst part is...

473
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:46,357
I'm pretty sure I've made it before.

474
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,721
That's what they call déjà vu, mate.

475
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:50,799
Do they now?

476
00:36:14,386 --> 00:36:15,792
I had the wrong night.

477
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,552
I was right.

478
00:36:18,248 --> 00:36:20,617
I was off by a night.
I heard the song, and then...

479
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:21,915
I remember this.

480
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,443
I'm not crazy!

481
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:25,894
I can still change things.

482
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,364
I can still change it.

483
00:36:31,029 --> 00:36:32,289
Jimmy Lennon.

484
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,223
Where the hell's my money?

485
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,882
Hey, duck, brother!

486
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,525
Please...

487
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:09,023
let me go back.

488
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,589
Let me go back one more time.

489
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:16,156
I'll do it right.
I'll do it right this time.

490
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,690
I'm sorry, Penny.

491
00:38:23,798 --> 00:38:25,031
I'll change it.

492
00:38:27,198 --> 00:38:28,411
I'll change it.

493
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,133
How'd you know Claire was drowning?

494
00:38:35,209 --> 00:38:37,058
Well, I could hear her calling for help.

495
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,884
You, uh, hear the lightning as well?

496
00:38:42,770 --> 00:38:46,250
Just by chance, you pitched
your little rod outside Claire's tent,

497
00:38:46,690 --> 00:38:48,795
and two hours later, lightning strikes.

498
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,708
I don't know how you're doing
what it is you're doing,

499
00:38:57,766 --> 00:38:59,440
but I know a coward when I see one.

500
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,948
Yeah, a coward--

501
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:06,709
You don't want to know what happened
to me when I turned that key!

502
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:08,430
- Get off!
- You don't want to know!

503
00:39:08,642 --> 00:39:10,953
You don't want to know
what happened to me.

504
00:39:11,347 --> 00:39:12,792
You don't want to know!

505
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:19,994
- It doesn't matter what you do.
- What the hell are you doing?

506
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,473
You can't change it.

507
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,680
No matter what you try to do,
you just can't change it.

508
00:39:32,109 --> 00:39:34,863
He's wankered.
Let's get him to his tent.

509
00:39:36,339 --> 00:39:38,361
All right, Des, come on.
Give me your arm.

510
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,658
Come on. Stand up. Stand up!

511
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,407
You're a good man, Charlie.

512
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,839
Listen, I'm sorry I tried
to strangle you, all right?

513
00:39:53,398 --> 00:39:54,727
Fair play, mate. Here we go.

514
00:39:59,394 --> 00:40:00,877
Sorry I called you a coward.

515
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,358
Ah, you're all right, pal.

516
00:40:09,548 --> 00:40:11,590
You are gonna tell me
what happened to you.

517
00:40:19,970 --> 00:40:21,394
When I turned that key...

518
00:40:26,261 --> 00:40:27,533
my life...

519
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,557
flashed before my eyes,

520
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:35,461
and then I was back in the jungle,

521
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,924
still on this bloody island.

522
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,699
But those flashes, Charlie...

523
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:46,389
those flashes--
they didn't stop.

524
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,197
So...

525
00:40:49,908 --> 00:40:54,290
you're telling me you saw a flash
of Claire drowning this morning?

526
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,242
That's how you knew how to save her?

527
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,669
I wasn't saving Claire, Charlie.

528
00:41:01,305 --> 00:41:02,518
I was saving you.

529
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,107
This morning, you dove in after Claire.

530
00:41:13,349 --> 00:41:14,910
You tried to save her, but...

531
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:21,214
you drowned.

532
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:24,735
What are you talking about?

533
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,492
I didn't drown.

534
00:41:27,202 --> 00:41:29,398
When I saw the lightninghit the roof,

535
00:41:30,612 --> 00:41:31,844
you were electrocuted.

536
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:36,405
And when you heard
Claire was in the water, you...

537
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,377
you drowned trying to save her.

538
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,389
I dove in myself,
so you never went in.

539
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:46,697
I've tried, brother.
I've tried twice to save you, but...

540
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:51,430
the universe has a way
of course-correcting,

541
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:53,860
and I can't stop it forever.

542
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:00,188
I'm sorry. I'm sorry because...

543
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:05,956
no matter what I try to do...

544
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,535
you're gonna die, Charlie.
