1
00:00:00,695 --> 00:00:02,642
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:09,117 --> 00:00:11,967
- Are you sure you really want--
- I've made my choice.

3
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,901
- Where did it come from?
- Based on the maps inside, Nigeria.

4
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:24,079
- Anyone on board?
- Two men dressed as priests.

5
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:27,447
- Priests?
- Drug runners in disguise.

6
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,042
The plane was
loaded with heroin.

7
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,614


8
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,189


9
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,054


10
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,449


11
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,137


12
00:02:00,335 --> 00:02:02,092


13
00:02:04,654 --> 00:02:09,279


14
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:15,570
No! No! No!

15
00:02:15,738 --> 00:02:17,111
Let him go!

16
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:29,783
Kill him.

17
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,765
Shoot him... now.

18
00:02:38,689 --> 00:02:40,061
Shoot him!

19
00:02:40,902 --> 00:02:42,039
Do it!

20
00:02:58,713 --> 00:03:00,466
What's your name, boy?

21
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,467
What's your name, boy?

22
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,774
Eko.

23
00:03:11,327 --> 00:03:12,987
Look at Mr. Eko.

24
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:14,544
No hesitation.

25
00:03:15,822 --> 00:03:17,051
A born killer.

26
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:21,788
Come.

27
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:25,967
You won't need that anymore.

28
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,166
Back!

29
00:03:28,306 --> 00:03:30,014
Back we go, back we go.

30
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,996
What are you writing?

31
00:04:02,131 --> 00:04:04,123
Things I need to remember.

32
00:04:05,524 --> 00:04:07,565
Do you mind if I sit?

33
00:04:08,011 --> 00:04:09,480
Please.

34
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:10,801
Thanks.

35
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:16,691
So you're Eko, huh?

36
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,963
- Yes.
- Claire.

37
00:04:19,896 --> 00:04:21,890
And this is Aaron.

38
00:04:22,357 --> 00:04:25,924
Aaron? The brother of Moses.

39
00:04:26,202 --> 00:04:29,578
Yeah, that must have been
tough to live up to, right?

40
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:31,071
Pressure of everyone saying,

41
00:04:31,137 --> 00:04:33,656
"why can't you be more
like your brother Moses?"

42
00:04:33,796 --> 00:04:37,125
Yes, I'm sure it was.

43
00:04:39,085 --> 00:04:41,605
Why did you choose it--

44
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:43,165
Aaron?

45
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:47,956
I just liked it.

46
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,751
Aaron was a great man.

47
00:04:56,822 --> 00:05:03,920
Moses had great difficulty speaking,
so it was Aaron who spoke for him.

48
00:05:06,352 --> 00:05:08,532
So you're religious, huh?

49
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,974
You should speak to Charlie.

50
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,153
He doesn't want to
admit he's religious,

51
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:18,387
but he carries around a
statue of the Virgin Mary.

52
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:21,718
A statue?

53
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:26,714
Yeah. He says he found it on the island.
Weird, right?

54
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,999
May I see it?

55
00:05:37,611 --> 00:05:39,463
Where did he find this?

56
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:41,208
He said he found
it in the jungle.

57
00:05:41,238 --> 00:05:42,564
Where in the jungle?

58
00:05:42,703 --> 00:05:44,175
- I don't know.
- Where?

59
00:05:44,265 --> 00:05:47,360
Look, what are...
it's just a statue.

60
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:48,773
Just a statue?

61
00:06:02,416 --> 00:06:04,503
Where is Charlie?

62
00:06:36,497 --> 00:06:38,681
You breakin' in
or breakin' out?

63
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:43,322
I used to love those old silent
movies where the robbers would

64
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:47,253
crack a combination lock with
their ear pressed up against a safe

65
00:06:47,347 --> 00:06:52,154
and the money they stole was always in a
white bag with a big dollar sign on it.

66
00:06:52,248 --> 00:06:56,004
Silent movies, huh?
You're not that old, man.

67
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:58,137
Well, I'm old enough.

68
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,603
Settin' the combination?

69
00:06:59,696 --> 00:07:03,804
With the new folks joining us, I figure
we better limit people's access to
the guns.

70
00:07:03,834 --> 00:07:07,925
Can't have just anyone who wants one
walking in and helping themselves,

71
00:07:08,111 --> 00:07:11,922
which I'm guessin' is
why you're here, Michael.

72
00:07:27,561 --> 00:07:31,559
Hey, Jin,
do you like the kinks? Kinks?

73
00:07:31,649 --> 00:07:34,168
- Keens?
- No, no. Kinks.

74
00:07:34,214 --> 00:07:38,164
Kinds with a "k" at the end.
K-k-kink-kuh. K-kinks. You don't...

75
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:43,569
It's a good tune, Jin.

76
00:07:46,931 --> 00:07:50,933
Oh, thank you very much, Jin.
I do have a beautiful voice, don't I?

77
00:07:58,258 --> 00:07:59,727
Where did you find this?

78
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,097
- What--what happened?
- Where did you find it?

79
00:08:02,329 --> 00:08:03,841
In the jungle.
I found it in the jungle.

80
00:08:03,871 --> 00:08:07,057
Take me there.
This is not your business.

81
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,016
I want you to take me
to where you found it.

82
00:08:09,046 --> 00:08:11,897
Okay, fine.
Yeah, we'll go for a stroll.

83
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,089
There's nothing there.

84
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:14,555
We'll go first thing
in the morning, okay?

85
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:16,435
We're going now.

86
00:08:17,042 --> 00:08:21,430
Okay. Let me go tell Claire so she
doesn't get the wrong idea. Wait
here. I--

87
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:22,967
Tell her on your way.

88
00:09:00,757 --> 00:09:03,181
Get us some beers. Go.

89
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,673
- Where did you find this?
- What does it matter?

90
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:20,331
- The same in the other bag?
- Yes.

91
00:09:36,396 --> 00:09:37,545
50.

92
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:40,434
50 what?

93
00:09:42,161 --> 00:09:47,489
50  is what I will pay you in exchange
for the favor you are asking me to do.

94
00:09:47,768 --> 00:09:48,999
A favor?

95
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,191
You have a large
quantity of heroin

96
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:55,076
in a country that has no poppies
and no market for its sale.

97
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:59,119
Your drugs are of no value here,
so you must get them out.

98
00:09:59,209 --> 00:10:01,978
The borders are all
guarded by the military,

99
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:03,955
so you must fly,

100
00:10:04,056 --> 00:10:06,234
but as I am sure you are aware,

101
00:10:06,325 --> 00:10:09,940
the only private planes
currently allowed into the air

102
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,707
are either U.N.
Aid or the catholic missionaries,

103
00:10:14,835 --> 00:10:18,459
and so you have come
to me for a favor.

104
00:10:19,755 --> 00:10:25,899
I will buy your heroin for 50.

105
00:10:39,444 --> 00:10:42,104
It is true what
they say about you.

106
00:10:42,196 --> 00:10:44,103
And what is that?

107
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,084
You have no soul.

108
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:54,918
No.

109
00:11:00,056 --> 00:11:00,716
Go.

110
00:11:03,467 --> 00:11:04,220
Go...

111
00:11:06,513 --> 00:11:08,883
and tell your friends
I let you live...

112
00:11:09,396 --> 00:11:12,867
that Mr. Eko let you live.

113
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:23,496
Just give me a second, okay?

114
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:31,493
Hi... Claire.

115
00:11:32,893 --> 00:11:34,293
What happened to the statue?

116
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,303
Oh, don't play stupid, Charlie.

117
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:37,577
W hat?

118
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:39,838
What's this?

119
00:11:40,305 --> 00:11:42,727
Because this was in
your little statue,

120
00:11:42,866 --> 00:11:47,578
and unless I'm mistaken, I seem to
remember you saying you were a
drug addict.

121
00:11:53,556 --> 00:11:54,786
I didn't know.

122
00:11:55,953 --> 00:11:59,519
Look, if it's sealed up inside a statue,
how would I know?

123
00:12:01,153 --> 00:12:04,434
Claire, I'm not using.

124
00:12:06,488 --> 00:12:11,742
Look. You believe me now?
I don't... care.

125
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,353
Someone's waiting for you.

126
00:12:27,644 --> 00:12:28,293
Got it?

127
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,330
- Got it.
- All right.

128
00:12:31,353 --> 00:12:37,879
Breath halfway out, and gently
squeeze the trigger. Squeeze...

129
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:40,205
Good.

130
00:12:40,902 --> 00:12:42,470
How'd you learn all this stuff?

131
00:12:44,194 --> 00:12:46,378
My dad used to take me hunting.

132
00:12:46,518 --> 00:12:47,747
Huntin' for what?

133
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:48,976
Birds, mostly.

134
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:53,973
Of course,
birds don't shoot back.

135
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:55,845
Yeah.

136
00:12:57,803 --> 00:12:59,230
I know people are talking,

137
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,622
thinkin' I'm gonna go
runnin' off after Walt again.

138
00:13:01,652 --> 00:13:04,137
If people are talkin',
I'm not hearing it,

139
00:13:04,279 --> 00:13:07,518
but if I was,
I'd say it's not a very smart plan.

140
00:13:07,662 --> 00:13:08,928
Yeah, it's not.

141
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:13,392
Let's try one for real.

142
00:13:28,756 --> 00:13:29,605
Bravo.

143
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:37,302
Well done with Claire, mate.

144
00:13:37,481 --> 00:13:41,817
You got me in a lot of trouble there,
so thanks for that. I hope you're happy.

145
00:13:42,095 --> 00:13:44,652
Oh, that's right,
you don't do happy.

146
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:51,659
All right, well, we're here.

147
00:13:52,076 --> 00:13:54,304
I found it right here,
right by that tree.

148
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:59,794
-  You found it here?
- Yeah. Found it here.

149
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,035
You're a liar.

150
00:14:06,354 --> 00:14:07,492
Know what?

151
00:14:07,632 --> 00:14:09,065
I don't even know you.

152
00:14:09,205 --> 00:14:12,205
You asked to see where I found it.
This is where I found it.

153
00:14:12,858 --> 00:14:15,090
We're done. Have an nice hike.

154
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,282
You did not find
the statue here.

155
00:14:23,315 --> 00:14:25,160
Take me to the plane.

156
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:32,630
How'd you know about
the plane, man?

157
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:37,074
It's old, you know.

158
00:14:38,522 --> 00:14:40,707
Been out in the
jungle for years.

159
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:46,104
Of course, you would know that.
You know everything.

160
00:14:46,204 --> 00:14:48,811
Why did you lie to the girl?

161
00:14:49,651 --> 00:14:50,785
What?

162
00:14:50,877 --> 00:14:54,598
You told her you did not know
what was inside the statue.

163
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,494
I wasn't lying.

164
00:14:56,576 --> 00:14:59,190
Then what is the wrong idea?

165
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,512
What?

166
00:15:00,651 --> 00:15:03,753
When I showed you the
broken pieces of plaster,

167
00:15:03,789 --> 00:15:07,368
you said you did not want
her to get the wrong idea.

168
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,609
What is the wrong idea?

169
00:15:13,318 --> 00:15:15,268
I don't have to tell
you anything, man.

170
00:15:15,273 --> 00:15:17,460
You come traipsing across
the island and what,

171
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,437
suddenly now, you're in charge?

172
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:21,039
You want me to take
you to your plane?

173
00:15:21,069 --> 00:15:23,185
You best start treating
me with some respect.

174
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:25,675
I'm not just some
guy you can just tr--

175
00:15:30,343 --> 00:15:31,095
What?

176
00:15:34,084 --> 00:15:35,505
What?

177
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:37,725
Let's go.

178
00:15:40,559 --> 00:15:41,843
Yes, sir.

179
00:15:56,836 --> 00:16:00,515
Sir-- sir,if you buy a statue,

180
00:16:00,588 --> 00:16:06,563
the money will buy polio vaccine
for the village. 300 Naira, sir.

181
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,054
What are you doing here?

182
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,743
I have come to give
my confession.

183
00:16:22,905 --> 00:16:24,352
Hello, Eko.

184
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:27,235
Hello, brother.

185
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:33,499
So I've come to visit you for
the first time in three years

186
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:36,206
and you won't hear
my confession?

187
00:16:36,765 --> 00:16:41,062
You know, monsignor would have said he
failed to raise a proper catholic boy.

188
00:16:41,142 --> 00:16:44,455
Well, why waste your time confessing?
It won't help you.

189
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:45,461
It won't?

190
00:16:45,569 --> 00:16:49,052
No, for confession to mean something,
you must have a penitent heart.

191
00:16:49,166 --> 00:16:50,946
You and your guilt, Yemi.

192
00:16:51,061 --> 00:16:55,630
I've only done what I needed to
do to survive. How is that a sin?

193
00:16:55,747 --> 00:16:57,334
You may live far from here,

194
00:16:57,475 --> 00:17:01,738
but that doesn't mean I haven't heard
of who you are and what you have done.

195
00:17:07,996 --> 00:17:10,944
Have you forgotten how you
got that cross, brother?

196
00:17:11,036 --> 00:17:12,601
The day they took me...

197
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,809
is what I did that day
a sin or is it forgiven,

198
00:17:16,887 --> 00:17:20,303
because it is you
that was saved?

199
00:17:30,965 --> 00:17:33,042
Why are you here, Eko?

200
00:17:33,508 --> 00:17:35,898
I have come to help you.

201
00:17:36,815 --> 00:17:40,621
I have some merchandise that I
need to get out of the country.

202
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:44,567
I would like to use one of your church
relief flights to transport it.

203
00:17:44,683 --> 00:17:46,225
"Merchandise"?

204
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:48,172
You mean drugs.

205
00:17:48,727 --> 00:17:51,501
It is not my normal
business, Yemi.

206
00:17:51,622 --> 00:17:56,765
We are moving the drugs out of Nigeria,
so that they cannot be used by
our people,

207
00:17:56,904 --> 00:18:03,493
and the money-- you have all
the money to buy your vaccine.

208
00:18:04,483 --> 00:18:07,597
God has given us
this opportunity.

209
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:09,443
We should not turn
our back on it.

210
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:14,439
God did not bring you here, Eko.
Your own greed did.

211
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:19,873
Now I will always love you...

212
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,835
but I will not help you.

213
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:31,603
It's good to see
you again, brother.

214
00:18:45,335 --> 00:18:48,785
A little close to the ear, Freckles.
Sure you know what you're doing?

215
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:51,038
Would you please
turn your head?

216
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:54,855
Why? You ain't got a clean
enough shot at my neck?

217
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,328
I can cut my own damn hair.

218
00:18:57,397 --> 00:19:01,241
You know, you don't have to be
belligerent just for belligerent's sake.

219
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:03,176
Everyone loves you now.

220
00:19:03,357 --> 00:19:04,682
Bullpuckey.

221
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:09,365
Yo, Sawyer,
glad you're back, man.

222
00:19:11,912 --> 00:19:14,862
Yo, yourself... Pillsbury.

223
00:19:15,006 --> 00:19:15,768
See?

224
00:19:16,236 --> 00:19:20,596
Hey, Kate... hey,
Locke said you were on hatch duty later.

225
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:22,691
I was wondering if, uh,

226
00:19:23,366 --> 00:19:25,164
you mind if I go instead?

227
00:19:25,243 --> 00:19:26,730
You want my shift?

228
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,175
Help me take my
mind off things.

229
00:19:30,015 --> 00:19:34,083
- Sure. It's all yours.
- Thanks. Appreciate it.

230
00:19:39,152 --> 00:19:41,432
Glad you're okay, man.

231
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:43,683
Yeah.

232
00:19:51,503 --> 00:19:53,093
Don't even say it.

233
00:19:54,634 --> 00:19:58,344
All right,
time to take a break.

234
00:19:58,464 --> 00:20:00,360
We just had a break.

235
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,317
I'm not what you think I am.

236
00:20:14,297 --> 00:20:16,958
And what do I think you are?

237
00:20:17,588 --> 00:20:19,955
It was my brother's fault.

238
00:20:20,178 --> 00:20:20,858
Sorry?

239
00:20:20,977 --> 00:20:23,660
It was his fault I
became an addict.

240
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,509
He started with the heroin.
I tried to make him stop.

241
00:20:27,303 --> 00:20:30,398
You don't know me, man.
I was a good person.

242
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:32,681
I was an altar boy.

243
00:20:34,119 --> 00:20:35,797
All right,
I knew what was in that statue,

244
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:40,422
it doesn't mean I needed what was
inside it, so don't judge me, man.

245
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:43,005
- Don't--
- Shh.

246
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:46,890
What?

247
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:58,208
What's that?

248
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,141
It's a parachute.

249
00:21:16,982 --> 00:21:18,356
That a priest?

250
00:21:24,685 --> 00:21:25,635
What are you doing?

251
00:21:40,717 --> 00:21:42,519
You  know that guy?

252
00:21:45,524 --> 00:21:50,310
Yes.  This man saved my life.

253
00:21:57,058 --> 00:22:00,818
Saved your life, huh?
Sure, that makes sense.

254
00:22:01,144 --> 00:22:05,285
He takes off in a plane in Nigeria,
we're out in the middle of the
South Pacific.

255
00:22:06,171 --> 00:22:08,071
That makes all the
sense in the world.

256
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:22,295
This is scripture written here.

257
00:22:26,732 --> 00:22:27,798
You're a priest.

258
00:22:28,198 --> 00:22:31,698
You're a priest, right? He's a priest
and you're a priest, too, right?

259
00:22:42,773 --> 00:22:44,220
I need to talk to you.

260
00:22:44,428 --> 00:22:46,048
I'm in the middle
of confession.

261
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:47,679
It cannot wait.

262
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:49,478
Bless you.

263
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:53,545
God be with you all and please
come back in the morning.

264
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:56,620
It's okay.

265
00:23:03,688 --> 00:23:05,440
How dare you come here
and disrupt my work.

266
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,570
Have you reconsidered?

267
00:23:06,602 --> 00:23:08,024
- What?
- My request.

268
00:23:08,117 --> 00:23:10,088
Flying drugs under the
cover of the church?

269
00:23:10,118 --> 00:23:12,021
How is that something I
could ever reconsider?

270
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:13,551
Look-- hey, don't touch those!

271
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:15,559
I am going to make
this easy for you.

272
00:23:15,653 --> 00:23:19,127
You make us priests and we will
fly the drugs out ourselves.

273
00:23:19,405 --> 00:23:20,457
Make you priests?

274
00:23:20,606 --> 00:23:24,856
Just sign these ordination documents,
and I will give you the money for
the vaccines.

275
00:23:25,889 --> 00:23:28,533
Leave this church now, Eko.

276
00:23:28,627 --> 00:23:30,192
Go, now.

277
00:23:32,205 --> 00:23:33,095
Yemi,

278
00:23:33,748 --> 00:23:38,318
I understand that you live in a world
where righteousness and evil seem very
far apart,

279
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:41,045
but that is not the real world.

280
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:45,276
I am your brother and I would
never do anything to hurt you,

281
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,183
but my friends,
if you do not do what I ask,

282
00:23:49,274 --> 00:23:52,127
they will burn this
church to the ground.

283
00:23:58,293 --> 00:24:01,831
Is that worth less than the price
of your name on a piece of paper?

284
00:24:07,046 --> 00:24:09,325
Think of the lives
you will save.

285
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,448
My signature does not
make you a priest, Eko.

286
00:24:31,674 --> 00:24:33,308
You could never be a priest.

287
00:24:34,382 --> 00:24:38,120
How many of the statues do you have
left, the Virgin Mary statues, how many?

288
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:40,773
- Uh, 300.
- I will take all of them.

289
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:49,327
I guess we are
both sinners now.

290
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,690
Perhaps we are,

291
00:24:54,605 --> 00:24:57,173
but God will forgive me, Eko.

292
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,649
Uh...

293
00:25:20,431 --> 00:25:21,471
I'm lost.

294
00:25:22,606 --> 00:25:25,077
It was dark.
I was following Sayid.

295
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:27,527
Right afterwards,
a big bag of rocks fell on my head,

296
00:25:27,557 --> 00:25:32,049
so I'm sorry if I'm a bit
spotty with the geography.

297
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:36,777
Climb that tree.

298
00:25:38,053 --> 00:25:38,648
What?

299
00:25:38,757 --> 00:25:43,043
Climb that tree and perhaps you'll be
able to get your bearings or see
the plane.

300
00:25:45,673 --> 00:25:46,963
You climb it.

301
00:25:48,007 --> 00:25:49,456
What if I don't?

302
00:25:49,569 --> 00:25:51,610
You gonna beat me with
your Jesus stick?

303
00:25:51,762 --> 00:25:55,066
I find it a little odd that your
scripture stick has dried blood on it.

304
00:25:55,096 --> 00:25:58,161
Are you going to climb
that tree or not?

305
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,139
What kind of priest
are you, anyway?

306
00:26:30,702 --> 00:26:31,852
You need to get higher.

307
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:36,166
Wonderful. Thank you.

308
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:08,686
Eko! Run! Run!

309
00:28:16,439 --> 00:28:17,449
Did you see it?

310
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:19,284
Yeah, I saw it.
What the bloody hell did you do?

311
00:28:19,314 --> 00:28:20,290
I did nothing.

312
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,515
Most people,

313
00:28:21,608 --> 00:28:24,604
when they see a creature made of
swirling black smoke, they run.

314
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:25,969
I was not afraid of it.

315
00:28:26,059 --> 00:28:27,532
I can see that.
That thing kills people.

316
00:28:27,562 --> 00:28:28,662
Did you see the plane?

317
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:31,286
Yes, I saw your plane.
It's about a kilometer that way.

318
00:28:31,316 --> 00:28:32,095
Thank you.

319
00:28:33,787 --> 00:28:34,597
Wait!

320
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,661
Come on.

321
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:10,520
Come on.

322
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,379
Where are you?

323
00:29:15,807 --> 00:29:16,681


324
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:23,545


325
00:29:29,492 --> 00:29:30,656


326
00:29:34,114 --> 00:29:35,943


327
00:29:38,036 --> 00:29:39,373


328
00:29:40,163 --> 00:29:44,950


329
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,739


330
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:54,456


331
00:29:57,585 --> 00:29:58,395
Hey, Michael.

332
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:03,414
Hey.

333
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,583
How you doing?

334
00:30:04,777 --> 00:30:06,863
I'm good. Thanks.

335
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:10,042
You down here alone?

336
00:30:10,722 --> 00:30:13,943
Yeah. Hurley's supposed to be here,
but, uh,

337
00:30:14,208 --> 00:30:15,717
I guess he's running late.

338
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:23,750
Well, listen, uh...

339
00:30:27,881 --> 00:30:30,380
No one's forgotten about Walt.

340
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:33,873
- What?
- I can't...

341
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:36,539
I don't have any idea what
you must be going through,

342
00:30:36,569 --> 00:30:40,432
but I just want you to know
that as soon as we can,

343
00:30:40,517 --> 00:30:44,722
we're gonna figure out a way
to go out and bring him back.

344
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:48,312
Yeah.

345
00:30:49,995 --> 00:30:51,293
Thanks, man.

346
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:52,838
Thanks.

347
00:30:56,649 --> 00:30:57,784
You okay?

348
00:30:58,483 --> 00:31:00,409
Yeah, I'm fine.

349
00:31:07,656 --> 00:31:09,474
Well,  I'll leave
you to it, then.

350
00:31:11,237 --> 00:31:11,972
Thanks.

351
00:32:08,446 --> 00:32:09,199
Eko.

352
00:32:27,785 --> 00:32:29,285
What are you doing here, Yemi?

353
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:31,532
- I came to stop you.
- Go back to your church.

354
00:32:31,562 --> 00:32:32,965
Do not get on that plane, Eko.

355
00:32:32,995 --> 00:32:34,921
You saved my life once.
Now I'm here to save yours.

356
00:32:34,951 --> 00:32:35,805
Save my life?

357
00:32:35,893 --> 00:32:37,584
Look, you get on that plane,
if you do this--

358
00:32:37,614 --> 00:32:40,192
If I do what, Yemi?
Are you a prophet now?

359
00:32:40,302 --> 00:32:42,786
Please, Eko.
Let me take your confession.

360
00:32:42,912 --> 00:32:47,292
Anything I can do, I will do,
but please, don't go.

361
00:32:54,209 --> 00:32:55,846
He told the military!

362
00:32:59,055 --> 00:33:01,052
You did this?

363
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:02,928
I did not tell them
who was involved.

364
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:05,383
Just leave the drugs
and come back with me.

365
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,288
No! Stop! No more!

366
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:26,073
Yemi! Yemi! Yemi! No! No! No!

367
00:33:27,658 --> 00:33:28,881
Help me get him!

368
00:35:42,343 --> 00:35:43,287
Father?

369
00:35:48,993 --> 00:35:50,627
Are you okay, father?

370
00:36:11,112 --> 00:36:11,954
Eko?

371
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:16,182
Who's that?

372
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:20,637
He is my brother.

373
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:32,503
I'm sorry.

374
00:36:58,929 --> 00:37:00,373
For the one I broke.

375
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,907
So are you a priest
or aren't you?

376
00:37:51,784 --> 00:37:55,877
Yes. I am.

377
00:38:00,175 --> 00:38:02,284
"The Lord is my shepherd,

378
00:38:03,152 --> 00:38:04,859
I shall not want,

379
00:38:05,788 --> 00:38:09,487
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures,

380
00:38:09,842 --> 00:38:12,717
He leadeth me beside
the still waters,

381
00:38:13,583 --> 00:38:15,747
He restoreth my soul,

382
00:38:16,882 --> 00:38:20,970
He leadeth me in paths of
righteousness for his name's sake,

383
00:38:21,242 --> 00:38:25,251
yea, though I walk through the
shadow of the valley of death,

384
00:38:25,362 --> 00:38:27,251
I will fear no evil,

385
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,489
for thou art with me,

386
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:35,304
thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

387
00:38:38,306 --> 00:38:41,443
Thou preparest a
table before me

388
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:44,905
in the presence
of mine enemies,

389
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:50,485
thou anointest my
head with oil,

390
00:38:50,655 --> 00:38:54,347
my cup runneth over,

391
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:58,657
surely, goodness and
mercy shall follow me

392
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,197
all the days of my life,

393
00:39:01,663 --> 00:39:06,215
and I will dwell in
the house of the Lord

394
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,257
forever."

395
00:39:10,886 --> 00:39:11,815
Amen.

396
00:40:11,381 --> 00:40:12,353
Claire?

397
00:40:15,018 --> 00:40:16,678
You lied to me, Charlie.

398
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:22,740
I know I did.

399
00:40:23,714 --> 00:40:24,875
I'm sorry.

400
00:40:28,264 --> 00:40:33,034
Just... it made me feel
safer to have it around.

401
00:40:33,143 --> 00:40:35,265
Look, I can't have you
around my baby, okay?

402
00:40:35,295 --> 00:40:36,095
Claire, I don't--

403
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:39,647
Charlie, I don't want you
sleeping anywhere near us, okay?

404
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:45,839
Just go.

405
00:42:13,833 --> 00:42:19,119
