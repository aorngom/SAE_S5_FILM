1
00:00:00,483 --> 00:00:01,905
Previously on "Lost"...

2
00:00:03,726 --> 00:00:06,005
Ow! Oh, damn it.

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:09,091
- You all right, brother?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

4
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,367
- I'm training.
- Training for what?

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,311
For a race around the world.

6
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,710
- Jack.
- I'm Desmond.

7
00:00:19,362 --> 00:00:21,690
See ya in another life, yeah?

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,434
Type in exactly what I tell you,
you understand? Exactly. Nothin' else.

9
00:00:43,464 --> 00:00:44,359
4...

10
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:46,984
8...

11
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,800
15...

12
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,820
16...

13
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:54,640
23...

14
00:00:56,366 --> 00:00:57,786
42...

15
00:00:57,907 --> 00:00:59,232
Now press "execute."

16
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,743
- What's gonna happen?
- Just push it!

17
00:01:02,582 --> 00:01:04,767
Kate! Locke!

18
00:01:05,186 --> 00:01:06,702
Who the hell is that?

19
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,451
Move, and I kill him.

20
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,428
Michael! Sawyer!

21
00:01:30,568 --> 00:01:31,654
Jin!

22
00:01:35,157 --> 00:01:37,298
Others. Others.

23
00:01:37,434 --> 00:01:38,713
Others! Others!

24
00:01:38,897 --> 00:01:41,608
- Other what?
- Others.

25
00:02:33,755 --> 00:02:35,368
Where's my boy?

26
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:38,099
Where's my boy?

27
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,924
Hey!

28
00:02:40,671 --> 00:02:42,568
Hey, what did you
do with my boy?!

29
00:02:42,753 --> 00:02:43,990
You hear me?

30
00:02:44,124 --> 00:02:45,669
Come back here!

31
00:02:48,331 --> 00:02:49,943
Do you want him to die?

32
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,454
Put it down.

33
00:02:56,358 --> 00:02:59,212
Is this what you were
talking about, Locke?

34
00:02:59,632 --> 00:03:01,099
Is this your destiny?

35
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,267
All roads lead here.

36
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:11,257
My mother stole again
from me this week.

37
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:14,800
I don't even keep money in my
purse anymore. I've been hiding it.

38
00:03:15,593 --> 00:03:17,444
But when she wants a drink...

39
00:03:18,704 --> 00:03:20,701
she stole $30.

40
00:03:21,537 --> 00:03:24,465
I know it may not seem like a
lot of money to some of you,

41
00:03:24,559 --> 00:03:26,265
but it's a lot to me,

42
00:03:27,012 --> 00:03:28,957
and I want it back.

43
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,810
Something you want to say?

44
00:03:35,378 --> 00:03:39,089
John, you've been coming
here for a month now--

45
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:42,272
I just don't think $30is
worth getting angry about.

46
00:03:42,738 --> 00:03:44,303
Well, Francine
feels like $30--

47
00:03:44,397 --> 00:03:47,248
Francine feels a little too much,
you ask me.

48
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,861
You all do.

49
00:03:49,584 --> 00:03:51,674
I mean, seriously.

50
00:03:51,952 --> 00:03:55,185
"So and so never called me back",
"my mother stole $30from me."

51
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:57,588
I never even knew
who my parents were.

52
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:03,903
Couple years ago, my, uh,
my birth mother found me, and, uh,

53
00:04:03,996 --> 00:04:05,846
she told me...

54
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:09,984
I was special.

55
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,767
And, uh, through her,
I met my real father.

56
00:04:16,861 --> 00:04:18,185
Great news, right?

57
00:04:18,324 --> 00:04:21,845
Well, he pretended to
love me just long enough

58
00:04:21,937 --> 00:04:24,423
to steal my kidney because
he had to have a transplant.

59
00:04:24,453 --> 00:04:27,878
And then he dropped me back in
the world like a piece of trash,

60
00:04:27,971 --> 00:04:30,171
just like he did on the
day that I was born.

61
00:04:32,771 --> 00:04:37,148
You want your damn $30 back!
I want my kidney back.

62
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:49,182
Probably a good idea.

63
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:53,970
You know, if you get kidney cancer,
you've only got one.

64
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:56,319
That's funny.

65
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,162
I'm sorry if I
ruined your meeting.

66
00:05:01,307 --> 00:05:04,965
Oh, hell. You just said everything
I've always wanted to say in there.

67
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:07,666
Most of the time,
I want to stand up and scream,

68
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,466
"get over it, freaks."

69
00:05:09,605 --> 00:05:10,872
Well, why don't you?

70
00:05:11,097 --> 00:05:12,756
Well, I have to
keep a cork in.

71
00:05:12,989 --> 00:05:16,032
If I get all hot and bothered,
there's no stoppin' me.

72
00:05:18,973 --> 00:05:21,348
Guess you won't becoming
back next week, huh?

73
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:24,945
- No. Not likely.
- Hmm. That's too bad.

74
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:27,927
I like bald guys.

75
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,906
- Well, I'm not bald.
- I can wait.

76
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:38,124
I'm-- I'm Helen... by the way.

77
00:05:39,374 --> 00:05:41,607
Hi, Helen. I'm John.

78
00:05:44,228 --> 00:05:45,595
Where's Kate?

79
00:05:45,737 --> 00:05:49,158
Lower your gun,
or I'll blow his damn head off.

80
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:50,578
Where's Kate?!

81
00:06:41,415 --> 00:06:42,116
Put it down.

82
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:43,633
I'm not putting down anything.

83
00:06:43,663 --> 00:06:46,014
Calm down. It's okay.

84
00:06:52,926 --> 00:06:54,442
- Do not move.
- No, don't--

85
00:06:54,535 --> 00:06:55,828
- Don't what?
- He's unarmed.

86
00:06:55,858 --> 00:06:58,041
He just had a gun
pointed at your head.

87
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:03,255
Oh, what did you do?

88
00:07:05,348 --> 00:07:07,293
What did you do?

89
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:13,470
We're all gonna die.

90
00:07:18,515 --> 00:07:20,030
We're all gonna die.

91
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:23,927
I have to fix it.

92
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,262
What the hell's
he talking about?

93
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:25,855
Listen!

94
00:07:25,948 --> 00:07:27,889
If you do not let me up,
we are gonna die.

95
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:29,307
Stop moving,
or I swear to god...

96
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:30,616
Look at the wall!

97
00:07:31,132 --> 00:07:32,548
You see that?

98
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,731
That's a timer,
and it's countin' down.

99
00:07:37,294 --> 00:07:39,994
I've gotta enter the code.
I've gotta push the button.

100
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:40,799
Or  what?

101
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,665
- Jack, you should let him up.
- Don't tell me what to do!

102
00:07:43,695 --> 00:07:44,447
Or what?

103
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:46,242
What's gonna happen?

104
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,939
Do I know you?

105
00:07:57,397 --> 00:07:58,627
You got him?

106
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:09,174
Bastard.

107
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:14,553
What?

108
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:16,492
Nothing, Jack.

109
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:32,940
Hey.

110
00:08:34,528 --> 00:08:36,241
What  are you doin'?

111
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:41,057
Where are you going?

112
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,475
Nowhere, I...

113
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:45,007
I'm...

114
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:49,684
I just have trouble
sleeping in a strange bed.

115
00:08:51,602 --> 00:08:54,692
No, it--it has nothing to do with you,
Helen. I promise.

116
00:08:54,777 --> 00:08:56,151
I really like you.

117
00:08:59,185 --> 00:09:02,020
I'm sorry.
I'll call you later.

118
00:09:25,113 --> 00:09:25,898
Morning.

119
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,667
Morning.

120
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:33,279
John, I know you like to
drive through my neighborhood.

121
00:09:33,748 --> 00:09:39,319
And I know that every now and then
you like to park outside my house.

122
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:46,005
Now I thought it might all stop when
I moved, but, uh, here you are.

123
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:50,598
Now I admit,
at first I thought it was funny.

124
00:09:51,912 --> 00:09:54,241
Now it's just annoying.

125
00:09:54,326 --> 00:09:57,656
So how about you tell me what
the hell it is you want?

126
00:10:01,906 --> 00:10:03,660
Why?

127
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,114
Excuse me?

128
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:09,592
Why?

129
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:20,238
There is no "why."

130
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:24,857
You think you're the first
person that ever got conned?

131
00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:27,763
You needed a father figure,
and I needed a kidney,

132
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,040
and that's what happened.

133
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:33,349
Get over it.

134
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:38,439
And, John, don't come back.

135
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:42,824
You're not wanted.

136
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:07,927
I don't think you
need that, Kate.

137
00:11:13,444 --> 00:11:15,405
Whatever you're looking for,
maybe I can help.

138
00:11:15,435 --> 00:11:16,933
Can you fix a computer?

139
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,668
Then you can't help me,
can you?

140
00:11:19,761 --> 00:11:21,378
Sayid can fix a computer.

141
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:23,445
Get him.

142
00:11:23,819 --> 00:11:25,383
Go and get Sayid.

143
00:11:25,661 --> 00:11:27,161
Can you get back up that rope?

144
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,350
I won't have to. There's gotta
be a front door in this place.

145
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:30,880
Down the corridor to the left.

146
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:32,830
Be persistent,
the wheel sticks.

147
00:11:34,927 --> 00:11:36,014
Got ya.

148
00:11:52,505 --> 00:11:55,369
Now you're gonna tell
me what's goin' on.

149
00:11:55,449 --> 00:11:56,600
Jack, we don't
have time for th--

150
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,362
- We're taking a time-out.
- Please, just let me--

151
00:11:58,392 --> 00:12:01,742
Look, you wanna get to work,
you're gonna tell me how you got here.

152
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:04,481
It was three years ago.

153
00:12:04,698 --> 00:12:06,693
I was on a solo race
around the world,

154
00:12:06,786 --> 00:12:09,877
and my boat crashed into the reef,
and then Kelvin came.

155
00:12:10,017 --> 00:12:10,818
Kelvin?

156
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:12,645
Kelvin. He comes
runnin' out the jungle.

157
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:14,369
"Hurry, hurry, come with me."

158
00:12:15,396 --> 00:12:17,200
He brings me down here.

159
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:19,968
First thing he does,
'cause it's beepin' already,

160
00:12:19,998 --> 00:12:23,376
he types in the code,
he pushes the button, and it stops.

161
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,637
"What was all that
about?" I say.

162
00:12:29,219 --> 00:12:31,308
"Just savin' the
world," he says.

163
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,957
Saving the world?

164
00:12:36,065 --> 00:12:37,852
His words, not mine.

165
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,506
So I started pushing
the button, too.

166
00:12:43,535 --> 00:12:46,686
And we saved the world together
for awhile, and that was lovely.

167
00:12:46,716 --> 00:12:50,475
Then Kelvin died,
and now here I am all alone.

168
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,236
The end.

169
00:13:10,577 --> 00:13:12,921
Don't tell me you believe this.
This is crazy.

170
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:15,247
You think that makes sense,
pushing a button?

171
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:17,927
You're gonna take
his word for it?

172
00:13:17,957 --> 00:13:20,283
His word is all we have, Jack.

173
00:13:21,544 --> 00:13:23,444
You don't have to
take my word for it.

174
00:13:23,486 --> 00:13:25,099
Watch the film.

175
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:27,959
What?

176
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:31,617
The bookcase, top shelf,
behind "turn of the screw."

177
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:33,712
Projector's in the pantry.

178
00:14:04,873 --> 00:14:05,721
Here.

179
00:14:09,364 --> 00:14:11,215
Dude, I gotta say,

180
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,951
I didn't think we were
gonna get through the night.

181
00:14:14,282 --> 00:14:17,565
And I wasn't even here for
that baby stealing part.

182
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:20,121
I can assure you it
was very exciting.

183
00:14:20,197 --> 00:14:23,017
It's about time things are
finally returning to normalness.

184
00:14:23,047 --> 00:14:23,942
Sayid!

185
00:14:25,965 --> 00:14:27,228
Aw, crap.

186
00:14:28,538 --> 00:14:29,621
Sayid...

187
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:32,370
We need your help.

188
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:42,080
What do you know?
What did they do to you?

189
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,275
Who the hell are they?

190
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:45,953
Who the hell are they?

191
00:14:47,979 --> 00:14:49,210
Others.

192
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,820
Did you see Walt?

193
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,764
The others-- how many?

194
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,111
How many?

195
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:02,205
They had him
blindfolded. Blindfolded.

196
00:15:03,091 --> 00:15:05,276
Could be a hundred
of 'em out there.

197
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,625
- Push me up.
- What?

198
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:13,083
Boost me up.

199
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:15,062
I'm gonna try to
get us outta here.

200
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,691
Come  on. Help us out, Chewie.

201
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:23,228
  

202
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:25,101
  

203
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:27,247
  

204
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:37,089
They got it weighted
down with something.

205
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:39,429
It's tied off somewhere.

206
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:42,667
Come on. Lift me higher.

207
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:23,936
It's a girl.

208
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:36,332
Wanna tell me what was goin' on
down here before I showed up, John?

209
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:39,796
Kate was tied up.
Desmond had a gun on me.

210
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:42,688
I think you pretty much
caught the gist of it.

211
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:45,257
Desmond.

212
00:16:47,872 --> 00:16:49,773
He wanted to know
a lot about us--

213
00:16:50,107 --> 00:16:52,526
how we got here,
if we were sick.

214
00:16:52,613 --> 00:16:54,701
You didn't ask
anything about him?

215
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:56,499
He was the one with the gun.

216
00:16:56,593 --> 00:17:01,043
You sure seem calm for someone who
believes the world's gonna end in the
next 45 minutes.

217
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:02,388
He'll fix it.

218
00:17:03,462 --> 00:17:06,411
You understand that what
he's saying, it's...

219
00:17:07,155 --> 00:17:09,150
it's insane. It's impossible.

220
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,993
Why is it insane?

221
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:15,168
Because the last time I saw the
computer that was gonna save the world,

222
00:17:15,215 --> 00:17:16,684
it didn't look like that.

223
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:21,105
Is the reason you're so upset
because he said he recognized you?

224
00:17:28,688 --> 00:17:32,195
Because that would
be impossible.

225
00:17:56,023 --> 00:17:58,925
Welcome. I'm Dr.
Marvin Candle,

226
00:17:58,988 --> 00:18:00,598
and this is the
orientation film

227
00:18:00,676 --> 00:18:03,883
for station 3 of the
Dharma Initiative.

228
00:18:04,142 --> 00:18:05,134
In a moment,

229
00:18:05,257 --> 00:18:09,023
you'll be given a simple set of
instructions for how you and
your partner

230
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:12,258
will fulfill the responsibilities
associated with this station.

231
00:18:12,294 --> 00:18:14,490
But first, a little history.

232
00:18:15,015 --> 00:18:18,514
The Dharma Initiative
was created in 1970

233
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:21,890
and is the brainchild of
Gerald and Karen Degroot,

234
00:18:22,005 --> 00:18:24,883
two doctoral candidates at
the university of Michigan.

235
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:29,072
Following in the footsteps of
visionaries such as B.F. Skinner--

236
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:33,071
...imagined a large-scale
communal research compound,

237
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,966
where scientists and free
thinkers from around the globe

238
00:18:36,011 --> 00:18:39,152
could pursue research
in meteorology,

239
00:18:39,266 --> 00:18:40,445
psychology,

240
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:42,272
parapsychology,

241
00:18:42,365 --> 00:18:43,456
zoology,

242
00:18:43,547 --> 00:18:44,987
electromagnetism

243
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:48,740
and utopian social--
...reclusive Danish industrialist

244
00:18:48,814 --> 00:18:51,718
and munitions
magnate Alvar Hanso,

245
00:18:51,807 --> 00:18:55,329
whose financial backing made
their dream of a multipurpose...

246
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:59,066
social science research
facility a reality.

247
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:03,698
You and your partner are currently
located in station 3-- or the swan--

248
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,453
and will be for
the next 540 days.

249
00:19:06,824 --> 00:19:10,686
Now station 3 was originally
constructed as a laboratory

250
00:19:10,777 --> 00:19:12,927
where scientists could
work to understand the

251
00:19:12,957 --> 00:19:18,339
unique electromagnetic fluctuations
emanating from this sector of
the island.

252
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:22,241
Not long after the
experiments began, however,

253
00:19:22,318 --> 00:19:25,161
there was... an incident.

254
00:19:25,555 --> 00:19:29,497
And since that time, the following
protocol has been observed.

255
00:19:29,903 --> 00:19:34,633
Every 108 minutes,
the button must be pushed.

256
00:19:34,713 --> 00:19:37,354
From the moment
the alarm sounds,

257
00:19:37,474 --> 00:19:40,179
you will have four
minutes to enter the code

258
00:19:40,251 --> 00:19:42,578
into the
microcomputer processor.

259
00:19:42,696 --> 00:19:44,625
...induction into the program.

260
00:19:44,711 --> 00:19:50,333
When the alarm sounds, either you or
your partner must input the code.

261
00:19:50,473 --> 00:19:54,853
It is highly recommended that you and
your partner take alternating shifts.

262
00:19:54,946 --> 00:19:57,696
In this manner,
you will both stay as fresh and alert--

263
00:19:57,707 --> 00:20:00,764
...utmost importance that
when the alarm sounds,

264
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:04,816
the code be entered correctly
and in a timely fashion.

265
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:07,718
Now do not attempt to use
the computer for any--

266
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,954
Congratulations, until
your replacements arrive,

267
00:20:13,001 --> 00:20:15,859
the future of the
project is in your hands.

268
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:17,655
On behalf of the Degroots,

269
00:20:17,794 --> 00:20:21,507
Alvar Hanso and all of us
at the Dharma Initiative,

270
00:20:21,601 --> 00:20:22,788
thank you.

271
00:20:22,941 --> 00:20:24,312
Namaste.

272
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,593
And...

273
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,894
good luck.

274
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,316
We're gonna need to
watch that again.

275
00:20:43,709 --> 00:20:44,988
What's that?

276
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,325
It's a present.
It's been six months.

277
00:20:48,678 --> 00:20:50,624
It's sort of an
anniversary, right?

278
00:20:53,865 --> 00:20:56,847
- I didn't get you anything.
- That's okay.

279
00:20:56,937 --> 00:20:58,552
It only cost me a buck.

280
00:21:08,407 --> 00:21:09,829
It's to my place.

281
00:21:09,972 --> 00:21:11,922
Thought you might be
tired of knocking.

282
00:21:13,508 --> 00:21:17,399
Well, Helen...

283
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,209
I don't know what to say.

284
00:21:22,298 --> 00:21:25,595
There's, uh, there's just one condition,
though, John.

285
00:21:26,227 --> 00:21:28,026
When you stay over,

286
00:21:28,677 --> 00:21:30,572
you stay over.

287
00:21:31,042 --> 00:21:32,316
What do you mean?

288
00:21:33,505 --> 00:21:35,383
I followed you last night,

289
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,841
to that house that you go to.

290
00:21:40,771 --> 00:21:42,826
Is it your father's house?

291
00:21:49,896 --> 00:21:52,893
Why would you follow me, Helen?
Why would you do that?

292
00:21:53,593 --> 00:21:55,943
Well, you sneak off in
the middle of the night.

293
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:59,728
I just needed to know where you
were going. I care about you, John.

294
00:21:59,803 --> 00:22:02,761
No. Well, yeah, but what I do
is my business. It's personal.

295
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:07,011
I wasted 20 years of
my life being angry.

296
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:10,091
I told myself I would get over it,
but I...

297
00:22:10,649 --> 00:22:13,315
I couldn't do it alone.

298
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:17,190
I needed to find help.

299
00:22:19,292 --> 00:22:21,049
You helped me, John.

300
00:22:23,805 --> 00:22:25,587
And  I can help you.

301
00:22:27,109 --> 00:22:31,389
You just have to promise me that you're
not gonna go to that place anymore.

302
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,926
All right.

303
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:40,082
All right?

304
00:23:05,411 --> 00:23:07,090
You're gonna watch that again?

305
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:10,310
Aren't you?

306
00:23:10,635 --> 00:23:13,346
No, John, I'm not.

307
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:34,645
Okay, okay, okay.

308
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,648
Are you all right, sister?

309
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,100
- Who are you?
- We crashed here.

310
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,621
We were on a plane.
Sydney to Los Angeles.

311
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:48,434
What?

312
00:23:49,087 --> 00:23:50,707
40 of us made it.

313
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,866
Flight 815?

314
00:23:59,274 --> 00:24:00,871
You were on it, too?

315
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:05,015
Wait. You were in the back?

316
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,750
It broke off midair.
How did you s--

317
00:24:09,836 --> 00:24:13,291
I don't know. I don't know.
The plane came apart,

318
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:15,792
and somebody's
frickin' hardside

319
00:24:15,867 --> 00:24:18,588
came out of the overhead
and knocked me out.

320
00:24:18,671 --> 00:24:23,798
I woke up underwater and
made my way to the top,

321
00:24:23,968 --> 00:24:25,617
swam to shore.

322
00:24:27,045 --> 00:24:31,189
You've been out here by
yourself all this time?

323
00:24:31,529 --> 00:24:33,193
Trying to find food,

324
00:24:33,702 --> 00:24:36,533
making my way,
hoping to find somebody.

325
00:24:37,384 --> 00:24:40,345
And then yesterday
they found me.

326
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,441
- Who are they?
- You tell me.

327
00:24:42,525 --> 00:24:47,728
Did you see a boy?
10 years old? They took my son.

328
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,160
No. I'm sorry.

329
00:24:53,838 --> 00:24:55,373
I'm Ana Lucia.

330
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:56,674
Sawyer.

331
00:24:57,614 --> 00:24:58,968
This is Mike.

332
00:25:00,322 --> 00:25:02,555
The quiet Korean guy's Jin.

333
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,204
We're about to be the best
thing that ever happened to you.

334
00:25:07,283 --> 00:25:08,510
How's that?

335
00:25:09,352 --> 00:25:11,806
'Cause next time
Shaft opens the cage,

336
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:16,081
he's gonna get a surprising
little howdy doody.

337
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:26,269
Are you in contact with
the people that made it?

338
00:25:26,682 --> 00:25:29,440
The film.
Are you in contact with anyone?

339
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,293
Do you think I'd
be here if I was?

340
00:25:34,048 --> 00:25:36,769
How is it that you didn't
know about the crash,

341
00:25:37,013 --> 00:25:38,177
about us?

342
00:25:39,389 --> 00:25:43,630
I push this button
every 108 minutes.

343
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,893
I don't get out much.

344
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:49,724
So these replacements...

345
00:25:50,278 --> 00:25:55,330
Kelvin died waiting
for his replacements.

346
00:25:55,574 --> 00:25:59,324
So you don't get out. You don't see
anyone. Where does your food come from?

347
00:26:00,154 --> 00:26:02,361
You really think
this is happening?

348
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,503
Why wouldn't it be?

349
00:26:05,408 --> 00:26:07,879
It says "quarantine" on
the inside of the hatch

350
00:26:07,972 --> 00:26:10,588
to keep you down here,
keep you scared.

351
00:26:10,679 --> 00:26:12,196
But you know what?

352
00:26:12,257 --> 00:26:15,432
We've been up there for over 40 days,
and no one's gotten sick.

353
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:18,186
You think this is the only
part of it that's true?

354
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,357
Did you ever think that
maybe they put you down here

355
00:26:20,387 --> 00:26:22,928
to push a button every hundred
minutes just to see if you would--

356
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:24,895
that all of this--
the computer, the button--

357
00:26:24,925 --> 00:26:27,638
it's just a mind game,
an experiment?

358
00:26:29,691 --> 00:26:32,990
Every single day.

359
00:26:38,562 --> 00:26:42,235
And for all our sakes,
I hope it's not real.

360
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:48,162
But the film says this is
an electromagnetic station.

361
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:50,484
And I don't know
about you, brother,

362
00:26:50,632 --> 00:26:53,490
but every time I walk past
that concrete wall out there,

363
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,748
my fillings hurt.

364
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,525
Right.

365
00:27:14,875 --> 00:27:15,826
Oh, no.

366
00:27:16,658 --> 00:27:18,129
What happened?

367
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,579
It's over.

368
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:34,010
What? What do you mean,
"it's over"?

369
00:27:47,734 --> 00:27:49,269
What-- what are you doing?

370
00:27:50,424 --> 00:27:51,688
Are you leaving?

371
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:52,954
Desmond!

372
00:27:53,908 --> 00:27:54,746
Wait.

373
00:27:57,055 --> 00:28:00,481
We can-- we can fix the computer.
Sayid is coming. He knows--

374
00:28:00,574 --> 00:28:01,764
Give him my best.

375
00:28:11,195 --> 00:28:13,008
Wait, wait, wait.
Where are you--

376
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:14,291
You can't leave.

377
00:28:16,003 --> 00:28:17,369
Where are you going?

378
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:20,009
As far as I can run, brother.

379
00:28:27,853 --> 00:28:29,855
- What should we do?
- Nothing.

380
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:32,166
We do nothing.

381
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:33,677
It's not real.
None of it's real.

382
00:28:33,707 --> 00:28:36,846
This isn't--
this isn’t what was supposed to happen!

383
00:28:38,107 --> 00:28:40,560
What was supposed to happen?

384
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:42,612
Jack, please,
don't leave me here.

385
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,369
Good-bye, John.

386
00:28:44,647 --> 00:28:46,689
- You're on your own.
- Jack.

387
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:23,194
Why is this happening like this?
What do you want? What do you--

388
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:28,576
What am I supposed to do?!

389
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,291
Helen, what...

390
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,890
Helen, what-- what--

391
00:30:14,970 --> 00:30:17,044
Hey, Helen, wait.

392
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:18,706
Helen!

393
00:30:19,411 --> 00:30:20,541
Don't!

394
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:21,767
Helen!

395
00:30:24,511 --> 00:30:26,373
Why are you doing this?

396
00:30:26,454 --> 00:30:29,654
He's not coming out of his house,
John, because he doesn't care.

397
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:33,837
I know why you're here,
why you keep coming here.

398
00:30:33,937 --> 00:30:35,278
You're scared.

399
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,048
You're scared of
moving forward--

400
00:30:38,139 --> 00:30:39,929
with me, with us.

401
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,745
You're gonna have to choose.

402
00:30:45,592 --> 00:30:47,681
Him or me?

403
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:53,150
No. No.
No, it's not that simple.

404
00:30:53,245 --> 00:30:55,027
Yes, it is.

405
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:58,062
I... I...

406
00:31:00,666 --> 00:31:02,914
I can't. I can't.

407
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,846
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't!

408
00:31:14,198 --> 00:31:16,205
I don't know how.

409
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:18,576
Because you don't know
what's gonna happen.

410
00:31:20,793 --> 00:31:22,516
None of us do.

411
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,726
That's why it's called
a leap of faith, John.

412
00:31:30,886 --> 00:31:32,777
You don't have to be alone.

413
00:31:53,546 --> 00:31:54,464
Jack?

414
00:31:55,236 --> 00:31:56,276
Jack!

415
00:31:59,312 --> 00:32:00,352
John?

416
00:32:08,669 --> 00:32:09,423
Dude.

417
00:32:13,058 --> 00:32:14,789
What is this place?

418
00:32:15,991 --> 00:32:17,605
John, where's Jack?

419
00:32:17,883 --> 00:32:19,086
Jack's gone.

420
00:32:19,578 --> 00:32:20,883
I need your help.

421
00:32:26,213 --> 00:32:27,484
What does it look like?

422
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:30,171
It's a breaker box.
There has to be one.

423
00:32:30,264 --> 00:32:31,882
Follow the conduit lines.

424
00:32:32,034 --> 00:32:34,731
Cool. Okay, great.
What's a conduit line?

425
00:32:35,736 --> 00:32:37,639
Those tubes-- follow those.

426
00:32:51,405 --> 00:32:52,445
Whoa.

427
00:32:54,212 --> 00:32:55,565
Did you find it?

428
00:32:55,902 --> 00:32:56,757
Uh...

429
00:32:56,907 --> 00:32:57,787
Uh...

430
00:32:59,441 --> 00:33:01,168
Depends on what
you mean by "it."

431
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,262
All right,
here's what we're going to do.

432
00:33:10,292 --> 00:33:11,992
Jin plays dead.
You call for help.

433
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:14,346
Sick prisoner? You serious?

434
00:33:14,434 --> 00:33:16,434
What, you got a better
idea, sweetheart?

435
00:33:17,727 --> 00:33:19,328
Where did you get
that gun anyway?

436
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:20,112
What?

437
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:22,240
The gun.
How did you get it on the plane?

438
00:33:22,282 --> 00:33:24,480
There was a federal
marshal on the plane.

439
00:33:25,025 --> 00:33:27,931
So what,
you just happened to have his gun?

440
00:33:28,085 --> 00:33:31,172
Yeah. I'm lucky. Mike...

441
00:33:32,418 --> 00:33:35,363
How come you didn't use
it when they grabbed you?

442
00:33:36,348 --> 00:33:40,375
Gosh, I guess I was too busy
getting hit in the face with a club.

443
00:33:43,898 --> 00:33:46,544
How come you're suddenly
so interested, cupcake?

444
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:47,915
- Hey!
- What?

445
00:33:48,008 --> 00:33:49,808
Come on, let's just--
we've got to--

446
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:52,342
Back up!

447
00:33:52,872 --> 00:33:53,958
Back up.

448
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,237
Coming out.

449
00:34:01,190 --> 00:34:02,077
Coming out!

450
00:34:14,941 --> 00:34:15,818
What happened?

451
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:16,890
Who are they?

452
00:34:43,186 --> 00:34:44,117
Stop.

453
00:34:47,683 --> 00:34:48,869
Oh, right.

454
00:34:50,311 --> 00:34:51,972
The code, yeah?

455
00:34:52,337 --> 00:34:53,337
What?

456
00:34:53,418 --> 00:34:54,780
Right, listen carefully.

457
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,222
If by some miracle, you manage to
get that computer working again,

458
00:34:57,252 --> 00:35:01,152
you gotta enter the code--
4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

459
00:35:01,168 --> 00:35:02,101
Hit "execute."

460
00:35:02,193 --> 00:35:04,885
- Again-- 4, 8, 15, 16--
- Shut up!

461
00:35:05,726 --> 00:35:06,504
Sorry?

462
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,869
Nothing is going to happen.

463
00:35:09,056 --> 00:35:13,953
Some man takes you down there,
shows you a movie,

464
00:35:14,016 --> 00:35:17,325
and you push a button on--
on faith alone.

465
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,651
Nothing is going to happen!

466
00:35:21,538 --> 00:35:25,093
In about 15 minutes, you're either going
to be very right or very
wrong, brother.

467
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:28,023
You want to shoot me? Shoot me!
But I'm not hanging about.

468
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:31,395
Why are you running? You don't even
know what you're running from!

469
00:35:35,728 --> 00:35:37,200
I remember you.

470
00:35:39,302 --> 00:35:40,587
Running.

471
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:44,706
I know you.

472
00:35:44,992 --> 00:35:46,700
- I met you.
- Stop.

473
00:35:46,763 --> 00:35:49,408
Los Angeles.
I was training, yeah?

474
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,634
- You twisted your ankle.
- Stop.

475
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:54,315
You're a doctor, right?
There was this girl.

476
00:35:54,394 --> 00:35:56,196
You were worried. You said--

477
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:58,245
You said you failed her.

478
00:35:59,821 --> 00:36:03,390
- That was you!
- It doesn't matter.

479
00:36:03,487 --> 00:36:07,882
- Was she okay? The girl?
- It doesn't matter.

480
00:36:07,958 --> 00:36:09,950
- What happened to her?
- It doesn't matter.

481
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,502
- How can you say it doesn't--
- I married her!

482
00:36:22,158 --> 00:36:22,769
Right.

483
00:36:27,127 --> 00:36:27,817
And you...

484
00:36:30,191 --> 00:36:32,807
you're not married
to her anymore then.

485
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:58,416
See you in another life, yeah?

486
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:16,626
Can you fix it?

487
00:37:18,364 --> 00:37:21,506
This man, whoever he was,
replaced the motherboard.

488
00:37:25,273 --> 00:37:27,280
The power
transformer is blown.

489
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,177
Don't you need to know why?

490
00:37:30,057 --> 00:37:33,378
All I need to know is that the
timer is counting down to something

491
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:37,965
and that this computer
needs to be repaired.

492
00:37:38,039 --> 00:37:40,339
I'm sure you'll tell me
why once I've done so.

493
00:37:48,973 --> 00:37:50,421
Found it!

494
00:38:00,796 --> 00:38:01,945
Uh, what's that?

495
00:38:02,028 --> 00:38:04,072
- Sayid?
- I'm working on it.

496
00:38:04,339 --> 00:38:06,475
- You have to--
I know what I have to do.

497
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,874
Reconnected the processor...

498
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,975
Replaced the transformer...

499
00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:21,683
It's on.

500
00:38:22,151 --> 00:38:23,384
Okay. So what now?

501
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:25,393
There was a code.
He made me enter it.

502
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:26,217
What code?

503
00:38:26,378 --> 00:38:27,931
Can you remember what it is?

504
00:38:29,169 --> 00:38:32,399
- 4. 8.
- Wait a minute.

505
00:38:32,493 --> 00:38:36,041
- 15. 16.
- Dude, I'm serious. Stop!

506
00:38:36,118 --> 00:38:37,715
Hugo, this is not
the time or place!

507
00:38:37,745 --> 00:38:38,986
Yeah? Well, I think it is.

508
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:39,828
23...

509
00:38:39,909 --> 00:38:42,426
What is this thing? We don't even
know what it does! I mean, we need--

510
00:38:42,456 --> 00:38:43,497
32.

511
00:38:46,391 --> 00:38:47,782
You know what?

512
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,360
Forget it. Go ahead.
Do your thing.

513
00:38:52,083 --> 00:38:53,701
It's not 32.

514
00:38:56,359 --> 00:38:58,601
It's 42.

515
00:39:00,744 --> 00:39:02,782
He just told me-- Desmond.

516
00:39:02,829 --> 00:39:05,017
The last number's 42.

517
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:07,426
You're sure?

518
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:10,104
Yeah, I'm sure.

519
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:33,315
You do it, Jack.

520
00:39:36,586 --> 00:39:37,292
What?

521
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:41,200
You have to do it.

522
00:39:42,742 --> 00:39:44,266
You do it yourself, John.

523
00:39:44,446 --> 00:39:45,796
No, you saw the film, Jack.

524
00:39:45,856 --> 00:39:49,062
This is a--
this is a 2-person job, at least.

525
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,391
This argument is irrelevant.

526
00:39:53,515 --> 00:39:55,760
Sayid, don't. Jack--

527
00:39:55,845 --> 00:39:57,490
Don't. It's not real.

528
00:39:57,660 --> 00:39:59,935
Look, you want to push the button,
you do it yourself.

529
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,670
If it's not real,
then what are you doing here, Jack?

530
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,547
Why did you come back?

531
00:40:04,557 --> 00:40:06,710
Why do you find it
so hard to believe?!

532
00:40:06,788 --> 00:40:10,429
- Why do you find it so easy?!
- It's never been easy!

533
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:21,230
Maybe you should just do it.

534
00:40:22,261 --> 00:40:23,136
No.

535
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:26,193
It's a button.

536
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,023
I can't do this alone, Jack.

537
00:40:34,622 --> 00:40:36,245
I don't want to.

538
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,554
It's a leap of faith, Jack.

539
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:39,814
I'll take the first shift.

00:41:53,006 --> 00:41:57,814
