1
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:03,156
Sorry, man. I know this hurts.

2
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,510
Michael told me you pulled the
bullet out with your bare hands.

3
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:13,657
You have to show me how
to do that sometime.

4
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,750
Where is she?

5
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:21,462
- What? I didn't--
- Where is she?

6
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:24,144
You mean Kate?

7
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:27,512
She's been watching over you
for the past 24 hours straight.

8
00:01:27,542 --> 00:01:31,592
The only way I could get rid of her was
to send her out to get some food
for you.

9
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,386
I love her.

10
00:03:08,857 --> 00:03:12,473
Well, hey, girl.
What are you doin' here?

11
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,762
Hey, there.

12
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:20,373
All right,
let's get you to bed.

13
00:03:28,883 --> 00:03:30,927
Watch your step,
watch your step!

14
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:35,684
What the hell is that smell?

15
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,131
- Probably your breath.
- Yeah, right.

16
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:38,928
Come on.

17
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,776
You're beautiful.

18
00:03:53,158 --> 00:03:53,912
Hey.

19
00:03:56,294 --> 00:03:59,576
Hey! I just gave
you a compliment.

20
00:03:59,716 --> 00:04:01,281
Yeah, I heard you.

21
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:08,786
Aren't ya gonna take
my pants off first?

22
00:04:17,214 --> 00:04:19,876
You are beautiful.

23
00:04:26,134 --> 00:04:27,031
Good night.

24
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:40,943
Coffee, pie? Both?

25
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,169
How about a beer?

26
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:44,228
I'd like to see some I.D.

27
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,394
I'm 24, ma.

28
00:05:46,534 --> 00:05:49,736
You want to ride around on that
death trap of yours without a helmet,

29
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not going to help your
cause by getting you drunk.

30
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:01,201
How's that wrist?

31
00:06:01,994 --> 00:06:03,655
What, this?

32
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:07,861
You know, that shelf in the
kitchen sticks out sometimes.

33
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:10,153
You'd think I'd remember it was there,
but I banged it--

34
00:06:10,183 --> 00:06:10,841
Don't.

35
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:21,013
I made my bed, Katherine.

36
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:24,547
Well, your bed's gone, ma.

37
00:06:25,059 --> 00:06:25,955
What?

38
00:06:34,974 --> 00:06:36,299
What is this?

39
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:38,332
An insurance policy
for the house.

40
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:41,323
- What? I never--
- I took it out in your name.

41
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,482
What did you do?

42
00:06:49,854 --> 00:06:51,899
Does Wayne know about this?

43
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:59,294
Just remember that you were here
and you didn't see me, okay?

44
00:06:59,324 --> 00:07:01,843
Katherine, what did you do?

45
00:07:02,217 --> 00:07:04,926
I took care of you, ma.

46
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,986
I gotta go.

47
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:10,937
You're not gonna
see me for awhile.

48
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:22,487
Katherine!

49
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,750
What did you do?

50
00:07:25,731 --> 00:07:27,056
Katherine!

51
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:34,840
- Hey.
- Hey.

52
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,865
You okay?

53
00:07:39,515 --> 00:07:42,226
Yeah. Uh, yeah,
I think I'm just...

54
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:44,867
I think I'm tired.

55
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:49,035
How is he?

56
00:07:49,176 --> 00:07:50,643
Fever's still up there.

57
00:07:51,326 --> 00:07:53,558
Can't tell if the
antibiotics are working.

58
00:07:53,697 --> 00:07:55,978
It'll help to get
some food in him.

59
00:07:56,397 --> 00:07:58,347
You should get down
to the beach for...

60
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:00,684
for Shannon.

61
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:06,404
I was actually thinking that I
should stay and watch Sawyer.

62
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:07,917
I'll stay with him.

63
00:08:09,038 --> 00:08:10,936
You should be there.

64
00:08:17,065 --> 00:08:18,477
Keep him hydrated.

65
00:08:18,663 --> 00:08:21,580
Maybe mash upsome of that fruit,
see if you can get him to eat it.

66
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,938
And everybody will beat the beach,
so don't forget the button.

67
00:08:25,123 --> 00:08:26,306
I got it.

68
00:08:26,725 --> 00:08:28,148
Be back in a couple hours.

69
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:28,849
Yep.

70
00:08:32,681 --> 00:08:34,351
You sure you're okay?

71
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,927
Yeah, I'm great.

72
00:08:53,029 --> 00:08:53,823
Hey.

73
00:08:57,934 --> 00:09:00,214
I'm going to go to the funeral.

74
00:09:05,428 --> 00:09:07,851
I don't think I'm
gonna make it.

75
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:22,233
I think most of them
realize it was an accident.

76
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,416
Shannon and I were strangers.

77
00:10:08,367 --> 00:10:10,506
We never would have met if...

78
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:18,163
we wouldn't even
have spoken if...

79
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,152
but we did meet,

80
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,841
and we did speak.

81
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,015
At least...

82
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:46,601
I loved her.

83
00:11:26,209 --> 00:11:27,959
May she rest in peace.

84
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:54,788
You hungry?

85
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:57,827
I'm just gonna mash
you up some fruit here.

86
00:12:00,479 --> 00:12:01,805
When you wake up,

87
00:12:01,898 --> 00:12:04,948
you're going to get a kick out
of me feeding you like a baby.

88
00:12:09,511 --> 00:12:11,410
I saw a horse.

89
00:12:15,053 --> 00:12:19,007
Yeah. That's what happens
when you don't sleep.

90
00:12:29,606 --> 00:12:32,317
Sawyer? You awake?

91
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:34,590
Good for nothing...

92
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,758
You killed me.

93
00:12:40,765 --> 00:12:42,662
Why did you kill me?!

94
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:51,240
It's the alarm.

95
00:12:54,221 --> 00:12:55,116
Kate!

96
00:12:55,864 --> 00:12:56,836
Kate!

97
00:13:05,226 --> 00:13:06,028
Sawyer.

98
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,296
- What happened?
- I don't know.

99
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:36,379
- But you said--
- I don't know, John!

100
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,010
Well, where's Kate?

101
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:47,067
Kate. Hey,
you missed the funeral.

102
00:13:47,221 --> 00:13:49,773
Yeah, uh, I was with Sawyer.

103
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:51,959
Oh, right.

104
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:55,370
A few of them came,
the new people.

105
00:13:56,492 --> 00:14:00,392
Not her, the one who killed Shannon.
That would have been awkward.

106
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,811
They seem to have had
a rough time of it.

107
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:05,943
Looks like they went bloody
"lord of the flies" out there.

108
00:14:09,587 --> 00:14:12,393
You haven't listened
to a word I've said.

109
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:15,463
Do you think there
are horses here?

110
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:16,824
What?

111
00:14:17,112 --> 00:14:19,814
I think I saw a
horse in the jungle.

112
00:14:20,607 --> 00:14:22,984
I've seen polar bears.

113
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,978
I've seen monsters.

114
00:14:25,151 --> 00:14:28,474
Well, heard monsters.
But horses?

115
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:29,681
No.

116
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,286
Kate!

117
00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:33,816
Where are you going?

118
00:14:40,778 --> 00:14:42,820
Tallahassee, one way, please.

119
00:14:43,863 --> 00:14:47,703
Tallahassee? I spent a week
in Tallahassee one night.

120
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:51,172
It's all strip malls
and waffle houses.

121
00:14:51,547 --> 00:14:54,638
What's a pretty girl like you
gonna do down in Tallahassee?

122
00:14:54,825 --> 00:14:56,442
I'm sure I'll find something.

123
00:14:56,579 --> 00:14:58,329
Bet you got family
down there, huh?

124
00:14:58,478 --> 00:15:00,045
Actually, I'm just visiting.

125
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:03,777
Hey.

126
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,028
Hey!

127
00:15:08,177 --> 00:15:09,549
Don't I know you?

128
00:15:18,302 --> 00:15:19,853
No, I don't think so.

129
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:23,395
Don't run, Kate.

130
00:15:30,167 --> 00:15:31,476
I got her.

131
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:34,559
Kate Austen,
you're under arrest for murder.

132
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:36,822
- I didn't do anything.
- Oh, yeah, you did.

133
00:15:37,148 --> 00:15:39,191
Your mama gave you up, Kate.

134
00:15:53,255 --> 00:15:55,918
Charlie, have you seen Kate?

135
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,430
Uh, a little while
ago in the jungle.

136
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:01,869
She was acting kind of balmy,
asking me about horses on the island.

137
00:16:01,942 --> 00:16:03,555
You know where she is now?

138
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:06,321
She's on the path heading
back to the caves.

139
00:16:09,017 --> 00:16:10,277
Everything okay?

140
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,807
Yeah, Charlie,
everything's fine.

141
00:16:25,175 --> 00:16:26,215
Thank you.

142
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,809
Free at last, huh?

143
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,687
Yeah, man. Looks good.

144
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,362
Hey, Locke.

145
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,883
What's up with the blast doors?

146
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,267
Blast doors?

147
00:16:57,334 --> 00:16:58,071
Yeah.

148
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:02,774
Like in case of an explosion,
they'll come from the ceiling.

149
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,811
That guy down here, uh...

150
00:17:05,052 --> 00:17:05,758
Desmond?

151
00:17:05,943 --> 00:17:08,380
Yeah, Desmond. He didn't tell you
about these, what they're for?

152
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,642
No, no, he didn't,

153
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:14,785
but he did leave a movie.

154
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:16,390
A movie?

155
00:17:16,578 --> 00:17:17,330
Yeah.

156
00:17:18,635 --> 00:17:19,774
You want to see it?

157
00:17:21,545 --> 00:17:23,701
I would like to see it, too.

158
00:17:27,186 --> 00:17:28,561
If you don't mind.

159
00:17:32,205 --> 00:17:33,490
Why not?

160
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,090
The more, the merrier.

161
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,051
Kate, what the hell
are you doing out here?

162
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:59,055
What happened in the hatch, Kate?
Why'd you leave?

163
00:17:59,631 --> 00:18:02,594
I come back. I find Sawyer just lying
on the ground. You just took off.

164
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:05,764
- Is he okay?
- Yes, Kate, he's fine.

165
00:18:09,408 --> 00:18:10,612
I'm sorry.

166
00:18:11,538 --> 00:18:12,851
Are you?

167
00:18:16,214 --> 00:18:17,921
Yeah, I'm sorry.

168
00:18:18,575 --> 00:18:21,696
I'm sorry that I am
not as perfect as you!

169
00:18:21,835 --> 00:18:24,021
I'm sorry that I'm not as good!

170
00:18:25,328 --> 00:18:27,972
- What's going on with you?
- Just forget it.

171
00:18:28,157 --> 00:18:29,520
No, don't walk
away from me, no.

172
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:33,050
- Let me go! Don't!
- Kate! Kate, Kate, Kate.

173
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:37,761
It's okay. It's okay. Kate.

174
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:40,462
This place...
this place is crazy.

175
00:18:41,645 --> 00:18:44,483
I can't. It's driving me nuts.

176
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:48,479
I know. It's okay.
It's all right.

177
00:18:49,272 --> 00:18:50,598
It's all right.

178
00:18:50,924 --> 00:18:52,127
All right?

179
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:36,837
Kate!

180
00:19:40,781 --> 00:19:43,398
From the moment
the alarm sounds,

181
00:19:43,582 --> 00:19:46,199
you will have four
minutes to enter the code

182
00:19:46,344 --> 00:19:48,714
into the
microcomputer processor.

183
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,801
Induction into the program.

184
00:19:50,893 --> 00:19:52,410
When the alarm sounds,

185
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:56,185
either you or your partner
must input the code.

186
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:58,391
It is highly
recommended that you

187
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:01,072
and your partner take
alternating shifts.

188
00:20:01,189 --> 00:20:03,998
In this manner,
you will stay as fresh and alert.

189
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:06,941
It is most important that
when the alarm sounds,

190
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:10,941
the code be entered correctly
and in a timely fashion.

191
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:14,708
Do not attempt to use
a computer for any--

192
00:20:14,935 --> 00:20:16,754
Congratulations.

193
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:18,885
Until your replacements arrive,

194
00:20:19,035 --> 00:20:21,975
the future of the
project is in your hands.

195
00:20:22,123 --> 00:20:23,808
On behalf of the Degroots,

196
00:20:23,949 --> 00:20:27,709
Alvar Hanso and all of us
at the Dharma Initiative,

197
00:20:27,895 --> 00:20:34,138
thank you, namaste,
and good luck.

198
00:20:37,384 --> 00:20:38,687
All right.

199
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,796
So you've been pushing that button
every two hours since you got down here.

200
00:20:43,963 --> 00:20:45,243
That's right.

201
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,137
How's that even work?

202
00:20:48,403 --> 00:20:53,084
I've set up 2-person shifts, 6 hours.
Everyone's on the roster.

203
00:20:53,724 --> 00:20:55,527
Don't they want to know why?

204
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:58,119
I think the film is
pretty self-explanatory.

205
00:20:58,214 --> 00:20:59,472
Really?

206
00:20:59,582 --> 00:21:03,391
All I heard was something about
electromagnets and an incident.

207
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,335
What about all the
missing pieces?

208
00:21:05,674 --> 00:21:07,478
Oh, you mean the splices?

209
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:10,935
Yeah, just a frame here and there,
I think, nothing important.

210
00:21:11,076 --> 00:21:12,401
What do you think?

211
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,821
About the film,
what do you think?

212
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:04,283
I'm sorry I missed it,
her funeral.

213
00:22:04,467 --> 00:22:07,082
I... I had to be
with Sawyer, so...

214
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:10,580
Why aren't you with him now?

215
00:22:15,537 --> 00:22:16,989
'Cause I'm going crazy.

216
00:22:26,657 --> 00:22:28,939
Do you believe in
ghosts, Sayid?

217
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:36,888
I saw Walt in the jungle just
before Shannon was shot.

218
00:22:46,654 --> 00:22:49,985
Does that make me crazy?

219
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:10,476
It's a long drive back to
the arraignment. You comfy?

220
00:23:24,076 --> 00:23:25,522
Why now?

221
00:23:28,721 --> 00:23:29,664
What?

222
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:32,619
Nice corn-fed farm
girl like yourself,

223
00:23:32,734 --> 00:23:36,349
no history of violence,
straight A's, no record,

224
00:23:36,543 --> 00:23:38,688
a couple of speeding tickets.

225
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:41,859
I just gotta wonder,
why'd you kill him now?

226
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,462
Oh, right, yeah, don't tell me.

227
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:48,789
You wouldn't want to
incriminate yourself,

228
00:23:48,925 --> 00:23:51,592
not after you were so
smart planning it.

229
00:23:51,742 --> 00:23:56,027
That jury back in Iowa sure ain't
gonna get hung upon premeditation.

230
00:23:56,172 --> 00:23:57,920
And a gas leak?

231
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:02,722
Come on,
it's amateur hour from top to bottom.

232
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:05,120
It sounds like you've
got it all figured out.

233
00:24:05,266 --> 00:24:06,686
I do have you all figured out.

234
00:24:06,716 --> 00:24:08,366
You don't know
anything about me.

235
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:13,008
White-trash mom divorces dad,
starts up with some guy who's a drinker,

236
00:24:13,151 --> 00:24:15,151
maybe he knocks her
around a little bit,

237
00:24:15,171 --> 00:24:18,025
and so she marries him because,
you know,

238
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,853
that's what happens.

239
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:23,133
And then this drunk, this Wayne,
he moves into your house,

240
00:24:23,273 --> 00:24:24,994
and you get to lay
there every night

241
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:29,311
and listen to him doing your mom right
there in your daddy's old bedroom.

242
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:32,944
And even that wouldn't be so bad if
he didn't beat her up all the time.

243
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:38,593
But she loves him,
she defends him.

244
00:24:43,685 --> 00:24:47,542
If that don't make a person want to
kill somebody, I don't know what does.

245
00:24:47,682 --> 00:24:51,377
But the question is, now?
Why now?

246
00:24:51,606 --> 00:24:53,717
Why after all these years

247
00:24:53,858 --> 00:24:56,998
did you just decide to
blow poor Wayne up?

248
00:25:02,185 --> 00:25:05,285
He come knocking on your
door late at night?

249
00:25:06,312 --> 00:25:07,852
He never touched me.

250
00:25:12,882 --> 00:25:13,781
Look out!

251
00:25:40,312 --> 00:25:42,512
Get... get off!

252
00:26:17,088 --> 00:26:19,240
Well, why can't you just
put the numbers in now?

253
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:21,264
No, it doesn't work that way.

254
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:23,525
The alarm goes off
in four minutes.

255
00:26:23,681 --> 00:26:25,733
You can't type
anything till then.

256
00:26:31,406 --> 00:26:33,706
You mind if I check out
some of this hardware?

257
00:26:35,044 --> 00:26:35,943
Sure.

258
00:26:38,579 --> 00:26:40,145
Just don't break it.

259
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:54,890
- Hello again.
- Hello.

260
00:26:57,721 --> 00:27:00,598
I have something I
think you should see.

261
00:27:06,884 --> 00:27:10,939
If you don't mind,
I will begin at the beginning.

262
00:27:15,307 --> 00:27:17,380
Long before Christ,

263
00:27:17,462 --> 00:27:21,193
the king of Judah was
a man named Josiah.

264
00:27:21,314 --> 00:27:25,410
Boy, when you say "beginning,"
you mean beginning.

265
00:27:26,535 --> 00:27:28,198
At that time,

266
00:27:28,445 --> 00:27:32,661
the temple where the people
worshipped was in ruin,

267
00:27:32,871 --> 00:27:37,660
and so the people worshipped idols,
false gods,

268
00:27:37,798 --> 00:27:40,659
and so the kingdom
was in disarray.

269
00:27:41,165 --> 00:27:45,612
Josiah, since he
was a good king,

270
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:48,304
sent his secretary
to the treasury

271
00:27:48,396 --> 00:27:52,657
and said,
"we must rebuild the temple.

272
00:27:52,849 --> 00:27:56,944
Give all of the gold to the
workers so that this will be done."

273
00:27:57,745 --> 00:28:03,512
But when the secretary returned,
he had no gold.

274
00:28:04,439 --> 00:28:08,081
And when Josiah
asked why this was,

275
00:28:08,618 --> 00:28:11,565
the secretary replied...

276
00:28:16,051 --> 00:28:17,786
"we found a book."

277
00:28:21,123 --> 00:28:23,243
Do you know this story?

278
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,711
No, afraid I don't.

279
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,701
What the secretary had found

280
00:28:29,901 --> 00:28:32,187
was an ancient book,

281
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:36,228
the book of law.

282
00:28:37,137 --> 00:28:41,330
You may know it as
the Old Testament.

283
00:28:41,746 --> 00:28:47,991
And it was with that ancient book,
not with the gold,

284
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:51,415
that Josiah rebuilt the temple.

285
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,724
On the other side
of the island,

286
00:28:59,787 --> 00:29:02,971
we found a place
much like this.

287
00:29:05,071 --> 00:29:10,335
And in this place,
we found a book.

288
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:28,699
I believe what's inside there
will be of great value to you.

289
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:19,614
Hey.

290
00:30:27,375 --> 00:30:33,824
So Rose's husband's white.
Didn't see that one coming.

291
00:30:34,241 --> 00:30:36,041
Is there something
you need, Hurley?

292
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:40,412
No. Just taking a walk,
thought I'd say "hey."

293
00:30:43,777 --> 00:30:45,352
Who's taking care of Sawyer?

294
00:30:45,997 --> 00:30:47,113
Sun is.

295
00:30:47,786 --> 00:30:50,114
So you're, like, mad at him?

296
00:30:53,815 --> 00:30:55,874
Why would I be mad at Sawyer?

297
00:30:55,997 --> 00:30:58,964
Maybe 'cause he's the one
always comes down here and

298
00:30:59,041 --> 00:31:01,954
chops wood and now you are.

299
00:31:02,034 --> 00:31:04,556
It's, like, transference.

300
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:06,848
What are you, a shrink now?

301
00:31:06,957 --> 00:31:10,098
Well, that's what they call
it in the mental hospital.

302
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,653
I'm not mad at anyone.

303
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:26,173
Where's Jack?

304
00:31:27,248 --> 00:31:30,292
I don't know.
He didn't come back.

305
00:31:32,004 --> 00:31:33,416
Has he said anything?

306
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:36,316
Sawyer?

307
00:31:37,518 --> 00:31:40,623
No, he's still sleeping.

308
00:31:43,977 --> 00:31:45,545
Can you watch him?

309
00:31:48,048 --> 00:31:51,546
- I can stay if you--
- No. Yeah, I can.

310
00:31:51,712 --> 00:31:52,544
Thanks.

311
00:32:15,317 --> 00:32:21,956
Uh-huh. Yes, I'm sure that's the
exact form you've got. Uh-huh.

312
00:32:23,554 --> 00:32:26,078
I'll send one over
to you, right.

313
00:32:29,329 --> 00:32:30,998
I'll call you back later.

314
00:32:38,992 --> 00:32:40,068
Hi, dad.

315
00:32:44,282 --> 00:32:47,428
Katie, the police and the U.S.
Marshals are looking for you.

316
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:48,736
You shouldn't have come here.

317
00:32:48,766 --> 00:32:52,189
I've been waiting outside for 2 hours.
They're not here.

318
00:32:53,284 --> 00:32:55,755
Is it true what they're saying?

319
00:33:01,364 --> 00:33:03,359
Katie, what did
you come here for?

320
00:33:06,505 --> 00:33:09,661
Why didn't you tell me, dad?

321
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:11,724
Tell you what?

322
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:17,676
I was making a scrapbook,
a surprise for your birthday,

323
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:23,598
so I called one of your C.O.s to
get some pictures of you in uniform.

324
00:33:23,782 --> 00:33:26,660
The pictures that he sent
me had dates on the back,

325
00:33:26,842 --> 00:33:31,621
photos of you in Korea up until
four months before I was born.

326
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:40,024
Why didn't you tell me
that Wayne was my father?

327
00:33:43,958 --> 00:33:45,145
Why?

328
00:33:54,255 --> 00:33:57,198
I didn't tell you because
I knew you'd kill him.

329
00:34:00,804 --> 00:34:03,746
And your mother...

330
00:34:05,201 --> 00:34:06,768
loved him.

331
00:34:11,928 --> 00:34:13,677
You were 5 years old.

332
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:17,833
I wanted to take you along with me.
She wouldn't let me.

333
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,976
So why didn't you kill him?

334
00:34:28,968 --> 00:34:32,009
Because I don't have
murder in my heart.

335
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:45,025
I'm gonna have to call 'em.

336
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,483
Can I have an hour?

337
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,417
Bye, daddy.

338
00:35:48,891 --> 00:35:50,104
Can you hear me?

339
00:35:54,233 --> 00:35:55,058
Sawyer?

340
00:36:12,347 --> 00:36:13,193
Wayne?

341
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:23,962
I'm probably crazy,

342
00:36:26,512 --> 00:36:27,858
and this doesn't matter,

343
00:36:31,506 --> 00:36:32,929
but maybe you're in there.

344
00:36:33,754 --> 00:36:40,324
Somehow you asked me a question.
You asked me why I...

345
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,441
why I did it.

346
00:36:48,828 --> 00:36:51,625
It wasn't 'cause you
drove my father away

347
00:36:52,516 --> 00:36:54,890
or the way you looked at me

348
00:36:57,786 --> 00:36:59,829
or because you beat her.

349
00:37:04,157 --> 00:37:07,192
It was 'cause I hated that
you were a part of me,

350
00:37:07,313 --> 00:37:10,467
that I would never be good,

351
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:13,402
that I would never
have anything good.

352
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:16,057
And every time that
I look at Sawyer,

353
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,152
every time I feel
something for him,

354
00:37:20,173 --> 00:37:22,145
I see you, Wayne,

355
00:37:22,963 --> 00:37:24,726
and it makes me sick.

356
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:34,052
That's about the sweetest
thing I've ever heard.

357
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,531
Sawyer?

358
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,794
Who the hell is Wayne?

359
00:37:51,376 --> 00:37:52,684
Where am I?

360
00:37:53,542 --> 00:37:54,692
A bunk bed?

361
00:37:58,804 --> 00:38:01,235
Yeah, you're in a bunk bed.

362
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:04,689
Are we saved?

363
00:38:09,444 --> 00:38:11,357
No, Sawyer.

364
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:12,983
Not yet.

365
00:38:27,564 --> 00:38:28,708
Voilà.

366
00:38:30,587 --> 00:38:32,101
What are the odds?

367
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:35,379
- The odds?
- Yeah.

368
00:38:35,817 --> 00:38:41,127
Here, hold this down on the table here,
nice and flat.

369
00:38:43,915 --> 00:38:45,539
I mean, think about it.

370
00:38:45,777 --> 00:38:49,067
Somebody made this film.

371
00:38:49,996 --> 00:38:55,501
Someone else cut
this piece out.

372
00:38:57,098 --> 00:38:58,392
We crash.

373
00:38:58,548 --> 00:39:02,109
Two halves of the same plane fall
on different parts of the island.

374
00:39:02,286 --> 00:39:03,936
You're over there.
I'm over here.

375
00:39:05,519 --> 00:39:09,257
And now here's the missing piece,
right back where it belongs.

376
00:39:11,731 --> 00:39:13,454
What are the odds?

377
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:18,912
Don't mistake
coincidence for fate.

378
00:39:34,483 --> 00:39:36,205
You've gotta be kidding me.

379
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:38,824
Air lock's over this way.

380
00:39:39,005 --> 00:39:39,402
Oh.

381
00:39:40,807 --> 00:39:45,190
Come on, admit it.
We've been rescued.

382
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:50,102
You got it? Sorry.

383
00:39:51,421 --> 00:39:52,891
Watch yourself.

384
00:40:02,137 --> 00:40:04,052
Son of a bitch.

385
00:40:07,255 --> 00:40:08,744
Watch yourself, okay?

386
00:40:12,016 --> 00:40:13,982
Okay.

387
00:40:18,587 --> 00:40:20,029
Home sweet home.

388
00:40:20,782 --> 00:40:21,893
Yeah.

389
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,889
I really thought you
were yanking my chain.

390
00:40:27,426 --> 00:40:29,517
What do you keep smiling at?

391
00:40:29,978 --> 00:40:31,375
You need a haircut.

392
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:34,078
Oh, really?

393
00:40:42,581 --> 00:40:45,227
Maybe you ought to
take me back inside.

394
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:00,552
You see that?

395
00:41:05,292 --> 00:41:08,942
If you mean the big-ass horse standing
in the middle of the jungle, then,

396
00:41:09,056 --> 00:41:09,451
yeah.

397
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:35,091
You know that horse, freckles?

398
00:41:38,994 --> 00:41:40,382
Yeah, I do.

399
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:57,121
Tequila and tonic.
That's your drink, right?

400
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,946
Where's the tonic?

401
00:42:00,413 --> 00:42:02,369
We're running a
little low on mixers.

402
00:42:08,331 --> 00:42:10,711
Sure you want to
waste that on me?

403
00:42:11,687 --> 00:42:13,691
I figured you
could use a drink.

404
00:42:16,113 --> 00:42:17,610
I know I could.

405
00:42:19,404 --> 00:42:22,933
You're gonna try to convince me
that everyone here doesn't hate me?

406
00:42:25,404 --> 00:42:29,504
Only if you're gonna try to convince me
that every woman in the world's
not crazy.

407
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:40,746
When the alarm sounds,

408
00:42:40,977 --> 00:42:44,498
either you or your partner
must input the code.

409
00:42:44,684 --> 00:42:46,473
It is highly
recommended that you

410
00:42:46,553 --> 00:42:49,147
and your partner take
alternating shifts.

411
00:42:49,176 --> 00:42:51,979
In this manner, you will both
still stay as fresh and alert.

412
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:55,005
It is most important that
when the alarm sounds,

413
00:42:55,101 --> 00:42:58,336
the code be entered correctly
and in a timely fashion.

414
00:42:58,406 --> 00:42:59,223
Here it comes.

415
00:42:59,324 --> 00:43:01,853
Do not attempt to
use the computer

416
00:43:02,031 --> 00:43:04,914
for anything else other than
the entering of the code.

417
00:43:05,024 --> 00:43:07,258
This is its only function.

418
00:43:07,444 --> 00:43:11,183
The isolation that attends the
duties associated with station 3,

419
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,773
may tempt you to try and

420
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:16,442
utilize the computer for
communication with the outside world.

421
00:43:16,477 --> 00:43:18,621
This is strictly forbidden.

422
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:21,042
Attempting to use the
computer in this manner

423
00:43:21,052 --> 00:43:24,016
will compromise the
integrity of the project and

424
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:27,880
worse, could lead to
another incident.

425
00:43:28,066 --> 00:43:32,415
I repeat,
do not use the computer for anything

426
00:43:32,496 --> 00:43:34,671
other than entering the code.

427
00:43:35,621 --> 00:43:37,380
Congratulations.

428
00:43:37,555 --> 00:43:39,898
Until your replacements arrive,

429
00:43:40,062 --> 00:43:42,864
the future of the
project is in your hands.

430
00:44:08,494 --> 00:44:12,575
Hello?

431
00:44:24,510 --> 00:44:30,722
Hello?

432
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:34,542
Who is this?

433
00:44:36,957 --> 00:44:43,773
This Michael. Who is this?

434
00:44:50,503 --> 00:44:52,392
Dad?
