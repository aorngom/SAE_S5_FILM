00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:02,999
<i>Close your eyes
and tell me what you see.</i>

2
00:00:09,748 --> 00:00:10,962
The Library.

3
00:00:17,474 --> 00:00:19,088
<i>Open your eyes again.</i>

4
00:00:21,514 --> 00:00:22,672
<i>Where are you now?</i>

5
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:24,466
My living room, Dr Moon.

6
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:26,875
<i>When you close your eyes...</i>

7
00:00:27,244 --> 00:00:28,733
I go to the Library.

8
00:00:30,866 --> 00:00:32,349
Go to the Library now.

9
00:00:34,598 --> 00:00:36,694
<i>- Are you back there?
- Yes.</i>

10
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:38,859
<i>The same part?</i>

11
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,406
<i>No, it's always different.</i>

12
00:00:41,837 --> 00:00:43,703
<i>The Library goes on for ever.</i>

13
00:00:44,917 --> 00:00:46,475
<i>How you do move around?</i>

14
00:00:47,732 --> 00:00:48,902
By wishing.

15
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:54,713
- What's wrong?
- Something's here!

16
00:00:55,132 --> 00:00:57,153
Someone's got in!
No-one's supposed to get in!

17
00:00:57,253 --> 00:00:59,515
She's never mentioned anyone.
She's always been alone.

18
00:00:59,615 --> 00:01:00,929
<i>Someone's in my library.</i>

19
00:01:03,613 --> 00:01:06,098
No! No, please! That's not allowed!

20
00:01:06,198 --> 00:01:07,380
Listen to me.

21
00:01:08,706 --> 00:01:10,433
The Library is in your mind.

22
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:13,113
I know it's in my mind.
But something's got inside!

23
00:01:24,965 --> 00:01:26,629
Oh! Hello!

24
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:28,963
Sorry to burst in on you like this.

25
00:01:29,376 --> 00:01:30,702
OK if we stop here for a bit?

30
00:02:09,772 --> 00:02:13,963
Books! People never
really stop loving books.

31
00:02:15,972 --> 00:02:17,247
51st century.

32
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:21,179
By now you've got holovids,
direct to brain downloads, fiction mist,

33
00:02:21,279 --> 00:02:24,795
but you need the smell.
The smell of books, Donna. Deep breath.

34
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,600
The Library.

35
00:02:33,127 --> 00:02:34,660
So big it doesn't need a name.

36
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,149
Just a great big "the."

37
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:37,725
It's like a city.

38
00:02:37,825 --> 00:02:40,085
It's a world. Literally a world.

39
00:02:40,185 --> 00:02:42,148
The core of the planet
is the index computer,

40
00:02:42,248 --> 00:02:43,545
biggest hard drive ever.

41
00:02:43,645 --> 00:02:46,046
And up here,
every book ever written.

42
00:02:46,146 --> 00:02:47,428
Whole continents of

43
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,914
Jeffrey Archer, Bridget Jones,
Monty Python's Big Red Book.

44
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,552
Brand new editions,
specially printed.

45
00:02:56,996 --> 00:02:58,872
<i>We're near the equator, so...</i>

46
00:03:01,194 --> 00:03:02,946
this must be Biographies!

47
00:03:03,647 --> 00:03:04,925
I love biographies.

48
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:07,125
Yeah, very you.
Always a death at the end.

49
00:03:07,225 --> 00:03:10,170
You need a good death.
Without death, there'd only be comedies.

50
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:12,845
Dying gives us size. Oi!

51
00:03:13,223 --> 00:03:15,165
- Spoilers!
- What?

52
00:03:15,387 --> 00:03:16,844
These books are from your future.

53
00:03:16,944 --> 00:03:19,005
Don't read ahead,
spoil all the surprises.

54
00:03:19,105 --> 00:03:20,112
Like peeking at the end.

55
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:22,884
Isn't travelling with you
one big spoiler?

56
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:27,273
I try to keep you away
from major plot developments.

57
00:03:28,161 --> 00:03:30,558
Which, to be honest,
I seem to be very bad at,

58
00:03:30,658 --> 00:03:32,328
cos... you know what?

59
00:03:32,428 --> 00:03:34,385
This is the biggest
library in the universe.

60
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,307
So where is everyone?

61
00:03:42,244 --> 00:03:43,232
It's silent.

62
00:03:44,283 --> 00:03:45,192
The Library?

63
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:49,864
The planet.

64
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:53,712
<i>The whole planet.</i>

65
00:03:55,989 --> 00:03:57,234
Maybe it's a Sunday.

66
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,393
No, I never land on Sundays.

67
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:02,645
Sundays are boring. Well...

68
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:06,200
Maybe everyone's really,
really quiet.

69
00:04:06,563 --> 00:04:08,036
Yeah, maybe.

70
00:04:08,718 --> 00:04:10,695
But they'd still show up
on the system.

71
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:13,885
Doctor, why are we here?
Really, why?

72
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:16,245
Oh, you know, just passing.

73
00:04:16,345 --> 00:04:18,125
No, seriously.

74
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:21,657
It was all, "Let's hit the beach,"
then suddenly we're in a library.

75
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:23,605
- Why?
- Now, that's interesting.

76
00:04:24,034 --> 00:04:25,767
- What?
- Scanning for life forms.

77
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:28,727
<i>If I do a scan looking for
your basic humanoids, you know,</i>

78
00:04:28,827 --> 00:04:31,987
<i>your book readers, few limbs and
a face, apart from us, I get nothing.</i>

79
00:04:32,694 --> 00:04:34,485
Zippo, nada, see?

80
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:39,678
Nobody home. But if I widen
the parameters to any kind of life...

81
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:46,125
<i>A million million.</i>

82
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,785
Gives up after that.

83
00:04:49,987 --> 00:04:51,792
A million million.

84
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:54,452
<i>But there's nothing here.</i>

85
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:55,866
<i>There's no-one.</i>

86
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,800
<i>And not a sound.</i>

87
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:03,155
A million million life forms,

88
00:05:04,463 --> 00:05:06,025
and silence in the Library.

89
00:05:08,023 --> 00:05:09,574
But there's no-one here.

90
00:05:10,456 --> 00:05:13,285
There's just books.
I mean, it's not the books, is it?

91
00:05:13,576 --> 00:05:15,205
I mean, it can't be
the books, can it?

92
00:05:15,616 --> 00:05:17,785
I mean, books can't be alive?

93
00:05:29,143 --> 00:05:30,305
<i>Welcome!</i>

94
00:05:33,121 --> 00:05:34,992
- That came from in there.
- Yeah!

95
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:53,292
I am Courtesy Node 710/aqua.

96
00:05:53,648 --> 00:05:57,117
Please enjoy the Library and
respect the personal access codes

97
00:05:57,217 --> 00:06:01,991
of all your fellow readers
regardless of species or hygiene taboo.

98
00:06:02,692 --> 00:06:04,087
That face, it looks real.

99
00:06:04,187 --> 00:06:05,775
Yeah, don't worry about it.

100
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,392
But a statue with a real face, though!

101
00:06:09,016 --> 00:06:11,894
- It's a hologram, isn't it?
- No, but really, it's fine.

102
00:06:11,994 --> 00:06:15,585
Additional, There follows a brief
message from the head librarian

103
00:06:15,685 --> 00:06:17,196
for your urgent attention.

104
00:06:17,296 --> 00:06:19,711
It has been edited for tone and content

105
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:23,440
by a Felman Lux Automated
Decency Filter.

106
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,349
Message follows.

107
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:26,264
"Run.

108
00:06:26,602 --> 00:06:27,872
"For God's sake, run.

109
00:06:29,086 --> 00:06:30,781
<i>"Nowhere is safe.</i>

110
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:35,573
"The Library has sealed itself,
we can't... Oh, they're here.

111
00:06:36,325 --> 00:06:40,005
"Arg. Slarg. Snick."
Message ends.

112
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:45,165
<i>Please switch off your mobile comm
units for the comfort of other readers.</i>

113
00:06:45,547 --> 00:06:47,323
So that's why we're here.

114
00:06:48,243 --> 00:06:50,239
Any other messages, same date stamp?

115
00:06:50,402 --> 00:06:52,084
<i>One additional message.</i>

116
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:56,314
This message carries a Felman
Lux coherency warning of...

117
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,735
- Yeah, yeah, fine, just play it.
-  5, 0, 11...

123
00:07:14,742 --> 00:07:15,392
Donna...

124
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:17,138
Yeah?

125
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:20,585
Stay out of the shadows.

126
00:07:22,611 --> 00:07:24,157
Why, what's in the shadows?

127
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:43,430
So...

128
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,282
We weren't just
in the neighbourhood.

129
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,047
Yeah, I kind of, sort of lied a bit.

130
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:51,712
I got a message
on the psychic paper.

131
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:55,915
What do you think, cry for help?

132
00:07:56,891 --> 00:07:59,832
Cry for help, with a kiss?

133
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:02,221
Oh, we've all done that.

134
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:04,685
- Who's it from?
- No idea.

135
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:07,136
- So why did we come here, why did you?
- Donna.

136
00:08:10,807 --> 00:08:12,571
- What's happening?
- Run!

137
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,545
- What, is it locked?
- Jammed! The wood's warped!

138
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:21,136
Sonic it, use the thingy!

139
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:24,688
- I can't, it's wood!
- What, it doesn't do wood?!

140
00:08:24,788 --> 00:08:27,134
If I can vibrate the molecules,
fry the bindings,

141
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:29,962
- I can shatterline the interface.
- Oh, get out of the way!

142
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:41,245
Oh! Hello!

143
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:44,985
Sorry to burst in on you like this.
OK if we stop here for a bit?

144
00:08:47,943 --> 00:08:48,900
What is it?

145
00:08:51,215 --> 00:08:52,512
Security camera.

146
00:08:54,977 --> 00:08:56,385
Switched itself off.

147
00:08:59,812 --> 00:09:02,941
They were in my library.
How can they be in my library?

148
00:09:03,185 --> 00:09:04,125
Who were they?

149
00:09:05,337 --> 00:09:07,150
What's that? What's that noise?

150
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,195
What noise?

151
00:09:11,379 --> 00:09:12,656
Nice door skills, Donna.

152
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,679
Well, you know, boyfriends, sometimes
you need the element of surprise.

153
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:18,143
<i>What was that ?</i>

154
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,114
What was after us?

155
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,635
I mean, did we just run away
from a power cut?

156
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:23,796
Possibly.

157
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:27,737
Are we safe here?

158
00:09:29,052 --> 00:09:30,772
Course we're safe.
There's a little shop.

159
00:09:36,772 --> 00:09:37,652
Gotcha!

160
00:09:39,768 --> 00:09:40,950
No, stop it!

161
00:09:41,977 --> 00:09:43,712
No, no!

162
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:47,760
Ooh, I'm sorry.

163
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,952
I really am, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry. It's alive.

164
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:54,348
You said it was a security camera.

165
00:09:55,143 --> 00:09:56,018
It is.

166
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:58,496
It's an alive one.

167
00:09:58,859 --> 00:09:59,916
Can you hear me?

168
00:10:01,061 --> 00:10:02,272
Are you all right?

169
00:10:05,545 --> 00:10:07,792
- Others are coming.
- Who's coming?

170
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:09,236
Who are the others?

171
00:10:09,662 --> 00:10:11,205
The Library is breached.

172
00:10:11,305 --> 00:10:13,832
- Others are coming.
- What others?

173
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,136
<i>Others?</i>

174
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:17,483
<i>What does it mean, "others"?</i>

175
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,565
Excuse me,
what does it mean, "others"?

176
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,885
That's barely more than a speak
your weight machine, it can't help you.

177
00:10:26,985 --> 00:10:28,293
So why's it got a face?

178
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:31,615
This flesh aspect was donated
by Mark Chambers

179
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:33,723
on the occasion of his death.

180
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:36,285
It's a real face?

181
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,941
It has been actualised
individually for you

182
00:10:39,041 --> 00:10:43,072
<i>from the many facial aspects
saved to our extensive flesh banks.</i>

183
00:10:43,683 --> 00:10:45,392
Please enjoy.

184
00:10:45,827 --> 00:10:48,055
It chose me a dead face
it thought I'd like?

185
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:50,626
That statue's got a real
dead person's face on it!

186
00:10:50,726 --> 00:10:51,805
<i>It's the 51st century.</i>

187
00:10:51,905 --> 00:10:54,685
That's basically
like donating a park bench.

188
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,402
It's donating a face!

189
00:10:57,046 --> 00:10:58,385
No, wait, no!

190
00:10:58,611 --> 00:11:01,144
- Oi! Hands!
- The shadow, look.

191
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:04,109
What about it?

192
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,055
Count the shadows.

193
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,805
One. There,
I counted it, one shadow.

194
00:11:10,905 --> 00:11:11,712
Yeah...

195
00:11:13,517 --> 00:11:15,105
But what's casting it?

196
00:11:24,745 --> 00:11:28,080
Oh! I'm thick!
Look at me, I'm old and thick!

197
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,286
Head's too full of stuff,
I need a bigger head!

198
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:36,485
<i>Power must be going.</i>

199
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:39,412
This place runs on fission cells.
They'll outburn the sun.

200
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:42,634
- Then why's it dark?
- It's not dark.

201
00:11:46,864 --> 00:11:47,991
That shadow.

202
00:11:48,905 --> 00:11:49,749
It's gone.

203
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,183
We need to get back to the TARDIS.

204
00:11:52,371 --> 00:11:52,952
Why?

205
00:11:53,052 --> 00:11:55,685
Because that shadow hasn't gone.
It's moved.

206
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:57,375
Reminder,

207
00:11:57,475 --> 00:11:59,925
the Library has been breached,
others are coming.

208
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,029
Reminder,

209
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:04,005
<i>the Library has been breached,
others are coming.</i>

210
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:05,537
<i>Reminder,</i>

211
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:07,028
<i>the Library has been breached...</i>

212
00:12:28,494 --> 00:12:29,792
Hello, sweetie.

213
00:12:30,146 --> 00:12:31,860
- Get out.
- Doctor?

214
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,592
All of you, turn around,
get back in your rocket and fly away.

215
00:12:34,692 --> 00:12:36,657
Tell your grandchildren
you came here and lived,

216
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:37,840
they won't believe you.

217
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,499
Pop your helmets, everyone.
We've got breathers.

218
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:43,264
How do you know they're not androids?

219
00:12:43,364 --> 00:12:44,748
Cos I've dated androids.

220
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,007
- They're rubbish.
- Who is this?

221
00:12:47,107 --> 00:12:50,045
You said we were the only expedition,
I paid for exclusives.

222
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,411
I lied, I'm always lying.

223
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,587
Bound to be others.

224
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,109
Miss Evangelista,
I want to see the contracts.

225
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:57,618
You came through the north door?
Much damage?

226
00:12:57,718 --> 00:13:00,834
Please, just leave. I'm asking you
seriously and properly, just lea...

227
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:02,365
Did you say expedition?

228
00:13:02,465 --> 00:13:04,970
My expedition, I funded it.

229
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:08,645
Oh, you're not, are you?
Tell me you're not archaeologists.

230
00:13:09,143 --> 00:13:10,666
Got a problem with archaeologists?

231
00:13:10,766 --> 00:13:13,569
I'm a time traveller.
I point and laugh at archaeologists.

232
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:17,285
Professor River Song, archaeologist.

233
00:13:17,511 --> 00:13:18,505
River Song? Lovely name.

234
00:13:18,605 --> 00:13:21,270
As you're leaving, you need
to set up a quarantine beacon.

235
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,253
Code-wall the planet,

236
00:13:22,353 --> 00:13:26,008
the whole planet. Nobody comes here,
not ever again. No-one living thing.

237
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:28,843
Not here, not ever. Stop right there!
What's your name?

238
00:13:28,943 --> 00:13:29,605
Anita.

239
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:31,205
Anita, stay out of the shadows.

240
00:13:31,305 --> 00:13:34,685
Not a foot, not a finger in the shadows
till you're safely back in your ship.

241
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:38,885
Stay in the light.
Find a nice, bright spot and just stand.

242
00:13:39,239 --> 00:13:41,912
If you understand me,
look very, very scared.

243
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:49,912
No, bit more scared than that.

244
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,840
OK, do for now.
You, who are you?

245
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,985
- Dave.
- OK, Dave...

246
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:59,170
Oh, well Other Dave,
because that's Proper Dave

247
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,973
the pilot, he was the first Dave,
so when we...

248
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:04,820
Other Dave, the way you came,
does it look the same as before?

249
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,710
Yeah. Oh, it's a bit darker.

250
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,636
How much darker?

251
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:10,609
Oh, I could see where we came through
just a moment ago. I can't now.

252
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,474
Seal the door. Find another way out.

253
00:14:12,574 --> 00:14:16,002
We're not looking for a way out.
Miss Evangelista?

254
00:14:16,102 --> 00:14:19,543
I'm Mr Lux's personal... everything.

255
00:14:19,837 --> 00:14:22,533
You need to sign these contracts
agreeing that your experiences

256
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,060
inside the Library are...

257
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,499
the intellectual property of
the Felman Lux Corporation.

258
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,086
- Right, give it here.
- Yeah, lovely. Thanks.

259
00:14:33,346 --> 00:14:35,827
My family built this library.
I have rights.

260
00:14:35,927 --> 00:14:39,245
You have a mouth that won't stop.
You think there's danger here?

261
00:14:39,345 --> 00:14:41,821
Something came to this library
and killed everything in it,

262
00:14:41,921 --> 00:14:43,325
killed a whole world.

263
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,525
- Danger? Could be.
- That was 100 years ago.

264
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:49,195
The Library's been silent for 100 years.
Whatever came here is long dead.

265
00:14:49,532 --> 00:14:50,465
Bet your life?

266
00:14:51,679 --> 00:14:52,512
Always.

267
00:14:53,794 --> 00:14:55,061
<i>What do you doing?</i>

268
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:57,338
<i>He said seal the door.</i>

269
00:14:57,438 --> 00:14:59,072
Torch! You're taking orders from him?

270
00:14:59,172 --> 00:15:00,331
Spooky, isn't it?

271
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,512
Almost every species in the universe

272
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:14,005
<i>has an irrational fear of the dark.</i>

273
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:17,128
<i>But they're wrong.
Cos it's not irrational.</i>

274
00:15:19,535 --> 00:15:21,306
It's Vashta Nerada.

275
00:15:22,019 --> 00:15:23,685
<i>What's Vashta Nerada?</i>

276
00:15:24,015 --> 00:15:25,560
It's what's in the dark.

277
00:15:26,943 --> 00:15:28,613
It's what's always in the dark.

278
00:15:30,545 --> 00:15:33,220
- Lights! You got lights?
- What for?

279
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,999
Form a circle, safe area,
big as you can, lights pointing out.

280
00:15:37,099 --> 00:15:39,702
- Do as he says.
- You're not listening to this man?!

281
00:15:39,802 --> 00:15:41,923
Apparently, I am. Unpack the lights.

282
00:15:42,023 --> 00:15:44,605
Other Dave, make sure the door's secure,
then help Anita.

283
00:15:44,705 --> 00:15:47,278
Mr Lux, put your helmet
back on, block the visor.

284
00:15:47,598 --> 00:15:50,272
Proper Dave, I want you
to access the library database,

285
00:15:50,372 --> 00:15:52,910
see what you can find about what
happened a hundred years ago.

286
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:55,285
Pretty Boy, you're with me.

287
00:15:55,894 --> 00:15:57,085
Step into my office.

288
00:15:57,185 --> 00:16:00,261
Professor Song,
why am I the only one wearing my helmet?

289
00:16:00,912 --> 00:16:02,238
I don't fancy you.

290
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,216
Probably, I can help you.

291
00:16:05,948 --> 00:16:07,825
Pretty Boy, with me, I said.

292
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:13,591
- Oh, I'm Pretty Boy?
- Yes.

293
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,392
Ooh, that came out a bit quick!

294
00:16:15,949 --> 00:16:16,957
Pretty?!

295
00:16:19,832 --> 00:16:22,766
Don't let your shadows cross!
Seriously. Don't even let them touch.

296
00:16:22,866 --> 00:16:26,014
- Any of them could be infected.
- How can a shadow be infected?

297
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:27,503
'Scuse me, can I help?

298
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:30,002
- No, we're fine.
- I could just...

299
00:16:30,102 --> 00:16:31,312
you know, hold things.

300
00:16:31,412 --> 00:16:32,952
No, really, we're OK.

301
00:16:33,668 --> 00:16:34,294
éOK.

302
00:16:41,184 --> 00:16:42,373
Couldn't she help?

303
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:45,498
Trust me, I just spent 4 days on
a ship with that woman. She's...

304
00:16:45,598 --> 00:16:48,417
Couldn't tell the difference between
the escape pod and the bathroom.

305
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:49,965
<i>We had to go back for her.</i>

306
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:51,741
Twice.

307
00:17:04,347 --> 00:17:06,149
- Thanks.
- For what?

308
00:17:06,249 --> 00:17:07,838
The usual. For coming when I call.

309
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:09,490
That was you?

310
00:17:09,658 --> 00:17:11,642
You're doing a good job,
like you don't know me.

311
00:17:11,742 --> 00:17:13,191
I'm assuming there's a reason.

312
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:16,638
- A fairly good one, actually.
- OK, shall we do diaries, then?

313
00:17:16,738 --> 00:17:18,177
Where are we this time?

314
00:17:18,745 --> 00:17:21,975
Going by your face,
I'd say it's early days for you, yeah?

315
00:17:22,075 --> 00:17:23,232
So, erm...

316
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:26,138
Crash of the Byzantium...
have we done that yet?

317
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,105
Obviously ringing no bells.

318
00:17:32,149 --> 00:17:36,010
Right, Picnic at Asgard.

319
00:17:36,648 --> 00:17:38,242
Have we done Asgard yet?

320
00:17:40,657 --> 00:17:42,165
Obviously not.

321
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:44,712
Blimey, very early days, then. Hoo!

322
00:17:44,812 --> 00:17:48,394
Life with a time traveller
never knew it could be such hard work.

323
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:54,824
Look at you!

324
00:17:57,464 --> 00:18:00,072
- You're young.
- I'm really not, you know.

325
00:18:00,486 --> 00:18:01,912
No, but you are.

326
00:18:03,589 --> 00:18:04,478
Your eyes.

327
00:18:06,343 --> 00:18:08,376
<i>You're younger
than I've ever seen you.</i>

328
00:18:10,516 --> 00:18:12,387
You've seen me before, then?

329
00:18:15,515 --> 00:18:16,535
Doctor...

330
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:20,070
Please tell me you know who I am?

331
00:18:22,216 --> 00:18:23,148
Who are you?

332
00:18:32,669 --> 00:18:35,810
Sorry, that was me. Trying to get
through into the security protocols,

333
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:37,275
I seem to have set something off.

334
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:40,752
- What is that, is that an alarm?
- Doctor.

335
00:18:41,243 --> 00:18:43,057
- Doctor, that sounds like...
- It is.

336
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:44,358
It's a phone!

337
00:19:02,081 --> 00:19:02,941
Dad!

338
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,211
<i>In a minute.</i>

339
00:19:11,373 --> 00:19:14,682
I'm trying to call up the data core,
it's not responding. Just that noise.

340
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:17,116
- But it's a phone!
- Let me try something.

341
00:19:21,533 --> 00:19:24,530
Dad! The phone,
aren't you going to answer it?

342
00:19:25,606 --> 00:19:26,876
It's not ringing, sweetie.

343
00:19:39,984 --> 00:19:42,411
OK, doesn't like that,
let's try something else.

344
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:55,672
'OK, here it comes.'

345
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:00,331
Hello?

346
00:20:00,594 --> 00:20:03,213
Hello. Are you in my television?

347
00:20:04,145 --> 00:20:06,867
Well, no, I'm...

348
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:10,089
I'm sort of in space.
I was trying to call up

349
00:20:10,189 --> 00:20:12,634
the data core of a triple-grid
security processor.

350
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:15,102
Would you like to speak to my dad?

351
00:20:16,522 --> 00:20:18,318
Your dad or your mum,
that would be lovely.

352
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:23,592
I know you! You were in my library.

353
00:20:23,848 --> 00:20:24,649
YOUR library?

354
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:27,445
The Library's never been
on the television before.

355
00:20:27,545 --> 00:20:28,878
What have you done?

356
00:20:29,773 --> 00:20:33,914
Ah, I... just rerouted the interface...

357
00:20:36,023 --> 00:20:38,050
What happened. Who was that?

358
00:20:50,146 --> 00:20:52,236
Keep working on those lights,
we need those lights!

359
00:20:52,336 --> 00:20:54,244
You heard him, people,
let there be light.

360
00:21:10,273 --> 00:21:13,702
Sorry. Youre not allowed to see
inside the book, its against the rules.

361
00:21:13,896 --> 00:21:15,179
What rules?

362
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:17,021
Your rules.

363
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:46,448
What's that?

364
00:21:48,878 --> 00:21:51,175
- I didnt do that, did you do that?
- Not me.

365
00:21:54,892 --> 00:21:56,152
What's CAL?

366
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:17,061
You all right?

367
00:22:17,386 --> 00:22:19,713
What's that? What's happening?

368
00:22:19,951 --> 00:22:20,952
<i>I don't know.</i>

369
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:25,538
Oh, thanks for... you know...
offering to help with the lights.

370
00:22:26,827 --> 00:22:28,404
They don't want me.

371
00:22:28,798 --> 00:22:30,973
They think I'm stupid cos I'm pretty.

372
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:33,917
Course they don't, nobody thinks that.

373
00:22:34,017 --> 00:22:35,346
No, they're right though.

374
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:37,112
I'm a moron, me.

375
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,619
My dad said I have the IQ of plankton.

376
00:22:39,719 --> 00:22:41,053
And I was pleased.

377
00:22:41,879 --> 00:22:43,631
See, thats funny.

378
00:22:45,902 --> 00:22:47,979
No, I really was pleased.

379
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,563
- Is that funny?
- No, no.

380
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:56,432
What's causing that?

381
00:22:56,692 --> 00:22:58,097
Is it the little girl?

382
00:22:58,197 --> 00:22:59,822
<i>But who is the little girl?</i>

383
00:22:59,922 --> 00:23:01,630
What's she got to do with this place?

384
00:23:06,466 --> 00:23:09,624
How does the data core work?
What's the principle? What's CAL?

385
00:23:09,724 --> 00:23:10,888
Ask Mr Lux.

386
00:23:12,033 --> 00:23:13,002
CAL, what is it?

387
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:16,912
Sorry. You didn't sign your
Personal Experience contracts.

388
00:23:18,031 --> 00:23:20,602
Mr Lux, right now,

389
00:23:20,702 --> 00:23:23,687
you're in more danger than you've
ever been in your whole life.

390
00:23:23,856 --> 00:23:25,432
And you're protecting a patent?

391
00:23:25,532 --> 00:23:28,218
I'm protecting my family's pride.

392
00:23:28,481 --> 00:23:33,192
Well, funny thing, Mr Lux. I don't
want to see everyone in this room dead

393
00:23:33,353 --> 00:23:36,600
because some idiot thinks
his pride is more important.

394
00:23:38,827 --> 00:23:40,782
Then why don't you sign his contract?

395
00:23:44,207 --> 00:23:46,262
I didn't either.
I'm getting worse than you.

396
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:49,733
Ok, ok, ok.

397
00:23:49,833 --> 00:23:52,092
Let's start at the beginning.
What happened here?

398
00:23:52,557 --> 00:23:55,437
On the actual day, a hundred years ago,
what physically happened?

399
00:23:59,241 --> 00:24:01,996
<i>There was a message
from the library. Just one.</i>

400
00:24:02,878 --> 00:24:04,261
The lights are going out.

401
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:08,552
Then the computer sealed the planet and
there was nothing for a hundred years.

402
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:13,392
It's taken 3 generations of my family
to decode the seals and get back in.

403
00:24:13,832 --> 00:24:14,677
Excuse me...

404
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:16,034
<i>Not, just now.</i>

405
00:24:17,843 --> 00:24:20,564
There was one other thing
in the last message...

406
00:24:20,664 --> 00:24:21,936
That's confidential.

407
00:24:22,036 --> 00:24:23,106
I trust this man.

408
00:24:23,206 --> 00:24:25,240
With my life, with everything.

409
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,599
- You've only just met him.
- No, he's only just met me.

410
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:33,321
This might be important actually...

411
00:24:33,527 --> 00:24:34,910
In a moment!

412
00:24:37,344 --> 00:24:39,747
This is a data extract
that came with the message.

413
00:24:40,527 --> 00:24:43,511
4022 saved. No survivors.

414
00:24:45,832 --> 00:24:48,578
4022, that's the exact number of people
who were in the Library

415
00:24:48,678 --> 00:24:50,199
when the planet was sealed.

416
00:24:51,027 --> 00:24:54,226
But how can 4022 people have
been saved if there were no survivors?

417
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,785
That's what were here to find out.

418
00:24:56,885 --> 00:25:00,414
And so far, what we havent
found, are any bodies.

419
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:21,272
Everybody, careful. Stay in the light.

420
00:26:21,372 --> 00:26:22,887
Keep saying. I don't see the point!

421
00:26:22,987 --> 00:26:24,607
- Who screamed?
- Miss Evangelista.

422
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:25,889
Where is she?

423
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,821
Miss Evangelista,
please state your current...

424
00:26:35,258 --> 00:26:36,809
Please state your current...

425
00:26:39,185 --> 00:26:40,379
position.

426
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:52,205
It's her.

427
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,167
It's Miss Evangelista.

428
00:26:58,267 --> 00:27:00,437
<i>We heard her scream a few seconds ago.</i>

429
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,499
What could do that to a
person in a few seconds?

430
00:27:02,599 --> 00:27:05,017
- It took less than a few seconds.
- What did?

431
00:27:05,117 --> 00:27:05,934
<i>Hello?</i>

432
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:11,113
Erm, I'm sorry everyone
this isn't going to be pleasant.

433
00:27:12,357 --> 00:27:13,488
She's ghosting.

434
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:14,852
She's what?

435
00:27:15,597 --> 00:27:17,902
<i>Hello, excuse me?</i>

436
00:27:18,877 --> 00:27:21,355
<i>I'm sorry, hello, excuse me?</i>

437
00:27:22,075 --> 00:27:25,147
That's. That's her.
That's Miss Evangelista!

438
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:28,187
I don't want to sound horrible,
but couldn't we just. You know?

439
00:27:28,287 --> 00:27:30,487
This is her last moment... no, we cant.

440
00:27:30,587 --> 00:27:32,247
A little respect, thank you.

441
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:35,517
<i>Sorry, where am I? Excuse me?</i>

442
00:27:35,617 --> 00:27:37,617
But that's Miss Evangelista.

443
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:40,912
It's a Data Ghost,
she'll be gone in a moment.

444
00:27:42,107 --> 00:27:45,535
Miss Evangelista,
you're fine, just relax.

445
00:27:45,807 --> 00:27:47,277
We'll be with you presently.

446
00:27:47,846 --> 00:27:49,191
What's a Data Ghost?

447
00:27:49,887 --> 00:27:51,694
There's a neural relay
in the communicator.

448
00:27:51,794 --> 00:27:53,189
Let's you send thought mails.

449
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:55,742
<i>That's it there, those green lights.</i>

450
00:27:56,905 --> 00:27:59,774
<i>Sometimes it can hold an impression
of a living consciousness</i>

451
00:27:59,874 --> 00:28:01,605
<i>for a short time after death.</i>

452
00:28:02,531 --> 00:28:03,714
Like an after image.

453
00:28:05,272 --> 00:28:07,146
My grandfather lasted a day.

454
00:28:08,446 --> 00:28:10,498
Kept talking about his shoelaces.

455
00:28:12,887 --> 00:28:14,120
She's in there!

456
00:28:14,396 --> 00:28:17,685
<i>I can't see, I can't... Where am I?</i>

457
00:28:17,785 --> 00:28:20,919
She's just brain waves now.
The pattern won't hold for long.

458
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:25,548
She's conscious! She's thinking.

459
00:28:25,648 --> 00:28:27,217
<i>I can't see, I can't...</i>

460
00:28:28,024 --> 00:28:29,379
<i>I don't know what I'm thinking.</i>

461
00:28:29,479 --> 00:28:31,604
She's a footprint on the beach.

462
00:28:32,147 --> 00:28:33,556
And the tides coming in.

463
00:28:33,969 --> 00:28:35,360
<i>Where is that woman?</i>

464
00:28:36,107 --> 00:28:37,875
<i>The nice woman... is she there?</i>

465
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:40,409
What woman?

466
00:28:42,017 --> 00:28:46,787
She means... I think she means me.

467
00:28:46,887 --> 00:28:49,311
<i>Is she there? The nice woman?</i>

468
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:53,099
Yes, she's here, hang on.

469
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:57,003
Go ahead. She can hear you.

470
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:58,388
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

471
00:28:59,947 --> 00:29:00,728
Help her.

472
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:04,278
- She's dead.
- Yeah. Help her.

473
00:29:05,467 --> 00:29:08,745
<i>Hello? Is that the nice woman?</i>

474
00:29:09,287 --> 00:29:13,223
Yeah. Hello.
Yeah, I'm I'm... I'm here.

475
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:14,991
You OK?

476
00:29:16,114 --> 00:29:19,232
<i>What I said before...
about being stupid...</i>

477
00:29:19,863 --> 00:29:21,957
<i>don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

478
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:24,657
Course I won't.
Course I won't tell them.

479
00:29:24,757 --> 00:29:27,032
<i>Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

480
00:29:27,865 --> 00:29:31,061
I won't tell them. I said I won't.

481
00:29:31,447 --> 00:29:33,726
<i>Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

482
00:29:35,446 --> 00:29:36,960
I'm not going to tell them.

483
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,093
Don't tell the others...

484
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:40,383
She's looping now.
The patterns degrading.

485
00:29:40,483 --> 00:29:44,432
<i>I can't think, I... don't know, I...</i>

486
00:29:45,732 --> 00:29:46,405
<i>I...</i>

487
00:29:47,346 --> 00:29:48,019
<i>I...</i>

488
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:49,832
<i>Ice cream.</i>

489
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:51,852
<i>Ice cream.</i>

490
00:29:52,647 --> 00:29:53,642
<i>Ice cream.</i>

491
00:29:54,386 --> 00:29:55,381
<i>Ice cream.</i>

492
00:29:56,038 --> 00:29:56,837
<i>Ice cream.</i>

493
00:29:56,937 --> 00:29:58,919
- Doe's anybody mind if I.
-  Ice cream.

494
00:29:59,695 --> 00:30:00,746
<i> Ice cream.</i>

495
00:30:01,422 --> 00:30:02,310
<i> Ice cream.</i>

496
00:30:03,242 --> 00:30:04,352
<i> Ice cream.</i>

497
00:30:07,969 --> 00:30:08,707
<i>Was...</i>

498
00:30:09,977 --> 00:30:11,153
<i>That was horrible.</i>

499
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:13,631
That was the most horrible
thing I've ever seen.

500
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:18,767
No. It's just a freak of technology.

501
00:30:20,767 --> 00:30:24,899
But whatever did this to her,
whatever killed her...

502
00:30:25,707 --> 00:30:27,257
I'd like a word with that.

503
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:28,516
I'll introduce you.

504
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,661
- I'm going to need a packed lunch.
- Hang on.

505
00:30:43,389 --> 00:30:45,785
- What's in that book?
- Spoilers.

506
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:47,239
Who are you?

507
00:30:48,359 --> 00:30:50,627
- Professor River Song, University of...
- To me.

508
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:54,340
- Who are you to me?
- Again... spoilers.

509
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:58,588
Chicken, and a bit of salad.
Knock yourself out.

510
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:05,858
Right, you lot.
Let's all meet the Vashta Nerada!

511
00:31:11,151 --> 00:31:12,767
Darling, Dr Moon is going now.

512
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:15,417
But hed like a word with
you alone, is that all right?

513
00:31:15,517 --> 00:31:18,304
- Yes, of course, Dr Moon.
- Thank you.

514
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:23,208
Now,

515
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:25,154
listen.

516
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,633
This is important.

517
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:33,764
There's the realworld, and
there's the world of nightmares.

518
00:31:33,864 --> 00:31:35,687
That's right, Isn't there?
You understand?

519
00:31:35,787 --> 00:31:37,412
Yes, I know, Dr Moon.

520
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,112
What I want you to remember is this...

521
00:31:41,212 --> 00:31:42,431
<i>and I know its hard.</i>

522
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:48,872
The real world is a lie,
and your nightmares are real.

523
00:31:49,535 --> 00:31:51,027
The Library is real.

524
00:31:51,127 --> 00:31:55,177
There are people trapped in
there, people who need to be saved.

525
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,986
The shadows are moving again.

526
00:31:58,737 --> 00:32:01,672
<i>Those people are depending on you.</i>

527
00:32:02,299 --> 00:32:03,912
Only you can save them.

528
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:06,153
<i>Only you.</i>

529
00:32:14,594 --> 00:32:16,432
You travel with him, don't you?

530
00:32:17,485 --> 00:32:19,351
The Doctor, you travel with him.

531
00:32:20,008 --> 00:32:20,946
What of it?

532
00:32:21,622 --> 00:32:23,186
<i>Proper Dave, could you move over a bit?</i>

533
00:32:23,286 --> 00:32:23,893
Why?

534
00:32:23,993 --> 00:32:26,033
Just over there by the water cooler.
Thanks.

535
00:32:29,545 --> 00:32:30,891
You know him, don't you?

536
00:32:30,991 --> 00:32:32,755
Oh, God, do I know that man.

537
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,265
<i>We go way back, that man and me.</i>

538
00:32:37,075 --> 00:32:38,545
<i>Just not this far back.</i>

539
00:32:38,758 --> 00:32:39,912
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

540
00:32:40,907 --> 00:32:42,334
He hasn't met me yet.

541
00:32:44,868 --> 00:32:48,090
I sent him a message but
it went wrong, it arrived too early.

542
00:32:49,023 --> 00:32:51,394
This is the Doctor in the
days before he knew me.

543
00:32:54,197 --> 00:32:57,997
And he looks at me,
and he looks right through me.

544
00:32:58,097 --> 00:33:00,289
And it shouldn't kill me, but it does.

545
00:33:00,721 --> 00:33:03,555
What are you talking about?
Are you just talking rubbish?

546
00:33:03,655 --> 00:33:05,417
Do you know him or don't you?

547
00:33:05,517 --> 00:33:08,769
- Donna, quiet, I'm working!
- Sorry!

548
00:33:09,007 --> 00:33:11,590
Donna? You're Donna? Donna Noble?

549
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,605
Yeah, why?

550
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,012
I do know the Doctor.

551
00:33:17,767 --> 00:33:19,058
But in the future.

552
00:33:19,647 --> 00:33:21,304
His personal future.

553
00:33:22,099 --> 00:33:23,707
So why don't you know me?

554
00:33:24,517 --> 00:33:25,809
Where am I in the future?

555
00:33:28,521 --> 00:33:30,561
<i>OK! We've got a live one.</i>

556
00:33:32,413 --> 00:33:36,110
That's not darkness down those
tunnels, this is not a shadow.

557
00:33:36,892 --> 00:33:38,072
It's a swarm.

558
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:40,287
A man-eating swarm.

559
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:47,253
The piranhas of the air,
the Vashta Nerada.

560
00:33:47,966 --> 00:33:50,369
Literally the shadows
that melt the flesh.

561
00:33:51,038 --> 00:33:53,829
Most planets have them,
but usually in small clusters.

562
00:33:54,216 --> 00:33:57,477
I've never seen an infestation
on this scale, or this aggressive.

563
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,462
What d'you mean, most planets?
Not Earth?

564
00:33:59,562 --> 00:34:02,540
Mmmm, Earth, and a billion other worlds.

565
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:04,711
Where there's meat,
there's Vashta Nerada.

566
00:34:04,874 --> 00:34:06,802
<i>You can see them sometimes, if you look.</i>

567
00:34:07,665 --> 00:34:09,147
The dust in sunbeams.

568
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,264
If they were on Earth, we'd know.

569
00:34:13,364 --> 00:34:15,662
Nah, normally they live on road kill.

570
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:18,195
<i>But sometimes people go missing.</i>

571
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:21,799
Not everyone comes back out of the dark.

572
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:23,207
Every shadow?

573
00:34:23,388 --> 00:34:26,251
No. But any shadow.

574
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,028
So what do we do?

575
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,155
Daleks: aim for the eyestalk.

576
00:34:30,255 --> 00:34:32,151
Sontarans: back of the neck.

577
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:37,427
Vashta Nerada: Run! Just run.

578
00:34:37,597 --> 00:34:38,691
Run where?

579
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:41,387
This is an index point.
There must be an exit teleport.

580
00:34:41,487 --> 00:34:43,747
Don't look at me, I haven't
memorised the schematics!

581
00:34:43,847 --> 00:34:44,778
Doctor,

582
00:34:44,878 --> 00:34:47,510
little shop! They always make you
go through it on the way out

583
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:49,168
so they can sell you stuff.

584
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:52,666
You're right! Brilliant!
That's why I like the little shop!

585
00:34:52,766 --> 00:34:53,604
OK, let's move it.

586
00:34:53,704 --> 00:34:56,627
<i>Actually, Proper Dave, could you
stay where you are for a moment?</i>

587
00:34:56,801 --> 00:34:57,527
Why?

588
00:34:59,229 --> 00:35:02,248
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

589
00:35:05,063 --> 00:35:06,623
But you've got two shadows.

590
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:17,725
<i>It's how they hunt, they latch on
to a food source and keep it fresh.</i>

591
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:21,573
- What do I do?
- You stay absolutely still.

592
00:35:21,673 --> 00:35:24,112
Like there's a wasp in the room,
a million wasps.

593
00:35:24,212 --> 00:35:26,153
- We're not leaving you, Dave.
- Of course not.

594
00:35:26,253 --> 00:35:28,211
Where's your helmet?
Don't point, tell me.

595
00:35:28,847 --> 00:35:30,585
On the floor, by my bag.

596
00:35:31,092 --> 00:35:32,702
Don't cross his shadow!

597
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,081
Thanks.

598
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:44,457
Now, the rest of you,
helmets back on and sealed up.

599
00:35:44,557 --> 00:35:47,189
- We'll need everything we've got.
- We haven't any helmets.

600
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:49,618
- Yeah, we're safe anyway.
- How are we safe?

601
00:35:49,824 --> 00:35:51,332
That was a clever lie to shut you up.

602
00:35:51,432 --> 00:35:53,337
Professor, anything
I can do with the suit?

603
00:35:53,437 --> 00:35:57,032
What good are suits? Miss Evanglista
was wearing one, there was nothing left.

604
00:35:57,132 --> 00:36:00,600
We can increase the mesh-density
dial it up 400%. Make it a tougher meal.

605
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,319
<i>OK.</i>

606
00:36:03,672 --> 00:36:05,955
- 800%! Pass it on.
- Gotcha!

607
00:36:06,218 --> 00:36:08,151
- What's that?
- It's a screwdriver.

608
00:36:09,579 --> 00:36:12,113
- It's sonic.
- Yeah, I know. Snap!

609
00:36:19,317 --> 00:36:20,595
With me, come on!

610
00:36:25,167 --> 00:36:27,147
Are we shopping?
Is it a good time to shop?

611
00:36:27,247 --> 00:36:29,548
No talking, just moving!
Stand up in the middle!

612
00:36:29,648 --> 00:36:31,143
Its a teleport, stand in the middle.

613
00:36:31,243 --> 00:36:32,933
Can't send the others,
TARDIS won't recognise them.

614
00:36:33,033 --> 00:36:35,192
- What you doing?
- You don't have suit, not safe!

615
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:37,988
You don't have a suit, you're
in just as much danger as I am...

616
00:36:38,088 --> 00:36:39,578
Donna! Let me explain.

617
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:42,792
- Oh, that's how you do it!
- Doctor!

618
00:36:55,837 --> 00:36:56,819
Where did it go?

619
00:36:57,451 --> 00:37:00,586
It's just gone. I looked round,
one shadow. See.

620
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:02,477
Does that mean we can leave?

621
00:37:02,577 --> 00:37:05,427
I don't know why we're still here.
We can leave him, can't we?

622
00:37:05,527 --> 00:37:08,277
- I mean, no offence.
- Shut up, Mr Lux.

623
00:37:08,377 --> 00:37:11,137
Did you feel anything?
Like an energy transfer?

624
00:37:11,237 --> 00:37:13,541
No, no, but, look, it's gone.

625
00:37:13,641 --> 00:37:15,637
Stop there, stop moving.

626
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,152
They're never just gone.
And they never give up.

627
00:37:21,608 --> 00:37:23,591
Well, this ones benign.

628
00:37:24,192 --> 00:37:25,934
<i>Hey, who turned out the lights?</i>

629
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:27,487
No-one, they're fine.

630
00:37:27,587 --> 00:37:29,519
<i>No, seriously, turn them back on!</i>

631
00:37:30,095 --> 00:37:31,101
They are on.

632
00:37:31,937 --> 00:37:33,540
<i>I can't see a ruddy thing.</i>

633
00:37:33,915 --> 00:37:35,980
Dave, turn round.

634
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,312
What's going on? Why can't I see?

635
00:37:38,777 --> 00:37:40,973
Is the power gone, are we safe here?

636
00:37:41,073 --> 00:37:43,637
Dave, I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

637
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,959
Dave, Dave? Dave,
can you hear me, are you all right?

638
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,517
Talk to me, Dave.

639
00:37:49,874 --> 00:37:52,677
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm... fine.

640
00:37:52,777 --> 00:37:55,277
I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

641
00:37:55,377 --> 00:37:58,517
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm... fine.

642
00:38:00,417 --> 00:38:03,535
I can't. Why can't I? I...

643
00:38:05,543 --> 00:38:08,639
I can't. Why can't I? I...

644
00:38:10,078 --> 00:38:13,200
I can't. Why can't I?

645
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:15,033
I...

646
00:38:15,307 --> 00:38:16,927
He's gone. He's ghosting.

647
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:19,087
Then why is he still standing?

648
00:38:20,126 --> 00:38:21,683
Who turned out the lights?

649
00:38:23,366 --> 00:38:24,967
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

650
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:26,194
Doctor, don't!

651
00:38:26,547 --> 00:38:27,927
Dave, can you hear me?

652
00:38:28,534 --> 00:38:30,105
Who turned out the lights?

653
00:38:33,834 --> 00:38:35,342
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

654
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:38,158
- Who turned out the lights?
- Scuse me!

655
00:38:40,074 --> 00:38:42,070
Back from it, get back, right back!

656
00:38:47,864 --> 00:38:50,827
- Doesn't move very fast does it?
- It's a swarm in a suit.

657
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:52,314
But it's learning.

658
00:38:57,967 --> 00:38:59,167
What do we do? Where do we go?

659
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:00,912
See that wall behind you?

660
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:02,888
DUCK!

661
00:39:04,212 --> 00:39:05,485
Squareness gun!

662
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,627
Everybody out. Go, go, go!

663
00:39:08,727 --> 00:39:10,377
Move it, move, move!

664
00:39:11,253 --> 00:39:12,867
Move it, move, move!

665
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,102
- You said not every shadow.
- But any shadow!

666
00:39:19,463 --> 00:39:20,927
Who turned out the lights?

667
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:21,752
Run!

668
00:39:36,287 --> 00:39:37,853
Sweetie, dinner's ready.

669
00:39:39,486 --> 00:39:41,317
Donna Noble has been saved.

670
00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:44,257
Sweetie?

671
00:40:07,384 --> 00:40:08,886
<i>Trying to boost the power.</i>

672
00:40:09,157 --> 00:40:11,217
Light doesn't stop them,
but it slows them down.

673
00:40:11,317 --> 00:40:14,895
So, what's the plan? Do we have a plan?

674
00:40:15,702 --> 00:40:17,091
Your screwdriver...

675
00:40:20,007 --> 00:40:23,267
- Looks exactly like mine.
- Yeah. You gave it to me.

676
00:40:23,431 --> 00:40:25,296
I don't give my screwdriver to anyone.

677
00:40:25,396 --> 00:40:26,541
I'm not anyone.

678
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:29,913
- Who are you?
- What's the plan?

679
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:32,912
I teleported Donna back to the TARDIS.

680
00:40:33,255 --> 00:40:36,089
If we don't get back in five hours,
emergency program one activates.

681
00:40:36,189 --> 00:40:37,307
Take her home.

682
00:40:37,485 --> 00:40:39,599
- We need to get a shift on.
- She's not there.

683
00:40:40,552 --> 00:40:41,903
I should've received a signal,

684
00:40:42,154 --> 00:40:44,152
console signals me if
there's a teleport breach.

685
00:40:44,252 --> 00:40:46,809
Maybe the co-ordinates slipped.
The equipment here's aged.

686
00:40:47,857 --> 00:40:48,892
Donna Noble.

687
00:40:48,992 --> 00:40:52,907
There's a Donna Noble in this library,
do you have the software to locate her?

688
00:40:53,447 --> 00:40:55,600
Donna Noble has left the Library.

689
00:40:56,188 --> 00:40:59,587
- Donna Noble has been saved.
- Donna!

690
00:41:00,443 --> 00:41:02,607
<i>Donna Noble has left the Library.</i>

691
00:41:03,183 --> 00:41:04,616
<i>Donna Noble has been saved.</i>

692
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:07,562
How can it be Donna?
