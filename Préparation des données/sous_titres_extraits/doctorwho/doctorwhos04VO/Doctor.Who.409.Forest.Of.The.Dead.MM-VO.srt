00:00:00,438 --> 00:00:03,091
<i>The Library!
So big it doesn't need a name.</i>

2
00:00:03,191 --> 00:00:05,480
Someone's got in.
Someone's in my library.

3
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,295
4,022 saved.

4
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:08,515
No survivors.

5
00:00:08,615 --> 00:00:11,141
- Others are coming.
- What... others?

6
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:19,537
Professor River Song, archaeologist.

7
00:00:19,637 --> 00:00:21,168
You've seen me before, then?

8
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:25,643
The real world is a lie,
and your nightmares are real.

9
00:00:26,785 --> 00:00:28,962
- What's CAL?!
- The Library is real.

10
00:00:29,244 --> 00:00:33,187
There are people trapped in there,
people who need to be saved.

11
00:00:33,556 --> 00:00:35,527
There's a neural relay
in the communicator.

12
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,390
<i>Sometimes it can hold an impression</i>

13
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,068
<i>of a living consciousness
for a short time after death.</i>

14
00:00:40,168 --> 00:00:43,562
The shadows are moving again.
Only you can save them.

15
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:46,220
The piranhas of the air,
the Vashta Nerada.

16
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,950
Donna Noble has been saved.

17
00:00:51,448 --> 00:00:53,331
Donna Noble has been saved.

18
00:00:53,431 --> 00:00:56,470
<i>- Who turned out the lights?
- Donna Noble has left the Library.</i>

19
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:59,199
<i>Donna Noble has been saved.
Who turned out the lights?</i>

20
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:03,150
Donna Noble has left the Library.
Donna Noble has been saved.

00:01:48,515 --> 00:01:50,317
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

28
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:53,045
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

29
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,722
This way, quickly, move!

30
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,554
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

31
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,990
Dad, the Library,
it's on television now.

32
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,920
How many times, darling?

33
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:07,684
The Library is just
your imagination.

34
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:40,910
Donna?

35
00:02:54,976 --> 00:02:55,870
Hello, Donna.

36
00:02:56,871 --> 00:02:57,832
Who are you?

37
00:02:57,932 --> 00:02:59,262
I'm Dr Moon.

38
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,603
I've been treating you since
you came here two years ago.

39
00:03:03,861 --> 00:03:07,510
Oh, God, Dr Moon, I'm so sorry!

40
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:09,433
What's wrong with me?

41
00:03:09,877 --> 00:03:11,391
I didn't know you for a moment.

42
00:03:11,804 --> 00:03:15,230
And then you remembered.
Shall we go for a walk?

43
00:03:15,558 --> 00:03:16,991
No more dreams, then?

44
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:21,487
The Doctor and the blue box,
time and space.

45
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,465
How did we get here?

46
00:03:25,785 --> 00:03:28,400
We came down the stairs,
out the front door.

47
00:03:29,007 --> 00:03:30,973
We passed Mrs Ali on the way out.

48
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:34,858
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

49
00:03:35,647 --> 00:03:38,162
- I forgot that.
- And then you remembered.

50
00:03:40,864 --> 00:03:42,678
Shall we go down to the river?

51
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,084
You said "river" and suddenly
we're feeding ducks.

52
00:03:47,184 --> 00:03:48,159
Dr Moon!

53
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:50,901
Morning.

54
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:54,055
Donna Noble, Lee McAvoy.

55
00:03:55,644 --> 00:03:56,495
Hello, Lee.

56
00:03:56,689 --> 00:03:57,577
Hello...

57
00:03:59,490 --> 00:03:59,892
D...

58
00:03:59,992 --> 00:04:03,430
Ooh, you've got bit
of a stammer there... Bless!

59
00:04:04,054 --> 00:04:05,261
D... D...

60
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:08,314
Oh, skip to a vowel, they're easy!

61
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,990
How did we leave it, him and me?

62
00:04:11,318 --> 00:04:15,070
I got the impression he was
inviting you fishing tomorrow.

63
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,070
So...

64
00:04:21,203 --> 00:04:22,230
Fishing!

65
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:26,939
D... D...

66
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:31,181
Gorgeous and can't speak a word.

67
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,166
What am I going to do with you?

68
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:38,670
Welcome home, M-Mrs McAvoy.

69
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:46,710
Stop it!
Stop it now, we've got a visitor.

70
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,806
You've done so much
in seven years, Donna.

71
00:04:49,438 --> 00:04:51,434
Sometimes it feels more like 70.

72
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,865
Mind you, sometimes
it feels like no time at all.

73
00:04:57,956 --> 00:05:01,430
Can I just say what a pleasure
it is to see you fully integrated?

74
00:05:05,273 --> 00:05:07,707
<i>No, the signal's definitely
coming from the moon.</i>

75
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,065
<i>I'm blocking it,
but it's trying to break through.</i>

76
00:05:10,528 --> 00:05:12,662
- Donna!
- Oops, sorry.

77
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:15,070
Mrs Angelo's rhubarb surprise.

78
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:16,555
Will I never learn?

79
00:05:18,532 --> 00:05:19,746
The Doctor!

80
00:05:20,584 --> 00:05:22,192
I saw the Doctor!

81
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:26,310
Yes, you did, Donna,
and then... you forgot.

82
00:05:28,339 --> 00:05:31,033
Dr Moon! Oh, hello!

83
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:33,310
Shall I make you a cup of tea?

84
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:54,503
OK, we've got a clear spot.
In, in, in!

85
00:05:55,335 --> 00:05:57,719
Right in the centre,
in the middle of the light, quickly!

86
00:05:57,819 --> 00:05:59,915
Don't let your shadows cross.
Doctor...

87
00:06:00,015 --> 00:06:01,291
I'm doing it.

88
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:05,975
There's no lights here.
Sunset's coming, we can't stay long.

89
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,570
Have you found a live one?

90
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:11,675
Maybe, it's getting harder to tell.
What's wrong with you?

91
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:15,150
We're going to need a chicken leg.
Who's got a chicken leg?

92
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,910
Thanks, Dave.

93
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:25,027
OK... OK, we've got a hot one.
Watch your feet.

94
00:06:25,127 --> 00:06:27,248
They won't attack
until there's enough of them,

95
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:29,710
but they've got our scent now,
they're coming.

96
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,911
Who is he?

97
00:06:33,411 --> 00:06:36,508
You haven't even told us.
You just expect us to trust him.

98
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:39,960
- He is the Doctor.
- And who is the Doctor?

99
00:06:40,789 --> 00:06:44,086
The only story you'll
ever tell, if you survive him.

100
00:06:45,043 --> 00:06:48,548
You say he's your friend,
but he doesn't even know who you are.

101
00:06:48,648 --> 00:06:50,444
Listen, all you need to know is this...

102
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,690
I'd trust that man
to the end of the universe,

103
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:54,217
and actually we've been.

104
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:00,035
He doesn't act like he trusts you.

105
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:02,275
Yeah, there's a tiny problem.

106
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,283
He hasn't met me yet.

107
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:11,051
What's wrong with it?

108
00:07:11,151 --> 00:07:13,915
There's a signal coming from somewhere,
interfering with it.

109
00:07:14,015 --> 00:07:16,635
- Use the red settings.
- It doesn't have a red setting.

110
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,610
- Well, use the dampers.
- It doesn't have dampers.

111
00:07:20,085 --> 00:07:21,280
It will do one day.

112
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:27,476
So, some time in the future,
I just give you my screwdriver.

113
00:07:27,576 --> 00:07:29,453
- Yeah.
- And why would I do that?

114
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:31,635
I didn't pluck it
from your cold dead hands,

115
00:07:31,735 --> 00:07:34,473
- if that's what you're worried about.
- I know that because...?

116
00:07:35,124 --> 00:07:36,147
Listen to me.

117
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,794
You've lost your friend,
you're angry, I understand.

118
00:07:38,894 --> 00:07:40,959
But you need to be
less emotional, Doctor.

119
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:42,689
Less em... I'm not emotional.

120
00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:45,980
There are five people in this room
still alive, focus on that.

121
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:49,321
- Dear God, you're hard work young.
- Young? Who are you?!

122
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:51,862
Oh, for heaven's sake!
Look at the pair of you!

123
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:53,589
We're all going to die right here,

124
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:56,204
and you're just squabbling
like an old married couple.

125
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:01,060
Doctor...

126
00:08:02,338 --> 00:08:05,998
one day I'm going to be someone
that you trust completely,

127
00:08:06,755 --> 00:08:09,113
but I can't wait
for you to find that out.

128
00:08:10,152 --> 00:08:11,998
So I'm going to prove it to you.

129
00:08:12,874 --> 00:08:13,825
And I'm sorry.

130
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:19,074
I'm really very sorry.

131
00:08:31,357 --> 00:08:32,290
Are we good?

132
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:37,270
Doctor... are we good?

133
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:40,842
Yeah...

134
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:43,140
Yeah, we're good.

135
00:08:47,836 --> 00:08:48,530
Good.

136
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:58,919
What's interesting about my screwdriver?

137
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:01,590
Very hard to interfere with,
nothing's strong enough...

138
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:03,767
Well, some hairdryers,
but I'm working on that.

139
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:06,131
There is a very strong signal
coming from somewhere,

140
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:09,028
and it wasn't there before,
so what's new, what's changed?

141
00:09:09,942 --> 00:09:11,179
Come on! What's new?

142
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,744
- What's different?
- I dunno, nothing.

143
00:09:14,489 --> 00:09:15,884
It's getting dark.

144
00:09:16,197 --> 00:09:18,656
It's a screwdriver,
it works in the dark.

145
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:20,895
Moonrise.

146
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:26,438
Tell me about the moon. What's there?

147
00:09:26,538 --> 00:09:28,678
It's not real,
it was built as part of the Library.

148
00:09:28,778 --> 00:09:29,723
Just a doctor moon.

149
00:09:29,823 --> 00:09:31,880
- What's a doctor moon?
- A virus checker.

150
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,515
It supports and maintains the main
computer at the core of the planet.

151
00:09:35,615 --> 00:09:38,221
Well, it's still active,
it's signalling, look.

152
00:09:39,516 --> 00:09:43,090
Someone somewhere in this Library is
alive and communicating with the moon.

153
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:46,087
or possibly alive and drying their hair.

154
00:09:46,187 --> 00:09:49,081
No, the signal's definitely
coming from the moon.

155
00:09:49,581 --> 00:09:51,340
I'm blocking it,
trying to break through.

156
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,184
Doctor!

157
00:09:52,772 --> 00:09:53,612
Donna!

158
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:55,789
That was her, that was your friend.

159
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,703
Can you get her back? What was that?

160
00:09:58,135 --> 00:10:01,590
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
I'm trying to find the wavelength.

161
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,517
- I'm being blocked.
- Professor?

162
00:10:03,798 --> 00:10:05,790
- Just a moment.
- It's important.

163
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,086
I have two shadows.

164
00:10:10,418 --> 00:10:12,230
OK. Helmets on, everyone.

165
00:10:12,542 --> 00:10:14,106
Anita, I'll get yours.

166
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,510
- It didn't do Proper Dave any good.
- Just keep it together, OK?

167
00:10:18,985 --> 00:10:20,593
I'm keeping it together,

168
00:10:21,112 --> 00:10:22,614
I'm only crying.

169
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,164
I'm about to die,
it's not an overreaction.

170
00:10:30,718 --> 00:10:31,630
Hang on.

171
00:10:33,452 --> 00:10:36,855
- Oh, God, they've got inside.
- No, no, no, I just tinted her visor.

172
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:39,890
Maybe they'll think they're already
in there, leave her alone.

173
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:41,686
You think they can
be fooled like that?

174
00:10:41,786 --> 00:10:43,068
Maybe. I don't know.

175
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:45,174
It's a swarm, it's not like we chat.

176
00:10:45,274 --> 00:10:47,642
- Can you still see in there?
- Just about.

177
00:10:47,742 --> 00:10:49,568
Just... Just stay back.

178
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,714
Professor, a quick word, please.

179
00:10:51,814 --> 00:10:53,065
- What?
- Down here.

180
00:10:53,165 --> 00:10:53,878
What is it?

181
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,842
Like you said, there are five people
still alive in this room.

182
00:10:56,942 --> 00:10:57,806
Yeah, so?

183
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:58,558
So...

184
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:01,616
why are there six?

185
00:11:05,918 --> 00:11:08,630
- Hey! Who turned out the lights?
- Run!

186
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:11,392
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

187
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:20,332
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?
Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

188
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:21,932
<i>Here we are, Dr Moon.</i>

189
00:11:22,032 --> 00:11:23,184
Mummy, I made you!

190
00:11:23,284 --> 00:11:26,387
Ooh, that's nice, Ella.
Where's the face?

191
00:11:26,487 --> 00:11:27,782
I don't know.

192
00:11:28,877 --> 00:11:31,314
Did you see Dr Moon?
Did he leave?

193
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:32,769
Daddy!

194
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:35,815
Hello, you two, come here!
Big hugs, big Daddy hugs!

195
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:37,705
Look what I made!

196
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,570
- Oh, it's Mummy.
- It hasn't got a face.

197
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:42,169
Did you see Dr Moon?

198
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,772
- No, why, was he here?
- Yeah, just a second ago.

199
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:46,455
You must have passed him.

200
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,184
Are you all right?

201
00:11:52,135 --> 00:11:52,917
Yeah.

202
00:11:53,987 --> 00:11:55,323
Yeah, I'm fine, it's just...

203
00:11:55,992 --> 00:11:56,774
Just...

204
00:11:59,379 --> 00:12:00,522
Nothing.

205
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:05,045
It's been a long day, that's all.

206
00:12:06,296 --> 00:12:07,390
I'm just tired.

207
00:12:10,532 --> 00:12:11,483
Are you OK?

208
00:12:12,378 --> 00:12:15,379
I said I was tired and...

209
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:18,294
..and we put the kids to bed,

210
00:12:18,595 --> 00:12:20,507
and we watched television.

211
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:24,775
Was that a letter?

212
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:27,179
- It's midnight.
- Go and see what it is.

213
00:12:43,861 --> 00:12:46,418
- "The world is wrong."
- What?

214
00:12:46,774 --> 00:12:48,265
For you. Weird, though.

215
00:12:48,691 --> 00:12:51,297
"Dear Donna, the world is wrong.

216
00:12:52,092 --> 00:12:54,925
"Meet me at your usual playpark,
two o'clock tomorrow."

217
00:13:06,638 --> 00:13:07,429
Nutter.

218
00:13:11,293 --> 00:13:13,045
Don't go. Please don't go.

219
00:13:21,227 --> 00:13:23,460
All right, you two,
off you go, no fighting.

220
00:13:44,723 --> 00:13:46,454
I got your note last night.

221
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,135
The world is wrong,
what's that mean?

222
00:13:49,235 --> 00:13:51,617
- No, you didn't.
- I'm sorry, what?

223
00:13:51,717 --> 00:13:53,699
You didn't get my note last night.

224
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,596
You got it a few seconds ago.

225
00:13:56,602 --> 00:14:00,036
Having decided to come,
you suddenly found yourself arriving.

226
00:14:00,937 --> 00:14:04,030
That is how time progresses here,
in the manner of a dream.

227
00:14:04,696 --> 00:14:07,901
You've suspected that before,
haven't you, Donna Noble?

228
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:13,999
- How do you know me?
- We met before, in the Library.

229
00:14:14,865 --> 00:14:16,201
<i>You were kind to me.</i>

230
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:18,970
<i>I hope now to return that kindness.</i>

231
00:14:21,371 --> 00:14:22,452
Your voice...

232
00:14:24,249 --> 00:14:26,356
- I recognise it.
- Yes, you do.

233
00:14:27,859 --> 00:14:30,382
I am what is left of Miss Evangelista.

234
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:43,577
Professor, go ahead, find a safe spot.

235
00:14:43,677 --> 00:14:46,205
It's a carnivorous swarm in a suit,
you can't reason with it.

236
00:14:46,305 --> 00:14:47,191
Five minutes.

237
00:14:47,726 --> 00:14:50,679
Other Dave, stay with him, pull him
out when he's too stupid to live.

238
00:14:50,779 --> 00:14:52,402
Two minutes, Doctor.

239
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,455
<i>Hey! Who turned out the lights?</i>

240
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,360
You hear that? Those words?

241
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,927
That is the very last thought
of the man who wore that suit

242
00:15:00,027 --> 00:15:02,995
before you climbed inside it
and stripped his flesh.

243
00:15:03,441 --> 00:15:04,717
That's a man's soul

244
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,625
trapped inside a neural relay,
going round and round forever.

245
00:15:07,725 --> 00:15:10,398
If you don't have the decency
to let him go, how about this?

246
00:15:10,498 --> 00:15:12,492
Use him. Talk to me.

247
00:15:13,748 --> 00:15:15,759
It's easy, neural relay.
Just point and think.

248
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:18,879
- Use him, talk to me.
- Hey! Who turned out the lights?

249
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:23,352
The Vashta Nerada live on all the worlds
in this system, but you hunt in forests.

250
00:15:23,546 --> 00:15:25,793
- What you doing in a library?
- We should go. Doctor!

251
00:15:25,893 --> 00:15:26,430
In a minute.

252
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:29,179
You came to a library to hunt, why?
Just tell me why?

253
00:15:35,052 --> 00:15:37,042
We... did not.

254
00:15:37,586 --> 00:15:39,082
Oh, hello.

255
00:15:40,157 --> 00:15:41,828
We did not.

256
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,762
Take it easy, you'll get the hang of it.
Did not what?

257
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:49,079
We... did not... come... here.

258
00:15:49,179 --> 00:15:51,335
Well, of course you did,
of course you came here.

259
00:15:51,567 --> 00:15:53,825
We come from here.

260
00:15:54,796 --> 00:15:55,615
From here?

261
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,760
We hatched here.

262
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,258
But you hatch from trees,
from spores in trees.

263
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:04,237
These are our forests.

264
00:16:04,456 --> 00:16:06,606
You're nowhere near a forest,
look around you.

265
00:16:06,706 --> 00:16:10,034
These are our forests.

266
00:16:10,134 --> 00:16:12,637
You're not in a forest,
you're in a library.

267
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,714
There are no trees in a...

268
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,821
library.

269
00:16:16,921 --> 00:16:18,486
<i>We should go. Doctor!</i>

270
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:20,194
Books.

271
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,465
You came in the books.

272
00:16:25,399 --> 00:16:28,490
Microspores in a million, million books.

273
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,954
<i>We should go. Doctor!</i>

274
00:16:30,054 --> 00:16:31,649
Oh, look at that.

275
00:16:32,375 --> 00:16:34,483
<i>The forests of the Vashta Nerada,</i>

276
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:37,430
<i>pulped and printed and bound.</i>

277
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,994
A million, million books,
hatching shadows.

278
00:16:42,094 --> 00:16:43,594
<i>We should go. Doctor!</i>

279
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:46,986
Oh...

280
00:16:47,878 --> 00:16:50,862
Dave! Oh, Dave, I'm so sorry.

281
00:16:52,814 --> 00:16:55,379
- Hey! Who turned out the lights?
- We should go. Doctor!

282
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:58,590
I'm stupid, I talk too much,
this gob doesn't stop for anything.

283
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,843
Want to know the only
reason I'm still alive?

284
00:17:01,644 --> 00:17:03,352
Always stay near the door.

285
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,915
<i>I suggested we meet here</i>

286
00:17:25,015 --> 00:17:27,688
because a playground
is the easiest place to see it,

287
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:28,983
to see the lie.

288
00:17:29,202 --> 00:17:32,355
- What lie?
- The children, look at the children.

289
00:17:33,682 --> 00:17:35,366
Why do you wear that veil?

290
00:17:36,011 --> 00:17:38,295
If I had a face like yours,
I wouldn't hide it.

291
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:40,219
You remember my face, then?

292
00:17:42,618 --> 00:17:47,162
The memories are all still there,
the Library, the Doctor, me.

293
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:49,583
You've just been
programmed not to look.

294
00:17:52,061 --> 00:17:54,230
Sorry, but... you're dead.

295
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:57,549
In a way, we're all dead here, Donna.

296
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,895
We are the dead of the Library.

297
00:18:00,058 --> 00:18:02,360
Well, what about the children?

298
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,150
The children aren't dead.
My children aren't dead.

299
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,270
Your children were never alive.

300
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:10,852
Don't you say that. Don't you dare
say that about my children!

301
00:18:10,952 --> 00:18:12,572
Look at your children.

302
00:18:12,672 --> 00:18:15,750
Look at all of them, really look.
They're not real.

303
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:18,550
<i>Do you see it now?
They're all the same.</i>

304
00:18:20,964 --> 00:18:23,755
<i>All the children of this world,
the same boy and the same girl,</i>

305
00:18:23,855 --> 00:18:25,420
<i>over and over again.</i>

306
00:18:25,839 --> 00:18:26,527
Stop it.

307
00:18:27,171 --> 00:18:30,594
Just stop it! Why are you doing this?
Why are you wearing that veil?

308
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:58,194
You know... it's funny,
I keep wishing the Doctor was here.

309
00:18:58,294 --> 00:19:00,348
<i>The Doctor is here, isn't he?</i>

310
00:19:00,892 --> 00:19:02,744
He's coming back, right?

311
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:08,421
You know when you see a photograph
of someone you know,

312
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:10,950
but it's from years
before you knew them?

313
00:19:11,956 --> 00:19:15,855
It's like they're not quite...
finished, they're not done yet.

314
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:20,742
Well... yes, the Doctor's here.

315
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:24,074
He came when I called,
just like he always does.

316
00:19:25,576 --> 00:19:28,729
But not MY Doctor.

317
00:19:32,189 --> 00:19:33,740
Now my Doctor...

318
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:39,699
I've seen whole armies
turn and run away.

319
00:19:40,597 --> 00:19:44,623
And he'd just swagger off
back to his TARDIS

320
00:19:45,255 --> 00:19:48,094
and open the doors with
a snap of his fingers.

321
00:19:50,252 --> 00:19:53,380
The Doctor... in the TARDIS...

322
00:19:54,579 --> 00:19:58,190
- Next stop, everywhere.
- Spoilers!

323
00:20:00,804 --> 00:20:03,544
Nobody can open a TARDIS
by snapping their fingers.

324
00:20:04,426 --> 00:20:06,829
- It doesn't work like that.
- It does for the Doctor.

325
00:20:07,604 --> 00:20:08,818
I am the Doctor.

326
00:20:09,031 --> 00:20:10,710
Yeah. Some day.

327
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:15,676
- How are you doing?
- Where's Other Dave?

328
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,353
Not coming, sorry.

329
00:20:19,436 --> 00:20:20,800
Well, if they've taken him,

330
00:20:21,163 --> 00:20:23,426
- why haven't they gotten me yet?
- I don't know.

331
00:20:24,477 --> 00:20:26,538
<i>Maybe tinting your
visor's making a difference.</i>

332
00:20:26,638 --> 00:20:28,246
<i>It's making a difference all right.</i>

333
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:30,712
No-one's ever going
to see my face again.

334
00:20:31,744 --> 00:20:35,049
- Can I get you anything?
- An old age would be nice.

335
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:37,408
Anything you can do?

336
00:20:37,508 --> 00:20:39,914
- I'm all over it.
- Doctor...

337
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:42,980
When we first met you...

338
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,333
you didn't trust Professor Song.

339
00:20:47,234 --> 00:20:50,335
And then she whispered a word
in your ear, and you did.

340
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,893
My life so far...

341
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:55,834
I could do with a word like that.

342
00:20:56,747 --> 00:20:58,299
What did she say?

343
00:21:02,047 --> 00:21:04,957
Give a dead girl a break.
Your secrets are safe with me.

344
00:21:05,784 --> 00:21:06,597
Safe.

345
00:21:07,029 --> 00:21:07,873
What?

346
00:21:09,944 --> 00:21:12,582
Safe. You don't say saved,
nobody says saved,

347
00:21:12,682 --> 00:21:14,988
you say safe.
The data fragment! What did it say?

348
00:21:15,088 --> 00:21:18,680
- "4,022 people saved. No survivors."
- Doctor?

349
00:21:20,927 --> 00:21:23,454
Nobody says saved,
nutters say saved, you say safe.

350
00:21:23,554 --> 00:21:28,670
But you see, it didn't mean safe,
it meant... it literally meant... saved!

351
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,361
What happened to your face?

352
00:21:32,461 --> 00:21:34,031
Transcription errors.

353
00:21:34,675 --> 00:21:37,935
It destroyed my face,
did wonders for my intellect.

354
00:21:38,035 --> 00:21:40,075
I'm a very poor copy of myself.

355
00:21:40,456 --> 00:21:41,803
<i>Where are we?</i>

356
00:21:42,353 --> 00:21:44,274
Why are the children all the same?

357
00:21:44,374 --> 00:21:48,391
The same pattern over and over.
It saves an awful lot of space.

358
00:21:48,669 --> 00:21:49,495
Space?

359
00:21:52,127 --> 00:21:53,053
Cyberspace.

360
00:21:53,153 --> 00:21:55,277
No! Don't tell, you mustn't tell!

361
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:57,603
<i>See, there it is, right there!</i>

362
00:21:57,703 --> 00:21:59,461
A hundred years ago,
massive power surge,

363
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:00,695
all teleports going at once.

364
00:22:00,795 --> 00:22:03,269
Soon as Vashta Nerada hit
their hatching cycle, they attack.

365
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:05,832
Someone hits the alarm,
computer tries to teleport everyone.

366
00:22:05,932 --> 00:22:07,802
It tried to teleport 4022 people?

367
00:22:07,902 --> 00:22:09,655
It succeeded, pulled 'em all out, but...

368
00:22:09,755 --> 00:22:11,845
nowhere to send them,
nowhere safe in the Library.

369
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:13,484
Vashta Nerada growing in every shadow,

370
00:22:13,584 --> 00:22:16,450
4022 people, all beamed up
and nowhere to go.

371
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:20,464
They're stuck in the system,
waiting to be sent, like emails.

372
00:22:20,919 --> 00:22:22,608
So what's a computer to do?

373
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:24,560
What does a computer always do?

374
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,093
It saved them.

375
00:22:29,463 --> 00:22:31,653
The Library, a whole world of books,

376
00:22:31,753 --> 00:22:34,619
and right at the core,
the biggest hard drive in history.

377
00:22:34,719 --> 00:22:37,259
Index to everything ever written,
backup of every single book.

378
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:42,190
The computer saved 4022 people
the only way a computer can.

379
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:45,230
It saved them to the hard drive.

380
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:49,230
Your physical self is stored
in the library as an energy signature.

381
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:53,180
It can be actualised again
whenever you or the Library requires.

382
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,590
The Library?

383
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,803
If my face ends up on
one of those statues...

384
00:22:58,903 --> 00:23:00,511
You remember the statues?

385
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:07,040
Wait, no, just... hang on. So...

386
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,261
this isn't the real me?

387
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:11,590
This isn't my real body.

388
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,600
But I've been dieting!

389
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,248
What you see around you,

390
00:23:15,348 --> 00:23:19,450
this entire world is nothing
more than virtual reality.

391
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,764
So why do you look like that?

392
00:23:25,105 --> 00:23:26,481
I had no choice.

393
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,070
You teleported.
You're a perfect reproduction.

394
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:34,343
I was just a data ghost caught in
the Wi-Fi and automatically uploaded.

395
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,910
And it made you clever?

396
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,949
Were only strings of numbers in here.

397
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:42,308
I think a decimal point
may have shifted in my IQ.

398
00:23:42,465 --> 00:23:44,792
But my face has been
the bigger advantage.

399
00:23:45,605 --> 00:23:48,946
I have the two qualities
you require to see absolute truth.

400
00:23:49,046 --> 00:23:52,230
I am brilliant... and unloved.

401
00:23:55,293 --> 00:23:56,870
If this is all a dream...

402
00:23:59,366 --> 00:24:00,410
whose dream is it?

403
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,311
It's hard to see everything in
the data core, even for me, but...

404
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:05,170
there is a word.

405
00:24:06,064 --> 00:24:07,003
<i>just one word.</i>

406
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:09,838
CAL.

407
00:24:14,557 --> 00:24:16,015
<i>Mummy! My knee!</i>

408
00:24:17,429 --> 00:24:19,225
Oh, look at that knee!

409
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:21,377
Oh, look at that silly old knee!

410
00:24:21,771 --> 00:24:24,398
She's not real. They're fictions.

411
00:24:24,917 --> 00:24:28,650
I'm sorry, but now that you understand
that, you won't be able to keep a hold.

412
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,855
They are sustained only by your belief.

413
00:24:30,955 --> 00:24:32,680
You don't know, you don't have children.

414
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,153
Neither do you.

415
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,439
Donna, for your own sake, let them go!

416
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:41,380
Stop it! You'll spoil everything!

417
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,410
I hate you, you're going
to ruin everything! Stop it!

418
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,986
Sweetie, what's wrong?

419
00:24:46,970 --> 00:24:48,630
Shut up!

420
00:24:50,916 --> 00:24:52,947
Daddy! No! Daddy!

421
00:25:00,224 --> 00:25:01,894
What is it? What's wrong?

422
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:06,448
<i>Autodestruct enabled in 20 minutes.</i>

423
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,515
Mummy, what did the lady mean?

424
00:25:10,615 --> 00:25:11,954
<i>Are we not real?</i>

425
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:14,790
- Where are we going?
- Home!

426
00:25:15,885 --> 00:25:17,875
That was quick, wasn't it, Mummy?

427
00:25:18,325 --> 00:25:21,830
Mummy, what's wrong with the sky?

428
00:25:25,959 --> 00:25:27,160
What's maximum erasure?

429
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,240
20 minutes, this planet'll
crack like an egg.

430
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:32,760
No! No, it's all right,
the Doctor Moon will stop it.

431
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,440
It's programmed to protect CAL.

432
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,270
<i>Now, you really must
stop this, you know.</i>

433
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,716
You've forgotten again it was you who
saved all those people, haven't you?

434
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,280
And then you remembered.

435
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,670
Shut up, Dr Moon!

436
00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:51,251
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

437
00:25:52,364 --> 00:25:55,031
<i>All Library systems
are permanently offline,</i>

438
00:25:55,594 --> 00:25:58,190
<i>sorry for any inconvenience. Shortly.</i>

439
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,100
We need to stop this,
we've got to save CAL.

440
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,788
But what is it, what is CAL?

441
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:05,320
We need to get to the main
computer. I'll show you.

442
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,110
- It's at the core of the planet.
- Well, then...

443
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,086
let's go.

444
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,347
Gravity platform!

445
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:23,266
- I bet I like you.
- Oh, you do!

446
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:34,880
Mummy, you're hurting my hand.

447
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:40,417
You just... You just
stay where I can see you.

448
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,521
You don't get out of my sight.

449
00:26:44,415 --> 00:26:45,835
Is it bedtime?

450
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:55,759
OK.

451
00:26:58,018 --> 00:27:01,503
That was lovely, wasn't it?
That was a lovely bedtime.

452
00:27:01,772 --> 00:27:03,224
We had warm milk,

453
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:07,566
and we watched cartoons, and then
Mummy read you a lovely bedtime story.

454
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:12,470
Mummy, Joshua and me,
we're not real, are we?

455
00:27:12,947 --> 00:27:14,336
Of course you’re real.

456
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:18,591
You're as real as anything.
Why do you say that?

457
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:23,890
But, Mummy, sometimes, when you're
not here, it's like we're not here.

458
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,710
Even when you close
your eyes. We just stop.

459
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:34,070
Well, Mummy promises
to never close her eyes again.

460
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,049
No! Please!

461
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,280
NO PLEASE! No! No, no!

462
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,868
No, no !

463
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:55,950
No, no !

464
00:28:01,624 --> 00:28:05,090
<i>Autodestruct in 15 minutes.</i>

465
00:28:05,484 --> 00:28:09,000
The Data Core! Over 4000
living minds, trapped inside it.

466
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:12,199
Yeah, well they won't be living much
longer, we're running out of time.

467
00:28:14,038 --> 00:28:16,850
Help me. Please help me.

468
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,270
Please, please help me!

469
00:28:24,868 --> 00:28:27,139
<i>Help me. Please, help me.</i>

470
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,660
What's that? Was that a child?

471
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,270
Computer's in sleep mode.

472
00:28:33,352 --> 00:28:35,139
I can't wake it up. I'm trying.

473
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:46,070
Doctor, these readings!

474
00:28:46,589 --> 00:28:49,470
I know, you'd think it was... dreaming.

475
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:53,750
It is dreaming... of a normal life,
and a lovely Dad,

476
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,790
and of every book ever written.

477
00:28:56,718 --> 00:28:58,240
Computer's don't dream.

478
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,470
<i>Help me. Please help me.</i>

479
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:03,112
No. But little girls do.

480
00:29:14,754 --> 00:29:17,150
Please help me. Please help me.

481
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,603
Oh, my God! It's the little girl.

482
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,075
<i>The girl we saw in the computer.</i>

483
00:29:24,788 --> 00:29:26,390
<i>She's not in the computer.</i>

484
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:29,837
<i>In a way, she is the computer.</i>

485
00:29:30,682 --> 00:29:31,959
<i>The main command node.</i>

486
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:33,990
This is CAL.

487
00:29:35,131 --> 00:29:38,340
CAL is a child! A child
hooked up to a mainframe?

488
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,520
Why didn't you tell me
this! I needed to know this!

489
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,437
Because she's family!

490
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,459
CAL...

491
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,819
Charlotte Abigail Lux.

492
00:29:50,995 --> 00:29:53,134
My grandfathers youngest daughter.

493
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,825
<i>She was dying,</i>

494
00:29:57,939 --> 00:30:00,990
<i>so he built her a Library,
and put her living mind inside,</i>

495
00:30:01,797 --> 00:30:03,561
with a moon to watch over her,

496
00:30:04,256 --> 00:30:06,020
and all of human history
to pass the time,

497
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,423
<i>any era to live in, any book to read.</i>

498
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,980
<i>She loved books more than anything.</i>

499
00:30:13,575 --> 00:30:15,246
He gave her them all.

500
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,140
He asked only that she be left in peace.

501
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,332
A secret,

502
00:30:21,172 --> 00:30:22,230
not a freak show.

503
00:30:22,836 --> 00:30:26,470
So you weren't protecting a patent,
you were protecting her.

504
00:30:29,947 --> 00:30:32,218
This is only half a life, of course.

505
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,360
But it's for ever.

506
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,936
And then the shadows came.

507
00:30:37,267 --> 00:30:39,834
<i>Shadows. I have to...</i>

508
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,780
I have to save.

509
00:30:43,369 --> 00:30:44,401
Have to save...

510
00:30:45,171 --> 00:30:46,341
And she saved them.

511
00:30:47,617 --> 00:30:50,030
<i>She saved everyone in the Library,</i>

512
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,897
folded them into her
dreams and kept them safe.

513
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:55,690
<i>Then why didn't she tell us?</i>

514
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,413
<i>Because she's forgotten.</i>

515
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,946
She's got 4000 living minds chatting
away inside her head, it must be like...

516
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,689
being... well, me.

517
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,060
So what do we do?

518
00:31:08,170 --> 00:31:10,169
- Autodestruct in ten minutes.
- Easy!

519
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:13,210
We beam all people out of data core,
computer'll reset and stop countdown.

520
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:16,240
Charlotte doesn't have enough
memory space left to make the transfer.

521
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,720
Easy! I'll hook myself to the computer
and she can borrow my memory space!

522
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,180
It'll kill you stone dead.

523
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:24,110
- Yeah, it's easy to criticise.
- It'll burn out both your hearts.

524
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:26,390
I'll try my hardest not to die.
It's my main thing.

525
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,261
- Doctor!
- Shut up now!

526
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:29,969
You and Luxy-boy,
back to the main Library.

527
00:31:30,069 --> 00:31:32,005
Prime data cells you can
find for max download,

528
00:31:32,105 --> 00:31:35,443
and before you say anything else,
Professor, can I just mention, shut up!

529
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
- I hate you sometimes!
- I know!

530
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,010
Mr Lux, with me! Anita,
if he dies, I'll kill him!

531
00:31:43,274 --> 00:31:44,840
What about the Vashta Nerada?

532
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,170
These are their forests.

533
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:48,920
I'll seal Charlotte inside her world,
take everybody else away.

534
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,190
The shadows can swarm
to their hearts content.

535
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:53,148
<i>So you think they're
just gonna let us go?</i>

536
00:31:53,248 --> 00:31:55,920
- Best offer they're gonna get.
- You're gonna make em an offer?

537
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:57,172
They'd better take it,

538
00:31:57,272 --> 00:32:00,830
cos right now, I'm finding it very hard
to make any kind of offer at all.

539
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:03,303
I really liked Anita.

540
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:08,220
She was brave, even when she was crying,
and she never gave in. And you ate her.

541
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,189
But I'm gonna let that pass.

542
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,672
Just as long as you let them pass.

543
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:16,338
How long have you known?

544
00:32:16,438 --> 00:32:17,915
I counted the shadows.

545
00:32:19,736 --> 00:32:21,175
You only have one now.

546
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,143
She's nearly gone. Be kind.

547
00:32:26,318 --> 00:32:29,330
These are our forests. We are not kind.

548
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,574
I'm giving you back your forests,
but you are giving me them.

549
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,130
You are letting them go.

550
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,584
These are our forests.
They are our meat.

551
00:32:42,563 --> 00:32:44,036
Don't play games with me.

552
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:49,060
You just killed someone I like,
that is not a safe place to stand.

553
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:52,863
I'm the Doctor, and you're in the
biggest Library in the universe.

554
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,361
Look me up.

555
00:33:08,476 --> 00:33:10,150
You have one day.

556
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:15,950
Anita!

557
00:33:16,050 --> 00:33:18,827
I'm sorry. She's been dead
a while now. I told you to go.

558
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,990
Lux can manage without me.

559
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,351
But you can't.

560
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:31,910
<i>Autodestruct in two minutes.</i>

561
00:33:36,069 --> 00:33:38,800
Oh, no, no, no, no, come on,
what are you doing? That's my job.

562
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,020
Oh, and I'm not allowed to have
a career, I suppose?

563
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,720
Why am I handcuffed?
Why do you even have handcuffs?

564
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:44,830
Spoilers!

565
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:47,322
Stop this now, this is gonna kill you!

566
00:33:47,422 --> 00:33:48,798
I'd have a chance, you don't have.

567
00:33:48,898 --> 00:33:50,919
You wouldn't have a chance,
and neither do I.

568
00:33:52,455 --> 00:33:54,276
I'm timing it for the end
of the countdown,

569
00:33:54,376 --> 00:33:55,861
there'll be a blip in command flow.

570
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:58,226
It should improve our chances
of a clean download.

571
00:33:58,326 --> 00:33:59,452
River! Please! No!

572
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,062
Funny thing is, this means you've
always known how I was going to die.

573
00:34:03,869 --> 00:34:06,559
All the time we've been together,
you knew I was coming here.

574
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:11,670
The last time I saw you,
the real you, the future you, I mean,

575
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:16,109
you turned up on my doorstep,
with a new haircut and a suit.

576
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,109
<i>You took me to Darillium
to see the singing towers.</i>

577
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:24,108
What a night that was!

578
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:28,047
The towers sang and you cried.

579
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:31,640
<i>- Autodestruct in one minute.
- You wouldn't tell me why,</i>

580
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,886
<i>but I suppose you knew
it was time. My time.</i>

581
00:34:35,174 --> 00:34:37,230
<i>Time to come to the Library.</i>

582
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:41,185
You even gave me your screwdriver,
that should've been a clue.

583
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,710
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

584
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:45,520
You can let me do this!

585
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,090
If you die here,
it'll mean I've never met you.

586
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,320
Time can be rewritten.

587
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,670
Not those times.
Not one line! Don't you dare!

588
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:59,270
It's OK. It's OK, it's not over for you.
You'll see me again.

589
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,807
You've got all of that to come.

590
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,355
You and me, time and space.

591
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,472
You watch us run!

592
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:11,913
River, you know my name!

593
00:35:12,013 --> 00:35:13,230
<i>Autodestruct in...</i>

594
00:35:13,330 --> 00:35:15,418
You whispered my name in my ear.

595
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:18,630
<i>Nine, eight, seven...</i>

596
00:35:18,730 --> 00:35:21,472
There's only one reason I would
ever tell anyone my name.

597
00:35:22,367 --> 00:35:23,743
There's only one time I could...

598
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,070
Shh, now!

599
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:26,916
<i>Three.</i>

600
00:35:27,016 --> 00:35:28,111
Spoilers!

601
00:35:28,211 --> 00:35:30,669
<i>Two, one...</i>

602
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:39,824
Donna? What's happening?

603
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,130
I don't know, but it's not real.
Nothing here's real.

604
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:46,472
The whole world,
everything, none of it's real.

605
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,243
Am I real?

606
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:54,116
Course you're real, I know you're real.

607
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:59,031
Oh, God, oh, God, I hope you're real.

608
00:36:05,045 --> 00:36:09,262
I'll find you!
I promise you, I'll find you!

609
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,073
<i>Excuse me.</i>

610
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,118
What happened? How did we get here?

611
00:36:24,463 --> 00:36:25,708
Look at you.

612
00:36:26,703 --> 00:36:27,710
You're back.

613
00:36:28,261 --> 00:36:30,783
You're all back. He did it!

614
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,820
You're all back. Look at you!

615
00:36:47,143 --> 00:36:48,419
Look at that!

616
00:36:50,246 --> 00:36:52,179
Look at that. He did it.

617
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,078
<i>4,022 people! Saved!</i>

618
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,130
<i>Please be patient.</i>

619
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,520
<i>Only three can teleport at a time.</i>

620
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,180
<i>Do not state your intended
destination until you arrive in...</i>

621
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,373
Any luck?

622
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,427
There wasn't even anyone called
Lee in the Library that day.

623
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:37,112
Suppose he could have had
a different name out here, but...

624
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,003
let's be honest,

625
00:37:40,073 --> 00:37:41,463
he wasn't real, was he?

626
00:37:42,406 --> 00:37:43,414
Maybe not.

627
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:46,761
I made up the perfect man.

628
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,040
Gorgeous, adores me,
and hardly able to speak a word.

629
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,153
- What does that say about me?
- Everything.

630
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,090
Sorry, did I say everything?
I meant to say nothing.

631
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,115
I was aiming for nothing,
I accidentally said everything.

632
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,955
<i>Stand right in the middle
of the teleport, please...</i>

633
00:38:04,975 --> 00:38:06,045
What about you?

634
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:08,516
Are you all right?

635
00:38:09,063 --> 00:38:10,430
I'm always all right.

636
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:15,795
Is all right special
Time Lord code for...

637
00:38:16,515 --> 00:38:17,990
really not all right at all?

638
00:38:18,654 --> 00:38:19,311
Why?

639
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,415
Cos I'm all right, too.

640
00:38:28,403 --> 00:38:29,129
Come on.

641
00:38:55,318 --> 00:38:56,407
Your friend.

642
00:38:57,383 --> 00:38:58,910
Professor Song...

643
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,714
She knew you in the future,
but she didn't know me.

644
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,091
What happens to me?

645
00:39:05,573 --> 00:39:07,557
When she heard my name,
when she looked at me...

646
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:08,470
Donna...

647
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:11,023
This is her diary.

648
00:39:14,121 --> 00:39:15,185
My future.

649
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:20,452
I could look you up.

650
00:39:22,592 --> 00:39:23,730
What do you think?

651
00:39:26,195 --> 00:39:27,841
Shall we peek at the end?

652
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:36,910
Spoilers, right?

653
00:39:38,393 --> 00:39:39,310
Right.

654
00:39:53,243 --> 00:39:56,638
Come on. The next chapter's this way.

655
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,754
<i>When you run with The Doctor,
it feels like it will never end.</i>

656
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,281
<i>But however hard you try,
you can't run for ever.</i>

657
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:13,817
<i>Everybody knows that everybody dies,
and nobody knows it like The Doctor.</i>

658
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,160
<i>But I do think that all the skies
of all the worlds might just turn dark,</i>

659
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:24,350
<i>if he ever, for one moment accepts it.</i>

660
00:40:24,450 --> 00:40:26,604
Why? Why would I give
her my screwdriver?

661
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:28,043
Why would I do that?

662
00:40:28,431 --> 00:40:31,760
Thing is, future me had years to think
about it, to think of a way to save her,

663
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:34,978
and what he did was give her
a screwdriver! Why would I do that?

664
00:40:39,445 --> 00:40:42,610
Look at that! I'm very good!

665
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:44,110
<i>What have you done?</i>

666
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:45,972
Saved her.

667
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,850
Stay with me! You can
do it, stay with me!

668
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:57,497
Come on, you and me, one last run!

669
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,550
Sorry, River, shortcut!

670
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,395
<i>Platform disabled.</i>

671
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:19,234
<i>Everybody knows that everybody dies.</i>

672
00:41:22,757 --> 00:41:24,562
<i>But not every day.</i>

673
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:28,726
<i>Not today.</i>

674
00:41:52,853 --> 00:41:55,119
It's OK. You're safe.

675
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,540
You'll always be safe here.

676
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,580
The Doctor fixed the data core.

677
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,220
This is a good place now.

678
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:04,910
But I was worried you might be lonely.
So I brought you some friends.

679
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:06,990
Aren't I a clever girl?

680
00:42:07,597 --> 00:42:08,836
Aren't we all?

681
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:14,790
<i>Oh, for heaven's sake!</i>

682
00:42:15,313 --> 00:42:17,039
He just can't do it, can he?

683
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:21,000
That man, that impossible man!

684
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:25,310
He just can't give in.

685
00:42:42,664 --> 00:42:44,303
<i>Some days are special.</i>

686
00:42:45,048 --> 00:42:48,007
<i>Some days are so, so blessed.</i>

687
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:51,948
<i>Some days, nobody dies at all.</i>

688
00:43:19,031 --> 00:43:20,138
<i>Now and then,</i>

689
00:43:20,464 --> 00:43:24,443
<i>every once in a very long while,
every day in a million days,</i>

690
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:29,019
sser<i>when the wind stands fair,
and The Doctor comes to call...</i>

691
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,728
<i>everybody lives.</i>

692
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:07,471
Sweet dreams everyone.

693
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:16,098
You be careful.

694
00:44:16,198 --> 00:44:17,249
<i>Taking a big space truck</i>

695
00:44:17,349 --> 00:44:19,858
<i>with bunch of strangers across
diamond planet called Midnight?</i>

696
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:21,142
What could possibly go wrong?

697
00:44:21,242 --> 00:44:23,030
- Enjoy your trip.
- Oh, I can't wait.

698
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,590
What the hell is making that noise?

699
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:29,230
- It's trying the door.
- There is no it.

700
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:30,315
<i>What is it?</i>

701
00:44:30,415 --> 00:44:32,660
- Just tell me what the hell it is!
- Down!

702
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,050
If were gonna get out of
this, then you need me!

703
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,403
Like you're so special.

704
00:44:36,503 --> 00:44:39,331
- Two people are dead.
- Don't make it a third!

705
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:42,970
It's coming for me, it's coming for me.

706
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:45,800
Get out of there!
