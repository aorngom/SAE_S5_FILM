1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,863
<i>What you see.</i>

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,704
The Library.

3
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:16,830
<i>Open your eyes again.</i>

4
00:00:19,256 --> 00:00:20,414
<i>Where are you now?</i>

5
00:00:20,661 --> 00:00:22,208
My living room, Dr Moon.

6
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,617
<i>When you close your eyes...</i>

7
00:00:24,986 --> 00:00:26,475
I go to the Library.

8
00:00:28,608 --> 00:00:30,091
Go to the Library now.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,436
<i>- Are you back there?
- Yes.</i>

10
00:00:35,487 --> 00:00:36,601
<i>The same part?</i>

11
00:00:37,448 --> 00:00:39,148
<i>No, it's always different.</i>

12
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,445
<i>The Library goes on for ever.</i>

13
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:44,217
<i>How you do move around?</i>

14
00:00:45,474 --> 00:00:46,644
By wishing.

15
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,455
- What's wrong?
- Something's here!

16
00:00:52,874 --> 00:00:54,895
Someone's got in!
No-one's supposed to get in!

17
00:00:54,995 --> 00:00:57,257
She's never mentioned anyone.
She's always been alone.

18
00:00:57,357 --> 00:00:58,671
<i>Someone's in my library.</i>

19
00:01:01,355 --> 00:01:03,840
No! No, please! That's not allowed!

20
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,122
Listen to me.

21
00:01:06,448 --> 00:01:08,175
The Library is in your mind.

22
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:10,855
I know it's in my mind.
But something's got inside!

23
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,371
Oh! Hello!

24
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,705
Sorry to burst in on you like this.

25
00:01:27,118 --> 00:01:28,444
OK if we stop here for a bit?

26
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:56,855

30
00:02:07,514 --> 00:02:11,705
Books! People never
really stop loving books.

31
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:15,170
51st century.

32
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:19,122
By now you've got holovids,
direct to brain downloads, fiction mist,

33
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:22,738
but you need the smell.
The smell of books, Donna. Deep breath.

34
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:28,543
The Library.

35
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,603
So big it doesn't need a name.

36
00:02:32,703 --> 00:02:34,092
Just a great big "the."

37
00:02:34,536 --> 00:02:35,668
It's like a city.

38
00:02:35,768 --> 00:02:38,028
It's a world. Literally a world.

39
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:40,091
The core of the planet
is the index computer,

40
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:41,488
biggest hard drive ever.

41
00:02:41,588 --> 00:02:43,989
And up here,
every book ever written.

42
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:45,371
Whole continents of

43
00:02:45,903 --> 00:02:49,857
Jeffrey Archer, Bridget Jones,
Monty Python's Big Red Book.

44
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:52,495
Brand new editions,
specially printed.

45
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:56,815
<i>We're near the equator, so...</i>

46
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,889
this must be Biographies!

47
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,868
I love biographies.

48
00:03:02,968 --> 00:03:05,068
Yeah, very you.
Always a death at the end.

49
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:08,113
You need a good death.
Without death, there'd only be comedies.

50
00:03:08,213 --> 00:03:10,788
Dying gives us size. Oi!

51
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,108
- Spoilers!
- What?

52
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,787
These books are from your future.

53
00:03:14,887 --> 00:03:16,948
Don't read ahead,
spoil all the surprises.

54
00:03:17,048 --> 00:03:18,055
Like peeking at the end.

55
00:03:18,155 --> 00:03:20,827
Isn't travelling with you
one big spoiler?

56
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,216
I try to keep you away
from major plot developments.

57
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:28,501
Which, to be honest,
I seem to be very bad at,

58
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:30,271
cos... you know what?

59
00:03:30,371 --> 00:03:32,328
This is the biggest
library in the universe.

60
00:03:33,943 --> 00:03:35,250
So where is everyone?

61
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:41,175
It's silent.

62
00:03:42,226 --> 00:03:43,135
The Library?

63
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:47,807
The planet.

64
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:51,655
<i>The whole planet.</i>

65
00:03:53,932 --> 00:03:55,177
Maybe it's a Sunday.

66
00:03:55,484 --> 00:03:57,336
No, I never land on Sundays.

67
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:00,588
Sundays are boring. Well...

68
00:04:00,758 --> 00:04:04,143
Maybe everyone's really,
really quiet.

69
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:05,979
Yeah, maybe.

70
00:04:06,661 --> 00:04:08,638
But they'd still show up
on the system.

71
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,828
Doctor, why are we here?
Really, why?

72
00:04:11,928 --> 00:04:14,188
Oh, you know, just passing.

73
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:16,068
No, seriously.

74
00:04:16,168 --> 00:04:19,600
It was all, "Let's hit the beach,"
then suddenly we're in a library.

75
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,548
- Why?
- Now, that's interesting.

76
00:04:21,977 --> 00:04:23,710
- What?
- Scanning for life forms.

77
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,670
<i>If I do a scan looking for
your basic humanoids, you know,</i>

78
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:29,930
<i>your book readers, few limbs and
a face, apart from us, I get nothing.</i>

79
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,428
Zippo, nada, see?

80
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:37,621
Nobody home. But if I widen
the parameters to any kind of life...

81
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:44,068
<i>A million million.</i>

82
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:45,728
Gives up after that.

83
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,735
A million million.

84
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,395
<i>But there's nothing here.</i>

85
00:04:52,827 --> 00:04:53,809
<i>There's no-one.</i>

86
00:04:55,273 --> 00:04:56,743
<i>And not a sound.</i>

87
00:04:58,758 --> 00:05:01,098
A million million life forms,

88
00:05:02,406 --> 00:05:03,968
and silence in the Library.

89
00:05:05,966 --> 00:05:07,517
But there's no-one here.

90
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:11,228
There's just books.
I mean, it's not the books, is it?

91
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,148
I mean, it can't be
the books, can it?

92
00:05:13,559 --> 00:05:15,728
I mean, books can't be alive?

93
00:05:27,086 --> 00:05:28,248
<i>Welcome!</i>

94
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:32,935
- That came from in there.
- Yeah!

95
00:05:47,387 --> 00:05:51,235
I am Courtesy Node 710/aqua.

96
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:55,060
Please enjoy the Library and
respect the personal access codes

97
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,934
of all your fellow readers
regardless of species or hygiene taboo.

98
00:06:00,635 --> 00:06:02,030
That face, it looks real.

99
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,718
Yeah, don't worry about it.

100
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,335
But a statue with a real face, though!

101
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:09,837
- It's a hologram, isn't it?
- No, but really, it's fine.

102
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:13,528
Additional, There follows a brief
message from the head librarian

103
00:06:13,628 --> 00:06:15,139
for your urgent attention.

104
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:17,654
It has been edited for tone and content

105
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:21,383
by a Felman Lux Automated
Decency Filter.

106
00:06:21,828 --> 00:06:23,292
Message follows.

107
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:24,207
"Run.

108
00:06:24,545 --> 00:06:25,815
"For God's sake, run.

109
00:06:27,029 --> 00:06:28,724
<i>"Nowhere is safe.</i>

110
00:06:28,824 --> 00:06:33,516
"The Library has sealed itself,
we can't... Oh, they're here.

111
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:37,948
"Arg. Slarg. Snick."
Message ends.

112
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:43,108
<i>Please switch off your mobile comm
units for the comfort of other readers.</i>

113
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,266
So that's why we're here.

114
00:06:46,186 --> 00:06:48,182
Any other messages, same date stamp?

115
00:06:48,345 --> 00:06:50,027
<i>One additional message.</i>

116
00:06:50,488 --> 00:06:54,257
This message carries a Felman
Lux coherency warning of...

117
00:06:54,357 --> 00:06:56,678
- Yeah, yeah, fine, just play it.
-  5, 0, 11...

123
00:07:12,685 --> 00:07:13,335
Donna...

124
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:15,081
Yeah?

125
00:07:17,114 --> 00:07:18,528
Stay out of the shadows.

126
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:22,100
Why, what's in the shadows?

127
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:41,373
So...

128
00:07:42,393 --> 00:07:44,225
We weren't just
in the neighbourhood.

129
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:46,990
Yeah, I kind of, sort of lied a bit.

130
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:49,655
I got a message
on the psychic paper.

131
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:53,858
What do you think, cry for help?

132
00:07:54,834 --> 00:07:57,775
Cry for help, with a kiss?

133
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:00,164
Oh, we've all done that.

134
00:08:00,264 --> 00:08:02,628
- Who's it from?
- No idea.

135
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:05,079
- So why did we come here, why did you?
- Donna.

136
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:10,514
- What's happening?
- Run!

137
00:08:12,804 --> 00:08:15,488
- What, is it locked?
- Jammed! The wood's warped!

138
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:19,079
Sonic it, use the thingy!

139
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:22,631
- I can't, it's wood!
- What, it doesn't do wood?!

140
00:08:22,731 --> 00:08:25,077
If I can vibrate the molecules,
fry the bindings,

141
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:27,905
- I can shatterline the interface.
- Oh, get out of the way!

142
00:08:37,265 --> 00:08:39,188
Oh! Hello!

143
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,928
Sorry to burst in on you like this.
OK if we stop here for a bit?

144
00:08:45,886 --> 00:08:46,843
What is it?

145
00:08:49,158 --> 00:08:50,455
Security camera.

146
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,328
Switched itself off.

147
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:00,884
They were in my library.
How can they be in my library?

148
00:09:01,128 --> 00:09:02,068
Who were they?

149
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,093
What's that? What's that noise?

150
00:09:05,193 --> 00:09:06,138
What noise?

151
00:09:09,322 --> 00:09:10,599
Nice door skills, Donna.

152
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:14,622
Well, you know, boyfriends, sometimes
you need the element of surprise.

153
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:16,086
<i>What was that ?</i>

154
00:09:16,737 --> 00:09:18,057
What was after us?

155
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:20,578
I mean, did we just run away
from a power cut?

156
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:21,739
Possibly.

157
00:09:24,248 --> 00:09:25,680
Are we safe here?

158
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:28,715
Course we're safe.
There's a little shop.

159
00:09:34,715 --> 00:09:35,595
Gotcha!

160
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:38,893
No, stop it!

161
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,655
No, no!

162
00:09:44,448 --> 00:09:45,703
Ooh, I'm sorry.

163
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:49,895
I really am, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry. It's alive.

164
00:09:50,376 --> 00:09:52,291
You said it was a security camera.

165
00:09:53,086 --> 00:09:53,961
It is.

166
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:56,439
It's an alive one.

167
00:09:56,802 --> 00:09:57,859
Can you hear me?

168
00:09:59,004 --> 00:10:00,215
Are you all right?

169
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:05,735
- Others are coming.
- Who's coming?

170
00:10:06,172 --> 00:10:07,179
Who are the others?

171
00:10:07,605 --> 00:10:09,148
The Library is breached.

172
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:11,775
- Others are coming.
- What others?

173
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:13,079
<i>Others?</i>

174
00:10:13,998 --> 00:10:15,426
<i>What does it mean, "others"?</i>

175
00:10:19,262 --> 00:10:21,508
Excuse me,
what does it mean, "others"?

176
00:10:21,608 --> 00:10:24,828
That's barely more than a speak
your weight machine, it can't help you.

177
00:10:24,928 --> 00:10:26,236
So why's it got a face?

178
00:10:26,968 --> 00:10:29,558
This flesh aspect was donated
by Mark Chambers

179
00:10:29,658 --> 00:10:31,666
on the occasion of his death.

180
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,228
It's a real face?

181
00:10:34,328 --> 00:10:36,884
It has been actualised
individually for you

182
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:41,015
<i>from the many facial aspects
saved to our extensive flesh banks.</i>

183
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,335
Please enjoy.

184
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,998
It chose me a dead face
it thought I'd like?

185
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,569
That statue's got a real
dead person's face on it!

186
00:10:48,669 --> 00:10:49,748
<i>It's the 51st century.</i>

187
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:52,628
That's basically
like donating a park bench.

188
00:10:52,843 --> 00:10:54,345
It's donating a face!

189
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:56,328
No, wait, no!

190
00:10:56,554 --> 00:10:59,087
- Oi! Hands!
- The shadow, look.

191
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,052
What about it?

192
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,998
Count the shadows.

193
00:11:05,143 --> 00:11:08,748
One. There,
I counted it, one shadow.

194
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:09,655
Yeah...

195
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,048
But what's casting it?

196
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:26,023
Oh! I'm thick!
Look at me, I'm old and thick!

197
00:11:26,123 --> 00:11:28,229
Head's too full of stuff,
I need a bigger head!

198
00:11:33,022 --> 00:11:34,428
<i>Power must be going.</i>

199
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,355
This place runs on fission cells.
They'll outburn the sun.

200
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:40,577
- Then why's it dark?
- It's not dark.

201
00:11:44,807 --> 00:11:45,934
That shadow.

202
00:11:46,848 --> 00:11:47,692
It's gone.

203
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:50,126
We need to get back to the TARDIS.

204
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:50,895
Why?

205
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:53,628
Because that shadow hasn't gone.
It's moved.

206
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,318
Reminder,

207
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:57,868
the Library has been breached,
others are coming.

208
00:11:58,403 --> 00:11:58,972
Reminder,

209
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:01,948
<i>the Library has been breached,
others are coming.</i>

210
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:03,480
<i>Reminder,</i>

211
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,971
<i>the Library has been breached...</i>

212
00:12:26,437 --> 00:12:27,735
Hello, sweetie.

213
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:29,803
- Get out.
- Doctor?

214
00:12:29,903 --> 00:12:32,535
All of you, turn around,
get back in your rocket and fly away.

215
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:34,600
Tell your grandchildren
you came here and lived,

216
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,783
they won't believe you.

217
00:12:35,883 --> 00:12:38,442
Pop your helmets, everyone.
We've got breathers.

218
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,207
How do you know they're not androids?

219
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,691
Cos I've dated androids.

220
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,950
- They're rubbish.
- Who is this?

221
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:47,988
You said we were the only expedition,
I paid for exclusives.

222
00:12:48,088 --> 00:12:49,354
I lied, I'm always lying.

223
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:50,530
Bound to be others.

224
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:53,052
Miss Evangelista,
I want to see the contracts.

225
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:55,561
You came through the north door?
Much damage?

226
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:58,777
Please, just leave. I'm asking you
seriously and properly, just lea...

227
00:12:58,877 --> 00:13:00,308
Did you say expedition?

228
00:13:00,408 --> 00:13:02,913
My expedition, I funded it.

229
00:13:03,163 --> 00:13:06,588
Oh, you're not, are you?
Tell me you're not archaeologists.

230
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:08,609
Got a problem with archaeologists?

231
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:11,512
I'm a time traveller.
I point and laugh at archaeologists.

232
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,228
Professor River Song, archaeologist.

233
00:13:15,454 --> 00:13:16,448
River Song? Lovely name.

234
00:13:16,548 --> 00:13:19,213
As you're leaving, you need
to set up a quarantine beacon.

235
00:13:19,313 --> 00:13:20,196
Code-wall the planet,

236
00:13:20,296 --> 00:13:23,951
the whole planet. Nobody comes here,
not ever again. No-one living thing.

237
00:13:24,051 --> 00:13:26,786
Not here, not ever. Stop right there!
What's your name?

238
00:13:26,886 --> 00:13:27,548
Anita.

239
00:13:27,648 --> 00:13:29,148
Anita, stay out of the shadows.

240
00:13:29,248 --> 00:13:32,628
Not a foot, not a finger in the shadows
till you're safely back in your ship.

241
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:36,828
Stay in the light.
Find a nice, bright spot and just stand.

242
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,855
If you understand me,
look very, very scared.

243
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:47,855
No, bit more scared than that.

244
00:13:50,543 --> 00:13:52,783
OK, do for now.
You, who are you?

245
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:53,928
- Dave.
- OK, Dave...

246
00:13:54,028 --> 00:13:57,113
Oh, well Other Dave,
because that's Proper Dave

247
00:13:57,213 --> 00:13:59,916
the pilot, he was the first Dave,
so when we...

248
00:14:00,016 --> 00:14:02,763
Other Dave, the way you came,
does it look the same as before?

249
00:14:02,863 --> 00:14:04,653
Yeah. Oh, it's a bit darker.

250
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:05,579
How much darker?

251
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:08,552
Oh, I could see where we came through
just a moment ago. I can't now.

252
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:10,417
Seal the door. Find another way out.

253
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:13,945
We're not looking for a way out.
Miss Evangelista?

254
00:14:14,045 --> 00:14:17,486
I'm Mr Lux's personal... everything.

255
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,476
You need to sign these contracts
agreeing that your experiences

256
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,003
inside the Library are...

257
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:25,442
the intellectual property of
the Felman Lux Corporation.

258
00:14:25,542 --> 00:14:28,029
- Right, give it here.
- Yeah, lovely. Thanks.

259
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:33,770
My family built this library.
I have rights.

260
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:37,188
You have a mouth that won't stop.
You think there's danger here?

261
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:39,764
Something came to this library
and killed everything in it,

262
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:41,268
killed a whole world.

263
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,468
- Danger? Could be.
- That was 100 years ago.

264
00:14:43,568 --> 00:14:47,138
The Library's been silent for 100 years.
Whatever came here is long dead.

265
00:14:47,475 --> 00:14:48,408
Bet your life?

266
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,455
Always.

267
00:14:51,737 --> 00:14:53,004
<i>What do you doing?</i>

268
00:14:54,217 --> 00:14:55,281
<i>He said seal the door.</i>

269
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:57,015
Torch! You're taking orders from him?

270
00:14:57,115 --> 00:14:58,274
Spooky, isn't it?

271
00:15:07,499 --> 00:15:09,455
Almost every species in the universe

272
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:11,948
<i>has an irrational fear of the dark.</i>

273
00:15:12,048 --> 00:15:15,071
<i>But they're wrong.
Cos it's not irrational.</i>

274
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:19,249
It's Vashta Nerada.

275
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:21,628
<i>What's Vashta Nerada?</i>

276
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:23,503
It's what's in the dark.

277
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:26,556
It's what's always in the dark.

278
00:15:28,488 --> 00:15:31,163
- Lights! You got lights?
- What for?

279
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,942
Form a circle, safe area,
big as you can, lights pointing out.

280
00:15:35,042 --> 00:15:37,645
- Do as he says.
- You're not listening to this man?!

281
00:15:37,745 --> 00:15:39,866
Apparently, I am. Unpack the lights.

282
00:15:39,966 --> 00:15:42,548
Other Dave, make sure the door's secure,
then help Anita.

283
00:15:42,648 --> 00:15:45,221
Mr Lux, put your helmet
back on, block the visor.

284
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,215
Proper Dave, I want you
to access the library database,

285
00:15:48,315 --> 00:15:50,853
see what you can find about what
happened a hundred years ago.

286
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:53,228
Pretty Boy, you're with me.

287
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:55,028
Step into my office.

288
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:58,204
Professor Song,
why am I the only one wearing my helmet?

289
00:15:58,855 --> 00:16:00,181
I don't fancy you.

290
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,159
Probably, I can help you.

291
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:05,768
Pretty Boy, with me, I said.

292
00:16:09,544 --> 00:16:11,534
- Oh, I'm Pretty Boy?
- Yes.

293
00:16:11,803 --> 00:16:13,335
Ooh, that came out a bit quick!

294
00:16:13,892 --> 00:16:14,900
Pretty?!

295
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:20,709
Don't let your shadows cross!
Seriously. Don't even let them touch.

296
00:16:20,809 --> 00:16:23,957
- Any of them could be infected.
- How can a shadow be infected?

297
00:16:24,057 --> 00:16:25,446
'Scuse me, can I help?

298
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:27,945
- No, we're fine.
- I could just...

299
00:16:28,045 --> 00:16:29,255
you know, hold things.

300
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,895
No, really, we're OK.

301
00:16:31,611 --> 00:16:32,237
éOK.

302
00:16:39,127 --> 00:16:40,316
Couldn't she help?

303
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,441
Trust me, I just spent 4 days on
a ship with that woman. She's...

304
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:46,360
Couldn't tell the difference between
the escape pod and the bathroom.

305
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,908
<i>We had to go back for her.</i>

306
00:16:48,977 --> 00:16:49,684
Twice.

307
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,092
- Thanks.
- For what?

308
00:17:04,192 --> 00:17:05,781
The usual. For coming when I call.

309
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,433
That was you?

310
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:09,585
You're doing a good job,
like you don't know me.

311
00:17:09,685 --> 00:17:11,134
I'm assuming there's a reason.

312
00:17:11,293 --> 00:17:14,581
- A fairly good one, actually.
- OK, shall we do diaries, then?

313
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:16,120
Where are we this time?

314
00:17:16,688 --> 00:17:19,918
Going by your face,
I'd say it's early days for you, yeah?

315
00:17:20,018 --> 00:17:21,175
So, erm...

316
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:24,081
Crash of the Byzantium...
have we done that yet?

317
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:29,048
Obviously ringing no bells.

318
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:33,953
Right, Picnic at Asgard.

319
00:17:34,591 --> 00:17:36,185
Have we done Asgard yet?

320
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,108
Obviously not.

321
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,655
Blimey, very early days, then. Hoo!

322
00:17:42,755 --> 00:17:46,337
Life with a time traveller
never knew it could be such hard work.

323
00:17:51,722 --> 00:17:52,767
Look at you!

324
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,015
- You're young.
- I'm really not, you know.

325
00:17:58,429 --> 00:17:59,855
No, but you are.

326
00:18:01,532 --> 00:18:02,421
Your eyes.

327
00:18:04,286 --> 00:18:06,319
<i>You're younger
than I've ever seen you.</i>

328
00:18:08,459 --> 00:18:10,330
You've seen me before, then?

329
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:14,478
Doctor...

330
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,013
Please tell me you know who I am?

331
00:18:20,159 --> 00:18:21,091
Who are you?

332
00:18:30,612 --> 00:18:33,753
Sorry, that was me. Trying to get
through into the security protocols,

333
00:18:33,853 --> 00:18:35,218
I seem to have set something off.

334
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:38,695
- What is that, is that an alarm?
- Doctor.

335
00:18:39,186 --> 00:18:41,000
- Doctor, that sounds like...
- It is.

336
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:42,301
It's a phone!

337
00:19:00,024 --> 00:19:00,884
Dad!

338
00:19:00,984 --> 00:19:02,154
<i>In a minute.</i>

339
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:12,625
I'm trying to call up the data core,
it's not responding. Just that noise.

340
00:19:12,725 --> 00:19:15,059
- But it's a phone!
- Let me try something.

341
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:22,473
Dad! The phone,
aren't you going to answer it?

342
00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:24,819
It's not ringing, sweetie.

343
00:19:37,927 --> 00:19:40,354
OK, doesn't like that,
let's try something else.

344
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:53,615
'OK, here it comes.'

345
00:19:57,536 --> 00:19:58,274
Hello?

346
00:19:58,537 --> 00:20:01,156
Hello. Are you in my television?

347
00:20:02,088 --> 00:20:04,810
Well, no, I'm...

348
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:08,032
I'm sort of in space.
I was trying to call up

349
00:20:08,132 --> 00:20:10,577
the data core of a triple-grid
security processor.

350
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,045
Would you like to speak to my dad?

351
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:16,261
Your dad or your mum,
that would be lovely.

352
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:21,535
I know you! You were in my library.

353
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:22,592
YOUR library?

354
00:20:23,293 --> 00:20:25,388
The Library's never been
on the television before.

355
00:20:25,488 --> 00:20:26,821
What have you done?

356
00:20:27,716 --> 00:20:31,857
Ah, I... just rerouted the interface...

357
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:35,993
What happened. Who was that?

358
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,179
Keep working on those lights,
we need those lights!

359
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,187
You heard him, people,
let there be light.

360
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:11,645
Sorry. Youre not allowed to see
inside the book, its against the rules.

361
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,122
What rules?

362
00:21:13,935 --> 00:21:14,964
Your rules.

363
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,391
What's that?

364
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:49,118
- I didnt do that, did you do that?
- Not me.

365
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:54,095
What's CAL?

366
00:22:13,972 --> 00:22:15,004
You all right?

367
00:22:15,329 --> 00:22:17,656
What's that? What's happening?

368
00:22:17,894 --> 00:22:18,895
<i>I don't know.</i>

369
00:22:19,759 --> 00:22:23,481
Oh, thanks for... you know...
offering to help with the lights.

370
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,347
They don't want me.

371
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:28,916
They think I'm stupid cos I'm pretty.

372
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:31,860
Course they don't, nobody thinks that.

373
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,289
No, they're right though.

374
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:35,055
I'm a moron, me.

375
00:22:35,472 --> 00:22:37,562
My dad said I have the IQ of plankton.

376
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:38,996
And I was pleased.

377
00:22:39,822 --> 00:22:41,574
See, thats funny.

378
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,922
No, I really was pleased.

379
00:22:47,436 --> 00:22:49,506
- Is that funny?
- No, no.

380
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,375
What's causing that?

381
00:22:54,635 --> 00:22:56,040
Is it the little girl?

382
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,765
<i>But who is the little girl?</i>

383
00:22:57,865 --> 00:22:59,573
What's she got to do with this place?

384
00:23:04,409 --> 00:23:07,567
How does the data core work?
What's the principle? What's CAL?

385
00:23:07,667 --> 00:23:08,831
Ask Mr Lux.

386
00:23:09,976 --> 00:23:10,945
CAL, what is it?

387
00:23:11,283 --> 00:23:14,855
Sorry. You didn't sign your
Personal Experience contracts.

388
00:23:15,974 --> 00:23:18,545
Mr Lux, right now,

389
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:21,630
you're in more danger than you've
ever been in your whole life.

390
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:23,375
And you're protecting a patent?

391
00:23:23,475 --> 00:23:26,161
I'm protecting my family's pride.

392
00:23:26,424 --> 00:23:31,135
Well, funny thing, Mr Lux. I don't
want to see everyone in this room dead

393
00:23:31,296 --> 00:23:34,543
because some idiot thinks
his pride is more important.

394
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,725
Then why don't you sign his contract?

395
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,205
I didn't either.
I'm getting worse than you.

396
00:23:46,506 --> 00:23:47,676
Ok, ok, ok.

397
00:23:47,776 --> 00:23:50,035
Let's start at the beginning.
What happened here?

398
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,380
On the actual day, a hundred years ago,
what physically happened?

399
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,939
<i>There was a message
from the library. Just one.</i>

400
00:24:00,821 --> 00:24:02,204
The lights are going out.

401
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,495
Then the computer sealed the planet and
there was nothing for a hundred years.

402
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:11,335
It's taken 3 generations of my family
to decode the seals and get back in.

403
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:12,620
Excuse me...

404
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,977
<i>Not, just now.</i>

405
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:18,507
There was one other thing
in the last message...

406
00:24:18,607 --> 00:24:19,879
That's confidential.

407
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:21,049
I trust this man.

408
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:23,183
With my life, with everything.

409
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:26,542
- You've only just met him.
- No, he's only just met me.

410
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,264
This might be important actually...

411
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,853
In a moment!

412
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:37,690
This is a data extract
that came with the message.

413
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:41,454
4022 saved. No survivors.

414
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:46,521
4022, that's the exact number of people
who were in the Library

415
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:48,142
when the planet was sealed.

416
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,169
But how can 4022 people have
been saved if there were no survivors?

417
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,728
That's what were here to find out.

418
00:24:54,828 --> 00:24:58,357
And so far, what we havent
found, are any bodies.

419
00:26:17,332 --> 00:26:19,215
Everybody, careful. Stay in the light.

420
00:26:19,315 --> 00:26:20,830
Keep saying. I don't see the point!

421
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,550
- Who screamed?
- Miss Evangelista.

422
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,832
Where is she?

423
00:26:25,302 --> 00:26:27,764
Miss Evangelista,
please state your current...

424
00:26:33,201 --> 00:26:34,752
Please state your current...

425
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,322
position.

426
00:26:49,278 --> 00:26:50,148
It's her.

427
00:26:54,609 --> 00:26:56,110
It's Miss Evangelista.

428
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,380
<i>We heard her scream a few seconds ago.</i>

429
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,442
What could do that to a
person in a few seconds?

430
00:27:00,542 --> 00:27:02,960
- It took less than a few seconds.
- What did?

431
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,877
<i>Hello?</i>

432
00:27:04,265 --> 00:27:09,056
Erm, I'm sorry everyone
this isn't going to be pleasant.

433
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,431
She's ghosting.

434
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,795
She's what?

435
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,845
<i>Hello, excuse me?</i>

436
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,298
<i>I'm sorry, hello, excuse me?</i>

437
00:27:20,018 --> 00:27:23,090
That's. That's her.
That's Miss Evangelista!

438
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:26,130
I don't want to sound horrible,
but couldn't we just. You know?

439
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:28,430
This is her last moment... no, we cant.

440
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:30,190
A little respect, thank you.

441
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:33,460
<i>Sorry, where am I? Excuse me?</i>

442
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,560
But that's Miss Evangelista.

443
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,855
It's a Data Ghost,
she'll be gone in a moment.

444
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:43,478
Miss Evangelista,
you're fine, just relax.

445
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:45,220
We'll be with you presently.

446
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,134
What's a Data Ghost?

447
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,637
There's a neural relay
in the communicator.

448
00:27:49,737 --> 00:27:51,132
Let's you send thought mails.

449
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,685
<i>That's it there, those green lights.</i>

450
00:27:54,848 --> 00:27:57,717
<i>Sometimes it can hold an impression
of a living consciousness</i>

451
00:27:57,817 --> 00:27:59,548
<i>for a short time after death.</i>

452
00:28:00,474 --> 00:28:01,657
Like an after image.

453
00:28:03,215 --> 00:28:05,089
My grandfather lasted a day.

454
00:28:06,389 --> 00:28:08,441
Kept talking about his shoelaces.

455
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,063
She's in there!

456
00:28:12,339 --> 00:28:15,628
<i>I can't see, I can't... Where am I?</i>

457
00:28:15,728 --> 00:28:18,862
She's just brain waves now.
The pattern won't hold for long.

458
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:23,491
She's conscious! She's thinking.

459
00:28:23,591 --> 00:28:25,160
<i>I can't see, I can't...</i>

460
00:28:25,967 --> 00:28:27,322
<i>I don't know what I'm thinking.</i>

461
00:28:27,422 --> 00:28:29,547
She's a footprint on the beach.

462
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,499
And the tides coming in.

463
00:28:31,912 --> 00:28:33,303
<i>Where is that woman?</i>

464
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,818
<i>The nice woman... is she there?</i>

465
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,352
What woman?

466
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,730
She means... I think she means me.

467
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:47,254
<i>Is she there? The nice woman?</i>

468
00:28:48,488 --> 00:28:51,042
Yes, she's here, hang on.

469
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:54,946
Go ahead. She can hear you.

470
00:28:55,046 --> 00:28:56,331
<i>Hello? Are you there?</i>

471
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,671
Help her.

472
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:02,221
- She's dead.
- Yeah. Help her.

473
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:06,688
<i>Hello? Is that the nice woman?</i>

474
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:11,166
Yeah. Hello.
Yeah, I'm I'm... I'm here.

475
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,934
You OK?

476
00:29:14,057 --> 00:29:17,175
<i>What I said before...
about being stupid...</i>

477
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:19,900
<i>don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

478
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,600
Course I won't.
Course I won't tell them.

479
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,975
<i>Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

480
00:29:25,808 --> 00:29:29,004
I won't tell them. I said I won't.

481
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,669
<i>Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh.</i>

482
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:34,903
I'm not going to tell them.

483
00:29:35,003 --> 00:29:36,036
Don't tell the others...

484
00:29:36,136 --> 00:29:38,326
She's looping now.
The patterns degrading.

485
00:29:38,426 --> 00:29:42,375
<i>I can't think, I... don't know, I...</i>

486
00:29:43,675 --> 00:29:44,348
<i>I...</i>

487
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:45,962
<i>I...</i>

488
00:29:46,972 --> 00:29:47,775
<i>Ice cream.</i>

489
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,795
<i>Ice cream.</i>

490
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,585
<i>Ice cream.</i>

491
00:29:52,329 --> 00:29:53,324
<i>Ice cream.</i>

492
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:54,780
<i>Ice cream.</i>

493
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,862
- Doe's anybody mind if I.
-  Ice cream.

494
00:29:57,638 --> 00:29:58,689
<i> Ice cream.</i>

495
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:00,253
<i> Ice cream.</i>

496
00:30:01,185 --> 00:30:02,295
<i> Ice cream.</i>

497
00:30:05,912 --> 00:30:06,650
<i>Was...</i>

498
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,096
<i>That was horrible.</i>

499
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:11,574
That was the most horrible
thing I've ever seen.

500
00:30:13,057 --> 00:30:16,710
No. It's just a freak of technology.

501
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,842
But whatever did this to her,
whatever killed her...

502
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:25,200
I'd like a word with that.

503
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,459
I'll introduce you.

504
00:30:36,321 --> 00:30:38,604
- I'm going to need a packed lunch.
- Hang on.

505
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:43,728
- What's in that book?
- Spoilers.

506
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:45,182
Who are you?

507
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,570
- Professor River Song, University of...
- To me.

508
00:30:48,755 --> 00:30:52,283
- Who are you to me?
- Again... spoilers.

509
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,531
Chicken, and a bit of salad.
Knock yourself out.

510
00:30:59,872 --> 00:31:03,801
Right, you lot.
Let's all meet the Vashta Nerada!

511
00:31:09,094 --> 00:31:10,710
Darling, Dr Moon is going now.

512
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:13,360
But hed like a word with
you alone, is that all right?

513
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:16,247
- Yes, of course, Dr Moon.
- Thank you.

514
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:21,151
Now,

515
00:31:22,259 --> 00:31:23,097
listen.

516
00:31:25,412 --> 00:31:26,576
This is important.

517
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:31,707
There's the realworld, and
there's the world of nightmares.

518
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,630
That's right, Isn't there?
You understand?

519
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:35,355
Yes, I know, Dr Moon.

520
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,055
What I want you to remember is this...

521
00:31:39,155 --> 00:31:40,374
<i>and I know its hard.</i>

522
00:31:41,603 --> 00:31:46,815
The real world is a lie,
and your nightmares are real.

523
00:31:47,478 --> 00:31:48,970
The Library is real.

524
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:53,120
There are people trapped in
there, people who need to be saved.

525
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,929
The shadows are moving again.

526
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,615
<i>Those people are depending on you.</i>

527
00:32:00,242 --> 00:32:01,855
Only you can save them.

528
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,096
<i>Only you.</i>

529
00:32:12,537 --> 00:32:14,375
You travel with him, don't you?

530
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:17,294
The Doctor, you travel with him.

531
00:32:17,951 --> 00:32:18,889
What of it?

532
00:32:19,565 --> 00:32:21,129
<i>Proper Dave, could you move over a bit?</i>

533
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:21,836
Why?

534
00:32:21,936 --> 00:32:23,976
Just over there by the water cooler.
Thanks.

535
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:28,834
You know him, don't you?

536
00:32:28,934 --> 00:32:30,698
Oh, God, do I know that man.

537
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:34,208
<i>We go way back, that man and me.</i>

538
00:32:35,018 --> 00:32:36,488
<i>Just not this far back.</i>

539
00:32:36,701 --> 00:32:37,855
<i>I'm sorry, what?</i>

540
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:40,277
He hasn't met me yet.

541
00:32:42,811 --> 00:32:46,033
I sent him a message but
it went wrong, it arrived too early.

542
00:32:46,966 --> 00:32:49,337
This is the Doctor in the
days before he knew me.

543
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,940
And he looks at me,
and he looks right through me.

544
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,232
And it shouldn't kill me, but it does.

545
00:32:58,664 --> 00:33:01,498
What are you talking about?
Are you just talking rubbish?

546
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:03,360
Do you know him or don't you?

547
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,712
- Donna, quiet, I'm working!
- Sorry!

548
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,533
Donna? You're Donna? Donna Noble?

549
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,548
Yeah, why?

550
00:33:13,143 --> 00:33:14,955
I do know the Doctor.

551
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,001
But in the future.

552
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,247
His personal future.

553
00:33:20,042 --> 00:33:21,650
So why don't you know me?

554
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:23,752
Where am I in the future?

555
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:28,504
<i>OK! We've got a live one.</i>

556
00:33:30,356 --> 00:33:34,053
That's not darkness down those
tunnels, this is not a shadow.

557
00:33:34,835 --> 00:33:36,015
It's a swarm.

558
00:33:36,778 --> 00:33:38,230
A man-eating swarm.

559
00:33:41,996 --> 00:33:45,196
The piranhas of the air,
the Vashta Nerada.

560
00:33:45,909 --> 00:33:48,312
Literally the shadows
that melt the flesh.

561
00:33:48,981 --> 00:33:51,772
Most planets have them,
but usually in small clusters.

562
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,420
I've never seen an infestation
on this scale, or this aggressive.

563
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,405
What d'you mean, most planets?
Not Earth?

564
00:33:57,505 --> 00:34:00,483
Mmmm, Earth, and a billion other worlds.

565
00:34:00,658 --> 00:34:02,654
Where there's meat,
there's Vashta Nerada.

566
00:34:02,817 --> 00:34:04,745
<i>You can see them sometimes, if you look.</i>

567
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:07,090
The dust in sunbeams.

568
00:34:08,823 --> 00:34:11,207
If they were on Earth, we'd know.

569
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:13,605
Nah, normally they live on road kill.

570
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:16,138
<i>But sometimes people go missing.</i>

571
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,742
Not everyone comes back out of the dark.

572
00:34:20,093 --> 00:34:21,150
Every shadow?

573
00:34:21,331 --> 00:34:24,194
No. But any shadow.

574
00:34:24,707 --> 00:34:25,971
So what do we do?

575
00:34:26,403 --> 00:34:28,098
Daleks: aim for the eyestalk.

576
00:34:28,198 --> 00:34:30,094
Sontarans: back of the neck.

577
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:35,370
Vashta Nerada: Run! Just run.

578
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,634
Run where?

579
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,330
This is an index point.
There must be an exit teleport.

580
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:41,690
Don't look at me, I haven't
memorised the schematics!

581
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,721
Doctor,

582
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:45,453
little shop! They always make you
go through it on the way out

583
00:34:45,553 --> 00:34:47,111
so they can sell you stuff.

584
00:34:48,194 --> 00:34:50,609
You're right! Brilliant!
That's why I like the little shop!

585
00:34:50,709 --> 00:34:51,547
OK, let's move it.

586
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:54,570
<i>Actually, Proper Dave, could you
stay where you are for a moment?</i>

587
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:55,470
Why?

588
00:34:57,172 --> 00:35:00,191
I'm sorry. I am so, so sorry.

589
00:35:03,006 --> 00:35:04,566
But you've got two shadows.

590
00:35:11,135 --> 00:35:15,668
<i>It's how they hunt, they latch on
to a food source and keep it fresh.</i>

591
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,516
- What do I do?
- You stay absolutely still.

592
00:35:19,616 --> 00:35:22,055
Like there's a wasp in the room,
a million wasps.

593
00:35:22,155 --> 00:35:24,096
- We're not leaving you, Dave.
- Of course not.

594
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:26,154
Where's your helmet?
Don't point, tell me.

595
00:35:26,790 --> 00:35:28,528
On the floor, by my bag.

596
00:35:29,035 --> 00:35:30,645
Don't cross his shadow!

597
00:35:37,455 --> 00:35:38,024
Thanks.

598
00:35:38,562 --> 00:35:42,400
Now, the rest of you,
helmets back on and sealed up.

599
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,132
- We'll need everything we've got.
- We haven't any helmets.

600
00:35:45,232 --> 00:35:47,561
- Yeah, we're safe anyway.
- How are we safe?

601
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:49,275
That was a clever lie to shut you up.

602
00:35:49,375 --> 00:35:51,280
Professor, anything
I can do with the suit?

603
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,975
What good are suits? Miss Evanglista
was wearing one, there was nothing left.

604
00:35:55,075 --> 00:35:58,543
We can increase the mesh-density
dial it up 400%. Make it a tougher meal.

605
00:35:58,643 --> 00:35:59,262
<i>OK.</i>

606
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:03,898
- 800%! Pass it on.
- Gotcha!

607
00:36:04,161 --> 00:36:06,094
- What's that?
- It's a screwdriver.

608
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:10,056
- It's sonic.
- Yeah, I know. Snap!

609
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,538
With me, come on!

610
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,090
Are we shopping?
Is it a good time to shop?

611
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,491
No talking, just moving!
Stand up in the middle!

612
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:29,086
Its a teleport, stand in the middle.

613
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,876
Can't send the others,
TARDIS won't recognise them.

614
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:33,135
- What you doing?
- You don't have suit, not safe!

615
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:35,931
You don't have a suit, you're
in just as much danger as I am...

616
00:36:36,031 --> 00:36:37,521
Donna! Let me explain.

617
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:40,735
- Oh, that's how you do it!
- Doctor!

618
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,762
Where did it go?

619
00:36:55,394 --> 00:36:58,529
It's just gone. I looked round,
one shadow. See.

620
00:36:58,629 --> 00:37:00,420
Does that mean we can leave?

621
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,370
I don't know why we're still here.
We can leave him, can't we?

622
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:06,220
- I mean, no offence.
- Shut up, Mr Lux.

623
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,080
Did you feel anything?
Like an energy transfer?

624
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:11,484
No, no, but, look, it's gone.

625
00:37:11,584 --> 00:37:13,580
Stop there, stop moving.

626
00:37:13,968 --> 00:37:16,095
They're never just gone.
And they never give up.

627
00:37:19,551 --> 00:37:21,534
Well, this ones benign.

628
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:23,877
<i>Hey, who turned out the lights?</i>

629
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,430
No-one, they're fine.

630
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,462
<i>No, seriously, turn them back on!</i>

631
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,044
They are on.

632
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,483
<i>I can't see a ruddy thing.</i>

633
00:37:31,858 --> 00:37:33,923
Dave, turn round.

634
00:37:34,023 --> 00:37:36,255
What's going on? Why can't I see?

635
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,916
Is the power gone, are we safe here?

636
00:37:39,016 --> 00:37:41,580
Dave, I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

637
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,902
Dave, Dave? Dave,
can you hear me, are you all right?

638
00:37:45,002 --> 00:37:46,460
Talk to me, Dave.

639
00:37:47,817 --> 00:37:50,620
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm... fine.

640
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,220
I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

641
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,460
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm... fine.

642
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:01,478
I can't. Why can't I? I...

643
00:38:03,486 --> 00:38:06,582
I can't. Why can't I? I...

644
00:38:08,021 --> 00:38:11,143
I can't. Why can't I?

645
00:38:12,551 --> 00:38:12,976
I...

646
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,870
He's gone. He's ghosting.

647
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:17,030
Then why is he still standing?

648
00:38:18,069 --> 00:38:19,626
Who turned out the lights?

649
00:38:21,309 --> 00:38:22,910
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

650
00:38:23,068 --> 00:38:24,137
Doctor, don't!

651
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:25,870
Dave, can you hear me?

652
00:38:26,477 --> 00:38:28,048
Who turned out the lights?

653
00:38:31,777 --> 00:38:33,285
<i>Who turned out the lights?</i>

654
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:36,101
- Who turned out the lights?
- Scuse me!

655
00:38:38,017 --> 00:38:40,013
Back from it, get back, right back!

656
00:38:45,807 --> 00:38:48,770
- Doesn't move very fast does it?
- It's a swarm in a suit.

657
00:38:48,928 --> 00:38:50,257
But it's learning.

658
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,110
What do we do? Where do we go?

659
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,855
See that wall behind you?

660
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:00,831
DUCK!

661
00:39:02,155 --> 00:39:03,428
Squareness gun!

662
00:39:04,573 --> 00:39:06,570
Everybody out. Go, go, go!

663
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,320
Move it, move, move!

664
00:39:09,196 --> 00:39:10,810
Move it, move, move!

665
00:39:11,961 --> 00:39:14,045
- You said not every shadow.
- But any shadow!

666
00:39:17,406 --> 00:39:18,870
Who turned out the lights?

667
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,695
Run!

668
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:35,796
Sweetie, dinner's ready.

669
00:39:37,429 --> 00:39:39,260
Donna Noble has been saved.

670
00:39:41,349 --> 00:39:42,200
Sweetie?

671
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:06,829
<i>Trying to boost the power.</i>

672
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,160
Light doesn't stop them,
but it slows them down.

673
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:12,838
So, what's the plan? Do we have a plan?

674
00:40:13,645 --> 00:40:15,034
Your screwdriver...

675
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,210
- Looks exactly like mine.
- Yeah. You gave it to me.

676
00:40:21,374 --> 00:40:23,239
I don't give my screwdriver to anyone.

677
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:24,484
I'm not anyone.

678
00:40:25,309 --> 00:40:27,856
- Who are you?
- What's the plan?

679
00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:30,855
I teleported Donna back to the TARDIS.

680
00:40:31,198 --> 00:40:34,032
If we don't get back in five hours,
emergency program one activates.

681
00:40:34,132 --> 00:40:35,250
Take her home.

682
00:40:35,428 --> 00:40:37,542
- We need to get a shift on.
- She's not there.

683
00:40:38,495 --> 00:40:39,846
I should've received a signal,

684
00:40:40,097 --> 00:40:42,095
console signals me if
there's a teleport breach.

685
00:40:42,195 --> 00:40:44,752
Maybe the co-ordinates slipped.
The equipment here's aged.

686
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,835
Donna Noble.

687
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:50,850
There's a Donna Noble in this library,
do you have the software to locate her?

688
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,543
Donna Noble has left the Library.

689
00:40:54,131 --> 00:40:57,530
- Donna Noble has been saved.
- Donna!

690
00:40:58,386 --> 00:41:00,550
<i>Donna Noble has left the Library.</i>

691
00:41:01,126 --> 00:41:02,559
<i>Donna Noble has been saved.</i>

692
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:05,505
How can it be Donna?
