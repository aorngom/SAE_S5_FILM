sort of ship-thing,

I was just rebuilding her,
left the defences down,

113
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,080
bumped into the Titanic, here I am.

114
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,280
Bit of a party. I thought, why not?

115
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,080
I should report you. Go on, then.

116
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,480

Very funny, I'm sure.

We won our tickets in a competition.

That's it! It's marvellous!

125
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,560
But we're not good enough

127
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:47,440

Oh, ho, scared.

191

192

193

we had that big bloody spaceship.

343
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,600
Host! I'm ordering you, stop it!

344
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,680
Stop it, right now!

345
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:16,640
Deck 22 to the bridge.
Deck 22 to the bridge...

346
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:19,040
'is there anyone there? '

347
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,880
This is the bridge.

348
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,600
Oh! Hello, sailor! Good to hear you!
What's the situation up there?

349
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,200
Erm... we've got air...

350
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,560
The oxygen field is holding.
But the Captain...

351
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,440
He's dead.

352
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,400
He did it, oh, my Vot,
he took down the shields...

353
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,560
There was nothing I could do,
I tried, I did try.

354
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,680
All right, stay calm,
what's your name?

355
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,800
Midshipman Frame.

356
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,880
Nice to meet you, sir.
What's the state of the engines?

357
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,880
They're, um...

358
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,640
<i>HE GASPS</i>

359
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,320
Hold on...

360
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,960
<i>HE GROANS IN AGONY</i>

361
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,800
Have you been injured?

362
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,080
I'm all right...

363
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,520
Oh, my Vot. They're cycling down.

364
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,880
That's a Nuclear Storm drive, yes?

365
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,920
'Yeah.' The moment they're gone,
we lose orbit?

366
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,000
The planet...

367
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,000
Oh, yes.

368
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,120
If we hit the planet,
the Nuclear Storm explodes

369
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,920
and wipes out life on Earth.

370
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:29,960
I need you to fire up
the Engine Containment Field
and feed it back into the core.

371
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,400
That's never gonna work!

372
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,000
'Trust me,
it'll keep the engines going'

373
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,600
till I get there. We're gonna die!

374
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,120
Are you saying someone's
done this on purpose?

375
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,760
We're gonna die!

376
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,200
OK, OK, just hush!
First things first.

377
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,600
One,
we're gonna climb through this ship.

378
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,760
<i>B - no, two -
we're gonna reach the bridge.</i>

379
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,920
Three, or C,
we're gonna save the Titanic.

380
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,440
And coming in a very low four,
or D,

381
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:57,280
or that little "iv" in brackets
they use on footnotes - why?

382
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,920
Right, then! Follow me.

383
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,840
Hang on a minute,
who put you in charge?

384
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,960
And who the hell are you, anyway?

385
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,960
I'm the Doctor. I'm a Time Lord.

386
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:12,640
I'm from the planet Gallifrey
in the constellation of
Kasterborous,

387
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,320
I'm 903 years old, and I'm the man
who's going to save your lives

388
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,840
and all six billion people
on the planet below.

389
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,280
You got a problem with that?

390
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,960
No. In that case...

391
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,040
allons-y!

392
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,040
Careful.

393
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,120
Follow me.

394
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,440
It's rather ironic, but this is
very much in the spirit of Christmas.

395
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:01,080
It's a festival of violence!

396
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:06,040
They say that human beings
only survive depending on whether

397
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,520
they've been good or bad.
It's barbaric!

398
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:14,400
Actually, that's not true,
Christmas is a time of peace
and thanksgiving and...

399
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,600
Oh, what am I on about?
My Christmases are always like this!

400
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,400
Ah, we've got a Host!

401
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,200
Strength of ten!

402
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,040
If we can mend it,
we can use it to fix the rubble.

403
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,360
We can do robotics! Both of us!

404
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,920
We work on the Milk Market
back on Sto, it's all robot staff.

405
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,520
See if you can get it working.

406
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,600
Let's have a look...

407
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,720
It's blocked. So what do we do?

408
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,280
We shift it. That's the attitude!

409
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,280
Rickston! Mr Copper!
And you, Bannakaffalatta...

410
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:52,480
Look, can I just call you Banna?
It's gonna save a lot of time.

411
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,480
No! Bannakaffalatta!

412
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,760
All right then, Bannakaffalatta,
there's a gap, in the middle,
see if you can get through.

413
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:59,960
Easy! Good!

414
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:04,560
CRASHING

415
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,920
This whole thing
could come crashing down!

416
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,200
Oh, Rickston,
did you get that message?

417
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,400
No, what message? Shut up.

418
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,960
Bannakaffalatta made it!

419
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,480
I'm small enough,
I can get through.

420
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,680
Careful. I'm fine.

421
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:25,560
Thing is, how are Mr and Mrs Fatso
going to get through that gap?

422
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,520
We make the gap bigger. So start!

423
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,440
Hey, hey! Come on, sweetheart.

424
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,000
Don't listen to him.

425
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,400
No, but it's all my fault, though.

426
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:40,280
The tickets.
We won them, fair and square. I know.

427
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,720
I never told you...

428
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:46,600
I dialled the competition line
5,000 times.

429
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,680
That's 5,000 credits,
I might as well have paid
for the tickets.

430
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:55,200
I've been hiding the vone bill
for months now.

431
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,840
5,000 credits?

432
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,720
You spent 5,000 credits?
Don't hate me.

433
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,960
What's so funny?

434
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,840
5,000?

435
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:23,200
We'll never pay that off. I know!
We'll have to work for 20 years!

436
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,880
You mad bloody woman!

437
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,640
You're not cross?

438
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,440
Does it matter?

439
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:31,200
Well, look at us!

440
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,920
You drive me barmy!

441
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,120
I don't half love you, Mrs Van Hoff.

I can clear it from this side,
just tell me if it starts moving!

445
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,040
Bannakaffalatta, what's wrong? Sh!

446
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,360
What is it? Can't say.

447
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,120
Are you hurt?

448
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,920
Ashamed.

449
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,720
Of what? Poor Bannakaffalatta!

450
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,720
You're a cyborg!

451
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,400

Cyborgs are getting equal rights.

455
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,680

Come on, let's recharge you.

459
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,720
Just stay there for a bit.

460
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,400
Tell no-one. I promise.

461
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,040

462
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,800

don't go portside, there's no air,

We're stuck, the doors have sealed,
we can't get out.

513
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,960
Information override! What's the
origin of your command structure?

514
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,040
I can't hold it! Information deck 31.

515
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,320
Thank you!

516
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,480
<i>Let go!</i>

517
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,200
Morvin, look! Food!

518
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,960
Oh, great, someone's happy.
Don't have any, then!

519
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,040
<i>SPEAKING TUBE WHISTLES</i>

520
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:17,600
<i>SPEAKING TUBE WHISTLES
Mr Frame? Are you still there?
Yes, sir.</i>

521
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,720
But I've got Host outside,
I've sealed the door.

522
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,480
They've been programmed to kill,
why?

523
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,200
That's not the only problem, Doctor.

524
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,120
I had to use a maximum deadlock
on the door. Which means...

525
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,600
no-one can get in.

526
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,000
I'm sealed off.

527
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,480
Even if you can fix the Titanic,

528
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,320
'you can't get to the bridge.'
Yeah.

529
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:42,200
Right. Fine! One problem at a time.
What is on deck 31?

530
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:47,120
That's down below, it's nothing...

531
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:50,520
It's just the Host Storage Deck,
that's where we keep the robots.

532
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,640
But what's that? D' you see?

533
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,040
That panel of black,

534
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:59,520
it's registering... nothing.
No power, no heat, no light.

535
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:03,720
'I've never seen it before.'
100% shielded, what's down there?

536
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,640
I'll try intensifying the scanner.

537
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:07,400
Let me know if you find anything.

538
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,120
And keep those engines going!

539
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,120
Saved you some.

540
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,760
You might be a Time King from
Gaddabee, but you still need to eat.
Yeah. Thanks.

541
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,880
Though you look good for 903.

542
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,680
You should see me in the mornings.
OK.

543
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,520
Doctor! Must be well past midnight,

544
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,960
Earth time. Christmas Day.

545
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,360
So it is. Merry Christmas.

546
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,000
This Christmas thing,
what's it all about?

547
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,840
<i>Long story.</i>

548
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,120
I should know, I was there.
I got the last room.

549
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:44,360
But if the planet's waking up,
can't we signal them?

550
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,960
They could send up
a rocket or something.

551
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,320
They don't have spaceships.

552
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,280
No, I've read about it, they have
the shuffles. Space shuffles.

553
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:57,240
Mr Copper, this degree in
Earthonomics, where's it from?

554
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:03,800
Honestly? Just between us.

555
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:12,240
Mrs Golightly's Happy Travelling
University And Dry Cleaners.

556
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:16,160
D' you... You lied to the company?

557
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,400
To get the job?

558
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:21,040
I wasted my life on Sto.

559
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:26,480
I was a travelling salesman,
always on the road,

560
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:33,320
and I reached retirement with nothing
to show for it, not even a home.

561
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,840
And Earth sounded so... exotic.

562
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,600
Mm, yeah, I suppose it is, yeah.

563
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,320
How come you know it so well?

564
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,640
I was sort of, um...

565
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,520
A few years ago,
I was sort of made, well...

566
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,840
Sort of homeless, and...

567
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,120
There was the Earth.

568
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,040
The thing is, if we survive this,
there'll be police,
and all sorts of investigations...

569
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:04,360
Now the minimum penalty for
space lane fraud is ten years in jail.

570
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,720
Well, I'm an old man,

571
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,000
I won't survive ten years!

572
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,480
<i>BANGING</i>

573
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,800
<i>BANGING
Host! Move! Come on!</i>

574
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,840
Is that the only way across?

575
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,360
On the other hand,
it is a way across.

576
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,840
The engines are open.
Nuclear Storm drive.

577
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,760
Soon as it stops, the Titanic falls.

578
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:50,880
But that thing, it'll never take
our weight. You're going last, mate.

579
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:53,320
It's nitrofine metal.
It's stronger than it looks.

580
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,200
All the same, Rickston's right,
me and Foon should go la...

581
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,400
<i>HE SCREAMS
Morvin!</i>

582
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,760
I told you! I told you!

583
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,240
- Just shut up, shut up!
- Bring him back!

584
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:11,000
Can't you bring him back?
Bring him back, Doctor!

585
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,760
<i>I can't, I'm sorry, I can't.
You promised me!</i>

586
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,960
I know, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

587
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,440
Doctor, I rather think those things
have got our scent.

588
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,120
I'm not waiting. Careful!

589
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:25,240
Take it slowly!

590
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,320
<i>EXPLOSION</i>

591
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,080
Vot help me...
You're OK! Step at a time.

592
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,880
Come on. You can do it.

593
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,280
...kill, kill...

594
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:41,600
They're getting nearer.

595
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,840
I've got to seal us in...

596
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,120
Leaving us trapped, wouldn't you say?
Never say trapped. Just...

597
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
inconveniently circumstanced. Oh!

598
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:59,040
I'm OK... Maybe he's all right,
maybe there's a gravity curve

599
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,120
down there, or something,
maybe he's just unconscious...

600
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,120
<i>I'm sorry, Foon.</i>

601
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,120
<i>He's gone.</i>

602
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,560
What am I gonna do without him?

603
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,800
Yes! Oh, yes! Who's good?!

604
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,360
Bannakaffalatta, you go next.
Bannakaffalatta small! Slowly!

605
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,160
They've found us!

606
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,080
Astrid, get across, right now.

607
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,120
What about you? Just do it, go on!

608
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,120
Mr Copper, we can't wait, after you.

609
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,680
<i>Don't argue!</i>

610
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,960
<i>Foon,
you've got to get across right now.</i>

611
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,200
What for?
What am I going to do without him?

612
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,640
Doctor! The door's locked!

613
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:47,520
Just think, what would he want, eh?

614
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,360
He don't want nothing, he's dead!

615
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,920
Doctor! I can't open the door!

616
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,360
We need the whirring key thing
of yours.

617
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,920
I can't leave her! She'll get us
all killed if we can't get out!

618
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,080
Mrs Van Hoff!
I am coming back for you. All right?

619
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,200
Too many people!

620
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:19,040
Oi! Don't get spiky with me.
Keep going!

621
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:36,520
It's gonna fall! It’s just settling.
Keep going.

622
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,640
<i>POUNDING AT DOOR STOPS</i>

623
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,520
They've stopped.

624
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,160
<i>Gone away?</i>

625
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,800
Why would they give up?
Never mind that, keep coming!

626
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:52,880
But where have they gone?

627
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,400
Where are the Host?

628
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,800
I'm afraid we forgot
the traditions of Christmas...

629
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,960
that angels have wings.

630
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,480
Information. Kill.

631
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,360
Arm yourself! All of you!

632
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,120
Argh!

633
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,040
Ohhh!

634
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,960
<i>I can't...</i>

635
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,120
Bannakaffalatta, stop!

636
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,240
Bannakaffalatta proud!

637
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,240
Bannakaffalatta... cyborg!

638
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:20,120
Electromagnetic pulse
took out the robotics!

639
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,720
Oh, Bannakaffalatta,
that was brilliant!

640
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:32,080
He's used all his power.

641
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,840
Did good?

642
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,720
You saved our lives.

643
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,080
Bannakaffalatta happy.

644
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:43,720
We can recharge you, get
you to a power point, plug you in.

645
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,600
Too late.

646
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:51,000
No, but you've got to get me
that drink, remember?

647
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,880
Pretty girl.

648
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,720
I'm sorry, forgive me...

649
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:16,120
Leave him alone. It's the EMP
transmitter, he'd want us to use it.

650
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:21,760
I used to sell these things,
they'd always give me a bed for
the night, in the Cyborg Caravans.

651
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:24,160
Good people.

652
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:29,680
But if we can recharge it,
we can use it as a weapon
against the rest of the Host.

653
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,120
Bannakaffalatta might
have saved us all.

654
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,400
D' you think? Try telling him that.

655
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,320
Information. Reboot. Use the EMP!

656
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:41,680
It's dead.
It's gotta have emergency...!

657
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:45,400
No! Hold on! Override! Loophole!
Security Protocol... ten!

658
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,880
666? Uh, 21? 4, 5, 6, 7, 8?
I don't know, 42?

659
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,120
<i>Erm...one!</i>

660
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,280

661
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,760
Good!

662
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,640
Right. You've been ordered
to kill the survivors, but why?

663
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,000
Information. No witnesses.

664
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,360
But this ship's gonna
kill everyone on Earth,

665
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,960
the human race has nothing
to do with the Titanic,
that contravenes your orders!

666
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,640
Information. Incorrect. But...

667
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,080
Why destroy the Earth? Information.
It is the plan. What plan?

668
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:26,200
Information. Protocol grants you
only three questions, these
three questions have been used.

669
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,600
Well, you could've warned me!

670
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:30,960
Information. Now you will die.

671
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,040
You're coming with me.

672
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,800
<i>NO!!!</i>

673
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,640
<i>No more.</i>

674
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,680
Get yourselves
up to reception one,

675
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:10,840
once you're there, Mr Copper,

676
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,640
try to find a way of transmitting
an SOS.

677
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:17,040
Astrid, take this, powered up,
it'll take out Host within 50 yards,

678
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,200
but then it needs 60 seconds
to recharge.

679
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,320
Rickston, take this...

680
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:25,920
I've pre-set it, just hold down
that button, it'll open the doors.
Do NOT lose it, got that?

681
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,760
Now go and open the next door.

682
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,440
Go on, go! All right!

683
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:34,280
Mr Copper, I need you fighting fit.
Astrid, where's the power points?
Under the comms.

684
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,360
When it's ready,
that blue light comes on, there.

685
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,480
You're talking
as if you're not coming with us.

686
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,160
I'm gonna find out
what's on deck 31.

687
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:47,240
What if you meet a Host?
Well, I’ll just... have some fun!

688
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,880
Sounds like you do this
kind of thing all the time.

689
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,640
Not by choice.

690
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:55,160
All I do is travel,
that's what I am, just a traveller.

691
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:56,680
Imagine it!

692
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,880
No tax, no bills, no boss.

693
00:45:58,920 --> 00:46:00,760
Just the open sky.

694
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,960
I'm sort of...

695
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,200
unemployed now.

696
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:11,280
I was thinking, that blue box
is kind of small, but...

697
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,800
I could squeeze in it.
Like a stowaway.

698
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,960
It's not always safe. So you
need someone to take care of you.

699
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:21,520
I've got no-one back on Sto,
no family. Just me.

700
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,120
So what d' you think?

701
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,360
Can I come with you?

702
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,120
Yeah. I'd like that, yeah.

703
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,160
<i>EXPLOSION</i>

704
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:41,240
Mr Frame, are you still with us?

705
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,320
It's the engines, sir. Final phase!

706
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:46,440
There's nothing more I can do,
we've only eight minutes left.

707
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,560
Don't worry, I'll get there.
But the bridge is sealed off!

708
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,760
Yeah, yeah! Working on it!
I'll get there, Mr Frame. Somehow!

709
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,960
All charged up!

710
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,120
Mr Copper, look after her.
Astrid, look after him.

711
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:03,760
Rickston, erm... Look after yourself.

712
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,160
And I'll see you again.

713
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,480
I promise. Hold on.

714
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,640
There's an old tradition
on Planet Sto...

715
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,800
I have really got to go.
Just wait a minute.

716
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,040
Yeah, that's a... very old tradition,
yeah.

717
00:47:26,120 --> 00:47:27,160
See you later.

718
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,120
Oh, yes.

719
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,360
Do it!

720
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,840
Wait, wait!
Security Protocol One!

721
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:08,520
D' you hear me? One! One!

722
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,280
OK. That gives me three questions.

723
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,160
Three questions to save my life,
am I right?

724
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,920
Information. Correct.

725
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:21,480
No, that wasn't one of them,
I didn't mean it, that's not fair!

726
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,600
Can I start again? Information. No.

727
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:28,400
No, no, no, that wasn't
a question either! Blimey.

728
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:31,400
One question left. One question.

729
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,760
So! You've been given orders to kill
the survivors, but survivors must
therefore be passengers or staff,

730
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,200
but not me, I'm not a passenger,
I'm not staff, go on, scan me,

731
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:45,640
you must have bio-records, no such
person on board, I don't exist,

732
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:49,360
therefore, you can't kill me,
therefore, I'm a stowaway,

733
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:54,600
and stowaways should be arrested
and taken to the nearest figure
of authority,

734
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:00,640
and I reckon the nearest figure
of authority is on deck 31.

735
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:03,560
Final question - am I right?!

736
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,360
Information. Correct.

737
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,320
Brilliant!

738
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,000
Take me to your leader!

739
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:12,320
I've always wanted to say that.

740
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,280
Rickston, seal the doors,
make the room secure.

741
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,400
Mr Copper, keep an eye on the Host,
I need to check the computer,

742
00:49:34,440 --> 00:49:36,080
we need that SOS!

743
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:55,040
Bridge... this is Reception One.

744
00:49:55,080 --> 00:50:01,840
Who's that? Astrid Peth - I was
with the Doctor. Tell me, can you
divert power to the teleport system?

745
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:04,800
No way. I'm using everything
for the engines.

746
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,760
It's just one trip,
I need to get to deck 31.

747
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,840
And I'm telling you, no!

748
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,680
<i>Mr Frame.</i>

749
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,880
This is for the Doctor.

750
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:21,120
He's gone down there,
on his own, and I...

751
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,600
I can't just leave him.

752
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,160
'He's done everything
he can to save us... '

753
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,440
It's time we did something
to help him.

754
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:35,400
'Giving you power.'

755
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:42,240
Mr Copper. I'm going to find him.

756
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,000
Good luck.

757
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:01,880
Wow.

758
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,480
<i>Now...</i>

759
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,400
that is what you'd call
a fixer-upper.

760
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,200
Come on, then, Host with the most.

761
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:12,080
This ultimate authority
of yours, who is it?

762
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:15,720
Oh, that's clever.

763
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,280
That's an Omnistate Impact Chamber.

764
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:25,600
Indestructible! You could
survive anything, in there,
you could sit through a supernova.

765
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,360
Or a shipwreck.

766
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:33,400
But only one person could have
the power and the money to hide
themselves on board like this.

767
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,480
And I should know, cos...

768
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,400
My name is Max.

769
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,560
It really does that?! Who the hell
is this? I'm the Doctor, hello!

770
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,400
Information. Stowaway.

771
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,760
Well... Kill him.

772
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,120
Oh, no, no, no, no, wait!

773
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,320
<i>But you can't, not now,
come on! Max!</i>

774
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,840
You're giving me so much
good material! Like...

775
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:56,560
how to get a head in business.

776
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,800
D' you see? Head? Head?

777
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,320
Head? No?

778
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,400
Ho, ho! The office joker.

779
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,000
I like a funny man.

780
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,920
No-one's been funny
with me for years.

781
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,280
I can't think why.

782
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:14,680
176 years of running the company
have taken their toll.

783
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:17,400
Yeah, but... nice wheels.

784
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,080
No. A life-support system,

785
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:24,000
in a society that despises cyborgs.

786
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:28,880
I've had to hide away for years,
running the company by hologram.
Host!

787
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,760
Situation report!

788
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,840
Information.
Titanic is still in orbit.

789
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:38,040
<i>Let me see...</i>

790
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:44,920
We should've crashed by now,
what's gone wrong?

791
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,920
The engines are still running,
they should have stopped!

792
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,800
When they do, Earth gets roasted...
What's Earth got to do with it?

793
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:58,440
This interview is terminated.

794
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:03,440
<i>No, no, no, no!
But hold on, hold on, wait!</i>

795
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:07,920
I can work it out, it's like a task,
I'm your apprentice,
just watch me...

796
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,760
<i>So!</i>

797
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:14,160
The business is failing, you wreck
the ship, that makes things even
worse... Oh! Yes!

798
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:15,920
<i>No.</i>

799
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,560
Yes!

800
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:22,080
The business isn't failing,
it's failed, past tense!

801
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:26,600
My own board voted me out,
stabbed me in the back.

802
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,920
If you had a back. So!
You scupper the ship,

803
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,400
wipe out any survivors,
just in case anyone's rumbled you...

804
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:35,320
and the board find
their shares halved in value.

805
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,760
Oh, but that's not enough!

806
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:46,400
No. Cos if a Max Capricorn ship
hits the Earth,
it destroys an entire planet...

807
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,800
Outrage back home, scandal!

808
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:51,120
The business is wiped out!

809
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:56,120
And... the whole board thrown
in jail, for mass murder.

810
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:01,080
While you sit there,
safe inside the Impact Chamber.

811
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:05,560
I have men waiting to retrieve me
from the ruins,

812
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:11,280
and enough off world accounts
to retire me to the beaches
of Penhaxico Two.

813
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:17,360
Where the ladies, so I'm told,
are very fond of... metal.

814
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,360
So that's the plan.

815
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,320
A retirement plan!

816
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,400
2, 000 people on this ship,

817
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:27,960
six billion underneath us,
all of them slaughtered, and why?

818
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,520
Because Max Capricorn is a loser!

819
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:36,280
I never lose!
You can't even sink the Titanic!

820
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:38,200
Oh, but I can, Doctor!

821
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,840
I can cancel the engines from here.

822
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:44,360

Not so clever now, Doctor.

it seems that, this year,

the City of London has escaped

01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:14,000
The Queen has remained
in residence, in defiance
of extraterrestrial attack...

Listen to me! Security Code 7711,
now get out of there!

881
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:18,480
Mr Copper, the teleports, have
they got an emergency setting?

882
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,400
I don't know, they should have.
She fell, Mr Copper.

883
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:26,200
What's the emergency code? Let me...
What the hell are you doing?
We can bring her back!

884
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:30,960
If a passenger has an accident
on shore leave and they're
still wearing their teleport,

885
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:36,560
their molecules are suspended
and held in stasis, so if we can just
trigger the shift. There!

886
01:02:36,600 --> 01:02:39,960
I'm falling.
Only halfway there. Come on!

887
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:46,160
<i>I keep falling. Feedback

01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:49,800

Doctor... If I can just link
up the surface suspension.

889
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:55,720
Doctor, she's gone.
I just need to override the safety.
I can do this, I can do it. Doctor.

890
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:58,120
Let her go.

891
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:05,720
I can do anything! Stop me falling.

892
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:16,840
There's not enough left,
the system was too badly damaged.

893
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,080
She's just atoms, Doctor.

894
01:03:22,680 --> 01:03:28,520
An echo, with the
ghost of consciousness.

895
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:31,040

There's an old tradition.

01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,960
Now you can travel forever.

01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:27,640
You're not falling, Astrid.
You're flying.

901
01:04:54,840 --> 01:05:00,720
The engines have stabilised,
we're holding steady till we
get help and I've sent the SOS.

902
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:03,280
A rescue ship should be here
within twenty minutes.

903
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:07,480
And they're digging out
the records on Max Capricorn.
Should be quite a story.

904
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:12,920
They'll want to talk to all of us,
I suppose? I'd have thought so, yeah.

905
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:19,680
I think one or two inconvenient
truths might come to light.

906
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,920
Still, it's my own fault.

907
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,920
And ten years in jail
is better than dying.

thank you.

911
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:43,800
The funny thing is...

912
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,160
...I said Max Capricorn
was falling apart.

913
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,200
Just before the crash,

914
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:52,160
I sold all my shares.

915
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:55,440
Transferred them to his rivals.

916
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:59,600
It's made me rich.

01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:17,000
Of all the people to
survive, he's not the one
you would have chosen, is he?

920
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:23,960
But if you could choose, Doctor,
if you could decide who
lives and who dies...

921
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:27,920
...that would make you a monster.

923
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:39,600
I think you deserve one of these.

924
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:07,760
So, Great Britain
is part of Yooropee,

925
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:10,560
and just across the British Channel,

926
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,680
you've got Great France
and Great Germany.

927
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:17,440
No, no, it's just France and
Germany, only Britain is Great.

928
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:21,360
And they're all at war
with the continent of Hamerica?

929
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:26,520
No. Well, not yet. (You could
argue that one.) There she is!

930
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,480
Survive anything!

931
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:35,280
You know, between you and me,
I don't even think this snow is real,

932
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:42,240
I think it's the ballast
from the Titanic's salvage
entering the atmosphere.

933
01:07:44,040 --> 01:07:48,960
Yeah. One of these days,
it might snow for real.

934
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:51,840
So! I suppose you'll be off?

935
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:54,480
The open sky.

936
01:07:54,520 --> 01:07:56,720
And... what about me?

937
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:01,720
I travel alone. It's best that way.

938
01:08:03,960 --> 01:08:06,560
What am I supposed to do?

939
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:09,160
Give me that credit card.

940
01:08:10,680 --> 01:08:12,440
Well, it's just petty cash.

941
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,840
Spending money.

942
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:20,360
It's all done by computer,
I didn't really know the currency so
I thought a million might cover it.

943
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,120
A million? Pounds?

944
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:23,880
Enough for trinkets.

945
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:29,400
Mr Copper, a million pounds
is worth 50 million credits.

946
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:35,720
How much?! 50 million and 56.

01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:09,480
No interfering.
I don't want any trouble.

Um... where are you going?

I do not understand, Miss.

01:11:00,040 --> 01:11:02,840
Why do you say "Miss"?
