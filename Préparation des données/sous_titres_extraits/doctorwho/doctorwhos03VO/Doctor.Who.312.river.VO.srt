1
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,560
Oh, my head.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,800
Time travel without a capsule,
that's a killer.

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,120
Oh...

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,320
Still, at least we made it.

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,280
Earth, 21st century
by the looks of it.

6
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,080
Talk about lucky.
That wasn't luck. That was me.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,800
Hold it still, don't move.

8
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:34,360
Hold it still. I'm telling you, it's
broken. It hasn't worked for years.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,560
That's because you didn't have me.
Martha, grab hold. Now!

10
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,840
The moral is, if you're gonna get
stuck at the end of the universe,

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,240
get stuck with an ex time agent
and his vortex manipulator.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:48,360
But this Master bloke,
he's got the TARDIS.

13
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,480
He could be anywhere in time
and space. No, he's here.

14
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,880
Trust me. Who is he, anyway?

15
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,920
That voice at the end,
that wasn't the Professor.

16
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,600
If the Master's a Time Lord,
he must have regenerated.

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:58,680
What does that mean?

18
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:03,080
It means he's changed his face,
voice, body - everything. A new man.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,960
Time Lords always do. But hold on...
If he could be anyone...

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,360
We missed the election.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,720
But it can't be.

22
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,080
Mr Saxon has returned
from the Palace,

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,160
and is greeting the crowds
inside Saxon Headquarters.

24
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,840
I said I knew that voice
when he spoke inside the TARDIS.

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,520
I've heard that voice hundreds
of times! We've all seen him!

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,560
That was the voice of Harold Saxon.

27
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,120
That's him.

28
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,880
He's Prime Minister.

29
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,160
The Master is Prime Minister
of Great Britain.

30
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,400
The Master and his wife!

31
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,720
This country has been sick.

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,000
This country needs healing.

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,400
This country needs medicine.

34
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,680
In fact, I'd go so far as to say

35
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,040
that what this country
really needs right now...

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,680
is a Doctor.

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,040
Finance report, sir. Military
protocol, sir. EC directive, sir.

38
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,560
Annual budget, sir.
Policy recommendations.

39
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,360
I'm so proud of you, Harry.

40
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,680
Bless.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,560
Sir, if you don't mind me asking...
I'm sorry, but it's all a bit new.

42
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,800
Letitia Jones... Sir. Tish!

43
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,280
Well, then, Tish.

44
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,600
You just stand there
and look gorgeous.

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:24,120
A glorious day.
Downing Street, rebuilt.

46
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,280
The Cabinet in session.

47
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,720
Let the work of government begin.

48
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,200
Oh, go on, crack a smile.

49
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,640
It's funny, isn't it? Albert?

50
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,040
Funny? No? Little bit?

51
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,600
Very funny, sir.

52
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,960
But if we could
get down to business,

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,840
there is the matter of policy,
of which we have very little.

54
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,680
No, no, no, no. Before we start
all that, I just want to say...

55
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,280
Thank you. Thank you, one and all,

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,280
you ugly fat-faced bunch of wet,
snivelling traitors.

57
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:12,280
Yes, quite... Very funny.

58
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,520
Hm...

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,840
You see, I'm not making myself
very clear. Funny is like this...

60
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,680
Not funny is like this...

61
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,480
And right now I'm not like...

62
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,320
I'm like...

63
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,840
Because you are traitors.

64
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,080
Yes, you are! As soon as you
saw the vote swinging my way,

65
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,360
you abandoned your parties and you
jumped on the Saxon bandwagon. So!

66
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,880
This is your reward.

67
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,440
Excuse me, Prime Minister, do you
mind my asking - what is that?

68
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,680
MUFFLED: A gas mask.
I beg your pardon?

69
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,320
It's a gas mask.

70
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,520
Yes, but, um...
why are you wearing it?

71
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,320
MUFFLED SPEECH

72
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,040
I'm sorry?

73
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,480
Because of the gas. What gas?

74
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,760
MUFFLED: This gas.

75
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,640
You're insane!

76
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,840
RHYTHMIC TAPPING

77
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,240
Home... What have you got,
computer, laptop, anything?

78
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,800
jack, who are you phoning?
You can't tell anyone we're here!

79
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,040
just some friends,
but there's no reply. Any good?

80
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,120
I can show you the Saxon websites.
He's been around for ages...

81
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,680
That's so weird.
It's the day after the election.

82
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,560
That's only four days
after I met you.

83
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,400
We went flying
all round the universe.

84
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,280
While he was here all the time.

85
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:59,280
You gonna tell us who he is?
He's a Time Lord.

86
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:04,640
What about the rest of it? I mean,
who'd call himself "The Master"?
That's all you need to know.

87
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
Come on, show me Harold Saxon.

88
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,920
'Martha, where are you?
I've got this new job!

89
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,400
You won't believe it, they phoned me
out of the blue, I'm working for...

90
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,080
Oh, like it matters! I'm sorry,
but you're not allowed in.

91
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,440
Harold Saxon, a modern Churchill...

92
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,400
It's the definitive think-piece
on the great man himself.

93
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,480
Oh, come on, sweetheart,
you must've read it!

94
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,680
Um, not really, sorry, I'm new.
Mr Saxon does like a pretty face.

95
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,560
But I'm here to see Mrs Saxon.
You can't just go barging in.

96
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,040
Mrs Saxon, Vivien Rook,
Sunday Mirror.

97
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,800
You've heard of me.
Can't I just have an hour to myself?

98
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:34,960
It's been a hell of a day.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,520
Oh, strike while the iron's hot,
that's what I say, Lucy...

100
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,800
I can call you Lucy, can't I?

101
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:43,000
Now everyone's talking about
Harold Saxon, but I thought...

102
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,240
what about the wife?
All I need is 20 minutes.

103
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,720
I think maybe we should wait.

104
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,920
Oh, the headline's
waiting to print...

105
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
The Power Behind The Throne.

106
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,120
Really? Britain's First Lady.

107
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,200
Gosh! Front page. Oh. Well.

108
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,600
I suppose...
Ohh, go on then, 20 minutes!

109
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:05,720
Excellent! Thank you!
Oh, oh, what was it... Oh, Tish...

110
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,560
Now you can leave us alone.

111
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,560
No, but... I'm supposed to sit in.

112
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,520
No no... it's only a profile piece,

113
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,000
you know, hair
and clothes and nonsense.

114
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,040
There's a good girl,
out you go, that's it.

115
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,480
Mrs Saxon, I have reason to believe

116
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,920
that you're in very great danger.

117
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,920
All of us, in fact... not just
the country, but the whole world.

118
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,160
No, I beg of you. Hear me out.
What are you talking about?

119
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,040
Your husband is not
who he says he is. I'm sorry.

120
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,960
But it's a lie.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,880
Everything's a lie.

122
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,680
I'm voting Saxon.

123
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,240
He can tick my box, any day!

124
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,160
Vote Saxon! Go Harry!

125
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,600
I think Mr Saxon is exactly
what this country needs.

126
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,760
He's a very fine man...

127
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,840
and he's handsome, too.

128
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:08,480
Former Minister of Defence, first
came to prominence when he shot down
the Racnoss on Christmas Eve...

129
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,280
But he goes back years. He's famous.
Everyone knows the story.

130
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,800
Look.

131
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,160
Cambridge University, rugby blue,
won the athletics thing,

132
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,240
wrote a novel, went into business,
marriage, everything,

133
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
he's got a whole life.

134
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,560
All of it, the school days, his
degree, even his mother and father,

135
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,800
it's all invented.

136
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:32,160
Look, Harold Saxon
never went to Cambridge,

137
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,160
there was no Harold Saxon!

138
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,120
The thing is, it's obvious.

139
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,080
The forgery is screaming out,
and yet no-one can see it!

140
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,440
It's as if he's mesmerised
the entire world.

141
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,680
I think perhaps you
should leave now.

142
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:46,440
18 months ago, he became real.

143
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,960
This is his first honest
to God appearance,

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,400
just after the downfall
of Harriet Jones.

145
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:00,000
And at the exact same time,
they launched the Archangel network.

146
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,120
Mrs Rook, now stop it.
Even now, they've said that the...

147
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,960
the Cabinet's gone into seclusion.

148
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,800
What does that mean, seclusion?
How should I know?

149
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,600
But I've got plenty
of research on you.

150
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,120
Yes, good family, Roedean,
not especially bright,

151
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:17,760
but essentially harmless,

152
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,000
and that's why I'm asking you, Lucy,
I am begging you,

153
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,080
if you have seen anything,
heard anything,

154
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,360
even the slightest thing, that
would give you cause to doubt him.
I think...

155
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,080
Yes?

156
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,000
There was a time, when we first met,
I wondered...

157
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,360
But he was so good to my father,
and he said...

158
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,640
What? just tell me, sweetheart.
The thing is...

159
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,160
I made my choice. I'm sorry?

160
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,160
For better or for worse.

161
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,240
Isn't that right, Harry?

162
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:57,200
My faithful companion.

163
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,480
Mr Saxon.

164
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,760
Prime Minister. I was just...

165
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:07,520
having a little joke with poor
little Lucy, I didn't mean...

166
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,880
Oh, but you're absolutely right.

167
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,240
Harold Saxon doesn't exist.

168
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,360
Then tell me.

169
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,160
Who are you? I am the Master.

170
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,240
And these are my friends.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,360
I'm sorry.

172
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,400
Can't you hear it, Mrs Rook?

173
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,800
What d'you mean?

174
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,120
The drumbeat.

175
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,720
The drums are coming closer

176
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,760
and closer...

177
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:49,080
The lady doesn't like us. No...

178
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,240
Silly lady. No...

179
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,920
Dead lady.

180
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,480
SCREAMING CONTINUES

181
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,760
Harry, she knew everything!

182
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,560
You promised,
you said Archangel was 100%.

183
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,560
Um. 99. 98?

184
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,240
But if she's asking questions,
then who else?

185
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,560
How much time have we got?

186
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,800
Tomorrow morning, I promise.

187
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,640
That's when everything ends.

188
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,520
But he's got the TARDIS...

189
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,280
Maybe the Master went back in time,
and has been living here for decades.

190
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,120
No. Why not? Worked for me.

191
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,840
When he was stealing the TARDIS, all
I could do was fuse the coordinates.

192
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,680
I locked them, permanently.

193
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:55,880
He can only travel between
the year 100,000,000,000, and
the last place the TARDIS landed.

194
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,400
Which is right here, right now.
Yeah, but... a little leeway?

195
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,600
Well, 18 months.

196
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,440
Tops. The most he could have
been here is 18 months.

197
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,680
So how's he managed all this?

198
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,240
The Master was always
sort of hypnotic,

199
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,760
but this is on a massive scale.

200
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,200
I was gonna vote for him. Really?
Well, it was before I even met you.

201
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,920
And I liked him. Me, too.

202
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,600
Why d'you say that?

203
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,440
What was his policy,
what did he stand for?

204
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,000
I dunno, he always sounded... good.

205
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,760
Like you could trust him.

206
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,960
just nice.

207
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,120
He spoke about...

208
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,240
I can't really remember,
but it was good.

209
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,120
just the sound of his voice...
What's that? What?

210
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,000
That! That tapping.
What are you doing?

211
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:45,320
I don't know, it's nothing,
it’s just... I don't know!

212
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,120
INTRO MUSIC BLARES

213
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,360
Our Lord and Master is
speaking to his kingdom.

214
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,560
Britain, Britain, Britain.

215
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,120
What extraordinary times we've had.

216
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,440
just a few years ago,
this world was so small.

217
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,960
And then they came.
Out of the unknown.

218
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,600
Falling from the skies.
You've seen it happen...

219
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,600
Big Ben, destroyed.

220
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,240
A spaceship over London.

221
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:12,000
All those ghosts and metal men,
the Christmas Star...

222
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,000
that came to kill.

223
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,000
Time and time again,
and the Government told you nothing.

224
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,240
Well, not me! Not Harold Saxon!

225
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,480
Because my purpose here today
is to tell you this.

226
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,680
Citizens of Great Britain...

227
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,400
I have been contacted.

228
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,480
A message, for humanity,
from beyond the stars.

229
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,320
People of the Earth.
We come in peace.

230
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,120
We bring you great gifts!

231
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,320
We bring technology
and wisdom and protection.

232
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
And all we ask in return
is your friendship.

233
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,720
Aw! Sweet.

234
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,600
And this species
has identified itself.

235
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,440
They're called the Toclafane. What?!

236
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,440
And tomorrow morning,
they will appear. Not in secret!

237
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,640
But to all of you.

238
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,680
Diplomatic relations
with a new species will begin.

239
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:08,880
Tomorrow, we take our place
in the universe.

240
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,720
Every man, woman and child,
every teacher and chemist

241
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:18,560
and lorry driver and farmer
and, oh, I don't know, every...

242
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,800
Medical student?

243
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,480
Out!

244
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,480
BEEPING

245
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,400
BEEPING QUICKENS

246
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,280
All right?
Fine, yeah, fine... Martha?

247
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,000
What are you doing? He knows
about me, what about my family?!

248
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,720
Don't tell them anything.
I'll do what I like!

249
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,920
Mum! Oh, my God, you're there.

250
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,520
Course I'm here, sweetheart.
You all right?

251
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,720
I'm fine, I'm fine... Mum, has
there been anyone asking about me?

252
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,920
Martha, I think, perhaps you
should come round. I can't, not now.

253
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,400
It's your father, we've been talking,
and we thought we might give it a go.

254
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,760
Don't be so daft, since when?
just come round.

255
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,280
Come to the house. We can celebrate.

256
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,080
You'd never get back with him in
a million years. Ask him yourself.

257
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,200
Martha. It's me.
Dad? What are you doing there?

258
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,680
Like your mother said. Come
round, we can explain everything.

259
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,800
Dad. just say yes, or no.

260
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,920
Is there someone else there?

261
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,560
Yes! just run! Clive!
Listen to me, just run!

262
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,640
You stupid man,
we're trying to help her...

263
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,360
Martha, don't listen to him.
What's going on, Dad?!

264
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,040
He's dangerous! We've got
to get Martha away from him.

265
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,520
I've gotta help them.

266
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,200
That's exactly what they want,
it's a trap! I don't care!

267
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,880
Get off!

268
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,240
It is your fault! All of you!

269
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:57,040
You voted Saxon! You did this!

270
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,920
Corner!

271
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,240
BRAKES SCREECH

272
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,200
Mr Saxon, we have Condition Red
on the Jones Plan.

273
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,160
We're taking them in.

274
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,280
All of them. But I was helping you!

275
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,120
Come on, Tish, pick up.

276
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,320
Martha, can't talk now, we've just
made First Contact, did you see?

277
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:25,280
What are you doing?
Get off! Linda, tell them!

278
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:28,680
What's happening? Tish?! It's
your fault, it's all your fault.

279
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,800
I was helping you! Get off me!

280
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,080
Martha! Get out of here, get out!

281
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,040
Target identified! Martha, reverse!

282
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,440
Take aim! Get out, now! Fire!

283
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,920
Take him away!

284
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,080
The only place he can go is
Planet Earth! Great idea! Careful!

285
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,160
Martha. Listen to me, do as I say.
We've gotta ditch this car.

286
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
Pull over. Right now!

287
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,520
Martha, come on! Leo!

288
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,600
Thank God. Leo, you've
gotta listen to me. Where are you?

289
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,920
I'm in Brighton.
Yeah we came down with Boxer.

290
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,440
Did you see that Saxon thing
on telly?

291
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,800
Leo, listen to me,
don't go home, I'm telling you,

292
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:30,160
don't phone mum, or dad,
or Tish, you've gotta hide.

293
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,240
Shut up.
On my life, you've gotta trust me.

294
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,360
Go to Boxer's, stay with him,
don't tell anyone, just hide.

295
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,360
Ooh, nice little game of
hide and seek, I love that!

296
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,680
But I'll find you, Martha Jones.

297
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,600
Been a long time since we saw
each other, must be, what...

298
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,720
100 trillion years?

299
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,760
Let them go, Saxon!

300
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,840
Do you hear me?! Let them go!

301
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,720
I'm here.

302
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,000
Doctor.

303
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,640
Master.

304
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,600
I like it when you use my name.
You chose it.

305
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,280
Psychiatrist's field day.

306
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,120
As you chose yours.

307
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,680
The man who makes people better.

308
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,480
How sanctimonious is that?

309
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,200
So...

310
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,200
Prime Minister, then.
I know! It's good, isn't it?

311
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,960
Who are those creatures?

312
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,040
There's no such thing as the
Toclafane, that’s just a made-up
name, like the bogeyman.

313
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,800
Do you remember all those
fairytales about the Toclafane
when we were kids?

314
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,520
Back home?

315
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:43,800
Where is it, Doctor?

316
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,960
Gone. How can Gallifrey be gone?

317
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,640
It burnt.

318
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,960
And the Time Lords?

319
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,320
Dead.

320
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,560
And the Daleks...

321
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,560
More or less.

322
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,440
What happened to you?

323
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,440
The Time Lords only resurrected me

324
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,840
because they knew I'd be the
perfect warrior for a Time War.

325
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,240
I was there when the Dalek Emperor
took control of the Cruciform.

326
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,480
I saw it.

327
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,120
I ran.

328
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
I ran so far.

329
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:28,920
Made myself human,
so they would never find me,

330
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,880
because...

331
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,080
I was so scared.

332
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,480
I know.

333
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,720
All of them?

334
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,440
But not you. Which must mean...

335
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,360
I was the only one who could end it.

336
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,760
And I tried...
I did, I tried everything...

337
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,440
What did it feel like, though?

338
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,640
Two almighty civilisations burning.

339
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,960
Ohh, tell me, how did that feel?

340
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,760
Stop it!
You must have been like God.

341
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,480
I've been alone ever since.

342
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,320
But not any more.

343
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,560
Don't you see?
All we've got is each other.

344
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,400
Are you asking me out on a date?
You could stop this, right now!

345
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,200
We could leave this planet, we can
fight across the constellations,

346
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,160
if that's what you want.
But not on Earth!

347
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,240
Too late.

348
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Why d'you say that? The drumming.

349
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,560
Can't you hear it? I thought it
would stop, but it never does.

350
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,720
It never, ever stops, inside my head.

351
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:39,320
The drumming, Doctor,
the constant drumming.

352
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,600
I could help you,
please let me help.

353
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,800
It's everywhere.

354
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,160
Listen, listen, listen!

355
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,560
HE TAPS THE DESK

356
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,920
Here come the drums.

357
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,120
Here come...

358
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,280
the drums.

359
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,320
What have you done?

360
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,800
Tell me how you've done this?
What are those creatures? Tell me!

361
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,160
Ooh look, you're on TV!
Stop it! Answer me!

362
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,720
No, really, you're on telly!

363
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,240
You and your little band,

364
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,320
which, by the way, is ticking
every demographic box.

365
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,920
So congratulations on that.

366
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,640
Look, there you are! '... also
identifies himself as The Captain.

367
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,720
'They are known to be armed
and extremely dangerous.'

368
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,240
You're public enemies
number one, two and three!

369
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,440
Oh, and you can tell Handsome jack

370
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:33,520
that I've sent his little gang
off on a wild goose chase
to the Himalayas,

371
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,880
so he won't be getting
any help from them.

372
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:41,440
Now go on, off you go. Why not
start by turning to the right?

373
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,040
He can see us!

374
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,280
Ooh, you public menace!

375
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,680
Better start running! Go on! Run!

376
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,120
He's got control of everything.
What do we do?

377
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,400
We've got nowhere to go.

378
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,640
Doctor, what do we do?!

379
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,840
'Run, Doctor! '

380
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:06,000
Run for your life!

381
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,480
We run.

382
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,040
I said, "RUN!"

383
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,560
Tomorrow morning,
Britain will be welcoming
an extraterrestrial species...

384
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,600
The President is said to be furious
that Great Britain has taken
unilateral action...

385
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,600
HE SPEAKS CANTONESE

386
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,960
THE MASTER LAUGHS

387
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,920
Have you seen these things?

388
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,840
This planet's amazing.

389
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,680
Television... in their stomach.

390
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,880
Now that is evolution!

391
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,160
Is the Machine ready?

392
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,360
Tomorrow morning.

393
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,120
It reaches critical at 8.02
precisely.

394
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:08,600
We have to escape! Because
it's coming, sir, the darkness!

395
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,480
The never-ending darkness!

396
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,360
The terrible, terrible cold!
We have to run and run and run...

397
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,160
Eight o'clock, tomorrow morning.

398
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:23,040
Tell your people...
the world is waiting.

399
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,520
How was it? I don't think
anyone saw me. Anything new?

400
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:46,320
This is tuned into the government
wavelength to see what Saxon's doing.
I meant about my family!

401
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:49,760
Still says the Jones family
taken in for questioning.

402
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,320
Tell you what, though.

403
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,040
No mention of Leo.
He's not as daft as he looks.

404
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,360
I'm talking about my brother
on the run. How did this happen?

405
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,920
Nice chips.
Actually, they're not bad.

406
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
So, Doctor...

407
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,440
Who is he?

408
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,320
How come the Ancient Society of
Time Lords created a psychopath?

409
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:18,160
And what is he to you?
Like a colleague or...?
A friend, at first.

410
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,000
I thought you were gonna say he was
your secret brother or something.

411
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,040
You've been watching too much TV.

412
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,160
All the legends of Gallifrey
made it sound so perfect.
Well, perfect to look at, maybe.

413
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,120
And it was. It was beautiful.

414
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:38,080
They used to call it the Shining
World of the Seven Systems...

415
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,600
and on the continent
of Wild Endeavour...

416
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:44,680
in the mountains
of Solace and Solitude...

417
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,680
there stood
the Citadel of the Time Lords...

418
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,640
...the oldest and most mighty
race in the universe...

419
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,920
...Looking down
on the galaxies below.

420
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,640
Sworn never to interfere.

421
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,120
Only to watch.

422
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:06,440
Children of Gallifrey,

423
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,720
taken from their families at the
age of eight, to enter the Academy.

424
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,640
Some say that's where it all began.

425
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,840
When he was a child.

426
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,720
That's when the Master saw eternity.

427
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,240
As a novice,
he was taken for initiation.

428
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,040
He stood in front
of the Untempered Schism -

429
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,120
it's a gap
in the fabric of reality,

430
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,000
through which could be seen
the whole of the Vortex.

431
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,440
You stand there.

432
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,560
Eight years old.

433
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,360
Staring at the raw power
of time and space. just a child.

434
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,960
Some would be inspired.

435
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,320
Some would run away.

436
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,280
And some would go mad.

437
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,960
Oh, I don't know. What about you?

438
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,080
Oh, the ones that ran away.

439
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,880
I never stopped.

440
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,600
BEEPING

441
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,320
Encrypted channel,
with files attached.

442
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,440
Don't recognise it...
Patch it through to the laptop.

443
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:27,800
Um, since we're telling stories,
there's something I haven't told you.

444
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,600
You work for Torchwood?
It's changed. There's only
half a dozen of us now...

445
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,800
Everything Torchwood did and
you're part of it?! The old regime
was destroyed at Canary Wharf.

446
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,840
I rebuilt it, I changed it
and when I did that, I did it
for you. In your honour.

447
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:00,520
If I haven't returned
to my desk by 22.00, this file
will be e-mailed to Torchwood,

448
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,320
which means, if you're
watching this, then I'm...

449
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,880
Anyway,
the Saxon files are attached.

450
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,680
But take a look
at the Archangel document.

451
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,440
That's when it all started,
when Harry Saxon

452
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,720
became Minister in charge of
launching the Archangel Network.

453
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,440
What's the Archangel Network?

454
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,120
I've got Archangel, everyone does.
The mobile phone network. Look.

455
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,880
It's gone worldwide.
15 satellites in orbit.

456
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:27,320
Even the other networks,
they're all carried by Archangel.

457
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,880
It's in the phones!
Oh, I said he was a hypnotist!

458
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:33,760
Wait, wait, wait, hold on...

459
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,440
RHYTHMIC BEEPING
There it is.

460
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,240
That rhythm. It's everywhere.

461
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,960
Ticking away in the subconscious.

462
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,880
What is it, mind control?
No, subtler than that. Any stronger
and people would question it.

463
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,760
But contained in that rhythm,
in layers of code, "Vote Saxon.
Believe in me."

464
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:55,560
Whispering to the world. Oh! Yes!
That's how he hid himself from me!

465
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,240
I should've sensed another
Time Lord on Earth,
but the signal cancelled him out!

466
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:03,160
Any way you can stop it?
Not from down here.

467
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,000
But now we know how he's doing it...
We can fight back! Oh, yes!

468
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,120
Three TARDIS keys, with low-level
perception properties, because the
TARDIS is designed to blend in.

469
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,880
Well, sort of,
but now, the Archangel Network's
got a second low-level signal.

470
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,600
Weld the key to the network and...
Martha, look at me.
You can see me, yes? Yep!

471
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,080
What about now?

472
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,080
JACK LAUGHS

473
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,160
No, I'm here, look at me.

474
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,960
It's like... I know you're there,
but I don't want to know.

475
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,720
Back again! See? It just shifts
your perception a tiny bit.

476
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,440
Doesn't make us invisible,
just unnoticed.

477
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,080
Oh! I know what it's like!
It's like...

478
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,640
It's like when you fancy someone and
they don't even know you exist.

479
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,120
That's what it's like.

480
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Come on!

481
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,440
You too, huh?

482
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,280
Don't run.

483
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,920
Don't shout.
just keep your voice down.

484
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,000
Draw attention to yourself
and the spell is broken.

485
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,320
just keep to the shadows.

486
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:32,320
Like ghosts.
Yeah. That's what we are.

487
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,840
Ghosts.

488
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,160
And as the eyes of the world
turn towards Great Britain,

489
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,920
sources indicate that Air Force One
has landed on British soil tonight.

490
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,880
Mr President, sir!

491
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,000
Mr Saxon,
the British Army will stand down.

492
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,680
From now on, UNIT has
control of this operation.

493
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,040
You make it sound like an invasion.

494
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,200
The First Contact Policy was decided
by the Security Council in 1968
and you've just ignored it!

495
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:30,400
Well, you know what it's like -
new job, all that paperwork.

496
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:33,560
I think it's down the back of
the settee. I had a quick look.

497
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,600
I found a pen, a sweet, a bus ticket
and, er... Have you met the wife?

498
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,560
I'm not sure what your game is,
but there are provisions at the UN
to have you removed from office

499
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,000
unless you are very, very careful!
Is that understood?

500
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,200
Are you taking this seriously?

501
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:57,360
To business. We've accessed
your files on these... Toclafane.

502
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:01,040
But First Contact cannot take place
on any sovereign soil.

503
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:04,680
To that purpose, Aircraft
Carrier Valiant is en route.

504
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:07,320
The rendezvous will
take place there, at 8am.

505
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,360
HE MUMBLES

506
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,240
You're trying my patience, sir!

507
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,400
So America is completely in charge?

508
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:20,520
Since Britain elected an ass, yes!
See you on board the Valiant!

509
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,760
It still will be televised, though,
won't it? Because I promised.

510
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,480
And the whole world is watching.

511
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,960
Since it's too late to pull out,
the world will be watching...

512
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,480
Me!

513
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:40,440
The last President of America.

514
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,960
We have a private plane
ready and waiting.

515
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,840
We should reach the Valiant
within the hour.

516
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,320
My darling...

517
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,520
SIREN BLARES

518
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:24,480
THE MASTER LAUGHS
Hi, guys!

519
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:30,000
SHOUTING
All... All will be revealed!

520
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,120
Oh, my God! Don't move.

521
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,640
But the... Don't!

522
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:37,120
I'm gonna kill him!

523
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,400
What say I use this perception
filter to walk up behind him
and break his neck?

524
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,520
Now that sounds like Torchwood.

525
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,520
Still a good plan.

526
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,480
He's a Time Lord.

527
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:54,000
Which makes him my responsibility.
I'm not here to kill him.

528
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,080
I'm here to save him.

529
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,320
Aircraft Carrier Valiant.

530
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,520
That's a UNIT ship,
at 58.2 North, 10.02 East.

531
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,360
How do we get on board?
Does that thing work as a teleport?

532
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,960
Since you revamped it, yeah.

533
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,560
Co-ordinates set.

534
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,840
CRIES OF PAIN

535
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,720
That thing is rough! Oh,
I've had worse nights! Agh!

536
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Welcome to the Valiant.

537
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,400
It's dawn...

538
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,880
Hold on, I thought this was
a ship. Where's the sea?!
A ship for the 21st century.

539
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,240
Protecting the
skies of Planet Earth!

540
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,880
ON TANNOY: Europe now online.

541
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,400
Awaiting confirmation from South
America. Keep tracking Japan.

542
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,320
I want the whole thing branded
with my Seal of Office,
not the UN, you got that?

543
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:11,280
Anything I can do? I could make tea?
Or isn't that American enough?

544
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:14,320
I don't know, I could make grits!
What are grits, anyway?

545
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,880
If you could just sit.

546
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,760
Misery guts!

547
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,280
What d'you think?
It's good, isn't it?

548
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,800
It's beautiful.
Some of my best work.

549
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,600
(Ministry of Defence.)

550
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,760
I helped design this place.

551
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,080
Every detail.

552
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:46,440
We don't have time for sight-seeing!
No, no, wait, shhh.

553
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,800
Can't you hear it? Hear what?

554
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:51,600
Doctor, my family's on board.
Brilliant!

555
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,720
This way!

556
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,000
Oh, at last! Oh, yes!
What's it doing on the Valiant?

557
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,280
What the hell has he done?
Don't touch it! Not going to!

558
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,040
What's he done, though?

559
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,560
Sounds like it's... sick.
It can't be.

560
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,840
No, no, no, no, no, no,
it can't be. Doctor, what is it?

561
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:32,120
He's cannibalised the TARDIS.
Is this what I think it is?

562
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,960
It's a Paradox Machine.

563
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,280
Two minutes, everyone.

564
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:44,120
According to the treaty, all armed
personnel are requested to leave the
Flight Deck immediately, thank you.

565
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,760
jelly baby?
Broadcasting at 7.58,

566
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,000
with the arrival
timed for 0800 hours exactly.

567
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,320
And good luck to all of us.

568
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,000
Soon as this hits red,
it activates.

569
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,800
At this speed, it'll trigger
at two minutes past eight.

570
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:07,360
First contact is at eight, then
two minutes later. What's it for?

571
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,840
What does a Paradox Machine do?
Can you stop it?

572
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,720
Not till I know what it's doing...
touch the wrong bit,
blow up the solar system.

573
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,760
Then we've gotta get to the Master!
How we gonna stop him?

574
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,160
Oh, I've got a way.
Sorry, didn't I mention it?

575
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,440
And in just 30 seconds' time, we'll
be going live to First Contact.

576
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:31,120
It's been announced that
Harold Saxon has invited President
Winters to take the address.

577
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,040
It's 3am in the morning
on the Eastern Seaboard,

578
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:40,000
and President Winters
has been chosen to lead
the world into a new age.

579
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:44,040
My fellow Americans, patriots,
people of the world.

580
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,880
I stand before you today
as ambassador for humanity.

581
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,400
A role I will undertake
with the utmost solemnity.

582
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,880
Perhaps our Toclafane cousins
can offer us much,

583
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,280
but what is important is not
that we gain material benefits,

584
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,280
but that we learn
to see ourselves anew.

585
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:07,840
For as long as man has looked
to the stars, he has wondered
what mysteries they hold.

586
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:11,120
Now we know we are not alone.
(This plan, you gonna tell us?)

587
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:14,280
If I can get this
around the Master's neck,

588
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,600
cancel out his perception,
they'll see him for real.

589
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:22,000
It’s just hard to go unnoticed
when everyone is on red alert.

590
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:26,360
If they stop me, you've got a key.
Yes, sir. I'll get him.

591
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,920
And I ask you now,
I ask of the Human Race,

592
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:33,480
to join with me
in welcoming our friends.

593
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,200
I give you the Toclafane.

594
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:48,080
My name is Arthur Coleman Winters,
President Elect of the
United States of America

595
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,120
and Designated Representative
of the United Nations.

596
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:55,120
I welcome you to the Planet Earth
and its associated Moon.

597
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,840
You're not the Master.
We like the Mr Master.

598
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,400
We don't like you.

599
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,360
I can be master, if you so wish.

600
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,080
I will accept mastery over you,
if that is God's will.

601
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,880
Man is stupid.

602
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,880
Master is our friend.

603
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,600
Where's my Master, pretty please?

604
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:20,120
Ohh, all right, then.
It's me! Ta-daa!

605
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
Ha-ha! Sorry!

606
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,800
Sorry, I have this effect, people
just get obsessed! Is it the smile?

607
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:31,120
Is it the aftershave? Is it
the capacity to laugh at myself?
I don't know! It's crazy!

608
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,840
Saxon, what are you talking about?

609
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:39,120
I'm taking control, Uncle Sam,
starting with you.

610
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,840
Kill him!

611
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,400
HE LAUGHS

612
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,400
Guards!
Nobody move! Nobody move!

613
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:58,960
Now then! Peoples of the Earth,
please attend carefully.

614
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,680
Stop him!

615
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,560
We meet at last, Doctor.
O- ho... I love saying that!

616
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:11,440
Stop this, stop it now!
As if a perception filter's
gonna work on me!

617
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,320
And look, it's the girlie
and the freak, although
I'm not sure which one's which.

618
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,960
Laser screwdriver, who'd have sonic?

619
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,320
The good thing is, he's not dead
for long, I get to kill him again!

620
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:33,000
Master, just calm down, just look
at what you're doing, just stop...
If you could see yourself.

621
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:37,080
Do excuse me, little bit
of personal business,
back in a minute. Let him go.

622
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,200
It's that sound, the sound in
your head, what if I can help?

623
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,960
Oh! How to shut him up?

624
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,680
I know! Memory Lane!

625
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:53,400
Professor Lazarus, remember him,
and his Genetic Manipulation Device?

626
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,360
Did you think little "Tish"
got that job by coincidence?

627
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,600
I've been laying traps for you all
this time, and if I can concentrate

628
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:08,120
all that Lazarus technology
into one little screwdriver...

629
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,400
...but, ooh, if only I had
the Doctor's biological code...

630
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,520
Oh, wait a minute, I do!

631
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,760
I've got his hand!

632
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:24,720
And if Lazarus made himself younger,
what if I reverse it?

633
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,600
Another 100 years?

634
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:32,480
DOCTOR CRIES AND GASPS

635
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:37,160
Teleport. I can't!

636
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:40,840
We can't stop him.
Get out of here.

637
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,080
Get out!

638
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Doctor, I've got you.

639
00:40:57,120 --> 00:41:00,040
Ah, she's a would be doctor.

640
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,960
But tonight, Martha Jones,

641
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,560
we've flown 'em in,
all the way from prison...

642
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,160
Mum! I'm sorry.

643
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:20,400
THE DOCTOR PANTS
The Toclafane...

644
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,920
What are they? Who are they?

645
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:26,960
Doctor, if I told you the truth...

646
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,720
your hearts would break.

647
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,240
Is it time? Is it ready?

648
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,720
Is the machine singing?

649
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,720
Two minutes past!

650
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,800
So, earthlings...

651
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,640
Basically, um...

652
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,600
...end of the world!

653
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,640
Here... come... the drums!

654
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,760
MUSIC: "Voodoo Child"
by Rogue Traders

655
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,040
How many d'you think?
I... I don't know!

656
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,400
Six billion.

657
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,880
MUSIC STOPS
Down you go, kids!

658
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:04,160
Shall we decimate them?

659
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:07,720
That sounds good, nice word -
decimate.

660
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,040
Remove one tenth
of the population!

661
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,600
SCREAMING

662
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:22,880
'This is Geneva! We're getting
slaughtered down here!

663
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,360
'Help us! Help us! '

664
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,720
'This is London! This is London
calling! What do we do?!

665
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,040
'They're killing us!
The Toclafane are killing us! '

666
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:17,400
EXPLOSIONS AND SCREAMING

667
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,960
I'm coming back.

668
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:31,240
And so it came to pass
that the Human Race fell,

669
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,600
and the Earth was no more.

670
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:41,280
And I looked down upon my new
dominion, as Master of all,

671
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:45,000
and I thought it good.

672
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,000
Subtitles Ripped by
Mighty_Marvel

673
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,160
Ever since I was a child,
I looked into the Vortex.

674
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,080
That's when it chose me.

675
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:52,080
The drumming, the call to war.

676
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,600
Can't you hear it?
