1
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:10,842  X1:078 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
ROSE:
So what is it? What's wrong?

2
00:00:10,882 --> 00:00:14,438  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know. Some kind of signal,
drawing the Tardis off course.

3
00:00:14,478 --> 00:00:17,835  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where are we?
Earth. Utah, North America.

4
00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:21,272  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
About half a mile underground.
And. . .when are we?

5
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:24,473  X1:318 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
2012.

6
00:00:24,513 --> 00:00:27,499  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
God, that's so close.
I should be 26!

7
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:37,095  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Blimey. Like a great big museum.

8
00:00:37,135 --> 00:00:39,222  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
An alien museum.

9
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:43,488  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Someone's got a hobby -

10
00:00:43,528 --> 00:00:45,769  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
they must've spent
a fortune on this.

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,205  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Chunks of meteorite. Moondust.

12
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:51,608  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the mileometer
from the Roswell spaceship.

13
00:00:51,647 --> 00:00:54,352  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's a bit of Slitheen!
That's a Slitheen's arm -

14
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:57,114  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
it's been stuffed!

15
00:00:57,154 --> 00:00:59,696  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah, look at you!

16
00:01:09,138 --> 00:01:10,856  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
What is it?

17
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:12,575  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
An old friend of mine.

18
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:14,812  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, enemy.

19
00:01:14,852 --> 00:01:18,050  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
The stuff of nightmares,
reduced to an exhibit.

20
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,768  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm getting old. Is that where
the signal's coming from?

21
00:01:21,808 --> 00:01:25,044  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nah, it's stone dead.
The signal's alive.

22
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,521  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Something's reaching out.

23
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:29,614  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Calling for help.

24
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:34,018  X1:078 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
ALARMS BUZZ AND BLEEP

25
00:01:43,423 --> 00:01:47,564  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
If someone's collecting aliens,
that makes you Exhibit A.

26
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:29,623  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:308 Y2:379
'Attention all personnel. Bad Wolf 1
descending, Bad Wolf 1 descending.'

27
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:40,881  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
On behalf of all of us, I wanna
wish you a very happy birthday, sir.

28
00:02:40,921 --> 00:02:46,277  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
The President conveys his personal 
best wishes.   The President is 10
points down. I want him replaced.

29
00:02:46,317 --> 00:02:51,312  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
I don't think that's wise, sir.
Thank you so much for your opinion.
You're fired. Get rid of him.

30
00:02:51,352 --> 00:02:56,303  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
Wipe his memory and put him
in Memphis, Minneapolis -
somewhere beginning with M.

31
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,780  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:416 Y2:523
So, the next President, what
d'you think? Republican or Democrat?
Democrat, sir. Why?

32
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,078  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're just so funny, sir?

33
00:03:04,575 --> 00:03:08,261  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
What is your name?
Goddard, sir. Diana Goddard.

34
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:10,768  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
I like you, Diana Goddard.

35
00:03:10,808 --> 00:03:13,409  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
So where's the English kid?
Sir, sir!

36
00:03:13,449 --> 00:03:17,126  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I bought ten more artefacts,
Mr Van Statten. Let me see 'em.

37
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:22,636  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:416 Y2:523
Sir, there's something more urgent.
We arrested two intruders 53 floors
down. We don't know how they got in.

38
00:03:22,676 --> 00:03:24,877  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll tell you. . .in-tru-da window!

39
00:03:24,917 --> 00:03:28,033  X1:078 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
In-tru-da window, that was funny!
THEY LAUGH OBEDIENTLY

40
00:03:28,073 --> 00:03:31,864  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Bring them in. And tell Simmons
I want to visit my little pet.

41
00:03:31,904 --> 00:03:35,461  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Simmons, you'd better give
me good news! Is it talking?

42
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:38,123  X1:078 X2:305 Y1:488 Y2:523
SIMMONS DRILLS

43
00:03:42,415 --> 00:03:44,493  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not exactly talking, no.

44
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:46,690  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then what's it doing? Screaming.

45
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:50,050  X1:078 X2:473 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is that any good?
DRILLING RESUMES

46
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:52,127  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
And this is the last.

47
00:03:52,167 --> 00:03:55,321  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Paid $800, 000 for it.
What does it do?

48
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:59,957  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Well, you see the tubes
on the side? Must be to channel
something, I think maybe fuel.

49
00:03:59,997 --> 00:04:02,435  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I really wouldn't hold it like that.
Shut it!

50
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,235  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Really though, that's wrong.

51
00:04:04,275 --> 00:04:07,909  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is it dangerous?
No, it just looks silly.

52
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:10,821  X1:078 X2:359 Y1:488 Y2:523
SOLDIERS COCK GUNS

53
00:04:17,219 --> 00:04:20,733  X1:078 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
You just need to be. . .
INSTRUMENT HUMS

54
00:04:20,773 --> 00:04:23,411  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .delicate.

55
00:04:23,451 --> 00:04:25,993  X1:078 X2:349 Y1:488 Y2:523
HUM CHANGES TONE

56
00:04:29,008 --> 00:04:30,771  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's a musical instrument.

57
00:04:32,882 --> 00:04:34,439  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
And it's a long way from home.

58
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,373  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here, let me.

59
00:04:37,359 --> 00:04:39,715  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
I did say delicate.

60
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:42,913  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
It reacts to the
smallest fingerprint.

61
00:04:42,953 --> 00:04:44,549  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
It needs precision.

62
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:46,961  X1:078 X2:337 Y1:488 Y2:523
INSTRUMENT HUMS

63
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:51,821  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Very good. Quite the expert.

64
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:53,664  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
As are you.

65
00:04:54,338 --> 00:04:56,351  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who exactly are you?

66
00:04:57,256 --> 00:05:00,213  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm the Doctor. And who are you?
Like you don't know(!)

67
00:05:00,253 --> 00:05:02,930  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're hidden away
with the most valuable collection

68
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,886  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
of extraterrestrial artefacts
in the world,

69
00:05:05,926 --> 00:05:08,564  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
and you just stumbled in
by mistake(? )

70
00:05:08,604 --> 00:05:12,241  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Pretty much sums me up, yeah.
Question is, how did you get in?

71
00:05:12,281 --> 00:05:15,758  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
53 floors down, with your
little cat-burglar accomplice.

72
00:05:15,798 --> 00:05:18,514  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Quite a collector yourself -
she's rather pretty.

73
00:05:18,554 --> 00:05:23,106  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
She's gonna smack you
if you keep calling her "she".
She's English, too!

74
00:05:23,146 --> 00:05:28,062  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
Hey, Little Lord Fauntleroy,
got you a girlfriend.
This is Mr Henry van Statten.

75
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:31,300  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
And who's he when he's at home?
Mr Van Statten owns the internet.

76
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,374  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Don't be stupid. No-one owns the
internet. Let's just keep the world
thinking that, right, kids?

77
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:39,971  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
So you're an expert in everything,
except the things in your museum.

78
00:05:40,011 --> 00:05:44,205  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
What you don't understand, you lock
up. You claim greater knowledge?
I don't claim.

79
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:48,121  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
I know how good I am. Yet I
captured you right next to the Cage.

80
00:05:48,161 --> 00:05:49,759  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
What were you doing down there?

81
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:53,319  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
You tell me. The Cage contains
my one living specimen.

82
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:56,316  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's that? Like you don't know.
Show me. You wanna see it?

83
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,953  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Blimey, you can smell
the testosterone.

84
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:01,987  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
Goddard!
Inform the Cage we're heading down.

85
00:06:02,027 --> 00:06:03,865  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
You, English, look after the girl.

86
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,658  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Go and canoodle or spoon
or whatever it is you British do.

87
00:06:07,698 --> 00:06:10,218  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
And you, Doctor with no name.

88
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:12,550  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come and see my pet!

89
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:17,050  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've tried everything.

90
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:22,923  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:416 Y2:523
The creature has shielded
itself, but there's
definite signs of life inside.

91
00:06:22,963 --> 00:06:25,684  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Inside? Inside what?
Welcome back, sir!

92
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:30,277  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've had to take the power down -
the Metaltron is resting. Metaltron?

93
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:32,675  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thought of it myself. Good, isn't it?

94
00:06:32,715 --> 00:06:35,432  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Although I'd much prefer
to find out its real name.

95
00:06:35,472 --> 00:06:37,152  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here, you'd better put these on.

96
00:06:37,192 --> 00:06:39,066  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
The last guy that touched it. . .

97
00:06:39,106 --> 00:06:41,343  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
burst into flames.

98
00:06:41,383 --> 00:06:43,231  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
I won't touch it, then.

99
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:46,099  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go ahead, Doctor.

100
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:47,782  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Impress me.

101
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:01,159  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't open that door
until we get a result.

102
00:07:09,556 --> 00:07:12,912  X1:078 X2:255 Y1:488 Y2:523
DOOR SLAMS

103
00:07:15,147 --> 00:07:18,784  X1:078 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look, I'm sorry about this, Mr Van
Statten might think he's clever,

104
00:07:18,824 --> 00:07:23,338  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
but never mind him.
I've come to help. I'm the Doctor.

105
00:07:23,378 --> 00:07:26,934  X1:126 X2:439 Y1:452 Y2:523
MECHANICAL  VOICE:
Doc. . .tor. . .

106
00:07:26,974 --> 00:07:28,773  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Impossible!

107
00:07:28,813 --> 00:07:32,869  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
THE Doctor?

108
00:07:34,409 --> 00:07:38,004  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Exterminate! Exterminate!

109
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:40,603  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:452 Y2:523
Let me out!
EXTERMINATE!

110
00:07:40,643 --> 00:07:43,241  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sir, it's going to kill him!
It's talking!

111
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:46,594  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are an enemy of the Daleks.

112
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:49,961  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
You must be destroyed!

113
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:56,673  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not working.

114
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,614  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fantastic!

115
00:08:04,654 --> 00:08:07,894  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, fantastic!

116
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,330  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
Powerless. Look at you.

117
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:14,045  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
The great space dustbin.
How does it feel?

118
00:08:14,085 --> 00:08:16,605  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Keep back! What for?

119
00:08:16,645 --> 00:08:19,233  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you gonna do to me?

120
00:08:22,477 --> 00:08:25,555  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
If you can't kill,

121
00:08:25,595 --> 00:08:28,225  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
then what are you good for, Dalek?

122
00:08:28,265 --> 00:08:31,058  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's the point of you?

123
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:34,781  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're nothing.

124
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:37,141  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell are you here for?

125
00:08:37,181 --> 00:08:41,055  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am. . .waiting for orders.

126
00:08:41,095 --> 00:08:44,216  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
What does that mean?
I am a soldier.

127
00:08:44,256 --> 00:08:47,092  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was bred to receive orders.

128
00:08:47,132 --> 00:08:49,649  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, you're never gonna get any.
Not ever.

129
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:51,886  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
I demand orders!

130
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:55,243  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're never gonna come.
Your race is dead. You all burnt.

131
00:08:55,283 --> 00:08:57,400  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
All of you.
Ten million ships on fire.

132
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,037  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
The  entire Dalek race wiped out,
in one second.

133
00:09:01,077 --> 00:09:02,515  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
You lie!

134
00:09:02,555 --> 00:09:04,828  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
I watched it happen.
I made it happen.

135
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:07,490  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
You destroyed us?

136
00:09:08,988 --> 00:09:12,014  X1:102 X2:297 Y1:488 Y2:523
MUSIC SWELLS

137
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:19,497  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I had no choice.

138
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:23,797  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
And what of the Time Lords?

139
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:29,684  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dead.

140
00:09:29,724 --> 00:09:31,642  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
They burnt with you.

141
00:09:31,682 --> 00:09:34,019  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
The end of the last great Time War.

142
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:38,316  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everyone lost.

143
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:42,629  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
And the coward survived.

144
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,305  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, and I caught
your little signal.

145
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:48,808  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
"Help me." Poor little thing.

146
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:55,652  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
But there's no-one else coming
cos there's no-one else left.

147
00:09:55,696 --> 00:10:01,729  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am alone in the universe.

148
00:10:01,769 --> 00:10:03,253  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yep.

149
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:08,577  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:488 Y2:523
So are you.

150
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:12,679  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
We are the same.

151
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:15,596  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're not the same! I'm not. . .

152
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:18,258  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, wait.

153
00:10:19,153 --> 00:10:21,187  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Maybe we are.

154
00:10:21,227 --> 00:10:24,865  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're right! Yeah, OK!
You've got a point.

155
00:10:24,905 --> 00:10:26,662  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cos I know what to do.

156
00:10:26,702 --> 00:10:29,020  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know what should happen.

157
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,318  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know what you deserve.

158
00:10:33,897 --> 00:10:35,660  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Exterminate.

159
00:10:37,571 --> 00:10:40,930  X1:078 X2:429 Y1:452 Y2:523
DALEK SCREAMS
Have pity!

160
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:43,808  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why should I? You never did!

161
00:10:43,848 --> 00:10:46,324  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get him out!

162
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:48,292  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Help me!

163
00:10:48,881 --> 00:10:52,956  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I saved your life. Now talk
to me. Godammit, talk to me!

164
00:10:52,996 --> 00:10:55,035  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've got to destroy it!

165
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:57,629  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
The last in the universe.

166
00:10:57,669 --> 00:11:00,107  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
And now I know your name.

167
00:11:00,147 --> 00:11:02,464  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Da-lek.

168
00:11:02,504 --> 00:11:04,582  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Speak to me, Dalek!

169
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:09,007  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
I am Henry van Statten -
now recognise me!

170
00:11:13,295 --> 00:11:15,812  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Make it talk again, Simmons.

171
00:11:15,852 --> 00:11:18,235  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Whatever it takes.

172
00:11:20,526 --> 00:11:22,923  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry about the mess.

173
00:11:22,963 --> 00:11:25,923  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Van Statten sort of
lets me do my own thing,

174
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:28,560  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
so long as I deliver the goods.

175
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,836  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you think that is?

176
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:38,624  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
A lump of metal? Yeah.

177
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:44,103  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
Yeah, but I think. . .
Well, I'm almost certain,
it's from the hull of a spacecraft.

178
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:49,534  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
The thing is, it's all true,
everything the United Nations
tries to keep quiet.

179
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:52,613  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Spacecraft,
aliens, visitors to Earth.

180
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:54,770  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
They really exist.

181
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:57,407  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's amazing.
I know it sounds incredible.

182
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:01,004  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
But I honestly believe the whole
universe is just teeming with life.

183
00:12:01,044 --> 00:12:02,813  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm gobsmacked, yeah.

184
00:12:04,321 --> 00:12:08,876  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
And you do what? Sit here and
catalogue it? Best job in the world!

185
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,990  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Imagine if you could get out there.

186
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,869  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Travel amongst the stars
and see it for real.

187
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:17,267  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah. I'd give anything. I don't
think it's ever gonna happen.

188
00:12:17,307 --> 00:12:19,744  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Not in our lifetimes.
Oh, you never know.

189
00:12:19,784 --> 00:12:25,975  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
What about all those people who say
they've been inside of spaceships
and things, and talked to aliens?

190
00:12:26,015 --> 00:12:29,866  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think they're nutters.
Yeah. Me too.

191
00:12:32,129 --> 00:12:33,848  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
So how d'you end up here?

192
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:39,083  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
Van Statten has agents all over,
looking for geniuses to recruit.
Oh, right, you're a genius.

193
00:12:39,123 --> 00:12:42,840  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sorry, but. . .yeah.
I can't help it - I was born clever.

194
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,591  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
When I was eight,
I logged onto the US defence system.

195
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:49,871  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nearly caused World War Three.
What, and that's funny, is it?

196
00:12:49,911 --> 00:12:53,716  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
You should've been there. Just to
see them running about. Fantastic!

197
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:56,781  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
You sound like the Doctor.

198
00:12:56,821 --> 00:13:00,460  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are you and him. . . ?
No, we're just friends. Good.

199
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,420  X1:244 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why's that good?

200
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,162  X1:310 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just is.

201
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:10,330  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, wouldn't you rather
be downstairs?

202
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,967  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've got these
bits of metal and stuff,

203
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:16,204  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
but Mr Van Statten's got
a living creature down there.

204
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:19,361  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah. Well, I did ask,
but he keeps it to himself.

205
00:13:19,401 --> 00:13:21,598  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Although. . . If you're a genius,

206
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:24,832  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
it doesn't take long to patch
through on the comms system.

207
00:13:24,872 --> 00:13:26,515  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let's have a look then!

208
00:13:28,947 --> 00:13:32,107  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
It doesn't do much, the alien.

209
00:13:32,147 --> 00:13:34,184  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's weird, it's kind of. . .useless.

210
00:13:34,224 --> 00:13:38,484  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's just like
this great big pepperpot.

211
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:47,649  X1:078 X2:243 Y1:488 Y2:523
MAN DRILLS

212
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:52,005  X1:078 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
DALEK SCREAMS
It's being tortured.
Where's the Doctor? I don't know.

213
00:13:52,045 --> 00:13:54,683  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Take me down there. Now.

214
00:13:54,723 --> 00:13:58,437  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
The metal's just battle armour.
The real Dalek creature is inside.

215
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:02,750  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
What does it look like?
It's a mutation.
They were genetically engineered.

216
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,308  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Every single emotion was removed,
except hate.

217
00:14:05,348 --> 00:14:08,624  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Genetically engineered? By whom?
By a genius, van Statten.

218
00:14:08,664 --> 00:14:12,262  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
By a man who was king of his own
little world. You'd like him.

219
00:14:12,302 --> 00:14:15,503  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's been on Earth for over 50
years. Sold at private auction,

220
00:14:15,543 --> 00:14:18,777  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
moving between collections.
Why would it be a threat now?

221
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,213  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Because I'm here.
How did it get to Earth?

222
00:14:21,253 --> 00:14:26,250  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
The records say it came from the sky
like a meteorite. It fell to Earth
on the Ascension Islands,

223
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,763  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
burnt in its crater for three days
before anybody could get near it.

224
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:33,321  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
And all that time, it was screaming.
Must have gone insane.

225
00:14:33,361 --> 00:14:35,518  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
It must have fallen through time.

226
00:14:35,558 --> 00:14:38,112  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
The only survivor.
You talked about a war?

227
00:14:38,152 --> 00:14:41,948  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Time War. The final battle
between my people and the Daleks.

228
00:14:41,988 --> 00:14:45,227  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
But  you survived too.
Not by choice.

229
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:49,184  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
This means the Dalek isn't
the only alien on Earth, Doctor.

230
00:14:49,224 --> 00:14:53,939  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's you. The only one
of your kind in existence.

231
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:05,040  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now. . .smile!

232
00:15:08,762 --> 00:15:12,800  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Two hearts.
A binary vascular system!

233
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,313  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, I am so gonna patent this.
So that's your secret.

234
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:18,670  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't just collect stuff,
you scavenge it.

235
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,387  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
This technology has been
falling to Earth for centuries.

236
00:15:22,427 --> 00:15:25,993  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
All it took was the right mind
to use it properly.

237
00:15:26,742 --> 00:15:30,019  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, the advances
I've made from alien junk -

238
00:15:30,059 --> 00:15:33,976  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
you have no idea, Doctor!
Broadband? Roswell.

239
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:37,173  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just last year, my scientists
cultivated bacteria

240
00:15:37,213 --> 00:15:40,530  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
from the Russian Crater,
and do you know what we found?

241
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:44,341  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
The cure for the common cold.

242
00:15:45,764 --> 00:15:49,758  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
Kept it within the laboratory,
of course.
No need to get people excited.

243
00:15:49,798 --> 00:15:53,115  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why sell one cure when I can sell
a thousand palliatives?

244
00:15:53,155 --> 00:15:56,187  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
D'you know what a Dalek is,
van Statten?

245
00:15:56,992 --> 00:15:58,706  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
A Dalek is honest.

246
00:15:58,746 --> 00:16:01,947  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
It does what it was born to do,
for the survival of its species.

247
00:16:01,987 --> 00:16:07,219  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
That creature in your dungeon
is better than you. In that case,
I will be true to myself.

248
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:09,017  X1:266 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
And continue.

249
00:16:09,057 --> 00:16:13,294  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Listen to me! That thing downstairs
is gonna kill every last one of us!

250
00:16:13,334 --> 00:16:15,216  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nothing can escape the Cage.

251
00:16:17,649 --> 00:16:21,326  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
But it's woken up! It knows
I'm here! It's gonna get out!

252
00:16:21,366 --> 00:16:24,922  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
Van Statten, I swear,
no-one on this base is safe.

253
00:16:24,962 --> 00:16:26,435  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
No-one on this planet!

254
00:16:27,719 --> 00:16:29,393  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
A-Aah!

255
00:16:29,433 --> 00:16:33,944  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
Hold it right there.
Level three access. Special
clearance from Mr Van Statten.

256
00:16:37,347 --> 00:16:40,134  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't get too close.

257
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:53,217  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hello?

258
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,126  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you in pain?

259
00:16:57,166 --> 00:17:00,484  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
My name's Rose Tyler. My friend
can help. He's called the Doctor.

260
00:17:00,524 --> 00:17:02,324  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's your name?

261
00:17:02,364 --> 00:17:04,321  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes.

262
00:17:04,361 --> 00:17:07,038  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

263
00:17:07,078 --> 00:17:11,749  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am in pain.

264
00:17:11,789 --> 00:17:15,707  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
They torture me,

265
00:17:15,747 --> 00:17:19,980  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
but still they fear me.

266
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:23,697  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you fear me?

267
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:25,506  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
No.

268
00:17:29,255 --> 00:17:33,207  X1:282 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
I  am dying.

269
00:17:33,247 --> 00:17:35,405  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, we can help. . . !

270
00:17:35,445 --> 00:17:39,521  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
I welcome death.

271
00:17:39,561 --> 00:17:42,918  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
But I am glad

272
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:47,951  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
that before I die,

273
00:17:47,991 --> 00:17:51,868  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
I met a human

274
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:55,462  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
who was not afraid.

275
00:17:55,502 --> 00:17:58,702  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Isn't there anything I can do?

276
00:17:58,742 --> 00:18:01,694  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
My race is dead.

277
00:18:03,138 --> 00:18:06,983  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
I shall die alone.

278
00:18:15,324 --> 00:18:16,962  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose, no!

279
00:18:17,961 --> 00:18:23,115  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Genetic material extrapolated.

280
00:18:23,155 --> 00:18:29,133  X1:220 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
Initiate cellular reconstruction!

281
00:18:34,022 --> 00:18:36,399  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell have you done?

282
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:42,254  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
What ya gonna do?
Sucker me to death?

283
00:18:42,294 --> 00:18:45,651  X1:078 X2:315 Y1:488 Y2:523
MUFFLED SCREAM

284
00:18:45,691 --> 00:18:48,768  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's killing him! Do something!
Condition red.

285
00:18:48,808 --> 00:18:51,605  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Repeat, this is not a drill!'

286
00:18:51,645 --> 00:18:54,756  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Release me if you want to live.

287
00:18:56,282 --> 00:18:59,472  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've got to keep it in that cell!
Doctor, it's all my fault.

288
00:18:59,512 --> 00:19:03,030  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've sealed the compartment. The
lock's got a billion combinations.

289
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,706  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
A Dalek is a genius.
It can calculate a thousand billion
combinations in one second flat.

290
00:19:27,606 --> 00:19:30,163  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Open fire!

291
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:32,641  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't shoot it - I want it unharmed!

292
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:36,372  X1:078 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, get out of there!
GUNSHOTS

293
00:19:42,112 --> 00:19:46,026  X1:078 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
De Maggio, get the civilians out
alive. That is your job, got that?

294
00:19:46,066 --> 00:19:47,709  X1:258 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
You! With me!

295
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:59,925  X1:078 X2:303 Y1:488 Y2:523
ELECTRICAL BUZZ

296
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:08,250  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Abandoning the Cage, sir!

297
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,795  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're losing power.
It's draining the base.

298
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:16,154  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my God. It's draining the entire
power supplies of the whole of Utah.

299
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:18,230  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's downloading. Downloading what?

300
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:20,507  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sir!
The entire West Coast has gone down!

301
00:20:20,547 --> 00:20:24,465  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's not just energy. That Dalek
just absorbed the entire internet.

302
00:20:24,505 --> 00:20:26,274  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
It knows everything!

303
00:20:27,662 --> 00:20:31,962  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Daleks survive in me!

304
00:20:40,767 --> 00:20:44,523  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
The cameras in the Vault are down.
We've only got emergency power.

305
00:20:44,563 --> 00:20:48,619  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Kill it now! All guards to converge
on the Metaltron Cage immediately.

306
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:52,570  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Civilians! Let 'em through!

307
00:20:56,348 --> 00:21:01,026  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cover the north wall. Reds,
maintain suppressing fire
along the perimeter. Blues. . .

308
00:21:01,066 --> 00:21:03,733  X1:078 X2:395 Y1:452 Y2:523
Agh!
GUNSHOTS

309
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,146  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gna-a-a-argh!

310
00:21:20,968 --> 00:21:22,890  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
A-Aah!

311
00:21:26,755 --> 00:21:28,894  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
A-A-A-Aah!

312
00:21:32,509 --> 00:21:35,467  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell them to stop shooting at it.
But it's killing them!

313
00:21:35,507 --> 00:21:38,024  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
They're dispensable -
that Dalek is unique.

314
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:42,540  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't want a scratch
on its bodywork! Do you hear me?

315
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,818  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you hear me?

316
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:47,070  X1:078 X2:335 Y1:488 Y2:523
GUNSHOTS DIE OUT

317
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:01,801  X1:078 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's us, right below the surface.

318
00:22:01,841 --> 00:22:04,038  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's the Cage,
and that's the Dalek.

319
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:08,632  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Have you got any alien weapons?
Lots of them, but the Dalek's
between us and them.

320
00:22:08,672 --> 00:22:13,629  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
We've got to keep it alive.
We could just seal the entire vault.
Leaving everyone trapped with it?

321
00:22:13,669 --> 00:22:16,785  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose is down there.
I won't let that happen, got that?

322
00:22:16,825 --> 00:22:19,903  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
It has to go through this area.
What's that? Weapons testing.

323
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:25,921  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Give guns to technicians, lawyers -
anyone, everyone. Only then
have you got a chance of killing it.

324
00:22:26,654 --> 00:22:29,851  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Stairs! That's more like it!
Hasn't got legs - it's stuck!

325
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:31,660  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's coming! Get up!

326
00:22:46,513 --> 00:22:49,310  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Great big alien death machine.

327
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:52,424  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Defeated by a flight of stairs!

328
00:22:52,464 --> 00:22:56,660  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now listen to me. I demand
that you return to your Cage.

329
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,538  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you want to negotiate, Mr Van
Statten will be willing to talk.

330
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:04,055  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I accept that we imprisoned you,
and maybe that was wrong,

331
00:23:04,095 --> 00:23:08,089  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
but people have died,
and that stops - right now.

332
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:10,609  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
The killing stops.
Have you got that?

333
00:23:10,649 --> 00:23:13,191  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
I demand that you surrender.
Is that clear?

334
00:23:14,367 --> 00:23:17,109  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
El-ev-ate.

335
00:23:23,114 --> 00:23:24,718  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God.

336
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:33,242  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Adam, get her out of here.

337
00:23:34,182 --> 00:23:36,019  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come with us. You can't stop it.

338
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,257  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Someone's got to try. Now get out!

339
00:23:38,297 --> 00:23:40,509  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't look back, just run!

340
00:23:47,528 --> 00:23:50,440  X1:078 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
WOMAN SCREAMS LOUDLY

341
00:23:52,605 --> 00:23:55,079  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought you were
the great expert, Doctor.

342
00:23:55,119 --> 00:23:58,433  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you're so impressive,
why not just reason with this Dalek?

343
00:23:58,473 --> 00:24:01,633  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
It must be willing to negotiate.
It must need something.

344
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:06,466  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
Everything does. What's the nearest
town? Salt Lake City. Population?
One million. All dead.

345
00:24:06,506 --> 00:24:10,224  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
If the Dalek gets out, it'll murder
every creature. That's all it needs.

346
00:24:10,264 --> 00:24:15,418  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
But why? ! It honestly believes
they should die. Human beings are
different, and different is wrong.

347
00:24:15,458 --> 00:24:19,673  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's the ultimate in racial
cleansing, and you, Van Statten,
let it loose.

348
00:24:29,323 --> 00:24:32,916  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Dalek's got a force field.
The bullets melt before they hit.

349
00:24:32,956 --> 00:24:38,036  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
But it's not indestructible!
If you concentrate your fire,
you might get through.

350
00:24:41,667 --> 00:24:44,946  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Aim for the dome - the head,
the eyepiece. That's the weak spot.

351
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:48,803  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thank you, Doctor, but I think I know
how to fight one single tin robot.

352
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:53,622  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Positions!

353
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:04,327  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hold your fire!

354
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:06,545  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
You two, get the hell out of there!

355
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:33,814  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
It was looking at me.
Yeah, it wants to slaughter us!

356
00:25:33,854 --> 00:25:35,572  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, but it was looking right at me!

357
00:25:35,612 --> 00:25:39,609  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
So? It's just a sort of metal eye
thing, it's looking all around.

358
00:25:39,649 --> 00:25:42,686  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know.
It's like there's something inside,

359
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:45,039  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
looking at me, like. . .

360
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:47,132  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like it knows me.

361
00:25:51,873 --> 00:25:54,376  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
On my mark.

362
00:25:59,188 --> 00:26:02,385  X1:078 X2:429 Y1:452 Y2:523
Open fire!
VOLLEY OF SHOTS

363
00:26:06,739 --> 00:26:08,457  X1:246 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've got vision!

364
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:15,540  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
It wants us to see.

365
00:27:07,234 --> 00:27:09,361  X1:078 X2:209 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREAMS

366
00:27:16,185 --> 00:27:18,437  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
Fall back! Fall back!

367
00:27:46,392 --> 00:27:51,665  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
Perhaps it's time for a new strategy.
Maybe we should consider
abandoning this place.

368
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:55,501  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Except there's no power to the
helipad, sir. We can't get out.

369
00:27:55,541 --> 00:28:00,857  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
You said we could seal the vault?
It was designed to be a bunker
in the event of nuclear war.

370
00:28:00,897 --> 00:28:04,294  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Steel bulkheads. . . Not enough power!
We've got emergency power,

371
00:28:04,334 --> 00:28:08,128  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
we can reroute that.
We'd need a computer genius
to bypass the security.

372
00:28:08,168 --> 00:28:13,045  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
Good  thing you've got me, then.
You want to help? I don't want
to die, Doctor. Simple as that.

373
00:28:13,085 --> 00:28:16,997  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
And nobody knows this software
better than me. Sir. . . ?

374
00:28:17,037 --> 00:28:23,220  X1:206 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
I shall speak only to the Doctor.

375
00:28:26,827 --> 00:28:29,105  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're gonna get rusty.

376
00:28:29,145 --> 00:28:34,899  X1:126 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
I fed off the DNA of Rose Tyler.

377
00:28:34,939 --> 00:28:40,653  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Extrapolating the biomass
of a time-traveller

378
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:44,449  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
regenerated me.
What's your next trick?

379
00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:49,088  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
I have been searching
for the Daleks.

380
00:28:49,128 --> 00:28:50,921  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah, I saw.

381
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:53,638  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Downloading the internet.
What did you find?

382
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:59,115  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
I scanned your satellites
and radio telescopes.

383
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:02,468  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:452 Y2:523
And?
Nothing.

384
00:29:02,508 --> 00:29:05,707  X1:126 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where shall I get my orders now?

385
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:07,903  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're just a soldier
without commands.

386
00:29:07,943 --> 00:29:12,259  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then I shall follow
the Primary Order.

387
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:16,257  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Dalek instinct to destroy.
To conquer!

388
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:18,350  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
What for? What's the point? !

389
00:29:20,812 --> 00:29:25,522  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
Don't you see? It's all gone.
Everything you were,
everything you stood for.

390
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:30,769  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then what should I do?

391
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:34,834  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
All right, then.

392
00:29:34,874 --> 00:29:37,621  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
If you want orders, follow this one.

393
00:29:39,434 --> 00:29:41,588  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Kill yourself.

394
00:29:41,628 --> 00:29:43,705  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Daleks must survive!

395
00:29:43,745 --> 00:29:45,345  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Daleks have failed!

396
00:29:45,385 --> 00:29:48,382  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why don't you finish the job
and make the Daleks extinct?

397
00:29:48,422 --> 00:29:51,783  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rid the universe of your filth!
Why don't you just DIE? !

398
00:29:54,135 --> 00:29:58,151  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
You would make a good Dalek.

399
00:30:04,601 --> 00:30:06,410  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Seal the vaults.

400
00:30:14,711 --> 00:30:18,510  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can leech power off the ground
defences, feed it to the bulkheads.

401
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:23,584  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's years since I had to work
this fast! Are you enjoying this?!
Doctor. She's still down there.

402
00:30:23,624 --> 00:30:26,060  X1:078 X2:367 Y1:488 Y2:523

403
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,580  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
This isn't the best time!

404
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,217  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
Where are you? Level 49.

405
00:30:31,257 --> 00:30:34,971  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've got to keep moving. The vault
is being sealed off up at level 46.

406
00:30:35,011 --> 00:30:37,811  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can't you stop them closing?
I'm closing them.

407
00:30:37,851 --> 00:30:41,781  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can't wait, and I can't help you.
Now for God's sake, run!

408
00:30:48,877 --> 00:30:52,471  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
Done it! Power to the bulkheads.
The Dalek's right behind them.

409
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:54,751  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're nearly there -
give us two seconds!

410
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:58,187  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor, I can't sustain the power.
The whole system is failing.

411
00:30:58,227 --> 00:31:00,769  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've got to close the bulkheads.

412
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:10,054  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

417
00:31:39,383 --> 00:31:42,790  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose! Where are you?
Rose, did you make it?

418
00:31:47,454 --> 00:31:49,672  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sorry. I was a bit slow.

419
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,418  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
See you, then, Doctor.

420
00:32:06,554 --> 00:32:08,390  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
It wasn't your fault.

421
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,908  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Remember that, OK?
It wasn't your fault.

422
00:32:10,948 --> 00:32:13,570  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
'And d'you know what?'

423
00:32:14,667 --> 00:32:18,558  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wouldn't have missed it
for the world.

424
00:32:26,813 --> 00:32:30,214  X1:102 X2:447 Y1:452 Y2:523
Exterminate!
ELECTRICAL PULSE

425
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:36,076  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
It killed her. I'm sorry.

426
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:41,834  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
I said I'd protect her. She was here
because of me, and you're sorry? !

427
00:32:41,874 --> 00:32:45,672  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
I could have killed that Dalek
in its cell, but you stopped me.

428
00:32:45,712 --> 00:32:50,346  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
It was the prize of my collection!
Your collection? !
Well, was it worth it?

429
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:53,386  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
Worth all those men's deaths?
Worth Rose?

430
00:32:53,426 --> 00:32:55,023  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let me tell you something.

431
00:32:55,063 --> 00:32:58,857  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mankind goes into space to explore.
To be part of something greater. . .

432
00:32:58,897 --> 00:33:01,977  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Exactly! I wanted to touch the stars.

433
00:33:02,017 --> 00:33:06,931  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
You just want to drag the stars
down and stick them underground
underneath tons of sand and dirt,

434
00:33:06,971 --> 00:33:08,605  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
and label them.

435
00:33:08,645 --> 00:33:11,517  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're about as far from the stars
as you can get.

436
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:18,042  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
And you took her down with you.

437
00:33:19,554 --> 00:33:21,567  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
She was 19 years old.

438
00:33:31,065 --> 00:33:33,488  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go on then, kill me.

439
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,618  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why are you doing this? !

440
00:33:37,658 --> 00:33:40,975  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am armed. I will kill.

441
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:43,813  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
It is my purpose.

442
00:33:43,853 --> 00:33:45,607  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're all dead because of you!

443
00:33:45,647 --> 00:33:49,498  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
They are dead because of US!

444
00:33:52,638 --> 00:33:54,198  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
And now what?

445
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:55,875  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you waiting for?

446
00:33:55,915 --> 00:34:00,511  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
I feel your fear.

447
00:34:00,551 --> 00:34:06,086  X1:172 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
What d'you expect?
Daleks do not fear. Must not fear!

448
00:34:08,783 --> 00:34:12,180  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
You gave me life.

449
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:16,537  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
What else have you given me?

450
00:34:16,577 --> 00:34:19,938  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am contaminated.

451
00:34:21,054 --> 00:34:23,725  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
You were quick on your feet,
leaving Rose behind.

452
00:34:23,765 --> 00:34:26,122  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm not the one who
sealed the vault!

453
00:34:26,162 --> 00:34:30,912  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:452 Y2:523
Open the bulkhead
or Rose Tyler dies.

454
00:34:33,316 --> 00:34:36,193  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're alive! Can't get rid of me.

455
00:34:36,233 --> 00:34:40,470  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought you were dead.
Open the bulkhead!

456
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,307  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't do it!
What use are emotions,

457
00:34:44,347 --> 00:34:50,655  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
if you will not save
the woman you love?

458
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:56,972  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
I killed her once.

459
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:59,190  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't do it again.

460
00:35:15,832 --> 00:35:19,626  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do we do now? You bleeding
heart, what the hell do we do?

461
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:22,066  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Kill it when it gets here.
The guns are useless,

462
00:35:22,106 --> 00:35:26,412  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
and the alien weapons are in the
vault. Only the catalogued ones.

463
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:31,300  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Broken.

464
00:35:32,336 --> 00:35:34,294  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Broken.

465
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:36,371  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hairdryer.

466
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:40,522  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Van Statten tends to dispose
of his staff and wipe their memory.

467
00:35:40,562 --> 00:35:44,478  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
I kept this in case I needed to
fight my way out. You, in a fight?

468
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:48,164  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
I could do! What you gonna do, throw
your A Levels at 'em? . .Oh, yes!

469
00:35:49,953 --> 00:35:52,660  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Lock and load!

470
00:36:00,664 --> 00:36:03,781  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm begging you, don't kill them.
You didn't kill me.

471
00:36:03,821 --> 00:36:07,616  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
But why not? Why are you alive?

472
00:36:07,656 --> 00:36:11,651  X1:180 X2:613 Y1:488 Y2:523
My function is to kill. What am I?

473
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:13,858  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
What am I? !

474
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:22,520  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't move! Don't do anything!

475
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,478  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's beginning to question itself.

476
00:36:24,518 --> 00:36:27,113  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Van Statten.

477
00:36:27,153 --> 00:36:31,152  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You tortured me. Why?

478
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:34,546  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wanted to help you, I just. . .
I don't know, I was trying to help.

479
00:36:34,586 --> 00:36:37,666  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought if we could get through
to you, could mend you. . .

480
00:36:37,706 --> 00:36:39,423  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wanted you better. I'm sorry.

481
00:36:39,463 --> 00:36:42,338  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm so sorry. I swear,
I just wanted you to talk!

482
00:36:42,378 --> 00:36:45,657  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then hear me talk now.

483
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:48,333  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Exterminate! Exterminate!

484
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,771  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
EXTERMINATE!

485
00:36:50,811 --> 00:36:55,885  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't do it! Don't kill him!
You don't have to do this any more.

486
00:36:55,925 --> 00:36:59,478  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
There must be something else, not
just killing. What else is there?

487
00:36:59,518 --> 00:37:01,935  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you want? !

488
00:37:06,912 --> 00:37:09,070  X1:298 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
I want. . .

489
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,698  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
freedom.

490
00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:52,621  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're out. You made it.

491
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:58,180  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
I never thought
I'd feel the sunlight again.

492
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:03,220  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
How does it. . .feel?

493
00:38:05,367 --> 00:38:07,835  X1:102 X2:245 Y1:488 Y2:523
IT WHIRRS

494
00:38:37,138 --> 00:38:40,050  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
Get out of the way!

495
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:47,124  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, get out of the way, now! No!
Cos I won't let you do this.

496
00:38:47,164 --> 00:38:49,323  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
That thing
killed hundreds of people.

497
00:38:49,363 --> 00:38:51,880  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's not the one
pointing the gun at me.

498
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:54,637  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got to do this.
I've got to end it.

499
00:38:54,677 --> 00:38:59,071  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Daleks destroyed my home,
my people. I've got nothing left.

500
00:38:59,111 --> 00:39:00,515  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at it.

501
00:39:02,788 --> 00:39:05,120  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's it doing?

502
00:39:06,106 --> 00:39:08,743  X1:238 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the sunlight.
That's all it wants.

503
00:39:08,783 --> 00:39:12,420  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
But it can't. . . It couldn't kill
van Statten, it couldn't kill me.

504
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:17,054  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's changing.
And what about you, Doctor?

505
00:39:17,094 --> 00:39:19,796  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
What the hell are you changing into?

506
00:39:24,124 --> 00:39:26,422  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
I couldn't. . .

507
00:39:29,838 --> 00:39:31,760  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wasn't. . .

508
00:39:36,752 --> 00:39:39,390  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, Rose.

509
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,067  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're all dead.

510
00:39:41,107 --> 00:39:46,343  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why do we survive?

511
00:39:46,383 --> 00:39:48,740  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know.

512
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:56,067  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am the last of the Daleks.

513
00:39:56,975 --> 00:39:59,806  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're not even that.

514
00:39:59,846 --> 00:40:02,203  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose did more than regenerate you.

515
00:40:02,243 --> 00:40:05,322  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've absorbed her DNA.

516
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:06,880  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're mutating.

517
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:10,516  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Into what?

518
00:40:10,556 --> 00:40:12,814  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Something new.

519
00:40:15,271 --> 00:40:17,068  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

520
00:40:17,108 --> 00:40:18,988  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Isn't that better?

521
00:40:19,028 --> 00:40:21,384  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not for a Dalek.

522
00:40:21,424 --> 00:40:26,063  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can. . .feel

523
00:40:26,103 --> 00:40:30,335  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
so many ideas.

524
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:34,450  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
So much darkness.

525
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:39,005  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose. Give me orders.

526
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:44,045  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Order me to die.

527
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,713  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't do that.

528
00:40:49,753 --> 00:40:53,112  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is not life.

529
00:40:53,152 --> 00:40:56,389  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is sickness.

530
00:40:56,429 --> 00:41:00,863  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
I shall not be like you!

531
00:41:00,903 --> 00:41:03,696  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Order my destruction!

532
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,420  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Obey!

533
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:09,036  X1:270 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Obey! Obey!

534
00:41:12,009 --> 00:41:13,692  X1:318 X2:401 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do it.

535
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:22,723  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you frightened, Rose Tyler?

536
00:41:24,837 --> 00:41:27,274  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

537
00:41:27,314 --> 00:41:30,391  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
So am I.

538
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:35,970  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Exterminate.

539
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:14,064  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:416 Y2:523
What the hell are you doing?
200 personnel dead,
and all because of you, sir.

540
00:42:14,104 --> 00:42:18,180  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Take him away, wipe his memory
and leave him by the road someplace.

541
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,818  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can't do this to me!
I am Henry van Statten!

542
00:42:20,858 --> 00:42:24,452  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
By tonight, Henry van Statten will
be a homeless, brainless junkie,

543
00:42:24,492 --> 00:42:28,168  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
living on the streets of
San Diego, Seattle, Sacramento -

544
00:42:28,208 --> 00:42:31,649  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
some place beginning with S.

545
00:42:34,843 --> 00:42:37,560  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Little piece of home.
Better than nothing.

546
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:41,953  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is that the end of it? The Time War.
I'm the only one left.

547
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:45,071  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
I win. How about that?

548
00:42:45,111 --> 00:42:47,188  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Dalek survived.

549
00:42:47,228 --> 00:42:50,068  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Maybe some of your people did too.
I'd know.

550
00:42:50,108 --> 00:42:52,226  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
In here.

551
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:54,221  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Feels like there's no-one.

552
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:58,579  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, then. Good thing
I'm not going anywhere. Yeah.

553
00:42:58,619 --> 00:43:02,370  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
We'd better get out. Van Statten's
gone. They're closing down the base.

554
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:06,647  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Goddard says they're gonna fill it
with cement, like it never existed!
About time.

555
00:43:06,687 --> 00:43:09,564  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll have to go back home.
Better hurry up, then.

556
00:43:09,604 --> 00:43:12,361  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Next flight to Heathrow
leaves at 1500 hours.

557
00:43:12,401 --> 00:43:15,319  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
Adam said that all his life,
he wanted to see the stars.

558
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,356  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell him to go and stand outside,
then. He's all on his own, Doctor.

559
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,552  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
And he did help. He left you there!

560
00:43:21,592 --> 00:43:24,669  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
So did you. What are you talking
about? ! We've got to leave!

561
00:43:24,709 --> 00:43:29,984  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Plus, he's a bit pretty. I hadn't
noticed. On your own head. . .

562
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:32,700  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you doing? She said cement.

563
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:35,533  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
She wasn't joking -
we're gonna get sealed in!

564
00:43:37,651 --> 00:43:39,572  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor?

565
00:43:39,612 --> 00:43:42,808  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are you doing
standing inside a box?

566
00:43:42,848 --> 00:43:45,436  X1:312 X2:405 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose?

567
00:43:48,523 --> 00:43:52,289  X1:078 X2:293 Y1:488 Y2:523
TARDIS THRUMS

human empire.

Planet Earth at its height.

570
00:44:05,505 --> 00:44:08,142  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Kronkburger with cheese,
kronkburger with pajatos.

571
00:44:08,182 --> 00:44:09,861  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Something's wrong.

572
00:44:09,901 --> 00:44:12,018  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
My watch must be wrong.

573
00:44:12,058 --> 00:44:16,773  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Your history's not as good
as you thought. My history's
perfect. Well, obviously not.

574
00:44:16,813 --> 00:44:22,018  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
I can taste it. Engage safety.
'Someone down there
shouldn't be here.'

575
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:26,001  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who are you?

576
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,881  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm the editor.

577
00:44:27,921 --> 00:44:30,793  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's happening? Spike.

WOMAN SCREAMS
