1
00:00:01,789 --> 00:00:05,983  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
Why are we chasing it? It's mauve
and dangerous and about 30 seconds
from London.

2
00:00:06,023 --> 00:00:09,979  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
Excuse me, there's this thing
I need to find, would've fallen
from the sky. . .

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,014  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Nancy, the thing I'm looking for,
you know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

4
00:00:14,054 --> 00:00:15,652  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
A-a-ah!

5
00:00:16,371 --> 00:00:18,968  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've got you, you're fine. Hello.

6
00:00:19,008 --> 00:00:22,085  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hello. Jack Harkness,
I've heard all about you.

7
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:27,158  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's 1941,
the height of the London Blitz and
something else has fallen on London.

8
00:00:27,198 --> 00:00:30,675  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
He said it was a warship, he stole
it, parked it somewhere out there,

9
00:00:30,715 --> 00:00:35,233  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
somewhere a bomb's going to fall
on it unless we make him an offer.
It's a con.

10
00:00:35,273 --> 00:00:37,940  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was conning you, that's
what I am, I'm a con man.

11
00:00:40,187 --> 00:00:42,864  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's something chasing
you and the other kids.

12
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:46,021  X1:236 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy, mummy.

13
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:47,617  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
You mustn't let him touch you.

14
00:00:47,657 --> 00:00:49,936  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
What happens if he touches me?
It makes you like him.

15
00:00:49,976 --> 00:00:54,088  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Right, everybody out, across the
back garden and under the fence.
Now, go, move!

16
00:00:54,128 --> 00:00:59,359  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
You'll find them everywhere, in every
bed in every ward, hundreds of them.

17
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,283  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
They've all got the same injuries,
scarring on the back of the hand

18
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:05,961  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
and the gas mask seems to be fused
to the flesh.
What was the cause of death?

19
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:08,357  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're not dead!

20
00:01:08,397 --> 00:01:10,985  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you my Mummy? It's me Nancy!

21
00:01:11,835 --> 00:01:14,072  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't let 'em touch you.
What happens if they touch us?

22
00:01:14,112 --> 00:01:15,628  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're looking at it!

23
00:01:15,668 --> 00:01:18,051  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
ROBOTIC VOICES: Mummy!

24
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:25,188  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go to your room!

25
00:01:27,854 --> 00:01:29,617  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go to your room!

26
00:01:33,328 --> 00:01:40,370  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I mean it. I'm very, very angry
with you. I'm very, very cross.

27
00:01:42,278 --> 00:01:46,214  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
GO. . .TO. . .YOUR. . .ROOM!

28
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:08,529  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm really glad that worked.

29
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,202  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
Those would have been
terrible last words.

30
00:02:53,362 --> 00:02:56,195  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jamie. . .

31
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:17,853  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why are they all wearing gas masks?

32
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:19,213  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're not.

33
00:03:19,253 --> 00:03:21,252  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Those masks are flesh and bone.

34
00:03:21,292 --> 00:03:24,689  X1:122 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
How was your con supposed to work?
Simple enough, really.

35
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:27,927  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Find some harmless piece of space
junk, let the nearest Time Agent

36
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:30,922  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
track it back to Earth, convince
him it's valuable, and name a price.

37
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:35,961  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
When he's put 50% up-front, oops,
a German bomb falls on it,
destroys it forever.

38
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:39,993  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
He never gets to see what he's
paid for, never knows he's been had.

39
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:43,552  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
I buy him a drink with his own
money and we discuss dumb luck.

40
00:03:43,592 --> 00:03:45,509  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
The perfect, self-cleaning con.

41
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:48,661  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah. Perfect. The London Blitz
is great for self-cleaners.

42
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:51,543  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Pompeii's nice if you want to
make a vacation of it, though.

43
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:54,159  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
But you've got to set
your alarm for Volcano Day.

44
00:03:58,012 --> 00:03:59,930  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Getting a hint of disapproval.

45
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:03,767  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Take a look around the room.
This is what your piece of harmless
space junk did.

46
00:04:03,807 --> 00:04:06,164  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
It was a burnt-out
medical transporter, it was empty.

47
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,765  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose!

48
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:11,283  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are we getting out of here?
We're going upstairs.

49
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:14,959  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
I programmed the flight computer so
it wouldn't land on anything living.
I harmed no-one!

50
00:04:14,999 --> 00:04:17,516  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know what's happening,
but I had nothing to do with it.

51
00:04:17,556 --> 00:04:21,190  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'll tell you what's happening.
You forgot to set your alarm clock.

52
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:24,506  X1:078 X2:469 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's Volcano Day!
AIR-RAID SIREN
What's that?

53
00:04:24,546 --> 00:04:26,306  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
The all clear.

54
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:28,934  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wish.

55
00:04:40,052 --> 00:04:41,280  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah!

56
00:04:45,166 --> 00:04:47,543  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
I thought you were Jamie.

57
00:04:51,596 --> 00:04:53,473  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mum, Dad! Ruddy kids!

58
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:56,795  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
Get off of me!
Get your hands off me!

59
00:04:56,835 --> 00:05:02,866  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oi, you, get in, get in!
Get her in there! She's nicked.

60
00:05:02,906 --> 00:05:06,836  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mr Spock? Doctor.
You got a blaster?

61
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:12,674  X1:318 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sure.

62
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:16,330  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
The night your space junk
landed, someone was hurt.

63
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,845  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
This is where they were taken. 
What happened?  
Let's find out. Get it open.

64
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:23,632  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's wrong with your
sonic screwdriver? Nothing.

65
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:29,399  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Sonic blaster, 51st century.

66
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:32,996  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Weapon factories of Villengard.
You've been to the factories? Once.

67
00:05:33,036 --> 00:05:37,470  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
They're gone now. Main reactor
went critical - vaporised the lot.
Like I said, once.

68
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,907  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's a banana grove there now.

69
00:05:39,947 --> 00:05:41,670  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
I like bananas. Bananas are good.

70
00:05:42,663 --> 00:05:44,778  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nice blast pattern.

71
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:47,418  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Digital. Squareness gun. Yeah.

72
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,261  X1:304 X2:415 Y1:488 Y2:523
I like it.

73
00:05:57,126 --> 00:06:00,086  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
What do you think?
Something got out of here.

74
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:02,443  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah. And?

75
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:04,600  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Something powerful.

76
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,327  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Angry.

77
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:08,454  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Powerful and angry.

78
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:28,414  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:488 Y2:523
A child?

79
00:06:28,454 --> 00:06:30,819  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
I suppose this explains "mummy"?

80
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:32,368  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
How could a child do this?

81
00:06:32,408 --> 00:06:38,093  X1:078 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
TAPE PLAYS:
'Do you know where you are?
Are you my mummy?

82
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:40,801  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Are you aware of what's around you?

83
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:42,807  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Can you. . .see?

84
00:06:42,847 --> 00:06:45,516  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Are you my mummy?

85
00:06:45,556 --> 00:06:48,233  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
'What do you want?
Do you know what. . . ?

86
00:06:48,273 --> 00:06:50,273  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
'I want my mummy!

87
00:06:50,313 --> 00:06:53,150  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Are you my mummy?
I want my mummy.

88
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:55,995  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Are you my mummy?

89
00:06:56,035 --> 00:06:58,423  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Are you my mummy?

90
00:06:58,463 --> 00:07:01,256  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Mummy? Mummy?'

91
00:07:03,095 --> 00:07:05,415  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor, I've heard this voice
before.

92
00:07:05,455 --> 00:07:09,012  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Me too. 'Mummy?'
Always, " Are you my mummy?"

93
00:07:09,052 --> 00:07:11,329  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like he doesn't know. 'Mummy.'

94
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:14,486  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why doesn't he know?
'Are you there, Mummy?

95
00:07:14,526 --> 00:07:16,704  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Mummy!'

96
00:07:20,209 --> 00:07:23,278  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
The police are on their way.

97
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:28,670  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
I pay for the food on this table.
The sweat on my brow, that food is.

98
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,436  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
The sweat on my brow!

99
00:07:30,476 --> 00:07:31,996  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Anything else you'd like?

100
00:07:32,036 --> 00:07:34,345  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've got a whole house here.

101
00:07:34,385 --> 00:07:36,828  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Anything else you'd like
to help yourself to?

102
00:07:36,868 --> 00:07:38,261  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

103
00:07:39,017 --> 00:07:41,136  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'd like some wire-cutters, please.

104
00:07:41,176 --> 00:07:44,490  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Something that can cut through
barbed wire. Oh, and a torch.

105
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:46,971  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't look like that, Mr Lloyd. . .

106
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:51,245  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
I know you got
plenty of tools in 'ere, I've
been watching this house for ages.

107
00:07:51,285 --> 00:07:54,400  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
And I'd like another look
round your kitchen cupboards.

108
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,039  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was in an 'urry the first time.
The food on this table. . .

109
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,835  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
 .is an awful lot of food,
isn't it, Mr Lloyd?

110
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:03,993  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
A lot more than on
anyone else's table.

111
00:08:04,033 --> 00:08:08,630  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
Half this street thinks your missus
must be messing about with
Mr Haverstock, the butcher.

112
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,866  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
But she's not, is she?

113
00:08:10,906 --> 00:08:12,549  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
You are.

114
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:14,818  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Wire-cutters. Torch.

115
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:18,302  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
Food. And I'd like to use your
bathroom before I leave, please.

116
00:08:18,342 --> 00:08:20,492  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, look!

117
00:08:20,532 --> 00:08:22,460  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's the sweat on your brow!

118
00:08:28,686 --> 00:08:32,800  X1:102 X2:615 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Mummy? Please, Mummy? Mummy?'
Doctor?

119
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,761  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can you sense it? Sense what?
Coming out of the walls.

120
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:38,078  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can you feel it? 'Mummy?'

121
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:41,910  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Funny little human brains! How do
you get around in those things?

122
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:44,832  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
When he's stressed, he likes to
insult species. I'm thinking!

123
00:08:44,872 --> 00:08:48,472  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
Cuts himself shaving,
he does half an hour on life-forms
he's cleverer than.

124
00:08:48,512 --> 00:08:51,339  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
There are these children.
Living rough, round the bomb sites.

125
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:54,735  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
They come out during air raids
looking for food. 'Mummy, please?'

126
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:59,333  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
Suppose they were there when this
thing, whatever it was, landed.
It was a med-ship, it was harmless!

127
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:03,646  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
You keep saying harmless.
Suppose one of them was affected,
altered. Altered how?

128
00:09:03,686 --> 00:09:06,763  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
'I'm here!' It's afraid,

129
00:09:06,803 --> 00:09:08,801  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
terribly afraid. And powerful. . .

130
00:09:08,841 --> 00:09:11,269  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
it doesn't know it yet.
But it will do.

131
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:15,847  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's got the power of a god
and I just sent it to its room!

132
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:18,560  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor. . . 'I'm here!

133
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,131  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
'Can't you see me?'
What's that noise?

134
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:26,083  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
End of the tape.
It ran out about 30 seconds ago.

135
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:29,997  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
I sent it to its room.

136
00:09:32,058 --> 00:09:35,050  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is its room!

137
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,401  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Are you my mummy?

138
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:43,332  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Mummy?' Doctor?

139
00:09:44,806 --> 00:09:47,642  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, on my signal,

140
00:09:47,682 --> 00:09:50,001  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
make for the door. . . 'Mummy?' Now!

141
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,538  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Mummy?'

142
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:56,034  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:487
Go, now, don't drop the banana!

143
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:58,127  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why not? Good source of potassium!

144
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:00,554  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gimme that!

145
00:10:00,594 --> 00:10:02,272  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Mummy?'

146
00:10:05,862 --> 00:10:08,779  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:452 Y2:523
Digital rewind.
Nice switch.

147
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:12,096  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's from the groves of Villengard -
thought it was appropriate.

148
00:10:12,136 --> 00:10:16,396  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
There's really a banana grove in the
heart in Villengard? And you did
that? Bananas are good.

149
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:18,009  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

150
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,772  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on!

151
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:26,628  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
ROBOTIC VOICES: Mummy!

152
00:10:35,149 --> 00:10:38,709  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's keeping us here till it can get
at us! It's controlling them?
It is them.

153
00:10:38,749 --> 00:10:40,704  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's every living
thing in this hospital.

154
00:10:40,744 --> 00:10:45,978  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
OK. This can function as a sonic
blaster, a sonic cannon and it's a
triple-enfolded sonic disruptor.

155
00:10:46,018 --> 00:10:49,215  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doc, what you got?
I've got a sonic, uh,. . . Never mind.

156
00:10:49,255 --> 00:10:52,332  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
What? It's sonic,
OK, let's leave it at that.

157
00:10:52,372 --> 00:10:56,095  X1:126 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Disruptor, cannon, what? It's sonic,
totally sonic, I am sonic-ed up!

158
00:10:56,135 --> 00:10:58,427  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
A sonic what? Screwdriver!

159
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,827  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
Going down!

160
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,914  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor, are you OK?
Could've used a warning.

161
00:11:11,954 --> 00:11:13,431  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, the gratitude!

162
00:11:13,471 --> 00:11:15,151  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who has a sonic screwdriver?

163
00:11:15,191 --> 00:11:16,827  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
I do! Lights?

164
00:11:16,867 --> 00:11:20,339  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
Who looks at a screwdriver and
thinks, "Ooh-hoo this could be a
little more sonic?"

165
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,303  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's gotta be a light switch.

166
00:11:22,343 --> 00:11:26,142  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Never had a long night? Never
had a lot of cabinets to put up?

167
00:11:26,182 --> 00:11:27,222  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy!

168
00:11:27,262 --> 00:11:31,761  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
Door! Mummy? Mummy? Mummy?

169
00:11:32,535 --> 00:11:34,095  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Damn it! Mummy?

170
00:11:34,135 --> 00:11:38,395  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's the special features, they
drain the battery. The battery?!

171
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:40,441  X1:274 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's so lame!

172
00:11:40,481 --> 00:11:44,596  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
I was going to send for another one.
But somebody's gotta
blow up the factory.

173
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:48,358  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
I know. First day I met him, he blew
my job up. That's
how he communicates.

174
00:11:48,398 --> 00:11:52,070  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:416 Y2:523
OK, that door should hold it
for a bit. The door?
The wall didn't stop it!

175
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:54,545  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's got to find us first! Come on.
Assets!

176
00:11:54,585 --> 00:11:58,341  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, I've got a banana and in a
pinch you could put up some shelves.

177
00:11:58,381 --> 00:12:02,615  X1:112 X2:607 Y1:452 Y2:523
Window? Barred. Sheer drop outside,
seven storeys. And no other exits.

178
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:05,575  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, the assets conversation
went in a flash, didn't it?

179
00:12:05,615 --> 00:12:08,132  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
So where'd you pick
this one up, then? Doctor!

180
00:12:08,172 --> 00:12:12,851  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
She was hanging from a barrage
balloon, I had an invisible space
ship. . . I never stood a chance.

181
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:15,443  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK! One. . .
we've gotta get out of here.

182
00:12:15,483 --> 00:12:18,520  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
Two. . .we can't get out of here.
Have I missed anything?

183
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,120  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

184
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,724  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jack just disappeared.

185
00:12:30,952 --> 00:12:36,304  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
Thought as much. What are all
of you doing 'ere? Different
house every night, I told ya!

186
00:12:36,344 --> 00:12:41,583  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:416 Y2:523
We thought you were dead
or you'd run off. I didn't.
I knew you'd come back for us.

187
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:48,126  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Found that old thing in the junk.

188
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:50,727  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Thinks he's can write now.
Writing a letter to me dad.

189
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:52,325  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't even know
where your dad is.

190
00:12:52,365 --> 00:12:54,967  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
And how you gonna send it?
I dunno, stick it in an envelope.

191
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:57,878  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
You can't even read or write.
I don't need to, I've got a machine!

192
00:12:57,918 --> 00:13:01,029  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
Will you stop making that noise? !

193
00:13:04,672 --> 00:13:06,713  X1:262 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry, Jim.

194
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:11,013  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
On you go, you write a letter
to your dad if you want to.

195
00:13:15,937 --> 00:13:21,252  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
I know we should've went somewhere
else, but we need you, see,
for the thinking.

196
00:13:21,292 --> 00:13:23,012  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
What if I wasn't 'ere?

197
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,574  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
What if one night
I didn't come back for ya?

198
00:13:25,614 --> 00:13:28,285  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
There's a war on, people go out.

199
00:13:28,325 --> 00:13:32,665  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
They don't always come back.
It happens. What would you do then?

200
00:13:39,081 --> 00:13:41,793  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're wire cutters.

201
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:45,504  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
I need you to think about that.
Someone's gotta look after this lot.

202
00:13:45,544 --> 00:13:50,749  X1:096 X2:623 Y1:452 Y2:523
Why?
You going somewhere? . .The bomb site.

203
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:53,222  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
The one at the railway station.

204
00:13:53,262 --> 00:13:55,679  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why? The Child.

205
00:13:57,173 --> 00:14:01,410  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
That's where he was killed. That's
where it all started. And I'm gonna
find out how.

206
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:05,843  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
He'll get you. And then he'll come
for us. He always comes for us! No.

207
00:14:05,883 --> 00:14:08,604  X1:242 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ernie, he doesn't.

208
00:14:08,644 --> 00:14:10,882  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
He always comes after me.

209
00:14:10,922 --> 00:14:13,122  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
There are things I haven't told ya.

210
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:16,115  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Things I can't tell ya.

211
00:14:16,155 --> 00:14:19,472  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
As long as you're with me,

212
00:14:19,512 --> 00:14:21,789  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
you're in danger. Even right now,

213
00:14:21,829 --> 00:14:25,863  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
you're in danger because of me.
You're the one that keeps us safe.

214
00:14:25,903 --> 00:14:27,259  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
You think so, Ernie?

215
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:28,942  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then answer this.

216
00:14:30,501 --> 00:14:32,674  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:452 Y2:523
Jim is sitting there
right next to ya. . .

217
00:14:33,975 --> 00:14:35,943  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .so who's typing?

218
00:14:54,796 --> 00:14:59,191  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is he coming?
Ernie, as long as you're with me. . .

219
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,489  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
he's always coming.

220
00:15:02,588 --> 00:15:05,614  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
Plenty of greens.
And chew your food!

221
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,610  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, so he vanished into thin air.

222
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:22,323  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Why is it always the great-looking
ones who do that? ! I'm making
an effort not to be insulted.

223
00:15:22,363 --> 00:15:24,244  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
I mean. . . men.

224
00:15:24,284 --> 00:15:26,758  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, thanks, that really helped.

225
00:15:26,798 --> 00:15:29,918  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose? Doctor? Can you hear me?

226
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:33,591  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Back on my ship. . .
used the emergency teleport.

227
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:38,186  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:416 Y2:523
Sorry I couldn't take you,
it's security-keyed
to my molecular structure.

228
00:15:38,226 --> 00:15:40,463  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm working on it.
How are you speaking to us?

229
00:15:40,503 --> 00:15:43,303  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Om-Com - I can call anything
with a speaker grill.

230
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:47,693  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now there's a coincidence! What is?
The Child can Om-Com too. It can?

231
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:49,654  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Anything with a speaker grill.

232
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:53,247  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Even the TARDIS phone. What,
you mean the Child can phone us?

233
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:59,521  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
'And I can hear you. Coming
to find you. Coming to find you!'

234
00:15:59,561 --> 00:16:01,001  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, can you hear that?

235
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:04,160  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Loud and clear. I'll try to block
out the signal. Least I can do.

236
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,996  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Coming to find you, Mummy.'

237
00:16:06,036 --> 00:16:08,917  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Remember this one, Rose?

238
00:16:08,957 --> 00:16:13,183  X1:078 X2:459 Y1:452 Y2:523
MUSIC: "Moonlight Serenade"
by Glenn Miller

239
00:16:14,113 --> 00:16:15,626  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
Our song.

240
00:16:55,584 --> 00:16:57,757  X1:078 X2:255 Y1:488 Y2:523
MUSIC PLAYS

241
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:03,213  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
What you doing?

242
00:17:03,253 --> 00:17:06,970  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
Trying to set up a resonation
pattern in the concrete,
loosen the bars.

243
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:10,129  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
You don't think he's coming back,
do ya? Wouldn't bet my life.

244
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:13,366  X1:110 X2:609 Y1:488 Y2:523
Why don't you trust him? Why do you?

245
00:17:13,406 --> 00:17:17,257  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Saved my life. Bloke-wise,
that's up there with flossing.

246
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:22,117  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
I trust him cos he's like you.

247
00:17:22,157 --> 00:17:25,678  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Except with dating and dancing.

248
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:29,983  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
What?

249
00:17:30,023 --> 00:17:31,705  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
You just assume I'm. . . What?

250
00:17:31,745 --> 00:17:33,741  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
You just assume I don't. . .dance.

251
00:17:33,781 --> 00:17:36,018  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
What? Are you telling me you do. . .

252
00:17:36,058 --> 00:17:37,579  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
dance? 900 years old, me.

253
00:17:37,619 --> 00:17:42,251  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
I've been around. I think you can
assume at some point I've danced.
You? ! Problem?

254
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:46,010  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doesn't the universe implode
or something if you dance?

255
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:48,877  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, I've got the moves
but I wouldn't wanna boast.

256
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:58,088  X1:078 X2:359 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE TURNS MUSIC UP

257
00:18:01,995 --> 00:18:03,671  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:488 Y2:523
You've got the moves?

258
00:18:03,711 --> 00:18:05,984  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
Show me your moves!

259
00:18:06,024 --> 00:18:08,986  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Rose, I'm,
I'm trying to resonate concrete.

260
00:18:09,026 --> 00:18:10,783  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jack'll be back. He'll get us out.

261
00:18:10,823 --> 00:18:14,674  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
So come on. The world doesn't
end cos the Doctor dances.

262
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:26,048  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Barrage balloon? What?

263
00:18:26,088 --> 00:18:29,801  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
You were hanging from a
barrage balloon. Oh, yeah.

264
00:18:29,841 --> 00:18:33,399  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
About two minutes after you left me.
Thousands of feet above London.

265
00:18:33,439 --> 00:18:36,315  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Middle of a German air raid,
Union Jack all over my chest!

266
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:40,953  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
I've travelled with a lot of people,
but you're setting new records for
jeopardy friendly.

267
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:43,348  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is this you dancing?
Cos I've got notes.

268
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:48,101  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Hanging from a rope.
Thousands of feet above London.
Not a cut, not a bruise.

269
00:18:48,141 --> 00:18:50,302  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yeah, I know.
Captain Jack fixed me up.

270
00:18:50,342 --> 00:18:51,982  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
We're calling him Captain Jack now?

271
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:54,614  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, his name's Jack,
and he's a captain.

272
00:18:54,654 --> 00:18:58,533  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's not really a captain, Rose!
You know what I think?

273
00:18:58,573 --> 00:19:01,081  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
I think you're
experiencing captain envy.

274
00:19:02,887 --> 00:19:04,927  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
You will find your feet at
the end of your legs.

275
00:19:04,967 --> 00:19:08,281  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
You may care to move 'em. If ever he
was a captain he's been defrocked.

276
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:09,801  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah? Shame I missed that.

277
00:19:09,841 --> 00:19:11,597  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Actually I quit.

278
00:19:11,637 --> 00:19:13,517  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nobody takes my frock.

279
00:19:13,557 --> 00:19:17,551  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
Most people notice when
they've been teleported.

280
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:20,189  X1:210 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
You guys are so sweet.
Sorry about the delay.

281
00:19:20,229 --> 00:19:23,346  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
Had to take the nav-com off-line to
override the teleport security.

282
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:27,459  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
You can spend ten minutes overriding
your own protocols? Maybe you
should remember whose ship it is!

283
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:30,296  X1:172 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, I do. She was gorgeous.

284
00:19:30,336 --> 00:19:31,936  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Like I told her. . .

285
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:34,333  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
be back in five minutes.

286
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:37,892  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is a Chula ship. Yeah,
just like that medical transporter.

287
00:19:37,932 --> 00:19:40,190  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
Only this one IS dangerous.

288
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:42,966  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
They're what fixed up my hands up.

289
00:19:43,006 --> 00:19:44,762  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jack called them, um. . . Nanobots?

290
00:19:44,802 --> 00:19:48,439  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Nanogenes? Nanogenes, yeah.
Subatomic robots. There's millions
of them in here.

291
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,956  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
See? Burned my hand on the console
when we landed.

292
00:19:50,996 --> 00:19:53,836  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
All better now. They activate when
the bulkhead's sealed,

293
00:19:53,876 --> 00:19:56,339  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
check you out for damage,
fix any physical flaws.

294
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,303  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Take us to the crash site.

295
00:19:59,343 --> 00:20:01,063  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
I need to see your space junk.

296
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:03,381  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Soon as I get the
nav-com back on line.

297
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:04,901  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Make yourselves comfortable.

298
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:08,416  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
Carry on with whatever it was
you were. . .doing.

299
00:20:08,456 --> 00:20:11,256  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
We were talking about dancing.
It didn't look like talking.

300
00:20:11,296 --> 00:20:13,429  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Didn't feel like dancing.

301
00:20:29,797 --> 00:20:31,515  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Halt! Don't move!

302
00:20:34,509 --> 00:20:38,903  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
So you used to be a Time Agent,
and now you're trying to con 'em?

303
00:20:38,943 --> 00:20:42,459  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
If it makes me sound any better,
it's not for the money. For what?

304
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:45,537  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Woke up one morning
when I was still working for them,

305
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:48,774  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
found they'd stolen two years of
my memories. I'd like them back.

306
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:50,331  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
They stole your memories?

307
00:20:50,371 --> 00:20:52,451  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Two years of my life.

308
00:20:52,491 --> 00:20:54,448  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
No idea what I did.

309
00:20:54,488 --> 00:20:59,445  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
Your friend over there doesn't
trust me and for all I know,
he's right not to.

310
00:20:59,485 --> 00:21:02,027  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK! We're good to go!

311
00:21:03,002 --> 00:21:04,759  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
The crash site?

312
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,033  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
As you were. You feeling any better?
Just a touch, sir.

313
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:11,710  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Chain her up where Jenkins
can keep an eye on her.

314
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,787  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
No! Not in here! Not with him.

315
00:21:13,827 --> 00:21:17,104  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
You shouldn't have broken in here
if you didn't want to stay.

316
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:19,501  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:488 Y2:523
You don't understand! Not with him!

317
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,858  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is a restricted area, Miss.

318
00:21:21,898 --> 00:21:25,656  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
You can sit here for a bit,
we're going to have
to ask you a few questions.

319
00:21:25,696 --> 00:21:27,214  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
Found these, sir.

320
00:21:28,773 --> 00:21:32,207  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Very professional.
A little bit too professional.

321
00:21:32,247 --> 00:21:35,847  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Didn't just drop in by accident,
then. My little brother died here.

322
00:21:35,887 --> 00:21:37,563  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wanted to find out
what killed him.

323
00:21:37,603 --> 00:21:40,520  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Take the men, check the
fence for any other breaches.

324
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:43,317  X1:132 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
And search the area,
she may not have come here alone.

325
00:21:43,357 --> 00:21:46,834  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Yes, sir! Please.
Listen, you can't leave me here.

326
00:21:46,874 --> 00:21:49,291  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
Watch her, Jenkins! Yes, Mummy.

327
00:21:51,346 --> 00:21:53,662  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jenkins? Sorry.

328
00:21:53,702 --> 00:21:56,463  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Sir, I don't know what's
the matter with me.

329
00:21:56,503 --> 00:22:01,816  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look, lock me up, fine, but not
here. Please, anywhere but here!

330
00:22:01,856 --> 00:22:03,533  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'll be all right, Miss,

331
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:08,211  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm just a little. . .
just a little. . .just a little. . .

332
00:22:08,251 --> 00:22:11,568  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's the matter with you?
Please. Let me go.

333
00:22:11,608 --> 00:22:15,881  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Why would I do that? Cos you've
got a scar on the back of your hand.
Oh, yes,

334
00:22:15,921 --> 00:22:17,958  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
but what's that got to do with
anything?

335
00:22:17,998 --> 00:22:21,915  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:416 Y2:523
And you feel like you're gonna
be sick. Like something's
forcing its way up your throat.

336
00:22:21,955 --> 00:22:24,069  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
I know because I've seen it before.

337
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:28,346  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
What's happening to me? In a
minute you won't be you any more.

338
00:22:28,386 --> 00:22:30,308  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
You won't even remember you.

339
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:35,102  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
And unless you let me go, it's
going to happen to me too. Please!

340
00:22:35,142 --> 00:22:38,456  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
What are you talking about? What's
your mother's name? Matilda.

341
00:22:38,496 --> 00:22:40,815  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
You got a wife? Yes. Wife's name?

342
00:22:40,855 --> 00:22:43,212  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
You got kids?

343
00:22:43,252 --> 00:22:45,449  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's your name?

344
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:47,209  X1:306 X2:413 Y1:488 Y2:523
Please.

345
00:22:47,249 --> 00:22:49,327  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Let me go. It's too late for you.

346
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,239  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry. But please let me go.

347
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,800  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
What do you m. . . ?

348
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,633  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
M-m-m-mumm-y.

349
00:23:00,673 --> 00:23:02,601  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mumme-e-e-e!

350
00:23:10,982 --> 00:23:12,939  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Well, there it is!

351
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:15,858  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hey, they've got Algy on duty.
Must be important.

352
00:23:15,898 --> 00:23:17,532  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
We've gotta get past.

353
00:23:17,572 --> 00:23:20,974  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
Are the words "distract the guard"
heading in my general direction?

354
00:23:21,014 --> 00:23:23,091  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't think that'd
be such a good idea.

355
00:23:23,131 --> 00:23:25,167  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't worry, I can handle it.

356
00:23:25,207 --> 00:23:28,884  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've got to know Algy quite well,
since I've been in town. Trust me,

357
00:23:28,924 --> 00:23:31,717  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:452 Y2:523
you're not his type.
I'll distract him.

358
00:23:33,999 --> 00:23:35,557  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't wait up!

359
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:41,190  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Relax! He's a 51st-century guy.

360
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:44,304  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's just a bit more flexible
when it comes to dancing.

361
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:45,464  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
How flexible?

362
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:48,820  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
By his time, you lot are
spread out across half the galaxy.

363
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:52,059  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Meaning?
So many species, so little time.

364
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,054  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's what we do when we get out
there? That's our mission?

365
00:23:55,094 --> 00:23:58,412  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
We seek new life and. . .and. . .

366
00:23:58,452 --> 00:24:00,175  X1:310 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dance!

367
00:24:05,085 --> 00:24:06,848  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Hey, tiger. How's it hanging?

368
00:24:09,401 --> 00:24:12,276  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mummy?
Algy, old sport, it's me.

369
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:14,116  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy?!

370
00:24:14,156 --> 00:24:16,031  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's me, Jack!

371
00:24:16,071 --> 00:24:17,999  X1:318 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jack?

372
00:24:18,987 --> 00:24:22,923  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you my. . . mummy?

373
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,032  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Stay back! You men, stay away!

374
00:24:42,604 --> 00:24:46,162  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
The effect's becoming airborne,
accelerating.

375
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:48,130  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's keeping us safe? Nothing.

376
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:51,546  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ah, here they come again.
All we need!

377
00:24:53,036 --> 00:24:55,590  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Didn't you say a bomb
was gonna land here?

378
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:59,663  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
Never mind about that.
If the contaminant's airborne now,
there's hours left. Till what?

379
00:24:59,703 --> 00:25:04,421  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Till nothing! Forever!
For the entire human race.
And can anyone else hear singing?

380
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,578  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Rock-a-bye baby on the tree tops

381
00:25:06,618 --> 00:25:09,055  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
# When the wind blows
the cradle will rock

382
00:25:09,095 --> 00:25:13,691  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
# When the bow breaks the cradle
will fall

383
00:25:13,731 --> 00:25:17,444  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
# Down will come baby
cradle and all. . . #

384
00:25:17,484 --> 00:25:18,484  X1:078 X2:257 Y1:488 Y2:523
DOOR OPENS

385
00:25:18,524 --> 00:25:20,404  X1:078 X2:241 Y1:488 Y2:523
HE MOUTHS

386
00:25:20,444 --> 00:25:25,280  X1:078 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
# Rock-a-bye baby. . .on the tree tops

387
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,886  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
# When the wind blows
the cradle will rock. #

388
00:25:38,106 --> 00:25:41,339  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
You see? Just an ambulance!

389
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:42,859  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's an ambulance?

390
00:25:42,899 --> 00:25:45,217  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's hard to explain, it's. . .

391
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:48,173  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
it's from another world.
They've been trying to get in.

392
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:52,451  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
Of course they have. They think
they've got their hands on Hitler's
secret weapon.

393
00:25:52,491 --> 00:25:56,365  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
What are you doing? When you see
this thing is empty you'll know
I had nothing to do with it.

394
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:57,480  X1:330 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh!

395
00:25:58,925 --> 00:26:03,999  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Didn't happen last time.
It hadn't crashed last time.
There'll be emergency protocols.

396
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:05,967  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, what is that?

397
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,403  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy.

398
00:26:23,777 --> 00:26:25,415  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

399
00:26:27,492 --> 00:26:30,029  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Captain, secure those gates. Why?
Just do it!

400
00:26:30,728 --> 00:26:34,606  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nancy, how did you get in here?
Cut the wire.

401
00:26:34,646 --> 00:26:37,563  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Show Rose. Setting 2428-D.

402
00:26:37,603 --> 00:26:40,020  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
What? Re-attaches barbed wire. Go!

403
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,895  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who are you? Who are any of you?

404
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:02,814  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Never believe me if I told ya.

405
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:05,853  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
You just told me that was an
ambulance from another world.

406
00:27:05,893 --> 00:27:10,526  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
People are running round with gas
mask heads calling for their
mummies, the sky's full of bombs.

407
00:27:10,566 --> 00:27:15,682  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
Tell me, do you think there's
anything left I couldn't believe?

408
00:27:15,722 --> 00:27:20,275  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
We're time travellers
from the future. Mad, you are!

409
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:23,753  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
We have a time travel machine.
Seriously. It's not that.

410
00:27:23,793 --> 00:27:27,826  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
All right, you got a time
travel machine, I'll believe ya.

411
00:27:27,866 --> 00:27:32,251  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Believe anything, me.
 .But what future?

412
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:38,857  X1:196 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nancy, this isn't the end.

413
00:27:38,897 --> 00:27:43,651  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
I know how it looks, it's not the
end of the world or anything.
How can you say that?

414
00:27:43,691 --> 00:27:46,008  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Look at it. Listen to me.

415
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:50,326  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was born in this city. I'm from
here. In like 50 years time.

416
00:27:50,366 --> 00:27:52,324  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
>From here? I'm a Londoner.

417
00:27:52,364 --> 00:27:54,879  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
>From your future.

418
00:27:54,919 --> 00:27:58,434  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
But. . .but you're not. . . What?

419
00:27:58,474 --> 00:28:00,114  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .German.

420
00:28:00,154 --> 00:28:03,515  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nancy, the Germans don't come here.
They don't win.

421
00:28:04,348 --> 00:28:06,825  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't tell anyone I told you so.

422
00:28:06,865 --> 00:28:09,903  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you know what? You win.

423
00:28:09,943 --> 00:28:12,406  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
We win?

424
00:28:13,178 --> 00:28:14,167  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on!

425
00:28:15,656 --> 00:28:18,092  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's empty. Look at it.

426
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:22,609  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
What do you expect
in a Chula Medical Transporter?
Bandages? Cough drops?

427
00:28:22,649 --> 00:28:24,767  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose? I dunno.

428
00:28:24,807 --> 00:28:26,525  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes, you do.

429
00:28:26,565 --> 00:28:29,645  X1:116 X2:603 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nanogenes! It wasn't empty, Captain.

430
00:28:29,685 --> 00:28:33,317  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
There was enough nanogenes
in there to rebuild a species.

431
00:28:33,357 --> 00:28:35,991  X1:142 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, God. Getting it now, are we?

432
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:38,513  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
When the ship crashes,
the nanogenes escape.

433
00:28:38,553 --> 00:28:40,312  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Billions upon billions of them.

434
00:28:40,352 --> 00:28:43,227  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ready to fix all the cuts and
bruises in the whole world.

435
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:45,743  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
But what they find
first is a dead child.

436
00:28:45,783 --> 00:28:47,740  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Probably killed earlier that night.

437
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,340  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
And wearing a gas mask.

438
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:52,578  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
And they brought him back to life?
They can do that? What's life?

439
00:28:52,618 --> 00:28:54,454  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Life's easy. A quirk of matter.

440
00:28:54,494 --> 00:28:56,333  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nature's way of keeping meat fresh.

441
00:28:56,373 --> 00:28:59,332  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nothing to a nanogene.
One problem though.

442
00:28:59,372 --> 00:29:03,965  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
These nanogenes, they're not like
the ones on your ship. This lot have
never seen a human being before.

443
00:29:04,005 --> 00:29:06,322  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Don't know what a human
being's supposed to look like.

444
00:29:06,362 --> 00:29:08,400  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:452 Y2:523
All they've got to go on
is one little body,

445
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,960  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:488 Y2:523
and there's not a lot left.

446
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,155  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:416 Y2:523
But they carry right on,
they do what they're programmed
to do - they patch it up.

447
00:29:14,195 --> 00:29:17,308  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can't tell what's gas mask and
what's skull but they do their best.

448
00:29:17,348 --> 00:29:19,709  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Then off they fly, off they go,
work to be done!

449
00:29:19,749 --> 00:29:22,425  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Cos you see, now they think they
know what people should look like.

450
00:29:22,465 --> 00:29:25,262  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
And it's time to fix all the rest.
And they won't ever stop.

451
00:29:25,302 --> 00:29:27,339  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
They won't ever, ever stop.

452
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:32,459  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
The entire human race is gonna be
torn down and rebuilt in the form
of one terrified child,

453
00:29:32,497 --> 00:29:33,777  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
looking for its mother.

454
00:29:33,817 --> 00:29:36,723  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
And nothing in the world
can stop it! I didn't know.

455
00:29:37,849 --> 00:29:40,716  X1:078 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
BOMBS DROP IN THE DISTANCE

456
00:29:50,716 --> 00:29:53,233  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, Mummy.

457
00:29:53,273 --> 00:29:55,861  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose!

458
00:30:08,218 --> 00:30:10,495  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's bringing the gas-mask people
here.

459
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:13,051  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
The ship thinks it's under attack.
It's calling the troops.

460
00:30:13,091 --> 00:30:16,569  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
Standard protocol. But the gas-mask
people aren't troops!

461
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:19,046  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
They are now.
This is a battlefield ambulance.

462
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:23,883  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
The nanogenes don't just fix you up,
they get you ready for the front
line. Equip you, programme you. . .

463
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:27,233  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's why the Child's so strong?
Why it could do that phoning thing?

464
00:30:27,273 --> 00:30:29,990  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's a fully-equipped
Chula Warrior, yes.

465
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:34,428  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
All that weapons tech in the hands
of an hysterical four-year-old,
looking for his Mummy

466
00:30:34,468 --> 00:30:36,464  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
and now there's an army of them.

467
00:30:36,504 --> 00:30:38,113  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
ALL: Mummy!

468
00:30:39,782 --> 00:30:44,219  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
Why don't they attack?
Good little soldiers.
Waiting for their commander.

469
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,056  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Child!

470
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,892  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jamie. What?

471
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:51,291  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Not the Child, Jamie.

472
00:30:51,331 --> 00:30:53,367  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
So how long until the bomb falls?

473
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:55,487  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Any second.
What's the matter, Captain?

474
00:30:55,527 --> 00:30:57,364  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Bit close to the volcano for you?

475
00:30:57,404 --> 00:30:59,560  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's just a little boy. I know.

476
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,267  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's just a little boy who
wants his Mummy. I know.

477
00:31:03,635 --> 00:31:08,713  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
There isn't a little boy born
who wouldn't tear the world apart
to save his Mummy.

478
00:31:08,753 --> 00:31:11,546  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
And this little boy can.
So what are we gonna do?

479
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,704  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
I don't know.

480
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:17,103  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's my fault.

481
00:31:17,143 --> 00:31:20,101  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
No. It is. It's all my fault.

482
00:31:20,141 --> 00:31:23,787  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
How can it be your. . . ? ALL: Mummy!

483
00:31:34,886 --> 00:31:36,569  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Nancy, what age are you?

484
00:31:38,277 --> 00:31:41,678  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
20, 21? Older than you look, yes?

485
00:31:43,674 --> 00:31:46,541  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor, that bomb. . .
we've got seconds!

486
00:31:47,631 --> 00:31:48,951  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can teleport us out.

487
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:53,585  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Not you guys. The nav-com's back
on line, gonna take too long
to override the protocols.

488
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:55,185  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
So it's Volcano Day.

489
00:31:55,225 --> 00:31:58,097  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do what you've got to do! Jack?

490
00:32:03,016 --> 00:32:05,934  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
How old were you five years ago,
15? 16?

491
00:32:05,974 --> 00:32:08,186  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:488 Y2:523
Old enough to give birth anyway.

492
00:32:09,171 --> 00:32:11,708  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's not your brother, is he?

493
00:32:14,284 --> 00:32:17,358  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Teenage single mother in 1941.

494
00:32:17,398 --> 00:32:20,355  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
So you hid. You lied.

495
00:32:20,395 --> 00:32:23,097  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
You even lied to him.

496
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:29,289  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you my mummy?

497
00:32:30,546 --> 00:32:36,439  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
He's gonna keep asking, Nancy.
He's never gonna stop. Tell him.

498
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:43,892  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Nancy, the future of the
human race is in your hands.

499
00:32:43,932 --> 00:32:46,520  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Trust me and tell him.

500
00:32:48,245 --> 00:32:50,702  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you my mummy?

501
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,089  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you my mummy?

502
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,194  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you my mummy?

503
00:32:58,234 --> 00:33:02,191  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes. Yes, I am your mummy.

504
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:05,627  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mummy? I'm here!

505
00:33:06,984 --> 00:33:08,303  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you my mummy?

506
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:15,935  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm here. Are you my mummy? Yes.

507
00:33:15,975 --> 00:33:17,532  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you my mummy?

508
00:33:17,572 --> 00:33:21,343  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
He doesn't understand,
there's not enough of him left.

509
00:33:22,451 --> 00:33:24,486  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am your mummy.

510
00:33:24,526 --> 00:33:28,564  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I will always be your mummy.

511
00:33:28,604 --> 00:33:30,407  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm so sorry.

512
00:33:32,436 --> 00:33:35,269  X1:242 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am so, so sorry.

513
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,832  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's happening?

514
00:33:41,309 --> 00:33:44,467  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor, it's changing her, we've. . .
Ssh!

515
00:33:44,507 --> 00:33:46,067  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, please!

516
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:51,497  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Come on, you clever little
nanogenes. Figure it out!

517
00:33:51,537 --> 00:33:53,624  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
The mother, she's the mother.

518
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:58,092  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's gotta be enough information.
Figure it out! What's happening?!

519
00:33:58,132 --> 00:34:00,167  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
See?

520
00:34:00,207 --> 00:34:01,725  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
Recognising the same DNA!

521
00:34:08,877 --> 00:34:10,997  X1:268 X2:451 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, come on!

522
00:34:11,037 --> 00:34:12,954  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gimme a day like this!

523
00:34:12,994 --> 00:34:14,876  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gimme this one!

524
00:34:23,225 --> 00:34:25,901  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ha-ha, ha-ha!

525
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:29,574  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Welcome back! 20 years to
pop music, you're gonna love it.

526
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:31,174  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
What happened?

527
00:34:31,214 --> 00:34:33,613  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
The nanogenes recognised
the superior information.

528
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:38,850  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
The parent DNA. They didn't change
you, because you changed them.
Ha-ha!

529
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,807  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mother knows best. Jamie. . .

530
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,127  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor, that bomb. . .

531
00:34:43,167 --> 00:34:46,719  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:488 Y2:523
Taken care of it. How? Psychology.

532
00:34:46,759 --> 00:34:49,176  X1:078 X2:297 Y1:488 Y2:523
BOMB WHISTLES

533
00:34:57,150 --> 00:35:02,183  X1:106 X2:613 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor! Good lad. The
bomb's already commenced detonation.

534
00:35:02,223 --> 00:35:04,780  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
I've put it in stasis,
but it won't last long!

535
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,177  X1:114 X2:605 Y1:416 Y2:523
Change of plan! Don't need the bomb.
Can you get rid of it,
safely as you can?

536
00:35:08,217 --> 00:35:12,022  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose? Yeah? Goodbye!

537
00:35:15,928 --> 00:35:18,510  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:488 Y2:523
By the way. . .loved the t-shirt!

538
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:41,782  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you doing? Software patch.

539
00:35:41,822 --> 00:35:43,539  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Gonna email the upgrade.

540
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:47,100  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
You want moves, Rose.
I'll give you moves!

541
00:35:56,647 --> 00:35:59,401  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everybody lives, Rose.

542
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:01,359  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just this once!

543
00:36:01,399 --> 00:36:03,168  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
Everybody lives!

544
00:36:08,031 --> 00:36:13,065  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:416 Y2:523
Dr Constantine,
who never left his patients.
Back on your feet, constant doctor.

545
00:36:13,105 --> 00:36:16,144  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
World doesn't want to get
by without you just yet

546
00:36:16,184 --> 00:36:17,619  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
and I don't blame it one bit.

547
00:36:17,659 --> 00:36:20,261  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:452 Y2:523
These are your patients.
All better now.

548
00:36:20,301 --> 00:36:23,457  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes. Yes, so it seems.

549
00:36:23,497 --> 00:36:26,815  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
They also seem to be standing around
in a disused railway station.

550
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:29,932  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is there any particular reason for
that? Yeah, well, cutbacks.

551
00:36:29,972 --> 00:36:33,925  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:416 Y2:523
Whatever was wrong with
them in the past you're probably
gonna find that they're cured.

552
00:36:33,965 --> 00:36:38,100  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
Just tell 'em what a
great doctor you are,
don't make a big thing of it. OK?

553
00:36:39,557 --> 00:36:42,189  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Dr Constantine.

554
00:36:42,229 --> 00:36:44,751  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mrs Harcourt,
how much better you're looking!

555
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,070  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
My leg's grown back!

556
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:51,385  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:452 Y2:523
When I come to the hospital,
I had one leg!

557
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:54,701  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well, there is a war on,
is it possible you miscounted?

558
00:36:54,741 --> 00:36:56,699  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Right, you lot, lots to do.

559
00:36:56,739 --> 00:37:00,760  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
Beat the Germans, save the world,
don't forget the welfare state!

560
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:04,293  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
Setting this to self destruct
soon as everybody's clear.

561
00:37:04,333 --> 00:37:06,570  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:452 Y2:523
History says there
was an explosion here.

562
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:09,562  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Who am I to argue with history?
Usually the first in line.

563
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:15,478  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
The nanogenes will clean up their
mess and switch themselves off

564
00:37:15,518 --> 00:37:19,955  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
cos I just told them to.
Nancy and Jamie will go to
Dr Constantine for help. . .ditto.

565
00:37:19,995 --> 00:37:22,352  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
All in all, all things considered,
fantastic!

566
00:37:22,392 --> 00:37:25,189  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Look at you, beaming like you're
Father Christmas! Who says I'm not?

567
00:37:25,229 --> 00:37:28,386  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:488 Y2:523
Red bicycle when you were 12. What?

568
00:37:28,426 --> 00:37:32,063  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:416 Y2:523
Ands everybody lives, Rose.
Everybody lives.
I need more days like this!

569
00:37:32,103 --> 00:37:35,100  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Doctor. . .
Go on, ask me anything. I'm on fire.

570
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:39,605  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:452 Y2:523
What about Jack?
 .Why did he say goodbye?

571
00:37:48,129 --> 00:37:49,682  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK, computer. . .

572
00:37:49,722 --> 00:37:51,840  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
how long can we keep
the bomb in stasis?

573

575
00:37:56,354 --> 00:37:58,114  X1:238 X2:481 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can we jettison it?

576
00:37:58,154 --> 00:38:01,551  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523

578
00:38:04,387 --> 00:38:06,107  X1:136 X2:581 Y1:488 Y2:523
We could stick it in an escape pod?

579
00:38:06,147 --> 00:38:08,185  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
'There is no escape pod on board.'

580
00:38:08,225 --> 00:38:11,142  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, see the flaw in that.
I'll get in the escape pod.

581
00:38:11,182 --> 00:38:14,376  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:452 Y2:523
'There is no escape pod on board.'
Did you check everywhere?

'Affirmative.'

583
00:38:20,892 --> 00:38:22,530  X1:328 X2:389 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK.

584
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:25,327  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
Out of 100, exactly how dead am I?

585

'Termination of Captain Jack

586
00:38:32,675 --> 00:38:35,675  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Lovely, thanks.

587
00:38:35,715 --> 00:38:40,428  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
Good to know the numbers.
'You're welcome.' OK, then!

588
00:38:40,468 --> 00:38:46,162  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:416 Y2:523
Think we'd better initiate
emergency protocol 417.
'Affirmative.'

589
00:38:55,453 --> 00:38:57,133  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ooh, a little too much vermouth.

590
00:38:57,173 --> 00:38:59,886  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
See if I come here again.

591
00:39:01,649 --> 00:39:04,202  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
Funny thing. . .

592
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:10,917  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Last time I was sentenced to death,
I ordered four hyper-vodkas
for my breakfast.

593
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:13,553  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
All a bit of a blur after that.

594
00:39:13,593 --> 00:39:16,390  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:452 Y2:523
Woke up in bed with
both my executioners.

595
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,990  X1:220 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mmm, lovely couple.

596
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:19,948  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
They stayed in touch.

597
00:39:19,988 --> 00:39:22,325  X1:230 X2:487 Y1:452 Y2:523
Can't say that about
most executioners.

598
00:39:25,742 --> 00:39:27,266  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
Anyway. . .

599
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,135  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks for everything, computer. . .

600
00:39:31,175 --> 00:39:33,592  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
it's been great.

603
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:08,391  X1:252 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
OK. . .And turn.

00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:14,091  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, try and spin me again. But this
time don't get my arm up my back!

605

I'm sure I used to know this stuff.
Close the door, will you?

607

there's gonna be a draft.

Welcome to the TARDIS.

609
00:40:27,076 --> 00:40:29,714  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
Much bigger on the inside.
You'd better be.

610

trying to say is. . .you may cut in.

Actually, Doctor, I thought
Jack might like this dance.

616
00:40:46,736 --> 00:40:52,020  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523

absolutely certain. . .but who with?

619
00:41:29,412 --> 00:41:32,486  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
And I was having such a nice day.

620
00:41:32,526 --> 00:41:33,886  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
According to intelligence,

621
00:41:33,926 --> 00:41:36,355  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
the target is the last surviving
member of the Slitheen family,

622
00:41:36,395 --> 00:41:39,437  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
a criminal sect from the planet
Rexicoricophalvitorius,

624
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:44,809  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
This nuclear power station right
in the heart of Cardiff city
will bring jobs for all.

625
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:49,348  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:416 Y2:523
This nuclear power station right
in the heart of Cardiff city

626
00:41:49,388 --> 00:41:51,744  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523

be right on top of the rift.

627
00:41:51,784 --> 00:41:55,066  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:416 Y2:523
If this power station went into
melt-down the entire planet would go
schloop.

628
00:41:57,579 --> 00:41:59,531  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ah, Go on, then, run!

629
00:41:59,571 --> 00:42:01,616  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the rift, the rift's opening.
