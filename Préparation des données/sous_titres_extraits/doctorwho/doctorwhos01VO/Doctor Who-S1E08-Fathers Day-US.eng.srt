1
00:00:03,193 --> 00:00:05,310  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
Peter Alan Tyler, my dad.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,546  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:488 Y2:523
The most wonderful man in the world.

3
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:10,947  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Born 15th September 1954.

4
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:16,587  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come here, Rose. Come here.

5
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:25,330  X1:174 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who's that? It's your daddy.

6
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:29,483  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:452 Y2:523
You weren't old enough
to remember when he died.

7
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:31,200  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
1987.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,320  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
7th of November.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,357  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
D'you remember what I told you?

10
00:00:35,397 --> 00:00:39,835  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
The day that Stuart Hoskins
and Sarah Clark got married.

11
00:00:39,875 --> 00:00:42,672  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
He was always having adventures.

12
00:00:42,712 --> 00:00:45,869  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ah, he would have loved
to have seen you now.

13
00:00:48,386 --> 00:00:50,382  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's what Mum always says.

14
00:00:50,422 --> 00:00:53,099  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
So I was thinking. . .could we?

15
00:00:53,139 --> 00:00:56,535  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Could we go and see my dad,
when he was still alive?

16
00:00:56,575 --> 00:00:58,252  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
Where's this come from
all of a sudden?

17
00:00:58,292 --> 00:01:01,607  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
If we can't, if it goes against the
laws of time or something,

18
00:01:01,647 --> 00:01:05,851  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
never mind, just leave it.
No, I can do anything.
I'm just more worried about you.

19
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:07,331  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wanna see him.

20
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:08,882  X1:188 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
Your wish is my command.

21
00:01:08,922 --> 00:01:10,770  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
But be careful what you wish for. . .

22
00:01:52,356 --> 00:01:58,627  X1:188 X2:431 Y1:416 Y2:423
I, Peter Alan Tyler, take you, 
Jacqueline Andrea Suzette Prentice. . .

23
00:01:58,667 --> 00:02:00,908  X1:234 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:463
I, Peter Alan Tyler,

24
00:02:00,948 --> 00:02:04,310  X1:156 X2:503 Y1:344 Y2:319
take you, Jacqueline Susanne. . .

25
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:07,586  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Suzette. . . Anita?

26
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:15,050  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, just carry on.
If it's good enough for Lady Di. . .

27
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:19,004  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
I thought he'd be taller.
To be my lawful wedded wife.

28
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:23,161  X1:214 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
To love and behold
till death us do part. . .

29
00:02:23,201 --> 00:02:24,957  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
'He died so close to home.'

30
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:29,755  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
I wasn't there, nobody was.

31
00:02:29,795 --> 00:02:32,431  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:488 Y2:523
It was a hit-and-run driver.

32
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:38,385  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:452 Y2:523
Never found out who. He was dead
when the ambulance got there.

33
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:42,082  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
I only wish there'd been
someone there for him.

34
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:47,823  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
'I want to be that someone.

35
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:50,014  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:488 Y2:523
'So he doesn't die alone.'

36
00:02:50,054 --> 00:02:52,801  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
November the 7th? 1987.

37
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:11,369  X1:078 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
MUSIC: "Never Can Say Goodbye"
by the Communards

38
00:03:17,034 --> 00:03:19,302  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's so weird.

39
00:03:19,342 --> 00:03:21,027  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
The day my father died.

40
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:26,335  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
 .I thought it would be
all sort of grim and stormy.
It's just an ordinary day.

41
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,734  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
The past is another country.

42
00:03:28,774 --> 00:03:31,111  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
1987 is just the Isle of Wight.

43
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,901  X1:180 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
You sure about this? Yeah.

44
00:03:47,198 --> 00:03:49,200  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is it, Jordan Road.

45
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:52,747  X1:264 X2:455 Y1:488 Y2:523
He was late. . .

46
00:03:52,787 --> 00:03:55,170  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
He'd been to get a
wedding present, the vase.

47
00:03:56,631 --> 00:03:58,599  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
Mum always said, "That stupid vase."

48
00:04:02,857 --> 00:04:04,540  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
He got out of his car.

49
00:04:06,177 --> 00:04:10,591  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:452 Y2:523
And crossed the road. . .
Oh, God. This is it.

50
00:04:31,393 --> 00:04:33,441  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go to him. Quick!

51
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:45,811  X1:248 X2:471 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's too late now.

52
00:04:45,851 --> 00:04:49,008  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:452 Y2:523
By the time the ambulance
got there, he was dead.

53
00:04:53,646 --> 00:04:55,489  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
He can't die on his own.

54
00:04:57,043 --> 00:04:58,726  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Can I try again?

55
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,784  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:416 Y2:523
Right, that's the first you and me.
It's a very bad idea, two sets
of us being here at the same time.

56
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:22,326  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:416 Y2:523
Just be careful they don't see us,
wait till she runs off and he
follows, then go to your dad.

57
00:05:30,646 --> 00:05:32,364  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, God. This is it.

58
00:05:38,559 --> 00:05:42,233  X1:148 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
I can't do this. You don't have to
do anything you don't want to.

59
00:05:42,273 --> 00:05:44,565  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
But this is the last time
we can be here.

60
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:49,756  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose! No!

61
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,088  X1:308 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
I did it.

62
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:08,644  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:416 Y2:523
I saved your life!
Blimey, see the speed of it?
D'you get his number?

63
00:06:08,684 --> 00:06:10,163  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
I really did it!

64
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:13,759  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
Oh, my God, look at you, you're
alive! That car was gonna kill ya!

65
00:06:13,799 --> 00:06:17,556  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Give me some credit. I did see it
coming. I wasn't gonna walk under it.

66
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:19,035  X1:292 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm Rose.

67
00:06:21,392 --> 00:06:26,627  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, that's a coincidence,
that's my daughter's name.
That's a great name.

68
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,515  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
Good choice. Well done.

69
00:06:33,058 --> 00:06:34,976  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:452 Y2:523
I better shift.
I've got a wedding to go to.

70
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:38,813  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
Is that Sarah Clark's wedding?
Yeah. Are you going? Yeah!

71
00:06:38,853 --> 00:06:41,600  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you and your
boyfriend need a lift?

72
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:49,234  X1:078 X2:245 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREECHING

73
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:53,718  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right, there we go.
Sorry about the mess.

74
00:06:53,758 --> 00:06:57,475  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
If you want a cup of tea, kitchen's
down there, milk's in the fridge,

75
00:06:57,515 --> 00:07:00,878  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
Well it would be, wouldn't it?
Where else would you put the milk?

76
00:07:00,918 --> 00:07:03,630  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mind you, there's always the
windowsill outside.

77
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:06,987  X1:120 X2:599 Y1:452 Y2:523
If someone invented a windowsill with
special compartments -

78
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,857  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:416 Y2:523
one for milk, one for yoghurt -
you could make a lot of money
out of that,

79
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:16,054  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
sell it to students and things.
I should write that down.

80
00:07:16,094 --> 00:07:18,682  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
Anyway, 'scuse me a minute,
gotta go and change.

81
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,365  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
All the stuff Mum kept. His stuff.

82
00:07:24,405 --> 00:07:28,995  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:416 Y2:523
She kept it all packed away in
boxes. She used to show me
when she'd had a bit to drink.

83
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,796  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
Here it is. . .

84
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:35,448  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
on display. Where it should be.

85
00:07:39,471 --> 00:07:41,428  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:488 Y2:523
Third prize at the bowling.

86
00:07:41,468 --> 00:07:43,328  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
First two got to go to Didcot.

87
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,377  X1:266 X2:453 Y1:488 Y2:523
Health drinks!

88
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:51,575  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
Tonics, mum used to call them.
He made his money selling
this Vitex stuff.

89
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:53,952  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
He had all sorts
of jobs, he was so clever.

90
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,327  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
Solar power!

91
00:07:58,367 --> 00:08:01,888  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
Mum said he was going to do this -
now he can!

92
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,205  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
OK, I'll tell him
you're not my boyfriend.

93
00:08:07,245 --> 00:08:10,597  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
When we met, I said, "travel
with me in space." You said no.

94
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:12,274  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then I said, "Time machine".

95
00:08:12,314 --> 00:08:13,910  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:488 Y2:523
It wasn't some big plan.

96
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,301  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:452 Y2:523
I just saw it happening,
and I thought, "I can stop it."

97
00:08:19,825 --> 00:08:24,699  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:416 Y2:523
I picked another stupid ape. I should've known. 
It's not about showing you the universe.

98
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:29,773  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
It never is. It's about the universe
doing something for you.
So it's OK when YOU go to other times,

99
00:08:29,813 --> 00:08:33,130  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
and YOU save people's lives,
but not when it's me saving my dad?

100
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:38,582  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
I know what I'm doing. You don't! Two sets
of us being there made that a vulnerable point. 
But he's alive.

101
00:08:38,622 --> 00:08:43,335  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:416 Y2:523
My entire planet died - my whole family.
Do you think it never occurred to me
to go back and save them?

102
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:46,013  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
But it's not like I've 
changed history. Not much.

103
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:50,930  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:416 Y2:523
I mean, he's never gonna be a world leader. 
He's not gonna start 
World War Three or anything.

104
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,766  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
There's a man alive in the
world who wasn't alive before.

105
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:57,043  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
An ordinary man. That's the
most important thing in creation.

106
00:08:57,083 --> 00:09:02,433  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
The whole world's different because
he's alive. Would you rather him
dead? I'm not saying that. I get it.

107
00:09:02,473 --> 00:09:05,152  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:452 Y2:523
For once, YOU'RE not the
most important man in my life!

108
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:07,987  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
Let's see how you get on without me.
Give me the key.

109
00:09:08,027 --> 00:09:12,223  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:416 Y2:523
The TARDIS key. If I'm so 
insignificant, give it me back!

Oh, Pete!
You never used to like them mental.
Or I don't know, maybe you did.

218
00:16:46,258 --> 00:16:51,216  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:416 Y2:523
Jackie, listen. . . If you're
not careful, there'll be a wedding
and a divorce on the same day.

219
00:16:51,256 --> 00:16:56,248  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:416 Y2:523
Wait here. Give us a minute with the
missus. Straighten the car up, or
stick it round the corner!

220
00:16:56,288 --> 00:16:59,320  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't cause any more trouble!

No, and you never will,

Yes, sir.
I should've done that ages ago.
My dad was out there.

284
00:22:17,743 --> 00:22:20,001  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:488 Y2:523

00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:36,023  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523

303
00:23:37,138 --> 00:23:39,697  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523

304
00:23:39,737 --> 00:23:43,414  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
I dunno. I don't want to know,

Street corner, I'd lost my purse,
didn't have money for a taxi.

00:23:52,082 --> 00:23:54,239  X1:248 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523

309
00:23:54,279 --> 00:23:56,959  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then what? Asked her for a date?

310
00:23:56,999 --> 00:23:59,396  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:452 Y2:523
Wrote his number on
the back of my hand.

311
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:02,877  X1:192 X2:527 Y1:452 Y2:523
Never got rid of her since!
My dad said. . .

312
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,423  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't know what this is all about,

00:24:11,463 --> 00:24:13,266  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who said you're not important?

314
00:24:14,978 --> 00:24:19,533  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:416 Y2:523
I've travelled to all sorts
of places, done things
you couldn't even imagine, but. . .

315
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:20,807  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
you two. . .

00:24:25,089 --> 00:24:27,097  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523

00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:30,680  X1:172 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've never had a life like that.

319
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,440  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yes!

320
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,227  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'll try and save you.

321
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:41,511  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm a dad.

322
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:43,387  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I mean, I'm already a dad, but. . .

323
00:24:43,427 --> 00:24:45,426  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523

324
00:24:45,466 --> 00:24:46,866  X1:290 X2:429 Y1:488 Y2:523
she's you!

325
00:24:46,906 --> 00:24:48,506  X1:246 X2:473 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's wonderful.

326
00:24:48,546 --> 00:24:53,455  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:416 Y2:523
I suppose I thought. . .
that you'd be a bit useless,
with my useless genes.

327
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,094  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
But how did you get here?

328
00:24:57,134 --> 00:24:59,494  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
Do you really wanna know? Yeah.

00:24:59,534 --> 00:25:01,906  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
A time machine.

330
00:25:02,969 --> 00:25:04,249  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Time machine?

331
00:25:04,289 --> 00:25:05,569  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cross my heart.

332
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:09,959  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you all have time machines where
you come from? No, just the Doctor.

333
00:25:09,999 --> 00:25:14,756  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Did you know these. . .
these things were coming? No.

334
00:25:14,796 --> 00:25:17,008  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
God, I dunno, my head's spinning.

335
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:21,632  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
What's the future like?

336
00:25:23,507 --> 00:25:25,302  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not so different.

337
00:25:25,342 --> 00:25:28,089  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
What am I like? Have I gone grey?

338
00:25:31,858 --> 00:25:33,538  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have I gone bald?

339
00:25:33,578 --> 00:25:35,381  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't tell me I've gone bald!

340
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:44,880  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, if this mate of yours isn't your
boyfriend, I have to say I'm glad,

341
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,920  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:452 Y2:523
cos being your dad,
I think he's a bit old for you!

342
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:51,572  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:452 Y2:523
Have you got a bloke?
No. I did have. Mickey!

343
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:59,748  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you know him? I just. . .
didn't recognise him in a suit.

344
00:25:59,788 --> 00:26:02,985  X1:194 X2:523 Y1:416 Y2:523
You have to let go of me,
sweetheart.
 .I'm always saying that.

345
00:26:03,025 --> 00:26:08,298  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:236 Y2:343
He grabs hold of what's passing and
holds on for dear life. God help
his poor girlfriend, if he gets one.

346
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:10,056  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Me and Rose were just talking.

347
00:26:10,096 --> 00:26:16,029  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
Oh, yeah, talking? While the world
comes to an end, what do you do?
Cling to the youngest blonde!

348
00:26:17,529 --> 00:26:19,736  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
Come on, Mick!

349
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:24,559  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
You can't tell her. Why?

350
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:27,875  X1:154 X2:565 Y1:452 Y2:523
I don't want you to tell her.
You don't want people to know?

351
00:26:27,915 --> 00:26:33,313  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:416 Y2:523
Where I come from, Jackie doesn't
know how to work the video recorder.
I showed her that last week!

352
00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:35,389  X1:276 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
Point taken.

353
00:26:35,429 --> 00:26:37,607  X1:078 X2:245 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREECHING

354
00:26:39,984 --> 00:26:45,181  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now, Rose, you're not going to bring
about the end of the world, are you?

355
00:26:45,221 --> 00:26:46,250  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Are you?

356
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:54,486  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jackie gave her to me to look after.

357
00:26:54,526 --> 00:26:56,566  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
How times change.

358
00:26:56,606 --> 00:27:02,080  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:416 Y2:523
I'd better be careful.
I think I just imprinted myself on
Mickey like a mother chicken.

359
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,436  X1:078 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
No! Don't touch the baby.
SCREECHING CONTINUES

360
00:27:08,591 --> 00:27:13,747  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:416 Y2:523
You're the same person, that's
a paradox. We don't want that,
not with these things outside.

361
00:27:13,787 --> 00:27:17,743  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:452 Y2:523
Anything new, any disturbance
in time, makes them stronger.

362
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:20,102  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
A paradox might let them in.

363
00:27:20,142 --> 00:27:22,219  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can't do anything right, can I?

364
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:24,576  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
Since you asked, no. So. . .

365
00:27:24,616 --> 00:27:27,416  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:488 Y2:523
don't touch the baby!

366
00:27:27,456 --> 00:27:30,533  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
I'm not stupid! You could've
fooled me.

367
00:27:34,003 --> 00:27:36,602  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:488 Y2:523
All right,

368
00:27:36,642 --> 00:27:38,331  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

369
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:43,836  X1:158 X2:561 Y1:452 Y2:523
I wasn't really going to
leave you on your own. I know.

370
00:27:43,876 --> 00:27:46,512  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:452 Y2:523
Between you and me,
I haven't got a plan.

371
00:27:46,552 --> 00:27:48,430  X1:300 X2:419 Y1:488 Y2:523
No idea.

372
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:51,230  X1:278 X2:441 Y1:488 Y2:523
No way out.

373
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,587  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
You'll think of something.

374
00:27:53,627 --> 00:27:55,303  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
The entire Earth's been sterilised.

375
00:27:55,343 --> 00:27:59,301  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
This, and other places like it, are
all that's left of the human race.

376
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:04,055  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:416 Y2:523
We might hold out for a while,
but nothing can stop them.
They'll get through,

377
00:28:04,095 --> 00:28:06,252  X1:200 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
the walls aren't that old.

378
00:28:06,292 --> 00:28:09,009  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
And there's nothing I can do
to stop them.

379
00:28:09,049 --> 00:28:14,762  X1:130 X2:587 Y1:416 Y2:523
There used to be laws stopping
this kind of thing from happening.
My people would have stopped this.

380
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:17,480  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
But they're all gone.

381
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,876  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:488 Y2:523
And now I'm going the same way.

382
00:28:19,916 --> 00:28:21,434  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
If I'd realised. . .

383
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:25,833  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Just. . .

384
00:28:26,991 --> 00:28:29,733  X1:216 X2:503 Y1:488 Y2:523
 .tell me you're sorry.

385
00:28:30,827 --> 00:28:32,347  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am.

386
00:28:32,387 --> 00:28:34,963  X1:292 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm sorry.

387
00:28:45,654 --> 00:28:46,967  X1:320 X2:397 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doc?

388
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:49,060  X1:170 X2:547 Y1:488 Y2:523
Have you got something hot?

389
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:51,312  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Agh!

390
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,161  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's the TARDIS key!

391
00:29:01,711 --> 00:29:04,949  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
It's telling me it's still
connected to the TARDIS!

392
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:09,464  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:416 Y2:523
The inside of my ship was thrown out
of the wound, but we can use this
to bring it back.

393
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:15,898  X1:134 X2:585 Y1:416 Y2:523
And once I've got my ship back,
I can mend everything! I just need
power. Has anybody got a battery?

394
00:29:15,938 --> 00:29:17,422  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:488 Y2:523
This one big enough?

395
00:29:19,213 --> 00:29:22,249  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:452 Y2:523
Fantastic! Good old dad.
There you go.

396
00:29:22,289 --> 00:29:25,966  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:452 Y2:523
Just need to do a bit
of charging up,

397
00:29:26,006 --> 00:29:29,367  X1:122 X2:597 Y1:488 Y2:523
and then we can bring everyone back.

398
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,306  X1:078 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREECHING, CRASH AT DOOR

399
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:38,701  X1:078 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREECHING AND CRASHING CONTINUES

400
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:56,096  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:452 Y2:523
You, um, you never said why you
came here in the first place.

401
00:29:56,136 --> 00:30:01,887  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:416 Y2:523
If I had a time machine, I wouldn't
have thought 1987 was anything
special. Not round 'ere, anyway!

402
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:03,487  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
We just ended up 'ere.

403
00:30:03,527 --> 00:30:06,999  X1:128 X2:591 Y1:452 Y2:523
Lucky for me, eh?
If you hadn't been there to save me.

404
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:11,838  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:452 Y2:523
That was just a coincidence.
That was just really good luck.

405
00:30:11,878 --> 00:30:13,362  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's amazing.

406
00:30:16,032 --> 00:30:20,332  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
So, in the future, um, are me
and her indoors still together?

407
00:30:21,349 --> 00:30:23,026  X1:316 X2:403 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yeah.

408
00:30:23,066 --> 00:30:25,302  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
You still livin' with us?

409
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:26,906  X1:324 X2:395 Y1:488 Y2:523
Yep.

410
00:30:30,461 --> 00:30:32,019  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:488 Y2:523
Am I a good dad?

411
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:37,293  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
You. . .

412
00:30:39,726 --> 00:30:43,683  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
You told me a bedtime story
every night, when I was small.

413
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:47,540  X1:208 X2:511 Y1:452 Y2:523
You were always there,
you never missed one.

414
00:30:51,714 --> 00:30:53,363  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
And. . .um. . .

415
00:30:55,229 --> 00:30:59,620  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:452 Y2:523
 .you took us for picnics
in the country every Saturday.

416
00:31:00,548 --> 00:31:02,470  X1:210 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
You never let us down.

417
00:31:04,221 --> 00:31:07,059  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
You were there for us all the time.

418
00:31:07,099 --> 00:31:09,926  X1:160 X2:557 Y1:488 Y2:523
Someone I could really rely on.

419
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:17,883  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
That's not me.

420
00:31:38,305 --> 00:31:42,701  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:452 Y2:523
Right, no-one touches that key!
Have you got that? Don't touch it.

421
00:31:42,741 --> 00:31:46,217  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
Anyone touches that key,
it'll be. . .well, zap!

422
00:31:46,257 --> 00:31:51,211  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:416 Y2:523
Leave it be, and everything
will be fine. We'll get out of here.
All of us. Stuart. Sarah!

423
00:31:51,251 --> 00:31:53,529  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:452 Y2:523
You're gonna get married,
just like I said!

424
00:31:53,569 --> 00:31:55,827  X1:078 X2:245 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREECHING

425
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,222  X1:078 X2:249 Y1:488 Y2:523
THRUMMING

426
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,338  X1:126 X2:593 Y1:452 Y2:523
When time gets sorted. . . Everybody
here forgets what happened.

427
00:32:23,378 --> 00:32:27,650  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:452 Y2:523
And don't worry, the thing that
you changed will. . .stay changed.

428
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,329  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:488 Y2:523
You mean, I'll still be alive.

429
00:32:30,369 --> 00:32:32,866  X1:166 X2:553 Y1:488 Y2:523
Though I'm meant to be dead.

430
00:32:37,439 --> 00:32:41,438  X1:124 X2:595 Y1:452 Y2:523
That's why I've haven't done anything
with my life. Why it meant nothing.

431
00:32:41,478 --> 00:32:43,874  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doesn't work like that. Rubbish.

432
00:32:43,914 --> 00:32:47,231  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:452 Y2:523
I was so useless,
I couldn't even die properly!

433
00:32:47,271 --> 00:32:50,827  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:452 Y2:523
Now it's my fault all this
has happened. This is my fault.

434
00:32:50,867 --> 00:32:52,467  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:488 Y2:523
No, love.

435
00:32:52,507 --> 00:32:54,103  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm your dad.

436
00:32:54,143 --> 00:32:56,303  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's my job for it to be my fault.

437
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:57,622  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Her dad?

438
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,340  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
How are you her dad?

439
00:33:01,537 --> 00:33:03,134  X1:214 X2:505 Y1:488 Y2:523
How old were you, 12?

440
00:33:03,174 --> 00:33:04,812  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, that's disgusting!

441
00:33:04,852 --> 00:33:07,487  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jacks, listen.

442
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,445  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:488 Y2:523
This is Rose.

443
00:33:09,485 --> 00:33:15,559  X1:104 X2:615 Y1:416 Y2:523
Rose? ! How sick is that? ! Did you
give my daughter a second-hand name?
How many are there?

444
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,575  X1:118 X2:601 Y1:452 Y2:523
Do you call them all Rose? ! Oh, for
God's sake, look! It's the same Rose.

445
00:33:21,113 --> 00:33:22,922  X1:286 X2:433 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose! No!

446
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:28,091  X1:078 X2:503 Y1:452 Y2:523
THEY ALL SCREAM
Everyone, behind me!

447
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:44,523  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm the oldest thing in here!

448
00:33:46,686 --> 00:33:48,938  X1:306 X2:411 Y1:488 Y2:523
Doctor!

449
00:34:11,343 --> 00:34:13,061  X1:310 X2:409 Y1:488 Y2:523
Cold. . .

450
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:16,387  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's cold.

451
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:23,023  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, my God, he's dead.

452
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,682  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's all my fault.

453
00:34:29,722 --> 00:34:32,598  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:488 Y2:523
Both of you! All of you!

454
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:35,076  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
The whole world! Ah, come on!

455
00:34:35,116 --> 00:34:37,863  X1:078 X2:371 Y1:488 Y2:523
SCREECHING RESUMES

456
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:48,368  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:452 Y2:523
This is it. There's nothing
we can do. It's the end.

457
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,027  X1:142 X2:577 Y1:488 Y2:523
The Doctor really cared about you.

458
00:35:58,067 --> 00:36:03,105  X1:130 X2:589 Y1:452 Y2:523
He didn't want you to go through it
again, not if there was another way.

459
00:36:03,145 --> 00:36:05,198  X1:254 X2:465 Y1:488 Y2:523
Now there isn't.

460
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:09,972  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:488 Y2:523
What are you talking about?

461
00:36:10,012 --> 00:36:14,648  X1:136 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
The car that should have killed me,
love. It's here.

462
00:36:18,524 --> 00:36:21,920  X1:138 X2:581 Y1:452 Y2:523
The Doctor worked it out way back,
but he, um. . .

463
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,753  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:488 Y2:523
he tried to protect me.

464
00:36:27,555 --> 00:36:29,394  X1:312 X2:407 Y1:488 Y2:523
Still. . .

465
00:36:29,434 --> 00:36:31,910  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:488 Y2:523
He's not in charge any more.

466
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,190  X1:320 X2:399 Y1:488 Y2:523
I am.

467
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,948  X1:256 X2:463 Y1:488 Y2:523
But you can't. . .

468
00:36:35,988 --> 00:36:38,690  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:488 Y2:523
Who am I, love?

469
00:36:39,703 --> 00:36:41,227  X1:288 X2:431 Y1:488 Y2:523
My daddy.

470
00:36:44,178 --> 00:36:46,385  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
Jackie, look at her.

471
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:49,785  X1:284 X2:435 Y1:488 Y2:523
She's ours.

472
00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:58,403  X1:296 X2:423 Y1:488 Y2:523
Oh, God.

473
00:37:05,076 --> 00:37:07,453  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:488 Y2:523
I'm meant to be dead, Jackie.

474
00:37:08,592 --> 00:37:10,669  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
You're gonna get rid of me at last.

475
00:37:10,709 --> 00:37:12,228  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:488 Y2:523
Don't say that.

476
00:37:12,268 --> 00:37:15,508  X1:162 X2:555 Y1:452 Y2:523
For once in your life, trust me.
It's gotta be done.

477
00:37:15,548 --> 00:37:19,433  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:452 Y2:523
You've got to survive, cos you've
got to bring up our daughter.

478
00:37:33,003 --> 00:37:37,638  X1:134 X2:583 Y1:452 Y2:523
I never read those bedtime stories,
I never took you on those picnics.

479
00:37:37,678 --> 00:37:39,398  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:488 Y2:523
I was never there for you.

480
00:37:39,438 --> 00:37:41,917  X1:232 X2:487 Y1:488 Y2:523
You would've been.

481
00:37:41,957 --> 00:37:44,794  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
But I can do this for you.

482
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:46,711  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:488 Y2:523
I can be a proper dad to you now.

483
00:37:46,751 --> 00:37:48,351  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:488 Y2:523
It's not fair.

484
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:50,948  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
I've had all these extra hours.

485
00:37:50,988 --> 00:37:53,946  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:452 Y2:523
No-one else in the world
has ever had that.

486
00:37:53,986 --> 00:37:55,862  X1:234 X2:483 Y1:488 Y2:523
And on top of that,

487
00:37:55,902 --> 00:37:57,420  X1:250 X2:467 Y1:488 Y2:523
I get to see you.

488
00:38:00,179 --> 00:38:02,761  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:488 Y2:523
And you're beautiful.

489
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:07,646  X1:226 X2:493 Y1:488 Y2:523
How lucky am I, eh?

490
00:38:07,686 --> 00:38:10,843  X1:140 X2:579 Y1:488 Y2:523
So, come on, do as your dad says.

491
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:21,282  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
You gonna be there for me, love?

492
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:26,917  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:488 Y2:523
Thanks for saving me.

SCREECHING

494
00:38:57,154 --> 00:38:59,274  X1:078 X2:285 Y1:488 Y2:523
TYRES SCREECH

495
00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:01,526  X1:258 X2:461 Y1:488 Y2:523
Goodbye, love.

496
00:39:18,139 --> 00:39:20,391  X1:240 X2:479 Y1:488 Y2:523
Go to him. Quick.

497
00:40:10,517 --> 00:40:13,402  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:488 Y2:523
The driver was just a kid.

498
00:40:13,442 --> 00:40:15,511  X1:276 X2:443 Y1:488 Y2:523
He stopped,

499
00:40:15,551 --> 00:40:17,311  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:488 Y2:523
he waited for the police.

500
00:40:17,351 --> 00:40:19,267  X1:240 X2:477 Y1:488 Y2:523
It wasn't his fault.

501
00:40:19,307 --> 00:40:22,134  X1:132 X2:587 Y1:488 Y2:523
For some reason, Pete just ran out.

502
00:40:24,710 --> 00:40:26,899  X1:156 X2:563 Y1:488 Y2:523
People say there was this girl. . .

503
00:40:26,939 --> 00:40:32,348  X1:146 X2:573 Y1:452 Y2:523
And she sat with Pete while
he was dying. She held his hand.

504
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,989  X1:230 X2:489 Y1:488 Y2:523
Then she was gone.

505
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:40,687  X1:166 X2:551 Y1:488 Y2:523
Never found out who she was.

506
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:08,254  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Peter Alan Tyler, my dad.

507
00:41:08,294 --> 00:41:11,087  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:452 Y2:523
'The most wonderful man
in the world.

508
00:41:12,491 --> 00:41:15,198  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:488 Y2:523
'Died the 7th of November 1987.'

509
00:41:31,274 --> 00:41:32,629  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:488 Y2:523
And why are we chasing it?

510
00:41:32,669 --> 00:41:37,134  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:416 Y2:523
It's mauve and dangerous, and about
30 seconds from the centre of London.

511
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:41,841  X1:144 X2:575 Y1:488 Y2:523
Rose! Please let me in, Mummy.

512
00:41:42,903 --> 00:41:43,847  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:452 Y2:523
You mustn't let him touch ya!
Are you a doctor? I have my moments.

513
00:41:43,863 --> 00:41:46,115  X1:108 X2:611 Y1:452 Y2:523
You mustn't let him touch ya!
Are you a doctor? I have my moments.

514
00:41:46,573 --> 00:41:50,330  X1:148 X2:531 Y1:488 Y2:523
They've all got the same injuries.
Right down to the scar on the back of their hand.

515
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:54,291  X1:174 X2:545 Y1:488 Y2:523
Physical injuries. . .as plague.

516
00:41:54,331 --> 00:41:58,601  X1:120 X2:597 Y1:452 Y2:523
Hello. Hello.
Shall we have a drink on the balcony?

517
00:41:58,961 --> 00:42:00,201  X1:322 X2:397 Y1:488 Y2:523
Ooh!

518
00:42:00,241 --> 00:42:04,581  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:452 Y2:523
Ooh, I like to think of myself
as a criminal. I bet you do!

519
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,654  X1:078 X2:265 Y1:488 Y2:523
SHE SCREAMS
